<p>瑞士國京城　德意志勞工報頃載稱、波蘭國境內東路德軍業已開至德蘇兩國政府所商定之界綫、此項界錢究係德國外長里賓特洛浦前此在莫斯科時所商定者、抑以蘇聯軍隊所已開到之處為準則、該報並未加以說明、關於此事、德國官塲人士亦未發表何項談話、僅謂德蘇兩方界綫、已由一九一七年勃勒斯列多佛斯篤克條的予以規定、此間消息靈通人士則謂、蘇聯軍隊、早已越過此綫甚遠云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>羅馬尼亞國京城　波蘭國邊境與羅馬尼亞國毘連部份、自蘇聯紅軍全部予以佔領之後、此間一般印象、咸以為德國已聽任某種力量、挿入中歐洲、無法加以控制、必於該國利益有害、德國半官方面前會發出表示、謂該國苟能與羅國壤土相接、實屬有益之舉、茲此種希望、已歸於泡影、此外蘇聯又已與匈牙利國喀爾巴阡烏克蘭人相接觸、斯洛伐克邦乃至德國保護地波希來亞摩拉維亞兩省、亦且感受蘇聯之影饗、日來各該地方居民、巳有叛變情事、今後必受蘇聯之鼓勵、並受德國政治警察嚴厲的鎮壓、而加強其脫高德國統治之決心云、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>巴黎　英軍繼續開入法國、雖不能舉其人數、惟悉因英法海空兩軍聯合工作之結果、赴法英軍、刻循可保不受任何攻擊之安全走道、移入法國、此走道之存在、亦使英法兩國間之尋常海空交通、為之改善、此間未得央軍活動之消息、聞法當局對於英軍之體格與訓練及適於戰事新狀況、頗為欣慰、（二十一日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　據法人意見、德方砲火並無特殊之處、雖其飛機工作頗佳、然法國飛機亦能容易應付之、此時乃戰術上靜待時期、法軍刻正肅淸其所得地方、華恩特森林中、佈滿地雷與陷穽、凡貌似無害之藩籬等物、稍誤觸之、則爆炸立作、此不僅森林中如此、他處亦然、故法軍每佔一地、輒須作肅淸工作、又據法方報吿、德方已在阿坎鎮後集有飛機一千五百架、並有工人甚多、沿盧森堡邊界趕速加強西格斐陣綫、一般海軍著作家皆謂希特勒在開戰時所有可駛入大洋之潛艇、不過五十艘、今已被擊沉者之數、如英相張伯倫在下院所報吿者、巳佔頗大比例、而英輪之喪失者則瀕減少、法方亦相信曾擊毀德潛艇至少五艘、一般人頂料德方此後行動、殆將以海上快艦較英方護送艦更為堅強者攻擊英輪、（二十一日路透電）</p>

<p>德國元首希特勒氏十九日在但澤演說，英國首相張伯倫氏二十日在國會演說、其辭俱刊昨報。檢討雙方演辭，對於歐局現狀，絕無何種補充或修正，殊無新意義可言，斯吾人亦無自而作何新估價。在此波蘭軍隊潰敗之後，蘇聯出兵，蘇德兩國瓜分波蘭將告完竣之際，歐戰之理論與爭議之對象，各有事實上之變遷；則英德兩國當局及時而有所新提示；或讐對愈甚，或急轉直下，要為事理之常，顧乃未然；是為世界大局言之，不能不失望於兩氏之演說。</p>
<p>依據兩氏演說，未見停止戰事狀態之絲毫理由，而歐戰之必持續進行，乃其當然之結論。波蘭既覆，東綫戰事有結束之觀；此後主要戰爭，在法國馬奇諾陣綫與德國西格斐陣綫之間。蓋就海軍言之，德對英法，實力懸殊，殆無主力戰之可言；空軍無遠弗屆，應由此决戰爭創歷史之新紀錄，然雙方大致工力悉敵，各有顧忌，則其一初期運用，殆僅為與陸軍相呼應，活躍於德法交界之上空耳。昨晚消息，英軍渡海而至法國前綫者，因穩安而便捷之聯絡綫經營就緒，已得如期到達；德國之統師與陸空兩軍，亦已自東綫調集西綫；雙方如此調遣，允見今後歐戰重心之所在矣。</p>
<p>戰爭勝敗，決於主力之交綏，經濟之耐久，毆戰當不外是；雖然，以歐戰之現階段而論，促使局向變化者，於軍事與經濟之外，猶別有所在，即歐洲各國之悲歡離合，各民族之恩怨向背是也。英法與德，以軍事與經濟決勝負之日猶遠；而今日之各國各民族表面上雖惟保持中立是亟，實際上因中立之終難保持，而已準備有所作為；彼由準備而發為行動，殆為指顧間事耳。如蘇聯，已有行動於波蘭，而對英德號稱中立；夫以蘇聯在地理所佔特殊形勢而論，於其有得於波蘭之後，確有自此堅壁淸野，回復中立之可能；然中歐東歐，夙多紛擾，如關主義信仰，民族感情，既足牽動蘇聯，而蘇聯對羅馬尼亞國，對裹海波羅的海乃至對地中海之意念如何，要亦莫能保證蘇聯之必殆終堅壁淸野。如義大利與西班牙，大致與德國之利害矛盾在陸，與英法之利害矛盾在海；迨戰局遷延，行見德國脅之，英法誘之；利害權衡原非易辨，而近憂遠慮復相異觀，然必須抉擇其一也。如匈牙利羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫諸國，及至波蘭之慘敗，即已直接感受威脅；彼近顧目前之安全，遠念方來之禍患，對蘇德兩國，迎拒皆非者也。凡此諸國者，以其一國之力量，凡彼行動向背，胥未足以決定歐戰勝負，然所得影響於戰局之發展者，至為深刻；若乃合縱連橫沆瀣一氣，則無論其為共通對英法，或合力制德國，必將為雙方最後勝負之重要因素，是可斷言。是以今日之英法與德，固必竭全力以從事於軍事經濟國爭，而所以捭闔於各國之間者，殆為雙方所最亟也。抑不但各國而己，如奧地利族，如捷克斯拉夫族，如猶太族，乃至如波蘭人民，，先後嘗亡國之痛，舊仇新怨，創深痛鉅；凡此民族之親疏，主義之愛憎，‘固將為彼動嚮之基調，然國家興亡之爭，必超越感情與信仰之偏見以求之。彼交戰國之政府，可以部勒軍隊，可以統制物資，如何可以使此抑鬱之民族甘受覊縻？昨傳捷克舊邦，德國新屬之波希米亞及摩拉維亞省乃至斯洛伐克西部，相决發生革命，勢所必至，非意外也。</p>
<p>西綫戰事如何，自是不容忽視；然允值得注意者，乃爲歐洲各中立國之動態，軍事萬難速決，然國際動態則有急轉直下之可能者也。</p>

<p>英金達四便士半</p>
<p>後市因在一時許市上突有華北日本駐軍撤退之無稽謠傳、故開後賣風軍熾、華行東亞等與華商證券帮均競相塞出、雖日行正金趁賤吸收、但因外行吃胃不強、致市勢頗形鬆濫、計華商與華行相繼吐予外行大通有利及日行正金現貨英金由四便士三七五、硬逮半便士、並現貨美匯由匕兀一二五、長至四三七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英余四便士半、美匯七元四〇六二五、本月份與現貨相同、十月份英金四便士四五三一二五、美滙七元二五、結果比隔昨、現貨與本月英均鬆二五、美亦均硬五三一二五、十月份英賤二三四三七五、美長五六二五、</p>

<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗盤市況、跌風盛熾價已退至三千七百元關邊、蓋因中日和平傳說日盛、竟謂日本前首相近衛已飛抵海防河內、及華北日本駐軍已撒退等種種無稽謠風籠罩下、且中政府已將黃金收歸國有、一再聲述由中中交農四行收購、故各方人心更形處萎、外滙猛鬆、金價更疲莫能興、自晨即承前晚之跌風、開市即降至三千七百五十元、俄因外滙出鬆回平、且客帮見低傾進、一度激起漲風、會飛上見三千八百九十元高價、近午和平空氣突濃、且港帮忽來出籠、市勢轉疲、午收後已做低至三千八百元內、下午傳日本撇退華北駐軍、中日和平有實現謠傳、加以外滙劇鬆、證券帮又傾向拋售、更助長已熾跌風、竟狂瀉見三千七百元低價、終因無貨解出者抵進、拉上至三千七百三十元收市、軋過猛跌二百五十元、全日交易共的三千數百兩、首飾金亦跌至三百七十五元、關金及中英純金等一致呆平、</p>

<p>飾金再小十五元</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫題詹念曾合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓　（時間）上午十時至下午六時　星期日休息</p>
<p>月兒彎彎照九洲，幾家歡樂幾家愁；　幾家夫婦同羅帳，幾家飄零在外頭？</p>
<p>中秋是團圓節，在離別着的愛侶—尤其是閨中少婦，逢此花好月圓，佳節良宵，沒有不彌增離別之恨，大興「望月思悄」之慨的！所以有着愛侶的丈夫，每不遠千里而米，俾傾積愫而共度此佳節的。這也是丈夫體諒愛妻所應盡之夫道。如此，豈不因別離而益增繼綣而歡暢之情愛？誠然男健女美，由離別而合歡，直猶如久早逢甘雨，不特有裨身心，並且在夫婦的關係上建築着鞏固之基礎，於是夫唱婦隨，以後即不忍分離，生男育女，組織着美滿的家庭，是何等的幸福！可是也有許多夫婦，老是廝混在一起，宜其團圓而美滿了。然而恒演出同床異夢，貌合神離，或竟與人私通私奔，或竟明目張膽與夫訴請離婚…等種種之悲劇，這豈非由合而反生離悲！</p>
<p>夫婦間之離合悲歡，何其若是之變幻多端，據醫學上之論斷，其間關鍵，唯在性能之是吾健康？男子而精力豐沛，愛慾熱烈，誰願意別離其嬌妻？雖迫於環境，亦必時常的覓團圓之機會，何況在此佳節良宵！反之，男子如於早年犯有自凟遺精，或早婚縱慾，把主宰性能健康的生殖腺液消耗枯竭，則凡腎萎早洩，發育不全，未老先衰，神經衰弱，久婚不育等症叢生，此種病夫，雖有美眷如花，在此佳節良宵相團圓，在愛的生活中亦必表現着衰弱無能，或竟完全不能人道，這怎能不引起妻子惱恨，而感情冰炭，夫婦悲劇的原因，大都即由於此。</p>
<p>有病自己知，男子如有上述各症，應早作治療之計，俾免陷入悲慘之命運！治療之法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服生殖腺素裂劑「生殖素」最為對症特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，海狗等體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成，所以品質高貴，補力偉大，服後於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，繼續服用，更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，必可於短期內根治各症，秋冬常服，可收延年益壽，返老還童之功。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（永安光施西藥部及五洲中西等大藥房均售）以鞏固精關，制止潰洩，則治標治本並施，收效必更為神速！</p>
<h3 id="c72">遺精青年速治的必要 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>在社會淫靡與性教育缺乏的今日，一般靑年犯有自凟及患遺精症人數的多，實為民挨健康前途一個嚴重的隱憂！據某性病專家實地的調查統計，知道在春情發動期犯有自凟惡癖的靑年，幾佔百分之九十以上。於春悄發動期後由患有遺精症者，亦佔百分之八十以上。</p>
<p>何以有遺精症？據醫學上的論斷，大都因自凟縱慾，早婚荒淫，斷傷了性神經，減弱了精關的管束機能，於是雖受性感的刺激，即可有精液遺洩，至症象惡化的時候，雖無性感刺激，亦可有精液遺洩，這就所謂滑精漏精症。</p>
<p>精液是我們生命的原泉，除營生殖作用外，更能由腺器官直接滲入血液內而週行全身，功能助長發育，調整新陳代謝，滋養腦，脊髓，性各部神經，更能增加體內對疾病之抵抗能力，所以患有遺精症者而復因循失治，致精枯血竭以後，則凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎萎早洩，發育不全，未老先衰等症即相繼沓來，此種靑年，為病痛所纏繞，在學術與專業上之前途必摧毀無遺，即在人生不可少的夫婦生活上亦幸福喪盡，甚至一病嗚呼，為短命之鬼！遺精症應及早治愈，我們已再三申論之矣，因為早治可元氣少虧，治愈亦較易，然無論遺精症之新久輕重，欲求根治，據中外名醫及余經驗，均以服「希米脫氏固精片」最為對症特效。因此藥於服後即可鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，收安眠止遺之實效。如因遺精而已有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以根本培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，繼續服用更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，必於短期內根治各症，中老年人常服更可延年益壽，返老還童。</p>
<p>患者張廣源君，因遺精數載，虧損已極，日不能思，夜不成寐，婚後從未生育，夫婦感情形同冰炭，暑期內就余診治，除囑其在五洲大藥房購服「希米晚氏固精片」及「生殖素」作標本兼治外，幷施以電療注射等新法，一月於茲，果已精力康復，重享康樂了！</p>

<h3 id="c73">從人月雙圓說到　乳峯發育的重要！ <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>韶華易逝，又到了金風送爽，玉露橫秋的仲秋季候了。人們每到了這個時候，允其是一般年輕愛美的女太太們，無不喜上眉梢，大事活動，因為這時的熱浪已退，嚴寒未至，身體上既覺輕鬆舒適，而時序又復節近中秋，於是購紛呀，買脂呀，添製新裝呀，濃粧艷抹，在高爽的秋光中，一顯窈窕之身。至於我們鬚眉男子呢？自然也要採購一些月餅，酒果之類，預備一到中秋，與妻子兒女們一室團敘，共慶『人月雙圓』。</p>
<p>『人月雙圓』這是多麼幸福的環境啊！然而當此社會動亂，而尤其是審美觀念大異於昔的今已日，有很多的女性，因為身體發育的不佳，如乳峯萎　，臀部瘦削，肌肉枯搞……而被男子們厭惡，或遺棄不顧，飽嘗人世間的慘痛！她們是空閨獨守，孤衾寡歡，雖然佳節當前，亦祇有徒增根觸，更何有快榮之可言？欲謀補救，祗有積極服以生殖腺卯巢製劑女用『生殖素』，最為準確而可靠。蓋乳峯萎　的主要原因：為卵巢機能受月經不調，白帶不感，營養不良，多產虧弱，貧血虛勞等症所侵害，以致影饗新陳代謝作用所致。故此時若以行銷最久，成分最佳的卵巢內分泌製劑女用『生殖素』服之。自能於短期內治愈上述各症，而使乳峯高聳，臀部豐腴，肌肉豐潤，若繼續服用，更可調經種子，強身駐顏，增進夫婦間的愛情，造成快樂永恒的美滿家庭，而幸福無窮。</p>

<p>工部局捕房某高級職員談、工部局為防止暴徒再行不法襲擊租界巡捕起見、滬西一帶防務、業已加強、此項聲明、實係駁斥「新申報」之荒謬記載、按昨日該報載稱、工部局在滬西越界築路之交通巡捕、業已撒退、乃係租界當局將該區警權交出之第一步云云、據稱、「該區交通巡捕、雖有一部份離去原有崗位、但均巳加入巡邏隊、以增強警力、蓋越界築路在過去一周中、曾有巡捕七名、三次被武裝暴徒奪去槍械、此等暴徒、於棄得槍械後、均向偽「市政府」區域中潛逸、第一决事件係十五日晚、在極司非而路煙賭區域中發生、計有携毛瑟槍之便衣暴徒十五名、劫去華捕之手槍三技、當捕房正在調查此案時、十六日晚、又有華捕二名、在億定盤路白利南路附近、被暴徒奪去槍械、至二十日晚、復有印捕二名、遭受同樣襲擊、被携帶武器身衣中服之暴徒十二人包圍、刧去槍械、故工部局捕房探捕、非特不欲自西區越界築路撒退、且將由界內其他捕房、調用警員、繼續增強滬西防務、</p>
<p>雙方談判繼續進行</p>
<p>安林報云、官方對於西區整個問題、仍守緘默、惟記者昨日（二十日）確悉、工部局與上海「特別市府」對於滬西界外馬路區地們之談判、仍在進行中、討論之拖延性質、並不含已陷僵局之意、而領事團與上海各防軍亦牽涉於此項磋商中、按本月九日「市府」警察與日憲兵一隊、在極司斐爾路十三號相對愛文義路處架機關槍壘起、雙方即進行談判、</p>

<p>嗣後、靜安寺路上海格路與地豐路間、復架有沙袋堡壘、而沿西區一般馬路上、紛紛駐派哨位、警務處則依然巡邏於英義軍防區內之界外馬路、惟昨日續有更多之「市府警察「潛入租界馬路與附近、今該區持械警察之人數」、不能正確估計之、</p>

<p>靜安寺路一七六〇號上海商業儲蓄銀行職員宿舍、昨日偽驚無特殊行動、大西路王家弄（白宮殯儀館間壁）所駐守之偽警、仍未撒退、在七十二號對面之在家弄、昨日有偽警二人佈崗、哥倫比亞路口、昨日有偽警一人、指揮交通、惟捕房方面、仍派有華捕一人在旁監視、而對面馬路之人行道上、亦有二華捕駐守、法華橋東西端、仍有偽驚各二名擎槍守望、至安和寺路一帶、為偽驚調防之出入要道、蓋大部偽警、均駐在法華西鎮前正始中學舊址、故日憲兵偽警往來調防之卡車、日夜不絕、但無其他動作、</p>

<p>上海泰唔士報云、昨（二十日）據「上海市畏」傳筱菴聲稱、渠與駐滬法總領事鮑黛芝、巳就「互相有利害關係之各種問題」、進行非正式討論、渠並已與工部局總辦費利浦初步非正式討論公共租界界外馬路問題、但未商妥能據以解決問題之綜合方案、</p>
<p>稱法總領　表示合作</p>
<p>渠與鮑黛芝舉行之討論、難以說明正確範圍、但所涉及之問題頗廣、且談話係在極友好之氣氛中進行之、如認為必要、則將於認為適宜之時、復與館黛芝會談、鮑氏已表示眞正之合作精神與舉行友好的商權之準備、今為時過早、不能披露渠與鮑氏談判特二法院地位事、有何進展、惟渠對於進行「此等談判、堪可滿意」、頗為欣忭、</p>
<p>與費利浦　會談兩次</p>

<p>蘇州河北甲區　日軍今晨接防　恢復八一三戰前原狀　由匯山捕房行使警權</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>在「八一三」前、蘇州河北甲區（北江西路至北河南路間）原屬日本海軍陸戰隊防區、戰後由英軍接防、至本年六月、日方向英軍提出交涉、至九月十一日、雙方成立協定、規定自九月二十二日晨起、恢復戰前原狀、該區仍由日海陸隊擔任巡邏、現悉自昨晚起、駐防該區之英軍、已開始讓防、至執行警權之捕房、在戰前北河南路以西、由匯司捕房管轄、以東由匯山捕房管轄、惟自戰後、北江西路以東、則有鐵絲網切斷、與日軍防區隔絕、北江西路以西、至北河南路一段、改由匯司捕房管轄、茲因防區恢復原狀、該地警權、亦自今日起、仍歸由匯山捕房行使、</p>
<p>人心鎭定　並不遷居</p>
<p>蘇州河北英軍防區將有變史之說發生後、河北居民、聞訊遷居者、頗不乏人、茲以變更區域、祇限於北江西路伸展至北河南路一小段、住居於北河南路以西者、搬遷之風頓殺、即居住於伸展區域中者、以英日防區更變後、並不需通行證、且形式上亦無鐵絲網之攔架、故亦漸復趨鎮定、</p>
<p>昨日情形　一如往時</p>
<p>北江西路迤西至北河南路一帶、昨日悄形、一如往時、行人亦殊熙攘、北江西路海寗路交匯處之西、仍由英軍一名防守、北江西路靶子路口處、英軍駐防情形、與平日亦無異狀、北河南路靶子路口、亦有英軍一名駐守、該路通界路交通、亦照常通行無阻、</p>

<p>自本市鮮肉業與虹口「牲畜市塲」交涉吿一段落、肉業為顧全社會需要、暫行復業後、法租界宰作業聯誼會即刊登啟事、要求肉業於本月十四日起、恢復民國十八年所實行之落頭辦法、嗣經鮮肉業公會第二特區分辦事處於十三日登報拒絕要求、仍照向例辦理、中閒經過數度交涉、以雙方意見、相距過遠、並無結果、</p>
<p>肉業堅拒　落頭陋習</p>
<p>緣法租界鮮肉業送豬仔至宰豬塲屠殺、每隻取費以四角為標準、亦有以途遠關係、每隻取費四角五分至五角者、行之數年、相安無事、至所謂落頭辦法、則流弊滋多、如割取臟腑等零件、均為宰作業取得之利益、惟前數年猪價低落、割取內臟等數件、價值甚微、今猪價高昂、如以割取七件（即小腸拖梢護心油等）而論、則價值二元六角至三元、鮮猪業自不能承認此項落頭辦法、尚有死猪責任問題（即熬油猪問題）、亦為構成此决糾紛之主要原因、蓋鮮肉業送猪至宰猪塲、如該項猪仔留宰作塲一二日、因瘟而致死、此項損失、究應何方負擔、亦為雙方所力爭之焦點、</p>
<p>法方當局　調解未成</p>
<p>迨至十九二十兩日、法租界公董局鑒於情勢嚴重、遂召集雙方負責人至局、進行調解熬油猪問題、以雙方堅持、未有結果、宰作業方面復提出增加宰費問題、肉業曾表示最高可增至百分之五十、（即以每隻宰費四角增至六角）卒為宰作業堅拒、調解兩日、卒未獲得使雙方滿意之結果、至昨日報載「經公董局主任召集仲裁、公斷宰費增為一元五角、着於本月十八日成立協定」、等語、亦未成事實、但聞業已另訂折衷辦法、或可雙方接受、</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>昨閱貴刊所登介紹商務職工平糶法一文，敝會對於此種意見，尚有不能贊同之處，故特具函並附闡述平耀辦法流弊一稿，懇卽賜登貴刊，不勝威幸。　商務同人會（章）</p>
<p>因為近來孤島物價高速度的飛漲，各業都自動改良待遇，所以商務職工也為生活所迫，在上月要求發起津貼運動，歷盡波折，最近公司始頒佈所謂平糶辦法。（內容已見上期本刊）這個辦法，尚有未盡善處，爰分折如下；</p>
<p>（一）平糶辦法，計口授糧，鄉居眷屬，固無福享受，而子女超過二人叉屬無米可吃，且小同人薪給低微，眷屬大都無力在申，根本不能享受平糶之惠。</p>
<p>（二）低級薪水職員既多無力挈眷與俱，則單身在申，自只有吃包飯，試問公司所平糶之二十斤米如何處置，且較市價合來也僅可便宜一元七八角，事實上恐怕為了買這二十斤平米，時間和車錢上的損失，還不止此數哩！</p>
<p>（三）米蛀蟲是出名的吸血動物，公司平糶法給他們輾轉一過手，無論質與量都要打個折扣。（上次公司代同人購米，巳有此種現象，可為例證。）</p>
<p>（三）本來我們這次發起津貼運動，目的完全是為小同人着想，事實上薪金愈低，所受生活壓迫最苦，這决平糶辦法，對於大部份小同人仍無實際袖益，因此我們同人方面絕對不接受這平糶辦法，不過我們爲了愛護公司，諒解公司的困難，不願意使公司在這個非常時期裹再增加支出，因此我們心平氣和地向公司當局建議，提出了兩點意見：</p>
<p>一，以公司登報頂定每月萬元之平糶費，改為現金，津貼同人。</p>
<p>二，不以家屬多寡為標準，應以同人個人薪金為單位，薪金愈低，津貼應多，最高額不妨以公司所發表之十二元五角為度。</p>
<p>現在公司上海常局已接受了我們的兩點提議，正在向香港最高當局請示中，我們想這與公司預定支出，既無增多，而且減少許多平糶麻煩，我們相信王總經理一定是會照准的。那末我們二月來的天大風波就可這樣的平靜了。</p>

<p>— 自强</p>
<p>「冰」的市招還在炎熱的陽光下飄揚，「中秋月餅」已提早開爐，爲嫩秋的街頭增色了。摩登仕女的新裝跟着季節更換的時候，上海的各部門營業的相互競爭，也是非常敏感的。經過了酷熱的夏天，對於新秋的到來，每個人都感到一種異樣的快感：彷彿是離別已久的故人，也彷彿在期待中的情人。街頭展開了熱鬧的景象，人們的步伐是堅定的愉快。綢緞舖的櫃台前，擁塞着裁剪寒衣的男男女女，他們挑選着時令的花色，也計算着合家人口的支配。</p>
<p>中秋是新秋的一個佳節，也或許為了歡迎新秋的來臨，以這八月十五之夜訂下了團圓節的慣例。親友之間，就藉餽贈以增進情感，家庭之間，也略事舖張，以敘天倫之樂。在這些舖子裹徘徊的人們都充溢着歡樂的氣象。</p>
<p>「孤島」的新秋街頭，較諸往年，甚至戰前，誰見到絲亳的區別呢？</p>
<p>但是年年的明月夜，往事何堪憶？無家可歸的街頭露宿者，已抵不住午夜侵晨的寒露，他們開始感到住的威脅。望着迎風飄揚的市招，同樣泛起「一家都在寒風裹，九月衣裳未剪裁」的悲哀。</p>
<p>而這團圓佳節的駕臨，更使人添加無限惆悵！誰沒有歡樂的家，誰沒有甜蜜的回憶？而今呢，遙望家園，一片瓦礫；父母兄妹，流落何方？在這月明之夜，何以敘團圓之樂呢？</p>
<p>一月餅的廣吿接觸在人們的眼廉，玻璃窗內玲瓏的佈置，更誘惑着人們的涎滴，是中秋了，歡樂與悲涼的分野，雖然隔着一道明顯的鴻溝，但是眼前的景色，確使人懷疑自己的眼睛，—來往行人，笑顏相迎；各式市招，目迷五色，你想從什麼所在，去搜覓歡樂與悲涼的分野呢？</p>
<p>五天後的晚上，在皎潔的月光下，在輕微的寒風中，或許有人在低吟着「舉首望明月，低頭思故鄉」的詩句，那就是你所要搜覓的答案了。</p>

<p>第十六回　謀興醫學造士成庠　思擴村治託兒有所</p>
<p>但是她那裹的名氣，靑嬰院比婦孺醫院還要大。人家來徵求人材的，也很多是徵求育嬰院人材的，以為育嬰院裹的保姆，都是頂刮刮的。不然，這一胎三兒的小弟弟怎麽會保養得這樣好呢？因此老章醫師的崗位，現在至少有兩個。一個是培養產科兒科醫學人材的崗位，一個是培養育嬰院保姆人材的崗位。自然，她的崗位是擴大了，但她還是要守定這個崗位。她此刻的志望，想在安樂鎮設立一個醫學校；這個醫學校，是注重於產科兒科的。此外再設立一儸護士學校，這個學校，不用說，法重於育嬰院的保姆的，而且要提高到可以當幼稚園教師。的確，各處的產科兒科，感到缺乏，就是保姆們，也是求過於供，因為各地的託兒所，正在决第設立了。老章醫師雖然許了這個願心，但經費問題，還沒有着落。因此這回是轉到蘇理雅太太的念頭了。老實不客氣，不轉她的念頭則已，既轉到她的念頭，就非大大的打一個抽豐不可。老章醫師的意思，請蘇理雅太太帮忙，設法籌一筆基金出來。有了這一筆基金，就可以開辦了。這兩個學校，可以開在一處，好在就可以在那裹實習。人家來徵求人材，我們便可以舉薦她們到各地去，一年功夫，至少也可以培養成百餘人材。要是蘇理雅太太肯獨力支持這培養人材的學校時，我們便取名這學校為蘇理雅學校，以為蘇理雅先生留一紀念。這件事，雖然老章醫師與蘇理雅太太有這個交情，也全仗金澹雲從傍吹噓，打一陣邊鼓。所以這回朱愛人到上海去，除了親謁蘇理雅太太以外，還要趁吃喜酒當兒，拜託這位新娘十，帮一個大忙。因為這是一件好事，內地缺乏那些人村，使一般平民，沉淪於疾病痛苦之中。而嬰兒因為保衛不得其法，死亡率的增高，尤其是可驚。希望金澹雲帮帮忙，明年生一個白白胖胖的兒子，就是報答你這個好心呀！因為余澹雲一向無求於蘇理雅太太，從來不曾向她開口過，請她帮什麼忙。現在金澹雲為了這件公益的事，向蘇理雅太太說句好話，蘇理雅太太一定是滿口應承的呢。　（一八四）</p>

<p>— 柳浪</p>
<p>在我們熱盼着虹口區開放的時候，蘇州路北岸的障礙物却由空氣的孕育，開始發展澎漲了。</p>
<p>我是帶了惋惜的心緒，踏上改觀前夜的蘇州河北岸。我也不知道自己是在巡禮？還是憑弔？</p>
<p>歷史的演變是殘酷的。蘇州河的北岸雖是那麼平凡，但昨日的蘇州河北岸，它在我眼前，忽而美麗起來，我對它燃起了戀戀不捨的情火。我想慰問它，可是從何慰問起呢？然而它留給我最後的印象，將永不能磨滅。</p>
<p>當我跨過染缸似的蘇州河時，心裹是異常的激動。</p>
<p>走到了北河南路底，我不忍細睹在眼底盡頭的景色，但，跟底的一幅破舊圖畫，還是要緊扣住人們的心靈，使你慘痛，使你憤恨。</p>
<p>就在那扇鐵門旁邊，我看見了年靑，瀟酒，整齊的蘇格蘭兵，從他的修麗的步伐上，我的心裹也曾揚起片片的感激，感激他們為蘇州河北岸盡了他們人生的義務，受盡了人為的風霜雨雪。</p>
<p>我悄悄地沿着老靶子路東行，用狐疑的眼光，望了一下福生路口鉛絲網裹的在修理的大廈。在前面，障礙物吿訴你非得在北江西路轉彎小可。</p>
<p>就從那個拐彎的地方起，我發見了這裹平添着的新的創傷。三角形的鉛絲網，緊密地圍住了北江西路東首的街面房子。</p>
<p>像是探監一樣，路人的友好在鉛絲網兩端相見了，不能親熱的在一起，祗能立在兩端談着話。圈外的人向圈內的店舖買東西，像是越獄犯一樣的畏縮。</p>
<p>文監師路和乍浦路，是面目全非了，我對站在邊緣的英軍，同對那憂思着的居民，一樣鈞起無限的依戀。</p>

<h3 id="c93">萬人爭看一紅珠！（上）　記千呼萬喚始出來的宋德珠 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 彤與予赤</p>
<p>昨天（十九日）下午，我到某兩個大學授課，回寒齋之後，看見案頭有兩張宋德珠和吳彥衡的名片，及一封北平靑年會周冠卿先生的介紹信，便知是他們來過，我恰巧出門去了。詢問過家人之後，並知道是由吳幻孫先生陪同來的。吳先生的國畫和劇學，都是我仰慕巳久，當時失去了一個立刻晤面的機會，覺得非常懊悔。</p>
<p>在南方的一般喜歡談論舊劇的朋友們，讀到了我這兩年來運續寫着的彤齊劇話，無不疑心我和德珠過去一定有着很深切的友誼。在北平的人們也是如此。例如最近出版的立言畫報四十九期，還有人做着文章說：：宋德珠這一决赴滬，有了彤齋予亦先生的事前宜傳，已經是得到了不戰而勝的地步了。事實上呢，我早經說過，我和德珠是從來沒有晤面過的；我也從來沒有替宋德珠或任何人做過宜傳。我平素就是一位態度拘謹，言語木訥的人，不但不會寫文章，並目不者於措辭說話。我在大學裹教書，同學們只知道柳先生寫的黑板筆記特別的多，却並不覺得他特別喜歡演講。這樣，我在今天（二十日）下午，在某處和吳先生及德珠，寶森，彥衡諸位會面握手的時候，我羞赧得說不出一句話呢？</p>
<p>然而我又何必說什麽話呢？一鳴驚人的德珠現在早巳成為一顆燦爛奪目的「紅珠」了。像我在上文裹所暗示的，我實際沒有一絲一毫的功勞。武旦一行的領袖在舊劇梨園界中本來是不世出得，往往十歲二十年得不到一兩位傑出的人材。照我所瞧到的，九陣風（已故），朱桂芳，邱富棠，方連元……，他們都是以武旦的技藝在這二十年來的紅氍毺上享盛名的，可惜現在已經像凋萎的花朵似的，謝影歌壇，不再能夠「搖蕩春風媚春日」了！近年呢？宋德珠，閣世善，朱盛富三人，都可算是武旦最新的人材。盛富是桂芳的姪兒世善是嵐秋（九陣風）的姪兒，兩人以前都曾經隨着別人的劇團到滬表演，獲到相當的好評。然而，事實上他們的藝術還不及宋德珠更為優越。德珠在北平戲曲學校「坐科」的時候，因着他的藝術的超妙，加以肯死下苦工七八年毫不間斷的勤習，和武旦宗匠九陣風，名教師諸如香，吳富琴諸人的循循善誘，已經成為徐凌霄先生所稱譽的四小名旦的翹楚，「唱做唸打」四者兼優的唯一名角了。張善琨親自編導之陳蕓裳第三部傑作「一夜皇后」中秋節滬光大劇院首映</p>

<p>— 病雞</p>
<p>做工與腰腿</p>
<p>做工包括表情步子水袖身段各項，鐵生演悲劇最對工，舉止安詳，儀容沈靜，動作趨於收斂，頗合靑衣格律；：步子穩練有加，惟缺乏娉婷婀娜風姿，啟步太快，未請老路步法，旗裝步法極好，此或係受瑤卿薰陶影響。水袖矜持太甚，過分穩重，致少輕俏曼妙動作，而未能達美觀境地，尚待進取。身段亦有同病，無自然姿態，臉上二目少變化，且缺乏內心表演，未能將戲情充分流露，致做工重頭戲，如「全部玉堂春乏嫖院逐王各節，演來鬆懈特甚，無精彩可言，此乃技術修養不足，台上經驗缺乏之故。腰腿雖為武旦刀馬旦必具工夫，靑衣花衫亦不可少，如「長板坡」圓塲，「御碑亭」之滑步，「刺湯」之屁股坐子，「百花亭」臥魚，「別姬」舞劍等，若無腰腿工夫，必難勝仟愉快。鐵生票友下海，腰腿未下苦工，「會審唱至大人哪時，例有坐子，鐵生以手撐地，身段非常生硬，顯見其腰腿工夫之幼稚，欲求精進，非痛下苦工不可。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>綜上所述，其藝術己可窺其大略，鐵生為靑衣正才，除嗓昔唱工外，皆未臻絕妙之境。惟處此鑒賞標準浮淺低俗之際，有幾人能深切體味規矩？正確之靑衣做工而發現其美，且靑衣多唱工戲，做工本屬决要，而同時做工又為最易令人欣賞之一環，蓋唱念二項，除一二甚淺顯之毛病外，普通人甚難辨其優劣，故普通人口中所說之「唱的好」，「唱的不好」，實即表情上貼合劇情與吾之代名詞耳。今鐵生既具佳嗓，倘能致力於表做，則紅通南北，並非難事。</p>

<p>— 靜遠</p>
<p>以好萊塢爲題材和背景爾攝製的影片，過去只有一張『芙蓉仙子』，現在讓我來介紹另外二張，一張已經攝製完成，還有一張正在籌備開拍中。</p>
<p>已經攝裂完成的影片是，Hollywood　Cavalvade，那是一張五彩鉅製，由唐阿曼契，愛麗絲費和林葩邋合演，阿爾喬生在本片中也客串一下，唱了一支名歌“KolNidre”。該片導演是歐文克敏，監製者則是鼎鼎大名的柴紐克。全片完全以最近三年來好萊塢的形形色色為背景，非常熱鬧。</p>
<p>另一張正在籌備開拍的是華納五彩鉅製「安琪兒城」（City　of　the　Angels），以八十年前洛杉磯好萊塢的種種事實為背景，很帶點傳奇色彩，主角由埃洛茀林，奧麗薇哈茀蘭和安秀蘭丹三位擔任，我們知道，洛杉磯在八十年前還是一塊荒涼的土地，居民大半是流氓和奸徒，現在以此為題材，當然是足以和「熱血男兒』一片相媲美的。</p>
<h3 id="c96">看態「日出」之後 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 乃唯</p>
<p>辣　劇場，繼「雷雨」後公演「日出」因為這部劇的演員，都是明星的原故，號召力相當驚人，前天我去看過。</p>
<p>角色的支配，實在比全盛時代的「中旅」，有過之無不及：陸露明德陳白露，服裝化妝都比唐若青好，態度也相當的不錯，只是發音很低微，這足以影響塲面上的空氣。因為蒙納的顧八奶奶的惡形惡狀表演逼眞，常常引起露明在台上忍俊微笑，這也是要不得的；周曼華的小東西，很有不少可愛的地方；白燕的翠喜，可就不行了，我一向認為翠喜是「日出」中最難描摹的一個角色，白燕因為爽辣不足，更欠老練，於是失去一切應有的精彩，語言不能乾脆俐落，也是不能討好的一大原因。男演員方面，當然以周起的王福升最引人入勝，可謂妙到毫顛；白雲飾張喬治，當然不如鄭重的熟練</p>
<p>鄭重以中旅舊人的資格來導演，雖然大體上還過得去，然而也不無小疵，譬如配音方面，在旅館一幕，只聽見打牌的聲音，而永遠沒有「洗牌」或「和牌」的聲音，似乎終不適當；妓院一幕的配音，在兩種不同的技術上，而發出同樣的聲浪來，這也是不能差強人意的地方；舒適的潘月亭，服裝方面，似欠富麗，另外如潘月亭在聽電話，顧八奶奶正和陳白露說話，因為這時顧八奶奶在「做戲」，引起台下的掌聲，而舒適竟不連貫的和電話對話，却等顧八奶奶話說完了之後，再繼續他的對白，這不但與理不合，而且有死要討好之嫌。</p>
<p>佈景燈光，都很不錯，可惜在第三幕最緊張的當兒，電燈暗了一次。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Germany and Soviet Union Divide Poland: Soviet Union Occupies Oil-Producing Center, Soviet Army Establishes Soviets in Occupied Areas, Four German Officers Fly to Moscow to Discuss Military Affairs <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Kovno: It is reported that Lviv, an important industrial city in southeastern Poland and a center for oil production, which both Germany and the Soviet Union sought to occupy, has now been assigned to the Soviet Union by a joint German-Soviet boundary commission. Other notable centers assigned to the Soviet Union include Vilnius, Grodno, Pinsk, and Brest-Litovsk. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland: A Zurich report has published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that, according to German official sources, German troops within Poland have reached a line from Sovami (north) to Stori (south), which has been recognized by the Soviet government. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources in Berlin, negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union regarding the division of occupied territories in Poland are still ongoing in Berlin, and a satisfactory resolution is far from reached. Furthermore, if the Romanian government allows key figures of the Polish government who have fled to Romania to pass onward, Germany intends to protest to Romania. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland: The German Labor Newspaper recently reported that German troops on the eastern front in Poland have reached the boundary agreed upon by the German and Soviet governments. The newspaper did not specify whether this boundary was agreed upon by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop during his previous visit to Moscow or whether it is based on the territory already occupied by Soviet troops. German officials have not made any statements regarding this matter, only stating that the German-Soviet boundary was defined by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1917. Well-informed sources here say that Soviet troops have already crossed this line by a considerable distance. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Cernăuți: According to information obtained here, the Red Army's forces entering Poland number 110 divisions, and they are currently organizing a Soviet government, using Ukrainian farmers as local committees and secretariats. The Polish border has been closed. Czerlejczyki held a meeting to establish border regions but reached no decision. Several thousand Soviet troops are stationed in Czerlejczyki. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Cernăuți, Romanian Border: Local administrative committees have been established in the areas of Poland occupied by the Soviet army. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Four German military officers arrived here yesterday from East Prussia by plane to discuss with the Soviet General Staff various technical issues related to the interaction between German and Soviet troops in Poland. In addition, the German government recently dispatched Army Colonel Eggert to Moscow to assist General Köstring, the military attaché at the German embassy in the Soviet Union. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to the German official news agency, German troops met with advancing Soviet troops today. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Cernăuți, Romania: According to reliable sources, Soviet troops advancing into southern Poland reached the border town of Krynica (at the border between Poland and Hungary) last night, which originally belonged to the Carpathian Ruthenia province of Czechoslovakia. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Capital of Romania: Since the Soviet Red Army completely occupied the Polish border area adjacent to Romania, the general impression here is that Germany has allowed a certain force to penetrate Central Europe, which it cannot control and which is detrimental to its interests. German semi-official sources had previously expressed that it would be beneficial if Germany were directly connected to Romanian territory. This hope has now vanished. Furthermore, the Soviet Union has come into contact with the Carpathian Ukrainians in Hungary, and even the Slovak State and the German protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia are feeling the influence of the Soviet Union. Recently, residents in these areas have rebelled, which will undoubtedly be encouraged by the Soviet Union and suppressed severely by the German political police, further strengthening their determination to break away from German rule. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Cernăuți, Romania: After Soviet troops occupied the area bordering Poland and Romania, the military commanders of both sides had some contact. Then, they separately closed the border. A Havas correspondent who wanted to cross the border in Czerlejczyki (southern Poland) was stopped. Soviet representatives will discuss the opening of the border in the Romanian capital. Wherever Soviet troops arrived, they replaced Polish officials and formed Soviets, appointing Ukrainian and Little Russian peasants as committee members. Furthermore, the Romanian government recently issued a communique here, stating that Polish military and political personnel, as well as refugees with valid passports, are allowed to leave Romania by train or road. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris: Polish troops continued to resist German and Soviet forces in three locations yesterday, but neutral military observers believe that large-scale warfare will soon end. Polish troops are still holding Warsaw, Łódź, and Lublin. Only seventeen Polish divisions are fighting in these areas. German and Soviet troops have met at the border previously agreed upon by both parties. This line is similar to the one that former U.S. President Wilson attempted to recognize in the Treaty of Versailles. According to neutral sources, German troops withdrew from Białystok and Brest-Litovsk yesterday, allowing Soviet troops to occupy them. German and Soviet radio stations announced that the Red Army has occupied Lviv, a city that German forces had besieged for ten days without success. (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Moscow: Four German army and air force officers arrived here yesterday by plane to discuss the Polish issue with Soviet authorities. None of them hold a rank higher than colonel. It is reported that the Red Army has penetrated 125 miles into Poland, with its front line stretching from Lithuania in the north, through Lviv in the middle, to the Romanian border in the south, and continuing to advance. According to last night's Soviet official report, Russian cavalry and armored units have reached the outskirts of Lviv. It also stated that yesterday, the Red Army engaged in a fierce battle with Polish troops for two hours before entering Vilnius. In addition, the Red Army also occupied many towns and cities. (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that London is now watching the Soviet Union's reaction to Hitler's speech and whether a German-Soviet agreement on the status and borders of Poland can be established soon. Regarding Hitler's speech, the German-Soviet non-aggression pact does not seem to have any provisions for the collapse of Poland, but it largely recognizes the Soviet Union's claims to Belarus and part of Ukraine. However, Galicia and Lviv are likely not within the scope of this agreement. It is heard that German newspapers are visibly uneasy seeing the Soviet Union's general mobilization and its rapid advance along the Romanian border, intending to cut off the German route to the Balkans. At the same time, Hitler's speech did not reveal any German plans for the future of Poland. If a buffer state is established, Hitler will demand that the Soviet Union cede the Galician territories and incorporate them into Germany. Hitler will also try his best to avoid a common German-Soviet border, but it is said that the Soviet Union does not entirely agree with this. In summary, Hitler has at least abandoned his old attempt to invade Ukraine. The Soviet Union's diplomatic activities in the Balkans are particularly significant. The Turkish Foreign Minister is now travelling to Moscow to expand the Turkish-Soviet pact guaranteeing the inviolability of the Black Sea, and Soviet missions are also visiting Yugoslavia and Romania. There is much talk that Yugoslavia will sign a five-year non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. All these actions cannot be ignored by Germany. Hungary is also very disturbed to see the Soviet Union become its neighbor. However, the Gentlemen's Agreement between Greece and Italy, which stipulates the withdrawal of troops from the Albanian border, may stabilize the situation in Southeastern Europe. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e2">British and French Naval and Army Commanders Discuss Military Matters, British Troops Continuously Enter France, French and German Air Forces Clash Several Times <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Paris: Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier received British War Minister Hore-Belisha today and immediately convened a meeting with General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of National Defense; Vice Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy; General Colson, Chief of Staff of the Army; Trippe, Director of Diplomacy; and Kulund, Diplomatic Secretary of the Premier's Office. The details of the meeting are being kept strictly confidential by the government, but political figures generally feel a good impression and comment that Hitler's speech in Danzig yesterday, intended to alienate Britain and France, is best answered by today's meeting. The fact that Poland was defeated after hard fighting was originally expected by Britain and France. If the Soviet Union had not intervened, the Polish army could have held out for a longer time. How Germany will act after this is still undecided by Führer Hitler. Generally, if Germany adopts a defensive posture on the Western Front and advances towards the Balkans in the East, it will inevitably lead to entanglement with the Soviet Union. Conversely, if German troops launch an offensive on the Western Front, the Allied forces of Britain and France will stand ready and will not allow Germany to achieve its goals. Even if Germany attempts to violate Belgian neutrality to bypass the French Maginot Line or seeks to establish submarine bases in the Netherlands, Britain and France are well prepared, and Belgium and the Netherlands will defend themselves with all their strength. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris: British troops continue to enter France. Although the number cannot be disclosed, it is known that as a result of the joint efforts of the British and French navies and air forces, British troops are moving into France along a safe route that is guaranteed to be free from any attacks. The existence of this route also improves ordinary sea and air traffic between Britain and France. There is no news of major military activities here. It is reported that the French authorities are very pleased with the physical condition and training of the British troops and their suitability for the new war situation. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris: A communiqué from the French military headquarters stated that French and German fighter planes clashed several times in the skies over the Western Front yesterday. A German plane was shot down behind the French lines. The communiqué also stated that enemy artillery units were active at various points on the front. (Reuter, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris: Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier is scheduled to deliver a nationwide broadcast address at 8:30 PM tonight to report on the current situation. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 35, stating, "There was only local activity by forward units. Artillery units of both sides engaged in heavy shelling." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin: General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, arrived on the German Western Front yesterday to inspect several defense lines and discuss matters with local garrison staff. He then drove through the Saar region, where he was warmly welcomed by the people. (Haitong, 20th)</p>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 34, stating, "German artillery was very active at various points along the front. French and German fighter planes engaged in several air battles. A German aircraft was shot down in our lines." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>London: According to French sources, German artillery fire is not particularly remarkable. Although their aircraft are performing well, French aircraft can easily handle them. This is a period of tactical waiting. The French army is currently clearing the areas it has captured. The Want forest is full of landmines and traps. Seemingly harmless fences and other objects will explode upon slight contact. This is not only the case in the forest but also elsewhere. Therefore, the French army must conduct clearing operations in every area it occupies. According to French reports, Germany has assembled 1,500 aircraft behind the town of Aachen and has many workers rapidly strengthening the Siegfried Line along the Luxembourg border. Naval writers generally believe that Hitler had no more than fifty submarines capable of operating in the ocean at the start of the war. The number that have been sunk, as reported by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons, already accounts for a considerable proportion, and the losses of British ships are decreasing. The French also believe they have destroyed at least five German submarines. People generally speculate that Germany's future actions will involve using faster ships to attack British ships that are more strongly escorted than British convoy escorts. (Reuter, 21st)</p>

<p>Moscow: The General Staff of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army released the following war report for September 20th: On September 20th, Red Army units continued to press the Polish army, occupying the following locations by evening: On the northern front, the entire line of Western Belarus, occupying Grodno; on the southern front, the Western Ukraine front, occupying Kovel and Lviv. In the four days from September 17th to 20th, three Polish infantry divisions, two cavalry brigades, and countless smaller units were disarmed by the Red Army. According to incomplete statistics, over 60,000 Polish soldiers, officers, and non-commissioned officers have been captured. When the fortified areas of Vilnius, Baranovichi, Molodechno, and Sarny were occupied, all their military equipment and supplies were seized. The war booty that has been inventoried includes 280 cannons, 120 aircraft, and other war booty that is still being inventoried. (TASS, 21st)</p>

<p>Brussels: In view of repeated reports from British and French sources about German troops concentrating on the Belgian border, the Belgian News Agency issued a statement this afternoon to clarify the situation. It stated that foreign radio stations and newspapers are spreading rumors that foreign troops are concentrating in certain areas along the Belgian border, posing a danger to Belgium. We solemnly declare that, according to authoritative sources, the rumors are groundless. (Haitong, 21st)</p>

It is reported that Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov has notified the Estonian ambassador to the Soviet Union that the Soviet fleet will pursue Polish submarines that have escaped from Estonia. The Estonian fleet has also taken effective steps to search for escaped submarines. (Haitong, 20th)</p>

<p>Moscow: The Lithuanian envoy to the Soviet Union, Baltrusaitis, met with Deputy Foreign Affairs Commissar Potemkin yesterday to discuss the issue of Soviet troops occupying the city of Vilnius in northern Poland and reaching the Lithuanian border. According to well-informed sources here, Lithuania and the Soviet Union have always maintained good relations, so the conversation was very sincere. Although Germany had suggested to Lithuania that it send troops to occupy Vilnius as a way to recover lost territory (Vilnius originally belonged to Lithuania but was occupied by Polish troops in 1920), Envoy Baltrusaitis did not raise any request to reclaim the city. In short, Lithuania wishes to remain strictly neutral towards Germany, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France and will wait until the end of the war before making any demands. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Izvestia on the Polish Question: Soviet Military Action Not Contrary to Peaceful Policy <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Moscow: An Izvestia editorial stated, "The Red Army, under the orders of the Soviet government, crossed the border on September 17th to protect the lives and property of the people of Western Ukraine and Belarus. The collapse of Poland and its state apparatus is no accident. Poland, as a multi-ethnic state, has always lacked vitality and significance. Poles make up only 60 percent of its population, while minorities account for 40 percent, mainly Ukrainians and Belarusians. These two groups have a total population of 11 million. The Polish ruling class not only failed to establish normal relations with such a large number of minorities, granting them national rights, but also failed to meet the basic conditions for a multi-ethnic state to survive and thrive. On the contrary, the Polish gentry turned the country into a national prison, oppressing and exploiting minorities to the greatest extent, subjecting Ukrainians and Belarusians to particular insults and abuse. Western Ukraine and Western Belarus were effectively colonies of the Polish wealthy, a place for Polish landlords and merchants to plunder. The entire national policy of the Polish ruling class, in a nutshell, was armed suppression, forced assimilation into Polish culture, stirring up ethnic hatred, and white terror, which was no different from the Tsarist rule of Imperial Russia. Precisely for this reason, Poland could not unite internally, and its army, which included Poles, Ukrainians, and Belarusians, could not resist the German advance. After a military defeat, the Polish state immediately collapsed, with riots, disturbances, and anarchy occurring everywhere. Its army, abandoned by its commanders, also disintegrated. The Soviet people have unanimously declared their support for the government's national policy, with an enthusiasm that cannot be described in words. At the same time, the people of Western Ukraine and Belarus, now liberated from the shackles of the Polish gentry, are overjoyed from the bottom of their hearts, a joy that cannot be expressed in words. Since our Red Army entered, the working masses in both areas have welcomed us with all their heart, regarding us as liberating troops. Moving scenes can be seen everywhere. The liberated people of cities and villages are moved to tears, embracing our soldiers and commanders, giving them flowers, and feasting them with delicacies, rushing to comfort our troops. These liberated compatriots know that the Red Army is bringing them the gift of a new life of freedom and happiness. The measures taken by the Soviet government do not violate its peaceful policy. While protecting the people of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, the Soviet government, represented by Molotov, declared that 'all measures will be taken to save the Polish people from the war into which they have been led by their foolish leaders and to give them the opportunity to live peacefully.' The German-Soviet Communique of September 18th also reiterated this key point. Since the Red Army entered Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, the Soviet people have thoroughly demonstrated their patriotic sentiments. Throughout the country, millions of letters and telegrams have been published, unanimously expressing love for the socialist motherland, love for the government, love for the Party, and love for Comrade Stalin, a dear friend of all working people. Our government, having expressed the will of 170 million Soviet people, is unanimously supported by the people of the entire country, ready to thoroughly fulfill its duties to its blood brothers."

<h3 id="e10">Anglo-French Diplomatic Circles Observe: German-Soviet Friction Inevitable, Romania's Position a Key Factor <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>London: The diplomatic affairs columnist for the Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, recently wrote that the cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union is not very good and that friction is likely to occur. "When the two countries hastily agreed on the plan to divide Poland, they did not have time to formulate practical methods, and the situation changed rapidly at that time. The original plan was quickly put into practice, and they had to proceed in a competitive manner. So far, no major disputes have occurred between the two sides, but the signs of future disputes and perpetual suspicion have already appeared. It is possible that they will become acute even before the end of the war." In addition, the Soviet government has issued a warning to Estonia regarding the escape of a Polish submarine from Tallinn, Estonia. This could make the countries along the Baltic Sea feel uneasy. The agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union originally placed Lithuania within the German sphere of influence and Finland, Estonia, and Latvia within the Soviet sphere of influence. At this moment, the Soviet Union seems to be creating a pretext to take action against Estonia. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris: The relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union has recently been commented on by French newspapers. All agreed that the two countries may not cooperate fully, and the radical socialist newspaper l'Ordre takes the view that the Soviet Union should remain neutral. It is reported that "Britain and France no longer fear that the Soviet Union will seize Bessarabia (a province originally belonging to Russia, which was transferred to Romania after World War I) and believe that the Soviet Union will prevent German troops from invading Romania."

<h3 id="e11">European War: The European Countries <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>German leader Hitler gave a speech in Danzig on the 19th, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a speech in the Parliament on the 20th. Both speeches were published in yesterday's newspaper. Reviewing the speeches of both sides, there is absolutely no supplement or correction to the current state of the European situation, and there is nothing new to say, so we have no way to make any new evaluation. After the defeat of the Polish army, the Soviet Union sent troops, and the division of Poland by the Soviet Union and Germany is about to be completed. The theory of the European War and the object of the dispute have undergone factual changes; then the British and German authorities should make new suggestions in a timely manner; either the hostility will be even worse, or a sharp turn will happen, which is a matter of common sense, but it is not the case; this is for the sake of the world situation, and we cannot but be disappointed by the speeches of the two.</p>
<p>According to the speeches of the two, there is no reason to stop the state of war, and the inevitable continuation of the European War is its natural conclusion. With the fall of Poland, there is a view that the Eastern Front war will end; after that, the main war will be between the French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line. Generally speaking, in terms of the navy, Germany's strength is very different from that of Britain and France, and there is almost no main battle to speak of; the air force is far-reaching, and it should be used to create a new record in the history of war, but both sides are generally equal in strength and have their own concerns, then its initial use is probably only to echo the army and be active in the sky above the border between Germany and France. According to news last night, British troops who crossed the sea to the French front have arrived as scheduled because the stable and convenient communication line has been completed; the German commander and the army and air force have also been transferred from the Eastern Front to the Western Front; such deployments by both sides show where the focus of the European War will be in the future.</p>
<p>The victory or defeat of the war depends on the main force's engagement and the endurance of the economy. The European War is no exception; however, in the current stage of the European War, there is still something other than military and economic factors that can promote changes in the situation, that is, the joys and sorrows of European countries and the grievances and resentments of various ethnic groups. It is still far from the day when Britain, France, and Germany will determine the outcome with military and economic strength; and today, although all countries and ethnic groups on the surface only want to maintain neutrality, they are actually preparing to do something because neutrality is ultimately difficult to maintain; it is almost a matter of pointing fingers that they will take action from preparation. For example, the Soviet Union has already taken action in Poland, but claims to be neutral to Britain and Germany; given the special geographical situation of the Soviet Union, after it has gained something in Poland, it does have the possibility of strengthening its defenses and returning to neutrality; however, there have always been many disturbances in Central and Eastern Europe, such as differences in belief and national sentiment, which are enough to affect the Soviet Union, and how the Soviet Union thinks about Romania, the Baltic Sea, and even the Mediterranean Sea, it is impossible to guarantee that the Soviet Union will remain neutral in the end. For example, Italy and Spain, their conflicting interests with Germany are mainly on land, and their conflicting interests with Britain and France are mainly at sea; as the war drags on, Germany will threaten them, and Britain and France will lure them; the balance of interests is not easy to distinguish, and short-term and long-term considerations are different, but they must choose one of them. Countries such as Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia have already directly felt the threat of the disastrous defeat of Poland; they are concerned about their current safety and the future disasters, and it is not right to welcome or reject the Soviet Union and Germany. For all these countries, with the power of one country, all their actions and inclinations are not enough to determine the victory or defeat of the European War, but their impact on the development of the war situation is extremely profound; if they unite and collude with each other, whether they are jointly opposing Britain and France or jointly containing Germany, it will inevitably be an important factor in the final victory or defeat of both sides, which can be asserted. Therefore, today's Britain, France, and Germany must do their best to engage in military, economic, and national disputes, and what they are most eager to do is to maneuver between various countries. Moreover, it is not only the various countries, but also the Austrian race, the Czech race, the Jewish race, and even the Polish people, who have experienced the pain of national subjugation one after another, and their old and new hatreds are deep and painful; the closeness of these ethnic groups and the love and hatred of ideologies will be the basis for their actions, but the struggle for national survival must transcend the prejudices of emotion and belief. The governments of the belligerent countries can control the army and control materials. How can they make these depressed ethnic groups willingly accept bondage? Yesterday, it was reported that the old Czech state, the new German provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, and even western Slovakia, were determined to revolt, which was inevitable and not unexpected.</p>
<p>How the Western Front war will be is certainly not to be ignored; however, what deserves attention is the movements of the neutral countries in Europe. Military matters are difficult to resolve quickly, but international movements may change rapidly.</p>
<h3 id="e12">German Planes Fiercely Bombarded, Polish Troops Still Defended Warsaw; Germany Claims That the Polish Army in the South Has Surrendered; Polish Refugees Gathered on the Hungarian Border <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Warsaw. The Warsaw City Radio Station recently broadcast a message, stating that enemy planes had fiercely bombed the city today, and many women and children had been killed. The battle situation in the nearby town of Prague was quite fierce, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. Women in our country carried food to the front line to support the soldiers under the artillery fire, and their courage was admirable. In short, no matter how fierce the German army's offensive is, the Warsaw defenders will definitely resist resolutely. Colonel Li Bingsiji, the chief of staff of the defenders, also gave a radio speech, saying that the German army's repeated offensives had been repelled, because our army's morale was high, and its determination to coexist with the city was more important than tanks and kerosene. (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium. A reporter from the Belgian Free Press stationed in Poland recently sent a telegram from Serno City, Romania, to explain the current situation in Poland, stating that "the Polish army in the north firmly defended the line of Toruń, Płonsk, and Modlin, and still maintained a mutually supporting posture with the Warsaw defenders. The Polish army in Pomorskie Province in the west firmly defended the line of Łódź, Skierniewice, and Kutno-Łowicz districts, and repelled the German army in Kutno. General Brauchitsch, the commander-in-chief of the German army, has transferred reinforcements to reinforce them. In the south, between the Wieprz River and the San River, the German and Polish armies are still fighting fiercely. The land is a forest area, and the German army's tanks are ineffective. As for Lviv, the German army is attacking it from the west, and the Soviet army is attacking it from the east, but the Polish army is still defending it. In addition, the war situation at the border between Poland and the Soviet Union is also quite fierce. Because the Polish army's front line stretches for 1,400 kilometers and is not easy to defend, it has retreated from both the north and the south, thereby shortening the front line. The Soviet army was able to approach the borders of Romania and Lithuania. The length of the front line has now been reduced to 600 kilometers, and there are many swamps in the area, which is also very conducive to the defenders." (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>London. Warsaw Mayor Starzyński gave a radio speech last night, requesting assistance from Britain and France. Radio listeners here were able to hear the suffering of the Polish people. The mayor said, "Our city has been bombed miserably, and hundreds of churches and hospitals have been destroyed, and thousands of Polish women and children have also been killed. Therefore, I really need to appeal to Britain and France for assistance. I don't know when these two countries can provide effective assistance and rescue us from the depths of misery." The mayor had previously clearly told the Polish people, "We and your allied countries are now planning to continue our efforts in order to restore your freedom." (Associated Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin. According to official claims here, after a long period of resistance, the Polish troops south of Samoscz have surrendered to the German army, including two infantry divisions, one cavalry brigade, and one mechanized unit, totaling 11,000 officers and soldiers, along with General Pisto, the commander-in-chief of the Polish army in the south, who have all surrendered.

Since September 10, 60,000 prisoners have been captured in the northern region, and 22 heavy cannons and 108 light cannons have been seized. 350 officers and 1,200 prisoners and 40 cannons were captured near Gdynia. Currently, only isolated troops in Warsaw and Modlin are still resisting.

<p>Paris. Mayor Four of the Municipal Council recently sent a telegram to Warsaw Mayor of Poland, saying, "Your country's army bravely resisted and defended Warsaw, which is commendable. I deeply believe that although your country is now ravaged, it will eventually be restored. Long live Poland!" (Havas News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin. According to the official German News Agency, "The war on the Eastern Front has ended, and Germany's goals in Poland have been achieved. The Polish troops, who have been stubbornly resisting in the Vistula Sands for a week, have now been forced to surrender on the Bzura River. The German army has captured 105,000 prisoners, exceeding the Battle of Tannenberg, the largest war in world history. The German Eastern Army captured 92,000 prisoners between August 23 and August 31. The enemy's casualties totaled about 120,000. After destroying the enemy army, the German Eastern Army has now occupied the road money decided by the German and Russian governments. The Russian army occupies the Ukrainian and Belarusian regions, so that the German army can engage in other work." (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Kyoto Province, Netherlands. According to a message from Berlin, it is said that before the Polish army was defeated, it implemented a scorched earth policy, completely burning all kinds of food to prevent it from being used by the enemy, in order to cause famine in the occupied areas.

<p>Kyoto City, Hungary. Yesterday, another train of Polish refugees arrived at the border. The train driver had been killed on the way and was driven by the fireman. According to the refugees, the train they were on was bombed by German planes, and several refugees were injured as a result. In addition, many places along the way were also bombed, and many residents were killed and injured. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>London. The strong and unyielding defense of Warsaw has now won the admiration of the world. However, the rapid collapse of the Polish military organization has now been explained. The German army's departure from Slovakia, which caused Katowice and Krakow to be unable to hold out for a long time, was the most serious blow. The Poles themselves deeply regret that they failed to block the mountain pass of the Western Carpathians. I believe that the German army could not quickly penetrate deeply. When the people in Poland did not know that the war had already begun, German planes had already engaged in destroying Polish airfields and railway intersections and disrupting their transportation. After that, the planes surged like an electric current, and the mechanized troops advanced as fast as lightning, making it impossible for the Polish army to retreat in formation. This situation cannot be seen on the Western Front, because both sides on the Western Front have strong positions that make the opportunity equal. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e13">The German Army's Victory Was Determined in the Battle of Kutno; The German Army's Encirclement Strategy Was a Great Success; Warsaw No Longer Has Military Importance <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Rome. "Stefani News Agency" announced today that reporters from the German military authority received details about the Battle of Kutno and the siege of Warsaw. The Battle of Kutno was the largest battle in the German-Polish war. The elite Polish army fought fiercely and bravely there. The troops concentrated in Kutno had the task of preventing the German army from advancing as much as possible, so that the Polish Supreme Command could calmly assemble troops to defend the new defense line on the Vistula River. Therefore, the Polish army in Kutno had sufficient ammunition, artillery, and food. If these troops could not continue to support, they should gradually retreat towards Warsaw, where reinforcements could be added. However, the German army's encirclement strategy prevented this plan, which was jointly drafted by the French and Polish staff officers on September 4 and 5, from succeeding. The German army quickly entered the Kutno area and the Bzura River area, cutting off the Polish army's retreat route to the east. By the time the Polish Supreme Command began to understand the ultimate goal of the German army's feigned attacks in all directions, it was too late to withdraw the Polish army in the Kutno area. With the assistance of reconnaissance planes, the German army encircled the Polish army from all directions. The Polish army, regardless of the German army's artillery, machine guns, armored vehicles, and aerial bombardment, repeatedly tried to break through and retreat to Warsaw, but failed. The fierce fighting continued for a week, and the Polish army's resistance finally collapsed. Compared with the Battle of Tannenberg, in which the German army captured 30,000 enemy troops on the first day of victory, the Battle of Kutno captured 105,000 people on the first day, and the total number of captures is difficult to estimate. It is likely to be more than 200,000 people. The Polish army suffered heavy casualties, and it can be seen that the entire army was annihilated. It will take a week to sort out the spoils of war. The Polish army suffered a fatal blow in Kutno. The German army's success is due to traditional discipline, excellent organization, close cooperation of various arms, sufficient ammunition, and, importantly, the German soldiers' courage to sacrifice themselves, repeatedly resorting to bayonets and hand grenades to engage in fierce hand-to-hand combat. The infantry's achievements are great. The main force that encircled the Polish army was the infantry. The fastest attackers marched 60 miles in two days and were still able to fight bravely. Therefore, the Battle of Kutno is not only the largest battle in the German-Polish war, but also the largest battle of this century. Regarding the situation in Warsaw, a representative of the German High Command declared that valuable German soldiers and innocent Polish civilians should avoid unnecessary sacrifices as much as possible, because the occupation of Warsaw no longer has military and political importance. Therefore, it was decided to limit military operations in Warsaw and avoid unnecessary bloodshed. At present, Warsaw has been completely isolated. Regarding the situation in eastern Poland, the representative said that the border between Germany and the Soviet Union has been detailed by the governments of the two countries.

<p>London. As far as responsible people here know, Czech workers in Prague, Bohemia, a German protectorate, held an anti-German demonstration on the 16th of this month, which soon turned into a riot and clashed with German troops, exchanging fire and causing many casualties. The next day, the people of a certain place in Bohemia and Moravia provinces rose up in response, and by the 19th, it had spread to western Slovakia, where 15,000 troops mutinied and were disarmed by German troops. German authorities in various places have severely punished the rioters. So far, tens of thousands of people have been arrested and imprisoned, and more than a thousand have been executed, but the morale of the people is still extremely high, often fighting the German army with a small number against a large number. Those without firearms use various weapons. The wives and daughters of the workers in Prague even used nailed boards to beat the Germans. In addition, the Czechs have also carried out widespread sabotage in various places, and railways and highway bridges have been destroyed, and tracks, factories, and machines have also been destroyed. The material losses are very heavy. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>

<p>Washington. President Roosevelt invited Republican leaders to the White House on the evening of the 20th for a meeting. According to the communiqué, opinions on the congressional procedures regarding neutrality issues have been completely unified, and a party-wide meeting will be held to prepare for the opening of Congress. It has now been agreed to deal with the neutrality issue from the interests of the entire country rather than from the perspective of the political party. Congress will discuss the issue of whether to retain or abolish the arms embargo clause, and the issue of whether US legislation should be consistent with the legislation of other countries. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>New York. American automobile tycoon Ford said in Detroit today that he personally opposed amending the Neutrality Act, because the drafters of the Act knew the meaning of war, and the European war had nothing to do with the United States. The only people who wanted to amend the Neutrality Act were those who wanted to take advantage of it to manufacture arms on a large scale. Ford believes that the United States amending the Neutrality Act will not shorten the European war. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington. Sixteen national leaders met at the President's Residence at the White House at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (Eastern Standard Time) to discuss the issue of amending the Neutrality Act. Landon, the 1936 Republican presidential candidate, was also one of the attendees. During the White House meeting, 10 national leaders unanimously agreed on the principle of amending the Neutrality Act. After the meeting, a joint declaration was issued, stating that the United States must maintain peace and neutrality, and that Congress and the executive authorities have an understanding agreement regarding these actions. The President's administrative proposals will be handed over to the Foreign Relations Committee of Congress for discussion. Landon refused to express his opinion on amending the Neutrality Act, but according to his close associates, Landon supports repealing the cash-and-carry purchase of arms. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that he has convened a committee to meet on Friday to discuss President Roosevelt's administrative proposals. Isolationists in Congress are preparing to hold a small group meeting a few hours before Congress opens this morning to discuss coping strategies. Senator Nyeboara, a key member of the isolationists, will attend. Nyeboara said that if the majority of Congressmen support the President's proposals, the isolationists will adopt a moderate approach and propose an amendment, requiring countries that purchase arms to pay an additional 20% or 25% of the original price. When Landon arrived in Washington from Keizers yesterday, he told reporters that he could guarantee that the United States would not be dragged into the vortex of war. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Nomura Will Take Office as Japanese Foreign Minister <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo. Some newspapers here are rumored that Admiral Nomura, the principal of the aristocratic school and admiral of the navy, will take over as foreign minister after Abe. However, this statement has not yet been confirmed. The general public believes that the basic policy of the Japanese government towards Europe has already been decided and it is now preparing to take steps to formulate its policy towards countries outside Europe. Therefore, it is believed that the time for Nomura to become foreign minister has matured. Abe's concurrent position as foreign minister is due to the importance of Japan's European policy. For the sake of prudence, he is unwilling to entrust it to others. However, since Abe took office as foreign minister, the European situation has taken a turn for the worse, and affairs have been complicated. It is necessary to appoint a dedicated person to fill this position. Therefore, it is planned to look for capable people to succeed as foreign minister. According to the opinions of some newspapers, Admiral Nomura has special talents and is extremely suitable for this position, and Japanese observers also believe that Nomura is the most qualified person to handle diplomacy at a time when Japanese-American relations are becoming increasingly important. Nomura has visited the United States several times. Twenty years ago, he served as the naval attaché at the Japanese Embassy in the United States. From 1921 to 1922, he represented Japan at the Washington Conference. Nomura was also one of the Japanese representatives at the Paris Peace Conference after the European War. In addition, he has also served as the Deputy Chief of the Naval General Staff, the Commander of the Wu and Yokosuka Naval Ports. During the Battle of Shanghai in 1932, he served as the Commander of the Third Fleet, and was promoted to Admiral of the Navy in 1938. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<p>Washington - Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Kenkichi Horiuchi, stated to reporters today that the Japan-Soviet armistice agreement is unrelated to the European-American situation and does not signify the imminent signing of a Japan-Soviet non-aggression treaty. Japan and the Soviet Union signed an armistice agreement to seek a rapid resolution of the Sino-Japanese War. Horiuchi stated that in his recent conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Hull, he had established the basis for a new U.S.-Japan trade agreement. Horiuchi also said that Japan advised Britain and France to withdraw their troops from China, as Japan believed that the continued stationing of belligerent troops in China would cause various inconveniences or disputes. Japan has not offered this kind of "friendly advice" to the United States or Italy. (Dispatch from the United Press special correspondent, Gu Mu, dated 21st)</p>

<p>London - Naval Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons today the sinking of the British aircraft carrier Courageous by a German submarine. He warmly praised the bravery of the ship's officers and men and expressed the government's and the Admiralty's deep sympathy for the families of the deceased. Churchill stated that the Courageous carried 1,202 officers and men, which was slightly less than the full complement because the number of aircraft carried on board had been reduced. Captain Jones went down with the ship. Since the outbreak of the war, the ship had been protecting merchant shipping from submarine attacks and had achieved considerable success in attacking individual submarines. Its sinking is a significant loss. Opposition leader Alexander, on behalf of the entire House, endorsed the Naval Minister's expression of sympathy and praise. In response to questions, Churchill stated that the Courageous had a full escort of destroyers. The Admiralty had expressed clear views before the war on how Britain should deal with submarines, and he saw no reason to doubt the soundness of those views. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Chongqing - According to the Ta Kung Pao today, there has been fierce fighting in the northeastern corner of Hunan in the past three days, reaching its most intense stage yesterday. The Japanese army participating in the fighting consists of several divisions, with the aim of invading Changsha from Yuezhou. The focus of the fighting is currently along the Xinqiang River, 20 miles south of Yuezhou. Yesterday, from morning to noon, the Japanese artillery fired more than 4,000 shells at the Chinese army's positions. It is expected that the fighting there will remain in a stalemate north and south of the Xinqiang River for the next day or two. The Japanese offensive in northern Jiangxi is nothing more than a feint, and their real purpose is to invade Changsha. (United Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Miluo - The Japanese army in northern Hunan has resolutely attacked the north bank of the Xinqiang River, marking their first major offensive since the loss of Yuezhou last year. From the 18th to the 21st, Chinese and Japanese forces engaged in fierce fighting in the triangular area on the north bank for three days and three nights. According to statistics from a certain division commander at the front line, Japanese casualties were at least 3,000 or more. (Dispatch, 21st)</p>

(Dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Changsha - The Japanese army in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan launched a comprehensive disruptive attack on the Chinese army starting on the 17th. Battles occurred in Gaoan, Fengxin, and Wuning in northern Jiangxi, Tongcheng in southern Hubei, and on the north bank of Xinqiang in northern Hunan. The Chinese army near Gaoan is putting up a strong resistance to the Japanese army advancing westward. The Chinese army in southern Hubei recovered Tongcheng this morning, creating a gap in the overall Japanese position in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan. The Chinese army's vigorous resistance on the north bank of Xinqiang should give the Japanese troops supporting the westward advance in Gaoan a jolt. Overall, the Japanese army's actions in northern Jiangxi, southern Hubei, and northern Hunan in the past few days, while fierce, still amount to disruptive attacks, differing only in that they are slightly larger in scale than before.

In these eight years, our government and people in various places have never forgotten our compatriots in the Northeast for a single day, nor have they stopped thinking about recovering our Northeast territory. Therefore, there are armies resisting the war, the whole nation is united, victory is expected, and the recovery of lost land is within reach. Our compatriots in the Northeast have been longing for an army to avenge their shame for a long time. More and more young people are serving in the interior, and righteous armies are rising up behind enemy lines like swarms of bees. Today, Japan's vigor is waning, and its momentum is like the setting sun. The Chinese army is brave and its spirit runs through the Changhong. It is hoped that our compatriots in the four provinces will respond to the great cause of the national resistance war with a spirit of perseverance, unite internally and externally, annihilate the tyranny, and recover our lost land. On the day of the closing of the Fourth Session of this Council, which coincides with the anniversary of the September 18th Incident, we feel even more inspired when we look back on the past and look forward to the future. We hereby send a telegram of慰問 to encourage each other in the future. National People's Political Council. (Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Chongqing - Informed sources here publicly stated that "China is determined not to share its fate with any side in the European war, as China's only goal is to continue to resist Japan. China wishes to maintain friendly relations with all other countries except Japan. Therefore, it is completely wrong to think that China is only on friendly terms with Britain. In fact, government officials attach great importance to Sino-German relations. In the current situation, China's attitude towards the European war remains strictly neutral.

<p>Hong Kong - General Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army on the north bank of the Yangtze River, told visiting reporters this morning that the Japanese army is unlikely to launch a large-scale offensive into the interior of China and will instead consolidate the positions they have occupied. At the same time, the Japanese will attempt to use political means, such as establishing puppet governments, to bring the Sino-Japanese War to an early end. Developments in Europe have no impact on China's determination and strength to resist the war. Li also mentioned rumors of Soviet-Japanese negotiations, saying that if the Soviet Union and Japan conclude any agreement, it will not affect the Soviet Union's policy of providing material assistance to China. For its own interests, the Soviet Union will naturally help China resist the war. Even if the Soviet Union can no longer supply China with military supplies, or China can no longer purchase arms from overseas, China can still continue to resist the war and will not be seriously affected, as China currently has sufficient stockpiles of arms and ammunition and can manufacture small arms and ammunition itself. Japan's policy of using Chinese to control Chinese is bound to fail. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e38">American Reporter Visits Zhu Jiaji in Chongqing <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - A reporter from the New York Times recently visited Secretary-General Zhu Jiaji at the Central Party Headquarters and asked the following questions: (1) What is Japan's intention in sending Shigeru Nishio as Commander-in-Chief in China? (2) What are your views on the situation caused by the European war? Secretary-General Zhu answered as follows: (1) Japan's sending of Nishio as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in China is, in terms of its effect on China, the last resort of a spent arrow, an attempt to try again. However, the Japanese army has repeatedly tried and failed in the past, and will inevitably continue to sink into a quagmire from which it cannot extricate itself. Since Japan launched its war of aggression, its command has changed with the seasons, and its troops in China have been plagued by infighting and suspicion. This shows the increasing internal difficulties and the exposure of weaknesses. Nishio's arrival is intended to resolve these contradictions, but the Japanese military in China has long developed a situation in which the tail wags the dog, and Nishio can do nothing about it. On the contrary, it is expected that he will only make things more chaotic. (2) We are truly saddened by the outbreak of the European war. As President Chiang stated on August 29, only aggressors who deliberately destroy peace, such as the Japanese warlords, would hope for a world war. Now that hostilities have unfortunately broken out, we urgently hope that they will not spread and that a way to restore peace can be found as soon as possible, so that mankind will not suffer a more brutal catastrophe and will see light and peace again. People often think of the impact of the European war on the Far East, especially on the Sino-Japanese War. The impact cannot be said to be non-existent, but China will adhere to its established policy to adapt to the drastically changing international situation. What is this policy? It is to strengthen the resistance war to win victory and to unite with all friendly countries to destroy Japan's aggressive violence. As for the way out for human peace, Mr. Sun Yat-sen had already spoken of it with great concern. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen was engaged in the great industrial plan to develop China just after the end of the European War, when the countries engaged in the Great War were suffering from a lack of resources for reconstruction, he believed that only this plan could enrich the international peace advocated by President Wilson at the time and eliminate the causes of international war that would be recreated by countries following the old path of commercial warfare after the war. We adhere to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and never waver. Therefore, we sincerely welcome all our friendly countries to carry out economic and technical cooperation with China. However, this kind of cooperation must eliminate Japan's ambition to exclude the rights and interests of various countries in the Far East and to dominate East Asia before it can be realized. The factor of world peace is in China, and today it is clear. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan has always been a good solution to the cycle of wars and a major way to save the current European crisis. However, we must accelerate China's victory before we can seek peaceful construction. Therefore, helping China resist the war is also a major plan for world peace once and for all.

<p>Chongqing - The Shishi Xinbao editorial here today stated that it is a great mistake to think that Britain is the sole supporter of the Chinese legal tender in China. In fact, only the Soviet Union and the United States are the countries from which our foreign loans come. Moreover, from China's current standpoint, only the Soviet Union and the United States have a close relationship with China. Therefore, there is no possibility of China's economic collapse. Furthermore, China currently has enough arms stockpiled for two years. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Ta Kung Pao editorial today stated that the United States' concentration of its naval power in the Pacific Ocean is sufficient to indicate that the United States is a stabilizing force in the Far East. It is hoped that the United States will make good use of this power. The U.S.-Japan trade agreement should no longer be continued. The resolution proposed by Pittman to impose economic sanctions on Japan should be implemented quickly. If the United States were to stop all assistance to Japan, Japan's war against China would be impossible to continue. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Drainage Begins in Tianjin Japanese Concession <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Peiping - The authorities of the Japanese Concession in Tianjin began drainage work yesterday. The water depth within the Japanese Concession is four to six feet, and traffic in several places still relies on boats. Residents have been living on the second floor of their homes for almost a month. The Japanese have built dikes on three sides of the concession and installed four Lulis pumping machines on the dikes. Drainage work began last night. The dikes are 4,160 meters long and 4 meters wide, and their height is proportional to the depth of the water. The fourth side of the Japanese Concession was not flooded due to its higher terrain. The dike construction work began on September 1st and was only completed yesterday. Japanese engineers here claim that there are 900 million gallons of water in the Japanese Concession, which can be drained by the end of this month. The number of pumping machines will soon be increased to 100. Although the flooding in the British and French Concessions is lighter, drainage work also began yesterday. The authorities of the various concessions lack cooperation in flood prevention and relief work. Observers say that if all parties could work together, the number of dikes could be reduced by half. Engineers say that if the concessions carry out drainage work at the same time, the water in the Hai River will rise, further hindering the clearing work. The Japanese estimate that the Japanese Concession has suffered losses of over 400 million Japanese yen. Residents in the Japanese Concession mostly rely on charities and savings for a living, because all industries have been suspended. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>Chongqing - The rumors of Sino-Japanese peace negotiations circulating in Shanghai have been officially denied by the Chinese government here. According to Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui's statement to the Associated Press, these rumors are completely unfounded. China is not prepared to accept any peace proposals that are not based on fair terms. The so-called fair terms are the guarantee of China's integrity and the automatic cessation of aggression by Japan. Otherwise, we will continue to resist the war until a fair and lasting peace is realized. (Associated Press dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>London - British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered his third post-war speech on the war situation in the House of Commons today, stating that while Poland was fighting hard to resist the German army, an incident suddenly occurred on September 17 that had a decisive impact on the eastern front. On that evening, Soviet troops suddenly invaded the Polish border along the entire line. The Polish army, already under great pressure from resisting the German army, faced this new enemy, and the seriousness of the impact can be imagined. However, the Polish army continues to fight. What is the motive and consequence of the Soviet Union's action? It is not yet possible to draw a conclusion. Poland has unfortunately encountered this attack, and the result is the most terrible tragedy. The world watches with deep sympathy as the Polish people fight against the majority, and everyone admires their courage, because the Polish people still do not admit defeat. Although Britain and France have not been able to reverse the Polish army's defeat, they have guaranteed to Poland that Britain and France will never forget their obligations to Poland, nor will they weaken their determination to fight to the end.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Hitler's Hysterical Words <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister mentioned Hitler's speech, saying, "Our country is accustomed to not making boastful or intimidating remarks. This is probably why the German leader is not easy to understand us. Now, when I criticize Hitler's speech, I still do not deviate from our country's habit of speaking solemnly and leisurely. The words that Herr Hitler uttered in Danzig yesterday do not change the current situation, and the facts he stated cannot be considered accurate. His words contain a certain guarantee, but Hitler has wantonly destroyed this guarantee in recent years. There are still many promises in it. I cannot help but mention one thing, especially his statement that the French government has agreed to accept Italian mediation, while the British government has refused. In fact, the official communiqué issued by the Italian official news agency on September 4 has already responded to Hitler's statement, because this communiqué clearly announced the common attitude adopted by the British and French governments. Hitler also extravagantly talked about his humane methods of warfare. I cannot help but say that methods of warfare cannot become humane facts simply because they are given the beautiful name of humanity. The records of Germany bombing undefended cities and machine-gunning refugees have now shaken the world. The German young men who have perished in the war created by Hitler, or the women and children who have lost their parents because Hitler is determined to satisfy his hegemonic ambitions, Hitler did not mention a word of them in his speech. As for the purpose of Britain's warfare, it is to liberate Europe from the eternal terror of Germany's endless cycle of aggression, and to enable the people of Europe to maintain their independence and freedom. Britain holds this purpose, and so does France, and it will not change due to any threat. The British government is not seeking war and has repeatedly announced its readiness to engage in negotiations for a peaceful resolution. The documents that have already been published can be reviewed. Unfortunately, its efforts and hopes to achieve this goal were shattered by Germany's brutal invasion of Poland."</p>

<p>The Prime Minister said regarding the western front that the French army continued to make orderly progress, occupying destinations of strategic value, and holding the positions it occupied under the daily increasing resistance of the German army.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Resisting German Submarines <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister then spoke of resisting submarines, saying that in the half-month since the start of the war, resisting submarines has been effective, incomparable to the previous war. In the previous war, Britain focused on defense against submarines, while this time it is taking the offensive, currently searching for German submarines and attacking them. It is estimated that six or seven German submarines have been punished for attacking British ships. When the entire escort system is implemented and the number and effectiveness of aircraft searching for German submarines increase, the harm caused by German submarines will be quickly eliminated. We cannot honestly avoid occasional blows or encounters with major blows such as the loss of the Courageous. However, this is something that cannot be avoided in wartime. We now understand that the navy and merchant ships, with their continued efforts, are now able to maintain the necessary supply of military raw materials and food. During the previous European War, the average weekly loss of ships was thirty-nine, while in the first week of this war, seventeen ships were lost, and in the second week, thirteen ships were lost. A total of one hundred and thirty-nine British and neutral crew members died in submarine attacks, but the loss of the Courageous is not included. It is reported that a total of four hundred and twenty-four crew members of the Courageous are missing.</p>
<h3 id="e46">British Maritime Policy <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke of maritime policy, saying that the purpose of this policy is to destroy enemy warships, prevent their supply of military goods from overseas, and protect the trade of Britain and neutral countries. In wartime as in peacetime, the interests of neutral countries are also the interests of Britain, because the life of Britain depends on the uninterrupted flow of trade. Therefore, maintaining the usual state of trade to the extent possible is our basic policy. Although the interception of contraband cannot but cause inconvenience to neutral countries, our control measures are carried out entirely in accordance with established principles of international law. We will only exercise our right of inspection when there are good reasons to suspect that contraband is being transported to the enemy. Goods normally needed by neutral countries for their own consumption will not be interfered with in general. The application of the enemy contraband management mechanism and the public trial by the capture court in accordance with the law, and the central government's strict adherence to regulations, are quite different from the policies pursued by Germany. The exercise of its rights by our maritime power has never harmed lives, nor has it illegally detained the property of neutral countries. As for the methods of submarine warfare and laying mines used by Germany on the high seas, they kill many innocent people regardless of nationality and cause unwarranted destruction of the property of neutral countries.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Joint Anglo-French Operations <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke of the situation of the Anglo-French operations, saying that Britain and France are now making great preparations to build up our army and air force. However, one thing that must not be forgotten is that in various military preparations, the initial advantage lies with the aggressor. But our resources are now concentrated, and if the actual results are not immediately apparent, we must be patient and wait for them. The Prime Minister also reiterated the issues of the domestic home guard, civil defense, and the evacuation of residents, saying that the fact that Britain has not encountered an air raid in the first three weeks of the war is not a reason to relax domestic defense forces.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Dominion Mobilization <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Prime Minister spoke of the overseas Dominions, saying that the various self-governing governments are continuing to prepare so that they can actively participate in the great struggle at hand. The people of the Dominions have already expressed their eagerness to serve in the war that has now begun, and I think the members of Parliament will be greatly moved by this. At this time, the entire British Empire is actively mobilizing its full strength and gathering under our three armed forces of the sea, land, and air. The concentration of strength is stronger than ever before at the beginning of a war. The extent of our efforts is gradually expanding in all aspects. But today I want to issue a warning: the government is now working with military advisors in the closest contact and mutual trust. The government will not do anything that our military advisors disagree with. If our responsible advisors and our allied countries and ourselves believe that an action will make a substantial contribution to victory, then we will take any action, even if it involves sacrifices, we will not avoid it. However, we do not want to engage in risky and speculative actions that do not have a great hope of success, or that may damage our strength and delay the final victory. For lucky situations, the lessons given by military personnel are the way to disaster. I do not want to make any guesses at this time as to when or where the decisive military forces can be assembled, or when the decisive battle can be fought. In fact, such actions are unpredictable. However, the scope of our preparations means that all the preparations we have announced are based on at least three years of war. This ensures that our strength will continue to increase to cope with any future events. A famous Polish general recently said goodbye to the Anglo-French military mission, "We will fight, most of our land will be trampled by the enemy, and we will suffer terrible pain, but if you come to our aid, we are sure that we will be able to recover." This can also be the conclusion of my speech today. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Military Commission Announces War Situation on All Fronts in the Past Week, September 12th to 19th <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - A spokesman for the Military Commission said that the enemy on all fronts has gradually become more active this week than last week. Under our strong attacks, the enemy's attempts to invade have not succeeded. Now our loyal soldiers are fighting fiercely with the enemy on the northern and southern battlefields, and have achieved many victories. The course of the battle is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Jin-Sui Front: The war in Shanxi Province is going very smoothly. In southeastern Shanxi, we once recovered Huguan last week and cut off the enemy's communication between Changzi and Changzhi. At the weekend, the enemy gathered their defeated troops and launched a desperate counterattack, fighting fiercely with our army around Huguan and northeast of Changzi and southwest of Changzhi. At present, the three gates of Huguan, east, north, and south, are still being besieged by us. We have killed more than 800 enemies in the past few days. The enemy in Changzi and Changzhi are also exhausted. Another part of our army attacked the enemy on the Hongtun Avenue. On the 15th and 16th, we successively recovered the important towns of Hechuanfu and Fucheng, killing 400 to 500 enemies below the Miyata Brigade. The enemy in Fenyang, Fencheng, Jishan, Fenxi, and Xiaoyi in western Shanxi attacked westward in several directions, and were repeatedly severely damaged by us. The enemy commander Yamaguchi and other officers and soldiers were killed by us in large numbers, and they have retreated back to their original routes. In northern Shanxi, the enemy invaded Kelan and Wuzhai, and also had several fierce battles with our army, all of which were repelled. In the Wutai area, our army also killed many enemies. In the Sui area, after our army recovered Pingfanggou (west of Baotou) last week, they continued to attack Kundulun for several days, killing more than 800 enemies, and seizing 3 light machine guns and more than 500 rifles. The remaining enemies have collapsed and retreated to Baotou, and are unable to attack again.</p>
<p>Hunan-Jiangxi Front: The enemy in northern Hunan launched a large-scale invasion towards us by land and water this week. On the land route, under the cover of artillery fire on the evening of the 18th, they attacked Xinqianghe in two directions, one from Yueyang attacking Daqiaoling and Yao Haizhou, and the other from Taolin attacking Lijiawan. The momentum was very fierce. In order to lure the enemy deep into the position, we retreated slightly. Later, the officers and soldiers counterattacked in separate directions and fought bravely in hand-to-hand combat. By dawn on the 19th, the enemy could not support it and collapsed. All these areas were completely recovered. More than 2,000 enemy corpses were left behind. Another part of our army attacked the enemy's rear and once rushed into Yanglousi, capturing many enemies. More than a dozen enemy warships landed at Tuanhe and Xinhekou, but were met with a head-on blow, and the enemy did not succeed. They have now retreated back to the warships, and our army is still closely monitoring them. In Jiangxi Province, the enemy in Nanchang, Fengxin, and Anyi attacked Maqiu and Gaoan fiercely from the 15th. Our army resisted calmly and annihilated more than 1,000 enemies. The Maqiu position was lost and recovered. A heroic battle for Gaoan and the surrounding areas. Our surprise troops also raided the enemy's rear in separate directions, killing many enemies.</p>
<p>Henan-Hubei Front: In Henan Province, the war between our army and the enemy has been fierce this week. Our officers and soldiers have repeatedly frustrated the enemy's offensives and recovered many areas. Our army, which attacked the Qinchong and Qinbo highway areas in northern Henan, captured Wenxian and Chongyi on the 13th. At present, the two county towns of Qinyang and Boai have been completely controlled by us. Our army along the Taoqing line captured the strongholds of Wucheng, Beixiaocun, and Wuliyuan in the western section, and occupied Shangguancun southeast of □ County and Niushitun southwest of it in the eastern section, threatening the enemy's rear. Kaifeng in eastern Henan was once rushed into by us, burning the enemy's supply warehouses and automobile factories, and seizing many supplies. The county town of Lanfeng was also bravely captured by us at dawn on the 14th, killing many enemies. The enemy's Xu-Hai transportation was cut off, and the enemy trapped in Kaifeng was extremely shaken. North of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province, the war situation has been quiet this week. In southern Hubei, Tongshan County was captured three times on the 14th, and the strongholds of Shentang, Sishaxia Town, and Saigongqiao were captured on the 15th. The enemy fled in panic, and suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Guangdong Front: Conghua was recovered by us last week, and we took advantage of the victory to advance. By the 14th, the enemy transported more than 1,000 enemy corpses from Taipingchang to Guangzhou, including several senior enemy officers. In Huaxian, we once rushed into the city last week and cleared the remaining enemies in Jiekou and Aotou. We launched another attack on the county town on the 13th and immediately captured it. At present, the remaining enemies are entrenched in Longkou and dare not move rashly. In total, the enemy in this area escaped north this time, and were bravely repelled by our officers and soldiers. The extent of their losses is unprecedented since the enemy invaded the south. The enemy on the Hengmen sea repeatedly invaded Zhongshan, but were repelled. On the 14th, more than 1,000 enemies attacked Zhangjiabian fiercely, but were met with a head-on blow, killing more than 500 enemies and sinking more than a dozen speedboats. A part of the remaining enemies retreated to the warships, and a part collapsed and retreated to Shanzhou. At present, there are no traces of the enemy in Zhangjiabian. Our army raided Dalian on the evening of the 15th and fought fiercely with the enemy all night, killing many enemies. Dalian was once recovered on the evening of the 17th, and many victories were achieved.</p>
<p>In addition, Jibei Province captured Nanle and Xinhe, besieged Daping, Shandong Province recovered Tancheng, broke into Jiaoji Qianmingshui Station, and Lijiazhuang north of Linyi, and defeated 500 enemies in the Tai'an area. Northern Jiangsu captured Ganyu and forced the Xu County town. South of the Yangtze River, a large-scale defeat of the enemy invading Baishi and Baihu annihilated more than 400 enemies. In the Wujiang area, more than 300 enemies were killed. In western Zhejiang, a raid into Nanxun Town are all important victories in the past week. A supplementary report is attached here.

<h3 id="e57">The Ministry of Education Continues to Relieve Students from War Zones Arriving in Sichuan, and Distributes Them to Various Public and Private Middle Schools <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) Recently, the Ministry of Education, in view of the large number of university and middle school students continuing to arrive in Sichuan from various war zones, and the extremely miserable situation, has decided to find ways to provide relief. In addition to university students, who have been assigned to various specialized schools and seven schools, middle school students, in addition to national middle schools, have also been assigned to public and private schools. The distribution methods are recorded as follows: (1) All schools that have received war zone middle school students distributed by the Ministry of Education should try their best to accommodate them and should not make things difficult. Those who are unable to accommodate all of them in fact may report the situation of those who have not been accommodated to the Ministry and ask for other arrangements to be made. (2) When schools accept these students, they should order the students to present photos, certificates, or registration certificates, insert them into the appropriate grade, and may at any time assess their performance and assign them to a higher or lower grade. Those who cannot study with the class and have no grade to demote should also be given the opportunity to make up lessons. (3) When schools accept these students, the various fees that should be charged should be in accordance with the following regulations: A. Tuition, no charge for those who cannot afford it. Private schools may be ordered by the Ministry to subsidize half of their total tuition by the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education. B. Food expenses, half or full exemption for those from poor families, report to the Ministry for arrangements, and be borne by the public. C. Accommodation fees, no charge. D. Fees for books and supplies are borne entirely by the students themselves. (4) Schools should strictly conduct separate talks with students who request exemption from tuition and half or full food expenses, and examine their living conditions to make careful decisions. If there are any cases of abuse, after being found out, they should be ordered to pay the full amount. (5) If schools need to add equipment for classrooms and dormitories due to the accommodation of these students, they are allowed to report the facts to the Ministry, and the Ministry will order the Sichuan Provincial Department of Education to allocate funds.</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange Bulls Emerge in Large Numbers, Market Momentum Continues to Loosen, US Exchange Rate Already Exceeds Seven Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, HSBC's listed prices, all remained unchanged. The unofficial British-US exchange rate, due to the US exchange rate against the British pound, saw a rebound of 1.25 points. Therefore, the morning opening continued to show a trend of the British pound being stable and the US dollar loosening. The British gold rate remained at four pence and twenty-five, while the US dollar rate rose to six yuan and ninety-three seventy-five. After the opening, due to a sudden rumor from the previous evening that former Prime Minister Konoe had secretly flown to Haiphong and Hanoi, sellers flocked in, with Chinese merchants being particularly eager to sell. Consequently, the market momentum hardened, with the British pound reaching four pence and thirty-seven seventy-five, and the US dollar reaching seven yuan and eighteen seventy-five. Subsequently, due to the Bank of England, HSBC, and others strengthening their absorption capacity, and importers also coming to close out positions, the market slightly tightened. The British pound retreated to four pence and twenty-eight one two five, and the US dollar also retreated to seven yuan. In the afternoon, a ridiculous rumor suddenly spread in the market about the withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in North China, leading to even more talk of so-called peaceful atmosphere. As a result, bulls from Chinese banks, Chinese merchant securities firms, and others emerged in large numbers. Although the Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank came to absorb, the buying interest from foreign banks weakened, causing the situation to loosen and harden again. The closing price for the day was at the loosest price of four and a half pence and seven yuan forty sixty-two five. Futures for September and October also loosened accordingly. Trading throughout the day was fairly active.</p>
<p>Importers Still Closing Out Positions</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, London's major exchanges continued to rise by 0.0625 points for both near and far contracts. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London bullion remained fixed. The exchange rate for the British pound against the US dollar, Shanghai dollar, and French franc remained flat. The US dollar against the British pound rebounded by 1.25 points, was slightly up by five points against the Shanghai dollar, and remained unchanged against the French franc. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were four pence and twenty-five for the British pound and six yuan and ninety-three seventy-five for the US dollar, which was unchanged for the British pound and up by 0.0625 for the US dollar compared to the previous close, due to the rebound of the US dollar exchange rate against the British pound. After the opening, due to the rumor from the previous evening that former Prime Minister Konoe had flown from Hong Kong to Haiphong and Hanoi, Chinese merchants came to dump their holdings, and Chinese banks also released some. As a result, the market immediately loosened and hardened. Chinese merchants and Chinese banks successively sold spot British pounds to Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Dutch banks, and certain American banks, with the price hardening from four pence and thirty-one twenty-five to thirty-seven seventy-five, and spot US dollars rising from seven yuan to seven yuan and eighteen seventy-five. After HSBC's listed prices were announced to be unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be two and a half percent, certain banks absorbed October US dollars at seven yuan from Chinese banks. At that time, HSBC and Banque Franco-Chinoise's absorption capacity improved, and they bought spot British pounds at four pence and thirty-seven seventy-five from Chinese merchants. Subsequently, the selling pressure from Chinese merchants and others slightly subsided, and importers suddenly came to buy, causing the situation to soften slightly. Foreign firms closed out positions and bought spot British pounds at four pence and thirty-one twenty-five and twenty-eight one two five from HSBC, and also bought spot US dollars at seven yuan and six twenty-five and seven yuan from certain banks. Extending to the afternoon close, the bank's spot selling prices were four pence and thirty-one twenty-five for the British pound and seven yuan and six twenty-five for the US dollar. It was heard that the underlying trend after the close was hardening, with foreign firms mutually trading spot British pounds at four pence and thirty-seven seventy-five.</p>
<p>British Gold Reaches Four and a Half Pence</p>
<p>In the afternoon, around 1 p.m., a ridiculous rumor suddenly spread in the market about the withdrawal of Japanese troops stationed in North China. As a result, selling pressure intensified after the opening. Chinese banks, East Asia Bank, and Chinese merchant securities firms all competed to sell. Although the Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank took the opportunity to absorb at low prices, the buying interest from foreign banks was weak, causing the market momentum to be quite loose and excessive. Chinese merchants and Chinese banks successively sold spot British pounds to foreign firms Chase Bank, Banque Franco-Chinoise, and the Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank, with the price hardening to half a pence from four pence and thirty-seven seventy-five, and spot US dollars rising to forty-three seventy-five from twenty-one two five. Extending to the evening close, the bank's spot selling prices were four and a half pence for the British pound and seven yuan and forty sixty-two five for the US dollar. The prices for the current month were the same as the spot prices. October British gold was four pence and forty-five three one two five, and the US dollar was seven yuan and twenty-five. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot and current-month British pounds both loosened by twenty-five, and US dollars both hardened by fifty-three one two five. October British pounds were cheaper by twenty-three four three seven five, and US dollars rose by fifty-six two five.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Cash Falls Sharply with Foreign Exchange, Securities Firms Still Tend to Sell, Low Price Seen at Three Thousand Seven Hundred Yuan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Shanghai red cash unofficial market situation saw a strong decline, with prices retreating to the edge of the three thousand seven hundred yuan level. This was due to the increasing rumors of Sino-Japanese peace, claiming that former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe had flown to Haiphong and Hanoi, and that Japanese troops stationed in North China had withdrawn, and other kinds of absurd rumors enveloping the market. Furthermore, the central government had nationalized gold, repeatedly stating that it would be purchased by the four banks of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank. As a result, the morale of all parties became more and more depressed. Foreign exchange loosened sharply, and gold prices were even more sluggish and unable to rise. From the morning, it inherited the previous night's decline, and the market immediately fell to three thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan. However, due to the loosening of foreign exchange and the return to stability, and the Hakka merchants inclined to buy when they saw low prices, a wave of rising prices was triggered, and it briefly flew up to a high price of three thousand eight hundred and ninety yuan. Near noon, the atmosphere of peace suddenly thickened, and Hong Kong merchants suddenly came out to sell, and the market momentum turned weak. After the afternoon close, it had already fallen to below three thousand eight hundred yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread that Japan was withdrawing its troops stationed in North China, and that peace between China and Japan was being realized. In addition, foreign exchange loosened sharply, and securities firms tended to sell, which further fueled the already strong decline, and it actually plunged to a low price of three thousand seven hundred yuan. Finally, due to a lack of goods being released to cover positions, it pulled up to close at three thousand seven hundred and thirty yuan, a sharp drop of two hundred and fifty yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was about three thousand taels. Jewelry gold also fell to three hundred and seventy-five yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained flat across the board.</p>
<p>Shanghai Red Drops Two Hundred and Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the market showed a scattered image for each bar (ten taels). The general multi-neck panic rose again. In addition, foreign exchange hardened, and the intention to sell was even more urgent. The sellers shouted three thousand eight hundred yuan, but the buyers were still watching. It fell another fifty yuan, and money exchange businesses mutually traded ten taels for three thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan, a sharp drop of two hundred and thirty yuan compared to the previous night's close. Subsequently, the loosening of foreign exchange slowed down, and a certain silver shop and a certain money exchange business absorbed at low prices on behalf of the Shantou merchants. In addition, securities firms also had appetite, so the price suddenly rebounded by one hundred and ten yuan. A certain silver shop bought a total of thirty taels of spot cash from cash shops and peers for three thousand eight hundred and sixty yuan. After that, the silver shop's supply intention was more active, and foreign exchange continued to loosen, so it suddenly fell again, immediately dropping sixty yuan. Money exchange businesses mutually traded ten taels for three thousand eight hundred yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly came to absorb on behalf of speculators, and money exchange businesses also bought more and sold less. In addition, foreign exchange softened, and it suddenly rose again, soon soaring ninety yuan. The current life number bought ten taels from the money exchange business for three thousand eight hundred and ninety yuan. After eleven o'clock, the rumors rose again, and many scattered retail investors came to settle their positions. It was also heard that a certain money exchange business also sold on behalf of Hong Kong merchants, so the price became weak again. Before long, it fell seventy-five yuan, and the cash shop sold twenty taels to the money exchange business for three thousand eight hundred and fifteen yuan, making it the afternoon close price. The underlying trend after the closing was continuing to weaken, and the price broke through the three thousand eight hundred yuan level, with money exchange businesses mutually trading ten taels for three thousand seven hundred and eighty-five yuan, due to the hardening of foreign exchange after the close. In the afternoon, rumors in the market were even more prevalent, and it was heard that foreign exchange hardened. As a result, scattered retail investors all had the intention to sell, but at that time a certain money exchange business still had appetite, so the initial opening was only five yuan lower than the afternoon close price. Money exchange businesses mutually traded thirty taels at a price of three thousand seven hundred and eighty yuan. After the opening, securities firms also came to sell, and in addition, buyers were lacking, so it dropped forty yuan. Securities firms sold twenty taels to the money exchange business for three thousand seven hundred and forty yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop suddenly came to aggressively buy (it was said that it was absorbing on behalf of Hong Kong merchants) and immediately rebounded by fifty yuan. A certain gold shop bought ten taels from the money exchange business for three thousand seven hundred and ninety yuan. After that, the trade side's intention to buy turned weak, and in addition, securities firms rose up to sell again, and foreign exchange loosened sharply, so it fell sharply again by ninety yuan. Securities firms sold thirty taels to the money exchange business for three thousand seven hundred yuan. After entering, silver shops and money exchange businesses came to absorb in alliance, and the market momentum stabilized. Silver shops and money exchange businesses bought a total of fifty taels from a certain gold shop for three thousand seven hundred and thirty yuan as the evening close price. As a result, it plummeted by two hundred and fifty yuan compared to the previous day's evening close. It was heard that after the close, another securities firm in the market bought ten taels from a silver shop for three thousand seven hundred and thirty-five yuan. The fluctuation for the whole day was one hundred and ninety yuan. The cash shop's own brand gold was ten yuan higher than the Shanghai red, and the current bid gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Decreases by Another Fifteen Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold per tael decreased because a certain atmosphere rose up again yesterday evening, causing a sharp drop outside the Shanghai red market. Therefore, the listed price was reduced by ten yuan at 7 p.m., to three hundred and ninety yuan. Until noon today, it was lowered by another five yuan. At 2 p.m., it was lowered by five yuan, and at 4 p.m., it was lowered by another five yuan. As a result, it was lowered by a total of fifteen yuan on the day. It is estimated that Da Tonghang changed its version to three hundred and seventy-five yuan, and Xin Tonghang changed its version to three hundred and seventy-three yuan, with the purchase price reduced by about twenty yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Rumors Still Not Dispersed, Foreign Currency Downtrend Rises Again <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw constant loosening in the exchange market and strong price declines in the gold market, which further fueled the anxiety of those who stored it. However, the morning's rise and fall were still quite fleeting. US dollar notes initially traded at fourteen yuan and ten cents, then rose to fourteen yuan and fifty and a half cents. At noon, it retreated to fourteen yuan and thirty cents. In the afternoon, due to various rumors rising, the selling sentiment suddenly increased. As a result, US dollar notes retreated to thirteen yuan and sixty cents, a drop of nine and a half cents. British gold notes fell by two yuan and fifty cents, gold pounds fell by six yuan and fifty cents and seven yuan, Hong Kong notes fell by eighteen cents, Singapore notes and Dutch notes each fell by forty-five cents, rupee notes fell by fifteen cents, Canadian notes fell by seventy cents, Philippine notes fell by thirty cents, Italian notes fell by one cent, Japanese gold notes decreased by five li, and Korean notes remained unchanged. However, French franc notes still rose by one cent.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Discount Rate Falls and Then Recovers, Still Stands at Eighty Yuan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange bill discount rate once fell sharply, and then rebounded to flat. The initial rate was still eighty yuan per thousand yuan. The supply of cash exceeded demand, and it immediately fell to a low price of sixty-seven yuan and a half. In the afternoon, some people took the opportunity to buy cash at low prices, so it gradually rebounded, and finally returned to flat at eighty yuan, the same as the last price of the previous day. The money industry association's interbank lending rate rose by one point, with a listed rate of twenty-one cents, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Securities, Covering Shorts and Going Long Arise Simultaneously, Domestic Debt Rises Sharply by More Than Two Yuan, Class C Breaks Through the Seven Yuan Mark, Market Sentiment is Excited, Rare in Recent Months <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial securities market opened up by more than one yuan in the morning, and then rose sharply by more than one yuan in the afternoon. The public debt market suddenly became lively, with covering shorts and going long arising simultaneously. Class C bonds had broken through the seven yuan mark and were gradually moving forward, which was rarely seen in the past two months. In the past, the rumors that were often decided were extinguished in an instant, but this decision was not the case. The market's morale reversed the previous state of depression and gradually became excited. The prospects at the moment, with Class C bonds as the standard, the initial target is fifty yuan to fifty-five yuan, which is naturally expected. Yesterday's experience, the opening was good by more than one yuan, and the opening price of Class C bonds was forty-six yuan, and then one or two cents higher. Later, due to some bulls selling off, it fell slightly to five yuan and five cents, but it was still good by more than one yuan before noon. In the afternoon, good news continued to come, and the market price rebounded again, with Class C bonds reaching forty-seven yuan and five cents. The closing market was quite like a spring cloud suddenly unfolding. As for the lineups of the buying and selling parties, it seemed that the various groups had shifted their direction and focused on public debt because foreign exchange, Shanghai red, and spot goods had no possibility of going long. It is permissible to say that the investment of small financial enterprises was the most enthusiastic, because there was also talk of a large American loan at the same time, and it was not difficult to turn from theory into reality. The transaction volume yesterday was about three million yuan, and the prices all rose by two yuan, one and a half cents to two yuan and four and a half cents. Ninety-six also suddenly rose to six yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 100 shares of China Merchants Electric Power shares were traded, with a price of five yuan and three cents.</p>
<p>Also, the Public Industry Association reported that yesterday's market situation was firm, and the transaction volume was moderate. A new transaction began in the afternoon, and the trend was even more pronounced. Steel stocks were still in a good situation, and a high price of nine yuan and one and a half cents was once seen. At the close, buyers were at eight yuan and nine and a half cents. There was demand for the electric power company's preferred shares at a price of one hundred and twenty-four yuan and a half, but they were not easy to buy. Its bonds were very attainable at seventy-eight yuan and two and a half cents, and the interest earned by those who purchased at this price was equivalent to a little over seven percent, while the preferred shares were less than seven percent. According to actual circumstances, the bonds are securities for which the company has a preferential repayment obligation, and now, according to the actual situation, the profits they generate are actually better than stocks, which is truly an unthinkable matter.</p>
<p>London, 20th telegram: The listed prices of various Far East British company stocks today have not yet been fully opened, and the market is stable with no changes.</p>
<p>London, 20th telegram: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt today continued to open for a type of Sino-French US dollar (with seal), with a price of thirty-eight pounds, a decrease of four pounds compared to the end of last month. The remaining items, such as the rehabilitation Crisp British and French debts, etc., still opened at the original prices, and the rest had not yet been opened.</p>

<p>The yarn market continues to be sluggish, the situation is still weak, and the downtrend is slightly slow, but spot sales remain sluggish, the Hong Kong dollar's absorption capacity is also stagnant, morale is softening, and foreign exchange is lengthening, and gold is declining. There are few buyers, and the market is becoming more and more scattered and weak. The amount of absorption by the general strength is always unwilling to give up. It is said that they still do not lack absorption and increase their positions when they see low prices. There is also a saying that because it has fallen back more than 130 yuan from its peak, if there is no unexpected blow, it may be temporarily fixed.</p>
<p>The morning opening was not popular, there were more sellers in the market, and the single price of 20-count Double Horse old warehouse for the period was 700 yuan, which immediately dropped to 690 yuan. There were few spot transactions, and it fell by 20 yuan, to 740 yuan. Then, as gold fell, foreign exchange loosened, and morale was particularly weak, it fell another 10 yuan. The intermittent fluctuations have been going on for a long time. By the time of the close, it had risen by about 10 yuan again. According to the statistics of the half-day turnover, 955 bales were traded. The prices of 20-count Double Horse fell by 25 yuan, Tiannv fell by 13 yuan, and Shepherd fell by 7.5 yuan. Today, 20 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, 60 pieces were shipped to Saigon, and 60 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount of each gang's purchase is as follows:</p>
<p>White Cotton Trading is Lively</p>
<p>Spot cotton trading is still lively. The British firm Unified Chongxin Erchang bought 1,000 bales of white Luo cotton, and the price was very high. The business of white cotton continues to develop. These transactions are mostly purchased by cotton merchants first and then transferred to the factory. The source from northern Jiangsu has slightly decreased. 3,300 to 3,400 bales of Tong cotton have arrived at the wharf, and the opening price is similar to the previous day. 1,200 to 1,300 bales of Changyinsha cotton have also arrived, and 630 bales of Beisha cotton have arrived. The details of the spot cotton sales are listed below.</p>
<p>Another report is that the foreign cotton trading in Shanghai is due to the numerous rumors arising from all sides, and people's hearts are therefore unusually disturbed, and they all intend to temporarily hold a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, transactions from all parties are very few. Peers continue to be optimistic, so they are temporarily unwilling to sell. Yesterday, only Chongxin Factory purchased several hundred bales of White Luo cotton, and the factory price was 173 or 4 yuan per bundle.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices, The New York cotton market was firm at the beginning of the morning. Due to the purchase of speculators, the price of cotton rose by 5 or 6 pounds. Later, due to the strong sales of domestic cloth, the factory's demand for cotton turned active, and there has been a turnaround in Far East trade, and some shorts have been covered. All the way to the close, the price rose sharply by more than 10 pounds compared to the previous day. The price of Indian cotton has also rebounded, with both spot and futures rising by 4 rupees, Egyptian cotton rose by 6 or 7 pounds, and Liverpool rose by 3 pence.</p>

<p>Du rice and He rice arrived in Songjiang and Nangang in a total of fifteen ships. Cartwheel dumplings continued to arrive with more than 6,000 packages of new goods from Su Kun Jiaxing Jiashan and other places. Moreover, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the Hakka family is eager to sell their goods. At the same time, the sales market is exactly the opposite, so the market saw a downtrend at the opening of the early market. Afterwards, it fell more and more severely, and both japonica and indica rice fell by more than one yuan. It was at this time that the shops on the street were aroused, and the situation gradually became active, and the market turned stable. As a result, the price of special regular japonica rice was 39 yuan, special tin rice was 37 yuan, high quality was 35 or 6 yuan, medium quality was 33 yuan, Su Tong Kun japonica was 31 yuan, He Xia early and late rice was 29 yuan, original package was 32 or 3 yuan, Kun Zhuan Zhoupu new japonica was 26 or 7 yuan, Kunshan fragrant japonica was 38 yuan, Su Kun Jiaxing Jiashan new sheep pointed indica was 24 yuan to 22.5 yuan, Lingbai pointed indica was 25 yuan, Lu pointed indica was 23 yuan, Hu pointed indica was 21 yuan, Tuan pointed indica was 23.5 yuan to 23 yuan, Jiangbei new pointed indica was 23.5 yuan to 23 yuan, Wuhu high new pointed indica was 24 yuan, municipal was 23.5 yuan, secondary was 21 or 2 yuan, Bian yuan was 22 or 3 yuan, Hong Kong glutinous rice was 33 yuan, and the total transaction volume was more than 7,000 packages.</p>
<p>Ke Xian, The market opened softly yesterday morning, due to sufficient inventory and an endless supply. People's hearts have already been softened, and there were widespread rumors in the market that Japanese trading houses had dumped a large amount of new Wuhu Ke Xian rice, with prices only at twenty-one or two yuan. Therefore, people's hearts softened suddenly, and the market fell sharply. Traders and hoarders unanimously sought to sell, and although buyers had an appetite, they also intended to hold back and wait for a lower price. The price fell by two yuan, three, five cents to three yuan. Jiangbei new Xian high quality was twenty-three yuan and a half, medium quality was twenty-two or three yuan, Wuhu Xian ranged from twenty-four yuan to twenty-one yuan and a half. However, after the price fell, shop sales turned active, and the market turned stable again.</p>

<p>Flour, The flour market had been tired for days but slightly recovered yesterday. The factory price of No. 2 flour still stands at seven yuan in cash, and the Huilong goods have shown some improvement, because the customer routes are more active. Hong Kong, Xiamen, Singapore and other places continued to add to their purchases, and the removal of Tianjin gangs has also increased. Therefore, people's hearts are slightly better, and the market has a firm bearing. The old warehouse's single price opened at seven yuan a little, and the new warehouse's single price was comparable to the factory price. The total transaction volume was more than 30,000 packages. There was not much trading in Kaiyang flour, and the price was at seven yuan and six or seven cents, and the market price also lacked special features.</p>
<p>Wheat, Yesterday, the wheat market was particularly dull, and the supply was endless. Although the factory appetite was moving, it was not smooth, and the traders and hoarders had long been watching and not moving forward. Japanese firms also only had retail sales and slightly traded, and the buyers suppressed the price very severely, and the market lacked excitement. The total market only saw domestic households purchasing three carts of Guandian wheat, and the Fuxin factory imported 8,000 packages of Su, Xi, Kun, Chang, Zhen, and Yang wheat, and the price was lackluster.</p>

<p>Wenzhou charcoal has been out of stock for some time, and due to the thin inventory in this port, market prices have soared, forming a situation where there are prices but no market, and people are panicked. Street customers have the ability to absorb, and recently the Shenyou Wheel arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou, loaded with a large quantity of Wenzhou grade A charcoal, estimated at more than 4,000 dan, which was sold by the manager of the Gongji Charcoal Company. It is said that the internal price was only seven yuan and five cents per dan, and the commission rate required a two yuan market premium.</p>

The local No. 1 crystal was one yuan less, at sixty-five yuan, and the Jingming crystal was sixty-six yuan and a half. The Guotang's listed price was maintained and there was still no transaction, but since the foreign sugar has already fallen, although the national sugar has little inventory, there may be a possibility of loosening.</p>

<p>The crescent moon shines on the nine continents, some families are happy and some are sad. Some couples share the same bed, while others are scattered abroad.</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn Festival is a reunion festival. For lovers who are separated – especially women in their boudoirs – when the flowers are in full bloom and the moon is round, and the nights are beautiful, their hatred of separation will inevitably increase, and their feelings of "gazing at the moon and thinking secretly" will be greatly aroused! Therefore, husbands who have lovers often travel thousands of miles to be with them, so that they can pour out their accumulated feelings and spend this festive season together. This is also the duty of a husband to understand his wife's needs. In this way, won't the love and joy of continuing the relationship increase due to separation? Indeed, when men are healthy and women are beautiful, joy is born from separation. This is like a long drought meeting sweet rain, which not only benefits the body and mind, but also builds a solid foundation for the relationship between husband and wife. As a result, husband and wife follow each other, and they can't bear to be separated in the future. They give birth to sons and daughters and organize a happy family. How happy is that! But there are also many couples who are always together, and they should be reunited and happy. However, tragedies such as sleeping in the same bed with different dreams, being together in appearance but separated in heart, or even having affairs with others and eloping, or even openly suing the husband for divorce, constantly play out. Is this not a tragedy born of separation from union!</p>
<p>The joys and sorrows of couples are so changeable. According to medical theories, the key lies in whether the performance is healthy. If a man is full of energy and his desire for love is strong, who would be willing to leave his charming wife? Even if he is forced by the environment, he will always look for opportunities to reunite, especially during this festive season! Conversely, if a man has committed self-masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been indulging in sex early in marriage, and has exhausted the reproductive gland fluid that governs the health of his performance, then symptoms such as kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, premature aging, neurasthenia, and prolonged infertility will occur. This kind of sick husband, even if he has a beautiful wife like a flower, will inevitably show weakness and incompetence in his love life, or even be completely unable to perform. How can this not cause his wife to be annoyed, and the feelings become icy, and the cause of the couple's tragedy is mostly due to this.</p>
<p>If you know you are sick, men should make treatment plans early to avoid falling into a tragic fate! According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective treatment is to take the "Reproductive Gland Element" lysate, "Reproductin." This agent is copied from the reproductive glands extracted from strong animals such as apes, gorillas, and sea dogs using scientific methods, so it is of high quality and has great supplementing power. After taking it, it can produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish the nerves in one day and night. Continued use can also help development and adjust metabolism. It can definitely cure various symptoms radically in a short period of time. Regular use in autumn and winter can prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those who have nocturnal emission must also take "Hemet's Sperm-Solidifying Tablets" (available at Wing On Guangshi Pharmacy Department and Wuzhou Chinese and Western Pharmacies) to consolidate the sperm barrier and stop ulceration. Then, treating both the symptoms and the root cause will have a more rapid effect!</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Necessity of Prompt Treatment for Nocturnal Emission in Young Men <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nian-zeng</p>
<p>In today's society, characterized by licentiousness and a lack of sex education, the high number of young people who engage in masturbation and suffer from nocturnal emission is a serious hidden concern for the nation's health and future! According to an on-the-ground survey and statistics from a certain sexually transmitted disease expert, it is known that young people who develop the bad habit of masturbation during puberty account for more than 90 percent.  Among those who develop nocturnal emission after puberty, the number also accounts for more than 80 percent.</p>
<p>Why does nocturnal emission occur? According to medical analysis, it is mostly due to masturbation and indulgence, early marriage and licentiousness, which damage the sexual nerves and weaken the control function of the seminal vesicle. Thus, even when stimulated by sexual sensations, seminal fluid can be discharged. When the symptoms worsen, seminal fluid can be discharged even without sexual stimulation, which is what is known as spermatorrhea or seminal leakage.</p>
<p>Seminal fluid is the source of our life. In addition to its role in reproduction, it can also directly penetrate the bloodstream through glandular organs and circulate throughout the body. Its functions include promoting development, regulating metabolism, nourishing the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves, and increasing the body's resistance to disease. Therefore, those who suffer from nocturnal emission and delay treatment, resulting in seminal depletion and blood exhaustion, will successively experience symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, lower back pain, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging. Such young people, plagued by illness, will have their academic and professional prospects completely destroyed. Even the essential marital life will be devoid of happiness, and they may even die young! Nocturnal emission should be treated as early as possible, as we have repeatedly stated, because early treatment minimizes the loss of vital energy and makes it easier to cure. However, regardless of how recent or long-standing, mild or severe the nocturnal emission is, according to renowned Chinese and foreign doctors and my experience, taking "Hymetol Spermatonic Pills" is the most effective and targeted treatment. This medicine can strengthen the seminal vesicle, calm the nerves, and provide the real effects of inducing sleep and stopping nocturnal emission after taking it. If the aforementioned symptoms have already occurred due to nocturnal emission, it is necessary to also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Gonadotrophin" to fundamentally nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use can also promote development and regulate metabolism, inevitably curing all symptoms in a short period of time. Middle-aged and elderly people can also take it regularly to prolong life and rejuvenate.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhang Guangyuan suffered from nocturnal emission for several years, resulting in extreme deficiency. He could not think during the day and could not sleep at night. He had never had children after marriage, and the relationship with his wife was as cold as ice. During the summer vacation, he sought my diagnosis and treatment. In addition to instructing him to purchase "Hymetol Spermatonic Pills" and "Gonadotrophin" at the Wuzhou Pharmacy for both symptomatic and fundamental treatment, I also administered new methods such as electrotherapy and injections. After a month, he has recovered his energy and is enjoying health and happiness again!</p>

<h3 id="e73">From the Reunion of People and the Moon to the Importance of Breast Development! <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Doctor of Medicine Yao Chongpei, USA</p>
<p>Time flies, and it is once again the Mid-Autumn season with its refreshing autumn breeze and glistening dewdrops. Every time this season arrives, people, especially young and beauty-loving ladies, are all smiles and engage in major activities. This is because the heatwave has subsided and the severe cold has not yet arrived, making them feel relaxed and comfortable physically. And since the season is approaching Mid-Autumn, they eagerly purchase cosmetics, add new clothes, and put on heavy makeup to show off their slender figures in the clear autumn light. As for us men with beards, we naturally also need to buy some mooncakes, wine, and fruits to prepare for a family reunion with our wives and children in one room on Mid-Autumn Day, celebrating the "Reunion of People and the Moon."</p>
<p>"Reunion of People and the Moon"—what a happy environment! However, in this turbulent society, and especially in today's era where aesthetic values differ greatly from the past, many women, due to poor physical development, such as atrophied breasts, emaciated buttocks, withered muscles… are disliked or abandoned by men, and suffer the pain of the world! They are left alone in empty rooms, lonely on cold quilts. Although the festive season is upon them, it only serves to increase their pain. How can they find any joy? To seek remedy, they can only actively take the female "Gonadotrophin," a preparation made from ovarian extracts, which is the most accurate and reliable. The main cause of atrophied breasts is that ovarian function is impaired by menstrual irregularities, vaginal discharge, malnutrition, multiple births and weakness, anemia, and fatigue, which affects metabolism. Therefore, at this time, if they take the best-formulated ovarian endocrine preparation, female "Gonadotrophin," which has been sold for the longest time, they will be able to cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, making their breasts stand tall, their buttocks plump, and their muscles full and smooth. Continued use can also regulate menstruation, improve fertility, strengthen the body, preserve youth, enhance the love between husband and wife, create a happy and eternal beautiful family, and bring endless happiness.</p>

<h3 id="e74">The Situation in Western Shanghai Remains Serious. The Municipal Council Strengthens Police Force. The Rumor of Abandoning Police Power Is Completely Baseless. Negotiations Between Both Sides Continue. Fake Police Illegally Occupy Posts in the Caoyang Road Area Again Yesterday. <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department said that in order to prevent rioters from attacking the Concession police again, the Municipal Council has strengthened the defenses in the western Shanghai area. This statement is to refute the absurd report of the "Xin Shenbao." According to the report yesterday, the traffic police of the Municipal Council who were responsible for the roads built beyond the boundaries of the Concession in western Shanghai have been withdrawn, which is the first step of the Concession authorities to hand over the police power of the area. It is said that although some of the traffic police in the area have left their original posts, they have all joined the patrol team to strengthen the police force. In the past week, seven police officers have had their firearms seized by armed rioters three times in the roads built beyond the boundaries of the Concession. After obtaining the firearms, these rioters all escaped into the area controlled by the pseudo-"Municipal Government." The first incident occurred on the evening of the 15th in the smoking and gambling area of ​​the Great Western Road. There were 15 plainclothes rioters carrying Mauser guns, who robbed three handguns from the Chinese police. While the police department was investigating the case, on the evening of the 16th, two more Chinese police officers had their firearms seized by rioters near Yidingpan Road and Bailinan Road. On the evening of the 20th, two more Indian police officers were attacked in the same way. They were surrounded by 12 rioters carrying weapons and wearing Chinese clothing, who robbed their firearms. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department not only does not want to withdraw from the roads built beyond the boundaries of the Concession in the western district, but also intends to transfer police officers from other police stations within the boundary to continue strengthening the defenses in western Shanghai.</p>
<p>Negotiations Between Both Sides Continue</p>
<p>The Anlin News reported that the authorities are still silent on the entire issue of the western district. However, the reporter learned yesterday (the 20th) that the negotiations between the Municipal Council and the Shanghai "Special Municipal Government" on the roads beyond the boundaries of the Concession in western Shanghai are still in progress. The protracted nature of the discussions does not imply that it has reached a deadlock. The consular body and the various defense forces of Shanghai are also involved in these consultations. On the 9th of this month, the police of the "Municipal Government" and a team of Japanese military police set up machine gun nests at No. 13 Great Western Road, opposite Avenue Haig. Negotiations then began.</p>
<p>More Fake Police on Roads Beyond Boundaries. Fake Police Occupy Police Posts</p>
<p>Afterwards, sandbag bunkers were also set up between Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai Road, and Difeng Road. Along the general roads in the western district, sentry posts were stationed everywhere. The police department still patrols the roads beyond the boundaries within the British and Italian military defense zones. However, more and more "Municipal Government Police" infiltrated the Concession roads and their vicinity yesterday. "The number of armed police in the area" cannot be accurately estimated.</p>
<p>In the Caoyang Road and Wujiaochang area (that is, five locations including Great Western Road Bailinan Road, Robert Sun Road, Bailinan Road South Road, and Rear Road), the police posts stationed by the Concession police were all illegally occupied by fake police yesterday. For example: (1) in front of Dingshun Sauce Garden at the intersection of Great Western Road and Connaught Road, (2) in front of the Tiandetang Pharmacy at the intersection of Bailinan Road and Great Western Road, (3) in front of the Tianle Theater at the intersection of Robert Sun Road and Great Western Road, (4) in front of Dingsheng Rice Store on Bailinan Road South Road. The original police officers are still stationed nearby, and the number of people in each location has increased compared to before (ranging from four to six people). Armored vehicles from the police department are also patrolling back and forth, and the situation is tense.</p>
<p>Openly Armed, Patrolling Back and Forth</p>
<p>There is no major change in the fake police stationed at the 21st shelter of the Cilian Branch at No. 11 Great Western Road. However, the internal installation of water and electricity projects is being rushed, and they are very busy. The kitchen set up in the front has also been completed and has started cooking their own meals since yesterday. There are still two fake police stationed in front of the Yisheng Kangji Wood Shop next to Qiuyuan at No. 15. The defensive situation of the fake police at the intersection of Kangjiaqiao Jinjiaxiang and in front of the gate of the fake police sub-bureau on Malu Bridge is still the same as before. However, since yesterday, armed fake police have been riding in several military trucks, holding guns, and standing around the vehicles in a posture of aiming and shooting, patrolling back and forth. Passers-by were hesitant and looked sideways.</p>
<p>Yuyuan Road Has Changed Its Old Look</p>
<p>There is no change in the fake police stationed at the entrance of Qianjia Lane opposite Siming Villa, Zhongshi New Village, and Yuguang Village on Yuyuan Road, and at the gate of the Toyota Spinning Factory workers' dormitory at No. 1249. As for No. 909 Lizhao Fang (that is, the Xingye Bank Real Estate), after being occupied by Japanese and fake police at 10:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, four fake police were sent to guard it until 11:00 p.m. when they were withdrawn. Yesterday morning, fake police were sent to station there again. At about 2:00 p.m., the fake police were transferred to other places. At the corner of Difeng Road, six fake police suddenly set up posts in three groups at the intersection yesterday morning. The police department also sent six police officers to drive to the scene and stationed next to the fake police. It is found that Yuyuan Road from Haig Road to Zhaofeng Park is full of fake police, and it no longer looks like it did in the past.</p>
<p>Trucks for Troop Transfer Are Non-Stop Day and Night</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no special actions by the fake police at the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank staff dormitory at No. 1760 Jing'an Temple Road. The fake police stationed in Wangjia Lane (next to the White House Funeral Home) on the Great West Road have not been withdrawn. Yesterday, two fake police officers were stationed at Zaizha Lane, opposite No. 72. Yesterday, one fake police officer was directing traffic at the Columbia Road intersection. However, the police department still sent one Chinese police officer to monitor nearby, and there were also two Chinese police officers stationed on the sidewalk on the opposite side of the road. There are still two fake police officers carrying guns guarding the east and west ends of Fahua Bridge. As for the Anhe Temple Road area, it is an important road for the fake police to transfer troops. Most of the fake police are stationed at the old site of the Qianzhengshi Middle School in Fahua West Town. Therefore, the trucks of Japanese military police and fake police transferring troops back and forth are non-stop day and night, but there are no other actions.</p>
<p>Border Area Precautions Were Stricter Yesterday</p>
<p>The situation of the fake police stationed at Lin's Mansion, No. 448 Haig Road, is the same as the day before yesterday. However, when the reporter went to inspect yesterday, he saw women and children entering and leaving frequently, or they were family members of the fake police. Yesterday, at the Yidingpan Road intersection, six fake police officers, two in a row, formed a triangular station in the center of the road and at the corner. Both Concession police departments sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, totaling more than 20 people, to defend the area, and there was one armored vehicle aimed at the fake police station, checking pedestrians and vehicles very closely, and the situation was very serious. The number of police officers at the intersection of Xujiahui Xihui Road was also increased yesterday, and the situation was still good.</p>
<p>The Authorities Have Not Abandoned Police Power</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Fang Daily newspaper reported that since the morning of the 20th, the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station had automatically withdrawn the police posts from eight locations: (1) Great West Road Columbia Road, (2) Kaina Road Great Western Road, (3) Kaina Road Yidingpan Road, (4) Yidingpan Road Bailinan Road, (5) Caoyang Road, commonly known as Wujiaochang, (6) Great Western Road Bailinan Road, (7) Great Western Road Robert Sun Road, (8) Great Western Road Connaught Road. However, according to the reporter's knowledge, the Municipal Council has not only not abandoned the exercise of police power in the above-mentioned locations, but also sent more Chinese and Western detectives to each location to strengthen the police force and monitor the actions of the fake police. However, in order to ease the situation due to the police power issue being under negotiation, no armed intervention has been taken against the actions of the fake police supported by the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Various Things Said by the Fake "Mayor"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (the 20th), the "Shanghai City Fear" Chuan Xiao'an claimed that he and the French Consul General in Shanghai, Baudoin, had conducted informal discussions on "various issues of mutual interest." He also had preliminary informal discussions with Philip, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, on the issue of the roads beyond the boundaries of the Public Concession, but no comprehensive plan was agreed upon to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Saying That the French Consul General Expressed Cooperation</p>
<p>The exact scope of his discussions with Baudoin is difficult to explain, but the issues involved are quite broad, and the talks were conducted in a very friendly atmosphere. If necessary, he will meet with Baudoin again when he deems it appropriate. Baudoin has expressed a genuine spirit of cooperation and a willingness to hold friendly discussions. It is too early to disclose any progress he and Baudoin have made in negotiating the status of the Special Second Court. However, he is quite pleased with the progress of "these negotiations."</p>
<p>Meeting with Philip Twice</p>
<p>So far, the two discussions with Philip, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, have been of an informal nature. Neither side has put forward concrete proposals to solve the problem of the roads beyond the boundaries of the Concession. It is only an informal exchange of views. Mr. Philip originally submitted the matter to the foreign consular authorities. The "Shanghai Municipal Government" will wait for a reply and then continue to discuss the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Rumors of Peace in Shanghai Are Not Credible. There Is Room for Negotiation Only After the Japanese Withdraw Their Troops First. The National Government Is Now Deploying Counter-Attacks on All Fronts. The Japanese Side Also Denies That Konoe Has Gone to Hanoi. <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the international situation has been unpredictable. Since Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a treaty of non-aggression, followed by the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement on the Mongolian border, rumors have sprung up in the market. It is known that most of these rumors cannot be proven. However, the result is only to give speculators an opportunity. For example, the saying that Soong Tzu-wen flew to the Soviet Union has been denied by the Chongqing side. Yesterday, it was also rumored that former Prime Minister Konoe of Japan had gone to the Southwest to seek peace between China and Japan with the Chongqing authorities. This saying is even more abrupt. The National Government insists on a long-term war of resistance. Peace can only be talked about if the Japanese withdraw their troops. Moreover, according to what has been heard from various sources, the Chinese government is now deploying counter-attack troops on all fronts. In the near future, the wars on all fronts will become more fierce.</p>
<p>Konoe Is in Japan, Not in Hanoi</p>
<p>Since this week, there have been many rumors about peace in the Far East. Some even said that former Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe has gone to Hanoi and is taking a route to Kunming to negotiate peace with the Chinese authorities. Last night, foreign reporters asked about this at the Japanese news briefing. The Japanese spokesman denied this firmly, saying that Konoe is now in Tokyo, and even if he is not in Tokyo, he is only in a certain place in Japan.</p>
<p>Military Personnel Advocate for a Five-Power Alliance</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reported that today (the 21st), according to unofficial Japanese sources in this port, yesterday (the 20th) it was rumored that the Japanese side was managing the Soviet-German-Italian-Japanese-Chinese five-power alliance. Although the Shanghai Japanese spokesman expressed some doubts last night, today, the military personnel in Tokyo who advocate this alliance believe that the plan to realize a radical change in policy has gained momentum. Unofficial Japanese sources in this port insisted that the movement for a five-power alliance has begun, and it is pointed out that Admiral Nomura, who served as the commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy during the Shanghai War in 1932, is the most likely to succeed Abe as the Foreign Minister, who is also the Prime Minister of Japan. When the proposed five-power alliance is implemented, the Japanese Navy will occupy an important position. Excluding British and French forces from the Far East will mostly depend on the actions of the Japanese Navy.</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesman Expressed Doubt</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that at the Japanese reception for news reporters last night (the 20th), the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy's reaction to the English-language Great American Evening News' yesterday's publication of "The influential Japanese political circles are now actively managing the Soviet-German-Italian-Japanese-Chinese five-power alliance in order to exclude the British from the East" was "completely baffled." After reading the message, the spokesman said that he himself was confused and quite doubted the correctness of the "unofficial Japanese sources in this port." Even in Japan, opinions are not all the same. Therefore, one person's remarks cannot represent the opinions of the entire Japanese people.</p>
<p>Japan Is Unwilling to Be Involved in the European War</p>
<p>As Japanese Prime Minister Konoe announced, Japan's policy is not to be involved in the European War. The Japanese government also adheres to this policy and is unlikely to take any steps contrary to this policy. The spokesman replied to an intermittent question, saying that the Japanese government does not want to establish any connection between the Chinese "incident" and the European War. Japan intends to concentrate its efforts to solve the China problem. However, this does not mean that it will establish any contact with other countries to make these efforts. Japan is determined to solve the China problem on its own.</p>

<p>The Japanese Army Took Over the Defense of the Jia District of Suzhou River This Morning, Restoring the Original Situation Before the August 13th Battle, and the Weihui Patrol Station Exercised Police Power</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Before "August 13th," the Jia District of Suzhou River (between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road) originally belonged to the Japanese Navy Marine Corps defense area. After the war, the British army took over the defense. By June of this year, the Japanese side proposed negotiations to the British army. On September 11, the two sides reached an agreement stipulating that from the morning of September 22, the original situation before the war would be restored. The area would still be patrolled by the Japanese Navy and Marine Corps. It is now learned that since last night, the British army stationed in the area has begun to transfer the defense. As for the patrol station that exercises police power, before the war, the area west of North Henan Road was under the jurisdiction of the Weisi patrol station, and the area east of North Henan Road was under the jurisdiction of the Weishan patrol station. However, since the war, the area east of North Jiangxi Road has been cut off by barbed wire and isolated from the Japanese military defense area. The section west of North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road has been changed to be under the jurisdiction of the Weisi patrol station. Now that the defense area has been restored to its original state, the police power of the area will also be exercised by the Weishan patrol station from today.</p>
<p>People Are Calm and Do Not Relocate</p>
<p>After the saying that the British army defense area in Suzhou River will have a historical change occurred, many residents in Hebei heard the news and relocated. Now, since the change of area is limited to a small section extending from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, the relocation trend among those living west of North Henan Road has stopped. Even those living in the extended area are gradually becoming calm because there is no need for a pass after the change of the British and Japanese defense areas, and there is no barbed wire in form.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation Was the Same as Usual</p>
<p>The situation in the area west of North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road yesterday was the same as usual, and pedestrians were also very busy. A British soldier was still guarding west of the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Hainin Road. The British military defense situation at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu Road was also no different from usual. A British soldier was also stationed at the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazilu Road. Traffic on that road to the Concession Road was also unobstructed as usual.</p>

<p>However, Yonglong Has Changed to Hong Kong, and Shenyou Is Still Docked at the Mouth of Oujiang River.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Oujiang line, which has been suspended for nearly half a year, was successfully tested by foreign merchant ships Xinxiangtai, Xin'antong, Xin'anli, Shenfu, and Shen'ai in early September. It is expected that each ship will be able to navigate temporarily afterwards. Therefore,</p>
<p>Yilong Company added Shenyou to the voyage, and Yonglong also planned to participate in the voyage. Unexpectedly, on the 16th, the Japanese side once again clamored that it would close the mouth of Wenzhou again from the 17th. After receiving the news, the shipping companies were extremely panic. Yonglong Lun</p>
<p>stopped opening Wenzhou and changed to Hong Kong. Xinxiangtai and Shenai have returned to Shanghai. It is heard that Shenai is temporarily out of service for repairs, and Xinxiangtai is still waiting to see. If the environment permits, it still plans to sail to Wenzhou. According to news from Yilong Company yesterday, for the Japanese side to close the mouth of the Oujiang River again,</p>
<p>There is still no definitive news. Shenfu of the company has started loading goods in the mouth, but Shenyou has not yet entered the mouth. It is still waiting for the opportunity to enter the mouth. Shenhua, which went to Sandu'ao, returned to Shanghai today from there. Shenguang went out yesterday afternoon and also sailed to Sandu'ao.</p>

<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reported that, according to the announcement posted at the temporary office of the Soviet Union's Shanghai Consulate on Shanzhong Road, the Consulate General will return to the old building on Huangpu Road next Monday. Four low-level officials of the Soviet Consulate left Shanghai for Vladivostok yesterday (the 20th).

<h3 id="e78">It Is Rumored That the Vietnamese Government Will Requisition the Haiphong Warehouse, and Will Be Able to Requisition the Goods Stacked in the Warehouse at Any Time. The Chinese Authorities in Haiphong Discussed Remedial Measures, and Quickly Telegrammed the National Government to Negotiate an Exemption. <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that, according to unconfirmed news in the shipping industry, foreign postal ship companies in this city recently received a telegram from Haiphong, saying that the Vietnamese government has issued a mobilization order due to the situation, in addition to mobilizing troops, digging trenches all over the important streets, and implementing lighting control at night. The government authorities will also requisition all official and private warehouses for storing military supplies. Therefore, the goods accumulated in the warehouses may be requisitioned at any time if necessary. Haiphong</p>
<p>The Chinese Consul</p>
<p>believed that this matter was of great importance, so he specially invited Huang Qiang, the Central Government's transportation commissioner stationed in Haiphong, and Xi Chunli, the president of the Haiphong Chamber of Commerce, and various large merchants to the consulate to discuss remedial measures for this issue, and urgently telegraphed the Central Government to request that our ambassador to France</p>
<p>earnestly negotiate</p>
<p>for an exemption in order to protect the people's strength. It is found that due to the failure of smooth transportation in Haiphong, the goods accumulated in the past year are about 40,000 tons, worth 100 million yuan in national currency. If it is requisitioned by France, not only will the economy of our merchants be on the verge of collapse, but also the national tax revenue and people's livelihood will be damaged. The general merchants are</p>
<p>extremely anxious.</p>
<p>However, the failure of smooth transportation in Haiphong did not start today. Therefore, merchants with a long-term vision have already found a way to take the route through Saigon. Since Saigon has no accumulated goods and there are many vehicles, ships arriving in Saigon can unload and load goods ashore without storing them in warehouses, so it can definitely avoid the danger of goods being requisitioned due to warehouse congestion.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Yesterday's Rice Price Fell Again, Fears of Instability Gradually Subsiding; Proposal to Reinstate the Rice Price Appraisal Committee <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The five flat rice distribution points in the British and French Concessions, as well as the first flat distribution point, were abolished yesterday and merged into the second flat distribution point at the corner of Avenue Haig and Route Cardinal. Therefore, the amount of rice distributed at that location was increased from 200 bags to 300 bags yesterday. 150 of these bags were transported to the third flat rice distribution point at the Jade Buddha Temple on Rue Lou-lan. The flat rice at both locations was sold out by 2 PM yesterday. According to inquiries by a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the regulations for the flat rice distribution at each location for today and tomorrow have been set as follows: (1) 250 bags per location on the 22nd; (2) 200 bags per location on the 23rd. The Sino-Italian Company's warehouse has been emptied. Starting yesterday, the tribute rice from the Fuxing Flour Mill warehouse on Yichang Road will be transported to the flat rice distribution points in preparation for distribution today.</p>
<p>According to news from the Rice Trade Association, the source of rice supply in the city has gradually become smoother recently, rice merchants have regained activity, and rice prices are expected to fall soon. According to an informal survey, there are currently at least 300,000 bags of rice in storage in the city. If the source of supply is unimpeded, it is possible to restore the situation from last spring. Recently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various rice shops have suggested to the authorities of the two concessions that they intend to request the reinstatement of the Rice Price Appraisal Committee and investigative work so that the food problem of the people can gradually return to normal. It is heard that the authorities of the two concessions are currently considering this.</p>
<p>Flat Rice Price</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited Zhang Nianxuan, Chairman of the Rice Trade Association, and Shi Hongxun, Director of the Second Flat Distribution Point, yesterday. According to both men, the five tribute rice flat distribution points in the two concessions have been operating for six days. Due to the "September 18th" anniversary, operations were suspended for one day during the period of alert, so in actuality it was only five days. Of the 8,000 bags of tribute rice, over 5,200 bags have already been sold, leaving over 2,700 bags of tribute rice, including 1,000 bags of flat rice. The first flat distribution has been decided to end on the 25th of this month. The agreed upon prices for the flat rice are: (1) $0.14 per Sheng; (2) $0.70 for five Sheng; (3) $1.40 per Dou. However, due to the hasty preparations for this decision on flat rice distribution, although strict arrangements were made at each location, the overcrowding of rice buyers resulted in civilians being knocked down. The second flat distribution must wait for a considerable amount of time before it can be decided.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Gradually Falling</p>
<p>The bean and rice market has recently seen rice from various producing areas such as Changshu, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou transported to Shanghai, which has made people less anxious. Furthermore, hoarders have disappeared, sales are sluggish, and prices for all goods on the market are declining. The market opened as usual at 9 AM yesterday, with an abundance of goods available. Prices fell again by two to three yuan compared to the previous day, and fears of instability are gradually subsiding. The reasons for this rice price decline are: (1) All large and small factories have participated in the joint group purchase of foreign rice; (2) Since the start of the five flat rice distribution points, civilians have been buying tribute rice at the flat distribution prices, and the business of various rice shops has become sluggish, with buyers in the market taking a wait-and-see approach; (3) The supply of domestic rice from various regions is increasing, and new rice will soon enter the market. As of yesterday, over 80 companies had registered for the joint group purchase of foreign rice, totaling over 14,000 bags of rice.</p>

The Hana轮 of the Far East Company sailed from Shanghai to Zhenhai at 5 PM yesterday. The Moufu轮 of the Lihe 洋行 will also sail to Zhenhai on a regular basis. The Haifu轮 will return to Shanghai after unloading its cargo in Zhenhai. In the future, the four German ships Feikang, Hana, Moufu, and Haifu will regularly sail the Shanghai-Zhenhai route. It is also learned that the Dapu轮 of the Norwegian merchant Hua Lun 洋行 will sail from Haiphong to Shanghai and also intends to join the sailing to Ningbo. Therefore, excluding the New Beijing, which has been reassigned to another route, there will be as many as twelve ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo route.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Fresh Meat Industry in the French Concession on the Verge of Closure Due to Breakdown in Negotiations Over Increased Slaughter Fees; Meat Trade Association Issued Notice Yesterday to Suspend Purchases <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Since the negotiations between the fresh meat industry in the city and the Hongkou "Livestock Market" came to a temporary end, and the meat industry resumed operations to safeguard social needs, the Slaughter Industry Association of the French Concession published a notice requesting the meat industry to resume the "cut-head" method implemented in 1929, starting from the 14th of this month. Subsequently, the Second Special District Branch of the Fresh Meat Trade Association published a newspaper on the 13th rejecting the request and continuing to operate as usual. After several rounds of negotiations, the opinions of both parties were too far apart, and there was no result.</p>
<p>The Meat Industry Firmly Rejects the "Cut-Head" Bad Habit</p>
<p>The practice of the fresh meat industry in the French Concession sending piglets to the slaughterhouse for slaughter, with a fee of $0.40 per pig as the standard, or $0.45 to $0.50 per pig due to distance, has been in place for many years without incident. However, the so-called "cut-head" method has many drawbacks. For example, the profits from cutting out parts such as organs are obtained by the slaughter industry. However, in previous years, when pork prices were low, the value of cutting out several internal organs was very small. Now that pork prices are high, if seven pieces are cut out (i.e., small intestines, tail end, heart-protecting oil, etc.), the value is $2.60 to $3.00, so the fresh pork industry cannot accept this "cut-head" method. There is also the issue of responsibility for dead pigs (i.e., the problem of pigs rendered for oil), which is also the main reason for this dispute. If the fresh meat industry sends pigs to the slaughterhouse and the piglets die in the slaughterhouse after one or two days due to disease, who should bear the loss? This is also the focus of contention between the two parties.</p>
<p>The French Authorities' Mediation Fails</p>
<p>On the 19th and 20th, the French Municipal Council, seeing the seriousness of the situation, summoned the responsible persons from both sides to the bureau to mediate the problem of pigs rendered for oil. However, the two sides insisted on their positions, and there was no result. The slaughter industry then raised the issue of increasing slaughter fees. The meat industry stated that it could increase the fee by up to 50% (i.e., increasing the slaughter fee from $0.40 to $0.60 per pig), but this was firmly rejected by the slaughter industry. After two days of mediation, a result that satisfied both parties was not obtained. As for the report in yesterday's newspaper that "the director of the Municipal Council summoned the parties for arbitration and ruled that the slaughter fee be increased to $1.50, and that an agreement be established on the 18th of this month," this has also not materialized. However, it is heard that a compromise has been agreed upon, which may be acceptable to both parties.</p>
<p>Most of the Meat Industry Closed Today</p>
<p>Since the breakdown in negotiations, the slaughter industry has implemented the "cut-head" method for three days. On the first two days, seven pieces were cut out, and on the third day, eight pieces were cut out. Although the meat industry strictly negotiated to stop this, it was ineffective, resulting in significant losses for the meat industry. Since yesterday, most of the meat industry in the French Concession has stopped sending pigs to the slaughterhouse for slaughter. The supply of fresh meat in the French Concession market has fallen into a state of closure today.</p>
<p>Meat Industry Notice: Do Not Cause Trouble</p>
<p>The Fresh Meat Trade Association of the French Concession issued a notice yesterday, advising its members to wait quietly for a solution and avoid causing trouble. The notice is recorded below: "Notice: According to reports from members of this association, the slaughterers have been illegally occupying some of the organs that should be handed over, as a way to extort increased slaughter fees. This has been going on for two days. On-site obstruction was attempted, but there was fear of causing a fight. After reporting to the police, no legal action was taken. Members are suffering losses and have been forced to temporarily suspend purchases. Regarding the increase in slaughter fees, the slaughter fees in the French Concession are already higher than in the Public Concession. After the slaughterers privately seized some of the organs, and after repeated mediation by the police authorities, members have indicated that they can increase the slaughter fees by up to 50%. However, the slaughterers have been firm in their stance and have refused to compromise, resulting in a failure to resolve the issue. The initial intention of the members to settle the matter peacefully should be clear to the relevant authorities. Therefore, this association urgently notifies the members who have temporarily suspended purchases to strictly maintain order, wait quietly for a solution, and avoid causing trouble, so as not to affect public safety. This notice."</p>

<h3 id="e84">Mid-Autumn Festival Approaching, Various Industries Handling Account Settlements, Market Funds Abundant and Increasingly Active, but Speculative Transactions Becoming Increasingly Rampant <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Account settlements in Shanghai are traditionally divided into three festivals: the Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the end of the lunar year. As the Mid-Autumn Festival on September 27th is approaching, various businesses and companies have begun handling account settlements. For customer accounts that belong to Shanghai, lists have been distributed and personnel have been assigned to collect the debts. For accounts that belong to other cities, the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have issued certificates and assigned personnel to collect the debts. Therefore, the money industry's collection and payment have become busy, the amount of exchanges in the clearing house has increased sharply, and the amount of new exchange transfers used by various banks and businesses has also increased. The Silver and Money Trade Association has decided to take a one-day holiday for the Mid-Autumn Festival in accordance with regulations.</p>
<p>Abundant Funds, Stable Interest Rates</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new exchange transfer system in the Shanghai financial market, various banks and businesses have provided collateral and borrowed from the joint reserve of banks, which directly adjusts the bonuses of the silver and money industry and indirectly meets the needs of industry and commerce. In addition, the $12 million in exchange transfers deposited by various banks and businesses in the reserve treasury has been completely exchanged for legal tender by the central bank. Therefore, the market has increased exchange transfers and legal tender funds. At the same time, because funds that previously fled to Hong Kong have returned to Shanghai, the market funds are very abundant, and various industries are becoming increasingly active. The legitimate financial market remains stable, and the interbank lending rate has not fluctuated much.</p>
<p>Speculative Transactions Becoming Increasingly Rampant</p>
<p>After the fall of Shanghai, due to the lack of government authority, the general wealthy lack legitimate avenues for investment. Furthermore, the internal transfer of funds to develop the southwest cannot be fully utilized due to environmental factors. As a result, most of the funds are used for speculative activities, resulting in more frequent speculative transactions in the black market for foreign exchange, gold, securities, and goods than before the war. Recently, speculators have been arbitrarily spreading rumors in an attempt to make profits, causing violent fluctuations in the black markets for foreign exchange, gold, and securities. This situation is detrimental to the stability of the Shanghai financial market and is inconsistent with the government's financial policy. It is hoped that speculators will realize this.</p>
<p>International Exchange Center Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the silver and money industry yesterday that although the center of trade and finance in Shanghai after the fall has shifted internally, the international exchange still takes Shanghai as its center, and transactions remain prosperous. However, due to traffic congestion and weak purchasing power of the people, it is not as prosperous as in the past. As for the various banks and businesses, they are doing their best to cope with the drastic changes and maintain the market in this difficult environment. In addition to focusing on maintaining strength, their future business strategy is to gradually divide their resources in the southwest.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Cracking Down on Black Market Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Some Issue Foreign Exchange Certificates</p>
<p>According to sources in the financial community in Shanghai from Hong Kong and Chongqing, the National Government in Chongqing may issue foreign exchange certificates in the shortest possible time. Two months ago, when the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee stopped supplying foreign exchange to the black market in Shanghai, the chairman of the committee, Rogers, advocated issuing foreign exchange certificates, but this was not adopted by the Ministry of Finance. Recently, due to the situation, Rogers has been advocating his previous proposal more strongly. (Great Shanghai News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Rampant Issuance of Substitute Coupons, Petty Thieves Taking the Opportunity to Profit; Counterfeiting and Imitation Rampant; Three-Time Offender of Counterfeiting Huaji Coupons Sentenced <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>In early July of this year, Jing'an Zhuzhan on Jing'an Temple Road, Dinghexiang in Caojiadu, Dehexiang in Macgregor Road, Shenghexiang in Ningbo, Taichangxiang in Tiantong Road, Yuqingfeng, Yongshengxiang, Xingonghe, and Xinshunji in Xujiahui, and other 14 tobacco and paper stores, jointly organized a substitute coupon for one and two Fen of the Huaji Company to be given to customers. They contracted with the Ruiwen Printing House on Touji Bridge in the Public Concession to print a total of</p>
<p>480,000</p>
<p>sheets, totaling $7,200, which will be the responsibility of the 14 stores to recover in the future. On the 3rd of this month, an informant named Ma Genfa went to Jing'an Zhuzhan on Jing'an Temple Road and reported to the manager Hua Junwei that counterfeit one- and two-Fen substitute coupons of the Huaji Company of your tobacco and paper industry were being used in the market. The printer of the counterfeit coupons was the Haining Printing House at 1008 Haining Road in the Public Concession. Hua Junwei reported the information, and the Huisi Police Station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to the address, where they arrested</p>
<p>the owner of the printing house,</p>
<p>Yin Xigen, a native of Qingpu, and seized 24,000 one- and two-Fen substitute coupons of the Huaji Company that had already been printed, as well as several wooden molds. Yin confessed that the source was Peng Ruixiang, a native of Haimen who worked at the Huizhong Printing House at 7 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. The detectives then arrested Peng. According to Peng, the engraver was Wang Yichen, a native of Suzhou who lived in Caojiadu. Wang was subsequently arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng visited the Third Criminal Court for investigation and trial. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the Police Station,</p>
<p>explained the process.</p>
<p>Then, the victim, Hua Junwei, and Shen, the representative of Ruiwen Printing House, testified to everything. When questioned, the three defendants pushed the blame on each other. Wang Yichen confessed that there was still a principal offender named Yu who was at large. The court instructed Li Zhishan, the representative of the Public Works Department, to begin the debate. Lawyer Li stated that the defendants in this case had counterfeited the Fen coins substitute coupons of the Huaji Company, and the informant had obtained the clues and reported them to the Police Station, who arrested the defendants and seized several zinc plates and 24,000 substitute coupons that had been printed. The defendants confessed to the crime and the evidence matched the circumstances of the crime. The evidence is very clear, and the defendants</p>
<p>should be held criminally liable</p>
<p>without any possibility of escape. However, the lower court is requested to impose a heavy sentence. In recent times, due to the lack of one- and five-Fen auxiliary coins in Shanghai, stamps were initially used as substitutes, but stamps are easily damaged and soiled, and are inconvenient to use. Larger companies in Shanghai, such as the Tram Company, the Public Bus Company, and major department stores, have issued their own Fen coins substitute coupons due to practical needs in order to facilitate transactions. The legal basis for their right to issue is still questionable. After all, the issuance of banknotes by banks is still subject to the approval of the government's Ministry of Finance. How can other commercial and circulating substitute coupons be an exception? After large companies issued substitute coupons, various small shops</p>
<p>followed suit.</p>
<p>Even pancake stalls, tiger stoves, and tofu vendors printed their own Fen coins substitute coupons, of all colors and shapes, numbering in the thousands. If a shop or company has strong capital and sufficient reserves, and issues a fixed amount of Fen coins substitute coupons due to practical needs, it is not entirely unreasonable. However, if the most unscrupulous shopkeeper prints hundreds or thousands of yuan worth of substitute coupons with a printing fee of a few yuan or dozens of yuan, it is truly a way to make money. Unscrupulous people see that there is a great profit to be made and intensify their efforts, counterfeiting and imitating, without end. The victims are the general public, and the most pitiful are those of that class. The result of the defendants' crimes has a great impact on the entire society. Please punish them severely to deter others from following their example. Judge Huang sentenced Wang Yichen to one year of imprisonment for forging private documents, and Peng Ruixiang and Yin Xigen to eight months of imprisonment for the same crime. The seized evidence was confiscated according to the list.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Feng Chu (transliteration), a local resident, pushed two Japanese into the Huangpu River yesterday (20th) afternoon on the Bund, and then jumped in himself. He was subsequently rescued and taken to the Central Police Station, where he was accused of attempted murder. Feng is currently unemployed and penniless. According to his statement to the Police Station, his father was bombed to death in Zhabei two years ago, so he harbors deep hatred for the Japanese. He saw two Japanese civilians standing near the 11th wharf on the Bund yesterday, and suddenly made the decision to take revenge. As the two Japanese were standing together, Feng unexpectedly pushed one of them violently into the water, and then the other Japanese. However, Feng's actions were very quick, and it took a while before someone raised the alarm. The patrolmen heard the news and immediately began the rescue, but it was necessary to summon a water police boat to pull the three struggling people out of the river. It was found that the two Japanese were standing on the wharf to view the scenery, and did not know Feng at all. Feng Zeyong, a Shanghai native, is 19 years old (because he was born in the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, he is actually not yet 18 years old). He used to live on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. His father was a printer by profession, and his family was well-off, so Feng received a family education from an early age. When the August 13th Shanghai Battle broke out, Feng's family initially did not escape in time. On August 18th, due to the bombing by Japanese planes, the family business was</p>
<p>destroyed by artillery fire.</p>
<p>They had no choice but to find a way to escape into the Concession. As they were about to reach the border of the Concession, they were again bombed by Japanese planes. As a result, Feng's parents were bombed to death, and even their corpses could not be found. Feng barely escaped with his life and managed to take refuge in the Concession. However, Feng's parents were dead, and he had no relatives. Although he tried to find a job to support himself, he has not been able to do so. Fortunately, he had $300 in legal tender with him when he escaped, which he used to maintain his life. However, because he only had expenses and no income, the meager funds were eventually</p>
<p>exhausted.</p>
<p>As the weather grew colder day by day, and he was unfamiliar with the people and the place, and had no relatives to turn to, his hardship was no different from hell. He then had the thought of seeking death. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at around 3:30 PM, he went alone to Wharf No. 11 on the Bund, intending to commit suicide in the river to end his miserable life. Unexpectedly, the owner of the Japanese merchant ship Liyang Maru, Japanese Matsuo Toshishi, and engineer Ogata Yoshihisa were also at the wharf at this time, intending to take a barge across the river to the Nisshin Wharf in Pudong, Feng's brain was filled with the tragic death of his father, thinking that his family had been harmonious and carefree, but had been bombed by Japanese planes, and his parents</p>
<p>died tragically</p>
<p>without a trace, and the family business was ruined as a result. All these tragic consequences were caused by the Japanese. He immediately had the thought of avenging his parents, and immediately pushed the two Japanese into the Huangpu River, and then jumped in himself, intending to die together with them. However, both Japanese were good swimmers, so they were spared from disaster. Feng was also rescued by the people on the wharf. Under the investigation of Kobayashi, a Japanese detective from the Central Police Station, Feng's actions constituted attempted murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code, and he was taken into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Lawyer Ru Bao-i of the Police Station explained the process and presented the court with the statement Feng made at the Police Station explaining the reason for plotting to harm the two Japanese,</p>
<p>a single statement.</p>
<p>Matsuo Toshishi and others then recounted the circumstances at the time. When questioned, Feng Zeyong recounted the previous events and stated that he did not know the two Japanese at all, and only learned that they were Japanese when he overheard their conversation while he was planning to commit suicide yesterday, and then he had the thought of avenging his parents. After Judge Feng Shide verified the statements, he instructed Feng to be detained temporarily and rescheduled the hearing for one week later.</p>
<p>The Morris Case Continued Yesterday</p>
<p>Two Witnesses Give Same Testimony</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that Judge Haines of the British Consular Court held a police court yesterday (21st) morning to continue the trial of Morris, an employee of the Public Works Department's Health Department, who was charged with negligent homicide. Two more eyewitnesses gave testimony. The first eyewitness, Huang San (transliteration), a Chinese, unemployed, testified that at 2:15 AM on the 8th of this month, he had lost a little money playing mahjong at a friend's house on Baker Road, and then went to a noodle shop a little further down the road to order some food. While he was eating noodles, he saw two foreigners and one Chinese come out of a brothel across the street. The owner of the brothel came out with them. The taller foreigner beat the owner of the brothel to the ground, and the three men left. The eyewitness saw this and ran out of the shop to report it to the police. On the way, he encountered a Japanese naval patrol, who asked him why he was running. The eyewitness told them what had happened, and the Japanese soldiers went to the scene, he said. Wei Yuxin (transliteration), the owner of the noodle shop, gave testimony consistent with that of the first eyewitness. Licks, the defendant's defense lawyer, requested an adjournment so that the eyewitnesses could be cross-examined. Judge Haines adjourned the court and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Zou Zhengzhi, a local youth residing at 144 Fenshan Road (a relative of a well-known person in the city), is 19 years old and studies at the private Shanghai Middle School at 460 Chengdu Road, where he is also the class leader of the senior year. He had disagreements with classmate Fang Yimou (the maternal uncle of a certain military commander from Sichuan). At 10:30 AM on the 20th, Zou and Fang suddenly clashed in the school dormitory over a minor matter, leading to a physical fight. After teachers arrived and dispersed them, Zou, still unwilling to let it go, gathered others and violently beat Fang Yimou, causing him severe injuries and leaving him groaning in bed. Zou, realizing the trouble he had caused, was arrested by Detective Wang Shidong and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the above situation, saying that the injured party, Fang Yimou, was found by the hospital to have suffered serious injuries, with ruptured intestines requiring surgery. Therefore, it is not yet known if his life is in danger. He requested permission for a postponement to summon Judge Xiang Zuxian for questioning. The order was given to detain him and postpone the hearing for seven days.</p>
<p>Hua Chung Bank West District Branch Grand Opening</p>
<p>A New Highlight for Finance in West Shanghai</p>
<p>In recent years, West Shanghai has seen a dense population and a thriving market. The area around Caojiadu and Yanping Road is particularly flourishing. However, there has been a lack of financial institutions. Hua Chung Bank is a leader in the local banking industry, having been established the earliest and possessing substantial capital. Manager Huang Yuqi, aware of this situation, specially selected the intersection of Connaught Road and Hart Road to build a new building and establish the West District Branch. It aims to adjust surpluses and deficits, providing financial services to all sectors of West Shanghai. The news spread, and everyone rejoiced. Yesterday (the 21st) was the opening day of the branch. Connaught Road and Hart Road were bustling with traffic, a grand occasion. This not only demonstrates the urgent need for financial institutions in West Shanghai but also reflects the bank's excellent service record over the past decade, which has garnered widespread praise. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The branch is located at the corner of Connaught Road and Hart Road, directly accessible by bus route 10 and very close to trolleybus route 24. The building is a modern 1940s-style bank. The decorations are luxurious and exquisite. On the opening day, over 500 prominent figures and leaders from all sectors of society, including Wen Lantin, Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Yu Zuoting, Ma Shaoquan, Jiang Yiping, Xue Dubi, Chen Ziyi, Lu Wenshao, Xu Guanqun, Zhu Hegao, Wei Jinsan, He Wuliang, Jin Zongcheng, Xi Yushu, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Bangjun, Xia Xishi, Li Wenjie, Hu Chuqing, Wei Yiqing, Yuan Yang'an, Pan Xulun, Shen Jinyong, Wang Huailian, and Hu Guigeng, came to offer their congratulations. The number of cars and chartered vehicles stretched for hundreds of meters, making it a grand event. Manager Huang Yuqi and others of the bank were responsible for the reception. The Municipal Council also sent four armed police officers to maintain order. At 8:00 AM, Mr. Xu Jilao, a prominent figure in the financial community, held the flag-raising ceremony. Later, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Yunqi, and Pei Yunqing personally presided over the opening ceremony and took commemorative photos. The guests all expressed their admiration for the bank's thoughtful service. To commemorate the opening of the branch and to benefit all sectors, the bank has specially revised its various deposit and transaction regulations. This includes the direct matching of payment dates, extended payment hours, and Saturday morning office hours, all of which are precedents in the industry. It has also added both fixed and flexible trust deposits, with monthly interest accrual and the ability to withdraw principal and interest at any time. This provides the convenience of a current account and the superior interest rates of a fixed deposit, making it the most cost-effective deposit option. Furthermore, a women's trust department has been established, opening a new path for serving women in the city. It offers a full range of household services, accepts various women's deposits, and provides exquisite commemorative gifts for distribution. In total, over 600 accounts were opened throughout the day, with women's deposits accounting for over 200 of them.</p>
<p>Forcing a Young Girl into Prostitution</p>
<p>Qian Pushi, a 46-year-old woman from Suzhou, was struggling with poverty and hardship. Around the first month of the lunar year, she sold her 15-year-old daughter, Caiying, to Pan Axiu, a procuress from the same village, for 140 yuan. Caiying was renamed Simei and placed in Tang Ji Hanzhuang at 8 Guian Lane, North Chujia Bridge, to work as a prostitute. Recently, the French police received a letter from Suzhou reporting the incident. They dispatched detectives to arrest the procuress Pan Axiu, the girl, and the girl's mother, Qian Pushi, and brought them to the Second Special Court for legal prosecution. Judge Jiang Fengquan concluded the trial and scheduled a sentencing date, ordering the defendants to each provide a shop guarantee pending the verdict. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang sentenced Pan Axiu to four months of imprisonment for assisting in intentional rape. Qian Pushi was found not guilty, and Qian Caiying was handed over to her mother, Qian Pushi, with a written guarantee that she would not engage in prostitution again, under threat of severe punishment for any violation. The owner of Tang Ji Hanzhuang is reportedly being sought by the police for arrest and separate prosecution. Qian Pushi, a 46-year-old woman from Suzhou, was struggling with poverty and hardship.

<h3 id="e89">Regarding the Subsidized Rice for Staff of the Commercial Press: Staff Unanimously Request Conversion to Cash Allowance; Company's Shanghai Authorities Have Accepted the Proposal; Currently Requesting Instructions from Highest Authorities in Hong Kong <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the article introducing the subsidized rice scheme for staff of the Commercial Press in your esteemed publication yesterday, our association has some disagreement with these opinions. Therefore, we specifically submit a letter and an elaboration on the flaws of the subsidized rice scheme. We earnestly request its publication in your esteemed newspaper, and we would be extremely grateful. - The Commercial Press Staff Association (seal)</p>
<p>Due to the recent rapid rise in prices in the isolated island, all industries have automatically improved their compensation. Therefore, the staff of the Commercial Press, driven by the pressure of life, initiated a subsidy movement last month. After many twists and turns, the company recently announced the so-called subsidized rice scheme. (The details were published in the previous issue of this publication.) This scheme still has shortcomings, which are analyzed below:</p>
<p>(1) The subsidized rice scheme allocates grain according to the number of people in a household. Rural dependents are certainly not able to enjoy it, and families with more than two children also have no rice to eat. Furthermore, the salaries of junior staff are meager, and most dependents are unable to live in Shanghai, so they fundamentally cannot enjoy the benefits of subsidized rice.</p>
<p>(2) Since low-paid employees are mostly unable to bring their dependents with them, they can only eat at boarding houses when they are alone in Shanghai. How can they dispose of the twenty catties of subsidized rice provided by the company? Furthermore, the price is only about 1.7 or 1.8 yuan cheaper than the market price. In fact, the loss of time and transportation costs to buy this twenty catties of subsidized rice may exceed this amount!</p>
<p>(3) Rice weevils are notoriously bloodsucking creatures. The company's subsidized rice scheme, passing through their hands repeatedly, will undoubtedly be discounted in both quality and quantity. (The last time the company purchased rice for the staff, this phenomenon already occurred and can be cited as an example.)</p>
<p>(3) Originally, our purpose in initiating this subsidy movement was entirely for the sake of junior staff. In fact, the lower the salary, the more severe the pressure of life. This subsidized rice scheme still provides no practical benefit to the majority of junior staff. Therefore, we staff members absolutely do not accept this subsidized rice scheme. However, in order to protect the company and understand its difficulties, and unwilling to cause the company to increase its expenses during this extraordinary period, we calmly suggested two points to the company authorities:</p>
<p>1. The company should convert the subsidized rice expenses, which are budgeted at 10,000 yuan per month, into cash allowances for staff.</p>
<p>2. The standard should not be based on the number of family members, but on the individual salary of the staff member. The lower the salary, the more the subsidy should be. The maximum amount may be based on the 12.5 yuan announced by the company.</p>
<p>Now the company's Shanghai authorities have accepted our two proposals and are requesting instructions from the highest authorities in Hong Kong. We think that this will not increase the company's projected expenses, and it will also reduce many of the hassles of subsidized rice. We believe that General Manager Wang will certainly approve it. Then our great storm of February can be calmed down in this way.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Moon is Especially Bright During Mid-Autumn Festival <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>- Ziqiang</p>
<p>The "Ice" signs are still fluttering in the hot sun, but "Mid-Autumn Mooncakes" have already been baked early, adding color to the streets in early autumn. As fashionable women's new clothes change with the season, the competition between various businesses in Shanghai is also very sensitive. After the sweltering summer, everyone feels a different kind of pleasure at the arrival of early autumn: it is like a long-separated old friend, and like a lover in anticipation. A lively scene unfolds on the streets, and people's steps are firm and cheerful. In front of the silk and satin shops, men and women are crowded, cutting out winter clothes. They choose seasonal colors and calculate the distribution for the family.</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn is a good festival in early autumn, and perhaps to welcome the arrival of early autumn, the custom of a reunion festival has been established on this night of August 15th. Between friends and relatives, gifts are exchanged to enhance feelings, and families also make some preparations to enjoy the pleasures of family. The people who wander around these shops are full of joyful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Compared with previous years, even before the war, who can see any difference on the streets of the "isolated island" in early autumn?</p>
<p>But every year on the bright moon night, how can one bear to recall the past? The homeless people sleeping on the streets can no longer withstand the cold dew of midnight and early morning, and they are beginning to feel the threat of housing. Looking at the signs fluttering in the wind, they also feel the sorrow of "the whole family is in the cold wind, and the September clothes have not yet been cut."</p>
<p>And the arrival of this reunion festival adds infinite melancholy! Who does not have a happy family, who does not have sweet memories? But now, looking at our distant homes, only rubble remains; where have our parents, brothers, and sisters wandered to? On this moonlit night, how can we celebrate the joy of reunion?</p>
<p>The advertisements for mooncakes touch people's eyes, and the exquisite arrangements in the glass windows even tempt people's saliva. It is Mid-Autumn Festival, and the division between joy and sorrow, although separated by a clear gap, the scenery in front of us makes us doubt our own eyes - passers-by greet each other with smiles; all kinds of signs dazzle the eyes. Where can you find the division between joy and sorrow?</p>
<p>Five days later, on the evening under the bright moonlight, in the light breeze, perhaps someone will be chanting the poem "Raise your head and gaze at the bright moon, lower your head and think of your hometown." That is the answer you are looking for.</p>

<p>- Bao Tian</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Planning to Promote Medical Science and Education; Thinking to Expand Village Governance and Childcare</p>
<p>However, her reputation there is even greater than that of the Women and Children's Hospital. Many people who come to seek talent are also looking for talent from the Nursery, thinking that the nannies in the Nursery are top-notch. Otherwise, how could the triplets be so well cared for? Therefore, Dr. Zhang's position now has at least two aspects. One is the position of cultivating obstetric and pediatric medical talent, and the other is the position of cultivating nursery nanny talent. Naturally, her position has expanded, but she still wants to hold on to this position. Her current ambition is to establish a medical school in Anle Town; this medical school focuses on obstetrics and pediatrics. In addition, she wants to establish a nursing school, which, needless to say, focuses more on nannies for the Nursery, and wants to raise them to be able to serve as kindergarten teachers. Indeed, obstetrics and pediatrics departments everywhere feel a shortage, and nannies are also in greater demand than supply, because nurseries are being established everywhere. Although Dr. Zhang has made this wish, the funding problem has not yet been settled. Therefore, this time she turned to Mrs. Suriya's idea. To be honest, if she doesn't turn to her idea, then she won't, but once she turns to her idea, she has to beg for a big donation. Dr. Zhang's intention is to ask Mrs. Suriya for help, to find a way to raise a sum of money. With this sum of money, we can start running the school. These two schools can be opened in one place, so it's good to be able to practice there. When people come to seek talent, we can recommend them to various places. In one year, we can train at least hundreds of talents. If Mrs. Suriya is willing to support this school for training talents on her own, then we will name this school Suriya School to leave a memorial for Mr. Suriya. Although Dr. Zhang and Mrs. Suriya have this friendship, it also depends on Jin Danyun's encouragement from the side, beating a side drum. Therefore, this time, in addition to personally visiting Mrs. Suriya, Zhu Ai will also take the opportunity to ask this bride for a big favor at the wedding banquet. Because this is a good thing, the inland areas lack those villagers, causing ordinary people to sink into diseases and suffering. And the infant mortality rate is increasing because the protection is not proper, which is especially alarming. I hope Jin Danyun can help, give birth to a fair and plump son next year, which is to repay your kindness! Because Yu Danyun has always had no requests for Mrs. Suriya, and has never asked her to help with anything. Now Jin Danyun is saying good words to Mrs. Suriya for this public welfare matter, Mrs. Suriya must agree with a full mouth. (184)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Suzhou Creek's Night Pilgrimage Before the Transformation <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>- Liu Lang</p>
<p>As we eagerly await the opening of the Hongkou district, the obstacles on the north bank of Suzhou Road are beginning to expand and swell through the incubation of the air.</p>
<p>I stepped onto the north bank of Suzhou Creek on the eve of its transformation with a feeling of regret. I don't know if I am on a pilgrimage? Or is it a lament?</p>
<p>The evolution of history is cruel. Although the north bank of Suzhou Creek is so ordinary, yesterday's north bank of Suzhou Creek suddenly became beautiful in my eyes. I ignited a reluctant affection for it. I wanted to comfort it, but how could I start to comfort it? However, the last impression it left me will never be erased.</p>
<p>When I crossed the Suzhou Creek that was like a dyeing vat, my heart was unusually excited.</p>
<p>When I reached the end of North Henan Road, I couldn't bear to see the scenery at the end of my eyes, but the worn-out picture at the end still tightly gripped people's hearts, making you feel pain, making you feel resentment.</p>
<p>Right next to that iron gate, I saw the young, dashing, and orderly Scottish soldiers. From their beautiful steps, my heart also raised pieces of gratitude, thanking them for fulfilling their life's obligations on the north bank of Suzhou Creek, enduring the artificial wind, frost, rain, and snow.</p>
<p>I quietly walked east along Laobazi Road, and looked suspiciously at the building under repair wrapped in lead wire mesh at the Fusheng Road intersection. Ahead, the obstacles tell you that you have to turn on North Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>From that turning place, I discovered the new wounds that had been added here. The triangular lead wire mesh tightly surrounded the street-facing houses at the eastern end of North Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>Like visiting a prison, friends of passers-by met at both ends of the lead wire mesh. They couldn't be intimately together, they could only stand at both ends and talk. People outside the circle bought things from the shops inside the circle, shrinking like escapees.</p>
<p>Wenjianshi Road and Zhapu Road have completely changed their appearance. I feel the same infinite attachment to the British soldiers standing on the edge as I do to the worried residents.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Ten Thousand People Compete to See a Red Pearl! (Part 1) - A Record of Song Dezhu, Who Finally Came Out After a Thousand Calls <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>- Tong Yu Yuchi</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 19th) afternoon, I went to lecture at two universities. After returning to my humble study, I saw two name cards from Song Dezhu and Wu Yanheng on my desk, as well as a letter of introduction from Mr. Zhou Guanqing of the Beiping Youth Association. I knew they had been there while I was out. After asking my family, I also learned that Mr. Wu Huansun had accompanied them. Mr. Wu's Chinese painting and drama studies have long been admired by me. I felt very regretful for losing the opportunity to meet them immediately.</p>
<p>In the South, the general friends who like to talk about old operas, after reading Tongzhai's drama talks that I have been writing continuously for the past two years, have no doubt that Dezhu and I must have had a very deep friendship in the past. The people in Beiping are also like this. For example, in the recently published Liyan Pictorial Issue 49, someone wrote an article saying: "Song Dezhu's decision to go to Shanghai, with Mr. Tongzhai Yiyi's prior propaganda, has already achieved the point of winning without fighting." In fact, I have said before that Dezhu and I have never met; I have never done propaganda for Song Dezhu or anyone else. I have always been a cautious and taciturn person. Not only can I not write articles, but I am also poor at wording and speaking. I teach in the university, and the students only know that Mr. Liu's blackboard notes are particularly numerous, but they do not feel that he particularly likes to lecture. In this way, when I met and shook hands with Mr. Wu, Dezhu, Baosen, Yanheng and others in a certain place this afternoon (the 20th), I was so ashamed that I couldn't say a word?</p>
<p>But why should I say anything? Dezhu, who amazed everyone with his first performance, has now become a dazzling "red pearl." As I implied in the above, I actually have not contributed a single bit. The leader of the female martial roles is originally rare in the old opera circles, often not getting one or two outstanding talents in ten or twenty years. As far as I can see, Jiu Zhenfeng (deceased), Zhu Guifang, Qiu Futang, Fang Lianyuan..., they all enjoyed fame on the red carpet for the past twenty years with their skills in female martial roles. Unfortunately, they are now like withered flowers, leaving the stage and no longer able to "sway the spring breeze and please the spring day"! In recent years? Song Dezhu, Ge Shishan, and Zhu Shengfu can all be regarded as the newest talents in female martial roles. Shengfu is Guifang's nephew, and Shishan is Lanqiu's (Jiu Zhenfeng) nephew. Both of them have previously performed in Shanghai with other troupes and have received considerable praise. However, in fact, their art is not as superior as Song Dezhu's. When Dezhu was "sitting on the stage" at the Beiping Opera School, because of his superb art, coupled with his willingness to work hard for seven or eight years without interruption, and the patient guidance of the masters of female martial roles, Jiu Zhenfeng, and famous teachers such as Zhu Ruxiang and Wu Fuqin, he has become the leader of the four little famous actors praised by Mr. Xu Lingxiao, the only famous actor who combines "singing, acting, reciting, and fighting". Zhang Shankun personally directed Chen Yunshang's third masterpiece "One Night Empress" premiered at the Shanghai Grand Theater during the Mid-Autumn Festival</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Full Picture of Nan Tiesheng's Art (Part 2) <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>- Sick Chicken</p>
<p>Acting and Waist and Legs</p>
<p>Acting includes expressions, steps, water sleeves, body movements, and other items. Tiesheng is best at performing tragedies, with dignified gestures, calm demeanor, and movements tending to be restrained, which is quite in line with the Qingyi style. The steps are steady and practiced, but lack a graceful and elegant style. The starting step is too fast, without asking for the old road step method. The Qizhuang step method is excellent, which may be influenced by Yaoqing. The water sleeves are too reserved, too steady, resulting in few light and graceful movements, and failing to reach the realm of beauty, which needs to be improved. The body movements also have the same problem, without natural postures. The eyes on the face lack changes, and lack inner performance, failing to fully reveal the plot of the play, resulting in heavy acting plays, such as the "whole Yutang Spring lacking prostitute house chasing Wang sections, the performance is very loose, without highlights, which is due to insufficient technical cultivation and lack of stage experience. Although the waist and legs are necessary skills for martial girls and knife horse girls, Qingyi Huashan is also indispensable. For example, the "Changban Slope" round field, the "Imperial Stele Pavilion" slip step, the "Stab Tang" butt sitting, the "Baihua Pavilion" lying fish, the "Farewell My Concubine" sword dance, etc., without waist and leg skills, it is difficult to be competent and happy. Tiesheng, a ticket fan, went to sea, and the waist and legs did not work hard. When the "court trial sang to the adults," there was a sitting, Tiesheng supported the ground with his hands, and the body was very stiff, showing the childishness of his waist and leg skills. If you want to improve, you must work hard.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>To sum up, his art has already given a glimpse of its outline. Tiesheng is a Qingyi talent. Except for the singing voice, all have not reached the ultimate state. However, in this time of shallow and vulgar appreciation standards, how many people can deeply appreciate the rules? Correct Qingyi acting and discover its beauty, and Qingyi has more singing plays, and acting is originally a decisive point, and at the same time, acting is also one of the easiest links to appreciate, because in addition to one or two very shallow problems, ordinary people are very difficult to distinguish between good and bad in singing and reciting, so the "good singing" and "bad singing" said by ordinary people are actually a synonym for expressions that fit the plot and my. Now that Tiesheng has a good voice, if he can devote himself to expression, it is not difficult to become popular in the north and south.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Hollywood on the Silver Screen <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Yuan</p>
<p>Regarding films made with Hollywood as their theme and background, there was only one previously, "Lotus仙子" (Fúróng xiānzǐ, "Lotus Fairy"). Now, let me introduce two more. One has already been filmed, and the other is in the planning stages.</p>
<p>The film that has already been completed is "Hollywood Cavalcade." It is a grand, colorful production starring Don Ameche, Alice Faye, and Lin Bapa. Al Jolson also makes a cameo in this film, singing a famous song, "Kol Nidre." The film is directed by Irving Cummings and produced by the well-known Darryl Zanuck. The entire film is set against the backdrop of the diverse aspects of Hollywood in the past three years, making it very lively.</p>
<p>The other film currently in pre-production is Warner's colorful blockbuster, "City of the Angels," which is set eighty years ago in Los Angeles and Hollywood, with a touch of legendary color. The main roles are played by Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, and Ann Sheridan. We know that Los Angeles was a barren land eighty years ago, with most of its residents being rogues and scoundrels. Now, using this as the theme is certainly comparable to "The Public Enemy".</p>
<h3 id="e97">Viewing Experiences After "Sunrise" <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Wei</p>
<p>The 辣 (Là) Theater, following "Thunderstorm," is performing "Sunrise." Because the cast of this play are all stars, its appeal is quite remarkable. I went to see it the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The allocation of roles surpasses even the golden age of 中旅 (Zhōng Lǚ): Lu Luming's Chen Bailu, in terms of costumes and makeup, is better than Tang Ruoqing, and her attitude is also quite good, but her pronunciation is very low, which is enough to affect the atmosphere on stage. Because Meng Na's performance as Gu Banainai is realistically atrocious, it often makes Lu Luming smile on stage, which is also undesirable; Zhou Manhua's Xiaodongxi has many lovely qualities; Bai Yan's Cuixi, however, is not good. I have always believed that Cuixi is the most difficult character to portray in "Sunrise." Bai Yan, lacking both boldness and experience, loses all the wonderful aspects that should be there. The inability to speak crisply and decisively is also a major reason for her failure to please. Among the male actors, Zhou Qi's Wang Fusheng is undoubtedly the most captivating, reaching a level of perfection; Bai Yun's Zhang Qiaozhi is, of course, not as skilled as Zheng Zhong.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhong, directing with his qualifications as a former member of 中旅, although generally passable, is not without minor flaws. For example, in terms of sound effects, during the hotel scene, one only hears the sound of playing cards, but never the sound of "shuffling" or "winning," which seems inappropriate; the sound effects in the brothel scene, using two different technologies, produce the same sound, which is also unsatisfactory. Shu Shi's Pan Yueting seems to lack richness in his costumes. Also, when Pan Yueting is on the phone, Gu Banainai is talking to Chen Bailu, and because Gu Banainai is "acting," it causes applause from the audience, but Shu Shi does not continue his phone conversation, instead waiting for Gu Banainai to finish speaking before continuing his lines. This is not only illogical but also has the appearance of desperately trying to please.</p>
<p>The set and lighting are very good, but unfortunately, during the most tense moment in the third act, the lights went out once.</p>

<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>Xu Muyun, Su Shaoqing, Xu Heizhen, Zhang Xiaocang, Li Feishu, Zheng Guoyi, Huang Jingwan, etc., recognizing that dramatic literature and artifacts urgently need to be vigorously promoted to prevent them from being lost over time, and that refugees on the isolated island urgently need to be rescued to prevent them from suffering from hunger and cold, have jointly launched the "Chinese Drama Martial Arts Cultural Relics Exhibition." All proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to refugee relief, achieving two goals with one action. They have already received the support of Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jikang, and Chen Buchan, among others, to proceed immediately. A preface has already been written, and Pu Dong (Xiyuan), a senior scholar in the field of drama, has been invited to inscribe the title. This is a groundbreaking event, and those with a passion for drama are expected to witness its success soon.</p>
