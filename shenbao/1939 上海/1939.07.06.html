<h3 id="c5">蒙「滿」過境衝突事件 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>自五月間起，時傳蒙「滿」邊境發生衝突，日本且曾以「空戰偉大勝利」，在國際間作誇大的宣傳。據最近消息，衝突頗有逐漸擴大的傾向。日本駐英大使館，已於日昨在倫敦正式發表官報，宣佈自七月一日起，實行「防禦性質」的反攻；同時東京各報，並極力宣傳日蘇關係的緊張；甚至謂由於蘇聯駐日大使和代辦的先後奉召回國，已使兩國國交在實際上斷絕關係，表示日蘇戰爭、儼然有一觸即發的可能。</p>
<p>這次蒙「滿」邊境的衝突，和去年春季的張鼓峯事件如出一轍，又是起因於所謂越境事件；可是到底那一方面首先越境，這將成爲一個永不可解的謎。不過衝突的起因是一事，由衝突而演變成爲正式的戰爭又是一事。誰願挑釁，誰就可以利用越境事件來作藉口：就日本駐英大使館所發表的官報看來，雖極力將越境責任諉之於蘇蒙軍隊；而自己却又聲稱，曾派遣空軍轟炸外蒙領土，並公然宣稱，定期採取攻勢。</p>
<p>挑釁是一事，而挑釁者是否有作戰的能力和決心，自然又是另外一事。日蘇戰爭，事實上確是無可避免：日本要完成大陸政策，必須消除蘇聯在遠東的勢力：蘇聯也知道要保全國土的完整，就必得糾正日本獨覇遠束的企圖。依目前情勢而論，兩國在軍事上的佈置，都已到達劍拔弩張的嚴重階段；但這祗是表面的情形：實際上日本在侵略中國的時期之中，決無對蘇作戰的能力，也沒有作戰的決心。日本對華作戰，現在已兩周年，焦頭爛額，欲罷不能；國內的兵力還不夠在中國各戰塲上分配，又何能向蘇聯作大規模的攻擊？在經濟方面，日本雖已實行了總動員法令，尙不能負担侵華的費用，更何能籌出比侵華費用更大的財源？至就日本發動對蘇作戰決心而論：日本果欲對蘇決戰，則一年前日本所保持的軍事經濟力量，遠勝目前，在一年前就不會爲張鼓峯事件，而中途屈膝了。還有一點很明顯的，日本不使這次衝突發生在蘇「滿」邊境，而發生在蒙「滿」邊境，這就是力圖避免和蘇聯發生正面的衝突。</p>
<p>日本沒有對蘇作戰的能力和決心，而這次造成蒙滿衝突是具有「一石投雙鳥」的作用。一爲對國內政治方面的企圖：日本自對華作戰以來，由近衛內閣而平沼內閣，在日本軍閥心目中，始終認爲柔弱無能：尤其爲着對於歐美在華勢力的排斥，不能採取斷然決然的手段，以及對於德義兩國不肯締結軍事同盟，使他們大失所望。他們企圖以擴大作戰範圍爲藉口，而組織純軍人支配的軍事內閣，以便完成侵略迷夢。最近謠傳日本即將發生倒閣風潮，怕就是這種作用的徵候。</p>
<p>另一作用則是爲應付國際局勢，而在外交上所採取的佯攻；其最大的目的，在破壊英法蘇三國協定的成立，和饗應最近德國在歐洲方面對但澤所作的姿勢。目前英蘇談判已經逐漸接近，倘使英法蘇三國協定成立，無諭是否涉及遠東問題，但由於歐洲局勢之獲得安定，她們必然多些機會與力量來注意遠東。日本爲避免遭受干涉起見，便藉蒙「滿」衝突以宣傳蘇聯軍力的脆弱，使英法動搖其聯蘇的決心。日本過去宣傳日本空軍，曾在多次戰役中，以少數飛機擊落蘇聯飛機數十架甚至數百架，此事誰敢輕信！而最近日本偏把蒙「滿」衝突經過情形，在倫敦發表官報，這更顯明地暴露了她的眞正用意。至於日本爲響應德國，而在遠東故意造成緊張的局勢，這更是歐亞法西斯一貫的政策；她們企圖因遠東的嚴重形勢而分散英法對波蘭的援助力量，這當然又是與德國遙相呼應的一種舉動。</p>
<p>世界上自作聰明者，結果常會弄巧成拙。日本這次的蒙「滿」衝突，將使英法蘇感受同樣的壓迫，而迅速的促使三國互助協定的成立，最近巴黎倫敦便已光後透出了談判樂觀的消息。並且由於日本響應德國的行動，更足令英法蘇覺悟到世界的安全，是沒有地域之分的。遠束當然不是一個例外！</p>

<h3 id="c38">西班牙到那裏去？ <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 天風譯　Salvador　De　Madrlaga　原著　原載四月十六日The　Sunday　Tlmes．london</p>
<p>本文的作者是一位有名的西班牙作家與外交家，其對自己祖國的前途的推測，當然比外國人較爲深刻。但正因爲他是西班牙人，當爲外國報紙著文論及本國的政治動向之時，措辭不得不很謹愼。然而本文的分析却是異常淸晰，而其結論也是大致正確的。——譯者</p>
<p>阿爾巴尼亞的遭劫，處於軸心國家恐嚇下的東歐諸國得到保陣，以及西班牙內戰的終止，都已變更了歐洲的均勢了。但變更到什麼程度呢？這多半視未來大戰發生時，西班牙的態度而定。爲着避免因武斷，情感，宜傳，以及願望等等所生的錯誤起見，我們最好用事實來分析一下。</p>
<p>第一件事實是，在三種理論上可能的情形中（即加入英法方面，中立，或加入軸心國家方面——譯者），只有兩種是値得討論的：中立，或站在全能國家方面。這是從以下二種觀察得到的結論：－是內戰時某些强國對西班牙的態度；一是即在上次大戰那樣理想的情况下，協約國竟也不能將她拉到她們那邊來。因此，在分析現在的局勢時，不利於加入全能國家陣綫的因素，可當作有利於保守中立者。</p>
<p>不利於中立的因素</p>
<p>第一，山於新政權對義大利及德意志的謝忱。這種感覺是不容輕視的，雖然倫敦報紙上會發表過相反的意見。西班牙的歷史告訴我們，西班牙人是十分富於『報答』的精神的，而這種精神會滲入她的外交政策中去。</p>
<p>第二，西班牙從未被意大利統治而受苦，她只被德國統治過一次。然而英國掌握着直布羅陀，却是西班牙半島與西班牙帝國發生分裂的主要原動力。至於法國，她很少因與西班牙的關係而鼓動，這可拿摩洛哥的歷史作證。</p>
<p>第三個因素是新政權的最大力量（國民工團運動－Mational　Syndiealist　Movement）對法西斯和納粹國家的親善。</p>
<p>第四，全能國家的軍事進攻政策，會使她們耍求政治上的代價，作爲她們在內戰時幫忙的報酬。</p>
<p>第五，由於「戰利品」的可能的誘惑，而這種戰利品可從對英法的戰爭中得到。尤其是直布羅陀，沒有一個西班牙國家、王義者，不以爲是被英國非法併去的；至於摩洛哥，法國是那邊的敵人。</p>
<p>第六，受良好訓練的得勝的軍隊，在內戰軍事行動告終後，有一種占據的欲望。（此指德意軍隊的遲遲不撤，現在大部已撤回。－譯者）</p>
<p>利於中立的因素</p>
<p>另一方面的第一點理由，是强有力的中立的傳統精神，這是因擺脫幻象的思想和懐疑主義而發生的。而此種精神，除了最好戰，最極端的國家主義者外，都因內戰而加强發展了。</p>
<p>第二，「與英國和平相處差不多是一種同樣强烈的傳統。如果倫敦的穩重政策不變，這種傳統無疑地將鼓舞西班牙中立。</p>
<p>第三，對西歐各國有着一種普遍的同情。雖然沒有定限，不可壓制，却是和較遠的德意聯盟的明確的障礙。</p>
<p>第四，是一般西班牙人士對意大利文和意大利人的可驚的缺乏尊敬。因爲西班牙文和意大利文異常相似，使一種文字和另一種一比，聽起來就很是可笑。此外是由於西班牙人有一種傾向，把意大利的事物看作戲劇的活動。這個因素，聽起來是抽象的，然而像許多出乎自覺的力量一般，異常重要，而不應加以低估。</p>
<p>第五是西班牙覺得，在內戰時，國民軍得到的帮助並非爲着西班牙，而是爲着別的原因。這感想是一定在發展起來了，因爲意大利把撤退志願軍的事，像一種資產似的談判着。</p>
<p>還有別的原因。其中之一是英法在商業上是重要的顧客；西班牙對意大利貿易不利，因爲意大利的生產消費情形和西班牙相似；向德國那樣的國家，去維持差强人意的商業，也有朋顯的阻礙，因爲德國尙在自己遭受損害的情態下掙扎。</p>
<p>此外還有地理上的因素。意大利很難與西班牙成立連接的戰綫；至於德國，則簡直是不可能的。在西班牙國家主義者運動背後，還有自由的保守者與保皇的天主敎的勢力存在。他們當然對全能主義的反天主敎的氣氛感到不愉快。</p>
<p>另一點很重要，即是葡萄牙的地位。葡萄牙是西班牙最先的朋友，也注定是英國的同盟者。西班牙與葡萄牙的互不侵犯協定，等於國民軍統治下的西班牙，對聯英的葡萄牙答應守中立。</p>
<p>最後，人民已深深感到戰爭的苦痛了。每個有思想的西班牙人都深信只有中立才能得到國家的統一，才能重建西班牙。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>以上皆是事實。我們從此並不能得到決定的結論，但幾個一般的觀察是可以斷定的。</p>
<p>（一）時候帮助中立，大戰爆發愈早，國民軍統治下的西班牙，愈難與其盟國分離而守中立。</p>
<p>（二）西歐各國對西班牙的政策也有大關係，這不但在於對軸心國的紛擾，應有具建設性的堅定的對策，而且應給西班牙確實的給與，如此方能抵銷軸心國給國民軍的帮助。</p>
<p>（三）到目前止，一切現象對中立的說數不利，這包括反共協定的加入與義大利兵的延遲離開西國等等。</p>
<p>（四）假如西班牙與軸心國一致運動，無論就戰略就政略而言，她總將是一種負擔，而不是有用的資產。</p>

<p>定海通信、定海縣爲舟山羣島最大之海島、位於浙江之東、西與鎭海穿山僅一水之隔、東南與象山接界、其東靑浜·苗子湖·等島、則與日本相交界、孤懸海外、爲中國漁鹽業之大產地、共轄沈家門·在城·衜頭·大展·四鎮、及臯洩·白泉·鹽倉·干　·等十八鄕、地區廣大、居民共有四十二萬、民性敦樸、但海島漁民、則較强悍、自新任縣長蘇本善接事後、領導政工隊員、改進政治、收編海匪、充實自衛力量、在最短期間內、定海已顯有進步、此次日軍突在定海登陸、警隊以事起倉卒、且日軍砲火猛烈、故衆寡不敵、數小時間、縣城卽吿失陷、殊堪痛心、茲紀經過詳情如次、</p>
<p>登岸情形</p>
<p>定海爲漁鹽之重要產地、日人早已覬覦、惟前因定海無重大之軍事價値、且知華方駐相當兵力、故不敢佔領、近則日人因急欲進攻寗波鎭海、故將定海佔領、以作根據地、一面自岱山被日軍盤踞後、華方敢死隊、常渡海襲擊、岱山漢奸等、於是向日方獻媚、力言定海之重要、爲鞏固岱山起見、必先佔領定海縣、於是日軍乃於六月二十三日淸晨三時許、攫奪定海、一面在城偏西角距離約十里之鹽倉螺頭上岸、一面在田螺峙附近上岸、經西起嶺小溪跟、從東門進城、同時有日艦二艘、泊沈家門對面之馬峙洋面、亦於二十三日淸晨、在沈鎭西離約五六里之墩頭上岸、一面又用小型日艦、在縣城北面秀山洋面、向離城約三十里之干　鄉發砲騷擾、以亂後方、一面在衝頭五奎山泊日艦二艘、用砲向城內猛轟、以掩護登岸之日兵、總計日軍分三處上岸、二處騷擾、三路人數約一千餘人、因有漢奸引導、故路徑熟悉、且在上岸時、城中漢奸、卽在城區燃放爆竹、以爲信號、一面用「大日本」旗、懸掛四城、以混亂軍心、故定海之淪陷、實亡於漢奸手中也、</p>
<p>激戰情形</p>
<p>當日軍在鹽倉登岸時、因均著草綠色制服、頭戴鋼盔、絕似華方之自衛隊、故居民皆茫然不知、後見其用機槍亂掃、方知爲日兵、駐曉峯嶺之第六區國民抗日自衛隊第一大隊聞訊、當由隊長蔣士林·楊開祖·中隊長宋盛濟·等率部奮勇抗戰、激戰達一小時、終因日軍砲火猛烈、不得已乃安然撤退、日軍從而撲入西城、蘇縣長得報、當親率所部、在城內巷戰、在北門警察局門前、激戰最烈、後華軍退至北郊、由定海縣自衛隊第一大隊長張甫成、率領湘省健兒、奮勇抗戰、張大隊長前會在紅軍充少將游擊總指揮、作戰經騐甚豐富、故身先士卒、冒彈雨激戰達數小時、斃日軍甚衆、至沈家門方面、自日兵在墩頭上岸後、行經西橫塘白虎山前、駐該地沈鎭自衛隊、當卽展開戰事、該隊具等雖係士紳子弟、且皆盡義務、但士氣之壯、較正規軍無遜色、故是役兩軍傷亡均重當時華方水警隊、亦由大隊長王品元率領抵抗、互戰數小時、因衆寡不敵、乃退至大展螺門、渡海至石浦、待援反攻、至二十三日晚、蘇縣長在煩河與縣司令部主任參謀丁淞生·張大隊長、等計劃反攻、一面並調秀山鄉自衛隊、當該鄕聞人厲雪帆召集該鄕英勇壯丁、派赴三江守防殺敵、至晚十二時、張大隊長乃復率領所屬過煩河嶺、至北城反攻、華方手溜彈等、猛轟日軍陣地、日兵見華軍夜襲、卽倉皇應戰、用機槍漫無標的掃射、後因城門堅固、且彈火猛烈、華軍乃安返原地、日軍因見華軍時常突擊、異常恐慌、故近在四城趕築工事、裝置砲位、以防華軍反攻、</p>
<p>壯烈殉難</p>
<p>當日軍在定海强行上岸時、華方軍民、卽予迎頭痛擊、壯烈犧牲者甚衆、據探得六區抗衛隊約死傷七八人、縣抗日自衛隊死傷三四十人、大隊附周信寳亦同時殉難、幹部訓練班學員死四五人、衛頭鎭副隊長葉夢麟、爲大沙鄉長葉寳昌之長公子、勇敢善戰、此次不幸在東郊陣亡、尙有政治工作隊隊員高良才、因奉縣長命去探聽日情、當自行車抵北郊時、就日軍已佔領北城、於是日軍以機槍猛射高身、當被彈傷左臂、幾乎暈厥、後經救護隊抬至鄉間醫院、又聞舟山中學學生及宣傳工作隊隊員、因不及逃避、受難者頗多、居民方面、雖於事變前、早已疏散至四郊、但究屬少數、故死傷約計六七十人、聞北大街五康米店老闆許文彩、因回店取米、致遭日軍擊斃、又當華軍撤退至金塘島渡海至甬時、遭遇日艦、當被砲轟、並以重機槍密集掃射、因此第三區自衛隊獨立中隊、約有七十餘人、連船共被擊沉、秀山鄉自衛隊殉難者、爲羅隊長·及隊員童信才·陳全章·阿冬等數人、該鄉聞人厲雪帆、因見該隊員等忠勇可嘉、故慷慨解囊、撫恤其家屬、以安忠魂、至是役死難官兵、蘇縣長當呈請黃主席、予以撫恤、並明令褒獎、</p>
<p>渡海請援</p>
<p>當日軍於二十三日淸晨拂曉攻城時、蘇縣長率部抗戰、後因孤軍無援、乃於九時退至須河長春嶺一帶、是日十時餘、定海城乃吿完全淪陷、翌晨、蘇縣長因見衆寡不敵、且孤軍無援、故率頒所屬、過岑港、渡海至册子島、又偸渡至穿山、赴甬轉金、向黃主席面陳事變經過、並講援反攻、故定海軍隊、現均安全撤退、惟存少數自衛團在鄕維持治安耳、至最可恥者、爲副司令羅恥狄、當日軍轟城時、竟不顧地方、先至舟山中學、陪同該校女敎師北平女子師範大學畢業生范亞維、先逃至小沙、並在當地敲詐六百餘元、渡海他逸、尙有第三區自衛獨立中隊長李崇賢、率部至册子島、向當地捐募數千元、名爲充軍餉、實則飽私囊、此輩貪生怕死、敲詐、勒索、不能與城共存亡之官長、實應嚴厲懲辦也、</p>
<p>日人搜索</p>
<p>當日軍佔領定海時、卽以飛機散發傳單、措詞極荒謬、該項傳單、係彩色鉛印、共發二號、至日兵行動、首先將東嶽宮神殿·及北郊普慈寺、縱火焚燬、並搜索民家、檢査時、遇婦女卽加以調笑、並强行佔據東門大余橋下王傳孫住宅、作爲日本司令部、東郊趙家洋房、作爲海軍司令部、並在南門觀音橋潘尙林家駐兵、復强佔美國浸禮會辦之舟山中小學、在北門舟山小學駐司令長官、在西門舟山中學駐日兵、每晚並拖拉女人至長官處、次晨方釋出、送些膾品、以爲紀念、復抽拉壯丁、搆築工事、工作後、送戒子或鐲子以爲誘惑、可是壯丁獲釋後、行經別處時、又被日兵奪去、靑年數百人被捉、囚於北門干大聖廟內、不供飯食、任其飢餓、復在東門東管廟內、囚靑年婦女一百餘人、每日供飯二頓、任意蹂躪、近並向偽維持會提出條件、謂（一）每保抽壯丁四十名、以爲應用、（二）在定日兵約六百名、保證不可缺少一名、故羣醜已甚感窘迫、至沈家門方面、日人暴行、更爲恐怖、將縣商會·鎭公所·前劉寄亭先生之地址、縱火焚燬、復將宮墩·天后宮·東嶽宮·民衆敎育館·沈警察所·等房屋、一律焚燬、一時火光冲天、全市皆紅、烈燄飛騰、燃一日餘方熄、二十四日、日軍復由漢奸引導、至各鄕村搜索、定海本多高山峻嶺、游擊戰大可展開、但因軍隊完全撤退、故窮鄉僻岙、亦均有日人之魔跡、且有爲虎作倀之漢奸領導、鼠膽更大、先至煩河搜索、復至臯洩搜索、至白鶴廟時、因貯有洋粉等糧食、且爲鄉公所、故卽縱火焚燬、臯洩離白泉甚近但日兵搜索至舒家乃返城、故日泉·干　·馬岙·北蟬·紫微·等鄕、均尙未搜索、二十七日、復過長春嶺．亂草嶺·小樹嶺·大樹嶺·至小沙搜索、挨戶檢査、並在大廟內駐兵、且令該鄕交出第三區主任岳樹猷·鄉長樂志雲·及士紳陳子平等、以爲利用作傀儡、但該三人等早已逃逸無踪、故日方甚感失望、次日、卽赴岑港搜索、又至子闊烏坵張刺椗子等僻岙搜索、檢査畢、乃乘船至衜頭返城、至沈家門日軍、聞近已搜索至大展等鄉、</p>
<p>傀儡陣容</p>
<p>自日軍在定海登陸後、城內無恥流氓、均乘火打刧、並獻媚日人、爲虎作倀、現僞治安維持會已組織成就、會長爲前定海第一任縣長丁紫垣充任、其餘會中重要人物、據傳爲舟山中學校長方洞源·眞神堂牧師陳德宏·士紳陳二梅·勸募工作隊隊長沈坤權·食糧公司主任洪琪良·國西戴元璋等、但據傳丁紫垣因年已衰老、不能他逃、致被迫充任、陳二梅沈坤權等、係本縣富紳、爲顧全家產起見、故不得已充任、至方同源爲保全舟中校產、故不得已忍痛事仇、陳牧師則因欲救濟難民、故留定未逃、被迫充任、該偽會長等、在平時均係熱心淸正份子、此次雖被迫充任偽職、想以地方爲重、不致魚肉民衆也、現治安已恢復、居民均可入城、但須通行磴、聞在北城替維持會繕通行證者爲何垂滄、南城爲某國醫、故現下居民、均已紛紛返城、在日人之鐵蹄下、過慘痛之生活、</p>
<p>秀山危急</p>
<p>縣屬蘭秀鄉、爲本縣大海島、位於定海與岱山之中、目下形勢危急、該鄉民衆、大都皆經商上海、並運輸魚產及黃沙赴滬銷售、時有船雙來往秀山上海間、近因岱山定海相繼淪陷、情勢突轉緊急、且該鄕自衛隊、又調至定海作戰、防務空虛、於是該鄉鄕畏童信立、常卽會同該鄉聞人厲雪帆·林良坤·及政工隊員陳楠墀·金邦華·桂唯一等、收集民間槍械百餘枝、齊集鄉間壯丁、組織游擊隊、藉以抗日自衛、每晚並在蘭山海口等放哨、遇有船卽嗚槍、喝令下蓬、嚴密檢査、故秀山現在自衛武力甚充實、近H據傳岱山僞維持會寄信往秀山鄉公所、請童鄕長去岱山、其用意似欲以政治手段、佔領秀山、若不去、則日軍卽將以武力進攻秀山、童旣得訊、當在北浦四旋廟、召開聯保會議、討論應付方法、當時民衆因恐日心理甚盛、均勸童赴岱接洽、並向布店買白布、自製太陽旗、懸掛門前、並集資製一大日本旗、懸在海岸前面、以爲總旗、藉保平安、且謂「日本人明日來玩戲、我們都到埠頭去迎接、」此輩愚民、發此傷心病狂之言、殊堪浩歎、童及海岙靑年鄔通才厲家範等、當卽勸止又童當議會時、卽激昂言日、我決不赴岱、作爲虎作倀之事、倘日軍來犯、則惟有統率游擊隊、與之死拚、至家中房屋家產、則雖焚於砲火、亦所不惜、因當此强敵腰境千鈞一髮之際、爲地方負責人、祇知盡忠殉職、與鄕土共存亡、不能再以家室爲念矣、情詞壯烈、大感民心、均贊呼不止、定海旣吿淪陷、從此魚鹽業之重要產地，已爲他人蹂躪、四十二萬之民衆、亦處於黑暗地獄之中、定海雖在訂江寗條約時、英國會聲言定海決不許任何國侵犯、不然、當由英國保護、可是定海今已淪陷了、英國則默無一言、故當地人士、亟應猛醒、切勿依賴成性、而應自力更生也、</p>

<p>淪陷區域內之各海關、因爲政府權力所不及、以致入超增加、消除困難、以上海江海關而言、今年一月份入超九百三十五萬六千元、二月份入超五首十二萬九千元、三月份入超三千三百零九萬二千元、四月份入超二千四百七十三萬七千元、五月份入超三千八百六十七萬一千元、已創戰後之入超新紀錄、而進口之貨、尤以奢侈品及非必需品居多、此後是項奢侈品及非必需品之進口、勢必减少、</p>
<p>供給外滙　限制黑市</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、財政部所頒佈之禁止進口貨物辦法、雖已命令總稅務飭屬遵辦、但淪陷區域之上海關等、實施在事實上不無困難、是此種海關已爲日所刦奪、如稅收被截、被迫易幟、政府雖已下令禁止、仍無法阻止其由淪階各關輸入、惟公佈申請外匯規則後、此項禁止之貨、勢必無法購得外匯、所以預料中交兩行實行掛脾、供給必需品外匯後、匯豐銀行或將限制供給黑市外匯、</p>
<p>並不影響　各國貿易</p>
<p>中國政府將禁止非必需品及奢侈品進口之外匯、移用於購買抗建必需之物料、所以中國不過變更外匯用途、在各國不過轉換其輸入物品、故各國對中國之貿易、並不受到任何影饗、聞歐美各國對中華之必要之措施、已表示充分之諒解、惟日本貨物之輸入中國、則確將蒙受極大之影響、其佔第一位之地位、勢必降落、因日貨進口之貨、以後勢必無法再向黑市套買外匯、</p>
<p>進口繳納　出口領取</p>
<p>中央銀行之决定外匯行市、始終依照原定政策辦理、即英匯一先令二辦士半·美匯三十美元、惟中國·交通·兩行之掛牌、英匯爲七辦士、美匯爲十三元六二五、並規定必需品之進口申請外匯、須繳納外匯差額、土貨之出口售給外匯、得領取外匯差額、以期一律而昭公允、所謂外匯差額、即中國交通兩行之掛牌行市、與中央銀行公佈法定價格相差之額、謂之差額、</p>

<p>紗市趨疲、跌風益熾、蓋以安定金融新辦法頒佈後、銀根緊縮、一般押款到期之貨、目前不得轉押掉期、且前途催贖尤急、於此浮虛乏力之額、祗得照市斬結、市場益形紊亂、至於某豐大戶、心中頗有拉提之念、無奈受環境支配、不能如願、近來在市進進出出、較前減少、市盤乃傾向下降、二十支雙馬一跌十元外、但某某等仍坐視不動云、</p>

<p>本棉交易稍見活動、但成交之額量微乎其微、廠方絕無採辦之念、同業稍有納胃、不過此項棉花、大都轉輾售於他廠、抵解頭寸交易也、惟外棉同行互相買賣較為熱鬧、但售價比封關前為鬆、實則鈔票緊縮之故也、蘇北來源甚稀、碼頭上僅到下沙花六十包、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨晨清寂逾恒、南北洋兩幫、均受時局影響、及現鈔問題、恐一時難望開展、除少數零星點綴外、迄無整額之銷化、而廠方亦均擬擯守待機、故二號粉仍站四元六角半之現鈔、對於匯劃、概不接受、市面仍在擯持中、至本街零批交易、前因停市後、進胃一度較濃、而昨以銀根緊急、匯劃貼現高昂、故成交亦由萬餘包減至六七千包云、</p>

<p>— 周志峰</p>
<p>上海之有呢羢業、肇始於同治年間、爾來已七十年矣、故不特為全中國之先驅、抑且為進出口之總紐、在此七十年中、呢羢行市之漲跌變化、營業之逐年擴大、與夫本客銷路之進展、花樣顏色之翻新、姑置不論、（記者有便、再當逐一加以追述、）茲所談者、為呢羢業之今昔異動、</p>
<p>昔當民國五六年之際、呢羢市場、集中於虹口百老匯路蓬路一帶、計有信義公·仁義公·洪記·老生記·全記·兆記·何錦豐·廣生·公興·聯興·公大·興泰·嘉泰·源泰·恒和·震大·信康·祥源·福泰·永泰·咸昌·協生裕·源豐·信益·祥泰裕·瑞泰昌等廿餘家、歐戰之後、遭受先令重大打擊、除咸昌一家外、莫不虧蝕、（因咸昌經理吳善登、於八九先令時、全部套進、故能賺錢、其他各號、均在看長、購定者不及三分之一、厥後匯票狂瀉、致大受其虧）因是先後倒閉者、不一而足、風潮過後、重歸平復、新開者乃有義昌泰·福順·陳福記·源大昶·公和·永信祥·福昌等、改組者有源泰改為元大、惟舊有者除全記·兆記·何錦豐·恒和·順昌祥·聯興昌記外、則俱已收歇矣、此時上洋拆貨幫、新舊祗十餘家耳、而上海棋盤街大路幫、突轉興旺、市場有上海上洋二派之分、所謂上海大路幫者、為新豐·美綸·春和永·泰和利·華綸·復新·華新·志大·元泰·興昌祥·協興·匯康·聚康·復康·怡康·承大·華康·大錀·永豐·久豐·時新·華昌·元和祥等二十餘家、而開設在新開河一帶者、（專做下檔爛糊貨）、則有永裕泰·顧瑞記·聚興·興裕等數家、可見當時大路幫之繁盛、店鋪之多、亦已超過拆貨幫、致呢羢市場之重心、逐漸移向「上海」、而呢羢同業公會、亦於斯時由「上洋」遷至「上海」矣、</p>
<p>民國十六年、北伐統一、呢羢市銷大暢、但外匯忽起變化、繼之我國關稅自主、修改國定稅則、上洋上海二幫呢羢業、復起異動、南京路範圍較大之西服店、如裕昌祥·王興昌·榮昌祥·王順泰等、均帶做拆貨、四川路順興德昌亦出樣版·張隆泰老合興裁縫鋪、俱設呢羢店、上洋拆貨幫新開者、有益豐·漢豐·景泰·太豐·滋源·安升昌·豐餘·天豐·餘記等、上海大路幫新開者、有生昌·新昌·元昌·華孚泰·華盛·祥興·裕昌·洽豐·衡豐·和豐·美豐·復昌祥·萬成永等、其後洛續開設者尚有大生·永興·裕康·德康·益大·鴻興·華成祥·同和祥·久和·泰豐·仁德祥等十餘家、但至今皆已收歇矣、呢羢公會、亦由南京路遷至棋盤街、蓋呢羢大市、已集中於斯故耳、此時同業公會會員店號、大小共計七十五家、執行委員為徐梅卿·葛傑臣·劉達才·洪輔元·陳梅芳·費榮甫·周企逢·王廉方·陳殼庭·王厚甫·陳樹楠·章金琯·倪國才·王聲和等十四人（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c143">疋頭　津幫發動　秋令貨　東市因現鈔價昂下挫 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>國布　昨法幣貼現率突升、怡和粗布現鈔價開售每疋跌去五分、匯劃售盤各貨價仍堅定、慶豐廠嗶嘰上月現墊價每碼匯劃五角零五釐、本月份增價一分半、綫呢亦增價二分、開售五角四分半、實銷以北路稍活動、烟台幫續辦色布漂布綫呢粗布四五十件、天津幫原訂巨額、秋莊定貨刻亦漸有發動、藍布綫呢等貨續有裝出、每班數十件、滇幫以郵遞上月一度恢復後、即行停止收寄、且以非常時期運輸艱難、中途擱貨過夥、週轉不靈、近且匯兌暴升至十二元五角、來款愈增困難、故川滇新成交均極冷淡、本街零星交易尚勤、府綢嗶嘰漂布洋紗及印花布成交千餘疋、白貨粗布細斜亦辦四五十件、香港幫添辦細斜紋振中國慶等牌三十餘件、</p>
<p>東布　昨細布細斜市盤、因現鈔貼水續昂、一致下挫、每疋俱跌一角左右、十二磅龍頭細布現貨做開十四元一角至一角半、陽鶴細斜每疋價十三元九角、實銷生意寥若晨星、市氣暗淡、市場皮球交易亦遠非昔比、故全日同業中互相成交者仍祗二三百件、</p>
<h3 id="c144">呢絨定貨一落千丈 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>昨日呢絨現貨交易仍少、而市價始終挺漲、洋行定貨、交易則一落千丈、拆貨幫大路幫及字號幫、均全無問津、即其談判將成與已扣實之定單尚未送達者、現多紛紛相率回絕、良以現市之六辨士五匯票、業中人大都尚看再小、呢絨成本勢必激增、大半俱不肯冒險定貨、因之邇來上海一般英·美·法·德·波蘭·捷克·意大利等商行營業、復轉寥落矣、</p>
<h3 id="c145">藥材　藿香貨缺暴騰 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>國藥中之藿香、功能解表疏邪、入脾達肺、香可宣中快膈、醒胃清神、其性屬微溫、兼能辟疫止嘔、又頗善散、故為暑期中之要藥、現屆旺銷之時、刻據業中人云、號貨地存已不厚、且海南來貨中斷、致人心大都看高、邇來市上售價日昂、較前竟漲起二十四五元之鉅矣、</p>

<p>香菇近日香港幫採辦頻仍、市勢仍續挺、如昨日售出之建菇其價三百二十元、比前市漲起四十五元、成交江西菇數件、以身份較遜、故略帶霉、價為三百十八元六角、</p>
<h3 id="c147">麒菜堅挺 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>麒菜今日去銷尚活、昨續有售開、計武敦菜為二十一元、西蘭菜二十四元、龍牙菜二十三元、獅毛菜二十八元、較前市各升一二元、</p>

<p>螟蜅新貨邇來陸續有到、故此間存底尚稱充裕、刻市甯波普通莊仍售二十八元、提大須四十元、正舟山貨開六十八元、較漲起十餘元、且到貨奇缺、頗有供不應求之勢、</p>
<h3 id="c149">南北貨　冷氣荔枝干高升 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>金山枝自貯入冷氣棧後、成本日昂、而來源亦乏、因此趨勢步緊、昨市冷氣元枝已高喊七十元、比前加起十餘元、冷氣糯米枝尤覺堅昂、須售一百五十元、前後漲度近二十元云、</p>

<p>金針菜自汕頭淪陷後、銷區更覺狹窄、故雖值貼水高昂、亦無激漲、昨普通貨開出數十包、價為二十元、高貨仍缺難鬆、須三十一二元、次莊僅十七元左右、聞本年新貨、因交通時有阻礙、未能及時登場、惟徐州或可有少數趕到、大約本月中旬當可見貨云、</p>
<h3 id="c152">煤炭　婆羅洲煤仍昂 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>烟煤生意、平淡無勁、市場每日成交不滿五百噸、但行情因成本攸關、貨主把持、仍堅挺如恒、日昨婆羅洲煤、由其號吐出、少數做開、計統煤每噸四十七元、篩塊五十一元、同業棧房自出、送到客家、尚須加另行摃雜費、</p>
<h3 id="c153">小子煤到貨不多　不敷分派價難回降　印煤有七千噸到滬 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>鴻基小子煤曾以現貨軋缺、開價一再上展、最高價每噸竟達五十六元、尚無貨供應、日前德匯洋行略有到貨、但亦祗百五六十噸、不敷分派、故價仍難回降、送到另加行摃、加之篩出下身屑子之消耗、門市每籮七元二角五分、尚係當差性質、</p>
<p>四日怡和洋行經理之「Winkfild」號輪、由喀爾喀塔裝來煤斤七千零五十八噸、已於日前（三日）抵吳淞口、因浦江內無碼頭浮筒停泊、乃在口外拋錨等候、現悉三十四三十五號浮筒已空、該公司乃命該輪、昨晨六時進口、拋泊三十四三十五號浮筒過駁、又該公司經理之「Baron　Inckhape」號、亦自喀爾喀塔運來煤九千一百噸、該輪約本星期六（八日）可到滬、（祖）</p>

<p>生鐵銷場、本街鐵工廠及外部客商均有納胃、但自最近以來、價格高昂、因之本街生意異常清淡、而外路商幫（如天津·北平·青島·烟臺·甯波·福建·安徽·及長江路等）、亦因環境與船期等種種關係、幾至無貨出口、行情因本市各貨激增、市盤如頭號印度生鐵每公噸售二百六十五元、二號售二百五十五元、頭號俄國生鐵每公噸估二百五十五元、頭號揚子六河　產貨每公噸售二百五十五元、二號貨則開二百四十五元、均比前市漲起有二十餘元之巨、</p>

<p>黑鐵皮市情、前雖一度熱鬧、因各廠家及客幫等爭相採辦所致、但自最近以來、因該貨價格節節增高、而各路銷胃反呆、如本埠熱水瓶廠等俱稀動靜、此外客幫如天津·青島·等亦採辦極微、因之熱鬧之市象、已非昔比、然行情却較前加上有四五元之鉅、如三張至十張貨每市担開二十八元、十一張特售二十九元、十二張貨沽三十元、十三張貨售三十二元、（以上均為三尺六尺）、十八張則開二十七元五角、二尺六尺貨、查昨日成交僅三四十担而已、</p>

<p>— 智慧</p>
<p>晚上離家時不要把電燈都熄滅，最好能夠留一二號，因為竊賊不大會進有燈光的房間的。</p>
<p>不要把論匙放在蓆下，門上，或信箱內。</p>
<p>不要把錢或貴重的東西放在地毯下，或掛在鏡子後面，瓦器內，或蓆墊下。因為這些地方是竊賊進門後第一搜索或留意著的。</p>
<p>不要放鏈鎖在門外，因為這樣子，等於在告訴人家你不在家裏。</p>
<p>若是你的論匙遺失了，不要忘記去配一把新的鎖。</p>
<p>假使在屋子內發現在盜賊，不要開燈，只要靜靜的打電話通知巡捕房。</p>
<p>在沒有顯出證書時，不要護那些自稱為貨物推銷員，抄電表人，跑街等進你的屋子。若有疑惑，在沒有護他們進來或在走廊內與他們商談前，先打電話詢問一聲他們的僱主。</p>
<p>不要向陌生人買價錢很便宜的東西，因為這些東西是冒牌或偷來的。最好立刻呌巡捕。倘然這東西是真值錢的，他們一定會自已保存起來，或賣給他們的朋友的。</p>
<p>不要忽略去查詢你僕人的保人，也不要在電話裏問問蓆頭就算數了。最好自已親去問。</p>
<p>不要因對方衣飾頗為整齊而相信他是好人，而炫誇你自已的富有。現代的歹人，再也不會告訴你他是歹人的。</p>
<p>在店裏買物時不要把錢袋放在櫃毫上，這是竊賊們不時在找尋着的好機會。</p>
<p>不要在電車或公共汽車上打瞌睡，這是給扒手們一個很好的機會，來偷去你的貴重品。</p>
<p>有人問你時間，不要把錶拿出來看，這往往給竊賊們一個好機會來搶掉你的錶。</p>
<p>在公共場所，不要讓任何人把報紙遮住你的臉；這種人是想要你的錶或別種貴重物品；他們是在蒙蔽你的視綫，以利他同黨偷竊。</p>
<h3 id="c157">雨天帶的帽子 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>連朝黃霉雨，出去真有些去，撐一頂傘，穿一雙套鞋多麼累贅，尤其穿了西裝，外面罩上一件雨衣，頭上帶一雙什麼帽子好？要旣能避水，又不損壞，這裏，就來談談：</p>
<p>有人把舊的呢帽當做雨帽，這果然是合算的了，但是質料劣性的帽，只會擋小雨，像黃霉時的雨滴它就沒遮攔了，同時現在時令，呢帽已是過時，最好帶草帽，最近市上有一種茜草草帽，樣子很摩登，十塊半錢起五六十塊錢的也有，雨頭裏儘跑，決不會流進頭髪根，回到家裏，把抹布一揩，照樣簇新，對於原來帽質毫無損毀，反而將晴天溷聚在上面的塵埃洗去，所以這種帽子，用不到往洗染商店去洗的，可是價錢太昂貴了，一般人買不起，還得另想別法。</p>
<p>自已只有一只呢帽，雨天也可以帶，切勿怕帽子上染到的雨斑弄不掉，即使白色的呢帽也沒有關係，我們有個方法，待天晴後，把雨天帶過的尼帽，光用揮發乾洗劑洗刷，懸起京曬，使它乾燥勻淨，然後買一瓶雙氣水（藥房裏可以購買）噴二三次，每噴一次，必須等它全乾後再噴第二次，直噴至雨斑完全去掉纔止，如果一次污斑已除，當然毋庸噴第二次了。</p>
<p>真的，雨天對於穿西裝的人最覺困難，要使帶的帽子不失大方華貴，只能用上面的方法，假使再想不費手脚，則應有晴雨用禮帽纔行呀！</p>

<p>馬鈴馨，俗稱洋山芋，也是菜蔬類中最富於維太命一種；而且價格也比較低廉，在我的經濟菜單中，應當占一個重要地位的。煮法很多，並且無論葷的素的，它全都合得來，倘以人類相比，那就是一位和藹可親而善於交際的朋友。燒咖啡哩難，簡直非馬鈴薯作伴不可，而紅燒豬肉羊肉等，也不妨請它加入。至於素菜中，那麼紅燒素十景，也得需用到它，與捲心菜同樣是主要的東西。近來吾家常吃兩種菜，一葷一素，都利用馬鈴薯，且來介紹與讀者們試試；葷的是薯泥牛肉餅，將薯去皮燒熟塢爛，略加麪包屑和菱粉，放入油中煎黃，再將切細的牛肉和洋蔥做成餅形，入鍋同炒，也須加些菱粉在內，牛肉便不覺老鞥；吃的時候，就將薯餅與牛肉餅合在一起攪和，很為可口，不吃牛肉的可用豬肉。素的是將薯去皮燒熟搗爛之後，加了怱花或切細的雪菜同煎，也可以下飯。</p>

<p>— 朝陽舊侶</p>
<p>國人眼光中之海外僑衆，在數百年之內，應劃分為三個時期。清室閉關自守，西美南洋，槪同化外，官府之視僑衆如草芥，僑衆之視官府如寇響。民國盛與，急於內戰，粗通洋話之輩為公使，國內望之若帝天，官府之視僑衆如犬馬，僑衆之視官府如路人。最近數年，外患日迫，全國下下之思想精神，由散漫而歸於統一，僑衆匯款向國內，成為補裨一國收支平衡者之廣大源泉，官方之倚恃僑衆，大致如手足，而僑衆之維護官府，大多數已如腹心。以是平時擅作威福之少數駐使，遇有能力不足，發生不能保護僑衆之破綻時，即欲諉責於人，亦煞費唇舌，僑衆能力之不可侮，愈後而愈明。爰為衣食住行之四要端，以明海外為國奪門者生活進步之實況。</p>
<p>一曰衣　除閩粵海員，服務於西方估舶，分司燒火洗衣諸役之時，以藍白短衫褲為最適用外。其居城市中者，歐美各國，旣盡西裝，我僑衆自不能獨為例外，共可憑以判斷生活之優絀者，為冠覆與大　短褂品質之等差。次則凡為僑衆，恒喜佩帶中華民國青天白日景泰藍銀質褂章，以自別於其他各國之東方民族。近年溫州青田等浙僑之旅居西歐諸國者，則有一小部分，賴製售領帶為生。</p>
<p>二曰行　新時代以車代步，深合乎寸金寸陰之箴，其更速於車輛者為飛機；自置飛機之富僑，雖然未之前聞，而在僑庽歷史最悠久之西美南洋，自備汽車一部以至數十部者，卻已不是為異。其次如在地勞廣坦無高山之西之歐荷蘭，所見溫州籍之浙僑，北起涵塘　Amster-dam　南暨郡王林　Hertogen-bosch，織補器皿等等之轉愉，莫不爭踏自由車以分途飛駛。次則行之一事，最是以見我華人奪門能力之偉大者，莫如橫絕亞歐兩大陸之徒步遠遊。湖北天門人之於紙花，山東煙臺人之於綢料，浙江青田人之於有塊齊植Mosaic細工，近者深入俄境，逮者直達巴黎，行程之遼闊，或數千里或萬里，若得好事者，演為筆記而播諸銀壇，定是激增無量數後起青年聞發內地與邊陲之毅力。其由廣州出嫁，向全球作徒步旅行之黃逸光君，且以宇宙學堂，以大自然為課本，置諸先進國探險之林，應無愧色。</p>
<p>三曰住　中國人在歐美之特質享受，最感生活程度之不同者莫如「住」而英美人好靜惡器，相沿成癖。僑衆出海發生關係較早之地偏在英美，其苦習慣之相懸絕者，尤莫如「住」。凡西方之城市，貓大終日無聲，聖稚掩重關而不聞啼哭。我國極少數富紳子女之僑庸紐約朝陽墩Morningsite　Heights者，會以某姓孩一夕之哭，而至全數寓公，一律被迫他徒。至今北美各城，莫不有唐人街China　town之特別區，受習慣所限制，是具最大原因之一，可斷言也。今日者時異勞殊，中國人抗戰以來之見重於歐美社會，義證以楊惠敏女士旅美實歷之談，益足打破崇洋即華者之谀見。甚至如一九三九年之金門大博覽會會場，且知標榜唐人街以異翘於天下。誠如戴季陶先生之論，謂支那之二字，總有一日，可因國人之努力而門變為美名。中國人住之一事，與西方人事受相　絕之又一原因在乎儉，儒衆勤苦煞日，救國念切而自奉甚徵，當國難期為允甚，比謁劵尚否廢之民國某大使臣，彼此事得其反。是以歐洲各在陸國市民生活，雖不若英美人之低嚴，而柏林之突娣堡Gharlotten-hmrg，巴黎之　丁區。荷蘭洛塘之　堂渡Katen-dreeht，遂亦如紐約下城之夙便容納華人。</p>
<p>四曰食　我中國之最足自豪於世者，為其肴僎品類之美備與豐贍，而粵庖尤獨擅其妙。統觀歐美各國之餐館，惟巴黎市資格最老之爾廚司為南京籍，餘者幾乎盡為廣東賓安籍。其設於荷蘭者有七處，最老者為袁華主辦之中國樓，（設於洛塘市德理街Delistraat十八號）次為吳富所創之廣興樓，（涵塘內番擔擔）又次為鄧生經理之中山樓，（洛塘）又次為張國樞之遠東酒店，（海才和平宮畔）又次為吳子駿之在東樓，（涵塘研缽街七十二號）又次為酬祖之南洋樓，（海牙同生路Thomsonlaan五十號）而最小者乃為馮生之好餐館，（萊汀市Leiden管業街二十一號），七家盡以賓安人為舖主。他</p>
<p>如巴黎諸天宮直下向聖戈民大道BD.St.Germain之中華飯店，巴黎倫敦雨大城成為兄弟公司之萬花樓與探花樓，舊金山之上海樓，華府之南京樓，悂府Philadelpia之神州樓，使我出遊海外諸士商，所至慶賓至如歸之樂者，皆此粵僑授餐設館之功也。至若海員之食，則清儉之中又加堅苦，似彼行人所不易知。前於太平洋會議期間被舉為國民外交委員會副會長周蕘階君之經驗談有去：「船上勤工，雖苦景浪不容睡，海昌不食即無力，食之雖吐而仍當繼績進食，如是者兩日，即可自勉強而漸成習慣，求免暈吐之食法，為忌茶湯與水，共　於船工者，每知勸人多嚼鍋焦飯而口　防黨參」。周君此說，兼有助於自力更生之出洋學子，足與新時代飛機乘客所備防吐之新藥，相得而益彪也。</p>

<h3 id="c163">廣仁 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>一說起仁，就要帶到義，或者連類而帶到道德。可是仁義道德是人人知道的，並且孔孟兩位老夫子已說過許多，講過不少，似乎也用不著再添一句話了。然而現在時世文明，有許多事情都是從前所沒有的，仁的範圍內也增加了不少項目，卻也不能不將這仁來廣牠一下，以便昭示後世。</p>
<p>例如仁即慈，慈即慈善事業。現在的慈善事業中，不如早早送他上西天，較為得當。又有剋扣救濟費，或者盜賣賑糧這幾項，這是因為管理這事業的，覺得救濟自己是急於救濟難民，而不救濟自己就難以救濟難民，他們這樣的舉動，還是以慈悲為懷的。同樣，為了辦埋慈善事業，要添幾部汽車，衣食住都要考究些，也都在天公地道的情理之中，因為不這樣，他們寶貴的工夫要多費，而繫許多人安危的玉體就要違和了。至於流離街頭的貧民和乞丐，不必救濟，以鼓勵其自立自養之心，一旦凍餒而死，然後為之棺殮，更是功德無量，因為拋屍露骨，到底是仁者所不忍的，而收拾起來，免得一旦腐化，疫癘橫生，累及自身，那不是仁至義盡的善舉？</p>
<p>我還聽見一種慈善家，他的舉動真有些匪夷所思。他有錢，就去收羅許多貧女，住在他所指定的院子裏，終身不許出園門一步，榮任他的無名而有實的姨太太，使她們一生吃着不盡。當然誰都稱頌他，因為假使他不這樣做，這些貧女也許早就填之溝壑了。於是現在又一些力量較小的慈善家，去領幾個或男或女的苦孩子，教他們唱戲　，教她們跳舞等等，有「一技之長」，為他賺錢，養他並以自養，我們也就只有稱頌他了。</p>
<p>不過慈善事業的仁，還是社會的和個人的，到底不及國家的仁來得偉大。國家的仁便是所謂仁政。我們已經略略知道大範圍的慈善事業是什麽了，也就不能不知道大範圍的仁政是什麽，此亦所謂廣也。</p>
<p>原來古聖流傳下來的仁政是救濟鰥寡孤獨以至「內無怨女，外無曠夫」之類。現在呢，的確有人如此做；不過他們的人手辦法，先要造成許多鰥寡孤獨，怨女曠夫，作為救濟的準備。他們說，不這樣，仁政便無從施起。</p>
<p>此外，據說還另有一種仁政，對於任何人都要救濟一下。譬如你受了欺侮要報復，他會來勸你不必報復，說，一報復，勝負之數既未定，就有危險要冒，萬一敗了，就活不成，萬一勝了，未免使他人下不去，要弄到同歸於盡，還不如就以向欺侮我們的低頭求和，來得十拿九穩，足以縮了頭不遭危險，苟全性命。……他們大有「大王去邠」的遺風，仁風廣播，自然遠在「文王發政施仁」之上。我想天下後世，一定要在歷史上為他們大響特書，與以一再歌頌的！</p>
<p>不過這樣的仁政還只有人主張，是否行得通，還在不可知之數。假使果然給他們行通了，也許大家真會同登「彼岸」吧！嗚呼仁政！</p>
<p>記得有一個著名的和尚，吃雞蛋時作了一個偈，末後兩句是：「老僧帶爾西天去，免在人間吃一刀。」這個和尚的確是一個仁人君子，我所要廣的仁，大都就等於這個和尚的吃雞蛋，聰明的人就此類推吧，不再「舉一個例子」了。</p>

<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>—徐州突圍回憶記</p>
<p>在霧似的曙光中，隊伍像一條長蛇，在田埂上蜿蜒着。極目無邊的田野裏，滿是一片成熟了的麥子，乾巴巴的，那麥粒一顆顆是那末飽滿的，可愛的，但任牠丟在田裏，迎着風在抖擻著，慢慢的朽腐下去！</p>
<p>隨著夜色的褪去，一個個點綴在這遼闊的大地上，像一些玲瓏的小公園似的村莊，穿着一身悅目的綠服，清清楚楚的現出來了。這些村莊都有着同一樣的佈置：周圍給安了一條水溝防衛著，溝旁滿種著棗樹和桑樹，高粱桿蓋的草房，半掩藏在園叢裏，村裏沒有南方村莊的那種熏人的牛屎味，走進去就像走進了什麽小公園似的，使人有一種不忍離去的留戀。</p>
<p>過了朱家莊，天忽　得那末陰沉沉的，猛刮起風來，接着便下起雨來了。</p>
<p>隊伍仍在前进着，雨打到被太陽燒得要發昏的頭上，感覺得一種舒適的涼爽，但很快的一會，全身便濕淋淋了，雨滴像一條條小溪在臉上奔流着，又向濕透了的衣服上滴下………</p>
<p>「師長的命令：傳上去——跑步！」</p>
<p>「師長的命令：傳上去——跑步！」</p>
<p>聲音一個一個的傳過去，聽不見了，隊伍便隨着跑了起來。</p>
<p>路是一條恰够兩個人平排着跑的土路，路上瀦積着一塘一塘的泥水，踏在這泥濘的土路上，人一個一個的不由得滑倒了，但馬上便爬了起來，又拚命的向前跑着，要跑到我們的目的地。這不是我們現在抗戰的象徵麽：雖有挫折，只要打下去，終有勝利。</p>
<p>不知是在下午的什麽時候，到了李新集了，這是一個相當大的土城，老百姓雖然没有完全跑開，但都躱在家裏緊閉着門……</p>
<p>這似乎對我們有些誤會，我們立刻便找到了一個人在街上傳着鑼：</p>
<p>「這是我們的軍隊，趕快開脱鋪子門，公買公賣，不准抬高市價！」</p>
<p>鑼傳過後，緊閉着的鋪子門果真開脱了，每家鋪子門前，擁着一團穿着濕淋淋的衣服的人羣，生意是從來没有過的熱閙，老板快活的忙碌着，似乎在心裏笑了：「這些我們的軍隊是不錯的！……」</p>
<p>雨越下越大，在深夜裏，一支友軍冒着傾盆的大雨，衝進城裏來，聽着那嘈雜的脚歩聽，心裏不由得想着：好，我們幹下去，不是孤獨的！</p>
<h3 id="c166">我的夢 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 錢昌年</p>
<p>人們常懷著許多夢想，因為人的情感往往盲目地牽了人的心向各處去飛，正如走路沒有一定的路綫，認不清方向，找不到一個盡頭。那些只能在留片刻的，美妙的，奇異的夢想造成了人們如紙鷂般浮璗著不安定的心情，如細柳條枝的影子在微風中被吹動著那般紛亂的感覺。</p>
<p>在這裏，你得不到一點刺激，也不會感到疲乏，真覺得好像是在做「夢」；在這裏，你得不到一刹那的安定，沒有一刻使你實在的，沉默的去「想」。一切都是那麼空洞，虛渺。這夢想，不是那含有靈性的，可以開花而後結實的朶子，祗是思想的幻海中浮著的浪花。牠衝走了人類創造自己的雄氣，捲走了人們緊握著的生命的綫索！</p>
<p>我也有自己的夢想；它不像那雨過天晴時偶然現在天邊的彩虹那樣，祗是單純的美；不像頃刻間便消失的暴雷聲那麼只震動一下人的耳鼓；更不是真如夢般的找不著邊沿。牠是我思想的結晶，是我心房裏僅有的花朵，牠會漸漸地開放。但，這並不是牠的最後；僅有開放並不可貴，牠的最後是不裝潢表面而肥滿的果實！</p>
<p>那些空泛的夢想佔不了我的心，我心憂一個要真正實現的夢想，因為我知道我生存是為了什麽。我不要像雲游般的逍遙走向那水月鏡花的意境，讓時光把我的鬚髮催成了斑白，然後又像殘花般的追憐自己的命運。我不要像隔了紗幔似的，只看到那模糊的，美妙的人生底面，我不要用我的眼來支配我的快樂，因為我深切地懂得這樣的快樂纔會成了明日黃花！</p>
<p>我要看盡世上的醜陋，虛偽；我要看那獰笑，愛哭，怒目，長臉，和那大滴的汗珠子變成金錢！</p>
<p>但，我要做些什麽？我要把我的「真」驅走人類的「偽」，以我的「善」溶化了他們的「惡」，給他們的裏苦的臉上換上他們從不曾有滿的笑！</p>
<h3 id="c167">從「反」說起 <a href="#c167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒生</p>
<p>現在文壇上正在如火如荼的展開著「反」的運動。「反」有時會嫌不夠，義憤填膺的以「淺薄」，「不懂付麼」，「不知付麼為何物」，引證了一大奪之後，就以「照照鏡子，知道你自己」來徵了結束，這種態度我以為非懂得不到「反」的效果，相反的給讀者起了對本身不良的印象。</p>
<p>考查這次要「反」的對象，是「個人主義」和「機機論者」。探本謹源，還是在「八股」與「藝術」兩點上互相擺結。不過我的拙見是「八股」需要，「藝術」更需要；但不能超脫時代，什麽都得與「抗戰」有緊密的關係。</p>
<p>論爭本也需要，但第一目標不要遊離了時代。「八股」而屬於「抗戰」，到底還是需要，固然，只須「藝術」而有關「抗戰」，是更其需要。但也不能肯定說：「抗戰八股」都是些「內容淺薄的理論文章」。</p>
<p>我們回頭來看，所謂「藝術」已「深入」與「提高」到如何階段呢；「純文藝」的風氣，確很囂張，且尚在蓬勃的滋長著。但從幾種「純文藝」刊物裏面，我們能嗅得出血淋淋的現實氣味嗎？話一不當心，又將涉到「八股」土去，這可是極「不妥當」的？不過這要求非常普遍，大多數青年會喊出：「我們要血淋淋的東西。」這也難怪，因為生長在這樣的時代的青年，看來誰也護不了超脫時代的東西。</p>
<p>據說「純文藝」刊物之所以這樣蓬勃，理由也並不這樣單純--爲了藝術的藝術—本來，誰也在懷疑適應讀者需要的東西，尚且時間經濟恐慌，被迫停刊；這種專求技巧的美（？），忽視了現實的東西，反能支持下去嗎？問題就在這裏了。架空而技巧的美的東西，對讀者的影響是：沖淡抗戰意識！這是誰也不容否認的吧？因此，我對於所謂「純文藝」的這類東西，起了極大的疑慮，也就是非立判了。</p>
<p>對個人主義者要「反」，對無視現實而侈談藝術者更應反，這並不是機械的論定，因為個人主義者與死抓住超現實的藝術論者的造成，決不是偶然的事。既不偶然，你就休想「說服」，更談不到「爭取」了。</p>
<p>倒也是事實如此，少數的作家們，已從統一戰綫回步到個人主義的領域去了，這決不是「事出有因，查無實據」的事。我們既明瞭對抗戰現階段將發生怎樣的影響，不僅是消極的對之「不恭」，而更須積極的「反」才好！</p>

<h3 id="c169">紅鬼子瓦西卡 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 高爾基著　狄周譯</p>
<p>『打碎玻璃？嘿，我會呌你把碎玻璃喫下去呀！』哇卡西說。</p>
<p>這頑抗的女人一聽到這話，也只好趕快跑到瓦西卡身邊去了。要是那女的還想挨延，他便自己走上去，扭她的頭髮，把她捽倒地板上。而她的姊妹們，--那怕和她頂要好的也不得不來縛她的腳，堵住她的嘴，就在她們眼前那廚房的地板上，鞭打起這有罪的人來。要是遇著一個喜歡對人訴苦的大膽的女子，那末爲了不打開她的皮，他就用寬大的皮鞭，隔一唇用水浸過的厚棉絮，鞭打她，使她身上不留青痕。此外，他還用一個滿裝著沙和砂粒的長細布袋，--用這樣的布袋去打她的臀部，使她感到一種悶痛，這種痛楚是會爬在肉上老久不退的，…………</p>
<p>但用刑重不重，要看女的罪名和瓦西卡的同情程度，無關於犯人的性格。有時候，就是大膽的女子，他業不留情的鞭打。他的褲袋裏老裝著三條尾巴鑲著，因常常使用而發光的橡樹把手的皮鞭。這皮鞭很巧妙地嵌著許多鐵絲，鞭紐尖頭把鐵絲的尾巴絞成一圈。第一下就會打得皮開肉綻，直打進骨裏去。而且爲了增加她們的痛苦，他還常常把芥末塗在打破的背脊上，或者在傷口覆上一塊浸透濃厚鹽水的抹布。</p>
<p>他懲罰姑娘們一點不焦急，總是孤獨的沉著臉，冷靜的動作。他的眼睛永遠露著無厭的，貪戀的表情。只是瞬眼時，便不知怎的變得更黑了。</p>
<p>刑罰的花樣，還不僅限於這點。不，這類花樣瓦西卡是有無限的。懲處妓女他的修養是達到了造化同工了。</p>
<p>有這樣一會事。一家窑子裏，有個叫做維娜·卡布特瓦的女子，受了偷嫖客五千盧布的嫌疑。那嫖客是新比科司的商人，他在警察局供稱：「曾和她及她的同伴莎拉·彌露曼一起在維娜房裏。莎拉坐了個把鐘頭便走了。只和維娜過了一夜，後來喝醉了酒，便離開她那兒。」</p>
<p>案子鬧到法院上，過了好久，兩個被告卻受了預訊，可是因為證據不充分，宣告無罪了。</p>
<p>裁判終結，回到羈押那兒的時候，兩人重括受了一次私訊。鴇母相信錢是她們偷的，她想自己分一份碱。</p>
<p>莎拉證明她和這次的偷竊案無關。老鴇就拼命喫住了維娜·卡布特瓦。把維娜鎖在浴室裏，許她吃鹽漬的鰻魚。但不管除此以外還用了其他許多方法，可是維娜總不說出錢藏在什麽地方。因此只好借助瓦西卡的手腕了。</p>
<p>鴇母同他們約好，如果他能哆迫這維娜的錢放在哪裡，便給他一子盧布。</p>
<p>於是有一天晚上，在為飢餓恐怖和險惡所困著的維娜坐著的浴宇裏，這惡魔出現了。</p>
<p>他披著黑色的毛蓬裏的毛皮，皮毛發著黃磷的氣味，和青色的光的煙。眼睛發著火一般的光，站在她的面前。用可怕的聲音詢問她：　（二）</p>

<h3 id="c170">聽言菊朋兩齣戲（上）　　—最贊成兩個字 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>言菊朋此番應聘黃金戲院，號曰舊譚派，第一日演空城計，賣座之盛，幾乎空前，顧曲界對於言氏，歡迎之殷，可以見矣。卑人忝列同　，義當往聽，於第三日日戲洪洋洞亦往焉。聽罷歸來，夜不能寐，展轉思維，加以分析，欲筆之於書，昭告同好，而此中委曲，言之甚長，吾今無暇為長言，萬不得已，於每一劇中各尋得一字，為字雖祗兩個，而關係甚大，即空城計中流水板之「賊」字，洪洋洞中出場元板之「閒」字是也。</p>
<p>空城計第一場下場時唱「先帝爺……也免得我親自去把賊收，」之「賊」字，入聲歸陽平聲，若照湖廣音低出之例，以唱此字無不糟者，其糟在使腔不圓，與上一字把字腔，陰陽（此陰陽係腔調方面）不會，病名曰「塌」如造屋然，夫造屋之牆壁支柱，無弗堅挺者，弗堅挺則屋塌；唱之腔調亦如此，某字不堅，或不響，或不高，則全句之腔倒塌。凡精唱法者，最要明此理，不明此理，而徒胡亂講究字音陰陽，是猶初出茅廬之「戾把」而已，真知音者必竊笑於其旁矣。老譚（鑫培）真是行家，確有師傅，唱此字時，不唱低出之音，在「宮譜」是上字，非合字，蓋源出崑曲，字宗中州故也。（此句之上句，「掃平賊寇」之賊字用「尺上上」亦是此理，）陳彥衡先生知其然，傳授吾等如此，謹記之不敢忘，吾又曾私自研究此「賊」字，確須如此唱法，毫無疑義，即令起程大老板於地下，吾亦敢固執此說，不稍猶疑焉。彼余叔岩亦曾執蟄於陳門者也，而於此「賊」字唱法，則不然矣，試聽叔岩所唱，賊字唱「合四」……之低音，彼是湖北人，用湖廣音之陽平聲低出之例唱此賊字，自以為有撥亂反正之功，其豈知反有佳人從賊之嫌閉門造車之妄哉！自叔岩而下之伶工，以及講究陰陽字音票友，無不唱此賊字為「合四」低音，大違老譚之唱法，即此一字之微，可以斷定學譚之偽與不偽，此一「賊」字之關係，豈不大歟！</p>

<p>（編者按）黃金義務戲是六月二十六·七日貼演的，迂堂玉泓兩先生的劇評，排好了多天，因文稿擁擠，直至今日始能刊出，還請兩位先生原諒。</p>
<p>昨晚黃金演義務戲，七時，予即入座作「早兄」。馮維德君知馬力開鑼，因屬墊戲，祗唱一場，嗓暗而饒韻味，學周有是處。馮下而傅雲苔小姐魚腸劍登場，劇為少卿先生所授，且親為操琴，自是不凡，其行腔咬字，有古色古香之致，傅小姐未嘗不可奪小冬之席而代之，幸於臉上身上多着意焉。繼以歐壽南君之棒打，是劇為歐之得意作，滬人尤渴望已久，全劇演足八刻，台下都屏息以聆，無喧嘩者。歐之扮相姣好，京白流利，嗓音甜潤，行腔新穎，顧予獨覺其表情方面有五點過人處，值得一寫：（一）金松呌莫稽走時，通常金玉奴說：「你給我回來！」歐於此處，開門作畏寒狀，說：「好大雪呀！」隱示攔阻之意，恰合閨女身份。（二）詢知莫稽是本城秀才，急告其父，含羞情態，極合劇情。（三）莫稽得中，驟變倨傲，金玉奴內心痛苦，強行忍受，表情逼真，（四）上船之際，被莫稽搶先推開，先擬跳江，後欲回轉，末以金松年老，忍氣登舟，一種悲憤欲絕神情，令人感動。（五）跪求義父憐念，極纏綿悱惻之致。觀其表情之細膩週到，頗覺其成名之非倖致也。莊小谷之莫稽，李在田之金松，俱各稱職。壓軸為曾心齋君之賣馬當鐧，曾君原定劇碼為全本空城計，嗣以時間不敷分配，改唱賣馬，復以為時過晏，自願略去鐧，其戲德　是多者。唱做酷肖菊朋，店主東一段，合座擊節，搖板亦中細墨。頗聞曾君要鐧有獨到處，以未獲一覩，不得不怪罪於當日戲提調之疏忽從事也。大軸蕭明小姐之得意緣，臨時以江世玉替顧傳玠去盧昆杰，意願自知不善京白而藏拙耶，然而大勢已去，雖有芙蓉草，亦無可挽回矣。時晏雨大，離座而歸。</p>

<p>粵語片準備與西片爭勝　彭飛黎灼灼任男女主角</p>
<p>好萊塢銀幕上的「泰山」獲得了千千萬萬影迷的擁護，自「人猿泰山」一直到「泰山出險」，使影片公司老闆大大的轉了一筆錢。於是聰明的中國電影商人也預備來這麼一套，最近華南電影界，有人在籌備攝製「中國泰山」。</p>
<p>「大力士」彭飛，已被選定了担任「中國泰山」的男主角，不久以前彭飛曾到上海來過一次，他的任務有二，一是邀請李紅担任此片女主角，（外傳為白虹，實誤。）二是搬運道具。現在彭飛已回到香港去了！邀請李紅是沒有成功，第一是因為李紅與新華公司訂有合同，第二是李紅身材略嫌矮小，現在已改聘黎灼灼担任，由王次龍居間接洽成功。至於片中應用的道具，則已由彭飛隨帶到港，其中最引人矚目的是實心鐵担子，計大小五副，重量自一百磅至三百五十磅，這是彭飛作練習魄力之用的。</p>
<p>黎灼灼自於張冀分居後，反而消瘦了不少，日前香港中華除與友啤隊比賽棒球，黎灼灼亦高踞看台一席，雖然還是像從前一般的豪放，却不如從前那樣的健硬了。</p>

<p>上海難民救濟協會邀請本外埠名票演義賣劇，計兩晚中之公演劇目甚多，名票參加者亦甚多，而成績特異卓爾不羣者，有四齣焉：</p>
<p>第一晚許黑珍之六部大審，許專演冷戲，是劇已為現代名伶公認為絕不時髦之戲，而許君演來，有唱有念有做，雖僅一場而老練不殊內行，嗓音又復奇佳，佳作也。簫北翹之盜御馬。似宗法侯喜瑞，架子工穩，氣勢雄岸，念白口勁特佳，票友得此，確匪易易。第二晚蕭明女士之得意緣，簫女士在平本以唱做兼擅著，是晚得意緣，則獨重念白表情身段，故未能表演簫之全部藝術也。蕭明是晚一出臺之亮相，十分曼妙輕靈，非老於此道者，曷克臻此，念白清脆動問，字字如珠，做工表情，輕描淡寫，而自然工穩，其所表現，在海上坤伶及女票中，允推簫女士為傑出之才矣。是晚又輔以芙蓉草江世玉之綠葉，宜乎滿座擊節讚美也。曾心齋之藝，久著於九江南昌間，此番登場，唱念做作，靡不出色驚人，其臺步之佳，尤為海內名伶所不及，一曲歌來，暢快淋漓，惜未演全本空城計為憾也。（却酬）</p>

<p>金少山北上後大紅的原因</p>
<p>民國十九年　　語句　　路　　　時，　　　　抵滬，寶森因倒嗓尚未復元，深恐第一日打砲戲唱「捉放」時為少由所啃，（啃即內行所謂兩角同唱一戲時，彼此各不相讓，賣足嗓子，非將對方啃倒，使其甘拜下風不止，往往梨園行人說某人被某人啃扒下啦，即此之謂）。遂在拜客的時候，請我先向少山說情，是日少山與老元偕來，經余向金說明請其關照寶森之意後，彼立即說道：「我們的上人都是有交情的，當然不會作難他的。」席間大家都很高興，遂由金發起能唱者各歌一折，寶森唱罷，眾目皆集於少山之身，不想他也非常知機，不等眾人向他開口，他就向孫老說道：「老叔（秀山與老元係盟兄弟）請您拉一段我唱。」不侫見他爽快之極，絕無大角成名後忸怩作態的惡習，因亦說道：「你要唱，就得唱個大段，好讓我們過足戲癮，那末，就煩你來一段「刺僚」罷」。誰知他的「列國紛紛……」剛一出口，却把樓下廂房裏的兩個孩子嚇哭了；霎時孩子的父母全跑上樓來，伸頭探腦的向房裏直照看看是什麽人會有這般打雷似的嗓子，後來曉得是金少山了，也都鴉雀無聲的佇足以聽，並且認為是很不易得的機會呢。三日後荀楊登台，每逢少山與寶森合演「捉放」「空城」「法門寺」這一類戲，他總是壓低了調門，並且非俟寶森得了彩聲，他才偶爾要一回好，絕不搶在正角頭裏要彩，由此足見他是很重義氣，很講舊交的了。</p>
<p>提起他不忘舊交的話，我又想到那年浦東杜祠堂會的事了。當第一天我和李微五，葉庸方，鄭子　，程君謀諸君同去的時候，在後台碰見許多梨園朋友，一個個都是一榻橫陳忙着打足了氣好去扮戲，至於吃飯還是次要問題，因為內行原有「飽吹，餓唱，氣打鼓」，的這句話，所以戲沒唱完以前，是不亟亟於吃的。（五三）</p>

<p>— 辛士（筆錄）</p>
<p>對於電影工作的感想：這是我所該得努力的事業，當然希望逐次進步，能夠獲得極大的成功。但也以為它和年齡頗多關係，未必便能作為終身事業，關於努力求學的意念，因此也就來得更深切了。</p>
<p>這裏，我想談一些戀愛與婚姻的問題。真是笑話得很：不久以前，有某種刊物上說『路明的擇婿條件，須有跑馬廳那樣大的地皮，和一千萬的金鎊。』這玩笑開得並不打緊，但有許多女同學們在見面時，或打電話來詢問有無其詞的人却真不少；這般無中生有的謠言，該是多麼又氣又好笑的妙事。我的一貫主張，是反對談戀愛的，尤其在事業沒有成功以前，絕對不應該談什麽戀愛。另一種說法，談戀愛或許是有閒階級的事？我在一個半月拍一部戲的勞苦工作下，要想多作學業上的修養，精神還常嫌不夠，時間與經濟都不是一個有閒者，戀愛這兩個字，根本上便沒想到，怎會進一步談到婚姻和什麽條件，這豈不是笑話太甚了嗎？</p>
<p>末了，我以為有些人對於電影演員們，認為一般都是習於浪漫生活與享樂主義者，這樣浮面觀察，其實是很不對的。就我自己來說：我現在的生活仍與學生時期一般無殊，我就在嚴肅的規律上，從沒有過稍微逾分的企想，從沒有過稍微逾分的行事。（完）</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Japanese air force and artillery units have jointly bombed Shuijiang near Fuzhou for two days, but have still not been able to gain a foothold in Shuijiang. The Chinese troops along the Fujian coast are now putting up the strongest resistance against the Japanese army. The people of all cities, including Fuzhou, are extremely calm and show no signs of panic or disorder. Observers point out that it will not be easy for the Japanese army to land in Fuzhou after the arrival of Chinese reinforcements. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign dispatches report that the Japanese side claims it will block the Min River estuary starting on the 6th, and orders foreign nationals and ships to withdraw from Fuzhou before that date. It is rumored that the Japanese will launch an attack with land and air forces at dawn on the 6th. Foreign nationals there are requesting that Nantai Island be designated as an international security zone. After several negotiations, Japan has agreed to respect this, but declares that it will not be responsible for stray bullets or fragments flying into the area. (Special dispatch, 5th afternoon) The Japanese side dispatched Guangzhou Consul Matsudaira, who forcibly took over the Chinese Swatow Customs at 3 PM on the 5th. (Special dispatch, 5th afternoon)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman announced today that Japan has dispatched the 5th New Army Division to China. However, he believes that this new army is not a reinforcement for any large-scale offensive planned in China, and is probably only a defense deployment. The spokesman continued that since the Japanese army failed in its seven attacks on Zhongtiaoshan in southern Shanxi, it has twice invaded the mountain in a short period of time, but has been severely damaged and retreated each time. The spokesman finally mentioned the military actions in southern China, saying that the Chinese army has repeatedly attacked in the Xinhui and Jiangmen areas south of Guangzhou, and Chinese mobile units have attacked Japanese positions in various areas. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman, the Japanese army in China has increased to 40 divisions in the past month (but according to the Associated Press and other sources, it is only 36 divisions). The increased divisions total seven, but most of the increased forces are still concentrated along the railways, with two and a half divisions added to Shanxi and one division added to Hubei. The other divisions are merely replenishing losses. Therefore, except for Shanxi, where the Japanese army may launch another offensive against the guerrillas, they do not believe there will be any new offensives in other areas.

<p>(Chongqing) Yesterday was American Independence Day. Dr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Executive Yuan of China, broadcast to America in English, saying, "I cannot help but express my regret at this time when the international situation is clouded with gloom and various principles contained in the American Declaration of Independence are threatened everywhere. However, your country's struggle for independence has given us unparalleled lessons. As we enter the third year of this Chinese war of national independence, we recall the spirit of your country's martyrs who fought bloody battles to win independence and lay the foundation for freedom and equality for future generations. We are deeply encouraged and excited. I sincerely hope that when peace descends upon the world and goodwill reaches the masses, we will see our two great sister nations across the Pacific rejoice in the steadfastness of their democracies in the world. Furthermore, the birth of the North American Republic is a cause for joy for all who love freedom. The American Declaration of Independence not only proclaimed the highest principles of human freedom and equality, but also created a great nation with lofty ideals, whose contributions to human progress and world peace are unmatched by any other country. Such as the elucidation of the Open Door Policy, the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty, the signing of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and other achievements in the international arena, all of which were led by your country. At the same time, since the outbreak of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan, the United States has provided considerable assistance to China, such as purchasing Chinese silver and providing loans to China. Now, in our infinite pain and tragic resistance, your country extends infinite sympathy and spiritual assistance, and establishes various wartime relief service works and active cooperation actions for our people. We deeply know that your country's sympathy for China stems purely from the similarity of the ideals and the consistency of the interests of the two great nations. The United States has always loved China consistently, whether in trade, education, culture, politics, or international relations, the United States has always been a friend and teacher of China. Therefore, China's love for the United States is not accidental. However, at present, reason is replaced by barbaric force, and the sanctity of all treaties can be trampled upon by militarists. Kong continued, Japan may implement its policy of military terror against China, but it will never deter our will, and will never subdue the national soul of China, but will only strengthen our determination to resist. Our resistance has now reached two full years, and the myth of the invincibility of the Imperial Army has been exposed by us. From now on, we will continue to resist, regardless of the years, until Japan knows that our China cannot be conquered, and until China becomes an independent and free country. However, maintaining international law and justice is not a matter for one country alone. Furthermore, in order to protect the interests of one country, we must not be like ostriches, hiding our heads in the sand when we see disasters. Therefore, America's peace and security will ultimately be inextricably linked to the peace and security of the world. If we want to enjoy the happiness of peace, we must work for peace; if we want to ensure our own security, we must pay the price for security. Here, I would like those isolationists in your country to reflect: although Japan is a warlike country, it is also a country that cannot be self-sufficient in resources. In this war of aggression against China, its munitions raw materials and killing weapons are all obtained from other countries, especially the United States. This is Japan's weakness and also the greatest reason why the American people can stop the insatiable demands of this island nation. In short, the economic power of the American people is much greater than all the power of Japan. Therefore, if the United States can impose economic pressure on Japan at this time, Japan's clay feet will inevitably lead to failure. In short, the United States has the power to subdue Japan without war and stop Japan's policy of aggression. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>

<p>Since May, there have been constant reports of conflicts on the border between Mongolia and "Manchukuo," and Japan has even exaggerated the "great victory in air combat" in the international community. According to recent news, the conflict seems to be gradually escalating. The Japanese Embassy in the United Kingdom officially published an official gazette in London yesterday, announcing the implementation of a "defensive" counterattack starting on July 1st; at the same time, Tokyo newspapers are also vigorously publicizing the tension in Japanese-Soviet relations; it is even said that due to the successive recall of the Soviet ambassador and chargé d'affaires to Japan, the diplomatic relations between the two countries have been virtually severed, indicating that a Japanese-Soviet war may be imminent.</p>
<p>This border conflict between Mongolia and "Manchukuo" is exactly the same as the Zhanggufeng Incident last spring, and again originated from the so-called border crossing incident; but which side crossed the border first will become an unsolvable mystery. However, the cause of the conflict is one thing, and the evolution of the conflict into a formal war is another. Whoever wants to provoke can use the border crossing incident as an excuse: judging from the official gazette issued by the Japanese Embassy in the United Kingdom, although it tries to attribute the responsibility for the border crossing to the Soviet-Mongolian army; it also claims that it has sent air force to bomb Outer Mongolian territory, and openly declares that it will take offensive measures on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Provocation is one thing, and whether the provoker has the ability and determination to fight is naturally another. A Japanese-Soviet war is indeed inevitable: Japan must eliminate Soviet power in the Far East to complete its continental policy: the Soviet Union also knows that to protect the integrity of its territory, it must correct Japan's attempt to dominate the Far East. In terms of the current situation, the military deployments of the two countries have reached a serious stage of tension; but this is only the superficial situation: in fact, Japan has no ability or determination to fight against the Soviet Union during the period of its invasion of China. Japan's war against China has now lasted two years, and it is exhausted and unable to stop; its domestic troops are not enough to be distributed on various battlefields in China, so how can it launch a large-scale attack on the Soviet Union? In terms of economy, although Japan has implemented the General Mobilization Law, it still cannot afford the cost of invading China, so how can it raise financial resources that are greater than the cost of invading China? As for Japan's determination to launch a war against the Soviet Union: if Japan really wanted to fight the Soviet Union to the death, then the military and economic power that Japan maintained a year ago was far superior to the current one, and it would not have bowed its knees in the middle of the Zhanggufeng Incident a year ago. Another very obvious point is that Japan does not want this conflict to occur on the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border, but on the Mongolian-"Manchukuo" border, which is to try to avoid a head-on conflict with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Japan does not have the ability and determination to fight against the Soviet Union, and this creation of the Mongolian-Manchukuo conflict has the effect of "killing two birds with one stone." One is for domestic political purposes: since Japan's war against China, from the Konoe Cabinet to the Hiranuma Cabinet, the Japanese warlords have always considered them weak and incompetent: especially for the exclusion of European and American forces in China, they have not been able to take decisive measures, and they have refused to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy, which has greatly disappointed them. They attempt to use the expansion of the scope of operations as an excuse to organize a military cabinet dominated by pure military personnel in order to fulfill their dreams of aggression. The recent rumors that a cabinet crisis is about to occur in Japan are probably a sign of this effect.</p>
<p>The other effect is to cope with the international situation and take a feigned attack in diplomacy; its greatest purpose is to destroy the establishment of the tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and to respond to Germany's recent posture toward Danzig in Europe. The negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have gradually approached completion. If the tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is established, regardless of whether it involves the Far East issue, they will inevitably have more opportunities and power to pay attention to the Far East due to the stability of the European situation. In order to avoid being interfered with, Japan is using the Mongolian-Manchukuo conflict to publicize the weakness of the Soviet military, so that Britain and France will shake their determination to unite with the Soviet Union. Japan has previously publicized that the Japanese Air Force has shot down dozens or even hundreds of Soviet aircraft in multiple battles with a small number of aircraft. Who dares to believe this lightly! Recently, Japan has insisted on publishing the details of the Mongolian-Manchukuo conflict in London's official gazette, which clearly exposes its true intentions. As for Japan's deliberately creating a tense situation in the Far East in response to Germany, this is a consistent policy of Eurasian fascism; they attempt to divert the British and French forces' aid to Poland due to the serious situation in the Far East, which is of course another act of echoing Germany from afar.</p>
<p>Those who are clever in the world often end up outsmarting themselves. Japan's Mongolian-Manchukuo conflict will make Britain, France, and the Soviet Union feel the same pressure and quickly promote the establishment of a tripartite mutual assistance agreement. Recently, Paris and London have revealed optimistic news about the negotiations. Furthermore, due to Japan's actions in response to Germany, it is enough to make Britain, France, and the Soviet Union realize that the world's security has no regional boundaries. The Far East is certainly no exception!</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Political Parties Resolve to Urge the Government to Take a Strong Stance on the Tokyo-British Negotiations; Must Make Britain Accept the Conditions Proposed by the Tianjin Japanese Authorities; Sugiyama Claims That Restrictions on Transportation in Tianjin Will Not Be Relaxed in the Slightest <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that various political parties and public organizations are holding meetings one after another to pass resolutions urging the government to adopt a strong attitude towards the Tokyo-British conference to resolve the Tianjin Incident. The Masses Party followed in the footsteps of the Minseito Party and the Seiyukai Party and held an emergency board meeting this morning. It is reported that a resolution has been passed stating that the British aid to the Chinese Chiang Kai-shek regime is a serious obstacle in the construction of the new order in East Asia, and urging the government to implement the four conditions that the Tianjin Japanese authorities have submitted to the British authorities to resolve the Tianjin Incident. It is also reported that this resolution has been copied and sent to Prime Minister Hiranuma and the three ministers of the Navy, Army, and Foreign Affairs. The Tokyo City Council and various prefectural councils also passed resolutions this afternoon, strongly requesting the government to force Britain to obey public opinion, abandon its pro-Chiang policy, so as to eliminate the source of disputes in the Tokyo negotiations, and copied the resolution and presented it to five major cabinet members and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) General Sugiyama, commander of the Japanese army in North China, arrived here from Peiping yesterday to personally investigate the Tianjin situation, and returned to Peiping this morning. According to Japanese newspapers, General Sugiyama strongly urged the British concession authorities to abandon their pro-Chiang attitude and cooperate with Japan to create a new order in Asia. After inspecting the Japanese inspection stations at the entrances and exits of the British and French concessions, Sugiyama met with reporters yesterday afternoon. When asked about his feelings after personally inspecting, Sugiyama said that the Japanese soldiers were performing their duties of isolating the British and French concessions earnestly and calmly, and the Chinese and Japanese residents of Tianjin gave solid support to the Japanese military authorities, which he was very pleased with. When reporters asked about his opinions on the Tokyo-British talks, Sugiyama replied that no matter how the British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo proceed, the restrictions on transportation in Tianjin will not be relaxed in the slightest. The isolation of the British and French concessions in Tianjin is implemented under the guidance of the Japanese army in North China. The Japanese army is determined to achieve its goals and will not heed any interference until Britain changes its pro-Chiang attitude and policy of protecting anti-Japanese and communist elements. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) When reporters questioned the Japanese spokesperson today about the Japanese rumor that British Consul-General Jameson in Tianjin had recently obtained the planned plans of the Chinese guerrillas fighting in the Tianjin area, the spokesperson promised to reply tomorrow. According to Consul-General Jameson, he had already asked Reuters yesterday to deny this statement, which he described as absurd nonsense. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Nagai, the leader of the Minseito Party, delivered a speech at a rally against Britain, believing that the main condition for the British-Japanese negotiations should be to require Britain to immediately end its support for the Chinese Nationalist government. Nagai criticized the Far East policy adopted by Britain since the Opium War in very harsh terms, and demanded that the entire Japanese people unanimously regard Britain as an enemy, and that the Japanese people should hate Britain unless Britain changes its attitude.

<p>Craigie Explains the Scope of Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Craigie, who was ordered to conduct British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, solemnly stated to reporters today that the negotiations held in Tokyo this time will be limited to local issues caused by the Tianjin Incident. Since both Britain and Japan have expressed goodwill, the prospects for the negotiations can be viewed optimistically. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Craigie told 15 foreign reporters at the embassy today that there is a firm understanding that the British-Japanese negotiations, which will begin soon, will deal with local issues related to the current situation in Tianjin. This dispute can only be resolved through negotiations, and not by force. The official opening date of the talks has not yet been determined. The Japanese military representative in Tianjin was unable to return home by plane due to bad weather and had to take a train and ship to get here, so the opening date of the meeting has been delayed. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler spoke about the situation in Tianjin, saying that there was no new situation to report. "Before the end of the negotiations in Tokyo, there will be no discussion of the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case in Tianjin. I have already stated this." (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>British MPs Advocate a Strong Stance</p>
<p>(London) Last night, the 1912 Club, composed of members of parliament from various parties in the Lower House, held a meeting. Mr. Tom Peifel, a former China correspondent of the Manchester Guardian, and Mr. Kirkbride Lake, who represented the British government's Export Credit Guarantee Department in China in 1936, delivered speeches on the current situation in China. Both men have a wealth of knowledge about Chinese affairs. He said that the Tianjin Incident was only a kind of testing effect. If Britain shows any surrender to Japan on this matter, it will terminate the possibility of cooperation with the United States in the Far East or Europe in the long term, because the United States' willingness to stand on the same side as Britain in the Far East and Europe will depend on whether Britain is prepared to take a firm stand. Kirkbride said that the Japanese warlords have failed to end this undeclared war and present it to their countrymen as a trophy, which has made Japanese business, finance, and civilians feel disappointed. He believes that this war in China is purely a military rebellion. This undeclared war will end with an undeclared peace. At that time, Britain will feel that it is not easy to preserve its efforts to trade with China and will see it become even more serious. The way Britain is organized will have to change, and Britain's entire attitude towards the policies of the Japanese military authorities should also be firm. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, a member asked whether Britain would continue to provide assistance to Chinese legal tender. Financial Secretary Simon replied immediately, "For the sake of Britain's own interests, and for the sake of the interests of other countries that have economic and financial relations with China, the stability of Chinese legal tender is valued by the government. I see no reason to change this view." Opposition Labour MP Bergen raised a question, "When the government previously proposed the Chinese Currency Stabilization Act, it advocated maintaining the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender. Now that the exchange rate of legal tender has fallen by 25 percent, does the government still maintain it?" Financial Secretary Simon replied that the stability of Chinese legal tender is of paramount importance, which I have already said, but it is not appropriate to describe what measures we will take in the future. Bergen then followed up with a question, "Is the government continuing to maintain the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender? Is the Financial Secretary prepared to allocate sufficient resources for this?" The Financial Secretary replied, "The government has taken this action through legislative procedures. What we will do in the future is not convenient to announce at this time." (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of The Times commented today on the British-Japanese negotiations that will be held in Tokyo, saying that Japanese newspapers and soldiers are still repeatedly exaggerating methods to make the British support Japanese currency in North China and acquiesce to Japanese aggression. If Japan proposes the above points, the Tokyo conference may not make much progress. The British government is now prepared to guarantee Japan the neutrality of the British concession in Tianjin and the immediate extradition of the four suspects if they are proven guilty. In addition, other local incidents will be discussed, but beyond this limit, the British government does not intend to proceed. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to the Japanese spokesperson's announcement to reporters this morning, the second mate of the Taikoo Yangxing Yuezhou ship, British national Griffith, who was arrested on Sunday evening, will be released today. The reason for his arrest was that he used insulting language to Japanese soldiers. However, when I went to Taikoo Yangxing this morning to inquire, Griffith had not yet returned to the ship. A reporter asked what the Japanese intended by tightening restrictions on the transportation of milk into the British concession. The spokesperson replied that according to the officer in charge of the search office, there is no other way to inspect items that have not been allowed to be transported in except to inspect the containers in which they are packed. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) US Consul in Tianjin Gottway lodged a protest with Japanese Consul Tashiro today, listing various inconveniences suffered by Americans. Tashiro has agreed to do his best to reduce the troubles of American residents, and said that the Japanese side now has a type of cargo transportation license, which Americans can obtain from the Japanese side if they want to transport goods in and out of the concession.

<h3 id="e8">Continued Air Battles on the Outer Mongolian Border: Information Released by Tokyo <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This question was received today from a Japanese report: Yesterday, when the Japanese army attempted to expel the Soviet army from the border of "Manchukuo," Soviet Outer Mongolian aircraft clashed with Japanese "Manchukuo" aircraft in the skies of the Outer Mongolian border twice. According to the Japanese side, as a result of the air battle, 64 Soviet aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft. The Japanese report did not mention how many Japanese aircraft were lost. It is said that the first air battle took place in the western section of the border yesterday afternoon. A team of Soviet bombers flew close to the Japanese aviation base and dropped dozens of bombs aimlessly. Japanese fighter planes then took off to intercept them, shooting down 14 Soviet aircraft. Before dusk, 90 Soviet aircraft were said to have crossed the border to an area 40 miles east of Lake Baikal. An hour-long air battle there resulted in the loss of 50 Soviet aircraft. The Japanese report also said that since last week, the number of Soviet aircraft in Outer Mongolia has increased. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the communique here, since May 20, an average of as many as eight Soviet-Mongolian aircraft have been shot down by the Japanese side. From May 20 to July 4, a total of 365 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft have been shot down, of which 283 were shot down before June 27. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Philippine Democratic Collective Congress Passes Resolution Condemning Japan, Launches Boycott Movement, and Sends Respectful Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Manila) The Democratic Collective Security Congress was held at the Manila Theater last night and passed a resolution to condemn Japan's aggression against China and urge all parties to boycott Japanese goods. The Congress also sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of China, outlining the Congress's plans. Simultaneously, telegrams were sent to President Roosevelt and Sir Samuel, president of the International Peace Movement Association. The telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated, "The Congress unanimously expresses its most enthusiastic respect to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. It is determined to provide economic assistance to the united front of the Chinese people's resistance against Japanese fascist aggression, and will launch a movement to boycott Japanese goods." The telegram to President Roosevelt stated, "The Philippine Democratic Collective Security Congress expresses its utmost admiration for your public leadership in the movement for democracy and collective security, but the Congress believes that the most important thing is still to boycott Japanese goods and prohibit the supply of armaments to aggressors." The telegram to Sir Samuel stated, "The Philippine Democratic Collective Security Congress condemns all forms of aggression worldwide." The Congress also passed a resolution to urge all democratic countries of the world to implement a boycott of Japanese goods as soon as possible. In addition to Christian Filipinos and Muslim Filipinos, hundreds of thousands of people participated in the Congress. The Congress also received many congratulatory messages from Chinese military and political figures, such as Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, Chief of the Political Department of the General Headquarters Chen Cheng, and Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council Zhang Qun.

<p>(Manila) The Philippine Republic Association, which advocates for an indefinite postponement of Philippine independence, is intensifying its work. It recently has 3,000 members. Due to the tense situation in the Far East, the association's members have become more active. However, due to limited funds, the number of personnel sent to the provinces for publicity is small. According to the association's main personnel, US-Philippine cooperation is the only effective tool to safeguard the Philippines against foreign aggression. (May 5, Associated Press)</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul's Frustration</p>
<p>(Manila) The Japanese Consul in Manila, Kihara, expressed his dissatisfaction today with the boycott of Japanese goods and anti-Japanese resolutions passed at the Democratic Collective Security Congress held at the Manila Theater last night. He believes that it "greatly hinders the existing good relations between Japan and the Philippines, and this resolution is completely contrary to the neutral policy announced by the Philippine President. I do not understand why non-Philippine people support this resolution that contradicts the government's policy." The Mayor of Manila, Posadas, has handed several copies of the Congress's resolution to the City Prosecutor's Office to study whether the resolution violates the Mayor's permit and the status of the Philippines, and then decide whether to initiate public prosecution. According to the Police Department, various anti-Japanese slogans were found on the walls of the Manila Theater. (May 5, Associated Press)</p>

The purpose of this plan is to encourage production and exports, eliminate extravagance, and maintain the foreign exchange market. It hopes that friendly countries will provide China with what it needs more and what it does not need less. (May 5, Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) Soviet sources here stated today that the final conclusion of the three-way anti-aggression pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is in sight. (May 5, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Responsible parties here have expressed disagreement with overseas reports that the three-way anti-aggression pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has essentially been completed and will soon be signed. Although there is reason to believe that the negotiations have made progress, there is no sign of a resolution to the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic countries. Informed sources generally believe that the recent response from the Soviet Foreign Minister contains several counter-proposals that require further discussion. (May 5, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet government submitted a response to the suggestions from Britain and France on the 3rd of this month, the content of which is no less than expanding the scope of the mutual assistance agreement to include Poland and Turkey, becoming a five-nation agreement. The Soviet Union is also willing to accept the guarantee of independence for the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, but only on the condition that Poland and Turkey provide the same guarantee to the Soviet Union. In addition, the Soviet government also proposes that the mutual assistance measures should be automatically implemented if a country guaranteed by any of the related countries is subjected to aggression or suffers a "threat of aggression." According to informed sources here, the British government will provide a response to the Soviet Union within 48 hours. (May 5, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the latest Soviet counter-proposal has two key points. One is that the mutual assistance measures should be automatically implemented when any country guaranteed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is subjected to aggression or suffers a threat of aggression. A certain party here recently provided an explanation of the so-called "threat of aggression," believing that Germany used threats against Austria and Czechoslovakia in the past. Although there were no signs of aggression, the actual aggression was undeniable. This type of strategy is well-known to the world, and resolving this point should not be difficult. The second key point is that Poland and Turkey should provide guarantees to the Soviet Union. It is hoped that Turkey will accept this, but Poland may explicitly express disagreement. Therefore, consultations with Poland must take place before a response can be given to the Soviet Union. (May 15, Havas)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the Soviet side's response to the new suggestions from Britain and France was personally delivered by Foreign Minister Molotov to the British and French ambassadors yesterday. According to informed sources here, the Soviet government proposed certain counter-proposals in its response, but they were not of a mandatory nature, so negotiations should continue. The focus of the discussion at this point is the following two points: one is the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic coastal countries by Britain and France, and the other is the issue of providing guarantees to Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands by the Soviet Union. Regarding the first point, the Soviet side believes that since mutual assistance measures should be automatically and unconditionally implemented when any country guaranteed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is subjected to aggression, the same should apply when the guaranteed countries are subjected to a threat of aggression. Regarding the second point, the Soviet side reportedly stated that since the country does not maintain normal diplomatic relations with Switzerland and the Netherlands, the discussion of guarantees may be difficult to implement.

<h3 id="e14">British Newspaper Commentary <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondents of various newspapers here commented today on the negotiations for the three-way pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, all stating that there are still many difficulties in the negotiations regarding the expansion of guarantees. Britain has accepted the Soviet request to guarantee the three Baltic countries, but attached the condition that the Soviet Union guarantee the Netherlands and Switzerland. The Times stated in its editorial today that it is not appropriate to force any country to join the guarantee system against its will. Since the three major guarantor countries of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have declared their readiness to undertake mutual assistance obligations, they should immediately sign a mutual assistance treaty. At the same time, Britain and France may use their diplomatic skills to persuade the Baltic countries, for their own best interests, to conclude alliances with the three non-aggressor countries. (May 5, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) According to the views of some diplomatic correspondents in London, although Britain has agreed to the Soviet request to guarantee Finland, Latvia, and Estonia against aggression, the Soviet Union refuses to guarantee the Netherlands and Switzerland. This is the latest obstacle to the Moscow negotiations. The Daily Express reported that the British dispatched a note to the Soviet Union last time, stating that Britain could guarantee the Soviet Union's back door neighbors, but the guarantees of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, in addition to applying to the six countries that Britain and France have already guaranteed, Poland, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, and Portugal, must also extend to the Netherlands and Switzerland. The News Chronicle stated that Britain's argument is that if guarantees are given to countries on one side of the German border, then guarantees must also be given to countries on the other side of the border. Therefore, new obstacles have arisen in the negotiations. The Daily Mail also made this statement, adding that the government is gradually feeling that the Soviet Union intends to delay the negotiations, with the aim of undermining Prime Minister Chamberlain's position. If this is indeed the case, then the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, will make some clear statements. Supporters of the government had eagerly hoped for the early establishment of a British-French-Soviet pact, but now they are becoming tired of this repeated and seemingly endless delay. Some members of the House of Commons now say that this pact could have been issued.</p>

<p>(Paris) The Anglo-French Friendship Association held its annual banquet tonight. Those present included British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and many dignitaries from both countries. Secretary of War Hore-Belisha gave a speech at the banquet, first recounting the process of the establishment of the Anglo-French Entente, stating that it was initiated by the late British King Edward VII and the late French President Loubet. "At that time, Edward VII once said that the closer the relationship between Britain and France, the deeper their understanding and friendship, and the more solid the fortress of civilization will be. Looking back now, this statement was indeed prescient. Although our two countries were deeply fraternal during the European War, they were not completely close to each other. When encountering recently occurring events, although the goals of Britain and France were the same in the past, the paths they took were different. France was committed to the creation of an alliance system, while Britain opposed the organization of such a system. In fact, France's policy was based on past experiences to prepare for future needs. After the incidents that have occurred, it can be seen that France's learning from the past is something that we must agree with. Moreover, in the midst of all difficulties, France sought to revive its political finances, never abandoning its freedom and rights, and ultimately succeeded. This is what we admire most. In addition, due to the changes in the world situation, Britain and France, based on a common spirit, have established the same policies and understanding. The two countries are now entering a new historical period together, and the people of both countries are especially able to abide by discipline, endure sacrifices, and face it with great wisdom and courage. Because the goals and policies of the two countries have now converged, the depth and binding force of the Entente are also unprecedented. Moreover, our two countries are now being provoked, the nature of which need not be elaborated. In short, when necessary, we must resolutely and decisively deal with it together. This point should be made known to the world. I still remember that when General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff of the French National Defense, recently visited Britain, he visited the parade of our country's army. On the 14th of this month (that is, the French National Day), Lieutenant General Gort, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army, will also come to visit the parade of the French army. At that time, there will also be British army units participating. Between Britain and France, there is no longer any military secret. All kinds of intelligence, knowledge, and experience are exchanged as much as possible. In short, the friendship between comrades is as one in life and death." Secretary of War Hore-Belisha then praised the strength of the French army, saying that its training is well-established and unmatched throughout the world. As for the British army, the number of regular troops and auxiliary members can be increased to one million by July 1940 and will continue to increase. Regarding the air force, judging from the current production status of Britain and France, it is certain that they can maintain the most modern and highest quality air force. In addition to this, the two countries also possess valuable assets in spirit, that is, our belief in living standards and human values can also constitute a weapon, which is stronger than steel. In short, our strength is strong and we must always be united."</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Bonnet then stood up and gave a reply, stating briefly that the Anglo-French Entente is very close and there is absolutely no gap for anyone to suspect. The two great nations of Britain and France have been united, and the two great empires have also been cooperating closely. All the interests they possess and the truths they all recognize as obvious and undeniable must be jointly maintained. Britain and France have vast territories and large populations, and their governments have a duty to the independence and dignity of the nations. They must not allow any country or group of countries to carry out their plan to control Europe. In addition, they must jointly shoulder the responsibility of maintaining world peace, so that no nation will live in fear every day, fearing that its borders will be invaded. Regarding this point, we now use our entire strength to back it up, and we are willing to clearly state this purpose. In short, Britain and France are now working together to enhance peace and enable everyone to have security. That's all." He then mentioned the implementation of the conscription system in Britain and concluded by saying, "After Britain and France join forces, what can they do? Or it may not be fully understood by the world. It is important to know that the purpose of our cooperation is to maintain the security of all countries. Knowing that there must be many thorns ahead, but with the deep friendship and strong strength of Britain and France, we are confident that we will be able to overcome it." (May 4, Havas)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov arrived here at 2:30 PM today. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and most of the dignitaries were at the station to welcome him. (May 5, Havas)</p>
<p>Sofia: The visit of Prime Minister Koseivanov to Germany has been commented on by various newspapers, which said that the political significance of this trip is still limited, but it is of great significance in terms of economy. Government officials stated that Prime Minister Koseivanov will absolutely not accept restrictions in politics, nor will he sign any agreement, but he will discuss with the German authorities various issues related to the Balkan Peninsula. Generally, the German side will mention Bulgaria's territorial demands (the Dobruja region of Romania and the Thermaic Gulf region of Greece, both of which belonged to Bulgaria before the European War). However, Germany's ambition in the Balkan Peninsula is to control it freely, especially Bulgaria. Therefore, it may not be eager to satisfy Bulgaria's territorial demands. This is also known to the Bulgarian government, so it also takes a restrained attitude towards Germany. In addition, when Prime Minister Koseivanov returns to his country from Berlin, he will pass through the capital of Yugoslavia and will stay for a short time, which shows the close relationship between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. (May 5, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Political figures here are commenting on the fact that Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov will visit Italy after visiting Germany, saying that the German and Italian authorities will definitely use all kinds of methods to lure Bulgaria into joining the Berlin-Rome Axis. At this time, the newspapers of these countries have already begun to publicize, in addition to exaggerating the close relations between Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria, they are also promoting Bulgaria's territorial demands (the Dobruja region of Romania and the Thermaic Gulf region of Greece, which belonged to Bulgaria before the European War) to an even greater extent than Bulgaria's own wishes. The goal of this propaganda campaign is to resist any initiative from Britain and France in the Balkan Peninsula. As for Bulgaria, although the Balkan Entente countries have repeatedly invited it to participate in the Entente group, the country has not agreed to join because Romania and Greece have refused to accept Bulgaria's territorial demands. Therefore, the propaganda of Germany and Italy is naturally sweet to Bulgaria's ears. Especially after Italy's continuous increase of troops in Albania, the Bulgarian authorities may think that its security is more guaranteed after joining the Berlin-Rome Axis. This did not make France feel uneasy, because the attitude of the Bulgarian authorities has always been mild and cautious. It has a sincere and trustworthy relationship with Yugoslavia and Greece, and has good relations with Romania, so it may not be moved by the propaganda campaign and suddenly change its attitude. In addition, after Prime Minister Koseivanov visits Germany and Italy, the Speaker of the Bulgarian National Assembly, Mohanov, will travel to London and Paris in a short period of time. It can be seen that Bulgaria will maintain neutrality between the two major groups of democratic countries and autocratic countries, no different from Yugoslavia. (May 4, Havas)</p>

<p>(London) Informed sources here recently stated that after the British cabinet holds a cabinet meeting tomorrow, Prime Minister Chamberlain will issue a statement in the House of Commons, issuing a clear warning to the German government, urging it to pay attention to the consequences of interfering in the issue of the Free City of Danzig. The wording of this statement is being exchanged between the British and French governments. According to reports, the cabinet members originally considered two approaches: (1) making representations to the German government; (2) issuing a public declaration, warning Germany. Most cabinet members immediately decided to adopt the second approach because the first approach had proven to be a failure during the Czech crisis last September. Foreign Secretary Halifax especially advocated this, believing that the situation has now eased slightly and that an opportunity should be seized to express something, rather than waiting for the situation to become tense again before doing so.

<p>Warsaw: Ambassador Raczyński to Britain and Colonel Koc, the chief representative of the Polish financial delegation to London, recently returned to their country. They were both received by President Mościcki. It is generally expected that Britain will lend Poland a huge sum of 40 million pounds, half in cash and half in the form of armaments. In addition, it is reported that the Polish government will submit a note to the Senate of the Free City of Danzig next week, or even on the 15th of this month, protesting against the various military measures taken by the city recently. (May 4, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The Polish ambassador to Britain returned to Warsaw by plane yesterday, carrying a document requesting the German side to immediately stop military activities in Danzig. It is reported that the document has been endorsed by the British government and will be delivered to the Danzig authorities today. The British and French governments have given absolute support to the document. According to the Polish side, the Polish government is carefully considering sending an ultimatum to the Danzig Nazi Party authorities, demanding that the Nazi Party stop military preparations in Danzig, on the grounds that this move violates the treaty (according to the treaty, Danzig has become a League of Nations-administered territory protected by Poland). The document will also demand the dissolution of the newly organized Danzig City Defense Force and the removal of the German artillery positions on the Danzig heights. The document will also threaten to enforce the demands by force. In other words, if the request is refused, the Polish side will send troops into Danzig. At the same time, British Ambassador to Germany Henderson has returned to London from Berlin to meet with Chamberlain. In addition, the British Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee discussed the issue of economic assistance to Poland last night. (May 5, Associated Press)</p>

<p>Warsaw:  The national tension in Poland due to Germany's intimidation and seizure of Danzig has eased somewhat today, as Poland has received repeated assurances of immediate aid from Britain and France, causing the postponement of the Nazi Party's planned coup in Danzig. According to unofficial sources, Polish officials are extremely concerned about the deployment of troops to Danzig to protect the Free City against "Polish intimidation." (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Danzig:  Nazi Party sources announced last night that Danzig is now making military preparations to "protect itself until German troops arrive from East Prussia" in the event of a European war. One thousand Danzig youths have been conscripted into "police" work. The Nazi Party government has issued an order requiring all residents to perform "important work for the state." Although the order has not yet been implemented, well-informed Nazi Party members claim that "if necessary to speed up defense preparations, we will need laws from books." They explained that defense projects include the construction of barracks and trenches along the Polish border. At the same time, the Danzig Bank has ordered the suspension of payments on principal and interest of Danzig's foreign debt until further notice, a move reportedly intended to maintain Danzig's foreign exchange reserves. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Warsaw:  It has been learned that the Danzig Bank has suspended payments on foreign debt starting today (most bondholders are British and American).

<p>Hyde Park, New York: President Roosevelt, speaking to reporters today, on "American Independence Day," advocated that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee carefully study the issue of amending the current Neutrality Act. He said, "The goal of the government's foreign policy, in a nutshell, is to prevent war from breaking out in any part of the world. Therefore, any method that can avoid conflict is a good strategy for us. Secretary of State Hull recently spoke out, strongly advocating the repeal of the arms embargo provision of the Neutrality Act, and I strongly agree. For example, after the House of Representatives passed the Vorys Amendment yesterday, retaining the wartime arms embargo provision, the fascist and Nazi countries all expressed their delight. Judging from this, the House of Representatives' vote is actually unfavorable to the European situation and makes the crisis of war even more imminent, and it makes it even more difficult for our country to avoid getting caught up in the vortex of war." At this point in President Roosevelt's speech, a reporter asked whether the government wanted to use the Bloom bill (advocating the repeal of the wartime arms embargo provision) as the basis for Senate discussion. The President replied, "What we are focusing on now is the goal, not other trivial matters. In terms of the wording of the provisions, it may only be necessary to change a number or two to achieve our goal. I plan to confer with Secretary of State Hull tomorrow, but whether I will meet with leaders of all parties in Congress has not yet been decided. In addition, regarding the issue of extending the validity of my authority over currency and finance, I am currently maintaining contact with the Treasury Department. Today, I invited Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to a picnic together, but we did not formally discuss this. I am scheduled to return to Washington tonight before traveling to the Alaskan Peninsula, but I will stay in Hyde Park for a few days in the future." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Hyde Park: According to sources close to President Roosevelt last night, the President is now even more concerned about the possibility of a European war and believes that the US House of Representatives' refusal to abolish the law banning the export of arms actually strengthens the position of Germany and Italy. Diplomatic reports from Europe received by the President have confirmed that Germany and Italy regard the House's move as a sign of the American people's lack of sympathy for the authorities' criticism of dictators. Well-informed sources claim that President Roosevelt believes that the United States will take a very noteworthy peace action, namely, notifying dictatorial countries that once war breaks out, democratic countries such as Britain and France can purchase arms from the United States.

<p>(London) A bill to amend the current trademark law to ensure that imported goods are clearly marked with their country of origin was introduced in the House of Commons yesterday by Labour MP Edward. After lengthy discussion, it passed its first reading. According to Edward, the fact that goods from Germany, Japan and other countries are only marked with the word "Foreign" makes it impossible for the British to distinguish which country the goods come from when purchasing them. Before the bill was introduced, Labour MP Kirkwood spoke out, saying that it was urgently necessary to have imported goods marked with their country of manufacture, and cited several kinds of woollen clothing and toys imported from Japan as evidence. Secretary of Commerce Stanley replied that he had consulted with all relevant parties on whether to abolish the current practice of allowing imports to be arbitrarily marked with the word "Foreign" or "Empire" to indicate their origin, instead of clearly indicating their country of manufacture. As a result, opinions from all parties differed greatly. However, he and the Minister of Agriculture had decided after consultation that there were sufficient reasons in principle to abolish the arbitrary selection method of allowing the use of "Foreign" or "Empire" to mark the origin of goods, and were currently studying the practical difficulties that merchants here would encounter in changing the method, so as to avoid causing them losses and excessive inconvenience. Labour MP Johnston then stated in a supplementary question that some commercial firms have the same labels for both foreign and imperial products, and allow those who purchase the goods to decide whether to add the words "Foreign" or "Empire." He could provide a can of Japanese salmon as proof, on the label of which there was a blank space for adding the words "Foreign" or "Empire." The Secretary of Commerce would conduct an investigation after evidence was presented. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<p>(London) Secretary of Commerce Stanley stated in the House of Commons today that in the five months from January to May of this year, a total of 2.25 million pounds of Japanese tea were imported, accounting for about 1.5 percent of the total tea imported during the same period. He heard that cheaper Japanese tea was sold for six to seven pence per pound. He also knew that this kind of tea was mixed with imperial tea to be packaged into cheap tea. Stanley also said that he had no right to terminate the import of Japanese tea. Labour MP Swann asked Stanley if he knew that Japanese tea was mixed with Ceylon and Indian tea and sold as imperial tea. Stanley replied that if he received confirmation, he would investigate the matter, but according to his information, this was not the case, and according to the law, this would naturally not be allowed. Stanley replied to a further supplementary question that this kind of tea was not called British tea. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>(Washington Airmail) The British-American Reciprocal Trade Agreement went into effect on January 1 of this year. The initial four months of trade statistics for each country have now been published by the authorities here. It is clear that the export of American goods to Britain has decreased by $32,469,000 compared to the same period last year, while the import of British goods into the United States has increased by $2,004,000 compared to the same period last year, with woollen goods accounting for the largest share. During January to April of last year, a total of 1,876,958 yards of woollen goods were imported, with a value of $1,707,241. During the same period this year, it has increased to 3,803,298 yards, with a value of $2,873,189. American business circles, especially woollen and porcelain merchants, have protested to the State Department in view of this unfavorable situation. Commentators generally say that this abnormal situation is caused by repeated crises in Europe and should not be regarded as a normal situation in line with the British-American trade agreement. However, woollen merchants say that since the industry has suffered in the past, they are deeply concerned that this special situation may become permanent and that measures must be taken to remedy it.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Where Is Spain Going? <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Tianfeng, Original by Salvador De Madrlaga, Originally published on April 16, The Sunday Times, London</p>
<p>The author of this article is a well-known Spanish writer and diplomat, whose speculation on the future of his own country is of course more profound than that of foreigners. However, precisely because he is Spanish, he has to be very careful in his wording when writing articles for foreign newspapers discussing the political movements of his country. However, the analysis in this article is exceptionally clear, and its conclusions are also largely correct. —Translator</p>
<p>The seizure of Albania, the guarantees given to Eastern European countries under the threat of the Axis powers, and the end of the Spanish Civil War have all changed the balance of power in Europe. But to what extent? This depends mostly on Spain's attitude when the next major war breaks out. To avoid errors caused by arbitrariness, emotion, propaganda, and wishes, we should best analyze it with facts.</p>
<p>The first fact is that among the three theoretically possible situations (i.e., joining the British and French side, neutrality, or joining the Axis powers — Translator), only two are worth discussing: neutrality or standing on the side of the totalitarian powers. This is a conclusion derived from the following two observations: One is the attitude of certain powers towards Spain during the civil war; and the other is that even in the ideal situation of the last war, the Allied powers could not pull her to their side. Therefore, in analyzing the current situation, the factors unfavorable to joining the totalitarian powers can be regarded as favorable to maintaining neutrality.</p>
<p>Factors Unfavorable to Neutrality</p>
<p>First, the new regime's gratitude to Italy and Germany. This feeling cannot be underestimated, although contrary opinions have been published in London newspapers. Spanish history tells us that the Spanish are very rich in the spirit of "repayment," and this spirit will permeate her foreign policy.</p>
<p>Second, Spain has never suffered from being ruled by Italy, and she has only been ruled by Germany once. However, Britain's control of Gibraltar is the main driving force behind the division of the Spanish peninsula and the Spanish Empire. As for France, she rarely incites due to her relationship with Spain, as the history of Morocco can attest.</p>
<p>The third factor is the maximum power of the new regime (National Syndicalist Movement), which is friendly to Fascist and Nazi countries.</p>
<p>Fourth, the totalitarian powers' military offensive policy will make them demand political prices as a reward for their help during the civil war.</p>
<p>Fifth, the possible temptation of "booty," which can be obtained from the war against Britain and France. In particular, Gibraltar, no Spanish state, royalist, or anyone else believes that it was illegally annexed by Britain; as for Morocco, France is the enemy there.</p>
<p>Sixth, after the end of the civil war military operations, the well-trained victorious army has a desire to occupy. (This refers to the delayed withdrawal of German and Italian troops, most of which have now been withdrawn. —Translator)</p>
<p>Factors Favorable to Neutrality</p>
<p>On the other hand, the first reason is the strong traditional spirit of neutrality, which arises from the idea of ​​getting rid of illusions and skepticism. And this spirit has been strengthened and developed by the civil war, except for the most warlike and extreme nationalists.</p>
<p>Second, "peaceful coexistence with Britain" is almost an equally strong tradition. If London's steady policy remains unchanged, this tradition will undoubtedly encourage Spanish neutrality.</p>
<p>Third, there is a general sympathy for Western European countries. Although not limited, it cannot be suppressed, but it is a clear obstacle to the more distant German-Italian alliance.</p>
<p>Fourth, is the general Spanish lack of respect for the Italian language and Italians. Because Spanish and Italian are unusually similar, comparing one writing system to another sounds ridiculous. In addition, the Spanish have a tendency to view Italian affairs as theatrical activities. This factor sounds abstract, but like many unconscious forces, it is unusually important and should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Fifth is that Spain feels that the help the National Army received during the civil war was not for Spain, but for other reasons. This feeling is bound to develop, because Italy is negotiating the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers like a kind of asset.</p>
<p>There are other reasons. One of them is that Britain and France are important customers in commerce; Spain's trade with Italy is unfavorable because Italy's production and consumption situation is similar to Spain; there are also obvious obstacles to maintaining satisfactory commerce with countries like Germany, because Germany is still struggling under the state of suffering damage.</p>
<p>In addition, there are geographical factors. It is difficult for Italy to form a connected front with Spain; as for Germany, it is simply impossible. Behind the Spanish nationalist movement, there are also the forces of free conservatives and royalist Catholics. They are of course unhappy with the anti-Catholic atmosphere of totalitarianism.</p>
<p>Another important point is the status of Portugal. Portugal is Spain's first friend and is destined to be an ally of Britain. Spain's non-aggression pact with Portugal is equivalent to Spain under the rule of the National Army promising to maintain neutrality to British-linked Portugal.</p>
<p>Finally, the people have deeply felt the pain of war. Every thoughtful Spaniard is convinced that only neutrality can achieve national unity and rebuild Spain.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The above are all facts. We cannot draw decisive conclusions from this, but a few general observations can be determined.</p>
<p>(1) Time helps neutrality. The sooner a major war breaks out, the more difficult it will be for Spain under the rule of the National Army to separate from its allies and maintain neutrality.</p>
<p>(2) The policies of Western European countries towards Spain also have a great relationship. This lies not only in the fact that there should be constructive and firm countermeasures against the Axis countries' disturbances, but also in giving Spain concrete assistance, so as to offset the help given by the Axis countries to the National Army.</p>
<p>(3) So far, all phenomena are unfavorable to neutrality, including the accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact and the delayed departure of Italian troops from Spain.</p>
<p>(4) If Spain were to move in unison with the Axis powers, she would always be a burden rather than a useful asset, whether in terms of strategy or political strategy.</p>

<p>Qingpu Correspondence: The Japanese troops along the Qingpu-Shanghai and Qingpu-Songjiang routes have been repeatedly attacked. Although they have repeatedly requested assistance from the Japanese headquarters in Shanghai, they have not been granted it. Previously, Shimada, the captain of the Qingpu garrison, in order to strengthen his defense forces, ordered Japanese troops to join forces with puppet troops to forcibly conscript farmers from villages around the city to replenish their military numbers, in order to achieve their goal of using Chinese to control Chinese. In recent days, more than two hundred people have been forcibly taken away. It is also heard that the Japanese troops in Songjiang are also forcibly conscripting laborers, partly to replenish their military numbers and assist the Japanese troops stationed at various strongholds along the Shangsong Road, and the rest are forced to repair the QingSong Highway, which has been destroyed by guerrillas.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Kunshan Qiantun Town Japanese Troops Lured and Twenty Killed <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: Qiantun Town in Kunshan is the hometown of Gu Tinglin, a sage of the region. It is a hub of transportation and a prosperous commercial center. Since its fall, it has been in a state of chaos. Local thugs and ruffians have organized puppet maintenance societies. A unit of Japanese troops is also stationed in the town, but because of its weak military strength, it is frequently transferred. On June 28th, the Japanese troops stationed in the town were ordered to transfer elsewhere. After learning of this, the guerrillas sent a team member disguised as a farmer to the puppet district office, falsely claiming that seven or eight bandits in × village west of the town were robbing farmers of their property and requesting that the Japanese authorities be asked to send troops to suppress them. The puppet district chief, because the Japanese troops in the town had been transferred, reported this to the Japanese headquarters in Jiaozhi Town, which is adjacent to the town. After receiving the report, the headquarters immediately dispatched twenty Japanese troops to Qiantun. Unexpectedly, after arriving in the town, just as they were questioning the puppet district office, fifty or sixty guerrillas suddenly rushed in from outside and wiped out almost all the Japanese troops in the office. At this time, the puppet district chief was greatly alarmed and immediately opened the back door, so the surviving Japanese troops were able to escape and fled back to Jiaozhi in a panic, reporting the details to the Japanese commander. Upon hearing the report, the Japanese commander was furious and immediately sent a large number of Japanese troops, carrying three machine guns, to Qiantun. When they arrived in the town, the guerrillas had already disappeared. The Japanese troops took their anger out on the puppet district chief and wanted to execute him by shooting, but after repeated pleas for mercy, he was spared because of his meritorious service in opening the door and letting the Japanese troops escape.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Jiangsu Provincial Government Punishes Personnel Involved in the Qihai Incident Chen Caifu and Ding Jutang Removed from Posts, Zhang Yi and Sun Xinfu Also Dismissed but Retained <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: In mid-June of this year, conflicts occurred between the units of Chen Caifu and Ding Jutang, stationed in the Haimen-Qidong area, and the units of Zhang Yi, Sun Xinfu, and Zhang Nengren. Yesterday, the provincial authorities issued an order to punish the responsible personnel involved in this incident, in order to serve as a warning. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident</p>
<p>In April of this year, Chen Caifu's unit was praised by the authorities for luring and killing Japanese troops. In addition to requesting the central government to commend him, Chen was also promoted to the rank of brigadier of the newly organized brigade to encourage him. However, Chen became arrogant and complacent, collecting civilian firearms everywhere to expand his strength. In early June, he forcibly incorporated the Nantong County Regular Army. The officers and soldiers of the various teams, unwilling to be oppressed by Chen, voluntarily left Chen's unit and withdrew to the vicinity of Juegang. Wu Chunke, the special commissioner of the Fourth District, telegraphed the above situation to the provincial government and Chief Commander Li. The authorities issued a telegram ordering a halt and ordered the county police brigade to be handed over to Director Wang of the Department of Civil Affairs for handling, and the regular brigade to be under the jurisdiction of the Nantong County Government, supervised and reorganized by Special Commissioner Wu, in order to maintain the local military and administrative system. As a result, Chen became dissatisfied with Wu and actively plotted revenge. At the same time, the Ao Ziming Regiment of the 5th Regular Brigade, stationed in the Haiqi area, was considered to hinder its strength development. Chen then colluded with Ding Jutang's unit to surround the Ao Regiment, claiming to confiscate their firearms. Later, Chief Commander Li rushed to the scene to reason and strictly forbade it, and the situation was temporarily calmed down.</p>
<p>Course of the Conflict</p>
<p>Seeing that the incident had been resolved, Chief Commander Li returned to his headquarters in the province, and the Ao Regiment also safely moved north. However, Chen and Ding's units were still unable to let go of the previous events. On June 11, Chen's unit divided into two routes and attacked Sanyu Town, Beixing Bridge, and Juegang. At the same time, leaflets jointly signed by Ding and Chen were found everywhere, claiming to sweep away the local government and expel officials at all levels. Ding Jutang's unit also forcibly confiscated the firearms of Cao Chiheng's Regular Brigade of Qidong County. Furthermore, because Zhou Ruqian, the secretary-general of the Qidong County Party Headquarters, was dissatisfied with their actions, he was illegally detained by them and has not been found to this day. Therefore, the sub-district commander Zhang Yi and deputy commander Sun Xinfu led the units of Zhang and Ao to jointly counterattack, and the conflict broke out. Although the authorities had previously received confidential reports from various parties about the various tyrannical acts of Chen and Ding's units, and the news that Chen had been appointed as a puppet army commander by Wang Jingwei, they still hoped to promote their awakening through peaceful means with a spirit of leniency and urgently telegraphed Zhang and Sun's units to make concessions and avoid conflict. However, the two sides had already come into contact, and it was too late to stop them, so there was no way to end the conflict. As a result of the conflict, Ding and Chen's units were completely resolved on the 13th and 14th. Ding and Chen left their units and went elsewhere. Now the local police affairs are being handled by Yan Xiuwu, the regimental commander of Ding's unit, and the magistrates of Haiqi counties.</p>
<p>Separate Punishments</p>
<p>The provincial authorities punished the personnel involved in this incident who were responsible for selling out the country. The telegram order is as follows: "After investigation, Chen Caifu, the brigadier of the newly organized brigade, forcibly incorporated the Nantong County Regular Army, refused to listen to the prohibition, caused disputes, and claimed to sweep away governments at all levels and expel local officials, and attacked north with troops. Ding Jutang, the commander of the Fourth Column, instigated from the middle, causing the incident, and forcibly confiscated the firearms of the Qidong County Regular Brigade and detained the secretary-general of the Qidong County Party Headquarters, all of which were arrogant and illegal. Since Zhang Yi, the deputy commander of the Fourth Guerrilla Area and commander of the Third Sub-area, and Sun Xinfu, the deputy commander, led their troops to pursue and resolve the situation, the serial number of Chen Caifu's newly organized brigade is hereby revoked. Ding Jutang is to be dealt with by Chief Commander Li and reported for verification. His position as commander of the Fourth Column is to be replaced by his deputy commander Yan Xiuwu. However, Zhang Yi, Sun Xinfu, etc., failed to uphold the government's intention of leniency and correct the situation through peaceful means, and without orders, they rashly went deep into Qihai and resolved the situation by force, which is also inappropriate. The post of commander of Zhang Yi is hereby revoked, and the commander of the Third Sub-area is dismissed but retained. The post of deputy commander of Sun Xinfu is hereby revoked, and the brigade commander of the 5th Regular Brigade is dismissed but retained, in order to serve as a warning. The firearms confiscated by the various units are to be reported truthfully and await disposal. In addition to separate orders, you are to forward this to be observed. Han Deqin, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Lusu War Zone and Acting Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government."</p>

<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The silkworm and silk industry in Hangzhou has been completely controlled by the "China Silk Company." All silk factories such as Weicheng, Hangzhou, and Hulin are operated by the Japanese and puppet regimes. Tu Pingzhi, the manager of the Puli Silkworm Farm outside Qingtai Gate, has been cooperating with the Japanese for half a year. The Chinese army has been trying to destroy it for a long time but has not had the opportunity. At around 10 o'clock the night before last, a plainclothes team mixed into the crowd and secretly went to the farm to set fire. The fire lasted for three hours. When the fire was at its height, more than 30 soldiers from the Hirose unit of the Japanese army rushed to the farm and arrested more than ten neighbors, forcibly accusing them of hiding guerrillas. However, the entire farm was burned down, with losses amounting to more than ten thousand yuan. The next night, the Yuanfeng Cocoon Firm, organized by the China Silk Company in Daguan, and the Guanyinqiao China Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Plant were also attacked by more than twenty plainclothes heroes, carrying wooden-cased guns and Mauser pistols. They rushed in. The puppet police guarding the factory resisted, and the plainclothes heroes killed several puppet policemen on the spot. A puppet patrol leader was captured alive and taken away. The storage warehouse was completely burned down by the plainclothes heroes, with significant losses. After the incident, the Japanese military police, together with the puppet police, launched a search and arrested three villagers, including Pan Xinghu, in Sandun Town, and took them to the puppet police station for strict interrogation.</p>

<p>Dinghai Correspondence: Dinghai County is the largest island in the Zhoushan Islands, located in the east of Zhejiang Province. It is separated from Chuanshan in Zhenhai by only a narrow stretch of water to the west, bordering Xiangshan to the southeast. Its eastern Qingbang and Miaozihu islands border Japan. It is an isolated overseas territory and a major producing area of China's fishing and salt industries, administering the four towns of Shenjiamen, Zaicheng, Daitou, and Dazhan, as well as the eighteen townships of Gaoxie, Baiquan, Yancang, and Gan*. The area is vast, with a total population of 420,000. The people are honest and simple, but the island fishermen are relatively tough. Since the new County Magistrate Su Benshan took office, he has led the political work team members to improve politics, recruit sea bandits, and strengthen self-defense forces. In the shortest period of time, Dinghai has shown progress. This time, the sudden landing of Japanese troops in Dinghai, the police team was caught off guard, and the Japanese firepower was fierce, so the outnumbered were no match for the enemy. In a few hours, the county seat was lost, which is extremely painful. The details of the process are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Landing Situation</p>
<p>Dinghai is an important producing area of fisheries and salt, and the Japanese have long coveted it. However, in the past, because Dinghai had no major military value, and it was known that the Chinese side had considerable troops stationed there, it did not dare to occupy it. Recently, because the Japanese urgently wanted to attack Ningbo and Zhenhai, they occupied Dinghai as a base. On the one hand, after Daishan was occupied by the Japanese army, the Chinese dare-to-die teams often crossed the sea to attack. The traitors in Daishan, etc., then flattered the Japanese, strongly stating the importance of Dinghai. In order to consolidate Daishan, it was necessary to occupy Dinghai County first. Therefore, the Japanese army seized Dinghai at around 3:00 a.m. on June 23. On the one hand, they landed at Luotou, Yancang, about ten li from the western corner of the city, and on the other hand, they landed near Tianluozhi, passing through Xiao Xi Gen from the west and entering the city from the east gate. At the same time, two Japanese warships were anchored in the Mazhi waters opposite Shenjiamen, and they also landed at Duntou, about five or six li west of Shenzhen, on the morning of the 23rd. On the one hand, small Japanese warships were used to bombard Gan* Township, about thirty li from the city, in the Xiushan waters north of the county seat, in order to disrupt the rear. On the one hand, two Japanese warships were anchored at Wu Kui Mountain in Chongtou, using artillery to bombard the city to cover the landing of Japanese soldiers. In total, the Japanese army landed at three locations and harassed at two locations. The number of troops on the three routes was about 1,000. Because they had traitors to guide them, they were familiar with the route. Moreover, when they landed, the traitors in the city set off firecrackers in the urban area as a signal. On the one hand, they used the "Great Japan" flag to hang over the four cities to confuse the military's morale. Therefore, the fall of Dinghai was actually due to the traitors.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Situation</p>
<p>When the Japanese army landed in Yancang, because they were all wearing grass-green uniforms and steel helmets, they looked exactly like the Chinese self-defense forces, so the residents were ignorant. Later, when they saw them sweeping with machine guns, they realized that they were Japanese soldiers. The First Battalion of the Sixth District National Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force stationed at Xiaofeng Ridge heard the news and was led by Battalion Commander Jiang Shilin, Yang Kaizu, and Company Commander Song Shengji to fight bravely. After an hour of fierce fighting, they were forced to retreat safely due to the fierce Japanese artillery fire. The Japanese army then rushed into the west city. County Magistrate Su received the report and personally led his troops to street fighting in the city. The fierce fighting was the most intense in front of the North Gate Police Station. Later, the Chinese army retreated to the northern suburbs, where Zhang Fucheng, the battalion commander of the Dinghai County Self-Defense Force, led the Hunanese heroes to fight bravely. Battalion Commander Zhang had previously served as a major general and guerrilla commander in the Red Army and had rich combat experience. Therefore, he took the lead and fought bravely under heavy fire for several hours, killing many Japanese soldiers. As for the Shenjiamen area, after the Japanese soldiers landed at Duntou, they passed through Xichengtang and Baihu Mountain. The Shenzhen Self-Defense Force stationed there immediately launched a battle. Although the team was composed of gentry and elite, and all were obligated, their morale was no less than that of regular troops. Therefore, both sides suffered heavy casualties in this battle. At that time, the Chinese naval police force was also led by Captain Wang Pinyuan to resist, and they fought each other for several hours. Because they were outnumbered, they retreated to Dazhan Luomen, crossed the sea to Shipu, waited for reinforcements, and counterattacked. On the evening of the 23rd, County Magistrate Su, along with Ding Songsheng, the chief staff officer of the county headquarters, and Battalion Commander Zhang, planned a counterattack in Fanhe. On the one hand, they also mobilized the Xiushan Township Self-Defense Force. At that time, Li Xuefan, a prominent figure in the township, gathered the brave young men of the township and sent them to Sanjiang to defend against the enemy. At 12 o'clock in the evening, Battalion Commander Zhang led his troops across Fanhe Ridge again to counterattack the northern city. The Chinese side used hand grenades to bombard the Japanese positions. Seeing the Chinese army's night attack, the Japanese soldiers responded in a panic, using machine guns to sweep aimlessly. Later, because the city gate was solid and the firepower was fierce, the Chinese army returned to its original position safely. Seeing that the Chinese army often launched surprise attacks, the Japanese army was extremely panicked. Therefore, they built fortifications near the four cities and installed artillery positions to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking.</p>
<p>Martyrdom</p>
<p>When the Japanese army forcibly landed in Dinghai, the Chinese soldiers and civilians gave them a head-on blow. Many people heroically sacrificed themselves. According to reports, about seven or eight members of the 6th District Anti-Japanese Guard Team were killed or injured, and thirty or forty members of the County Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Force were killed or injured. Battalion Adjutant Zhou Xinbao also died at the same time. Four or five trainees from the cadre training class died. Ye Menglin, the deputy captain of Weitou Town, was the eldest son of Ye Baochang, the head of Dasha Township. He was brave and good at fighting. This time, he unfortunately died in battle in the eastern suburbs. There was also Gao Liangcai, a member of the political work team, who was ordered by the county magistrate to inquire about the Japanese situation. When his bicycle reached the northern suburbs, he learned that the Japanese army had occupied the northern city. Therefore, the Japanese army shot Gao with machine guns, and he was wounded in his left arm by bullets, almost fainting. Later, he was carried to a rural hospital by the rescue team. It was also heard that many students of Zhoushan Middle School and members of the propaganda work team suffered because they did not have time to escape. On the civilian side, although they had been evacuated to the suburbs before the incident, only a few were able to do so, so about sixty or seventy people were killed or injured. It was heard that Xu Wencai, the owner of the Wu Kang rice shop on Beida Street, was shot and killed by the Japanese army when he returned to the store to get rice. Also, when the Chinese army retreated to Jintang Island to cross the sea to Yong, they encountered a Japanese warship and were bombarded and densely swept with heavy machine guns. As a result, about seventy members of the Independent Company of the Third District Self-Defense Force were sunk along with the ship. Luo, the captain of the Xiushan Township Self-Defense Force, and the team members Tong Xincai, Chen Quanzhang, and A Dong and others died heroically. Li Xuefan, a prominent figure in the township, generously donated money to comfort their families in order to appease the loyal souls, seeing that the team members were loyal and commendable. County Magistrate Su presented a request to Chairman Huang to provide condolences and issue commendations to the officers and soldiers who died in this battle.</p>
<p>Crossing the Sea to Seek Assistance</p>
<p>When the Japanese army attacked the city at dawn on the 23rd, County Magistrate Su led his troops to resist. Later, because he was isolated and without assistance, he retreated to the Changchun Ridge area of Xuhe at around 9:00 a.m. The city of Dinghai was completely lost at around 10:00 a.m. that day. The next morning, County Magistrate Su, seeing that he was outnumbered and without assistance, led his subordinates across Cengang, crossed the sea to Cezi Island, and then secretly crossed to Chuanshan, went to Yongzhuan Jin, and personally reported the incident to Chairman Huang and requested assistance to counterattack. Therefore, the Dinghai army has now safely withdrawn, leaving only a small number of self-defense corps in the countryside to maintain law and order. The most shameful thing is that Deputy Commander Luo Chidi, when the Japanese army bombarded the city, ignored the local area and first went to Zhoushan Middle School to accompany Fan Yawei, a female teacher of the school and a graduate of Beijing Women's Normal University, and fled to Xiaosha, and extorted more than 600 yuan locally before escaping across the sea. There was also Li Chongxian, the commander of the Independent Company of the Third District Self-Defense Force, who led his troops to Cezi Island and solicited thousands of yuan from the locals, ostensibly to replenish military pay, but in reality, to fill his own pockets. These officials who are greedy for life, afraid of death, extort, and extort, and cannot coexist with the city, should be severely punished.</p>
<p>Japanese Search</p>
<p>When the Japanese army occupied Dinghai, they distributed leaflets by plane, with extremely absurd wording. The leaflets were printed in color lead and were issued in two issues. As for the actions of the Japanese soldiers, they first set fire to the Dongyue Temple and the Puji Temple in the northern suburbs, and searched people's homes. When inspecting, they would tease women and forcibly occupy Wang Chuansun's residence under the Dayu Bridge in the East Gate as the Japanese headquarters, and Zhao's foreign house in the eastern suburbs as the naval headquarters. They also stationed troops in Pan Shanglin's house at Guanyin Bridge in the South Gate, forcibly occupied Zhoushan Primary and Secondary Schools, which were run by the American Baptist Church, stationed the commander-in-chief in Zhoushan Primary School in the North Gate, and stationed Japanese soldiers in Zhoushan Middle School in the West Gate. Every night, they would drag women to the commander's office and release them the next morning, sending some sashimi as a souvenir. They also recruited strong men to build fortifications. After the work, they would send rings or bracelets as a temptation. However, after the strong men were released, they would be taken away by the Japanese soldiers when they passed by other places. Hundreds of young people were captured and imprisoned in the Gan Dasheng Temple in the North Gate, without food or drink, and left to starve. More than 100 young women were imprisoned in the Dongguan Temple in the East Gate, with two meals a day, and arbitrarily ravaged. Recently, they have also put forward conditions to the puppet maintenance society, saying that (1) 40 strong men should be drawn from each guarantee to be used, and (2) about 600 Japanese soldiers should be stationed in Dinghai, and it should be guaranteed that not one should be missing. Therefore, the ugly groups are already very embarrassed. As for the Shenjiamen area, the atrocities of the Japanese are even more terrifying. They set fire to the County Chamber of Commerce, the Town Office, and the former residence of Mr. Liu Jiting, and burned down the Gongdun, Tianhou Palace, Dongyue Palace, People's Education Center, and Shen Police Station. For a time, the fire soared into the sky, the whole city was red, and the flames were flying, and it was extinguished after burning for more than a day. On the 24th, the Japanese army, guided by traitors, searched the villages. Dinghai has many high mountains and steep ridges, and guerrilla warfare can be launched, but because the army has completely withdrawn, even remote areas have the traces of the Japanese, and the traitors who work for the tigers are even bolder. They first went to Fanhe to search, and then went to Gaoxie to search. When they arrived at Baihe Temple, because it stored food such as agar and was also the township office, it was set on fire. Gaoxie is very close to Baiquan, but the Japanese soldiers searched to Shujia before returning to the city. Therefore, Rizquan, Gan*, Ma'ao, Beichan, Ziewei, and other townships have not yet been searched. On the 27th, they went over Changchun Ridge, Lancaoling, Xiaoshuling, Dashuling, and Xiaosha to search, checking house by house, and stationed troops in the Great Temple. They also ordered the township to hand over Yue Shuyou, the director of the Third District, Le Zhiyun, the head of the township, and the gentry Chen Ziping for use as puppets. However, the three had already escaped without a trace, so the Japanese were very disappointed. The next day, they went to Cengang to search, and then went to remote areas such as Zikuo, Wuqiu, Zhangci, and Dingzi to search. After the inspection, they took a boat to Daitou and returned to the city. The Japanese troops in Shenjiamen heard that they had recently searched Dazhan and other townships.</p>
<p>Puppet Lineup</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army landed in Dinghai, the shameless ruffians in the city have taken advantage of the fire to rob and flattered the Japanese, acting as accomplices. Now the puppet治安维持会 has been organized, and the chairman is Ding Ziheng, the first county magistrate of Dinghai. The other important figures in the society are said to be Fang Dongyuan, the principal of Zhoushan Middle School, Chen Dehong, the pastor of Zhen God Church, the gentry Chen Er, the leader of the fundraising team Shen Kunquan, the director of the Food Company Hong Qiliang, and Dai Yuanzhang of Guoxi. However, it is said that Ding Ziheng was forced to take office because he was old and unable to escape. Chen Ermei and Shen Kunquan are wealthy gentry in the county, and they were forced to take office to protect their family property. As for Fang Tongyuan, he reluctantly served the enemy to preserve the property of Zhoushan Middle School. Pastor Chen stayed in Dinghai because he wanted to help the refugees and was forced to take office. The puppet chairmen are usually enthusiastic and upright people, and although they were forced to take puppet positions this time, they want to put the local area first and will not prey on the people. Now that security has been restored, residents can enter the city, but they must have a pass. It is heard that He Chuicang is the one who issues passes for the maintenance association in the North City, and a certain national doctor in the South City. Therefore, residents are now returning to the city one after another, living a tragic life under the iron hooves of the Japanese.</p>
<p>Xiushan is in Danger</p>
<p>Lanxiu Township, which belongs to the county, is a large island in the county and is located in the middle of Dinghai and Daishan. The current situation is critical. Most of the people in the township are doing business in Shanghai, transporting fish products and yellow sand to Shanghai for sale. Ships often travel between Xiushan and Shanghai. Recently, because Daishan and Dinghai have fallen one after another, the situation has suddenly turned critical. Moreover, the self-defense force of the township has been transferred to Dinghai to fight, and the defense is empty. Therefore, the township leader Tong Xinli often meets with Li Xuefan, Lin Liangkun, and political work team members Chen Nanchi, Jin Banghua, and Gui Weiyi and others to collect more than 100 civilian firearms, gather the young men of the township, and organize guerrillas to resist Japan and defend themselves. Every night, they set up sentry posts at Lishan Seaport and other places, and when they encountered a boat, they fired a gun and ordered them to lower the sails for strict inspection. Therefore, Xiushan now has a very strong self-defense force. Recently, it is said that the Daishan puppet maintenance society sent a letter to the Xiushan Township Office, inviting Township Head Tong to go to Daishan. The intention seems to be to occupy Xiushan by political means. If he does not go, the Japanese army will use force to attack Xiushan. When Tong received the news, he convened a joint guarantee meeting at the Suxuan Temple in Beipu to discuss how to deal with the situation. At that time, the people were very afraid of Japan and advised Tong to go to Daishan to negotiate, and bought white cloth from the cloth shop to make the sun flag, which was hung in front of the door. They also raised funds to make a large Japanese flag, which was hung in front of the coast as the main flag, in order to ensure peace. They also said, "The Japanese will come to play a show tomorrow, and we will all go to the pier to welcome them." These foolish people made such heartbreaking and crazy remarks, which is extremely regrettable. Tong and the young men of Haiao, Wu Tongcai, Li Jiafan, etc., immediately stopped them. Tong said enthusiastically at the meeting, "I will never go to Daishan and do something for the tiger. If the Japanese army invades, I will only lead the guerrillas and fight to the death. As for the houses and property in my family, I will not hesitate to have them burned by artillery fire. At this time, when the enemy is threatening us, as a person in charge of the local area, I only know how to be loyal and die in office, and to coexist and die with the hometown, and I can no longer care about my family." The feelings were tragic and moved the hearts of the people, who praised him endlessly. Now that Dinghai has fallen, the important producing area of fish and salt has been trampled on by others, and the 420,000 people are also in a dark hell. Although Dinghai, at the time of the Treaty of Nanjing, the United Kingdom said that Dinghai should not be invaded by any country, otherwise, it should be protected by the United Kingdom, but Dinghai has now fallen, and the United Kingdom is silent. Therefore, the local people should wake up quickly, do not rely on others, and should be self-reliant.</p>

<p>Changzhou Dispatch: For the past ten days, the Chinese army has counterattacked Yixing, creating a siege. The Japanese army requested reinforcements from Suzhou and Changzhou. However, the Japanese forces stationed in Suzhou and Changzhou were insufficient to spare any. They resorted to conscripting men from various counties and mixing them with puppet police. At the end of last month, they headed to Yicheng to fight against the Chinese army. The Chinese army, with its tens of thousands of troops and leveraging excellent terrain, still managed to repel the Japanese. Among the Japanese forces, the captain of the Changzhou Garrison, Honjo, was hit in a vital area and severely wounded. He has been sent to the Japanese military hospital in Suzhou for treatment. The Japanese army suffered widespread casualties and retreated towards Heqiao.</p>

<h3 id="e46">The Two Concession Authorities Adopt Strict Precautions Again: Obstacles Prepared on Several Roads, Troops from Various Countries and Trade Corps to Patrol <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, the entrances of several police stations in the International Settlement have been closed since 6:00 PM yesterday (the 4th) until 6:00 AM this morning. This is part of the second anniversary precautions for the Sino-Japanese War currently being taken. The general arrangements for July 7th are the same as the precautions taken in recent months in anticipation of disturbances. Obstacles will be placed on several roads. Search teams will conduct inspections in certain locations. US Marines, British troops, the International Settlement Volunteer Corps White Russian detachment, and French troops will patrol the streets. The armored vehicle unit of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps will also be dispatched for patrol. The remaining units of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps will be fully armed and gather at assembly points, ready to move out upon notice. Special police will assist regular police as usual. Japanese Marines north of the Suzhou Creek have already implemented precautions and are conducting extensive searches of pedestrians.</p>
<p>Joint Precautions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council, in commemoration of the "July 7th" Marco Polo Bridge Incident in North China, have ordered all police stations to step up precautions in advance to prevent trouble. The necessary precautionary measures to be implemented have been jointly agreed upon by the two authorities. In addition to the full mobilization of police and security personnel in their respective jurisdictions, all British, American, French, and Italian troops stationed in Shanghai, as well as members of the Chinese detachment and White Russian detachment of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, etc., will be armed tonight to undertake security duties.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Assemblies</p>
<p>During the "July 7th" anniversary period, the authorities will strictly prevent all gatherings, parades, and speeches. They will also prohibit ordinary commercial banquets or meetings. Anyone found to be holding private gatherings will be severely punished. At the same time, the standing committees of the two concessions began yesterday morning to search roads, alleys, residences, shops, hotels, and public places in large buildings such as amusement parks, teahouses, and dance halls. Plainclothes detectives have been stationed there on a permanent basis to monitor movements and report any suspicious activity. All Chinese and Western detectives are dispatched early to inspect pedestrians on the roads. Armored vehicles on the French Concession side have been patrolling the roads since yesterday.</p>
<p>Blocking Roads</p>
<p>The procedures for blocking secondary roads at the junctions of the two concessions have been prepared and will be decided based on intelligence received tonight. However, the precautions in the Shanghai West extra-settlement roads area are even more thorough. During this "July 7th" memorial, residents are not allowed to cool off or sleep in the open along the roads, otherwise, they will be detained. The curfew time remains 12:30 AM and will not be moved forward.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Precautions</p>
<p>Tomorrow, "July 7th," marks the second anniversary of the Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident. The authorities of the two concessions in this city are afraid of unfortunate events, so they have prohibited all gatherings for four or five days. Because the anniversaries of "July 7th," "August 13th," and "September 18th" are approaching, the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai fear that patriotic individuals will take action during this period. In addition to intensifying the search of all water and land traffic and imposing blockades, since the day before yesterday, they have added obstacles such as barbed wire to various bridges in the Hongkou district, such as Sika Bridge, Yokohama Bridge, Xin Bridge, Jiaxing Road Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, Lihong Bridge, Outer Hong Bridge, Oujia Road, etc., and increased guard posts. Armed Japanese soldiers and plainclothes puppet detectives are patrolling and searching various roads separately. They are being particularly strict in inspecting "passes." At the same time, puppet police squads are patrolling the Caojiadu area. Pudong and Nanshi have also stepped up precautions. The extent of their fear can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Russian Workers at Lun Chang Factory Poisoned: Food Poisoning Suspected, Expected to Recover Soon <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>According to the *North China Daily News*, yesterday (the 4th), an official from the British Consulate told reporters that of the thirty Russians employed by Lun Chang Printing and Weaving Company some time ago to replace striking Chinese workers at the Lun Chang factory in Pudong, twenty had been poisoned. However, after Dr. 克萊克 examined all the poisoned workers, he discovered that they had suffered from food poisoning, and there was no suspicion of poisoning by evildoers. It is reported that twelve of the poisoned workers are in serious condition.</p>
<p>Serious Condition</p>
<p>However, according to information learned last night, none of them are in critical condition, and they are expected to recover soon. It is believed that they all ate together in the factory, or ate some poisonous food on Sunday. These Russians were hired after a serious strike by Chinese workers in the factory's power room and the injury of a British employee of the factory.</p>
<p>Result of the Strike</p>
<p>A team of British sailors landed, and was then relieved by British soldiers from the West Fokine Heights team. Subsequently, Japanese Marine soldiers from Pudong took over the defense. Today, the property is still defended by Japanese Marines.</p>

<p>Since traffic on the Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Dinghai, and Shanghai-Wenzhou routes was successively disrupted, all foreign ships operating between Shanghai and Zhejiang have been completely suspended. All ships are docked in the Huangpu River, suffering considerable losses. According to reliable information obtained by a *Daguang News Agency* reporter from the shipping industry, foreign shipping companies such as Zhongyi, Taikoo, and Lihe are now meeting to discuss resuming the Shanghai-Ningbo route in order to maintain Shanghai-Ningbo traffic and shipping business. They will dispatch ships such as Deping, Moufu, and New Beijing to operate the route. When each ship arrives in Ningbo, it will anchor outside the Zhenhai estuary, and passengers and cargo will be transferred by barges. It is reported that they have telegraphed the Ningbo authorities requesting approval. If approval is granted, the ships will begin operating on a sequential schedule.</p>

<h3 id="e50">To Alleviate the Copper Coin Shortage Panic: Fractional Currency Notes to Be Issued, Ministry of Finance Requests Central Bank to Investigate and Consider the Needs of the Shanghai Market, Approve the Printing of One- and Five-Fen Fractional Currency Notes <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Since copper coins disappeared from the city, although stamps have been temporarily used as substitutes, they are very inconvenient to accept. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believed that this was affecting the operations of various industries and the livelihoods of ordinary people. It previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting prompt relief. According to a *Xinsheng News Agency* reporter, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed again urging the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance has sent a telegram stating that it will print fractional currency notes. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Telegram</p>
<p>Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance, Chongqing: The disappearance of copper coins in the Shanghai market has made it difficult to make change. The temporary use of stamps as substitutes is only an expedient measure and is very inconvenient. We telegraphed on June [day omitted] requesting relief, but have not yet received a reply. The Shanghai market is anxiously awaiting. Please promptly find a solution, or immediately issue one-fen and five-fen fractional currency notes to facilitate circulation. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows in support.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Telegram</p>
<p>Your telegram received. The Ministry has telegraphed the Central Bank to investigate and consider the needs of the Shanghai market for the serious shortage of copper coins in Shanghai, approve the amount of one-fen and five-fen fractional currency notes to be printed, and ordered their issuance. It is also finding ways to transport one-jiao and two-jiao fractional currency notes for relief. Informing you accordingly. Ministry of Finance, remittance from Chongqing, imprint.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Foreign Exchange Only Provided for Essential Goods: Luxury Goods Banned from Import, Shift to Purchasing Essential Materials for the War of Resistance, Trade with Europe and America Not Affected, Strict Restrictions on Foreign Exchange in Shanghai's Black Market <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance promulgated the regulations on banning the import of luxury and non-essential goods, promoting the export of domestic goods, collecting the foreign exchange rate difference, and applying for foreign exchange for essential goods, the import of non-essential goods will inevitably decrease sharply, reducing the overall trade deficit and balancing international payments. However, this will not affect the overall trade of European and American countries with China. The supply of foreign exchange for essential goods will be provided without restriction by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The supply of foreign exchange in the black market will be strictly restricted to prevent it from becoming more rampant. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Bank of China and Bank of Communications Handling Applications for Sale</p>
<p>After the new regulations on applying for foreign exchange were announced, a *Xinsheng News Agency* reporter yesterday inquired separately at the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. (1) The Central Bank continues to announce the legal price daily as before, but the handling of foreign exchange applications has been ordered to cease. From now on, the handling of foreign exchange applications for essential goods and the sale of foreign exchange for the export of domestic goods will be handled by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. (2) The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have not yet received orders from the Ministry of Finance and the head office and will comply after receiving orders. They are unwilling to express any opinions before receiving orders. (3) According to sources at foreign banks, Shanghai is a special place, and the implementation of the import ban may have problems. It is reported that the Equalization Committee will strictly restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the black market.</p>
<p>Preventing Huge Amounts of Foreign Exchange from Leaking</p>
<p>Regarding luxury goods: (1) Cosmetics: A. Snow powder and snow cream, B. Tooth powder and toothpaste, C. Perfume and rouge, D. Various cosmetics and appliances; (2) Clothing: A. Lace, B. Real and imitation jewelry, C. Valuable wool products, D. Silk products; (3) Food and Beverages: A. Cigarettes and cigars, B. Tobacco leaves, C. Various alcoholic beverages, D. Soda, E. Various candies, F. Biscuits, G. Fresh and dried fruits, H. Sea cucumbers, I. Shark fins, J. Bird's nests. In addition, non-essential goods such as paper, bamboo, wood, wool goods, cotton goods, rattan ware, and stone products are estimated to be worth over 230 million national currency based on the import amount in 1938.</p>
<p>Difficult to Import Non-Essential Goods</p>
<p>The customs offices in the occupied areas are beyond the reach of the government's authority, resulting in an increase in the trade deficit and making it difficult to eliminate. Taking the Shanghai Jianghai Customs as an example, the trade deficit was 9,356,000 yuan in January this year, 5,529,000 yuan in February, 33,092,000 yuan in March, 24,737,000 yuan in April, and 38,671,000 yuan in May, setting a new record for the trade deficit after the war. The imported goods are mostly luxury and non-essential goods. From now on, the import of these luxury and non-essential goods will inevitably decrease.</p>
<p>Providing Foreign Exchange, Restricting the Black Market</p>
<p>A *Xinsheng News Agency* reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that although the Ministry of Finance's measures to prohibit the import of goods have been ordered to be implemented by the Customs, the implementation in the Shanghai Customs and other customs offices in the occupied areas is, in fact, difficult. These customs offices have been seized by the Japanese. If the tax revenue is intercepted and forced to change flags, although the government has issued a ban, it is still impossible to prevent them from being imported through the occupied customs offices. However, after the promulgation of the regulations on applying for foreign exchange, these prohibited goods will inevitably not be able to obtain foreign exchange. Therefore, it is expected that after the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications implement the listing of prices and supply foreign exchange for essential goods, HSBC may restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the black market.</p>
<p>Not Affecting Trade with Various Countries</p>
<p>The Chinese government will transfer the foreign exchange used to import non-essential and luxury goods to purchase essential materials for the war of resistance and national reconstruction. Therefore, China is only changing the use of foreign exchange, and the various countries are only converting the goods they import. Therefore, the trade of various countries with China will not be affected in any way. It is reported that European and American countries have expressed full understanding of China's necessary measures. However, the import of Japanese goods into China will certainly suffer a great impact. Its position as number one will inevitably decline because it will be impossible for Japanese goods to buy foreign exchange in the black market in the future.</p>
<p>Paying for Imports, Receiving for Exports</p>
<p>The Central Bank's decision on foreign exchange rates has always been handled in accordance with the original policy, namely, one shilling and two and a half pence for British exchange and thirty US dollars for American exchange. However, the listed price of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is seven pence for British exchange and 13.625 yuan for American exchange. It is also stipulated that a foreign exchange difference must be paid for applying for foreign exchange for the import of essential goods, and a foreign exchange difference can be received for the sale of foreign exchange for the export of domestic goods in order to ensure uniformity and fairness. The so-called foreign exchange difference refers to the difference between the listed price of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications and the legal price announced by the Central Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Detailed Measures Planned, Remittance Certificates to Be Issued, Evaluation Committee Members Hired Separately, Remittance Deposits Transferred by Three Banks <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new remittance system by the silver and money industry to regulate the Shanghai market, the remittances obtained by each bank and firm from the Bank Clearing House have been circulating in the market. The Clearing House announces the discount rate for remittances daily and hires experts to serve as evaluation committee members and establishes a preparation inspection committee. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Clearing House to Issue Remittance Certificates</p>
<p>After each bank and firm provides property as security and obtains interbank remittances from the Bank Clearing Committee, the Committee will issue remittance checkbooks, which each bank and firm will fill out and circulate in the market. However, it is stipulated that it shall not exceed 70% of the appraised value of the collateral. The total amount has been tentatively set at 50 million yuan. At the same time, in order to facilitate the acceptance and delivery of interbank remittances, the Committee will issue remittance certificates. Detailed measures have been planned and will be implemented after being submitted to the committee for approval. In addition, the types, amounts, and issuance regulations of the remittance certificates will be formulated.</p>
<p>Hiring Evaluators, Forming Inspection Committee</p>
<p>In order to assess the value of the collateral provided by each bank and firm, the Committee has decided to establish a real estate group, a securities and stock group, and a goods group evaluation committee. It has decided to hire experts to serve as members. It is reported that the real estate group will hire managers from China Business Corporation and Yeguang Real Estate Company, etc. The securities and stock group will hire tai-pans from Jardine Matheson and other foreign firms. The goods group will hire leaders from various industries. Regarding the Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Bankers' Association, the Silver and Money Industry Association, and the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank have been requested to nominate one representative each to form the committee. It will be established as soon as the candidates are determined.</p>
<p>Announcing Interbank Remittance Discount Rate</p>
<p>A *Xinsheng News Agency* reporter learned from the Bank Clearing Committee yesterday that the Committee will announce the interbank remittance discount rate daily in accordance with Article 14 of the Interbank Remittance Acceptance Regulations. Yesterday, it was 2.5 jiao per thousand yuan per day. In addition, regarding the remittance deposits of each bank and firm in the Bank Clearing House and the Money Industry Clearinghouse, after the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications transferred the legal tender in twelve weeks, totaling approximately 22 million yuan, the first week's 1.8 million yuan has been settled by the three banks and handed over to the Clearinghouse of the Silver and Money Industries for inclusion in the current accounts of each bank and firm, which are allowed to be withdrawn by each bank and firm at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Turnover Tax in June Less Than One Million: Reason Being Declining Shipping, Favorable to Blocking Loopholes <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>According to customs sources, the turnover tax collected by Jianghai Customs sharply decreased in June, only two-thirds of that in March and April, and was less than one million yuan. The reasons are: (1) The Shanghai-Fujian coast was repeatedly harassed by Japanese warships and aircraft, and shipping declined. (2) The Shanghai-Dinghai-Ningbo-Wenzhou-Fuzhou money order routes were suspended due to military relations, and passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Fujian was in a state of stagnation. (3) The Japanese army landed in Shantou, and Shanghai-Shantou shipping was disrupted. (4) The Tianjin concession was blockaded, and passenger and cargo transportation between Shanghai and Tianjin encountered difficulties. (5) Ports such as Beisha, Haimen, and Qidong were repeatedly harassed by Japanese motorboats, and some port routes were suspended, resulting in a sharp decline in passenger and cargo transportation. (6) The situation in the inner ports was unstable, the number of routes decreased, and passenger and cargo traffic was weak. (7) Inland river shipping did not improve.</p>

<p>The traffic between Shanghai and Shantou is maintained by the best efforts of British firms Jardine Matheson and Taikoo, and the ships on the Hong Kong-bound line serve Bay and Shantou regularly to facilitate the passenger and cargo traffic. They have merely been obstructed from time to time by the Japanese warships, so the British naval authorities have sent warships to provide protection, but ships are still obstructed from entry. All passengers and cargo bound for Shantou are transshipped from the ships by lighters at the port, a process involving a good deal of trouble. The British have made a strong protest to the Japanese again, asking the British ships to be allowed to sail directly into the harbor and berth at the docks, and not to be obstructed without reason. The Yusheng ship has sailed yesterday. The Qiongzhou and Hesheng ships are leaving on the 8th, and the Suzhou and Taiyuan ships, etc. are scheduled to sail to Shanghai on the 11th, and all will still serve Bay and Shantou.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Ministry of Finance Consistently Maintains Creditworthiness: Securities in the Black Market Rebound, Uniformity Already in Place, Payment at the End of July, Recovery Fund and Long-Term Financial Bonds Have Been Regularly Drawn for Principal Repayment <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Since the Chongqing telegram stated that the uniform government bonds guaranteed by tariffs had suspended payment of principal and interest, the uniform bonds in the Shanghai securities black market plummeted. Now, because the Ministry of Finance's policy of maintaining creditworthiness remains unchanged, and arrangements have been made for the repayment of principal and interest of the uniform government bonds due at the end of July, and because the Recovery Public Bonds and Long-Term Financial Bonds, which are also guaranteed by tariffs, have been regularly drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee, the uniform bonds in the securities black market have rebounded uniformly since the market opened the day before yesterday. Yesterday's closing prices were 58 yuan for Class A, 49.4 yuan for Class B, 48.05 yuan for Class C, 47.05 yuan for Class D, and 47.6 yuan for Class E, with gains ranging from 1.25 yuan to 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Shanghai-Siam Navigation: Taikoo Shantou-Siam Ships Rerouted to Shanghai-Siam Route, From Shanghai to Hong Kong, Through Saigon, to Bangkok <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>After the fall of Shantou, the Shanghai-Shantou, Hong Kong-Shantou, and Shantou-to-Southeast Asia routes were completely suspended. Although the Nan Hua class ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo still served Bay and Shantou as usual, they were still unable to enter, and there were no passengers or cargo, making the trips futile, only to look on from outside the harbor. As for the Japanese army's recent occupation of Shantou, according to merchants familiar with the industry,</p>
<p>it greatly hinders shipping. The reason is that since the fall of Guangzhou, Shantou has also become an important port for connecting the interior, and freight transportation is no less than before the war. The goods transported from Shanghai are mostly grains, cotton cloth, etc., of which cotton yarn accounts for 60-70%. Since Shantou was occupied, shipping has been suspended.</p>
<p>The outflow of goods has disappeared. Although Japanese ships can be used for transportation, the outflow of goods relies entirely on distribution in the interior. Now that Shantou is completely cut off from the interior, the goods transported there cannot be distributed, so no matter how much Japanese ships transport, it is useless. The British firm Taikoo formerly had a route from Shantou to Siam, but after the Japanese invasion of Shantou, it also</p>
<p>announced the suspension of navigation. It is now reported that the company has decided to reroute the Shantou-Siam ships to the Shanghai-Siam route, from Shanghai to Hong Kong, through Saigon, to Bangkok in Siam. The Suzhou ship has been dispatched and will depart from Shanghai on the morning of Tuesday (the 11th) for a trial voyage. The ship is currently coming to Shanghai from Hong Kong and is expected to arrive in port around the 8th. In the future, there will be one more route in the city, which will provide great convenience for passengers.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Fundraising Committee for Sanitation Expenses held its fourth standing committee meeting yesterday. The chairman, Gu Keming, reported on the following matters: (1) Sanitation Promotion: For the sake of promoting health education, the YMCA has specifically designated this month, from the 10th to the 16th, as Sanitation Promotion Week. Doctors and experts will be invited to give lectures on health education in the YMCA gymnasium, starting at 7:00 PM each day, with one topic scheduled for each day, to facilitate fundraising and achieve practical results.

<h3 id="e60">Datuan: Situation Unclear <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Datuan Town in Nanhui is the center of the Pudong Guerrilla Force. Japanese forces have been besieging it for days. According to people from Pudong, the situation was very tense for the past two days. Land and water transportation has been cut off. Five Japanese planes flew to reconnoiter the area the day before yesterday and spotted two small motorboats parked on the coast. The 2nd and 8th detachments of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army, stationed nearby, have been contacted and have dispatched reinforcements in two routes to intercept the Japanese forces. Cutting off the Japanese forces has become a segment. The Japanese army is firmly defending Nanqiao. Gunfire and artillery fire from Su and Ri can be clearly heard in the Pudong area.</p>
<h3 id="e61">British Parliamentary China Committee: Focuses on Interests in China; Tired of Government Replies; Believes Japan Should be Retaliated Against <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily, a London dispatch on June 10th stated that the reasons for the slow conclusion of the British-Soviet treaty are now fully understood. Only a few stubborn people still insist that "a hidden hand of anti-communist prejudice" continues to obstruct it. According to Moscow, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania must be guaranteed against aggression, regardless of whether they want this guarantee or not, because the Soviet Union cannot allow them to be invaded by Germany. However, these three Baltic states all want to avoid complications with their powerful neighbors.</p>
<p>Therefore, they announced that they do not want any country to provide guarantees. The Ding Jingle murder case has been published in large headlines by London newspapers, but no editorials have been written to criticize it. Official circles said, "This is indeed a very bad case." Even if Ding fired a shot in a panic (in this situation, his nervousness may have been quite unbearable), the extreme barbarity of the Japanese soldiers' attack and the fact that Ding was detained for fifteen hours after being injured before being sent to the Gongji Hospital cannot be excused simply because Ding fired a shot. The Parliamentary China Committee has now sent a very powerful delegation, including Sir Millen, Lord Moylean Aeribank, Sir Knox, and Sir Santman, scheduled to meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Butler on Monday to inquire about the entire issue of British interests in China. Undoubtedly, the Ding Jingle case will be carefully addressed.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>Members of Parliament</p>
<p>in a sense, feel that there is nothing to choose between the cases. All cases prove that the Japanese are determined to harm and insult Britain as much as possible in any way they can. The only difference is the amount of evidence. As the questions in the House of Commons recently show, members are increasingly tired of hearing the government's repeated, unchanging replies that protests have been sent to the Japanese government. The general public increasingly feels that only some definite retaliation can achieve any remedy. Officials now seem to be moving toward this same conclusion, but everyone is afraid to be overly optimistic.</p>

<p>At around 9:00 AM on the 4th, six Japanese planes invaded Zhenhai and dropped more than thirty bombs, all falling in the wasteland near the fortress. Chinese losses were minimal. Two Japanese warships are currently anchored in the waters off Zhenhai Ligang, without any unusual movements. Local garrison troops are closely monitoring them. The situation in Ningbo and Zhenhai is peaceful as usual, and defenses have been strengthened.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, sources in the shipping industry revealed that three Japanese warships arrived off the coast of Leqing on the morning of the 4th. At around 8:00 AM, they opened fire on the shore and launched several motorboats, full of armed Japanese soldiers, attempting to land under the cover of artillery fire. Local defense forces calmly responded, inflicting a head-on blow. The Japanese army failed to succeed. At the same time, three Japanese planes dropped more than ten bombs in the area, causing minimal damage. Japanese planes have been quite active along the coast of Fujian Province in recent days. At around 9:00 AM on the 4th, twelve Japanese planes bombed the Changmen area of Fuzhou. The extent of the damage is unknown. More than twenty Japanese warships are currently anchored in the Minjiang estuary, and have not left. They occasionally launch motorboats to patrol and spy along the coast. The Chinese military authorities have deployed heavy troops along the coast early on.</p>

<p>Since Dinghai was landed on by the Japanese army on the 23rd of last month, the residents of the city and suburbs have fled completely. The larger shops were mostly broken into by Japanese soldiers, who searched inside. Local hooligans entered and looted after the Japanese army left, so the losses were very heavy. Shops such as Nantai Fengtailong have not been spared.</p>

<p>Fang Tongyuan, the principal of Zhoushan Middle School, and Chen Dehong, the pastor of the Christian Church, have been detained by the Japanese and are now being used to organize a puppet "organization" in the hope of gathering residents who have fled to the countryside. However, very few have returned. At the same time, the Japanese are trying to cooperate with Shenjiamen fish merchants to control the fishing industry, but have also had no success.</p>

<p>The Japanese army occupied the Wuhuailu mansion as its headquarters, and then occupied the Wu and Shao family houses on Beijie and the Pan Rongji building at No. 4 Guanyin Bridge as three branch headquarters. Military telephones were laid out in the four cities. The city gates were closed at night to avoid guerrilla attacks, in a rather desperate situation. At the same time, there was war outside the city at Qingling, Baihu Mountain, Dazhan, and other places.</p>

<p>After Dinghai and Daishan, which belong to the Zhoushan Islands in eastern Zhejiang, were unfortunately occupied by the Japanese army, local self-defense groups and others retreated to the outskirts to continue the resistance. Order in Dinghai remains chaotic, and the war is still ongoing. However, after the Shanghai-Dinghai route was suspended, the Swiss merchant Ruifeng Shipping Company has now chartered the Xin Anli from the British merchant Laisi Shipping Company to operate the Shanghai-Dinghai route, also serving Daishan. It is scheduled to sail from Shanghai for the first time at 4:00 PM today. However, the fares are extremely expensive, with third-class cabins costing eight yuan and staterooms costing twelve yuan. It is heard that Japanese permission has been obtained, but after landing in Dinghai or Daishan, passengers are forced to obtain a so-called "good citizen certificate" from the so-called "Maintenance Association," so people in Dinghai are paying close attention to this.</p>

<p>Shanghai is the hub of international commerce, and the prosperity of commerce can be imagined. In recent years, the population of Shanghai has increased sharply, and commercial trade has also become increasingly prosperous. However, since the westward movement of the National Army, the environment has changed, and customs authority is insufficient, so smuggled goods have flooded the market. It is heard that leaders of the domestic goods industry in this city are paying close attention to these smuggled goods. They have all been carefully studying how to improve the quality of domestic goods, sell them in the market, and, to the extent possible, reduce prices to allow buyers to obtain cheap and high-quality domestic goods. It is also heard that the government is very concerned about the export of domestic goods, and may reduce export tax rates for domestic goods. Therefore, it is predicted that the domestic goods market will develop increasingly in the future.</p>

<p>The newly built five-story mansion held its opening ceremony on the 3rd of this month. All employees wore gold rooster badges on their chests to distinguish them. After signing in, guests were each given a folding fan made by the Sheng Sheng Company, one side with a lotus picking picture painted by Mr. Sun Xueni, and the other side printed with a picture of the pharmacy's new building. Yao Qing and He Song brothers, in memory of the hard work of their father in founding the company, specially set up the "Mr. Yuan Bietang Memorial Hall" on the third floor, with a portrait hanging in the middle and flowers placed underneath. There are eight wooden plaques with maxims on the side, including "Opium smoking is not allowed, it damages the spirit and wastes the career. A moment of pleasure will addict you and cause you lifelong suffering, and you will regret it too late." On the left hangs a picture of Han Kang selling medicine and a couplet presented by Mr. Lin Kanghou. The picture was painted by Xiaoyu, with a sentence inscribed by Xueni saying, "The Yao Qing and He Song brothers, inheriting their father's legacy, have expanded their doors and windows and made them beautiful. At the beginning of the completion, I wish them a limitless future." Dozens of national flags were hung high on the roof and fluttered in the wind, and more than a hundred pots of bonsai made by Mo Wuqi were displayed, small and exquisite, and worthy of appreciation.</p>

<p>A table was specially set up on the fifth floor, with writing tools on it. An old man with a long beard sat upright behind it, with a sign posted next to it saying, "Please invite Mr. Yuan Xilian to write couplets to help with donations, five yuan per couplet. Paper and ink are donated by He Song. The proceeds will be sent to the Fundraising Committee for Sanitation Expenses of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. Guests who wish to have a couplet written, please provide the wording of the upper line so that the calligrapher can write on the spot." Only then did we know that this old man with a long beard was the Jiangnan beggar calligrapher (Mr. Yuan's alias) who was strong in character, not tempted by profit, and willing to live in the shelter to serve as a refugee. He said with a smile to the guests, "If you want to embed the two characters of your name in the couplet, you must commission a special one and pay double the fee to benefit the refugees." So the brothers Yan Bailin and Yan Zhongli paid an extra fee and asked him to write two special couplets. Because of the busyness of writing, they agreed to pick them up the next day. This kind of fundraising method can be called a new approach. In the future, when shops open, they can imitate it to help the refugees. It is worth promoting, so it is presented here to inform compatriots from all walks of life.</p>

He is still under treatment. After investigation, it was found that the accident was caused by Zhang Liansheng's carelessness. When driving on a busy street, he neither followed the rules to drive to the left, nor did he drive at excessive speed. Therefore, the chauffeur should be held responsible for this accident. Wu Heshang hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong and filed a lawsuit against Zhang Liansheng in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court according to Article 284 of the Criminal Law. At the same time, he filed an incidental civil lawsuit against car owner Zhang Wanlai (comprador of Hua Hai Foreign Firm), requesting that they be jointly and severally liable for medical expenses and mental distress compensation of 1,915.40 yuan.

<p>The First Special District Court in Shanghai, Jiangsu, originally had a female prison attached to it, officially named the Second Branch Prison of Jiangsu by the Ministry of Judicial Administration. After the establishment of the Beixinjing Prison, the female prisoners who were to be held there were transferred to Beixinjing Prison for execution of their sentences. The branch prison within the Special Court was effectively reduced to a detention center, so the Ministry ordered the abolition of the branch prison designation and renamed it the Detention Center of the Special First Court, appointing Mr. Wang Baoshan as the director of the detention center and concurrently the director of the Civil Detention Center. After the outbreak of the war, the Beixinjing Prison was destroyed, leaving female prisoners sentenced by the Special First Court with no place to serve their sentences. The detention center had to accept them as a temporary measure. In view of the facts, the Ministry of Judicial Administration specially ordered that the female detention center within the Special First Court be restored to the designation of the Second Branch Prison of Jiangsu. The Second Branch of the High Court ordered that Mr. Wang Baoshan, the original director of the detention center, be promoted to warden of the branch prison and concurrently the director of the Civil Detention Center. Mr. Wang took office the other morning after receiving the appointment.</p>

<p>No. 130, Edward Road, Public Concession, is rented by Zhuang Zhiliang. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, Zhuang has taken advantage of the opportunity to divide all the houses, separate them, number them, and rent them out by the room. The rent he receives has increased several times compared to before the war. Last year, Zhuang suddenly announced a 30% rent increase. The tenants endured it to avoid disputes at the time. Unexpectedly, Zhuang Zhiliang recently announced to all tenants that the rent would be increased by another 35%. The tenants refused because Zhuang was greedy and insatiable and they could not afford it. However, Zhuang threatened to cut off the electricity. At 7:30 PM last Friday, Zhuang Quansheng, the owner of the Ranji Company (in room No. 202 of that address), argued reasonably with Zhuang Zhiliang, which angered him.

<p>Although the Japanese attempt to control the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been met with fierce resistance from all parties, it has not been forgotten. The Hongyun Ship once joined the Northern Jiangsu Line to conduct a trial voyage to test the opinions of all parties. Unexpectedly, it was robbed by pirates in the Haihonggang waters and its machinery was damaged, so it has been suspended. The Hongyun Ship sailed to Shanghai to enter the dock for repairs. According to shipping industry sources, the Japanese army recently blockaded the Northern Jiangsu port, and foreign ships sailing to Jiangsu use Qinglong Port as the terminal. Everything is controlled by the Japanese army. The Nisshin Company is in the process of sending ships to join the Northern Jiangsu Line to compete. After the Nisshin Shipping vessels sail, the business of foreign merchant ships will be severely hit and it will be difficult to maintain. Therefore, the German companies have requested the German Consulate General to negotiate with the Japanese to restore navigation to the Northern Jiangsu port. It is said that the German Consul General has submitted a negotiation to the Japanese Consul, but Miura claimed that this matter is the responsibility of the Japanese naval authorities and will be handled after notifying the naval authorities. Therefore, no progress has been made. It is said that the German Consulate General will submit another negotiation in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that, according to relayed postal news from here, the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry accused the local customs authorities of "lack of sincerity" and has now decided to apply to the Tokyo government to take steps to "accelerate" the passage of Japanese goods through the local customs. It is not known what decision was reached at a special meeting held by the Ministry of Communications on Tuesday of last week after the application was submitted. Due to slow customs inspections, more than 10,000 tons of Japanese goods have been blocked in the warehouses of the Japan Mail Ship Company and other merchants in this city. The volume of goods shipped from Japan to Shanghai each month is 40,000 to 60,000 tons. The statement from the Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry also stated that although Japan took over the customs soon after occupying Shanghai, most of the customs officers are still British and Chinese, some of whom are anti-Japanese and deliberately delay customs procedures for goods shipped out of Japan.</p>

If anyone sees them, please send them to their homes. A small reward will be offered so that their families can be reunited.</p>

The price per [unit of measure] has increased by two to three yuan. However, the city has sufficient inventory, and goods have also been transported from other places, so there should be no shortage.</p>

On one hand, they used the original tax amount to fund military expenses, which has been quite effective for two years. Since occupying Pinghu, Zhangyan, Tinglin, Nanjiao, and other coastal areas, the Japanese have aimed solely at seizing the coastal salt tax. However, due to the activity of the guerrillas, they dared not try. Now, as the hot season approaches, the peak salt production period, the Japanese, seeing great profit, cannot wait. Last month, they first transferred over a thousand newly trained puppet tax police from Nanjing as a follow-up to occupying the producing areas. Unexpectedly, a portion of the puppet tax police stationed in Nanjiao revolted first. Many of those in Zhangyan also abandoned their weapons and fled. Seeing their plans about to fail, the Japanese, disregarding everything, sent two large detachments from Hangzhou on the 2nd of this month, heading to Jinshanwei via Zhujing. They also transferred three hundred puppet police from Songjiang to occupy Ruanxiang and Zhalin. On one hand, they transferred a small naval detachment from Shanghai, Zhoupu, and other places to attack Qicangdun, Ping'an, Qianjiaqiao, and other places, attempting to completely seize the Punan salt region. Therefore, in recent days, the coastal areas have been very chaotic. The Zhalin area was originally within the Japanese sphere of influence, and the guerrillas had automatically withdrawn. However, the salt workers were unwilling to obey and had mostly destroyed their salt stoves and drying fields. The guerrillas had also long blocked the salt transport canals, making both production and transport difficult for the Japanese, and it may take three to four months to recover.</p>
<p>After the revolt of the puppet police in Nanjiao, the Japanese mobilized a large force to attack, in addition to seizing the coastal salt tax, and continued to implement their "mopping-up" plan (the Japanese had already launched two large-scale invasions against the guerrillas in Punan). Therefore, along the Punan area, there were dense formations of troops searching in various directions. On the 2nd of this month, more than two hundred Japanese soldiers landed from Zhangang and attacked Lujiahui, which is defended by the 8th Detachment of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army. The detachment knew that a direct confrontation would be difficult to win, so they divided their machine gun teams and ambushed them at the vital water and land crossings that the Japanese troops would have to pass through, using the reeds on both banks as cover. They also set up heavy artillery behind the Chen family tomb. On one hand, they used the old, weak, and disabled soldiers to lure the enemy along the road. The Japanese, unaware of the trap, charged forward, and the ambushers attacked from both sides. Shells flew densely, killing more than fifty people on the spot and capturing many military supplies. The Japanese troops retreated in panic and were attacked by the Provincial Security Team near Zhangang, almost leaving no one unscathed. Such surprising and victorious tactics are the usual skills of the Loyal and Righteous Army in Peinan, and this is not the first time they have won.</p>
<p>The self-defense corps organized by the governments of Shanghai, Jiading, and other ten counties under the district supervisory commissioner has been approved by the provincial government and uniformly organized into the District Provincial Security Brigade. The five counties in southeastern Pudong each formed a brigade, led by their respective county magistrates. Coastal areas not under the jurisdiction of the Loyal and Righteous Army were incorporated by the Shanghai-Songhu Military Commissioner as supplementary troops for the regular army. It is now known that the coastal defense areas in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been ordered by the War Zone Commander to be under the command of the military commissioner. The district's military affairs are considered the most important. Therefore, the military commissioner convened a meeting in a certain place to give instructions and charged the district supervisory commissioner with concurrent responsibility for handling the matter. It is heard that the commissioner has established a Provincial Security District Command in a certain place and personally supervised the battle near Jinshanwei, eighteen away, the day before yesterday. The Japanese troops, newly transferred from Hangzhou, numbered more than five hundred. Some were conscripted locally and forced to the front lines. Because they did not obey orders, they were machine-gunned from behind by the Japanese, resulting in more than half of them being killed or wounded, which was extremely cruel. More than twenty people, including Zhang Gonghu, who were responsible for the right-wing assault, were far away and killed the Japanese instructor, leading their troops to defect to the Chinese side. According to them, in the occupied areas, the puppet government forcibly conscripted people into the army under the pretext of recruiting police. They were trained in Hangzhou for two months and then driven to fight.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Various Businesses on North Shansi Road Request the Prohibition of Street Vendors <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Various businesses on North Shansi Road believe that the increasing number of street vendors on the road is seriously hindering traffic, sanitation, and business operations. They have listed six reasons and requested the Shanghai Municipal Council's 36th District Branch to forward them to the Public Works Department for adoption, moving the street vendors into the vegetable markets. The reasons cited by the businesses are as follows: (1) Regarding traffic: The road is a major transportation artery, and setting up stalls along the road will inevitably hinder traffic and affect road administration, which contradicts the Municipal Council's safety campaign. (2) Regarding sanitation: The shops along the road all face the road. If the road surface is unclean, it will easily attract flies, and the foul odor inhaled will easily cause illness. Therefore, setting up stalls along the road not only hinders traffic but also affects sanitation. (3) Regarding the supply of vegetables: The so-called North Hongkou district, with an area of less than one square mile, already has three vegetable markets (Burton Road, Edinburgh Road, North Fukien Road). Business is usually very slow. Although the population has recently increased sharply, the overall area is small, and the vegetable markets are still one-third empty. The Burton Road vegetable market can still accommodate 60 stalls, Edinburgh Road can accommodate 30 stalls, and North Fukien Road can accommodate 120 stalls. This situation shows that although the population has increased, the increase in demand is not significant. (4) Regarding the livelihood of street vendors: Street vendors are mostly coolies and should be given relief. The Public Works Department should use its power to accommodate them as much as possible in various vegetable markets. This would not only relieve the street vendors but also rectify road administration. It is also necessary to investigate the business of each vegetable market to determine the elements of supply and demand. This is the way to guarantee the permanent livelihood of the street vendors. (5) Regarding the legal issue of licenses: The street vendors along the road mostly have shoulder-carrying licenses, which only allow hawking and not setting up stalls. If an exception is made to allow them to set up stalls, can it be guaranteed that there will be no imitators? It is feared that once implemented, Nanking Road will also become a peddler's street. If they are given licenses to set up stalls, then nearly ten thousand peddlers in the city will have to change their licenses. Therefore, the precedent cannot be broken. The only good solution is to have them move into the vegetable markets. (6) Regarding hindering the business of others: The shops along North Shansi Road are all tax-paying citizens and should be protected by the Municipal Council. In this hot summer, they can only rely on the relatively cool mornings to do business. Now, obstructing traffic and hindering business at this time will cause significant losses.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Taiwan Incident <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that Taiwanese aborigines massacred Ryukyu refugees, and Japan dispatched over seven hundred troops to Taiwan for negotiations. Upon hearing this news, China also dispatched an imperial envoy to the interior tribes to investigate the situation. The aborigines surrounded and cheered, claiming that the Japanese were abusive and that they were willing to be the vanguard. When asked about the refugee case, they claimed that there was no killing. Because the refugees were willing to work as servants, the imperial commissioner ordered them to be handed over and successively released more than twenty refugees, who were now properly cared for as witnesses. Then, he proclaimed the emperor's virtue, saying that he would order protection in the future. The aborigines cried bitterly, like young children clinging to their loving parents. The imperial commissioner consoled them and rewarded them with red silk and other items. After returning to the camp, various tribes submitted petitions, willing to be converted to civilization, establish officials, and pay taxes, totaling about two hundred and fifty tribes. They presented household registration books, totaling more than one million four hundred thousand people. Among them, dozens of tribes requested to be granted surnames, and requested the establishment of control, the distribution of weapons, and the appointment of officials to lead them to fight to the death with the Japanese. The imperial commissioner instructed them to prepare first and wait for deployment. All the tribal chiefs jumped and sang for joy! They all said that they did not expect to see the majesty of the imperial commissioner again today and to be able to serve the Holy Dynasty. When the Japanese troops arrived in Taiwan, the first time they entered the mountains, they suddenly encountered an aboriginal woman over fifty years old, who commanded more than two hundred soldiers to surround and capture her from all sides, but they still failed to catch her. On the way back, they encountered a sick aboriginal girl, only eleven or twelve years old, and sang triumphantly to present her as a captive, holding a grand banquet. They praised the aborigines for having magic, which could change unpredictably.</p>

<p>The public garden in Hongkou does not prohibit people from visiting, but prohibits picking flowers. Because famous flowers and exotic grasses, with their vibrant colors, would be gone in a moment if they could be picked. But offenders are almost daily. The constable, tired of it, reported to the French consul yesterday, intending to increase the punishment, placing a cangue on the garden gate for a day, so that people would know to fear it. Sima Chen believed that picking flowers was a minor matter and should not be severely punished. The only option was to draw a picture of a cangue, indicating that violators would be treated accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Overview of the Adjustment and Establishment of National Higher Education Colleges and Departments: Adjustment of Colleges and Departments in More Than Thirty Schools: Unified Training of Middle School Teachers <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>(Special Chongqing Dispatch) Since the relocation of national colleges and universities above the junior college level to the rear during the war, there are now ninety-five schools (excluding several newly established schools). The distribution is as previously reported. The establishment of colleges and departments in colleges and universities above the junior college level (including universities, independent colleges, and junior colleges) has lacked a certain standard in the past. In the same location, there are many duplications in the colleges and departments of various schools. Some of them also have overly simple equipment or lack a central goal and are not suitable for social needs. After the outbreak of the war, the situation has become even worse than before as most schools have relocated to the interior. The Ministry of Education is therefore merging duplicates, appropriately abolishing rudimentary ones, and adding specific regulations to those lacking a central goal. According to this adjustment of colleges and departments, there are more than thirty schools. In order to train teachers, the normal college system has been established. The education colleges and departments of private universities and colleges in various provinces that have achieved excellent results will determine their teaching scope and specifically train vocational and social teachers. The rest will be ordered to stop enrolling new students and gradually close down in order to unify the training of teachers in secondary schools across the country. At present, there are eighty-eight types of colleges and departments in colleges and universities above the junior college level, with five hundred and nineteen departments; and forty-five types of junior colleges and vocational schools, with seventy-seven courses. Among them, colleges and departments of arts and sciences are the most numerous (thirty-seven colleges, one hundred and fourteen departments in arts; thirty-four colleges, one hundred and eight departments in science), followed by law, medicine, and engineering (twenty-two colleges, ninety-six departments in law; twenty-one colleges, no departments divided in medicine; eighteen colleges, eighty departments in engineering). Education, commerce, and agriculture are the least numerous (twelve colleges, forty-seven departments in education and normal; fourteen colleges, thirty-five departments in commerce; ten colleges, thirty-nine departments in agriculture). There are more engineering and medical courses in junior colleges (both fifteen courses), followed by normal, arts, and commerce (thirteen courses in both normal and arts, eleven courses in commerce), and agriculture is the least numerous (ten courses). This situation still needs to be adjusted. The statistics of colleges, departments, and courses in the twenty-seventh year are listed below.</p>

<p>From the above statistics, it is clear that not only are colleges and departments duplicated in the same region, but the names, nature, and number of establishments also need to be adjusted. In addition to the more than thirty schools that have already been adjusted, it is heard that the Ministry of Education plans to gradually adjust those that have not yet been adjusted.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Communication) In addition to the educational films supplied by the Ministry of Education on a regular basis, the education departments of various provinces also purchase a lot of their own and produce educational films about the province's geographical scenery and production for screening. Recently, the Ministry of Education investigated the number of educational films purchased and produced by the education departments of various provinces across the country. The results showed that among the provinces that have reported, the Fujian Provincial Department of Education has the most, with a total of eighty-eight types. Among them, fifty-seven types were produced by the department itself. Most of the province's political, educational, industrial, social training, geographical scenery, and war mobilization aspects have been made into films. Due to its excellent results, the Ministry of Education has commended it and ordered it to send a duplicate of each of the films produced by itself to the Ministry for distribution to other provinces.</p>

<h3 id="e127">National Jiangsu Medical College: Relocation to Sichuan and Commencement of Classes <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Communication) Since the National Jiangsu Medical College was merged and reorganized in Yuanling last August, it has been striving to improve college affairs and enrich teaching in order to give play to wartime medical education. Due to the shift in the war situation, it was submitted and approved to relocate. Faculty and students traveled arduously and temporarily resided in Guiyang for classes. On one hand, President Hu Dingan, in accordance with the Ministry's intention to develop the medical and educational foundation in Chongqing, looked for college buildings in a certain place in Chongqing. After several consultations, it was decided to purchase a building as a college building. The environment is beautiful, and the architecture is solid and simple. Since April 22 this year, they have gradually moved in for use, and on May 23, they began to resume classes in the new college building. There are more than two hundred and forty students. They are now planning to build a library, laboratories, and dormitories for male and female students. It is heard that the college's goals for the future are: (1) To enrich equipment, pay attention to the research of basic medical subjects, and seek to develop medical education related to national defense and production, such as the trial planting of domestic drugs. A drug trial planting farm is being planned; (2) To strictly manage and train, strengthen the implementation of military management and the tutor system, so that all faculty and students can realize a clean, tidy, simple, and hardworking new life under the same purpose, and will use their spare time to engage in the promotion of social education, with particular emphasis on the inculcation of health education. The planning has begun. As for the affiliated hospital, it is decided to cooperate with the Chongqing branch of the World Red Cross, which will be located in the suburbs of Chongqing. The association will supply the equipment, and the college will undertake medical and technical work. Clinical practice for fourth- and fifth-year students will also be undertaken by the affiliated hospital. Once the preparations are in place, fourth- and fifth-year students will move to Chongqing for classes in order to facilitate teaching.</p>

<p>In order to use the holidays and promote group living, the Boys' Department of the Shanghai Chinese Christian Young Men's Association is organizing a boys' summer camp to develop the boys' physical and mental health. However, due to the large population of the city, a suitable location could not be found for a while, so it has been delayed. It is now learned that the association has recently reached an agreement with St. John's University to use the university's campus as the camp site. Not only is it shaded by green trees, but it also has swimming pools, sports fields, and other facilities. The environment is beautiful and the equipment is complete.

<h3 id="e140">Finance - Discount Rates Continue to Rise - Gold Market Difficult to Activate <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for raw gold saw relatively flat price fluctuations, hovering around 2,560 yuan throughout the day. The general trend was first up and then down. Although cash shops initially sold off frequently, the Huainan gang's appetite remained strong, and retail investors also bought in well, keeping the market relatively firm. Later, due to the discount rate for remittances rising further to over 100 yuan, buyers' interest waned sharply. In addition, securities firms, a certain bank, and cash shops competed to sell off, and the market outlook immediately turned weak. At one point, it fell to a low of 2,514 yuan before rebounding to 2,560 yuan at the close. The overall result was a slight decline. Transactions were mostly scattered and few, with only about 600 taels traded throughout the day. Gold jewelry shops remained inactive, and overseas group gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Unchanged Since Morning</p>
<p>Since the morning, the cash shops were eager to buy each bar (ten taels), but a certain gold shop was acting as an agent for the Huainan gang, and retail investors also had an appetite for raw gold, so the market was stable. The morning opening was two yuan higher than the previous day. A certain cash shop bought twenty taels from a money exchange shop at a price of 2,562 yuan. Subsequently, another cash shop sold fifty taels to a certain gold shop (acting as an agent for the Huainan gang) at the same price. Soon after, another cash shop sold twenty taels to a fellow merchant at a price of 63 yuan. At this time, a certain gold shop (acting as an agent for speculators) suddenly began to sell off, and the market weakened slightly, briefly dropping three yuan. A base gold shop sold fifty taels to a fellow merchant (the buyer was acting as an agent for the Huainan gang) at a price of 60 yuan. At this time, the Huainan gang's buying interest remained strong, and retail investors' buying power increased, so the underlying trend turned upward. Silverware shops bought thirty taels from a certain bank at a price of 61 yuan. Subsequently, cash shops did business with each other for fifty taels at a price of 62 yuan. After this, there were fewer sellers, and under the momentary buying spree, it rose five yuan again. A certain bank bought forty taels from a cash shop, and a securities firm bought ten taels from a money exchange shop, both at a price of 67 yuan. At that time, a certain bank suddenly stopped buying and started selling off, and general buyers avoided the market as the discount rate for remittances had risen to over 100 yuan, so buying interest suddenly waned, and the market price fell back down. A certain bank sold thirty taels to a silverware shop at a price of 65 yuan. A cash shop sold ten taels to a certain broker at a price of 63 yuan. At that time, securities firms also started a selling spree, and as buyers watched and did not advance, the downtrend became severe, dropping six yuan. An entire army of firms sold ten taels to gold shops at a price of 57 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms sold fifty taels to money exchange shops at a price of 56 yuan. Later, a certain bank sold thirty taels to money exchange shops at a price of 55 yuan. At the fifth hour, securities firms sold ten taels to gold shops again. 56 yuan was the closing price for the morning. The afternoon opening remained weak, opening two yuan lower. Gold shops sold fifty taels to money exchange shops at a price of 54 yuan. Later, cash shops sold fifty taels to money exchange shops at a price of 55 yuan. After this, the market became calm and sluggish. Around three o'clock, it suddenly turned firm, soaring five yuan. Silverware shops did business with each other for fifty taels. 2,560 yuan was the closing price for the evening. As a result, there was no change from the previous day. The price of the cash shops' own-brand gold sold for 2,570 yuan and was bought back for 2,555 yuan. The current standard gold is priced about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there was little activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Remains at Original Price</p>
<p>The price of jewelry gold per tael did not change because the raw gold market was fluctuating. Da Tonghang was still priced at 259 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was priced at 257 yuan, with a buying price of 251 yuan.</p>
<p>Central Pure Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 4th, English pure gold was priced at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 6 and a half pence per ounce, so the Central Bank's buying and selling price of Chinese cash remained at 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold remained at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained stagnant at 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Foreign Exchange Futures Had a Lot of Selling - Swap Spreads Seen Narrowing Again <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged. In the gray market, the situation was that foreign firms were not closing out many accounts, and foreign exchange firms were quite willing to sell off, especially US dollars, causing an underlying trend. Because foreign firms were settling US dollars with a slightly firmer tone, there was still little change along the way. In the July futures market, the Chinese banks' selling interest suddenly increased sharply. Coupled with the fact that foreign banks' appetite was not good, and sales were particularly high, both British and US exchange rates rose firmly. Therefore, swap spreads were gradually narrowing. At the fifth hour, the spot rate swapped for July was 1.875 for British gold and 3.4375 for US dollars, which is equivalent to a foreign exchange firm's monthly interest rate of about three points, while arbitrageurs actually only made one and a half points (all calculated for 26 days). In half-day trading, the futures market was still strong, and the spot market was relatively quiet. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, foreign exchange firms' selling interest was also high, so it also increased by 1.125.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London long-term rate contracted by 3.125 in the near term, and the long-term rate continued to fall by 0.0625. The New York silver price was closed. The London raw gold remained flat. The exchange rate against the US dollar did not change, and the exchange rate against Shanghai fell by 1.125. The exchange rate between the US dollar and other foreign currencies was closed, with no market. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the bank's morning opening, the spot selling price of British exchange was 6 pence 5625, and the spot selling price of US exchange was 12 yuan 75, both of which were unchanged from the previous closing. After the opening, foreign firms first settled HSBC's spot British gold at 6 pence 5625, and then foreign firms bought and settled China-Belgium Bank's spot US exchange at 12 yuan 78125. In the process, the British exchange rate was flat, while the US exchange rate was firm. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, they remained unchanged, and when the silver balance tax was announced, it was still exempt. After this, Chinese banks frequently and fiercely sold off July futures. Coupled with the fact that foreign banks' appetite was sluggish and selling interest was good, the market trend was loose. It is estimated that the Chinese banks and the foreign China-Belgium-Dutch bank sold British gold for July from 6 pence 3475 to 6 pence 375, and also sold US exchange for the same month, from 12 yuan 375 loose to 12 yuan 40625. At that time, foreign banks also did business with each other for July US exchange, at 12 yuan 4375. Near the fifth hour, it was heard that the Hong Kong exchange rate also firmed, with the current spot selling price at 40 yuan 25. By the afternoon closing, the bank's spot selling price of British exchange was 6 pence 5625, and the spot selling price of US exchange was 12 yuan 78125. The selling price of British gold for July was 6 pence 375, and the selling price of US exchange was 12 yuan 4375. Compared with last night's closing, the spot British exchange was flat and the US exchange was down 0.03125, the swap was down 0.0625, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was up 1.125 according to the bank's selling price. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, English pure gold was unchanged, and the English-US exchange rate was closed for the holiday, with no market. Foreign exchange firms in the local area had strong demand for closing accounts, and foreign banks provided ample supply. The market was flat for English exchange and loose for US exchange. The English exchange rate remained at 6 pence 5625, and the US exchange rate was 12 yuan 78125, continuing to fall by 0.03125 from the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. When raw gold opened, customers had strong buying interest, doing business at 2,562 yuan. After that, demand was even stronger, and the market was quite bullish, rising to a high price of 67 yuan. Many people took advantage of the high price to sell off, and money exchange shops were also eager to sell, causing the market to turn weak. In the afternoon, it was 56 yuan. At the afternoon opening, gold shops and customers took advantage of the low price to buy in. The evening closing was 2,560 yuan, with no change from the previous day. There was little supply and demand for foreign currencies English and US gold pounds, and the market was sluggish. Transactions in English and US gold were very active. English gold drafts did not change, and US gold drafts fell due to the loose exchange rate. Demand for drafts from Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Netherlands increased, and current prices rose slightly. Supply of drafts from France, Canada, and the Philippines was relatively abundant, and continued to decline. Demand for Japanese gold drafts was scarce, and the market price eased slightly to 9 jiao 9 fen 4 li. Korean drafts were very weak at 8 jiao 7 fen 5 li. Association transactions were not active. Xiang Kang sold 50 pounds of English gold drafts to Tongyuan, and Houji sold 30 pounds of English gold drafts to Changtai, and also sold 50 pounds of English gold drafts to Tongyuan. Yesterday's market prices saw US dollar drafts drop by 5 fen 5 li, Hong Kong drafts rise by 5 li, French franc drafts drop by 7 hao and a half, Singapore drafts and Dutch drafts each rise by 5 fen, and Canadian drafts and Philippine drafts each drop by 5 fen. All other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Discount Rates Once Rose Sharply - Gradually Fell Back in the Afternoon <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts first rose and then fell slightly. At one point, it broke through the 100 yuan mark. In the morning, it rose from around 95 yuan per thousand to a high of 105 yuan. In the afternoon, the use of cash decreased sharply, and it immediately fell back to 95 yuan, which was still 2 yuan and a half higher than the previous day. The money industry association's interbank interest rate did not change, and was listed at 2 jiao in both the morning and afternoon, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e144">English-Indian Silver Seen Declining Again <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 4th, a small number of speculators sold off in the silver market, and there was a lack of maintenance. The market was still flat after the closing. India bought in the near term at the listed price. The short-term long rate contracted by 3.125, and the long-term rate continued to fall by 0.0625. The New York silver price was closed. Also, according to a Mumbai silver telegram, the Indian silver market was weak again. Both the spot price and the July price fell by 8 anna, while the August price fell by a small 5 anna. A total of seven contracts were traded.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Securities - Government Bonds Rise Again <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The gray market for securities saw a gradual recovery yesterday, and the trends of various bonds showed signs of revival. Some people thought that they would tend to fluctuate, but this was a superficial view. The interest payments were suddenly injured by rumors and had unexpected changes, causing the price market to plummet by more than ten yuan, and then later rebounding by several yuan. If it is said that these interest payments will not be paid, then a drop of ten or eight yuan would not be too much. If it is said that the interest payments will not be interrupted, then although the rebound cannot immediately reach the highest price of June 13, it will not be much different. However, although it is known that something will not be interrupted, the holder of the bill is still uneasy before the authorities announce it. However, as the deadline approaches, the truth will be revealed, so it is not easy to fluctuate. Sure enough, yesterday a certain major bank received a telegram from Chongqing that the seventh interest payment will be paid as scheduled, but the remittance will be changed to bank drafts. This has already happened before, enough to quell the desire to kill. Therefore, yesterday's market continued to rise by about two yuan. The gray market was particularly firm in the afternoon. The most lively trading was the market buying to help a certain financial group, Lianhe, cover short positions. Tiansheng and Dexue also bought in considerably, and retail investors' appetite was also quite strong. Some of the sellers were new multi-gainers selling off, and some were slightly seeking cash for economic reasons, but the number was still very limited. No. 20 and No. 35 sold off more, and Yongkang and Hengxue only sold a few. The total number of transactions was about 400,000 yuan. As a result, the market price continued to rise by 1 yuan 1 jiao to 2 yuan 2 jiao. A simple table is listed below. The market will close at noon due to the heat, and will resume after the autumn cools down.</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Price</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Unified A | 58.00 | 56.00 | 58.00 | Up 2.20</p>
<p>Unified B | 49.45 | 48.10 | 49.40 | Up 1.80</p>
<p>Unified C | 48.10 | 48.0 | 48.05 | Up 1.50</p>
<p>Unified D | 47.10 | 47.00 | 46.05 | Up 1.21</p>
<p>Unified E | 47.60 | 46.15 | 47.60 | Up 1.60</p>
<p>The stock market was still sluggish yesterday, but there was slightly more demand, and sellers were holding back. Jardine stocks made slight progress, and other stocks were stable. The stock market is waiting to see how the external situation develops, especially the current development of the European political situation, which seems to be related to the stock markets of exchanges around the world. Economic and financial issues are currently being put aside temporarily, pending further changes in the political situation.</p>
<p>The listed prices of British companies' Far East stocks in London on the 4th of this month (Tuesday) were generally stable. Only the Kailan Mining stock rose by three pence, with a price of 18 shillings.</p>

<p>The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts in London on the 4th of this month (Tuesday) were generally stable, and the market prices remained unchanged. There were physical goods for sale in the UK, including £2,000 of post-war British bonds and £2,000 of French bonds with stamps, with a selling price of £31 and a half, priced £1 and a half lower than British bonds. There were also £2,000 of Belgian bonds with stamps, with a selling price of £29, priced £4 lower than British bonds. There were also £2,000 of German bonds with stamps, with a selling price of £27 and a half, priced £5 and a half lower than British bonds.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Temporary Suspension of China-Belgium Debt Interest <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The 6% Sino-Belgium US Dollar Bonds, secured by customs duties, held their 23rd drawing on June 1st at the China-Belgium Bank headquarters. The winning numbers, etc., were detailed in this newspaper a few days ago. The principal and interest due on July 1st totaled US$236,767. Following the statement made by the Chongqing Ministry of Finance spokesman to the Reuters reporter on June 30 that interest and principal payments on the Post-War Reconstruction Gold Bonds due on July 1st would be suspended and that interest and principal payments on bonds secured by customs surplus would also be temporarily suspended, it became questionable whether the interest and principal payments on the Sino-Belgium bonds would be paid on schedule. The reporter inquired at the China-Belgium Bank, the agency responsible for paying the interest and principal, yesterday and was told that the funds had not yet been allocated, so payments would be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Cotton Yarn   Yarn Pledges Expire, Settlement at Market Price   Double Horse Yarn Falls by Ten Dollars or More   Japanese Yarn Prices Also Drop Slightly <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is sluggish, and the downward trend is intensifying.  After the promulgation of new financial stabilization measures, credit has tightened.  Goods with expiring pledges can no longer be re-pledged for extensions.  Moreover, there's an urgent rush to redeem them.  Due to this weakness and lack of support, sellers are forced to settle at market prices, further disrupting the market.  A major player, for example, harbored thoughts of boosting prices, but was unable to realize them due to environmental constraints.  His market activities have decreased compared to before, causing the market to trend downwards.  20-count Double Horse yarn fell by over ten dollars.  However, certain entities remain unmoved, it is said.</p>
<p>The current yarn situation: The market opened with a scattered and disoriented atmosphere, and everyone was hesitant.  Although the Guangdong buyers had appetite, it wasn't as robust as before.  The opening price fell by eight dollars, with 20-count Double Horse yarn quoted at 488 dollars for outside godown delivery.  Hong Kong buyers only purchased 20 bales.  Recognizing the unfavorable market conditions, ticket holders were eager to sell, causing the market to decline further to 484 dollars, with godown warrants priced at 480 dollars.  The major player began to reappear, offering support at low prices.  However, due to credit constraints, he couldn't act as he pleased.  After the close, sellers continued to unload their holdings, but buyers were scarce, and no compromise was reached.  It's recorded that various buying groups purchased a total of 1,115 bales during the half-day session.  20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 11 dollars, Double Globe by 2.5 dollars, Special Jin Cheng by 7 dollars, and 10-count coarse yarn also fell by 3.7 dollars.  The quantity purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 475 Fellow Traders 450 Mainland 110 Yunnan 80 Total 1,115</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market has turned downward.  The discount rate on banknotes has risen again, and sales are also affected.  Market prices have dropped slightly.  20-count Yueqin is currently quoted at 405 dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Sino-Foreign Cotton Transactions   Yesterday Saw a Slight Improvement   Selling Prices Were Looser <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Cotton transactions showed some activity, but the volume of transactions was minimal.  Factories showed no interest in purchasing.  Fellow traders showed some interest, but most of this cotton was resold to other factories to settle transactions.  However, trading among foreign cotton traders was more active, but selling prices were looser than before the closure.  This was mainly due to the tightening of banknotes.  Supplies from Subei were very scarce.  Only 60 bales of Xia Sha cotton arrived at the docks.  The current cotton transaction details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Wistend 96.00 Fellow traders purchase 800 pieces Payment via banknotes for godown delivery</p>
<p>Xin Te Hua 78.50 Also 300 pieces Also cash</p>
<p>Xia Sha American Cotton 88.00 86.50 Also 200 bales Delivery at the wharf via bank transfer</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was closed yesterday. However, a local firm's telegram predicted no movement. The Indian cotton market was also very sluggish. The Indian monsoon season has already begun, significantly impacting cotton yields. Yesterday, Indian cotton rose by 2 rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by over 10 pounds.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai are becoming increasingly narrow. Even paying due funds for all arriving ships is proving difficult. The premium on cash increased again yesterday, making it even more difficult for all parties to raise funds. A Qingdao trader, seeing the strong demand for cotton in North China, purchased 800 bales of current cargo Compo cotton, with a godown delivery price of 96 dollars, enlivening foreign cotton transactions since the reopening of customs.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Grains   Flour Transactions Subside   New Wheat Being Bought by Certain Parties <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Flour Yesterday morning was quieter than ever. Both northern and southern merchants were affected by the current situation and the cash problem, and it is feared that a turnaround will be difficult to achieve in the short term. Apart from a few sporadic touches, there has been no wholesale volume sold, and manufacturers are planning to stand by and wait for opportunities. Therefore, No. 2 flour remains at 4 dollars 65 cents in cash and refuses to accept transfers, and the market remains in a wait-and-see situation. As for the retail transactions in this street, after the market closed, the purchases were once stronger, but yesterday due to the urgent need for money and the high discount rate for transfers, the transactions also decreased from more than 10,000 bags to 6,000 to 7,000 bags, it is said.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday, the supply of new wheat was slightly higher than before, with about 2,000 bags arriving by wheeled transport. However, the goods and the production areas have also been purchased by certain parties, and there are often messages from across the border, so they are all insistent and unwilling to relax. The market relies on stability. Unified sales opened at 6 dollars 73 cents for Nanjing wheat, 78 cents for Danyang wheat, 88 cents for Suzhou wheat, and 78 cents for Kunshan wheat. More than 1,600 bags were transacted, still purchased by local hoarders and Japanese factories. The market is still firm.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Shanghai Rice Outflow <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Du Geng Yesterday, river bottom rice from various merchants arrived, totaling 1,200 to 1,300 wheeled bags. After reports from Wu that the area was closed off, people's hearts were still firm and the route out was very lively. Sellers are holding out, so the market continues to rise by 2 cents. Although the sales of thick and thin Geng rice in this street are also active, they are not as popular as Wu pointed rice. However, the owners are very determined and the market presents a tight situation. Du Yang pointed rice is similar to the Geng rice market. There is still slack in the route out and it remains weak. Observing the trend of the rice market, in terms of existing inventory, it has been decreasing day by day recently. According to a rice industry survey report, there are still about 400,000 stones, of which 50,000 stones have been sold to the interior and various places within the past week. The sources from various places are mostly blocked. Shanghai rice merchants only care about their own interests and are willing to sell the Shanghai stock of grain to other places. If the rice market has a major impact in the future, rice merchants should be held jointly responsible. The authorities should also prevent the outflow as early as possible to protect the food supply in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Because of rumors of the closure of Wuhu, people's hearts were trending upward again, and merchants and hoarders, seeing the digestion of Ke Xian rice not weakening, all seized the opportunity to get a higher price. Medium-grade broken rice, in the rice market, was even more welcomed by inland merchants: broken rice at about 16 dollars, milled rice at 15 dollars 50 to 60 cents, and brown rice at about 14 dollars were all absorbed by inland merchants. Purchases from rural villages and the shops on this street are also keen and the market continues to rise by 10 to 20 cents. The number of transactions is still more than 4,000 bags, most of which are handled by inland merchants.</p>
<p>Yang Rice Deliveries from set orders have yet to arrive, and the existing Saigon inventory on the market is gradually decreasing. Yesterday, about 200 bags were transacted in the market, and the price was raised by nearly 1 cent. The price opened at 23 dollars 15 cents. However, foreign merchants are still continuing to promote sales, and there are reports of two telegrams being sent out, and a reply and proper delivery may be expected within this week.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Silk and Tea   New York Closed, Local Silk Trading Not Smooth <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York was closed due to the Democratic Festival. Yokohama silk prices for spot goods fluctuated around 1,200 yuan, and there was no sign of firmness or decline. Although there are rumors that silk stocks in New York are decreasing, it is now the peak month for the appearance of new silk, and both buyers and sellers feel that maintaining the current market price is the most advisable strategy until the relationship between supply and demand changes. Therefore, Yokohama silk prices rose and fell alternately, and the fluctuations were minimal. The spot price was 1,195 yuan, the forward price was 1,130 yuan, and the recent price was 1,175 yuan, which was slightly more than 10 yuan lower than the previous market. However, in the afternoon, it rose by 5 to 10 yuan.</p>
<p>It is said that a portion of fresh cocoons can now be exported from the local silk market, so the market is slightly excited. However, yesterday's silk trading was not smooth due to the closure of the US market. White filature silk, etc., opened with 50 dan, and the market price did not fluctuate greatly. The market price of Ji Li silk can be expected to be firm upwards, because Ji Li silk has not risen sharply since the exchange rate changed.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Green Tea Trading is Booming <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British and French merchants of green tea, in view of the huge demand from abroad, unanimously started searching for goods, and trading became even more vigorous. It still seems that the "Chouxin" category of "Zhen Mei" tea is the most popular. The whole city bought more than 1,300 boxes of green tea from Xiehe, Yihuo, Tongfu, Baochang, and other firms. "Chouxin" was sold at prices ranging from 305 to 346 yuan, "Tong Zhen Mei" was sold at prices ranging from 254 to 280 yuan, and "Xi Xiu Mei" was sold at prices ranging from 53 to 4 yuan. Market prices are trending firm, it is said.</p>

<p>Recently, there has been little vitality in the soybean sales market. Although the amount of exports continues unabated, most of them are direct transshipments, and the original source is endless. Yesterday, Dalian Sipingjie soybeans (today, the quality of this soybean has some differences, and it is not as standardized as in the past), in the face of the sluggish sales situation, took the path of depreciation, so it was thrown down by 10 cents from the high price of 9 dollars and 65 cents to 9 dollars and 55 cents, causing the domestic sales of Xichang and other places to rise sharply, with a total of 11 or 12 trucks transacted. In addition, two trucks of Bengbu beans were properly sold at a price of 8 dollars and 82 cents. Small batches were sold locally: 260 bags of Pudong Du soybeans at a price of 9 dollars and 50 cents, 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans at a price of 8 dollars and 65 cents, and 50 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans at a price of 8 dollars and 65 cents.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's sugar market London telegram: August 8 shillings 2 pence 25, down 1 penny 75; December 6 shillings 2 pence; March of next year 6 shillings 3 pence, up 2 pennies and a half. Hong Kong telegram: the cost of raw white sugar brought to Shanghai is 11 Hong Kong dollars, down 4 cents. Therefore, the local guild priced, the spot 24 raw white sugar was slightly looser, the local godown price was 29 dollars and 80 cents, the outside godown price was 6 cents, and the transit bonded godown price was 21 dollars and 40 cents, all down 1 cent. However, spot Dutch red sugar rose sharply by 8 cents to 21 dollars and 60 cents, and the transit goods rose by 4 cents to 15 dollars and 40 cents. Tai Gu sugar rose and fell little, and the upper and lower grades maintained their original prices. At the same time, the spot red H mark also rose by half a dollar to 20 dollars and a half. The Chaozhou guild issued more than 80 bags of premium Diao Qing, priced at 17 dollars, and the Jianzhou guild opened up more than 100 bags of miscellaneous foreign sugar, priced at 20 dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e155">The Evolution of Woolen Fabric Brands in the Past Seventy Years <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhifeng</p>
<p>The woolen fabric industry in Shanghai began in the Tongzhi years, and it has been 70 years since then. Therefore, it is not only a pioneer in the whole of China, but also a hub for imports and exports. In these 70 years, the rise and fall of the woolen fabric market, the annual expansion of business, and the progress of domestic and foreign sales, and the innovation of patterns and colors will not be discussed for the time being (the reporter will have the opportunity to describe them one by one). What is discussed here is the past and present changes in the woolen fabric industry.</p>
<p>In the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China, the woolen fabric market was concentrated in the Broadway and Pengpu Road area of Hongkou, with more than 20 companies including Xinyi Gong, Renyi Gong, Hongji, Laoshengji, Quanji, Zhaoji, He Jinfeng, Guangsheng, Gongxing, Lianxing, Gongda, Xingtai, Jiatai, Yuantai, Henghe, Zhenda, Xinkang, Xiangyuan, Futai, Yongtai, Xianchang, Xieshengyu, Yuanfeng, Xinyi, and Xiangtaiyu, Ruitai Chang, etc. After the European War, it suffered a major blow from the shilling, and all but Xianchang suffered losses. (Because Wu Shandeng, the manager of Xianchang, had invested all his money at 89 shillings, he was able to make money. The others were all looking long, and less than one-third of them had purchased goods. Afterwards, the exchange rate plummeted, causing them to suffer heavy losses.) As a result, countless companies went bankrupt one after another. After the crisis passed, it returned to normal. New companies included Yichangtai, Fushun, Chen Fji, Yuandachang, Gonghe, Yongxinxiang, and Fuchang. The reorganized ones included Yuantai being reorganized into Yuanda. However, except for Quanji, Zhaoji, He Jinfeng, Henghe, Shunchangxiang, and Lianxingchang, the old ones have all closed down. At this time, there were only a dozen or so old and new companies in the Shanghai offshore goods gang, but the Dalu gang on Qipan Street in Shanghai suddenly flourished, and the market was divided into Shanghai offshore and Shanghai Dalu factions. The so-called Shanghai Dalu gang refers to more than 20 companies including Xinfeng, Meilun, Chunheyong, Taiheli, Hualun, Fuxin, Huaxin, Zhida, Yuantai, Xingchangxiang, Xiexing, Huikang, Jukang, Fukang, Yikang, Chengda, Huakang, Dalun, Yongfeng, Jiufeng, Shixin, Huachang, and Yuanhexian, etc. Those who opened in the Xinhe area (specializing in lower-grade, shoddy goods) include a few companies such as Yongyutai, Gurui Ji, Juxing, and Xingyu. It can be seen that the prosperity of the Dalu gang at that time and the number of shops had already exceeded the offshore goods gang, causing the center of the woolen fabric market to gradually shift to Shanghai, and the woolen fabric industry association also moved from Shangyang to Shanghai at this time.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Northern Expedition was unified, and the sales of woolen fabrics were very smooth. However, foreign exchange suddenly changed, followed by China's tariff autonomy and the revision of national tax rules. The woolen fabric industries of the Shangyang and Shanghai gangs underwent further changes. Larger Western clothing stores in the Nanjing Road area, such as Yuchangxiang, Wangxingchang, Rongchangxiang, and Wangshuntai, etc., all carried out offshore goods. Shunxing Dechang on Sichuan Road also produced samples, and Zhang Longtai, a tailor shop with Laohexing, all set up woolen fabric stores. New companies in the Shangyang offshore goods gang included Yifeng, Hanfeng, Jingtai, Taifeng, Ziyuan, Anshengchang, Fengyu, Tianfeng, and Yuji. New companies in the Shanghai Dalu gang included Shengchang, Xinchang, Yuanchang, Huafutai, Huasheng, Xiangxing, Yuchang, Qiafeng, Hengfeng, Hefeng, Meifeng, Fuchangxiang, and Wanchengyong. Afterwards, more than a dozen companies, including Dasheng, Yongxing, Yukang, Dekang, Yida, Hongxing, Huachengxiang, Tonghexian, Jiuhe, and Taifeng, Rendexiang, have also been opened, but all of them have closed down to this day. The woolen fabric guild has also moved from Nanjing Road to Qipan Street, because the woolen fabric market has been concentrated there. At this time, there were a total of 75 member shops, large and small, in the trade association, and the executive committee members were Xu Meiqing, Ge Jechen, Liu Dacai, Hong Fuyuan, Chen Meifang, Fei Rongfu, Zhou Qifeng, Wang Lianfang, Chen Keting, Wang Houfu, Chen Shunan, Zhang Jinguan, Ni Guocai, and Wang Shenghe. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e156">Piece Goods   Tianjin Merchants Launch Autumn Goods   Eastern Market Declines Due to High Cash Prices <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth Yesterday, the cash discount rate for the legal tender suddenly rose, and the opening price for Yihuo coarse cloth fell by 5 cents per piece. The prices for each cloth for transfer sales are still firm. The current deposit price for Qingfeng Factory twill last month was 5 cents and 5 li per yard for transfer, and this month it increased by 1.5 cents, and the line tweed also increased by 2 cents, opening at 5 cents and 45 cents. Sales are slightly more active in the north, and the Yantai merchants continued to handle 40 to 50 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, line tweed and coarse cloth. The Tianjin merchants originally ordered a huge amount, and the autumn season orders are also gradually being launched, and dozens of pieces of blue cloth, line tweed and other goods continue to be loaded. After the Yunnan merchants restored postal delivery once last month, they immediately stopped receiving them, and due to the difficult transportation during the extraordinary period, the goods were often stranded midway, and the turnover was not smooth. Moreover, the exchange rate has soared to 12 dollars 50 cents, making it more and more difficult to receive funds, so new transactions in Sichuan and Yunnan are extremely cold. Local retail transactions in this street are still frequent, and more than 1,000 pieces of poplin, twill, bleached cloth, foreign yarn and printed cloth were sold, and 40 to 50 pieces of white coarse cloth and fine twill were also handled. The Hong Kong merchants added 30 pieces of fine twill and Zhenzhong Guoqing and other brands.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth Yesterday, the fine cloth and fine twill market declined uniformly due to the continued increase in the cash discount. Each piece fell by about 10 cents. The current price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 14 dollars 10 cents to 15 cents, and Yanghe fine twill was priced at 13 dollars 90 cents per piece. Real sales were as rare as stars in the morning, and the market atmosphere was dull. The market "football" trading is also far from what it used to be, so the total daily transactions among peers are still only 200 to 300 pieces.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Woolen Fabric Orders Plunge <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still few woolen fabric spot transactions, and market prices remained high. However, transactions for foreign firm orders plummeted. No one from the offshore, mainland, or brand merchant groups inquired about prices. The orders that were about to be negotiated and those that had been finalized but had not yet been delivered were now mostly being rejected one after another. This is because most people in the industry still expect the current 6 pence and 5 exchange rate to fall further. The cost of woolen fabrics will inevitably increase sharply, and most are unwilling to take the risk of ordering. As a result, the business of general British, American, French, German, Polish, Czech, and Italian commercial firms in Shanghai has once again become deserted.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Medicinal Materials   Patchouli Shortage Causes Prices to Soar <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Patchouli, a Chinese medicine, can relieve exterior syndromes and dispel evil, enter the spleen and reach the lungs. Its fragrance can promote the middle, relax the diaphragm, awaken the stomach and refresh the mind. Its nature is slightly warm and can also ward off epidemics and stop vomiting. It is also very good at dispersing, so it is an essential medicine in the summer. Now is the peak season for sales. According to industry insiders, the stock of good quality goods on the ground is not high, and the supply from Hainan has been interrupted, which has caused people's hearts to be high. Recently, the selling price on the market has been rising day by day, and has risen by as much as 24 or 25 yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Seafood   Jian Mushrooms Rise Significantly <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Hong Kong merchants have been frequently purchasing shiitake mushrooms, and the market trend is still continuing. For example, the price of Jian mushrooms sold yesterday was 320 yuan, which was 45 yuan higher than the previous market. A few pieces of Jiangxi mushrooms were transacted. Because they were of lower quality, they were slightly moldy and priced at 318 dollars 60 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Qicai (Seaweed) Remains Firm <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Sales of Qicai are still active today. Sales continued yesterday, with Wudun vegetables priced at 21 yuan, Xilan vegetables at 24 yuan, Longya vegetables at 23 yuan, and Shimao vegetables at 28 yuan, each rising by 1 or 2 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Míngfǔ High-Quality Goods Are Scarce <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Recently, new Mingfu goods have been arriving one after another, so the stock here is still quite abundant. The current Ningbo ordinary grade is still sold at 28 yuan, the premium grade is 40 yuan, and the authentic Zhoushan goods are priced at 68 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan higher, and the supply is extremely short, and there is a trend of demand exceeding supply.</p>
<h3 id="e162">North-South Goods   Cold Storage Lychee Rises Sharply <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Since Jinshan branches were stored in cold storage, the cost has been rising daily, and the supply is also scarce. Therefore, the trend is becoming tighter. The cold storage yuan branches in yesterday's market have been shouted out at 70 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan higher than before. Cold storage glutinous rice branches are particularly firm and expensive, and must be sold at 150 yuan, with an increase of nearly 20 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Longan Recovers by One Yuan <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Longan was once suspended due to the high premium on cash, but recently, as the premium has eased, and the brand holders have opened slightly to avoid roasting and storing for too long. It was found that the previous market had fallen by 2 yuan and has now recovered by 1 yuan, with 700 to 800 pieces transacted. The rest may need to be opened again, and most of them will be stored in roasting godowns to wait for the post-market transshipment and then be opened for cashing in, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Xuzhou Vegetables Will Soon Be New <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Since the fall of Shantou, the sales area for daylily has become narrower, so although the premium is high, there is no sharp increase. Yesterday, dozens of bags of ordinary goods were opened, priced at 20 yuan. High-quality goods are still scarce and difficult to loosen, and must be 31 to 2 yuan. Lower grades are only about 17 yuan. It is heard that this year's new goods have not been able to appear on the market in time due to frequent traffic obstacles, but a small number of Xuzhou goods may arrive. It is estimated that the goods will be available by the middle of this month, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Coal   Borneo Coal Remains Expensive <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The bituminous coal business is plain and weak, and the market transacts less than 500 tons per day. However, due to cost concerns, the owners are holding on, and the market is still firm as usual. Yesterday, Borneo coal was sold by the brand, and a small number opened, with lump coal priced at 47 yuan per ton and screened lumps at 51 yuan. From the peer's godown, it is necessary to add other miscellaneous expenses to deliver to the customer's home.</p>

<p>Hongji small zi coal had a shortage of spot goods, and the opening price has been repeatedly raised, and the highest price has reached 56 yuan per ton, and there is no supply of goods. The Dehui Foreign Firm recently had a slight arrival of goods, but it was only 150 to 60 tons, which was not enough for distribution, so the price is still difficult to fall. Delivery is subject to additional charges, plus the consumption of screened crumbs, and the retail price is 7 dollars 25 cents per basket, which is still in the nature of a "service".</p>
<p>The "Winkfild" wheel, managed by Yihuo Foreign Firm on the 4th, arrived at Wusongkou from Calcutta with 7,058 tons of coal. Since there were no docks or pontoons to berth in the Huangpu River, it anchored outside the harbor to wait. It is now learned that pontoons 34 and 35 are empty, and the company ordered the ship to enter the harbor at 6:00 a.m. yesterday and anchor at pontoons 34 and 35 for transshipment. In addition, the "Baron Inckhape", also managed by the company, is also transporting 9,100 tons of coal from Calcutta, and the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai on Saturday (8th) of this week.

<p>The pig iron sales market has merchants and external customers in this street but since recently, the price has been high, so business in this street is unusually quiet, and external merchant gangs (such as Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Yantai, Ningbo, Fujian, Anhui, and the Yangtze River Road, etc.) have almost no goods exported due to environmental and shipping schedules, etc. Market prices have soared due to the increase in various goods in this city. For example, the market price of No. 1 Indian pig iron is 265 yuan per ton, No. 2 is 255 yuan, No. 1 Russian pig iron is estimated at 255 yuan per ton, and the No. 1 Yangtze River Li River product is priced at 255 yuan per ton. The price of No. 2 goods is 245 yuan, all of which are more than 20 yuan higher than the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Black Iron Sheet Prices Increase, Real Sales Are Depressed <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Although the market for black iron sheets was once lively, it was caused by factories and customers competing to purchase them, but since recently, the prices of the goods have increased, and the sales from various places have been stagnant. For example, the hot water bottle factories in Shanghai have little activity. In addition, customers from Tianjin, Qingdao, etc. also purchased very little. Therefore, the lively market is no longer what it used to be. However, the market price is 4 to 5 yuan higher than before. For example, the price of 3 to 10 sheets is 28 yuan per load, the special price of 11 sheets is 29 yuan, the price of 12 sheets is 30 yuan, and the price of 13 sheets is 32 yuan (the above are all 3 feet and 6 feet). The price of 18 sheets is 27 yuan and 50 cents, and the 2-foot and 6-foot goods, it is estimated that only 30 to 40 loads were transacted yesterday.</p>

<p>— Wisdom</p>
<p>When leaving home at night, do not turn off all the lights. It is best to leave one or two lights on, because thieves are less likely to enter a room with lights on.</p>
<p>Do not put your keys under the mat, on the door, or in the mailbox.</p>
<p>Do not put money or valuables under the carpet, or hang them behind the mirror, in pottery, or under the mat. Because these are the first places thieves search or pay attention to after entering the house.</p>
<p>Do not put a chain lock on the outside of the door, because this is like telling people that you are not at home.</p>
<p>If you lose your keys, do not forget to get a new lock.</p>
<p>If you find a thief in the house, do not turn on the lights, just quietly call the police station.</p>
<p>Do not let those who call themselves goods salesmen, meter readers, or runners into your house without showing a certificate. If in doubt, call their employer before letting them in or talking to them in the corridor.</p>
<p>Do not buy cheap things from strangers, because these things are counterfeit or stolen. It is best to call the police immediately. If these things are really valuable, they will definitely keep them for themselves, or sell them to their friends.</p>
<p>Do not neglect to inquire about the guarantors of your servants, and do not just ask the seat head on the phone. It is best to ask in person.</p>
<p>Do not believe that someone is a good person because they are neatly dressed, and do not flaunt your own wealth. Modern bad people will never tell you that they are bad people.</p>
<p>Do not put your purse on the counter when buying things in the store. This is a good opportunity that thieves are constantly looking for.</p>
<p>Do not doze off on the tram or bus. This gives pickpockets a good opportunity to steal your valuables.</p>
<p>If someone asks you the time, do not take out your watch to look, this often gives thieves a good opportunity to steal your watch.</p>
<p>In public places, do not let anyone cover your face with a newspaper; this person wants your watch or other valuables; they are obscuring your vision to facilitate their accomplices' theft.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Rain Hat <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>For days on end, the plum rains fall, making it truly inconvenient to go out. Carrying an umbrella and wearing overshoes is such a burden, especially when wearing a Western suit. What kind of hat is suitable to wear that can both keep out the rain and remain undamaged? Let's discuss it here:</p>
<p>Some people use old woolen hats as rain hats, which is indeed economical. However, hats made of inferior materials can only withstand light rain. During the plum rain season, the raindrops will penetrate them without hindrance. Moreover, woolen hats are already out of season. It is best to wear straw hats. Recently, there is a kind of madder-dyed straw hat on the market. The styles are very fashionable, ranging from ten and a half yuan to fifty or sixty yuan. You can run in the rain with them, and the rain will definitely not seep into the roots of your hair. When you return home, wipe it with a cloth, and it will look as good as new. It will not damage the original hat material at all. On the contrary, it will wash away the dust that has accumulated on it in sunny weather. Therefore, this kind of hat does not need to be taken to a laundry and dyeing shop for cleaning. However, the price is too expensive, and ordinary people cannot afford it, so they have to think of other ways.</p>
<p>If you only have a woolen hat, you can also wear it on rainy days. Don't worry about the rain stains on the hat not being removable, even if it is a white woolen hat. We have a method: after the weather clears, wash the woolen hat worn on rainy days with a dry cleaning solvent, hang it up to dry in the sun, making it evenly dry and clean. Then buy a bottle of hydrogen peroxide (available in pharmacies) and spray it two or three times. Each time you spray, you must wait for it to dry completely before spraying the second time, until the rain stains are completely removed. If the stain is removed after one application, of course, there is no need to spray a second time.</p>
<p>Indeed, rainy days are most difficult for those who wear Western suits. To ensure that the hat worn does not lose its elegance and nobility, you can only use the above method. If you want to avoid trouble, you should have a top hat that can be used in both sunny and rainy weather!</p>
<h3 id="e171">A Few Matters Concerning Living <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Hu</p>
<p>Soldiers live in barracks, and refugees live in grass shacks. It doesn't matter to them, even if it does, they don't have money, so it's still the same as it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, and mosquitoes and bedbugs are rampant again, impossible to kill all and impossible to catch them all. It is truly a sweating matter. But as long as you are from a middle-class family or above, you have the ability to buy medicine to exterminate them. Mosquito repellent incense, mosquito coils, bedbug powder... there are plenty on the market.</p>
<p>But how are these things actually formulated? This is probably what people who want to know the reason are eager to know!</p>
<p>First, let's talk about mosquito repellent. The most common mosquito repellents are mosquito repellent perfume, mosquito coils, mosquito repellent powder, and mosquito repellent sticks. Now, let's write down their ingredients and preparation methods one by one:</p>
<p>The ingredients of mosquito repellent perfume are 100 grams of cedar oil, 100 grams of lemongrass oil, 100 grams of eucalyptus oil, 100 grams of camphor oil, 100 grams of clove oil, and then add 90% (purity) alcohol to make a total of 1 kilogram, mix well, and filter with talc powder. When using, apply to the face, neck, and legs. Mosquitoes will smell the fragrance and avoid it.</p>
<p>The ingredients of mosquito coils are 10 grams of benzoin powder, 10 grams of cassia bark powder, 100 grams of pyrethrum powder, and a small amount of tragacanth gum. Mix appropriately and make it into a spiral, linear, or stick shape. Dry it in the sun. If making spiral incense, you can add an appropriate amount of verdigris to make it green. This product is more expensive to make, but it is very effective. Most commercially available products contain sawdust and cypress incense.</p>
<p>The ingredients of mosquito repellent powder are 5 grams of eucalyptus oil phenol, 25 grams of tea powder, 35 grams of talc powder, and 35 grams of starch. First, grind the tea into fine powder, then add the powders, and finally add the eucalyptus oil phenol. When using, apply to various parts of the skin.</p>
<p>The ingredients of mosquito repellent sticks are 5 grams of star anise oil, 5 grams of anise oil, 25 grams of cocoa butter, 25 grams of tea powder, and 10 grams of beeswax. Melt them at low temperature, use glass or metal tubes as molds, and wrap them in tin foil or pack them in mint lozenge wooden boxes.</p>
<p>As for bedbug repellent liquid and bedbug powder, bedbug repellent liquid is divided into three types: A, B, and C. The ingredients of type A are 5 grams of carbolic acid, 50 grams of ether, and 150 grams of petroleum ether. The ingredients of type B are 100 grams of kerosene and 100 grams of turpentine. The ingredients of type C are 100 grams of tobacco leaves, an appropriate amount of lemon balm oil, and 1 kilogram of petroleum ether. The method of making type C: soak the tobacco leaves in petroleum ether, filter after five days; dissolve the other ingredients in the filtrate.</p>
<p>The ingredients of bedbug powder are 100 grams of pyrethrum powder, 8 grams of carbolic acid, and 6 grams of citric acid. Mix and shake well.</p>
<p>In addition, rats are also one of the dregs, so rat poison will also be described here.</p>
<p>Ordinary rat poison is also divided into three types: A, B, and C. The ingredients of type A are 100 grams of gypsum, 100 grams of wheat flour, and 5 drops of anise oil. The ingredients of type B are 4 grams of arsenic acid, 38 grams of lard, 58 grams of wheat flour, and 0.5 grams of anise oil. The ingredients of type C are 30 grams of barium carbonate, 8 grams of barley flour, 15 grams of glycerin, and 60 grams of cheese.</p>

<p>— Zhong Maochang</p>
<p>Amidst this chorus of rising prices, life on this isolated island becomes increasingly difficult. We must begin by tightening our belts. It is often said that clothing is the most challenging, but one can strive to economize on both clothing and travel. One can seek simple cloth garments, and forgo transportation, relying on one's own feet to reach far and wide. However, I have long suffered from rheumatism and bone pain. During the plum rain season, my legs invariably feel numb and insensitive, with aching pains occurring frequently, making it difficult to move. I was once treated by Doctor Li in my hometown and recovered without incident. Now, having come to Shanghai to work, I am constantly on the move, running around every day. Recently, the old ailment has relapsed, making it inconvenient to walk. Reluctantly, I resort to public buses and trams, which I usually avoid, but fares have also increased, costing me a great deal each day. Later, my knees became swollen and painful, preventing me from going out. Confined to my small room, I felt doubly miserable. I consulted a surgeon, who said that I was developing gonitis. I took medicine for several days without improvement, and it even worsened. A neighbor told me that Changnian Chinese Pharmacy in Tongfu Village, Tongfu Road, sells Huangshan Health Bone Grass, which can treat severe rheumatism. I asked someone to buy two boxes and take them. The swelling and pain subsided slightly. I continued to take two dozen, and then I regained my freedom, the illness as if lost. Today, I am still out and about, my gait as normal as before. The name "Health Bone" is truly not in vain. I recall years ago when I traveled with friends to Huangshan, exploring the famous mountains and scenic spots, with their many ancient pines, old trees, rare flowers, and exotic grasses. I often did not recognize their names, nor did I pay much attention to them. I never imagined that there would be a miraculous herb that could cure my foot ailment. I must record this and tell others who suffer from the same condition.</p>

<p>Potatoes, commonly known as foreign yams, are also one of the vegetables richest in vitamins. Moreover, the price is relatively low. In my economical menu, they should occupy an important position. There are many ways to cook them, and they go well with both meat and vegetables. If compared to people, they are like a friendly and sociable friend. When making coffee, potatoes are indispensable. And braised pork, lamb, etc., may as well have them added. As for vegetarian dishes, then braised vegetarian ten-scenery also needs to use them, as with cabbage being the main ingredients. Recently, my family often eats two dishes, one meat and one vegetarian, both using potatoes, and I will introduce them to the readers to try. The meat dish is mashed potato beef patties. Peel the potatoes, cook them until they are tender, add a little bread crumbs and water chestnut powder, fry them in oil until golden brown, then cut the beef into small pieces and make them into patties with onions, stir-fry them in a pot, and add some water chestnut powder inside, so the beef will not feel old and tough. When eating, mix the potato patties and beef patties together, which is very delicious. If you don’t eat beef, you can use pork. The vegetarian dish is to peel the potatoes, cook them until tender, mash them, add chopped scallions or finely chopped pickled vegetables, and fry them together, which can also be eaten with rice.</p>

<h3 id="e175">The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of Overseas Chinese <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Old Friends of Chaoyang</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Chinese people, overseas Chinese can be divided into three periods over the centuries. During the Qing Dynasty's isolation policy, the West, America, and Southeast Asia were all considered uncivilized lands. The government regarded overseas Chinese as mere weeds, and the overseas Chinese viewed the government as bandits. During the flourishing period of the Republic of China, they were eager for internal warfare. Those who had a smattering of foreign languages became ministers, regarded by the people at home as emperors and gods. The government regarded overseas Chinese as dogs and horses, and the overseas Chinese viewed the government as strangers. In recent years, with the increasing foreign threats, the thoughts and spirits of the entire nation, from top to bottom, have shifted from scattered to unified. Remittances from overseas Chinese to the country have become a vast source to supplement and balance the country's revenue and expenditure. The official reliance on overseas Chinese is roughly like that of limbs, and the maintenance of the government by overseas Chinese is mostly like that of the heart. Therefore, when a few resident envoys, who usually wield power and influence, encounter a situation where their ability is insufficient and a flaw occurs in their inability to protect overseas Chinese, they try to shirk responsibility, which is also a waste of breath. The invulnerability of the overseas Chinese is becoming increasingly clear. Therefore, I will focus on the four necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation to clarify the reality of the improved living conditions of those who have gone abroad to earn a living for the country.</p>
<p>First, Clothing: Except for sailors from Fujian and Guangdong, who serve on Western merchant ships and are assigned to tasks such as stoking fires and washing clothes, where short blue and white shirts and pants are most suitable. Those who live in cities, whether in Europe or America, all wear Western suits, and our overseas Chinese cannot be an exception. The degree of superiority or inferiority of their living standards can be judged by the quality of their hats and the difference in the quality of their overcoats and short jackets. Secondly, all overseas Chinese are fond of wearing the Republic of China's blue sky, white sun, and cloisonné silver badge to distinguish themselves from other Eastern ethnic groups from various countries. In recent years, among the Zhejiang Chinese from Wenzhou, Qingtian, and other places who reside in various countries in Western Europe, there is a small portion who make a living by making and selling ties.</p>
<p>Second, Transportation: The new era replaces walking with vehicles, which is deeply in line with the proverb that every inch of time is worth an inch of gold. What is even faster than vehicles is airplanes. Although there is no previous record of wealthy overseas Chinese owning their own airplanes, in Western America and Southeast Asia, where the history of overseas Chinese is the longest, it is not uncommon for them to have one to dozens of cars. Secondly, such as in the flat and vast Netherlands in Western Europe without high mountains, the Zhejiang Chinese from Wenzhou seen there, from Hantang Amster-dam in the north to Junwanglin Hertogen-bosch in the south, all competing to ride bicycles to fly on different paths for the weaving and mending utensils and so on. Next, the thing that best demonstrates the greatness of our Chinese people's ability to make a living is the long-distance walking tour that crosses the two continents of Asia and Europe. The people of Tianmen, Hubei, with their paper flowers, the people of Yantai, Shandong, with their silk materials, the people of Qingtian, Zhejiang, with their mosaic work, in recent times have penetrated deep into Russia, and the reachers have reached Paris. The vastness of the journey, perhaps thousands of miles or tens of thousands of miles, if people get good things and evolve them into notes and broadcast them on the silver screen, it will definitely greatly increase the perseverance of countless rising youths who hear about the inland and the border. Ms. Huang Yiguang, who married from Guangzhou and made a walking trip to the world, also took the universe as a school and nature as a textbook, placing herself among the pioneers of advanced countries, and should be ashamed of nothing.</p>
<p>Third, Housing: The characteristic enjoyment of Chinese people in Europe and America, and the thing they feel most different in their standard of living, is "housing". British and Americans love quiet and hate noise, which has become a habit. The places where overseas Chinese first had contact with overseas were mostly in Britain and America, and the most difficult habit to overcome was "housing". In Western cities, cats are silent all day long, and the Holy Child closes its heavy doors and does not hear crying. A very small number of wealthy Chinese children residing in Morningsite Heights in New York were forced to move because a certain child's crying one night caused all the residents to be forced to move elsewhere. To this day, there are special districts in various cities in North America, such as Chinatown, and one of the biggest reasons is the restriction of habits. It can be asserted. Today, times are different and labor is different. Since the Chinese people's resistance against Japan, they have been highly regarded in European and American society. Ms. Yang Huimin's talk about her personal experience in traveling to the United States has further broken the sycophantic view of those who worship foreigners and despise the Chinese. Even at the Golden Gate International Exposition in 1939, it was known to promote Chinatown to stand out from the world. As Mr. Dai Jitao said, the word "China" will one day be transformed into a good name because of the efforts of the Chinese people. Another reason why Chinese people's housing and Western people's affairs are so different is frugality. The Confucian masses work hard every day and night, their minds are keen on saving the country, and they serve themselves very modestly. During the national crisis, it is very appropriate, even if the purchase coupons are still abolished by a certain ambassador to the Republic of China, the opposite is true. Therefore, although the life of citizens in various landlocked countries in Europe is not as low and strict as that of British and Americans, Gharlotten-hmrg in Berlin, the Ding district in Paris, and Katen-dreeht in Rotterdam have also been as convenient as New York's Lower Town to accommodate Chinese people.</p>
<p>Fourth, Food: What our China is most proud of in the world is the beauty and abundance of its dishes, and Cantonese chefs are especially unique in their skills. Looking at the restaurants in various European and American countries, only Erchusi in Paris, who has the oldest qualifications, is from Nanjing, and the rest are almost all from Bin'an, Guangdong. There are seven of them in the Netherlands. The oldest is the China Building organized by Yuan Hua (located at 18 Delistraat, Rotterdam). The second is Guangxing Building founded by Wu Fu (Intangible Han Dandan). The next is Zhongshan Building managed by Deng Sheng (Rotterdam). The next is the Far East Hotel of Zhang Guoshu (next to the Peace Palace in The Hague). The next is the Zaidong Building of Wu Zijun (72 Grindstone Street, Hantang). The next is the Nanyang Building of Chou Zu (50 Thomsonlaan, The Hague). And the smallest is Feng Sheng's good restaurant (21 Guanye Street, Leiden). All seven are owned by Bin'an people.</p>
<p>Others such as the Chinese Restaurant on the Tian'anmen Straight Street leading to Saint-Germain Avenue BD.St.Germain in Paris, the Wanhualou and Tanhualou in Paris and London, which have become brother companies, the Shanghai Building in San Francisco, the Nanjing Building in Washington, and the Divine Continent Building in Philadelphia, are all due to the Cantonese overseas Chinese setting up restaurants that make the scholars and merchants who travel overseas feel the joy of being at home. As for the food of sailors, it is even more difficult among the Qinglian, which seems to be not easy for those pedestrians to know. Mr. Zhou Yijie, who was elected as the vice chairman of the National Diplomacy Committee during the Pacific Conference, once said in his experience: "Working hard on the ship, although the scenery and waves do not allow sleep, the sea must eat if there is no strength, and although it is vomiting, it should continue to eat. In this way, it can gradually become a habit from reluctantly. The food method to avoid dizziness and vomiting is to avoid tea and water. Those who work on the ship every know to persuade people to chew more pot-scorched rice, and the mouth contains codonopsis." Mr. Zhou's statement also helps the self-reliant students who go abroad, and can be combined with the new medicine prepared for passengers on the new era airplane to prevent vomiting, which can be combined with each other.</p>

<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>As soon as you mention benevolence, you have to bring in righteousness, or even morality by association. But everyone knows about benevolence, righteousness, and morality, and the two old masters, Confucius and Mencius, have said so much and lectured so much, it seems that there is no need to add another word. However, in this civilized age, there are many things that did not exist in the past, and the scope of benevolence has also increased a lot, so it is necessary to broaden this benevolence a bit to show it to future generations.</p>
<p>For example, benevolence is compassion, and compassion is charity. In today's charitable undertakings, it is better to send him to the Western Paradise as soon as possible, which is more appropriate. There are also items such as deducting relief funds or selling relief grain, which is because those who manage this undertaking feel that relieving themselves is more urgent than relieving the refugees, and without relieving themselves, it is difficult to relieve the refugees. Their actions are still with compassion. Similarly, in order to run charitable undertakings, it is necessary to add a few cars, and the food, clothing, and housing must be more particular, all of which are reasonable, because without doing so, their precious work will be more time-consuming, and the precious bodies that are related to the safety of so many people will be unwell. As for the poor and beggars wandering on the streets, there is no need to provide relief to encourage their self-reliance. Once they die of cold and hunger, then provide them with coffins and burial, which is even more immeasurable merit, because abandoning corpses in the open is something that the benevolent cannot bear. And cleaning them up, so as to avoid decay, epidemic, and harm to oneself, is it not a benevolent and righteous act?</p>
<p>I have also heard of a type of philanthropist whose actions are truly inconceivable. He has money, so he goes to collect many poor girls, living in the courtyard he designates, never allowed to leave the garden gate for the rest of their lives, serving as his unnamed but de facto concubines, so that they can eat endlessly for the rest of their lives. Of course, everyone praises him, because if he did not do this, these poor girls might have filled the gullies long ago. So now some smaller philanthropists go to adopt a few poor children, boys or girls, teaching them to sing operas, teaching them to dance, etc., with "a skill," earning money for him, supporting him and supporting themselves, so we can only praise him.</p>
<p>However, the benevolence of charitable undertakings is still social and personal, and ultimately not as great as the benevolence of the state. The benevolence of the state is the so-called benevolent government. We already know a little about what large-scale charitable undertakings are, so we cannot but know what large-scale benevolent government is, which is also called broadening.</p>
<p>Originally, the benevolent government passed down from ancient sages was to provide relief to widowers, widows, orphans, and the lonely, so that there would be "no resentful women within, and no unmarried men without." Now, indeed, some people do this; however, their manpower and methods must first create many widowers, widows, orphans, lonely people, resentful women, and unmarried men as preparation for relief. They say that without doing so, benevolent government cannot be implemented.</p>
<p>In addition, it is said that there is another kind of benevolent government that provides relief to anyone. For example, if you have been bullied and want to take revenge, he will come to advise you not to take revenge, saying, once you take revenge, since the outcome is not yet determined, there is danger to be taken. If you fail, you will not survive. If you win, you will inevitably make others unable to step down, and it will lead to mutual destruction. It is better to bow your head and seek peace with those who bully us, which is more sure, enough to shrink your head without danger, and preserve your life. … They have the legacy of "the king going to Bin," and the benevolence is spread far beyond "King Wen's governing with benevolence." I think the people of the world and future generations will definitely write a special book for them in history and sing their praises again and again!</p>
<p>However, such benevolent government is only advocated by people, and whether it will work is still unknown. If they really get it to work, maybe everyone will truly ascend to "the other shore"! Alas, benevolent government!</p>
<p>I remember a famous monk who made a gatha when he ate eggs. The last two sentences are: "The old monk will take you to the Western Paradise, to avoid eating a knife in the world." This monk is indeed a benevolent gentleman. The benevolence I want to broaden is mostly equivalent to this monk's eating eggs. Smart people can infer from this, and I will not "give another example."</p>

<p>—Memories of Breaking Through from Xuzhou</p>
<p>In the misty dawn, the procession resembled a long serpent, winding along the ridges of the fields. As far as the eye could see, the boundless fields were filled with ripening wheat, parched and dry. The grains, each and every one, were so plump and lovely, yet left to waste in the fields, exposed to the wind, slowly decaying!</p>
<p>As the night receded, the villages, scattered across this vast land like exquisite little parks, appeared in their pleasing green attire, clear and distinct. These villages all shared the same layout: they were encircled by a defensive ditch, along which were planted jujube and mulberry trees. The thatched cottages, made of sorghum stalks, were half-hidden within the groves. The villages lacked the pungent odor of cow dung found in southern villages, and entering them felt like stepping into a small park, evoking a lingering reluctance to depart.</p>
<p>After passing Zhu Village, the sky suddenly grew somber, a fierce wind whipped up, followed by rain.</p>
<p>The procession continued its advance. The rain, pelting the sun-scorched heads, brought a comforting coolness. However, it quickly soaked everyone, raindrops coursing down faces like streams and dripping onto the drenched clothing…</p>
<p>"The commander's order: Pass it on—run!"</p>
<p>"The commander's order: Pass it on—run!"</p>
<p>The command echoed, fading into the distance, and the procession quickened its pace.</p>
<p>The road, barely wide enough for two to run abreast, was riddled with puddles of muddy water. Stepping onto this muddy path, individuals stumbled one after another, yet immediately picked themselves up, desperately pushing forward towards our destination. Was this not a symbol of our current resistance: though beset by setbacks, so long as we press on, victory will be ours?</p>
<p>Sometime in the afternoon, we arrived at Li Xin Settlement, a substantial earthen town. Though the populace had not entirely fled, they remained huddled within their homes, doors firmly shut…</p>
<p>They seemed to harbor some misunderstanding of us. We immediately found someone to roam the streets, sounding a gong:</p>
<p>"This is our army! Quickly open your shops! Fair trade, no price gouging allowed!"</p>
<p>After the gong sounded, the firmly shut shop doors did indeed open. Before each shop, a throng of people in drenched clothing gathered, creating a bustle of business that had never been seen before. The shopkeepers, happily bustling about, seemed to be smiling inwardly: "These, indeed, are our army!..."</p>
<p>The rain grew heavier and heavier. Late that night, an allied force, braving the torrential downpour, surged into the town. Hearing the clamorous footsteps, one could not help but think: Good, we continue fighting, we are not alone!</p>
<h3 id="e179">My Dream <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>People often harbor many dreams, because human emotions blindly pull people's hearts to fly in all directions, just as walking without a fixed route, unable to recognize the direction, and unable to find an end. Those fleeting, wonderful, and strange dreams create in people an unstable mood like a paper kite floating, and a chaotic feeling like the shadows of slender willow branches being blown in the breeze.</p>
<p>Here, you get no stimulation, nor do you feel tired, it really feels like you are in a "dream"; here, you get no moment of stability, not a moment that makes you truly, silently "think." Everything is so empty and ethereal. This dream is not a spiritual bud that can blossom and then bear fruit, but merely a wave floating in the ocean of thoughts. It washes away humanity's ambition to create itself, and sweeps away the lifeline that people tightly grasp!</p>
<p>I also have my own dreams; it is not like the rainbow that appears occasionally in the sky after the rain, which is only simple beauty; it is not like the sound of thunder that disappears in an instant, which only vibrates the eardrum; nor is it truly dreamlike, without edges to be found. It is the crystallization of my thoughts, the only flower in my heart, and it will gradually bloom. But this is not its end; merely blooming is not precious, its end is a plump fruit that does not decorate the surface!</p>
<p>Those empty dreams cannot occupy my heart, I am concerned about a dream that must be truly realized, because I know what I am living for. I do not want to wander like a cloud towards the realm of reflections of the moon in water and flowers in a mirror, letting time turn my beard and hair gray, and then lament my fate like a withered flower. I do not want to see the vague, wonderful underside of life as if through a纱 screen, I do not want to use my eyes to dominate my happiness, because I deeply understand that such happiness will become yesterday's flower!</p>
<p>I want to see all the ugliness and hypocrisy in the world; I want to see the sneers, the weeping, the angry glares, the long faces, and the large drops of sweat turning into money!</p>
<p>But, what should I do? I want to use my "truth" to drive away mankind's "falsehood," and use my "goodness" to melt their "evil," to replace the bitterness on their faces with smiles they have never had!</p>
<h3 id="e180">Starting from "Anti" <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Sheng</p>
<p>Currently, the "anti" movement is unfolding vigorously in the literary world. Sometimes "anti" is deemed insufficient, and with righteous indignation, labeling things as "shallow," "not understanding anything," "not knowing what something is for," after quoting a large amount of evidence, it ends with "look in the mirror, know yourself." I think this attitude fails to understand the effect of "anti," and on the contrary, gives readers a bad impression of itself.</p>
<p>Examining the object of this "anti" movement, it is "individualism" and "mechanists." Tracing back to the source, it still boils down to the entanglement between "stereotyped writing" and "art." However, my humble opinion is that "stereotyped writing" is needed, and "art" is even more needed; but one cannot transcend the times, and everything must have a close relationship with the "War of Resistance."</p>
<p>Argument is also necessary, but the first goal should not deviate from the times. "Stereotyped writing" that belongs to the "War of Resistance" is still needed after all. Of course, "art" that is related to the "War of Resistance" is even more needed. But it cannot be asserted that "stereotyped writing of the War of Resistance" is all "shallow theoretical articles."</p>
<p>Let's look back, to what stage has the so-called "art" been "deepened" and "elevated"? The atmosphere of "pure literature" is indeed very rampant, and it is still growing vigorously. But from several "pure literature" publications, can we smell the bloody scent of reality? If one is not careful, one will be involved in "stereotyped writing" again, which is extremely "inappropriate"? However, this demand is very common, and most young people will shout: "We want bloody things." This is not surprising, because young people growing up in such an era seem unable to protect anything that transcends the times.</p>
<p>It is said that the reason why "pure literature" publications are so flourishing is not so simple--for the art of art--originally, who is also in doubt, things that adapt to the needs of readers, but still time economic panic, forced to suspend publication; This kind of beauty (?) that specializes in technique, ignores the reality, can it continue to support it? The question is here. The impact of the empty and skillful beauty on readers is: to dilute the awareness of the War of Resistance! This is something no one can deny, right? Therefore, I have great doubts about this kind of so-called "pure literature," that is, I must make a judgment immediately.</p>
<p>"Anti" should be directed against individualists, and even more should be directed against those who talk about art without regard to reality. This is not a mechanical conclusion, because the creation of individualists and those who cling to transcendental art theory is by no means accidental. Since it is not accidental, you should not think of "persuading," let alone "winning over."</p>
<p>It is also a fact that a small number of writers have returned from the united front to the realm of individualism, which is by no means a matter of "cause and effect, no evidence." Since we understand what kind of impact this will have on the current stage of the War of Resistance, we must not only passively "disrespect" it, but also actively "anti" it!</p>
<h3 id="e181">Dawn <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Shuguang</p>
<p>Dawn shines on the eastern sky,</p>
<p>An instant between darkness and sunlight.</p>
<p>Like a turbulent stream,</p>
<p>The stubborn rocks have time to be crushed,</p>
<p>But the stream never dies.</p>
<p>Like a galloping dragon,</p>
<p>Rushing through towering peaks,</p>
<p>Crossing deep ravines.</p>
<p>In that distant north,</p>
<p>Today, the first flame of light is lit.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Red Devil Vasika <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Gorky, translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>"Break the glass? Hey, I'll make you eat the broken glass!" Vasika said.</p>
<p>As soon as this stubborn woman heard this, she had to hurry to Vasika's side. If the woman wanted to delay, he would walk up to her himself, twist her hair, and throw her to the floor. And her sisters, - even those who were very close to her, had to tie her feet and block her mouth, and in front of them, on the floor of that kitchen, they whipped this guilty person. If he encountered a bold woman who liked to complain to people, then in order not to open her skin, he would use a wide leather whip, separated by a thick cotton swab soaked in water, to whip her, so that she would not leave blue marks on her body. In addition, he also used a long cloth bag full of sand and gravel, - using such a cloth bag to hit her buttocks, so that she felt a dull pain, which would crawl on the flesh and not subside for a long time,…………</p>
<p>But whether the punishment was severe or not depended on the woman's crime and Vasika's sympathy, regardless of the character of the prisoner. Sometimes, even bold women, he whipped mercilessly. His pants pocket always contained three leather whips with tails inlaid with oak handles that shone from frequent use. The leather whip was skillfully inlaid with many iron wires, and the tips of the whip laces twisted the tails of the iron wires into a circle. The first blow would tear the skin and flesh, hitting straight into the bone. And in order to increase their pain, he often smeared mustard on the broken backs, or covered the wound with a cloth soaked in thick salt water.</p>
<p>He punished the girls without any anxiety, always with a lonely and serious face, and calm movements. His eyes always showed an insatiable, greedy expression. In just an instant, he inexplicably became even darker.</p>
<p>The tricks of punishment were not limited to this point. No, Vasika had infinite such tricks. His cultivation in punishing prostitutes had reached the same level as nature.</p>
<p>There was such an incident. In a brothel, a woman named Vina Kabutva was suspected of stealing five thousand rubles from a client. The client was a merchant from New Bicossi, and he stated at the police station: "I was with her and her companion Sarah Miluman in Vina's room. Sarah left after sitting for an hour or two. I only spent one night with Vina, and later I got drunk and left her place."</p>
<p>The case went to court, and after a long time, the two defendants were questioned in preliminary hearings, but because the evidence was insufficient, they were acquitted.</p>
<p>When the trial ended and they returned to detention, both of them were privately interrogated again. The madam believed that they had stolen the money, and she wanted to get a share of the loot herself.</p>
<p>Sarah proved that she had nothing to do with this theft. The old madam desperately targeted Vina Kabutva. She locked Vina in the bathroom and allowed her to eat salted eel. But no matter what other methods were used, Vina would not say where the money was hidden. Therefore, she had to resort to Vasika's skills.</p>
<p>The madam made an agreement with them that if he could force Vina to say where the money was, he would give him a ruble.</p>
<p>So one night, in the bathroom where Vina, plagued by hunger, terror, and danger, was sitting, this devil appeared.</p>
<p>He was wearing a black fur coat, the fur exuded the smell of yellow phosphorus, and the smoke of blue light. His eyes shone like fire as he stood before her. He asked her in a terrible voice: (2)</p>

<h3 id="e183">Listening to Yan Jupeng's Two Operas (Part 1) — Most Supportive of Two Words <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng was hired by the Golden Theatre this time, calling himself the Old Tan School. The first day he performed "The Empty City Stratagem", and the box office was almost unprecedented. The opera fans' welcome to Yan can be seen. As a fellow fan, I ought to go listen, and on the third day, I also went to see "Hongyang Cave" in the afternoon. After listening and returning, I couldn't sleep at night. I thought and analyzed it, and wanted to write it down to tell the fellow fans. The twists and turns are very long to say. I don't have time to say long words now. I had no choice but to find a word in each play. Although there are only two words, the relationship is very big, that is, the "thief" in the running water board of "The Empty City Stratagem", and the "idle" in the entrance yuan board of "Hongyang Cave".</p>
<p>When the first act of "The Empty City Stratagem" ends, he sings "The late emperor... also spared me from personally capturing the thief," the "thief" character, the entering tone returns to the Yang Ping tone. If according to the example of the Hubei and Guangdong accent low pronunciation, singing this word will not be bad. Its badness lies in making the cavity not round, and the previous word, the cavity of the character "ba", yin and yang (this yin and yang refers to the aspect of the cavity tone) will not, the disease is called "collapse" like building a house. The walls and pillars of a house must be strong and straight. If they are not strong and straight, the house will collapse; the cavity tone of singing is also like this. If a certain word is not firm, or not loud, or not high, the cavity tone of the entire sentence will collapse. Anyone who is proficient in singing, the most important thing is to understand this principle. If you don't understand this principle, and just talk about the yin and yang of the word sound, it is like a novice "Liba". True connoisseurs will secretly laugh at him. Old Tan (Xinpei) is really an expert, he does have a teacher. When singing this word, he does not sing the low-pitched sound. In the "Gongpu", it is the upper character, not the combined character, because it originates from Kunqu opera, and the character belongs to the Central Plains. (The "thief" character in the previous sentence "sweep the thieves" using "Chi Shang Shang" is also this principle.) Mr. Chen Yanheng knew it, and taught us like this, I remember it carefully and dare not forget it. I have also privately studied this "thief" character, and it must be sung like this, without any doubt. Even if the boss of Qicheng is underground, I dare to insist on this statement, without the slightest hesitation. Yu Shuyan also once stayed at Chen's door, but he sings this "thief" character differently. Try listening to Shuyan's singing, the thief character sings the low note of "He Si"... He is from Hubei, and sings this thief character using the example of the Hubei and Guangdong accent Yang Ping tone low pronunciation, thinking that he has the merit of reversing the chaos, but how does he know that he has the suspicion of a beauty following a thief and the delusion of building a car behind closed doors! From Shuyan down to the actors, as well as the amateur fans who study yin and yang word sounds, they all sing this thief character as the low note of "He Si", greatly violating Old Tan's singing method. From the micro of this one word, it can be determined the false and not false of learning Tan. Isn't the relationship of this one "thief" character great!</p>
<h3 id="e184">Old Tan Sings "The Empty City Stratagem" in Nine Acres, Detailed Supporting Cast, Reported by Cao Fuchen <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>Because recently there has been talk about the supporting cast of Lao Tan singing "The Empty City Stratagem" in the Nine Acres New Stage, there seem to be some discrepancies in the facts. Xiao Cang entrusted Ms. Wei Xinlv to ask the old actor Cao Fuchen, who had played Sima Yi in Lao Tan's "Empty City Stratagem", to report the historical facts. He also had a detailed talk with Cao Fuchen on the mainland radio station. Recently, Cao Fuchen also wrote down all the supporting roles in Lao Tan's "Empty City Stratagem", including the qintong and the reporter, which can be regarded as a precious anecdote in the pear garden. I write it out for the fellow fans, and also declare to the Shen Bao that I will refuse to pay, to show that I am not writing for manuscript fees, but to let the general opera fans know this anecdote.</p>
<p>Old Tan sang for a short period in the Nine Acres New Stage, and lived in Room 1 on the lower floor of the New Hotel on Second Ma Road. He sang for five days first, went to Putuo to offer incense, and after returning to Shanghai, he sang for another five days.</p>
<p>The entire supporting cast of "The Empty City Stratagem":</p>
<p>Lao Tan (Zhuge Liang), Xia Yuerun (Zhao Yun), Zhang Shunlai (Ma Dai), Pan Yueqiao (Wang Ping), Xu Kuiguan (Ma Su), Zhao Wenlian, Pan Haiqiu, Jiang Ruifang, Hu Xiulin (four children, four children appear when Jieting is lost, only two children appear in "Empty City Stratagem"), Cao Fuchen (Sima Yi), Fan Liankui (Sima Shi), Zong Yuankui (Sima Zhao), Xia Yuehua (Zhang He), Zhang Sanqing (reporter), Xia Yueshan, Qiu Zhiyun (two old soldiers), Wang Sanhu (reporter) (when the third time), Pan Guifang (the person who offered the map)</p>
<p>Among the above actors, those who are still alive are Xu Kuiguan, Cao Fuchen, Zhao Wenlian, Pan Haiqiu, Jiang Ruifang, Hu Xiulin, and Zhang Sanqing. The rest have passed away. Among them, the recent situation of Pan Guifang is unknown. (Refuse to pay)</p>
<h3 id="e185">Record of the Golden Charity Opera <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Tang</p>
<p>(Editor's note) The Golden Charity Opera was performed on June 26th and 27th. Mr. Yu Tang and Mr. Yuhong's opera reviews have been arranged for many days. Due to the crowded manuscripts, they can only be published today. Please forgive the two gentlemen.</p>
<p>Last night the Golden Theatre performed a charity opera. At seven o'clock, I took my seat and "came early". Mr. Feng Weide knew that Mali was opening the gong, so he sang only one act because it was a matinee. His voice was dark and had a lot of charm. He learned Zhou and there was something. Feng went down and Miss Fu Yuntai's "Fish Intestine Sword" came on stage. The play was taught by Mr. Shaoqing, and he personally played the qin, so it was extraordinary. Her singing and pronunciation had an antique charm. Miss Fu might as well seize the seat of Xiaodong and replace her. Fortunately, she paid more attention to her face and body. Then came Mr. Ou Shounan's "Stick Beating", which was Ou's masterpiece, and the people of Shanghai had been craving it for a long time. The whole play was performed for eight quarters, and the audience held their breath and listened without any noise. Ou's appearance was beautiful, his Beijing dialect was fluent, and his voice was sweet and smooth, and his singing was novel. I alone felt that there were five points in his expression that were outstanding and worth writing: (1) When Jin Song shouted for Mo Qi to leave, usually Jin Yunu said, "You come back to me!" At this point, Ou opened the door and pretended to be cold, saying, "What a heavy snow!" Subtly indicating the intention to stop him, which is just right for a girl's identity. (2) After learning that Mo Qi was a scholar from this city, he hurriedly told his father, with a shy expression, which was very suitable for the plot. (3) Mo Qi passed the exam and suddenly became arrogant. Jin Yunu was in pain inside and forced herself to endure it, and her expression was realistic. (4) When getting on the boat, Mo Qi took the lead in pushing her away, first wanting to jump into the river, then wanting to turn back, and finally enduring her anger and boarding the boat because Jin Song was old, a kind of sad and desperate expression was moving. (5) Kneeling and begging the adoptive father to pity her was extremely lingering and affectionate. Observing the subtlety and thoughtfulness of his expression, I felt that his fame was not accidental. Zhuang Xiaogu's Mo Qi and Li Zaitian's Jin Song were all competent. The finale was Mr. Zeng Xinzhai's "Selling the Horse and Pawn the Halberd". Mr. Zeng originally scheduled the play to be a complete "Empty City Stratagem". Later, because the time was not enough to allocate, he changed to singing "Selling the Horse". He also thought that it was too late, and voluntarily omitted the halberd. His drama virtue is many. The singing and acting were very similar to Jupeng. The section of the shopkeeper Dong was hit by the whole house, and the rocking board was also in the middle of the fine ink. I heard that Mr. Zeng wanted the halberd and had a unique place. Because I didn't get to see it, I had to blame the carelessness of the drama director that day. The finale was Miss Xiao Ming's "Satisfied Fate", and Jiang Shiyu temporarily replaced Gu Chuanjie to play Lu Kunjie. Did he want to hide his clumsiness by knowing that he was not good at Beijing dialect? However, the general trend has passed, and even if there is Hibiscus Grass, it cannot be saved. It was late and the rain was heavy, so I left my seat and returned.</p>

<p>Cantonese films prepare to compete with Western films, Peng Fei and Li Zhuozhuo are the male and female protagonists</p>
<p>Hollywood's "Tarzan" has won the support of thousands of movie fans, from "Tarzan of the Apes" to "Tarzan's Peril", which made the film company boss make a lot of money. So smart Chinese film merchants are also preparing to do such a thing. Recently, in the film industry of South China, someone is preparing to produce "Chinese Tarzan".</p>
<p>"Hercules" Peng Fei has been selected to play the male lead of "Chinese Tarzan". Peng Fei came to Shanghai once not long ago. His mission had two tasks, one was to invite Li Hong to play the female lead in this film (the rumor was Bai Hong, which was wrong). ) The second is to transport props. Now Peng Fei has returned to Hong Kong! Inviting Li Hong was not successful. The first reason is that Li Hong has a contract with Xinhua Company, and the second is that Li Hong is slightly shorter. Now Li Zhuozhuo has been hired to take the position, and Wang Cilong succeeded in contacting him. As for the props used in the film, Peng Fei has brought them to Hong Kong. Among them, the most eye-catching is the solid iron load, which is five sizes, weighing from 100 pounds to 350 pounds. This is what Peng Fei uses to practice his strength.</p>
<p>Since separating from Zhang Ji, Li Zhuozhuo has lost a lot of weight instead. The other day, Hong Kong China competed in baseball with the Friends Beer team, and Li Zhuozhuo also occupied a seat in the stands. Although she was still as bold as before, she was not as strong as before.</p>

<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association invited famous amateurs from home and abroad to perform charity dramas. There were many public performances in the two nights, and many famous amateurs participated, and there were four dramas with special and outstanding results:</p>
<p>The first night was Xu Heizhen's "Six Departments of Trial". Xu specializes in cold dramas. This drama has been recognized by modern famous actors as a drama that is absolutely not fashionable, but Mr. Xu performed it with singing, recitation, and acting. Although it was only one act, he was as skilled as a professional. His voice was also exceptionally good, a masterpiece. Xiao Beiqiao's "Stealing the Imperial Horse". It seems to follow the example of Hou Xirui. The frame is stable and the momentum is majestic. The recitation is especially good. It is not easy for amateur fans to get this. The second night was Miss Xiao Ming's "Satisfied Fate". Miss Xiao is known for her singing and acting skills in Pingju Opera. "Satisfied Fate" that night focused only on recitation, expression, and body, so it failed to show all of Xiao's art. Miss Xiao's appearance on stage that night was very graceful and light. Only those who are old in this way can achieve this. The recitation was clear and moving, and every word was like a pearl. The acting and expression were lightly sketched and natural and stable. Among the female actors and female amateurs in Shanghai, Miss Xiao can be regarded as an outstanding talent. That night, she was also assisted by Furong Cao and Jiang Shiyu's green leaves, so it is appropriate that the audience applauded and praised her. Zeng Xinzhai's art has long been known in Jiujiang and Nanchang. This time on stage, his singing, recitation, acting, and demeanor were all outstanding and amazing. His stage steps were especially good, and even famous actors at home and abroad could not match him. A song came, which was smooth and hearty. It is a pity that he did not perform the complete "Empty City Stratagem". (Refuse to pay)</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The reason for Jin Shaoshan's popularity after going north</p>
<p>In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, when the sentence was on the road, when he arrived in Shanghai, Baosen was still out of voice and had not recovered. He was deeply afraid that Shao Yu would be able to eat it when he sang "Catching and Releasing" in the first day. ""Keng" means that when two actors sing a play together, they do not give way to each other and sell enough voice. If they don't eat each other to the point where they are willing to bow down, the actors in the Pear Garden often say that someone has been eaten by someone. ""Pull it down", which means this). So when he visited the guests, he asked me to plead with Shaoshan first. On that day, Shaoshan and Lao Yuan came together. After I explained to Jin about the intention of asking him to take care of Baosen, he immediately said, "Our superiors are all in good relationship, of course we won't make it difficult for him." Everyone was very happy during the banquet. Jin initiated that those who could sing would sing an excerpt each. After Baosen finished singing, everyone's eyes were focused on Shaoshan. Unexpectedly, he was also very understanding. Without waiting for everyone to open his mouth to him, he said to Sun Lao, "Uncle Lao (Xiushan and Lao Yuan are sworn brothers), please pull a section for me to sing." I saw that he was extremely cheerful and had no bad habits of being pretentious after becoming a famous actor, so I also said, "If you want to sing, you have to sing a big section, so that we can enjoy the fun of the opera. Then, I would like to trouble you to come to a section of 'Assassinating the Liao'." Who knew that as soon as his "The countries are in turmoil..." came out, he scared the two children in the downstairs compartment to cry; in an instant, the children's parents all ran upstairs, stretched their heads and looked into the room to see who would have such a thunderous voice. Later, when they learned that it was Jin Shaoshan, they were all silent and stood to listen, and thought it was a very rare opportunity. Three days later, Xun Yang came to the stage. Whenever Shaoshan and Baosen co-starred in "Catching and Releasing", "Empty City", and "Famen Temple", he always lowered his tone, and he would only occasionally ask for a good after Baosen received applause. He never robbed the head of the protagonist of applause, which shows that he is very loyal and pays attention to old friendships.</p>
<p>Speaking of his unforgetting of old friendships, I also thought of the Pudong Du Ancestral Hall meeting that year. When I went with Li Weiwu, Ye Yongfang, Zheng Zi , Cheng Junmou and other gentlemen on the first day, I met many Pear Garden friends in the backstage. Each of them was lying on a couch, busy filling up with energy to dress up for the opera. As for eating, it was a secondary issue, because there was an original "full blow, hungry singing, qi drumming" , so before the opera is finished, they are not anxious to eat. (53)</p>

<p>Regarding my feelings about film work: This is a career I should strive for. Of course, I hope to gradually improve and achieve great success. However, I also believe it is closely related to age and may not be a lifelong career. Therefore, the idea of striving for further education becomes even more important.</p>
<p>Here, I want to talk about love and marriage. It's really ridiculous: not long ago, a certain publication said, "Lu Ming's criteria for choosing a husband are having land as large as a racecourse and ten million pounds." This joke is not a big deal, but there are many female classmates who ask when they meet or call to inquire about the truth of the matter. These unfounded rumors are both infuriating and hilarious. My consistent view is to oppose talking about love, especially before a career is successful. We should absolutely not talk about love. Another saying is, perhaps talking about love is something for the leisure class? Under the arduous work of filming a movie in one and a half months, trying to improve my studies, my energy is often not enough. Time and money are not things a person with leisure has. The word "love" has not even crossed my mind, so how could I further discuss marriage and what conditions? Isn't this too ridiculous?</p>
<p>Finally, I believe that some people think that movie actors are generally accustomed to romantic life and hedonism. This superficial observation is actually very wrong. As for myself: my current life is no different from my student days. I live under strict discipline and have never had any excessive desires or actions. (End)</p>
