<p>社評</p>
<h3>侵略與反侵略</h3>
<p>路透社一個外交記者報吿說：「國際火燄的灼熱；一些沒有冷却的徵象。」這句話正概括的指出了目前國際局勢的嚴重性。是的，歷史已到了一個突變的時期，世界已處於再分割的漩渦中。恫嚇，呌囂，怒吼，哀鳴：攪成了一片混亂的聲音，敲詐退讓，縱橫椑闔，又交織成爲滿目迷亂的圖畫。</p>
<p>然而在這錯綜複雜的形勢中，我們郤也看到了國際陣綫分野的日益明期化。一面是侵略陣綫的呌囂跋扈日益加甚，一面郤是和平陣綫的民主國家的漸趨凝結。中間沒有第三條路。即使像英國首相張伯倫，雖然至今還沒有放棄對侵略者妥協的幻想，可是客觀形勢也終於逼着他不得不進行反侵略陣綫的組織，不得不「移樽就敎」地去拉攏蘇聯以及聯結小國，……一句話，不得不重又向集體安全的路走去—固然，由於英國態度的始終遊移，離集體安全的實現還有相當距離。</p>
<p>最近國際上事實的發展，無一不表現着侵略與反侵略兩種勢力的搏鬥羅斯福總統，對德義的警吿，赫爾對日强硬的抗議，以及美國艦隊的駛回太平洋，表示着和平陣綫支柱之一的美國，是正在給英國所號召的集體安全運動以很大的聲援；英土協定的簽訂，英蘇談判的接近，表示集體安全制正在逐漸演進。上面這幾個因素，都可說是反侵略的和平陣綫進展的明證。另一方面，侵略陣綫國家也在和平陣綫日趨凝結的壓力下，進行着外交上的攻勢。第一，希特勒一面百計脅誘英國，阻止她和蘇聯去接近；一面又作大規模的外交活動竭力拉攏南匈，以及其他諸小國；第二，義大利也盡力勾結南斯拉夫，並企圖把南斯拉夫從國聯拉出，而拉進「反共」公約去；第三，日本惟恐集體安全擴充到遠東，竟嗾使其御用報紙厲行反英運動，以脅誘英國，並響應德義。</p>
<p>從上面的事實看來，可知隨着侵略勢力進攻的加緊，反侵略勢力也在節節發展着，集體安全已在逐漸演進中。</p>
<p>和平不可分割，集體安全當然不能僅限於歐洲，還必須擴展到遠東。二十二個月的抗戰，證明中國是站在反侵略的最前綫，她是和平陣綫的支柱。她不僅爲她自己的生存而戰，同時也爲了世界和平而戰。中國的抗戰完全符合了和平陣綫國家—英法美蘇等國的利益，它應該獲得和平陣綫所有國家的同情和援助！</p>
<h3>紅星報論　華軍反攻勝利　華軍已爭得主動地位　戰鬥力高强予日重創</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）紅星報論最近中日戰局云、「日本於佔領南昌及牯嶺後、原以爲華軍戰鬥力將受打擊、抗日民族統一戰綫將發生動搖、然而其後之事實、則證明華軍作戰力量不但未曾削弱、反而進至在極長前綫上展開積極活動、過去十餘日作戰情形、證明華軍在各綫均爭得主動地位、頗有進展、截至四月廿日、日軍已被迫退出縣鎭七十餘處、」</p>
<p>「華軍之積極活動、業已表明其戰鬥力之高强、道德及政治的意志之堅定、證明中國決計抗戰到底、直至得到最後勝利爲止、」該報結論稱、「吾人卽今已可斷言、日軍在數處戰塲已遭大敗、而華軍形勢則已改善不少、其高强之戰鬥力亦已表現」云、（廿三日塔斯社電）</p>

<p>（一）在被日寇「佔領」的廣大區域上面、敵人所能確實佔領的、不過是幾個大城市、幾條交通綫、及若干軍事據點而已、其餘大部分的國土、都在我們統制和控制之中、（本年二月份行政院戰地縣政情形統計指出、（甲）在戰區蘇·浙·皖·贛·冀·豫·魯·晋·閩·鄂·湘等省九百四十一縣中、縣長不能行使職權者僅五十五縣、（乙）縣區一部份被佔、縣長仍駐縣城行使職權者二十五縣、（丙）縣城淪陷、縣長遷鄕辦公者二百四十五縣、（丁）縣長移駐鄰縣、但仍能行使職權者廿三縣）、同時我們已經在這廣大的區域上面、建立了許多抗戰根據地、留下了許多正規部隊、組織了許多游擊隊、其活動範圍、自六七縣至數十縣不等、所以部長指示我黨政人員及革命幹部、凡屬敵後地區者、皆應留駐敵後、同時全國上下皆應以敵人後方爲我革命工作之重要對象、</p>
<p>（二）敵人武力侵略的策略、原冀以軍事爲手設、達成其經濟掠奪的目的、又以政治爲手段、掩飾其武力侵略的事實、敵人到處嗾令漢奸成立傀儡組織、同時利用漢奸、創立各種强盜公司之名、以實行其掠奪之實、就是這種陰謀的具體表現、針對着敵人這秘陰謀、我們必須以軍事掩護政略的進攻、以政治助成軍事的勝利、執行道種對策、需要戰地政治宣傳工作負担更大的任務、</p>
<p>（三）在二期抗戰的今日、敵寇「速戰速決」的戰略、以至「速和速結」的政略、都歸失敗、陷於進退維谷、欲罷不能的絕境、弄得兵力不敷分配、財政羅掘俱窮、不得不發出「長期戰爭」的哀鴻、和「長期建設」的口號、所謂「長期建設」、其實也就是「長期戰爭」、就是企圖利用我戰地的人力物力、來做進一步侵略中國的資本、據最近情報、敵人加緊援助僞「新中國政府」之建設、（甲）固守佔領區、積極整理培養元氣、最低限度亦須能供給敵派遣軍在華軍實之需要、（乙在大塲·眞茹·南翔·江南一帶廣事墾植、由倭民移往耕種、（丙）敵對所辦之「中日合作」各工廠加以人力物力財力之統制、以期供共對華長期戰爭之需要、並仿蘇聯遠東軍區辦法、我們要打擊敵人這種迷夢、首先要做到使敵人無從在戰地中掠奪資源、編練僞軍、這一任務大部分要落在戰地政工人員肩上、必須廣泛深入敵後、發動游擊戰爭、鞏固各地革命政權、破壞敵人之交通、阻撓敵人政治經濟文化之一切設施、務使敵人疲於奔命、爲我革命勢力所包圍打擎、以至於崩潰、（陳部長語）</p>
<p>（四）第二期抗戰的特點、在於轉守爲攻、轉敗爲勝、一方面要阻止敵人的進攻、一方面要準備我們爭取最後勝利的總反攻力量、故戰地政工必須加緊動員民衆、發展游擊戰爭、牽制與分散敵人更大的兵力、使他們無力而且不敢放膽進攻、同時在敵後準備更有戰鬥經騐的部隊、團結更有覺悟的民衆、俾將來總反攻時可用以夾擊敵人、截斷敵人的歸路、（五）戰地處在敵人後、時時可以遭受敵人的威脅攻擊、經常不易獲得我們後方的接濟、因此必須加緊政治宣傳工作、提高戰地部隊和民衆之民族意識與犧牲精神、必須「無限的提高了」政治工作的重要性」、才能達成此神聖偉大的任務、（未完待明日續）（二十四日電）</p>

<h3>德義兩國外交反攻　力謀離間巴爾幹各國　南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞徬徨歧途　張伯倫聲明英正與俄土談判</h3>
<p>（倫敦）國際時局之中、茲有三事、最為此間各報所重視、即（一）羅馬尼亞國外交部長茄芬哥所與英國當局進行之談話、（二）英國駐德大使漢德森爵士之突然返任、（三）柏林羅馬軸心在外交上之反攻、關於第一項各報咸謂、英國若不予羅國以經濟的援助、即無法使之抵抗德國東進政策、每日電聞報載稱、英國當在貿易上以種種便利給予羅國、此舉匪特足以直接援助該國、且間接足以左右巴爾幹協商其他各國、即南期拉夫土耳其希臘三國之政策、各該國處境艱難、現正徬徨不定、他日之去就從違、殆視茄芬哥外長到倫敦後所獲之結果為轉移、關於第二項、各報雖不無驚異之表示、但官方對此迄無說明、故此舉是否適合時宜、論壇殊見冷淡、惟金融泰晤士報載稱、「漢德森大使之返任、未可視為英德兩國關係、巳有何種新發展、亦未負有新仟命」關於第三項、曼哲斯德保衛報載稱、德義兩國目下努力之目標、端在共同控制巴爾幹半島、南斯拉夫首當其衝、故對各該國利誘威脅、迫以保持所謂中立、實即左袒羅馬柏林軸心之謂、俾軕心各國軍艦得以利用南國之港口、共陸軍部隊得以利用南國之鐵路、其飛機得以利用南國之領空、如是而已、「南國倘能自他國獲有保障、則其對於德義兩國之苛求、自必加以抵抗、所惜西歐各國從未切實有所作為、以加强南國抵抗之勇氣、遂致德義兩國予取予求耳」云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）軸心國現在準備第二劑誘引藥、以待南斯拉夫外相馬柯維志之來臨、南外相定四月二十六日來此、官塲對之、抱有甚大希望、德國增進巴爾幹諸國親密關係之計畫、現漸公然採行「抵制包圍集團」之形式、此間政界確信、匈牙利與保加利亞定可加入軸心方面、而南國則猶在未定之天、故拉攏南國特別努力、大約德國將向馬柯維志聲明、凡義國所視為其在亞德里亞海中之生命後者、德國定予以完全援助、德國或更將以南斯拉夫與捷克悄形相同之形式、提出關於南斯拉夫境內少數日耳曼民族之問題、使南外相有所覺悟、據此間南斯拉夫人各界之意見、馬柯維志將竭力保持中立、不受任何拘束云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）首相張伯倫今日在下院宣稱、英政府現正與其他政府維持密切接觸、土耳其及蘇聯亦在其內、惟渠對於以前迭次所發之言論、尙未能有所增益云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法德三國外交　漸次恢復常態　英駐德大使已返任　法德使節亦將照辦</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國駐德大使漢特森已於昨日午後返柏林任所、一般人雖初料該大使未必在五月以前回任、今忽立卽返任、據消息靈通方面聲稱、此並無任何政治意義、聞法國駐德大使古隆德亦將於二三日內由巴黎返任（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國駐德大使漢德森係於上月十九日卽德國兼併捷克之後、奉召回國、為時已逾一月、頃於本日午後二時、返歸柏林任所、政界某某人士、頃加以評論云、英國政府又復出以綏靖舉動、俾德國懸崖勒馬、寗採用談判方式、而不以恫嚇為事、但英國之加緊擴充軍備與組織集體安全、以防止侵略、並不因此而稍行弛緩、此在其他人士則謂、曩日漢德森大使奉召回國、乃所以譴責德國之兼併捷克、今茲政府旣已決定在歐洲組織和平集團、以期一勞永逸、則臨時辦法如召回大使之類、卽已無其必要矣云、（二十三日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（倫敦）首相張伯倫今日在下院答覆反對黨領袖阿特里問曰、英駐德大使漢特森之返任、並無特別意義、該大使近奉召回國述職、事畢、曾請短假、假滿後乃照常例返任、阿氏續問該大使之返任、是否含有政府已承認德國併呑捷克之意、首相答曰、確無此意、且無此理、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國駐英大使寳克遜、不日即將啟程返倫敦任所、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國駐德大使古隆德、前於本年三月間德國兼併捷克之後、奉召回國、頃聞將於短時期內、重返任所、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國實行　徵兵問題　法國敦促甚力</h3>
<p>（倫敦）徵兵問題似將提出於明日之閣議、屆時將有關於此事之備忘錄分交各閣員、惟殊無立時決定之望、內閣明日更將聆取財相西門之預算案、關於此事、一般人惟恐將增加所得稅、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於英國應否實施徵兵制之問題、政府在短時間內、即應決定、各報頃紛紛加以評論、其中泰晤士報載稱、「各閣員大多承認英國倘能成立義務兵役之原則、則在組織反侵略集團時、必可愈益有力、此項見解、不僅閣中如是、即一般輿論、亦莫不具有同感」、金融泰晤士報載稱、「內閣本日開會時、除討論下年度預算外、幷當依據陸相倍立厦所提出之報吿、討論徵兵制問題、據聞陸相業已擬就一種方案、全張實施國民義務軍事訓練」云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）保守黨極右派領袖邱吉爾、頃在倫敦市政廳發表演說、主張現行國民志願服務制、應即改為義務制度、聽衆均鼓掌贊成、邱吉爾之言有曰、「國內輿論、贊成實施義務服務制者、日益增多、此乃有目共覩之現象、是以在短時期內此項制度、當可見諸實際、據余所知、志願服務制所需之各部門人員、均已足額、並已開始訓練第二批人員、衡諸現行制度、包涵之繫複、而得如此成績、不可謂不佳、」時至此日、英國已向歐洲大陸某某國接受約束、「英國旣已提供諾言、自當編練强大陸軍、以為之後盾、」但陸軍現有力量之單薄、實為仇者竊笑、而親者寒心、抑且使愛好和平各國集團組織之進行、因此顧慮而躭誤、要知各該國之集體的兵力、乃係和平最大的保障、此種集團一日未能成立、和平基礎、自即一日不能奠定」云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國駐法大使斐浦士今晨曾與法總理晤談、午後又訪晤法外長龐萊、據時報載稱、此與英國實施徵兵制有關、英相張伯倫現已認識、必須改變其原來之手段、就經騐所得、已表示無平等之實力、決不能從事談判、蓋從事和平與從事戰爭、初無二致、列强必須擁有充分實力、以實施其政策云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>地中海　英艦演習</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今晨倫敦各報載稱、英國地中海艦隊將於二十六日自瑪爾太島開往東地中海、舉行演習、參加演習者共有三十二艘、其中三萬零六百噸主力艦一艘、三萬一千噸主力艦二艘、按該項艦隊為海軍上將保恩德爵士所統率、此次舉行演習、官方稱之為「正當的特殊巡遊」、（二十三日海通電）</p>
<p>馬爾太　據官方宣布、地中海艦隊之若干軍艦、定星期三日起椗游弋地中海東部、計為戰鬥艦賴米萊斯號、巡洋艦蘇塞克斯號、航空母艦光榮號及驅逐艦三隊（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>德報披露希特勒態度自謂已衝破包圍政策</h3>
<p>（柏林）希特勒元首定於本月二十八日在衆議院發表演說、答覆美國總統羅斯福、但澤先鋒報頃發表一文、加以評論、略謂「海外某國所作調處企圖、實欲在他日戰爭爆發之時、誣指吾國為戎首、此種可鄙的策略、德國方面自當堅決加以拒絕、殆有可斷言、希特勒元首並當正吿西歐洲各民治國、和平之為物，初非空洞的方式、實乃一種富有生氣之作為、要在為各種問題、遂漸覓致公平的解決方案、吾國乃以種族主義為基礎之泱泱大國、立塲明確、決不退縮一步、但亦並無推行冒險的政策之妄念、此外、自土耳其國代表團近頃前來此間、向希特勒元首祝嘏、乘便與希特勒元首暨里賓特洛浦外長進行談話之後、雙方睦誼於以證實、德國政府之任命巴本為駐土大使、亦即為絕好之明證」云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）關於反侵略集團事、英法兩國與蘇聯所進行之談話、此間各報紛紛加以評論、類皆借題發揮、以詆毀鮑爾希維克主義、並預料希特勒元首本月二十八日在衆議院發表演說答復美國總統羅斯福時、當將徵求所得各小國之答案、即各該國幷未受有德國之威脅云云、予以發揮、此在政界人士則謂、「奮鬥現已開始」、柏林羅馬軸心分化巴爾幹協商各國之企圖、即使成效未如所期之圓滿、但觀於各該國政治家先後蒞止柏林、則德國對於英國所行「包圍政策」、業已獲有勝利明矣云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）羅馬尼亞國外長茄芬哥、即當前來此間、與英國當局進行重要談話、此間官方人士、對於此舉、極為重視、咸謂該國是否切實加入英法兩國發起之反侵略集團、抑或改與羅馬柏林軸心各國加緊聯繫、當於此次談話決之、羅國亟需增加出口貿易、因而問題之癥結、偏重於經濟方面、英國聞擬在雙方現行協定範圍之內、促進對羅貿易、質言之、即擬向羅國購買食糧、而以本國所造軍火售予之、政府經濟顧問李滋羅斯爵士率領代表團、前往羅國京城、進行商務談話、其故殆即以此、據此間羅馬尼亞國人士宣稱、英羅兩國商務關係能否發展、為事至屬迫切、緣德國自與羅國訂立商務補充協定以還、業在經濟上向羅國積極活動、徵諸事實、厥有數端、德羅兩國商人新近合辦一公司、資本定為三、〇〇〇、〇〇〇鎊、欲以壟斷羅國所產穀類交易一也、德國經濟部專家華爾達、率領該國技師多名、在羅國京城從事考察二也、德國商人新近將羅國猶太人所有規模較小之煤油礦、予以收買、其所產煤油、約佔羅國全國煤油產量百分之十三也、此在各觀察家、則謂在此種情形之下、英國政府、自當竭盡所能、與羅國促進商務關係、務使該國所產煤油、勿為德國所控制、且英羅兩國所進行之商務談話、倘能獲有初步成功、則雙方之政治談話、亦可順流而下、此所謂政治談話、其範圍不外下開各項、即（一）羅國與蘇聯兩國、依照反侵略集團綱領、互相調整邦交、（二）巴爾幹協商集團、應予以維持、並設法加强之、南斯拉夫國態度如何、自亦有討論之必要、（一）匈牙利國倘向羅馬尼亞國或波蘭國進攻、羅波兩國究當如何應付、（四）羅國與土耳其國相互關係、如何予以加强、換言之、即羅國他日遭受侵略時、土國如何立即加以援助、凡此各項問題、加芬哥外長此次與英國當局進行談話時、均當提及之、此外、加芬哥外長並當於事後前往巴黎、將談話結果、通知法國政府云（二十三日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞京城　義國自努力促使南斯拉夫國與匈牙利保加利亞兩國修好之後、此間政界人士極為關切、咸謂羅馬尼亞國與南國訂有巴爾幹協商公約以對抗保加利亞國之領土要求、復與該國訂有小協商公約、以對抗匈牙利國之領土願望、此兩種公約、今後均將等於具文、溯自義國兼併阿爾巴尼亞國以還、其所加諸南國之壓力、已非該國所能獨力抵抗、該國實有喪失行動自由之可能、前當德國兼併捷克之際、羅國政府因恐匈牙利國乘機進攻、曾向南國詢問取何態度、當時南國政府即未明白提出答覆、證以義南兩國近日接近情形、益信南國態度、已見轉變、此際土耳其與希臘兩國、雖仍與羅國保有睦誼、但欲應付當前之威脅、尙嫌不足、所望西歐各國、能加緊努力、以對抗義國之活動、務使巴爾幹半島「現狀」、受人尊重、則羅國幸甚云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）在目前本權勢最盛者當推三位金融家、此三人在現內閣中、皆款任職位、但與日皇關係之密切、卻較任何幕後活動之派系為甚、此三人者誰、（一）為池田成彬、留學美國研究經濟、曾一度任日本銀行行長及藏相、並與三井有密切關係、（二）為結城豐太郎、亦為留學美國研究經濟者、現任日本銀行行長、（三）為鄉誠之助、曾在歐西研究經濟、前會任日本商會會長、與三菱事業有密切關係、現任日本經濟聯合會主席、此三人對於平沼內閣、具有支配力量、假若平沼內閣存在一日、則彼等必能運用其權力、使之遵循穩健的軌道、日本軍部方面對於財閥支配之政策、當然極為不喜、昧於經濟之少壯派軍人、以為公債苟能不絕發行、則對華戰事即無問題、故皆反對引輩金融家、至於年事較高及比較穩健之軍人、深知其對於戰事勝利之把握極為有限、故對於此三人之支配亦祇有接受、此為三金融家皆嘗受歐美教育者、彼等在此方面之背景與彼等之思想見解大有關係、彼等反對日德義三國軍事同盟之緣由、或由於彼等之教育背景、亦未可知、宮內大臣湯淺倉平對三人不主與極權國勾搭、而主與英美保持相當合作之見解、深為同情、同時三人皆深信日本應取撙節國力、在國際上採取較為穩健之政策、據此間消息、現任陸相板垣在陸軍中現亦被自為穩健派而非魯莽激烈者可比、最可奇者、在一九三二年時之荒木、曾主張「日本之精神應展拓至五大洲七大洋、即訴諸武力亦所不惜」、至今亦反對加入反民主這軍事集團、至少壯派軍人則仍在圖謀顛覆保守派軍中之「自由派」、多有被其擠至不重要之地位者、同時為彼和等擁登要津之人亦復不少、小磯國昭之被任為現任殖相、即為少裝派之力、同時會被視為少壯派勝利之一、但據美聯社探得消息、小磯之思想實與宇垣相同、宇垣任外相時、曾因圖與第三國保持合作姿態、獲咎於軍部而去職、蓋當時日本軍人勢力較目前為強也、聞小磯亦屬反對參加歐洲獨裁國反民主之軍事陣線者、至於其他政治領袖亦多認「反共協定之加強」、應以軍火製造貿易之有無相通為限、而不應涉及於軍事方面、（二十四日美聯電）</p>
<h3>美購銀政策　中國有利　時效將予延長</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社紐約航空通信、美國現行白銀法、將於本年六月三十日滿期、或將由國會稍加修下、而延長其時效、亦未可必、查購銀政策、自一九三四年七月一日實行以還、對於中國幣制、頗為不利、迄至一九三五年十一月初聞、中國政府乃抑低貨幣價值、並將白銀歸國有、而與美國成立協定、用以易取黃金、存放美國、此項協定滿期之後、近頃業由中國銀行家陳光甫會同美國財政當局、予以續訂、俾克賡續以銀易金、用以購進中國維護生存所必需之物品、於以見購銀政策在現行形式之下、對於中國極有利益、茲若加以修正、勢必以直接影響加諸中國、而日本在最近四年來、曾以大批白銀售予美國、屆時亦必同樣感受影響、美國推和地購銀政策、是否有利、此項問題常有人提出討論、例如特拉威州共和黨、參議員湯生德、曾於國會本屆會期之初、向參議院提出決議草案、略謂購銀法並無多大利益、應否延長時效、應請國會進行調查、足證反對此項政策者、頗不乏人、</p>
<p>自一九三四年七月一日起、迄至一九三八年六月三十日止、美國政府依照購銀法、共購進白銀一·七一二·〇九三·二六六盎斯、其中僅有百分之十三、即二一九·三五三·〇二九盎斯、乃係國內所產、自一九三八年七月一日起、至十二月三十一日止、又購入二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇盎斯之譜、據一般人估計、其中約有一·六五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇盎斯、來自外國、其中一部份系由倫敦轉口運至美國、確實來源未易查悉、特極大部份乃來自遠東中日兩國、（中國淪陷區域亦在內）則可斷言、日本產銀雖不甚多、但所受美國購銀政策之利益、卻亦不少、該國產額在一九三三年時、不過五·九六七·〇〇〇盎斯、去歲即增至一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇盎斯之譜、至其白銀出口數量、在一九三三年時、不過七·六八二·二四八盎斯、迨一九三五年竟增至二二五·四〇一·五〇五盎斯之多、以意度之、該國在中國與「滿州國」所覓獲或所攫取之白銀、殆已完全運至美國、今後日本倘能攫取中國餘存白銀、（據美國專家佔計、尚有二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇盎斯之多）定必大批出售、否則中國方面仍可在美國購銀政策之範圍以內、根據中美兩國金銀交換協定、用其存銀、向美國購買軍火、美國原係白銀主要出口國、曾在一九三三年輸出白銀四三·二七五·〇〇〇盎斯、迨一九三五年、購銀法實施一年之後、即減至五·二七九·四六八盎斯、至一九三七年、又減至二·〇九三·四三五盎斯、在此期間、中國印度、原係白銀主要進口國、均一變而為出口國矣、</p>
<p>批評現行白銀政策者、均謂其未能使白銀成為一種貨幣的金屬物、反使之喪失貨幣性質、此舉是否賢明、殊屬疑問、各國既以其所存白銀、紛向美國廉價售出、前此凡希望白銀從新成為一種重要通貨者、業已為之失望、彼贊成現行政策之人、則謂此項下政策、足以提高物價、但按之實際、其影響亦殊有限、截至目下為止、美國聯買白銀所支出之國幣、為數已屬不貲、然而物價水準、較諸推行白銀政策初期、僅稍稍提高而已查白銀法規定、美國紙幣準備金、應達到金三銀一之比例、當其在一九三四年開始實施時、政府原應購進白銀一·三三三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇盎斯、時至此日、美國存金數量、較諸四年半之前、又已大見增加、除已購進之白銀不計外、尚須購進一·一〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇盎斯、始可適合金三銀一之比例、國會方面對於此層、反對甚力、他日若果進行調查、則現行政策、或有變更之可能雲、</p>

<p>（巴黎）此間消息靈通人士認法國建設部長孟齊報聘華沙、乃法國進一步之外交政策、不僅增進兩國間政治關係、且欲增強經濟聯鎖、今晨龐萊外長與波蘭大使魯卡西維資之談話、亦具有相同意義、政界人士稱、孟氏乃波蘭外長貝克之友人、此次親往報聘、當設法化解波蘭反對參加英蘇天空協約之成見也、（二十四日海通電）</p>
<p>華沙　波蘭國西萊集省加多維支城、乃係產煤區域、並為治金業中心、法國波蘭合資公司、曾於八年前開始築一鐵道、自該地通至波羅的海沿岸格第尼亞港、自南徂北、經過波蘭國東部、可將西萊集省所產煤鐵砂、直接運至海岸、不必經由但澤自由市、該路線（屬於波國政府而由法波合資公司經營）、最後一段、業已完工、頃由法國公共工程部長特蒙齊、波國交通部長烏利區、會同主持通車典禮、烏利區發表演說、略謂、法波兩國、經濟合作關係、素稱密切、此後當可愈益增進、特蒙齊繼之發表演說、其言有雲、「此次前來貴國、非欲有所忠告、更不願從事煽動、特有不能已於言者、即法國之位置、乃在貴國之側、今日如此、明日亦然、彼此兩國輔車相依、決非任何人所能挑撥離間也」雲、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>義南兩國　談話立新協定</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據路透外交訪員聲稱、倫敦方面對於議大利外長齊亞諾與南斯拉夫外長馬柯維志、在威尼斯會談公報、皆認為係義南兩國友誼進展之又一表示、據外國觀察家之意見、南斯拉夫因柏林羅馬軸心力之壓迫、較距離更遠各國之保障、更為有力、義國在亞德裏亞海又佔有利益、故不得不對之抱親善態度、但南國人民皆憎惡德義兩國雲（廿三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）義大利與南斯拉夫此次在威尼斯舉行之談話、顯未簽定任何新協定、此間人士對此殊感興趣、眾信南斯拉夫現仍於接受柏林羅馬軸收保障一事、躊躇不決、聞此項保障包括撤銷匈牙利對南斯拉夫之要求、如南斯拉夫接受義國之建議、加入反共公約、在義德監督上、改編其陸軍、並與義國締結商約、則義國原擔保南國不受義德兩國之侵略、（二十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>國際反侵略運動會　對英美法之糾正　重慶航信</h3>
<p>美中立法無異助紂為虐　德併捷後英國威望日損</p>
<p>美國三十一團體主張修改中立法</p>
<p>國際反侵略中國分會、頃接美國航訊、述及美國民衆對修改中立法之態度、宗敎界如世界敎會友誼大聯合等七團體、婦女界如大學婦女協社等七團體、職工界如鐵工委員會等十二團體、及協力促進和平委員會等五和平團體、共三十一團體、均已議決、主張修改中立法、須將侵略國與被侵略國加以區別、所宜禁運軍火及原料者、應僅施之於侵略國家、哥倫比亞歷史大學敎授夏特威爾特博士、於紐約卡內基會塲演講時、曾抨擊中立法、謂此案不惟未分侵略與被侵略者、且每因此而助紂為虐、傷及朋友、亞爾班尼主敎阿爾德罕、在協力促進和平委員會召集之演講會中、亦認為「中立法為美國舊日政治領袖神經昏亂或狐疑畏懼之結果、在此世界各處休戚相關日益密切之時、言及孤立、即犯無誠意之嫌疑」、</p>
<p>薛西爾爵士發表反德併捷宣言</p>
<p>據反侵略中國分會息、總會會長薛西爾爵士、近對捷克問題發表一宣言、捷克的最後毀滅、引起德國和意大利御用報紙的讚揚、認為是「慕尼黑」屈服的當然結果這一次他們却說對了、由於慕尼黑協定、捷克已被解除武裝、而無力自衛了、捷克殘餘自由的喪失、祇不過是時間問題罷了、如美國人所說、波希米亞已由民主的堡壘、一變而為德國再度侵略的前哨了、問題是下次再輪到誰呢、也許是荷蘭或者是比利時、或者是瑞士、或者是羅馬尼亞、也或許意大利、要在地中海的都尼斯、或者科西加、或者尼斯、或者在紅海的直布底、或是在西班牙、要收取她的代價了、除非各愛好和平國家、決意努力、透過國際聯盟、以恢復有力的國際秩序、那麼就無法挽救歐洲不陷於國際無政府狀態、或者羅馬柏林軸心的統制了、這正是國際反侵略運動各國分會的一個極好的機會、他們可以促使各自的國家、採取行動、如果法國蘇聯和大英帝國、根據此意以宣佈自己的立塲那麼、擁護與援助者、自不乏人、不過他們必須行動、趕快行動、</p>
<p>薛西爾爵士不幸言中</p>
<p>去年九月、慕尼黑協定之前夕、國際反侵略總會會長薛西爾爵士、會為文致英國每日電訊報及晨報、暢論英國對德屈服、實不能保證捷克不遭受再度侵略、並稱德政府之担保、僅為當時意向之聲明、日後並不生效、時隔半載、今日果不期而言中、原文經反侵略中國分會選譯如下「編輯先生、據貴報外交通訊員稱、政府已向希特勒屈服了、貴報的外交通訊員、一向是以消息靈通著稱的、</p>
<p>據通訊內所說、希特勒氏並沒有使我們的政府相信他的要求是公正的、他祇僅僅乎對張伯倫氏說、他的意思就是如此、於是乎我們的內閣、就決定屈服了、波蘭和匈牙利、免不了會繼起效尤、那來、我們又將怎樣呢有人說、爲補救計、對已被肢解的捷克、應當保護他殘餘領土之完整、目前法蘭西和大英帝國就向他保證說、「遇有外來侵略、必尊重並保持其政治之獨立與土地之完整」、不過問題是已有的保證旣經破壞、另來一個新的保證、又能增加多少力量呢、</p>
<p>德國會附加她的保證、也未可知、可是我總免不了懷疑、因為據若干權威者所言、捷克已經被迫放棄和法國及蘇聯的同盟了、其實就是假定德國也給予保證、試問又有多大價値呢、倒也用不着責備德國之失信、因為非但國社黨政府如此、就是自大腓特利以降、所有德國政府態度、一向都很鮮明、對於他們、國際上的擔保、祇不過是當時意向的一種聲明罷了、對於日後、是並不生效的、</p>
<p>貝特孟—霍爾維格的「碎紙屑」的名論、其實並沒有什麼希奇、這祇不過是德國人對於這個問題旣定觀點的一種簡要說明而已、比羅的備忘錄、很値得我們注意、因為他雖然責備貝特孟—霍爾維格當時的聲明為愚蠢、可是對該聲明的內容、他却並沒有表示反對、目前德國政府的行為、好幾次表示過對於道一類的事、他們是承受德國傳統的觀點的、</p>
<p>因此對希特勒之屈服、就等於捷克獨立之消滅、也等於我們背棄了對捷克條約上的信誓、同時也就是承認國社政府威望之日隆、英國政府威望之日損、總而言之、就是承認暴力是解決國際事件之唯一方法、而放棄了以理性和正義代替暴力的希望、—薛西爾、一九三八年九月二十日、」</p>
<p>宋邵兩會長對美中立法表示意見</p>
<p>國際反侵略中國分會會長宋子文邵力子、頃以美國參院外委會主席畢德門所提之新中立法案、殊多未妥之處、爰聯名電美國不參加侵略邋動委員會會長史汀生·和平運動聯合委員會主席額沙兩伯格·暨國際反侵略運動美國分會會長阿特鏗生三氏、有所表示、原電譯文略謂「茲謹代表中國民意、提供意見數點、即希查照採納是幸、（一）「中立」僅足為較小國家在特殊環境之下、引以為外交上之便利、而不足成為大國國策、（二）以道義言、處於正義罪惡之間、實無中立之餘地、（三）就美國現時政治而論、太平洋上局勢之演進、在國會立法上亦應同樣加以考慮、（四）「現款目運」辦法、適足裨益保有海軍及輸船之交戰國、就目前遠東衝突而言、此交戰國即侵略國之日本、反之、該辦法對被侵略國而運輸工具未見完備之中國、實屬有害、而中國實爲美國同情而願予以援助者、因此、吾輩要求諸君運用權威、以影響國會、以敎育羣衆、以糾正孤立主義、而獲得吾輩願望中之理想、中美二國、均將享其利焉、國際反侵略運動中國分會會長宋子文邵力子叩」、</p>

<h3>温州暫禁通航　封鎖綫缺口未閉　前日甌江砲戰擊沉日艇　浙東嚴密戒備郵遞全停　寶貝輪泊温時被炸受傷</h3>
<p>溫州之甌江、禁止船隻出入後、浙省沿海各口岸、航行全斷、德平·海福·哈納、昨折回上海、謀福昨抵滬、寶利今晨可到、葡輪寶貝號在溫被炸、日艦昨又向甌江放砲、日機昨又飛溫投彈、浙東郵遞全停、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>暫時禁航缺口未堵</p>
<p>溫台防守司令部禁止任伺船隻出入溫州之甌江、並限令泊在溫州之外輪、於二十三日下午五時以前離溫後、溫州昨日起已無船隻出入甌江、甌江口之磐石早已實施封鎖、惟封鎖綫上之缺口、尙未堵塞、甌江以內放有水雷·磐石·黃華·等處、築有防禦工程、駐紥重兵、嚴防日軍偷渡登陸、至於此次之禁航、係暫時性質、</p>
<p>謀福抵滬事務長談</p>
<p>德商禮和洋行謀福輪、於昨日下午四時、由溫抵滬、停泊羅斯福碼頭、新聲社記者昨登輪往訪季事務長、據談、謀福奉溫州當局通知離溫後、於二十三日晨十時離溫、載來旅客三百餘人及貨物等、當駛出甌江口黃華地方、有日繼一艘、向岸上不斷的放砲、途中見有日艦三艘、似係駛往溫州、及至二十四日始抵滬、</p>
<p>甌江砲戰擊沉日艇</p>
<p>又據謀福輪船昌吿現代社記者、泊於甌江口外之日艦、於廿二日上午起、突向黃華關要塞開砲轟擊、並放下汽艇多艘、滿載日海軍、企圖藉砲火之掩護、在該處登陸、華方駐軍、沉着應付、未予還擊、待日艇駛近時、出其不意、突用機關槍、予以猛烈掃射、當即擊沉日汽艇四艘、所載日兵七十餘名、均遭悉數殲滅、無一生還、其餘日艇、均狼狽邊回日　、　是要塞砲台乃發砲向日艦還擊、展開激烈砲戰、日不支即行退去、至下午二時許、砲戰始行停止、</p>
<p>温州安謐居民疏散</p>
<p>溫州本月二十日爲日機轟炸之後、城市居民均已向鄕間避雞、地方雖吿安謐、但有若干商店、因避難關係、不得已暫時停業、二十二日日機三架，飛溫投彈、城區落彈七枚、小南門某當被毀、死塲市民十餘人、當時謀福輪停靠在衛利韓碼頭、俟警報發出後、竟成爲臨時避難所、有許多附近商民、紛向船上暫避、</p>
<p>寳貝中彈死傷多人</p>
<p>日機向江邊投彈三枚、均落永川碼頭江中、其中一彈、適落在葡商康生洋行寶貝輪旁、該處之舢板船二十餘艘、當爲炸沉死傷多人、至於寶貝輪爲彈片所擊傷、船上死二人、塲十餘人、但永川碼頭、並未炸毀、當時謀福船員見日機投彈、因相距甚近、颇爲恐慌、落水之彈、彈力甚大、謀福受極大震動、</p>
<p>德平海福哈納回滬</p>
<p>意商中意公司德平輪·德商禮和洋行海福輪·德商遠東公司哈納輪，均於　晨由滬駛溫、在途中得電、知溫州已禁止航行、於是臨時折回上海、德平暫泊吳淞、至昨日午後始進口、停泊法租界外　浮簡、海福、哈納、昨展回滬、停靠羅斯福碼頭、旅客均已上岸、惟各輪貨物均未卸、公司擬於溫州時局稍鬆、即行復航溫州、而免起卸時受到損失、</p>
<p>寳利折回今晨抵滬</p>
<p>意商義華洋行之寶利輪、由滬駛溫、在溫口外黃衆島裏洋面、爲日艦阻止、駛入甌江後、今因溫州禁止通航、不得已於前晚八時折回上海、該洋行昨接船主電吿、準今晨九時抵達上海、船上旅客船員、均吿平安、所備之糧食雖有限、但決不致發生缺乏、至於德商魯麟洋行之飛康輪、現泊羅斯福碼頭、前日並未駛溫、外傳折回說不確、</p>
<p>滬浙交通完全斷絕</p>
<p>浙東之通航口岸、爲海門·寗波·溫州·三處、今海門之椒江、已完全封鎖、寗波之甬江、己禁止船隻出入、溫州亦已禁止航行、於是滬浙以及港浙之交通全斷、行駛浙東之英商太古·怡和·輪船、均改航他綫、意　　商輪船、德平·海　·飛　·哈納·謀福·等五輪、決暫停泊上海、此外葡商各輪除被扣外、山泰、棠賽·美發·等三輪、亦停泊在上海、</p>
<p>葡希五輪覊留温州</p>
<p>溫州禁止航行之後、所有外輪奉令離溫、惟葡商明和·新德·大茂·寳貝·等四輪、以及希商之三馬輪、現均停泊在溫州甌江封鎖綫內、暫時已無法駛出甌江口、又德商魯麟洋行之高登輪、及德國遠東公司之天寳輪、現均泊在定海、惟天寶輪暫時行駛定海與沈家門之間、</p>
<p>沿海戒嚴恩德滯甬</p>
<p>浙東除沿海各口岸、禁止通航外、均築有鞏固之工程、駐紥大軍嚴密戒備、各地駐軍、枕戈待命、如日軍欲偷渡登岸、決予痛擊、至於意商中意公司之恩德輪、此次特准由滬裝麥抵甬後、貨物已卸竣、本擬即日駛滬、因當局禁止裝載來貨、以致迄今滯在寗波、現該公司已呈請浙軍事當局、要求准許該輪裝貨回滬、尙在請示之中、</p>
<p>浙東郵遞業已全停</p>
<p>上海郵政管理局對於浙東郵遞、如紹興·餘姚·金華·麗水永　·　門·溫州等處、以及浙贛鐵路沿綫各地、無論普通·快信·掛號·大小包裹·暨滙兌、均於昨日下午二時起、停止收寄、並佈吿云、（一）大宗包裹自即日起、寄往浙東各縣市暨浙贛沿綫、均停止收寄、特此佈吿、（二）包裏及藥品個人似裏、自本月二十四日起、所有寄往浙東暨浙贛鐵路沿綫、暫停收寄、（三）小包郵件、自今日起、凡寄往浙東各縣市、一律暫行停寄、（四）滙兌等、由該局長乍配林通知滙兌組·快信組·掛號組·及封發組凡寄往浙東郵務暫停辦理、</p>

<h3>破壞抗戰侈方和平　汪精衛陰謀畢露　竟圖誣衊政府分人收買港滬新聞機關</h3>
<p>日本自鼓吹所謂建立東亞新秩序後、識者均置之不理、其預期之目的、實無法可以實現、最近日又欲利用國際現勢、嗾使汪精衛展開新局面、並誣衊中國政府內部要人同情於汪之謬舉、以虛張聲勢、最近派人在港滬兩地、收買報紙、及少數記者、並利用中華日報原有設備、謀在滬創設民力日報、不日出版、同時籌備民國通訊社、爲其宜傳機關、其目的在加緊宣傳華方無力抗戰、爲汪助勢、以達其滅亡中國之陰謀、但此種陰謀、已爲各方所洞悉、決難得逞、本市律師陳醒民、平日努力社會事業、頗得各界好評、不幸於上月七日被人誘出狙擊、以致受有重傷、迄今尙未痊可、最近陳氏遍閱各報、載有美聯社重慶二十一日來電、汪精衛收買愛文義路華東印刷所、改組新華印刷所、承印各項鼓吹「和平刋物」之消息、陳本係該所常年法律顧問、誠恐發生誤會、茲爲潔身自愛、業已致函該所、拒絕樅續受任常年法律顧問、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、上海英領事館當局、上星期六日召英商華字報紙各發行人往英總領事館會議、作防杜此等報紙刋載反日與親國民政府情緒之努力、聞領事館當局未發禁載之令、但作各種耍求、衆信此乃日領事館當局要求遏止此種親聞、故有此舉、日方所反對者、其主要之點、似在於此等報紙刋載關於精神總動員運動之國民黨新通吿、他如直接訪得之新聞中、使用「傀儡」與「漢奸」等字樣、例如電訊中某某人等演說、引用此等字樣、則置勿論、並以英商華字報紙中各種用語之例證、示諸各發行人、衆信各發行人明瞭領事館人員所舉各點後、或將允許日後不再登用所反對之字樣、但彼等將以英國報紙傳統之自由、與圖予禁止、有背憲法爲言、又聞各發行人曾詢領事館人員、對於本埠日商華字報紙表示反英情緒、巳否採取任何遏制之行動、</p>
<h3>怡和紗廠工人　突遭日方逮捕　聽信工頭誣吿捕去七人　廠方交涉後五人已獲釋　工人行動已被監視</h3>
<p>楊樹沛路英商怡和紗廠、歷史攸久、該廠原有大包及工頭等、担任工人薦用及工塲事務、而包工頭等即從中剝削工人利益、每月坐收漁利頗鉅、迫後「八一三」滬戰發生、該廠地處戰區、曾一度停工、自國軍撤退淞滬淪陷後、廠方重行恢復工作、並將包工頭等名義取消、革除職務、詎該批包工頭仍散集在楊樹浦一帶、隨時向在廠工作之男女工人尋　、企圖搗亂工作、因全體工人、不爲彼輩利用、故無法實現、是以遷怒工人、向日方吿密、云有該廠工人參加反日工作、至放工時、即由日憲兵守候廠門外、將工人七名、由工頭領提、押解虹口拘押、</p>

<p>工人兩名仍未出險</p>
<p>自此案發生後、全體工人、均惴惴不安、對日方無辜拘捕工人、尤爲憤激、要求廠方即予營救、並曾一度發生怠工、旋經廠方向日方交涉結果、除將工人五名、已於前日釋放外、其餘二名、日方認爲與恐怖案攸關、故仍拘押、現廠方尙在交涉中、一面復爲保護全體工人生活安全起見、請租界當局、協緝搗亂之包工頭、同時日方亦派有日憲兵三人、名義爲保護性質、但實際係監视工人行動、</p>

<h3>徐家滙天文臺　（二）</h3>
<p>— 湯銘和</p>
<p>天文的研究</p>
<p>徐家匯天文台的天文部，是設在離上海十五哩的余山，是在一九〇〇年創設的。台中有一個很大的赤道儀（望遠鏡），鏡長七米，鏡頭直徑是四十紛，這樣的望遠鏡有兩個，用平形的裝置，一個是拍照用的，一個是用眼睛觀望的。</p>
<p>世界上最大的和佘山天文台同式的望遠鏡，是在美國Yerkes地方，那個鏡頭的直徑是一米（39.37吋），在美國Mt．Wilson的望遠鏡，是現在世界上最大的反射式望遠鏡，牠的鏡頭是一百吋，現在還在美國建造的一架反射式望遠鏡的鏡頭是二百吋，這是將來世界最大的反射式望遠鏡。</p>
<p>平常對於望遠鏡有一種錯誤的觀念，那就是說鏡頭大了，東西就可以放得大些，其實天體的大小，全可由接眼鏡片來放大，所以要鏡頭大的目的，是在使光度集中。如果光度不够，隨便你放得怎麼大，你終看不淸楚的。</p>
<p>佘山的望遠鏡，能把四度光的星增强到十三度光，在已往攝過太陽黑點。照片一萬二千張，決定過一萬四千個星體的位置，會經硏究一千二百個雙星和羣星，曾經一百多次計算過木星擾亂其他行星之軌道。這是佘山天文台的大略工作。</p>
<p>記者問下次上海可以見到日蝕是在什麼時候，茅神甫答道：是在一九四一年，能見到全蝕的地方，是在漢口和溫州之間，上海可以看到十分之九以上的日蝕。</p>
<p>外埠工作</p>
<p>徐家滙天文台，還進行過幾次內地探險旅行，曾作過長江上游之行，測繪地圖五十四張，決定五十個城市的方位。安南總督也曾請過那天文台去計劃設辦氣象台，中國沿海的燈塔也不時由該台巡視，查察究竟儀器準不準。</p>
<p>（三）現况</p>
<p>徐家滙天文台，由法國敎會，法公董局，各船公司等津貼的，在戰前中國政府亦出資津貼的。台中一切，由神甫負責。當初羅馬敎皇把徐家滙敎區劃爲法國敎會管理，所以台中的神甫大都法國人，但是現在也有一個意籍神甫。</p>
<p>歷任神甫</p>
<p>天文台的第一任主任是Dechevrens神甫，第二任是Chevallier，第三任是Froc神甫，第四任，即現任；是Lejay神甫。第三任神甫任期最長，共二十五年，他有「颶風之父」（Father　of　Typhoons）的稱呼，可知他對於預測颶風的供獻了</p>
<p>現任神甫是：主任雁神甫（P．Lejay），龍神甫（E．Gherzi）負責氣候和地震，現在由茅神甫（L．Dumas）——即記者所拜訪的——代理負責氣候和地震，卜神甫（M．Burgand）負責電磁和時計，常來回於佘山上海之間，因爲自從戰事以來，蒃葭浜的電磁部已經遷往佘山了，衛神甫（E．de　la　Villemarque）負責佘山天文台。</p>
<p>戰時狀况</p>
<p>自從這次中日戰事爆發以來，長江和中國內地的政府氣象報吿站，都停止工作了，所幸太平洋各站和福州汕頭，還繼續工作。所以對於颶風預測工作，仍舊沒有受到什麼影響。據茅神甫說，望望天空的雲，已可以預測在二十四小時後本地會不會遇到颶風了。因爲內地和中國沿海的各氣象報吿站，已經全部或大部停止報吿，徐家匯對於上海北平間，上海漢口間，和上海廣州間的氣象，不能準確的預測。幸而現在這三條航空錢，都已停止了，所以預測不預測，都沒有關係。</p>
<p>戰爭對於徐家滙工作沒有直接的影響。</p>
<p>（四）中國的天文事實</p>
<p>徐家滙天文台創設之後，在二十世紀開元就有靑島天文台的設立。其範圍當然相當的狹小。</p>
<p>最近在南京的中央氣象台是中國設備最完善的天文台，比徐家滙完備得多，現在內部儀器雖巳運到內地，但是分散在各處，沒有裝起來用，這是很可惜的事，因爲中央氣象臺非但在中國佔有首位，在世界天文界上亦有相當的地位，雖然成立不久，對於天文方面，已作了不少的硏究。</p>
<p>目下中國並沒有重大的天文工作。</p>
<p>（五）天主敎對於中國天文的供獻</p>
<p>前面已經說過十七世紀時就有西敎士把歐洲的天文輸入中國，可惜國人沒有訓練繼續西人的人才。兩百年後，就有上海徐家滙天文台的創設。</p>
<p>至於天主敎爲什麼對天文，或者說對科學有興趣？是否有一種特別的獎學制度？那可沒有！不過天主敎徒覺得硏究科學就是追求眞知識，根本宗敎跟科學沒有衝突、而且不能有衝突的。這是他們現在所深信的，因之他們對於科學，有濃厚的興趣。</p>
<p>茅神甫還說明了一點，徐家滙天文台的目的，是服務人羣，並沒有什麼色彩的，也並不選揀去服務誰。　（完）</p>

<h3>紗花　華紗津銷突起　日紗漲風如醉如狂</h3>
<p>紗市始跌繼昂、且續趨前進、蓋以汕頭局勢雖見緊張、需要滯鈍、惟香港採辦又轉興旺、北方天津帮素來專辦日紗爲主要、近因華紗較廉宜、將天津恒源·北洋兩廠之出品、二十支三鼎·八仙·十七支三鼎等紗、在市紛紛收進、於是人心振奮、市悄挺進、內地帮意向亦轉變、本紗生意因之轉弱爲强、賣價反見提高矣、午後大部份心意、謂日紗高昂、本街棉織廠業已改辦華紗應用，對於市况看穩一步、二十支雙馬現紗做到四百元、但廠方復來大量開出、然同業心思濃烈、如數被其吃進云、</p>
<p>現紗情形、昨晨初開盤、報載溫州甌江自動封鎖、港口貨運停滯、閩省日艦紛擾、人氣不佳、大家議論有小面、開價跌二元、二十支雙馬紗價爲三百九十六元半、棧單價爲三百九十三元半、少頃廣帮代香港帮仍來採辦、市况頓轉緊昂、買價步步升起、北帮天津客商對於天津貨復來收進、人心更昂、售盤徐徐復升、迨至收盤價、二十支雙馬紗做到三百九十九元半、棧單價爲三百九十五元半、午後開盤市象尤昂一步、內地需求不弱，二十支雙馬現紗價爲四百元、又漲五角、查全日各帮買去統計一千九百三十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲一元半、其他依然穩定如常、廠方由新生廠開出二十支金虎一千一百二十包、價爲三百八十六元、崇信廠開出二十支大發一百五十包、價爲三百九十元、永安廠開出二十支特金城一百五十包、價爲四百零七元半、德豐廠開出十支雙獅八百包、價三百零八元，今日有紗六百十件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>香港　四五五　同行　五五五</p>
<p>汕頭　一〇〇　天津　五一五</p>
<p>雲南　五〇　內地　二一〇</p>
<p>北帮　五〇　統計　一、九三五</p>
<p>日紗市價扶搖直上、且市塲情形大為紊亂、所有做開之行市、往往有數元之上落、茲據市塲言、此番全係天津帮及靑島帮在多頭地位、擠軋甚力、因之漲風依然如醉如在也、二十支藍鳳紗本月份爲三百七十五元、下月份價軋至三百八十元之說、</p>
<h3>美棉出口津貼　將於七月一日起實行惟多數議員尙未贊同</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日因五月份之掉期及銀行界在市購買頗烈、故又漲五六鎊音、華盛頓消息、議員彭克海語人、美總統羅斯福已同意此項棉花出口津貼議案、暫定本年度新花出口者、七百萬包可得政府發給出口津貼每磅二分、此種法案將於七月一日開始執行、有效期爲一年、出口商得請求政府給以現金或貸款存棉、但多數議員對此種津貼方案、俱不贊同、深恐棉價之將暴跌、而迭成新棉再作貸款、但據彭克海之表示、此種新方案能使新棉輸出、而將不作貸款、同時棉價反將上昇、盤旋於九分左右也、昨日印度連同預測跌一羅比、埃及平、折合法幣、計美棉及巴西棉每祖漲三角、印棉跌四角、埃及棉不同、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、殊爲靜寂、良以外棉到貨甚多之故、各廠對於十支及二十支之原棉、據記者調查、已足供三月之用、唯對三十二支以上之原料、甚爲稀少、然此種原料已運在途者、亦甚寥寥、美棉出口津貼如能實現、則各廠均可採購美棉矣、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠如下、</p>
<p>本棉生意尙堪維持、但大量省費仍乏生氣、蓋以各廠購訂之印棉、本月來茲有壹批抵滬、廠方需用充裕、對於高昂之本棉、絕無嘗試之念、故近來成交依然滯遞不旺、浙棉本有三千包來滬、茲已受封江影響、今日仍未曾到申、蘇北一路棉商竭力疎通、運來七百三十一包、開價爲七十八元七角至七十七元、又昨由新港來花一百件、茲將各棉情形列左、</p>

<p>二十四日豆油進口、自大連來七百件、自靑島來二百五十件，生油自靑島來一千七百八十件、菜油自靑島來七百件、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債再疲　中國營業普通股　幾無一文之可値</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市况稍有萎靡不振之象、大都以甌海封鎖關係、人心稍起惶惑、但以無關公價事、午後即見安定、仍不外盤旋狀况而已、人心因此稍有恍惚、散戶浮多稍有出籠、大戶多頭依然屹立不動、趨勢前途仍當暫行盤旋、無大波瀾也、昨日趨勢、上午開盤天生潤利扳價售出、大通同康及十二號均有賣出、買戶幷不踴躍、三開恒孚永康震康以及四十二號均有需要、但均係零星交易、故供求不均、午前小去四五角、午後交易較淸、四十二號繼續買進，永康同康亦有相當需要、賣戶以永豐爲多、餘則興元及三十五號稍有出脫、市况較堅、總計結果略小四角至五角半、成交總數約計七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股八十餘股、價爲六元六角五分、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市甚淸淡、但人心尙堅挺、雖有本星期五德國國會之宜言在前、而賣戶並不因此求售、怡和及瑞鎔股爲卓越瑞鎔股漲至七元零五分、公共汽車股達廿七元（除息）之新高價、</p>
<p>今日閱得中國營業公司改組計劃害、照算普通股幾無一文可値、今仍特准其在新資本中佔百分之二左右之權利、（卽每廿股老股作一股新股、）此計設似大衆可將贊許、至於該公司八厘債券及所欠之息併成之數、以十元之新普通股分派、該新股現値五元左右、則每百兩之公債、可有六十七兩之價値、</p>
<h3>金融　現金一片脫售聲　最後賣方喊至二零六三元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、過程頗呆定、毫無意義、乃因公衆全無興緻、等待時局推移之反映、惟情勢略帶疲軟、中途雖某銀樓復代港帮稍來吸購、但因銀樓帮吐售頗殷、且余號代行販跟踪套出、致潛勢下疲、延至午收退達二千零六十九元、午後因行販及浮多脫售更切、且進者均懷觀望態度、故爲狀愈疲、聞最後賣方曾喊二千零六十三四元脫售之說、結果明則照午收價軋跌五角、實則已疲落五六元、各方人心疲軟、交易平淡、上午成交祇有四百兩光景、下午則一無做開、銀樓飾金屹然不動、海關金暨中英純金等依然呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤暗市下跌五角</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因供求均稀、致久無成交、直至九時五十分、首見錢兌業互做二十兩、二千零七十一元爲開盤價、較之上週末做高一元五角、開後雖某銀樓代港帮吸購、但爲數有限、且銀樓帮與金號吐售頗殷、爲狀略疲、銀樓帮賣予某銀樓五十兩、價與晨開相同、繼之銀樓帮又賣予某銀樓五十兩、價七十元、相同價銀樓帮又售予金號五十兩、後某金號亦賣予現金號及錢兌業各五十兩、價仍七十元、此後錢兌業互做五十兩、價六十九元、不久銀樓帮吐予錢兌業五十兩、價則相同、此後供求沉寂、延至午時未見做開、故午收仍作六十九元、午後因行販及浮多脫售心切、且買戶均暫懷觀望、致爲狀愈疲、賣者價雖喊低至六十三四元、但仍難獲對手、延至晚收時仍未見成交、若照午收價二千零六十九元、結果則較上週六軋跌五角、全天僅二元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千零七十元、收進二千零六十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金尙無更動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、依然屹立不動、大同行仍爲二百十元、新同行二百零八元、收進二百零二元、</p>
<p>中英純金依然呆定</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價、則屬一千二百十二元六角、掛牌海關金未更、仍爲二元三角九分六釐、上海標準標金價亦仍爲一千二百零七元九角、乃二十二日倫敦電、英純金仍平、每盎司呆定於七鎊八先令六辦士半所致云、</p>
<h3>外匯市况　絕無變化</h3>
<p>匯市昨以各大洋行界、雖互相扒結、但因英美等各外商銀行、仍肯源源供塞、且出口洋行暨孟買銀公司、一度稍來吐售、故過程愈形穩定、結果均平、惟中途依然風平浪靜、極鮮變化、交易尙旺、至港滙雖投機商與外行等拋塞、無如華行及洋行吸納尙力、致變方供求勢均、因之結果亦未分榮辱、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期勿動、遠期續縮〇六二五、紐約銀價、依然呆定、倫敦生金仍無升降、匯兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英大〇六二五、對滬·對法仍平、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開、現貨賣價、英滙八便士二五、美滙十六元〇六二五、較之上週末、均無榮辱、開後洋行雖來扒結、但以英行滙豐、頗肯供給、是以爲狀穩定、洋行結進匯豐現貨英滙八便士二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、亦無升降、仍微百分之五·〇〇、此後出口洋行突來塞予進口洋行現貨美滙十六元〇九三七五、於是潛勢愈穩、繼之進口洋行、略又購結某行現貨美滙十六元〇六二五、將近午時、成交轉淸、僅港匯則稍有做開、投機商賣予華行現貨港滙五十六元、狀况亦平、迨午收銀行賣價、英美兩滙、均與晨開無異、</p>
<p>後市洋行首來扒結英行滙豐現貨英金八便士二五、繼之孟買銀、公司突來吐予某行現貨美滙十六元〇九三七五、於是狀况愈穩、入後外行荷蘭華比塞予洋行現貨港滙五十六元、爲狀仍頗穩定、延至晚收銀行現貨賣價、英滙八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、港匯五十六元、結果比上週未午收、英美港三匯、均無軒輊、</p>
<h3>外幣升降參半</h3>

<h3>疋頭　溫州封鎖　國布去路益冷落　東疋北銷更活躍</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨日市面、與東布背道而馳、乃緣溫州封鎖、貨運驟停、汕潮疏散人口物資、辦胃陡落、故實需益吿冷靜、人氣鬆懈、惟川·滇帮及粵之蔴章·雷州北海各地需胃仍强、成交色布·色斜·府綢·漂布·印花色丁等貨六千數百疋、江南游擊區無錫·鎭江·蕪湖·等處、水路貨運繁盛、添辦色布·色斜·粗布·府綢·等貨五千餘疋、蘇北·東台·泰州等地辦細布·粗布·漂布·色布·府綢一千餘疋、漂染布售盤大率如舊、而白貨粗布開盤、雖較上週六每疋漲一角左右、惟旋以手貨廉售、市盤又形紊亂、交易零星、本街批發號辦進一百餘包、細布·細斜交易亦淡、價稍下挫、閩帮以日機猛炸、人心不安、且公生被刦、尙未解決、各貨暫緩購裝、北路天津帮催裝預定貨、條素府綢條漂布新貨、購意稍淡薄、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨日本廠現粉交易、雖値週初、而客銷仍感平常、上午開市後、本客間津者似較活潑、但實際大帮客銷尙難暢旺、蓋近日北洋帮泗水雖已回高、而市面漲跌倐忽上落太巨、使一般搬運客商、不敢多　風險、故北洋帮去化、零多　少、南洋帮去化亦然、統市成交各牌廠粉五萬包許，除本街零批約有八千包外、餘均南北帮及內地各路　去、各廠以目下存底不豐、及洋粉市價堅昂聲中、一律堅守原盤、故二號粉仍爲四元四角半云、今日出口粉有一萬四千五百包運天津、</p>
<p>洋粉　昨洋粉市况、頗見上展、國外定價、迄難合劃、新到貨、亦乏整批抵埠、前到之貨、已陸續配銷、餘剩不多、且以歐洲局勢險惡、執貨者相繼扳持、市面暗升、昨聞北洋帮及本街內地均有問津、計開蝙蝠牌四元二角四分現鈔、菓籃牌四元二角七分現鈔、及雙鷹牌四元四角半之滙劃、均比上週見漲數分、成交總額約計二萬三四千包云、</p>

<h3>記兩客問答</h3>
<p>— 兪松筠</p>
<p>昨之夕，有不速之客二人來，寒暄旣竟，甲客忽謂醫之爲業優於他業，蓋不旋踵而席豐履厚也。余方欲啟齒，乙客爲醫辯曰，爲醫難也。不觀夫近數年來之醫訟案件，層出不窮乎。甲客忽發奇問，曰：「設有一醫師，爲病人施一正當之手術，無何，病人於手術中死亡，則如何？」乙客曰：「此惟有由法院解決耳，偵查其死因何在，醫家是否故意，如非故意，是否應注意而不注意，如係故意，則科以殺人之罪，如係應注意而不注意，則應科以過失殺人罪，如係非人力所可預防者，無罪。」甲客曰；「然。設病家商諸律師，律師爲之調解，與醫家以威嚇，醫家或不明法律，遂受其愚弄，俯首帖耳，聽其支配，或不准其在當地開業，或要求給以死者生命及生者精神安慰之代價，可乎？」乙客曰：「不可，天下無此事也，律師知法者也，決無此等形同昔日之惡訟師也。」余聞之，歏甲客之想入非非，此等事實，余固未之前聞，或亦絕無而僅有也。客去，余思兩客問答之語！不禁不寒而慄，不准在當地開業一語，尤屬駭人聽聞，蓋醫師即犯刑法二十二章第二百七十六條第二項之罪，亦須於確定判決後，方能按照醫飾暫行條例第四條之規定撤銷其開業，決不能以威嚇條件，私行了結也。尤不能以私人之契約，撤銷其開業也。醫師爲病人治療，決無欲致人於死之心，而是否業務上有過失，尤須有各種證據，其中尤以病理解剖之證據爲重，手術中死亡，撇開人情法律兩觀點，亦應硏究其死因何在，故有此種不幸遭遇之醫師，在事出以後，亦惟有待法律之評斷，如其過失屬於自己，固惟有受法律之制裁，但手術中之死亡，原因甚多，或亦未必爲醫師之過失，息事奪人，則必鑄成大錯，反使人藉口，甚至傾家蕩產亦屬可能，嗚呼，若是者，爲醫難矣。</p>

<h3>健康人之血壓</h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>世界愈文明。人事愈複雜。因之人類之疾病。亦隨之而增加。卒中之病。時見於報章。遂引起世人對於血壓之注意。因血壓過高者。常易患卒中故也。爰述健康人之血壓如左</p>
<p>所謂血壓者。即當心臟搏動時。壓出血液於血管中。此時血管側壁緊張。受有一定之壓力。即謂之血壓。故無論動脈，靜脈，毛細管均有之。然普通所稱之血壓。係指動脈血壓而言。此動脈血壓更可分爲最高血壓，最低血壓，及脈幅三種。當心臟收縮時。動脈內壓力達最高度時。謂之最高血壓。亦即普通所稱之血壓。但當心臟擴張時。壓力即减少。此時之壓力。謂之最低血壓。最高血壓與最低血壓之差。謂之脈壓。或謂之脈幅。測定血壓時所用之器械。名曰血壓計。此雖有水銀檢壓計及彈機性壓力計之分。但其原理則一。又其所表示之數目。即指幾何公厘水銀柱而言也。</p>
<p>健康人之血壓平均數如次</p>
<p>男子　女子</p>
<p>最高血壓　一一一—一三〇　一〇一—一三〇</p>
<p>最低血壓　五一—八〇　四六—八〇</p>
<p>脈壓五〇—六〇　五〇—六〇</p>
<p>上述三者之差。約爲三與二與一之比。</p>
<p>但健康人之血壓。亦非一定不變者。得隨下述情形而有變動。</p>
<p>一，年齡　血壓隨年齡而增加。茲以表示之於後。</p>
<p>讀下表知小兒十歲以前。最高血壓甚低。過十歲以後。即近於成人。達五十歲以上。雖難認知血壓亢進之原因。而亦多少增加</p>
<p>二，體重　凡身體重量愈高者。血壓亦愈高。</p>
<p>三，身長　身體愈長者。血壓亦愈高。</p>
<p>四，性別　女子之血壓多較低於男子。在歐洲人約差七。五！一〇公厘水銀柱。</p>
<p>五，一日中之變遷　早晨最低。隨後逐漸上升。達午後三至七時最高。此後再下降。但亦隨各人之生活狀况而有變動。</p>
<p>六，睡眠　當安睡時尤以熟睡時著明下降。</p>
<p>七，運動　當運動時血壓增加。安靜時下降。</p>
<p>八，精神作用　精神興奮時或疼痛刺戟時。血壓多亢進。</p>
<p>九，飮食關係　一般在飮食後。血壓即上昇。此因胃之擴張及腹壓之增加而起。約三小時後血壓復上昇一次。此因消化時內臟神經緊張興奮及消化成分吸收等而起。飮酒後約半小時。血壓著明上昇。</p>
<p>十，氣候　氣候溫暖時。血管擴張。血壓下降。倘在寒冷時。則血管收縮。血壓上昇。</p>
<p>十一，冷水浴之影饗　當冷水浴時。血管收縮。血壓著明上昇。迨浴畢後。皮膚血管起反射擴張時。則又下降。</p>
<p>十二，溫浴之影響　溫浴時在初期因溫水之刺戟。血管收縮。血壓上昇。後因血管擴張。則復下降。</p>
<p>十三，月經之影響　月經多量之婦人。血壓一時有下降一五公厘水銀柱者。</p>
<p>十四，疾病之影響　凡患腎臟炎，萎縮腎，動脈硬化症時。血壓均著明上昇。</p>
<h3>醫學上食養與衛生</h3>
<p>— 葉俊</p>
<p>人生自呱呱墮地而後，幼飮母乳，漸食粥糜，以至於米飯麵包麥餅等成人之食，有生之日，不可一日或廢，故食與人生，其問題亦大矣。</p>
<p>食肉而少運動者，體必肥，此肥亦病也，病在素食太少而懶於運動。勞力用心而乏食者，體必羸，羸在不知擇營養豐富而價廉之食品如豆類等。居常臨診，常怪世人以有用之身置於不康健之狀態，此種狀態，半由環境所使然，而個人對於本身資源力量所由來之營養食物，不之過問，一切操之目不識丁之厨司，以油煎燴炸爲美味，則良在慨歎，凡曾讀化畢者，必知人生需要之滋養物，除蛋白質，脂肪質，與炭水化物之外，尙有多種生活索Vitamius，爲人生必需品，此種生活素，一遇高熱，即行分解而成廢物，吾不敢在無細菌學知識之社會大衆前，提倡半熟食物，但願世人當顧念本人生理上所需求之營養食物，勿一味以美味爲珍品，而暴珍天物，轉令本身腸胃，受過分之勞力，而無裨益於健康，蓋有時醃菜蔬食，淡肉白魚，反有滋養之效也。此其一</p>
<p>食物之量，當視個人體格，勞力，勞心，運動等之不同而分別之，然一三餐之分配，要當以下表爲凖。</p>
<p>（一）晨起早餐，宜略進流質稀薄之品，其理由爲腸胃經過數小時之休息，一次加入大量之頓食，必害於消化，富有之家，飮牛乳一杯，鷄卵二枚，麵包數片，爲已足，經濟家庭可自備一小型石磨，將夙夜浸透之黃豆，磨成荳漿，用白潔布一塊，濾過其汁，以作早餐，鮮美較買來者爲佳，濾殘之滓，配以冬筍靑菜炒之，以作午膳佐菜。亦可久食不厭。</p>
<p>（二）午膳可稍爲豐當，豬肉牛肉番茄蔬菜等爲最佳之佐飯，飯以衛生米（即糙米因生活素乙存在之故）爲標準，精米徒具炭水化物，設久食而無他種含有生活素食物之補允，必致面黃肌瘦，甚或引起脚氣病，而衝心臟因而致死，此爲數見不少之事實。</p>
<p>（三）晚餐以不過飽爲最宜，古人有諺曰，夜飯少一口，活到九十九，若晚餐過飽，勢必徒勞腸胃之工作，甚或陽胃因倦而滯綿，致食物留於胃腸，發生酵化，而成毒質，患之者，口必臭，晨必不能早起，影響日間之工作，倦怠而無精打采。</p>
<p>今若以一日之成人食量爲二市斤，則分配之如下：</p>
<p>早食　六兩四錢</p>
<p>午食　十六兩</p>
<p>晚食　九兩六錢</p>
<p>此食物對於個人營養之質量當注意者此其二</p>
<p>各人生活不同，環境不同，體質不同，若必責人當食肉若干，魚若干，則僧尼將瞠目而對，且僧尼亦能以終身素食，得享長壽而身體康健者，然以醫學上理論而觀，吾人食物之分配，自以脂肪質，蛋白質，炭水化合物，葉綠素，生活素，無機鹽類等，適量平均投與，爲康强唯一大道，試列表如下：</p>
<p>蛋白質　百分之二十</p>
<p>脂肪質　百分之四</p>
<p>炭水化合物　百分之七十</p>
<p>葉綠素纖微質　百分之五</p>
<p>無機鹽類　百分之一</p>
<p>生活素　含量豐富者</p>
<p>今更舉例如后以作實物比較。</p>
<p>牛肉鷄肉羊肉豬肉魚肉等類　七兩二餞</p>
<p>葱，萊菔，筍，芹，芋，薯芋，慈姑，胡瓜，茄，菠菜，白菜，藕，豆腐，扁豆，豌豆，蠶豆等類　二兩五錢</p>
<p>牛乳半磅，或鷄卵二枚</p>
<p>白飯，麵包，饅首，麥餅等類　二十二兩</p>
<p>然此已爲上等階級之家庭，始得享用，普通以肉類易爲豆腐，蔬菜易爲醃菜，牛乳鷄卵易爲豆漿，在今日艱苦抗戰之日，亦已幸有餘矣，此其三。</p>

<h3>食養之科學研究（續第十四期）</h3>
<p>— 周振禹</p>
<p>（二）食養之應用</p>
<p>生命之所繫，旣屬食養，其應用若何，豈可置諸度外，不作科學上之硏究乎。科學云者，食養之一切問題，不分巨細，具有佐證，以明其理。非若古人之硏究，多爲理想的，或爲抽象的，其合乎實騐者雖有，然不可盡信也。茲將科學硏究之所得，申述於次。</p>
<p>食養者何，人體之原動力也。人體之一切操作，動於內而發於外者，莫不爲生命之表現。故有生命則必有操作，有操作則必有食養，操作與食養之關係，旣密且切，無待言矣。且夫操作，無時間斷，是以原動力之供給，亦必無間斷之時也。原動力之生，猶若機械廠中之引擎與其鍋爐也。鍋爐置水，用煤燒之，水受熱而汽，化汽化而生力，（Energy），導引至引擎各部，推動各部枝體，使生各種有用之操作，吾人利用之，而成爲工業上最大威權之部分。飮食自口至腸胃，經消化作用，變爲人體合宜之特質，由血液吸取之，運輸人體各部之肌系，遇氧（Oxygen）則發生一種慢性之燃燒，名曰氧化（Oxidation），使全體溫煖興操作，無時間斷矣。鍋爐者，猶若人之腸胃也。煤與水，猶若人之飮食也。煤經火化，熱鍋爐中之水，水受熱，至相常之程度，則汽化，汽可推動引擎，致生操作。飮食遇氧而合，則成氧化，其性與燃燒無甚差別，惟遲速有異耳。</p>
<p>引擎各部之操作，若人體各部之操作，引擎操作之能力（Energy），可以測量之，人體操作之能力，亦可測量之，今因便利起見，對於操作之能力，以然量之價値爲單位，名之曰熱量（Calorie）也。熱量者，乃爲一基羅克蘭姆一公斤）之水，受若干熱度，百度表上升一度，或爲四磅之水，受若干熱度，攝氏表上升一度之謂也。作食養之硏究，所用之熱量，多爲千分之一。換言之，所用之熱量，爲一克蘭姆（一公分）之水，受若干熱度，百度表上升一度也。在科學上，用C字之大小寫法，以示其區別。飮食經氧化後，而爲人體應用，其應用之機能，名之曰新陳代謝（Metabolism），另行專論，茲不贅言。</p>
<p>熱量之來，推溯其源，槪自日光，人體直接能用日光者，其量微，間接用之者，其數巨，且以食物爲媒介也。查食物多爲動植物，動植物之生，藉諸日光，例如値物能將最簡單之物質，如動物所呼出之炭氧二（CO2）氣體，與水化合而成一複雜之有機物質。其化合，在植物體內，必經過一度化學機能之作用，且其作用之進行，必須有日光，爲其原動力，植物必須具有葉綠素，爲其接觸劑（Catalyzer），日光受接觸劑之應用，促進炭氧二氣與水化合，而成炭水化物（Carbohydrate），茲列（其化學方式以明之：（未完）</p>

<h3>嘗試</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>從前人說，「嘗試成功自古無，」而胡適之却說，「自古成功在嘗試」，究竟嘗試會不會成功呢？我不是相對論者，然而對於嘗試，却也有相對的觀念：有的嘗試是會成功的，有的嘗試是絕不會成功的。</p>
<p>中國抗戰二十二個月之後，在嘗試着反攻了。這種嘗試是一定會成功的。我們看這兩三星期來的新聞，自從嘗試反攻以來，已經有多少的成績，震動我們的耳目，舉其犖犖大者，則有：開封的兩次收復，贛北的一再勝利，殲敵數萬，而廣州之圍還在日漸逼緊着，大有一鼓而下的氣勢。以此推測，如果一朝彼方筋疲力盡，而我出以養蓄之精銳，舉行全綫總反攻，彼方那有不望風披靡的道理！現在，雖因彼方尙可支持，而我尙未準備完全，所以只小試其鋒，而最後勝利的把握，却已增添了不少。成功在嘗試，在此是必然的。</p>
<p>可是同時，他們也在嘗試着。他們在嘗試着求和。這種嘗試是一定不會成功的。他們勢成騎虎，欲罷不能，所以只好一再放出求和的空氣，以爲嘗試；最近更有託第三國出而斡旋和平的嘗試。然而他們却還在高唱着東亞新秩序，還在作着東亞主人翁的迷夢，換言之，還一毫沒有悔禍之心，而就放棄侵略。這樣的求和，還不是要求我們投降他們？以求和爲手段，以要求我們投降爲目的，這種嘗試，簡直是南轅而北轍，那裏會行得通呢，嘗試不成功，自然也就要成爲不可更易的鐵案了。</p>
<p>於此可見：合理的，有計劃的，有如從事科舉上的發明那樣的嘗試，是會成功的；悖理逆情的，妄想而胡亂行之的，有如投機或賭博那樣的嘗試，是不會成功的。我們的反攻嘗試，屬於前者，夫人而知之；他們的求和嘗試，屬於後者，雖小學生亦知之；誰會成功，誰不會成功，不必待最後的結果，早就可以瞭如指掌了。</p>
<p>因此，我可以加上一句：「嘗試成功在情理。」</p>
<h3>轟炸</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>——徐州突圍回憶記</p>
<p>發了一夜的痧，掮着一顆迫擊砲彈，跟着隊伍通過了死去的徐州，衝出了敵人的包圍綫，在漫騰騰的黃灰的烟霧裹，不停的只是急急的走着。夜色慢慢的由深灰變而爲淺灰，一切被黑暗呑蝕去了的村莊，樹，麥苗…也慢慢的朦朦朧朧的顯露出來了。天上的幾棵失了眠似的星星，無力的脥着眼，曉風輕快的從麥尖上溜過。被睡眠襲擊着。但還像一些機械似的無力的活動着的人們，似乎給把蒙住意識的那雲翳撕去了，忽然淸醒了起來，被疲乏征服得快要癱軟下去的身體，也好像有什麼東西給撑住似的，覺得硬朗起來了。只有兩隻泡破了又起着泡的疼痛着的脚，好像綁着什麼鉛塊，使人拖也拖不動！</p>
<p>夜色還沒有褪完的灰漠漢的天空裏，忽然出現了一隻飛機，聽了那響亮的馬達聲，前進着的隊伍忙散開躺在麥田裹。</p>
<p>舒服的躺在麥田裏，望着那隻不知是敵人的，還是我們自己的飛機，低低的在灰暗的天空裏劃了一個弧形飛去了，散開了的人馬便又匯合成一條洪流，滾滾的向前流着。</p>
<p>夜色完全褪去了、太陽紅着臉，由東方的樹林那邊慢慢的升高了起來，難耐的飢渴使許多人不能不落後了。但前面的隊伍似乎沒有管到似的，仍在前進着。</p>
<p>敵機三三兩兩的老在天空裏翱翔着，隨着一些掉隊的弟兄，散漫的走在田野裏，完全沒有管着，直到牠飛來頭上了，才走到麥田裏去躺起米。看着那耀着太陽的金光，只是在消耗汽池的敵機，我忍不住低低的駡了一聲：「看你怎麼辦？</p>
<p>一路上給敵機糾纏着，挨到十點多鐘，好容易到了宿營地——徐三村了。</p>
<p>這是一個約有三四十家人的小村莊，但老百姓差不多都逃完了。找到了同志們先找定了的一間空屋內，不管身上蒙了一身黃灰，同着兩個同志便滾在一間床上睡起來了。</p>
<p>已經有兩夜沒有閉攏過的兩隻眼皮，剛閉上進入了甜蜜的夢鄕裏。我給一種粗暴的聲音驚醒了，那聲音是那末沉重，混亂，一聽就知道這至少是三架重轟炸機來到頭上了。但經騐似乎在吿訴我們：不能跑的，於是我們便鎭靜的仍蒙着一床灰毡在躺着，屋裏嘩啦嘩啦在講着什麼的人，突然肅靜下去了。大家的心裏似乎都感到一種什麼壓迫，屋裏的空氣變得非常緊張，好像一種什麼不幸的災害就要來臨了似的。但我們默默的只是等候着，等候着這災害的來臨！</p>
<p>嗡嚨嗡嚨的聲音，越來越近，越饗越厲害，好似就要降落到我們的房頂上來的時候，忽然一個驚人的巨大的聲音響了起來：</p>
<p>——嗡　！</p>
<p>像地震似的，屋子在搖着，黃灰從牆壁上，頂棚上，抖落了下來，又向上飛騰着，屋子裏滿是黃灰，使人眼睛也睜不開，炸彈的破片嗚嗚的呌着，飛到屋裹來，但濺到牆壁上去了。</p>
<p>屋裏的人，像失了知覺似的，迷在黃灰裏，連氣也喘不過一口來時，一連串的驚人的爆炸聲又響了起來：</p>
<p>——嗡　！嗡　！嗡　！…………</p>
<p>屋子又在發瘧疾似的搖着，炸彈的破片在黃灰裏悽厲的呌着，我們把頭蒙在灰毡下，嘴裹感覺到有點麻，心裏想：今天一定死了！</p>
<p>但不知怎麼，經過了半點多鐘的轟炸，我們仍舊在活着。敵機投完了炸彈，在頭頂上盤旋了一會，得意的飛去了。我們從死的威脅下，跑出屋外來一看：屋外的打麥塲上給敵機的炸彈挖了幾個大窟窿，附近的幾間高粱桿蓋的空屋，給炸彈震倒了，河堤上的樹枝也給炸斷了好幾枝，但我們住的這間屋子，一點也沒有損害。……</p>
<p>「××帝國主義眞是無聊！他的炸彈，大槪是不要錢買的，你們看，他炸的便是這些東西！——」</p>
<p>「若是他國內的老百姓知道了他們的血汗錢，是給這末來浪費在我們的土地上，樹枝上，不曉得他們心裏會怎樣的痛心呢！」</p>
<p>「單痛心是不行的，要起來反對才對啦！」</p>
<p>敵機又飛來了，我們便趕忙散開躺在河堤上的那樹蔭下，讓他再轟炸去！</p>

<h3>羣龍底歌聲</h3>
<p>— 牆頭草</p>
<p>在沒有星斗的一個黃昏，從繁華的管弦聲裏，酒酣耳熱中，我離了無不散的筵席，踽踽地獨自來到這荒凉的角隅。</p>
<p>被幸福的人們遺棄了的，這荒凉的角隅呵！</p>
<p>凄淸地，三三兩兩的行人，幽靈似地無聲地蠕動着。</p>
<p>（遠處，黝黑的平原上，有猙獰的魔鬼守着夜！）</p>
<p>突然，一陣雄壯激昻的歌聲，自那邊一圈廣長的圍牆裏迸出，交織着憤怒和英勇。</p>
<p>我心頭掠過一層陰影：</p>
<p>記起了這圍牆要邊被鎖着的是八百條蛟龍！他們有過壯烈不朽的史蹟！現在，空有那如虹的豪氣，却被剝奪了自由，加上了鎖鐐！</p>
<p>他們在寂寞的日子裏蟄居着，一股愛護祖國的熱情，以及對於仇者的控訴，油然地發而爲歌，播送在夜底空間。</p>
<p>哦，雄壯激昻的歌聲呵！你顫動了黑暗！顫動了宇宙！</p>
<p>我底心更不住地隨着激盪！</p>
<h3>學推</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>「他家屋上霜」，乾脆「莫管」，這是乖。然而「門前雪」仍要「自掃」，這到底還是吃力之事。那末，不掃又不好，如何呢？哪，可以「推」，推之別人；如不會推，則不妨學起來。</p>
<p>推的方法很多：例如對面有人家的，你就可以堂堂正正的昭吿他說，這雪在他的門前，他應該掃。對面如果沒有人家，你也可以理直氣壯地對左鄰右舍說，這雪在他們的鄰近，他們應該掃。左右如果沒有鄰舍，你更可以一本正經地對過往的人說，這雪在他們走過的道上，他們應該掃。假使你能更進一步，證明這雪的下降，是爲了以上這些人的原故，你要他們掃，便更加可以振振有辭，使他們不得不聽從。假使你能够達到最後一步，證明這雪就是他們降下來的，或者是他們從什麼地方帶來的，那你就格外可以不費吹灰之力，呌他們掃得乾乾凈凈，大功吿成，即使他們因掃而死，也只好死而無怨。</p>
<p>這方法，推，推在別人身上，將過失，錯誤，一切倒霉，吃虧，受損失的壞事，都推在別人身了，而你則飄飄然，坦蕩蕩，坐享其成，何等不美！當今有許多事業大，地位高，名譽廣，財產富，勢力雄的大好老，不論在政界，文化界，工商界，任何界，其所以到此地步的，其中一大部份，就因爲精通這個推字訣。</p>
<p>有一件事情到他們的手裏，眼底，面前，或心中，他們決不立刻去辦。第一步，他們便先看道事是否與他有利。假使沒有利，他就推。他不惜用盡腦筋，費盡心思，施盡氣力，將這事推在別人身上，說道事不是他的責任，即使只要用些微的腦筋，心思，或氣力，就可以辦成這事，他也不願意，他還是要推。</p>
<p>這當然，他們不是天生會推的，也是學成功的。也許最初不推便辦不了，所謂吃不了兜着走，他們受了這種敎訓，而又有志於建功立業，就只好學，學這個推。久而久之，成爲習慣，於是無推不施，無推不靈了。</p>
<p>不過意外的事情，總也會有的：萬一門前有雪，攤得滿地，而可推之人，却連行人也沒有，又將如何呢？難道果然勞動御駕，親自去掃不成？哪，還可以推，推之於無其人，烏有先生，子虛子。換言之，凡事須化血本，總非合算，此雪的責任，旣無人可推，就不妨擱在那裏，不瞅，不睬，或者視若無睹，由牠自己消融，由牠僵在那裏。要說前門不便走，儘可繞道走後門；後門也有雪，儘可走邊門，橫門，側門，旁門，其門甚多；寗願多用力於繞道，不願少用力於一掃，蓋一掃即失尊嚴，即中變一貫政策，即破壞不掃主義。甚至鞋子踏濕，身體滑倒，還是不掃，實行其推。</p>
<p>這種推，推行於一切事，便是挨延。今天推明天，明天再推明天，……。不好的大事，如果因這種推而化爲小事，小事而化爲無事，推者便可自幸有先見之明，故不及於禍。如果竟因其推而無事化爲小事，小事化爲大事，大事又是不利的，也竟可以說，推尙如此，不推又何以堪。反正都有理由，都可以推。</p>
<p>這種推亦非一朝一夕，可以一蹴而幾，也要學。一旦學成，奧妙無窮：可以遠離災難，可以逢凶化吉；至少限度，雖無成功，也不失敗！</p>
<p>以上兩種推，前者是推得掉的活推，後者是推不掉的死推。兩者合而用之，推道庶幾盡矣。</p>
<p>最後，我們記得，還有「孔子辭以疾」這一推，却也不能不一學。這就是說鬼話，造謊，賴，騙煞人勿償命。窮朋友來看你，須推不在家；要當兵，須推有殘疾；要捐錢，須推窮；要參加愛國運動，須推沒有工夫；有約在先，須推並無其事；在瓜田俯身，須推納履，在李下伸手，須推整冠；…………此推學成，集推道之大成，可以與孔子媲美，稱推中至聖矣！</p>
<p>不過批無可推，推車撞壁，弄得頭破血流，也是常事，要舉的，似乎遷需要一些小心吧。</p>

<h3>「糖菓」與「皮鞭」</h3>
<p>— 殷三郎</p>
<p>據報載：法西斯主義國家是一貫用「糖菓」與「皮鞭」政策的。</p>
<p>「糖菜」與「皮鞭」兩種東西，似乎是不相對立的名詞，其實，我們把目前世界動態來觀察一下，並且還不十分健忘的話，一定會感到所謂「糖菓」與「皮鞭」，的確有十分的相連性。</p>
<p>翻開一下近半年來的報紙，就充滿了不少關於「糖菓」與「皮鞭」的偉蹟。不是嗎？東歐那些弱小的國家，像捷克，阿爾巴尼亞，西班牙等國都在「糖菓」的誘惑下遭到「皮鞭」的苦痛了。</p>
<p>法西斯主義國家憑恃自己的武器，無日不在想東攫西奪，得到一些好處。但人類是有着天賦的機智與聰明，於是，法西斯侵略者如果正在覬覦着它的話，第一步決不至於就會拿出自己的本來猙獰面目，它一定要偸襲大人欺騙小孩的故智一樣，去把「糖菜」引誘它，於是，在先就雙方訂立什麼經濟協定，軍事協定，使一個弱小的國家在彷徨瞻顧，遲疑未決的當兒，聽了非常入胃，等到第一步「糖菓」的計策已經成功，就一步步露出原來的一副獰惡相來，及至知道上了人家的當，要想改變方針，那裏來得及，早已嚐到它最毒辣的「皮鞭」的抽撻滋味了。</p>
<p>宇宙雖大，事理則一，我們卽使近一點來看看遠東的那一位法西斯盟弟吧，又何嘗不是玩着這一套的把戲呢？在「七七」事變以前，它老是一貫的把那些「中日親善」，「經濟提携」，「共存共榮」的「糖菓」來餽贈我們的，當時我們眞覺得有些「却之不恭，受之心痛」。</p>
<p>到現在它用着「皮鞭」加緊抽撻，暴露出原形的今天，它還在淪陷區中照常散發那些美味的「糖菓」。什麼「建立東亞新秩序」，「復興新中國」呀，都是些大人欺騙小孩的卑劣把戲，所認爲可惜的是世界上決沒有做到底的呆子，永遠來吃它「糖菓」而不覺苦味的。</p>
<p>到現在，吃了它「糖菓一而受到「皮鞭」滋味的都明白過來，也緊緊地舉起手裏那條「正義的皮鞭」去抵抗侵略者「無理皮鞭」的抽撻了。而且我相信在不遠的將來，準有「正義皮鞭」擊碎「橫暴皮鞭」的一天！</p>
<h3>當心毒蘋菓</h3>
<p>— 周光作</p>
<h3>趙侗將軍素描</h3>
<p>— 周一志</p>
<p>年靑的趙侗將軍，他放棄了土木工程，帶領游擊隊，抵抗日軍。因此他的敵人縣賞十萬元買他的頭顱，但他依舊帶着它在危險中往來着。（續）</p>
<p>一九三七年七七蘆溝橋事件發生，日軍想給予中國一個「致命的打擊」的時候，趙將軍看到他正等待着的機會來了。他把以前很秘密地收集來的軍火，偷偷地運到北平城外的一個中國大學里。當時，他的六十三歲的老母——就是今日全國聞名的『中國游擊隊之母』趙老太太——和他的年靑的妹妹也參預其事。在七月二十二日，他們就起來和日軍反抗。他們一共只有二十四個人，趙侗就被推爲他們的首領。那年七月底北平陷落，數百個北平的中國大畢生撤退到山里，在那里，就擴充了趙侗的隊伍。就在那侗時候，趙侗頸顏的價値由三千元增至五萬元。</p>
<p>趙侗將軍率領的健兒們，號稱一華北人民抗日軍」。他們在華北協助中國正規軍與日軍交戰，大小共達六十餘次。他們的戰略和中國其他各處的遊擊隊一樣，以極少的代價換取蛟大的勝利，襲擊少數日軍駐紮的兵營，或是日軍運輸隊。近來，已有一千多個日兵死在他們手裏，約有二百三十輛左右的軍用車給他們毀壞或奪獲。</p>
<p>趙侗將軍的健兒們常常把日軍的運貨車，目之爲進責納稅的搬運夫」。現在，他們之中有許多人，用的是日本來復槍，穿的是日軍大衣。有一次，他們截獲大量的日軍罐頭食品。在那天晚上，他們舉行一個盛大的宴會，預祝中國最後勝利。</p>
<p>趙侗的餉銀，每月只有五元，但在日本方面，他値到十萬元——六年前，他還只値三千元，去年八月，有一個日軍僱用的間諜，不知怎樣混進趙將軍的隊伍裹。很快的就給同志們發現了。於是他——這個間諜供出口狀。原來他已經在日軍方面得了五千元，等他很順利地殺了趙將軍去報功，又可以得到一張五萬元的支票。自然，最後一張支票，他是沒有到手，而他的性命反被送了，</p>
<p>趙侗的部下對於他們領袖非常忠誠，他們都是平西八縣的土著農民。其中有一部份是給日軍趕出了他們的家鄕，其中大部份的女眷，都給侵略者有組織地侮辱過。現在，他們主要的計劃是利用宣傳以及其他政治工作，來鼓勵同胞，並組織同胞。</p>
<p>在南滿以及北平近郊一帶，趙部勇士施予日軍的創傷究竟如何？在滿洲，七年，他們打死了四千多個日軍，截獲三千支來福槍和十萬發子彈。在華北，自從一九三七年七月二十二日起，他們已斷送了一千以上的日軍，奪獲二千支來復槍，五十挺機關槍和大量的千彈。這些軍火和軍用品，現在都用之回敬牠們原來的主人。</p>
<p>一直到一九三九年一月止，日軍已不止六次派了「征伐隊」來「剿滅」趙侗將軍的部衆。其中最厲害的一次是在去年十月裏。日本方面動員了三旅軍隊，携帶重砲，攻擊茅風山（譯昔）—西山之一峯——上的游擊隊司令部。此外還有十一架轟炸機在山峯上空擲彈助戰。這次戰事延長到二日一夜。當日軍爬上山峯，他們發覺中國游擊隊已完全撤退，而且在撤退時還帶去了所有的東西，這是多麼煩惱多麼掃興的事！他們又檢點山上中國游擊隊的屍體，只有三十四個；而他們自己人却折損了三百多個。</p>
<p>謙遜，誠實而又有禮貌的趙侗將軍在重慶，給予一般訪問者極好的印象。無論在什麼時候，他要是和人家談話，總是談及：「抵抗日本！」和「游擊戰！」。他的一對長睫毛的眼睛，配上黑而濃厚的眉毛，很有力地發着閃光。他是中國最勇敢的鬥士之一。</p>
<p>不久，趙將軍又將回到北平他的弟兄那邊去。依照他現在的計劃，等他回到平西的時候，將予日軍以大規模的打擊。</p>

<p>生活報吿</p>
<h3>嚮導掮客</h3>
<p>— 蕭英</p>
<p>自從嚮導社像雨後春笋般的勃興以後，隨着嚮導社而發生聯帶關係的，嚮導掮客也是其中之一。尤其是抗戰旣興，工商凋零，失業的人數大量的增加，爲着生活所迫而走上這條路來的也一天天的多了。</p>
<p>不幸我也是爲生活而走這路的一個，浪擲光陰，而且已有三月之久了。嚮導社在中國原是某種買買的變相，已爲公關的事實。嚮導掮客是怎樣一種工作呢？讀者不難探索得之，這樣卑微而對於社會羣衆毫無意義的職業，堂我握筆寫這文字時，我是多麼的感到慚愧無地呢！</p>
<p>嚮導掮客的工作時間，大概是在下午六七時以後，華燈初上，便也開始漸漸活動起來，旅社酒樓，是最好的目的地，每一個較大的酒肆和逆旅，都有着我們的足跡。生活的工具，是一本嚮導女郎的集影簿，和幾張嚮導社的宣傳廣吿，其他也像別種職業的掮客一樣，憑着燦花妙舌，以招攬主顧，而　蠅頭微利。工作時間，大概至早要得深夜十二時爲止，有的爲要增多些微收入，而將工作時間更延長的，這樣澈夜的腿酸眼昏，舌疲蜃焦，幸運的或者有近元的收入，有時時機不巧，「吃湯糰」也是常有的。生活也是可痛可憐了。而自工部局禁拘嚮導掮客後，各大旅社也多相率禁止入內，這更予嚮導掮客以致命的打擊。</p>
<p>爲了嚮導社本是靡靡之窟，而嚮導掮客在白天又大都沒有什麼事，因此環境的引誘，也鮮能够不同流合汚的。把這樣辛苦得來的錢，不是賭去，便是挾嚮導女郎濫逛濫玩。爲了經濟驅策，而暫時度着這卑微的生活，或者還情有可原；而寄身墮落之阱，還不知自拔，這實在更罪惡了，希望今日操此職業的，應該猛省纔好！</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第八回　是幻是眞逢塲作戲　宜行宜止到處為家</p>
<p>蘇理雅夫人除了這個製造汽車頌司以外，還有一個家庭租賃汽車公司，這倒是個別出心裁。那是把一輛汽車，造成一個恰合家庭之用，把來租賃給人家，以供旅行之用。這件事情，也是開玩笑開成功的。原來當蘇理雅太太第一次到上海來時，也是金澹雲招待她的，金澹雲自開汽車，到處領她去游玩。蘇理雅太太不喜歡坐小汽車，却喜歡坐寬舒的汽車，因爲她的軀體豐肥，是個雙料身裁。余澹雲陪着她去作郊游，她往住在風煦日暖之天，在車中睡着了。金澹雲笑着說：『要一輛可坐可臥，可以看書，可以寫字的車子，那纔便當咧。』蘇理雅太太道：『有那種車子，在我們美國很多，這呌做「活動之家」。有好多工程師，隨心所欲，他們製造了那種車子。我也見過幾輛，不過有的宜於冬，不宜於夏，有的宜於夏，不宜於冬。有的宜於水邊林下，有的宜於野寺山村。他們就他們自已性之所好，打出樣子來，也不過借此作爲游玩之需，也不免有些缺點。我有一位朋友，他曾經帶了一輛到中國來過，他說這種「活動之家」，於中國最相宜。因爲中國是地方大，尤其是風景之處多，近年來到處開了公路，那種似小家庭一般的汽車，到處可以開得去。我說那種車子，不但可以供游山玩水之用，便是一切的工務上，學業上，都可以需要得，將來地定暢行。』金澹雲道：『爲什麼工務上，學業上，都需要那種車子呢？』蘇理雅太太道：『醫如有許多工程，在深山窮谷中的，監工設計的人，也要跟着他們的工程而進行。今天在這裹，明天父到那裏了，他們住居的地方，不能一定。在從前那些辦理工程的人，都是就地建築那種粗造的屋，工程一完，便拆除了。但終覺得固定而呆笨，有了那種活動家庭的車子，只要有路可通，今天開到這裏，明天開到那裹，豈不便當？至於硏究學問的人，現在有許多學問，不是關閉在斗室之中，冥思默想，可以發明的，一定要到各處去探索，去追尋，甚而至於到人跡不到之處。你們中國人說的「結廬無人境」，有了那種車子，不能說於學問上沒有益處。』（九五）</p>

<h3>「歷代書畫展」幕後的幾名話</h3>
<p>— 徐邦達</p>
<p>「歷代書畫展覽會」最初發起人，是丁惠康吳湖帆劉海粟三位先生，牠的用意和目的，諸位諒來多早已知曉，關於出品，收集，和陳列方面，筆者耍向熱心贊助，和踴躍參觀的諸位先生們，來宣佈一下。這次担任着陳列工作的，除我以外，還有一位潘傳山先生，潘先生是一位博通藝文的學者，並且是收藏家，也是書畫家，所以這次的會塲佈置，實在得力於潘先生的功勞不小，還有孫伯淵，曹友卿，項樹德，吳賓臣璧城昆仲諸位，共同奔走着，我不過追隨襄助罷了。這次微求出品，是由本會幾位常務委員分頭向自己的友朋去接洽，而沒有公開微求，那知道收集後的結果，出乎意料之外，一共竟有四百多件，可見諸位收藏家是怎樣的熱心贊助，眞使人萬分感激的。然而塲子總是欠大，不能一次陳列完，這是無可奈何事。</p>
<p>第一次陳列，共是一百三十三件，展覽了五天，到第二次掉換，因爲元人畫珍品比較少一些，所以就多保留了幾幅，明淸以下，除了幾件很重要而出品中沒有重複的，只可以剩留以外，其餘十分之九，多掉了新的。這樣又增加了近一百幅；然而剩下來的依舊還有一百幾十件，本來是想只掉一次的，這樣看來是不成了，所以在十九夜常委聚餐席上，公議二十三晚上，再全掉一次。這樣一來，方始可以把收到的全部出品，一覽無遺了。不過因爲日子太緊促，只得陳列二天，只是萬分抱歉的。</p>
<p>至於懸掛的前後，完全以會塲的需要，和容納爲標準，第一次，二次，三次，完全沒有成見的分別，總以悉數掛完爲止。</p>
<p>這次出品的保獲，我們以爲是十分周密，在會塲，掛幅有木欄竿隔離；卷册有玻璃櫃籠蓋，當然不致於損傷和沾汚；就是收下來的時候，也是每幅拂拭過，然後用牛皮紙每幅包着。好得帮忙的孫曹諸位，都是玩書畫的內家，卷舒多是十分熟手，決沒有屈斷或摺皺的危險，這是可以向諸位出品人吿慰的。</p>
<p>末了，我們還要聲明一句最要緊的話，就是這次陳列出品，是件到必掛，不加選擇的，其中眞贋美惡，那是要請諸位參觀的先生們，自己去分辨評判。因爲鄙人同潘先生二人，只有陳列的責任，而沒有審查的權柄呀。倘說以爲是好的多，那是最好，或者以爲不大滿意，那末化的一元門票，譬如算了救濟難胞的捐款，諸位先生，大槪是可以原諒罷。</p>
<h3>胡琴概論（下）</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>關於持術方面</p>
<p>胡琴的發音很暴用得好可以發生激昂之音。不過初學的，可以吵得人頭疼，要沒有三年五載的苦功，休想拉出一些動聽的聲音來。（這比不得VIOLIN，本身發音，已很優美。）這是第一重難關。而且各種手法，變化很多，關於右手拉放，要分得好。半弓，全弓，弓根，弓梢，結果均各不同。裏外絃要輕鬆，活動。有短擦和抖弓。（和VIOLIN的拋弓的聲音差不多。）還要外推裏帶，不許有一點粗糙的意思。這幾下，已經够瞧的了。關於左手，就是指法。先說按字，須要不輕，不重。同時要視弓子的分量來決定。手指要上下能活動。先輕後重，先重後輕。有時在弦上輕輕打一下，還有所謂哆囉者，與西樂的TRILL頗相像。但是在胡琴上應用得很多，有時要明顯，有時要若有若無。最麻煩的，在有些地方，加不上而偏要加，眞正受累無窮。以上種種，都是完美藝術的必要條件。雖如此說，也並不是個個人都能辦得到。如果用下把呢，更爲費事。非有精妙的手法，靈敏的耳音，（即聽覺）和鎭靜的態度，不能達圓滿的結果。初練時，宜採用孫佐臣的點子，因爲他的還簡單些，如有幾個月的功夫，也能將就了。胡琴擱在腿上，而本身太輕，在用下把時，頗有站立不穩之勢，故練下把先要使它穩住，要不然，便不能表演了。此外尙有塲面的熟練。凡是一齣戲都有一定的順序，在事前應當有充分的熟憶，否則一上台便楞住了，內行謂之黑塲子。塲子旣熟，那末快慢節奏，也是個大問題。同時要與唱者，塲面兩相吻合。不能單就自己的主觀意思胡來，那是要失敗的。至於最重要的，是要腔熟。生，旦，凈，來，一行有一行的特點。同時老生，而戲有不同。戲雖同，而唱法不一樣。這種地方，都是學胡琴的人，必要通過的境界。要淵博而精通，切不存馬馬虎虎的念頭。要從好裏再好，才能精。精中求精，乃能化。往往有些人看不起胡琴，我敢斷定他決不會拉，就會拉，也不過是一個很幼稚的。幼稚的人，當然說出來的話也是盲目批評了。如果人人全都有這個思想，那末藝術便不能進步了。胡琴的音色，實在很好，小小的東西，發音如此偉大。不過音位太少，倘有人專門潛心硏究起來，當然更有許多的變化，可以生化出來。倘因爲簡單而不加硏究，憑空說胡琴沒有價値，那是他自己思想太簡的緣故。試看現在西洋音樂中的鋼琴和小提琴，也是經過許多人的努力，纔有今日的地位。要是當初沒有人改良，那末現在還不是一個音樂的玩具而已。</p>

<h3>小型劇塲人物誌（上）</h3>
<p>— 曼伏</p>
<p>前言</p>
<p>海上戲劇界，已趨入「復古」之途，例如黃金，卡爾登，卡德的專演老戲，就是一個明證。本來，上海的戲院，從前呌茶園，現在幾家茶園的樓上，晚上也演起戲來，爲了工部局的照會關係，在正劇未上之前，來幾個「倡門中人」淸唱一番，等待正戲上塲，美其名曰「彩排」。早就恢復三十年前「茶園」的舊觀，可是現在處處講求摩登，茶園也就被人稱爲「小型劇塲」了。環顧海上之「小型劇塲」，亦惟「小廣寒」「長樂」「時代」三家，票價最高一律三角，鄙人每晚聽歌，聞見所及，爰作「小型劇塲人物誌」，但已脫離者不錄。</p>
<p>小廣寒之部</p>
<p>小廣寒爲海上「小型劇塲」第一家，因營業獲利，遂有長樂時代繼起，而長樂時代之角，幾無一非小廣寒出身也，茲先述小廣寒。</p>
<p>姜小樓，汪笑峯，皆坤角老生，唱做兼擅，戲路相同，該塲不惜工本，竟用雙料角兒，姜在兩伶，在杭嘉湖水路班，皆係懸正牌之當家角兒，且擅小本戲，如「生死板」「鼎盛春秋」「一棒雪」「楚漢英雄傳」等，爲坤角鬚生中所僅見。</p>
<p>劉琴心，係劉玉琴之徒，以花旦戲稱擅長，如「戰宛城」「翠屏山」「潘金蓮」一路戲，演來絲毫不苟？皆劉玉琴所親炙，琴心係本報「故都宮闈梨園秘史」作者徐慕雲先生寄女。</p>
<p>小王虎辰，爲坤角武生，乃老伶工樊春樓之姪女，樊春山之掌珠也，曾從王虎辰習藝，故名，扮相英俊，開打火熾，爲坤角武生中後起之秀。</p>
<p>周碧雲，係朱東梅之鳳儀坤班出身，初向王子玉習戲，久隸永安天韻樓，演花旦，以風騷戲聞於時，「打花鼓」「變搖會」頗可觀，飾貌甚妍，作工細膩，惜唱工不乾凈，不及念白之流利動聽。</p>
<p>吳桂芬，爲後臺絆理，臺上角兒缺，後臺經理湊，吳本屬名伶，與小達子齊名，什麼戲都唱，乃小廣寒少小得的人物。</p>
<p>蘇韻秋，吳桂芬之女，花旦戲不及靑衣戲，小姑居處猶無郞，因何姓蘇未詳，嗓音做工均佳，惜拙於扮相，未能唱紅，即十餘年前在神仙世界先施樂園，得盛譽之吳翠雲也。</p>

<h3>金陵地震</h3>
<p>（見遜淸同治十一年四月份本報）</p>
<p>前日友人談稱金陵地震，疑爲　語，不之信也。今有自金陵來者，余急詢之，乃知實於前日黃昏時分，地震一飯頃許，屋字幾傾，船中欹側茗椀，間有碎者。聞自鎭江至蕪湖，上下數百里間，同時地震，而蘇松殊不覺也。說者謂地氣不和則震動，蓋無關休咎云。</p>
<h3>水面蟠龍</h3>
<p>前日夜間九時半鐘時，有西人行經大橋，見橋上人極擁擠，皆身倚橋柱而俯首下窺，若有所伺者然。西人不解所謂，牽一老翁之裾而問之，翁曰：「橋下神龍出現矣！身若巨蛇，盤縛不動，蓋以未得風雷之助耳。」此時也，月色空明，波光澄澈，西人望之，殊無所見；則因其肩背壓疊，以至遮隔眼界。正疑怪間，又來一華人，知其原委，亦欲窮其究竟。遂僱一小舢板船，共撑之橋下看之，遙見黑影一　，亦不辦爲頭爲尾，更無倫爲蛇爲龍矣。彼等必欲迫視，並取撑船長竿，銜以利刃，而從旁逆刺；橋上人見之，齊聲大譁，以爲觸犯神龍，斷乎不可。彼等不聽，縱臂一揮，刃已刺入，而應手無聲，此物亦毫無動靜。橋上人復大聲譁噪擾攘，以爲渠苟掉尾鼓　，翻波作浪，則吾輩無噍類矣。嗣徐徐移舟至其旁，將其物以竿挑起而審視之，則固腐爛竹簍，筒以篾席，而叉有斷巨粳在其旁，浮泛水中，結而爲一，月下遙望，故有似乎蟠龍也。審視旣眞，橋上之人，莫不哈哈大笑，自哂其眼光之誤也。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Around Linfen; Japanese Casualties Nearly 1,000; Railway Between Hongdong and Huoxian Completely Destroyed; Chinese Forces in Luohan Move to Yuanxigou to Meet the Enemy</h3>
<p>Xingji: At 2:00 PM on the 21st, eight or nine hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry, accompanied by six cannons, advanced west from Xinzhishitan ("south of Huoxian") and Zhao City in separate routes. A certain Chinese unit blocked the Japanese advance on the highlands east of Zhongcun. Fierce fighting continued until evening, when the Chinese army retreated slightly westward. On the morning of the 22nd, Chinese reinforcements arrived. One part launched a counter-attack from the front, while two parts of fresh troops combined forces to attack the flanks. After chaotic fighting until evening, the Japanese army was unable to hold out and fled eastward. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing over 200 Japanese soldiers and capturing many spoils of war. Over 200 Japanese troops between Hongdong and Zhao City advanced west through Dongchen Village on the 23rd and were dealt a head-on blow by the Chinese army, failing to succeed and retreating east. On the evening of the 20th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops in Shiai ("west of Linfen"). The Chinese army sneaked into the village and launched a fierce grenade attack. The Japanese troops were panicked and fled in all directions. The Chinese army pursued and killed many Japanese soldiers. Fierce battles have been fought in the Linfen area for over a dozen times in recent days, with nearly 1,000 Japanese casualties. On the morning of the 21st, over 60 Japanese vehicles carrying ammunition drove south from Linfen and returned in the afternoon, fully loaded with corpses. Also, on the night of the 19th, a certain Chinese unit crossed the river ("Fen River") to destroy the railway on the Zhao City-Yongle-Xiaohuma line. This was discovered by the Japanese army, and after several hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese army returned. On the morning of the 20th, over a hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry took the opportunity to advance on the Chinese positions at Lijicun and Haoyicun ("west of the Fen River") in separate routes. The Chinese army fought bravely, braving heavy Japanese artillery fire to approach the Beishiming line. Seeing that the Chinese army was irresistible, the Japanese troops turned back from Shizhuang and fled east across the river in disarray, suffering a heavy blow from the Chinese ambush. In the Fushan area, the Japanese army has repeatedly sent reinforcements and is currently fighting against the Chinese army in the northwest of Fushan. The railway bridges, culverts, and tunnels in the southern section of the Tongpu Railway have been severely damaged by the Chinese, especially between Hongdong and Huoxian, almost all of which have been destroyed and will take at least two months to repair. (Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Xingji: There have been continuous encounters in the western Fen River area. Beiwan and Wangyu and other places have been lost and regained repeatedly, and the fighting is particularly fierce. According to reports, at 5:00 AM on the 20th, over 300 Japanese troops advanced in two routes from Qiumu and Dongjialing ("northeast of Fenxi") to Luohan Tongwan. After three hours of fierce fighting, Luohan and Beiwan were occupied by the Japanese army. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the Chinese army launched a counter-attack and first recaptured Beiwan. The remaining Japanese troops fled to Luohan, and the Chinese army tightly surrounded the village, selecting a daring team to charge into the village. The Japanese troops stubbornly resisted from their fortifications. After a period of intense fighting, the Chinese army withdrew, having killed over 100 Japanese soldiers and captured one Japanese officer. Many members of the Chinese daring team also made heroic sacrifices. On the morning of the 21st, the Japanese army transferred over 700 reinforcements from the Nanguan ("north of Huoxian") area, accompanied by six cannons, and joined the Japanese troops in Luohan in a large-scale counter-attack, firing gas shells at the Chinese army. The Chinese army fought bravely and held on for six hours. When their ammunition ran out, they continued to charge at the Japanese army with flesh and blood, engaging in hand-to-hand combat four or five times. They have now moved to the Yuanxigou area to seek opportunities to attack. The Japanese troops that attacked Zhuyu briefly entered the village but were repelled by the Chinese army.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Aggression and Anti-Aggression</h3>
<p>A Reuters diplomatic reporter reported: "The heat of the international flames shows no signs of cooling." This sentence precisely summarizes the seriousness of the current international situation. Yes, history has reached a period of sudden change, and the world is in a vortex of re-division. Intimidation, shouting, roaring, wailing: mixed into a chaotic sound, blackmail, concessions, maneuvering, and scheming, interwoven into a bewildering picture.</p>
<p>However, in this complex situation, we also see the increasingly clear division of international fronts. On the one hand, the arrogance of the aggression front is increasing, and on the other hand, the democratic countries of the peace front are gradually solidifying. There is no third way. Even like British Prime Minister Chamberlain, although he has not yet given up the illusion of compromising with aggressors, objective circumstances are finally forcing him to organize an anti-aggression front, and to "shift the wine barrel and seek instruction," to win over the Soviet Union and connect small countries… In a word, he has to return to the road of collective security — of course, due to the consistent vacillation of the British attitude, there is still a considerable distance from the realization of collective security.</p>
<p>Recent international developments all demonstrate the struggle between the two forces of aggression and anti-aggression. President Roosevelt's warning to Germany and Italy, Hull's strong protest to Japan, and the return of the American fleet to the Pacific indicate that the United States, one of the pillars of the peace front, is providing great support to the collective security movement called for by Britain; the signing of the Anglo-Turkish agreement and the approaching Anglo-Soviet negotiations indicate that the collective security system is gradually evolving. The above factors can all be said to be clear evidence of the progress of the anti-aggression peace front. On the other hand, under the pressure of the peace front becoming increasingly solidified, the countries of the aggression front are also carrying out diplomatic offensives. First, Hitler tried every means to threaten and lure Britain to prevent her from approaching the Soviet Union; at the same time, he carried out large-scale diplomatic activities to try to win over Hungary and other small countries. Second, Italy also tried its best to collude with Yugoslavia and attempted to pull Yugoslavia out of the League of Nations and into the "Anti-Communist" Pact. Third, Japan, fearing that collective security would expand to the Far East, even instigated its government-controlled newspapers to carry out an anti-British movement to threaten and lure Britain, and to echo Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>From the above facts, it can be seen that as the aggression forces intensify their attacks, the anti-aggression forces are also developing step by step, and collective security is gradually evolving.</p>
<p>Peace is indivisible, and collective security cannot be limited to Europe, but must also extend to the Far East. Twenty-two months of resistance have proved that China is standing on the front line of anti-aggression and is a pillar of the peace front. She is fighting not only for her own survival, but also for world peace. China's resistance is completely in line with the interests of the countries of the peace front — Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, etc. It should receive the sympathy and assistance of all countries of the peace front!</p>
<h3>Red Star Newspaper Discusses the Victory of the Chinese Army's Counter-Offensive; The Chinese Army Has Gained the Initiative; High Fighting Power Inflicts Heavy Damage on the Japanese</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Red Star Newspaper commented on the recent Sino-Japanese war situation, saying, "After occupying Nanchang and Guling, Japan originally thought that the fighting power of the Chinese army would be hit and the anti-Japanese national united front would be shaken. However, subsequent facts have proved that the fighting power of the Chinese army has not only not weakened, but has even advanced to carry out active activities on a very long front. The fighting situation in the past ten days has proved that the Chinese army has gained the initiative on all fronts and has made considerable progress. As of April 20, the Japanese army has been forced to withdraw from more than 70 counties and towns."</p>
<p>"The active activities of the Chinese army have shown its high fighting power and the firmness of its moral and political will, proving that China is determined to resist to the end until it achieves final victory." The newspaper concluded, "We can now assert that the Japanese army has been defeated in several battlefields, and the situation of the Chinese army has improved a lot, and its high fighting power has also been demonstrated."

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Yunnan Through Annam; France Issues Warning</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) When Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed Mengzi, Yunnan, on the 13th of this month, the Euro-Asia Company's 19th squid postal aircraft happened to be attacked by Japanese aircraft in the air 10 kilometers east of Bac-Kan in Vietnam. It has been found that the Japanese aircraft took off from Tuanzhou Island in Tokyo Bay, intruded into French Indochina airspace after entering Guangxi's Zhennanguan, and flew directly into Yunnan Province, China, indiscriminately bombing Mengzi, where the Chinese side had no defenses. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believed that it was illegal for Japanese aircraft to invade the territory of Vietnam, a third country, to achieve the purpose of bombing Chinese cities, and immediately urged the French side to pay attention and take necessary steps to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents. It is reported that the French side is also deeply indignant at the Japanese aircraft's invasion of Vietnamese territory and has issued a warning to the Japanese side, prohibiting such transgressive actions from happening again.

<h3>Canadian Aid-China Committee Convenes Pacific Northwest Conference; Prohibition of Transporting Military Supplies to Japan; Chairman Chiang and His Wife Send Telegrams of Congratulations</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Vancouver Aid-China Committee and the Medical Supplies Donation Aid-China Committee in Canada specially convened the "Pacific Northwest Conference" there on the 22nd and 23rd of this month. Its purpose is to unite all circles in Washington, Canada, Columbia State, and Liler Bank (located on the Pacific coast, one of the northwestern states) to implement a movement to prohibit the transportation of military supplies from Pacific ports to Japan. Chairman Chiang and Madam Chiang specially sent a telegram to the conference to congratulate them. The telegram is translated as follows: "We hereby, on behalf of the Chinese nation, congratulate your conference and hope that the movement advocated by your conference to prohibit the transportation of military supplies from Pacific ports to Japan will be successful. If all democratic powers can decide on a policy sooner to deny the brutal acts of strong countries invading weak neighbors, then China will not be ravaged, the credibility of Western countries in Asia will not be overturned, the independent sovereignty of small countries in the Commonwealth will not be tragically deprived, and the world will not suffer such a disaster that threatens human safety as it does today. Aiding China and weakening Japan is also aiding democratic countries and maintaining their independence and peace. Conversely, continuing to aid Japan with military supplies, allowing it to use this to invade China, is tantamount to sowing the seeds of disaster everywhere in the world, allowing them to grow to destroy human freedom and culture."

<h3>Heavy Casualties Among Japanese Troops in Northern Hubei</h3>

<h3>Outline of Wartime Propaganda Made by the Military Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Wartime – "namely, Guerrilla Zone" – Outline of Propaganda, made and issued by the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, April of the 28th year of the Republic (1939).</p>
<p>The Importance of Propaganda</p>
<p>A. The necessity of wartime propaganda work lies in the second phase of the War of Resistance. Wartime political propaganda work is even more important than the frontline and the rear, for the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) In the vast areas "occupied" by the Japanese bandits, what the enemy can truly occupy are only a few large cities, a few transportation lines, and some military strongholds. The rest of the country is under our control. (Statistics on wartime county administration from the Executive Yuan in February of this year indicated that: (A) out of 941 counties in the war zones of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Fujian, Hubei, and Hunan provinces, only 55 county magistrates could not exercise their functions; (B) parts of 25 counties were occupied, but the county magistrates still resided in the county seats and exercised their functions; (C) the county seats of 245 counties had fallen, and the county magistrates had moved to the countryside to work; (D) 23 county magistrates had moved to neighboring counties but were still able to exercise their functions). At the same time, we have established many anti-Japanese base areas in these vast areas, left behind many regular troops, and organized many guerrilla forces, whose activities range from six or seven counties to dozens of counties. Therefore, the minister instructed our party and government personnel and revolutionary cadres, those in the enemy's rear areas, should remain in the enemy's rear. At the same time, the entire nation should regard the enemy's rear as an important target for our revolutionary work.</p>
<p>(2) The enemy's strategy of military aggression originally aimed to use military force as a means to achieve its goal of economic plunder. It also used politics as a means to cover up the facts of its military aggression. The enemy everywhere instigated Chinese traitors to establish puppet organizations, and at the same time used Chinese traitors to create various names of robber companies to carry out their plunder. This is a concrete manifestation of this conspiracy. In response to the enemy's secret conspiracy, we must use military force to cover the political offensive and use politics to assist military victory. To carry out this countermeasure, wartime political propaganda work needs to bear a greater task.</p>
<p>(3) In the second phase of the War of Resistance, the enemy's strategy of "quick victory" and the political strategy of "quick peace" have both failed. They are caught in a dilemma, unable to advance or retreat, and are in a desperate situation where their forces are insufficient and their finances are exhausted. They have to issue the mournful cries of "long-term war" and the slogan of "long-term construction." The so-called "long-term construction" is actually "long-term war," which is an attempt to use the manpower and material resources of our war zones as capital for further aggression against China. According to recent intelligence, the enemy is stepping up its assistance to the construction of the puppet "New China Government," (A) consolidating the occupied areas, actively reorganizing and cultivating vitality, and at a minimum must be able to supply the needs of the enemy's expeditionary forces in China; (B) extensively cultivating land in the areas of Dachang, Zhenru, and Nanxiang, and Jiangnan area, and moving Japanese people to cultivate it; (C) the enemy's "Sino-Japanese Cooperation" factories are subject to the control of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, in order to meet the needs of the long-term war against China, and to imitate the Soviet Union's Far Eastern Military District approach. We must strike at the enemy's delusion, first by ensuring that the enemy cannot plunder resources or train puppet troops in the war zones. This task largely falls on the shoulders of wartime political workers, who must extensively and deeply enter the enemy's rear, launch guerrilla warfare, consolidate revolutionary regimes in various places, destroy the enemy's transportation, and obstruct all of the enemy's political, economic, and cultural facilities, so that the enemy is exhausted and surrounded and beaten by our revolutionary forces, until they collapse (Minister Chen's words).</p>
<p>(4) The characteristic of the second phase of the War of Resistance is the transition from defense to offense and from defeat to victory. On the one hand, we must stop the enemy's advance, and on the other hand, we must prepare our total counter-offensive force to strive for final victory. Therefore, wartime political work must intensify the mobilization of the masses, develop guerrilla warfare, and contain and disperse the enemy's greater forces, so that they are unable and unwilling to boldly attack. At the same time, we must prepare more battle-experienced troops in the enemy's rear and unite more conscious people, so that they can be used to attack the enemy from both sides and cut off the enemy's retreat during the general counter-offensive in the future. (5) The war zone is in the enemy's rear, and can be threatened and attacked by the enemy at any time, and it is often difficult to obtain supplies from our rear. Therefore, we must intensify political propaganda work to raise the national consciousness and spirit of sacrifice of the wartime troops and people. We must "infinitely raise" the importance of political work in order to accomplish this sacred and great task. (To be continued tomorrow) (Dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<h3>Final News (Refer to Local News in This Edition)</h3>
<p>Last night, just after 9:00 p.m., there was a collision between a Japanese public bus and a private car near Broadway Road. It is now known that the private car was driven by Mr. Li Li, the principal of Lester Industrial School, with his wife sitting next to him, and Mr. Wimsett, a head constable of the Public Concession, sitting in the back. After the accident, an ambulance arrived and rushed the three to the Country Hospital. By the time they arrived at the hospital, Mr. Li Li had already died. His wife and the head constable were both seriously injured, but their lives were not in danger. It is said that Mr. Li Li was a Bachelor of Science from the University of London, a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and the Institution of Electrical Engineers, and one of the most famous educators in the Far East. He came to Shanghai in 1933 to work, and recently returned to China to hire a mathematics professor for the school. He stayed for two months and had just arrived in Shanghai yesterday on a certain postal ship when he suffered this tragedy. Everyone who heard about it lamented. The bad news was not told to his wife last night. It is said that after the Country Hospital admitted Mr. Li Li and the other two last night, an accident also occurred. A Japanese military officer, accompanied by two soldiers with rifles, arrived at the hospital and insisted on entering the room where the dead and wounded were placed to take a look. He spoke to Superintendent Samson in Japanese. Because Samson did not understand him, he did not answer immediately. The Japanese officer punched Samson below his right ear and pushed him out of the hospital. Samson did not argue with him. When he saw that the Japanese officer was threatening people again, he took the opportunity to leave the hospital and went to the Hongkou Police Station.</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Counter-Offensive by Germany and Italy, Striving to Alienate the Balkan Countries, Yugoslavia and Romania are Hesitating, Chamberlain Declares Britain is Negotiating with Russia and Turkey</h3>
<p>(London) Among the international situations, there are three matters that are most valued by the newspapers here, namely (1) the talks between Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and the British authorities; (2) the sudden return of British Ambassador to Germany Henderson; and (3) the diplomatic counter-offensive of the Berlin-Rome Axis. Regarding the first item, all newspapers said that if Britain does not provide Romania with economic assistance, it will not be able to resist Germany's eastward expansion policy. The Daily Telegraph reported that Britain should provide Romania with various conveniences in trade. This move is not only sufficient to directly assist the country, but also indirectly influence the policies of other countries in the Balkan Pact, namely Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Greece. These countries are in a difficult situation and are currently undecided. Their future choices depend on the results obtained by Foreign Minister Gafencu in London. Regarding the second item, although all newspapers have expressed surprise, the official has not made any explanation on this matter, so whether this move is appropriate is debated. However, the Financial Times reported, "The return of Ambassador Henderson should not be seen as any new development in the relationship between Britain and Germany, nor does he bear any new mission." Regarding the third item, the Manchester Guardian reported that the goal of Germany and Italy at the moment is to jointly control the Balkan Peninsula, and Yugoslavia is the first to bear the brunt, so they are luring and threatening these countries to maintain so-called neutrality, which is actually siding with the Rome-Berlin Axis, so that the axis countries' warships can use the ports of the southern countries, their army troops can use the railways of the southern countries, and their aircraft can use the airspace of the southern countries, that's all. "If the southern countries can obtain guarantees from other countries, they will naturally resist the harsh demands of Germany and Italy. It is a pity that Western European countries have never taken concrete action to strengthen the courage of the southern countries to resist, which has led to Germany and Italy taking whatever they want," he said. (Havas dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Axis powers are now preparing a second dose of inducement medicine to await the arrival of Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković. The Yugoslav Foreign Minister is scheduled to come here on April 26. Officials have high hopes for him. Germany's plan to increase the close relationship with the Balkan countries is now gradually adopting the form of "resisting the encirclement group." Political circles here believe that Hungary and Bulgaria can join the Axis side, while the southern country is still undecided, so special efforts are being made to win over the southern country. Roughly speaking, Germany will declare to Marković that Germany will give full assistance to Italy's Adriatic Sea interests. Germany may even raise the issue of the German minorities in Yugoslavia in the same form as Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic, so that the Yugoslav Foreign Minister is aware. According to the opinions of all sectors of Yugoslavs here, Marković will try his best to maintain neutrality and not be subject to any restrictions. (Reuter's dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<h3>Diplomacy Among Britain, France, and Germany Gradually Returns to Normal, British Ambassador to Germany Has Returned, French and German Envoys Will Follow Suit</h3>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned to his post in Berlin yesterday afternoon. Although people initially expected that the ambassador would not return before May, he suddenly returned immediately. According to well-informed sources, this has no political significance. It is heard that French Ambassador to Germany Coulondre will also return to his post from Paris in two or three days. (Reuter's dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson was summoned back to his country on March 19, that is, after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia. It has been more than a month. He returned to his post in Berlin at 2:00 p.m. today. A certain political figure commented that the British government has once again taken appeasement actions to prevent Germany from pulling back, and adopted a negotiating approach instead of intimidation. However, Britain's intensified expansion of its military and the organization of collective security to prevent aggression will not be relaxed in the slightest. This is what others say, that is, the recall of Ambassador Henderson in the past was to condemn Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Now that the government has decided to organize a peace group in Europe in order to solve the problem once and for all, then temporary measures such as recalling the ambassador are no longer necessary. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to opposition leader Attlee in the House of Commons today, that the return of British Ambassador Henderson has no special significance. The ambassador was recently summoned back to the country to report on his work. After the matter was completed, he asked for a short leave. After the leave expired, he returned to his post as usual. Attlee continued to ask whether the ambassador's return meant that the government had recognized Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. The Prime Minister replied that there was definitely no such intention, and there was no reason for it. (Reuter's dispatch from the 24th)</p>

<h3>Britain Implements the Conscription Issue, France Urges Strongly</h3>
<p>(London) The conscription issue seems to be presented at the cabinet meeting tomorrow, at which time a memorandum on this matter will be distributed to the cabinet members, but there is no hope of an immediate decision. The cabinet will also listen to Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon's budget tomorrow. Regarding this matter, people are afraid that income tax will be increased. (Reuter's dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of whether Britain should implement a conscription system, the government should make a decision in a short period of time. The newspapers have been commenting on this matter. Among them, The Times reported, "Most cabinet members admit that if Britain can establish the principle of compulsory military service, it will be more powerful in organizing an anti-aggression group. This view is not only in the cabinet, but also in general public opinion." The Financial Times reported, "When the cabinet meets today, in addition to discussing the budget for the next year, it will also discuss the conscription system based on the report submitted by Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha. It is heard that the Secretary of State for War has already drafted a plan to fully implement national compulsory military training." (Havas dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Conservative right-wing leader Churchill recently gave a speech at the London City Hall, advocating that the current national voluntary service system should be changed to a compulsory system. The audience applauded in agreement. Churchill said, "Domestic public opinion is increasingly in favor of implementing compulsory service, which is a phenomenon that can be seen. Therefore, this system can be seen in practice in a short period of time. As far as I know, the personnel of each department required for the voluntary service system have been filled, and the second batch of personnel has begun training. Considering the complexity of the current system, it is not bad to achieve such results." At this point, Britain has accepted the constraints from a certain country in Europe. "Since Britain has offered promises, it should train a strong army as a backing." But the thinness of the current strength of the army is laughed at by the enemy and chills the hearts of relatives, and it also delays the progress of the organization of a group of peace-loving countries because of this concern. It is necessary to know that the collective military strength of each country is the greatest guarantee of peace. If this group cannot be established in one day, the foundation of peace will not be laid in one day." (Havas dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Ambassador to France Phipps met with the French Prime Minister this morning, and visited French Foreign Minister Bonnet in the afternoon. According to The Times, this is related to Britain's implementation of the conscription system. British Prime Minister Chamberlain has now realized that he must change his original means. Based on experience, he has expressed that he does not have the strength to negotiate on an equal footing, because engaging in peace and engaging in war are no different. The great powers must have sufficient strength to implement their policies. (Reuter's dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Naval Exercises in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>(London) The London newspapers this morning reported that the British Mediterranean Fleet will sail from Malta on the 26th to the Eastern Mediterranean for exercises. A total of thirty-two ships will participate in the exercises, including one 30,600-ton battleship and two 31,000-ton battleships. The fleet is commanded by Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham. The official calls this exercise a "legitimate special cruise." (Haitong dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<h3>German Newspaper Reveals Hitler's Attitude, Claiming to Have Broken Through the Policy of Encirclement</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Fuehrer Hitler is scheduled to give a speech in the Reichstag on the 28th of this month, responding to US President Roosevelt. But the Danziger Vorposten recently published an article, commenting on it, saying, "The mediation attempt made by a certain overseas country is actually to accuse our country of being the first aggressor when war breaks out in the future. The German side should resolutely reject this despicable strategy. It can be asserted that Fuehrer Hitler should also formally tell the Western European democracies that peace is not an empty formula, but a vigorous undertaking. It is necessary to gradually find fair solutions to various problems. Our country is a powerful country based on racism, and its position is clear and it will never retreat one step, but it also has no delusion of pursuing an adventurous policy. In addition, since a delegation from Turkey recently came here to congratulate Fuehrer Hitler and took the opportunity to hold talks with Fuehrer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, the friendship between the two sides has been confirmed. The German government's appointment of Papen as ambassador to Turkey is also an excellent proof." (Havas dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the anti-aggression group, the talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have been commented on by newspapers here, all of which have taken the opportunity to attack Bolshevism, and predict that Fuehrer Hitler will give a speech in the Reichstag on the 28th of this month to respond to US President Roosevelt, and will develop the answers from the various small countries that have been obtained, that is, each country has not been threatened by Germany. It is said among political figures that "the struggle has begun." Even if the Berlin-Rome Axis' attempt to divide the Balkan Pact countries has not been as successful as expected, but seeing politicians from these countries visiting Berlin one after another, it is clear that Germany has won a victory over the "encirclement policy" pursued by Britain.

<h3>Romanian Foreign Minister Begins Talks with Britain, Germany Prepares to Guarantee Romania's Security to Prevent Joining Anti-Aggression Bloc</h3>
<p>(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu began talks with British authorities today. He met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax in the morning and with Prime Minister Chamberlain at the British Parliament in the afternoon. The Romanian Foreign Minister was accompanied by two secretaries, but no commercial experts. Commercial discussions between Britain and Romania will begin on April 25 in the Romanian capital. The British Lees-Ross Commission is expected to arrive in the Romanian capital today. It is not yet known whether Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu will speak with British businessman Stanley. The date of the formal meeting has not yet been decided. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, after discussing matters with the Romanian Ambassador to France, Titulescu, in Paris last night, arrived here at 5:20 PM today. He was greeted at Folkestone by the Romanian Minister to Britain, Tilea. British Foreign Secretary Halifax also welcomed him at the station. The Polish and Turkish Ambassadors, the Greek Minister, and staff from the Romanian Embassy in Britain were also present. Gafencu will meet with the British Foreign Secretary tomorrow morning and with Prime Minister Chamberlain in the afternoon. It is expected that Gafencu will report on Romania's contacts with Turkey, Poland, and the Balkan countries, as well as Germany's attitude. Germany's theory is that Romania does not need to join the anti-aggression bloc because, after joining hands with the Soviet Union, Romania will fear the Soviet Union even more than Germany. Germany is now preparing to guarantee Romania's borders, just as Britain is doing, but on the condition that Romania does not enter into an agreement with Britain. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu is about to arrive here to conduct important talks with British authorities. Official circles here attach great importance to this move, believing that whether Romania will actually join the anti-aggression bloc initiated by Britain and France, or intensify its ties with the Rome-Berlin Axis countries, will be decided in these talks. Romania urgently needs to increase its export trade, so the crux of the issue lies in the economic sphere. It is reported that Britain intends to promote trade with Romania within the scope of the existing agreement. In other words, it intends to purchase food from Romania and sell it domestically produced munitions. The reason why Sir Lees-Ross, the government's economic advisor, is leading a delegation to the Romanian capital to conduct business talks is probably for this reason. According to Romanian sources here, whether British-Romanian business relations can develop is a matter of great urgency. Since Germany signed a supplementary commercial agreement with Romania, it has been actively engaged in economic activities in Romania. There are several facts to prove this: German and Romanian businessmen have recently jointly established a company with a capital of £3,000,000, intending to monopolize the grain trade produced in Romania; a German Ministry of Economy expert, Walter, is leading a number of German technicians to conduct inspections in the Romanian capital; German businessmen have recently purchased smaller oil mines owned by Romanian Jews, whose oil production accounts for about 13% of Romania's total oil production. Under these circumstances, observers believe that the British government should do everything possible to promote business relations with Romania, ensuring that the oil produced in the country does not come under German control. If the business talks between Britain and Romania can achieve initial success, the political talks between the two sides can also proceed smoothly. These political talks will cover the following areas: (1) Romania and the Soviet Union should adjust their relations in accordance with the anti-aggression bloc's program; (2) The Balkan Entente should be maintained and strengthened, and the attitude of Yugoslavia should also be discussed; (3) How should Romania and Poland respond if Hungary attacks Romania or Poland; (4) How to strengthen the relationship between Romania and Turkey, in other words, how Turkey can immediately provide assistance if Romania is invaded in the future. All these issues will be mentioned by Foreign Minister Gafencu during his talks with British authorities. In addition, Foreign Minister Gafencu will go to Paris afterwards to inform the French government of the results of the talks. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital: Since Italy has been striving to reconcile Yugoslavia with Hungary and Bulgaria, political figures here are extremely concerned. They believe that the Balkan Entente between Romania and Yugoslavia to counter Bulgaria's territorial claims, and the Little Entente with Yugoslavia to counter Hungary's territorial aspirations, will henceforth be meaningless. Since Italy's annexation of Albania, the pressure it has put on Yugoslavia has been more than the country can resist on its own, and it may lose its freedom of action. When Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, the Romanian government, fearing that Hungary would take the opportunity to attack, asked Yugoslavia what its attitude would be. At that time, the Yugoslav government did not give a clear answer. The recent rapprochement between Italy and Yugoslavia further confirms that Yugoslavia's attitude has changed. At this moment, although Turkey and Greece still maintain friendly relations with Romania, it is not enough to cope with the current threats. It is hoped that the Western European countries will intensify their efforts to counter Italy's activities and ensure that the Balkan Peninsula's "status quo" is respected, which would be fortunate for Romania.

<h3>Why Are the British Ambassadors to China and Japan in Shanghai? Discussed in the British House of Commons, Said to Be Comparing Records</h3>
<p>(London) Communist Member of Parliament Gallacher asked in the House of Commons today what British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and British Ambassador to China Kerr recently discussed when they met in Shanghai. Under-Secretary Butler replied that Craigie's trip to Shanghai was primarily to spend a short vacation and to take this opportunity to compare records of several matters of common concern with Ambassador Kerr. Sir Kerr is now proceeding to the location of the Chinese government in accordance with normal procedures to conduct official business. The meeting between the two ambassadors had no special significance. Gallacher continued, asking whether the Under-Secretary was prepared to express an opinion on assisting the heroic Chinese resistance. Butler replied that the government's general attitude on this matter was well known and did not need to be elaborated. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Manchester Aids China, Donating More Than Just Bandages</h3>
<p>(London) The Manchester China Relief Committee met today. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Quo Tai-chi delivered a speech, stating that within another year, regardless of whether there is an international war, there will be signs of a peaceful resolution to the Far East. There are four reasons for this: (1) European and American countries are now gradually resisting the fact of aggression. President Roosevelt's dispatch of the American fleet to the Pacific is one proof; (2) When Prime Minister Chamberlain initiates the organization of the anti-aggression bloc, he will not forget the promise to China; (3) The Japanese people are gradually becoming weary of war, but the Japanese warlords are still unwilling to give up their conspiracy to conquer China; (4) The Chinese people are continuing to redouble their efforts to resist. Thomson, Secretary of the British China Relief Fund, said that there are many wounded soldiers entering and leaving the battlefield. He had requested a donation of 50,000 field bandages by the end of April. Manchester donated 17,000 bandages, and now the full amount has been raised. He is now raising another 50,000 bandages.

<h3>The Tokyo Newspaper Attacks America, Saying the Fleet's Transfer to the Pacific Only Increases the Seriousness of the Situation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, the Hochi Shimbun warned the United States that the United States' transfer of its fleet to the Pacific was tantamount to interfering with Japan's plan to develop southwards. The newspaper also believed that the United States' move was a "threat to Japan." The newspaper said, "How much the United States attaches importance to Japan's southward policy and how much the United States hopes to prevent it has become very clear. But if the United States thinks that moving its fleet to the Pacific is enough to contain Japan's actions, it is a very wrong idea. Not only will this not ease the situation, but it will increase its seriousness. We deeply regret that the United States is gradually increasing its provocative actions." (Associated Press, 24th)</p>
<h3>Three Giants of the Japanese Financial World Oppose a Military Alliance with Germany and Italy, Advocate a Cautious Diplomatic Policy, and Friction Arises with Junior Military Officers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At present, the three financiers are the most powerful. All three hold positions in the current cabinet, but their close relationship with the Emperor is closer than that of any behind-the-scenes faction. Who are these three people? (1) Shigebin Ikeda, who studied economics in the United States, once served as the Governor of the Bank of Japan and the Minister of Finance, and has close ties with Mitsui; (2) Yūki Toyotarō, who also studied economics in the United States, is the current Governor of the Bank of Japan; (3) Gō Seinosuke, who studied economics in Europe and the United States, previously served as the President of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and has close ties with Mitsubishi, and is currently the Chairman of the Japan Economic Federation. These three people have a controlling influence on the Hiranuma Cabinet. If the Hiranuma Cabinet exists for a day, they will be able to use their power to keep it on a cautious track. The Japanese military is naturally very unhappy with the policy of financial control. Junior military officers who are ignorant of economics believe that as long as public bonds are continuously issued, there will be no problems with the war against China, so they all oppose these financiers. As for older and more cautious military officers, they know that their grasp of victory in the war is extremely limited, so they can only accept the control of these three people. All three financiers have been educated in Europe and the United States, and their background in this regard has a great relationship with their thoughts and views. The reason why they oppose the military alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy may be due to their educational background. Minister of the Imperial Household Yuasa Kurahei deeply sympathizes with the three's view that they should not collude with totalitarian countries, but should maintain considerable cooperation with Britain and the United States. At the same time, all three firmly believe that Japan should conserve its national strength and adopt a more cautious policy internationally. According to sources here, the current Minister of the Army Itagaki is now regarded in the army as a cautious faction rather than a reckless and radical one. What is most surprising is that Araki, who in 1932 advocated that "the spirit of Japan should be expanded to the five continents and seven oceans, even resorting to force if necessary," now also opposes joining the anti-democratic military group. At least junior military officers are still plotting to overthrow the "liberals" in the conservative army, and many have been squeezed to unimportant positions. At the same time, there are many who have been promoted to important positions by them. Koiso Kuniaki's appointment as the current Minister of Colonial Affairs is the power of the junior faction, and was once regarded as a victory for the junior faction. However, according to news obtained by the Associated Press, Koiso's ideas are actually the same as Ugaki's. When Ugaki was Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was dismissed from his post by the military for attempting to maintain a cooperative attitude with third countries, because the power of the Japanese military was stronger at that time than it is now. It is said that Koiso also opposes joining the anti-democratic military front of European dictatorships. As for other political leaders, many also believe that "strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact" should be limited to the exchange of arms manufacturing and trade, and should not involve military aspects.

<h3>America's Silver Purchase Policy is Beneficial to China, the Time Limit Will Be Extended</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency's New York Air Communication: The current American silver law will expire on June 30 this year, and Congress may slightly amend it and extend its validity. Since the implementation of the silver purchase policy on July 1, 1934, it has been quite unfavorable to China's monetary system. Until the beginning of November 1935, the Chinese government lowered the value of its currency, nationalized silver, and entered into an agreement with the United States to exchange it for gold and store it in the United States. After this agreement expired, Chen Guangfu, a Chinese banker, recently renewed it with the American financial authorities, so that he could continue to exchange silver for gold to purchase the goods necessary for China's survival. This shows that the silver purchase policy in its current form is extremely beneficial to China. If it is amended, it will inevitably have a direct impact on China, and Japan, which has sold large quantities of silver to the United States in the past four years, will also be affected. Whether the American silver purchase policy is beneficial is a question that is often discussed. For example, Townsend, a Republican senator from Delaware, submitted a draft resolution to the Senate at the beginning of this session of Congress, stating that the silver purchase law is not very beneficial and whether its validity should be extended should be investigated by Congress. This proves that there are quite a few people who oppose this policy.</p>
<p>From July 1, 1934, to June 30, 1938, the US government purchased a total of 1,712,093,266 ounces of silver in accordance with the silver purchase law, of which only 13%, or 219,353,029 ounces, was produced domestically. From July 1, 1938, to December 31, it purchased another 200,000,000 ounces. It is generally estimated that about 1,650,000,000 ounces came from abroad, part of which was transshipped to the United States from London. The exact source is not easy to verify, but it can be asserted that the vast majority came from China and Japan in the Far East (including the occupied areas of China). Although Japan's silver production is not very high, it has benefited greatly from the US silver purchase policy. Its output in 1933 was only 5,967,000 ounces, but last year it increased to 10,000,000 ounces. As for its silver exports, in 1933 it was only 7,682,248 ounces, but in 1935 it increased to 225,401,505 ounces. It is estimated that the silver that the country has found or seized in China and "Manchukuo" has been completely transported to the United States. In the future, if Japan can seize the remaining silver in China (estimated by American experts to be more than 2,000,000,000 ounces), it will definitely sell it in large quantities. Otherwise, China can still use its silver reserves to purchase munitions from the United States within the scope of the American silver purchase policy, according to the Sino-American gold and silver exchange agreement. The United States was originally a major exporter of silver, exporting 43,275,000 ounces in 1933. In 1935, one year after the implementation of the silver purchase law, it decreased to 5,279,468 ounces. In 1937, it decreased again to 2,093,435 ounces. During this period, China and India, which were originally major importers of silver, were transformed into exporters.</p>
<p>Critics of the current silver policy say that it has failed to make silver a monetary metal, but has instead deprived it of its monetary properties. Whether this move is wise is questionable. Countries have sold their silver reserves to the United States at low prices, and those who previously hoped that silver would become an important currency again have been disappointed. Those who support the current policy say that this policy is sufficient to raise prices, but in reality, its impact is very limited. To date, the amount of national currency spent by the United States on purchasing silver has been considerable, but the price level has only slightly increased compared to the early days of the silver policy. The silver law stipulates that the US paper currency reserve should reach a ratio of three parts gold to one part silver. When it began to be implemented in 1934, the government should have purchased 1,333,000,000 ounces of silver. As of today, the amount of gold held by the United States has greatly increased compared to four and a half years ago. In addition to the silver already purchased, another 1,100,000,000 ounces must be purchased to meet the gold to silver ratio of three to one. Congress is strongly opposed to this. If an investigation is conducted in the future, the current policy may be changed.</p>
<h3>Grand Wedding of the Iranian Crown Prince and the Egyptian Princess</h3>
<p>Iranian Capital: The wedding of the Iranian Crown Prince and Egyptian Princess Fawzia is being celebrated here for four days, starting yesterday. Tuesday will be the most lively day. On that day, the Iranian King will give two specially built palaces to the couple. The palaces are made of high-priced stones and marble. One is for the personal residence of the bride. The Iranian and Egyptian flags and gorgeous lanterns are hung here, and triumphal arches are built, like a city in a fairyland. The buildings are decorated with noble Iranian carpets and tapestries. At night, the whole city is brightly lit, like daytime. A grand banquet was held in the palace last night. Among the distinguished guests were Earl of Athlone, aide-de-camp to King George VI of England. Today, boy and girl scouts will perform in front of the Iranian and Egyptian royal families. Tomorrow, the Speaker of Parliament will hold a tea party in the garden of the Parliament Building. In the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also host a banquet for guests. On Tuesday, the Egyptian Ambassador will host a banquet for Princess Fawzia, followed by a performance by the Iranian Air Force, followed by a review of the troops. A detachment of British naval soldiers will also participate, and then it will be followed by a horse race. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Five Ministers Convene a Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures to the European Situation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an official gazette published here last night, the Japanese "Five Ministers Emergency Meeting" yesterday had a very detailed discussion on the European situation and the attitude that Japan should adopt. Before the meeting, Minister of the Army Itagaki visited Prime Minister Hiranuma and had a long conversation. After the meeting, authoritative figures from the Army and Navy Departments held a meeting to discuss various issues related to the European situation. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<h3>The French Minister of Construction Visits Poland to Ease the Gap with Russia, the Commander-in-Chief of the Estonian Army Contacts the Polish Authorities and Returns Home</h3>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources here believe that French Minister of Construction Monzie's visit to Warsaw is a further step in French foreign policy, not only to enhance political relations between the two countries, but also to strengthen economic links. Foreign Minister Bonnet's conversation with Polish Ambassador Lukasiewicz this morning also has the same significance. Political figures say that Monzie is a friend of Polish Foreign Minister Beck, and this personal visit will try to resolve Poland's prejudice against participating in the Anglo-Soviet Sky Agreement. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The city of Katowice in the Silesian province of Poland is a coal-producing area and a metallurgical center. A French-Polish joint venture company began constructing a railway eight years ago, from that place to the port of Gdynia on the Baltic Sea. From south to north, passing through eastern Poland, it can directly transport coal and iron ore produced in the Silesian province to the coast, without having to go through the Free City of Danzig. The last section of the route (belonging to the Polish government and operated by a French-Polish joint venture company) has been completed. Recently, French Minister of Public Works Termonzie and Polish Minister of Transport Ulrych jointly presided over the opening ceremony. Ulrych delivered a speech, stating that the economic cooperation between France and Poland has always been close, and will be further enhanced in the future. Termonzie then delivered a speech, saying, "I came to your country this time not to give any advice, let alone to engage in agitation, but there is something I cannot help but say, that France is located on the side of your country, so it is today, and so it will be tomorrow. The two countries are interdependent and no one can provoke discord between them." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: General Laidoner, Commander-in-Chief of the Estonian Army, has been visiting Poland for a week and has recently returned home. Before leaving, he gave a speech to the Polish newspapers, saying that after talking with General Smigly-Rydz, Director of Military Education of the Polish Army, and Colonel Beck, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, he saw the closeness of the relations between the two countries, because "both countries are in danger and are interdependent. There is no need to establish an agreement in words or in writing to express this form of interdependence." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Yugoslavia Negotiate and Establish a New Agreement</h3>
<p>(London) According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, London regards the communiqué of the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković in Venice as another sign of progress in the friendship between Italy and Yugoslavia. According to the opinions of foreign observers, Yugoslavia believes that the pressure from the Rome-Berlin Axis is more powerful than the guarantees of countries that are further away. Italy also has interests in the Adriatic Sea, so it has to maintain a friendly attitude towards it, but the Yugoslav people all hate Germany and Italy. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Italy and Yugoslavia did not sign any new agreement in the talks held in Venice this time, which is of great interest here. It is generally believed that Yugoslavia is still hesitant to accept the guarantees of the Berlin-Rome Axis. It is said that this guarantee includes the withdrawal of Hungary's demands on Yugoslavia. If Yugoslavia accepts Italy's proposal to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, reorganize its army under Italian-German supervision, and conclude a commercial agreement with Italy, then Italy originally guaranteed that Yugoslavia would not be invaded by Italy and Germany. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: After Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković held talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Venice, Italy yesterday, a communiqué was jointly issued, reiterating the friendship between the two countries and declaring that "the path to an understanding between the South and Hungary has been opened as a result of this conversation." Political figures here attach great importance to this and say that after Foreign Minister Marković and Foreign Minister Csáky of this country visit Germany in succession, the South-Hungarian governments can decide on various concrete measures to realize this understanding. Representatives may be sent to hold formal meetings. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3>International Anti-Aggression Games Correcting England, America, and France Chongqing Air Mail</h3>
<p>U.S. and Chinese Legislation No Different Than Aiding the Wicked British Prestige Declines Daily After German Annexation of Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>Thirty-One American Organizations Advocate Revising Neutrality Law</p>
<p>The Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League recently received an air message from the United States, detailing the attitude of the American public towards revising the Neutrality Act. Seven religious organizations, such as the World Alliance for International Friendship Through Churches, seven women's organizations, such as the Association of University Women, twelve labor organizations, such as the Iron Workers Committee, and five peace organizations, such as the National Council for Prevention of War, a total of thirty-one organizations, have all resolved to advocate revising the Neutrality Act. It is necessary to distinguish between aggressor and victim, and the embargo on arms and raw materials should only be applied to aggressor nations. Dr. Shotwell of Columbia University, speaking at Carnegie Hall in New York, criticized the Neutrality Act, saying that it not only failed to distinguish between aggressor and victim, but also often aided the wicked and hurt friends as a result. Bishop Oldham of Albany, at a speech organized by the National Council for Prevention of War, also believed that "the Neutrality Act is the result of the nervous breakdown or suspicion and fear of American political leaders of the past. In this era of increasingly close interdependence throughout the world, speaking of isolation is suspected of insincerity."</p>
<p>Sir Cecil Issues Declaration Against German Annexation of Czechoslovakia</p>
<p>According to the Chinese branch of the Anti-Aggression League, League President Sir Cecil recently issued a declaration on the Czech question. "The final destruction of Czechoslovakia has aroused praise from the German and Italian official newspapers, which see it as a natural result of the 'Munich' surrender. This time they are right. Due to the Munich Agreement, Czechoslovakia has been disarmed and is unable to defend itself. The loss of the remaining freedom of Czechoslovakia is only a matter of time. As Americans say, Bohemia has changed from a bastion of democracy to an outpost for Germany's renewed aggression. The question is, who is next? Perhaps it is the Netherlands, or Belgium, or Switzerland, or Romania, or perhaps Italy will demand its price in Tunis, Corsica, or Nice in the Mediterranean, or in Djibouti in the Red Sea, or in Spain. Unless all peace-loving countries are determined to work through the League of Nations to restore a strong international order, there is no way to prevent Europe from falling into international anarchy or the control of the Rome-Berlin Axis. This is an excellent opportunity for the national branches of the International Anti-Aggression Movement to urge their respective countries to take action. If France, the Soviet Union, and the British Empire declare their position based on this intention, then there will be no shortage of supporters and assistants, but they must act, and act quickly."</p>
<p>Sir Cecil's Words Unfortunately Prove True</p>
<p>In September of last year, on the eve of the Munich Agreement, Sir Cecil, President of the International Anti-Aggression League, wrote to the British Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post, arguing that British surrender to Germany could not guarantee Czechoslovakia would not suffer renewed aggression, and stated that the German government's guarantees were only a statement of intent at the time and would not be effective in the future. Half a year later, today, his words have unfortunately proven true. The Chinese branch of the Anti-Aggression League has selected and translated the original text as follows: "To the Editor: According to your newspaper's foreign affairs correspondent, the government has surrendered to Hitler. Your newspaper's foreign affairs correspondent has always been known for being well-informed.</p>
<p>According to the report, Mr. Hitler did not convince our government that his demands were just. He merely told Mr. Chamberlain that that was what he meant, and so our cabinet decided to surrender. Poland and Hungary will inevitably follow suit. What shall we do then? Some say that as a remedy, the integrity of the remaining territory of Czechoslovakia, which has been dismembered, should be protected. At present, France and the British Empire have guaranteed to him that 'in the event of foreign aggression, they will respect and maintain its political independence and territorial integrity.' But the question is, if the existing guarantee has been broken, how much strength can a new guarantee add?</p>
<p>It is not impossible for Germany to add its guarantee, but I cannot help but be skeptical, because according to several authorities, Czechoslovakia has been forced to abandon its alliance with France and the Soviet Union. In fact, even if Germany provides a guarantee, how much value would it have? There is no need to blame Germany for breaking its promises, because not only the National Socialist government, but all German governments since Frederick the Great have had a very clear attitude: for them, international guarantees are only a statement of intent at the time, and are not effective in the future.</p>
<p>Bethmann-Hollweg's famous theory of 'a scrap of paper' is not surprising. It is simply a brief explanation of the German point of view on this issue. Bülow's memorandum is worth our attention, because although he criticized Bethmann-Hollweg's statement at the time as foolish, he did not object to the content of the statement. The current German government has repeatedly expressed that they inherit the German traditional view of such matters.</p>
<p>Therefore, surrender to Hitler is equivalent to the elimination of Czech independence, and also equivalent to our betrayal of our treaty vows to Czechoslovakia. At the same time, it is also an acknowledgment of the rising prestige of the National Socialist government and the declining prestige of the British government. In short, it is an acknowledgment that violence is the only way to resolve international events, and an abandonment of the hope of replacing violence with reason and justice. —Cecil, September 20, 1938."</p>
<p>Presidents Song and Shao Express Opinions on U.S. Neutrality Law</p>
<p>Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi, presidents of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression League, recently believed that the new Neutrality Act proposed by Senator Pittman, chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had many inappropriate aspects. Therefore, they jointly telegraphed Henry Stimson, president of the Non-Participation in Aggression Committee in the United States, and Dr. Elisha, president of the Joint Committee for Peace, and Atkinson, president of the American branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement, to express their views. The translated text of the original telegram is as follows: "On behalf of Chinese public opinion, we hereby offer several suggestions, which we hope will be considered and adopted: (1) 'Neutrality' is only sufficient for smaller countries to use as a diplomatic convenience under special circumstances, and is not sufficient to become the national policy of a great power. (2) Morally speaking, there is no room for neutrality between justice and evil. (3) In terms of current U.S. politics, the evolution of the situation in the Pacific should also be considered in congressional legislation. (4) The 'cash and carry' method is sufficient to benefit belligerent countries with navies and transport ships. In the current Far East conflict, this belligerent country is the aggressor, Japan. On the contrary, this method is harmful to China, the victim of aggression, whose transportation is not perfect, and China is the one that the United States sympathizes with and is willing to help. Therefore, we ask you to use your authority to influence Congress, to educate the public, and to correct isolationism, so as to achieve the ideal that we desire. Both China and the United States will benefit from it. Respectfully, Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi, presidents of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement."</p>
<h3>Ningbo Waters Japanese Warships Roaming Intercepting and Searching Fishing Boats, Planning to Detain Italian Ships</h3>
<p>Ningbo Dispatch: At 9:40 AM on the 20th, in the waters off Hengshan Port, Yindong, a Japanese warship sailed from Tingshuimen, Zhenhai. The ship was No. 1 of the Fifth Fleet. It did not stop and immediately sailed into Xiangshan Port to the Hutou Ferry River surface under the jurisdiction of Fenghua County, lowered a speedboat, and searched passing civilian ships. Two fishing boats were seized until about 11:00 AM, when the warship retreated from Hutou Ferry and fired three shots between Hengshan Port and Hutou Ferry, with the shells landing on the beach. The warship then sailed northeastward outside Dongqimen.</p>
<p>The Italian merchant ship "Ende," with permission to load wheat to Ningbo, was sailing through Longshan waters under the jurisdiction of Zhenhai County at 1:30 PM on the 19th when it suddenly encountered a Japanese warship, which ordered the ship to sail with it using flags, intending to detain it. The Italian ship refused and replied with flags, saying that if they wanted to inspect, they could send someone over. The warship then lowered a speedboat, which approached the ship. A Japanese officer, looking at its insignia, seemed to be the ship's second mate, accompanied by a Taiwanese translator, boarded the ship for inspection. The ship's Italian first mate, Baiseli, received them. The Japanese officer accused the ship of being Chinese and intended to seize it. First Mate Baiseli explained that the ship had previously belonged to a Chinese merchant but had now been transferred to an Italian merchant, with a valid license from the Italian government. The Japanese officer could do nothing but inquire about the military situation of the Chinese side. First Mate Bai replied that he did not know. After two hours of entanglement, they left the ship.</p>
<h3>Su and Xi Counties Banning Rice Transport to Shanghai Puppet Provincial Government Asks Japanese Military Department to Implement</h3>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The puppet organizations of Wu County, Wuxi, Wujin, and Wujiang counties, due to the recent soaring rice prices and dwindling stocks, investigated and found that the rice was being transported to Shanghai for transshipment and export. The upstream provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, which are rice-producing areas, are also prohibited by the Japanese, making transportation impossible. In various county villages, guerrillas do not allow villagers to transport rice into the city for sale. The current rice price exceeds 13 yuan, but it is still difficult to stop the trend. The puppet provincial government has submitted a memorandum to the puppet "Renovation Government," requesting the Central China Japanese Military Department to immediately prohibit grain from being transported out of the territory. In the future, anyone must have a passport to purchase. The transport within the territory of Jiangsu Province should be given a transport permit by the place of origin, and the destination should be noted in the permit, and no detour is allowed, and no loading and exporting is allowed to prevent transshipment to Shanghai and leakage of exports. On the one hand, the Central China Japanese Military Department approved the opening of the rice ban in Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, or stipulated the quantity to be shipped out, allowing merchants in Jiangsu Province to purchase and transport to those places, but not to Shanghai. The above measures are being negotiated by the puppet "Ministry of Internal Affairs" and the Central China Japanese Military Department. If implemented, Shanghai rice merchants going to Su and Xi counties to purchase will have problems.</p>

<h3>Current Status of Secondary Education Nationwide 3,264 Schools with Over 600,000 Students Before the War Establishment of National Secondary Schools and Teacher Service Corps After the War</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Special Dispatch) The Ministry of Education recently compiled detailed statistics on the status of secondary education (including secondary schools, normal schools, and vocational schools) nationwide before and after the war. Excerpts are as follows:</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Wartime University Over 1,000 Students Register Xu Shaodi Hopes Zhejiang University Will Establish a Branch in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>(Yongkang Dispatch) Preparations for the establishment of Zhejiang Provincial Wartime University are underway. The sites for the College of Science and Engineering and the College of Agriculture have been surveyed. According to the registration results, over 1,000 students have volunteered to apply recently. The number of forms not yet received is not included. It is reported that among the 1,000 registrants, there are over 760 high school graduates planning to apply for the first year, and over 260 who have not taken the graduation exam and plan to apply after graduating this summer vacation. As for transfer students in the second and third grades, the number is not very large, and it may not be economical to open classes. The number of classes to be opened in each department will be decided after a meeting and then announced in the newspaper. According to Xu, Commissioner of Education and Director of the Preparatory Committee, the number of people that the wartime university can accommodate is limited. He hopes that National Zhejiang University can also set up a branch school in the province to recruit first-year freshmen, which will alleviate some of the difficulties in the education of young people in the province. He said that he felt the journey to Chongqing was difficult and arduous. Although national universities have joint recruitment, it is very difficult to go to Guizhou and Yunnan from Zhejiang. Therefore, young people in the province who are ambitious and capable of going to school will inevitably sacrifice opportunities due to transportation and economic difficulties. For the sake of cultivating talents for the country and meeting the needs, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has established the Wartime University. The cause of national construction is complex and has many aspects, and cultivating talents should be the top priority. Zhejiang Province has made many achievements during the Anti-Japanese War. This provincial university will not only be the highest institution of learning in eastern Zhejiang in the future, but also a memorial of deep and long-lasting significance in Zhejiang during the Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Christian Secondary Schools A Total of Twenty-Two Schools Over 6,000 Students</h3>
<p>There were originally seventeen Christian secondary schools in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the war, Christian schools in the Jinghang area were unable to open classes due to the fall of the war zone, and many moved to Shanghai to open schools independently or jointly. According to a survey, there are currently twenty-two Christian secondary schools within the two concessions. According to the reports of twenty-one schools, there are a total of 6,154 students. According to the reports of twenty schools, there are a total of 552 faculty and staff, of which six schools include the number of primary school teachers. The tuition fees are from 28 yuan to 60 yuan per semester for senior high school and from 18 yuan to 38 yuan for junior high school. In the first semester of the 28th year, the total income of twenty-one schools was 251,905 yuan. According to the reports of sixteen schools, there were 2,983 students who joined religious classes. According to the reports of twelve schools, there were 357 students who were baptized. According to the reports of six schools, there were 885 people who joined Sunday school. According to the reports of ten schools, there were 1,103 people who participated in Sunday worship. Also, according to the reports of eleven schools, there were 378 senior and junior high school graduates in the fall.</p>
<h3>Private Primary School Principals' Association Regular Meeting</h3>

<p>Wenzhou Temporarily Prohibits Navigation; Gaps in Blockade Line Not Closed; Oujiang Gun Battle Yesterday Sinks Japanese Boat; Strict Precautions in Eastern Zhejiang, Postal Service Suspended; Baobei Ship Damaged by Bombing While Docked in Wenzhou</p>
<p>After the Oujiang River in Wenzhou was closed to ships, navigation to all ports along the Zhejiang coast was cut off. The De Ping, Hai Fu, and Ha Na returned to Shanghai yesterday. The Mou Fu arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the Bao Li is expected to arrive this morning. The Portuguese ship Baobei was bombed in Wenzhou. Japanese warships shelled the Oujiang River again yesterday. Japanese planes flew over Wenzhou and dropped bombs yesterday. Postal services in eastern Zhejiang have been suspended. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporary Navigation Ban, Gap Not Plugged</p>
<p>The Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Headquarters has prohibited any ships from entering or leaving the Oujiang River in Wenzhou and ordered foreign ships docked in Wenzhou to leave before 5:00 PM on the 23rd. As of yesterday, no ships have been able to enter or leave the Oujiang River in Wenzhou. The rock barrier at the mouth of the Oujiang River has already been blockaded, but the gap in the blockade line has not yet been plugged. Underwater mines have been laid inside the Oujiang River, and defensive works have been built at Panshi, Huanghua, and other places, with heavy troops stationed to prevent the Japanese army from landing by stealth. The navigation ban is temporary in nature.</p>
<p>Mou Fu Arrives in Shanghai, Interview with Purser</p>
<p>The German Lihe Shipping Company's ship Mou Fu arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday from Wenzhou and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Purser Ji on board yesterday. According to the purser, the Mou Fu was notified by the Wenzhou authorities to leave Wenzhou and departed Wenzhou at 10:00 AM on the 23rd, carrying more than 300 passengers and cargo. When sailing out of the Huanghua area at the mouth of the Oujiang River, a Japanese vessel continuously shelled the shore. En route, three Japanese warships were seen, seemingly heading to Wenzhou. The ship finally arrived in Shanghai on the 24th.</p>
<p>Oujiang Gun Battle Sinks Japanese Boat</p>
<p>According to the ship Chang of Mou Fu ship, told the Modern News reporter, The Japanese warship parked outside the mouth of the Oujiang River suddenly opened fire and bombarded the Huanghua Customs fortress starting on the morning of the 22nd, and launched many speedboats, fully loaded with Japanese Navy personnel, attempting to land there under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese garrison calmly responded and did not return fire. When the Japanese speedboats approached, they launched a sudden and fierce machine gun barrage, immediately sinking four Japanese speedboats. All of the more than 70 Japanese soldiers on board were wiped out without a single survivor. The remaining Japanese speedboats retreated in disarray. Then, the fortress artillery fired back at the Japanese warship, launching a fierce gun battle. The Japanese could not hold out and retreated. The gun battle stopped at around 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Wenzhou Peaceful, Residents Evacuated</p>
<p>After Wenzhou was bombed by Japanese planes on the 20th of this month, the city residents evacuated to the countryside. Although the area is now peaceful, some shops have been forced to temporarily close due to evacuation. On the 22nd, three Japanese planes flew over Wenzhou and dropped bombs, with seven bombs landing in the city area. A pawnshop in Xiaonanmen was destroyed, killing more than a dozen citizens on the spot. At the time, the Mou Fu was docked at the Weili Han Wharf and became a temporary shelter after the air raid alarm sounded. Many nearby merchants and residents rushed to the ship for temporary shelter.</p>
<p>Baobei Hit by Bomb, Many Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Japanese planes dropped three bombs towards the riverbank, all of which landed in the Yongchuan Wharf area. One of the bombs landed next to the Portuguese Kang Sheng Company's Baobei ship. More than 20 sampans there were sunk, killing and injuring many people. As for the Baobei ship, it was hit by shrapnel, killing two people on board and injuring more than a dozen. However, the Yongchuan Wharf was not destroyed. The Mou Fu crew members were very panicked when they saw the Japanese planes dropping bombs because they were very close. The bomb that fell into the water had great force, and the Mou Fu suffered a huge shock.</p>
<p>De Ping, Hai Fu, Ha Na Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Italian Zhongyi Company's ship De Ping, the German Lihe Shipping Company's ship Hai Fu, and the German Far East Company's ship Ha Na all set sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning. En route, they received a telegram informing them that Wenzhou had banned navigation, so they temporarily turned back to Shanghai. The De Ping temporarily docked at Wusong and only entered the port yesterday afternoon, docking outside the French Concession. The Hai Fu and Ha Na returned to Shanghai yesterday and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. All passengers have disembarked, but the cargo on each ship has not been unloaded. The company plans to resume sailing to Wenzhou as soon as the situation in Wenzhou eases to avoid losses during unloading.</p>
<p>Bao Li Turns Back, Arrives in Shanghai This Morning</p>
<p>The Italian Yihua Shipping Company's ship Bao Li sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou. In the waters of Huang Zhong Island outside the mouth of Wenzhou, it was stopped by a Japanese warship. After sailing into the Oujiang River, it had to turn back to Shanghai the night before last at 8:00 PM due to the navigation ban in Wenzhou. The shipping company received a telegram from the shipowner yesterday stating that the ship would arrive in Shanghai at 9:00 AM this morning. All passengers and crew members are safe. Although the food supplies on board are limited, they will not run out. As for the German Lulin Shipping Company's ship Fei Kang, which is currently docked at the Roosevelt Wharf, it did not sail to Wenzhou the day before yesterday, and the rumor that it turned back is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Zhejiang Transportation Completely Cut Off</p>
<p>The navigable ports in eastern Zhejiang are Haimen, Ningbo, and Wenzhou. Now the Jiaojiang River in Haimen has been completely blockaded, the Yongjiang River in Ningbo has prohibited ships from entering or leaving, and Wenzhou has also banned navigation. Thus, transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang, as well as between Hong Kong and Zhejiang, has been completely cut off. The British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships sailing to eastern Zhejiang have all changed their routes. The Italian merchant ships, De Ping, Hai Fu, Fei Kang, Ha Na, and Mou Fu, have decided to temporarily dock in Shanghai. In addition, all Portuguese ships except those that have been detained, Shan Tai, Tang Sai, and Mei Fa, are also docked in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Five Portuguese and Greek Ships Detained in Wenzhou</p>
<p>After Wenzhou banned navigation, all foreign ships were ordered to leave Wenzhou, but the Portuguese Ming He, Xin De, Da Mao, and Baobei, as well as the Greek San Ma, are currently docked within the Wenzhou Oujiang River blockade line and are temporarily unable to sail out of the mouth of the Oujiang River. In addition, the German Lulin Shipping Company's ship Gao Deng and the German Far East Company's ship Tian Bao are currently docked in Dinghai, but the Tian Bao is temporarily sailing between Dinghai and Shenjiamen.</p>
<p>Coastal Areas Under Martial Law, Ende Stuck in Ningbo</p>
<p>In addition to the coastal ports in eastern Zhejiang banning navigation, solid defensive works have been built, and a large army has been stationed with strict precautions. The troops stationed in various places are ready to fight and will resolutely strike if the Japanese army attempts to land by stealth. As for the Italian Zhongyi Company's ship Ende, it was specially permitted to load wheat in Shanghai and arrive in Ningbo. After the cargo was unloaded, it was originally planned to sail to Shanghai immediately, but the authorities prohibited it from loading cargo, so it has been stuck in Ningbo until now. The company has now submitted a request to the Zhejiang military authorities to allow the ship to load cargo and return to Shanghai, which is still under consideration.</p>
<p>Postal Services in Eastern Zhejiang Have Been Suspended</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has suspended the acceptance of mail to eastern Zhejiang, such as Shaoxing, Yuyao, Jinhua, Lishui, Yongkang, Wenzhou, and other places, as well as all places along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, including ordinary, express, registered, large and small packages, and remittances, starting from 2:00 PM yesterday. A notice was issued stating: (1) The acceptance of large packages to all counties and cities in eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is suspended from today. This is hereby announced. (2) Individual packages containing packages and medicines will be temporarily suspended from the 24th of this month to eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.

<p>Chinese Army Intercepts Truck, Confiscates Japanese Yarn and Opium; Gonghe Transportation Company Truck Suddenly Intercepted at Baimaotang; Huge Amount of Japanese Yarn and Opium Destroyed</p>
<p>A truck belonging to the Gonghe Transportation Company was suddenly intercepted by the Chinese army at around 1:00 PM on the 23rd of this month near the 58th bridge on the Shanghai-Xihu Highway (near Baimaotang). There were more than ten pieces of Japanese yarn on the truck, worth four or five thousand yuan, which were burned on the spot. Opium worth more than 30,000 yuan was also found.

<h3>破壞抗戰侈方和平　汪精衛陰謀畢露　竟圖誣衊政府分人收買港滬新聞機關</h3>
<p>Undermining Resistance, Extravagantly Advocating Peace; Wang Jingwei's Conspiracy Fully Exposed; Attempts to Slander the Government and Buy Off News Agencies in Hong Kong and Shanghai</p>
<p>Since Japan began advocating the so-called establishment of a new order in East Asia, knowledgeable people have ignored it. The expected goal cannot be realized. Recently, Japan has again attempted to take advantage of the current international situation to instigate Wang Jingwei to launch a new situation and slander the Chinese government's internal figures sympathetic to Wang's absurd actions in order to create a false impression. Recently, people were sent to Hong Kong and Shanghai to buy newspapers and a small number of reporters, and to use the existing equipment of the China Daily to plan to establish the Minli Daily in Shanghai, which will be published soon. At the same time, the Republic of China News Agency is being prepared as its propaganda organ. The purpose is to intensify the propaganda that China is unable to resist Japan and to help Wang achieve his conspiracy to destroy China. However, this conspiracy has been discerned by all parties and will not succeed. Chen Xingmin, a lawyer in this city, has worked hard for social undertakings on weekdays and has won praise from all walks of life. Unfortunately, he was lured out and shot on the 7th of last month, resulting in serious injuries that have not yet healed. Recently, Mr. Chen read various newspapers and found that the Associated Press's telegram from Chongqing on the 21st reported that Wang Jingwei had bought the Huadong Printing Factory on Avener Road, reorganized the Xinhua Printing Factory, and undertook to print various publications advocating "peace." Chen was originally the perennial legal advisor of the factory and was sincerely afraid of misunderstandings. In order to protect himself, he has written to the factory, refusing to continue serving as the perennial legal advisor.</p>

<h3>英總領事館　對華字報態度　要求各報愼重紀載　並未發表禁載迷令</h3>
<p>British Consulate General's Attitude Towards Chinese Newspapers; Requests Newspapers to Record Cautiously; No Order Issued to Ban Articles</p>
<p>The English "Da Mei Evening News" reported that the Shanghai British Consulate authorities summoned the publishers of British-owned Chinese newspapers to the British Consulate General last Saturday and Sunday for a meeting to prevent these newspapers from publishing anti-Japanese and pro-National Government sentiments. It is heard that the consulate authorities did not issue an order banning articles, but made various requests. It is believed that this was done because the Japanese consulate authorities requested to suppress such news, hence this action. The main point of the Japanese opposition seems to be that these newspapers publish new Kuomintang notices on the spiritual mobilization movement. As for news obtained directly, the use of words such as "puppet" and "traitor" is not a problem if used in quotations, such as in telegrams of speeches by so-and-so. Examples of various terms used in British-owned Chinese newspapers were shown to the publishers. It is believed that after the publishers understood the points raised by the consulate staff, they may agree to no longer use the opposed words in the future, but they will argue that the freedom of the British press and the attempt to prohibit it are unconstitutional. It is also heard that the publishers asked the consulate staff whether they had taken any action to curb the anti-British sentiments expressed by Japanese-owned Chinese newspapers in this city.</p>
<h3>怡和紗廠工人　突遭日方逮捕　聽信工頭誣吿捕去七人　廠方交涉後五人已獲釋　工人行動已被監視</h3>
<p>EWO Textile Factory Workers Suddenly Arrested by Japanese; Seven Arrested on False Accusations by Foremen; Five Released After Factory Negotiations; Workers' Actions Being Monitored</p>
<p>The British EWO Textile Factory on Yangshupu Road has a long history. The factory originally had foremen and supervisors who were responsible for recommending workers and handling factory affairs, and the foremen and supervisors exploited the workers' interests and reaped huge profits every month. After the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle broke out, the factory, located in the war zone, was temporarily closed. After the National Army withdrew and Shanghai fell, the factory resumed work and abolished the names of foremen and supervisors, dismissing them. Unexpectedly, these foremen still gathered in the Yangshupu area, constantly seeking out male and female workers working in the factory, trying to disrupt the work. Because all the workers were not used by them, they could not achieve their goals, so they resented the workers and reported to the Japanese that there were workers in the factory participating in anti-Japanese work. When work was over, Japanese military police guarded the factory gate and escorted seven workers, who were identified by the foremen, to the Hongkou detention center.</p>

<p>Citizens' Group Fundraising Nears 300,000 Yuan; Each Fundraising Team Scheduled to Raise 100,000 Yuan This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens' Group Fundraising Committee is very active in carrying out fundraising work. As of recently, the amount of donations raised, collected and uncollected, is close to 300,000 yuan. The number of refugees sought for adoption has reached more than 13,000. As for the achievements of the association's fundraising teams, the last fourth payment has exceeded 90,000 yuan. It is now planned to raise 100,000 yuan before the end of this month. The association has sent letters to the leaders of each fundraising team yesterday, asking them to step up their work.</p>
<p>Two Workers Still in Danger</p>
<p>Since this incident occurred, all the workers have been uneasy and resentful of the Japanese's unwarranted arrest of workers, and demanded that the factory rescue them immediately. There was once a strike, but after the factory negotiated with the Japanese, five workers were released the day before yesterday. The Japanese believe that the remaining two workers are related to the terrorist case, so they are still detained. The factory is still negotiating, and at the same time, in order to protect the lives and safety of all workers, it has requested the concession authorities to assist in arresting the troublemaking foremen. At the same time, the Japanese have also sent three Japanese military police, ostensibly to protect the workers, but in reality to monitor the workers' actions.</p>
<p>Mutual Aid Association Asks Factory to Protect</p>
<p>All the male and female workers of the factory, in order to protect their lives and ensure the safety of the factory's work, have organized the EWO Textile Factory Workers' Mutual Aid Association. The original letter stated: "Greetings. It has been decades since your factory was established. In the past, workers were recommended to work in the factory by foremen. However, the titles of foremen and supervisors were all abolished the year before last. Fortunately, your factory sympathized with the workers' suffering. At that time, in addition to dismissing bad workers, the original workers were retained in the factory to avoid the impact of unemployment. As a result, these foremen and supervisors have repeatedly devised vicious schemes to prevent the workers from living and working in peace. Under this situation, the workers have flocked to the factory for a living. Unexpectedly, these unscrupulous elements have acted in a secretive and unscrupulous manner, falsely accusing the workers of illegal activities, resulting in the arrest of seven workers in your factory. The families of these workers have suffered unwarranted injustice and have appealed to your factory for proof. Now, we see your factory's notice stating that it has requested the Japanese military police to protect the workers' safety when they enter and leave the factory. Your factory's virtue of caring for the workers is truly admirable. However, when the workers go home after work, these unscrupulous elements will continue to cause accidents. The workers believe in the saying, 'You must not have the intention to harm others, but you must have the intention to guard against others.' Especially in this era, the workers should plan for the long-term benefit of your factory to avoid disasters for both sides. We have convened a meeting and resolved to specially invite Xu Yanlun, Liu Rongji, Cai Xin, Xu Guanche, Liu Renji, Tang Weisheng, He Ying, etc. as worker representatives to legally organize the EWO Textile Factory Workers' Mutual Aid Office. Internally, it is to ensure that the workers used by your factory will not have strikes or accidents in the future. Externally, it is to legally ensure that the workers will not be subjected to any injustice or accidental losses. For this reason, we have attached the draft charter and respectfully request your factory to review and approve it. We respectfully ask the general manager of your factory to quickly revise the charter and instruct us to comply with it. This is a win-win situation. To the General Manager of the EWO Textile Factory, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Museum Exhibition - Rare Animals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Museum, located at No. 20 Museum Road, was established in the thirteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1874) and has been in existence for over sixty years. Its collection is the richest in China, especially in the biological field, such as birds, beasts, fish, butterflies, reptiles, amphibians, and mollusks. They account for about seven or eight tenths of the exhibits. Rare and exotic birds and animals are displayed in a dazzling array. The arrangement method follows that of major British and American museums, using large glass cabinets and displaying them in a natural environment, making the viewer feel as if they are in the midst of a remote mountain forest. It is heard that the museum has recently acquired several kinds of rare animals, such as pandas, wild cattle, and sika deer. Mr. Tang, a technician at the museum, has carefully arranged them and will soon put them on display for public viewing. It is said that pandas are produced in the deep forests of the high mountains of western China. Bamboo shoots and bamboo leaves are their main food. Pandas are mostly timid, like to live alone, and are good at climbing trees. They are extremely difficult to catch. This spring, an American Mr. S. Secretes spent tens of thousands of dollars trying to capture several of them and send them to the United States by plane. They are very precious. It is said that this white panda was also a gift from Mr. Secretes.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties - Closing Today</h3>
<p>The sensationally popular Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting of Past Dynasties has, since establishing preferential admission policies for students, seen visits over the past two days from students of all levels from more than twenty schools, including Jiaotong University, Taicang and Zhenjiang Normal Schools, Yuqing, Guoguang, Zhengguang Middle Schools, Zhengxing, Peiming, Huaijiu, several Girls' Middle Schools, Suzhou Art College, Dongya Sports College, and Wuxi Chinese College. Most were led by teachers, who spoke and pointed at the famous works to arouse students' understanding of the legacy of their ancestors and their patriotic and love-for-hometown emotions. Therefore, the venue was almost like a lecture hall, and the atmosphere was very lively. The exhibition, which started on the 21st, has a duration of five days, and today is the last day. At 6 pm, this unprecedented grand event will be declared closed.</p>
<h3>National Flag Confiscated - French Consul-General Agreed to Return Today - Result of Taxpayers' Association's Repeated Negotiations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the French Concession interfering with the hanging of flags, after the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession negotiated a solution with the Chief Superintendent of the French Concession Police, although the arrested citizens have been released, the confiscated national flags have not yet been returned, which is of great concern to all circles. Merchants whose national flags were confiscated have repeatedly inquired with the Taxpayers' Association, requesting their prompt return. For this reason, the association conducted further negotiations yesterday. At 9:00 AM, Mr. Guo Shuliang, Secretary of the Association, first requested the return from the Lujiazui General Police Station, but the police station replied that it had not yet received orders from the French Consul-General. Mr. Qu Zhenhua, a member of the Association, then personally negotiated with the French Consulate-General at 10:30 AM. He was received by the French Vice-Consul Brot. Mr. Qu first stated that a solution had been negotiated with the Chief Superintendent of Police, that in addition to releasing the arrested persons, the confiscated national flags would be returned upon the Taxpayers' Association submitting a letter, and requested the French Consul-General to immediately instruct the police station so that the Taxpayers' Association could retrieve them and distribute them to the various shops. Brot replied that the French authorities had decided to return the national flags according to the previously negotiated solution and that there would be no changes. However, he feared that the procedures would not be completed today and that they could be handed over to the Association for distribution to the merchants by tomorrow morning.</p>

<h3>Import Surplus of Japanese Trade in the First Quarter of This Year - Increased by More Than 50 Million Yuan Compared to Last Year - Imports Mainly Raw Materials for Munitions - Exports Decreased by More Than 13 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that in the first quarter of this year, Japan's trade with countries outside the Yen Bloc saw a significant import surplus, totaling 199,737,000 Yen. During this period, Japan imported goods from countries outside the Yen Bloc, mostly raw materials for heavy industry, especially raw materials for manufacturing munitions under the current emergency situation. This point is generally considered quite important. Compared with the same period last year, exports decreased by 13,477,000 Yen, while imports increased by 57,309,000 Yen. This deserves attention because Japan's export of its products to foreign countries has become increasingly difficult during wartime. Light industry and small industry have always been the characteristics of Japan's manufacturing structure, and their exports account for a large part. However, due to the emergency of the war against China and the constant need to guard against any unexpected international events, light industry and small industry seem to be rapidly giving way, replaced by heavy industry, especially the munitions industry. Japan's exports are increasingly being channeled to the Northeast Provinces and North China within the so-called Yen area. However, it should be noted that Japan's exports to the Yen Bloc do not directly result in foreign currency earnings. Although Japan has obtained the raw material resources of the Northeast Provinces and North China, in the final analysis, Japan obtains most of these raw materials by exchanging them for Japanese goods imported into the same region.</p>
<h3>Workers from Local Newspapers Comfort the Lone Army</h3>
<p>Out of concern for the recent situation of the Lone Army on Jiaozhou Road, more than forty workers from local newspaper printing plants carried daily necessities (such as towels, soap, and toothpaste) to express their condolences yesterday afternoon, and presented a banner that reads "Adding Glory to the Country." These condolence gifts were all voluntarily donated by the workers of the various newspapers, with excellent results. During the visit to the camp, they were received by Company Commander Lei, who led them on a tour of the various departments and the ball court. Although Regiment Commander Xie was unable to receive them due to illness, he gave all the workers signed mementos. All the officers also wrote inscriptions to encourage them. All the workers were satisfied. Finally, they performed the play "Farewell."</p>
<h3>Grain Reserves Increasing Daily - Food Supply Not in Danger of Panic - Warm Weather Encourages Hoarders to Sell - Storing One Million Bags of Grain Can Be Realized</h3>
<p>The source of rice and grain in this city has been particularly congested in recent days. In addition, the weather is warm, and the grain accumulated by hoarders is gradually being sold off, so the market supply exceeds demand, and market prices are declining daily. According to reports from the Evaluation Association, the current grain reserves in Shanghai are increasing daily. In addition to the limited amount accumulated by civilians along the Yangtze River, the production areas not along the river still have abundant reserves. Now that the weather is turning warm, they are all rushing to transport and sell in Shanghai. According to the plan to store one million bags in the Shanghai market, it should not be difficult to achieve. In the future, even during the period between harvests, the food supply will not be affected in any way.</p>
<h3>Fengxian Situation Pacified - A Small Number of Unstable Troops Thoroughly Cleared - Garrison Guerrilla Team Issues Public Notice to Reassure the People</h3>
<p>The situation in Fengxian has been completely pacified. After the guerrilla team cleared a very small number of unstable troops, an unprecedented unity has been formed. The county seat of Fengxian is now guarded by another strong guerrilla team, which has issued a public notice to reassure the people. Order has been fully restored to its original state. After Li Zhiming resigned to take responsibility, past disputes will be handled by the Commissioner's Office. Furthermore, according to people from Nanhui, the news of Xu Xinzhou's murder has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>No Trace of the Japanese South of Duxing</p>
<p>The Nanhui puppet "army" has been under severe pressure from the guerrilla team in recent days and has completely withdrawn from the towns of Luhui and Zhaigang along the Lao Zhaigang River. Currently, only Dujiaxing still has a small number of troops entrenched. There is no trace of the Japanese puppets south of Dujiaxing. A portion of the civilian houses in Luhui Town was burned down by the puppet "army." Although the villagers have gradually returned, the scene after the disaster is extremely desolate. Currently, the guerrilla team is tracking and advancing north, and Dujiaxing will not be difficult to recover in one fell swoop. The situation in the areas of Xinchang and Hangtou south of Zhoupu is also very tense as the Nancheng guerrilla team prepares to advance west.</p>
<p>Family Members of Traitors in Xinchang Executed</p>
<p>According to people from Xinchang, Nanhui, Pudong, after the town was occupied by the Japanese puppet army, Tao Ruisheng was appointed as the puppet "Chairman of the Maintenance Association." A few days ago, Tao's niece went to the Zhongxinqiao area, twelve miles east of Xinchang, and was captured by the guerrilla team. The case was reported to the detachment leader for approval and executed by shooting, with her head displayed as a warning to those who act as lackeys for the enemy.</p>
<h3>Reorganization Plan for China Business Corporation - Letters Sent to All Creditors - Awaiting Judgment from the American Court</h3>
<p>The China Business Corporation, formerly in September 1935, petitioned the American Court of this city to appoint a custodian in accordance with bankruptcy laws. The court appointed Hu Xifu as custodian. On April 17 this year, Hu submitted a plan to the court to reorganize the company. All shareholders of the company and holders of the company's bonds were sent a copy of the plan on the same day. According to Hu, the reorganization plan submitted to the court last week described the past and present situation of the company, and listed the proposed reorganization terms one by one. When the company petitioned for the appointment of a custodian in September 1935, all mortgages and 8% bonds were unable to repay principal and interest. The reason was that the company's debtors mortgaged land to the company and failed to repay principal and interest. In September 1935, the Shanghai real estate industry was in extreme decline. Selling real estate would inevitably result in losses. At that time, selling the mortgaged land to debtors and creditors would result in significant losses. Since being appointed as custodian, in accordance with the court's instructions, he negotiated with the company's debtors to sell off their mortgaged land whenever there was an opportunity. At the same time, he negotiated with creditors to transfer securities at favorable prices to creditors. At that time, due to the sluggish market and the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the resolution between the company and its creditors and debtors took time. However, most of the company's debts and secured bonds have been paid off to creditors without loss, and the company has benefited greatly. Therefore, the company is now able to propose a plan to reorganize the company. The company currently owes mortgages, including 700,000 yuan for the first mortgage bonds at 7%, and also includes current account debts, totaling 4 million yuan. Hu, with the court's permission, negotiated with creditors to extend the repayment period for these debts to December 31, 1939, or after that date. The company's remaining debts, including principal and interest, are approximately 12 million yuan, of which 11.7 million yuan are for 8% bonds, and 300,000 yuan are owed to Madame Galing, all of whom are unsecured creditors. According to recent estimates, the company's assets are worth approximately 13 million yuan, 3.5 million yuan lower than recorded in the books. The company's total debts are approximately 16 million yuan, of which 4 million yuan are owed to secured creditors, and the remaining 12 million yuan are owed to holders of 8% bonds and Madame Galing. According to the proposed reorganization plan, all mortgage creditors can have their debts repaid by the company when they are due. Creditors of 7% bonds should receive all interest and one-fifth of the principal, and the remaining principal will be repaid in four installments, all within twelve months after the plan is approved by the court. As for the creditors of 8% bonds, Madame Galing, and shareholders of the company's common stock, their bonds will be canceled after the plan is approved by the court, and will be handled according to the following method: Creditors of 8% bonds and Madame Galing will be given newly issued common stock of the company equal to the face value and interest. Shareholders of the company's existing common stock will be given new common stock with a face value of 10 yuan for every 20 old shares, valued at 10 yuan per share. According to this calculation, approximately 12,250,000 yuan of new common stock will be issued, of which 98% will be given to creditors of 8% bonds and Madame Galing, and the remaining 2% will be given to the company's existing shareholders. After the reorganization, the company's position will be quite good. The company's debts to creditors of 7% bonds, such as mortgages, are approximately 3.5 million yuan, all of which are fully secured. In addition, the company also has unmortgaged real estate and other assets worth approximately 8 million yuan, which can be operated for profit. The company has now sent the plan to creditors with bonds and Madame Galing, and in accordance with the court's instructions, sent an acknowledgment form to be signed and returned to the American Court for judgment. The date of this plan is 10:00 AM on June 5.</p>
<h3>After Being Released by the Japanese, the New Haimen Arrives Safely in Shantou - Previously Forced to Sail to Taiwan - Said to Be a Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>The New Haimen, a British merchant ship of the Williamson Company, operating on the Hong Kong-Shantou-Fuzhou route, with a gross tonnage of 2,455 tons and a net tonnage of 1,571 tons, was detained by a Japanese warship while sailing from Fuzhou to Shantou, off the coast of Erge. Troops were sent to inspect it and forced it to sail to Taiwan. The shipowner urgently telegraphed British warships anchored in Fujian for assistance, and the Japanese side then agreed to release it. It arrived safely in Shantou on the 22nd of this month. It is heard that the Japanese detained the New Haimen by mistake, believing it to be a Chinese merchant ship, as there was a Chinese ship with the same name, New Haimen, in the past.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Beat Carpenter with Sticks - Seriously Injured and Unconscious - Life in Danger</h3>
<p>Cai Wenxing, a 27-year-old man from Ningbo, living at No. 30 Longqing Lane, Tilanqiao, Hongkou, was working as a carpenter. Yesterday afternoon, around 5:00 PM, he was repairing doors and windows in a Japanese military camp in Hongkou. Because he was working a little slowly and failed to satisfy the Japanese soldiers, the Japanese soldiers suddenly struck Cai's buttocks three times with wooden sticks. Cai was shocked and seriously injured, falling to the ground unconscious. He was later transported to Renji Hospital for treatment by another carpenter. Due to excessive shock, he was still unconscious after arriving at the hospital. According to the doctor's examination, he was seriously injured and his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang's Handwritten Instruction to All Agencies - Preferential Treatment for News Reporters - Assistance Should Be Given as Much as Possible in Their Work - The Greatest Convenience Should Be Granted in Transportation</h3>
<p>The provincial governments forwarded Chairman Chiang's handwritten instruction, which stated, in brief, that the suggestions from the Second National Political Council, establishing wartime news policies and promoting the development of the news industry, etc., including the third item, improving the work efficiency of news reporters, the government should give special preferential treatment to news reporters, and government agencies and military authorities should provide as much assistance as possible to news reporters in their work, and grant them the greatest convenience in transportation. This should be complied with.</p>
<h3>Japan Does Not Reply to Portuguese Consulate's Protest - Detained Portuguese Ships Began Unloading Cargo Yesterday - Various Companies Discussing the Issue of Returning Goods</h3>
<p>Ten Portuguese ships, including Tangbei, Tangqiao, Tanglu, Meda, Hailong, Libao, Lude, Baode, Fulu, and Dade, were detained by Japanese warships one after another and are now anchored at various pontoons in Yangshupu, guarded by Japanese soldiers. Although the Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai protested and demanded their prompt release, the Japanese Consul-General Miura did not reply. However, the cargo on the ships has been allowed to be unloaded first. Except for the Tang-class ships, which had already unloaded fresh goods first, the official unloading began in batches yesterday. Yesterday, Meda and Hailong were unloaded. The remaining ships will be unloaded on dates set by the Japanese side. The Meriwether, Meder, Atlantic and other companies held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to discuss the issue of returning goods from the ships.</p>
<h3>Father and Son Go to Court - Father Accuses Son of Malicious Abandonment - Son Denies the Status of Father's Second Wife - Both Sides Maintain Their Positions and the Hearing Is Rescheduled</h3>
<p>Li Ganquan, a 66-year-old man from Nanhui, residing at No. 63 Baier Road, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession, along with his concubine Zhang (a 55-year-old woman from Suzhou), hired lawyer Wang Shouan to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division against his son from his deceased first wife, Li Keding (37 years old), and his daughter-in-law, Xia (28 years old), for malicious abandonment and failure to fulfill the obligation to provide for his basic needs. He requested the court to investigate and prosecute according to law and to order them to provide support through an ancillary civil suit. He claimed that the defendants and their spouses were unfilial and enjoyed their wealth with 洋房 and car exclusively, refusing to provide any financial support for the plaintiff's parents. Keding had won half of the top prize in an aviation lottery in the 24th year, receiving 125,000 yuan, which he shared with friends and relatives but gave nothing to his parents. After repeated negotiations in the 25th year, he finally agreed to pay 15 yuan per month for support. However, since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, he has stopped paying the agreed fee. Instead, he listened to his wife Xia and, along with servants, violently beat the plaintiff and pushed him out the door. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to send a letter for negotiation, but it was ineffective, so he is filing a lawsuit to request investigation and prosecution, and to order them to pay 50 yuan per month for living expenses, calculating 6,000 yuan for ten years, to be paid in one lump sum. Upon receiving the complaint, the court notified the defendants to appear. The defendant couple hired lawyer Yin Yong to defend them and submitted a defense, divided into two points: (1) Li Zhang, the plaintiff in this case, is not the mother of the defendant Li Keding and is unknown to him, so she has no right to file a private prosecution. He requests that the court order a stay of judgment on the part of Li Zhang's private prosecution in accordance with the law. (2) When the defendant Li Keding was four years old, his father, the plaintiff Li Ganquan, abandoned the family and never returned. Fortunately, his uncle Qiuquan maintained the family's life. Keding's mother passed away when he was seven years old, and he was raised and cultivated by his uncle Qiuquan until he graduated and took teaching positions at various schools. Since then, his father has often visited to ask for money, which he gave several times and left. He has no proper occupation to this day. Keding got married at the age of 33 and formed a family. He then invited his father to live with him, but he refused, and instead came to ask for money from time to time, without any restrictions. Because the monthly demands were too high to bear, his uncle Qiuquan mediated in the 25th year and agreed to pay 15 yuan per month for support, with a contract signed and certified by a lawyer. Every month, the money was entrusted to a third party for delivery or sent by post. After the August 13th Incident, Keding has been repairing and selling used cars in Shanghai and continues to fulfill the agreed monthly support payment. In addition to this, his father still often comes, insisting on staying for meals and being given three or five yuan. At the end of last year's lunar calendar, he asked for New Year's expenses and was given 15 yuan. The defendant Xia has always treated her father-in-law kindly and has never offended him. The relationship between father and son and father-in-law and daughter-in-law is harmonious. The allegations are not true. As for the point that the defendants violently beat the plaintiff at the end of last year, he requests that the neighbors be summoned for verification and detailed questioning, and that the defendants be found innocent and the ancillary civil suit be dismissed. The case was heard by Judge Zhang Mingsheng at 3:00 PM yesterday. Both parties and their lawyers were present. The plaintiff first stated the purpose of the lawsuit. The defendant couple absolutely denied the abandonment and beating, stating that the living expenses were paid every month without fail and that someone was involved in the transfer. The court verified the statements and decided to reschedule the hearing to the afternoon of May 3, and then adjourned the court. The clan elder Li Qiuquan and others from both sides also attended the court to listen.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Shandong Road</h3>
<p>Chen Jingsheng's residence at No. 7, Lane 352, near the intersection of Guangdong Road and Shandong Road, was suddenly broken into by robbers around 8:30 PM yesterday. At that time, the owner of the house was not at home, and all the other people were held under guard by the bandits, who rummaged through boxes and cabinets, looting for more than thirty minutes before leaving. Afterwards, the incident was reported to the police station, requesting them to pursue the case. The police station dispatched detectives to investigate and inquire about the appearance and accent of the bandits, and reported back to the police station for the purpose of pursuing the arrest. As for the losses, they are currently being tallied and are said to be quite large.</p>
<h3>Xujiahui Observatory (2)</h3>
<p>— Tang Minghe</p>
<p>Astronomical Research</p>
<p>The astronomical department of the Xujiahui Observatory is located on Yu Mountain, fifteen miles from Shanghai, and was founded in 1900. The observatory has a large equatorial instrument (telescope), with a lens length of seven meters and a lens diameter of forty 分. There are two such telescopes, arranged in parallel, one for photography and one for visual observation.</p>
<p>The world's largest telescope of the same type as the Sheshan Observatory is located in Yerkes, USA, with a lens diameter of one meter (39.37 inches). The telescope at Mt. Wilson in the United States is currently the world's largest reflecting telescope, with a lens diameter of one hundred inches. A reflecting telescope with a lens diameter of two hundred inches is currently being built in the United States, which will be the world's largest reflecting telescope in the future.</p>
<p>There is a common misconception about telescopes, which is that the larger the lens, the larger the objects can be magnified. In fact, the size of celestial bodies can be magnified entirely by the eyepiece. Therefore, the purpose of having a large lens is to concentrate the light. If the light is not enough, no matter how much you magnify it, you will never be able to see clearly.</p>
<p>The Sheshan telescope can enhance the light of a star of magnitude four to magnitude thirteen. In the past, it has photographed 12,000 sunspots and determined the positions of 14,000 celestial bodies. It has studied 1,200 binary stars and star clusters and has calculated the perturbations of Jupiter's orbit on other planets more than 100 times. This is a general overview of the work of the Sheshan Observatory.</p>
<p>The reporter asked when the next solar eclipse could be seen in Shanghai. Father Mao replied: It will be in 1941. The area where the total eclipse can be seen is between Hankou and Wenzhou. Shanghai can see more than nine-tenths of the solar eclipse.</p>
<p>Work in Other Places</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory has also conducted several inland expeditions, including an expedition to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, where it surveyed and mapped 54 maps and determined the locations of 50 cities. The Governor-General of Annam also invited the observatory to plan and establish meteorological stations. The lighthouses along the Chinese coast are also inspected by the observatory from time to time to check the accuracy of the instruments.</p>
<p>(3) Current Situation</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory is subsidized by the French Church, the French Municipal Council, and various shipping companies. Before the war, the Chinese government also contributed to the subsidy. Everything in the observatory is the responsibility of the priests. Initially, the Pope of Rome designated the Xujiahui Diocese to be managed by the French Church, so most of the priests in the observatory are French, but there is also an Italian priest now.</p>
<p>Past Priests</p>
<p>The first director of the observatory was Father Dechevrens, the second was Chevallier, the third was Father Froc, and the fourth, and current, is Father Lejay. The third priest served the longest, a total of 25 years. He is known as the "Father of Typhoons," which shows his contribution to predicting typhoons.</p>
<p>The current priests are: Director Father Yan (P. Lejay), Father Long (E. Gherzi) is responsible for climate and earthquakes, currently Father Mao (L. Dumas) - whom the reporter visited - is acting on his behalf and responsible for climate and earthquakes, Father Bu (M. Burgand) is responsible for electromagnetism and timekeeping, and travels back and forth between Sheshan and Shanghai, because since the war, the electromagnetic department in Zhaojiabang has been moved to Sheshan, and Father Wei (E. de la Villemarque) is responsible for the Sheshan Observatory.</p>
<p>Wartime Situation</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the current Sino-Japanese War, the government meteorological reporting stations along the Yangtze River and in the Chinese interior have stopped working. Fortunately, the stations in the Pacific and Fuzhou and Shantou continue to work. Therefore, the typhoon prediction work has not been affected in any way. According to Father Mao, looking at the clouds in the sky, it is possible to predict whether the local area will encounter a typhoon in 24 hours. Because the meteorological reporting stations in the interior and along the Chinese coast have all or mostly stopped reporting, Xujiahui cannot accurately predict the weather between Shanghai and Beijing, Shanghai and Hankou, and Shanghai and Guangzhou. Fortunately, these three air routes have all been suspended, so whether or not to predict is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The war has no direct impact on the work of Xujiahui.</p>
<p>(4) Chinese Astronomical Facts</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Xujiahui Observatory, the Qingdao Observatory was established at the beginning of the 20th century. Its scope was of course relatively narrow.</p>
<p>The Central Meteorological Observatory in Nanjing is the most well-equipped observatory in China, much more complete than Xujiahui. Although the internal instruments have been transported to the interior, they are scattered in various places and have not been installed for use. This is a pity, because the Central Meteorological Observatory not only occupies a leading position in China, but also has a considerable position in the world of astronomy. Although it was established not long ago, it has made a lot of research in astronomy.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no major astronomical work in China.</p>
<p>(5) Contribution of Catholicism to Chinese Astronomy</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Western missionaries introduced European astronomy to China in the 17th century. Unfortunately, the Chinese did not train talents to continue the work of the Westerners. Two hundred years later, the Xujiahui Observatory in Shanghai was established.</p>
<p>As for why Catholicism is interested in astronomy, or in science, is there a special scholarship system? There is none! However, Catholics feel that studying science is pursuing true knowledge, and there is no conflict between religion and science, and there should be no conflict. This is what they deeply believe now, so they have a strong interest in science.</p>
<p>Father Mao also explained that the purpose of the Xujiahui Observatory is to serve the people, without any color, and does not selectively serve anyone. (End)</p>

<h3>Major Robbery at Nantong Dasheng Textile Mill: Thieves Colluding from Within; Factory Firemen and Others Form a Gang to Rob Forcibly; Main Culprits Bian Minghui and Two Others Arrested; Confessions Must Be Verified and Jurisdiction Designated</h3>
<p>Cui Chengke, a Chinese detective chief, and detective Xu Dezhong of the Chengdu Road Police Station previously arrested six bandits, Bian Mingyi, Hu Cunyi, Zhu Shengtai, Bian Zhu-shi, Bian Cao-shi, and Bian Minghui, at No. 6 Lixian Lane, Xizilaihuo Street, and No. 38 Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road. Two passbooks for the Bank of Communications, totaling 1,400 yuan, and the China Industrial Bank, totaling 300 yuan, were confiscated. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. It is now learned that the police have found that Zhu Shengtai, Bian Cao-shi, and Bian Zhu-shi were not involved and have applied to the court for their release. The remaining three, Bian Mingyi and others, colluded with more than twenty other bandits in Tangjia Zha, Nantong, at 1:00 AM on January 30th of this year, and robbed the Dasheng Textile Mill of 87,279 yuan in legal tender, which they divided and spent. Yesterday morning, the police sent Bian Mingyi, Hu Cunyi, and Bian Minghui to the Second Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station filed a lawsuit for the crime of robbery with a gang under Article 320 of the Criminal Law. He detailed the case, saying that the defendant Bian Minghui was a member of the security team at the Nantong Dasheng Textile Mill, and his sister, Bian Xiuzhu (wife of Hu Cunyi), was a female worker at the Dasheng Textile Mill, so they were very familiar with the situation in the factory. Since the fall of Nantong, the factory had been shut down. Bian Minghui was then reassigned as a fireman, specializing in night watch duties. Unexpectedly, Bian and the others were well aware that a large sum of money was hidden in the factory warehouse, and they conceived a wicked plan. They colluded with Zhao Hongfei, Bian Xiuzhu's lover, and more than twenty bandits, including Yuan Zhengqing and Wang Jinbiao, and broke into the Dasheng Textile Mill on the night of January 29th, each carrying rifles and Mauser guns. Bian Minghui acted as an inside accomplice, and they looted over 80,000 yuan. They rested in an empty house nearby that night and then went to Shixu the next day to divide the spoils. Bian Mingyi received 1,500 yuan, Hu Cunyi received 500 yuan, Bian Minghui received 32,000 yuan, Bian Xiuzhu received 1,700 yuan, and the remaining money was divided among Yuan Zhengqing and others. The defendants then fled to Taixing and came to Shanghai via a detour, where they were arrested. Subsequently, Zhang Shenzhou, the deputy manager of the Dasheng Textile Mill, testified about the robbery, saying that the secret lock of the factory warehouse was only known to a staff member surnamed Jin, and that the defendants forcibly ordered Jin to open it. Judge Chuan Lin briefly questioned the defendants, stating that the case occurred in Nantong, and the court should apply to the Supreme Court for designation of jurisdiction. The hearing was adjourned for fourteen days for further review, and the defendants were remanded to custody. The stolen money, 1,700 yuan, was returned in advance.</p>
<h3>American Merchant's Apparent Suicide Attributed to Economic Pressure; Wife and Two Children Left Behind in Tragic Circumstances</h3>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Rosenfield, a 31-year-old American fur merchant in Shanghai, had offices at No. 117 Edward Road and No. 131 Museum Road, and was also a member of the American Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. This morning (the 24th) at around 8:00 AM, he was found dead in his Museum Road office, lying stiff in a pool of blood. A Shanghai Volunteer Corps service rifle was found beside the body. A friend of the deceased stated that he believed Rosenfield committed suicide due to the bleak prospects of the Shanghai fur trade after the Japanese cut off the supply sources, leading to economic difficulties. According to the authorities investigating the tragedy, the deceased left several notes mentioning economic hardship, suggesting that the case was clearly a suicide. It is reported that Rosenfield left behind a wife and two children. Upon hearing the news, his friends expressed deep regret.</p>
<p>A special report from this newspaper states that at 8:10 AM yesterday morning, an American youth at the Sun Tat Company on the third floor of the YMCA Building at No. 131 Museum Road in the Public Concession suddenly committed suicide with a rifle, the bullet hitting his head, causing instant death. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Career</p>
<p>J. Rosenfield was an American citizen, 35 years old, who had been in Shanghai for a long time. He had been running the Wing Woh Company at No. 117 Edward Road in the French Concession, engaging in import and export business. Before the August 13th Incident, the business was very good. Later, he also set up a branch at the Sun Tat Company on the third floor of No. 131 Museum Road, also engaging in import and export. Outside of his business, Rosenfield also joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps as a member, and had been for many years.</p>
<p>Losses</p>
<p>This American used to run the export of fur goods from North China. Recently, due to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, transportation was obstructed, and he was also subject to Japanese control, which affected his business. For the past two years, he has suffered huge losses, resulting in a high debt burden. The company's economic turnover was difficult, and the business of the two firms was difficult to maintain, so he conceived the idea of taking his own life.</p>
<p>Suicide</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at around 8:00 AM, Rosenfield, in the office of the Sun Tat Company on Museum Road, while the staff had not yet arrived, secretly used his usual Volunteer Corps rifle, loaded a bullet, aimed the muzzle at his head, and stepped on the trigger. With a bang, the bullet hit a vital spot, and he fell to the ground, blood gushing out. The servants heard the sound and went out to see him lying on the floor, barely breathing. They urgently reported to the Central Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene. He had already died.</p>
<p>Investigation</p>
<p>The body was then transported by car to Room No. 1 of the Universal Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road for preparation for burial. The office where the incident occurred was photographed and sealed off, pending investigation by experts. Rosenfield's residence was at a certain number on Tianfeng Road in West Shanghai. He left behind a wife and two daughters. The wife was young and the daughters were only four years old.</p>
<h3>Woman Falsely Accused of Drug Trafficking; Acquitted on Appeal</h3>
<p>Hu Zhang-shi, a woman from Dongtai residing at No. 27, Lane 24, Danshui Road, was implicated in a drug trafficking case involving her neighbor, Hu Chen-shi. She was sentenced to twelve years in prison by the First Special Court. Hu Zhang-shi refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. The hearing has concluded, and yesterday, Judge Yu Hua, accompanied by associate judges Nie and Cai, opened the court to announce the verdict: the original judgment was revoked, and Hu Zhang-shi was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Bus Accident; Company Provides Compensation to Family; Company Compensates Deceased's Mother with 500 Yuan; Deceased's Brother Accepted as Apprentice and Provided with Education</h3>
<p>Peng Xuehuang, a native of Yangzhou, used to drive the No. 385 bus for the Public Bus Company. At 9:30 AM on the 15th of this month, Peng was driving bus No. 15003 eastward on Xinza Road. When the bus reached near Wenzhou Road, a cyclist suddenly fell in front of the bus. Peng urgently tried to avoid him, but due to the rainy weather and slippery road, the front of the bus swerved sharply to the north, knocking down an electric pole and a water hydrant, and killing a pedestrian named Zhang Amao (17 years old, from Nanxiang). Afterward, the Xinza Police Station moved the body to the coroner's office and filed a public prosecution against Peng. Yesterday morning, Peng was summoned to the First Special Court, and police attorney Li Zhishan presented the case. However, regarding the private prosecution part attached by the plaintiff, the Public Bus Company's annual legal advisors, lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Qian Guangzhong, and the plaintiff's lawyer, Yu Xiangqin, reached a settlement, returning 500 yuan to the plaintiff, the deceased's mother, and accepting the deceased's second son, Zhang Shuxian, age ten, into the Public Bus Company as an apprentice, providing education as a condition. Both parties had no objections. Judge Chuan then questioned the defendant and announced that the verdict would be pronounced on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>German Firm Kumpst Sued by Chinese Manager; Gao Zhaoyuan Sues for Commission and Guarantee Money; Court Orders Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation, Hearing Postponed</h3>
<p>German national Xie Fu (transliteration), the legal representative of the German firm Kumpst, was recently sued by Gao Zhaoyuan, the former Chinese manager of the firm's oil department, who hired lawyers Ma Shouhua and Li Zongpei to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering payment of commissions and return of guarantee money totaling 30,087.82 yuan. The facts of the lawsuit were that the plaintiff had previously served as the Chinese manager of the defendant's oil department, based on a contract. He has now resigned, but upon settlement of accounts, the defendant owes the plaintiff a large amount of commissions and guarantee money. (1) Regarding the unpaid commissions over the years, this refers to the commissions that should have been paid over the years but were overdue, totaling 3,647.90 yuan from 1931 to 1936, as detailed in the Clear Account Statement of Unpaid Commissions over the Years. This statement was compiled by checking the invoices for each transaction of the defendant. The defendant has an invoice for each transaction, and commissions are calculated based on the invoices. Now, after checking, it was found that many transactions were not paid commissions, and it should be ordered to present the invoices and account books for verification, which will be clear after reading. (2) Regarding the underpaid commissions over the years, this refers to the commissions that were underpaid based on the value of the goods stated on the invoices and the commission percentage stipulated in the contract, totaling 13,367.47 yuan from 1932 to 1937. According to the contract, commissions should be paid according to the value of the goods stated on the invoices and the agreed percentage, as stipulated in Article 11 of the contract. Now, it was found that many transactions did not calculate commissions based on the value of the goods stated on the invoices and the agreed percentage. For example, if the value of the goods stated on the invoice was 523.64 yuan, the defendant actually calculated it as 497.46 yuan; if the agreed percentage was 4.75%, the defendant actually calculated it as 3%. There are many such cases. (3) Regarding the recently owed commissions and salaries, the plaintiff sent a letter to the defendant on October 31st of last year to resign, and the defendant replied on November 2nd of the same year approving the resignation. According to Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the contract, the termination of employment should be at the end of January of this year. Now, the defendant has withheld the plaintiff's due commissions and salaries for October, November, December of last year and January of this year, totaling 3,837.10 yuan, on various pretexts. (4) Regarding the return of the guarantee money deposited over the years, the plaintiff successively deposited a total of 9,235.35 yuan of guarantee money in the defendant's firm, with 23 receipts issued by the defendant as evidence. This guarantee money should be returned in full when the contract is canceled. However, after repeated requests, the defendant tried to deny it on various pretexts. Based on the above, it is requested that the defendant be ordered to pay the plaintiff a total of 30,087.82 yuan, including the guarantee money of 9,235.35 yuan, and statutory interest, etc. Yesterday morning, this case was heard in the Second Civil Tribunal by Judge Li Hu, with the plaintiff represented by lawyers Ma and Li, who detailed the above situation. The defendant also hired a lawyer to appear in court, stating that according to the contract, arbitration must be carried out first, so the plaintiff cannot file a lawsuit. Judge Li ruled that the case be heard again on May 12th, instructing both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court. It is heard that the plaintiff has applied for preservation of evidence, which has been approved by the court.</p>
<h3>Landlord Uses Thuggish Tactics to Force Rent Payment; Illegally Detains Tenant; Zhang Zengfu Detained and Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment as a Warning</h3>
<p>Pan Jilong, a 55-year-old man from Changzhou, rented the house at No. 46, Lane 401, Dengtuo Road, from Zhang Zengfu (also known as Zhang Zhiqing), a Shanghai native residing at No. 40 of the same lane, for a monthly rent of 14 yuan. Before the August 13th Incident, Pan owed rent of about 100 yuan. After the war broke out, Pan fled back to his hometown. He returned to Shanghai in November 1938 and returned to his old residence. Recently, Zhang repeatedly demanded that Pan pay the outstanding rent. However, Pan stated that he was in financial difficulty and could not pay for the time being, so he negotiated with Zhang to pay after the situation stabilized. Unexpectedly, Zhang colluded with a staff member surnamed Liu of the puppet organization Fuxingban, intending to use their influence to forcibly demand payment, but it was ineffective. On the 23rd of the month, at 9:00 PM, Zhang and Liu dragged Pan into the Linping Road police station of the puppet municipal government. Without asking for reasons, they detained Pan. On the morning of the 24th, Pan's daughter-in-law, Zhang-shi, reported to the Huishan Police Station. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the puppet police station on Linniu Road, and found the Japanese advisor. The Japanese advisor severely reprimanded the police station chief for improperly managing the matter and detaining people without authorization. Pan was released immediately. The detectives then arrested Zhang Zengfu and sent him to the Fourth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police Attorney Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit for the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 304 of the Criminal Law, stating that if Zhang believed that Pan had indeed owed rent, he could legally pursue legal action in court, and should not use thuggish tactics to detain people. It should be requested to be severely punished according to law. Zhang did not deny it. Judge Meng Tingke announced the verdict: Zhang Zengfu was sentenced to three years imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Two Cars Collide; Westerner Dies Tragically; Two Women Also Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>At around 9:40 PM last night on Broadway, Hongkou, a bus operated by the Japanese authorities collided with a private black-plated car driven by a Westerner named Hiller. As a result, both cars were severely damaged. Hiller, the driver, died instantly due to fatal injuries. Hiller's wife, who was in the same car, suffered serious head injuries and was sent to the Country Hospital by police patrol car. Lu Baowen, an 18-year-old female ticket seller on the bus from Ningbo, also suffered head injuries. Ambulance No. 82 was called to the scene and she was transported to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries were serious and her life was in danger. At the same time, a Western police officer named Wensha also had his left foot crushed and was sent to the Country Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Broken Up at Zhongnan Hotel</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a detective chief of the Laoza Police Station of the Public Concession learned that a gambling den was being set up in Room 411 on the fourth floor of the Zhongnan Hotel at the northern end of the Dongxin Bridge on Edward Road. He immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives and Japanese police detectives, totaling thirty or forty people, to rush to the hotel entrance in red police cars. They swarmed into Room 411 on the fourth floor and broke up a gambling operation set up by Chaozhou people (namely, Qinglong Baihu Si Men), who were enthusiastically gambling. The detectives arrested a total of twenty-nine gamblers on the spot, and transported them and the gambling equipment to the Laoza Police Station by car, pending interrogation by the First Special Court this morning. It is said that this was the second time a gambling den had been broken up.</p>
<h3>A Woman of Loose Morals; The Romantic History of Cheng Ying; Eleventh Husband Sued and Convicted; Factory Owner's Wife Accuses Cheng of Enticing Adultery</h3>
<p>Zhao Liyuan, the owner of a well-drilling factory in Jiangyin, saw an advertisement in the newspaper in early September two years ago in which Ms. Cheng Ying modestly sought cohabitation, and the only condition was that she could afford to support her. He responded to the advertisement, and after a meeting, they were very compatible, so they began to cohabit. By January of this year, the two sides had a falling out, and Cheng Ying filed a criminal complaint against Zhao for fraud, seduction, bodily harm, and obstruction of freedom. As a result of the first instance, Zhao Liyuan was legally warned by the First Special District Local Court. Zhao refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but still failed. Therefore, Zhao's wife, Yi-shi, started anew, and hired lawyer Shen Ronghua to file a criminal self-accusation in the First Special Court, accusing Cheng Ying of enticing her husband Zhao Liyuan to commit adultery. The complaint stated that she married Zhao Liyuan as his wife on January 21st of the Republic of China 17th year, and had already given birth to four children. Last November, her husband sold the house on Malong Road and moved to the Liyuan well-drilling factory on Haifang Road, and when she saw the defendant cohabiting with her husband in the factory, she realized they were committing adultery. Later, after reading the court's judgment on the case of her husband being accused by the defendant of harming public morals, she learned that the adultery occurred due to the defendant's advertisement seeking friends for cohabitation. It was found that her husband had lost nearly half a million yuan in property since being enticed to commit adultery, causing the whole family to be heartbroken. She originally wanted to sue her husband Zhao Liyuan in the same case, but considering that Zhao had already suffered mental pain and economic losses, she forgave him and only requested that the defendant Cheng Ying be summoned and punished according to law. It is understood that Ms. Cheng is indeed over thirty years old, and her cohabitation with Zhao Liyuan is her eleventh husband. This woman not only widely placed "surface leaders" but also loved to prepare many nicknames. In addition to Cheng Ying, Cheng Yanbai, Cheng Biru, Cheng Tongyun, Cheng Ying, etc., are all her aliases. From the first to the eighth husband, most of them were small bureaucrats. The ninth was Tao Jianhua, who once served as the inspector-general of the Jiangsu Anti-Smoking Bureau. He had no reputation at first, but after the National Army moved west, he raised the anti-Japanese banner in the Pudong area, repeatedly defeating the enemy, and is now a county magistrate and commander of the guerrillas. Her tenth husband was the doctor Wei Guangcai. Cheng graduated from the Cihang Midwifery School, obtaining this like-minded "straw sandals," and should have been able to grow old together. Unexpectedly, they still separated and reunited, posted advertisements to find another target, and Zhao Liyuan became her eleventh guest. But in the end, they couldn't stay together forever. This is a rare and strange continuation in the history of modern marriage. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Zhao Xuan-shi, was represented in court by her lawyer, Shen Ronghua, who stated the intention of the prosecution and submitted photos of the defendant Cheng Ying when she married others in the past, as well as newspapers containing various past events of the woman, to prove the defendant's romantic behavior. When the defendant was questioned in court, she admitted that she posted an advertisement seeking friends and Zhao Liyuan voluntarily came to her home to apply and then cohabited. Later, she moved with Zhao to the factory he opened, etc., without denying it. However, she firmly stated that she did not know that Zhao had a wife at first, and that before cohabiting, she had personally gone to the factory to investigate, and the workers in the factory said that the factory owner had never had a wife. It was not she who enticed Zhao, but Zhao who enticed her, etc. After the defendant's lawyer, Li Gengxiang, debated with the plaintiff's lawyer, Judge Zhan ruled that the verdict would be announced at a later date.</p>
<h3>Outerwear Stained by Car Wheel; Bowl Thrown in Attack; Chen Qianchang Seriously Injured in Head</h3>
<p>Chen Qianchang, a 31-year-old Ningbo native who works as a deliveryman for the Nan Wanfeng (Datonghang) tobacco and paper shop at No. 501 Fuxu Road, was riding a bicycle yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 PM to withdraw 1,500 yuan from the Guanghua Bank on Tianjin Road. He then turned into the Ningbo Road Tobacco Guild to deliver the money. Just a few steps from his destination, a pedestrian in a blue cloth gown, nearly thirty years old, carrying a vegetable basket with a red-flowered bowl inside, was walking in the middle of the road. Chen, fearing that he would bump into the person, rang his bicycle bell several times, but the pedestrian acted as if he had not heard. As a result, the tire soiled his outerwear. The two sides started arguing, and after arguing for a long time, the pedestrian grabbed a bowl from the basket and threw it at Chen's head. Chen was unable to avoid it in time, resulting in a head injury with blood flowing, and the bowl shattered. At this time, several old clerks from the Tobacco Guild who knew him came and helped to arrest the assailant, and called the police to send the injured person to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Children Quarrel; Revenge with Knife</h3>
<p>Zhang Fengchi, a 48-year-old Shaoxing native who works as a laborer at the Public Concession Bureau of Donations, residing at No. 4, Guifu Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, his son Zhang Lianzhang, 16 years old this year, went out shopping at 3:30 PM on the 23rd. While passing in front of the car shop on Ximen Road, he was suddenly stabbed in the back by Liao Changsheng (15 years old), a boy from Zhenjiang residing at No. 439 Belle Road, with a small foreign knife five or six inches long. The wound was about two or three inches deep, and he fell to the ground. After Zhang and his wife learned about it, they sent the injured child to Nanyang Hospital for treatment and reported to the police, who arrested and detained Liao Changsheng. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Tribunal of the Second Special Court. Lawyer Yuan Jiahong, the lawyer for the administrative authorities of the French Concession, filed a lawsuit for the crime of injury. The plaintiff's father stated that the two children had quarreled at the end of last year and must have been retaliating for this. There was no other hatred. When Liao Changsheng was questioned, he confessed to the crime. Liao's mother was in the courtroom listening. Judge Qiu summoned the case and reprimanded her,责备 her for not properly educating her family and should be held responsible. He then ordered that the case be adjourned for further questioning after the injury was examined. The defendant was detained.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton; Sales of Chinese Yarn Surge in Tianjin; Japanese Yarn Prices Soar Wildly</h3>
<p>The yarn market first fell and then rose, and continued to advance. Although the situation in Shantou was tense and demand was sluggish, purchasing in Hong Kong turned prosperous again. Tianjin merchants in the north, who have always specialized in Japanese yarn, have recently been buying up the products of Tianjin Hengyuan and Beiyang factories, such as 20-count Sanding, Baxian, and 17-count Sanding yarn, due to the lower price of Chinese yarn. As a result, morale was boosted and the market strengthened. The intentions of inland merchants also changed, and the business of local yarn turned from weak to strong, and selling prices were increased instead. In the afternoon, most people believed that Japanese yarn was expensive and the cotton mills on this street had already switched to using Chinese yarn. They were optimistic about the market. 20-count Shuangma yarn was being sold for 400 yuan, but the factory continued to open up in large quantities. However, the peers were enthusiastic and bought it all up.</p>
<p>The situation of spot yarn: when the market first opened yesterday morning, it was reported that Wenzhou Oujiang was automatically blockaded, port cargo transportation was stagnant, and Japanese warships were causing disturbances in Fujian Province. Morale was not good, and everyone discussed having a small face and the opening price fell by 2 yuan. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 396.5 yuan, and the stack unit price was 393.5 yuan. Soon after, Guangbang agents representing Hong Kong helped continue to purchase, and the market situation suddenly became tight and rose. Purchase prices rose step by step. Tianjin merchants from the north bought up Tianjin goods again, and morale was even higher. Sales prices gradually rose again. By the closing price, 20-count Shuangma yarn was being sold for 399.5 yuan, and the stack unit price was 395.5 yuan. The market situation was even stronger when the market opened in the afternoon. Demand from inland was not weak, and the spot price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 400 yuan, up another 5 jiao. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 1,935 packages throughout the day. The market price of 20-count Shuangma yarn rose by 1.5 yuan, and other yarn remained stable as usual. The Xinsheng Factory opened 1,120 packages of 20-count Jinhu yarn at a price of 386 yuan. The Chongxin Factory opened 150 packages of 20-count Dafa yarn at a price of 390 yuan. The Yongan Factory opened 150 packages of 20-count Tejincheng yarn at a price of 407.5 yuan. The Defeng Factory opened 800 packages of 10-count Shuangshi yarn at a price of 308 yuan. Today, 610 pieces of yarn will be transported to Tianjin. The amount bought by each gang is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Hong Kong 455 Peers 555</p>
<p>Shantou 100 Tianjin 515</p>
<p>Yunnan 50 Inland 210</p>
<p>North gang 50 Total 1,935</p>
<p>The market price of Japanese yarn is soaring, and the market situation is very chaotic. There are often price fluctuations of several yuan in all the open markets. According to the market, this time it is all the Tianjin gang and the Qingdao gang who are in a bullish position and are squeezing very hard, so the rising trend is still like drunk and crazy. The price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 375 yuan this month, and there is a saying that the price for the next month will be squeezed to 380 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Export Subsidy To Be Implemented Starting July 1st, But Most Legislators Have Not Yet Agreed</h3>
<p>The price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, rose again yesterday by five to six pounds sterling due to heavy buying of swaps and by banks in the market in May. A Washington source, Congressman Penk Hai, said that US President Roosevelt has agreed to this cotton export subsidy bill. It is tentatively set that for new cotton exports this year, 7 million bales can receive an export subsidy of 2 cents per pound from the government. This bill will be implemented starting July 1st and will be valid for one year. Exporters can request the government to provide cash or loans to store cotton, but most legislators do not agree with this subsidy plan, fearing that cotton prices will plummet and new cotton will be repeatedly used as collateral for loans. However, according to Penk Hai, this new plan can promote new cotton exports and will not be used for loans, while cotton prices will rise and hover around nine cents. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell one rupee including forecasts, Egyptian cotton was unchanged. Converted to legal tender, US cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 3 jiao, Indian cotton fell by 4 jiao, and Egyptian cotton was different.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet, mainly because there were many foreign cotton arrivals. According to reporter investigations, each factory has enough raw cotton of 10s and 20s counts to use for three months. However, raw materials of 32s counts and above are very scarce, and very few of these raw materials are being shipped. If the US cotton export subsidy can be realized, then each factory can purchase US cotton. The following is the conversion of yesterday's cotton market to delivery to the factories:</p>
<p>The local cotton business is still sustainable, but a large amount of provincial fees still lack vitality. This is because a batch of Indian cotton ordered by each factory has arrived in Shanghai this month, and the factories have ample supply. They have no intention of trying expensive local cotton, so recent transactions are still sluggish. 3,000 bales of Zhejiang cotton were scheduled to arrive in Shanghai, but they have been affected by the Jiang blockade and have not yet arrived in Shanghai today. Cotton merchants from the Subei area have made every effort to dredge, transporting 731 bales, with asking prices of 77.70 to 78.70 yuan. Also, 100 pieces of cotton arrived from Xingang yesterday. The situation of each cotton is listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Oil Market Raw Soybean Oil Repeatedly Sees New High Prices Raw Soybean Oil Has Risen Sixteen Yuan Since January Raw Oil at 5 Jiao Per Jin, Soybean Oil at 4 Jiao 8 Yesterday, 3,400 Pieces Were Shipped From Qinglian</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the raw soybean oil market consistently fell by one or two yuan, but its highest price set a new record. Dalian soybean oil reached 49 yuan, and Jiaozhou raw oil was 45 yuan, compared to the same day last month. Dalian soybean oil rose 16.70 yuan (selling price on March 24 was 32.30 yuan), and Jiaosheng oil rose 16 yuan (29 yuan). Currently, people's hearts are still excited. Yesterday's small correction is not enough to affect the pursuit of speculators, so the public's life will inevitably have a day of vegetables without oil. Yesterday, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were opened, priced at 44 to 45 yuan, and the northern standard price was 58.50 to 59 yuan. 150 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were traded, priced at 35.50 to 36 yuan. 50 large baskets of Lianqi soybean oil were traded, priced at 46 to 46.50 yuan. More than 200 barrels of Dalian barrel soybean oil were traded, priced at 48 to 49 yuan. Yesterday, each jin of raw oil from the oil shops sold for 5 jiao 1 fen, soybean oil for 4 jiao 8 fen, and vegetable oil for 3 jiao 8 fen.</p>
<p>On March 24, 700 pieces of soybean oil were imported from Dalian and 250 pieces from Qingdao, 1,780 pieces of raw oil from Qingdao, and 700 pieces of vegetable oil from Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Securities Domestic Debt Weakens Again Chinese Business Common Stock Is Almost Worthless</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter securities market was slightly depressed yesterday. This was mostly due to the blockade of Ouhai, which caused people's hearts to be slightly disturbed. However, as it was unrelated to the official price, it stabilized in the afternoon and remained in a hovering state. People's hearts were slightly dazed, and retail investors slightly increased their selling. Large institutional investors remained steadfast, and the trend will temporarily hover without major fluctuations. Yesterday's trend: Tian Sheng Run Li opened in the morning and was sold at a bargained price. Da Tong, Tong Kang, and No. 12 were all sold, but buyers were not enthusiastic. San Kai, Heng Fu, Yong Kang, Zhen Kang, and No. 42 were all in demand, but these were all scattered transactions, so supply and demand were uneven. It fell slightly by 4 or 5 jiao in the morning. Transactions were clearer in the afternoon. No. 42 continued to buy in, and Yong Kang and Tong Kang also had considerable demand. Yong Feng was the main seller, and Xing Yuan and No. 35 slightly reduced their holdings. The market was firmer. The total result was a slight decrease of 4 jiao to 5 jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was estimated at more than 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions: More than 80 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 6 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<p>The public exchange stock market was very deserted, but people's hearts were still firm. Although the German parliament's declaration this Friday was ahead, sellers did not seek to sell because of this. Jardine and Ruidong shares were outstanding. Ruidong shares rose to 7 yuan 05 fen. Public bus shares reached a new high price of 27 yuan (ex-dividend).</p>
<p>Today, I read the reorganization plan of China Business Company. According to calculations, the common stock is almost worthless. However, it is still specially allowed to account for about 2% of the new capital (that is, every 20 old shares are converted into one new share). This plan seems to be approved by the public. As for the 8% bonds of the company and the accumulated interest, they are distributed as 10 yuan new common shares. The new shares are currently worth about 5 yuan, so every 100 taels of bonds can have a value of 67 taels.</p>
<h3>Finance Cash Is Being Dumped At All Sides The Last Seller Shouted A Price of 2,063 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash bullion over-the-counter market was quite stagnant and meaningless, because the public had no interest and was waiting for the reaction of the situation's evolution. However, the situation was slightly weak. Although a certain silver shop acted on behalf of the Hong Kong gang to absorb purchases, the silver shops were selling heavily, and other firms imitated their actions, causing the potential to weaken. By noon, the price had fallen to 2,069 yuan. In the afternoon, merchants and speculators were more eager to sell, and buyers were cautious, so the situation became even weaker. It was said that the last seller shouted a price of 2,063 or 2,064 yuan to sell. As a result, it fell by 5 jiao according to the closing price at noon, but in fact, it had fallen by 5 or 6 yuan. People's hearts were weak, and transactions were dull. Only about 400 taels were traded in the morning, and there were no transactions in the afternoon. Silver ornaments in silver shops remained unchanged. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Bullion over-the-counter market fell by 5 jiao</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (10 taels) had no transactions for a long time due to scarce supply and demand. Until 9:50, the first transaction was 20 taels between money changers, with an opening price of 2,071 yuan, 1 yuan and 5 jiao higher than the end of last week. After the opening, although a certain silver shop acted on behalf of the Hong Kong gang to absorb purchases, the amount was limited, and silver shops and gold shops were selling heavily, so the situation was slightly weak. A silver shop sold 50 taels to a certain silver shop, with the same price as the morning opening. Then, a silver shop sold another 50 taels to a certain silver shop, priced at 70 yuan. At the same price, a silver shop sold 50 taels to a gold shop. Later, a certain gold shop also sold 50 taels to a cash shop and a money changer each, with the price still at 70 yuan. After that, money changers traded 50 taels with each other, with the price at 69 yuan. Soon, a silver shop sold 50 taels to a money changer, with the price at the same price. After that, supply and demand were quiet, and there were no transactions until noon, so the closing price at noon was still 69 yuan. In the afternoon, merchants and speculators were eager to sell, and buyers were temporarily cautious, so the situation became even weaker. Although the seller's price was shouted down to 63 or 64 yuan, it was still difficult to find a buyer. No transaction was seen until the evening closing. If the closing price at noon was 2,069 yuan, the result was a decrease of 5 jiao compared to last Saturday. The difference for the whole day was only 2 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,070 yuan, and the buying price was 2,060 yuan. The current gold standard was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Silver ornaments in silver shops remain unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver ornaments in silver shops per tael remains unchanged. Da Tong Hang is still 210 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang is 208 yuan, with a buying price of 202 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British pure gold remains stagnant</p>
<p>The buying price of Chinese cash by the Central Bank is 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold price is unchanged at 2 yuan 3 jiao 9 fen and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price is also still 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao, which is due to the fact that the London telegram on the 22nd stated that British pure gold was still stable, with each ounce fixed at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 and a half pence.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market No Change</h3>
<p>Although major foreign banks were competing with each other in the foreign exchange market yesterday, British and American foreign banks were still willing to provide funds, and export firms and Bombay silver companies once slightly sold. Therefore, the process became more stable, and the results were all flat. However, the process was still calm and there were very few changes. Trading was still active. Although speculators and non-professionals were dumping Hong Kong exchange, Chinese and foreign banks were still absorbing strongly, so the supply and demand were equal. Therefore, the results were also not divided into success or failure.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's major terms remained unchanged, and the forward term continued to shrink by 0.0625. New York's silver price remained stagnant, and London's raw gold had no rise or fall. The exchange rate of British currency against the US dollar, against Shanghai, and against France was flat. The US dollar was 0.0625 against the British pound, and still flat against Shanghai and France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price was 8 pence 25 for the British pound and 16 yuan 0.0625 for the US dollar, with no success or failure compared to the end of last week. After the opening, although foreign banks came to compete, the British bank HSBC was willing to supply, so the situation was stable. HSBC's listed price was unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also unchanged, remaining at 5.00%. After that, an export firm suddenly sold the spot US dollar at 16 yuan 0.09375 to an import firm, so the potential became more stable. Subsequently, an import firm slightly purchased the spot US dollar at 16 yuan 0.0625 from a certain bank. Near noon, transactions became clearer. Only Hong Kong exchange was slightly traded. A speculator sold the spot Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan to a Chinese bank, and the situation was also flat. By the time the bank's selling price closed at noon, the British and American currencies were the same as the morning opening.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a foreign bank first competed with the British bank HSBC for the spot British pound at 8 pence 25. Then, the Bombay Silver Company suddenly dumped the spot US dollar at 16 yuan 0.09375 to a certain bank, so the situation became more stable. After that, a foreign firm, Holland-China Trading, sold the spot Hong Kong dollar at 56 yuan to a foreign bank, and the situation was still quite stable. By the time the bank's spot selling price closed in the evening, the British pound was 8 pence 25, the US dollar was 16 yuan 0.0625, and the Hong Kong dollar was 56 yuan. As a result, there was no difference between the British, American, and Hong Kong currencies compared to the noon closing last week.</p>

Bullion dealers and money changers slightly supplied funds. The demand from customers and retail investors was not smooth, and the trend hovered. In the afternoon, the silver shop's customers and others were eager to sell, and the buyers' asking price was very harsh, so no transactions were made. The trend was weak. The demand for foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds was very scarce. The supply and demand for British and American gold notes was still strong, with the British currency weak and the US dollar stable. The demand for Hong Kong notes, French francs, Siamese notes, and Dutch notes was relatively strong, and the market price rose slightly. There was a supply of German gold notes, and the price trend was weak. The demand for Australian gold notes had decreased and had dropped to the old price.

<h3>Piece Goods With The Blockade Of Wenzhou The Outlet For Domestic Cloth Becomes More Deserted Eastern Piece Goods and Northern Sales Are More Active</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's market was in contrast to Dongbu cloth, due to the blockade of Wenzhou, the sudden halt of freight, the evacuation of the population and materials from Shantou and Chaozhou, and the sudden decline in the stomach. Therefore, actual demand is becoming more calm and people are relaxing. However, the demand in Sichuan, Yunnan, and the hemp chapter and Leizhou Beihai areas of Guangdong is still strong, and 6,000-odd pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, bleached cloth, and printed satin have been traded. The waterway freight in the guerrilla areas of Jiangnan, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, and other places is prosperous, and more than 5,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, and poplin have been added. More than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, bleached cloth, colored cloth, and poplin were handled in Subei, Dongtai, Taizhou, and other places. The sales of bleached and dyed cloth are generally the same as before, and although the opening price of white coarse cloth was about 1 jiao higher per piece than last Saturday, the market was again chaotic due to the cheap sale of hand goods, and transactions were scattered. The wholesale shops on this street handled more than 100 packages, and transactions of fine cloth and fine twill were also weak, and prices fell slightly. The Minbang area is uneasy due to the fierce bombing of Japanese aircraft, and the Gong Sheng incident has not been resolved. The purchase and loading of various goods has been postponed. The Tianjin gang in the northern route is urging the loading of reserved goods, and the intention to purchase new goods such as striped element poplin and striped bleached cloth is slightly weak.</p>
<p>Dongbu Cloth</p>
<p>White cloth and fine twill, due to the active sales market in the northern route, and the Qingdao telegraph that each piece has soared by 3 jiao, the hearts of the people in this city are unanimously high. The Tianjin and Qingdao gangs raised prices in the morning and absorbed more than 700 packages of various brands of fine cloth and fine twill, which were all increased by 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao compared with last Saturday's market. The market then slightly returned 2.5 fen. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth was opened at 13 yuan 3 jiao, and futures for the next month required 13 yuan 4 jiao.

The source of Japanese goods has also been greatly reduced. Therefore, although a large number of British products were imported, the sellers were unwilling to let go.

Yesterday, white flannel was sold in batches for 12 yuan 5 jiao per yard, feather yarn fabric No. 1 was 8 yuan, No. 2 was 7 yuan 2 jiao and a half, No. 3 was 6 yuan 4 jiao, and No. 4 was 4 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen.

Except for about 8,000 bags of retail in this street, the rest were sold to Beiyang, Nanyang, and various inland routes.

<h3>A Record of a Conversation Between Two Guests</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>Last evening, two unexpected guests arrived. After the pleasantries, the first guest suddenly stated that being a doctor was a better profession than others, as it quickly led to a life of comfort and wealth. Just as I was about to speak, the second guest defended doctors, saying that being a doctor was difficult. Had he not seen the endless stream of medical malpractice cases in recent years? The first guest then asked a strange question: "Suppose a doctor performs a proper surgery on a patient, and the patient dies during the surgery. What then?" The second guest replied, "This can only be resolved by the court. It must be investigated to determine the cause of death, whether the doctor acted intentionally, or if not intentional, whether they were negligent. If intentional, they should be charged with murder; if negligent, they should be charged with manslaughter; if the death was unavoidable, then there is no guilt." The first guest said, "However, suppose the patient's family consults with a lawyer, who intimidates the doctor into a settlement. The doctor, perhaps unaware of the law, is fooled and submits meekly, obeying their demands, whether it be being barred from practicing in the area, or being required to pay for the life of the deceased and the emotional distress of the living. Is this acceptable?" The second guest replied, "No, such a thing is impossible. Lawyers are law-abiding and would never act like the malicious lawyers of the past." Hearing this, I sighed at the first guest's far-fetched ideas. I had never heard of such a situation, and it likely never existed. After the guests left, I pondered their words! I couldn't help but shudder. The idea of being barred from practicing in the area was especially shocking. Even if a doctor committed a crime under Article 276, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, their practice could only be revoked after a final judgment, in accordance with Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations for Medical Practitioners. It could never be settled privately through intimidation, nor could their practice be revoked through a private contract. When doctors treat patients, they certainly do not intend to cause death. Whether there was negligence in their practice requires various evidence, with pathological autopsy evidence being especially important. In the case of death during surgery, setting aside the perspectives of both human sentiment and the law, the cause of death must be investigated. Therefore, doctors who experience such an unfortunate event must rely on the judgment of the law. If the negligence is their own, they must accept the punishment of the law. However, death during surgery has many causes and may not always be the doctor's fault. Trying to suppress the matter and seize someone's life would be a grave mistake, creating an excuse for others, potentially leading to financial ruin. Alas, if that were the case, being a doctor would be difficult indeed.</p>

<h3>Blood Pressure in Healthy People</h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>The more civilized the world becomes, the more complex human affairs become. Consequently, human diseases also increase. Cases of stroke are frequently seen in newspapers, drawing public attention to blood pressure, as high blood pressure often leads to stroke. Therefore, I will describe the blood pressure of healthy people as follows:</p>
<p>Blood pressure refers to the pressure exerted on the walls of blood vessels when the heart pumps blood into them. At this time, the vessel walls are tense and subject to a certain pressure, which is called blood pressure. This pressure exists in arteries, veins, and capillaries, but the commonly referred to blood pressure is arterial blood pressure. Arterial blood pressure can be further divided into three types: systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure. Systolic blood pressure is the highest pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts and is commonly referred to as blood pressure. When the heart expands, the pressure decreases. This pressure is called diastolic blood pressure. The difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure is called pulse pressure or pulse amplitude. The instrument used to measure blood pressure is called a sphygmomanometer, which comes in mercury and aneroid types, but the principle is the same. The numbers displayed indicate millimeters of mercury.</p>
<p>The average blood pressure of healthy people is as follows:</p>
<p>Men     Women</p>
<p>Systolic Blood Pressure  111-130   101-130</p>
<p>Diastolic Blood Pressure 51-80    46-80</p>
<p>Pulse Pressure  50-60    50-60</p>
<p>The ratio of the differences between the three is approximately 3:2:1.</p>
<p>However, blood pressure in healthy people is not constant and can vary depending on the following factors:</p>
<p>1. Age: Blood pressure increases with age. This is shown below:</p>
<p>Reading the table below reveals that systolic blood pressure is very low in children under ten. After ten, it is close to that of adults. After fifty, although the cause of increased blood pressure is difficult to identify, it increases somewhat.</p>
<p>2. Weight: The higher the body weight, the higher the blood pressure.</p>
<p>3. Height: The taller the body, the higher the blood pressure.</p>
<p>4. Gender: Women generally have lower blood pressure than men. In Europeans, the difference is about 7.5-10 millimeters of mercury.</p>
<p>5. Daily Variations: Blood pressure is lowest in the morning and gradually rises, reaching its peak between 3 PM and 7 PM, then decreases again. However, this varies with individual lifestyles.</p>
<p>6. Sleep: Blood pressure decreases significantly during sleep, especially deep sleep.</p>
<p>7. Exercise: Blood pressure increases during exercise and decreases during rest.</p>
<p>8. Mental State: Blood pressure often increases during mental excitement or painful stimulation.</p>
<p>9. Diet: Blood pressure generally rises after eating due to stomach expansion and increased abdominal pressure. Blood pressure rises again about three hours later due to visceral nerve tension and the absorption of digestive components. Blood pressure rises noticeably about half an hour after drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>10. Climate: In warm weather, blood vessels dilate and blood pressure decreases. In cold weather, blood vessels constrict and blood pressure increases.</p>
<p>11. Effects of Cold Water Baths: During cold water baths, blood vessels constrict and blood pressure rises noticeably. After the bath, skin blood vessels reflexively dilate, and blood pressure decreases again.</p>
<p>12. Effects of Warm Baths: Initially, blood vessels constrict due to warm water stimulation, causing blood pressure to rise. Later, blood vessels dilate, and blood pressure decreases again.</p>
<p>13. Effects of Menstruation: Women with heavy menstrual flow may experience a temporary decrease in blood pressure of 15 millimeters of mercury.</p>
<p>14. Effects of Disease: Blood pressure increases significantly in cases of nephritis, atrophic kidney, and arteriosclerosis.</p>
<h3>Dietary Nourishment and Hygiene in Medicine</h3>
<p>— Ye Jun</p>
<p>From the moment a person is born, drinking mother's milk as an infant and gradually eating porridge, gruel, rice, bread, wheat cakes, and other adult foods, food is indispensable every day of one's life. Therefore, the issue of food and human life is of great importance.</p>
<p>Those who eat meat and exercise little will inevitably become obese. Obesity is a disease caused by insufficient vegetables and a lack of exercise. Those who labor physically or mentally but lack food will inevitably become emaciated. Emaciation is caused by a failure to choose nutritious and inexpensive foods like beans. In my clinical practice, I often find it strange that people put their useful bodies in an unhealthy state. This state is partly due to environmental factors, but also because individuals do not pay attention to the nutritional foods from which their resources and strength come. Instead, they leave everything to illiterate cooks, considering fried and braised dishes as delicacies. This is truly lamentable. Anyone who has studied chemistry knows that in addition to protein, fats, and carbohydrates, humans also need various vitamins, which are essential for life. These vitamins decompose into waste products when exposed to high heat. I dare not advocate semi-cooked food in a society lacking knowledge of bacteriology, but I hope that people will consider the nutritional foods that their bodies need and not blindly regard delicacies as treasures, thereby wasting nature's gifts and placing excessive strain on their stomachs without benefiting their health. Sometimes, pickled vegetables and light meats like white fish can be nourishing. This is the first point.</p>
<p>The amount of food should be adjusted according to individual physique, labor, mental activity, exercise, etc. However, the distribution of three meals a day should follow the table below:</p>
<p>(1) For breakfast in the morning, it is best to take some liquid and thin items. The reason is that the intestines and stomach have rested for several hours, and adding a large amount of solid food at once will harm digestion. Wealthy families can drink a glass of milk, two eggs, and several slices of bread, which is enough. Economical families can prepare a small stone mill to grind soybeans soaked overnight into soy milk. Use a piece of white cloth to filter the juice for breakfast. It is fresher and better than what you buy. The remaining residue can be stir-fried with bamboo shoots and green vegetables for lunch. It can be eaten for a long time without getting tired of it.</p>
<p>(2) Lunch can be slightly more substantial. Pork, beef, tomatoes, and vegetables are the best dishes to eat with rice. Hygienic rice (i.e., brown rice, because vitamin B exists in it) is the standard. Refined rice only contains carbohydrates. If eaten for a long time without supplementing with other foods containing vitamins, it will inevitably lead to a sallow complexion and thin muscles, or even cause beriberi, leading to heart failure and death. This is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>(3) Dinner should be no more than full. There is an old saying that goes, "Eat less at night, live to ninety-nine." If dinner is too full, it will inevitably tire the stomach and intestines, or even cause the stomach to become weak and sluggish, causing food to remain in the gastrointestinal tract and ferment into toxins. Those who suffer from this will have bad breath and will not be able to get up early, affecting their work during the day, feeling tired and listless.</p>
<p>Now, if the daily adult food intake is two jin [unit of weight], the distribution is as follows:</p>
<p>Breakfast: 6 taels 4 qian [unit of weight]</p>
<p>Lunch: 16 taels</p>
<p>Dinner: 9 taels 6 qian</p>
<p>Attention should be paid to the quality and quantity of food for individual nutrition. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Each person's life, environment, and physique are different. If people are forced to eat a certain amount of meat or fish, monks and nuns will be at a loss. Monks and nuns can also enjoy longevity and health by eating vegetarian food for life. However, from a medical point of view, the distribution of our food should include fats, proteins, carbohydrates, chlorophyll, vitamins, and inorganic salts in appropriate and balanced amounts, as the only way to health and strength. A table is listed below:</p>
<p>Protein: 20%</p>
<p>Fats: 4%</p>
<p>Carbohydrates: 70%</p>
<p>Chlorophyll and fiber: 5%</p>
<p>Inorganic salts: 1%</p>
<p>Vitamins: Rich in content</p>
<p>Now, examples are given below for comparison.</p>
<p>Beef, chicken, mutton, pork, fish, etc.: 7 taels 2 qian</p>
<p>Scallions, radishes, bamboo shoots, celery, taro, potatoes, arrowhead, cucumbers, eggplants, spinach, cabbage, lotus root, tofu, lentils, peas, broad beans, etc.: 2 taels 5 qian</p>
<p>Half a pound of milk or two eggs</p>
<p>White rice, bread, steamed buns, wheat cakes, etc.: 22 taels</p>
<p>However, only upper-class families can enjoy this. For ordinary people, tofu replaces meat, pickled vegetables replace vegetables, and soy milk replaces milk and eggs. During the difficult days of resistance against Japan, it is already fortunate to have this much. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Common Sense of Dietary Nourishment</p>
<h3>Scientific Research on Dietary Nourishment (Continued from Issue 14)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhenyu</p>
<p>(2) Application of Dietary Nourishment</p>
<p>Since life depends on dietary nourishment, how can its application be ignored without scientific research? Science means that all problems of dietary nourishment, large and small, have evidence to clarify their principles. It is not like the research of ancient people, which was mostly idealistic or abstract. Although there were some that conformed to experiments, they could not be fully believed. Here, the results of scientific research are stated below.</p>
<p>What is dietary nourishment? It is the driving force of the human body. All operations of the human body, moving internally and expressed externally, are manifestations of life. Therefore, where there is life, there must be operation, and where there is operation, there must be dietary nourishment. The relationship between operation and dietary nourishment is close and inseparable, which goes without saying. Moreover, operation is continuous in time, so the supply of driving force must also be continuous. The creation of driving force is like the engine and boiler in a machine factory. Water is placed in the boiler and burned with coal. The water is heated and vaporized, generating force (Energy), which is guided to various parts of the engine, driving the branches and bodies to generate various useful operations, which we utilize to become the most powerful part of industry. Food, from the mouth to the stomach and intestines, undergoes digestion, transforming into a special quality suitable for the human body, which is absorbed by the blood and transported to the muscle systems of various parts of the body. When it encounters oxygen (Oxygen), it generates a chronic combustion called oxidation (Oxidation), keeping the whole body warm and operational without interruption. The boiler is like the human stomach and intestines. Coal and water are like human food. Coal is incinerated, heating the water in the boiler. When the water is heated to a considerable degree, it vaporizes, and the vapor can drive the engine, causing operation. Food combines with oxygen to form oxidation, which is not much different from combustion, except for the difference in speed.</p>
<p>The operation of various parts of the engine is like the operation of various parts of the human body. The ability of the engine to operate (Energy) can be measured, and the ability of the human body to operate can also be measured. For convenience, the value of the amount of heat is used as a unit for the ability to operate, called calorie (Calorie). Calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one kilogram (one kilogram) of water by one degree on a centigrade scale, or the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of four pounds of water by one degree on a Celsius scale. In the study of dietary nourishment, the calorie used is mostly one-thousandth of a Calorie. In other words, the calorie used is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram (one centimeter) of water by one degree on a centigrade scale. In science, uppercase and lowercase versions of the letter C are used to indicate the difference. After food is oxidized, it is applied to the human body, and its application function is called metabolism (Metabolism), which will be discussed in a separate article and will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>The source of heat can be traced back to sunlight. The amount of sunlight that the human body can directly use is small, and the amount it uses indirectly is large and mediated by food. Most foods are plants and animals, and the life of plants and animals depends on sunlight. For example, plants can combine the simplest substances, such as the carbon dioxide (CO2) gas exhaled by animals, with water to form a complex organic substance. Its combination must go through a chemical functional effect in the plant body, and the progress of this effect must have sunlight as its driving force. The plant must have chlorophyll as its catalyzer (Catalyzer). Sunlight is applied by the catalyzer to promote the combination of carbon dioxide and water to form carbohydrates (Carbohydrate). Here is a list of its chemical formulas to clarify it: (To be continued)</p>

<h3>An Attempt</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>In the past, people said, "There has never been a successful attempt since ancient times," but Hu Shi said, "Success has always been in attempts." Will attempts ultimately succeed? I am not a relativist, but I have a relative view of attempts: some attempts will succeed, and some will never succeed.</p>
<p>After twenty-two months of resistance against Japan, China is attempting a counter-offensive. This attempt is certain to succeed. We see the news from these past two or three weeks. Since the counter-offensive was attempted, there have been numerous achievements that have shaken our ears and eyes. The most prominent examples are the two recoveries of Kaifeng, the repeated victories in northern Jiangxi, the annihilation of tens of thousands of enemy soldiers, and the tightening siege of Guangzhou, which seems poised to fall in one fell swoop. Based on this, if one day the enemy is exhausted and we launch a general counter-offensive with our well-rested elite forces, how could they not collapse at the mere sight of us? Although the enemy can still hold out for now, and we are not yet fully prepared, we are only testing their strength, but the certainty of final victory has increased significantly. Success is in the attempt, which is inevitable here.</p>
<p>But at the same time, they are also attempting something. They are attempting to seek peace. This attempt is certain to fail. They are in a situation where they have mounted a tiger and cannot dismount, so they can only repeatedly release the air of seeking peace as an attempt. Recently, they have even entrusted a third country to mediate peace. However, they are still singing the praises of the East Asian New Order and still dreaming of being the masters of East Asia. In other words, they still have not regretted their evil deeds and abandoned their aggression. Such peace-seeking is not asking us to surrender to them? Using peace-seeking as a means, and demanding our surrender as the goal, this attempt is simply going south while heading north, how can it work? The unsuccessful attempt will naturally become an irreversible ironclad case.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that reasonable and planned attempts, such as engaging in inventions for civil service exams, will succeed. Absurd, irrational, and reckless attempts, such as speculation or gambling, will not succeed. Our counter-offensive attempt belongs to the former, which everyone knows. Their peace-seeking attempt belongs to the latter, which even elementary school students know. Who will succeed and who will not succeed can be understood early on without waiting for the final result.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can add a sentence: "Success in attempts lies in reason and justice."</p>
<h3>Bombing</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>——Memories of the Breakthrough from Xuzhou</p>
<p>Having suffered from fever rashes all night, shouldering a mortar shell, I followed the team through the dead city of Xuzhou and broke through the enemy's encirclement. In the slow-rising yellow and gray smoke, we kept walking urgently. The night slowly changed from dark gray to light gray, and all the villages, trees, and wheat seedlings that had been swallowed by darkness slowly and dimly appeared. Several sleepless stars in the sky weakly half-closed their eyes, and the morning breeze lightly slipped past the wheat tips. Attacked by sleep, but still weakly active like some kind of machine, the people seemed to have the clouds that covered their consciousness torn away, and suddenly woke up. The body that was about to collapse due to fatigue seemed to be supported by something, and felt firm. Only the two painful feet, blistered and blistering again, seemed to be tied to lead weights, making it impossible to drag them!</p>
<p>In the gray and vast sky, where the night had not completely faded, a plane suddenly appeared. Hearing the loud engine sound, the advancing team hurriedly scattered and lay down in the wheat field.</p>
<p>Lying comfortably in the wheat field, watching the plane, whether it was the enemy's or our own, draw an arc low in the dim sky and fly away, the scattered people and horses then merged into a torrent again, rolling forward.</p>
<p>The night had completely faded, and the sun, with a red face, slowly rose from the forest in the east. Intolerable hunger and thirst made many people fall behind. But the team in front didn't seem to care, and continued to advance.</p>
<p>Enemy planes, in twos and threes, kept soaring in the sky. Seeing some straggling brothers, scattered and walking in the fields, they didn't care at all until it flew over their heads, then they went to the wheat field and lay down. Looking at the golden light shining in the sun, which was only wasting gasoline, I couldn't help but whisper: "See what you can do?"</p>
<p>Harassed by enemy planes all the way, after suffering until after ten o'clock, we finally arrived at the encampment - Xu San Village.</p>
<p>This was a small village of about thirty or forty households, but almost all the people had fled. After finding an empty house that the comrades had chosen in advance, I ignored the yellow dust all over my body and rolled onto a bed in a room with two comrades to sleep.</p>
<p>My eyelids, which hadn't closed for two nights, had just closed and entered the sweet dreamland. I was awakened by a rough sound, the sound was so heavy and chaotic, it was clear that at least three heavy bombers had arrived overhead. But experience seemed to tell us: we can't run, so we calmly stayed lying down, covered with a gray blanket. The people in the house who were talking about something suddenly fell silent. Everyone's heart seemed to feel a kind of pressure, and the air in the house became very tense, as if some kind of unfortunate disaster was about to come. But we silently just waited, waited for the disaster to come!</p>
<p>The humming sound was getting closer and closer, more and more frightening, as if it was about to land on our roof, when suddenly a shocking and huge sound rang out:</p>
<p>——WHOOSH!</p>
<p>Like an earthquake, the house was shaking, and yellow dust fell from the walls and ceiling, flying upward again. The house was full of yellow dust, making it impossible to open our eyes, and the bomb fragments howled as they flew into the house, but splashed on the walls.</p>
<p>The people in the house, as if they had lost consciousness, were lost in the yellow dust, unable to breathe, when a series of shocking explosions rang out again:</p>
<p>——WHOOSH! WHOOSH! WHOOSH!…………</p>
<p>The house was shaking again as if having a fever, the bomb fragments were howling mournfully in the yellow dust, we covered our heads under the gray blanket, feeling a little numb in our mouths, and thought in our hearts: we are definitely going to die today!</p>
<p>But I don't know how, after more than half an hour of bombing, we were still alive. After the enemy plane dropped its bombs, it circled overhead for a while and flew away triumphantly. We ran out of the house, under the threat of death, and looked around: the enemy plane's bombs had dug several large holes in the threshing ground outside the house, and several empty houses made of sorghum stalks nearby had been shaken down by the bombs. But the house we were staying in was not damaged at all.……</p>
<p>"The ×× imperialists are really bored! Their bombs are probably free, you see, they bombed these things!"</p>
<p>"If the people in their country knew that their hard-earned money was being wasted on our land and branches, I wonder how painful they would feel!"</p>
<p>"It's not enough to just feel pain, they have to rise up and oppose it!"</p>
<p>The enemy plane flew back, so we hurriedly scattered and lay down under the shade of the trees on the riverbank, letting it bomb again!</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Please do not make the submitted drawings too narrow and long. Ideally, the height should be 3 inches and the width 3 to 4 inches. In any case, please do not make it narrower and longer than a height of 3 inches and a width of 2 inches.</p>
<p>We welcome suitable translated manuscripts. However, due to the volume of submissions, a certain translated manuscript submitted a few days earlier might be published after the same translated manuscript has appeared in other publications. This would lead readers to suspect that the manuscript was submitted to multiple publications or was a rehash of another manuscript. Therefore, please: (1) submit translated manuscripts promptly; (2) state when submitting that if it is not published within a few days, it will be submitted elsewhere; (3) indicate the source publication of the translation. At the same time, this publication will also do its best to publish earlier. We sincerely hope for mutual cooperation to improve things as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Anti-Aggression League</h3>
<h3>The Song of the Dragons</h3>
<p>— Wall Creeper</p>
<p>On a starless dusk, amidst the bustling sounds of orchestra and the flushed faces of revelry, I left the inevitable end of a banquet and trudged alone to this desolate corner.</p>
<p>Abandoned by the blessed, this desolate corner!</p>
<p>Miserably, sparse groups of people, like ghosts, moved silently.</p>
<p>(In the distance, on the dark plains, sinister demons guard the night!)</p>
<p>Suddenly, a magnificent and stirring song burst forth from the long, broad wall enclosure there, interwoven with anger and valor.</p>
<p>A shadow crossed my heart:</p>
<p>I remembered that behind this wall were locked eight hundred dragons! They had a glorious and immortal history! Now, they possessed only soaring spirit, yet were deprived of freedom, burdened with shackles!</p>
<p>They hibernated in lonely days, and a fervent patriotism, along with accusations against the enemy, naturally erupted into song, broadcast into the night sky.</p>
<p>Oh, magnificent and stirring song! You trembled the darkness! You trembled the universe!</p>
<p>My heart pounded even more with the surging rhythm!</p>
<h3>The Art of Pushing</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>"The frost on his roof," it's okay to "ignore," that's being smart. However, "the snow in front of your own door" still needs "to be swept," and that's actually hard work. So, not sweeping isn't good either, so what to do? Well, you can "push" it, push it onto someone else; if you don't know how to push, then you might as well learn.</p>
<p>There are many ways to push: For example, if there's a house across the way, you can openly and legitimately announce to them that this snow is in front of their door, and they should sweep it. If there isn't a house across the way, you can also righteously tell the neighbors on the left and right that this snow is near them, and they should sweep it. If there aren't any neighbors to the left or right, you can even more seriously tell the passersby that this snow is on the path they are walking on, and they should sweep it. If you can take it a step further and prove that the snow fell because of these people, then you're even more justified in asking them to sweep it, making them unable to refuse. If you can reach the final step, proving that the snow was either brought down by them or brought from somewhere else, then you can even more effortlessly tell them to sweep it clean, achieving great success. Even if they die from sweeping, they can only die without complaint.</p>
<p>This method, pushing it onto others, shifting the blame, the mistakes, all the bad luck, the losses, and the unfortunate things, onto others, while you, light and carefree, enjoy the fruits of their labor, how wonderful! Nowadays, many big shots with great careers, high positions, widespread reputations, abundant wealth, and strong influence, whether in politics, culture, business, or any field, have reached their current position largely because they have mastered the art of pushing.</p>
<p>When something comes into their hands, eyes, or minds, they never do it immediately. The first step is to see if it benefits them. If it doesn't, they push it. They spare no brainpower, effort, or energy to push this matter onto someone else, saying that it is not their responsibility. Even if it only takes a little brainpower, effort, or energy to accomplish, they are unwilling to do it; they still want to push it.</p>
<p>Of course, they weren't born knowing how to push; they learned it. Perhaps at first, they couldn't get things done without pushing, they couldn't "swallow more than they could chew." They learned from this lesson and, being ambitious to achieve success, they had no choice but to learn, to learn this pushing. Over time, it became a habit, and they used pushing in everything, and it always worked.</p>
<p>However, unexpected things always happen: What if there is snow in front of the door, covering the ground, but there isn't even a single person to push it onto? Is it really going to force His Majesty to personally sweep it? Well, you can still push it, push it onto a nonexistent person, Mr. Nobody, Mr. Emptiness. In other words, everything requires investment, and it's never worth it. Since no one can be blamed for this snow, it's okay to leave it there, ignore it, or pretend not to see it, letting it melt on its own or letting it freeze there. If you say the front door is inconvenient to walk through, you can always go around to the back door; if there's snow at the back door too, you can go through the side door, the transverse door, the side door, or the auxiliary door; there are many doors. You'd rather put more effort into going around than put less effort into sweeping, because sweeping means losing dignity, changing a consistent policy, and breaking the non-sweeping principle. Even if your shoes get wet and you slip, you still don't sweep, implementing your pushing.</p>
<p>This kind of pushing, applied to everything, is procrastination. Today you push it to tomorrow, and tomorrow you push it to tomorrow, and so on. If a bad thing turns into a small thing because of this pushing, and a small thing turns into nothing, then the pusher can congratulate himself on having foresight, thus avoiding disaster. If the pushing turns nothing into a small thing, a small thing into a big thing, and the big thing is also unfavorable, then you can always say that pushing is already like this, so what would it be like if you didn't push? Anyway, there are always reasons, and you can always push.</p>
<p>This kind of pushing cannot be achieved overnight; it also needs to be learned. Once learned, its mysteries are endless: it can keep you away from disaster and turn bad luck into good fortune; at the very least, even if there's no success, there's no failure either!</p>
<p>The first type of pushing is the "live" push that you can get rid of, and the second type is the "dead" push that you can't get rid of. Using both together, the art of pushing is practically complete.</p>
<p>Finally, we remember that there is also the push of "Confucius declined due to illness," which must also be learned. This means telling lies, fabricating stories, shirking responsibility, and deceiving people without paying for it. When poor friends come to see you, you must pretend you're not home; when you need to join the army, you must pretend to have disabilities; when you need to donate money, you must pretend to be poor; when you need to participate in patriotic movements, you must pretend you don't have time; when you have a prior appointment, you must pretend that there was no such thing; when bending over in a melon patch, you must pretend you're putting on your shoes; when reaching for plums under a tree, you must pretend you're adjusting your hat;... Once this push is learned, it becomes the culmination of the art of pushing, comparable to Confucius, the most sage in pushing!</p>
<p>However, it is common for there to be no one to push onto, or to push a cart into a wall, resulting in a broken head and bleeding, so it seems like some caution is needed.</p>

<h3>"Candy" and "Whip"</h3>
<p>— Yin Sanlang</p>
<p>According to reports, fascist countries consistently use the "candy" and "whip" policy.</p>
<p>"Candy" and "whip" seem to be contradictory terms, but in reality, if we observe the current world situation and are not too forgetful, we will definitely feel that the so-called "candy" and "whip" are indeed very connected.</p>
<p>Opening the newspapers of the past six months, they are filled with many great deeds related to "candy" and "whip." Isn't that right? Small and weak countries in Eastern Europe, such as Czechoslovakia, Albania, and Spain, have all suffered the pain of the "whip" under the temptation of "candy."</p>
<p>Fascist countries, relying on their weapons, are constantly trying to seize and plunder, gaining some advantages. But humanity has innate ingenuity and intelligence. Thus, if fascist aggressors are coveting something, the first step will never be to reveal their original hideous faces. They must steal the old trick of deceiving adults and children alike, using "candy" to lure it. Thus, first, the two sides sign some economic agreement or military agreement, so that a small and weak country, in a state of hesitation and consideration, feels very comfortable hearing it. Once the first step of the "candy" plan is successful, the original evil face is revealed step by step. By the time they realize they have been tricked, and want to change their course, it is too late. They have already tasted the most poisonous taste of the "whip."</p>
<p>Although the universe is vast, the principles are the same. Let us take a closer look at the fascist allies in the Far East. Are they not playing the same trick? Before the "July 7th" Incident, they always consistently offered us "candy" in the form of "Sino-Japanese friendship," "economic cooperation," and "coexistence and co-prosperity." At the time, we really felt like "refusing it would be disrespectful, accepting it would be painful."</p>
<p>Now, using the "whip" to intensify the beating, and revealing its true form today, it is still distributing those delicious "candies" in the occupied areas. What "establishing a new order in East Asia" and "reviving new China" are all despicable tricks to deceive adults and children. What is regrettable is that there are absolutely no complete fools in the world who will forever eat their "candy" without feeling the bitterness.</p>
<p>Now, those who have eaten their "candy" and tasted the "whip" have all understood and have also tightly raised the "righteous whip" in their hands to resist the "unreasonable whip" of the invaders. Moreover, I believe that in the near future, there will be a day when the "righteous whip" will shatter the "tyrannical whip!"</p>
<h3>Beware of Poisoned Apples</h3>
<p>— Zhou Guangzuo</p>
<h3>Sketch of General Zhao Dong</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yizhi</p>
<p>The young General Zhao Dong, he abandoned civil engineering and led guerrilla forces to resist the Japanese army. Therefore, his enemy has offered a reward of 100,000 yuan for his head, but he still carries it with him, traveling in danger. (Continued)</p>
<p>When the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident occurred in 1937, and the Japanese army wanted to give China a "fatal blow," General Zhao saw the opportunity he had been waiting for. He secretly transported the munitions he had previously collected very secretly to a Chinese university outside Beiping City. At the time, his sixty-three-year-old mother—who is now the nationally renowned "Mother of Chinese Guerrillas," Old Mrs. Zhao—and his young sister also participated in the matter. On July 22nd, they rose up to resist the Japanese army. There were only twenty-four people in total, and Zhao Dong was elected as their leader. At the end of July that year, Beiping fell, and hundreds of Chinese university students from Beiping withdrew into the mountains, where they expanded Zhao Dong's ranks. At that time, the value of Zhao Dong's head increased from 3,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The brave soldiers led by General Zhao Dong were called the "North China People's Anti-Japanese Army." They assisted the Chinese regular army in fighting the Japanese army in North China, engaging in more than sixty battles, large and small. Their strategy, like that of guerrilla forces elsewhere in China, was to exchange minimal costs for greater victories, attacking small Japanese garrisons or Japanese transport teams. Recently, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers have died at their hands, and about two hundred and thirty military vehicles have been destroyed or captured by them.</p>
<p>The brave soldiers of General Zhao Dong often refer to the Japanese army's cargo trucks as "tax-paying porters." Now, many of them use Japanese rifles and wear Japanese army coats. Once, they intercepted a large quantity of Japanese canned food. That night, they held a grand banquet to celebrate the final victory of China.</p>
<p>Zhao Dong's monthly salary is only five yuan, but in the Japanese side's eyes, he is worth 100,000 yuan—six years ago, he was only worth 3,000 yuan. In August of last year, a spy hired by the Japanese army somehow infiltrated General Zhao's ranks. He was quickly discovered by his comrades. So he—this spy—confessed. It turned out that he had already received 5,000 yuan from the Japanese army, and after he successfully killed General Zhao to report his accomplishment, he could receive a check for 50,000 yuan. Naturally, he did not get the last check, and instead his life was lost.</p>
<p>Zhao Dong's subordinates are very loyal to their leader; they are all native peasants from the eight counties of Pingxi. Some of them were driven from their hometowns by the Japanese army, and most of their female relatives were systematically insulted by the invaders. Now, their main plan is to use propaganda and other political work to encourage and organize their compatriots.</p>
<p>What kind of damage have Zhao's troops inflicted on the Japanese army in southern Manchuria and the suburbs of Beiping? In Manchuria, in seven years, they killed more than 4,000 Japanese soldiers and captured 3,000 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. In North China, since July 22, 1937, they have killed more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers and captured 2,000 rifles, 50 machine guns, and a large amount of ammunition. These munitions and military supplies are now used to return the favor to their original owners.</p>
<p>Until January 1939, the Japanese army had sent "punitive expeditions" to "exterminate" General Zhao Dong's troops no less than six times. The most severe of these was in October of last year. The Japanese side mobilized three brigades, carrying heavy artillery, to attack Mao Feng Mountain (transliteration)—one of the peaks of the West Mountains—the guerrilla headquarters. In addition, eleven bombers dropped bombs over the mountain peak to aid in the battle. This battle lasted for two days and one night. When the Japanese army climbed the mountain peak, they discovered that the Chinese guerrilla forces had completely withdrawn, and had also taken everything with them when they withdrew. How frustrating and disappointing! They also inspected the bodies of Chinese guerrilla forces on the mountain and found only thirty-four; while they themselves had lost more than three hundred.</p>
<p>Humble, honest, and polite, General Zhao Dong gave visitors a very good impression in Chongqing. Whenever he talked to people, he always talked about: "Resisting Japan!" and "Guerrilla warfare!" His pair of long-lashed eyes, combined with black and thick eyebrows, shone powerfully. He is one of China's bravest fighters.</p>
<p>Soon, General Zhao will return to his brothers in Beiping. According to his current plan, when he returns to Pingxi, he will give the Japanese army a large-scale blow.</p>

<h3>Guide Brokers</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ying</p>
<p>Since the rapid rise of guide agencies like mushrooms after rain, guide brokers, which are associated with guide agencies, are also one of them. Especially since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, industry and commerce have declined, and the number of unemployed people has increased significantly. Driven by the need to make a living, the number of people taking this path is also increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am also one of those who have taken this path for a living, wasting time, and it has been three months already. Guide agencies in China are originally a disguised form of certain transactions, which is a public fact. What kind of work is a guide broker? Readers can easily explore and find out. Such a humble profession that is meaningless to the social public, how ashamed and worthless I feel when I hold my pen to write these words!</p>
<p>The working hours of a guide broker are generally after six or seven o'clock in the afternoon, when the lights come on and activity gradually begins. Hotels and restaurants are the best destinations. Every larger tavern and inn has our footprints. The tools of the trade are a photo album of guide girls and some promotional advertisements for guide agencies. Otherwise, like brokers in other professions, we rely on eloquent tongues to solicit customers and earn meager profits. Working hours usually last until at least midnight. Some extend their working hours even longer to increase their income slightly. Such all-night leg pain, eye strain, and lip fatigue, if you're lucky, you might earn close to a yuan, but sometimes, if the timing is bad, "eating tangyuan" is also common. Life is also pitiful and distressing. Since the Public Works Department banned guide brokers, major hotels have also followed suit in banning them from entering, which is an even more fatal blow to guide brokers.</p>
<p>Because guide agencies are dens of decadence, and guide brokers usually don't have much to do during the day, the temptation of the environment often makes it difficult to avoid going with the flow. The money earned so hard is either gambled away or used to lavishly spend time and play with guide girls. It may be excusable to live this humble life temporarily driven by economic forces, but to be trapped in the pit of depravity and not know how to extricate oneself is even more sinful. Those who are currently engaged in this profession should be aware of this!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Clear Skies</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Is it Illusion or Reality, Acting on Stage; Should One Proceed or Stop, Making a Home Anywhere</p>
<p>In addition to this automobile manufacturing company, Mrs. Suria also had a family car rental company, which was a unique idea. It involved creating a car that was perfectly suited for family use and renting it out for travel. This venture also succeeded as a joke. Originally, when Mrs. Suria first came to Shanghai, Jin Danyu was also the one who entertained her. Jin Danyu drove her around everywhere, taking her to various places to play. Mrs. Suria didn't like riding in small cars, but preferred spacious cars because she was plump and double-sized. When Yu Danyu accompanied her on outings, she often fell asleep in the car on warm and sunny days. Jin Danyu laughed and said, "A car that you can sit, lie down, read, and write in would be really convenient." Mrs. Suria said, "We have many of those kinds of cars in America; they're called 'mobile homes.' Many engineers, as they please, have manufactured those kinds of cars. I've seen a few myself, but some are suitable for winter but not for summer, and some are suitable for summer but not for winter. Some are suitable for waterside forests, and some are suitable for mountain villages with ancient temples. They design them according to their own preferences, just to use them for travel, so there are bound to be some shortcomings. I have a friend who once brought one to China, and he said that this kind of 'mobile home' is most suitable for China because China is a large place, especially with many scenic spots. In recent years, highways have been opened everywhere, and that kind of car, like a small family, can be driven anywhere. I said that kind of car can not only be used for sightseeing, but can also be needed for all kinds of construction and academic work, and will definitely be popular in the future." Jin Danyu said, "Why would that kind of car be needed for construction and academic work?" Mrs. Suria said, "For example, if there are many projects in deep mountains and remote valleys, the supervisors and designers have to follow their projects. Today they are here, and tomorrow they are there; they cannot have a fixed place to live. In the past, those who handled projects would build crude houses on the spot, which would be demolished after the project was completed. But it always felt fixed and clumsy. With that kind of mobile home, as long as there is a road, they can drive here today and drive there tomorrow, wouldn't that be convenient? As for those who study academic subjects, there are now many subjects that cannot be invented by closing themselves in a small room and thinking deeply. They must explore and pursue in various places, even to places where people rarely tread. As your Chinese say, 'Building a hut in an uninhabited place,' you can't say that kind of car is not beneficial to learning." (95)</p>

<h3>New Talk on the Opera Scene</h3>
<p>— She Weng</p>
<p>The play "Si Lang Visits His Mother" has been popular for a long time and is a must-learn for amateur performers, so it has value for research. However, there are two styles for Si Lang's acceptance of the princess's command flag: one is to hide the flag behind the waist, which is the old way, as Lao Tan did. The other is to insert it next to the neck, just to make the style look good. Fu Ying did not follow the old style, but improved it for his grandfather.</p>
<p>Mao Shilai gained fame in the north and south for performing shrewish plays in his childhood. Although he has not yet reached the most seasoned stage, he is already regarded as Little Cuihua. I believe that the broader scope of Dan roles is in the boudoir style. If he inclines towards the shrewish aspect, it will inevitably affect the development of other aspects. I alone expect him to be Little Xun Huisheng for this reason.</p>
<p>Yesterday I watched Zhang Eyun perform Xun Huisheng's play "Wood Hairpin and Phoenix Ming." The singing was quite good, and there were places where the tune was easily changed. The expression was insufficient, even if you don't compare it with Liu Xiang, it seems that his spirit was not concentrated. It is very difficult to perform other people's scripts, and the saying that the script must match the personality of the performer is even more credible.</p>
<p>Friends all praise Yan Shishan's appearance and martial arts as beautiful. Yesterday I just got to see his "Tide Gold Top," and it was indeed excellent. I heard that he can also do Dao Ma Hua Dan types of plays. He is a versatile talent among the rising stars, which is rare and valuable. His age is in the golden age, and the theaters should regard him as a golden figure and let him display his talents more, not bury a hero in a useful place, which is also what the art appreciators sympathize with.</p>
<h3>Behind the Scenes of the "Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting Through the Ages"</h3>
<p>— Xu Bangda</p>
<p>The initial initiators of the "Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting Through the Ages" were Mr. Ding Huikang, Wu Hufan, and Liu Haisu. Everyone probably already knows their intentions and purposes. Regarding the exhibits, collection, and display, I would like to announce to the gentlemen who have enthusiastically supported and actively visited. In addition to me, Mr. Pan Chuanshan is also responsible for the display work. Mr. Pan is a scholar who is well-versed in art and literature, and is also a collector and calligrapher and painter. Therefore, the layout of this venue really benefited greatly from Mr. Pan's contributions. In addition, Sun Boyuan, Cao Youqing, Xiang Shude, and the brothers Wu Binchen and Bicheng were all running around together. I was just following and assisting. The request for exhibits this time was made by several standing committee members of the association separately contacting their friends, and there was no public solicitation. Who knew that the result after collection was beyond expectations, with a total of more than four hundred pieces. It can be seen how enthusiastically the collectors supported us, which is really very grateful. However, the venue is always too small and cannot be displayed all at once, which is unavoidable.</p>
<p>The first display consisted of one hundred and thirty-three pieces and was exhibited for five days. When it was changed for the second time, because there were relatively fewer precious paintings from the Yuan Dynasty, several were retained. Among the Ming and Qing Dynasties, except for a few very important pieces that were not repeated among the exhibits, only a few could be left, and more than nine out of ten were replaced with new ones. This added nearly a hundred more pieces; however, there were still more than one hundred pieces left. Originally, we wanted to only change it once, but it seems that it can't be done this way. So, at the dinner of the standing committee on the 19th, it was publicly agreed to change everything again on the 23rd. This way, we can finally see all the exhibits received. However, because the days are too tight, we can only display it for two days, which is very regrettable.</p>
<p>As for the order of hanging, it is entirely based on the needs and capacity of the venue. The first, second, and third times were completely without prejudice, with the goal of hanging everything.</p>
<p>We believe that the preservation of the exhibits this time is very thorough. In the venue, the hanging paintings are separated by wooden railings; the scrolls are covered with glass cabinets, so they will certainly not be damaged or soiled. Even when they are taken down, each painting is wiped and then wrapped in kraft paper. Fortunately, the helpful Mr. Sun and Mr. Cao are all experts in calligraphy and painting, and are very skilled at rolling and unrolling them, so there is no risk of bending or creasing them. This can be a comfort to all the exhibitors.</p>
<p>Finally, we must state one very important thing, that is, the exhibits displayed this time are hung as long as they arrive, without any selection. The authenticity, beauty, and ugliness of them are to be distinguished and judged by the visiting gentlemen themselves. Because Mr. Pan and I only have the responsibility of displaying, not the authority of reviewing. If it is said that there are many good ones, that is the best. Or if it is said that they are not very satisfactory, then the one yuan ticket can be considered a donation to relieve the refugees. Gentlemen, you can probably forgive us.</p>
<h3>An Overview of the Erhu (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>Regarding Performance Techniques</p>
<p>The erhu's sound can be quite brash, but when used well, it can produce stirring tones. However, beginners can make it sound headache-inducing, and without three to five years of hard work, don't expect to produce pleasant sounds. (It's not like the VIOLIN, which has a beautiful inherent sound.) This is the first major hurdle. Moreover, there are many variations in technique. Regarding the right hand's pulling and releasing, one must differentiate well. Half bow, full bow, bow root, bow tip—each produces different results. The inner and outer strings should be relaxed and active. There are short strokes and tremolo bowing. (Similar to the flying staccato of the VIOLIN.) One must also push outwards and bring inwards, without any hint of roughness. These few points are already quite demanding. Regarding the left hand, this is about fingering. First, pressing should be neither too light nor too heavy, and at the same time, it should be determined by the weight of the bow. The fingers should be able to move up and down—first light, then heavy, first heavy, then light. Sometimes, the string is tapped lightly, and there is also the so-called vibrato, which is quite similar to the TRILL in Western music. However, it's used very often on the erhu, sometimes pronounced, sometimes subtle. The most troublesome part is in places where it shouldn't be added, people insist on adding it, causing endless suffering. All of the above are necessary conditions for perfect artistry. Even so, not everyone can achieve it. If one uses the lower position, it becomes even more troublesome. Without exquisite technique, sensitive hearing (i.e., auditory perception), and a calm demeanor, one cannot achieve satisfactory results. When starting to practice, it's best to adopt Sun Zuochen's methods because his are simpler; with a few months of effort, one can manage. The erhu rests on the lap and is too light, so when using the lower position, it's prone to instability. Therefore, when practicing the lower position, one must first stabilize it, or else it cannot be performed. Furthermore, there is the familiarity with the stage. Every play has a specific sequence, and one should have ample memorization beforehand; otherwise, one will freeze on stage, which insiders call a "black stage." Once familiar with the stage, then the speed and rhythm become a major issue. At the same time, one must harmonize with the singer and the stage. One cannot act solely according to one's subjective ideas, as that will lead to failure. As for the most important thing, one must be familiar with the melodies. Each role type—sheng, dan, jing, lai—has its own characteristics. Furthermore, even with the same old sheng role, the plays differ. Even if the plays are the same, the singing styles are different. These are all realms that those learning the erhu must pass through. One must be broad and proficient, and never harbor careless thoughts. One must strive for better within good to achieve excellence. To seek excellence within excellence is to achieve transformation. Often, some people look down on the erhu. I dare say they definitely cannot play it, and if they can, it's only in a very amateurish way. Naive people, of course, speak with blind criticism. If everyone had this mindset, then art would not be able to progress. The erhu's timbre is truly excellent; such a small instrument produces such a grand sound. However, the range of tones is too limited. If someone were to devote themselves to in-depth research, then naturally, there would be many more variations that could be created. If, because of its simplicity, one doesn't research it and claims without basis that the erhu has no value, then it's because one's own thinking is too simple. Consider the piano and violin in Western music today; they also reached their current status through the efforts of many people. If no one had improved them in the beginning, then wouldn't they still be mere musical toys?</p>

<h3>Biographies of Figures in Small Theaters (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Man Fu</p>
<p>Foreword</p>
<p>The Shanghai theatrical scene is trending towards "retro," as evidenced by the Golden, Carlton, and Cardo theaters' exclusive performances of old plays. Originally, Shanghai's theaters were called teahouses. Now, the upper floors of several teahouses are staging plays at night again. Due to the regulations of the Municipal Council, before the main play begins, a few "people from the singing profession" give a brief performance, awaiting the main play's entrance, euphemistically called "dress rehearsal." This has long restored the old look of the "teahouse" from thirty years ago, but now that everything emphasizes modernity, teahouses are called "small theaters." Looking around the "small theaters" of Shanghai, there are only three: "Xiao Guanghan," "Changle," and "Shidai." The highest ticket price is uniformly 3 jiao. I listen to songs every night, and based on what I have seen and heard, I am writing "Biographies of Figures in Small Theaters," but those who have left are not included.</p>
<p>The Xiao Guanghan Section</p>
<p>Xiao Guanghan is the first "small theater" in Shanghai. Because of its profitable business, Changle and Shidai followed. Almost all the actors at Changle and Shidai came from Xiao Guanghan. I will first describe Xiao Guanghan.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaolou and Wang Xiaofeng are both female performers who play old men's roles, excelling in both singing and acting. They have similar performance styles. The theater spares no expense, actually using double the star power. Jiang was a leading actor in both the Two Celebrities and Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou water route troupes, and is skilled in small-scale plays, such as "Life and Death Plank," "Prosperous Spring and Autumn," "A Blow of Snow," "The Legend of Chu-Han Heroes," etc., which are rare among female singers who play male roles.</p>
<p>Liu Qinxin, a disciple of Liu Yuqin, is known for her female roles, such as "Battle of Wancheng," "Mount Cuiping," "Pan Jinlian." Her performances are meticulous. All were personally taught by Liu Yuqin. Qinxin is the goddaughter of Mr. Xu Muyun, author of this newspaper's "Secrets of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital."</p>
<p>Xiao Wang Huchen is a female performer who plays male martial roles. She is the niece of the veteran actor Fan Chunlou and the beloved daughter of Fan Chunshan. She studied acting under Wang Huchen, hence her name. She has a handsome appearance, and her martial arts performances are fiery, making her a rising star among female martial artists.</p>
<p>Zhou Biyun came from Zhu Dongmei's Fengyi Kun troupe. She initially learned acting from Wang Ziyu, and later belonged to Yong'an Tianyunlou, playing female roles. She is known for her flirtatious roles. "Drum Dance" and "Changing Fortune Society" are quite watchable. Her appearance is very beautiful, and her craftsmanship is meticulous. It's a pity her singing is not clean, and her dialogue is more fluent and pleasing to the ear.</p>
<p>Wu Guifen is the backstage manager. When a performer is missing on stage, the backstage manager fills in. Wu was originally a famous actor, on par with Xiao Dazi. She sings any kind of play, and is a longtime figure at Xiao Guanghan.</p>
<p>Su Yunqiu, Wu Guifen's daughter, is better at Qingyi roles than Hua Dan roles. Still unmarried, the reason for her surname Su is unknown. Her voice and acting are good, but unfortunately, she is not good at makeup, so she has not become popular. She is the same Wu Cuiyun who received high praise at the Divine World Xianshi Amusement Park more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>Zhao You'an is a male performer who does both Jing and Chou roles. He is corpulent and has mediocre expressions. He should put in more effort.</p>

<h3>Special Announcement from the Entertainment Newsroom</h3>
<p>Since its inception, this publication has daily published Mr. Xu Muyun's "Secrets of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital." We are grateful for the praise from our esteemed readers. The author and the editors consider themselves extremely fortunate! In response to the demands of the majority of our readers, we plan to publish it as a standalone book. We are currently in the process of organizing, adding, and deleting as appropriate. Once ready, we will announce the pre-order. In the future, we will still ask Mr. Muyun to write "Pear Garden Anecdotes," about the forgotten stories and anecdotes in the Pear Garden, regardless of north or south, past or present; anything with value for commentary will be collected as much as possible. Mr. Xu is familiar with the lore of the Pear Garden and writes with a lively pen. It can be predicted that he will be supported by readers. "Pear Garden Anecdotes" will begin publication on May 1st. We hope our readers will pay attention.</p>

<h3>Earthquake in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(See this Newspaper from April of the 11th Year of Tongzhi of the Defunct Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>The other day, a friend spoke of an earthquake in Nanjing, which I suspected was a rumor and did not believe. Today, someone came from Nanjing, and I hastily inquired. I learned that there was indeed an earthquake around dusk the other day, lasting about the time it takes to eat a meal. Houses nearly collapsed, and on boats, teacups tilted, with some breaking. It is said that from Zhenjiang to Wuhu, for hundreds of miles up and down, there were earthquakes at the same time, but Suzhou and Songjiang did not feel it. Those who say that earthquakes are caused by disharmony in the earth's energy, and are unrelated to fortune or calamity.</p>
<h3>Coiled Dragon on the Water</h3>
<p>The other night, at half past nine, a Westerner was walking across the bridge and saw a large crowd of people leaning against the bridge posts and looking down, as if waiting for something. The Westerner did not understand what was happening and asked an old man by tugging on his sleeve. The old man said, "A divine dragon has appeared under the bridge! Its body is like a giant snake, coiled and motionless, probably waiting for the assistance of wind and thunder." At this time, the moonlight was bright, and the waves were clear. The Westerner looked but saw nothing, probably because his shoulders and back were crowded and blocked his view. Just as he was wondering, another Chinese person came, knowing the situation, and also wanted to get to the bottom of it. So they hired a small sampan boat and together rowed it under the bridge. From afar, they saw a dark shadow, but could not tell the head from the tail, nor whether it was a snake or a dragon. They insisted on seeing it up close and took a long boat pole, attaching a sharp blade to it, and stabbed it from the side. People on the bridge saw this and shouted loudly, thinking it was an offense to the divine dragon and absolutely unacceptable. They did not listen, and with a swing of their arm, the blade pierced it, and there was no sound. The object remained motionless. The people on the bridge shouted and clamored even louder, thinking that if it wagged its tail and stirred the waves, they would all be doomed. Afterwards, they slowly moved the boat to its side, used the pole to lift it up and examine it. It turned out to be a rotten bamboo basket, wrapped in a bamboo mat, and there was a broken giant rice stalk nearby, floating in the water, joined together. Seen from afar in the moonlight, it looked like a coiled dragon. Once they had examined it and saw the truth, the people on the bridge all laughed heartily, mocking their own misjudgment.</p>
