<p>社评</p>
<h3>迎五月</h3>
<p>五月一日之為勞動節、超越國界，超越階級成見，乃為世界所普遍承認，且普遍尊重之紀念日；行之中國，亦逾十載，或稱之曰「五一」。踵五一而繼至者，若「五三」「五四」「五七」「五九」「五卅」諸日，各有其家喻戶曉之歷史，既蔚為耳熟能詳之名辭；此外，更有五月五日焉、有五月十五日焉。蓋在此五月一月之間，在中國之所紀念者，或以革命，或以先烈，或以勞工運動，或以文化運動，或以慘案，或以國恥；自五一迄五卅，共有八端之多。雖不一其性質，不一其對象，然皆二十餘年間事也。五月在中國，洵特殊之季節哉。</p>
<p>溯念曩昔，在軍閥主政之日，統一未成之時；在上者，輒為此特殊季節而特別戒備，似憂患將與五月以俱至；在下者，每逢此特殊季節而特別活躍，似五月既挾希望而偕來。及今回想，固不惟所紀念之史實，歷歷如在目前；即每年每决紀念日之景象，或莊嚴，或陰森，或激昂，或紛擾，或忻慰，或慘痛，全旗半旗，集會遊行，標語口號，戒嚴解嚴，凡此形形色色者，又無不彷彿若昨夕事。即國民政府建都南京之初期，雖不復視此季節為恐懼，然猶嚴重視之。夫當局者何所憂患，何所恐懼？是無他，彼自知遠離民衆，拂逆輿情，斯不自安而戒備而已。迄去年五月，一反往年恐懼與嚴重之景象，大體有鬱勃之觀。</p>
<p>茲屆一九三九年特殊季節之始，我人將預言此季節之平安。蓋「五一」具有國際性，當然不以中國一國之遭遇而影響整個勞動節之意義；然勞動節最易觸發勞動界之衝動，此在各國儘有其可能，顧絕對不能想像之於今年今日之中國勞動界者也。至於「五三」以决，凡所紀念之史實，其主觀客觀之紀念價値，縱得一一比較而權衡之；然往年之人民，對於每一紀念日，不欲權衡紀念之價値而務必紀念之者，自有其故。析言之；對現實之不滿，演為各種方式之運動，求所以動搖現實，變更現實，修正現實，此其一。對社會之鼓動，喚醒之，號召之，推動之，組織之，此其二。對當局之示意，或怨憤而抨擊，或抑鬱而伸訴，或以熱誠擁護，或以善意鞭策，此其三。對外國之表見，以志仇恨之不忘，以示民氣之不可侮，以求國族之自由平等，此其四。無可致力，無可發洩、乃求一時之快意，此其五。此五者，各以各種性質之紀念日為機會者也。往年五月，緣是而多故，今年五月則不然。中國抗戰閱二十二月，所懸標的曰軍事第一，勝利第一；是不但抗戰之現實以外，無非决要之現實；卽以政府與社會言之，不容不承認為俱向所懸之標的而邁進。謂有不滿於抗戰而求動搖之，變更之，修正之者乎？謂有抨擊當局者乎？大難當前，惟竭實際之人力與物力，以赴之而已，謂待懸旗集曾文字語言以鋪張之乎？謂對現實之抗戰，猶無可致力，無可發洩，而致力發洩於紀念乎？對外國，謂有此抗戰更有力量之表見，有比抗戰更有效騐之表見乎？中國夙所自負之五千年歷史，當然有其不磨之價値；辛亥以後之一切，當然各有其歷史上之地位；然比之當前抗戰建國之為前後縱橫無可倫比之偉業，則五月間所應紀念之史實，無得而相提並論；退一步言之，今日之標的既為軍事第一，勝利第一，是即應意志集中，力量集中，則抗戰前所可紀念者，至少為抗戰時期所不暇紀念。云何不暇？埋頭致力於抗戰！迎五月而鋪張之以形式，謂非洩氣，至少非埋頭致力所必要也</p>

<h3>反侵略集團組織　英蘇談判急轉直下　德向波羅的海沿岸各國伸展勢力　蘇聯對拉特維亞愛沙尼亞提警告</h3>
<p>（倫敦）蘇聯駐英大使　邁斯基昨晚與英外相哈里法克期會談、據稱、席間邁氏曾提出建議、即英法兩國對於與蘇聯西雨邊境毗連之各國遭遇德國侵略時、應出兵保障此等國家之獨立、蘇聯所舉應予保障之國冢、波羅的海之拉脫維亞·愛沙尼亞·芬蘭亦包括在內、英法担負此種義務之後、則蘇聯願與英法訂立軍事同盟、凡遇德國侵略英法或英法所担保之各國時、蘇聯願出兵相助、聞於德國侵略比利士·荷蘭·瑞士時、蘇聯亦願與英法取共同行動、（三十日美聯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）右派巴黎迴聲報頃登載駐倫敦訪員來電稱、「蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基、昨與哈里法克斯外相所進行之談話、頗關重要、據聞該大使曾吿哈里法克斯外相云、蘇俄建議對於波羅的海沿岸各國、（立陶宛。拉脫維亞·愛沙尼亞三國）應設法保其安全、此項建議、現在已由波蘭在原則上表示贊成、關於他日波國遭受侵略時、蘇聯應如何予以援助一層、雙方亦已商定折衷方案、即蘇聯應以原料品與軍火接濟波國、但其軍隊並不侵入波境、至蘇聯空軍援助波國之議、尙未完全放棄、此外、以遠東問題而論、蘇聯聞已同意、可與歐洲時局問題分別處理、若派日報亦登載倫敦訪員來電、略謂「英蘇兩國談判、行將產生具體的結果、蘇聯前會提議、英蘇閒之協定應仙及日本所加諸蘇聯東陲之威脅、迄至此際、又鑒於日本正以全神對付中國、不暇旁　、乃謂猶得與德意軸心沆　一氣以與歐洲愛好和平而決心抵抗侵略之各國、相與鬥爭、是為日本之所躇躊、果爾、蘇聯可無東顧之憂、自可僅就西陲關係而與英國成立協定矣」、急進社會黨事業報載稱、「英國外相哈里法克斯與蘇聯大使邁斯基昨日談話經過頗為順利、「英法蘇三國澈底諒解、為期當不在遙、據倫敦方面所見、德國自將一九三四年波德互不侵犯條的廢止之後、波蘭已不得不倚賴蘇聯」云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間各觀察家頃宣稱、德國現正賡續推行東進政策、在取獲米美爾區域之後、又向立陶宛拉特維亞愛沙尼亞三國暗送秋波、此種策略　為蘇聯政府所覺察、爰乃向拉特維亞愛沙尼亞兩國政府提出交涉、吿以今後倘與德國相接近、蘇聯即當視同非友好的舉動、至蘇聯與立陶宛國原非壤土相接、幷未向之提出同樣交涉、但德國若果利用波羅的海沿岸各國、直接或間接向蘇聯邊境伸張勢力、決非蘇聯所能容忍、時至今日、德波兩國互不侵犯協定、旣經德國宣吿廢止、匪特波蘭與蘇聯接近之可能性巳為之增加、即波蘭匈牙利兩國邦交、原屬十分輯陸、茲亦因而發生變化、蓋以匈國今後愈與德國接近、波蘭即愈難與之維持原來關係故也、要而言之、中東歐各國對於歐洲兩大集團、原持猶豫態度、茲茲經希特勒元首張表演說之後、各該國轉可明白決定去取云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>波蘭通知法國　決心抵抗侵略　捷克亡國禍殷鑒不遠　但澤問題求公允解決</h3>

<h3>波當局考慮　對德覆文　柏克將在國會　宣布對德方針</h3>
<p>華沙　德國廢止德波兩國互不侵犯協定之後、波蘭國政府業巳召集參衆兩院於下月五日舉行聯席會議、聽取柏克外長演說、曁政府所當提出之覆文、參衆兩院外交委員會雖定於下月二日先行開會、但柏克外長不致洩露覆文內容、必待至下月五日參衆兩院舉行聯席會議時、始乃當同外交團與各報記者之前予以發表、要之、外長當仿照德兀首希特勒辦法、須俟發表演說數分鐘之前、乃將覆文送達德國政府、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙　希特勒昨日演詞中、所稱渠曾向波蘭提議二十五年不侵犯協定、及德波匈三國共同對斯洛伐克給予担保一節此問官塲現稱並無其事、希特勒無非設法造成英波間之困難而巳、波蘭官塲對於德國要求但澤復歸德國及經波蘭走廊造一汽車路直達但澤事、迄未變更其態度、如希特勒欲以此嚇倒波蘭、則希氏失敗矣、據華沙日報稱、希氏演詞發表後、波蘭國防公債銷數大增、就目前所知、官塲尙未採行關於國防之新戒備辦法（二十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>德姨波蘭　脅誘兼施</h3>
<p>（柏林）希特勒元首發表演說之後、各報與國社黨人士均謂、波蘭國對於「德國所提出之最後的寬大的建議、」不應再事拒絕、足見德國在本年秋季之前、郎當向波蘭有所舉動、實已毫無疑義、國社黨人士甚至揚言此决向波蘭所提建議、一必須立即予以接受、吾則一轉瞬閒、卽變為旣成事實、追悔莫及、」此與該黨去年向捷克所發出之警吿如出一轍、該黨人士又謂、匈牙利總琿戴萊基外長查基現在柏林、與德國當局進行談話、此舉不啻警吿波蘭、謂匈國之睦誼實不足恃、况據尙未證實消息、戴萊基總理此來携有義相墨索里尼所贊同之建議案、主張以斯洛伐克邦併入匈國版圖、而以該國便利德國對於波蘭所具之願望為交換條件、義國方面並已直接勸吿波蘭國、謂「現行環境巳屬無法維持、」波蘭國不應固執成見、自貽伊戚」云、耍之、此間一般人咸謂、波蘭國對於希特勒元首所提出之最後建議、當可表示接受、但英國對於德國廢止英德海軍協定並重新進行談判兩層、必予以吾定的答覆、實則國社黨各領袖對於英波兩國、並不期待其提出答覆、所以如此作態者、顯欲預留地步、俾他日有所舉動時、得以他國拒不接受其寬大的建議為口實、而以一切食任諉諸他國、德國之用心如是而已、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙　據義德兩國消息、英國政府日昨曾以照會送達波蘭國、略謂英國與波蘭成立互立互助協定、非欲鼓勵波蘭國採取强硬態度、拒不接受「德國所提合理而又公允的建議、」此說頃由半官機關柏德通訊社予以吾認云、英國政府並未提出此種照會、英波兩國成立亙助協定之時、德國業就但澤自由市與建造公路通過波蘭走廊兩項問題、提出建議波國亦已表明立塲、至德國應允保障波國邊界以二十五年為期一層、則在四月二十八日希特勒元首發表演說之前、該國政府從未正式提出建議云、此外、德國方面傳出消息稱、義國政府曾經勸吿波國政府、謂波國「所處環境實已無法維持、倘仍固執成見、即可招致危機」云云、亦已由柏德通訊社予以吾認、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）羅馬尼亞外長茄芬哥業自巴黎啟程來此、將與義國當局進行談話，法西斯黨人士極為重視、咸望談話結果、可使羅國加入德義軸心、俾該國所產煤油、得由德義兩國控制、並謂義國自贊助匈牙利修正界綫要求而後、羅義兩國睦誼、原已受有影響、所望匈羅兩國能就外錫爾伐尼亞省（歐戰之前屬於匈國）匈牙利少數民族問題、成立折衷方案、則羅義邦交必蒙其利云、關於羅國煤油問題、義國各報論調頗可注意、例如法西斯黨機關報德威萊報」曾就羅國煤油在戰時之重要性加以研究、略謂世界出產煤油各國、羅國位居第五、德輿兩國即因需要煤油之故、曾在歐戰期內加以佔據、「今茲德義兩國向英國包圍政策進行反攻、雖為日無多、業將若干種問題予以解決、其對於羅馬尼亞問題、豈能自認失敗乎」云、（　九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德匈談話　謀促進匈諒解</h3>
<p>（柏林）德匈會談之內容、昨夜雖未經公佈、但此間政界人士相信、經濟問題必佔重要地位、觀於匈牙利政治家與四年經濟獨裁者戈林上將會談兩决、即可斷之、德匈經濟關係現已非常昌旺、較之一九三三年時、貿易數字已增加四倍、今後更當力謀有系統的發展、經濟界人士暗示、德匈兩國或將簽訂與德羅商務協定性質類似之協定、使之發展匈牙利生產事業、推銷於德國市塲、衆信除經濟問題之外、匈牙利與南斯拉夫之關係亦將考慮及之、德國外交政策素以促進匈南兩國成立諒解、匈牙利放棄其領土少求、南斯拉夫保證其匈牙利少數民族爲基礎、若然、則南斯拉夫定能加入國際反共公約云、（三十日海通電）</p>

<h3>中西乒乓今晚秩序　　（一）靑雲甲對友邦賽（甲）七時在靑雲、（二）西靑乙對錢庫（丙）六時三刻在西靑、（三）友邦海對泰山（丙）八時半在西青、　　前賽結果　晚霞甲勝蘇壳爾甲（甲）十三對一、東塞萊乙對蘇壳爾（乙）（未賽）西青排球今晚秩序　　俄僑B對雲旦（乙一）七時一刻西靑對俄軍（甲）八時海靑對方剛甲（甲）八時三刻香島球屑　南燕自港寄　　（四）打仗，使得球員們集中在香港，今年的足球賽，因而更見熱鬧，足球總會賺了錢，笑口常開，南華會賺了錢，認為流年好、六大錦標華人隊有包辦的把握，球迷們化了錢喊聲痛快，滿意得火氣亦减少了。李惠堂是聰明人，現在因為踢了十幾年球，相當的「麥克麥克」了，平時坐着一輛不大不小的汽車（號碼四九四九）派頭十足。看看今年來香港的高等難民多，機會難再，於是乎東山再起，名利雙收，何樂而不為。高興的時候，寫幾篇稿子，往中央社一送，隔日各報競刋，互相利用利用，彼此心中有數。　　不過，李惠堂亦有他的福氣，活該耍走運，說來亦奇怪，老李不踢則巳，一踢終有紀錄的，可是，平心而論，老李假使沒有馮景祥的輸送得宜，恐怕亦不見得如此容易，所謂牡丹雖好，尙須綠葉扶持。　　由此，又想到那位新李惠堂謝慶福來了，老謝，比從前（三四年前）心廣體胖了，身村相當的魁梧，惟高度比較眞李惠堂差一些，脚頭挺硬的，頭頂功夫亦稱上好；還有一位，敎人怪想念的，中堅朱成貴，滿塲飛馳，位置好，脚頭好，截奪好，輸送好，眞是一個好人兒。　　（五）上海人當還　得，當年的四騎士（李天生·譚江柏·馮景祥·葉北華）英勇的故事，事到如今，李天生和馮景祥仍舊紅得發紫，雖然上了年紀，球藝却更圓滑了，眞够得上「爐火純靑四個字。　江柏現在昆明，偶爾亦玩玩票，談不到大刀闊斧了。葉北華却因戰事影響，從廣東來到了香港，南華會慕名而請之，從此重作馮婦，磨刀再上前綫。當星中華第三戰時，曾代表華聯一度上塲，可是脚頭生疏，往昔威風，大為减色。聽說：南華會將乘夏季之空閒，還要到南洋去跑一趟，趕空檔，賺外快」，生財有大道。葉北華見獵心喜，連日埋頭苦練，準備一顯身手，俾名利而雙收。　　原來，南華的遠征，與分錢的時候，頗有一說的價値，莫慶雖是軍師，却亦是一個獨裁者，每到賽終結賬的時候，先提出一筆「底錢，」譬如每人一百元，大家一律待遇。此外，就耍單看莫慶的手法了，先拿一枝紅筆，在白紙上東割劃西劃劃，對你高興，畫上幾十分，不高興，送你一個湯欄，然後就憑道一些洋碼子，按數分錢，分得多是你有運氣，分得少是你有霉氣，你想反抗，白費，好在南華名氣大，不怕你不靠着他。　　總而會之，每當拔師出征的時候，大家因為眼前發着光，無不一團和氣，毫無意見，前隙盡忘。反之，當班師回朝的時候，各懷鬼胎，小伙子肚中多少有點火氣。幸虧獨裁者槍法好，使得你敢怒而不敢吵，敢氣而不敢走。下次再幹時，照樣大家很高興的去，閙着　扭回來。　　不過，有個例外，包家平·李天生·馮景祥·因為是老人，同時亦不失為一顆搖錢樹，當然特別要客氣些。　　馮最祥·這傢伙，脚色相當厲害，不但踢得一脚好球，而且懂得做「人家」，開了一爿西餐館，憑他三個名字的號召，生意着實不退板，手頭着實有　鈿，可稱為小康之家了。（續完）</h3>

<p>法律發刊辭  詠華　　申報積有六十餘年之光榮歷史，報格健全，是當輿論權威而無愧，八一三後，一度停刊，吾人如斷精神上之糧食，幸未幾而復刊如恒，再接再厲，更充分發揮其天職，於日常新聞報道而外，又就國家經濟，自然科學，乃至民主疾苦之醫藥，通商惠工之旅行運輸等，有關社會問題者，分門別類，發行週刊，今日另癖法律一門，以編輯之青島之上海法規研究會，會無藉藉名，而亦具有將及十年之歷史，與其足資倡導之精神在焉。　　上海法規研究會，原名現行法規研究會：今因主編本刊，須冠地域名稱，以示幹部之所在，始正今名。其誕生遠在民國十九年五月二日，時值目不轉睛都既奠，經緯萬端，胡漢民氏領導立法，工作緊張，盛極一時；新興法規之頒行，多如雨後春筍，同人等蒿目時艱，無補國事，既依自由職業自效於社會，每以日常適用法律人各一見為憾。乃於牒訴勞形折辯瘏口之餘，聯結志同道合者十數人，以研究吾國新頒行之各種法規為目標，而定期輪值讀書。名之曰會，僅抽象的示以精神結合，從未計及組織章程，無一定之會址，無會費之負擔，會員而外，更未膾長理監等名目，固不能躋於民從學術團體之林。其集會也，每月三輪，輪駙員三人為值，當其值者，就適宜處所召致同人座談讀律，而殿之以聚餐；餐資每席不逾拾金，週而復始，互切磋磨，實較任何交際宴會為有意義。後此，聞風興起加入此精神上之集團共事研討者，頗不乏人；進退消除，今仍存有四十餘眾。切磋或有所得，即以間接方法貢獻立法當局，共著者，民·刑·商事·破產·訴訟·所得稅·遺產稅·諸法，都於立法程序未竣前，預先覓得草案，逐條討論，有所減否，亦僅推由會員憑藉友誼私交而告之參現立法者，斟酌損益，未嘗以集團之會的名義行之。故時閱十年，工作無間，而會之名義終無所聞。　　學者研究法律之法有四，曰哲學的方法，就社會制度加以評價，人各有評，易為主觀之見所囿。曰分析的方法，就現行法規詳予分析或歸類，近於機械，面旴江與實際生活相親。曰歷史的方法。就過去之法制陳跡加以整理，並求進化之程序與公例；而略於現代之情形與需要。曰社會學的方法，則視書面與現實非可同日而語，法律之於社會，譬諸蛛網中之一絲，絲絲相系，觸其一，而牽動全體；謂可離開社會，而批評法律之得失利弊，以求改進，是緣木而求魚也。往者，同人標榜研究，亦不過僅以成文法之解析疑難，與夫既成的判解之批評，供資料；固無任何方針路綫之足道。尤其於客觀事實，每不免於空疏無據，今後得藉申報之一角地，與社會人士聲氣相求，一變從來閉門讀死書之呆笨方法，而與實際活潑地社會生活為呼應，將覺社會間之事事物物，舉足資為借鏡。愿吾同人，一本已往一貫之精神，繼續努力，為本刊求充實，亦所以為自己求實也。　　本刊未經多時籌備，而能恰在上海法規研究會誕生十年初度之前一日，即世界勞工節之五月一日首次出版；亦復含義甚深，足資垂念。今後於每星期之月曜日按期續刊，除就國家及地方之法制規章，與社會反應之情況，發抒言論，扶植法律正義，闡揚法治精神而外，並歡迎來稿，隨時搜集足供研究之法律材料，對於社會民眾灌輸法律常識，以副報導之責。其文辭則力求通俗，而惟艱僻之專門化是避，邦人君子，幸匡教之！言論汪精衛之言動法律上所負之責任  鋤非　　汪精衛　以國民黨副總裁中政會副主席國防最高會議副議長國民參政會議長，於團結禦侮堅決抗戰既定之國策，忽而獨持異議，擅離其職守，發表艷電，與近衛文膺之聲明作應聲，舉國嘩然，羣起而口誅筆伐，已使汪精衛體無完膚。觀乃牢執己見，復於其御用之香港南華日報，發表『舉一個例』之文字，一時『漢奸』『賣國』之聲，風起雲涌湧，益為眾矢所集。不侫從事律師，生活於法律，本事實證據以立論，故於重慶大公報所傳其與平沼之秘密協定，雖云係當局自日方譯員方而獲得，但在政府未經公布以前，未敢遽以此為其罪狀之論斷。而其他如敵人以其艷電由飛變散發，南京偽『大民會』之為播音演講，嘉興偽『大民會』之為通電響應，偽『東亞反共會』之去電擁護，尤其是某偽報之不斷的歌頌　揚，雖均可為沆　一氣之象證。然由法律眼光觀察，猶僅足為偵查之資料，未足為論罪之根據，刑事係采真實發見主義，故對於汪精衛是否成立內亂外患罪責？姑從綏論。　　茲所論者，汪精衛負黨國中樞本兼各職之重任，際此國難嚴重之時期，不惜棄職越境，以示與政府之不合作，是於公務員懲戒法第二條第二款『廢馳職務或其他失職行為』之應負責任者一也。　　議會通例，少數服從多數，一經表決通過，舍復議外無反對餘地。國防最高會議及國民參政會之議事細則，雖未及見，無從引證，但依民權初步，當不外此原則。抗戰國策，既經國防最高會議議決，而國民參政會，又迭發擁護官言，汪精衛於國防最高會議既為副議長，而於國民參政會又身為議長，茍認為有利於國，盡可在會內發表其自信之主張。第既經大眾所不采，則其主張之無論如何光明正大，而確無背景，亦祇能犧牲己見，服從眾議，以符會議之通則。乃於經眾公決之案，妄於會外通電反汗，其去民主政治精神，抑何相遠之甚，是於議會規程之應負責任者又一也。　　國與國間政府與人民間，固常有秘密性之便應保守者。國防最高會議第五十四次常務委員會議情形，雖無關於國防計劃，然足以見政府外交上應付之策略，是其應守秘密，毫無疑義。汪精衛亦自承為此等事實，為國家利害計，有嚴守秘密之必要，乃諉謂『過去事實，不妨為之公表，以作一個例子』，則凡已成事實，何一非過去者，汪精衛曾任外交部長，其所身經所知悉有關國交之事實多　，又待過去而顧　公表者乎？其　執甚，是于刑法上第一百七十二條『泄漏關於中華民國國防以外應秘密之文書消息』之應負責任者又其一也。　　且言論自由，不守黨紀，在黨　立　，尤屬應負責任，更無待言，至於汪精衛舉一個例原文所稱當時蔣委員　對於德大使所述，固明明謂『對日本未能置信』，且有『擬請德國先慫恿日本停戰』為言，是於德大使所提各　，本末有肯定之承認，其所引證，顯屬斷章取義，因無關法律上之論據，不涉本論范圍，茲不贅。研究與批評非常時期刑事案件之指定管轄問題  靖　　抗戰迄今，已將兩年，在此二十餘月之中，司法上有若干問題，亟待解決，訴訟之管轄，即其一端。　　無論民刑訴訟，關於管轄，實為程序上最重要之一點。溯自國軍西移之後，江蘇上海地方法院，因事實上無從行使其司法權，無形停頓，若干案件之管轄法院，遂成問題：又戰事發生之後，戰區擴大，人口多集中於上海租界，然發良莠不齊，或有在內地犯罪，而以租界為逋逃藪者，此種案件之管轄，亦一個問題。　　按上海之地方法院有三：一為江蘇上海地方法院，一為江蘇上海第一特區地方法院，一為江蘇上海第二特區地方法院。若就通常情形而論，江蘇上海地方法院管轄之事件，依被告所在地定管轄之法則，或可由兩特區地方法院受理；若就特殊情形而論，亦可依戰區訟案受理及上訴劃一辦法，而由兩特區法院審判。然上海情形特殊，特區法院，因受協定之　束，管轄問題，既不適用刑事訴訟法關於被告所在地之規定，亦不適用戰區訟案受理及上訴劃一辦法，試觀關於上海公共租界內中國法院協定第五條第二項，及國於上海法租界內設置中國法院之協定第四條之規定，特區法院受理之案件，均以發生在各該管區域以內者為限，當時固以法權所在，不得不嚴加限制，初不料有今日之困難者也。　　依此而論：前所列舉之兩種情形，祇能依照刑事訴訟法第十條之規定，以有管轄權之法院，因事實上不能行使審判權為理由，請由共同直接上級法院，然江蘇上海地方法院與兩特區地方法院之共同上級法院，為最高法院；其原管轄法院非江蘇上海地方法院者亦然。現在時值非常，交通阻滯，聲請最高法院為指定之管轄，公文往返，費時費事，聞有具狀聲請，時逾一年，尚未奉裁定者，此種困難情形，在法律上雖不患無解決之途徑，而事實上之困難情形，依然未能免除，所幸司法院曾於二十七年十月十五日，以第一二七〇號指令，令知司法行政部，（原令參照本期法制要聞欄）在非常時期內，將裁定之權，移置於最高法院上海特區分庭，以期便利，而免延滯。　　依刑事訴訟法第十條之規定，訴訟案件之移轉，只須合於有管轄權之法院，因法律或事實不能行使審判權之要件，即可不問其為公訴或自訴也。即司法院第一二七〇號指令（即第七四六號訓令），亦未以公訴案件為限，故在法理上而論，公訴案件，固可向最高法院上海特區分庭，亦應視同一律，不能強為軒輊。蓋自訴與公訴，雖一則本於個人彈劾主義，一則本於國家彈劾主義，然同為懲治犯人，預防犯罪，若公訴案件與自訴案件，不作同樣之處理，則辦法紛歧，實不合於條理。且一則因移轉管轄而使被告受法律之裁判，一則因未為移轉管轄而被告仍得逍遙法外，其不平較同罪異罰為尤甚！　　雖然：理論上固應如此，而事實上最高法院上海特區分庭移轉管轄之案件，以犯罪事實發生於內地，而人犯係在上海租界拘獲之案件為限，嚴格解釋，既以公訴為限？且以人犯已經抵獲為前提，（參照本期裁判輯要）此種見解，在法理上解釋，不能謂有根據，豈司法院另有訓令，而為我人所不知乎？果爾，亦盼當局有以擴充解釋，以濟其窮也。評銀行對於記名式支票之付欵手續  王效文　　本市銀行界對於記名式支票即記載受款人之姓名並將『或來人』（字塗銷之支票）之付款，普通均須由銀行代收。執票人自行請求支付，銀行每多拒不付款。以致人地生疏或素無銀行往來之人，對於記名式支票之取款，極感不便。此種事實如不依法改正，影響於票據之流通，殊非淺　也。　　查票據之性質，原為指示證劵之一種，依照民法第七百十六條『領取人得將指示證劵讓與第三人，……前項讓與應以背書為之。……』及票據法第二十七條『匯票依照票據法第一百三十八條之規定，（支票得準用本條之規定）依背書面轉讓。……』之規定，縱使支票記載受款人之姓名，而將『或來人』塗銷，該項支票仍得以背書轉讓於人。記名式之支票，既得以背書轉讓於人，則執票人即得持票向付款人請求付款，付款人不能以『執票人是否本人，無從證明，必須委托銀行代取，方能照付』為言，因照票據法第六十八條第二項之規定，付款人對於背書簽名之真偽，及執票人是否本人，不負認定之責故也。付款人發見票據有瑕疵，或見票上簽名有不真實之情形，雖得以有票據法第六十八條第二項但書規定之責任關係，為慎重計，得拒不付，然不能對於毫無疑義之票據，亦一概拒不照付也。　　在銀行為保管真正之執票人計，或有對於付款不得不加慎重之苦衷，然於票據立法之真義實不無違背。況票據法為保護支票執票人之權桓計，已有第一百三十四條平行綫支票之南定，並說明平行綫之支票，僅得對銀錢業者支付之，則執票人如恐支票遺失，無從追究，竟為劃半行綫二道以資防范，銀行對於未劃平行綫之支票，似可不必過於慎重，致有礙於票據之　　。法制要聞淪陷區案款保證金發還辦法　　款如解部批令原呈人知照　民事刑事應分別請求核辦　　淪陷區域，如地方法院停頓中，當事人之案款或保證金，應何如發還，經江蘇高等法院第三分院楊院長鵬，喬首席檢察官萬選，呈請司法行政部核示，（二十八年四月一日）茲悉司法行政部訓令（訓字第一一六一號）云案查當事人因戰事關係，未及將法院拍賣終結所得價金具領，曾有向本部呈請查案發款，以解饑寒之厄者，旋又奉司法院訓令，對於此類案件統籌救濟辦法並具復等因，本部以為將來不獨民事昜有此類事件發生，而刑事之請求發還保證金者，亦難謂其必無，自應統籌救濟之方，當經擬定辦法二項（一）淪陷區域，地方法院停頓，遇有當事人向部詢問　款事件發生，如其案款已由法院解部保管，經查明屬實者，即可以此項案款已由法院解部保管等語指示原具呈人知照，使其安心，（二）淪陷區域，地方法院停頓，當事人向部請求發還案款時，如查明此項案款已由法院解部保管者，倘係民事案款，應分別其係在訴訟進行中抑或在執行中，由部指示其自向該管法院聲請指定管轄，或向原第一審法院以外之法院聲請執行，如係刑事保證金，亦應分別情形指示其向該管法院聲請移轉管轄，或向原法院外相當法院之請求核辦，即於本年三月十八日具文呈請司法院核示旋奉指令準如所擬辦理等因，到部。除分別咨令並呈復外，合行令仰該院長首席檢察官知照，并轉飭所屬一體知照。此令。刑事移轉管轄最高法院分庭有權裁定　　上海第一特區地方法院為刑事案件之原管轄法院在淪陷區域，不能行使職權，或因交通隔絕，不能移送。而有權裁定移轉管轄之上級法院，應為遠在重慶之最高法院，逐案裁定，亦多窒礙。擬請最高法院將此

<p>春秋「五一」勞動節  建子　　在中國遭遇那樣空前侵略戰爭的今日，在中國勞動大衆和民族資產階級被鐵騎催毀下的今日，我們來記念這一年一度的勞動節，是有其特別嚴重和特別深刻的意義的！　　勞動節的起源，完全是為了勞資雙方的「階級衝突」。勞動大衆在資產階級的剝榨壓迫下，是過着怎樣慘酷的非人生活。但終於為了要爭取「人的生活」「人的待遇」的目標下，創造出世界最偉大的勞動節。　　當然，在資本主義國家的社會裹，勞資問的對立，是深刻而尖銳化的，原因也固然是為了勞資間的階級衝突，不過，在目前中國正在和侵略者作生死存亡搏鬥的今天，我們該認淸的是，現在並沒有什麼「階級衝突一，而無疑是民族的利害已超過階級的衝突了。　　關於這一點，我們覺得很欣幸的，因為讀了根據上月份工部局發表的「租界工廠去年度罷工擾亂等的糾紛特別减少」的文吿以後，那「民族利害遠超階級衝突」就得到了很有力的證明。　　回顧一下自己的祖國正是為了要爭取「人的生活」「人的待遇」而努力抗戰的今天，脫離祖國懷抱的一可憐地方一，（郭沫若先生語）能够有這樣的好現象，我們除了欣幸之外，期望「孤島」上的勞資雙方能有更進一步的合作和努力。　　實在，資產階級和勞動大衆的開誠合作，在今天的中國是有特別的深刻意義！上海印象  （譯自密勒氏評論報）新良　　在戰前，成千成萬隻各種式樣的，大小的，顏色的沙船，就都聚集在上海的四周。它們從揚子江上帶給這個中國的大都會以無數噸的貨物，又從這里將這些貨物分配到沿海的各城市去。在日軍未到達以前，上海就在紐的，倫敦，利物浦，漢堡之下，算是全世界的第五個大港口。　　的確，上海是永不美麗的。沒有一座山能够使它出名，也甚少有幾枝樹點綴在熱閙的街頭。商業區域中的那些高聳的建築物，它們代表着全球每一個國家貿易的繁盛——大部份却是令入厭惡的。在住宅區中的那些屋宇，雖不十分高大，但也够不上稱作美麗。黃浦江與蘇州河相交地橫在這城市中，眞的幷不能够使人感到愉快與欣喜。　　當戰事未爆發之前，上海的中國當局曾經決定耍除去這些灰黃的色彩。它們就選定了上海郊外的一塊空地，開始建造一個市中心。各種宏大的建築，都是依照了中國古代的式樣倣造的。　　咋天，我看見了這個市中心。啊，那些建設的寬廣的石級，閃亮的白墻與巨大的瓦頂統被做了日軍砲火的目標。日人知道這些嶄新的，堅固的東西，正是象徵着中國前進的精神與愛國心。因此，他們用盡了各種心計，手段來破壞這些象徵——但終於不能够成功。雖然，經過了無數决的砲擊，與炸彈的轟炸，市中心的建築，迄今還矗立在那里。　　去的時侯，我的嚮導（一位美國朋友）引我走過了多重的鐵絲網，就進入了日軍的佔領區。在每一個轉彎的地方，他必須將通行證拿出來給日軍騐查。由於行人道邊還有地雷遺下的緣故，我們常須迂迴而行。起初，我們的路錢就是沿着蘇州河。當時中國兵從這里退去的辰光，這條河里據說是塞滿了兵士與老百姓們的屍體，他們有的溺死了，有的是被日兵的機關槍彈射死的。假如他們能够再繼續游過十碼的光景，他們就可以到達安全的公共租界，成千成萬條的性命也都可以保全了。　　再下去，我們就到了閘北。從上一决的巡禮，我記得那里眞的擁滿着房屋與小工廠；苦力，孩子，做生意的商人……就川流不息地充塞在街頭。可是現在呢，是多麽的靜寂呵……五十萬男男女女的呌嚷是再也看不見了。每一樣東西就可以說是無聲無息的。烟火氣，毒氣是不能够再聞到了，所可以得到的，就只是一種死樣的和平。　　除了日軍以外，這一個區域就差不多像一個無人之境。有時候，或許也會看見一個中國女人或小孩在慢慢地拾取戰爭以後的遺物。其餘，就再沒有可以稱作生命的東西了。　　在閘北的郊外是一片原野，長滿了靑草。「你要看看日軍到達時，我與妻子倆所住着的那間屋子嗎？」那位年靑的美國朋友問我。他說由於這片曠野充滿了半農村的美麗的緣故，他在兩年前，被吸引到了這里來。桑樹，稻田，荷池與菓園——但現在却全變成了瓦礫堆了。我的朋友說：「此地—就是我從前的房屋！」這句話說得我非常地吃驚。　　閘北與它的附近之處正可以顯示出日軍在遇到中國抵抗時的那種暴怒，與中國兵在抵抗時的那種奮勇。那所大學，經過兩度的大火之後，是不復存在了。中國的那所很好的圖書館也遭到了悲慘的厄運。至於那些百姓呢，我們也可以說是統統被毀滅了。雖然，見不到一塊墓碑，但是無可吾認地，「死亡」的氛圍就環繞在這個區域的四周。　　上海是並不有護照等手續的地方。我在虹口上了岸，經過外臼渡橋，就到了公共租界上來。走過這一座橋，活像煞一個鬼世界跨到了一個生動活潑的城市里。在閘北所見到的就只是荒凉的街路，與關閉的店誧。可是在這橋下去呢，活躍的人羣，旺盛的商業，代表着上海還有眞正的中國可以看到。　　日軍不允許任何車輛駛過這座橋。所以，你乘黃包車只能乘到橋底為止，你必須步行過外白渡橋，然後再僱第二輛車子。同時，你在遇到日軍的當兒，你務須要「除去你的帽子，拿在手里，愉快地微笑鞠躬，很歡喜地說早安，幷且呈騐你的通行證。得到了允許後，你謝謝日兵，於是再走過橋。」　　起初，美國人與英國人就決定不理睬橋上的日兵。但是可憐的那些中國人，日軍就不放他們忽略上面的任何一條規則。要是他們笑得不很好，或者鞠躬鞠得太不深了，日兵就立刻會用刺刀刺戳他們。卽使是中國的女人，也受着這種同樣的待遇。　　然而，在外白渡橋的另一頭，却又是顯露着如此的一個上海—商業繁盛，航運頻繁，荒淫，罪惡，東西方的合流處……這些東西會引起一般冒險者的快樂，同時，也會呌那些敎會覺得絕望，痛心。過去的一次戰爭，好像只有增加上海的淫逸與奢華而已。戰事雖使虹口的許多夜總會，銷魂窟毀滅，但租界里的放蕩，却因此而變得更緊張了。在這一方面講，上海的四周雖仍充滿着死亡與荒廢的氣息，上海却始終還是一個所謂—冒險家的樂園（下略）「初解風情」觀感  白華　　米高美公司出品南京大戲院映　　「初解風情」是賡續着「靑春不再」和「情竇初開」的第三部法官哈台家庭電影，可是前兩部戲，都因為時間關係，我沒有看到，所以所採取的故事和現在的「初解風情」有什麼不同之處，是無從知道了；不過，從譯名上看來，這三部法官哈台的家庭電影大概是採用着同樣的素材的，而且米蓋羅納和裘蒂珈倫是依舊飾演着同一的角色。　　我們看過狄安娜竇萍的「　蔻年華」，好萊塢劇作者是多麽地注意着，或者竟是攫取着這不可多得的機會，用挑撥的態度，來描寫「初解風情」的小兒女的戀愛。我們果然不能吾認人類有天賦的戀愛本能，但是用那樣挑撥的態度來攝製這些影片，我們覺得為害至烈呢！米蓋羅納會和史本塞屈賽合演「孤兒樂園」而獲得褒獎，而同樣像「初解風倩」這樣的電影也獲選十大巨片之一，這是使人大惑不解的。　　果然米蓋羅納的演技是値得我們推崇的，在「孤兒樂園」中，他那小流氓的資態，是演得非常好的，同樣，這里的天眞，戇直的法官之子安德烈，也是達於化境。，同時飾貝茜的裘蒂珈倫也能演戲，且能唱歌。　　全片對白非常生動，更山於這兩位小演員的演技的襯托，使我們完全沉浸在嘩然的笑聲中—「初解風情」的優點大概就是這一點了！「情書一束」觀後  如華　　“Blind　Alibi”　　雷電華出品　大上海戲院映　　「情書一束」的故事是這樣的：　　雕刻家保羅，有妹愛倫，為要人雷尼妻。雷尼將有入選內閣之希望。但愛倫早年誤和惡徒馬祿交遊，並有情書往來。馬祿乃以要挾，勒許二十萬法郎。愛倫逐商於乃兄保羅，幾經周折，保羅得奇犬「愛司」之助，將信毀滅。　　曾被稱為「武俠明星」的李郤狄克斯演保羅，當他追踪到洛　山城博物館中去　覓情書的時　，是偽裝一　　，因為角色的決定，英雄無用武之地了。同時，我們可以推想到打英　的電影，在好萊塢也和中國一樣，已不被觀衆所重視了。　　全片的演出，非常單調。李郤狄克斯在博物館中的行動，和匪徒也混進團物館為洒掃工人，及女當理員朱莉亞的襄助等等，都不能相互呼應，以致全片幾乎都　成了過塲戲。雨過天青  包天笑　　第九回　含悲茹苦涙灑四廂　崇儉習勞體勤十畝　　　金澹雲到了屋子裹，許多姊妹，都是認識的，十分高興。她說：『這兩天實在忙得很，這位蘇老太，一來了就不讓我有半天空閑，眞是要命。我今天本來想不來的了，因想既已答應了君素，不能不來。倘然不來，她要恨得我什麽似的，所以無論如何，要來的了。』吳君素道：『你若不來，我就有報復之法。』何雙玉呆了一呆，問道：『什麼報復之法呢？』朱愛人笑道：『她的報復之法，我知道的。可不是吃喜酒問題？』便向雙玉道。『澹雲姊的結婚日子很近了，我知道君素姊的意思，就是一你今天不來，到吃喜酒的日子，我也不來，」可是這個意思嗎？你用這個法子去挾持她，可是她的忙，也是眞的呀。』雙玉笑道：『原來如此，但是澹雲姊的吉期，我們無論如何，必耍去的。君素姊就是要報復，我們也不讓她報復。』君素向澹雲道：『你說蘇老太半天也不讓你空閑，我看到你們結婚以後，她也不許你們度蜜月旅行？你們正在燕爾新婚的時候，蘇老太婆也軋在你們裏　做討厭人嗎？』說得大家都笑了。金澹雲漲紅了險，不說什麽。朱愛人笑道：『君素姊正說得奸笑，那蘇老太到底也不是不近人情　。她因為一切事，信託了澹雲姊，凡事須要給她商量，所以不能一刻離開她了。到那時，蘇理雅太太一定也要來吃喜酒的。我從前曾經遇見過她一回，她的為人，是很好的，一點不搭架子，她最喜歡給中國人交朋友，父喜歡我們年輕的人。我們老章醫師也認得她，過一天，我們耍請她到我們醫院來參觀參觀咧。』金澹雲道：『她巳經說起過了，她很佩服老章醫師，說像老章醫師那樣的人，在他們美國，也找不出幾個呀。實在近來她也很忙，一天到晚，找她的人，也很多呢。』說到那裏時，吳君素道：『我們去吃飯吧。雖然請了你們姊姊等來，却是怠慢了你們，好在你們都是原諒我們姊妹的。』這時吳君素引導了，大家都到公共餐室裏米。這個公共餐室，並不十分寬大，原是供住居在這裹的人進餐的。在乎日原已足够，今天却顯見得擁擠了。（九九）</p>

<p>經濟專刋本刋第二次座談紀錄　平衡物價問題（續）　　日期　四月十六日上午十時起　　地點　本報五樓會議廳　　書面意見（以收到先後為次序）　　朱博泉　戰時物價昂貴，不可避免，歐戰時各國均有此種現象，故中國戰時物價昂貴，亦不足異。至目下國內各物價格，隨地而異，其昂貴之原因，亦不一律·就上海而論，一般物價，均見高漲，尤不一生活必需品為最。其主要原因，似係供求失調之故·蓋上海租界孤處於淪陷區中，貨物來源被阻，同時在東區一帶之工廠被燬被刦，生產停頓，自均足以減少貨物之供給，而需要方面，則因人口密集，消費大增，求多於供，物價自必騰貴；其次如運費保險費及其他額外費用之增加，匯價之下落與投機者之屯積居寄等等，對於物價之騰貴，均有相當影響，其中尤以投機商人之屯積居奇，最值吾人注意。蓋此種人正因物價之騰貴，乃思乘機操縱，擢取鉅利。就個人觀察，在目前上海，此種投機操縱之事，其勢頗甚，實有進行調查設法防止之必要政府對於物價應採之方策，政府對於物價，自應審察各地情形，與物品之生產及消費等條件，施以有效之統制，同時輔以健全之貨幣金融政策，至少使物價之騰貴不致超出情理之外，尤須注意生活必需品之調節，以免影響社會秩序，阻礙戰事之前進。　　最近經濟部頒布非常時期評定物價及取締投機操縱辦法，並通令各地組織平價委員會，其辦法至為適當，如能切實推行，自可收效。惟我國各地物價，向無正確之統計，各地物產亦乏精密調查，而具有物價統計知識之人才，亦大感缺乏，似宜由政府設一訓練班，招致學員於短期內授予統計物價知識，派赴各地，協助地方當局辦理調查統計事項，俾易推行。　　如何推行民間之自治的物價統制（專指上海）——政府所頒布之物價統制辦法，在目前上海，既難完全施行，祇能由民間自治團體自動辦理。鄙意以為一方面應由市商會等組織一平價委員會，羅致富有物價統計知識之人才，與各同業公會及其他關係方面之代表，為此會之中心人物，負全盤設計及監察指導之責任，同時責成各同業公會組織平價分會，辦理各該業有關之物價平衡事宜。第一步應從調查着手，如調查某種貨品各倉庫各商店儲藏之存貨究有若干，滬市人民對於該貨物之消費量究有多少，他如貨物之來源成本等，均須加以詳細調查，一方面既可察知有無屯積居奇之事實，以謀防止，同時亦可評定價格之標準，由同業互相監督運守。另一方面，金融業對於貨的押款，亦應格外注意，宜由銀錢業同業公會規定，有錢業承做貨物押款，應注意其貨物是否係供正常商業之用，抑有投機性質之屯積居奇，對於　後者應一律拒絕放款。又對於生活必需品與非必需品，亦應加以區別，前者可多予調劑，而後者應予緊縮·又上海所缺少之貨物，必需取給於內地而無關軍需者，應獎勵其輸入，由金融業上僅略舉共端，如能由各方通力合作，物價自不難穩定也。　　各國物價統制政策——歐美諸國，均係工業國家，共生產集中於少數大資本家之手，在戰時各種生產及運輸等事業，均受國家管理，物價統制，自較易辦理。我國為農業國，其政治經濟之條件，與歐美各國均有不同，且我國物價與生產消費數量等等，向無精確之統計與調查，在彼邦行之有效之方法，在中國似均難適用也。　　姚慶三　目前國內物價，較戰前漲高甚鉅，但各地情形不同，上海生活費指數約較戰前漲高百分之五十，西南各地則漲勢尤為劇烈。至其原因，則極為複雜，大概說起來，可以分為通貨方而把原因及非通貨方面的原因二種，先說通貨方面的原因，最重要的是當為法幣匯價的跌落，使洋貨價格突趨增高，而國貨之以洋貨為原料或與洋貨相競爭者，其價格遂亦隨而增高，這個原因對於上海及西南各地均可適用，至於僅可適用於西南各地之通貨的原因，則亦有二端，其一為申匯的奇昂，近來由西南各地匯款至上海，匯水總在一百元至二百元之間，換句話說，就是在西南各地交款一千一百元至一千二百元，在上海僅可收款一千元，這樣從上海方面裝去的貨物，在西南各地自需增高售價，這是西南各地物價漲高劇烈的一個原因。其二為法幣的增加，戰事發生以後，政府對於法幣的發行，雖然趨為慎重，但在西南各地，法幣之發行，仍有增加的趨勢，亦為不容諱言的事實，這也是西南各地物價漲高比較劇烈的一個原因。現在再說非通貨方面的原因，第一為供給的減少，戰事發生以後，重要貨物的產區或工塲多告淪陷，產量減少自所不免，加以各方多行統制，致貨物供給乃相形減少，物價自有漲高之趨勢·第二為運費的奇昂，戰事發生以後，各地交通梗阻，有無難以相通，縱有運輸途徑，運費亦必奇昂，貨物成本既然增高，物價自有漲高之趨勢·第三，戰事發生後，上海及西南各地人口均形突增，因此貨物需要增加，物價乃有漲高之趨勢，第四，目前商人運銷貨物，沿途多有危險，所以運到目的地後，自非抬高售價，不足報償其所冒的危險，因此物價中之五部份實含有保險費的性質。第五，商人之囤積居奇，自然亦為不可避免的現象。　　林康侯　物價漲落不定雖屬多方面，在我看來，人心關係亦必主要因素。不患寡而患不均，能均，物價即可平矣。譬如食米，人心認為將缺，有錢的人多貯若干，風聲所佈，競相貯積，囤米的人，更加居奇，於是雖有公價，暗盤仍有。又譬如人心以為通貨已在膨脹，各人競購，物價自漲。　　欲平衡物價，應先安定人心。地方當局與團體領袖，對於物品之供應，應有合作的調節，但消息的透露，萬不宜故作驚人之舉，而為投機者所利用。如是則議題中三四兩條，自可解決，而無謂問題矣。總之，統制非壞辦法，統制而違背自然調節，結果其害更有甚於不統制。所以我以為政府對於物價，僅應採用去除物價上漲或下落之原因，居於協助地位之政策，而以自治的物價統制為主動。萬不宜用生敲活釘之法。反致閭閻不安。以另有要公，未能親聆教益，諸希鑒諒，　　謝菊雪　（一）貨幣流通額增加——不問兌現與不兌現，濫發與不濫發，均足促成物價的上漲。例如歐戰期間，美國增發之紙幣，均有十足黃金準備，然而物價亦與英法同樣上騰。蓋籌碼一多，每足使貨幣貨幣之購買力下跌。　　（二）成本提高　　例如原料提供軍用，供給稀少，或勞工農夫，相率入伍，人手缺乏，鶛　生產者成本提高之原因。他如運輸之艱阻，水腳之昂貴，保險費捐稅之激增，以及瀝兌之變動，皆為販運者成本提高之原因。　　（三）供求失均　供給方面，因交通中斷，生產停止或減少，或被政府統制，敵方霸佔，以致存庇口簿；而需要方面，則消費的需要，與投機的需要，紛至沓來，供求失均，而物價乃俞俏。　　　下上海物價　貴之由一，固亦不出上述數種原因，。然若乾主要物品，向來無人從事囤積，則價格當不致高至如此。蓋本市各大倉庫堆棧，存貨　不山積，是供給稀少之說，不能成立也，中央銀行等之於發行，備極慎重，淪陷區內之法幣，祇見竭力收縮，從未增發觀於本市法幣貼水常在五十元左右，足證流通額並不如何馳鬆。是通貨膨脹之說，不能成立也。　　平衡物價方法，最輕而易舉者，莫如社由當地金融家之合作，對於貨物押款，（出口貨除外）特別對於平民生活有切膚之痛的一般物品，採嚴重警戒態度。按從事囤積者，除少數且有實力之殷富外，僅多收買大宗物品，向金融業押借巨款激增，而運用資金之途徑，至為狹窄，對於貨物押款，自屬歡迎，其情形正與一二八以前之受押不動產相同。結果助長物品囤積之風，而物價之高漲，遂不可遏。為今之計，吾人以為可由金融業約定提高受押物品之折扣，或以戰前之物價為準，同時復由公會，準備庫，及貼放委員會，共同珿相標準，以限制同業之「遷就官復顧客」。如是則囤積物品者，必有所頋忌，而物價可趨於平衡。吾人猶憶一九三七年春季，美國物價暴騰之際，美當局減低美棉受押價格，而漲風卒為所遏。又觀歷來公債行市之堅俏與萎疲，每以銀行受押折扣如何為斷，則此舉之必有顯著的效果，不難逆覩。且此舉不僅為金融業道義上應盡的職責，抑亦為保障本身營業切要之圖。誠人目下物價上漲過巨，危險滋甚，一有蹉跌，難免遭受重大損失，十餘年前絲　押款一二八前之地產押款等皆前車可鑒也。　　民間自治的物價統制，如米糧一項，每逢價格昂貴之際，輒由公團出而組織平價委員會，設法平衡，頗能奏效。目下上海米價之能不與其他物品呈同樣的狂漲者，當歸功於此種組織。茍能推行及於別種物品，則裨益於平民生計，當非淺鮮。惟囤積米糧，由來乾禁且不易久貯，故平衡尚易。而別種物價之自治的統制，必須有各業全體本利國利民之立場，於同業公會指導之下，踴躍以赴，庶可收效耳。　　劉　孫　戰時物價昂貴原因：（一）天然的交通困難，供需失需；（二）人為的，囤積居奇，操縱市價。茲試以各地米，煤球及白土布之零售物價以去年十二月為一〇〇，與今年一月比較，其變動如下：中等米重慶跌一〇·七，萬縣漲三五·八，成都漲九·一，南鄭漲一三·八，桂林跌一七·七，昆明漲二二·三，福州跌九·九，上海跌二·六：煤球重慶跌一〇·〇，萬縣無漲落，成都跌三三·三，福州漲二·一，上海無漲落，南鄭，桂林及昆明無煤球，木炭在南鄭跌六·〇，昆明漲七·〇，但桂林則漲至七八·七之多。土白布萬縣，南鄭及福州無漲落·昆明，重慶及成都各漲二·七至二五·〇，惟桂林則陡漲七五·〇之多。以上不過略舉各地衣，食及燃料之大概情形。　　政府對於物價應採之方策　　我對此問題，認為應分為兩個部份討論：（一）不需要之物品如奢侈品等等，可以不必限制，任其漲價，因為此類物品，僅少數資產階級應用，無關國計民生；惟（二）生活需要品關係大多數之人民，不得不籌劃妥善方策，如增加生產，便利運輸及編製物價等等。但須廉潔之公務員辦理，方能收效。否則辦理不善，變為政府操縱，人民所受影響，比商人操縱時尤大。最好政府加強各業同業公會組織，並監督其執行，比純由政府管理者為善。　　如何推行民間之自治的物價統制　　我認為最重要者為實行納約，或當某物漲價時用他物替代，使其因供需關係，自動調節。　　各國物價統制政策之介紹，當歐戰時，俄國有『全國食糧供應特別委員會』，『中央面粉管理局』，『中央食糧管理局』及『食鹽管理委員會』等等組織。並由『全國食糧供應特別委員會』訂定『固定價格（Fixed　Priee）』，先期將若干種貨品價格·列單公佈，以後政府購買時，照價徵收；一般交易，亦復一致按此價格購買。另一種為『制定價格（Regulated　Priee）』，為各地方政府所強制限定之出售價格，凡交易之不按『制定價格』出售者，政府予以處罰。俄國實行此兩種辦法，實為商業國營之初步，在初推行時，亦頗有種種困難，中間亦經數度之改革，方收其效果。其他國家統制物價之方法，亦復各有所常；但我國情形與歐美國家不同，似不能盡仿效陳法。　　潘恒勤　（一）并非由於通貨膨脹（理由請見銀行周報四十七期第三頁）　　（二）由於戰時軍需浩大，必需品需要增加　　（三）奸商屯積居奇壟斷市塲　　（四）耕地論為戰區，工廠為敵摧毀，生產無從進行　　（五）保險費加重，利息抬高，生產成本加重　　（六）日人強征重稅，致成本加重　　（七）交通斷，運輸不便　　（八）由於外匯暗市，舶來品價格上漲，從而引起本國物品價格之上漲　　（九）消費增加，上海人口已自三百萬人激增至五百萬人（根據最近報紙對於人口統計之發表）　　（十）金融業競做貨物押款　　政府對於物價應採之方策　　（一）應設立統制物價委員會統籌一切方案　　（二）公定價格　　（三）定額分配　　（四）統制消費　　（五）溝通運輸　　請閱中外經濟拔萃一卷十二期第十頁　　（六）原則上最好取消外匯暗市但不易辦到則當局對於必需品輸入所申請之外匯應盡量供給，因而現行外匯核準之技術。應有改革之必要，俾真正必需品之輸入能夠獲得外匯。　　如何推行民間之自治的物價統制　　（一）廣事宣傳物價統制之里要，此為山版界應負之責　　（二）利用商業團體，如同業公會等為民間統制物價之主腦，同業公會若果能負責辦理，收效必宏。　　（三）由同業公會取締商人居奇操縱　　（四）節約運動，為推行民間之自治的物價統制最好之辦法　　（五）由政府會同銀行以金融力量調整物價如茶葉質押政府規定最高利率之類　　座談紀錄之二　　張一凡：歸納各位先生對於物價飛漲上的理由，和各種物價上漲程度不同的事實：我們可找到一個結論：　　（一）當前物價上漲的主因，與其說由於通貨影響，毋寗說為了供需關係的不均衡。因為匯價跌落而影響到物價直綫上漲的關係，也該早已停止。但事實依然有繼續上漲之勢。可見在匯價之外，還有其他理由，這理由，便是供需關係，并未有所改進之故。　　（二）供需失均的主要理由：在於中國工業區域大半淪亡，生產自然大受打擊。戰區面積廣大，戰區內的貨運關係，被日偽的種種阻礙，以至於苛征暴歛；戰區與非戰區之間，除了日偽的阻礙貨運之外，又受中央對於進出轉口貿易的統制，內匯外匯的統制，無不使貨物的自由流通關係，斷續不定，而運費，保險費，匯水的高漲，消費區的物價如果不大漲，生產品的貨物不願再去。因此只要有貨物在流通，便以消費區的價格，比生產區的價格，貴到可以大發國難財為前提，所以就造成物價在空間上的不同。而這種不同，除了環境上的客觀條扒件之外，顯然包藏着壟斷居奇，高價待沽的投機操縱的道德條件在內。　　（三）工藝品和礦產品的價格漲勢最大，農產原料品的漲勢較低，鄉村間的農產物價甚至普遍跌落，而都市間的物價普遍上漲。進口品一致上漲，土產品上落頗有程度之差。這都由通貨和供需的關係及其交織而成的局面，但通貨方面的影響，只限於匯價的暗盤影響，而非通貨的流通數量的增加，進口品受匯價上漲，與進口物價漲，也波及若干土產品物價而因之上漲。與進口品無關的土產品物價，為了貨運關係和供需關係的變化，在空間上便有極大的不同。這空間上的不同，又可彼此相互影響而走上一致漲的過程，如棉紗產區的上海，果因生產減少而上漲：但因內地需要殷亟，便高價待沽。客商販入內地，在昂貴的時價裏再加進運費等成本，和正常的利潤外，復利用當地的需要程度而加入不正當的利潤，就是投機的價格利益，於是內地的出售價格更貴，這更貴的價格，影響到產區的上海，上海紗商又以此為高價待沽的標準。如是互相因果，就飛漲不休。直到發生自然節約的時候為止。　　（四）但生活必需品的節約，有其一定限度。因此這類物價的上漲，便不易有何止的可能性，如果發生休止狀態，那時國民生活所受的壓迫，可謂已到了最高的程度。無論從生產者方面說，或者從消費者方面說：都是不利的。消費者的不利最明顯。生產者方面對於高物價的不利，卻不為一般人所瞭解。所以常把高物價時期，作景氣時期。但現在高物價的理由，既由於第二級成本的增大，這類成本便是發生於流通過程內的運費，保險費，匯費，而以日偽的苛征暴歛為尤大。這類暴稅，在商人固視為成本之一，在日偽則係不勞而得。假使上海的物價漲勢有一定的程度，那末這不勞而得的敲詐，也就不得不有一定的限度才行。但上海是自由市塲，物價可任意飛漲，這不勞而得的敲詐也就可任意需索。所以維持上海物價的自由市塲，獲利的生產者，毋寗說是日偽和外商。而外商的生產費既根本貴，匯價影響又深，所以獲利的可能還遠不及日商。何況戰區市塲，又都受日軍控制，進出毫無自由。所以不論在生產者方面，消費者方面，以至於外商方面，都該把眼光放遠，來共同把當前上漲中的物價，平衡在合理的標準上才行。　　沈真一　平抑物價，據本人意見，首先須分別品種，作下列三項看法：（一）外銷商品，（二）奢侈品，（三）日用必需品·關於第一項，因為上漲是有利的，直毋須平抑。第二項是專供少數人享受，與一般人無大關係的，亦可任其自然上漲。惟獨第三項的日用必需品，就目前情勢而言，實有設法平抑之必要·誠然，在現時特殊環境之下，任何良好辦法，均不易獲得美滿效果。然若能盡其在我，量力而行，由各同業公會以最大勢力，出而維持，亦未嘗不可為。如米價在百物騰貴的今日，尚能立於十四元之限價，比戰後一般的物價漲度均低，此不能不歸功於米業公會也。又如絲織品戰後上漲程度，亦不若生絲之高，照最近絲價說，比四散前要漲起一六一%，而絲織品不過漲四七%至二六%，其間雖不無因生絲與人造絲交織關係，成本賴以扯合減低，但聞該業同業公會亦曾議定平抑章則，不欲與絲價為同一的狂漲暴落，實有以致之。至如目今生油和豆油價格飛漲，雖由於另一特殊問題，似一時不易平抑，然該業如果向積極方面進行，亦未嘗不能設法補救。據黃豆與豆油的漲度來看，最近油價比兩月前要漲起七一%，而同一時期的豆價則漲一五%，相去懸殊。在此油價高也原料甚鉅的時候，內地農村用土法榨油的油坊，必因獲利優厚而樂於增加生產，倘能疏通來源，亦可平抑目前的油價，一方面再於本市多設小規模油廠，向內地採購黃豆來製油，那更是根本之圖。依此看來，各同業公會如本民間自動平衡物價的精神，從事於疏通來源，增加生產，或以他種代用品來抑平某種因缺貨而高漲的物價，則縱在極困難主的情勢之下，至少亦可得到平抑一部份物價的效果。望與論界要發揮力量，啟示一切。想各業必不讓米綢兩業專美於前的。（未完）信箱歐洲萬一開戰　　倪亞斐先生來函　（上略）歐局日益嚴重，戰禍似無可避免：我國雖處亞東，然世界大勢，息息相關；漩渦所起，諒亦不無影響。茲有舉問題數則，敬請明教：　　（甲）歐洲萬一發生戰事，則　　（一）對於我國抗戰期間之國民經濟，有何影響？　　（二）我國在外金準備，將否遭受若何不利？　　（三）我國法幣與先令之關係，將發生變動否？　　（四）國外資金，將因戰事而來避我國否？　　（五）我國市塲上之外幣值，將否貶值或反之？　　（六）我國對外貿易及進口業將陷於完全停頓否？尤其是我國軍需需之進口？　　（乙）上海一般生活費指數，其將更形高增？或反急趨跌落否？　　記者謹答　截至現在為止：未來歐戰的性質，還沒有確定：是帝國主義戰爭？還是反侵略戰？這以蘇美是否參加為決定關鍵。這兩個不同的性質，對我國經濟以至整個世界經濟，也有不同的影響。政治和經濟彼此聯繫，平時如此，戰時尤其如此。所以對於上列各問題，也得按戰爭性質來分別處理。並須注意到與日本經濟的對比關係。　　如果以蘇美參加而以反侵略為目的的戰爭，那末我國所處環境，有三種不同變化的可能：一是由於日方受到他方面壓迫，俾我總反攻，而且作絕對優勢的總反攻機會。因此戰時經濟建設的動力，將由內地而急速擴展至克服地帶。這種軍事形勢的改進，外資很有避難來華的可能。除非戰爭國立即嚴厲管理其資本市場以致成為不可能。但其時必因民氣振奮，而進入真正的有錢出錢（包刮助餉與投資），有力出力（包刮投軍與勞役）的階段。國民經濟的發展，必遠較前次歐戰時迅速而合理。二是日方出賣其同盟，并以中國戰區內之資源為誘引英美的漁餌之可能。英美愿否受諞，或將以蘇聯在歐作戰之成績而定。惟中國必不甘為英美所賣，故繼續抗戰。英美為在華權益未來命運計，即使對日妥協，亦不致變更對華抗戰之間情與援助，是以中國處環境或較今日尤為艱苦，但作戰所需之一切經濟條件，仍不致中斷。如英美竟受日方欺諞，我國又竟受英美所諞，則在中國境內之經濟活動，必在日方控制下加速進行，結果，殖民地經濟過程於焉完成。非特毫無國民經濟之福利與效果可言，我國國民全體之財富與血汗，且將為之榨乾。但這種可能性極為微弱，至少非至歐戰末期不易發生。第三：日本或加緊其對華作戰行動，中國恃地理形勢堅守外，複擴大淪陷區內之遊擊戰。這局勢或於歐戰爆發前後立即發生，或遲相當時日發生，或繼續不斷而展開長時間的戰　，或時斷時續地展開。日本必要速戰速決為主，不決時或轉改取消耗戰，以便進行其離間反侵略戰線之餘暇。我國是否仍采消耗戰方式則未可必。但反侵略戰線如堅守信義，那末日方的此種作戰行動，必促其早潰，惟在中國經濟方面，命運便較難判明。但日本對戰區內的經濟其厲嫁娶lated　Priee計劃，必仍不外乎加緊其掠奪，但其時的資金困難，及其國內的通貨危機，必較今日尤烈。因為他的財閥更不敢冒險對華投資，從而其駝貨膨脹的發展，必更惡劣的展開，結果只加速其國力的崩潰而已。　　至於我國在外金準備，到那時已無所謂利不利？就是現在也是如此。因為我國根本沒有收回的必要，而且又並不是寄存在一國。並且它對於抗戰的貢獻，與其說在護衛法幣，毋寗說在強調財政在外信用，一國財政信用，除現物基礎外，還有政治基礎，覆按上節，則可知更無問題。　　戰初，英政府如不取緊急措置，英鎊不免發生暫時動搖。但依一九一四年的經驗，大體尚能維持其穩定，今日英鎊的防衛機構已極完備，現代匯兌統制的技術又較前圓美多多，事實上，美國當即參戰的話，那末國際金融市場不致被戰事捲起風浪，至于我國的法幣地位，事實上早受政治地位操縱一切。所以問題不在歐戰發生，而在歐戰發生后我國所處環境如何？這可以上列三種變化加以覆按。且以人心振奮而因之堅挺的可能性較多。如近日華北法幣價值激漲，日偽劵大跌，未始不受美日外交新姿態，與蘇英談判中提出對日問題之影響。　　甲題第四項于前節已有說明。第五項則根本不成立。因為決無一國在戰時有采取貶抑其幣值政策之必要。如以其市場價格之變化言。則由上節說明內亦可類推之。　　現在沒有一國堪稱有完全自給自足的條件，美蘇亦非全能：其他更不必說。因此他們非有出口，即不愁不能進口：因此只要我國繼續出口，即不愁不能進口，如前述第一種可能成為事實，則我國之出口必較今日猶增，是以復有進口增加之可能。中國既是反侵略戰國員這一，自不愁友邦對我軍需品之供給與援助。且軍需品進口之必要程度：尚隨　儲藏量：　戰局之發展與戰利品之取得；　與對方之對比關系等情勢而定。以此，吾人雖不可妄測，但亦不必杞憂。　　如以蘇美之中立而仍展開帝國主義爭奪殖民地之戰爭。則我國彼時之經濟環境，不致與今日有何鉅變。至于乙題，雖亦隨政治環境之變遷而異。但有一點得懸測者：即人口勢必較今日減少，因此通貨方面若無惡劣之摧殘而能克維現狀時，則雖以來貨或將稍減，物價方面仍不致起若何變化。商業新聞金融　現金未有做開　英印銀價下游　　昨日本市現金烚赤暗盤、逢星期例假、致價亦未曾喊過、據詢錢兌業門市部、價仍在前最后成交價左右、售出二千〇七十八元、收進七十五元、出納亦稀、　　銀樓業首飾金每兩兌出仍平、大同行掛二百十一元、新同行二百〇九元、收進均約二百〇三元、又東來升金鋪昨遷新址開市、門售烚赤掛二百〇七元、　　廿九日倫敦電、英純金未更、每盎斯仍七鎊八先令六辦士云　　二十九日倫敦電、英銀市印度少數賣出、投機家買進、市面平、大條銀近遠期均降〇六二五、紐約電、美銀價呆定如故、又孟買電印銀市況略疲、現期貨俱縮三安那、偽鈔狂跌　一瀉難制　聞已對折　　上週間、因華軍在各戰場、均獲勝利、捷報遍傳全國、天津偽『聯合準備銀行』之紙幣、人民益加不愿收存、上週一暗市開盤與前週六較、每百元即狂賤四元二角五分、法幣百元、可換『偽鈔』一百二十一元五角、週二未有更動、週三續賤四元、價為一百二十五元五角、週四再狂跌五元、價為一百三十元零五角、週五上午開盤、又賤一元五角、價為一百三十二元、繼聞華軍包圍南昌、『聯合準備銀行』亦有動搖之訊、『偽鈔』價續大跌、同時天津金價漲至每兩二百五十元左右之高價、并即日（二十八日）起暫行停拍數天、再定辦法、又物價飛漲、大米每包之價、已超過三十元、週六『偽鈔』繼續下賤、各銀號在強暴壓力之下、不敢開市、暗盤明市無價、而『偽鈔』實際買賣、已跌至一百四十元及半折之間、市面頗為混亂、證券　閘北水電公司債　今日仍未付本息　　閘北水電公司、于民國二十三年十一月、為償還銀團借款及擴充設備起見、發行公司債、國幣六百萬元、系分兩期發行、年息八厘、期限八年、每年五月一日及十一月一日各還本付息一次、并委托四行儲蓄會·及交通·金城·中華·勸工·浙江興業等銀行、經理發行事宜、該項債券發行後、信用卓著、本息均按期照付、但自八一三戰事發生、該公司營業地址、首當其衝、損失浩大、不得已宣告停業、自二十六年十一月一日（第六期）起、應還本息、經董事會議決、暫時延緩償付、由經理委員會公告持劵人查照在案、今日為該公司債第九次還本付息之期、聞該公司因戰事迄未結束、復業尚需有待、仍照舊例、暫緩履行辦法辦理、查該項公司債、第六期至第九期共計四期、應還本金一百五十萬元、利息五十六萬六千四百元、兩共二百零陸萬六千四百元、而愆期應補利息、尚未在內、糧食　囤胃轉懈　杜米無甚榮辱　　昨日各幫來源、河下未到車輪包子仍祇蘇同幫一千六七百包、大局自經隔昨一度轟動後、昨本街及囤戶銷場轉懈、實因天時悶暖、人心未免懷虛、故結果若厚薄粳市面悉轉定局、無甚榮辱、杜洋尖埠尖及變元亦皆未有軒悼也、糖市　糖價堅定　　昨糖市趨勢漸定、公會劃盤二四粗白、外棧現貨二十七元六角半、本棧二十七元八角、大金錢嘜二十八元一角、轉口二四粗白十九元五角半、成交三百包、現貨荷赤十七元八角、轉口又十二元一角、太古糖B嘜西棧二十七元〇五分、OW嘜二十六元九角、DY嘜二十六

<p>自由談分化  茂烈　　從前稱為離間，現在稱為分化，在國際外交上佔着重要的地位，自古已然，於今尤烈。　　希特勒昨天的演說，固然有許多地方，可以供我們的論列，但是他在這演說中所具的分化作用，却也可以使我們注意。　　第一，他絕口沒有提到蘇聯。誰都知道，他以反共為號召，自認一切措置，目的無非在防止共產主義的氾濫。按之　情，他在這種重要的時機，對於蘇聯，就要極盡其抨擊的能事了，可是事實上他却隻字不提。這裹面的用意，好像在說，他是在和英國作直接的衝突，對美國作問接的答覆，與蘇聯無關，蘇聯不必過問他的事情，正和他實際上也不過問蘇聯的事情一樣。　　第二，他「對於法國，獨加靑睞，」說，德國自收回薩爾之後，對於法國，在疆土上已經沒有什麼糾紛。他的意思也就是說，法德本身旣然沒有什麽威脅，正不必和英國沆　一氣，而有事於中歐，更不必和英國一樣，不憚煩地作仟何弱小的保鏢。　　第三，他威脅着波蘭，要波蘭脫離英國的關係，而和德國直接交涉。這也許是他全篇演說中最重要之點，因為他的要求收回但澤，已經是他在目前最迫切的企國。他廢止了德波協定，又「竭力安慰其他各國，以陷波蘭於孤立，」他對於波蘭，巳經是佈置完成了。　　總之，他這决的演說，表面上是對羅斯福的答覆，實際上是對英國的進攻。因為羅斯福的詢問，本來不答覆也不要緊，答覆了更沒有什麽直接的關係，只有英國，素來是他所最忌，而目前英國的微兵，允為他所痛心疾首，他一毫都不能放鬆。有人說，他的防共，實際就是防英，也就是這個道理。他現在固然還不見得立刻對英國挑戰，但要削弱英國的勢力是很顯然的。削弱的方法，便是分化：分化其他國家與英國的合作。　　蘇俄和法國的不會上當，是毫無疑問的。波蘭則不免為捷克之續，為所吞噬吧。由此可見，運用分化的，未必能如願以償，間題的癥結，還在被分化的會不會上當，或是願不願意放棄合理的合作。父子之間  錢昌年　　（一）　　陸有德畢竟是老了。別人雖然說他身體還很强健，可是他自己却不願冉在外面混：凡是以前替人做的保，一概登啟事辭去；就連甚麽慈善救難會聘請他擔任董事的名義，他也一口咬定地辭掉。　　『這年頭……總是少一件事好一點啊！』他常常這樣說。　　眞的，自從中日戰事發生之後，陸有德整個的變了模樣：他祇打算怎樣能安穩地坐在家裏過一輩子「老爺」的生活便滿足了。當然囉！這種主意可沒算錯，他有的是房屋，僕役和銀錢，自然沒缺少什麽，也不冉需要些甚麽的。　　陸有德有一位太太，曾被那眞鐵筆大相士讚過一番說是幸而她的眉毛沒生少一根，所以將來一定是「後福無窮」的。怪不得她的身體簡直胖得像一條老母豬，沒有福氣的人怎配？　　這是許久以前的事了。現在呢？陸太太養下來的兒子也已經十七歲啦！　　（二）　　陸耀宗完全不像他的老子，至少不比陸有德那般怕事。　　陸有德閉緊大門在家過那淸閒的生活底時候，他的兒子却當選了學生救亡會的勸募組主任。陸有德是做夢也想不到自己的兒子竟會這樣「膽大妄為」的。常耀宗含笑的將一册　捐簿遞到父親的手裹，哦德看完了之後，突然變了嚴厲的聲調說道：　　「大毛！你瘋了麽？」　　「不！父親，這是每個國民應盡的責任：有錢出錢！有塗！現在時局這樣下去……還不知什麽時候才平定……大家總要節省些才對。那裏還有多餘的錢去捐……什麽？大毛！原來你還是勸慕主任？那還了得！一家人的性命都要被你送掉了。哼！這捐册上面有你的具名，要是發生了什麽事故我可擔常不起。……咳！其實你也太沒腦筋了！家裹食的，穿的，那一樣缺了你的？怎麽偏不安分却去幹那危險和沒出息的玩意？……」　　「爸爸！你說够了沒有？聽我說——」　　「混帳！你還要來挺撞我？」　　「爸爸！你不捐也就算了，何必多話。耍是像你這樣有錢的人還捨不得拿錢出來，中國就快……」　　「畜生！快住嘴！」　　「哼！自己不愛國却不許別人愛國，那才算是有腦筋？別做夢！享福的日子不能過一輩子的。別以為有錢就可以………」　　「畜生！你居然駡起我來了？快和我滾出去！』有德氣到臉色山紅紫變成蒼白。　　（三）　　經過這一塲吵嘴，以後他父子倆就是遇見的時候也不交談一句話。耀宗表面似乎很平靜其實暗地裹工作得比以往還要起勁。有德呢？整天在家裏拍　踢椅的大駕，可是沒有人理睬他。　　有一天，有德總算把怒氣平息了。他把兒子親親　然地喚到房裹來。　　「大毛！你這　火了還不知道孝順嗎？為甚麽要和你的爸爸作對，要知道我敎訓你也不過想你學好罷了。你想，世界上那有老子不愛惜兒子的道理。希望你自己明白不要使爸爸姘過才是啊……」　　「爸爸！我很了解你的處境和你的一番話。不錯，在家庭的立塲來說，你的話並沒有說銷。但是，以整個國家的立塲而言，你不應該使用你的私心把兒子强留在家裹的。」耀宗說話時兩眼充滿了神聖的光芒。　　（四）　　兒子是和那放在櫃　裹的六百元同時失踪的。而且，都是永遠不回來的了。　　為了這件事，有德又鬧了好幾天的脾氣。對着陸太太便這樣駡這：　　「都是你這老不死的才會生出這種好兒子！」　　聽了丈夫的責駡，陸太太方始對十幾年來牢記在心中的那一句「後福無窮」的話起了大大的疑團。意外  譯「紐約時報」談餘  編者　　勞動的「動」字，不知為什麽原故，有許多人總喜歡寫作「働」。有人說，這是「友邦」傳來的。但不論怎樣，我們有「動」字，意義很顯明，實在用不着再造或另用這「働」字，反致書蛇添足。擴大勞動的意義  亦星　　今天是勞動節。原來的意義是紀念勞動的神聖，慶祝勞動地位的抬高。但我們，中國的同胞，允其一切體力與心力的勞動者，到了這日，還應該要另外有一個認識，並出以另外的決心。　　人類的所以要勞動，無非為了求生存，求自由與獨立的生存。到了這種生存受阻礙時，自然應該起而反抗，與以糾正。現在我們正在爭取這種生存同，因此，我們於平常的勞動以外，就應該時時記得這一點，給以淸楚的認識：沒有滿意的生存，勞動是徒然的，簡直是奴隸性的！　　於是怎樣去爭取這樣的生存，便是我們目前最重要的問題。別的不談，就勞動而言勞動，我以為不論是體力的勞動，心力的勞動，不論在前方，在後方，在孤島或內地，我們總要有一個決心：國家至上，民族至上！我們的勞動，決不應沾沾於個人的生存！我們要在各人的本位上，照此目的努力下去！　　此外，我想我們現在的抗戰，就可以當作努動的一種吧。因為抗戰的目的是要建國，建國是一種工程，而所需要的就是勞動，那末要紀念勞動節，慶祝勞動節，自然就格外要抗戰了！（義賣獻金）孩子見地  聞歌　　針對著「游來游去」的亡國謬論，便來了一個實施國民精神總動員的通電。這等於淸夜的　聲驚醒了迷夢中的人們一般，是極有意義的。允其是在這所謂孤島的上海，更應該鄭重地注意著了。本來，這精神總動員僅是最低限度的愛國標凖，論理每個中國人似乎不必等人提醒就早該自動履行；但事實上却一定要蔣委員長通電後方才理會到，這在我們民衆是多麽感到慚愧的一件事啊！　　現在，這精神總動員的實施已亦然烈地宣傳中了，大部份民衆也已對於這動員有了相當的認識。可是—却不能諱言，實際上還祇側重於識字的知識人羣中；至於知識水準比較次的和甚至不識字的羣衆，至少我敢說還沒有多大的影響發生。雖然他們不會便因精神動員影響小到而個偭做出喪心病在的賣國行為，但對於勝利信念的懷疑論者却不能說絕對沒有。因此，我們要撲滅這種盲目式懷疑論者的毒素起見，不僅要側重於所謂上層的知識份子的宜傳，更要進一步深入到所謂下層的無知識的羣衆間的宣傳，使全國民衆不分上下層都能明瞭精神總動員的根本意義而急起實行。要達到這一點，我們也不能單有表面上的文字上的宣傳，而應該盡量利用別種較好的方法。因為文字上的宣傳是對於知識份子而發的，在不識字的民衆除了看到幾詐方方正正的字以外，當然一無所知。　　寫到這裏，也許有人會說，「精神總動員還是最近方才提起，何必這樣躁急呢？」但我却以為這動員原在抗戰開始時便該實施的，竟　到現在，雖不能說遲，也不能說還早，當然不能再從從容容踱著方步做去。所以雙管齊下是必然的事實。何况現在在派和其他賣國者都在以巧妙的反間計愚弄着民衆，我們決不能坐視他們東竄西竄的白日橫行，惟有以精神總動員來迎頭膺懲，我想這無論如何是該如此做的。　　總之：關於精神總動員，有相常知識的人可以不用遲疑而立即實行，若冉要有入宣傳方肯硬了頭皮去做，那這人似乎太不中用。所以我以為動員的宜傳最正確的對象應該是知識不及水準的民衆。　　最後，我謹以至誠希望每一個了解精神總動員的意義的先生們：設法抽取你們的空暇時間為我們的知識不及水準的羣衆宣傳這問題的一切。尤其我們這些蟄居在孤島上的「幸福的」島民，眼前似乎不受甚麼驚嚇，無疑更應該為這事出一點力。　　努力吧，努力發揚我們爭取自由的精神。　　我是一個孩子，孩子的見地是會使人們笑痛肚皮的，好在大人先生們大約不會計較什麽，我謹在這裏吿個罪。</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Unofficial sources have reported the recapture of Nanchang by Chinese troops, but Chinese military authorities only announced that Chinese troops surrounding Nanchang have advanced to the suburbs and that several Chinese units have captured the new and old airfields and the train station. It is noted that the airfields and train station are six miles away from downtown Nanchang. At the same time, well-informed Chinese observers believe that Chinese troops have likely reached the outskirts of Nanchang and are very active, but due to a lack of siege artillery, they have been unable to capture the heavily defended key city held by a large number of Japanese troops for the time being.

<h3>Situation in the Lower West River is Very Tense - Japanese Attempting to Flank Zhaoqing - Deng Longguang is Directing His Troops to Resist - Bai Chongxi is Transferring Guangxi Troops to Reinforce - Northeast Jianghua Troops Continue to Counter-Attack</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Japanese troops in Guangdong are now concentrating their main force to invade the west. The situation in the lower reaches of the West River is very tense. Although Heshan City has fallen, Chinese troops are still engaging in hand-to-hand counter-attacks. Japanese troops are also launching joint land and air attacks and are currently engaged in fierce fighting on the "1758" highland.

Deng Longguang is directing his troops to resist, and Bai Chongxi is also transferring strong Guangxi troops to reinforce, determined to conduct an annihilation battle in a favorable area of the West River. The Northeast Jianghua troops continue to counter-attack, causing the Japanese to be stretched thin and unable to attend to everything.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Welcoming May</h3>
<p>May 1st, as Labor Day, transcends national borders and class prejudices, and is a widely recognized and respected memorial day throughout the world. It has been observed in China for over a decade, and is referred to as "May First." Following May First are other days, such as "May Third," "May Fourth," "May Seventh," "May Ninth," and "May Thirtieth," each with its own well-known history and familiar name. In addition, there is May Fifth and May Fifteenth. During this month of May, what is commemorated in China is either revolution, martyrs, labor movements, cultural movements, massacres, or national humiliation. From May First to May Thirtieth, there are as many as eight different commemorations. Although they differ in nature and object, they all occurred within the past twenty-odd years. May in China is truly a special season.</p>
<p>Looking back, in the days when warlords ruled and unification was not yet achieved, those in power were always particularly vigilant during this special season, as if worries would accompany May. Those below were particularly active during this special season, as if May would bring hope. Thinking back now, not only are the historical facts vividly present, but the scenes of each annual memorial day, whether solemn, gloomy, inspiring, chaotic, joyous, or tragic, with flags at half-mast, gatherings and parades, slogans, martial law, and the lifting of martial law, are all as if they happened just last night. Even in the early days of the Nationalist government's capital in Nanjing, although it no longer viewed this season with fear, it still took it very seriously. What were the concerns and fears of those in power? Nothing other than their own awareness of being distant from the people and acting against public opinion, causing them to feel uneasy and take precautions. Until last May, the scenes of fear and seriousness of previous years were reversed, and there was a generally vibrant atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now, at the beginning of this special season of 1939, we will predict the peace of this season. "May First" has an international nature and will naturally not be affected by China's situation alone, affecting the meaning of Labor Day as a whole. However, Labor Day is most likely to trigger the impulses of the labor community. This is certainly possible in other countries, but absolutely unimaginable for the Chinese labor community this year. As for "May Third," the subjective and objective commemorative values of all the historical facts being commemorated, even if they are compared and weighed one by one, the people of previous years had their own reasons for not wanting to weigh the value of the commemorations but insisting on commemorating them. To analyze it, dissatisfaction with reality was transformed into various forms of movement to shake, change, or correct reality, this being one reason. Agitating, awakening, calling on, promoting, and organizing society, this being another. Signaling the authorities, either complaining and criticizing, or expressing suppressed feelings, or wholeheartedly supporting, or offering well-intentioned encouragement, this being another. Showing the outside world to demonstrate the unforgettable nature of hatred, to show the invincibility of popular sentiment, and to seek freedom and equality for the nation, this being another. Having no ability to exert effort or vent feelings, they sought temporary pleasure, this being another. These five points are the reasons why various commemorative days were seized as opportunities. In previous Mays, many incidents occurred for these reasons, but this May will be different. China's war of resistance has lasted for twenty-two months, and the declared goals are military priority and victory priority. Therefore, apart from the reality of the war of resistance, there is nothing that is not an indispensable reality. Even in terms of the government and society, it cannot be denied that they are both advancing towards the declared goals. Is there anyone who is dissatisfied with the war of resistance and seeks to shake, change, or correct it? Is there anyone who is criticizing the authorities? In the face of the great disaster, only the practical human and material resources are exhausted to meet it. Is there a need to spread it through banners, gatherings, writing, or speech? Is it said that in the face of the reality of the war of resistance, there is still no ability to exert effort or vent feelings, and that effort and venting are directed at commemoration? Towards foreign countries, is there a stronger expression of this war of resistance, or a more effective expression than this war of resistance? China's five thousand years of history, which it has always been proud of, naturally has its indelible value. Everything after the 1911 Revolution naturally has its place in history. However, compared to the current war of resistance and nation-building, which is a great undertaking unparalleled in its past and future, the historical facts that should be commemorated in May cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Taking a step back, since the goal today is military priority and victory priority, that is, the will should be concentrated, and the strength should be concentrated. Therefore, what could be commemorated before the war of resistance is at least what there is no time to commemorate during the war of resistance. Why is there no time? Immerse yourself in the war of resistance! To welcome May and spread it in form is, if not disheartening, at least not necessary for immersing oneself.</p>
<h3>Pittman's Suggestion to Sanction Aggressor Nations - Chongqing Side Finds It Satisfactory</h3>
<p>External Spokesman Says:</p>
<p>All Countries Should Immediately Take Effective Action to Safeguard Individual and Common Interests</p>
<p>(Chongqing) US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman's suggestion to authorize the President to impose trade sanctions on countries that undermine the Nine-Power Treaty is viewed here with satisfaction. An external spokesman said, "Pittman's suggestion is undeniably important for human peace and welfare. The Nine-Power Treaty is the only principle for lasting peace in the Far East. If China's integrity is undermined, it is difficult for us to foresee the continued 'open door' policy in China. Japan's violation of the rights of third countries has shown the correctness of this observation. Since negotiations with Japan by various countries have been ineffective, effective action should be taken immediately to safeguard individual and common interests. All firm attitudes at present are sufficient to prevent Japan from taking new acts of aggression. If Pittman's suggestion is accepted, it will definitely sanction Japan. If the US stops supplying Japan with war materials, Japan's combat capability will be greatly weakened." (30th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

He said that his trip covered the central Hubei front line, where he met with senior commanders and contacted soldiers and civilians from all sides. He gained a very good and deep impression.

<p>Another Diplomatic Action by Roosevelt</p>
<h3>Will Host a Banquet for European Countries - Accept Hitler's Request - Conclude Non-Aggression Pacts Separately with Germany - Western Hemisphere Countries to Issue Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to消息 here last night, US President Roosevelt will launch another diplomatic action. He will have the United States, together with the twenty-one countries of Latin America, issue a declaration asking European countries to accept Hitler's invitation to conclude non-aggression treaties with Germany. The European countries referred to here are the thirty-one countries mentioned by President Roosevelt in his telegram to Hitler and Mussolini on April 15. The Latin American countries are those that endorsed Roosevelt's telegram at the time. Observers believe that this action by the countries of the Western Hemisphere is clearly in support of Britain and France in their preparation to accept Hitler's proposal to conclude non-aggression treaties, as the countries accepting Hitler's request must either negotiate these non-aggression treaties and respect them, or bear the responsibility of rejecting peace talks. (30th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to news here today, Britain, France, Poland and several other countries will accept Hitler's invitation to conclude non-aggression pacts. However, efforts by Britain, France and Poland to contain Germany will continue without letup. It is said that the British government is giving special consideration to the expressions of goodwill towards Britain in Hitler's speech, studying the possibility of improving British-German relations. The British government will also ask Germany to explain the meaning of its so-called understanding between Britain and Germany. (30th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to diplomatic sources, Britain may join France in giving Germany assurances of non-aggression in order to counter Hitler's claim in his speech that democratic countries are trying to encircle Germany. It is believed that Hitler would find it difficult to reject such an assurance. Observers point out that this move by Britain and France is a natural follow-up to Roosevelt's peace appeal to Hitler and Mussolini. (30th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>America Must Strengthen Its Military to Cope with Future International Crises</h3>
<p>(Washington) As of yesterday, reactions from the US Congress and officials to Hitler's speech to the German Reichstag remained unusually divided. However, most well-informed sources believe that the Polish issue is particularly serious compared to all other European issues. This is because Hitler's statements and various actions regarding his policies, especially his attempts to abandon the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the German demands on Warsaw, require a decisive official response. The direct impact of Hitler's speech on the United States is to make the US focus on its military rearmament plan, emphasizing naval and air power to prepare for potential world crises. The US will continue to view with suspicion the political and economic tendencies of the Nazi and Fascist groups in South America. The government is expected to adopt a more flexible neutrality policy, so that it can provide greater substantial assistance to European democracies in the event of a war. Washington officials are said to be paying close attention to Japan's connection with the Rome-Berlin Axis, as there has been no clear indication of a non-European appeasement policy. Officials also stated that Hitler's speech places the international barometer just above the storm point. One official said that whether "we rise or fall depends on action, not just words." He also indicated that Poland is the immediate focal point for a potential crisis. (April 30, Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Baldwin Observes That a European War Is Almost Inevitable</h3>
<p>Whether Peace Can Be Achieved Depends on Hitler's Attitude</p>
<p>(New York) Lord Baldwin, former British Prime Minister, and his wife, after traveling through Canada to the United States, are scheduled to board the "Aquitania" ship here today to return home. Before his departure, he told reporters that President Roosevelt's telegram was a "courageous move." He believes that war is inevitable, and the key to whether the current problems can be resolved lies with the German leader Hitler alone. However, "no one can predict what Hitler intends to do in the future," he said. (April 20, Havas)</p>
<h3>German Army Commander-in-Chief Visits Rome</h3>
<p>Discussing Unified Military Command and Visiting North Africa</p>
<p>(Rome) General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, leading several officers, arrived here yesterday afternoon. This morning, he met with King Victor Emmanuel III and held a long conversation with Prime Minister Mussolini. It is scheduled that tomorrow he will fly to the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, accompanied by General Pariani, Minister of War and Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, to visit Governor Balbo. He is scheduled to stay there for six days. It is reported that the German and Italian generals will inspect various military facilities in Libya and study the strategic situation in North Africa. It is said that General Pariani recently went to Innsbruck, Austria, to talk with General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces. Now that General Brauchitsch has come to Italy, the goal is probably to change the existing German-Italian consultations into a military alliance treaty to respond to the collective security agreement to be established by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is also rumored that when war breaks out in the future, the German and Italian navies and armies will be unified in command to increase efficiency. After General Brauchitsch returns from Libya, he will talk with General Pariani, Chief of the General Staff, and Admiral Cavagnari, Minister of the Navy. This move may be related to the issue of unified command. It is even rumored that the German fleet cruising in the western Mediterranean will come to Italian ports before returning home.

<h3>New York World's Fair Opens, Roosevelt Delivers Speech, Saying the US Wishes to Maintain Close Ties with Peaceful Nations</h3>
<p>(New York) At the opening of the New York World's Fair today, President Roosevelt said in his speech that he often prays to God that the barriers to communication between many countries on the European continent, from which the Americans came to this hemisphere, can be broken down within a few years. The United States has always been connected with the stars of international goodwill, the most important of which is the star of peace. This exhibition has the theme of "The World of Tomorrow," and the world sees it as the highest and most optimistic gesture of the United States towards internationalism. It is said that the exhibition contains exhibits from 62 countries, which is the largest in the history of world's fairs. It is expected that the number of visitors today will exceed one million.</p>
<p>The New York World's Fair opened tonight, and its electric lights will be lit by cosmic rays from outside the solar system. Dr. Albert Einstein, a famous German scientist, used a device to extract cosmic rays and will deliver a speech that will be broadcast to the world via radio. At that time, the tall column in the center of the square will emit ten beams of light, the last of which will be as bright as one million 100-watt light bulbs. It will be visible for 20 miles around, and a bell will also sound, with its light also visible for 20 miles. (April 30, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Anti-Aggression Group Organized, British-Soviet Negotiations Take a Sharp Turn, Germany Extends Influence to Baltic Coast, Soviet Union Warns Latvia and Estonia</h3>
<p>(London) Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky met with British Foreign Secretary Halifax last night. It is said that Maisky suggested that Britain and France should send troops to guarantee the independence of countries bordering the western frontier of the Soviet Union when they are attacked by Germany. The countries listed by the Soviet Union for guarantees include Latvia, Estonia, and Finland in the Baltic Sea. After Britain and France assume this obligation, the Soviet Union is willing to form a military alliance with Britain and France. Whenever Germany attacks Britain, France, or the countries guaranteed by Britain and France, the Soviet Union is willing to send troops to assist. It is said that the Soviet Union is also willing to take joint action with Britain and France in the event of a German attack on Belgium, the Netherlands, or Switzerland. (April 30, Associated Press)</p>
<p>(Paris) The right-wing Parisian Echo newspaper recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent, stating that "The talks conducted by Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky with Foreign Secretary Halifax are of great importance. It is reported that the ambassador told Foreign Secretary Halifax that Soviet Russia suggested that measures should be taken to ensure the security of the Baltic coastal countries (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia). This suggestion has now been approved in principle by Poland. Regarding how the Soviet Union should provide assistance to Poland in the event of an invasion in the future, both parties have also agreed on a compromise plan, that is, the Soviet Union should supply Poland with raw materials and munitions, but its troops will not invade Polish territory. As for the proposal for the Soviet Air Force to assist Poland, it has not been completely abandoned. In addition, in terms of the Far East issue, the Soviet Union has reportedly agreed to deal with the European situation separately. If a Japanese newspaper also publishes a dispatch from its London correspondent, roughly stating that "The negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are about to produce concrete results. The Soviet Union previously proposed that the agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union should involve the threat posed by Japan to the eastern border of the Soviet Union. Up to now, given that Japan is focusing all its attention on China and has no time to spare, it is said that it is still hesitant to collude with the Axis powers of Germany and Italy to fight against European countries that love peace and are determined to resist aggression. If so, the Soviet Union can have no worries about the East and can only establish an agreement with Britain on the relationship in the West." The Progressive Socialist Party's newspaper, Affaires, reported that "The talks between British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday went smoothly. A thorough understanding between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is not far off. According to London's view, after Germany announced the abolition of the 1934 Polish-German Non-Aggression Pact, Poland had to rely on the Soviet Union." (April 30, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Observers here recently stated that Germany is continuing to pursue a policy of eastward expansion. After acquiring the Memel region, it is sending overtures to Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. This strategy has been detected by the Soviet government, which has filed representations with the governments of Latvia and Estonia, informing them that if they approach Germany in the future, the Soviet Union will regard it as an unfriendly act. As for the fact that the Soviet Union and Lithuania are not contiguous, it did not make the same representations to them, but if Germany were to use the Baltic coastal countries to directly or indirectly extend its influence to the Soviet border, it would not be tolerated by the Soviet Union. As of today, now that Germany has announced the abolition of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, not only has the possibility of Poland and the Soviet Union approaching each other increased, but the friendship between Poland and Hungary, which was originally very close, has also changed as a result. This is because the closer Hungary becomes to Germany in the future, the more difficult it will be for Poland to maintain its original relationship with it. In short, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe originally held a hesitant attitude towards the two major European groups. Now, after Hitler's speech, these countries can clearly decide what to do. (April 30, Havas)</p>
<h3>Poland Notifies France of Its Determination to Resist Aggression, The Lesson of the Fall of Czechoslovakia Is Not Far Away, Seeking a Fair Solution to the Danzig Problem</h3>
<p>(Paris) Poland formally notified France last night that it was determined to oppose Germany's annexation of Danzig or the Polish Corridor. The Polish note stated that Hitler's attempt to abolish the Polish-German friendship treaty would in no way diminish Poland's belief in its own strength and its reliance on the guarantees made by Britain and France. Some believe that this note is to warn Britain and France, hoping that they are prepared to fulfill their obligations to Poland once Germany attacks Danzig and the Polish Corridor. (April 30, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Warsaw Politicians have commented on the relationship between Poland and Germany, saying that although the Czech Republic made various concessions, it was still unable to avoid the disaster of partition. The lesson is not far away, and Poland must defend itself. However, regarding the two issues of the Free City of Danzig and the construction of a highway by Germany through the Polish Corridor, Poland is still willing to consider a fair solution in a spirit of understanding, so that both parties can accept it. Foreign Minister Beck, after visiting the United Kingdom in early April, has repeatedly tried to talk with German Ambassador Moltke for this purpose, but he has not been able to do so because the ambassador has returned to his country to report on his duties. At this moment, the Polish government is actively making preparations in military and economic terms to prevent problems before they arise. This can be seen in the air combat exercise to be held tomorrow at the Gdynia airfield. (April 29, Havas)</p>
<h3>Polish Authorities Consider Reply to Germany, Beck to Announce Policy Toward Germany in Parliament</h3>
<p>Warsaw After Germany abolished the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, the Polish government has convened a joint meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives on May 5 to hear Foreign Minister Beck's speech and the government's reply. Although the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are scheduled to meet first on May 2, Foreign Minister Beck will not reveal the contents of the reply. He will only announce it to the diplomatic corps and reporters at the joint meeting of the Senate and the House of Representatives on May 5. In short, the Foreign Minister will follow the example of German leader Hitler, and the reply will be sent to the German government a few minutes before the speech is delivered. (April 30, Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw It is currently stated by officials that Hitler's statement in yesterday's speech that he had proposed a twenty-five-year non-aggression pact to Poland and that Germany, Poland, and Hungary had jointly guaranteed Slovakia is not true. Hitler is simply trying to create difficulties between Britain and Poland. Polish officials have not changed their attitude towards Germany's demand for Danzig to return to Germany and for the construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor to reach Danzig. If Hitler wants to scare Poland with this, he will fail. According to the Warsaw Daily, the sales of Polish national defense bonds have increased greatly after Hitler's speech. As far as is known, officials have not yet adopted new defense measures. (April 29, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Germany Uses Both Threats and Enticements on Poland</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After German leader Hitler delivered his speech, newspapers and Nazi Party members said that Poland should no longer reject "Germany's final and generous proposal." It is clear that Germany will take action against Poland before this autumn. Nazi Party members even declared that "this proposal to Poland must be accepted immediately, otherwise it will become a fait accompli in an instant, and there will be no regrets." This is the same as the warning issued by the party to Czechoslovakia last year. Party members also said that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csaky are now in Berlin, holding talks with German authorities. This move is tantamount to warning Poland that Hungary's friendship is unreliable. Moreover, according to unconfirmed reports, Prime Minister Teleki brought a proposal approved by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, advocating that Slovakia be merged into Hungarian territory, and that this be used as an exchange condition for Germany's wishes for Poland. The Italian side has also directly advised Poland that "the current environment is already unsustainable, and Poland should not stubbornly stick to its prejudices and bring trouble upon itself." In short, it is generally believed here that Poland may accept the final proposal put forward by Hitler, but Britain must give a negative answer to Germany's abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the resumption of negotiations. In fact, the leaders of the Nazi Party do not expect Britain and Poland to provide answers. The reason for acting in this way is obviously to reserve a loophole, so that when they take action in the future, they can use the excuse that other countries refused to accept their generous proposals and attribute all responsibility to other countries. This is Germany's intention. (April 29, Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw According to news from Italy and Germany, the British government recently sent a note to Poland, roughly stating that the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain and Poland was not intended to encourage Poland to adopt a tough attitude and refuse to accept "Germany's reasonable and fair proposals." This statement has been denied by the semi-official Patriotic News Agency. The British government did not submit such a note. At the time of the establishment of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain and Poland, Germany had already made proposals on the two issues of the Free City of Danzig and the construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor, and Poland had also stated its position. As for Germany's promise to guarantee Poland's border for a period of 25 years, the German government had never formally proposed it before Hitler's speech on April 28. In addition, the Pat Agency also denied the news from the German side that the Italian government had advised the Polish government that Poland's "situation is unsustainable, and if it continues to stick to its prejudices, it may lead to a crisis."

<h3>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Busily Travels</h3>
<p>Actively Engaged in Diplomatic Activities with Small Balkan Countries</p>
<p>(Istanbul, Turkey) The new German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, presented his credentials to President Ismet this morning. Yesterday afternoon, the President met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin and had talks. It is reported that Potemkin will travel to the capital of Bulgaria, and it is possible that he will also go to Romania. Diplomatic circles here are paying close attention to this trip. Officials have remained absolutely silent about the goal of this trip so far, but well-informed sources say that the Soviet Union is unwilling to interfere in any issues within the scope of the Balkan Peninsula, and the initial motivation for Potemkin's trip is probably to visit and investigate. However, since Germany extended its influence to the Black Sea, the Soviet Union has shifted its attention to Bulgaria. Potemkin's trip to that country shows that the Soviet Union's attitude towards Balkan affairs is about to become more active. In addition, the Soviet Union and Turkey both have common interests in the Black Sea, and their relationship is very close. This is a very important factor in the diplomatic activities of organizing an anti-aggression group. (April 30, Havas)</p>
<h3>Papen Meets Turkish President to Present Credentials</h3>
<p>Istanbul The new German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, met with Turkish President Ismet yesterday morning to present his credentials. Papen conveyed Hitler's friendship and goodwill to the Turkish President and said, "This ambassador will devote himself to developing friendship between the two countries and promoting cultural and economic relations between Turkey and Germany." (April 30, Huitong)</p>
<h3>Important Changes Among Russian Naval Leaders</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The following senior Soviet naval officers have recently been reassigned: (1) Naval People's Commissar Frinovsky has resigned. His vacancy has been filled by Admiral Kuznetsov, Commander of the Pacific Fleet. (2) Naval People's Commissariat members Shaposhnikov and Smirnov have been dismissed at the same time. Their vacancies have been filled by Reivkenko, Commander of the Baltic Fleet, and Rogoten, Director of the Political Bureau of the Naval People's Commissariat. (3) Naval People's Commissar Deputy Isakov has been promoted to First Deputy Commissar of the Naval People's Commissariat. (April 9, Havas)</p>
<h3>French and Polish Talks Fruitful, Romanian Foreign Minister Leaves Paris for Rome to Consult</h3>
<p>(Paris) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu left here today for Rome to continue his tour of European capitals. After Rome, he plans to go to the capital of Yugoslavia. Gafencu expressed his satisfaction with the results of his talks in London and Paris, saying that he was deeply moved by Britain and France's great aspirations for peace. A communiqué issued here today stated that the French-Romanian talks allowed for a thorough study of all relations between the two countries, and emphasized the maintenance of European peace. French and Polish diplomatic authorities were pleased to find that their opinions coincided. (April 9, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Rome) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu has departed from Paris and come here to hold talks with Italian authorities. Fascist Party members attach great importance to this, hoping that the outcome of the talks will allow Romania to join the German-Italian Axis, so that the oil produced in that country can be controlled by Germany and Italy. They also said that since Italy supported Hungary's demands for border revisions, the friendship between Romania and Italy has been affected. It is hoped that Hungary and Romania can reach a compromise on the Hungarian minority issue in Outer Transylvania (which belonged to Hungary before the European War), which will benefit Romanian-Italian relations. Regarding the Romanian oil issue, the tone of Italian newspapers is noteworthy. For example, the Fascist Party's newspaper "Del Viale" studied the importance of Romanian oil in wartime, roughly stating that Romania ranks fifth among the world's oil-producing countries, and Germany and [Austria-]Hungary occupied it during the European War because of their need for oil. "Now that Germany and Italy are launching a counterattack against Britain's encirclement policy, although there are not many days left, they have resolved several problems. How can they admit failure on the Romanian issue?" (April 9, Havas)</p>
<h3>German-Hungarian Talks Seek to Promote Hungarian Understanding</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Although the contents of the German-Hungarian talks were not announced last night, political circles here believe that economic issues must occupy an important position. This can be inferred from the two decisions of Hungarian politicians to meet with General Göring, the economic dictator of four years. German-Hungarian economic relations are now very prosperous, and trade figures have increased fourfold compared to 1933. In the future, systematic development should be sought. Economic circles hinted that Germany and Hungary may sign an agreement similar in nature to the German-Romanian commercial agreement, so as to develop Hungarian production and promote it in the German market. It is generally believed that in addition to economic issues, the relationship between Hungary and Yugoslavia will also be considered. German foreign policy has always been based on promoting an understanding between Hungary and Yugoslavia, with Hungary giving up its territorial demands and Yugoslavia guaranteeing its Hungarian minority. If so, Yugoslavia will definitely be able to join the International Anti-Communist Pact. (April 30, Huitong)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Result in Agreement to Cooperate in Aiding China; Anti-Aggression Bloc Does Not Include the Far East; Britain to Expand Financial Aid to China</h3>
<p>(London) After the Soviet Ambassador Maisky returned to his post from Moscow yesterday, he visited senior officials of the Foreign Office today for talks. The Sunday Times commented on this matter, stating that regarding the issue of forming an anti-aggression bloc, an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union is imminent. Germany's attempt to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan into a military alliance has reportedly been rejected by Japan. However, if Britain and the Soviet Union cooperate not only in Europe but also take united action in the Far East, Japan might change its attitude. Although the Soviet Union once insisted that the Far East should be included in the anti-aggression bloc, it no longer does so. The reason for this is that Britain and the Soviet Union have already reached an agreement on providing aid to China. It can be asserted that Britain will expand its financial aid to China in the short term. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Resentment Intensifies; Incitement Against Britain</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although Japanese newspapers have been extremely hostile to the deployment of the American fleet to the Pacific in the past week, their antipathy towards Britain is even greater. According to the Miyako Shimbun, "The United States is clearly being used by Britain, and there is no doubt that Britain intends to stand in opposition to Japan. Therefore, the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly tense. Although Japan does not like war, if forced to do so, Japan will not hesitate in the slightest. In short, Britain's support for General Chiang Kai-shek is a major cause of a potential Anglo-Japanese war." The newspaper further stated, "Although there is no animosity between the United States and Japan, it is regrettable that the United States is being used by Britain in the Far East." According to the Kokumin Shimbun, Britain's cooperation with the Soviet Union is clearly an anti-Japanese act. If Britain continues to do so, "Japan's anti-British sentiment will inevitably increase." It is expected that the Japanese authorities will take retaliatory action against British interests in China. (Associated Press Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Implementing Japanese Military Budget; Wartime Prices Soar; Impact on Industrial Production</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The implementation of Japan's huge military budget is currently encountering many difficult problems domestically. The increased demand for military materials is the main cause of the rising prices of various materials. All materials needed to manufacture goods that are also needed by the arms industry are increasing in price. According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, if this upward trend continues unabated, "the implementation of the government's low-price policy will be hindered." The newspaper supports the deep concern of the Japanese Army and Navy authorities in implementing measures to reduce the prices of military materials. The Japanese Navy authorities recently stated at a meeting with leaders of private arms factories that there is a need for an automatic price reduction of at least ten percent in arms prices. At the same time, they instructed relevant naval officers to monitor the implementation of price reductions for military supplies. The Army authorities are cooperating with the Navy and are currently carefully considering how to reduce the prices of their huge consumption of materials, and are discussing: (1) reducing prices, (2) establishing an official system for reviewing the accounts of private arms factories, (3) reducing the dividends issued by these factories, and (4) promoting savings among arms manufacturing workers. Army Minister Itagaki firmly stated that adjusting the prices of military materials is of utmost importance for the smooth implementation of the military budget and the adjustment of arms manufacturing materials. The way this matter is handled will determine the success or failure of the government's wartime price policy. Due to the surge in demand for military materials and commodities necessary for implementing the government's plan to expand national productive capacity, prices in Japan have been soaring for some time. The quantity of materials consumed by the military and the government was already large. Judging from the current situation, the quantity of materials needed by the Army in this newly started fiscal year will be even greater than before. Unless the authorities make a firm resolution to reduce the prices of military materials, how to supply this year's military needs will be a difficult problem to solve satisfactorily. Since the China Incident has entered the stage where Japan is conducting military operations, construction work must also be undertaken. Therefore, in the next few years, the number of war materials and commodities needed for the expansion of productive capacity program will be very large. Therefore, from the perspective of ensuring the supply of these materials, stabilizing people's lives, and maintaining social order, reducing the unit price of military materials is a matter of urgency. Otherwise, there will be no way to rectify the current situation of the arms industry's prosperity while other industries are in recession, and to prevent malignant inflation.

<h3>U.S. to Impose Punitive Tariffs on Japanese Goods; Treasury Investigating Japanese Import Trade</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news from here today, the Treasury Department is currently investigating goods imported into the United States from Japan and Italy. It is likely that a 25% punitive tariff will be imposed on Japanese and Italian goods, as the United States has already increased this punitive tariff on most German goods. Treasury officials also stated that they are currently studying the strict exchange control measures of various countries and are looking for evidence of Japanese dumping of Japanese goods in the United States, so that the President will have more reasons to implement punitive tariffs on Japanese goods. Various parties here believe that the Treasury Department's current work is the United States' preparation to take similar retaliatory actions against Japan's undermining of American interests in China. Regardless of Congress's intentions, the U.S. government has the right to take this action. It is only necessary for the Treasury Department to present evidence that Japan is violating American trade rules, and the President can reduce Japan's trade with the United States. For example, the punitive tariff currently levied by the United States on goods imported from Germany was not passed by Congress. Judging from this, it will not be difficult for the U.S. government to impose similar punitive tariffs on Japanese and Italian goods. Therefore, regardless of whether Congress can pass the Pittman Act, Japanese goods imported into the United States will inevitably be subject to restrictions. (Associated Press Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Philippine Industrialist's Prediction; The Future of the Philippines</h3>
<p>San Francisco: Mr. Masman, a former president of the Mining Association and capitalist from Manila, told reporters today that he was concerned about Japan's deep penetration into South China and the country's southern expansion policy, saying, "Due to the Philippines' geographical location, Japan may attempt to seize the Philippines before attacking Indochina or the Dutch East Indies." Mr. Masman arrived here yesterday from Manila and is en route to New York. (Associated Press Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia: A Triune Kingdom</h3>
<p>Italy's decision to annex Albania is both to consolidate its position in the Mediterranean and to threaten Yugoslavia. Several years ago, Italy instructed Albania to build military roads directly to the border of the southern country, indicating that Italy had long coveted it. When the invasion occurred, Britain and France declared their guarantee of the independence of Poland, Greece, and Romania, but did not mention or consider the difficult situation of Yugoslavia, perhaps because they did not want to add to the trouble. Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania are all members of the Little Entente. Since Czechoslovakia was annexed, its northern border has been controlled by the Nazis, while its western coast and southern border are threatened by Italy. The port of Zara on the Adriatic coast has also been ceded to Italy. In the east, it has old grievances with Hungary and Bulgaria due to border issues. On the other hand, internally, there are many ethnic complexities and divisions. Considering the demise of Czechoslovakia, one cannot help but worry about the future of Yugoslavia. The land of Yugoslavia was originally part of Turkish territory. The Treaty of Berlin in 1878 stipulated that Serbia should secede from Turkey and become independent. Prince Milan Obrenović declared independence in Belgrade and established the Kingdom of Serbia. In 1882, he added the title of King. Later, the Slovaks, Croats, Dalmatians, and Bosnians revolted in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and declared independence. In 1918, they merged with Serbia and Montenegro to form the triune Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which is Yugoslavia. Therefore, in addition to the aforementioned ethnic groups, there are also Romanians, Albanians, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Hungarians, Jews, etc. Its area is 96,737 square miles, and its population is over 14 million. Serbs account for over 5 million, Croats over 4 million, and Germans 500,000. Although the constitution stipulates that all ethnic groups are equal, the King is the former ruler of Serbia, and the majority of cabinet members are also Serbs, so other ethnic groups are not satisfied. The Croats, whose culture and industry are more advanced than the Serbs, have repeatedly demanded autonomy, which is a hidden reef in Yugoslavia's internal politics. Recently, a compromise has been reached to grant the Croats autonomy. Yugoslavia's ethnic groups are complex, and the education of its people is relatively backward in Europe. According to a survey in 1931, the illiteracy rate in the country was still 45% of the total population. Its mineral and industrial production is far inferior to that of Czechoslovakia. Farmers account for 80% of the population, and only 30% of the country's land is cultivated. The total value of international trade is only 100 million U.S. dollars a year, which is only one-third of that of Czechoslovakia. In terms of military strength, although it can mobilize one million people in wartime, it may be difficult to maintain peace for long under the watchful eyes of the fascists. Several years ago, France was very close to Yugoslavia in order to prevent Italy. In October 1924, King Alexander I of Yugoslavia formally returned the visit to France, but he was assassinated upon landing in Marseille. The current King Peter II is his son. Italy has recently been seeking to benefit from the South. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano met with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister in Venice, and Yugoslavia's compromise with Italy has been realized. Germany is also trying to win over Yugoslavia in order to divide the Little Entente in the Balkans. Whether Yugoslavia will further join the Anti-Comintern Pact is very important to the current situation in the Balkans, but according to reports, Yugoslavia has rejected it.</p>
<h3>French Newspaper in Nanjing Sympathizes with China's Resistance; Punished with a Ten-Day Suspension</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The French newspaper "Journal de Shanghai," published here, was suspended for ten days yesterday for publishing an article on the war in China. The author of the article, Dr. Roul Pia, expressed pessimism about Japan's current situation, stating that China is not comparable to Albania, and Japan has now tasted this bitterness and paid a huge price for the lessons it has learned. There is a saying in the Far East that one should die with a smile. Japan's forced support is probably like that. (Reuters Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Europe Launches Debt Repayment Movement; Romanian Government Notifies U.S. Envoy; Ready to Open Negotiations with the U.S.</h3>
<p>Bucharest, Romania: The Romanian government recently notified the U.S. envoy to Romania, declaring that the government is prepared to begin negotiations with the U.S. government immediately on the issue of war debt repayment. U.S. diplomatic circles had predicted several months ago that European countries would begin this debt repayment movement because U.S. law prohibits lending money to countries that have not repaid their previous debts, and these countries are now threatened by war. If Romania's negotiations are successful, the actions that Britain and France will take are of great interest to the general public. The British House of Commons will convene a meeting this week to discuss the issue of war debts. Observers generally believe that European countries are now trying to resolve the issue of war debts with the U.S. so that they can borrow money from the U.S. in the next major war. After the war, most European countries failed to repay their war debts to the United States as scheduled. (Associated Press Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>United States Intensifies Military Expansion; Adding Two New Battleships; Funding Under Review</h3>

The bill also approves the purchase of 250 new naval aircraft and the construction of six destroyers and six submarines. (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Inventors of New War Equipment Eager to Offer Advice to the Government</h3>
<p>Washington: Since the U.S. government launched an expansion of its army and navy, inventors across the country have been offering the Department of the Army methods for manufacturing new types of war equipment and submitting drawings. There are often as many as a thousand cases each month. The construction of new guns, cannons, bombs, aircraft, and other weapons is almost a daily occurrence. According to a department member speaking to news reporters, nearly half of them are of no value, but there are indeed many worth studying, which are currently under close investigation. One inventor suggested building extremely large railroads to carry the U.S. fleet across the continent without having to pass through the Panama Canal. Another inventor suggested reviving the war helmets used by ancient Roman soldiers, improving them to withstand machine gun bullets. (Reuters Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Pittman Argues U.S. Silver Purchase Law Should Be Maintained</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, yesterday urged the Senate Silver Committee to maintain the silver purchase bill because silver occupies an important position in wartime. During the European war, India's lack of revolution was due to the high price of silver, and silver will occupy an even more important position in future wars. Economist Delant also said, "War often increases the need for silver, and although there are no legislative regulations in circulation in the international market, prices will naturally rise."

<h3>Chinese Army in Shanxi Province Has Gained the Initiative; Guerrillas Briefly Entered Hunyuan; Retreating After Burning Japanese Warehouses</h3>
<p>Xingji: The Chinese army guerrillas in the Yanbei area have repeatedly performed miraculous feats. Due to transportation blockades, news is delayed. According to a forward report, a Chinese guerrilla unit attacked Hunyuan on the night of the 13th, entered the city at midnight, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat for three hours, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers, unable to withstand the attack, abandoned the city and fled. The Chinese side obtained many spoils of war. Hunyuan is the gateway to Datong. All sides are surrounded by Japanese troops. The Chinese side, finding it inconvenient to defend for long, burned the Japanese warehouses and withdrew at dawn. (Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Xingji: The situation in Shanxi is improving. The attacking units have gradually gained the initiative. The results of the battle in southern Shanxi are good. The tasks of attrition and annihilation have been achieved. The Japanese army is in a dilemma, like fish in a cauldron. Strategically, the Chinese army has achieved a major victory. The Japanese army's offensive has sharply decreased, and most of them are firmly defending their strongholds and adopting a defensive posture. In the past two days, only small units have been maneuvering for guerrilla warfare, so there has been no major contact. There have been no changes in the northern sections of the Zhengtai and Tongpu railways. On the night of the 25th, there was fierce fighting all night in the Heilongguan area. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly, and fighting continued until noon on the 26th. The Japanese army in the Yuncheng area of southern Shanxi attempted to counterattack. The Chinese army has been closely monitoring. There has been no contact in Hejin, Jishan, and other places. (Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Xingji: Over a hundred Japanese soldiers from Pianguan advanced towards Hequ on the morning of the 26th. The Chinese army ambushed them in the Yaowangping Changyagou area. By evening, the Japanese army had occupied Yaowangping and continued to invade westward. After the Chinese reinforcements bravely counterattacked, the Japanese army retreated to Yaowangping Yangjialing, where they confronted the Chinese army. There has been no change as of noon on the 27th. Over a hundred Japanese soldiers from Shenchi moved towards Wuzhai in two directions on the 26th. The Japanese army from Jingle also divided into groups and invaded westward, appearing to attack Lanxian. The Chinese army is dividing its forces to counterattack. (Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Annual Conference of the Textile Society Held in Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The 7th Annual Conference of the Chinese Textile Society was held in Chongqing on the 30th. Minister Chen attended and delivered a speech, elaborating on the importance of establishing a self-sufficient economic policy in our country and hoping that the textile industry would pay attention to the widespread development of rural industries throughout the country to solve the current difficulties in clothing materials.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Zhongxiang Failed to Cross the River</h3>
<p>Yicheng: There are signs of a resurgence of fighting in central Hubei. Since the 27th, the Japanese have been continuously reinforcing their troops. At the same time, the Japanese troops on the front line have been moving busily. More than a thousand new Japanese troops have been added to the area from Haojiadian in Suixian County to Xujiazhai. More than a thousand Japanese troops have also been added to Huayuan Anlu. Seven or eight hundred Japanese troops from Ying Mountain moved to Maping yesterday. More than a thousand Japanese troops from Anlu opened to Xihe Leigongdian yesterday. Today, more than two hundred Japanese troops have contacted the Chinese army and were killed by the Chinese army, fifty or sixty people. The remnants retreated to the southeast. There are five Japanese cannons in Maping, which fired five or six hundred shells at Huadushan (more than ten miles north of Maping) today. Yesterday, more than two hundred Japanese troops attempted to cross the river in the Zhongxian area but were repelled by the Chinese army. Today, the Japanese army still intends to cross the river, but because the Chinese army gave them artillery fire first, the Japanese have not succeeded. (Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing Dispatch: Yesterday, the Japanese army at Zhongbu Wharf on the Xiang River in central Hubei used six cannons to fiercely bombard the Chinese side to cover two hundred infantrymen in a forced crossing of the river.

<h3>Xikang Province; Establishment of the Chairman's Headquarters</h3>
<p>Developing Resources in Ningyuan and Yajiang Areas; Zhang Bochang Appointed as Director</p>
<p>Kangding Correspondence: Xikang is the most resource-rich and undeveloped region in the southwestern border area. It is not only an important stronghold for national defense at present but also the center of future international transportation. The Ningyuan and Yajiang areas, which were划入康省之寗雅兩屬, are very rich in resources. Xichang is the hub of Ningyuan, and the border area of Sichuan, Kang, and Yunnan provinces is very important. The authorities recently set up the Military Affairs Committee Chairman's Xichang Headquarters here, which shows the authorities' intention to consolidate the frontier and enrich national defense. After the newly appointed Headquarters Director Zhang Bochang was ordered to take office, he departed from Chongqing for Kang. When he passed through Chengdu, people from more than ten counties in the Ningyuan and Yajiang areas who were traveling in Chengdu expressed their great pleasure that the Central Government had set up the Chairman's Headquarters in Xichang to promote the construction of the Southwest. They held a welcome meeting and suggested opinions for reference. Zhang then took a car to the west. Because he had to discuss everything with Kang Chairman Liu Wenhui, he detoured to the province when passing through Ya'an. According to Zhang's talk about his views on Ningyuan, he said that the establishment of the Xichang Headquarters is actually to develop resources in the Ningyuan and Yajiang areas. Agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other industries in the area are quite developed, and gold, copper, iron, coal, and other minerals are also produced. The development plan has been roughly formulated, and he plans to start with transportation construction, actively building roads, and plans to establish an industrial technical school in Ningyuan to cultivate border talents in agriculture, forestry, mining, etc. In addition, another group of experts is engaged in surveying and exploration in order to develop and increase production. He met with Chairman Liu yesterday and will have to stay here for a few more days before going directly to Xichang.</p>
<h3>Chaoshan Deploys Resistance Defense Line</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Attempts to Invade Chaoshan on May 1st; Japanese Planes Fly Over Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Other Areas to Xiamen</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: In late March, Chaoshan and other places repeatedly cracked Japanese sabotage agencies and captured more than ten spies, who confessed that the traitors planned to cause trouble everywhere on May 1st to cater to the Japanese army invading from the Fujian border. Chaoshan Garrison Commander Hua Zhenzhong, in order to plan for everything, forcibly dispersed the population and materials from April 20th. The Shantou market is now in a state of war.</p>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on April 24th, a total of 24 Japanese bombers and fighter planes flew from the Guangzhou sea via Zijin, Wuhua, Fengshun, Meixian, and Dapu to western Fujian, seemingly flying to Xiamen. On the same day, a Japanese destroyer was moored in the Lingdong Sea, off the Dachahe ferry. Judging from the Japanese side's current actions, there seems to be no sign of an invasion of Shantou, but the military authorities are not relaxing their preparations in any way. The first line of defense configuration along the coast has been completed recently, and the combat configuration of the second defense line is also being completed quickly. Chao'an, Jieyang, and other places have been划入 second defense line. Large troops have been building trenches and other defensive works in various places in recent days. Anbu, Fort, Guanbu, and other towns have also been ordered to evacuate the people. The light vehicle road from Shantou to Chenghai was ordered to be completely destroyed within three days from the 25th. The Chaoshan Railway will be destroyed after receiving the order from the war zone headquarters. The Chenghai local team and police, under the command of County Mayor Bian Zhishan from the 24th to the 29th, conducted live-fire shooting on the Huafu Township embankment and near the city, along the Waisha Township Guanshan Township area. Women and children in the coastal villages had long since been evacuated, leaving only the strong men's team, with the provincial government sending inspector Shen Ziqing to Chenghai for guidance. Hui Chao Mei Garrison Commander Zou Hong arrived in Shantou on the 24th to attend the ceremony for Hua Zhenzhong's assumption of the post of garrison commander and then rushed to Chao'an Dapu and other places for inspection on the 25th. Accompanying Zou was Guo Siyan, the former commander of the Humen Fortress. After losing Humen, there was talk of being wanted for investigation. Now, he is appearing in Chaoshan, or he has been granted a chance to make amends for his crimes. The population of Chaoyang, Huilai, and Lufeng counties continued to evacuate from the 26th.</p>

<p>（四）打仗，使得球員們集中在香港，今年的足球賽，因而更見熱鬧，足球總會賺了錢，笑口常開，南華會賺了錢，認為流年好、六大錦標華人隊有包辦的把握，球迷們化了錢喊聲痛快，滿意得火氣亦减少了。</p>
<p>(4) The war has caused players to concentrate in Hong Kong, making this year's football matches even livelier. The Football Association is making money and is all smiles. The South China Athletic Association is making money and believes it's a lucky year. They are confident that Chinese teams can take all six major championships. Fans are spending money and shouting with joy, so satisfied that their tempers have also lessened.</p>
<p>李惠堂是聰明人，現在因為踢了十幾年球，相當的「麥克麥克」了，平時坐着一輛不大不小的汽車（號碼四九四九）派頭十足。看看今年來香港的高等難民多，機會難再，於是乎東山再起，名利雙收，何樂而不為。高興的時候，寫幾篇稿子，往中央社一送，隔日各報競刋，互相利用利用，彼此心中有數。</p>
<p>Li Huitang is a smart man. Now, because he has been playing football for over a decade, he is quite "Mike Mike" [wealthy]. Usually, he sits in a car of moderate size (license plate 4949) with a full demeanor. Seeing the many high-level refugees coming to Hong Kong this year, an opportunity not to be missed, he has made a comeback, gaining both fame and fortune. Why not? When he's happy, he writes a few manuscripts, sends them to the Central News Agency, and the next day, newspapers compete to publish them, each using the other to their advantage, and both sides are aware of it.</p>
<p>不過，李惠堂亦有他的福氣，活該耍走運，說來亦奇怪，老李不踢則巳，一踢終有紀錄的，可是，平心而論，老李假使沒有馮景祥的輸送得宜，恐怕亦不見得如此容易，所謂牡丹雖好，尙須綠葉扶持。</p>
<p>However, Li Huitang also has his good fortune and deserves to have good luck. It's strange to say, but if Old Li doesn't kick, that's it, but if he does kick, there's always a record. But, in all fairness, if Old Li didn't have Feng Jingxiang's proper support, it probably wouldn't be so easy. As the saying goes, even a beautiful peony still needs green leaves to support it.</p>
<p>由此，又想到那位新李惠堂謝慶福來了，老謝，比從前（三四年前）心廣體胖了，身村相當的魁梧，惟高度比較眞李惠堂差一些，脚頭挺硬的，頭頂功夫亦稱上好；還有一位，敎人怪想念的，中堅朱成貴，滿塲飛馳，位置好，脚頭好，截奪好，輸送好，眞是一個好人兒。</p>
<p>From this, I'm reminded of the new Li Huitang, Xie Qingfu, who has arrived. Old Xie has become more carefree and portly than before (three or four years ago). He has a rather robust physique, but is slightly shorter than the real Li Huitang. His kicking is quite strong, and his header skills are also considered excellent. There's also one that people strangely miss, the center-back Zhu Chenggui, who flies around the field, has good positioning, good kicking, good interception, and good passing. He's truly a good person.</p>
<p>（五）上海人當還　得，當年的四騎士（李天生·譚江柏·馮景祥·葉北華）英勇的故事，事到如今，李天生和馮景祥仍舊紅得發紫，雖然上了年紀，球藝却更圓滑了，眞够得上「爐火純靑四個字。</p>
<p>(5) Shanghainese should still remember the heroic stories of the Four Knights (Li Tiansheng, Tan Jiangbai, Feng Jingxiang, and Ye Beihua) from those years. Even now, Li Tiansheng and Feng Jingxiang are still very popular. Although they are older, their football skills have become even more refined, truly worthy of the words "reaching a state of perfection."</p>
<p>江柏現在昆明，偶爾亦玩玩票，談不到大刀闊斧了。葉北華却因戰事影響，從廣東來到了香港，南華會慕名而請之，從此重作馮婦，磨刀再上前綫。當星中華第三戰時，曾代表華聯一度上塲，可是脚頭生疏，往昔威風，大為减色。</p>
<p>Jiang Bai is now in Kunming, occasionally playing for fun, but it's nothing grand. Ye Beihua, however, came to Hong Kong from Guangdong due to the war. The South China Athletic Association invited him out of admiration, and he has since returned to playing, sharpening his sword to return to the front lines. During the third battle of Singapore vs. China, he once represented the Chinese team, but his kicking was rusty, and his former glory was greatly diminished.</p>
<p>聽說：南華會將乘夏季之空閒，還要到南洋去跑一趟，趕空檔，賺外快」，生財有大道。葉北華見獵心喜，連日埋頭苦練，準備一顯身手，俾名利而雙收。</p>
<p>It is said that the South China Athletic Association will take advantage of the summer break to make a trip to Southeast Asia to fill the gap and earn extra money. There's a great way to make money. Ye Beihua is excited by this opportunity and has been practicing hard day after day, preparing to show off his skills and gain both fame and fortune.</p>
<p>原來，南華的遠征，與分錢的時候，頗有一說的價値，莫慶雖是軍師，却亦是一個獨裁者，每到賽終結賬的時候，先提出一筆「底錢，」譬如每人一百元，大家一律待遇。此外，就耍單看莫慶的手法了，先拿一枝紅筆，在白紙上東割劃西劃劃，對你高興，畫上幾十分，不高興，送你一個湯欄，然後就憑道一些洋碼子，按數分錢，分得多是你有運氣，分得少是你有霉氣，你想反抗，白費，好在南華名氣大，不怕你不靠着他。</p>
<p>Originally, there's quite a story to tell about South China's expeditions and how the money is divided. Although Mo Qing is the strategist, he is also a dictator. Every time the accounts are settled at the end of a tournament, he first proposes a "base amount," for example, 100 yuan per person, which everyone receives equally. After that, it depends on Mo Qing's methods. He first takes a red pen and scribbles on a white sheet of paper. If he likes you, he draws a few dozen points; if he doesn't, he gives you a zero. Then, based on some foreign figures, he distributes the money accordingly. Getting a lot means you're lucky; getting little means you're unlucky. If you want to resist, it's a waste of time. Fortunately, South China has a big reputation and isn't afraid that you won't rely on it.</p>
<p>總而會之，每當拔師出征的時候，大家因為眼前發着光，無不一團和氣，毫無意見，前隙盡忘。反之，當班師回朝的時候，各懷鬼胎，小伙子肚中多少有點火氣。幸虧獨裁者槍法好，使得你敢怒而不敢吵，敢氣而不敢走。下次再幹時，照樣大家很高興的去，閙着　扭回來。</p>
<p>In summary, whenever the team sets out on an expedition, everyone is excited about the prospects, and they are all in harmony, forgetting past grievances. Conversely, when the team returns, everyone has their own agenda, and the young men are somewhat angry. Fortunately, the dictator is good at handling things, so you dare to be angry but not argue, dare to be upset but not leave. Next time, everyone is still happy to go, making a scene to get back what they lost.</p>
<p>不過，有個例外，包家平·李天生·馮景祥·因為是老人，同時亦不失為一顆搖錢樹，當然特別要客氣些。</p>
<p>However, there's an exception. Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, and Feng Jingxiang, because they are older and still serve as cash cows, are naturally treated with special politeness.</p>
<p>馮最祥·這傢伙，脚色相當厲害，不但踢得一脚好球，而且懂得做「人家」，開了一爿西餐館，憑他三個名字的號召，生意着實不退板，手頭着實有　鈿，可稱為小康之家了。（續完）</p>
<p>Feng Zuixiang, this fellow, is quite capable. Not only is he good at playing football, but he also knows how to be "a person," opening a Western restaurant. With the appeal of his three names, business is definitely steady, and he definitely has money, which can be called a comfortable middle-class life. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Today is "May 1st" International Labor Day, a glorious anniversary of the international workers' struggle for the eight-hour system and demands for victory. Labor circles in various countries are holding grand and enthusiastic celebrations on this day. In this city, before the war, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions would also convene all Shanghai labor circles to hold enthusiastic commemorations. However, this year, due to the extraordinary times and the harsh environment, labor circles throughout the city are unwilling to adopt hypocritical and extravagant ceremonies, but are commemorating this great festival with a firm and calm attitude. Workers in various factories in this city are taking a holiday as usual. Various labor groups have issued a letter to all workers in the city and sent telegrams to labor groups in countries such as England, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, requesting them to jointly resist the aggressors in the Far East, assist China, strive for final victory, and seek the extension of world justice and the sure guarantee of human peace. The letter from various worker groups in this city to the workers and the telegrams to international labor groups are excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>勗勉工友努力生產</p>
<p>Encouraging Workers to Work Hard and Increase Production</p>
<p>（一）中國工友欲求自身痛苦之解除、首在力爭民族之獨立自由與平等、因剝削中國工友之利益者、並非國內之資本家、而為當前强暴之侵略者、故我國主權領土、獲得完整獨立後、工友之福利問題、即可迎刃而解（二）在此全面抗戰期間、勞工同胞、應深切瞭解勞資協調之重要、努力增加生產、促進經濟建設、務求物力、財力·之充實與雄　、以為長期抗戰必需之資源</p>
<p>(1) If Chinese workers want to relieve their own suffering, the first step is to strive for national independence, freedom, and equality. The interests of Chinese workers are being exploited not by domestic capitalists but by the current violent aggressors. Therefore, after our country's sovereignty and territory have obtained complete independence, the welfare problems of workers can be easily solved. (2) During this period of full-scale resistance, labor compatriots should deeply understand the importance of labor-management coordination, work hard to increase production, promote economic construction, and strive for the enrichment and strength of material and financial resources as necessary resources for a long-term war of resistance.</p>
<p>（三）全國勞工同胞、應踴躍參加兵　　或游擊戰爭等、以抵抗强暴之侵略者、為爭取最後勝利而奮鬬、（四）全市勞工同胞、應集中意志與力量、切實奉行國民精神總動員綱領、並一致參加本市國民精神總動員協會之工界組織</p>
<p>(3) Labor compatriots throughout the country should actively participate in military service or guerrilla warfare to resist the violent aggressors and fight for final victory. (4) Labor compatriots throughout the city should concentrate their will and strength, earnestly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, and unanimously participate in the labor organization of the Municipal National Spiritual Mobilization Association.</p>
<p>電請國際予我協助</p>
<p>Telegraphing International Organizations for Assistance</p>
<p>英國國際紡織工人聯合會、法國國際工人聯合會。美國總工會·美國工業工人委員會·荷蘭國際運輸總工會·荷蘭國際工廠工人聯合會均鑒、今日全中國工友在抗戰建國過程之中、熱烈慶祝國際勞働節、旣深切關懷我全世界工友增進福利與改良待遇之實際狀况、復痛感我國當前强暴之侵略者、如不予以澈底打倒、中日兩國之勞苦大衆、均無獲得自由解放之一日、在我國後期抗戰急劇展開、欣逢國際勞働節之今日、本會等謹代表上海市一百萬工友、向貴會致最誠摯最迫切之呼籲、深望貴會聯合全世界之工友、對於遠東强暴之侵略者、一致予以迎頭痛擊、封鎖其經濟、斷絕其來往、茲請以最可能之人力物力與財力、協助我國抗戰建國之大業、我國最後勝利獲得之日、即中國工友以及全中國同胞自由解放之日、即日本勞工羣衆及全日本被軍閥壓迫蹂躪之勞苦大眾獲得自由解放之日、亦即世界正義人類和平獲得確切保障之日、本會等謹以至誠、祈求貴會至善之助力、上海各工人團體聯合會扣東印</p>
<p>To the British International Textile Workers' Federation, the French International Workers' Federation, the American Federation of Labor, the American Committee for Industrial Organization, the Dutch International Transport Workers' Federation, and the Dutch International Factory Workers' Federation: Today, all Chinese workers are enthusiastically celebrating International Labor Day in the process of resisting aggression and building the nation. We deeply care about the actual situation of all workers around the world in improving their welfare and treatment. We also deeply feel that if the current violent aggressors in our country are not completely defeated, the working masses of both China and Japan will not have a day to gain freedom and liberation. As the later stage of China's war of resistance unfolds rapidly, and we joyfully celebrate International Labor Day, we, on behalf of one million workers in Shanghai, extend our most sincere and urgent appeal to your federation. We deeply hope that your federation will unite workers around the world to jointly strike a painful blow to the violent aggressors in the Far East, block their economy, and cut off their exchanges. We hereby request that you use all possible manpower, material resources, and financial resources to assist in China's great cause of resisting aggression and building the nation. The day when our country finally wins will be the day when Chinese workers and all Chinese compatriots are liberated, the day when the Japanese working masses and all the Japanese working masses oppressed and trampled on by warlords are liberated, and the day when world justice and human peace are surely guaranteed. We hereby sincerely pray for the best assistance from your federation. Shanghai Federation of Workers' Organizations, Dongyin Seal.</p>
<p>滬定航線恢復　　除裝貨外並載搭客　滬甬復航在請示中　哈納明日駛定海福四日啟椗</p>
<p>Shanghai-Dinghai Route Restored: In addition to loading cargo, passengers are also carried. Resumption of Shanghai-Ningbo Route is Under Request. The Hanna Sets Sail for Dinghai Tomorrow; the Haifu Sets Sail on the Fourth.</p>
<p>浙東通航口岸、如定海門寧波溫州等處、先後經華方軍事當局封鎖後、滬浙航運、即陷全部斷絕、各方以交通梗阻、影響滋鉅、故經分電請求復航、茲甬定綫首經批准、但因日艦扣留天　輪、致重吿停頓、滬定錢最近亦經允准復航、德商哈納輪、定明日直放定海、至滬甬綫則尙在候核中、各情如次·</p>
<p>After the ports of eastern Zhejiang, such as Dinghai, Ningbo, and Wenzhou, were successively blockaded by the Chinese military authorities, shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang was completely cut off. All parties believed that the traffic obstruction had a significant impact, so they sent separate telegrams requesting the resumption of navigation. Now, the Ningbo-Dinghai route was approved first, but because the Japanese warships detained the Tianlun, it was suspended again. The Shanghai-Dinghai route has also been recently approved for resumption. The German merchant ship Hanna is scheduled to sail directly to Dinghai tomorrow, while the Shanghai-Ningbo route is still awaiting approval. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>甬定綫復航未成</p>
<p>Ningbo-Dinghai Route Resumption Unsuccessful</p>
<p>自甬江於上月五日、經寗波防守司令部接奉蔣委員長電令、宣吿封鎖後、所有外輪、均一律禁阻出入、故原有行駛滬甬甬定之各錢輪隻、均吿停航、旋經定海商會等一再請求、始由第　集團軍司令部批准復航、並指定由德商天寳·高登，兩輪行駛、詎天寳輪於上月二十六日首决由甬開定時、竟在螺頭洋面、遭日艦扣留、挾迫駛滬、致該綫復航未成、重吿停頓、</p>
<p>Since the Yong River was announced to be blockaded on the 5th of last month after the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, all foreign ships were prohibited from entering and leaving. Therefore, all Qian ships originally operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Ningbo-Dinghai routes were suspended. Subsequently, after repeated requests from the Dinghai Chamber of Commerce, the Headquarters of the 　Army Group approved the resumption of navigation and designated the German merchant ships Tianbao and Gaodeng to operate. Unexpectedly, when the Tianbao ship first decided to sail from Ningbo to Dinghai on the 26th of last month, it was detained by Japanese warships in the Luotouyang waters and forced to sail to Shanghai, causing the route to fail to resume and be suspended again.</p>
<p>滬定綫明日恢復</p>
<p>Shanghai-Dinghai Route Restored Tomorrow</p>
<p>關於滬定航錢、經定海商會·定海旅滬同鄉會·及德商遠東公司·先後謂求恢復、以維航運後、業經浙省當局批准、公司方面、已接定分公司電吿如下、（上略）今奉劉總司令轉發政府復商會感電、海福哈納二專輪、准往來直航滬定、（下略）遠東公司接電後、決派哈納輪開航、定明日（即　日）下午四時、直放定海、該輪除裝貨外、並載搭客、票價（統艙）六元、（房艙）十二元、（官艙）十四元、並悉德商禮和洋行之海福輪、亦定本月四日、開定海、</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai-Dinghai route, after the Dinghai Chamber of Commerce, the Dinghai Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association, and the German merchant Far East Company successively requested the resumption of navigation to maintain shipping, it was approved by the Zhejiang Provincial authorities. The company has received the following telegram from the branch office: (omitted above) Now, Commander-in-Chief Liu has forwarded the government's telegram to the Chamber of Commerce, approving the Haifu and Hanna two special ships to travel back and forth directly to Shanghai and Dinghai. (omitted below) After receiving the telegram, the Far East Company decided to send the Hanna ship to sail, scheduled to depart directly for Dinghai tomorrow (i.e., the 　day) at 4:00 PM. In addition to loading cargo, the ship will also carry passengers. The ticket price is six yuan (steerage), twelve yuan (cabin), and fourteen yuan (officer's cabin). It is also learned that the Haifu ship of the German merchant Lihe Foreign Company is also scheduled to sail to Dinghai on the fourth of this month.</p>
<p>滬甬綫在請示中</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Route is Under Request</p>
<p>滬甬綫自斷航迄今、為期已將一月、除恩德輪經特准駛甬一决外、其他外輪、均遭禁阻、旅滬甬人、深以交通梗阻為苦、故曾由寗波旅滬同鄕會、及奪波商會、分電顧司令長官。第　集團軍總司令部。寗波防守司令部要求准予通融、的派輪隻、恢復航行、但該項請求、迄今尙未接奉批復、據悉該案業經轉呈最高軍事當局核示</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo route has been interrupted for a month. Except for the Ende ship, which was specially approved to sail to Ningbo once, other foreign ships have been prohibited. People from Ningbo in Shanghai have suffered greatly from the traffic obstruction. Therefore, the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association and the Duobo Chamber of Commerce sent separate telegrams to Commander Gu, the Headquarters of the 　Army Group, and the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters requesting permission to be accommodating and dispatch ships to resume navigation. However, the request has not yet been approved. It is reported that the case has been forwarded to the highest military authorities for review.</p>
<p>溫州綫尚難復航</p>
<p>Wenzhou Route is Still Difficult to Restore</p>
<p>浙東之通航口岸、原為海門溫州寗波三處、今因防務關係、暫禁通航、上次由滬駛溫中途折回之各輸、如意商中意公司德平、德商禮和洋行海福、德商遠東公司哈納、除哈納因將復航滬定綫巳卸貨外、其餘各輪、仍未卸貨、希望於短期時復航滬溫綫、但溫州因軍事緊張、暫時恐無恢復航行之希望、至於萬國航務公司之明和輪、本擬由溫裝載海關人員駛滬、今因葡輪關係、深恐為日扣留、故迄未由溫起椗</p>
<p>The navigable ports in eastern Zhejiang were originally Haimen, Wenzhou, and Ningbo. Now, due to defense reasons, navigation is temporarily prohibited. The ships that sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou and turned back halfway, such as Deping of the Italian merchant Zhongyi Company, Haifu of the German merchant Lihe Foreign Company, and Hanna of the German merchant Far East Company, have not yet unloaded their cargo, except for Hanna, which has unloaded its cargo because it is about to resume the Shanghai-Dinghai route. It is hoped that the Shanghai-Wenzhou route will be restored in the short term, but due to military tension in Wenzhou, there is no hope of resuming navigation temporarily. As for the Minghe ship of the International Shipping Company, it was originally intended to load customs personnel in Wenzhou and sail to Shanghai, but due to the relationship of the Portuguese ship, it is feared that it will be detained by Japan, so it has not yet set sail from Wenzhou.</p>

<p>Economic Special Edition, Second Symposium Record of This Journal: The Problem of Balancing Prices (Continued) Date: April 16th, 10:00 AM Location: 5th Floor Conference Hall, This Newspaper Written Opinions (In order of receipt)</p>
<p>Zhu Boquan: It is unavoidable that wartime prices are high. All countries experienced this during the European War, so high wartime prices in China are not surprising. Currently, prices of goods vary from place to place within the country, and the reasons for their high prices are not uniform. Taking Shanghai as an example, general prices have risen across the board, especially for essential goods. The main reason seems to be the imbalance of supply and demand. The Shanghai concession is isolated within the occupied area, and the source of goods is blocked. At the same time, factories in the eastern district have been destroyed and looted, and production has ceased, all of which have reduced the supply of goods. On the demand side, the population is dense, and consumption has greatly increased. Demand exceeds supply, and prices are bound to rise. Secondly, the increase in freight and insurance costs and other additional expenses, the decline in exchange rates, and the hoarding by speculators all have a significant impact on rising prices. Among them, the hoarding by speculators is most worthy of our attention. These people are taking advantage of rising prices to manipulate the market and make huge profits. From personal observation, such speculative manipulation is rampant in Shanghai today, and it is necessary to conduct investigations and take preventive measures. The government should adopt policies on prices after examining the conditions in various places and the production and consumption of goods, and implement effective controls. At the same time, it should supplement with sound monetary and financial policies, at least to prevent price increases from exceeding what is reasonable. Special attention should be paid to the regulation of essential goods to avoid affecting social order and hindering the progress of the war.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated measures for assessing prices and cracking down on speculation during extraordinary times, and issued circulars to various places to organize price stabilization committees. The measures are very appropriate, and if they can be effectively implemented, they will be effective. However, there are no accurate statistics on prices in various parts of our country, and there is a lack of detailed investigation of local products. There is also a great lack of talent with knowledge of price statistics. It seems appropriate for the government to set up a training class to recruit students and provide them with knowledge of statistical prices in a short period of time, and send them to various places to assist local authorities in handling investigation and statistical matters, so as to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>How to promote civil autonomous price controls (specifically referring to Shanghai) - The price control measures promulgated by the government are difficult to fully implement in Shanghai at present, and can only be handled automatically by civil autonomous organizations. I believe that on the one hand, a price stabilization committee should be organized by the municipal chamber of commerce and other organizations, bringing together talent with knowledge of price statistics, as well as representatives from various trade associations and other relevant parties, as the central figures of this committee, responsible for overall design and supervision and guidance. At the same time, each trade association should be responsible for organizing price stabilization sub-committees to handle price balance matters related to their respective industries. The first step should be to start with investigations, such as investigating how much inventory of a certain commodity is stored in various warehouses and stores, and how much the Shanghai population consumes of that commodity. Other details such as the source and cost of goods should also be investigated in detail. On the one hand, it is possible to detect whether there is hoarding and speculation, in order to prevent it. At the same time, it is also possible to assess the standard of prices, so that the industry can supervise each other. On the other hand, the financial industry should also pay special attention to commodity mortgages. The banking industry association should stipulate that when the banking industry undertakes commodity mortgages, it should pay attention to whether the commodities are for normal commercial use, or whether they are speculative hoarding. The latter should be refused loans uniformly. Furthermore, a distinction should be made between essential and non-essential goods. The former can be adjusted more, while the latter should be tightened. In addition, for goods lacking in Shanghai that need to be obtained from the interior and are not related to military needs, their import should be encouraged. The above are just a few points from the financial industry. If all parties can work together, price stability will not be difficult.</p>
<p>Price control policies in various countries - European and American countries are all industrial countries, and their production is concentrated in the hands of a few large capitalists. During wartime, various production and transportation industries are managed by the state, and price controls are easier to implement. Our country is an agricultural country, and its political and economic conditions are different from those of European and American countries. Moreover, our country has never had accurate statistics and investigations on prices and production and consumption quantities. Methods that are effective in those countries seem difficult to apply in China.</p>
<p>Yao Qingsan: Currently, domestic prices are much higher than before the war, but the situation varies from place to place. The cost of living index in Shanghai is about 50% higher than before the war, while the rise is even more dramatic in the southwest. As for the reasons, they are extremely complex. Generally speaking, they can be divided into currency-related reasons and non-currency-related reasons. First, regarding currency-related reasons, the most important is the fall in the exchange rate of legal tender, which has caused the prices of foreign goods to increase sharply, and the prices of domestic goods that use foreign goods as raw materials or compete with foreign goods have also increased accordingly. This reason applies to both Shanghai and the southwest. As for currency-related reasons that only apply to the southwest, there are also two points. One is the extraordinary cost of Shanghai remittances. Recently, remittances from the southwest to Shanghai have cost between 100 and 200 yuan. In other words, paying 1,100 to 1,200 yuan in the southwest only yields 1,000 yuan in Shanghai. Goods shipped from Shanghai to the southwest naturally need to increase in price. This is one reason for the drastic price increases in the southwest. The second is the increase in legal tender. Since the outbreak of the war, the government has been cautious about the issuance of legal tender, but in the southwest, there is still a trend of increasing the issuance of legal tender, which is also an undeniable fact. This is also a reason for the relatively drastic price increases in the southwest. Now, let's talk about non-currency-related reasons. First, there is a decrease in supply. Since the outbreak of the war, many important commodity production areas or factories have been occupied, and production decreases are inevitable. In addition, various parties have implemented controls, resulting in a relative decrease in commodity supply, and prices are bound to rise. Second, there is an extraordinary increase in transportation costs. Since the outbreak of the war, transportation has been blocked in various places, making it difficult to communicate. Even if there are transportation routes, transportation costs are bound to be extraordinarily high. Since the cost of goods has increased, prices are bound to rise. Third, since the outbreak of the war, the population of Shanghai and the southwest has increased sharply, which has increased the demand for goods and caused prices to rise. Fourth, currently, merchants face many dangers when transporting goods, so they must raise prices after arriving at their destination to compensate for the risks they have taken. Therefore, a part of the price of goods actually contains the nature of insurance premiums. Fifth, the hoarding and speculation by merchants is naturally an unavoidable phenomenon.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou: Although price fluctuations are due to many factors, in my opinion, the state of people's minds is also a major factor. It is not scarcity but inequality that is the problem. If things can be distributed equally, prices can be stabilized. For example, with rice, if people believe that there will be a shortage, those with money will store more. As rumors spread, people compete to hoard, and those who hoard rice engage in even more speculation. Therefore, even if there is an official price, there is still an unofficial price. For example, if people believe that the currency is inflating, everyone competes to buy, and prices naturally rise.</p>
<p>To balance prices, we must first stabilize people's minds. Local authorities and community leaders should cooperate in regulating the supply of goods, but news should not be deliberately sensationalized to be exploited by speculators. If this is done, the third and fourth points in the discussion can be resolved, and there will be no unnecessary problems. In short, control is not a bad method, but control that violates natural regulation will result in greater harm than not controlling at all. Therefore, I believe that the government should only adopt policies that remove the causes of price increases or decreases, and play an auxiliary role, while taking autonomous price controls as the main initiative. It is absolutely not appropriate to use rigid methods that will only make the people uneasy. I have other important business and cannot attend the meeting in person. I hope you will understand.</p>
<p>Xie Juxue: (1) Increased currency circulation - Regardless of whether it is convertible or non-convertible, excessive or non-excessive issuance, it is sufficient to promote price increases. For example, during the European War, the paper money issued by the United States had full gold reserves, but prices rose as much as in England and France. This is because more chips are enough to cause the purchasing power of money to fall.</p>
<p>(2) Increased costs - For example, raw materials are provided for military use, and supply is scarce. Or laborers and farmers join the army, and there is a lack of manpower, which are all reasons for increased production costs. Other factors such as difficult transportation, high water freight, increased insurance premiums and taxes, and changes in exchange rates are all reasons for increased transportation costs.</p>
<p>(3) Imbalance of supply and demand - On the supply side, traffic is interrupted, production stops or decreases, or is controlled by the government or occupied by the enemy, resulting in a shortage of inventory. On the demand side, consumer demand and speculative demand come one after another, supply and demand are unbalanced, and prices become even more expensive.</p>
<p>The reasons for high prices in Shanghai are also due to the above reasons. However, if certain major items have never been hoarded, the prices should not be so high. The fact that the major warehouses and godowns in this city are not piled up with goods means that the argument that the supply is scarce cannot be established. The central bank and other institutions are extremely cautious in issuing currency, and legal tender in the occupied area is only being actively contracted, never increased. The fact that the discount on legal tender in this city is often around 50 yuan proves that the amount of currency in circulation is not very loose. The argument of currency inflation cannot be established.</p>
<p>The easiest way to balance prices is for local financiers to cooperate and adopt a serious attitude of vigilance towards commodity mortgages (excluding export goods), especially for general goods that are essential to the lives of civilians. Those who engage in hoarding, except for a few wealthy and powerful individuals, mostly buy large quantities of goods and borrow huge sums of money from the financial industry. The channels for using funds are very narrow, and commodity mortgages are naturally welcome. The situation is the same as with mortgaged real estate before January 28th. As a result, the trend of hoarding goods is encouraged, and the rise in prices cannot be stopped. Now, we believe that the financial industry can agree to increase the discount on mortgaged goods, or use the prices before the war as a benchmark. At the same time, the guild, the reserve, and the discount committee should jointly determine the standard to restrict the industry's "accommodation of officials and restoration of customers." If this is done, those who hoard goods will inevitably be cautious, and prices can tend to balance. We still remember that in the spring of 1937, when prices in the United States soared, the US authorities reduced the mortgaged price of American cotton, and the rising trend was stopped. Looking at the firm and weak market of public bonds in the past, it is determined by the discount of bank mortgages. Therefore, it is not difficult to foresee that this move will have a significant effect. Moreover, this move is not only a moral responsibility that the financial industry should fulfill, but also an essential plan to protect its own business. The current price increase is too large, and the danger is very serious. If there is a misstep, it will inevitably suffer a major loss. The silk mortgage ten years ago and the real estate mortgage before January 28th are all lessons from the past.</p>
<p>Civil autonomous price controls, such as rice, often see public organizations come forward to organize price stabilization committees to find ways to balance prices whenever prices are high, which is quite effective. The fact that the price of rice in Shanghai today is not rising as wildly as other goods should be attributed to this organization. If it can be extended to other goods, it will be of great benefit to the livelihoods of civilians. However, hoarding rice has always been prohibited and is not easy to store for a long time, so balancing is easier. The autonomous control of other commodity prices must be based on the position of the entire industry, benefiting the country and the people. Under the guidance of the trade association, they should actively participate in order to be effective.</p>
<p>Liu Sun: The reasons for high wartime prices: (1) Natural transportation difficulties, and imbalances in supply and demand; (2) Man-made, hoarding and speculation, and manipulating market prices. Now, let's compare the retail prices of rice, coal briquettes, and white cotton cloth in various places, taking December of last year as 100, and compare them with January of this year. The changes are as follows: Medium rice Chongqing fell 10.7, Wanxian rose 35.8, Chengdu rose 9.1, Nanzheng rose 13.8, Guilin fell 17.7, Kunming rose 22.3, Fuzhou fell 9.9, Shanghai fell 2.6: Coal briquettes Chongqing fell 10.0, Wanxian had no increase or decrease, Chengdu fell 33.3, Fuzhou rose 2.1, Shanghai had no increase or decrease, Nanzheng, Guilin, and Kunming had no coal briquettes. Charcoal fell 6.0 in Nanzheng, rose 7.0 in Kunming, but rose as much as 78.7 in Guilin. White cotton cloth Wanxian, Nanzheng, and Fuzhou had no increase or decrease. Kunming, Chongqing, and Chengdu each rose 2.7 to 25.0, but Guilin rose sharply by as much as 75.0. The above is just a brief overview of the general situation of clothing, food, and fuel in various places.</p>
<p>The government should adopt policies on prices</p>
<p>I believe that this issue should be discussed in two parts: (1) Unnecessary items such as luxury goods can be left unrestricted and allowed to rise in price, because these items are only used by a small number of the bourgeoisie and are not related to the national economy and the people's livelihood; however, (2) for the necessities of life that are related to the majority of the people, we must plan well-thought-out policies, such as increasing production, facilitating transportation, and compiling price lists. However, this must be handled by honest civil servants in order to be effective. Otherwise, if handled improperly, it will become government manipulation, and the impact on the people will be even greater than when merchants manipulate it. It is best for the government to strengthen the organization of trade associations and supervise their implementation, which is better than pure government management.</p>
<p>How to promote civil autonomous price controls</p>
<p>I believe that the most important thing is to implement agreements or substitute other items when a certain item rises in price, so that it can be automatically adjusted due to supply and demand.</p>
<p>Introduction to price control policies in various countries During the European War, Russia had organizations such as the "National Food Supply Special Committee," the "Central Flour Administration," the "Central Food Administration," and the "Salt Management Committee." The "National Food Supply Special Committee" also set a "Fixed Price," publishing a list of the prices of several commodities in advance. Later, when the government purchased them, it collected them at the listed price; general transactions also consistently purchased at this price. Another type was the "Regulated Price," which was the selling price forcibly set by local governments. Anyone who did not sell at the "Regulated Price" would be punished by the government. Russia's implementation of these two methods was the initial step in commercial nationalization. In the initial implementation, there were also various difficulties, and it underwent several reforms before it achieved its effect. Other countries also have their own methods of controlling prices, but the situation in our country is different from that in European and American countries, and it seems that we cannot completely imitate the old methods.</p>
<p>Pan Hengqin: (1) Not due to currency inflation (for reasons, please see page 3 of the 47th issue of the Banking Weekly) (2) Due to the huge military needs during the war, the demand for necessities has increased (3) Unscrupulous merchants hoard and speculate to monopolize the market (4) Cultivated land is regarded as a war zone, and factories are destroyed by the enemy, so production cannot proceed (5) Insurance premiums are increased, interest rates are raised, and production costs are increased (6) The Japanese impose heavy taxes, which increase costs (7) Transportation is interrupted and transportation is inconvenient (8) Due to the black market for foreign exchange, the prices of imported goods have risen, which in turn has led to the rise in the prices of domestic goods (9) Consumption has increased, and the population of Shanghai has increased sharply from 3 million to 5 million (according to recent newspaper statistics on the population) (10) The financial industry is competing to make commodity mortgages</p>
<p>The government should adopt policies on prices</p>
<p>(1) A price control committee should be established to coordinate all plans (2) Officially set prices (3) Fixed quota allocation (4) Control consumption (5) Facilitate transportation Please see page 10 of the 12th issue of Selected Economic Essays from China and Foreign Countries (6) In principle, it is best to abolish the black market for foreign exchange, but it is not easy to do so. The authorities should provide as much foreign exchange as possible for the import of necessities, so the current technology for approving foreign exchange should be reformed so that the import of genuine necessities can obtain foreign exchange.</p>
<p>How to promote civil autonomous price controls</p>
<p>(1) Widely publicize the importance of price controls, which is the responsibility of the publishing industry (2) Use commercial organizations such as trade associations as the main force for civil price controls. If trade associations can be responsible for handling it, the effect will be significant. (3) Trade associations should crack down on merchants who hoard and speculate (4) Thrift campaigns are the best way to promote civil autonomous price controls (5) The government should work with banks to adjust prices with financial power, such as the government stipulating the highest interest rate for tea mortgages.</p>
<p>Symposium Record Two</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan: Summarizing the reasons given by the gentlemen for soaring prices and the different degrees of price increases for various goods: we can reach a conclusion:</p>
<p>(1) The main reason for the current price increase is not so much due to currency factors as it is due to the imbalance of supply and demand. The relationship between the fall in exchange rates and the direct rise in prices should have stopped long ago. But in fact, there is still a continuing upward trend. It can be seen that in addition to exchange rates, there are other reasons, and that reason is that the supply and demand relationship has not improved.</p>
<p>(2) The main reasons for the imbalance of supply and demand: lie in the fact that most of China's industrial areas have been lost, and production has naturally been greatly affected. The war zone is vast, and the freight relations within the war zone are subject to various obstacles from the Japanese and puppets, as well as harsh levies and taxes. Between the war zone and the non-war zone, in addition to the obstacles to freight from the Japanese and puppets, there are also controls on import and export transit trade by the central government, and controls on domestic and foreign exchange, all of which make the free flow of goods intermittent. The high cost of freight, insurance, and exchange rates means that if prices in the consumer area do not rise sharply, producers will not be willing to go there. Therefore, as long as goods are in circulation, they take as a prerequisite that the price in the consumer area is more expensive than the price in the production area, to the extent that they can make a fortune from the national crisis. This creates price differences in space. In addition to the objective conditions of the environment, this difference obviously contains the moral conditions of speculation and manipulation of hoarding and high prices.</p>
<p>(3) The prices of handicrafts and mineral products have risen the most, the prices of agricultural raw materials have risen less, and the prices of agricultural products in rural areas have even fallen generally, while the prices of goods in urban areas have risen generally. The prices of imported goods have risen uniformly, and the prices of local products have risen and fallen to varying degrees. This is all due to the relationship between currency and supply and demand and the situation formed by their weaving. However, the impact of currency is limited to the black market impact of exchange rates, rather than the increase in the number of currency in circulation. Imported goods are affected by the rise in exchange rates, and the rise in the prices of imported goods also affects the prices of some local products and causes them to rise. The prices of local products that are not related to imported goods vary greatly in space due to changes in freight relations and supply and demand. This difference in space can also affect each other and move towards a consistent rising process. For example, Shanghai, the cotton yarn producing area, has risen due to a decrease in production: but because the interior needs are urgent, it is sold at a high price. Merchants sell it to the interior, adding transportation costs and other costs, and normal profits, and also use the degree of local needs to add illegitimate profits, which is the speculative price benefit. Therefore, the selling price in the interior is even more expensive, and this more expensive price affects Shanghai, the producing area, and Shanghai yarn merchants use this as a standard for high prices. In this way, mutually causing and effecting, prices continue to soar until natural savings occur.</p>
<p>(4) But the savings of necessities of life have a certain limit. Therefore, the price increase of such goods is not easy to stop. If a halt occurs, the oppression suffered by the national life can be said to have reached the highest degree. Whether from the producer's point of view or from the consumer's point of view: it is unfavorable. The consumer's disadvantage is the most obvious. The producer's disadvantage to high prices is not understood by the general public. Therefore, high-price periods are often regarded as boom periods. But the reason for the current high prices is due to the increase in secondary costs, and these costs occur in the circulation process, such as freight, insurance, and exchange rates, with the harsh levies and taxes of the Japanese and puppets being the greatest. This kind of exorbitant tax is regarded as one of the costs by merchants, but it is obtained without labor by the Japanese and puppets. If the price increase in Shanghai has a certain degree, then this unearned extortion will also have to have a certain limit. But Shanghai is a free market, and prices can soar arbitrarily, so this unearned extortion can also be demanded arbitrarily. Therefore, to maintain the free market of Shanghai prices, the profitable producers can rather be said to be the Japanese and puppets and foreign merchants. And the production costs of foreign merchants are fundamentally expensive, and the impact of exchange rates is deep, so the possibility of profit is far less than that of Japanese merchants. What's more, the markets in the war zone are all controlled by the Japanese army, and there is no freedom to enter and exit. Therefore, no matter from the producer's point of view, the consumer's point of view, or even the foreign merchant's point of view, they should all take a long-term view and jointly balance the current rising prices to a reasonable standard.</p>
<p>Shen Zhenyi: To stabilize prices, in my opinion, we must first distinguish the types of goods and make the following three observations: (1) export commodities, (2) luxury goods, (3) daily necessities. Regarding the first item, because the price increase is beneficial, there is no need to stabilize it. The second item is only for the enjoyment of a few people and has little to do with the general public, so it can be allowed to rise naturally. Only the third item, daily necessities, in the current situation, it is really necessary to find ways to stabilize it. Indeed, in the current special environment, any good method is not easy to obtain satisfactory results. However, if we can do our best and do what we can, and if the trade associations come out to maintain it with the greatest strength, it is not impossible to do so. For example, the price of rice, in today's soaring prices, can still stand at the limit price of 14 yuan, which is lower than the general price increase after the war. This cannot but be attributed to the rice industry association. Furthermore, the degree of increase in silk fabrics after the war is not as high as that of raw silk. According to the recent price of silk, it has risen by 161% compared to before the war, while silk fabrics have only risen by 47% to 26%. Although there is no doubt that the cost has been reduced due to the interweaving of raw silk and rayon, it is said that the trade association has also discussed and formulated regulations to stabilize prices, and does not want to rise and fall as wildly as the price of silk. As for the soaring prices of vegetable oil and soybean oil today, although they are due to another special problem, it seems difficult to stabilize them for a while, but if the industry proceeds in a positive direction, it may not be possible to find ways to remedy them. Judging from the increase in soybeans and soybean oil, the recent price of oil has risen by 71% compared to two months ago, while the price of soybeans in the same period has risen by 15%, which is a huge difference. At this time when the price of oil is high and the raw materials are very high, the oil workshops in the rural areas that use local methods to extract oil will definitely be happy to increase production because of the high profits. If the source can be unblocked, the current price of oil can also be stabilized. On the one hand, more small-scale oil mills can be set up in this city to purchase soybeans from the interior to make oil, which is a fundamental plan. In view of this, if the trade associations follow the spirit of civil autonomous price stabilization and engage in unblocking sources, increasing production, or using other substitutes to suppress the soaring prices of certain goods due to shortages, then even in extremely difficult circumstances, at least the effect of stabilizing a part of the prices can be achieved. I hope to give strength to the discussion community and enlighten everything. I think all industries will not let the rice and silk industries monopolize the beauty of the past. (To be continued) Mailbox What if war breaks out in Europe</p>
<p>Letter from Mr. Ni Yafei (omitted above) The European situation is becoming increasingly serious, and war seems inevitable: Although our country is located in East Asia, the world situation is closely related; when a vortex arises, it is not without impact. Here are a few questions for your enlightenment:</p>
<p>(A) If war breaks out in Europe, then</p>
<p>(1) What impact will it have on China's national economy during the Anti-Japanese War?</p>
<p>(2) Will China's foreign exchange reserves suffer any disadvantages?</p>
<p>(3) Will there be any changes in the relationship between China's legal tender and the shilling?</p>
<p>(4) Will foreign capital come to our country to avoid war?</p>
<p>(5) Will the value of foreign currency in our country's market depreciate or vice versa?</p>
<p>(6) Will China's foreign trade and import industries be completely paralyzed? Especially the import of our military needs?</p>
<p>(B) Will the general cost of living index in Shanghai increase even more? Or will it fall rapidly?</p>
<p>The reporter replies As of now: The nature of the future European war has not yet been determined: Is it an imperialist war? Or an anti-aggression war? This will be determined by whether the Soviet Union and the United States participate. These two different natures will also have different impacts on China's economy and the entire world economy. Politics and economy are interconnected, so are they in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. Therefore, the above questions must also be dealt with separately according to the nature of the war. And we must pay attention to the comparison with the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>If the war is for the purpose of anti-aggression with the participation of the Soviet Union and the United States, then the environment in which our country finds itself may have three different changes: One is that due to pressure from other parties on the Japanese side, we will launch a general counter-offensive, and an opportunity for an absolute and advantageous general counter-offensive. Therefore, the driving force for wartime economic construction will rapidly expand from the interior to the areas that have been overcome. This improvement in the military situation makes it very possible for foreign capital to come to China to avoid war. Unless the warring countries immediately and strictly manage their capital markets to make this impossible. But at that time, it will inevitably enter the stage of genuine money (including financial aid and investment) and effort (including joining the army and labor service) due to the upswing of the national spirit. The development of the national economy will be far more rapid and reasonable than during the previous European war. The second is the possibility that the Japanese side will sell out its allies and use the resources in the Chinese war zone as bait to lure the British and Americans. Whether the British and Americans are willing to be deceived will be determined by the results of the Soviet Union's operations in Europe. However, China will definitely not be willing to be sold out by the British and Americans, so it will continue to resist Japan. For the sake of the future fate of British and American rights and interests in China, even if they compromise with Japan, they will not change the feelings and assistance to China's war of resistance against Japan. Therefore, China's situation may be even more difficult than it is today, but all the economic conditions required for the war will not be interrupted. If the British and Americans are deceived by the Japanese side, and our country is deceived by the British and Americans, then economic activities within China will inevitably accelerate under the control of the Japanese side. As a result, the colonial economic process will be completed. Not only will there be no welfare and effects of the national economy, but the wealth and sweat of the entire Chinese people will be squeezed dry. But this possibility is extremely weak, at least it will not easily happen until the end of the European war. Third: Japan may intensify its military operations against China. In addition to relying on the geographical situation to hold on, China will also expand guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas. This situation may occur immediately before or after the outbreak of the European war, or it may occur after a considerable period of time, or it may continue and unfold a long-term war, or it may unfold intermittently. Japan must mainly focus on a quick victory, and if it fails, it may turn to a war of attrition in order to carry out its leisure to alienate the anti-aggression front. Whether our country will still adopt a war of attrition is not necessarily certain. But if the anti-aggression front adheres to its faith, then the Japanese side's military operations will inevitably promote its early collapse. However, the fate of the Chinese economy is more difficult to judge. However, Japan's planned exploitation of the economy in the war zone will still be nothing more than intensifying its plunder, but its financial difficulties and its domestic currency crisis will be more severe than they are today. Because his financial groups will not dare to risk investing in China, and the development of his inflation will inevitably unfold more badly, and the result will only accelerate the collapse of his national strength.</p>
<p>As for our country's foreign exchange reserves, what is the point of being unfavorable at that time? It is the same now. Because there is no need for our country to recover them at all, and they are not deposited in one country. And its contribution to the Anti-Japanese War is not so much in protecting the legal tender as it is in emphasizing financial credit abroad. In addition to the physical basis, the credit of a country's finances also has a political basis. Referring to the previous section, it can be known that there is no problem.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, if the British government does not take emergency measures, the pound will inevitably fluctuate temporarily. But according to the experience of 1914, it can generally maintain its stability. Today, the British pound's defense mechanism is extremely complete, and the technology of modern exchange control is much more perfect than before. In fact, if the United States immediately participates in the war, then the international financial market will not be swept up by the war. As for the status of our country's legal tender, in fact, everything has long been manipulated by its political status. So the problem is not the outbreak of the European war, but what kind of environment our country will be in after the outbreak of the European war? This can be reviewed with the above three changes. And there is more possibility of being firm due to the upswing of the national spirit. For example, the recent sharp rise in the value of legal tender in North China and the sharp drop in Japanese puppet vouchers have been affected by the new diplomatic posture between the United States and Japan and the fact that the Soviet-British negotiations have raised the issue of Japan.</p>
<p>The fourth item of question A has been explained in the previous section. The fifth item is fundamentally unfounded. Because no country has any need to adopt a policy of depreciating its currency during wartime. As for the changes in its market price, it can also be inferred from the explanation in the previous section.</p>
<p>No country today can be said to have completely self-sufficient conditions, and the United States and the Soviet Union are not omnipotent either: not to mention the others. Therefore, if they do not have exports, they are not worried about not being able to import: Therefore, as long as our country continues to export, it is not worried about not being able to import. If the first possibility mentioned above becomes a reality, then our country's exports will definitely increase more than they do today, so there is a possibility of increasing imports. Since China is an anti-aggression war country, it is not worried about the supply and assistance of military supplies to us by friendly countries. Moreover, the necessary degree of military supplies imports: also depends on the storage capacity: the development of the war situation and the acquisition of war trophies; the relationship with the other party and other situations. Therefore, although we cannot speculate recklessly, we do not have to worry unnecessarily.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union and the United States remain neutral and still launch a war to seize colonies for imperialism, then our country's economic environment at that time will not change much from today. As for question B, it also varies with changes in the political environment. But one thing that can be predicted is that the population will inevitably decrease compared to today. Therefore, if there is no bad destruction in terms of currency and the current situation can be maintained, then although imports may be slightly reduced, the price aspect will not change much. Commercial News Finance Cash is not being made The price of British Indian silver is falling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot black market in this city was closed due to a weekly holiday, so the price was never shouted. According to inquiries from the cash exchange department, the price was still around the last transaction price before. 2,078 yuan was sold, and 75 yuan was received. The receipts and payments were also scarce.</p>
<p>The price of gold jewelry per tael in the silver building industry is still flat. Datongxing is listed at 211 yuan, and Xintongxing is listed at 209 yuan. The receipts are both about 203 yuan.

The price of counterfeit money plummeted and was difficult to control. It is said that it has been halved.</p>
<p>Last week, because the Chinese army won victories in various battlefields and the good news spread throughout the country, the people were increasingly unwilling to accept the paper money of the puppet "Joint Reserve Bank" of Tianjin. When the black market opened on Monday last week, compared with Saturday of the previous week, it was reduced by 4 yuan 2 jiao and 5 fen per hundred yuan. 100 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 121 yuan 5 jiao of "counterfeit money." There was no change on Tuesday. It continued to fall by 4 yuan on Wednesday, and the price was 125 yuan 5 jiao. It fell sharply by 5 yuan again on Thursday, and the price was 130 yuan and 5 jiao. When it opened on Friday morning, it fell again by 1 yuan and 5 jiao, and the price was 132 yuan. Then I heard that the Chinese army surrounded Nanchang, and there was news that the "Joint Reserve Bank" was also shaken. The price of "counterfeit money" continued to fall sharply. At the same time, the price of gold in Tianjin rose to a high price of about 250 yuan per tael, and it was immediately (28th) temporarily suspended for several days, and then the method was determined. In addition, prices soared, and the price of each bag of rice exceeded</p>
<h3>MIN AND GUANGDONG SEAS: JAPANESE WARSHIPS REPEATEDLY INTERCEPT FOREIGN VESSELS</h3>
<p>THE "WEST SIGHS" CARGO IS NOW IN TAIWAN; THE "NEW HAIMEN" IS FORTUNATE TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE FROM BRITISH WARSHIPS</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, April 8th: The British company Jardine Matheson's vessel "West Sighs" was loading salt in Dongshan Quan Bay on the Fujian border when it was seized by a Japanese warship and taken to Penghu. Many salt-carrying wooden boats were also burned. Passengers and crew members from the "West Sighs" were taken to Taiwan. Upon hearing the news, a British warship rushed to negotiate, but without success. Since then, all those taking foreign vessels have been very cautious. More than 120 passengers on the "West Sighs" were severely mistreated and interrogated in Taipei. It was not until the 24th that they were escorted back to Hong Kong on the "Guangdong Maru". It is said that some people, identified as artillerymen, were not released. The cargo of the "West Sighs" was seized in Taiwan and is about to become a pending case. Furthermore, on the 22nd, the British vessel "New Haimen" and the Norwegian merchant vessel "Gungsholm" were also intercepted by Japanese warships en route. The "Gungsholm", carrying tens of thousands of dan of beans, paper, and bamboo shoots from Fuzhou, encountered three Japanese warships suddenly in the White Dog Sea area on its way to Shantou. It was ordered to stop, and then Japanese soldiers were sent from the Japanese warships to thoroughly inspect the cargo manifest. After reviewing it, the ship was immediately seized and taken to Taiwan. The "New Haimen", sailing from Fuzhou to Shantou, saw the "Gungsholm" being seized by the Japanese warship and immediately telegraphed for assistance. A small British warship near Quanzhou heard the news and rushed to the Shitou Dog Sea area. However, because of its small size, it appeared insignificant compared to the Japanese warships. Fearing a collision, armed sailors were sent to move the large and small cannons and anti-aircraft guns onto the "New Haimen" for armed self-defense. The three Japanese warships formed a triangular formation, aiming their cannons at the "New Haimen", firmly refusing to let it pass. They also sent airplanes to circle above the British vessel. The ship's anti-aircraft guns were aimed at the Japanese planes, preventing them from flying too low. Just as the situation was extremely tense, a large British warship arrived. Before it arrived, a squadron of fighter planes flew in to protect it. Seeing the situation was not favorable, the Japanese warships immediately retreated. The "New Haimen" has been operating between Shantou, Hong Kong, and Fuzhou for more than ten years and is in the same company as the "West Sighs". The Japanese navy's desire to monopolize coastal and river shipping rights is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<h3>COASTAL COUNTIES OF FUJIAN PROVINCE: POPULATION AND MATERIALS EVACUATED</h3>
<p>Xianyou and Hui'an Counties Already Implementing</p>

(7) The Lianbao office in the area through which the evacuation passes will be responsible for deploying sentries for protection. All civilian-owned guns should be taken out and distributed to able-bodied men for use. The evacuation measures for Hui'an County include: (1) All goods that can be used by the enemy should be evacuated, with every ten merchants forming a unit to transport them to government-designated locations. (2) Evacuated goods can be divided into two categories: the first category is timber, copper, and iron, which the chamber of commerce or district office will notify each merchant to transport within ten days; the second category is grain and daily necessities, of which a portion should be reserved for five days of market sales, and the remainder should be transported. (After five days of sales, the chamber of commerce or district office should be notified to transport them to the collection point.) (3) The chamber of commerce or district office should issue transportation permits for evacuated goods, and the district office or police station will be responsible for supervision. (4) The local baojia leader will be responsible for protecting the storage location of the goods. If theft occurs, the baojia leader will be held accountable.

<h3>NATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITIES DECIDE ON WARTIME EDUCATION POLICIES</h3>
<p>Education Conference Proposals Include Three Key Points: Uphold Educational Freedom, Build China</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The National Christian University Education Conference, which began on April 17th in Hong Kong and lasted for six days, has been reported in this newspaper. According to Miao Qiusheng, a pastor who attended the conference, the National Christian University Education Conference was originally held annually. After the conference in February 1937, this is the first conference held after the outbreak of the War of Resistance. The first expression of this conference is the spirit of unity, and the second is to exchange experiences gained during the War of Resistance and views on current issues. The thirteen Christian universities currently have 6,000 students, accounting for one-tenth of the number of students in public and private universities nationwide. The reason why universities have been able to maintain themselves after the outbreak of the war is entirely due to the deep understanding of righteousness, salary cuts, and hard work of the faculty and staff, as well as the huge special subsidies granted by friendly countries (about one million yuan last year). This conference lasted for six days and passed 33 proposals, all of which were adapted to the wartime Christian education policy during the national crisis.</p>
<p>Educational Policy During the National Crisis</p>
<p>The resolutions passed at this conference can be summarized into three key points: A. (1) Cultivate Christian character, (2) Education must be free, (3) Be loyal to the country. We would rather make the greatest sacrifices. These three principles are extremely important. The reason why universities have repeatedly moved is purely because education cannot be carried out in accordance with these principles. This is the first key point of the resolutions of this conference. B. Implement Christian higher education and build a new China. We should be prepared in advance for the important mission we bear to the country and the nation during and after the War of Resistance. Therefore, we hope that universities that cannot implement the above principles and have to move elsewhere should study the overall issues of the location in order to make a contribution to the local area, the country, and the people. We must not be perfunctory and live in peace, harbor the mentality of fleeing from disaster, and even more so, we should not hope to move back to the original school in the future. This is the second key point of the resolutions of this conference. C. Establish a Rural Construction Committee to concentrate the strength of various universities, implement concerted cooperation, and build rural China. In the past, the contributions of various universities to rural areas were inconsistent and the strength was dispersed. Each school spent one million yuan on agricultural science each year. In the future, in order to promote agricultural affairs, increase production, and build rural areas, it is impossible to succeed without a unified organization to coordinate all plans. Therefore, this association was formed. This is the third key point of the resolutions of this conference.</p>
<p>Overcoming Difficulties and Devoting Oneself to Education</p>
<p>Shi Long said that Christian undertakings in our country are divided into three categories: one is evangelism, the second is medicine, and the third is education. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance in our country, the first two tasks continued to be carried out within the possible scope in the occupied areas, adapting to the needs of the times and engaging in relief work with the greatest effort. As for education, there are only two options: one is to suspend operations, and the other is to continue operations. I have already mentioned that if education can be free and the lives of faculty, staff, and students can be guaranteed, no matter how difficult or how great the sacrifices, it will continue to be carried out. Before the War of Resistance, under this principle, eleven of the thirteen Christian universities continued to operate. For example, Huazhong University first moved from Wuchang to Guilin, then to Dali in Yunnan, and finally to western Sichuan. Soochow University was originally in Suzhou, then moved to Huzhou, then to Hangxi in Anhui, and finally to the Shanghai Concession, so the losses were heavy, but it is still proceeding in difficulties.</p>
<h3>THE BRITISH BOXER INDEMNITY FUND COMMITTEE'S STUDY ABROAD EXAM</h3>

<h3>BEIPING REPUBLIC COLLEGE MOVES TO XUPU</h3>
<p>(Xupu Correspondence) The private Beiping Republic College moved west to Xupu from Chayang after Yueyang was lost. There were more than 200 students in Changsha. After coming west, due to transportation obstacles, and also because the Department of Education ordered the suspension of new student enrollment in the education department, there are now more than 100 students. The school is actively carrying out the "implementation of the tutor system," "implementation of military management," and "improvement of academic research" for school socialization.</p>
<h3>MINISTRY OF EDUCATION'S MOBILE EDUCATION VEHICLE DEPARTS FOR GUIZHOU AND YUNNAN TO WORK</h3>

It has worked in Yibin, Rongwei, Leshan, Meishan, Chengdu, Jianyang, Lezhi, Suining, Tongliang, and Tongren counties, as well as various townships along the highway in these counties. Statistics in mid-March showed that the number of people educated was over 100,000. On April 5th, the vehicle went to Chongqing once, and now it has returned to Fengshan, turning to the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway to teach in various counties and townships along the highway in Guizhou Province.</p>
<h3>SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL COUNCIL PRIMARY SCHOOLS ACHIEVEMENT EXHIBITION YESTERDAY</h3>

<h3>FABER CUP MINIATURE FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT OPENS; EVERLAST LOSES TO LIDO</h3>
<p>Four to Two; Li Yichen Scores Three Goals; Wenying Defeats French Army Three to Zero</p>
<p>The Donghua Sports Association's Faber Cup miniature football league opened yesterday afternoon at the Sino-French College of Technology stadium on Avenue Albert. There were two demonstration matches. The official league will begin on Wednesday. In yesterday's first match between the French Army and Wenying, the playing was disorganized and unexciting. Wenying's Tao Ziming performed very well. Deng Zhiyang won with a shot. In the first half, Tao Tingfu kicked a ball into the net from the penalty spot, and Deng Zhiyang followed up with a shot to score. Wenying won 3-0.</p>
<p>Wenying: Tao Ziming, Wang Guowei, Shen Jinyuan, Zhang Yinhai, Zhao Yongfang, Deng Zhiyang, Tao Tingfu.</p>
<p>Lido Defeats Everlast</p>
<p>Everlast is the incarnation of Donghua, so the situation immediately became tense after Lido and Everlast entered the arena. Faber kicked off, and after two minutes of fierce fighting, Lido's Zhang Mingsheng launched the first attack, but the shot went out of bounds. Lido's three forwards were closely watched by Everlast and did nothing. Everlast also launched surprising attacks many times, but to no avail due to the iron legs and Meng Yang sitting in the town. The stalemate lasted until 20 minutes, when Zhang Mingsheng made a comeback. Qin Bigao rushed out to save, but Li Yichen waved his strange leg and cleverly hit the upper corner. Lido took the lead 1-0. Three minutes later, Yichen got the ball and charged in alone. Cai Shengmiao, Zhuang Youren, and Shu Shigeng were unable to stop him, and Li swept the ball into the net, making it 2-0. The first half ended, with Everlast trailing by two goals. After the intermission, Everlast's three forwards were all transferred, and the situation changed dramatically. After fifteen minutes, Yichen shot angrily at the twelve-yard spot, and Qin Bigao could not save it. Lido went up another level. Not long after, Zhang Mingsheng passed the ball low from the periphery towards the goal, Qin Bigao rushed out, and it actually leaked into the net, making the score 4-0. Everlast counterattacked, and Wu Binghao scored two goals in five minutes. Suddenly, the whistle sounded long, and Lido won 4-2.</p>
