<p>社評</p>
<h3>所謂「華興銀行」</h3>
<p>日本嗾使華中僞組識和日本各銀行合組的「華興銀行」，已於日昨在上海宣佈成立，並傳即將發行僞鈔，用以奪取現在日軍占領區域內流通的中國法幣。日本為破壞中國戰時金融，和實現她的所謂「日圓集團」起見，去年曾用所謂「聯合準備銀行」的名義而發行僞「聯銀」鈔票，現在這種僞鈔的價值，正在銳跌之中。據最近路透電訊，華北僞鈔掉換法幣，升水已達百分之三四·五。以彼例此，不難覘知所謂「華興銀行」的前途；</p>
<p>一個國家的貨幣制度，要建立起來固然非常艱難，要破壞牠也是很不容易。以中國法幣制度基礎的穩固，和全國人民愛護國家的忠貞，日本任何金融上的陰謀，決不會獲得意外的收穫，這已由華北僞鈔的失敗得一鐵證；並且日本對於中國法幣制度的破壞，這祗是一種企圖，實際上絕無那種能力。華北僞鈔的失敗，是有準備其名而無其實，以致無從取得外匯。這决即將發行的華中僞鈔，當然也是無所謂準備的。或有人以為將用日圓為準備，但日本國內的紙幣發行額，去年底已膨漲到二十九億圓；紙幣的準備金，大部分已消耗於軍需品的購買。若果華中僞鈔以日圓為準備，間接的就是加速日本紙幣的臌漲，或有人以為將用外鈔為準備，但在目前各民主國家的反侵略運動進行中，誰願負擔幫助侵略的責任？現在日本在國際間的信用，不要說毫無保證的支持中國僞鈔的借欵，不會有着落；就是所謂實業建設的借欵，在日本現時排斥在華歐美權益的政策下，也早已封閉了告貸的門戶。據傳去年僞滿曾向美國商借一千萬鐵路用具放欵，也遭受美國方面的拒絕。或有人以為將以偽鈔掉法幣，而以法幣的準備為準備，這雖是日本的希望，事實上却極渺茫，因為中國政府對於外滙，久已加以極嚴格的統制。或有人以為用輸出商品的外滙，可以作為準備，此事雖有可能，但是望梅何能止渴，所謂眞正的準備，除却日本軍人的手槍和利刃還有甚麼呢？</p>
<p>其實日本何常不知道：現在華北的僞鈔，旣不能破壞中國的法幣制度：將來的華中僞鈔，還不是和華北的僞鈔一樣，絕對沒有和中國法幣對抗的能力。但是日本在目前民窮財盡的時候，為了妄想要達到創造「東亞新秩序」的幻夢，却不能不採取這種發行僞鈔的辦法；所以日本嗾使僞組識逐漸擴大僞鈔發行的範圍，絕不是替僞組織建立什麼貨幣制度的基礎。僞鈔的發行，對於僞組織的關係，最多不過是現在日本在經濟上無力接濟的時候，僞組織可以在軍事佔領區內借一筆經濟的血債罷了。日本眞正的目的，乃是想假藉日圓集團的利便，一方面盡量剝削中國各遊擊區域內人民的血汗，以為對華作戰的暫時的支持；一方面以僞鈔為根據而統制外匯，極力排斥歐美在華的一切權力。</p>
<p>現在僞鈔在中國遊擊區內所具有的唯一作用，就是便利對日貿易：即在中國遊擊區內，用僞鈔來强制收買貨物，轉運出口，取得外匯，加以統制；出口的商人必須把外匯售給僞銀行，進口的商人必須事先取得外匯的供給，這在華北即是如此辦法，如去年日本對華北的貿易，無論進口出口，都較前年增加一倍；同時還可以利用日本所不需要的中國商品，去換取日本軍事上所需要的各種原料，如華北僞「聯銀」所訂立的所謂具有優先權的入口貨物表，最先供給外滙的完全為日軍的用品。相反的歐美其他各國對華北的貿易，進出口商品不是遭受日本限制，就是毫無利益可圖，於是貿易額都大减而特减。日本現在為獲得更多的原料和更大的市塲，並為着更積極的排斥歐美各國在華的權益，自然是要把僞鈔發行的範圍擴大到華中區域來。</p>
<p>中國政府對於日本這種的企圖，事先本已有了預防，如禁止內地和游擊區域間貨物的自由流通，戰區地方金融的改善，和整理，以及游擊戰士對於使用偽鈔者的嚴厲處置，這都是對付日本發行僞鈔的有效辦法；因之這决日本企圖在華中發行僞鈔，對於中國法幣的破壞能力，自是有限得很。就目前實際情形而言，將來華中僞鈔的流通，總不外日本武力直接控制的幾個較大的都市，而遭受巨大影響的，當為生活在這些區域內的中國人民，和經營華中區域對外貿易的歐美僑商，允其是後者，將有遭遇到和華北同樣環境的可能，這是歐美在華僑民所應當特別往意的。在僞「華興銀行」成立的時候，據說上海中外銀行及錢莊業，决定不與合作。這是上海中外人民，為了保全他們自身在華中的經濟利益，必然的辦法啊！</p>

<h3>華軍士兵王書麟　盜取日方軍郵記</h3>
<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>化裝農夫深入岳陽日陣　獲得許多抗戰參考資料</p>
<p>在長沙時、即聞湘北華軍第×師士兵王書麟、深入日陣盜取大批日方軍郵歸來之訊、因於四月二日由長出發湘北陣中視察途中、探詢該士兵所屬部隊之駐在地、擬作一度訪談、及抵汨羅、始知該部正警備新墻河南岸第一綫陣地、四月十日、行抵新墻河附近該師師部、彼適叉奉命出發岳陽價察敵情、交臂失之、十六日、始在汩羅江南岸之×××見之、蓋又巳完成任務、並獲得日方文件書箱等、安然歸來矣、</p>
<p>王君容貌淸秀、身材適中衣黑色短衫褲、怐怐答記者所問各節、條理分明、目甚謙抑、然進退舉措、一望而知曾受軍人教育有年、彼於報告完畢後、猶深以報國有心、學餐不足為憾、旅中適携有日本的間諜一書、因特增之、期或能稍增間諜常識也、</p>
<p>據第×師參謀主任所言、王君頗具胆識、且企圖心甚大、每决出動、必於原定任務外、以獵獲其他為快、富彼發覺其問諜細胞有反間諜行動時、必力除之、固一天才問諜也、茲紀王君之談話如次、</p>
<p>我名呌王書麟、岳腸×××人、今年二十三歲、父親巳經故世、母親已六十多歲、和兄嫂們仍在×××耕作度日、勉强可以溫飽、</p>
<p>十四歲時、我在鄉裏的小學校畢業、投入岳陽縣政府保安隊當勤務兵、一年以後就正式當了保安隊員、十七歲時、覺得當保安隊的前途有限、就由朋友介紹到南京入警備司令部機關槍營、民國二十六年十二月、這機關槍營改由陸軍第五十一師指揮、十二月十三日、在首都南門外雨花台附近作戰受傷、先後在湘北黃岡和武昌的傷兵醫院醫治去年一月底回到岳陽家裹養傷、到三月裏就全愈了、我看國家到了這步田地、年輕人做事、沒有比當兵更好的了、所以又加入岳陽的常備隊、去年十一月裏、第×師在新墻一帶作戰、因為我是常地人、就被錄用、任下士便衣隊員、</p>
<p>五個月來、我和便衣隊的同志們、時常出入岳陽一帶敵人的後方、偵察敵情、先後被捕過四决、都給我脫逃了、我盜取敵人的軍郵這回事、就是在我第一决被捕後撞到的一個機會、</p>
<p>那是在一月九日、我奉命由袁紹忠村附近的遊擊營出發、赴岳陽以東三四十里地的雲溪車站附近偵察、到平地全家化較了一個農夫、挑了一担紅薯向北進入敵人的警戒綫、事先、我獲得了一塊所謂一良民證一的布條、（的四寸長、二寸半寬、上面橫書「身元證明一、下面分塡姓名」「住所」「職業」「年齡」各項、下署×××自洽委員會」、除該會鈴記外、布角上有「內藤」橢圓形小印一顆、）敵人因為要引誘人民回鄉、所以看到這塊布條就讓我通過、在敵我兩軍的第一綫之閒、有十多里的地方、老百姓仍舊在耕種、敵人的一般工事、和我們的並沒有多大差別、不過據點工事大都用鋼骨水泥搆築的、外面還有兩三道鐵絲網、一定得用大砲才能把它轟坍、掩蔽得很好、就是在近處、有時也很難發覺、我到了雲溪車站、就給十幾個鬼子兵閉住了、他們起先隨意拿我的紅暮吃、最後、來了一個憲兵、勸我當僞軍、並用槍逼着我走、雲溪的市街接近火車站、走不多遠、就折逃一家市房裏去、這房子四週也聞着鐵絲網、我一邊走進去、一邊就留心着出路、那是一並排三間的屋子、他把我推進中間的一間、並且把我反鎖起來、</p>
<p>屋了裏已經有五六個二三十歲的種田人、大家又氣又怕的坐在乾草上、他們雖不認識我、却也為我的不幸表示同悄、看那窗格子、並不怎樣結實、我想、要逃也許只有這條路、</p>
<p>我進去時是下午三點多鐘、五點鐘打過、另一個憲兵、忽然把鬥打開了、呼喚我出去他用手表示要我為他們打掃房屋、我欣然拿起箕帚、左手的一聞房門上掛着大日本郵便局」的牌子、探頭向窗子裏看去、常窗的狹長的桌子上堆滿了許多信和紙捲子，猜定它是軍郵局、右手的一間是灶屋、我一眼瞥見刀砧上擺着亮閃閃的一把菜刀、七八寸長二寸來寬、倒有些像屠刀、我把他掃好、趁鬼子兵不備、就拿了藏進上衣裏面、然後依舊讓他把我倒鎖在當中的一間屋子裏、給了我一小筒子機米飯、上面有一小塊挺腥的鹹魚、</p>
<p>我默默地把刀藏在草裏一運同屋子的人、都沒有知道、接着、我坐近墻、眼望着窗外漸漸地暗沉下來的天色、聽着鬼子兵的皮鞋和馬蹄的聲音、一面反背着手、用刀把地上挖了一個小小的坑、把刀埋在裏面、天黑了、同屋的人、都昏昏地倒在草上睡着了、聽聽外面、走路的人也减少了、我就在黑暗裏抽出那把刀、開始慢慢的割斷那窗格子、費了兩個多鐘點、才取下了三根、是容一個鑽出去、</p>
<p>大的是十一點鐘、聽到鬼子兵好大鼾聲、我就跳出窗口、同時、決心要盜取了軍郵之後再逃走方無足走到「郵便屋」的窗前、推了推、裏面扣着、用力去橇、也不動一桌子上的兩大包郵件、在暗淡的夜色中引誘着我、先輕輕的把玻璃打碎、然後伸手進去打開窗子、才一手挾住一包、却不知道還是因烏一時心慌呢、還是那狹長的桌子沒有擺穩、「孔隆」地翻了過去、這樣、我就只有三十六着、定為上着了、我立即大步竄出屋子、跨過鐵絲網的短門、飛關地向西南方面的黑暗中在奔、敵人的憲兵跟蹤的追了出來、槍聲一響、躲在工事裏的敵人、也像所謂一犬吠影、百犬吠聲的盲日地向黑暗中開槍了、跑了三四里、敵人的槍彈、仍是呼呼地在我頭上飛過、這時覺得携帶的束西太重、（每包郵件的有八九斤重）走不快、決意忍痛捨棄一包、這樣再走了六七里、綿密的槍聲、才遠落在後面、</p>
<p>於是我在小山上的松林裏休息了一回、然後慢慢地提着那一包郵件婦來、</p>
<p>黎明、要穿過敵人的岳陽以南新建的汽車路、看見在半里路外、有六七個哨兵在向我這邊走來、我若無其事的穿過了、等到他們發現我、高聲呌我站住時我已經穿進路邊山林、他們追了一陣、終究沒有敢追進樹林裏來、</p>
<p>兩天之後、回到師部、呈獻了我的戰利品、並詳細報告了經過情形、那一包郵件是用日本滿包裹着的、裏面一共有四百多對信、幾十捲報紙和雜誌、立刻就轉呈到上級的軍部裏去、後來我知道這裏面有許多材料給我們做參考、敵軍士兵的厭戰、也有了更新鮮的證明、其中還有一份、敵軍人見部隊在南宿州和我們作戰受傷者的名單、一大隊中、（記者按、日軍一大隊山四個連組成、每連二百十餘人、共有輕重機關槍七十餘挺、火力較我一團吒盛）、負傷者達一百五十人、陣亡者尚不在內、漢奸辦的「武漢報」、也初决看見了、</p>
<p>師長常時就獎賞了我二十元、沒有幾天、軍部和軍團部也先後各賞了二百兀獎金、又把我從下士升做上士、我眞非常感激、不過對於賞金和升級、並不是我所以要工作的目的、我只恨讀書太少、對於國家沒有更多的帮助、</p>
<p>我到岳陽時、常遇見津田聯隊長、獨自騎一頭洋馬、執了一枝手槍、到他所强佔的我們的女同胞蒙裏去、我眞想設法帶一枝槍去結果了他、但為了更大的目的、我還沒有奉到呌我這麼辦的命令、（四月七日在汨羅南岸××）</p>

<h3>德平輪今晨抵埠　寗波昨又被炸</h3>
<p>昨上午日機五架投十餘彈　滬定昨已復航定甬綫不通　高登一度失去自由</p>
<p>郵縣二日電、今晨九時許、日水上轟炸機五架、自龍山方向侵入寗波上空、大肆轟炸、計燬中心醫院等處市房二十餘間、死傷二十餘人、同時日艦三艘、在鎭海口外向華方砲擊十餘發、</p>
<p>意商中意公司德平輪船、本月一日、受寗波同鄉會僱用、載運大批醫藥用品及醫師看護等、馳往寗波、辦理急救、二日早晨、駛抵鎭海口外七里峙地方、因遇日艦向鎭海口開砲、不能進口、寗波同鄉會得訊、電令折回、該輪於前晚十時、即由七里峙開回上海、巳於昨晨八時、駛進吳淞口、旋由日軍派兵士登輸檢查、至下午六時、方始檢查完竣、本可開進浦江、又因傍晚、水上戒嚴、不克開入、須俟今晨六時、方可開抵碼頭、昨晚八時、寗波同鄉會特電該輸慰勞、茲錄原電如决、「穆子湘先生轉諸位醫師護士公鑒、今晚水上戒跋未便上岸、準明晨派晨在碼頭迎候、先電慰勞、寗波同鄉會虞和德等同叩、」云云、</p>
<p>寗波城區　昨又被炸</p>
<p>寗波自上月一十八日、被日機轟炸後、繼於本月一日、再度被炸、其死傷及燬損狀况、巳誌昨報外、詎昨日上午十時十分鐘、寗波再遭轟炸、當時計來日機五架、投十餘彈、城內縣前街中心醫院建船街錢業會館隔壁、均被炸、關於死傷及燬損詳情、則滬上尚無報告、</p>
<p>鄞縣報吿　被炸災況</p>
<p>關於上月二十八日及本月一日之被炸概况、鄞縣長陳寳麟、特向寗波旅滬同鄉會報告云、「寗波旅滬同鄉會鑒、電悉、貴會關懷桑梓、至堪欽佩、此决甬市被炸、至查明者、計死百三十餘人、重傷百十餘人、輕傷者百餘人落水及葬身火塲瓦礫中者、現尚在發掘中、又燬屋一千餘間、大小民船十四艘、東再度被炸、區域江東大校塲·新河頭·灰街·大戴家弄·百丈街·及靈橋門·九如巷·一帶、死四十餘人、傷百餘人、燬屋一千數百間、特聞、陳寳麟、冬、」</p>

<p>定甬航綫　暫吿斷絕</p>

<p>高登一度　失去自由</p>
<p>昨日盛傳德商魯麟洋行船務部之高登輸、在穿山洋面被日艦扣去、第據大通社記者探悉、該輪於上月三十日午後四時起、其無綫電確未曾與上海公司通電、惟自昨晨起、已照常可以通報、該輸現已停泊定海、對甬定綫則暫停駛、當其無錢電不能與滬通報時、顯為失去行動自由之時間也、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（三日）公共租界內數處商店及住戶、因濟南慘案紀念而懸中國國旗、巡捕請彼等收下、大多均從其言、蓋當局與納稅華人會商妥懸國旗之八日中、今日不在其內也、同孚路懸旗者頗多、內有婦女內衣店八家、拒不收下國旗、並謂每年此日、必懸國旗、巡捕見共不從、即召到大批後備隊巡捕紅色警備車一輛、並有白俄商團三卡車、到塲後繞立四週、然後復告八店主下旗、店丰再度拒絕、乃遭巡捕拘往成都路捕房、當時未起紛撿、捕房中復告八店主謂如收下國旗、卽將彼等釋放、不久、旗幟取下、警備車與白俄商團亦離傷、一塲風波、乃告平息、</p>

<h3>日軍攻塘灣被繳械　全數驅逐出境</h3>
<p>淞滬遊擊隊予日重創　京滬線日軍趕築工事</p>
<p>日海軍陸戰隊三十餘名、由滬閔公路經北橋、擬往塘　進攻游擊隊、孰料游擊隊已得密報、及時均散伏民房、日兵進抵該鎭、因不見行踪、疑游擊隊震「皇軍」威名、己逃避他鄉、乃整隊魚貫而入及行至塘灣小學附近時、游擊隊四面術出、將日軍團團包國、日軍始知中伏、悔巳不及、奮欲頑抗、勢又不敵、祇得棄械求救、游擊隊乃將日軍槍械繳獲後、即將徒手日人、全數驅逐出境、未加殺害、</p>
<p>淞滬區　游擊捷報</p>
<p>本月二十五日下午一時許、日軍以汽艇吻艘、載兵八十餘名、由衙前方面駛抵淞滬游擊隊獨立第大隊駐防之某地登陸、直撲大隊部時該部已隱聞汽艇聲、即展聞陣地、故立時接火、一時槍聲甚密、正酣戰間、乃又續到汽艇兩艘、滿載軍火、及日軍六十餘名、由該部背後登陸、兩路夾攻、迫不得已、向北移動避免、至廊下東之某地、重又展開血戰、由第一　兩中隊擔任正面攻擊、由大隊長親率第三中隊、繞至敵之後方予以重重包圍、時國軍四十五旅亦開訊派隊援應、士氣大振、無論官兵、均奮不顧身、向前直衝、殺聲震大、彈密如雨、當塲擊斃日軍四十餘名、重傷六七十人、正擬將其殘餘完全殲滅、乃日軍又續到援軍三百餘名、滿裝八汽艇、由第三中隊陣地衝入、時囚天晚、且又衆寡懸殊、乃守件陣地、停止前進、日亦不敢戀戰、收拾死屍傷兵、滿裝四汽艇、退向金山而去、按此役轉戰十餘里、血戰四小時、游擊隊僅死士兵一名傷兩名、而此陣亡之士兵邵尉文、初祇胸部受一槍傷、乃將創口以豆葉塞滿、裏傷再戰、重又肉搏、殺死日軍一名後、以力竭致壯烈犧牲於刺刀下、而日軍以四五百之衆、潰竄時竟於農民身上、攫得便衣而逃、</p>

<h3>偽「華興銀行」紙幣　難與法幣平值　無限制獲得外滙亦難　外籍銀行家觀察所得</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨日（二日）外傳愧儡管理之華興商業銀行所發紙幣、刻圖大量流通於虹口及楊樹浦、蘇州河南屋並未發現其蹤跡、外輸銀行家對於該行成立時保證將新幣半價緊隨法幣、及可以新幣獲得無限　外滙兩節、仍信其</p>
<p>不易實行</p>
<p>星期一日某着名外箱銀行家、已向記者述及、昨日復據聲稱、新銀行欲保持其諾言、唯一辦法、即實行相類於日當局在華北實行之出口限制是、咋日又據某銀行家稱、但須知上海之情况與華北大不相同、日方將吾在此間實施</p>
<p>出口限制</p>
<p>殊屬可疑、渠並以為該銀行所發紙幣、目前無論其可想像之支持若何堅强、在此情勢下、無成功之可能云、又據華籍銀行家聲稱、彼等對於華興銀行、除見諸報端者外、不知其他、又上海泰曙士報云、中日台辦之筆興商業銀行、星期一日在此間成立、其紙幣猶堆積</p>
<p>地下室中</p>
<p>昨（二日）晚該銀行人員對昨日某本埠英文晚報所稱新「虹口」貨幣出現云云、加以嘲笑、據稱、該銀行尚未開始營業、故絕無紙幣流通於外、今定五月十日或稍遲開業、</p>
<h3>商號發票　為何不貼印花</h3>
<p>購物時應注意糾正　本報讀者舉發一例</p>
<p>本報昨晚接到本埠署名石志華君來函一封、該函的內容、係公佈一家商店冀園在發票上漏貼印花而起的一件小小的糾粉、表面上看起來好像是一樁細微的事情、但是內容確攸關國家整個的稅收、為特將來函披露於後、尚祈全體商界人仕注意及之、</p>
<p>編者先生</p>
<p>你的光陰是極寶貴的、我本不願來打攪你、但是這裏的一件事、以拙見看起來、也是很關重要的、所以使我不得不來打攪先生一决、那麼就請先生化一分鐘聽我告訴你、本月一日的下午六時十分、我到一家唱機公司、為朋友代購</p>
<p>唱片一張</p>
<p>計價二元七角五分、當時余付以五元紙幣一張、當找還我二元二角五分、但不見發票、余以各商店售貨、凡在一元以上者均須粘貼印花、且售價均有發票、且余係為友人代購者更以有發票為宜、當向之索、該店員則對日、「還要發票麼、」蓋彼</p>
<p>蓄意漏貼</p>
<p>印花巳　言外、因我堅索、未幾持一發票交我、不見印花而見一藍色之方章、印有「應貼印花、郵局停售、無從照納、」字樣、余以印花早經發到、該號一再意閱漏稅、當即詢以何以仍用此等圖章、而不貼印花、該店員則聲稱不能購得、余向之理論、伊反</p>
<p>無理辨白</p>
<p>後竞以威脅熊度稱、「我們買不到印花、你能買得到、你與我一同去買、」我則堅持非貼印花不買貨、要彼退款、彼又不肯、因此爭論頗久、有購貨者二人、亦加入抗議、與之理論、人愈集愈多、後另一店員持二分印花黏於票上交我</p>
<p>一場風波</p>
<p>方息、衆購貨者亦均空手而去、余以印花乃商人對於國家應有之納稅義務、本市雖會一度停售、然巳早經發到、此决該商號意圖漏貼印花、雖祇二分、然誠恐非祇此一决、亦非祇此一家、事關國家之稅收、一二分錢雖少、然集少而成多、倘本市各商店均起而效允則</p>
<p>國家損失</p>
<p>亦殊可觀、况漏貼印花即損害國家、且此事輕而易舉、且對國家補益非淺、祇望凡我同胞人人盡監督漏貼印花之義務、則國稅得維完整、並望社會人士、對於漏貼印花者、加以懲戒、以警後效、尚乞貴報不惜一角、將此宜布、以便周知、責報所以為民族服務、余亦可略盡國民之義務也、此致申報主筆先生合鑒、公民石志華謹啟、</p>
<h3>偽「交通部」企圖　攫取招商局舊產　衛利韓公司倉庫碼頭　竟亦列入接收產權中</h3>
<p>僞「維新政府交通部」、希圖復活前國營招商局、要求日方將長江各埠前招商局之碼頭倉庫、歸僞「部」接收、而其計劃中、將國民政府售與美商衛利韓公司之招商局上海倉庫碼頭四處產業、即　浦東招商新棧、　浦東招商華棧、　虹口招商中棧、　招商北棧、亦列入接收之例、聞執有四棧產權之衛利韓當局、對此堅決反對、如僞「部果圖實現此項計劃、則將請求該國使領、再向日方交涉、以維台法權益、</p>
<h3>偽「綏靖隊」　突然反正</h3>
<p>在直塘與支塘之間　押隊日軍官均槍決</p>
<p>連日錫滬公路一帶、時有截擊軍用及商用汽車之事件發生、以致引起日方恐慌不安、為「綏靖」沿綫華軍起見、特於本月一日、由常熟開出卡車一輛、滿載僞「綏靖隊一員二十餘、有日軍官二名押隊、先駛往直塘站搜索、但當地華軍事前聞訊後、均已遠颺、致一無所獲、即乘原車向支塘站進發、詎料駛至猛將廟（直塘與支塘之間）附近、該僞「綏靖隊」即行反正、當將押隊日軍官兩名槍決、並將汽車縱火燒燬、後以身上所穿之黃色制服均剝去、携槍散入鄉間、嗣後支塘日警備隊長得訊、即派大隊日軍馳赴出事地點搜查、亳無結果、自此事發生後、日方對僞羣警監視、非常嚴密、誠恐再有同樣事件、</p>
<h3>猪業昨函租界當局　請求救濟</h3>
<p>向各華董請願援助　限制市價以維民食</p>
<p>鮮猪行業五月一日被虹口「牲畜市塲」扣去之鮮猪一千餘頭、經各猪行以受貨人資格向承運公司嚴重交涉、並聲明保留損害賠償後、由該承運公司等轉向該僞市塲交涉、始於二日午後、全部送還、但仍欲外加每猪四角幾分之費用、被受貨猪行</p>
<p>堅决拒絕</p>
<p>昨日（二日）下午五時許、由火車運到之鮮猪共八輛、的四百餘頭、叉被虹口「牲畜市塲」攔奪、現正考慮對策、必要時擬向某當局</p>
<p>提起控吿</p>
<p>該「市塲」日籍理事長松田增吉及華理事長沈秉權即孫宏洋、該公會於五月一日午後、推代表顧葆相等、晋謁華董虞洽卿袁履登江一平等、請求援助</p>
<p>當荷允諾</p>
<p>該會並於二日分函公共租界工部局法租界公董局函略云、竊本會係全市鮮猪行業之總樞、在公共租界及法租界設賣買市塲兩處、自虹口設立「上海牲畜市塲」、一再將本業各行之</p>
<p>到貨提去</p>
<p>如五月一日有自日淸汽船株式會社上海支店所屬之雲海丸裝猪二百餘頭、又捷興公司所屬之淡海丸裝猪六百餘頭、又米丸裝猪三百餘頭、來滬後即被該「上海牲畜市塲」擅自提去、且據該</p>
<p>巿場揚言</p>
<p>以後如經日輸裝運鮮猪到滬、仍須繼續提去、查營業自由、為任何國家之通例、龔斷商業、為法所不許、苟鮮猪一業可以任意壟斷、則其他各業、亦將决第操縱、此種行為、</p>
<p>充到極度</p>
<p>將使上海整個經濟機構、趨於崩潰、或使上海租界治安、發生重大危機、在貴局為尊重行政職權及維護界內數百萬人口民食起見似應</p>
<p>鄭重考慮</p>
<p>設法救濟、為公衆謀福利、母任不法之企圖縱長蔓延、則不僅本業一業之幸、為此瀝陳事實、迅賜設法維護、以安商業、</p>
<h3>外輪維持　滬閩航綫</h3>
<p>邇來日艦日機、專在浙間沿海一帶、騷投轟炸、各海口因之封鎖、航業影饗甚鉅、至福州方面、雖船雙不便駛入閩江、但外輪仍拋泊於馬屋口、裝卸貨物、惟江內貨駁之出口、須待無日機轟炸時、方可駛出、現悉</p>
<p>中意公司</p>
<p>之格蘭·巴陀拉·兩輸、在福州口待裝木料、泉州·與化·亦尚安謐、今午十一時太古公司之新疆輸、由滬赴汕頭、兼灣泉州、運去竹糧甚夥、又</p>
<p>怡和洋行</p>
<p>利生輸、現在興化、日內即經福州返滬、的六日可抵埠、至預定九日再由本市直放福州·興化、惟在此軍事時期、對於航行、隨時或生變化、臨時通知客商、</p>

<h3>要求遏制反日　日方宣言强硬</h3>
<p>兩宣言未送租界當局　僅於招待記者時宣佈　　大陸報云、日軍報道部昨（二日）晚在招待記者席上宣佈措辭强硬之宜言兩通、內要求公共租界工部局與法租界立刻採取遏制兩區中一切反日活動之步　、報道部發言人稱、此兩宣言並未正式送交工部局、惟希望引起工部局</p>
<p>對此宣言</p>

<h3>撞車慘案　西捕頭已能發言　警務人員曾往晤談　根據所述繕入報吿</h3>
<p>字林報云、四月二十四日夜汽車肇禍案所述、李里與日哨兵一名殞命、李里夫人受傷、公共租界警務處西捕頭維姆塞特亦受重傷、看護維氏之醫生、昨（二日）晨准許調查此案之警務人員與維氏晤談移時、維氏已能發言、報界未能獲得維氏</p>
<p>所言內容</p>
<p>關於擊禍情勢之文件、業巳繕成、今將以維氏之言加入其內、由於維氏之衰弱、昨日往公濟醫院晤彼者、僅在其病室中勾留數分鐘、聞英領事署人員、定今日或明日往晤維氏、昨日衆信日當局亦將往英領事署請領事署代表偕同往晤維氏、俾　其言、昨日日方招待</p>

<h3>英艦蟋蟀號到滬　載來大批漢口外僑</h3>
<p>到滬後卽與　螂號拆毀　英江防新艦將先後來華</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、英艦蟋蟀號由漢口載來外僑、今日（三日）可抵滬埠、將作最後一决之航行、因該江防砲艦不久將與其姊妹艦螳螂號、出售拆毀也、瓜代之兩新英艦為蚱蜢號與蜻蜓號、今已起　駛出、明年叉有江防新砲艦兩艘將駛華、復有兩舊艦將拆毀、蟋蟀號此次係偕懸賀爾特少將旗幟之英艦蠍號、由</p>
<p>漢口下駛</p>
<p>載有漢口外僑三十九人、彼等均因日方限制第三國輸船與人民之行動、故以前不得離漢、蠍號定下午二時三十分抵此、蟋蟀號拖有英海軍載油駁船一艘、駛抵吳淞、將不得不解下駁船之纜、而稍遲入港、蠍號係數月前駛華、瓜代蜜蜂號、而任揚子江艦隊之旗艦</p>
<p>設計新穎</p>
<p>其凈噸位雖較蜜蜂號為輕、但載艦員較多、半因其載砲較小故也、蜻蜓及蚱蜢兩號與蠍號頗相類、叉英艦蚊號與蝗蟲號今在英國建造中、明年出站、亦將編入揚子江艦隊、現有之「昆蟲級」江防砲艦、或卒將全部代以「新昆蟲級」兵艦、螳螂號今泊掦子江中、即將作最後一次之航行、因該艦與蟋蟀號之艦員預定</p>
<p>將赴香港</p>
<p>然後接替由英駛港之蚱蜢與蜻蜓兩新砲艦艦員、該兩艦將在港演習後駛來上海、定六月十四或十五日抵埠、按「昆蟲級」各艦於於世界大戰時在近東服務、各重六二五噸、載六吋口徑大砲兩門、旋</p>
<p>調駐中國</p>
<p>在揚子江與珠江服務、每逢夏季、可溯江駛至重慶、「昆蟲級」共有兵艦十一艘、內八艘泊揚子江、三艘泊廣州附近、英國揚子江艦隊復有較小之砲艦若干艘、均取野飛禽之名、英國江防砲艦殊衆，故上海常見之、</p>

<h3>結婚與體健的關係</h3>
<p>結婚誠是件人生大事。雖然說：『婚後將增加負擔』。或是說：『結婚是愛情的墳墓』。但男女一至成年以後，誰能超脫此關呢。人不能做超人，那一個肯放棄他人生應享的幸福？大批大批的男女，必要往結婚之路前進，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>結婚果是為得幸福的追求，一個精力充沛的健壯男子一旦和一個健美多姿的女郎結為伉儷，他們當然在愛的氛圍里，度著甜蜜的日子，生男育女，組織著快樂的家庭，幸福豈可限量？并因有愛情的調濟與鼓勵，他的生活必然美滿。快樂與進取是相連擊的，心曠體胖，健康進步，人生也變得樂觀了。因此，在人生的旅途中，邁開大步，鼓勇前進，無論在學術與事業上都有很大的好處。所以一個健康男子的結婚，真是他幸福生活的開始。</p>
<p>可是男子如果於早年犯有自瀆與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，以及其他愛勞　傷之故，在性機能上爆發滑精漏精，早泄陽萎，精力渙散，久婚不育，發育不全等癥。則雖結婚，不特沒有幸福，將徒增煩惱而已，因為辜負了妻之熱情，蹉跎了妻之青春，當此花開時節，她怎能不悲忿填膺，而感慨憂傷系之！其性情較為強硬者，竟另結私歡，或與夫訴請離婚之訟者，不是時有所聞嗎？所以體弱的男子，在沒有把他的隱病治愈之前，對于結婚一事，我勸他還是以暫緩的好。因為不特無幸福可言，恐身體益將弄壞，衰弱男子，於婚後形成未老先衰，或竟一病嗚呼，做短命之鬼者，亦是很多的一切疾病均貴及早作澈底治療，尤以上述各癥為然。若遷延不治，勢必致『因小而失大』。然亡羊補牢，猶為未晚。上述各癥，治療方法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服生殖腺素制劑『生殖素』，最為對癥特效。因此劑於服後即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，輕者約一週可愈，重者二三週亦可恢復美滿的健康。惟有遺精者，須兼服『希米脫氏固精片』，以固精關，制止遺匯，則標本兼治，收效尤速。患者如能親來本診所施用電療，注射，手術等多種科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯美與幸福</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>世界上那一種女性最幸福呢？這當然是健美的姑娘，或是有著伶俐孩子的母親，健美的姑娘。到處受人歡迎，好像她的四週有著靈光。聰明孩子的母親，組織著快樂的家庭，她好似美麗而偉大的花園主人，雖然辛勤地工作，但有著無限的快慰！</p>
<p>然她們怎能獲得這樣幸福呢？此在生理學上研究，完全由于卵巢機能的健全，與新陳代謝作用的旺盛所致。因為卵巢機能健全。乳峯即有良好的發育，臀部亦必發達異常，於是女性最神秘的曲線美即可形成·因新陳代謝作用旺盛之故，在皮膚，肌肉，血液等部，均產生多量的新細胞，所以皮膚就白嫩，肌肉就豐腴，面頰自然就紅潤。這種女性是時代之花，其幸福自然無量！但過去如因束胸自瀆，月經不調，白帶不感，後後虧弱，以及重癥侵害，以致卵巢機能遭遇摧殘，影響乳峯發育者，則不但失去動人的美姿，抑且每為男子所厭惡，幸福毫無！唯一補救辦法。祇有立即服以卵巢制劑女用『生殖素』。即一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，消滅子宮病患，促進妊娠機能，如繼續服用，不惟可使萎　的乳峯，漸漸高聳，變得富有彈性，同時還能使憔悴的面頰，變得嬌艷欲滴，嫵媚動人，增進健美。</p>
<h3>遺精的起因和惡果</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>自瀆是不受支持上人最壞的惡習，遺精癥的十之八九都是由自瀆而起。此外因用腦過度，或神經受了某種的刺激，失卻了正常的作用，也會有遺精癥。總之，青年人之所以有遺精，除了染有淋毒，精關發生炎癥的原因之外，大都為神經衰弱的徵兆。</p>
<p>精液在我人體內，功能助長發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，滋養各部神經。若因遺精頻繁而流失過多。腦、脊髓，性，三天神經益受摧殘，凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，滑精漏精，早泄陽萎，精力渙散，久婚不育等癥象必相繼而來。同時發育機能亦受其阻止，新陳代謝作用亦因以減退，形成發育不全，身材低矮，局部短小一如童稚者有之，也有面黃肌瘦，精神萎頓，未老而已先衰者有之。此種青年，日常多病多痛，在學術與事業上何能與人競勝，就是人生不可少的夫婦生活上亦必不能慰藉其妻，而為妻痛恨！家庭因以多故，幸福喪盡；生活蒙受痛苦，前途毫無希望，或竟縮短了天年！</p>
<p>遺精的治療方法，雖有多端，但最對癥而特效者，當首推『希米脫氏固精片』，因此藥於服後即能鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，夜聞夢幻減少，可得安眠，則遺精自然痊愈。須兼服生殖腺素制劑『生殖素』，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可早日恢復美滿健康。患者若能親來本診所施用電療，注射，手術等各種科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<p>白濁論壇</p>
<p>— 淋病專科戴德醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：北京路四川路轉角</p>
<p>義務送診僅收號金四角</p>
<h3>白濁爲何威脅生殖</h3>
<p>威脅生殖之白濁今已解除</p>
<p>因淋病乏嗣者均皆大歡喜</p>
<p>一般人以爲淋病發生於尿道，爲何與生殖上有這樣大的影響，多以爲是危詞聳聽之事，豈知大診不然也。我人之生殖要素，必須具有如此幾個條件，（一）爲製造精子機關。（二）爲涵養精子原料。製造精子機關如有毁損，即失去製造精子之機能，於是精子即無從製造。一種精子有如蝌蚪，游泳於攝護腺液內，此攝護腺液，即精虫資爲生活者。而製造精子之機關即睪丸。在淋病之併發症中，睪丸炎與攝護腺炎爲最多。而攝護腺炎，較之睪丸炎尤易犯之。此二種症狀，均各有其特效。攝護腺炎，往往因失治而成攝護腺漏，大便努責時，即有白色液體從尿道口逸出。因而浪費攝護腺液。至於睪丸炎一症，如發生一側者則尚有一個可製造精虫，如兩邊皆患炎症則生殖必告絶望。余以十數年之經騐，用德國希氏血淸，及勒氏攝護腺按摩法，對症而用。更以德國濾淋平流電療法，透入病灶，撲滅淋菌，則所有威脅生殖力之攝護腺炎，睪丸炎等症，均可速治，並能恢復生殖機能，　　可自信而敢保證也。</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>上海人的晚餐</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>上海人的早餐，很隨便，很草率的，而上海人的晚餐，却很請究，不肯馬虎的，這裏，可以來一說他的原因。</p>
<p>我們知道，海上繁華之盛，不在於白晝，却在於夜晚，一到華證初上，霓紅光的照耀，煊染半天，而酒樓，舞榭，書寓，劇院，旅舍等處，笙歌鼎沸，樂聲鏗鏘，使你陶醉，使你沉湎！於是每到晚餐的辰光，呼朋引類，踏上餐館，經濟些的，經濟小吃，（雖然小吃，也非兩三元不辦）闊綽些的，吃整席，吃大菜，席間猜拳，行令，引杯轟飲，往往興之所至，呌局賞花，當筵一曲，或招導女來，唱「桃花江」，「乳燕曲」，「何日君再來」等歌，鶯聲起處，悠然神往。可是「天下無不散之筵席」這樣的一夕所耗，何止數十金？然而偷生於孤島樂園的準上海人，或臨時入籍的假上海人，却竟樂此而不疲。</p>
<p>這樣浪費揮霍的晚餐，一大半是聲，色，犬，馬，之誘，弄得你神魂顚倒，非踏上酒樓痛飲不可。和早上胡亂塞進些麵包，粢飯糰，或陽春麵等簡陋食品，相去何啻霄壤！雖不能說上海人，是人人如此，至少亦不在少數，吾則酒肆，樓頭，和大餐室裏的沸翻盈大的熱閙，決不是家家有正當事情的正式讌會，可以斷言！</p>
<p>就社會上普通狀况而說：一般公司，行，號，和工廠等工商機關裏，每天晚餐，都是碗盆滿席，有飯，有粥，菜肴豐盛，公館，家庭，也是這樣。只有一般中等人家，吃些焦泡飯，或白粥，佐以花生一碟，或加皮蛋，油筍，明蝦等佐膳，已很覺非常可口，何必夜夜雞，肉，徒恣口福呢？所以筆者每晚回家，一碟菜蔬一碟荳，或一苣，一筍，一鹹蛋，以佐薄粥兩碗，已覺得非常滿足而快樂，彼運簿粥都沒有吃的，才是眞苦！</p>
<h3>人造絲</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>天象　從春末而達到初夏了！我們只要看看那些在街上走路的人們，身上都變換了輕漂的衣服。跟着初夏季節的和風掀蕩着「穿衣者的舒適和快感，這是絲綢的力量。中國人歡喜穿絲綢做的衣服，可是不會使絲綢的製造發展得普遍，更不會使絲綢的價格降低，因此「人迭絲」這寶貝就趁此崛起了，現在，我魷來講講「人造絲」：</p>
<p>「人造絲」在近年來纔交着一步好幸運，但是它出世的時代，却在一九二五年，先起時誰也不注意這東西，認為一人造絲」是一件玩意兒，至多陳列在展覽會裏供人觀賞而已，那知「人造絲」本身有了進步後——就是「人造絲一能平民化，每年的消費，竟超過蠶絲四倍以上呢？</p>
<p>構成人造絲」的原料就是紡織剩餘的破棉花，把棉花的纖維浸在硝酸內，使發生硝化的作用，成功一種硝化織維素，然後溶解在某種溶液中，變成膠體，再經米篩似的細孔流出，就凝固成有光澤的纖維，整理後就造成了所謂人造絲英語呌（Rayon）。</p>
<p>人造絲的用處很廣，和眞絲一樣好做綢綾絹帛這些布品，做衣服穿雖然沒有蠶絲的來得柔軟，却也很挺括，像絲襪，領帶，手巾都可以用「人造絲」來做，價錢此眞絲的便官好幾倍，所以用「人造絲」的人逐漸多了。</p>
<p>最近父有新發明的三種「人造絲一，一種呌「抗水綢」，一種呌「防縐綢」。還有一種呌「防污綢」、眞巧妙，抗水綢」製成的衣服下雨天，好當雨衣穿，水碰到了這「抗水綢」，好似遇見火一般，紛紛的潰退了。「防縐綢」製成的衣服，用不着電氣熨斗燙，把「防縐綢」壓成一小塊，但放開來是件極服貼的衣服，「防汚綢」有一特別之點，牠的表面似乎有一層玻璃遮蓋着一般，穿上身天的衣多好服，祇耍你輕輕抖一下，全部汚穢，立刻被驅逐出境，一掃而空。</p>
<p>「人造棲」在不斷地進步着，將來恐怕也把　絲打倒哩。但是這「人造絲」　出品，全是舶來品，我們應當注意；最好還是穿本國蠶絲所製的綢緞，以挽回我們的利權。</p>
<h3>沙漠上的火車（下）</h3>
<p>— 茶客</p>
<p>不但這個，而還是因了白天關內有其他驢騾牛馬之交通工具，上下往來行走，駱駝若要也在白天行走，在路上便要發生阻碍交通的事情。因為駱駝每每一行，就有幾百或幾千，至少也是幾十的數目，它們要上了這條道往東走，那末，向西來的別種車輛就不能通行了·這是因為它們排成的長蛇陣不易躲閃的原故。</p>
<p>駱駝這種動物，走起來雖不甚快，但却有長久的耐性。它能在風雪交加中，毫不畏懼地整日邁進，這種不怕吃苦的精神，不但他種動物所不及，就是我們最敏感而稱為至上動物的人類，也是不能望其項背</p>
<p>駱駝的行列，是每隔五個必有一個在頸項間帶着一隻大鈴，每隔十個至少必有一人在它背上坐着，最後的一個駱駝，其頸項中必帶着一個特別大而聲音也特別響的鐵鈴。這是拉駱駝的壓陣鈴，也就是說拉駱駝的在晚上跨在駱駝背上，不用操別的心事，只要聽後面的那個大鐵鈴在隨着他響，就不會有岔子發生。</p>
<p>說到這裏，又不能不說一說駱駝這東西是太笨了。俗語說：「蔴繩牽駱駝」，在它們的行列中，每個駱駝都用一根蔴繩由其鼻孔中串着，拴在另一個駱駝的駝架後面。因為那蔴繩是極鬆而目很細的，最容易斷折，繩若一斷，它便就不會再隨着大隊前進而停下來了；所以在最前面必有一人拉着它們前進，故普通呼駝夫曰：一拉駱駝」者。</p>
<p>據說這要用細蔴繩牽它們的原因，是因為駱駝不認生人的原故，若是有什麼小偷或强盜要打刧他們的東西，這駱駝便口噴駝糞，抵抗生人，於是蔴繩即斷，拉駱駝的人聽見鈴聲不對，便司知道是有意外而加以　　了。</p>
<h3>被籠</h3>
<p>— 何立三</p>
<p>被　這名詞：好像很冷僻，究竟是什麼凍西，諒多數讀者，都要莫名其妙。現在讓筆者介紹，來說明一下吧。按「被籠」是浙東諸暨的特產物，用以代步，共物形如喜慶所用之條箱，不過條箱係木製，此是篾或籐所編製而成，作橢圓形，又如小兒睡眠之搖籃，上而多一靠背，把這物放在一木製的架上，用一根很長的扛棒，穿在架的上面，用兩人扛抬，每人還用一根撑棒，行時，前後的扛夫，發出怪聲的呼號，人坐在裏面，宛如坐在牀上一樣，下面用綿被作墊，呌做被籠，大的就是這個意思。這個東西，在該處居戶人家多置備，作為自家人代步，及迎送親友之用。用時，呌兩名長工做扛夫，倘然自己家裏沒有這長工，可到隣家或別處呌喚，工資很隨便，看路途遠近付給，不過要供給膳食。這種旅行器具，外省人很少見過。見了，要深為驚異，因為那種形狀，很不雅觀。現在該縣城廂一帶，已通行人力車，此物幾在天演淘沐之列，但在鄉鎮間，還是盛行着咧！</p>
<p>特別啟事　近日各報投稿者，多自動以稿費移作義賣獻金之用，本刊投稿諸君，有願參加者，請於稿尾註明「義賣獻金」四字，自當照辦。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>捲心菜也是很富於准太命的一種菜蔬，無論葷煮索煮，司說是無往不宜，並且不但在中菜中佔有重要地位，運西餐中也往往要利用它的。素的煮法，以紅燒為最普通，要是煮素十景時，那麼又非用捲心菜不可，其餘甚麼麵筋油條筍片香菌木耳等等，全是輔佐品了。至於葷的煮法，最普通的是與猪肉塊一同紅燜，或與肉片筍片一同白炒，不放醬油，味兒很像菜花炒肉片。還有一種特別煮法，本星期所耍特別介紹的，就是捲心菜包肉，將猪肉和竹筍一齊切細，加了醬油，和在一起，做成餅子，然後把洗凈了的捲心菜嫩葉，一張張句起來，每張包一個肉餅子，做成餃子模樣，一同紅燒，吃起來很是可口。如其愛吃牛肉的，那麼不用猪肉，以牛肉為代，亦無不可。</p>
<p>星期一　捲心菜句肉　雪菜燉黃魚　菠菜燒豆腐　竹筍拌萵苣</p>
<p>星期二　洋葱牛肉絲　糖醋燒鯽魚　油條炒靑菜　淸炒荼豆芽</p>
<p>星期三　乾菜紅燒肉　蝦仁燉雞蛋　豆腐蓬蒿菜　筍衣綫粉湯</p>
<p>星期四　薺菜肉絲羹　醋溜大黃魚　紅燒捲心菜　海蜇蘿蔔絲</p>
<p>星期五　銀芽炒肉絲　銀魚炒雞蛋　油條金芥菜　蝦子炒麵筋</p>
<p>星期六　捲心菜肉片　肉燉鹹鮝魚　豆腐萵苣菜　雪菜黃豆芽</p>
<p>星期日　咖哩肉　蛋花湯　炒薺菜　炒蘿蔔</p>
<h3>住與健康的關係</h3>
<p>— 顧不問</p>
<p>衣食住了，假使缺少「住，」那就沒有安身之地。我們勞勞終日，東西奔走，無非為了衣食；但是沒有安穩的居住，豈不大糟而特糟？目前畸形繁榮，號稱安樂的孤島上，就為了居住問題，大起恐慌。二房東雖藉戰神之威勢，得享意外的利益，非但剝削三房客的脂膏，猶屬事小，却與人生健康上，大大的發生影響，關係甚大。小小的一幢房屋，要住上六七份人家，甚至擱樓灶披，也告客滿。於是屋小人多，空氣體積，不敷需要，更談不到淸潔，或因換氣發生障礙，以致妨害呼吸，或因光綫不足，以致細菌滋生。在此種種狀態之下，難求健康的生活，大害心身的活動。</p>
<p>要知道住宅的大小，與健康很有關係。住宅如不適宜，那就妨害個人淸潔，易使煩悶疲倦，身體衰弱，缺乏抵抗力，因而傳染病更易滋蔓，每有發生肺癆，及其他疾病的可能。同時，居民的死亡率，勢必增高，壽命減退，這都是住宅不良的惡果。</p>
<p>我們要求身體的健康，就非得注意住宅之衛生不可，至少限度，應具有下列幾個標準的參</p>
<p>住宅寬敞</p>
<p>我們在健康上所需的新鮮空氣，大致如下：男子——每人每點鐘——應需三·六〇〇立方英尺。女子——每人每點鐘——應需三·〇〇〇立方英尺。兒童——每人每點鐘——應需二·〇〇〇立方英尺。</p>
<p>混合之家庭——平均每人每點錡——應需二·〇〇〇立方英尺。</p>
<p>由上述數字，可以知道，若要保持正常的呼吸，新鮮的空氣，就非得有寬大的空間不可。所以我們日常所得安身的住宅，也要相當寬敞，方能維持空氣淸潔，而免呼吸障礙，致息疾病之弊。</p>
<p>多開窗戶</p>
<p>西諺云：「日光不到的地方，是醫生常到之處。」可見光綫對於健康，甚為重要。光綫不足的住宅，非但易患近視，且令微菌發育，以致空氣污濁。房屋內光綫的優劣，全恃窗戶之多寡，及其地位而定。如果多開窗戶，旣可流通空氣，又可陽光射入，掃除病菌，所以窗戶之多寡，即可判別住宅之優劣。</p>
<p>起居設備</p>
<p>有了寬敞的房屋，較多的窗戶，倘使起居設備，不合衛生，那也是難符健康的要求。起居應合衛生，睡眠應守時間，至於設備，非求摩登，應需簡單適用己足。常見一般家庭，滿堆雜物，最礙衛生。允以深夜不睡，日午未起，有窗皆閉，無室不垢，雖居於寬敞的房屋，未免與健康之道，相差太遠。</p>
<p>環境優良</p>
<p>接近工廠的住宅，或在嘈雜的馬路旁邊，那就終日受着烟煤塵屑，呌囂雜沓的煩困。此種噴出的烟煤，每含有二氧化碳，亞硫酸等有害物質，為害人體，甚非淺鮮。外加軍馬嘈雜，整夜不安，因此心身　受莫大損害。假使遇着兇狠的二房東，不倫不類的高鄰，那就在精神上，遭受莫大痛苦。所以住的環境，亦應格外選擇，愼之又愼。</p>

<h3>外滙期貨需要不衰</h3>
<p>套利者扖近塞遠</p>
<p>猛緊後卒告回平</p>
<p>滙市咋以油洋行德士古曁其他各大洋行等扒興仍濃、兼華行與華商投機家及外銀行亦競相猛扒、且英美等各大銀行對於現貨、尚有照維特價供塞、而期貨供意、似稍形淡薄、雖港電與西商沙遜一度拋塞、但仍感不敷分配是以過程一度猛緊、英金八月份曾一度緊至七便士九三七五、美匯亦會軟至十五元四三七五、後因引起套利者之興趣、價遂轉平、照目前掉期、英金按月須〇六二五、現貨與八月差縮達二五、美金每月緊一二五、現貨至八月差達半元、計按月利息、除佣為七厘半光景、半天交易現貨平淡、期貨較旺、至港滙因雙方供求勢勻、結果亦平、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期續漲一二五、速期升〇六二五、紐的銀價呆定如故、倫敦生金亦仍呆定、滙兌英對美大一厘三、對滬仍平、對法長三生丁、美對英昂〇六二五、對滬小六分、對法未更、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價英滙八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、較之前牧均平、開後　華行與各大洋行互相扒結英金、但以英行匯豐尚肯供塞、致鮮變化、計華行及洋行結進匯豐現貨英金八便士二五、繼之洋行又購結大通某行現貨美匯十六元〇六二五、潛勢亦鮮變化、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉續大七厘半、計徵百分之六·七五、此後現貨交易轉寂、期貨則頗形熱閙、計外行華比·荷蘭·突吸購港電本月份英金八便士一八七五、俄而外行華比轉手即回吐予華行六月份英金八便士一二五、（合奕月息、除佣七厘半）後油洋行德士古亦扒結某行本月份美匯十五元九三七五、此後東方匯理銀行亦購結西商沙遜七月份英金八便士〇六二五、繼之洋行與華商相　結進外銀行界八月份美滙十五元五六二五、其時扒結者仍想購結、但以供源不旺、致潛勢一度帶緊、計英金八月份曾緊達七便士九三七五、美匯亦會軟至十五元四三七五、後因引起套利者之與趣、稍來吐售期貨英美兩金、故局勢回半、將近午時、外行荷蘭安達頻吐港匯、賣予錢兌業現貨港匯五十五元半與六二五、為狀平穩、迨午收銀行現貨賣價英匯八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、港匯五十五元六二五、結果較之隔昨晚收、英美港三滙、均無榮辱、午後週三無市</p>
<h3>證券　外債繼續上騰</h3>
<p>上海公債買賣、因五三國恥紀念停市、倫敦中國外債本月二日（星期二）掛牌行市、續見上升、英德續借款英發債票續升一鎊、價為六十七鎊、市利斯浦公債上升牛鎊、價為三十七鎊、隴海鐵路公債有印債票續升半鎊、價為十八鎊半、其餘則告平定、英倫實貨求售、計善後借款法發有印債票二千鎊、售價五十鎊五先令、照英發撳落十五先令、費克斯飛機借款債票二千鎊、售價十八鎊、照市抬十五先令、馬可尼無錢電借款債票一千五百鎊、售價十八鎊半、比費克斯行市抬一鎊五先令、湖廣鐵路公債德發有印債票五千鎊、售價二十一鎊、照市抬半鎊</p>
<p>上海衆業公所股票市面淸淡、惟有耶松股堅高至一百零二元、及瑞鎔普通股上漲至七元二角、吸胃暢旺、公共汽車股見廿八元之新高價、怡和股前數日頗形堅挺、而今日（三日）稍形回軟、收盤時買價為十八元七角、倫敦及紐的橡皮原料價格上漲、但橡皮股市似仍呆滯、　倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月二日（星期二）掛牌行市、稍有上落、麥加利銀行股上升二先令六辨士、價為七鎊十七先令六辨士、開平煤礦不記名股續升三辨士、價為十七先令六辨士、朝鮮礦務股跌落六辨士價為五先令六辨士、其餘均無變動、</p>
<h3>五金　黑鐵坯子　到銷俱旺</h3>
<p>黑織坯子前因貨少、客幫需求爽健、致市貨被搜一空、最近新貨　絡經有到、但津幫及木街熱水瓶由戧等廠紛紛在辦、市貨大有隨到隨銷之勢、行情二百磅貨每箱三十元、二千磅貨每箱（二百磅計算）售三十二元、均比翁市好起一元、昨開出二白餘箱、但現貨益覺淺簿、人心奇好、對於來市喊價勢看續高、查海外新貨如　百傍貨每噸定四十五金元、二千磅貨每噸定五十金元、且無近期現貨云、</p>
<h3>紗花　風狂雨暴中之紗布</h3>
<p>實銷不動：祇賴同行皮球交易</p>
<p>籌碼感多：售價跌落十元左右</p>
<p>日紗空戶：聞有數家被擠擱淺</p>
<p>近來棉紗市　、波浪洶湧、猶如在風暴雨之勢、實則連朝上漲以後、客銷寥然不動、於是買來賣去、一時籌碼稍感過剩、市盤即猛跌、然價業時買戶又來活動價則從速上騰、此種顚簸不定之局、完全係投機者所操縱、繞之價格在高峯時、使人迷昏無方針可行大有混沌之象、午後虛風陡起、因浮多吐出、實銷不來之故也、查昨紗價高低差額都有十元以外、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤市况尚穩定、且大都在多頭地位、故對於市面均有一致看好之勢、因此往往開盤高時為多、二十支雙馬現紗價仍做叫百叫十元、棧單價為四百三十元、與上日無甚軒輊、但係同行成交十包、旋以質需依然寥寥而勿動、市盤步開步挫、做到四百三十五元、棧單價為四百二十五元、比開盤價跌五元、嗣以價鬆後多方復來活動、收　且時達十一時左右、買風稍熾、立刻回升二三元、父做到四百三十八九元、棧單價做至四白二十八九元至三十元、查其市塲成交狀况、都係同行皮球交易、午後開盤市象已帶呆木、勉强開小一元、少頃賣者業集、喊賣堅驟盛、形勢突見虛弱、一霎時跌去五六元、現紗價為四百三十一元、棧單價為四百二十二元、天女棧單僅跌主四百二十元、據市塲傳言、謂某某等做作、故意賣出撳小、不過現銷不動也、結果各幫買去統計一千三百六十三包、行情二十支雙馬天女兩牌跌七八元、牧羊跌十二元、雙地球跌八元半、其餘中身紗均跌四五六元不等、昨由香港運來紗三十件、今日出口尚有棉紗六百五十五件運天津、又五百六十五件運汕頭、又二十二件運泉州、又十一件運厦門、又五百四十五件運香港、茲將各幫買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一、〇五〇　內地一二五</p>
<p>香港　七八　汕頭　一〇</p>
<p>江西　一五　四川　八五</p>
<p>統計　一、三六三</p>
<p>連朝飛騰之日紗市面、忽受打擊、茲據市塲言、近以狂漲過度、其中拋空者被擠耗虧不貲、鍳於在此環境之下、勢　支持、業有數家因週轉不靈擱淺矣、故一味抬高市價、結果賺了錢亦有拿不到手之苦咋市價之變遷、殊堪驚人、晨初續升五元、午跌十元、下午突然狂　、當日高低價要相差二十元、查其原因、有許多人專聽靑島交易所中之行市做比例、而作標準、因此波浪滔天、二十支月琴上午最高價會追四百元、下午收盤價僅為三百八十元、一跌二十元、此種情形、發財者有之、失收者有之亦所當然耳、</p>
<h3>美棉田估計增加　印棉續訂萬餘包</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市開盤略漲二三磅昔、各同業及現貨商以七十月份棉價拔開殊闊、新花價廉、故紛紛將近期了結、掉進遠期、政府出口津貼問題未決、使大衆觀望、據南方議員施密斯表示、彼等認出口津貼問題將成懸案、彼將召集各南方議員共討應付反對出口津貼之策、昨日紐的發特出版公司估計本年棉田共二七、一九七、〇〇〇畝、較之上决之估計增百分之四、昨日紐的近期跌一至六磅音、遠期漲五至七磅音、印棉運同預測跌一羅比、埃及停市、棉價折合法幣計美棉及巴西棉及印棉每担跌四角餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來尚稱熱閙、昨日各方訂購印棉總共的萬餘包、內華廠方面佔四千包、英日廠為七千餘包、各日廠存底異常稀薄、竟有即將告罊之勢、運日來在市搜購現貨頗烈、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠錄下、</p>
<p>原料　類別　送廠連稅</p>
<p>六十支埃及棉高級　一〇四·二五</p>

<p>三十二　四十二支美種彭加浦　八九·二五</p>
<p>本棉生意轉人沉悶之途、而廠胃完全閉塞、因之市熊益呈簫索、惟同業有兩筆印棉交易、市價稍昂、因印棉塊角提漲、本埠現貨售價亦隨之上升、蘇北到通州花四百〇八包、今日有棉花三千件運汕頭、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白暴騰益烈</h3>
<p>產地再度收回期貨</p>
<p>昨荷組白因產地又有收回七八月份、價為荷幣九·七〇、而太古糖港方亦停售不出、故市氣愈形激昂、再度暴漲元許、公會劃盤、二叫組白外棧現貨升至二十八元七角、本棧二十八元八角、後更呌至廿九元二角、轉口貨初市劃二十元四角、漸高至零八角、成交一千三百包、倚赤亦升半元、現貨十八元半、轉口十三元、本綿白跟升一元、振記一號二十八元半、二號二十八元、三號二十七元半、四號二十七元、太古車白B嘜現貨西棧二十八元四角、OW嘜二十八元二角、OX嘜二十八元、DY嘜二十七元八角、HX嘜二十七元七角、H嘜車赤十八元半、國糖以汕頭來源、防有阻碍、亦在上漲中、提莊靑十六元二角、尚未成交、正綿赤十六元丸角至八角、開出三四百包、冲提靑數十包、十五元七角、廣帮開出大簍片靑三百件、升一元、為十一元、建帮開出刁靑百五十包、十四元二角、潮帮亦開五百包、十四元半、</p>
<p>三日自香港來糖一千九百包、厦門來一千六百四十包、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉價看好</h3>
<p>廠盤比洋麥為高　大批澳麥將進口</p>
<p>廠粉　本廠現粉市况、仍趨擊俏、二號粉廠　自經連日提漲至四元四角五分現鈔後、廠方尚欲提高、並無相常供給、推其原因、皆山於國外產價頻升、且一華興銀行」成立聲中、物價看高、人心與市面一致向上、惟北　帮實銷亦已减退、蓋目下匯水上落太巨、均不敢多負重大風險、即前兩日所辦之貨、亦大都心思作用、故新交易頓見减縮、南洋帮亦祗零星點綴而已、統市成交三萬包左右、市面或有一度擯持云、</p>
<p>洋粉　續告平靜、查脫立體別司船所到之貨、均係蝙蝠狐狸及雙應等脾、市上尚鮮供、應、蓋目下國外產價頻升、及裝船兵險等費用加增、成本益見高昂、是以貨方不肯輕易脫手、目下洋粉市價為四元四角至三角半現鈔、但無整額成交、蓋本廠粉雖比洋粉為高、而出貨期限可以寬放、故客方莫不注意購辦廠粉、致洋粉銷塲無形中稍受打　云、</p>
<p>洋麥　澳麥又有來滬、怡和洋行經理之King　Winian號輸、自澳洲裝來麥子九萬二千零十一包、計七千七百十三噸、該麥係四川路立基洋行經　、今日可抵滬、巳預定停泊十一·十二號浮筒起卸云、</p>
<p>出口　今有麵粉一萬包運天津、一萬四千二百包運厦門、二萬二千九百包運泉州、又有麩皮二百包運泉州、父五百包運厦門、</p>
<h3>謂是來源受阻　米價衝出限盤　客秈洋米帶好</h3>
<p>國米　來源受內地多方被阻後、滬埠到貨日少、適值棧貨湧出、致存底感薄、本街店胃及囤戶大事採佈、日河下貨仍到一號、車輪包子亦僅一千四五百包、故貨主心思扳俏允烈、因是售價竞術出十四元限盤、結果厚薄粳價昂至十四元半、較前已升三角至五角、杜洋尖埠尖市亦跟好、變元因缺貨竟開十九元半、總之此種市面、全由各路來源影響、及內地糙價厚粳已在十二元五六角、而薄稻亦已十二元左右、</p>
<p>客秈　昨有大戶客囤吸收、且以市上謠言極盛、粳尖飛漲、客秈來源雖日有五六千包、而貨方因成本高昂、故售價步提、京蕪秈一律昂至十三元七八角、比前市激漲五六角、成交數亦加至七八千包之鉅、</p>
<p>洋米　昨被本客秈帶好、本街零整需要突旺、西貢米開出一千四五百包、價十七元八角、比前市昂二三角云、</p>
<h3>海味　生粉產價昂騰</h3>
<p>生粉近據荷訊、高貨暴漲、划之申價、有升至二元以上者、如昨日開出二四標一批（前市售十四元）、成　為十六元五角、其他各標亦隨呌價、刻人鎗標二十二元、飛麒騎十九元、三X十八元五角、KG十七元五角、三T十三元五角、其勢挺秀、</p>
<h3>藥材　厦門梔子見新</h3>
<p>厦門槴子新貨業已登塲、最近有販戶運到一批、身份尚不乾足、隨卽售於行家、其價較陳貨的別低五六</p>

<h3>絲茶　絲經外銷大振</h3>
<p>紐約絲巿軋現　由於綢廠囤購</p>
<p>國外絲市、漲風在熾、紐的日絲現貨、各漲二分、近期漲四分、遠期漲八分、橫濱現貨開出一二三〇兀、漲廿元、遠期漲三十元、據傳紐的絲市軋現情形、尚不完全由於投機、乃小規模綢織廠之羣起吸購、此點原因、則於美國現行政策、有强調抵貨運動有關也、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、昨外銷大振、白廠經七八分自一八〇〇元、售至一八三〇元、計怡和·達昌。連納。等共進二百五十担、輯里經六個號子麒麟跑馬等級、仁記·達昌等計進二百十担、廠商絲客之討價至下午計漲起五十元許、故今日絲價、當可續昂、四日有十六件縣經、運香港、又三日有茶葉一千零二十六件、自香港來、</p>
<h3>油餅　業內外囤購　現豆油</h3>
<p>生油轉自港厦運來</p>
<p>生油、明平暗定、蓋因近日來源雖有、但為時令及環境關係、各種物價、日見提漲、故生油銷塲　暗中頗呈活絡、昨市膠州油一星期交貨開三十八元、成交二百餘件、</p>
<p>三日有生油自香港來四百件、自厦門來五百件、</p>
<p>豆油潛勢更在看漲、因期油已告段落將後來源、必受龔斷、以致業內外一般有資力之投機家、又在購國現貨、故市價步高、昨市做開膠州豆油一百件、價為三十三元五角、烟岐豆油一百五十件、三十四元二角及三十四元、連岐大簍五十件、四十四元五角、大運現油三百餘桶、價自四十六元三角半步升至四十六元五角半、</p>
<h3>連餅無甚變化　期貨交易居多</h3>
<p>豆餅交易、昨祇大運餅有市、近來市况、尚無重大變化、蓋因內地銷塲、被肥田粉侵奪、以致現餅銷滯、市塲中大都是期貨心思交易、行情在一二分之間徘徊、昨成交雜牌現餅二千片、價為二元九角二分、比上日市升一分、期餅五月份雜牌、開二元九角四分半、源記為二元九角半、共成交二千片、六月份雜牌開三元零四分半、源記自三元零八分至零七分、共成交五千片、</p>
<p>豆子進口、三日自天津來九百八十四包、又四日出口則有二百八十包運泉州、三百包運香港、五十包運香港、又三日復有棉子油五千件、自天津來、</p>

<p>海防增建倉庫　去貨當可旺盛</p>
<p>布國</p>

<p>東布</p>
<p>細布·細斜晨跌午回、市氣轉平、十二磅龍頭陽鶴等牌細布上午低盤售開十叫元六角左右、下午父升漲至十四兀八九角、期貨為十五元一角半、較前日市價降一角、細斜亦續挫角許、陽鶴現貨每疋十三元九角、藍以業外囤戶不來拉提、同業與客帮實銷有限、全日成交亦僅千件之譜、行方無開貨、本街辦進七八百件、北帮進三百餘件、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>四月份反攻的成績</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>前幾天，倫敦的軍事觀察家，就有道樣的話：華軍在這時反攻廣州並商昌，予以克復，是否為聰明的舉動，很成疑問。他們的意思，很容易使人明白：這時的華軍，還不必舉行反攻，更不必說總反攻，以很大的代價，來克復一城一鎮；這樣的克復，是得不償失的。</p>
<p>現在，我們第一次大規模的反攻，已經隨着四月份的過去，而暫告一段落了。我們檢討倫敦軍事觀察家的意見，覺得牠的確有相當的理由，也正和我們一般入的育見差不多：相機反攻是必要的，但並不一定要佔領任何城市。因此，四月份的反攻，雖然沒有永久克復廣州或南昌，而反攻的作用，卻完全實現了出來。</p>
<p>我軍反攻廣州，使對方進攻西江以取廣四的企圖，寫之失墜；反攻南昌，使他們攻取長沙的迷夢，為之粉碎；反攻漢水東岸，使他們渡越　水以窺沙市宜昌的妄想，為之放棄。這些都是彰彰在人耳目的事實，用不着什麼粉飾的。假使沒有這些反攻，那宋對方獨佔主動地位，伺隙而動，我們防不勝防，恐怕雙方的陣綫，又已移西若干距離了吧。</p>
<p>於此，可見我軍的反攻是必要的，不過不必陘膠柱鼓瑟，專爭一地的得失，破壞全盤的抗戰計劃。於此，叉可見我軍的確有反攻的力量，一旦時機成熟，就可以以破竹之勢，席捲而下，收復所有的失地。於此，更可見對方的實力，的確有限，我們終有向之予取予求的一日。</p>
<p>在我軍反攻之前，有許多人在迫切地期望著反攻：反攻不發動，他們便有些失望。在反攻的進行中，又有許人在熱烈地期待着勝利；勝利不續續血來，他們又有些失望。在現在，反攻告一段落之後，我相信一定還有許多人在不息地等候着另外的反攻；反攻的再度遲遲出現，他們仍不免於失望，或者甚至懊喪。我要對他們說：他們的熱心是可嘉的：他們的失望或灰心，是不必要的！我們有明確的計劃；我們有必然的勝利！</p>
<p>四月份的反攻，正可以作為由防禦而入於完全反攻的過渡階段，在全部抗戰過程上為重要的一環，其價值的重要，不言可喻。我們為了要獲取以後的勝利，所以我們耍珍視這四月份的反攻，認為我們的初步成功！</p>
<h3>蘇聯女飛行家（下）</h3>
<p>— 保麗娜。奧雪朋哥作　何言譯自莫斯科新聞</p>
<p>我深切的請求着校長，我決定我要做一個飛行家！我要保衛國家決不輸於其他男子們！校長微笑了，他提議可受體格測驗，醫生們都說我合格。</p>
<p>如此以後，我是航空學校裏的學生，我有一套制服和宿舍中的一閒房間。</p>
<p>我現在不想告訴你開始時候的困難，我披閱書籍早上中午一直到晚上，慾望是這樣的大，我想做一個有學問的飛行家，我吝惜著讀書以外的每一分鐘。</p>
<p>同時我眼見着許多飛行家，和我以前不能想像得到的事情。我會見一架驅逐機火箭般的在空中飛翔，一會兒向右，　一會兒向左，旋轉著機身，翻着斛斗，飛出環形的花樣，這頭　甲蟲的機器在空中希奇的服從着，在精密的計算之下做着奇異的表演，他像鷯為一樣的沉默，燕子一樣的不可捉摸，在烏克蘭的上空翱翔着。</p>
<p>飛機一架跟一架的降落，我注視着這些從機廂中出來一個飛行家的面龐，他們是超人的，有着不可信的盎巾的技藝</p>
<p>他，駕駛那驅逐機的，在許多人中間，他的面龐，他的步伐，他的微笑，那一件又和常人不同了呢？我想，他的故事也不外從一個工廠或一個集合農場，青年共產黨同盟，走進航空學校的。</p>
<p>他開始單獨飛行，也在我以前不久，學　們不多講他們第一次飛行的，不久這　輪到我了。</p>
<p>一天，我和教師演習回來，我做着個很不行的降落，那時我真夢想不到就要單獨飛行了，我的教師一句也不講到我降落的不行，他卻回顛來問我是否疲倦。</p>
<p>「不。」我說。</p>
<p>「好，你可以來一個單獨飛行了。」</p>
<p>快樂和突然使我幾乎不敢呼吸，但我並不背棄我的　覺</p>
<p>「很好，教師。」我　　　靜的回答。</p>
<p>我升上去了，我　不　　記這一忽兒，我一個人在空中，教師在地面上，我是單獨飛行了。我做着滿意的降落，我再二次升空，每樣事都好好地進行着，這樣就開始我的單獨飛。。</p>
<p>但，我還有很長路走，我決定我自己要成一個成功的飛行家。</p>
<p>一九三二年年底，我在航空學校裹畢業了，我被送進去學習做一個軍事航空家。</p>
<p>不久我被任為小隊長，我的工作成紱顯然有着長足的進步，除了主要工作之外，我還做着許多社會上的事情，幫我丈夫讀書和工作。我繼續努力，我學會了開，同時我注重我的教育，我在勞工　修學校畢業，我預備再進軍事航空學校。我飛行了六年，不會發生一件事，甚至被迫降落的事也沒有。　　　　。　　　　、</p>
<p>當我有足夠的自信，我請求我的司命允許我作一次長距離的飛行，他想了一會說道：</p>
<p>「我忠告你預先作一次最高度飛行，你答應嗎？」</p>
<p>我同意了。</p>
<p>在一九三六年九月，司今呌我去，對我說可以做一次最高度飛行，測驗飛機的最高度</p>
<p>我駕着「逢達」號水上滑走機，我在三萬呎的高空，停留了十九分鐘。飛機還可以升得更高，但我不敢到他的極限，當我降落下來，司令官嘉根向我祝賀。</p>
<p>「你已飛得比全世界的女人更高了。」他說。</p>
<p>我的丈夫，也是個小隊長，他也飛到很大的高度，但我卻超過了他，超過了我們以團體裏每一個人。在這一個練習中，我到二萬三千呎，還沒有用氧氣裝備。</p>
<p>一九三八年五月裏，我和我的隊員佛蘭·洛馬林娜，蘭斯科伐作不停止的長距離飛行，創立了一個國際婦女長距離飛行的記錄，用我們的水上機環飛，我們飛了一千零九十三哩。</p>
<p>在一九三八年七月二日，我們再來一次不停止的飛行，從塞巴斯拖保到阿堪遮，在十小時三十三分鐘經過了一千七百零七哩。</p>
<p>這些都記錄在航空遊戲委員會中，造成了二次全蘇聯婦女飛行的記錄，直綫飛行和曲綫飛行。</p>
<p>受了列寧的命令和政府的獎勵，洛馬哥和我都得了隊長的階級，蘭斯科伐也　升為副隊長。</p>
<p>我決不為的了榮譽而休息，我將繼續努力，飛得更高的高度和更長的距離！（完）</p>

<h3>五四運動在今天</h3>
<p>— 任一</p>
<p>二十年前的今天，北平的青年學生，會經把他們的血蹟，寫下了一頁尤榮的歷史。－－五四運動的意義和價值，可以說是「二一十世紀的東方文藝復興」的　機。</p>
<p>在今天，值得孰們來個重新的估計，就歷史發展法即而言：紀念五四運動，並不是希望有着重複的寫法；相反的，是揚棄了過去的舊的一切，而演變出嶄新的東西。常年的五四運動是：一，打鑰倒辱國的條約和賣國賊。二，建立反封建的新文化的基礎。如今呢，要配合著時代的需求，必然要更有力的完成了新的使命：</p>
<p>一，蔣委員長說：「中途妥協，就是滅亡。」為着民族的生存，獨立，目由，這次　動神聖的抗職；我們要絕對堅決的遵守「國家至上，民族至上；軍事第一，勝利第一：意志集中，力量集中」的三大原則，有着「抗戰必勝，建國必成」的信念。二，對於任何賣國的歪曲理論，我們要處處戒備，時時提防，更要無情的揭破它，打擊它，消滅它，因為樅容了就等於屈服侵略者。這裏，特別要整飭我們青年舉生的隊伍，來擔負民族前衛的重任。</p>
<p>三，此外，「我們不但要抗戰，我們還要建國。」在爭取最後勝利的目標下，我們應當充實自己的生活，鍛煉自己的體魄，糾正自己的思想，不消極，不落伍，不反動：把一切貢獻給國家，鼓起大　畏的精神，努力於民族解放　爭的大業。</p>
<p>朋友們！不要辜負我們的今天，寫一頁更光榮的歷史吧！（義賣戲金）</p>
<h3>今天的紀念</h3>
<p>— 電長</p>
<p>今天，五四，是「青年節」。他是一個偉大的中國民族反侵略反封建的新興運動：作為推進新文化運動的前鋒，奠定了新文化的基石。這裏，中國的青年首先以新的尖銳的戰　姿態出現着。</p>
<p>正是歐戰剛了，國際　　着　混亂的狀態，半殖民地的中國就有着抬的　會；但為了不會認清列強間的矛盾，把時機好好把握着，遂致在巴黎由會中　　下來，而遠　　　　帝國利用地位的優越，卻　　　　　地進逼着，給予中國　　階級一個很強烈的　　；他們感到了封建政府的庸弱，在「外爭國權，內　國賊」的　　之下，　列地爭　着，北洋軍閥終於不得已，把喪權辱國的賣國賊辦了。然而在華盛頓會　中，「國權」卻依然沒有獲得國外交史上最慘痛的一頁。</p>
<p>而在另一方面，也顯見中國新與層的沒有長足，　未能深深地透入廣大的下屬，結成堅強的戰線來對外；而封建勢力的盡其頑固的反叛作用，卻正反映了新溫和運動推進得不夠－－他底「啓蒙」袛及於少數，大眾還未給有機地聯繫着，意志力量沒有整個集中，那是多麼可惜的事。</p>
<p>德　克拉西（民主）先生袛套上處偽的外衣，為　發揮積極的作用；而賽囚絲（科學）顧念底要使社會生產手段　動的任務的不會完成，正是半殖民地的厄運，在那個時候。</p>
<p>五四的新文化於東是承繼辛亥革命的，要在觀念形態上徹底地來個奧伏　變，適應新與層的薄弱的經濟基礎。他固然有着發揚蹈　逢勃一時的氣象，但以後的難以為　，正由着他底客觀條件。這裏，我們必須要嚴正地歷史地來批判着。</p>
<p>在今天，正是五四運動的二十週紀念日，而偉大的互古未有的民族抗戰已持續了二十餘月，距最後勝利之期正復不遠。我們　　過去，抓住現在，心底正有無限之悲壯和欣悅：五四運動所留下的歷史的使命要在這個時候迅速地完成了。</p>
<p>自然，歷史是辦證地行進着的：國際間的形勢早已和以前不同，誰為吾之衣卻吾之　，正須分明地認清；中國靠着自己堅強地挺立了起來，而主動地爭取國際的友情，在外交上正是最迫切的要務：真正的與邦清到這裏來（還有一個在以前歷史上所未有的，更應注意。）不懷好意的不必來，幫兇的快滾開！我們要更　　地「內懲國賊」，在千鈞一髮的抗戰　　的過歷史免蹈以前的覆轍，再也不能輕饒　歷史的微菌，我們要承繼和擴大反國賊反封建運動。</p>
<p>這裏，要提到的：新的啓蒙運動，在「八一三」以前早已指出，現在在抗戰　　的過程中，付諸實踐有着更廣大的發展，他與抗戰和建國已不能分離，早連結在一起了。　水　五四　的啓蒙運動，給予大眾一種精神上的解放：掃除愚昧的傳統觀念；強固　　的民族意識；普及新興的科學思想；擁護真正的民主政治。惟有他才華固了偉大的民族統一戰線，確定了抗戰的最後勝利；他且能更進一步作為建設獨立自由平等的新中國的精神基礎。</p>
<p>目前，蔣委員長底提出國民精神總動員綱領，那是更具體地武裝了國民　思想，使之配合抗戰；為要達到這一致的目標，則更擴大地推進新啓蒙運動　與之　行，在現在正是最大的任務之一。</p>
<p>我們再來重複一句：五四運動所留下的歷史的使命要在現階段迅速地完成了。（義賣獻金）</p>

<h3>王又宸死後托兆記（上）</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>偶聽無綫電中播王又宸碰碑唱片。因想起又宸去年死後托兆於我一事，久欲寫出，以告戲迷同志，苦於嫵暇，而此事常常縈繞腦際，語云:「一死一生乃見交情］.吾輿又宸相識最早，彼之入夢也，是魂兮歸來，抑吾偶然之夢想，皆不可知。然相交二十餘年月，從來求入吾夢，及共死後半月，吾即夢之，且　子焉，是必有故，不可不記共本末，及吾二人結交之經過，即作　之悼之哭之可也。</p>
<p>民國初年又宸以票友資格，下海不久，在滬某台演唱，（似丹桂第一台）頗受佳譽，同鄉陳子良君（亦戲劇同志，此君已早死）同聽又宸戲畢，約往訪之，相談之下，又宸云:［我們是同鄉，亦徐州祖箱，祖墳在蒲縣，　宛平二世矣.本姓劉，繼舅氏姓王也」。(後於北平識劉鐵夫君，即其胞兄，彼手足不和）此為訂交之始，此後數年，在滬中常見，而交未深也。民十左右，又宸演於亦舞台，唱捉放曹宿店，唱詞大錯，前後顛倒，幾不能終場，（奏琴者徐蘭沅）見余在台下看戲，命跟包者約余至其迎春坊寓所，託為疏通報界，及票界，交情漸深，常共研究腔調字眼。其續娶夫人即譚鑫培之女，通稱老姑娘者，老姑娘身材不高，善言語，主張余與又宸結金蘭之好，遂以兄弟相稱，實未有盟帖也。</p>
<p>又宸在亦舞台唱打漁殺家，脊椎骨跌出寸餘，痛甚，不能登台，問醫於我，我　北派推拿專家亦武術家米劍華先生為之推洽，數日能上台，旬餘平復。又宸壯年得意，民國二三年間，貪組織共和中舞台，自為台主，(共後改名亦舞台，即今新惠中原址）三十至四十歲十年中，極為得意.其時老譚死後，又宸以女婿資格，欲直接譚派正統，文武塲面以及檢塲人完全用老譚所用者.（打鼓人劉順拉　人徐蘭沅餘不記其名）。七年冬又宸返平，在慶樂園第一曰唱空城計，余在台下聽戲所見，(唱至下南陽板槽不穩非本文不詳述），當時言菊朋未下海，馬連良就在富連成效力，余叔岩嗓音未恢複，在浙慈會館玩票，高慶奎尚在做硬裹子，譚富英坐科未滿，故又宸頗能風靡一時焉。彼在上海亦舞台演唱最久，諸葛亮招親為此時出品，又宸飾少年無鬢之諸葛亮，又扮花旦演紡棉花，唱各種小調，開京角老生自排新戲之端，反串花且，亦自又宸始也。</p>
<h3>棄兒·母歸·第五號病室　三個義賣的戲</h3>
<p>— 獨水</p>
<p>徵募難民教育基金　［愛國」女兒也起來了</p>
<p>初夏的風拂過了姑娘們額角上的汗粒，星期六的下午二點鐘，寧波同鄉會的禮　，披了件挨業的衣裳。愛國女中的遊藝會開幕了。</p>
<p>手風琴表演和踢躂，是三個短劇的插曲。</p>
<p>「棄兒」最早演出，這是一幅現實的風景　，寫收容所裹幾個換着淒風苦雨的婦女，內中一個因了沒有力量養活自己的孩子，而把骨肉生生地拆散了。「母歸」則是似反封建的獨幕劇，它把女人守寡改嫁兩個絕對極端的問題交給了觀眾，一個兒子因了母親的私奔，離棄，十年以後竟堅決地拒絕了已經落魄愧悔歸來的母親底歸來，甚至她要求他喊一聲媽媽也不答應。「第五號病室］是三幕劇，它不週是一個暴露社會醜惡片斷的戀愛悲劇，這三個戲由徐立黎放胡導三位先生所導演，而後二戲則是才成立不久的「愛國劇社」擔任排演。</p>
<p>在劇本上，［母歸］是寫得比較成功的，全剝除了開頭一小段稍感　懈以外，從母親出場一直到戲的結束.許各對白都能緊緊把握住劇中人物的情盛空氣，［第五號室］則滲入了許多風趣的成份。［棄兒」的描寫似乎軟弱一點，意識上並不模糊，但技巧上則　不夠。</p>
<p>演出方面，值得一提的是「母歸」中飾母親的一角，她的戲演得很逼真，［第五號病室裏的妹妹也很親切，其餘大致都不算壞特別是化裝方面更好</p>
<p>業餘的戲劇者當然不會有盡善盡美的成績，像難民手指上的鑽石戒，病室裏安神藥水之由來都是應該注意到的，效果方面像門外汽車的喇叭，鄰室病人的呻吟聲也應該加以改進，在［棄兒」中導演的處理不能算好，它失去了控制高潮的力量，當孩子進門時即不喊媽也不撲上去，走的時候也默不作聲，目然戲要　軟多了。</p>
<p>另外值得一提的，在戲場上，消費合作社會舉行義賣，成績很不壞。出來，天色罩上了夜幕。</p>

<h3>Major Defeat of Japanese Troops on the East Bank of the Han River: Chinese Troops Crossed the River in Two Routes at Dawn Yesterday to Launch an Attack, Recapturing Important Strongholds Such as Luohan Temple and Duobao Bay, Advancing Towards Nanchang, Chinese Troops Captured Zhanggong Ferry</h3>
<p>(Yichang) The Japanese troops in the Luohan Temple area on the east bank of the Han River bombarded Shayang, the Chinese side, with heavy artillery all day on the 2nd, and fired a large number of sneeze-inducing gas bombs at the Chinese side. The Chinese army calmly fought back and always held their original positions. Before dawn on the 3rd, the Chinese army in Shayang rose up with a roar and crossed the river in two routes to launch an attack. The Japanese troops on the east bank were panic-stricken and collapsed without resistance. The Chinese army first occupied the two important strongholds of Luohan Temple and Duobao Bay, and took the opportunity to pursue the Japanese troops in Jianhua in three routes towards Tuochuan Pier, Yonglong River, and Yangjia Position. At the same time, the Chinese army also crossed the river from ports such as Sigang City and Cunliudu with powerful troops to attack the Japanese army, and has cleared the Japanese troops in front of them, advancing towards Yuqi River. The large Chinese army along the Han River has all been dispatched to pursue the defeated Japanese troops on the east bank. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde. A telephone from Shashi reports that the Japanese troops in Luohan Temple and other places in central Hubei have recently been restless, attempting to invade Hexi. The Chinese defense artillery, in coordination with the infantry, met the attack with great power. The shells fired all hit the target, repeatedly destroying Japanese positions. On the morning of the 3rd, Luohan Temple and Sigang were successively recaptured by certain divisions of the Chinese army that crossed the river to attack. The remaining Japanese troops are now retreating towards the Yonglong River, and the Chinese army is in pursuit. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yichang) At dawn on the 3rd, the Chinese army crossed the Xiang River and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in Duoshi Bay, Luohan Temple Street, and Sigang City. All were defeated by the Chinese army, and the three key points south of the Hanyi Road were completely recovered. At the same time, the Chinese army pursued the Japanese troops. One route has reached Yangjia River, one route has reached Guanyin Lake and Yuxin River, and one route has reached Sanhechang (all west of Tianmen). The Chinese vanguard troops have won, and the follow-up troops also crossed the river on the 3rd at noon and are now continuing to advance. The situation in central Hubei is threatened by the Chinese army's attack, and the Japanese offensive north of Ying Mountain and Zhongxiang has been thwarted. The focus of the war has shifted south. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin. A certain route of the Chinese army advancing towards Nanchang recaptured Zhanggong Ferry on the night of the 2nd and continued to advance. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) On the Hunan-Hubei border, Chinese and Japanese troops were still engaged in fierce fighting near Nanlin Bridge on the 2nd. Tongcheng North Xiangfeng Temple and Dashaping were recaptured, and the Chinese army is pursuing the remaining Japanese troops. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese war reports, the battles in central Hubei are currently taking place east of Suixian County and west of Wusheng Pass on the Pinghan Railway. Japanese troops on the east bank of the Yi River launched an offensive in two routes towards the northwest on May 1, and occupied Sunjiazhai and Jiulizhai northeast of Suixian County. At the same time, battles are continuing at various ferries on the Han River. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Captures Macheng, Advances Westward</h3>
<p>Xuan City. A certain Chinese army drove out the Japanese troops in Macheng on the 30th and recaptured Macheng. At 4:00 PM on the 1st, the Chinese army also recaptured Zhongguan Post (southwest of Macheng) and is now attacking Songbu with another unit. The Japanese troops in Songbu are already showing signs of wavering. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northern Henan Chinese Army Wins General Offensive</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army in northern Henan launched a general offensive on the Japanese positions in Xinyang, Bo'ai, Jiaozuo, and Xuliang west of Xinxiang on the north bank of the Yellow River at dawn on April 29. After four hours of street fighting in Xuliang, the Chinese army recaptured the city. The Chinese army in southern Shanxi is now continuing to attack Yongcheng, Xiaxian, Anyi, and Jiexian. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing Madly: Many Bombs Dropped in Downtown Areas, Fires Started, Casualties Unknown; Chinese Fighter Planes Take Off to Intercept, Shooting Down Seven Japanese Bombers</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) At 11:20 AM on the 3rd, the local air defense headquarters reported from Yuanling that many Japanese planes were flying from east to west. At around 12:30 PM, another report was received from Youyang that two groups of Japanese planes were flying north. An air raid alarm was issued at 12:45 PM, and Chinese planes also took off to intercept. An emergency alarm was issued at 12:55 PM. Japanese planes invaded the city airspace at 1:17 PM in the afternoon. Their bombing targets seemed to be certain military organs, but the military organs had long been evacuated to the countryside. The Japanese pilots' skills were extremely poor, causing nearby shops and residences to be bombed. In addition to dropping heavy bombs, they also dropped a large number of incendiary bombs. Xisi Street, Zuoying Street, and other places immediately caught fire and burned for a long time. At this time, the Chinese defense corps, police, and various rescue organizations all rushed out to rescue amidst the explosions. They worked hard with great spirit and extreme indignation. Their tragic and indignant emotions and sense of responsibility were fully demonstrated. The general public was also very calm, obeyed order, and did not panic, which shows that the people have the greatest determination. The number of deaths and injuries, as well as public and private losses, are being actively excavated and investigated. At the same time, the air defense department and the joint office for emergency relief from air raids are jointly handling the aftermath. The Japanese planes were fiercely attacked by Chinese planes and fled in panic at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. It is reported that one plane was shot down by Chinese planes and is now being searched for in nearby areas. Also, today the Japanese planes dropped hundreds of packs of "New Youpai" cigarettes wrapped in red paper, some of which contained poisonous gas and are currently being tested. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Since January 15th of this year, Chongqing had not been subjected to air raids for a long time. At 1:15 PM this afternoon, 27 Japanese planes suddenly flew over Chongqing. Many Chinese fighter planes immediately took off to intercept, shooting down one Japanese bomber. However, several Japanese planes dropped incendiary bombs and many bombs, causing smoke and flames to rise. Losses are unknown. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The most densely populated area of Chongqing was heavily bombed by Japanese planes just after noon today. It is believed that there must be a large number of casualties. Japanese bombers dropped many bombs on the bustling streets on the north bank of the Yangtze River, causing a major fire. The office of the French-Chinese Joint Navigation Company was hit, and the building was bombed to the ground. One car parked in the garage was destroyed, and four Chinese people were buried in the rubble. Only two people have been dug out so far. The situation a hundred yards away is extremely tragic, as dozens of wooden houses caught fire from incendiary bombs and spread rapidly. The Dagong Newspaper office was also burned down. Many people were gathered at the riverside pier, boarding boats to cross to the south bank. The bombs fell before the boats could cast off, killing at least seventy people. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle, Japanese Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, 22 Japanese planes attacked Chongqing, dropping dozens of incendiary bombs and light explosive bombs, causing fires in seven places at the same time. Thick smoke covered the sky, rising to a hundred feet. According to initial statistics, this attack resulted in 1,000 casualties, including 100 deaths. Considering the entire population of Chongqing, 1,000 casualties cannot be considered many, which shows the effectiveness of the city's air raid shelters. The city's firefighters bravely fought the fires and were very effective. Although lookouts reported that 45 Japanese bombers were approaching, only 22 planes actually reached Chongqing. This Japanese air raid was planned, as the planes flew over Chongqing twice, dropping bombs on densely populated cities. The Japanese planes dropped all their bombs in two minutes, without bombing the areas where the government is located. At the same time, they used machine guns to strafe the crowds. The residence of Mr. Troessel, the German manager of the American-owned Bowerton White Lister Company, was bombed and collapsed, and Mr. Troessel was seriously injured. The China-France Navigation Company was also hit. Two bombs also fell near the YMCA, but fortunately did not explode. One fell outside the YMCA entrance, and the other fell in the square. A bomb fell twenty yards away from the Canadian Friends Society. When another bomb exploded, fragments affected the square of the Canadian Women's Association dormitory and a certain hotel. Miss Peters and Miss Gomelly both reside there. According to this air raid, only 22 Japanese planes reached Chongqing, because Chinese fighter planes, after receiving the alarm, immediately flew into the air to intercept, so many Japanese planes were repelled at that time and failed to reach their destination. When the Japanese planes flew to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, they were intercepted by Chinese planes, and a fierce battle broke out between the two sides. According to Chinese statistics, at least three Japanese planes were shot down in Chongqing. At the same time, Associated Press reporters saw three Japanese pilots descend by parachute. He first saw one person descend, and then saw two people descend together in one parachute, all falling into the Chinese airfield. However, according to foreign observers, only one Japanese plane was shot down, while two Chinese planes were shot down. Also, according to the most reliable sources, the exact number of dead and wounded is over one thousand, because one bomb hit a refugee shelter. It is not yet known whether all the refugees in the refugee shelter were killed or injured, but it is believed that at least fifty people were killed. Also, four Chongqing newspapers suffered heavy losses, namely Dagong Newspaper, Xinhua Daily, Southwest Daily, and New Sichuan Newspaper. Among them, Southwest Daily and New Sichuan Newspaper suffered heavier losses and may not be able to continue publishing immediately. Another bomb fell on the air defense headquarters, causing a large amount of gasoline and oil stored in the warehouse to catch fire. The fire was very fierce. Anti-aircraft guns fired continuously, and many shell fragments fell. It is reported that a sampan in the Yangtze River was hit by a bomb. This afternoon, the fire was brought under control, and hundreds of workers and firefighters were demolishing the houses near the fire to prevent the fire from spreading. The Japanese planes came at 1:00 PM, and after dropping their bombs, they planned to fly away. However, when they attacked the Chinese military airfield, they were intercepted by Chinese planes, and an air battle broke out. The streets were littered with debris, and black smoke filled the sky. After the main power lines in the commercial district were destroyed, the lights and telephones were cut off. After the air raid ended, people fled to both banks of the Yangtze River, rushing into Central Park for temporary shelter, carrying their belongings. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>A certain place. Forty-five Japanese Type 96 twin-engine bombers, formed into five teams, deployed in a square formation, invaded Chongqing's airspace from west to east at about 1:40 PM, dropping bombs. The Chinese air force took off before the Japanese planes attacked, preparing to intercept. When the Japanese planes were dropping their bombs, Chinese planes caught up head-on. The Chinese vanguard team launched a fierce attack on the Japanese vanguard team, and the Chinese follow-up teams attacked the Japanese plane teams in front of them. Machine guns fired everywhere. The Chinese planes, with their accumulated strength, bravely advanced into the Japanese plane formation amidst enemy fire, launching continuous and close attacks. The Japanese plane formation became loose. Chinese planes either encircled and attacked one Japanese plane with several planes, or attacked one Japanese plane with one plane until it was shot down. During the pursuit, all Chinese planes reached their maximum fuel range or ran out of ammunition. The surviving Japanese planes fled east in a panic, and gradually gathered near Shizhu before fleeing east. As a result of this battle, three Japanese planes were hit by Chinese planes and caught fire in the air, falling into the valley east of Guangyang Dam. Also, when a certain team leader was attacking, he saw four Japanese planes descending with heavy smoke, crashing in the area east of Chongqing. According to another team member's eyewitness account, he saw 38 Japanese planes flying east. A total of seven Japanese planes were lost. Further, according to intelligence from Shizhu, Japanese planes east of Shizhu were hit in the fuel tanks and crashed. This is being investigated. Two Chinese planes parachuted, and one parachute landed near the police academy. This battle was quite fierce and rare in recent air battles. Most of the bombs dropped by Japanese planes landed in the Yangtze River and Jialing River, and a small number landed in urban areas, all in residential areas. The Japanese, at the end of their rope and struggling desperately, did not hesitate to be inhumane, indiscriminately bombing unarmed Chinese citizens. We will not only impose sanctions based on world opinion, but we will definitely use our strength to curb the brutality of the Japanese army and avenge our dead compatriots. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<h3>The So-Called "Huaxing Bank"</h3>
<p>The "Huaxing Bank," jointly established by the puppet organizations in central China at the instigation of Japan and various Japanese banks, was announced yesterday in Shanghai and is rumored to be about to issue counterfeit currency in order to seize Chinese legal tender circulating in areas currently occupied by the Japanese army. In order to undermine Chinese wartime finance and realize its so-called "yen bloc," Japan last year issued counterfeit "United Reserve Bank" banknotes under the name of the so-called "United Reserve Bank." The value of these counterfeit banknotes is now falling sharply. According to a recent Reuters dispatch, the premium for swapping counterfeit banknotes for Chinese legal tender in North China has reached 34.5%. By analogy, it is not difficult to foresee the future of the so-called "Huaxing Bank."</p>
<p>It is very difficult to establish a country's monetary system, but it is not easy to destroy it. With the solid foundation of the Chinese legal tender system and the loyalty of the people to their country, any financial conspiracy by Japan will not achieve unexpected gains. This has been proven by the failure of counterfeit banknotes in North China. Moreover, Japan's attempt to undermine the Chinese legal tender system is only an attempt, and in reality, it does not have the ability. The failure of counterfeit banknotes in North China was due to having the name but not the substance, making it impossible to obtain foreign exchange. The counterfeit banknotes about to be issued in central China will of course also have no so-called reserve. Some may think that the yen will be used as a reserve, but the amount of banknotes issued in Japan at the end of last year had expanded to 2.9 billion yen. Most of the banknote reserves have been used to purchase military supplies. If the counterfeit banknotes in central China are backed by the yen, it will indirectly accelerate the inflation of Japanese banknotes. Some may think that foreign currency will be used as a reserve, but in the current anti-aggression movement of various democratic countries, who would be willing to bear the responsibility of helping aggression? Japan's credit in the international community, not to mention that there is no guaranteed loan to support counterfeit Chinese banknotes, will not be secured. Even the so-called industrial construction loans, under Japan's current policy of excluding European and American interests in China, have already closed the door to borrowing. It is reported that last year, the puppet Manchurian government borrowed 10 million US dollars from the United States for railway equipment, but it was rejected by the United States. Some may think that counterfeit banknotes will be exchanged for legal tender, and the reserve of legal tender will be used as a reserve. Although this is Japan's hope, the reality is extremely slim, because the Chinese government has long imposed extremely strict controls on foreign exchange. Some may think that the foreign exchange from the export of goods can be used as a reserve. Although this is possible, how can hoping for plums quench thirst? What is the real reserve except for the Japanese soldiers' pistols and bayonets?</p>
<p>In fact, Japan has always known that the current counterfeit banknotes in North China cannot destroy China's legal tender system. The counterfeit banknotes in central China in the future will be the same as the counterfeit banknotes in North China, and will absolutely not have the ability to compete with Chinese legal tender. However, Japan, at a time when the people are impoverished and resources are exhausted, cannot but take this method of issuing counterfeit banknotes in order to妄想to achieve the illusion of creating a "new order in East Asia." Therefore, Japan instigates puppet organizations to gradually expand the scope of counterfeit banknote issuance, not to establish the foundation of a monetary system for puppet organizations. The issuance of counterfeit banknotes, in relation to puppet organizations, is at most a loan of economic blood debts in military occupation areas when Japan is economically unable to assist. Japan's real purpose is to take advantage of the convenience of the yen bloc to exploit the people in the guerrilla areas of China as much as possible as a temporary support for the war against China, and to use counterfeit banknotes as a basis to control foreign exchange and vigorously exclude all European and American power in China.</p>
<p>The only role that counterfeit banknotes currently have in the guerrilla areas of China is to facilitate trade with Japan: that is, to use counterfeit banknotes to forcibly buy goods in the guerrilla areas of China, transfer them for export, and obtain foreign exchange, which is then controlled. Exporting merchants must sell foreign exchange to puppet banks, and importing merchants must obtain foreign exchange supply in advance. This is the way it is done in North China. For example, last year Japan's trade with North China, both imports and exports, doubled from the previous year. At the same time, it can also use Chinese commodities that Japan does not need to exchange for various raw materials needed for Japanese military affairs. For example, the so-called import commodity list with priority rights formulated by the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in North China completely supplies foreign exchange for the supplies of the Japanese army first. On the contrary, the trade of European and American countries with North China, whether it is imports or exports, is either restricted by Japan or has no profit, so the trade volume has been greatly reduced. Now, in order to obtain more raw materials and a larger market, and in order to more actively exclude the rights and interests of European and American countries in China, Japan naturally wants to expand the scope of counterfeit banknote issuance to the central China region.</p>
<p>The Chinese government had already taken precautions against Japan's attempt, such as prohibiting the free flow of goods between the mainland and the guerrilla areas, improving and reorganizing the local finances of the war zone, and the guerrillas' strict punishment of those who use counterfeit banknotes. These are all effective ways to deal with Japan's issuance of counterfeit banknotes. Therefore, Japan's attempt to issue counterfeit banknotes in central China will have a limited ability to damage Chinese legal tender. In terms of the current actual situation, the circulation of counterfeit banknotes in central China in the future will not be outside of several larger cities directly controlled by Japanese military force. The people living in these areas and the European and American overseas merchants who operate foreign trade in central China will be greatly affected. The latter will likely encounter the same environment as in North China. This is something that European and American overseas Chinese in China should pay special attention to. At the time of the establishment of the puppet "Huaxing Bank," it is said that Shanghai's Chinese and foreign banks and money houses decided not to cooperate. This is a necessary measure for the people of Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, to protect their own economic interests in central China!</p>

<h3>"United Reserve Bank" Value Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) "United Reserve Bank" banknotes have fallen slightly again in North China. The exchange rate is 34.5%, so today it takes 134.5 yuan of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes to buy 100 yuan of legal tender. The exchange rate has risen by 50 cents compared to yesterday.

This morning in Tianjin, "United Reserve Bank" banknotes had to be discounted by 34.5% to exchange for 100 yuan of legal tender. Although the Japanese side still claims that "United Reserve Bank" banknotes are of the same value as Japanese currency, it is still difficult to purchase Japanese exchange with "United Reserve Bank" banknotes today, and a discount of 25% is required.

<h3>Great Victory on the Eastern Front: Re-capture of Lishui</h3>
<p>Guangde: This morning, Chinese forces re-captured Lishui, Chongyi, and Tang, and surrounded Honglanbu, marking a significant victory on the Eastern Front. Lishui, a shield for Nanjing and an important stronghold on the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway, had been lost for 18 months. Chinese forces had counter-attacked several times without success. The fact that Chinese forces captured two locations in a matter of hours indicates that the Japanese army no longer possesses combat capabilities. The war situation in Jiangnan is about to undergo major developments. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guangde: A certain mobile unit of the Chinese army, taking advantage of the moonlit and calm night of the 2nd, launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army in Lishui, who were awakened from their sleep.

<h3>Li Xiaqing's Fundraising in the United States Achieves Excellent Results</h3>
<p>(Washington) Chinese female aviators Li Luqing and Yan Yaqing, after deciding to fly to various parts of the United States to raise funds for their homeland, set off separately. Li flew from Boston to Miami on March 30th. The local government immediately sent a special car to greet her. Under the leadership of the mayor's wife, an unprecedented banquet was held, attended by more than 600 women from all walks of life. The University of Miami held a meeting with more than 1,500 university students, offering a warm welcome. During fundraising in the area, a Mr. Grande, in light of China's heroic resistance and the brutal killing or displacement of civilians by the Japanese invaders, took the lead by donating $1,000. A certain lady also generously donated $5,000. There were many other smaller donations. This promising start can be seen as a precursor to future success. On April 8th, she continued flying to New Orleans, where the governor and mayor both extended extremely sincere receptions and took the lead in donating to encourage others. During her three-day stay, all the city's newspapers carried stories about the new model for women in China, and those who previously held indifferent attitudes toward Far Eastern issues also underwent a change, shifting from attention to concern. The pro-China atmosphere is becoming increasingly strong. On April 11th, she flew to Houston. Li's broadcast on a local radio station about the Three Resolutions has already attracted great attention from all sectors. After changing to a new plane in Washington, Ms. Yan Yaqing is more actively expanding the extent of her flights, extending her trip until the end of July. (Editor's note: Yan was slightly injured in a plane crash in Prattville on May 1st, and the original schedule may need to be changed.) She then set off for Philadelphia. On the morning of that day, those who saw her off at the airport included Bishop Yu Bin, all the staff of the special representative office of the Relief Commission, Counselor Chen Changle of the Embassy, Military Attaché Shao, representatives of overseas Chinese, and many newspaper reporters.

<h3>Chinese Army Units Attacking Xuzhou Are Currently Surrounding Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: A certain unit of the Chinese army, which had previously moved from Huaibei back to the Xuzhou area, joined forces with the Pixian Standing Detachment, the county police force, and coordinated with the × Road Army. One part advanced towards Taierzhuang, detouring to attack Xuzhou. On April 6th, they advanced to the area of Sihuliangbi and unexpectedly encountered several hundred Japanese infantry and artillery soldiers, along with five or six armored vehicles, coming south from the Tai-Zhao branch road. The local residents had previously dug many trenches along the road to prevent Japanese heavy weaponry from entering, so when the Japanese army used armored vehicles to charge toward the Chinese army's position, two of them fell into the trenches and could not move. The Chinese army seized the opportunity to encircle and attack, destroying two Japanese armored vehicles and killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army then deployed four cannons and concentrated their fire. The Chinese army then shifted its forces westward, crossing the Tai-Yue Road. The Japanese army then rushed to Sihuliangbi and Daxiao Liangbi, setting fire to them, turning both villages to ashes, and killing five or sixty residents who had not had time to escape, to vent their anger. The Chinese army then dispatched troops to attack the flanks and rear of the Japanese army, and sent a capable force to advance northwest, attacking Taierzhuang, and engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese garrison and the Japanese army that came south to reinforce them. After holding out for several hours, they shifted their forces west to the Xiaotashan area on the border of Tong and Pi. However, when passing through the Tai-Zhao branch line, they destroyed many sections of the railway. They are still garrisoning troops in the Xiaotashan area on the border of Tong and Pi. The Japanese army has transferred troops from Xuzhou to reinforce them, and are constantly engaging in fierce battles with the Chinese army. The sound of artillery can be heard in the city of Xuzhou. The Chinese army is familiar with the terrain and is preparing to attack Xuzhou when the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Another report states that since the arrival of the × unit of the Chinese army in the Lu-Su border area, the morale of the people has become increasingly elevated. The Japanese army in Xuzhou feels greatly threatened. The presence of the × unit of the Chinese army has been detected west of Taierzhuang and east of Xuzhou, and they are continuing to intensify the encirclement of Xuzhou. At the same time, Chinese local teams and civilian armed forces are working hard to destroy the Japanese transportation lines. The Japanese army in Xuzhou is panicking and has sent telegrams to the Japanese army headquarters requesting reinforcements.</p>
<h3>The Yangzhou Broadsword Brigade Rises Up to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army in Yangzhou has recently been greatly alarmed by the full-scale counter-offensive launched by the Chinese army in northern Jiangsu. In order to prevent the Chinese army from attacking them, they have dispatched several hundred infantry and artillery soldiers (including a unit of puppet troops) to continuously patrol various places in the northeast, attempting to carry out their so-called pacification work. At the same time, they are intensifying the forced recruitment of able-bodied men to organize puppet troops in order to cultivate the power of traitors for their own use. The "Broadsword Society," which was previously organized by the Japanese army, has recently risen up in rebellion because of the excessive oppression by the Japanese puppets, and because the able-bodied men in the society have been arbitrarily forced by the Japanese army to join the puppet troops, forcing them to kill each other, which is completely contrary to the conditions of protecting their homeland. Therefore, they have risen up in rebellion and have made contact with the guerrilla forces lurking in the suburbs, renaming themselves the Broadsword Brigade and launching continuous attacks on the Japanese army. As a result, the Japanese army is in great panic. On the morning of the 14th, a Japanese patrol unit of more than 300 infantry and artillery soldiers was ambushed by the Chinese army in Lizhen Town. The Broadsword Brigade also rose up to help in the battle, surrounding them on three sides. The puppet troops fled without firing a shot, causing the Japanese front line to be in chaos. The Chinese army took the opportunity to kill them, and countless were shot or hacked to death with broadswords. By 12:00 noon, the Japanese were unable to withstand the assault and fled in panic to the west. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered fifty or sixty casualties, with more than thirty bodies left behind. The Chinese army captured three small steel cannons, one machine gun, and nine rifles, and captured two Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Bai Yutang, the puppet commander of the Yangzhou-Zhenjiang area puppet river pacification, has imposed pressure on the local people and distributed his lackeys to search for and collect civilian guns and extort civilian property since taking office as a puppet official. His crimes are numerous, causing widespread resentment among the people. Recently, the Japanese army ordered him to harass the Chinese army, but Bai did not dare to act rashly due to his limited strength, and only made excuses. The Japanese army was furious because of this, believing that Bai was not working hard and must have ulterior motives. On the 15th, Bai was arrested in Shijiaoqiao, shackled with heavy shackles, and escorted to Zhenjiang for interrogation. It is said that Bai has been executed by shooting in Zhenjiang. The fate of the traitor is like this, and it can serve as a warning to his kind.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Jiangyin Invades Church Hospital</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The American Presbyterian Church has been preaching Christianity in Jiangyin for more than forty years. The first pastor was named Hai, followed by Pastor Li Deli and Medical Doctor Hua Erde, and others. They founded Lizhi Boys' Middle School, Fushi Girls' Middle School, and Shengdao Hospital, along with various public charitable undertakings. Most of the buildings on Henan Street in Dongwai are church property. Because of Jiangyin's importance as a fortress, whenever internal wars broke out in the past, any disputes were often peacefully resolved through the mediation of Hua Erde and others. The most complete of the various undertakings they founded was Shengdao Hospital, which treated countless male and female patients every year. The shortfall in finances was subsidized by the Presbyterian Church in Huntington, USA. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan the previous year, Jiangyin fell, and the school and hospital buildings were destroyed by fire. Most Christians were evacuated. Hospital staff, led by Pastor Mu Weide and Director Chen Yulin, and dozens of male and female nurses, hired boats to take the important medicines and equipment in the hospital to Zhangjia Village in Xintuo Town, Wujin, to stay temporarily, while still treating patients. Last spring, they moved to Qiaoqi Town. In March of this year, Pastor Mu and the doctors and nurses returned to Dongwai and set up a treatment center in the remaining buildings, offering outpatient services on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings and afternoons. Starting in mid-April, they offered outpatient services in the morning and house calls in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, the head of the Japanese military special forces Jiangyin squad, Pu Huixiong, informed the puppet police station a few days ago and ordered Shengdao Hospital to stop treating patients, causing great inconvenience to the residents of Jiangyin. The Christian church has already appealed to the American consulate about this matter.</p>

<h3>American Chamber of Commerce Vigorously Advocates Maintaining the Far Eastern Market, Even if it Means War with Japan; American Ambassador Johnson to Return to China Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States Chamber of Commerce Federation held a banquet here last night. Representatives from all American commercial firms with interests abroad participated. The representatives stated that the United States must find a way to maintain its markets in China and the Philippine Islands, even if it means war with Japan. In addition, they also advocated providing credit loans to Latin American countries and selling them gold to develop trade and compete with European countries. Francis, the vice president of the Sino-American Chamber of Commerce, said that the Chinese government is currently planning to develop industry. The implementation of this plan could enable the United States to export goods worth 750 million US dollars to China annually for the next generation, but only on the condition that the country's market is not monopolized by Japan. "In order to protect trade, our country is willing to resort to war when necessary. If a country can maintain its independent sovereignty and become our country's most important future customer, then for the sake of our country's interests, we should protect trade with that country." If the Chinese market is blocked by Japan, our country's market in the Philippine Islands will inevitably be lost as a result. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(San Francisco) American Ambassador to China Johnson, who had returned to the country to report on the situation in the Far East to President Roosevelt, is now preparing to depart on Friday to return to his post. Johnson told reporters today that the war in the Far East will be protracted for a long time because the basis for a peaceful solution is still lacking, and China has abundant food and clothing, and its people are highly motivated. Furthermore, Japanese planes arbitrarily bomb the residential centers of the Chinese people, which only intensifies the Chinese people's animosity towards Japan. "When the Chinese people encounter Japanese air raids, their discipline is amazing. When the planes drop bombs, the people do not panic. After an hour, they work together to remove the corpses, and the injured are sent to the hospital for treatment, and the market trade is restored." (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Government Restricts Imports of Japanese Goods: Consular Visa Method to be Implemented Starting This Month</h3>
<p>(Paris) Since the outbreak of the war between China and Japan, Japan has strictly managed the exchange rate. France's trade with Japan has changed from a trade surplus to a trade deficit. In order to remedy this, the government has decided to implement consular visa methods for Japanese goods. The government gazette recently issued an order, stating that starting from the 10th of this month, various Japanese goods, except raw silk and camphor (natural camphor that has not been purified, camphor powder produced on the island of Taiwan, and purified camphor and artificial camphor are all included), that are transported to France or to French colonies must be accompanied by a special certificate signed by the commercial counselor of the French Embassy in Japan or by the French consul, otherwise they will be prohibited from import. However, various goods that have been loaded onto ships for export before May 10th are not subject to this provision. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the government decided to implement consular visa methods for Japanese imports starting from the 10th of this month, responsible persons explained that this measure is not to prohibit the import of Japanese goods. Since goods exported from France to Japan are subject to restrictions in that country, and the commercial talks between Japan and France are progressing very slowly, this measure is being implemented so that retaliatory measures can be taken against Japan when necessary. Once a commercial agreement is reached, it may be revoked. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Japan Visits Japanese Vice Foreign Minister: Protests Seizure of Vessels</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Craigie visited the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday and was received by the Vice Minister. Craigie requested the early release of a British ship detained by the Japanese Navy in the Guangzhou area. According to the Japanese side, the reason for the ship's detention was that it was carrying military supplies for the Chinese army. Craigie also inquired about the "Reform Government's" approval of the establishment of the "China and Japan Bank." (3rd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Conservative Party member Morgan asked Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons today whether the Japanese side had allowed British nationals residing in Jiujiang to return to inspect their property.

<h3>Britain Prepares to Exchange Security Guarantees with Germany; Chamberlain Announces in Parliament that the Policy of Encirclement Is Groundless</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, in response to inquiries from Labour MP Henderson in the House of Commons today, stated that he would make it clear in his upcoming speech that the notion of Britain adopting a policy of encircling Germany is entirely unfounded.  President Roosevelt's proposal, and that offered by Hitler, involve an exchange of non-aggression guarantees, not on a mutual basis, as with the guarantee recently given to Poland. The British government is indeed prepared to consider the suggestion of exchanging mutual guarantees with the German government.  Regarding Germany's abrogation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British government considers that the guarantee recently given to Poland does not conflict with the naval agreement. There is no clause in the agreement that allows one of the contracting parties to deem the agreement as effective. He cannot decide if this is another treaty proposal made by Hitler, but the government is considering how to respond.  Naval Secretary Stanhope then declared that, as a result of the abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, a decision on whether to dismantle or retain the two "King George V" class battleships armed with 15-inch guns has not yet been made.  An MP inquired of Foreign Minister Butler if the U.S. government had sent a copy of its recent statement to the Japanese government regarding the opening of the Yangtze River to merchant shipping to the British government. Butler replied in the affirmative. Butler also stated that the British government is not engaged in making the guarantees given to Romania and Greece of a mutual nature.  An MP asked if the Shanghai Municipal Council had been permitted to continue dredging the waterways at the entrance to Shanghai. Butler replied in the negative, adding that active negotiations with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai are underway and a compromise is expected soon.  Conservative MP Milner then questioned that these negotiations have been ongoing for too long, and the work of the Council is internationally related to the shipping industry of various countries, and that the Foreign Minister should give greater weight to further negotiations. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax is fully aware of the importance of the Council's work and hopes that the ongoing negotiations will yield a more promising response. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Visit Germany, No Agreement Reached</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky returned here this morning at 9:00 AM from Berlin. Cabinet members and many dignitaries welcomed them at the station. Government Party Leader Tiaryon delivered a brief welcoming speech, stating that the opinions of Germany and Hungary were harmonious. Prime Minister Teleki replied that his observations during the trip led him to believe that Germany has genuine and deep friendship for Hungary, "and that both sides can cooperate in good faith to seek welfare for both nations and strive to maintain peace in Central Europe."  The official news agency issued a statement stating, "The relationship between Germany and Hungary has always been close and does not need to be formalized in writing. Therefore, Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky did not sign any agreement with the German authorities." Strengthening relations among countries in the Danube River region was also discussed. Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky also told the news agency, "The task of our trip has been completed. In essence, the talks held with the German authorities are the best guarantee for maintaining a friendly environment between the two countries. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Germany Suggests Security Pact to Four Nordic Nations; Sweden Says Germany Only Seeking Opinions; Åland Islands Fortification Issue Resolved</h3>
<p>(Berlin) When Chancellor Hitler gave a speech the other day, he said that if the countries referred to in President Roosevelt's telegram requested guarantees from Germany, Germany was prepared to provide mutual guarantees under absolutely mutual principles. According to reliable sources, the German government has already conducted negotiations with the Nordic countries based on this speech, hoping to conclude bilateral guarantee agreements." This is also said in competent circles, that the German government has conducted preliminary talks with certain countries. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital It is rumored that the German government has begun negotiations with the Nordic countries (i.e., Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland) in the hope of concluding non-aggression treaties. Responsible figures here recently denied it, saying that Germany has not conducted such negotiations, but has only sought the opinions of the Nordic countries to find out if there is any hope of success if a proposal for negotiations is put forward. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The agreement between Finland and Sweden on the issue of fortifying the Åland Islands has recently been accepted by the German government. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources, the German government recently issued a note to Sweden and Finland regarding the Åland Islands issue, stating that Germany must agree to Finland's fortification of the island under certain conditions. The Åland Islands are located in the Baltic Sea, between Finland and Sweden, at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, with a strategic location. Until 1917, it belonged to Russia, and in 1921, it was assigned to Finland by the League of Nations Administrative Council. Russia's declaration of 1856 not to set up defenses on the island was also inherited by Finland, and a treaty was signed by Britain, Sweden, Finland, and the Soviet Union to certify it. At the beginning of January this year, Finland and Sweden decided on a plan to allow Finland to fortify the island due to changes in the international situation. The main points are as follows: (1) Finland may take military measures in the southern part of the Åland Islands; (2) Finland may only take limited military measures in the northern part of the island, with a term of ten years, the scope of which shall be stipulated by separate agreements between Finland and Sweden; (3) Finland may implement a conscription system in the country, but must appoint Swedish officers and sergeants to garrison the island and issue orders in Swedish. The above measures will be submitted to the Finnish Parliament for discussion, and after they are passed, a meeting of representatives of the residents of the Åland Islands will be held for approval.

<h3>Polish Foreign Minister to Deliver Speech Tomorrow, Adopting Offensive Diplomacy, Announcing Stance on Danzig, German Press Retorts</h3>
<p>Warsaw  Certain well-informed sources here recently declared that Foreign Minister Beck is scheduled to deliver a statement to the House of Representatives on the 5th of this month, in response to German Chancellor Hitler's speech on April 28th, proposing to place the Free City of Danzig under Polish protection. The steps are nothing more than: (1) Polish land and naval forces should be stationed in Danzig; (2) The Polish government should have the power to veto any decisions made by the city council; (3) The city's heavy industry should be placed under Polish control to prevent it from supplying Germany with munitions. As for the German reaction to this, once it is revealed, it will be clear whether Chancellor Hitler is still intimidating with empty threats or is willing to reach an understanding with Poland. If Hitler is truly sincere in wanting to reconcile with Poland, then both sides can make concessions and come to a compromise solution. In short, Polish military circles are all advocating for an offensive stance towards Germany. It is said that although Germany can occupy the Free City of Danzig within three hours, Polish troops will be able to arrive first, and it can be asserted that the only railway and highway line from the German province of East Prussia to the city must pass through Polish territory, making it difficult to operate freely. As for the attitudes of other countries, they are also favorable to Poland. British Ambassador Kennard has repeatedly stated to Foreign Minister Beck that if Poland believes it is being threatened by Germany, and if Poland deems it necessary to intervene in Danzig, Britain will provide unreserved assistance. The French government has also provided the same guarantee. In addition, Lithuanian Army Commander-in-Chief General Raštikis, at the invitation of Polish Army Inspector General General Śmigły-Rydz, is scheduled to come here before the 8th of this month to discuss close military cooperation to resist German aggression. As for the relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union, it is developing smoothly. Although Poland is unwilling to conclude a political or military agreement with the Soviet Union, it also openly acknowledges that the Soviet Union can provide Poland with great assistance, especially in supplying raw materials. In addition, as far as the domestic situation in Poland is concerned, all the government's efforts are supported by the people. For example, since the issuance of national defense bonds, two hundred million złoty (Polish currency) have been sold in a few weeks, which is one aspect of it. Also, although May 1st is International Labor Day, most union members are still willing to work as usual and donate their wages to the national defense fund. In addition, the Polish government is actively preparing in terms of military and industry. All officers in the army's specialized units and reserves have been ordered to report for duty to take on special tasks. Reserve soldiers have also been enlisted in batches for short-term training. Various raw materials and grains have also been stockpiled as much as possible to avoid being taken advantage of by any incident. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw  The Dziennik Bydgoski, an important newspaper here, recently published a long article describing the historical relationship between Poland and the German province of East Prussia. According to Article 96 of the Treaty of Versailles, the German authorities should hold a referendum in Warmia and Masuria in East Prussia to decide whether the localities should belong to Poland or Germany, but the country's authorities have not yet done so. "We therefore have the right to demand that a solution be found to the East Prussian question, because from any point of view, whether historical, geographical, or economic, the province is closely linked to Poland, and the local residents also speak Slavic languages and have not yet been 'Germanized.'" (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Yesterday, all the newspapers in Berlin published articles on the front page discussing the issue of German-Polish relations. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung commented, "Since the signing of the agreement between Polish Prime Minister Piłsudski and Chancellor Hitler in January 1934, Poland has achieved its current status as a major power. The Franco-Polish alliance established between Poland and France in 1921 and the non-aggression treaty signed with Soviet Russia in 1932 failed to make Poland a major power. Poland is now colluding with Britain, implementing a policy of encirclement, and abandoning its historical mission as a buffer state between its eastern and western neighbors. In reality, Britain's interests in protecting the western borders of the Soviet Union from Labrador to Bessarabia are greater than Poland's interests in Danzig. However, the balance of power that Poland has always paid attention to has now been suddenly lost." (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The main topic of discussion in Polish newspapers these days is Poland's attitude towards Danzig and Upper Silesia. This morning, the German newspapers severely criticized it. The Völkischer Beobachter, the mouthpiece of the Nazi Party, believes that the propaganda of Polish newspapers is at least condoned by the Polish government, or even carries out the government's intentions. As for Chamberlain and Daladier, who have recently positioned themselves as protectors of Poland, they have taken a hands-off approach to the rhetoric of Polish newspapers without comment, which is quite noteworthy. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung is highly ironic about Poland's demand to be the protector of Danzig. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Poland Celebrates National Day with Military Parade</h3>
<p>Warsaw  The First Republic of Poland was founded in 1791. Today marks the 148th anniversary, and celebrations are taking place enthusiastically throughout the country. Major cities are holding military parades. National flags are hung all over the streets of the city, and most stores display portraits of the late Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski, the current Inspector General of Military Education Śmigły-Rydz, and Foreign Minister Beck. Foreign embassies, including the Czechoslovakian embassy, also display their respective national flags. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Portuguese Friendship</h3>
<p>Lisbon  The President of Portugal, Carmona, presented the country's highest medal to King George VI of England. According to the government gazette, Portugal's move is enough to prove the centuries-old friendship between England and Portugal. The Portuguese people have feelings for the British government and the public, and the ancient alliance between England and Portugal is still valid. (Reuter, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Russian Negotiations are Slow; MPs Raise Questions; Talk of Meeting Between British, French, and Russian Foreign Ministers; Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Talks with Turkish Officials</h3>
<p>(London) During the afternoon meeting of the House of Commons today, Major Attlee, leader of the opposition Labour Party, raised questions about the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, saying that the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have been going on for a long time without reaching an agreement, and that some of the public in this country have become impatient. He asked whether the government was actively conducting negotiations. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are currently in progress, and the two sides have put forward many plans and counter-plans. The details of which cannot be disclosed before substantial achievements have been made. "I cannot prevent those who have doubts, but I am convinced that Mr. Attlee will not encourage such doubts, nor will he want to stir up trouble between Britain and the Soviet Union. In short, the talks between Britain and the Soviet Union are very harmonious, and the British government has never lacked sincerity. The two sides will consider all the details and take into account the views of other governments." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the establishment of a collective security system, Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, providing some explanations on the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. According to sources close to the government, British Foreign Secretary Halifax, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov will meet in Paris or London to finalize the draft agreement to be established between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is heard that the Soviet government will propose three suggestions: (1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign an alliance treaty; (2) The countries along the Baltic and Black Seas should be jointly guaranteed by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union; (3) Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland may be guaranteed by the Soviet Union. The British government will also make suggestions advocating three things: (1) The Soviet Union should follow Britain and France in providing guarantees to Poland and Romania; (2) The Soviet Union should provide unilateral guarantees to other neighboring countries, namely Finland, Estonia, and Latvia, but when and what kind of assistance these countries require from the Soviet Union should be determined by these countries; (3) Once the Soviet Union provides unilateral guarantees to the above countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign a mutual assistance agreement. Moreover, according to British political figures, the Soviet government still has objections to the proposals made by Britain, but when its neighboring countries are invaded in the future, they can first request assistance from Britain and France, and then ask the Soviet Union for help to avoid the Soviet Union taking on the burden alone. If the British government puts forward this method to the Soviet Union, the country may not express any further objections. As far as the British proposal is concerned, there is no longer a risk of Soviet troops automatically passing through the borders of the Baltic countries, which is one of its advantages. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the establishment of a collective security system, the British government is actively conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union on the one hand, and closely monitoring the negotiations between Romania, Turkey, and Bulgaria, because Romania and Turkey are currently trying to bring Bulgaria into the Balkan Entente. The suggestions made by the British government to Bulgaria have been taken back to Bulgaria by the country's envoy to England, Monchilov, for instructions. The envoy is scheduled to return here tomorrow to continue talks with the British authorities. According to responsible figures here, the goal of the Balkan Entente was to resist Bulgarian aggression. Today, what the Balkan countries want to worry about is external aggression, not the aggression of one Balkan country. This kind of entente no longer needs to maintain its original form and should establish a new entente. It is heard that Bulgaria is preparing to participate in this new entente, but with two conditions: (1) Romania must return Dobruja (which belonged to Bulgaria before the war) to Bulgaria; (2) Greece must cede the port of Dedeağaç on the Aegean Sea to Bulgaria as its access to the sea. If Romania and Greece cannot do so immediately, they must provide guarantees that they will be willing to fulfill these conditions once the situation permits. Bulgaria may also consider it satisfactory. In addition, according to well-informed sources here, the Italian government recently proposed to Bulgaria that it should unite the countries concerned under its leadership to form a group of neutral countries in the Balkan Peninsula, but the Bulgarian government's attitude is very cold. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin has been negotiating with Turkish authorities for five days, but has not yet reached a conclusion. The date of his return has therefore been postponed. The details of the negotiations are still unknown. In addition, General Weygand, former Chief of the General Staff of the French Army (Chief of Staff of the late General Foch), recently came here from the capital of Iran and was received by the President.

<h3>Spain Disgusted with German-Italian Pressure; Italian Troops to Withdraw Soon</h3>
<p>(London) The Duke of Alba, Ambassador of the Spanish Nationalist government to Britain, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax today. It is heard that he provided new assurances to the Foreign Secretary that once the Nationalist army triumphantly enters Madrid on the 15th of this month, Italian volunteers will withdraw from Spain. According to sources close to the Foreign Office, there is good reason to believe that the Italian infantry units will all withdraw from Spain before the 25th of this month. It seems that those in the Nationalist government who advocate resisting the pressure from Germany and Italy have become increasingly powerful. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Duke of Alba, Ambassador of Spain, attended a banquet held by the British Advertising Association at noon today and gave a speech in which he said, "Spain hopes to revive its economy in peace, and is willing to establish close relations with all countries in the world, except for communist countries."

<h3>Southern Ireland Protests to Britain Against Conscription in Northern Ireland</h3>
<p>Dublin  Southern Irish Prime Minister de Valera said in parliament today that he has protested to the British government that the conscription law may be applied to Northern Ireland in certain circumstances, and hopes that the British government can handle it according to this protest. The Irish government believes that Britain has the right to conscript in Northern Ireland, because Northern Ireland is also a part of the land of the Irish nation. The Southern Irish MPs in the opposition party also support this attitude of the Southern Irish government. (Reuter, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Northern Ireland Prime Minister Craigavon arrived here yesterday and held talks with Prime Minister Chamberlain and Chancellor of the Exchequer Hoare for half an hour before concluding. He also made a statement, "The Northern Ireland Parliament passed a resolution last year, willing to allow the British government to use all its resources. Therefore, I reiterated this to Prime Minister Chamberlain today and asked Prime Minister Chamberlain to explain how Northern Ireland can best serve Britain." It is heard that Craigavon will hold talks with British cabinet members again tomorrow and return to Northern Ireland in the evening. In addition, John Dulanty, High Commissioner of the Republic of Southern Ireland in London, consulted with Éamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Republic, on the issue of the British implementation of conscription, and has now returned to London and will visit Prime Minister Chamberlain tomorrow. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Gafencu of Romania had his final round of talks with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano last night and is scheduled to return home today.

<h3>Hua Army Soldier Wang Shulin Steals Japanese Military Mail</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>Disguised as a Farmer, He Penetrates the Japanese Camp in Yueyang and Obtains Much Reference Material for the War of Resistance</p>
<p>While in Changsha, I heard the news that Wang Shulin, a soldier of the × Division of the Hua Army in northern Hunan, had penetrated the Japanese camp and stolen a large amount of Japanese military mail. Therefore, on April 2nd, I departed from Changsha on a journey to inspect the front line in northern Hunan, inquiring about the location of the soldier's unit, intending to interview him. Upon reaching Miluo, I learned that his unit was guarding the first line of defense on the south bank of the Xinqiang River. On April 10th, I arrived near the division headquarters of that division near the Xinqiang River, but he had just been ordered to depart for Yueyang to investigate enemy intelligence, and we missed each other. On the 16th, I finally met him in ××× on the south bank of the Miluo River. He had already completed his mission and safely returned with Japanese documents, boxes, and other items.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang has delicate features and a medium build. Dressed in black short shirt and trousers, he answered the reporter's questions calmly and logically. He was very humble in demeanor, but his movements and actions showed that he had received military education for many years. After completing his report, he still deeply regretted his lack of education despite his patriotic heart. I happened to have a Japanese spy book with me, so I especially gave it to him, hoping it could slightly increase his knowledge of espionage.</p>
<p>According to the Chief of Staff of the × Division, Mr. Wang is quite courageous and has a great ambition. Every time he decides to take action, he always aims to achieve other goals besides the original mission. He is adept at detecting counter-espionage activities when he discovers their espionage cells and is sure to eliminate them. He is truly a talented spy. Here is a record of Mr. Wang's conversation:</p>
<p>My name is Wang Shulin, from ×××, Yueyang. I am twenty-three years old this year. My father has passed away, and my mother is over sixty years old. She and my elder brothers and sisters-in-law are still farming in ××× to make a living, barely making ends meet.</p>
<p>At the age of fourteen, I graduated from a small school in my hometown and joined the Yueyang County Government Security Team as a servant. A year later, I officially became a member of the Security Team. At the age of seventeen, I felt that the future of being in the Security Team was limited, so I was introduced by a friend to the machine gun battalion of the Garrison Headquarters in Nanjing. In December of the Republic of China's 26th year (1937), this machine gun battalion was transferred to the command of the 51st Division of the Army. On December 13th, I was wounded in action near Yuhuatai outside the south gate of the capital Nanjing. I was treated in wounded soldier hospitals in Huanggang and Wuchang, northern Hunan, and returned to my home in Yueyang to recuperate at the end of January last year. By March, I had fully recovered. I saw that the country had reached this point, and there was no better thing for young people to do than to be a soldier, so I joined the Yueyang Regular Team again. In November of last year, the × Division was fighting in the Xinqiang area. Because I am a local, I was recruited as a plainclothes team member.</p>
<p>For the past five months, I and my comrades in the plainclothes team have often entered the enemy's rear in the Yueyang area to scout out enemy intelligence. I have been arrested four times, but I have escaped each time. My stealing of the enemy's military mail was an opportunity I encountered after my first arrest.</p>
<p>That was on January 9th. I was ordered to depart from the guerrilla camp near Yuanshaozhong Village to scout out the area near Yunxi Station, thirty or forty li east of Yueyang. I disguised myself as a farmer in Pingdi Quanjia, carrying a load of sweet potatoes and entered the enemy's warning line to the north. In advance, I obtained a piece of cloth called a "Good Citizen Certificate" (four inches long and two and a half inches wide, with the words "Identity Certificate" written horizontally on top, followed by sections for "Name," "Address," "Occupation," and "Age," signed by the ××× Self-Governance Committee). In addition to the committee's seal, there was a small oval stamp with "Naito" on the corner of the cloth). The enemy wanted to lure the people back to their hometowns, so they let me pass when they saw this cloth. Between the front lines of the enemy and our army, there were more than ten li where the common people were still farming. The enemy's general fortifications were not much different from ours, but the stronghold fortifications were mostly constructed with steel and concrete, and there were two or three layers of barbed wire outside. They could only be collapsed with artillery. They were well concealed, and it was sometimes difficult to detect them even up close. When I arrived at Yunxi Station, I was surrounded by a dozen Japanese soldiers. At first, they casually ate my sweet potatoes. Finally, a military policeman came and persuaded me to become a puppet soldier, and forced me to walk with him with a gun. The streets of Yunxi were close to the railway station. After walking a short distance, I was diverted into a city house. This house was also surrounded by barbed wire. As I walked in, I paid attention to the exit. It was a row of three rooms. He pushed me into the middle room and locked me in.</p>
<p>There were already five or six farmers in their twenties and thirties in the room. Everyone was both angry and scared, sitting on the hay. Although they did not know me, they expressed sympathy for my misfortune. Looking at the window lattices, they were not very strong. I thought that escaping might only be possible through this way.</p>
<p>I went in at a little after three o'clock in the afternoon. After five o'clock, another military policeman suddenly opened the door and called me out. He gestured for me to sweep the house for them. I happily picked up the broom. On the left side of the door, I smelled the sign of "Dai Nippon Post Office." I peeked into the window and saw many letters and paper rolls piled up on the long table in the window. I guessed it was a military post office. On the right side was the kitchen. I glanced at a shiny kitchen knife on the cutting board, seven or eight inches long and two inches wide, which looked a bit like a butcher knife. I cleaned it up and, taking advantage of the Japanese soldiers' unpreparedness, took it and hid it in my coat. Then, I let him lock me back in the middle room, giving me a small tube of polished rice with a small piece of rather fishy salted fish on top.</p>
<p>I silently hid the knife in the grass. None of the people in the room knew. Then, I sat near the wall, watching the gradually darkening sky outside the window, listening to the sound of the Japanese soldiers' leather shoes and horses' hooves. At the same time, with my hands behind my back, I used the knife to dig a small hole in the ground and buried the knife in it. When it was dark, the people in the room all fell asleep on the grass. Listening outside, the number of people walking had also decreased. I took out the knife in the darkness and began to slowly cut through the window lattice. It took me more than two hours to remove three of them, enough for one person to squeeze through.</p>
<p>It was eleven o'clock. Hearing the loud snoring of the Japanese soldiers, I jumped out of the window. At the same time, I decided that escaping after stealing the military mail was the only way to be worthy of the trouble. I walked to the window of the "post office," pushed it, but it was locked inside. I tried to pry it open, but it didn't move. The two large packages of mail on the table seduced me in the dim night. I gently broke the glass, then reached in and opened the window. I grabbed a package in one hand. However, I don't know if it was because I was panicked at the time, or because the long table was not stable, it "crashed" over. In this way, I only had thirty-six strategies left, and running away was the best one. I immediately strode out of the house, stepped over the short barbed wire door, and fled into the darkness to the southwest. The enemy's military police followed and chased after me. With the sound of a gunshot, the enemy hiding in the fortifications also blindly fired into the darkness, like the so-called "one dog barks at a shadow, a hundred dogs bark at the sound." After running three or four li, the enemy's bullets were still whistling over my head. At this time, I felt that the things I was carrying were too heavy (each package of mail weighed eight or nine catties) and I couldn't run fast. I decided to endure the pain and abandon one package. After walking another six or seven li, the dense gunfire fell far behind me.</p>
<p>So I rested for a while in the pine forest on the small mountain, and then slowly carried that package of mail back.</p>
<p>At dawn, I had to cross the enemy's newly built automobile road south of Yueyang. I saw six or seven sentries walking towards me half a mile away. I crossed without any concern. By the time they discovered me and shouted for me to stop, I had already entered the mountain forest on the side of the road. They chased for a while, but ultimately did not dare to chase into the woods.</p>
<p>Two days later, I returned to the division headquarters, presented my spoils of war, and reported the course of events in detail. That package of mail was wrapped in Japanese cloth. Inside, there were more than four hundred letters and dozens of newspapers and magazines. It was immediately forwarded to the higher-level military headquarters. Later, I learned that there was much material in it for us to use as a reference. There was also fresher proof of the enemy soldiers' war-weariness. Among them, there was also a list of wounded enemy soldiers in the troops fighting us in South Suzhou. In one battalion (according to the reporter, a Japanese battalion consists of four companies, each with more than two hundred and ten people, with more than seventy light and heavy machine guns, with greater firepower than our regiment), the number of wounded reached one hundred and fifty, not including those killed in action. The "Wuhan News," run by traitors, was also seen for the first time.</p>
<p>The division commander rewarded me with twenty yuan immediately. Within a few days, the military headquarters and the army corps headquarters also successively rewarded me with two hundred yuan each. I was also promoted from corporal to sergeant. I am truly very grateful. However, rewards and promotions are not my purpose for working. I only hate that I have read too little and cannot help the country more.</p>
<p>When I was in Yueyang, I often met the commander of the Tsuda Regiment, riding a foreign horse alone, holding a pistol, to the homes of our female compatriots that he had seized. I really wanted to find a way to take a gun and finish him off, but for a greater purpose, I have not yet received the order to do so. (April 7th, on the south bank of Miluo ××)</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Planes Attack Fuzhou Three Times in One Day</h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Bombs Dropped; More Than Thirty Shops and Homes Destroyed; More Than One Hundred Civilians Killed and Wounded; Losses Exceed One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In recent months, Japanese planes have repeatedly raided Fuzhou, attempting to exert pressure. However, the severity of the disaster has not been greater than on April 25th. The details of what happened are briefly described below:</p>
<p>First Time</p>
<p>On the night of April 24th, four Japanese warships sailed to the mouth of the Minjiang River and anchored at Nangan Tang and Mazu Ao. Among them was a large destroyer carrying four planes. Three planes took off at 7:05 AM on the 25th and invaded the airspace of Fuzhou. They circled the city once, first dropping ten bombs (three of which were incendiary bombs) in the most bustling Jiangbin Road in the commercial district of Nantai. The Xinxin Hotel, Huamei Soap Factory, Hualai Ginseng Shop, Tianyi Ginseng Shop, and Xiangkang Ginseng Shop, and Shangyuan Hospital were all bombed and immediately caught fire. More than ten people were killed and more than thirty were injured. At 7:50 AM, the plane</p>
<p>Second Time</p>
<p>At 8:50 AM, the three planes took off from the warship again and invaded the city's airspace, first dropping twelve bombs (three of which were incendiary bombs) on Jiangbin Road. The Pingan Silk and Cloth Shop, Caishen Silk and Cloth Shop, Hongfa Food Shop, Wanfu Food Shop, Baijia Su Guang Shop, Tianbao Jewelry Store, Baili Wine Shop, Zhaoxin Su Guang Shop, Longfu Money Shop, Baoyuan Rice Shop, and Taian Hotel were all bombed and immediately caught fire. More than twenty people were killed and more than fifty were injured. Then, three bombs (one of which was an incendiary bomb) were dropped in front of the Gulou (Drum Tower) in the city. The Huafang Photography Studio was completely destroyed. The Civilized Bookstore and the back of the Meihe Dim Sum Shop were bombed, killing three people and injuring more than ten.</p>
<p>Third Time</p>
<p>At 10:50 AM, the plane flew back to the warship. At 0:30 PM, the plane took off from the warship again and invaded the city's airspace, dropping two bombs on Hongwu Road in Nantai. The Yili Sawmill was bombed, killing nine people and injuring more than ten. One bomb was dropped at Wanbianjiao, with no deaths or injuries. Three bombs (one of which was an incendiary bomb) were dropped on the first dock of Jiangbin Road. The Xintai Warehouse was destroyed. More than ten wooden houses built by poor people from the north around the warehouse were completely destroyed. Five or six people were also killed and more than ten were injured. Then, three bombs (one of which was an incendiary bomb) were dropped on Shengfu Road, burning only three houses, with no deaths or injuries. At 1:30 PM, it flew back to the warship.</p>
<p>Total Losses</p>
<p>In summary, there were three bombings that day, with a total of more than thirty bombs dropped, all in prosperous urban areas. More than thirty shops and homes were burned down, more than forty people were killed, and more than one hundred were injured. The losses are estimated to be over one million yuan. The reporter went to the bombed area of Jiangbin Road at 3:00 PM on the 25th, but saw walls collapsing and houses falling, with piles of bricks and tiles like mountains. Everywhere smelled of burning. Corpses lay across the roads, some with broken heads and severed limbs, some with only half a body left, or only a torso with intestines flowing out, a bloody mess, a terrible sight. It was truly a great catastrophe. (April 26th)</p>
<h3>Tragic Situation of Japanese Bombing of Ningbo</h3>
<p>More Than 350 Shops Destroyed; Nearly 500 Men, Women, Children, and Elderly Killed and Wounded; Losses of Property in the City Amount to Five or Six Million</p>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: At 8:35 AM on April 28th, seven Japanese planes were spotted over Longshan Mountain. At about 9:00 AM, they invaded the airspace of Ningbo City, circling several times and scattering leaflets containing Wang Jingwei's two declarations. Then, they dispersed and wantonly bombed the newly built Ling Bridge, continuously dropping ten explosive bombs and four incendiary bombs. The locations where the bombs fell were: One bomb landed on the bridge surface of Ling Bridge, two bombs landed at the mouth of Yaoxing Street on the west side, three bombs landed on Binjiang Road (i.e., Banbian Street), three bombs landed in the Jiang River at Banbian Street and Datoutou, one bomb landed at the Huai'an Lane entrance of Ling Bridge Road, one bomb landed on Shiyi Zhen Juan, two bombs landed on Haohe Street, one bomb landed in front of the vegetable market on Ling Bridge Road, two incendiary bombs and one explosive bomb landed at the junction of Tingdong Houtang Road (i.e., the east side of Ling Bridge), and one bomb landed on Yanwu Street. A large fire broke out on both sides of Ling Bridge at one point, and it took four hours to extinguish. More than 150 shops from the Houtang Cold Storage Company behind the Temple of the Queen of Heaven to the Ling Bridge Road vegetable market and the Banbian Street area were completely destroyed. The biggest losses were the German Cold Storage Company, the German Xin Shihua Silk Shop, the Xintiankuan Silk Shop, and the Siming Bank Office. Five fishing boats parked on Banbian Street were destroyed, two were lost, and three were damaged. Four shops at the intersection of Houtang Road and Baizhang Road were burned. Six shops at the intersection of Zhongjie Street were bombed. Nineteen houses were destroyed and damaged on Yanwu Street. A large hole was blown into the bridge surface of Ling Bridge. More than 120 men, women, children, and elderly people were killed, and more than 270 were injured. They were taken to the Central Huamei, Renji, Tiansheng, Puren, and other hospitals by various rescue organizations. The highest military and political officials in the county supervised the rescue work in the disaster area while the Japanese planes were soaring. Shops and residents in the urban area were evacuated overnight. Ningbo, the commercial port of eastern Zhejiang, suddenly became a dead city. According to statistics, the losses in this bombing amounted to five or six million yuan. The essence of the city was almost completely destroyed. It is difficult to hope for recovery without three or five years of construction.</p>
<h3>Price Controls in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>Chongqing Establishes Assessment Committee</p>
<p>Chongqing Airmail: Prosperous commercial areas in Sichuan Province, such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong, and the counties of Wanxian, Yibin, Luxian, and Leshan, have developed significantly since the war of resistance. The prices of various goods have increased more than before the war of resistance, some even rising two or three times or four or five times or more. Daily necessities have soared even more. For example, a tube of toothpaste that sold for only one dime and four or five cents before the war now costs six dimes and five cents. The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently stated that although the high prices of goods are slightly affected by transportation difficulties and foreign exchange relations, there are also unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating prices, making a fortune from the "national crisis." If price controls are not implemented, the national economy and the people's livelihood will both suffer. Moreover, during the war of resistance, efforts should be made to stabilize the rear area. In addition to providing relief to factories and increasing production, the Sichuan Provincial Government was instructed to order all commercially developed counties and cities to organize price assessment committees to consider local conditions and formulate measures. All agricultural, mining, industrial, and commercial goods related to people's livelihoods are to be assessed uniformly.</p>
<p>Since receiving the telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Chongqing Municipal Government also received a hand-written instruction from Chairman Chiang to limit the high prices of goods in the city and adjust the supply and demand of daily necessities. Based on the "Measures for Assessing Prices and Eliminating Speculation and Manipulation in Extraordinary Times," the Chongqing Municipal Price Assessment Committee was established. The Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of all parties on April 21 to discuss and determine the scope and principles of the assessment. On the afternoon of the 25th, at 3:00 PM, the inaugural meeting of the Price Assessment Committee was held at the Social Affairs Bureau. More than twenty representatives from various agencies attended. The following resolutions were made: Regarding the goods that should be assessed in the city, in addition to the pre-war and post-war prices of newspapers, cotton yarn, white sugar, indanthrene cloth, and sheepskin, which have already been investigated, it has now been decided to investigate piece goods, grain, cotton yarn, Chinese and Western medicines, leather, shoes, and socks, and submit them for approval before assessment. It was decided to hold regular meetings every week. Each industry association was ordered to register the existing whole goods separately and complete the process by the 15th of next month.</p>

<h3>Youth Organizations Issue Declaration Commemorating Youth Day Pledging to Promote the Spirit of the May Fourth Revolution All Days of Life Are Years to Serve the Country</h3>
<p>Today is the 20th anniversary of the May Fourth Student Movement. The National Government has decreed that it is National Youth Day. Youth organizations in the city have issued a declaration, listing four key points, and swearing to the elders of the country to serve the country with all their strength. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Declaration</h3>
<p>(1) Our nation's youth have always been the most radical, enthusiastic, and sincere vanguard in China's national revolutionary movement. Recalling the revolutionary spirit of those years, which was unyielding and unbending, is not only an unprecedented page in Chinese history, but also greatly enhanced the political awareness and national consciousness of our nation's people. Thereafter, from the end of the political movement, more in-depth efforts were made to promote the new culture movement. Due to the widespread planting of revolutionary seeds, China's revolutionary tide, like the Qiantang River's angry tide, surged endlessly. Maintaining and promoting the revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth era is what our nation's youth must strive for every morning and evening and dare not slack off in the slightest. (2) During this period of resistance and nation-building, the difficulties and sufferings encountered by our nation are unprecedented in the history of our country for more than four thousand years. The heavy responsibilities borne by our nation's youth are self-evident. In the early stages of the war of resistance, we have already done our best to fulfill our national duties, but after careful examination, there are many areas where we cannot be complacent. Today, as the later stages of the war of resistance are rapidly unfolding, we must exert all our knowledge and abilities to die for the country. (3) The General Mobilization Outline for National Spirit and its implementation measures promulgated by our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, are the only weapons to win the final victory. Only when all the people of the country are united under the common goal of national supremacy, military victory first, and concentrated will and strength can we restore our land. Our nation's youth must respond to the call of the leader, earnestly implement the various items indicated in the outline. Even if this city becomes an isolated island and the environment is extremely harsh, the spirit of our city's youth will increase due to the adversity of the environment. It must be known that the May Fourth spirit was forged under the iron hooves of the warlords. (4) We firmly believe that there are two basic conditions for obtaining the final victory: first, absolutely support the supreme leader; second, absolutely support the national policy of resistance. Only then can the aggressors be completely defeated. Therefore, our nation's youth must do their best to reject Wang Ni Zhaoming and his cohorts, so that there will never be a day when national traitors exist on Chinese soil. (5) Today, as our city's youth fervently commemorate Youth Day, we solemnly swear to our respected elders in the country with sincerity. All days of life for our city's youth are years to serve the country. We swear to concentrate the unified will and strength, listen to the government's transfer and the leader's command, and sacrifice everything and fight to the end for the cause of resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>All members of the National Salvation Youth League in this city have decided to hold a national public oath today (the 4th), and send a telegram to Chairman Chiang to pay their respects. The original telegram reads: Chongqing Chiang Chairman Jun Jian, the May Fourth Memorial is to have my ambitious youth can not bear to sit idly by my nation's been bullied, and with the greatest determination and perseverance launched in the history of national revolution occupies the greatest glory of the national salvation movement, the members of the League, a youth's duty, the arrow diligence arrow courage, double the efforts, value this second phase of the war began, the spirit is heavier than material, I choose here youth revolution memorial day, held a national public oath, earnestly implement the spiritual mobilization promulgated by the Central, and the telegram Jun Zuo to pay tribute.</p>
<h3>The German Ship De Ping Arrives This Morning; Ningbo Bombed Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, five Japanese planes dropped more than ten bombs. The Shanghai-Dinghai line has resumed, but the Dinghai-Ningbo line is still closed. The ship Gao Deng was once out of contact.</p>
<p>From You County, 2nd: At approximately 9:00 AM this morning, five Japanese seaplanes invaded Ningbo airspace from the direction of Longshan and bombed extensively, destroying more than twenty city houses, including the Central Hospital, resulting in over twenty casualties. Simultaneously, three Japanese warships shelled the Chinese side outside Zhenhai port with more than ten rounds.</p>
<p>The Italian merchant ship De Ping, belonging to the Chinese-Italian Company, was hired by the Ningbo Association on the first of this month to transport a large quantity of medical supplies, doctors, and nurses to Ningbo for emergency relief. On the morning of the second, it arrived seven miles outside Zhenhai port at the place of Qilishi. However, encountering Japanese warships shelling Zhenhai port, it could not enter. Upon receiving the news, the Ningbo Association telegraphed for it to turn back. The ship left Qilishi at 10:00 PM the night before and returned to Shanghai. It entered the Wusong port at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Japanese soldiers boarded for inspection, which was completed at 6:00 PM. It could have entered the Huangpu River, but due to the evening curfew, it could not enter and had to wait until 6:00 AM this morning to arrive at the dock. At 8:00 PM last night, the Ningbo Association sent a telegram to the ship to express their appreciation. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "To Mr. Mu Zixiang and all the doctors and nurses, as the waters are under curfew tonight, it is not convenient to come ashore. We will send someone to meet you at the dock tomorrow morning. First, we send our gratitude. Ningbo Association, Yu Hede, etc., respectfully bow."</p>
<p>Ningbo City Was Bombed Again Yesterday</p>
<p>After being bombed by Japanese planes on the 18th of last month, Ningbo was bombed again on the first of this month. The deaths, injuries, and damage were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Unexpectedly, at 10:10 AM yesterday morning, Ningbo was bombed again. At that time, five Japanese planes dropped more than ten bombs. The Central Hospital on County Front Street and the building next to the Money Industry Association on Jianchuan Street were bombed. Details of deaths, injuries, and damage are not yet reported in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yin County Reports on the Bombing Disaster</p>
<p>Regarding the bombing situation on the 28th of last month and the 1st of this month, Yin County Magistrate Chen Baolin reported to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, saying, "To the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, we received your telegram. We are deeply grateful for your concern for your hometown. Upon investigation, the bombing of Ningbo has resulted in more than 130 deaths, more than 110 serious injuries, and more than 100 minor injuries. People who fell into the water or were buried in the fire field and rubble are still being excavated. More than 1,000 houses and 14 civilian boats of various sizes were destroyed. The eastern part was bombed again in the areas of Jiangdong Dajiaochang, Xinhetou, Hui Street, Da Daijia Lane, Baizhang Street, and Lingqiao Men and Jiuru Lane. More than 40 people died, more than 100 were injured, and more than 1,100 houses were destroyed. Special report, Chen Baolin, Winter."</p>
<p>Also, the General Affairs Office of the Shanghai YMCA sent a letter saying, "Regarding the current receipt of a telegram from a certain country in Ningbo reporting the bombing situation in Jiangdong on the 2nd, it is estimated that 1,000 street houses were destroyed in the bustling market of the Lingqiao area in Jiangdong, more than 500 people were killed or injured, and the loss was several million. The YMCA is safe and has been providing rescue. Please forward this information to all the newspapers. Special report."</p>
<p>People of Ningbo Donate to Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Since the bombing of Ningbo, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, at the request of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, decided to raise funds to help the bombed compatriots. After the news spread, people from Ningbo in Shanghai have been donating automatically, sending money to the association in an endless stream, amounting to several thousand yuan. The association has entrusted the Siming, Dalai, Huizhong, Hengli four banks, Fuyuan and Jianchang two money shops to collect the donations. An announcement will be published to widely encourage donations from compatriots.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Dinghai Route Resumes Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-Dinghai route was approved to resume by the Ningbo Defense Command, the German Far East Company's Hana ship, originally scheduled to depart directly from Shanghai to Dinghai at 4:00 PM on the 2nd, temporarily decided to postpone the sailing for the sake of caution due to the detention of the German ship De Ping by Japanese warships. It was decided to postpone the sailing and wait for De Ping to be released and return to Shanghai before sailing to Dinghai. Therefore, the ship schedule advertisement was changed to 4:00 PM on the 3rd. By 5:00 PM last night, as there was news of De Ping's release, and passengers had boarded and goods had been loaded, the ship departed directly from Shanghai to Dinghai at 5:00 PM. It was not inspected when passing through Songkou. It is heard that Haifu will sail to Dinghai tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Dinghai-Ningbo Route is Temporarily Cut Off</p>
<p>The foreign ships approved by the Ningbo Defense Command to sail the Ningbo-Dinghai route include the Portuguese Zhengde Company's Libao ship, the German Schneider Shipping Company's Tianbao ship, and the German Rulin Shipping Company's Gao Deng ship. Now, the Libao and Tianbao ships have been detained by Japanese warships and forced to sail to Shanghai, where they are docked at the Yangshupu buoy. Negotiations are underway by the Portuguese and German consuls but have not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Gao Deng Once Lost Contact</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was widely rumored that the Gao Deng ship of the German Rulin Shipping Department was detained by Japanese warships on the Chuanshan waters. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the ship's radio communication with the Shanghai company had indeed been cut off from 4:00 PM on the 30th of last month. However, from this morning, it has been able to communicate normally. The ship is now docked in Dinghai, and the Ningbo-Dinghai line is temporarily suspended. When the ship's radio could not communicate with Shanghai, it was clearly a time when it lost freedom of movement.</p>
<h3>Pudong Residents Understand the Greater Good</h3>
<p>Puppet Regime Forced to Promote Anti-British Sentiment; Residents Show No Sympathy</p>
<p>The puppet "North District (i.e., Gaoqiao) District Office" in Pudong was forced to summon laborers from various townships such as Gaomiao, Dongjing, and Laoshusha to hold an anti-British rally at the Gaoqiao Public Stadium on Labor Day, distributing various anti-British slogans and pamphlets. At 2:00 PM, more than a hundred laborers gathered, parading through the streets in formation. At the head was a white cloth banner with the nine characters "New Shanghai Labor Anti-British Rally." Following were people holding five-colored flags and small flags with anti-British slogans. After the parade, the group dispersed. However, businesses, due to the extremely harmonious Sino-British relations, showed no sympathy.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow, May 5th, All Sectors Fly Flags in Commemoration; Announcements from Both Concessions' Taxpayer Associations</h3>
<p>Tomorrow, May 5th, is the anniversary of the Kuomintang's appointment of a Grand President. According to the agreed date for citizens in the concessions to fly flags, jointly decided by various military and major groups in the city, all exhibition halls, groups, and shops should fly flags for one day to commemorate the event. The Public Concession and the French Concession will handle this in the same way. It is heard that the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession issued an announcement yesterday, listing the eight days of the year agreed upon for flying flags and informing citizens. May 5th is one of the eight days. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession also issued a separate announcement yesterday, informing that flags will be flown tomorrow to show unity.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry to Meet Tomorrow; Exert Efforts to Maintain Price Limits</h3>
<p>More Than 600,000 Bags of Rice in Stock; There is No Need to Loosen Price Limits</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Rice Industry Group Valuation Committee resolved to persuade and unblock sources to prevent prices from exceeding the limits, they sent a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday, asking them to properly plan strategies to balance market prices. The Market Management Committee yesterday invited various firms and wholesalers to urge them to strictly maintain price limits and prohibit under-the-table transactions. The Bean and Rice Industry Association announced that a joint meeting of various rice industry groups would be held tomorrow. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Request for Prompt and Proper Planning</p>
<p>The Rice Industry Group Valuation Committee sent a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday, stating, "Regarding the recent under-the-table transactions of high-quality japonica rice exceeding the price limits, and the price of Yangjian rice far exceeding the limits, how to find a way to suppress it is an urgent matter. Therefore, the committee convened a meeting on May 1st, which agreed that although the source of rice and inventory have decreased recently, leading to rising prices, there are still more than 610,000 bags of rice in stock for the most recent two crops, and there is no immediate cause for panic. All wholesalers should be earnestly urged to consider the food needs of the people and exert efforts to unblock sources, and must not exceed the price limits. At the same time, the Bean and Rice Industry Association should promptly convene a meeting of rice industry groups to jointly discuss proper strategies to balance market prices, etc. The resolution is recorded. A special letter is sent to inform you, and we hope you will follow the instructions. We are eagerly awaiting your response."</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Rice Groups</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association sent a letter to the Changshu Rice Association, Nanbang Association, Rice Sales Industry, Rice Shop Industry, Rice Milling Industry, and Shanghai Northern Rice Wholesalers Association, stating, "Our association is scheduled to convene a joint meeting of representatives of various rice industry groups at 3:00 PM on May 5th (Friday) at the Grain Exchange, 2nd floor, 15 Avenue Edward VII to jointly discuss important matters. We hope that the representatives of your association will attend the meeting at that time. We are eagerly awaiting your response." Also, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with a rice industry leader yesterday, who said that as of the end of April, the two concessions in Shanghai had 611,153 bags of rice in stock, which is a decrease of 41,303 bags compared to the previous period, but the inventory is still sufficient, and there is no shortage of food for the people. There is no need to immediately loosen the price limits.</p>
<p>Unblock Sources, Prohibit Under-the-Table Transactions</p>
<p>In view of the fact that high-quality japonica rice and Yangjian rice have exceeded the price limits and under-the-table transactions have occurred in the market, the Bean and Rice Industry Market Management Committee invited various firms and wholesalers to a meeting at the market at 11:00 AM yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Management Committee member Fu Qian'geng, who urged them to strictly maintain the price limits (No. 1 white rice is 14 yuan per stone, others are priced accordingly), prohibit under-the-table transactions in the market, and make every effort to unblock sources to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Jinan Incident; All Sectors Support National Policy</h3>
<p>City Residents Strengthen Their Determination to Resist Japan to Achieve Victory, National Reconstruction, and Avenge National Humiliation</p>
<p>Yesterday was the 11th anniversary of the Jinan Incident. All sectors of the city solemnly commemorated the event. All sectors believed that the Jinan Incident was caused by the invaders hindering the progress of revolutionary forces eleven years ago and maintaining the last tool of aggression, the remnants of the warlords. Fortunately, the Supreme Leader took a detour north and still completed the unification cause. Now, the sacred war of resistance is actively unfolding, and the realization of national liberation and national independence is not far away. All citizens of the city unanimously support the national policy and strengthen their will to resist Japan to achieve victory, national reconstruction, and avenge national humiliation.</p>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that today (the 3rd), in several shops and residences in the Public Concession, the Chinese national flag was flown in commemoration of the Jinan Incident. The police asked them to take it down, and most complied. This is because the authorities and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association have agreed on eight days for flying the national flag, and today is not one of them. There were many flags flown on Đồng Bằng Sông Cửu Long Road, including eight women's underwear shops that refused to take down the national flag, saying that they would fly the national flag every year on this day. Seeing that they would not comply, the police summoned a large number of reserve police officers, a red security vehicle, and three trucks of White Russian merchants. After arriving, they circled the area and then told the eight shop owners to take down the flags again. The shop owners refused again, and the police took them to the Chengdu Road Police Station. There was no conflict at the time. At the police station, the eight shop owners were told that they would be released if they took down the national flags. Soon, the flags were taken down, and the security vehicle and White Russian merchants also left. The turmoil subsided.</p>
<h3>Japanese Freighter Suddenly Catches Fire</h3>
<p>Severe Internal Damage</p>
<p>The China Press reported that yesterday (the 2nd), the Japanese-language Continental News reported that the Japanese Yusen Kaisha freighter Loshan Maru (phonetic translation) caught fire and burned severely while docked at the Yangshupu wharf on Sunday evening. It is believed that the fire was caused by Chinese arson. The fire was discovered on board at 7:00 PM that evening, but the swift action of the crew prevented the fire from spreading and was soon extinguished. At around 11:30 PM that night, another fire broke out. Although the fire brigade tried their best to control it, the fire had spread throughout the ship. It was not until after 1:00 AM that the fire could be controlled. The ship was burned and damaged and could not sail. The Japanese military police and consular police immediately began investigating, believing that the person who set the fire was on board. The ship employed a large number of Chinese sailors, and the fire broke out while it was docked, indicating that it was the work of an arsonist.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attacking Tangwan Disarmed and Expelled</h3>
<p>Songhu Guerrillas Inflict Heavy Casualties on Japanese Troops; Japanese Troops on the Shanghai-Nanjing Line Rush to Build Fortifications</p>
<p>More than 30 Japanese Marines, traveling from the Shanghai-Minhang Road through Beiqiao, intended to advance to Tangwan to attack the guerrillas. However, the guerrillas had received a tip and were scattered in civilian houses in time. The Japanese soldiers arrived at the town, and not seeing any signs of the guerrillas, they suspected that the guerrillas had been intimidated by the "Imperial Army" and had fled to other places. So they marched in single file, and when they reached the vicinity of Tangwan Elementary School, the guerrillas surrounded them from all sides. The Japanese soldiers realized they had been ambushed, but it was too late. They struggled to resist, but they were no match and had to abandon their weapons and ask for help. The guerrillas confiscated the Japanese troops' weapons and then expelled the unarmed Japanese, without killing them.</p>
<p>Songhu Area Guerrilla News of Victory</p>
<p>At about 1:00 PM on the 25th of this month, Japanese troops used four motorboats to transport more than 80 soldiers, who landed from the direction of Yaqian to a certain place where the Independent Brigade of the Songhu Guerrillas was stationed. When they approached the brigade headquarters, the brigade had already heard the sound of the motorboats and deployed in the trenches. A firefight immediately broke out. The gunfire was intense. During the heat of the battle, two more motorboats arrived, loaded with ammunition and more than 60 Japanese soldiers, who landed behind the brigade and attacked from both sides. The brigade was forced to move north to avoid the attack, and they re-engaged in a bloody battle at a certain place east of Langxia. The first and second companies were responsible for the frontal attack, while the brigade commander personally led the third company to encircle the enemy from behind. At this time, the 45th Brigade of the National Army also sent a team to provide support, boosting morale. Regardless of officers or soldiers, they all charged forward fearlessly. The shouts of killing shook the sky, and the bullets rained down. More than 40 Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot, and 60 to 70 were seriously injured. Just as they were about to completely annihilate the remaining Japanese troops, more than 300 Japanese reinforcements arrived on eight motorboats and broke into the third company's position. It was getting late, and the enemy outnumbered them. They defended their positions and stopped advancing. The Japanese also dared not engage in a prolonged battle, and they collected the corpses and wounded soldiers, loaded four motorboats, and retreated towards Jinshan. According to reports, this battle lasted for more than ten miles and lasted for four hours. The guerrillas only lost one soldier and two were wounded. The soldier who died, Shao Weiwen, initially suffered a gunshot wound to the chest. He filled the wound with bean leaves and continued to fight. He engaged in hand-to-hand combat again, killing one Japanese soldier before sacrificing himself heroically under the bayonet due to exhaustion. The Japanese troops, with a force of four to five hundred, fled and even snatched civilian clothes from farmers to escape.</p>
<h3>Japanese Build Fortifications on Shanghai-Nanjing Line</h3>
<p>Japanese troops along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway have been building defensive fortifications and rushing to build gun emplacements in recent days, which is extremely tense. They are also building a large-scale blockhouse and an anti-aircraft platform each in the Qingyang Port area. Yesterday (the 2nd), three military trucks carrying sand, gravel, and steel bars were transported from the North Station, along with a team of Japanese engineering soldiers, to rush the construction. According to the Japanese side, the project will be completed in one month.</p>
<h3>China Industrial Association Collects National Product Samples</h3>
<p>Prepared to Send to Southeast Asia for Exhibition to Promote Domestic Products</p>
<p>After receiving the notification from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to collect national product samples for exhibition in Southeast Asia, the China Industrial Association sent letters to various manufacturers asking them to send national product samples with prices marked to the association for shipment to Southeast Asia for exhibition. To understand the facts, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited the person in charge of the association and asked about everything. The reply was as follows: The decision to send national products abroad for exhibition was at the request of the Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce in Malaya to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. From the association's perspective, it should do its best to fulfill its long-standing responsibility to promote domestic products. Since the announcement was issued, the response to send national products to the association for shipment to Southeast Asia for exhibition has been enthusiastic. However, the association's review of the submitted goods is very strict to ensure that compatriots who love domestic products do not feel disappointed.</p>

<h3>Difficult for Puppet "Huaxing Bank" Currency to Be at Par with Legal Tender; Difficult to Obtain Unlimited Foreign Exchange; Observations from Foreign Bankers</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that yesterday (the 2nd), it was rumored that the currency issued by the Huaxing Commercial Bank, which is managed by puppets, is circulating in large quantities in Hongkou and Yangshupu. No traces of it have been found south of the Suzhou River. Foreign bankers still believe that it will not be easy to implement the bank's guarantee to keep the new currency at half the price of the legal tender and to obtain unlimited foreign exchange with the new currency.</p>
<p>A well-known foreign banker told the reporter on Sunday that the only way for the new bank to keep its promise is to implement export restrictions similar to those implemented by the Japanese authorities in North China. Yesterday, another banker said that it should be known that Shanghai's situation is very different from that of North China. It is doubtful that the Japanese side will implement export restrictions here. He also believes that the currency issued by the bank, no matter how strong its support may be imagined at present, has no chance of success under these circumstances. Also, a Chinese banker said that they know nothing about the Huaxing Bank except what they have seen in the newspapers. Also, The China Times reported that the Huaxing Commercial Bank, jointly established by China, Japan, and Taiwan, was established here on Sunday, but its currency is still piled up in the basement.</p>
<p>Last night (the 2nd), the bank personnel ridiculed the claim in a certain local English-language evening newspaper yesterday that the new "Hongkou" currency had appeared. They claimed that the bank has not yet started business, so there is no currency circulating outside. It is scheduled to open on May 10th or slightly later.</p>
<h3>Why Are Tax Stamps Not Affixed to Business Invoices?</h3>
<p>Should Pay Attention to Correction When Shopping; A Case Reported by a Newspaper Reader</p>
<p>Our newspaper received a letter last night from a reader in this city, Shi Zhihua, the content of which is the disclosure of a minor dispute arising from the omission of tax stamps on the invoice issued by a store, Jiyuan. On the surface, it seems to be a trivial matter, but the content is related to the entire national tax revenue. Therefore, we will disclose the letter below and hope that all business people will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Your time is extremely valuable, and I originally did not want to disturb you. However, in my opinion, this matter is also very important, so I have to bother you. Please take a minute to listen to me. At 6:10 PM on the first of this month, I went to a record company to purchase a record for a friend, priced at 2 yuan and 75 cents. I paid with a 5 yuan bill. When they gave me back 2 yuan and 25 cents, there was no invoice. I was told that all stores selling goods for more than one yuan must affix tax stamps and have invoices, and since I was purchasing for a friend, it was even more appropriate to have an invoice. When I asked for one, the clerk said, "Do you still want an invoice?" It was clear that they intended to omit the tax stamps. Because I insisted, they soon handed me an invoice, but instead of tax stamps, there was a blue square stamp with the words "Tax stamps should be affixed, the post office has stopped selling them, and there is no way to pay." Since the tax stamps had already been issued, I immediately asked why they were still using this stamp instead of affixing tax stamps. The clerk claimed that they could not purchase them. I argued with them, but they unreasonably defended themselves. Later, they even threatened me, saying, "We can't buy tax stamps. If you can buy them, you can go buy them with me." I insisted on not buying the goods unless tax stamps were affixed, and I asked them to refund the money, but they refused. Therefore, the argument lasted for a long time. Two other customers also joined the protest and argued with them. More and more people gathered. Later, another clerk affixed a two-cent tax stamp to the invoice and handed it to me. Only then did the commotion subside. All the other customers left empty-handed. I believe that tax stamps are a merchant's obligation to pay taxes to the country. Although sales in this city were once suspended, they have long since been issued. I believe that this merchant intentionally omitted tax stamps. Although it is only two cents, I am afraid that this is not the only case, nor is it the only store. This matter concerns national tax revenue. Although one or two cents is a small amount, but small amounts add up to a large amount. If all the stores in this city follow suit, the national loss would be considerable. Moreover, omitting tax stamps harms the country, and this matter is easy to do and greatly benefits the country. I hope that all my compatriots will fulfill their duty to supervise the omission of tax stamps, so that the national tax revenue can be maintained in its integrity. I also hope that people in the community will punish those who omit tax stamps to warn others. I hope that your newspaper will not hesitate to use a corner of the newspaper to announce this matter so that everyone will know. Your newspaper is serving the nation, and I can also do my duty as a citizen. I would like to extend my respects to the editor of the Shen Bao. Sincerely, Citizen Shi Zhihua.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Ministry of Communications" Attempts to Seize Old Assets of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; Warehouses and Wharves of Weihai Company Also Included in the Property Rights to Be Taken Over</h3>
<p>The puppet "Ministry of Communications" of the "Reform Government" hopes to revive the former state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and has asked the Japanese to hand over the wharves and warehouses of the former China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in various ports along the Yangtze River to the puppet "Ministry" for takeover. In its plan, the four properties of the Shanghai warehouse wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company that the National Government sold to the American Weihai Company, namely the China Merchants Xin Zhan in Pudong, the China Merchants Hua Zhan in Pudong, the China Merchants Zhong Zhan in Hongkou, and the China Merchants Bei Zhan, are also included in the takeover. It is heard that the Weihai Company, which holds the property rights of the four Zhan, firmly opposes this. If the puppet "Ministry" tries to implement this plan, it will ask the U.S. diplomatic mission to negotiate with the Japanese side again to maintain its legitimate rights and interests.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Pacification Team" Suddenly Revolts</h3>
<p>Between Zhitang and Zhitang; Japanese Officers Escorting the Team Were All Executed</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been incidents of interception of military and commercial vehicles along the Xihu Highway, causing panic and anxiety among the Japanese. In order to "pacify" the Chinese troops along the line, on the first of this month, the Japanese sent a truck from Changshu, fully loaded with more than 20 members of the puppet "Pacification Team," escorted by two Japanese officers. First, they drove to Zhitang Station to search, but the local Chinese troops had already heard the news and had fled far away, so they gained nothing. They then drove the original vehicle to Zhitang Station. Unexpectedly, when they drove to the vicinity of Mengjiang Temple (between Zhitang and Zhitang), the puppet "Pacification Team" revolted, executing the two Japanese officers escorting the team and setting fire to the truck. Afterwards, they stripped off the yellow uniforms they were wearing, took their guns, and dispersed into the countryside. Later, the chief of the Zhitang Japanese garrison received the news and immediately sent a large team of Japanese troops to the scene of the incident to search, but to no avail. After this incident, the Japanese have been monitoring the puppet troops very closely, fearing that a similar incident will happen again.</p>
<h3>Pig Industry Yesterday Sent Letter to Concession Authorities Requesting Relief</h3>
<p>Appealing to Chinese Directors for Assistance, Restricting Market Prices to Maintain People's Food Supply</p>
<p>Over a thousand head of fresh pigs from the fresh pig industry were seized by the "Livestock Market" of Hongkou on May 1st. After serious negotiations with the shipping company by various pig businesses in the capacity of consignees, and a statement reserving the right to claim damages, the shipping company and others negotiated with the pseudo-market. It was only in the afternoon of the 2nd that all the pigs were returned, but they still wanted to add a fee of several jiao and fen per pig, which was resolutely rejected by the consignee pig businesses.</p>
<p>Yesterday (May 2nd) at approximately 5 p.m., eight train cars of fresh pigs, totaling more than 400 head, were seized again by the Hongkou "Livestock Market". They are currently considering countermeasures and plan to file a complaint with a certain authority if necessary.</p>
<p>The Japanese Chairman of the "Market," Matsuda Masuyoshi, and the Chinese Chairman, Shen Bingquan, also known as Sun Hongyang, had the association send representatives Gu Baoheng and others to visit Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Jiang Yiping, and others on the afternoon of May 1st, requesting assistance.</p>
<p>The requests were agreed to.</p>
<p>The association also sent letters to the Public Concession's Municipal Council Bureau and the French Concession's Public Works Bureau on the 2nd. The letter stated approximately: "Our association is the central hub of the fresh pig industry in the entire city, with two buying and selling markets located in the Public Concession and the French Concession. Since the establishment of the 'Shanghai Livestock Market' in Hongkou, it has repeatedly taken away the goods arriving from various businesses in our industry.</p>
<p>For example, on May 1st, over 200 pigs transported on the Yunhai Maru belonging to the Shanghai branch of the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, over 600 pigs transported on the Danhai Maru belonging to the Jie Xing Company, and over 300 pigs transported on the Mai Maru were all taken away arbitrarily by the 'Shanghai Livestock Market' upon arrival in Shanghai. Moreover, according to what the market proclaimed,</p>
<p>they would continue to take away fresh pigs transported by Japanese ships in the future. Investigating, freedom of business is a common practice in any country, and monopolizing commerce is prohibited by law. If the fresh pig industry can be arbitrarily monopolized, then other industries will also be manipulated. This kind of behavior,</p>
<p>carried to the extreme,</p>
<p>will cause the entire economic structure of Shanghai to collapse, or cause a major crisis in the security of the Shanghai Concessions. For the sake of respecting administrative authority and maintaining the food supply for millions of people within the Concession, your bureau should</p>
<p>seriously consider</p>
<p>finding a way to provide relief and seek benefits for the public, lest unlawful attempts grow unchecked. This would not only be fortunate for our industry alone. Therefore, we earnestly state the facts and request you to promptly take measures to maintain commercial stability."</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Maintain Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Routes</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese warships and planes have been constantly harassing and bombing the coastal areas of Zhejiang, causing the closure of various ports and greatly impacting the shipping industry. Regarding Fuzhou, although ships cannot conveniently enter the Min River, foreign ships still anchor at Mawei, loading and unloading cargo. However, the export of cargo barges within the river must wait until there are no Japanese aircraft bombing before they can sail out. It is now known that</p>
<p>the Italian Company's</p>
<p>Gran Patara, two ships, is waiting in the port of Fuzhou to load timber. Quanzhou and Xiamen are also still peaceful. At 11 a.m. today, the Taikoo Company's Xinjiang ship departed from Shanghai for Shantou, also stopping at Quanzhou, carrying a large amount of bamboo and grain. Furthermore,</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson's</p>
<p>Lishun ship is currently in Xinghua and will return to Shanghai from Fuzhou within days, arriving in port on the 6th. It is scheduled to depart again from this city directly to Fuzhou and Xinghua on the 9th. However, during this time of war, changes in navigation may occur at any time, and merchants will be notified accordingly.</p>

<h3>Demanding the Curbing of Anti-Japanese Sentiment, Japanese Side Issues Strong Declaration</h3>
<p>Two Declarations Not Sent to Concession Authorities, Only Announced at a Press Briefing</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the Japanese military press department announced two strong-worded declarations at a press briefing last night (May 2nd), demanding that the Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession immediately take steps to curb all anti-Japanese activities in the two districts. A spokesperson for the press department stated that these two declarations had not been formally delivered to the Municipal Council, but it was hoped that they would draw the Municipal Council's attention to the declarations.</p>
<p>Regarding this Declaration,</p>
<p>a reporter asked why, since this matter concerned the authorities of the two concessions, it was not delivered to them but instead announced at a press briefing. The spokesperson replied that protests had been repeatedly lodged with the Municipal Council, and there was nothing new. The declaration was issued now to draw public attention to the situation. The spokesperson mentioned the five demands made by the pseudo-"Mayor" to the Municipal Council and the Consular Body.</p>
<p>The spokesperson further stated that the Japanese authorities believed that recognizing the "Great Way Government" would not undermine the neutrality of the Concessions. The spokesperson also mentioned the government assassination cases in the two concessions. When asked whether some assassination cases had occurred in the "Great Way" area, the spokesperson replied that this was merely a proper excuse. He also stated that it was difficult for the Municipal Council to implement Japanese demands, but the two concessions were</p>
<p>a base for anti-Japanese activities</p>
<p>and must be curbed immediately. When asked whether the Japanese demand to curb anti-Japanese activities in the two concessions also applied to foreigners with anti-Japanese tendencies, the spokesperson replied that if there were such foreigners, they must also be curbed. When asked what action the Japanese side planned to take if the two concessions could not satisfy the Japanese demands, the spokesperson replied that there was no need to discuss that at present.</p>
<h3>Spanish Residents Celebrate Franco's Victory</h3>

The Falange Española of Shanghai supported Franco's form of government. Members of the society wore red and blue uniforms and went to the Italian Consulate General. When the chairman of the Spanish residents association, Le Beo, arrived at the consulate, thirty-nine members greeted him with a fascist salute and played the Spanish national anthem. According to a member of the Falange Española, the society was informally established seven months ago and only announced its official establishment yesterday.</p>
<h3>Car Accident Tragedy, Western Police Officer Can Now Speak, Police Personnel Have Visited to Interview, Report Drafted Based on Account</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported regarding the car accident that occurred on the night of April 24th, Li Li and a Japanese sentry died, Li Li's wife was injured, and Western police officer Wimsett of the Public Concession Police Force was also seriously injured. The doctor attending to Wimsett allowed police personnel investigating the case to interview Wimsett for a period yesterday morning (May 2nd). Wimsett is now able to speak. The press has not been able to obtain</p>
<p>the content of what was said.</p>
<p>The documents regarding the circumstances of the accident have been drafted and will now be supplemented with Wimsett's account. Due to Wimsett's weakness, those who visited him at the Country Hospital yesterday only stayed in his ward for a few minutes. It is heard that personnel from the British Consulate are scheduled to visit Wimsett today or tomorrow. It is also believed that Japanese authorities will go to the British Consulate today to request a representative from the Consulate to accompany them to visit Wimsett, so they can hear his account. Yesterday, at the Japanese press briefing,</p>
<p>various reporters</p>
<p>asked about the incident after the accident where Police Officer Samson of the police department was slapped in the face by a Japanese major in the waiting room of the Country Hospital. They asked whether the protest lodged by the Municipal Council had been received. The spokesperson replied that the Japanese Consulate had received the dispatch, but it had not yet been forwarded and was currently under investigation by the Japanese naval warfare team officer. At the end of the press briefing, the spokesperson gave each reporter a written statement containing the Japanese side's views on the accident and the slapping incident.</p>
<h3>British Warship HMS Cricket Arrives in Shanghai, Carrying a Large Number of Foreign Nationals from Hankou</h3>
<p>Will be Decommissioned with HMS Mantis Upon Arrival, New British River Gunboats Will Arrive in China One After Another</p>
<p>The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that the British warship HMS Cricket, carrying foreign nationals from Hankou, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today (May 3rd) for its final voyage, as the river gunboat will soon be sold and decommissioned along with its sister ship HMS Mantis. The two new British warships replacing them are HMS Grasshopper and HMS Dragonfly, which have already set sail. Two more new river gunboats will sail to China next year, and two older ships will be decommissioned. HMS Cricket arrived with HMS Scorpion, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Holt, from</p>
<p>Hankou,</p>
<p>carrying thirty-nine foreign nationals from Hankou. They were previously unable to leave Hankou due to Japanese restrictions on the movement of third-country ships and people. HMS Scorpion is scheduled to arrive here at 2:30 p.m. HMS Cricket towed a British naval oil barge and had to detach the barge's cable upon arriving at Wusong and enter the port slightly later. HMS Scorpion arrived in China several months ago to replace HMS Bee and serve as the flagship of the Yangtze River Fleet.</p>
<p>Novel Design</p>
<p>Although its net tonnage is lighter than that of HMS Bee, it carries more crew members, partly because it carries smaller guns. HMS Dragonfly and HMS Grasshopper are quite similar to HMS Scorpion. HMS Mosquito and HMS Locust are currently under construction in the United Kingdom and will be commissioned next year and also join the Yangtze River Fleet. The existing "Insect-class" river gunboats will eventually be replaced by "New Insect-class" warships. HMS Mantis is currently docked in the Yangtze River and will soon make its final voyage, as the crew of the ship and HMS Cricket are scheduled</p>
<p>to go to Hong Kong</p>
<p>and then take over the crew of the two new warships HMS Grasshopper and HMS Dragonfly, which will sail from the United Kingdom to Hong Kong. The two ships will arrive in Shanghai after exercises in Hong Kong, scheduled for June 14th or 15th. The "Insect-class" ships served in the Near East during World War I, weighing 625 tons each and carrying two 6-inch guns. They were subsequently</p>
<p>transferred to China</p>
<p>to serve on the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. Every summer, they could sail up the river to Chongqing. There were a total of eleven "Insect-class" warships, eight of which were stationed on the Yangtze River and three near Guangzhou. The British Yangtze River Fleet also had several smaller gunboats, all named after wild birds. British river gunboats are very numerous and are therefore commonly seen in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>National Music Broadcasting Concert Scheduled Broadcast</h3>

<h3>Truth About the House Collapse Tragedy on Luxiangyuan Road, Nanshi, Bride Marrying While Pregnant, Adulterer Secretly Causing Trouble</h3>
<p>At 2:05 p.m. the day before yesterday, a house collapse tragedy occurred at the Fuxingyuan Restaurant at 146 and 148 Luxiangyuan Road in the Nanshi refugee area, while a wedding ceremony was being held for Yongren Weng Axiao and Yu Yunxia. Sixty-two people were killed or injured. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Here is a supplementary account of the cause of the tragedy, as learned through investigation.</p>
<p>Usually Romantic and Restless</p>
<p>Yu Yunxia is 17 years old and from Suzhou. Her parents loved her dearly from a young age and did not restrain her. Pampered and indulged, she developed a romantic nature and had affairs with several men, gaining notoriety in the neighborhood. Recently, because she was pregnant, she could not stay at home for long, so she quickly chose a date to marry Weng Axiao. Who knew that her former adulterer would learn of the auspicious wedding date?</p>
<p>Harboring Jealousy and Secretly Sawing Through Beams</p>
<p>According to the North District Fire Brigade's post-incident investigation, the house was not old and there was no need to demolish it. It was found through investigation that someone had secretly sawed through the tail beam beforehand to vent their anger, causing the house to collapse and crush many people. After the bride was crushed to death, she was dug out from the rubble and found to be pregnant. The groom, Weng Axiao, was injured and sent to the Qinglian Street Glass Guild Muslim Hospital for treatment by the Fire Brigade. It is reported that Weng was injured in the leg and his eyeballs had popped out, and his injuries were quite serious.</p>
<p>Detained a Bean Curd Peddler</p>
<p>After the incident, the Nanshi pseudo-police bureau attached great importance to the case and thoroughly investigated the truth. From the occurrence of the tragedy the day before yesterday until the time of writing today, the pseudo-police bureau has detained a bean curd peddler who is related to the case and is currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Abusing a Maidservant, Six Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Lin Jiangshi, a Guangdong woman residing at 347 Tongfu Road, is 30 years old. Her husband runs a lace company, selling various Western-style laces. Last October, Lin Jiangshi's mother, Jiang Cai, obtained Jiang Qiuju, the eleven-year-old daughter of her fellow villager Chen Chufeng, as a maidservant. However, Lin Jiangshi was quite violent and would frequently</p>
<p>mistreat Qiuju, mercilessly whipping her with a rattan cane over two feet long, causing Qiuju to be covered in bruises and suffering beyond words. On the night of the 29th, she took the opportunity to escape, wandering along the streets of Xinzha Road, and was discovered by a policeman who took her to the police station and sent her to Guangren Hospital. An examination revealed that her back, arms, buttocks, and legs all had</p>
<p>blue and purple bruises, fresh marks from the rattan cane. However, because Qiuju did not know the address of her master, the police station sent her to the Jiliang Institute for shelter and assigned Western Police Officer Fangteer and Chinese Third Class Constable 1013 to investigate. On the afternoon of the first day, Lin Jiangshi suddenly reported to the Chengdu Road police station that her maidservant Jiang Qiuju had run away.</p>
<p>The police station, having received the report and investigating her address, arrested her when she turned herself in. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, charging her with abuse under Article 286 of the Criminal Law. During the interrogation, Jiang Qiuju, fearing Lin Jiangshi's ferocity, hid behind the lawyer's seat and refused to stand up. Only after the court ordered her to be brought out did she</p>
<p>testify to the beatings. When questioned, Lin Jiangshi admitted to beating the girl for stealing money. She hired lawyer Liu Yuhao to defend her. Judge Fu sentenced Lin Jiangshi to six months imprisonment for abusing a girl under the age of sixteen, and the girl was sent to the Jiliang Institute.</p>
<h3>Drug Trafficking Organization Busted on Glock Road</h3>
<p>Ring Leader Sun Bao Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>The French Police Department's Anti-Drug Squad received a tip-off the day before yesterday that 8 Xinminfang, Glock Road was a drug trafficking organization. After receiving the report, the police station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives at 9:30 p.m. the night before last to the address, immediately arresting the ring leader Sun Bao and Duan Guisheng, seizing 58 liang of opium, cigarette rolling paper, scales, opium lamps, opium pipes, and over 60 yuan in paper money. They were all taken to the police station and escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special First Court yesterday. Police lawyer Gu Shouxu presented the case, stating that Sun Bao had confessed to trafficking opium at the police station and therefore should be prosecuted for drug trafficking, while Yin Guisheng should be prosecuted for possessing drug paraphernalia. After questioning the two defendants, Judge Liao ordered them to be remanded in custody for a retrial on May 12th.</p>
<h3>Prosecuting Morphine Peddlers</h3>
<p>The well-known morphine peddlers Ah Xian and Ah Biao specialize in dispatching their accomplices to secretly sell morphine drugs in the Zhenjia Wood Bridge area of ​​the French Concession. Their daily income reaches more than 2,000 yuan, with huge profits. Their business is thriving and they are swamped with work. The source of their drugs is purchased from Hongkou. For example, a ten-yuan item can be sold for a hundred yuan. They have been in business for half a year, accumulating assets of more than 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. They have been wanted by the French police station. The day before yesterday afternoon, detectives arrested Xu Zugen (38 years old, Wuxi native) and Gu Fan (22 years old, local resident), two accomplices of Ah Gang, at the aforementioned location, seizing more than 30 packets of morphine. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. The police lawyer prosecuted them according to law. After questioning, the defendants confessed that they were instructed by Ah Gang and Ah Biao to sell drugs and that they earned one yuan a day. After verifying the confessions, Judge Zhang sentenced the defendants to two months of imprisonment each and confiscated the morphine.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Reconcile, Continue Cohabitation After Separation</h3>
<p>Zhang Mingde, son of Zhang Jingan, owner of Zhang Yande Pharmacy at the intersection of Laojiao Road and Nanjing Road in the British Concession, married Zhou. They have been married for nine years and have a son, Yongji, six years old, and a daughter, Shundi, four years old. The young couple lived together at 32 Xixiangli, Lalingde Road in the French Concession, a property owned by Zhang's family. Last summer, the couple suddenly fell out, and Zhou took her daughter Shundi back to her mother's home at 15 Zhili Road. Zhou and her children hired lawyer Xu Lin to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against Zhang Mingde's father, Zhang Jingan, for separation and maintenance, and for the return of dowry and other items totaling 14,400 yuan. The first instance judgment allowed the separation of the two parties, and ordered the payment of 3,000 yuan. The child was to be raised by the plaintiff until the age of ten, when he would be returned to the defendant, and a monthly living expense of 60 yuan was to be paid from December 8th of the previous year.

<h3>Two Russian Thugs Rob Vietnamese Constable's Gun, Vietnamese Constable Resists and Is Shot</h3>
<p>At 11:20 p.m. the night before last, Vietnamese Constable 522 of the French Concession Fushou Police Station was dispatched to be on duty at 17 Shijian Road Lane, behind the Dahua Hospital. Suddenly, two Russian thugs rushed up and tried to pin down the Vietnamese constable and rob him of his official pistol. The Vietnamese constable resisted bravely. However, the thugs, seeing that they could not achieve their goal, took out a pistol and fired a shot at the Vietnamese constable, hitting his abdomen, causing a gaping wound and causing him to fall to the ground in a pool of blood. The thugs then took the opportunity to escape. Afterwards, a Westerner passing by discovered the situation and reported it to the police station. The injured Vietnamese constable was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is heard that his injuries were very serious. The police station sent detectives to investigate and arrest the escaped criminals and bring them to justice. The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that an armed foreign thug shot and seriously injured Vietnamese Constable Niu Yingshangchu (translator) No. 53 of the French Concession last night (May 1st), which is a shocking development in the history of armed crime in Shanghai. The details are as follows: At 11 p.m. last night, the Vietnamese constable saw two foreigners with suspicious behavior in a side alley not far from the intersection of Baogian Road and Baidang Road and yelled out to question them. The two men did not answer. The Vietnamese constable approached and questioned them again. The two men suddenly grabbed the Vietnamese constable. The Vietnamese constable struggled fiercely. The foreigners took out a pistol and shot the Vietnamese constable in the lower part of his body, causing him to fall to the ground with serious injuries. The two thugs ran away, one of them dropping a large knife he was carrying. A foreigner living nearby heard the sound and came out to see what was happening and saw the Vietnamese constable lying in a pool of blood. He ran to Lafayette Road and reported it to another Vietnamese constable, who called an ambulance and sent him to the hospital. It was discovered that the bullet had exited from the back. It is heard this morning that his injuries are quite serious. The knife dropped by the thug was subsequently picked up by detectives and may be worth a clue.</p>
<h3>Russian Empress Ship Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong; Guide Frauds Tourists; Siblings Scammed During Tour; Main Suspect Go Hau Taken to Court for Interrogation</h3>
<p>A Chinese woman with American citizenship, Si San, recently accompanied her brother on the Russian Empress ship from Hong Kong, intending to go to Canada. The day before yesterday, the ship passed through Shanghai and, as usual, stopped for several days. Many passengers disembarked to sightsee, and He San also went ashore with her brother at the new customs wharf. Unexpectedly, six Cantonese people, including Huang Guoqia, who specialized in leading tours (commonly known as "pilots"), immediately approached them,</p>
<p>Offering to be guides, and took He and her brother to the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road for lunch. However, as it was full, they went to the Dasanyuan Restaurant across the street. While they were eating, Huang and the others began to boast that a famous Chinese medicine, "Liushen Wan," was very popular in Europe and America. Now that they were passing through Shanghai, they should buy some. After the meal, the guides led them to the Qianyuan Tai Pharmacy at No. 6, Lane 7, Sanjun Road, Yunnan Road, to buy Liushen Wan. At that time, Huang and the others even pretended to be passengers on the same ship, also going to Canada, and claimed that they had forgotten to bring cash ashore. Therefore, they asked for a loan of 28 yuan in legal tender. He San only gave them 14 yuan. Unexpectedly, the other five people, after receiving the money, made excuses and left first, leaving only Huang Guoqia to accompany them on their tour. When they returned to the new customs wharf, Huang also disappeared, and they realized they had been scammed. They immediately reported to the Laozha Police Station, which instructed detective Huang Yingjie to investigate. Huang Guoqia was arrested on the 2nd of this month when he returned to the Qianyuan Tai Pharmacy. He was taken to the police station, where he confessed the names of the five fugitives: Situ Bao, Zhao Hua, Zhong Chang, Liu Shi, and Wu Youkai. He was ordered to be detained and yesterday was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jian Xunjiu presented the above situation and requested an adjournment to continue the investigation. Subsequently, the complainant, Ms. He San, submitted a case statement detailing the fraud. When questioned, the defendant Huang Guoqia claimed that his uncle had an office in Shanghai. The other day he took the opportunity to buy Liushen Wan to give to his uncle, who would then reimburse him and return the money to Ms. He. However, because his uncle was not in, he could not return the money and had no intention to deceive her. Judge Meng examined the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Strange Corpse Found by the River</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, an unidentified male corpse was discovered on the riverside of the Yihua Shipyard in Pudong.

(It is rare to see someone wearing a long robe with straw sandals.) It was reportedly retrieved by the customs water police station.</p>
<h3>Man Drowns Himself in the River</h3>
<p>Around 9:00 PM the night before last, a middle-aged man suddenly appeared at the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession. After wandering around for a while, he climbed onto a pier boat moored outside the wharf. Taking advantage of the darkness, he jumped into the river and committed suicide unnoticed. Because it was dark, the boatmen tried to rescue him for a long time, but were unsuccessful. Therefore, the identity of the deceased is unknown. Only a hat and a few copper coins were left on the boat, and are now stored in the customs water police station, awaiting identification.</p>

<h3>Lunar Eclipse Last Night</h3>
<p>Firecrackers Set Off Everywhere, Crackling Sounds Unceasing</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 3rd) was the 14th day of the third lunar month. Before 8:00 PM, the sky was clear and the moonlight was bright. Around 8:20 PM, the moonlight gradually dimmed. By 10:00 PM, the lunar eclipse was complete. According to traditional customs, people set off firecrackers during a lunar eclipse. Therefore, around 10:00 PM, the sound of firecrackers began in the suburbs of Zhabei and spread into the concessions. Many people in various sectors inquired with this newspaper about the reason via telephone, and were answered one by one. Subsequently, residents in both concessions also set off firecrackers one after another, like a string of beads, and the sound shook the city. Many residents stood on the streets, looking up at the sky. The sound of firecrackers gradually subsided after midnight, and the moonlight gradually became visible again, slowly recovering. The reporter later inquired with the Xujiahui Observatory, which reported that the lunar eclipse last night was fully visible in this city. The lunar eclipse began at 8:23 PM and lasted until 1:59 AM this morning (the 4th), when the moon fully regained its light.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bar Association Rectifies Discipline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association, in order to rectify the discipline of lawyers, resolved through the Standing Committee to notify all members to maintain discipline. The original notification is recorded below: (1) Respected Sirs, Lawyers are specially authorized by the state to represent or defend people in lawsuits, holding one of the three important positions in the judiciary. Therefore, they cannot be compared to other professions. Any slight deviation from normal conduct may invite criticism. Although all professions can advertise themselves, lawyers should not openly solicit business. Over the years, this Association has notified all members that they must not publish advertisements soliciting business in newspapers or similar advertisements in other places. Even when representing clients to publish announcements in newspapers, it should be limited to legal matters and should not involve unrelated matters. Now, fearing that this may be forgotten over time, we are sending this special letter to all colleagues, hoping you will pay attention to maintain discipline. With utmost anticipation, we wish you legal success. (2) Respected Sirs, Lawyers are specially authorized by national laws to perform their duties. Their acceptance of clients' entrustment to handle or defend civil and criminal lawsuits is also based on the law, in order to fulfill their sacred mission. However, it has recently become common in newspapers for clients to publish announcements thanking the lawyers after the conclusion of lawsuits. This is truly ignorant of common sense. Fearing that this may become a habit and affect the discipline of lawyers, we are sending this special letter to all members for your information, hoping you will explain this to your clients, advise them not to publish thanks in newspapers again, and jointly reverse this decline. With best wishes for your health, The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Bar Association.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Respected Sirs, I read the section on "Local News" in your newspaper on the 3rd, which contained an item on "Fire at Robertson Road." The item stated "Fake Fire Truck Causes Disaster," which is truly shocking. Our Association has always been a business organization. For twenty years, we have been conscientious and dedicated to serving the local community. Beyond that, we have no background of any kind. Furthermore, the disaster yesterday occurred when our Association dispatched the second truck, not during a collision on the way back. Now, to be labeled "fake" for no reason is truly damaging to our Association's reputation. We hereby request a correction and hope it will be published. Sincerely, Caojiadu Fire Brigade, a business organization, May 3, 28th.</p>

<h3>Robbers Loot Restaurant Cash Register, Open Fire to Resist Arrest, One Robber Shot and Captured, Re-Interrogated After Recovery</h3>
<p>Li Hong, a native of Ningbo, 34 years old, together with Wang Agen, who is still at large, went to the Ouya Garden Cantonese late-night snack shop at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession to eat dim sum at 11:00 PM on the night of September 10th of last year. After eating their fill, Li and Wang approached the counter, claiming to be paying the bill. They pulled out a handgun, threatening them not to make a sound. They then pulled open the cash register drawer and snatched more than ten yuan in large and small legal tender that the shop had taken in sales. They fled out the door, and the shop employees shouted for them to be arrested. As Li and Wang fled northwest along Guangxi Road and Yunnan Road towards the border with the Sutongbang, Chinese constables Tang Yucai (No. 192) and Wang Jinting (No. 2079) of the Public Concession Police heard the alarm and helped chase after them. Unexpectedly, Li pulled out his handgun and fired a shot at constable No. 192 to resist arrest. Fortunately, he missed. Constable No. 192 immediately returned fire, firing six or seven shots, hitting Li in the arm with six bullets. Despite this, he still ran away with all his might, running a circle through the British Concession and returning to the French Concession, fleeing into the Taiyuanfang lane at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII West and Zilaihuo Street. Due to the extreme pain in his wound, he could not support himself and fell next to a garbage can. The French Police were notified and sent detectives to arrest Li, seize the handgun, and take him to the police station. The police chief found that Li's gunshot wounds were very serious and ordered him to be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, he sent the transfer order to the Second Special Court to postpone the trial until Li had recovered. Wang Agen escaped from the crowd at that time and has not been apprehended. Now that Li has fully recovered, he was brought back for investigation by the French Police and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Liao Yuan interrogated him, and the security office lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, prosecuting him on three charges: attempted murder, robbery, and carrying military firearms. Subsequently, the victim and constables No. 192 and No. 2079 successively testified to the robbery and resistance to arrest. Constable No. 192 also stated that the defendant aimed the gun at his chest when resisting arrest. Fortunately, he missed, but it was still intentional homicide. When questioned, the defendant Li Hong confessed that he lived in Nanshi. He picked up the handgun on the road after the National Army withdrew the year before last. Because he had no money to use, he intended to entrust Wang Agen to sell the gun. Wang invited him to eat dim sum, but unexpectedly, after eating, Wang had no money, and neither did he, so they robbed the place on the spur of the moment. When he fired the gun, he intended to scare the constables so they wouldn't chase him, and had no intention of killing anyone. The court examined the confession, ordered the arguments to be opened, declared the conclusion, and scheduled the sentencing for the 10th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>The Relationship Between Marriage and Physical Health</h3>
<p>Marriage is indeed a major event in life. Although some say: "Marriage will increase the burden," or "Marriage is the tomb of love," who can transcend this stage after reaching adulthood? People cannot be superheroes, so who would give up the happiness they are entitled to in life? Large numbers of men and women are bound to embark on the path of marriage, and this is the reason.</p>
<p>If marriage is truly for the pursuit of happiness, a vigorous and healthy man and a beautiful and graceful woman, once married, will naturally spend sweet days in an atmosphere of love, have children, and build a happy family. Happiness will be boundless. Furthermore, with the adjustment and encouragement of love, their lives will inevitably be fulfilling. Happiness and progress are interconnected, leading to a cheerful mind and a healthy body. Life becomes more optimistic. Therefore, taking big steps on the journey of life, marching forward with courage, will bring great benefits in both academic and career pursuits. Thus, marriage for a healthy man truly marks the beginning of his happy life.</p>
<p>However, if a man has engaged in masturbation and nocturnal emissions in his youth, or has indulged in excessive sexual activity after marriage, or has suffered from overwork, resulting in problems with his sexual function such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipated energy, infertility, or incomplete development, then even if he marries, he will not only fail to find happiness but will only increase his troubles. Because he has failed to fulfill his wife's passion and has wasted her youth, how can she not feel grief and indignation when the flowers are in full bloom, filled with sorrow and resentment! If she has a stronger character, she may even engage in extramarital affairs or file for divorce from her husband. Is this not something we often hear about? Therefore, for men who are physically weak, I advise them to postpone marriage until they have cured their hidden ailments. Because not only will there be no happiness to speak of, but their health will likely deteriorate further. Many weak men become prematurely senile after marriage, or even die young due to illness, becoming short-lived ghosts. All illnesses should be treated thoroughly and as early as possible, especially the aforementioned conditions. If treatment is delayed, it will inevitably lead to "losing the big because of the small." However, it is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep have been lost. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the best and most effective treatment for the aforementioned conditions is to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproduction Element). This agent can promote sperm production, nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and blood, and nourish the nerves. With continuous use, mild cases can be cured in about a week, and severe cases can recover to full health in two or three weeks. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Himi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Himi Tuo Shi Sperm-Consolidating Tablets) to strengthen the sperm gate and stop emissions, thus treating both the symptoms and the root cause, with even faster results. If patients can come to my clinic for electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other scientific treatments, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>Beautiful Breasts and Happiness</h3>
<p>—Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>What kind of woman in the world is the happiest? This is undoubtedly a healthy and beautiful girl, or a mother with clever children. A healthy and beautiful girl is welcomed everywhere, as if she is surrounded by a divine light. A mother with clever children, building a happy family, is like the owner of a beautiful and grand garden. Although she works hard, she has boundless joy!</p>
<p>But how can they achieve such happiness? According to physiological research, it is entirely due to the health of the ovaries and the vigor of metabolism. Because when the ovaries are healthy, the breasts will develop well, and the buttocks will also be exceptionally developed. Thus, the most mysterious curves of a woman can be formed. Due to vigorous metabolism, a large number of new cells are produced in the skin, muscles, blood, and other parts. Therefore, the skin becomes fair and tender, the muscles become plump, and the cheeks naturally become rosy. Such women are the flowers of the era, and their happiness is naturally boundless! However, if past experiences such as chest binding, masturbation, irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, weakness, or severe illnesses have damaged the ovaries, affecting breast development, then not only will they lose their attractive beauty, but they will also be disliked by men, and there will be no happiness! The only remedy is to immediately take the ovarian preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" for women. It can nourish the ovaries, stimulate metabolism, regulate menstruation, eliminate uterine diseases, and promote pregnancy function overnight. With continued use, not only can withered breasts gradually become high and elastic, but also haggard faces can become delicate and charming, enhancing beauty and health.</p>
<h3>The Causes and Consequences of Nocturnal Emissions</h3>
<p>—Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Masturbation is the worst bad habit that is unsupported by good people. Eight or nine out of ten cases of nocturnal emissions are caused by masturbation. In addition, excessive use of the brain or nerve stimulation, which causes it to lose its normal function, can also cause nocturnal emissions. In short, the reason why young people have nocturnal emissions, apart from suffering from gonorrhea and inflammation of the sperm gate, is mostly a sign of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Semen in the human body functions to promote developmental function, stimulate metabolism, and nourish the nerves. If excessive seminal fluid is lost due to frequent nocturnal emissions, the brain, spinal cord, sex organs, and nerves will be damaged. Symptoms such as brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, dissipated energy, and infertility will inevitably follow. At the same time, the developmental function will also be hindered, and metabolism will be reduced, resulting in incomplete development, short stature, and small genitalia like a child. There are also those who become sallow and emaciated, mentally depressed, and prematurely senile. Such young people are often sick and in pain. How can they compete with others in academics and careers? Even in the indispensable marital life, they will not be able to comfort their wives and will be hated by them! The family will suffer, happiness will be lost, life will be painful, the future will be hopeless, or even the lifespan will be shortened!</p>
<p>There are many methods for treating nocturnal emissions, but the most effective and targeted one is "Himi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Himi Tuo Shi Sperm-Consolidating Tablets). This medicine can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, reduce nightmares, and promote restful sleep, so nocturnal emissions will naturally be cured. It must also be taken in conjunction with the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. With continued use, full health will surely be restored soon. If patients can come to my clinic for electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other scientific treatments, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea Forum</p>
<p>—Written by Dr. Dai De, Gonorrhea Specialist</p>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Free Consultation, Only 4 Jiao Registration Fee</p>
<h3>Why Leukorrhea Threatens Reproduction</h3>
<p>Leukorrhea that threatens reproduction has now been resolved.</p>
<p>Those who are infertile due to gonorrhea are all overjoyed.</p>
<p>People generally believe that gonorrhea occurs in the urethra. Why does it have such a big impact on reproduction? Many think this is alarmist talk. But this is not the case. Human reproduction must have the following conditions: (1) An organ for producing sperm. (2) A source for nourishing sperm. If the organ that produces sperm is damaged, it will lose its function of producing sperm, and therefore sperm cannot be produced. A sperm is like a tadpole, swimming in prostatic fluid, which is the sustenance for the sperm to live. And the organ that produces sperm is the testicle. In the complications of gonorrhea, orchitis and prostatitis are the most common. Prostatitis is more likely to occur than orchitis. These two symptoms each have their specific effects. Prostatitis often becomes prostatic leakage if left untreated. A white liquid will escape from the urethral opening when straining during bowel movements, wasting the prostatic fluid. As for orchitis, if it occurs on one side, there is still one testicle that can produce sperm. If both sides are inflamed, reproduction will be hopeless. With my decades of experience, I use German "Xi Shi Blood Serum" and Le Zhi's prostate massage method, using the correct treatment for the symptoms. Furthermore, with German "Lv Lin Ping Liu" electrotherapy, penetrating the lesions to eradicate gonorrhea bacteria, all symptoms that threaten reproductive ability such as prostatitis and orchitis can be quickly treated, and reproductive function can be restored. I am confident and dare to guarantee it.</p>

<h3>China Youth Society - Message to Youth Commemorating May Fourth</h3>
<p>China Student Service - Initiates Ten No's Campaign</p>
<p>The China Youth Society was established on April 30th. To commemorate the May Fourth Movement today, it has issued a message to youth. The original text is very long, and excerpts are provided below. Dear youth, the May Fourth Movement is a glorious historical event created by us students and youth. From the May Fourth Movement onward, the entire Chinese ideological movement and cultural movement underwent a epoch-making transformation. The May Fourth Movement not only directly sanctioned the traitorous conspiracies of feudal warlords, but also nurtured a new enlightenment movement in Chinese youth thought. This is the beginning of the Chinese youth movement and the most tragic scene of Chinese youth participating in the revolutionary movement. Today, as we commemorate the May Fourth Movement in this tense stage of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, we feel its significance is even more profound. Because China's revolutionary movement has entered a new stage, from the anti-feudal stage to the anti-aggression stage. The participation of Chinese youth in the revolutionary movement is naturally closely coordinated with the wheels of this era. However, we must not forget the May Fourth Movement. We must carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement and create an even greater and more glorious commemoration. We must grasp reality and ignite the revolutionary fire in the tide of national revolution.</p>
<p>China Student Service Issues Declaration</p>
<p>To commemorate the May Fourth Movement, the China Student Service has launched a "Ten No's" campaign. The text of its declaration is excerpted below. Shanghai, in its corner, is often called an "isolated island." Hundreds of thousands of college, middle, and elementary school students are in a noisy and disruptive environment. Jazz music is played in dance halls, and salacious books are displayed in stores. What a grand spectacle! Furthermore, grotesque copies are shown on the screen, and sweet letters are transmitted by postal workers. As a result, some wear clean clothes and wander the streets, while others have dirty bedding and steal and hide other people's belongings. Some, driven by patriotic zeal, sneak into the interior to work, while others are exploited and pretend to join certain groups to diligently investigate various situations. In this extraordinary period, these are almost the daily lives of many students. The habits are deeply ingrained and have a great impact. Over time, they will cause endless harm. At this time of national survival, when the call to mobilize is high, frontline soldiers are entering and exiting the rain of bullets and are working hard to save the country. How can young students be drunk with life and dreaming of death, go astray, and continue to do this? The consequences are unimaginable in the future. An organization should be formed urgently to lead the people and be a model for the people. The Service has always been dedicated to serving the student community, silently observing the current social situation, and deeply knowing the advantages and disadvantages. It has launched the "Ten No's" student movement, hoping that students from various schools will abide by it, vigorously change their bad habits, do practical work, set an example, respect themselves, and make revolution the foundation of their achievements, and make loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace the principles of their lives. The country is fortunate, the nation is fortunate.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Student Community Spiritual Mobilization Association, the Shanghai Student Union, and the Suzhou Middle School Association, among others, also issued a letter to all students in Shanghai yesterday to commemorate May Fourth.</p>
<h3>Overview of National Higher Education Funding (II)</h3>
<p>National Treasury subsidies to provincial and private vocational schools above the associate degree level were previously limited to a small number of schools approved on a case-by-case basis. Starting in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), a special fund for subsidies to private vocational schools above the associate degree level was established. (Three points were noted during distribution and allocation: (1) Subsidies for practical subjects such as science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine should account for at least 70% of the total special fund. (2) 70% of the subsidies for each school should be used to expand equipment, and the remainder should be used to add faculty for special subjects. (3) Each subsidy is limited to one year, and those who violate the regulations at the time of approval may have their subsidies suspended mid-way.) The total amount of the special fund was initially set at 760,000 yuan per year, and was increased to 1.22 million yuan in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). Provincial schools were added to the allocation, and the fund was renamed the Special Fund for Subsidies to Provincial and Private Vocational Schools Above the Associate Degree Level. It was also decided to increase this special fund annually, and no longer give subsidies to a portion of schools based on special approvals. During the War of Resistance, the fund was reduced for distribution. 910,000 yuan was actually distributed in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). In the first half of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), 416,500 yuan was distributed based on the actual distribution in the first half of the year. From the 23rd year of the Republic (1934) to the present, the number of subsidized schools has increased from 22 to 46. The relocation expenses for the schools that moved to the rear were mostly paid by the schools themselves from their original budgets. However, a small number of schools that had to relocate over long distances had budgets that were too stretched. After special approval, relocation fees were subsidized, totaling 370,000 yuan from the 26th year of the Republic (1937) to the present. Teachers from schools in the war zone who lost their jobs were also given living expenses by the ministry to enable them to engage in editing and research work, at around 70,000 yuan per month. In addition, students from the war zone were distributed to schools in the interior for borrowing studies and were given travel expenses and allowances. After admission, they were also given living loans, totaling around 80,000 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Boxer Indemnity Funds</p>
<p>(1) The standard for the allocation of British Boxer Indemnity funds divides the educational and cultural undertakings that should be carried out into five categories. Category B subsidizes higher education research institutions, with a special emphasis on agriculture, engineering, medicine, and science, accounting for 35% of the total amount. In addition to subsidizing academic institutions and organizations, the subsidies for public and private vocational schools above the associate degree level were 275,000 yuan in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), 295,000 yuan in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), 755,000 yuan in the 25th year of the Republic (1936), and 1,305,000 yuan in the 26th year of the Republic (1937). (500,000 yuan of this amount was temporarily decided after the start of the War of Resistance to establish two temporary universities in the southwest and northwest, namely the current Southwest Associated University and Northwest Associated University.) In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), the amount was 685,000 yuan. (2) After the return of the American Boxer Indemnity funds, all of it was used for the development of education and culture. A portion of it was used for the expenses of Tsinghua University (including the school's expenses, overseas students, and university funds), and the other portion was kept and allocated by the Board of Directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation. A portion was set aside as a permanent fund, and the portion used to subsidize vocational schools above the associate degree level, in addition to the funds the society directly allocated for scientific professorships to universities in various regions and the establishment of joint lectureships with designated universities, was used to subsidize the construction, equipment, research, and maintenance expenses of various schools, amounting to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan per year. (3) According to the Sino-French Boxer Indemnity Agreement, the returned funds were used for Sino-French educational undertakings and were kept and allocated by the Sino-French Education Foundation Committee. The vocational schools above the associate degree level that received regular subsidies included Sino-French University, Sino-French Institute of Technology, Aurora University, and Tianjin Business College.</p>
<p>Funding Adjustments</p>
<p>The 26th year of the Republic (1937) saw a tightening of educational funding. In the 27th year of the Republic (1938), there were restrictions on continuing the funding methods of the previous year. In addition to the above, there were other funding adjustments worth mentioning: (1) 40% of the original budgets of Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University were transferred to form the Southwest Associated University. (2) 40% of the original budgets of Peiping University, Peiping Normal University, and Peiyang Engineering College were also transferred to form the Northwest Associated University. (3) 50% of the original budgets of the Peiping and Hangzhou Art Schools were transferred to form the National Art College. (4) The budgets of Shanghai Business College, Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Jinan University, and the Republican College of Sino-French University were each reduced by 60% of their original budgets. (5) The budget of Tongji University was reduced by 80% of its original budget. (6) A portion of the funds from the Northwest Associated University budget allocated for the engineering and agricultural colleges was transferred to partially fund the Northwest Institute of Engineering and Agriculture, as well as the relocation expenses of Northeast University. (7) A portion of the funds from the Northeast University budget allocated for the engineering college was transferred to partially fund the Northwest Institute of Engineering. (8) All the funds of the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry Vocational School were transferred to partially fund the Northwest Agricultural College. (End)</p>

<h3>Shanghai People's Dinner</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Shanghai people's breakfast is very casual and perfunctory, while Shanghai people's dinner is very particular and meticulous. Here, I can explain the reasons for this.</p>
<p>We know that the prosperity of Shanghai is not in the daytime, but in the evening. Once the lights are on, the neon lights illuminate half the sky, and the restaurants, dance halls, brothels, theaters, and hostels are filled with music and laughter, making you intoxicated and immersed! So every time at dinner time, people call their friends and go to restaurants. Those who are more economical eat snacks (although they are snacks, they cost no less than two or three yuan). Those who are more lavish eat a full banquet and large dishes. During the banquet, they guess punches, issue commands, drink heartily, and often when they are in high spirits, they call for a局to enjoy flowers, sing a song on the spot, or invite prostitutes to sing songs such as "Peach Blossom River," "Swallow Song," and "When Will You Come Again." The voices of the singers are so pleasant that they make you feel relaxed and yearning. But as the saying goes, "There is no banquet in the world that does not end." How much does such an evening cost? More than tens of gold? However, the quasi-Shanghai people who are surviving in the isolated island paradise, or the fake Shanghai people who have temporarily joined the group, are actually enjoying this and never tire of it.</p>
<p>A large part of this wasteful and extravagant dinner is the temptation of sound, color, dogs, and horses, which makes you lose your mind and have to go to the restaurant for a drink. This is vastly different from the simple foods such as bread, rice balls, or plain noodles that are stuffed into your stomach in the morning! Although it cannot be said that all Shanghai people are like this, at least it is not a small number. I can say with certainty that the boiling and crowded atmosphere in the restaurants, buildings, and large dining rooms is definitely not a formal banquet with proper things for every family!</p>
<p>Generally speaking in society: In general companies, firms, shops, and factories and other industrial and commercial institutions, every dinner is a full table, with rice, porridge, and rich dishes. Mansions and families are also like this. Only ordinary middle-class families eat some burnt rice or white porridge, with a plate of peanuts or preserved eggs, oily bamboo shoots, bright shrimp, etc. as side dishes, which is already very delicious. Why bother with chicken and meat every night, indulging in the pleasure of your mouth? So every night when I go home, a plate of vegetables and a plate of beans, or a lettuce, a bamboo shoot, a salted egg, to go with two bowls of thin porridge, I feel very satisfied and happy. Those who don't even have thin porridge to eat are the ones who are really suffering!</p>
<h3>Artificial Silk</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>The weather is changing from late spring to early summer! We just need to look at the people walking on the street, and they have changed into light and floating clothes. Following the gentle breeze of early summer, "wearers feel comfortable and happy." This is the power of silk. Chinese people like to wear clothes made of silk, but they will not make the manufacture of silk universally developed, nor will they reduce the price of silk. Therefore, this treasure of "artificial silk" has risen to prominence. Now, I'll talk about "artificial silk":</p>
<p>"Artificial silk" has only recently taken a turn for the better, but it was born in 1925. At first, no one paid attention to this thing, thinking that "artificial silk" was a toy, at most displayed in exhibitions for people to watch. Who knew that "artificial silk" itself had made progress - that is, "artificial silk" can be popularized among the people. The annual consumption actually exceeds that of silk by more than four times?</p>
<p>The raw material that makes up "artificial silk" is the leftover cotton from spinning. The cotton fiber is soaked in nitric acid to cause a nitration reaction, resulting in a kind of nitrated woven element. Then, it is dissolved in a certain solution to become a colloid, and then it flows out through a fine hole like a rice sieve, and it solidifies into a glossy fiber. After sorting, it becomes the so-called artificial silk, which is called Rayon in English.</p>
<p>Artificial silk has a wide range of uses, and like real silk, it is good for making fabrics such as satin and silk. Although clothes made of it are not as soft as silk, they are also very crisp. Items such as silk stockings, ties, and handkerchiefs can all be made of "artificial silk." The price is several times cheaper than real silk, so more and more people are using "artificial silk."</p>
<p>Recently, three new types of "artificial silk" have been invented: one called "water-resistant silk," one called "wrinkle-resistant silk," and one called "stain-resistant silk." They are really ingenious. Clothes made of "water-resistant silk" are good to wear as raincoats on rainy days. When water encounters this "water-resistant silk," it retreats as if it has encountered fire. Clothes made of "wrinkle-resistant silk" do not need to be ironed with an electric iron. When you compress the "wrinkle-resistant silk" into a small piece, it is an extremely smooth piece of clothing when you release it. "Stain-resistant silk" has a special point: its surface seems to be covered with a layer of glass. Wearing it is a good thing, you just need to shake it gently, and all the dirt will be immediately expelled and wiped out.</p>
<p>"Artificial silk" is constantly improving, and it may overthrow silk in the future. But all the products of this "artificial silk" are imported goods. We should pay attention. It is best to wear silk made of domestic silk to recover our rights.</p>
<h3>Train on the Desert (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Teadrinker</p>
<p>Not only that, but also because there are other means of transportation such as donkeys, mules, oxen, and horses in the customs during the day, traveling back and forth. If camels were to travel during the day, it would cause traffic jams on the road. Because every time a camel travels, there are hundreds or thousands, or at least dozens of them. If they were to go east on this road, then other vehicles coming west would not be able to pass. This is because the long snake formation they form is not easy to dodge.</p>
<p>Camels, as animals, do not walk very fast, but they have long-lasting patience. They can march all day long without fear in the midst of wind and snow. This spirit of not being afraid of hardship is not only inferior to other animals, but even we humans, who are the most sensitive and are called the supreme animals, cannot match them.</p>
<p>In the camel's procession, one out of every five camels must have a large bell hanging around its neck, and at least one person out of every ten must be sitting on its back. The last camel must have a particularly large bell around its neck that is also particularly loud. This is the pressure bell for pulling the camels. In other words, the camel pullers ride on the backs of the camels at night and don't have to worry about anything else, as long as they hear the loud iron bell behind them ringing, there will be no mistakes.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I can't help but say that camels are too stupid. As the saying goes: "Hemp rope pulls a camel." In their procession, each camel is strung with a hemp rope through its nostrils and tied to the back of another camel's camel frame. Because the hemp rope is extremely loose and thin, it is most likely to break. If the rope breaks, it will not stop and follow the team forward; so there must be a person at the front pulling them forward, so the ordinary camel driver is called: "Camel Puller".</p>
<p>It is said that the reason why thin hemp ropes are used to pull them is because camels do not recognize strangers. If there are any thieves or robbers who want to rob them, the camels will spit camel dung to resist strangers, so the hemp rope will break immediately. The camel pullers hear the sound of the bell is wrong, they will know that there is an accident and add to it.</p>
<h3>Pei Long (Carrying Basket)</h3>
<p>— He Lisan</p>
<p>The term "Pei Long (Carrying Basket)": seems very obscure. What exactly is this thing? I'm afraid most readers will be confused. Now let me introduce it to you. According to "Pei Long (Carrying Basket)" is a specialty of Zhuji, eastern Zhejiang, and is used as a means of transportation. The object is shaped like a festive box, but the box is made of wood, while this is woven from bamboo or rattan, making an oval shape, like a cradle for a child to sleep in. There is a backrest on top. This object is placed on a wooden frame, and a very long carrying pole is passed through the top of the frame. Two people carry it. When walking, the porters in front and behind make strange cries. People sit inside, just like sitting on a bed, with a cotton quilt underneath as a cushion. This is what is called Pei Long (Carrying Basket). Many households in that area have this thing as a means of transportation for their own families and for welcoming and sending off relatives and friends. When in use, two long-term workers are called to be porters. If there are no long-term workers in their own home, they can be called from neighbors or other places. The wages are very casual, depending on the distance of the journey, but meals must be provided. This kind of travel equipment is rarely seen by people from other provinces. When they see it, they will be deeply surprised, because the shape is very unsightly. Nowadays, rickshaws are popular in the urban areas of the county, and this thing is almost eliminated, but it is still popular in the townships!</p>
<p>Special Notice: Recently, many contributors to various newspapers have automatically transferred their manuscript fees to charity sales donations. Contributors to this publication who wish to participate, please indicate "Charity Sales Donation" at the end of the manuscript, and we will do so accordingly.</p>
<p>Errata: In the April 27th issue of this publication, "The Washing Problem of Clothes," line 12, "shallow iron pot" was mistakenly "shallow", line 20, "add fertilizer to the fields" was missing the word "with", and line 28, "漿衣之上" was mistakenly "用" as "其".</p>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Mrs. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Cabbage is also a very nutritious vegetable, whether it is cooked with meat or vegetarian, it can be said to be suitable for everything, and not only does it occupy an important position in Chinese cuisine, but it is also often used in Western cuisine. The most common vegetarian cooking method is braising. If you are cooking vegetarian delicacies, then you must use cabbage, and all the other ingredients such as gluten, fried dough sticks, bamboo shoot slices, fragrant mushrooms, and fungus are all auxiliary ingredients. As for meat dishes, the most common is to braise it with pork chunks, or stir-fry it with sliced meat and sliced bamboo shoots, without soy sauce, and the taste is very similar to stir-fried cauliflower with sliced meat. There is also a special cooking method, which is what I want to introduce this week, which is cabbage-wrapped meat. Finely chop pork and bamboo shoots together, add soy sauce, mix them together, and make patties. Then, take the washed cabbage leaves, one by one, and wrap a meat patty in each leaf, making it look like a dumpling, and braise it together. It tastes very delicious. If you like to eat beef, you can use beef instead of pork, which is also possible.</p>
<p>Monday: Cabbage with Meat, Yellow Croaker Stewed with Pickled Vegetables, Spinach with Tofu, Bamboo Shoots with Lettuce</p>
<p>Tuesday: Onion Beef, Sweet and Sour Braised Crucian Carp, Fried Dough Sticks with Greens, Stir-fried Bean Sprouts</p>
<p>Wednesday: Dried Vegetables Braised Pork, Shrimp Roe Steamed Eggs, Tofu Shepherd's Purse, Bamboo Shoot Skins with Vermicelli Soup</p>
<p>Thursday: Shepherd's Purse Pork Soup, Vinegar Glazed Large Yellow Croaker, Braised Cabbage, Jellyfish Radish Salad</p>
<p>Friday: Silver Sprouts Stir-fried Pork, Silver Fish Stir-fried Eggs, Fried Dough Sticks with Mustard Greens, Shrimp Roe Stir-fried Gluten</p>
<p>Saturday: Cabbage with Sliced Pork, Pork Stewed with Salted Pomfret, Tofu Lettuce, Pickled Vegetable Soybean Sprouts</p>
<p>Sunday: Curry Meat, Egg Drop Soup, Stir-fried Shepherd's Purse, Stir-fried Radish</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Housing and Health</h3>
<p>— Gu Buwen</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation. If "housing" is lacking, then there is no place to settle down. We toil all day long, running around, all for the sake of clothing and food; but if there is no stable residence, wouldn't that be terrible? In the current deformed prosperity, the so-called paradise of the isolated island, there is a great panic due to the housing problem. Although the second landlords enjoy unexpected benefits by taking advantage of the power of the god of war, it is not a small matter to exploit the fat of the third tenants, but it greatly affects human health and has a great relationship. A small house is occupied by six or seven families, and even the attic is full. As a result, the house is small and there are many people, and the air volume is not enough. There is even less talk of cleanliness, or ventilation is hindered, which affects breathing, or the lack of light causes bacteria to grow. Under these various conditions, it is difficult to have a healthy life, and it greatly harms the activities of the mind and body.</p>
<p>You need to know that the size of the house is very related to health. If the house is not suitable, it will hinder personal hygiene, easily make you feel bored and tired, weaken your body, and lack resistance, so infectious diseases are more likely to spread, and there is a possibility of developing tuberculosis and other diseases. At the same time, the mortality rate of residents will inevitably increase and life expectancy will be reduced, which are all the bad consequences of poor housing.</p>
<p>If we want to have a healthy body, we must pay attention to the hygiene of the house. At least, it should have the following standards:</p>
<p>Spacious Housing</p>
<p>The amount of fresh air we need for health is roughly as follows: Men - 3,600 cubic feet per person per hour. Women - 3,000 cubic feet per person per hour. Children - 2,000 cubic feet per person per hour.</p>
<p>Mixed Family - Average 2,000 cubic feet per person per hour.</p>
<p>From the above figures, we can know that in order to maintain normal breathing and fresh air, we must have a large space. Therefore, the houses where we usually settle down must also be quite spacious in order to maintain clean air and avoid breathing difficulties, resulting in diseases.</p>
<p>Open More Windows</p>
<p>As the Western proverb says: "Where the sun does not reach, the doctor often comes." It can be seen that light is very important for health. Houses with insufficient light are not only prone to nearsightedness, but also cause bacteria to grow, resulting in air pollution. The quality of light in a house depends entirely on the number and position of the windows. If you open more windows, you can not only circulate air, but also allow sunlight to enter, eliminating germs, so the number of windows can be used to judge the quality of the house.</p>
<p>Living Facilities</p>
<p>With spacious houses and more windows, if the living facilities do not meet hygiene standards, it is also difficult to meet the requirements of health. Living should meet hygiene standards, sleep should be on time, as for the facilities, do not pursue modernity, you should need simple applicable. It is common to see general families piling up miscellaneous things, which is most detrimental to hygiene. Allowing yourself to stay up late at night and not getting up until noon, keeping all the windows closed, and having no room that is not dirty, even if you live in a spacious house, it is still too far from the way to health.</p>
<p>Excellent Environment</p>
<p>Houses close to factories, or next to noisy roads, are troubled by soot, dust, and noisy noise all day long. This kind of soot contains harmful substances such as carbon dioxide and sulfurous acid, which is very harmful to the human body. In addition, the noise of the army and horses is unsettling all night, so the mind and body suffer great damage. If you encounter a fierce second landlord or an unruly neighbor, you will suffer great pain in your spirit. Therefore, the living environment should also be carefully selected and carefully considered.</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>North Faction Actively Trading, Cash Prices Greatly Decreasing then Slightly Recovering</p>
<p>Nearly Breaking Through the 2,100 Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>Yesterday's cash market for "boiled red" (gold bars) remained volatile, generally showing a sharp decline followed by a rebound, depending solely on the level of supply and demand. Initially, Erda Qian Dui Ye (representing the Tianjin Faction) and a certain silver firm (representing wealthy merchants) successively purchased, but because gold firms, silver firm factions, and Qian Dui Ye supplied heavily, resulting in supply exceeding demand, the market trended downward. At 10:00 AM, T-bonds and a certain Qian Dui Ye suddenly released holdings on behalf of the Tianjin Faction, which further unsettled the market, leading to a rush of sellers and a downward price spiral, nearly breaking through the 2,100 yuan barrier. Subsequently, a certain gold firm took advantage of low prices to purchase, and arbitrageurs in the foreign exchange market also became slightly active, coupled with a renewed aggressive advance by the securities faction, leading to a reverse rally. However, the final settlement resulted in a decrease of 11 yuan. There were many twists and turns along the way, but without excessive volatility. It was heard that after closing, the securities faction bid as high as 2,115 or 2,116 yuan to buy, but failed to find counterparties, resulting in no transactions. Overall trading was brisk at 950 taels. Silver jewelry declined by 2 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable.</p>
<p>"Boiled Red" Declines Another 11 Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, each bar (ten taels) opened weakly due to vigorous selling by gold firms and silver firm factions. At 9:40 AM, the first transaction saw a gold firm sell 50 taels to a silver firm faction at 2,115 yuan, an opening price 5 yuan lower than the previous close. After the opening, Qian Dui Ye's buying power remained strong, stabilizing the situation. Qian Dui Ye purchased 50 taels from a silver firm faction at 13 yuan, and another 50 taels from a peer at 12 yuan. Subsequently, it purchased another 50 taels from a silver firm faction at 14 yuan. Later, the silver firm faction purchased 50 taels from a gold firm at 15 yuan. After this, a certain Qian Dui Ye and gold firm began to release holdings, and the buying interest waned, leading to a renewed downward trend. A certain Qian Dui Ye sold 100 taels to a peer, pushing the price down by 4 yuan to 11 yuan, and then could not sustain it. A certain gold firm sold 50 taels to a silver firm faction at 09 yuan. At that time, the securities faction also followed suit by selling, further exacerbating the decline. A certain gold firm then purchased 50 taels from a securities faction at 01 yuan, followed by another 50 taels from a silver firm faction at 02 yuan. Qian Dui Ye purchased 50 taels from a silver firm faction at 01 yuan. A certain gold firm purchased another 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at 01 yuan, and the silver firm faction also purchased 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at the same price. Thereafter, a certain Qian Dui Ye suddenly absorbed holdings on behalf of arbitrageurs, and the price immediately rebounded. A certain Qian Dui Ye purchased 50 taels from a peer, and the price jumped 9 yuan to 10 yuan. Later, due to a larger number of suppliers, the price declined again. Qian Dui Ye traded 90 taels with each other at 06 yuan. The silver firm faction sold 50 taels to a Qian Dui Ye at 05 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, due to a sudden purchase by the securities faction, the underlying trend strengthened. Initially, the securities faction purchased 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at 07 yuan, and then purchased another 50 taels from a Qian Dui Ye at 08 yuan. Later, Qian Dui Ye traded 50 taels with each other at 09 yuan. After this, there was still an intention to purchase, but sellers were scarce, leading to an increase to 15 or 16 yuan, but no counterparties were found, so the evening closing price remained at 2,109 yuan, resulting in a net decline of 11 yuan compared to the previous close, with a difference of 14 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at gold firms was 2,120 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,105 yuan. The spot gold standard was priced 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with no transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Marked Down Twice</p>
<p>The price of jewelry gold at silver firms was initially unchanged. However, at 9:45 AM, due to the weak opening of "boiled red," it was marked down by 1 yuan. Later, at 10:20 AM, as "boiled red" fell near the 2,100 yuan barrier, it was marked down by another 1 yuan. After this, no changes were seen. Datong Hang changed to 214 yuan, and Xintong Hang to 212 yuan, with a purchase price of 206 yuan.</p>

Buying interest increased in the afternoon, resulting in a much greater decline than the previous evening. Foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, was in great demand. Domestic "boiled red" was weak, and the price of US and British pounds declined slightly. The demand for British and American gold bills was strong, and the market price declined slightly due to a slight easing of forward rates. Singapore bills and rupee bills were slightly oversupplied, and prices declined again. The supply and demand for Hong Kong bills remained stable. There were no transactions at the guild.

<p>The foreign exchange market was eager to be purchased by oil companies, Texaco, and other major foreign firms, while Chinese firms, Chinese merchants, speculators, and foreign banks were also competing to purchase. Although major British and American banks were still willing to supply spot goods at special prices, the intention to supply futures seemed somewhat weak. Although Hong Kong Telegraph and Sassoon, a Western merchant, once sold, they still felt that the supply was insufficient, so the process was once extremely tight. The British gold price for August once tightened to 7 pence and 9375, and the American exchange rate also softened to 15.4375 yuan. Later, because it aroused the interest of arbitrageurs, the price turned flat. According to the current swap, British gold requires 0.0625 per month, and the difference between spot and August narrowed to 25. The American dollar is tight by 125 per month, and the difference between spot and August reaches half a yuan. Calculated monthly interest, excluding commission, is about 7.5%. Spot trading was flat during the morning, and futures were more active. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, because the supply and demand of both parties were even, the result was also flat.</p>
<p>Early morning, because the recent rise in London large bars continued by 125, the quick rate rose by 0625, New York silver prices remained unchanged, London raw gold also remained unchanged, exchange rates British to US large 1%, to Shanghai still flat, to France long 3%. US to British expensive 0625, to Shanghai small 6%, to France no change, the Central Bank listed the exchange rates as before, the bank morning open spot selling price British exchange 8 pence 25, the US exchange 16 yuan 0625, are compared to the previous pastor average flat, after the opening Chinese firms and major foreign firms competed to buy British gold, but since British Bank HSBC was willing to supply, resulting in few changes. It is estimated that Chinese firms and foreign firms settled into HSBC spot British gold 8 pence 25, then foreign firms bought settled Chase Bank some of the spot US exchange 16 yuan 0625, the underlying trend also little change. HSBC listing released do not move, and the silver balance tax released to continue the big 7.5%, calculated to collect 6.75%. After this the spot trade turned silent, futures were quite lively, calculated foreign firms Hua Bi, Holland suddenly sucked up Hong Kong Telegraph this month's British gold 8 pence 1875, a foreign firms Hua Bi resold the transfer to Chinese firms June British gold 8 pence 125, (combined the monthly interest, excluding commission 7.5%) after the oil company Texaco also bought settled some bank this month's US exchange 15 yuan 9375, after the Eastern Huili Bank also bought settled Western merchants Sassoon July British gold 8 pence 0625, then foreign firms and Chinese merchants 相　settled into foreign banks August US exchange 15 yuan 5625, at that time the buyers still wanted to buy settled, but with the supply not prosperous, resulting in the underlying trend once brought tight, calculated British gold August once tight up to 7 pence 9375, US exchange also softened up to 15 yuan 4375, later because it aroused the interest of arbitrageurs, a small number of sales of futures British and American gold, so the situation back half, approaching noon, foreign firms Holland Anda frequently spit Hong Kong exchange, sold to Qian Dui Ye spot Hong Kong exchange 55 and a half yuan and 625, the situation is stable, until noon bank spot selling price British exchange 8 pence 25, US exchange 16 yuan 0625, Hong Kong exchange 55 yuan 625, results compared to the previous night close, British US Hong Kong 3 Exchange, no honor or disgrace, afternoon Wednesday no market</p>

<p>Black Iron Billets: Arrivals and Sales are Both Brisk</p>
<p>Previously, due to a shortage of black woven billets and strong demand from merchant gangs, the market was swept clean. Recently, new goods have started to arrive, but the Tianjin gang and the wood street thermos bottle factories are all rushing to process, and the market goods have a tendency to be sold as soon as they arrive. The market price is 30 yuan per box for 200-pound goods, and 32 yuan per box (calculated at 200 pounds) for 2,000-pound goods, which is 1 yuan better than the Weng market. More than 200 boxes were sold yesterday, but spot goods feel even thinner, and market sentiment is very good, and the asking price for the market is expected to continue to rise. It is found that new goods from overseas, such as 100-pound goods, are priced at 45 gold yuan per ton, and 2,000-pound goods are priced at 50 gold yuan per ton, and there are no recent spot goods.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Amidst Raging Winds and Torrential Rains</p>
<p>Actual sales remain stagnant: Relying solely on "passing the buck" trading among peers</p>
<p>Feeling of too much inventory: Selling prices drop by around 10 yuan</p>
<p>Japanese yarn speculators: Rumors of several stranded due to being squeezed</p>
<p>Recently, the cotton yarn market has seen surging waves, like being in the midst of a storm. In reality, after consecutive days of rising prices, customer sales have been scarce and stagnant. Therefore, buying and selling ensues, and when inventory feels slightly excessive, the market plunges. However, when prices are low, buyers return and prices quickly rebound. This kind of unstable situation is completely manipulated by speculators. High prices make people disoriented and unable to make decisions, creating a chaotic situation. In the afternoon, a sudden gust of speculative wind arose, causing those with a lot of speculative positions to sell, as actual sales did not come. It is found that yesterday's yarn price difference was more than 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, the market at the opening this morning was stable, and most were in a long position, so there was a consensus that the market would improve. Therefore, the opening price was often high, with the spot price for 20s Double Horse yarn still bid at 410 yuan, and the stack ticket price at 430 yuan, with little difference from the previous day. However, only 10 bales were traded among peers. Soon, the market gradually declined as the need for quality remained scarce and stagnant, with the price at 435 yuan, and the stack ticket price at 425 yuan, a drop of 5 yuan from the opening price. Subsequently, as the price loosened, multiple parties returned to action, and the purchase momentum reached its peak around 11 o'clock, with a slight rebound of two or three yuan. The spot price did 438-9 yuan, and the stack ticket price reached 428-9 yuan to 430 yuan. It is found that the market transactions were all "passing the buck" trading among peers. The market in the afternoon was dull, barely opening down by 1 yuan. Soon, sellers gathered, and the selling was strong, and the situation suddenly turned weak, with a sudden drop of 5 or 6 yuan. The spot price was 431 yuan, and the stack ticket price was 422 yuan. Tiannv stack tickets only dropped to 420 yuan. According to market rumors, certain parties were deliberately selling to push down the price, but it was only due to stagnant actual sales. As a result, various gangs bought a total of 1,363 bales. The market prices for 20s Double Horse and Tiannv brands fell by 7 or 8 yuan, Muyang fell by 12 yuan, Shuang Diqiu fell by 8.5 yuan, and other mid-range yarns fell by 4, 5, or 6 yuan. Yesterday, 30 pieces of yarn were shipped from Hong Kong. Today, 655 pieces of cotton yarn are being shipped to Tianjin, 565 pieces to Shantou, 22 pieces to Quanzhou, 11 pieces to Xiamen, and 545 pieces to Hong Kong. The quantities purchased by the various gangs are listed below:</p>
<p>Peers: 1,050 Inland: 125</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 78 Shantou: 10</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 15 Sichuan: 85</p>
<p>Total: 1,363</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market, which had been soaring for days, suddenly suffered a setback. According to market rumors, due to excessive recent rallies, those who sold short were squeezed and suffered heavy losses. Considering this environment, the trend could not be sustained, and several companies were stranded due to illiquidity. Therefore, blindly raising market prices resulted in the pain of not being able to collect the money even if they made a profit. Yesterday's price change was particularly shocking. The price rose by 5 yuan in the morning, fell by 10 yuan at noon, and suddenly collapsed in the afternoon. The high and low prices of the day differed by 20 yuan. It is found that many people only listen to the market price in the Qingdao Exchange and use it as a ratio and standard, resulting in huge waves. The highest price of 20s Yueqin in the morning was 400 yuan, and the closing price in the afternoon was only 380 yuan, a drop of 20 yuan. In this situation, some people made a fortune, and others lost everything, which is also to be expected.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Acreage Estimated to Increase; Over 10,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Continued to be Ordered</h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, New York cotton prices opened slightly higher by two or three pounds. Traders and spot merchants are selling recent contracts and rolling into deferred, as the spread between the nearby 70's and the new crop are large. The US government export subsidy issue is unresolved leaving many watchful. Senator Smith from the south indicates that these believe the export subsidy issue will fall by the wayside, and that he will gather southern senators to fight the opposition for export subsidies. The New York "Fa Te" (transliteration) published an estimate yesterday that the total cotton acreage in the United States is 27,197,000 acres, a 4% increase from the previous estimate. Nearby contracts in New York fell one to six points while deferred contracts rose five to seven points yesterday. Predictions are that Indian cotton will fall by one Rupee, Egyptian cotton is halted, cotton prices are flat and in legal tender values American, Brazilian and Indian cotton is down by a little over 40 cents per Dan (unit of weight).</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been quite lively in recent days, with a total of over 10,000 bales of Indian cotton ordered yesterday. Wah Fung (transliteration) took 4,000 bales while British and Japanese factories bought over 7,000. The existing stock at the Japanese factories is extremely low and close to being completely depleted. Those shipping from Japan have been actively searching for spot goods. We list below the prices yesterday for cotton to be sent to the factories:</p>
<p>Raw Materials / Category / To Factory with Taxes</p>

<p>32 count American Zhongte (transliteration) 81.75</p>
<p>32/42 count American Pengjiapu (transliteration) 89.25</p>
<p>The local cotton market has become dull with all the factories' "stomachs" closed; thus the market becomes despondent. There were two transactions for Indian cotton by peers, where the market prices rose slightly, the local prices for spot goods also rose with it, as prices for Indian corner pieces rose, 408 bales of Su Bei to Tongzhou cotton arrived, there are 3,000 pieces of cotton shipping from here to Shantou, we list the existing cotton market here:</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Raw White Soaring Even More Fiercely</p>
<p>Origin Reclaims Futures Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's Dutch crystal white price rose because the origin had reclaimed the July/August contracts again at 9.70 Dutch currency. The Tai Koo sugar mill in Hong Kong has also ceased selling, thus the market has become even more excited and has risen one yuan again. According to the guild's board, the outside storage price for No. 2 crystal white rose to 28 yuan and 7 jiao, and the local storage was 28 yuan and 8 jiao. It even called for prices as high as 29 yuan and 2 jiao. The initial marked price for re-exported goods was 20 yuan and 4 jiao, gradually rising to 0.8 jiao, with 1,300 bags transacted. Yi Chi also rose by half a yuan, with spot prices at 18 yuan and a half, and re-exported at 13 yuan. Local refined white followed suit, rising by one yuan, with Zhenji No. 1 at 28 yuan and a half, No. 2 at 28 yuan, No. 3 at 27 yuan and a half, and No. 4 at 27 yuan. The spot price for Tai Koo truck white B brand at the West Depot was 28 yuan and 4 jiao, OW brand at 28 yuan and 2 jiao, OX brand at 28 yuan, DY brand at 27 yuan and 8 jiao, and HX brand at 27 yuan and 7 jiao. H brand truck red was 18 yuan and a half. National sugar, with its source in Shantou, is expected to face obstacles and is also rising. Tizhuang Qing was 16 yuan and 2 jiao, but no transaction was made. Zhengmian Red was 16 yuan, with the corner price at 18 jiao, and 300-400 bags were opened. Chongti Qing was dozens of bags at 15 yuan and 7 jiao. The Guangdong gang opened 300 pieces of large basket flakes, rising one yuan to 11 yuan. The Jian gang opened 150 bags of Diao Qing at 14 yuan and 2 jiao. The Chao gang also opened 500 bags at 14 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>On the 3rd [date missing], 1,900 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong and 1,640 bags came from Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Flour Prices Look Promising</p>
<p>Factory Price Higher Than Foreign Wheat - Large Shipment of Australian Wheat to Arrive</p>
<p>Factory Flour: The factory flour market remains bullish. Since the No. 2 flour factory has raised prices to 4 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen in cash for several consecutive days, the factory still wants to raise prices and does not offer substantial supply. The reason for this is that the foreign production prices are rising frequently, and with the establishment of the "Hua Xing Bank" being voiced, prices are expected to rise, and market sentiment is consistently bullish. However, real sales by the northern gangs have also declined. At present, the exchange rate fluctuates too much, and they are not daring to take on significant risks. The goods purchased in the past two days were mostly speculative, so new transactions have decreased sharply. The southern gangs are also only making sporadic purchases. The total market transaction is around 30,000 bags. The market may have seen some support at one point.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Remains calm. According to inquiries, the goods arriving on the Tuoliti Bie Si (transliteration) ship are all Bat, Fox, and Shuang Ying brands. There is little supply on the market, and the supply should be limited. The current foreign production prices are rising frequently, and the costs of shipping insurance and other expenses are increasing, so the cost is higher, and the suppliers are unwilling to sell easily. Currently, the foreign flour market price is 4 yuan, 4 jiao to 3 jiao and a half in cash, but there are no large-scale transactions. Although the local factory flour is more expensive than foreign flour, the delivery deadline can be extended, so customers are paying attention to purchasing factory flour, causing the foreign flour market to be slightly suppressed.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat: Australian wheat is arriving in Shanghai again. The King Winian, managed by Jardine Matheson, has shipped 92,011 bags of wheat from Australia, totaling 7,713 tons. The wheat is managed by the Liji Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai today and is scheduled to berth at pontoons 11 and 12 to unload.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, there are 10,000 bags of flour being shipped to Tianjin, 14,200 bags to Xiamen, 22,900 bags to Quanzhou, 200 bags of bran to Quanzhou, and 500 bags of bran to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Claiming Source Obstruction</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Break Through the Limit</p>
<p>Guest Sen and Foreign Rice Do Well</p>
<p>National Rice: After the source was obstructed by various parties in the inland, fewer goods arrived in Shanghai. Fortunately, the warehouse goods gushed out, so the inventory felt thin. Stores and hoarders on the street massively collected the merchandise. Every day river trade under goods arrives at No. 1, train loads are only 14-1500 parcels, so the merchandise owners are thinking of snapping it up, the prices are breaking free of the 14 yuan limit as a result, and as a result thick and thin rice is priced at a high of 14 yuan, half, this is more than the earlier 3-5 jiao price increase, Du Yang tip tip is also doing better as a result, the market even called for 19 yuan because of shortages. In short, this market is affected by all sources and interior crude is at 12 yuan 5/6 jiao for the stout and 12 yuan or so for the thin.</p>
<p>Guest Sen: As big clients hoard, and the rumor is rife with "rice spikes", the sources are still coming in at 5-6000 bundles. Sources say that they're coming in daily at 5-6000 bundles, and merchants are charging higher because the costs have gone up, the prices of Jing Wu Sen is up to 13 yuan and the price has increased by 5-6 jiao per price, transactions were 7-8000 in huge transactions.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday, it was well received and local needs were unexpectedly strong, Saigon rice was at 14-1500 parcels for 17 yuan and 8 jiao, this is higher than the previous market by 2-3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Seafood</h3>
<p>Arrowroot Production Price Highly Increasing</p>
<p>Arrowroot has been highly increase, in price of production sources in Holland. To compare to the price in Shanghai, a increase of more than 2 yuan is calculated, i.e. yesterday 2-4 "biau" (transliteration) parcels (previous trade was 14 yuan) will trade to 16 yuan and 5 jiao. All the others are raising in price, like "ren cheung biao" (transliteration) is at 22 yuan, "fei kei kei" (transliteration) is at 19 yuan, 3x is at 18 yuan and 5 jiao, KG is at 17 yuan and 5 jiao, 3t is at 13 yuan and 5 jiao. The trend is very good.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials</h3>
<p>Xiamen Gardenia Sees New Stock</p>
<p>New stock of Xiamen gardenia has made its appearance, a number of vendor have transported a part to the recent markets, and will sell it immediately to distributors at a low price of 5-6 relative to the previous price.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Exports Greatly Boosted</p>
<p>New York Silk Market Experiences Squeeze Due to Stockpiling by Silk Mills</p>
<p>The foreign silk market is experiencing an intense bullish trend. New York spot silk is up two cents, nearby is up four cents, and deferred is up eight cents. Yokohama spot is opening at 1230 yen, a rise of 20 yen, and deferred is up 30 yen. It is reported that the squeeze in the New York silk market is not entirely due to speculation, but also due to a surge in purchasing by small silk mills. This factor is related to the current US policy, which emphasizes a Buy American campaign.</p>
<p>The local silk market saw a significant boost in exports yesterday. White factory silk, graded at 7-8, was sold from 1800 yuan to 1830 yuan. Jardine, Dachang, Lienat, and others purchased a total of 250 bales. Re-reeled silk, graded at six numbers, Qilin and Pao Ma grade were purchased by Renji, Dachang, and others for a total of 210 bales. The bargaining of manufacturers and silk merchants rose by around 50 yuan by the afternoon, so silk prices today are expected to continue to rise. On the 4th, there will be sixteen pieces of Xian silk shipped to Hong Kong. Also, on the 3rd, there were one thousand and twenty-six pieces of tea arriving from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Insiders and Outsiders Hoarding, Spot Soybean Oil</h3>
<p>Raw Oil Shipped from Hong Kong and Xiamen</p>
<p>The price of raw oil is secretly stable, mainly because although the source has been available recently, various commodity prices are increasing daily due to seasonal and environmental factors. Therefore, the raw oil market is quite active in secret. Yesterday, the market for Jiaozhou oil for delivery in one week opened at 38 yuan, with over 200 transactions.</p>
<p>Three days ago, 400 pieces of raw oil arrived from Hong Kong and 500 pieces from Xiamen.</p>
<p>The potential for soybean oil to rise is even greater because futures trading has ended. Subsequent supplies will inevitably be monopolized, leading speculators both inside and outside the industry with capital to purchase spot goods. As a result, market prices are rising. Yesterday, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 33.5 yuan, and 150 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil at 34.2 yuan and 34 yuan. Fifty large baskets of Lianqi soybean oil traded at 44.5 yuan. Over 300 barrels of Da Yun spot oil increased from 46.35 yuan to 46.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>No Significant Changes in Pressed Cakes, Mostly Futures Trading</h3>
<p>As for bean cake trading, only Da Yun cakes were traded yesterday. The market situation has not changed significantly recently, mainly because the inland market has been seized by fertilizer powder, resulting in sluggish sales of spot cakes. The market mainly focuses on futures trading, with prices fluctuating between one and two cents. Yesterday, 2,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand spot cakes were traded at 2.92 yuan, up one cent from the previous day. Miscellaneous brand futures for May opened at 2.945 yuan, and Yuanji opened at 2.95 yuan, with a total of 2,000 pieces traded. Miscellaneous brand futures for June opened at 3.045 yuan, and Yuanji from 3.08 yuan to 3.07 yuan, with a total of 5,000 pieces traded.</p>
<p>Regarding soybean imports, 984 bags arrived from Tianjin three days ago. Furthermore, on the fourth, 280 bags were exported to Quanzhou, 300 bags to Hong Kong, and 50 bags to Hong Kong. Moreover, three days ago, 5,000 pieces of cottonseed oil arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Profitable Resales of Second-Hand Goods, Slight Dip in the Cloth Market</h3>
<p>Increased Warehouse Construction in Haiphong, Strong Sales Expected</p>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>The market slightly softened due to profitable resales of second-hand goods by peers. For white cloth, Jardine Matheson's weaving factory quoted the highest price for 1,000 pieces each of light and heavy grades for this month, with second-hand goods priced down by 5 to 20 cents per bolt. Fine cloth and fine twill also decreased by about 10 cents per bolt. Wholesale shops in this street purchased over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Stockpilers absorbed 200 pieces of coarse cloth. Banks handled 100 pieces of Fugui Earth, Dapeng fine cloth, and fine twill for transport to Kunming. Dyeing and printing factories are reluctant to buy, while scattered second-hand goods are sold at low prices. Wholesale shops on Wood Street are selectively gathering cheap goods, with 300 to 400 boxes of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and serge being traded. Autumn and winter goods are receiving the most attention. Customers from Sichuan and Guizhou are rushing to ship goods. It is heard that banks and transportation companies are actively constructing more warehouses for the goods accumulated in Haiphong awaiting shipment. In the future, difficulties in storing goods will be avoided, and sales are expected to be even stronger.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The price of fine cloth and fine twill fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, and the market atmosphere turned calm. Twelve-pound Longtou, Yanghe, and other brands of fine cloth opened at around 14.6 yuan in the morning and rose to 14.8 or 14.9 yuan in the afternoon, with futures at 15.15 yuan, a decrease of 10 cents from the previous day's price. Fine twill also continued to decline slightly. Spot Yanghe was 13.9 yuan per bolt. Because outside stockpilers did not come to buy, and sales among peers and customer groups were limited, only about 1,000 pieces were traded throughout the day. Trading firms did not quote prices, and shops in this street purchased 700 to 800 pieces, while northern merchants purchased over 300 pieces.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the fourth, 165 pieces of textiles were exported, with 16 pieces transported to You Tou, 150 pieces to Quanzhou, and 150 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>The Achievements of the April Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>A few days ago, military observers in London said that it was doubtful whether it was a smart move for the Chinese army to counterattack Guangzhou and Nanchang at this time and recapture them. Their meaning is easy to understand: the Chinese army at this time does not need to launch a counterattack, let alone a general counterattack, to recapture a city or town at a great cost. Such recapture is not worth the loss.</p>
<p>Now, our first large-scale counteroffensive has come to a temporary end with the passing of April. Reviewing the opinions of the London military observers, we feel that they do have considerable reason, which is also similar to the opinions of most of us: counterattacks are necessary when the opportunity arises, but it is not necessary to occupy any city. Therefore, although the April counteroffensive did not permanently recapture Guangzhou or Nanchang, the role of the counteroffensive was fully realized.</p>
<p>Our army's counterattack on Guangzhou foiled the enemy's attempt to attack Xijiang and take Guangxi; the counterattack on Nanchang shattered their dream of capturing Changsha; and the counterattack on the east bank of the Han River made them give up their delusion of crossing the Han River to spy on Shashi and Yichang. These are all obvious facts that do not require any embellishment. If there had been no such counterattacks, the enemy would have exclusively occupied the initiative, moving at will, and we would have been unable to prevent it. I am afraid that the front lines of both sides would have moved westward by some distance.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that our army's counterattack is necessary, but it is not necessary to rigidly adhere to one place and disrupt the overall war plan. From this, it can also be seen that our army does have the strength to counterattack, and once the time is ripe, it can sweep down with the force of a broken bamboo and recover all the lost land. From this, it can be further seen that the enemy's strength is indeed limited, and we will eventually have a day when we can take whatever we want from them.</p>
<p>Before our army's counterattack, many people were eagerly expecting the counterattack: they were somewhat disappointed when the counterattack did not start. During the course of the counterattack, many people were eagerly awaiting victory; they were somewhat disappointed when victory did not come continuously. Now, after the counteroffensive has come to an end, I believe there must still be many people waiting incessantly for another counteroffensive; they will inevitably be disappointed or even frustrated when the counteroffensive is delayed again. I want to say to them: their enthusiasm is commendable; their disappointment or discouragement is unnecessary! We have a clear plan; we have inevitable victory!</p>
<p>The April counteroffensive can be used as a transitional stage from defense to complete counteroffensive. It is an important link in the entire war process, and its value is self-evident. In order to achieve future victories, we must cherish this April counteroffensive and regard it as our initial success!</p>
<h3>Soviet Female Aviator (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By Polina Osipenko, Translated from Moscow News by He Yan</p>
<p>I deeply begged the principal, I decided I want to be an aviator! I want to defend the country and never lose to other men! The principal smiled, he suggested I could take a physical exam, and the doctors all said I qualified.</p>
<p>After that, I was a student at the aviation school, I had a uniform and a room in the dormitory.</p>
<p>I don't want to tell you about the difficulties at the beginning now, I read books from morning till noon till night, the desire was so great, I wanted to be a knowledgeable aviator, I was stingy with every minute other than reading.</p>
<p>At the same time, I saw many aviators, and things that I could not have imagined before. I saw a destroyer flying like a rocket in the air, turning right and then left, rotating its body, flipping somersaults, flying out of ring patterns. This machine like a beetle was wonderfully obedient in the air, performing strange performances under precise calculations. It was as silent as a wren, as elusive as a swallow, soaring over Ukraine.</p>
<p>Airplanes landed one after another, I watched the faces of the aviators coming out of the cockpits, they were superhuman, with incredible and brimming skills.</p>
<p>He, who drove that destroyer, among many people, his face, his pace, his smile, what was different from ordinary people? I thought, his story was no different from going from a factory or a collective farm, a young Communist Youth League member, to an aviation school.</p>
<p>He started flying alone, not long before me. The students did not talk much about their first flight, soon it was my turn.</p>
<p>One day, I came back from practicing with the teacher, and I made a very bad landing. At that time, I really didn't dream that I would be flying alone. My teacher didn't say a word about my bad landing, but turned around and asked me if I was tired.</p>
<p>"No," I said.</p>
<p>"Good, you can do a solo flight."</p>
<p>Happiness and suddenness made me almost afraid to breathe, but I did not abandon my consciousness.</p>
<p>"Very good, teacher," I calmly replied.</p>
<p>I went up, I will not forget this moment, I was alone in the air, the teacher was on the ground, I was flying alone. I made a satisfactory landing, I took off again for the second time, everything was going well, and that's how my solo flying began.</p>
<p>But, I still have a long way to go, I decided I wanted to become a successful aviator.</p>
<p>At the end of 1932, I graduated from aviation school, I was sent to learn to be a military aviator.</p>
<p>Soon I was appointed as a squad leader, my work achievements obviously made great progress. In addition to my main work, I also did many social things, helping my husband study and work. I continued to work hard, I learned to drive, and at the same time I paid attention to my education. I graduated from a labor school, and I was preparing to enter a military aviation school again. I flew for six years, and nothing happened, not even a forced landing. . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>When I had enough confidence, I asked my commander to allow me to make a long-distance flight, he thought for a while and said:</p>
<p>"I advise you to make a flight to the highest altitude beforehand, do you agree?"</p>
<p>I agreed.</p>
<p>In September 1936, the commander called me and told me that I could make a flight to the highest altitude to test the maximum altitude of the aircraft.</p>
<p>I drove the "Vonda" seaplane, and I stayed at an altitude of 30,000 feet for 19 minutes. The plane could still rise higher, but I didn't dare to go to its limit. When I landed, Commander Jia Gen congratulated me.</p>
<p>"You have flown higher than any woman in the world," he said.</p>
<p>My husband, also a squad leader, also flew to a great altitude, but I surpassed him, surpassing everyone in our group. In this exercise, I reached 23,000 feet without using oxygen equipment.</p>
<p>In May 1938, I and my teammates Fran Romalina and Lanskova made a non-stop long-distance flight, establishing an international women's long-distance flight record, flying around with our seaplane, we flew one thousand and ninety-three miles.</p>
<p>On July 2, 1938, we came again for a non-stop flight, from Sebastopol to Arkhangelsk, passing one thousand seven hundred and seven miles in ten hours and thirty-three minutes.</p>
<p>These are recorded in the Aviation Games Committee, creating two all-Soviet women's flight records, straight-line flight and curved-line flight.</p>
<p>Having received the Order of Lenin and government rewards, Lomako and I both received the rank of captain, and Lansko Fa was also promoted to deputy captain.</p>
<p>I will never rest for the sake of honor, I will continue to work hard, flying to higher altitudes and longer distances! (The End)</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Because the "power" radical is unnecessary for the character "move" in "labor," it is also thought that generally the various characters that are unnecessarily and excessively given radicals can indeed save a few things. For example: "read," "taste," "where" (when used for "there"), "vortex," etc., the mouth radical and the three-dot water radical are not necessary, and the meaning is naturally clear.</p>

<h3>The May Fourth Movement Today</h3>
<p>— Ren Yi</p>
<p>Twenty years ago today, the young students of Beiping wrote a particularly glorious page in history with their bloodstains. The significance and value of the May Fourth Movement can be said to be the opportunity for a "Renaissance in the Orient of the 21st century."</p>
<p>Today, it is worth re-evaluating it. In terms of the law of historical development, commemorating the May Fourth Movement does not mean hoping to have a repeated writing; on the contrary, it means abandoning all that was old in the past and evolving new things. The May Fourth Movement of the past was: 1. Overthrowing the humiliating treaties and traitors. 2. Establishing the foundation for a new anti-feudal culture. Now, to meet the needs of the times, it is necessary to more powerfully complete the new mission:</p>
<p>1. Chairman Chiang said: "Compromise halfway is destruction." For the survival, independence, and freedom of the nation, this sacred duty of resistance; we must absolutely and resolutely abide by the three major principles of "nation above all, nation above all; military first, victory first; concentration of will, concentration of strength," and have the belief that "resistance will be victorious, and nation-building will be successful." 2. For any traitorous distorted theories, we must be vigilant at all times, constantly guard against them, and even more ruthlessly expose, attack, and eliminate them, because tolerance is equivalent to surrendering to the aggressors. Here, it is especially necessary to rectify our ranks of young students to shoulder the important task of the nation's vanguard.</p>
<p>3. In addition, "We must not only resist, but we must also build the country." Under the goal of striving for final victory, we should enrich our lives, strengthen our bodies, correct our thoughts, not be passive, not fall behind, and not be reactionary: contribute everything to the country, muster the spirit of great fearlessness, and work hard for the great cause of national liberation.</p>
<p>Friends! Do not fail our present, and write a more glorious page in history! (Proceeds from charity performance)</p>
<h3>Today's Commemoration</h3>
<p>— Dian Zhang</p>
<p>Today, May Fourth, is "Youth Day." It was a great new movement of the Chinese nation against aggression and feudalism: as the vanguard of promoting the new cultural movement, it laid the cornerstone of the new culture. Here, Chinese youth first appeared with a new and sharp fighting posture.</p>
<p>It was precisely because the European war had just ended that the international situation was in a state of confusion, and semi-colonial China had a rare opportunity; but because it failed to clearly recognize the contradictions between the great powers and seize the opportunity well, it ended up failing at the Paris conference, while the distant imperialists took advantage of their superior position to aggressively press forward, giving the Chinese ruling class a very strong stimulus; they felt the weakness of the feudal government, and under the slogan of "fighting for national rights abroad and punishing traitors at home," they bravely struggled, and the Northern Warlords were finally forced to punish the traitors who humiliated the country. However, at the Washington Conference, "national rights" were still not obtained, which was the most painful page in the history of diplomacy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it also showed that China's new social strata had not grown sufficiently and failed to deeply penetrate the broad lower classes to form a strong battle line against the outside world; and the feudal forces' stubborn rebellious role precisely reflected the fact that the new moderate movement was not promoted enough--its "enlightenment" only reached a few, and the masses were not organically linked, and the will and strength were not concentrated as a whole, which was such a pity.</p>
<p>Mr. Democracy, clad in a false disguise, was unable to exert a positive effect; and the task of enabling the social means of production to be automated, which Science contemplated, was not completed, which was the misfortune of the semi-colonial country at that time.</p>
<p>The new culture of the May Fourth Movement in the East was a continuation of the Xinhai Revolution, seeking a thorough transformation in the ideological realm to adapt to the weak economic foundation of the new social strata. It certainly had a flourishing and vigorous atmosphere for a time, but the subsequent difficulty was precisely due to its objective conditions. Here, we must criticize it rigorously and historically.</p>
<p>Today is the twentieth anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, and the great and unprecedented national resistance has lasted for more than twenty months, and the day of final victory is not far away. When we look back on the past and seize the present, we feel both infinite sorrow and joy: the historical mission left by the May Fourth Movement must be quickly completed at this time.</p>
<p>Naturally, history is dialectically progressing: the international situation is already different from what it used to be, and who is clothing us and who is attacking us must be clearly recognized; China has stood firm on its own and is actively striving for international friendship, which is the most urgent task in diplomacy: genuine allies should come here (and there is one that has never existed in previous history, which should be paid more attention to). Those who have bad intentions should not come, and the accomplices should get out of here! We must more thoroughly "punish traitors at home," and in the crisis of the war of resistance, we must avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, and we can no longer lightly forgive the microbes of history; we must inherit and expand the anti-traitor and anti-feudal movement.</p>
<p>Here, it should be mentioned that the new enlightenment movement, which was pointed out before "August 13," is now being put into practice with greater development in the process of the war of resistance, and it cannot be separated from the war of resistance and nation-building, and has long been linked together. Different from the enlightenment movement of the May Fourth Movement, it gave the masses a kind of spiritual liberation: clearing away ignorant traditional concepts; strengthening a strong national consciousness; popularizing new scientific ideas; and supporting genuine democratic politics. Only it can consolidate the great national united front and ensure the final victory of the war of resistance; and it can further serve as the spiritual foundation for building an independent, free, and equal new China.</p>
<p>At present, the general mobilization program of the national spirit proposed by Chairman Chiang is a more concrete way to arm the people's thinking and make it match the war of resistance; in order to achieve this unified goal, further expanding the new enlightenment movement is one of the greatest tasks at present.</p>
<p>Let us repeat a sentence: The historical mission left by the May Fourth Movement must be quickly completed at this stage. (Charity Donation)</p>

<h3>Record of Wang Youchen's Spirit Manifestation After Death (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>I happened to hear Wang Youchen's "Crashing the Stele" record on the radio. This reminded me of the manifestation of Youchen's spirit to me last year after his death. I have long wanted to write it out to tell my fellow opera fans, but I have been too busy. However, this matter often lingers in my mind. As the saying goes, "A true friendship is seen in life and death." I have known Youchen the longest. Whether his entry into my dream was a return of his soul or just an accidental dream of mine, I cannot know. However, we have known each other for more than twenty years and he never sought to enter my dream. Only half a month after his death, I dreamed of him and conversed with him. There must be a reason, and it is necessary to record the whole story, as well as the process of our acquaintance. It can be regarded as mourning him and crying for him.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, Youchen, as an amateur opera performer, soon entered the profession and performed at a certain stage in Shanghai (it seems to be the first stage of Dangui), which was quite well-received. My fellow villager Mr. Chen Ziliang (also an opera enthusiast, who died early) listened to Youchen's opera together and invited him to visit. During the conversation, Youchen said: "We are fellow villagers, and our ancestral home is Xuzhou. Our ancestral graves are in Pu County, with Wanping as our second generation. Our original surname is Liu, and we adopted the surname Wang after inheriting from our maternal uncle." (Later, I met Mr. Liu Tiefu in Beiping, who was his brother. They had a discordant relationship.) This was the beginning of our friendship. In the following years, we often saw each other in Shanghai, but our friendship was not deep. Around the tenth year of the Republic, Youchen performed at the Yi Stage, singing "Catching and Releasing Cao" and "Inn," with many mistakes in the lyrics, which were reversed and almost made it impossible to finish the performance (the zither player was Xu Lanyuan). Seeing me watching the opera in the audience, he ordered his follower to invite me to his residence in Yingchunfang and asked me to smooth things over with the press and the amateur opera circles. Our friendship gradually deepened, and we often studied the tunes and words together. His second wife was the daughter of Tan Xinpei, commonly known as "Old Girl," who was not tall, spoke well, and suggested that Youchen and I become sworn brothers. So, we addressed each other as brothers, but there was no formal oath.</p>
<p>When Youchen sang "Fishing and Killing Family" at the Yi Stage, his spine dislocated by more than an inch. He was in so much pain that he could not go on stage. He consulted me for a doctor, and I asked Mr. Mi Jianhua, a specialist in northern-style massage and a martial artist, to massage him. He was able to go on stage in a few days and recovered completely in more than ten days. Youchen was proud in his prime. In the second and third years of the Republic, he greedily organized the Republican Central Stage and became its owner (later renamed Yi Stage, which is now the site of the new Huizhong). During the ten years from the age of thirty to forty, he was extremely successful. At that time, after the death of Lao Tan, Youchen, as his son-in-law, wanted to directly inherit the orthodox Tan style, using all the martial and civil music and stage personnel that Lao Tan used (the drummer was Liu Shunla, and the zither player was Xu Lanyuan; I don't remember the others). In the winter of the seventh year, Youchen returned to Beiping. I saw him singing "Empty City Stratagem" at Qingleyuan on the first day (singing to the point where the Nanyang rhythm was unstable, which I will not elaborate on as it is not the main point of this article). At that time, Yan Jupeng had not yet entered the profession, Ma Lianliang was working in Fuliangcheng, Yu Shuyan's voice had not recovered, and he was performing amateur opera at the Zhejiang-Cihui Hall. Gao Qingkui was still performing hard roles, and Tan Fuying had not yet finished his training. Therefore, Youchen was able to be very popular for a while. He performed at the Yi Stage in Shanghai for the longest time. "Zhuge Liang Marrying a Bride" was produced at this time. Youchen played Zhuge Liang as a young man without sideburns, and also dressed as a female role to perform "Spinning Cotton," singing various folk tunes, starting the trend of Beijing opera senior actors creating new plays and cross-dressing as female roles, which also started with Youchen.</p>
<h3>Abandoned Child · Mother Returns · Ward No. 5: Three Plays for Charity</h3>
<p>— Du Shui</p>
<p>Raising Funds for Refugee Education, "Patriotic" Daughters Rise Up</p>
<p>The early summer breeze brushed the sweat from the girls' foreheads. At 2 o'clock on Saturday afternoon, the hall of the Ningbo Fellow Association was draped in a simple garment. The amateur performance of the Patriotic Girls' High School opened.</p>
<p>Accordion performances and tap dancing were interludes between the three short plays.</p>
<p>"Abandoned Child" was performed first. This is a realistic scene, depicting several women in a shelter who have been subjected to harsh weather. One of them, unable to afford to raise her child, tearfully separates from her flesh and blood. "Mother Returns" is a one-act play that seems to oppose feudalism. It presents two absolute extremes of women's widowhood and remarriage to the audience. A son, because of his mother's elopement and abandonment, ten years later resolutely refuses the return of his fallen and remorseful mother, and even refuses to call her "Mama" when she asks him to. "Ward No. 5" is a three-act play. It is more than just a tragic love story that exposes ugly aspects of society. These three plays were directed by Mr. Xu Lili and Mr. Fang Hudao, and the latter two plays were rehearsed by the newly established "Patriotic Drama Club."</p>
<p>In terms of script, "Mother Returns" is written more successfully. Apart from a slightly slack passage at the beginning, from the mother's appearance until the end of the play, almost every dialogue can tightly grasp the characters' emotional atmosphere. "Ward No. 5" incorporates many humorous elements. "Abandoned Child" seems a bit weak in its description. The consciousness is not vague, but the technique is not sufficient.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it is worth mentioning the role of the mother in "Mother Returns." Her performance is very realistic. The younger sister in "Ward No. 5" is also very kind. The rest are generally not bad, especially the makeup is even better.</p>
<p>Amateur actors certainly won't achieve perfect results. The diamond ring on the refugee's finger and the origin of the sedative in the ward are all things that should be noted. In terms of effects, the car horn outside the door and the moans of patients in the neighboring room should also be improved. The director's handling in "Abandoned Child" is not very good. It loses the power to control the climax. When the child enters the door, she neither cries "Mama" nor rushes forward, and she remains silent when she leaves, which makes the play much weaker.</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that a consumer cooperative held a charity sale in the theater, and the results were very good. When we came out, the sky was covered by night.</p>
<h3>Three Flowers</h3>
<p>Diana Bow Bing, Helen Pilishi, and Nang Lai are gradually growing up. Helen loves to read French, and Diana, in addition to reading French, is also studying English and has singing lessons every day. The three of them are good friends outside of work hours.</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of Watching "Before Yanmen Pass" at the Golden Theater</h3>
<p>— Wu Wozun</p>
<p>Mr. Wozun, whose name is Boqiao, is from Wujin. He is over sixty years old and has published a collection of poems and essays by Boqiao, which was greatly admired by the late Zhang Qian'an of Nantong. He started playing opera very early. The talent of the former Nantong Opera School was due to Segin's invitation to Ouyang Yuqian and Wu Wozun as teachers (Yuqian's plays were also mostly taught by Wu). He has been a long-time resident of Shanghai and has never set foot in the opera world. This article can be said to be rare. With the introduction of Brother Zhang Xiaocang, it is specially published to show respect and for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts. (Ping's note)</p>
<p>In the past decade, the pen has been at my disposal. Day and night, I have been constantly occupied. Apart from being invited by Wan Hua to watch her perform "Assassinating the Tiger" and watching Xiao Yun's "Sacrificing the Pagoda" at the Huang Yu Theater, and watching Chunhang's "Flower Field Wrong" and Feng Xiaoqing's several plays, I have rarely frequented opera houses. Recently, Guo Mingsue invited me to watch "Before Yanmen Pass" at the Golden Theater, which I was extremely satisfied with. I recall that in the past, in Peking, I watched the collaboration of De Lin, Yun Fu, Yao Qing, Wan Hua, Feng Qing, and Suo Yun, which was mature and flawless. Finally, in Shanghai, at the Gongwu Stage, I watched Yao Qing's Empress Xiao, You Qing's Qing Lian, and Ju Peng and Zhong Ren playing the fourth and eighth princes, which was not inferior to the well-matched cast in Peking. However, Yao Qing's performance was experienced and her lines were crisp. Compared to De Lin, they achieved the same effect through different means. This time, E Yun, under the guidance of Yao Qing, rehearsed and performed the play, earning great acclaim and attracting large audiences. E Lou's demeanor was elegant, and her singing and recitation were solid. Among female performers, she is a top talent. Sheng Lansheng is fresh and handsome, and her future is limitless. Shi Sen's fourth prince, although he did not fully display his talents, was still natural and graceful, truly showing the style of a master. Among them, Tong Shan (Jiarong Cao)'s Empress Xiao was the most well-suited. Tong Shan was famous along with Xiao Yun at a young age in Zhengle. After she came of age, she devoted herself to research. After returning north from Tianchan, she received the true teachings of Yao Qing. She was particularly detailed and meticulous in her portrayal of Qing costume plays. She also humbly sought advice from De Lin and Gui, so she was able to draw on the strengths of others and form her own style. Her voice gradually became clear and mellow after the Republic of China, and her tone was able to maintain elegance and correctness. She can be said to be someone who can establish herself. In this play, her singing, recitation, expression, and steps were all a collection of the essence of De Lin and Yao Qing. Together, they heard the eight sounds of the fraudulent pass. Angered, Qing Lian wanted to uphold the law, but in the end, she was moved by the cries of her two grandchildren and reluctantly forgave her beloved daughter. It was not easy to resolve the conflict between public duty and personal feelings, between law and emotion. Sometimes her voice and expression were powerful, and sometimes she shed tears of old age. Her portrayal was subtle and vivid, capturing the essence of the character. Tong Shan is still in her prime, and her skills have already reached a state of perfection, which is not easy to achieve. I recently met with my old friend Mr. Yang, who also praised Cheng Tong Shan's performance in this play as a successful masterpiece. Furthermore, Tong Shan secluded herself to refine her skills, not seeking fame or vanity. She never cared about the ranking of plays or the order of names on the poster. Her magnanimity is especially beyond the reach of ordinary people. In addition, Yan Shishan's fourth wife, her appearance and expression, is not only unique among martial actors, but also ranks among the top choices among female actors. Others, such as Yu Sulian's Bi Lian, Liu Lianrong's Meng Liang, and Guan Shengxi's Sixth Prince, were all competent. Ma Fulu's cross-dressing as She Taijun had an extremely loud voice, but unfortunately, his demeanor was close to that of an old man, which only won the audience's laughter, which is the means of a famous clown and should not be criticized.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Dumei Theater</h3>
<p>The Dumei Theater at the intersection of Dumei Road was founded by a group of well-known foreign expatriates in Shanghai. It has strong capital and a grand scale. The site has already started construction, and the project is huge. It is expected to open in the latter half of this month. It is said that the company pays great attention to film selection and will choose first-class films to screen. At that time, it will add a special touch to the Shanghai film industry.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Opera World</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Reasons for the Rise in the Status of Actors After the Republic of China</p>
<p>The plays were taught for three days. Here is a list of the most well-matched plays for your reference. I believe opera fans will be able to imagine the grand occasion at that time. If we were to calculate the ticket prices for Sun, Yang, Yu, Mei, Liu, and others performing solo, even if we calculated each person's ticket price at two or three yuan, then the ticket price for these famous actors performing together would have to be more than ten yuan. For three days, it would cost thirty or forty yuan. At that time, I only spent the round-trip fare from Shanghai to Bengbu and was able to hear these rare plays. Therefore, I often consider this to be a great fortune in my life.</p>

<p>(II) Zhang Xun, the Pigtail General, also held a grand performance in Xuzhou</p>
<p>In the fifth year of the Republic of China, Zhang Dingwu was stationed in Xuzhou as the Yangtze River Patrol Envoy. He repeatedly sent people to Beijing to invite famous male and female actors such as Hou Junshan, Wang Youchen, Guan Dayuan, Meng Xiaoru, and Wang Keqin to Xuzhou to participate in the performance to celebrate his birthday and the completion of his ancestral hall. As mentioned in "Secret History of the Pear Garden in the Former Capital," Zhang Xun and Hou Junshan had a close relationship. Zhang Xun had been Hou Junshan's servant in his early years, so when Hou arrived in Xuzhou, he stayed at the Patrol Envoy's residence and dined with Zhang, receiving his utmost hospitality. It was not only because Hou and Zhang had a special personal friendship, but also because Hou was deeply favored by Zhang. It was a case of "love me, love my dog." The status of the actors was raised considerably without intention. - (II)</p>

<h3>Grand Water Dragon Festival</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper from May of the eleventh year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Last night, the Shanghai Water Dragon Festival was held, and the viewers packed the streets. Starting from nine o'clock, the public water dragons were all arranged at the Gongzheng Wharf on the Bund. There were seven in total, and their styles were exquisite and varied. They were arranged in rows, neat and orderly. Torches and fireballs, along with white letters, and two bands played drums and flutes. The Western patrolmen held whips and sticks, and the procession started leisurely from the Bund in the French Concession. All the uniforms followed their respective colors, red ones in red, and black ones in black. Behind the water dragons were the Chinese who had joined the association, mostly from the tea, silk, and other industries. Each industry donated funds to help, so they also had a certain uniform and a certain style of lantern. The lanterns were all tall-handled. The crowd was dense and crowded, with no less than one or two thousand people forming a team. Those who pulled the water dragons were either Westerners or Chinese, and their uniforms were also of various colors. From the British Concession, the lights stretched far to the Huangpu Bund, like stars in the sky, the fire like bright cinnabar, and the light like flowing electricity, extending for half a mile. And occasionally, a blue fireball appeared, and then a yellow fireball, and then a green fireball, and then a white fireball. It was truly a spectacle to behold! After walking around for a week, to the Municipal Council, the fire festival building was covered with five-colored glass lamps, and fire signs were launched from the building from time to time. The fire signs were as high as the clouds, beyond the reach of Chinese meteors. When they flew up, they shot straight into the constellations, and halfway up, a full moon shape appeared, bright and radiant, like the Guanghan Palace. Suddenly, it burst open, and countless sparks scattered and fell, like stars falling like rain. As soon as one sign fell, another sign rose, and the viewers were dazzled and swayed, looking up in surprise! Then they turned west on the main road, then south again, passed the Sanmaoge Bridge, and then turned back to the Bund, before dispersing.</p>
<p>The next day, we will publish excerpts of important diplomatic news.</p>
