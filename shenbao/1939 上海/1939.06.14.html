<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國外交之明朗</h3>
<p>英國外相哈里法克斯氏隔昨在彼國會作重耍演說，闡明英國當前之外交政策，紀如今日報端；所指皆現實，所論甚詳明，所涉至廣而所關至大；對於每一事所表示之每一態度，均極露骨而使人不復能「誤會」，且極堅決而示人以不復能動搖。原外交演說之功能，必有其最高限度；而哈里法克斯氏隔昨演說，宜獲最高效騐；謂竟未能使混沌者淸澄，謂竟無所裨補於時艱，則必外交之外別有因素焉，使應有之功能爲所削弱。</p>
<p>英國之外交，在歷史上夙負盛譽，雖揆之以人類文明，或衡之以羣居正義，將因時因事而得逈不相侔之評騭，尤以輙有蒭狗萬物之嫌，每爲論者所不直，然彼自爲計者，洵高人一等；此史家所共許，非一家之私言也。最近二年餘，張伯倫氏當政；前距歐洲大戰雖將廿載，然創痕如新，餘悸未消，而頻年經濟恐慌，尤使負有邦國重任者有臨深履薄之感；會逢暴戾之氣充溢歐亞，國際秩序與道德原則，旣千瘡百孔，而破壞秩序與道德者所陰蓄之破壞力量，復駸駸乎駕英國與其友邦之力量而上之。於是張伯倫氏主宰下之英國外交，幾乎盡隳其歷史盛譽。蓋彼傳統之外交作風，夙能游刃有餘者至是而動輒得咎。一以兢兢於獨善其身，雖於友邦，亦未能推心置腹，見義勇爲；遂致友邦之問，不免於隔閡。二以結歡强暴，爲强暴所視爲易與，從而紿之侮之。三以漠視弱小，或偶予同情，而爲德不卒；或虛相委蛇，乃爲弱小所不敢信任；或且犧牲弱小。總之，數月前之英國外交，首鼠兩端，弄巧成拙，進退失據，衆叛親離，忍氣吞聲而委屈至於難以自全。事實歷歷，盡在目前，無待我人贅述，迄於捷克之亡，始轉變而入新階段。</p>
<p>新階段不自今始，抑何爲而盛稱外相哈里法克斯氏隔昨之演說？哈里法克斯氏隔昨洋洋灑灑以言者，有新意義乎？有新提示乎？無有也。如謂（一）遠東各種現行條約，不容片面更張；（二）英國在華權利與商務，必以全力保衛；（三）上海駐軍，決不撤退；（四）日本詭辯，決不接受；此其要點，皆英國所屢屢聲明者也。雖然，有應分別觀者。英法蘇聯三國締結互助協定之談判，英國宣傳，輒稱不涉遠東，此而謂非示惠於日本，不可得也；如此秋波，姑不問受者如何，而旁觀者則側目；英外相隔昨之演說，可以糾正示惠所引起之誤會。三國談判，就內情言，則英國曲盡妥協之姿，蘇聯抝執吹求之甚；就環境言，侵略國家離間播弄於外，綏靖餘毒伺機蠢動於內；如此縱橫稗闔，何難覆雨翻雲；而英外相隔昨之演說，顯示蘇聯態度不足以影響英國在遠東之態度。日本方面對英國。無論宣傳之攻訐，事實之威脅，日益加甚；衡之數年來英國之畏縮卑怯，或鑒於日本攻訐威脅之烈，行將以苟且瓦全爲得計；而英外相隔昨之演說，對日本意態行動之鮮明答復也。蓋英國在國際之信用，經近年之國際風波，有待挽回，其威望有待恢復；今乃於整軍經武，其實力足以恢復威望之際，復得外相作此詳明而堅決之表示，自後誰復憂疑於英國外交態度之依然晦澀，依然噯昧哉？故英國外交之入新階段，雖不自今始，然證明其新階段之明朗者，事在隔昨。</p>
<p>哈里法克斯氏演說之外，有足以從旁烘托英國外交態度者，尚有彼國會隔昨開會時，上議院議員薛西爾勛爵、與愛里朋克勛爵，相繼爲遠東而作正氣充沛之演說，下議院議員哈那與羅白資諸氏之質問；凡此數者，俱足象徵英國國會之空氣，非復如曩昔之陰森；原國會而有剛健淸明之空氣，乃爲民治國家確立政策之重要基礎；此其値得稱述，不在外相演說下也。</p>

<p>外相後言及浦東綸昌職員丁格勒遇害案、謂此案事實尙未完全査明、惟政府對於其受傷後與殞命卽之經過事、實殊抱不滿意之觀念、政府巳訓令駐日大使克萊琪提出抗議、並保留要求賠償之權、俟事實査明後、即當提出要求云（十二日路透）、外相對於殖民地問題準備作何讓步、並曰、吾人對所涉及各地之土著、負有甚重資任云、國聯同志會主席薜西爾勳爵額請重定國聯之廣大原則、薛氏之同志台維斯動爵對於外相於六月八日所發之演說、表示不滿、謂其言已引起英國準備與侵略國復作懐疑的勾當之印象、其言曰、英王英后此决在美所博得美國人民之好意與尊敬之情感、上帝禁止以第二慕尼黑打銷之、報界巨子羅塞米兩勳爵謂渠贊助綏靖政策、德國今尙未向英國獨個至關重要之利益挑戰云、</p>
<p>外相答稱、渠於六月八日所發之演說、（宣布英國願在圓桌會議討論德國或他國之耍求）乃因反對黨早已擇定是日辯論外交、無論如何、渠之發表眞相、殊難謂爲過早、或過遲也、關於英蘇談判、今發表詳情、既屬無利、且不可能、此須待外交部專員史德隆在莫斯科討論之、凡與其他政府所的定之一切、均將公布之、頃間史頓海文動爵所提出殖民地間題之一切、政府未嘗須臾忘懐、在目前之階段中、渠對於此事、不欲續有所言、關於但澤問題如須避免嚴重與危險後果、需要極度之忍耐與自制、</p>
<p>外相至是乃重申首相張伯倫所發英國願見波德爭執和平解決、但若欲以武力改變大局而危及波蘭獨立、則勢必釀成涉及英國的燎原大火之言論、外相於辯論結束時、謂六月八日渠所發之演詞、聞者對之加以種種互相矛盾之解釋、有注重詞中此一句者、亦有注重彼一句者、其實此篇演詞、應整個研究之、渠以爲詞旨至爲明顯、乃有人竟謂英國外交政策、已有變更、渠願於此聲明、英國外交政策並無變更、渠六月八日之演詞、欲使國內外人民明瞭政府應付時局之眞相、英國政第中有兩點、渠願說明者、一爲不作威脅、不含陰謀、而欲世人咸了然如用武力、則用之者必遇以力禦力之局勢、二爲如未有訴諸武力之企圖、則不可輕視之、英國力量將傾注以談判謀取公允解決之方面、如此决辯論、能發生轉移各國注意、而知棄用武力的危險方法、改用談判與和解的努力、較爲有益之影響、則渠將欣慰矣云、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）眞理報」木日社論、評及保障波羅的海三國、俾免侵略之問題、文云、「外國報紙近來對於莫洛托夫在最高議會之演說、猶繼續加以批評、允其是對於其中涉及英法蘇三國於波羅的海愛沙尼亞。拉特維亞。及芬蘭三國被侵略而無力自保中立時應加援助之一段、最初一部份外國報紙以爲此項問題、係爲某種未明之作用而人工造成、現在彼等已不得承認此估計爲錯誤、而保障三國中立與蘇聯之安全有極大關係、另一部份則反對此問題之提出、稱其與英法兩國無切實關係、此點之錯誤、彼等亦已承認、目前談判進行情形、表明英法對於維持波羅的海三國中立問題、其關心不下於蘇聯、英國保守黨政治家如邱吉爾者、亦不得不承認此問題於英法十分重要、渠主張以保障給與拉愛芬三國、其言曰、「果立陶宛·拉特維亞。及愛沙尼亞被納粹侵入、或被用內部宣傳及陰謀方法、使其採取納粹制度、則全歐必將捲人戰爭、質言之、即苟三國獨立完整被破壊、波蘭即不得不開戰、從而英法及俄國均不得不開戰、」但大部份外國報紙現在雖承認莫洛托夫援助波羅的海三國之主張、在原則上爲正確、彼等關於此問題、仍不敢從而下應有的實際斷言、一部份人士謂英法蘇之保障、與愛拉芬三國之權利益不符、稱此三國無須外力援助、即足以自保獨立與抵抗侵略、此點自屬錯誤、例如捷克入口及軍隊、即超過三國總數二倍以上、然因孤立無援、結果竟不能自衛、此波雜的三小國父何能優於捷克、由此觀之、三國人民之歡迎和平大國保障獨立、乃自明之理、另有人士則稱、三國如接受强鄰援助、即等於喪失主權及獨立、此說完全荒謬、英國對法國波蘭及土國即有援助之祖保、此諸國亦對英國担保援助、而比利時之巾立則受英法兩國担保、羅馬尼亞及希臘亦受英國担保、此諸國豈因此而遂喪失其主權與獨立最後、猶有一部份英法報界人士則謂、三國官方代表表示拒絕和平國家之援助、稱彼等既無需援助、他國自不能相强、愛沙尼亞外長賽爾特及芬蘭外長歐科即有此項表示、關於此點、其中無誤會則以後有某種惡意破壊和平國家反侵略防禦陣綫組織之企團、本文前已述及三國人民對於己國直接或間接被侵略時和平國家給與之援助，極表歡迎、此爲毋庸之事實、果爾、則賽爾特與歐科父何以拒絕和平國家之援助、此中原因、可能爲上述政治家對於侵略之威脅過份低估、不久前吾八會曾指出羅馬尼亞及波蘭亦有此種低佔傾向、其一部份代表不但反對蘇聯對彼等之担保、並反對英法蘇成立、助協定、嗣後、環境已使此種反對主張收回、在最近的將來、波羅的海三國一部份代表或亦將收回其反對主張、此可能之存在乃因侵略之威脅已日益顯明、美總統羅斯福日前之節略中即曾詳述、同時亦因三國本身利益之必然需要和半國家援助抵抗侵略、將使彼等認識更淸、然而關於愛芬兩國上述政治家之態度、似仍有另一種解釋、彼等曾受國外之影饗、顯屬完全可能、即使並非被力圖妨害反侵略廣大陣錢組成之徒直接操縱、目前操縱者爲誰、吾人實難斷言、侵略國自存心破壊、但民主國家內部亦有某部份反動勢力力圖僅於某某區域限制侵略、而聽其猖獗於他處、法國資產階級右派名記者如亨利·喀里利·亦認此假定爲可能、實屬極重要之徵兆、由此觀之、對於莫洛托夫氏關於保障波羅的海三國免受侵略之最後反對理山、自和平國家反侵略陣綫之利益觀之、亦屬毫無根據、與其他各項相同、因此、蘇聯關於保障波羅的海三國免于侵略之立塲、實爲唯一正確之立塲、而與一切愛好和平國家連愛沙尼亞·拉特維亞。及芬蘭三國在內之之利益完全相符、（十三日塔斯電）</p>

<p>岱山登陸之日軍、査係第一掃海司令賀尹所部、的有陸戰隊三百餘人、分駐東沙角·高亭·北峯山等處、但東沙角各街弄連日發境日文反戰傳單甚多、日本軍官無力統制現泊岱日艦五艘、又運輸艦一艘、武裝漁輪一艘、汽艇甚多、</p>
<h3>青浦日軍　挖掘酒瓶山</h3>
<p>千年古蹟被毀</p>
<p>靑浦通訊、縣屬舊靑涌鎮、居靑龍港之畔、鎭西里許有一酒瓶山、爲宋朝韓世忠犒軍之古蹟、酒瓶堆積如山故名、曾一度被農民挖掘、以善價出售完整者每枚値價數十元、幸即被當局嚴禁、至今古蹟尙存、民國二十二年春、縣黨部會同縣敎育局於該山四週、圍以木柵、並往立碑石、以誌紀念、戰前遠近來遊者頗衆、不料今竟爲日方覬覦、强迫附近鄉民、代爲挖掘、千年古蹟因此全毀、</p>
<h3>阜寗日軍　搜索民居</h3>
<p>各市鎭亦遭燒燬</p>
<p>阜寗通信、阜寗曾於去夏被日軍佔踞、五十餘日即退、所有城中房屋、被燒大半、今年二月間、二决失陷、日軍僅二百餘人、未敢下鄉滋擾、惟射陽湖口、日艦時至、汽油船往來、時常靠岸、居民聞風、逃避一空、日軍遂搜索兩岸居戶衣服什物食糧等、裝運出海、最近阜寗匪首朱保元·郭六·顧某等股匪三叫百人、受日軍利用、先後往東溝·益林·鳳谷村·獐溝等鎭、將商店貨物搶刦一空、復將蛤蜊港八灘·蔡家橋·三截溝·二場·等鎭民房、燒燬盡凈、本月四日、日軍與游擊彖在二塌地方開火、日軍死傷四十餘名、日汽油船被轟況四隻、現各處難民、露宿野田、哭聲振天、慘不忍聞、</p>

<h3>本埠連日盛傳　有人威脅英大使　恐嚇方式係利用傳言　大使已採取必要戒備</h3>
<p>海通社倫敦十三日電、據「每日導報」載、英國駐華大使寇爾、現因日來收到警吿信多件、令其小心生命、故現時隨時均有保鑣多人、環立身旁、大使及大使館員、均着避彈衣、以備不虞、</p>
<p>字林報云、鑒於駐華英大使寇爾爵士生命之受威脅、故昨日（十二日）午後公共租界警務處在英大使館與惇信路五十號大使邸中採取特殊防範、大使館辦公處、設於怡和大厦、該厦入口處與大廳中、駐有衣制服之中西警務人員、六樓全部、均屬大使館辦公室、該樓兩電梯前、各駐華捕一名、記者入總辦公室、見西探五人、坐候室中、目視辦公室入口處不移、</p>
<p>大使未獲　恐嚇函件</p>
<p>記者叩諸大使館某高級人員、渠不願披露威脅之性質、惟聞諸非官塲方面、英大使未接恐嚇函、昨晚另一方面稱、警方已得關於圖謀不軌之情報、故取防範</p>
<p>汽車前後　武裝護衛</p>
<p>昨日午後將近五時四十五分、寇爾爵士離大使館時、步行入汽車、坐右側、御鋼絲馬甲之探員與大使秘書各二人、均坐車後部、衣制服之警務處人員、乘馬達自行車行於大使汽車前、車後則有警務汽車一輛、內乘御鋼絲馬甲之探員三人、均持手槍待發、自後保護大使、</p>
<p>官邸亦取　相當戒備</p>
<p>大使邸中亦取相類之戒備、內外均駐西探、並聞已加派常駐衛兵、邸後亦駐有衣制服之警務處人員、西探一名、竚立鐵門外、門內則有荷槍上槍刺之衛兵一名駐立、</p>
<p>恐嚇之來　出諸傳言</p>
<p>大陸報云、駐華英大使寇爾爵士、因接激烈性質之恫嚇、故惇信路五十號大使邸內與外灘二十七號英大使館辦公處各點、均駐額外之軍警、以資保護、恫嚇之確實性質、未經披露、惟大使館某員昨（十二日）晚語記者稱、已有人向英大使恫嚇所接恐嚇、非以函件方式、而藉外界傳言之方法出之、</p>
<p>警務方面　從事偵査</p>
<p>聞大使係週杪得恫嚇之通知、警務處得轉報、立即採取戒備、英大使館與警務處均重視此事、而取一切可能之辦法、星期六日晚、大使邸內加駐警務人員與西福資隊英兵一隊、昨晨、外灘英大使館房屋內亦駐有巡捕、靜安寺捕房西探亦於大使往返寓邸與辦公室時、襄助保護、據英大使館與警務處人員聲稱、一切恫嚇、無論其出諸幻想者、諧謔者、或確有不軌之圖者、必加以偵査、寇爾爵士旣接恐嚇、不得不嚴密戒備也、</p>
<h3>滬市銅輔幣缺乏後　妥籌補救辦法　准發分幣券以資週轉　郵票代替係臨時性質</h3>
<p>上海市塲之舊銅元銅幣爲奸商牟利搜羅、以致發生嚴重缺乏現象各業除以郵票印花等代替外、並由市商會電則部迅籌補救辦法、同時中央銀行滬行、亦已呈報總行、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>中央銀行　呈報經過</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、各業除以郵票印花代替銅幣使用外、並由市商會電財政部迅籌補救辦法、同時中央銀行上海分行、亦已將上海銅幣缺乏原因及經過、呈報總行、轉財政部核辦、聞財政部已交錢幣司長研究考慮補救辦法、對繼續將外埠各造幣廠所鑄之新銅幣運滬接濟、認爲不妥、因如果再大批運滬、勢必爲奸商再行搜羅私運出口、且海外銅價飛漲、某方軍火商人需耍正殷、至於發行分幣券問題、認爲可行最近期內、即有辦法、</p>
<p>盼望財部　藎籌速決</p>
<p>昨日盛傳有人觀察鎳幣中所含成分有限、一分銅幣中所含銅質亦無幾、對於某方重價收購之說、認爲不足置信、而目下銅鎳幣竟告缺乏者、乃奸商屯積居奇所造成、因此銀錢業領袖有聯電財政部、建議迅運大量輔幣來滬接濟云云、新新社記者、曾向銀錢業探詢究竟、未能徵實、惟據銀行中人談、銅元缺乏、係奸商屯積、可謂原因之一、而每年五千萬銅元之出口事實、殊難爲無人收購作强辯、惟各界切望財部早籌補救辦法、實已人同此心、而對財部發行一分二分五分銅幣券、則尤爲殷切、蓋繼續運銅鎳輔幣來滬、勢必仍爲奸商所吸收、而私運出口、缺乏銅元恐慌、雖暫可吿消弭、終難免重吿發生恐慌、故望財政當局藎籌速決、早日解除全市五百萬市民、因銅元缺乏所感受之痛苦、</p>
<p>發代價券　務須愼重</p>
<p>各業對於零數交易、因銅元之缺乏、不得已以郵票或印花代替之、以致郵票成爲目前之通用籌碼、各項交易起碼爲一分、造成無形之中提高物價、以前售銅元一枚或二枚之貨、今均提高爲一分、惟熟水店之交易、則以自製之竹籌使用之、公共汽車公司、除將已收回之代幣、重行發出、以利找頭外、並與電車公司聯合通吿、「茲因市上銅幣及五分鎳幣異常缺乏、乘客車資、務請以確數付給、以免無從找付、特此登報公吿、諸希亮鑒、」聞發行代價券已實行者、爲北福建路市聯第三十七區分會會員商店、計發一分二分兩種、現新閘路市聯第十六區分會、亦定今日下午四時邀集各會員商店、討論發行代價券、惟據新新社記者探悉、商店印製代價券應用、解除目前困難、雖可得一部份同情、但就大體而言、固屬不當、因此種代價券、旣無規定準備金、叉無監督機關、不但流弊孔多、抑且涉有私自發行鈔券之嫌、深望各商店愼考盧、勿貽後患</p>
<p>權力不及　取締困難</p>
<p>中央造幣廠上海廠所鑄成新輔幣、共一分銅幣、至前年七月底停工爲止、爲九萬二千七百六十五萬八千三百二十枚、均由中央銀行絡續發行流通滬地、今竟爲奸商牟利搜羅、由滬私運出口、供給某方充作兵工器材、聞每銅幣一百枚、能獲利二角、至於銅元、中之光緒大淸、幣質尤佳、故獲利尤重、雖財政部一再佈告取締査辦、奈因上海地處淪陷區域、爲政府權力所不及、所以中行決中止接濟滬市之銅幣、</p>
<p>浦東又籌備　反英遊行</p>
<p>浦東綸昌廠事件、僞方新申報昨日宜傳、謂公司當局、已由總經理英人辛克勒委託日方調解工潮、由日介紹與僞「市府」會晤云云、以圖對外緩和空氣、一方面又在浦東籌備大規模之排英游行、的定本星期四實行、屆時仍迫綸昌無知工人前往參加、傳遊行途徑、較前數决爲遠、且將向白蓮涇綸昌老廠示威、足見前項宣傳、僅存掩飾偽方之反英活動、以便屆時將反英遊行之發動、完全推在工人頭上、</p>
<p>由滬開湖州　民船被扣無踪</p>
<p>上海至湖州航班、甫於最近恢復通航、昨據內河航業界消息、日前由滬開往民船航班一艘、駛抵八尺附近突被襲擊扣留、迄無下落、該船載有大批貨物、損失不少、現浙西各地、水陸航班、因情形不安、行駛困難、已呈完全停頓狀態、</p>
<h3>外輪違反命令　應受停航處分　德平輪不及遵守防守部命令　經甬當局從寬處分扣留十天</h3>
<p>大光社云、意商中意輸船公司之德平輸、於三日在甬時、週遇日機九度襲甬、該輸未及經過軍警機關檢査、即行由下白沙江面啟椗駛滬、致被寗波防守司令部認爲違反命令、該輸於九日晨再度駛甬後、即遭扣留十天之處分、現仍滯甬、須俟扣留期滿後、方得裝貨返滬、</p>
<p>被扣原因　又有一說</p>
<p>新聲社云、寗波溫台兩防守司令、爲疏通貨運起見、特准寗波溫州通航、惟規定寗波進口船隻、限於裝載食米等貨、今有意商中意公司之德平輸、由滬裝貨駛甬、該地當局因該輪並未裝米、當予停航之處分、旋經該公司一再要求通融後、始得當局之諒解、予以停航一班處分、現該輪定明後日由甬返滬、至於上海定海綫之德商遠東公司哈納輸、已於昨晨由定抵滬、准今晨四時繼續駛定、惟奉當局命令、絕對禁止搭客、</p>
<p>甬籍旅客　在定被阻</p>
<p>滬甬航綫、自經寗波防守司令部奉令核准恢復後、所有原駛各輸、即經先後復航、惟當局祇准裝運貨物、絕對禁止搭客、致滬甬兩地人士、往返受阻、深感不便、自德商哈納輪於五日復航定海後、一般欲由甬來滬之旅客、多先期搭高登輸至定候輸、以便轉搭來滬、乃定海當局、以各輪禁止載客、奉有命令、故哈納輸啟椗時、絕對不准附載、雖經疏通、卒未蒙獲准、故甬籍旅客約三百餘人、悉數被阻、精形殊爲狼狽、聞哈納輪已於昨晨由定返滬、定今日下午四時、仍駛往定海、聞此次已蒙核准、附載定海籍旅客、</p>
<p>絕對禁止　各輸搭客</p>
<p>又德商禮和洋行謀福輪於前晨到滬、業於昨日下午四時啟椗駛甬、至留甬之英商太古洋行新北京輪、則於昨晨由甫返滬、已於昨日下午六時半抵埠、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭、今晨起卸來貨、惟各輪均以裝貨爲限、絕對禁止載客</p>

<h3>經濟侵略之一種　日方統制棉產計劃　設立所謂「棉産協進會」　南京及大塲設立試驗場</h3>
<p>自日方發動侵華戰事以來、爲實施其經濟侵略計劃起見、在各佔領區域、積極囊括資源、並利用僞組織、藉合作提携之美名、組織各種工商業機關、如「華中公司」等、企圖控制華中各項事業、而於棉產一項、進行尤爲積極、曾由日方發起成立「棉產協進會」、最近該會復擴大組織、資本增至三十萬元、由中日各半負擔、「總裁」爲日前在南京中毒之「行政院長」梁鴻志、「會長」王子惠、「副會長」沈能毅·小寺、惟實際權力、則操諸彼方、華人僅供驅使、刻聞已在本市大塲及南京中山門外附近、設立棉種試騐塲、由日人播原池田兩人擔任技術員、即將開始植棉、</p>

<h3>日如圖謀租界　將引起悲慘後果　紐約時報遠東經理所譚　上海方面注視天津局勢　蘇州河南日僑將遷河北</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、紐的時報遠東經理阿本德氏、近偕友赴日本作短遊、然後返美、阿氏來華已十三年、今爲其五年中第一决請假返國、其旅日時、會對客申明改革上海公共租界之要求、日本難望第三方面列强遽予接受、蓋此事甚形複雜、須逐步解決也、據阿氏聲稱、改革公共租界之市政、牽涉良多、此種事件、絕對不能在此時迅予解決、若操切從事、徒足擾亂租界、毫無裨益、日本近要求有關係的列强改革租界之行政機構、難望列强即予接受、日本如藉武力佔據租界、則其後果之慘烈、將不堪設想、蓋恐怖份子或將乘機活動、而嫁禍於日本、以圖陷日本於困難地位也、</p>
<p>目前狀況　甚形安謐</p>
<p>租界中目前之狀況、甚形安謐、因工部局官員嚴加戒防、將一切有恐怖嫌疑之華人逐出租界、故租界內之和平與秩序、均能善加維持、阿氏又言及目前之中日戰事、謂戰事將歷時久長、無人能知其何時結束、因雙方之軍力與財力、外間未能得悉其眞相、殊難遽作豫料也、</p>
<p>解決懸案　應求忍耐</p>
<p>惟日本如欲儘速結束中國事件、續派大軍十五萬名、前至中國、而使游擊隊無活動之餘地、實爲絕對必要之舉、華軍現對日軍空襲、不甚畏懼、且中國未建有大兵工廠、値得轟炸、中國預防轟炸、故所建兵工廠、規模既小、且散播各地、每所所値、充量不出千鎊耳、阿氏未謂在華日當局與外國當局雖有多種懸案正待解決、然表面尙稱友好、日本於解決許多問題、當出以忍耐、此點日當局已知之矣、</p>
<p>丁案未了　强暴日甚</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、在華日本陸海軍當局間之强暴、有增無已、已致上海之丁格勒於死地、今且導使採取特殊戒備，保護駐華英大使寇爾之生命、自星期六日起、駐守惇信路五十號大使邸中之西福資英兵與巡捕、增加倍餘、大使乘車出行、兩側由穿鋼絲馬甲之探員保護、皆日方威脅之結果也、</p>
<p>綸昌工人　被阻入廠</p>
<p>日方在浦東陸家嘴綸昌紡織廠主持罷工風潮後、丁格勒遭慘死、當鼓動者偕欲復工之僱工强入該廠時、悉遭拘捕、然鼓動者設法竄離其日方保護、逕奔電力間、圖加損壊、丁氏即在該地鳴槍一響、圖嚇阻日兵不予管東之煽動者、竟成日兵注意之的、去其槍而用槍刺猛戳之、已往數日內、持械之羣、曾在白蓮涇綸昌印花厰開槍、嚇阻僱工、不敢返廠、日方除僱用此單持械之羣外、並在浦東張貼反英排外傳單甚多、</p>
<p>本埠關懷天津局勢　上海方面除注視本埠局勢外、並深爲關切天津之局勢、該地日軍雖明言照顧第三國利益、然似已準備於明日（十四日）封鎖英法租界矣、本埠消息稱、居住蘇州河南岸公共租界或法租界之日僑、已得遷入蘇州河北岸之令、違者以收回護照處罰、此舉與遷出天津英法租界相類、觀於若干日商行在蘇州河南岸自有房屋、自外灘之橫濱正金銀行、以至宜昌路區之紗廠、此舉頗爲嚴峻、即日籍婦人與外人同居於南岸者、亦已接得遷往北岸之令云、</p>

<h3>工部局對物價　尙無統制趨勢　惟主要物品達「飢饉點」時　工部局始將運用特殊勢力</h3>
<p>發言人非正式表示</p>
<p>大陸報云、本埠物價、繼續高漲、至空前水準、一般食物價格、約漲什三、昨據工部局發言人非正式語記者云、惟米等主要物品、達「飢饉點」時、工部局始將運用特殊權力、統制上漲之價格云、此與華籍人民、尤有關係、工部局方面昨未正式發言、局方今日（十三日）午後四時三十分開董事會、不致討論此事、</p>
<p>此種局勢不能長久　消息靈通方面相信，無論法幣如何、此種局勢、乃暫有之事、蓋供求律將調整局勢、若有抬高價格、以貿利者、他人將定較低之價、以廣招徠也、衆信若米價高漲、造成米之飢僅狀况、工部局將據一九三七年軍興後米荒時之先例、而運米入口、按照規定之合理價格出售之、</p>
<p>觀察現象勢難平抑　西藥亦已漲價、據拜耳藥厰稱、該厰藥物均已高漲什三、他如橡皮物品、出租汽車、舶來香烟、等、莫不漲價、啤酒雖仍維持原價、惟據現象察之、不久亦將漲價、勢所難免也、</p>
<p>消費繁榮難期持久　據某金融家談、目前滬市繁榮僅屬於消費方面、難期持久、此其原因、不外避難來滬者、日久資斧漸罄、將無以爲繼、邇來匯價又吿緊縮、各項物價、均見上漲、市民購買力之日趨降低、實極爲顯見者、自匯價緊縮後、洋貨均吿漲價、而與洋貨直接間接有關係之貨亦均吿漲、如汽油·煤油·五金·煤炭·出租汽車·紙張·疋頭·皮革·搪瓷·鋼精·油漆·螺絲釘·等、其他各種日用品、莫不一律上漲、最近復因銅鎳輔幣缺乏、零找困難、一般市儈、唯利是圖、將零數改爲整數、實行其乘火打刦變相之加價、</p>
<p>非常時期提倡國貨　在此非常時期、各種物價、因交通阻塞、及供求不能平衡、投機者從中操縱等原因、本已較戰前提高、惟洋貨漲價、固爲我人所歡迎、蓋舶來品上漲、對於國貨銷路、有莫大助益、惟國貨廠商、切勿乘機提高物價、予民衆以不良印象、因在此一片漲價聲中、素有積蓄者、當可應付、一般薪水階級及勞力同胞、已感生計困難、呌苦不止矣、</p>

<h3>中国職業敎育概况（六）　三年內完成邊省職敎　職校及學生數均增加</h3>
<p>國立職校</p>
<p>自中央盡力提倡職業敎育以後、各省市職業學校日見增設、惟大都困於經費、每多因陋就簡、內容未能充實、除由敎部派員視察督促改進外、並於二十五年籌設中央工業職職業學校於南京、以示模楷、其設科爲機械、應用化舉、土木·電機四科、二十六年八二二戰起、該校即由京遷至四川萬縣、二十七年又由萬縣遷至重慶、現計本科八級、訓練班兩級、共學生四百餘人、</p>
<p>中央護士及職業助產學校、原附設於衛生署中央醫院、二十五年改歸敎部直轄、經費亦單獨列支、中央助產學校、由南京遷至安慶、二十七年又由安慶遷至重慶、現有四級、計學生八十餘人、中央護士學校、由京隨中央醫院遷至長沙、二十七年由長沙遷至貴陽、計學生六十餘人、</p>
<p>此外國立第一助產學校及國立同濟大學附設高級工業職業學校、均於二十年前後成立、班級學生、尙稱發達、國立貴陽醫學院高級醫事職業科、於二十六年度成立、招收戰區助產及護士學校各年級學生、規模粗具、</p>
<p>邊省職敎</p>
<p>二十七年、敎部爲極力推進西北西南各省農工職敎起見、特頒行陝甘寗靑川康雲貴桂各省批進農工職業敎育計劃、計分西北川康及西南三區、其重要原則如下、（一）每區各省應參照省內農工職業及原料分佈情形、規定設置高初級農工各科職校地點及設科、（二）職業學校之設施、必要時可先成立工廠或農塲、視其需要、訓練少數藝徒、逐漸擴充爲學校、（三）職業學校之一切設施、應由廳局會同同性質之高等敎育及生產機關、規劃指導、（四）此項分區推進方案、應於三年內完成、以上計劃、令各省迅速會商有關機關、擬具實施方案、呈部核定、現已有多數省份遵照辦理、</p>
<p>合作輔導</p>
<p>中央爲謀建設與敎育事業之切實聯絡、溝通供求需要及增加敎育與事業效率起見、於二十五年制定職業學校與建設機關協作大綱、通令各學校應與校外生產實習機關、詳定分派學生實習方法、並指導考核實習成績、同年又頒布職業學校設置顧問委員會辦法、令各校聘請與學校同性質之農工商醫各界專家或領袖五人至七人、組織委員會、商討關於學生之服務道德、精神訓練、敎材選擇、實習指導、及就業等事項、二十六年、中央成立建敎合作委員會、由敎育·經濟·交通·軍政·內政·航空委員會等部會、分派代表合組而成、以敎部主持之、其任務爲調查各項技術人才、編製各項統計、擬定各級職業學校及專科大學設科計劃與敎學訓練方案、籌擬敎育與建設國防機關聯絡辦法、以及統籌畢業生出路等等、尙有相當結果、</p>
<p>二十八年、敎部爲增進職業學校之設施有效計、又頒布各省市分區轉導職業學校辦法大綱、令各省市敎育廳局應與省內外專科以上學校及生產紅濟軍事工業機關、密切聯絡、並劃分職業學校區、分別邀請以上學校及機關專員學術及技能上輔導之責、俾職業學校隨時均有協助督促之便利、一切用人行政及敎學、均須以輔導機關之意見爲依據、</p>
<p>職敎統計</p>
<p>中國職業敎育、自政府努力推行以來、扣至抗戰前一年、可得如左之統計、其中尙有一大部分護士助產學校不在其內、（一）學校數四○八校、（二）學級數一七三六級、（三）學生數五〇二〇五人、（四）敎職員數七八八一人、（五）經費數八二二八一七六元、以上統計、較之民國二十三年厲行中等學校設置及經費支配標準時之校數三一二所、約增加四分之一、其他如學生經費等項、亦各增四分之一、此外學校之設備、敎學出路等等、雖不能爲數量之表現、但就敎部觀察所得、似皆有相當之進步也、（完）</p>

<p>科學與人生</p>
<h3>提高與推廣</h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>科學足以造福國家，有識者皆承認之。其所以能產生最大效力，使國家社會深受其益者，必在」國之內，專門之知識技能特別發達，舉凡國家之重要問題，可藉此以資解決。又必科學之常識，習慣，思想及精神普遍於社會，將全國之入民，納入科學之正軌，然後人民富於自治之能力，社會有安定之秩序，蒸蒸日上，優秀之分子，因之日多，處國競劇烈之世界，可以卓然永存，而不受天演之淘汰。一言以蔽之：卽專門之科學須盡量促進，而科學之常識宜極力推廣也。十九世紀之中，英人赫胥黎氏深明此義，盡平生之力，從事於此一途。當其時，科學在英國已甚發達，專門大家如來雅爾，達爾文，胡克爾，沃來斯，湯穆生（卽凱爾文爵士），丁度爾，戈爾登，諸人之貢獻，震驚全世，開科學界之新紀元。赫氏與此數人爲摯友，其個人在科學上之貢獻，又有極大之價値，窮年矻矻，竭其全力於高深之研究。然於百忙之中，仍從事推廣科學敎育之工作，爲工人演講，爲所有不習科學之人，在國內各報章發表無數之淺易科學文字，終其身幾將所有時間精力，盡用之於科學之推廣與專門之著述。其結果也，英國社會乃大受影饗，科學常常識幾於家喩戶曉，人民之智識水準因之增長，敎育制度因之改進，國內有無數專家出而應國家之急需，英國自十九世紀以來，所以日臻郅治，爲世界第一强國也。吾國今日，需用科學方股，國內有志之靑年，欲從事救國之事業，而對科學深感興趣者，其一面努力於高深之造詣，一面輔助科學之普遍化，取法於赫氏之所爲哉。</p>
<h3>燈與燭</h3>
<p>— 心織</p>
<p>焚膏繼晷以取光明，燈燭之用由來已久。要皆不出於燃燒之作用。惟電燈則於取光法，始獨闢途徑。初民知藉燃燒以取光，故採天然之物可燃者而燃之。油燈之用當較燭爲古。最初之燭爲動物之油脂所製。以蘆梗爲芯，蘸融化之牛油，至再至三而成。及百年前，化學知識進步，製燭之法亦由粗而精。蓋以脂肪油類之化學成分，爲法人休佛婁所研究。知一切動植物之脂肪，外觀雖逈不相同，然均有相似之內構，實爲甘油與有機酸，如硬脂酸，軟脂酸，液脂酸，所成之化合物也。如以動物脂肪如牛油製燭，則甘油與液脂酸之化合物，因易烊而致燭之流淚。且燃時甘油變成一種異臭之物質。故近世製燭先以牛油與調酸之水共煮，使脂肪與纖維質分開，再加石灰，受高熱之蒸汽，則分解成甘油與各有機酸，卽硬脂酸·軟脂酸·液脂酸是也。蒸餾之後，用壓榨去其液脂酸。剩餘之固體含硬脂酸或司的令」爲多。略加石蠟　，即可成造燭之原料。造成之燭潔白堅硬，不汚手指，燃時光明無烟，亦不流淚，自較舊時之牛油燭優良多矣。</p>
<p>石蠟一種亦可製燭。惟受熱易軟化，不及硬脂酸所製者　。石蠟乃多種氫炭兩質之化合物混和所成之物。與脂酸性質逈不相同。得之石油或製自褐一煤（德國法）。煉純後始可用以一製燭。此外有蜂蠟，性質絕類一油脂，亦曾用以製燭。又如鯨一油所製之燭，爲測定光度所用一之標準，以其光燄大而齊整。一電燈泡之以燭光計，即取義於一鯨油燭也。</p>
<p>製燭之材料雖均可燃，但一不成氣則不能燃。故溫度必高一至可使變氣，始得燃而成燄。燭之始燃也，芯上之油酸或蠟化氣而燃，立見明燄。惟不久即衰。須待下部之燭油烊化，一始能復明。燃油藉毛細管之作用，沿芯上升，與捲紙一端矗立水中，全捲盡濕同一作用。燭油近燄因熱而氣化，著火則成燄。四圍空氣因火燄之熱而流動，聚而上升，燭之四周，藉此冷而不融，成盛油之盤。油之不決口而流，正以此也。</p>
<p>舊時燭芯時須剪除，其故由於燭芯爲油氣所包，不得與氧氣接觸，無充分之燃燒。直立燄中，燭油循之上升，亦不得全燃。燭芯若不剪去，則燭燄不明而有烟，故非剪不可。及法人拱白偲發明以紗辦爲芯，燃後卽不須再剪。蓋芯長則捲，捲曲則與空氣相接，自然燒盡矣。芯之粗細鬆緊亦須合度，乃得圓滿之結果。芯之曾以硝製煉者，更可使燭不烟而無燼（即燭花）。</p>
<p>油燈中所焚之油，其始爲植物油。及石油發見之後，價値較廉，漸取以代植物油。石油乃由地中掘井汲取之，爲太古時之海棲動植物，受久遠之熱壓作用所化成。含種種炭氫之化合物，有爲氣體，自地穴中散出，是爲大然煤氣。有爲液體固體。故石油入蒸餾器蒸之，熱至攝氏四十度至九十度之閒所得者爲汽油。九十度與百二十度之間所得者爲揮發油·百二十度至百五十度之間所得者爲輕油。百五十度至三百度之間所得者爲燈用油，卽煤油或洋油。以後所得爲機器油，凡士林，石蠟。以上種種均爲炭氫族之混合物。氣體中之最簡單者曰沼氣，以在池沼中刺撥池底之泥所發之氣泡，遇火可燃，卽此是也。亦爲天然煤氣中之主耍成分。</p>
<p>煤油燃燒時若無充分之空氣，則氧化不完，乃有烟燄。非用有玻璃罩之燈及供充足之氧氣不可。其燈心帶之成圓圈者，更須有中空之管，使火燄之內部亦得與空氣接觸。此卽近代煤油燈構造之原理也。</p>
<h3>科學聊齋</h3>
<p>— 禾山</p>
<p>狼一</p>
<p>英人某，游歷阿斯圖利亞（Ａsturis）地方。見羣馬逐尋水草，散佈山坡閒。倐有數狼奄至，將噬其幼者。老馬急構成一環，幼子圍繞於中，老馬之首皆外向。狼咄咄進迫，一狼猛銜而入，老馬當之者，以前蹄力擊之而斃焉。於是相持移時，狼知不可輕犯，旋即捨之而去。</p>

<p>又克魯地亞（Ｃroutia）山中，有牧童牧豕，遇二狼至，驚懼不知所出，急捨其豕而隱避焉。旋見其豕聚集成楔形之陣，向狼緩緩進攻，背鬃豎立，時作沉怒嘶聲。一狼見其怒不可犯，即逸去。其他狼竄避大樹上，衆豕全樹下而團團包圍之，狼見逼，欲突圍而出，驟由樹上躍下。衆豕擠而踣之，努力奮擊，齒蹄齊加，須臾而斃。</p>
<p>狼三</p>
<p>達爾文氏亦言野牛（Bison）能互助禦侮，每遇狼之見侵。輙將其幼子置於　之中央。老牛皆以首當其衝，作怒視狀，且其首之角，堪作抗敵之武器，列戟森森，狼畏其强，知近逼必無幸焉，雖急欲進攻，逡巡趦趄，而卒不得逞。</p>
<p>異史氏曰：甚矣，團結之不可以少也，處無事之時，能獲出入相友之益，處危急之秋，能免各個擊破之禍，馬，牛，豕，尙然，可以人而不如獸乎。</p>
<h3>紐約世界博覽會的　游客紀數機</h3>
<p>— 葉人</p>
<p>美國一家「現金紀數機」的制造商建造了一架世界最大的紀數機，裝在最近在紐約開幕的世界博覽會會場中，以便逐日記載到會遊覽的人數。凡有遊客進入會塲大門時，該機即發鈴聲一響·記錄牌轉動，加上一數。此機高四十英尺，裝置在該製造商陳列館的屋頂，能在轉台上慢慢轉動，使機頂上高六英尺的照亮記錄數碼字，日夜被全會塲的人看到。</p>

<h3>「則歸墨」</h3>
<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>記得紅樓夢裏賈氏家塾的老先生曾經出過這個八股題。現在時代已更，八股當然談不到了，此處之所謂「墨」，旣不願照原文之意而捧墨子登塲，也不敢神經過敏而以墨索里尼爲對像。那麼，墨就是Ｘ，就是Ｙ，暫作代數符號用。</p>
<p>人類的心理，必得有所歸依，或爲宗敎，或爲主義，或如烈士之殉名，或如貪夫之殉財，說牠是信仰固可，說牠是迷信也可。一旦失其所歸，往往自覺如大海孤舟，有漂泊無際之感。明白了這一點，我們可以解釋若干人生現象了。</p>
<p>這裏所說，都是卑之無甚高論，且拿兩件事實來作個例子就算了。第一，我們在報上常見馬寳的廣吿，倒底怎樣一回事。原來這是很古的一種信仰，大槪在波斯與阿刺伯頗爲盛行，後來傳入東亞西歐。當時的帝王或權貴最怕被人置毒暗殺，於是需要一種隨身的自衛法寳，這就是馬寳交運的時候了。他們把馬寳或置於飲器之底，或絡以金絲，進食、時以之接觸每樣食物，一經接觸則百毒俱解云云。關於治病方面，則將馬寳磨成細粉，內服外用，百病可治云云。然則馬寳究竟是什麽東西？牠是動物體內的結石；或在胃，或在胆，或在膀胱。而且身懷此寳者不必一定是馬，在藥材方面有的用羊寳，有的用牛寳，有的用豬寳，有的用駝寳。最貴的是羊寳（波斯羊），而吾國獨以馬寳稱。我想，人爲萬物之靈，假使一旦發見人寳，豈不大妙。然而廣束梅縣的醫院裏，人寳堆積如小山，一一自嘆命薄，不知所歸——這都是人體的膀胱結石。</p>
<p>第一，我們常以「千人針」一類的護身符爲談助，不知這是東亞與西歐互相媲美的。產婦的胎胞亦是迷信所寄的一種東西；如果與胎兒俱下而尙未破裂者，名曰福胞，那更了不得。英國人習於航海，但也怕溺死，於是以福胞爲護身符，謂佩此者得免滅頂之凶。福胞交運時，每具値二十金磅。以後航術猛進，危機大减，而福胞之價亦大跌。然距今二十三年前（一九一六，世界大戰時），因德國潛水艇之不時襲繫而福胞重復交運，每具漲價至三金磅。難道當時英國的科學還不發達嗎？那裏，這是與科學發達沒有關係的，這就所謂「則歸墨」。</p>
<p>安居孤島的人們也許要鄙夷一笑，然而慢來；試看多少華屋，牆上不還掛着八卦嗎，多少汽車，裏邊不還掛着小福神嗎，試想親友之中，不還有「君子無故，玉不去身」的嗎（據說佩玉可防跌傷）？凡此瑣屑，今日之歐美亦不能盡免，這是無可如何的「則歸墨」。</p>

<h3>治早洩腎虧應用　何種內分泌劑？</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞大醫科畢業楊道南醫師著</p>
<p>腎虧的原因，都由於睪丸中內分泌枯竭所致。此多屬婚前自凟過度，荒淫斵傷而來，蓋本來性的接觸係因大腦的中樞先感受刺戟。精神上發生興奮，因而傳達到脊髓中之勃起中樞與射精中樞，使之亢奮，更進一步使全身的筋肉與內臟各器官亢奮，故一個男子因房事所費之精力，等於八小時的勞動，若是荒淫放縱，當然身體上要發生弊害的，至於自凟，則更較尋常房事爲損傷身體，因自凟價祇憑自己的空思幻想以喚起色情，而且容易陷於過度，故其結果，每多釀成早洩，陰痿及神經衰弱等症。</p>
<p>我們站在臨床醫家的第一線，對於每個病人自不得不追溯其病源。同時對於層出不窮所出現的新藥，不可祇憑附屬於各藥之簡短說明，而决定其效力。庶不致於在臨床上失信於病家。</p>
<p>講到治療此種疾病的藥劑，自當以內分泌劑爲最效，但內分泌劑種類綦多，然對於腎虧一症之治療，厥惟靑春腺內分泌製齊男用一補體康」，它不僅是生殖機能衰弱的補給療法，而且能改善調和全身的狀態，故對患神經衰弱症，發育不全，未老先衰，早洩遺精等症，能發揮充分之效力。</p>
<p>至於「補體康」一藥之臨一床功效，各國醫家都有詳盡的記載。自從一九三四年，法國名醫佛蘭斯登博士作三十次以上之化騐後，證實該劑之效力，爲一切內分泌劑之冠，遂風行全球，繼起者爲意大利名醫斯托克霍姆博士，氏擇其初生最孱弱之黑熊，將「補體康」混入乳汁飼之，一星期後，竟較其他黑熊大幾逾倍，氏非常滿意，認爲各種同樣內分泌劑所不及，其門徒Starling氏曾以該劑治愈三千垂危之腎虧病例，美國名醫托爾司泰氏，積九年之經騐，亦稱該劑最爲完善，其女用者爲調經種子聖藥，在婦科藥中久負盛名。</p>

<h3>紐西倫花柳病院發表　淋濁特效治績</h3>
<p>— （美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師撰）</p>
<p>紐西倫花柳病院，每年必發表對於花柳病中各種療法，如電療，手術，內服藥等，皆有嚴格之分析與就計，覺得淋病之療法，惟德國彼德博士發明之淋病特效藥「克淋儂」爲最。該院淋病主任翰維爾博士作精密之統計，急性淋服「克淋儂」三四瓶，百人中則有九十七人全部治愈。經過十五决以上之檢騐血液，及用攝護腺按摩法，均證明已完全根治。</p>
<p>翰維爾博士又用一般之化學療法，及透膜療法等爲試騐，則百人中之獲愈者，不過三四名，而且依然有再發之弊。因之，「克淋儂」一藥。遂爲舉世醫家一致公認之淋病特效藥。</p>
<p>美國拉維斯博士，會在本雪文尼州之醫院中，亦發表關於「克淋儂」一藥之治愈成績，證明翰維爾博士之說，拉博士云，對於治淋之藥，余試用屢矣，而其成績總不及「克淋儂」者。良以此劑所根據之學理，是採用非特異性療法，與一般化學療法，透膜殺菌療法，大異其趣，凡男女急慢性淋病，余用「克淋儂」治療，其治愈成績爲百分之九六·八。任何現在之淋病內服藥，均無此種崇高之治績也。至於外用藥方面，男子可外用「抗淋水」，女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，按圖與說明書在家自行洗滌，則奏功允偉矣。蓋自「克淋儂」一藥發明後，無限之男女淋病患者，均受此藥之賜而完全脫離此苦。宜爲醫家對此藥刮目相看也</p>
<h3>肺癆的爲害</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺病是剝奪人類生命最烈的病症，且爲人類繁榮之大敵故有肺病的人，宜及早治療爲要。肺部旣失去健全，癆病日益增惡，始精神萎頓，盜汗食减，繼而胸痛咳嗽，終於面黃肌瘦，咯痰咯血，耳嗚頭痛，失眠心悸，氣促氣喘，臥難安枕，如僅用治標之劑，雖能遏止表面上之疾狀，而癆菌依然存在，以至繁殖更易，病變更多，惟「補肺拿爾」藥，確有不同之功效，因其能撲滅癆菌，收縮病灶，使已腐蝕之肺空洞，亦可平復如恒。此爲最合理想之肺病內服劑。至於咳嗽一症，服本劑在三小時內，即可鎭咳除痰，萬試萬靈。</p>
<h3>遺精治愈例　幼時遺尿長大后遺精</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>患者唐友謙，年二十歲，（自訴）自小身體羸弱，削瘦多病，常有遺尿之疾，雖小心預備，亦無效，直至十六歲，遺尿方無，而發現遺精，初爲夢遺，後無夢亦遺，而决數漸增，精神不振。（治愈經過），唐君之疾乃由先天羸弱所致，乃令其攝生，常作戶外運動，服「耐而斯遺精片」以鞏固精關。服「補體康」以補衰弱，三月後，遺精已無，身體日漸壯健。</p>
<h3>婚前自凟婚后患早洩</h3>
<p>患者范宏達，年二十五歲，（自訴）十六歲時，因與長余三歲之表兄某同宿一室，致受其引誘，而犯自凟惡習，一年後遺精，但决數甚疏，不料結婚後陰萎無能，房事祇數秒鐘，後嗣關係，特來求治（治愈經過）乃令其服「耐而斯遺精片」以鞏固精關，及投以「袖體康」並每日電療，三月而愈。</p>
<p>淋病瑣言</p>
<h3>患睪丸炎何以容易絶孕</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>人類果何自而來乎？此在進化論者，必曰，人由人猿之進化而來，而實則余謂吾人類所以孳孳不絶者，完全有賴於睪丸製造精子工作之不懈。蓋此種器官之責任，居于首要。而不幸因爲人類時常被病魔所侵襲，以致壞了「人類的發原地」，實是恨事。睪丸最易爲病魔所破者，厥惟淋病。故淋病患者，能於淋毒未侵入睪丸之前，迅速根治，以免防其纒綿難愈之後果。</p>
<p>但是如果淋病患者，一朝真的被淋毒侵入睪丸，亦不必表示悲觀。因爲如果已經侵入睪丸之淋毒，往往先侵入右側睪丸，即成爲副睪丸炎，此時因其淋毒初時侵入，其睪丸內之組織，並未完全被淋毒所破壞如能治療迅速合法，根治並非難事。惟是如果一旦釀成燎原之勢，左右兩側睪丸完全被受此毒，破壞製造精子機能，形成男性絶孕之危險。余用德國抗淋血淸，及淋病特效藥「克淋儂」爲內服劑，一方並用静電療法，使病家絶對安静，如此作安全而徹底療法，使病家絶對安静，如此作安全而徹底療法，在急性睪丸炎，則二天內可以退腫，一星期內斷根，慢性睪丸炎，則三四星期內，亦無不根治。並據余之二十年來診療簿上所統計，凡經余治愈之淋毒性睪丸炎，皆能恢復生殖機能，生兒育女，絶無不良之預後。故世有睪丸炎而即自陷悲觀者，實屬錯誤。診時上午十時至下午六時自即日起每天送診廿號，每號僅取號金五角並贈價值一元之「性病全書」一册</p>

<h3>同鄉</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>某姓人蜂屯蟻聚着的某機關，可以稱之爲「某姓祠堂」，同樣，某地人蛆攢蠅集着的某機關，也就可以稱之爲「其地同鄉會」或「某地會館」。</p>
<p>這種「同鄕會」或「會館」的造成，當然是在上者君干不忘其舊，援引而來的，遠之如泗水亭長的安置豐沛屠沽，近之如狗肉將軍的安挿掖縣剃頭扦脚之流。於是在這「會」裏，若不是皇親國戚，一定是身穿黃馬褂的王公大臣，貝子貝勒。然後再由他們呼朋引類，輾轉援引，形成了淸一色的洋洋大觀。劉安得道，雞犬皆仙，你若身非雞犬，就休想挿足其間：如果你自顧堂堂七尺之軀，要想取雞犬而代之，那就更加動也動不得，其不爲雞啄犬咬者幾希。蓋劉安是牠們的劉安，與你何干！</p>
<p>同姓的結合是宗法社會的中堅，同樣，同鄕的援引是封建制度的遺風。我不忍說宗法社會的不對，更同樣，我又安敢說封建制度的不良。並且博學多聞的先生們，還時常在援今證古，明示封建制度的不可厚非，而同鄕關係的存在是必然的，並且必要的。他們說：</p>
<p>中國人到了外國去，中國人在外國便都是同鄉；將來地球上的人到了火星或仟何行星上去，地球上人在别的行星上便都是同鄉；太陽系內的人到了别的恒星系內去，太陽系內的人在別的恒星系內便都是同鄉；這一個宇宙中人到了别一個宇宙中去，這一個宇宙中人在別一個宇市中便都是同鄕；……那末，縮而小之，逼而緊之，以一機關而論，一認同鄉，便倍覺親熱，而斷定非我族類，其心必異，也就不足爲怪了。</p>
<p>有時我要殺風景的說，旣然在同一個宇宙內都是同鄉，或者就近些說，旣然中國人都是同鄉，有了這樣的大同鄕還不好麽？爲什麼一定還要那儘在螺螄殼內做道塲的小同鄉呢？先生們却說，這楚分工合作，集腋成裘；有了小同鄕，自然容易合成大同鄕；大家組織小同鄉，排斥非同鄉：先王之道，斯爲美！他們一抬出先王來，我只好悶聲勿響，因爲我到底是個現代人，還不懂先王。</p>
<p>不過人心到底是肉做的，想想同鄉會的好處，實在也不可埋沒。例如：同鄉會有丙舍，使你死了不致沒有葬身之地；同鄕會會運柩，使你死了會狐正首邱，魂歸故土；……素來講究死後風光的中國人，還須有賴於同鄕會，方才能够瞑目。那末具體而微的同鄕會」，某機關，安知牠不會於安挿活人之外，更安置死人呢？我們就格外應該在這一點上稱頌牠的功德無量了。</p>
<p>爲了同鄉有這許多好處，所以一般人都喜歡認同鄕。假使同鄕中有個大人物，或任何出名的人，那當然是他們的光榮，允其要逢人稱道。在一國之內，同省就是同鄕，甚至到了較遠之處，鄰省也是同鄕；在一省之內，同府屬或同道屬或同專區就是同鄕；同鄕的起點本來是縣，在必要上一認，就此擴大了。甚至早巳只有同鄕之名而無同鄕之實，還是要同鄉同鄕不去口，蓋同鄕這一個名詞，實在太使人入迷了。</p>
<p>「錢塘蘇小是鄕親」，「鄕親」便是同鄉一，「侯石翁」是那樣的沾沾自喜着。「老鄕親」在天津登臺，博得了多少歡迎。一停船暫相問，或恐是同鄕」；嬌滴滴的聲音，想見其爲人。……</p>
<p>可是你要認同鄕的他，他却偏不認同鄕的你，這事也很多。原因是這個你當然是蹩脚的，這個他當然是得法的；你將有損於他，他當然不認你。漢朝的公孫弘嘆息说：「寗逢惡賓，不逢故人」，便是這個道理。而出賣同鄕以邀功的，也未嘗沒有。據說：從前做御史的，他所弹劾的人，往往是他的親戚故舊，同鄕，因爲只有同鄕的劣跡，他才能够知道得詳細，可以免去風聞的錯誤。……</p>
<p>寫到這裏，却叉使人對於同鄕要不寒而慄了，怎麽辦呢？</p>
<h3>博士：『老頑固，吃大餅吧！』</h3>
<h3>在山㘭裏</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>——徐州突圍回憶記</p>
<p>走過了那片麥地，前面是兩隻光禿禿的石山夾着的一個枒口，在那砑口旁屹立着一座鋪着綠草的高山，——是那末巍峨，險要，只耍對方配備着一挺機關槍在這裹，我們是休想通過這谷道的。但他們却攔阻在公路前面的山頭上，他們以爲我們一定是要沿着那公路走的，不想我們却繞道山這邊來了。</p>
<p>正走在那狹窄的砑口裏時，忽然，一隻飛機從後面追來，大家雖然有些着急，要想趕快散開，可是，在這毫無掩蔽的崎嶇的谷道中，却散也走不開，沒有辦法，就只有大着膽子，沒有管到似的，仍舊散着。</p>
<p>通過了這砑口，坐在一隻山脚旁，在等候着後面的張師長，只見那源源不斷的隊伍像洪水似的，由那砑口裏走了出來，眼睛也望花了。忽然，三隻重轟炸機響着怕人的沉重的聲音飛了來，人馬忙散開伏在路旁和麥田裏，但一部份人馬，却無處可躱，只有在路上蹲着，任那馬在啃着路邊的靑草。</p>
<p>那三隻耀着夕陽的光輝的重轟炸機，悠然的在天空裹兜了一個圈子，飛到那砑口的上空，突然一隻降低了下來：</p>
<p>轟隆！轟隆！</p>
<p>一個火光迸裂起來後，隨着一片稀薄的黑烟冒了起來，飄蕩在天空裏，慢慢的消失了。</p>
<p>山野裏是異常的寂靜，只有那嗡嗡的聲音單調的在響着。</p>
<p>兜了一僩圈子後，那三隻重轟炸機飛到不遠的前方，像打雷似的父響起了一長串爆炸聲：</p>
<p>——轟隆!轟隆!轟隆!……</p>
<p>一隻飛機向後飛過來，突然降低了下來，半翹着翅膀，向麥田裏掃射着:</p>
<p>——噠噠噠噠噠……</p>
<p>隨着特務連的弟兄，我們整齊的躺在山脚下，眼睜睜的望着那三隻飛機，帶着驕傲和恥辱，瘋在的在天空裏巡行着，心裏充滿了極度的憤怒！</p>
<p>太陽藩落下山去了，天空裹陰沉沈的，夜色爬到了原野的遠方，顯得有些灰漠漠的時候，那三隻飛機才揚飛去了。</p>
<p>伏在路旁和麥田裏休息够了的弟兄們，爬了起來，臉上浮着歡笑：</p>
<p>「你媽的，天天來轟炸，也不見把老子炸死掉！」</p>
<p>「他們這些大騙子，今天轟炸回去，不知又要如何的向他們的老百姓宣傳着：我們今天被他們炸死了多少了！」</p>
<p>「他們的老百姓眞是可憐！自己的血汗錢只是被他們的軍閥騙了買一些炸彈，來丟在我們的土地上，還天大受着他們的那欺騙的宜傳，眞是寃枉！」</p>
<p>踏着蒼茫的暮靄，沿着一條高低不平的土路，隊伍又向前出發了。</p>
<h3>細菌及麻醉劑戰爭（下）</h3>
<p>— J.M.Murray著　天任譯</p>
<p>「大戰爆發時，百萬戰士集於前線，忽然敵方礮火，向他們猛烈轟擊。落在他們中閒的礮彈可有點異樣，都炸裂而成粉碎的塵土。陣陣「彈塵」降到戰士身上，立刻整千整萬的倒臥地上，失去知覺，轉瞬之間，百萬雄師都麻醉而倒地。於是大礮停止轟擊，跟着就有大批敵人，如潮地湧來。百萬失了知覺的人，被解除了武裝，並被敵人團團圍住，在要緊的據點上，還安置着許多機關鎗。不久，他們才漸漸蘇醒。當他們恢復意識時，四面八方安置好的揚聲器，就告訴他們，若不投降，就會被殲滅，他們自然是覺得犧牲無益，而無條件的投降了。戰事也就如此一結束。」</p>
<p>（四）蕭伯納寧取麻醉劑或毒氣戰爭</p>
<p>英國大文豪蕭伯納，在他最近評論戰爭武器的文中，曾宣稱：他寧願被麻醉而失去知覺，或竟中毒氣而窒死，而不願被十六吋口徑的大礮轟成碎片。</p>
<p>一九三七年十一月四日，三個紐的化學家，向美國化學協會報吿，在下决戰爭中，百萬人如何可能被麻醉。他們說，礮彈中所能裝的麻醉品是一種氯化乙醯，（Acetylchlorine）再混合一種能蝕傷表皮的刺激物，因此麻醉劑能侵入血管，使血壓降低而失知覺。變更藥物的比例，可以使有効時間自數分鐘至數小時之久。</p>
<p>許多人將認爲，以麻醉劑用於下决大戰中並不覺其恐怖性，但是除此還有許多令人憎惡的麻醉藥，戰事領袖中或有獸性大發而使用牠們去毒害敵人的。</p>
<p>（五）蘇俄趕製戰時麻醉劑</p>
<p>蘇俄領袖人物曾公曾公開宣言，他們如被迫而與人作戰，彼等將在最短期閒殲滅敵人。以前德意志共和國的專家們，曾替俄國在各地設立偉大的化學工廠。俄國政黨領袖也從不掩飾，他們的化學工廠是在日夜製造供戰爭用的麻醉藥和毒氣，以便迅速地消滅進攻他們的敵人。德國的化學工塲也極力製造麻醉劑和毒氣，以供下次大戰之用。英國的化學家們，在一年前曾警吿世界說，他們也許會在下决大戰中，被迫而拿出以毒攻毒的手段。</p>
<p>俘虜的反抗行爲及常常企圖逃遁，是令人討厭的。在世界大戰時，會有人建議，强迫俘虜吸食鴉片，以便省除麻煩，幸而未切實採用。但在下决大戰時，或者會採用的。或者竟有狠心的國家會用一種「催眠丸」給他們的俘虜受用。由於一種惡性麻藥的影響，能使得俘虜酷嗜殘殺，同時神智昏迷，不能分淸敵友，而被遺回本國去殺害自己的伙伴。</p>
<p>（六）人道的戰爭（？）</p>
<p>科學專家們想利用麻醉劑毒氣作戰爭武器，以赦其製造殺人的武器的責任，因而著文論辯說，以麻藥毒氣爲武器較之以砲火炸碎人體爲八道些，慈悲些。並說如以使敵人屈服爲最後目的，則儘可出諸較爲人道的方法，卽以麻醉劑使敵人失去意識。他們指陳至少有十幾種麻醉劑可使人情冷淡，不願做任何事情，也討厭任何事體，唯一的切望只是「和平」。</p>
<p>試想，如在戰時整國的人民都受了這棟麻醉，那末重要的工業都會停頓，軍火廠連一個小零件，也造不出來，自然會戰敗了。</p>
<p>好幾個著名的專家都曾宣稱，在戰時下麻藥於敵國飲用水源是輕而易舉的事。要在食物中下麻藥是較爲困難，而水源是很容易投下麻藥的。</p>
<p>這樣麻醉敵人的方法，卽使大規模的使用，也不易被察覺。因爲沒有顯著的徵兆，沒有毒害，沒有死亡，只不過增加國家觀念的冷淡。人民將不問戰事的勝負屬誰，只希望快點太平，什麼條件都不管。</p>
<p>現在來說麻醉藥將會是世界戰爭的決勝因素，似乎是夢囈，但我們要記得，近代戰爭武器如飛機，潛艇，坦克等，以前也以爲是人們的夢幻哩！（譯自世界雜誌）</p>
<h3>一條眞理</h3>
<p>— 士的</p>
<p>假如世上本來沒有眞理，我應該替牠加上這一條；假如已經有了許多眞理，我祇相信這一條：「意志是人類的第一生命。」</p>
<p>要不是自己的心裹早立下這條信仰，也許在兩年前會爲那一樁挫敗而自殺；倘若沒有這句話的鼓勵，我耍驚詫地詢問自己：爲甚麼近幾年來從不曾因一件失意的事而淌過一滴淚？</p>
<p>目前，無數的人毀了家，可是他們不向誰訴一聲苦。他們感到，應付艱苦的時代，堅忍的鬥志比獲得別人的同情更可珍貴。</p>
<p>朋友！倘若你相信這是一條眞理，你該一直相信下去。如果你還不知道，那末請仔細想一遍。（義賣獻金）</p>

<h3>談「農夫曲」</h3>
<p>— 思華</p>
<p>蘇聯鳥克蘭影片工廠出品　滬光大戲院今天日夜開映</p>
<p>早年在「蘇聯聞見録一里讀到掰慈納和十月革命公社的集體農場農民，在過着怎樣共同耕棲，共同畜牧共同生產和消費的生活時，我覺得很驚奇，羨慕。但這不是憑空揑造的神話，而是鐵一般的事實。書本上所紀述的蘇聯集體農塲，在農夫曲里活生生的湧現在我們眼前了。當我們看見銀慕上的豐滿的農產，機械化的收割時，心里的羨慕又汹湧起來。蘇聯的集體農塲是在飛快地進步着的，一九三〇年的十月革命公社還剛買了一架汽犁，開始應用化學肥料，而「農夫曲」里的集體農塲非但有甚多的汽犁，而且已有很好的收獲了。</p>
<p>「農夫曲」的主題雖然是在鼓勵生產，但對於抗戰中的中國是有着很好的影響的。</p>
<p>第一：中國的抗戰是長期的，除了軍事政治等外，積極發動後方的生產工作，是支持長期抗戰的一個重大的條件。中國的生產事業大部份是農業，如何改進農業便成爲目前很迫切需要硏究的課題·自然，中國要立刻建立起集體農塲一時還不可能，但依照中國情形部份地接受集體農塲的優點是可以的。至少，集體農塲制度的建立，於國防上是有着極大帮助，因爲集體農塲的農民已經有組織，受過政治訓練，懂得團結的力量，而且那些汽犁，也隨時的可以改爲武器：它不但充實抗戰的資源，還能使侵略者進犯到集體農塲里如陷入重圍。也許有人憂慮道是不容易實現的，然而蘇聯的搿慈納農塲和十月革命公社何嘗不是在艱難刻苦中成長起來的呢。</p>
<p>第二：它吿訴我們戀愛和工作並不是敵對的。蘇聯並不單單看重工作而沒有戀愛的；不過，它吿訴我們必需在不妨害工作之下去談戀愛。「農夫曲的農民瘋在戀愛畢竟被工作隊隊長的正確理論所說服了。這一點，我以爲在孤島上可以起一點敎育作用，囚爲火錢的遠雖孤島，許多人都沉迷在色情的享樂中，甚至於掉棄自己的工作，陷自己於死滅。這一種錯誤，「農夫曲」是糾正過來了。關於這一點，我尢其佩服編劇者波密斯起可夫的鼓動手段　强烈，他描寫的戀愛糾紛，並不像好萊塢的劇作家那樣的製造一段「香艷滑稽一的故事；相反的，他從戀愛糾紛中煽惑雙方面加緊工作。</p>
<p>波密斯起可夫的藝術手腕的高强，是可以從這一個簡單的故事描寫得那樣生動中看得出來的。這里面有說敎，但，我們看不出它的說敎的影子。他運用了一些喜劇的手法，把更夫和記賬員誇張一點，蘇聯的喜劇手法和好萊塢有點不同的，它在誇張中不忘記現實和寫實。</p>
<p>有人說，蘇聯電影差不多都楚粗技大葉的，而「農夫曲」的導演却顯得非常細膩，如：</p>
<p>（一）記賬員整理文件，文件忽然被風吹去，鏡頭刻到門邊，瑪琳卡挨鬥進來。</p>
<p>（二）用很靈活的鏡頭，描寫樹林中對對情侶，有二點更値得注：（甲）鏡頭從橋上的情侶身上搖落，鏡　在河面劃過，搖上，又一對的情侶在樹下河畔歌唱。（乙）利用昔響與空間，歌唱在森林空閒盪漾，鏡頭在空間隨意移動。</p>
<p>（三）在最後的瑪琳卡和史格拉鬧蹩投，各人在自己家里唱歌，導演者利用音響疊接，是非常聰明的。</p>
<p>最有力的塲面是在史格拉說了瑪琳卡壊話以後，農女隊便加緊工作，這時候，導演用了高速度的改換鏡頭，寫她們高喊，唱歌，堆農作物，這里的剪接是　別敏捷的。、是的，中間的大風雨前後的聲面上的時間與空閒還不够一致，顯明一點說，是近景和全景還不能十二分配合，如：</p>
<p>（一）近景：天上的雲漸黑；用風吹把草在鏡頭前吹過去；堆起來的農作物被吹倒：農女們搶堆……</p>
<p>（二）遠景：天空很光亮，不像是雨天，僅在鏡頭前淋水下來作爲雨，然而這雨不能和空間合調。</p>
<p>這自然是小節。而且多半還是藝術上的問題。導演對於整個的處理，却始終是在雄壯，活潑的氣氛下完成的。</p>
<p>我相當喜歡演記賬員的劉別士歸夫，據說他還是第一次拍戲，然而他的演技頗能使這人物典型化，他的動作是誇大的，相當丑角的地的，然而，他很能理解這一人物，歪曲一點，道人物會變成破壊集體農塲的壊蛋，實際上，他却祗是在自私一，去挑撥別人的情感。他的戲最優處是：（一）拉史格拉進來剃頭。（二）瑪卡琳在隊長調査記賬員成績單時，故意在旁竊聽，他顯出一副尷尬相。（三）他被更夫追逐時的狼狽，和得獎時的喜悅。</p>
<p>頭里興的更夫演得相當誠實可愛，他在森林中趕情侶們回家時的表情，是十分有趣的。追逐記賬員，雖帶有一點笑劇的色彩，却也流露了純厚的正義感的。</p>
<p>別士根的汽犁駕駛員，很能表現蘇聯靑年的壯健，刻苦</p>
<p>拉德尼娜的瑪卡琳很活潑，受駡時的哭泣，頗有眞摯的情感。</p>
<p>其他演員也是很成功的。</p>
<p>至於音樂和歌唱，我祇能說出很喜愛而已。</p>
<h3>留心藥水郵票</h3>
<p>— 筠</p>
<p>「銅元到那裏去了？」</p>
<p>電車上，小菜塲上，街頭巷尾，整個上海，幾乎都能聽到這樣的問句。其實這些問的人，何嘗不知道銅元那裏去了呢，那末，他們在假裝痴呆嗎？絕對不是！因爲上電車，買東西，爲了銅元的缺少，發生了種種麻煩，但又無法制裁那些喪心病在的奸商，「銅元到那裹去了？」這問句裏面正蘊蓄着無限的憤怒哩。</p>
<p>確實如此，爲了零錢，市塲上發生了紛亂，有些商店甚至犧牲營業。但是日用的必需品又怎樣呢？譬如醬園，烟兌店，這些商店都是和住民有密切的關係的，而這密切的關係又都是零錢的交易，於是大家想出了一種通融的辦法：有的發本號代價券，有的以郵票作找頭。</p>
<p>雖然明知道這樣辦法也是非常不便利，本號代價券祇　本號通用，郵票容易沾汚，並且背面的膠質溶化之後，容易和其他的東西黏起來，輾轉相授，馬上會　成一張廢紙。可是郵票一通用以後，倒底比代價券便利，爲了避免損失計，都把透明紙包起來，大家像輔幣券一樣地在流通着。</p>
<p>可是連這一點小便利也引起了一般「不肖之徒」的注意，這兩天市上已經發現不少用過的郵票了。他們把舊郵票在一種藥水裏洗過，面上印章比較糢糊，再包上透明紙，簡直不辦眞僞了。而且相授的人都作爲一種輔幣的代替品，沒有人注意到郵票的本質，可是等到眞要作爲寄信用的時候，才發現裏面包的是藥水洗過的郵票。</p>
<p>這雖然是小騙局，但乘着這個機會來「混水裏摸魚」，他們的爲害比收買銅元的奸商不會輕呢。</p>
<p>希望大家注意這批搗亂市面的不肖之徒！</p>
<h3>談收集舊郵票</h3>
<p>— 沙璐明</p>
<p>有的入歡喜收集舊銅板，各式各樣老的，古的奇怪的，外國的銅板都像當他寳貨似地收集起來，旁人人看來雖然覺得他有些奇突；其實這倒也是一、種「好癖」，比浪費金錢的消遣法不知好得多少倍了。</p>
<p>另外像收藏古書啊，古瓶啊，古器啊……都不算怎樣壊的習慣。</p>
<p>現在來談談收集舊郵票的趣事：不要說外國郵票，就是中國郵票要收齊也是件很困難的事，非隨時隨地留心不可。譬如前淸的郵票，就分了好幾種，郵戳上的日期也很有趣，是依陰曆算的。遠僻的省份還加上「限某省貼用」的字樣，這是很難以收集的，近的如四川，雲南等還可以，更遠的像新疆等太難集了，還有像一國民政府統一紀念郵票」，「孫總理國葬紀念郵票」「譚延闓院長紀念郵票」等發行的臨時性質的，要收集者留心的，否則很小易收集到，因爲這種臨時性質的紀念邼票的發行額是非常少的，常然容易被捷　先登的人買光。</p>
<p>有一種是大淸國郵票一上加印「中華民國」四個紅字的郵票，這類也是寳貴的。「新生活運動紀念郵票」和「中華郵政開辦四十週年紀念郵票」，不但在形色上不同，而且這不同正代表時代的變遷呢。此外像紀念革命先烈黄興，陳英士，宋敎仁等的郵票，看來好像很容易收齊，但是要把一套都集起來那就難了。</p>
<p>有好幾種郵票是作廢不用了，但在作廢之前，郵政局總是有通吿的。現在把通行的郵票種類抄錄在下：普通郵票——印有總理遺像者計有二分，五分，一角五分，二角五分，一元，二元，五元。印有鄧先烈鏗遺像者計有半分，一分半。印有陳先烈英士遺像者計有一分，五角。印有廖先烈仲凱遺像者計有三分，三角。印有朱烈士執信遺像者計有八分，一角三分。印有宋烈士敎仁遺像者計有一角，一角七分。印有黄烈士克强遺像者計有二角，四角。至於航空郵票有一角五分，二角五分，三角，四角五分，五角，六角，九角，一元等八種，一律印有飛機及長城圖。</p>
<p>上面的一些郵票還不過是現在通行的，巳可見得數目之多，所以要把中國郵票集齊眞是件不容易的事，何况還有過去已作廢了的郵票呢。</p>
<p>美國郵票發行得也很多，同時五顏六色也最美觀，淸晰，非常悅目。印有林肯像，胡佛像，華盛頓像，羅期福像等等。德國郵票印刷得很精美，能反光彩。而英國郵票都大多是千篇一律一個皇帝的頭像。古巴和墨西哥的郵票也很美觀，而且是人像。至於捷克斯拉伐克郵票的圖案也很精緻，丹麥郵票，意大利郵票却又別具一格了。</p>
<p>總之集郵也是一種專門藝術，也是一種「好癖」：要訣是在於要隨時隨地留心各種舊郵票和注意郵局裏新郵票的發行。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　綠窗談愛重締良緣</p>
<p>潘佩美那時眞有說不出的悲痛，不過那種殉身的事，凡是通達的女人，是不做的。惟有一心見趙樂天復仇，也不會失志去嫁了別人。她父親要把她如何如何，她也不能答應的。誰知趙棄天受傷進了醫院後，不到兩年，潘佩英的父親，被人暗算身死了。原來那時　，潘佩英的父親，漸漸的闊起來了。他娶了一位海上紅舞女，名字喚做凌霄花的做姨太太。不想這位凌霄花，雖然身爲舞女，却是愛國份子。她本來是個小家碧玉，也可以粗謀溫飽，在戰爭的當兒，她的家鄕淪陷了。她的母親，她的姊姊，都爲人所姦汚，她那時還小，幸虧逃避在墳由窠裏，沒有被魔手所攫取，到了她年紀漸漸大了，這個恥辱與寃仇，常是咬噬着她的心，沒有一刻忘懐。因爲一切田廬房屋都沒有了，轉　　徙，後來做了一個舞女。可是她雖然心懐冰霜，却是面如桃李，因此不到幾月，便大紅而特紅了。那時有一　愛國份子，組織了一個秘密結社，名曰什麽團。那個團裏的人物，有男有女。男的是工人也有，小販也有，高貴的職員也有，卑微的僕伐也有。女的是妓女也有，舞女也有，大家閨秀也有，工廠女工也有。不過這些人物，都是一班靑年，年紀大的人是沒有的。凌霄花也是其中之一，爲的是她的母親姊姊，都被姦汚喪命，她一心要想復仇。有一天，有位舞客，帶了她去看戲。那天的戲，正做明末遺恨一，她看到最後的費宮人剌虎一塲，不自禁地將手在自己膝蓋上很命的一拍。倒把陪她同去看戲的那位舞客一嚇，說道：『你做什麽呀？嚇人一跳？凌霄化也　得自己忘形骸了，連忙笑着說道：『沒有什麽！我瞧她演得眞好。爲了報仇，就顧不得什麽了」。因爲她一向把仇恨藏在心裏，就是熟客面前，也不曾說起她的母姊的事。也是潘佩英的父親惡貫滿盈的日子到了，偏偏去看中了她。在起初很有許多人，拜倒在她的舞衫之上的，要想娶她，她都不願意，而一槪拒絕了。現在聽說她倒願意嫁藩老老，大家有此詫異，幷且選有她的熟舞客，不免對她惋惜的呢。（一三六）</p>

<h3>復旦劇運的復活</h3>
<p>— 憬然</p>
<p>—兩團體聯合公演收入救難</p>
<p>過去，在洪深敎授領導下的「復旦劇社」，不容否認，在上海—甚至可說是整個中國的藝壇上，佔有重要的地位，光芒萬丈，眾口交譽。後來，洪氏脫離復旦南走百粵，「復旦劇社」因主持之人，遂吿停頓！</p>
<p>最近，復旦大學一部分同學所組織的「海燕文藝社」和「女同學會」兩團體，想把已將沒落的復旦劇運挽救過來；經過了三個多月的籌備，乃得於十二日（星期一）下午七時半，借座寗波同鄕會作為救助難胞的小規模的聯合公演。—這是復旦劇運復興的第一聲！</p>
<p>這次，上演的一共有三齣短幕劇：</p>
<p>（一）高樓上—這是一個現實的喜劇，是針對着上海極嚴重的住的問題而發的。但在演出上似乎發揮得不够，對於趁火打刦的二房東壓迫三房客的罪惡，沒有充分的暴露出來，使觀眾感覺那位二房東太太並不怎樣的辣手連帶的由於房東太太的一大篇關於加租的「訴苦」，又反使觀眾覺得「情有可原」。和現實相較，不能不承認全劇鬆懈，失敗。</p>
<p>（二）討厭的東西—敘述一個裝腔作勢的的女性，和一個懦弱男子的醜態，表現上流社會中的醜惡。在演出上：女廨密黎生夫人的對白，聲浪欠高，以致於使後排的觀眾有「看無言的啞劇」之感。富有阿Q　性的男主角演來很為努力，但未免過火。</p>
<p>（三）舞女淚—這一幕要算是最精彩，最能吸引觀眾的戲了。故事是叙述一個舞女曼麗受着舞客小陳的引誘，以致失身。並為顧全小陳的名譽而打胎，因之病了。她還夢想小陳能和她結婚，然而，所得的回覆是：「少爺有的是錢，化上幾個，那兒沒有女人玩！」無情的打擊，使她瘋狂了。這一幕由於導演處理的得當，配合上演員的努力，使劇情益顯緊張，而緊緊地抓住觀眾的心，無疑地成功！這裏有着可喜的！</p>
<p>這一次兩團體的聯合公演關於佈景和道具，為了檯種關係，不免簡陋。而演員又因經騐的不够，所以無論動作對白都不免有些眞正在「做戲」。但演員中如：白莎，魯魯，維拉，甘草，梅波等都不失為可造的戲劇人才。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>黃金聆歌記</h3>
<p>— 吠聲</p>
<p>富運成科班大規模來滬演出，此為第二次，筆者於星期日夜塲至黃金聆歌，入座時，則閻世善之朝金項已成尾聲，繼為全本盜御馬，此劇近年在南方滇全者絕少，良以無好武丑耳。是晚　盛戎飾養敦，聲容並茂，自始至終，絲毫不茍，博得觀眾極度好評，當此凈行凋零聲中，洵屬難能可貴，不易多得之上駟材。高盛麟飾黃天霸，頗具小樓風度，唱，念，作無一處不力宗楊氏，殊可喜也。艾世菊之朱光祖，念白旣流利，武工亦純熟，尤為是劇生色，休息後，為全本鳥龍院，毛世來之閻惜姣，　綵登塲，頗守花旦典型；貫盛習之宋江，亦能稱職，於猜惜姣心事之平板中，第三句下句之過門，操琴者誤起作上句之過門，貫伶斯時頻回顧塲面，奈已拉出，不復能改，幸貫伶頗能鎭靜，唱「莫不是媽兒娘打罵不成？」句，仍以下句唱出，殊為不易。惟世來於宋江進門時，未作關門一點，似覺不無小疵。蓋後來推宋江出門時，曾有拔閂開門之動作也。倘此時須拔閂開門，則前時應關門，倘前不關門，則此時正無需拔閂開門也，此為多數伶人演此劇之通病，不僅毛伶為然也。沙世鑫於劉　下書起連演坐樓殺媳，火冒抖亂，無一足取，懸牌在盛麟盛戎之上，殊為裘高二伶興不平之感，活捉出塲，世來在錄光燈下之圓塲，走　頗為　理，惜時已十一時半，乃不及　塲而返。（義賣獻金）</p>

<h3>談談潮州戲</h3>
<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>潮州戲在前幾年的時候，也曾有過二三班，在上海演出，像大中華恩派亞，都有過它的足跡，然時間極暫，祇數月而已；因為潮州旅潮同鄕為數不多，而滬地人士，大都不讀潮語，去觀賞的很少，以致不能久演也，甞憶潮劇之來滬最早　則在十幾年關，其演出地點，在汕頭路笑舞臺。</p>
<p>現在，潮劇在皇后演出，是老三正順香班子，在汕頭確是很有聲望的。在數年前假大中華演出的時候，筆者也甞去觀賞過好幾次，筆者歷非潮人，却和潮人厮混有年，覺該班演出，頭面裝扮，皆勝過其他潮劇班，無陳腐俗氣，其時正排着岳武穆，演來十分懇切，體貼，脚色十分整齊，現在前度劉郎，重來滬地，必將抽暇去欣賞一次，不知它現在的藝術，進步到如何的程度了呢？不過該班所定的座價，太貴了些，不能平民化，因此所以不能普遍潮劇的觀眾吧？記得該班在數年前大中華演出，座價八角，六角，四角而已。</p>
<p>講到潮劇的音樂，與廣東戲略似，而其八間則幽靜無比，勝粵劇多多，更迴異於京粵兩劇，板眼奏來，悠揚之處，引人入勝，至其脚色，小生花旦，皆為十歲至十六七歲的兒童，蓋取其嗓子脆爽也。若一到了發育時期，嗓子轉變，即不能起小生花旦，而即淪為老生小丑之流。　其為此類脚色，時期不過數年，靠其天然的嗓子而已，非若京劇的嗓子，經長時間的訓練能持久至於終身不渝，故潮劇的在此塲合頗異於其他戲劇也。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>孫毓堃侯喜瑞墮落下去可可惜了</p>
<p>在楊（小樓）俞（振廷）逝去，尚老（和玉０歸隱的今日，新平武生行裏能兼俞楊兩派之長，而且有嗓子有身個的全材武生，的確要推孫毓堃為首選了。毓堃一名小振廷，現年四十餘歲，他學的是小樓振廷二人的菁華，旣無楊氏晚年之瘟，又無小毛包肚年之火，尤其是像「艷陽樓」「鐵龍山」「金錢豹」「覇王別姬」這類勾臉戲，要是猛一出台預先不說明他是孫毓堃，單　他的亮相台步起塌等等，到眞可魚目混珠，冒充俞楊一下，况且他天生成的瘦長臉，也效法小樓　盔出戴得特別靠後，勾臉時的面楨佔得略外大，腦門一部，幾佔全面三分之一强，這樣就顯着更有氣派，所以小樓飾覇王，才出來就很有「力拔山兮所蓋世」的氣槪。周一腿（瑞安）身個原也不矮，但是行定一瞧，就譏他為小覇王，反倒不如孫毓堃登樣，這就見出二人學楊的得覈與不得了。</p>
<p>學楊最早的二人，就是孫·周·李（萬春），周是一條腿不很得勁，並且太笨太火，每拉一個身段，簡直咬牙放屁努足十二分的氣力，萬春身量小，短打戲還可以，長靠戲就結顯着氣派小了，同時他的毛病，也是兩腿沒根，彷彿像抬不起來似的，唱武生全憑腰腿上見工夫，周·李兩人要是腿上工夫欠缺，先已失去武生應有的條件，緃令捧的人再多，但也終於不能成為第一流名武生的，尚老（和玉）雖是嗓音扮相，都比不上小樓，然而就單靠腿上的工夫，還走了許多年的老運，隨便在台上一站，儼然就是一根釘釘在那裏，脚腿上一有根，當然不論擺出個什麽架子來，也就顯着老鍊好看了。孫毓堃的身上腿上部都比周李兩人邊式有勁，就是唸幾句也很有口勁，學小樓有幾分相像。十年前他在北平出演，曾負過盛名，後來他因同學翠打得火熱，兩人太密切了，同時染了黑白兩種嗜好，因此身體漸漸虧損，對於演戲就存了敷衍主義，近許多年來，幾至無人問津，不但外埠都想不到邀他，就是在故都各園子裏，也不甚有人請敎他了。—（三六）—</p>

<p>風流小生孫敏，春初從昆明歸來，即經新華公司爭先聘定，簽下了長期合同。他是向來富於求知慾的一個好靑年。最近，他為鑒於美容醫師這事業，正見相當發達，對此極感興趣，諸如改造眼皮，陷眶，以及高鼻術與除疲，去痣等一切人工美容醫術，一般布　喬亞的摩登士女，旣自有其需要，而在於化妝術方面，亦復頗多裨益。上月間因特倩人介紹，去和上海美容醫院宋子賓醫師開始洽談，表白這樣投師問業的意念。據宋醫師說：這美容醫，除了書本工夫之外，還得多重實際經騐，所以應得常到那裏去臨診實習才好。並言：彼此不妨就以朋友地位，大家研究研究，不必定什麽師生的名分。這當然是他的謙詞了。孫敏事後考慮結果，因為每天在拍戲之餘前去練習，自己本職上好得絕無妨碍；剛經幾度續商之後，隨於前天歡然確定。同時，孫敏並定十五日設宴口央茶社，舉行拜師典禮了。</p>

<h3>Extremely Rapid Advance of the Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi; Superior Situation Near Zhongtiao Mountain; One-Third of Japanese Forces Eliminated, Large Numbers of Wounded Soldiers Transported North; Japanese Troops Invading Mengyin and Yishui Under Chinese Control</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shaanxi Telegram: In the battle where the Chinese army captured Pinglu and Maojindu, the Japanese suffered nearly 1,500 casualties. The Chinese army is now advancing extremely rapidly, with Chinese forces attacking everywhere along the southern section of the Tongpu Railway. The battle situation near Zhongtiao Mountain has greatly improved. The Japanese are resisting stubbornly in Lishi and Liulin, but the Chinese army is still fiercely attacking. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing Telegram: The Japanese army launched a multi-pronged invasion of southeastern Shandong Province. The Chinese army is now engaging in mobile guerrilla warfare, intercepting the Japanese forces everywhere. In recent days, nearly 2,000 Japanese soldiers have been annihilated near Mengyin, Yishui, and Linyi. A certain Chinese commander and others are personally directing operations on the front lines, greatly boosting morale. The Japanese troops invading Mengyin and Yishui are now under Chinese control. As of the 12th, the battles on all fronts were still fierce. (Special Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, as a result of continuous counterattacks by the Chinese army in southern Shanxi over the past three days, Maojindu and Pinglu have been completely recovered. On the western Shanxi front, Liulin and Mucun have also been recaptured. At the same time, the Japanese troops at Jun Ferry, an important Yellow River crossing, have also been cleared by the Chinese army, and ferry services on the Yellow River have resumed. After being defeated by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops in the Zhongtiao Mountain area left behind over 10,000 corpses. The main force of the Japanese army in that area has now retreated north towards Changdian. It is estimated that the Japanese military strength in this area is no more than 30,000 men, including the 20th Division, part of the 27th Division, and two artillery regiments. However, the losses suffered by the Japanese side this time have reached one-third of their forces in this area. The Zhengtai Railway is now being used entirely to transport Japanese wounded soldiers back to the north, and ordinary commercial traffic has been completely cut off, which shows the intensity of the fighting in Shanxi Province. According to a Chinese military spokesman, the reason why the Japanese troops at Jun Ferry could not hold their ground was that the main communication line between Lishi and Liulin was cut off by the Chinese army, and supplies of ammunition and reinforcements could not be delivered, forcing them to abandon the territory they had gained. In short, the main reason for the Japanese failure was that they could not maintain their rear lines of communication while advancing. The victory of the Chinese army in Shanxi Province this time can also serve as clear evidence that the guerrillas have pinned down the Japanese army, and the Japanese army no longer has the ability to advance. According to a Chinese spokesman, judging from the various Japanese documents obtained on the battlefield, at present, one out of every two soldiers fighting in China is an untrained recruit. This is because the Japanese have lost 800,000 soldiers in the war against China so far, which is the reason why the Japanese military strength is gradually weakening. (Associated Press Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) When the Chinese army passed north through Pinglu, they encountered five or six hundred Japanese soldiers near Dongcun and Checun. After a courageous assault, they killed over 300 Japanese, including the Japanese company commanders Yoshii and Murata, and captured four Japanese mountain guns, one mortar, three machine guns, and a large number of rifles and military supplies. (Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) A certain Chinese unit in southern Shandong launched a fierce attack on Ge Gou Town (north of Linyi) on the 9th. The Japanese, who were entrenched in the town, resisted stubbornly. After a courageous assault by the Chinese army, the Japanese could not hold out and fled towards Tangtou. Ge Gou Town was immediately recovered. The Japanese troops who retreated from Qingqisi were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. They are now fleeing towards Douba. Zhu Mo has been recovered by the Chinese army. (Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Tianjin Issues Announcement</p>
<h3>Announces Implementation of Traffic Restrictions in Concessions Starting at Six O'Clock This Morning; Japanese Authorities in Tianjin and Beiping Secretly Discuss Isolation Measures; U.S. Nationals Still Allowed to Import Food, Medical Supplies, and Utensils; British Side Declares It Will Take Necessary Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Announcement Issued by Japanese Military in Tianjin</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The Japanese military and consular authorities held an emergency meeting on the night of the 10th. Takeuchi, the head of the Economic Affairs Section of the Asia Development Board, came to Tianjin from Beiping to attend the meeting. It did not end until the morning of the 11th. They made some decisions on countermeasures regarding the financial aspect after the blockade of the concessions. A spokesman for the Japanese military and the Japanese consul announced on the 12th that the blockade of the concessions would begin from that day or the 13th. All foreign commercial organizations with warehouses in the city were given until the 12th to move their inventory into the concessions, otherwise the Japanese side would not be responsible for any incidents that might occur. The U.S. Consul in Tianjin was also notified that all 450 U.S. nationals in Tianjin would still be allowed to import a considerable amount of food after the blockade, and that their supplies might even be provided by the Japanese side. The Japanese side claimed that this action was solely to deal with Britain and France. It was also stated that special passes would be issued to foreign journalists. It is reported that after learning of the above news, the British Consul-General told foreign reporters that if the Japanese blockade exceeded seven weeks, the British side would take necessary countermeasures. Furthermore, there have been no diplomatic negotiations between the Japanese and the British and French concessions here since the 12th. News has also come from Tokyo confirming that the blockade will be implemented on the 14th, so mediation efforts have been suspended. (Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to sources on the foreign side in Tianjin, a spokesman for the Japanese Army in Tianjin declared to the press on the 12th that the Japanese Army authorities had decided to deal with the British concession in an independent manner, and that the nature of this approach was extremely serious. According to various Japanese newspapers in Tianjin, the main points of the economic blockade of the British concession were as follows: (1) Prohibiting ships from sailing to the British concession. (2) All foreign nationals entering and leaving the British concession will be inspected and their passports checked, but Britons will not be allowed to enter or leave. The French concession remains tranquil as usual, and the authorities do not appear to have taken any special measures. (Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Although the Japanese have implemented preliminary measures to blockade the British and French concessions today, the British community here is responding to the increasingly serious situation with a firm resolve and without any sign of panic. The commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin issued a proclamation this afternoon, prohibiting pedestrians and vehicles from passing between the Japanese concession and the Chinese area, and between the British and French concessions, starting at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow. It is claimed that this measure is being taken to curb anti-Japanese and communist activities. The blockade of Wan Guo (International) Bridge will be in effect from 6:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight. Yamaguchi Street, Asahi Street, Biroon Street, Taiyo Street, Zhong Street, and Race Course Road will be closed from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. The proclamation also states that all pedestrians and vehicles will be searched by the Japanese authorities at seven designated locations. All ships sailing on the Bai River must dock at the Dalian Wharf near the newly built Japanese Bridge to await inspection. Violators of this proclamation will be punished according to the penalties prescribed by the Japanese Garrison Commander. According to a spokesman for the Japanese military authorities today, the blockade of the British and French concessions is the minimum necessary measure for the Japanese army to fulfill its responsibilities in the current environment. This action was triggered by the British refusal to extradite four suspects, but this is only one aspect of the matter. The Japanese proclamation this time expresses the anger of the Japanese government and public towards the British policy of "pro-Chiang." Now that the arrow has left the bowstring, the issue can no longer be resolved simply by extraditing the four suspects. If the British concession authorities do not quickly change their policy and abandon their "pro-Chiang" stance, such as protecting anti-Japanese and communist elements, sacrificing Joint Reserve Bank notes to support Chinese legal tender, monopolizing goods, condoning illegal elements' use of wireless radios, and allowing the use of anti-Japanese textbooks, and do not cooperate with Japan's efforts to build a new order in East Asia, the Japanese army will never reconcile with them. The spokesman expressed regret that the Chinese, German, American, and other foreign people in the British and French concessions would feel inconvenienced by the blockade of the concessions, and advised the residents of the above countries to withdraw from the British and French concessions. In the British concession, apart from occasional patrols by light military trucks carrying Durham Light Infantry troops along the concession boundary in recent days, it is reported that further precautions have been taken, but their nature has not yet been determined. The food situation has been investigated, and it is reported that there is an ample supply of flour. According to Japanese sources, there are currently no Japanese nationals or Japanese businesses in the British and French concessions. Branches of the Yokohama Specie Bank, Mitsui &amp; Co., and the Joint Reserve Bank have all withdrawn on Sunday. The news also said that foreign residents in the British and French concessions are feeling uneasy. After the blockade is implemented tomorrow, 350,000 Chinese residents and foreigners of various nationalities will be trapped in the two concessions. Foreigners are trying to keep their Chinese servants within the concessions, but many have resigned and left. Prices in the British and French concessions have risen by 20 percent.

<p>(Tianjin) When the Japanese military authorities received reporters this afternoon, they issued a lengthy announcement declaring that traffic restrictions would be implemented in the British and French concessions and the areas of the Kun Shu (Italian concession) starting at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow, but the exact nature of these restrictions has not yet been disclosed. The announcement stated briefly that "patience has its limits. Now we have endured what can be endured. For the sake of maintaining peace and order in North China and for self-defense, we have decided to take necessary measures." It cited the killing of three Japanese soldiers in Tianjin by Chinese terrorists in March and April, and the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the new customs superintendent and former manager of the Federal Reserve Bank, in a theater in the British concession on April 9. The announcement detailed the diplomatic negotiations regarding the extradition of the four assassins, and stated that the crimes of the suspects had been thoroughly investigated by the Japanese side and confirmed by a certain representative of the British authorities who participated in the investigation, but the British side refused to hand them over. It is now useless to continue negotiations with the British side on this matter. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Judging from the situation, the Japanese authorities in Beiping and Tianjin, who strongly accuse the British and French concessions in Tianjin of being a "den of anti-Japanese terrorism," seem to have intensified their attitude towards the concessions. The Japanese Consul-General, Tashiro, and a Japanese military commander came here from Tianjin last night and secretly discussed with Japanese military leaders and Horinouchi, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy, ​​this morning. It is said that they discussed the "isolation" measures against the British and French concessions, which will be implemented from Wednesday. Well-informed sources believe that since the British side refused to hand over the murderers of Cheng Xigeng, the Japanese authorities' attitude towards the British and French concessions has become increasingly tough and unwilling to compromise. It is now believed that the result of this "isolation" will be a de facto blockade of the two concessions. It is reported that Japanese official circles regard the British action as "an uncompromising attitude and a demonstration of obstructing the Japanese efforts to establish a new order in East Asia." (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>British Public Opinion Greatly Indignant</p>
<p>London: The Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin and the threat to the life of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to China, have attracted widespread attention here. Most newspapers are carrying news reports of this kind under large headlines. The diplomatic correspondent of The Times said that the Tianjin crisis is the worst situation that Britain has encountered in the Sino-Japanese War. Cables have been exchanged incessantly between the British government and the British ambassador to China and the British Consul-General in Shanghai over the past week. Sir Robert Craigie, the British ambassador to Japan, is also cooperating in an effort to find a way to mediate the current situation. However, at present, the Japanese side will not consider anything unless the British side accepts its demands. Powerful circles in London are now exerting strong pressure on the government to take concrete action to protect British interests in China. When the House of Commons meets tomorrow, Lord Airlie's appeal in the House of Lords yesterday, advocating a ban on Japanese ships entering the ports of Singapore and Penang, will be raised again. It is reported that a powerful delegation will visit Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler tomorrow to discuss everything, especially to urge the implementation of consular certificates for exports from China, to strengthen the defenses of the British forces in Shanghai, and to implement other plans as necessary according to the circumstances. Responsible sources say that in recent months, British public opinion towards Japan has hardened considerably, and even newspapers that have traditionally been pro-Japanese have changed their attitude. The government's answer in the House of Commons that "this matter is currently being negotiated with Tokyo" only elicits ridicule. All quarters are now earnestly claiming that the Japanese military's infringement on British rights is increasing, and it will not stop unless Britain makes it clear that it is prepared to take retaliatory action. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Britain is Seeking Ways to Resolve the Situation</p>
<p>London: Reuters has learned that the British government has recently suggested to Japan that a committee be formed with one Briton, one Japanese, and one national from a neutral country, with the national from a neutral country as chairman, to determine whether the four Chinese demanded by the Japanese side in Tianjin are guilty and should be extradited. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the News Chronicle, Bartlett, has learned that the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has recently warned the Japanese government of the danger of a British-Japanese conflict in Tianjin. In Bartlett's opinion, the deadlock caused by the British refusal to hand over the four Chinese in the British concession could be resolved by a committee composed of an equal number of British and Japanese representatives, with a national from a neutral country as chairman. This committee could investigate all the evidence and decide whether the Chinese should be handed over to the Japanese side. If these suggestions are rejected by the Japanese side, a very serious crisis may occur. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today regarding the Tianjin situation that the Japanese side believed that the British reply was unsatisfactory and had now taken measures to isolate the concession. Although the current situation is serious, negotiations are still in progress and it is hoped that a solution can be agreed upon. Butler continued that the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the former Federal Reserve Bank manager and newly appointed customs superintendent, inside the British concession on April 9 was the first act of violence in the British concession since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The perpetrator was a Chinese who escaped on the spot. The Public Works Department immediately requested the cooperation of the Japanese side and carried out several searches within the concession. As a result, several people were arrested. The Japanese side identified these four people as members of a terrorist group related to the assassination. These four people were handed over to the Japanese side for interrogation and confessed that they had been involved in the assassination, but later, when they were returned to the British concession Public Works Department for detention, they recanted their confessions. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>London Newspapers Consider the Situation Thorny</p>
<p>London: The current situation in Tianjin, China, has recently been commented on by various newspapers here, all expressing anxiety. The Times stated, "The Japanese garrison in Tianjin has placed Britain in a thorny situation, unseen since the outbreak of war between China and Japan. The British concession in Tianjin has 3,000 British nationals, 2,000 residents of other countries, and 45,000 Chinese residents. If a solution is not reached in time, the entire British concession will be blockaded, at which time trade with the outside world will be completely stopped, and no goods other than food will be able to be transported into the concession. The Japanese side has made full preparations for the blockade. Army units have set up posts in many places on the orders of the commander of the North China Garrison Army. At the same time, the British concession authorities have also taken various measures to guard against it. The origin of the matter is that the Japanese military authorities demanded the extradition of four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case, but this was rejected by the British concession authorities. These Chinese are still being detained by the British concession authorities. The British government is unwilling to allow their extradition until it obtains conclusive evidence proving their guilt." The Liberal News Chronicle stated that this matter could be resolved by a joint committee composed of an equal number of British and Japanese people. This committee should have a national from a neutral country as its chairman. (Havas Agency Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin Newspapers Support Japan</p>
<p>Berlin: The situation in Tianjin, China, has recently been published by various evening newspapers under large headlines. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated that the current concession system in China should be completely revised. The National Socialist Party organ, the Völkischer Beobachter, stated, "The situation in Tianjin is gradually developing, and Japan is fighting against foreign interference." The newspaper also published a dispatch from a correspondent in Shanghai stating, "Japan's demands are bound to be adhered to to the end. It should be known that after the Axis powers of Germany and Italy have increased their position in Europe, the situation in the Far East will inevitably be affected." (Havas Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Clarity of British Diplomacy</h3>
<p>In his important speech to the British Parliament the day before yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax elucidated Britain's current foreign policy. As reported in today's newspapers, his statements were grounded in reality, his arguments were detailed and clear, his scope was broad, and the issues involved were of great importance. Every attitude he expressed towards every matter was extremely candid, leaving no room for "misunderstanding," and extremely firm, showing that it could not be swayed. The function of a foreign policy speech must have its maximum limit, and Lord Halifax's speech the day before yesterday should achieve the maximum effect. If it fails to clarify confusion or contribute to the difficulties of the time, then there must be factors other than diplomacy that weaken its due function.</p>
<p>British diplomacy has historically enjoyed a high reputation. Although judged by human civilization or weighed against the principles of communal justice, it will receive vastly different evaluations depending on the time and circumstances, especially due to its tendency to treat everything as expendable, which is often criticized by commentators. However, its self-serving calculations are truly superior, as commonly acknowledged by historians and not merely the opinion of a single party. In the past two years or so, Chamberlain has been in power. Although nearly twenty years have passed since the European War, the scars remain fresh and the lingering fears have not dissipated. Furthermore, the economic panics of recent years have made those bearing the heavy responsibility of national affairs feel as if they are treading on thin ice. At the same time, a violent atmosphere has permeated Europe and Asia, the international order and moral principles are riddled with holes, and the destructive forces secretly accumulated by those who destroy order and morality are rapidly surpassing the strength of Britain and its allies. Therefore, British diplomacy under Chamberlain has almost completely undermined its historical reputation. Its traditional diplomatic style, which was once able to navigate with ease, now leads to mistakes at every turn. First, it is cautious about self-preservation and fails to fully trust and support even its allies, resulting in alienation. Second, it seeks to befriend the strong and violent, but is seen by them as easy to manipulate, leading to deception and insult. Third, it disregards the weak and small, or offers occasional sympathy but fails to follow through; or it feigns cooperation but is not trusted by the weak and small; or it even sacrifices them. In short, British diplomacy a few months ago was vacillating, counterproductive, hesitant, isolated, and忍氣吞聲(swallowing insults) to the point of being unable to preserve itself. The facts are all vividly before us, without the need for further elaboration. It was not until the fall of Czechoslovakia that it began to change and enter a new phase.</p>
<p>Since the new phase did not begin today, why emphasize Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's speech the day before yesterday so strongly? Did Lord Halifax's long-winded speech the day before yesterday contain new meaning or new suggestions? No, it did not. For example, the key points of (1) not allowing unilateral alteration of existing treaties in the Far East, (2) defending British rights and commerce in China with all its strength, (3) not withdrawing troops from Shanghai, and (4) not accepting Japanese sophistry have all been repeatedly stated by Britain. However, there are aspects that should be viewed separately. In the negotiations for the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, British propaganda often claimed that it did not involve the Far East, which can only be seen as showing favor to Japan. Regardless of how the recipient views such overtures, the onlookers are skeptical. Foreign Secretary's speech yesterday can correct the misunderstandings caused by showing favor. In terms of the internal situation of the three-nation negotiations, Britain made every effort to compromise, while the Soviet Union stubbornly demanded much. In terms of the environment, aggressor nations sowed discord from the outside, and the lingering poison of appeasement threatened to stir from within. With such complex machinations, it was easy to overturn the situation. And the British Foreign Secretary's speech the day before yesterday shows that the Soviet Union's attitude is not enough to affect Britain's attitude in the Far East. The Japanese side's propaganda attacks and factual threats against Britain are increasing. Considering Britain's shrinking and cowardly behavior over the past few years, or in light of the intensity of Japan's attacks and threats, it is likely to take a calculated risk of compromising and preserving itself. The British Foreign Secretary's speech the day before yesterday is a clear response to Japan's intentions and actions. Britain's international credibility needs to be restored after the recent international turmoil, and its prestige needs to be restored. Now that it is training its troops and its strength is sufficient to restore its prestige, it has once again received the Foreign Secretary's detailed and firm statement. Who would doubt that Britain's diplomatic attitude is still obscure and ambiguous? Therefore, although the new stage of British diplomacy did not begin today, the proof of the clarity of this new stage lies in yesterday's events.</p>
<p>In addition to Halifax's speech, what is sufficient to highlight Britain's diplomatic attitude is the positive speeches made in the British Parliament the day before yesterday by Lord Cecil and Lord Elibank, one after another, for the Far East, as well as the questions raised by members of the House of Commons, such as Hana and Roberts. All these symbolize the atmosphere of the British Parliament, which is no longer as gloomy as it was in the past. The presence of a robust and clear atmosphere in the original Parliament is an important foundation for the establishment of policies in a democratic country. This is worthy of mention, even below the Foreign Secretary's speech.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Reports on Recent Battle Situation — During the Weekly Memorial Service for the Premier — Heavy Casualties Inflicted on Japanese Troops, Cash Reserves Almost Exhausted, War-Weariness Increasing Daily, China Can Achieve Final Victory</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin reported on the recent battle situation during yesterday's weekly memorial service for the Premier, stating that the collapse of the Japanese army is occurring rather quickly, and China is increasingly confident of achieving final victory. According to General He, nearly two years have passed since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. The number of Japanese casualties is estimated to be around 864,500. In April and May of this year, the Chinese army launched simultaneous counter-offensives on all fronts, and the Japanese losses were even greater than before. In total, 105,737 Japanese soldiers were killed at that time. General He stated that this number is based on detailed written reports from Chinese generals, showing that the Japanese army has almost exhausted its offensive capabilities. After suffering heavy losses, the Japanese army feels that it lacks the strength to continue advancing westward. General He stated that in April and May, the Chinese army captured 1,554 Japanese and puppet soldiers alive, shot down 36 Japanese aircraft, and recaptured 104 towns. "From the past two months of combat experience, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) The morale of the Japanese army is weaker than before; (2) Once the Japanese army leaves the transportation lines, its mobility is sharply reduced, and the difficulty of obtaining supplies increases; (3) The number of Japanese casualties is too high, making replenishment difficult; (4) Due to the uncertainty of the war's objectives, the extension of transportation lines, and the endless nature of the war, the war-weariness and anti-war sentiment within the Japanese army continue to increase; (5) The Japanese army's cash reserves are being depleted due to the huge military expenditures. Within Japan, they are unable to absorb the government's bond issues, and the Japanese economic structure is collapsing. Japan's natural resources have been exhausted. All of these factors have a significant impact on the Japanese people, who are struggling to survive. Their war-weariness and anti-war sentiment are increasing daily and are already manifesting in action. Therefore, the Japanese now feel unable to cope with the current environment. Finally, the Japanese should realize that it is impossible to achieve a quick victory within their ideal timeframe." General He indicated that the Chinese side has increased its combat strength in terms of the number of troops. "After each battle ends, the army is reorganized. Improvements have gradually been made in weapons, food supply, transportation equipment, intelligence, medicine, and other aspects. For example, military academies and army training camps are working hard to train a large number of outstanding officers." The Chinese authorities are smoothly carrying out conscription in all provinces according to quotas. In addition, there is a very enthusiastic response from those who voluntarily join the army. This shows that the people's sense of national consciousness is increasing, and their hatred of Japan is deepening. Chinese guerrilla forces are demonstrating their abilities behind Japanese lines, such as assisting regular troops to contain the main force of the Japanese army and exchanging significant casualties and ammunition losses for the enemy through harassing attacks. In the future, our regular army and guerrilla forces should cooperate with each other to launch continuous attacks on the enemy in all locations, so as to prevent the Japanese from developing the economy in the occupied areas. At the same time, all comrades and the people must, under the leadership of the Kuomintang and the government, devote themselves to production and construction. We must have a unified national policy so that the government can obtain various resources during the war and gradually reduce reliance on foreign countries. The day of our country's final victory will be the day of the completion of the construction of a true nation. Regarding the bombing of Chinese cities far from the front lines by Japanese aircraft, General He criticized, "This type of bombing shows the failure of the Japanese army's attacks on the front lines. They want to shake people's hearts through bombing. They hope to destroy various construction plans through this, but their evil plans have all failed. Under the Japanese policy of terror and massacre, our determination to avenge our dead relatives, wash away national humiliation, and sacrifice our personal lives for the country has been strengthened. They do not hesitate or pause for a moment in their construction efforts because of Japanese bombing. This new rationality is a major step forward in the construction of people's hearts. During the Sino-Japanese War, this progress must be maintained until our side achieves final victory." (American Associated Press dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>Japan, Germany, and Italy Negotiate to Strengthen Anti-Comintern Pact, Divergent Views Remain, Germany and Japan to Conclude New Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori arrived in Berlin today to discuss with Ambassador to Germany Oshima the Japanese proposal to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. Oshima has been in contact with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop repeatedly in the past few days. It is said that Germany is particularly dissatisfied with the slow progress of these negotiations, but the Japanese side believes it is relatively optimistic. The latest Japanese proposal was delivered here a week ago, but it has not yet been announced. According to消息 previously transmitted from Tokyo, the level of sacrifice that the Japanese side is willing to make is still far from what the Axis powers want. That is, the Japanese side very much wants its obligations to be limited to the Far East. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<p>Japanese Influence Invades Philippine Islands</p>
<p>American Democratic Congressman Demands Congressional Investigation</p>
<p>(Washington) During yesterday's House session, Democratic Representative Alanson T. Allen requested a Congressional investigation into Japanese activities in the Philippines. According to Allen, "The evidence of Japanese aggression in the Philippines is more important than the Japanese aggression in China." Allen also pointed out that "The Japanese have illegally controlled the important industries of the Philippines and have obtained 170,000 acres of land and forests in many places. The Davao area is an independent country entirely owned by the Japanese." Allen requested the Standing Committee to conduct an immediate investigation to determine whether the United States should immediately withdraw from the Philippines or immediately take adjusted plans to deal with Japanese aggression. According to Democratic Representative Giggins, regardless of whether the Japanese are invading the Philippines, the United States should maintain jurisdiction over the Philippines before 1946 and should not withdraw from the island.

<h3>British House of Lords Discusses Far East Situation, Foreign Secretary Says No Recognition of Unilateral Treaty Abrogation, Rumor Japanese Army to Seize Shanghai Concessions on July 7, Claim British Army to Withdraw from Shanghai Entirely Untrue</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Lords discussed the diplomatic situation this afternoon. Foreign Secretary Halifax immediately delivered an important speech, in which he stated the general international situation and focused on the Far East. He listed the current issues and made practical statements on each one. Regarding the existing treaties in the Far East, he said that they were all freely signed by Britain and other countries, and Britain would not recognize any unilateral modifications. Regarding British rights and commerce in China, he said that they would be protected with all their strength. Regarding the British army and navy stationed in China, regarding the various actions taken by the Japanese side under the pretext of military needs that harm British rights, he said that the British government cannot accept them, and that such excuses are even more difficult to accept in places where military operations have already ceased. All of these statements were very firm. He also said, "I am well aware that the resolutions passed by the Council and General Assembly of the League of Nations have failed to meet the wishes of the Chinese representatives, but what the countries most deeply involved in the Far East problem considered practical has been done, and our country has fulfilled its accepted obligations without any sense of guilt. I am willing to let those who understand all the circumstances and can make a fair judgment judge." As for the Chinese currency issue, it is deeply and significantly related to British interests. "Britain has assisted China in maintaining a reasonable balance, which is necessary for China to maintain its economic strength. In summary, this is the most beneficial form of British aid to China." The fact that British interests in China have been subject to Japanese obstruction is "too numerous to list, which shows the wide scope of our country's interests in China." Such obstruction is deeply concerned by all parties. For example, Lord Elibank was concerned that the Japanese might seize the Shanghai International Settlement on July 7 of this year, the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, and expressed concern about the withdrawal of the British army from Shanghai. The Wang Zhang government should continue to send troops to the area. "I dare to formally inform Lord Elibank that the government is not blind to all kinds of threats, but the government has difficulties in dealing with this issue at this time, which I believe is understood. In short, the claim that the British army will withdraw from Shanghai is entirely untrue. As for the British Navy in China, Commander-in-Chief Noble has the full authority to deploy the ships as needed."</p>
<p>(London) During this afternoon's House of Commons session, Conservative MP Hanner asked Prime Minister Chamberlain, "The Japanese government recently declared that if its troops in Shanghai believe that their safety is threatened, it will no longer respect the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by the International Settlement. Has our government exchanged views with the governments of the United States and France on this matter?" Foreign Office official Butler immediately replied on behalf of the Prime Minister, "British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie is maintaining close contact with the French and American ambassadors on all issues that are of common concern to the United Kingdom, France, and the United States."

<h3>British Parliamentarians Mostly Advocate for Maximum Aid to China, Asserting that Japan's Infringement on British Interests Warrants Retaliatory Measures by Britain</h3>
<p>(London) During a debate on foreign affairs in the British House of Lords tonight, Lord Cecil stated, "The disputes in the ongoing war in the Far East are no different from the disputes in Europe today. I believe Lord Halifax concurs. The broad issue we must resolve is whether it is legitimate for one country to invade another in pursuit of its perceived material or political interests, and whether a country should continue its war rights over any part of a sovereign nation. This is the real question. This is what is at stake in the Far East. Japan is currently invading China, blatantly disregarding everything. This is something that certain factions in Germany must find admirable, but it is impossible in Europe today. No member of the House of Lords is without sympathy for China. If Lord Halifax would grant us a promise, not only expressing sympathy for China but also acknowledging that we should do everything within our power to help China and drive Japanese aggression out of Chinese shores, I would be delighted."</p>
<p>Lord Elibank, speaking next, said, "The situation in the Far East is even worse than before. The Yangtze River basin, once a major British commercial area, is now entirely blockaded. We are excluded, while the Japanese conduct business alone. The situation regarding tariffs and trade is also deteriorating daily. The Yokohama Specie Bank is creating banknotes with the same value as Chinese legal tender and forcing people to use them where possible. This action has achieved some success. Europeans must seek a livelihood. The British government should urgently find a way to ensure that all goods transported from Shanghai to British ports must have consular certificates. This can be done with a simple Order in Council. Britons residing in various parts of the East are in a state of fearful unrest due to the tyranny of Japanese naval and army personnel. The government should pay close attention to this. I believe the government should immediately send a note to the Japanese government stating that if Tianjin is blockaded, Britain will take retaliatory action and disallow Japanese ships from using Singapore and Penang to load and unload goods. This is a perfectly legal action under international law. If we do not use force, we must use some kind of action to counter Japan's interference with British commerce in China. There have been recent reports of the Japanese mistreating Britons. Such a situation in the Far East is truly unexpected. I do not know when it will end. There are now rumors that one of the two British battalions currently stationed in Shanghai will be transferred elsewhere in September. Two battalions are barely enough to safeguard the authority of the International Settlement. If one is withdrawn, the Japanese will surely see this as clear evidence of the British government's waning interest in the matter and will seize the opportunity to take over the International Settlement, as they have desired to do in Tianjin and Xiamen. From what I have heard, the Japanese desire to seize Shanghai is no mere rumor. July 7th marks the second anniversary of the war with China, and it is a dangerous date. Reducing the garrison in Shanghai is unwise; it should be strengthened. Why doesn't the government send more warships to prevent Japan's plan to seize the Shanghai Settlement? This action should be done in consultation with the French and American authorities. The Japanese seem to believe that the best way to deal with their so-called anti-Japanese movement in China is to manage the Chinese protected by foreign flags. They have started in Tianjin and Xiamen, and now they will apply it to Shanghai. If this action is realized, trade in Shanghai will be reduced to zero. The Chinese in the Settlement will leave as quickly as possible and move inland. This step of occupying Shanghai would be a fatal blow not only to Britain but also to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. The government should quickly find a way, lest it be too late." Lord Davies stated, "Empty words of sympathy for China are worthless. Providing small loans and allowing arms shipments to China are commendable, but Lord Halifax should urge all nations to respond first to the sincere appeal recently made by the Chinese Ambassador to France, Wellington Koo, in Geneva. Currently, British policy has destroyed the British Empire's reputation for fairness and justice." Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax replied, "The war we see in the Far East is indeed related to the principle of the entire question of the right to wage war. In the past two years, the British government, in such circumstances, has considered its responsibilities, what it should do, and what actions it can actually take. The British government has sponsored the passage of numerous resolutions by the General Assembly of the League of Nations. I am well aware that these resolutions have not met the expectations of the Chinese representatives, but they have been carried out to the extent that the major powers concerned with the Far East have deemed practically possible. I would very much like to submit Britain's measures on this matter to the judgment of those who know all the circumstances and can judge the methods by which Britain fulfills its assumed obligations. Lord Davies underestimates what the government has been able to do, such as its actions regarding the Chinese currency system at the beginning of this year. This can certainly be said to be extremely related to the currency system and British interests. Britain's action was not only for the sake of China's interests, but I believe that anyone who knows the difficulties of China will agree that the most helpful way for Britain to aid China is to enable China to maintain a relative balance on which its economic strength depends. As for British interests in China, there are indeed countless instances of the poor treatment now received from the Japanese, and the extent of the danger to Britain's position in China can be seen from this. However, the British government has never been indifferent to these threats. I think Lord Elibank will understand the difficulties faced by the government. However, I can assure him that the talk of withdrawing the Shanghai garrison is completely unfounded. As for sending more warships, the Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet has full authority to move warships as he deems necessary according to the needs of the situation. I know that the Japanese military authorities use military necessity as an excuse to restrict British rights, but the British government cannot accept this excuse as a reason to destroy the rights that Britons should enjoy under solemn treaties, especially in places where military operations have ceased. We cannot allow the Japanese to unilaterally revise treaties freely concluded between us and other countries. The points raised in this debate in the House of Lords are all matters that have been repeatedly discussed with the responsible Japanese authorities. The government will continue to do its best to maintain the rights of Britons to live and operate safely in China."</p>
<h3>British Lower House Discusses the Situation of Chinese Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(London) During today's meeting of the Lower House, Labour MP Bellenger asked, "The exchange rate of Chinese legal tender has fallen significantly. What is the reason for this? And has the equalization fund stopped operating?" Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, in his reply, cited a communiqué issued by Hong Kong on June 8. Mr. Bellenger then asked, "If the Chinese legal tender equalization fund does not aim to maintain the stability of Chinese legal tender, and Chinese legal tender is devalued as a result, is the fund no longer of any benefit?" Simon replied, "I do not believe that it has ceased to be of any benefit." Simon again asked Mr. Bellenger to read the communiqué issued by Hong Kong. Mr. Bellenger again asked, "Has the British part of the fund stopped operating?" Simon again cited the Hong Kong communiqué, saying that it was difficult to provide any better news than that. According to the Hong Kong communiqué to which Simon referred, which was released to Reuters by the responsible parties in Hong Kong, it explained the reasons why the Sino-British Equalization Fund Committee no longer assisted Chinese legal tender, and stated that the credit of Chinese legal tender was not shaken, but that the committee's action was temporary in nature, intending to allow the exchange rate of legal tender to reach a better economic level, so that the balance of trade could be commensurate.

<h3>Halifax Statement: Foreign Policy Unchanged; Guarantee to Poland Clear and Concrete; Those Who Resort to Force Will Meet with Forceful Resistance</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax declared during a debate on foreign affairs in the House of Lords today that any action that threatens Poland's independence will ignite a prairie fire, and Britain will be drawn into it. The guarantee we have given to Poland is clear and concrete. What we want to make thoroughly clear is that if force is resorted to today, those who use force will encounter forceful resistance.</p>
<p>Today's debate began with a speech by former Secretary of War Lord Mottistone. Mr. Mottistone acknowledged that he was a firm believer in appeasement. Lord Stonehaven, the recently appointed chairman of the Conservative Party, asked the Foreign Secretary to continue speaking about the detention of British military officer Spear by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou, saying that Mr. Spear's actions did not involve any conspiracy as alleged by the Japanese. Regardless of any suspicions the Japanese may have had, they should not have detained him even when he proved his identity. According to the interpreter Cooper's report, the Japanese treatment of Mr. Spear was still appropriate, and there is currently no reason to say that the matter cannot be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary later spoke about the murder of Dinggler, an employee of the Pootung Lungchang Company, saying that the facts of the case had not yet been fully investigated, but that the government had very dissatisfied views regarding the circumstances of his injury and death immediately afterward. The government had instructed the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to lodge a protest and reserved the right to demand compensation after the facts were ascertained. (Reuters, 12th) The Foreign Secretary said that he was prepared to make concessions on colonial issues and that we had a very heavy responsibility to the natives of the areas involved. Lord Cecil, chairman of the League of Nations Association, called for the re-establishment of the broad principles of the League of Nations. Lord Davies, a colleague of Mr. Cecil, expressed dissatisfaction with the Foreign Secretary's speech on June 8, saying that it had created the impression that Britain was preparing for suspicious collusion with aggressor nations. He said, "God forbid that a second Munich should undo the goodwill and respect of the American people that the King and Queen's visit to America has won." Press tycoon Lord Rothermere said he supported the policy of appeasement, and that Germany had not yet challenged Britain's vital interests individually.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary replied that his speech on June 8 (announcing Britain's willingness to discuss Germany's or other countries' demands at a round table conference) was because the opposition party had already chosen that day to debate foreign affairs. In any case, it was difficult to say that the release of the truth was too early or too late. Regarding the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, it was both unprofitable and impossible to release details now. This had to wait for the discussions of Foreign Office official Strang in Moscow. Everything agreed with other governments would be made public. The government had not forgotten for a moment all the colonial problems raised by Lord Stonehaven just now. At the present stage, he did not want to say anything further about this. Regarding the Danzig issue, if serious and dangerous consequences were to be avoided, extreme patience and self-control were required.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then reiterated Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement that Britain wished to see a peaceful resolution of the Polish-German dispute, but that if the situation was to be changed by force and Poland's independence was endangered, it would inevitably lead to a prairie fire involving Britain. The Foreign Secretary said at the end of the debate that his speech on June 8 had been given all sorts of contradictory interpretations by those who heard it, with some focusing on this sentence and others focusing on that sentence. In fact, the entire speech should be studied. He thought that the meaning of the speech was very clear, but some people had even said that British foreign policy had changed. He wished to state here that British foreign policy had not changed. His speech on June 8 was intended to make the people at home and abroad understand the truth of the government's response to the situation. There were two points in British policy that he wanted to explain: one was not to make threats or contain conspiracies, but to make the world understand that if force was used, those who used it would meet with a situation of using force to resist force; and the other was that if there was no intention to resort to force, it could not be underestimated, Britain's strength would be poured into negotiations to seek a fair solution. If such a debate could shift the attention of all countries and realize the dangerous methods of abandoning the use of force, and instead use the efforts of negotiation and reconciliation, which would be more beneficial, he would be pleased.

<h3>US House Appropriations Committee Approves Additional Funding for the Army, Totaling $296.6 Million; Number of Aircraft Increased to 5,500</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Army Department's request for additional funding, totaling $296,695,547, has been approved by the House Appropriations Committee. The allocation is as follows: (1) $189,845,547 to add 2,467 aircraft, bringing the total number of Army aircraft to 5,500 by July 1941; (2) $61,600,000 to add new air force bases and improve existing bases; (3) $27,000,000 to increase the garrison in the Panama Canal Zone from 3,916 to 9,916 personnel. (Havas dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently requested Congress to allocate $650 million to expand the Air Force and increase the number of military aircraft to 5,500. The case was submitted to a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee for review, and the famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh was asked to give his opinion. It is said that "Although our country's civilian aircraft are superior to those of European countries, our military aircraft are inferior. Regarding this level of the military, our country wants to regain a leading position in scientific research, which cannot be achieved in three to five years." It was decided to ask General Arnold, head of the Army Department's Aviation Bureau, to give his opinion, which was as follows: "Our country's goal in the Air Force is to focus on defense, which is different from the focus on attack in European countries. For this reason, we must build fast fighter planes, whose speed is above that of enemy bombers, which is the right way to proceed. What the government is currently working on is precisely this. The Army Department has recently ordered 524 "Curtis" fighters, with a speed of 644 kilometers per hour. Moreover, in terms of our country's "Flying Fortress" bombers, no country in the world can compare with it. Our country's plan to expand the Air Force is intended to give the people a guarantee that although the German Air Force has several types of aircraft that are superior to ours, our defense in the sky is extremely adequate, and we can rest easy."

<p>US House Discusses New Neutrality Law</p>
<p>Restrictions on Trade Passed by Foreign Affairs Committee</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government's new neutrality law is now not far from formal implementation, as the restrictions on trade in the Bloom Bill were formally passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday. According to the bill, all American citizens, once the President has designated a combat zone, may not accept the patronage of belligerent nations, and may not lend loans and credit to belligerent nations, but medicines and clothing and food items will naturally be exceptions. The Bloom Bill was formed according to Hull's party-building principles, so the above-mentioned restrictions will not be applied to Latin American countries. (Associated Press dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Foreign Affairs Committee met today to continue discussing the amendment to the Neutrality Act, and immediately voted to pass the first six sections of the amendment proposed by Chairman Bloom without much modification. It is expected that the discussion can be completed tomorrow, and the new draft Neutrality Act will be submitted to the House, and will soon be placed on the agenda. According to what the Foreign Affairs Committee should discuss tomorrow, it is the seventh section of the Bloom Bill, the content of which is related to the entry of warships of various belligerent nations into US ports.</p>
<p>Citing the Excuse of Avoiding Involvement in the War, Isolationist Independents Try to Obstruct</p>
<p>Representative Fische of New York, a Republican, recently gave a press conference, saying that he would give a radio broadcast speech and express his views at the House meeting to oppose the Bloom Bill, honestly because the case is called neutrality, "in fact, it is dominated by interventionism." If it is allowed to be established, President Roosevelt will have the power to designate war zones, allowing the United States to continue trade with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, but not with Germany and Italy. The impact is that the United States must join forces with Britain to fight, which should be avoided. Political figures believe that Fische's opposition is quite powerful and should not be underestimated, but the Bloom Bill can still be passed by the House. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>

<p>Quebec City, Hill White Block, when the King and Queen crossed the Canadian border in their royal train, 100,000 people gathered to welcome them. A parade will be held in the town of Rivière-du-Loup tonight. The farewell to the King and Queen in Quebec will end here. The small town usually has a population of 8,000, but it is expected to increase fivefold this time. (Reuters dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) King George today cabled President Roosevelt to express his gratitude for the hospitality of President Roosevelt and his wife for the past four days. The original text stated, "The Queen and I are deeply grateful for the hospitality of Mrs. Roosevelt and Your Excellency for the past four days. The kindness that Mrs. Roosevelt and Your Excellency have given to us is not only a personal friendship, but also a feeling shared by the people of your country. We are grateful for this. Whether in Washington or New York, everything we have experienced has been a warm welcome. Although our visit to your great country has been very brief, the sincerity and goodwill that your country has given to us will always be cherished by us. We have no way to repay Your Excellency and the kindness of your country's people, so we especially send this letter to express our gratitude." (Associated Press dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Hull Receives Ambassador to Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) US Ambassador to Japan Grew has returned to his country to report on his work and has arrived here. Today, he met with Secretary of State Hull, Undersecretary of State Welles, and other key members of the State Department to discuss the recent situation in the Far East. According to Secretary of State Hull, the discussion today was only on general issues, and continued talks will be held in the next few days. President Roosevelt is scheduled to return to Beijing tomorrow, and Ambassador Grew will also pay a visit to submit a report. After staying in Washington for a few days, he will go north for a short period of rest, and then return to Washington to continue talks with the authorities. (Havas dispatch of the 12th)</p>

<p>Hull Invites Germany and Italy to Join US Commercial Agreement</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull made a formal statement here today inviting Germany and Italy to join the US reciprocal commercial agreement plan. Hull said the United States hopes that in the coming years, all countries can join this plan. If the two major countries conclude a differentiated method of dividing their spheres of influence, other countries will inevitably adopt economic plans for self-defense, and the result will not be able to promote peace, economic recovery and progress, but will only lead to the common subversion of all countries. The economic survival of small countries that conclude such methods with large countries will gradually depend on large countries, and eventually become political appendages of large countries.

<p>German Chief of Staff Scheduled to Visit Estonia and Finland at the End of the Month</p>
<p>(Berlin) At the invitation of the commanders-in-chief of the armies of Estonia and Finland, German Chief of Staff General Halder will visit these countries at the end of this month. Political figures here attach great importance to General Halder's visit, given that the Soviet Union, regardless of the will of the Baltic states, is trying to interfere in Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. As for whether General Halder's trip will involve special talks with these countries, it is impossible to know. (Haitong dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<h3>Responding to the Mediterranean Situation: Egyptian and Turkish Cooperation; Negotiations Between the Two Parties Have Made Progress; British-Turkish Agreement Reaches Implementation Measures</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax received the Egyptian Ambassador, Dr. Naji, yesterday morning to discuss the general situation in the Mediterranean. The ambassador reportedly informed Halifax that Egypt, Hejaz, and Yemen would join the Near East Pact. (This pact was previously signed in 1937 by Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan.) Negotiations had been conducted by the Egyptian and Turkish authorities and had recently made progress. Diplomatic circles here interpreted that the purpose of the negotiations was to enable Egypt and Turkey to cooperate closely in the event of war in the eastern Mediterranean, which is of great significance. (Havas Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) Informed Turkish sources here recently stated that the implementation measures for the British-Turkish mutual assistance agreement have been agreed upon. Britain will send a military delegation to Turkey to hold talks with the Turkish military authorities. In addition, the Turkish military delegation has been in London for many days, "negotiating with the British authorities on the purchase of military supplies. After Turkey established a mutual assistance agreement with Britain, the German authorities informed Turkey that the major military supplies ordered by Turkey from German and former Czechoslovak factories would be stopped. Therefore, the military supplies needed by Turkey would naturally be supplied by Britain. For this reason, the Turkish military delegation, accompanied by officials from the British War Office, has been inspecting various factories. They will also exchange views with the British General Staff on cooperation between the two countries' navies and armies in the Balkans and the Near East. However, the nature of the discussions will be very general. The detailed measures will be decided after the British military delegation arrives in Turkey and discusses them with the Turkish authorities. (Havas Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Baltic States: Security Issues</p>
<p>Pravda Publishes Commentary: Learning from Czechoslovakia's Example</p>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda's editorial commented on the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states against aggression, stating, "Foreign newspapers continue to criticize Molotov's speech to the Supreme Soviet, particularly the section concerning the assistance that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should provide to Estonia, Latvia, and Finland when these Baltic countries are invaded and unable to defend their neutrality. Initially, some foreign newspapers believed that this issue was artificially created for some unclear purpose. Now they have to admit that this estimate was wrong, and guaranteeing the neutrality of the three countries is of great importance to the security of the Soviet Union. Another group opposes raising this issue, claiming that it has no real connection with Britain and France. They have also admitted their error. The current state of negotiations shows that Britain and France are no less concerned than the Soviet Union about maintaining the neutrality of the three Baltic states. British Conservative politicians such as Churchill have also had to admit that this issue is very important to Britain and France. He advocated providing guarantees to Latvia, Estonia, and Finland, saying, 'If Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are invaded by the Nazis, or if they are forced to adopt Nazism through internal propaganda and conspiracies, all of Europe will be drawn into war. In other words, if the independence and integrity of the three countries are destroyed, Poland will have to go to war, and consequently, Britain, France, and Russia will all have to go to war.' However, although most foreign newspapers now admit that Molotov's proposal to assist the Baltic states is correct in principle, they are still reluctant to draw the necessary practical conclusions on this issue. Some people say that the guarantees of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are not in line with the rights and interests of the three Baltic states, claiming that these countries do not need external assistance to defend their independence and resist aggression. This is certainly wrong. For example, Czechoslovakia had twice as many people and troops as all three countries combined, but because it was isolated and without assistance, it could not defend itself. How can these three small Baltic countries be superior to Czechoslovakia? From this point of view, it is only natural that the people of the three countries welcome the guarantees of independence from peaceful great powers. Others claim that if the three countries accept assistance from powerful neighbors, it is equivalent to losing their sovereignty and independence. This statement is completely absurd. Britain has provided assistance guarantees to France, Poland, and Turkey, and these countries have also guaranteed assistance to Britain. Belgium's neutrality is guaranteed by Britain and France. Have these countries lost their sovereignty and independence as a result? Finally, some British and French newspapers say that the official representatives of the three countries have expressed their refusal of assistance from peaceful nations, claiming that they do not need assistance and other countries cannot force it upon them. Estonian Foreign Minister Selter and Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko have made such statements. Regarding this point, if there is no misunderstanding, then there is some malicious attempt to sabotage the organization of the anti-aggression defense line of peaceful nations. The article mentioned earlier that the people of the three countries greatly welcome the assistance given by peaceful countries when their countries are directly or indirectly invaded. This is an undeniable fact. If so, then why did Selter and Erkko refuse the assistance of peaceful nations? The reason for this may be that the above-mentioned politicians underestimate the threat of aggression. Not long ago, our newspaper pointed out that Romania and Poland also had this tendency to underestimate the threat. Some of their representatives not only opposed the Soviet Union's guarantees to them, but also opposed the establishment of an assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Subsequently, the environment has forced these opposing claims to be withdrawn. In the near future, some representatives of the three Baltic states may also withdraw their opposing claims. This possibility exists because the threat of aggression has become increasingly clear, as detailed in President Roosevelt's recent note. At the same time, it is also because the inherent needs of the three countries and the assistance of peaceful nations to resist aggression will make them recognize it more clearly. However, regarding the attitude of the above-mentioned politicians of Estonia and Finland, there seems to be another explanation. It is entirely possible that they have been influenced by foreign countries, even if they are not directly manipulated by those who are trying to hinder the formation of a broad anti-aggression front. It is difficult for us to determine who is manipulating them at present. Aggressor countries are inherently intent on destruction, but some reactionary forces within democratic countries are also trying to limit aggression to certain areas and allow it to run rampant elsewhere. Henri de Kérillis, a well-known right-wing journalist from the French bourgeoisie, also believes that this assumption is possible, which is a very important sign. From this point of view, the final opposition to Molotov's guarantee of the Baltic states from aggression, from the perspective of the interests of the anti-aggression front of peaceful nations, is also baseless, and is the same as the other items. Therefore, the Soviet Union's position on guaranteeing the Baltic states from aggression is the only correct position, and is fully in line with the interests of all peace-loving nations, including Estonia, Latvia, and Finland.

<h3>Japanese Troops Occupy Hainan Island: Britain and France Maintain Close Liaison</h3>
<p>(London) Opposition Labour MP Roberts asked in the House of Commons that, after the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island and the Xisha Islands, the interests held by Britain and France in the Far East have been threatened. Has the government exchanged views with the French government, or does it intend to do so? Foreign Office official Butler immediately replied, "According to the information received by Foreign Secretary Halifax, Japanese troops have occupied part of Hainan Island, and it does not appear that there has been a military occupation of the Xisha Islands. Regarding this matter, the government is maintaining close liaison with the French government." (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Bishop Yu Pin Broadcasts at the New York World's Fair: Expresses Gratitude to Pittman for His Sympathy Towards China: Hopes the United States Will Quickly Relieve Chinese Refugees: And Welcomes Large-Scale American Investment in China</h3>
<p>New York Dispatch. After the opening of the New York World's Fair, celebrities from various countries in New York were invited to broadcast speeches. On the evening of May 23rd, at 10:00 PM, the Fair invited Bishop Yu Pin to give a broadcast, with an audience of over 10 million people. Yu's broadcast content was divided into three points: (1) Regarding Pittman's amendment to the Neutrality Act, he believes that if the embargo on military supplies to aggressor countries can be effectively stipulated and implemented, it can be considered a fundamental solution. He expressed gratitude for Pittman's sympathy towards the invaded countries and his support for China. (2) The most urgent matter at present is to relieve Chinese refugees. During the great famine in Tsarist Russia in previous years, the United States donated 70 million US dollars. Now, China is being invaded by a powerful neighbor, and the entire Chinese nation is fighting heroically for independence, survival, and human justice. There are 30 million refugees in the war zone, whose suffering is unprecedented, but the donations received are only 1 million US dollars. China and the United States have always had a strong relationship, and China is also fighting for the democratic principles that the United States believes in. He hopes that the entire American people will rise up to help. (3) Since the start of the War of Resistance, China has been actively carrying out economic construction projects in the northwest and southwest provinces, and the future development is immeasurable. He hopes that Americans will actively invest and welcome large-scale participation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Guangdong: The Recent Battle Situation is Tight and Loose: Japanese Troops Barely Maintain Their Strongholds: More Troops of the Northwest River Army Were Annihilated</h3>
<p>Shaoguan Correspondence. The Japanese army is still actively reinforcing its troops for military operations in Guangdong, so the battle situation in the East, West, and North Rivers is sometimes tight and sometimes loose. The recent situation is as follows:</p>
<p>North River. Chinese and Japanese troops still use Conghua and Huaxian as the front lines. The Japanese troops in Longkou on the Guanghua Road have recently received reinforcements and frequently harass the Chinese army's positions. On the morning of May 31, the Japanese troops in Longkou sent hundreds of infantry and cavalry in two directions: one route sneaked to the areas east of Pingshan, including Sanxiang Mountain and Jiuchuan Lake, and the other route spied on Lianglongxu on the Guanghua Line, with about 200 people at each location. After reaching each place, they carried out extensive searches of the villages, arrested strong men, and forcibly injected poisonous needles into the villagers. Upon receiving the report, Zhao's division of the Chinese defenders immediately sent teams to intercept and annihilate them in separate directions. The Japanese troops only resisted slightly before fleeing in a panic along the original route. As a result, the Chinese army killed dozens of Japanese soldiers and seized many poisons and toxic liquids. Over a hundred villagers were arrested by the Japanese troops. On the Qianxin Street section along the Yuehan Railway, the Japanese troop movements are also very busy, with military vessels running non-stop all day long. Zhao's division of the Chinese army in that area suddenly attacked the Japanese troops in Qianxin Street on the morning of the 1st of this month, with one route bypassing Letong to the south along the railway and attacking the front of the Japanese troops, and the other route flanking from the side of Huangqi Mountain, engaging the Japanese troops in close combat in the northwestern suburbs of Qianxin Street. The Japanese troops bombarded the Chinese army's positions with artillery. A certain regiment of the Chinese army was exceptionally brave, breaking into the Japanese positions and charging in hand-to-hand combat. The battle was extremely fierce. After two hours of stalemate, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand and fled back to Qianxin Street, stubbornly resisting. In this battle, nearly a hundred Japanese troops were killed and more than twenty firearms were captured. As for Huangqi Mountain near Qianxin Street, it is still surrounded by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops have repeatedly attacked, but they have been repelled. However, the Japanese troops have not given up. On the afternoon of the 2nd, they sent a reconnaissance plane to scout around Huangqi Mountain for a long time. At about 2:00 PM, two Japanese planes arrived over the area again and continuously dropped more than ten bombs on the Chinese army's positions. Fortunately, the Chinese army evacuated properly and there was no damage. The Japanese planes only destroyed more than thirty nearby civilian houses, killing and injuring several villagers.</p>
<p>East River. The troops of both sides on the East River are still in a standoff across the Zeng River, with no major contact between Zeng and Bo. The Chinese army on the Zengcong Line is very active, constantly attacking the Japanese troops. On the night of the 30th of last month, the Lin Junsheng unit of the Third District Guerrilla Column, along with the special service team of Peng's division, totaling over a hundred people, charged into Zhongxin Market in two routes. They engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops near the Guanyin Temple. That night, the moonlight was dim. The Japanese troops, unaware of the actual situation, ran around in confusion, stubbornly resisting in a panic. While engaging the Japanese troops, the Chinese army set fire to two Japanese military sheds and factories at the market entrance, and safely retreated around 10:30 PM, capturing two Japanese military horses and killing several Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops were extremely angry about the attack that night. After the Chinese army retreated, they imposed a curfew that night, extensively searching all the shops in the market and arresting more than a dozen coolies who were sleeping in the open, accusing them of being guerrillas and brutally torturing them. On the morning of the 1st of this month, in order to continue attacking the Japanese troops, Peng's division specially ordered a certain unit to advance towards Zhucun. At about 10:00 AM that morning, they approached Zhucun and came into contact with the Japanese troops in the nearby Songgang. The Japanese troops stubbornly defended their positions, resisting with dense machine gun fire. The Chinese army also did not avoid hardship and continued to advance. In the afternoon, they occupied the strongholds of Shiqiaotou and Dagang north of Zhucun. Zhucun was under the control of the Chinese army. The Guangzeng Highway may be cut off by the Chinese army at any time. As for the south bank of the East River, the fighting is relatively quiet because the Japanese troops are mostly entrenched. The Japanese troops, who are entrenched in Wanheng, Shilong, and Taiping, have been constantly pressured by various corps of the Chinese army. In an attempt to break through the Chinese army's line, they have repeatedly decided to send troops to attack the Chinese army's positions. However, the Chinese army is strong and heavily guarded, and the Japanese troops have been repeatedly repelled. The Japanese troops, knowing that it is not easy to achieve their goal, have not made any changes in the past half month and have only adopted a defensive posture. However, in the above-mentioned areas, they are actively promoting the puppet government and arranging defenses. On the 1st of this month, more than 200 Japanese soldiers were sent to Wanheng and Shilong to increase their defenses. The Japanese troops sent to Shilong were stationed at the railway station, and a part of the Japanese troops sent to Wanheng were sent to the Wanzhang Highway for guard duty on the 3rd. Judging from their intentions, it is to prevent the Chinese army from counterattacking. Zhang Zuxun, the puppet county magistrate of Dongguan, recently received orders from the Japanese army to organize a puppet pacification team to lure villagers to participate by means of threats and inducements, claiming that they were tasked with pacifying local security and searching for bandits, the same as the police. In reality, the Japanese side is exhausted of manpower and fears that it will not be able to maintain the existing strongholds, so it wants to use the villagers to control the Chinese with the Chinese. As for the Chinese army in that area, it has achieved many victories since being ordered to attack on May 5. It is learned that certain units have also been fighting for a long time, and various aspects of manpower and materials need to be adjusted and supplemented. Therefore, they are taking the opportunity to eliminate the old and weak and replenish the elite, in order to improve the basic quality. Also, a certain unit of the Chinese army operating on the Shi (An) Tai (Ping) Road mixed into Taiping Huanzhi Township on the 1st of this month and killed the puppet township chief Li Duanxia. On Li's body, they found a "Toramon District Narahara Unit" badge.</p>
<p>West River. There is more contact between the troops of both sides between the West River and the North River. The Chinese army in that area is gradually pressing towards the Japanese army, and is harassing the Japanese army with a strategy of elusiveness. Zhao's division, which is fighting on the Chan-Tan Line, is attacking Fengyong Guanyao. As for the Japanese troops entrenched in Fengyong, since the main force that sneaked into Tanbu on the 14th of last month was defeated, they have been surrounded and annihilated by Zhao's division in recent weeks. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the harassment, abandoned the nearby strongholds such as Wengang and Xianggang, and retreated to defend Fengyong and Guanyao. Zhao's division continued to attack the Japanese army. The fierce fighting has not stopped since the 29th. In the past few days, more than a hundred Japanese troops have been annihilated. On the morning of the 1st of this month, the Japanese troops specially shortened their defense lines and retreated to defend the Jinshan Temple and other positions. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to pursue them. The Japanese troops fled south across the river in a panic, abandoning many supplies and documents. There is now no trace of Japanese troops in the Fengyong and Shitang areas. When the Japanese troops in Fengyong withdrew to the south, they extensively looted all the grain and property in the entire market, and demolished the wooden bridge connecting the Chan-Tan Line to the Jinshan Temple, hoping to prevent the Chinese army from pursuing them. In order to completely annihilate the Japanese troops, Zhao's division continued to advance south. On the morning of the 2nd of this month, the Chinese army launched a clear attack on the Japanese troops in Jinshan Temple, with one route pressing from Fengyong and the other route advancing eastward from Guanyao, cutting off the Japanese army's support on the Chan-Tan Road. That day, artillery battles were launched near Jinshan Temple. The roaring sound echoed far and wide. At noon, the Chinese officers and soldiers, taking advantage of the artillery fire cover, rallied their spirits and attacked the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops also stubbornly resisted, and the battle situation was quite fierce. It was still in a stalemate at dusk, but the Chinese army had already occupied a dominant position, and the Jinshan Temple stronghold could be recovered soon. Also, along the Chan-Tan Line from Fengyong Jinshan Temple to Foshan, the Japanese troops have been very busy transporting supplies in recent days, and Japanese soldiers have also been frequently mobilized. It was discovered that on the morning of May 30, more than a dozen Japanese vehicles, fully loaded with military supplies, were transported from Foshan to Fengyong, and more than 200 Japanese soldiers were sent to the Jinshan Temple area to increase their defenses. In order to contain the Japanese army's transportation, the guerrillas who are active on that line gathered more than a hundred team members that night and launched a night attack on Songgang Market. They and dozens of daredevils charged into the market and engaged in a mixed battle with the Japanese troops. The rest carried explosives and destroyed and blew up the nearby highways. The Japanese soldiers, hearing the sound of gunfire, were awakened and responded, and sent teams to search, but in the dark, they could not use their powerful artillery fire, and only randomly fired machine guns at the Chinese army. They waited until about 3:00 AM the next day, when the Chinese team members had completed their mission and triumphantly retreated. That night, more than ten Japanese sentries were annihilated, and more than twenty zhang of the nearby highways were dug up and blown up.</p>
<p>As for the Japanese troops west of Lubao, on the 29th, they sent more than 600 infantry, cavalry, and artillery, along with three airplanes, to harass along the Lu-Xi Road. They used artillery to cover their advance. Chen's division of the Chinese army, along with the tax police corps and the Ou Hanzhang unit of guerrillas, fought back in separate directions in Huangtang, Nanbian Market, Qucun, Niulan and other places. After holding out until dusk, the Chinese army waited for the Japanese troops to become exhausted and then launched a counterattack. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand and retreated along the original route, abandoning many supplies and ammunition. In this battle, the Chinese army annihilated more than a hundred Japanese troops. When the Japanese troops retreated, they set fire to and looted along the way, causing the villages of Lucun, Nanbian Market, Niulangang, and Qucun to be burned and looted. The people fled to Lubao in droves. On the morning of the 30th, Chen's division and the tax police corps, in order to sweep away the remaining Japanese troops in one go, tracked and searched them, advancing along the Lu-Xi Road. At noon, they encountered the Japanese troops in Yangmei and Buyuetang, and another fierce battle broke out. The officers and soldiers of a certain battalion of the Chinese army bravely charged into the Japanese positions and engaged the Japanese troops in hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. After two hours of fighting, the Chinese army retreated and defended the dangerous terrain northwest of Yangmei, monitoring the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops, having suffered repeated military setbacks, mostly retreated back to the southwest towns belonging to Sanshui County, with only a small part guarding Yangmei and Baoyuetang along the Lu-Xi Road. Also, on the morning of the 29th, more than 200 Japanese infantry and cavalry, coming from Sanshui along the Si-San Highway, arrived at Heigang and Mao'ergang near Mumian, and used small steel cannons to bombard the old Sanshui coastline of Zhuzhou, Wanggang, and Hantang, and sent several motorboats and more than a hundred Russian soldiers to patrol and spy around the old Sanshui area. They were spotted by the Chinese defenders, who waited for the Japanese boats to approach and then set up a fire net to fiercely strafe the Japanese boats. The Japanese boats hurriedly returned, and as a result, one boat was sunk, and more than ten Japanese soldiers fell into the water and drowned.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Air Defense Department: Shoots Down Japanese Reconnaissance Plane: Japanese Pilot Dies of Injuries: Rumor That Xiaoan's Ancestral Tomb Was Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence. On the 7th of this month, the Zhenhai Air Defense Force shot down a Japanese plane, which crashed into the Youshan Sea outside Zhenhai Port. It was identified as an Type 89 biplane reconnaissance plane, manufactured in Italy. The pilot, whose parachute was deployed, died of injuries from the fall and was buried in Zhenhai. In this battle, the Chinese side recovered a parachute, a pistol, a flight cap, and a pair of leather boots, which were sent to Yong yesterday.</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM on the 10th, seven Japanese planes bombed Zhenhai, dropping three bombs in Xiaogang and eleven bombs in the port area. In addition to destroying more than a hundred civilian houses, killing two women and injuring one woman, the ancestral tomb of Shanghai puppet mayor Chuan Xiaoan in Qingzhi was almost completely destroyed. The coffins were shattered and the corpses were scattered. Unfilial descendants bring disaster to their ancestors, a warning.</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization Appears on Daishan Island</h3>
<p>Promoting counterfeit currency and collecting exorbitant taxes: Anti-war sentiment is very strong among Japanese soldiers</p>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence. Since Daishan Island was forcibly occupied by the Japanese army on the 22nd of last month, the local area has been ravaged and the islanders are suffering unspeakable pain, and are fleeing in droves. Gao Asheng and his ilk, shameless people, in order to cater to the Japanese side, convened a mass meeting and established a puppet autonomous association, which was reorganized on the 1st of this month into a "Maintenance Association." They forcibly forced merchants to use counterfeit currency, promoted toxic policies such as opium, gambling, and prostitution, and forced fishing boats to register, charging two yuan per boat. Afterwards, the captured fish were forced to not trade with Duopo and Dinghai, and a salt tax sub-department was established in Dongsha Corner to levy exorbitant salt taxes, which was contracted by the traitor Fan Chucai, but the levy has not yet started.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops who landed on Daishan were found to be the troops under the command of He Yin of the First Minesweeping Command, with more than 300 marines stationed in Dongsha Corner, Gaoting, and Beifeng Mountain. However, many Japanese anti-war leaflets have been appearing in the streets and lanes of Dongsha Corner in recent days, and Japanese officers are unable to control the situation. Five Japanese warships, one transport ship, one armed fishing boat, and many speedboats are currently anchored in Daishan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Qingpu Excavate Jiupingshan (Wine Bottle Mountain)</h3>
<p>Thousand-year-old historic site destroyed</p>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence. The old Qingyong town, belonging to the county, is located on the bank of Qinglong Port. About half a mile west of the town, there is a Jiupingshan (Wine Bottle Mountain), which is a historic site where Han Shizhong of the Song Dynasty rewarded his troops. It is named after the wine bottles piled up like a mountain. It was once excavated by farmers, who sold complete ones at a good price, with each bottle costing tens of yuan, but it was immediately strictly prohibited by the authorities. Until now, the historic site still exists. In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the county party department, together with the county education bureau, surrounded the mountain with wooden fences and erected a stone monument to mark the memorial. Before the war, many people from far and near came to visit, but unexpectedly, it is now coveted by the Japanese side, who forced nearby villagers to excavate it for them. The thousand-year-old historic site has been completely destroyed as a result.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Funing Search Civilian Residences</h3>
<p>Towns and cities also burned down</p>
<p>Funing Correspondence. Funing was once occupied by the Japanese army last summer, and they retreated after more than 50 days. Most of the houses in the city were burned down. In February of this year, it was lost again. The Japanese army, with only more than 200 people, did not dare to harass the countryside. However, Japanese warships often arrived at Sheyang Lake, and gasoline boats came and went, often docking at the shore. The residents, hearing the news, fled in droves. The Japanese army then searched the houses on both sides of the bank for clothes, sundries, food, etc., and transported them out to sea. Recently, bandit chiefs Zhu Baoyuan, Guo Liu, Gu and other gangs of bandits, numbering three to four hundred, were used by the Japanese army to rob the shops and goods in Donggou, Yilin, Fenggu Village, Zhanggou and other towns. They burned down the houses in Hagang, Batan, Caijiaqiao, Sanjie, Erchang and other towns, leaving them completely empty. On the 4th of this month, the Japanese army and the guerrillas opened fire in the area of Ertagou, with the Japanese army suffering more than 40 casualties. Four Japanese gasoline boats were sunk. Currently, refugees are sleeping in the open fields everywhere, and the sound of crying shakes the sky. The situation is too horrible to bear.</p>

<h3>Local News: Rumors Spread of Threats Against British Ambassador; Ambassador Takes Necessary Precautions</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 13th: According to "Daily Mail," the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has recently received several warning letters threatening his life. As a result, he is constantly surrounded by multiple bodyguards. The Ambassador and embassy staff are wearing bulletproof vests as a precaution.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that, in light of the threats against the life of British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the Shanghai Municipal Police of the International Settlement took special precautions yesterday (12th) afternoon at the British Embassy and at the Ambassador's residence at No. 50 Yu Yuen Road. The embassy offices are located in the Jardine Matheson Building. Uniformed Chinese and Western police officers are stationed at the building's entrance and in the lobby. The entire sixth floor is occupied by the embassy offices, and a Chinese constable is stationed in front of each of the two elevators on that floor. A reporter who entered the main office saw five Western detectives sitting in the waiting room, their eyes fixed on the office entrance.</p>
<p>Ambassador Has Not Received Threatening Letters</p>
<p>When a reporter questioned a senior official at the embassy, the official declined to disclose the nature of the threat. However, it was learned that the threat did not originate from official channels. The British Ambassador has not received threatening letters. Another source said last night that the police have received intelligence regarding a plot and have taken precautions accordingly.</p>
<p>Armed Escort Front and Rear of Vehicle</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at nearly 5:45 PM, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr left the embassy and walked to his car, sitting on the right side. Two detectives wearing steel mesh vests and the Ambassador's secretary were seated in the back of the car. Uniformed police officers on motorcycles traveled ahead of the Ambassador's car, while a police car with three detectives wearing steel mesh vests, all armed with pistols at the ready, followed behind to protect the Ambassador.</p>
<p>Considerable Precautions Taken at the Residence as Well</p>
<p>Similar precautions have also been taken at the Ambassador's residence. Western detectives are stationed both inside and outside the residence, and it is said that additional permanent guards have been assigned. A uniformed police officer is stationed behind the residence. A Western detective stands guard outside the iron gate, while a guard with a loaded rifle and bayonet stands inside the gate.</p>
<p>Threats Stem from Rumors</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, has received threats of a serious nature. Therefore, extra military and police personnel are stationed at various points, including the Ambassador's residence at No. 50 Yu Yuen Road and the British Embassy office at No. 27 The Bund, to provide protection. The exact nature of the threat has not been disclosed. However, an embassy official told a reporter last night (12th) that the threats against the British Ambassador were not conveyed through letters, but rather through rumors circulating in the outside world.</p>
<p>Police Investigating</p>
<p>It is said that the Ambassador received notification of the threat towards the end of last week. The police received a report and immediately took precautions. Both the British Embassy and the police department are taking the matter seriously and taking all possible measures. On Saturday and Sunday nights, additional police officers and a squad of British soldiers from the West Yorkshire Regiment were stationed at the Ambassador's residence. Yesterday morning, patrolmen were also stationed inside the British Embassy building on the Bund. Western detectives from the Jing'an Temple police station also assisted in protecting the Ambassador during his commutes between his residence and office. According to officials at the British Embassy and the police department, all threats, whether from fantasists, pranksters, or those with genuine malicious intent, will be investigated. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr had no choice but to take strict precautions after receiving the threats.</p>
<h3>After Shortage of Copper Subsidiary Coins in Shanghai, Proper Remedial Measures Are Being Planned; Permission to Issue Small Denomination Notes for Circulation; Postage Stamps Used as a Temporary Measure</h3>
<p>Due to unscrupulous merchants collecting old copper coins and coppers in the Shanghai market for profit, a serious shortage has occurred. In addition to using postage stamps and revenue stamps as substitutes, businesses have also requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to quickly plan remedial measures. At the same time, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has also reported to its head office. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Central Bank Reports Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Life News learned from relevant sources that, in addition to using postage stamps and revenue stamps as substitutes for copper coins, businesses have also requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to quickly plan remedial measures. At the same time, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has also reported the causes and course of the copper coin shortage in Shanghai to its head office, which has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for consideration. It is said that the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Director of the Currency Department to study and consider remedial measures. It is considered inappropriate to continue transporting new copper coins minted by various mints in other locations to Shanghai to alleviate the situation, because if large quantities are transported to Shanghai again, unscrupulous merchants will inevitably collect and smuggle them out again. Furthermore, the price of copper overseas is soaring, and certain military arms merchants are in great need. As for the issue of issuing small denomination notes, it is considered feasible and a solution will be found in the near future.</p>
<p>Hope for Swift Decision from Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was widely rumored that the nickel content in nickel coins is limited, and the copper content in one-cent copper coins is also negligible. The rumor that someone is purchasing them at high prices is considered unbelievable. The current shortage of copper and nickel coins is caused by unscrupulous merchants hoarding them for speculation. Therefore, leaders in the silver and money industry have jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, suggesting that a large quantity of subsidiary coins be quickly transported to Shanghai to alleviate the situation. A reporter from the New New News inquired with the silver and money industry about this, but was unable to confirm it. However, according to bankers, hoarding by unscrupulous merchants is one of the causes of the copper coin shortage. The fact that 50 million copper coins are exported annually is difficult to argue against. However, all sectors sincerely hope that the Ministry of Finance will quickly plan remedial measures. They are particularly eager for the Ministry of Finance to issue one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent copper coin notes, because continuing to transport copper and nickel subsidiary coins to Shanghai will inevitably lead to them being absorbed by unscrupulous merchants and smuggled out again. Although the copper coin shortage and panic may be temporarily alleviated, the panic will inevitably recur. Therefore, it is hoped that the financial authorities will carefully consider and make a swift decision to relieve the suffering of the five million citizens of Shanghai caused by the copper coin shortage as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Must Be Cautious Issuing Substitute Vouchers</p>
<p>Because of the shortage of copper coins, businesses have been forced to use postage stamps or revenue stamps for small transactions, causing postage stamps to become the current common medium of exchange. The minimum transaction is now one cent, causing an invisible increase in prices. Goods that previously sold for one or two copper coins now cost one cent. However, cooked water vendors use self-made bamboo tallies for transactions. In addition to reissuing previously collected tokens to facilitate making change, the public transportation company has also jointly announced with the tram company: "Due to the extreme shortage of copper coins and five-cent nickel coins in the market, passengers are requested to pay the exact fare to avoid difficulty in making change. This is hereby announced for your information." It is said that the first to issue substitute vouchers were member stores of the 37th District Branch of the Shanghai United Association on North Fujian Road, issuing one-cent and two-cent denominations. Now, the 16th District Branch of the Shanghai United Association on New Zha Road will also convene its member stores at 4:00 PM today to discuss the issuance of substitute vouchers. However, according to a reporter from the New New News, although issuing substitute vouchers for use by stores to alleviate the current difficulties may gain some sympathy, it is generally inappropriate. This is because such vouchers have no specified reserve funds and no supervisory body, which not only causes many abuses but also involves the suspicion of privately issuing banknotes. It is hoped that all stores will carefully consider this and avoid future troubles.</p>
<p>Difficult to Ban Due to Lack of Authority</p>
<p>The Central Mint's Shanghai factory minted a total of 927,658,320 one-cent copper coins until it ceased operations at the end of July of the year before last. All of these were successively issued by the Central Bank for circulation in Shanghai. Now, unscrupulous merchants are collecting them for profit and smuggling them out of Shanghai to supply a certain party for use as military equipment. It is said that a profit of two dimes can be made for every 100 copper coins. As for copper coins with inscriptions of Guangxu and Great Qing, their coin quality is even better, so the profits are even greater. Although the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued notices banning and investigating, the central government's authority does not extend to Shanghai, which is located in the occupied area. Therefore, the Central Bank has decided to stop supplying Shanghai with copper coins.</p>
<p>Pudong is Preparing Another Anti-British Parade</p>
<p>Regarding the Lun Chang Factory incident in Pudong, the pro-Japanese New Shen Bao newspaper reported yesterday that the company's management, through its British General Manager Sinclair, has entrusted the Japanese to mediate the labor dispute and has been introduced by the Japanese to meet with the puppet "municipal government" to ease the external atmosphere. On the one hand, they are preparing a large-scale anti-British parade in Pudong, scheduled to take place this Thursday. At that time, ignorant workers from Lun Chang will still be forced to participate. It is said that the parade route will be much longer than before and will also demonstrate at the old Lun Chang factory in Bailianjing. This shows that the previous propaganda was merely a disguise for the puppet regime's anti-British activities, so that the instigation of the anti-British parade will be entirely attributed to the workers at the time.</p>
<p>Civilian Boat From Shanghai to Huzhou Seized Without a Trace</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Huzhou route has only recently resumed traffic. According to sources in the inland waterway transport industry yesterday, a civilian boat sailing from Shanghai a few days ago was suddenly attacked and detained near Bachichi, and its whereabouts are unknown. The ship was carrying a large quantity of goods, resulting in significant losses. Currently, water and land routes in western Zhejiang are experiencing difficulties due to the unstable situation, and traffic has completely stopped.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ship Violates Orders, Should Be Subject to Suspension of Navigation; De Ping Ship Fails to Comply with Defense Command Orders; Ningbo Authorities Grant Lenient Punishment, Detention for Ten Days</h3>
<p>Da Guang News Agency reports that the Italian ship "De Ping" of the Sino-Italian Shipping Company encountered nine air raids on Ningbo on the 3rd. The ship failed to undergo inspection by military and police authorities before leaving Lower Baisha River for Shanghai, which the Ningbo Defense Command considered a violation of orders. After the ship sailed to Ningbo again on the morning of the 9th, it was detained for ten days. It is currently detained in Ningbo and must wait until the detention period expires before it can load cargo and return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Another Version of the Reason for Detention</p>
<p>The New Life News Agency reports that the Ningbo and Wenzhou Defense Commanders, in order to facilitate cargo transportation, have specifically approved navigation between Ningbo and Wenzhou. However, it is stipulated that ships entering Ningbo are limited to carrying goods such as food rice. Now, the Italian ship "De Ping" of the Sino-Italian Company loaded cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Ningbo. Local authorities gave the order to suspend navigation because the ship was not loaded with rice. After the company repeatedly requested leniency, it finally obtained the understanding of the authorities, and the ship was given the punishment of suspending one voyage. It is currently scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo the day after tomorrow. As for the German ship "Harna" of the German Far East Company on the Shanghai-Dinghai line, it arrived in Shanghai from Dinghai yesterday morning. It is allowed to continue sailing to Dinghai at 4:00 AM this morning. However, according to the orders of the authorities, passengers are absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>Ningbo Passengers Prevented from Entering Dinghai</p>
<p>After the Ningbo Defense Command was ordered to approve the restoration of the Shanghai-Ningbo route, all the original ships resumed sailing one after another. However, the authorities only allowed the transportation of cargo and absolutely prohibited passengers, causing inconvenience to people traveling back and forth between Shanghai and Ningbo. After the German ship "Harna" resumed sailing to Dinghai on the 5th, many passengers who wanted to come to Shanghai from Ningbo first took the Gaodeng ship to Dinghai to wait for the ship so that they could transfer to Shanghai. However, the Dinghai authorities, in accordance with orders prohibiting all ships from carrying passengers, absolutely prohibited it from carrying passengers when "Harna" set sail. Even after lobbying, it was not approved. Therefore, about 300 passengers from Ningbo were all blocked, and the situation was extremely embarrassing. It is said that "Harna" returned to Shanghai from Dinghai yesterday morning and will still sail to Dinghai at 4:00 PM today. It is said that this time it has been approved to carry passengers from Dinghai.</p>
<p>Absolutely Prohibit Passengers on All Ships</p>
<p>Furthermore, the German ship "Moufu" of the German Reiff, Holzhauer &amp; Co. arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday morning and set sail for Ningbo at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. As for the British ship "New Beijing" of the British Swire Shipping which remained in Ningbo, it returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and arrived at the wharf of the company on the Bund in the French Concession at 6:30 PM yesterday. It is unloading cargo starting this morning. However, all ships are limited to carrying cargo and are absolutely prohibited from carrying passengers.</p>
<h3>Reiterate Previous Order Banning Silver Coins; Consolidate Legal Tender Credit; Should Exchange for Legal Tender at the Four Banks to Use; Actively Collect by Establishing More Collection Agencies</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance (Yu) Qian Zi No. 3798 Circular to All Provincial Governments states: This Ministry's Second Phase of Wartime Administrative Plan Implementation Specific Plan and Phased Progress Table has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and transfer to the National Defense Supreme Committee for review. The financial matters in this plan, (1) consolidate the credit of legal tender, (2) collect gold and silver, state that remote areas in our country such as Mongolia, Tibet, Qinghai, and Ningxia still use silver coins. Their use should be strictly prohibited, and they should be actively collected. The Ministry of Finance has already telegraphed the military and political leaders of each area to issue a new announcement banning the use of hard currency and to instruct the gold and silver exchange offices of the four banks to establish more agencies to actively collect them, with the goal of completing the order to ban the use of hard currency in the shortest possible time and increase the amount of silver collected. The table notes that banning the use of hard currency has been continuously handled from the first to the eighth phase. The Ministry has repeatedly requested that all provincial governments inform their subordinates to announce and make it widely known. We should reiterate the previous order and strictly prohibit this. In addition to sending a separate circular, we also request that the head office of the joint office of the four banks instruct the gold and silver exchange offices to plan to increase the number of collection agencies. Accordingly, the government of your province is requested to examine this, instruct your subordinates to announce it, strictly prohibit the use of silver coins, and if users of silver coins are found, they should be immediately guided to send them to the nearby branches of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, or their entrusted exchange agencies, to exchange for legal tender for use, and the handling situation should be reported to the Ministry for review.</p>
<p>North Xin Jing Advanced Curfew Time</p>
<p>The North Xin Jing ferry crossing is an important inland waterway. Due to the unstable situation in western Shanghai in recent days, precautions have been stepped up. In addition to the ferry from the concession to North Xin Jing being suspended and not yet restored, the curfew has been advanced. After 6:00 PM every day, all ships and pedestrians are prohibited from traveling. Recently, the number of routes to Suzhou and Wuxi has been reduced, and ships arriving in Shanghai have also departed earlier to avoid accidents.</p>
<h3>One Type of Economic Aggression; Japanese Plan to Control Cotton Production; Established the So-Called "Cotton Production Promotion Association"; Established Experimental Fields in Nanjing and Dachang</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese launched their war of aggression against China, they have been actively seizing resources in various occupied areas and using puppet organizations, under the guise of cooperation and promotion, to organize various industrial and commercial organizations, such as the "Central China Company," in order to control various industries in Central China. They have been particularly active in the cotton production sector. The Japanese previously initiated the establishment of the "Cotton Production Promotion Association." Recently, the association has expanded its organization and increased its capital to 300,000 yuan, with China and Japan each bearing half. The "President" is Liang Hongzhi, the "President of the Executive Yuan" who was recently poisoned in Nanjing. The "Chairman" is Wang Zihui, and the "Vice Chairmen" are Shen Nengyi and Kosera. However, the actual power is in the hands of the Japanese, and the Chinese are only used as pawns. It is now said that cotton seed experimental fields have been established in Dachang in this city and near Zhongshan Gate in Nanjing, with Japanese personnel Bonara and Ikeda serving as technicians. Cotton planting will begin soon.</p>

<h3>If Japan Attempts to Seize Concessions, It Will Lead to Tragic Consequences; New York Times Far East Manager So Tam; Shanghai Watches Tianjin Situation; Japanese Residents South of Suzhou Creek Will Move North</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that Mr. Abender, the Far East Manager of the New York Times, recently took a short trip to Japan with friends and then returned to the United States. Mr. Abender has been in China for thirteen years and this is his first leave of absence in five years to return to his country. During his trip to Japan, he stated to guests that it is difficult to expect the Third Power countries to accept Japan's request to reform the Shanghai International Settlement immediately, because this matter is very complicated and must be resolved gradually. According to Mr. Abender, reforming the municipal administration of the International Settlement involves many things. This kind of event cannot be resolved quickly at this time. Hasty actions would only disrupt the settlement and be of no benefit. It is difficult to expect related countries to accept Japan's recent request to reform the administrative structure of the concession immediately. If Japan occupies the concession by force, the tragic consequences will be unimaginable, because terrorists may take the opportunity to act and frame Japan in order to put Japan in a difficult position.</p>
<p>The Current Situation is Very Peaceful</p>
<p>The current situation in the concession is very peaceful, because the Shanghai Municipal Council officials are taking strict precautions and expelling all Chinese suspected of terrorism from the concession, so the peace and order in the concession can be well maintained. Mr. Abender also mentioned the current Sino-Japanese war, saying that the war will last a long time, and no one can know when it will end, because the military and financial strength of both sides is unknown to the outside world, so it is difficult to make predictions.</p>
<p>Solve the Outstanding Cases, We Should Seek Patience</p>
<p>However, if Japan wants to end the Chinese incident as soon as possible, sending another 150,000 troops to China to leave no room for guerrillas to operate is absolutely necessary. The Chinese army is not very afraid of Japanese air raids now, and China has not built a large arsenal that is worth bombing. China prevents bombing, so the arsenals that have been built are small in scale and scattered throughout various places. The value of each one does not exceed one thousand pounds. Mr. Abender did not say that although there are many outstanding cases between the Japanese authorities and the foreign authorities in China that need to be resolved, the surface is still friendly. Japan should be patient in resolving many problems. The Japanese authorities already know this.</p>
<p>The Ding Case is Not Over, The Violence Is Increasing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reports that the violence between the Japanese army and navy authorities in China has increased and has led to the death of Ding Geller in Shanghai. Now it leads to taking special precautions to protect the life of British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. Since Saturday, the British soldiers of the West Yorkshire Regiment and the patrolmen stationed at the Ambassador's residence at No. 50 Yu Yuen Road have more than doubled. The Ambassador is protected by agents wearing steel mesh vests on both sides when traveling by car. This is all the result of Japanese threats.</p>
<p>Lun Chang Workers Prevented from Entering the Factory</p>
<p>After the Japanese party instigated a strike at the Lun Chang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, Ding Geller was killed in a tragic death. When the instigators accompanied the workers who wanted to return to work and forced their way into the factory, they were all arrested. However, the instigators managed to escape their Japanese protection and went straight to the power room, trying to damage it. Mr. Ding fired a shot there, trying to scare off the instigators who the Japanese soldiers were not managing, and became the target of the Japanese soldiers' attention. They took his gun and stabbed him with a bayonet. In the past few days, armed groups have fired guns at the Lun Chang printing factory in Bailianjing to scare off workers from returning to the factory. In addition to hiring this single armed group, the Japanese party has also posted many anti-British and anti-foreign leaflets in Pudong.</p>
<p>This City is Concerned About the Tianjin Situation; Shanghai is also deeply concerned about the Tianjin situation in addition to paying attention to the situation in this city. Although the Japanese army there has clearly stated that it will take care of the interests of third countries, it seems to have prepared to block the British and French concessions tomorrow (14th). Sources in this city said that Japanese residents living in the International Settlement or the French Concession south of the Suzhou Creek have been ordered to move to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, and those who violate the order will be punished by revoking their passports. This move is similar to the relocation of the British and French concessions in Tianjin. Looking at the Japanese business houses on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek that own their own houses, from the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund to the yarn factories in the Yichang Road area, this move is quite serious. Even Japanese women who cohabit with foreigners on the south bank have also received orders to move to the north bank.</p>
<p>French Park Brass Band Concert</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold a brass band concert at the French Park from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM on the 14th of this month (weather permitting). The program includes seven items.</p>
<h3>工部局's Control of Commodity Prices: No Immediate Trend, But Intervention Planned When Key Items Reach "Famine Point"</h3>
<p>Spokesperson's Informal Remarks</p>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that prices in Shanghai continue to rise to unprecedented levels, with food prices generally increasing by about 30%. Yesterday, an 工部局 spokesperson informally told reporters that the 工部局 would only use special powers to control rising prices when essential items like rice reach a "famine point." This is particularly relevant to the Chinese population. The 工部局 did not make a formal statement yesterday, and the board meeting scheduled for 4:30 PM today (the 13th) is not expected to discuss this matter.</p>
<p>This Situation Cannot Last. Well-informed sources believe that, regardless of the legal tender, this situation is temporary. Supply and demand will adjust the situation. If someone raises prices for profit, others will set lower prices to attract customers. Many believe that if rice prices soar, creating a rice famine, the 工部局 will follow the precedent of the 1937 rice shortage after the start of the war and import rice to sell at regulated, reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Difficult to Suppress Observed Phenomena. Western medicines have also increased in price. According to Bayer Pharmaceuticals, their drugs have increased by about 30%. Other items, such as rubber goods, rental cars, and imported cigarettes, have also increased in price. Although beer prices remain the same, observations suggest that a price increase is inevitable in the near future.</p>
<p>Prosperity in Consumption Unlikely to Last. According to a financier, the current prosperity in Shanghai is only in terms of consumption and is unlikely to last. The reasons are that those who came to Shanghai to escape the war will gradually run out of funds and be unable to continue. Recently, exchange rates have tightened again, and all commodity prices have risen. The decline in citizens' purchasing power is very evident. Since the exchange rate tightened, foreign goods have increased in price, and goods directly or indirectly related to foreign goods have also increased, such as gasoline, kerosene, hardware, coal, rental cars, paper, piece goods, leather, enamelware, steel, paint, screws, and other daily necessities, all without exception. Recently, the lack of copper-nickel subsidiary coins has made it difficult to make change, and unscrupulous merchants are taking advantage of this to convert small amounts into whole numbers, effectively raising prices by taking advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>Advocating Domestic Goods During Extraordinary Times. During these extraordinary times, various commodity prices have already risen compared to pre-war levels due to traffic congestion, supply and demand imbalances, and speculation. However, the increase in foreign goods prices is welcomed because it greatly benefits the sales of domestic goods. However, domestic manufacturers should not take the opportunity to raise prices, giving the public a bad impression. In the midst of these price increases, those with savings can cope, but ordinary wage earners and laborers already find it difficult to make a living and are constantly complaining.</p>
<p>Captured Portuguese Ships Transferred to Japanese Merchants: Unconfirmed</p>
<p>Portuguese Consulate Still Negotiating</p>
<p>More than ten Portuguese merchant ships, including "Meda," "Tombay," "Tonglu," "Tongqiao," "Hailong," and "Marie," have been detained by Japanese warships for two months. Despite repeated negotiations by the Portuguese Consulate with the Japanese side, there have been no results. It is rumored that the Japanese side has transferred ownership of the ships to Nisshin Kisen Kaisha to compensate for war losses. However, reporters from the "New News Agency" learned from the shipping companies that they have not received the above report. The Portuguese Consulate is continuing to negotiate with the Japanese side to safeguard its legitimate shipping rights in China.</p>
<p>Fifty Scout Groups:</p>
<p>Xu Zhengxiang's Martyrdom</p>
<p>Passed Away in Guilin</p>
<p>The 50th Scout Group of this city has served in the war zone with remarkable results. Yesterday, a report was received that Xu Zhengxiang, a member of the group, who was working on first aid transport for the Red Cross, passed away due to exhaustion from running around, contracting typhoid fever, which was not cured at the Guilin Provincial Hospital. He died at 6:05 PM on the 9th of this month. Xu was originally employed by the Waterworks Company, from Ningbo, 23 years old, married, and without children, but with parents still living. After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, he voluntarily filled out a pledge, vowing to serve the country at the cost of his life. His dedication leading to his death is deeply mourned.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructions: Trademark Registration Procedures</p>
<p>Since the relevant industrial and commercial authorities in Shanghai have temporarily suspended operations, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to clarify the procedures for applying for trademark registration for the general industrial and commercial community, and to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests, has published six trademark registration procedures based on current laws and implementing regulations in the Chamber's monthly commercial publication. It also includes samples of trademark exclusive right application forms, types A, B, and C, where type A is for applications where the mark has not been previously used, and type B is for marks that have already been used. The recently revised Trademark Law Implementing Rules, totaling forty articles, are also published in full in the publication.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General's Residence in Nanjing: Japanese Judge Dies of Poisoning; Two Cooks Flee After Being Poisoned</h3>
<p>Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, Gao Guanwu, and other key figures of the puppet "Reformed Government," in order to ingratiate themselves with the Japanese side, held a banquet at the Japanese Consul General's residence in Nanjing on the evening of the 9th to welcome Kiyomizu Ruzaburo, a Foreign Ministry official from Japan. They took their seats at 7:00 PM. Just as they toasted with Shaoxing wine, the attendees showed signs of poisoning. Liang Hongzhi, the "President of the Executive Yuan," and Gao Guanwu, the "Mayor of Nanjing," were deeply affected by the poison. It is said that their lives are in danger. Among them, Miya Scorpionda and Fernan Yama (both transliterated), two young judges from the Japanese Consulate, were particularly severely poisoned, according to foreign sources. They died the next day (Saturday, the 10th). According to a Japanese newspaper report, two cooks from the Japanese Consulate in Nanjing fled without a trace after being poisoned.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Tightening: Japan Expresses Unease; Japanese Shops Affected Most Severely; Ministry of Finance Plans Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, December 12: The Asahi Shimbun recently published an article discussing the Sino-British Stabilization Fund Committee's sudden cessation of support for the legal tender on June 7th. It stated that Japan may retaliate against Britain's recent change in its "exchange rate policy in China." The Committee's move is particularly harmful to the business of Japanese shops in Shanghai. It is difficult to determine whether the cessation of support for the legal tender is due to the exhaustion of the Stabilization Fund or is a politically motivated attempt to harm Japan's economic policy in China. The Japanese Ministry of Finance is closely monitoring developments and is seriously considering countermeasures to deal with the situation. (Report from Hong Kong on the 13th of this newspaper) The closing price of legal tender for Hong Kong dollars on the evening of the 13th was 43.</p>
<p>Lu Ruiwu Suffers Loss and Grief: Donates Compensation to Relief Efforts</p>
<p>All Compensation After Retirement Dedicated to Social Welfare to Support Charitable Causes.</p>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Citizens' Group received a letter from Mr. Lu Ruiwu, which stated: "Unfortunately, East Asia has been devastated by war, the land suffers from devastation and shame, and the people suffer from displacement and hardship. Thanks to the help of colleagues, the masses of the helpless are supported, and you, gentlemen of the Association, have been wholeheartedly planning for the well-being of society, which I greatly admire. Regrettably, I have been burdened by work and have not fulfilled my responsibilities. Recently, my hometown has been unstable, and I have brought my family to Shanghai to seek refuge. Unexpectedly, last month, my young son was killed by a car. Having survived a close call, my heart was still chilled when misfortune struck my family, and I suffered loss and grief. After much consideration, I respectfully dedicate the 500 yuan received as compensation for the accident to society for charitable purposes. I am specially sending 200 yuan to the Association, along with this letter, and I hope that you will check and receive it. This is to fulfill the kindness of heaven and to help the refugees. This mark of sorrow is also for commemoration. Please do not regard it as generosity at another's expense. I respectfully wish you all the best."</p>

<h3>Deeply in Love with a Dancer: Fraudulently Obtaining US Dollars Continues; Chen Lingmei Consults Lawyer Yao to Woo Dancer; Yao, Due to Financial Difficulties, Conspires to Defraud a Large Sum; Complex and Bizarre Case Involving Many Relationships</h3>
<p>Chen Lingmei, a retired employee of a bank, and Yao Ruilian, a lawyer, allegedly conspired on November 19th of last year to defraud the Baotai Bank on Sichuan Road of US$1,500. The case was discovered, and Chief Inspector Jiang Shangpei of the General Police Station's Chinese Detective Division arrested Chen and Yao, along with Chen's mistress, Shen Lili, a former dancer at the Dalu Dance Hall, as well as Zhang Zhaohan, Liu Kangsun, and three others, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Judge Meng Tingke specially convened a criminal trial in the Fourth Court to hear the case. Peng Xuehai, a lawyer hired by the Baotai Bank, appeared in court to bring a civil suit, requesting that the defendants be jointly and severally ordered to repay US$1,500. The defendant Yao Ruilian hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the police station, presented the case, stating that during the adjournment, it was discovered that the defendant Yao Ruilian had a person named Zheng Shunsheng residing at No. 37 Tongshou Lane on Datong Road, who had pledged a savings passbook of 5,300 yuan from the Kenyie Bank to Yao's Yong'an Bank for a loan of 1,500 yuan. When the term expired, Yao withdrew the deposit and used it privately. Although Zheng reported it to the police station at the time, because Yao's lawyer's office had persuaded Zheng, Zheng stated that he was unwilling to pursue the matter, so the police station did not add the case. Chen Lingmei, the defendant, previously worked at a bank. Chen danced at the Dalu Dance Hall (now known as Weigong), where he met the dancer Shen Lili (the second defendant). Over time, they fell in love and became engaged, but because Chen's family still had various problems, he consulted lawyer Yao Ruilian for assistance. At that time, Yao had established the Yong'an Bank in the Hadong Building, but due to a shortage of funds, she asked Chen for help and conspired a plan to defraud money. First, Chen instructed Zhang Zhaohan to rent houses at No. 308 Pushi Road and No. 19 Xilong, Jianye Lane, Fulvli Road, where Chen and Shen Lili resided separately. On November 18th of last year, room 273 of the Shanghai New Hotel on Jiujiang Road was booked. Yao Ruilian used 190 yuan in legal tender to purchase two remittance tickets from the Huitong Bank and the Yikang Money Shop, each for 100 yuan, and exchanged two remittance slips from the Guohua Bank. One slip was altered to 10,000 yuan, and the other was not used because the writing was damaged. They were handed over to Chen. The next day, the 19th, Yao went to a certain place to meet with Chen, saying that today, no matter what, the plan must be implemented. She instructed Chen to use the altered ticket as a decoy and not to sell it. Chen was forced to ask his colleague to call the Baotai Money Shop, instructing them to send US$1,500, and also called the Changtai Money Shop, instructing them to send JP¥1,500. After the call, the Changtai Money Shop first ordered its staff to send JP¥ to a certain bank, but because Changtai did not want to accept the remittance slip, the transaction did not go through. Soon, Zhang Yu and two other staff members sent US$ to the meeting place. Chen's colleague instructed them to contact Chen Lingmei. Chen instructed the staff to wait in the reception room, then took the money into the room. Unexpectedly, he escaped through the side door and went to the Shanghai Hotel, where he exchanged US$200 for 1,241 yuan in cash. He then withdrew 500 yuan and gave it to Zhang Zhaohan, who forwarded it to his mother. At that time, Yao Ruilian had also arrived. In addition to giving Yao US$800, Chen entrusted Zhang Zhaohan to keep the remaining funds. Zhang gave 150 yuan in national currency to Shen Lili as expenses. The next day, Yao Ruilian went to Jianye Lane to meet Chen, bringing envelopes and stationery, instructing Chen to write a letter to the Baotai Money Shop. The draft of the letter was written by Yao. On the 21st, Zhang Zhaohan was busy with work and could not handle it alone, so he obtained Chen's consent and introduced the defendant Liu Kangsun to help. From then on, Liu went to Chen's house every day. Later, every time Lawyer Yao went to Chen's house, Chen always asked Yao to resolve the matter as soon as possible. Yao kept making promises until the night of November 29th, when Yao used a 600-yuan check from a certain bank from her Yong'an Bank, with a date of December 3rd, to exchange for cash from Chen. Chen again instructed Zhang Zhaohan to exchange US$100 for 500 yuan in national currency and give it to Yao, who issued a receipt. However, the check could not be cashed when it was due. On the 30th of the month, the Baotai Money Shop published a wanted notice for Chen Lingmei. Chen was very anxious when he saw the notice. Fearing that the news would leak out from his residence, he entrusted Liu Kangsun to rent a house at No. 32 Anren Lane, No. 1403 Aivenyi Road. On January 14th of this year, he vacated the houses on Pushi Road and Fulvli Road and moved in with Shen Lili on Aivenyi Road. Yao Ruilian also visited from time to time and showed Chen a savings passbook of over 5,000 yuan from the Kenyie Bank (the one pledged by Zheng Shunsheng), saying that the matter could be resolved and that he did not need to worry. Later, because Yao repeatedly made promises, Chen had a conflict with her, and Yao stopped visiting. The secret of Chen and others was learned by a Mrs. Zhu at No. 10 in the same lane, who took the opportunity to threaten them. Chen had no choice but to invite Yao to come and discuss how to deal with it. As a result, Yao gave Mrs. Zhu 200 yuan in cash and a check for 100 yuan. Although the matter was settled, the check was again returned when it was due. After Mrs. Zhu negotiated, Yao paid 30 yuan to settle the matter. The check has also been cancelled. After Chen Lingmei committed this crime, all the remaining funds, except for his expenses, were used by Yao and Zhang Zhaohan. Therefore, he lived a life of misery, and all his clothes were pawned. The long robe he is wearing today also belongs to Yao Ruilian, and so on. When questioned, Chen Lingmei's testimony was the same as above. Shen Lili and Liu Kangsun both claimed to be unaware of the fraud. Zhang Zhaohan admitted that he did not participate in the fraud, but admitted that Chen gave him the money, and that except for the money he spent on his behalf, the remaining 1,800 yuan had been used by him. When questioned, Yao Ruilian flatly denied any fraudulent behavior, claiming that she knew nothing about the matter. According to the testimony of Sui Jingwen, the second landlord on Aivenyi Road, and the maid Wu Xiangshi, Yao Ruilian did visit Chen frequently. After reviewing the testimony, the court ordered that the case be adjourned until Tuesday afternoon of next week. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Subtenant Demands Rent Increase: Assaults Doctor; The Perpetrators Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>Chen Guanjin, a pediatrician from Shaoxing, 32 years old, rented the main room of the house of Dai Ruhai (34 years old), a Tianjin native, subtenant at No. 15, Lane 285, Bair Road in the French Concession. He practiced medicine there, charging 45 yuan in national currency per month. Recently, Chen's medical practice has flourished, with many patients. Dai Ruhai, the subtenant, demanded that Chen increase the rent by 15 yuan per month, totaling 60 yuan. Chen refused, leading to an argument. At 5:00 PM on the 12th, Dai Ruhai, the subtenant, clashed again, citing Chen's refusal to increase the rent and demanding that Chen move out immediately. Dai then colluded with his family members Dai Zushang, Dai Yingqi, Han Jizhi, and Zhao Suichun to beat Chen, causing injuries. Chen reported to the French police station, who dispatched detectives to arrest the perpetrators. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the French Concession administrative authorities, presented the case, prosecuting them for assault. The plaintiff, Chen Guanjin, the victim, did not arrive because of serious injuries being treated in the hospital. Judge Wu Kechou ordered each of the defendants to provide a shop guarantee of 100 yuan and adjourned the case until the plaintiff recovered from his injuries. However, because the defendants were guests in Shanghai and had no acquaintances to provide shop guarantees, they paid 100 yuan in cash each as a guarantee to be released and await trial.</p>
<h3>Bodyguard of Gambling Den: Convicted and Refuses to Accept Verdict; Appeal Hearing Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Xie Zhiguang, a Chinese detective from the Diswei Road Police Station, Detective Zhao Lianbi, and others, arrested six robbers on Yuyuan Road on March 19th of this year: Xu Yongquan, Zhu Yunlong, Shen Yougen, Chen Haibin, and Jiang Xiangyun. They also found a Mauser pistol, two Browning pistols, and a Mars pistol at Zhu Jiaku's house on Hague Road. Two of the pistols were stolen from the home of Hua Butou Yao Jiagui at No. 339 Daxi Road on February 17th of this year. It was later found that the defendants had committed two robbery cases and one kidnapping case. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. According to Wang Yushan's confession, he was working as a bodyguard for Shao Liangeng, the owner of the Rongsheng Company gambling den in Huxi. The Mauser pistol that was found was given to him by Shao Liangeng. Judge Xiao Peishen sentenced Jiang Xianghong to eight years in prison, and the others, including Xu Shuiquan, to life imprisonment. However, Xu and others refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court president Yu heard the case in an en banc hearing yesterday and ordered that the sentencing be announced on the 16th.</p>
<h3>Youth Dies from Poisoning</h3>
<p>At 12:30 PM yesterday, a traveler who identified himself as "Sang Xing" at Room 222 of the Far Eastern Hotel locked himself in his room and committed suicide by taking poison. The waiter discovered that he was pale and knew something was wrong, so he immediately reported it to the police station. The Zhabei Police Station dispatched Chinese police officer No. 134 to escort him to the hospital, but he died before he could be saved due to the severe poisoning. The youth was about 30 years old and was only wearing shorts. The reason for his suicide was likely due to economic pressure.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Dies Suddenly</h3>
<p>At 9:45 PM last night, Sun Shuping was pulling a rickshaw (No. 6681) when he suddenly collapsed and lost consciousness at the intersection of Henan Road and Sanma Road. Nearby Chinese police officers rushed him to the hospital for treatment, but he died before arriving. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Collapsed House Injures Four</h3>
<p>A house at No. 1, Lane 403, Mintishi Ni Yin Road, in the French Concession, was destroyed by fire two months ago. Recently, the landlord hired a large number of workers to repair it. At around 4:00 PM yesterday, the house suddenly collapsed. Four workers, Yang Heshang (29 years old), Qiu Guiyuan (33 years old), Wang Maoying (16 years old), and Jiang Shunlong (40 years old), were unable to escape and were seriously injured. Samaritans transported the four to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is said that Jiang Shunlong's injuries are serious and his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Murder Caused by Buying Vegetables: Two Culprits Sentenced</h3>
<p>Wang A'gen (26 years old), a Ningbo native who contracted catering services at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, carried a vegetable basket to the Fujian Road vegetable market to buy vegetables on the morning of the 6th of this month. When he arrived at the entrance of the Tongchengji Vegetable Shop at No. 593 on that road, he saw Zhu Hongyuan and Zhao Shiyin from Jiangyin buying amaranth. They could not agree on a price. Because he also needed the vegetables, he took the initiative to raise the price, willing to pay six cents per catty. Zhu and Zhao were very dissatisfied, and a big argument broke out. Unexpectedly, Wang A'gen was punched to death by Zhu Hongyuan. The patrolling Chinese police officers rushed to the scene and arrested Zhu and Zhao. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the two defendants to the First Special Court's First Criminal Court for prosecution and stated that the deceased was found to be obese, but suffered from heart disease. There were no obvious injuries to the skin, the blood vessels in the body were swollen, and the blood vessels exploded after being stimulated, leading to death. Judge Xiao Xiefen held a hearing and sentenced Zhu Hongyuan and Zhao Shizhen to eight months of imprisonment for causing death by injury.</p>
<h3>Extortionists Sentenced</h3>
<p>Youthful gangsters Xu Gongxia, Zhang Liben, Hou Huiqun, Shen Qun, Huang Yiren, and others recently used the name of the Zhongyi Jiuguo Chujian Tuan (Loyal and Righteous Anti-Japanese Eradication Group) to send a letter to Chen Futian, manager of Chen Fuji Transportation Company at No. 17 Guangdong Road, threatening him, claiming that Chen was transporting goods for a certain party and making a lot of profit, and demanding 5,000 yuan in legal tender. They scheduled a meeting to discuss the matter. Chen reported the matter to the Xinzha Police Station, who dispatched detectives Gong Youwei and Wang Rudong to arrest Xu and four others and send them to the First Special Court. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Xiao announced the verdict in the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. Xu Gongxia was sentenced to two years and eight months of imprisonment for attempted joint extortion. Zhang Liben, Hou Huiqun, Shen Qun, and Huang Yiren were sentenced to two years of imprisonment each for attempted joint extortion. The three letters of extortion, one note, and one bullet were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Two Thieves Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>At 4:30 PM on the 28th of last month, Chinese detective Sun Shaokun from the Weihaiwei Road Police Station, along with Western detective Baiteng and Indian police officer No. 244, arrested two thieves, Chen Bingfu and Zhu Bingfu, from Ningbo, on East-West Huade Road. They found two wooden imitation pistols and a roll of lead wire and took them to the police station. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. During the adjournment, it was found that the two defendants had colluded with accomplices to commit armed robbery between April 3rd and 25th of this year, robbing Du Xiaohong at No. 978 East-West Huade Road, Wang Liu at No. 454 on the same road, and Lu Huiyuan at No. 144 Wusong Road, stealing property worth more than 250 yuan. Yesterday morning, the police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin again sent the case to the Third Criminal Court for prosecution and requested punishment. Judge Jiang sentenced Chen Bingfu to six years and Zhu Bingfu to seven years. The imitation pistols, lead wire, and other items were confiscated.</p>
<h3>A Prostitution Den Set Up Inside a Sugar Store: Two Male and Female Offenders Sentenced</h3>
<p>The Quantai Sugar Store at No. 51 Yanghang Street in the French Concession is owned by Yu Xikang from Ningbo. A few days ago, the Anti-Narcotics Department of the French Police Station learned that the store was operating a large-scale prostitution den, so they dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to search the premises. They seized three opium pipes each, a large quantity of opium and opium paste, and arrested Yu's older sister, Zhang Yu, and a store employee, Liu Xingbao, and sent them to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police station stated that Yu Xikang was highly suspected in the case and requested that Liu Xingbao and Zhang Yu be remanded in custody for a further hearing. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the hearing was resumed. Yu Xikang sent someone to the court, claiming that he had gone to another port for business and could not attend the court. Judge Jiang briefly questioned them and sentenced Zhang Yu to three months of imprisonment for knowingly possessing opium paraphernalia, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. Liu Xingbao was fined 180 yuan, which could be commuted to labor service at the rate of two yuan per day. Zhang Yu paid a 260-yuan bond and Liu Xingbao paid a 140-yuan bond to be released pending further hearings.</p>
<h3>A Gang of Thieves Were Not Satisfied With Their Greed and Continued to Extort, Leading to Their Arrest; After Obtaining a Huge Sum of Money Through Robbery, They Sent a Letter of Extortion, Arranging a Time to Receive the Money and Were Caught in One Fell Swoop</h3>
<p>Wu Jiyu, formerly an assistant manager of the Hefeng Salt Company in Tianjin, was a native of Suzhou and resided at No. 10 Tai'an Lane, Baylor Road, in the French Concession of this city. Wu is currently in Hong Kong, and his wife, Wang, and others reside in Shanghai. At 9:00 AM on the 4th of this month, four robbers suddenly broke into Wu's Shanghai residence. Three of them, holding handguns, claimed to be delivering gifts and, showing their guns, forbade anyone to make a sound. They confined Wu's family members and servants to a downstairs room, with one robber watching them. The others went upstairs to rummage through boxes and chests, stealing diamond rings, pearls, clothing, and cash, totaling a value of 3,065 yuan. The search and robbery lasted two hours. Before escaping, the robbers ordered the victim to gather 2,000 yuan in cash within three days and send it to a certain location. After saying this, the robbers fled in a rush. Afterwards, the victim drew up a list of lost items and reported it to the French police, requesting an investigation. On the afternoon of the 7th, at 6:00 PM, Wu's wife, Wang, received another threatening letter from the gang, delivered by the post office, demanding money. On the 9th, the robbers called Wu Wang again, agreeing to meet at the intersection of Route Pichon and Avenue Lafayette to hand over the money. Wu Wang reported this information to the French police. On the day before yesterday, Inspector Li Xianyang, along with detectives Shen Jinshu, Zhang Xiaofa, Jiang Jia, and others, disguised themselves and went to the location specified by the robbers, waiting for them to come and collect the money. The detectives had not been at the location long when they saw a person approaching slowly. The detectives immediately arrested him. He confessed that his name was Wang Zhizheng (38 years old, from Taizhou). He also said that there were accomplices at No. 209, Liang'an Apartment, No. 109, behind the Grosse Road (now South Soochow Road) police station. The detectives immediately took Wang to Liang'an Apartment to arrest the gang. However, the gang had already become aware of the situation and jumped out of the window to flee. The detectives chased them to the intersection of Woosung Road and Woosung Creek, arresting the gang member Zhu Zhicheng (29 years old, from Changzhou). They then chased them to the intersection of Woosung Road and Avenue Frelupt, arresting Ma Yuzhen (34 years old, from Tianjin) and Cai Xiaozheng (27 years old, from Yixing). They were taken to the police station, where they confessed that the handguns were hidden in the home of Wang Xie (37 years old, from Shaoxing) at No. 9 Xinmin Lane, Route Amiral Bayle. The detectives then went to Wang Xie's home and arrested Wang Xie and Wang Yankang (34 years old, from Suzhou). A search revealed no handguns, only a stack of wooden boards used to hide the guns (more than a dozen boards stacked together with a hollow space in the middle for hiding the guns). Furthermore, the arrested Cai Xiaozheng confessed that Liu Bingyao (22 years old, from Suzhou, the nephew of the victim Wu Jiyu's brother) had provided the information for the case involving Wu Wang's home. Liu was hiding in Room 43 of the Southeast Hotel on Rue Brenier de Montmorand. The detectives then worked with the Xinzha police station to dispatch detectives to the Southeast Hotel on Rue Brenier de Montmorand and arrested Liu Bingyao. They were taken back to the police station. In total, seven male and female criminals were arrested. The details have already been briefly reported in the newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent the criminals to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. Judge Miao Qingbang took the bench for questioning. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer for the French Concession authorities, stated the case, saying that the defendants were arrested for robbery and extortion, and the police had not yet completed the investigation. He requested that the defendants be detained and the case be adjourned for further investigation. The court verified the report, asked the defendants their names, ages, and hometowns, and ordered that the case be adjourned until June 27. The defendants were taken into custody.</p>

<h3>Counterfeit Money Offenders Apprehended, Brought to Court for Questioning Yesterday; Main Culprit Yao Huaiqing Still at Large</h3>
<p>Gao Huixian, a Chinese detective for the Gordon Road police station, learned on the afternoon of the day before yesterday that someone was selling counterfeit banknotes for profit at Room 13 of the Huxi Hotel, No. 12, Lane 229, Avenue du Roi Albert. He disguised himself as a guest and went to Room 13 of the hotel, where he apprehended Liu Jinkui, a native of Shandong (56 years old). He seized a total of 100 yuan in counterfeit banknotes, including one-yuan and five-yuan denominations from the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. After questioning, he learned that</p>
<p>these counterfeit banknotes</p>
<p>were purchased from Ding Zhanwei, a fellow villager residing at No. 319, Columbia Road, Fahua Town. Detective Gao, along with the criminal Liu, went to that location and arrested Ding. Ding confessed that a large amount of counterfeit money was hidden in the home of Yang Zijian, a native of Zhenjiang, at No. 15, Yongyu Lane, Route Amiral Bayle, in the French Concession. They then went to that address and, together with French police officers, arrested Yang. They seized counterfeit currency from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, totaling</p>
<p>7,100</p>
<p>yuan. Liu, Ding, and Yang, along with a small suitcase of counterfeit money, were taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Zhang Tianyin, a police lawyer, explained the case, stating that the investigation revealed that the main culprit was Yao Huaiqing, a native of Nanjing (formerly a printer), and Ding Zhanwei's wife, Wang Guiying, were still at large. The three defendants in this case had previously committed</p>
<p>the same crime</p>
<p>and served prison sentences. He requested an extension of the investigation. A portion of the counterfeit money from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications was presented for inspection. Detective Gao then reported the details of the case's investigation. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the three criminals, Liu, Ding, and Yang, and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further review in seven days.</p>

<p>The Unique Features of Ford and Mercury Automobiles</p>
<p>Since its inception, the Ford Motor Company has produced many excellent vehicles. Among them, the 1939 Ford and Mercury automobiles should be considered the best. The Mercury's engine outwardly resembles the 85-horsepower engine, but it is not. It is capable of producing ten more horsepower, and its weight is only seven pounds more than the 85-horsepower engine. Moreover, all Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln Zephyr automobiles use baked enamel paint, which is durable and long-lasting. The Ford V8 has a ventilated V-shaped windshield that other cars do not have, providing clear visibility. In addition, the interior and exterior of the car doors are equipped with curved handles. The top of the front seat backrest is fitted with soft padding. In the event of an unfortunate car accident, passengers in the rear seat are protected from injury. The car is also equipped with foot-controlled headlight dimming for convenient use while driving. Furthermore, this year's Ford, Mercury, and Lincoln Zephyr automobiles are specially equipped with door latches. This simple device allows the doors to open wide for easy entry and exit. All of these features ensure safety.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Announces: Infectious Diseases Are Rampant</p>

<p>Ample Supplies of Firewood and Charcoal: No Need to Worry About Fuel Shortages</p>
<p>The city's fuel supply mainly consists of coal balls, white coal, firewood, and charcoal. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the source of domestic coal has been cut off, and the city relies entirely on coal shipments from India and other places. Due to the recent tightening of foreign exchange, the prices of white coal and coal balls have both risen as a result. However, the price of firewood and charcoal has fallen slightly compared to before, as large quantities have been shipped from Wenzhou in recent days. As the city has sufficient supplies and smooth supply routes, there is no cause for panic regarding fuel.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We are instructed by our clients Chen Bingwen and Sun Shiqi to state that we have read an item in the local news section of your newspaper dated June 12, regarding Chen Bingwen and Sun Shiqi allegedly abducting a woman from a respectable family. This is completely inconsistent with the facts, and we are specially commissioned by our lawyers to write to your newspaper office requesting a correction to set the record straight. The circumstances at the time were as follows: Chen Bingwen and Ms. Wei Wenxiu had known each other for several years as neighbors and friends. Chen Bingwen fled to the countryside after the Shanghai Incident and only recently returned to Shanghai. He met Wei Wenxiu and, due to important matters, went to the Kaiwuling Apartments, accompanied by his friend Sun Shiqi, to discuss them. That day, French Concession police were searching rooms there, and they were suspected, which led to their wrongful arrest and being taken to the police station. After investigation by the police station, it was found that Chen Bingwen and Sun Shiqi had no criminal behavior or evidence, so they were released immediately as law-abiding citizens. This is completely inconsistent with the facts reported in your newspaper. Fearing that the outside world would not know the truth and misunderstand, we have specially written to your newspaper requesting an immediate correction. We remain, Shen Bao Guan Zhong Bi Xiansheng Taijian (Respectfully yours, Mr. Editor of the Shen Bao), Representative Lawyer Xi Xiangguan, June 13.</p>
<p>To the Editor: We are instructed by our client Mr. Qu Songqing to state that we have seen in the new column of your newspaper dated the 12th of this month an article regarding Han Funan, Liu Wuzhai, and myself being involved in a boat rental lawsuit. This is very inconsistent with the facts. Han Funan's boat could not be towed out after the 813 Incident because it was moored near the battlefield of Tianshenggang. After repeated requests, the Shanghai Ship Transport Company was asked to find a way. They agreed to help as a favor and made an introduction. Subsequently, Shan Han Funan and his boat's captain Cai Juming accompanied the Japanese from the Shanghai Ship Transport Company to Tianshenggang several times before the boat was towed out. Afterwards, the boat joined the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company as a share, which was also entirely negotiated by Han Funan with the Shanghai Steamship Company and had nothing to do with me. Therefore, the wages of the boat's crew and the oil and yarn used on the boat should be borne by the boat owner and were also changed to be supplied by the Shanghai Steamship Company. This is undeniable, so how could it be arbitrarily implicated and mistakenly believed that I was involved? Fortunately, the facts are all there and will be revealed. The boat rental incident involving Han Funan and Liu Wuzhai was originally for other purposes. At that time, I was only acting as a guarantor for Liu Wuzhai due to our friendship. How could it be that I conspired to continue the lease? Moreover, the boat had already been legally returned to the Shanghai Pier and properly handed over before July 17 last year, with various evidences to be checked. The first instance ruled that Han Funan's boat had already been recovered and should not have filed a lawsuit. Therefore, the verdict was a loss. Although the lawsuit continues, the truth will eventually come to light. It is easy to understand who is right and who is wrong in this matter. The reports in the newspaper are inaccurate, and because they affect my reputation, I cannot remain silent. I request that your lawyer write a letter of correction. Respectfully, Lawyer Tang Ying, June 13.</p>
<p>Yesterday, your newspaper reported that the date of our Association's burning offering ceremony was the 15th, which was mistaken for the 16th. The initiation ceremony on the 16th (April 28th of the lunar calendar) was mistaken for the 17th. We hereby request that you correct this. Respectfully, The Dabai Umbrella Cover Prajna Dharma Assembly, June 13.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Vocational Education in China (6) Vocational Education in the Border Provinces to Be Completed Within Three Years; Both the Number of Vocational Schools and Students Have Increased</h3>
<p>National Vocational Schools</p>
<p>Since the central government has made every effort to promote vocational education, vocational schools in various provinces and cities have been increasing in number. However, most are limited by funds, and many are simple and crude, and the content cannot be enriched. In addition to the Ministry of Education sending personnel to inspect, supervise, and urge improvements, the Central Industrial Vocational School was established in Nanjing in 1936 to serve as a model. The departments established were mechanical engineering, applied chemistry, civil engineering, and electrical engineering. After the August 13th Incident in 1937, the school moved from Nanjing to Wanxian, Sichuan Province. In 1938, it moved from Wanxian to Chongqing. There are currently eight undergraduate levels and two training levels, with a total of more than 400 students.</p>
<p>The Central Nursing and Midwifery Vocational School was originally affiliated with the Central Hospital of the Ministry of Health. In 1936, it was transferred directly under the Ministry of Education, and the funding was listed separately. The Central Midwifery School moved from Nanjing to Anqing, and in 1938, it moved from Anqing to Chongqing. There are currently four levels, with a total of more than 80 students. The Central Nursing School moved from Nanjing with the Central Hospital to Changsha, and in 1938, it moved from Changsha to Guiyang. There are currently more than 60 students.</p>
<p>In addition, the National First Midwifery School and the National Tongji University Affiliated Senior Industrial Vocational School were established around 1931 and 1932. The classes and students are still developing. The Senior Medical Vocational Department of the National Guiyang Medical College was established in 1937 and recruits students from all levels of midwifery and nursing schools in the war zone. The scale is roughly in place.</p>
<p>Vocational Education in the Border Provinces</p>
<p>In 1938, the Ministry of Education, in order to vigorously promote agricultural and industrial vocational education in the northwest and southwest provinces, specially promulgated the Plan for Agricultural and Industrial Vocational Education in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. It is divided into three regions: Northwest, Sichuan, Kang, and Southwest. The important principles are as follows: (1) Each province in each region should, with reference to the province's agricultural and industrial occupations and the distribution of raw materials, stipulate the location and subjects for setting up higher and elementary agricultural and industrial vocational schools. (2) The facilities of vocational schools can first establish factories or farms when necessary, depending on their needs, train a small number of apprentices, and gradually expand into schools. (3) All facilities of vocational schools should be planned and guided by the departments and bureaus in conjunction with higher education and production institutions of the same nature. (4) This regional promotion plan should be completed within three years. The above plan requires all provinces to quickly consult with relevant agencies to formulate implementation plans and submit them to the Ministry for approval. Most provinces have already complied.</p>
<p>Cooperation and Guidance</p>
<p>In order to seek a practical connection between construction and education, to communicate supply and demand needs, and to increase the efficiency of education and business, the Central Government formulated the Outline for Cooperation Between Vocational Schools and Construction Agencies in 1936. All schools were instructed to detail the methods for assigning students to practice with off-campus production practice agencies and to guide and assess the results of the practice. In the same year, the Measures for Establishing Advisory Committees for Vocational Schools were promulgated, requiring all schools to hire five to seven experts or leaders from the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and medical sectors who are of the same nature as the school to form a committee to discuss matters concerning students' service ethics, spiritual training, textbook selection, practical guidance, and employment. In 1937, the central government established the Construction-Education Cooperation Committee, which was composed of representatives from the departments and commissions of education, economy, transportation, military administration, internal affairs, and aviation, and was presided over by the Ministry of Education. Its tasks were to investigate various technical talents, compile various statistics, formulate plans for setting up subjects in vocational schools and specialist colleges at all levels and teaching and training programs, formulate liaison methods for education and construction national defense agencies, and coordinate the employment of graduates. There were considerable results.</p>
<p>In 1939, in order to improve the effectiveness of vocational school facilities, the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline of Measures for Zoning and Guiding Vocational Schools in Provinces and Cities. The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should closely liaise with specialist colleges and universities and production, economic, military, and industrial institutions inside and outside the province, and divide vocational school districts. They should invite specialists from the above schools and institutions to be responsible for academic and technical guidance, so that vocational schools have the convenience of assistance and supervision at all times. All personnel, administration, and teaching must be based on the opinions of the guidance agencies.</p>
<p>Vocational Education Statistics</p>
<p>Since the government has worked hard to promote vocational education in China, the following statistics can be obtained up to one year before the Anti-Japanese War. Most of the nursing and midwifery schools are not included. (1) Number of schools: 408. (2) Number of classes: 1,736. (3) Number of students: 50,205. (4) Number of teachers and staff: 7,881. (5) Amount of funding: 8,228,176 yuan. The above statistics are about one-quarter higher than the 312 schools at the time of the implementation of the standards for the establishment and funding of secondary schools in 1934. Other items such as student funding have also increased by one-quarter. In addition, the equipment, teaching, and employment of the schools, although they cannot be expressed in quantity, seem to have made considerable progress based on the observations of the Ministry of Education.

<h3>Strict Implementation of Graduation Examinations in Various Secondary Schools in This City: Graduation Examinations to Be Held After Term Examinations; School Principals to Supervise Examinations Personally, Replacing the Joint Entrance Examination System</h3>
<p>In this city, various secondary schools, regarding each graduation examination, before the war, the competent authorities used to hold a joint entrance examination system. After our army moved west, the joint graduation examinations of various schools were suspended due to environmental reasons. It is now learned that after the unanimous decision of various schools in this city this semester to continue to follow the Ministry of Education's instructions, schools have been conducting term examinations for graduating classes in recent days. Starting next week, graduation examinations will be held again, at which time the principals of each school and important military officials will personally supervise. It is said that the reason for such caution and strictness is to replace the joint entrance examination system. As for the methods for issuing graduation certificates from various secondary schools, the competent authorities have already announced that each school must compile a list of the graduates' academic performance over the years at the school, and submit the list for verification when issuing certificates, in order to exchange them for official diplomas. Otherwise, they will not be recognized in the future. It is also reported that the Ministry of Education, in view of the fact that a small number of schools in Shanghai had indiscriminately enrolled students, in order to learn from past mistakes, recently issued a strict order to all schools that the enrollment of students in the next semester must strictly comply with laws and regulations. Students must have valid credentials for admission and must not skip grades or levels. It is said that various schools have already received this circular.</p>
<p>China-Belgium Boxer Indemnity Fund Planning to Establish a Vocational School</p>
<p>Preparatory Director: Dai Ce</p>
<p>Leaves Shanghai for Yunnan to Discuss</p>
<p>The China-Belgium Boxer Indemnity Committee, at its annual meeting on April 17, proposed the establishment of a vocational school to cultivate talents, which was decided to be jointly operated with the Production and Construction Association, named the China-Belgium Construction Vocational School, which is currently under preparation. The details of the school are described below:</p>
<p>Establishment Plan</p>
<p>(1) Source and distribution of funds: The school's start-up budget is 25,000 yuan, and the recurring budget is 40,000 yuan per year. The funds will be jointly allocated by the China-Belgium Boxer Indemnity Committee and the Production and Construction Association. (2) The school is divided into senior and junior high school departments. The senior high school offers courses in commerce, civil engineering, applied chemistry, and mechanics, and admits both male and female students. The senior high school normal school department only admits female students. The junior high school offers courses in commerce, civil engineering, applied chemistry, and mechanics, and admits both male and female students. The length of study is five years.</p>
<p>Preparatory Situation</p>
<p>The preparation of the school is currently the responsibility of the Production and Construction Association, with Dai Ce, the general secretary of the association and vice principal of the China-Belgium Construction Vocational School, as the director. The preparatory committee is currently giving much consideration to the division of subjects and the implementation plan, while also paying attention to the future employment of students. Dai Ce left Shanghai on April 28 for Kunming to discuss with various parties the employment prospects of students and the school's development plan in the southwest region. It is reported that the Five Provinces Highway Bureau has proposed to entrust the school with the task of training management personnel.</p>
<p>Dai's Telegram</p>
<p>Because the school is a large-scale vocational school, the preparation is quite time-consuming. At present, there are no suitable houses in Shanghai, so it is unlikely to open and enroll students in Shanghai in the short term. However, the establishment of the school is a certainty, the only difference is the timing. The preparatory office of the school recently received a telegram from Dai Ce, stating that in order to adapt to the environment of the southwest, it is planned to set up a branch school in the Yunnan area first.</p>

<p>Science and Life</p>
<h3>Elevation and Promotion</h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>Science is sufficient to benefit the country, which is recognized by all with knowledge. The reason why it can produce the greatest effect and deeply benefit the country and society must be that, within the country, specialized knowledge and skills are particularly developed, and all important national issues can be solved by this. It must also be that common sense, habits, thoughts, and spirit of science are widespread in society, and the people of the whole country are brought into the right track of science. Then the people are rich in self-governance ability, the society has stable order, prospers day by day, and outstanding elements increase because of this. In the competitive world, it can stand forever without being eliminated by evolution. In a word: That is, specialized science must be promoted as much as possible, and the common sense of science should be promoted as much as possible. In the middle of the nineteenth century, the Englishman Huxley was deeply aware of this meaning and devoted his life to this path. At that time, science was already very developed in England. The contributions of specialized masters such as Lyell, Darwin, Hooker, Wallace, Thomson (i.e., Sir Kelvin), Tyndall, and Golden shocked the world and opened a new era in the scientific community. Mr. He was a close friend of these people, and his personal contribution to science had great value. He worked hard all his life and devoted all his strength to advanced research. However, in the midst of his busy schedule, he still engaged in the work of promoting science education, giving lectures for workers, and publishing countless simple scientific texts in domestic newspapers for all those who did not study science. Throughout his life, he almost used all his time and energy to promote science and write specialized works. As a result, British society was greatly affected, and common scientific sense was almost a household name. The intellectual level of the people increased, the education system improved, and countless experts emerged in the country to meet the urgent needs of the country. Since the nineteenth century, England has become the first strong country in the world. Today, our country needs science everywhere. Young people in the country who are determined to engage in the cause of saving the country and are deeply interested in science should strive for advanced attainments on the one hand, and assist in the popularization of science on the other hand, taking the example of what Mr. He did.</p>
<h3>Lamp and Candle</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Burning the midnight oil to obtain light, the use of lamps and candles has been around for a long time. They all stem from the act of burning. However, electric lamps have pioneered a unique path in obtaining light. Early people knew how to obtain light by burning, so they collected natural combustible materials and burned them. The use of oil lamps is likely older than candles. The earliest candles were made from animal fats. A reed stalk was used as a wick, dipped in melted tallow, again and again, to form the candle. When chemical knowledge progressed a hundred years ago, the method of making candles also went from crude to refined. The chemical composition of fatty oils was studied by the French person Huifu Lou. It was learned that although the appearance of all animal and vegetable fats is quite different, they all have a similar internal structure, and are actually compounds of glycerol and organic acids, such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid. If animal fat such as tallow is used to make candles, the compound of glycerol and oleic acid will cause the candle to tear due to its ease of melting. And when burning, glycerol becomes a kind of malodorous substance. Therefore, in modern candle making, tallow is first boiled together with acid-adjusted water to separate the fat from the fibrous material. Then lime is added and subjected to high-heat steam to decompose into glycerol and various organic acids, namely stearic acid, palmitic acid, and oleic acid. After distillation, it is pressed to remove the oleic acid. The remaining solid contains mostly stearic acid or "Si Ding". A little paraffin can be added to make the raw material for candle making. The candles made are white and hard, do not stain the fingers, burn brightly without smoke, and do not tear, which is much better than the old tallow candles.</p>
<p>Paraffin can also be used to make candles. However, it is easily softened when heated, which is not as good as those made of stearic acid. Paraffin is a mixture of various hydrogen and carbon compounds. Its properties are quite different from those of fatty acids. It is obtained from petroleum or made from brown coal (German method). It can only be used to make candles after being refined. In addition, beeswax is very similar to oil and fat in nature, and has also been used to make candles. Candles made from whale oil are used as a standard for measuring light intensity because of their large and uniform flames. An electric light bulb measured in candlepower is derived from the whale oil candle.</p>
<p>Although the materials for making candles are all combustible, they cannot burn unless they become gas. Therefore, the temperature must be high enough to cause it to vaporize before it can burn and form a flame. When a candle first burns, the oleic acid or wax on the wick gasifies and burns, and a bright flame is immediately seen. However, it soon weakens. It must wait for the candle oil in the lower part to melt before it can shine again. The burning oil rises along the wick by capillary action, the same action as a roll of paper standing upright in water, with the entire roll being soaked. The candle oil near the flame is vaporized by heat, and when ignited, it becomes a flame. The surrounding air flows due to the heat of the flame and rises in a cluster. The surroundings of the candle are kept cold and do not melt, forming a tray for holding oil. The oil does not flow out of the opening for this reason.</p>
<p>In the past, candle wicks had to be trimmed from time to time. The reason for this is that the candle wick is surrounded by oil vapor and cannot come into contact with oxygen, so it does not burn fully. Standing upright in the flame, the candle oil rises along it and cannot be completely burned. If the candle wick is not cut off, the candle flame will be dim and smoky, so it must be cut. When the French person Gong Baishi invented the use of gauze as a wick, it was no longer necessary to cut it after burning. If the wick is long, it curls up, and when it is curled, it is in contact with the air and burns out naturally. The thickness and tightness of the wick must also be appropriate to achieve a satisfactory result. A wick that has been treated with saltpeter can further prevent the candle from smoking and being cinder-free (i.e., no candle flowers).</p>
<p>The oil burned in oil lamps was originally vegetable oil. After the discovery of petroleum, which was cheaper, it was gradually used to replace vegetable oil. Petroleum is extracted from wells dug in the ground. It is formed by the long-term heat and pressure of marine animals and plants from ancient times. It contains various compounds of carbon and hydrogen, some of which are gases that escape from the ground, which is natural gas. Some are liquids and solids. Therefore, petroleum is steamed in a distiller. The products obtained when heated to between 40 degrees Celsius and 90 degrees Celsius are gasoline. The products obtained between 90 degrees Celsius and 120 degrees Celsius are volatile oil. The products obtained between 120 degrees Celsius and 150 degrees Celsius are light oil. The products obtained between 150 degrees Celsius and 300 degrees Celsius are lamp oil, namely kerosene or petroleum oil. The products obtained later are machine oil, Vaseline, and paraffin. All of the above are mixtures of hydrocarbon groups. The simplest of the gases is called marsh gas, which is the gas that is emitted when the mud at the bottom of the pond is stirred in the pond, which can burn when it encounters fire. It is also the main component of natural gas.</p>
<p>If kerosene does not have sufficient air when burning, it will not be fully oxidized, so there will be smoky flames. A lamp with a glass cover and a sufficient supply of oxygen must be used. The lamp wick that is in the shape of a circle must also have a hollow tube so that the inside of the flame can also come into contact with the air. This is the principle of the structure of modern kerosene lamps.</p>
<h3>Science Liaozhai</h3>
<p>— He Shan</p>
<p>Wolf One</p>
<p>An Englishman, traveling in Asturia, saw a group of horses chasing for water and grass, scattered on the hillside. Suddenly, several wolves arrived, trying to devour their young. The old horses quickly formed a ring, with the young ones surrounded in the middle, and the heads of the old horses all facing outwards. The wolves approached menacingly. A wolf rushed in to bite, but the old horse facing it kicked it to death with its forelegs. So they held on for a while, and the wolves knew that they could not easily invade, so they left.</p>
<p>Wolf Two</p>
<p>Also, in the mountains of Croutia, a shepherd boy was herding pigs when he encountered two wolves. Frightened and not knowing what to do, he quickly abandoned his pigs and hid. He then saw his pigs gather into a wedge-shaped formation and slowly advance towards the wolves, their back manes standing up and making deep, angry hissing sounds from time to time. One wolf saw that its anger could not be offended and immediately fled. The other wolf scrambled up a large tree, and the pigs surrounded it in a circle under the tree. Seeing that it was forced, the wolf wanted to break out, and suddenly jumped down from the tree. The pigs squeezed and knocked it down, and fought hard, teeth and hooves were added at the same time, and it died in a moment.</p>
<p>Wolf Three</p>
<p>Darwin also said that bison can help each other to defend against insults. Whenever they are invaded by wolves, they always place their young in the center. The old bulls all bear the brunt, making angry looks, and the horns of their heads can be used as weapons to resist the enemy. The wolves fear their strength, knowing that there is no hope if they get close, and although they are eager to attack, they hesitate and cannot succeed.</p>
<p>The Stranger in the Studio wrote: How important is unity! In times of peace, it can bring the benefit of friendship, and in times of crisis, it can avoid the disaster of being defeated one by one. Horses, cattle, and pigs are still like this, can people be inferior to animals?</p>
<h3>New York World's Fair Visitor Counter</h3>
<p>— Ye Ren</p>
<p>An American manufacturer of "cash counting machines" built the world's largest counting machine, installed at the recent opening of the New York World's Fair, to record the number of visitors each day. Every time a visitor enters the fairgrounds gate, the machine rings and the recording plate turns, adding one to the count. The machine is forty feet high, installed on the roof of the manufacturer's pavilion, and rotates slowly on a turntable, so that the six-foot-high illuminated numerical digits on top of the machine are visible to everyone in the entire fairgrounds day and night.</p>
<h3>Visitor Counter</h3>
<h3>"Ze Gui Mo"</h3>
<p>— Qiao Xia Ke</p>
<p>I remember that the old teacher of the Jia clan school in "Dream of the Red Chamber" once gave this stereotyped essay topic. Now that times have changed, stereotyped essays are naturally out of the question. The "Mo" referred to here neither wants to praise Mozi by following the original meaning, nor dares to be overly sensitive and take Mussolini as the subject. So, Mo is X, is Y, temporarily used as an algebraic symbol.</p>
<p>Human psychology must have something to rely on, whether it is religion, or an ideology, or like a martyr who dies for fame, or like a greedy person who dies for wealth. It is okay to say it is faith, and it is also okay to say it is superstition. Once it loses its support, it often feels like a lone boat in the sea, with a sense of endless wandering. Understanding this point, we can explain some life phenomena.</p>
<p>What is said here is all humble and not very high-minded. Let's just take two facts as examples. First, we often see advertisements for Mabaos in the newspaper. What exactly is going on? Originally, this was a very ancient belief, probably very popular in Persia and Arabia, and later spread to East Asia and Western Europe. At that time, emperors or powerful people were most afraid of being poisoned and assassinated, so they needed a personal self-defense treasure, and this was when Mabaos came into play. They placed the Mabaos at the bottom of the drinking vessel, or wrapped them with gold thread, and when eating, they used them to touch every food, and once touched, all poisons would be resolved, and so on. Regarding the treatment of diseases, Mabaos were ground into fine powder, taken internally and used externally, and all diseases could be cured, and so on. So what exactly are Mabaos? They are stones in the animal's body; in the stomach, or in the gallbladder, or in the bladder. Moreover, those who carry this treasure do not necessarily have to be horses. In terms of medicinal materials, some use sheep Mabaos, some use cow Mabaos, some use pig Mabaos, and some use camel Mabaos. The most expensive is sheep Mabaos (Persian sheep), while our country only calls them horse Mabaos. I think, humans are the spirit of all things, if human Mabaos were discovered, wouldn't that be great. However, in the hospitals of Meixian, Guangdong, human Mabaos are piled up like a small mountain, all sighing that their fate is thin, and they do not know where to belong—these are all human bladder stones.</p>
<p>Second, we often use "thousand-person needles" and other amulets as conversation aids, but we don't know that this is something that East Asia and Western Europe compete with each other in. The placenta of a pregnant woman is also a kind of thing entrusted with superstition; if it comes down with the fetus and has not yet ruptured, it is called a lucky placenta, which is even more extraordinary. The British are accustomed to sailing, but they are also afraid of drowning, so they use the lucky placenta as an amulet, saying that those who wear it will be spared the misfortune of drowning. When the lucky placenta comes into play, each one is worth twenty gold pounds. Later, navigation technology advanced rapidly, and the danger was greatly reduced, and the price of the lucky placenta also plummeted. However, twenty-three years ago (1916, during the World War), due to the occasional attacks by German submarines, the lucky placenta came into play again, and the price of each one rose to three gold pounds. Was British science still not developed at that time? No, this has nothing to do with scientific development, this is what is called "Ze Gui Mo".</p>
<p>People living on isolated islands may sneer, but hold on; look at how many Chinese houses still have Bagua diagrams hanging on the walls, how many cars still have small Fu gods hanging inside, and think about whether there are still friends who say, "A gentleman does not part with jade without reason" (it is said that wearing jade can prevent falls)? All these trivial matters, even Europe and the United States cannot completely avoid them today, this is an unavoidable "Ze Gui Mo".</p>

<p>Sexual Hygiene</p>
<h3>What Kind of Endocrine Agents Should Be Used to Treat Premature Ejaculation and Kidney Deficiency?</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Lao Da Medical School in Russia</p>
<p>The cause of kidney deficiency is due to the exhaustion of endocrine in the testicles. This is mostly due to excessive masturbation before marriage and indulging in promiscuity. Originally, sexual contact is due to the central nervous system of the brain first feeling the stimulus. Mental excitement occurs, which is transmitted to the erection center and ejaculation center in the spinal cord, causing them to be excited, and further causing the muscles and internal organs of the whole body to be excited. Therefore, the energy spent by a man in sexual intercourse is equivalent to eight hours of labor. If he indulges in promiscuity, of course, there will be disadvantages to his body. As for masturbation, it is even more harmful to the body than ordinary sexual intercourse, because masturbation only relies on one's own fantasy to arouse pornography, and it is easy to fall into excess. Therefore, as a result, it often leads to premature ejaculation, impotence, and neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Standing on the front line of clinical physicians, we have to trace the source of each patient's disease. At the same time, for the endless stream of new drugs that appear, we cannot just rely on the brief descriptions attached to each drug to determine its effectiveness. So as not to lose credibility with patients in clinical practice.</p>
<p>When it comes to drugs for treating this kind of disease, endocrine agents are naturally the most effective, but there are many kinds of endocrine agents. However, for the treatment of kidney deficiency, only the youth gland endocrine preparation "Male Tonic B-Ti-Kang" is the most effective. It is not only a supplement therapy for weakened reproductive function, but also can improve and harmonize the state of the whole body. Therefore, it can exert sufficient effectiveness for neurasthenia, incomplete development, premature aging, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea and other symptoms.</p>
<p>As for the clinical efficacy of the drug "B-Ti-Kang", doctors from various countries have detailed records. Since 1934, after Dr. France-den, a famous French doctor, conducted more than 30 chemical tests, he confirmed that the efficacy of this agent is the crown of all endocrine agents, and it has become popular all over the world. The successor was Dr. Stockholm, a famous Italian doctor, who chose the weakest newborn black bear and mixed "B-Ti-Kang" into the milk to feed it. After a week, it was more than twice as big as other black bears. He was very satisfied and believed that it was unmatched by various similar endocrine agents. His disciple Starling treated 3,000 critically ill kidney deficiency cases with this agent. Dr. Tolstoy, a famous American doctor, also said that this agent was the most perfect after nine years of experience. Its female version is a sacred medicine for regulating menstruation and seeds, and has a long-standing reputation in gynecology drugs.</p>

<h3>New Zealand Venereal Disease Hospital Announces Effective Treatment Results for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— (Written by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine)</p>
<p>The New Zealand Venereal Disease Hospital must publish an annual analysis and accounting of various treatments for venereal diseases, such as electrotherapy, surgery, and oral medication. It is felt that the only effective medicine for gonorrhea is "Kreinon", invented by Dr. Peter of Germany. Dr. Hanwell, the director of gonorrhea at the hospital, made a precise statistic. In acute gonorrhea, taking three or four bottles of "Kreinon" can completely cure 97 out of 100 people. After more than 15 decisions of blood tests and the use of prostate massage, it has been proven to be completely cured.</p>
<p>Dr. Hanwell also used general chemical therapy and membrane penetration therapy for testing, and only three or four out of 100 people were cured, and there was still the disadvantage of recurrence. Therefore, the drug "Kreinon" has become a recognized effective medicine for gonorrhea by doctors all over the world.</p>
<p>Dr. Lewis of the United States also published the treatment results of the drug "Kreinon" in the hospital of Ben Snowveni, proving Dr. Hanwell's theory. Dr. La said, I have tried many drugs for treating gonorrhea, but the results are not as good as "Kreinon". The reason is that the theory on which this agent is based is the use of non-specific therapy, which is very different from general chemical therapy and membrane penetration sterilization therapy. For acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, I use "Kreinon" for treatment, and the cure rate is 96.8%. No current gonorrhea oral medication has such a noble treatment result. As for external medication, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Card-It-Snow-Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories, washing themselves at home according to the diagrams and instructions, then the effect will be great. Since the invention of the drug "Kreinon", countless men and women suffering from gonorrhea have been completely freed from this suffering by the gift of this drug. Doctors should pay attention to this drug.</p>
<h3>Harm of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Pulmonary disease is the most violent disease that deprives human life, and it is a great enemy of human prosperity. Therefore, people with pulmonary disease should be treated as soon as possible. Once the lungs lose their health, tuberculosis will become increasingly worse. At first, the spirit will be depressed, night sweats will decrease, and then chest pain and cough will occur. Finally, the face will be yellow and thin, sputum and blood will be coughed up, tinnitus, headache, insomnia, palpitations, shortness of breath, dyspnea, and difficulty sleeping. If only symptomatic treatment is used, although it can stop the superficial symptoms, the tuberculosis bacteria still exist, and even easier to breed, and more pathological changes will occur. Only the drug "Bufei Nal" has a truly different effect, because it can kill tuberculosis bacteria, shrink lesions, and even restore the corroded lung cavities to their original state. This is the most ideal pulmonary disease oral medication. As for the symptom of cough, taking this agent can relieve cough and expectorant within three hours, and it is effective in every test.</p>
<h3>Cured Examples of Spermatorrhea: Bedwetting in Childhood, Spermatorrhea in Adulthood</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany</p>
<p>Patient Tang Youqian, 20 years old, (claimed) that he had been weak, thin and sick since he was a child, and often had bedwetting. Although he prepared carefully, it was ineffective. It was not until he was sixteen years old that bedwetting stopped, and spermatorrhea was discovered. At first, it was nocturnal emission, and then there was spermatorrhea without dreams, and the number gradually increased, and the spirit was depressed. (Cure process) Tang's disease was caused by congenital weakness, so he was ordered to take care of his health, often do outdoor exercise, and take "Naires Spermatorrhea Tablets" to strengthen the sperm barrier. Take "B-Ti-Kang" to supplement weakness. After three months, spermatorrhea has disappeared, and the body has become stronger day by day.</p>
<h3>Premarital Masturbation Causes Premature Ejaculation After Marriage</h3>
<p>Patient Fan Hongda, 25 years old, (claimed) that when he was 16 years old, he was seduced by a cousin who was three years older than him, and committed the bad habit of masturbation. A year later, spermatorrhea occurred, but the number was very sparse. Unexpectedly, after marriage, he was impotent and unable, and sexual intercourse only lasted a few seconds. For the sake of posterity, he came to seek treatment (Cure process). He was ordered to take "Naires Spermatorrhea Tablets" to strengthen the sperm barrier, and was given "Sleeve-Ti-Kang" and electrotherapy every day, and he recovered in three months.</p>
<p>Trivial Words About Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>Why is it Easy to be Infertile When Suffering from Orchitis?</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Where do human beings come from? Evolutionists must say that human beings evolved from apes, but in fact, I say that the reason why our human beings continue to grow is entirely dependent on the unremitting work of the testicles to produce sperm. The responsibility of this organ is paramount. It is a regrettable thing that human beings are often invaded by diseases, so that the "birthplace of mankind" is ruined. The testicles are most easily broken by diseases, especially gonorrhea. Therefore, patients with gonorrhea should be quickly cured before the gonococcus invades the testicles, so as to avoid the consequences of prolonged and difficult healing.</p>
<p>But if a patient with gonorrhea is really invaded by gonococcus into the testicles one day, there is no need to be pessimistic. Because if the gonococcus has already invaded the testicles, it often invades the right testicle first, that is, it becomes epididymitis. At this time, because the gonococcus has just invaded, the tissues in the testicle have not been completely destroyed by the gonococcus. If treatment is rapid and legal, it is not difficult to cure. However, if it once causes a prairie fire, and the left and right testicles are completely affected by this poison, it will destroy the function of producing sperm, forming the danger of male infertility. I use German anti-gonorrhea serum and the effective medicine for gonorrhea "Kreinon" as oral medication, and also use static electricity therapy, so that the patient is absolutely quiet. So, the safe and thorough treatment is carried out, so that the patient is absolutely quiet. So, the safe and thorough treatment is carried out. In acute orchitis, the swelling can be reduced within two days and the root can be cured within a week. In chronic orchitis, it will not be cured without three or four weeks. According to the statistics on my diagnosis book for the past 20 years, all gonorrheal orchitis cured by me can restore reproductive function, have children, and have no bad prognosis. Therefore, it is a mistake for people with orchitis to fall into pessimism. Consultation hours are from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. From today, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation every day. Each number only costs 50 cents and comes with a copy of "The Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth one yuan.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Futures Soar, Cash Continues to Climb to High Peak, Once Seeing a New Price of 648 Yuan, Foreign Banks Take Advantage of the High Price to Come Out, and the Rise is Suddenly Frustrated</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash spot market conditions, the difference between the ups and downs was not as drastic as in the past few days, but the market trend was still mostly illusory, showing a trend of first soaring and then slightly falling. At first, it was because the aftershocks of the six consecutive days of rising had not subsided, and it was heard that foreign exchange futures suddenly tightened sharply, and people's hearts were even more firm. In addition, the spot chips have been emptied a lot after being vigorously collected by the Tianjin-Hong Kong and local gangs (stockbrokers who only buy and do not sell). The Japanese gang continued to entrust securities brokers and a certain money exchange to start purchasing again, and the Hong Kong gang also entered as soon as the price fell, so the market trend moved towards the peak, and once again created an unprecedented high price of 2,648 yuan. Later, a certain gold company (on behalf of speculators) and a certain bank (on behalf of foreign firms taking advantage of the high price to come out, the market trend suddenly reversed and fell, but the result still soared by 50 yuan. The whole day's trading was still strong, reaching about 4,000 taels. Silver building jewelry gold also followed the rise and fall, and the Greater Union Association once raised to 268 yuan, which was an unprecedented high price. The result was a continued increase of 6 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold were neither honored nor disgraced.</p>

Around 11:30, Guest Gangs Came to Absorb and Purchase Again, and a Certain Gold Company Also Took the Opportunity to Leverage Strongly, Causing the Rising Wind to Rise Again, and Angered to 635 Yuan Again. Later, the Silver Brokers Spilled 50 Taels to the Money Exchange, and the Price Returned to 628 Yuan. The Power of the Money Exchange Mutually Did 50 Taels, and 630 Yuan Was the Noon Closing Price. In the Early Afternoon, the Market Trend Was Still Flat. First, a Certain Money Exchange Entered a Cash Gold Company at 50 Taels, and the Price Was the Same as the Noon Closing, Which Was 630 Yuan.

It Was Calculated that the Securities Brokers Entered a Cash Gold Company at 50 Taels, and a Certain Money Exchange Entered a Fellow Industry at 50 Taels, and the Price Was Both 2,648 Yuan, Which Was an Unprecedented High Market Price.

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Gold Prices Rise Daily, Bulls are Enthusiastic About High Prices, 20-Count Double Horse Breaks Through 500 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Due to the stabilized foreign exchange rate and rising gold prices, market participants generally have a strong bullish outlook on the yarn market. In addition, both banks and money shops in the financial sector are also flocking to the spot yarn market, moving in and out frequently. A certain cotton company has also come to search for and purchase goods. Although prices have entered high territory, buyers are still in a state of excitement. The peak price for 20-count Double Horse yarn reached 502 yuan, only 6 yuan short of last year's peak price. It is noted that the spot yarn price last Tuesday was 430 yuan. Since the foreign exchange rate contracted last Wednesday, it has jumped for five consecutive days, rising by a substantial 72 yuan, which is not insignificant. Therefore, actual demand remains slow and sluggish, but market prices have already shown inconsistencies, indicating that people are wavering and uncertain.</p>
<p>Regarding the spot yarn situation, the opening this morning continued the momentum from the previous day, with prices rising immediately. The warehouse receipt price for 20-count Double Horse was 490 yuan, Shepherd was up by 5 yuan at 45 yuan, and spot Double Horse reached 500 yuan. Shortly after, selling interest increased slightly, and quotations declined. Double Horse warehouse receipts fell to 85 yuan. It is said that Yifeng took advantage of the low price to buy 75 bales, and the spot price was 495 yuan, a drop of 5 yuan in an instant. Unexpectedly, a certain bank and a certain money shop suddenly came in to buy, and the market price immediately rose. 20-count Double Horse broke through the 500 yuan mark, reaching 502 yuan. The highest price for warehouse receipts was 495 yuan. Another round of consolidation occurred midway. Because prices have been rising steadily for several days, profit-takers considered their gains sufficient and have started to take profits, holding the cash as the principle. In addition, the foreign exchange rate was fixed at 6.5 pence. The closing price for 20-count Double Horse spot was 495 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 487.5 yuan, similar to the closing price on the previous day. The situation at the opening in the afternoon was tight again, with gold prices said to be very high. A certain company came in to buy again, and sentiment suddenly became strong. 20-count Double Horse once reached 500 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 495 yuan. Before long, scattered bulls took profits and retreated, causing a setback. By the time of the closing price, 20-count Double Horse outside warehouse was priced at 498 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was called at 493 yuan. In the end, various groups bought 2,855 bales. In terms of price movements, 20-count Double Horse rose by 4 yuan, Double Globe fell by 0.5 yuan, Shepherd rose by 2 yuan, and Wufu rose by 6 yuan.

The opening price in the afternoon was flat, followed by profit-taking due to reports of weak actual demand. The market saw a decline, with the closing price at 408 yuan, down 7 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Disappointment with Export Subsidies, U.S. Cotton Suddenly Drops More Than Ten Points, Foreign Cotton Transactions Only Involve Resales to Japanese Factories, Brazilian Cotton Reaches Unprecedented Price of 120 Yuan</h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, New York opened higher due to favorable reports from Liverpool and Bombay, and cotton fabric transactions were more active, causing cotton prices to rise slightly by two or three points. Later, due to the agricultural meeting held in Washington yesterday to discuss the issue of cotton export subsidies, it was found that according to the budget for the cotton industry, there was a shortage of 338,000,000 yuan, so the export subsidy was stopped and stagnated. A certain congressman stated that the focus of future discussions would be slightly changed, with the intention of setting a certain price for U.S. cotton consumed domestically, so that the cotton prices of other countries could be sought based on this price. Yesterday, various traders expressed disappointment with the export subsidy, and the South sold heavily on the market, causing the closing price to fall by more than ten points. India, including forecasts, rose by one rupee, and Egypt rose by more than ten points.</p>

<p>Bairro G 91.75 Fellow Traders Import 100 Pieces Cash, Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Pingguo Er 75.50 Fellow Traders Import 100 Pieces Cash, Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, foreign companies had no transactions due to excessively high prices. Transactions among fellow traders were very busy, mostly involving resales to Japanese yarn factories. Brazilian cotton, which can be used for 32-count yarn, has risen to 120 yuan, 20-count Bairro G is at 95 yuan, 16-count Rangoon is at 84 yuan, and 10-count Pingguo Er is also as high as 74 yuan, reaching unprecedentedly high prices.</p>
<p>The local cotton trade remains sluggish, and prices are firm and rising, continuing to advance, as inventory is becoming increasingly short and the exchange rate has increased after the exchange rate adjustment, making people more bullish. As for foreign cotton trading among fellow traders, it is still frequent, and market prices are rising. The supply from northern Jiangsu is becoming scarce again, with only 164 bales of Tongzhou cotton arriving. 75 pieces of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong for export. The current spot cotton situation is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Factory Prices Higher Than Market Prices, Reaching Up to One Yuan, Financial Sector Searches Intensively, Eastern Cloth Soars</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the sharp rise in cotton yarn and Eastern cloth, factory prices were significantly higher than market prices, reaching almost one yuan per piece. However, the rise in cloth prices was more moderate than in the yarn market. Now, with the market trend firm and people feeling optimistic, there are more buyers, and speculation is rampant. The financial sector is also searching and purchasing more, so market prices are rising gradually. Coarse cloth rose by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan per piece in the morning, and continued to rise by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan per piece in the afternoon. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by 0.2 to 0.4 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth also increased in price by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan. EWO bleached cloth rose from 16.5 yuan to 17 yuan. Hongzhang's Three Sheep striped pongee cloth opened this week at 0.56 yuan per yard, a huge increase of 0.05 yuan per yard compared to the previous Monday. Lunchang's new dark-colored crepe de chine opened at 13 yuan per piece, with the busiest trading among fellow traders on this street and speculators. In total, over a thousand pieces of coarse cloth, over two hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill were traded. Dyeing factories continued to purchase three hundred pieces of fine twill as dyeing blanks. Customer routes were smoother in eastern Zhejiang, with over two hundred pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill purchased, and over a hundred boxes of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, pongee, broadcloth, velvet, and corduroy. Over two thousand pieces of colored cloth were purchased in Taizhou and Xinghua in northern Jiangsu, and over a hundred boxes of colored cloth and colored twill were purchased by Cantonese traders. Over three thousand pieces of colored cloth and floral cloth were purchased overseas in Little Luzon, Siam, and Singapore.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>White goods, due to the eagerness of traders both inside and outside the industry to hoard them, were repeatedly raised in price. The market for fine cloth and fine twill has been soaring. This morning, the peak price for next month's futures of Dragon Head fine cloth reached 15.25 yuan, then retreated due to sales from Tianjin traders, but the market rebounded due to a shortage of chips. As a result, the spot price of Dragon Head was 14.9 yuan, 15 yuan for this month, and 15.1 yuan for next month. Other brands such as Yanghe, Wufu, and Trumpet were consistently raised in price due to absorption by fellow traders, increasing by 0.4 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. A total of about two thousand pieces were traded. On the foreign company side, only Eastern Cotton opened sales of 200 bales of Qingdao-made Happy Crane brand fine cloth at 12 pounds.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 14th, 25 pieces of textiles were shipped to Beihai, 80 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 150 pieces to Hong Kong, 9 pieces to Xiamen, and 505 pieces to Shantou. Also, on the 13th, 92 pieces arrived from Yantai.</p>
<h3>Grains: Mildew Season, Little Rain, Rice Prices Rise Again, Combined Old Measure Nears 22 Yuan, Nanjing Indica Above 16 Yuan</h3>
<p>Du Geng: Yesterday, the total arrival of various groups from the river reached 2,450 white packages of Songjiang Gang No. 4 and Che Lun Baozi, along with Su Kun. The time is approaching the mildew season for rice planting, but unfortunately, there is a drought and lack of rain, causing farmers to have difficulty planting rice. People are therefore taking precautions. The sales market on this street is exceptionally active, and both speculators and traders are showing caution, and the market seems to have difficulty meeting demand, so the market is rising rapidly. Special Chang Geng has even reached 19 yuan, and other thinner and thicker Geng are also around 18 yuan, an increase of more than 0.5 yuan compared to before. Looking back at the recent rice market, it has been rising all the way, and compared to last week, the price of Geng rice has risen by about 1.5 yuan, which, converted to the old measure, is 21.67 yuan.</p>
<p>The price of Wuhu-produced indica rice for passenger use has been gradually rising. Yesterday's telegram indicated an increase of one yuan in two days, reaching over sixteen yuan in Shanghai. Traders took the opportunity to sell off, and the morning market once soared by 0.6 to 0.7 yuan. The price of intermediate goods was already around 15 yuan. Later, because the price was high, speculators started to release goods, but the result was still more than 0.5 yuan higher. 6 to 7 thousand packages were traded. Nanjing indica has already been quoted at over 16 yuan, but most of the arrivals yesterday were still speculators. As for the price of Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian, they also followed up by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Various Factories Restrict Supply, Flour Market Exceptionally Strong</p>
<p>Kunshan New Wheat Continues to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>The current market for flour from local factories is exceptionally strong, driven by the black market foreign exchange rate. The cost of imported flour has increased, with a difference of more than 0.5 yuan per bag compared to before. Moreover, the raw materials for factory flour are also imported wheat, so although factory prices have already increased by 0.3 yuan, they are planning to continue to increase. Furthermore, with customer sales increasing, various factories are taking this opportunity to restrict supply. It has been reported that both the north and south groups have stopped operations for many days. After a brief period of smooth operations the day before, importers must also have very strong demand, so the number of transactions has been reduced by half compared to before. As for retail transactions on this street and among individual households, there are still more than 10,000 bags. The price of No. 2 flour opened at 4.75 yuan, an increase of 0.05 yuan compared to before. It is reported that imported flour is quoted at over 5 yuan, but the actual selling price is 4.7 yuan in cash, which, combined with the exchange rate, is also over 4.9 yuan. Therefore, the market environment is constantly rising. Today, 19,800 bags of flour will be shipped to Shantou, and 1,000 bags of wheat bran will also be shipped to Shantou.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of new wheat continued with a few batches arriving in Shanghai but not yet officially on the market. Upon investigation, the Nanjing wheat that recently arrived, because the Chinese factories have not yet started operations, the Japanese merchants and passenger traders have also stalled. With the flour price rising day by day, those holding goods are planning to sell at good prices, and most are waiting to sell on the warehouse, so the market supply is particularly sparse. However, it is heard that 60 bags of Kunshan new wheat continued to arrive, with better quality than the first batch, and were purchased by the street at a price of 6.08 yuan, an increase of over 0.4 yuan compared to the previous settlement.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Factory Sales Open at 2,150 Yuan, First High Price After Foreign Exchange Changes, Tussah Silk Sells Well in India and the Philippines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market: The trend in Japan and the United States was still weak, with New York futures down 0.08 points for both near and deferred months. The spot price of Japanese silk fell by 0.06 to 0.07 points, Shanghai silk fell by 0.03 points, Guangdong silk fell by 0.01 points, and Yokohama spot price fell by another 20 yuan, a decrease of more than 140 yuan compared to two weeks ago. One reason for this is that the cocoon collection in the East Market has not yet been completed, and silk prices are still being suppressed. On the other hand, the main factor is that autumn textiles in the United States are more focused on rayon.</p>
<p>The local silk market still has no clear performance. This is because the transportation of cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is still in dispute. The foreign company silk market had a grade of 7-8 white and the factory opened at 2,150 yuan, the first high price settlement after the exchange rate change, but transactions in England, France, and America were not stimulated by this, and buying interest did not increase. On the contrary, transactions in India and Africa suddenly became very active yesterday. Meida, Samsung, Xiangli and other companies opened sales of 80 loads of Tussah silk, including Qianjin wood town silk. In addition, 25 loads of Dou Gong silk were also traded, and silk prices are rising sharply. In the green tea market, the total transaction volume of Chun Mee, Needle Mee, etc., reached more than 580 boxes. The top price for hand-picked tea opened at 275 yuan, and the price for ordinary Chun Mee opened at 220 yuan. The market continues to rise by 7 or 8 yuan. Today, five pieces of tea will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Fellow Townsman</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>A certain organization where people of a certain surname swarm like bees and ants can be called a "certain surname ancestral hall." Similarly, a certain organization where people from a certain place gather like maggots and flies can also be called "the hometown association of that place" or "a certain place guild."</p>
<p>The formation of these "hometown associations" or "guilds" is, of course, due to those in power not forgetting their old friends and pulling them in. Examples from the past include arranging butchers and wine sellers from Fengpei in the Sishui Pavilion, and more recently, arranging barbers and foot masseuses from Yexian by the Dog Meat General. Thus, in this "association," if you are not related to royalty, you must be a prince or minister wearing a yellow jacket. Then they call friends and acquaintances to join, forming a pure and magnificent spectacle. When Liu An attained enlightenment, even his chickens and dogs ascended to heaven. If you are not a chicken or dog, don't even think about getting in. If you, in your dignified seven-foot frame, want to replace a chicken or a dog, you can't even move, and you're likely to be pecked or bitten. Liu An belongs to them, what does it have to do with you!</p>
<p>The bond of people with the same surname is the backbone of a patriarchal society. Similarly, the mutual assistance of people from the same hometown is a vestige of the feudal system. I can't bear to say that the patriarchal society is wrong, and similarly, how dare I say that the feudal system is bad? Moreover, erudite scholars often cite ancient examples to prove the inevitability and necessity of the feudal system and the existence of hometown relations. They say:</p>
<p>When Chinese people go abroad, Chinese people abroad are all fellow countrymen. In the future, when people on Earth go to Mars or any planet, people on Earth on other planets will all be fellow countrymen. When people in the solar system go to other star systems, people in the solar system in other star systems will all be fellow countrymen. When people in this universe go to another universe, people in this universe in another universe will all be fellow countrymen... Then, to shrink it down and tighten it up, considering an organization, recognizing fellow countrymen makes people feel closer, and determining that those who are not of my race are of a different mind is not surprising.</p>
<p>Sometimes I want to spoil the fun and say, since everyone in the same universe is a fellow countryman, or to put it more simply, since all Chinese people are fellow countrymen, isn't it good to have such a big hometown? Why must we have the small hometowns that make a ritual in the snail shell? The scholars say, this is called division of labor and cooperation, and gathering strength from all quarters. With small hometowns, it's naturally easier to form a large hometown. Everyone organizes small hometowns and excludes non-hometown people: the way of the ancient kings, this is beautiful! When they bring up the ancient kings, I can only keep quiet, because I am still a modern person and don't understand the ancient kings.</p>
<p>However, the human heart is made of flesh after all, and thinking about the benefits of hometown associations, they really cannot be buried. For example, hometown associations have mortuaries, so that you won't have nowhere to be buried when you die. Hometown associations transport coffins, so that you can be buried in your hometown when you die, and your soul can return to your homeland... Chinese people, who have always valued post-mortem glory, still need to rely on hometown associations to be able to rest in peace. So, how do we know that a "hometown association" in miniature, a certain organization, will not only accommodate the living but also accommodate the dead? We should especially praise its boundless merits in this regard.</p>
<p>Because hometowns have so many benefits, everyone likes to recognize fellow townsmen. If there is a big shot or any famous person in their hometown, it is of course their glory and they will definitely boast about it to everyone. Within a country, the same province is the same hometown, and even in more distant places, neighboring provinces are also the same hometown. Within a province, the same prefecture or the same circuit or the same special region is the same hometown. The starting point of a hometown is originally the county, but when necessary, it is expanded to encompass a wider area. Even if there is only the name of a hometown without the reality, people still keep talking about hometown, because the term hometown is really too mesmerizing.</p>
<p>"Su Xiao of Qiantang is a kinswoman from my hometown," and "kinswoman" is also the same as fellow townsman. "Hou Shi-weng" is so complacent about it. "Old fellow countrymen" performed on stage in Tianjin and won much welcome. "Stopping the boat to ask temporarily, perhaps they are fellow countrymen." The delicate voice suggests what kind of person she is....</p>
<p>But if you want to recognize him as a fellow townsman, he refuses to recognize you as a fellow townsman, this also happens a lot. The reason is that you are obviously a bungler, and he is obviously successful. You will harm him, so he will of course not recognize you. Gongsun Hong of the Han Dynasty lamented, "I'd rather meet a bad guest than an old friend," and this is the reason. And there are also those who betray fellow townsmen to gain merit. It is said that in the past, the censors impeached their relatives, old friends, and fellow townsmen, because only the misdeeds of fellow townsmen could they know in detail, so they could avoid errors based on hearsay....</p>
<p>Writing this, it makes people shiver about fellow townsmen again. What should we do?</p>
<h3>PhD: "Old fogey, eat a big pancake!"</h3>
<h3>In the Mountain Hollow</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>——Memories of the Breakout from Xuzhou</p>
<p>After passing that wheat field, ahead were two bare stone mountains flanking a narrow pass. Beside the pass stood a tall mountain covered in green grass—it was so majestic and perilous that, if the enemy had even a single machine gun positioned there, we wouldn't have dreamed of getting through the valley. But they were positioned on the mountain peaks in front of the highway, thinking we would certainly follow that road. They didn't expect us to detour this way, around the side of the mountain.</p>
<p>Just as we were walking through the narrow pass, suddenly a plane came chasing from behind. Although everyone was a little anxious and wanted to scatter quickly, in this rugged valley with no cover, it was impossible to spread out. Helpless, we could only be bold and continue dispersing as if nothing was happening.</p>
<p>After passing through the pass, we sat down by the foot of a mountain, waiting for Commander Zhang who was behind us. We saw the continuous stream of troops emerging from the pass like a flood, blurring our vision. Suddenly, three heavy bombers flew over with a terrifying, deep rumble. The troops quickly scattered and lay down beside the road and in the wheat fields. However, some of the troops had nowhere to hide and could only squat on the road, letting the horses graze on the green grass by the roadside.</p>
<p>The three heavy bombers, gleaming with the light of the setting sun, leisurely circled in the sky. They flew to the airspace above the pass, and suddenly one of them descended:</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>A burst of fire erupted, followed by a thin wisp of black smoke that rose into the sky and slowly dissipated.</p>
<p>The mountains and fields were exceptionally quiet, with only a monotonous humming sound echoing.</p>
<p>After circling once, the three heavy bombers flew to the front, not far away, and a long series of explosions rang out like thunder:</p>
<p>——Boom! Boom! Boom!……</p>
<p>One plane flew back, suddenly descending, half-tilting its wings, and strafing the wheat field:</p>
<p>——Da da da da da……</p>
<p>Along with the brothers of the Special Service Company, we lay neatly at the foot of the mountain, watching those three planes with pride and shame, madly circling in the sky, our hearts filled with extreme anger!</p>
<p>The sun had set, and the sky was overcast. As the night crept into the distance of the fields, appearing somewhat hazy, the three planes finally flew away.</p>
<p>The brothers who had rested beside the road and in the wheat fields got up, smiles on their faces:</p>
<p>"Damn it, they come bombing every day, but they never manage to kill me!"</p>
<p>"These big liars, after bombing us today, I wonder how they'll be telling their people: 'We killed so many of them today!'"</p>
<p>"Their people are so pitiful! Their hard-earned money is just used by their warlords to buy bombs and drop them on our land, and they still suffer from their deceitful propaganda. It's truly unjust!"</p>
<p>Treading on the vast twilight, the column set off again along an uneven dirt road.</p>
<h3>Germ and Anesthetic Warfare (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By J.M. Murray, translated by Tian Ren</p>
<p>"When the war breaks out, millions of soldiers gather at the front. Suddenly, enemy artillery fire fiercely bombards them. The shells that land among them are a bit different, all exploding into fine dust. Showers of 'shell dust' fall on the soldiers, and immediately thousands upon thousands collapse to the ground, losing consciousness. In an instant, millions of troops are anesthetized and fall to the ground. Then, the artillery fire ceases, followed by a large number of enemies pouring in like a tide. The millions of unconscious people are disarmed and completely surrounded by the enemy, with many machine guns set up at key locations. Soon, they gradually awaken. As they regain consciousness, loudspeakers set up in all directions tell them that if they do not surrender, they will be annihilated. Naturally, they feel that sacrifice is futile and surrender unconditionally. The war thus comes to an end."</p>
<p>(IV) George Bernard Shaw Prefers Anesthetic or Gas Warfare</p>
<p>The great British writer George Bernard Shaw, in his recent commentary on war weapons, declared that he would rather be anesthetized and lose consciousness, or even suffocate from poison gas, than be blown to pieces by sixteen-inch guns.</p>
<p>On November 4, 1937, three New York chemists reported to the American Chemical Society on how millions of people could be anesthetized in a decisive war. They said that the anesthetic that could be loaded into shells is a type of acetyl chloride, mixed with an irritant that can erode the skin, so the anesthetic can penetrate blood vessels, lower blood pressure, and cause loss of consciousness. Changing the ratio of drugs can make the effective time last from several minutes to several hours.</p>
<p>Many people will think that using anesthetics in a decisive war does not feel terrifying, but in addition, there are many disgusting anesthetics, and war leaders may have bestial outbreaks and use them to poison the enemy.</p>
<p>(V) Soviet Russia Races to Produce Wartime Anesthetics</p>
<p>Soviet leaders have publicly declared that if they are forced to fight, they will annihilate the enemy in the shortest possible time. Experts from the former German Republic have established great chemical factories throughout Russia. Russian political leaders also never hide that their chemical factories are manufacturing anesthetics and poison gas for war day and night, in order to quickly eliminate enemies who attack them. German chemical factories are also working hard to manufacture anesthetics and poison gas for the next war. British chemists warned the world a year ago that they might be forced to resort to using poison to fight poison in the next decisive war.</p>
<p>The resistance behavior of prisoners and frequent attempts to escape are annoying. During the World War, it was suggested to force prisoners to smoke opium in order to save trouble, but fortunately it was not actually adopted. But in the next decisive war, it may be adopted. Or even a ruthless country will give their prisoners a "hypnotic pill." Due to the effects of a malignant anesthetic, prisoners may become addicted to killing, while at the same time being mentally confused, unable to distinguish between friend and foe, and be sent back to their own country to kill their comrades.</p>
<p>(VI) Humane Warfare (?)</p>
<p>Scientific experts want to use anesthetic poison gas as war weapons to absolve themselves of the responsibility for manufacturing killing weapons, and therefore write articles arguing that using anesthetic poison gas as a weapon is more humane than blasting human bodies to pieces with artillery fire. They say that if the ultimate goal is to make the enemy surrender, then the more humane method of making the enemy lose consciousness with anesthetics can be used. They point out that there are at least a dozen anesthetics that can make people emotionally indifferent, unwilling to do anything, and hate anything, the only hope is "peace".</p>
<p>Just imagine, if the people of an entire country are anesthetized during wartime, then important industries will stop, and even a small part cannot be made in munitions factories, and naturally they will be defeated.</p>
<p>Several well-known experts have declared that it is easy to put anesthetics in the drinking water sources of enemy countries in wartime. It is more difficult to put anesthetics in food, but water sources are very easy to put anesthetics in.</p>
<p>This method of anesthetizing the enemy, even if used on a large scale, is not easy to detect. Because there are no obvious signs, no poisoning, no death, just an increase in national indifference. People will not care about who wins or loses the war, they just hope for peace quickly, no matter what the conditions.</p>
<p>Now it seems like a dream to say that anesthetics will be the decisive factor in world wars, but we must remember that modern war weapons such as airplanes, submarines, and tanks were also thought to be people's dreams before! (Translated from World Magazine)</p>
<h3>A Truth</h3>
<p>— Shi De</p>
<p>If there were no truth in the world, I would add this one for it; if there were already many truths, I would only believe this one: "Willpower is the first life of mankind."</p>
<p>If I hadn't established this belief in my heart early on, I might have committed suicide because of that setback two years ago; if it weren't for the encouragement of this sentence, I would have wondered in surprise: Why haven't I shed a single tear for a disappointing event in recent years?</p>
<p>Currently, countless people have ruined their families, but they don't complain to anyone. They feel that in order to cope with difficult times, a persevering fighting spirit is more valuable than gaining the sympathy of others.</p>
<p>Friends! If you believe this is a truth, you should always believe it. If you don't know it yet, then please think it over carefully. (Charity Auction Donation)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Talking About "Farmer's Song"</h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>Produced by the Soviet Ukrainian Film Factory, screening day and night at the Shanghai Guangda Theater today.</p>
<p>Early on, when reading about the collective farm peasants of the Bizina and October Revolution communes in "Soviet Anecdotes," and how they lived, cultivated, raised livestock, produced, and consumed together, I felt very surprised and envious. But this is not a fabricated myth, but an ironclad fact. The Soviet collective farms described in the book vividly appear before our eyes in "Farmer's Song." When we see the abundant agricultural products and mechanized harvesting on the screen, the envy in our hearts surges again. Soviet collective farms are progressing rapidly. The October Revolution commune in 1930 had just bought a tractor and started applying chemical fertilizers, while the collective farms in "Farmer's Song" not only have many tractors, but also have a good harvest.</p>
<p>Although the theme of "Farmer's Song" is to encourage production, it has a very good impact on China in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>First: China's War of Resistance is a long-term one. In addition to military and political aspects, actively launching production work in the rear is a major condition for supporting the long-term War of Resistance. The majority of China's production is agriculture. How to improve agriculture has become a very urgent issue to study. Naturally, it is still impossible for China to establish collective farms immediately, but it is possible to partially adopt the advantages of collective farms according to China's situation. At least, the establishment of a collective farm system is of great help to national defense, because the farmers of collective farms are already organized, have received political training, understand the power of unity, and those tractors can also be converted into weapons at any time. It not only enriches the resources of the War of Resistance, but also makes invaders feel like they are trapped when they invade collective farms. Some people may worry that it is not easy to realize, but weren't the Kutzina farm and October Revolution commune of the Soviet Union also grown up in difficulties and hardships?</p>
<p>Second: It tells us that love and work are not opposing. The Soviet Union does not only value work and have no love; however, it tells us that we must talk about love without hindering work. The farmers in "Farmer's Song" who were madly in love were finally persuaded by the correct theory of the work team leader. I think this can play a little educational role on the isolated island, because even though the isolated island is far from the fire, many people are indulged in erotic pleasure, even abandoning their own work and putting themselves in death. "Farmer's Song" corrects this kind of mistake. Regarding this point, I especially admire the strong agitation method of the screenwriter Bomiskikov. The love disputes he depicts are not like Hollywood screenwriters who create a "sexy and funny" story; on the contrary, he incites both sides to step up their work from the love disputes.</p>
<p>The high skill of Bomiskikov's artistic skills can be seen from the fact that this simple story is depicted so vividly. There is preaching in it, but we can't see the shadow of his preaching. He used some comedy techniques, exaggerating the watchman and the accountant a little. The Soviet comedy technique is a bit different from Hollywood's. It does not forget reality and realism in exaggeration.</p>
<p>Some people say that Soviet films are almost all rough and careless, but the director of "Farmer's Song" seems very delicate, such as:</p>
<p>(1) The accountant is sorting out documents, the documents are suddenly blown away by the wind, the camera focuses on the door, and Marinka is pushed in to fight.</p>
<p>(2) Using very flexible lenses to describe couples in the forest, two points are more worth noting: (A) The lens shakes down from the couple on the bridge, the lens sweeps across the river surface, shakes up, and another couple is singing under the trees by the river. (B) Using past sounds and space, singing echoes in the empty forest, and the lens moves arbitrarily in the space.</p>
<p>(3) In the end, Marinka and Skola have a quarrel, and everyone sings in their own home. The director uses sound splicing, which is very clever.</p>
<p>The most powerful scene is after Skola said bad things about Marinka, the women's team stepped up their work. At this time, the director used high-speed lens changes to write about them shouting, singing, and stacking crops. The editing here is particularly agile. Yes, the time and space on the sound surface before and after the big storm are not consistent enough. To put it clearly, the close-up and full-view shots cannot be fully coordinated, such as:</p>
<p>(1) Close-up: The clouds in the sky gradually darken; the wind blows the grass in front of the camera; the stacked crops are blown down; the women grab and stack...</p>
<p>(2) Long shot: The sky is very bright, it doesn't look like a rainy day, only water is sprinkled down in front of the camera as rain, but this rain cannot be coordinated with the space.</p>
<p>This is naturally a minor matter. And it's mostly an artistic issue. The director's treatment of the whole is always completed in a majestic and lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>I quite like Lyubesh Guiyev, who played the accountant. It is said that this was his first time making a film, but his acting skills can make this character typical. His actions are exaggerated, quite clownish, but he can understand this character very well. Distorting a little, the character will become a bad guy who destroys the collective farm. In fact, he is just selfish and provokes other people's feelings. The best parts of his play are: (1) Pulling Skola in for a haircut. (2) When Makalin is next to the team leader, investigating the accountant's report card, he deliberately eavesdrops on the side, showing an awkward look. (3) His embarrassment when he was chased by the watchman, and his joy when he won the award.</p>
<p>The watchman in Tollih performs quite honestly and cutely. His expression when he drives the couples home in the forest is very interesting. Although the chase after the accountant has a bit of comedy, it also reveals a pure sense of justice.</p>
<p>Beszgen's tractor driver can express the robustness and hard work of Soviet youth very well.</p>
<p>Radnina's Macalin is very lively, and her crying when she is scolded is quite sincere.</p>
<p>Other actors are also very successful.</p>
<p>As for music and singing, I can only say that I love it very much.</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Medicinal Water Stamps</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>"Where have the copper coins gone?"</p>
<p>On the tram, in the vegetable market, on the streets, throughout Shanghai, almost everyone can hear such questions. In fact, those who ask these questions, how can they not know where the copper coins have gone, so are they pretending to be stupid? Absolutely not! Because in order to take the tram, buy things, because of the lack of copper coins, all kinds of troubles have occurred, but there is no way to sanction those unscrupulous profiteers, "Where have the copper coins gone?" There is unlimited anger contained in this question.</p>
<p>That's right, because of the change, there was confusion in the market, and some stores even sacrificed their business. But what about daily necessities? For example, soy sauce shops, tobacco shops, these shops have a close relationship with the residents, and this close relationship is all change transactions, so everyone came up with a convenient way: some issued their own numbered vouchers, and some used stamps as change.</p>
<p>Although it is clear that this method is also very inconvenient, the vouchers issued by this store are only valid for this store, the stamps are easily soiled, and after the glue on the back melts, they are easy to stick to other things, and when they are transferred to each other, they will immediately turn into a piece of waste paper. However, after the stamps are generally used, they are indeed more convenient than vouchers. In order to avoid losses, they are all wrapped in transparent paper, and everyone is circulating them like auxiliary currency notes.</p>
<p>But even this little convenience aroused the attention of some "unscrupulous people." In the past two days, many used stamps have been found on the market. They washed the old stamps in a kind of medicinal water, the seal on the surface is more blurred, and then wrapped them in transparent paper, it is simply impossible to distinguish the true from the false. Moreover, the people who transfer them to each other are used as a substitute for auxiliary currency, and no one pays attention to the nature of the stamps, but when they really want to use them for sending letters, they find that the medicine-washed stamps are wrapped inside.</p>
<p>Although this is a small scam, they are taking this opportunity to "fish in troubled waters", and their harm will not be lighter than the profiteers who buy copper coins.</p>
<p>I hope everyone pays attention to this group of unscrupulous people who disrupt the market!</p>
<h3>Talking About Collecting Old Stamps</h3>
<p>— Sha Lumin</p>
<p>Some people like to collect old copper coins, all kinds of old, ancient, strange, and foreign copper coins are collected like treasures. Although it seems a bit eccentric to others; in fact, this is also a kind of "hobby", which is much better than wasteful ways of entertainment.</p>
<p>In addition, collecting ancient books, ancient bottles, ancient utensils... are not considered bad habits.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the interesting things about collecting old stamps: Not to mention foreign stamps, it is also very difficult to collect Chinese stamps completely, and you must pay attention to them anytime, anywhere. For example, there are several kinds of stamps in the previous Qing Dynasty. The date on the postmark is also very interesting, and it is calculated according to the lunar calendar. Remote provinces also add the words "limited to be affixed in a certain province", which is very difficult to collect. It is okay to collect closer ones such as Sichuan and Yunnan, but it is too difficult to collect more distant ones such as Xinjiang. There are also temporary commemorative stamps issued such as "National Government Unification Commemorative Stamps", "Sun Yat-sen's State Funeral Commemorative Stamps" and "President Tan Yankai Commemorative Stamps". Those who collect them should pay attention, otherwise they are very easy to collect, because the issuance amount of this kind of temporary commemorative stamp is very small, and they are often bought out by people who are quick to seize the opportunity.</p>
<p>There is a kind of Qing Dynasty stamps with the four red characters "Republic of China" printed on them. This kind is also valuable. The "New Life Movement Commemorative Stamps" and "The 40th Anniversary Commemorative Stamps of the Opening of the Chinese Post Office" are not only different in shape and color, but this difference represents the changes of the times. In addition, it seems easy to collect stamps commemorating revolutionary martyrs Huang Xing, Chen Yingshi, and Song Jiaoren, but it is difficult to collect a complete set.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of stamps that are abolished and no longer used, but before they are abolished, the post office always issues announcements. Now I will copy down the types of circulating stamps below: Ordinary stamps - those printed with President Sun Yat-sen's portrait include 2 cents, 5 cents, 15 cents, 25 cents, 1 yuan, 2 yuan, 5 yuan. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Deng Xianlie include half a cent and one and a half cents. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Chen Yingshi include 1 cent and 5 jiao. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Liao Zhongkai include 3 cents and 3 jiao. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Zhu Zhixin include 8 cents, 13 cents. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Song Jiaoren include 1 jiao and 17 fen. Those printed with the portrait of Martyr Huang Keqiang include 2 jiao and 4 jiao. As for airmail stamps, there are eight kinds including 15 cents, 25 cents, 3 jiao, 45 cents, 5 jiao, 6 jiao, 9 jiao, and 1 yuan, all printed with airplanes and the Great Wall.</p>
<p>The above stamps are just the currently circulating ones, and it can be seen that the number is large, so it is really not easy to collect Chinese stamps completely, not to mention the past abolished stamps.</p>
<p>The United States also issues a lot of stamps, and the colors are the most beautiful, clear, and very pleasing to the eye. Printed with images of Lincoln, Hoover, Washington, Roosevelt, etc. German stamps are printed very exquisitely and can reflect light. And most British stamps are the same, with a portrait of an emperor. Cuban and Mexican stamps are also beautiful and are portraits. As for the patterns of Czechoslovakian stamps, they are also very delicate, while Danish stamps and Italian stamps are unique.</p>
<p>In short, stamp collecting is also a specialized art, and it is also a kind of "hobby": the key is to pay attention to all kinds of old stamps anytime and anywhere and pay attention to the issuance of new stamps in the post office.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Red Powder Eliminates Hatred but Fails to Eliminate Karma, Green Window Talks About Love and Re-establishes a Good Relationship</p>
<p>At that time, Pan Peimei really had unspeakable grief, but she was not the kind of woman who would commit suicide, all women who get it do not. She only wanted to avenge Zhao Letian, and she would not lose her ambition to marry someone else. She couldn't agree to whatever her father wanted her to do. Who knew that after Zhao Qitian was injured and entered the hospital, in less than two years, Pan Peiying's father was assassinated and died. It turned out that at that time, Pan Peiying's father gradually became rich. He married a famous Shanghai dancer named Ling Xiaohua as his concubine. Unexpectedly, although this Ling Xiaohua was a dancer, she was a patriot. She was originally a young lady from a small family, and she could barely make ends meet. During the war, her hometown was occupied. Her mother and her sister were both raped, she was still young at that time, and fortunately escaped in the grave nest, and was not captured by the devil's hand. When she gradually grew older, this shame and grievance always gnawed at her heart, and she never forgot it. Because all the fields and houses were gone, she moved around and later became a dancer. But although she had ice and frost in her heart, she had a face like peaches and plums, so in less than a few months, she became very popular and very popular. At that time, there was a patriot who organized a secret society called something group. The characters in that group included men and women. Men were workers, hawkers, noble clerks, and humble servants. Women were prostitutes, dancers, young ladies, and factory girls. However, these characters were all young people, and there were no older people. Ling Xiaohua was also one of them, because her mother and sister were both raped and died, and she wanted revenge. One day, a dance guest took her to see a play. That day's play was exactly The Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty. When</p>
<h3>The Revival of Fudan's Drama Movement</h3>
<p>— Jingran</p>
<p>— Joint Performance by Two Groups to Raise Relief Funds</p>
<p>In the past, under the leadership of Professor Hong Shen, the "Fudan Drama Society" undeniably occupied an important position in the art scene of Shanghai—and even arguably the entire China—shining brightly and praised by all. Later, Hong left Fudan and went south to Guangdong, and the "Fudan Drama Society" ceased operation due to the lack of a leader!</p>
<p>Recently, the "Haiyan Literary Society" and the "Female Students' Association," two groups organized by some students of Fudan University, wanted to revive the declining Fudan drama movement. After more than three months of preparation, they were able to hold a small-scale joint performance at the Ningbo Native Place Association at 7:30 PM on Monday the 12th to raise funds for disaster relief. This is the first sound of the revival of Fudan's drama movement!</p>
<p>This time, a total of three one-act plays were staged:</p>
<p>(1) On the Upper Floor—This is a realistic comedy that addresses Shanghai's extremely serious housing problem. However, it seemed to be underplayed in the performance. The sins of the second landlord exploiting the third tenant were not fully exposed, giving the audience the feeling that the second landlord's wife was not so ruthless. In addition, the landlady's long "complaint" about rent increases made the audience feel that it was "understandable." Compared with reality, it cannot be denied that the whole play was loose and a failure.</p>
<p>(2) Annoying Things—This describes the ugliness of a pretentious woman and a cowardly man, revealing the ugliness of the upper class. In terms of performance: the dialogue of Mrs. Li Sheng, the female clerk, was not loud enough, giving the audience in the back rows the feeling of "watching a silent pantomime." The male lead, who was full of Ah Q characteristics, worked very hard, but was somewhat over the top.</p>
<p>(3) Dancer's Tears—This scene was arguably the most exciting and the most able to attract the audience. The story tells of a dancer, Manli, who is seduced by a dance patron, Xiao Chen, and loses her virginity. In order to preserve Xiao Chen's reputation, she has an abortion and becomes ill. She still dreams that Xiao Chen will marry her, but the response she gets is: "The young master has plenty of money. What does it matter if he spends some? There's no shortage of women to play with!" The merciless blow drives her mad. This scene was undoubtedly a success due to the proper handling of the director and the efforts of the actors, which made the plot more tense and tightly gripped the hearts of the audience! There is something to be happy about here!</p>
<p>This time, the joint performance of the two groups was inevitably simple in terms of scenery and props due to the stage limitations. And because the actors lacked experience, both the movements and dialogue were inevitably a bit too much like "acting." However, actors such as Bai Sha, Lu Lu, Vera, Gan Cao, and Mei Bo are all promising dramatic talents. (Charity Sale Donation)</p>
<h3>Record of Listening to Opera at the Golden Theater</h3>
<p>— Barking Sound</p>
<p>The Fuyuncheng Opera Troupe came to Shanghai for a large-scale performance for the second time. The author went to the Golden Theater on Sunday evening. When I took my seat, Yan Shishan's "Presenting Gold to the Emperor" was already coming to an end, followed by the full version of "Stealing the Imperial Horse." This play has been rarely performed in southern Yunnan in recent years, because there is no good martial clown. That night, Sheng Rong played Yang Dun, with both voice and appearance, from beginning to end, without the slightest carelessness, winning extremely good reviews from the audience. In the midst of the decline of the Jing role, he is truly a rare and valuable first-class talent. Gao Shenglin played Huang Tianba, with quite a bit of Xiaolou's style. Singing, recitation, and acting all imitated the Yang style, which is very gratifying. Ai Shiju's Zhu Guangzu was fluent in recitation and skilled in martial arts, especially adding color to the play. After the intermission, there was the full version of "Wulongyuan." Mao Shilai's Yan Xijiao appeared on stage in colorful attire, quite adhering to the typical Hua Dan style. Guan Shengxi's Song Jiang was also able to fulfill his role. In the Pingban segment where he suspects Yan Xijiao's thoughts, the Qin player mistakenly played the Up-phrase interlude instead of the Down-phrase interlude for the last sentence of the third phrase. Guan looked back at the stage at that time, but it had already been pulled out and could not be changed. Fortunately, Guan was quite calm and sang the sentence "Could it be that my mother beat and scolded you?" still singing it with the Down-phrase. This was not easy. However, when Shilai entered the door, he did not close the door, which seemed to be a small flaw. Because when he later pushed Song Jiang out the door, there was a movement of pulling the bolt to open the door. If he had to pull the bolt to open the door at this time, then he should have closed the door earlier. If he did not close the door earlier, then there was no need to pull the bolt to open the door at this time. This is a common problem for most actors performing this play, and it is not only Mao that is like this. Sha Shixin's Liu Tang started from writing the letter and continuously performed "Sitting in the Tower and Killing the Daughter-in-law," with the fire rising and shaking, with nothing to commend. Hanging the sign above Shenglin and Shengrong made Qiu and the two actors feel uneasy. After the capture, Shilai's circles under the lights were quite reasonable, but it was already 11:30, so he did not have time to go on stage and returned. (Charity Sale Donation)</p>

<h3>Talking about Chaozhou Opera</h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Chaozhou opera also had two or three troupes performing in Shanghai a few years ago. They had footprints in the Great China Empire, but the time was very short, only a few months. Because there are not many Chaozhou sojourners and natives, and most people in Shanghai do not read Chaozhou dialect, there are very few who go to watch, so they cannot perform for a long time. I remember that the earliest Chaozhou opera troupe to come to Shanghai was more than ten years ago, and the performance location was at the Xiaowu Stage on Shantou Road.</p>
<p>Now, the Chaozhou opera being performed at the Queen's Theater is the Lao San Zheng Shunxiang troupe, which is very prestigious in Shantou. When it was performed at the Great China Theater a few years ago, I also went to watch it several times. I am not from Chaozhou, but I have been mingling with Chaozhou people for many years. I feel that the troupe's costumes and makeup are better than other Chaozhou opera troupes, without being old-fashioned or vulgar. At that time, they were rehearsing Yue Wumu, and the performance was very sincere and considerate, and the roles were very neat. Now that the old lover has returned to Shanghai, I will definitely take time to appreciate it once. I wonder what level its art has progressed to now? However, the ticket prices set by the troupe are too expensive and cannot be popularized, so it cannot be a widespread Chaozhou opera audience, right? I remember that when the troupe performed at the Great China Theater a few years ago, the ticket prices were only 80 cents, 60 cents, and 40 cents.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chaozhou opera music, it is slightly similar to Cantonese opera, but its eight interludes are incomparably quiet, much better than Cantonese opera, and even more different from Beijing and Cantonese operas. The rhythm is played in a melodious manner, which is fascinating. As for the roles, both the young male and female roles are children aged 10 to 16 or 17, because they take their crisp voices. If they reach puberty, their voices change, they cannot play young male and female roles, and they become old male and female clowns. The period for these roles is only a few years, relying on their natural voices. It is not like Beijing opera, where the voice can be sustained for life through long-term training, so the combination of Chaozhou opera in this field is quite different from other dramas.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>It is a pity that Sun Yukun and Hou Xirui have fallen</p>
<p>In the present day when Yang (Xiaolou) and Yu (Zhenting) have passed away, and Lao Shang (Heyu) has retired, Sun Yukun should indeed be the first choice among the new Ping martial male roles who can combine the strengths of the Yu and Yang schools, and who have both voice and body. Yukun, whose stage name is Xiaozhenting, is now in his forties. He has learned the essence of Xiaolou and Zhenting. He has neither the fatigue of Yang's later years nor the vigor of Xiaomaobaodu. Especially for painted-face plays such as "Yanyang Tower," "Iron Dragon Mountain," "Golden Leopard," and "Farewell My Concubine," if he suddenly appears on stage without explaining in advance that he is Sun Yukun, just looking at his appearance, stage steps, starting point, etc., it is really possible to mix pearls and fish eyes and impersonate Yu and Yang. Moreover, his naturally thin and long face also imitates Xiaolou by wearing his helmet particularly far back, and the face frame when painting his face occupies a slightly larger area, and the forehead occupies a strong third of the entire face. This makes him appear more imposing, so Xiaolou's Xiang Yu has the spirit of "strength to uproot mountains and cover the world" as soon as he comes out. Zhou Yitui (Ruian)'s body is not short either, but when you look at Ding Yi, you ridicule him as Little Overlord. On the contrary, Sun Yukun is not as good as his appearance. This shows the difference between the two in learning Yang's essence and not.</p>
<p>The earliest two to learn Yang were Sun, Zhou, and Li (Wanchun). Zhou has a leg that is not very energetic, and is too clumsy and too fiery. Every time he pulls a movement, he simply grits his teeth and exerts twelve points of energy. Wanchun is small in stature, so short-fought plays are okay, but long-clad plays clearly show a small demeanor. At the same time, his problem is that his legs have no roots, as if he can't lift them up. Singing martial males rely entirely on the waist and legs. If Zhou and Li lack leg work, they have already lost the conditions that a martial male should have. No matter how many people support them, they will never become first-class martial males. Although Lao Shang (Heyu)'s voice and appearance are not as good as Xiaolou's, he has been lucky for many years just by relying on his leg work. He stands on the stage as if he is a nail nailed there. If his legs have roots, of course he will look old and good-looking no matter what posture he puts on. Sun Yukun's body and legs are more energetic than Zhou and Li. He also has a lot of mouth strength when he reads a few sentences, and he looks a bit like Xiaolou. Ten years ago, he was very famous for performing in Peiping. Later, he became very close with his classmate Cui, and at the same time he developed both black and white hobbies, so his body gradually deteriorated, and he took a perfunctory approach to acting. In recent years, he has been almost ignored. Not only do foreign ports not think of inviting him, but also not many people in the old capital invite him to teach him. —(36)—</p>

<p>(IV) Storytelling</p>
<p>After talking about "ballad singing," it seems that we cannot let go of "storytelling" without talking about it.</p>
<p>Storytelling does not use musical instruments, nor does it have a backing. The materials are mostly historical stories: after listening to several segments of ballad singing with soft strings and gentle voices, one must come to a segment of relatively exciting and generous storytelling to make adjustments.</p>
<p>Generally speaking: ballad singing is always soft, and storytelling is always hard; but there are also exceptions, such as Dahongpao in ballad singing and Wensuchen in storytelling.</p>
<h3>Sun Min Studies Cosmetic Surgery</h3>
<p>— Xinren</p>
<p>Regular Apprenticeship Ceremony Held</p>
<p>The suave actor Sun Min returned from Kunming in early spring and was immediately hired by Xinhua Company, signing a long-term contract. He has always been a good young man with a thirst for knowledge. Recently, he has become very interested in the career of cosmetic surgeons, which is developing quite rapidly. He is interested in all kinds of artificial cosmetic surgery, such as eyelid modification, sunken eye sockets, high nose surgery, wrinkle removal, and mole removal. In general, fashionable men and women in Burgeois Asia have their own needs, and it is also very beneficial in terms of makeup techniques. Last month, he specially asked someone to introduce him to Dr. Song Zibin of Shanghai Cosmetic Hospital and began to negotiate, expressing his intention to become an apprentice and learn the trade. According to Dr. Song, cosmetic surgery requires not only textbook knowledge, but also more practical experience, so he should often go there to practice in person. He also said: We might as well study together as friends, and there is no need to establish a teacher-student relationship. This is of course his humble words. After considering the results, Sun Min determined that going to practice after filming every day would not interfere with his job. After several continued consultations, he happily confirmed it the day before yesterday. At the same time, Sun Min also set up a banquet at the Kouyang Tea House on the 15th to hold an apprenticeship ceremony.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Tidbits</h3>
<p>Li Zilin, a new actor at the Grand Theatre, arrived in Shanghai on the Shengjing round at 1:00 PM today. The theatre decided the night before last to invite female impersonator Chen Wangjun to join at the same time as Li.</p>
<p>The Yifeng Drama Society at the Carlton Theatre rehearsed three volumes of Wensuchen after the play last night, so they rehearsed the 13th and 14th volumes of Tian Yuhua early the night before last.</p>
<p>Female impersonator Wang Xichun was originally scheduled to start filming the Wensuchen film on the 20th, but because of the Dragon Boat Festival, she had to perform day shows at the Carlton Theatre, which conflicted with the scheduled plan, so she announced a postponement, and the date was not determined.</p>

<h3>The Pigsty Fire at Eight Immortals Bridge</h3>
<p>Fires at Eight Immortals Bridge have been seen three times in ten days. Because there are many thatched huts in the area and the weather is extremely dry, a slight carelessness can easily lead to a fire. The Mixed Court has now ordered all thatched huts to be demolished within three days. The Fire God will have no way to incite violence. It is now known that the fire that burned the other day burned to death more than 530 pigs. Both sows and boars were reduced to ashes. Many pig herders lived there, and the pig pens were scattered. Because the fire spread quickly, the pigs staggered out but had no way out, so their flesh rotted and their skin burned, and they were piled on top of each other, all becoming ashes. An old glutton passed by and saw it, and exclaimed: "This is a wonderful roast pig!"</p>
<h3>Judge Lu's Magic</h3>
<p>Recently, because the weather has been dry for a long time, an altar was set up to pray for rain, which has already been reported in the previous newspaper. (Note: See this column, issue 54.) Judge Lu wrote talismans and performed magic in the altar, chanting incantations. He pointed his sword at the jars, and the water could follow the sword down. When he lifted the sword, the water also followed it up. He also gave the sword to the officials praying for rain, and pointed it at their jar of water, and it also went up and down. This is also a demonstration of Judge Lu's magic. But the rain still did not come, which is also strange.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Suzhou received a welcome rain yesterday, but rice prices did not fall after the rain. Today, rice merchants are quoting prices starting at $2.50 per load, up to $3.30 per load. High-quality white Chen rice costs $3.60 per stone, and broken rice costs $3.70 per stone. It is heard that the price of Jiangning Jian rice ranges from 1,800 to 2,200 cash. Because 30 miles of river south of Changzhou City have dried up, all traffic to and from that place must be by land. Rice is a heavy object, and it is difficult to load and unload. Moreover, half of the rivers within Changzhou City have also dried up, so rice prices in Suzhou cannot be quickly leveled.</p>
