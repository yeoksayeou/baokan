<p>（倫敦）　英政府以最近復文送交德政府後、尚未接到復文、英政府昨以希特勒來文與英國復文各一份送交波蘭外長柏克後、亦未接到波蘭政府復文、聞波蘭復文一二日內可到、衆料德政府亦必續有答復、據柏林消息、德國是否對於英國來文作書面答復＝現尚未定、消息靈通方面確信、德外長里賓特羅甫業已向英大使漢特森說明德國對於英國最近來文之反響、外交上接觸刻在繼續進行中、惟德國政界調、在過去廿四小時內、局勢愈臻嚴重、德國民衆現漸露不安之象、互以「神經戰「何時可停為問、（三十日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）　德國元首希特勒、昨日送達英國政府節略、內容如何、迄未公佈、此間各報、頃紛紛加以評論、晨報駐倫敦議員來電稱、希特勒元首即曾在節略內聲明、切望與英國成立持久的協定、亦即歐洲和平所賴以促使之協定、特德國於波蘭國所提出之要求、必須有以滿足之、「渠井應允擬定議事日程、將此項要求一一列入、然後據以與波蘭國直接磋商、但以波蘭國政府遣派代表團前往柏林進行游動條件、英國政府聞已將希特勒此種主張、通知波蘭國、並聲明接受與否、悉聽波蘭國自行决定、不擬施以何項壓力、質言之、英國政府僅表示希望願採取各項措置、以解除德波兩國間現行緊張局勢、如是而已」、巴黎迴聲報載稱「昨夜英國政府業以復文送往柏林、其內容聯僅說明現行爭議之和平解决方式、暨德波兩國直接談判之可能、英國因與波蘭國訂有互助協定、對於德波兩國各項爭議之解决方法、自未便詳細加以討論、藉免偏袒之嫌、是以任何方案可否接受、其權操踷波蘭國、英國外交之主要目標、亦惟造成一種打樁的環境、俾得以和平解决方案、替代下圖威脅而已、」</p>
<p>華沙　據華少驟報載稱、德國元首希特勒曾向波蘭國政府建議、請遣派全權代表前往柏林進行談判、政界人士頃加以說明云、希特勒元首日昨與英國大使漢德森爵士談話時、雖曾提出此項建議、但在致英國一座座節略內、並未談及此層、要之、波蘭政府未甞不可與德國進行談判、但必須以一種原則為基礎、此項基礎業由外交部長柏克陸軍總監斯米格里資上將迭次發表演說、予以說明、即　但澤市與德國合併事、未便予以接受、　波麥拉尼亞省割讓德國之議未便提付討論、　雙方談判、應在和平環境之下、根據相互原則進行、此外、某某方面則調、德波兩國可在下開兩種方式之中、任擇其一、進行談判、一即經由通常外交途徑、一即遣派代表、在某中立國境內進行談話、關於第二項方式、英國某報昨已建議、可在瑞典車京城舉行、但波國方面拒不作何表示、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）　此聞人士、因希特勒與張伯倫仍繼續交換牒文、故對時局頗樂觀、但自波蘭下總動員令消息傳來後、此種樂觀心理、業已大部份歸於消滅、皆恐希特勒對於此項繼續挑釁之手段、將不能再予以容忍也、現在義國各報對　氏和平工作、仍以頌揚、（三十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）　此間人士從論國際局勢、認為在最近廿四小時內、除波蘭於昨日頒佈總動員令外、別無重大變化、一般與論均調、英德兩車交換解决歐洲局勢意見、倘一日不中斷、則和戰問題一日不能獲得確切答案、意大利名記者蓋達頃在意大利在新聞報發表一文、略調、歐洲命運尚須再待數日、始可决定、現在英相張伯倫與德元首希特勒仍在賡續交換意見、商討解决方案、同時議相壘索里尼與德元首希特勒亦不斷保持接觸、思欲玉成英德交換意見後這解决方案云、（三十一日海通電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）　據法國半官方面宣稱、法國對於荷比兩國調停、極表歡迎、認為五强會議、較之以前大有可能、衆信現時苦難、厥為德國堅持必須波蘭先接受德國要求、然後再舉行五强會議、而英法則主張必須歐洲先實行復員軍隊之後、始能參加會議云、（三十一日海通電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）　蘇聯最高議會定於本日午後七時半開始討論德蘇兩國互不侵犯條約批准案、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　據官方宣布、德蘇兩國對於德波糾紛、現正互相商議、德外部喉舌外交通信報、因外傳柏林與莫斯科間已發生障碍、故特發表聲明、謂吾人對於德蘇互不侵犯協定如加以嚴密之研究、即可見該協定已於簽訂之日發生效力、該協定之內容、可表示蘇德兩國切望以相互關係置於持久基礎之上、并從事解決兩國各懸案、同時德國更根據該協定條款之規定、隨時以德波問題之最近發展及外交情形、通知蘇聯政府云、該報又稱、蘇聯官方通訊社所發蘇聯已加强其西部邊境駐兵之說、殊堪重視、由此可見蘇聯對於波蘭事、并非漫不注意、吾人勿忘一九一九年情形、波蘭問題不僅與德國有關、且與蘇聯互有關係也（三十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>希特勒遇難關　幾至寢食俱廢</h3>
<p>（柏林）　際此歐洲危機中、希特勒總理一星期來之睡眠、較任何人為少、自上星期四、德國外交部長里賓特洛甫由莫斯科返抵柏林後、希特勒總理每晚與親信會晤至深晚始止、每晚常召集正式會議至翌晨二時散會、會畢復興戈林上將及里賓特洛甫外長在私寓繼續會議、非至晨四五時不克就寢、每晨七時起身、飲牛奶一杯、餅乾數塊及少許水果後、即忽忽辦公、常於上午十時進第二次早餐、今則或因公務紛集遺忘、或延遲數小時、至於午晚兩餐、皆在官邸內食之、每次以水果等物、値此歐占後最緊張時局中、并不表示神經衰弱、面部表情及態度仍極鎮靜、但極端嚴重、發語湛少、為休養計、日在官邸花園內散步二次、每次約半小時、散步時常與戈林及里賓特洛甫二氏討論種切、每日與德國駐外外交代表通電話四五次、接近希特勒者聲稱、本星期談話中、希氏屬次表示、在此次危機中、仍能覓取和平解決方案、（三十一日美聯社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本之新內閣</h3>
<p>日本平沼內閣總辭職，阿部奉命組織繼任內閣；當消息初傳之時，新閣未成之際，五口人嘗掬至誠，述所期望，以促阿部注意者三，即所以爲阿部勗。迄今閱三日，其閣僚銓衡就緒，阿部旣袍笏登臺，并以首相兼外交之軍人姿態，發表施政綱要，刊如昨報。夫內閣爲國家行動之樞紐，日本爲遠束紛擾之源泉，則日閣更張，自未可等閑視之；於茲阿部內閣眉目依稀可辨之始，似不可無一言。</p>
<p>以三日來有關阿部內閣之種種見聞言之，具見其先天不足，後天失調、其不能有爲，絕無前途、可謂呱呱墜地即已註定運命可也。據德國之海通社稱：新閣員之遴選，新計畫之起草，軍部均將有重要決定權；又稱軍部要求多行動，少開會；又稱板垣仍擁最大潛力，對於前外相宇垣，廣田，前駐英大使吉田，前駐法大使佐藤，俱予排斥云。即此一端，可知阿部內閣猶是軍部「出張所」，其本體非於政治上有何權威力量，雖謂無魂靈無價値且無本體，亦無不可。至於任何國家任何內閣所必具之政策特徵，允不足以語於阿部內閣。彼爲阿部辯護者，謂自阿部而上溯平沼近衛乃至於廣田，實屬一脈相承，阿部政策至少猶爲近衛時代之政策也；日本之同盟社爲之宣傳最淺顯，其言曰：新內閣關於處理旣定事變之根本方策，無論如何不能更張；如前任近衛內閣當時雖去職，後繼者決未動搖，故今後之繼任內閣亦決不變更任何根本國策之旣定方針。其實所謂政策不變，方針不變，何以內閣再變三變而至四變？此乃政治原則所不通。退百步言之，竟然不變，亦即政策方針悉仍舊貫、則所謂組閣、所謂新內閣、太無意味，亦太可憐矣。若謂別有意味，不太可憐，是必所謂政策方針者，確能卓然屹立，繼任者得而步武後塵，發揚光大焉；顧今日之日本何似乎？吾人姑勿臚舉俯拾皆是之鐵證，以證明日本政策方針未能卓然屹立，但以平沼下野時所發表之辭職理由聲明書證之、便得了然。彼聲明書有數語云，『對於外交建國之途，呼籲世界之和平與文化等，曾不遺餘力屢决奏本皇上；』又云『因鑑於日本旣定之準備政策，在此局勢變更之下，須另擬妥善應付政策之樹立；』又云『國內之體制整頓，外交之機軸改動等，爲突破非常時局，轉換局面，及一新人心所當然者。』於是觀之，不但平沼內閣所定之政策，所行之方針，不得不變，根本有待另行擬訂；即超越內閣所定所行，且已上奏之於天皇，在日本臣民夙昔所不敢輕議更張者，亦因局勢轉換而有另行擬訂之必要。平沼即以「臣恐有貢聖恩；不堪負此重任」而去職，然則阿部所欲繼承不變之政策方針，固爲何物乎？要知有關日本政策方針之廣田聲明，近衛宣言等等，總之，日本歷代內閣言之行之於平沼下野之前者，旣以時過境遷而事實上俱成爲旣往之陳跡，抑且以平沼之辭職聲明書而在政治法理上爲之一筆勾銷。此一絕大變遷，應爲遠束問題中之歷史的紀錄，劃時代之堦段也。</p>
<p>惟其如此，繼平沼而任首相者，理宜有其絕大經綸。絕大手筆以創造日本政策方針之新生命矣；顧乃爲之辯護，爲之宣傳者，於一脈相承，決不變更之外，未能置一辭。更以察之阿部發表之施政綱要，莫謂不能比擬世界各國任何政家登台之開塲白，即以視日本歷代新閣所標揭者，雖謂空前之貧弱空虛，亦不爲過。此在日人，非不知之；彼邦各報對新閣無好評，宜其然也。然則阿部內閣領導下之日本將何所表演，何所作爲乎？曰在徬徨之中，摸索之中，追求之中。阿部所謂「對於理解日本立塲，不惜協力之國，自當作爲友邦，共同協力；對於不然之國則應以斷然決心對付之」，此暴露其徬徨而不知何所得而摸索追求。咋日同盟社東京電，猶謂「在平沼內閣之對歐政策取銷之後，應以新構想，從速確立帝國外交力針，但並不採取孤立政策」云、是亦毫無目標之追求之說也。</p>

<h3>日本的海軍難題</h3>
<p>日本的陸軍，在中日戰事未發生以前，大家都側目而視，認爲「攻無不克」「銳不可當」的勁旅。但經試騐之後，才知道沒有什麼了不得。日本的海軍，雖在俄日戰爭中出過風頭，但現在的情形，已和當年大不相同。它從未和現代海軍强國較過身手，是吾也和陸軍一樣，徒有虛名，無從得知，而英首相張伯倫却很怕它作祟，所以對東京談話，自稱「在遠東除對日本屈服外，沒有辦法。」這是眞心話呢，還是實行他的綏靖政策的託詞呢，無人能下斷語。下文是澳洲新南威爾斯州最高法院的律師歐文氏所著，他平日研究防務問題，不少著述，讀之可以知道日本海軍究有多大能力。本載於澳洲國際事務研究會六七月份合刊，由密勒氏評論報轉錄，今把它譯出，貢獻給留心時事的讀者。………編者</p>
<p>對於太平洋中海軍問題，經騐不足的批評家和許多軍界人士，常忽略了該區中大戰時日木所遇難題的重大性。目下對於日本應付範圍有限的戰爭，和應付跟她的海上貿易或她的領土，並無大碍的戰爭，大可檢討一番。自純軍事觀點說來，日軍在中國應付着困難的戰爭，大體上還算有效果，倘若這些日軍對一個或幾個一等强國作戰，那情勢便耍完全不同了，本文所述，就是日本事務的這一方面。</p>
<p>澳人對於經騐不足，而沒有在多方研究這問題的批評家所抱的失敗主義見解，微有接受的傾向，這種見解，有在危急時，影響防務政策的嚴重危險。</p>
<p>日本供給本國民衆的食糧，所產不少，但是煤。油。橡皮·和鐵等重要原料，必須輸入。若要維持內部經濟的穩定狀態，須在承平時和戰時力求輸出貿易，繼續而不停頓。上决大戰時，英國所遇的許多難題，如今日本也遇到，而在日本或將參加的太平洋區任何大戰中，這些難題將更爲重大。顯然的，日本在戰時必須維持她對亞洲大陸的海上貿易，且自日本觀點而論，切望能維持她對東印度•亞洲東南。諸部，和南北美的貿易。日本評論家石丸曾說及一九三五年，日本貿易所散佈的海路如下…</p>
<p>（一）往亞洲大陸，香港以北………百分之一九</p>
<p>（二）往亞洲大陸，香港以南（連香港在內）百分之一八（三）往東印度，菲島和大洋洲……百分之一一·五</p>
<p>（四）往南北美……百分之三三</p>
<p>（五）其他各地（取道新加坡………百分之一八•五</p>
<p>共計百分之百</p>
<p>石丸又說，對英作戰時，這貿易的百分之四十八將被截斷，但經過太平洋對美，或是對亞陸北部的貿易並不在這百分之四十八中。</p>
<p>世界大戰時，英國一旦解決了海外比較無多的敵方襲擊艦後，便能在狹海中把敵艦關住，使它們不能駛出。至於日木地位便相反了，牠的貿易或將在根據地數千哩外遭攻擊。現時誰都不會想像日本對於襲擊其商業的敵艦每一處可能的根據地，能够掃除一空，或加以封鎖，允其是須憶及更新式的巡洋艦，幾乎在世界大戰時所夢想不到的長航力。阿萊蘇薩式的英國巡洋艦具有將近一萬二千哩的續航力。</p>
<p>再，今日易受攻擊的海路，比起世界大戰時易受襲擊的海路更長得不能測度，今舉其距離如下：</p>
<p>（一）日本到朝鮮……一二〇哩</p>
<p>（二）日本到上海……四七〇哩</p>
<p>（三）日本到舊金山四七六〇哩</p>
<p>（四）日本到墨西哥六九五〇哩</p>
<p>日本若竟對具有巨大襲擊力的敵國作戰，那末，這些海路都要時遭襲擊，只能用大規模的抵抗計畫才能應付。巡邏制度使日本海軍力的比較的大部份不能動員，護送制度又費用甚巨，且多妨碍，也許辦不到，因爲日本缺少適於駛行長距離的護送艦。（須用巨數巡洋艦才行）當這些需要一經考慮時，便能覺得日方在離日幾千哩外，竭力實行大規模侵犯，一面叉要維持牠生存攸關的貿易海路時所將遇到的巨大困難。遠征軍離開根據地，不僅在發動作戰，且在維持給養和援軍上，每添百哩，便須更多的海軍護送艦。據海軍權威估計，配備齊全的軍隊兩師所需的商船運輸須達三十萬噸之多。</p>
<p>所以日本的靴題，是（一）維持其海（上）貿易到足使其國內和戰爭工業得到必要供給品的程度、（二）支持她願派往海外遠處的遠征軍。（三）爲維持國內經濟的穩定起見而維持她的出口貿易。這些目的，都需要大量海軍，然而不必以戰鬥艦隊的形式集中實力。（未完）</p>

<h3>稅收強迫行使僞券　中行已堅決拒絕　必要時將撤退收稅人員　僞「監督」竟定今日實行</h3>
<p>事實上係增加關稅中外一致重視</p>
<p>重慶　此間當局聞上海江海關發出關稅用「華興銀行」鈔票繳付之通告、深為訝異、而英國外交使節團亦未獲關於此事之情報、聞財政部現請英國外交使節團轉向英大使詳詢一切、聞上海關通告中有「奉政府訓令」一語、中政府對此、大為不解、因中政府從未發出此種訓令也、中國當局現極重視此事、欲亟盼英大使之答復、上海淪陷之後、江海關被迫易識稅收被截、存入正金銀行、今「江海關李監督」奉令强迫、自九月一日起稅收、以「華興券」為折合標準、羅稅務司昨晚截止尚未發實施公告、中央銀行稅收處已堅決拒絕、必要時撤退收稅人員、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>稅收委託中央銀行江海關一切稅收、向委託中央銀行代收，訂有委託合同、由中央銀行派員、設立江海關中央銀行收稅處、收得之款、依照合同、解繳稅務司、進出口稅以及其他各項稅收、均以海關金爲單位、每日由中央銀行公告法幣折合海關金價格、例如昨日爲法幣二元五五六、折合海關金一元、是項計算、係根據倫敦純金行市折合、自上海不幸淪陷後、中央銀行仍依照合同、辦理稅收事宜、收得之稅、照常解繳稅務司、</p>
<p>強迫收受華興僞劵所謂之「維新政府」、爲推行「華興券」起見、命令「江海關監督」李建南、企圖强迫江海關、於九月一日起收受「華興券」、辦法係對於江海關進出口稅以及其他各項稅收、概以「華興券」爲標準、凡進口稅及附捐以關金征收者、亦概以「華興券」折合、其以法幣繳納者、應任照「江海關監督公署」每日牌不公佈之折算率折合、李建南巳通知稅務司羅福德、迫令於九月一日起實行、</p>
<p>日稅務司接受實行江海關額外日籍稅務司小山田晃一、已接受監督李建南之通知、擬凖於九月一日起實行、聞其辦法、即以前一海關金元等於法幣若干、以後即一海關金元等於「華興券」若干、如以法幣繳納必須事前、依照「江海關監督公署」之公佈折合價格計算、海關金仍根據倫敦純金計算、「華興劵」以英匯六便士折合、法幣則依照外匯黑市折合、事實上故意抑低法幣價値、變相的增加稅收、</p>
<p>中央銀行決定拒絕中央銀行江海關收稅處、設三馬路外灘江海關內、並設有駐郵政總局辦事處、及駐江海關碼頭辦事處、江海關內之收稅處、專收進出口貨物及附捐稅等、郵局辦事處專收郵包稅、碼頭辦事處專收行李稅、自受江海關委託收稅、迄今已十一年矣、設有收稅處主任一人、辦事人員總的有一百餘人、聞對於收受「華興券」事、決予拒絕、但至昨晚五時截止、並未接到稅務司羅福德之任何通知、</p>
<p>海關四週戒備森嚴江海關昨晨起戒備森嚴、外灘及三馬路四川路之四週、駐有租界當局之探捕、中央銀行收稅處有該關之水上巡捕、其中有許多係日籍、新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、中央銀行上海分行、在未接江海關羅稅務司之通知以前、不願表示任何意見、惟　將外傳之情形、電重慶總行請示、但對「華興劵」無論如何、決予拒絕、如果强迫收受、惟有將收稅處人員撤退、</p>
<p>羅稅務司折衷辦法又新聲社記者昨日數次往訪江海關某高級華員、據談　收受「華興券」、將於九月一日起實行、屆時由江海關佈告週知云云、但至昨日下午五時截止、尚未見江海關稅務司之正式通告、所以今日是吾實行、已成疑問、並聞英籍之稅務司羅福德、正在考慮之中、擬定一折衷辦法、使中央銀行之收稅、不致發生間題、因是項收稅人員、均係專家、非普通人員所可負此重任、</p>
<p>中外商人一致重視關於華興券之行使、公共租界及法租界內中外銀行及商店公司行號、一致拒絕收受、所以中外商人對江海關之收受「華興劵」頗為重視、並認為如果江海關實行、直接爲推行「華興券一、間接爲變相之增加稅收、惟對「江海關李監督」之佈告實行、並不重視、現重視者爲江海關稅務司之公告、因至目前爲截止、未見稅務司之正式佈告、故未有表示、但對是項辦法、認爲影響英美等商人之利益、</p>
<p>外國貿易甚為不快英文大美晚報云、南京「維新政府」委任之「江海關監督」李建南、今（三十一日）晨頒布第四號新布告、自明日（一日）起、將本埠進出口稅增高什五左右、上海之外國貿易、對此甚爲不快、且頗震驚、自明日起、以關金券繳納關稅、不復接受、而一切關稅等收入、均須以「虹口幣」或法幣繳納、惟以「虹口幣」</p>
<p>虛偽的英匯率六便士為基礎、其意即謂以六便士之價格接受華興幣、而對法幣僅照目前的四便士之公開市價接受、故海關折合率、爲華興幣百元等於法幣一百五十元、金單位現僅保留作爲計算之方法、但不復爲繳稅之居間物矣、海關頒此佈告後、不僅接受「虹口幣」繳納關稅、抑且</p>
<p>法幣合金單位之價值、亦減低三分之一左右、自明日起、進出口商以法幣繳關稅、將較本月所繳者增加什五、此種手段、不啻將關稅增加什五、而予上海外國貿易以另一重夫打擊、進口貿易近因法幣跌價、已大受損失、而使多種商業</p>
<p>完全陷於停頓對於關稅增加什五、所受打擊尤重、南京「維新政府」顯圖增加收入、而定此計劃、此外、且圖使「虹口幣」在滬成爲付款之居間物、猶憶本埠日當局、日方招待新聞記者席上之發言人以及華興銀行經理會一再吾認欲使華興幣升入上海海關貨幣之列、又據字林報云、以華興銀行紙幣繳付關稅、今已成為事實據正式宣布、自明日起、（一日）一以關金券繳關稅者、不予接受、而須以華興幣或標準幣繳納一切關稅」、此處所稱「標準幣」者、即重慶所發行的紙幣之謂、其市價旣較華興幣的低兩便士、故</p>

<p>春秋改善小學敎員遇意見書　　編輯先生：　　上海社會生活日趨昂貴，一般薪水階級都已酌加或給津貼，而敎育界却選沒有什麼舉動，尤其是小學敎育界，有些校長竟然利用所謂「非常時期」，把敎員薪水儘可能的减低，由於小學敎師的過剩，就不怕僱不到更廉價的敎師。和戰前比較一下，敎師待遇反較低劣，往往一個月辛勤所得，只能勉强維持一個人最低限度的生活，而工作的繁重，當然是很平常的現象。往常，每週每位敎師大的擔任一千一二百分鐘，而現在郤有的敎師擔任到一千五百分鐘以上。這一點亦未嘗不是變相的待遇低劣。可是學校方面學費的收入，比較以前郤增加了不少；而支出上反較以前减少，所以我們的意思，認爲要提高敎師待遇，不一定耍增加學費，只要校長能熱忱地注意到敎師的生活，一定是有辦法的。　　譬如，敎師薪水，一學期應作六個月計算。學校經費公開，以打破彼此間生活的隔閡。開展學校間，敎師間，校長教員間的統一戰綫。　　近來有許多開明的小學校長，他們已自動地加了敎薪，這一點是很値得大說而特說的，校長能够這樣熱沈的對待敎員，使敎師的心目中拋開了生活的問題而專心於敎學，這於整個的國家社會都有裨益的。　　有許多經濟困難的學校，敎師應常諒解學校的實在景况，教師與校長縝密合作，爲兒童敎育服務。我們相信一個實在把他精力獻給敎育的敎師，一定能够採行的。實在一學期收入不够的學校，當然還希望社會人士加以援助　近來市上很謠傳着上海敎育界變質的消息。但是這謠傳是怎樣起來的呢？這倒很値得研究一下的。　　敎師們一向因受生活的鞭策，擔着工作的重荷，就很少有機會來把工作同志聯系起來，每一個敎育界的集會，如果沒有特種原因—如改選，政府機關特定的學術講座等—到會的人是不會多的。團結在整個敎育界里，可說是渙散得很，更由於敎師物質生活的低劣，所以一部分敎師就這樣容易被人利用。我們說這些話，並不是說上海的敎育界一點沒有組織，組織原是有的，不過還不够堅强。　　所以我們這里要提出的口號，是：在提高敎師待遇下，學校與學校間，敎師與敎師間，敎師与校長间，共同聯系起來，組成「敎育的堡畾」！李偉明　周述谋　嚴挹馨　樂士皂　陳緩　華珍　勞鷹　陳震華　朱靜倫　周偉　鄭企省　郭增　莊鶴嗚　姜劍鴛　方筠吳琬貞上天西買淚詞（續）  王一之　　行空高軌與雲平，　　穴地雷車日夜聲，　　七十一街忙展足，　　轆轤心事許飛瓊。　　行空高軌（elevated　rallwav）與地道雷車（subway），乃世界第一名城紐約市之交通上兩大建設。紐的婦人戒獨行，民四乙卯秋之某一夕，予共茂漪，自七十二街口之地道車站登車，茂速予遲，車門自動憂然閉，稍縱即逝之頃，致予繞站狂奔，厥後茂漪先在下一站之九十六道口下車，予始趕乘後到之車追及之。　　五里山塘萬頃湖，　　水鄉淸趣憶莼鱸，　　幾生重到江南住，　　冶色韶光共一圖。　　茂漪心戀江南之勝，英甫兄鳳起自天津庽書，中有無錫五里長街之風景葉書，出自徐永清淸手筆，親之以吻，愛之弗釋。　　遊子天涯日暮心，　　寒衣刀剪白雲深，　　從知粲笑眞良藥，　　越海車嘗媲萬金。　　民六丁卯一月十七日，承先岳母端木夫人遠寄寒衣，郵包甫啟，茂病忽愈。　　機絲弄影天孫巧，　　花蔓投鬚玉蝶嬉，　　安得織絨衫滿疊，　　為渠留愛到煢嫠。　　茂治事敏迅，每日自校返寓之電車中，復喜利用餘晷，挑織絨綫杉，予適乘另一電車，迎面對駛而過，瞥見絨綫舒展閒笑容可掬之神情，直同弄影之猫與穿花之蝶，愛護之念，油然以生。方今舉世多難胞，予恨不能取億兆絨衫，盡繼茂漪之遺容以爲贈也。　　小園花發晚風輕，　　百變春光幾度晴，　　惆悵東籬一株　，　　無休天地有涯生。　　坡老惆悵東籬一株雪之淸明絕句，茂漪慨然誦之，若目知其不永年者。民七戊午之四月十八日，予二人以將遠別，同遊華府之石磴園（StantonPark）園中有樹，遠望一白若梨花，茂漪往復盤桓，若有無窮感慨。　　一別華都淚萬行，　　雙棲海燕悵空梁，　　靈臺喜阜行吟地，　　陵谷忽忽草自蒼。　　詩壇巨子江亢虎，嘗比美國議會前之池臺爲靈臺靈沼，而居美京華府西北方之喜阜術（Mt.　Pleasant　Street），則予兩人旅美四年間棲息遠九閱月有半之故巢也。　　鳴機異籟因風遠。　　赴壑在潮入夜淸，　　明月驪珠爲買淚，　　悔敎交臂失名城。　　民七戊午四月三十夕，茂漪離華府北行，丑初停車紐的站，各種車聲，遙聞返響。時當靜夜，直如東海潮來，茂漪忽放聲大哭，若其潛識之作用，早知今生不復履紐的，今生不復共予老友屠楚漁君一唔者　　高屯（Groton）學圃暢春機　　陌上鈿車四牡肥，　　身被（Massachusetts）侔丘文化雨，　　驛書遙伴隴雲飛。　　侔丘省爲美國東部敎育與文化之中心，茂漪曾肄業於省境之高屯。　　故行政院長譚延關氏之女公子譚淑女士書法雨過天青  包天笑　　第十五回　海外豓聞忽迎桃葉　火中奇景竟粲蓮花　　原來成功從雲梯上爬到了五層樓時，他是從前來過好幾回，知道愛體絲上房間是在那裏的。他知道愛麗絲有聞讀書室，讀書室隔壁便是她的臥空。他就心愛麗絲也許不在屋子裏，也許東奔西竄的在那裏找出路；也許跌暈在那裏了；這可有些麻煩。這樣的一座大樓，要找到那樣一位驚惶失擠的人，又在這火燒眉毛的時候，可不把人急死了。此刻他從救火雲梯上認定了愛麗絲的屋子，爬到她玻璃窗的外面一張，却見她跪在地上，似雪白的一堆東西。認淸了是愛麗絲，他便抱了她就定。常他從　梯上爬下來時，地下的人，也都注目他了。現在他抱了愛麗絲走到窗前，地下的人，見抱了一個人出來，又是抱了一個女人。早已一陣拍手，齊聲喝釆。地下張着網，雲梯也移近過來，讓成功一步一步的走下去。愛麗絲這時也微微睜開眼睛，已認淸救她的是中國學生成功了。這樣的高梯上，抱了一個人走下去，不免有些膽戰心驚。因爲心中有些怯，愛麗絲把成功的頭頸，勾得愈加牢牢的了，好似就是跌下去跌死了，也是兩人死在一塊兒。直到走到雲梯的最後一級，愛太太已等好在那裏，一把摟住，拼命的接吻。口中寶貝心肝，呌個不停，接吻接得忘其所以把成功的臉上，額上，也亂親上陣了。這時母親的眼淚，和女兒的眼淚，也黏在一片，而母女的眼淚，也有黏上成功臉上去的。後來調查出這一次火災，是三層樓上有兩個小孩子，因爲他們的媽媽出去了，留兩個孩子在屋裏。這兩個孩子，忽然因爲肚子餓了，用火酒爐子燒點心吃。誰知一個不小心，火酒瓶子打翻，在爐子上着了火，便闖出大禍來。幸虧這兩個孩子逃得快，還不曾燒死，其他各層樓上的人，也因爲辰光還早　沒有傷亡的人。却幾乎把這位美麗的愛麗絲小姐，做了火中蓮花。大概中國的月下老入，因爲年紀老了，不願出洋，把這件姻綠簿上的事，拜託了法蘭西的祝融氏。祝融氏拍着胸脯答應了，小試詭計，趁着大家去聽音樂會的當兒，放一把火，將一對亞男歐女，紅絲繋足，使他們有情人成成眷屬了。（一七六）顚倒衆生  白華　“Naughty　But　Nice”　　我首先要介紹一位演員，可是不是所謂銀壇允物的唔」女郎安秀麗丹，而是男角狄克鮑惠爾。狄克鮑惠爾過去是歌唱演員，他演過很多歌舞片，可是在人才輩出的好萊塢，他的這方面的發展也有限得很，去年在南京大戲院映過的一部片子（片名一記不起來了），他已經放棄了歌唱角色的扮演，而獲得相當的成就。這部新作「顚倒衆生」，他又一反輕挑浮滑的恣態，而飾演一個拘謹持重的昔樂敎授。這角色又證明了他的演技的成功。如時常移下他的眼鏡，又戴上，不時微微地搖頭…等等動作，都能狀出一個固執而專心於昔樂者的神情。舉幾塲戲來說，則如：抵紐的姑家瑪達家，聽見她的賓客們的演奏時下流行歌曲而厭惡；他的歌曲售於出版家克拉克，由歌女齊爾黛主唱，他在家中廣邀親朋，在無綫電中聆聽的時候，他的得意之狀，但是聽到將他的交響曲改爲流行歌曲時，他的憤恨，面部表情和心理狀態的交織都能恰如一個敎授的身份。即是醉後和齊爾黛起舞，也並不過火。狄克鮑惠爾演這個角色的成功，是値得特別稱崇的。　　一個優秀與低能的導演能够決定一個演員的成敗，「顚倒衆生」是得到了一個强有力的證明。在這個戲中，每一個出塲人物，在導演者精心的彫琢之下。都付與了每一個明顯的性格，更因爲是喜劇，利用每一個誇大的，特殊的動作而使之典型化。譬如寫三位固執的老姑母，利用快對白，和一致的急促行動；瑪達的任性妄爲及僕人的沒有禮貌，利用屢次的屈了手指在唇間作口哨等等。　　導演者處理喜劇的圓熟的藝術手婉更是値得那些低能的導演們學習的。在古典音樂與流行歌曲的氛圍中，他自始至終控制着觀衆的情緒，而每塲戲的輕快活潑，又使觀衆沉浸在大聲的轟笑中。織接的明爽緊凑，尤是餘事。　　至於劇本，是寫古典音樂及流行歌曲一派音樂家的爭執，不過暴露好萊塢商人的唯利是圍，不惜借重女色爲誘，剽竊藝人的心血作爲自己的利潤，也是可取的。</p>

<p>游藝界「花濺淚」重演感言（上）  于伶　　疾風急雨中，上海劇藝社友人涉水來訪，商量重演「花濺淚」。談及劇藝社近來種種困難情形時，我雖非「花」也幾乎「濺淚」，為之默然憮然。　　送客回來，孤燈雨窗，百感交集，握管神往，久久不能下筆。　　記得「花濺淚」寫成于有愉快的過程中，去冬上演于身勞心疲，繼以病倒的軟弱的心情下，接着第二三次在新光戲院演出，第四冷飲在黃金大戲院義賣，都是斬頭截脚，只演兩幕，也感着殊不愉快，想不到今次重演時，劇藝社又是在不大愉快的情况內。　　「花濺淚」，這不愉快的象徵！是由于「感時花濺淚，恨別鳥驚心」這杜詩根本就是千古的不祥呢？還是這孤島受難的演劇運動，不到天明就是很難有愉快的時與事呢？我雖然對人常常失望，對事永不悲觀，可是今晚，由「花濺淚」的遭遇所聯想引起的情緒，縱然生性熱情，也並不怎樣熱烈得起來了！　　自然，「過去是熱忱推動着往前幹，近來是理知支配着做下去。」這是去年「花濺淚」首次公演時，自己寫下的話，所以今晚這里所謂情緒並不怎樣熱烈，不能說是我就此不要「花濺淚」這自己生養的癩痢頭兒子，更不是說要上海劇藝社諸友人放棄「花濺淚」的重演。我知道過去每次的不愉快，多因為劇社遭遇着可怕的困難，友人們也更知道我是寗願自己不愉快，而願幫着劇社克復或度過它當前的難關的。例如第二三次的演出，是劇藝社排練好了的劇本，不能通過上演，臨時旣調不轉劇目，新光戲院星期早塲的時間又不可能演出四幕，于是就再度斬頭截脚地縮成二幕來救急了。（原來五幕，第一次也只能演四幕）第四次是互助劇團的舞女姊妹們排演的，她們一則因為能演話劇的姊妹不夠多，二則限于演出的時間不能長，長則妨害伴舞時刻，有關生活；所以在導演藍蘭小姐的商量下，我也就同意了。何况參加的是聯合義賣性質，演出是以救難為目的！那末，一再斬頭截脚，支割劇本，在我即使並不愉快，也怎好阻止呢？談談大書  嚴成熙　　大書一股勁，小書一段情。可見大書全憑一個勁字。然而開門見山，沒有彈唱可以假借，因之也就不易計好，每聞說大書者謂吃力不討好；這固然是大書的厄運，其實大書多為慷慨激昂的故事，上海正需要有勁的大書呢！　　說大書要使聽衆聽了發生興趣，不感到像說敎或背書，這並不是一件易事。大槪說者需要衷氣足（就是有勁，並非浮燥），有學識上的修養，書路淸楚，情節動人，起角活現，面部有表情，嗓音宏亮，再加些精警的噱頭，務令　衆人勝出神就很好了。但備此全能的說大書者現在並不多，如黃兆麟，楊蓮靑等已為此中上乘，可知大書確實不易說。　　聽書無非聽聽噱頭笑笑，但也不妨讓有力的故事把你將泯沒的生氣提起來，或發一個會心的微笑，處於今日的上海，這似乎比較小書更有意思些建議賑務當局　舉行麒派大會串  知白　　最近半年來，北平劇壇，曾經數度舉行，「丑角大會串」，「凈角大會串」，譬如丑角大會串吧，像蕭長華慈瑞泉馬富祿葉盛章曹二庚茹富蕙等著名的小丑，一槪參加，每人演唱一　。（葉盛章壓台）至於凈角大會串呢，也是如此。北國凈角名伶，如郝壽臣侯喜瑞金少山劉連樂裘盛戎李春恒等，都一綱打凈，（凈角大會串向出金少山壓台）這不但是空前盛舉，而且生面別開，所以每次公演，轟動九城，盛極一時。　　因為北平劇壇，上海的名伶，雖亦有多多少少，但是因為丑角人才，和凈角人才的寥落，要像北平一樣的來一下會串，事實上是不可能的一件事。（就是可能也難號召）不過除掉丑角和凈角的會串以外，上海劇壇可以仿效故都的榜樣，舉行一次麒派大會串。　　麒派在上海風行一時，而且人才濟濟，演出定有號召，現在姑且替這個會串，擬定戲碼如左：　　李如春　（馬義）　九更天　　徐鴻培　（徐策）　跑城　　楊寳童　（吳漢）　斬經堂　　王椿柏　（薛禮）　鳳凰山　　徐鴻培　（劉邦）　　高百歲　（項羽）　門　　周信芳　（范增）　鴻　　陳鶴峯　（張良）　宴　　李如春　（項伯）　　陳鶴峯　（薛平貴）　別窰　　高百歲　（鄒應龍）　打嚴嵩　　王椿柏　（韓信）　韓　　周信芳　（蕭何）　追　　楊寳童　（劉邦）　信　　上面的戲碼，可以稱得上「精彩」字，照角色論，「鴻門宴」可以壓台，不過信芳的「追韓信」，向來　台，所以把「鴻門宴」排在前面。因為「鴻門宴」的項羽，非百歲不可，所以「追韓信」的韓信，不用百歲，而用椿柏。百歲鶴峯與信芳合演的「追韓信」。當年老天蟾時代，不時看見，與椿柏寳童合演「追韓信」，還是第一遭，反而覺得新鮮。「鴻門宴」劇中之范增，非常重要，信芳屢欲一演范增，而未如願，且范增之個性，頗難描慕，餘子皆不克勝任，不如派　信芳。鶴峯官演小生戲，演范增欠佳，演張良必能恰到好處也。以上的戲碼，能演六個半鐘頭，至七小時，黎園公會，以此作為會戲亦可，但我的意思，最好賬務當局，能把這理想成為事實，將麒派大會串，作為救濟難民的義務戲，我想收效必廣，成績一定可觀。「安康」別解  澹然　　天虛我生老先生的多才多藝，我們都是知道的。最近他為「安康」作考證，自然是言之有物，非嚮壁虛造者可比。不過據我所知道的，「安康」二字還有一種別的解釋。　　十多年前，我在杭州作事時，有一天，和亡友王君在皮市巷走過，看見一家的門上，貼着「安康承接處」一張紅紙招貼。我就問王君，這是什麽意思。王君是老杭州，（他祖上是蒙古人，已住杭州八代，所以我總笑　他為「王八代」。）而且又是博古通今的才子，我以為他總是知道的，所以我問他。果然，他不但知道，而且他還是以「安康」為副業的。據王君說，這「安康」二字，不過是「灘簧」二字的轉音。「安」與「灘」同韻，「康」與「簧」同韻。灘簧先生（杭州人稱唱灘簧者為先生，所以其中頗有眞正「先生」人物在內。）認為灘簧二字不雅，所以另外給牠一個別名，按着一般名稱可以用雙聲或疊韻的字來代表之例，（此例極多，下流社會中尤為通行，上流社會中則可以將淸初傳靑主以「汀萌」切「天明」來戲弄顧亭林為例。）所以他們就用了「安康」。實在的意思是用此二字的聲音，並非用此二字的意義。最初只是說這「安康」二字的聲音，來代表「灘簧」，久而久之才寫成這「安康」二字。　　王君本是官家子弟，革命後，家道中落，又生性貪懶好酒，無以為生，就拜了正始社的某「先生」，正式下海為「先生」。我想他的話是有些可靠的吧。　　此外，灘簧也不但獨行於杭州，各地都有，如說是文天祥的「台黃」轉音，那末又何以解釋各地的灘簧呢？至於灘簧的眞正起源，早有人考證過，我也就不必辭　了。言慧珠化裝  （紹）娛樂不忘救難　慈善伴舞大會素描  波音　　上海難民救濟協會舞塲組勸委會因鑒於米價飛漲，難民給養困難，特發起舉辦慈善舞競賽大會，借重全市舞小姐的力量來募集一筆給養經費。蒙各舞廳當局暨全體舞星的熱烈贊助，「慈善伴舞大會」終於在二十九日下午五時首先在雲裳舞廳開始舉行了。　　慈善伴舞大會的陣容，是相當堅挺的，除由協會理事長虞洽卿先生揭幕，影星陳雲裳小姐剪綵外，並由白虹梅熹韓蘭要殷秀岑劉繼羣章志直洪警鈴等各位明星表演精彩節目，該廳全休舞星均參加　務伴舞　　袁履登林康侯江一平幾位先生首先進入了會塲後，接着張善琨陪同陳雲裳黎明暉兩位小姐也出現於舞廳，來賓均一致鼓掌，報以熱烈的歡迎，虞洽老隨後趕到，於是在爵士音樂旋律聲中舉行了開幕的儀式，虞氏並親致簡單的演詞，陳雲裳小姐以笑容可掬的姿態行了剪綵禮，慈善伴舞隨即宣吿開始，來賓紛紛下海婆娑起舞，在娛樂不忘救難的口號下，覺得今天的跳舞，更具着深長的意義。　　値得稱頌的是舞業舞女聯誼社的幾們小姐，她們見義勇為熱心為善，情願犧牲了自己茶舞的營業，冒了大風雨，很早的便到塲了。　　伴舞開始了不久，麥克風裏突然發出驚人的報吿，有一位王石屛先生大家都稱他為王三公子的慨然捐款一千元充救難經費，當時陳雲裳小姐為鼓勵王君的熱忱，願意和他伴舞一次，但是結果終被王君婉言謝却，接着來賓中便有以捐款點各明星歌唱的，一時捐款踴躍，而韓蘭根殷秀岑劉繼羣白劃章志直洪警鈴各位，都忙得不亦樂乎，演出了許多精采的節目，更有噱頭的，竟有一位來賓願捐法幣四十元，要求殷胖子韓瘦子兩位合跳一次舞，照例舞廳對於兩個男性跳舞是禁止的，但是為了救難捐款關係，居然破了例，最後由來賓把捐款加到一百四十元，兩位東方勞萊哈台終於下池起舞，引得全體來賓笑痛肚皮，眞所謂別開生面，計算成績點唱捐款達五百元左右，福果券約六七百元，門券收入六百餘元連同王三公子一千元總共約三千元。以小小的雲裳舞廳，能獲如許成績，也足夠我們滿意了　　又據筆者探悉，第二次慈善伴舞大會，將於一星期內在麗都舞廳舉行，將有更美滿的成績表演。香港「大地」第一砲　「孤島天堂」功德圓滿  代尼　　——白雲故鄕亦已開拍　　香港大地影藝公司的第一部出品是「孤島天堂」，本刋早已報導過了，現在已經全部完成，全片較普通映的片子長一倍，（普通約八九千呎至一萬呎），成本合港幣三萬餘元，以法幣時價計算，在十一二萬間，可以說「下巨大資本」攝製的一部戲了。該片導演是蔡楚生氏，蔡氏離開上海後，遺留下一部他已不承認是自己的作品的「王老五」，滬上觀衆都懷念着他的行踪。「孤島天堂」在攝製之初，預備打上海路綫的，所以內容以適合上海演出條件為主，且看本片中的幾個出塲人物，就可知道蔡楚生編製時的苦心孤詣了。里面有失掉了故鄕的舞女（黎莉莉），「神秘」靑年（李淸），洋塲闊少（洪虹），內地小姐（白璐），二房東（姜明），啞吧（李景波），傻子（藍馬）。　　香港公映日子約在本月中旬，據朋友來信，公映時將舉行一隆重的獻映典禮，不過什麽時候運到上海來，目前還沒有决定；一有决定，當隨時向讀者報吿。　　附帶報吿大地新片的消息，第二部司徒慧敏導演的「白雲故鄕」已經開拍了，費穆編導的「天外笙歌」亦開始動手，從這片名上看來，這些片子或許也都能運到上海來公映的，在一片「火燒」聲時，這多少是使我們高興的喜訊。　　附劇照一幀，讓關懷我們的藝人者先觀為快。　　黎莉莉　李淸　李景波在「孤島天堂」中陳歌辛發起　組織管弦樂隊  天馬　　今日起新都電台獻奏　　以作曲著名的靑年音樂家陳歌辛，過去在文壇上也是個頗露頭角的散文作家，而現在，除了自設學校敎授音樂歌唱以外，是難得為報章雜誌寫文章了。　　是突來的消息，說陳歌辛為新都飯店奔忙選擇留滬的外籍樂師和精擅歌舞的女郞組織一班大樂隊，將於九月一日起在新都玻璃電台及夜花園公開演奏。　　記者特訪陳君，據稱此事籌備即將完妥，此次管弦樂隊的組織，計劃已久，為提高滬地音樂缺覺水準，作新型歌舞藝術的　揚，他正抱着無限的希冀。　　陳歌辛的文藝修養相當不壞，他通意俄法英四國文字，自從獻身音樂畢業以後，聲譽鵲起，中法戲劇學校，明星演藝訓練所都請他担任敎授，其「嬰粟花」歌踊一劇震驚藝壇，創中國新型歌踊的坦途，各著名影片公司也爭聘作曲，於是，上海人的印象中，陳歌辛的音樂是深深的印在腦海之中了梨園外紀  徐慕雲　　新建戲館有開門破台諸迷信　　所以他一到此間就不甚樂意，他因為他徒弟單德元是唱武生的，兼以民十前後各地正在盛行着眞刀眞槍的短打武生戲，類如「三本鐵公鷄」「塔子溝」等，末後一塲當配下手的武行仆翻臺上時，主角往往以鋒利無比的短刃（形如匕首）拋擲伏者耳際，手法準確者儼如　年「金錢豹」劇中之擲鎘文，刀入毫板寸許，距離耳邊只毫髪之差，况伏者在下塲臺口，拋者在上塲門外，稍一大意，輒擲落池座中，對於看客危險殊鉅。因此之故，孟遂要求園主，由彼虔誠焚香作破臺之盛大典禮，希求祖師爺呵護，驅除邪崇，則彼師徒始得安心演奏。園主性極吝嗇，私忖該臺並非新建，茲雖中途停演頗久，但亦不必復作二次破臺之舉，以免　費金錢。不過孟氏為人耿直，園主早有所聞，今彼話旣出口，當然無法拒絕，惟只於暗中節省金錢，使孟無從偵知，因將此事敷衍過去。　　照破臺的慣例，須由全體武行人等扮作牛鬼蛇神種種妖異之狀，手持把子箱中各式武器，跳躍狂呼於舞臺之上，紅燈高燒，爆竹燃放，衆人列隊遊行，凡前後臺淮座兩廊，以及樓上等處，莫不繞行數匝，惟當諸人持械之前，例必先以鳥鷄黑狗血硃砂等物，醮滴於種種武器之上，然後再用以亂斫臺上之桌椅道具臺板牆壁各處，血與硃砂可以驅邪，故所斫之處，皆無邪崇矣。（九一）</p>

<h3>A New Turning Point in Europe's "War of Nerves": Direct Negotiations Between Germany and Poland Possible; Britain Resubmits Reply to Germany and Informs Poland; The Vatican Presented Peace Proposals to Five Nations Yesterday</h3>
<p>(London) After the British government sent a recent reply to the German government, no response has been received. Yesterday, the British government sent a copy of Hitler's message and the British reply to Polish Foreign Minister Beck, and no reply has been received from the Polish government. It is said that the Polish reply may arrive in a day or two, and it is expected that the German government will also continue to respond. According to Berlin sources, it has not yet been decided whether Germany will make a written reply to Britain's message. Informed sources believe that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has already explained to British Ambassador Henderson Germany's reaction to Britain's recent message. Diplomatic contacts are continuing, but German political circles believe that the situation has become more serious in the past 24 hours. The German people are gradually showing signs of unease, asking each other when the "war of nerves" will end. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British government's reply to the German note of the 29th arrived here by special plane at 11:10 last night. British Ambassador to Germany Sir Henderson personally handed it to Foreign Minister Ribbentrop near midnight and held talks, which ended at 12:14 am. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) According to Reuters, Britain's reply to Hitler's recent message was telegraphed to Berlin this afternoon. It is said that the content still leaves the door open for continued negotiations. The British Cabinet met this morning to study the draft reply. After receiving Hitler's message, the British side handed it over to experts for review and drafting a reply. This review work continued until 4 am this morning. Before the meeting began, it was reviewed for several more hours. While Foreign Secretary Halifax and Undersecretary Butler Jebb were drafting the reply, Prime Minister Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace again to see the King and informed France and Poland of the developments at any time. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The content of the note sent by German leader Hitler to the British government yesterday has not yet been announced. Newspapers here are commenting on it one after another. A telegram from the Morning Post's correspondent in London stated that Hitler had stated in the note that he hoped to establish a lasting agreement with Britain, which is the agreement on which European peace depends. Germany's demands on Poland must be met. "He is willing to draw up an agenda and list these requirements one by one, and then consult directly with Poland, but on the condition that the Polish government sends a delegation to Berlin to negotiate. The British government is said to have informed Poland of Hitler's proposal, and stated that whether to accept it or not is up to Poland to decide, and will not impose any pressure. In other words, the British government only expressed its hope to take various measures to ease the current tension between Germany and Poland, and that's all." The Paris Echo reported that "Last night, the British government sent a reply to Berlin, the content of which only explains the possibility of a peaceful resolution of the current dispute and direct negotiations between Germany and Poland. Because Britain has a mutual assistance agreement with Poland, it is inconvenient to discuss the solutions to various disputes between Germany and Poland in detail, so as to avoid suspicion of bias. Therefore, whether any plan is acceptable or not is up to Poland. The main goal of British diplomacy is only to create a good environment, so that a peaceful solution can replace the threat."</p>
<p>Warsaw According to the Warsaw Rapid Report, German leader Hitler suggested to the Polish government that it send plenipotentiaries to Berlin for negotiations. Political figures have explained that although Hitler made this proposal when talking with British Ambassador Henderson yesterday, it was not mentioned in the note to Britain. In short, the Polish government has never been unwilling to negotiate with Germany, but it must be based on a principle. This basis has been explained by Foreign Minister Beck and Army Chief Inspector Smigly-Rydz in successive speeches, that is, the merger of Danzig with Germany cannot be accepted, the cession of Pomerania to Germany cannot be discussed, and the negotiations should be conducted in a peaceful environment and based on mutual principles. In addition, some parties believe that Germany and Poland can choose one of the following two ways to conduct negotiations: one is through normal diplomatic channels, and the other is to send representatives to talk in a neutral country. Regarding the second method, a British newspaper suggested yesterday that it could be held in Stockholm, Sweden, but Poland refused to make any statement. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Vatican Regarding the current crisis in the European situation, Pope Pius XII is making peace efforts to the countries concerned. Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Maglione went to the Pope's palace this morning to ask for instructions from the Pope, and then arrived here. He successively met with the ambassadors of France, Italy, Germany, and Poland, and the British envoy, and presented notes to them separately. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<h3>Italian King Replies to US President, Willing to Mediate Peace; Belgium and the Netherlands Convene a Five-Nation Conference; Most Countries Express Support in Their Replies</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt telegraphed King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy on the 24th of this month, asking him to mediate peace. He has now received a reply from the Italian King, stating that the telegram has been received and forwarded to the government for verification and handling. Your Excellency's concern for the European situation is greatly appreciated. Italy will do its utmost to establish a just peace. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) People here are optimistic about the situation because Hitler and Chamberlain are still exchanging messages, but since the news of Poland's general mobilization order came, this optimism has largely disappeared. Everyone is afraid that Hitler will no longer tolerate this continued provocation. Now the Italian newspapers are still praising Mussolini's peace work. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>(Rome) People here believe that in the past 24 hours, apart from Poland's issuance of a general mobilization order yesterday, there have been no major changes. Public opinion generally believes that if the exchange of opinions between Britain and Germany on resolving the European situation is not interrupted for a day, the question of war and peace cannot be answered with certainty for a day. Famous Italian journalist Gayda recently published an article in the Italian newspaper, stating that the fate of Europe will have to wait a few more days before it can be decided. Now British Prime Minister Chamberlain and German leader Hitler are still continuing to exchange opinions and discuss solutions. At the same time, Prime Minister Mussolini and German leader Hitler are also constantly maintaining contact, thinking of completing this solution after the exchange of opinions between Britain and Germany.

<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano met with the Dutch envoy to Italy, Hubert, this afternoon. According to official statements, this meeting has no political significance. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>News from the Netherlands: Germany has accepted the joint mediation proposed by Belgium and the Netherlands. (Haitong, 31st)</p>
<p>Brussels, Belgium The Belgian government issued a statement to the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, expressing its willingness to mediate the European crisis. German Ambassador to Belgium Schwander visited Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pierlot in the afternoon, stating that the German government was deeply grateful. However, it did not specify whether it was accepting or rejecting. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers here today reported that the mediation of the Netherlands and Belgium has created a good impression in the German Foreign Ministry. The newspapers acknowledged for the first time that Germany is willing to negotiate a solution to the German-Polish issue, and stated that the exchange of opinions between Britain and Germany also proves that Germany is willing to negotiate with Poland. (Haitong, 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to French semi-official sources, France welcomes the mediation of the Netherlands and Belgium, and believes that a five-power conference is more likely than before. It is believed that the current difficulty is that Germany insists that Poland must first accept Germany's demands before a five-power conference can be held, while Britain and France advocate that Europe must first implement the demobilization of troops before participating in the conference. (Haitong, 31st)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Developments</h3>

This morning, Vatican officials felt that the hope for peace could be achieved, and the ongoing negotiations between Britain and Germany are expected to yield concrete results. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British authorities drafted a reply to the note sent by German leader Hitler to the British government yesterday and notified the French government this morning to seek their consent. Prime Minister Daladier immediately held talks with Foreign Minister Bonnet and exchanged opinions with the British government several times. The wording of the reply was carefully agreed upon. Responsible persons stated that the current situation remains serious, which can be seen from the concentration of German troops in Slovakia and the continued military defense measures taken by the Polish government to deal with new threats. However, since the British and German governments are still maintaining contact, there may still be something that can be done. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) From morning to night today, No. 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, received Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Cadogan, and met with them for about an hour in the morning.

(Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin Italian Ambassador Attolico went to the British Embassy at 8:00 this morning to talk with Ambassador Henderson, and then visited again at 10:30, meeting with him for about half an hour.

<p>(Berlin) According to reliable sources last night, Hitler may leave Berlin today, destination unknown. The Nazi Party said that Hitler will make a nationwide broadcast address within 48 hours. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Another German Plane Flies to London</h3>
<p>(London) A German plane flew from Berlin to Heston Aerodrome near London this morning, and then flew away at 7:00 this afternoon. The authorities refused to disclose who the passengers were. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Declares No Obstacles Between Germany and the Soviet Union; The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Discusses the Ratification of the German-Soviet Pact</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is scheduled to begin discussing the ratification of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty at 7:30 this afternoon. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to official announcements, Germany and the Soviet Union are currently discussing the German-Polish dispute. The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the Foreign Correspondence, issued a statement because of rumors that obstacles had occurred between Berlin and Moscow, stating that if the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty is studied closely, it can be seen that the treaty has been in effect since the day it was signed. The content of the treaty shows that the Soviet Union and Germany are eager to place mutual relations on a lasting foundation and to resolve outstanding issues between the two countries. At the same time, Germany is also notifying the Soviet government of the recent developments and diplomatic situation of the German-Polish issue at any time in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. The newspaper also stated that the Soviet official news agency's statement that the Soviet Union has strengthened its troop deployment on the western border is worthy of attention. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union is not paying no attention to the Polish issue. We must not forget the situation in 1919. The Polish issue is not only related to Germany, but also to the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>Hitler Faces Difficulties, Almost Unable to Eat or Sleep</h3>
<p>(Berlin) During this European crisis, Prime Minister Hitler has had less sleep in a week than anyone else. Since German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returned to Berlin from Moscow last Thursday, Prime Minister Hitler has been meeting with confidants until late at night every night. He often convenes official meetings until 2 am the next morning. After the meeting, he continues to meet with General Goering and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in his private residence, and cannot go to bed until 4 or 5 am. He gets up at 7 am every morning, drinks a glass of milk, a few biscuits, and some fruit, and then hurriedly goes to work. He often has a second breakfast at 10 am, but sometimes he forgets or delays it for several hours due to busy official duties. As for lunch and dinner, he eats them in his official residence, each time with fruits and other things. In this most tense situation after the European occupation, he does not show signs of nervous breakdown, and his facial expression and attitude are still very calm, but extremely serious. He speaks very little. For recuperation, he walks twice in the garden of his official residence every day, each time for about half an hour. During the walk, he often discusses the situation with Goering and Ribbentrop. He communicates with German diplomatic representatives abroad four or five times a day by telephone. Those close to Hitler claim that in his conversations this week, Hitler has repeatedly expressed that he can still find a peaceful solution in this crisis. (Associated Press, 31st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's New Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet has resigned en masse, and Abe has been ordered to form a successor cabinet. When the news first spread, and the new cabinet had not yet been formed, we expressed our sincere expectations and urged Abe to pay attention to three things, which are what we hope Abe will strive for. Three days have passed since then, and his cabinet members have been selected. Abe has taken office and, in the military garb of Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, has published a policy outline, which was published in yesterday's newspaper. The cabinet is the center of national action, and Japan is a source of turmoil in the Far East, so the change of the Japanese cabinet cannot be taken lightly. Now that the outline of the Abe Cabinet is faintly discernible, it seems that we cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>Based on what we have seen and heard about the Abe Cabinet in the past three days, it is clear that it has congenital deficiencies and acquired imbalances. Its inability to achieve anything and its lack of future prospects can be said to be destined from the moment it was born. According to the German Haitong News Agency, the military will have significant decision-making power in the selection of new cabinet members and the drafting of new plans. It also stated that the military demanded more action and fewer meetings. It also stated that Itagaki still possesses the greatest potential, and former Foreign Ministers Ugaki and Hirota, former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Yoshida, and former Ambassador to France Sato were all excluded. From this alone, it can be seen that the Abe Cabinet is still a "branch office" of the military. Its essence has no political authority or power. It can be said to have no soul, no value, and no essence. As for the policy characteristics that any cabinet of any country must have, it is not enough to speak of them in the Abe Cabinet. Those who defend Abe say that Abe, tracing back to Hiranuma, Konoe, and even Hirota, is actually in the same lineage. Abe's policy is at least still the policy of the Konoe era. Japan's Domei News Agency's publicity is the most superficial, stating that the new cabinet cannot change the fundamental policy for handling established incidents in any way. Even though the previous Konoe Cabinet resigned at that time, the successors never wavered, so the subsequent cabinets will never change any established policy of fundamental national policy. In fact, if the so-called policy and direction remain unchanged, why has the cabinet changed three or four times? This is not acceptable in political principle. Taking a step back, even if it remains unchanged, that is, if the policies and directions remain the same, then the so-called cabinet formation and the so-called new cabinet are too meaningless and too pitiful. If it is said that there is another meaning and it is not too pitiful, then the so-called policies and directions must be able to stand firmly, and the successors can follow in their footsteps and promote them. But what does Japan look like today? We will not list the ironclad evidence that is readily available to prove that Japan's policies and directions have not been able to stand firmly, but we can understand it from Hiranuma's statement of resignation when he stepped down. There are several sentences in his statement: "I have spared no effort to repeatedly appeal to His Majesty for the path of diplomacy and national construction, and to call for world peace and culture." It also stated that "In view of Japan's established preparation policy, under the changes in this situation, it is necessary to formulate a proper policy to deal with it." It also stated that "The consolidation of the domestic system and the change of the diplomatic axis are necessary for breaking through the extraordinary situation, transforming the situation, and renewing people's hearts." Therefore, not only must the policies and directions set by the Hiranuma Cabinet be changed, but they also need to be formulated separately. Even what has been set and done beyond the cabinet, and has been presented to the Emperor, which Japanese subjects have not dared to lightly discuss and change in the past, also needs to be formulated separately due to the change in the situation. Hiranuma resigned because "I am afraid that I will fail to live up to the Holy Grace; I am unable to bear this heavy responsibility." So, what are the policies and directions that Abe wants to inherit and remain unchanged? It is important to know that the Hirota statement, the Konoe declaration, etc., which are related to Japan's policies and directions, and in short, what the successive cabinets of Japan said and did before Hiranuma stepped down, have all become past relics in fact due to the passage of time, and have even been written off politically and legally by Hiranuma's statement of resignation. This great change should be a historical record and a landmark stage in the Far East issue.</p>
<p>Because of this, the person who succeeds Hiranuma as prime minister should have great plans and a grand strategy to create a new life for Japan's policies and directions. However, those who defend him and promote him have not been able to say a word beyond the idea of being in the same lineage and remaining unchanged. Furthermore, if we examine the policy outline published by Abe, it cannot be compared with the opening remarks of any politician in the world taking the stage, and even compared with what the successive new cabinets of Japan have proclaimed, it is no exaggeration to say that it is unprecedentedly weak and empty. The Japanese people are not unaware of this. It is no wonder that the newspapers in that country have no praise for the new cabinet. So, what will Japan under the leadership of the Abe Cabinet perform and do? The answer is: in hesitation, in exploration, in pursuit. Abe's so-called "For countries that understand Japan's position and are willing to cooperate, they should be treated as friendly countries and cooperate together. For countries that do not, they should be dealt with with a firm determination" exposes his hesitation and ignorance of what to get, and his exploration and pursuit. Yesterday's Domei News Agency's Tokyo telegram still stated that "After the cancellation of the Hiranuma Cabinet's policy towards Europe, a new concept should be used to quickly establish the Empire's diplomatic needle, but an isolationist policy will not be adopted." This is also a statement of pursuit without any goals.</p>
<h3>Germany Establishes Cabinet Defense Council, Appointing Minister of Aviation Goering as Chairman to Unify Military, Administrative, and Economic Management</h3>
<p>Berlin: Fuehrer Hitler issued an order today deciding to establish a Cabinet Defense Council effective immediately, chaired by Minister of Aviation General Goering. The order stated that at this time of extraordinary international political tension, to unify the management of national military, administrative, and economic affairs, a Cabinet Defense Council should be established within the National Defense Council organization, with General Goering as Chairman, and Party Representative Hess, Minister of the Interior Frick, Minister of Economic Affairs Funk, Chief of the Political Office of the Prime Minister's Office Lammers, and General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, as standing committee members. The committee may issue orders in lieu of laws, which have the same force as those issued by the Fuehrer, to meet the needs of national defense. According to responsible sources here, the organization of the Cabinet Defense Council is different from that of the National Defense Council; the former is composed of cabinet members, while the latter brings together talents from all walks of life. The intention of Fuehrer Hitler in establishing the Cabinet Defense Council is to concentrate the military, economic, and administrative power of the country to ensure effective cooperation, so that it can cope adequately in the event of an incident. (Havas telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin: Last night, the official announcement was made of the establishment of a special National Defense Cabinet meeting. Fuehrer Hitler signed and issued a decree stating, "During this period of international tension, in order to unify administration and economy, the following provisions are stipulated: (1) A German National Defense Council meeting is established as a standing committee of the National Defense Council, appointing Minister of Aviation General Goering as Chairman, and Party Representative Hess, Minister of the Interior Frick, Minister of Economic Affairs Funk, Chief of the Office of the Prime Minister's Office Lammers, and General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, as members, with the Chairman responsible for convening meetings. (2) The National Defense Council meeting may formulate laws with legal effect. (3) The authority granted to General Goering on October 18, 1936, to implement the Four-Year Plan remains unchanged. (4) The affairs of the National Defense Cabinet meeting shall be handled by the Chief of the Office of the Prime Minister's Office, acting on the Chairman's orders. (5) The effective date of this decree shall be determined personally by Me (Hitler himself)." (Haitong telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The Food Bureau recently issued an order stating that the menus of all restaurants must exclude meat on Mondays and Fridays, i.e., at least two days a week. On the remaining days, in addition to vegetables, four kinds of meat dishes may be used. (Havas telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The establishment of the Cabinet Defense Council by Fuehrer Hitler has recently been commented on by responsible sources, all of whom said that if war does break out, Fuehrer Hitler will probably personally serve as the Supreme Commander of the Army. This is because the Cabinet Defense Council, under the leadership of Minister of Aviation General Goering, assisted by Fuehrer Party Representative Hess, Minister of Economic Affairs Funk, and Chief of the Political Office of the Prime Minister's Office Lammers, can issue orders in lieu of laws, so the Fuehrer can concentrate on handling military affairs. However, senior army generals are quite anxious about this matter. A certain military magazine also said that it seems inappropriate for a head of state to also serve as commander-in-chief, which is the general opinion of all military experts. In addition, the organization of the Cabinet Defense Council is also quite noteworthy. Besides Minister of Economic Affairs Funk, who is a confidant of the dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, General Goering, the other two, Hess and Lammers, are both confidants of Fuehrer Hitler, which is enough to offset the power of General Goering. According to political figures, Fuehrer Hitler has been studying military affairs for a long time and has read many specialized works, and he is very interested in war plans. He often summons generals to explain technical questions whenever he has doubts. (Havas telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin: Fuehrer Hitler had originally planned to receive the newly appointed ambassadors of Argentina and Brazil today and accept their letters of credence, but due to the current situation, it has been postponed. (Havas telegram, 31st)</p>
<h3>Armed Conflict Occurs at Polish-Danzig Border; Polish Representatives Arrested in Danzig; Forster Meets Hitler</h3>
<p>700,000 German Troops Concentrated in Slovakia</p>
<p>Warsaw: An armed conflict occurred near the town of Orłowo on the border between Poland and the Free City of Danzig at around 1:00 AM this morning. Both sides fired several shots, but fortunately, there were no casualties. (Havas telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Warsaw: According to the Polish Telegraph Agency, two Polish representatives were arrested by the German secret police in Danzig after meeting with representatives of the Danzig Senate to discuss the supply of Polish food to the Free City and the reopening of passenger traffic between Czechoslovakia and Danzig. This meeting was suggested by the Danzig Senate and was held in a friendly atmosphere, but the Polish representatives were arrested after leaving the meeting place. (Reuters telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The semi-official agency, the Pat news agency, recently released a message stating that the head of its Berlin branch, Dunbicki, was arrested by the German political police on the 27th of this month and was not released until the next day. The Polish government has now allowed Dunbicki to leave German territory. (Havas telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Bratislava, Slovakia: German troops entering Slovakia are now continuing to move north in formation. The number of German troops stationed in the trenches bordering Slovakia and Poland has reached 400,000. The total number of German troops that have entered Slovakia to date has reached 700,000. It is reported that Slovak troops have also been sent to the front lines. (Associated Press telegram, 31st)</p>

<h3>French Government Requisitions Railways; Schoolchildren Evacuated from Paris</h3>
<p>Paris: France is still gradually making war preparations. Military experts are very satisfied with the smooth implementation of a partial mobilization. An order will be issued today to place all railways under military control, stating that all companies must prepare to make all transport equipment deemed necessary for military transport by the Army Department available to the government. Commercial transport will be suspended in whole or in part depending on military needs, pending further orders. These measures will be applied equally to passengers and goods. The government may requisition all railways at any time before the order is issued if deemed necessary. Eight thousand schoolchildren, each carrying two days' rations, a blanket, and a small box, were transported yesterday to "children's colonies" set up in Volins and various towns southwest of Paris. To reduce the pain of separation, relatives were allowed to accompany the children to their new homes. The authorities have not yet released figures on the number of people who have taken up arms, but although great efforts have been made in military preparations, daily life across the country has remained largely unchanged. Although the number of buses and trams on the streets has been greatly reduced, they are still filled with pedestrians. Censorship of news has begun, so there are often blank spaces in newspapers. The Standing Committee has appealed to Boy Scouts, students, etc., to assist farmers in harvesting the remaining crops in the fields. Germany has now issued ration coupons, but there is certainly no shortage of food in France. (Reuters telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Paris: The government has recently issued an order deciding to requisition all railways nationwide from tomorrow, stating: (1) All railway companies shall immediately make all railway vehicles and personnel available for government use to facilitate military transport. (2) All railways shall suspend all or part of ordinary passenger and freight transport as needed by the military. Passenger and freight trains may be intercepted by the government midway before reaching their destination, and passengers may be ordered to disembark or the goods unloaded in order to free up vehicles for military use. The railway companies shall not be liable for any losses suffered by passengers and freight merchants as a result. In addition, the Ministry of Public Works issued a statement saying that ordinary passenger and freight transport on the railways is not completely suspended, but that military transport shall have priority. (Havas telegram, 31st)</p>
<h3>British King and Brother Inspect Navy; London Evacuates Population</h3>

<p>London: The War Office recently announced that the number of regular army soldiers enlisted in the last five months totaled 22,436, an increase of 6,372 compared to the same period last year. (Havas telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>London: The London Stock Exchange announced today that the government has now ordered London residents to begin evacuating from tomorrow, so the Stock Exchange will be temporarily closed tomorrow. The date of reopening will be notified by radio broadcast. (Reuters telegram, 31st)</p>
<h3>Poland Maintains Normalcy After Implementing Mobilization Law; Reserve Soldiers Called Up for Training</h3>
<p>Warsaw: After the government implemented the mobilization law at noon today, there have been no drastic changes here. All traffic is as normal, with only a few scenes proving that the situation is indeed extraordinary: (1) Middle-aged women and young men are carrying shovels and axes to dig air-raid shelters. (2) The Standing Committee broadcasted this evening, ordering people to turn off their lights as soon as they receive an air-raid warning. (3) The streets are dimly lit tonight, and all vehicles are driving very slowly. As for the newspapers here, they all have brief descriptions of the mobilization measures, stating, "The government has taken new military measures today, all of which are to step up defensive preparations, and the scope is not as broad as the measures taken in the past. The people of the whole country have a long-standing love of their country and are deeply aware of the seriousness of the current situation, and they will certainly wholeheartedly support it." In addition, the newspapers here will apply tomorrow for women, children, and the elderly to leave, except for those who must stay in the capital. As for the border between Germany and Poland, several disputes broke out again today. In one place, it is reported that an armed conflict occurred. (Havas telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Great attention is being paid here to the news from German sources that Poland has issued a general mobilization order. Political circles claim that this move has created an "extremely serious situation." A political spokesman told a Reuters reporter, "This is the most bizarre response to the Hantsen forces and another proof that Poland relies on its guarantees. Poland's actions are most detrimental to Britain." German newspapers claim that railway traffic between Berlin and East Prussia has been blocked by the Polish authorities. The morning express train from Malbork to Berlin, which is guaranteed by the 1931 German-Polish state railway agreement, is reported to have been blocked by the Polish authorities. Here, Poland's actions are referred to as "violating national agreements" and denounced as "another proof of impossible and intolerable circumstances on the German border." A Berlin correspondent for a Hamburg newspaper said that it is possible for Britain and Germany to discuss the final common political goals, but the responsibility for the incidents on the Polish-German border rests largely with Britain. As far as Germany is concerned, "the solution to this matter will no longer be discussed but must be implemented." (Reuters telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Warsaw: This afternoon, the radio station here issued a warning in Polish and English to all ships sailing in the Baltic Sea, saying that it is very dangerous to sail along the Polish coast, and that they should not enter the port of Gdynia without a pilot. Since German ships stopped sailing, only ships from Poland, Denmark, and Sweden are now sailing along the Polish coast. (Havas telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Posters have been found all over the city, calling up all trained reserve soldiers under the age of 40 to enlist and report today. This measure is not a general mobilization, but only a response to Germany's military occupation of Slovakia. The authorities have ordered the requisition of horses, cars, and bicycles, but only from private individuals who will receive a notice. The sale of alcohol has been strictly prohibited. It is reported that Poland's adoption of the above measures does not contain any provocative intentions, but is only taking precautions due to Germany's recent repeated actions. The walls of Warsaw are covered with leaflets with portraits of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, Ri Zi-Miglish, and photos of tanks, airplanes, artillery, and troops. According to a communique issued by the government, Germany began to carry out news propaganda several months ago, implementing a policy of aggression against Poland. German leaders have repeatedly made threatening remarks, carried out systematic provocations, and continuously concentrated troops on the border with Poland. Then Germany interfered with Danzig and made territorial demands. Poland's sense of threat is undoubtedly clear. Poland has always expressed its support for the mediation efforts of various countries, but the German government has not yet responded. In view of the above facts, it is undeniable that the entry of German troops into Slovakia has forced Poland to take defensive military measures to protect its security. The communique ended by saying that Poland's policy has never harbored any ambition to invade any other country and remains unchanged to this day. (Reuters telegram, 31st)</p>
<h3>Five Nordic Countries Negotiate Neutrality Issues</h3>
<p>Norwegian Capital: Danish Foreign Minister Dr. Munch is currently here meeting with the foreign ministers of the four Scandinavian countries to discuss the adoption of neutrality policies by each country. Munch reportedly told reporters yesterday, "Everything in Denmark is extremely calm, and I firmly believe that war can be avoided. General public opinion in Denmark believes that the current situation is clearer than the political atmosphere in September of last year." Finnish Foreign Minister Airko also holds an optimistic attitude towards the current situation. His remarks were roughly as follows: "Finland has not taken any exceptional actions regarding mobilization laws and trade restrictions, which is sufficient to show Finland's will to strictly adhere to its neutrality policy."

The withdrawal of Japanese troops from the Hong Kong border has been confirmed, indicating other intentions. According to reports, the Japanese are planning to completely block the land and sea border of Kowloon, while at the same time attempting to attack the Chinese troops on the outskirts of Huizhou. Currently, there are a total of 1,000 to 2,000 Japanese troops on the Chinese-British border. Japanese troops are stationed along the road from Daya Bay to Nantou, and tanks and heavy artillery are advancing towards the Dongjiang River. (31st special telegram)</p>
<p>Beiping: A military spokesperson said today that the Eighth Route Army led by Zhu De is still operating in the southeastern area of Shanxi Province. The spokesperson said that the reason why the Eighth Route Army has not been surrounded by the Japanese is that it can take advantage of the heavy rain in the area. He also said that the Japanese army's attack on southeastern Jin should have been a great success, but because the Eighth Route Army adopted a mobile strategy, the Japanese army's goal was difficult to achieve and they are still being forced to fight fiercely. It is claimed that there are no fewer than 130,000 Chinese Communist troops fighting the Japanese army in southeastern Jin this time, with 12,000 killed in action and 1,000 captured alive. It is reported that Zhu De has 150,000 troops in southeastern Jin. (Associated Press telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: The Chinese army surrounding Zengcheng fought with the Japanese troops at Caocun South, north of the city, at 6:00 AM on the 31st. The Japanese troops were unable to hold out and fled to the north gate to resist stubbornly. The Chinese army immediately recaptured Caocun, a stronghold on the outskirts of Zengcheng, and burned and destroyed the Japanese barracks. Subsequently, the Japanese army reinforced and counterattacked. The two sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. At the same time, a unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops outside the west gate, destroying several Japanese transport vehicles and killing 20 Japanese troops. (31st telegram)</p>
<p>Huiyang: More than 500 Japanese troops who invaded and occupied Kwai Chung were fiercely counterattacked by the Chinese army on the afternoon of the 29th. The Japanese troops resisted stubbornly, and the fighting was fierce. After repeated charges by the Chinese, they entered the Japanese阵, and launched a bayonet charge, killing many Japanese troops. By the evening, the Japanese troops were unable to hold out and fled towards Yongguan, and Kwai Chung was recaptured. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: More than 300 Japanese troops invaded the vicinity of Dajingtou on the morning of the 29th. The Chinese army responded calmly. The Japanese troops launched repeated attacks, but all failed. By noon, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese troops' exhaustion and launched a full-scale attack, engaging in a bayonet charge, killing more than 100 Japanese troops. The Japanese troops were unable to hold out and fled in panic. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Chinese army × unit drove out the Japanese troops in Guluo (east of Hongdong) on the 24th and completely destroyed the highway between Hongdong and Guluo. The only transport supply line for the Japanese army to cut across southeastern Jin is now completely in the hands of the Chinese. (30th telegram)</p>
<h3>Chinese Government Has No Intention of Accepting Mediation; Japan's Policy Toward China Has Not Fundamentally Changed; China's Attitude Is Firm and Will Not Negotiate with Japan</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding foreign rumors that the British government will come forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese War, officials here have maintained silence. It is widely believed that judging from the international situation, the British government may act as a mediator between China and Japan. However, Chinese sources here have stated that China has absolutely no intention of accepting mediation. The fact that Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday proves that regardless of whether Britain or other countries act as mediators, China is determined not to negotiate with Japan. The reason why China has adopted this firm stance is that it firmly believes that Japan's policy toward China has not fundamentally changed. Regardless of the fact that the international situation is already different and the Hiranuma Cabinet has been reorganized, its consistent policy toward China will not undergo any changes. Therefore, the "Ta Kung Pao" pointed out that we should not attach too much importance to the fall of the Hiranuma Cabinet, because the new cabinet may adopt a more moderate attitude toward Britain, but toward China, it will remain the same.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Releases Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that the Japanese troops on all fronts have become increasingly exhausted in recent days. The Japanese troops, having suffered repeated defeats on both the northern and southern battlefields, and becoming increasingly isolated in the international situation, have suffered a major blow to their ambition to gamble everything. Although they exaggerate propaganda in an attempt to cover up, in fact, they are increasingly in a helpless situation regarding their military aggression against China. The following is a summary of the course of operations in the past week (August 23 to August 29):</p>
<p>Shanxi Province: The Chinese army in southeastern Jin has been winning victories in recent days. Since recapturing Jincheng last week, more than 4,000 Japanese troops have fled to Gaoping along Qiling Village, Wangtai, and Bagong Town. After taking advantage of the victory to pursue, Gaoping was recaptured on the 23rd, and the pursuit continued. The remaining Japanese troops mostly fled to Changzhi. Currently, there are about 10,000 Japanese troops near Changzhi. Because they cannot withstand the pressure of the Chinese army, they are fleeing north in different directions. The Chinese army's attacking troops have reached the line of Bayi Town and Xinzhuang, and one unit has occupied Han Village Town, surrounding the Japanese troops in the county seat from several directions, which can be captured soon. In addition, there are more than 2,000 Japanese troops in the Changzi area, who are stubbornly resisting. After fierce attacks, the Japanese troops have shown signs of wavering. The Japanese troops on Jiwang Mountain and Tongwei in southern Jin have gathered more than 4,000 troops, and have launched fierce attacks for days. After being severely attacked in different ways, the Japanese troops' momentum was thwarted. The remaining troops have now fled to Wenxi, Xiaxian, Anyi, and Yuncheng. Since Lan County in northern Jin was captured by the Japanese army last week, the Chinese army rushed to counterattack after reinforcements arrived. After several days of fierce fighting, in addition to the recapture of Lan County, the vanguard has approached Jingle and is attacking the city fiercely. More than 2,000 Japanese troops have suffered more than half their casualties, and are fleeing north in droves, showing signs of abandoning the city walls. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing Without Success; Forced by Chinese Fighters, Unable to Select Bombing Targets</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to the Air Defense Department here today, 27 Japanese planes attacked Chongqing this morning. Because Chinese fighters took off to meet them in advance, they had no time to select targets and mostly dropped bombs on empty land in the suburbs. No bomb explosions were heard in the city. It is claimed that the Chinese fighters forced the Japanese planes to above thick clouds, causing them to lose their targets. Therefore, the bombs they dropped caused almost no damage. (Associated Press telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: An alarm was issued here at 11:20 last night. It is reported that 36 Japanese planes flew to Chongqing from Yichang, but only nine dropped a few bombs in the suburbs, and the rest did not arrive. The alarm was lifted at 3:15 this morning. According to the investigation results, there was no damage. (Haitong telegram, 31st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The alarm sounded loudly at 11:30 last night, because nine Japanese bombers were seen flying towards Chongqing, followed by several other Japanese planes. Two hours later, the Japanese planes approached Chongqing City, and the Chinese fighters immediately engaged them. The Japanese planes were flying very high and, after engaging the Chinese planes in the clouds, fled westward, dropping bombs in the mountains about 15 miles from Chongqing. They then returned to the vicinity of Chongqing City and repeatedly tried to enter the city, but the searchlights did not allow them to hide, and the Chinese fighters were close behind them. The Japanese planes had to flee. The alarm was lifted at 3:00 AM. There is an orphanage in the mountains on the outskirts of Chongqing that houses hundreds of orphans from the war zone. It is unclear whether they are safe, because the orphanage's telephone is currently out of service. However, it is reported that the bomb shelter that was recently built with donations has been gradually completed, and the orphans can probably use this shelter during night air raids. It is now known that a total of 54 Japanese planes participated in the moonlit air raid. According to this morning's communique, 20 to 30 Japanese planes, divided into three or four groups, dropped bombs in several places on the outskirts of Chongqing City. It is now known that the wreckage of a Japanese plane that was shot down on August 28 has been found. It is reported that the Air Defense Command received a telegram from the Jiangjin County Magistrate yesterday, stating that a Japanese bomber crashed there on the night of August 28 and requesting that representatives be sent to inspect it.

<h3>Laiyang County and Penglai County in Shandong Province Recaptured</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Shandong: The puppet troops in Jiaodong have repeatedly defected. Currently, more than 1,000 troops under Han Nongrong and Huang Aijun have defected one after another, killing more than 200 Japanese troops. In addition, Gao Yupiu, the puppet commander of Laiyang County, and Li Zongxuan, the puppet commander of Penglai County, also surrendered at the same time after being persuaded by the Chinese army. Both county towns have been recaptured. (31st telegram)</p>
<h3>Recent Month: Japanese Military Deaths Exceed 23,000</h3>
<p>—Review by Pravda— 154 Tanks Destroyed, 31 Vessels Sunk</p>
<p>Moscow. Pravda's review of the Sino-Japanese War states: "In the latter half of July and the first half of August, the scale of military operations on both sides was relatively small, but the losses suffered by the Japanese side were still extremely heavy, with more than 23,000 soldiers killed in action and even more wounded. During the same period, the Chinese side intercepted 962 rifles, 34 machine guns, and 10 artillery pieces, destroyed 154 Japanese tanks, armored vehicles, and transport vehicles, and sunk 31 Japanese warships and transport ships.</p>
<p>"The Japanese efforts to sweep up guerrillas in southern Hebei and Shandong provinces have failed. The Japanese army twice attempted to encircle the areas of guerrilla activity in the mountainous areas of Boshan County, and even used poison gas to attack the guerrillas. The Japanese army engaged in this sweeping operation totaled more than 50,000 men, but both attempts were unsuccessful, and after losing more than 5,000 men, they retreated to their own base.</p>
<p>"The course of operations during this period proves that the combat effectiveness of the Chinese army, supported by the entire population, has been further enhanced." (TASS dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>Allegation of Occupation of Yokohama Specie Bank Denied by British</h3>
<p>Tianjin. The rumor spread by the Japanese that the British Concession authorities had occupied the Yokohama Specie Bank building to accommodate flood refugees has been denied by British officials today. However, they stated that this method had indeed been considered in the past. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi Requests British Foreign Office Not to Extradite Suspects in Assassination of Cheng. Two Lawyers in London Issue Statement Saying British Handover is Inconceivable</h3>
<p>London. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi today sent a note to the British Foreign Office, requesting that the four suspects in the Tianjin assassination case be temporarily detained by the British authorities in Tianjin and not extradited to the Japanese side, pending further negotiations. The note expressed dissatisfaction with the British government's response to the case, stating that handing over Chinese prisoners to the Japanese side, who are the plaintiffs, is clearly an unfair action. It is hoped that the British government will not be prejudiced before further negotiations and hand over the four prisoners to the Japanese side. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Tianjin. According to sources here today, although the British side claims that if the Japanese side can provide adequate guarantees for the four suspects in the Cheng assassination case, the four can be handed over to the "Provisional Government," these guarantees have not yet been received today. Therefore, the four are still under British custody. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Tianjin. The British Consulate in Tianjin has sent a letter to the Chinese court, requesting it to issue a formal warrant to bring forward the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng assassination case. However, these four Chinese may not be extradited today. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>London. According to reports from Tianjin, the four suspects in the Cheng assassination case are scheduled to be handed over today by the British Concession in Tianjin to the pro-Japanese Tianjin Chinese court. It is understood that this matter is being handled in accordance with a special directive from the Central Government. The Japanese government had long requested the handover, but the British authorities refused the request due to insufficient evidence. Later, the Japanese military authorities submitted some evidence, so despite appeals and opposition from London, Shanghai, and Tianjin, the British government finally agreed to hand over the four suspects. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>London. Recently, two Chinese men wrote to Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote, claiming to be the "culprits" who assassinated the Tianjin Customs Superintendent. The letter explained that they were moved by patriotism and acted in this way because they did not want innocent people to suffer in their place. They stated that if the Governor of Hong Kong agreed not to extradite them to the Japanese side, they would be willing to surrender to the judicial authorities. The Chinese Embassy here has now received a photographic copy of the letter. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>American Sympathy for China's Resistance</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Liang Shichun, former head of the Department of Journalism at Yenching University, recently returned here from the United States. According to him, most people in the United States sympathize with China's resistance. Whether in private conversations or public gatherings, Americans' belief that China can achieve final victory is growing daily. According to Liang's observations, there are three reasons why Americans sympathize with China's resistance: (1) The national character of China and the United States is similar; (2) There is close cultural contact between the two countries due to the activities of American missionaries in China; (3) Americans have always been deeply opposed to acts of aggression. Liang believes that if China can do more skillful propaganda in the United States, it will definitely be able to obtain greater assistance from the United States.

<h3>American Public Opinion Supports European Democratic Countries. Roosevelt Consults with the Secretaries of the Navy and Army on the European Situation. A Special Meeting Will Be Convened If Necessary</h3>
<p>Washington. Political figures here predict that President Roosevelt will not issue another appeal to German Führer Hitler, but will take action domestically to prove to the world that the United States government and people sympathize with all democratic countries. The Congress will be convened for a special meeting, at which time the Congress will unanimously respond to the American public opinion's support for European democratic countries. President Roosevelt declared the day before yesterday that a special meeting of the Congress would be convened only when a European war was imminent, and that he would request Congress to grant him special powers to act freely to deal with the situation. In addition, the government authorities are well aware that the current Neutrality Act and the wartime arms embargo clause are not conducive to the democratic countries, and will naturally seek to abolish them quickly. Foreign observers say that American public opinion has reacted strongly to the future development of the international situation. If the Congress does hold a special meeting, it will definitely recognize that President Roosevelt and the State Department's attitude towards the Neutrality Act is not for the sake of winning the next election, but is indeed due to a full understanding of the international situation. According to American political figures, when the Congress convenes a special meeting to discuss the abolition of the arms embargo clause, the government may seek to revive the "cash and carry" clause and prohibit American cargo ships from sailing in war zones. As for the current situation, President Roosevelt is talking to ambassadors stationed abroad from time to time, and is reviewing the reports submitted by the ambassadors to understand the development of the situation. (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Washington. Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the press, saying, "I know the general outline of the note that German Führer Hitler sent to the British government yesterday, but this kind of important document, I announce, is a matter for the countries concerned. We can only keep it secret." (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Washington. According to reliable sources, if the current negotiations between Britain and Germany to mediate the Polish issue fail again, President Roosevelt is prepared to make another appeal for peace to Hitler. If Hitler still does not listen to advice and still attempts to achieve his goals through a policy of force or threats, President Roosevelt is prepared to close the entire German market to the United States. It is reported that the President yesterday held a 45-minute consultation with the Acting Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of the Army at the Military Resources Department for this matter. The President also spoke with the State Department by telephone yesterday to inquire about the latest news from ambassadors stationed in Europe. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement Ready for Signing</h3>
<p>London. Britain and Turkey have been negotiating a mutual assistance agreement to replace the current mutual assistance declaration for a long time. According to political figures, this negotiation, which is being conducted in the Turkish capital, has entered the final stage and can be signed in the coming days. This shows that although Turkey maintains close relations with the Soviet Union, it does not refuse to support the peace front because the Soviet Union and Germany have signed a non-aggression treaty. As for the Soviet Union's attitude, the British side is reluctant to make a hasty judgment, believing that the claim that the two countries are getting closer is unreliable, and the claim that the Soviet Union is secretly putting pressure on Germany to solve the Polish issue peacefully should not be taken lightly. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>London. Responsible parties here recently announced that Yugoslavia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria are currently exchanging views, intending to unite to resist Germany and to prevent any harm to the independence of each country. They agree that this should be done in the economic field. If German pressure intensifies, these countries may sign an agreement. It is reported that Italy has expressed its support for this plan, and Yugoslavia is also actively working to promote reconciliation between Romania and Hungary. Regarding this, Germany has requested the Yugoslav government to allow it to use Yugoslav railways to reach the Italian port of Trieste from Vienna, Austria, via Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, but this has been rejected by Yugoslavia. This fact has important significance. In addition, responsible parties in Hungary also said that the country has made it clear to the German government that if Germany sends troops into Hungary, thereby infringing on Hungary's independence, Hungary may assist Poland in the war. (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(Capital of Yugoslavia) The German semi-official agency Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur recently issued a message stating that when a war breaks out in Europe, Yugoslavia will maintain friendly neutrality towards the Axis powers. When this statement was posed to the responsible personnel, they replied that this message was not issued by the government, but was only a personal opinion. (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(Capital of Romania) Today, negotiations with Hungary on signing a non-aggression treaty continue. Officials refused to comment on this matter. (Associated Press dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>British Air Defense Department Regulates Food Supply</h3>
<p>London. The National Air Raid Precautions Department recently issued a bulletin today, stating, "In order to regulate the food supply, this department hereby appeals to the people of the country not to buy more food than usual. In other words, the amount purchased should be limited to normal needs. Those who have already stockpiled food should continue to store it and not use it for the time being in case of emergency. The reason for this is not that food is already in short supply, but to prevent people from suddenly buying too much food and seeking more than the supply can provide."

<h3>Dutch Reservists Entering Service Reach 300,000</h3>
<p>(Capital of Belgium, Brussels) The Belgian News Agency recently received a message from The Hague, Netherlands, stating that after the Dutch government implemented mobilization yesterday, fifteen classes of reservists, a total of three hundred thousand men, have been conscripted into the army within nine hours.

<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Receives Polish Reply Expressing Gratitude for His Call for Peace</h3>
<p>(Ottawa) Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King sent a telegram to the heads of state of Germany and Poland, calling for peace. German Consul General Wendel visited Prime Minister Mackenzie King today and verbally replied that the German head of state, Hitler, had received the telegram and had nothing else to say. At the same time, Polish Consul General Bolika also sent Prime Minister Mackenzie King a reply from Polish President Moscicki today, expressing his gratitude and stating that Poland deeply understands the Canadian Federation's desire for a peaceful resolution of the current dispute. (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(Ottawa, Canada) A portion of public opinion has recently requested the government to publicly declare that the Canadian Federation will fight alongside Britain in wartime. Prime Minister Mackenzie King replied with a speech, stating, "The position of the Canadian Federation is well understood by all countries in the world. There is no need to declare it again. In short, we are currently maintaining close contact with London." (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>

<h3>New British Ambassador to the United States Presents Credentials and Talks at Length with Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Washington. The new British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, presented his credentials to President Roosevelt at 3:00 PM. The ceremony was simple. Afterwards, they talked at length in the President's study for an hour and a half, which was unprecedented. When presenting his credentials, Lord Lothian first expressed his gratitude on behalf of British King George VI and Queen Elizabeth for the previous welcome from the American government and people. Then he said, "I am deeply pleased to come to the United States to take office at this time, when the world is filled with war clouds and countries are preparing for war. This is truly an international misfortune. My government is willing to do its utmost to preserve peace and, based on justice and reason, adjust various international political and economic disputes, thereby assisting all countries to restore prosperity and establish peace. My government also deeply believes that in promoting this peace policy, it shares the same goals as Your Great President and Your People." President Roosevelt then replied, "The main task of international diplomacy is to find peaceful and constructive solutions to disputes between countries and to prevent war. Unfortunately, the madness of war seems to have spread throughout the world. As for the United States, my government and people have been working to build lasting peace for many years. We hope to eliminate the fear of aggression that countries are suffering from. In this effort, we are pleased to see that Your Country's government and people also share the same feelings."

<h3>New Japanese Cabinet Reviews Diplomatic Policy. American Ambassador to Japan Scheduled to Return to Post. Japanese Military Delegation Arrives in Italy</h3>
<p>Tokyo. After transferring affairs from former Prime Minister Hiranuma at 11:30 a.m. today, new Prime Minister Abe convened senior cabinet officials and gave a speech, stating that the policies decided by the cabinet must be implemented quickly in order to achieve the stated goals. Establishing a diplomatic policy that can cope with the new world situation is the most important task entrusted to the new Abe cabinet. The government will convene cabinet meetings every day in the near future to review diplomatic policy. After the policy is established, a full-time foreign minister will be appointed to specifically implement this policy. In his first statement upon taking office on the 30th, Prime Minister Abe stated that the government's fundamental position and guiding spirit for establishing this diplomatic policy is to build a new order in East Asia. In order to realize this national policy, Japan will adhere to its own position and, with a spirit of independence, seek to adjust the international environment. However, it will not adopt a policy of international isolation. All countries that understand Japan's position and are willing to cooperate with Japan will be regarded as friendly countries and will work together to seek coordination. If they do not truly understand Japan's position, Japan will strictly adhere to honorable isolation and take decisive measures against countries that attempt to obstruct Japan's mission.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Abe's decision to concurrently serve as Foreign Minister has important significance and is not a tentative measure that will be cancelled after an appropriate full-time Foreign Minister is found. Therefore, this point is extremely noteworthy. After the Hiranuma cabinet's policy towards Europe was cancelled, a new concept should be used to quickly establish a diplomatic policy. This is an important task for the new Abe cabinet. Regarding this point, it was also clearly stated in the first statement on the 30th when the cabinet was formed. Prime Minister Abe, who is concurrently serving as Foreign Minister, naturally has the determination to personally take on the heavy responsibility. The Prime Minister's policy is that a full-time Foreign Minister will not be appointed until the government's diplomatic policy is established. A full-time Foreign Minister will only be appointed after the diplomatic policy is established. (Domei dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Washington. American Ambassador to Japan Grew has been on vacation in his hometown in New England for a long time. He recently came here to prepare for questioning by the State Department authorities because the Japanese Hiranuma cabinet resigned. Now that this matter is over, he has returned to Cory for vacation. It is reported that he plans to return to his post in Tokyo on the 14th of next month. (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Rome. The Japanese military and financial investigation team, led by former Army Minister Terauchi Juichi and Admiral Osumi Mineo, arrived at the port of Naples last night. The team has a total of eleven members, including well-known economic experts Isaka and Fujiwara. Regarding this matter, Roman political figures are associating it with the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet. Foreign public opinion has the same view, believing that the reason why Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a treaty is because they are expressing a lack of interest in the Axis powers. However, political figures here publicly stated that Britain wants to use the opportunity of the German-Soviet treaty to make Japan break away from the Axis powers. Italy will never fall for this trick. "Carillo Report" stated that the German-Soviet treaty only has the meaning of opposing European financial oligarchic politics and does not have the meaning of being anti-Japanese.

<p>(Capital of Switzerland) The National Council today voted unanimously to pass a bill to grant the government full powers to implement plans to protect the country and maintain Swiss neutrality. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>(Capital of Switzerland) After Switzerland's partial mobilization, foreign observers here recently stated that Switzerland has united in the European crisis. The people who were called up for military service were very enthusiastic. According to the Federal Constitution, Swiss citizens are allowed to keep firearms and ammunition at home. Once the government issues a mobilization order, they only need to take their military uniforms and weapons from the wall and go to the designated barracks to serve. This method is extremely quick, and the people of the country can immediately practice sacred unity. All the arguments in the newspapers are very stable, but the people freely express their opinions, and many are dissatisfied with National Socialist Germany. Political figures even stated that the firm attitude of Britain and France is a good guarantee for Switzerland's democratic country. European countries have been under the threat of force and the crisis of war for more than a day. It must be lifted. As for the economy, the Swiss government has recently spent 200 million francs to strengthen national defense. If there is a general mobilization in the future, the sacrifice will definitely be greater. It can be seen how important the European situation is to the Swiss economy. For example, after foreign tourists have left one after another, most hotels are deserted. This is also one of the impacts on the Swiss economy. (Havas dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Service Law to be Changed. Voroshilov Proposes New Bill</h3>
<p>Moscow. People's Commissar of Defense General Voroshilov recently submitted a bill to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, proposing to extend the term of compulsory military service for infantry, air force, and border guard officers by one year (the original term of service for infantry was two years). In addition, the age of enlistment for young people will also be changed from 19 to 18. University students who were originally granted special exemptions from military service will also be cancelled. (Havas dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<h3>Food Sent to Spear Has Not Yet Been Received</h3>
<p>Beijing. Regarding the treatment of British military attaché to China, Colonel Spear, who is still being detained by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou, the spokesman of the Japanese army in Shanghai refuted Reuters' inaccurate news at a reception for reporters on August 28. However, this area recently received a letter from Colonel Spear dated August 25, stating that the food sent by the British Embassy in Beijing to Zhangjiakou on July 5 had not been received by him until the letter was sent. From this, it can be seen that the statement of the spokesman of the Japanese army in Shanghai that the items sent to Colonel Spear have been handed over does not conform to the facts. As far as this area knows, the British Embassy has received a railway receipt proving that the items it sent have safely arrived in Zhangjiakou and have been handed over to the Japanese army that detained Colonel Spear. The British Embassy has negotiated with the Japanese Embassy on this matter several times. Captain Parke, a British military officer who recently visited Colonel Spear in Zhangjiakou, was dissatisfied with the food supplied by the Japanese side when he was in Zhangjiakou. After Captain Parke returned to Beijing, he confirmed that the food sent to Colonel Spear on July 5 had not been delivered. The British Embassy then continued to negotiate with the Japanese Embassy. The Japanese Embassy promised to investigate this matter, but the Japanese authorities in this area did not say that the food had been delivered, as the spokesman of the Japanese army in Shanghai said.

<h3>Nehru's Broadcast to Japan</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Indian National Congress leader Nehru specially broadcast to Japan today, praising China's heroic resistance, and deeply regretting the destruction inflicted on China by the Japanese side. He then offered advice to Japan, saying that he had always greatly respected Japan, but now seeing its cruel and unparalleled war of aggression against China, which is the source of Japanese culture, he cannot but feel sorry for Japan. "We have no malice towards Japan; what we detest and abhor is the policy Japan is pursuing towards China." Finally, he expressed his supreme admiration for China's spirit of fighting fearlessly against difficulties and hardships, believing that it is the only guarantee of China's final victory. (United Press, 31st)</p>
<p>Chongqing. It was learned today that the President of the All-India Congress, Nehru, has received a telegram from the All-India Congress urging him to return to India, so he has decided to fly from Rong to Yu tomorrow. If possible, he will fly to Kunming this Saturday or Sunday to return to India. However, Mr. Nehru stated that if the European situation eases, he would like to stay in China for some time. Therefore, it will not be possible to decide on his departure until he arrives here from Rong tomorrow. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>Japan's Naval Problems</h3>
<p>The Japanese army, before the Sino-Japanese War, was viewed with awe and regarded as an invincible and unstoppable elite force. However, after testing it, it was realized that it was nothing special. Although the Japanese navy had a moment of glory in the Russo-Japanese War, the current situation is very different from that time. It has never competed with modern naval powers, and it is unknown whether it is just as falsely renowned as the army. However, British Prime Minister Chamberlain is very afraid of it causing trouble, so in his talks with Tokyo, he claimed that "there is no way in the Far East except to submit to Japan." Is this a sincere statement or a pretext for implementing his appeasement policy? No one can make a definitive judgment. The following article was written by Mr. Owen, a lawyer from the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia. He usually studies defense issues and has written many books. Reading it can reveal how capable the Japanese navy is. It was originally published in the combined issue of the Australian Institute of International Affairs in June and July and reprinted by the Millard's Review. Now it is translated and offered to readers who are concerned about current affairs. ... Editor</p>
<p>In the Pacific naval problem, critics with insufficient experience and many military personnel often ignore the seriousness of the difficulties Japan encountered in wartime in this region. At present, it is possible to review Japan's war within a limited scope, and the war that does not hinder her maritime trade or her territory. From a purely military point of view, the Japanese army is coping with a difficult war in China, and it is generally considered effective. If these Japanese troops were fighting against one or several first-class powers, the situation would be completely different. What is described in this article is this aspect of Japanese affairs.</p>
<p>Australians have a slight tendency to accept the pessimistic views of critics who lack experience and have not studied this issue in many ways. This view carries a serious risk of affecting defense policy in times of crisis.</p>
<p>Japan produces a considerable amount of food for its people, but important raw materials such as coal, oil, rubber, and iron must be imported. To maintain the stability of the internal economy, it is necessary to strive for continuous export trade in peacetime and wartime. Many of the difficulties that Britain encountered during the last war are now encountered by Japan, and these difficulties will be even greater in any major war in the Pacific region in which Japan may participate. Obviously, Japan must maintain its maritime trade with the Asian continent in wartime, and from Japan's point of view, it is eager to maintain its trade with the East Indies, Southeast Asia, and North and South America. Japanese commentator Ishimaru mentioned in 1935 that the sea routes distributed by Japanese trade were as follows...</p>
<p>(1) To the Asian continent, north of Hong Kong... 19 percent</p>
<p>(2) To the Asian continent, south of Hong Kong (including Hong Kong) 18 percent</p>
<p>(3) To the East Indies, the Philippines, and Oceania... 11.5 percent</p>
<p>(4) To North and South America... 33 percent</p>
<p>(5) Other regions (via Singapore)... 18.5 percent</p>
<p>Totaling 100 percent</p>
<p>Ishimaru also said that in the event of war with Britain, 48 percent of this trade would be cut off, but trade across the Pacific to the United States or to northern Asia was not included in this 48 percent.</p>
<p>During the World War, once Britain had dealt with the relatively few enemy raiders overseas, it was able to confine enemy ships in narrow seas, preventing them from sailing out. The position of Japan is the opposite. Its trade may be attacked thousands of miles from its base. At present, no one can imagine that Japan can eliminate or blockade every possible base of enemy ships attacking its commerce, especially when recalling the newer cruisers with the long range that was almost unimaginable during the World War. The British cruiser of the Arethusa class has a range of nearly 12,000 miles.</p>
<p>Furthermore, today's vulnerable sea routes are immeasurably longer than those that were vulnerable during the World War. Here are some distances:</p>
<p>(1) Japan to Korea... 120 miles</p>
<p>(2) Japan to Shanghai... 470 miles</p>
<p>(3) Japan to San Francisco 4,760 miles</p>
<p>(4) Japan to Mexico 6,950 miles</p>
<p>If Japan were to fight against an enemy country with enormous raiding power, then these sea routes would be attacked at any time and could only be dealt with by a large-scale resistance plan. The patrol system makes a relatively large part of Japan's naval power unavailable for mobilization, and the convoy system is very expensive and obstructive, and may not be possible, because Japan lacks convoy ships suitable for long-distance travel. (A large number of cruisers are required.) When these needs are taken into account, one can realize the enormous difficulties Japan will encounter when trying to carry out large-scale offensives thousands of miles away from Japan, while also maintaining its trade routes that are vital to its survival. When an expeditionary force leaves its base, it requires more naval escort ships not only to launch operations but also to maintain supplies and reinforcements for every hundred miles added. According to naval authorities, the merchant shipping required for two fully equipped divisions amounts to more than 300,000 tons.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan's problems are (1) maintaining its maritime trade to the extent that its domestic and war industries receive the necessary supplies, (2) supporting the expeditionary forces it wishes to send far overseas, and (3) maintaining its export trade in order to maintain the stability of its domestic economy. These objectives require a large navy, but not necessarily a concentrated force in the form of a battle fleet. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Dinghai: Japanese Army Induces Various Traitors; Guerrilla Forces Active in All Directions</p>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence. Since the fall of Dinghai, the Japanese army has forced local gentry to organize a puppet Maintenance Association, which was later changed to a puppet Autonomous Committee, and has now been transformed into a puppet Provisional County Government. At present, puppet courts, puppet tobacco and alcohol tax collection offices, puppet land tax collection offices, etc., have all appeared. It is reported that the president of the puppet court is Wang Luquan. The head of the puppet tobacco and alcohol tax collection office is Hu Hexing. The head of the land tax collection office is Guo Dengke. Among the youths who serve in puppet positions are Shu Minliang, who serves as a staff member of the puppet education section, and Zheng Fengyi, who serves as a clerk in the secretariat of the puppet county government. As for the salaries of the puppets, it is reported that the president and vice-president of the puppet Autonomous Committee receive 200 yuan per month, and the heads of each puppet section receive 100 yuan per month. Puppet staff members receive a monthly salary of 50 yuan, and puppet clerks receive about 30 to 40 yuan. Therefore, shameless people who are extremely poor and tempted by profit are asking people to seek a puppet position. This is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The Japanese army currently stationed in Dingcheng has about 100 soldiers, who are from the troops of Maoxiong Laidao. Previously, they were stationed in the residence of Zhu Jiansan in the East Gate, the People's Club, the residence of Pan Shangmo outside the South Gate, and other places. It is now reported that the Japanese troops stationed in Zhu Jiansan's large Western-style house have moved to the original site of the cooperative behind the park a few days ago. Recently, Chinese guerrilla forces have been active in the suburbs, and the Japanese army has specially increased the number of defense soldiers at each city entrance. At 8:00 p.m., a curfew is imposed. After the fall of Dinghai, County Magistrate Su of Dinghai crossed the sea to other places to reorganize his subordinate departments, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. The security of various villages on Dinghai Island is maintained by the guerrilla forces led by Ding Yi, the chief of staff of the county command. Recently, it was reported that County Magistrate Su and Captain Zhang, etc., have secretly landed in a certain village in Dinghai, and have distributed their troops in all directions to launch guerrilla warfare. Many civilians and youths have volunteered to participate, most of whom are young teachers. They have also established schools in various villages, so that rural children can receive anti-Japanese education and not be enslaved by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Hits Qingpu; Houses Destroyed; Rice and Cotton Damaged</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence. The day before yesterday, a hurricane passed through Qingpu, coupled with torrential rain, so that the remaining houses were blown down. In addition, except for the early rice that has been harvested, the hurricane had little effect. However, the late rice that was growing but not yet mature was mostly broken by the storm. The cotton in the eastern part of the county was also affected by the wind and rain, and the autumn harvest is feared to suffer extremely great losses.</p>
<h3>American Student Arrested at Peking Union Medical College</h3>
<p>Peking Correspondence. On the evening of the 21st of this month, an American student from Peking Union Medical College was walking to the Ping'an Cinema when he was suddenly arrested by plainclothes Japanese. He is currently being detained at the pseudo-police station in the first district. Afterwards, personnel from the American Embassy contacted him for release, but there has been no result. The truth about the detention is still under investigation.</p>

<h3>Forced Use of Puppet Currency for Tax Collection; Bank of China Firmly Refuses; Will Withdraw Tax Collection Personnel if Necessary; Puppet "Supervisor" Actually Sets Implementation Today</h3>
<p>In fact, it is an increase in tariffs; Chinese and foreigners alike attach great importance</p>
<p>Chongqing. The authorities here were very surprised to hear that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs issued a notice that customs duties should be paid in "Huaxing Bank" banknotes. The British diplomatic delegation has also not received any information about this matter. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is now asking the British diplomatic delegation to inquire with the British Ambassador about everything. It is reported that there is a saying in the Shanghai Customs notice that "by government instruction." The Chinese government is very puzzled by this, because the Chinese government has never issued such instructions. The Chinese authorities now attach great importance to this matter and urgently hope for the British Ambassador's reply. After the unfortunate fall of Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs was forced to change the way it collected taxes, which were intercepted and deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. Now "Supervisor Li of Jianghai Customs" is ordered to force the use of "Huaxing Coupons" as the conversion standard for tax collection starting from September 1st. Tax Commissioner Lawford stopped issuing an implementation announcement last night. The Tax Collection Office of the Central Bank has firmly refused and will withdraw tax collection personnel if necessary. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tax Collection Entrusted to the Central Bank All tax collection of the Jianghai Customs has always been entrusted to the Central Bank, and a commission contract has been signed. The Central Bank sends personnel to establish a tax collection office of the Central Bank at the Jianghai Customs. The funds collected are paid to the Customs Service according to the contract. Import and export taxes and other taxes are all denominated in customs gold. The Central Bank announces the price of legal tender converted into customs gold every day. For example, yesterday it was 2.556 legal tender yuan converted into one customs gold yuan. This calculation is based on the London pure gold market price conversion. Since the unfortunate fall of Shanghai, the Central Bank has still handled tax collection matters in accordance with the contract, and the taxes collected are paid to the Customs Service as usual.</p>
<p>Forced Acceptance of Huaxing Puppet Coupons The so-called "Reformed Government," in order to promote the "Huaxing Coupons," ordered "Supervisor Li Jiannan of the Jianghai Customs" to attempt to force the Jianghai Customs to accept "Huaxing Coupons" starting from September 1st. The method is that all import and export taxes and other taxes of the Jianghai Customs will be based on the "Huaxing Coupons." All import taxes and surcharges collected in customs gold will also be converted into "Huaxing Coupons." Those paid in legal tender should be converted according to the conversion rate announced by the "Jianghai Customs Supervision Office" every day. Li Jiannan has notified Tax Commissioner Lawford, forcing him to implement it starting from September 1st.</p>
<p>Japanese Tax Commissioner Accepts Implementation Koichi Oyamada, the extra Japanese Tax Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, has accepted the notice from Supervisor Li Jiannan and plans to implement it starting from September 1st. It is reported that the method is that in the past, one customs gold yuan was equal to a certain amount of legal tender, and now one customs gold yuan is equal to a certain amount of "Huaxing Coupons." If legal tender is paid, it must be calculated in advance according to the published conversion price of the "Jianghai Customs Supervision Office." Customs gold is still calculated based on London pure gold, "Huaxing Coupons" are converted at an exchange rate of six pence to the British pound, and legal tender is converted according to the black market exchange rate. In fact, it deliberately suppresses the value of legal tender, and increases tax revenue in a disguised form.</p>
<p>Central Bank Decides to Refuse The tax collection office of the Central Bank at the Jianghai Customs is located at No. 3 Ma Road, the Bund, inside the Jianghai Customs, and has branch offices stationed at the General Post Office and at the Jianghai Customs Wharf. The tax collection office inside the Jianghai Customs specializes in collecting import and export goods and surtaxes, etc. The post office branch specializes in collecting parcel taxes, and the wharf branch specializes in collecting baggage taxes. Since being entrusted by the Jianghai Customs to collect taxes, it has been eleven years. There is one director of the tax collection office, and there are more than one hundred staff members in total. It is reported that they have decided to refuse to accept "Huaxing Coupons," but as of 5:00 p.m. last night, they have not received any notice from Tax Commissioner Lawford.</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs Under Heavy Guard Since yesterday morning, the Jianghai Customs has been under heavy guard. There are detectives from the concession authorities stationed around the Bund and the four corners of the Three Horse Road. The tax collection office of the Central Bank has water police from the Customs, many of whom are Japanese. A reporter from the New Voice News learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank is unwilling to express any opinion before receiving the notice from Tax Commissioner Lawford of the Jianghai Customs, but will telegraph the situation that has been circulating to the Chongqing headquarters for instructions, but will definitely refuse to accept "Huaxing Coupons" no matter what. If forced to accept them, they will have to withdraw the tax collection personnel.</p>
<p>Lawford, the Tax Commissioner, Sets a Compromise New Voice News reporter visited a senior Chinese official of the Jianghai Customs several times yesterday. According to him, the acceptance of "Huaxing Coupons" will be implemented starting from September 1st, and the Jianghai Customs will issue a notice to inform everyone at that time, etc. However, as of 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the official notice of the Tax Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs had not been seen, so whether it will be implemented today is still in doubt. It is also reported that Lawford, the British Tax Commissioner, is considering a compromise so that the tax collection of the Central Bank will not have any problems, because these tax collection personnel are all experts and ordinary personnel cannot bear this heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Merchants Attach Great Importance To the use of Huaxing Coupons, Chinese and foreign banks, shops, companies and firms in the Public Concession and the French Concession have unanimously refused to accept them, so Chinese and foreign merchants attach great importance to the Jianghai Customs' acceptance of "Huaxing Coupons." They believe that if the Jianghai Customs implements it, it will directly promote "Huaxing Coupons" and indirectly increase tax revenue in a disguised form, but they do not attach importance to the announcement of "Supervisor Li of Jianghai Customs," they only attach importance to the announcement of the Tax Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, because no official announcement of the Tax Commissioner has been seen as of now, so there has been no statement, but they believe that this method affects the interests of British and American merchants, etc.</p>
<p>Foreign Trade Is Very Unhappy The English-language North China Daily News said that Li Jiannan, the "Supervisor of the Jianghai Customs" appointed by the "Reformed Government" of Nanjing, issued a new announcement No. 4 this morning (31st), which will increase the import and export taxes of this port by about 15% starting tomorrow (1st). Foreign trade in Shanghai is very unhappy and quite shocked by this. Starting tomorrow, customs duties will no longer be accepted in customs gold coupons, and all customs duties and other income must be paid in "Hongkou Coins" or legal tender, but based on the false British exchange rate of six pence, which means that Huaxing Coins will be accepted at a price of six pence, while legal tender will only be accepted at the current open market price of four pence, so the customs conversion rate is 100 Huaxing Coins equal to 150 legal tender yuan. The gold unit is now only retained as a method of calculation, but it is no longer an intermediary for paying taxes. After the Customs issued this announcement, it not only accepted "Hongkou Coins" for paying customs duties, but also</p>
<p>The value of legal tender gold units has also been reduced by about one-third. Starting tomorrow, import and export merchants will pay 15% more in customs duties than they paid this month. This measure is equivalent to increasing customs duties by 15% and giving foreign trade in Shanghai another heavy blow. Import trade has already suffered heavy losses due to the depreciation of legal tender, and many businesses have been</p>
<p>Completely stagnant, the impact of the 15% increase in customs duties is even greater. The "Reformed Government" of Nanjing is clearly trying to increase revenue and has set this plan. In addition, it also plans to make "Hongkou Coins" the intermediary for payment in Shanghai. It is also recalled that the Japanese authorities in this port, the spokesman at the press conference hosted by the Japanese side, and the managers of the Huaxing Bank have repeatedly stated that they want to make Huaxing Coins enter the ranks of Shanghai customs currency. According to the North China Herald, paying customs duties with Huaxing Bank notes has now become a reality. According to the official announcement, starting tomorrow (1st), customs duties will not be accepted in customs gold coupons, but must be paid in Huaxing Coins or standard coins." The "standard coins" referred to here are the banknotes issued by Chongqing, whose market price is two pence lower than that of Huaxing Coins, so</p>
<p>Merchants will pay more in customs duties than before. Li Jiannan, the Customs Supervisor who issued the order (appointed by the Reformed Government), told reporters that he treated Huaxing Coins and standard coins equally, but wanted to collect customs duties based on a basis of six pence per yuan, "to compensate the Customs for the losses suffered due to the depreciation of legal tender." Therefore, Li's order stated that the tax rate will not be affected, and the tax rate will be adjusted only when the price of Huaxing Coins falls</p>
<p>Below six pence to cope with the difference between six pence and the market price of Huaxing Coins. Li also explained that, in other words, even if Huaxing Coins fall below six pence (current value), taxes will still be collected on a fixed basis of six pence per yuan. One customs gold unit is worth 2.396 yuan (officially set price</p>
<p>Equals four cents in U.S. dollars). If Huaxing Coins fall below six pence, then the holder of the coupons will pay "about three yuan." The conversion rate between customs gold units and Huaxing Coins and standard coins, and the conversion rate between Huaxing Coins and standard coins, will be announced in the Customs. The full text of the order is as follows: For the purpose of announcing matters, in compliance with the instructions of the "Government," starting from September 1, 1939, customs duties will not be accepted in customs gold coupons, but must be paid in Huaxing Coins or standard coins.</p>
<p>When the price of Huaxing Coupons falls to a minimum of less than six pence, the customs gold unit will remain unchanged. In other words, the tax rate will not be affected. The tax rate will only be adjusted when the price of Huaxing Coins falls below six pence to cope with the difference between six pence and the market price of Huaxing Coins. The conversion rate between customs gold units and Huaxing Coins and standard coins, and the conversion rate between Huaxing Coins and standard coins, will be announced by the Customs daily.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds; Interest Paid Starting Yesterday; Issue Receipts First and Then Pay; Rebuilding Principal and Interest Allowed for Discounting</h3>
<p>Rebuilding Principal and Interest Allowed for Discounting In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance has issued the second payment of interest on National Salvation Bonds, which has been issued from the national treasury revenue and delivered to the Central Bank to handle interest payment matters starting yesterday. The total amount of the bond issued is 500 million yuan with an annual interest rate of 4%, and the amount of interest payable this time is 20 million yuan for the second time. Although the Central Branch in Shanghai has received a telegram from the head office approving the timely payment of interest, whether it is a remittance or cash has not been clearly indicated in the reply telegram, so another telegram has been sent to the Chongqing head office for instructions. A reporter from the New Voice News learned from the Central Branch yesterday that as of last night, no reply telegram has been received, and the payment date has arrived. The bank has decided on a temporary method: all bondholders who take interest from the bank will first be issued a temporary receipt by the bank, and payment will be made after the reply telegram arrives in Shanghai. In addition, the seventh installment of principal and interest of the 25th year of the Republic of China Rebuilding Bonds, totaling 11,594,000 yuan, has been discounted and paid by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank since the National Debt Fund Management Committee negotiated the discounting and payment. However, Shanghai will pay it off in six installments, each installment for one month, and will pay it with a remittance note. However, bondholders must first fill out an application for discounting the principal and interest of the domestic debt guaranteed by customs duties, and then the bank will issue a temporary receipt, which will be exchanged for a "discount voucher" in the future. The first installment will be paid starting today, and the second to sixth installments will be paid on schedule.</p>
<h3>Japanese Install Defense Works in Hongkou and Other Places</h3>
<p>Military Telephones Installed in West Shanghai It is reported that starting yesterday morning, the Japanese army installed military telephones in the area west of Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai, outside the road construction area beyond the boundary to Caojiadu. It is also reported that along the way in the area of ​​Glen Road, Dinghai Road, and Jungong Road in Hongkou, the Japanese also installed defense works in the knee-deep water on the road yesterday. The reason is unknown.</p>
<h3>Store Delivery Envelopes Must Be Stamped</h3>
<p>#### Having the Nature of a Substitute Invoice</p>
<p>When stores sell goods and only provide envelopes, but list the number of items, stamps must be affixed. Also, for delivery envelopes, if it is noted that a certain amount is owed, stamps should also be affixed. The Zhejiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce presented the following interpretation from the Ministry of Finance: "Your telegram is acknowledged. Upon inspection of the submitted envelope, it contains the phrase 'goods of a certain number of pieces' and bears a stamp, which is no different from a delivery invoice. If it is issued by the seller and no separate invoice is issued, it has the nature of a substitute delivery invoice and stamps should still be affixed according to the first item in the tax rate table. Even if it is issued by the carrier, and it contains payable accounts, stamps should also be affixed according to the regulations for account statements. Please take note."</p>
<p>Continued News on the Issue of Jewish Refugees Landing</p>
<p>Regarding the landing issue, a mainland newspaper reports: Yesterday (the 30th), it was learned that even if war breaks out in Europe, the Shanghai authorities will allow German refugees who left Europe before August 19 to freely enter the Hongkou district controlled by the Japanese and the various areas of the Public Concession. Those who departed after this deadline will not be allowed to land in Shanghai and will be decided by the Special Refugee Committee. It is expected that the Japanese Consul in Shanghai will soon discuss this matter with the committee, and the meetings of the committee are kept extremely secret. Those in charge are rushing to draft a plan this week to care for the large number of refugees arriving in Shanghai. Around 619 people arrived this Sunday, and several hundred more are scheduled to arrive in the coming weeks on the Italian ship "Conte Verde." However, the fate of immigrants still at sea when the European war breaks out remains undecided. Large German and Italian ships carrying refugees will dock at neutral Dutch East Indies ports. Whether the refugees will remain in the East Indies or be transferred to Shanghai on neutral ships is still unknown. At the same time, there are deep fears that funds are insufficient to care for the increasing number of refugees arriving in Shanghai. The International Committee yesterday appealed to all parties to continue donating.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Handles Disaster Relief Work</p>
<p>Regarding disaster relief work, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road, due to the severe Anhui disaster, the board of directors resolved to allocate 20,000 yuan to first provide emergency relief to the most severely affected counties. It is now learned that the association has allocated the full amount of relief funds. The relief work is being carried out by the Anhui branch of the World Red Swastika Society in the vicinity. The association is also raising funds for relief efforts for the Tianjin flood.</p>

<p>The Unspeakable Secret of a Husband with Kidney Deficiency</p>
<p>Fate is often extremely cruel to men. After painstakingly searching for a woman, and using every possible method to engage in conversation, progressing from conversation to acquaintance, from acquaintance to interaction, from interaction to friendship, and then from friendship to further love and marriage, one truly doesn't know how much brainpower and effort must be spent to finally enjoy the sweet and happy life! However, in today's hurried world, the burden of life weighs heavily on the shoulders of the groom. When the nuptial comedy is underway, he often exhibits symptoms of kidney weakness and premature ejaculation, causing the joyful occasion to be a fleeting moment. Thus, seeking pleasure turns into displeasure, and joyful events become bitter experiences. This is a very common occurrence. However, this is not necessarily always a pathological condition. If the husband has always been chaste and physically strong, he will surely be unwilling to give up and will persevere. With determination, success will eventually be achieved. After repeated training, he will undoubtedly be able to achieve perfect harmony with his wife in love, like fish in water or ascending to immortality. Therefore, love is strengthened, sons and daughters are born, and a fulfilling family is built. How glorious and happy this is! However, if repeated attempts are futile, or if he is barely able to cope in the early days of marriage, but then gradually declines, and in the couple's sexual relationship, he completely exhibits impotence, then in the husband's heart, it is simply like a mute eating bitter melon, unable to express his suffering! At the same time, it is undoubtedly a pathological condition.</p>
<p>According to medical diagnosis, a man develops this pathological condition because of early self-pollution, seminal emission, or excessive indulgence in sexual activity after marriage, which wastes too much reproductive gland fluid. Thus, kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, neurasthenia, incomplete development, and premature aging occur. This type of man, not only faces the danger of being rejected by those unmarried, but also suffers from the inability to fulfill his desires in married life. At the same time, he is bound to be listless in his work and encounter failures. Studying will be hampered by brain decay and forgetfulness, and he will inevitably drop out halfway. He may even suffer from multiple illnesses and pains, leading to a short and tragic life, resulting in many heart-wrenching widows and orphans!</p>
<p>Kidney deficiency is no longer an incurable disease today. Since the development of the reproductive gland hormone "Sheng Zhi Su," there is now an even more effective treatment. Patients who actively take "Sheng Zhi Su" can generate essence and replenish the kidneys, nourish the nerves, invigorate the brain and blood within a day and night. Continued use can further promote development and regulate metabolism. All of the above symptoms can be completely cured in a short period. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can achieve the effects of longevity and rejuvenation. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Ximi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (available at Zhong Fa Wu Zhou and other major pharmacies) to control leakage and achieve rapid results!</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Gao Jingming, from Shandong, 28 years old, suffered severely from kidney deficiency and brain weakness, with occasional seminal emission. Working in the banking industry, he was almost unable to cope. He had also been married for five years without having children. Last month, he consulted me, and I instructed him to purchase and take "Sheng Zhi Su" and "Ximi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian." His seminal emission stopped after a week. In less than a month, his kidney deficiency and brain weakness were also cured. As a result, he had abundant energy, his relationship with his wife was loving, and his career was flourishing.</p>
<p>The Evil Consequences of Seminal Emission and Self-Pollution</p>
<p>Sexually Transmitted Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Dear young friends, I wish you a glorious and pure life, without the slightest blemish. You should know that a flaw in a perfect gem will leave endless regret! The period of youthful awakening is the most dangerous time. If you are weak-willed and unable to control your sexual impulses and the temptations of the external environment, and commit self-pollution and indulgence, you will not only lose your virginity, like a stain on a flawless gem, but also suffer damage to your sexual nerves, relaxation of the seminal gate, and the terrible symptom of seminal emission will follow.</p>
<p>Physiologically, semen is the reproductive gland fluid, the source of our life. A young person who is chaste and practices good hygiene and exercise will have abundant gland fluid, resulting in physical development, agile thinking, and abundant energy. Therefore, they can learn anything quickly and make steady progress in their studies and career, with unlimited prospects! At the same time, due to their handsome appearance, they will be successful in love, choosing a satisfactory wife. Since their married life will be fulfilling, the couple's love will be deep and they will have unlimited happiness! On the other hand, if a man suffers from seminal emission due to self-pollution and indulgence, and if the seminal emission is neglected and untreated, leading to depletion of semen, then symptoms such as brain decay, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin semen, infertility, and premature aging will follow one after another. At this time, he will inevitably be pale and emaciated, and his energy will be scattered. With the slightest mental effort, he will feel tinnitus, blurred vision, and unbearable pain. With the slightest physical exertion, he will feel tired and unable to support himself. In this state, how can he study as a student? How can he work in the business world and be successful? At the same time, his married life will be extremely painful, and even lead to various tragedies within the family.</p>
<p>This cannot but be attributed to confusion. If seminal emission is treated at its onset, by abstaining from self-pollution and taking the effective medicine "Ximi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian," the illness can be cured quickly. However, if seminal emission has already caused negative consequences, with the above-mentioned symptoms, then to cure the seminal emission, one must still actively take "Ximi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian," as this medicine has the miraculous effect of strengthening the seminal gate, calming the nerves, promoting sleep, and stopping emission. However, it is necessary to also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, essence and blood, and nerves. Continued use can further promote development and regulate metabolism, and all symptoms will be completely cured in a short period. Patients who can come to our clinic for electrotherapy and injections can be guaranteed a cure.</p>
<p>The Fate of a Woman is Controlled by Beautiful and Healthy Breasts</p>
<p>American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen the sexy star "Oomph" girl Ann Sheridan on the screen cannot help but feel a sense of longing, especially the younger male audience. The reason why Ann Sheridan is able to become a top Hollywood star today is not only due to her acting skills, but also to her physical beauty. She has a pair of high breasts, a flexible and slender waist, and full and rounded hips. Therefore, her curves are very obvious, and her walking posture is truly captivating. With such a beautiful young woman, coupled with a pair of charming eyes and a dreamy tone of voice, it is no wonder that she captivates all beings and becomes extremely popular.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether or not a woman's physique is beautiful and healthy can indeed influence her entire life's fate. Moreover, men's eyes are now so discerning when they look at women. If they see you are beautiful and graceful, they will spare no effort to be humble and careful in flattering you, even willingly bowing down under your shorts and cheongsam, becoming the only faithful follower in your love web, remaining unchanged forever. If they see your breasts are shriveled, your hips are thin, your beauty is lost, and there is no flesh to move people, then on the contrary, even if you frequently send flirtatious glances and are willing to devote yourself to service, you can forget about winning their favor. Therefore, women who have lost their beauty are bound to fail in the competition in social situations. Even if they marry, they are often abandoned by their husbands, leaving them with lifelong regret! To seek remedy, one can only rely on science. According to the results of repeated experiments by world-renowned gynecologist Cansnasr and American doctor William O. Puckott, as well as myself, it is unanimously recognized that taking the reproductive gland ovarian endocrine preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su," is the most suitable and effective treatment. The main reason for breast atrophy is that the ovarian function is affected by self-pollution, chest binding, persistent leukorrhea, menstrual irregularities, malnutrition, weakness after illness, and other symptoms, affecting the metabolic process. Therefore, if one takes the carefully prepared ovarian preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su," the effect will be immediate. Continued use will not only make shriveled breasts rise high, presenting a firm and elastic state, but also turn thin hips into plump ones. In addition, it can also redden the cheeks, enhance natural resistance, prevent all diseases, and enjoy youthful happiness for a long time.</p>

<p>Treating Gonorrhea that has Reached a Stalemate</p>
<p>When treating illnesses, it is ideal for the process to be smooth and for a complete cure to be achieved in a short period. This way, the patient's physical pain, mental distress, and financial losses can all be avoided. However, in many cases, because the patient and the doctor are careless in the initial stages of the illness, they fail to seize the opportunity for easy treatment, leading to a stalemate. This is particularly true in my experiences over the past decade with gonorrhea that has become a stalemate after being mistreated. In the initial stages of gonorrhea, it is not difficult to treat. It is simply that the patient's psychological fears and environmental constraints result in a stubborn, chronic leukorrhea, further dimming the chances of a cure. As a result, the patient gives up on themselves, engaging in a slow form of suicide, which is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>In fact, in my experience, while it is easier to cure gonorrhea in its initial stages, it is essential to find a truly qualified specialist to achieve results. Otherwise, neither new nor old leukorrhea can be cured by these ordinary doctors. However, if gonorrhea that has become a stalemate due to mistreatment by these ordinary doctors can be treated with the latest methods, prompt surgery, and the doctor's utmost care and effort, it can still be cured. I once cured a patient who had a fifteen-year history of gonorrhea. He had been in treatment every year, and had tried almost every treatment method. After my examination, I used a rational diagnostic method and determined that he had developed chronic arthritis. I then used chemical therapy and injected Xi's serum, while also using German "Filter Lymph" electrotherapy. By combining these treatments, he was completely cured in five weeks.</p>

<p>Lihe Shipping Company Shanghai-Ningbo Route Limits Passenger Numbers Original Iron Ladders Provide Convenience for Passengers</p>
<p>Absolutely No Self-Hired Small Boats Allowed to Board</p>
<p>The Ningbo and Shaoxing associations in Shanghai recently pointed out that Shanghai-Ningbo ships docking outside Zhenmei Port, when transferring passengers, are prone to accidents due to inadequate facilities. They sent letters to Lihe Shipping Company and China-Italy Company requesting improvements and the addition of iron ladders for passengers to board and disembark, prioritizing safety. After receiving the letters, the shipping department of Lihe Shipping Company sent the following reply: "In response to your letter stating, 'According to a letter from your committee members Shen Liang and Wang Dihui, because Shanghai-Ningbo ships now dock outside the port and use small boats for transfer, passengers and goods are hoisted by ropes, which is extremely dangerous. It is requested that all ships add iron ladders for passengers to board and disembark,' we have noted this with respect. Our Moufu ship already has iron ladders and wide hatches, and the facilities are suitable and safe for passengers to board and disembark. There has never been any hoisting by ropes. The situation described in your letter must refer to something else. We are sending this letter in reply for your information." According to the person in charge of the shipping company's business office, who spoke to a reporter from Da Guang She, the company has recently strictly limited the number of passengers. Passengers must first purchase tickets from the company before being transported to the ship by special shuttle boats. Passengers are absolutely not allowed to hire their own small boats to avoid accidents caused by rushing to board.</p>
<p>International Exposition Product Fair Temporarily Concludes</p>
<p>Complying with Orders to Cease Participation</p>
<p>Returning Submitted Products</p>
<p>The China International Exposition Product Association was established in Shanghai in 1933, jointly organized by representatives of product manufacturers from various provinces and leaders from all walks of life, and was duly registered. At that time, the main task was to participate in the Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, USA, which proceeded very enthusiastically. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the directors of the association, considering the evolution of the situation and environmental factors, found it necessary to strengthen the organization by moving it from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Therefore, on April 16th of this year, a general membership meeting was convened at the Dahua Hotel in Hong Kong to reorganize. Wang Xiaolai was re-elected as chairman, Mi Xingru as secretary-general, and Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Li Zushen, Zhang Zhuping, Ye Lanquan, Zhang Zilian, etc. as executive directors. A Hong Kong office was established at Room A710, 8th Floor, China Building. At a meeting of the executive directors, the American Golden Gate Exposition had already closed and had already been participated in by overseas Chinese and Shanghai businessmen, so it was deemed unnecessary to discuss it. The preparations were underway and had been approved by the Executive Yuan at its 415th meeting on May 23rd, with a subsidy of 100,000 national currency for participation. Later, because Ambassador Hu in the United States advised the Ministry to cancel the previous order due to the approaching end of the exposition and the urgency of the situation, the association convened a meeting of the executive directors on June 16th and resolved to comply with the government's wishes and report to the Yuan and Ministry to cease participation. It is reported that the association, in addition to handling the return of previously collected products from various parties and dismissing staff, temporarily concluded operations at the end of last month. Its correspondence address remains at the original location.</p>

Also, in accordance with a letter from the International Postal Union, "Effective August 10th of this year, all used clothing, etc. mailed to the Republic of Argentina must be accompanied by a disinfection certificate from the competent authority of the country of origin, and endorsed by the Argentine consul in the place of origin, or they will be prohibited from mailing." This is notified for your information.</p>
<p>Founding of Economical Dormitories</p>
<p>The housing problem for single men in the professional and vocational sectors in this city is extremely difficult at this time of housing panic. It is reported that someone has founded an economical dormitory that meets the essential requirements of economy and hygiene. The contact point is the Huining Second Elementary School at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Tenant de la Tour. Professionals and vocational workers are paying close attention because current rents are expensive and it is not easy for single people to rent a place. There are plans to expand the facilities to make them widespread.</p>

<p>Delivering Goods Without Receipts</p>
<p>Each Has Their Own Unspeakable Difficulties</p>
<p>The Case of Heng'an Yarn Store Accused of Embezzlement Concludes</p>
<p>Zhang Houqin, manager of Anle Textile Factory at No. 1, Lane 439, Ningbo Road, from August 17th of last year, had ordered cotton yarn from Dai Ren'an, owner of Heng'an Yarn Store at No. 60, Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, three times, with a total value of 6,417.84 yuan. When the payment was due, Heng'an did not deliver the goods. Anle negotiated with them, but Heng'an claimed that the cotton yarn had already been fully paid for, leading to a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court. During the trial, Dai Ren'an presented a witness, Shen Shende, who testified that the cotton yarn ordered by Anle had been delivered to Anle on unspecified dates at Xin Jing, Ri Xin, and An Shen warehouses, and that Anle transported it with its own truck No. 20469, causing Anle to lose the case. The case had already concluded after three trials. The Anle factory, based on Shen's testimony that the truck's license was still at the Municipal Council's Donation Office at the time, indicating that Dai had intentionally embezzled the goods and colluded with Shen Shende to give false testimony, reported to the Old Zha Police Station. After investigation by detective Zhang Keqin, the report was found to be true, and Dai and Shen were sued in the First Special Court for embezzlement and perjury. They had already been summoned once. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing held a continued hearing. Dai and Shen insisted that the goods had been delivered. The court questioned why Anle was not asked to provide a receipt upon delivery. They replied that because the goods traded were all Japanese goods, it was agreed not to provide receipts. After detailed questioning by Judge Zhong, the court declared the debate closed after mutual arguments between the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu and the defendant's lawyer Jiang Yiping, and a date was set for sentencing.</p>
<p>Qicheng Elementary School Eviction Lawsuit</p>
<p>Second Landlord Loses the Case</p>
<p>The premises of Qicheng Elementary School at No. 235, Xintang Lane, Qipu Road, are subleased from Sun Bodong, residing at No. 14, Qingyuli, Xin Chongqing Road, with a monthly rent of 90 yuan. Sun claimed that the premises he lived in were owned by the Women's Bank, and now the bank was demanding repossession, leaving him without a place to live. Therefore, he demanded that Principal Pang Changnian of Qicheng Elementary School return the subleased premises by the end of July of this year for his own use, but Qicheng Elementary School refused. Sun filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court, stating that because the premises he originally lived in must be vacated, he had no choice but to order the defendant Pang Changnian to return the premises for his own use. After the First Special Court's hearing, it ruled that Pang Changnian should vacate the premises at No. 235, Xintang Lane, Qipu Road, which he rented, by the end of July 1939, and return them to the plaintiff. Pang, dissatisfied with the judgment, hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. The main points of his appeal were that the appellant had notified the appellee of the impending eviction from the premises he lived in four months prior and requested the return of the premises. After negotiations, the appellee agreed to find another place to live, but the rent for the appellant's premises was increased from 90 yuan to 130 yuan per month, and a contract was established. The appellant had paid the rent according to the new agreement and had not defaulted on any rent. Now the appellee was violating the agreement and filing a lawsuit, which was inappropriate. The original trial only investigated the point of repossession for personal use and did not study the point of the new agreement. The appellant was difficult to accept and requested that the original judgment be overturned and the appellee's lawsuit be rejected. This case has been concluded after a hearing by the Second Branch of the High Court, and a judgment has been made. The main points of the judgment are: the original judgment is reversed, the appellee's lawsuit is dismissed, and the costs of the first and second trials are to be borne by the appellee.</p>
<p>Robbery Ring Leader Arrested Awaiting Investigation and Prosecution</p>
<p>Qin Jiquan (also known as Xiao Ge Zhao), a notorious gangster from Funing, 26 years old, residing at No. 8, Lane 82, Hequ Road, was feared like a tiger by residents in the Yangshupu area. On July 21st, at around 9:00 AM, he and four accomplices, including Jin A'er, who had already been arrested and convicted, robbed Wen Lin, a fellow villager, of 150 yuan in legal tender near Lan Road, Hejian Road, along with 14 other accomplices who have not been apprehended. At that time, Jin A'er identified Qin as the leader, but he could not be apprehended. It was not until the afternoon of the day before yesterday that Chinese detective Zhang Guanying of the Yangshupu Police Station arrested this major criminal on Hejian Road and brought him to the police station. The police chief was informed and ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi described the case and requested an extension, stating that investigations revealed that the defendant had led a gang into a flat on Lan Road on May 8th of this year and stolen 33 small packages of cotton yarn worth 231 yuan. Judge Huang Risheng questioned Qin and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further review.</p>
<p>Fake Police Officer Rides Without a Ticket Assaults Ticket Seller with a Mob</p>
<p>Fake Police Officer Refuses to Buy a Ticket, Leading to an Argument</p>
<p>Ticket Seller Dragged Off and Severely Injured with an Axe</p>
<p>A certain No. 7 public bus running in western Shanghai, around 7:30 PM last night, was passing Kang Nao Tuo Road when a fake police officer boarded. Zhu Yiying (30 years old), the local ticket seller, asked him to buy a ticket, but the fake police officer refused, leading to an argument. When the bus reached the vicinity of Jinsi Temple, the fake police officer got off and gathered more than ten accomplices, who swarmed over and dragged Zhu off the bus, pushed him into the temple, and hacked at his chest, ribs, and back with an axe, breaking several ribs. The assailants, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled in a chaotic manner. The injured man was rushed to Baolong Hospital at No. 2046 Gordon Road. It is reported that Zhu's injuries are severe and his life may be in danger.</p>

<p>French Newspaper Reports Details of Priest's Murder</p>
<p>10,000 Yuan Still Intact in Bedroom</p>
<p>Suspects Arrested Show No Leads</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 31st that according to the French Police, the following is a report on the investigation into the assassination of Father Lebe Dang, Director of the Tushanwan Catholic Orphanage: "It is reported that the last person to see Father Lebe Dang alive was around 10:00 AM yesterday morning. At this time, he seemed to have entered his room to rest. The room is upstairs and faces the courtyard. Around 10:30 AM, two people heard a loud noise in his room, as if something had fallen, but no one paid attention to it. At noon, the priests did not see Lebe Dang come out for lunch, and assumed that he had gone out and not returned, and did not find it strange. However, when he still had not returned in the afternoon, they became uneasy. Two priests entered his room and found him bound hand and foot, his body stiff on the bed for a long time. According to police speculation, the ropes used to bind Father Lebe Dang were all from the room, so the assassination does not seem to have been premeditated. The cause of Father Lebe Dang's death was strangulation. It is reported that at the time of the murder, 10,000 yuan in cash was still in Father Lebe Dang's room, intended to pay workers' salaries. However, the 10,000 yuan was still in the iron box, and there were no signs of damage to the iron box. It is also reported that after the incident, Mr. Guo Fumin, President of the French Consular Court, personally went to investigate despite his illness."</p>
<p>Regarding the murder of Father An of the Xujiahui Catholic Church the night before last, the details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the case occurred, the police arrested several suspects, but after interrogation, nothing was discovered, and most seemed to have little relationship with the case. It is also reported that all the cash stored in Father An's room's iron box was untouched, probably because the box had a new-style lock that the criminals could not easily open.</p>
<p>Candy Store Owner Extorted Various Perpetrators Sentenced Separately</p>
<p>Xu Jiru, the Chaozhou owner of Xu Meifeng Candy Store at No. 35, Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession, received a threatening letter on June 30th of this year, containing two bullets, demanding 5,000 yuan, and scheduled a meeting at the Guanle Tea Room on Avenue Joffre the next day to negotiate the payment, otherwise, they would use drastic measures. Xu reported this to the French Police, who arrested Chaozhou natives Wang Zhen, Chen Jinyu, Huang Shuncheng, Huang Ruocun, Xu Jiabin, Chen Aji, Chen Jinyu, and Li Zhiye, a total of eight people, and sent them all to the Second Special Court for investigation. During the court hearing, the defendants claimed that the plaintiff, Xu Jiru, was responsible for a certain food supply, and had made huge profits, so they sent a letter to warn him, and there was no extortion involved. The plaintiff, Xu Jiru, also hired a lawyer to file a civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering compensation for mental damages of one yuan in national currency. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The case has been concluded after a trial by President Liao, and yesterday it was sentenced by Judge Miao Qingbang acting as an agent. Wang Zhen was sentenced to six months imprisonment for joint extortion, Chen Jinyu, Huang Shuncheng, Huang Ruocun, and Xu Jiabin were sentenced to four months imprisonment for the same crime, and Chen Aji, Chen Jinyu, and Li Zhiye were found not guilty. The plaintiff's attached civil suit was dismissed.</p>
<p>Son of Secretary of the Ministry of Justice Couple Files for Divorce Woman Demands 10,000 Yuan in Alimony Both Parties Hold Their Ground Court Orders Further Summons</p>
<p>Wang Yiche, a 31-year-old graduate from Jiading, currently residing at No. 6, Tingyun Lane, Lane 128, Fuli Road in the French Concession, is the son of Wang Junshan (Zi Zhiyi), the current Secretary of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. In 1931, he married Yan Shaolin (26 years old this year), also from his hometown, through a matchmaker. The couple's love was initially harmonious, but later, Wang engaged in extramarital affairs, leading to a rift in the couple's feelings. Yan Shaolin left Wang's residence and returned to Ningbo, and Wang ignored her. Recently, Yan Shaolin commissioned lawyers Jiang Zongpan and Tao Yimin to file a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court for Wang Yiche to mediate a divorce. The petition stated that the opposing party was dissolute and acquainted with women outside, and had developed bad habits, indulging in the world of prostitution. The petitioner's private savings were forcibly taken and used. On January 20th of this year, the opposing party voluntarily wrote a letter of repentance, breaking off relations with the mistress and giving up bad habits. However, he did not repent and abandoned the petitioner. He stopped paying the 50 yuan monthly living expenses after February, and now she is forced to request a mediation for divorce, and order him to pay 10,000 yuan in living expenses, and return a diamond ring, jade bracelet, pearl necklace, gem-encrusted ring, rhinestone ring, and gold watch each, a grey squirrel cheongsam, and 200 yuan in cash. The court, according to the petition, opened a court for mediation. Because the opposing party Wang Yiche did not attend, it was declared that the mediation was unsuccessful. Yan Shaolin, still commissioning lawyers Jiang and Tao according to the reasons for requesting mediation, filed a formal lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting a judgment approving the divorce, and ordering him to pay the above-mentioned living expenses, and return each item. The court, according to the petition, convened both parties for trial in the Civil Seventh Court yesterday morning by Judge Ma Yishu. The plaintiff Yan Shaolin, accompanied by agents Jiang and Tao, appeared in court and stated the previous situation. The defendant commissioned a lawyer to appear in court, requesting that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected, and stated that the defendant admitted to writing the letter of repentance and acknowledgement, but that the opium addiction was due to illness, and he had now quit. When the plaintiff returned to Ningbo, he sent her letters asking her to come back, but she ignored him. The court examined the words and advised the plaintiff and defendant to reconcile. Yan Shaolin said that the defendant had not returned home for more than a year, and it was difficult to see his face. The judge also asked the plaintiff, "Where did you get the 10,000 yuan in living expenses you are requesting?" She replied, "This is stated in the defendant's letter of repentance, and now the defendant has violated the agreement and should be pursued for compensation." The plaintiff's lawyer then presented the defendant's letter of repentance and photos taken with the mistress as evidence. After the lawyers for both sides stated the reasons and opinions held by both sides, the court examined the situation and ordered a change of date, summoning the defendant himself to appear in court for further questioning.</p>

<p>Reflections on the Revival of "Tears on the Flowers" (Part 1) By Yu Ling</p>
<p>In the midst of a fierce wind and driving rain, friends from the Shanghai Drama Society braved the elements to visit, discussing the revival of "Tears on the Flowers." Speaking of the Drama Society's recent difficulties, even though I am not "Flowers," I almost "shed tears," and was left in silent dismay.</p>
<p>Returning after seeing them off, alone with the lamp and rain-streaked window, a myriad of feelings welled up. Gripping my pen, my thoughts wandered, and I was unable to begin writing for a long time.</p>
<p>I remember "Tears on the Flowers" being written during a pleasant process. Last winter, it was performed under conditions of mental and physical exhaustion, followed by a weakened state of illness. The subsequent second and third performances at the New Light Theater, and the fourth charity performance at the Golden Grand Theater, were all truncated, only two acts being performed, which I also found rather unpleasant. I never imagined that this time, the Drama Society would be in less than ideal circumstances for its revival.</p>
<p>"Tears on the Flowers," an emblem of unpleasantness! Is it because the line "Feeling the times, flowers draw tears; Resenting separation, birds alarm the heart" from Du Fu's poem is fundamentally an age-old omen of ill fortune? Or is it that theatrical movements in this beleaguered island are unlikely to have joyful times and events until dawn breaks? Though I am often disappointed in people, I am never pessimistic about things. However, tonight, the emotions stirred by the experiences of "Tears on the Flowers" do not allow me to feel particularly enthusiastic, despite my naturally passionate nature!</p>
<p>Naturally, "In the past, it was enthusiasm that propelled us forward; recently, it is reason that dictates our actions." These are words I wrote myself during the first performance of "Tears on the Flowers" last year. Therefore, my so-called lack of enthusiasm tonight cannot be taken to mean that I no longer want "Tears on the Flowers," this ugly child of my own creation; nor does it mean that I want the friends of the Shanghai Drama Society to give up the revival of "Tears on the Flowers." I know that past unpleasantness was often due to the Drama Society facing terrible difficulties, and my friends also know that I would rather be unhappy myself than not help the Drama Society overcome or get through its current difficulties. For example, the second and third performances were because the script rehearsed by the Drama Society could not pass censorship. Unable to change the repertoire at the last minute, and with the New Light Theater's early Sunday time slot unable to accommodate four acts, we once again truncated it into two acts as a stopgap measure. (Originally five acts, even the first performance could only manage four.) The fourth performance was rehearsed by the dancers of the Mutual Aid Theater Group. Firstly, there were not enough sisters who could act in spoken drama; secondly, the performance time had to be limited, as a longer performance would interfere with their dancing, which was crucial for their livelihoods. Therefore, after discussing with the director, Miss Lan Lan, I agreed. Moreover, it was a joint charity sale, with the performance aimed at providing disaster relief! So, with repeated truncations and cuts to the script, how could I object, even if it was unpleasant for me?</p>
<h3>On Storytelling</h3>
<p>By Yan Chengxi</p>
<p>Grand stories possess vigor, while short stories carry sentiment. It is evident that grand stories rely entirely on vigor. However, getting straight to the point without musical accompaniment to borrow from makes it challenging to plan well. Hence, one often hears storytellers of grand stories say it is difficult and unrewarding. While this is indeed the unfortunate fate of grand storytelling, in reality, grand stories are often about stirring and impassioned tales, and Shanghai desperately needs invigorating grand stories!</p>
<p>To tell a grand story in a way that piques the audience's interest and avoids sounding like a lecture or reciting, is not an easy task. Generally, the storyteller needs sufficient inner strength (meaning vigor, not superficiality), a cultivated knowledge base, a clear narrative structure, moving plots, vivid characterizations, expressive facial expressions, and a sonorous voice, supplemented by clever gags to fully captivate the audience. However, there are not many who possess all these abilities today. Individuals like Huang Zhaolin and Yang Lianqing are already among the best in this field, indicating that telling grand stories is indeed difficult.</p>
<p>Listening to stories is primarily about hearing jokes and laughing, but it can also allow compelling narratives to revive your fading spirits or elicit a knowing smile. In today's Shanghai, this seems more meaningful than short stories.</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Relief Authorities to Hold a Qipai All-Star Performance</h3>
<p>By Zhibai</p>
<p>In the past half-year, the Beijing theater scene has held several "All-Star Clown Performances" and "All-Star Painted Face Performances." For example, in the All-Star Clown Performance, famous clowns such as Xiao Changhua, Ci Ruiquan, Ma Fulu, Ye Shengzhang, Cao Ergeng, and Ru Fuhui all participated, each performing one excerpt. (Ye Shengzhang headlined). Similarly, the All-Star Painted Face Performance featured renowned painted face actors from the north, such as Hao Shouchun, Hou Xirui, Jin Shaoshan, Liu Lianle, Qiu Shengrong, and Li Chunheng, all putting on full painted face performances. (Jin Shaoshan typically headlined the Painted Face All-Star Performance). This was not only an unprecedented event but also a novel undertaking. Therefore, each performance caused a sensation throughout the city, enjoying immense popularity.</p>
<p>While Shanghai's theater scene also boasts many famous actors, the scarcity of clown and painted face talents makes it impossible to replicate Beijing's all-star format. (Even if possible, it would be difficult to organize). However, aside from all-star clown and painted face performances, the Shanghai theater scene could emulate the example of the former capital by holding a Qipai All-Star Performance.</p>
<p>The Qipai style was once very popular in Shanghai and boasts a wealth of talent. A performance would undoubtedly attract a large audience. I will now propose a tentative program for this performance:</p>
<p>Li Ruchun (Ma Yi) *Nine Watch Hours*</p>
<p>Xu Hongpei (Xu Ce) *Running the City*</p>
<p>Yang Baotong (Wu Han) *Beheading at the Sutra Hall*</p>
<p>Wang Chunbai (Xue Li) *Phoenix Mountain*</p>
<p>Xu Hongpei (Liu Bang)</p>
<p>Gao Baisui (Xiang Yu) *Gate*</p>
<p>Zhou Xinfang (Fan Zeng) *Hong*</p>
<p>Chen Hefeng (Zhang Liang) *Banquet*</p>
<p>Li Ruchun (Xiang Bo)</p>
<p>Chen Hefeng (Xue Pinggui) *Farewell to the Kiln*</p>
<p>Gao Baisui (Zou Yinglong) *Beating Yan Song*</p>
<p>Wang Chunbai (Han Xin) *Han*</p>
<p>Zhou Xinfang (Xiao He) *Chase*</p>
<p>Yang Baotong (Liu Bang) *Xin*</p>
<p>The above program can be described as "splendid." Judging by the roles, "Hongmen Banquet" could headline. However, since Xinfang's "Chasing Han Xin" has always been a closing act, "Hongmen Banquet" is placed earlier. Because only Baisui can play Xiang Yu in "Hongmen Banquet," Chunbai is used for Han Xin in "Chasing Han Xin" instead of Baisui. Baisui, Hefeng, and Xinfang jointly performing "Chasing Han Xin" was a frequent sight in the old Tianchan era. Seeing Chunbai and Baotong perform "Chasing Han Xin" together would be a first and feel fresh. Fan Zeng is a very important character in "Hongmen Banquet." Xinfang has long wanted to play Fan Zeng but has never had the opportunity, and Fan Zeng's personality is difficult to portray. Other actors would not be up to the task, so it is better to assign it to Xinfang. Hefeng is better suited for Zhang Liang than for Fan Zeng.</p>
<p>The above program could run for six and a half to seven hours. The Pear Garden Association could use it as a benefit performance. However, I believe it would be best if the relief authorities could turn this ideal into reality and use the Qipai All-Star Performance as a charity performance to aid refugees. I believe it would have a broad impact and achieve remarkable results.</p>
<h3>Another Interpretation of "An Kang"</h3>
<p>By Danran</p>
<p>We all know that Mr. Tianxu Wosheng is a man of many talents. His recent research on "An Kang" is naturally based on evidence and not mere conjecture. However, according to what I know, the term "An Kang" has another interpretation.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, when I was working in Hangzhou, I was walking down Pishi Lane with my deceased friend Mr. Wang one day when I saw a red paper sign posted on a door that read "An Kang承接处" [An Kang Accepting Services]. I asked Mr. Wang what this meant. Mr. Wang was a native of Hangzhou (his ancestors were Mongols who had lived in Hangzhou for eight generations, so I always jokingly called him "Wang Eight Generations") and a scholar of both ancient and modern times. I thought he would know, so I asked him. As expected, he not only knew but also made a side income from "An Kang." According to Mr. Wang, the term "An Kang" was simply a transliteration of "Tan Huang" [Shanghai local opera]. "An" rhymes with "Tan," and "Kang" rhymes with "Huang." Tan Huang performers (people in Hangzhou call Tan Huang singers "Mr.," so there are many genuine "Mr." figures among them) considered the term Tan Huang to be inelegant, so they gave it another name. Following the general practice of using double consonants or rhyming characters to represent a name (there are many such examples, especially common in lower society, while in upper society, one can take the example of Qing dynasty, where people use "Ting Meng" [汀萌] to cut the phrase "Tian Ming" [天明], and used it to tease Gu Tinglin.), they used "An Kang." The real meaning is using the sound of the two characters, not the meaning of the two characters. Initially, it was just the sound of "An Kang" that represented "Tan Huang," but over time, it was written as "An Kang."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was originally from an official family, but after the revolution, his family fell into decline. He was also naturally lazy and fond of wine, so he had no way to make a living. He became a formal "Mr." by joining the Zhengshi Society and studying with a certain "Mr." I think his words are somewhat reliable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Tan Huang is not only found in Hangzhou, but also in various other places. If it is said to be a transliteration of Wen Tianxiang's "Tai Huang," how would one explain Tan Huang in other regions? As for the true origins of Tan Huang, someone has already researched it, so I need not elaborate further.</p>

<h3>Entertainment Doesn't Forget Disaster Relief: Sketches of a Charity Dance</h3>
<p>By Boeing</p>
<p>In view of the soaring rice prices and the difficulties in providing relief to refugees, the dance hall committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association launched a charity dance competition in order to raise funds. With the enthusiastic support of dance halls and dance stars, the "Charity Dance" finally began on the afternoon of the 29th at the Yunshang Dance Hall.</p>
<p>The lineup for the Charity Dance was quite strong. In addition to Association President Mr. Yu Qiaqing opening the event and film star Miss Chen Yunshang cutting the ribbon, stars such as Bai Hong, Mei Xi, Han Lan, Yao Yinxiu, Cen Liujun, Zhang Zhizhi, and Hong Jingling performed wonderful programs. All the dance stars of the hall participated in free dancing.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Jiang Yiping were among the first to enter the venue. Then, Zhang Shankun accompanied Misses Chen Yunshang and Li Minghui, who were greeted with enthusiastic applause. Mr. Yu Qiaqing arrived shortly after, and the opening ceremony took place to the tune of jazz music. Mr. Yu delivered a brief speech, and Miss Chen Yunshang, with a warm smile, performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The Charity Dance was then declared open, and guests took to the dance floor. Under the slogan "Entertainment Doesn't Forget Disaster Relief," dancing took on a deeper meaning today.</p>
<p>It is worth praising the ladies of the Dance Industry and Dancers Association. They showed courage, enthusiasm and willing to sacrifice their own tea dance business, braving the wind and rain to arrive early.</p>
<p>Shortly after the dance began, an astonishing announcement came over the microphone: Mr. Wang Shiping, known as Third Master Wang, generously donated 1,000 yuan to the relief fund. Miss Chen Yunshang, to encourage Mr. Wang's enthusiasm, offered to dance with him, but Mr. Wang politely declined. Then, guests began donating to request songs from the stars. Donations poured in, and Han Lagen, Yin Xiumei, Liu Jijun, Bai Hua, Zhang Zhizhi, and Hong Jingling were extremely busy performing many wonderful programs. Adding to the fun, one guest offered to donate 40 yuan to request Yin the Fat and Han the Thin to dance together. Normally, dance halls prohibit two men from dancing, but an exception was made because of the disaster relief donations. Finally, the guests raised the donation to 140 yuan, and the two Oriental Laurel and Hardy finally took to the dance floor, causing all the guests to laugh uncontrollably. In all, the donations for song requests reached around 500 yuan, lottery tickets around 600-700 yuan, and ticket sales over 600 yuan, totaling around 3,000 yuan including Third Master Wang's 1,000 yuan. The small Yunshang Dance Hall was able to achieve such results, which is enough to satisfy us.</p>
<p>According to the author, the second Charity Dance will be held at the Lido Dance Hall within a week, and more satisfying results will be displayed.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's "Da Di's" First Shot: "Orphan Island Paradise" Achieves Success</h3>
<p>By Dani</p>
<p>– "Hometown of White Clouds" is also Filming</p>
<p>Hong Kong Da Di Film Arts Company's first production is "Orphan Island Paradise." This magazine has already reported on it, and now it has been fully completed. The whole film is twice as long as ordinary films (ordinary films are about 8,000-9,000 feet to 10,000 feet), and the cost is more than 30,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is between 110,000 and 120,000 at the current price of legal currency. It can be said to be a film made with "huge capital." The film is directed by Mr. Cai Chusheng. After leaving Shanghai, Mr. Cai left behind a "Bachelor Wang" that he no longer recognizes as his own work. Shanghai audiences miss his whereabouts. In the early stages of "Orphan Island Paradise," it was prepared to take the Shanghai route, so the content was mainly based on conditions suitable for Shanghai performances. Just look at the characters in this film to know Cai Chusheng's painstaking efforts in compiling it. There is a dancer who lost her hometown (Li Lili), a "mysterious" young man (Li Qing), a foreign-educated young master (Hong Hong), a mainland young lady (Bai Lu), a landlord (Jiang Ming), a dumb person (Li Jingbo), and a fool (Lan Ma).</p>
<p>The Hong Kong premiere date is about mid-month. According to a friend's letter, a grand premiere ceremony will be held. However, when it will be shipped to Shanghai has not yet been decided; as soon as it is decided, it will be reported to readers at any time.</p>
<p>Attached is the news of Da Di's new film. The second film directed by Situ Huimin, "Hometown of White Clouds," has already started filming. Fei Mu's "Heavenly Music Beyond" has also begun. Judging from the titles, these films may also be shipped to Shanghai for public screenings. Amidst the sounds of "burning," this is somewhat exciting good news for us.</p>
<p>Attached is a still, so that those who care about our artists can take a look at it first.</p>

<h3>Chen Gexin Initiates and Organizes an Orchestra</h3>
<p>By Tianma</p>
<p>Starting Today, a Concert at the Xindu Radio Station</p>
<p>Chen Gexin, a young musician famous for composing music, was also a prominent essayist in the literary world in the past. Now, in addition to setting up schools to teach music and singing, it is rare for him to write articles for newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>It's a sudden news that Chen Gexin is busy at the Xindu Hotel selecting foreign musicians staying in Shanghai and female singers who are proficient in singing and dancing to organize a large orchestra, which will be publicly performed at the Xindu Glass Radio Station and Night Garden from September 1st.</p>
<p>The reporter specially interviewed Mr. Chen. According to him, the preparations for this matter are about to be completed. The organization of this orchestra has been planned for a long time. In order to improve the level of music in Shanghai, and to promote new types of singing and dancing art, he is holding unlimited hopes.</p>
<p>Chen Gexin's literary cultivation is quite good. He is fluent in Russian, French, English, and Italian. Since dedicating himself to music after graduation, his reputation has risen sharply. The Sino-French Drama School and the Star Acting Training Institute have both invited him to be a professor. His song and dance drama "Poppy Flower" shocked the art world and pioneered a new path for Chinese song and dance. Various famous film companies also competed to hire him to compose music. Therefore, in the minds of Shanghai people, Chen Gexin's music is deeply imprinted in their minds.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Peking Opera World</h3>
<p>By Xu Muyun</p>
<p>New Theaters Have Superstitions About Opening and Breaking the Stage</p>
<p>Therefore, he was not very happy when he arrived here, because his apprentice Shan Deyuan was a martial arts actor, and around the time of the Republic of China, true sword and spear martial arts operas were popular everywhere, such as "Three Volumes of Iron Rooster" and "Tazigou." In the last scene, when the martial arts actor playing the supporting role fell on the stage, the protagonist often threw a sharp short blade (shaped like a dagger) near the fallen actor's ear. Accurate performers were like throwing ge wen in the "Golden Leopard" drama. The knife entered the plank about an inch, only a hair's breadth from the ear. Moreover, the fallen actor was at the stage entrance, and the thrower was outside the entrance on the upper stage. A slight carelessness would cause it to fall into the orchestra pit, which was extremely dangerous for the audience. For this reason, Meng asked the theater owner to hold a grand ceremony of breaking the stage, piously burning incense, hoping for the protection of the ancestral masters and the expulsion of evil spirits, so that he and his apprentice could perform with peace of mind. The theater owner was extremely stingy, privately thinking that the stage was not newly built. Although it had been suspended for a long time in the middle, there was no need to hold a second stage-breaking ceremony to avoid wasting money. However, the theater owner had long heard that Meng was upright, and since he had already spoken, there was no way to refuse. He only secretly saved money so that Meng would not find out, and perfunctorily dealt with the matter.</p>
<p>According to the custom of breaking the stage, all the martial arts actors had to dress up as various strange forms of demons and monsters, holding various weapons from the toolbox, jumping and shouting wildly on the stage, with red lights burning high and firecrackers set off. The crowd marched in formation, circling several times through the front and back of the stage, the audience seats on both sides, and the upstairs. However, before the people held weapons, they always first dipped chicken blood, black dog blood, cinnabar, and other things on the weapons, and then used them to chop randomly at the tables, chairs, props, stage boards, walls, and other places on the stage. Blood and cinnabar can drive away evil spirits, so there are no evil spirits in the places that are chopped. (9/1)</p>
<h3>Zhu Xinggong's Funeral Today - The Ta Mei Evening News Offers Generous Support to the Bereaved Family - Establishes a Funeral Committee to Handle the Aftermath</h3>
<p>Zhu Xinggong, an editor of the "Night Light" section of the Ta Mei Evening News, left his residence on North Henan Road at 4:20 PM the day before yesterday, intending to go to the office. Unexpectedly, when he reached the vicinity of North Henan Road and Tiantong Road, he was suddenly attacked by three thugs who shot and killed him, hitting vital points. News of his tragic death caused deep mourning in all circles. The newspaper immediately established a funeral committee and allocated a large sum of money to handle the funeral arrangements. It also approved the continued monthly payment of his original salary to support his family. It is also reported that someone has telegraphed the central government to request a posthumous commendation and pension. It is said that a telegram arrived from Chongqing yesterday, stating that Mr. Zhu had promoted justice, attacked fallacies, and remained loyal to the country throughout his life, serving as a model of integrity, and therefore approval could be expected. Mr. Zhu's remains are scheduled to be placed in a coffin at the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road at 3:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Arrested Assassin Confesses to the Murder - Every afternoon, Mr. Zhu would carry the edited drafts of the supplements from his residence to the newspaper office for printing. Before the tragedy, Zhu left his residence and was walking leisurely when, within a dozen steps, three thugs jumped out from the roadside, blocking Zhu's path. One of them immediately raised a gun and fired at Zhu. Ironically, the bullet was jammed, causing the first two shots to fail to fire. With the third shot, however, there was a loud bang, and a bullet flew out, piercing Zhu's temple. After being shot, Zhu immediately fell to the ground severely wounded. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the three thugs immediately fled. At that moment, a patrol car happened to be approaching. One of the armed thugs was captured and taken to the Huishi Police Station that evening. The suspect immediately confessed to the assassination but refused to explain his motives. He was later transferred to the General Police Station, where he admitted that there were two other accomplices on the run. Regarding the firearms used in the assassination, a Western newspaper reported that it was a revolver, which had been inspected by the police and found to be the same as the one used in the assassination of Wang Jilu. However, according to information obtained by the English-language Ta Mei Evening News, the weapon has not yet been inspected by the police, and the suspect remains detained at the General Police Station, not yet transferred to the court.</p>
<p>Funeral Committee Established to Handle Aftermath - After being shot, Mr. Zhu was immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but due to the bullet hitting a vital point, he died despite all efforts to save him. After the body was transferred to the Jiaozhou Road coroner's office for examination this morning, Zhu's wife, He Liying, claimed it on the spot. The car then proceeded to the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road. The Board of Directors of the Ta Mei Evening News recognized Mr. Zhu's martyrdom for the country and specifically established a funeral committee to handle the aftermath. The encoffining has been scheduled for 3:00 PM this afternoon. Mr. Zhu's coffin has already been purchased for a total of 1,001 yuan, all borne by the newspaper. A burial plot has also been selected in the Hongqiao Cemetery in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ta Mei Evening News Offers Generous Support to the Bereaved Family - Mr. Zhu's family includes an elder brother named Zhenxia, who is a government official in Chongqing, a wife named He Liying, and a seven-year-old son named Yongyong. The family's financial situation is extremely difficult. The funeral committee has decided to request people from all walks of life who wish to offer condolences to contribute cash instead of gifts, which will be collected by the newspaper's distribution department to fund the education of Mr. Zhu's son. The committee will also organize and publish Mr. Zhu's works, and the resulting royalties will be given to the bereaved family. The Ta Mei Evening News will also treat Mr. Zhu's death as a work-related death. In addition to covering the funeral expenses, the newspaper will continue to pay Mr. Zhu's monthly salary to the bereaved family until Yongyong grows up, at which point he will be allowed to work in the newspaper.</p>

<h3>Despite Extradition, Four Chinese in Tianjin Still File Habeas Corpus Petition - Expected to be Filed with the British Assessor's Office This Morning</h3>
<p>Sir Mo Su Returned to Shanghai to Hear the Case - The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reports that regarding the case of the assassination attempt in Tianjin, the four suspects Zhao Heng, Zhao Xing, Zhao Ru, and Li Dexiang (all transliterated names) are likely to be extradited or handed over to the de facto authorities in Tianjin today (the 31st). It is expected that they will file a third petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the British Assessor's Office in Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 1st). The race against time seems to have failed. The British Consul-General in Tianjin received a telegram from the British government a few days ago, instructing the British Municipal Council to hand over the four men. The de facto Tianjin District Court has issued arrest warrants, and the procedures have been completed. It is expected that the four men were extradited last night. However, Shanghai has not yet received confirmation of the extradition. Meanwhile, the Shanghai law firm of Ellis &amp; Hays has received a telegram from the four suspects and, two days ago, submitted the suspects' affidavits to the British Assessor's Office here.</p>
<p>Assessor Sir Mo Su recently left Shanghai for vacation but is expected to return to the port today, after which he will immediately hear the petition. Ellis &amp; Hays expects the hearing to take place tomorrow, or be postponed due to typhoons or other circumstances, but no later than September 4. The date of the hearing reported to the London representative, the law firm of Aires &amp; Payne Hall, is also September 4. The four men in Tianjin have not been charged with any crime. It is reported that they were only interrogated by the Tianjin British Concession Police Department, who suspected them of involvement in the murder. British troops stationed in Tianjin have been guarding the four men.</p>
<h3>The Truth Behind Crowe's Murder - Western Newspapers Investigate - Say It Was Due to Non-Compliance with Inspection Regulations</h3>
<p>Police Authorities Unclear on Motives for Assassination - The Miller's Review reports that of all the incidents and acts of violence experienced by Chinese and foreign citizens in Shanghai since the Japanese began their aggression two years ago, none has been more infuriating than the assassination of Crowe of the Great Northern Telegraph Company. Crowe was a Danish citizen, 39 years old, and captain of Company A of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. On the morning of August 18, he was shot by thugs in the "badlands" area and died en route to the hospital. The perpetrators escaped into the "badlands" area,</p>
<p>leaving no trace. The Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession was unable to apprehend them or determine the motives for the assassination. However, a Japanese military newspaper in this city published a message suggesting the motives for the crime and the real perpetrators. According to the Japanese newspaper, Crowe, in his capacity as captain of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, once tore down the "Great Way" five-color flag from the Daxilu Police Station, which had been closed by the Public Concession authorities. Crowe denied this accusation.</p>
<p>Rumors have recently circulated that Crowe was assassinated because he refused to comply with the Japanese inspection regulations implemented at the telegraph company in this city. This news has not been reported by foreign newspapers in this city. It is reported that Crowe, as director of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, took steps to prevent Japanese inspectors stationed at the company's office at 34 Edward Road from inspecting and hindering telegrams sent by the company. After the Japanese occupied the Shanghai area, the Japanese authorities immediately sent inspectors to the general offices of the three foreign telegraph companies. Protests by the British, American, and Danish consuls were ineffective. Foreign businessmen believe that if the telegraph authorities and foreign businesses take resolute</p>
<p>action, rather than developing wireless businesses that are not subject to Japanese interference, they can drive out the Japanese inspectors. It is reported that the telegraph company itself has taken steps to avoid the harmful actions of the inspectors, such as delaying telegrams and disclosing their contents to rival Japanese businesses. Rumors suggest that the assassination of Crowe stemmed from this situation.</p>
<h3>French Business Increases Water and Electricity Fees - Temporary in Nature</h3>
<p>Effective from the 6th - Already Advertised</p>
<p>Already Advertised - The French-owned Tramway and Electric Lighting Company in this city recently reported that due to soaring fuel prices, it has been approved by the French Municipal Council at its meeting on August 25 of this year to temporarily increase the electricity fees for electric lights, electricity, and electric heating by 60% (including the previous increase of 15% for electric light fees and 25% for electricity and electric heating fees) from September 6 of this year. All tap water fees within the concession will also be temporarily increased by 10% from September 6 of this year. In addition, tram and bus fares will also be increased across the board. Detailed new price lists have been posted on each vehicle and have been advertised to the public.</p>
<h3>Clear Weather After the Typhoon - Shipping Resumes Normal Operations</h3>
<p>Qingdao Has Been Hit Hard by the Wind</p>
<p>European Situation Not Relaxed - The typhoon that detained Ou Ju, Wei Lian, and Gai Sa in Shanghai has passed, and the weather has been clear since yesterday, with shipping returning to normal. Import and export ships are operating as usual. The Shanghai-based steamers operating on the lower Yangtze River Beisha Line and the Xingang (Jingjiang)-Nantong Line, such as Lisha, Haiyi, Luan, and Kaisideng, resumed sailing last night. The Deyao is scheduled to depart at 7:00 AM this morning. Although the Taikoo Company's Wulin is already in Shanghai, the company has no news on when it will resume its schedule. The Jardine Matheson's Tonghe did not enter port yesterday, reportedly because the Beisha cargo was not loaded due to the typhoon the day before. It is scheduled to sail to Sanhe Port today to load and unload cargo and return to Shanghai this afternoon, resuming sailing to Beisha tomorrow morning. Jiangding, Haikang, and other ships are also expected to return to Shanghai today. The Guisheng, Lisheng, Hunan, Qingyuan, and other ships, which have been delayed for many days, and the British mail ship Kashgar, all departed in succession yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Italian Mail Awaits Orders and Temporarily Suspends Sailing - The Italian Mail Company's Rulian Gaisa (transliterated) did not depart yesterday. Due to the situation in Europe, it is feared that it will be slightly delayed in Shanghai while awaiting orders from the head office. The American Steamship Company's President Pierce entered port at 6:00 AM yesterday and berthed at buoys 12 and 13. It is scheduled to weigh anchor at 8:45 AM this morning and proceed to Hong Kong and Little Luzon. The passenger transfer launch is scheduled to depart from the Customs Pier at 7:15 AM this morning.</p>
<p>French Mail Ship Qinlabao Has Sailed to Shanghai - The French Mail Company's mail ship Qinlabao, which sailed from Marseille to the Far East this time, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. Due to the tense situation in Europe, the ship was ordered by the head office to temporarily dock in Saigon after reaching that port, suspending its voyage to Shanghai. According to news from the French company in this city yesterday, the ship has now departed from Saigon and should pass through Hong Kong today and arrive in Shanghai in three days.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Have Scheduled Sailings - The Helford, of the shipping department of the German company Lishi &amp; Co., will depart for Zhenhai this afternoon. The Baoli, of the Italian company Yihua &amp; Co., which was originally scheduled to depart for Zhenhai yesterday, was also delayed by the typhoon and will now depart for Zhenhai at 4:00 PM today. The ships anchored outside the Zhenhai estuary, such as the Ender, Moufu, Hana, and Deping, also sailed to the Jintang waters to avoid the wind starting the day before yesterday. This morning, they began sailing back outside the blockade line to continue loading and unloading passengers and cargo. Their sailing schedules are arranged as follows: the Ender will unload first and then come to Shanghai, followed by the Moufu, then the Hana, and finally the Deping, in that order.</p>
<p>Qingdao Has Been Touched by the Wings of the Typhoon - After the wind swept through Shanghai in the early hours of the day before yesterday and headed towards the Yellow Sea, the Xujiahui Observatory reported at 8:00 AM yesterday that the typhoon had reached 35.30 degrees north latitude and 120.30 degrees east longitude, with the center within 30 nautical miles, heading due north, and the wind force still fierce. According to the reported coordinates, the typhoon was only 30 nautical miles southeast of Qingdao, and its impact was almost inevitable. The Qingdao meteorological report received yesterday morning stated that the outer edge of the storm had already made contact, with wind forces of 9 to 10.</p>
<p>Warehouse Notice to Prevent High Tides - Recently, it has been the time of high autumn tides, and the city has been hit by a fierce typhoon, causing low-lying areas to be flooded. The Xinzhan Warehouse, the Weilihuan Company's Roosevelt Wharf Warehouse, and the 13 bank warehouses of China Communications, etc., although their warehouses are located in high positions and have flood prevention equipment, the typhoon's water level rose and fell so unpredictably that manpower could not resist it. To prepare for the worst, they specifically notified all cargo owners yesterday to find other ways to stack their goods.</p>
<h3>Broadcast of the Dutch Queen's Birthday - Speech on European Peace - Yesterday Was Her 59th Birthday - Dutch Community in This City Celebrated Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>Dutch Community in This City Celebrated Enthusiastically - Yesterday was the 59th birthday of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. The Dutch community in this city held enthusiastic celebrations. The Dutch Consul in Shanghai, Dr. Van, hosted a banquet at his private residence at 753 Yuyuan Road from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM yesterday to celebrate with the Dutch community. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands is the only reigning female monarch in the world. At a time when the world is troubled and the situation in Europe is urgent, on the occasion of her 59th birthday, the Queen is joining King Leopold of Belgium in consulting with the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Poland, and other countries on a peace movement. The Queen also made a surprising peace speech broadcast yesterday. The Queen was born on August 31, 1880, the daughter of William III's second wife. When her father the king passed away, the Queen was only ten years old (in 1890). She was crowned queen on September 6, 1898 (at the age of eighteen). On February 7, 1901, she married Prince Henry, who passed away on July 3, 1934. The Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), the Dutch West Indies (Curaçao), and other regions are all under the Queen's jurisdiction. The Netherlands is currently peaceful, and its politics are very enlightened.</p>
<p>Important Figures from All Walks of Life Attended the Celebration - The Continental Press reports that the Dutch Consul-General in Shanghai, Bausen, will hold a reception at his residence at 753 Yuyuan Road from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM this evening (the 31st) to commemorate the 59th birthday of the Queen of the Netherlands. In addition to the Dutch community in Shanghai, guests attending will include diplomatic and consular officials, as well as many prominent Chinese and foreign figures.</p>
<p>Joining Belgium in Mediating the European Situation - On the eve of her birthday, the Queen of the Netherlands, together with the Belgian government, proposed to the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, and Poland that they mediate the dispute between Germany and Poland. Observers believe that the Netherlands and Belgium, as neutral countries, should mediate disputes that threaten the entire world peace mechanism.</p>
<h3>Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes - Request Already Telegraphed to Chongqing - Reply Expected Soon and Will Be Complied With</h3>
<p>No Word of Fractional Currency Tokens - Regarding the issue of fractional currency notes, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has telegraphed the head office in Chongqing to request instructions. Once the reply is received in Shanghai, the bank will comply with the instructions. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, in view of the needs of the market, urgently wants to issue fractional currency notes as soon as possible to provide relief. The decision to postpone the issuance is entirely for the sake of caution. It is expected that the head office's reply will arrive in Shanghai soon. Rumors of the banking industry's plan to issue fractional currency tokens have not been heard by either the Bankers Association or the Money Dealers Association.</p>
<p>Measures to Redeem Substitute Postal Stamps - The First Special District Citizens' Union in this city believes that the issue of substitute postal stamps has not been resolved, and merchants and citizens alike feel deeply inconvenienced before the government's fractional currency notes are issued. Moreover, the abuse of substitute currency is bound to lead to future troubles. It is proposed that public groups jointly form a Postal Stamp Substitute Currency Management Committee, which will issue several tens of thousands of yuan of substitute postal stamps to circulate in the market and redeem and recover them at any time in order to alleviate the difficulty of lacking small change.</p>
<p>Much Sympathy from All Quarters - Since this news was published, there has been much sympathy from all quarters. The Union is now actively drafting measures and the organizational outline of the committee in order to formally submit proposals to the public groups and solicit their opinions in the coming days.</p>
