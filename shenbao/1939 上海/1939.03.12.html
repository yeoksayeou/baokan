<p>今天是中華民國國父孫中山先生的逝世十四週紀念日。在這個時候，孫先生所手創的中華民國正在極度的苦難中挣扎着；孫先生窀穸所安的鍾山陵墓，也已被鬼魅們盤踞着一年又三個月了，每一個中國國民今天都不免抱着無限的愴痛！尤其是孤島市民們，今天卽使要把最平常的植樹方式來紀念孫先生，也遭受了槍尖刺刀的限制，無從跑到四郊去，這更是一件如何可以悲憤的事！然而，單憑着情感上的愴痛與悲憤來紀念國父，有什麼用呢？</p>
<p>孫中山先生逝世已經十四年，這十四年也就是中華民國，創建到今的一半時間。在這一半時間裏，中國正遭逢着孫先生在世所不及見，然而也早在他意料中的危難情况。孫先生指示信徒與國民們的種種教訓，正是根據着這種正確預料而設計的一切解决方案。如果孫先生還生在今日，他所給與中國國民的指示也惟有抗戰，因爲只有抗戰才能夠完成孫先生所畢生致力的「中國之自由平等」。凡是歷史上最偉大的人物，他的價値往往越到後來越被發現；孫先生的偉大精神，也正是這樣一年復一年的積累起來，到逝世十四週紀念的今天，也就是抗戰將近兩年的今天，更使人感到光芒萬丈，照耀宇宙。</p>
<p>我們從下列例證中，可以說明孫中山先生的精神，歷時越久越顯得偉大。第一，孫先生是中國第一個發現民衆力量的人，他大聲疾呼地「喚起民衆」，果然民十五六年間大革命的成功，就由於民衆的協力。不幸以後的十年期間，民衆力量被漠視了起來，直到抗戰砲聲一響，民衆運動才又被積極注意，而最後勝利的基石，也就奠定在民衆一致的力量上面。第二，孫先生指示中國的出路，必須「聯合世界上平等待我之民族共同奮鬥」這一條眞理在十幾年中間一向沒有積極地發揮起來；直到最近的抗戰過程中，中國國民才知道孫先生逝世前所願意結交的國家確是中國第一個眞正的摯友，同時，若干歐美列邦，也受中國抗戰精神的啓示，跟中國緊密的聯繫起來；而中國在得道多助的原則之下，也必須利用友邦的協助來完成抗戰建國的大業。第三，孫先生在民十三初改組國民黨，就容納共產黨人加入共同參加三民主義的國民革命，果然在民十五六間的革命史上放出了異彩；可惜以後十年間兩大政黨由友而敵，以致釀成長時期的內戰，削减了無數可寳貴的國力；直到外患日迫，統一戰綫的呼聲才響徹雲霄，國共兩黨才重新眞誠合作，抗戰建國的偉大工作才得切實地遂行。茲犖犖數端，都是孫先生偉大的啓示，因時間與事實的進展而逐漸被認爲眞理的。然而駕乎上述幾端而上的，孫先生還遺留給中國國民兩件瓌寳；即一，指示中國建國最高原則的三民主義；二，領導中國實際建國工作的一位賢明的領袖。這兩件瓖寳是復興民族建設新中國的眞正核心，中國也祗有依賴這核心的運行，才有越戰越强而走向勝利大道的希望。總之，中國國民今日紀念孫先生，應該超越感情的悲愴，由理智與意志的運用，認識他的不朽的偉大精神，無疑慮地遵奉遺教，並在他遺留給國民的領袖領導之下，共同完成抗戰建國的大業。</p>
<p>今日又爲上海市二期抗戰宣傳週的第一天。抗戰第二期開始到今已經五個月，由事實的昭示，可以確信中國的抗戰現已轉入了有利的階段，無論軍事，政治，建設，文化等各面，都透露着曙光；但爲促使曉色的早早來臨，有使人人了解二期抗戰的特質與普遍發展抗建工作的必要。上海市民今日紀念總理，正不妨就把參加抗戰宣傳週爲具體的表現。不論男女，不分職業，各盡所能，各獻其力，今日以前，或已或未切實參加抗建工作；從今日起，却不可不人人切實地參加。</p>

<p>重慶　國民精神總動員網領、</p>
<p>（一）緒論　抗戰迄今、時逾年半、賴我全國團結之固、將士犧牲之勇、摧挫敵寇之勢燄、消耗敵軍之力量、國譽增高、舉世刮目、然二期抗戰、今已開始、來日方長、所需於吾國民之淬厲奮鬥、以期克服之艱難、較之前期、亦日見其擴大、敵人今日已知軍事力量不足以屈服吾人、而達其解决之目的、故其最近計劃、乃欲以種種方法、搖撼吾人之意志威脅害人之精神、吾人熟察吾國歷史上外患之深、皆因朝野士夫精神上為敵人所懾服、到處不能發揮吾民族雄厚之力量、如宋如明、皆為殷鑑、則今日之所官致力者、尤當注重於精神之振作與集中、質言之、前　抗戰事與精神並重、而第二期即後期之抗戰、則精神允重於軍事、非全國國民堅强、不屈之精神不足以克服艱危而打破敵人精神制勝之毒計、吾人回撫十八閱月以來奮鬥之經過、而檢討其缺失、則物質條件之欠缺、固甚明顯而精神條件之米備、尤難諱言、現代戰爭爲全民動員之戰爭、故不僅應動員國內一切之物質與人力、亦必動員全國國民之精神、欲動員全國國民之精神、以充實抗戰之國力、不僅在於發動而尤貴於組織、必以有組織之精神、發揮有組織之人力、利用有組織之物質、方足以適應國家當前之需要、且此次抗戰之意義、不僅限於排除暴敵之侵略而允在於努力於抗戰之中、樹立戰後建國之永久基礎、其任務之重、使命之大、在我國歷史上將為空間絕後之一役、反觀今日社會、則團結之基礎雖立、而精神之統一未臻、忠勇奮發之表現雖所在多有、而頹廢散漫之狀態亦同時並存、組織懈弛、基礎簿弱、如是之國民精神、何堪負荷國挨興亡之鉅任、鑒往察來、不能不認國民精神總動員之實施、爲今日當務之急也、所謂國民精神總動員者、自其字義言之、則在個人爲集中其一切意識·思維·智慧與精神力量於一個方向而提高使用之、在國民全體爲集中一切年齡·職業·思想·生活各各不同之國民的精神力量於一個目標而共同鼓舞以增進之、整齊調節以發揮之、確定組織之中心、以增强發揮之效率者也、然精神力量之所由表現爲道德、而其所由發揮則必歸着於信仰、古人有言、「成於」、敗於二三、」凡事皆然、况在軍事、况在吾國民處此存亡絕紋爭死生於呼吸之戰之時是以就今日中國而言國民精神總動員、則其涵義應爲集結全國國民之精神於簡單共同之目標、使全國國民對自身皆確立同一的救國道德、對國家堅定同一的建國信仰、而國民每一份子皆能根據同一的道行觀念為同一的信仰而奮鬥犧牲是也、此所陳述、似極平舊、然中華民族之起死回生、必由斯道、吾人如確能舉國一致、實施國民精神總動員、則任何艱鉅、皆可負擔、任何困難、皆可克服、而最後勝利、亦已屬必然、反之、若國民對此不能體會而力行、或體會不眞爭、力行不一致、則國族危機、必將增重、制勝克敵、將益艱難、故抗戰前途、國族命運成敗安危、實均繫於國民精神總動員之一舉、茲特闡共要義、分節論列、願吾國民一致接受而力行之、</p>
<p>（二）共同目標　國民精神總動員有國民人人所易知易行之簡單而明顯之三個共同目標、爲國民精神所當集結者、當首先標揭之、即（一）國家至上、民族至上、（二）軍事第一、勝利第一、與（三）意志集中、力量集中是也、</p>
<p>國家至上民族至上</p>
<p>國家至上、民族至上、吾國民今日無間智愚、應皆已痛切感覺在民族生存受盡威脅之情形下、任何個人與其事業、均末由保其安全、敵人之欲消滅我民族意識、柝散我民族團結、始則臠切而分割、繼必奴辱而澌滅之、其野心毒計、已日益明顯、故鞏固民族生存應先於一切、然民族生活之最高體系為國家、無國家則民族生活不能維持與發展、失國之民族、如猶太人受人宰割、何等悲慘、則鞏固國家、允應先於一切、是以吾人今日必須認定國家至上、民族至上、國家民族之利益、應高於一切、在國家民族之前、應犧牲一切私見·私心·私利·私益·乃至於全家人之目由與生命、亦非所恤、</p>
<p>軍事第一勝利第一</p>
<p>（二）軍事第一、勝利第一、在此解决國族存亡之軍事期中、國家民族之最大利益爲軍事利益、是以國民一切之思想行動、均應絕對受國家民族軍事利益之支配、爲達成軍事之利益、爲增進軍事之利益、國家民族得要求國民爲一切之犧牲、而爲國民自亦必自動踴躍而貢獻一切之所有、故曰軍事第一、軍事之惟一目的、在求得勝利、則國民須確立必勝之信念、達成最後勝利之目的、目竭其全部之知能與全部之時間精力、以求取軍事之勝利、在此時期、應無所謂個人得失、個人利害與個人之屈伸與榮辱、唯求得軍事之勝利、乃爲吾國民人人共享之光榮、唯不能獲得勝利爲人人最大之恥辱、一切功罪、一切是非、胥當以此爲標準、故又曰勝利第一、</p>
<p>意志集中力量集中</p>
<p>（二）意志集中、力量集中、吾國今當國家民族緊急自衛之時、凡爲國民、所有意志、均當集中、所有力量、均當集中、有理智有良心之國民、此時除殫思竭力於如何鞏護國家、求取勝利以外、應無暇有其他思維、亦必不暇有其他行動、而就國家民族以言、則亦必要求國民全體的思想絕對統一集中於國家至上、民族至上、與軍事第一、勝利第一兩義之下、不容其分歧及懐疑、不容作其他之空想空論、更必須動員一切職業、一切部門之國民、均齊心一志、為國家民族軍事利益而奮鬥於艱苦之中各竭其能、各盡其職、以改進一切、創造一切、以貫澈長期的軍事計劃、同時達到吾建國工作之完成、故曰意志集中、力量集中、如上三義、意至簡明、事極易舉、國民對此、必樂於接受、必一致接受、請進而論述吾人所耍求確立之同一道德、併確定同一信仰的內容、</p>
<p>救國道德唯忠與孝</p>
<p>（三）救國之道德中國之需要在振衰起敝、攘寇患以救國家、故今所需於吾國民全體力求實踐之同一道德、厥為救國之道德、亦即總理所倡導之忠孝·仁愛·信義·和平之八德、國民對此八德、認識或有淺深、但中國民族所有之綿延光大、實續有此道德、今之衰弱式微、實由喪此道德、是須要求吾國民一致確立此救國道德、八德之中、最根本者爲忠孝、唯忠與孝乃中華民族立國之大本、五千年來、先民所留遺於後代子孫之至寳、今當國家民族危急之時、全國同胞、務必竭忠盡孝、對國家盡其至忠、對民族行其大孝、</p>
<p>對於民族行其大孝</p>
<p>請先言孝道、中國社會數千年來之所謂孝、不僅盡孝於其親、亦重在盡孝於其祖、故宗祀無後爲最大之不孝、先總理講民族主義、更將中國固有之孝道宣揚光大、而及吾國明親親之義、而推及於同國同族之相關、是以吾人今日行孝之對象、應爲整個之民族、應求不負吾民族共同之祖先、吾人應時刻自念吾數百代共同祖先所辛苦經營而遺留於吾人之錦繡河山、如竟喪失於吾人之手、則吾人上何以對先民、下何以對共同之種姓、他罪猶可贖、不孝無可贖、吾同胞明乎此意、則犧牲自已以維護民族之生存、必引爲人人最高之責任、</p>
<p>對於國家盡其至忠</p>
<p>其决所謂忠者、第一須忠於國家、忠於國家、實即所以保成民族之生存與發展、就中國今日而言、必須人人以擁護國家獨立爲神聖的責任、而後國家乃有救、國家者有其絕對性者也、欲維護國家之自由與獨立、其先决條件則爲軍令政令之絕對統一、今當暴敵以絕大武力推毀我國家、並於各佔領區域製造僞組織、企圖臠割我國家之時、凡我國民、尤必一致忠於國家、以加强國家自衛之力量、忠於職守、忠於紀律、忠於法令、萬不可稍萌渙散或違背法律、以减損國家之威權、吾國人誠能人人對民族盡孝、對國家盡忠、則抗戰救國之使命即有確實負荷之人、至於仁愛信義和平諸德、皆由忠孝二義演進而來、仁愛爲孝道之擴展、信義爲忠道之延長、仁愛則不致相殘、吾人今日能推仁愛之心、則必不坐視同胞之被侮辱被殘殺、而必有同仇敵愾之勇、推信義之心、則必能負責盡職、不欺不貳、以造成一致赴難之團結、推吾數千年愛好和平之固有理想、則必樂於爲抵抗暴力與求取永久和平而奮鬥、且必率先爲勇厲無前之奮鬥、凡此救國道德、當其發揮功用、卽無異於堅甲利兵、質言之、此實民族精神的武器、而國民人人當以之武裝自身、以驅除暴敵、開創吾國家光輝之新歷史者也、</p>
<p>建國原則三民主義</p>
<p>（四）建國之信仰　夫吾人今日所以要求我國民趨集同一之方向、確立同一之道德、不辭艱苦而奮鬥者、其最後目的爲何、曰在完成建設三民主義的國家、前已言之、此次抗戰、意義不僅在却敵、而尙在確立建國之基礎、故雖在戰時、必當一刻不忘建國、蓋唯具有一致確立的建國方針、而以全力推進之、始能充分發揮禦侮之力量、以求取勝利、亦必國民全體的能確立建國之信仰、而後國民之精神力量與救國道德乃有確實之寄託、以爲積極之發揮、故救國與建國、義本一貫、事無二致、中國建國之最高原則、厥爲總理孫先生所手創之三民主義、此固爲全國同胞所公認、今日國家存亡所爭一間、抗戰而勝、則建國必成、民族即得永久之樂利、故吾國民對吾建國原則下之三民主義、須全國共同信仰、共同奮鬥、求其實現、蓋三民主義之目的、在求國際地位平等、政治地位平等、經濟地位平等、吾人當求國家之獨立自由平等、爲民有民治民享、人人心理之所同、而三民主義卽爲達此國家建設唯一無二之法門、今當戰時、人心振奮、趨向更見一致、救國建國、正宜兼程並進、以言之民族主義、則抵抗外侮、以求得民族之獨立自由與平等、固爲今日抗戰唯一之目的、而國內各民族携手、共負抗戰中興、更足以增進整個民族之團結、爲廣大的中華民國奠其堅實之基礎、以言之民權中義、則戰時國民政治智識之普及、旣足以加速培養眞正之民權、而戰時政府職權之集中調整、更足以造成高度效率之政治、以言之民生主義則戰時增加生產、管制消費之努力、即所以建立民生、而國家根據民生主義、以實施戰時經濟政策之結果、必使戰後公私產業、均有平衡合理之發展、而最大多數人民、必以戰時之生活、戰時之行動、戰時之精神、努力生產、努力創造、因以獲得進步與繁榮、循此以進、三民主義的新國家之建立、即在抗戰獲得光榮的勝利之時、而中國永遠安樂之國基、亦將於是始克奠定、前途光明、歷歷在望、此正吾國民所宜應爲體的、一致興奮、共同努力以赴之、而其道則自吾國民一致堅定同一的建國信仰始、（未完）（十一日電）</p>

<p>史丹林報告</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯共產黨第十八屆全國代表大會、昨日舉行第一次會議時、總書記史丹林曾就中央委員會工作情形、提出報告、共中關於外交部份、並無顯著的改觀、今後似亦不致如某某外國人所傳、大事更張、史丹林之言有云「吾人愛好和平、願與各國增進商務關係、祇須各國對我保持同樣關係、並不損害吾國利益、卽可相安無事、各國之與吾國壤土相接者、亦當與之保持善鄰關係、但以各該國不直接間接希圖危害吾國之領土完整、暨邊界之不可侵犯性爲之條件、各國民族之被侵略而爲國家獨立奮鬥者、蘇聯願加以援助、幷不畏懼侵略國之威脅、黷武之國倘有侵犯吾國領土完整、向吾國進攻者、必當加倍予以還擊」、</p>
<p>吾國在經濟政治文化上、均有長足進步、在精神上政治上則已團結一致、吾國海陸軍愈益强大、幷推行和平政策、各國勞工又在精神上予吾國以同情、各國亦其有理解之常識、不以破壞和平而希冀非分之利益、凡此種種、均爲吾國外交政策之後盾、時至此日、帝國主義所鼓動之二次世界大戰業已發動、所志在重行分配世界、德義日三國雖以種種口實、掩飾其眞正意圖、其與英法美三國鬥爭、要屬實在情形、</p>
<p>至是、史丹林幷仿效德義日三國當局之口吻云、「若謂吾人係向英法美三國所保有之利益作戰、實乃滑稽之允、吾人係向共產國際作戰、而非與英法美作戰、世有疑吾言者、曷一審閱反共產國際公的」、（在塲各代表聞言大笑）抑知戰爭乃爲公開之事實、斷非仟何巧語淫辭所得掩盡天下耳目、日本已在中國攫取廣袤土地矣、義國已攫阿比西尼亞矣、德國已攫取奧地利與蘇台德區域矣、德義兩國且已合力攫取西班牙矣、凡此事實、彰明較著、豈軸心云云三角同盟云云所能掩飾、戰爭終屬戰爭、侵略集團終屬侵略集團、如是而已、」</p>
<p>資產階級各國、現有侵略國非侵略之分、非侵略國之讓步不已、由於畏懼革命者少、（革命在戰時必具有世界性質）其主因還在於各非侵略國允其是英法兩國、旣放棄集體安全原則、亦不採行集體抵抗侵略之政策、祇要火未燃眉、即保持中立態度、「西歐各國似以自掃門前雪爲得計、其實錯誤之甚、不特如此、英法兩國且擬轉移德國視綫、令其改向蘇聯烏克蘭邦發展、此種策略、行將招致無可挽救之失畋、詎可不以極端審愼出之、」歐洲各國與美國一部份政客報人、等候德國向烏克蘭邦擴展勢力、已有不耐之勢、竟乃揭穿內幕幷公開聲言、德國中止向蘇聯進展而轉向西歐各國索取殖民地、殊足令人失望云、其所揭櫫之不干涉政策、蓋已揭發無餘矣、」實際言之、凡欲烏克蘭邦脫離蘇聯之輩、可謂不思之甚、捷克喀爾巴阡烏克蘭省居民七十萬人、尙難促其分立、矧蘇聯烏克蘭邦擁有居民三千萬人乎、要而言之、蘇聯所行政策、重在維護和平、幷與各國敦睦鄰誼、但各國亦須採取同樣態度以相處、始爲長治久安之道、蘇聯所有兵力業已加强、他國有來挑釁者、自可泰然處之云（十一日哈瓦斯）</p>

<p>捷京　捷克政府於採行嚴峻方法、撲滅斯洛伐克族中主張分裂派之叛變陰謀後、今夜已控制斯洛伐克自治省之大局、前派往羅馬參加新教皇加冕禮之代表薛伐克、頃已被召回任斯洛伐克總理以代蒂梭、聞蒂梭反對罷免、已向德元首希特勒申訴、希林格衛隊被解散後、其隊員若干已被拘禁、餘者遣往摩拉維亞、斯洛伐克都城之白拉蒂斯拉伐、自今晨稍起騷擾後、現尙寗淸、其鐵路軍站則由軍警防衛、報紙暫行停刋、軍事當局禁止民衆收聽外國廣播無綫電、斯洛伐克與捷克問之衝突歷時已久、何時可獲解决、殊難預言、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>捷京　哈嘉總統下令改組斯洛伐克省自治政府、似屬突然舉動、實則中央政府已在暗中有所佈置、及至自治政府總理兼內長蒂梭受前任宜傳處主任桑諾馬區之慫恿、準備宣布該省爲獨立自由邦時、始毅然出以此種「政變」手段、以先發制人、先是、中央政府深覺該省自治政府當局態度曖味、曾向之提出哀的美頓書、要求鄭重聲明願與捷克族精神團結、詎知自治政府竟拒不照辦、幷乘機提出各項措詞含混之要求、藉以延宕時日、中央政府深知情勢危迫、爰乃决定嚴厲予以裁制、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 盛慕傑</p>
<p>（四）中英借款底運用</p>
<p>此次中英五百萬鎊借款，完全是充任滙兌平準基金，故談及中英借款底運用，無異談及滙兌平準基金底運用。</p>
<p>滙兌平準基金對於統制外滙，頗能因時制宜，中國旣認現行統制外滙辦法未能盡善盡美，則此决滙兌平準基金的運用，當能消除此種缺憾。不過運用過程亦有限制：（一）滙兌變動，如係出於物價水準國際收支等根本事由，其運用的機能比較的狹隘；但如基於滙兌投機。資本逃避等一時不自然的原因，可以發揮極大的機能。（二）在國內金融市塲並無促進膨脹或收縮，而僅在維持安定的情况下，可以發揮無上的機能，但若附帶膨脹或收縮時，運用結果須預爲警戒。不過在可能範圍內仍能適應滙兌變動的情况，和國內經濟之需要，用相當的方式，去發揮它微妙的作用。</p>
<p>目前中國正在實施嚴格的外滙統制和管理貿易，對於國際收支是不難求其平衡，而在國內金融市塲亦僅以維持安定爲原則，則此次借款的運用，自然能發揮極大的機能，當無疑義。幷且滙兌基金的創設，本來發揮於英倫，今中國滙兌平準基金設在倫敦，和英國的滙兌平準基金同樣地運用，將來的成功，自在意中。據每日電聞外交訪員稱，現已作技術上的佈置，依此佈置預計此數——指五百萬鎊，很可以鞏固中國幣制和抵制日本現所施行的破壞方法。運用的結果，蓋可想見。</p>
<p>（五）中英借款與外匯暗市前途</p>
<p>中國財部自去年三月十四日起實施進口外滙統制，以求國際貿易的平衡，和利用外滙出售的限制，節制國內資金底逃避。其後更實施出口外滙統制，促進土貨出口，以收集外幣充實外滙基金。此項政策雖告相當成功，法幣的法定滙價，始終穩固；但是黑市塲的滙率，自三月以後以迄七月爲止，成爲直綫式的下降，自七月以後方始釘住在八便士的水準上。但在人心恐慌的時候，竟有降至六便士的看法，何以在八便士的水準上便穩定下來呢？在日人的觀察說是中國政府和英國滙豐銀行合作維持，在事實上凡是留心外滙新聞的，便可知當暗市緊軟時香港就來電賣出，鬆硬時，就來電買進，滙豐銀行亦採用同樣的步驟，日人的觀察不爲無因。</p>
<p>中國現在旣借款五百萬鎊成立一千萬鎊的滙兌平準基金，對於暗市自屬一種極大的威脅，試看下列的行市：</p>
<p>不過暗市可能的放長，以至於和法定價相等，還是有問題的。日人搜羅法幣以套取外匯，和上海的貿易仍是入超，及其他種種環境上的限制，還是使得暗市仍有存在的餘地，因爲這種種都是使暗市存在的因素，觀於自去年七月以來暗市始終釘住八便士的水準便可證明。所以外滙暗市的前途，便是滙率决不會再下降，而有放長的趨勢，但决不會放到和法定價相等。近來市面天津帮紗花帮大量吐出，而滙豐銀行大量吸進，這種情形，同樣可以證明。路透社九日電傳宋子良談話：中國於去年間所取之貨幣步驟，經騐上已表示無誤，九江廣州和漢口底相繼陷落，雖引起投機舉動，但外滙市塲仍經堅定維持，中國銀行甚至能將在任何嚴重的軍事失利時用以援助法幣底外滙，在匯市安靜中全數購回。此言細加分析，不難了解中英滙兌基金借款對於外滙暗市的關係和影響呢！</p>
<p>然則中英滙兌基金借款能吾消滅暗市滙率呢？那末，暗市匯率的敵人是時間因素，中國一天一天接近最後勝利，滙兌平準基金便一天一天發揮它的機能，暗市匯率便一天一天放長到法定價。</p>
<p>（六）中英與「日偽」這經濟戰</p>
<p>中英借款此次成立，適在日僞定三月十日禁止華北的中國法幣底流通和施行外滙統制之前，及中國正在重慶舉行地方金融會議集中討論如何收購重要物資原料以免爲「日僞」利用，如何利用省鈔發行深入游擊區內行使藉以抵制「日僞」紙幣的流通等問題之時。很顯然的是一種對於日本企圖在華北减貶法幣價値和排斥外人利益底經濟報復行爲，及中國運用此項借款在國內的佈置。故將此决借款事和金融會議綜合起來去與「日僞」三月十日在華北的舉措對照而觀，便知是中英與「日僞」間的一種經濟戰爭了。因爲中國耍維持在戰時貨幣金融底穩固，英國耍維持中國的利益，不受日本取締和侵害，祗有聯合起來，以共同的經濟行爲去對抗「日僞」，以擊破它底野心的企圖。而中英聯合設立滙兌平準基金，即是此種共同經濟行爲中的一種。（完）</p>

<p>悼念總理更應堅决抗戰</p>
<p>全市親愛的同胞們、今天是中國國民黨總理·中華民國國父·世界革命導師孫中山先生逝世第十四週年的紀念日、我們追憶十四年前之今日、總理垂危時、殷殷囑咐我們「不要爲敵人所軟化」的遺訓、「和平奮鬭救中國」的遺教、瞻顧當前我國的錦繡河山、爲敵人的鐵蹄蹂躪殆遍、數千萬將士同胞、以熱血頭顱、爲民族的、永久生存·國際的和平正義·而艱苦奮鬭、眞感到無限的悲憤、無窮的興奮、我們深信全市同胞在今天沉痛悼念總理逝世的情緒之中、一定更堅决更一致地號召中華民族的兒女、黃帝的子孫、唯有堅决抗戰到底、才能爭取我國的最後勝利、才對得起總理在天之靈、</p>
<p>不要為敵人軟化的遺訓</p>
<p>總理革命四十年、根據他一生奮鬥的經騐、深知敵人之暴力不足畏、環境之險惡不足畏、人力財力物力之不如人、亦不足畏、惟有自己的精神爲敵人所軟化、所脅制才足畏、辛亥革命前、同盟會的實力能有幾何、然而、總理憑着少數堅貞不移的同志、屢仆屢起、百折不撓、武昌起義一役、卒推翻了滿淸二百六十餘年的統治局面、掃蕩了三千餘年來的專制政體、這不是革命黨的人力財力物力勝過滿淸政府、而是總理及其信徒之革命精神、凌駕一切、超越一切、滿淸政府自然爲之土崩瓦解、討袁護法諸役的成功、也都是革命精神克敵制勝的具體結果、總理垂危之時、追溯過去、俯念將來、最不能放懷的就是中華民國的國民、中國國民黨的黨員、能不能深切體會這革命運動中唯一法寳、「不要爲敵人所軟化」的遺訓、是何等的沉痛、深刻而遠大啊、</p>
<p>最高領袖克承遺訓邁進</p>
<p>我最高蔣委員長、於十四年前總理逝世北平之時、正提師掃蕩兩粵叛逆之日、在節節勝利的時候、驀然得到了革命　師遽告離世的消息、悲憤塡膺之餘、深信欲完成總理革命之大業、惟有深切體會總理的遺訓、民國十五年、國民革命軍誓師北伐之時、廣州國民政府之人力財力物力不如軍閥政府遠甚、然而、蔣委員長克敵制勝、完成統一的武器是什麼、便是這百折不撓艱苦卓絕的革命精神、這偉大的革命精神、是「不要爲敵人所軟化」的遺訓所鑄成的、秉持了總理這偉大的遺訓、卒所向無敵、克底於成、</p>
<p>粉碎敵脅制我精神陰謀</p>
<p>此次日本帝國主義瘋狂地發動着侵略戰爭、欲實現其滅亡中國征服世界的野心、我蔣委昌長領導全國民衆、奮起抗戰、在過去二十偭月中、不獨粉碎了敵人「速戰速决」的迷夢、並且擊破了敵人「速和速結」的陰謀、敵人之武力·財力·物力、均勝於我、何以我們能使敵人陷入泥淖而牢不可拔呢、這種以弱克强、反敗爲勝的原因、就是由於蔣委員長以總理的革命精神、貫輸於全國兵心民心、以全國鋼鐵般的意志、烈燄般的精神、與敵週旋、强暴的敵人、自然陷於覆敗之境、時至今日、敵寇之戰略政略、均告失敗、我國之最後勝利、日見迫近日本帝國主義在此進退失據之時、其唯一掙扎的辦法、便是企圖軟化我抗戰的精神、脅制我革命建國內意志、所謂「建設東亞新秩序」、「東亞協同體」、「日滿支不可分」、等荒謬的名詞、便是意圖毒化我精神的具體表現、於此我們更可見總理識見之高遠偉大、可垂百世、而敵宼則心勞日拙、黔驢技窮、</p>
<p>發揚我總理的革命精神</p>
<p>所以我們今天以無限情緒、來紀念總理之逝世、更應該發揚總理不軟化·不妥協·不屈服·的革命精神、與暴敵奮鬥到底、敵寇一日不退出中國領土、抗戰即一日不可休止、我上海自淪陷爲孤島後、全市同胞的革命精神、更發揚蹈厲、熱愛祖國的革命情緒、更日見增高、我們爲使農工商學靑年婦女各界同胞、更能深切理解、總理的不妥協不屈服的革命精神、以及粉碎敵寇欲軟化脅制我精神的陰謀毒計起見、於今日總理逝世紀念日起、至十八日止、特舉行第二期抗戰第一次宜傳週、望我各界同胞、深切瞭解敵之必敗、我之必勝、更加强抗敵後援之工作、為全國民衆之表率、如此方不愧爲總理之信徒、方可完成總理「和平奮鬥救中國」的未竟大業、中國國民黨上海特別市執行委員會、</p>
<h3 id="c74">第二期抗戰宣傳週　今日商界宣傳日　各商業團體告商界同胞書以推銷國貨開發內地相勉 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>上海各商業團體告商界同胞書云、全市商界同胞們、今天是上海第二期抗戰第一次宣傳週的商界宣傳日、上海自國軍西撤以後、全市商界同胞、不僅站在自己的崗位上、努力推銷國貨的工作、並且對於獻金政府救濟難胞等運動、亦率先提倡、不遺餘力、這一點、我們稍可告慰於全國同胞的、不過在這後期抗戰業已開始之今日、一方面固然是我國的最後勝利、愈見迫切、同時其任務之艱鉅偉大、亦遠勝於前期、有待於全國同胞之更加强奮鬥、戮力邁進者、亦不待煩言而解、上海雖告淪陷、但上海商界在全中國之地位、全世界的觀瞻上、仍不失爲一個非常重要的部份、我上海商界應盡之責任、自彌見重大、茲列舉二事、願全市商界同胞共勉之、</p>
<p>第一、我們應該更加强國貨的推銷工作、現代的戰爭、是國力與國力對比的戰爭、而經濟佔國力中最重要的地位、敵人發動侵略戰爭到現在、其財政經濟之枯竭困迫、盡人皆知、在目前唯一苟延殘喘的辦法、便是一方面企圗就地籌餉、用暴力剝削我民衆、一方面以粗製濫造改頭換面的商品、向我國傾銷、意圖獨霸我市塲、上海便是敵貨傾銷的大本營、關於前者、敵人受我廣大游擊戰爭的展開、已到處碰壁、不克實現其陰謀、關於後者、敵人方傾其全力於此、擅自减低關稅、獨霸長江航運、不獨排斥我國國貨、對於歐美各國商品、亦欲予以致命的打擊、我商界同胞處斯危機、應格外警惕環境之陰惡、更加强我們推銷國貨的工作、我全市同胞之樂用國貨、自不成問題、其關鍵在乎商界如何使同胞明辨國貨與仇貨之區別、倘使我們能把國貨廣爲宣傳推銷、那麼敵人的傾銷政策、勢必因我同胞之拒絕購買、而無所施其伎倆了、</p>
<p>第二、全市實業界金融界應努力開發西北和西南的富源、我國富源遍地、西南西北、蘊藏尤豐、過去實業界和金融界、往往把資金集中於都市、而不從遠處大處着眼、現在長期抗戰之國策、旣爲全國民衆所信仰擁護、那麼、開發西北和西甫的工作、便是我們實業界·和金融界·實責無旁貸、深望全市金融界和實業界之領袖、率先倡導、踴躍投資、政府民衆、必予以至善的助力、</p>
<p>上述兩點、爲今後商界應特別努力的方向、亦爲抗戰建國運動中商界應有之努力、最後敬祝全市商界同胞努力成功、上海各商業團體聯合會、</p>
<p>附商界宣傳日努力綱領</p>
<p>（一）注意國貨劣貨之辨別、（二）努力推銷眞正國貨、（三）與敵人漢奸斷絕一切往來、（四）不用敵僞貨幣、（五）不運輸敵貨、（六）不販賣敵貨、（七）不供給敵人工廠原料、（八）開闢西南西北富源、充實抗戰基礎、（九）節約的獻金、充實外匯基金、（十）完納所得稅印花稅於中央政府、（十）（一）勞資合作、努力國貨生產、（十）（二）健全同業組織、相互輔助監督、</p>
<h3 id="c75">米市暗盤飛漲　顯然有人操縱　行客雙方乘機壟斷足以妨害正常交易租界米店限價平糶 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>連日本市米價、表面雖趨平穩、而實際方面、行與客之暗盤交易、已突然超出限價之外、市塲情形、又呈混亂、各客帮曾要求寬放至十五元限價、豆米行業公會、定明日開臨時會議討論、租界當局、認米市飛漲、顯然有人操縱、業已派員嚴密監視、將予懲處、以維民食、至於訂購洋米之建議、經富局研究結果、因海外價格、連同運費等、較國米市價高昂、事實上不能訂購、米號業公會整飭界內各米店、一律照限價平糶、茲經現代社記者、探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>市價混亂</p>
<p>關於本市米價、茲因內地來源缺乏、市塲所交易之棧貨、囤戶方面、乘機套買、以致連日飛漲、溢出限價之外、幸經豆米行業公會議决、仍維十四元之袋高限價、並由市塲管理委員會、勸告同業各行客平價脫售、嚴厲執行公會議决辦法後、行市稍趨平穩、客商亦繼續販運、情形已呈好轉之時、忽於三月十日起、市塲交易、又劇烈變動、表面上雖仍維持十四元之限價、但實際行與客之間、所成交之米糧、大放暗盤、市價近乎十五元、昨日（三月十一日）市塲開市後、市價又復扶搖直上、最高白粳、暗盤竟冉高漲至十五元關外、雖市塲竭力鎮壓亦無法抑止、交易情况、空前混沌、故市塲於上午十一時、即行收市、</p>
<p>要求寬放</p>
<p>據現代社記者探悉、米業市塲各帮入市交易客商、以內地產區、米價高漲、幾與滬地限價相埒、此外再加運費捐稅等、則無利可沾、故要求寬放限價每石十五元、本市豆米行同業公會、特定於明日（三月十三日）下午三時、在雜糧交易所二樓、召集臨時執監聯席會議、將此項要求、提付討論、據同業方面意見、如寬放限價問題、即經公會議决可行、亦須徵得工部局之同意、方可實行、</p>
<p>當局監視</p>
<p>公共租界工部局、及法租界公董局、對滬市米價、甚爲關切、對界內四百餘萬人口之民食調節仍本其原定計劃、兩當局合作維持、最近滬市塲米價突然飛漲、影響平民生計至鉅、除派員蒞塲監視交易外、凡經查有行客雙方乘機操縱壟斷、足以妨害正常交易之行爲者、决從嚴取締、並予懲處、同業公會方面、亦嚴防行客抬價擾亂行市、如經查出者亦公議處罰、以資警惕、而懲來茲、</p>
<p>洋米價昂</p>
<p>本市米業同業公會、因所屬會員米店、均係直接售於食戶、關係密切、故該會除前經議决維持限價外、將再訂零售市價、白米·秈米·白秈·每石十四元、二等米每石十三元四角、整飭同業、一體遵照、評定市價、辦理平糶、以維民食、</p>
<p>洋米價昂</p>
<p>據米業界負責人語現代社記者云、目前滬市存米、實數計有七八十萬包、合市斛計算、尙有一百二三十萬石、定可維持滬市三個月之民食而有餘、內地產區、存底雖缺、惟每日運滬者、不論其多少、尙能補貼、故民食暫時决無恐慌之虞、至於豆米行業公會、爲末雨綢繆計、在報告兩租界當局之函件中曾建議當局、預籌妥善辦法、或訂購洋米、或疏通來源等、但據最近國外市塲消息、去年暹羅西貢等產米略少、市價較漲、如訂購洋米運滬接濟、殊不合算、照目前滬市存米而論、暫時無訂購洋米之必要、</p>
<h3 id="c76">日方傳總攻浦東　華軍嚴防　設日軍無此企圖華軍亦必先發動 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>浦東區內、因在日軍部內工作之漢奸、對外亂放空氣、謂日軍又將有所行動、進犯游擊隊控制區域、以消除威脅、但一般觀察、日軍兵力單薄、游擊隊實力雄厚、此項企圗、絕難得逞、茲將各情、分紀如次、</p>
<p>進犯不逞　去歲春間、日方曾乘杭州退兵之機會、沿滬杭公路北犯奉南川三縣、當時挾有一萬兵力、希圖將三縣游擊隊一鼓解决、詎華方行動飄忽、絕未損及毫末、故未旬日間、大部日軍外調後、少數日軍、仍退守沿浦間據點、游擊隊依然控制其原有區域、去冬日軍又圖三路進犯、且會深入南滙海濱之泥城、及舊奉賢城、結果因三縣腹地河沼縱橫、橋樑一斷、均爲絕路、故各路日軍、仍爲游擊隊完全擊退、</p>
<p>利誘不遂　日方且因一再施行軍事、喪兵折將、勞師無功、故威脅不遂、改以利誘、迭次以優厚條件、游說華軍、停止敵對狀態、以免後顧之憂、但無恥說客、屢被華方以漢奸罪名、加以正法、去歲如任鵬飛之流、均爲此喪生、故「銀彈」政策、全爲華軍擊破、</p>
<p>傳將行動　連日漢奸透露消息、傳日陸軍上海警備部隊司令官櫻井、召集川沙警備隊長植弘、南滙警備隊長小川、奉賢警備隊長中島、秘密會議、擬於無辦中、强行抽調近郊兵力、依據現在川沙之縣城、南滙之周浦、及奉賢三據點、再行深入三縣腹地、進攻華軍、以圖消除威脅、擴大僞組織地盤、且傳於天氣放晴之後、開始行動、屆時並必封鎖浦東西水面交通、致日軍區域內、人心浮動、計劃暫行搬遷者甚衆、</p>
<p>華軍準備　在三縣華軍方面、均已接到此項情報、姑不論漢奸所傳、是吾亂放空氣、或日方有此企圖、業已在種種配備上、動作上、聯絡上、均作必要之準備、日如冒險進犯、必予重大打擊、且東戰塲華軍、對整個東戰塲、戰局、華軍方面、頗有裨益、設日軍無此企圖、華軍亦必主動向日本攻擊、實行牽制戰與消耗戰、故浦東大戰、勢必難免、</p>

<p>大陸報云、關於日方消息所傳工部局與上海日當局商妥在公共租界內取預防恐怖份子之辦法事、記者昨（十日）晚向工部局方面叩詢、局方對日文報紙所載、日本憲兵不獨將設辦事處於工部局之捕房、且其所有分捕房中、均將設立、」之說、加以否認、據</p>
<p>局方發表　之消息稱、恊定係於本月三日商定、警務處之警權與完整、仍予維持、但恊定全文、並未發表、協定商妥日之晚、日方半官機關同盟社、即發電日本、對於和解條的之解釋、稍有不同、日本之英日文各報、大多均載是項報告、本埠今已接得此種報紙、故同盟社之消息、已引起</p>

<p>設特別部　討論便利日方與局方當局合作之方法、該部主任、將由日人任之、（五）鑒於局方所僱華捕、力不足以控制控怖份子、故日人將取適當辦法、指導華捕、（六）日警方面、將照新聞電影　鞫訊日警與局方巡捕所逮獲罪犯與嫌疑犯、記者將日文報紙消息所含各點、叩詢局方、據答、此說全部不確、但彼等未加其他評論、</p>

<p>自侵華戰事發動、江浙兩省、痛告淪陷後、各區蠶桑、慘遭蹂躪、日軍並强將桑種拔去、損害之重、尙難統計、旋日方爲陰謀掠奪中國蠶絲事業、經派熟悉我國情形之木容·久保田昌·人佐瀨旭·等、分批至江浙　地產蠶區域、實施調查、並前三井洋行職員鈴木格三郎、勾結漢奸張子振等、於去年夏間、在無鍚組織「惠明公司」、將原有之禾豐·振義·安餘·福綸·振元·等各絲廠合併、共計絲車二千餘部、資本定爲五千萬、由日人星忠勇任經理、漢好張子振任協理、其原料來源、均向各區人民、强行刦奪、或以低價勒迫收買、所有蠶繭、亦悉遭搜括、以是該公司至去年底止、爲時僅數月、竟獲利達二百餘萬元之鉅、實則均係蠶農之膏血</p>
<p>華中公司陰謀統制</p>
<p>該一惠明公司」於去年八月後復改組為「華中蠶絲公司」、並加緊侵略陰謀、希圖實施統制華中絲業、擬定各項計劃、對蠶種桑塲等、均施管理本年一月份起、該僞「華中公司」曾向各種塲、提出下列條件、（一）公司對每塲得派日人經理一人、常川駐塲、管理一切、薪水由種塲負担、（二）蠶種由公司分派不得複製和分讓、（三）蠶種由公司收買、（四）種款於製畢時、先付一半、餘視蠶收情形如何、或全付或折付、（五）該章程公司有隨時修改之權、以上辦法、曾由日方迭次召集各製種塲開會、但因一般塲主、深明大義、激於愛國義憤、不願受其宰割、故均拒不參加、故日方此項陰謀、尙未獲全部實施、</p>
<p>內地僅存小型絲廠</p>
<p>江浙兩省絲產、在日方暴力重重壓迫下、原有開設杭·嘉·湖·錫·常等地規模較大之絲廠、悉遭刦持、但日方對用車十部或二十部之小絲廠、則並不重視、故一般蠶絲業人員暨農戶、遂凑集小額資本、購辦絲車若干部、即在各鄕間設立小型絲廠、因繭價低廉、尙能稍獲利潤、其中資力較充者、則遷至滬市租界設廠開工、據現代社記者調查所得、本市絲廠、計有怡和絲廠·上海絲廠·同仁絲廠·等三十七家、絲軍共六千餘部、現海外華絲市價、每担達一千二三百元、故各廠營業尙佳云、自「華中公司」設立後、今後原料、頗將引成問題、</p>

<h3 id="c82">千萬鎊借款成功後　法幣準備益見鞏固　四行發行現金準備改存英美决以全力穩定外匯維持債信 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>我國法幣政策成功之後、政府爲充實法幣準備、穩定滙兌起見、向匯豐·麥加利·中國·交通·四行成立一千萬英鎊借款、發行現金準備金貯藏於英美、發行政策、依然鄭重、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>戰後法幣發行鄭重</p>
<p>法幣政策在戰前已見成功、經戰事而其信用益著、法幣現金準備、始終在百分之六十以上、而保證準備、則在百分之四十以下、歷决檢查、均與法定比例相合、發行總額二十六年終爲一·六三九·〇九八·〇〇〇元、二十七年六月增至一·七二六·九九八·〇〇〇元、其增加率已不若改革初期之速、蓋目二十四年十二月至二十五年十二月、發行共增五六八·九七九·〇〇元、自二十五年十二月至二十六年十二月、發行共增三七九·一三六·〇〇〇元、於是足證在戰期中法幣發行之謹愼、亦即政府未嘗乞靈於紙幣政策之證明、</p>
<p>防止法幣流入陷區</p>
<p>財政部為防止法幣鉅量流入淪陷區域、規定由內地滙至上海之款一律以匯劃票據付給之、由滬以滙劃票據匯至內地之款、均以法幣十足付給之、並限制携帶法幣至上海辦法、凡經過各關開往上海之輪船、以五百元爲限、其餘數目應妥具保證、俟到達上海、即全數移存上海中央銀行、作爲活期存款、國內公債之還本付息、改由重慶十足付款、上海即分六期償付之、旨在防止法幣鉅量流入上海、於是日僞企圖以「僞票」「聯券」掉換法幣、套取外匯計劃完全失敗、</p>
<p>現金準備改存英美</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行探悉、中中交農四行法幣發行之現金準備、向由發行準備管理委員會保管、貯藏於國內各大銀行庫房內、戰後政府已先後將現金準備、如白銀黃金等、運至英美兩國、或委託代爲保管、或換取外匯存於國外、今爲充實法幣準備起見、向英商滙豐·麥加利·中國·交通·等四行、成立一千萬英鎊借款、是項欵子、均存於英之倫敦、並組織資金運用委員會、故此後之法幣現金準備、將更趨鞏固、政府將以其全力穩定外匯、維持僓信、</p>
<p>金融前途益覺安定</p>
<p>戰後之全國金融、經肘政部竭力穩定後、資金流入都市、更以有公私金融機關之調劑、故資金轉見充裕、各地先後說立中·中·交·農·四行聯合辦事處、及貼放委員會、於是全國金融、依然穩定如恒、自最近英·美·信用借款成功後、我國之國際收支、更趨順勢、故金融前途、益覺安定、各銀行鑒於自身準備充足、紛向西南、西北·各地增設分支行或辦事處、協助政府開發、和建設內地、並將金融重心、移至內地、因此內地之資金、轉見充裕、其有助於生產之發展者、良非淺鮮、</p>

<h3 id="c120">難童的敎養問題 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>隨着這次抗戰而來的無數小難胞，他們的家已給侵略者的砲火轟燬，他們都變成了無工可作，無書可讀的難童。有的寄居在收容所中，有的流浪在街頭巷尾，行乞度日。</p>
<p>誰不承認見童是一國的未來主人翁，國家社會自有敎養他們的責任。而這般難童，又怎可拋棄在敎養圈外呢？尤其在此抗戰建國的時代，他們都是國家的命脈，未來的戰士，關係於民族甚巨，更不容我們漠視了。</p>
<p>所以在目前各收容所中都有難童學校的設立，中華兒童敎育社復有街童敎育的提倡，並創設了不少的街童學校。上海國際救濟會在厦門路設立街頭兒童職業敎養院。上海救濟難民兒童敎養院籌募基金，建築院舍，儘量收容難童。上海兒童保育會除了創辦報童學校外，又積極籌設丐童敎養院，不久卽將成立。至於難童的敎養，一方面當然先要維持他們的生活，但另一方面尤須注意到敎育的問題。這樣敎養並顧，不但使他們目前的生活能够維持，而且授以生活上必需的知識技能，陶冶其民族的意識，培養共自立的精神和能力，使將來能成爲社會的有用分子，好替國家出力一番。</p>
<p>所以敎育難童，特別需要注意以下的幾個原則：</p>
<p>一，培養民族的意識　使他們對於當前民族危機有深切認識，並積極地養成他們團結一致，愛護祖國，保衛民族的生存。</p>
<p>二，培養自立的精神　收容所，敎養所决不是養老院一般葬送他們一生的。應該革除他們的依賴性，培養其獨立創造的精神，有爲社會服務的决心。</p>
<p>三，培養科學的頭腦　授以生活上所必需的知識，用這些知識來分析，來明瞭，來解决生活上的種種問題。</p>
<p>四，培養生產的能力　在勞動上，指導他們生產的技能，養成勞工的身手，給他們以未來的自立的出路。</p>
<p>五，培養衛生的習慣　難童十九是骯髒的，對於衛生習慣的養成，尤其重要。必須於日常的生活上，隨時指導。</p>

<p>—爲紀念二十八年「總理逝世紀念」而作</p>
<p>鐺！鐺！鐺！的鐘聲響了，各級小朋友排好隊依次進了禮堂，在禮堂的門上，那天特地紮上了一座「天下爲公」的柏枝牌樓，在講臺上放着幾個花圈，顯出一種莊嚴肅穆的氣象。</p>
<p>行禮如儀後，主席李校長用着悲壯的聲調，報告中山先生逝世的經過，全堂靜寂得一些聲音也沒有。他說：「今天是三月十二日，是中山先生的逝世紀念日，中山先生自從倡導革命以後，眞是沒有一刻時候，不在想革命的念頭，做革命的工作，民國成立後，許多軍閥專橫，中山先牛仍是不斷地奮鬥，用了許多方法，要想把軍閥打倒，實現和平統一。</p>
<p>到民國十三年的九月，北方軍閥正是混戰得起勁的時候，中山先生認爲打倒軍閥的機會來了，自己便率領軍隊北伐，後來吳佩孚部下的將官倒戈，軍閥瓦解，於是中山先生單身到北方去，進行和平統一的工作，他主張開一個國民會議，集合各團體代表，解决國家的事情，到處演說，使民衆明白他的主張，可是精神上太勞苦了，到了天津，就發現那積勞而成的肝癌病，經不少的名醫診治，總是不見效騐，先生却還是負病到北京去，進協和醫院，用鐳錠治療，也沒有功効，到三月十一日早晨，忽然腦筋變得很淸楚，召夫人宋慶齡，公子孫科及在精衛等到病榻前，說明他所抱的主張沒有實現，希望諸同志努力，又命把在上月二十四日預備好的遺囑呈上，親手用鋼筆簽字，突然呼用「和平」！「奮鬥」！「救中國」！一聲，後一聲的莫有四十多聲，延到十二日上午十時半逝世，享年六十歲，這個不幸的消息傳出後，震動了全中國全世界入們的心絃，各地多舉行盛大的追悼會，當在北牛出殯的那一天，送的有十萬人，可見中山先生人格的偉大和感人的深刻了。孫先生逝世後，他的靈櫬暫時放在北平西山碧雲寺，到十八年移靈南下，奉安於南京紫金山陵墓，供後人瞻謁。」</p>
<p>李校長報告完畢，接着陳老師也演說：「小朋友們！總理臨終時，喊和平奮鬥救中國的口號，吾們看看現在的中國是怎樣的一個局面，吾們的政府正爲着民族的自由在那裏艱苦的奮鬥，處在孤島上的小朋友們在今天紀念總理的時侯，應該抱如何一個决心來謀得國家的眞正「和平」呢？</p>

<p>— 昌</p>
<p>小朋友們：你們知道嗎，滾水或冰琪淋，放在熱水瓶裹，爲什麼都能保持其溫度不變呢？假如是玻璃瓶，那末結果不是完全不同了嗎？因爲熱的傳佈總不外：（一）對流（二）傳導（三）輻射，要是能使這三件都能避免，則溫度自然不會變更了；今分三部略述之：</p>
<p>（一）對流—熱的流體向上升，冷的下降，這樣由熱體或流體受熱部份從一處傳到他處呌對流；熱水瓶內都爲同溫度根本沒有對流的導熱作用，故不變</p>
<p>（二）傳導—傳導的作用是必須藉中間物的，或固體，或氣體，熱水瓶的沒有固體中問物，事情很明顯，可不必說，關於氣體的，稍加補充，熱水瓶的玻璃是兩層的，中間抽爲眞空，假如熱氣通過了玻璃層，則决不能通過眞空而逃去的，所以熱水瓶的能保持溫度，此其一也。</p>
<p>（三）幅射—許多科學家都假設了一種沒有重量而有彈性的束西瀰漫在空間，呌做以太（Ether）光或熱賴了以太而傳播的就呌輻射；輻射熱能透過眞空，因眞空中有以太，那末爲什麼熱水瓶熱度會不變呢？因輻射被淡色，光亮的白色物體所吸收最少，而熱水瓶的玻璃層都鍍有極亮的水銀，所以輻射又不易逸出。你祗要看，雪在日光中熔化是很慢的，假如覆以黑烟或黑灰，則速度就增快了，這就證明了物質吸收輻射熱對色亮有極大關係的。</p>
<p>上面簡單的解釋了，小朋友，你們明瞭了嗎？</p>

<p>—明兒避記之十五—</p>
<p>明兒們在那深夜中上了船，他們都已十二分的疲乏了。到了船中，那些胆小的人，心兒還有些跳動着，明兒也有這樣的情景。那隻船是比較寬大了，更有四個船舖，張李兩家的人數比較小一些，各佔了一個，明兒家佔了兩鋪。明兒的母親更呌船夫把自己不需要的行李放到船艙裏，日用的放在手邊，於是道樣的又忙了一陣。</p>
<p>明兒家雖有兩鋪，還不够支配，明兒和他的父兄只得睡在船板上，張李兩先生讓他們的夫人睡在鋪上，而自已和他們的兒子也擠到船板上來睡，因此十多個人睡在這麼一方小小的船板上，當然是睡不下的，幸虧張先生想出了一個妙法，各人把自己的脚挿在對面兩人身體間，這樣睡的問題可以解决了。「這是交通壕」張先生笑喀喀的對明兒說，更接着向他父親道：「我們的被頭要不要成交通壕，這樣比較舒適一些，不過脚上的異味，各不負責。」這幾句話，說得他們笑起來。明兒覺得這樣像罐頭沙田魚式的睡覺。比較在前兩天的小船上是舒服得多，倒底可以伸平了頭和脚，因此不到一刻鐘，明兒已呼呼的睡熟了。</p>
<p>明兒正睡得甜，好像耳朶中聽得誰在說：「錢塘江大鐵橋……他忽的彎着身子起來帶着疲倦的眼向船艙外望去。那時天剛亮，錢塘江上迷濛的一片白霧，好像一白紗籠罩在江面上，這時明兒身上漸漸覺得有些寒意。他從重重的霧中望見一座隱隱的大鐵橋。父親在旁讚美着：「這浩大的工程，在中國的是罕有的。明兒，我很希望你將來能建造這樣偉大工程的工程師」。明兒的心中亦是很欽佩那建造錢塘大橋的工程師，也很希望自己亦有這樣的偉大的貢獻，不過却不敢說出來了。他們的船漸漸的進入橋洞了，這時船裹的光綫比以前暗淡了，好似在山洞裏一般。經過了差不多二分鐘，船裏漸漸的明亮了，船更向前晃動着，和杭州一步步的遠了。那橋影由淸晰而糢糊，明兒的心中頓時起了一陣酸，因爲妝是久慕了杭州的大而現在竟有這樣好的機會可錯過了，因此他在暗暗的默禱：「願錢塘大橋永存，更望我們能重回杭州」。沒有一刻，橋影失踪了。</p>
<p>那船很平穩的駛去，船裏的人很是忙碌，因爲他們剛起身，三十多個人要幹起身後的工作，熱水，毛巾，牙刷，忙個不了。明兒拿了面盆，在河裏打了一些水，在船頭上洗臉，呼吸些新鮮的空氣，父親也走出來看看這美麗的風景，他把手指着那塔說：「明兒你瞧，那就是杭州的六和塔，再望過去一些，那在山上一帶的屋子，便是之江大學，你總聽見過的一。明兒便接着說：是的，那學校的環境是美麗極了，這樣的讀書還怕沒有進步嗎？爸爸，我希望將來到那學校去一。父親說：一到將來再說罷。」</p>
<p>杭州的六和塔也不見了，明兒暗暗的念着：「再會罷！杭州，祝你永永無恙」。</p>

<p>— 知恂</p>
<p>夢想也會有家，小朋友們看了這標題也許要責問我；『我們從來沒有聽見過有夢想家這名詞的，只有科學家，敎育家……』但是我請小朋友們別心急，且聽我道來。愛迪生孵蛋的故事，這原是他過後成功科學家的夢想。</p>
<p>無綫電的成功，是馬可尼的夢想的結果。</p>
<p>我們現在使用電報的便利，誰能吾認不是摩十的夢想的世界交通工具的革命的成功，如果沒有斯蒂芬遜在做礦工的時候，就夢想着發明汽機車，難道會有今日之進步麼？</p>
<p>海底電訊的實現，要是沒有飛兩特的夢想，竟會有將渡過大西洋的兩大洲聯繫在一起的可能哪！</p>
<p>如此的例子，實在是舉不勝舉。</p>
<p>不用說，人類從卑賤中釋放出來，從壓迫中爭取自由，求得人生的舒適幸福，我們都得感謝我們的夢想的！</p>
<p>對啦，現在的一切的成功，都是過去一切夢想的總和———就是過去的一切夢想實現的結果　沒有夢想，人類永遠不會有進步。</p>
<p>但是，夢想也不能超脫其他能力一樣的好和歹的範疇。假如有人把夢想的能力誤用或是濫用了，他們把全部的生命力，費在他們不能實現的空中樓閣上。這是無可諱言的，這種夢想的表演，祇是像瘋狗一般的到處亂咬；這種夢想的結果，祇是能力消沉，因不能活動而崩潰爲止。如果要舉出這種夢想者的例子來，我想小朋友們一定也能够猜測着的，這眞像是我們强鄰的縮寫。</p>
<p>我們不要阻止夢想，而且要發揚夢想，我們要努力地使其實現！反之，我們即使把夢想移用在戰爭上，我們當然要使我們爲自由，和平，爲民族的復興，世界安全的夢想而促其成功。而且我們這個大我夢想的實現，就在限前了。</p>
<p>小朋友，你想做一個夢想家嗎？</p>

<p>— 陳山</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>問：自來水筆何以能將墨水自行吸入？</p>
<p>答：自來水筆裏面有橡皮管，當我們將管子壓癟時，管內空氣，就被擠出，放手時，橡皮管恢復原狀，墨水瓶內的　水，因爲管內壓力的稀薄，就被大氣壓力，壓入管內。所以自來水筆，能將墨水自行吸入。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>問：演馬戲的人，在馬上翻筋斗，落下來仍在馬上，是什麼緣故？</p>
<p>答：演馬戲的人，在馬上翻筋斗，落下來仍在馬上，這是由於惰性的緣故。因爲人是坐在馬上，隨着馬走的。當他翻筋斗的時候，身體乃因惰性繼續進行不已，他前進的速率，和馬行的速度，始終一樣（空氣阻力不計入）所以仍能落到馬上去。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>問：如嫌茶熱，只要就杯口吹氣，不久耶凉，或用兩杯將茶移來移去亦可，是什麼緣故？</p>
<p>答：就杯口吹氣，或用兩杯將茶移來移去，都能促進水的蒸發，蒸發是吸熱的，所以能够使茶變凉。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>問：說明眼鏡的種類和作用？</p>
<p>答：眼鏡有三種，就是近視眼鏡（用凹透鏡製）遠視眼鏡（用凸透鏡製）和平光眼鏡（用平面鏡製），眼鏡的功用有二，一是遮蔽塵埃，一是矯正目光。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>問：乾電池是用什麼材料製成的？陽極和陰極在那裏？</p>
<p>答：乾電池是用炭條立在鋅製的圓筒中間，筒內實以二氧化錳，氯化錏，氯化鋅和少許焦炭粉和石墨製造成的，他的陽極（炭極）在中央，陰極（鋅極）在旁邊。</p>

<p>— 新生小學五年組生　徐紹華</p>
<p>校中的功課、我皆歡喜、不過我最喜歡的功課就耍算公民了。我所以歡喜的理由，不外下列三種：</p>
<p>（一）因爲一個人立身世界，必要知做人的道理；要知做人的道理，非研究公民書不可。</p>
<p>（二）我國人民素乏公德，只知自私自利，不顧他人的死活，大有「寗負天下人、人不可負我」的氣概。如果要改善這種壞習慣，也非要熟讀公民書不可。因爲公民書中有：「我爲人人，人人爲我，」「克己成仁。」「天下一家。」的學說，我們小學生讀了，便有深刻的印象，將來便不會有自私自利的壞習慣表現。</p>
<p>（三）我們小學生是國家未來的主人翁，不過我們做了主人翁、必須對於　義等有深切的明瞭，精細的了解、要明瞭黨義等非先從革命下手不可。因此我們要堅固我們主人翁地位計，必須研究公民書。</p>

<p>— 復興小學六年級生　石原</p>
<p>各位小朋友都知道「勤有功戲無益」這句話嗎？從這句話看來，就可知道勤是人生的根本。像做一個農人，他不勤力的去耕田，那末他將來的收成，一定是不豐富。如果做一個工人，不勤力的去作工，將來他的作品，一定是惡劣。如果做一個買賣的商人，他不勤力地去幹，那麼將來他的營業是不會發達的。由此看來，就可知道不勤的害處是何等的重大。小朋友們，如果你們在學校裏不勤力的去讀書，那末將來的結果如何呢？在我說一句，一定是學業不成吧！所以我十二萬分地盼望諸位小朋友，在學校裏要勤力用功讀書，在家裏，要勤力的做些輕便的工作，不但學業有成功之希望，而且還能够達到「不倚靠他人才算好漢」的目的。</p>

<p>— 允中小學六年級生　何美玲</p>
<p>星期日，在各機關各學校都照例放假，在學生的對於星期日，好像這是一個專門用來遊玩的日子。所以，到了星期六，大家都在互相說，「你明天到那裏去玩」「我到影戲院裹去看影戲。」「不，我到明天，一定要玩他一天呢！」在實際上，這星期日是不是專供學生遊玩的。不是的，這不過是用來休養我們的腦子的，因爲我們在星期一至星期六遭六天內我們的腦是用在課程上，一些也沒有空閒的時間。所以利用這時候來使它休息一會。但也不是完全不用它。所以，我的利用星期日是這樣的：</p>
<p>一，溫習已敎過的功課—爲什麼要溫習已敎過的功課呢？因爲我們要知道在這六天內在學校中究竟得到了些甚麼？先生所敎的，我完全懂不懂？假使有不懂的地方，記着到星期一去問先生。不然，我們知道了前面又忘記了後面，豈不是等於不讀嗎？所以我們一定要溫習已敎過的課程。</p>
<p>二，預備將敎的功課—我們在星期日也應該去預備將讀的課程。爲什麼呢？因爲你假使沒有預備，不知他的內容，底細，先生一直的講下去，你却便莫明其妙，便會覺得沒有意思，便沒心聽了，結果，便一懂也不懂。譬如讀英文沒有預備生字，先生講下去，你便不知他在講些甚麼？好像閉了眼睛在瞎摸。所以這也是一件重要的事情。</p>
<p>這二件事，在上午一定能够完畢。到了下午，我去正當的消閒或尋些正當的娛樂。</p>
<p>一，我在這下午，假使有機會，我便的了幾個同學，一同到福州路各書局中去看書。看有甚麼好的或合我心理的我便買了帶回家。到書局或圖書館中去看書這是一種很好的舉動。假使一個學生有常去的習慣。不但可消閒，並且還可增加他的知識學問。</p>
<p>二，假使我不出去，那末我便和哥哥弟妹一同玩乒乓。因爲道也是一種無害而正當的消閒品。</p>
<p>此外如下棋等各種正常娛樂都是我所喜歡玩的。</p>

<p>白雪公主的話還沒有說完，早有七個快樂的聲音，同時發了出來道：「煮煮菜麼？不是你說煮煮菜麼？」</p>
<p>公主驕傲地答道：「是啊，我甚麼菜都會煮，連點心也會做的。蘋果湯糰啊，漿果糕啊，醋栗包子啊！」</p>
<p>七矮人同聲歡呼道：「好個醋栗包子！呵呵，多好啊，多好啊！伊决定留下來了。」當下七矮人彼此攙住了手，跳起一種很簡單而又很好玩的舞式來，好像耶穌聖誕節時，地羣快樂的小孩子繞着聖誕樹跳舞一般。</p>
<p>誰知那老頑固忽然洒跳了手，退立在一旁，皺着兩眉，向那些快樂的伙伴們瞧着，一面做出一種厭惡的聲音說道：「如此你們爲了一個醋栗包子，願意冒着大險，連性命都不要了嗎？」</p>
<p>他的伙伴們一致的嚷道：「當然當然！你難道不要吃麼？那又熱又好吃的醋栗包子！</p>
<p>老頑固聽了這話，眼前彷彿已瞧見了一幅狼吞虎咽般吃着醋栗包子的圖畫，嘴裏不知不覺的充滿了唾涎，但是他仍咕噥着道：「如此也好，一切隨你們的便，那結果是一定不會好的。無論包子不包子，但伊總是一個女人！一有了女人，煩惱也就跟着來了！」</p>
<p>可是他的伙伴們竟沒有一個聽從他的話的，因爲想起了那甜美可口的醋栗包子，早已忘了那害怕王后的一回事了。</p>
<p>白雪公主忙道：「請你們恕我，此刻我得給你們料理晚餐去了。」說完，急急地跑下樓梯去，瞧伊先前所煮的湯，可已煮透了沒有？</p>
<p>七矮人聽說有晚餐可吃，也就一個個跟下樓來。當白雪公主揭起鍋蓋時，那湯的一陣陣香味，直撲到他們的鼻管裹。他們趕到餐桌旁邊，伸手搶了小湯匙在等着，饞得什麼似的。白雪公主瞧他們吃時，兀自暗暗地詫異，想他們道種貪吃的樣子，眞和小孩子們一模一樣。</p>
<p>公主柔聲說道：「晚餐還沒有完全預備好哩。你們儘有工夫去洗一個浴。」</p>
<p>他們似乎從沒有聽得過道種話似的，很詫異的同聲問這：「洗浴麼？洗浴麼？爲什麼啊？我們並不要到那裏去，况且又不是新年的時節，我們爲什麼要洗浴呢？」</p>

<h3 id="c131">賺了錢以後不要忘記繳納所得稅 <a href="#c131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— 巴盾</p>
<p>由於環境的特殊以及人口的激增，孤島上各業都得到了畸形的繁榮。在去年一年裏，簡直可以說，沒有一家不是賺得飽飽的。其中以紗花業的盈利最爲驚人。</p>
<p>筆者有一個親戚，他經營就是紗花。雖然他開設底廠規模極小，資本只有二十多萬，可是去年却賺了三十五萬，幾乎及到資本的二倍。另外據筆者所知道的，有好幾家紗花廠，年底的分紅竟達一百個月者。比如，一個五十元一月的小職員，年終分紅分到五千元之巨。說來似乎使人難以置信。但是這都是實在的情形。</p>
<p>不但紗花業如此，其他各業也都是這樣。所不同的，盈餘的多寡而已。於是不論股束，老板，職員等誰都春風滿面，皆大歡喜了。所以也無怪乎今年的廢歷新年點綴得格外熱鬧。也無怪乎，洋溢在孤島上的是一片昇平氣象</p>
<p>賺了錢而享享樂，在情理上講本來是很自然的事。不過，在你們樂哉樂哉的時候，不知道是吾記着祖國爲了自由和永存正在作着艱苦的鬥爭？</p>
<p>現代的戰爭誰都知道是經濟的戰爭。換句話說：經濟的充裕與吾，能影響於戰爭的勝負，歐戰時德國的失敗，是一個最好的例子。雖然我們政府的財政穩固而充實，而且還有各友邦的熱誠援助。但是本乎「有力出力有錢出錢」的天職以及保障最後勝利的迅速獲得，我不能不向各盈餘廠商作一個懇切的呼籲！</p>
<p>這並不是說，希望各業把盈餘全部獻給政府（能够這樣，當然最好），然而對於國民應盡的義務—所得稅以及戰時利得稅不應該有所規避而應該踴躍繳納！</p>
<p>這個意見在以前已經有不少人提出過，似乎不需要我再來嚕囌。但是據筆者從關係方面探悉，繳納所得稅者實在是太少了，於是我懇切地把它重新提出來！</p>
<p>所得稅的是一種良稅，誰都知道，毋庸我多說。然而有不能不提者，就是歐美各國，一到戰時，往往要提高所得稅的稅率以增加國庫的收入。而我政府至今還保持着原來的稅率。這顯出政府是如何的體恤民情！那末我們如果賺了錢，還要逃避這種良稅，試問你能對得起政府嗎？你能對得起你自己的良心嗎？</p>
<p>吾知道孤島上的商人都很愛國，證諸幾個月前郵局停售印花稅，而各同業公會都紛紛到內地去採購；以便照貼而維護國稅，可以說明我這句話並不是盲目的恭維。所以筆者熱切希望各業在這年關結帳後，能够踴躍的繳納所得稅和戰時利得稅。</p>

<h3 id="c134">「蘇彝士」觀感 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>廿世紀福斯出品　大光明戲院開映</p>
<p>我永遠記得李建吾先生的一句話：「要成爲一個批評家，是不容易的，至少，他要有敵得過作者的才能和學識，而像戲劇這個東西，從劇本到搬上舞台，和觀衆見面，這中間的作者是不祗一個的，以一個人和羣策羣力的作者相敵（如果作者和批評者是眞站在對立的話），那眞不大容易」。</p>
<p>李先生所講的是指戲劇，我以爲把它來作爲對電影的損評講，是更貼切。我引用它，並不是想由此推該責任，如像影評之寫不好，是理之當然，不的，完全不是那樣，我祗是想用李先生的話來說明，我歷來所寫的東西，祗是「觀後感」而不是批評、固然這是「瞎子摸象」，是「機械化部隊」，不過，我想，就將我這個瞎子「摸」到的部份來說說：也許「恰巧」有和我摸到同樣部份的觀衆，可以拿來印證一下吧；或者，別的觀衆和我摸到的不同，我也可以使他們知道我摸到的是那一部份，道，落在高明的統觀全局的專家們眼中，自然怪不順眼。然而作爲一個觀衆的意見看，也給想看戲而禾看的讀者作一個參考，給已看的人多一個印證，這觀後感之類，也不能算是完全多餘的吧。</p>
<p>像「蘇彝士」這樣影片，我對之是祇能自慚形陋的，例如對於蘇彝士運河的史地，我就知道得不能再少，而因之，對於開拓蘇彝士的功臣雷塞布，他是吾先是一個西班牙郡主的愛人，過後又有一個名呌東妮的風塵知己，我就無法來說明他是否眞實。不過我是做了「蘇彝士」的觀衆的，看了之後，當然有感；有感，而又不知進退，還是想寫下來，無他，給已看者作一個印證（看我們之間有多少出入），給未看者多一個參考而已。</p>
<p>「蘇彝士影片中的雷塞布，作者對於他，那是和對一萬古流芳」中的那位發現微菌的巴士登不同的，後者是爲他列一個畫傳，而「蘇彝士」中的雷塞布，作者却祗是把他作爲一個脚色來處理，他在銀幕上的情史也許是眞實的，不過這也眞如杜撰一個劇本那樣，需要一個情史而已。</p>
<p>說到主題，是的，這是不能說壞的，即是一個精明幹練的人物，他的完成他的事業，也必須要經歷過大苦難，並且克服大苦難。</p>
<p>誠然，「蘇彝士」的主題並不如此簡單，他多少還有替雷塞布作「別傳」的意思。或者，也如廣告所說，「說甚麼倚翠偎紅情意儂，又誰知死別生離都落空」，是和一設美國電影差不多，是爲這位雷塞布先生惋惜「死別生離都落空」，也用這個「凄艷」的題材來感動觀衆，滿足荷包的。（未完）</p>

<p>第五回　春到碧蘿香浮雪海　花飛虎阜月滿蠡湖</p>
<p>朱愛人道：「你怎麼知道她們一時不回去呢？」吳君素道：『我怎麼不知道呢？這是澹雲姊和我說的。要有機會，澹雲姊還要陪她們到西湖去游玩咧。因爲何老伯在這裏的職務，一時也未必可以就回去咧。」朱愛人道：「那就很好了，我們隨時可以到各處游玩。蘇州風景，雖不及杭州，但杭州都聚在西湖上，蘇州却散處各方，而且一時令有一時令的游玩地方。譬如初春玄墓看梅花，二三月裏，又大家游春到支硎山。夏天雇船到荷花蕩，秋天又是天平看紅葉。不但此也，近來父添了不少游玩處所，可惜我是忙於醫務，有許多地方，都不曾到過。說也笑話，連虎邱也只到過了一次。』吳君素道：「不差！說起虎邱，兩位姊姊倒可以去看看。這是代表我們蘇州的一種城市風景踐。你說它是城市吧？這七里山塘，靑山綠水，雜樹繁花，倒也有點山林景象。你說它是山林吧？上下塘店肆林立，倒也是個熱鬧市集。聽說這虎邱因爲離城近，而且不像是僩山，只稱之爲邱。在百年前，那地方就很熱鬧，不過沒有現在那樣繁華而已。近來爲了保存舊日市容關係，虎邱山塘，不許造過於高大的西式房屋，不許在那裏造大工廠。就是樓房亭閣，也要是中國式的。沿山塘也有些畫舫燈船，點綴其間，不晚中國威尼期的風景，所以歐美人到此游歷的，常常的攝了許多風景照片去。』朱愛人道：『好啦！我們現在去吃飯去，那裏去呢？君素姊！你比我熟悉些，父耍請你嚮導咧。』君素道：『這裏有兩家，算是出名的。一家喚作尊鱸居，一家便是石家飯店，這兩處都可以吃的。』何儷玉道：『我在那一種筆記上，會見這石家飯店的名目，還有什麼蘇州著名的鲃肺湯咧。原來石家飯店就在此地。」朱愛人道：『旣然儷玉姊久聞其名，我們便到石家飯店吧。』吳君素道：『此地是石家飯店的分店，他的老店還在原址。石湖之濱，就不能無石家飯店，儷玉姊要吃！肺湯，這幾天也許還有。』於是她們四人，便由閑雲水閣起身，到石家飯店米了。（五八）</p>

<p>—關於黃桂秋的配角</p>
<p>黃桂秋二度出演天蟾，邀來管紹華，杜富隆，張海臣等，一概北方角兒，陣容爲之一新，惟紹華富隆諸人，似非上選人物，（以桂秋之藝鬚生能邀貫大元奚嘯伯小生能邀高維廉陳盛泰比較當有良好成績）致桂秋不能收牡丹綠葉之效，良足惜也。</p>
<p>管紹華爲北平公餘雅集之票友，與以學侯喜瑞著稱之票友張稔年，同爲北平協和醫院職員，於三年前下海爲伶，其藝不及奚嘯伯，有謂管藝宗言三（菊朋）者，但在愚聆其歌後，可下絕對斷語，管之唱有不少王少樓成份，唸白則近乎馬連良實無絲毫言味也。管之嗓尙可，調門亦在六字以上，惟稍近左，且無準譜，（即嗓音好壞門高低，隨時有變化也。）實則功候尙淺也。日前愚觀其與桂秋合演伍家坡，大登殿，唱則頗善取巧，尙能動聽，身上台步，則未能使人滿意，聞天蟾當局，原擬邀陳少霖或王文源，第以陳王均遠在關外，於無可奈何中，邀來管紹華，其實，陳王之藝，亦不過勝管一籌而已。但陳王之嗓能保險，且演戲似有準譜，即所謂「倒底非羊毛出身也」。</p>
<p>杜富隆爲富連成出身，久隨桂秋，亦曾一度隨馬連良，藝平平，惟演戲尙稱規矩，且資格經騐均有根底，雖不及後起之葉盛蘭高維廉輩，然終不失一中駟之才。</p>
<p>張海臣，爲此次隨桂秋出演天蟾之當家花臉，其人未嘗見於平津間，或爲關外英雄，嗓頗衝，唸白帶點侯喜瑞味兒，是日愚觀其演通天犀，居然「朝天一股香」「大頂」都有，可見張之武工，頗具根底，愚初以爲此人爲一文武架子花臉，但不久曾見天蟾海報中，有張之草橋關，戲碼以文武架子花，而兼工黑頭，可稱文武不擋，而絕不可多得也。故値此花險寥若晨星局面之下，如張海臣者，値得引起顧曲人仕之注意。惟張之唸白有不少山東音，此其美中不足也。</p>
<p>至於桂秋本人，嗓音之甜亮，一如往昔，唱唸做表皆能引人入勝，以桂秋之藝，在上海準保有飯，惟配角方面，則非注意不可也。</p>

<p>姑奶奶　民國十一年初夏，小留香館主人荀慧生，應聘南來，愚與同文倪子喬劉公魯舒舍予劉豁公諸君，時至留香寓所叙談，文酒盤桓，幾無虛日。一日，公魯謂同座諸君曰：「人生聚散靡常，盍共撮一影以留紀念。」舍予曰：「本人主張拍一戲裝照，蓋取游戲三眜之意，」衆皆稱善，因議定於翌日同至南京路心心象館集合。及期，子喬豁公，因事未至，乃由愚等四人，合攝槍挑穆犬王戲像一種：留香扮穆桂英；公魯扮楊宗寶；舍予扮楊延昭；愚扮木瓜；撮影旣竣，留香笑謂余曰：一貴館中對敝館主，從此須改口矣，」愚不解其意，問「改些什麼？一留香曰：「今而後我是你的姑奶奶了，你還假裝痴呆嗎？」愚曰：「好好好，就以姑奶奶相稱可也，」公魯曰：「姑奶奶得給見面錢，否則忒便宜了姑奶奶也．」相與大笑不已。</p>
<p>九皇素　某年秋，愚與徐小麟盟弟代表高亭唱片公司赴平灌音，某日，由荀慧生灌唱，計灌玉堂春，孝義節，穆犬王，審頭剌湯四片，是日慧生嗓子特佳，二黃戲吃調在六字半以上，灌片旣竣，慧生笑謂愚曰：「這幾天吃九皇素，所以嗓子特別好，這是你們的機會，過幾天就要差些了。」愚聞言，莫明究竟，因笑問慧生曰：「吃素與嗓子有甚關係？」慧生曰：「獃哉先生！吃素和嗓子固無關係，不過吃九皇素確有很大的關係！」愚曰：「聽了這兩句話，還是不明白，這眞合翠屛山潘老丈說的，不說還淸楚，經你這麼一說，越發的糊塗了。」慧生曰：「九皇素節（九月初一至初九共九日）是我們伶界最重要的一個禁期，在這禁期內，一切都得禁忌，允其是周公之禮！」愚至是，始恍然大悟！而報以會心之一笑。以後每遇慧生灌片，愚必以「吃九皇素沒有？」一語相調笑，慧生亦必以「不吃也得吃」一語相答復，此一問一答，係愚與慧生所編定之密碼，個中人語，固非局外人所能知者，然其趣味之雋氷，正在外人之不知也。</p>

<p>— 淡雲</p>
<p>最近德國採用種種野蠻的手段，壓迫猶太人，同時，卓別林也宣佈將拍攝一部影片，暫時定名「獨裁者」，是卓別林自已編的劇本，自已扮演主角，而且全部有聲，這在卓別林自己是破天荒的傑作。卓別林自己扮演兩個主角：一個是集中營裏的囚犯，同時也扮演哪個國家的獨裁者。卓別林自己是猶太人，那末照情理推測起來，他所指的獨裁者是誰，也就顯而易見的了。據最近所得好萊塢方面的消息，卓別林拍攝這本影片是很費心血的，他自己有一個攝影塲，這部影片就在他自己的攝影塲裏拍攝，現已民開始實際工作了。</p>
<p>據卓別林攝影塲的總經理李夫斯正式宣佈說：「外面雖多謊言，但是開拍這本新片子的日期，已經預定了。卓氏在這部影片，不僅保持他一面的作風，同時也將表演另一種個性的人物。現在的卓別林攝影塲爲拍這本影片，已把地位擴大，加添了收昔的設備，增加了許多人員，因爲道張影片裏有許多巨大的羣衆塲面呢。一方面還在進行商談，預備在桑佛南度地方或其他適當的地方租借大片土地，預備拍外景。</p>
<p>總之，卓別林對於這部影片是很重視的。將來上映的時候，可以使觀衆「一新耳目」。</p>

<p>— 呆子</p>
<p>日本人利用電影藝術來麻醉中國的民衆，在武力侵略的政策中，也是一種已定的計劃。我們祗要看到東三省淪陷之後，電影院就受到日本的統制，所映的影片，可算全部由日本的影片公司供給，無非是映些「日滿支親善，」「日滿支經濟提携，」和「共同防共」一類含有政治作用的影片，使華人在不知不覺中被其麻醉。而「八一三」之後，在所有的佔領區域，對於電影，不是加以統制，便是加以嚴厲的檢查，用心听在，也昭然若揭了。</p>
<p>在上海方面，日本採用其一貫的政策，預備在虹口區域開設一家電影院，這個消息傳出已久，但最近已是具體化了，名稱是虹口日人所設的福民大戲院，已定於明日（十三日），正式開幕。這戲院就是廣東大戲院的原址，祗是把內部略加修理而已。</p>
<p>開幕日由日本歌女表演各種歌舞，虹口日籍女侍合唱。據他們傳出的消息，是日無知華人和日本居留民的將參加此開幕禮者，預料有千人之多，免費入座，當然是在誘致多量的浪人。</p>
<p>福民大戲院是隸屬於日人所設福民影片公司之下的，因此，今後該院所映的影片，也就大部為福民公司在中國攝製的影片。除了影片之外，有時將表演歌舞，戲劇等各種游藝。據日本人宣稱，華籍的舞臺演員，和歌星，舞星，和福民大戲院訂有合同，行將登臺表演的，已有多人。但確否要待事實來證明！就是確實也無非是羅致一些游藝界的敗類而已</p>

<p>身之運用法</p>
<p>（乙）身之位置</p>
<p>身之位置，變化無窮，實難以詞達之，如做同一花樣，各人之身法可無一雷同者。但身上各部動作之位置，則不外乎下列四式：</p>
<p>順　客肩客臂客腿客臀均在前，或均在後。</p>
<p>逆　客肩客臂在前，客腿客臀在後，或客肩客臂在後，客腿客臀在前。</p>
<p>前　客腿在主足趾之前。</p>
<p>後　客腿在主足跟之後。</p>
<p>以上所述前後順逆之各種動作，又可化成四式如下：</p>
<p>（甲）後順　客腿在主足跟之後，客肩客臂亦在後。</p>
<p>（乙）前順　客腿在主足趾之前，客肩客臂亦在前。</p>
<p>（丙）後逆　客腿在主足跟之後，客肩客臂在前</p>
<p>（丁）前逆　客腿在主足趾之前，客肩客臂在後。</p>
<p>外進第一式主肩在前，客肩客臂愈在後愈好，客腿客臀在後，目之視向，對主肩之上與行動方向。</p>
<p>下圖為第一式，又各後順。</p>
<p>前述之四式，與後述之四邊，均有密切關係，每足之四邊，均有此四式之主要姿勢，邊有四種，即外進，內進，外退，內退。每邊身之位置，亦各有四式，前順，前逆，後順後逆。故左右兩足，共計可化成三十二勢。即每足各有十六勢，右足之十六勢如圖狀，左足則依此類推可也。</p>

<p>在　一切武劇中，結構最佳，配搭最齊，塲子最緊，命意最善的生，凈，丑，合演的羣戲裹，就要推全本「連環套」為首屈一指了。這齣戲共分為五大段落：第一是注重在「竇爾墩盜馬，」第二是注重在「調天霸晋京；」第三是注重在「天霸拜山；」第四是注重在「朱光祖盜鉤；」第五是注重在「山上比武」說服竇爾墩獻出御馬，晋京打官司，這齣戲也就算告一結束了。</p>
<p>是劇雖算以武生为主角，但是副凈與武丑都也十分吃重，例如「盜御馬」就完全是凈角的戲，「盜雙鉤」完全是丑角的戲，「拜山」是生凈同樣吃重的。最末一塲又似乎開口跳「即武丑」的唸白及表作的地方較多，這一齣戲既是如此的編排支配法，而充主角的却偏以武生任之，這不是編戲的人有些不以麽？其實不然，因為武生在「晋京引見」叩拜彭中堂時，確有很精彩的唱，作，表情，唸白，都須在這時現出來。倘是沒有根基的武生扮演天霸一角，不光是在跑圓塲時先露出他的腿工幼稚，身體呆笨，即在「報門」時一氣二十幾個字一句的唸白裏，也能顯出他的嗓音，衷氣，尖團字等是否曾下過研究功夫，經過名人指點，老於顧曲的人們，一瞧這兩下子，就可料定他以下是否能勝任愉快，够不够充任這齣戲裏主角的資格了。所以楊小樓演來，的確堪稱古今一絕，第一他先能適合一位副將的身分，而且表現天霸在他的羣衆裏，也眞配當一個小領袖，故而朱光祖，何路通，計全，關泰，金大力等水旱兩路英雄，全都披心瀝胆的擁護着他，始終不渝。縱或天霸有時因性情噪急，語言中唐突了那位，然而一經解釋之後。則交情仍復如初，雙方全無芥蒂之心。像他們這樣的一個團體，在社會上才能。永久存在，所謂共存共榮，把一個頭目人捧起來啦，大家也全有光彩了。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Guilin Telegram: The military reorganization and replenishment conference convened by the Southwest Headquarters, which opened on the 5th, has concluded. Over a hundred military leaders attended, including Chairman Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, Liang Hancao, and others. The conference lasted five days. The first three days were devoted to reports, focusing on the difficulties faced by various armies. The latter two days were spent discussing proposals, all in accordance with the spirit of the Changsha and Nanyue conferences, and several implementation measures were agreed upon. Each war zone will practice coordinated offensive tactics and observe each other's performance. Bai Chongxi stated in his address that the enemy has suffered 700,000 casualties, mobilized 1.5 million troops, and used up to 32 divisions, spending twenty months. What they have gained is nothing but failures and signs of decline. We, on the other hand, are moving towards rebirth and progress. The future is shining with limitless victorious light.

<p>Xingji: Japanese troops besieging Jingle are advancing under the cover of aircraft and artillery on the eastern front. The entire town of Kangjiahui has been reduced to scorched earth. They invaded the county seat on the afternoon of the 5th. A certain Chinese commander personally went to the front line to command, winning a victory in the area north of Yong'an. Officers such as Tsumagi Tadanari, Masuda Katsumi, and non-commissioned officers and soldiers numbering two to three hundred were killed. One unit pursued south, while another advanced north, recapturing Ninghuabao. The entire northern front is now victorious, and there are reports that Ningwu City has also been recovered. On the western front, Chinese troops counterattacked Kudongyukou and, at 2:00 AM on the 7th, recaptured Dawu.

<p>Yuanqu: Whenever Japanese troops in the Jiangxian, Xiaxian, and Wenxi areas of southern Shanxi come into contact with the Chinese army at close range, Japanese soldiers often defect and surrender, shouting "Treat prisoners well!" The Chinese army treats them kindly and accommodates them, which proves that anti-war sentiment is high within the Japanese army and is as unstoppable as a burst dam. (Telegram on the 11th)</p>

<p>Southern Hubei and Northern Hunan: Japanese Troops Hemmed into a Corner; Facing Unprecedented Difficulties; Constantly Repelled by the Chinese Army Near the Suburbs of Tongyue</p>
<p>Changsha: Continuous rain in Southern Hubei and Northern Hunan has quieted the battlefield. The Japanese troops entrenched in Tongcheng and Yuezhou are reinforcing their fortifications, preparing for a long defense. Observers believe that the Japanese army has encountered unprecedented and significant difficulties since invading the Xiang-E Highway and the northern section of the Yuehan Railway. The most obvious difficulties are as follows: First, the Japanese army is closely monitored on all sides by regular Chinese troops and guerrilla units, and is constantly subjected to surprise attacks and ambushes. Advancing means sinking deeper and deeper, while retreating means facing thorns everywhere. Second, in the mountainous areas of the Hunan-Hubei border region, modern transportation tools have become ineffective. Even minor troop movements require crossing paddy fields or climbing mountains. Not only is it impossible to move heavy weapons, but even foot soldiers suffer from the difficulty of travel. This kind of primitive living is by no means something that the Japanese army can adapt to. Third, morale is growing stronger with each battle. Every household is increasingly filled with hatred for the enemy and a desire for revenge. They have thoroughly understood the deception and enslavement of the Japanese and are even more willing to contribute all they have to meet the Chinese army's needs. The military and the people have formed an even stronger cooperative front, making it impossible for the Japanese army to implement its evil schemes. As a result, for four months, the Japanese troops who invaded the Hunan-Hubei border region have been constantly repelled by the Chinese army near the suburbs of Tongcheng and Yuezhou, making no progress whatsoever.

<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo Dispatch: (1) The Japanese Ministry of the Army has recently transferred all commanders on various fronts who are suspected of being anti-war back to Japan. The number is quite large, causing great consternation in Japanese government and society. Kikuchi Takeo, a member of the Japanese House of Peers, severely questioned Itagaki in the Diet the other day. According to Itagaki's reply, commanders should not be transferred lightly without special necessity, but allowing such anti-war elements to remain in the troops could lead to incalculable consequences. The government's actions in this matter are truly unavoidable. (2) Anti-war sentiment has also been growing stronger in the Kwantung Army recently. Over four hundred people have been transferred back to Japan on suspicion of being anti-war, and seventy-two of them have been executed. (Telegram on the 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Commemorating the Founding Father and the Second Phase of the War of Resistance Propaganda Week <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Today is the 14th anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China. At this time, the Republic of China founded by Dr. Sun is struggling in extreme suffering; Dr. Sun's Zhongshan Mausoleum, where he is buried, has also been occupied by demons for a year and three months. Every Chinese citizen today cannot help but feel infinite sorrow! Especially the citizens of the isolated island (Shanghai), even the most common way to commemorate Dr. Sun today, such as planting trees, is restricted by bayonets, and there is no way to go to the suburbs. How tragic and indignant is this! However, what use is there in commemorating the Founding Father solely with emotional sorrow and indignation?</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen has been dead for fourteen years, and these fourteen years represent half the time that the Republic of China has existed since its founding. During this half of the time, China has been facing a crisis that Dr. Sun did not live to see, but that he had anticipated. All of Dr. Sun's instructions to his followers and the people were designed as solutions based on this accurate prediction. If Dr. Sun were still alive today, the only instruction he would give to the Chinese people would be resistance, because only resistance can accomplish Dr. Sun's lifelong commitment to "China's freedom and equality." The value of the greatest figures in history is often discovered more and more over time. Dr. Sun's great spirit has been accumulated year after year in this way, and on the 14th anniversary of his death today, that is, nearly two years into the War of Resistance, it is even more radiant, illuminating the universe.</p>
<p>We can illustrate how Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit becomes greater over time from the following examples. First, Dr. Sun was the first person in China to discover the power of the people. His loud call to "awaken the people" indeed resulted in the success of the Great Revolution of the 15th and 16th years of the Republic due to the cooperation of the people. Unfortunately, the power of the people was ignored in the subsequent ten years, until the sound of the cannons of the War of Resistance sounded, and the people's movement was actively noted again, and the cornerstone of the final victory was laid on the unified strength of the people. Second, Dr. Sun's instruction that China's way out must be to "unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and fight together" has not been actively developed during the past ten years. Until the recent process of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people realized that the country that Dr. Sun wished to associate with before his death was indeed China's first true friend. At the same time, certain European and American powers have also been inspired by the spirit of China's War of Resistance and have become closely linked with China; and China, under the principle of "those who have the Way find much assistance," must also use the assistance of friendly countries to complete the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction. Third, when Dr. Sun reorganized the Kuomintang in the early part of the 13th year of the Republic, he accommodated the inclusion of communists to jointly participate in the National Revolution of the Three People's Principles, which indeed shone brightly in the history of the revolution of the 15th and 16th years of the Republic. Unfortunately, in the following ten years, the two major parties went from friends to enemies, resulting in a long period of civil war, which reduced countless valuable national strength. Until the foreign troubles became increasingly urgent, the call for a united front resounded throughout the land, and the Kuomintang and the Communist Party once again sincerely cooperated, and the great work of resistance and national reconstruction could be effectively carried out. The above are several examples of Dr. Sun's great enlightenment, which have gradually been recognized as truth due to the progress of time and facts. However, above the above points, Dr. Sun also left two precious treasures to the Chinese people: one is the Three People's Principles, which indicate the highest principles for China's national construction; and the other is a wise leader who leads China's actual national construction work. These two treasures are the true core of national revival and the construction of a new China, and China can only rely on the operation of this core to become stronger and stronger in war and move towards the road to victory. In short, when the Chinese people commemorate Dr. Sun today, they should transcend emotional sorrow, use reason and will, recognize his immortal and great spirit, undoubtedly follow his teachings, and under the leadership of the leader he left to the people, jointly complete the great cause of resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>Today is also the first day of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance Propaganda Week in Shanghai. Five months have passed since the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance. Facts have shown that China's War of Resistance has now entered a favorable stage. All aspects, whether military, political, reconstruction, or cultural, are revealing a glimmer of dawn. However, in order to promote the early arrival of dawn, it is necessary to make everyone understand the characteristics of the second phase of the War of Resistance and to universally develop the work of resistance and national reconstruction. The citizens of Shanghai today may well take participation in the War of Resistance Propaganda Week as a concrete expression of their commemoration of the Premier. Regardless of gender or occupation, everyone should do their best and contribute their strength. Before today, some may or may not have actively participated in the work of resistance and national reconstruction; from today onwards, everyone must actively participate.</p>

<p>Chongqing: Guiding Principles of the National Spiritual Mobilization,</p>
<p>(1) Introduction: Since the start of the War of Resistance, more than a year and a half has passed. Thanks to the solidarity of our entire nation and the courage of our soldiers, we have frustrated the arrogance of the enemy and depleted their strength. Our national reputation has increased, and the world looks at us with new eyes. However, the second phase of the War of Resistance has now begun. The days ahead are long, and the efforts our people need to make to overcome the difficulties will be even greater than in the previous phase. The enemy now knows that military force alone is not enough to subdue us and achieve their goals. Therefore, their latest plan is to use various methods to shake our will and threaten our spirit. We are well aware of the profound foreign threats in our country's history, all because the officials and scholars were intimidated by the enemy in spirit and failed to exert the strong power of our nation everywhere. The examples of the Song and Ming dynasties serve as a profound lesson. Therefore, those in positions of responsibility today should pay particular attention to invigorating and concentrating the spirit. In short, in the past, the War of Resistance emphasized both military affairs and spirit. However, in the second phase, which is the later stage of the War of Resistance, spirit is undoubtedly more important than military affairs. Only the strong and unyielding spirit of the entire nation can overcome difficulties and break the enemy's insidious plan to win through spiritual subjugation. Looking back at the struggles of the past eighteen months and examining our shortcomings, the lack of material conditions is indeed obvious, but the inadequacy of spiritual conditions is even more difficult to deny. Modern warfare is a war of total national mobilization. Therefore, we must not only mobilize all domestic materials and manpower, but also mobilize the spirit of the entire nation. To mobilize the spirit of the entire nation to enrich the national strength for the War of Resistance, it is not only important to initiate, but also to organize. We must use organized spirit to unleash organized manpower and utilize organized materials to meet the current needs of the nation. Moreover, the significance of this War of Resistance is not only limited to eliminating the invasion of the brutal enemy, but also lies in striving to establish a permanent foundation for national construction after the war. The importance of the task and the greatness of the mission will be unprecedented in our country's history. Looking back at today's society, although the foundation of unity has been laid, spiritual unity has not yet been achieved. Although expressions of loyalty, courage, and striving are abundant, a state of decadence and disorganization also exists simultaneously. The organization is lax, and the foundation is weak. How can such a national spirit bear the great responsibility of the nation's rise and fall? Looking at the past and considering the future, we cannot but recognize that the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization is the most urgent task today. The so-called National Spiritual Mobilization, in terms of its literal meaning, means that for individuals, it is to concentrate all their consciousness, thoughts, wisdom, and spiritual strength in one direction and improve its use. For the entire nation, it is to concentrate the spiritual strength of all citizens of different ages, occupations, thoughts, and lives on one goal and jointly encourage it to enhance it, regulate it to unleash it, and determine the center of organization to enhance the efficiency of its unleashing. However, the expression of spiritual strength is morality, and its unleashing must be based on faith. The ancients said, "Success or failure depends on one or two." This is true in all things, especially in military affairs, especially when our people are in a battle where survival is at stake. Therefore, in today's China, the meaning of National Spiritual Mobilization should be to gather the spirit of the entire nation towards a simple common goal, so that the entire nation establishes the same patriotic morality for themselves and firmly establishes the same nation-building faith for the nation. Every member of the nation can strive and sacrifice for the same faith based on the same moral concept. What is stated here may seem very commonplace, but the revival of the Chinese nation must come from this path. If we can truly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization with the unity of the entire country, then any difficulties can be borne, any obstacles can be overcome, and the final victory is inevitable. Conversely, if the people cannot understand and practice this, or if their understanding is not genuine and their practice is not consistent, then the national crisis will intensify, and defeating the enemy will become more difficult. Therefore, the future of the War of Resistance and the success or failure, safety, or danger of the nation's destiny all depend on the one act of the National Spiritual Mobilization. Here, we elaborate on the essential meaning and discuss it in sections, hoping that our people will unanimously accept and practice it.</p>
<p>(2) Common Goals: The National Spiritual Mobilization has three simple and obvious common goals that are easy for everyone to understand and implement. They should be highlighted first, namely: (1) The nation is supreme, the race is supreme; (2) Military affairs are first, victory is first; and (3) Concentrate willpower, concentrate strength.</p>
<p>The Nation is Supreme, the Race is Supreme</p>
<p>The nation is supreme, the race is supreme. All our people today, whether wise or foolish, should have deeply felt that under the circumstances where the survival of the nation is under severe threat, no individual or their career can be guaranteed safety. The enemy's desire to eliminate our national consciousness and break up our national unity will first be piecemeal and divided, and then humiliated and annihilated. Their ambition and insidious plan have become increasingly clear. Therefore, consolidating the survival of the nation should take precedence over everything else. However, the highest system of national life is the state. Without a state, national life cannot be maintained and developed. A nation that has lost its country, like the Jews, is subject to being slaughtered by others. How tragic! Therefore, consolidating the country should undoubtedly take precedence over everything else. Therefore, we must recognize today that the nation is supreme, the race is supreme, and the interests of the nation and the race should be above all else. In front of the nation and the race, we should sacrifice all personal opinions, selfishness, private interests, and even the freedom and lives of our entire family without regret.</p>
<p>Military Affairs First, Victory First</p>
<p>(2) Military Affairs First, Victory First: During this military period of resolving the survival of the nation, the greatest interest of the nation is military interest. Therefore, all thoughts and actions of the people should be absolutely subject to the control of the national and racial military interests. In order to achieve military interests and to increase military interests, the nation may demand all sacrifices from the people, and the people themselves must actively and enthusiastically contribute everything they have. Therefore, it is said that military affairs are first. The only purpose of military affairs is to seek victory. Therefore, the people must establish the belief that they will win and achieve the goal of final victory, exhausting all their knowledge, abilities, time, and energy to seek military victory. During this period, there should be no so-called personal gains, losses, interests, or personal humiliations and honors. Only achieving military victory is the glory shared by all our people, and only failing to achieve victory is everyone's greatest shame. All merits and demerits, all right and wrong, should be based on this as the standard. Therefore, it is also said that victory is first.</p>
<p>Concentrate Willpower, Concentrate Strength</p>
<p>(2) Concentrate Willpower, Concentrate Strength: Now that our country is in a time of national emergency for self-defense, all citizens should concentrate all their willpower and concentrate all their strength. All citizens with reason and conscience should have no time for other thoughts or actions at this time other than to do their best to safeguard the country and seek victory. From the perspective of the nation, it is also necessary to require the absolute unity and concentration of the thoughts of the entire people on the two meanings of the nation being supreme, the race being supreme, military affairs being first, and victory being first. There is no room for disagreement or doubt, and no room for other empty thoughts or theories. Furthermore, it is necessary to mobilize all citizens in all occupations and all departments to work together with one heart and one mind, to strive for the military interests of the nation in the midst of hardship, each doing their best and each fulfilling their duties, to improve everything, create everything, to implement long-term military plans, and at the same time achieve the completion of our nation-building work. Therefore, it is said that willpower should be concentrated and strength should be concentrated. The above three meanings are simple and clear, and the matters are very easy to implement. The people must be happy to accept this and must accept it unanimously. Please further discuss the same morality that we want to establish and determine the content of the same faith.</p>
<p>The Morality of Saving the Nation Lies in Loyalty and Filial Piety</p>
<p>(3) The Morality of Saving the Nation: China needs to revitalize itself, resist foreign invaders, and save the country. Therefore, the same morality that our entire nation needs to strive to practice today is the morality of saving the nation, which is also the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace advocated by Sun Yat-sen. The people may have shallow or deep understanding of these eight virtues, but the continuous greatness of the Chinese nation has been inherited from this morality. The current decline is due to the loss of this morality. Therefore, it is necessary to require our people to unanimously establish this morality of saving the nation. Among the eight virtues, the most fundamental are loyalty and filial piety. Only loyalty and filial piety are the great foundation for the establishment of the Chinese nation. For five thousand years, the ancestors have left this precious legacy to future generations. Now, in a time of national crisis, all compatriots must be loyal and filial, do their utmost loyalty to the country, and practice their great filial piety to the nation.</p>
<p>Practice Great Filial Piety Towards the Nation</p>
<p>Please first talk about filial piety. For thousands of years, the so-called filial piety in Chinese society has not only been about fulfilling filial piety to one's parents, but also about fulfilling filial piety to one's ancestors. Therefore, having no descendants to continue the ancestral sacrifices is the greatest form of unfilial piety. When Sun Yat-sen talked about nationalism, he promoted and expanded the inherent filial piety of China and extended it to the relationship between fellow countrymen and fellow tribesmen. Therefore, the object of our filial piety today should be the entire nation. We should strive not to let down the common ancestors of our nation. We should always remember the beautiful rivers and mountains that our hundreds of generations of common ancestors worked so hard to create and leave to us. If we lose them in our hands, how can we face our ancestors above and our common descendants below? Other crimes can be redeemed, but unfilial piety cannot be redeemed. If our compatriots understand this meaning, then sacrificing oneself to maintain the survival of the nation must be regarded as the highest responsibility of everyone.</p>
<p>Do Utmost Loyalty to the Country</p>
<p>The so-called loyalty must first be loyalty to the country. Loyalty to the country is actually the way to preserve the survival and development of the nation. In today's China, everyone must take the protection of national independence as a sacred responsibility. Only then can the country be saved. The state has its absoluteness. If you want to maintain the freedom and independence of the country, the prerequisite is the absolute unity of military and political orders. Now that the brutal enemy is using great force to destroy our country and is creating pseudo-organizations in various occupied areas in an attempt to divide our country, all our people must be loyal to the country to strengthen the country's self-defense forces, be loyal to their duties, be loyal to discipline, and be loyal to the law. Never allow the slightest idea of disunity or violate the law to reduce the authority of the state. If the Chinese people can truly do their filial piety to the nation and their loyalty to the country, then the mission of resisting foreign aggression and saving the country will have people who can truly bear it. As for virtues such as benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, they all evolved from the two meanings of loyalty and filial piety. Benevolence and love are an extension of filial piety, and faith and righteousness are an extension of loyalty. Benevolence and love will prevent mutual killing. If we can promote benevolence and love today, we will not sit idly by while our compatriots are insulted and killed, and we will have the courage to share the enemy's hatred. If we promote faith and righteousness, we will be able to be responsible and fulfill our duties, be honest and sincere, and create unity to face difficulties together. If we promote our inherent ideal of loving peace for thousands of years, we will be happy to fight against violence and seek permanent peace, and we must take the lead in striving bravely and relentlessly. When all these virtues of saving the nation are brought into play, they are no different from strong armor and sharp weapons. In short, this is the spiritual weapon of the nation, and everyone should use it to arm themselves to drive out the brutal enemy and create a new and glorious history for our country.</p>
<p>The Nation-Building Principles are the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>(4) The Nation-Building Faith: What is the ultimate goal of our demanding that our people move in the same direction, establish the same morality, and strive hard without fear of hardship? It is to complete the construction of a country based on the Three Principles of the People. As mentioned earlier, the significance of this War of Resistance is not only to resist the enemy, but also to establish the foundation of nation-building. Therefore, even in wartime, we must never forget nation-building. Only by having a consistent and established nation-building policy and promoting it with all our strength can we fully unleash the power to resist aggression and seek victory. Only when the entire nation can establish the faith of nation-building can the spiritual strength and morality of saving the nation have a solid foundation for active development. Therefore, saving the nation and building the nation are inherently consistent in meaning and the same in purpose. The highest principle of China's nation-building is the Three Principles of the People created by Sun Yat-sen. This is recognized by all compatriots in the country. Today, the fate of the nation is at stake. If the War of Resistance is won, then nation-building will be achieved, and the nation will be able to enjoy permanent happiness and benefit. Therefore, our people must have a common faith and common struggle in the Three Principles of the People under our nation-building principles and seek its realization. The purpose of the Three Principles of the People is to seek equality in international status, equality in political status, and equality in economic status. We should seek the independence, freedom, and equality of the country for the people to have, by the people to govern, and for the people to enjoy. This is the common desire of everyone, and the Three Principles of the People is the only way to achieve this national construction. Now, in wartime, people's hearts are uplifted, and the trend is even more consistent. Saving the nation and building the nation should be advanced side by side. In terms of nationalism, resisting foreign aggression to seek the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation is the only purpose of the War of Resistance today. The joint efforts of all ethnic groups in the country to shoulder the burden of resisting aggression and reviving the nation can further enhance the unity of the entire nation and lay a solid foundation for the vast Republic of China. In terms of the Principle of Democracy, the wartime popularization of national political knowledge is sufficient to accelerate the cultivation of genuine democracy. The concentration and adjustment of the wartime government's powers are sufficient to create a highly efficient government. In terms of the Principle of Livelihood, the wartime efforts to increase production and control consumption are to establish people's livelihood. As a result of the state's implementation of wartime economic policies based on the Principle of Livelihood, both public and private industries will have balanced and rational development after the war, and the majority of the people will use wartime life, wartime actions, and wartime spirit to strive for production, strive for creation, and thus gain progress and prosperity. Following this path, the establishment of a new country based on the Three Principles of the People will be achieved when the War of Resistance wins a glorious victory, and the foundation of China's eternal peace and happiness will be laid. The future is bright and clearly in sight. This is what our people should strive for with one heart, excitement, and common effort, and the way to do so begins with our people's consistent and firm establishment of the same nation-building faith.

<p>Peiping: After the new regulations on the circulation of "Federal Reserve" banknotes in North China were implemented yesterday, some panic arose here. However, today, according to reliable claims, Peiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai are included in the "United Zone," and this panic has been eliminated. Anyone found carrying legal tender in these cities and other cities in the "United Zone" will be fined and their legal tender confiscated. In addition to the above four cities, the "United Zone" also contains seven cities in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan: Jinan, Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Shanhaiguan, Linqing, and Xinxiang. The remaining areas of North China are considered "bandit areas," and legal tender will continue to circulate, but it must be exchanged for "Federal Reserve" banknotes at a discount set by the government.

<p>(Moscow) The 18th Communist Party Congress held its opening ceremony in the Kremlin today. Stalin delivered a lengthy speech discussing the aggression of Germany, Italy, and Japan, stating briefly: "This kind of imperialist war is launched by various aggressor countries, infringing on the interests of various non-aggressor countries such as Britain, the United States, and France in various ways. The step-by-step retreat and repeated concessions to the aggressors by various democratic countries, so that the world and the sphere of influence are openly re-divided, is now clearly presented to us. Various non-aggressive countries sacrifice their interests without any intention of resisting, and even tacitly approve of it. Although this is difficult to believe, it is a fact. The policy of non-intervention is tantamount to tacitly approving aggression. Plans for peace and disarmament have become relics of the past. Various propaganda speeches about the Munich Agreement have begun a new era of appeasement, and no one believes them anymore. Even the countries that signed the agreement do not trust such rhetoric. The Soviet Union cannot ignore such ominous events and has made great efforts to enhance the war preparations of the navy and army." (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Stalin's Report</p>
<p>(Moscow) At the first meeting of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union yesterday, General Secretary Stalin presented a report on the work of the Central Committee. The foreign policy section did not show any significant changes, and it seems unlikely that there will be any major changes as rumored by certain foreigners. Stalin said, "We love peace and are willing to promote commercial relations with all countries, as long as those countries maintain the same relationship with us and do not harm our national interests, we can live in peace. Countries that border our country should also maintain good-neighborly relations with us, provided that those countries do not directly or indirectly attempt to harm our country's territorial integrity and the inviolability of our borders. The Soviet Union is willing to provide assistance to nations that are invaded and struggling for national independence and is not afraid of the threats of aggressor countries. If warlike countries violate our country's territorial integrity and attack our country, they will be retaliated against doubly."</p>
<p>Our country has made great progress in economics, politics, and culture, and has become united in spirit and politics. Our navy and army are becoming increasingly strong, and we are pursuing a policy of peace. The workers of all countries are also providing us with spiritual sympathy, and all countries also have the common sense of understanding, not seeking illegitimate interests by destroying peace. All of these serve as the backing for our country's foreign policy. At this time, the Second World War instigated by imperialism has already been launched, with the aim of re-dividing the world. Although Germany, Italy, and Japan use various excuses to conceal their true intentions, their struggle with Britain, France, and the United States is a real situation.</p>
<p>At this point, Stalin also imitated the tone of the authorities of Germany, Italy, and Japan and said, "If it is said that we are fighting against the interests held by Britain, France, and the United States, it is a ridiculous fallacy. We are fighting against the Communist International, not against Britain, France, and the United States. Those who doubt my words should review the public documents of the Anti-Comintern Pact." (The representatives in the field laughed when they heard this) It should be known that war is an open fact and cannot be concealed from the eyes and ears of the world by any sophistry. Japan has already seized vast lands in China, Italy has already seized Abyssinia, and Germany has already seized Austria and the Sudetenland. Germany and Italy have also joined forces to seize Spain. All of these facts are clear and obvious. How can the Axis, the Triple Alliance, etc. conceal them? War is war, and an aggressive group is an aggressive group, that's all."</p>
<p>Among the bourgeois countries, there is a distinction between aggressor countries and non-aggressor countries. The non-stop concessions of non-aggressor countries are due to fewer fears of revolutionaries (revolution must have a world nature in wartime). The main reason is that the non-aggressor countries, including Britain and France, have abandoned the principle of collective security and do not adopt a policy of collective resistance to aggression. As long as the fire is not burning their eyebrows, they maintain a neutral attitude. "It seems that the Western European countries consider it a good idea to sweep the snow in front of their own doors, but in fact, they are very wrong. Not only that, but Britain and France also plan to shift Germany's line of sight, causing it to change its development towards the Soviet Union's Ukrainian Republic. This kind of strategy will lead to irreparable defeat, and it should be dealt with with extreme caution." Some politicians and reporters in European countries and the United States are impatient to wait for Germany to expand its power to the Ukrainian Republic, and they have even revealed the inside story and openly stated that Germany's halt to its advance towards the Soviet Union and its turn to Western European countries to demand colonies is disappointing. The policy of non-intervention that it has promoted has been fully revealed." In fact, those who want the Ukrainian Republic to secede from the Soviet Union can be said to be very unthinking. It is difficult to promote the separation of 700,000 residents of the Carpathian Ukrainian province in Czechoslovakia, let alone the 30 million residents of the Soviet Union's Ukrainian Republic. In short, the policy of the Soviet Union focuses on maintaining peace and maintaining good-neighborly relations with all countries, but all countries must also adopt the same attitude to get along with each other. This is the way to long-term peace and stability. The Soviet Union's military strength has been strengthened, and it can deal with those who come to provoke it calmly. (Eleventh Havas)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Stalin: Full Report <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The full text of Stalin's report is as follows:</p>
<p>"Since the 17th Congress, five years have passed. As you all know, these five years have been by no means insignificant. The world has undergone major changes, and the relations between countries have changed greatly in many respects. But what are the changes in the international situation and the international and domestic position of our country during this period? For capitalist countries, this period has been one of extremely serious changes in both economic and political terms.</p>
<p>Economically, this period began with a period of depression, and from the second half of 1937, it became a period of new economic panic, a period of renewed decline in the industry of the United States, Britain, and France, and consequently a period of new economic turmoil. Politically, this period was one of serious political conflicts and changes. A new imperialist war has been going on for two years, taking place in a vast area from Shanghai to the Strait of Gibraltar, involving a population of over 500 million. The map of Asia, Europe and Africa is being redrawn by force. The entire system after the war, the so-called peaceful order, has been shaken from its roots. For the Soviet Union, the opposite is true. This is a period of growth and prosperity, a period of further economic and cultural progress, a period of further growth of political and economic power, and a period of striving to safeguard world peace. This is the general situation. Below, we will continue to examine the specific facts of the changes in the international situation. "The economic panic that began in capitalist countries in the second half of 1929 lasted until the end of 1933. After that, the panic turned into a depression, followed by a certain recovery, and a certain amount of industrial progress began. However, this economic recovery did not develop into the prosperity of a normal recovery period. On the contrary, from the second half of 1937, a new economic panic began to strangle the United States first, and then spread to Britain, France, and other countries. In this way, capitalist countries were hit by a new economic panic before they had recovered from the previous economic panic. This situation naturally made unemployment even more serious. The number of unemployed in capitalist countries had already decreased from 30 million in 1933 to 14 million in 1937, but now it has increased again to 18 million due to the new economic panic. The characteristics of this new panic, although different from the last panic in many respects, are worse rather than better in all these respects. "First, the new economic panic did not begin after a period of industrial prosperity, as in 1929, but began after a period of depression and a certain recovery that failed to develop to the level of prosperity. This means that the current panic will be more serious and more difficult to resist than the last panic. Secondly, the current panic did not occur in peacetime, but at a time when the Second Imperialist War had already begun, that is, Japan, which had been fighting in China for the second year, was disrupting China's huge market, making it almost impossible for other countries to import goods, Germany and Italy had already put their national economies on a wartime economic basis, and had thus exhausted their raw materials and currency resources, and all other major capitalist powers were just beginning to transform their economies on a wartime basis. This means that capitalism will lack more resources to escape the new panic in a normal way than it did during the last panic. Finally, this panic is different from the last in that it is not universal, but for the time being only extends to countries with strong economic power that have not yet implemented a wartime economic system. As for the aggressor countries such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, they have reorganized their economic systems on a wartime basis, and therefore, due to the extreme development of the war industry, they have not yet reached the stage of panic of overproduction, although they are approaching that stage. This means that when the non-aggressor countries with strong economic power begin to emerge from the panic period in the future, the aggressor countries, after exhausting their gold and raw material reserves in the heat of the war, will enter a period of extremely severe panic." "If we take a look at the visible gold reserves of various capitalist countries, we can understand this point. At the end of 1936, the visible gold reserves of all capitalist countries, in millions of old gold dollars, totaled 12,980, of which the United States accounted for 6,649, the United Kingdom 2,029, France 1,769, the Netherlands 289, Belgium 373, Switzerland 387, Germany 16, Italy 123, and Japan 273. By September 1938, the total was 14,301, of which the United States accounted for 8,126, the United Kingdom 2,396, France 1,435, the Netherlands 595, Belgium 307, Germany 17, Italy 124, and Japan 97. The unit of the numbers is millions of gold dollars.</p>
<p>The following figures are sufficient to show the dynamics of the industrial panic in capitalist countries and the progress of Soviet industry over the past five years.</p>
<p>Assuming that industrial production in 1929 is 100%, then industrial production in the United States in 1934 was 66.4%, in 1935 it was 75.6%, in 1936 it was 88.1%, in 1937 it was 92.2%, and in 1938 it was 72%. In the United Kingdom, in 1934 it was 98.8%, in 1935 it was 105.8%, in 1936 it was 115.9%, in 1937 it was 123.7%, and in 1938 it was 112%. The percentages for France by year were 71 in 1934, 67.4 in 1935, 79.3 in 1936, 82.8 in 1937, and 70 in 1938. In Italy, it was 80 in 1934, 93.8 in 1935, 87.5 in 1936, 99.6 in 1937, and 96 in 1938. In Germany, it was 79.8 in 1934, 94 in 1935, 106.3 in 1936, 117.2 in 1937, and 125 in 1938. In Japan, it was 128.7 in 1934, 141.8 in 1935, 151.1 in 1936, 170.8 in 1937, and 165 in 1938. In the Soviet Union, it was 238.3 in 1934, 293.4 in 1935, 382.3 in 1936, 42.4 in 1937, and 477 in 1938. (To be continued)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita, in response to a question in the Lower House yesterday regarding Britain's loan to China, declared that the result of this step by Britain would inevitably strengthen Chiang Kai-shek. Arita continued that the Japanese government is now considering lodging a protest with London. Regarding the same issue, Prime Minister Hiranuma also made a detailed statement, saying that Japan will do its best to overcome all difficulties in its Far Eastern policy. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita, in response to questioning in the Diet yesterday, strongly stated Japan's hope to strengthen economic relations between Japan, Germany, and Italy. It is said that if an economic agreement is beneficial to Japan, the Japanese government will consider concluding an economic agreement with any country in the world, and strengthening the economic alliance between Japan and Germany or Japan and Italy is particularly important. Japan and Germany have already begun negotiations on economic issues between the two countries, but a detailed investigation has not yet been conducted. The Hochi Shimbun today published an editorial, discussing commercial treaties, recalling that commercial treaties have already been concluded between Japan and Italy, and that German and Japanese representatives have been negotiating in Berlin to conclude a commercial treaty since 1937. If a new commercial treaty between Japan and Germany is concluded, the commercial ties between Japan, Germany, and Italy can become closer. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) During yesterday's Diet debate on taxation, it was revealed that Japan's monetary policy in Central and South China is. A spokesperson for the Asia Development Board, in response to a question, said that in view of "the current status of the National Government's currency," it is not easy to include Central and South China in the Japanese yen bloc. However, the government is currently considering this matter in order to gradually place Central and South China in the Japanese yen bloc. Finance Minister Ishiwata acknowledged that there is some "necessity" to keep Central and South China outside the Japanese yen bloc because Japan needs to trade with various parts of China that can supply Japan with foreign currency. However, he also emphasized that these areas must not be absolutely outside the Japanese yen bloc, such as the large circulation of Japanese currency and Japanese yen in Central and South China, and military needs. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Britain decided to continue providing financial loans to China to stabilize China's currency system, the general elements in Japan who have always advocated reconciliation with Britain and the United States were greatly disappointed. The "Financial Institutions Newspaper" published an article today, believing that London and Chongqing have united to oppose Japan's financial plans in North China. The newspaper demanded that the Japanese government not only take "countermeasures," but also lodge a protest with London. Tokyo political figures pointed out that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita had just given a speech a few days ago, calling on democratic countries to understand "the work of constructing the new Far East." After the announcement of this declaration, Japanese people were hoping that Britain could adopt a more reserved attitude towards the Chinese government, but unexpectedly the British government responded with loans.

<p>(London) A meeting on the China incident was held here today, discussing the war in China from the perspectives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Chairman Sinclair, leader of the Liberal Party, declared that dictatorial countries have a common interest in exploiting China's weakness to aid Japan, another dictatorial country. At the same time, the Soviet Union, the United States, and democratic countries in Western Europe also have a common interest in safeguarding the principles and laws of the Nine-Power Treaty, and in caring for China's culture and prosperity and protecting it from the scourge of war and violence. Labor MP Noel-Baker spoke, urging the implementation of economic sanctions against Japan, and saying that he hoped the British government would cooperate with the United States and France to ban the import of Japanese goods. If this were done, the tragedy of thousands of small white boxes containing the ashes of Japanese soldiers being transported back from China every day could be ended. Former French Resident-General in Annam, Pasquier, declared that as far as Japan is concerned, its "first enemy" is neither China nor the Soviet Union, but Britain, and its "second enemy" is the United States. Rothstein said that the Soviet Union does not deny that it will continue to provide China with military materials and moral support. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e23">British Far East Shipping Threatened by Japan; Shipping Committee Makes Recommendations, Asks Government to Seriously Consider <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(London) The report of the Imperial Shipping Committee has made far-reaching recommendations on the threat to British shipping in the Far East, especially from Japan. It is said that subsidies, currency devaluation, and lower living standards are all factors that make Japanese ships' expenses much lower than those of British ships. It is now urgent to strengthen the shipping industry and allow it to operate between Australia and Japan and between India and Japan. These ships will be of great help in maintaining the commerce of Australia and India in the event of war. The British government must give this issue serious consideration. British ships should cooperate more closely to form a united front. All relevant governments may also need to consider providing some financial assistance to these ships' operating expenses. Japanese Eastern shipping through the Panama Canal has increased to account for two-fifths of the total, while British shipping has fallen from one-third of the total to one-fifth, and American shipping has also fallen from one-third to one-eighth. The reason for the gradual increase in Japanese merchant ships is that Japan's trade with various countries is becoming more and more prosperous, and because the Japanese government has taken special plans to assist the shipping industry, regarding it as a way to promote new trade. In 1936, the expenses of Japanese ships were 10 to 15 percent lower than those of British ships. British ships now urgently need to improve their equipment in order to compete effectively with foreign passenger ships, and management should also be greatly changed. Eastern representatives should increase their powers. The report also stated that all the matters involved are related to naval and economic defense in both peacetime and wartime. The importance of the Eastern market to merchant ships is like the importance of Singapore to naval air squadrons. The development and prosperity of the British commercial banks in the Far East depend on the ability of British merchant ships to engage in trade in the Far East. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Slovak Separatist Movement: Serious Situation in Czechoslovakia; Czech President Uses Harsh Tactics to Reorganize Slovak Provincial Government <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Prague: After adopting harsh measures to quell the separatist conspiracy within the Slovak community, the Czech government has now taken control of the overall situation in the autonomous province of Slovakia tonight. Ševčík, the former representative sent to Rome to attend the coronation of the new Pope, has been recalled to serve as the Prime Minister of Slovakia in place of Tiso. It is reported that Tiso opposed the dismissal and has appealed to German leader Hitler. After the Hlinka Guard was disbanded, some of its members have been detained, and the rest have been sent to Moravia. Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, is now calm after a brief disturbance this morning. Its railway stations are guarded by military police. Newspapers have been temporarily suspended, and military authorities have banned the public from listening to foreign radio broadcasts. The conflict between Slovakia and the Czech Republic has lasted for a long time, and it is difficult to predict when it can be resolved. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Prague: President Hácha's order to reorganize the autonomous government of the Slovak province seemed to be a sudden move, but in reality, the central government had been making arrangements in secret. When Tiso, the Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior of the autonomous government, under the instigation of Sano Mach, the former director of the Propaganda Department, was preparing to declare the province an independent and free state, he resolutely used this "coup" method to strike first. Initially, the central government felt that the attitude of the autonomous government of the province was ambiguous and had submitted a written request to it, demanding a solemn declaration of willingness to unite spiritually with the Czech community. Unexpectedly, the autonomous government refused to comply and took the opportunity to put forward various ambiguous demands in order to delay the matter. The central government, knowing that the situation was critical, decided to impose strict restrictions. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) A diplomatic observer here stated that the Slovak rebellion against the Czech federal government failed yesterday, and we can see from this that countries with a complex mix of nationalities have not been stable since being divided by Munich. The undercurrent of this rebellion is quite elusive to European politicians, because experts generally do not believe that this rebellion is purely a spontaneous movement. It is undeniable that the Slovak community does not approve of the federal government, and it is also undeniable that Germany, Poland, Italy, and Hungary are all genuinely concerned about the division and disintegration of the existing elements of the Czech organization. However, although Germany has condemned Czech President Hácha's harsh tactics of eliminating the Slovak rebel party, we cannot arbitrarily conclude that Germany must be the backer of the rebel party. It is now noteworthy that Tiso, the former Slovak Prime Minister who was dismissed by the Czech government, has appealed to the German government for assistance in the Slovak independence movement. How will Germany respond? This is what the world wants to know. Recently, the Czech Republic has not been as obedient to Berlin as it was before, but what can Germany hope to gain from Slovakia's secession from the Czech Republic? This is difficult to predict at present. It is possible that the resolution of the Slovak movement is somewhat related to the unresolved fate of Ruthenia, which Hungary and Poland are willing to divide between themselves under Italian protection.

<p>Prague: Official circles here now hold a kind of hope that a compromise can be reached according to the constitution to resolve the turmoil within the Czech Republic caused by the changes of the radical elements in Slovakia. The radical faction in Slovakia aims to declare Slovakia an independent country and break away from the Czech Republic. The Czech government today adopted a moderate plan, agreeing to establish a new Slovak government that truly represents the Slovak community, acting according to the procedures of the late Slovak Autonomy Party leader Hlinka. This promise has been broadcast by Czech Deputy Prime Minister Sidor. Sidor claimed that the list of new members of the Slovak cabinet has been submitted to the Czech President by the executive committee of the Slovak Parliament, together with former Prime Minister Tiso. The Czech cabinet is scheduled to meet this morning to discuss the new members of the Slovak cabinet, and it is expected that this list will definitely be accepted by the Czech cabinet. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Leipzig: Although the general mood here is extremely tense, the situation may turn sharply downward and a compromise is possible. It is said that Tiso, the dismissed Slovak Prime Minister, is still personally participating in the talks to form a new cabinet. It was reported this morning that an agreement has been reached in these talks, but the list has not yet been released as of 10:00 AM. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) According to semi-official news, the Slovak government led by former Prime Minister Tiso has sent a note to Germany. At the same time, Slovak cabinet member Ďurčanský (also dismissed by the Czech President) and German minority leader Karmasin have arrived in Vienna, carrying a special mission from Tiso to visit Hitler in Berlin. Before his departure, Ďurčanský issued a radio broadcast, denouncing the current members of the Slovak government as traitors to Slovakia, and saying that from a constitutional standpoint, the Czech Republic has no reason to interfere in Slovak affairs. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the Czech central government suddenly reorganized the autonomous government of the Slovak province, all the majority of cabinet members who sympathized with former Prime Minister Tiso, such as cabinet member without portfolio Karmasin and Labor Minister Ďurčanský, have fled into German territory and requested assistance from the German government. Well-informed sources here recently declared that Germany is very concerned about the Czech central government's attitude. According to the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration, the Czech Republic promised to make various concessions to the various minority groups. In other words, the Czech Republic not only granted the right to national self-determination to the German people, but also promised to grant the same right to the Slovak, Ukrainian, and Hungarian minority groups. However, in terms of this action, it seems that it wants to go back on its word. According to the local newspaper, the autonomous government of the Slovak province has sent a note to the German government, the contents of which are not known. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Prague: Well-informed sources recently stated that after the central government took strict military measures within the province of Slovakia, the situation throughout the province was quite peaceful. The Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Mr. Sokol, arrived here this morning and immediately met with President Hacha and Prime Minister Beran of the central government cabinet for talks. The cabinet advisor and Minister of Slovak Affairs was also present. Afterwards, Sokol immediately returned to the capital of Slovakia to explain the central government's intentions to key political figures, and it is uncertain whether he will return here. The ambassadors of Germany, Italy, and Poland all visited Foreign Minister Chvalkovský in the afternoon to inquire about the current situation. The Foreign Minister immediately informed them that the measures taken by the central government were purely internal and would not affect national policy. The general public here is paying close attention to the attitudes of various countries. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Prague: This morning, it was learned here that the Czech central government held a cabinet meeting last night to discuss the Slovakian situation. It is unknown whether a course of action has been decided. News from Bratislava this morning stated that, apart from clashes between the Hlinka Guard and Czech troops, the situation was peaceful last night. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Capital of Slovakia Province: After the central government ordered the dissolution of the provincial autonomous government, several demonstrations immediately broke out here. However, the central government had taken military measures in advance to prevent this, so order was maintained. Extremist members of the Autonomy Party occupied the party headquarters and exchanged gunfire with Czech military police, injuring several people on both sides. Demonstrators also attempted to march in formation but were dispersed by the military. Another group of over three thousand demonstrators held a rally in the central square of the city, where German propagandist Fuhsnehdort delivered a speech, vehemently criticizing the Czech people. By 9:00 p.m., all cafes and public places were ordered by the police authorities to close. The "People's Daily" stated that the leaders of the extremist faction of the Autonomy Party, Sano Mach and Bela Tuka, originally planned to launch a rebellion on the 6th of this month, first declaring independence and then merging with Hungary. However, due to a lack of support, they abandoned the plan. The autonomous status of Slovakia province is still expected to be recognized by the central government. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Bratislava, Slovakia Province: Order has been completely restored here. The new autonomous government of Slovakia Province appointed by the central government has not yet taken office. It is said that the Slovak people insist that the former Prime Minister, Tiso, must continue to be part of the cabinet. (Note: Tiso has been taken by the central military authorities to a monastery in the suburbs and placed under house arrest.) It is reported that the speaker of the Provincial Assembly, Sokol, has gone to Prague today to hold talks with the central authorities. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Regarding the Czech central government's reorganization of the autonomous government of Slovakia Province, after receiving an important report from the German Embassy in the Czech Republic yesterday, Chancellor Hitler immediately summoned Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in the afternoon and convened several private advisors this morning to discuss the matter. Commentators believe that the German government may intervene forcefully and is unwilling to recognize the new provincial government appointed by the Czech central government. In short, the Czech political turmoil must be resolved quickly, regardless of the method used. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the conflict between the Czech and Slovak peoples, German officials have expressed sympathy for the Slovak people, saying that they "are fighting for independence." Well-informed sources say that the declaration made by former Slovak Prime Minister Tiso was issued on behalf of the German semi-official news agency, the German News Agency." The German government's support for the Slovak people is evident. Germany and Italy have not yet provided guarantees for the Czech border. Now that political turmoil has occurred in the Czech Republic, there may be an exchange of views. The "People's Observation Report" stated that "the Czech government authorities are using terrorist tactics against the Slovak people." The "German General Report" characterized Czech President Hacha's reorganization of the Slovak Autonomous Provincial Government as a "violation of the constitution." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Paris) After the Czech central government ordered the reorganization of the Slovak autonomous provincial government, the British side is concerned about the situation in the province. They are worried that the momentum of Germany's "eastward expansion" policy has not diminished. They say that Germany has at least facilitated Slovakia's resistance to the central government, such as encouraging separatist movements in the province. The fact that two Slovak provincial government ministers visited Berlin, and that the German Vienna radio station broadcasts anti-Czech programs in Slovak are all sufficient to prove that Germany has certain influence in Slovakia province. It is commendable that the Czech central government was able to deal with it resolutely this time. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>London: Diplomatic circles here are closely monitoring the situation in the Czech Republic and believe that the Czech central government, in light of the separatist movements advocated by the Slovak and Ukrainian minority groups, is doing everything possible to maintain unity and has no other motives. The origins of this incident seem to lie in the visit of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu to Poland. During his talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, Foreign Minister Gafencu no longer expressed opposition to the connection of Polish and Hungarian territories. Upon hearing the news, the Slovak separatists were greatly excited. This separatist movement, which would facilitate the realization of Polish-Hungarian understanding, is naturally supported by Hungary, but the German government does not want to see it materialize. As of now, although German newspapers have supported the Slovak people and criticized the Czech central government, their true intentions remain questionable. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

Political figures say that the Czech central government's handling of this matter was not entirely appropriate and that further disturbances may arise. Poland may be directly affected, as Poland has ethnic ties with Slovakia, and there are no disagreements between them. This opinion expresses the Polish people's sympathy for Slovak demands.

<p>Warsaw: Newspapers here mostly say that the seriousness of this Czech incident is comparable to the Czech-German conflict of last September. Well-informed sources say that the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration Award (the arbitration award on the demarcation between the Czech and Hungarian territories) have not completely resolved the Czech crisis. There are still many difficulties among the Czech, Slovak, and Ukrainian peoples in the country. Political instability in the Czech Republic is directly related to Polish interests and cannot be ignored. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) U.S. Naval Chief of Staff Leahy today criticized Japanese newspapers for reporting that Japan is determined to build a powerful navy equal to any country in the world. He stated that the United States is determined to maintain a five-to-three advantage over Japan.

<p>(London) British Home Secretary Hoare recently delivered a speech at the Chelsea Constituency Conservative Party branch, expressing extreme optimism about the future of the international situation. His words were roughly as follows: "We now assume that the peoples of European countries have politically regained an optimistic view and jointly formulate a five-year plan, the greatness of which can exceed any five-year plan. During these five years, there will be no wars or rumors, and the people of European countries will not have to bear military expenditures, nor will they be surrounded by nightmares. If this can be achieved, then all modern magical inventions can be used to create a golden age, reduce poverty to a minimum, and raise living standards to unprecedented levels. I sincerely hope that the world's major politicians will not miss this great opportunity. There are now five great politicians in Europe, including three dictators (referring to the dictators of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union), as well as the Prime Ministers of Britain and France. If they can work together with one heart and soul, and with the support of the President of the United States, they can thoroughly transform world history in a very short period of time and become permanent benefactors of mankind. Is this not wonderful? Our Prime Minister has already expressed his determination to work tirelessly and spare no effort.

<p>(London) Tonight's commentaries all mention the optimism expressed by political interviewers this morning regarding the European situation and the possibility of disarmament negotiations. The "Evening Standard" said that the recovery of the stock exchange and the sudden breakthrough of haze and optimism are not without reason, and are based on various facts. Some say that Britain will launch a new disarmament conference, but this statement is doubtful. Britain has previously led by example in disarmament, hoping to pacify the world, but ultimately failed. Therefore, a new initiative to stop the arms race should now be undertaken by other countries. Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that London now has the impression that the Spanish war cannot be delayed any longer, which is an important element in European appeasement. The recent easing of the situation may be a precursor to finding a way for France and Italy to hold discussions on their disputes before the situation develops disturbingly. As for seeking universal disarmament, it is still the goal of the British government. Londoners do not tend to attach excessive importance to Italy's informal demands on France. The opinions expressed by the diplomatic interviewers of various newspapers believe that future discussions may focus on the Djibouti issue and the status of Italian expatriates in Tunis, and there are no absolute difficulties in these two points. Most people believe this is the case. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) The Japanese military authorities in Guangzhou have begun house-to-house searches in various suspicious locations due to the increasing number of crimes in the city. A section of the area between the Iron Bridge of the British Concession of Shamian and Huangsha Station was cut off by the Japanese military and thoroughly searched. In addition to a detailed inspection of each house, the residents were also rigorously interrogated. The results are currently unknown. Only a few Chinese with their hands tied behind their backs were seen being taken away by the Japanese military. The Japanese side encountered a serious obstacle in this operation, as there is currently a shortage of rice in the city, causing great hardship for the poor. For the past few days, new rice from the countryside has not been transported to Guangzhou for some unknown reason, causing rice prices to soar and most citizens unable to afford it. The Guangzhou "Chinese" and Japanese authorities are now doing their best to remedy this serious situation. The first step is to order a ban on the export of rice. It is reported that the Japanese search of houses has caused various rumors, such as the assassination of a Chinese official of the puppet city government, the wounding of a Japanese sentinel, and the assassination of a Chinese police officer. The Japanese military police authorities have strongly denied the above rumors and are now investigating the source of these rumors. A mass meeting was held in the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall a few days ago. During the speeches, several people called on members of various trade associations and shop owners to resume business immediately. After the meeting, they marched in procession through various thoroughfares. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Haizhou Correspondence: Haizhou is located in the center of the Longhai Railway, at the intersection of the Yellow Sea and the Rose River, with a strategically important location. It is famous for its salt production. Lianyungang, the terminal of the Longhai Railway, is an important military port. On the morning of the 5th, the Japanese army units of Yamamoto, Nakajima, and Sawada invaded Haizhou in five routes. Han Deqin, Commander-in-Chief of the Subei Guerrilla Forces, personally led the units of Miao Chengliu and Yu Bizhong, and three regiments of the Self-Defense Corps, to bravely resist. They once broke through the North Gate, and the battle was fierce and unprecedented. The residents of Haizhou had already been evacuated. The tracks and sleepers near Haizhou on the Longhai Railway were completely dismantled, and the road surface was thoroughly destroyed. The strong bunkers, bridges, and warehouses along the Rose River built by the Chinese army were terribly bombed. On the 6th, the Japanese army units of Horii and Hisano detoured from Huaiyin and attacked the outskirts of Haizhou. The Yamaguchi Japanese Air Force Brigade bombed the Chinese army positions and the Longhai Line. Warships and gunboats constantly approached from the sea. Chairman Han, who had fought for a long time, had to withdraw from Haizhou in tears, sadly bidding farewell to the second line of national defense of the Longhai Railway. The vanguard of the Japanese army, the units of Ikuta and Katano, first entered the Dongdou Renchang. Xin Liya, the principal of Haizhou Elementary School, organized a puppet maintenance association.</p>

<p>Text of Two Provisional Motions</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Third National Education Conference passed two provisional motions. The first was "Accepting Chairman Chiang's instructions at this conference as the highest guiding principle for our country's education in the future." The second was "Matters that should receive special attention in education during the great era of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction." The former establishes the fundamental principles of education, while the latter specifies the concrete guidelines for education. These are significant developments for our country's education in the future. The texts of the two motions are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Accepting Chairman Chiang's instructions at this conference as the highest guiding principle for our country's education in the future.</p>
<p>At the third plenary session of this conference, Chairman Chiang personally delivered instructions with foresight and earnest advice. The points he indicated are truly golden rules for current education. This conference should unanimously accept them as the highest guiding principles for our country's education in the future, and vigorously promote and implement their implementation plan. The Ministry of Education is requested to formulate and issue orders separately for implementation.</p>
<p>(2) Matters that should receive special attention in education during the great era of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.</p>
<p>(Explanation) The principles of education do not change due to wartime. To fulfill the mission of resisting the war on one hand and building the nation on the other, the only way is to use a normal attitude on basic facilities, so that the teachers strive to teach and the students strive to learn, there is no other simple way to be effective. But in this unprecedentedly difficult war of resistance, the ability of young people to adapt to the environment is more needed than before the war, especially thinking about how to remedy the sores and phlegm after the war, and how to support and nurture the vitality, the responsibility for the second generation of nationals is more serious. To cultivate the ability of future young people to shoulder the constant arduousness, without the education authorities taking responsibility now, there is no other hope. Our central and local educational administrative organs, educational institutions and educational groups have already made many practical contributions to this demand, and now it is appropriate to promote it more actively, and the authorities should consider the implementation method according to the local situation and put it into effect on some recognized important matters. (A) Educational institutions, (1) Educational circles across the country, whether teachers, scholars, young people, old people, should all be inspired, brave and diligent, and earnestly practice the general mobilization outline of the national spirit advocated by the highest leader, anytime and anywhere, the life of being drunk and dreaming of death must be corrected, the vigorous spirit must be increased, the habit of perfunctory survival must be eliminated, the selfish plan must be broken, and the divergent and complicated thoughts must be corrected. (2) In addition to the regular classes, each school may set up wartime lectures or current affairs discussion groups, etc., depending on the ability of the students, collect books, newspapers and magazines about the war of resistance, and the school authorities should invite teachers from the school or experts from outside the school or those with considerable experience to lecture or lead the discussion. In addition to war news, the content should pay special attention to the enemy's situation and the international situation. (3) Students who have reached a considerable age may, according to their academic ability, engage in various direct and indirect work beneficial to the War of Resistance in their spare time and holidays, depending on local needs, such as war zone services, rear services, conscription propaganda, and general propaganda, etc. In areas in the rear that have been attacked by enemy aircraft, attention should also be paid to rescue work. The above work must be led by the faculty and staff of each school to carry out orderly and organized actions to cultivate their good habits. (4) In order to engage in the above work, special training on various knowledge and skills should be given outside of the regular classes. (5) The curriculum of each department should collect important information directly and indirectly related to the War of Resistance as supplementary teaching materials. (6) If students are willing to receive special and strict military training in the school as basic preparations for junior officers and air force personnel, if their age and physical strength are qualified, each school should try to provide them with the opportunity to receive this education within the possible scope. (B) Educational and Youth Administrative Organs, (7) Educational administrative organs at all levels should expand as much as possible and accelerate the implementation of special wartime education aimed at the general public, and production education to provide a prosperous national economy. (8) Educational administrative organs at all levels should, according to local needs, conduct war zone service education in addition to formal education. (9) Educational administrative organs at all levels should pay extreme attention to the talents urgently needed in the War of Resistance, expand as much as possible and accelerate the training, and should effectively contact the organs that employ these talents. (10) The Ministry of Education should hire and transfer personnel to form a special organ to be responsible for the research, design and promotion of education in the war zone and the enemy's rear, and the liaison and coordination of various related aspects. (11) The material treatment of educational workers in the war zone and the enemy's rear should be appropriately improved, and at the same time, ways should be found to adjust the material treatment of educational workers in the rear. (12) When the Ministry of Education handles the relief of primary and secondary school teachers in the war zone, special attention should be paid to assigning work directly and indirectly related to the War of Resistance.

<h3 id="e54">Finance: Foreign Exchange Tightens, Cash Gold Rises Very Slightly <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market in the black market was still in a chaotic situation at the beginning of the morning. Because foreign exchange was loose and hard, and cash gold was sold at low prices, the price once dropped to a low of 2,060 yuan. However, there were very few transactions at that time. Later, foreign exchange was fiercely traded by the United Reserve Bank of North China and other banks, causing the potential to turn from loose to tight. As a result, people's hearts were shaken and the trading wind became steeper. Moreover, most retail investors who sold short came back in, and foreign banks were also actively involved behind the scenes. Therefore, the market price rose again, and the transaction supply increased with the time. The noon closing price once reached 2,089 yuan. In the afternoon, because cash gold continued to be sold, it fell back to 2,080 yuan at the closing. The final exchange rate rose by 5 yuan. People's hearts were slightly settled, and the transaction was slightly cleaner than the previous day, about 750 taels. Silver jewelry was listed at 2 yuan higher. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold tended to be stagnant.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Only Rises by 5 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, because the potential of foreign exchange was loose, most of those who entered were temporarily skeptical, so the selling price was shouted down from 2,080 yuan to 70 yuan before trading started. First, a silver shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange for 2,070 yuan, which was the opening price, 5 yuan lower than the previous closing. After the opening, a certain cash gold shop was very eager to sell, and did not hesitate to sell at a low price, so the price fell by 10 yuan. The cash gold shop sold 50 taels to a securities company for 60 yuan, which was the lowest price. At that time, foreign exchange stopped loosening and turned tight, and the downward trend intensified, and the price immediately rebounded. There were more buyers, and the money exchange entered 50 taels of silver shop at 63 yuan, and another money exchange also entered 50 taels of securities company at 68 yuan. After that, a certain cash gold shop continued to sell, so it fell back. A certain money exchange absorbed 50 taels of cash gold shop on behalf of a foreign bank at 65 yuan. Later, another money exchange also entered 50 taels of silver shop at 64 yuan. After a certain silver shop sold short, it soon bought back 50 taels of cash gold shop at the original price. After that, the cash gold shop stopped selling and watched, and there were very few sellers, and the step-up was very severe. The gold shop entered 50 taels of silver shop at 70 yuan. A certain money exchange absorbed 50 taels of silver shop on behalf of a foreign bank, priced at 74 yuan, and then entered 50 taels of gold shop priced at 80 yuan. Later, the money exchange mutually traded 50 taels at 85 yuan, and then mutually traded 50 taels at 89 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because there was no market for foreign exchange on Saturdays, the transaction was sparse. Only because the cash gold shop continued to sell, it tended to be weak. First, the cash gold shop sold 50 taels to the money exchange at 86 yuan. After that, there was a greater lack of entrants, and the cash gold shop sold another 50 taels to the money exchange, and it fell to 80 yuan. Before long, the same money exchange mutually traded 50 taels at the same price. After that, supply and demand became even scarcer, and the price was stagnant. By the time after 4:00 pm, it was still not open, so the evening closing price was 2,080 yuan, which was 5 yuan higher than the previous day. The difference between the whole day was 29 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand gold was 2,090 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,075 yuan. The current standard gold is listed at 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are no transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Jumps Up by 2 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning, the exchange of jewelry gold per tael did not change, but at 11:35 AM, because the potential of spot gold turned strong, it was also listed at 2 yuan higher. Datonghang changed to hang 212 yuan, Xinhanghang 210 yuan, and purchased at 204 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Pure Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The London electricity on the 10th reported that British pure gold was stagnant again, and the price was still 7 pounds, 8 shillings and 3 pence per ounce. The People's Bank of China's cash purchase price was also stagnant at 1,210 yuan and 0.03 yuan. The listed customs gold has not changed, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price has also not changed, remaining at 1,205 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Rising Foreign Currencies <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 0.125. The supply of foreign exchange in this port initially eased, with ample supply from foreign telegraphic transfers. Foreign firms were eager to settle accounts, but banks' absorption capacity was not strong, leading to a period of strong prices. In the afternoon, demand from foreign firms increased, with yarn and cloth merchants actively purchasing. However, banks were not eager to sell, leading to a soft market. Ultimately, the supply of British and American exchange became slightly tight, causing confusion and uncertainty among speculators. Major players remained on the sidelines, while small investors quickly entered and exited the market, resulting in unstable prices. Initially, prices eased along with the availability of drafts, allowing small investors to realize some profits. Later, news of tighter drafts revived the interest of wealthy individuals in taking long positions, using gold shops and currency exchange businesses to buy. Tianjin merchants also began to acquire, with most market participants expecting higher prices, partly due to the higher gold prices in Tianjin, which made arbitrage profitable, and partly because wealthy individuals who had bought at higher prices previously were unwilling to cut their losses and hoped to buy at lower prices. With supply remaining weak, prices rose slightly. Wealthy individuals resumed absorbing British and American gold pounds, and demand for various foreign currencies increased, driving market prices higher. Retail transactions were brisk, while exchange transactions were rare, with only Yongtai selling a US dollar draft for 1,000 yuan from Qin Taijin, and Changtai selling French franc drafts for 2,000 from Fuhexiang. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds rise by 50 cents each, British gold drafts by 14 cents, US dollar drafts by 0.75 cents, Hong Kong drafts by 8 cents, French franc drafts by 1.75 cents, Singapore drafts by 2 cents, Canadian drafts by 6 cents, Philippine drafts by 2 cents, Australian gold drafts by 20 cents, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Loan (Continued) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Mujie</p>
<p>(4) The Application of the Sino-British Loan</p>
<p>This Sino-British loan of 5 million pounds is solely intended to serve as an exchange stabilization fund. Therefore, discussing the application of the Sino-British loan is equivalent to discussing the application of the exchange stabilization fund.</p>
<p>An exchange stabilization fund is quite capable of adapting to circumstances in controlling foreign exchange. Since China recognizes that the current foreign exchange control measures are not perfect, the application of this exchange stabilization fund should be able to eliminate these shortcomings. However, there are also limitations in the application process: (1) If exchange rate fluctuations are due to fundamental reasons such as price levels and international balance of payments, the function of the application is relatively narrow; but if it is based on temporary, unnatural reasons such as exchange speculation and capital flight, it can exert a great function. (2) It can exert a supreme function when the domestic financial market does not promote expansion or contraction, but only maintains stability; however, if it is accompanied by expansion or contraction, the results of the application must be pre-emptively guarded against. However, within the possible range, it can still adapt to exchange rate fluctuations and the needs of the domestic economy, and exert its subtle effect in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Currently, China is implementing strict foreign exchange control and trade management, making it not difficult to achieve a balance in international payments, and the domestic financial market is also based on maintaining stability as a principle. Therefore, there is no doubt that the application of this loan will be able to exert a great function. Moreover, the establishment of the exchange fund originally originated in Britain. Now that China's exchange stabilization fund is established in London and operated in the same way as the British exchange stabilization fund, its future success is certain. According to diplomatic correspondents in the daily telegrams, technical arrangements have now been made. According to this arrangement, it is expected that this amount—referring to 5 million pounds—can very well consolidate China's monetary system and resist the destructive methods currently implemented by Japan. The results of the application are conceivable.</p>
<p>(5) The Sino-British Loan and the Future of the Foreign Exchange Black Market</p>
<p>Since March 14 of last year, China's Ministry of Finance has implemented import foreign exchange controls to seek a balance in international trade and to control the escape of domestic funds by limiting the sale of foreign exchange. Later, it implemented export foreign exchange controls to promote the export of local products in order to collect foreign currency to replenish the foreign exchange fund. Although this policy has been quite successful, the legal exchange rate of the fiat currency has remained stable. However, the exchange rate in the black market has been declining in a straight line from March to July, and only after July did it begin to stabilize at the level of eight pence. However, when people were panicking, there were even views that it would fall to six pence. Why did it stabilize at the eight-pence level? Japanese observers say that it was maintained through cooperation between the Chinese government and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. In fact, anyone who pays attention to foreign exchange news knows that when the black market is tight, Hong Kong sends telegrams to sell, and when it is loose, it sends telegrams to buy. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation also adopts the same steps. The Japanese observation is not without reason.</p>
<p>Now that China has borrowed 5 million pounds to establish an exchange stabilization fund of 10 million pounds, it is naturally a great threat to the black market. Consider the following market prices:</p>
<p>However, whether it is possible for the black market to lengthen to the point where it is equal to the official price is still a question. The Japanese collecting fiat currency to obtain foreign exchange, the continued trade deficit in Shanghai, and other environmental restrictions still leave room for the existence of the black market. Because all of these are factors that allow the black market to exist, as evidenced by the fact that the black market has remained pegged at eight pence since July of last year. Therefore, the future of the foreign exchange black market is that the exchange rate will never fall again, but will have a tendency to lengthen, but will never be equal to the official price. Recently, Tianjin yarn and cloth merchants have been selling off in large quantities, while the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has been absorbing in large quantities. This situation can also prove the same point. Reuters电传宋子良谈话, [Reuters reported on the 9th with a telegram citing Song Zi Liang]: The currency steps taken by China last year have been proven correct by experience. Although the successive falls of Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Hankou triggered speculative actions, the foreign exchange market has remained firm. The Bank of China was even able to repurchase all of the foreign exchange used to support the fiat currency in any serious military setback during the quiet market. A detailed analysis of this statement makes it easy to understand the relationship and impact of the Sino-British exchange fund loan on the foreign exchange black market!</p>
<p>So, can the Sino-British exchange stabilization fund loan eliminate the black market exchange rate? Then, the enemy of the black market exchange rate is the time factor. As China approaches final victory day by day, the exchange stabilization fund will exert its function day by day, and the black market exchange rate will lengthen to the official price day by day.</p>
<p>(6) The Sino-British and "Japanese Puppet" Economic War</p>
<p>The establishment of this Sino-British loan comes at a time when the Japanese puppets are scheduled to ban the circulation of Chinese fiat currency in North China on March 10 and implement foreign exchange controls, and when China is holding a local financial conference in Chongqing to focus on discussing how to purchase important materials and raw materials to prevent them from being used by the "Japanese puppets," and how to use provincial banknotes to penetrate and circulate in guerrilla areas to resist the circulation of "Japanese puppet" paper money. It is clearly an economic retaliatory act against Japan's attempt to devalue the fiat currency and exclude foreign interests in North China, and China's domestic arrangements for using this loan. Therefore, comparing this loan matter and the financial conference with the "Japanese puppet" measures in North China on March 10, it is known that it is an economic war between the Sino-British and the "Japanese puppets." Because China wants to maintain the stability of currency and finance in wartime, and Britain wants to maintain China's interests, free from Japanese suppression and infringement, they can only unite and counter the "Japanese puppets" with joint economic actions, to break its ambitious attempts. The joint establishment of the exchange stabilization fund by the Sino-British is one such joint economic action. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e57">North China Again Comes with a Fierce Settlement; Foreign Exchange Returns to Tight Situation; Yarn and Cloth Merchants Once Had Dumping <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market initially saw a surge in supply from foreign banks. Although foreign firms were settling accounts at that time, the market felt that the position was still ample, so the underlying trend was once slightly hard. Afterwards, due to the sudden and fierce purchases by speculators in North China and the "Joint Reserve Bank of North China," the situation changed from loose to tight. As a result, it softened slightly. However, yarn and cloth merchants came to dump in the middle, but it had no impact. Half-day trading was still brisk. The Hong Kong exchange rate also tended to tighten slightly due to the strong purchasing by Chinese banks.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large bills, near-term returned to grow by 1.125, long-term continued to grow by 0.0625, New York's silver price remained stagnant, and London's raw gold also had no rise or fall. The exchange rate between British and American currencies was higher by three haos, higher against France by three shengdings, higher against Shanghai by 0.0625, American against British was higher by 1.125, higher against France by 0.0625, higher against Shanghai by 1 jiao, and the central government's quotations remained the same. The bank's selling price for British exchange was 8 bans 34375, and for American exchange was 16 yuan 3125, which was tighter by 0.015625 for British and softer by 0.03125 for American compared to the previous close. After the opening, although the major foreign firms were purchasing, it was not as if the foreign banks' supply was ample, so the situation turned out to be loose and hard. Foreign firms settled accounts, Holland, Macalister, and a certain bank bought British exchange at 8 bans 375 and American exchange at 16 yuan 375. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's quotations were announced to remain unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be large at 7.5%, calculated at 8.50%. Afterwards, although Chinese merchants and yarn and cloth merchants came to dump, the underlying trend turned from loose to tight due to the sudden and fierce purchases by speculators in North China and the "Joint Reserve Bank of North China." There was an advantage in absorbing the American exchange from the yarn and cloth merchants, which narrowed from 16 yuan 375 to 3125. At that time, foreign banks supplied Hong Kong exchange to Chinese merchants at 56 yuan 125, and the situation also tended to tighten slightly. Near noon, foreign firms again purchased and settled accounts, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's British exchange at 8 bans 34375, and the situation turned flat. At the noon close, the bank's selling price for British exchange was 8 bans 34375, and for American exchange was 16 yuan 3125, which was no different from the morning opening. As a result, compared to the previous close, British was tighter by 0.015625, American was softer by 0.03125, and Hong Kong exchange was also more expensive by 0.125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Securities, Government Bonds Naturally See Decline <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Securities gray market, yesterday's market surprisingly turned around, as this newspaper had expected. However, major players were mostly afraid that it would fall from here, and were watching in the morning. In the afternoon, there was a sudden pull-up to make a final effort. This kind of restricted situation is probably not something that a small number of people can control. Market prices are due to the fact that the situation on the surface is no longer the same, and the selling sentiment is gradually strong. The so-called large loan is actually only 5 million pounds. The rise in recent days has felt excessive, so the situation changes and it is easy to fall. In the afternoon, Class E initially wanted to raise the price to the closing price, but was suppressed by Qiafeng, and the trend and future should be a curved decline. Yesterday's experience, the opening was slightly fatigued and without much change due to the purchase of numbers 4 and 5. Afterwards, number 20 completely withdrew and did nothing, and the sellers such as numbers 7, 11, 13, and 15, as well as Defu Qiafeng Hengfu, all sold, so the market price could not be maintained, and the reaction suddenly rose, falling by one yuan. Then, Dafeng Mao Da and number 49 all made small additions, rising slightly, but already falling by 6 jiao to 9.5 jiao. In the afternoon, number 20 came to pull up again, but only specialized in trading Class E and Class C, and the rest had more sales and fewer entries, so the market price had a deformed situation. The rest, numbers 5 and 15, bought back slightly, but Tongkang Qiafeng and number 72 still sold, so the price increase felt twice the effort. The competition was fiercest at the close, and the result was still that the sellers had the upper hand. The market price finally fell slightly by 1 jiao to 5.5 jiao, Class A fell by 5.5 jiao, and Class E only fell by 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was around one million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded, at a price of 6 yuan and 0.05 fen.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds, the listed market prices on the 10th of this month (Friday), the rising trend has come to a halt, and all bonds have reported stability and no change. Yesterday's transactions, British gold Rehabilitation Public Bonds opened for three transactions, calculated on legal issue unmarked bonds, with the opening price being 48 pounds. German-issued marked bonds opened at a price of 49 pounds, and Russian-issued marked bonds opened at a price of 48.5 pounds. The supply of physical goods in London included British-German continued loans, German-issued marked bonds for 2,000 pounds, with a price of 76 pounds, two pounds less than the British issue listing price. Also on this port side, there were 2,000 pounds of German-issued marked Rehabilitation Public Bonds, sold at a price of 50 pounds, one pound higher than the opening price from the previous day.</p>
<p>London British Far East Company Stocks, the listed market prices on the 10th of this month (Friday), only bank stocks had slight ups and downs. Macalister Bank shares rose slightly by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of 9 pounds 12 shillings and 6 pence. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Hong Kong registered shares fell by one pound, with a price of 90 pounds, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Yarn and Cloth, A Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrives in Port This Morning, American Cotton Industry Proposals Still Have Many Branches <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices, the Smith Cotton Industry Proposal that all parties have been yearning for for a long time, although it was passed by the Agricultural Committee of the Senate yesterday, it was fiercely opposed by the Cotton Farmers' Federation, and has been presented to President Roosevelt, requesting amendments. The purpose of the Smith Proposal is to clear all government loan cotton within five years, and to prevent the excess of new cotton in the future. The Smith Cotton Industry Proposal still has many branches, so the New York cotton market is afraid of changes. Yesterday, New York rose by six or seven pounds at the opening due to short covering, and the later market was very stagnant. India, including forecasts, rose by more than one rupee, and Egypt rose by more than 20 pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate tightened slightly, and the converted legal currency and cotton prices all rose. It is calculated that American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 6 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by 6 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 1 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading, previously because Indian cotton was cheaper, all parties' attention was focused on this. Recently, because the shipping costs between India and China are very tight, most of the orders placed earlier have not been able to arrive on time. (The voyage between India and China can take four weeks.) It is difficult for each factory to have enough cotton in stock for one or two months. However, because the source of this cotton is almost exhausted, even if high prices are paid, it is difficult to purchase satisfactory cotton. Therefore, each factory's vision for purchasing foreign cotton in the future will shift towards American cotton. Yesterday, foreign cotton trading was very quiet. Each cotton shop had a strong intention to purchase Rangoon cotton, but because the local area did not have a good harvest, the asking price was very high. A certain foreign firm in this port telegraphed yesterday to inquire, and the reply was that the price could not be reduced, so there was no transaction. The cotton prices of yesterday are listed below.</p>
<p>The British company Alipore transported more than 6,640 tons of Indian cotton from Mumbai, totaling more than 16,000 pieces (yesterday's report mistakenly calculated more than 28,000 pieces). It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, but according to the company, the ship can enter the port at 8:00 am this morning and dock at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong. There is also more than 1,000 tons of cotton to be transported to Japan. After the cotton transported to Shanghai is unloaded, it will go to Japan to deliver the goods.</p>
<p>The local cotton business is unusually dull and unremarkable. This is because the inventory is thin and the arrival of goods is interrupted, so transactions are increasingly rare. Only Shenxin Factory has recently made some purchases. There were only three transactions yesterday, and the remaining firms did not make any transactions. The arrival of goods at the pier is also rare. Only 181 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived, and there are also reports of Yao cotton arriving in Shanghai, but the amount is unknown. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Actual Sales Stalled; Fine Yarn Declines; Each Falls by 5 Yuan to 7 Yuan <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains weak and sluggish, and the momentum is extending downward. This is because current sales are not rising, customers' appetites are sluggish, people's hearts are weak, and the spot goods of general retail investors who have been issued tickets are particularly fierce in the market. At the same time, speculators, in view of the loose surface, have no intention of activity. However, some are unwilling to open sales at low prices because cotton prices are firm and expensive. The firm and upright fine yarn and thread market is also trending downward, with a sudden drop of 5 yuan to 7 yuan.</p>
<p>The situation of spot yarn, the opening in the early morning, the market is a quiet scene, colleagues gather together, mostly say that the actual transaction does not move, brokers entrustment, are all selling transactions, large amounts, quietly did not move, so the market is still in the middle, the decline is not seen violent. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at a price similar to the previous day, at 398 yuan. Afterwards, with no appetite for customer sales, it softened step by step, and finally fell to 395 yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 392.5 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was due to the weekend relationship, the transaction was clear, and the number of people gathered was rare, and the market price gradually fatigued by one yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 394 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 392 yuan. The factory did not move, the market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 5 yuan compared to the previous day, Tiannv fell by 4 yuan, Te Jin Cheng fell by 4.5 yuan, and 42-count Cat Butterfly fell by 7 yuan. Today's export of cotton yarn is 670 pieces, shipped to Shantou, 20 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 75 pieces shipped to Fuzhou, 240 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 195 pieces shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 1,140 pieces shipped to Haiphong. The amounts bought by each group are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese yarn market is crowded with people, the actual demand is particularly quiet, the market price is flat and fatigued, and the sales are few. The current spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 332 yuan, and it could not be sold in the afternoon. The current spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 324 yuan, and as a result, it has fallen by another one yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Grains, Another Large Batch of White Rice Arrives in Shanghai, Indica Rice is Still Limited to the Price Limit, Guest Xian Rice Price Limit Will Be Raised by Half a Yuan Said Rice Merchants This Time Will Make a Big Profit <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Source of Du Rice, River Bottom No. 5, car-transported buns 1,000 to 2,000 bags, the early market was slack, and the late market returned to tight, which became a fixed pattern. The thick and thin Indica price, except for the River Bottom goods, all arrived at the price limit, and there was no change. In fact, the price limit has been eliminated. Du Yangjian and Zhujian are similar, the changed yuan plus 3 jiao, the market goods opened at 19.5 yuan, and the Yin Yuan goods have been gone for a long time. Yesterday, a ship of Fengjing goods was launched, and it was sold out in an instant, with the price opening at 16.5 yuan. Although the large increase in rice prices this time was affected by the Japanese puppets transporting it out, it was not without its influence. However, Shanghai's rice reserves are abundant, and even if no grain of rice arrives, it should not rise so much. Moreover, the arrival of rice has gradually increased in recent days, but the market price has not loosened, so rice merchants will make a big fortune.</p>
<p>Guest Xian Rice, the guest gang and speculators are competing to handle it, and the number of transactions has increased to about 10,000 bags. The market price is blocked by the price limit of 13.5 yuan, so there is no difference in high rice, and the medium and secondary rice have continued to rise by several fen to nearly 1 jiao. It once returned to flat in the morning, and was then raised again by speculators. However, there is a rumor in the market that the price limit for guest Xian rice will be raised to 14 yuan, but according to news from Kuoye Zhong, it must wait until the joint meeting of the guild on Monday before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Datong ship, also transported 10,447 bags of white rice from Hupu Kou, but Zhongyi Company's Ende ship went to Ningbo, transporting 16,000 bags of white rice.</p>

<p>Flour spot transactions gradually decreased, so the Nanyang gang all complained that the price was expensive. It is found that the recent factory prices are 5 fen higher for the northern and southern oceans, so the customer gang is unwilling to accept it. This street is also demanding a reduction in the factory price because it is particularly high. The factory said that there is not enough spot flour, and there may be a slight change next week, so the number of transactions has decreased from more than 50,000 bags to less than 30,000 bags. The wholesale of Mujie is also only about 7,000 bags. Today, 2,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Fuzhou, and 4,000 bags will be shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The wheat market's factory sales are light. It is heard that within the next week, two ships of foreign wheat can arrive, amounting to 17,711 tons. Local wheat demand is weak, but there are Japanese flour factories raising prices to absorb it, and there have been several high-priced dark deals. As for open transactions in the market, they have stopped again.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Silk Tea, Japanese Silk Falls Again, Shanghai Silk Has a Market But No Transactions <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yokohama silk once again poured down, the spot price fell by 35 yuan, and the forward price fell by 25 yuan, causing the people in Shanghai to be very weak. It is said that the Yokohama authorities restrict the price of silk, so that it returns to the record on January 10, then the price of silk in the East City seems to have a possibility of returning to 900 yuan. The New York silk market, Chinese and Japanese raw silk each returned to a small 4 points, causing silk transactions to remain impossible to expand.</p>
<p>The Shanghai silk market has a market but no transactions. The Shanghai silk price, such as the white factory B character, has not opened a new low price of falling to 1,800 yuan. However, according to the calculation of 2.14 yuan for Shanghai silk in the US market, the purchase price of Shanghai silk in the US has fallen to 1,620 yuan. With such a huge difference, it is of course not easy to negotiate. In short, this time the silk price has fallen back, one is due to the shift in speculation, and the second is due to the increase in the exchange rate, just like when it rose high, it was assisted by the expensive gold and cheap silver.</p>

<p>National cloth due to the Japanese army's re-attack, actual sales are greatly affected, and the exchange rate is lengthening, some of the goods stored by speculators are willing to come out of the cage, so although the factory price is expensive, the market price has a difference of 100 cash in the open and dark markets. Only Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth Wenzhou gang specified to purchase, the selling price still insists on 13 yuan, other fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth hand goods have a loose price of 5 fen to 1 jiao. Zhejiang Gan gang handled 50 packages of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth. Among the bleached and dyed goods, bleached cloth is the most popular to purchase, and nearly 200 boxes of Min Fuzhou gang were continuously transacted. Because the national goods' re-handling registration procedures have just been completed, and 36 factories have been temporarily approved to pack and ship. Yesterday, because the suspension of handling was quite long, the bidding was strong, and 400 boxes of color cloth, color twill, bleached cloth, Shilin cloth, and poplin were transacted, and they will be shipped next week.</p>
<p>East cloth white goods, the market atmosphere is still soft, and the customer road for Zazi cloth and fine twill has no transactions. Only 300 to 500 pieces of blank dye from this street are used as embellishments. The flow of buying and selling short in the market gathers extremely lively in the morning and evening markets, but there are few people doing transactions and many people visiting the market. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, hand goods are overflowing, and low bids are repeatedly seen, while other brands of fine cloth and fine twill can still barely stand.</p>
<p>Today's exports of piece goods include 445 pieces shipped to Shantou, 250 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 30 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 190 pieces shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 415 pieces shipped to Haiphong.</p>

<p>National sugar is turning clear because the go wei is not smooth, and the numbers are transacted. However, according to the telegram from Shantou yesterday, the Jin gang is again handling in large quantities, so green, red, and white sugar have unanimously turned up by half a yuan.

<p>Yesterday, soybeans showed signs of returning to normalcy. Due to the frequent declines in futures prices, the market sentiment became slightly more optimistic. Consequently, the spot market became more active. Chongming sand soybeans, with inquiries from export businesses, saw a price increase of five cents, with over a thousand packages traded. The price ranged from eight yuan, three dimes and five cents to eight yuan and five dimes. Spot Dalian soybeans were delivered at a price of eight yuan, three dimes and four cents per cart. Five carts of April's Dalian soybeans were mutually opened by peers at prices ranging from eight yuan, two dimes and five cents to eight yuan, two dimes and one cent, continuing the downward trend from the previous day. Currently, soybean futures trading is largely driven by speculation. It is rumored that Japanese merchants directly released approximately four hundred carts of physical goods, representing a month's worth of trading in April. However, considering the recent physical sales activities, the future market trend is a matter of concern. According to records, 1,050 packages of soybeans arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday, and 2,000 packages were shipped to Hong Kong today. Additionally, 100 packages of sorghum and 1,800 packages of wheat bran were shipped to Xiamen.</p>

<p>Today is the 14th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Kuomintang. Flags will be flown at half-mast throughout the city for one day. At 8:00 AM, various groups, schools, factories, shops, etc., will independently hold small-scale commemorative meetings, reporting on Premier Sun's lifelong revolutionary career and the efforts that the people should make during the Anti-Japanese War. At 12:00 noon, citizens will stand silently in place to mourn the Premier and the soldiers who died in the front lines fighting against the enemy. All entertainment venues will voluntarily suspend business. Citizens throughout the city will contribute their daily savings to the government. The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters has also scheduled the second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week from today to the 18th. The schedule is as follows: the 12th is Commercial Day, the 13th is Industrial Day, the 14th is Agricultural Day, the 15th is Education Day, the 16th is Cultural Day, the 17th is Youth Day, and the 18th is Women's Day. The full text of the Shanghai City Party Headquarters' message to the people is as follows:</p>
<p>Mourning the Premier Requires Even More Resolute Resistance</p>
<p>Dear compatriots throughout the city, today is the 14th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Father of the Republic of China, and the mentor of the world revolution. As we recall this day fourteen years ago, Premier Sun, on his deathbed, earnestly instructed us with his dying words, "Do not be softened by the enemy," and his final teaching, "Strive for peace to save China." Looking at our beautiful rivers and mountains, almost entirely ravaged by the enemy's iron hooves, and tens of millions of soldiers and compatriots, using their blood and heads, fighting arduously for the nation's permanent survival and international peace and justice, we truly feel infinite grief and boundless excitement. We deeply believe that, amidst the emotions of sorrowfully mourning the Premier's death today, all compatriots in the city will even more resolutely and unanimously call upon the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, to persevere in resisting the war to the end, only then can we win our country's final victory, and only then can we be worthy of the Premier's spirit in heaven.</p>
<p>The Dying Words Not to Be Softened by the Enemy</p>
<p>Premier Sun dedicated forty years to revolution. Based on his lifelong fighting experience, he deeply knew that the enemy's violence was not to be feared, the harshness of the environment was not to be feared, and the inferiority of manpower, financial resources, and material resources was also not to be feared. Only the softening and coercion of one's own spirit by the enemy was to be feared. Before the Xinhai Revolution, how much strength did the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance) have? However, Premier Sun, relying on a small number of steadfast comrades, rose again and again after repeated setbacks, undeterred. The Wuchang Uprising ultimately overthrew the Qing Dynasty's rule of more than 260 years and swept away the autocratic regime of more than 3,000 years. This was not because the revolutionary party's manpower, financial resources, and material resources surpassed the Qing government, but because the revolutionary spirit of Premier Sun and his followers surpassed everything. The Qing government naturally collapsed. The success of the campaigns against Yuan Shikai and the protection of the constitution were also concrete results of the revolutionary spirit overcoming the enemy. At the time of his death, looking back on the past and considering the future, the thing that Premier Sun could not let go of was whether the people of the Republic of China and the members of the Chinese Kuomintang could deeply understand the only magic weapon in this revolutionary movement, the dying words "Do not be softened by the enemy," how profound, penetrating, and far-reaching they were!</p>
<p>The Supreme Leader Carries on the Dying Words and Advances</p>
<p>Fourteen years ago, when Premier Sun died in Beijing, our Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek was leading his troops to suppress the rebels in Guangdong and Guangxi. At a time of successive victories, he suddenly received the news of the revolution's mentor's passing. Filled with grief and indignation, he deeply believed that in order to complete Premier Sun's great revolutionary cause, it was necessary to deeply understand Premier Sun's dying words. In 1926, when the National Revolutionary Army swore to begin the Northern Expedition, the manpower, financial resources, and material resources of the Guangzhou National Government were far inferior to those of the warlord government. However, what was the weapon that Chiang Kai-shek used to overcome the enemy and achieve unification? It was this indomitable and arduous revolutionary spirit. This great revolutionary spirit was forged by the dying words "Do not be softened by the enemy." Upholding Premier Sun's great dying words, he was ultimately invincible and achieved success.</p>
<p>Crush the Enemy's Conspiracy to Coerce Our Spirit</p>
<p>This time, Japanese imperialism has frantically launched a war of aggression, attempting to realize its ambition of destroying China and conquering the world. Our Chairman Chiang leads the people of the whole country to rise up and resist the war. In the past twenty months, we have not only shattered the enemy's dream of a "quick victory" but also thwarted the enemy's conspiracy of a "quick peace settlement." The enemy's military strength, financial resources, and material resources are all superior to ours. How can we make the enemy fall into the quagmire and be unable to extricate themselves? The reason for this weakening of the strong and turning defeat into victory is that Chairman Chiang infused Premier Sun's revolutionary spirit into the hearts of soldiers and civilians throughout the country, using the steel-like will and fiery spirit of the whole country to deal with the enemy. The violent enemy naturally falls into a state of defeat. Today, the enemy's strategic and political plans have all failed, and our country's final victory is becoming increasingly imminent. At this time of strategic disorientation, the only way for Japanese imperialism to struggle is to attempt to soften our spirit of resistance and coerce our will to build the country through revolution. The absurd terms such as "building a new order in East Asia," "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere," and "Japan, Manchuria, and China are inseparable" are concrete manifestations of the intention to poison our spirit. Here we can see even more clearly the high and great vision of Premier Sun, which can be passed down for centuries, while the enemy's efforts are increasingly futile and their skills are exhausted.</p>
<p>Promote Our Premier's Revolutionary Spirit</p>
<p>Therefore, today, as we commemorate the death of Premier Sun with infinite emotion, we should even more promote Premier Sun's revolutionary spirit of not softening, not compromising, and not yielding, and fight against the violent enemy to the end. The resistance war cannot be stopped even for a single day until the enemy withdraws from Chinese territory. Since Shanghai fell into an isolated island, the revolutionary spirit of the compatriots throughout the city has been further promoted, and the revolutionary enthusiasm for loving the motherland has been increasing day by day. In order to enable compatriots from all walks of life, including agriculture, industry, commerce, students, youth, and women, to more deeply understand Premier Sun's revolutionary spirit of not compromising and not yielding, and to crush the enemy's conspiracy and trick to soften and coerce our spirit, we are holding the second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week from today, the anniversary of Premier Sun's death, to the 18th. We hope that compatriots from all walks of life will deeply understand that the enemy is bound to be defeated and we are bound to win, further strengthen the work of supporting the resistance against the enemy, and serve as an example for the people of the whole country. Only in this way can we be worthy of being Premier Sun's followers, and only in this way can we complete Premier Sun's unfinished great cause of "striving for peace to save China." The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week, Commercial Day Today, Various Commercial Organizations Call on Compatriots in the Commercial Sector to Encourage the Promotion of Domestic Goods and the Development of the Interior <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai commercial organizations sent a letter to the commercial compatriots in the city, saying, "Fellow commercial compatriots of the city, today is the Commercial Day of the second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week in Shanghai. Since the withdrawal of the national army to the west, the commercial compatriots of the city have not only stood at their own posts and worked hard to promote domestic goods, but have also taken the lead in advocating and sparing no effort in movements such as donating money to the government and providing relief to refugees. This is something we can be somewhat gratified about to the compatriots of the whole country. However, with the post-resistance war already beginning today, on the one hand, our country's final victory is becoming more and more imminent, while at the same time, the arduousness and greatness of its tasks far outweigh the earlier stages. It goes without saying that the compatriots of the whole country need to strengthen their struggle and strive to move forward. Although Shanghai has fallen, Shanghai's position in the whole of China and in the eyes of the world still remains a very important part. The responsibility that our Shanghai commercial sector should bear is becoming even greater. Here are two things that we hope all commercial compatriots in the city will encourage each other to do:</p>
<p>First, we should further strengthen the promotion of domestic goods. Modern warfare is a war of national strength versus national strength, and the economy occupies the most important position in national strength. Everyone knows that the enemy's financial and economic exhaustion and distress have been brought on by launching a war of aggression. The only way to survive at present is to raise funds locally, exploit our people with violence, and dump crudely made and repackaged goods into our country, intending to dominate our market. Shanghai is the main base for the dumping of enemy goods. Regarding the former, the enemy has run into obstacles everywhere due to the expansion of our widespread guerrilla warfare and has failed to realize its conspiracy. Regarding the latter, the enemy is now putting all its efforts into this, arbitrarily reducing tariffs and dominating the Yangtze River shipping, not only excluding our country's domestic goods, but also attempting to deal a fatal blow to the goods of European and American countries. Our commercial compatriots are in this crisis and should be extra vigilant about the insidious nature of the environment and further strengthen our work of promoting domestic goods. It goes without saying that our city's compatriots are happy to use domestic goods. The key is how the commercial sector can make compatriots clearly distinguish between domestic goods and enemy goods. If we can widely promote and sell domestic goods, then the enemy's dumping policy will inevitably fail because our compatriots refuse to buy them.</p>
<p>Second, the city's industrial and financial sectors should work hard to develop the resources of the Northwest and Southwest. Our country is full of resources, especially abundant in the Northwest and Southwest. In the past, the industrial and financial sectors often concentrated their funds in cities and did not focus on the big picture from afar. Now that the national policy of long-term resistance war has been believed in and supported by the people of the whole country, then the work of developing the Northwest and Southwest is the inescapable responsibility of our industrial and financial sectors. We deeply hope that the leaders of the city's financial and industrial sectors will take the lead in advocating and actively investing. The government and the people will definitely provide the best possible assistance.</p>
<p>The above two points are the directions in which the commercial sector should make special efforts in the future, and are also the efforts that the commercial sector should make in the movement of resisting the war and building the country. Finally, we respectfully wish all commercial compatriots in the city successful efforts. The Joint Association of Shanghai Commercial Organizations.</p>
<p>Attached is an outline of efforts for Commercial Day:</p>
<p>(1) Pay attention to distinguishing between domestic goods and inferior goods. (2) Work hard to promote genuine domestic goods. (3) Sever all ties with enemies and traitors. (4) Do not use enemy or puppet currencies. (5) Do not transport enemy goods. (6) Do not sell enemy goods. (7) Do not supply raw materials to enemy factories. (8) Develop the resources of the Southwest and Northwest to strengthen the foundation of the resistance war. (9) Save money for donations to enrich the foreign exchange fund. (10) Pay income tax and stamp tax to the central government. (11) Labor-management cooperation, work hard to produce domestic goods. (12) Improve industry organization, mutual assistance, and supervision.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Rice Market Experiences a Sharp Rise in Black Market Prices, Clearly Someone Is Manipulating the Market, Traders and Customers Are Taking the Opportunity to Monopolize, Enough to Hinder Normal Transactions, Concession Rice Shops Limit Prices for Fair Sales <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Although the rice price in the city has appeared to be stable on the surface in recent days, in reality, the black market transactions between traders and customers have suddenly exceeded the limited price. The market situation is once again chaotic. Various customer groups have requested a relaxation of the price limit to fifteen yuan. The Bean and Rice Industry Association has scheduled a special meeting tomorrow to discuss the matter. The concession authorities believe that the sharp rise in the rice market is clearly being manipulated and have dispatched personnel to closely monitor and punish those who disrupt public order and food supply. As for the proposal to order foreign rice, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce has studied the matter and concluded that, due to the high overseas prices, including freight and other expenses, which are more expensive than the domestic rice market price, it is not possible to order foreign rice. The Rice Shop Industry Association has ordered all rice shops within the concession to uniformly sell rice at a fair price according to the price limit. The details of these situations are recorded below by a reporter from the Modern News Agency.</p>
<p>Chaotic Market Prices</p>
<p>Regarding the city's rice prices, due to the lack of sources from the interior, warehouse owners in the market are taking the opportunity to buy up goods, resulting in a sharp rise in recent days, exceeding the limited price. Fortunately, the Bean and Rice Industry Association resolved to maintain the high price limit of fourteen yuan per bag, and the Market Management Committee advised peers and traders to sell at fair prices and strictly enforce the association's resolutions. After the market price stabilized slightly and merchants continued to transport goods, the situation improved. However, starting on March 10, market transactions experienced drastic changes again. Although the limited price of fourteen yuan was still maintained on the surface, the actual rice and grain traded between traders and customers was traded at a black market price, close to fifteen yuan. Yesterday (March 11), after the market opened, the market price rose sharply again. The highest quality white japonica rice actually rose to fifteen yuan outside the concession on the black market. Although the market tried its best to suppress the price, it was unable to stop it. The trading situation was unprecedentedly chaotic, so the market closed at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Request for Relaxation</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency, the rice market traders entering the market said that the rice price in the interior producing areas is high, almost equal to the limited price in Shanghai. In addition, after adding transportation costs and taxes, there is no profit to be made, so they requested a relaxation of the limited price to fifteen yuan per shi (unit of volume). The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association has specifically scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at 3:00 PM tomorrow (March 13) on the second floor of the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange to submit this request for discussion. According to the opinions of peers, if the issue of relaxing the price limit is approved by the association, it must also be approved by the Public Works Department before it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Authorities Monitoring</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council of the French Concession are very concerned about the rice price in Shanghai and are still maintaining their original plan to regulate the food supply for the more than four million people within the concession. The two authorities are cooperating to maintain order. Recently, the sudden rise in the rice price in Shanghai has greatly affected the livelihoods of ordinary people. In addition to dispatching personnel to the market to monitor transactions, any trader or customer found to be taking the opportunity to manipulate the market and monopolize goods, sufficient to hinder normal transactions, will be severely investigated, dealt with, and punished to maintain public order and food supply. The industry association will also strictly prevent traders and customers from raising prices and disrupting the market. Those who are found will also be publicly punished as a warning and deterrent.</p>
<p>High Foreign Rice Prices</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Industry Association and its member rice shops have close ties because they sell directly to consumers, so the association has decided to maintain the limited price. It will also set retail market prices: white rice, indica rice, and white indica rice at fourteen yuan per shi, and second-class rice at thirteen yuan and four dimes per shi. The industry will be rectified to uniformly comply with the assessed market prices and implement fair sales to maintain public order and food supply.</p>
<p>High Foreign Rice Prices</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the rice industry, there are currently 700,000 to 800,000 bags of rice in stock in Shanghai, equivalent to 1.2 to 1.3 million shi calculated in Shanghai bushels, which is enough to maintain the food supply in Shanghai for three months with surplus. Although there is a shortage of inventory in the interior producing areas, the daily shipments to Shanghai, no matter how much or little, can still make up for it, so there is no need to panic about the food supply for the time being. As for the Bean and Rice Industry Association, in order to plan for the future, it suggested in a letter to the two concession authorities that the authorities should prepare appropriate measures, such as ordering foreign rice or dredging sources. However, according to recent foreign market news, the rice production in Siam, Saigon, and other places was slightly less last year, and market prices have risen. It is not cost-effective to order foreign rice for shipment to Shanghai for relief. Based on the current rice stocks in Shanghai, there is no need to order foreign rice for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Japanese Side Rumors Total Attack on Pudong, Chinese Army on High Alert, Even If the Japanese Army Has No Such Intention, the Chinese Army Will Definitely Launch First <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Within the Pudong area, a traitor working within the Japanese army is spreading rumors to the outside world, saying that the Japanese army will take action again to invade the areas controlled by the guerrillas in order to eliminate the threat. However, according to general observations, the Japanese army's strength is weak, and the guerrillas' strength is strong, so this plan is unlikely to succeed. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Failed Invasion: During the spring of last year, the Japanese side took advantage of the opportunity of the retreat of troops from Hangzhou to invade the three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. At that time, they had 10,000 troops, hoping to solve the guerrilla forces of the three counties in one fell swoop. However, the Chinese side's actions were elusive and did not cause any damage, so after most of the Japanese troops were transferred out within ten days, a small number of Japanese troops still retreated to the strongholds along the river, and the guerrillas still controlled their original areas. Last winter, the Japanese army attempted to invade in three routes and even penetrated into the Mud City on the coast of Nanhui and the old Fengxian City. As a result, because the hinterland of the three counties was crisscrossed by rivers and swamps, and the bridges were broken, all routes were cut off, so the Japanese troops on all routes were completely repelled by the guerrillas.</p>
<p>Failed Enticement: The Japanese side also suffered losses and casualties in repeated military operations, and its efforts were fruitless, so it changed its tactics from threats to enticement, repeatedly persuading the Chinese army with generous terms to stop hostilities in order to avoid worries about the rear. However, shameless persuaders were repeatedly executed by the Chinese side on charges of being traitors. Last year, people like Ren Pengfei died for this reason, so the "silver bullet" policy was completely defeated by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Rumored Action: In recent days, traitors have revealed news that Sakurai, the commander of the Japanese Army Shanghai Garrison, summoned Uehiro, the commander of the Chuansha Garrison, Ogawa, the commander of the Nanhui Garrison, and Nakajima, the commander of the Fengxian Garrison, to a secret meeting, planning to forcibly transfer troops from the suburbs in secret, based on the current county seat of Chuansha, Zhoupu in Nanhui, and Fengxian. The three strongholds will then penetrate deeper into the hinterland of the three counties and attack the Chinese army in order to eliminate the threat and expand the puppet organization's territory. It is also rumored that action will begin after the weather clears, and the water traffic in western Pudong will be blocked at that time, causing unrest among the people in the Japanese army's area, and many plan to relocate temporarily.</p>
<p>Chinese Army Prepared: On the Chinese army's side in the three counties, they have received this information. Regardless of whether what the traitors said is just spreading rumors or whether the Japanese side has such intentions, they have already made the necessary preparations in terms of various deployments and communications. If the Japanese dare to take the risk of invading, they will be dealt a heavy blow. Moreover, the Eastern Theater Chinese army is very beneficial to the overall Eastern Theater war situation. Even if the Japanese army has no such intention, the Chinese army will definitely take the initiative to attack the Japanese army, implementing a containment and attrition war. Therefore, a major battle in Pudong is bound to be inevitable.</p>

He has controlled the four suburbs of the county and the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, which the Japanese army considers to be its lifeline, cut off the Shanghai-Songjiang and Shanghai-Songjiang highways, making it impossible for the Japanese and puppet troops to move. At the same time, he is supporting friendly forces and advancing towards southern Pudong to attack the Japanese army from both sides.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Inaccurate Content Reported by Japanese Newspapers, The Municipal Council Has Firmly Denied the Untrustworthy Alliance News Agency Report <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Mainland Daily reported that, regarding the Japanese report that the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Japanese authorities had agreed to take measures to prevent terrorists in the Public Concession, the reporter asked the Municipal Council about this last night (10th). The authorities denied the statement in the Japanese newspapers that the Japanese military police would not only set up offices in the Municipal Council's police stations, but also in all of its sub-stations.</p>
<p>According to the news released by the authorities, the agreement was reached on the 3rd of this month. The police authority and integrity of the Police Department are still maintained, but the full text of the agreement has not been released. On the evening of the agreement, the semi-official Japanese news agency, Alliance News Agency, sent a telegram to Japan, with a slightly different interpretation of the terms of the reconciliation. Most of the English and Japanese newspapers in Japan have published this report, and this newspaper has now received these newspapers, so the news of the Alliance News Agency has caused</p>
<p>Some speculation. According to the news, the agreement reached between the Japanese authorities and the Municipal Council regarding cooperation in maintaining order in the Public Concession is as follows: (1) Japanese military police will not only set up offices in the Municipal Council's police stations, but will also be established in all of its police stations. Plainclothes Japanese military police will be stationed at the office, collecting information on terrorists and taking responsibility on the streets.</p>
<p>Defense Duties (2) In order to prevent terrorists from entering the Public Concession, the Japanese military police will cooperate with the Municipal Council's police to inspect Chinese people and goods landing on the banks of the Huangpu River and the Suzhou River. The Municipal Council will also restrict the location and time of landing. (3) The Municipal Council will control traffic according to the Japanese side's request to facilitate the inspection of Chinese people's passes and personal belongings and will pay special attention to inspecting Chinese people entering and leaving the Public Concession and the French Concession. (4) The Municipal Council will</p>
<p>Set up a special department to discuss ways to facilitate cooperation between the Japanese side and the authorities of the Council. The head of the department will be appointed by a Japanese person. (5) In view of the fact that the Chinese police hired by the Council are not strong enough to control terrorists, the Japanese will take appropriate measures to guide the Chinese police. (6) The Japanese police will show newsreels to interrogate criminals and suspects arrested by the Japanese police and the Council's police. The reporter asked the Council about the points contained in the Japanese newspaper news. The answer was that the statement was completely inaccurate, but they did not add any other comments.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Japanese Conspiracy to Control and Plunder: Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Production Utterly Devastated; Kidnapping of Silk Factories Everywhere to Extort Silkworm Cocoons at Low Prices; Silkworm Farmers Establish Small Silk Factories to Barely Stay Afloat <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The silkworm and silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been actively promoted and improved by the government in recent years, resulting in a large increase in production, accounting for more than two-thirds of the country's total, and representing a major component of foreign trade. Since the outbreak of the war and the fall of the two provinces, the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been devastated. The Japanese side is also implementing economic aggression and conspiring to plunder and control, resulting in the utter destruction of the silk industry. The Modern News Agency reporter has investigated the details from various relevant parties, as follows:</p>
<p>Abundant Silkworm and Silk Production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>Due to the suitable climate and fertile land in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, which are conducive to the propagation of silkworms and mulberry trees, their production accounts for more than two-thirds of the country's total and occupies an important position in foreign trade. Since 1932, the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, in order to improve the silk industry and increase production, has carefully planned and established silk districts, ordered improved silkworm eggs from the United States, established silkworm breeding personnel training institutes, and organized large-scale silk factories, resulting in further progress in production. Every year, more than 3.5 million sheets of silkworm eggs can be produced, and more than one million piculs of raw silk can be exported, breaking previous production records and establishing a foundation in overseas markets.</p>
<p>Devastated After the Fall</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war of aggression against China and the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, silkworm and mulberry trees in various regions have been devastated. The Japanese army even forcibly removed mulberry seedlings, and the extent of the damage is still difficult to estimate. Subsequently, in order to conspire to plunder China's silkworm and silk industry, the Japanese side dispatched Mugi, Kubota Masashi, Sasaki Asahi, and others familiar with the situation in China to the silkworm production areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to conduct investigations. Furthermore, Suzuki Kakusaburo, a former employee of Mitsui &amp; Co., colluded with the traitor Zhang Zizhen and others to organize the "Huiming Company" in Wuxi in the summer of last year, merging the original Hefeng, Zhengyi, Anyu, Fulun, Zhenyuan, and other silk factories, totaling more than 2,000 silk looms. The capital was set at 50 million yuan, with the Japanese Hoshi Chuyu as the manager and the traitor Zhang Zizhen as the assistant manager. The source of raw materials was obtained by forcibly plundering from the people in various regions, or by coercively purchasing at low prices. All silkworm cocoons were also plundered. As a result, the company made a huge profit of more than 2 million yuan by the end of last year, in just a few months, which was in fact the lifeblood of the silkworm farmers.</p>
<p>Huazhong Company's Conspiracy to Control</p>
<p>The "Huiming Company" was reorganized into the "Huazhong Silkworm and Silk Company" in August of last year and intensified its conspiracy of aggression, hoping to implement control of the silk industry in Central China. Various plans were formulated, and management was implemented for silkworm eggs, mulberry fields, etc. Starting from January of this year, the pseudo "Huazhong Company" submitted the following conditions to various fields: (1) The company may dispatch one Japanese manager to each field, stationed permanently in the field, to manage everything, with the salary borne by the seed field; (2) Silkworm eggs shall be distributed by the company and shall not be copied or distributed; (3) Silkworm eggs shall be purchased by the company; (4) Half of the seed money shall be paid upon completion of production, and the remainder shall be paid in full or discounted depending on the silkworm harvest; (5) The company has the right to modify the articles of association at any time. The above measures were repeatedly convened by the Japanese side to convene meetings of various seed production fields, but because the general field owners were well aware of the righteousness and motivated by patriotic indignation, they were unwilling to be slaughtered by them, so they refused to participate. Therefore, this conspiracy of the Japanese side has not yet been fully implemented.</p>
<p>Only Small Silk Factories Remain in the Inland</p>
<p>Under the heavy pressure of Japanese violence, the original large-scale silk factories in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been kidnapped. However, the Japanese side does not attach importance to small silk factories with ten or twenty looms. Therefore, the general silkworm and silk industry personnel and farmers have raised small amounts of capital to purchase several looms and set up small silk factories in various villages. Because the price of cocoons is low, they can still make a slight profit. Those with more capital have moved to the Shanghai Concession to set up factories and start work. According to the investigation by the Modern News Agency reporter, there are 37 silk factories in this city, including Yihe Silk Factory, Shanghai Silk Factory, and Tongren Silk Factory, with more than 6,000 silk looms in total. Currently, the overseas Chinese silk market price is 1,200 to 1,300 yuan per picul, so the business of each factory is still good. Since the establishment of the "Huazhong Company," the source of raw materials will likely become a problem in the future.</p>

<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that, according to people from western Shanghai, a large number of residents in the Japanese-controlled area have fled into the Public Concession. Gunfire is heard almost every night in the western district, and the sounds have become more concentrated in recent nights. Even those accustomed to hearing gunfire and cannon fire feel uneasy in areas where guerrillas are active and the Japanese army is unable to control.</p>
<h3 id="e82">After the Success of the £10 Million Loan, the Legal Tender Reserves Are Further Consolidated; Four Banks' Issuance of Cash Reserves Changed to Deposit in the UK and US, Determined to Stabilize Exchange Rates and Maintain Creditworthiness with All Efforts <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>After the success of China's legal tender policy, the government, in order to replenish legal tender reserves and stabilize exchange rates, established a £10 million loan with HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, with the issuance of cash reserves stored in the UK and the US. The issuance policy remains serious. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Serious Legal Tender Issuance After the War</p>
<p>The legal tender policy had already seen success before the war, and its credibility has increased even after the war. The legal tender cash reserve has always been above 60%, while the guarantee reserve has been below 40%. All inspections have been in line with the legal ratio. The total amount of issuance was 1,639,098,000 yuan at the end of 1937, and increased to 1,726,998,000 yuan in June 1938. The rate of increase is not as fast as in the early days of the reform. From December 1935 to December 1936, the issuance increased by a total of 568,979,000 yuan. From December 1936 to December 1937, the issuance increased by a total of 379,136,000 yuan. This is sufficient proof of the prudence of legal tender issuance during the war, and also proof that the government has not resorted to paper money policy.</p>
<p>Preventing Legal Tender from Flowing into Occupied Areas</p>
<p>In order to prevent a large amount of legal tender from flowing into the occupied areas, the Ministry of Finance stipulated that all remittances from the inland to Shanghai should be paid in the form of draft notes, and all remittances from Shanghai to the inland should be paid in full in legal tender. Restrictions were also placed on the method of carrying legal tender to Shanghai. All ships passing through various customs offices to Shanghai were limited to 500 yuan. The remaining amount should be properly guaranteed, and upon arrival in Shanghai, the full amount should be transferred to the Central Bank of Shanghai as a current deposit. The principal and interest of domestic public bonds were changed to be paid in full in Chongqing, and Shanghai paid in six installments, with the aim of preventing a large amount of legal tender from flowing into Shanghai. As a result, the Japanese and puppet attempts to exchange legal tender for "fake banknotes" and "joint coupons" in order to obtain foreign exchange completely failed.</p>
<p>Cash Reserves Changed to Deposit in the UK and US</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired at the bank yesterday and learned that the cash reserves for the issuance of legal tender by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China have always been kept by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee and stored in the vaults of major domestic banks. After the war, the government has successively transported cash reserves, such as silver and gold, to the UK and the US, or entrusted them to be kept in custody, or exchanged them for foreign exchange and deposited them abroad. Now, in order to replenish the legal tender reserves, a £10 million loan has been established with HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. These funds are all deposited in London, England, and a capital operation committee has been organized. Therefore, the legal tender cash reserves will be further consolidated in the future, and the government will use all its efforts to stabilize foreign exchange and maintain creditworthiness.</p>
<p>The Future of Finance Feels More Stable</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance made every effort to stabilize the national finance after the war, funds flowed into the cities, and with the regulation of public and private financial institutions, funds became more abundant. Joint offices and discount committees of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China have been established in various places, so the national finance remains stable as usual. Since the success of the recent UK and US credit loans, China's international balance of payments has become more favorable, so the future of finance feels more stable. Seeing that their own reserves are sufficient, various banks have successively established branch offices or representative offices in the southwest and northwest to assist the government in developing and building the interior and shifting the center of finance to the interior. Therefore, funds in the interior have become more abundant, which is of great help to the development of production.</p>

<p>Continental News reports that, according to the "Miller's Review Weekly" published today (the 11th), Spielmann, chairman of the Committee for German-Jewish Refugees in Shanghai, received a telegram from Dong Xianguang, Deputy Minister of Propaganda, who is currently in Chongqing, stating that he intends to submit a tentative suggestion to the central government to designate certain areas in the southwest and northwest of China for Jewish refugees to immigrate to, and asked for opinions from the Shanghai Jewish community on whether this suggestion should be submitted and whether it is appropriate to establish a semi-official agency to find work for technical personnel among the immigrants in China. The Refugee Committee expressed concern about this suggestion and is currently studying it from various aspects. However, Mr. Spielmann met with reporters and firmly denied receiving this telegram, but he expressed surprise and concern upon hearing the news.</p>

<p>After the death of the Roman Catholic Pope Pius XI, the College of Cardinals elected Cardinal Secretary of State Pacelli as Pope, naming him Pius XII, implying the implementation of the policies of the previous Pope. Chinese Catholics were delighted to hear the good news. The new Pope is extraordinarily virtuous, learned, and capable, having served as Secretary of State for nine years, familiar with Catholic affairs in various countries, and is a famous diplomat. He has made great efforts to improve the status of Catholicism in China and promote the Catholic Progress Association, and loves China as much as the previous Pope. Therefore, Mr. Zhu Zhiyao and Mr. Lu Yingen of the Shanghai Catholic Progress Association sent a telegram to congratulate him on behalf of the Catholics the day before yesterday. They received a reply from the new Pope yesterday to thank them and bestow apostolic blessings. The association also decided to specially invite Father Xu Zongze, instructor, to hold a mass for the Lord at 7:30 this morning at the Sacred Heart Church on Avenue Joffre, to bestow health and longevity to the new Pope and increase his virtue.</p>

<p>Continental News reports that yesterday (the 10th), Father Ki of the Xujiahui Observatory forecast to the people of Shanghai that although the continuous rain and fog for the past nine days has made people feel slightly uncomfortable, there will be more humid weather in the future. Father Ki told reporters that rain and fog are not an abnormal phenomenon at this time of the season. The average rainfall record has not yet been broken. Warm southwestern air and cold Siberian air are each following their respective paths, coming to Shanghai from Sichuan, and are currently meeting over Central China, causing seasonal rain and fog. However, the weather situation is gradually moving northeastward, and by the beginning of April, Shanghai will have warm southwestern air. It is expected that there will be slight rain at that time. Yesterday late at night, it was still raining in Shanghai. Tomorrow, Sunday, it may be cloudy and rainy again. If the rain does not stop, it will be the fifth consecutive cloudy and rainy Sunday.</p>

<p>Since the resumption of operations on the 1st of this month at the five tax collection offices of Jianghai Customs at the North Railway Station, Beili'nan Road, Hongqiao Road, Daxi Road, and North Suzhou Road, progress has been smooth. A reporter inquired at Jianghai Customs yesterday and learned that, according to those in charge of the Customs, in order to make it difficult for all native goods exported from the Concession area or imported from the inland to evade taxes or smuggle in the future, it has been decided to prepare to add six tax collection offices at the main road ports near the borders of the two Concessions and the occupied areas. It is heard that there are six places: Maigeng Road, Mint, Xujiahui, Fanhangdu, South Railway Station, etc. The work is currently in progress, and it can be officially opened for business in early April.</p>

<p>The British Public Bus Company made a considerable profit last year due to passenger congestion. In view of the fact that even with four or five buses running continuously on each route, it is still impossible to accommodate passengers, the company has ordered more than 40 new military vehicles from the British Automobile Company. Currently, seven of these vehicles have arrived in Shanghai and are being assembled in the factory. Once completed, they will be added to Route 9 for operation. The remaining vehicles will also arrive in Shanghai and be assembled for operation in February. Therefore, the congestion problem of public buses in this city can be solved.</p>

<p>The Thrift and Disaster Relief Association issued an announcement yesterday, advising citizens not to use shark fin to entertain guests. The original text reads, "Shark fin is an item of high value, and it still needs chicken soup and ham to season it. Since the Chinese coast has been blockaded, this product has also been seized. We are living on an isolated island, seeking pleasure for our appetite. Why bear to spend the most expensive price to buy this hard-to-enjoy food? If shark fin is excluded from a banquet, then other dishes will be more delicious. The host's affection and the guests' pleasure will be more enjoyable, and there will be no guilt after being drunk and full. Wouldn't it be beautiful and good? Our association sincerely advises, adhering to the principle of thrift. If customers do not demand it, then the restaurants will not provide it.

<p>After the Ministry of Finance approved the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's request to find a way to exchange damaged banknotes, it ordered the four banks of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China to comply. Now the four banks have jointly announced, "If the banknotes issued by our banks are damaged, please bring the banknotes directly to our banks for exchange during business hours. Our banks will exchange them at any time according to the method of exchanging damaged banknotes, depending on the extent of the damage. Please be informed." A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired at the four banks yesterday and learned that the report that the Broken Banknote Exchange Office had opened the other day was inaccurate. If there are broken banknotes from various banks, you can go directly to that office for exchange. That exchange office has nothing to do with the four banks and was not established by the four banks. It is obviously for profit by exchanging damaged banknotes. It is hoped that banknote holders will exchange directly with the four banks, and the exchange method will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee.</p>

On the afternoon of January 16, at around 8:00 PM, she took advantage of the opportunity to put ten pre-purchased Western medicine Diazepam sleeping pills into the cough medicine pot that Zhuang Xu was having her brew and drink. After Madam Zhuang drank it, she died of poisoning at 4:00 AM the next morning. Someone reported it to the Huishi Police Station in charge, and they dispatched detectives to arrest Zhuang Qian and escort her to the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, filed a public prosecution for the crime of murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law, stating that although Zhuang Qian was not the biological daughter of the deceased, she had been raised to this day, reaching 30 years, and was truly unconscionable, repaying kindness with vengeance, requesting the most severe punishment. After deliberation and debate, he awaited sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Changsheng came to the Third Criminal Court and sentenced Zhuang Qian to life imprisonment for murder, depriving her of civil rights for life. The medicine pot was detained in the warehouse, and he declared to Madam Zhuang, "Although the Municipal Council's chemist cannot verify what kind of poison is in the boiled cough medicine pot that has been soaked in clear water, you have admitted twice in court that you put ten Diazepam sleeping pills into the medicine pot to harm your adoptive mother. You cannot deny it. This court sentences you to death, but now I spare you from death and sentence you to life imprisonment. If you are not satisfied with the judgment, you can appeal within ten days."</p>

At that time, they saw a Shanghai woman, Chen Wangshi (resident of 16 Qipu Road), looking flustered. They immediately stopped her and confiscated 366 small packets of heroin. They took her back to the Capture Office. Under interrogation, she confessed that her foster mother, Gu Wangshi, introduced her to a Korean man and asked her to transport the drugs. The detectives then went to 8, Lane 69, Racecourse Road and arrested Gu Wangshi, confiscating one opium lamp and one opium pipe. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. The Capture Office lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted them according to Article 3 of the Drug Prohibition Regulations (which could result in the death penalty). Chen Wangshi confessed during the interrogation that she really did not understand the situation, so she was deceived. Moreover, she has an elderly mother above her and children below, requesting the court to deal with her leniently. Gu Wangshi confessed to smoking opium without denial, but admitted to introducing Chen Wangshi to a certain Korean man to take on transportation work. After the court appointed lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them, Judge Feng immediately sentenced Chen Wangshi to two years of imprisonment in court and Gu Wangshi to eight months of imprisonment as a warning. The heroin was confiscated.</p>

<p>The residents of Shanghai are a mixed bag, and cases of fraud and abduction occur from time to time. On the 9th of this month, a certain girls' school in the city discovered someone impersonating a school teacher to swindle money from students' parents. The details of the incident are as follows: There were three female students, Gao, Zhu, and Huang, all studying at a certain girls' school and living near Haig Road. At 1:00 PM on the 9th, a</p>
<p>Young Woman, wearing a qipao and leather shoes, dressed quite fashionably, claiming to be surnamed Hu and a teacher at the girls' school, the teacher of their daughter, appeared at Gao's house looking anxious. She said to Gao's parents that her young son had suddenly fallen seriously ill and had been sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. After the doctor's diagnosis, he was instructed to be hospitalized and had to pay a deposit of 22 yuan for the room and medical expenses according to the regulations. Because she only had 14 yuan with her, she still owed 8 yuan. Because going home</p>
<p>Would be too far and time-consuming, she came nearby to ask for a temporary loan, promising to repay it that evening. Seeing that she was quite presentable and spoke fluently, and since she was their daughter's teacher, Gao's parents did not suspect anything and lent her 8 yuan. After obtaining these 8 yuan, this imposter went to Zhu's house nearby, intending to use the same trick. However, seeing that there were many people in the student's home,</p>
<p>Fearing exposure, she did not speak and left directly. She then went to Huang's house nearby and used the same story to earnestly request a loan. Huang's parents happened to be short on cash at the time, so they did not agree. They expressed their apologies to this Hu, and as it was raining heavily, Huang's parents felt sorry for her and offered to hire a car for her, but Hu declined and borrowed an umbrella before leaving. At 4:00 PM, after school was dismissed, the students returned home,</p>
<p>And after inquiring about the incident, they realized that it was someone impersonating a school teacher. However, the person had already left and could not be traced. The swindler managed to obtain 8 yuan in cash and an umbrella within an hour. Parents of students at all schools in the city are urged to pay close attention to this type of scam.</p>

<p>Yu Ziyun, a Ningbo native, age 35, owner of the Ningbo tofu shop at 141 Caishi Street in the French Concession, had previously married Yu Panshi (age 27 this year), also from his hometown. They had been married and living together for ten years and had three children. The couple had a very close relationship on weekdays. Unexpectedly, last year, Yu hired his cousin Yu Axi (age 25 this year) as a shop assistant. Unexpectedly, Axi was young and romantic, and often went upstairs under the pretext of holding his nephew,</p>
<p>Teasing his sister-in-law, Panshi. Day after day, Panshi was bewitched and they fell in love and had a physical relationship. Yu Ziyun found out about this at the end of last year and, for the sake of his reputation, he tolerated it and only dismissed Axi. Unexpectedly, Axi could not sever his love and often sneaked into the shop while Yu Ziyun was out, instigating Panshi to steal clothing and cash worth over 400 yuan and elope with him on the night of February 22nd this year.</p>
<p>They hid in Room 28 of the Yong'an Hotel on Maigen Road in western Shanghai. Her husband, Yu Ziyun, reported this to the French Police, and the detectives discovered their whereabouts. On the 28th of the same month, they rushed to the Yong'an Hotel on Maigen Road and arrested both Yu Axi and Yu Panshi, taking them back to the French Police Station, escorting them to the Second Special Court, and detained them for investigation, and adjourned for a further hearing on the record. Yesterday, the court was convened for continued trial. The French Concession authorities, based on the crime of disrupting the family,</p>
<p>Prosecuted them. The plaintiff, Yu Ziyun, also appeared in court to state the circumstances of his wife being seduced and running away. He also said that because his children were young and lacked care at home, he requested leniency for Panshi and requested that the second defendant be severely punished according to the law. After questioning the defendants, they confessed to the adultery without denial. After reviewing the confession, the court immediately sentenced Yu Axi to one year of imprisonment as a warning. Yu Panshi was not prosecuted and was to be released and taken back by her husband.</p>

Unable to bear the pain, the other day, a neighbor surnamed He rescued the girl and took her to stay temporarily with relatives at 13, Lane 269, Xiafei Road, French Concession. He then wrote a letter to report to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association on Edward Road. Liu Wenlin, an employee of the association, reported the situation to the Gordon Road Capture Office, which sent detectives to investigate and arrest Lin Zhushi. She was taken to the Capture Office and the girl was sent to a women's shelter. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Capture Office, prosecuted her for abuse under Article 286 of the Criminal Law and stated the circumstances, saying that Lin Mei had been examined by a doctor at Guangren Hospital, who had verified that her head, buttocks, back, and legs were bruised and swollen. Then, Lin Mei testified about the abuse she had suffered and showed her injuries. When the defendant was questioned, she denied the allegations. Judge Huang sentenced Lin Zhushi to six months of imprisonment, suspended for three years. The girl was sent to the Jiliang Shelter for care.</p>

<h3 id="e123">The Education and Care of Refugee Children <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>With the current War of Resistance, countless young refugees have emerged. Their homes have been destroyed by the aggressors' artillery fire, and they have all become refugee children with no work to do and no books to read. Some are living in shelters, while others are wandering the streets and alleys, begging for a living.</p>
<p>Who would deny that children are the future masters of a country, and the nation and society have a responsibility to educate and care for them? How can these refugee children be abandoned outside the sphere of education and care? Especially in this era of resisting aggression and building the nation, they are the lifeline of the country, the future soldiers, and are of great importance to the nation, so we cannot ignore them.</p>
<p>Therefore, refugee children's schools have been established in various shelters. The China Child Education Society has also advocated the education of street children and has established many street children's schools. The Shanghai International Relief Committee has established a vocational education and care center for street children on Xiamen Road. The Shanghai Relief Refugee Children Education and Care Home is raising funds to build its own facilities to accommodate as many refugee children as possible. In addition to founding a newspaper boy school, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association is actively preparing to establish a beggar children's education and care home, which will soon be established. As for the education and care of refugee children, on the one hand, it is of course necessary to maintain their lives, but on the other hand, attention must be paid to education. Such education and care not only enable them to maintain their current lives, but also impart to them the necessary knowledge and skills for life, cultivate their national consciousness, and foster their spirit and ability to be self-reliant, so that they can become useful members of society in the future and contribute to the country.</p>
<p>Therefore, the following principles should be particularly noted in the education of refugee children:</p>
<p>1. Cultivate national consciousness: To enable them to have a deep understanding of the current national crisis and actively cultivate their unity, love for the motherland, and protection of the nation's survival.</p>
<p>2. Cultivate the spirit of self-reliance: Shelters and educational institutions must not be old folks' homes that bury their lives. Their dependence should be eradicated, and their spirit of independent creation and determination to serve society should be cultivated.</p>
<p>3. Cultivate a scientific mind: To impart the knowledge necessary for life, and to use this knowledge to analyze, understand, and solve various problems in life.</p>
<p>4. Cultivate the ability to produce: To guide them in productive skills in labor, to develop their skills as workers, and to provide them with a way out for future self-reliance.</p>
<p>5. Cultivate hygienic habits: Most refugee children are dirty, and the cultivation of hygienic habits is especially important. It must be guided at all times in daily life.</p>

<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>— Written to commemorate the "Sun Yat-sen Death Anniversary" in the 28th year [of the Republic]</p>
<p>The bells rang, and the children of all grades lined up and entered the auditorium in order. Above the auditorium door, a cypress archway with the words "The World is for All" was specially erected for the day. Several wreaths were placed on the stage, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere.</p>
<p>After the formalities were completed, Principal Li, in a tragic and solemn tone, reported the passing of Sun Yat-sen. The entire hall was silent. He said, "Today is March 12th, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. Since advocating revolution, Sun Yat-sen truly never ceased thinking about revolution and doing revolutionary work. After the founding of the Republic of China, many warlords were dictatorial, and Sun Yat-sen continued to struggle, using many methods to overthrow the warlords and achieve peaceful unification.</p>
<p>In September of the 13th year of the Republic [1924], when the northern warlords were in fierce fighting, Sun Yat-sen believed that the opportunity to overthrow the warlords had come. He led his troops on the Northern Expedition. Later, Wu Peifu's officers defected, and the warlords disintegrated. Sun Yat-sen then went to the north alone to carry out the work of peaceful unification. He advocated convening a National Assembly to gather representatives from various groups to solve national affairs, and he gave speeches everywhere to make the people understand his proposals. However, he was too mentally exhausted, and when he arrived in Tianjin, he discovered the liver cancer that had resulted from overwork. Despite being treated by many famous doctors, it was not effective. Mr. Sun still traveled to Beijing with his illness and entered the Xiehe Hospital for radium treatment, but it was also ineffective. On the morning of March 11th, his mind suddenly became very clear. He summoned his wife, Soong Ching-ling, his son, Sun Ke, and Jingwei and others to his bedside, explaining that his proposals had not been realized and hoping that his comrades would work hard. He also ordered that the will prepared on the 24th of last month be presented, and he personally signed it with a fountain pen. Suddenly, he shouted 'Peace!' 'Struggle!' 'Save China!' one after another, more than forty times, before passing away at 10:30 AM on the 12th, at the age of sixty. The news of this unfortunate event shocked the hearts of people all over China and the world. Grand memorial services were held everywhere. On the day of the funeral in Beijing, there were 100,000 people sending him off, which shows the greatness and deeply moving nature of Sun Yat-sen's character. After Mr. Sun's death, his coffin was temporarily placed in the Biyun Temple in the Western Hills of Beiping. In the 18th year [of the Republic, 1929], his remains were moved south and enshrined in the mausoleum on Zijin Mountain in Nanjing, for later generations to pay their respects."</p>
<p>After Principal Li finished his report, Teacher Chen also spoke: "Children! Premier Sun shouted the slogan of Peace, Struggle, and Save China at his death. Let us look at the current situation in China. Our government is struggling arduously for the freedom of the nation. At this moment when we are commemorating the Premier on this isolated island [Shanghai], what kind of determination should we have to seek the true 'Peace' of our country?</p>
<p>After Teacher Chen finished speaking, the meeting was dismissed.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Why Thermos Bottles Keep Things Warm <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Chang</p>
<p>Children: Did you know that boiling water or ice cream, when placed in a thermos bottle, can maintain their temperature? If it were a glass bottle, wouldn't the result be completely different? Because heat is always transferred through: (1) convection, (2) conduction, and (3) radiation. If these three can be avoided, then the temperature will naturally not change. Now, I will briefly describe each of these three aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Convection — Hot fluids rise, and cold fluids descend. This is called convection, which is the transfer of heat from one place to another by a hot body or a heated part of a fluid. Since the temperature inside a thermos bottle is the same throughout, there is no convective heat transfer, so the temperature does not change.</p>
<p>(2) Conduction — Conduction requires an intermediate medium, either solid or gas. Thermos bottles do not have a solid intermediate medium, which is obvious and does not need to be discussed. Regarding gases, I will add a little more: the glass of a thermos bottle is double-layered, with a vacuum in between. Even if heat passes through the glass layer, it cannot escape through the vacuum, which is one reason why the thermos bottle can maintain its temperature.</p>
<p>(3) Radiation — Many scientists have hypothesized that a weightless and elastic substance called ether permeates space. Light and heat rely on ether to propagate, which is called radiation. Radiant heat can pass through a vacuum because there is ether in the vacuum. So, why does the temperature in a thermos bottle remain unchanged? Because radiation is absorbed the least by light-colored, bright white objects, and the glass layers of thermos bottles are coated with extremely shiny mercury, so radiation does not easily escape. If you observe snow melting in sunlight, it melts very slowly. If you cover it with black smoke or black ash, the speed increases, which proves that the absorption of radiant heat by a material is greatly related to its color and brightness.</p>
<p>I have explained it simply above. Children, do you understand?</p>
<h3 id="e126">Farewell, Hangzhou <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—Fifteenth of the "Ming'er's Travelogue"—</p>
<p>Ming'er and the others boarded the boat in the middle of the night, and they were all very tired. When they got on the boat, some of the timid people still had pounding hearts. Ming'er also felt this way. The boat was relatively spacious and had four berths. The Zhang and Li families had fewer people, so they each occupied one berth, while Ming'er's family occupied two berths. Ming'er's mother asked the boatman to put the luggage she didn't need in the hold and to keep the daily necessities close at hand, so they were busy for a while.</p>
<p>Although Ming'er's family had two berths, it was not enough space, so Ming'er and his father and brothers had to sleep on the deck. Mr. and Mrs. Zhang and Li let their wives sleep in the berths, while they and their sons squeezed onto the deck as well. So, more than a dozen people slept on such a small deck, which was obviously not enough. Fortunately, Mr. Zhang came up with a clever idea: each person inserted their feet between the bodies of the two people opposite them, which solved the problem of sleeping. "This is a trench," Mr. Zhang said to Ming'er with a chuckle, and then said to his father, "Do we want to make our blankets into a trench? It would be more comfortable, but we are not responsible for the foot odor." These words made them laugh. Ming'er felt that sleeping like sardines in a can was much more comfortable than on the small boat in the previous two days, because they could finally stretch out their heads and feet. As a result, Ming'er was fast asleep in less than a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>Ming'er was sleeping soundly when he seemed to hear someone saying, "Qiantang River Railway Bridge..." He suddenly sat up and looked out of the cabin with tired eyes. It was just dawn, and the Qiantang River was shrouded in a hazy white mist, like a white veil covering the surface of the river. At this time, Ming'er gradually felt a little cold. Through the heavy fog, he saw a faint outline of a large iron bridge. His father praised, "This magnificent project is rare in China. Ming'er, I hope that you will be an engineer who can build such a great project in the future." Ming'er also admired the engineers who built the Qiantang River Bridge and hoped that he could make such a great contribution, but he didn't dare to say it out loud. Their boat gradually entered the bridge opening. At this time, the light inside the boat was dimmer than before, as if they were in a cave. After about two minutes, the boat gradually brightened, and the boat moved forward, gradually moving away from Hangzhou. The shadow of the bridge changed from clear to blurry, and a pang suddenly rose in Ming'er's heart, because he had long admired Hangzhou and now had such a good opportunity to miss it, so he prayed silently, "May the Qiantang River Bridge last forever, and may we be able to return to Hangzhou." In an instant, the shadow of the bridge disappeared.</p>
<p>The boat sailed very smoothly, and the people inside the boat were very busy because they had just gotten up, and more than thirty people had to do the work of getting up: hot water, towels, toothbrushes, they were all busy. Ming'er took a washbasin, drew some water from the river, washed his face on the bow of the boat, and breathed some fresh air. His father also came out to see the beautiful scenery. He pointed his finger at the pagoda and said, "Ming'er, look, that's the Liuhe Pagoda in Hangzhou. And if you look over there, the houses on the mountain are the Zhijiang University. You must have heard of it." Ming'er then said, "Yes, the environment of that school is extremely beautiful. With such an environment, how could one not make progress? Dad, I hope to go to that school in the future." His father said, "We'll talk about it when the time comes."</p>
<p>The Liuhe Pagoda in Hangzhou disappeared, and Ming'er muttered to himself, "Goodbye, Hangzhou. I wish you eternal peace."</p>

<p>— Zhixun</p>
<p>Dreams can also have a home. Children may question me when they see this title, "We have never heard of the term 'dreamer.' We only know scientists, educators..." But please be patient, children, and listen to me. The story of Edison hatching eggs was originally his dream of becoming a successful scientist.</p>
<p>The success of the radio was the result of Marconi's dream.</p>
<p>The convenience of using the telegraph today, who can deny that it is not the success of Morse's dream of a world transportation revolution? If Stephenson had not dreamed of inventing the automobile when he was a miner, would there be today's progress?</p>
<p>The realization of the submarine telegraph, if it were not for Field's dream, could there have been a connection between the two continents across the Atlantic Ocean!</p>
<p>There are too many such examples to mention.</p>
<p>Needless to say, humankind's liberation from baseness, its struggle for freedom from oppression, and its pursuit of a comfortable and happy life, we all have to thank our dreams!</p>
<p>Yes, all of today's successes are the sum of all the dreams of the past — the result of the realization of all the dreams of the past. Without dreams, mankind will never have progress.</p>
<p>However, dreams cannot escape the category of good and bad like other abilities. If someone misuses or abuses the power of dreams, they spend all their vitality on castles in the air that they cannot realize. This is undeniable. This kind of dreaming performance is just like a mad dog biting everywhere; the result of this kind of dreaming is just the decline of ability, collapsing due to inactivity. If I were to give an example of such dreamers, I think children would be able to guess it. It is truly like a microcosm of our strong neighbor.</p>
<p>We must not stop dreaming, but rather promote it! Conversely, even if we transfer our dreams to war, we must of course make our dreams of freedom, peace, national rejuvenation, and world security successful. Moreover, the realization of this great dream of ours is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Children, do you want to be a dreamer?</p>

<p>Q: Why can a fountain pen automatically draw ink into it?</p>
<p>A: There is a rubber tube inside a fountain pen. When we flatten the tube, the air inside is squeezed out. When we let go, the rubber tube returns to its original shape, and the ink in the ink bottle is pressed into the tube by atmospheric pressure because of the reduced pressure inside the tube. Therefore, a fountain pen can automatically draw ink into it.</p>

<p>Q: Why can a circus performer somersault on a horse and still land on the horse?</p>
<p>A: A circus performer somersaults on a horse and still lands on the horse due to inertia. Because the person is sitting on the horse and moving with the horse. When he somersaults, his body continues to move due to inertia, and his forward speed is always the same as the horse's speed (not counting air resistance), so he can still land on the horse.</p>

<p>Q: If the tea is too hot, blowing on the cup will soon cool it down, or transferring the tea between two cups will also work. Why is this?</p>
<p>A: Blowing on the cup or transferring the tea between two cups can promote the evaporation of water. Evaporation absorbs heat, so it can cool the tea.</p>

<p>Q: Explain the types and functions of glasses?</p>
<p>A: There are three types of glasses: nearsighted glasses (made with concave lenses), farsighted glasses (made with convex lenses), and plano glasses (made with flat lenses). Glasses have two functions: one is to block dust, and the other is to correct vision.</p>

Its positive electrode (carbon electrode) is in the center, and its negative electrode (zinc electrode) is on the side.</p>

<p>(1) Because a person must know the principles of being a human being in order to stand in the world; to know the principles of being a human being, one must study civics books.</p>
<p>(2) Our people have always lacked public morality, knowing only selfishness and self-interest, disregarding the life and death of others, with a "I would rather betray the world than let the world betray me" mentality. If we want to improve this bad habit, we must also be familiar with civics books. Because there are theories in civics books such as "I am for everyone, and everyone is for me," "self-restraint and benevolence," and "the world is one family." When we elementary school students read them, we will have a deep impression, and we will not have the bad habit of selfishness and self-interest in the future.</p>
<p>(3) We elementary school students are the future masters of the country, but as masters, we must have a deep understanding of the meaning of the Party, etc., and a detailed understanding. To understand the meaning of the Party, etc., we must start with the revolution. Therefore, in order to consolidate our position as masters, we must study civics books.</p>
<h3 id="e131">The Benefits of Diligence <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yuan, Sixth Grade, Fuxing Elementary School</p>
<p>Dear children, do you all know the saying "Diligence leads to success, play leads to nothing"? From this saying, we can know that diligence is the foundation of life. Like a farmer, if he does not diligently cultivate the field, then his future harvest will certainly not be abundant. If a worker does not diligently work, then his future works will certainly be of poor quality. If a businessman does not diligently work, then his business will not prosper in the future. From this, we can know how great the harm of not being diligent is. Children, if you do not diligently study at school, what will be the result in the future? In my opinion, you will certainly fail in your studies! Therefore, I hope with all my heart that you children will diligently study hard at school, and diligently do some light work at home. Not only will you have hope of success in your studies, but you will also be able to achieve the goal of "being a good man only by not relying on others."</p>
<h3 id="e132">My Use of Sunday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Ho Mei-ling, Sixth Grade Student of Yunzhong Elementary School</p>
<p>On Sundays, all institutions and schools are routinely closed. For students, Sunday seems like a day specifically for recreation. Therefore, on Saturdays, everyone is saying to each other, "Where are you going to play tomorrow?" "I'm going to the cinema to watch a movie." "No, tomorrow I'm definitely going to have a whole day of fun!" In reality, is Sunday exclusively for students to play? No, it's mainly used to rest our minds, because from Monday to Saturday, for six days, our brains are used for coursework, with no free time at all. Therefore, we use this time to let them rest for a while. But it's not like we don't use them at all. So, my use of Sunday is like this:</p>
<p>1.  Reviewing what has been taught – Why do we need to review what has been taught? Because we need to know what we have actually gained in school during these six days. Do I fully understand what the teacher taught? If there's anything I don't understand, remember to ask the teacher on Monday. Otherwise, if we know something and then forget it later, isn't that the same as not studying at all? So, we must review what has been taught.</p>
<p>2.  Preparing for what will be taught – On Sundays, we should also prepare for the lessons that we will be learning. Why? Because if you don't prepare and don't know the content or the details, the teacher will just keep talking, and you will be completely confused and feel like it's meaningless, and you won't be able to listen attentively. As a result, you won't understand anything. For example, if you don't prepare vocabulary when reading English, the teacher will keep talking, and you won't know what they are talking about. It's like feeling around blindly with your eyes closed. So, this is also an important thing to do.</p>
<p>These two things can definitely be completed in the morning. In the afternoon, I go for appropriate leisure or find some proper entertainment.</p>
<p>1.  In the afternoon, if I have the chance, I will gather a few classmates and go to the bookstores on Fuzhou Road to read books. If I find anything good or that suits my interests, I will buy it and take it home. Going to bookstores or libraries to read is a very good activity. If a student has a regular habit of going, it can not only provide leisure but also increase their knowledge and learning.</p>
<p>2.  If I don't go out, then I will play Ping-Pong with my brothers and sisters. Because it is also a harmless and proper form of leisure.</p>
<p>In addition, various normal entertainments such as playing chess are all things that I like to play.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Snow White (10) <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Sun</p>
<p>Before Snow White could finish speaking, seven cheerful voices simultaneously exclaimed, "Cooking? Did you say cooking?"</p>
<p>The princess proudly replied, "Yes, I can cook anything, even desserts. Apple dumplings, berry cakes, gooseberry buns!"</p>
<p>The seven dwarfs cheered in unison, "Gooseberry buns! Haha, how wonderful, how wonderful! She's decided to stay." Immediately, the seven dwarfs held hands and began to dance a simple and fun dance, like happy children dancing around a Christmas tree during Christmas.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the stubborn old one suddenly shook his hands, stepped aside, frowned, and looked at his happy companions, making a disgusted sound, "So, for a gooseberry bun, you are willing to take such a great risk, not even caring about your lives?"</p>
<p>His companions unanimously shouted, "Of course, of course! Don't you want to eat it? Those hot and delicious gooseberry buns!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the stubborn old one seemed to see a picture of everyone devouring gooseberry buns, and his mouth unconsciously filled with saliva. But he still muttered, "Well, do as you please, but the result will definitely not be good. Regardless of the buns or no buns, she is still a woman! Once there is a woman, troubles will follow!"</p>
<p>But none of his companions listened to him, because the thought of the sweet and delicious gooseberry buns had already made them forget about being afraid of the queen.</p>
<p>Snow White hurriedly said, "Please forgive me, I must prepare dinner for you now." After speaking, she quickly ran downstairs to see if the soup she had been cooking was done.</p>
<p>Hearing that there was dinner to eat, the seven dwarfs followed her downstairs one by one. When Snow White lifted the pot lid, the aroma of the soup wafted into their noses. They rushed to the dining table, reaching for small spoons and waiting, looking very eager. When Snow White saw them eating, she secretly marveled at how greedy they looked, just like children.</p>
<p>The princess said softly, "Dinner is not completely ready yet. You have plenty of time to take a bath."</p>
<p>They seemed to have never heard such a thing before and asked in surprise, "Take a bath? Take a bath? Why? We don't want to go there, and it's not New Year's. Why should we take a bath?"</p>

<h3 id="e134">Don't Forget to Pay Income Tax After Making Money <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Dun</p>
<p>Due to the special environment and the surge in population, all industries on the isolated island have experienced abnormal prosperity. Last year, it could be said that every business made a lot of money. Among them, the yarn and flower industry had the most astonishing profits.</p>
<p>I have a relative who runs a yarn and flower business. Although the factory he opened was very small, with capital of only 200,000, he earned 350,000 last year, almost twice the capital. In addition, according to what I know, several yarn and flower factories distributed bonuses at the end of the year that amounted to 100 months' salary. For example, a small clerk with a monthly salary of 50 yuan received a bonus of 5,000 yuan at the end of the year. It seems unbelievable, but these are the actual circumstances.</p>
<p>Not only the yarn and flower industry is like this, but all other industries are the same. The only difference is the amount of profit. As a result, whether they are shareholders, bosses, or employees, everyone is beaming with joy. So, it's no wonder that this year's lunar New Year was decorated exceptionally lively. It is no wonder that what is overflowing on the isolated island is a scene of prosperity and peace.</p>
<p>It is naturally very normal to enjoy oneself after making money. However, while you are enjoying yourselves, I wonder if you remember that our motherland is waging a difficult struggle for freedom and survival?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that modern warfare is economic warfare. In other words, economic abundance can affect the outcome of the war. Germany's failure in the European War is a perfect example. Although our government's finances are stable and substantial, and we also have the enthusiastic assistance of friendly nations, based on the divine duty of "those with strength contributing strength and those with money contributing money" and to ensure the swift attainment of final victory, I cannot help but make an earnest appeal to all profitable manufacturers!</p>
<p>This does not mean that we hope all industries will donate all their profits to the government (it would certainly be best if they could), but they should not evade the national duty—income tax and wartime profits tax—but should pay them actively!</p>
<p>Many people have already raised this point before, and it seems unnecessary for me to repeat it. However, according to what I have learned from relevant sources, there are too few people paying income tax, so I earnestly raise it again!</p>
<p>Everyone knows that income tax is a good tax, and I don't need to say more. However, what must be mentioned is that in European and American countries, when it comes to wartime, they often increase the income tax rate to increase the income of the national treasury. And our government still maintains the original tax rate to this day. This shows how considerate the government is of the people's sentiments! So, if we make money and still evade this good tax, I ask, can you live up to the government? Can you live up to your own conscience?</p>
<p>I know that the merchants on the isolated island are very patriotic, as evidenced by the fact that a few months ago, when the post office stopped selling stamp tax, all trade associations went to the mainland to purchase them in order to affix them and maintain national tax revenue. This shows that my words are not blind compliments. Therefore, I earnestly hope that all industries will actively pay income tax and wartime profits tax after closing their accounts this year.</p>
<p>As for the report form and tax payment, they can be sent to the Shanghai office of the Central Bank on Albert Road.</p>

<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Scene Four</p>
<p>(Four generals enter, with suonas. Feng Zhongyi enters. Han Shizhong enters, leading.) Serving as a marshal, the great general has awe-inspiring presence! (Entrance poem) Leading 30,000 soldiers, the ghosts and gods are amazed. Relying entirely on the heroes under my command, to sweep away the strong and violent. (Speaks) I am Han Shizhong, Deputy Envoy for Pacification of Fujian, Jiangxi, Jinghu. The Jin people have repeatedly invaded our territory. Fortunately, Yue Fei, Zhang Jun, Wu Jie, and Wu Lin have raised troops to fight. In recent years, the country has been roughly stabilized. Recently, I heard that Fan Ruwei has occupied Jianzhou and is plotting rebellion. The Emperor has ordered me to lead 30,000 troops to conquer him. Because Feng Zhongyi used to be a tax supervisor in Fuzhou and is familiar with the customs and sentiments of the Min region, I have specially appointed him as the Chief Commander in the army to accompany us on the expedition and assist in military affairs. All generals! (All respond: Yes!) March to Jianzhou! (Drums start, all exit)</p>
<p>Scene Five</p>
<p>(Young man enters) Though there are companions to play the Xiao, I have yet to achieve merit in seizing banners. (Followers enter) Reporting, Sir, I just heard from scouts that Han Shizhong is leading 30,000 troops to attack Jianzhou. They are not far from here, have set up camp, and are about to come! (Young man) Alas, wait! I think General Han's massive army pressing down is like Mount Tai crushing an egg. Fan Ruwei does not listen to my words and refuses to surrender. If I do not make plans for myself early, then at that time everything will be destroyed, wouldn't I be a fool to die under the blade, and leave behind the reputation of a traitor. What is to be done! Come, invite the lady! (Followers) Inviting the lady. (Exits) (Dan enters) What makes you so alarmed, my lord? (Young man) Alas, my lady, things are terrible! General Han Shizhong is leading 30,000 troops and will arrive soon. I think Fan Ruwei is no match for General Han. I have repeatedly advised Ruwei to surrender, but he refuses. If I surrender alone now, General Han will suspect me of treachery. Now that right and wrong are indistinguishable, what is to be done? (Dan) Has my lord forgotten? (Young man) I forgot. (Dan) When I first met you, my lord, I told you: if Ruwei does not listen to you, you should surrender to Yue Fei's army. You agreed, and you have often exhorted the brothers. Now is the time, why not take advantage of the army not yet arriving and sneak out of the city? If you are lucky enough to escape the city and can make contributions to the country, it would not be a waste of your seven-foot frame, and it would not be a waste of my marriage to you! (Sings) Your words are worth a thousand gold, I resolve to join Yue Fei's army. Take advantage of the chaos and military urgency, escape the net and run for a bright future. (Young man sings) Do not be angry, my lady, and listen to your husband's words. If I go to join the army alone, leaving my lady to suffer loneliness. When the government troops arrive, she will be bullied, how can I not shed tears! (Dan sings) Since I married you, I vow to be with you until the end, I am not afraid of the army killing into the city. If I am taken by the government troops, I would rather die under the blade than be unfaithful. If I can survive, I vow never to marry again! (Young man sings) Thank you for your firm loyalty, my death will also be with my eyes closed. If I make any progress here, I vow never to remarry to show my deep affection. My lady has given me all her kindness and righteousness, I can't bear to part with you! (Cries) (Dan sings) Do not weep, my lord, and be at ease about my affairs. The troops under General Han are all from the north, and I am also from the north. If our words match and we meet in a foreign land, how can there be no fellow feeling? Perhaps I will not die and will be able to see you again, to be intimate again under the flowers and moon! (Young man) My lady, even so, how can I bear to leave you? (Cries) (Moreover) My lord! (Sings) I entrust you with half of my mandarin duck mirror, each of us hiding half on our person. If there is a chance to meet again in the future, the broken mirror will be reunited and shine brightly. Take advantage of the fact that people are still unsettled, why not escape the city immediately? (Young man) Good, I'll go, I'll go, let's go! Alas! (With a crying voice) Let's go! (Looks at Dan) After thinking carefully, I still won't go! (Dan) You said you were going, why aren't you going again? (Young man) I can't bear to leave you! (Dan) Millions of lives all depend on your help. I am just one person, there are countless people in the country, for the country and for the family, which is more important, you should think twice. (Young man) There must be a plan that is satisfactory to both sides. (Dan) Good! (Makes a resolute gesture) You, a man, forget the hatred of the country, how can you be called a man! Enough! (Pulls out a sharp blade from her bosom) I will commit suicide to cut off your thoughts. (Young man snatches the knife) You don't have to do this, my lady, I'll go! (Dan steps forward to grab the knife) Are you going or not? (Young man) I'm going, I'm going! (Dan's angry expression turns into joy) That's more like it. (Young man) My lady! (Dan) My lord! (Wants to cry but holds back) (Young man) My lady! (Cries) (Dan) My lord! (Can't hold back, cries out loud, sings) Take care on the journey ahead, I will pray for your success day and night. After you kill the Jin soldiers and return, I will drink three cups to your heart's content! (Forcing a smile) Go! (Young man) Okay, I'll go. (Cuts and cries, feigning resolve) Be sure! (Exits, Dan covers her face and exits)</p>
<h3 id="e137">Impressions of "Suez" <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>20th Century Fox Production, Premiering at the Grand Theater</p>
<p>I will always remember Mr. Li Jianwu's words: "It is not easy to become a critic. At the very least, he must have the talent and knowledge to rival the author. And with something like drama, from the script to the stage to the audience, there is more than one author in the middle. To contend with a person versus a group of authors (if the author and the critic are really standing in opposition), it's really not easy."</p>
<p>What Mr. Li was talking about refers to drama. I think it is more appropriate to use it as a comment on movies. I quote it not because I want to evade responsibility, as if the writing of a bad movie review is a matter of course, no, not at all. I just want to use Mr. Li's words to explain that what I have always written is only "impressions after watching" rather than criticism. Of course, this is "blind men touching elephants," a "mechanized force." However, I think I should talk about the part that this blind man "touched." Perhaps there are audience members who "coincidentally" touched the same part as me and can use it to verify. Or, if other audience members touched different parts than me, I can let them know which part I touched. To be sure, falling into the eyes of experts who comprehensively grasp the overall situation, it is naturally strange and unpleasant. However, as a view from an audience member, it provides readers who want to watch the movie but haven't seen it a reference, and it gives those who have already watched it another verification. These kinds of post-viewing impressions cannot be considered completely superfluous.</p>
<p>For a film like "Suez," I can only be ashamed of my shortcomings. For example, regarding the history and geography of the Suez Canal, I know very little. And because of this, I am unable to explain whether the pioneer of Suez, Lesseps, was really the lover of a Spanish Countess and later had a confidante named Toni. However, I am an audience member who watched "Suez," and after watching it, of course, I have feelings. Having feelings, yet not knowing whether to advance or retreat, I still want to write it down, for no other reason than to provide those who have already watched it a verification (to see how much we differ) and to give those who have not watched it an additional reference.</p>
<p>In the film "Suez," the author treats Lesseps differently than the way they treat the "eternal" Pasteur who discovered microbes. The latter is to create a pictorial biography for him, while in "Suez," the author simply treats Lesseps as a character. His love affair on the screen may be true, but it is really like concocting a script that needs a love affair.</p>
<p>Speaking of the theme, yes, there is nothing bad to say about it, which is that a shrewd and capable person must experience great suffering and overcome great suffering in order to complete his career.</p>
<p>Indeed, the theme of "Suez" is not that simple. It also has, to some extent, the intention of creating a "separate biography" for Lesseps. Or, as the advertisement says, "What about leaning on green and snuggling up to red, affectionate? Who knows that death and separation are all in vain." It is almost like an American film, regretting that Mr. Lesseps' "death and separation are all in vain," and using this "tragic" theme to move the audience and satisfy the pocketbook. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chapter Five: Spring Arrives, Bixiao's Fragrance Floats on a Snowy Sea, Flowers Fly in Tiger Hill, Moon Full in Li Lake</p>
<p>Zhu Airen said, "How do you know they won't be going back for a while?" Wu Junsu said, "How could I not know? Sister Danyun told me. If there is a chance, Sister Danyun will accompany them to West Lake to play. Because Uncle He's job here probably won't let him go back for a while." Zhu Airen said, "That's great, we can go to various places to play at any time. Although the scenery of Suzhou is not as good as Hangzhou, Hangzhou is all concentrated on West Lake, but Suzhou is scattered in all directions, and each season has its own places to play. For example, in early spring, we go to Xuanmu to see plum blossoms, and in February and March, everyone goes to Zhizhuo Mountain for a spring outing. In the summer, we hire boats to Lotus Pond, and in the autumn, we go to Tianping to see the red leaves. Not only that, but my father has recently added many places to play, but unfortunately I am busy with medical work, and there are many places I have never been to. It's funny to say, I've only been to Tiger Hill once." Wu Junsu said, "That's right! Speaking of Tiger Hill, the two sisters can go and see it. It represents a kind of urban scenery of our Suzhou. You say it's a city? This Seven Mile Shantang, with green mountains and clear waters, mixed trees and flowers, does have a bit of mountain forest scenery. You say it's a mountain forest? The shops up and down the pond are lined up, and it's also a lively market. I heard that Tiger Hill is close to the city, and it doesn't look like Mount Zhu, so it's called Qiu. A hundred years ago, that place was very lively, but not as prosperous as it is now. Recently, in order to preserve the old city appearance, Tiger Hill Shantang is not allowed to build overly tall Western-style buildings, nor are large factories allowed to be built there. Even the buildings and pavilions must be Chinese-style. There are also some painted boats and lighted boats along Shantang, adorning the scenery of a Chinese Venice, so Europeans and Americans who come here often take many landscape photos to go back." Zhu Airen said, "Okay! Let's go to eat now, where to go? Sister Junsu! You are more familiar than me, my father wants to ask you to guide us." Junsu said, "There are two famous restaurants here. One is called Zunlu Residence, and the other is Shijia Restaurant. Both of these places are good to eat." He Liyu said, "I saw the name of this Shijia Restaurant in a notebook, and there is also something called Suzhou's famous Bafei Soup! So Shijia Restaurant is here." Zhu Airen said, "Since Sister Liyu has heard of it for a long time, let's go to Shijia Restaurant." Wu Junsu said, "This is a branch of Shijia Restaurant, and its old store is still at the original site. Shijia Restaurant is indispensable on the shores of Shihu Lake, Liyu wants to eat! Fei soup, maybe there will be some in these few days." So the four of them got up from Xianyun Water Pavilion and went to Shijia Restaurant. (58)</p>

<p>—About Huang Guiqiu's Supporting Roles</p>
<p>Huang Guiqiu's second performance at Tianchan invited Guan Shaohua, Du Fulong, Zhang Haichen, etc., all Northern actors, which gave the lineup a new look. However, Shaohua, Fulong, and others did not seem to be the best choices. (If Guiqiu's art of the old male role could invite Guan Dayuan or Xi Xiaobo, and the young male role could invite Gao Weilian or Chen Shengtai, there should be good results.) It is a pity that Guiqiu could not achieve the effect of green leaves setting off the peony.</p>
<p>Guan Shaohua is an amateur from the Beiping Public Leisure Gathering. He and Zhang Rennian, an amateur known for learning from Hou Xirui, are both employees of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. He went to sea as an actor three years ago. His art is not as good as Xi Xiaobo. Some say that Guan's art is based on Yan San (Jupeng), but after I listened to his singing, I can make an absolute judgment: Guan's singing has many Wang Shaolou components, and his recitation is similar to Ma Lianliang, without any Yan flavor at all. Guan's voice is acceptable, and his pitch is above six, but it is slightly to the left and has no standard pitch (that is, the quality of the voice and the pitch change at any time). In fact, his skills are still shallow. A few days ago, I watched him and Guiqiu perform Wujiapo and Dadengdian. His singing was quite skillful and pleasing to the ear. His body and stage steps failed to satisfy people. It is said that the Tianchan authorities originally intended to invite Chen Shaolin or Wang Wenyuan, but Chen and Wang were both far away in the Northeast. In desperation, Guan Shaohua was invited. In fact, the art of Chen and Wang is only slightly better than Guan. However, Chen and Wang's voices can be insured, and their acting seems to have a standard pitch, which is the so-called "non-wool origin after all."</p>
<p>Du Fulong is from Fuliancheng. He has been with Guiqiu for a long time and once followed Ma Lianliang. His art is mediocre, but his acting is quite decent. He has a solid foundation in both qualifications and experience. Although he is not as good as the rising stars Ye Shenglan and Gao Weilian, he is still a middle-class talent.</p>
<p>Zhang Haichen is the main painted face actor who came with Guiqiu to perform at Tianchan this time. He has never been seen in Pingjin. Perhaps he is a hero from the Northeast. His voice is quite strong, and his recitation has a bit of Hou Xirui flavor. That day, I watched him perform Tongtianxi. He actually had "a fragrant incense facing the sky" and "big top," which shows that Zhang's martial arts skills are quite solid. I initially thought that this person was a civil and martial arts rack painted face, but soon I saw in the Tianchan posters that Zhang's Caoxiao Pass play was a civil and martial arts rack painted face, and he also worked as a black head, which can be called civil and martial arts without blocking, and is absolutely rare. Therefore, in the current situation where there are few painted faces, Zhang Haichen is worth attracting the attention of audiences. However, Zhang's recitation has a lot of Shandong accent, which is a flaw.</p>
<p>As for Guiqiu himself, his voice is as sweet and bright as ever. His singing, recitation, acting, and expression can all be captivating. With Guiqiu's art, he is guaranteed to have a job in Shanghai, but the supporting roles must be paid attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Two Interesting Anecdotes About Xun Huisheng <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Master of the Plum Blossom Hall</p>
<p>Aunt - In the early summer of the eleventh year of the Republic [1922], Xun Huisheng, the master of Xiaoliuxiang Hall, was invited to come south. I, along with fellow writers Ni Ziqiao, Liu Gonglu, Shu Sheyu, and Liu Huogong, often visited his residence to chat and enjoy literary gatherings with wine, hardly a day passing without such an occasion. One day, Gonglu said to everyone present, "Life's gatherings and separations are impermanent. Why don't we take a photo together to commemorate this?" Sheyu said, "I suggest we take a photo in theatrical costume, capturing the essence of theatrical delight." Everyone agreed. So, it was decided that we would all meet at the Xin Xin Photo Studio on Nanjing Road the next day. When the time came, Ziqiao and Huogong couldn't make it due to other engagements. Thus, the four of us, including myself, took a group photo from the play "Spearing Mu the Dog King": Liuxiang played Mu Guiying; Gonglu played Yang Zongbao; Sheyu played Yang Yanzhao; and I played Mukua. After the photography was finished, Liuxiang laughed and said to me, "From now on, you will have to change how you address the master of our humble hall." I didn't understand what he meant and asked, "Change to what?" Liuxiang said, "From now on, I am your aunt. Are you still pretending to be clueless?" I said, "Okay, okay, I will address you as aunt." Gonglu said, "The aunt must give out a greeting gift; otherwise, it would be too cheap for the aunt." Everyone laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Nine Emperor Vegetarian Diet - One autumn, my sworn brother Xu Xiaolin and I represented the Gaoting Record Company to record music in Beijing. One day, Xun Huisheng was recording. He recorded four pieces: "Yutang Chun," "The Filial and Righteous Woman," "Mu the Dog King," and "Interrogating and Killing Tang." That day, Huisheng's voice was exceptionally good. The Erhuang opera reached above six and a half characters. After recording, Huisheng smiled and said to me, "These past few days, I've been eating the Nine Emperor Vegetarian Diet, so my voice is particularly good. This is your opportunity. In a few days, it will be worse." Hearing this, I was puzzled. I laughed and asked Huisheng, "What does eating vegetarian food have to do with your voice?" Huisheng said, "You silly man! Eating vegetarian food has nothing to do with your voice, but eating the Nine Emperor Vegetarian Diet has a lot to do with it!" I said, "After hearing these two sentences, I still don't understand. It's just like what Old Man Pan of Emerald Screen Mountain said: 'It's clearer if you don't say it; the more you explain, the more confusing it becomes.'" Huisheng said, "The Nine Emperor Vegetarian Festival (from the first to the ninth day of the ninth lunar month) is the most important taboo period for us in the acting world. During this taboo period, everything must be avoided, especially marital relations!" Only then did I suddenly understand and responded with a knowing smile. From then on, whenever Huisheng recorded, I would tease him by asking, "Have you been eating the Nine Emperor Vegetarian Diet?" Huisheng would always reply with, "Even if I don't want to, I have to." This question and answer became our secret code, the meaning of which was only known to those in the know, and the fun of it was precisely in the ignorance of outsiders.</p>
<h3 id="e141">About Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Danyun</p>
<p>Recently, Germany has been using various barbaric means to oppress Jewish people. At the same time, Chaplin has also announced that he will be filming a movie, tentatively titled "The Great Dictator." The screenplay is written by Chaplin himself, who also plays the main character, and it's entirely in sound. This is an unprecedented masterpiece for Chaplin. Chaplin himself plays two characters: one is a prisoner in a concentration camp, and the other is the dictator of a certain country. Chaplin himself is Jewish, so logically, it's obvious who the dictator he is referring to is. According to recent news from Hollywood, Chaplin is putting a lot of effort into filming this movie. He has his own studio, and the filming is taking place there. The actual work has already started.</p>
<p>According to Lives, the general manager of Chaplin's studio, officially announced, "Despite many rumors, the date for the start of filming this new movie has been set. In this film, Mr. Chaplin will not only maintain his usual style, but will also portray a character with a different personality. The Chaplin studio has expanded its facilities, added new equipment, and increased its staff to shoot this movie because there are many large crowd scenes. Negotiations are also underway to rent large tracts of land in San Fernando or other suitable locations for filming outdoor scenes."</p>
<p>In short, Chaplin is paying great attention to this movie. When it is released in the future, it will give the audience "a fresh experience."</p>

<h3 id="e143">Fumin Theater Actually Appears <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Daizi</p>
<p>Using film art to anesthetize the Chinese people is a well-established plan within the Japanese policy of military aggression. We only need to see that after the fall of the Northeast Provinces, movie theaters were controlled by the Japanese, and the films shown were almost entirely supplied by Japanese film companies. These films were nothing more than those containing political messages such as "Japan-Manchukuo-China Friendship," "Japan-Manchukuo-China Economic Cooperation," and "Joint Anti-Communism," which insidiously anesthetized the Chinese people. After August 13th [the start of the Battle of Shanghai], the areas under occupation were subject to control or strict censorship of films. The intentions are obvious.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, Japan is adopting its consistent policy and preparing to open a movie theater in the Hongkou area. This news has been circulating for a while, but it has recently become concrete. The theater is named Fumin Theater, and it is being established by the Japanese in Hongkou. It is scheduled to officially open tomorrow (the 13th). This theater is the original site of the Guangdong Grand Theater, with only minor repairs to the interior.</p>
<p>On the opening day, Japanese singers will perform various songs and dances, and Japanese waitresses from Hongkou will sing in chorus. According to their circulated news, many ignorant Chinese people and Japanese residents will attend the opening ceremony that day. It is expected that there will be as many as a thousand people, with free admission, which is of course to attract a large number of vagrants.</p>
<p>The Fumin Theater is under the Fumin Film Company established by the Japanese. Therefore, the films shown in the theater in the future will mostly be those produced in China by the Fumin Company. In addition to films, there will sometimes be performances of songs, dances, dramas, and other entertainment. According to Japanese claims, many Chinese stage actors, singers, and dancers have contracts with the Fumin Theater and will soon perform on stage. Whether this is true remains to be seen! Even if it is true, it will be nothing more than recruiting some degenerates from the entertainment world.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Postscript to the Lantern Festival Song Gathering <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Choucheng</p>
<p>Madam Xia Xunru, wife of Li Zuyu, along with Zhang Yuanhe, Wang Yijian, Ying Zhangli, Pan Nai Mao, and Pan Naiying, initiated a song gathering at the Lotte Hermitage during the Lantern Festival. They sang the complete "Palace of Eternal Life," with each guest taking on the role of Emperor Ming or Consort Yang. Starting from the scene of their courtship and continuing until the ballad, they sang more than a dozen scenes. Zhuang Yifu played Emperor Ming in the scene of the betrothal and bestowing of the box. This gentleman, who married Madam Wang Shuguang and Madam Wang Puzhen, wrote a legendary biography of ten years himself to record these events. He is known in the music circle for his romantic and suave style. He is well-versed in this opera. Paired with Xu Xiaoyin as Consort Yang and Feng Monong as the strongman, it was quite colorful. Both Xu and Feng are skilled in painting and calligraphy, talented and meticulous, proficient in all arts. Shen Shuying and Zheng Qicheng sang the "Wine Shop" scene together, one dignified and the other abruptly comical, both fitting the characters in the play. The "Floss Pavilion" scene was performed by Shen Hengyi as Emperor Ming and Madam Xiao Ming as Consort Yang. Both were veterans, evenly matched in skill. In the "Sudden Change and Burial of Jade" scene, Zhang Yingge played Consort Yang. He resembled Su Dongpo, with a full beard, but his voice was like a real Consort Yang, round and jade-like. This gentleman, who has long been nicknamed "Beauty Behind the Wall," gave an even more energetic performance that day. Everyone praised him as the "Bearded Consort Yang." When dying, he said to Chen Yuanli, "You do not direct your troops to the border enemies, but force me to kill myself." The resentment was palpable, and everyone was saddened. Gu Chuanjie's flute playing was even more commendable. Lotte Hermit and Zang Zibin sang the ballad together. The Hermit played Li Guinian and sang to the lines "Cannot finish singing of the ever-changing fortunes, cannot finish playing of the sad feelings and joys." The scene was so desolate and tragic that it was unbearable to listen to. Madam Xia Xunru and Miss Zhang Yuanhe sang the "Dish Washing" scene together, a perfect match, rare in the world. Entering the banquet hall at eight o'clock, the swapping of shoes was quite the fashion of the time.</p>

Unable to refuse, Mr. Xie announced that both sides would voluntarily hang up the chess pieces and perform. So, everyone held a hanging pole, concentrated on the large chessboard, and went up and down the board. Although they were extremely tired, they were grateful for the audience's enthusiastic welcome.</p>

<p>The Method of Using the Body</p>
<p>(B) The Position of the Body</p>
<p>The positions of the body are infinitely varied and difficult to express in words. For example, when doing the same trick, no two people's body movements are exactly alike. However, the position of the movements of each part of the body can be summarized into the following four styles:</p>
<p>Parallel: The guest shoulder, guest arm, guest leg, and guest hip are all in front, or all in back.</p>
<p>Reverse: The guest shoulder and guest arm are in front, and the guest leg and guest hip are in back, or the guest shoulder and guest arm are in back, and the guest leg and guest hip are in front.</p>
<p>Forward: The guest leg is in front of the main foot's toes.</p>
<p>Backward: The guest leg is behind the main foot's heel.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned various forward and backward, parallel and reverse movements can be further transformed into the following four styles:</p>
<p>(A) Backward Parallel: The guest leg is behind the main foot's heel, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are also in back.</p>
<p>(B) Forward Parallel: The guest leg is in front of the main foot's toes, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are also in front.</p>
<p>(C) Backward Reverse: The guest leg is behind the main foot's heel, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are in front.</p>
<p>(D) Forward Reverse: The guest leg is in front of the main foot's toes, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are in back.</p>
<p>In the first style of outside edge forward, the main shoulder is in front, and the guest shoulder and guest arm are as far back as possible. The guest leg and guest hip are in back. The line of sight is directed towards the main shoulder and the direction of movement.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the first style, which is also backward parallel.</p>
<p>The four styles mentioned above are closely related to the four edges mentioned below. Each edge of each foot has the main posture of these four styles. There are four kinds of edges, namely outside edge forward, inside edge forward, outside edge backward, and inside edge backward. The position of each edge of the body also has four styles: forward parallel, forward reverse, backward parallel, and backward reverse. Therefore, the left and right feet together can be transformed into thirty-two styles, that is, each foot has sixteen styles. The sixteen styles of the right foot are shown in the figure. The left foot can be inferred by analogy.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>"Lianhuan Tao" is a group performance in martial arts drama</p>
<p>Among all martial arts dramas, the group performance of sheng, jing, and chou roles with the best structure, the most complete pairing, the tightest stage arrangement, and the best intention is the complete "Lianhuan Tao." This play is divided into five major sections: the first focuses on "Dou Erdun Stealing the Horse," the second focuses on "Tiao Tianba Going to the Capital," the third focuses on "Tianba Visiting the Mountain," the fourth focuses on "Zhu Guangzu Stealing the Hook," and the fifth focuses on "Martial Arts Competition on the Mountain," persuading Dou Erdun to offer the imperial horse and go to the capital to file a lawsuit, which marks the end of the play.</p>
<p>Although this play is considered to have a martial sheng role as the protagonist, the supporting jing and martial chou roles are also very important. For example, "Stealing the Imperial Horse" is entirely a jing role's play, "Stealing the Double Hooks" is entirely a chou role's play, and "Visiting the Mountain" is equally important for both sheng and jing roles. The final scene seems to have more speaking and performing for the open-faced "martial chou." With such an arrangement and distribution in the play, is it not that the person writing the play does not have a martial arts role, or is it? Actually, not, because the martial sheng does have very exciting singing, acting, expressions, and dialogue when paying respects to Peng Zhongtang at the "Imperial Audience." All these must be displayed at this time. If a martial sheng with no foundation plays the role of Tianba, not only will his immature legwork and clumsy body be revealed when running around the stage, but also his voice, breath, and pronunciation can reveal whether he has put in the effort to study and has been guided by famous people in the "Reporting the Gate" scene, where he speaks a series of more than twenty words. Those who are experienced in appreciating opera can tell from these two aspects whether he can perform satisfactorily in the following parts and whether he is qualified to be the protagonist of this play. Therefore, Yang Xiaolou's performance can indeed be called a unique masterpiece throughout history. First, he can fit the role of a lieutenant general, and he can also show that Tianba is a small leader among his followers. Therefore, Zhu Guangzu, He Lutong, Ji Quan, Guan Tai, Jin Dali, and other heroes on both land and water all wholeheartedly support him without wavering. Even if Tianba is sometimes impulsive and offensive in his language, once explained, the friendship will return to the original state, and there is no grudge between the two sides. A group like them can exist permanently in society. The so-called co-existence and co-prosperity, pushing up a leader, will bring glory to everyone.</p>
