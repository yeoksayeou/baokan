<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國債信與英美利益</h3>
<p>中國財政部前天對於償仲債務辦法，聲明以關稅担保的債務，不再通融墊付償還，而僅願就戰區外各關稅收比例撥付。查中國政府的外債與賠欽，大部都是以關稅為担保；內債或以鹽稅為担保。或以統稅為担保。新發行的內外債則大多以直接稅中的所得稅等為擔保；而統一復興與金長諸債，亦以關稅為擔保。現在中國不再墊付關稅擔保外債，則對於英美的利益，當發生影響：另一方面似乎中國的債信亦發生問題。我們願就第三者的立場，作一番理智上底分析。</p>
<p>第一，以關稅為擔保的財政部經管外債（截止二十八年一月一日止）共有善役借欵·英德續借欵·中英庚欵。沙遜淮河借欵，此四種計英金二四·六一一，三六七鎊：及中法庚欵，中比庚欵·此二種計美金二五·五四六，〇○○元。可知關稅被日本刦持的結果·損失的是英美而不是中國，尤以英國的損害為最大。回憶一九三八年英國駐日大使克萊琪與日本外交次官堀內會商處置上海關稅問題，在五月三日締結關於中國關稅的英日協定中會規定：凡在日軍軍力控制下各海關稅收槪將存在橫濱正金銀行，由此存欵內將應償外債數額撥交總稅務司，履行以關稅為擔保的外債和賠欵底義務。可是事實上協定簽訂後祗償付善後借欵一百萬元·其他外債概未償付。當時英國既滿意於此種協定·以致中國雖經抗議而扔無法自由處置稅欵，則今日中國不再墊付關稅擔保之債務。動機雖不包涵抵抗的意義·但在法理上却不能不認為正當的。</p>
<p>第二，中國政府近年來對於外債信譽的維持·均曾盡最大的努力·如一九三六年十月對於費克斯飛機和馬可尼無綫電借欵的整理·一九三七年四月芝加哥銀行借欵和六月太平拓業公司借欵底先後訂定淸償辦法。指定鹽稅作為擔保。自中日戰爭發生後，戰區海關稅收，全部為日本刦奪勒存於日方銀行；以致戰區各關應攤而未解的債額·由中國政府轉商中央銀行墊付的積數，達一萬七千五百萬元之多，可見中國政府在戰時尚竭力維持債信。　旣在關稅被日本刦持而使中國無法履行償債，則本質上並非中國想賴債，亦即當然無墊付償還的義務。</p>
<p>第三、中國財部不再通融墊付關稅袒保債欵，並不是中國抗戰財政有什麼破綻·以致債信不維持。其出發點完全是一種自衛的經濟戰爭·避免日本以中國的財源·作侵略的工具：因之對於英美的利益，在一度盡力維持之後，不能再為維待英美利益而同時資敵。所以這是戰時必要的措施，原因不在財政。一九三八年九月中國因日本截期際戰區全部鹽稅，而將克利斯浦借欵和英法借欵還本部份暫行緩付，也是同樣的理由。</p>
<p>第四，中國財部雖不准再予通融墊付債欵，但對債信仍舊是竭力維持，以期英美的利益不受損害。在財部聲明中已明白宣稱，以後對海關擔保各項戰前訂借長期債務，按戰區外各海關稅收比例應攤數額，按期撥交中央銀行。設如戰區各關將已存欠繳應攤償賠欵·照舊解交總稅務司時，中國政府仍照舊撥付債欵基金·以恢復戰前原狀。所以英美不維護它在遠東的利益則已，假如眞具維護它在遠東的利益底决心·急應合作制裁日本，使得中國的關稅行政獨立完整和自由，間接亦即是使得本身的利益受到合理的維持和保障。</p>
<p>總之，中國此次對於關稅擔保債務不再墊付·並非航戰財政艱難而影響到債信的不能維持，占兀全是日本刦持海關稅收彼應有的結果·事實上無可非議的。我們僅希望英美各國為它本身利益·對於遠東大局能有更精細的分析，更深刻的認識，覺悟到它的債權因日本的侵略而發生危險。不再漠視，以更有効的辦法聯合制裁日本，而以極迅速的行動運行起來。固不僅它的價權——在中國的一切的利益都能得到合理的維護和保障！</p>
<h3>遠東權益受危害　民治國聯合應付　法將步英美後塵致牒日本　東京表示决貫澈基本政策</h3>
<p>（巴黎）關於華府九國公的應加以尊重事、美英兩國相繼向日本政府提出照會之後、外傳法國政府亦當在短時期內、向日本提出同樣照會、耍求尊重九國公約、並切實說明對華政策、此層頃由法國負責人士予以證實、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>據外人方面悄息、杭州近郊之游擊戰、近來益見積極，華軍已由錢塘任渡江、而達海鹽一帶、其數當在八千人以上、此數卽日軍發言人、亦已承認之、但該發言人對於前方之戰事消息、尚譚言不知、此益可蹬明華軍游擊隊大勝之電訊、固非虛傳也，</p>
<p>蘇州方面　日軍重創</p>
<p>又聞在蘇州方面、去冬中國游擊隊與日軍之接戰、大小達三百零九次、日軍損失重大、死亡共達四千五百零五人、而華軍方面、奪獲之戰利品、為數亦甚可觀、計有步槍一千四百四十二枝、子彈三十二萬八千蝕位、機關搶七十架、並有汽船一艘云、</p>
<p>逼郊日軍　紛調杭嘉</p>
<p>杭垠之情形、各方盛傳極為緊張，證之上海近郊一帶情形觀察、亦殊可信、據熱悉近郊情形之華人方面消息、上海四年郊之日軍、日來大量減少、大部均被調赴杭嘉一帶、現馳海近郊之日軍。為數甚少、如滬西沿滬杭鐵路與滬杭公路交文點之上海中學、原為日軍滬西之重要據點，平常該校所駐日軍、常在五百名以上、多至一二千各、近僅存不足百宅、龍華亦僅百餘人、虹橋援傷祇有二十餘名、北新涇亦僅數十名而巳、管轄滬郊一帶防務之林肯路日司令部、連同豐田之日軍、亦不址三百名、防務空虛、實為國軍退出大上海後所未有現蒙、因此邇來滬西之灘擊隊、極為活躍、至於濾東方面、日陸軍亦大量減少、其防務多由日海軍驢鴃獸接響矣、現近郊之日軍兵力激誡、因之多死守據地、不敢外出、以防游擊隊之襲襲、</p>

<p>近日產地各路米糧價杵高漲後、一般販運客商行號、不敢多進、恐邇滬後反遭虧損、同時日為增收非伙稅捐、更使師販負擔加重、基此種種原因、到滬米糧、遽然停滯、現每日由內地運滬之米糧、僅四五千包、而滬埠日銷數、的佔一萬餘包、交易不數牛數、所以市編連期開盤時米價絢飛漲、服上星期成交市價增加六七角、最好白授將近十三元、中决各號秈極、物已浴階十二元外、</p>

<p>上海非正式之證券交易市傷、因財政部通告關稅祖保之憤券、不再通融透支後、前日統一公債各毬債票、一致在跌、昨日市饗上因盛傳本月底到期統一公債、央照常付欽、且重慶付息、並非愆期、以放債市稍見襯定、下跌不滿一元、收槃甲磁五十五元八角、較前日跌七角、乙種四十九元五角、較玆日跌五角、丙讖四十八元八角、較前日跌二角、丁種四十八元、較前日跌五角、戊種四十八元三角、絞前日跌三角、</p>
<h3>日偽謀操縱工運失敗後　野心未戢仍圖活動</h3>
<p>又用汪精衛名義四出拉攏　各工會發表宣言不受蠱惑</p>
<p>日偽方耐、企圖操縱滬市工運、會組織「中華工人顯益會」驕致各業工會加入、但遭嚴拒、教會務無法擴展、日方已停給津貼、工作業陷停頓、詛連日該會若干份子、又四山活動、謂係受在精衛委託、在滬成立工運機關、響應和平運動、本市各業工會、昨特發表宜言、聲明嚴正守楊、始終不受誘惑、茲經現代計肥者探誌各惰如下、</p>
<p>偽福益會　工作停頓</p>
<p>日偽主持之偽「中華工人福益會」、由偽「社會周長」胡壽昌任侖長、幃人林瓷炯任秘書長、日人宮田九昇為指導員、自去年實告「成立」以來、即以州救濟失業」為號召、誘致各業工會合作、但各工會負責人、均深明大義、嚴予拒絕，致賅會無奈、遂拉攏若干失業份子、捏造工會名稱、實行自拉自唱、至於實際則完全空洞無力、胡壽昌　林齊炯。等竟以此向日方騙領鉅額經費、旋日方偵悉前情、即將律貼停止、該會以經餐無滿、江柞遂陷於無形停頓、</p>

<h3>租界地產交易　西區小地產較活潑　中區·地產依然呆滯　投資目的亦與前不同</h3>
<p>上海爲世界十大商埠之一、亦爲東亞最重要口岸、因政治上經濟上種種特殊關係、養成其特殊性質、促進其特殊發展、從而造成其特殊地位、開埠九十餘年來、人口日增、地價飛漲、在昔每畝市價僅制錢十五千文至三十五十千文者、後竟有漲至每畝値五十萬者、過去爲金融界押款、及投資之重要目的物、惟自「一二八」事變以後、確有極顯著之减退、而以向稱繁盛之公共租界、由爲顯著、自「八一三」</p>
<p>戰事發生</p>
<p>後、內地人士、紛紛避難來滬並以虹口區域、迄未開放、聞北南市、都變灰燼、以致租界安全區域內、人口之擁齊、逈異尋常、即越界築路在鐵路綫以東者、亦復租居一空、因此多年不景氣之上海地產、又呈活躍之象、惟戰後之地產復活性質、與以前地產之景氣</p>
<p>在有區別</p>
<p>以前地價升漲時、一般投資人士、無不樂於購置、向行莊商做押款、亦甚便利、故地產成交甚易、每月恒在千萬元左右、且地產愈大、位置愈佳者、則愈見其珍貴、戰後地產活動、則反其道而行之、一般人士、所以購置地產、無非爲住居及建築廠房之用、故法租界及西區之小地產面積在一二畝左右、兼有住宅等建築物者、</p>
<p>成交特多</p>
<p>此外宜昌路小沙渡路戈登路一帶、可造廠房之地段、亦有若干交易、其價値大致與工部局估價相近、佳者的高二三成、每月成交額、在戰事初起之四個月、為數極少、綠當時四郊有激烈之戰事、租界以內、人心不定、尙無暇顧及地產交易、自去年五月以後、漸見熱鬧、平均每月</p>
<p>約有百萬</p>
<p>元之成交、惟此種交易、多屬西區及小額地產、至於中區地產、活動甚少、且價格依然低跌、未見升漲、例如最近漢口路有地皮二畝三分餘、照工部局估價、應爲二十八萬七千餘兩、合現幣四十萬元之譜、而最近賣出、僅爲二十九萬元、且連房屋在內、照工部局估價、打</p>
<p>七折不足</p>
<p>又如靜安寺路有地五畝一分餘、照工部局估價爲四十一萬餘兩、合現幣五十八萬元以上、而成交價（去年夏間）僅爲四十八萬元、且連極佳之房屋在內、亦不過照估價打七折、此外河南路有某大地產、最近願照工部局估價打對折出售、聞尙未覓得成主、可見上海地產之活躍、僅</p>
<p>限於西區</p>
<p>及小地段方面尙未能視爲普遍的景氣也、緣上海目下地位、有繫於國際情勢者甚大、萬一世界大戰發生、能吾不影響上海、殊少把握、而英美與日感情日劣、對於上海情勢有無關係、亦在未定之局、同時一般人士、對於</p>
<p>法幣價值</p>
<p>當初雖不免懷疑、目下經政府努力維持後、價值日見穩定、信仰有加、亦不願大規模投入地產中、以致資金呆滯、因此上海地產市面、欲恢復過去之繁榮、恐仍須相當時日、並非短時期間所能實現者也、</p>

<h3>孤軍薪餉問題　謝晉元嚴正表示　全體將士已有聲明發表　一切賬冊由會計師審查</h3>
<p>（本報專訪）四行忠勇孤軍，自移駐膠州公園以來，各界對其近况均極關懷。本報記者，昨日晤見孤軍團附謝晋元氏，與談各情甚詳，茲誌如次：</p>
<p>記者咋晤謝氏於寓處，謝氏英姿依然，惟近因失眠，略現消瘦，衣國產呢之藍色西裝，整潔端莊。室中陳設，簡單撲素，案頭置不少書籍。謝氏初習工業，繼在黃埔學校研究政治，嗣入軍隊，對於各項事務，渠均載諸日記，其個人生活，規律甚嚴，烟酒之類，向所屏絕，態度誠懇而嚴肅。</p>
<p>謝氏首述其個人近患失眠症，經延醫檢查，尙未能完全探得其病源，惟自審殆屬精神上之剌激過深所致，蓋因所部自四行撤退以來，承舉國人士之愛護與策勉，至爲感激，惟念軍人天職，在保國衛民，當此抗戰進行中，而所部未能爲國家民族繼續効力，滋深不安。現時全體士兵，身處孤島，心繫國家，其熱烈情緒，無由發揮，精神上之苦悶，不獨本人爲然；即全營士兵，均具同感。在此現狀下，士兵均能明瞭環境，切實從事於研究學術，鍜鍊體格，以為將來報國之用。</p>
<p>謝氏旅述當所部在四行抗戰之時，渠以四晝夜不眠，應付一切，其時情緒之緊張，祇知此身業已許國，粉身碎骨，在所不惜。厥後奉命撤退，全體士兵，突圍而出，乃犧牲之少出乎意料，即受傷之排長，雖在槍林彈雨之中，亦由士兵抬出，此亦由士兵之咸能曉然於革命軍人之大義，故能歷險如夷。謝氏語至此，其情緒至爲興奮而又極感傷，並謂一年以來，本人凡與各方折衝，堅守國家民族之立塲，期以母負舉國人士熱烈之期望。</p>
<p>關於日前某報所載孤軍薪餉問題之外界投函，謝氏亦會提及，謂此事日昨孤軍將士業已發表聲明。本入茲可言者，即孤軍一切帳冊，均由會計師負責審查，報吿關係各方，所有給養，謬承地方人士之協助，惟以旣末備有的款，自不免常在籌維應付之中。孤軍士兵，深明大義，故給養雖有時感覺艱困，然相處一室，融洽異常，士兵官長，無事不談，對於目前之處境，給養之籌劃，均能深切瞭解。另悉，關於孤軍給養問題，現正由關係各方面，商洽切實辦法，各方入士爲愛護忠勇壯士，仍在繼續設法，預料短期內或可獲得解决</p>
<p>新聲社云：自前日報載孤軍薪餉問題以後，孤軍將七當以世項記戰易滋誤會，業經以全體孤軍士名義，發表重要聲明，對謝團長剛介正直，涓滴入公，共矢信仰。新聲社記者昨於便中適晤謝團長，謝氏對於此事叙述甚詳言詞間對軍人人格，民族令譽，其一種熱切情諸，令人敬佩。謝氏幷云，孩軍前後所領薪餉給養，均有詳細帳冊，由會計師審查，送報關係方面。至孤軍給養之艱困，亦屬事實，歷承地方人士之愛護協助，得以勉資應付；而全營士兵朝夕一室，無話不談，對於目前處境，均能深切瞭解。淮以覊旅孤島，未能繼續爲國効力，致精神上殊感痛苦。謝氏末謂本人乃一軍人，一切悉秉過去精神，期以發揚孤軍以往之光榮歷史，母負舉國人士之期望。</p>
<p>上海特輯</p>
<h3>戰時之上海郵政（續）不典</h3>
<p>各區員工之撤集</p>
<p>上海華軍西撤後，沿交通綫各地，相繼淪陷，蘇浙皖三區管理下之吳縣，鎭江，江陰，南京，安慶等局之員工，先後集中上海，杭州則撤至麗水。同時，上海管理局局長法人乍配林氏，奉部令，委爲蘇浙皖三區總稽　員，兼理各該區事務。</p>
<p>遷回員工之撤集</p>
<p>戰事西移，上海環境，益形特殊，而日人加諸郵政之壓力，亦愈見重迫，首先，即為逼令遷回原址，經乍配林氏數度折衝，仍屬無效，直至二十七年三月六日，乃由愚園路臨時局所，遷回北四川路原址，繼續辦公。</p>
<p>日籍檢查之駐人</p>
<p>郵局函件，向由黨部派員檢查，日軍乃亦援例要求，于郵局遷回原址後，即派駐日籍檢查員二十二名，開始活動，自是以後，舉凡封發，投遞，掛號，快遞，印刷，聯郵各重要部門，皆有若輩踪迹，每日被扣郵件，不下數萬件，而由以印刷物爲最多，雖中立圖書雜誌，亦遭同等命運，本市著名西書店如別發，中美圖書公司，大華雜誌公司等，概未倖免。每週甩卡車由郵局運往虹口之被扣郵件，常達三四十袋之多。最近，復藉口防止軍需品之輸入內地，沿京滬，滬杭一帶之包裹，亦被蹂躪。</p>
<p>多用日籍郵員</p>
<p>當郵權收回之時，各國書信館人員，多有隨入郵局，繼續服務者，故郵局向有客籍職員。上海區本有日籍職員兩人，至是，乃分別升爲局長帮辦與總巡查員，幷起用業經吿退之日籍職員一人。同時，于二十七年六月間招考日文通譯十餘人，其理由爲『業務需要』云。</p>
<p>停售印花稅</p>
<p>印花稅本由郵局代售，自偽『統稅局』成立後，日方即　逼郵局，停止發買，改售僞『統稅局』之印花稅。郵局佈吿于二十七年六月十三日起，停止代售一切稅票。</p>
<p>開闢京滬及日本航空郵路　郵局自上</p>
<h3>棉麥到期借欵　日方狂妄聲明　對償還事不予同意　關稅欵項仍圖把持</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日大使館發言人昨（十六日）在招待記者席上答覆問話云、一九三五年美國棉麥借款的百分之五之到期款項償還事、日方常局不予同意、關於以關稅作抵之借款情况、仍未變更、至於以目下存橫濱正金銀行之款項中、可能償還以關稅作抵之借款者、其先决條件、乃爲中國海關履行一九三八年五月三日英日恊定中所規定之全部條件、海環境下轉後，自上海至內地之直接航空郵路，皆已停頓。最近反添設上海至南京及上海至日本之航空郵路，此舉雖無若何意義，然亦可見遷就之一斑。</p>
<p>恢復戰區業務</p>
<p>郵局今日工作之最為外界所注意者，即為對於戰區業務恢復之努力。計自二十七年三月份起，復局消息，日有露佈，計：</p>
<p>三月份：六合，鎭江，溧水，湖熟，浦鎭，高淳，武進等。</p>
<p>四月份：南京等。</p>
<p>五月份：吳縣，高資，大橋等。</p>
<p>六月份：無錫，丹陽，龍潭等。</p>
<p>七月份：金壇，新豐等。</p>
<p>上海區：大塲，嘉定等。</p>
<p>八月份：蚌埠，杭州，開封等。</p>
<p>九月份：上海區：南翔，松江，崑山等。</p>
<p>十月份：安徽各局及上海區之黃渡。</p>
<p>十一月份：嘉興，江陰等。</p>
<p>十二月份：吳淞，寳山，楓涇等。</p>
<p>上列各地，雖多非上海區所管轄，然目前則皆在上海局局長指揮之下，而以上海爲復局之權紐，故亦不能不加以注意，至於本市各支局，目下除南市外灘，裹馬路，大南門，龍華，高昌廟，中山路，老北門，北四川路，西華德路，聞北，保定路等十一局暫停外，其他如畫錦路，西門，爛泥渡，北站，提籃橋等，皆已復局，至於有恒路郵局，自戰事起後，即遴派日文郵員，前往服務，迄今未停。</p>
<p>業務之理狀</p>
<p>戰事爆發前，郵局營業，每日平均的八九萬元，戰後即一落千丈，當廣州漢口未失陷前，因包裹營業，特殊發展，會一度進至每日六七萬元，今則僅兩萬左右矣。郵政經濟收入，戰前向由郵政儲金匯業局轉存中央銀行，今聞已改存外商（英法兩國）銀行，其能免於海關之覆轍，亦云幸矣。其他可以縷述者，爲：</p>
<p>（甲）航空郵綫之更改上海直接航郵，除南京與日本外，餘均停頓。西南各省航空路綫，經中國及歐亞兩航空公司添設，計共有：</p>
<p>宜渝錢—宜昌，萬縣，重慶。</p>
<p>渝蓉錢—重慶，成都。</p>
<p>渝昆綫—重慶，昆明。</p>
<p>渝嘉綫—重慶，瀘州，叙府，嘉定。</p>
<p>歐亞綫—經桂林重慶昆明成都，漢中，西安，蘭州，寗夏等地。</p>
<p>惟自上海至各地之郵件，則均須先寄香港，由香港—重慶航空錢飛機轉去。</p>
<p>（乙）汽車運輸損失費之徵收　郵局目下賴以維持交通者，多為公路之汽車，費用昂貴，因此，舉凡書籍，印刷物，貿易契，貨樣等重件，概須徵收汽車運輸損失費，計：</p>
<p>省內　每公斤或畸零之數：二角。</p>
<p>各省每公斤或畸零之數。四角。</p>
<p>（內）匯票費之增加匯票費因補水費關係，亦經增加，惟各地不一。</p>
<p>其他如包裹及印刷物之交寄，因環境關係，隨時變動，本文亦不能作較爲固定之報吿。（完）</p>

<h3>郵滙局再減　平津滙費　每元減收三分　匯額限五十元</h3>
<p>上海郵政儲金滙業局、前曾規定於本年一月一日起、凡開發匯票至天津·北平·兩地者、每元滙費自二十分、减收七分、茲據新聲社記者、向上海郵政儲金匯業局探悉、該局爲使各界减輕匯費及便利起見、决繼續减低北平·天津·兩地滙費、每元自七分减至三分、此項規定、業已實行、惟其匯額、仍以五十元爲限、又南京·杭州·浙東·各縣、及濟南等處、匯款至天津·北平·者、亦照上海同樣辦理、</p>
<h3>二十七年總結束期　各業開始準備　錢業將開會議辦法</h3>
<p>上海錢業公會議決、二月十八日為民國二十七年總結束期、各業監於總結束期將屆、業已開始準備、對放出之貨款、均已設法催取、同時調度頭寸、以便安渡、在此總結束期將近之時、上海金融市塲、甚為穩定、國貨工廠、均有畸形之發展、又錢業公會定本月二十五日舉行執行委員會例會時、提出討論總結束前後準備事宜、</p>

<p>本市場虎車業互助會、昨致函公共租界納稅華人會、請再函工部局抗議截柄改輪、略謂本會前以工部局不合物理、截短老虎車柄，影響會員生計、曾於去年十二月十三日、致函該局、力陳車柄不可截短之原因、請予仍准照常使用、並由今後製造新車、由該局規定式樣、逐漸改善、以維苦力生計、並經函請貴會援助各在案、迄已逾月、該局不惟置不答復、且除截短車柄外、復迫使改裝二英寸闊鐵輪邊、致日來會員車輛、不獲捐照營業、引起悲慘恐慌、紛紛到會、環請</p>
<p>設法救濟</p>

<h3>政界人物眷屬　竟然虐待養女</h3>
<p>太太深夜出去义麻雀　囑養女連珍守候開門　稍不隨心竟加以毒打　本案法院不日將審理</p>
<p>中華慈幼協會上海辦事處、於本月十四日接得付義人士報吿、謂居住戈登路三六三弄六十號之梁太太、有虐待養女之行爲、請速加救濟等語、該辦事處當派幹事劉文林·夏時等、於是日下午、前往梁宅調查、抵達時、梁太太適出外又麻雀、其親生女及養女連珍皆在家、詳細加以詢問、該梁氏親生女已十六歲、在某校初中讀書、窺其語氣、對於該養女極表不滿、曾謂我媽於某晚</p>
<p>出個义麻雀</p>
<p>到十一時方歸、本來呌連珍等候開門、誰知她生性懶惰、不等媽回來、她就睡着了、這樣的人、自然該打一、言談之頃、該親生女面目、頗表露兇狠氣燄、繼詢問養女連珍、知其年齡爲十一歲、又問何故遭母親毆打、其先不肯說、因開導再三、連珍乃放聲哭訴、謂於前年五月間、在南京離開自己的家、由一個不大認識的人、把我送到梁太太家中當養女、我的</p>
<p>親爸爸姓張</p>
<p>媽媽也唸過書、在自己家中、有一個姐姐、四個妹妹、我爸爸　不是討厭因爲女孩子太多、把我賣給梁太太當丫頭、我並不知道、在這裏一切的事情、都要我一個人做、若偶然做錯了一點、阿姐就把我扭倒、拿手巾蓋住我的嘴、由母親用拳頭打我、或者用手指頭掐我、我</p>
<p>身上的傷痕</p>
<p>總是道邊才好了、那邊就又要添上一塊、如今我大腿上還有一塊傷痕、剛才你們二位先生來的時候、我正是在樓下燒水、給阿姐洗脚、現在的母親喜歡又麻雀、有的時候、還要玩回力球、我得時常給她守門、不能安睡、連珍述至此處、將右面大腿裸露、其內面果有一大塊傷痕、</p>
<p>顯出紫黑色</p>
<p>慈幼協會所派出幹事、見此情形、認爲梁太太之虐待義女、已有事實證明、且該氏親生女亦協同虐待、同是孤島上中國人、爲何竟如此殘害本國人、此外、該梁氏之丈夫、現在重慶供職、究竟其家庭在前年五月間、將連珍接來時、共果爲領養之性質耶、抑爲購女</p>
<p>作婢之性質</p>
<p>耶、旣然名義爲一事、實際爲另一事、自然有請求警政及司法機關加以澈底處理之必要、該幹事等遂立即報舍戈登路捕房、由朱探長將該養女連珍救出、暫送濟良所、等待特區法院提訊案犯、宜佈開審，同時據劉文林幹事談、對於梁太太虐待養女、本人深表惋惜、按尊重兒童福利、曁禁止蓄奴養婢之命令、政府早有頒布、吾人甚望</p>
<p>官吏之眷屬</p>
<p>當率先並切實遵守政府所頒布之命令、特區法院不日將審理本案、吾人盼虐待養女者、必能獲得敎訓、同時該女童連珍之前途幸福、亦必能護得切實之保障、</p>

<h3>劵　英倫譯劵市場掀起空前跌風　關稅担保之外債各跌五鎊</h3>
<p>其餘各種外債跌四鎊乃至一鎊半　內債人心猶在搖曳不定行巿仍小</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月十六日（星期一）掛牌行市、適值財政部通吿海關稅担保各債、如到期基金不敷、不再由政府准予通融透支墊付之聲明到達倫敦、頓發生空前之影響、凡以海關稅及庚子賠款担保之債券曁英德借款及道淸鐵路公債均各猛跌五鎊、其餘亦隨落一鎊半至四鎊不等、一律跌至老價、市面亦陷於停頓、計英德續借款英發債票等五種、各跌五鎊、英德續借款英發債票現價爲七十一鎊、中法美金公債有印債票除息後新價爲六十八鎊半、（較上週末跌七鎊半、除利息二鎊半、實跌五鎊、）英法借款英發債票價爲五十鎊、善後公債英發債票價爲四十七鎊道淸鐵路公債價爲二十一鎊、京滬鐵路公債跌落四鎊、價爲廿鎊、津浦鐵路原續發各債票均跌三鎊半、價爲十二鎊半、克利斯浦公債等三種、各跌三鎊、克利斯浦公債價爲三十二鎊、湖廣鐵路公債非德發債票價爲二十鎊、隴海鐵路公債價爲十一鎊、費克期飛機債票及湖廣鐵路公債德發債票各跌二鎊、前者價爲十一鎊、後者價爲十八鎊、廣九鐵路公債跌落一鎊半、價爲十七鎊、倫敦實貨供給仍付缺如、惟於英金善後公債尚有進胃、計買進英金善後公債俄發無印債票五千鎊、出價三十六鎊、又買進法發有印債票一千鎊、出價四十二鎊、又二千五百鎊、出價四十二鎊半比上週末挫落六鎊至五鎊半、又如英德續借款債票，亦有五千鎊去胃、出價七十鎊半、照市抑半鎊、然買方雖有問津、但因市價跌落過甚、未必能如願購得云、</p>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况初有轉風、以改付匯劃消息、忽又有扣除滙費等傳言、致正在回蘇之債市、又受打擊、據昨日報載、上海雖可代領、但需扣去由川至滬之滙費或分期六個月支付、在財部通吿中、更有此次一月底到期之統一公債還本付息、因已抽籤、並已在中央銀行透支墊付之一萬七千五百寓元之內、故决准其償付、傳說紛紜、莫衷一是、在未經正式揭示前、震盪情形、在所不免、綜上項各說、暹輯言之、有二點、一爲此次到期應還之本息、除所得稅外、額外損失百分之十五、一爲此次到期本息償淸後、第七期息是吾着實、在目下報載之通吿中、頗有絃外之音、遂引起一般人甚大懷疑、因此昨日應有之漲風、再遭頓挫、惟旣付滙劃、則不應扣付匯費、旣扣匯費、則當付給法幣、此二說有一於此、則皆不可通、分期辦法、則銀行手續過於麻煩、恐政府亦未必採此方法、若付法幣、則又與獨停外漬相衝突、故此種之傳說、均未必即能買現、總之、公債本息、發生問題、已爲不可諱之事實、惟爲持票人損失之大小問題耳、　上午初開時、大戶顧某及十一號奮勇吸收、比之前日價已好起一元至一元半、正在欣欣向榮之際、而大部散戶及協大以及三十五號仍紛起求售、市上頓感供過於求、價乃逐漸下降、市價愈小、賣風愈盛、上午結果、祇甲戊兩種微好五分三角、餘則尚小去五分至二角、下午情形愈見紊亂、協大及三十五號仍有賣出、大都爲隔日之多頭出籠、二十號獨賣甲種、市上恐慌情形、依然未見减退、買進方面、祇有恒德號胃量較鉅、餘則均不見踴躍、形勢異常紊亂、足以見人心恍惚不寗、惟一般人心思、政府對於內債、必然儘力維護、賣戶之自起紛擾、終不免貽庸人自擾之譏耳、在正式辦法未經詳細佈吿後、市面尚不易安定、市價結果比之前日竟續小二角半至八角不等、成交總數的計一百三十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易淸淡如故、祇中國銀行股成交少數、價爲五十七兀云、</p>
<h3>金融　港方轉賣爲買　滙市頓起風波</h3>
<p>美金一度至十六元　沙遜拋塞略形回鬆</p>
<p>滙市昨以外電香港已止塞轉扒、兼華商如紗花帮等吸收亦勁、並洋行結款仍盛、風波劇烈潛勢續緊、英金劇緊至八辦士二一八七五、美滙幾破十六元關、港滙亦至五十五元二五、終賴沙遜起而傾售、略形回鬆、當日成交依然旺盛、</p>
<p>晨初以倫教大條近遠皆縮、紐的現貨不動、倫敦生金又縮一辦士、匯兌英對美大〇六、對法小十二生丁、對滬如舊、美對英降一八七五、對法跌〇六二五、對滬小七分、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行早開現貨賣價英匯八辦士三二八一二五、美滙爲十六元二一八七五、較前收英緊〇一五六二五、美　〇三一二五、開後港電　然止售、轉向猛扒、加以洋行亦起購結、致潛勢步緊、美金立軟至十六元二一八七五、英金僅結八辦士三一二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅公佈價小七五、此後華商如紗花帮等競吸頗勁、而銀行供意甚呆、吃胃則較强、故過程愈形軟化、英金直軟至八辦士二一八七五、華行互做十六元一二五倏、美金軟至大通出紗花帮僅十六元、將近午時、沙遜突然起而傾售、且銀行納量不旺、於是爲狀稍轉鬆動、沙遜塞予有利二月份價十五元八七五、午刻又　出現貨英金八辦士二八一二五、及美金十六元一二五、午收續鬆至英金八辦士二八一二五可結，美金十六元一五六二五、港匯聲動亦烈、洋商銀行界力吸、一度步緊、由五十五元七五直軟至五元二五、後賴錢兌業湧騫漸形回硬至五元半、</p>
<p>後市洋行界結款又盛、故潛勢復緊、終以沙遜再起說售、及銀行買胃不暢、重轉平穩、某英行八辦士二九六八七五肯售、美金須十六元一八七五方可脫手、至港匯仍由緊後漸轉鬆濫、賤至五十五元六二五、延至晚收銀行賣價英匯八辦士二九六八七五、美匯十六元一五六二五、結果比前收英續軟〇四六八七五、美又緊〇九三七五、港軋緊半元、</p>
<h3>劃頭亦加八交換　一月十六日起實行</h3>
<p>本來票據交換、以滙劃票爲限、乃自本年一月十六日起、所有劃頭票據亦一律加入交換、先解入錢業準備庫、發給知單、再行軋帳云、</p>
<h3>港帮與殷戶買意復萌　現金價再度上騰　昨到二〇二七元　結果又漲起十元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤盤市况、慶積上升、然中途起落靡常、大致由漲而跌、終復再升、蓋全視買賣勢爲轉移、初內承上日之餘風、再聞外滙受香港曁洋行及投機家等猛扒趨緊、加以久未思動之港帮、亦大量吸購、致晨開即達二千零二十元關外、後因外滙止緊轉鬆、一時買風頓戢、但金號曁證券帮等爭前拋售、故乃稍挫、卒因港帮買意復萌、致價重復上騰、以當天之最高峯收盤、唯其中頗多盤旋、然尚無過大波瀾、各方人心堅穩、交易上午尚旺、下午則轉淸淡、銀樓飾金傍晚亦掛大一元、海關金曁中英純金等繼續微降、</p>
<p>烚赤在最高峯收盤</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開堅昂、因承上日餘勢、且外滙亦逐步軟化、加以港帮買童甚濃、聞買方先喊二千零三十元買進、售者喊三十五元、嗣後某現余號忽來拋塞、而進者反束手旁觀、因之價格重復喊低十元光景、始見現金號售予某錢兌業五十兩、二千零二十二元爲開盤價、繼之某錢兌業又進現金號五十兩、價二十四元、再進銀樓帮五十兩、價二十五元、及金號五十兩、價二十四元、（聞進者均代港帮）、後金號又來拋售、且同時證券帮亦有賣意、後乃稍挫、金號售予錢兌業五十兩、價二十三元、證券帮售予錢兌業五十兩、價二十二元、其間某銀樓亦忽代本地殷富吸收、故又抬高數元、某銀樓進同業五十兩、價二十五元、及錢兌業五十兩、價二十四元、此後外匯止緊轉鬆、故父下挫、喊低至二十元光景、仍難找進者、此時忽見港帮冉託某錢兌業趁低猛進、故價再復上騰、進金號白兩、價二十一元、某銀樓進錢兌業五十兩、價二十四元、某錢兌業又進銀樓帮五十兩、價二十五元、再進金號五十兩、價二十七元、最後錢兌業進金號五十兩、二十五元爲午收價、午後因外匯甚平、故漲落及交易同時俱减、二時三刻首見錢兌業進金號五十兩、價二十五元、後又進同業五十兩、價則相同、此後供求益稀、直至四時後又見錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、二千零二十七元爲晚收價、較上日軋漲十元、（已連漲三天共計三十二元）、現金號之本牌金售出價二千零三十五兀、收進二千零二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金傍晚掛大一元</p>
<p>銀據首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至傍晚四點十五分、因烚赤甚形堅穩、故而掛大一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百零六元、新同行懸二百零四元、收進一百九十八元、</p>
<p>英純金再縮一辦士</p>
<p>十六日倫敦電、英純金續縮一辦士、計退達七鎊八先令八辦士半、致中央銀行之中國純金（烚赤）收買價亦降低至一千二百十四元、掛牌海關金亦跌二釐、計二元三角九分九釐、上海標準標金價亦隨降六角、計一千二百零九元三角、</p>
<h3>外幣亦不乏收藏</h3>
<p>昨日英純金續跌一辦士、英美滙兌續升一八七五、外滙因人心緊張、開盤甚弱、嗣後外電供給爽暢、雖需要殷切尚供過於求、市價鬆動、惟較前晚爲緊耳、烚赤開盤即呈高峯、雖銀樓帮金號等、趁高價塞出、惟殷富吸納甚殷、廣帮搜羅不懈、市價始終高挺、並無回跌可能、因籌碼之乾涸、難敵殷富之搜羅、故抬價甚高、趨勢堅挺、除非大戶出籠、市價難能回跌也、外幣因外滙軟弱、烚赤上漲銳利、價甚堅俏、散戶吸納英美金鎊金票而收藏者甚殷、日金票交易亦特盛、上升鋒銳、公會交易稀少、僅承泰出長泰進英金票五十鎊、長泰出鎭興進英金票二十鎊、承泰出鎭興進英金票三十鎊、昨日市價英金鎊升四角、英金票升一角二分、美金鎊升叫角、美金票升二分五厘、香港票升一分三厘、法郞票升半厘、新加坡票升一分、荷蘭票升二分、加拿大票升五分、斐律濱票升二分、羅比票升四分、澳金票升五角、僅德金票義大利票安南票暹邏票未更、</p>
<h3>英印銀價回降</h3>
<p>十六日倫教電、投機家曾出、缺乏維持、市况尚平、收鰲後平中帶呆、售者照掛牌低〇六二五肯　、然進者均無納胃、大條銀近遠期俱回縮一二五、紐的銀電、美銀價依然有行無市、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平靜、現貨回縮三安那、近遠期亦回降一安那、</p>
<h3>貼現率漸平定</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、漸轉穩定、每千元終日盤於三十六七元之間、最後三十六元半、比前日再微高二角五分、</p>
<h3>油餅　連油價高　成交祗有五十桶　期貨囤戶有回出</h3>
<p>大連現豆油、昨市承上日暴騰餘風、再漲角半、價爲二十八元四角半、但成交僅爲五十桶、致期貨亦有行囤回出、計做開一月底交一百二十桶、價二十七元九角半、一月二十日交五十桶、價二十八元一角、二月份下半月裝輪成交一百桶、價二十七元七角半、其他烟台岐山油仍守原盤二十一元、成交一百五十件、大連岐山油五十件、價二十六元、比上日市再漲三角、</p>
<p>昨有生油三百件自烟台來、</p>
<h3>豆餅零星交易　尙不寂寞　餅豆進出俱有</h3>
<p>豆餅近來溫台泉厦等處零星交易、頗屬熱鬧、故行情頻見升騰、昨大有餘廠四牌餅已開至三元一角一分、常州協豐廠四牌元隆餅亦開三元一角一分、大有五牌餅再砌一分、爲二元八角九分、統共做開各餅三千片、</p>
<p>昨有小豆餅二千一百六十片、大豆餅四百九十片、豆子一百五十包、自車寗運來、</p>
<p>又昨日出口、則有豆子一百七十噸運孟買、三十噸運哥倫布、</p>
<p>又令日有豆餅九百片及豆子三百包運厦鬥、又豆子一千五百包運香港、</p>
<h3>絲市　海外絲市一致飛漲</h3>
<p>一說日本育蠶數量减縮　本埠絲市遂亦大見活躍</p>
<p>昨日海外絲市、一致飛漲、紐的交易所近期開一·八五五元、計漲四分半之巨、遠期一·七九元、漲一分半、紐的日絲八三分·七五分、各激漲四分、上海絲七八分亦漲三分、廣東絲漲四分、里昂日絲漲二·五〇法郞、上海絲AB級各漲一法郞至一·五〇法郞、廣東絲則漲二法郞、其原由、據云係日本今年育蠶量、或將受戰事影響而下縮之故、然此說尚未得可靠方面之證實、本埠絲市、昨受刺激甚劇、白廠七八分持價超越一三五〇元以上、且因二月期貨早已售罄、故未聞售開、法莊方面、昨至爲熱烈、白廠B字無勻度絲售開一三一〇——一三二〇元、較前日猛漲二〇兀左右、金雙豹等級之細條份、已逼近一五〇〇元關、計信孚·誠昌·開利等共爭購八十担、輯里經寂靜已久、咋因白廠經飛漲之故、亦大見活躍如麒麟跑馬金洋泉水等穴個號子、售開八一〇元、（最近曾跌至七八〇元）、計較月初漲三十元、及至下午、輯里經之討價、已升至八三〇元矣、故昨日絲市至稱在熱、昨有湖絲五百五十四件運法、又有茶葉一百噸運歐洲、</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷不滿三百包　棉紗抬價亦難</h3>
<p>紗市始張繼回、結果尙漲趨勢升降不一、大有不脫盤旋局面、藍以近日證券波濤洶湧、致一般投機商心神恍惚不定、但囤戶仍活躍、市價幷騰、同時同業某某等鑒於國內棉產區域、紊亂如蔴、物價殊難看鬆、廠方獲利澹泊、收買看漲之念、油然而生、逢低時突來及收、故市價波動、時起時仆、客銷因價格太高、實需岑寂、且廢歷年關將屆、商業習慣上嘗有一度結束、故投機者雖心思濃厚、實際消化始終不起、因此市價脚地未見十分鞏固、高峰一見即回平矣、歸根結蒂、非寶請來扶植、難以堅挺也、</p>
<p>昨開盤以公債照舊付息、人心震盪、同業及囤戶活動殊力、又謂財力富裕者賣出公債、套進棉紗、買氣濃烈、二十支雙馬開價跳四元半爲三百八十六元、同行成交二十五包、未幾汕頭帮來進三十包、再加一元半、爲三百八十七元半、市况依然硬張、旋以同業互做交易雖尚堪支持、然客方銷胃未健、除汕頭帮進二百包外、其他採辦甚鮮、雲南帮亦無發展氣象、市價由高轉低、步步而下、最後二十支雙馬紗爲三百八十三元、比高價回挫四元半、查上午成交統計六百十五包、同行成交佔一半以上、結果行情二十支雙馬紗價比上日漲一元半、天女漲一元半、特金城漲一元、雙地球漲一元半、十支粗紗亦緊昂、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城十五包、價爲三百九十元、今日有紗四十件送厦門、二十件運香港父昨日由天津運來疋頭棉紗一千零五十件、各帮買去額景誌左、</p>
<p>日紗銷路狹隘、人心平澹、二十支水月紗三百〇八元半、本月份三百〇六元半至七元、二十支藍鳳紗三百〇六元、本月份三百〇四元七角半至〇三元七角半、</p>
<h3>外棉交易沉靜　白包花尙熱鬧</h3>
<p>本棉生意較暢、但仍以白包花爲熱俏、賣價依然與上日無甚軒輊、亦無榮辱可分、益呈僵持之局面也、永安廠進姚花　五百包，其餘無大購胃、裕豐廠亦進打包花四百件、此項棉花、係採取色彩光澤之故、與印棉攙和紡紗之用、至於天津細絨棉來源固缺、然中外</p>
<p>外棉市價、美棉因華盛頓對於貸款棉出售問題、仍未解决、投機者裹足不前、銀行界暫抱觀望態度、國內紗廠因布疋暢銷、對原棉進胃仍屬健旺、連日在市上選購現貨頗烈、昨日紐的因紐奧綸絲帮拋出遠期、市價因之下跌四五磅音、遠期猛跌十三四磅音、印度連同預測跌一羅比半、埃及跌二十餘磅音　昨日滙兌因受公債影響、未能放長、折合法幣、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲二角、印棉跌一角、埃及棉跌一元餘、</p>
<p>本市外棉交易、甚爲靜寂、華廠方面除鴻章購進印棉三百包及巴西棉二百包外、新中國亦購買印棉三百包、德豐亦有巴西棉二百包交易、合送廠價爲八十七元、日廠交易仍爲主要買戶、成交額及棉價分列於後、</p>
<p>昨日成交件額各廠一律無採納胃口、華日廠購訂美印棉與日俱進、因此本棉地位完全被其侵奪殆盡矣、所以每日成交僅係白似花點綴而已、包額雖不惡，然擔脚殊鮮、惟同業每日購辦尚稱熱鬧、據云都係轉解某廠為多數、且混稱多報同業生意也、又訊姚花　續抵滬、額量日鉅、抵解廠方、蘇北一路來源不惡、計到通州粗細絨二千五百十六包、阜寗來三百九十作、茲將成交量價列左、</p>
<p>外棉折合市價列左</p>
<h3>糧食　洋麥一船今日進口　數額八千六百噸　現粉市况無變化</h3>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>昨現粉市况，迄無變化、本客銷路、殊無特色、惟零星點綴、尚不寂寞、津帮及秦皇島等處每日有一二萬包裝出、南洋福汕帮每一船位、亦有一萬包左右裝出、故每日成交、不脫二三萬包數量、昨市本街零批交易照常不减、客化較前略遜、成交綜計二萬餘包、二號粉廠盤久穩、仍爲四元九角、市面居於醞釀中、</p>
<p>今日有粉二千六百包運天津、一千包運威海衛、八千一百包運厦門、</p>
<p>小麥</p>
<p>昨小麥來源、車輪併計不下四千包、各廠進胃銳减、市面殊無特色、聞某廠前定之洋麥一船、業由怡和輪船「倍俚」號裝運來滬、大致今日進口、明後日可抵碼頭、下星期初可以卸淸、其額數爲八千六百三十二噸、本埠麥市、不無稍受影響、昨日福新阜豐兩廠每家僅辦三千包、共成交六千包之數、最高價爲六元七角、市面續見平定、</p>
<h3>粳米到多銷路稀　高客秈堅持未開</h3>
<p>粳米</p>
<p>來源轉夥、到河下上餘艘、車輪包子六七千包、早市開手因天時陰雨、人心尚佳、及後到源漸夥、銷塲轉懈、本街及囤戶包子去路頓見遜色、市面平定、厚粳悉守原盤、未見榮辱、而薄稻以去路允淡、定中帶軟、杜洋埠尖隨粳市平定、變元續見貨稀、而去路尚熱，然售盤已在十四兀外、故難再高、</p>
<p>秈客</p>
<p>雖到頭不絕、存底充足、然以本尖貨乏價昂之故、續爲本街各戶所過問、昨市去化略减、行情依然平定、特高之南京尖仍喊價十一元高蕪秈亦喊昂至十元零七八角、但進戶不似日前之貪辦、市上成交者統係大市高貨、蕪高秈十元零六角半、十元零五角半、中次自十元零三四角至九元九角左右、統市成交一千多包、</p>
<h3>煤炭　鴻基白煤　續到一千餘噸</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤、銷路激增、但此間塊煤存積甚稀、以致供不數求、市色續秀、咋日本埠義泰與有定貨一千餘噸到埠、人心漸見安定、市價趨穩、同行拆價、計開統塊每噸四十五元、飾塊四十七元、拷塊四十九元、棧房出貨、送到另加車力、</p>
<h3>疋頭　色布白貨趨勢互歧　細斜走銷呆滯售盤紊亂　色布市面堅挺出數不敷</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>白貨花色貨趨勢互歧、乃以需胃不同、銷量懸殊之故、細布·細斜走勢呆滯、僅本街購染坯下檔細斜五十包、川帮購富貴細布二十五包、浙贛汕港帮均祗散額成交、市盤紊亂、散戶手貨賣出、每疋按市廉一角左右、粗布銷路亦佳、價仍堅定、細紗織物以原料昂貴、價均趨漲、光中廠直貢開價每碼三角九分二厘半、嗶嘰三角八分七厘半、較上週每碼漲五厘、藍布·色斜·漂布生意最爲生色、蜀帮添聯三千餘疋、滇帮亦添近二千疋、蘇北阜寗帮辦藍布·色斜·嗶嘰·貢呢一千三百疋、汕頭需胃最濃、昨續添購一百餘箱、天津及溫·甬帮，泉州帮亦源源購辦、故色布市面堅挺、出品不敷、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>市面堅穩、晨市略形回軟、旋得津帮購進大量交易之援助、本街染布業以色布銷路不惡、亦即追踪購進、價復回挺、結果細布中上檔較前日漲起二分半至五分、下檔細布及各牌細斜價均平平、天津帮進各牌細布·細斜近千件、本街染坯及客帮零躉批發成交五百件之譜、內外四君子直貢·嗶嘰每碼漲一厘二毫半、本街批發號進胃仍健、成交五十餘箱、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日疋頭出口、計有三十件運厦門、十件運香港、三十件運海防、七十件運威海衛、二百四十件運天津、</p>

<h3>湖北戰時敎育的試騐　（一）</h3>
<p>— 陳劍翛</p>
<p>戰時敎育和正常敎育是不是相同、道是敎育學者所爭辯得最烈的一個問題、自主張戰時敎育和正常敎育相同者看來、兩者是性實上的相同、他們認爲敎育的作用、無非是給予靑年學生以充分的健全的知識和技能、使他們成功一個良好的個人和公民、能够替社會服務、也能够替國家民族爭生存、就一般理論而言、敎育也是一種延續國家民族生命的工具、其功能在儲蓄和增强國家民族之精神和物質力量、這是敎育上最大目的、無論誰都會表贊同的、平時的敎育是如此、戰時的敎育也應該如此、關係基本的準備的工作、猶之乎科學的訓練、祗求努力於有系統的知識之建設、然後應用到各方面去探求眞理、自然可以　應無窮的、不過這是代表一派的議論、另外有人主張戰時敎育和正常敎育、應該有些不同、近幾年來、我國因受日本帝國主義的使略、非常時期敎育、國難敎育、以及國防敎育的耍求、曾一再提出抗戰以來戰時敎育或抗戰時期敎育的呼聲、更屬甚囂塵上、敎育部並有戰時敎育研究會的設立、敎育界人士也在漢口發起組織全國戰時敎育協會、可見戰時敎育和正常敎育、確有若干不同的地方、其動因無非是想利用敎育的方法和力量、去適應戰爭的進行時期、或如我國之抗戰時期各種迫切需要、而施行各種臨時訓練、爰經擬定湖北中等以上學校聯合設立辦法、經過省政府委員會議通過、並由省政府咨請敎育部備案、而且在暑假中、承蒙陳部長當面表示贊許、認爲原則極好、辦法應該特別留意擬訂、因此就着手進行了、現在把這個聯中辦理情形、槪括的報吿一下、（一）聯中分校的分佈溯自第三期抗戰以來、武漢雙成後方的重鎭、一切軍事活動、都以此地爲中心、戒機旁午、正常敎育的進行、幾乎成了不可能的趨勢、况武漢三鎭、教育文化機關、多被敵機摧殘、損失非常之鉅、我們爲策畫員生長久安全、與敎學利便計、就在八月初計劃設立一個大規模的聯合中等以上學校、幷將高中·初中·女高初中·師範。女師鄉師職業。女職農專·高農·高工·高商初農·初工等分校、設立於鄂西那北偏遠縣份、共計二十二分校、可惜多數的分校、仍集中巴東恩施建始數縣、但是確實不得已了、（二）分校校舍的籌劃　聯合中等以上學校、於八月初旬决定設立之倏、即經敎育廳於八九兩月內、先後派出職員舒文博李鑑淸等九人、分途前往鄂西鄂北縣份去查勘各分校校舍、後來因給養交通治安及時局種種困難、除少數地址巳有變更外、其餘均在原定地城找到校舍、大半是廟宇祠堂、或世家巨厦、由敎育廳發給修繕費、趕修佈置、幸於十一月杪至十二月一日陸續開學、每校修繕費少至一千元、多至叫千四百元不等、也有少數例外超過這數額的、（三）敎導事務的設施聯中一切敎學設施、均含有試騐性質、但它的課程內容、完全參照國立中學辦法、以精紳訓練、使個個中等學校學生、都懂得一點軍事學科術科、個個專科以上學校學生、對於取事各部門、有相當的了解、同時傘高中之圖畫國文音樂等課目、酌量减少、就騰出的時間、加重軍事訓練、有些省份竟將軍訓時間、比較平時增加到七倍、諸如此類、不勝校舉、總之、時勢演變到現階段、大家不得不相信爲了抗戰必勝、建國必成、一切學校臊程、要戰爭化、一切救亡工作、要教育化、即已檢查湖北已往規定的非常時期訓練大綱、也曾訂定軍訓敎材、高中軍訓敎材、第一學年以士兵訓練爲主、每週八小時、全體學生都要參加、第二與第三年、以下級幹部訓練爲主、每週時間也是八小時、至於體弱或因其他緣故、不適於上述訓練的學生、那就呌他自由參加　防空、　警衛、　救護、　民訓、　工程等五組裏面的一組、以成就所謂後方勤務訓練、每週也屬八小時、故自設施上言、敎育實在已經趨於戰時化、以適合戰時的需求了、我於本年六月杪、到湖北後、即從事於中等以上學校的改革、也是環境和時代的情勢使然、所有關於中等學校的更張、不敢自誇爲我們的創獲之見、只是大時代新環境的產物、這决湖北中等以上學校改革的最大一點、就是把湖北全省所有的公私中等以上學校聯合設立、（平常簡稱爲湖北聯中）以統一敎育界意志、看重實用敎育、增强敎育效能、並圖發展本省偏遠縣份文化、救濟貧苦失學靑年、培養國家民族元氣、以樹立抗戰建國的基礎、自經省政府主席陳辭修先生提出這個大主張、以體育訓練、學科訓練、生產勞動訓練、及戰時後方服務訓練等項爲主、允以不降低原有正常敎育程度爲原則、而且持別注意訓育、各分校除設訓育組組長一人外、並看分校班數多寡、設立訓育助理員、六班的一人、二十叫班的六人、又遵照部令厲行導師制、在各年級設立級導師一人至三人、而訓育組長、彷彿是一個主任導師、（未完）</p>

<h3>到渦陽第四區</h3>
<p>——徐州突圍憶記</p>
<p>經了半天的激戰，昨夜九點鐘才趕到徐蘆，想在夜間我們通過徐蘆時，給我們一陣襲擊的敵人，遺棄了三四百具死屍，和不少的槍彈，狼狽逃跑了。</p>
<p>分拿着奪獲戰利品，隊伍浩浩蕩蕩地的便繼續前進。</p>
<p>天晴朗得一片雲也沒有，太陽怪火辣辣的，路上的沙土被炙熱得像一口燒紅了的鐵鍋，田野裹的麥苗在太陽的溫柔的撫摸下，靜靜的在躺着。</p>
<p>一點風也沒有，頂着一枝樹枝，拖着泡破了又起了泡，第二次的泡破了又起泡的兩隻疼痛不堪的脚，一顚一拐地走在那燙得要命的土路上。口渴得要命，汗不住的只是流。</p>
<p>一隻敵機忽然出現在天空裹，前進着的人馬，立刻便掩藏在樹下和麥田裏去。</p>
<p>敵機在頭頂上盤旋了一轉，無結果的便飛開了，於是，人馬又滙合成一條鐵流，前進着。</p>
<p>只要一遇到水，即使是那末汚穢的，人便像一窠蜂似的圍攏了起來，爭着吃着。</p>
<p>已經到了下午五點多鐘，到了渦陽縣的第四區。這是一個還相當寬大的古城，但早已成空，一個老百姓也沒有了。據說，在一個星期以前，敵人曾佔領過此地，城外還遺留着敵人安置的電話綫……</p>
<p>在城內我不到甚麼吃的。帶着幾天來沒有得好好的陸過一夜，和吃過一頓飯的難耐的飢餓和疲乏，便到城外的一座長十餘丈，寬二丈餘的石橋，坐着等着隊伍出發。</p>
<p>這時，太陽剛落入地平綫下去，西方的天空是一抹燦爛的紅霞，晚風帶着使人輕快的淸凉，徐徐的在吹着。橋下是渦河的半河淸水，有三四只主人不知已逃到那裏去的鴨子，自由地在河裏優游着。</p>
<p>望着這當有詩意的景物，天天在戰鬥的生活中過日子的一顆緊張的心，忽然竟變得悠閒起來，我幾乎忘記了是在突圍了。</p>
<p>突然，一羣人馬從橋上走了過來，這裏面有東北軍，川軍，廣西軍，……望着他們艱難的，像一些小脚婦人，扭着腰肢走路的模樣，我差點忍不住笑起來。</p>
<p>其實，我們走路的模樣，同他們也幷沒有兩樣，但我們忘記了自己的痛苦了。</p>
<p>過了半夜，在明亮的月光下，隊伍就沿着公路，嚴肅地向渦陽出發。</p>
<h3>早晨</h3>
<p>— 柳攸</p>
<p>方長成了的碩大的樹，雖沒有果子，却被一簇簇的綠葉裝飾得十分年輕。初長羽毛的小爲，已會很可愛的歌唱，表顯牠是靈巧的小動物。這顆樹，這隻小鳥，牠們是成熟了的芽，牠們象徵着早晨。</p>
<p>每個早晨，我總是期望着，期望着這一天，可貴的一天，在我奮發的征送上，不至徒然。</p>
<p>早晨，我總是有一篇獻辭，祝頌着我一生中的一天；這時候，我最淸爽，最愉快，也可說我最偉大，最眞誠！</p>
<p>在早晨，我已洗去我昨日的罪惡，在我無邪的心底，正欲把握着我的毅力，衝出荊棘叢，跳出崎嶇的小路，等待着新的降臨。</p>
<p>從曙光微明後，直到高昇起太陽，那遍射的陽光，都給我們指示着光明的前途。雄雞的高喊，是警鐘，或是在勸導。早晨絲毫不會使我們悲哀或絕望。</p>
<p>每天都有個早晨，每一個早晨是一樣可貴的，牠被每一個人深深地愛　着。</p>
<p>每一個早晨，是我們得到美好的果實的象徵！</p>
<h3>陳鄉長</h3>
<p>— 珊</p>
<p>薄暮而且陰雨。破舊的廳堂裏，窗口桌上，日間的光明將撤退它最後的一綫。圍着三四個鄉人，抖抖地由鄉長手裏接過證明書，夾夾紅眼，悄悄地溜出去了。天上滸滸地飛着的是鎗彈，落在瓦上像一隻隻麻雀。陳鄉長拋下筆，望望天，吁了一口長氣，似乎完成了一件偉業，自己沉醉着。雨從半開的窗口飛進來，滴在陳鄉長好久不剃的鬍鬚根上，覺得門去了。這時村前村後已經通走光了，留着幾條狗在路旁向鄉長搖尾。天更黑下來，雨也沒有歇的意思。近身靜得像死的一樣，遠處則有不絕的槍聲，連成一片，像落霰般的頗是和諧。狗擺足勢子，向一邊撲過，順着看去，是一個我們的兵，東張西望的往這邊來。狗們站得老遠的監視着，一邊退，一邊吠。陳鄉長問問那個兵，知道他是迷了路，要到太平凉冷而淸醒。他突然感到地位的危急，回進裏面，看見老母拈着佛珠念佛，旁邊站着妻兒，各拿了衣包，準備避難。外面匆遽地有人進來，是至友薛先生的聲首：</p>
<p>「兵已經很近，還不走嗎？別走不成！」</p>
<p>「我們就走，但恐怕還有捨不得走的鄉人，我得去吿訴他們暫時避避。」</p>
<p>陳鄉長請薛先生坐着等一會，自己穿起套鞋，匆匆地出橋去，陳鄉長自己答應做嚮導，翻身又跑回家來。</p>
<p>「莘畊，莘畊，點起火，隨我來，送一個戰士上前綫！」</p>
<p>他的兒子一聲不響點起燈，竄了出去。薛先生噎着要去，陳鄉長不許，託他在家陪伴老母。</p>
<p>於是，三個人，一頂傘，一盞燈，一晃一晃地沒入了黑暗之中，漸漸只見那燈搖搖的像一隻螢蟲，一會也不見了。</p>
<p>薜先生陪着陳老太太等到半夜不見鄉長回家，大家都急了，槍聲愈來愈近，槍子竟從屋上穿墮下來，逼得大家只能伏倒地上。</p>
<p>天明了，更不能動，敵兵已經掩上村來，滿村都是鎗彈，大家躱得不敢出頭。繳倖得很，沒有給敵兵搜到，只是陳鄉長還沒有回來。</p>
<p>再過了一天，火綫已經移了過去，薜先生冒險出門，順着路向太平橋走去。在楊家橋，茶店老頭罅開了扇門，向薛先生招手。薛先生閃了進去，那老頭掩上門，睜大了眼，低聲說：</p>
<p>「鄉長回家沒有？那天晚上，他陪着一個兵，打這裏走過，那燈沒了油，在這裏加上些。那時的鎗呀，眞怕人，我說讓我領了去罷，他還不肯呌我辛苦，說外面怪滑的，省得老頭穿靴打傘的了。從此以後，不會聽見他回過來，我老是記掛着，記掛着……」</p>
<p>薛先生急起來，不顧老頭的　叨，再溜向街上來。街上許多死屍，好一會，纔遇到了一個活人，是王四。王四說看見鄉長坐在路旁。</p>
<p>「這時候，坐在路旁？」</p>
<p>「是，坐在路旁，我老遠望過去，是陳鄉長。」</p>
<p>兩個人從死屍堆裏繞過去，來到一處，路旁坐着陳鄉長，低眉閉目，像睡熟了似的，地上躺着莘畊，却赤着膊，血肉模糊。</p>
<p>「鄉長，鄉長，你歸天去了？」王四哭着，薛先生也跪下了。</p>
<p>「鄉長，鄉長，我們要永遠記着你！」</p>
<h3>活捉</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>傍晚，兩個帶着膏藥徽章的趕到道條巷裹來探看，一見着那站在門口的人，不的而同，他們當即歡躍起來，心裏說，『我們知道，這里一定有個年靑的女人；哈哈！前幾回都給你逃過了，這回可逃不過了！』</p>
<p>獰笑着，一搖一擺的，他們加緊脚步，一直向那目標過去。</p>
<p>他們一走近，那女人就轉身進門，隨手把門關攏，蓬的一響。</p>
<p>『什麼！不讓我們進去麼！』</p>
<p>稍帶怒色的，一個這樣說，一個用脚把門踢開，見着了還在堂前跑着的女人，他們又獰笑起來。</p>
<p>門兜裏有兩個男子在春米，廊下有兩個男子在編織竹器，可是他們色膽如天，旁若無人，眼中只有那女人，就進了鬥一直尚裹面追去。</p>
<p>前面的女人，經過堂前以后當即轉灣，跨進內房，把房門關攏。房門沒有像台門的結實，更容易踢開。猶如老鷹抓小鷄，兩個武人捉一個弱女，本是便利的事情，他們把她撳在牀上了。</p>
<p>『好！現在還想逃到那里去！說是已經死了，你，難道是個鬼麼？』</p>
<p>『倒是漂亮的，不錯！就是鬼，漂亮的鬼，也得幹！』</p>
<p>還在四天以前，這兩個帶着膏藥徽章的，曾用着調查戶口的名義，到這里來搜索過人。那時，這家的主婦得了村口瞭望人的通知，是伏在田裹的，不管鞋襪衣服弄髒，連頭帶腦都蓋上稻草。不過雖然不曾被發見，因爲忙於躱藏，却把一雙時式的方口皮鞋遺留在房中，忘記了收拾。他們見着，就認定這家有着靑年的女人。家中人再三的說這鞋子是死人的遺物，他們總不相信。他們多方探查，用餅乾誘騙小孩子：『你的媽在那里？』又用話恐嚇。因此他們每天都到這里來。</p>
<p>撳在牀上的女人當然掙扎不晚：但她並不呼喊，也不驚慌，反而曙暗的冷笑。</p>
<p>『好！』</p>
<p>這樣說了，一手一個，她把撳着她的兩個人的嘴巴都捫住，隨即牀後面的帳子突自掀起，伸出來了四隻粗壯的手，同時又有兩個强壯的男子從橱背後躍出，很快的把那兩個帶着膏藥徽章的捆住，並且緊緊的紮好嘴巴，使不能聲張。兩個勇士捆綁一條淫混，遊刃有餘；即使抓握他們不住，台門早就緊閉，房外還有着假作春米和編織竹器的勇士準備着。</p>
<p>原來，因爲見着了鞋子天天要來找女人的事情，給在失地中行動的志士知道了，認作好機會，當即去聯絡遊擊戰鬥員，商定了這憫辦法。原有的主婦已害怕得病倒了，避在山上，作爲引誘物的主婦，也是由勇敢的女志士打扮起來的。</p>
<p>爲着恐嚇老百姓，這兩個俘虜，都是全身武裝的。取下槍械和彈藥來，都可以作爲助長遊擊之用。可是他們的嘴巴，更其值得利用。無慮言語隔膜，遊擊隊中多着深通外國話的人物；因此，先使捆綁着的明瞭，他們原也有着親愛的妻子的，被人驅策，這才流爲在妄，陷於絕境。他們受了感動，就解去他們的束縛，他們自動地報吿出了鎮上的軍事情形。藉着道個綫索，不久就造成了對方軍車出軌，截斷鐵路的戰績。</p>
<h3>我的歌唱</h3>

<h3>悖入悖出</h3>
<p>— 力士</p>
<p>有因必有果，有果也必有因；同樣的因，必生同樣的果。這是一切自然現象的定律。</p>
<p>諺云。「種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆」，種瓜種豆，因也，得瓜得豆，果也，所以「悖而入者，亦悖而出」，有悖入的因，是逃避不了悖出的果的。</p>
<p>種瓜得瓜，種互得豆，是耕耘的收穫，勞力的報酬，是屬於正常的。而一般事業，也唯有正常的由艱辛歷程中締造成功的，方能克保永久。至於悖而入者，則是意外的遭遇，一時的倖致，是風於反常的。因爲意外和倖致，却促成當事者僥倖性，而致認識糢糊，倒因爲果，所以會悖而出；有的甚至身敗名裂，家產蕩然，弄得不可收拾。</p>
<p>悖入悖出的故事，在賭博塲中最多發現。賭博行爲，本來是僥倖性所促成的，何况賭客賭得混淘淘的時候，理智早就消滅，更不懂得這種悖入悖出的因果。因此，最初贏得的錢，結果還是輸脫。有的輸了不算，繼續再賭，再賭則再輸，愈輸則愈賭。所謂贏了想多贏，輸了想翻本，誰知越翻却越深，這是賭博者的心理和潰敗的原因。</p>
<p>我們的東隣「友邦」，它的崛起，可以說大半是意外的，僥倖的。它一經中日之戰，再經日俄之戰，三經世界大戰，於是便一步步地强盛起來。識知他們忽略了客觀的因素，却以戰爭爲强盛的法寶，以致歷年來窮兵黷武，軍閥當權，意想完成「大陸帝國」的迷夢，而在蘆溝橋曉起侵咯之火，豈料現在事實所表現的，他們過去由戰爭中得來的强盛，現在已由戰爭中失去了。</p>
<p>是的，他們過去是悖而入者，當然難免現在的悖而出。他們過去贏了想多贏，現在輸了想翻本，當然將陷入越翻却越深的悲慘的境地。</p>
<h3>看了劉海粟近作歸來</h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>看畫原不是易事，因爲看畫要懂得畫，不懂畫而也假作風雅去看畫，眞所謂「盲子看畫壁，」可是我確是其中人物</p>
<p>我在學堂念書時候，一星期也有兩個鐘頭圖畫，這位先生倒也是杭州小小有名的畫家。爲了淸季剛辦學堂，現在學校出身的畫家，尚在養成之中，所以那時候所畫的大都是毛筆變相的鉛筆畫，後來即轉入當時所謂的幾何畫，但是我在圖畫課時候，只見先生簌簌地在黑板上畫，而我呢，往往老鼠畫成了兔子，山羊畫成了出胡鬚的白犬，如其沒有先生替我加上幾筆，我總是不能繳卷的！</p>
<p>近年來見書畫會，往往去觀光一番，這也無非消磨時間；再則我們住的沒有庭圃遊的，旣沒有功夫，亦沒有錢財；足可爲我坐臥欣賞的，除了斗室之中，幾張破舊書畫外，—新的價貴買不起，另外找不到賞心樂目之事。那末，有書審會可以瀏覽，無論懂與不懂，樂得去跑一趟。劉海粟近作去觀覽，也是這用意。</p>
<p>「藝術叛徒」這四字，早已震驚了；何况他的作品，有口皆碑，原不容多說。我只將所陳列狀况寫出來。</p>
<p>這一次所謂近作展覽，倒是以國畫爲宗，據他陳列目錄所載，共有一百四十九件，油畫只有二十件，國畫倒有一百二十九件，油畫只占百分之十四而弱，可見海粟的近作，漸趨重在團畫方面了，亦或許是爲給本國人參觀，所以特地將油畫陳列减少到最少地位。</p>
<p>海果的國畫，似乎學的在八大山人近人如吳昌碩王一亭之間，所謂粗筆仗是也。粗筆仗不但要講神韻，還要講氣魄，近人之學吳王者，多見其爲「黑漆一團糟」，這是大誤了。雖說是粗筆仗，不尚工細，但是準繩仍舊是不能少的；越是疎疎幾筆，越是非同凡作，這也是功到自成，原不可强而致之。</p>
<p>神韻，我說是國畫的特徵，但可以神會，不可以言說。有時一幅畫，大有减一筆不可，增一筆不能，所謂恰到好處，這纔是神品了。至於畫的布局，那是一畫的結搆所關。有如所陳列諸畫中，有一幅爲王一亭添補了一輪明月，就要觀察到這一幅畫的布局，究竟需要不需要這一輪明月，這在作家自會明白，而如我是門外漢，簡直不明白其中神理了。</p>
<p>劉海粟摹的米派潑墨山水，他自題有云：（原文記不淸）米派山水，在有意無意間；他自己所摹的亦在似米非米之間，的是至言。無論其爲寫字，爲作畫，不能不有所取則。可是臨摹，無論如何神妙逼肖，其結果終究是臨摹！故畫匠之所以爲畫匠，畫師之所以爲畫師，山水人物，禽鳥花卉，未嘗不皆然，所差者只此一點神韻而已。可見臨摹之中，也要自已打點主宰。</p>
<p>所謂近作展覽，以其多爲近時作品，但有一幅題詞，似乎寫的爲二十八年冬，如其不是我記憶錯誤，那易使觀者一時有所迷惑，因爲一般人心理，多以目前之冬，歸之於二十七年，好在這是無足重輕，或許我是記錯了。</p>
<p>諸畫之中，亦有林森，于右任·蔡元培·葉恭綽諸人題詞，更見聲價倍增。但以爲畫之品題，最好仍請畫家去品題。假如我若能畫，定去請馮超然·湯定之·趙叔孺·商笙伯去品題一番，纔有意義。</p>
<p>說來說去，沒有說到劉海粟近作是怎樣，多是空話，說他則甚。是不是要得春秋一些稿費，貼補參觀門票所費麼？或許也有這點用意在內，一笑</p>
<h3>雨過天晴</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二回　林工師妙解標準化　金導員高談平等觀</p>
<p>金澹雲小姐鼻子裹哼了一聲道。「你這活有些矛盾」。林建成道：「怎麼說我的話是矛盾呢？金小姐道：「我問你！那梵王渡這個八層樓的工人第一力厦，是你設計建造的嗎」？林建成笑着點頭。金小姐道：「這倒我陪了外賓去參觀過。要說標準化，沒有像那座房子的標準化了，你却還說不贊成標準化。旣不贊成標準化，爲什麼自己就設計建造那樣的房子呢」？金小姐父向何家兩位小姐道：「那座大厦，是專造給工人們住的，裏面是無數的小房間。這一個大厦內，大的可住四五百家人家，全是工人的家庭。但房子是差不多樣子的，房間也是一樣的，裏面的傢具，什麼牀啊，桌子，椅子啊，也都是一樣的。醫如三百另一號的房間，和三百另二號妒房間，全無兩樣，稍爲粗心的人，走到自己家裹，竟要走到別人屋子裹去。我問問那管理工人大住宅的人，他說：「這是呌做標準化，造房子的時候，我們的工程師，就標準化起來了」。問他：「工程師是誰」？喏！就是道位林建成先生！他此刻反說不贊成標準化，所以我得問問他」。林建成笑道：「好了！小姐！這應得要受你的攻駁。但造這座房子，也有好幾個原因，並非是言與行違。一則：是受命而來，造房子之先，就預備是做工人們的住宅的，所以但求堅實，樸素，合於衛生，就足够了。旣然房間這麼樣多，要每一間都不同，是做不到的。二則：這座房子造的很快，因爲戰後的中國，工業大興，工人的住屋，發起恐慌來了，所以不能不在八個月內造成。爲了求其造成的快，許多東西，不能不標準化了。譬如屋內的鋼窗，水管，衛生設備等，都是現成的，照着一定的標準，製造好的，只要在房子裏裝上就成了，那不是省時省力了嗎？三則：那座大厦裏，除了有幾間屋子，爲公共設備之用外。其餘的租價，都是一例的。旣然租價是一致的，房子自不免趨於一致了。可是如你剛纔所說的，有一班粗心的人，走錯別人家房間，而鬧出笑話來的事，却是常常有的了」。</p>
<h3>南京路之遞變</h3>
<p>— 洪濤</p>
<p>南京路本來是租界的中心，可是現在是整個上海的中心了，孤島的上海現象可從南京路上推現她的全貌。南京路在這短短一年餘的時間中，有不少的遞變。八一三戰事初起時，南京路的凄凉，和今日底終日熙熙攘攘，眞是意想不到的兩個極端的情形。這遞變，是南京路的興衰史上最特殊的一頁。</p>
<p>南京路在戰前，固然也是最繁盛的所在，但這繁盛，僅僅是它所處地位上所有的一點浮貌，它的內在實也掩飾不了彌漫着的不景氣，商店的無綫電以及大减價的旗幟和吹號打鼓，只是點綴着生氣，上午中午黃昏三個上班散值的時間顯得有些喧聒，其餘的時間，雖然路上行人不絕，但商店的營業並不是一槪都很興旺的，泰豐，寗波實葉銀行，大盛福，大滬銀行那幾幢模樣不錯的巨厦都空關着，但現在的情形，絕端不同了，人是自晨至暮的擠攘不絕，並不長的一條馬路上，新的商店不知增設了多少家，上面說的幾處巨厦，現在都已另有新主，煥然改觀。泰豐原址，現在是裘天寶銀樓（南京路上現在有二爿裘天寶了，原在老九綸對過的一爿是支店，總店前在小東門。）寗波實業銀行原址，現爲大昌綢緞荘，大盛福原址今爲中華國貨公司，虹　對過的一幢房子，戰前爲上海國貨公司，鄔志豪的各項事業倒掉，這幢房子也就空關起來，戰後關作難民收容所，房屋更毀圮不堪，可是現在又變成了一幢水泥門面的新厦了，它的新主就是重回南京路的方九霞銀樓。大滬銀行的大滬大樓現在改爲新大祥大樓，信大祥那輝煌的門面，也爲南京路增添了無限熱鬧。</p>
<p>南京路上現在新開的店舖，以綢緞店，銀樓，藥店，參燕號爲最多，其中藥店乃北地風光的店舖，餘者，十九是小東門轉移過來的。</p>
<p>現在南京路上中大公司中兩大公司，其門店都已改造過，先改造者爲新新，時在前歲之末，那香港式的走廊改換了，就原地位改建橱窗，舖面的門牆改爲乳黃大理石，但也許那建築不大考究，僅僅不久時間，那色澤望上去已有點黯然無光了。後改者爲先施，也把底層面牆改爲淡黃大理石，到現在似乎還未全部竣工，而先施全部玻璃遮廊，也都改爲水泥的，這諒因以前的鐵架，受炸彈炸彎的影響，不能全部改直，所以只能水泥來包掩了。</p>
<p>先施的炸彈傷痕，似乎已完全沒有影踪了，但筆者却發見一個永不能滅的破綻，就是先施二樓凉台上換去的二根盤龍錢柱，其盤龍　勢與原有的適相反，原有的是向上盤的，現換的是向下盤的，這也許是工人的一時疏忽，但這眞可爲這創傷留下一個痕跡。日後如有人修南京路的掌故，這是南京路的大事記之一，我道段話可供參證，所以不憚辭費的在此多寫一筆。</p>
<h3>街頭的藝術家</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>人羣擁擠得像流潮似的都市街頭，從淸晨到黃昏，到深夜，總沒有過片刻的間斷或停息，有閒者的逛蕩，求生活者的奔走，追等財利者的忙碌，以及失業者的徘徊，來來往往的，以致形成了街頭的特殊熱鬧；而各個有藝術製作技能的失業者，也因而能在這種盛况裏以藝技的做作來向羣衆博換營養生命的物質。這種生活圈中掙扎者的勤奮進取，的確加高了「家有千貫，不如一技在身」的古訓底評價。因此，來作幾個街頭藝術家們的簡單報道：——</p>
<p>剪影　剪影者在上海，似乎近年來才在街頭出現，他們在市街邊沿掛着一塊硬紙板，貼着各種剪成的人像，持着一把剪刀，幾張黑紙，不用高聲的喊呌，也不用廣吿宣傳，祇是靜默地站立在一個角落裏，等待欣賞者來惠顧：他們每剪一張人像，只取五分或一角，而且立刻可取。一般閒蕩者或者不曾見過而有奇罕感的人，必然會不吝惜這幾分代價，委他們從剪刀上取下一個自己容貌的輪廓，因此，他們一天的收獲，也足够裝飽自己的肚皮了。</p>
<p>扭字　用細銅絲扭出各種的字體，這也是頗感趣味的玩意。他們用一根紫銅絲，在一把鐵鉗的轉動彎擺中，能够很迅速的扭出中文或西文的空心字，或者幾個字接連的一句成語。這種扭字的人在製作上都有純熟的技能，因爲旣沒有取巧的機會，像與不像都有客觀的批評，不如剪影的製作，若不像尚可設詞遮掩，所以，技術不純熟的人是難以製作的。經營這種扭字的人大都在馬路角落裏席地而坐，擺一個簡單的地攤，扭一隻三字連接的人名取價二角，共他如雙喜字，壽字，福字，以及「長命百歲」，「開張鴻發」等吉利成語就加倍取值。　（未完）</p>

<h3>旅途中的藝人羣</h3>
<p>— 辛士</p>
<p>近有流浪影人自川，滇　滬，談及各　人旅途近况頗詳。茲為撮録，略述如次：</p>
<p>高占非在抗戰軍興以前，他早應邀武漢行營電影股，和黎莉莉同去漢口，前往主演「鐵血精忠」影片·起先，他們倆原都是約演一片的短期性質，及後戰事發生，便在那裏繼續服務，不復更作歸計了。當在武漢淪陷，退往重慶之後，他曾一度放棄銀燈工作，改就航空署聞官職務。旋爲中央電影塲一再堅邀，始又回復了他的舊時生舌。</p>
<p>曹禺</p>
<p>劇作家曹禺，與陳白塵，現在重慶國國立戲劇學校，主持敎務。全校學生計有八十餘人，地址在城外上慶寺那裏。他們近於課務之外，並常領導學生們在當地戲院表演他的名作「雷雨」「日出　和新排各劇。「中電」的影人們亦常加入合作。</p>
<p>孫瑜</p>
<p>他在「中電」擔任導演工作。從撤退到重慶以後，因為各項設備一時未及辦齊，工作不無阻碍。他的新作品，只曾拍過一部歷史片一岳飛」：但在抗戰宣傳上，確是有其簽多偉力的。</p>
<p>趙慧深</p>
<p>業餘劇團出發赴川，先在重慶表演甚久。　後轉往成都，迄仍續演未定。內部要員趙丹，顧而已施超等人，爲與導演人陳鯉庭等中途發生意見，不久即生那裏宣吿脫離，返回重慶，轉入「中電」。「業餘」亦於彼時由影人劇團一部份演員加入合作，改歸歸陳鯉庭與趙慧深負責主持。趙於該團向任編劇兼演員職務。她與陳鯉庭早經結愛，去年五六月間且已有了結晶品在成都製成間世。</p>
<p>謝雲卿</p>
<p>在萬里征程中經久流亡着，到了四川之後，他的生活又有了一番轉變。影人劇團的同伴們爲此對他不很滿意。謝雲卿亦即另謀出路，加入了一個歌舞班，輾轉雲貴各地儘在度着流浪生活。前一時期，有人在昆明和也遇見，看模樣是客途飄零，殊形潦　。</p>
<p>王瑩</p>
<p>救亡演劇隊第二分隊，王瑩是和洪深金山等同在一起的。彼時歷經南京，徐州等各地演　，到了漢口之後；洪深即就政治部第三廳戲劇科職務，她和金山亦曾一度加入中國製片廠拍戲。嗣後武漢淪陷，國軍西撤，她們倆的消息亦即經久隔絕了。最近，聽說早已到了桂林，依然很英勇的打起了救亡演劇隊的旗號，帶領一行伙夥伴，在那裏努力救亡宣傳。</p>
<p>其餘白楊，陳波兒，沈西苓，魏鶴齡等大批影人，大都集中重慶一處，分隸國營的兩大電影廠下，大槪的生活情形都還相當不錯。</p>
<h3>觀「黎明」獨幕劇後</h3>
<p>— 晏</p>
<p>第二中華職補校演出</p>
<p>前天的晚上，我懷着興奮的情緒，踏進寗波同鄉會，參加中華第二職業補習學校主辦的師生聯歡會。聯歡會的節目，除了一般的秩序之外，繼着便是游藝的餘興了。在八九項游藝的表演中，我認爲最能够引起觀衆的刺激，和提高觀衆的抗戰意識的，該會話劇團所主演的話劇「黎明」，是切實的合符這二個原則的，。一黎明」是一　獨幕劇，牠的情節，是相當的緊張的。形容一對出賣汗血精力的勞動者，—福生和蓮香，被八一三」的烽火，打燬了他倆的職業。</p>
<p>福生，是工廠裏的一僩小工，失業後，他伸出了　子巴望工廠能够復業，一年後工廠總算是重新開起來了。可是，資本家的算盤，却越打越精了，他儘量用了最低微的代價，去收買大批日暮窮途，流浪街頭的難民，儘量把曾經耗盡了脂血的老友，擯棄在門外。「留職停薪」，一依次錄用」，當然是資本家對待老工友惟一好聽的時髦口號。</p>
<p>同樣的不幸，他的妻子，——蓮香，雖然在一家香烟廠裏，找到了女工的生活，可是，不滿幾個月，却又添了一個不幸的孩子。伊爲了生活，不　不把孩子　在家裏，請鄰人詞英娘給伊代管，苦命的孩子一得不到母親的撫愛，溫飽無　，終於不幸的病了。唉，天啊！這一條生活的鞭子，撻得伊一家體無完膚，福生是消極的走上消極自戕的路，伊受不性良心的斥實，激於母愛，不　坐視伊可憐的孩子，這樣痛苦的生下，悲慘的死去，好容易的廠方借到三塊錢的工資，文給伊文夫，簪孩子醫病買藥</p>
<p>可是，消極了的福生，自　了的福生，終日喝賭消憂，他胡里胡塗的，竟把孩子醫病吃藥的錢，喝完了，輸光了，他一時氣憤了，棄性多喝一些酒，拿了一把刀子，守在他以前工作的資本家的出入要道邊，乘其不意的，把榨取勞工血汗的資本家殺死了。他痛快着！懊喪着！驚嚇着！躱在外面流蕩着！雖然，他心裏實在放不下他的孩子……！話劇在這樣緊凑的情節下閉幕了。「福生跟蓮香，爲什褻失業？孩子的病，究竟怎樣？蓮香知道了丈夫的行爲，痛苦到什麼地步？……這。恐怕是每個觀衆都在思索的問題吧？</p>
<h3>中國口琴界已團結一致</h3>
<p>— 東耳</p>
<p>昨日中午主腦人晋隆會議　下月四日假葛利酒樓聯歡</p>
<p>中國口琴界的組織，一向很散漫，但最近是團結了。據可靠方面所得到的團結消息，是昨日中午十二時半，口琴界的主腦人王慶隆，（中華）石人望，（大衆）李厚襄，（光明）郁郁星，（華聯）陳劍晨，（上海）鮑明珊，）中國）六位，在晋隆飯店三樓會商一切團結事宜，聞此次會議，先次定於二月四日（星期六）晚七時半假座葛利酒樓舉行「全滬各口琴隊聯歡會，除由以上各隊隊員二百餘人參加外，並歡迎其他學校團體口琴隊員自動參加。（費用每人一元半）凡欲加入者，自即日起至本月廿八日止，每日下午二時至五時向福煦路一二三四號鮑明珊處報名。屆時除聚餐外，並有各種餘興及摸彩贈獎等舉行，以增興趣。又聞第二次會議，將定本星期六由中華口琴會王慶隆的時召集，以便報吿進行及續商種種事宜。</p>
<h3>「垂簾六十年」的特色</h3>
<p>— 司馬驊</p>
<p>國泰獻映的鉅製一垂廉六十年一，不僅彩色的攝製得到空前的美麗，演員的支配，獲得意外的成功。而維多利亞女王在位穴十年間的軍國大事，以至兒女私情，莫不包羅廣博，鉅細靡遺。導演威爾考克司以簡鍊的手腕，精湛的技術，處理這些龐大而又複什的塲面，使觀衆覺得井井有條，足當聚手而無媿。</p>
<p>此片雖與「維多利亞女皇烈史」同一主角，同一史實，而「垂簾六十年」比之「女王烈史」實在要偉大得多，富麗得多。這裏祗舉出其中若千特色：</p>
<p>維多利亞女王歸嬪阿爾伯親王，議院中人表示反對，而王意志堅法。不爲稍動，愛娜妮格兒演來，極爲得體。</p>
<p>女王結婚大典時的盛大舞會，莊嚴富麗，古色古香。</p>
<p>維多利亞女王騎馬閱兵，打破英國乘輦閱兵的傳統觀念。雖朝廷大臣力阻，女王均置若罔聞，此塲極盡煊染現麗之能事。</p>
<p>維多利亞公主誕生，舉國歡騰，空前狂熱。阿爾伯親王主辦之博覽會—水晶宮開幕，珍奇羅列，蔚爲大觀。</p>
<p>維多利亞公主下嫁普魯士親王之盛典，宏偉瑰麗，與維多利亞女王自已之結婚大典，遙遙對照，後先輝映。</p>
<p>戈登將軍在「卡東」地方爲阿拉伯的土人國困，將軍以身殉國，壯烈情狀，令人奮發。</p>
<p>一八九七年，維多利亞女王在位六十年一鑽禧」紀念Diamond　Jubllce全英慶祝，舉國歡騰。情况之熱烈，置景之宏偉，銀幕上確屬罕見。</p>
<p>維多利亞女王駕崩，舉國哀悼，空氣的嚴肅靜穆，導演者有驚人的成就。綜女王之一生，英國的科學，美術，文藝，音樂，醫藥，俱有長足的進步，此片能有條不紊地顯示出椎多利亞女王當政時之種種功續。其偉大也正和維多利亞女王一樣。</p>
<p>此片不日獻映，爰摘其特色儘先奉吿游藝界讀者。</p>
<p>遊藝消息　慈淑大樓六百十七號民光俱樂部，雖創辦數月，然會員人數日見增加，該部爲提倡高尚娛樂，故參加會員均係各大學之學生，純粹研究平劇話劇與彈詞，現悉該部定於本月十八日晚七時至九時，假座赫德路四百十八號佛音廣播電台，播送平刺特別節目，屆時當有一番盛况，至於括劇，現正積極籌備中，聞不久即將登台表演。</p>

<h3>Defending the Great Northwest: China's Comprehensive Military Deployment; A Large Number of Elite Troops Stationed in the Hancheng-Tongguan Area; Rushing to Build River Defense Works and Striving to Consolidate the Periphery; The War Zone Headquarters Established a Supervision Group to Mobilize Mass Work</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shaanxi News, China is defending the Great Northwest with comprehensive military deployments. It is not easy for the Japanese to cross the Yellow River. Only Jin Southwest and Sui South, located on the bends of the river, are potentially passable. However, Sui South has mostly desert terrain after crossing the river, while Shaanxi North and Henan West have mostly mountainous terrain. Therefore, defending the Northwest, the Guanzhong area is critically important. This section of river defense includes Hancheng, Heyang, Pingmin, Chaoyi, Tongguan and other counties. Currently, China has stationed a large number of elite troops in the Hancheng-Tongguan area, and there are also mechanized troops. River defense works are also under construction. At the same time, troops have been sent to Sui Southwest, Henan, and Hubei Northwest to consolidate the periphery. (Special Dispatch at 1:00 AM on the 18th)</p>

<h3>Plainclothes Japanese Police in Tianjin Are Kidnapping People Everywhere</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>China's Creditworthiness and British and American Interests</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance of China announced the day before yesterday that it will no longer provide concessions for the repayment of foreign debts secured by customs duties, but will only allocate funds proportionally from the customs revenue of areas outside the war zone. Most of the Chinese government's foreign debts and reparations are secured by customs duties; domestic debts are secured by salt taxes or consolidated taxes. Newly issued domestic and foreign debts are mostly secured by direct taxes such as income tax; the Unity and Reconstruction Bonds and the Gold Bonds are also secured by customs duties. Now that China is no longer providing advances for foreign debts secured by customs duties, it will affect the interests of Britain and the United States; on the other hand, it seems that China's creditworthiness is also in question. We are willing to take a third-party position and make a rational analysis.</p>
<p>First, the Ministry of Finance-managed foreign debts secured by customs duties (as of January 1, 1939) include the Reorganization Loan, the Anglo-German Supplementary Loan, the British Boxer Indemnity, and the Sassoon Huai River Loan, totaling £24,611,367; and the Sino-French Boxer Indemnity and the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity, totaling US$25,546,000. It can be seen that as a result of the Japanese seizure of customs duties, it is Britain and the United States, not China, that suffer the losses, especially Britain. Recalling that in 1938, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and the Japanese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Horiuchi, discussed the handling of the Shanghai customs duties issue. The Anglo-Japanese agreement on Chinese customs duties signed on May 3 stipulated that all customs revenue in areas under the control of the Japanese military will be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, from which the amount needed to repay foreign debts will be allocated to the Inspector General of Customs to fulfill the obligation of repaying foreign debts and indemnities secured by customs duties. However, in fact, only one million yuan was repaid for the Reorganization Loan after the agreement was signed, and other foreign debts were not repaid at all. At that time, Britain was satisfied with this agreement, so that China could not freely dispose of the customs revenue even after protesting. Today, China no longer provides advances for debts secured by customs duties. Although the motivation does not include the meaning of resistance, it cannot be regarded as illegitimate in law.</p>
<p>Second, the Chinese government has made its best efforts to maintain its foreign debt reputation in recent years. For example, in October 1936, the Fisk Aircraft and Marconi Wireless Loan were reorganized. In April 1937, the Chicago Bank Loan and the Taiping Development Company Loan were successively established for repayment, designating salt tax as security. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all customs revenue in the war zone has been seized by Japan and deposited in Japanese banks; as a result, the accumulated amount of debts owed by each customs office in the war zone that should have been shared and not paid, which was advanced by the Central Bank after negotiation with the Chinese government, reached as much as 175 million yuan. It can be seen that the Chinese government has been trying its best to maintain its creditworthiness even during the war. Since the customs duties are seized by Japan, making it impossible for China to fulfill its debt repayment obligations, in essence, it is not that China wants to default on its debts, and therefore there is naturally no obligation to provide advances for repayment.</p>
<p>Third, the Ministry of Finance of China no longer providing advances for customs duties-secured loans does not mean that there is a flaw in China's anti-Japanese financial situation, resulting in the inability to maintain creditworthiness. The starting point is entirely an economic war of self-defense, avoiding Japan from using China's financial resources as a tool of aggression. Therefore, after making every effort to maintain the interests of Britain and the United States, it cannot continue to maintain the interests of Britain and the United States while simultaneously financing the enemy. Therefore, this is a necessary measure during wartime, and the reason is not in finance. In September 1938, China temporarily suspended the repayment of principal on the Crisp Loan and the Anglo-French Loan because Japan seized all salt taxes in the war zone, which was also the same reason.</p>
<p>Fourth, although the Ministry of Finance of China does not allow any more concessions for customs duties-secured loans, it is still doing its best to maintain its creditworthiness in order to avoid harming the interests of Britain and the United States. In the Ministry of Finance's statement, it has clearly stated that in the future, for all long-term debts borrowed before the war and secured by customs duties, the amount to be shared proportionally according to the customs revenue of the non-war zone customs offices will be handed over to the Central Bank on a regular basis. If the customs offices in the war zone hand over the unpaid amounts owed for sharing compensation as before, the Chinese government will still allocate debt repayment funds as before to restore the situation before the war. Therefore, if Britain and the United States do not maintain their interests in the Far East, if they really have the determination to maintain their interests in the Far East, they should cooperate to sanction Japan, so that China's customs administration is independent, complete, and free, which indirectly means that their own interests are reasonably maintained and protected.</p>
<p>In short, China's decision not to provide advances for debts secured by customs duties this time is not due to the financial difficulties of the anti-Japanese war affecting the inability to maintain creditworthiness, but entirely the result of Japan's seizure of customs revenue. In fact, there is nothing to criticize. We only hope that Britain and the United States can have a more detailed analysis and a deeper understanding of the overall situation in the Far East for their own interests, and realize that their creditor's rights are in danger due to Japan's aggression. No longer ignore it, but take more effective measures to jointly sanction Japan, and take extremely rapid action. Not only will its creditor's rights - all its interests in China - be reasonably maintained and protected!</p>
<h3>Rights and Interests in the Far East Are Endangered; Democracies Should Respond Jointly; France Will Follow in the Footsteps of Britain and the United States in Sending a Note to Japan; Tokyo Expresses Determination to Implement Basic Policy</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the need to respect the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington, after the United States and Britain successively presented notes to the Japanese government, it is rumored that the French government will also present the same note to Japan in the short term, demanding respect for the Nine-Power Treaty and making a clear statement on its policy towards China. This has now been confirmed by French officials. (Havas Dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(London) According to British political sources, France will present a note to Japan in the near future to express the close cooperation between Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East. It is said that the content of the French note is similar to the one presented by Britain on January 14, asking Japan to explain its plans. British officials confirmed yesterday that before presenting the note, Britain will inform the United States and France of the content of the note, and the wording of the note has received the "explicit approval" of the U.S. government. (Haitong Dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from various Japanese circles here, the Japanese government will respond to Britain and the United States' notes on China affairs within the next few days. It is claimed that the note suggests that the relevant powers may discuss amending the principles of open door and equal opportunity in the Nine-Power Treaty. However, it is difficult to resolve issues that are difficult to resolve through bilateral talks through multilateral negotiations. Various Japanese circles here believe that Britain and the United States are not aware of the irrationality of conference diplomacy or are motivated by a predetermined policy and want to use the shortcomings of conference diplomacy. However, Japan and Britain and the United States have a traditional friendship, so the Japanese government is prepared to negotiate on the British and American proposals under the following conditions: (1) Complete liberation of all Eastern countries, including the elimination of China's colonial status and the freedom of Eastern people to travel and reside; (2) Complete freedom of world trade, including the abolition of existing economic blocs and the abolition of tariff barriers and import quotas; (3) Fair redistribution of raw materials, including</p>
<p>Including free purchases of raw materials essential to national survival, and safeguarding natural resources necessary for national defense. Japanese circles also stated that Japan will dispel the anxiety and doubt expressed in the British and American notes regarding the British and American view of Far Eastern affairs. In other words, if Britain, the United States, and other third countries accept the above conditions, then all restrictions imposed by Japan, Manchukuo, and China on Britain, the United States, and other third countries in making legitimate efforts to "engage in economic activities necessary to defend their natural defenses and achieve their economic autonomy" will naturally be eliminated, and at the same time, China's semi-colonial status can also be abolished.

<h3>Hiranuma Will Elucidate Policy in the Diet</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the semi-official Japanese news agency, Prime Minister Hiranuma will deliver a speech in the Diet on the 21st of this month, stating the Japanese government's decision on its China policy. If the Nationalist government led by General Chiang Kai-shek does not abandon its policy of resistance to Japan, Japan will not hesitate to use various methods to destroy it. As for any Chinese people who understand Japan's goals and are prepared to participate in the work of reconstruction, Japan welcomes cooperation with them. At the same time, Japan is prepared to cooperate closely with countries that recognize Japan's position in the Far East, because the goal of this Sino-Japanese war is not so much to fight for military victory as to revive China and transform East Asia. Hiranuma's conclusion will strongly advocate the necessity of concentrating national forces, developing national defense, and increasing production. Sima Zhao's intentions are obvious.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources here, Wang Jingwei set off for Europe on January 14th. The details are unknown. Quan Cheng's side cannot confirm it either. (Haitong Dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, Wang Jingwei left Hanoi for Haiphong a few days ago and has now taken a French ship from Haiphong to Europe (Reuters Dispatch on the 17th) According to the French Shanghai General Daily, Japanese sources previously stated that Wang Jingwei's close associates had told the Japanese that Wang had already fled. However, according to a Hanoi telegram yesterday, Wang's close associate Zeng Zhongming made a statement to the Japanese, saying that Wang Jingwei was still in Hanoi on Saturday evening (January 14), but his residence had been moved three times. At the same time, according to British sources, Wang Jingwei is indeed still in Hanoi and is conducting "peace" negotiations with several Japanese representatives. In short, Wang's whereabouts are now a mystery. (Reuters News Agency)</p>
<h3>England Maintains Friendship with China, Chinese Public Opinion Expresses Gratification</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Ta Kung Pao's editorial today roughly states: All Chinese people who read the British note to Japan were greatly delighted, even more so than Britain's financial assistance to China. This note has swept away all kinds of misunderstandings held by the Chinese people regarding Britain's Far Eastern policy. The Chinese people now know that Britain will never abandon justice or friendship with the Chinese people. We can assure the British people that the Chinese people have always respected their friendship with Britain and will never forget Britain's friendship towards China in the critical moments of their history of survival, and will definitely find a way to fully repay it. This morning, all newspapers published the full text of the British note, unanimously praising Britain's attitude. The part of the note that analyzes the near-term peace conditions of Japanese Prime Minister Konoe in clear terms, considering them an attempt to encroach upon Chinese territorial sovereignty, is widely circulated among the Chinese people. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs now claims that the major signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, Britain, the United States, and France, now hold the same views on how to deal with the Far Eastern situation, which is very gratifying. To stop Japan's aggression in China and maintain the status quo in the Far East as stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty, the united action of these three countries is indispensable. The Central Daily News also published an editorial, stating that Britain's Far Eastern policy has now reached the final stage of decision-making, and what is needed now is action. If Britain raises its voice in Geneva, other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, including the United States and China, will definitely rise up to support its position. If Britain decides to take action, it can re-establish its leading position in the Far East for the next hundred years and gain China's great market, not only protecting its existing interests in the Far East.

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting Discusses China's Appeal, Gu Weijun to Attend and Speak, Chinese and Russian Representatives Meet and are Satisfied</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The 104th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council was held here yesterday. Today, at the second open meeting in the afternoon, it will deal with China's application for sanctions against Japan. At that time, Gu Weijun, the Chinese Ambassador to France and chief representative to the League of Nations, will attend and speak. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a secret meeting this morning and adopted the agenda for this session of the Administrative Council. The Chinese representative, Gu Weijun, visited the Soviet representative for talks, and the result was quite satisfactory. At noon today, Representative Gu attended a lunch hosted by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, and then visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet. The general impression of the League of Nations is that after the talks between the representatives of China, Britain, and France, this session of the League of Nations Administrative Council will draft a resolution based on the final notes sent by Britain and the United States to Japan. At the same time, it is widely believed that France will follow the example of Britain and the United States and issue a note to Japan. This morning, when reporters asked the French Foreign Minister whether France would make further statements on the Far East issue, the French Foreign Minister did not respond.

<p>(Chongqing) Zhu Jiaju, Chairman of the China Association of the League of Nations and Confidential Secretary of the Kuomintang, delivered a speech at a reception held here yesterday afternoon, urging the League of Nations to prevent the supply of munitions and financial credit to Japan and to provide financial and economic assistance to China, and to facilitate transportation with China, including maritime transport. Zhu advocated that countries with interests in the Far East should convene a meeting to supplement the inadequacy of the League of Nations' actions regarding the Sino-Japanese War. Wang Shijie, Vice Chairman of the Association and former Minister of Education, stressed that Japan's position is becoming weaker, and countries should not fear being drawn into war against Japan by strictly implementing sanctions.

<h3>Executive Yuan Meeting Yesterday Passes Report on Spanish War, Foreign Soldiers of the Government Have All Withdrawn, Representatives Hope Rebels Will Do the Same</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The 104th session of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened at 5 p.m. yesterday, chaired by Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler. The report submitted by the International Investigation Committee on the withdrawal of foreign volunteer soldiers from the Spanish Republican Government was immediately passed. The main points of the report stated that all foreign volunteer soldiers belonging to the Spanish government forces had been quickly withdrawn from the front lines, of which 76.7%, or 4,640 people, had already left Spain, and the remaining 53% had not yet been able to leave due to incomplete passport procedures. French Representative Foreign Minister Bonnet then delivered a speech, praising Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín for his contributions to general peace, but said that the Spanish Nationalist government should also take the same measures so that the situation in the Mediterranean could be stabilized. As for France, it has assisted Spain based on humanitarianism, and recently donated 45,000 tons of wheat to the Spanish government to help refugees, which is one example. Belgian Prime Minister Spaak, British Foreign Secretary Halifax, and New Zealand Representative Jordan then spoke, all advocating that foreign volunteer soldiers belonging to the Spanish Nationalist government should also be withdrawn. Soviet Representative Sulich, the Soviet Ambassador to France, expressed sympathy to the Spanish Republican government and said that the responsibility for the failure to completely withdraw foreign volunteer soldiers from Spain should be borne by the Nationalist army. Finally, Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Del Vayo delivered a speech, roughly saying, "All the troops within the Republican government's jurisdiction who are fighting for independent sovereignty are Spanish."

<h3>Copy of British Note Sent to Washington, Hull Refuses to Comment</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull told reporters that the Nine-Power Treaty regarding Washington should be treated with importance.

<h3>British Press Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan, Believes Effects Will Be Hundreds of Times Greater Than British Note</h3>
<p>(London) "Financial News" stated in an editorial today that the British note to Japan is like an admonition, lacking effective sanctions. Does the British government naively believe that the Japanese authorities at this stage will change their policies at the wave of a teacher's finger? The future of the two to three hundred million pounds of investment is now threatened, and words alone cannot protect it. Things have now reached this point. If the British government wants to maintain an attitude of non-intervention in the Far Eastern war, and hope to salvage the interests endangered by the war, it is impossible. Even seeking to preserve one-tenth of the interests is slim. If Britain and the United States take a common policy to resist the import and export trade between Japan and British-controlled regions, the effect will be hundreds of times greater than a diplomatic note, because Japan's foreign trade is the lifeblood of Japan's economy.

<h3>Japanese Press Opposes Britain, Even Deeming it a "Covert Enemy"</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After Britain issued a note to Japan, the tone of the Japanese newspapers' responses was extremely sharp. They all claimed that as long as Britain does not recognize Japan's mission in the Far East and continues to secretly aid General Chiang Kai-shek, there is no possibility of understanding between Britain and Japan. "Hochi Shimbun" criticized the British note as absurd and declared that Japan should follow the example of the Soviet Union in abolishing all treaties and Germany and Italy in abolishing the Treaty of Versailles and directly abolish the Nine-Power Treaty. "Nichinichi Shimbun" declared that if Britain continues to support the government of Chairman Chiang, Japan will regard it as a "covert enemy." (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>German Press Criticizes Weaknesses of British and American Notes</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German press commented today on the British and American notes to Japan, calling them a more sharp tone taken by Britain and the United States against Japan and saying that the Anglo-Saxon nations are uneasy about the establishment of political, economic, and cultural groups between China and Japan and Manchuria. They still say that Britain and the United States do not intend to intervene militarily. They may be good at wording in the notes, but in terms of implementation, Japan is more successful.

The recent offensive by the Nationalist army will not have the slightest impact on the strength or combat effectiveness of the government army. The Spanish government solemnly declares that even with the powerful intervention of foreign infantry armed with sophisticated weapons and the efforts of authoritarian countries to destroy the Spanish Republic, the Spanish people will still bravely resist until they defeat the invaders and the ultimate goals of their Spanish allies." (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: Yesterday, when Nationalist planes soared over the skies of Barcelona, hundreds of women were proudly marching through the streets filled with refugees, encouraging the public to persevere. The women carried flags with the slogans "Defend Catalonia" and "Defend Catalonia to the Death." Five Nationalist bombers dropped twenty large bombs in the port area, about half of which fell into the sea, but four bombs hit workers' apartments in the city, injuring five people.

<h3>One of Four New French Battleships of 35,000 Tons Completed, Christened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Port Brest: The 35,000-ton battleship "Richelieu" was launched here this morning. Naval Minister Campinchi and many other dignitaries were present to watch. Minister Campinchi is also scheduled to hold a keel-laying ceremony this afternoon for the "Richelieu"'s sister ship, the "Clemenceau" (named after the Tiger Premier during the European War). According to the plan set by the Ministry of the Navy, France must build four 35,000-ton battleships before 1942, namely "Richelieu," "Clemenceau," "Jean Bart," and "Gascogne." The "Richelieu" is 245 meters long and 33 meters wide, carries 60 officers and 1,500 soldiers, and has an average speed of at least 31 knots per hour. The hull is protected by armor to withstand cannon shells and torpedoes.

<h3>German Diplomatic Activities Actively Woo Allied Countries</h3>
<p>Hungarian Foreign Minister Talks at Length with Hitler, Withdrawal from League of Nations Only a Matter of Time, German Foreign Minister Scheduled to Visit Warsaw</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky arrived here, he had a long talk with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for two hours. Before traveling, former Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös paid a visit to Führer Hitler. When Foreign Minister Csáky met with German dignitaries, he performed the "Hungarian Greeting," placing his right hand on his chest. People generally felt interested in this. According to German semi-official sources, Foreign Minister Csáky and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop discussed various issues between Germany and Hungary in a very friendly spirit today. Hungary's decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact shows that the policies promoted by the Rome-Berlin Axis and the activities between the anti-communist triangle of Germany, Italy, and Japan are fully accepted by Hungary. All outstanding issues between Germany and Hungary can be easily resolved. Informed sources said that Foreign Minister Csáky's trip has no special significance, but Hungary's withdrawal from the League of Nations is only a matter of time. As for whether Foreign Minister Csáky's visit has anything to do with this matter, they declined to express their views. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>No Competitive Selling of Chinese Bonds on the London Market</h3>
<p>(London) There is no competitive selling of Chinese bonds. The general impression is that China will be able to find a way to recognize the Anglo-Japanese agreement of May 3 without damaging its borrowing in the current shift in British and American policy, which is beneficial to China. The Times said that regardless of the surplus or deficit in customs revenue, the Chinese government has always upheld the special status of debts secured by customs duties. Now that it is facing an unprecedented difficult situation, everyone is willing to continue to sympathize with it. However, although the Chinese government's acceptance of a compromise solution that may not be the same as the Anglo-Japanese agreement seems like a concession, it is less harmful to China than ignoring its debts. There is reason to believe that the Chinese government will adopt a suitable political view for China's real needs. The Daily Herald claimed that people in London fully recognize the Chinese government's natural interest in not making concessions, but when weighing the two evils, concession is less harmful. The Daily Mail suggested that the solution to this matter is for the Chinese government to stop repaying the principal and continue to pay interest. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Naval Circles Strongly Advocate for Enhanced Defenses on Guam Island, Extensive Establishment of Naval Bases in the Pacific, Requesting Congressional Appropriation to Implement the Plan</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the U.S. Navy publicly urged Congress to immediately allocate funds to implement the plan outlined in the Hepburn Report, emphasizing the importance of defending Guam. Guam is located in the center of the Japanese-controlled islands and is only 1,500 miles from the Japanese mainland. Disregarding the Japanese Navy's recent expression of "deep concern" regarding the U.S. defense of Guam, a U.S. Navy spokesperson stated today that Guam is a fortress that should be defended immediately to provide a base of operations in the Far East and to assist in the national defense along the coast. The spokesperson said, "The U.S. Navy intends to build Guam into a strong fleet base. In 1946, we will abandon the Philippines. After abandoning it, we will inevitably seek another suitable base in the Far East, otherwise we will be reduced to a second-rate power. Guam is our land, and since we have no intention of abandoning it, why not defend and protect it?" While naval experts continue to draft plans for expanding naval bases in the Pacific and Caribbean, senior officials and members of Congress have differing opinions on the issue of defending Guam. It is said that the main opponents of this plan come from the State Department, who are apparently concerned about the Japanese statement regarding "deep concern" about defending Guam. The Navy Department is working with the Budget Bureau to draft legislation that would allow the recommendations in the Hepburn Report for the establishment of forty-one naval bases to be implemented. Observers in Congress believe that the Navy has secured funding for the construction of the forty-one bases, but there may be a strong debate in Congress over the defense of Guam. The Navy's informal rationale for defending Guam is that concentrating strong air power and submarines on the island would allow for a large encirclement of the Japanese Navy advancing south or west. The Hepburn Report also states that with this base, the Philippines could be spared from attack, and any difficulties in defending the U.S. coast and Hawaii could be reduced, and the U.S. Navy's ability to operate freely would be greatly increased. (U.S. Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>(New York) The National Aeronautic Association continued its annual meeting today. Air Force Chief of Staff General Andrews attended and delivered a speech, saying, "If the United States does not strengthen its air defenses, then in the event of war, enemy aircraft capable of flying back and forth between Europe and the Americas will target U.S. industrial centers and ordinary people for bombing." Aircraft manufacturing is changing rapidly. Compared to future bombers, the super bombers that the United States currently possesses are insignificant. As far as the current state of our country's aircraft factories is concerned, I believe they are capable of building giant bombers capable of flying 16,000 kilometers in one go. Why can't other aircraft factories do the same? And it is to be expected that they will work hard to do so. Moreover, in terms of the current strength of the U.S. Air Force, it ranks only fifth or sixth in the world. The Air Force Chief of Staff can only deploy 400 aircraft. In the future, we must work actively to manufacture fighter planes and improve air defense facilities along the Atlantic coast to ensure security." (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Pursues Movement to Amend Silver Purchase Act, Silver Bloc Congressmen Offer Much Support</h3>
<p>(New York) According to Washington sources, a strong movement is underway in Congress to significantly amend the Silver Purchase Act, with attention being paid to proposals to prohibit the Treasury Department from purchasing foreign silver. Silver bloc Congressmen are offering much support for this movement, as they deeply fear that large-scale purchases of foreign silver will leave domestically produced silver with nowhere to be sold. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau mentioned this matter when he received reporters yesterday, saying that the Senate has not consulted him regarding the proposal to cease purchasing foreign silver. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Proposes Prohibition on Steel Exports</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Democratic Senator Schwellenbach proposed in Congress today that the export of steel and scrap iron from the United States should be prohibited, except with the express permission of the President. Political figures believe that this proposal is clearly intended to prevent Japan from purchasing scrap iron from the United States, and if it is implemented, it will deal a significant blow to Japan.

<h3>Mysterious Explosions Occur on the Same Day in London and Northern Ireland, Police Investigate Suspected Political Background, Prelude to Terrorist Actions by the Irish Republican Army</h3>
<p>(London) After an explosion occurred at the Southwark power plant in this city yesterday morning, another explosion occurred at the Birmingham City power plant (located near the water tower) yesterday evening. The material damage appears to be significant. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Metropolitan Police are now investigating two mysterious explosions in London. The more serious incident occurred outside the management office of the Southwark Central Electricity Station. Although no one was injured, countless doors and windows were shattered. An explosion of a similar nature also occurred in the Harlesden area of northwest London, where an overhead power line passes over a canal bridge. Judging from the circumstances of the two incidents, they were likely caused by bombs. Explosives experts from the Home Office are working with the police to investigate. According to police speculation about these explosions, they may have a political background. One theory is that they are related to disturbances organized by the "Irish Republican Army." The police previously received reports stating that if the Irish question could not be resolved in both Northern and Southern Ireland, disturbances might occur in England. Three explosions also occurred in Manchester yesterday, killing one person and injuring three. The roads were blown into giant craters, and many doors and windows were shattered. Although the cause of these explosions is said to be electrical faults, investigations are still ongoing because they occurred at the same time as the explosions in London. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Dublin: Following the explosions in London, Manchester, and Belfast, Northern Ireland, well-informed sources here commented, "This is the beginning of a terrorist campaign by the Irish Republican Army. The goal is to demand the withdrawal of British troops from Northern Ireland. The declaration by the Irish Republican Army to establish an Irish Republic is essentially an ultimatum." In addition, the Irish Republican Army is said to have large-scale terrorist organizations in England and Scotland. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Northern Ireland Home Secretary Sir Dawson Bates, in referring to the statements issued by the "Irish Republican Government" and the "Irish Republican Army" claiming the existence of an Irish Republic, said that the recent acts of violence on the Northern Ireland border were undoubtedly the beginning of this movement. The Northern Ireland government has long been aware of their plans for violence, and therefore, it has become necessary to detain the leaders of the "Irish Republican Army." The Northern Ireland government will not delay in fulfilling its responsibilities and will not hesitate to exercise its powers. If necessary, the government will seek to increase its powers to curb the criminal activities of illegal societies and eliminate all acts of violence and murder, thereby achieving its political goals.

<h3>Internal Unity in the Soviet Union, Full Effort to Cope with the Crisis, Soldiers Swear Allegiance to the Government, Youth Groups Become Militarized</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The movement to purge reactionary elements in the Soviet Union has eased after the removal of Yezhov, the People's Commissar for Internal Affairs and head of the political police. Since the Munich Agreement, the government has shifted its focus from domestic politics to international relations, mobilizing national strength to cope with external crises. The major measures include: 1. Stricter enforcement of labor discipline. 2. Army soldiers are required to individually swear allegiance to the Soviet government and sign a declaration stating that they are willing to be punished by federal law and despised by the nation's citizens and workers if they betray their oaths. 3. All youth groups, including the Communist Youth League, are controlled by government committees and militarized. 4. In addition, although the 1938 production plan is smaller than the 1937 plan, the planned production quantities have still not been fully met, and the government has taken various measures to prevent production declines.

<h3>The East River Chinese Army Encircles Shilong, Zhang, Tan, and Ye's Troops Advancing Sharply, Japanese Army Changes to Supplying by Waterway</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: According to battlefield news from Huiyang, water and land transportation in the counties along the East River has resumed since New Year's Day. Passengers and goods from Xingning and Heifeng can travel directly to Bao'an and Hong Kong via Laolong and Huiyang without any obstacles. Huang Renhuan is inspecting various counties, instructing on the construction of highways and telegraph poles, and dividing areas for joint defense and mutual assistance. The section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway from Changshentou to Shenzhen is being controlled by the Chinese army. Zhang Ruigui, Tan Sui, and Ye Ting's three units are attacking Shilong from three directions. Tan's division advanced to Hengli Bridge. Wu Daonan, the brigade commander of the Security Brigade, and Yuan Xiajiu, the special service battalion of the Eastern Route, attacked Chashan, Dongguan from Longgang and Dashawei. Another route was taken by Ye Ting's troops, who bypassed Mount Luofu in Boluo to attack Shilong. On the night of the 28th of last month, a plainclothes team attacked Shilong, engaging in street fighting until dawn before retreating. On the 31st, they approached Shilong again, cutting off the Japanese army's rear lines. Fierce battles occurred between Zengcheng and Conghua from the 31st, where the Japanese army's Nomura, Fukuda, and Takahashi units suffered heavy losses in Taipingchang and Rongshupu. On New Year's Day morning, the Japanese army counterattacked towards Dagangling and Shuicao, engaging in fierce battles with Liang Shiji and Kong Kequan's divisions in the villages of Shangang and Shabei. Both sides engaged in artillery battles all day. The Japanese army reportedly built defensive fortifications in the mountainous areas of Chicao, Duncun, Sanbaidong, and Gouer. The battles continued until the evening of the 2nd, when the Japanese army retreated towards Zengcheng. A regiment of infantry and a large battalion of artillery that entered Zengcheng seemed determined to hold it. The Wang Dequan, Peng Linsheng, Chen Gongxia, Liang Shiji, Hua Zhenzhong, Kong Kequan, and other divisions of the Guangdong Army that withdrew from the Yangtze River have moved south along the Yuehan Railway and arrived at the northeastern front, advancing towards Shangang and Guizui. Also, on the 31st, Changning, Futian, and Lianhe were recaptured by the Chinese army. Currently, Huang Tao's division, comprising the three brigades of Lian Tisheng, Chen Fengzhao, and Wen Shuhai, is surrounding Zengcheng. These three brigades are also under the command of Zhang Ruigui. The Guangdong Army is simultaneously surrounding Shilong and using large forces to pressure the front lines of Zengcheng and Conghua. Furthermore, it is reported that nearly one hundred Japanese warships and motorboats are concentrated at the White Goose Pool in Guangzhou. Because the highways along the East River have been blown up by the Chinese army, and Shitan, Shilong, and Dongguan are surrounded by the Chinese army, the Japanese side has changed to supplying grain and machinery by waterway, landing at Taiping, Shuijing, and Humen to support Shilong. It is rumored that the Chinese army captured Zengcheng on the 6th, and the Japanese army retreated to Xintang, Da Mao Mountain, and Shitan, where they are currently in a stalemate. The fighting on the Shilong front is also fierce. Street fighting occurred in Shilong City on the 6th, and the Wanlong Highway Bridge was blown up. The war on the East River is progressing favorably for the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Hangzhou Panicked, There is Talk of Retreating</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Yamata, the Japanese commander in charge of Central China, has, due to the fact that the Japanese army stationed in various parts of Zhejiang Province has been repeatedly attacked by the Chinese army and has suffered heavy losses, and also because the Chinese army is about to launch a major counteroffensive along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, reportedly planned to withdraw the troops from Hangzhou. On the afternoon of the 12th, he sent a special envoy to Hangzhou to convene a meeting of military officers stationed in Hangzhou at his residence. The content of the meeting was extremely confidential. The next evening, the special envoy invited foreigners from various church groups and other organizations in Hangzhou to a banquet. During the banquet, the special envoy told those present that "the focus of the war has now shifted to the South China area, and there is no need to hold this place. We plan to transfer the troops. However, once the troops are transferred, the Chinese army will inevitably take the opportunity to enter. But once occupied by the Chinese army, there will inevitably be massacres. Therefore, we ask your groups (referring to churches, etc.) to quickly organize an international refugee shelter to provide protection," and so on. All the foreigners present did not express any opinion upon hearing this. It is heard that the special envoy's request for friendly nations to organize the so-called international shelter was decided after several discussions between the special envoy and Wang Ruiqing and others, the puppet governor of Zhejiang Province, for the sake of preserving their lives.</p>
<h3>Chinese Air Force Bombs Japanese Army Outside the South Gate of Yangzhou, Japanese Army is Empty, Total Number of Soldiers is Less Than Four Hundred</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: After the Japanese army in Yangzhou was transferred to invade Tiangchang and Deyi, it suffered heavy losses and the interior is extremely empty. At around 7:00 AM on the 7th, a Chinese bomber flew in from the west and circled in the air before dropping three bombs on the Japanese army's positions outside the South Gate, and then flew away safely. The Japanese losses are unknown, but the situation was extremely panicked. The Japanese army, unable to cope with the constant attacks from the Jinan team, dispatched fifty or sixty puppet pacification soldiers to Deyi to reinforce the defenses and protect the construction of the Yang (zhou) - Tian (chang) highway. Japanese military police commander Tsuchiya and special operations squad leader Gui Goro both went to deploy defenses. Currently, there are only two hundred and several dozen Japanese soldiers and more than one hundred puppet soldiers in Yangzhou, totaling less than four hundred.</p>
<h3>Battle Report of the New Fourth Route Army Recapturing Yanli Town, Commander's Instructions Before Departure, Political Instructor Taking the Lead</h3>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post" says: The Fourth Regiment of the New Fourth Route Army gathered in the mountains several miles outside Yanli (transliteration) Town, taking a day to rest, inspecting and wiping their guns. Experienced soldiers often showed smiles at the corners of their mouths, appearing excited, and often sang songs such as "Chop hard at the heads of the devils... Kill, kill." After dinner in the evening, they went to bed almost immediately. Before midnight, they were ordered to get up and assemble. At this point, all the new recruits knew that they were about to go into battle. At this time, the commander was already waiting, and began to speak in a gentle tone, saying, "We will attack Yanli Town. There are about one hundred enemies in the town, seventy rifles, and two machine guns. There is a small squad of enemies on guard on the east side of the town. There are no sentries otherwise. The enemies are all in the Great Temple in the center of the town. We will begin the attack before dawn. The terrain of the town is at the foot of a mountain, surrounded by roads. There are two small paths on the left side of the town. Eat at one o'clock, and prepare to depart at four o'clock. We will divide into four routes. One-third will take the offensive on the front, and two-thirds will attack from the sides using the small paths. Those taking the small paths must set out half an hour early and wait quietly for the attack. Those of us taking the offensive must use bayonets and hand grenades, and engage the enemy in close combat. Check your bayonets and hand grenades, and make sure they are ready." After the commander finished speaking, the political instructor stood up, raised his fist, and shouted, "Armed comrades, we are ordered to wipe out the enemies and drive them out of the country. How about it?" The soldiers shouted, "Of course, of course." The instructor shouted again, "There are not many enemies. We believe we can fulfill the order. We must do our best and annihilate the enemies before sunrise tomorrow. Then we will win a great victory." The soldiers all shouted, "Good, good." At three thirty, two teams began to advance towards the town along the small paths. At four o'clock, the third team also set out. They did not speak a word, and walked forward quickly. The commander and the political instructor took the lead and led the third team to within half a mile of the town, and a few hundred yards away, a Japanese sentry was walking back and forth. Two soldiers were dispatched to stab the Japanese sentry to death as quickly as possible. The commander then ordered the attack, and the political instructor raised his Mauser pistol and shouted, "Follow me," and the soldiers followed him forward. Although a few sentries put up a hasty fight, the attack was extremely rapid, and the sentries were immediately wiped out. At this time, the main force of the Japanese garrison in the Great Temple in the town had awakened and hurriedly put on their clothes, grabbed their guns, and resisted stubbornly. However, the other two teams had also attacked, attacking from both sides, simply and quickly. When the rising sun rose, the battle had ended, and the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth was raised high over the town. In this battle, sixty Japanese soldiers were killed, two were captured, and the rest escaped. On the New Fourth Route Army side, five people died for their country and were immediately buried. Fifteen were wounded and temporarily sent to the rear for treatment. The next day, a memorial service was held for the fallen, with two or three soldiers reporting on the battle and the glorious martyrdom of the five. A victory message was also reported to the General Headquarters, which also held a memorial service, with the political instructor giving a speech to those attending, saying that we must remember the fallen with our own courage and must take them as our example. Several days later, when the wounded soldiers were transferred to the hospital, the commander would personally comfort them and encourage them.</p>
<h3>The Japanese and Puppet Troops are Besieged in Linyi City, Japanese Troops on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are Moving Northeastward Day After Day, Many of the Old and Weak in the Hometown of Xiang Yu are Killed, Villagers in Shuanggou Organize a Non-Recognition Association</h3>
<p>Huaiyin Correspondence: The total number of Japanese and puppet troops in Linyi County, Southern Shandong, is approximately five hundred. Some time ago, they invaded Chuanjiazhuang, Sanguanmiao, Weitun, and Shilibao, all of which are subordinate to Linyi County. However, they were met with fierce counterattacks from the Chinese army and local self-defense forces and suffered heavy losses. Therefore, in recent days, they have only been able to huddle inside the city and have not dared to invade the countryside again. Unexpectedly, yesterday, more than two hundred puppet troops, accompanied by six fake cannons, led by Kuroda, fled along the Lintai Highway towards Taierzhuang. They were ambushed again by the Chinese army at Location X, with an estimated fifty Japanese soldiers killed. The survivors fled back in a panic and cowered inside the city. It has been found that there are approximately two hundred Japanese bandits and two hundred puppet troops in Linyi, for a total of less than six hundred. In the past two days, they have forcibly gathered local people to build a highway from Linyi to Taierzhuang in order to prevent the Chinese army and guerrillas from cutting off their retreat, as they have repeatedly tried to escape but have been ambushed by the Chinese army. Also, some time ago, the Japanese and puppet troops invaded Fujiazhuang, which is subordinate to Linyi, and also repaired the highway. It is also reported that the Japanese and puppet troops are actively repairing traffic routes, apparently intending to invade Tancheng and threaten Canghai. The Chinese army is now making careful preparations.</p>
<p>Xuzhou Intelligence: There are approximately five hundred Japanese soldiers in Xuzhou. Japanese troop trains are heading northeast on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway every day. There are approximately two hundred Japanese soldiers in Jing'an Town, northwest of Xuzhou.</p>
<p>Suqian News: The Suqian puppet Maintenance Society is located in the North Warehouse Elementary School. The chairman is Chen Jingli (nickname Chen Fu Dwarf), the vice-chairman is Xu Chengkui, and the propaganda team leader is He Chunting. The Japanese army went to the refugee shelter at the Catholic Church in Suqian to take away seventy to eighty refugees, and their whereabouts are unknown. Near the former residence of Xiang Yu south of the city, more than one hundred elderly female refugees were killed. Wang Yan, who was already eighty years old, was also killed under his bed.</p>
<p>Shuanggou News: The villagers in the area are deeply angered by the looting of the puppet "Xixi County Government" and have secretly organized a "Non-Recognition Association." They do not recognize any organizations of traitors. The association has hundreds of guns and is strong. Traitor Zhang Dehui was killed by dozens of members of the "Non-Recognition Association" at the Xu Family Village northeast of Shuanggou. Zhang fled to Shuanggou with his head in his hands, and his henchmen went to ... entered ... by the Yellow River dike, and were met by the association ... gunfire suddenly erupted, and several puppet ... troops of the traitor were wounded.</p>
<h3>Eastern War Zone – Chinese Troops Strive to Recover Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Large Contingent of Chinese Troops Arrive at Haiyan – Japanese Spokesperson Admits Without Objection – Yuanhua Unscathed After Bombing</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, guerrilla warfare near the suburbs of Hangzhou has become increasingly active recently. Chinese troops have crossed the Qiantang River and reached the Haiyan area, numbering over 8,000. This number has been admitted by the Japanese spokesperson. However, the spokesperson remained silent about news from the front lines, further confirming that the news of the Chinese guerrilla forces' great victory is not a fabrication.</p>
<p>Suzhou Area – Heavy Losses for Japanese Troops</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that in the Suzhou area, the Chinese guerrilla forces engaged the Japanese troops in 309 battles, large and small, last winter. The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses, with a total of 4,505 deaths. The Chinese troops also seized a considerable amount of war booty, including 1,442 rifles, 328,000 rounds of ammunition, 70 machine guns, and a steamboat.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Near Suburbs – Transferred to Hangzhou and Jiaxing</p>
<p>The situation in Hangzhou is widely rumored to be extremely tense. Observations of the situation in the suburbs of Shanghai also support this. According to Chinese sources familiar with the suburbs, the number of Japanese troops in the suburbs of Shanghai has decreased significantly in recent days, with the majority being transferred to the Hangzhou and Jiaxing areas. Currently, the number of Japanese troops stationed near Shanghai is very small. For example, the Shanghai High School, located at the intersection of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway in western Shanghai, was originally an important stronghold for the Japanese troops in western Shanghai. Usually, the school housed over 500 Japanese troops, sometimes as many as 1,000 or 2,000, but now there are fewer than 100. Longhua has only a little over 100, Hongqiao has only about 20 injured, and Beixinjing has only a few dozen. The Lincoln Road Japanese Headquarters, which governs the defense of the Shanghai suburbs, including the Toyota Japanese troops, also has no more than 300 men. The defense is weak, an unprecedented situation since the withdrawal of the National Army from Greater Shanghai. As a result, guerrilla teams in western Shanghai have been very active recently. As for the eastern suburbs, the number of Japanese army troops has also decreased significantly, with the defense largely taken over by the Japanese navy. The Japanese military strength in the suburbs has been drastically reduced, so they mostly hold fast to their strongholds and dare not go out to prevent guerrilla attacks.</p>
<p>Attacks on Yuanhua – Still Unsuccessful</p>
<p>The Japanese troops have deployed reconnaissance posts along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, with guards of one or two sentries for security. Unexpectedly, in the last ten days, they suddenly strengthened their defenses, dismantling civilian houses along the line to obtain bricks and wood to build small bunker-style observation posts, manned by Japanese soldiers armed with machine guns. The situation is extremely tense. However, Chinese troops continue to arrive, crossing the railway as if entering an uninhabited area. The Japanese troops originally planned to attack Yuanhua in three routes, from Zijingshi, Haizha, and other places. One route still attacked Lujialan, and another route went to Baishiqiao and Xintangqiao, with minor clashes. The Japanese troops retreated back to Daoxi and other places. On the 2nd, 120 Japanese troops, using local collaborators as guides, advanced to near Maqiao, and made brief contact with Chinese troops, but dared not penetrate deeper and retreated immediately. On January 7th, Japanese aircraft dropped four bombs on Yuanhua Town. One fell on the firewood yard of the Cha Xijiu family, destroying one main beam. One fell on the Dafenzhou farmer's family, killing three sheep. One fell on the Hexiaofang Cha house, destroying a corner of the house. One fell on a match poplar tree at the Maiyuqiao bridge in Yuan Town, killing a dog. However, the Japanese troops have not forgotten the guerrilla forces in the Yuanhua area, and are still thinking of attacking.</p>
<h3>Sudden Rise in Rice Prices in Shanghai – Guilds Exert Utmost Effort to Suppress</h3>
<p>Reduced Inventory in Inland Areas and Higher Grain Prices – Japanese Smuggle Hundreds of Thousands of Units of Grain Monthly</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices in Shanghai have been soaring. Market forces are working hard to suppress them, and public sentiment has been somewhat stabilized. The price increase is entirely due to the Japanese army seizing rice in all locations, smuggling it out, leading to a reduction in the rice inventory in inland areas, and the Japanese puppet regime’s increasing taxes. The details have been investigated by a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Smuggling – Reduced Inventory</p>
<p>The Japanese army is carrying out large-scale seizure of rice in the occupied areas of Wuhu, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiujiang and Zhenjiang, smuggling approximately six to seven hundred thousand units per month. This rice is taken directly from farmers by force by threatening them to lower the market price. Then it is shipped by ship to Hongkou, and then reloaded for export. Therefore, it is quite difficult to exercise the functions of customs officials within the Japanese army's sphere of influence, so the Japanese army dares to be so bold. For several months, the inventory in inland areas has gradually decreased. Now it is the time when winter transitions to spring, and the supply of rice cannot meet the demand. The rice price in all locations has increased.</p>
<p>Delayed Supply – Rice Price Soars</p>
<p>Recently, after the price of rice in various producing areas has risen sharply, general traders and firms dare not import too much, fearing that they will suffer losses after arriving in Shanghai. At the same time, the Japanese army's increased collection of illegitimate taxes has further increased the burden on traders. Due to these various reasons, the supply of rice to Shanghai has suddenly stagnated. Currently, only four to five thousand units of rice are shipped from inland areas to Shanghai every day, while the daily sales in Shanghai are over ten thousand units. Since the transactions are not as numerous as before, the rice price has soared when the market opens every day. Compared with the transaction price last week, it has increased by sixty to seventy cents, with the best white rice approaching thirteen yuan. The high-quality indica rice from various firms is already approaching twelve yuan.</p>
<p>Market Suppression – Yesterday Slightly Returned to Normal</p>
<p>In view of the continuous increase in rice prices and the increasingly tense market situation, the Market Management Committee of the Bean and Rice Industry Association has specially set up suppression measures for the sake of maintaining the food supply for Shanghai residents. Therefore, after the market opened at 9:00 am yesterday, transactions were still frequent, and the market price continued to rise. After the market tried its best to push it back, it began to fall at the close of the market, which was similar to the market situation on the previous day (the 16th), and people's hearts gradually became stable.</p>
<h3>US Fleet Commander – To Go to Wuhu Today – US Consul General to Accompany</h3>
<p>US Fleet Commander Admiral Kimmel will take a warship up the Yangtze River today (the 18th) directly to Wuhu. US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, will accompany him. He is expected to return to Shanghai on the 24th.</p>
<h3>European Immigration to Shanghai – Has Become a Serious Problem</h3>
<p>London and New York Seem to Have No Hope of Assistance – Conference Is Financially Distressed and Finds It Difficult to Maintain</p>
<p>—More Than a Hundred People Have Received Capital to Do Business—</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that in September of last year, an International Committee for the Relief of European Refugees was established in this city, with the aim of raising funds to relieve European refugees coming to China. It does not discriminate against refugees based on nationality, race, or political belief. Prior to this, there was a group for the relief of German Jews coming to China. Because the two groups have the same purpose, they work closely together. The funds raised are sufficient to provide comfortable food and lodging for the refugees coming to Shanghai. However, at that time, the Levinah Jewish Organization said that China was affected by the war, and the refugee problem was quite serious, so Shanghai could not take care of the large number of refugees coming from abroad. However, immigrants from Central Europe continue to come to Shanghai, and the Jewish organizations already established in this city cooperate to take care of them. At the same time, the organizations sent letters and telegrams, reporting the serious refugee problem they encountered to charitable organizations in London, New York, Paris, Singapore, and other places. However, because these organizations also have to take care of Central European refugees and have their own complex problems, the assistance that this city receives from these organizations is very small, totaling only one hundred pounds from London, two thousand five hundred US dollars from New York, and several thousand units from Singapore and Hong Kong. However, the Shanghai organizations have requested assistance from the Shanghai Municipal Council, consulates, and the American Advisory Committee for the Relief of Chinese Civilians. The Advisory Committee also telegraphed the American Red Cross in Washington, D.C., requesting assistance. At the same time, the continued arrival of refugees in Shanghai is not only continuous, but also has the risk of being endless. A month ago, an Italian mail ship brought 550 people. Currently, there are about 1,750 people in Shanghai, and many more have already set out or purchased ship tickets, preparing to come to Shanghai. Neither Shanghai nor London nor Paris nor other organizations can stop it. The refugees who arrive in Shanghai all explain the reasons why they have to leave their old places. It is pointed out that it is difficult to prohibit these people from boarding the ships. The organizations in this city, due to financial constraints, telegraphed London, requesting immediate assistance and have received a reply, inquiring about the number of refugees who have arrived in Shanghai and are on the way, and the amount of funds required to maintain them. From this, it can be proved that the relief committees in this city can hope to receive assistance from overseas. However, to this day, two weeks have passed since the reply telegram, and judging from the actual situation directly obtained, London and New York seem unwilling to allocate funds to Shanghai. According to sources from responsible parties, the committees in this city have raised eleven hundred thousand units so far, but now it has all been used up. A small number of refugees can still get assistance from relatives and friends overseas, and some do not want to ask for assistance from the committee and sell their jewelry to make a living. However, over 90% are penniless and must rely on public donations. Only a small number of refugees have found jobs in this city. Some who have medical experience are hired by the committee to serve in inland hospitals. The committee is now considering that instead of continuing to provide food and lodging for these people, it would be better to provide some capital to enable them to do business themselves, so that they do not have to continue to give them food. This goal has greatly progressed after Sassoon donated one hundred thousand units. So far, 125 refugees have applied to resume their businesses and have been approved by the conference and have now begun their new lives in a foreign land. Other applicants are currently under investigation. This plan will be temporarily suspended only after the funds have been exhausted. However, there are still a large number of immigrants who have not been able to obtain jobs or who cannot do business in this city due to a lack of experience and language difficulties, and they still rely on the committee. The conference is financially distressed and finds it increasingly difficult to maintain them.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Northern District – Still a Distant Prospect</h3>
<p>The Japanese side said that it is still under discussion, but they cannot explain the details</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that yesterday (the 16th), when the Japanese side received reporters, a reporter asked the Japanese spokesperson what he had to report about the return of the area north of the Suzhou River to the management of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The spokesperson replied that it is currently under discussion. As for the rumor that the Japanese Residents Association has requested that the area be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Council, he had no information and could not explain under what circumstances the area could be recovered by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Dense Fog Hinders Navigation – Ships Blocked at the Wusong Estuary</h3>
<p>The English-language Great Evening Post reported that today (the 17th), news was received from Yokohama that the President Harrison was delayed for three days due to encountering a storm before finally arriving at Yokohama. At the same time, shipping in this city was also blocked at the Wusong Estuary and the Yangtze River Estuary due to dense fog. Around 10:00 am, not only had the fog not dissipated, but it seemed to have become even thicker. All ships, tugboats, and barges traveling to and from the sea were also affected.</p>
<h3>Bond Interest Paid by Chongqing – Bondholders Gladly Accept</h3>
<p>Central Bank Obeys Head Office Telegram – National Debt Committee Draws Lots as Usual</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance notified the customs authorities that the redemption and interest payment of the bonds would continue as usual, but the payment would be changed to the Chongqing head office. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>All Bondholders – Have No Objections</p>
<p>Bondholders who have domestic government bonds guaranteed by customs duties, trust certificates, gold bonds, etc., are grateful for the government's maintenance of creditworthiness and protection of bondholders' interests, and have repeatedly paid huge sums of money to pay on schedule. This is because the customs duties within the war zone have been seized and all deposited in Japanese banks. The Ministry of Finance announced that customs-guaranteed compensations would no longer be allowed to overdraw. They believe that this is a temporary measure to cope with the current extraordinary situation. If the government were to make long-term advances, it would be truly lacking, so they were happy to accept it without any objections.</p>
<p>Promulgation of Chongqing – Payment Method</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank sent a telegram to the Chongqing head office a few days ago to inquire about the case of the change in the redemption and interest payment of public bonds to Chongqing. A reply telegram has now been received. The redemption and interest payment of the five types of bonds A, B, C, D, and E of the unified public bonds due at the end of this month and the recovery public bonds due at the end of February will be paid in full by the Chongqing Central Bank head office. If bondholders want to receive the soft currency from the Shanghai Central Bank and the China and Communications Banks and the Central Trust Bureau entrusted by it, they must be paid in six installments. The detailed arrangements for the full payment of the Chongqing Laiqing and the Shanghai installment payments have been promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, but the above detailed arrangements have not yet arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Public Bond Draw – Held as Usual</p>
<p>All matters relating to the drawing and redemption of domestic public bonds are handled by the National Debt Gold Custody Committee. It is stipulated that a public bond drawing will be held in Shanghai every month. The sixth decision on the redemption of the Revival Public Bonds was held on the 10th of this month. The seventh redemption of the Unified Public Bond Class A Bond was scheduled to be held on February 10th. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Kid Committee that the Chongqing payment has been decided, but the detailed arrangements have not yet arrived in Shanghai. As for the subsequent unified, recovery, gold, and special public bonds, the drawings are held as usual because no order has been received from the Ministry of Finance. The government is determined to maintain its creditworthiness for internal savings.</p>
<p>Shanghai Installment – Reasons for Payment</p>
<p>A leader in the financial industry told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency that the government's maintenance of the credit of domestic public bonds has been consistent from beginning to end. The payment of interest in Chongqing is not overdue. Because all bondholders have the principal and interest due and can receive it in full from the Central Bank head office in Chongqing. As for the Shanghai installment payment method, because Shanghai is an occupied area, it is to prevent a huge amount from flowing in and the excessive amount of currency in the Shanghai market. At the same time, the government has already restricted the transfer of funds from the mainland to Shanghai. As of now, the Silver and Money Industry Association has not received an order from the ministry, but in fact, there is no need for the two guilds to forward the order. It is reported that the Central Bank has obeyed the order.</p>
<p>Bond Market Yesterday – Slightly More Stable</p>
<p>In the informal securities trading market in Shanghai, after the Ministry of Finance announced that the duty-guaranteed securities would no longer be allowed to overdraw, all bonds of the Unified Public Bonds fell across the board the day before. Yesterday, because it was rumored in the market that the Unified Public Bonds due at the end of this month would be paid as usual, and the payment of interest in Chongqing was not overdue, the bond market was slightly more stable, and the decline was less than one unit. The closing price of Category A bonds was 55.8 units, down 0.7 units from the previous day; Category B bonds were 49.5 units, down 0.5 units from the current day; Category C bonds were 48.8 units, down 0.2 units from the previous day; Category D bonds were 48 units, down 0.5 units from the previous day; and Category E bonds were 48.3 units, down 0.3 units from the previous day.</p>
<h3>After the Failure of the Japanese Puppets to Manipulate the Labor Movement – Ambitions Not Extinguished and Still Trying to Act</h3>
<p>Again Using Wang Jingwei's Name to Lobby Everywhere – Various Trade Unions Issue Declarations Rejecting Deception</p>
<p>The Japanese puppet regime, trying to manipulate the Shanghai labor movement, organized the "China Workers' Welfare Association" and urged trade unions to join, but was severely rejected. The association was unable to expand its affairs. The Japanese side has stopped providing subsidies, and the work has been suspended. In recent days, several members of the association have been active again, saying that they were entrusted by Jingwei to establish a labor movement organization in Shanghai to respond to the peace movement. Yesterday, various trade unions in the city issued a declaration, stating that they would strictly adhere to their positions and would not be tempted at all. The details have been investigated by a reporter from Modern News Agency as follows:</p>
<p>Pseudo Welfare Association – Work Suspended</p>
<p>The pseudo "China Workers' Welfare Association" hosted by the Japanese puppets is headed by Hu Shouchang, the pseudo "Social Director", with Lin Qijiong as the secretary-general, and the Japanese, Miyata Kyusho, as the instructor. Since it was announced "established" last year, it has used "relief of unemployment" as a slogan to tempt trade unions to cooperate. However, the persons in charge of the trade unions all understand the righteousness and strictly refused, causing the association to be helpless. So, they gathered some unemployed people and fabricated the names of trade unions, carrying out self-pulling and self-singing. As for the actual situation, it is completely empty and powerless. Hu Shouchang, Lin Qijiong, etc. took this to the Japanese to fraudulently obtain huge amounts of funds. Soon, the Japanese learned of the situation and immediately stopped the subsidies. The association, with no funds, fell into an invisible standstill.</p>
<p>Using Wang's Name – Attempting to Resume Activities</p>
<p>Ever since Wang Jingwei betrayed the party and the country and issued the "Yan telegram" in Hong Kong, advocating surrender and peace with Japan, it has aroused unanimous condemnation across the country. In order to rectify discipline and express the determination to resist, the central authorities have already expelled him from the party forever and removed him from all positions. Therefore, Jingwei is now despised by the people of the whole country. However, the Japanese puppets, thinking that he was once an advanced figure in the country, still tried to use him to complete their dream of peace. Recently, in order to do so, the "China Workers' Welfare Association" sent minions to act everywhere, claiming that they were authorized by Jingwei and enticing people with huge activity funds, planning to reduce the number of labor groups, hoping that various trade unions would participate. However, the truth of this ghost trick can only entice some ignorant workers. As for the responsible persons of each trade union, they can all discern the hidden dangers and have never paid attention to it.</p>
<p>Various Trade Unions – Issue Declaration</p>
<p>Yesterday, various trade unions in the city issued a joint declaration, saying that since the Japanese army moved out of Shanghai, the trade unions in the city, although limited by the environment, have automatically stopped political activities, but their loyalty to the party, the country, and their leaders has remained unchanged from beginning to end, and they will persist without wavering. They will spare no effort to eliminate any enticements or threats from the Japanese puppets. The organization of the pseudo "China Workers' Welfare Association" is only the behavior of some idle people in the name of fraud. The labor circles in the city have never participated in it. Recently, some people have used the name of Jingwei to organize workers' organizations in Shanghai, hoping to promote the "peace movement". Whoever proposed it and what the background is, is not difficult for discerning people to imagine. The labor circles in the city deeply understand the righteousness and will never be deceived by it. However, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be shameless people who borrow the name to sell out the country and try to deceive others. Therefore, we hereby solemnly declare to be observed by all circles.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Transactions in the Foreign Concessions:  Small Properties in the Western District Are More Active,  Central District Real Estate Remains Stagnant,  Investment Motives Also Differ From Before</h3>
<p>Shanghai is one of the world's ten major commercial ports and the most important port in East Asia.  Due to various special political and economic relationships, it has developed its unique character, promoted its unique development, and thus created its unique status.  In the ninety-odd years since the opening of the port, the population has increased daily, and land prices have soared.  In the past, the market price per mu was only 15,000 to 30,000 or 50,000 cash coins, but later it rose to 500,000 yuan per mu.  In the past, real estate was an important object for financial institutions to secure loans and for investment purposes.  However, since the "January 28th" incident, there has been a very significant decline, especially in the formerly prosperous Public Concession.  Since the "August 13th"</p>
<p>War Began</p>
<p>People from the inland areas have flocked to Shanghai to seek refuge, and since the Hongkou area has not yet been opened, it is said that both the northern and southern parts of the city have turned to ashes.  As a result, the population density in the safe areas of the concessions is unusually high.  Even the areas beyond the boundaries of the concessions, east of the railway line, have been completely rented out.  Therefore, Shanghai real estate, which had been sluggish for many years, has shown signs of activity again.  However, the nature of the real estate recovery after the war is</p>
<p>Different</p>
<p>From the previous real estate boom.  When land prices rose in the past, all investors were happy to buy, and it was very convenient to use it as collateral at brokerage firms.  Therefore, real estate transactions were very easy, consistently reaching around 10 million yuan per month.  Moreover, the larger the property and the better the location, the more valuable it was.  The post-war real estate activity has gone in the opposite direction.  The general public buys real estate only for residential or factory construction purposes.  Therefore, small properties in the French Concession and the Western District, with areas of one or two mu and with residential buildings, etc.,</p>
<p>Have Many Transactions</p>
<p>In addition, there have been some transactions in the areas along Yichang Road, Xiaoshadu Road, and Gordon Road, where land can be used for factory construction.  Their value is roughly close to the assessment of the Public Works Department, with better properties being 20-30% higher.  The monthly transaction volume was very small in the first four months of the war.  This is because there were fierce battles in the suburbs at that time, and people within the concessions were uneasy and had no time to consider real estate transactions.  Since May of last year, it has gradually become lively, with an average monthly transaction volume of</p>
<p>About One Million</p>
<p>Yuan.  However, these transactions mostly involve the Western District and small properties.  As for the Central District properties, there is very little activity, and prices remain low and have not risen.  For example, recently there was a piece of land on Hankou Road, with an area of two mu and three fen, which, according to the assessment of the Public Works Department, should be worth more than 287,000 taels, equivalent to 400,000 yuan in current currency.  However, it was recently sold for only 290,000 yuan, including the buildings, which is less than</p>
<p>30% Off The Assessed Value</p>
<p>Another example is a piece of land on Jing'an Temple Road, with an area of five mu and one fen, which, according to the assessment of the Public Works Department, is worth more than 410,000 taels, equivalent to more than 580,000 yuan in current currency.  However, the transaction price (last summer) was only 480,000 yuan, including excellent buildings, which is also only 30% off the assessed value.  In addition, a large property on Henan Road is recently willing to sell for half the assessed value of the Public Works Department, but it is said that it has not yet found a buyer.  It can be seen that the activity of Shanghai real estate is only</p>
<p>Limited To The Western District</p>
<p>And small properties, and cannot be regarded as a universal boom.  The current status of Shanghai is greatly related to the international situation.  In the event of a world war, it would inevitably affect Shanghai, and there is little certainty.  Moreover, the relationship between Britain, the United States, and Japan is deteriorating, and it is uncertain whether it will have any impact on the situation in Shanghai.  At the same time, the general public is</p>
<p>The Value of the Legal Tender</p>
<p>Although they were initially skeptical, after the government's efforts to maintain it, the value has become increasingly stable and trusted.  They are also unwilling to invest heavily in real estate, resulting in stagnant funds.  Therefore, it will take a considerable amount of time for the Shanghai real estate market to return to its past prosperity, and it cannot be achieved in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>General Manager of the Public Works Department, Fankerling, Did Not Visit Fu Xiao'an</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent report that the General Manager of the Public Works Department, Fankerling, visited "Fu Xiao'an," it has been learned that on the evening of the 9th of this month, "Fu Xiao'an" visited the General Manager at his private residence and met with him.  "Fu" immediately inquired about the British army's closure of the Huxi Da Xi Road Police Station.  Mr. Fan replied that he was unaware of it and did not comment on it.  "Fu" left after hearing this.  According to Mr. Fan, since August 13th, he has consistently maintained his neutral position.  Therefore, he is willing to meet with any personnel who can improve the local situation in Shanghai, such as eliminating bandits and gambling outside the boundaries of Huxi, and is very eager to do so.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Salaries for the Lone Army: Xie Jinyuan Makes a Solemn Statement: A Statement Has Been Issued by All Officers and Soldiers: All Account Books Will Be Audited by Accountants</h3>
<p>(Special Report from this Newspaper) Since the loyal and brave Lone Army of the Four Banks moved to Jiaozhou Park, all sectors have been extremely concerned about their current situation. A reporter from this newspaper met with Mr. Xie Jinyuan, the adjutant of the Lone Army regiment, yesterday, and discussed various matters in detail. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The reporter met Mr. Xie at his residence yesterday. Mr. Xie's heroic demeanor remained unchanged, but he appeared slightly thinner due to recent insomnia. He wore a neat and dignified blue suit made of domestically produced wool. The furnishings in the room were simple and unadorned, with many books on the desk. Mr. Xie initially studied engineering, then studied politics at the Whampoa Military Academy, and later joined the army. He recorded all matters in his diary. His personal life was very disciplined, and he abstained from things like tobacco and alcohol. His attitude was sincere and serious.</p>
<p>Mr. Xie first mentioned his recent insomnia, which had been examined by a doctor but the root cause had not yet been fully identified. However, he believed it was due to excessive mental stimulation. Since his unit's withdrawal from the Four Banks, he had been very grateful for the care and encouragement from people across the country. However, he believed that the duty of a soldier was to defend the country and protect the people. During this ongoing war of resistance, his unit had been unable to continue serving the country and the nation, which caused him deep unease. Currently, all the soldiers are on an isolated island, their hearts are with the country, and their fervent emotions cannot be expressed, which causes them mental distress. This is not only true for himself, but all the soldiers in the battalion share the same feeling. Under these circumstances, the soldiers are able to understand the environment and diligently engage in academic research and physical training, in order to serve the country in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Xie then recounted that when his unit was fighting in the Four Banks, he stayed awake for four days and nights to deal with everything. At that time, he was so nervous that he only knew that he had dedicated himself to the country and would not hesitate to sacrifice himself. Later, he was ordered to withdraw, and the entire unit broke through the encirclement. The number of sacrifices was less than expected. Even the wounded platoon leader was carried out by the soldiers in the midst of gunfire. This was also because the soldiers were able to understand the great righteousness of revolutionary soldiers, so they were able to overcome dangers as if they were on flat ground. When Mr. Xie spoke to this point, his emotions were very excited and also very sad. He also said that in the past year, he had been negotiating with various parties, adhering to the position of the country and the nation, hoping not to disappoint the ardent expectations of people across the country.</p>
<p>Regarding the external letter about the salary issue of the Lone Army published in a certain newspaper a few days ago, Mr. Xie also mentioned that the officers and soldiers of the Lone Army had already issued a statement yesterday about this matter. What he can say now is that all the accounts of the Lone Army are audited by accountants, and reports are submitted to the relevant parties. All the provisions are provided with the assistance of local people. However, since there is no readily available funds, we often have to cope with raising funds. The soldiers of the Lone Army understand the great righteousness, so although the provisions are sometimes difficult, they get along very well in the same room. Soldiers and officers talk about everything, and they can deeply understand the current situation and the planning of provisions. It is also learned that the issue of provisions for the Lone Army is currently being discussed by all relevant parties to find practical solutions. People from all walks of life are continuing to find ways to care for the loyal and brave soldiers, and it is expected that a solution can be obtained in the short term.</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency said: Since the report on the salary issue of the Lone Army was published the day before yesterday, the Lone Army, fearing that it would cause misunderstandings, has issued an important statement in the name of all the officers and soldiers of the Lone Army, stating that they are fully confident in the integrity and incorruptibility of Regiment Commander Xie. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met Regiment Commander Xie yesterday at his convenience. Mr. Xie narrated the matter in detail, and his ardent emotions for the personality of soldiers and the reputation of the nation were admirable. Mr. Xie also said that the salaries and provisions received by the Lone Army before and after have detailed accounts, which are audited by accountants and sent to the relevant parties. It is also a fact that the provisions for the Lone Army are difficult, and they have been able to cope with the situation with the care and assistance of local people. The soldiers of the entire battalion live in the same room day and night, talking about everything, and they can deeply understand the current situation. He admitted that being stranded on an isolated island and unable to continue serving the country caused them great mental pain. Mr. Xie concluded by saying that he is a soldier, and he will uphold the spirit of the past, hoping to promote the glorious history of the Lone Army and not disappoint the expectations of people across the country.</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Edition</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Service During Wartime (Continued)</h3>
<p>Withdrawal and Collection of Employees in Various Districts</p>
<p>After the withdrawal of the Chinese army from Shanghai, the areas along the transportation lines fell one after another. The employees of the Wu County, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Nanjing, and Anqing bureaus under the administration of the three districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui were successively concentrated in Shanghai, while Hangzhou withdrew to Lishui. At the same time, Mr. Chapelin, the French director of the Shanghai Administration Bureau, was commissioned by the Ministry as the Chief Auditor of the three districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and also managed the affairs of each district.</p>
<p>Withdrawal and Collection of Relocated Employees</p>
<p>As the war shifted westward, the environment in Shanghai became increasingly special, and the pressure exerted on the postal service by the Japanese became increasingly heavy. First, they forced the postal service to move back to its original location. After several negotiations by Mr. Chapelin, it was still ineffective. It was not until March 6, 1938, that the temporary bureau on Yuyuan Road moved back to its original location on North Sichuan Road to continue operations.</p>
<p>Stationing of Japanese Inspectors</p>
<p>In the past, letters from the post office were inspected by personnel sent by the Party Department. The Japanese army also requested this precedent. After the post office moved back to its original location, they stationed 22 Japanese inspectors and began operations. From then on, all important departments such as sealing, distributing, delivering, registering, express delivery, printing, and joint mail had traces of these people. Tens of thousands of pieces of mail were detained every day, with printed matter being the most numerous. Even neutral books and magazines suffered the same fate. Famous Western bookstores in this city, such as Bifa, China-America Book Company, and Dahua Magazine Company, were all spared. Every week, truckloads of detained mail were transported from the post office to Hongkou, often reaching 30 to 40 bags. Recently, under the pretext of preventing the import of military supplies into the interior, parcels along the Jinghu and Huhang lines have also been ravaged.</p>
<p>Increased Use of Japanese Postal Workers</p>
<p>When postal rights were recovered, many personnel from foreign post offices followed and continued to serve in the post office. Therefore, the post office has always had foreign employees. The Shanghai district originally had two Japanese employees, but at this time they were promoted to assistant director and chief inspector, respectively, and one Japanese employee who had already resigned was rehired. At the same time, in June 1938, more than a dozen Japanese translators were recruited, with the reason being "business needs."</p>
<p>Suspension of Stamp Sales</p>
<p>Stamp duty was originally sold by the post office on behalf of the government. After the establishment of the pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau," the Japanese forced the post office to stop selling and instead sell the stamps of the pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau." The post office announced on June 13, 1938, that it would stop selling all tax stamps on behalf of the government.</p>
<p>Opening of Beijing-Shanghai and Japan Airmail Routes The post office since</p>
<h3>Loans Due for Cotton and Wheat: Japanese Arrogant Statement: Disagreement on Repayment: Attempt to Seize Customs Revenue</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference yesterday (16th) that the Japanese side does not agree to the repayment of the 5% due on the 1935 US Cotton and Wheat Loan. The situation regarding loans secured by customs revenue remains unchanged. As for the funds currently deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank that may be used to repay loans secured by customs revenue, the prerequisite is that the Chinese Customs fulfill all the conditions stipulated in the Anglo-Japanese Agreement of May 3, 1938. After the environment changed, the direct airmail routes from Shanghai to the interior were all stopped. Recently, airmail routes from Shanghai to Nanjing and Shanghai to Japan have been added. Although this move has no significance, it can also be seen as an accommodation.</p>
<p>Restoration of Business in War Zones</p>
<p>The most notable work of the post office today is its efforts to restore business in the war zones. Since March 1938, news of the restoration of bureaus has been announced daily, including:</p>
<p>March: Liuhe, Zhenjiang, Lishui, Hushe, Puzhen, Gaochun, Wujin, etc.</p>
<p>April: Nanjing, etc.</p>
<p>May: Wu County, Gaozi, Daqiao, etc.</p>
<p>June: Wuxi, Danyang, Longtan, etc.</p>
<p>July: Jintan, Xinfeng, etc.</p>
<p>Shanghai District: Dachang, Jiading, etc.</p>
<p>August: Bengbu, Hangzhou, Kaifeng, etc.</p>
<p>September: Shanghai District: Nanxiang, Songjiang, Kunshan, etc.</p>
<p>October: Various bureaus in Anhui and Huangdu in Shanghai District.</p>
<p>November: Jiaxing, Jiangyin, etc.</p>
<p>December: Wusong, Baoshan, Fengjing, etc.</p>
<p>Although most of the above places are not under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District, they are currently under the command of the director of the Shanghai Bureau. Since Shanghai is the hub for the restoration of bureaus, we must pay attention to them. As for the branch bureaus in this city, except for the 11 bureaus temporarily suspended, including Nanshi Bund, Guoma Road, Dananmen, Longhua, Gaochang Temple, Zhongshan Road, Lao Beimen, North Sichuan Road, West Huade Road, Wenbei, and Baoding Road, others such as Huajin Road, Ximen, Lannidu, North Station, and Tilanqiao have all been restored. As for Youheng Road Post Office, it has been selecting and dispatching Japanese-speaking postal workers to serve since the outbreak of the war, and it has not stopped to this day.</p>
<p>Business Conditions</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the war, the average daily business of the post office was 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. After the war, it plummeted. Before Guangzhou and Hankou fell, the parcel business developed particularly well, reaching 60,000 to 70,000 yuan per day. Now it is only about 20,000 yuan. Before the war, the postal service's economic income was transferred by the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to the Central Bank. Now it is said that it has been changed to foreign (British and French) banks, and it is fortunate that it has been able to avoid the fate of the Customs. Other things that can be described in detail are:</p>
<p>(A) Changes in Airmail Routes: Direct airmail from Shanghai, except for Nanjing and Japan, has been stopped. The air routes in the southwest provinces have been added by China National Aviation Corporation and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, including:</p>
<p>Yiyu Line - Yichang, Wanxian, Chongqing.</p>
<p>Yurong Line - Chongqing, Chengdu.</p>
<p>Yukun Line - Chongqing, Kunming.</p>
<p>Yujia Line - Chongqing, Luzhou, Xufu, Jiading.</p>
<p>Eurasia Line - via Guilin, Chongqing, Kunming, Chengdu, Hanzhong, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Ningxia, etc.</p>
<p>However, mail from Shanghai to various places must first be sent to Hong Kong, and then transferred to Chongqing by Hong Kong-Chongqing airmail.</p>
<p>(B) Collection of Car Transportation Loss Fees: The post office currently relies on cars on the road to maintain transportation, which is expensive. Therefore, books, printed matter, trade contracts, samples, and other heavy items must be charged a car transportation loss fee, calculated as:</p>
<p>Within the province: 2 jiao per kilogram or odd number.</p>
<p>Each province: 4 jiao per kilogram or odd number.</p>
<p>(Inner) Increase in Draft Fees: Draft fees have also been increased due to water replenishment fees, but it varies from place to place.</p>
<p>Other matters such as the delivery of parcels and printed matter change from time to time due to environmental factors, and this article cannot provide a more fixed report. (End)</p>
<h3>Damaged Banknotes:  Collected and Exchanged As Much As Possible</h3>
<p>The Ministry Orders All Banks To Handle It Properly  In Order To Maintain Monetary Confidence And Facilitate The People's Use</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Exchange Association previously had restrictions on the exchange of damaged banknotes by various banks, which was deeply inconvenient. After requesting the Ministry of Finance to facilitate this, the Ministry of Finance has now sent a telegram in reply stating that damaged banknotes should be collected and exchanged in accordance with the method of collecting and exchanging damaged banknotes in order to maintain monetary confidence and facilitate the people's use. An order has been issued to all banks to handle this seriously. According to the previous situation, the Shanghai Bank of Communications, Jiangsu Bank, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Farmers Bank have been telegraphed to improve the situation in a practical manner and collect and exchange as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Postal Remittance Bureau Reduces Tianjin and Beiping Remittance Fees Again: A Reduction of 3 Cents Per Yuan: Remittance Limit of 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau previously stipulated that from January 1st of this year, for all drafts issued to Tianjin and Beiping, the remittance fee per yuan would be reduced by 7 cents from 20 cents. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency who inquired with the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the bureau has decided to continue to reduce the remittance fees for Beiping and Tianjin by reducing it from 7 cents to 3 cents per yuan in order to reduce remittance fees for all sectors and provide convenience. This provision has already been implemented, but the remittance amount is still limited to 50 yuan. In addition, remittances from Nanjing, Hangzhou, Zhejiang East counties, and Jinan to Tianjin and Beiping will also be handled in the same way as in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The End of the 27th Year: Various Industries Begin Preparations: Money Industry Will Hold a Meeting To Discuss Methods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association has decided that February 18th will be the end of the 27th year of the Republic of China. Various industries are aware that the end of the year is approaching and have already begun preparations. They have been trying to recover outstanding loans and are also transferring funds to ensure a smooth transition. At this time when the end of the year is approaching, the Shanghai financial market is very stable, and national goods factories have shown abnormal development. The Money Industry Association has also scheduled an executive committee meeting on the 25th of this month to discuss preparations before and after the end of the year.</p>

<h3>The General Police Department Cracked a Large-Scale Thief Gang: Si Xian, Yong An, Etc. Were All Robbed: Mingxing Pawnshop Accused of Receiving Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a large-scale dealing organization in this city, with most of the main criminals being Cantonese. They often appear in major companies on Nanjing Road, and the Mingxing Pawnshop at No. 512 Tianjin Road is said to be their main base for selling stolen goods. Because of their superior skills, they have never been discovered. Recently, however, Li Jincheng and Han Shoushan, detectives from the General Police Department, have detected their activities. They</p>
<p>Arrested the Following</p>
<p>Thieves from this organization: Cantonese Wong Hoi-chan, Chan Ah-fook, Tsui Ah-fat, Sung Bing; Hoi-mun native See Lai-sang; Shao-hsing native Tao Ka-nung; and Cantonese Tan Nam, Li Chuen, Fok Yu-lam, Wu Yat-wai, etc., who specialize in receiving stolen goods, for a total of ten people at the Great Eastern New Hotel on Bali Bridge Road in the French Concession and other places. It was discovered that recently, they had stolen from Si Xian, Yong An, Xin Xin, Lihua, and other major companies, as well as Lao Jiuhe Silk and Satin Bureau, Nanyang Socks Factory, etc., no less than</p>
<p>Sixty to Seventy Times</p>
<p>or more. The stolen items are worth approximately several thousand yuan. When Mingxing Pawnshop receives these stolen items, they sometimes do not even issue pawn tickets. When the police officers arrive, they simply explain the situation and immediately hand over the pawned items in their entirety, without the need for the detectives to specify which items should be retrieved. There is no doubt that they are knowingly</p>
<p>Receiving</p>
<p>Stolen goods. In the afternoon of yesterday, Special Court Judge Fung Sai-tak held a hearing on the case. According to the police lawsuit, the two companies that were stolen from the most times were Lihua and Xin Xin, followed by Si Xian and Nanyang. The police lawyer Yu Bo-yi prosecuted Tan Nam, Li Chuen, Fok Yu-lam, and Wu Yat-wai for habitual receipt of stolen goods, while prosecuting them for habitual theft. Chan Ching-wo, an employee of Mingxing Pawnshop, was also</p>
<p>Accused Of</p>
<p>Receiving stolen goods. Representatives Chan Kwai-sang, Wong Sung, and Cheung Kwong-yu from Si Xian, Yong An, and Xin Xin were also brought to the case. The stolen goods retrieved from this case, worth over a thousand yuan, were all brought to the court by the detectives. According to the lawyer representing the pawnshop, Chan Ching-wo has died. Therefore, the prosecution for this part will be corrected by the police. After Judge Fung investigated the lawsuit in detail, he ordered a new hearing to be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Extorting Vegetable Vendors: Reported To The Police And Arrested: Hou Qi And His Accomplices: Re-Trial</h3>
<p>Vegetable vendor Tong On-kat, who lives at No. 19, Lane 81, Hardoon Road, has a smoking habit. At about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Lau Yu-chun, Kam Hoi-chiu, and Lui Chun-pang, three men from Yangzhou, posing as police detectives, broke into Tong's home and demanded 120 yuan, threatening to take Tong into the police station if he did not pay. Tong, in a state of panic, paid 20 yuan first, and agreed to pay the remaining 100 yuan at 8:00 PM that night. Lau and his accomplices then left. However, Tong was not willing to give in and reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched detective Leung Yuk-leung and police officer Leung Chun-shan to wait for them. When Lau Yu-chun came alone at the appointed time, he was arrested by the police. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer Lai Chi-shan prosecuted him for extortion and disturbing the peace under Articles 346 and 158 of the Criminal Code, and requested a new hearing to be scheduled as his accomplices were still at large. After a brief interrogation by Judge Chueng, he ordered the suspect to be detained pending a new hearing.</p>
<h3>Funeral Home Manager: Pelted With Filth</h3>
<p>Hu Chun-wah, a 38-year-old native of Wuxi, the Chinese manager of the British-owned Dazhong Funeral Home on Yanping Road in western Shanghai, lives in the building. Hu also holds a position at the China Credit Bureau. At around 10:20 AM yesterday morning, Hu left the funeral home in his private car, number 1948. As he passed the wooden bridge near Changping Road and Yanping Road, a young man, about 20 years old, suddenly stepped forward and threw a piece of leather paper filled with yellow and white filth at Hu's face, causing Hu's face to be covered with fecal matter, and his whole body was stained. The filth-thrower then left quickly and was not apprehended. Hu immediately returned to the funeral home to clean up the filth and investigate the filth-thrower.</p>
<h3>Robbery In Lafei Fang: One Thief Arrested: Attempt To Escape With Stolen Goods, Maid Chases And Shouts For Help: Police Arrive And Arrest Him Head-On</h3>
<p>At about 6:00 PM yesterday evening, five robbers, dressed in clothing of varying lengths, suddenly arrived at the home of Dr. Yang Choi-chi, a gynecologist specializing in obstetrics, at No. 46 Lafei Fang, Lafei Road in the French Concession. Under the pretext of seeking treatment, they took out guns and threatened the occupants, and arbitrarily searched and robbed the home. They then left through the back door to escape. At the time, one of Dr. Yang's maids, who was very alert, saw the robbers leaving in a hurry and bravely chased after them, shouting for help. At that time, one of the robbers, in desperation, fired a shot to warn the pursuers. The other robbers then fled in different directions. One of the robbers, dressed in black shorts, ran out of the main alley, past the guard's post. Tang, the guard, had already heard the shouts for help and saw a person running frantically. Knowing that the person was not a good person, he also followed and chased him out of the alley. He chased him to the corner of Masnan Road, where a Chinese police officer, who had also heard the alarm, arrived head-on. The police officer drew his gun and ordered the robber to stop. The robber then surrendered and was arrested. At the same time, the French General Police Department received a report and arrived in patrol cars. A large number of Chinese and Western detectives first guarded all the alleys of Lafei Fang, cut off traffic, and conducted a thorough search, but found nothing. Afterwards, the victim, Dr. Yang Choi-chi, went to the police station to report the robbery. The arrested robber was interrogated strictly by the police chief, and then ordered to be detained pending trial in the Second Special Court.</p>
<h3>Mediation Successful In The Miscellaneous Grain Exchange Lawsuit:  After Seven Times Of Persuasion From The Chamber Of Commerce: Both Parties Signed A Settlement Agreement</h3>
<p>Sun Bing-chung, etc., representatives of the employees of the Miscellaneous Grain Oil Cake Exchange, and the Miscellaneous Grain Oil Cake Exchange were involved in a salary dispute. The Second Special District Court sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting mediation. The Chamber of Commerce accepted and appointed members Xu Jiqing, Pei Yunqing, and Xu Xiaochu, and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui and accountant Xu Yongzu to handle the matter together. It is heard that this case has been mediated by the Chamber of Commerce after summoning both parties separately for a total of seven times, and persuading them earnestly again and again. When their opinions were quite close, they invited both parties to conduct a practical mediation, discussed and determined the method of maintaining the minimum living expenses, and signed a settlement agreement. From now on, both parties will fulfill the agreement. The Chamber of Commerce will copy the agreement and send it to the court for filing.</p>
<h3>International Hotel Waiter Dies Tragically in Jump</h3>
<h3>Addicted to Gambling, Excessive Spending Leads to Despair and Suicide</h3>
<p>Mu Sang Guoliang, a twenty-eight-year-old waiter at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road and a native of Yangzhou, had worked at the hotel for four years. He was usually capable in his work and thus deeply valued by the hotel. He was promoted to his current position two years ago. He lived at No. 70, Lane 82, Gordon Road, Avenue Edward VII. His mother worked as a nanny for foreigners and recently returned to Shanghai from abroad with some savings. Guoliang was her only son, so his mother</p>
<p>Excessively Pampered Him</p>
<p>However, Guoliang was addicted to gambling. Since Shanghai fell last year, gambling dens have sprung up everywhere in the western part of Shanghai. Guoliang frequented these places but always lost, spending a large sum of money. Soon, he had his mother go to the bank and withdraw 600 yuan in cash. Unexpectedly, he lost again and falsely claimed that the money was stolen by pickpockets. Although his mother loved him deeply, she was filled with anger and repeatedly warned him, but to no avail. Sang had been married once, but the relationship was cold, and they soon divorced. He recently became engaged again, with the wedding set for the Lunar New Year. Because he was penniless and in urgent need of money, he borrowed 200 yuan in cash from a friend the day before yesterday. After finishing work, he took the money to a Hollywood gambling den, intending to</p>
<p>Make a Last-Ditch Effort</p>
<p>But he lost it all again. He returned to the International Hotel at dawn, and in his remorse, he conceived the idea of suicide. Around six o'clock, he went straight to a window on the fifteenth floor. A colleague was cleaning up and saw that Sang looked depressed. When asked what was wrong, he said he was getting some fresh air. Taking advantage of the colleague's inattention, he immediately jumped from the building and fell onto the road, breaking his right arm and left leg, with blood splattering everywhere. The scene was tragic. A police officer quickly called for an ambulance, which took him to Baolong Hospital, but he died from his critical injuries.</p>
<h3>Cotton Crushes Laborer to Death</h3>

Unexpectedly, many bales of cotton on the upper level suddenly fell, crushing Ji Yuanhong (age twenty-nine), a laborer from Jiangbei. He was severely injured internally. Although his colleagues rescued him on the spot, he was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died.</p>

<h3>Iron Bed Shop Fire Kills Nine People</h3>
<h3>Shop Owner Turns Himself in to the Police</h3>
<h3>Police Charge Him with Negligence, Ordered to Be Detained and Re-examined</h3>
<p>The Yongxinglong Iron Bed Shop at Nos. 334-336 Avenue Edward VII, is owned by Fan Delong from Jiangxi. The downstairs is entirely shop space, while the upstairs, in addition to a part where Fan lives himself, is rented out to others. The shop has fire insurance with Tianyi Insurance Company for 10,000 yuan. On the fourteenth of this month, a shop assistant named Han Baolin (age thirty-nine) from Zhejiang and an apprentice were packing turpentine for painting beds into small cans. Some of the oil inevitably leaked onto the floor. This oil was made of chemical mixtures and was</p>
<p>Extremely Flammable</p>
<p>At that time, after Han finished packing, he took out a cigarette and lit it. At 12:55, after he finished smoking, Han threw the cigarette butt on the ground, which was stained with oil. The fire immediately ignited and spread to the canned turpentine, causing the fire to suddenly expand and become uncontrollable. It immediately burned through the ladder, causing many of the people living upstairs to jump from the windows to escape the disaster. Those who</p>
<p>Failed to Jump</p>
<p>were either burned to death or injured by the fire. After the fire brigade heard the news, they rushed to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire, preventing it from spreading to other houses. Only the entire building of Yongxinglong was destroyed. Afterwards, Chief Detective Cheng Renkun of the General Inspectorate found that Fan Delong's wife, Fan Chen, his concubine, Liang, his sons, Pei Ji, Ming Cai, and Hai, and tenants Chen Mao, Zhang Mingsheng, Zhang Zhenzhen, Han Baolin's son, Han Borong, and maid Zhu Xiufeng</p>
<p>Were All Burned to Death</p>
<p>In addition, Zhang Xu, Jiang Zhou, Cai Kaide, Cai Kaixing, Cai Wenyin, Cai Fengxian, and Cai Ying, seven people, were burned. In addition to the dead being sent to the morgue for examination, the injured were sent to hospitals for treatment. After causing the disaster, Han Baolin was once dazed by the smoke and then became mentally confused, wandering on the road all night. He did not go to his friend Li Ruilin's place at No. 305 Avenue Edward VII until yesterday. After discussion, Han decided to</p>
<p>Turn Himself in</p>
<p>Detectives determined that Han should be held responsible for this incident and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court No. 1 of the Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi charged him with arson of a dwelling occupied by people and negligent manslaughter under Articles 173 and 276 of the Criminal Code. Because further investigation was needed, he requested that the hearing be postponed for two weeks. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, Han was ordered to be detained and the hearing was postponed.</p>
<h3>Smallpox Rampant in Concessions</h3>
<h3>Mortality Rate Increases</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that in the week ending last Saturday (the 14th), eighty-six Chinese and three foreigners died of smallpox in the two concessions. The second highest mortality rate was from tuberculosis. Many died of typhus in the French Concession during the same period, while only one person died in the Public Concession. Also, during the same period, the total number of deaths in the Public Concession was 1,222 Chinese and seventeen foreigners. In the French Concession, the figures were 237 Chinese and eleven foreigners.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Tiantong Road</h3>
<p>At around 5:45 yesterday afternoon, two thugs suddenly broke into the home of a certain family at No. 4 Guiren Lane, Tiantong Road. One of them held a handgun and threatened them to remain silent. They were robbed of 300 yuan in legal tender and fled. The victim reported the incident to the police for investigation.</p>
<h3>Pan Sheng-san's Home Robbed of Large Sum in Broad Daylight</h3>
<h3>Robbed of Over 20,000 Yuan in Cash and Jewelry</h3>
<h3>Western Newspapers Claim Pan is a Pro-Japanese Figure</h3>
<p>Yesterday at about 10:30 AM, seven bandits came to the home of Pan Sheng-san, who used to run an inland river shipping company, at No. 10, Lane 126, Kinnear Road, Jessfield Road. Four of them had handguns. They intimidated and threatened everyone, first confining all the male and female servants in one room, and then stationed one bandit outside to keep watch. The rest swarmed upstairs, ransacking the place and looting at will. They robbed the family of over 20,000 yuan in currency and jewelry estimated to be worth over 7,000 yuan in foreign currency. They took the loot and left with a whistle. Afterwards, the victim filed a loss report with the Jing'an Temple Police Station, requesting that the bandits be arrested and brought to justice.</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News stated that seven Chinese men went to the home of a Mr. Pan at No. 10, Lane 126 Kinnear Road, Jessfield Road this morning (the 17th) and robbed him of 20,000 yuan in cash and 7,000 yuan in jewelry. This was the second major robbery within 36 hours. It is still unknown whether this gang is the same group that robbed a coal shop on Xin Zha Road of 30,000 yuan at midnight on Sunday (the 15th). If so, they have already stolen 57,000 yuan. If not, the police will have to deal with two major gangs. It seems impossible for such a robbery to occur on the streets of the district with police officers patrolling day and night, but the gang actually did it. In addition, the robbery location is at a corner, only a few steps away from the Jessfield Road police station, which is staffed by puppet police and Japanese soldiers. The seven bandits waited this morning for an opportunity to avoid the police patrol before sneaking into the lane. At 10:30 in broad daylight, they told the Pan family that they were delivering gifts to their master and entered the house. Four of the thieves, dressed in Western suits, were all armed with Mauser pistols. The homeowner had no choice but to let them do as they pleased. The Pan family had a lot of jewelry, which was all looted. The homeowner's own possessions were not spared either. Then they forced Mr. Pan to hand over the key to the safe, stole 20,000 yuan in cash from the safe, and fled. After the robbery, Mr. Pan reported it to the police. Detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station began investigating. Many believe that Mr. Pan is a pro-Japanese figure.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Industry Firmly Opposes</h3>
<h3>Cutting Handles and Changing to Wheels</h3>
<h3>Letters to the Chinese Taxpayers Association</h3>
<h3>Another Appeal to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Rickshaw Industry Mutual Aid Association of this city sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession yesterday, asking it to send another letter to the Municipal Council protesting the cutting of handles and changing of wheels. The letter stated that the association had previously sent a letter to the council on December 13 of last year, arguing that the council's decision to cut short the handles of rickshaws was unreasonable and would affect the livelihoods of its members. The letter strongly stated the reasons why the handles should not be shortened, asking that they still be allowed to be used as usual, and that the council should prescribe the style for new cars manufactured in the future, gradually improving them to maintain the livelihood of the coolies. The letter also requested your association's assistance in this matter. More than a month has passed, and the council has not only failed to reply, but in addition to shortening the handles, it has also forced the installation of two-inch wide iron rims, causing the members' vehicles to be unable to obtain licenses to operate in recent days, causing panic. They have flocked to the association, begging for</p>
<p>Ways to Relieve Their Suffering</p>
<p>The association, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, convened an emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors on January 15. They all agreed that the rickshaw industry is made up of poor coolies who cannot afford the high cost of living in the concession. As a result, many live in the outlying areas of Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South City. Therefore, during the</p>
<p>Outbreak of the August 13th Incident</p>
<p>they bore the brunt of the fighting, with numerous deaths. Although Shanghai is more prosperous than before the war, in reality, it is due to the large number of refugees from the interior, resulting in abnormal development. The rickshaw industry relies on commercial transportation for its livelihood, but it has not</p>
<p>Achieved Development</p>
<p>Opportunities. The rickshaw industry was previously dominated by natives of Nantong, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou. After August 13th, new members from Pudong, Suzhou, Chongming, Songjiang, Jiading, and other places were discovered, indicating that the number of members in the industry has increased rather than decreased after the war, and the hardship of life has become increasingly tragic. In recent days, members who have registered with the association and requested that the council be negotiated with have been found to be living in refugee shelters. Therefore, it is obvious that they cannot afford the cost of the</p>
<p>Unreasonable</p>
<p>Improvement of vehicles by cutting short handles and retrofitting iron rims. However, while the association cannot fully agree with the council's style of vehicle improvement, it should do its best to support it in a way that combines law, reason, human feelings, and mechanics, without harming the principles of business operations and livelihoods. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to send a letter to your association, asking it to forward it to the Municipal Council,</p>
<p>Striving for the Cancellation</p>
<p>of the decision to cut short the handles and retrofit iron rims. Before the market recovers after this war, existing rickshaws should still be allowed to operate as usual. If the council believes that rickshaws do need to be transformed, then the council should prescribe the style and gradually improve it when new cars are manufactured in the future, so that the truly obsolete cars will be eliminated invisibly, without affecting the livelihood of the coolies.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog in the City Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in the city was very warm for the past few days. The highest temperature on the Fahrenheit thermometer during the day rose to over fifty degrees, like the weather of early spring. Unexpectedly, after a rain the day before yesterday, heavy fog suddenly appeared yesterday morning. From six to seven o'clock, you could not see your fingers. Trams, buses, and businesses operating on the roads all turned on their electric lights. The northwest wind gradually tightened in the afternoon, and the weather was also colder. Although it did not rain, the sun did not appear all day, and the fog did not dissipate all day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Transport Ship Sinks Two Fishing Boats</h3>
<h3>Two Fishermen Missing</h3>
<p>At 0:30 PM the day before yesterday, a small boat towed five fresh fish boats out of the South Huangpu River. Each boat was full of fresh fish caught from the upper reaches of the various inland rivers in the Pujiang River, intending to be towed to the puppet "Fish Market" in Yangshupu for sale. Unexpectedly, when passing through the blockade line at the 16th pier, a small Japanese transport ship was heading south from the north at that location to supply the Japanese army with food in the South Huangpu River. Because it was traveling too fast, it was unable to turn in time and suddenly collided with the last two fish boats, capsizing them together. The fresh fish carried by the two boats were all dumped into the river, causing losses of about two or three thousand yuan. Two fishermen were also missing.</p>

The wedding hall was set up at the Pudong Native Place Association, and many people from all walks of life went to offer their congratulations. Some five or six hundred people, including prominent businessmen such as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Wei Tingrong, Chen Chuxiang, Xu Yongzuo, Zai Boqi, and Cao Qinghua, created a scene of great splendor. During the banquet, Peking opera and Yue opera performances were interspersed to add to the fun, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until late at night.</p>
<h3>Looking for Boy Sun Baoqi</h3>
<p>Sun Baoqi, the sixteen-year-old son of Sun Xuesheng, a waiter at the Yile Tian Tea House in Xujiahui Town, is a native of Pudong Tangkou. He is now an apprentice at the Xinwanxing Cake Shop on Ximen Road. On the afternoon of December 22 of last year, Baoqi was beaten by the shop owner, became angry, and ran away. There has been no news of him ever since. His family is very anxious. If anyone knows his whereabouts, please notify them immediately so that they can be reunited as a family. It would be a great merit.</p>

<h3>Family Members of Political Figures</h3>
<h3>Abuse Their Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>The wife goes out to play mahjong late at night, instructing her adopted daughter Lian Zhen to wait and open the door, and beats her severely if she is not compliant. The court will hear the case soon.</p>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association received a report from a concerned person on the fourteenth of this month, stating that Mrs. Liang, who lives at No. 60, Lane 363, Gordon Road, was abusing her adopted daughter, and requested prompt assistance. The office sent staff members Liu Wenlin and Xia Shi to investigate at the Liang residence that afternoon. When they arrived, Mrs. Liang had gone out to play mahjong. Her biological daughter and adopted daughter Lian Zhen were both at home. They questioned them in detail. Liang's biological daughter was sixteen years old and studying in junior high school at a certain school. From her tone, she expressed great dissatisfaction with the adopted daughter. She said that my mother</p>
<p>Goes out to play mahjong</p>
<p>and doesn't come home until eleven o'clock. She told Lian Zhen to wait and open the door, but she is naturally lazy and falls asleep before Mom comes back. People like that deserve to be beaten. During the conversation, the biological daughter's face revealed a fierce and arrogant demeanor. Then they questioned the adopted daughter, Lian Zhen, and learned that she was eleven years old. They asked why she was beaten by her mother. At first, she was unwilling to speak, but after repeated persuasion, Lian Zhen burst into tears and said that she left her home in Nanjing in May of last year. A person she didn't know very well took her to Mrs. Liang's home to be an adopted daughter. My</p>
<p>Real Father's Surname is Zhang</p>
<p>My mother has also studied. At my own home, I have an older sister and four younger sisters. My father isn't just annoyed because there are too many girls. He sold me to Mrs. Liang as a servant. I didn't know that here. I have to do everything by myself. If I accidentally do something wrong, my older sister will twist me down, cover my mouth with a towel, and then my mother will punch me with her fists or pinch me with her fingers.</p>
<p>The Scars on My Body</p>
<p>Always heal on this side, and then a new one is added on the other side. I still have a scar on my thigh now. Just now, when you two gentlemen came, I was downstairs boiling water to wash my older sister's feet. Now my mother likes to play mahjong, and sometimes she wants to play jai alai. I have to guard the door for her all the time, and I can't sleep. Lian Zhen, as she recounted this, exposed her right thigh, and there was indeed a large scar on the inside of it,</p>
<p>Showing a Purplish-Black Color</p>
<p>The staff members sent by the Children's Welfare Association, seeing this situation, believed that there was factual proof of Mrs. Liang's abuse of her adopted daughter, and that her biological daughter was also involved in the abuse. Why would fellow Chinese people on this isolated island harm their own people in this way? In addition, Mrs. Liang's husband is currently working in Chongqing. When the family brought Lian Zhen here in May of last year, was it really an adoption or the purchase of a girl</p>
<p>As a Servant?</p>
<p>Since the name is one thing and the reality is another, it is natural to request that the police and judicial authorities conduct a thorough investigation. The staff members immediately reported the case to the Gordon Road Police Station, and Chief Detective Zhu rescued the adopted daughter Lian Zhen and temporarily sent her to the Jiliang Institute, awaiting the Special District Court's interrogation of the criminal. The trial is scheduled to begin soon. At the same time, according to staff member Liu Wenlin, he deeply regretted Mrs. Liang's abuse of her adopted daughter. According to the orders on respecting children's welfare and prohibiting slavery and raising servants, the government had issued them long ago. We sincerely hope that</p>
<p>Family Members of Officials</p>
<p>will take the lead and earnestly comply with the orders issued by the government. The Special District Court will hear this case soon. We hope that those who abuse adopted daughters will be taught a lesson, and that the future happiness of the girl Lian Zhen will be effectively protected.</p>
<h3>Colds and Coughs are Prevalent</h3>
<h3>A Gift of Rapidly Changing Weather</h3>
<h3>"Weiling" Effective Medicine Shows Rapid Effect</h3>
<p>Colds and coughs are a very common ailment among Chinese people, and they are most common during periods of rapidly changing weather. Because there is usually no danger of life in the short term, everyone regards it as a trivial illness and allows it to heal on its own. In fact, a single spark can start a prairie fire. Various acute infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, often start from extremely ordinary colds and coughs. Tuberculosis is definitely initiated by a cough, and the danger is unimaginable. Even if it develops into chronic bronchitis, turning into old age cough, asthma, and excessive phlegm, the suffering is unspeakable. Therefore, Europeans and Americans regard colds and coughs as venomous snakes and beasts. Once they start, they are immediately diagnosed and treated to ensure a speedy recovery. Among the common medicines, White Pine Cough Syrup is a natural remedy for coughs. White pine is abundant in northern Europe, and Europeans with lung diseases often sit and lie in white pine forests, inhaling its aromatic air, which has a miraculous effect. So it is made into syrup and exported to foreign countries to benefit those who are equally afflicted. However, pure white pine syrup is not very effective. Weiling Drug Store has specially formulated a compound white pine syrup according to the constitution of Chinese people, with the functions of reducing acid, relieving cough, suppressing spasm, and relieving asthma. It is fragrant and palatable, and suitable for both the old and the young. Its effectiveness is more than doubled compared to pure white pine syrup. Those who suffer from colds and coughs should not hesitate. Quickly purchase Weiling Compound White Pine Syrup. The price is one yuan per bottle, a special price of 75 cents. It is sold at the Weiling Drug Store at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Second Ma Road. The telephone number is 92525. Purchases are not delivered.</p>
<h3>Two Dancers Take Poison</h3>
<h3>Wang Aina's Life is in Danger</h3>
<h3>Li Mingfei is Likely to Be Safe</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at about ten o'clock, two dancers from the Daxin Dance Hall came to the Continental Hotel at No. 69 Yu Qiaqing Road to rent a room. They were registered in Room 202 on the second floor. The names on the registration book were Wang Aina, twenty years old, and Li Mingfei, eighteen years old, both local women. After ordering tea from the waiter, they immediately closed the door. At about three o'clock in the afternoon, groaning sounds were heard from the room, reaching outside. The on-duty waiter tried to open the door and saw the two dancers lying across the bed in short clothes and small pants, with disheveled hair and bare feet, staring blankly. He knew that they had taken poison. He reported the situation to the accounting room, which reported it to the Old Gate Police Station. Detectives rushed to the scene and called an ambulance to take them to Renji Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, it was learned that Wang Aina lived at No. 16 Ma'an Lane, Marius Road. She had taken too much poison, and her life was in danger. Li Mingfei's condition gradually improved after being injected and given a stomach wash by the doctor. She refused to reveal her address. The police are currently investigating why the two dancers tried to commit suicide.</p>

<h3>Year-End Approaches, Flower Market Begins Activities, Flower Nurseries are Barren and Supply Decreases</h3>
<p>The city is noisy, coal fumes are suffocating. Shanghai has become an isolated island. The desire for ancient trees, clear streams, and simple thatched cottages is unattainable. In summer, there are a few parks to alleviate worries, but in the harsh winter, citizens, besides gathering around the stove, only have fresh flowers in vases as decorations for bedrooms and studies. Therefore, as the year-end approaches, the flower market in this city is extraordinarily prosperous. Florists rely on their earnings from this period for their sustenance throughout the year. Before the war, Shanghai had about 200 flower sheds and nurseries. After the war, flower sheds were destroyed, and with no one to care for the nurseries, they were also in decline. Currently, there are only about 20 flower shops operating as usual in the concessions. According to those involved in the trade, the fresh flower industry is roughly divided into three types: (1) flower shops with nurseries, (2) flower shops without nurseries, and (3) nurseries without flower shops. Most of the 20 or so flower shops in the concession area have their own nurseries. There are still many nurseries without shops scattered in the suburbs, but they have sharply decreased compared to pre-war levels, almost halved. The flower shop business declined sharply in the year after the Shanghai war, but then revived. However, only fresh flowers are available; saplings of woody flowers are virtually nonexistent because the production areas have been cut off, and there is nothing to sell. Now, with the Lunar New Year approaching, the flower market has started to become active. Narcissus and plum blossoms are the most popular flowers. This year, due to increased transportation costs and a double decrease in supply, flower prices will have to rise by 30%. Most flowers entering the concessions now come from Caohejing, whereas previously they came from the Pudong area. The nurseries that used to supply Shanghai from Suzhou and Wuxi have been abandoned and will not be able to recover for a year or two, so the amount transported to Shanghai will decrease.</p>
<h3>Case of the Robbery of a Huge Sum from Yitaixing Coal Depot - Strict Orders to All Police Stations to Apprehend - Total Amount Robbed Reaches 51,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Yitaixing Coal Depot at No. 184 Xinzha Road was invaded by five armed robbers at 11:10 PM on the 15th of this month. They forced the accountant to hand over the key to the silver chest and robbed the tens of thousands of yuan in cash inside. This was reported in this newspaper. After a detailed investigation by the depot, it was found that the amount of cash stolen reached a huge sum of 51,000 yuan. The matter was immediately reported to the police station for record. The Xinzha Police Station in charge of the area has now issued a strict order to all Chinese and foreign detectives and requested all police stations to pay close attention to the apprehension of all the criminals involved in the case, so that they can be detained and brought to justice for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Truck Accidentally Kills Jiang Pan - Family Demands Compensation - Orphaned Child, Four Years Old, Circumstances Pitiful - Court Hearing Concluded, Verdict Scheduled to be Announced</h3>
<p>Jiang Pan, a local young woman residing at No. 4 Renji Lane, Xujiahui Town, was 25 years old. On April 25th of last year, at around 9 AM, she went out to buy vegetables and was walking from north to south in front of Xintai Coal Store at No. 2064 Haige Road. Suddenly, a cotton truck owned by Wu Hengji at No. 9 Youyi Lane, Xinxin Bridge, driven by Wang Rongsheng, came speeding from behind due to</p>
<p>Incorrect Route</p>
<p>and ran over Jiang Pan's left foot, knocking her to the ground. She was taken to Guangci Hospital by ambulance, but died despite treatment. Wang Ren, a prosecutor from the Second Special Court, confirmed that Jiang Pan died from the accident. The injury and criminal aspects have already been judged separately. Now, Jiang Junlian, the family representative and legal guardian of the deceased, Jiang Pan, acting on behalf of Jiang Mojuan, has hired lawyer Shen Yide to file a lawsuit in the civil division of the Second Special Court, accusing the driver Wang Rongsheng of negligence, resulting in death.</p>
<p>Request for Compensation</p>
<p>The case was heard by Judge Li Liang at 10 AM yesterday. The defendant was absent. Lawyer Shen Yide, representing the plaintiff, stated that the deceased, Jiang Pan, was the wife of Jiang Keji and the eldest daughter-in-law of the plaintiff, Jiang Junlian. She came from a respectable family, was literate, and usually supported herself by making lace gloves. Unfortunately, Keji also died less than a month later, leaving behind a granddaughter, Mojuan, who is only four years old and has no one to care for her.</p>
<p>Pitiful Situation</p>

<h3>Bonds - Unprecedented Downturn in the London Translated Bond Market - Customs-Guaranteed Foreign Debt Drops by 5 Pounds</h3>
<p>Other Foreign Debts Fall by 4 Pounds to 1.5 Pounds - Domestic Debt Still Wavering, Market Remains Small</p>
<p>The London Chinese foreign debt market on Monday, the 16th of this month, was hit hard when the Ministry of Finance's announcement that it would no longer allow the government to provide overdrafts for customs tax-guaranteed debts if the due funds were insufficient reached London. All bonds guaranteed by customs taxes and the Boxer Indemnity, as well as Anglo-German loans and Daqing Railway bonds, fell sharply by 5 pounds each, while others also fell by 1.5 to 4 pounds. Prices fell to old levels, and the market came to a standstill. Specifically, Anglo-German continued loans and Anglo-French bonds each fell by 5 pounds. The current price of Anglo-German continued loans and Anglo-French bonds is 71 pounds. Sino-French US dollar bonds, excluding interest, have a new price of 68.5 pounds (a fall of 7.5 pounds compared to the previous weekend; subtracting the 2.5 pounds of interest, the actual fall is 5 pounds). Anglo-French loan Anglo-French bonds are priced at 50 pounds. Post-reorganization bonds Anglo-French bonds are priced at 47 pounds. Daqing Railway bonds are priced at 21 pounds. The price of Beijing-Shanghai Railway bonds fell by 4 pounds to 20 pounds. Both the original and continued issues of Tianjin-Pukou Railway bonds fell by 3.5 pounds to 12.5 pounds. Crisp bonds and three other types each fell by 3 pounds. The price of Crisp bonds is 32 pounds. The price of non-German-issued Hubei-Guangdong Railway bonds is 20 pounds. Longhai Railway bonds are priced at 11 pounds. The price of the Fick Flight Aircraft Bonds and the German-issued Hubei-Guangdong Railway bonds each fell by 2 pounds. The former is priced at 11 pounds, and the latter at 18 pounds. The price of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds fell by 1.5 pounds to 17 pounds. The supply of physical goods in London is still lacking. However, there are still inquiries about the British gold post-reorganization bonds, with 5,000 pounds of Russian-issued unprinted bonds being purchased at a price of 36 pounds, and 1,000 pounds of French-issued printed bonds being purchased at a price of 42 pounds, and another 2,500 pounds being purchased at a price of 42.5 pounds, a drop of 6 to 5.5 pounds compared to the previous weekend. As for Anglo-German continued loan bonds, there is also an appetite for 5,000 pounds at a price of 70.5 pounds, a discount of half a pound to the market price. However, although there are buyers, due to the excessive drop in market prices, it is not certain that they will be able to purchase as desired.</p>
<p>The informal securities market initially showed a change for the better yesterday due to news of remitting payments. However, rumors of deductions for remittance fees caused the bond market, which was starting to recover, to be hit again. According to reports yesterday, although Shanghai can collect on behalf, remittance fees from Sichuan to Shanghai need to be deducted, or payments will be made in installments over six months. In the Ministry of Finance's announcement, it was further stated that the principal and interest of the unified bonds due at the end of this month have already been drawn and overdrawn by the Central Bank for the amount of 17.5 million yuan, so payment will be approved. Rumors are rife, and no one can agree. Before the official announcement, fluctuations are inevitable. To sum up the above statements, there are two points: one is that in addition to income tax, there will be an additional loss of 15% on the principal and interest due this time; the other is that after the principal and interest due this time are paid off, there is an implication regarding the seventh interest payment in the current announcements, which has aroused great suspicion among the general public. As a result, the expected price increase yesterday was thwarted again. However, since remittances are being made, remittance fees should not be deducted. If remittance fees are deducted, then legal tender should be paid. Neither of these two statements makes sense. The installment payment method is too troublesome for the banks, and the government is unlikely to adopt this method. If legal tender is paid, it would conflict with the independent suspension of foreign debts. Therefore, these rumors are unlikely to materialize. In short, the problem with the principal and interest of public debt is already an undeniable fact; the only question is the size of the loss to the bondholders. When the market first opened in the morning, major players such as Gu and No. 11 bravely absorbed bonds, with prices improving by 1 to 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Just as things were looking good, most retail investors, Xieda, and No. 35 continued to sell, and the market felt an oversupply, causing prices to gradually decline. The smaller the market price, the stronger the selling trend. In the morning, only A and E bonds improved slightly by 0.05 to 0.03 yuan, while the rest fell by 0.05 to 0.2 yuan. The situation became even more chaotic in the afternoon. Xieda and No. 35 continued to sell, mostly day traders exiting positions. No. 20 exclusively sold A bonds. The panic in the market did not diminish. On the buying side, only Hengde had a larger appetite, while the rest were not eager. The situation was extremely chaotic, showing the uncertainty of the people. However, the general consensus is that the government will do its best to maintain domestic debt. The sellers who are creating trouble themselves will inevitably be ridiculed for being foolish. The market will not stabilize until the official measures are announced in detail. As a result, market prices continued to fall by 0.25 to 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 1.3 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading remained sluggish. Only a small number of shares of the Bank of China were traded at a price of 57 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance - Hong Kong Turns from Selling to Buying - Exchange Market Experiences Turmoil</h3>
<p>US Dollar Once Reaches 16 Yuan - Sassoon's Sales Cause Slight Relaxation</p>
<p>The exchange market yesterday experienced fierce turmoil due to news that Hong Kong had stopped selling and started buying, as well as strong absorption by Chinese merchants such as yarn and cotton groups and continued settlement by foreign firms. The underlying trend continued to be tight. British gold became extremely tight at 8 1/8 2.1875, the US dollar almost broke the 16 yuan mark, and the Hong Kong dollar also reached 55.25 yuan. It finally relaxed slightly after Sassoon started selling. Transaction volume remained strong throughout the day.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, long-distance and short-distance rates in London were declining, the New York spot rate was unchanged, and London bullion was also declining by 1/8. The exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar was 0.06, against the French franc it was down 0.12, and against Shanghai it was unchanged. The US dollar fell 0.01875 against the British pound, 0.0625 against the French franc, and 0.07 against Shanghai. The central government's listed rates remained unchanged. At the early opening, the selling price of the spot market was 8 1/8 3.328125 for the British pound and 16.21875 yuan for the US dollar, tightening by 0.015625 for the British pound and 0.03125 for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams indicated that selling had stopped and buying had started, and foreign firms also started buying to settle accounts, causing the underlying trend to tighten. The US dollar immediately weakened to 16.21875 yuan, while the British gold only settled at 8 1/8 3.3125. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed prices remained unchanged, and the published silver equalization tax was down 0.075. Afterwards, Chinese merchants, such as yarn and cotton groups, competed fiercely to absorb currency, while banks' supply intentions remained sluggish, but their appetite for buying was stronger. As a result, the process became increasingly weak, with British gold weakening to 8 1/8 2.1875 and Chinese banks doing internal trades at 16.125 yuan. The US dollar weakened to only 16 yuan when Datong sold to yarn and cotton groups. Near noon, Sassoon suddenly started selling, and the banks' absorption capacity was not strong, so the situation turned slightly looser. Sassoon sold at a favorable February price of 15.875 yuan. At noon, spot British gold appeared at 8 1/8 2.28125, and the US dollar at 16.125 yuan. At the afternoon close, the continuation was looser, with British gold settling at 8 1/8 2.28125 and the US dollar at 16.15625. The Hong Kong dollar rate was also volatile, with foreign merchants and banks absorbing vigorously, tightening the underlying trend from 55.75 yuan straight to 5 yuan. Later, the currency exchange industry gradually hardened to 5.5 yuan.</p>
<p>In the after-market, foreign firms settled accounts again, so the underlying trend tightened again. It ultimately stabilized as Sassoon started selling again and the banks' appetite for buying was not smooth. A certain British bank was willing to sell at 8 1/8 2.296875, while the US dollar had to be sold at 16.1875. The Hong Kong dollar gradually went from tight to loose, falling to 55.625 yuan. By the late close, the banks' selling prices were 8 1/8 2.296875 for the British pound and 16.15625 yuan for the US dollar. As a result, the British pound weakened by 0.046875 and the US dollar tightened by 0.09375 compared to the previous close. The Hong Kong dollar rate tightened by 0.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>"Crossed" Checks Also Added to Clearing - Effective from January 16</h3>
<p>Originally, check clearing was limited to remittance checks. However, starting from January 16 of this year, all "crossed" checks will also be included in the clearing. They will first be deposited into the money industry's reserve, and a receipt will be issued before the accounts are reconciled.</p>
<h3>The Hong Kong Syndicate and Wealthy Households' Desire to Buy Resurges, Spot Prices Climb Again, Reaching $2027 Yesterday, Resulting in Another $10 Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold bar market saw an initial rise, but fluctuations were frequent. Generally, prices moved from rise to fall and then rose again, entirely dependent on the buying and selling momentum. Initially, the market continued the previous day's upward trend. News spread that foreign exchange was tightening due to aggressive buying by Hong Kong, foreign firms, and speculators. Furthermore, the Hong Kong syndicate, which had been inactive for some time, also engaged in large-scale buying, causing the opening price to reach beyond the $2020 mark. Later, as foreign exchange stopped tightening and began to ease, the buying momentum temporarily subsided. However, as gold shops and securities firms rushed to sell, prices declined slightly. Eventually, due to the resurgence of the Hong Kong syndicate's desire to buy, prices rose again, closing at the day's highest point. While there was considerable maneuvering during the day, no excessively large fluctuations occurred. Confidence among all parties remained firm. Trading was brisk in the morning but turned quiet in the afternoon. Gold jewelry shops also marked up by one dollar in the evening. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to decline slightly.</p>
<p>Gold Bars Close at Peak</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened firm and strong, continuing the previous day's momentum. Foreign exchange also gradually softened, and the Hong Kong syndicate's buying interest was very strong. It was reported that buyers initially bid $2030, while sellers asked for $2035. Subsequently, a certain cash firm suddenly began selling heavily, while buyers hesitated. As a result, prices were lowered by about ten dollars before a cash firm sold fifty taels to a money exchange business for $2022, the opening price. Following this, a money exchange business bought another fifty taels from a cash firm for $2024, then fifty taels from a jewelry shop syndicate for $2025, and fifty taels from a gold shop for $2024 (reportedly, all these purchases were on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate). Later, gold shops began selling again, and securities firms also showed interest in selling, causing a slight drop in prices. A gold shop sold fifty taels to a money exchange business for $2023, and a securities firm sold fifty taels to a money exchange business for $2022. In between, a certain jewelry shop suddenly absorbed supply on behalf of wealthy local households, causing prices to rise by several dollars. A jewelry shop bought fifty taels from a fellow shop for $2025, and fifty taels from a money exchange business for $2024. After this, foreign exchange stopped tightening and began to ease, causing a further decline. Prices were lowered to around $20, but it was still difficult to find buyers. At this point, the Hong Kong syndicate suddenly instructed a certain money exchange business to aggressively buy at the low prices, causing prices to rise again. A gold shop bought 100 taels for $2021, a jewelry shop bought fifty taels from a money exchange business for $2024, a money exchange business bought fifty taels from a jewelry shop syndicate for $2025, and then fifty taels from a gold shop for $2027. Finally, a money exchange business bought fifty taels from a gold shop for $2025, the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, as foreign exchange was very stable, both price fluctuations and trading volume decreased. At 2:45 PM, a money exchange business bought fifty taels from a gold shop for $2025, and then another fifty taels from a fellow shop at the same price. After this, supply and demand became even scarcer. It wasn't until after 4:00 PM that a money exchange business bought fifty taels from a jewelry shop syndicate for $2027, the closing price for the evening session, which was ten dollars higher than the previous day's closing price (a cumulative increase of thirty-two dollars over three consecutive days). The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was $2035, and the buying price was $2020. The current bid gold was listed at about fifty dollars lower than the listed gold, but no transactions took place.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Marked Up by One Dollar in the Evening</p>
<p>The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael did not change initially. However, at 4:15 PM, due to the firm stability of gold bars, the price was marked up by one dollar. Da Tong Hang, Lao Qing Yun, and others revised their selling prices to $206, while new firms set their prices at $204, and the buying price was $198.</p>
<p>English Pure Gold Further Reduced by One Penny</p>
<p>London, 16th: English pure gold continued to decrease by one penny, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, eight and a half pennies, causing the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold (gold bars) to also decrease to $1214. The listed customs gold also fell by two points, calculated as two dollars, three dimes, nine cents, nine mills. The Shanghai standard bid gold price also decreased by six jiao, calculated as one thousand two hundred and nine dollars, three dimes.</p>
<h3>There Is No Shortage of Foreign Currency Collecting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, English pure gold continued to fall by one penny, and the exchange rate between English and American currency continued to rise by 0.1875. Due to nervous sentiment, foreign exchange opened weakly. Later, as the supply from foreign telegrams was smooth, even though demand was urgent, supply still exceeded demand, and market prices eased, but were still tighter than the previous evening. Gold bars opened at a high point, and although jewelry shops and gold shops took advantage of the high prices to sell, the absorption by wealthy households was very strong, and the Cantonese syndicate searched relentlessly, so market prices remained high throughout and there was no possibility of a fallback. Because the supply of chips was exhausted, it was difficult to resist the search of wealthy households, so the price was raised very high, and the trend was firm. Unless major players emerge, it is difficult for market prices to fall back. Because foreign exchange was weak and gold bars rose sharply, foreign currency prices were very strong, and retail investors who absorbed English, American, and gold pound tickets to collect were very active. Trading in Japanese gold tickets was also particularly strong, and the upward trend was sharp. Association transactions were rare, only Chen Tai sold fifty pounds of English gold tickets to Chang Tai Jin, Chang Tai sold twenty pounds of English gold tickets to Zhen Xing Jin, and Chen Tai sold thirty pounds of English gold tickets to Zhen Xing Jin. Yesterday's market price was up four jiao for English gold pounds, up one jiao two fen for English gold tickets, up jiao jiao for American gold pounds, up two fen five li for American gold tickets, up one fen three li for Hong Kong tickets, up half a li for French franc tickets, up one fen for Singapore tickets, up two fen for Dutch tickets, up five fen for Canadian tickets, up two fen for Philippine tickets, up four fen for ruble tickets, up five jiao for Australian gold tickets, only German gold tickets, Italian tickets, Annam tickets, and Siamese tickets did not change.</p>
<h3>Price of English-Indian Silver Falls Back</h3>
<p>London, 16th: Speculators once emerged, lacked maintenance, market conditions were still flat, and after the close, there was flatness with sluggishness. Sellers were willing to go six and a quarter points below the list price, but buyers had no appetite. The near and far term prices for large bars of silver both fell back one and a quarter points. New York silver telegraph: The price of American silver is still active without a market. Also, Bombay silver telegraph: The market conditions for Indian silver are calm, spot prices fell back three annas, and near and far term prices also fell back one anna.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Gradually Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange-drawn notes gradually stabilized, fluctuating between thirty-six and thirty-seven dollars per thousand yuan throughout the day, and finally thirty-six and a half dollars, which was slightly higher by two jiao five fen than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes. Soybean Oil Prices Are High. Only Fifty Barrels Are Traded. Futures Speculators Are Selling Back</h3>
<p>Dalian spot soybean oil: Yesterday's market continued the previous day's soaring trend, rising another half a jiao, with the price at twenty-eight yuan four jiao and a half. However, only fifty barrels were traded, causing futures speculators to also sell back. A total of 120 barrels were traded for delivery at the end of January, with the price at twenty-seven yuan nine jiao and a half. Fifty barrels were traded for delivery on January 20, with the price at twenty-eight yuan one jiao. One hundred barrels were traded for loading on ships in the second half of February, with the price at twenty-seven yuan seven jiao and a half. Other Yantai Qishan oil still held at the original price of twenty-one yuan, with 150 pieces traded. Dalian Qishan oil was 50 pieces, with the price at twenty-six yuan, which was three jiao higher than the market the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 300 pieces of raw oil came from Yantai.</p>
<h3>Scattered Soybean Cake Transactions. Still Not Deserted. Both Incoming and Outgoing Cake Beans</h3>
<p>Soybean cake has recently seen scattered transactions in Wentai, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and other places, which are quite lively, so market prices have frequently risen. Yesterday, the Dayou Yu Factory's Four-Brand Cake opened at three yuan, one jiao, one fen. The Changzhou Xie Feng Factory's Four-Brand Yuan Long Cake also opened at three yuan, one jiao, one fen. The Dayou Five-Brand Cake was further built up by one fen, to two yuan, eight jiao, nine fen. In total, 3,000 pieces of various cakes were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,160 pieces of small soybean cake, 490 pieces of large soybean cake, and 150 bags of soybeans were shipped from Che Ning.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, for export, 170 tons of soybeans were shipped to Bombay and 30 tons were shipped to Columbus.</p>
<p>Also, today, 900 pieces of soybean cake and 300 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Xiamen, and 1,500 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk Market: Overseas Silk Markets Are All Soaring</h3>
<p>One Theory is That the Number of Silkworms Raised in Japan Has Decreased. The Local Silk Market Has Also Become Very Active.</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets all soared. The New York Exchange recently opened at $1.855, a huge increase of four and a half points. The long-term price was $1.79, an increase of one and a half points. New York Japanese silk was 83.75 points, each soaring four points. Shanghai silk 78 points also rose three points, Guangdong silk rose four points, Lyon Japanese silk rose 2.50 French francs, Shanghai silk AB grade each rose from one French franc to 1.50 French francs, while Guangdong silk rose two French francs. The reason, it is said, is that the amount of silkworms raised in Japan this year may be affected by the war and decrease. However, this statement has not been confirmed by reliable sources. The local silk market was greatly stimulated yesterday. The price of white factory 78 points held above $1350, and because the February futures had already been sold out, no sales were heard. The French exchange was very enthusiastic yesterday. White factory B-character uneven silk sold for $1310-$1320, a sharp increase of about 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The fine grade of the Golden Leopard grade has approached the $1500 mark. Ji Xinfu, Cheng Chang, Kaili, and others competed to buy 80 dan in total. After being quiet for a long time, Ji Li Jing was very active yesterday due to the soaring prices of white factories, such as Qilin, Racing Horse, Jin Yang, Spring Water, and other cave numbers, selling for $810 (it had recently fallen to $780), an increase of 30 yuan compared to the beginning of the month. By the afternoon, the asking price for Ji Li Jing had risen to $830. Therefore, yesterday's silk market was said to be very hot. Yesterday, 554 pieces of Huzhou silk were shipped to France, and 100 tons of tea were shipped to Europe.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Are Less Than 300 Bales. It Is Also Difficult to Raise the Price of Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially opened up and then returned, and the resulting upward trend rose and fell inconsistently. It is difficult to break out of the consolidation situation. The reason is that in recent days, the securities market has been turbulent, causing general speculators to be distracted and uncertain. However, speculators are still active and market prices are rising. At the same time, certain colleagues, in view of the chaotic domestic cotton production areas, considered it difficult to see a loosening of prices, and factories earned meager profits. The idea of buying on the rise arose spontaneously, and they suddenly came and received when the price was low, so the market price fluctuated, rising and falling from time to time. Because the price was too high, customer sales were quiet and actual needs were scarce. Also, because the end of the year is approaching, there is usually a closing period in commercial practice, so although speculators are very thoughtful, actual digestion has never started. Therefore, the market price has not been very solid, and the peak returns as soon as it is seen. In the end, it is difficult to be firm without Bao Qing coming to support it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening was based on the same interest payment for public bonds, and people's hearts were shaken. Colleagues and speculators were very active. It was also said that those with abundant financial resources sold public bonds and put them into cotton yarn. The buying interest was strong. The opening price of 20s Double Horse jumped four and a half yuan to 386 yuan. A colleague traded 25 bales, and before long, the Shantou gang came to buy 30 bales, adding another one and a half yuan, to 387 yuan and a half. The market situation was still hard. Although mutual transactions among colleagues could still be supported, customer sales were not healthy. Apart from the Shantou gang buying 200 bales, there were very few other purchases, and the Yunnan gang had no development atmosphere. Market prices turned from high to low, step by step. Finally, the 20s Double Horse yarn was 383 yuan, a decline of four and a half yuan from the high price. It was found that the turnover of 615 bales in the morning was more than half traded by colleagues. As a result, the market price of 20s Double Horse yarn rose by one and a half yuan compared with the previous day, Tiannv rose by one and a half yuan, Te Jin Cheng rose by one yuan, and Double Earth rose by one and a half yuan. Ten-count coarse yarn was also tight. The factory, Yong An Factory, opened 15 bales of 20s Te Jin Cheng, with the price at 390 yuan. Today, forty pieces of yarn were sent to Xiamen, and twenty pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 1,050 pieces of cloth and cotton yarn were shipped from Tianjin, and various gangs bought them.</p>
<p>The sales of Japanese yarn were narrow and people's hearts were calm. 20s Shui Yue yarn was 308 yuan and a half, this month was 306 yuan and a half to seven yuan, and 20s Lan Feng yarn was 306 yuan, this month was 304 yuan seven jiao and a half to 03 yuan seven jiao and a half.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Transactions Are Quiet. White-Wrapped Cotton Is Still Lively</h3>
<p>The local cotton business is relatively smooth, but white-wrapped cotton is still hot. Selling prices are still not very different from the previous day, and there is no glory or disgrace to be divided. The situation is increasingly deadlocked. Yong An Factory bought 500 bales of Yao cotton. There was no other major buying appetite. Yu Feng Factory also bought 400 pieces of packed cotton. This cotton is used to mix with Indian cotton for spinning because of its color and luster. As for the source of fine Tianjin velvet cotton, it is solid and lacking.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: American cotton, because Washington has not yet resolved the issue of selling loan cotton, speculators are hesitant and the banking community is temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude. Domestic yarn factories are still keen on importing raw cotton due to the brisk sales of cloth, and they have been actively purchasing spot goods in the market for several days. Yesterday, in New York, the New Orleans gang sold long-term contracts, causing the market price to fall by four or five pounds of sound. Long-term contracts fell sharply by thirteen or fourteen pounds of sound. India, together with forecasts, fell by one and a half robies. Egypt fell by more than 20 pounds of sound. Yesterday, the exchange rate was affected by public bonds and could not be extended. Converted into legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by two jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by one jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than one yuan.</p>
<p>The local foreign cotton trade was very quiet. In terms of Chinese factories, in addition to Hong Zhang purchasing 300 bales of Indian cotton and 200 bales of Brazilian cotton, New China also purchased 300 bales of Indian cotton. De Feng also traded 200 bales of Brazilian cotton. The combined price for delivery to the factory was 87 yuan. Japanese factories are still the main buyers. The transaction amount and cotton prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Yesterday, all factories did not adopt the appetite for the number of transactions. Chinese and Japanese factories purchased American and Indian cotton with the Japanese. Therefore, the local cotton position has been completely encroached upon. Therefore, the daily turnover is only a white-like flower embellishment. Although the number of packages is not bad, the carrying fee is very low. However, the purchase by colleagues is still lively every day. It is said that most of them are transferred to a certain factory, and they are mixed and over-reported in the business of colleagues. There is also news that Yao flowers continue to arrive in Shanghai. The amount of arrival is increasing day by day. When they arrive at the factory, the source along the Su North Road is not bad. It is estimated that 2,516 bales of coarse and fine velvet arrived in Tongzhou, and 390 were made in Funing. The transaction volume and price are listed on the left.</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton converted is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Grain: A Foreign Wheat Ship Will Be Imported Today. The Amount is 8,600 Tons. The Spot Flour Market Has No Change</h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour market has no change. The sales of this customer are not unique, but scattered embellishments are still not deserted. The Jin Gang and Qinhuangdao and other places shipped 120,000 packages per day. Each ship position for the Nanyang Fu Gang gang also shipped about 10,000 packages. Therefore, the daily turnover is no less than 230,000 packages. The current market of the Second Flour Factory is stable for a long time and is still at 4 yuan and 9 jiao. The market is in a state of brewing.</p>
<p>Today, 2,600 packages of flour will be shipped to Tianjin, 1,000 packages will be shipped to Weihaiwei, and 8,100 packages will be shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of wheat, including wheeled vehicles, was no less than 4,000 packages. Each factory's import appetite has been sharply reduced. The market is not unique. It is heard that a foreign wheat ship previously ordered by a certain factory has been loaded and transported to Shanghai by the Jardine Matheson "Bellerby" ship. It will probably be imported today and can arrive at the wharf the day after tomorrow. It can be unloaded early next week. Its amount is 8,632 tons. The local wheat market will inevitably be slightly affected. Yesterday, the Fuxin and Fufeng factories only handled 3,000 packages each, with a total of 6,000 packages traded. The highest price was 6 yuan and 7 jiao. The market continued to be stable.</p>
<h3>There Are Many Japonica Rice Arrivals and Few Sales. Senior Customers of Indica Rice Insist on Not Opening</h3>
<p>Japonica Rice</p>
<p>The source has changed and the arrival has increased. There are more than 10 ships down the river and 67,000 packages of wheeled vehicles. The early market was good at the beginning because the weather was cloudy and rainy. Later, the source of arrival gradually increased and the sales market slowed down. The going path of packages from this street and speculators has greatly declined. The market is stable. Thick japonica keeps the original market price and there is no glory or disgrace. And because the going path of thin japonica is allowed to be light, the price is stable and soft. Du Yang埠 sharp japonica follows the japonica market to stabilize. The exchange continues to see a scarcity of goods, and the going path is still hot, but the selling price is already outside 14 yuan, so it is difficult to be higher.</p>
<p>Indica rice</p>
<p>Although the arrival is endless and the inventory is sufficient, this street's various households are still concerned about this sharp cargo due to its high price. Yesterday's market decline was slightly reduced and the market remained stable. The Nanjing sharp tip of Te Gao is still asking for a price of 11 yuan, and the Gao Wu Indica rice is also asking for a price of 10 yuan 7 jiao 8 jiao. However, the incoming households are not as greedy as they were a few days ago. The transactions in the market are all high-quality goods in the large market, Gao Wu Indica rice is 10 yuan 6 jiao and a half, and 10 yuan 5 jiao and a half. The middle and secondary ones range from 10 yuan 34 jiao to about 9 yuan 9 jiao. The total market transaction was more than 1,000 packages.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji White Coal: More than 1,000 Tons Arrive</h3>
<p>The sales of Hongji white coal have increased sharply, but the accumulation of lump coal here is very rare, so that the supply does not meet the demand. The market continues to be excellent. Yesterday, more than 1,000 tons of the righteousness Thai and Yuding goods in this port arrived, and people's hearts gradually stabilized. The market price tends to be stable. The dismantling price for colleagues is estimated to be 45 yuan per ton for general lumps, 47 yuan for decorative lumps, and 49 yuan for test lumps. For goods leaving the warehouse, add another vehicle force to deliver.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Trends of Colored Cloth and White Goods Diverge. The Sales of Fine Twill Are Sluggish and the Selling Market Is Chaotic. The Colored Cloth Market Is Firm and the Output Is Insufficient</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>The trends of white goods and colored goods diverge, due to different stomach needs and huge differences in sales. The trend of fine cloth and fine twill is sluggish. Only this street bought 50 packages of dyed billet bottom-end fine twill, and the Sichuan gang bought 25 packages of rich and noble fine cloth. The Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shantou, and Hong Kong gangs all have scattered transactions. The market is chaotic. Retailers sell their hand goods for about one jiao cheaper per piece according to the market. The sales of coarse cloth are also good and the price is still firm. The price of fine yarn fabrics is increasing due to the high price of raw materials. The Guangzhong Factory's tribute is offered at 3 jiao, 9 fen, 2 li and a half per yard, and the serge is 3 jiao, 8 fen and 7 li and a half, an increase of 5 li per yard compared to last week. The business of blue cloth, colored twill and bleached cloth is the most brilliant. The Shu Gang added more than 3,000 pieces, and the Yunnan Gang also added nearly 2,000 pieces. The Subei Funing Gang bought 1,300 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, serge and Gongni. Shantou's demand is the strongest. Yesterday, they continued to add more than 100 boxes. Tianjin and Wen Yong Gang, and Quanzhou Gang also continued to purchase, so the colored cloth market is firm and the output is insufficient.</p>
<p>Dongbu</p>
<p>The market is firm and stable. The morning market softened slightly, but was aided by the Tianjin Gang's purchase of a large number of transactions. The dyeing cloth industry on this street also immediately tracked and purchased because the sales of colored cloth were not bad, and the price returned to firm. As a result, the middle and upper grades of fine cloth rose by two and a half to five fen compared with the previous day. The prices of bottom-end fine cloth and fine twill of each brand are flat. The Tianjin Gang bought nearly a thousand pieces of fine cloth and fine twill of each brand. The dyeing billet on this street and the wholesale and retail of customer gangs traded about 500 pieces. The tribute and serge of the inner and outer four gentlemen rose by 1 li 2 hao and a half per yard. The import appetite of the wholesale number on this street is still healthy. More than 50 boxes were traded.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>Today, the export of piece goods includes 30 pieces to Xiamen, 10 pieces to Hong Kong, 30 pieces to Haiphong, 70 pieces to Weihaiwei, and 240 pieces to Tianjin.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Fujian Education Department: Limiting the Age of Admission to Junior High School. This Year's Junior High School Admission Is Limited to Seventeen Years Old.</h3>
<p>(Yong'an Correspondence) The Fujian Education Department, in order to limit the age of students entering junior high school this year, instructed all middle schools in the province, saying, "The standard age of students in junior middle school is 12 years old to 15 years old, which has been stipulated in Article 4 of the revised Middle School Regulations. In recent years, most schools have not complied with this, and it is allowed to be based on the age of students newly recruited this year. According to reports, there are occasionally those who are 18 or over 20 years old, which seriously affects the efficiency of education and should be restricted. Now, in accordance with the regulations and with reference to the actual situation, it has been decided that the age of admission for junior high school students this year should be limited to seventeen years old. Students who are 18 years old or older will not be admitted. Those who have already been admitted should be refunded all fees paid and ordered to withdraw from school. In addition to distributing it, the school principal is ordered to strictly comply with it.</p>
<h3>Experiments in Wartime Education in Hubei (1)</h3>
<p>— Chen Jianxiao</p>
<p>Is wartime education the same as normal education? This is a question that educational scholars have debated most fiercely. Those who advocate that wartime education is the same as normal education believe that the two are essentially the same. They believe that the role of education is nothing more than to provide young students with sufficient and sound knowledge and skills so that they can succeed as good individuals and citizens, be able to serve society, and be able to strive for the survival of the country and the nation. In general theory, education is also a tool for continuing the life of the country and the nation, and its function is to store and enhance the spiritual and material strength of the country and the nation. This is the greatest purpose of education, and everyone will agree with it. Education is like this in peacetime, and education should be like this in wartime. Related basic preparation work, like scientific training, only seeks to strive for the construction of systematic knowledge, and then apply it to all aspects to explore the truth, which can naturally respond to infinity. However, this represents one school of thought. Others argue that wartime education and normal education should be somewhat different. In recent years, due to the imperialist ambitions of Japan, demands for education in extraordinary times, national crisis education, and national defense education have been repeatedly put forward. Since the War of Resistance, the call for wartime education or education during the War of Resistance has become even louder. The Ministry of Education has also established a wartime education research association, and educational circles have also initiated the organization of a national wartime education association in Hankou. It can be seen that wartime education and normal education do have some differences. The motivation is nothing more than wanting to use educational methods and forces to adapt to the period of war, or, like China's War of Resistance, various urgent needs, and to implement various temporary training. Therefore, a joint establishment method for secondary and higher schools in Hubei was drafted, which was approved by the Provincial Government Committee and reported by the Provincial Government to the Ministry of Education for record. Moreover, during the summer vacation, Minister Chen expressed his appreciation in person, believing that the principle was excellent and that special attention should be paid to the formulation of the method. Therefore, the work was started. Now, let’s give a general report on the operation of this joint school: (1) The distribution of branch schools dates back to the third phase of the War of Resistance. After the double achievement of Wuhan, the rear became an important town, and all military activities were centered here. Air raids were frequent, and the normal progress of education became almost impossible. Moreover, many educational and cultural institutions in the three towns of Wuhan were destroyed by enemy aircraft, resulting in very large losses. In order to plan for the long-term safety of faculty and students and to facilitate teaching, we planned to establish a large-scale joint secondary and higher school in early August, and set up high school, junior high school, girls’ high school junior high school, normal school, girls’ normal school, rural normal school vocational school, girls’ vocational school, agricultural college, senior agricultural school, senior technical school, senior commercial school, junior agricultural school, junior technical school and other branch schools in remote counties in western and northern Hubei, a total of twenty-two branch schools. Unfortunately, most of the branch schools are still concentrated in the counties of Badong, Enshi, and Jianshi, but this was indeed unavoidable. (2) The planning of branch school buildings: Immediately after the decision to establish the joint secondary and higher schools in early August, the Education Department successively sent nine staff members, including Shu Wenbo and Li Jianqing, to various counties in western and northern Hubei in August and September to survey the school buildings of the branch schools. Later, due to various difficulties such as food supply, transportation, security, and the current situation, except for a few locations that have been changed, the rest have found school buildings in the original towns. Most of them are temples, ancestral halls, or mansions of wealthy families. The Education Department issued repair funds to rush repairs and arrangements. Fortunately, they successively started school from the end of November to December 1st. The repair fee for each school ranged from one thousand yuan to four thousand four hundred yuan, and there were also a few exceptions that exceeded this amount. (3) The establishment of teaching affairs: All teaching facilities of the joint school have an experimental nature, but its curriculum content completely refers to the methods of national middle schools. Through spiritual training, all secondary school students understand a little military subject science, and all college students have a considerable understanding of various departments of job taking. At the same time, the painting, Chinese, and music subjects of umbrella high schools are appropriately reduced, and the time freed up is used to increase military training. Some provinces have even increased the time for military training to seven times that of peacetime. Such examples are too numerous to mention. In short, as the situation has evolved to the present stage, everyone has to believe that in order to win the War of Resistance and build the country, all school rules must be militarized, and all national salvation work must be educationalized. We have already reviewed the training outline for extraordinary times previously stipulated in Hubei, and we have also formulated military training teaching materials. The military training teaching materials for high school mainly focus on soldier training in the first academic year, with eight hours per week, and all students must participate. The second and third years mainly focus on junior officer training, and the time per week is also eight hours. As for students who are physically weak or for other reasons are not suitable for the above training, they are asked to freely participate in one of the five groups of air defense, guard, rescue, civil training, and engineering to achieve so-called rear service training, also eight hours per week. Therefore, from the perspective of facilities, education has indeed become wartime-oriented to meet wartime needs. After I arrived in Hubei at the end of June this year, I engaged in the reform of secondary and higher schools, which was also due to the environment and the situation of the times. All the changes regarding secondary schools do not dare to boast as our original insights, but are just products of the new environment of the great era. The biggest point of this reform of secondary and higher schools in Hubei is to jointly establish all public and private secondary and higher schools in Hubei (commonly referred to as the Hubei Joint School) to unify the will of the education community, value practical education, enhance educational effectiveness, and plan to develop the culture of remote counties in the province, relieve poor and out-of-school youths, and cultivate the vitality of the country and the nation to establish a foundation for the War of Resistance and national construction. Since Mr. Chen Cixiu, Chairman of the Provincial Government, put forward this great proposition, focusing on physical training, academic training, production labor training, and wartime rear service training, he promised not to reduce the original normal education level as a principle, and paid special attention to moral education. In addition to setting up a moral education team leader in each branch school, the number of moral education assistants was set up according to the number of classes in the branch school: one for six classes, and six for twenty-four classes. In addition, the tutor system was strictly implemented in accordance with the Ministry's order, with one to three grade tutors set up in each grade, and the moral education team leader seemed to be a head tutor.

<p>School Overview</p>
<h3>Shanghai North Primary and Secondary School</h3>
<p>Shanghai North Primary and Secondary School in this city was founded by Mr. Feng Mingquan of Xiehu and was established on July 7th of the seventh year of the Republic of China. It was initially named Shanghai North Public School, renting school buildings in Sanduoli, North Sichuan Road. The following year, it moved to Yileli and set up a branch school in Qipu Road. In the spring of the thirteenth year, it moved to Qiujiang Road again. In the sixteenth year, it was located in Taichangli on the same road and received rewards and assistance from the Shanghai North Engineering Patrol Donation Bureau. School affairs were developing day by day. In the seventeenth year, the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau approved a monthly subsidy. In the spring of the eighteenth year, Principal Feng Mingquan resigned due to old age, and the board of directors elected Feng Yixian to succeed him. Subsequently, a kindergarten was added and the school buildings were expanded. With the approval of the Municipal Education Bureau, the school was registered and the school name was changed to Private Shanghai North Primary and Secondary School. In the nineteenth year, a girls' department was established, and the number of students reached four hundred. The January 28th Shanghai Incident broke out, and the school was hit hard, suffering considerable losses. After the ceasefire, the school was reopened at No. 587 on the same road. Soon after, it was ordered to be renamed Shanghai North Junior High School and Shanghai North Primary School. In May of the twenty-third year, new school buildings for the primary school department were added. In the twenty-fifth year, the number of students exceeded one thousand. The girls' department was rebuilt on the adjacent land. When the August 13th Incident began in the twenty-sixth year, the entire school was destroyed by artillery fire, with losses of nearly 100,000 yuan. In the spring of the third year, at the request of students' parents, a temporary school building was set up at No. 541, North Shanxi Road, and classes were resumed. In response to environmental needs, the Ministry of Education of the National Government was requested to add a high school.</p>
<p>The existing temporary school building is less than one-eighth of the pre-war size, so it can only accommodate more than 500 people (half as many as before the war). There are more than 30 faculty and staff members, such as Feng Zhen and Qi Juechen, who are all former employees. Although the school buildings and equipment are not as good as in the past, the teaching spirit of teachers and students is thousands of times better than before the war. Observing the school, it is progressing more and more. The future development should be limitless.</p>

<h3>Charity Football Match During the Abolished Lunar New Year: Li Huitang Will Come to Shanghai to Join the China United Team as Center Forward. There Will Be Two Charity Matches, Both at Yiyuan.</h3>
<p>The charity football match co-organized by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Refugee Relief Association has been progressing smoothly since it began to be planned. The preparatory authorities recently consulted with Western football clubs, the person in charge of Yiyuan, and Chinese sports leaders. The result was very satisfactory. It was decided to hold two matches during the abolished Lunar New Year, roughly between the China United Team and the West United Team, and between Donghua and Lido. The dates are the 20th and 21st of January in the Gregorian calendar. The match venues are both at Yiyuan Stadium on Albert Road. The ticket revenue will be used to fund refugee relief, and the International Relief Committee will send a special letter to Zhou Shouchen, inviting the football prodigy Li Huitang to come to Shanghai to participate. It is said that Li has agreed generously. Mr. Li has been away from Shanghai for a long time. His return to Shanghai will definitely cause a sensation, increase revenue, and benefit the victims. Football prodigy Li Huitang has generously agreed to come to Shanghai to participate, representing China United as center forward. This is his original position, and he will definitely attract a large number of fans. In the past two years, he has repeatedly considered giving up his football career, but he has been persuaded by all parties to continue to appear on the green field. This season, the Hong Kong football scene has been extremely excited because of Li's return. However, in addition to participating in charity matches, he does not often play. His performance is still as impressive as it was in his prime. Although he is not as sharp as he used to be, his goal-scoring skills are still amazing. Therefore, every time he appears on the field, there are records. Since Li has been invited to come north during the abolished Lunar New Year, it will be difficult for him to participate in the Hong Kong-Manila inter-port match, because that match is also held at that time.</p>

<h3>Vans Wins Again, Equalizing the Record with Budge at Four Wins Each</h3>
<p>(Minneapolis, 15th Reuters) Vans and Budge played their eighth professional tennis match here tonight at the Wheeler Sports Arena. Vans rallied after losing the first set and won the next two sets to defeat Budge with a score of 2-6, 6-2, 6-4. In total, the two have won four games each, tying the record. Vans' baseline long shots and online volleys today were successful, forcing Budge to retreat to defense and unable to attack. However, it once aroused the audience's cheers. The general opinion is that if Budge could have worked a little harder in today's game, he might have been able to win.</p>

<h3>To the Fourth District of Guoyang</h3>
<p>——A Memoir of Breaking Through from Xuzhou</p>
<p>After half a day of fierce fighting, we finally arrived at Xulu at nine o'clock last night. As we passed through Xulu at night, the enemy who ambushed us abandoned three or four hundred corpses and a large number of guns and ammunition, and fled in a panic.</p>
<p>We shared the captured spoils of war, and the team continued to advance mightily.</p>
<p>The sky was so clear that there wasn't a single cloud. The sun was terribly scorching, and the sand and soil on the road were baked as hot as a red-hot iron pot. The wheat seedlings in the fields lay quietly under the gentle caress of the sun.</p>
<p>There was no wind at all. I dragged a tree branch, and with my feet, which were covered in blisters that had broken and re-formed, then broken a second time and re-formed, I limped along the scorching hot dirt road. I was terribly thirsty, and sweat kept pouring down.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an enemy plane appeared in the sky. The advancing troops immediately hid under the trees and in the wheat fields.</p>
<p>The enemy plane circled overhead once, and when it found nothing, flew away. Then, the troops reassembled into a stream of iron and continued to advance.</p>
<p>As soon as we encountered water, even if it was very dirty, people swarmed around it like a hive of bees, fighting to drink it.</p>
<p>It was already past five o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived at the fourth district of Guoyang County. This was a fairly large ancient city, but it was already empty, with not a single resident left. It is said that the enemy had occupied this place a week ago, and the enemy's telephone lines were still left outside the city...</p>
<p>I couldn't find anything to eat in the city. Carrying the unbearable hunger and fatigue of not having had a good night's sleep or a decent meal for several days, I went to a stone bridge more than ten zhang long and more than two zhang wide outside the city and sat down to wait for the team to depart.</p>
<p>At this time, the sun had just set below the horizon, and the western sky was a brilliant rosy glow. The evening breeze brought a refreshing coolness that made people feel light and relaxed, gently blowing. Under the bridge was the half-clear water of the Guoyang River, and three or four ducks, whose owners had probably fled to who knows where, were leisurely swimming in the river.</p>
<p>Looking at this poetic scenery, my tense heart, which had been living in battle every day, suddenly became leisurely, and I almost forgot that we were breaking through.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a group of people came across the bridge. Among them were Northeastern soldiers, Sichuan soldiers, Guangxi soldiers... Watching their difficult way of walking, like little old women, twisting their waists as they walked, I almost couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>In fact, the way we walked was no different from them, but we had forgotten our own pain.</p>
<p>After midnight, in the bright moonlight, the team solemnly set off towards Guoyang along the highway.</p>
<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>— Liu You</p>
<p>The fully grown, large tree, although it has no fruit, is decorated with clusters of green leaves, making it look very young. The small bird, with its newly grown feathers, can already sing very lovely songs, showing that it is a clever little animal. This tree, this little bird, they are the matured buds, they symbolize the morning.</p>
<p>Every morning, I always look forward to it, hoping that this day, this precious day, will not be in vain in my striving journey.</p>
<p>Every morning, I always have a dedication, blessing one day of my life; at this time, I am the most refreshed, the happiest, and it can be said that I am the greatest, the most sincere!</p>
<p>In the morning, I have washed away my sins of yesterday. In my innocent heart, I am about to grasp my perseverance, break out of the thorny bushes, jump out of the rugged paths, and wait for the new dawn to arrive.</p>
<p>From the faint light of dawn until the sun rises high, the radiant sunshine indicates to us a bright future. The high crowing of the rooster is a wake-up call, or an exhortation. The morning will not make us sad or despair in the slightest.</p>
<p>There is a morning every day, and every morning is equally precious. It is deeply loved by everyone.</p>
<p>Every morning is a symbol of us obtaining beautiful fruits!</p>
<h3>Village Chief Chen</h3>
<p>— Shan</p>
<p>Dusk and drizzling rain. In the dilapidated hall, the light of day will withdraw its last rays from the window on the table. Three or four villagers, shivering, received certificates from the village chief's hand, blinked their red eyes, and quietly slipped out. Bullets were flying huffily in the sky, landing on the tiles like sparrows. Village Chief Chen put down his pen, looked at the sky, and sighed, as if he had completed a great feat, and became intoxicated with himself. Rain flew in from the half-open window, dripping on the roots of Village Chief Chen's unshaven beard, and he felt cold. At this time, everyone in front of and behind the village had already fled, leaving a few dogs wagging their tails at the village chief by the roadside. The sky darkened further, and the rain showed no sign of stopping. Nearby, it was as quiet as death, while in the distance, there was a constant sound of gunfire, forming a harmonious pattern like falling hail. The dog took a stance and pounced to one side. Following its gaze, it was one of our soldiers, looking around and coming this way. The dogs stood far away, watching him, retreating and barking. Village Chief Chen asked the soldier and learned that he was lost and wanted to go to Taiping Bridge. He suddenly felt the urgency of the situation. He went back inside and saw his old mother fingering Buddhist beads and chanting, with his wife and children standing beside her, each holding a bundle of clothes, preparing to take refuge. Someone rushed in from outside, it was the voice of his close friend Mr. Xue:</p>
<p>"The soldiers are very close, aren't you leaving yet? Don't get caught!"</p>
<p>"We'll leave soon, but I'm afraid there are still villagers who are reluctant to leave. I have to tell them to take refuge temporarily."</p>
<p>Village Chief Chen asked Mr. Xue to sit and wait for a while, then put on his galoshes and hurried out to the bridge. Village Chief Chen himself agreed to be the guide, and turned back and ran home.</p>
<p>"Shen Geng, Shen Geng, light the lamp and come with me, to send a soldier to the front line!"</p>
<p>His son silently lit the lamp and darted out. Mr. Xue stammered that he wanted to go, but Village Chief Chen wouldn't allow it, entrusting him to accompany his old mother at home.</p>
<p>Thus, three people, an umbrella, a lamp, swayed and disappeared into the darkness, gradually only seeing the lamp shaking like a firefly, and then disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>Mr. Xue stayed with Old Mrs. Chen and waited until midnight without seeing the village chief return. Everyone became anxious. The gunfire grew closer and closer, and bullets even fell from the roof, forcing everyone to lie flat on the ground.</p>
<p>It was dawn, and they couldn't move anymore. Enemy soldiers had already covered the village, and the whole village was filled with bullets. Everyone hid, not daring to show their faces. Fortunately, they were not found by the enemy soldiers, but Village Chief Chen had not returned.</p>
<p>After another day, the battle line had shifted. Mr. Xue risked going out and followed the road towards Taiping Bridge. At Yangjia Bridge, the old man in the teahouse cracked open the door and beckoned to Mr. Xue. Mr. Xue flashed inside, and the old man closed the door, widened his eyes, and whispered:</p>
<p>"Has the village chief returned home? That night, he accompanied a soldier and passed by here. The lamp ran out of oil, and he added some here. The gunfire at that time was really frightening. I said let me lead the way, but he wouldn't let me work hard, saying the outside was quite slippery, saving the old man from wearing boots and carrying an umbrella. Since then, I haven't heard of him coming back, and I'm always worried, worried..."</p>
<p>Mr. Xue became anxious and, disregarding the old man's rambling, slipped back onto the street. There were many corpses on the street. After a while, he finally encountered a living person, Wang Si. Wang Si said he saw the village chief sitting by the roadside.</p>
<p>"At this time, sitting by the roadside?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sitting by the roadside. I saw him from afar, it was Village Chief Chen."</p>
<p>The two men went around the piles of corpses and arrived at a place. Village Chief Chen was sitting by the roadside, his eyes lowered and closed, as if he were sound asleep. Shen Geng was lying on the ground, stark naked, covered in blood and gore.</p>
<p>"Village Chief, Village Chief, have you gone to heaven?" Wang Si cried, and Mr. Xue also knelt down.</p>
<p>"Village Chief, Village Chief, we will always remember you!"</p>
<h3>Captured Alive</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>In the evening, two men wearing plasters as badges came to Daotiao Alley to take a look. As soon as they saw the person standing at the door, they rejoiced together, thinking, "We know there must be a young woman here; haha! You escaped us several times before, but this time you can't escape!"</p>
<p>Grinning maliciously, they quickened their pace and headed straight for the target.</p>
<p>As they approached, the woman turned and went into the house, slamming the door shut behind her.</p>
<p>"What! Not letting us in!"</p>
<p>Slightly annoyed, one of them said, and the other kicked the door open, seeing the woman still running in the hall, they grinned again.</p>
<p>There were two men husking rice in the gatehouse, and two men weaving bamboo ware under the porch, but they were so blinded by lust that they were oblivious to everyone else. Their eyes were only on the woman, and they went straight inside to chase her.</p>
<p>The woman in front turned after passing through the hall, stepped into the inner room, and closed the door. The door was not as sturdy as the main gate, and it was easier to kick open. Like an eagle catching a chick, two strong men catching a weak woman was supposed to be easy. They pinned her to the bed.</p>
<p>"Good! Where do you think you can escape to now! Saying you were already dead, are you a ghost?"</p>
<p>"She is pretty, not bad! Even if she's a ghost, a pretty ghost, we'll do it!"</p>
<p>Just four days ago, these two men with plasters as badges had come here under the pretext of investigating household registration to search for people. At that time, the mistress of the house, having been notified by the lookout at the village entrance, was lying in the field, not caring that her shoes, socks, and clothes were dirty, covering her head and face with straw. But although she had not been discovered, because she was busy hiding, she had left a pair of fashionable square-toed leather shoes in the room, forgetting to tidy them up. When they saw them, they were convinced that there was a young woman in this house. The family repeatedly said that the shoes were relics of the dead, but they didn't believe them. They investigated in various ways, using biscuits to lure the children: "Where is your mother?" and using words to threaten them. Therefore, they came here every day.</p>
<p>The woman pinned to the bed naturally struggled, but she did not shout or panic, but instead gave a cold smile.</p>
<p>"Good!"</p>
<p>Saying this, she grabbed the mouths of the two men pinning her down with one hand each, and immediately the curtain behind the bed suddenly lifted, and four strong hands reached out. At the same time, two strong men jumped out from behind the cabinet, quickly tied up the two men with plasters as badges, and tightly gagged their mouths so they could not make a sound. Two warriors tying up a licentious villain was like wielding a knife with ease; even if they couldn't hold them, the main gate had long been tightly closed, and there were warriors outside the room pretending to husk rice and weave bamboo ware, ready and waiting.</p>
<p>It turned out that, because the matter of the shoes causing them to come looking for a woman every day was known to the patriots operating in the lost territory, they recognized it as a good opportunity and immediately contacted the guerrilla fighters, agreeing on this plan. The original mistress of the house was so frightened that she fell ill and hid in the mountains. The mistress who was used as bait was also disguised by a brave female patriot.</p>
<p>To intimidate the common people, these two prisoners were both fully armed. Taking away their guns and ammunition could be used to help the guerrillas. But their mouths were even more worth using. Without worrying about language barriers, there were many people in the guerrilla team who were proficient in foreign languages; therefore, they first made it clear to the tied-up men that they also had beloved wives, and were driven by others, which is why they had become depraved and trapped in a desperate situation. They were moved, and their bonds were released. They voluntarily reported the military situation in the town. Using this clue, they soon caused the enemy's military vehicle to derail and cut off the railway, achieving a great victory.</p>
<h3>My Singing</h3>
<p>— Du Mao Xiang</p>
<p>Damn it!</p>
<p>I've been doing this for so many years,</p>
<p>But I've never seen the changes in the world today.</p>
<p>When I was a young lad, I wandered around Shandong,</p>
<p>Later I went to the edge of the East Sea to stroll,</p>
<p>After I grew up, I floated in Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>In the green mountains, dense bamboo, and sparse pines,</p>
<p>In the white pond, rice seedlings, and reeds,</p>
<p>In the wilderness, ancient tombs, and creeping grass,</p>
<p>Is where my home is.</p>
<p>When times are hard, I warm up a casserole to sprout soybeans,</p>
<p>When I'm happy, I smuggle salt and move earth a few times;</p>
<p>When I have blood money, I relax,</p>
<p>Play with flower girls and drink from big cups.</p>
<p>Who doesn't recognize me, Mao Xiang, running around the Jianghu!</p>
<p>Life is flavorful! Exhilarating!</p>
<p>If it hadn't been for my younger brother Xiao Shandong getting into trouble that year,</p>
<p>I would never have been framed and sent to my maternal uncle's house to sit in jail.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>Last year, the ×× soldiers came to attack, and I was granted amnesty,</p>
<p>Hoping to have a good time.</p>
<p>Who knew those damn planes, cannons, and bombs,</p>
<p>A wildfire burned away all the high-rise buildings, foreign houses, thatched huts, fields;</p>
<p>Watching my compatriots separated from their wives and children,</p>
<p>Brothers beheaded,</p>
<p>Daughters violated;</p>
<p>The ××'s military music is melodious,</p>
<p>The troops advance horizontally and vertically:</p>
<p>My ambition, Mao Xiang, can no longer be aroused,</p>
<p>I regret that I did wrong in the past,</p>
<p>Bullying my own people instead of pointing my gun outwards.</p>
<p>Brothers!</p>
<p>Now the land has changed color,</p>
<p>The home country has fallen,</p>
<p>Nothing will ever be exhilarating again.</p>
<p>Look at those Koreans, Taiwanese, and Indian A-sans,</p>
<p>If you have a bit of humanity,</p>
<p>You should recognize clearly, reflect again and again.</p>
<p>The ××'s won't leave,</p>
<p>They will never give up;</p>
<p>Only bastards become traitors,</p>
<p>Cowardly grandsons kneel to others.</p>
<p>Come! Come! Come!</p>
<p>Drink a cup,</p>
<p>We are all our own people,</p>
<p>Let's use our brains,</p>
<p>And do something exhilarating.</p>
<p>Let's swear an oath with blood,</p>
<p>To drive the ××'s out!</p>

<h3>Ill-gotten gains never prosper</h3>
<p>— Lishi</p>
<p>Every cause has an effect, and every effect has a cause; the same cause will produce the same effect. This is the law of all natural phenomena.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Plant melons and you get melons, plant beans and you get beans." Planting melons and planting beans is the cause, and getting melons and getting beans is the effect. Therefore, "What comes in unjustly will go out unjustly." Having the cause of unjust gains, one cannot escape the effect of unjust losses.</p>
<p>Planting melons and getting melons, planting beans and getting beans, is the harvest of cultivation, the reward of labor, and belongs to what is normal. And in general, only those undertakings that are created successfully through a normal and arduous process can be preserved permanently. As for those who obtain gains unjustly, these are unexpected encounters, temporary strokes of good fortune, and are abnormal. Because of these unexpected and fortunate gains, the parties involved are tempted by chance, leading to a blurred understanding. They fall because of the effect, so they lose unjustly; some even suffer ruin, lose their reputations, and their family property is swept away, getting to the point of being beyond repair.</p>
<p>Stories of ill-gotten gains never prosper are most often found in gambling dens. The act of gambling is inherently prompted by chance, and moreover, when gamblers gamble wildly, their reason has long disappeared, and they no longer understand this cause and effect of ill-gotten gains never prosper. Therefore, the money won at first is still lost in the end. Some don't count their losses and continue to gamble, and the more they gamble, the more they lose. The so-called winning makes them want to win more, and losing makes them want to recoup their losses. Who knows, the deeper they try to recoup, the deeper they sink. This is the psychology and the cause of the downfall of gamblers.</p>
<p>Our eastern neighbor, the "friendly nation," its rise can be said to be mostly accidental and fortunate. It went through the Sino-Japanese War, then the Russo-Japanese War, and then the World War, and thus gradually became stronger. It knew that they neglected objective factors, but used war as a magic weapon for becoming stronger, leading to years of militarism and warlords in power, intending to complete the delusion of a "continental empire," and starting the fire of aggression at the Marco Polo Bridge. Who would have thought that, as the facts now show, the strength they gained from war in the past has now been lost in war.</p>
<p>Yes, they were unjust gainers in the past, so they cannot avoid being unjust losers now. They wanted to win more after winning in the past, and they want to recoup their losses now after losing, so they will inevitably fall into the tragic situation of trying to recoup but sinking deeper and deeper.</p>
<h3>Returning After Seeing Liu Haisu's Recent Works</h3>
<p>— Xinan</p>
<p>Looking at paintings is not an easy matter, because looking at paintings requires understanding painting. To not understand painting and yet pretend to be elegant and go to look at paintings, is truly like "a blind man looking at a painted wall." But I am indeed one of those people.</p>
<p>When I was in school, I had two hours of drawing a week. The teacher was also a somewhat famous painter in Hangzhou. Because schools had only just started being established in the late Qing Dynasty, and painters who graduated from schools were still being trained, most of what was drawn at that time were brush-style pencil drawings, which later turned into what was then called geometric drawing. But in drawing class, I only saw the teacher drawing rustlingly on the blackboard, and me, I often drew mice that looked like rabbits, and goats that looked like white dogs with whiskers. If the teacher hadn't added a few strokes for me, I would never have been able to hand in my work!</p>
<p>In recent years, I often go to art exhibitions for sightseeing, which is nothing more than killing time. Moreover, where we live, there are no gardens to stroll in. We have neither the time nor the money. What I can sit and lie down and admire is limited to a few old paintings and calligraphy in my small room—new ones are too expensive to buy, and I can't find anything else pleasing to the eye. So, if there is a calligraphy and painting exhibition to browse, whether I understand it or not, I'm happy to take a trip. Going to see Liu Haisu's recent works was also with this intention.</p>
<p>The four words "artistic traitor" had already been shocking. Moreover, his works were universally praised, so there was no need to say more. I will only write out the situation of the exhibition.</p>
<p>This so-called recent exhibition was dominated by traditional Chinese paintings. According to his exhibition catalog, there were a total of one hundred and forty-nine pieces, with only twenty oil paintings and one hundred and twenty-nine traditional Chinese paintings. Oil paintings accounted for only about 14 percent, showing that Haisu's recent works are gradually focusing more on traditional Chinese painting. Perhaps it was to allow the Chinese people to see them, so he deliberately reduced the number of oil paintings on display to the minimum.</p>
<p>Haisu's traditional Chinese paintings seem to have been learned from Bada Shanren and modern artists such as Wu Changshuo and Wang Yiting, so-called rough brushwork. Rough brushwork not only requires charm, but also requires boldness. Many modern people who learn from Wu and Wang see only "a black mess," which is a big mistake. Although it is said to be rough brushwork and not focused on meticulousness, the standards still cannot be reduced. The more sparse the strokes, the more extraordinary the work. This is also something that comes naturally with practice, and cannot be forced.</p>
<p>Charm, I say, is the characteristic of traditional Chinese painting, but it can be understood spiritually, not verbally. Sometimes, with a painting, subtracting a stroke is impossible, and adding a stroke is impossible. When it is just right, that is a divine work. As for the composition of the painting, it is related to the structure of a painting. For example, in one of the exhibited paintings, Wang Yiting added a bright moon. One must observe whether the composition of the painting actually needs this bright moon. The artist will naturally understand this, but as an amateur like me, I simply don't understand the logic.</p>
<p>Liu Haisu's imitation of Mi Fu's splashed-ink landscape painting, he inscribed himself (the original words are not clear in my memory) that Mi Fu's landscape paintings are between intentional and unintentional; his own imitations are also between resembling and not resembling Mi Fu, which are true words. Whether writing or painting, one cannot but take something as a model. But no matter how wonderful and lifelike the imitation, the result is still an imitation! Therefore, the reason why a painter is a painter, and a master is a master, whether it is landscape, figure, birds, or flowers, is always the same, the only difference is this little bit of charm. It can be seen that in imitation, one must also have one's own mastery.</p>
<p>The so-called recent exhibition, because most of them were recent works, but there was an inscription that seemed to have been written in the winter of the twenty-eighth year. If it is not a mistake in my memory, it is easy to cause viewers to be confused for a moment, because the general psychology of most people attributes the current winter to the twenty-seventh year. Fortunately, this is unimportant, and perhaps I am misremembering.</p>
<p>Among the paintings, there were also inscriptions by Lin Sen, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, and Ye Gongchao, which further increased their value. But I think that for appraising a painting, it is best to ask a painter to appraise it. If I could paint, I would definitely ask Feng Chaoran, Tang Dingzhi, Zhao Shuju, and Shang Shengbo to appraise it, which would be meaningful.</p>
<p>After all is said and done, I haven't said what Liu Haisu's recent works are like, and mostly empty talk, saying too much about him. Is it to get some稿費 from Spring and Autumn to subsidize the cost of the admission ticket? Perhaps there is also this intention in it, a smile.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 2: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Director Jin Eloquently Discusses the Concept of Equality</p>
<p>Miss Jin Danyun snorted through her nose and said, "What you're saying is contradictory." Lin Jiancheng said, "How can you say that what I'm saying is contradictory?" Miss Jin said, "Let me ask you! That eight-story Workers' First Building at Brahma Ferry, was it designed and built by you?" Lin Jiancheng smiled and nodded. Miss Jin said, "I've taken foreign guests to visit it before. If you're talking about standardization, there's no building more standardized than that one, and yet you say you don't approve of standardization. If you don't approve of standardization, why did you design and build such a building yourself?" Miss Jin turned to the two Miss He families and said, "That building was specially built for workers to live in, and it has countless small rooms inside. This one building can house four or five hundred families, all of them workers' families. But the houses are almost the same, the rooms are the same, and the furniture inside, like beds, tables, and chairs, are also the same. Like room 301 and room 302, they are exactly the same. Someone who is a little careless will walk into someone else's house when they go home. I asked the person in charge of the workers' residences, and he said, 'This is called standardization. When building the houses, our engineers standardized them.' I asked him, 'Who is the engineer?' Well! It's Mr. Lin Jiancheng! Now he's saying he doesn't approve of standardization, so I have to ask him." Lin Jiancheng laughed and said, "Alright, Miss! I should be subject to your criticism. But there are several reasons for building this building, and it's not that my words don't match my actions. First, it was a commission, and before the building was built, it was intended to be used as workers' housing, so it was enough to be sturdy, simple, and hygienic. Since there are so many rooms, it's impossible for each one to be different. Second, the building was built very quickly, because after the war, China's industry was booming, and there was a panic about workers' housing, so it had to be built within eight months. In order to make it faster to build, many things had to be standardized. For example, the steel windows, water pipes, and sanitary equipment in the house were all ready-made, manufactured according to certain standards, and just had to be installed in the house, wouldn't that save time and effort? Third, in that building, except for a few rooms that are used for public facilities, the rent for the rest is the same. Since the rent is the same, the houses are bound to be the same. But as you said just now, there are often some careless people who go to the wrong house and cause a lot of jokes."</p>

<p>— Hong Tao</p>
<p>Nanjing Road was originally the center of the concessions, but now it is the center of the entire Shanghai. The phenomenon of Shanghai as an isolated island can be seen in its entirety from Nanjing Road. In the short span of just over a year, Nanjing Road has undergone considerable changes. The desolation of Nanjing Road at the beginning of the August 13th Incident is a far cry from the bustling and lively scene of today, truly two extreme situations that one could never have imagined. This transformation is the most unique page in the history of Nanjing Road's rise and fall.</p>
<p>Before the war, Nanjing Road was certainly the most prosperous place, but this prosperity was merely a superficial appearance due to its location. Its inner reality could not hide the pervasive recession. The radios, huge discount banners, and drumming of the shops only embellished a semblance of vitality. The three times of day—morning, noon, and evening—when people went to and from work were somewhat noisy, but during the rest of the time, although the road was constantly filled with pedestrians, not all shops were necessarily thriving. The impressive giants like Taifeng, Ningbo Shiye Bank, Dashengfu, and Dahu Bank were empty. However, the current situation is completely different. People crowd the street from morning till night. An unknown number of new shops have been added to the not-very-long road. The previously mentioned giant buildings have now acquired new owners and have undergone a complete transformation. The original site of Taifeng is now Qiu Tianbao Jewelry (Nanjing Road now has two Qiao Tianbao stores. The branch is across from the old Jiulun; the main store was formerly at Xiaodongmen). The original site of Ningbo Shiye Bank is now Dachang Silk Shop, the original site of Dashengfu is now China National Products Company, and a building across from Hongyi that was previously the Shanghai National Products Company before the war. After Wu Zhihao's various businesses failed, the building was left vacant. After the war, it was used as a refugee shelter, and the building was severely damaged. But now it has become a new building with a cement facade. Its new owner is Fang Jiuxia Jewelry, which has returned to Nanjing Road. The Dahu Building of Dahu Bank has now been renamed the Xin Daxiang Building. The splendid facade of Xin Daxiang has also added infinite excitement to Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>The new shops that have recently opened on Nanjing Road are mostly silk shops, jewelers, pharmacies, and ginseng and bird's nest stores. Among them, the pharmacies are shops featuring a northern style. The rest are mostly transferred from Xiaodongmen.</p>
<p>The two major companies, Zhongda Company, on Nanjing Road have both renovated their storefronts. The first to renovate was Xinxin, at the end of the year before last. The Hong Kong-style corridor was replaced, and the storefront windows were rebuilt in their original location. The facade was changed to milky yellow marble, but perhaps the construction was not very elaborate. Only a short time later, the color already looked somewhat dull. The latter was Sincere, which also changed its bottom floor facade to light yellow marble. It seems that it has not yet been fully completed, and all of Sincere's glass awnings have been changed to cement. This is presumably because the previous iron frames were bent by the impact of the bomb and could not be straightened completely, so they could only be covered with cement.</p>
<p>The bomb scars on Sincere seem to have completely disappeared, but the author has discovered an irreparable flaw: the two coiled dragon pillars that were replaced on Sincere's second-floor veranda have coiled dragons whose posture is the opposite of the original ones. The original ones were coiled upward, and the newly replaced ones are coiled downward. This may be a temporary oversight by the workers, but this can truly leave a trace of this trauma. In the future, if someone repairs the anecdotes of Nanjing Road, this is one of the major events of Nanjing Road. I think these words can be used as evidence, so I do not hesitate to write more about it here.</p>
<h3>Street Artists</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>In the crowded city streets, which resemble a flowing tide, there is never a moment of interruption or rest from morning to dusk and into the late night. There are idlers wandering, people rushing to make a living, those busy pursuing wealth, and the unemployed wandering about. This coming and going has created a special kind of excitement on the streets. As a result, unemployed people with artistic production skills can use their skills to barter with the public for the material sustenance of life. The diligence and enterprising spirit of these strugglers in this sphere of life certainly elevates the evaluation of the ancient saying, "Having a skill is better than a thousand pieces of gold." Therefore, I will give a brief report on some street artists:—</p>
<p>Silhouette Cutting In Shanghai, silhouette cutters seem to have only appeared on the streets in recent years. They hang a piece of cardboard along the edge of the street, with various cut-out portraits attached. Holding a pair of scissors and a few sheets of black paper, they do not need to shout loudly or advertise. They simply stand silently in a corner, waiting for admirers to patronize them. They only charge five or ten cents for each portrait they cut, and it can be taken immediately. Ordinary wanderers or people who have never seen it before and feel a sense of novelty will surely not begrudge these few cents and commission them to take a contour of their own appearance from the scissors. Therefore, their daily harvest is enough to fill their stomachs.</p>
<p>Wire Twisting Twisting various fonts with fine copper wire is also a rather interesting game. They can use a copper wire and the turning and bending of a pair of iron pliers to quickly twist out hollow Chinese or Western characters, or a phrase of several characters connected in one idiom. People who twist words have pure skills in production, because there is no opportunity to cheat. Whether it is similar or not has objective criticism. It is not like the production of silhouettes, where if it is not similar, you can still find words to cover it up. Therefore, people who are not skilled are difficult to produce. Most people who operate this kind of wire twisting sit on the ground in the corner of the road, setting up a simple stall. Twisting a three-character connected name costs twenty cents, and other auspicious idioms such as double happiness, longevity, and good fortune, as well as "long life and a hundred years," and "grand opening" are charged double. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Group of Performers on the Road</h3>
<p>— Xin Shi</p>
<p>Recently, a traveling filmmaker from Sichuan and Yunnan spoke in detail about the recent situation of various artists on the road. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei Before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he was invited to the Wuhan Military Camp Film Division to go to Hankou with Li Lili to star in the film "Iron-Blooded Loyalty." At first, they were both hired for a short-term nature of one film. After the war broke out, they continued to serve there and did not plan to return. After the fall of Wuhan and the retreat to Chongqing, he once abandoned his work in the film industry and changed to a clerical position in the Aviation Administration. He was repeatedly strongly invited by the Central Film Studio before he returned to his old career.</p>
<p>Cao Yu</p>
<p>Playwright Cao Yu and Chen Baichen are now in Chongqing at the National Drama School, where they are in charge of teaching affairs. There are more than eighty students in the entire school, located in Shangqing Temple outside the city. In addition to their coursework, they often lead students to perform his famous works "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise" and new dramas in local theaters. Filmmakers from "China Electric" also often join in cooperation.</p>
<p>Sun Yu</p>
<p>He is working as a director at "China Electric." Since the retreat to Chongqing, his work has been hindered because various equipment has not been fully prepared. He has only made one historical film, "Yue Fei," but it does have its own unique power in anti-Japanese propaganda.</p>
<p>Zhao Huishen</p>
<p>The Amateur Theater Troupe set off for Sichuan and performed in Chongqing for a long time. After that, they transferred to Chengdu and are still continuing to perform indefinitely. Zhao Dan, Gu Er and Shi Chao, key members of the troupe, had disagreements with the director Chen Liting and others midway, and soon announced their separation there, returned to Chongqing, and transferred to "China Electric." At that time, "Amateur" was also joined by a group of actors from the Filmmakers' Theater Troupe, and was changed to be the responsibility of Chen Liting and Zhao Huishen. Zhao has been in charge of scriptwriting and acting for the troupe. She and Chen Liting had already fallen in love, and in May or June of last year, they had a crystallization in Chengdu.</p>
<p>Xie Yunqing</p>
<p>He has been wandering for a long time on the long journey. After arriving in Sichuan, his life has undergone a change. The companions of the Filmmakers' Theater Troupe are not very satisfied with this. Xie Yunqing also sought another way out and joined a song and dance troupe, wandering around Yunnan and Guizhou. Some time ago, someone met him in Kunming. He looked like a wanderer on the road and was very depressed.</p>
<p>Wang Ying</p>
<p>Wang Ying was with Hong Shen, Jin Shan, and others in the second team of the National Salvation Drama Troupe. At that time, they performed in various places such as Nanjing and Xuzhou. After arriving in Hankou, Hong Shen took a position in the Drama Section of the Third Hall of the Political Department. She and Jin Shan also joined the China Film Studio to make films for a while. Later, when Wuhan fell and the National Army retreated to the west, their news was cut off for a long time. Recently, I heard that they had already arrived in Guilin and were still bravely flying the banner of the National Salvation Drama Troupe, leading a group of partners to work hard on national salvation propaganda there.</p>
<p>The rest of the large group of filmmakers, Bai Yang, Chen Bo'er, Shen Xiling, and Wei Heling, are mostly concentrated in Chongqing, affiliated with the two major state-owned film studios, and their lives are generally quite good.</p>
<h3>After Watching the One-Act Play "Dawn"</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Performed by the Second China Vocational Supplementary School</p>
<p>The night before yesterday, I walked into the Ningbo Tongxiang Association with excitement, and participated in the teacher-student get-together organized by the Second China Vocational Supplementary School. In addition to the general order, the program of the get-together was followed by recreational activities. Among the eight or nine recreational performances, I believe that the drama "Dawn," performed by the school's drama troupe, was the most able to arouse the audience's excitement and raise the audience's awareness of the Anti-Japanese War, and it truly met these two principles. "Dawn" is a one-act play, and its plot is quite tense. It describes a pair of laborers who sell their blood and sweat, Fusheng and Lianxiang, whose occupations were destroyed by the flames of the "August 13th" Incident.</p>
<p>Fusheng is a worker in a factory. After losing his job, he stretched out his hand and hoped that the factory could resume operation. A year later, the factory finally reopened. However, the capitalists' calculations became more and more sophisticated. They tried their best to use the lowest price to buy a large number of refugees who were at the end of their rope and wandering the streets, and tried their best to abandon old friends who had exhausted their fat and blood. "Retaining jobs with suspended pay" and "hiring one by one" are, of course, the only nice and fashionable slogans for capitalists to treat old workers.</p>
<p>Similarly, his wife, Lianxiang, found a job as a female worker in a cigarette factory, but after only a few months, an unfortunate child was added. For the sake of life, she had to leave the child at home and ask her neighbor Yingniang to take care of him. The poor child could not get the love of his mother, and could not get enough food and warmth, and finally unfortunately became ill. Alas, God! This whip of life beat her family to pieces. Fusheng passively took the road of passive suicide. He could not bear the reprimand of his conscience, and motivated by maternal love, he could not bear to watch his poor child be born in such pain and die tragically. It was not easy to borrow three dollars of wages from the factory, and give it to her husband, to give the child medical treatment and medicine.</p>
<p>However, Fusheng, who had become negative and committed suicide, drank and gambled all day long to relieve his worries. Confused, he drank and lost all the money for the child's medical treatment. He was angry for a while, drank more wine, took a knife, and guarded the entrance of the capitalist he used to work for. Taking advantage of his carelessness, he killed the capitalist who had exploited the blood and sweat of the workers. He felt happy! Frustrated! Frightened! Hiding outside and wandering! Although, he really couldn't let go of his child in his heart...! The drama closed with such a tight plot. "Why are Fusheng and Lianxiang unemployed? What is the child's illness? How painful is Lianxiang after knowing her husband's behavior?..." This is probably the question that every audience member is thinking about?</p>
<h3>The Chinese Harmonica Community Has United as One</h3>
<p>— Dong Er</p>
<p>The main people held a meeting yesterday noon. A joint celebration will be held at the Geely Restaurant on the fourth of next month.</p>
<p>The organization of the Chinese harmonica community has always been very loose, but it has recently united. According to reliable news, at 12:30 noon yesterday, the leading figures of the harmonica community, Wang Qinglong (Zhonghua), Shi Renwang (Dazhong), Li Houxiang (Guangming), Yu Yuxing (Hualian), Chen Jianchen (Shanghai), and Bao Mingshan (China), held a meeting on the third floor of the Jinlong Hotel to discuss all matters related to unity. It is heard that at this meeting, it was decided to hold a "Joint Celebration of All Harmonica Teams in Shanghai" at the Geely Restaurant at 7:30 p.m. on February 4 (Saturday). In addition to the participation of more than 200 members of the above-mentioned teams, harmonica team members from other schools and groups are also welcome to participate voluntarily. (The fee is one and a half yuan per person.) Those who wish to join can register with Bao Mingshan at 1234 Fuxu Road from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day from now until the 28th of this month. At that time, in addition to dinner, there will also be various recreational activities and lucky draw prizes to increase interest. It is also heard that the second meeting will be convened by Wang Qinglong of the China Harmonica Association this Saturday to report on the progress and continue to discuss various matters.</p>
<h3>The Characteristics of "Sixty Years Behind the Curtain"</h3>
<p>— Sima Hua</p>
<p>The blockbuster "Sixty Years Behind the Curtain" shown by Guotai not only achieves unprecedented beauty in color photography, but also achieves unexpected success in the distribution of actors. The military and national affairs, as well as the love affairs of the children, of Queen Victoria during her sixty years on the throne, are all-encompassing, large and small. Director Wilcox handles these large and complex scenes with simple techniques and superb skills, making the audience feel organized and worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Although this film and "The Story of Queen Victoria" have the same protagonist and the same historical facts, "Sixty Years Behind the Curtain" is much greater and more magnificent than "The Story of Queen Victoria." Here are just a few of its characteristics:</p>
<p>When Queen Victoria married Prince Albert, members of parliament expressed their opposition, but the Queen's will was firm and she was unmoved. Anna Neagle's performance was very appropriate.</p>
<p>The grand ball at the Queen's wedding ceremony was solemn, magnificent, and antique.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria reviewed the troops on horseback, breaking the British tradition of reviewing troops in a carriage. Although the court ministers tried to stop her, the Queen turned a deaf ear. This scene is extremely flamboyant and beautiful.</p>
<p>The birth of Princess Victoria was celebrated with unprecedented enthusiasm throughout the country. Prince Albert hosted the opening of the Exhibition - the Crystal Palace, with its rare and wonderful displays, was a magnificent sight.</p>
<p>The grand ceremony of Princess Victoria's marriage to the Prussian Prince was magnificent and splendid, echoing Queen Victoria's own wedding ceremony, shining brightly one after the other.</p>
<p>General Gordon was besieged by Arab natives in "Khartoum." The general gave his life for his country, and his heroic situation was inspiring.</p>
<p>In 1897, the "Diamond Jubilee" commemorating Queen Victoria's sixty years on the throne was celebrated throughout the United Kingdom. The enthusiasm of the situation and the grandeur of the scenery are rare on the screen.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria passed away and the whole country mourned. The seriousness and tranquility of the atmosphere was a striking achievement of the director. Throughout the Queen's life, British science, art, literature, music, and medicine have made great progress. This film can clearly show the various achievements of Queen Victoria during her reign. Its greatness is just like Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>This film will be released soon, so I will extract its characteristics and tell the readers of the entertainment industry first.</p>
<p>Entertainment News The Minguang Club at 617 Cishu Building has been established for several months, but the number of members has been increasing day by day. The club aims to promote noble entertainment, so the members are all students from various universities who are purely studying Peking Opera, drama, and storytelling. It is now known that the club is scheduled to broadcast a special program of Peking Opera and storytelling at the Fuyin Broadcasting Station at 418 Hed Road from 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on the 18th of this month. There will be a grand event at that time. As for drama, it is currently being actively prepared, and it is heard that it will be staged soon.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Palace and Gardens of the Old Capital (7) (8)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The strange actor Wang Fushou always gets boos every time he performs.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the emperor and empress to the colleagues in the backstage, they both hate him and admire him. They hate him for his bad nature and admire him for knowing all the plays. In case the main actors have an emergency and cannot perform, he can fill in; he is like a play bag, like a large play test sitting there, and all the actors feel much bolder. The Empress Dowager also heard Lian Ying and others talk about this situation, so she gave him a small punishment of kneeling, which was also out of love for his ability. A few unscrupulous ghosts fabricated rumors for him, saying that he ran a mutton shop (i.e., a mutton shop). This spread slowly to the Empress Dowager's ears, because she was born in the year of the sheep, so she naturally wanted to avoid the matter of killing sheep. Wang Fushou had served in the inner court for so many years, and the reward he received was never more than one tael of silver. Later, he sighed that he had no Buddha's fate, and he did not compete with Zheng Tan and others, and was willing to be their supporting role, only seeking food and clothing to keep him warm, which was enough for him. However, in his later years, he often complained to his colleagues, saying: "No matter where we perform, we would rather teach the art after we get the money, don't let the money suppress the art. This way, we have a clear conscience, and the master has done this all his life, and never thought of competing with others for the top or second card. Besides this old man, there is also a master of painted faces, Mr. He Jiu (Gui Shan), who is also a first-class actor. Because he is addicted to alcohol, he asks to sing the first three scenes every time he enters the backstage. After singing the play, he takes the money and goes to a small restaurant (there is a kind of two-meat shop in Beiping, which is cheap and good, and is most popular among the general scholars.) He eats and drinks a lot, and never returns until he is drunk. It is said that the income of these two famous actors outside is only forty or fifty diao of Beijing money, which is less than two yuan in the current national currency. Like Sun Juxian, the most popular at the time, the outside string was never more than ten gold, compared to the current general famous actresses who want 30,000 or 50,000 yuan, which is three or five times more than the salary of our National Government Chairman Lin, which is a bit too much. I have never liked to add flowers to the brocade and make excessive compliments, so I wrote out what Hongyan Si said, so that these younger actors can also be a little humble.</p>
