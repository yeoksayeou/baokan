<h3>希特勒的演說</h3>
<p>希特勒可以當大演說家之稱而無媿！他昨日發表的演說，眞是値得一讀。讀了之後，誰也不能說他的和平呼籲·毫無誠意，他眞是不願意戰爭！因爲國社黨統治下的德國，雖經多年的整軍經武·預備遂其擴展大欲，而造成龐大的第三帝國：可是德國沒有像英法兩國那樣大的海外殖民地，軍需工業的原料大部分都需輸自外國，而她的庫藏也不像英法那樣充分；他眞是不宜戰爭，更不宜長期戰爭。就軍需工業原料方面講，德國需要自海外輸入百分之七十五的鐵砂，百分之八十的鎂，百分之九十的煤油及汽油，百分之九十五的銅，百分之九十的鉛，根本沒有鉻（克羅米），所以需要百分之百。德國原料中惟一可以自給的，祗有煤；但是事實上也有問題·第一因爲德國必須以此與其隣近中立國交換若干德國所缺乏的必需品，第二因爲德國工人常在怠工狀態之中，第三因爲德國缺少汽油，及橡皮等，於是不得不用化學方法，造出人造的汽油及人造橡皮·而煤即爲此項化合物的主要原料；因此種種，煤的產量雖多，銷耗也隨之加大。此外·德國主要的產煤區即是現在的西綫戰塲薩爾區·這產煤區一部分已爲法佔領，一部分已爲大砲轟毀，至少也爲大砲目標；總之，因爲西綫戰事而不能全部照常工作，全數照常供給。在她進佔波蘭後，雖一部分可取償於波蘭的煤礦，但是波蘭礦工爲德方掘煤，是怎樣的難於適應理想效率啊！至於煤油，德國平時即需每年消耗六百萬噸以上；到了戰時，據估計每年需消耗千五百萬至二千萬噸之多，人造汽油的產量雖每年可達兩百五十萬噸，然與實際需要仍相距太遠。這許多物質上的缺乏，都是德國誠心希望和平的因素。假使德國富有現金·也許不難避過了敵人的封鎖，向各中立國家購得所需；無奈這點又近乎畫餅充饑，據說在這决戰爭開始的時候，德國國內只有黃金準備六百萬鎊，國外只有外滙基金一千萬鎊：只此戔戔，怎夠戰爭浪費，何况長期戰爭</p>
<p>上述的數字·雖不是德國方面所發表的，故與眞實情形，容有出入，然諒也不致與事實相差太遠。總之，德國的物力資財遠不如西歐民主國家，那是不可掩諱的事實。英法政府一苒聲明其作戰到底的決心，必擊潰國社黨而後已，無論這種話有百分之幾的把握，或僅僅表示決心，但在前綫對壘，總是嚴重的事實，爲希特勒所無可吾認，無可躱避的！因此之故，在此戰勝波蘭之後，英法相繼表示決心作戰之餘，他並不完全以勝利英雄的氣燄，答復西綫敵人；而竭力發揮其爲大演說家的長處，雄辯滔滔，來補救物力資財的不足。</p>
<p>我們從旁觀察：旣衷誠祝望歐洲的及早和平，又同情於垂危的文化遺產與數百萬生靈，抑且承認希特勒呼籲和平的誠意，及其演說中所包涵的每一片段的眞理：倘若現在是德國與英法紛爭的初期，倘若現在是和戰的歧途，則只此一篇演說，也可希望宏效；但是不勝扼腕，現在不是德國與英法紛爭歷史的第一頁！質言之，若在和戰關頭，或可由此覓致和平，今在戰爭中途，殆難由此結束戰爭！</p>
<h3>希特勒發表演說　對英法提出最後和議　舉行國際會議討論總解決劃定國界　依人種恢復波蘭由德蘇保障其中立</h3>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首於今午十二時正發表演說、措詞甚爲和平、希氏建議用國際會議之方式、解決波蘭衝突引起之尖銳問題、以及國際間基本問題、如軍備·國際貿易·幣制事件·及國際安全等事、此决希氏演說共達二小時、最初之二十分鐘叙述德波戰役德軍之勝利、然後轉其談鋒、討論德蘇邦交與共同利益、據稱、此乃德國外交政策轉變之一要點、德蘇之友誼、證明德國並無奪取世界上優越地位之野心、亦無征服烏克蘭或烏拉爾區域之願望、外間對德國之訐擊、殊欠公允也、僅於討論完成修改凡爾賽和的問題稱、完成修改此的之最後階段、竟須流血、殊違德國初願、據稱、德國外交政策之宗旨、乃欲使德國與他國之關係明朗化、希氏又提及德國與波羅的海沿岸各國及丹麥簽訂互不侵犯公的、並鄭重聲明、德國對丹麥或比利時均無要求、德國與匈牙利及南斯拉夫之邊境不至改變、嗣又鄭重表示、德·荷·義·具有悠久的友誼、並重新保證德國在目前及將來對法國均無領土之要求、希氏更聲明德國政府致力與英國達到到諒解、並稱、迄今彼仍具有非完成此項諒解、不能達到世界和平之信念、然後希氏討論德國與英法關係之和平、據稱、彼願在世界人士之前、提出下列之問題、西歐何必發生戰爭、是吾作戰之目的、企圖恢復凡爾賽和的造成之波蘭、希氏認爲此種目的、並無達到之可能、然則西歐戰爭是吾欲毀滅德國、縱然此目的可以實現、五年之內、世界又將發生此類之問題矣、希氏討論解決東歐問題稱、德國之邊界將與歷史的及人種的需要相合、東歐全部少數民族問題、亦須予以解決、猶太問題之應予解決、亦論及之、希氏繼又提及重造波蘭國之問題、但不准該國採取反德之政策、對於造成歐洲安全之情緒、亦將予以考應、德國政府願說明其對國外之政治目的獲得殖民地、乃德國之最後要求、德國願從事合作縮减軍備、並主張廢除對婦孺之作戰情形、惟有恢復和平之後召集國際會議、解決所有上述之問題、始可具有意義、至於戰爭影響之所及、不僅參戰各國胥蒙其害、亦全世界之慘刧也、希氏於結束其演詞時、復保證以上所云、乃其最後之建議、並稱、好戰喜功者如予以拒絕、則彼不惜苦戰到底云（六日海通）希特勒謂德國當前亟切問題、爲樹立公正持久之德國疆界、調整東歐之秩序、調整該廣之猶太人問題、創立一波蘭國、而在該區不致發生危險、希氏繼乃臚舉德國要求五項如下、（一）依據人種及社會情形、適常解決德國之疆界、德國領土及歐洲東南部之各種民族、予以適當之調整、解決猶太人問題、重建各國商業關係、建立波蘭國、由德蘇担保其中立、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>希特勒歌頌戰功　醜訾波蘭自誤</h3>
<p>柏林　衆議院頃在克洛爾歌劇院開會時會塲之中、御棕色制服之國社黨員、曁返自波蘭前綫之戎裝軍官、觸目皆是、各國使節全體列席、全塲肅靜、與前此歷屆開會時滿塲高呼「萬歲」者、逈乎不同、正午十二時〇五分、希特勒元首款步人塲、就政府人員席决、全塲肅立致敬、旋由議長戈林上將宣佈開會、並發表簡單演詞、追悼陣亡將士、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首向議會發表演說時、曾檢討德軍在波蘭戰事中之成績、視爲「歷史上空前之勝利」、渠指稱、德軍於十八日以內所完成之戰績、在二十五年前、須十四月始能完成云、希特勒重視德軍作戰之人道性質、渠謂、「余禁止非絕對必要之犧牲」、就華沙之佔領言之、德軍之擊破華沙抵抗力、固毫無問題、德軍於九月二十五日至二十七日之戰績、原可於九月十日至十二日實現、但渠欲避免第一綫德軍之犧牲、並希望波蘭有表現責任心及常識之機會、故屢决延長華沙守軍獻城之期限，及平民撤退之限期、轟炸機及重砲隊、亦常接命令、僅轟擊各種軍事目標余建議不炸普拉格區、即係保留平民撤退之塲所、余兩决努力於外僑之撤退、經各種困難後始獲成功、德軍於九月二十五日開始進攻、華沙守軍即於二十七日投降、希特勒讚揚德軍步兵·坦克車·空軍·及潛水艇之成績、渠謂、「擁有三六〇〇〇〇〇〇人民之國家、其軍事力量、全部毀滅於四星期之內、而戰勝者未嘗遭過一次挫敗、此不能視爲幸運之恩惠、而爲訓練·領導·及勇敢之證明、」希特勒於此舉二例以證用之、（一）勃拉斯基威茲將軍率領一師、在雷希腦將軍所率一軍之左翼向華沙推進、當時以爲波蘭軍業已向維斯都拉河撤退、而突然爲波蘭軍所截擊、波蘭軍以步騎兵會攻德軍、德軍以疲憊之師、抵抗五六倍之强敵、英勇苦戰、以待援軍、波蘭軍廣播勝利消息之際、被圍德軍已向余報吿業已阻止波蘭軍之活動矣、（二）第二預備師奉命壓迫波蘭軍、使退往「走廊」北部、並佔據格蒂尼亞、向海拉半島推進、該師遭遇波蘭軍之精銳部隊之抵抗、卒於數日之內節節前進、俘獲波蘭士兵二〇〇〇人、佔領格蒂尼亞、波蘭軍殘部四、七〇〇人、被迫退柱海拉半島、常議員起立致敬之時、希氏宜佈德波戰役德軍傷亡之確數、據九月卅日之統計戰、軍官死亡者一萬零五百七十二人、傷者三萬零三百二十二人、失踪者三千四百零九人、繼稱、華沙及穆特德林之砲台與海拉半島均已乞降、波蘭之戰役事實上業已停止、戰爭之結果、波蘭軍隊完全擊潰、波蘭國家業已瓦解、六十九萬四千俘虜巳向柏林開拔、俘獲之勝利品尙難估計、</p>
<p>希氏嗣將歐戰後波蘭之建國與發展之歷史、作一詳細之叙述、據稱、一九一九年波蘭人謂所要求之土地內、波蘭人佔居民百分之九十五、其後公民投票之結果、證實其言之不確、例如東普魯士、波蘭人祗佔百分之二、</p>
<p>希氏叉提及非波蘭人所受之虐待、雖有一百五十萬日耳曼人被迫脫離其家庭、極需要之物件（如衣服）亦不准携帶、而德國仍與波蘭成立可以容忍之關係、不幸波蘭之當局竟發生誤會、認爲此乃荏弱之象徵、</p>
<p>希氏於叙述去春波蘭對但澤逐漸增加侵略後、彼仍企圖與波蘭政府成立協定、據稱、余會想及欲使波蘭政府易於接受吾人之建議、向其表示德國願保障波蘭之獨立、其情况與德國賦予斯洛伐克之保障相似、但波蘭加以拒絕、波蘭拒絕德國建議之原因有二、（一）波蘭懷抱佔領德國疆土之野心、企圖兼併東普魯士·波麥尼亞·及西萊集、不僅使波蘭疆界、推進至奧特河、且遠至易北河爲止、（二）波蘭取得英法兩國之保證後、雖未受任何威脅、亦悍然向德國挑釁、希冀實現其野心、</p>
<p>希特勒繼述波蘭對於日耳曼人之暴行、日耳曼村莊多處已成廢墟、居民横遭慘殺、尙有其他</p>
<h3>希特勒　不承認背棄信義　謂志在解除凡爾賽和約束缚</h3>
<p>柏林　希特勒曰、英法兩國當局一再發表言論、輒以不信任余之諾言爲詞、但余曾向德國民族提供諾言、必使彼等解脫凡爾賽和的之束縛、並恢復彼等生存攸關之各項權利、此項諾言、余已實踐之、外國政治家責余背信時、余所由表示抗議者、其故在此云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法反響不佳</h3>
<p>倫敦　德國元首希特勒頃在該國衆議院所發表之演說、由無綫電傳至此間之後、英國政界方面之反應甚爲簡明、咸謂此種演詞、並未包含何項新耍素、所謂和平攻勢、不如一般預料之甚、對於未來局勢、亦未提供何種保證、一般人殊不以爲異、要之、此項演詞「並無何項價値而巳」云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　德國元首希特勒在該國衆議院所發表之演說、傳至此開之後、法國負責人士第一反應、厥乃希特勒故技復萌換言之、即在每次引起新事變之後、　　重聲明不復有何要求、他國即亦不必有所疑　、　有若干細目尚待解決云云、渠之論據、不外「外波蘭而論、請聽余與蘇聯當局爲所欲爲、波羅的海沿岸各國旣已撥歸蘇聯、余無何項要求、余未對於波蘭作戰、而波蘭實爲侵略者、準是而論、宜傳已久之和平計畫、對於現行局勢甚少裨補、德國雖準備媾和、但該國凡所征略之地必須爲所欲爲、並按照該國利益以組織東南歐洲、如是而已、至希特勒所謂渠在歐洲方面不復有何領土野心、亦已耳熟能詳、當彼併呑捷克斯拉夫國之前、已在慕尼黑會議時、鄭重提供此種諾言、迨彼與蘇聯瓜分波蘭國之時、亦曾以此爲言、其對於未來局勢、又未提供何項諾言、此與英法兩國政府所提先決條件、不相符合、英法兩國於此亦惟記取其違反信義之所爲從而予以對付云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美大陸沿岸　設中立區</h3>
<p>華盛頓　英國駐美大使洛齊安頃已請美國務卿赫爾、說明汎美大會所劃中立區域之意義、某新聞記者後向赫爾詢問、此項宣布是吾含有任何恐嚇意義、赫爾答稱、美洲二十一共和國所議定者、不過爲任何交戰國如有不接受或不遵守其決定情事、則二十一共和國將互相商榷辦法而已云、按此中立區域從新大陸海岸起而至海上、有數處達六百哩之遙、在此區域內不許有敵對或交戰行爲、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　德國警吿美國、謂有人希圖在美國海濱附近炸沉美船「依羅瓜斯」號、此間聞之頗爲驚愕、但政府方面以爲此爲一種非常的宣傳策略、蓋德國揣想美國輿情對德方前傳美船「雅典尼亞」號乃由英艦擊沉、必已相信也、惟美人顯未信之、故華盛頓對於德國就已失信之基礎再作此種新宣傳、以冀有所獲益、頗以爲異、茲悉「依羅瓜斯」號所載乘客與海員、共五百八十四人、皆屬美人、，（六日路透電）</p>

<p>莫斯科　據主管方面宣稱、頃有英國輪船十二艘暨瑞典輪船五艘、裝運船貨赴英格蘭、被蘇聯當局在摩曼斯克港加以扣留、據稱、蘇聯採取此項措施、係根據九月九日外交人民委員會所頒法令、凡國家採取對蘇聯國際貿易不利之措施者、蘇聯當將運往該國之船貨加以扣留云、（六日海通電）</p>
<h3>美國人士　同情中國　推行一碗飯運動　集款救濟華難民</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社紐的航訊　中國難民救濟協會、前於去歲在美國各大城市發起一碗飯運動、募集捐款、成績至爲良好、茲又定於十月間再度進行此種運動、並由會長西沃度羅斯福（乃係故總統羅斯福之姪）發出懇切呼籲、申請全國各界人士竭誠贊助、其言略謂、「中國廣西省柳州城嘗於本年九月間被日本飛機二十七架肆意轟炸、死傷之人數以千計、其地竟無外科器具用以醫治受傷之人、中國平民現所遭遇之痛苦、於此可見一斑、若輩遭受天空恐怖之打擊、亟須獲有最低限度之救濟、全中國人民無家可歸者不下五千萬人之多、此在吾人拯溺解懸、實屬義不容辭」云、由此觀之、歐洲戰事雖在美國引起焦念、但中國難民救濟工作、並不因而感受影響、</p>

<h3>希特勒　演說全文　（績）　（接第四版）</h3>
<p>村莊之日耳曼婦孺亦遭虐待與屠殺、倘此項暴行之百分之一、發生於英國之敵對區域內、則英國紳士、必以虛僞之恐怖語調、加以痛斥矣、</p>
<p>希特勒繼稱、波蘭誤解德國之容忍爲軟弱、而以爲德國之讓步、表示可以繼續加以侵略、波蘭並誤解德國政府之責任心、及德國元首獲得諒解之決心云</p>
<p>德蘇協定</p>
<p>德蘇兩國簽訂條的之基礎、爲共同利益、不僅兩國有關問題相同、且兩國均承認有互相合作之必要也、史丹林旣不以蘇維埃主義爲與其他政治主義建立友好關係之障礙、則國社主義之德國、殊無理由採取不同之途徑、兩國互相尊重不同之主義與制度、不復有發生敵視態度之理由矣、德蘇互不侵犯條約為德國整個外交政策之轉變點、兩國不僅可以維持和平關係、且可永久合作矣、德國並不爭取世界霸權、亦不欲奪取烏拉爾·烏克蘭·羅馬尼亞·及其他土地、可以德蘇協定爲證明、德蘇兩國間不容發生糾紛、故劃定勢力範圍之界綫、各自維持其勢力範圍內之治安與秩序、同時避免損害他國之利益、德國在其勢力範團內之任務如下</p>
<p>（一）建立德國疆界、對於歷史·種族·經濟各項條件、均加以適當之考慮、</p>
<p>（二）綏靖工作、保證德國領土之安全、及德國勢力範圍之安全、</p>
<p>（三）最重耍者爲依據種族之需要、建立新秩序、使各民族獲得較爲合理之民族疆界、</p>
<p>希特勒稱、日耳曼民族散居東歐及東南歐、不易同化、必須採取遠大政策、建立歐洲新秩序、消除潛伏之摩擦、德蘇兩國業已商定、互援解決此項問題云、</p>
<p>土地要求</p>
<p>希特勒檢討德國與國聯之關係、以爲國聯乃保持凡爾賽條的之工具、渠謂「倘四千六百萬英國人、可以耍求統治四千萬方公里之土地、則八千二百萬德國人、要求八十萬方公里之土地、並要歸還殖民地、不應視爲不當也、德國之耍求、僅限於最緊耍之生存利益、倘德國人民之自然生存利益、並不感受直接威脅、余必勸告德國人民、放棄其要求、世界各國渴望和平、無有如德國之殷切者也、</p>
<p>各國關係</p>
<p>希氏至此　論德國與各鄰邦及列强之關係、分析討論如决、</p>
<p>（一）德國與波羅的海各國、締結互不侵犯條的、其利益純爲經濟性質、</p>
<p>（二）德國對北歐各國過去及今日均無絲毫爭執、德國會向瑞典挪戚提議簽訂互不侵犯條的、但該兩國認爲並未受威脅無須締結、</p>
<p>（三）德國對於丹麥並無宿怨、雖凡爾賽條的會將一部份德國領土、讓予丹麥、但其後德波即釋嫌修好、並曾簽訂互不侵犯條約、</p>
<p>（四）至於德荷邦交素稱輯睦、兩國之間、從無意見、</p>
<p>（五）德國對於比利時、自余秉政之後、即亟力敦睦邦交、余放棄對比利時之要求、甚而根本放棄要求之意念、</p>
<p>（六）對於南斯拉夫、自余歸併奥地利後、余即向之保證、認爲德南疆界、已屬最後疆界、德國　與南國、永保和平、</p>
<p>（七）德國對於瑞士、採取與對比利時完全相同之態度、對於兩國友善、決未加以懷疑、</p>
<p>（八）德匈兩國素有傳統之親善、德匈疆界亦將永永不變更、</p>
<p>（九）斯洛伐克獨立之時、自動要求德國贊助、德國對於該國獨立、加以承認、</p>
<p>（十）大國方面、先論德義邦交、力言德義疆界已經鄭重保證、決不變更、世界大戰時之仇敵、已變爲最親密之友邦、在主義及政治上、締結共守公約、而成歐</p>
<p>（十一）對於法德盡力消除惡劣空氣、希望造成雙方均可容忍之局面、因此對於亞爾薩斯·勞倫問題、絕口不提、任何法國政治家、決不能謂德國向法提出要求、</p>
<p>（十二）至於英德諒解、爲余畢生目的、雖至今日、余仍相信、必須英德關係改善、歐洲始有和平可言、根據此種信念、余決定採取和平談判之途徑、倘竟致失敗、則其責任幷不在我、希氏至此提出重大問題、追究西錢何以發生戰事之原因、</p>
<p>（一）其將爲恢復凡爾賽條的之波蘭乎、余今鄭重宣稱、凡爾賽政策決不能復活、德蘇兩强保陣此事、波蘭問題應完全由德蘇兩國決定、</p>
<p>（二）豈德國提出何種危及英帝國之利益乎、余斷然日不、對於英國、即對法國、亦絕未提出何種要求也、</p>
<p>當前問題</p>
<p>希氏繼稱、當前問題、不外兩種、一爲解決因波蘭瓦解所引起之問題、一爲消除危害各國政治經濟生存之國際困難、德國對於重建德蘇分界綫迤西區域之秩序、認爲必須做到下列六種步驟、</p>
<p>（一）造成德國歷史的地理的經濟的疆界、</p>
<p>（二）遵照民族原則、通盤改組生存攸關之空間、</p>
<p>（三）作調整猶太問題之企圖、</p>
<p>（四）改組經濟生活及增進運輸上便利、</p>
<p>（五）保隙該區域內之安全、</p>
<p>（六）建立境內無危害德蘇陰謀機德國對於調整整個歐局之目的厥有兩種、小而言之、對於歐洲動亂中心在政治上建立秩序、在經濟上加以改組、大而言之、整個歐洲必須先建立安全之情緒、爲達到此種目的起見、第一各國必須坦白說明其外交目標、德國之外交目標、一言以蔽之曰、「廢除凡爾賽條的、」捨此之外、別無所求、</p>
<p>至於殖民地問題、德國乃依公平原則及經濟常識、提出呼籲、非欲以武力作威脅也、第二爲達到調整整個世界和平之目標、必須發展國際貿易及交通、調整各國之出產、以適應實際之需要、改組市塲及通貨、俾貨物交換及自由貿易之障碍、可以逐漸移除、第三最重要者、厥爲絕對保陣和平、及建立國際間之安全情緒、其中以縮軍一項、最爲先決條件、余曾屢决在國會中、提出此項動向之提議、均遭拒絕、想係因余提出之故、余深信必須國際協定、規定合法與非法運用軍備之定義後、歐洲始能恢復安全之情緒、日內瓦議定書禁止（甲）殘殺傷兵、（乙）虐待俘虜、（丙）攻擊非戰鬥員、（丁）使用毒瓦斯、（戊）使用潛水艇、並規定違禁品之種類、誠以近代戰爭之方式、日益可怖，必須加以廢止、在波蘭戰事中、余努力限制空戰、僅轟炸軍事目標、而草擬有效之國際條例、必然可能、歐洲即可保持和平、經濟繁榮之基礎、亦可確立矣、余不信歐洲之負責政治家、有內心不欲其人民享受繁榮之幸福者、此項願望、必須歐洲各國决定合作、始能實現、爲民族之前途而努力者、應即以輔助此項合作爲目標、爲達到此項偉大之目標起見、歐洲各大國將來必有一日、會同起草解决辦法、使各國均有安全·平靜、與和平之感覺、然此項會議舉行以前、必須進行準備之工作、此項會議、亦決不能在大砲聲中舉行、西綫現狀之繼續、誠不可想像、每日犧牲之數額、必愈益增加、倘有一日、法國向薩爾白魯根進攻、而將其摧毀、則德國將毀減穆係霍斯、倘法軍進而攻擊弗里堡、則德軍將還擊斯里斯達、易言之、兩國砲隊、將益愈深入另一國、果爾如此、則國際間某種新聞記者必引爲有趣、飛機商及軍火商、必大獲利潤、然而人民苦矣受害者之慘、將不可言狀矣、將來德法兩國之間、雖有新疆、但絕非繁榮之城市、而必爲殘廢之荒坵矣、余所以作此論調、乃希望吾人民脫離戰爭之苦、倘不能說服邱吉爾及其隨從、則此乃余之最後申明、吾等惟有苦戰到底耳、</p>
<h3>美參院熱烈辯論　中立修正法案　史汀生向全國廣播　主張廢止軍火禁令</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統秘書歐萊今日答客問、謂參院似有投票贊成政府中立案之傾向、甚可滿意云、參院外交委員會民主黨委員華特喬治預料參院對於航業限制與九十天賒賬兩點、將考慮修正之、參院復開辯論時、共和黨聶氏與民主黨奥佛登皆發言反對軍火禁令之取銷、聶氏要求政府實施現款自運之法案、而不必取銷禁令、奥佛登稱、取銷禁令無異武裝干涉歐戰、民主黨舒威倫巴治則駁其說、謂政府中立案乃任何國家所曾施行最完全而有秩序之避免戰爭方法、國會苟不故意欲使美國加入歐戰、則其所可行之最好途徑、無過於通過目前之法案云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　參議院本日就外交委員會主席畢德曼所提出之中立法修正案賡續辯論、首由共和黨參議員孤立派健將杜培發表演說、猛烈反對廢止軍火禁運條款、主張將原案劃分爲二、一爲關於限制本國對各交戰國之商務者、一爲關於廢止軍火禁運條款者、然後分別提付表决、孤立派各議員對於此項主張咸予贊助、希冀利用此種易略、將第一案即關於「現金交策運輸自行負責」一項條款者予以通過、而將第二案即關於准許軍火運往各交戰國者予以吾決、此在政府派各議員則因原案劃分爲二之後、必須送還外交委員會審查、勢必遷延時日、决當竭力避免之、此外、共和黨參議員奈埃（亦爲孤立派領袖之一）雖贊成實施「現金交易運輸自行負責」辦法、但反對以廢止軍火禁運條款作爲交換條件、認爲此舉足以危及美國和平、民主黨參議員奥佛登亦提出同樣主張、當即由原提案人畢德曼予以辯駁、力言現行中立法並非中立的」、其性質利於各大陸國、而不利於海洋國、一也、其內容禁止軍火運往各交戰國、而不禁止棉花或其他各種貨品之用於戰爭者出口、二也、至此、民主黨參議昌舒威倫巴治起立、爲畢德曼案作辯護、，並在法理上提出一種新論據、其言有曰、一中立國因通過法律禁止軍火運往各交戰國之故、反易引起責任問題、緣各交戰國於發覺該中立國商人有違反此項法律情事之後、勢必向之提出抗議、甚至以遠反的束爲口實而向之作戰、亦屬可能、反之、該中立國倘依照國際公法行事、而不禁止軍火出口、則各交戰國即使頒佈「違禁品」淸單、亦無法指摘之爲違反中立、今反對派所慣用之口號、乃謂畢德曼案足使美國捲入戰爭漩渦、其實進一步研討之後、必知此說實難成立云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>金融　外滙過程平靜</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯　掛牌、俱無上落、英匯暗市、至為沉悶、　中國財政、近來迭有新建樹、金融甚為　固、經營者為避免失敗計已漸放棄操縱市面之手段、故所影　於匯市者、祇實際用途之供求、惟初因華商略有進胃、兼英行有利亦跟踪活動、故午前形勢即略帶軟、下午香港電塞、兼西商沙遜吐售、致市象一度回平、卒因滙豐有利等吃胃良好、致結果仍略帶軟、英金計四辦士四六八七五、美匯七元半收盤、至本月份因扒者較少、故較現貨遂稍軋攏、中途聞某華行曾來拋出十一月份美金、全天交易十分淸閒、</p>
<p>有利華商尚在結進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條及美銀價等均平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美對法俱平、對滬大二五、美對英回縮一分半、對滬未更、對法小八七五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士半、美匯七元五三一二五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃滙兌回縮之故、開後市况沉寂、毫無變幻、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後因華商前來扒結、且英行有利納胃頗佳、唯匯豐某行等供意尙殷、故形勢雖緊、尙稱不劇、計匯豐賣予有利華商現貨英金四辦士半及四六八七五、又某行吐予華商有利現貨美匯七元五三一二五及半元、時聞某華行賣予外行十一月份美匯七元四三七五、嗣後成交益少、是以過程更無上落、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士四六八七五、美匯七元半、比晨開英微緊〇三一二五、美亦略軟〇三一二五、</p>
<p>沙遜港方則有塞出</p>
<p>後市初因西商沙遜前來拋售、兼香港來電塞出計相繼賣予匯豐有利及某行現貨英金四辦士半、並現貨美匯七元五三一二五及五六二五、是以爲狀一度回平、入後因匯豐等吃胃仍佳、且賣風已息、故狀態復見帶軟、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士四六八七五、美匯七元半、本月份英金四辦士四三七五、美匯七元四三七五、十一月份英金四辦士四〇六二五、美匯七元三七五、結果比上日現貨英緊〇三一二五、美軟〇六二五、本月份則未分榮辱、</p>
<p>紐約英鎊較為疲弱路透社五日紐的電、今日紐的外匯市塲、英鎊較爲疲弱、據銀行家意見、此僅爲近日漲風穩定之反動、英倫銀行自九月初起、不願對美售出英鎊、但聞現擬售出，庶不使匯率高昂、其他歐幣價格參差、</p>
<p>香港匯市英平美緊</p>
<p>香港六日電、今日匯市晨開平穩、英匯不動、美匯現貨緊一八七五、爲甘五元二五、申匯升五元、爲三百卅元、十時四十分美匯現貨鬆○六二五、爲甘五元三一二五、十一時三十分平穩無變動、</p>
<p>天港滙價微見放長天津六日電、今日匯市晨開呆滯、、英滙現貨微鬆〇六二五、爲三便士六二五、美滙現貨放長一二五、爲六元一八七五、申匯不動、仍爲一百十九元、「聯鈔」暗盤賤一元、爲八十五元、</p>
<h3>謠諑平息　金價堅穩</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、終日毫無色彩、上落殊微、蓋以日來謠諑平息、且當日外匯變動頗窄、人心無足左右、買賣不若以前之繁盛、情勢由疲轉堅、晨開即退達四千零五十元、嗣因證券帮稍有吐出、繼以緩塞者如搶帽子性之交易、然絕未見有巨額出入、而其間某金號乘機吸進、但一度曾降至四千零四十元低盤、復因外匯帶軟、及香港帮略有吃胃、故結果回升至四千零六十元高峯、收盤較隔昨尙軋漲五元、中途起伏平凡、甚合一般範圍較小投機者之口味、全日交易祇七八百兩、實已回復金價未騰漲時之狹市矣、銀樓飾金終日無變、海關金亦平定、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開平疲、首由錢兌業賣予銀樓帮二十兩、價爲四千零五十元、較之前收做小五元、開後現金號吐予錢兌業三十兩、價續撳低五元、爲四千零四十五元、嗣後某金號與錢兌業拉提、立即回高五元、某金號進證券帮二十兩、價爲四千零五十元、後因證券帮仍有供意、兼現金號等吐售、復做小十元、現金號售予金號十兩、價爲四千零四十元、此後忽聞外匯帶軟、引起買風、一時售者觀望、價頓一跳十元、錢兌業進銀樓帮十兩、價爲四千零五十元、後因某錢兌業續來吸收、且某金號亦有吃胃、致續抬高十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、價爲四千零六十元、將近午刻、復稍回疲、某金號復吐予錢兌業二十兩、爲四千零五十五元、作午收價、午後初開疲落五元、銀樓帮進錢兌業二十兩、價爲四千零五十元、嗣後雖外匯略轉鬆硬、但某錢兌業吸胃頗佳、致市勢反吿步升、進同業及命號共百兩、價爲四千零五十五元及五十八元、入後聞外匯復稍帶軟、故續抬高二元、金號進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千零六十元、作晚收價、結果比上日軋漲五元、全天祇二十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出便照烚赤價高十元、收進須减小三十元光景、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金絕無變動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出因烚赤上落極微、故終日未更、大同行仍懸四百十元、新同行與上價相同、收進須减低二十元光景、</p>
<h3>英金鎊下降最巨</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、風平浪靜、僅英金鎊下落一元五角爲最巨、美金鎊亦降一元、菲列濱票則漲五分、日金票一度昂達一元四角、卒乃步退至一元三角八分、結果尙跌五厘、朝鮮票亦曾漲至」元二角零五厘、卒爲一元一角九分、軋過尙升二厘、其餘均無彎化、</p>
<h3>貼現拆息均定</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、每千元仍始終站於七十元左右、未有變動、錢業公會拆息、仍掛一角九分、早午兩市均同云、</p>
<h3>印銀再度猛跌　英美轉平</h3>
<p>五日倫教電、銀市投機家進出不一、市面平、收盤後仍平、並無大數交易、大條銀、近遠期均不振、紐約銀電、美現貨未更、又孟　銀電、印銀市况仍萎靡不振、現期貨續又猛跌一羅比「安那、成交單共計六十張、</p>
<h3>證券　買戶踴躍　內債蓬勃　外股交易亦大旺</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、趨勢愈見堅強、市價緩步上騰、毫無回風、人心看好、漸見一致、蓋自湘北戰事勝利、其成續遠過台兒莊之役、人氣極形鼓舞、影　甚鉅、加以寇　大使之赴渝、一般或以為與金融方面有關、於是買戶又見踴躍、允以　利始終吸收、除補空外、或已翻多、鴻大聊益等亦有相當吸收、賣出方面除同康永康茂泰等號外、餘均爲零星散戶獲利了結、甲種已衝出五十四元、乙種亦衝出四十七元關、趨勢當仍爲曲綫上騰、市價結果、續漲五角至八角半、成交總數的計七十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交紗布交易所股五十股、價為三十九元七角半、突又漲起一元云、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報吿云昨日股市、可稱一大旺日、　業股方面交易之巨、　所罕　、價格挺秀非凡、上海銀公司、揚子銀公司、國際信託公司與會德豐等股、漲風最烈、其他股票、雖非邁步前進、至少亦能保持原位、橡皮股亦較活潑、價格略有進步、但以整個市况作比、則祇能視爲畫中副景、而猶乏特殊醒目處也、</p>
<p>倫敦五日電、今日英商遠愛各公司股票掛牌行市、稍見上升、滙豐銀行香港註册股升一鎊、爲七十三鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股回升九便士、爲十六先令三便士、其餘不動、倫敦五日電、今日中國外債、仍開中法美金等四種、掛牌行市平穩、無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗各帮　採辦不旺　行市迂緩不挫</h3>
<p>紗市績告下挫、蓋以　需滯遲、華南方面、受統制匯兌影響、各帮無力採辦、因此交易、大見减縮、一般浮多、鑒於環境不良、脫卸之念、油然而生、　面籌碼益感鬆懈、市盤乃傾向下墮、惟一般實力充裕之輩、逢低落時復來搜維囤藏、故跌風尙屬迂緩、就市塲情况測之、當然不脫疲弱之境、非待實需起色、難有新姿勢發現也、目前比頂峰時已下低至一百二十元外云、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、同業相聚、大家袖手勿動、延遲至九時五十分、纔形開市、塲上喊賣者爲夥、開價一跌十元、二十支雙馬現貨價爲七百四十元、棧單價爲七百二十五元、中途再小回低三四元、但客銷依然不振、迨至收盤、有一部份略爲拖進、回升四五元、查半日成交統計八百五十五包、七日有紗十件運香港、五十五件運　國、行情二十支雙馬跌十一元、天女跌八元、雙地球跌七元、茲將各帮口買去額景分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　一二〇　同行　六五五</p>
<p>內地　五〇　甯波　二〇</p>
<p>廈門　一〇　統計　八五五</p>
<h3>本棉交易活躍</h3>
<p>本棉交易、又見起色、永安廠辦進華棉白包花、額量殊鉅、的計四五千包、價格亦見穩定、其他廠家、未曾發展、至於同業中之買賣、亦較上日爲活躍、蘇北來源雖未斷絕、然途中運輸、殊感困難、本日碼頭上利通州花一千三百七十二包、聞其品質較遜之貨、價廉三四元、鮮艷絲毛細纖之貨、仍不肯鬆、常陰沙花到一千〇四十包、七日有棉花二百九十五件運香港、茲將現棉售盤列左、</p>
<p>通州花　一五七·〇〇　永安廠進　三千五百包　鈔票送廠</p>
<p>常陰沙　一六二·〇〇　又　又　一·〇〇〇包　又　又</p>
<p>通州花　一四九·〇〇　同業中進　二〇〇包　又　棧交</p>
<p>又　一四七·〇〇　又又　四〇〇包　又　又</p>
<p>通州打包　一六二·〇〇　一六〇·〇〇　永安廠進　五〇〇包　又　送廠</p>
<p>北太倉　一五一·〇〇　同業中進　一〇〇包　又棧交</p>
<p>又　又　一五二·〇〇　又　又　一〇〇包　又　又</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來殊呈呆滯之狀、各方俱抱觀望態度、因之市上靜寂異常、廠方稍有美棉定貨進胃、惟爲數不大耳、日廠對於印棉又有進胃、俱爲即裝定貨、此項印棉在下月中旬可以運到、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初會因同業購買、棉價略漲數磅音、嗣後又因南方套賣頗烈、及紐奧綸絲帮之在市拋賣、市况即轉疲乏、結果市况殊為參差不齊、漲一磅音與跌二三磅音俱見、印度棉市、日來因英美匯兌轉堅、及歐洲政局較為　動、因之棉價步跌、昨日又跌　三羅比、埃及昨日漲起十磅音、利物浦跌落一便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　新米到貨日湧　售價繼績下跌</h3>
<p>粳米跌風仍熾、人心已虛、且各地新貨除常錫松江等區搬運問題尙有阻碍外、餘則均能自由運來、昨計抵埠者由車輪裝到蘇嘉等貨五六千包、及河下貨到三四艘、本鄕作客鮮有進取、故各客販再度猛甩、以求出路、然結果終乏政效、統市成交數僅四五千包、而各貨價格跌落自一二元至四五元之巨、如各破粳雖呈提高殺决、除新礱眞特貨因市上不多、欲者難得、猶屬高貴、其特常錫粳仍開四十一元至四十元外、中段者及蘇同崑等破悉祗開出卅五元半至卅五元、較貶二元左右、新粳爲卅一三元、楓涇百哥自初開三十元、收盤爲甘八九元、其跌價比較最烈、竟達三四五元、松江薄破、以乏貨已久、得開卅四五兀、羊尖高甘四元、决至甘三元、見貶二元、蘆尖則以來貨較少、且頗受店胃歡迎、依行情本可站住、然受各貨牽制、遂亦帶下元譜、開特別甘六元、中次甘五元半至甘五元、客尖價格最廉、若江北新尖僅開甘元零二角、次開十九元六七角、蕪湖高尖廿元零五角、决至十九元半、砶尖十八九元、變元亦小一元、陳者卅二三元、新貨三十元零五角至卅元、</p>
<p>另訊、客秈市績下跌、比之前市又小一元三四角、照目下客秈之價格低宜而論、市面本可站定、每天銷量亦比粳米爲旺、奈連日新　慘跌、先後已有十元之鉅、而日商復有暗塞、江北京蕪來源日有三五千包、市面遂難支持、昨機秈米最高祗甘元零五七角、决至十九元、砶米祇十八元三五角、糙米十七八元、</p>
<h3>粉市頽勢難挽　小麥到稀銷滯</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現交平淡、緣二號粉廠盤仍守七元原盤、不願與低價之回籠貨競銷、故廠粉早乏大量成交、近日本客實銷、一部份均注意購取棧單貨、昨開老車牌六元七角五六分、兵船牌祇售六元七角、日廠鳳凰牌粉祇售六元四五角、上午賣氣充盈、其頽勢一時難挽、統市成交的計三四萬包、聞後市客囤方面、以廠盤不低、尙圖擯守、故市面稍覺平穩、麵粉今日有九千五百包、運往香港、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易續鮮進展、到貨並不湧旺、執貨者以歐戰情勢難於和平、洋麥來源終屬難劃、大都上棧待價而沽、華廠與日廠稍有進取、囤戶亦稍問津、結果市面仍與前市相彷、統市售開管店·蘇州·無錫·崑山·丹陽·揚州等麥三千五百包、除福阜兩廠辦去二千包外、其餘悉由化學工業社等購去、</p>
<h3>雜糧　芝麻奧銷活動　黃豆提高殺次</h3>
<p>邇來雜糧市况、大同小異、行情尙無特殊變化、芝蔴粤帮動銷、目來源仍祇小票、是以市氣挽回不少、大局續處堅挺、昨除本街採取蕪湖白蔴十二包外、（價詳市價欄）、粤帮辦去丹陽白蔴一百包、及漢口蔴二百包、黃豆出口銷塲非高不取、致有低高殺低之勢、昨市做開太倉豆四百包、價自十三元一角至十二元八角牛、及江北豆七十五包、價爲十四元五角、豆子今日有四百六十包、另有芝蔴二百五十包、運往香港、另有豆餅二千塊運往　國、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價平庸</h3>
<p>昨糖市平定、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白本棧略小爲五十五元、外棧貨初爲五十四元八角、後仍到五十五元、轉口貨無變動、太古車白亦初平後緊、東棧B嘜五十八元八角至五十九元二角、西棧五十允元至五十九元半、其餘CW嘜等照退、H嘜車赤四十三元至四十三元二角、本綿白及一號冰俱持原價國糖呌價稍鬆、仍乏整批成交、不日興化號貨當有開出、市勢看軟、</p>
<h3>南北貨　南芡獻新</h3>
<p>南塘芡　、首批零星已有到申、以貨斷已久、頗覺佾俐、本街售過二百元、池芡陳貨仍售原價、市象均堅、</p>
<h3>絲茶　珍眉綠茶　洋莊動辦</h3>
<p>昨日綠茶市續活潑、針眉去路、異常鋒佾、珠茶亦吿缺乏、品質優良之珍眉、同孚寳隆怡和協和各行、進意均濃、行情堅漲十二三元、全市成交各項綠茶、共達一千八百餘箱、市盤除珍眉一項見漲外、其餘亦均穩定、各洋行對於購定之貨、均已積極打包裝載、聞下週共有八千餘箱裝出云、</p>
<p>茶葉今日有一百三十件、運往香港、又五十件運往西　、</p>
<h3>煤炭　熟煤漲後回跌</h3>
<p>熟煤行情、前月底曾隨煤球暗盤每噸一度曾喊高至八十元、旋因煤球回鬆、熟煤生意大受打擊、乃亦急轉直下、削低六元、小塊熟煤、每噸五十四元、每担一百市斤三元七角、同業客戶、不取送力、至於提揀大塊、照盤酌加、</p>
<h3>五金　運費昂貴　銅價略漲</h3>
<p>五金交易、因價格高昂、均不敢下手採辦、市况岑寂、唯人心因海外無來源、依然堅挺、就中銅類一項、其產地係美國與日本、均不受歐戰影響、故來源未絕、現貨亦多、然途中之運費昂貴、申市行情因亦提加、咋市如TC紫銅塊每担售二百五上元、十二號至二十二號紫銅皮每担售二百六十元、十六號紫銅絲每祖售二百六十元、四分至一寸黃銅條每担售　百三十元、十二號至二十號黃銅皮每祖開二百三十元云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　呢絨門市需要大增</h3>
<p>呢絨因日來秋凉、實銷旺動華服衣料、西裝套頭、男女大衣、鞋帽飾物均見盛銷、蓋門市出路大旺、需要異常熱閙也、拆貨帮出樣版店舖、逐日現批交易、均在二千元之上、棋盤街一帶專做淸水門莊者、現售多者有一千五六百元、少者亦在五六百元以上、</p>

<p>越界築路區域、日僞行動忽緊忽弛、昨日情形、父見和緩、自靜安寺沿海格路至徐家滙、係滬西極西之邊界地段、速日情形、未有變化、惟滬西極東之邊界地段、自膠州路至康腦脫路延平路一帶、日來接連發生暴徒刦槍事件、秩序驟見緊張、捕房方面之搜查工作、亦已由西向東轉移、終日派有大批探捕駐守衝要地帶、檢查行人車輛、分載探捕六名、並有裝甲汽車兩輛、往來巡邏、戒備甚爲嚴密、曹家渡（通稱五角塲）一帶、日憲兵及僞警之卡車、往來頻繁、並時有武裝僞警、列隊巡行、捕房方面之巡邏隊、仍照常工作、雙方在路上相値時、僅相互默視而已、在大西路憶定盤路、惇信路及哥倫比亞路三處之崗位上、華捕已改換印捕、與僞警仍保持對峙狀態、工部局總裁費利浦、昨晨接見記者、謂工部局以最大之容忍謀事件之解決、繼續談判、乃時日間事、至滬西警力、亦視往年增加、茲將各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>繼績談判終必舉行</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局總裁費利浦、今（六日）晨接見記者聲稱、工部局在界外馬路之權、不致自動讓步、工部局始終力求忍耐、俾免發生或將妨害局勢之任何意外事件、此乃顯見之事、費氏再度否認的一個月前渠在市中心區與「市長」傅筱庵會晤後、曾續與「大道」當局舉行任何會議或談判、惟稱、遲早必將判談、</p>
<p>滬西警力並不削弱</p>
<p>屆時雙方對於此事必有若千「相讓與獲得」現局顯非工部局所願有、故局方刻正試圖淸除困難、費氏闡明公共租界在界外馬路區之警務活動云、許多人相信界外馬路上巡捕人數已减少、眞實情况、適得其反、蓋目前此等區域中之警務力、其人數已較一九三七年戰前增加一倍、且自丸月一日起、此等區域中警務力已大增也云、</p>
<p>滬戰以前曾經談判</p>
<p>大陸報云、官塲方面昨（五日）吿記者稱、工部局對於滬西界外馬路各種問題、必將企圖努力解決之、查一九三七年工部局曾與上海市長兪鴻鈞對該區各種問題、行將獲得解決、旋因戰事而未竟、惟目前之「市府一、對於當時計劃、今不予接受、因是項計劃規定向臨界外馬路之住宅與商店、均由工部局徵收捐稅也、</p>
<p>一切舉措幕後有人</p>
<p>正式談判、今雖停頓、而表面上、由工部局總裁費利浦與「市長」傅筱庵進行磋商、惟費利浦之後、尙有其他官員、刻正嚴重考慮現局之各方面、而傅「市長」幕後、亦有其他官員、內大多爲日籍「顧問」與軍人、經「市長」而向工部局提出彼等之意見與要求、「市府」在日方授意下、其解決問題之法、乃派無效用之警務力駐界外馬路、</p>
<p>暫時容忍力求解決</p>
<p>然工部局並未採取此種侵犯手段之舉動、工部局在該區之權力、固決不讓步、惟目前決計容忍此種侵犯行動、縱因租界巡捕與「大道」警察値崗向一地點、而發相反指揮交通號、致秩序紊亂、今亦暫予容忍、現况旣如此、工部局唯有儘其所能繼續行事、而竭全力、俾於可能的最短時間、獲得解決耳、</p>
<p>西童學校未遭侵佔</p>
<p>愚園路工部局西童學校、三日會有僞警侵入校內操塲、致使學童家屬、甚爲恐慌、記者前日詢之工部局總裁兼總辦費利浦、據　、對此事正密切注意、惟昨日工部局敎育處處長海萊向記者稱、僞警並未侵入愚園路工部局西童女學、亦未侵入其他工部局學校之內、</p>
<h3>偽警誤拘英人　道歉了事</h3>
<p>英人華特J.Ward、爲著名運動家、供職路透社、突於五日晚九時許、被滬西僞警强押離其靜安寺路一九八四弄二十三號寓所、赴極司斐而路、並將其所備無綫電機打字機一併取去、所有經過情形、已首誌昨日本報、嗣悉此案發生後、捕房據報、當由的克。山森·兩氏馳赴該處及日憲兵部以嚴正態度提出交涉、一面復由阿煦摩少校率英兵一隊、並偕代理總巡史密斯等往晤日軍少佐、日方嗣乃表示出於誤拘、當於昨（六）晨零時十五分、始將華特氏釋出、並將取去物件交還、據昨日消息、華特氏釋出不久、即得「大道警察之道歉、</p>
<h3>滬市西南郊　情勢日趨緊張　青松兩縣交界華軍待機　大隊進迫平湖聲勢甚壮</h3>
<p>上海四郊連日形勢頗顯緊張、傳因潛伏近郊各縣之游擊隊、將於雙十節國慶紀念日前後、有所示威動作、相機進擊日軍防區、故日軍方面從事惶戒備、「大道警察」亦自即日起、由上級下「令」無故不得請假、集合各「署所」內凖備隨時徵派、聞日軍最注重者、爲本市西南郊之一部、因該處靑松交界間數目不明之華軍、有襲撆上海市區之可能性故也、現市郊各區平民出入、盤查愈緊、任何人不得隨身忘帶似護身符之「市民通行證」、吾則即遇不可思議之危險、</p>
<p>滬西槍聲</p>
<p>本市滬西居民、於前晚深夜、聞有淸晰之機關槍聲、即係居法租界西區市民、於昨上午三時許、亦聞有槍聲、在深夜之時、此種槍聲、從何方而來、堪資推究、據滬西鄕民云、邇來華正規軍開至沿蘇滬段鐵路錢、駐守鐵路之日軍、日來戒備頗嚴、此項槍聲、似　日軍示威射放、</p>

<p>縣踏被俘</p>
<p>上海平湖間之水道交』通、因華正規軍密集於新埭一帶、嚴阻用丸字立名之輪船行駛、故迄難恢復、上海赴平之輪船、僅止於洙涇、洙涇以上、賴木質民船載客運貨、茲據航業界傳出消息、平湖縣長某、因微服親自巡查民間疾苦、被奸徒走風、遭日軍一隊包圍於某村、擬將該村房屋人民、盡付一炬、縣長視死如歸、挺身而出、以致被俘、但房屋與鄕民等得保全、嗣經華軍得悉、已派大隊向平湖縣城進迫營救、</p>
<h3>分幣券不敷流通　再印五十萬元　中央總行已與永甯公司接洽　烟兌業公會勸告勿囤積圖利</h3>
<p>中央銀行分幣券發行後、市上流行、依然並未普遍、故電車汽車暨先施大新新新等各公司之代價券、卒因實際需耍爲市面上認爲唯一代替之錢碼、此種情形、將演至何時、誠一疑問、查中央分行現在發出之分幣數量、本不敷供應市面上所需、又持有分幣券者、反爲好奇性所驅使、將其貯藏、而不使用市上、此種現狀、若無法打破、則上海分幣代幣之複雜與糾紛、勢必難於解決、</p>

<h3>救濟苦難華人　本市各大商店　舉行大義賣　市場設海格路英國女學日期今日下午二時半起收入充仁濟友助會經費</h3>
<p>今日（十月七日）下午一一時半，在海格路四百二十五號英國女學堂內，有濟助貧病的大義賣；所得盈餘，概充仁濟醫院婦女友助會經費。</p>
<p>凡是在去年十月十五日參與該會第一决義賣會的，一定尙能憶及當時的熱鬧情况。據說那决收入所得，共爲華幣三千餘元。其中一千餘元，業已救濟門診病人；而其餘三分之二，則用以購備住院病人的手工材料，酬報該會專聘的社會工作人員。</p>
<p>本市先施，永安，新新，大新等百貨公司，以及永安紗廠，大來飯店，凱士令西菜社，沙利文糖菓公司等，因該會成績優異，良意可佩，故而特地招助多量的四點，糖菓，玩具，食物，衣料，以便陳列於慈善市塲，聽憑各界士女任意選購。至於會員及病人的手工製品，亦將拿到市塲義賣。所以，慈悲爲懷的先生太太小姐們，應該帶自己的子女弟妹，到那邊去溜一圈。如果溜得累了，還可以坐下來進茶點，聽聽英國按察使莫薩伯夫人（Lady　Missup）的演講。好在那邊東西甚多，不妨慢慢的儘量挑選。回家時，包你『滿載而歸』，而且心中還充滿欣喜的情緒，因爲，『爲善至樂』也</p>
<p>仁濟醫院婦女友助會，成立迄今僅二年餘。說到該會成立經過，倒有一段値得叙述的歷史。回憶近郊砲聲四起時，接連發生過兩决慘劇：一决在大世界門口，一次在南京路鬧市中。當時本市醫院，實在容納不了那麽多的受傷人民。然而，醫院終究還是醫，不能像戲院那樣的，掛出『今日客滿，明日請早』的牌子來；所以祇得來者不拒，一律收容。然欲使『來者』躺病床，享受一般病人的普通待遇，在事實上亦不可能；故其悲慘情形，實非筆墨所能形容。此時有英僑婦女多人，不的而同的前往仁濟，分担志願救護工作，並且本着人道，正義，同情的精神，盡力濟助苦難華人。後來她們因着志同道合的緣故，就正式組設友助會。於是服務範圍日趨擴大，工作效力益見增高，而團體力量亦逐漸顯露。</p>
<p>最初成立時，會員盡屬西僑。後來中國女性，因行善不敢後人，亦相繼踴躍參加。這樣一來，工作進行更爲順利；而工作人員與病人之間，更不致發生言語困難。迨至華軍西撤，上海立卽成爲『孤島』；但該會仍本服務社會初衷，繼續解救別人苦難。她們都知道：病人所需求的，並非僅爲醫樂治療；此外如同情與瞭解，也很需要。</p>
<p>這般具有菩薩心腸的『人間觀音』——友助會會員——不但個個白盡義務，而且還得掏自己腰包。現在不說別的，就是以會費一項而言，一年也得化五塊錢。不過，若要多多出力，那末繳付一元也就够啦；因爲『錢出錢，有力出力」的原則，在這裏一樣通用。該會會務，在會長劉吳卓生女士，副會長倪老太太與　德夫人（Mrs.　F.W.Poate）主持之下，頗有長足的進少。提起劉會長，知道的人一定不少，而曾經受其敎誨的學生，當能憶及其循循善誘之風。至於其他負責人員，的如下述：</p>
<p>工作療病委員會主席麥克斯德夫人（Mrs.H.Maxted）。英文書記尹女士（Mrs.Bernard　Read）。中書記張泳泉夫人。司庫侯祥川夫人。圖書館委會員王信恩女士。保幼委員會主席陳晶菱女士，潘老太太。服裝布件委員會主席徐老太太，副主席麥李奈夫人（Mrs.W.M.McLennan），福格生夫人（Mrs.P.Farqubatson）。慰訪委員會主席安得烈夫人（Mrs.G.Fubdkay　Andrew）。兒童玩具委員會主席司篤克夫人Mrs.H.G.Stock）西文宣傳員亞德蘭女士（MissE.Adiam）中文宣傳王佩珍女士。醫院代表護土長載蘿女士Miss　Tayler）。會員代表鄭盛祖新女士（滬江大學女院主任）。</p>
<p>讀了上表，卽可明白該會工作大要。不過在這裏，似乎仍應略加解說。譬如像『工作療病』這個詞兒，在中國還很新。牠的目的很簡單，無非使病人在療餐期內，免除生活單調的痛苦；至於在病愈以後，獲得輕便手工的代價，以貼補日常生活費用，則猶其餘事。又該會圖書委員會所備的書籍雜誌全賴各界人士樂意捐助。病人借來閱讀，旣可消閒解悶，又可增進知識，得益自屬匪淺。兒童玩具及服裝布件兩委員會，專事勸募破衣舊服及洋娃娃等物；然後再加以綴補修理，而分送給病人。保幼委員會除請人認養嬰孩外，並兼理保護出院婦孺的事務。</p>
<p>却說從前，有個婢女模樣的未成年女子，經主母陪人醫院留產。產下的孩子，不久就吿夭折，而這個『可憐的秋香』隨後就回返主人衆中。那家老爺便是强姦了她而使她懷孕的人。所以太太對她，不免有點醋意；現在見其回來，自然視同眼中之釘，而時時橫加虐待。某晚，正當西北風括得甚緊的時候，竟把她用烈酒灌醉了，推逐至牆外的黑暗街道中，預備讓她活活的凍死。那時她的年紀，不過十三歲牛。</p>
<p>但是那顆受摧殘的心靈，尙能憶及『仁濟』二字。因爲她祇在『仁濟』，受過人家的安慰，憐惜。她在半麻木的狀態中，糢糢糊糊的吐出『仁濟，仁濟』的聲音來。途人聞聲見狀，不免動了惻隱之心，而將她帶到所說的地方。到了那邊，漸漸淸醒過來，知道不再有人會打她，駡她，而那個主人的家，也不能再回去了。所以就將事實眞相，一一吐露。事後，由友助會方面，將她送入『希望之門』——濟良所，與一般脫出火坑的女子，同受敎養保護；並由捕房當局，向老爺太太提起公訴。結果，由法院處主母以應得之罪刑，並判處主人監禁十八個月，諸如此類的事情，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>此種社會服務工作，是値得提倡而推行的；而明天的義賣會，也「値得」看一看，買一點。現在各位籌備人員，正在「大動腦筋；」準備讓塲中的大人小孩，個個笑逐顏開。怎見得？有　備委員的工作人分配表為證。表如下：</p>
<p>（一）彩票，病人手工　品，——麥克斯德夫人（Mrs.Maxted）。（二）表演，糖菓——弗萊特立克夫人（Mrs.Frederick）。（三）茶點——楊夫人（Mrs.Yonng）。（四）兒童用品——貝儂夫人（Nrs.Beynon）·（五）中國物品——黃振球夫人·（六）家庭用品——寳德夫人（Mrs.Poate）。（七）「釣魚」游戲——高羅夫斯基夫人（Mrs.Gorlovsky）。（八）家庭手製品（如花生醬，菓子醬等等）尹女士（Mrs.Read）·</p>

<h3>得不償失</h3>
<p>— 培初</p>
<p>歐洲各國，向歐洲以外各洲較爲落後的各處，奪取殖民地，因此滿載而歸，恣意享用，這樣的時代是過去了，再也不會重現了。理由有二：一，有些落後的國家，已在發奮爲雄，力求進步，使別國不敢輕於侵犯牠；一，可以分割的土地，已經分割完，各有所屬，再也沒有剩餘的，可以供給任何暴發戶染指了。這種時勢推移所造成的結果，不是出於一朝一夕的突然舉動，因此，要想改變這個現狀，也就不是一朝一夕的暴力所得而奏效。</p>
<p>有些暴發戶，偏不相信這個道理，偏要照抄從前列强的老文章，帝國主義的方式，來興風作浪，東掠西刦，其結果，若不是一無所得，也就是得不償失，比了一無所得還要壞，而大有所失。日本是個「始作俑者」，首先侵略中國，到現在陷在泥淖中，不能自拔，只要中國抗戰下去，其結果是可想而知的。意大利的侵略阿比西尼亞，勞師動衆，費了不知多少氣力，所得不過是一片石田，而這石田之上，還正在生出蒺藜來，使他們不能有一日的安居，迫得不得不有向阿皇賽拉西借重的企圖。最後就是德國了，也就是現在衆目所注視的德國了，牠消滅捷克，波蘭，究竟得到了些什麽呢？</p>
<p>自從民族主義代替了國家主義以後，誰都知道，任何强國，再也不能消滅任何有個性的弱小民族了。捷克波蘭旣能複國於先，自然也能復國於後的。所以德國目前的得，終要成爲將來的失。並且以目前而論，即使說捷克波蘭，允其最近的波蘭，能够暫爲德國所得，而德國所失的，却也遠過其所得。這不是德國的軍力或物力的損失，也不是人力的損失，乃是人心的損失，一種最大而無從補償的損失！這是什麼呢？那就是納粹的人民，從此可以目由吸收共產思想，以那樣最適於共產發展的德國，一等工業國，而又極端貧乏的窮國而論，納粹政府的傾覆是必然的，而且是迅速的。</p>
<p>德國，正和意大利與日本一樣，難道不曉得這樣的後果麼？爲什麼還要做這種旣然得不償失而且大有所失的勾常呢？要說牠們笨，自然牠們不肯承認，然而要說牠們錯誤，即使牠們不承認，也總是確切不移的事實。牠們於貪得的一念以外，又加上了一些虛榮心，所以現在要有這種進退維谷的局面，而將來要落到不堪的下塲。所謂虛榮心者，就是自以爲是一等强國，不能不有廣大的領土，不能不獲得一些殖民地，來裝裝自己的門面。這說穿了簡直是可笑的，然而牠們却正就在那樣的死要面子！</p>
<p>道些國家的統治階級，爲了怕自己的沒落，不能再統治下去，不得不向外發展，以便維持自己的地位，所以只好用種種的口實，對外侵略，這也是很對的理由。然而計算其侵略會逐漸成功，而其自己地位的維持，却也還須逐漸努力；侵略的成功有止境，而地位的維持無止境，將來牠們還是一個覆亡，得不償失，不，大有所失！原來牠們的統治方式，法西主義，根木是錯誤的，無可救藥的。我們看吧，一切現形的把戲就要來了呢！</p>
<h3>從北「京」來</h3>
<p>— 年兄</p>
<p>朋友從北「京」來了，陪他鑑賞了一下上海的繫華以後，天已經是傍晚的光景，於是決議「餵腦袋」去。南方菜他怕吃不慣，特地找了家天津館。一進門，耳邊便響起了怪熟識的天津話。</p>
<p>「吃麼？您啦。」又是那副職業的笑容。</p>
<p>我們隨便點了幾個菜，當然也要喝點酒。「麼酒？您啦，加皮？白乾？……」</p>
<p>一杯白乾喝光了以後，朋友的臉上，添了色彩，話自然也更加多起來了。</p>
<p>「老韓，給我講點『京』褁故事吧！」我終於把一整天沒得空暇談起的要求提出來了。</p>
<p>朋友皺了下眉頭；靜悄悄的吃了兩口菜，板着紅臉像是在沉思。突然，沒頭沒腦的開了腔：「如今北『京』街上可沒有失業的人了！」</p>
<p>我專心的聽着。一面喝酒吃菜，用點頭仰頭等姿勢表示領悟和發問，現在我就懷疑的仰了仰頭，臉上擺下一個大「？」號。</p>
<p>「你要知道爲什麽嗎？因爲——因爲沒有職業的人，不准留在北『京』啊！</p>
<p>「無業游民裏面，難免有些『不良份子』，通常總不能像有業『市民』那麽安分，市民中沒有了無業游民，天下豈不太平了嗎！所以在北『京』人人要有職業——我當然也有我的職業，我是一家相熟的店家的名譽管賬員。</p>
<p>「但是，這一來可難壞了那些在北平「養病」的大學生了，到什麽地方去找職業呢？————不過大學生到底受過高等敎育，臨時能打主意，凑了幾個錢，便開起咖啡州館來。錢費得有限，職業却找成了。趕巧還能賺一筆呢。所以現在幾家大學的門口，咖啡店很開了一些。店裹，裝璜都相當的漂亮，有女招待。生意當然還興隆，顧客大部份都是大學生。——黑咖啡，紅嘴唇，色調分明，大概這也就是所謂刺激吧？</p>
<p>「據說有一家開在××門口的，本錢是一千元，幾個月之後，已經賺到兩千多了，希望這店的主人過去是學的經濟，不然，他所受到的敎育——……」</p>
<p>朋友像深深地感動着，又慢慢的呷了口酒，臉上的色彩也更加重了。看他樣子像是想嘆氣，我連忙搶先來了聲：「唉！——」</p>
<p>「前些日子，你不是會給我一連寫了幾封信嗎？」</p>
<p>我點了點頭。</p>
<p>「嚇，那可眞給我送來一宗麻煩，我被憲兵請了去。問我信是怎樣的人寫來的，我當然只有說實話：『一個學生。』叉問我『他是你的什麼人？』我說：『表弟。今年十多歲，念初中。』怕你給闖下什麼禍，我又結結巴巴的添了這麼兩句：『小孩子，麼事也不懂。』」</p>
<p>我作了個鬼臉，吐了吐舌頭。</p>
<p>訊問我的，當然也是自已同胞。也許是看我窘得可憐吧，他說：『好了，沒有事了。——不過以後信頂好少寫。』接着怪親切的壓低了嗓子說停了一會，朋友換了調子：</p>
<p>「北『京』的事，想起來簡直像「團麻。我不高興多費腦子，還是告訴你一點這次路上的情形吧。</p>
<p>「有資格留在北『京』的人，要想離開也不是件容易事，要費不少的周折，扌能領到那張『出境證」。路上每到一個地方又總雞免一番盤問，我的出境證是託熟人去領的，花了點錢，所以只不過等了幾天的工夫。」</p>
<p>「天津的大水沒有時間去詳細硏究，在那裹，我沒見着遭難的人，只看到幾對男女坐着小船拍照像。」說到這裹他快活得笑了；我也快活得笑了，事情確實很好笑，我們笑得有道理。</p>
<p>笑够了，談話便又繼續下去：</p>
<p>「我到烟台的時候，烟台街上正在忙着拉夫。拉法很別致：把路的兩端堵起來，於是這條路上的行人，便全體給捉了去。帶到司令部。假如有店家來保，或者還有放出去的希望：不然那麽你就安心的住在那裏吧，等凑足了一個整數，據說便要裝船運走了——我酒不喝了。閒話少說，咱們吃飯</p>
<p>菜已經光了，酒也不多了：確實也應該吃飯了。於是我喊：「喂——！」</p>
<p>朋友在吃茶，我一時也想不起什麽旁的可以說的話，也許是酒喝得多了，頭有點發沉，偶而聽到隔座飄來的幾個零星字眼，很漂亮的北平話，然而却有點刺耳：</p>
<p>「……羊肉……涮羊肉……幾時再回去涮羊肉……一</p>
<h3>亂彈</h3>
<p>— 雲天</p>
<p>理論與實踐不可分離，文章和行動不能衝突——生活不論公私都得够「格」，格是一種水準，得到不難，文章上會得提到；然而並不因此更看重漂亮的文章（雖然或許已盡實踐之能事），倒在於幹。文章好，自己可以藏之名山，而人格壞，人家會把你傳之後世。釋迦牟尼並不用文章來感動人，現在還不損於他底偉大；嚴嵩好吟山林的詩句，至今人們還領悟他更險恕。要是這些故事你以爲都是在書中抄襲得之，而發出一聲冷笑，那也算了！</p>
<p>藝術之神聽到爵士音樂與砲聲的交響奏而痛哭了，她已聞到腐臭的尸氣。有閒者的文化過去未嘗沒有進步性，現在却退到火邊了。但讓它燒罷，燒個爽快，方不有負於苦惱的普洛米修斯。</p>
<p>以後腐臭的尸氣就沒了。</p>
<p>有人說。「舞塲　『蓬拆蓬拆』的怪昔，最曼妙不過。它相同於莊子用馬鞭敲着髑髏的　槖，嘻！」</p>
<p>這人自然是文士，飄飄然得很。但可惜莊子祇是哲學家，而不是再造家，雖然髑髏會立直起來把「死的勝利」的哲學發表一通。</p>
<p>但髑髏似乎也有存在的理由，吾則莊子將曳尾而出洋了。哈哈，棄棄，槖槖！</p>
<p>一個文化戰士有他優良的傳統——有勇敢，有氣節；但不必矯情故作直率，因爲後者會使本身不利。築就良好的「工事」，才不致給看出致命的所在。聽見可惡的哈哈就皺眉，這是不够。但决不把本質昇華了去。如果像李白在人家面前，詔諛開元之治爲」陶沙取金，剖石採玉，皆自得其精粹者」，祇會使自己臉紅，那是帮閒底無可奈何的事，雖然在李白這個人說來，還可以原諒一些。</p>
<p>淺淺地說來：我們所做的，「最後」還是不呌壞蛋稱讚，引爲同志，然而也不用死在他們的手裹。</p>
<h3>歸途</h3>
<p>澄潭淺渚畔的展痕，</p>
<p>更加印上了層層巒峯。</p>
<p>水流凄訴着無限歸思，</p>
<p>更望不斷北闕的烟雲。</p>
<p>秋風蕭蕭地奏起高調，</p>
<p>蘆葦飄着滿頭白髮，</p>
<p>長空雁唳，依稀還是舊時相識；</p>
<p>只當初是倉皇同路，</p>
<p>今日在笑意相迎。</p>
<p>驚起荒村犬吠，</p>
<p>也聽熟了自己的步音。</p>
<p>沉重地，肩頭擦起水泡</p>
<p>芒鞋踏破了一雙又一雙。</p>
<p>劃一支火柴，</p>
<p>嗞嗞地吮着絮黑的早烟桿；</p>
<p>凝着厚脂的白銅頭裏，</p>
<p>明暗地揚起紅色火光。</p>
<p>讓思慮昇華，</p>
<p>跟着口角邊嬝起靑烟縷縷；</p>
<p>蓬草下的柴扉半啟，</p>
<p>那兒是迷着老花眼遙望着的親娘。</p>

<h3>電影的生日</h3>
<p>— 裴裴</p>
<p>電影史話昨天（十月六日）是電影第四十五週年的誕生紀念日。</p>
<p>誰都知道電影是產生於科學家的實騐室，而在資本家的會計室裏養育大的。從它的誕生到現在，雖然還只四十五個年頭；但是，它的懷孕期却是很長的，大的在一百年前就已受孕着了。</p>
<p>一八三三年，即十九世紀的三十年代，它是以一種玩具的樣式而出現於市塲。最先流行於英國，在十年後的一八四五年扌慢慢的傳到美國來，這種玩具就是呌做「活動畫筒」（Wbeel　of　Life）。</p>
<p>話說「活動畫筒」道種玩具，運到美國以後，却使美國人着了魔似的，誰都對它起了興味，因此引起一般科學者對於它的硏究。那結果，就是「摩托觀察機（Motorscope，「放映擴大機」（Vitascope），以及「旋轉畫筒」（Zoatrope）這幾種仿製品出現。</p>
<p>根據了這些幼稚的機械的改良和試騐，塞勒（Sellers）扌於一八六一年的二月五日發明了一種「自動觀察機」（Kinematoscop）。這是「電影的祖母」。</p>
<p>一八九三年五月十四日，愛迪生（Thomas　A.Edison）發明的「活動電影觀察機（Kinetoscope），這扌是眞正被視爲「電影之母」的因爲它更接近於現代的電影機械</p>
<p>正當愛迪生發明「活動電影觀察機」的時代，恰巧是支加哥舉行着「萬國博覽會」，人們對於大科學家愛氏的發明，都帶着驚異的目光注視着。</p>
<p>從支加哥重返美國後，愛迪生乘便往他的故鄕去住了一些日子，叉回到他們研究着發明電影的　騐所里來了。</p>
<p>一八九四年十月六日的淸晨，愛迪生剛走進實騐所里面，他就得到一個驚人的報吿，這報吿不僅使愛迪生喜悅，就是全實騐所里的人們聽了也都快意的。因爲這報吿的結果：就是影子活動的試騐成功着了</p>
<p>是晚，愛迪生興奮地召集了近所的鄰人，事前沒有和他們說明要他們來的厚意，招待他們進了第五室後，就在白布上映起電影來，那是一段一個呌安娜裴爾姑娘底舞姿。在座的人們見了安娜裴爾姑娘的舞姿會在白布上活動，大家都驚喜萬分。這樣，一八九四年十月六日，就被他們規定爲「電影的生日」。</p>

<h3>錦繡山河　（績）</h3>
<p>— 企業</p>
<p>“Juarez”</p>
<p>導演者對於這部歷史巨片的處理，他在勾劃華雷士和馬克思米林這二個人物，非常精細週到。如華雷士的出塲拍背影，及所有華雷士出塲的畫面都給予觀衆一種嚴肅的感覺，這是表示他對於這位歷史上的偉人的尊敬。至於馬克思米林，他赴墨西哥時候，以幾個簡單的畫面吿訴他墨西哥的錦繡山河是遭受了侵略者的蹂躪，而華雷士的一封信，指明他的受人利用，以後在巴倫將軍的　　下，使他感到傀　的悲哀，導演者在這方面的描寫，細膩之至。</p>
<p>華雷士隻身往見烏迪南，及最後勝利馬克思米林的伏法的兩個高潮，都緊張而動人。（一）華雷士的馬車；守望報告；民衆追隨馬車而來；華雷士在排槍中間迎面走來；烏迪南喝酒後站出來，……他把正義和叛逆的人物分劃得非常淸楚，而情緒氣氛也見强固。（二）馬克思米林被捕後，各國大使環請特赦，華雷士拒絕了。在獄中，導演者以馬的黑影和鐘擺的聲音化到華雷士衷心的苦痛，及馬克思米林死後，華雷士在他遺體面前說：「請恕我！」用退鏡頭跟着到劇終充滿了濃馥的悲凉氣氛。</p>
<p>總之，「錦繡山河」中的人物彷彿都是在我們面前跳躍着的，而演員演技之優秀及技術上的成功，都是値得向全滬觀衆推薦的一部巨片。（完）</p>

<h3>愛情</h3>
<p>— 小田</p>
<p>甲說·若要找愛情的伴侶，應當到舞場　去　。</p>
<p>乙說·若是舞場　找得到愛情的伴侶，那末交易所　也找得到淸凈寂滅的菩薩了，舞女們是黑眼珠祗認識白洋　，那　　得上什麽愛情呢？二者未知孰是，待我把杜撰愛情二字的意義來　（四四）解一番，講得對與不對，諸位多多的指正。</p>
<p>愛之為言，心受之也，蓋必心有所感受，愛乃油然而生，這是單純的，是自我的。　如說，我愛某人或某物，無論什麽人，即其被愛之本身，都沒有權力可以不許我愛的。要愛就愛，不愛就不愛，豈不是很簡單很自由嗎。但人的性情決不會愛了就罷了的，必定要進一步想繼續感受，甚至想佔有。倘若你偶然看見一件可愛的東西，你愛它了，你必定會再去賞玩賞玩，甚至把它買了回來，佔爲已有。依此就可以推想到你要愛上一個人，也決不會愛了就算的，也必定要進一步，更進一步，甚至想佔爲己有。但人究竟不是一件東西，一件東西從人家手裏搬了過來，你就可算佔有了，人却不是這樣簡單，假使你佔有了軀壳，沒有佔有着　壳內的一顆心，它所表現出來的可　的　　字了。</p>
<p>情字是要　相互的，我愛她，她不愛我，愛情的條件，便不成立·不過自我方面觀察，愛的條件是成立的。所以人與物之間，祇有愛的條件，人與人之間，纔能有愛情的條件，這愛情的條件，必定要我愛她，她也愛我，纔算成立。但這　並沒有規定，必須要我愛她的什麽，她愛我的什麽，纔算愛情的條件成立。所以就一般的情形而論，在舞塲裏面，大都是舞客愛舞女的姿色，舞女愛舞客的鈔票。旣是雙方相愛，愛情的條件，怎能說不成立呢？基於這一個原則，甲說倒也不能說毫無理由。不過要進一步講，姿色衰敗了怎麼樣？鈔票化光了怎麽樣？其實這是毋　　言的，所愛的目的旣不存在，愛情的條件當然消失了，試將每日的報紙翻閱一下，那一天沒有這一類的新聞呢，乙說也可算有鑒及此而發的。</p>
<p>我說，愛情的原素，決不是僅僅姿色與鈔票所構成的即使構成，也是虛浮而不能維持久長的，人生的需要，難道祗有黃金與美色嗎？所以要講眞眞的愛情，要講能體會對方的情緒，供給對方的需要，古人云，得一知己，死而無憾，可是能領悟這意義的，能有多少人呢？</p>

<h3>園外紀　上海宜創一崑秦皮黃合演之劇院</h3>
<p>— 徐雲</p>
<p>此議旣定，遂按日登台演唱：忽一日以天氣奇冷，上座更形寥落，除付燈捐等費外，所餘者尙不足全班喝稀粥之費，當然世昌之梳頭費一元，即無法付給，翌日再演，此夥友竟罷工不到。世昌坐在後台久候，且前塲戲已將終，而某仍不至，於是後台　武行大動公忿，咸謂我等單挑一齣戲的角兒，每日猶不能領到一元，彼究係伺候角的，但按日無論怎樣艱難都得先付他一元，他才幹活。（幹活即作事）昨天因爲收入太少，未給他錢，他今天就一點義氣不講，不來幹活，這樣我們揍他一頓，大家散夥吧。當時不佞在北平聽到這種情形，着實覺得這般人太可憐啦，同屬藝人，何以皮黃班的名伶就如此豪華奢侈，崑班人就窮到爲一元錢全體解散，這不是太不平均了麽？再者說侯永奎的「林冲夜奔」，（王益友已死）不知比李萬春高出若干倍，韓世昌馬祥麟的「奇刺虎」「雙會」，也不見得弱於皮黃班的四大名旦。况且這班人用的工夫也不是三年五載的速成者，受了多少年的罪，連稀飯都喝不飽，眼瞧着皮黃班的新出科弟子，南下一趟，就是三千五千的大包銀賺進來，這也未免使他們太覺寒心，太爲不平，恐怕慢慢的就都要改行，都耍另投門路，而北方不絕如縷的崑弋班，也就從此絕跡歌壇成廣陵散了。（一一五）</p>

<h3>Hunan Army in Northern Hunan Continues Successes: Recovering Pingjiang, Xiangyin, and Yingtian; Simultaneously Capturing Miluo, Xinshi, Changshou Street, and Other Areas; Pursuing Troops Take Advantage to Advance and Occupy Huangsha Street and Dajing Street; Japanese Army Threatened in Xinqiang and Fleeing Northward</h3>
<p>Hengyang – Pingjiang and Xiangyin were successively recovered this morning. A portion of the Japanese army at Changle Street was surrounded by the Chinese. The Chinese army is unstoppable; the advancing troops have reached Huangsha Street. The Japanese army in Xinqiang is fleeing northward in extreme disarray. (Urgent telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Guilin – At dawn today, the Chinese army recovered Pingjiang (note: this city fell on the 28th of last month). Another unit recovered Xiangyin Yingtian. The Chinese pursuing troops advanced to Huangsha Street (30 kilometers north of the Miluo River) this afternoon and began mopping up the Japanese army towards Xinqiang. (Urgent telegram, 5:30 PM, 6th) From Pingjiang – The Chinese pursuing troops advancing from Wengjiang engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army near Pingjiang on the evening of the 5th, enduring three hours of intense combat. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated northward. The Chinese army officially recovered Pingjiang at 10 PM that night. (Urgent telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Changsha – The Japanese army in northern Hunan has now begun a complete collapse. The Chinese pursuing troops completely wiped out the Japanese army struggling with their backs to the river on the south bank of the Miluo River on the evening of the 5th, recovering Yingtian, Miluo, Xinshi, Pingjiang, and other places. Another pursuing force also occupied Xianshi, Changshou Street, and other areas east of Pingjiang simultaneously. All of the Miluo River is under Chinese control, with no trace of the Japanese army. That evening, the Chinese army took advantage of its victorious might and strongly crossed the Miluo River to continue the pursuit, leaving the Japanese army no room to breathe. On the morning of the 6th, Huangsha Street north of Miluo and Huanggu City north of Xinshi were also recovered. The vanguard troops are approaching Xinqiang, and the Japanese army has abandoned countless light and heavy ammunition along the way, as well as leaving behind corpses and many seriously wounded soldiers. Here, hearing of another great victory in northern Hunan, the residents are all overjoyed. (Urgent telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Miluo – The Chinese army, which occupied Huanggu Cha this morning, continued to pursue the retreating Japanese army, reaching Dajing Street, 30 li to the northeast, and captured the area in one fell swoop this afternoon. Dajing Street is located between the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers. Now that Huangsha Street on the railway front has also been recovered, the Chinese army, with these two opposing strongholds, can not only protect the Miluo River but also use them to recover the original positions on the south bank of Xinqiang. (Telegram, 9 PM, 6th)</p>
<p>Miluo – After the Chinese army recovered Baishui in Xiangyin, all units took advantage of the victory and advanced rapidly, recovering Yingtian, Miluo, Xinshi, and other key points on the evening of the 5th. Apart from fierce fighting in Yingtian, the Japanese army in other places retreated without even engaging in battle. There is now no trace of the Japanese on the south bank of the Miluo River. The Chinese pursuing troops crossed the river and advanced into Huangshi City (north bank of the Miluo Northern Tributary) on the morning of the 6th. Huangsha Street in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway was also recovered this morning. This place is only 30 li from Xinqiang, which can control the northwest of Lujiao and Jiuma Ji, and poses a major threat to the Japanese army on the south bank of the Xinqiang River. It is expected that the Chinese army will achieve even more remarkable feats between the two rivers. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Pingjiang – The Japanese army trapped in the Changshou Street and Xianshi areas was completely routed by the Chinese army after days of encirclement and annihilation. Changshou Street and Xianshi were recovered on the 5th. The area is currently being searched for scattered remnants of the Japanese army. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Changde – At 8 AM this morning, a telephone call from Yuanjiang reported that after the Japanese troops invading northern Hunan were defeated and routed, the small groups of Japanese remnants occupying the east and west banks of the Xiang River were panicked and also tried to find an opportunity to escape. To cover the withdrawal of these remnants, two Japanese warships sailed from Heye Lake to Jia Port (north of Liuxingshan) across from Yingtian at 4 PM yesterday and shelled Huanshan in the Chinese with more than a dozen shells. In the evening, the Japanese army entrenched on Liuxingshan boarded the ships and fled. The Chinese army then recovered Liuxingshan. At 8 PM, a Chinese unit took advantage of the darkness and crossed the Xiang River, directly attacking the Japanese nest from behind. The 200-300 Japanese remnants entrenched there put up slight resistance and fled in a hurry, boarding Japanese ships and fleeing towards Yueyang. Yingtian was also recovered by the Chinese at 2 AM last night. With the Japanese troops in Liuxingshan and Yingtian cleared, there is no trace of the Japanese along the Xiang River. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Fuliang – The Chinese army attacked the Japanese army on Ma'anshan the day before yesterday, taking advantage of the victory to strike fiercely. After seven hours of intense fighting, the Japanese army battalion commander Abe and more than 800 soldiers were completely annihilated. In the battle of Yuncang on the southern route of Huainan, the Japanese army commander, Lieutenant Colonel Miyazaki, was also killed by the Chinese army. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Gaoan – After the Chinese army recovered Longmen Factory and Zhuxi Factory, they launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Zhajin. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly, but after repeated assaults and fierce fighting by the Chinese army, hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated eastward, leaving behind many corpses. Zhajin was reported to have been recovered. The Chinese army is currently in pursuit. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Gaoan – The Japanese army suffered heavy losses after being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army at Ganfang Zhaoqiao. The remaining Japanese forces in the area are fleeing towards Jiuxianyang. The Chinese army is sending teams to track down and mop up. The Chinese army also discovered more than 300 Japanese corpses, more than 40 boxes of gasoline, and more than 40 boxes of bullets in the Shiwopu Mountains north of Jiuxianyang, as well as countless other military supplies, which the Japanese army did not have time to transport during their retreat. This shows the significant losses suffered by the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to a certain military authority, in the Battle of Northern Hunan, the Japanese army, with the Saito, Iyehisa, Amakasu, Fujita, and Ogiwara divisions, as well as special forces and naval landing forces, totaling tens of thousands of troops, coordinated by land, sea, and air. On one hand, they stirred up trouble in western Jiangxi in an attempt to contain the Chinese forces. On the other hand, they invaded southward along the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, attempting to take Changsha in one fell swoop. After starting to stir up trouble in northern Jiangxi on September 14, the Japanese army in northern Hunan launched a fierce attack on the Xinqiang River on the 23rd. At the same time, Japanese warships also entered the mouth of the Xiang River from Dongting Lake, operating on the flanks of the Chinese Xinqiang River and Miluo River positions. The Chinese army had long established its deployment in that area and was confident of success. Based on a set strategy, they adopted a defensive posture on the front while using powerful guerrilla forces in the Mufu Mountains to conduct flanking maneuvers, first inflicting significant losses on the invading Japanese army. Afterwards, they used necessary forces to defend the southern mouth of the Miluo River line, cleverly shifting the main force to the flank area, opening the front and luring the Japanese army deep into the pocket. The Japanese army fell for the trap and stuck its head into the bag. The Chinese army immediately seized the opportunity, using powerful forces to block Japanese reinforcements north of Pingjiang, while the forces south of Pingjiang unleashed their iron fists and launched a counterattack against the invading Japanese army. From the 27th to the 6th of this month, after more than ten days of fierce fighting, more than 30,000 Japanese soldiers were killed. Those who were wounded were unable to be transported to the rear due to the Chinese cutting off the rear lines. The remaining troops fled in disarray. The Chinese have crossed the Miluo River in pursuit, and advance pursuit units are lying in ambush. They are currently intercepting the retreating Japanese army in the area and launching an annihilation strike. Looking at the Battle of Northern Hunan, it is a larger defeat following the Battle of Suizao. The gains for the Chinese army and its contribution to the long-term war of attrition cannot be overstated. The rise and fall of the combat power of the Japanese and Chinese armies in this battle further solidifies the belief that the final victory is guaranteed. (Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Today, the Chinese Army Headquarters issued a public statement stating that the Chinese army has recovered Pingjiang, an important city on the road near the Hunan-Hubei border. (Reuters telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Jin-Yu Area – The Japanese army besieged in Changzhi, Changzi, Huguan, and other places in southeastern Shanxi suffered severe damage from the Chinese forces’ combined attacks.

<h3>Sichuan Province New Grain Storage Plan</h3>
<p>Chongqing – This year, Sichuan Province has reported a bumper harvest, and all parties are concerned that low grain prices will hurt farmers and affect people's livelihoods. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, with foresight, issued a telegram on August 22 to the Executive Yuan, instructing the responsible authorities to quickly purchase grain in large quantities in advance for relief. The Executive Yuan ordered the two ministries of finance and economy to comply. The Ministry of Economic Affairs then ordered the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to prepare. The Bureau prepared a draft outline of the Sichuan New Grain Purchase and Storage Plan in accordance with the spirit of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's original telegram and reported it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. It was approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on September 26, and approved by Chairman Wei. The plan is divided into two parts: one is to handle transportation and sales, and the other is to handle storage. For storage, the more than 130 counties in Sichuan are divided into three grades: first-grade counties store grain worth 60,000 yuan per county, second-grade counties 50,000 yuan per county, and third-grade counties 40,000 yuan per county. In addition to the 1.67 million yuan to be raised by the central government, the storage funds will be handled by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China. Regarding transportation and sales, the focus is on maintaining the minimum price, and supplementing surpluses and deficits is secondary. When the market price is lower than the standard price, purchases will be made at the standard price as much as possible. When the market price is higher than the standard price, purchases will be suspended. At the beginning of the implementation of the plan, each county must establish a People's Food Regulation Committee. The storage warehouses will be implemented by the committee in accordance with the instructions of the provincial agencies. According to the plan, X million shi of new grain will be transported and sold, X hundred X million shi will be stored in each county, and XXXXXX shi of military grain will be handled. Approximately XXXXXX shi of new grain can be purchased in Sichuan, equivalent to XXX hundred XX million dan, accounting for one-tenth of the total rice production in Sichuan. All warehouses, those used exclusively for storage, will be funded half by the Sichuan government, and the rest will be loaned by the Agricultural and Commercial Bank. Those used exclusively for transportation and sales, in addition to the Agricultural and Commercial Bank's existing warehouses, will be responsible for the establishment of warehouses as soon as possible. The total funds required are 15.416 million yuan, of which 7.67 million yuan will be allocated by the national treasury, 6.7 million yuan will be loaned by the four banks for storage funds, and all transportation and sales turnover will be handled by the four banks. The Agricultural and Commercial Bank is now waiting for Ji Zuyou to come to Chongqing from Rongcheng to discuss the implementation plan and will start handling it immediately. (Telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>Hitler can be called a great orator without shame! His speech yesterday is really worth reading. After reading it, no one can say that his call for peace is not sincere, he really does not want war! Because Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party, after years of military buildup and preparation to fulfill its desire for expansion, has created a huge Third Reich. But Germany does not have as large overseas colonies as Britain and France. Most of the raw materials for the military industry need to be imported from foreign countries, and its reserves are not as sufficient as those of Britain and France. He really is not suitable for war, let alone a long-term war. In terms of raw materials for the military industry, Germany needs to import 75% of iron sand, 80% of magnesium, 90% of kerosene and gasoline, 95% of copper, and 90% of lead from overseas, and it has no chromium (chromium) at all, so it needs 100%. The only raw material that Germany can supply itself is coal; but in fact, there are also problems. First, because Germany must use this to exchange some necessities lacking in Germany with its neighboring neutral countries. Second, because German workers are often in a state of idling. Third, because Germany lacks gasoline and rubber, etc., it has to use chemical methods to create artificial gasoline and artificial rubber. Coal is the main raw material for this compound; therefore, although the coal production is large, the consumption also increases. In addition, Germany's main coal-producing area is the Saar area, the current Western Front battlefield. Part of this coal-producing area has been occupied by France, and part has been destroyed by artillery fire, or at least targeted by artillery fire; in short, because of the Western Front war, it cannot all work as usual and supply as usual. After she occupied Poland, although part of it could be compensated by Poland's coal mines, how difficult is it for Polish miners to dig coal for the Germans to adapt to ideal efficiency! As for kerosene, Germany usually needs to consume more than 6 million tons per year; in wartime, it is estimated that it needs to consume 15 million to 20 million tons per year. Although the production of artificial gasoline can reach 2.5 million tons per year, it is still too far from the actual needs. These many material deficiencies are all factors that make Germany sincerely hope for peace. If Germany were rich in cash, it might not be difficult to avoid the enemy's blockade and purchase what it needs from various neutral countries; but unfortunately, this is almost like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger. It is said that at the beginning of this war, Germany only had 6 million pounds of gold reserves domestically and 10 million pounds of foreign exchange reserves abroad: how could this little amount be enough for war waste, let alone a long-term war?</p>
<p>Although the above figures were not published by the German side, so there may be some discrepancies with the actual situation, it is believed that they are not too far from the facts. In short, Germany's material resources are far inferior to those of Western European democratic countries, which is an undeniable fact. The British and French governments have repeatedly declared their determination to fight to the end and will defeat the National Socialist Party before they are finished. Regardless of what percentage of certainty such words have, or just express determination, but confronting each other on the front line is always a serious fact that Hitler cannot deny or avoid! Therefore, after winning Poland, and after Britain and France successively expressed their determination to fight, he did not completely respond to the enemies on the Western Front with the arrogance of a victorious hero; instead, he tried his best to use his strengths as a great orator, eloquently, to make up for the lack of material resources.</p>
<p>We observe from the side: we sincerely hope for an early peace in Europe, and sympathize with the endangered cultural heritage and millions of lives, and also acknowledge Hitler's sincerity in calling for peace, and every fragment of truth contained in his speech: if now is the early stage of the dispute between Germany and Britain and France, if now is the crossroads of war and peace, then this one speech alone can also hope to be effective; but we cannot help but regret that now is not the first page of the history of the dispute between Germany and Britain and France! In other words, if it were at the juncture of war and peace, peace might be found from this, but now it is difficult to end the war in the middle of the war!</p>
<h3>Hitler Delivers Speech, Presents Final Peace Proposal to Britain and France, Hold International Conference to Discuss General Solution, Delineate National Borders, Restore Poland According to Ethnicity Under German-Soviet Guarantee of Neutrality</h3>
<p>Berlin - Führer Hitler delivered a speech at exactly 12 noon today, with very peaceful wording. Mr. Hitler suggested resolving the acute problems caused by the Polish conflict, as well as basic international issues such as armaments, international trade, currency issues, and international security, through an international conference. Mr. Hitler's speech lasted two hours. The first twenty minutes described the German army's victory in the German-Polish battle, then he turned his attention to discussing German-Soviet relations and common interests. It is said that this is a key point in the transformation of German foreign policy. The friendship between Germany and the Soviet Union proves that Germany has no ambition to seize a superior position in the world, nor the desire to conquer Ukraine or the Ural region. External accusations against Germany are unfair. He only mentioned the issue of completing the revision of the Treaty of Versailles, saying that the final stage of completing the revision of this treaty required bloodshed, which was against Germany's initial wishes. It is claimed that the purpose of German foreign policy is to clarify Germany's relations with other countries. Mr. Hitler also mentioned that Germany signed non-aggression pacts with the Baltic coastal countries and Denmark, and solemnly stated that Germany has no demands on Denmark or Belgium. Germany's border with Hungary and Yugoslavia will not change. He then solemnly stated that Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy have long-standing friendships and reaffirmed that Germany has no territorial demands on France, either now or in the future. Mr. Hitler further stated that the German government is committed to reaching an understanding with Britain, and said that he still believes that world peace cannot be achieved without completing this understanding. Then Mr. Hitler discussed the peace between Germany and Britain and France. It is claimed that he is willing to raise the following questions before the people of the world: Why must war break out in Western Europe? Is our war aim to restore Poland as created by the Treaty of Versailles? Mr. Hitler believes that this goal cannot be achieved. Then, is the Western European war our desire to destroy Germany? Even if this goal can be achieved, similar problems will occur in the world within five years. Mr. Hitler discussed the solution to the Eastern European problem, saying that Germany's borders will conform to historical and ethnic needs, and the problems of all ethnic minorities in Eastern Europe must also be resolved. The need to solve the Jewish problem was also discussed. Mr. Hitler then mentioned the issue of rebuilding Poland, but it must not be allowed to adopt an anti-German policy, and consideration will also be given to creating a sense of security in Europe. The German government is willing to explain that its foreign political goal is to acquire colonies, which is Germany's last demand. Germany is willing to cooperate in reducing armaments and advocates abolishing warfare against women and children. Only after the restoration of peace and the convening of an international conference to solve all the above-mentioned problems can it be meaningful. As for the impact of the war, not only will the participating countries suffer, but also the whole world. At the end of his speech, Mr. Hitler reiterated that what he said above was his final proposal, and said that if warmongers reject it, he will not hesitate to fight to the end. (6th, Huitong) Hitler said that the most urgent problems for Germany at present are to establish fair and lasting German borders, adjust the order of Eastern Europe, adjust the issue of the large number of Jews in that area, and create a Polish state, so that no danger will occur in the area. Mr. Hitler then listed Germany's five demands as follows: (1) Appropriately resolve Germany's borders based on ethnic and social conditions, appropriately adjust German territory and various ethnic groups in southeastern Europe, resolve the Jewish problem, rebuild trade relations between countries, and establish a Polish state, with Germany and the Soviet Union guaranteeing its neutrality.

<h3>Hitler Praises War Achievements, Ridicules Poland for Misconduct</h3>
<p>Berlin - When the Reichstag convened in the Kroll Opera House, National Socialist members in brown uniforms and uniformed military officers returning from the Polish front were everywhere. All foreign envoys attended, and the whole place was silent, completely different from the previous sessions when the whole place shouted "Long live". At 12:05 noon, Führer Hitler walked into the hall and took his seat among the government officials. The whole place stood up to pay respect. Then, General Göring, Speaker of the Reichstag, announced the opening of the session and delivered a brief speech, commemorating the fallen soldiers. (6th, Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin - When Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the Reichstag, he reviewed the achievements of the German army in the Polish war, regarding it as an "unprecedented victory in history". He pointed out that the combat achievements completed by the German army in 18 days would have taken 14 months to complete 25 years ago. Hitler emphasized the humane nature of the German army's operations. He said, "I forbid sacrifices that are not absolutely necessary." Regarding the occupation of Warsaw, there was no question that the German army would break Warsaw's resistance. The German army's achievements from September 25 to 27 could have been achieved from September 10 to 12, but he wanted to avoid the sacrifices of the first-line German troops and hoped that Poland would have the opportunity to show responsibility and common sense, so he repeatedly decided to extend the deadline for the Warsaw garrison to surrender the city and the deadline for civilians to evacuate. Bombers and heavy artillery teams were also often ordered to only bomb various military targets. "My suggestion not to bomb the Praga district was to reserve a place for civilians to evacuate. I made two decisions to strive for the evacuation of foreigners, and after various difficulties, I succeeded. The German army began its offensive on September 25, and the Warsaw garrison surrendered on September 27." Hitler praised the achievements of the German army's infantry, tanks, air force, and submarines. He said, "The military power of a country with 36,000,000 people was completely destroyed within four weeks, and the victor did not suffer a single defeat. This cannot be regarded as a blessing of luck, but as proof of training, leadership, and courage." Hitler cited two examples to prove this. (1) General Blaskowitz led a division and advanced towards Warsaw on the left wing of General Reichenau's army. At the time, it was thought that the Polish army had retreated to the Vistula River, but it was suddenly intercepted by the Polish army. The Polish army attacked the German army with infantry and cavalry. The exhausted German army resisted five or six times its strength and fought bravely while waiting for reinforcements. When the Polish army broadcast the news of victory, the besieged German army had already reported to me that it had stopped the Polish army's activities. (2) The Second Reserve Division was ordered to suppress the Polish army, force it to retreat to the northern "corridor", occupy Gdynia, and advance towards the Hel Peninsula. The division encountered resistance from the elite units of the Polish army, but eventually advanced step by step in a few days, capturing 2,000 Polish soldiers and occupying Gdynia. The remaining 4,700 troops of the Polish army were forced to retreat to the Hel Peninsula. When the councilors stood up to pay respect, Mr. Hitler announced the exact number of German casualties in the German-Polish war. According to the statistics on September 30, 10,572 officers died, 30,322 were injured, and 3,409 were missing. He then said that the fortresses of Warsaw and Modlin and the Hel Peninsula had all surrendered. The Polish campaign had in fact come to a halt. As a result of the war, the Polish army was completely defeated and the Polish state had disintegrated. 694,000 prisoners have set off for Berlin, and the captured spoils are still difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitler then gave a detailed account of the history of Poland's founding and development after the European War. It is said that in 1919, the Poles claimed that Poles accounted for 95% of the residents in the land they demanded. Later, the results of the plebiscite proved that their statement was inaccurate. For example, in East Prussia, Poles only accounted for 2%.</p>
<p>Mr. Hitler also mentioned the abuse suffered by non-Poles, although 1.5 million Germans were forced to leave their families and were not allowed to carry essential items (such as clothing), Germany still established a tolerable relationship with Poland. Unfortunately, the Polish authorities made a mistake and thought this was a symbol of weakness.</p>
<p>After Mr. Hitler described the gradual increase in Poland's aggression against Danzig last spring, he still tried to reach an agreement with the Polish government. It is claimed that I thought about making it easier for the Polish government to accept our proposal and expressed to them that Germany was willing to guarantee Poland's independence, similar to the guarantee that Germany gave to Slovakia, but Poland refused. There are two reasons why Poland rejected Germany's proposal. (1) Poland harbored the ambition to occupy German territory and attempted to annex East Prussia, Pomerania, and Silesia, not only pushing the Polish border to the Oder River, but also as far as the Elbe River. (2) After Poland obtained the guarantees of Britain and France, although it was not threatened in any way, it brazenly provoked Germany, hoping to realize its ambition.</p>
<p>Hitler continued to describe Poland's atrocities against Germans, with many German villages being reduced to ruins and residents being brutally murdered, as well as other atrocities.</p>
<h3>Hitler Does Not Acknowledge Breach of Faith, Says He Is Determined to Lift the Constraints of the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>Berlin - Hitler said, "The authorities of Britain and France have repeatedly made statements, often using distrust of my promises as an excuse, but I have made promises to the German nation that they must be freed from the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles and restore their rights that are vital to their survival. I have fulfilled this promise. When foreign politicians accuse me of breaking faith, I protest because of this." (6th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Poor Response from Britain and France</h3>
<p>London - After Führer Hitler's speech in the German Reichstag was broadcast here by radio, the reaction from British political circles was very simple. They all said that the speech did not contain any new elements, and the so-called peace offensive was not as great as generally expected, nor did it provide any guarantees for the future situation. In general, people did not think it was different. In short, this speech "has no value at all." (6th, Havas)</p>
<p>Paris - After Führer Hitler's speech in the German Reichstag was transmitted here, the first reaction of French officials was that Hitler was repeating his old tricks, in other words, after each new incident, he repeatedly declared that there were no more demands, and other countries did not need to have any doubts, and that there were still some details to be resolved. His argument was nothing more than "As far as Poland is concerned, please let me and the Soviet authorities do whatever we want. The Baltic coastal countries have been assigned to the Soviet Union, and I have no demands. I did not fight against Poland, but Poland was the aggressor." In this way, the long-proclaimed peace plan contributes very little to the current situation. Although Germany is prepared to make peace, it must be allowed to do whatever it wants with the lands it has conquered and organize Southeastern Europe according to its own interests. That's all. As for Hitler's claim that he no longer has any territorial ambitions in Europe, it is also a well-worn phrase. He solemnly made this promise at the Munich Conference before he annexed Czechoslovakia. He also said this when he and the Soviet Union divided Poland. He did not provide any promises for the future situation, which is not in line with the prerequisites put forward by the governments of Britain and France. Britain and France can only remember his violations of faith and deal with them accordingly. (6th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union and Latvia Also Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty, Soviet Union Obtains the Right to Station Troops on Land, Sea, and Air, Will Sign Similar Treaty with Lithuania</h3>
<p>Moscow - Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov and Latvian Foreign Minister Menders began negotiations on the issue of concluding a mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union and Latvia on October 2. Those participating in the event on the Soviet side were Stalin, Potemkin, and Soviet Ambassador to Latvia Zotov. On the Latvian side were Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kosins. As a result, the mutual assistance treaty was signed on October 5. (5th, TASS)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the President of the Republic of Latvia, in order to develop the friendly relations established by the Treaty of Peace between the two countries of August 11, 1920, based on the principles of recognizing each other's national independence and non-interference in internal affairs, recognize the Treaty of Peace of August 11, 1920, and the Treaty of Mutual Non-Aggression and Peaceful Settlement of Conflicts of February 5, 1932, as the solid foundation of the friendly relations and obligations between the two sides, and jointly believe that it is in the interests of both countries to clearly state the concrete conditions for guaranteeing each other's security. Therefore, they determined that it was necessary to conclude the following mutual assistance treaty, and each appointed plenipotentiary representatives. On the side of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the plenipotentiary representative was Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union. On the side of the President of the Republic of Latvia, the plenipotentiary representative was Foreign Minister Menders. The two plenipotentiary representatives, after proving their qualifications to each other, met and agreed on the following conditions:</p>
<p>Article 1. The two Contracting States undertake to provide each other with all assistance, including military assistance, in the event that the sea borders of the two countries in the Baltic Sea, or the borders adjacent to the two Republics of Estonia or Lithuania, and the bases specified in Article 3, are directly invaded or threatened with invasion by any major European power.</p>
<p>Article 2. The Soviet Union undertakes to assist the Latvian army with armaments and other military equipment under favorable conditions.</p>
<p>Article 3. In order to safeguard the security of the Soviet Union and consolidate its own independence, the Republic of Latvia grants the Soviet Union the right to lease land in the towns of Liepāja (Liepāja) and Ventspils (Ventspils) at reasonable rents to establish naval bases and several airfields. The exact addresses and boundaries of these bases and airfields shall be designated by mutual agreement. In addition, in order to guarantee the Irbe Strait, the Soviet Union is also invited to establish coastal defense batteries along the coast between Ventspils and Pitrags under the same conditions. In order to protect the above-mentioned naval bases, airfields, and coastal defense batteries, the Soviet Union may station land and air forces in the designated locations at its own expense, with an absolute limit on the number of personnel. The maximum number of personnel shall be stipulated in a special agreement.</p>
<p>Article 4. The two Contracting States undertake not to conclude or participate in any alliance or group that is hostile to either Contracting State.</p>
<p>Article 5. The implementation of this Treaty shall not in any way affect the sovereignty of the two Contracting States, and they shall be allowed to maintain their state organizations, economic and social systems, and military facilities. The locations designated for the establishment of naval bases and airfields in Article 3 shall remain the territory of the Republic of Latvia.</p>
<p>Article 6. This Treaty shall come into effect after the exchange of instruments of ratification. This exchange of instruments shall be carried out in Riga within six days from the date of signing. This Treaty shall be valid for ten years. Unless one of the Contracting States considers it necessary to cancel it one year before the expiration, it shall automatically be extended for ten years thereafter.</p>
<p>The two plenipotentiary representatives have signed and confirmed this Treaty. It was established in Moscow on October 5, 1939, in two copies in Russian and Latvian. (6th, TASS)</p>
<p>Moscow - Molotov hosted a banquet last night to entertain Menders. During the banquet, Molotov and Menders exchanged toasts, and the atmosphere was exceptionally harmonious. On the same day, Menders and Gan set off from Moscow to return to their country. National flags of the two countries were hung all over the station, and there was a guard of honor to see them off. (6th, TASS)</p>
<p>Kaunas, Lithuania - Foreign Minister Urbšys returned to the country yesterday from Moscow, reporting on his talks with Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov, and will go to Moscow again. According to informed sources here, the Soviet Union wants Lithuania to sign a mutual assistance treaty with it, and has designated two places as Soviet air force bases. (5th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Withdraw from Lithuanian Bulge</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to official news agencies, Soviet troops have now withdrawn from the bulge on the border between East Prussia and Lithuania in accordance with the German-Soviet agreement. German troops will be able to take over completely on Saturday. Lithuania's border with Germany will then be twice as long as it was before the partition of Poland. The German-Soviet committee for demarcating the new border agreed that after the Soviet troops withdrew on Thursday, German infantry and engineering units would cross the border from four places. It is also claimed here that the last remaining 8,000 Polish troops surrendered to German troops at Kok, east of Diebelin, at 10 a.m. today. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Neutral Zone Established Along US Coast</h3>
<p>Washington - British Ambassador to the United States Lothian has asked US Secretary of State Hull to explain the significance of the neutral zone demarcated by the Pan-American Conference. After a journalist asked Hull whether this announcement contained any threatening meaning, Hull replied that the 21 republics of the Americas had agreed that if any belligerent state did not accept or comply with its decision, the 21 republics would consult with each other on how to deal with it. According to this, the neutral zone extends from the coast of the New World to the sea, in some places as far as 600 miles. Hostile or belligerent acts are not allowed in this area. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London - After the Pan-American Conference passed the "Declaration of Panama" and decided to establish a safe zone within 300 miles of the coast of the Americas, British naval officials refused to express their opinions because they had not yet received more detailed information, only saying that it would be beneficial and harmless to demarcate a large safe zone on the sea.

<h3>German Submarine Sunk by French Oil Tanker, British Navy Intensifies Search of the Sea, Ship Accidents Have Been Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>According to current information from Paris, a French oil tanker has sunk a German submarine. It is said that after the submarine was hit, a terrible vibration occurred, and then oil stains were found on the nearby sea. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Paris - A French oil tanker sank a German submarine yesterday. People were surprised when they heard about it. According to the shipowner, when the ship was sailing to a certain sea area at 6:30 p.m. yesterday, it found what looked like a submarine in front of it, so it quickly changed its direction of advance. In a short while, a loud bang was heard, and the ship was suddenly hit violently, followed by an explosion. The whole ship was shaken incessantly, and at the same time, waves splashed on the deck. Soon after, a vortex appeared on the sea, and a large amount of gasoline floated up. In an instant, all was silent. It was then known that a submarine had been sunk. Naval experts said that this matter is very easy to understand, because in order to avoid attacks from enemy warships and airplanes, submarines are often unwilling to constantly expose their periscopes to the surface of the water, so after catching a glimpse of an enemy ship, they often immediately sink in order to sneak to the vicinity of the ship they are preparing to attack, and then launch torpedoes. However, if the ship that is becoming the target of attack suddenly changes its course, the submarine is very likely to collide with it while secretly advancing, causing it to sink itself. Yesterday's event was probably like this. (5th, Havas)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Information recently issued a public statement stating that since the British Navy has stepped up its search for German submarines, the number of ship accidents in this country has been decreasing day by day. In summary, in the first week of the war, the tonnage of ships in this country that were sunk totaled 85,000 tons, in the second week it decreased to 46,000 tons, in the third week it decreased to 21,000 tons, in the fourth week it decreased to 9,000 tons, and in the fifth week it was only 876 tons. It can be seen that the various measures taken by the naval authorities are truly effective. Although the German side issued news that German submarines had been attacked by British armed merchant ships and falsely accused British merchant ships of becoming disguised destroyers, none of these were accurate. It is clear that the country's slander in this way is intended to create new excuses to continue attacking British merchant ships and ships of various neutral countries. As far as the current situation is concerned, it is credible that half of the country's submarines operating at sea have been lost. As for the pirate ship that appeared once on the sea off the coast of Brazil, there has been no trace of it so far. The British Navy has taken various secret measures to wipe out pirate ships when they are encountered. (5th, Havas)</p>
<h3>"Iroquois" Returns from Europe, US Receives Warning from Germany, Clearly a German Propaganda Strategy</h3>
<p>Washington - The White House announced last night that German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder formally warned the US government that the "Iroquois," which is currently carrying American expatriates back to the country, will suffer the same fate as the "Athenia" when it approaches US territory. According to a report from President Secretary O'Leary, Admiral Raeder said that the information he obtained came from reliable sources. Germany's intention in this move is to push the responsibility for the "Athenia" sinking case to Britain and France, saying that after Britain and France sank ships carrying American expatriates, they publicized that this was done by the German side, the common intention of which was to drag the United States into the Allied forces to fight. O'Leary said that the US government does not take this warning very seriously. The government has instructed the captain of the "Iroquois" to be extra vigilant and has sent a cruiser to escort the voyage. The "Iroquois" left Ireland on October 2, and all passengers were American expatriates. The German Embassy here said that it had not received any news about this matter. (6th, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington - Germany warned the United States that someone was trying to sink the American ship "Iroquois" near the American coast. The news was quite shocking here, but the government believed that this was an extraordinary propaganda strategy, because Germany surmised that American public opinion had already believed the previous German claim that the American ship "Athenia" was sunk by a British ship. However, Americans clearly did not believe it, so Washington found it strange that Germany would make this new propaganda on the basis of having lost credibility in order to gain something. It is now known that the "Iroquois" carries a total of 584 passengers and crew members, all of whom are Americans. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Western Front Quiet; German Army Preparing for Large-Scale Frontal Assault on French Maginot Line</h3>
<p>Paris - General Headquarters announced in its 63rd war bulletin, "Reconnaissance units of both enemy and our forces were engaged in various locations today. Other than that, the entire front was quiet." (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris - The focus of attention on the Western Front has shifted to the Mersch and Saar corridors east of Luxembourg. The French army's raid near the Luxembourg border has completely occupied the Borg Forest, and assault troops have consolidated their captured positions. The German army is desperately trying to prevent the French from continuing their advance in the western part of this corridor for two reasons: (1) A French advance would threaten any German plans to violate Luxembourg's neutrality and greatly reduce the space for German maneuvering; (2) If the French were to reach the outskirts of Boulay, six miles from the French border, the forward defenses of the Siegfried Line to the south would be weakened and vulnerable to a flank attack by the French. Some new German tanks are equipped with six-inch guns, apparently intended for attacking artillery forts. Therefore, observers now believe that the German General Staff may prefer a large-scale frontal assault on the Maginot Line rather than a flanking maneuver through neutral countries. A French war bulletin issued last night stated that the front was quiet all day, with reconnaissance patrols active at various points. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>India Forms Two Air Force Squadrons to Aid Britain in War</h3>
<p>London - The Information Department announced that the Indian government has formed two active and reserve air force squadrons to assist Britain in the war. Mr. Fraser, New Zealand Cabinet Associate and Education Minister, will come to London to attend the Imperial Conference. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - According to news from the Indian capital, the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, had another lengthy discussion with Gandhi yesterday, discussing the current international situation. It is reported that Gandhi will report the content of the talks to the Indian National Congress. The Viceroy then met with Indian Muslim leaders for discussions. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Seventeen British and Swedish Cargo Ships Detained in Soviet Territory</h3>
<p>Moscow - According to authoritative sources, twelve British and five Swedish ships, carrying cargo to England, have been detained by Soviet authorities in the port of Murmansk. It is claimed that the Soviet Union is taking this measure based on a decree issued by the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on September 9, which stipulates that if a country takes measures unfavorable to Soviet international trade, the Soviet Union will detain cargo bound for that country. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Americans Sympathetic to China Promote "Bowl of Rice" Movement to Raise Funds for Chinese Refugees</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, New York dispatch - The Chinese Refugee Relief Association launched a "Bowl of Rice" movement in major American cities last year to raise donations, with very good results. It is now scheduled to conduct this campaign again in October, with an earnest appeal from the president, Mr. S. Roosevelt (nephew of the late President Roosevelt), requesting the sincere support of people from all walks of life. He stated, "Liuzhou City in Guangxi Province, China, was wantonly bombed by 27 Japanese aircraft in September of this year, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries. There were no surgical instruments available to treat the injured. The suffering of Chinese civilians is evident from this. They desperately need minimal relief from the terror from the sky. More than 50 million people are homeless in China. It is our bounden duty to rescue them from their plight." From this, it can be seen that although the European war has caused anxiety in the United States, the Chinese refugee relief work has not been affected.</p>
<h3>Germany Forbids Listening to Foreign Broadcasts; Secret Police Use Tricks to Arrest People</h3>
<p>Paris - The Paris Evening News quotes a telegram from Souletique, claiming that German secret police have adopted new tricks to arrest Germans who listen to foreign broadcasts. They place small advertisements in German newspapers stating, "A shop sells used radios that can receive signals from all European stations." Anyone who goes to the shop to buy a radio is seized by two policemen. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Opposition to the Ministry of Trade Movement; Japanese Political Strife Expands; All Ministry of Foreign Affairs Staff Resign</h3>
<p>Tokyo - All section chiefs and administrative officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a board meeting on the morning of the 5th and decided to resign en masse, urging Foreign Minister Nomura to streamline diplomacy and handle matters properly. In the afternoon, all bureau chiefs and 250 subordinate officials also joined. The movement against the establishment of a Ministry of Trade has spread to all administrative staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Taniguchi Masashi summoned representatives of the administrative authorities at 3:30 p.m., stating that he would strive to realize everyone's hopes within the scope of matters decided by the cabinet, and hoping that everyone would not act rashly. However, the representatives rejected this statement and resigned. The section chiefs and administrative officials then held a plenary meeting starting at 5:30 p.m., resolving to submit suggestions to the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. The issue is gradually expanding and becoming more complicated.</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today published news about the internal strife in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in prominent positions. It is reported that all personnel of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including 300 lower-level staff, have resigned. Yesterday afternoon, a four-member committee representing the civil servants met with Foreign Minister Nomura, explaining in detail that the establishment of a separate Ministry of Trade completely disregards the inseparable nature of overseas politics and economic diplomacy, and therefore, from a national policy standpoint, it is absolutely unacceptable. Nomura should reconsider his attitude and insist to the cabinet on the necessity of diplomatic unification. Nomura replied that he could not accept this view and that the opponents were overstepping their duties as civil servants. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - It is reported that the Cabinet is taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the internal strife in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Semi-official circles here believe that Foreign Minister Nomura will be able to resolve this dispute satisfactorily. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs convened a meeting of staff representatives at 11:30 last night, urging them to resume their duties as usual and accept the Cabinet's adopted procedure of establishing a Ministry of Trade. After the meeting, Foreign Minister Nomura made the following statement to reporters: "I listened to the opinions of the representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs staff for more than an hour and expressed my views. However, the attitude of some younger staff members still seems very strong. I do not know if I can persuade them. Although I cannot say for certain that there will be a serious conflict, I am prepared to deal with the situation no matter what." (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Foreign Minister Nomura will meet with Prime Minister Abe this morning to discuss the incident of more than 300 staff members of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs resigning due to the establishment of the new Ministry of Trade, and to submit the resignation letters of the resigning personnel. "Asahi Shimbun" criticized the incident today, saying that the government will not change its decided policy and will establish the Ministry of Trade as soon as possible. According to the "Chugai Commercial News," Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Mr. Kawai has refused to accept the appointment as ambassador to Thailand. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Thirty-Nine American Warships Sail to Hawaii</h3>
<p>Los Angeles - It was previously reported that 45 American warships were ordered to sail to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. It is now known that 39 of them sailed to Hawaii on Thursday morning, including the aircraft carrier "Enterprise," carrying 80 aircraft, 6 heavy cruisers, 1 light cruiser, and 31 destroyers.

<p>San Diego - Thirty-nine American warships, carrying 106 aircraft and accompanied by a large number of fleet reconnaissance troops, sailed to Hawaii late last night. After arriving at Pearl Harbor, the naval concentration in Hawaii will be the most substantial ever, except during major exercises. According to official sources, this action has been under consideration for several months and is for training purposes. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Visited Warsaw Yesterday; Reviewed the Invading Polish Troops; Issued a Letter of Consolation to the Soldiers; Returned to Berlin by the Same Plane that Evening</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to a report from a special correspondent of the German News Agency regarding Führer Hitler's inspection of Warsaw, Hitler departed from Berlin by plane early yesterday morning and arrived at the Warsaw Central Airport at 11:30 a.m. after a two-and-a-half-hour flight. German Army Commander-in-Chief von Brauchitsch, Air Force Chief Milch, Army Commander Rundstedt, Army Commander List, Air Force Commander Loehr, Kesselring, Warsaw Garrison Commander Lieutenant General Kitzinger, and others welcomed him at the airport. All the generals wore the Iron Cross medals they had recently received for their meritorious service in the Polish campaign. After Hitler inspected the honor guard, he stepped out of the airport to the sound of the German national anthem and went to the Skola command headquarters. After a short meeting, Hitler drove to visit the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the "European Hotel," and the diplomatic residence area of Ujazdowskie Avenue. Most of the city was not damaged. Hitler then reviewed the German troops at the command platform built in the middle of the street. The troops paraded for two hours. After the review, Hitler went to pay his respects at "Belweder," the former residence of the late Polish President Marshal Piłsudski. The interior and exterior were intact, and Piłsudski's military uniforms were on display. Hitler seemed deeply moved by this Polish general who advocated German-Polish peace. Hitler then returned to the airport and returned to Berlin by the same plane that evening. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Führer Hitler and the supreme commanders of the German army issued the following letter of consolation to the soldiers on the Eastern Front yesterday: "Soldiers on the Eastern Front, in early September you protected Germany from Poland. Today, the army, navy, and air force have all fulfilled their military duties. Today, I take this opportunity to congratulate you on the victory of Warsaw. The German military operation in Poland demonstrated the good military spirit of German soldiers everywhere. The people of the whole country are delighted with your meritorious service to the country. The previous European war sacrificed 2 million soldiers. Today, your victory makes the future of Germany unshakeable. Marching forward under the same national flag, I believe that you will be loyal to the country and serve the country at any time." [Hitler's Seal], October 5, 1939. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Full Text of Hitler's Speech (Continued) (Continued from Page 4)</h3>
<p>German women and children in villages were also abused and massacred. If one percent of these atrocities had occurred in British territory, British gentlemen would have condemned it in hypocritical and horrified tones.</p>
<p>Hitler continued that Poland had mistaken Germany's tolerance for weakness and believed that Germany's concessions indicated that it could continue to invade. Poland also misunderstood the German government's sense of responsibility and the German leader's determination to reach an understanding.</p>
<p>German-Soviet Agreement</p>
<p>The foundation of the German-Soviet treaty is based on common interests. Not only do the two countries have the same relevant issues, but both countries also recognize the need to cooperate with each other. Since Stalin does not consider Sovietism an obstacle to establishing friendly relations with other political ideologies, there is no reason for National Socialist Germany to take a different path. The two countries respect each other's different ideologies and systems, and there is no longer any reason for hostility. The German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact is a turning point in Germany's entire foreign policy. The two countries can not only maintain peaceful relations but can also cooperate permanently. Germany is not striving for world hegemony, nor does it want to seize the Ural Mountains, Ukraine, Romania, or other territories. The German-Soviet agreement can prove this. Disputes cannot be allowed to arise between Germany and the Soviet Union, so the boundaries of spheres of influence have been delineated, and each maintains security and order within its sphere of influence while avoiding harming the interests of other countries. Germany's tasks within its sphere of influence are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establishing German borders, taking into proper consideration historical, ethnic, and economic conditions.</p>
<p>(2) Pacification work, ensuring the security of German territory and the security of Germany's sphere of influence.</p>
<p>(3) Most importantly, establishing a new order based on racial needs, allowing all ethnic groups to obtain more reasonable ethnic boundaries.</p>
<p>Hitler said that the German people are scattered throughout Eastern and Southeastern Europe, are not easily assimilated, and must adopt a long-term policy to establish a new European order and eliminate potential friction. Germany and the Soviet Union have agreed to mutually assist in resolving this issue.</p>
<p>Land Demands</p>
<p>Hitler reviewed Germany's relationship with the League of Nations, believing that the League was a tool for maintaining the Treaty of Versailles. He said, "If 46 million British people can demand to rule 40 million square kilometers of land, then 82 million German people's demand for 800,000 square kilometers of land and the return of colonies should not be considered inappropriate. Germany's demands are limited to the most vital survival interests. If the natural survival interests of the German people are not directly threatened, I will advise the German people to abandon their demands. All countries in the world desire peace, and none are as eager as Germany.</p>
<p>Relations with Other Countries</p>
<p>At this point, Hitler discussed Germany's relations with its neighbors and the great powers, analyzing and discussing them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Germany has concluded non-aggression treaties with the Baltic states, and their interests are purely economic.</p>
<p>(2) Germany has no disputes with the Nordic countries in the past or today. Germany would have proposed signing non-aggression treaties with Sweden and Norway, but those two countries believed that they were not threatened and did not need to conclude them.</p>
<p>(3) Germany has no old grievances with Denmark. Although the Treaty of Versailles would have ceded a portion of German territory to Denmark, Germany and Denmark later resolved their differences and signed a non-aggression treaty.</p>
<p>(4) As for German-Dutch relations, they have always been harmonious, and there have never been any differences between the two countries.</p>
<p>(5) Since I came to power, Germany has strived to strengthen relations with Belgium. I have abandoned any demands on Belgium, even the intention to make demands at all.</p>
<p>(6) As for Yugoslavia, after I annexed Austria, I guaranteed it that the German-Yugoslav border was the final border. Germany will maintain peace with Yugoslavia forever.</p>
<p>(7) Germany adopts the exact same attitude towards Switzerland as it does towards Belgium. There has never been any doubt regarding the friendship of the two countries.</p>
<p>(8) Germany and Hungary have a traditional friendship, and the German-Hungarian border will never change.</p>
<p>(9) When Slovakia became independent, it automatically requested German support, and Germany recognized its independence.</p>
<p>(10) Regarding the great powers, first discuss German-Italian relations. It is forcefully stated that the German-Italian border has been solemnly guaranteed and will never change. The enemies of the World War have become the closest allies, concluding a covenant based on ideology and politics, becoming a</p>
<p>(11) Regarding France and Germany, efforts have been made to eliminate the bad atmosphere, hoping to create a situation that is tolerable to both sides. Therefore, the Alsace-Lorraine issue is never mentioned. No French politician can say that Germany has made demands on France.</p>
<p>(12) As for British-German understanding, it has been my life's goal. Even today, I still believe that there can be no peace in Europe unless British-German relations improve. Based on this belief, I decided to take the path of peaceful negotiations. If it fails, the responsibility does not lie with me. At this point, Hitler raised a major question, investigating the cause of the war on the Western Front:</p>
<p>(1) Will it be for the restoration of Poland under the Treaty of Versailles? I solemnly declare today that the Versailles policy can never be revived. With Germany and the Soviet Union guaranteeing this, the Polish issue should be decided entirely by Germany and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(2) Has Germany made any demands that endanger the interests of the British Empire? I firmly say no. I have never made any demands on Britain or France.</p>
<p>Current Problems</p>
<p>Hitler continued that the current problems are nothing more than two: one is to resolve the problems caused by the disintegration of Poland, and the other is to eliminate the international difficulties that endanger the political and economic survival of all countries. Germany believes that the following six steps must be taken to rebuild order in the area west of the German-Soviet dividing line:</p>
<p>(1) Creating Germany's historical, geographical, and economic borders.</p>
<p>(2) Reorganizing the living space based on ethnic principles.</p>
<p>(3) Attempting to adjust the Jewish question.</p>
<p>(4) Reorganizing economic life and improving transportation convenience.</p>
<p>(5) Ensuring the security of the area.</p>
<p>(6) Establishing a plot-free area within the territory to threaten German-Soviet relations. Germany's goal in adjusting the entire European situation is twofold: on a smaller scale, to establish order politically and reorganize economically in the center of European turmoil; on a larger scale, the entire Europe must first establish a sense of security. To achieve this goal, first, all countries must frankly state their diplomatic objectives. Germany's diplomatic objective, in a nutshell, is: "Abolish the Treaty of Versailles." There is nothing else to seek.</p>
<p>As for the colonial issue, Germany is appealing based on fair principles and economic common sense, not wanting to threaten with force. Second, to achieve the goal of adjusting the entire world's peace, international trade and transportation must be developed, and the production of all countries must be adjusted to meet actual needs. Markets and currencies must be reorganized so that obstacles to the exchange of goods and free trade can be gradually removed. Third, and most importantly, is the absolute guarantee of peace and the establishment of a sense of international security. Among these, disarmament is the most prerequisite. I have repeatedly proposed motions on this issue in the parliament, but they have all been rejected, probably because I proposed them. I firmly believe that Europe can only restore a sense of security after international agreements define the legal and illegal use of armaments. The Geneva Protocol prohibits (A) killing wounded soldiers, (B) abusing prisoners of war, (C) attacking non-combatants, (D) using poison gas, (E) using submarines, and stipulates the types of prohibited items. Indeed, the methods of modern warfare are becoming increasingly terrible and must be abolished. In the Polish war, I tried to limit air warfare, only bombing military targets, and drafting effective international regulations is certainly possible. Europe can maintain peace, and the foundation for economic prosperity can also be established. I do not believe that there are responsible politicians in Europe who do not want their people to enjoy prosperity. This wish must be realized by the cooperation of European countries. Those who work for the future of the nation should aim to assist this cooperation. To achieve this great goal, the major European powers will one day jointly draft solutions so that all countries have a sense of security, tranquility, and peace. However, preparatory work must be carried out before this meeting is held. This meeting can never be held amidst the sounds of cannons. The continuation of the status quo on the Western Front is unimaginable. The number of daily sacrifices will inevitably increase. If one day France attacks Saarbrücken and destroys it, then Germany will destroy Mülhausen. If the French army advances and attacks Freiburg, then the German army will retaliate in Strasbourg. In other words, the artillery of both countries will penetrate deeper and deeper into the other country. If that is the case, some international journalists will find it interesting, and aircraft merchants and arms dealers will make huge profits. However, the people will suffer, and the suffering of the victims will be unspeakable. In the future, there will be new territories between Germany and France, but they will not be prosperous cities but ruined wastelands. The reason I make this argument is to hope that our people can escape the suffering of war. If I cannot persuade Churchill and his followers, then this is my last statement. We have no choice but to fight to the end.</p>
<h3>US Senate Heatedly Debates Neutrality Amendment Bill; Stimson Broadcasts to the Nation, Advocating Repeal of Arms Embargo</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. O'Leary, answered questions today, saying that the Senate seems to be inclined to vote in favor of the government's Neutrality Act, which is very gratifying. Senator Walter George, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that the Senate would consider amending the two points of shipping restrictions and 90-day credit. When the Senate resumed debate, Republican Mr. Nye and Democrat Mr. Overton both spoke against the repeal of the arms embargo. Mr. Nye demanded that the government implement the cash-and-carry bill without repealing the embargo. Mr. Overton claimed that repealing the embargo was tantamount to armed intervention in the European war. Democrat Mr. Schwertner defended his statement, saying that the government's Neutrality Act is the most complete and orderly method of avoiding war ever implemented by any country. If Congress does not intentionally want to involve the United States in the European war, then the best way to do so is to pass the current bill. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Senate continued its debate today on the Neutrality Act amendment bill proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Dupe, a Republican isolationist stalwart, delivered a speech strongly opposing the repeal of the arms embargo clause, advocating that the original bill be divided into two parts: one concerning restrictions on domestic trade with belligerent countries, and one concerning the repeal of the arms embargo clause, and then voted on separately. The isolationist senators supported this proposal, hoping to use this tactic to pass the first bill, namely the clause on "cash transaction, transportation on their own responsibility," and reject the second bill, namely allowing arms to be shipped to belligerent countries. The government senators, on the other hand, believed that if the original bill were divided into two, it would have to be sent back to the Foreign Relations Committee for review, which would inevitably delay the process, and they would do their best to avoid it. In addition, Republican Senator Nye (also a leader of the isolationist faction) supported the implementation of the "cash transaction, transportation on their own responsibility" method, but opposed the repeal of the arms embargo clause as a condition for exchange, believing that this would endanger American peace. Democratic Senator Overton also made the same argument, which was immediately refuted by the original proposer, Senator Pittman, who strongly argued that the current Neutrality Act is not neutral, and that its nature is beneficial to continental countries and not to maritime countries; also, its content prohibits the shipment of arms to belligerent countries, but does not prohibit the export of cotton or other goods used for war. At this point, Democratic Senator Schwertner stood up to defend the Pittman bill and put forward a new legal argument, saying that a neutral country is prone to trigger liability problems because of passing laws prohibiting the shipment of arms to belligerent countries, because belligerent countries, after discovering that merchants of the neutral country have violated this law, will inevitably protest against it, or even wage war against it under the pretext of violating the treaty. On the contrary, if the neutral country acts in accordance with international law and does not prohibit the export of arms, then the belligerent countries, even if they issue a "contraband" list, cannot criticize it as a violation of neutrality. The slogan commonly used by the opposition is that the Pittman bill will plunge the United States into the whirlpool of war. In fact, after further research, it must be known that this statement is difficult to establish. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Christianity in China: The Spirit is Now Understood by the Masses</h3>
<p>(Havas News Agency Air Mail from New York) The Executive Committee of the North American Foreign Mission Conference has recently announced that the preaching of Christianity in China for the past two years has not been hindered by the war, but rather stimulated by it. This proves that the experience of the past two years shows that Christianity is a source of strength, vitality, and hope during wartime and is also necessary. Although the daily lives and minds of the Chinese people have suffered various hardships, their spiritual life has continued to grow. Churches everywhere are crowded, and Christian groups in schools are increasing and are full of vigor. The sales of the Bible are so great that the supply cannot meet the demand. In short, the spirit of service of the Christian church has been understood and recognized by the Chinese masses.</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army's Difficult Battles in Chao-Shan: Japanese Troops on the Chao Coast Still Besieged; Japanese Warships Still Fail to Invade Shantouwei</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: A certain division of the Chinese army stationed in Jieyang moved to the Sangpu Mountains in early September, controlling the central area of Chao'an, Chenghai, and Jieyang counties. From a commanding position, they adopted a proactive offensive posture. On the evening of September 11, after the Chinese Zhenzhong Brigade conquered Anbu and besieged Shantou, the division cooperated with the local security forces and guerrillas to control the outskirts of Chaozhou. In the past ten days, they have twice attacked Chaozhou city, annihilating many Japanese soldiers. On the 12th, Chaozhou city was still surrounded by the Chinese army, with the vanguard only one mile from the city walls. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the Chinese army's forward headquarters encountered more than 200 Japanese infantry and cavalry at the northern foot of Hulu Mountain, engaging in a battle until sunset. The Japanese army was still defeated and retreated towards Yixi Station. The An-Jie Road battlefield in Fengxi and Yunbudi had repeatedly defeated Japanese cavalry and artillery. On the 12th, some traitors led a Japanese army unit of 40 to 50 men in civilian clothes to reconnoiter the Chinese army's position. They were discovered by Chinese sentries, and both sides engaged in battle. The Chinese army killed more than 20 Japanese soldiers. However, the Japanese army repeatedly tried to break through the encirclement line of Chaozhou city and turned to invade Jieyang, also dispatching several thousand reinforcements from Qiongzhou, Weizhou Island, Nanpeng Island, and Nan'ao, but their morale was low and they had no fighting spirit. These reinforcements advanced towards the front of the Chao-Shan Railway on the 13th. Anbu, Caitang, Fuyang, and other stations, which had been recovered by the Chinese army, upon learning of the large Japanese force, the Chinese army retreated in advance to villages in the Sangpu Mountains to observe the Japanese army's strength. The Japanese army, thinking that the Chinese army was afraid to fight, recklessly attacked Sangpu Mountain, Hailian Mountain, and Shaxi, engaging in fierce battles with the Qiu and Gui battalions of the Chinese security forces. By 3:00 PM, they abandoned more than 30 bodies and retreated in defeat. The Chinese army seized five rifles and one machine gun. The Chinese Hua Zhenzhong Brigade learned that the newly added Japanese army numbered only 400 men. That evening, they once again launched a military encirclement of Anbu and attacked Fuyang and Gezhou. On the 14th, Japanese strongholds in Chao'an and Shantou were closely besieged by the Chinese army, and the encirclement became tighter and tighter. Units of the ××× Group stationed in Fengshun, Wuhua, and Meixian also joined the fighting near Chao'an, assigning a strong brigade to encircle every stronghold at Zhuhao Mountain, Jinshan, Hulu Mountain, Bijia Mountain, and Jianghugong, cutting off their communication. The local militia and guerrillas stood on the outer lines, resolutely cutting off Japanese army's water and land transportation. Several Japanese army units have been trapped for many days without supplies, so the Japanese army in Chao-Shan is currently in a difficult battle. Furthermore, on the afternoon of the 13th, the Japanese army sent five warships and eight aircraft to cover 400 Japanese soldiers in a forced landing at Shantouwei. The Chinese army on the shore ambushed and engaged in battle. By 2:00 AM on the 14th, the Japanese army was still defeated and returned to the warships. At noon on the 14th, they sent warships to harass Chenghai and Chaoyang, attempting to disperse the Chinese forces in order to relieve the Japanese army's strongholds, but when the rubber boats approached the shore, they were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army and civilians, and they ultimately failed. Therefore, the dire situation of the Japanese army in Chao-Shan is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army in Jiangyin: Seducing People to Return; Deadline of One Month to Return or Homes Will Be Confiscated</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: Before the war, Cheng County had a population of more than 5,000 households, totaling more than 25,000 men, women, and children. Since the Japanese army occupied it, residents have fled to other places or moved to rural villages. Although a small number have returned in nearly two years, according to recent surveys, the population of Dongnei is only 2,717, Nannei 1,192, Xinei 1,775, and Beinei 3,281. Homes that were destroyed have not been able to be rebuilt. Last month, the head of the Japanese garrison, Miyake Diaoxi, was replaced by Shiseino. Seeing the desolation in the city and the residents of the city and suburbs avoiding returning, he ordered the head of the Japanese special service team, Hata, to issue many printed materials, threatening the people to return. The language was extremely exaggerated, full of lies. The original text roughly stated that since the military situation in the county has been stabilized, local order has long been restored, and the market is also progressing daily. However, it has been found that while some have gradually returned from their refuge in other places due to the incidents, there are still many who have delayed returning. Now, regarding the population of a corner of the city and suburbs, based on the current Baojia system, the total number is far different from the original number. Empty houses and closed doors are often seen, without a single person. If this continues, what will become of things? Now, with the permission of the garrison, we are instructed to earnestly advise you, otherwise, we will decide to dispose of the houses, even the foundations, and move them for other construction. All people who have taken refuge elsewhere must be informed that each of you has a family fortune, why bother to give it up voluntarily? After this advice, all those who have taken refuge elsewhere must return as soon as possible within one month. If you delay intentionally, once the houses are disposed of, there will be no regrets, etc. However, despite such threats from the Japanese, middle- and upper-class people have not returned at all, treating it with indifference, which shows that the Japanese army finds this desolate city extremely boring.</p>
<h3>The Miserable Living Conditions of Residents Inside Wuxi City: Puppet Government Orders County Resident Certificates; Fuel Shortage and Market Chaos</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The puppet county government of Xiyi, following the wishes of the Japanese, in order to prevent Chinese patriots from entering the city, stipulated that from the 1st, all residents in the city would be issued county resident certificates. The procedures for issuing them are quite cumbersome, requiring certification from the puppet Baojia heads. Those with county resident certificates do not need to obtain travel permits when traveling outside. Therefore, the residents of Wuxi are increasingly suffering. Recently, there has been an unusual shortage of fuel in the city. Because farmers bringing firewood to the city are generally stopped by Chinese mobile teams, the price of rice straw is only eight catties per yuan. The lives of the residents are miserable. The market has been extremely chaotic since the shortage of copper coins and fractional currency. There are tens of thousands of bamboo tokens used as fractional currency. However, recently, there has also been an unusual shortage of one-yuan legal tender and one- or two-jiao notes. For example, exchanging five yuan of legal tender for one yuan is impossible, and exchanging one yuan of legal tender for one- or two-jiao notes is also a fantasy. Merchants have insufficient capital turnover. The reason for the shortage is that someone is manipulating it in secret.</p>
<p>Most of the pigs come from Jiangbei, and a small number are raised by local farmers. Recently, the number of pigs arriving has suddenly decreased, with only about 20 pigs arriving each day, leading to an excess of demand over supply. The price of raw pigs has risen from 48 yuan per dan to 50 yuan to 53 or 54 yuan, and the price of meat is extremely high, requiring six or seven jiao per catty. The Meat Industry Association is trying to find ways to dredge the source, but it is still subject to various obstacles, and the taxes are heavy. It is feared that the desire to reduce pig prices cannot be achieved.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army is Powerless to Guard Key Waterway Points in Jiangzhe: Now Under the Control of the Chinese Army</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army decided to invade northern Hunan. Prior to this, they transferred a large number of Japanese troops from here, causing the Japanese army's defense zone in the suburbs of Suzhou to become increasingly weak. Although the Japanese army used puppet troops as substitutes, they still felt that the staffing was insufficient, so they had to withdraw the garrison troops from the waterways and organize a mobile-style troop to demonstrate in various places every day, putting on a false show of strength. The Chinese army near Suzhou, aware of their plan, took advantage of their weakness and attacked the Japanese army in Luxu (Wujiang County) on the 25th of last month, cutting off their water communication line, making it impossible for the Japanese army to run rampant on the water, and thereby controlling the Suzhou-Zhejiang waterways. Important strongholds such as Jinze, Shengze, Shuangta, Zhouzhuang, Luxu, and Xinta are now all in the hands of the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese army is afraid that the Chinese army will take advantage of the situation to attack, so they have deployed defenses in the vicinity of this county and transferred a large number of puppet troops to reinforce defenses in Chenmu, Jiaozhi (Wuxian County), Beiguan, and Pingwang (Wujiang County). However, it is heard that the Chinese army's current activities are aimed at controlling the Japanese army's defense zone, so they will not launch a counterattack on any area for the time being. They will wait until the arrangements are in place before launching a large-scale suppression of the Japanese army.</p>

<h3>Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (7): Soviet Russia's Pragmatism</h3>
<p>Since the Communist Party took power in Soviet Russia, it has reversed its old views and seems to have a retaliatory effect on education. Therefore, restrictions are made without sparing effort. Let us first take its universities as an example. Universities under the control of the Soviet government aim to cultivate specialized experts required by the state. The curriculum of each school is formulated by central officials, and Marx's theory is used as a dogma to consistently teach students in order to train them. As for university professors, they must pass a test of their teachings beforehand before they can take office. If there are any reactionary remarks, they will be warned, tried, or even dismissed. The Soviet government treats university professors like this, so one can imagine how it treats primary and secondary school teachers. However, in terms of the active training of primary and secondary school teachers, it can be said that they believe that teachers in communist countries should be pioneers of labor culture, understand communist theory, and have either agricultural or industrial skills. They should be able to hold an axe and use a saw, and be workers of reality. In addition, since they are education workers, joining the labor union and constituting a factor in the Soviet state mechanism, sharing weal and woe with the whole, is of course a necessary condition. In 1931, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decided that all teachers should learn about factory production, Soviet agriculture, collective farm law, handicraft industry law, and the basic knowledge and skills of various machine shops. Of course, this is not enough to be competent. The object of education is children and teenagers. In order to make their nature and environment compatible, they have to devote themselves to hard work education. Therefore, anatomy of students' physiology and biology, as well as child psychology and psychology, are all essential knowledge. In order to fundamentally understand their national system, sociology, especially Marx's philosophical dialectical materialism, should be particularly clear. As for the training of teachers, there are two main places. First, in the last two years of the nine-year secondary school, they are given the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in teaching positions, so that they can be kindergarten, first-level school, and primary political education school teachers. This can be said to focus relatively on ordinary knowledge and skills. The second is educational technical schools, located above seven-year primary schools, and for ten-year schools, they tend to industry or agriculture according to the needs of their locality. There is no other need to compare Japanese and Soviet teacher education. The only special feature is the desire to use a fixed ideal school type to mold their teachers and further mold their people to achieve the same effect by different routes. (End of the full text)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement in Peiping: Two Church Schools Closed</h3>
<p>(Reuters Telegram from Peiping, 6th) The anti-British movement in Peiping has caused two British church schools to close. A Chinese newspaper in this city stated that these schools have closed because the anti-British movement has caused most students to transfer to other schools. The anti-British church movement in various parts of North China has caused almost all British churches in Hebei, Shanxi, and northern Henan to close.</p>
<h3>Measures to Restrict Re-enrollment of Suspended Students in Fujian: Education Department Orders All Middle Schools to Comply</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou News) The Fujian Education Department has formulated measures to restrict the re-enrollment of suspended students in middle schools and instructed all middle schools in the province to comply. The notification states that students in middle schools or normal schools may request suspension for one semester or one academic year due to special circumstances of their bodies or families. This has been clearly stipulated in the revised middle school regulations and the revised normal school regulations. However, since we are currently in a period of resistance against Japan, some suspended students in various schools have been unable to return to school on time due to transportation blockades. This should be slightly changed to make it possible to remedy the situation. Now, special restrictions are formulated in accordance with the regulations and in consideration of the actual situation as follows: (1) The period of suspension requested by students should, as stipulated, be a maximum of one academic year in principle, but if a student is still unable to return to school after the suspension period due to special circumstances, he or she may continue to request suspension for one semester or one academic year. (2) When students who request continued suspension request re-enrollment, they must be subject to a grade placement test, and only after passing the test can they be re-enrolled. (3) Students who do not request continued suspension after the suspension period expires, or who do not re-enroll after the continued suspension period expires, should not be allowed to re-enroll thereafter. (4) Suspension and re-enrollment in vocational schools should be handled in accordance with the preceding regulations. In addition to separate orders, these orders are issued to be followed.</p>

<h3>Finance Quiet Foreign Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in exchange rates or listings. The British exchange in the gray market was exceptionally dull. China's finances have seen repeated new achievements recently, and the financial situation is quite solid. Operators, to avoid failure, have gradually abandoned the means of manipulating the market. Therefore, the impact on the foreign exchange market is only the supply and demand of actual use. However, initially, because Chinese merchants had a slight appetite for buying, and British banks were also active in tracking advantageous opportunities, the morning situation was slightly soft. In the afternoon, due to a cable from Hong Kong and Sassoon's selling, the market once returned to equilibrium. Finally, because HSBC and other banks had good purchasing interest, the result was still slightly soft. British gold was quoted at 4/6/875, and the US dollar closed at 7.50. Because there were fewer arbitrageurs this month, it was slightly closer to the spot price. It was heard that a certain Chinese bank had offered US dollars for November delivery. The entire day's trading was very quiet.</p>
<p>Beneficial Chinese Merchants Still Engaging in Settlements</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large bill and Bank of America prices were flat. London gold remained stable. Exchange rates for the British pound against the US dollar and the French franc were flat. The exchange rate against Shanghai was 25. The US dollar against the British pound shrank by 1.5 points. The exchange rate against Shanghai did not change. The exchange rate against the French franc was 875. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was 4/6/5 for British gold and 7.53125 for US dollars. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was flat and the US dollar was tighter by 03125, due to the exchange rate shrinkage. After opening, the market was quiet and unchanged. When HSBC's listing was announced, there was no movement. When the silver equalization tax was announced, there was no increase or decrease. After that, because Chinese merchants came to settle, and British banks had a good appetite for accepting, only certain HSBC banks and others were still eager to supply. Therefore, although the situation was tight, it was not dramatic. HSBC sold spot British gold to favorable Chinese merchants at 4/6/5 and 4/6/875, and a certain bank sold spot US dollars to favorable Chinese merchants at 7.53125 and 0.50. It was heard that a certain Chinese bank sold US dollars for November delivery to foreign banks at 7.4375. Subsequently, there were fewer transactions, so the process was even more unchanged. Until the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was 4/6/46875 for British gold and 7.50 for US dollars. Compared to the morning opening, the British pound was slightly tighter by 03125, and the US dollar was also slightly softer by 03125.</p>
<p>Sassoon From Hong Kong Sold</p>
<p>In the afternoon, initially, because the Western merchant Sassoon came to sell, and a telegram from Hong Kong reported sales, successively selling spot British gold at 4/6/5 to HSBC and other banks, and spot US dollars at 7.53125 and 5625. This caused the situation to return to equilibrium once. After entering, because HSBC and others still had a good appetite for accepting, and the selling trend had ceased, the state of the market was soft again. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was 4/6/46875 for British gold and 7.50 for US dollars, 4/6/4375 for British gold for this month, 7.4375 for US dollars for this month, 4/6/40625 for British gold for November, and 7.375 for US dollars for November. As a result, compared to the previous day's spot, the British pound was tighter by 03125, and the US dollar was softer by 0625. This month saw no gains or losses.</p>
<p>The British Pound in New York is Relatively Weak Reuters, New York, 5th. Today, in the New York foreign exchange market, the British pound is relatively weak. According to bankers, this is only a reaction to the recent stabilization of the rising trend. Since the beginning of September, the Bank of England has been unwilling to sell British pounds to the United States, but it is rumored that it now intends to sell them, so as not to make the exchange rate high. The prices of other European currencies vary.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market: British Pound Flat, US Dollar Tighter</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 6th. Today's exchange market opened steadily. The British pound was unchanged, and the US dollar spot was tighter by 1875, at 75.25. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 5 yuan, to 330 yuan. At 10:40, the US dollar spot rate loosened by 0625, to 75.3125. At 11:30, it was stable and unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin and Hong Kong Exchange Rates Slightly Lengthened Tianjin, 6th. Today's exchange market opened sluggish. The British exchange spot rate slightly loosened by 0625, to 3/625. The US exchange spot rate lengthened by 125, to 6.1875. The Shanghai exchange rate was unchanged, remaining at 119 yuan. "United Currency" in the gray market was cheaper by 1 yuan, to 85 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rumors Subside Gold Prices Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold bar gray market situation was colorless all day, with very slight fluctuations. The rumors of recent days have subsided, and foreign exchange fluctuations on the day were quite narrow. People's minds were not enough to influence, and buying and selling were not as prosperous as before. The situation turned from weak to firm. The morning opening immediately retreated to 4,050 yuan. Subsequently, because securities firms slightly sold, followed by slow sales, such as scalp trades, there were absolutely no large inflows or outflows. Meanwhile, a certain gold firm took the opportunity to absorb. However, it once fell to a low of 4,040 yuan. Because foreign exchange was soft and Hong Kong firms had a slight appetite for purchasing, the result rebounded to a high of 4,060 yuan. The closing price was 5 yuan higher than yesterday. The ups and downs were ordinary, very suitable for the tastes of general smaller speculators. The entire day's trading was only 700-800 taels, which has indeed returned to the narrow market when gold prices had not soared. Silver shop jewelry gold was unchanged all day, and customs gold was also stable.</p>
<p>Gold Bar Rose 5 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened flat and weak. Initially, twenty taels were sold by money changers to silver shop firms at a price of 4,050 yuan, which was 5 yuan lower than the previous close. After opening, cash gold shops sold thirty taels to money changers, and the price continued to be lowered by 5 yuan, to 4,045 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold firm and money changers raised the price, and it immediately returned to 5 yuan higher. A certain gold firm bought twenty taels from securities firms at a price of 4,050 yuan. Later, because securities firms still had supply intentions, combined with sales from cash gold shops, it fell by another 10 yuan. Cash gold shops sold ten taels to gold firms at a price of 4,040 yuan. After that, it was suddenly heard that foreign exchange was soft, triggering buying interest. For a time, sellers were waiting and watching, and the price jumped 10 yuan. Money changers bought ten taels from silver shop firms at a price of 4,050 yuan. Later, because a certain money changer continued to absorb, and a certain gold firm also had a purchasing appetite, it continued to raise the price by 10 yuan. Money changers mutually traded thirty taels at a price of 4,060 yuan. Near noon, it slightly weakened again. A certain gold firm sold twenty taels back to money changers at 4,055 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the early afternoon, it opened weakly and fell by 5 yuan. Silver shop firms bought twenty taels from money changers at a price of 4,050 yuan. Although foreign exchange slightly turned tight and firm afterwards, a certain money changer had a good appetite for absorbing, so the market reversed and rose. A total of 100 taels were purchased from peers and trading firms at prices of 4,055 yuan and 4,058 yuan. After entering, it was heard that foreign exchange was slightly soft again, so it continued to raise by 2 yuan. Gold firms bought twenty taels from money changers at a price of 4,060 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day had only 20 yuan of ups and downs. The cash gold shops' own-brand gold was sold at 10 yuan higher than the gold bar price, and purchases had to be reduced by about 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>Silver shop jewelry gold was exchanged per tael, because the gold bar price fluctuated very slightly, so it did not change all day. Da Tong Hang still hung 410 yuan. New Tong Hang was the same as the above price, and purchases had to be reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>British Gold Pound Fell the Most</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market was calm. The British gold pound fell by 1.50 yuan, which was the largest drop. The US gold pound also fell by 1 yuan. Philippine notes rose by 0.05 yuan. Japanese gold notes once rose to 1.40 yuan, but eventually retreated to 1.38 yuan. As a result, it still fell by 5%. Korean notes also rose to 1.205 yuan, but ended at 1.19 yuan, still up by 2%. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount and Call Loan Rates All Fixed</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and bills remained at around 70 yuan per thousand yuan, unchanged. The call loan rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 0.19 yuan. The morning and afternoon markets were the same.</p>
<h3>Indian Silver Falls Again British and American Prices Return to Flat</h3>
<p>London, 5th. In the silver market, speculators came and went, and the market was flat. The market was flat after closing, and there were no large transactions. Large bars of silver, both near and far term, were weak. New York Silver: The US spot price was unchanged. Mumbai Silver: The Indian silver market continued to be sluggish. The current and future terms continued to fall sharply by 1 rupee "Anna." The transaction list totaled 60 sheets.</p>
<h3>Securities Active Buyers Domestic Bonds Thriving Foreign Stock Transactions Also Very Prosperous</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities gray market situation showed an increasingly strong trend. Market prices slowly rose without a reversal. People's minds were optimistic and gradually becoming consistent. Since the victory in the Xiangbei battle, its success far exceeded the Battle of Taierzhuang. Morale was extremely encouraged, which had a significant impact. In addition, the visit of the envoy from the invading country to Chongqing was generally considered to be related to the financial aspect. Therefore, buyers were even more active, and they consistently absorbed with the intention of making profits. In addition to covering short positions, they may have turned long. Hongda Liaoyi and others also had considerable absorption. On the selling side, except for Tong Kang Yong Kang Mao Tai and other firms, the rest were scattered retail investors taking profits. Class A has broken through 54 yuan, and Class B has also broken through the 47 yuan mark. The trend should still be a curved upward trend. The market price as a result, continued to rise 0.50 to 0.85 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: fifty shares of the Cotton Yarn Exchange were traded at a price of 39.75 yuan. Suddenly, it rose by another 1 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the Public Works Association reported that yesterday's stock market could be called a big boom day. The volume of transactions in the banking stock sector was rare in the institute. Prices were exceptionally beautiful. Shanghai Silver Company, Yangzi Silver Company, International Trust Company and Jardine Matheson and other stocks rose the most. Other stocks, although not advancing rapidly, were at least able to maintain their original position. Rubber stocks were also more active, and prices slightly improved. But comparing the entire market, it can only be regarded as a background in the painting and still lacks special prominence.</p>
<p>London, 5th. Today's London Stock Exchange listing of British companies' stocks saw a slight increase. HSBC Bank Hong Kong registered shares rose by 1 pound, to 73 pounds. Gula Kirk Rubber shares rebounded by 9 pence, to 16 shillings and 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged. London, 5th. Today, China's foreign debt, still opened with four types of currencies: French, American, etc. The listing market was stable and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Cotton Yarn Merchants Inactive in Procurement Prices Slow and Not Declining</h3>
<p>The yarn market's performance declined, because demand was sluggish. In South China, affected by controlled exchange rates, the merchants were unable to procure. Therefore, transactions were greatly reduced. The general float was large, and due to the poor environment, the thought of unloading spontaneously arose. The chips on the market became more relaxed, and the market was inclined to fall. However, the general well-funded people came to search, maintain, and hoard when prices fell, so the decline was still slow. Judging from the market situation, it will certainly not escape the weak situation. It is difficult to have new posture discovery unless actual needs improve. It has currently fallen to 120 yuan lower than its peak.</p>
<p>The current yarn opened in the morning. Peers gathered together, everyone folded their hands and did not move. It was delayed until 9:50 before the market opened. There were many sellers on the market, and the opening price fell by 10 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse was 740 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 725 yuan. During the middle, it slightly fell by another three or four yuan, but customer sales were still sluggish. Until the close, a portion was slightly dragged in, and it rebounded by four or five yuan. According to half-day transaction statistics, 855 bales were traded. On the 7th, 10 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 55 pieces were shipped to foreign countries. The market price for 20-count Double Horse fell by 11 yuan, Tiannu fell by 8 yuan, and Double Globe fell by 7 yuan. The amount of purchases by each merchant is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Hong Kong 120 Peers 655</p>
<p>Inland 50 Ningbo 20</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Statistics 855</p>
<h3>Active Local Cotton Trading</h3>
<p>Local cotton trading saw another improvement. Yong'an Factory purchased a large amount of white-packaged Hua cotton, estimated at 4,000-5,000 bales, and prices were stable. Other manufacturers have not developed. As for the trading among peers, it was also more active than the previous day. Although the source from northern Jiangsu has not been cut off, transportation along the way is very difficult. Today, there were 1,372 bales of Nantong cotton at the pier. It was heard that the quality of the goods was inferior, and the price was 3-4 yuan cheaper. Goods with bright silk, fine hair, and fine fiber were still reluctant to loosen. 1,040 bales of Changyinsha cotton arrived. On the 7th, 295 pieces of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong. The current cotton selling prices are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Nantong Cotton 157.00 Yong'an Factory Purchased 3,500 Bales Payment Sent to Factory</p>
<p>Changyinsha 162.00 Also Also 1,000 Bales Also Also</p>
<p>Nantong Cotton 149.00 Peer Purchase 200 Bales Also Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Also 147.00 Also Also 400 Bales Also Also</p>
<p>Nantong Packaged 162.00 160.00 Yong'an Factory Purchased 500 Bales Also Sent to Factory</p>
<p>North Taicang 151.00 Peer Purchase 100 Bales Also Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Also Also 152.00 Also Also 100 Bales Also Also</p>
<p>Another message: Foreign cotton trading in Shanghai Port has been very sluggish recently. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude, so the market is unusually quiet. Factories have slightly purchased American cotton orders, but the amount is not large. Japanese factories have also purchased Indian cotton, all of which are immediate loading orders. This batch of Indian cotton can be transported by the middle of next month.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market initially saw cotton prices slightly rise by several pounds due to peer purchases. Later, due to the strong selling of the southern set and the selling of the New Orleans silk merchants on the market, the market turned weak. As a result, the market was very uneven, with rises of 1 pound and falls of 2-3 pounds. Indian Cotton Market: Recently, due to the strengthening of the British and American exchange rates and the relatively stable European political situation, cotton prices have fallen. Yesterday, it fell another 3 rupees. Egyptian rose 10 pounds yesterday and Liverpool fell 1 penny.</p>
<h3>Grain New Rice Arrivals Surge Selling Prices Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>The decline of Japonica rice continued to be fierce, and people's minds were already vacant. In addition to the transportation problems in Changzhou, Wuxi, Songjiang, and other areas, the new goods from various places could be freely transported. Yesterday, it was estimated that 5,000-6,000 bags of goods from Suzhou, Jiaxing, and other places were transported by train, and 3-4 ships of goods arrived from He Xia. There were few local merchants who came to do business, so the merchants frantically sold again to find a way out. However, the result was ultimately ineffective. The total transaction volume was only 4,000-5,000 bags, and the prices of the goods fell by as much as 1-2 yuan to 4-5 yuan. Although the various grades of Japonica rice showed higher prices and final resolutions, the new milled Zhente goods were still expensive because they were not much in the market and it was difficult for buyers to obtain them. However, the middle grades and Suzhou, Tongzhou, Kunshan, and other grades only opened at 35.5 yuan to 35 yuan, a depreciation of about 2 yuan. New Japonica rice was 31.3 yuan. Fengjing Baige initially opened at 30 yuan and closed at 28.9 yuan. Its price drop was the most drastic, reaching 3-4-5 yuan. Songjiang Bo Po, due to lack of goods for a long time, opened at 34-5 yuan. Yangjian Gao was 34 yuan, and the final price was 33 yuan, a depreciation of 2 yuan. Luzhi, however, had fewer arrivals and was quite popular with stores. According to the market, it could have held its ground, but was constrained by other goods, so it also went down 1 yuan. The special opened at 36 yuan, the middle grade at 35.5 yuan to 35 yuan. The customer sharp price was the cheapest. If Jiangbei New Sharp only opened at 30 yuan and 2 jiao, the next opened at 29 yuan and 6-7 jiao. Wuhu Gao pointed at 30 yuan and 05 jiao, and the final price was 29.5 yuan. The sharp was 28-9 yuan, and the yuan was also 1 yuan. Old was 32-3 yuan, and new goods were 30 yuan and 05 jiao to 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Another message: The performance of customer indica rice fell, down a small 1.3 to 1.4 yuan from the previous market. According to the current low price of customer indica rice, the market could have stabilized. The daily sales volume was also more prosperous than japonica rice. However, the new drops have been terrible for days, totaling as much as 10 yuan. Moreover, Japanese merchants secretly sold, and the Jiangbei, Beijing, and Wuhu sources have 3,000-5,000 bags every day, so the market is difficult to support. Yesterday, the highest price of machine-indica rice was only 29 yuan and 057 jiao, and the final price was 29 yuan. Rice was only 28 yuan and 35 jiao, and brown rice was 27-8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Difficult to Save Declining Trend Wheat Arrivals Sparse Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot trading was bland, because the No. 2 flour factory still kept the original price of 7 yuan, unwilling to compete with the low-priced recycled goods. Therefore, factory flour lacked a large number of transactions early on. Recently, local merchants' actual sales have been paying attention to purchasing warehouse receipt goods. Yesterday, Lao Che brand opened at 6.756 yuan, and Bingchuan brand was only sold at 6.7 yuan. The Phoenix brand flour of the Japanese factory was only sold at 6.45 yuan. The selling atmosphere was full in the morning, and its declining trend was difficult to save for a time. The total transaction volume was estimated to be 30,000-40,000 bags. It was heard that in the later market, the customer hoarding side was still trying to hold on because the factory price was not low, so the market felt slightly stable. Today, 9,500 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's trading continued to lack progress. Arrivals were not surging. Holders believed that the European war situation was difficult to be peaceful, and the source of foreign wheat was ultimately difficult to divide. Most of them were waiting on the market for a good price. Chinese and Japanese factories made slight purchases, and hoarders also inquired slightly. As a result, the market was still the same as the previous market. The total market sold 3,500 bags of wheat from Guandian, Suzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, Danyang, and Yangzhou. Except for 2,000 bags purchased by Fu Fu two factories, the rest were purchased by Chemical Industry Society and others.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Sesame Sales Active Yellow Beans Raised and Reduced</h3>
<p>Recently, the miscellaneous grain market has been largely the same, and the market has not changed much. Sesame Guangdong merchants' sales are active, and the current source is still only small tickets, so the market has recovered a lot, and the overall situation continues to be firm. Yesterday, in addition to purchasing 12 bags of Wuhu white sesame in this street (price details in the market price column), Guangdong merchants purchased 100 bags of Danyang white sesame and 200 bags of Hankou sesame. Yellow beans are not taken for export sales in high markets, resulting in a trend of high lows and killing low prices. Yesterday, the market opened 400 bags of Taicang beans, priced from 13.1 yuan to 12.8 yuan, and 75 bags of Jiangbei beans, priced at 14.5 yuan. Today, 460 bags of beans and 250 bags of sesame are shipped to Hong Kong. Another 2,000 pieces of bean cake were shipped to foreign countries.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Prices Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was stable. The association's planned delivery spot was slightly smaller than 55 yuan for 24 coarse white local warehouses. Foreign warehouse goods were initially 54.8 yuan, and later returned to 55 yuan. There was no change in transshipment goods. Taikoo sugar was also initially flat and then tight. East Warehouse B mark was 58.8 yuan to 59.2 jiao, West Warehouse 50 to 9 yuan to 59.5 jiao. The rest of the CW marks and others were returned according to the rules. H mark cart was 43 yuan to 43.2 jiao. The prices of local cotton white and No. 1 ice remained unchanged. The prices of national sugars were slightly looser and still lacked bulk transactions. The goods from the Xinghua store will be opened soon, and the market trend looks soft.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods New South Water Lily Seeds</h3>
<p>Southern Pond Water Lily Seeds: The first batch of scattered goods has arrived in Shanghai. Since the goods have been out of stock for a long time, it feels very light. This street sold more than 200 yuan. The old goods of the pond lily seeds are still sold at the original price, and the market is firm.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Zhen Mei Green Tea Foreign Firms Actively Purchasing</h3>
<p>Yesterday's green tea market continued to be active. The Zhenmei's outgoing route was exceptionally sharp and agile. The pearl tea was also scarce. The Zhenmei of excellent quality was enthusiastically purchased by Tongfu Baolong Yihua Xiehe and other companies. The market price was firm and rose by 12-3 yuan. A total of more than 1,800 boxes of various green teas were traded in the city. The market was stable except for the Zhenmei which saw a rise. The various foreign firms are packing and loading the goods they have purchased. It is heard that a total of more than 8,000 boxes will be loaded next week.</p>
<p>Today, 130 pieces of tea leaves are shipped to Hong Kong, and 50 pieces are shipped to the west.</p>
<h3>Coal Cooked Coal Rose and Then Fell</h3>
<p>The price of cooked coal rose to 80 yuan per ton with coal balls at the end of the previous month. However, due to the easing of coal balls, the cooked coal business was hit hard. It also fell sharply, cutting 6 yuan. Small cooked coal costs 54 yuan per ton, 3.7 yuan per load, or 100 market pounds. Regular customers do not take delivery. As for the selected large pieces, add them according to the price.</p>
<h3>Hardware Freight Expensive Copper Prices Rose Slightly</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions were quiet because prices were high and everyone was afraid to purchase them. The market was silent. However, people's minds were still firm due to the lack of overseas sources. Among them, copper products were produced in the United States and Japan, which are not affected by the European war, so the source has not been cut off, and there are many stocks. However, the freight along the way is expensive, so the market price in Shanghai also increased. Yesterday, TC purple copper blocks were sold at 250 yuan per load, purple copper skins from No. 12 to No. 22 were sold at 260 yuan per load, No. 16 purple copper wire was sold at 260 yuan per unit, and yellow copper strips from 4 points to 1 inch were sold at 230 yuan per load. It is said that No. 12 to No. 20 yellow copper skins were sold at 230 yuan per unit.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods The Demand for Woolen Cloth Retail Stores Has Increased Significantly</h3>
<p>Woolen fabrics have been in great demand recently due to the cool autumn weather, active retail sales of Chinese clothing fabrics, western suits, men's and women's coats, shoes, hats, and accessories. The retail market has been very prosperous and the demand is very hot. Sample shops from the dismantling firms are now selling 2,000 yuan or more of spot transactions every day. Clean water shops in the Qipan Street area are now selling more than 1,500 to 1,600 yuan, and less than 500 to 600 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai West Incident: A Possible Solution Emerges, Municipal Council Attempts to Remove Obstacles, Continued Negotiations Are Only a Matter of Time</h3>
<p>The issue of roads built beyond the Settlement boundaries and the actions of the Japanese and puppet regime fluctuate in intensity. Yesterday, the situation appeared to ease somewhat. The area from Jing'an Temple along Haig Road to Xujiahui, representing the far western boundary of Shanghai West, saw no changes in the immediate situation. However, the far eastern boundary of Shanghai West, around Jiaozhou Road to Connaught Road (Yanping Road), has experienced a series of gangster robberies, leading to a sudden increase in tension. Police searches have shifted from west to east. Throughout the day, a large number of detectives are stationed at key locations, checking pedestrians and vehicles. Six detectives are transported in each vehicle, and two armored cars patrol the area, maintaining strict vigilance. In the Caojiadu (commonly known as Wujiaochang) area, trucks of Japanese military police and puppet police are frequently seen. Armed puppet police patrol in formation. The police patrol teams continue their normal duties, merely exchanging glances when encountering each other on the road. At the guard posts on Great Western Road (Yih Ding Pan Road), Tunsin Road and Columbia Road, Chinese constables have been replaced by Indian constables, maintaining a standoff with the puppet police. Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, met with reporters yesterday morning, stating that the Municipal Council is seeking a solution to the incident with the utmost tolerance, and that continued negotiations are only a matter of time. He also noted that police force in Shanghai West has increased compared to previous years. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Continued Negotiations Will Certainly Take Place</p>
<p>The English "China Press" reports that Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, stated to reporters this morning (the 6th) that the Municipal Council will not automatically concede its rights over roads outside the Settlement. The Municipal Council is constantly striving for patience to avoid any unexpected incidents that may disrupt the situation. This is quite obvious. Mr. Fessenden once again denied that he had held any meetings or negotiations with the "Grand Avenue" authorities after meeting with "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an in the city center a month ago. However, he stated that negotiations would take place sooner or later.</p>
<p>Police Strength in Shanghai West Is Not Weakened</p>
<p>At that time, both sides will have some "give and take" on this matter. The current situation is not what the Municipal Council desires, so the Council is currently trying to remove obstacles. Mr. Fessenden explained the police activities of the Public Concession in the roads outside the Settlement, saying, "Many people believe that the number of constables on the roads outside the Settlement has decreased. The truth is quite the opposite. The police force in these areas is now twice as large as it was before the war in 1937, and the police force in these areas has greatly increased since March 1st."</p>
<p>Negotiations Were Held Before the Shanghai War</p>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that government officials told reporters yesterday (the 5th) that the Municipal Council will certainly attempt to resolve the various issues concerning the roads outside the Shanghai West Settlement. In 1937, the Municipal Council and Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun were about to reach a resolution on various issues in the area, but it was interrupted by the war. However, the current "Municipal Government" does not accept the previous plan, as it stipulates that the Municipal Council should collect taxes from residences and shops on the roads bordering the Settlement.</p>
<p>Someone Is Behind All Actions</p>
<p>Although formal negotiations are currently suspended, on the surface, Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, is consulting with "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an. However, behind Mr. Fessenden, there are other officials seriously considering all aspects of the current situation. And behind "Mayor" Fu, there are also other officials, mostly Japanese "advisors" and soldiers, who present their opinions and demands to the Municipal Council through the "Mayor". Under the instructions of the Japanese, the "Municipal Government's" method of solving the problem is to dispatch ineffective police forces to the roads outside the Settlement.</p>
<p>Temporary Tolerance to Seek a Solution</p>
<p>However, the Municipal Council has not taken such infringing actions. The Municipal Council will certainly not concede its rights in the area, but currently it is determined to tolerate such infringing actions. Even if the Concession police and the "Grand Avenue" police give conflicting traffic signals at the same location, causing disorder, it is now temporarily tolerated. Given the current situation, the Municipal Council can only continue to act to the best of its ability and make every effort to find a solution in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Western School Not Occupied</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Western School on Yuyuan Road was invaded by puppet police on the 3rd, causing great panic among the families of the students. When reporters asked Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Director-General of the Municipal Council, about this the day before yesterday, he said that he was paying close attention to this matter. However, yesterday, Mr. Hailey, the director of the Education Department of the Municipal Council, told reporters that the puppet police did not invade the Municipal Council's Western Girls' School on Yuyuan Road, nor did they invade any other Municipal Council schools.</p>
<h3>Puppet Police Mistakenly Arrest a British Man, Apology Averts Further Action</h3>
<p>British national Walter J. Ward, a well-known athlete working for Reuters, was forcibly taken from his residence at No. 23, Lane 1984, Jing'an Temple Road by puppet police in Shanghai West at around 9:00 p.m. on the 5th, and taken to Great Western Road. His prepared wireless telegraph machine was also taken away. All the details have already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Later, it was learned that after the police received the report of this case, Mr. Dick and Mr. Samson rushed to the location and to the Japanese Military Police Department and made serious representations. Major Asher led a team of British soldiers and accompanied Acting Superintendent Smith to meet with a Japanese major. The Japanese side then stated that it was a mistaken arrest, and released Mr. Ward at 0:15 a.m. yesterday (the 6th) and returned the seized items. According to yesterday's news, Mr. Ward received an apology from the "Grand Avenue Police" soon after his release.</p>
<h3>Tensions Rise in the Southwest Suburbs of Shanghai, Chinese Troops Await Opportunity at the Border of Qingpu and Songjiang Counties, Large Force Approaches Pinghu with Great Momentum</h3>
<p>The situation in the four suburbs of Shanghai has been quite tense for several days. It is reported that guerrilla forces lurking in various counties near the suburbs will take demonstrative actions around the Double Tenth National Day celebration and take the opportunity to attack the Japanese defense zone. Therefore, the Japanese military is engaged in heightened alert. The "Grand Avenue Police" have also been "ordered" by their superiors not to take leave without reason from today, and have assembled in various "departments" to be dispatched at any time. It is said that the Japanese military is most concerned about a part of the southwestern suburbs of the city, because the Chinese troops, whose numbers are unknown, at the border of Qingpu and Songjiang counties may attack the Shanghai city area. Currently, the inspection of civilians entering and leaving various districts in the suburbs is becoming more stringent. No one may forget to carry a "Citizen's Pass," which is like a talisman, otherwise they will encounter unimaginable danger.</p>
<p>Gunfire in Shanghai West</p>
<p>Residents in Shanghai West heard clear machine gun fire late the night before last. Residents in the western district of the French Concession also heard gunfire at around 3:00 a.m. yesterday. Where did this gunfire come from in the middle of the night? It is worth investigating. According to local villagers in Shanghai West, recently regular Chinese troops have moved to the section of the Shanghai-Suzhou Railway along the line. The Japanese troops stationed along the railway have been on high alert recently. This gunfire seems to have been fired by the Japanese military as a demonstration.</p>
<p>Closure of Zha Port</p>
<p>Zha Port, Luhui and Jinhuiqiao towns on the border between Punan and Fengxian were attacked by Japanese military harassment a day ago, according to a Reuters report from this port on the 6th. According to sources at the British Consulate, regarding the arrest and detention of Reuters employee Walter by the Grand Avenue Police at his residence at No. 23, Lane 1948, Jing'an Temple Road last night, two officials from the Shanghai "Special City Government" apologized to British Consul General Phillips this afternoon. British Consul Kitson received them on behalf of the Consul General. The two officials were Lu Ying, Director of the Police Bureau of the Shanghai "Special City Government," and Colonel Igarashi, the chief advisor of the Police Bureau. Lu Ying apologized on behalf of the Shanghai "Special City Government" for the arrest and detention of Walter, and told the British Consul that the Grand Avenue Police entered Walter's residence without knowing that it was the property of a third country, and did not know that he was a British citizen, so they made the arrest. The police responsible for this matter have been punished. Lu Ying also assured the British Consul that such incidents would not happen again, and that they would never interfere with British nationals in the future. Full protection will be given to British residents under the jurisdiction of the Special City Government. They were immediately recovered by the guerrillas. Only Zha Port and Pubei are guarded by Japanese troops, and there are Japanese warships on alert in Puxin. The day before yesterday, a team of Japanese troops explored from Zha Port to the countryside of Luhui and Jinhui, and had a fierce battle with the guerrilla forces of Fan Gen部. The waterway of Zha Port was completely cut off. The Tiancheng Company's ships traveling from Shanghai to Luhui, Xinchang and Jinhui were all blocked outside the port and turned back to Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Captured</p>
<p>Water traffic between Shanghai and Pinghu has been difficult to resume because regular Chinese troops are concentrated in the Xindai area, strictly prohibiting the operation of ships named with the character "丸". Ships traveling from Shanghai to Pinghu only reach Zhujing. Above Zhujing, passengers and goods rely on wooden boats. According to news from the shipping industry, a certain county magistrate of Pinghu County was surrounded by a team of Japanese troops in a certain village because he personally investigated the sufferings of the people in disguise, and was betrayed by traitors. The Japanese troops planned to burn down all the houses and people in the village. The county magistrate, regarding death as homecoming, stepped forward, resulting in his capture, but the houses and villagers were preserved. After the Chinese troops learned of this, they dispatched a large force to approach Pinghu County to rescue him.</p>
<h3>Division of Currency Insufficient, Another 500,000 Yuan to Be Printed, Central Bank Has Contacted Wing On Company, Guild of Tobacco and Exchange Trades Advises Against Hoarding for Profit</h3>
<p>After the issuance of the division of currency notes by the Central Bank, circulation on the market has still not been widespread. Therefore, the price tickets of various companies such as trams, buses, Sincere, Wing On and The Sun have become the only alternative to cash due to actual demand. It is a question as to when this situation will end. The amount of division currency currently issued by the Central Bank is insufficient to meet the needs of the market. Those who hold division currency are driven by curiosity to hoard it and not use it in the market. If this situation cannot be broken, the complexity and disputes of Shanghai division currency substitutes will be difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Hoarding</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Trades Guild, in view of the fact that the division of currency notes has not been widely circulated in the market after issuance, specially sent a letter to its members yesterday, advising them to circulate the division of currency notes and recall the price tickets that have been issued. At the same time, it was publicly announced in the market, "This guild is entrusted by the Central Bank to distribute one-cent and five-cent division currency notes, which have been distributed to all member companies. However, the market has not yet seen widespread circulation. Moreover, this division currency is a legal currency of the country. Citizens should exchange it. In addition to the commission that should be collected, there should be no discount. This guild has sent a letter to its members and hopes to quickly circulate this division currency on the market and recall the issued price tickets. If any hoarding is found in the future, we will report it to the authorities for legal sanctions. Don't say that we are being too harsh then."</p>
<p>Gradual Issuance, Contacting for Continued Printing</p>
<p>After the first batch of division currency notes was issued on the 29th of last month, the Tobacco and Exchange Trades Guild was entrusted to distribute them to various markets. The Central Bank directly exchanged them with various banks and silver shops and adopted a gradual issuance system. Various trade guilds and major companies that need division currency for legitimate reasons can apply directly to the bank by letter. The bank will酌情酌量兑给, depending on the actual number required. The first batch of division currency notes has issued more than 300,000 yuan and will soon be completely issued. The second batch has been contacted by the head office with the Wing On Company in Hong Kong for continued printing. Once agreed, a contract will be signed. It is said that the number is still 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Citizens' Branch of Guild to Collect Division Currency</p>
<p>The 16th district branch of the Xincheng Road Citizens' Union, in view of the fact that various shops have requested to collect division currency notes on their behalf for circulation, sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank yesterday, saying, "To the honored bank, since your bank issued one-cent and five-cent division currency notes, it has been very convenient for industry and commerce. Many member shops of this union now request to collect this division currency on their behalf for circulation. As various shops cannot collect this division currency, there are indeed many difficulties in their business. Therefore, we are writing to inform you that we can collect and distribute it on behalf of the union with funds. We hope that you will investigate and reply."</p>
<h3>European Transport Continues, Silk and Tea Sales Brisk, Foreign Firms Purchase Chinese Silk in Large Quantities, Chinese Tea Sales Unprecedentedly Prosperous</h3>
<p>The sales of Chinese silk and tea to the European market have been particularly prosperous recently, a rare phenomenon since the European war. Prices have also increased. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The external sales of Chinese silk have always been dominated by European countries, occupying an important position in foreign trade goods. Since the outbreak of the European war, foreign firms stationed in Shanghai have stopped placing orders, resulting in a large surplus of silk factories' inventory and a decline in silk prices. Now that most foreign ships have resumed sailing, the transportation of goods to Europe is no longer hindered. Foreign firms in various countries are placing more orders for Chinese silk to prevent the European war from expanding and still be able to operate as usual. They have ordered foreign firms in Shanghai to purchase Chinese silk as much as possible, and large quantities have been shipped to Europe in recent days. The Japanese side is coveting our country's overseas market and is dumping inferior silk at lower prices, implementing an economic encroachment conspiracy. Although Chinese silk has been hit by this, it is still selling very well to European countries due to its excellent quality.</p>
<p>Tea Industry Sources Reveal Prosperous Export Numbers, Chinese Tea exports have European markets as biggest consumer by quantity, followed by the Indonesian archipelago, along with US and Russian territories. Previous European war affairs put a stop to Chinese companies exporting tea to Europe. As shipping has become more available, all backlogged teas have been shipped out of Shanghai, with Jardine Matheson, Union, Ewo, and Jardine Henderson tea firms all back in business. Both red and green teas are being shipped to Europe, with prices ranging from seventy-two or seventy-three yuan to one hundred seventy or eighty yuan. Averages have seen increases of twenty-three yuan to thirty-forty yuan, tea prices and sale numbers are an unprecedented boon post-war. Shipments to the United States and the South Seas are also seeing high numbers, which is an important help to the war-time economy. According to the Municipal Council Health Department's report on the 5th of this month, there are now houses, with a total of 38,819 refugees.</p>
<h3>Japanese National Arrested by Police for Secretly Photographing a News Agency, Clarification Reveals Employee of Continental Times, Three Japanese Nationals Released by Police</h3>
<p>The UK Rapid News Agency, located at No. 316, Times Building, No. 160 Edward Road, suddenly had three Japanese nationals bring a camera to the front of the agency at 6:00 p.m. yesterday, set off magnesium flares, and take pictures of the agency's facade. They were discovered, and an alarm was sounded. A large number of constables were stationed near the Times Building. Hearing the alarm, they rushed to the scene and arrested the three Japanese nationals, but they refused to hand over the film. They were later sent to the police station. According to the three Japanese nationals, they were employees of the Continental Times. The police immediately called the Continental Times to inquire. The newspaper then sent someone to the police station to admit that the three Japanese nationals were employees of the newspaper and stated that the newspaper instructed the three of them to take pictures of the front of the Rapid News Agency. The police asked why they took pictures of the agency's facade. They said that the Rapid News Agency was an anti-Japanese organization and published anti-Japanese news in Chinese and foreign newspapers, so they took this action. The police then asked the Rapid News Agency how to handle this matter. According to the agency officials, as long as they retrieved the film, there would be no other requirements. The employees of the Continental Times spoke in a firm tone and said that if they needed to retrieve the film, they should go to the newspaper in Hongkou. The police considered that the case was not important and released the three Japanese nationals at around 8:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Large Quantities of National Rice Being Transported to Shanghai, Food Panic Subsides, Rice Shops Reduce Rice Purchases, Market Management Committee Standardizes Fees for Businesses</h3>
<p>With sources of national rice decided to be dredged, being transported in a steady stream for Shanghai distribution, the food supply for the entire Shanghai market is gradually stabilizing. Rice prices will soon fall. Transport permits for Wuhu, Suzhou, Changshu, Wuxi and other rice-producing areas will soon be negotiated. Merchants and traders are actively selling. Two or three ships came down the river yesterday. More than a dozen cars of rice and grain were loaded onto trains and transported to Kunshan, Tongli, Jiashan and other places. More than 6,000 bags of new rice were transported by ship. Yesterday, rice prices continued to fall by two or three yuan or three or four yuan. The market trading was sluggish. Buyers watched and waited. A total of more than 5,000 bags were traded in the morning. The Rice Shop Trade Council and the Market Management Committee have recently stipulated that businesses should pay market fees. It has been approved by the 50th decision-making meeting. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sources Dredged, Large Quantities Awaiting Transport</p>
<p>The food panic for the entire Shanghai market has passed. The rice-producing areas have experienced even water supply this year. The late rice is abundant. Sources have been dredged and are awaiting to be transported to Shanghai for distribution by boats and vehicles. It is reported that although taxes and levies have been collected locally, the price per stone is within 20 yuan. Merchants and traders are actively proceeding and negotiating for shipment. At present, the rice and grain shipped from Jiashan and Nangang, Fengjing and other cities and counties along the Shanghai-Jiashan Railway has gradually increased, from more than 5,000 or 6,000 bags per day to more than 10,000 bags. The number of rice purchases by rice shops in Shanghai has been significantly reduced compared to a few months ago. Therefore, the later sales are sluggish, and the inventory will gradually increase month by month. The daily rice demand has decreased. It is reported that the daily rice demand was at least more than 10,000 bags in the past, but now it is only about 7,000 or 8,000 bags. Therefore, it is expected that the food supply for the entire Shanghai market will stabilize, and the hidden worries of citizens have subsided.</p>
<p>Management Committee Stipulates Fee Payments for Businesses</p>
<p>The Rice Shop Trade Council and the Market Management Committee convened the 50th decision-making committee meeting on the 1st of this month to discuss the fee payment methods for businesses in the market. The market has posted the 90th public notice yesterday, saying, "According to the decision of the 50th Market Management Committee meeting on the 1st of this month, due to the increase in various expenses with the trend, the fee payment for businesses has been re-stipulated and listed as follows: (A) 10 yuan per month for each trade. It is stipulated that each trade has a maximum of eight people and may not be increased. (B) 4 yuan per month for each trade without a license. It is stipulated that each trade has four people. If you need to add a license, it is 1 yuan per person per month. (C) 4 yuan per month for each dealer. It is stipulated that each dealer has four people. If you need to add a license, it is 1 yuan per person per month. (D) 1.5 yuan per month per broker. The fees to be paid in each of the above items will be collected starting from this winter. In addition to other notices and separate letters, this public announcement is recorded for public knowledge. This is announced."</p>
<h3>Yih Hua Company's De Yao Ship Detained Yesterday by Japanese and Puppet Regime, Ordered by Puppet Police to Sail to the Fish Market, A Total of 13 Foreign Ships Detained Recently</h3>
<p>The De Yao ship of Yih Hua Shipping Company, which operates between Shanghai and Beisha, was sailing from Qinglong Port to Shanghai yesterday morning with passengers and goods. According to usual practice, it should sail to Pier No. 12, Public Bund for parking. However, when it sailed to the river near Lujiazui, it was detained by the Japanese army and commanded by puppet naval forces. After boarding the ship and asking to review the manifest, without explaining the reason, the ship was detained and ordered to sail to Yangshupu Fish Market. At noon, the Water Police Department of the Japanese Consulate notified the Yih Hua Shipping Company on Guangdong Road of this move, but also did not explain the reason. The company has strongly denied the general speculation that the ship was carrying Chinese guerrillas. According to reporters, the Japanese side has recently detained many small foreign merchant ships, more than 12 coastal ships. They are still forced to anchor outside Wusongkou, causing great damage to the Far East shipping industry of foreign merchants. The detention of the De Yao ship is another record of this incident.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Seek to Force Vaccinations</h3>
<p>According to a recent report in the English China Press, a Japanese language paper reports that the Shanghai Japanese Epidemic Prevention Commission, at a Thursday afternoon meeting at the Japanese General Association Hall, in Penglu, discussed methods of prevention and of shipping vessel inspections before passing a resolution to forcibly vaccinate Japanese nationals, Chinese, and other residents within areas controlled by the puppet regime, in an effort to prevent the spread of smallpox.</p>

<h3>Japanese Forces Withdraw Guard Post From North Jiangxi Road</h3>
<p>The Japanese guard post added at the junction of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu had been withdrawn when reporters visited the area at 5 PM yesterday. Two Japanese soldiers were patrolling the location, holding tools for fixing barbed wire. Local residents also claimed that the puppet railway bureau was set to take control of the Bazilu railway hospital to house refugees, inspiring fear among those refugees.</p>
<h3>After a Order to Settle Foreign Exchange for Exported Goods, Ningbo Cargo Ships Rerouted, Xin Anna to Xinghua, En De to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>After the Zhejiang Customs Office decreed that Shanghai-bound exported goods from Ningbo had to settle using foreign exchange, various industries in Ningbo telegraphed the Finance Department to request a revised order. However, the Finance Department had not yet given any response. Aside from a minority of necessary Shanghai-bound goods, the majority of exported goods were temporarily put on hold. Due to these circumstances, Shanghai-bound goods were drastically reduced, leading to ships on that route being rerouted. The American ship Xin Anna of the Weili Han Company, for example, changed course to Xinghua after returning to Shanghai from Zhenhai the day before. In addition, the China-Italy Company ship En De, which is set to return to Shanghai soon, has made the decision to reroute to Hong Kong starting on the eleventh. The Da Pu, managed by the Norwegian Hua Lun Company, was delayed until 4 PM yesterday, holding over 1000 passengers. The Italian Yihua Company ship Bao Li, after returning to Shanghai on the 3rd, had plans for drydock maintenance, but due to the number of passengers and after inspecting the hull, made the decision to stay in operation as usual and depart today in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppet Regime Desperately Attempts To Control Shanghai-area Land Goods and Fruit, Branch Market Set to Open in Southwestern Shanghai, Small Number of Chinese National Involved</h3>
<p>Regarding the desperate attempt by the Japanese puppet regime to control the city's goods and fruit, this affair is currently proceeding at a breakneck pace. As this reporter knows, the Four Lines Warehouse has been determined as the general market, with locations on Avenue du President Doumer and Hongqiao Rd selected for branch markets in western Shanghai. The side of 16 Pu (Old City) is still pending. Those in the land goods and fruit trade have adopted an extremely firm attitude, watching and awaiting developments. It is said that there is a small number of land goods merchants who are scheming to cut off competition from within. Given that produce is essential to the livelihood of all Shanghai residents, future developments bear scrutiny. The market is rumored to be run jointly by government and merchants, with agreements from the Military Affairs Council, Headquarters of the Garrison, Ministry of Military Affairs, Armies of the Sea and Land, as well as the Puppet City Government.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Declares That It Has Not Sent Members to Sell Goods</h3>
<p>As prices have been rising and allowances have increased in the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, it recently sent a letter to bodies requesting that they continue to solicit donations in accordance with the resolution of the first general meeting of members, on the premise that it does not hinder their operations, in order to provide relief. In addition to asking various organizations to continue soliciting donations, the association has never sent anyone to sell any goods in order to help provide disaster relief. Recently, it has been discovered that someone is selling printing ink to all walks of life, which is obviously an unscrupulous person who is impersonating the association in an attempt to defraud people. In addition to sending letters to all parties concerned, it is hoped that all walks of life will pay attention and not be deceived.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Police Department Rumored to Establish New Japanese Desk</h3>
<p>According to Japanese sources, the Public Concession Municipal Council Police Department established a Special Affairs Desk after the August 13 Incident at the request of the Japanese side. However, the status and authority of the desk were lower than other desks, which the Japanese side considered to be unsatisfactory. Therefore, Akagi, the Japanese Special Deputy Superintendent of the Police Department, negotiated with Bowen, the Superintendent. As a result, the Police Department first abolished the Special Affairs Desk and established the Japanese Desk instead, raising its status and appointing the Japanese Deputy Superintendent Higawara as the chief of the desk. The desk is directly under the Superintendent. The affairs of the desk are still to suppress anti-Japanese elements.</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade Award Ceremony - Thirty-Seven Recipients</h3>
<p>Mainland News reports: The Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade held an award ceremony yesterday (the 5th) at 5:00 PM. Thirty-seven Chinese members of the fire brigade, who have served for 20 to 30 years, were awarded medals by the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, for their dedication to their duties. The award recipients came from the Yangshupu, Hongkou, Central, Xinzha, Yichang Road, and Jing'an Temple fire brigades. Five of them were employees of the fire brigade workshop.</p>
<h3>Bandit Executed in Xiaochuan Shakou</h3>
<p>The bandit Lu A'xiang of Xiaochuan Shakou gathered a gang for robbery and extortion. The villagers feared his tyranny and dared not speak out. Recently, a certain unit of the regular guerrilla force, acting on secret information from the villagers, discovered the bandit's whereabouts. On the 2nd, they completely routed the gang, and the bandit leader Lu A'xiang has been executed by firing squad. The villagers in the surrounding areas celebrated with joy.</p>
<h3>Exemption from Typhoon Tax - High Tide Expected Again in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>The observatory has detected that the chance of typhoons hitting Shanghai in the future has decreased. Starting next month, the entire Chinese coastline will be exempt from the typhoon tax. At that time, domestic astronomical institutions will no longer report on typhoon paths. Furthermore, according to the Shanghai Bureau of Conservancy, a high tide is expected again in the Huangpu River starting from the 13th of this month. Its magnitude will not be less than the current one. This high tide will begin on the 13th and last until the 18th. The highest level will reach 12 feet 2 inches, and the lowest will be 10 feet 05 inches. Considering that the height of the Bund waterfront of the Huangpu River is only 13 feet, the water level will be very close to the shore, which is worth noting. In addition, the river current will be particularly turbulent during the high tide, so those navigating ships should also pay attention.</p>
<h3>Major Shanghai Stores Hold Charity Bazaar to Aid Afflicted Chinese - Market Set Up at the British Girls' School on Haig Road Starting This Afternoon at 2:30 PM, Proceeds to Benefit the Renji Benevolent Society</h3>
<p>Today (October 7th) at 1:30 PM, a charity bazaar to aid the poor and sick will be held at the British Girls' School, 425 Haig Road. All profits will be donated to the Renji Hospital Women's Auxiliary Society.</p>
<p>Those who participated in the Society's first charity bazaar on October 15th of last year will surely remember the lively scene. It is said that the total income reached over three thousand Chinese dollars. More than one thousand dollars have already been used to help outpatients, and the remaining two-thirds have been used to purchase handicraft materials for inpatients and to compensate the social workers specially hired by the Society.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, and The Sun department stores, as well as the Wing On Textile Factory, the Majestic Hotel, Keseling Western Restaurant, Sullivan Confectionery Company, and others, recognizing the Society's excellent achievements and admirable intentions, have specially donated large quantities of snacks, candies, toys, food, and clothing to be displayed at the charity market, allowing people from all walks of life to choose and buy at will. The handicrafts made by members and patients will also be sold at the market. Therefore, compassionate gentlemen, ladies, and young people should take their children, younger siblings, and cousins ​​to stroll around there. If you get tired, you can sit down for refreshments and listen to a speech by Lady Missup, the wife of the British Assessor. Fortunately, there are many things to see and buy, so feel free to take your time and choose as much as you like. When you go home, you will be "fully loaded," and your heart will be full of joy, because "doing good is the greatest joy."</p>
<p>The Renji Hospital Women's Auxiliary Society has only been established for over two years. Speaking of the Society's founding, there is a history worth recounting. Recalling when the sounds of cannons were heard in the suburbs, two tragedies occurred in succession: one in front of the Great World entertainment center and the other in the bustling Nanjing Road. At that time, the hospitals in Shanghai really could not accommodate so many injured people. However, hospitals are, after all, hospitals. They cannot, like theaters, put up a sign saying "Full House Today, Please Come Early Tomorrow." So they had no choice but to accept everyone. However, it was impossible in reality to allow "those who come" to lie in hospital beds and enjoy the usual treatment of patients. Therefore, the tragic situation was truly beyond description. At this time, many British women, without prior arrangement, went to Renji Hospital to share the volunteer nursing work and, in the spirit of humanity, justice, and compassion, did their best to help the afflicted Chinese. Later, because of their shared goals, they formally established the Auxiliary Society. As a result, the scope of service expanded day by day, the effectiveness of the work became more and more apparent, and the strength of the group gradually became evident.</p>
<p>In the beginning, all the members were Westerners. Later, Chinese women, not wanting to be left behind in doing good deeds, enthusiastically joined one after another. This made the work progress more smoothly, and there were no language difficulties between the staff and the patients. When the Chinese army withdrew west, Shanghai immediately became an "isolated island." However, the Society continued to relieve the suffering of others in accordance with its original intention of serving the community. They all knew that what patients needed was not only medical treatment but also compassion and understanding.</p>
<p>These "living Guanyins" with the heart of a Bodhisattva - the members of the Auxiliary Society - not only do their best to fulfill their obligations, but also have to pay out of their own pockets. Not to mention anything else, just the membership fee alone costs five dollars a year. However, if you want to contribute more, then paying one dollar is enough, because the principle of "money for money, effort for effort" applies here as well. Under the leadership of Chairperson Ms. Liu Wu Zhuosheng and Vice-Chairpersons Madam Ni and Mrs. F.W. Poate, the Society's affairs have made significant progress. Speaking of Chairperson Liu, many people must know her, and the students who have been taught by her must be able to recall her patient and guiding style. As for other responsible personnel, they are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairperson of the Occupational Therapy Committee: Mrs. H. Maxted. English Secretary: Ms. Yin (Mrs. Bernard Read). Chinese Secretary: Mrs. Zhang Yongquan. Treasurer: Mrs. Hou Xiangchuan. Library Committee Member: Ms. Wang Xin'en. Chairperson of the Infant Care Committee: Ms. Chen Jingling, Madam Pan. Chairperson of the Clothing and Fabric Committee: Madam Xu, Vice-Chairpersons Mrs. W.M. McLennan, Mrs. P. Farqubatson. Chairperson of the Visitation Committee: Mrs. G. Fubdkay Andrew. Chairperson of the Children's Toy Committee: Mrs. H.G. Stock. Western Publicist: Miss E. Adiam. Chinese Publicist: Ms. Wang Peizhen. Hospital Representative Nurse: Miss Tayler. Member Representative: Ms. Zheng Shengzu Xin (Director of the Women's College of Shanghai University).</p>
<p>After reading the above list, you can understand the general outline of the Society's work. However, it still seems necessary to add a brief explanation here. For example, the term "occupational therapy" is still very new in China. Its purpose is very simple: to relieve the monotony of life for patients during the healing period; as for obtaining the cost of light manual labor after the patient recovers to supplement daily living expenses, that is secondary. The books and magazines provided by the Society's Library Committee rely entirely on the generous donations of people from all walks of life. Patients can borrow them to read, which can pass the time, relieve boredom, and increase knowledge, and the benefits are considerable. The two committees for children's toys and clothing and fabric are dedicated to soliciting broken clothes, old clothes, and dolls, etc., and then mending and repairing them before distributing them to patients. In addition to asking people to sponsor infants, the Infant Care Committee also manages the affairs of protecting discharged women and children.</p>
<p>It is said that once upon a time, a minor girl who looked like a maid was accompanied by her mistress to the hospital to give birth. The child born soon died, and this "poor Qiu Xiang" then returned to her master's home. The master was the one who raped her and made her pregnant. Therefore, the wife could not help but feel a little jealous of her; now seeing her return, she naturally regarded her as a thorn in her side and constantly abused her. One night, just when the northwest wind was blowing very hard, she actually got her drunk on strong liquor and pushed her out into the dark street outside the wall, preparing to let her freeze to death alive. At that time, she was only thirteen years old.</p>
<p>But that traumatized mind was still able to recall the two words "Renji." Because only at "Renji" had she received comfort and pity. In a semi-numb state, she vaguely uttered the sounds "Renji, Renji." Passersby, hearing the sound and seeing the situation, could not help but feel compassion and brought her to the place she mentioned. When she arrived there, she gradually woke up and knew that no one would beat her or scold her anymore, and that she could not go back to the master's house. So she revealed all the facts. Afterwards, the Auxiliary Society sent her to the "Gate of Hope" - the Jiliang Institute - to receive education and protection with other women who had escaped the pit of fire. The police authorities filed a public lawsuit against the master and his wife. As a result, the court punished the mistress with the crime she deserved and sentenced the master to 18 months in prison. Such cases are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>This kind of social service work is worthy of promotion and implementation, and tomorrow's charity bazaar is also "worthy" of taking a look and buying something. Now, the organizing staff are "working hard" to make sure that everyone, adults and children alike, leaves with a smile. How do I know? There is a work distribution table for the preparatory committee as proof. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lottery, Patient Handicrafts - Mrs. Maxted. (2) Performances, Sweets - Mrs. Frederick. (3) Refreshments - Mrs. Young. (4) Children's Supplies - Mrs. Beynon. (5) Chinese Goods - Mrs. Huang Zhenqiu. (6) Household Goods - Mrs. Poate. (7) "Fishing" Game - Mrs. Gorlovsky. (8) Homemade Products (such as peanut butter, fruit jam, etc.) - Mrs. Read.</p>

<h3>Detailed Account of the Parricide Case: The Father's Violent and Cruel Nature Abused His Wife - Two Sons Secretly Conspired to Put Him to Death - Infused Electric Current and Then Dismembered the Body - The Daughter Discovered It and Secretly Reported It to the Police for Arrest</h3>
<p>Ten years ago, in the Shanghai International Settlement, a case occurred in which an unmarried woman named Zhang Wenqing killed her stepmother. It caused a sensation at the time. Later, Ms. Zhang was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment and is still serving her sentence in the women's prison of the First Special Court. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 5th of this month, a case of sons killing their father occurred in Haig Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. A brief account was published in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Zhou Yongjie</p>
<p>Was a native of Ningbo, and was of an age nearing knowing one's destiny. He used to be the manager of a Sino-French pharmacy in the Northeast, and was skilled in business and had some savings in his hands. Later, due to old age, he retired and came to Shanghai to live as a gentleman. He built a house at 228 and a half Haig Road. The house was a three-story Chinese-style building, where he lived with his wife, Ms. Jing (48 years old, from Shanghai), his eldest son, Qinji (28 years old), his younger son, Qinxiang (21 years old), and his eldest daughter, Qinzhu (25 years old, still unmarried). However, Zhou Yongjie was quite violent and stubborn, which led to a weak relationship between husband, wife, children. Zhou's wife, Ms. Jing, had heart disease, and Zhou</p>
<p>Treated Her Even Worse.</p>
<p>Verbal abuse and mutual beatings were often heard. On one occasion, Zhou severely beat his wife and then evicted her. After two or three weeks, although she was persuaded to return, Zhou was still angry and did not speak to her. Every midnight, he would make excuses to yell loudly, non-stop until dawn. All of this was deliberately done to oppose his wife, intending to make her leave the world early. His two sons, Qinji and Qinxiang, witnessed their mother suffering and tried to dissuade him, but he turned his anger on his two sons, cut off their financial support, and did not allow them to study (because Qinxiang is currently studying at Datong School in Pudong). Qinji and others thought that their father's</p>
<p>Situation Had Changed Greatly.</p>
<p>If this continued, they feared that their mother's life would be in danger. In order to strike first, Qinxiang initiated the plan to kill their father. From then on, the two brothers often used the Gujiazhai Garden in the French Concession as a place for secret meetings. After several discussions, on the 4th of this month, they decided to take action. They purchased wires, electric light bulbs, a saw, screws, and a drill, preparing to electrocute their father and then dismember the body to destroy the evidence. After the materials were prepared, they returned home without saying a word and had dinner together as usual, sleeping in separate rooms. At around 1:00 AM on the 5th, Qinxiang got up and woke up Qinji, and they</p>
<p>Sneaked Into Their Father's Room.</p>
<p>Using the bulb to connect the electric current, they separately touched his head and feet. Zhou Yongjie died unknowingly. They moved the body to the balcony and went out to buy a bottle of sulfuric acid and two bottles of nitric acid, and a wooden box. They returned home to carry out the dismemberment. First, they cut off his head and placed it in a bucket. Then, they sawed off his legs, wrapped them in towels, and placed them next to the body. Unexpectedly, while they were dismembering the body, their sister, Qinzhu, learned of the situation. Believing that her brothers' actions were inhumane, she secretly reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detectives Zhu Jihuang, Liang Junshan, Wu Qilan, and Western detectives to</p>
<p>Investigate.</p>
<p>They saw Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang carrying out the dismemberment work. They arrested them, along with the corpse, Zhou's wife Ms. Zhou Jing, and the wires, bulbs, saws, screws, drills, and other items, and took them all to the police station, where they were detained separately. The body of Zhou Shui-jie was taken to the mortuary. Yesterday morning, the police sent Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang to the mortuary for questioning and took Zhou Jing to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court, where they charged them with the crime of killing a direct ascendant relative in accordance with Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The police lawyer Wang Shoutang detailed the above situation and requested a postponement. Ms. Zhou Jing testified that her husband had</p>
<p>Abused Her Severely.</p>
<p>However, regarding the point of conspiring to commit murder, she claimed that she did not know about it beforehand, and although she knew about it after the death, she did not participate in the dismemberment work because she was frightened and fainted. Judge Chuan Lin ordered her to be detained pending further investigation, and postponed the hearing for seven days to investigate and verify the facts. The prosecutor's office sent a prosecutor to the scene to verify that the body was indeed killed. The body was handed over to the family for burial, and the murderers were detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Signboard Blown Down by Typhoon - Kills a Person - Shop Owner Sentenced to One Year in Prison</h3>
<p>On the morning of August 30th of this year, when a typhoon hit Shanghai, a horizontal signboard installed above the gate of the Kyoto Catering Company at 983 Avenue Joffre, due to years of disrepair and corrosion of the iron hooks, was blown down by the wind. A woman surnamed Wang Chen, a native of Ningbo, happened to be passing by and was struck in the head and died before she could be treated. At the same time, another pedestrian was also injured in the head and went to the hospital for treatment and recovered. Now, the French police have found that Lin Weirong, the owner of the Kyoto Catering Company, a native of Ningbo, did not pay attention to it beforehand. On the 1st of this month, Lin Weirong was sent to the Second Special Court, where the French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution against him for the crime of causing death by negligence. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated him and ordered Lin to be released on bail pending further investigation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang opened the court again for a continued hearing. The defendant Lin Weirong did not appear, but his defense lawyer and the witness, a painter named Chen Tingsheng, appeared in court and testified that the signboard had been repaired two years ago, but it had been installed for twelve years. It was indeed blown down by a strong wind. The court verified the testimony and ordered the debate to be opened. Believing that the defendant had indeed been negligent in preventing it beforehand and should bear responsibility, it announced the end of the debate and sentenced Lin Weirong to one year of imprisonment for causing death by negligence. The defendant was detained in the detention center pending the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Forcing Good Women Into Prostitution - Two Criminals Detained Pending Sentencing</h3>
<p>Wang Boqing, who opened a brothel at 143, Lane 1, 14, Yunnan Road, usually colluded with his concubine Tang Lingmei to go out under the guise of helping others to entice good women to work as prostitutes. Recently, Tang Lingmei was hired by Fei Songsheng, a native of Huzhou, at 4, Jiande Lane, Yu Yuan Road. On the nth day of last month, she designed to entice Fei's seventeen-year-old niece, Fei Huamei, and Fei's relative, Li Jufang (also seventeen years old), to go out and abscond together. The two women were lured to a small inn that night and raped by Wang Boqing one after another. Then, they were taken to his brothel and forced to receive guests at the Great World entertainment center. After the case occurred, detectives Liang Junshan from the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested Xu Jingan, Zhang Hua, Wang Peifang, Zhao Xiaonan, Yang Shunquan, Tang Yunsheng, and other suspects. Fei and Li were rescued, and a seventeen-year-old girl named Li Suzhen was also brought to the police station. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the court continued the interrogation. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that Wang Peifang and Tang Yunsheng had been arrested for selling, enticing, and forcing good women into prostitution, but the others were not involved. He requested their release. After the judge interrogated them, Wang and Tang were ordered to be detained pending sentencing. Xu Jingan, Zhang Hua, Zhao Xiaonan, and Yang Shunquan were released. Fei and Li were handed over to their families to be taken back. Li Suzhen was temporarily kept at the Jiliang Institute.</p>
<h3>Excavating Ancestral Graves - Ruling to Suspend Trial - First Confirm Ownership</h3>
<p>Su Langqing, a native of Lijiazhai, Leishangda Road, French Concession, sixty-six years old, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Li Shihua, who lived in the same house, and his clansmen Su Fusheng, Li Guoxiang, Li Guanlin, Li Xiangqi, and Li Jinchang, and other six people, of excavating ancestral graves. He requested an investigation and attached a civil lawsuit to recover the remains of his ancestors. According to the complaint, the plaintiff's seventh-generation ancestor sold one mu and four fen of land in the 28th Bao, 12th Jia, north of Zhaozhu Road to Li Shihua's ancestor during the Xianfeng years, and there were four ancestral graves on the land. There was a deed of sale, which has been more than eighty years. On August 20th of this year, Li Shihua suddenly hired Su Fusheng and the other defendants to excavate the graves without permission. The plaintiff learned of this and reported it to the Beitang Road Police Station, but the prevention was ineffective. He requested an investigation and recovery of the bones of his ancestors. According to the complaint, the court, at 3:00 PM yesterday, opened a trial by Judge Sun Penghan. The defendants hired lawyers such as Wang Shouan to defend them. The plaintiff only claimed that the ancestral graves were excavated, but failed to provide sufficient evidence. The defendant Li Shihua testified that the land was passed down from his ancestors, and the graves were the Su family's. This time, he sold the land and ordered the owner, Su Fushun's son Su Menggen, to move it away. Su Fusheng testified that the graves contained his ancestors. His son established his will and ordered his son to relocate the burial, and it had nothing to do with the plaintiff. The plaintiff's land was to the south. After interrogating the other defendants, the court held that the two sides had their own opinions, but the plaintiff did not provide any evidence. It was ruled that the trial be suspended, and the two parties were ordered to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court to confirm the ownership of the graves before proceeding with the trial.</p>
<h3>Male and Female Drug Traffickers - Sentenced to Fifteen Years Each</h3>
<p>Hua Detective Ye Yusi, Detective Li Shugui, etc. of the Public Concession Narcotics Division, previously cracked down on an illegal heroin sales organization at 221-223 Beihai Road, arresting Jin Ziqing, Xu A'er, women Wang Li, and Li An, and other four criminals, confiscating eighty-three taels of heroin, one hundred taels of raw materials, glucose, cocoa powder, alcohol, and smoking paraphernalia, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao ascended the bench in the First Criminal Division and announced the verdict: Jin Ziqing and Wang Li were jointly selling drugs and were sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment each. Xu A'er and Li An were acquitted. The confiscated heroin and other drugs were confiscated according to the list. Zhou Heshang, a fishmonger from Dachang, 32 years old, usually sold his goods at a higher price, which was envied by other colleagues in the Datong Road vegetable market. Yesterday morning at about 8:00, when Zhou took fish and shrimp to the vegetable market for sale, his colleagues firmly refused to allow him to sell separately and beat Zhou, causing injuries to his abdomen. After the Chinese police intervened, Zhou was seriously injured and was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. At 8:15, he arrived at the hospital, but due to injuries to his stomach, he died at 9:10 before he could be treated. The police searched for the murderers at the scene of the incident and arrested one fishmonger, who was detained pending interrogation. Zhou's body was sent to the mortuary for examination.</p>
<h3>Case of Postal Worker Forcibly Transferred - Expected to be Resolved Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>Chen Daquan, the leader of the Undeliverable Mail Group of the Shanghai Post Office, transferred postal worker Chen Guoxian out of personal spite, which aroused the indignation of all postal workers, who collectively requested the authorities to investigate thoroughly. The matter has been reported in the previous newspapers. It is now heard that senior postal officials also believe that Chen Daquan may have been venting his personal grievances. To avoid further escalation, they came forward to mediate and asked the authorities to withdraw the order to transfer Chen Guoxian to Chongqing and asked Chen Daquan to personally apologize to all postal workers. A storm is expected to be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Police - Searching for Flower Club Gambling Den - Gambler Jiang A'bao and Others Fled and Have Not Been Captured</h3>
<p>Flower club gambling is extremely harmful. Recently, flower club gambling has been rampant in Hongkou. Jiang Asheng, Wai Tou Bao Lin, Wang Abaod, Yu Deli and others openly set up a public gambling den at No. 10, Baoan Lane, Haining Road, gathering people for profit. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret, and the Public Concession Police learned of it yesterday. They dispatched a large number of detectives to search and arrest them. Unexpectedly, Jiang and others had already escaped without a trace. The police are now strictly hunting them down.</p>
<h3>Railways Being Built in the City Center - Military Equipment Being Implemented - Approximately 60,000 Square Meters of Muslim Cemetery in Zhenru Occupied - Muslims Plan to Telegraph Japanese Muslims to Uphold Justice</h3>
<p>Since the Battle of Shanghai, in order to achieve long-term occupation, the Japanese have been implementing various military equipment in the city center. In order to expand traffic and facilitate transportation, they plan to build a railway in Zhenru, directly reaching Baoshan, Wusong, Jiangwan and other places. The Shanghai Muslim Cemetery and the Public Land of the Cattle Industry Association, near Zhenru Station, have been included in the railway line, occupying 60,000 square meters of farmland. The Japanese have notified the gravediggers there, ordering them to relocate the graves, arousing the anger of all</p>
<p>Muslims.</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency, after receiving the news, the Executive Committee of the Muslim Church sent people to Zhenru to inspect the site. They saw that the Japanese had built a model station building and had also set up route markers. Observing the situation, it seemed that they would officially start construction soon. Yesterday, they visited the person in charge of the Muslim community, who said that regarding the Japanese occupation of the Zhenru cemetery and the order to relocate the graves, they had convened an emergency meeting of Muslim representatives and decided to argue with reason. Because according to</p>
<p>Muslim Religious Regulations,</p>
<p>After a believer dies, his body is placed in a bottomless coffin and buried in the ground. Therefore, after a long time, the remains have assimilated with the soil. If one wants to relocate the grave and re-examine the bones, it is difficult and impossible in fact. Therefore, they have sent people to negotiate with the Japanese, requesting a change in the railway route to preserve the current state of the cemetery. If no result is obtained, they will telegram Japanese Muslims to uphold justice and request them to find a way to stop the Japanese military to avoid the Muslim cemetery from suffering misfortune.</p>
<h3>Change of Rent to U.S. Dollars, Denial of Lease Termination: Tenant Mrs. Taylor Loses Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Mrs. Taylor leased two houses at 433-435 Great Western Road from Li (i.e., Li Dingshu, 34 years old, from Hefei) on April 1st of this year. The rent was 175 yuan per month, and the lease was for one and a half years, expiring on October 1st of next year. Recently, Li notified Mrs. Taylor that due to foreign exchange issues, the rent of 175 yuan must be paid in U.S. dollars, otherwise the lease would be terminated immediately. Mrs. Taylor then filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Special Court, accusing landlord Li Dingshu of seeking a judgment that the lease contract was valid and that the lease could not be terminated. After reviewing the case, the court found that Article 6 of the contract stated that if Party A (the landlord) wished to terminate the lease of the premises rented by Party B (the tenant) midway, they must give one month's notice, and thus the contract could be terminated according to law. Therefore, the court ruled against Mrs. Taylor. Mrs. Taylor was dissatisfied and retained lawyer Zhou Fu to appeal to the High Second Branch Court. The hearing has already concluded, and Judge Xia Xiong ruled yesterday that Mrs. Taylor's appeal against Li Dingshu's request to prevent the termination of the lease contract was "dismissed." The appellant shall bear the costs of the litigation. If she is not satisfied with the judgment of this court, she may still appeal to the Supreme Court according to law.</p>
<h3>Result of Lottery Gambling: Woman Swallows Opium and Attempts Suicide, Mrs. Xu Wang in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>Mrs. Xu Wang, a woman from Minhang, 24 years old, residing at No. 10 Juxiang Road, French Concession, suddenly swallowed a large amount of opium yesterday morning in an attempt to commit suicide. Her family discovered her and rushed her to the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for treatment. It is reported that she is deeply poisoned and in critical condition. As for the reason for her suicide, it is said that she was addicted to lottery gambling and lost all her money and clothing. Feeling ashamed to face her family, she attempted to end her life.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Upon reading the news column in your esteemed newspaper yesterday, which stated that over a hundred Japanese soldiers and police officers in trucks arrived at No. 99 Great Western Road, occupied the houses, and forcibly evicted all the residents, while the Third Shelter of the Cilian Branch attached to the interior was not interfered with and is now guarded by military police, with a side door opened for refugees to enter and exit, we were greatly surprised. While it is true that the police from the Great Western Road police station came to investigate our shelter, the aforementioned events did not occur. We fear that the report is based on inaccurate rumors. Therefore, we are writing to your newspaper to request that you investigate the matter.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Third Shelter of the Cilian Branch</p>
<p>October 6th</p>

<h3>Losing More Than You Gain</h3>
<p>— Pei Chu</p>
<p>The era when European countries seized colonies from less developed regions outside Europe, returned laden with riches, and enjoyed them at will is over and will never return. There are two reasons: first, some less developed countries are striving to become strong and seeking progress, making other countries hesitant to invade them lightly; second, all the land that could be divided has already been divided and belongs to someone, and there is nothing left for any upstart to covet. The result of this shift in the situation is not a sudden act that happens overnight, so trying to change this situation is not something that can be achieved by violence in a day or two.</p>
<p>Some upstarts stubbornly refuse to believe this principle and insist on copying the old tricks of the great powers of the past, using imperialistic methods to stir up trouble and plunder from east to west. As a result, they either gain nothing or lose more than they gain, which is worse than gaining nothing and results in great losses. Japan is an "original sinner," the first to invade China, and is now trapped in a quagmire from which it cannot extricate itself. As long as China continues to resist, the outcome is predictable. Italy's invasion of Abyssinia required great effort and cost an unknown amount of energy, but all it gained was a rocky field. And this rocky field is now growing thorns, preventing them from living there in peace, and forcing them to seek help from Emperor Selassie of Abyssinia. Finally, there is Germany, which is now the focus of everyone's attention. What did it gain by destroying Czechoslovakia and Poland?</p>
<p>Since nationalism replaced statism, everyone knows that no strong country can destroy any small, individual nation. Just as Czechoslovakia and Poland were able to restore their countries in the past, they will naturally be able to do so again in the future. Therefore, what Germany gains at present will ultimately be lost in the future. And even in the present, even if we say that Czechoslovakia and Poland, especially Poland recently, can be temporarily gained by Germany, what Germany loses is far greater than what it gains. This is not a loss of Germany's military strength or material resources, nor is it a loss of manpower, but a loss of the hearts of the people, a loss that is greatest and cannot be compensated! What is this? It is that the people of Nazi Germany can henceforth freely absorb communist ideas. Given that Germany is a country that is most suitable for the development of communism, a first-class industrial power, and an extremely poor country, the overthrow of the Nazi government is inevitable and rapid.</p>
<p>Doesn't Germany, like Italy and Japan, know the consequences? Why do they still do such things that lose more than they gain and result in great losses? If you say they are stupid, they will naturally not admit it, but if you say they are wrong, even if they do not admit it, it is always an undeniable fact. In addition to the thought of greed, they have also added some vanity, so they are now in a dilemma and will eventually fall into an unbearable situation. What is called vanity is that they think they are a first-class power and must have a vast territory and acquire some colonies to decorate their facade. This is simply ridiculous, but they are precisely so concerned with saving face!</p>
<p>The ruling classes of these countries, fearing their own decline and inability to continue ruling, have no choice but to develop outward in order to maintain their position, so they have to use various pretexts to invade other countries. This is also a very valid reason. However, even if they calculate that their aggression will gradually succeed, and their own position can still be maintained through gradual effort, the success of aggression has limits, while the maintenance of position has no limits. In the future, they will still perish, lose more than they gain, no, lose greatly! Originally, their ruling method, fascism, is fundamentally wrong and incurable. Let us see, all the present tricks are about to come!</p>
<h3>From "Bei-jing"</h3>
<p>— Senior Brother</p>
<p>A friend came from "Bei-jing." After I accompanied him to appreciate the extravagance of Shanghai, it was already dusk. So we decided to "feed our brains." He was afraid he wouldn't be used to Southern cuisine, so I specially found a Tianjin restaurant. As soon as we entered, we heard a familiar Tianjin accent.</p>
<p>"Eat somethin'? You, eh?" It was that professional smile again.</p>
<p>We casually ordered a few dishes, and of course we also wanted to drink some wine. "What kinda wine? You, eh? Jia Pi? Bai Gan?..."</p>
<p>After drinking a glass of Bai Gan, my friend's face became flushed, and he naturally talked even more.</p>
<p>"Old Han, tell me some stories from 'Jing'!" I finally brought up the request that I hadn't had time to talk about all day.</p>
<p>My friend frowned, quietly ate two bites of food, and frowned with a red face as if he were thinking. Suddenly, out of nowhere, he began: "Now there are no unemployed people on the streets of Bei-jing!"</p>
<p>I listened attentively. I ate and drank while nodding and raising my head to show understanding and ask questions. Now I raised my head suspiciously, with a big "?" on my face.</p>
<p>"Do you want to know why? Because—because people without jobs are not allowed to stay in 'Bei-jing'!"</p>
<p>"Among the unemployed vagrants, there are bound to be some 'bad elements.' Usually, they can't be as law-abiding as employed 'citizens.' If there are no unemployed vagrants among the citizens, wouldn't the world be at peace! So everyone in 'Bei-jing' must have a job—of course I also have my job, I am an honorary accountant for a familiar shop."</p>
<p>"But this has made it difficult for those college students who are 'recuperating' in Bei-ping. Where can they find a job? ———— But college students have received higher education after all, and they can come up with ideas on the spur of the moment. They pooled some money and opened coffee shops. The money spent was limited, but the job was found. They even made a fortune. So now there are quite a few coffee shops opened in front of several universities. The shops are quite nicely decorated and have waitresses. Business is of course booming, and most of the customers are college students. ——— Black coffee, red lips, distinct colors, I guess this is what is called stimulation?"</p>
<p>"It is said that one opened in front of the ×× gate, with a capital of one thousand yuan, and after a few months, it has already earned more than two thousand. I hope the owner of this shop studied economics in the past, otherwise, his education —……"</p>
<p>My friend seemed deeply moved, and slowly sipped his wine, his face becoming even more flushed. Seeing that he seemed to want to sigh, I quickly preempted him with a sound: "Alas!——"</p>
<p>"Didn't you write me a few letters a while ago?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Oh, that really brought me a lot of trouble. I was invited to the headquarters of the military police. They asked me what kind of person wrote the letter. Of course, I could only tell the truth: 'A student.' They also asked me 'What is he to you?' I said: 'A cousin. A teenager who is in junior high school.' Fearing that you would cause some trouble, I stuttered and added these two sentences: 'A child, doesn't understand anything.'"</p>
<p>I made a face and stuck out my tongue.</p>
<p>The person who interrogated me was of course also a compatriot. Perhaps seeing that I was so embarrassed, he said: "Okay, it's nothing. ——— But it's best to write fewer letters in the future." Then he lowered his voice in a very friendly manner. After pausing for a while, my friend changed his tone:</p>
<p>"Things in 'Bei-jing' are simply like a tangled mess. I don't want to waste too much brainpower, so let me tell you a little about the situation on the road this time."</p>
<p>"People who are qualified to stay in 'Bei-jing' will not leave easily. It takes a lot of twists and turns to get that 'exit permit.' Every place you go on the road, you will inevitably be questioned. My exit permit was obtained through a friend. I spent some money, so I only waited a few days."</p>
<p>"I didn't have time to study the flood in Tianjin in detail. There, I didn't see any victims, but I saw a few couples sitting in small boats taking pictures." At this point he laughed happily; I also laughed happily, the matter was indeed very funny, we laughed reasonably.</p>
<p>After laughing enough, the conversation continued:</p>
<p>"When I arrived in Yantai, the streets of Yantai were busy drafting soldiers. The draft was very special: blocking both ends of the road, so all the pedestrians on this road were caught. They were taken to the command. If the store came to bail them out, there was still hope of being released: otherwise, you can stay there with peace of mind, and wait for a round number to be collected, and it is said that they will be loaded onto a ship and transported away——I will not drink any more wine. Let's not talk too much, let's eat."</p>
<p>The dishes were gone, and there was not much wine left: it was indeed time to eat. So I shouted: "Hey——!"</p>
<p>My friend was drinking tea, and I couldn't think of anything else to say for a while. Maybe I had drunk too much wine, and my head was a little heavy. Occasionally, I heard a few scattered words floating from the next seat, very beautiful Beijing dialect, but a bit harsh:</p>
<p>"... mutton... hot pot... when will I go back to hot pot..."</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Yun Tian</p>
<p>Theory and practice cannot be separated, writing and action cannot conflict—whether in public or private life, one must be up to "standard." Standard is a level; it's not difficult to achieve, and it can be mentioned in writing; however, one should not place greater importance on beautiful writing (even if one has done one's best in practice), but rather on action. Good writing can be hidden away in a famous mountain, but a bad character will be passed down through the ages. Sakyamuni did not use writing to move people, and his greatness remains undiminished; Yan Song wrote beautiful poems about the mountains and forests, but to this day, people still understand his treacherousness. If you think that these stories are all copied from books and let out a cold laugh, then so be it!</p>
<p>The god of art wept at the symphony of jazz music and the sound of cannons, and she had already smelled the stench of corpses. The culture of the idle has not always been without progressiveness, but now it is retreating to the fire. But let it burn, burn brightly, so as not to fail the suffering Prometheus.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the stench of corpses will be gone.</p>
<p>Someone said, "The strange sounds of 'peng chai peng chai' in the ballroom are the most exquisite. It is the same as Zhuangzi tapping a skull with a horsewhip, hee!"</p>
<p>This person is naturally a literati, very ethereal. But unfortunately, Zhuangzi is only a philosopher, not a re-creator, even if the skull stands up straight and announces the philosophy of "the victory of death."</p>
<p>But the skull seems to have a reason for existence, otherwise Zhuangzi will drag his tail and leave. Haha, abandoned, abandoned, tap, tap!</p>
<p>A cultural warrior has his excellent traditions—courage and integrity; but there is no need to be hypocritical and deliberately straightforward, because the latter will be detrimental to himself. Build good "works" so that the fatal flaw is not seen. Frowning when you hear a hateful laugh is not enough. But never sublimate the essence. If, like Li Bai in front of others, you praise the reign of Kaiyuan as "extracting gold from the sand and mining jade from the stone, all obtaining their essence," it will only make yourself blush, which is the helpless thing of a hanger-on, although in Li Bai's case, it can be forgiven to some extent.</p>
<p>To put it simply: what we do, "in the end" is still not praised by bad guys, or regarded as comrades, but we will not die at their hands either.</p>
<h3>Homeward Journey</h3>

<p>The traces on the clear pond and shallow beach</p>
<p>Further imprinted with layers of mountain peaks.</p>
<p>The water flows, lamenting endless homesickness,</p>
<p>And one gazes endlessly at the smoke and clouds of the northern capital.</p>
<p>The autumn wind plays a high tune with a rustle,</p>
<p>Reeds flutter, full of white hair,</p>
<p>The wild geese in the long sky cry, vaguely still old acquaintances;</p>
<p>Only at first were we hurried companions on the same road,</p>
<p>Today, we greet each other with smiles.</p>
<p>Startling the dogs barking in the desolate village,</p>
<p>One also hears one's own familiar footsteps.</p>
<p>Heavily, the shoulder rubs against a blister</p>
<p>Straw sandals worn through pair after pair.</p>
<p>Strike a match,</p>
<p>Sucking the sooty early tobacco pipe with a sizzle;</p>
<p>In the thick-greased white copper head,</p>
<p>Bright and dark, a red light rises.</p>
<p>Let thoughts sublimate,</p>

<p>There is the dear mother, gazing with her blurry eyes.</p>

<h3>The Birthday of Cinema</h3>
<p>— Pei Pei</p>
<p>Yesterday (October 6th) was the 45th anniversary of the birth of cinema.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that cinema was born in the laboratory of scientists and raised in the accounting office of capitalists. Although it has only been 45 years since its birth, its gestation period was very long, with the first signs appearing as early as 100 years ago.</p>
<p>In 1833, in the 1830s of the 19th century, it appeared on the market in the form of a toy. It first became popular in England, and ten years later, in 1845, it slowly spread to the United States. This toy was called the "Wheel of Life."</p>
<p>It is said that after the "Wheel of Life" was brought to the United States, it enchanted the Americans, and everyone became interested in it, which aroused the research of general scientists on it. The result was the emergence of several imitations such as "Motorscope," "Vitascope," and "Zoatrope."</p>
<p>Based on the improvement and experimentation of these immature machines, Sellers invented a "Kinematoscop" on February 5, 1861. This is the "grandmother of cinema."</p>
<p>On May 14, 1893, Thomas A. Edison invented the "Kinetoscope," which was truly regarded as the "mother of cinema" because it was closer to modern film machinery.</p>
<p>The era when Edison invented the "Kinetoscope" happened to coincide with the "World's Fair" being held in Chicago, and people watched the invention of the great scientist Edison with amazement.</p>
<p>After returning to the United States from Chicago, Edison took the opportunity to live in his hometown for a few days, and then returned to the laboratory where they were studying the invention of cinema.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 6, 1894, Edison had just entered the laboratory when he received a shocking report. This report not only pleased Edison, but also made everyone in the laboratory happy. Because the result of this report was: the experiment of shadow movement was successful.</p>
<p>That night, Edison excitedly gathered the neighbors in the vicinity, without telling them beforehand why he had invited them, and after inviting them into the fifth room, he showed a movie on a white cloth. It was a segment of a dance by a girl named Anna Belle. When the people present saw Anna Belle's dance movements on the white cloth, they were all pleasantly surprised. In this way, October 6, 1894, was designated by them as "the birthday of cinema."</p>

<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>Juarez (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Enterprise</p>
<p>The director's treatment of this historical epic is very meticulous in delineating the two characters, Juarez and Maximilian. For example, Juarez's appearance is shot from the back, and all the shots of Juarez's appearance give the audience a serious feeling, which shows his respect for this historical great man. As for Maximilian, when he went to Mexico, he was told in a few simple scenes that Mexico's beautiful mountains and rivers had been ravaged by invaders, and Juarez's letter pointed out that he was being used. Later, under the leadership of General Baron, he felt the sorrow of being a puppet. The director's description in this regard is extremely delicate.</p>
<p>The two climaxes of Juarez going alone to see Udinan, and the final victory and Maximilian's execution are both tense and moving. (1) Juarez's carriage; sentry reports; the people follow the carriage; Juarez walks face to face in the middle of the firing squad; Udinan stands up after drinking, ... He divides the characters of justice and rebellion very clearly, and the emotional atmosphere is also strong. (2) After Maximilian was arrested, ambassadors from various countries asked for a pardon, but Juarez refused. In prison, the director uses the black shadow of a horse and the sound of a pendulum to transform into Juarez's heartfelt pain. After Maximilian's death, Juarez said in front of his body: "Please forgive me!" The receding lens followed until the end of the play, filled with a strong, desolate atmosphere.</p>
<p>In short, the characters in "Juarez" seem to be jumping in front of us, and the excellent acting skills of the actors and the technical success are all worth recommending to the audience in Shanghai as a great film. (End)</p>

<h3>Love</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>A said, "If you want to find a partner for love, you should go to the ballroom."</p>
<p>B said, "If you can find a partner for love in the ballroom, then you can also find a pure and tranquil Bodhisattva in the stock exchange. The black eyes of the dancers only recognize silver dollars, so how can you talk about love? " It is unknown which of the two is right, let me (44) explain the meaning of the two words "love" and tell you whether it is right or wrong, please correct me.</p>
<p>The word "love" means that the heart receives it. It must be that the heart has a feeling, and love arises spontaneously. This is simple and self-centered. For example, if I say that I love someone or something, no matter who it is, the person or thing that is loved has no right to forbid me to love it. To love is to love, and not to love is not to love. Isn't it very simple and free? But human nature will never just love and be done with it, they must further want to continue to feel, and even want to possess. If you happen to see a cute thing, you love it, you will definitely go back to admire it, and even buy it back and take it as your own. Accordingly, you can imagine that if you fall in love with a person, you will definitely not just love and be done with it, you must go further, even further, and even want to take it as your own. But people are not things after all. If you move a thing from someone else's hand, you can be considered to have possessed it, but people are not that simple. If you possess the shell, without possessing the heart inside the shell, it will show you a terrible...word.</p>
<p>The word "affection" requires reciprocity. I love her, but she doesn't love me, and the condition of love is not established. But from a self-centered perspective, the condition of love is established. So there is only a condition of love between people and things, and there can only be a condition of love between people. This condition of love must be that I love her and she loves me to be considered established. But this...does not stipulate what I must love about her and what she must love about me for the condition of love to be considered established. So generally speaking, in the ballroom, most of the dance guests love the dancers' beauty, and the dancers love the dance guests' money. Since both sides love each other, how can you say that the condition of love is not established? Based on this principle, A's statement cannot be said to be without reason. But to go further, what if the beauty fades? What if the money runs out? In fact, this is needless to say. Since the purpose of love no longer exists, the condition of love will of course disappear. Try flipping through the daily newspapers, which day doesn't have this kind of news? B's statement can be said to have been made in view of this.</p>
<p>I say that the elements of love are definitely not only composed of beauty and money. Even if they are, they are superficial and cannot be maintained for long. Are gold and beauty the only needs in life? So if you want to talk about true love, you have to talk about being able to understand each other's emotions and meet each other's needs. The ancients said, "To die without regret to have found a confidant," but how many people can understand this meaning?</p>

<h3>Extramural Notes: A Proposal for Shanghai to Establish a Theater for the Joint Performance of Kunqu, Qinqiang, Pihuang</h3>
<p>— Xu Yun</p>
<p>Once this plan was settled, performances were given daily. One day, due to extraordinarily cold weather, the audience was even more sparse. After paying for lighting, donations, and other expenses, the remaining amount was insufficient to even provide thin porridge for the entire troupe. Naturally, the one yuan grooming fee for Shichang could not be paid. The next day, when they were scheduled to perform again, this fellow performer went on strike and did not show up. Shichang sat backstage waiting for a long time, and the performance on the stage was nearing its end, but the person still had not arrived. At this point, the backstage martial artists were filled with public indignation. They all said, "We, the actors who perform a whole act alone, still can't receive even one yuan a day. He is merely attending to the lead actors, yet no matter how difficult it is, we have to pay him one yuan first every day for him to work (gan huo, meaning to do things). Yesterday, because the income was too low, we didn't give him money, and today he doesn't care about righteousness at all and refuses to come to work. In that case, let's beat him up and then disband!" At that time, I heard about this situation in Beijing and felt that these people were truly too pitiful. They are all performers, so why are the famous actors of the Pihuang opera so luxurious and extravagant, while the Kunqu opera performers are so poor that they are about to disband entirely for the sake of one yuan? Isn't this too unfair? Furthermore, Hou Yongkui's "Lin Chong Flees by Night" (Wang Yiyou is already dead) is, without doubt, several times better than Li Wanchun's performance. The "Strange Tiger Assassination" and "Double Meeting" by Han Shichang and Ma Xianglin are also not necessarily weaker than the Four Great Dan of Pihuang opera. Moreover, these people have not gained their skill in a short period of three to five years; they have suffered for many years, and can’t even eat their fill of thin porridge. Yet, they see the newly trained disciples of the Pihuang opera going south and earning large sums of silver, three or five thousand dollars, which cannot help but make them feel disheartened and greatly aggrieved. I fear that they will slowly change careers and seek other opportunities, and the Kunqi opera troupes in the North, which are barely surviving, will disappear from the singing stage and become a forgotten melody.
