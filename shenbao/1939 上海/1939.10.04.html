<h3 id="c1">張伯倫再聲明　决以全國實力認眞作戰　德蘇協定不足以變更英法目標　若提出切實建議亦當加以研究 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>倫敦　德國與蘇聯成立協定之後、英國政策又將如何、頃由張伯倫首相在下議院重行加以說明、在塲諸人均皆屏息而聽、首相之言有云、「國際上已在上星期內發生重大事故、德國外長里賓特洛甫已於九月二十六日作莫斯科之行、所獲結果、並於二十八日公諸於世、耍點凡三、（一）德蘇兩國第四次企圖瓜分波蘭國、並簽訂協定、互相承認其在波蘭國境內所劃定之界綫具有確定性質、此一界綫、以視前此軍事佔領時之臨時界錢、遠較有利於德國、（二）德蘇兩國政府發出聲明、謂波蘭國瓦解後所引起之各種問題、業由彼此兩國切實予以解決、並爲東歐洲和平奠定持久的基礎、則爲全世界各國利益計、德國與英法兩國之戰爭、實宜予以結束、德蘇兩國政府卽當通力合作、務望此種目標、得以迅速達到、此舉若果失敗、則賡續作戰之責任、顯由英法兩國負之、屆時德蘇兩國政府卽當互相諮詢、決定必要的措置、（三）德蘇兩國行當成立長時期的經濟協定、而由蘇聯以原料品易取德國製造品、我國某方面因而主張、英國政府須當說明態度、余却未見有何事物可使吾國變更其所認爲正當之態度、德蘇協定業將波蘭國局勢予以變更、固矣、特德國旣未獲有最後的利益、英國政府更無變更目標之必要、質言之、吾人現正動員不列顚帝國全部資源全部力量、認眞作戰、並無改絃易轍之必要（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>首相繼又回溯英國從事戰爭之理由、及戰爭之直接原因、謂波蘭雖爲造成戰爭之直接原因、但決非根本原因、考此决戰爭之根本原因、係由於英法兩國對於歐洲各國所遭遇之現狀、皆有不能容忍之感覺、認爲祗有兩途可行、卽任其自由蒙受危險、或在平時動員其軍隊、以保衛此自由是、蘇德兩國關於結束戰爭之宣言、將如何措施、今殊噯味、惟共內容似爲一方面提出若干和平條件、一方面則危詞恫嚇、謂若拒絕此項條件、則其後果將若何嚴重云云、余對於此項建議之性質、殊不能加以預料、惟余立卽能言者、一切恫哧均不足使英國或法國放棄其所爲加入引次戰爭之目的、今無一人願意繼續戰爭至非必要之日、惟英法兩國與情之偉大力量、皆決計使暴虐之統制得獲終止、並使各國政府所發之誓言、必須永遠遵守云、今日首相發言時旁聽席中有顯要之外交家多人、蘇聯大使邁斯文基中國大使郭泰祺亦在其列、（三日路透）</p>
<p>張伯倫首相又謂、德國現政府若僅提供保障、實非吾人所能接受、此一政府、凡所接受之的束、均無何項價値、祇求於已有利、不惜予以違反、此種事例、不一而足、茲若再度提出建議、吾人自當懲前毖後、加以研究、予以試騐、戰事倘無賡續進行之必要、任何人必不願多作一日無謂之戰爭、特暴力舉動、亟須予以制止、各國政府凡所提供之諾言、務望其信守不渝、關於此層、英法兩國絕大部份輿論均已具有決心、至是、張伯倫首相乃就戰事進展情形扼要提出報告云、西錢法國軍隊叉復獲有進展、並佔據優良地點、足以窺探德軍陣地、英國大批軍隊亦已開抵法國、與法軍比肩作戰、此種調動頗爲困雞、卒能圓滿予以完成、至可欣幸、此外、我國飛機正在法國前綫偵察敵軍陣地、夜以繼日、並與敵機發生激戰、至以德國潛水艇活動而論、我國海軍正積極搜索、並加以襲擊、深信潛艇防禦辦法一經充實之後、則此種威脅、即可迅予减低、最近一星期來、德國潛艇雖在吾國深岸附近唐賡續活動、但吾國商船無被擊沉者、此應歸功於吾國海軍、德國潛艇現在較遠處襲擊各中立國之輪船、其海盜船在南大西洋方面所構成之威脅、即當依照預定計劃予以應付云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社國會訪員稱、國會議員對於希特勒「和平建議」、完全冷淡視之、各黨無不欽佩海相邱吉爾星期夜之廣播演說、並盼望首相張伯倫今日發表、對德蘇瓜分波蘭之意見時、亦發表同樣切實之言論、下議院昨夜討論、初次預算案所表現之決心、國人將受空前重負、足證全國各界對於業已着手之任務、不稍退縮、戰時預算案昨夜已二讀通過、並無異議、（二日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c2">希特勒最後一着　定今日發表演說　提出和議方案 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>柏林　希特勒在本星期內、大約星期三日、將在國會演說、據現象察之、其言將偏重對外、而非對內、一般人相信、希氏將發表開放門戶對英議和之最後一次演說、如提議竟遭拒絕、則長期戰爭、殆不可免、據義方新聞記者推測、希氏所提和議、包括德蘇問設立小規模波蘭緩衝國、全以波蘭人居住其地一條、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間負實人士頃自各中立國京城接獲可靠消息、據稱義國外長齊亞諾業已携帶德國和平建議、遄返羅馬、其內容乃係主張義國宜於此時出面調處、關於此層、外間雖傳德國元首希特勒所擬提出之和議、將附以威脅之辭、但實際上未必如是、反之德國且有提出若干種合理的建議之可能、此觀於該國日來在某某中立國、例如義大利·荷蘭·比利時三國之外交活動、可以知之、據聞希特勒之和平計劃、擬托中立國人士代爲提出、將使各民治國在表面上獲有勝利、即波蘭境內之旣成事實、亦當力加粉飾、務使其能爲英法兩國所認可、但無論如何、英法兩國態度堅決、已由英國首相張伯倫法國內閣總理達拉第充分加以說明、絕不因此而有所變更、此外、希特勒原係邀請義國首相墨索里尼前往柏林一行、嗣因墨索里尼首相不克分身、乃命齊亞諾外長爲之代表云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3 id="c3">齊亞諾返羅馬　義國內閣開會　討論斡旋和平問題 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>羅馬　聞義內閣定今日舉行會議、義外相齊亞諾昨已結束其與希特勒之談話、午返抵此間、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據羅馬無綫電廣播消息、義外相齊亞諾此决訪問柏林、係討論歐洲新局勢之解決辦法、樹立「公允的和平」其條件有二、（一）除去蘇聯所佔領之各部份外、組織新波蘭國、爲德之保護國、並依允德國原來之要求（二）召集歐洲會議、解決與義大利有重大利益之殖民地及地中海問題、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>米蘭　據隨義外長齊亞諾訪問柏林之「人民報」外交訪員宜稱義大利政府之態度、對於使歐戰局部化、關係至鉅、甚而有決斷之影響、就其所知義大利不願戰事擴大至多瑙河區域、巴爾幹半島地中海西部、甚至歐洲西部、但政治上之疏通、從未如今年八月以來之困難者、現前途困難甚多、特義外長齊亞諾決心堅定努力不怠耳（三日海通電）</p>
<p>羅馬　墨索里尼喉舌蓋達撰文刊登今日義大利日報、作和平呼籲、略謂、齊亞諾之遊柏林、僅表明德義兩國、爲達到公允的和平更廣大結搆中新階段、羅馬與柏林之警告的呼籲、與合乎時宜內發起的行動、均遭拒絕、然義國並不爲之氣餒、墨索里尼於九月初所着手之和平運動、並未告終、今日者乃各國人民與其政府應熟思其最後實任之决定時期、今尙未發生無可挽回之事、凡以公允爲根據之和平觀念、非任何國家或政府可得而拒絕之云（二日路透）</p>
<p>羅馬　關於義大利外交部長齊亞諾在柏林與德外長里賓特洛甫及德元首希特勒之長談、此間今日各報咸加以長篇評論、墨索里尼喉舌義大利名記者蓋達贊同「德意志外交政治通訊之意見、認爲德義政策係和平柱石、現時巳經成就之事實、爲德國巳在東歐洲廓淸凡爾賽條的之遺毒而達到其目的、普遍悲劇、尙未展開、德國及其友邦、均欲早日結束戰事、德國此種改組完全依據和平及正義之原則、此種新秩序、可使歐洲常保平靖、各政府似應縝密考慮其重大責任、勿對此種和平、輕率表示拒絕云、（三日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　戈林上將喉舌「愛森國民日報」、今日第一决發表社評、評論外傳義相墨索里尼將代表希特勒元首提出和平提議之傳說、該報申明兩事、（一）德義兩國領袖之公開合作、乃屬當然之事、（二）德蘇兩國在莫斯科所發宣言、此墨索里尼自開戰以來所抱之願望、完全相同、故德蘇義三國之渴望和平、無庸諱言、特不能容敵方解釋爲厭戰之求和耳、（三日海通社電）</p>

<p>紐約　前美總統胡佛今日與紐的世界電聞報記者接談時、預料英法在此决戰爭中、必不致戰敗、其言曰、余信協的國必能保衛其帝國、彼等當可獲勝、即至不幸、亦不過不分勝負而巳、戰爭爆發至今、僅及一月、然重大因素已漸呈露矣、英法雖遭潛艇與飛機之威脅、力能控制七海、而彼等之人力亦能保衛法國、祇須勿冒險輕取攻勢、因以竭其人力可無他虞也云、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3 id="c6">蘇聯大批生力軍　調至外蒙邊境　日軍在諾蒙亨戰役　死傷達一萬八千人 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>東京　今日陸軍省發言人宣稱、日蘇雖己簽訂休戰協定、但蘇聯己調大隊生力軍及大批飛機坦克軍、至外蒙與「滿洲國」之邊境、日本在諾蒙亨事變中之損失、共計死傷一萬八千人、繼蒙方面之傷亡、恐未必少於日方云、該發言人復略述日蘇簽訂休戰協定之經過、謂日方對於諾蒙亨事變、自始即堅持一種地方化與不擴大之政策、因地勢兵力及其他要素之關係、隔哈拉欣河對峙之兩軍、祇限於小規模之戰事云（三日路透）</p>

<p>立陶宛京城　外交部長烏爾勃西斯、應蘇聯政府之邀、頃於今晨九時半率同隨員飛往拉晚維亞京城、準備在該處換搭航郵機、轉赴莫期科、此間一般人鑒於蘇聯政府係以友好精神邀請外長前往、咸皆相信、該國不致向立陶宛國提出領土性質或軍事性質之要求、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>日本首相阿部，外相野村，前日在彼邦地方長官會議席上演說內政外交方針，辭刊昨報。日本所謂地方長官會議，所務在於中樞官員之闡明政策，指導措施，地方官員之陳述職守，報告治績；要在於說，無所謂議，顧爲行政上之重要集會也。此决集會，乃阿部組閣登臺後之初决集會；阿部登臺適在議院閉會期間，故迄今尚無正式發表政治演說之機會，而前日演說即爲新閣員出席重要集會之初次表示；惟爲初次，應予另眼看待。</p>
<p>察彼召集此會之主旨，厥爲實施總動員法；此後將使日本平民作空前未有之犧牲，負空前未有之重擔；此其機動操於中樞，而其實效繫於地方；斯惟有集地方官員於一堂，耳提而面命之，責以必忠必誠。察彼動員法之精神與條款，將使日人之血與汗，涓滴歸公；復使日人之一舉一動，盡歸節制；侵略第三年矣，速戰速決之戰略有如幻夢，斯惟有悉索敝賦，孤注一擲，以作黷武之最後嘗試。是以吾人對於日本召集地方長官會議，實施總動員法之後，其事功成績究竟如何，其平民慘痛究竟如何，値得嚴重注意；雖謂尤甚於彼所宣述之外交政策可也。</p>
<p>就阿部與野村演說之外交部分而剖析之，要點凡六：（一）承認「國際情勢複雜微妙，其動向不容逆覩，」亦即不能把握。（二）以「中國事變之處理，東亞新體制之建設」爲日本當前最大問題；舉凡內政外交政策，乃至對笫三國，對歐洲戰爭之態度，悉以此最大問題爲核心。（三）說明「擬專心致力於中國事變之解決，而「處理中國事變之根本方針，業經決定，決不因內閣之更迭而隨之變動。」（四）聲明「日本所求於中國者，係中日間政治的經濟的提携」，「處理事變之最高目標，乃在乎中日滿之一體制。」（五）報告日本在中國方面所謂「新中央政府」者，行將「成立」。（六）日本對此所謂「新中央政府」，援之成立，與之提携，然「如以新中央政府之成立，即目之爲事變之終結，則爲未可」蓋日人謂彼「所負使命，不僅爲和平之回復」，要在完成其「中日滿一體制」之最高目標。在此六點之外，有關對於一般國際者，照例聲明並無排除笫三國在華經濟活動之意念，申述希冀笫三國拋棄援助中國國民政府政策之願望；此後「擬根據處理中國事變之旣定方針，充分攷慮歐局之後，實行多角的綜合的對外政策；一切親疎友敵，悉以笫三國之對華態度是吾適合日本意願爲衡。對於德國曩日以强化日德義防共協定爲務，此項折衝，宣告「終止」。對於蘇聯，擬陸續解決懸案。對於英國，因關於天津方面具體問題之處理，英方未能同意於日本要求，英日會談因此宣告「流產」。對於美國，擬繼續努力，俾美國能充分理解日方之「眞意」。</p>
<p>剖析之後，請加檢討。</p>
<p>阿部與野村演說之中，有關對於德蘇英美之部分，頗見平坦；誠以長官對屬員，未便張揚誇誕也。對於一般國際，發揮其傳統之日本中心主義，此外絕無新提示。對於中國曁中日戰爭，大體不脫其發動武力侵略以來之窠臼；然以追逐於時勢之推移，相應而作較新之說明。其間有足抉剔言之者；演辭數及新體制，而未嘗言及十閱月來吹唱不絕之新秩序；原所謂「新秩序」，自始未有定義式之解釋；然望文生義而言之，所謂「新秩序」猶得視爲國際問題中之術語，而所謂「新體制」則不得不視爲祗宜適用於國內政治問題之新術語矣；咬文嚼字，或爲武夫所藐視，然以武其一也。新體制云云，意何所指？政治提携云云，意何所指？求彼演辭之中，得簡明之註解焉，即所謂「中日滿之一體制」是也；抑國與國之間，而成爲一體制焉，其意又何所指？近之如英與法盟，未聞英法一體制也；日德義有反共協定，未聞三國一體制也；美國，美洲之盟主也，近數日，在汎美大會中，尤有經濟提携之決定，有爲保持中立而守望相助之决定，未聞美洲一體也；遠之如瑞典挪威嘗共一王，未聞瑞挪兩國爲一體，奧大利匈牙利嘗共一帝，未聞奧匈兩國爲一體也；總之，獨立國與獨立國間，未嘗稱一體制也。然則日人所求之三位一體，顯然欲以近年所經營之於中國東四省者，同樣經營之於中國其他淪陷區域而傀儡之；美洲式之經濟提携萬不足以饜日本之最高目標，日德義三國之反共協定決不足解說國際之政治提携；此其二也。日本所謂「處理中國事變」，阿部等旣復不以軍事貫澈其目標爲言，而所期待於行將予以援助成立之所謂「新中央政權」者，亦不復以此作結束中日戰爭之想。吾人誠不辭神經過敏之誚，不避强作解人之譏歟？或可恍然大悟曰，日本所謂「中日滿一體制」之「中」，原係「新中央政府之「中」，初非中華民國之「中」也；故於所敵對之中華民國國民政府曾無一語抨擊，亦即所以表示今後日本將專心致力於淪陷區之「新中央政府」，而以此爲經營之範疇歟？此其三也。九一八以來，日本內閣迭變，所述所謂「對華根本方針」，質量不一；阿部野村演說雖詳盡，每事輒舉其時日，獨於所謂旣定方針不隨內閣而變動，吝於指明何年何日何人發表之方針；此則掩護體面之烟幕，模稜浮泛之空言也，若予追求，等於刻舟求劍；雖然，政治經濟提携也，一體制也，阿部野村明白言之矣，更何追求；此其四也。</p>
<p>時人之論日本和戰者，論日本誠偽者，見仁見智，未能盡同；夫止於空論，則亦已矣，若論實際，則僅以主觀見解解釋一切而不獲客觀事實證明一切，實屬冒險之甚。若阿部野村所表示，吾人不欲取爲斥責侵略之新對象，然衷誠期望研討中日問題者取爲論證之新資料。以吾人觀感，姑毋推論謂解決中日問題之前途如何渺茫遼遠，然循阿部野村所表示而推論之，日本之阿部內閣非能解決中日問題者也。</p>

<p>首由原提案人畢德曼發表演說、加以說明、並竭力主張軍火禁運條款必須予以廢止、其扼要語有云「或謂禁止以軍火售予各交戰國、可使吾人對於戰時殘殺人類生命一事、不負何項責任、此種觀念、實屬錯誤、即以遠東戰事而論、吾人對於日本軍隊在中國境內殘殺華人之所爲、實已間接參加之」、蓋以日本正向吾國購買各種原料品、以之製造軍火對華作戰故也、畢德曼詞畢、共和黨參議員外交委員會委員波拉繼之發言、則以反對派名義、竭力反對廢止軍火禁運條款、認爲此舉徒使美國無法拒絕以援助給予歐洲各民治國、波拉致詞時、畢德曼會一再挿言加以駁斥、雙方舌劍唇槍、爭辯甚烈、例如波拉嘗云、現行中立法在文字上乃係「中立的」、但畢德曼則謂、此法在實施時並不中立、加之此法雖禁止以軍火運往各交戰國、但蘇聯義大利乃至羅馬尼亞各國、仍可向美國購買軍火、以之運往德國云、迄午後三時四十五分、暫告休止、延會至明日午間續議、並决定嗣後每日均於正午開會、午後五時以前散會、至何時結束辯論、尚未確定、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>畢德曼以外委會主席資格發言稱、「現行中立法所載軍火禁運條款利於德國、顯有歧視其他各交戰國之嫌、至修正案主張廢止此項條款、實乃政府方面歷來向國會提出各項法案中最重要之一件、可使美國避不捲入歐戰漩渦、時至此日、全世界受有大西洋彼岸戰禍之威脅、其性質之嚴重、實爲人類整個勝史上所罕見、舉世惶惶、莫不抱有恐懼與疑慮之情緒、但吾人苟能信守國際公法各項原則、並阻止本國人民自蹈危險、則似無充分理由、可虞重蹈上次歐戰時之覆轍、而捲入戰爭漩渦、」凡反劉廢止軍火禁運條類者、往往認爲歐美航運他日當由英法兩國加以控制、因此准許軍火出口、徒使各該國獲有便利、殊不知德國乃大陸國、司自義大利·蘇聯·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞暨其他各國取獲軍火接濟、吾國禁止軍火出口、豈非徒使德國蒙有利益、又况美國實施現行中立法之時、德國尚可假手其他各中立國、自美國取得各種軍火耶、抑羅斯福總統曾經發出宣言、聲明決當竭盡所能、務使美國置身歐戰以外、本人對於總統此項宣言、深信不疑、並敢斷言中立法修正之後、總統亦決不致濫用此法所賦予之權力、總之、吾人即使限制各交戰國向吾國購買軍火、亦未必能維持中立或公道、此層實屬彰彰明甚、至本國輪船之航行海外者、則必須禁止其以貨物運往各交戰國、蓋以吾國輪船倘不爲各交戰國載貨而各交戰國又皆能知之、則各該國即不復有何籍口、可在公海之上襲擊美國輪船、以致傷害美國水手生命，須知上次歐戰時、美國所由加入戰爭者、正因美國水手曾在公海上被人用非法的不人道的手段加以傷害所致、又安知德國不以該國潛水艇未能安然浮至海面、攔截他國商船所載違禁品爲口實、而於必耍時、重新推行一九一七年之政策、而濫施襲擊哉、又安知戰事曠日持久之後、各交戰國不因處境日非、而濫用一切手段、以破壞他國輪船及其所載之違禁品哉、或謂禁正軍火售予各交戰國、可使吾人對於戰時殘殺人類生命一事、不質何項責任、此種觀念、實屬錯誤、卽以遠東戰事而論、吾人對於日本軍隊在中國境內殘殺華人之所爲、實已間接參加之、蓋以日本正向吾國購買各種原料品、以之製造軍火對華作戰故也、</p>
<p>此外、本人所提出之修正案、更主張以九十日期之商業信用放款、給予各交戰國、此乃極其正當之辦法、因實際上與現金交易無異、且此項辦法與强生法並不抵觸、（按强生法規定、各國凡未償付戰債本息者、不得再在美國舉債、但前任司法部長克明、至於一九三四年間栽定、强生法並不涉及普通商業交易、）至中立法修正之後、本國航業自不免感受若干影饗、爲抵補損失計、各輪船公司可將太平洋與南大西洋各航綫水脚、酌量提高、「要而言之、不論新中立法能以何種影響加諸本國航業、然在愛國之美國公民決無一人反對作此犧牲、且權衡利害、與其准許本國商船爲各交戰國載貨、以致受有危險、不若逕由本國政府担負因停止此項交易而引起之損失、是以本國商船在戰爭期內、必須停止此項營業、毫無疑義」云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>魯蘇皖邊區游擊總指揮官李明揚、日前由前綫視畢防務返署、據其談稱、「中國欲達最後勝利、必須要經過大反攻之階段、現據國內外之種種情勢觀察、中國離總反攻期、確非遙遠、故最後勝利、亦近在目前也」、繼稱、「渠於去年初抵蘇北時、因鑒於當地軍隊、編制不一、漫無案統、對於抗戰、殊鮮效果、苟一旦下令反攻、實難統一指揮、乃集合具有救國正義而又有相當紀律之游擊隊、童整改編、秣馬厲兵、畫夜無間、及至今日、實力巳逾十萬有寄、密佈於蘇北各縣要隘、計有第一縱隊司令丁聚堂。第二縱隊司令顏秀吾。第三縱隊司令陳才福·第四縱隊司令陸洲舫等部、蜿蜓數百里、層槍疊砲草木皆兵、而防禦工事、允爲堅固、敵如來犯、當句予以重大之打擊」云云、</p>

<p>至於本港戰時紙價飛漲原因、（一）由於來源短少、只剩挪威。芬蘭有貨來港、今後之來貨、亦須相當時間後、始能運到、（二）本港存紙、按的略估計、僅可供全港三個月之用、（三）卽有來貨、紙價亦未必能恢復、由於現時成本、運費保險費均較以前增加至鉅、（四）來源旣缺、爭相購躉、此亦促成紙價上漲之一原因、</p>
<p>現時紙價每力（印大報一千張）的在港幣七元半至八元之間、以前每刀祇三元六角、價格高漲一倍、故如普通新聞紙一大張、以前成本的三釐六七左右、現時卽達六七釐、</p>

<p>晨每條（十兩）初開以外匯略硬、局勢帶疲、做小五元、現金號吐予錢兌業十兩價爲四千〇三十元、開後某錢兌業買胃陡健、回高二十五元、錢兌業互做二十兩價爲四千〇五十五元、時外匯鬆勢更銳、爲狀重虛、證劵帮與金號等爭先求售、且某銀號力代華僑富商多頭出籠、價遂不支下瀉、打破四千元大關、現金號售予金號三十兩爲三千九百七十五元、十時二十分光景外滙忽由鬆轉平、人心爲之一轉、證券帮反出爲進、同時錢兌業亦買意轉濃、遂回出叫千元大關、錢兌業進某銀號五十兩、爲四千〇二十元、時某掮客代浮多力售百兩、一度又撳小至四千〇〇五元、此後某銀樓代港帮猛吸、復趨向上、不久即高起五十五元、某銀樓進金號及錢兌業各十兩、爲四千〇六十元、十一時半外匯復轉鬆動、賣風又起，銀樓帮套賣頗力、遂降落四十五元、錢兌業吐予銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千〇十五元、作午收價、午後初開做小十元、錢兌業及銀樓帮各塞予金號十兩、爲四千〇〇五元、開後金號與證劵帮乘低拉提、抬高二十五元、金號進錢兌業三十兩、爲四千〇三十元、時因外滙報硬、引起賣風、回挫至四千〇〇五元、後證券帮進意頗濃、再抬起二十五元、證券帮進錢兌業三十兩、爲四千〇三十元、入後某金號代投機商拋塞又回落十五元、某金號賣予銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千〇十五元作晚收價、結果比上日續跌二十元、聞收後證劵帮又來吸進錢兌業三小兩、價爲四千〇二十元、全天八十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進須减小三十元光景、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百十元、迨至九時五十分掛小五元、十時半回上五元、正午復掛低五元、此後無變化、結果計大同行改懸四百〇五元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减小二十元光景、</p>

<p>昨日外幣市况、益形不支、一方因滙市步鬆未已、而市上種種傳說、亦足以刺激人心、於是賣氣愈盛、英金鎊下落一元五角、美金票跌四角、香港票降五分、法郎票小五厘、新加坡票落一角、安南票及羅比票各小五分、坎拿大票低四角、菲列濱票降二角、日金票則升六厘、朝鮮票仍站一元一角七分二厘、其餘各幣尚穩、</p>

<p>紗市轉趨軟化之途、蓋以外匯黑市鬆懈、同時市塲上時有一種捕風捉影之談尤使人心恍惚不定、市情猶入徬徨之境、大概均係一般經營搶帽子交易者製造所成、至於客方亦袖宇而勿動、香港帮受匯款牽制活動、採辦力量大爲削减、故對於十支粗紗稍有購買裝現、其他帮口絕少生氣、內地江浙兩省、近來因日紗價昂、改購華紗較多、不過二十支筒子及粗紗爲暢也、又上日四二支五子價曾報一千零二十元、此紗價恐不正確、附此糾正、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、昨日尚稱熱鬧、平果兒售價一百三十六元、西印度一百七十餘元、美棉交易殊為靜寂、未聞成交、已有多日、良以美國開駛遠東船隻稀少、貨艙難定所致耳、日來通州到貨甚多、昨日有通州三千餘包到申、因之白洛區售價難能轉挺、昨日祇售一百六十七元云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初即形疲乏、因缺乏買戶、棉價跌落六七磅音、後又因大衆賣出、及多　了結、市况未能轉堅、結果收盤價格較之上日跌去六七磅音、印度昨日停市、預測較昨日略漲一羅羅比餘、埃及棉市殊爲機秀、昨日猛漲七十餘暸音、利物浦漲四辦士、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、市塲不脫一片渙散氣象、實緣現銷交易不活動、廣帮心思平淡、有一部對於粗紗尚有交易、然額量微乎其微、二十支紗非但無胃口、反而吐出、就此情况市象乏勁矣、開盤喊價甚高、然吃戶寥寥、雙馬現貨開價小一元、爲七百七十三元、惟棧單跌五元、爲七百四十元、少頃聞黃金不振、外匯放長、賣風起而挫跌八九元、現貨雙馬價爲七百六十四元、收盤稍回上、查半日成交一千四百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌六元、天女跌十元、雙地球跌九元、今日出口有六十五件運厦門、四十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉交易、益覺發展、日廠亦活動採辦矣、至於同業成交更見熱鬧、故棉價基礎依然堅挺、市上做開之生意、仍係華棉白包花爲大宗、日華亦進通花一千包、價爲一百六十四元半、太康進美棉魯米特令三百件、華廠新生榮豐納胃殊健、所以售價續升矣、碼頭上到通花一千八百三十八包、常陰沙八百三十四包、茲將現棉售開之盤列左、</p>

<p>隔昨秈米自回落三五角後、價盤似已較低、所以無論本鄉作客、都有趁廉納辦之意、昨復以到貨稀少、祇蘇崑楓嘉由車輪運抵三千一二百包、人心遂堅、行販客家均即喊高、故早市各米價曾提三五角、何如邇來到旺銷衰、市上籌碼尚豐、經此一好、懷貨者乘機推出、一霎時形勢反呈疲軟、各價仍回落、結果粳米悉居定局，未見榮辱、特常粳仍爲四十三四元、中四十一元、特錫粳四十二三元、中四十一元、蘇同崑粳四十一元、新粳卅八元、楓涇百哥四十元、新羊尖初喊二十七元後、實開二十六元半、次爲一十五元半、蘆尖亦自二十六元半、次爲二十五元半、川尖二十五元至二十四元、蕪湖特尖始曾做間二十三元四角、後僅二十三元及二十二元半、砶尖二十一元半及二十一元、江北新尖二十二元八角至二十二元半、變元無變化、又爲三十四五元、統市成交數六千餘包、</p>
<p>另訊、連朝回落後、本客消化漸旺、良以秈米最低價與梗米最高價、相差達一倍以上、不獨爲貧民歡迎、即中產階級亦多改食秈米、因此存到雖多、銷量步增、昨日目有內地鄉莊問津、又傳車輪來貨被某方扣留之說、貨方趁機喊高、市面遂又回振三四角、統市本街各戶去二千餘包、內地鄉莊去三千餘包、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨現粉廠盤仍鮮變化、回籠粉市已不振、因廠方催提棧貨、福新二次通告客戶、自逾限不轉棧者、每月微收堆棧損失費每包五角、故棧單貨大受影響、執貨者紛紛貶脫、貨價初開六元九角至八角半、中間一度混亂、曾到六七角之價、而本街與客帮實銷、亦因此反爲减縮、統市成交約計三四萬包、麵粉今日出口、有四千四百四十包、運往厦門、又一萬一千五百包、運往香港、</p>

<p>日方曾於上月間宣稱、對溫州海道三處港口加以封鎖、昨日復叉由日本駐華艦隊司令官請駐滬日總領事三浦、以領事館名義、通知駐華各國外交官及海關方面、謂將封鎖該處之古鰲頭、其內容可分爲三點、（一）日本海軍部隊、定十月六日上午八時（日本時間）、對於溫州南方的三十海里之古鰲頭、實行軍事行動、請第三國停泊該港之軍艦船隻、於該時間以前、駛出外海、日軍爲軍事行動之必要上、定於該時間以後、以障碍物及危險物封鎖該港口、以致不能通行、如在該時間以前、不駛出之艦船所受損失、日方不能負責、（二）障碍物及危險物之位置、爲通過琵琶山之南北一錢、（三）古鰲頭附近將成爲戰鬥區域、務希住在該方面之第三國人民、早時離去、另悉關於日方宣稱封鎖溫州各港口、此决己爲第三决矣、</p>

<p>懷着異樣興奮的情緒，堅決而眷戀地離開了尚未淸醒的家。淸晨的空氣還帶着濛濛的寒氣，第一次這麽早自己一個在路上走，在她無論如何也是個新鮮的趣味。路上人很稀少，時候還是早得很，她也知道，但却並不放緩了步調，她以爲：第一天總應該早一點，而且自己獨個兒先到了，那末和遲來的一個一個的打招呼，總比自己遲到了跟一羣羣的招呼要自然些。於是，不知不覺地更走得快起來。</p>
<p>在巷口，一股烈臭的氧味刺進她的鼻孔，她連忙拿手帕掩緊，她像遲疑般地走到弄中，那座高高的死板板的大門，嚴肅地閉着。她伸手在門環上吼了幾下，裏面一點聲音都沒有，歇了一下，才發見門沒有關緊，虛掩着留了一條縫，便輕輕地推開了走進去。</p>
<p>走進了工塲，一陣微薄的阿西通杳味迎面刺進鼻管。橫橫豎豎地列了幾張堅糙的木桌，機器也都靜息着，經掃帚掃過的地板上還淺淺地留了木屑的痕跡，她在自己的位置裹坐了下來。</p>
<p>樓梯上響着懶懶的鞋聲，心裹忖度這或許是工頭，經理，他們該在一早就起來的，察看機器……，但是最先出現門口的是掃帚和畚箕，接着便是個齷齪的沒精打彩的男孩子。她糊裏糊塗地跟他打個招呼，那男孩子也驚愕了一下，不聲不饗地把畚箕帶掃帶端進裏面去。</p>
<p>工友們三個五個地陸續來了，塲內立刻熱鬧起來。時鐘敲着七點時，馬達開動了，那些男工們都分站到機器旁，她圍上了新製的圍裙，心裹感到一縷莫名的喜悅。</p>
<p>鋸板的機器揚起一陣一陣的灰塵般的木屑，調和着濃厚的阿西通味，混成惡濁的空氣。好幾個男工都套着口罩，大半却沒有戴。女工們更一個都沒有。阿西通的濃味薰得她喉頭辛燥，髮上身上都罩着一片木屑，看看其餘的幾個，都像若無其事般地，談笑聲跟機器聲賽饗，她竭力忍耐：「習慣了就不怕了。」</p>
<p>「你們爲甚麼不也套口罩？」她有到這一羣裹就沒有一個够健康的，雖然精神是相當活潑。</p>
<p>「戴不慣！套上了悶着鼻孔，很不自在！」那正跟別人談得起勁的鄰位女工回答她。眉毛上也砌滿了木粉。</p>
<p>背後磨光部內，二十來雙手中執着的砂紙，摩擦着粗糙的雛型木片的邊沿時，瀰漫出整房間的有害人體的空氣，然而工作者像知覺也己麻木般地低着別只做，她不禁又是憐惜又是欽佩，她很想說；健康也是要緊呀！</p>
<p>「晚上工作到幾點鐘？」停一會後，她又問。</p>
<p>「九點半。」</p>
<p>「這末夜！」</p>
<p>「男工們還得到十點半才歇呢？</p>
<p>「待遇好些吧？」</p>
<p>「這却不見得。他們的薪水比我們還低，名目不呌工人，只算學生意，所以他們的工作比一般人都苦，而薪水還得打折扣！</p>
<p>「啊！——」</p>
<p>她不禁深深地爲他們不平，心上掠過一陣憐憫。</p>
<p>午飯時間有一個鐘點，除了回去的幾個外，其餘的吃過飯後便都到鋸木部跟男工們談天，只有她獨自留在打底處靜靜地吃着走麵包。趁着空間，她去看釉漆部，打孔，釘合，……等幾部。處處都是寂靜的，颺起的塵埃看來也是間間的。</p>
<p>她拿起一具將完成的活動象，那象鼻一擺一擺的搖蕩着，她伸着手指上面輕輕地一點一點：</p>

<h3 id="c104">寒衣代金二十萬 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>時序的輪轉，又到了深秋，冷峭的寒流已開始侵襲大地，牠的威力是隨着時間而加劇。我們，是幸運的，躱在屋子裏，已經瑟縮不勝寒，那些爲着我們，爲着我們的子子孫孫自由生存而搏鬬於原野，跳奔於山岳，翻騰於河流的將士，他們所受冷氣流的威脅，更千萬倍劇厲於我們，當此嚴冬將至，我們在裁製自己的寒衣之餘，能無動於中麽？我想，誰都願意自動捐獻起來吧？</p>
<p>今年全國徵募寒衣運動委會，對於各特殊區域已規定募集寒衣代金，而上海方面所擔負的僅僅只有二十萬元。假定目前大的有四百萬人口來計算，那麼一個人對於將士們的冬季貢獻僅僅五分而巳！專實上眞不費吹灰之力。貧窮入雖多，可是貧窮人呈獻寒衣代金，也許較富豪爲爽捷。所以，我們希望來一個獻呈寒衣代金的競爭運動，在量的方面，可能的予以擴充，多多益善。</p>
<p>寒衣，雖然是具有禦寒的作用，然而呈獻將士的寒衣，除了用作禦寒外，還有軍民間密切聯繫和誠摯鼓勵的表示，允其是處在特殊區域的我們，更可以表示着想望和關懷的殷切。同時，將士們對於特殊區域所呈獻的寒衣，也必較穿着後方民衆所呈獻的更爲感動，更爲振奮，更爲努力！</p>
<p>在我們方面說來，住在上海的人，眞像處在一輛脫了鈞的火車中，失却了前進的動力，生活上受到難以言喻的痛苦。即以最顯明的事實而言，日用品的被統制，操縱，運輸困難，以致物價飛騰。使生命大有難乎延續之概，妻寒子飢，其因素何在？這就是「先有國而後才有家」的例證。所以，我們不能空自嗟嘆生活程度高昂，或者引頸蹺趾而盼物價回跌，要用力量去掃除加給我們的壓力才是辦法。從前曾有一般認識不足的人，好像事不干已，自以爲住在租界可以置身局外，一味的逍遙享樂，胡天胡帝，不事振作，到現在，這種錯誤覺是已有糾正的事實了。誠如蔣總裁的諭言：「地無分南北，人無分老幼，……抗戰是每一個中國人的事…每個人須做到有錢出錢，有力出力。」</p>
<p>上海呈獻寒衣代金二十萬，只不過聊勝於無能了，嚴格地說，實不算做到「有錢出錢有力出力」。上海人，踴躍吧！未來的收穫當有萬萬倍高於寒衣的代價啊！</p>

<p>第十六回　謀興醫學造士成庠　思擴村治託兒所</p>
<p>她們的定了到上海去的日子以後，到星期六下午，吳君素便在寄宿舍裹，專等她們的光降了。這一回，吃金澹雲的喜酒的人，的確很多。因爲她的交游很廣，而且她平日之間，待人寬和。連林建成那邊，也沒有她那邊的人多咧。有人說：這一回，他們所收人家送來的結婚禮物，一定是不少呀。實在也並不見多，因爲這個風氣，戰後與戰前是大大地變換了。在戰前凡是社會間的婚喪喜慶，都要送禮：所送的禮物，又往往不合實用。譬如人家有喜事，往往送一頂大紅綢幛，還有四個金字，眞是一無所用。有許多人家，因爲認得兩位闊人，闊人送了幛　，便高高掛起，以爲我是與闊人有往來的。甚而至於闊人並未送幛子，而假造了闊人下款，也是有的。到了戰後，這些虛榮假意，都打破了。而且那種幛子，在最先是羽呢的，緞子的，還可以改做衣服被面。到後來，變成了最壞的人造絲，除了做幛子以外，無別用。還有什麽送銀盾銀器的，都是銅片片，塗上　些銀。嵌上紅木的座子，裝上玻璃的框子，似乎有些美術的，實在是俗陋不堪。這個東西，還要無用，因爲幛子，換了一個上下款，還可以轉送給人家；那種銀盾之類，刻上了你的名字，還有他們自已的名字，便不能轉送給人家。留着沒有用，棄之則可惜，把它堆起來，倒要出空間房子咧。那秤東西，製起來時，値七八塊錢的東西，要是賣給收舊貨的人，兩三隻角子他還不要咧。在那時的送禮，自然不要什麼幛子啊，銀盾啊，最爽快的，自然是送現金。但有許多人，往往生活尚不能自給，却爲了面子問題，硬要送禮。甚而至於什些官塲中，或是老太太做　，或是少爺討親，小姐出閣，公開收禮。做他下屬的，要拍上司的馬屁，也公開微收份子。在送禮之中，還分出階級等次來，有什麼福祿壽喜的等級，無論你在斷炊仰屋的當兒，這上司的禮是不能不送的。這風氣不但是在官塲，在一種機關裏，甚而至於那些商界裹，也都如此。好像你若是不送了禮，便無顏見人，這明明是公開的賄賂，那風氣之壞，是怎樣的怕人呀！（一八七）</p>
<h3 id="c106">試行戒煙 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 佳</p>
<p>每一個吸烟的人都有過一次以上決意戒除這嗜好的誓言吧？我想。但是有誰能够言行一致的呢，即使是一個比較長一點的時期？其實，每一個吸烟的人都知道紙烟決沒有其他毒物那樣難以戒除，而且誰也不肯承認吸紙烟是有癮的，這是從每個人都有遇一次以上的戒烟時期可以証明的。然而却沒有一個人能够持久戰，朋友之問我們時常聽到戒烟的誓言，有的甚至幾個人訂立合同，簽署嚴厲的處罰條例，結果祗是勉强維持幾天，其中有一個人破壞了合同之後，就無形取消，遺留着一個永久的笑話。也曾有一位朋友，患病進醫院，因此强逼着戒除了紙烟，他也以此自豪，以爲這一次才達到了戒烟的目的。可是出院後不到一月，又從「飯後一枝烟」而習以爲常了。他却還有他的飾詞，他說：這是環境使然的，在醫院裹醫生不准吸烟，同院也沒有吸烟的人，就大家不吸了。然而現在，爲了朋友之間酬酢，或者營業上的來往，紙烟是最普遍的交際品，因此也不得不略事點綴了。這話自然也有一部份理由，所謂「交際烟」是也。</p>
<p>所以，我就從來沒有勸人戒烟，也沒有自己立誓戒烟，祗要在可能範圍內「少吸」，即是「交際烟」也到了非交際不可的時候才交際交際。現在却第一次來「試行戒烟」了，「試行」自然不是堅決戒烟的意思，不過自古成功在嘗試，如果自已的意志堅强的話，這試行」或許就是「戒絕」的初步成功。</p>
<p>所謂「試行戒烟」是附有下面的條件的。第一：就是「少吸」，譬如從前買罐裝的，現在買盒裝，這樣可以隨時檢點自已今天巳吸了幾校烟，而且無形减了吸烟的機會。第二：一般人就是說吸烟是爲了解悶，因此在空間的時候，買一點糖菓花生等來代替紙烟，以達到「少吸」的目的。</p>
<p>現在紙烟售價飛漲，普通一毛錢一盒的紙烟，都漲到兩毛左右了，每月在這方面的消耗，就加了一倍，在這米珠薪桂的時候，於節的上講，也應减少這種無謂的消耗。大家來試試看，測騐一下自己的意志堅强與否？</p>

<p>更新舞台由平聘來新角於二十七日之夕開始登台，日間行開幕禮，吳（素秋）趙（金蓉）梁（韻秋）李（婉雲）四坤旦剪綵，卑人躬與其盛，晚間四坤旦合演之四五花洞遂不欲觀。五花洞一劇，眞假成雙，事理所無，况雙上再加一番而成四，更近胡鬧。四大旦之唱片以及四潘金蓮之電影吾且怕聽，怕看，矧四小旦耶－第三日吳素秋之雙齣，（寶蓮燈，戰宛城，）靑衣花旦可以兼看；又有老生陳少霖，老旦李多奎，大面李春恒可觀，於是吾往矣。到時，監酒令己唱過，此劇小生扮朱虛侯劉章，唱二簧慢板，極難精工，昔德珺如拿手，周維俊未曾見過，不知彼唱得如何。</p>
<p>李多奎唱太君辭朝，多奎嗓子頗稱高響，字音稍欠淸剛，長亭餞行一塲之西皮首板，放聲一歌，充沛異常，即此便是唱戲本領，老且行人才寥落，祇好讓多奎獨步，不必與謝寶雲龔雲甫比也。</p>
<p>寶蓮燈有鬧學一塲，陳少霖扮劉彥昌，唱工極守規矩，無一出律之腔，可謂衆醉獨醒者，吾最贊許，嗓音正味，毫無邪氣，音雖不大，尚能一放，再養衷氣，用苦工，可大紅：做工神氣，有極佳之處，如向妻云，「醒來說話……我就跪，」故示不經意以騙妻盟誓，此處最得體。白口數句之中，有幾字聲低而字不淸，宜注意改之。</p>
<p>吳素秋扮王桂英，用新派唱首板上，扮相美觀，滿腔全是聰明，身段圓熟，唱新腔並不討厭，字眼大致不差，惟「花發轍」似尚小雲，鈍而悶，非改去不可，如「打」字唱念近於古音，由「朶」字發聲，非旦角所宜有也。做工神情極精細，多由聰明中得來，（使演影戲，可以壓倒一切，惜乎電影中不出此等材料也，）隣座友人曰：「素秋唱做好而行頭不佳。」吾笑曰：「有此等面龐眉月，患無人贈新行頭耶？」</p>
<p>戰宛城中張繼是梁慧超扮，梁年靑而技火熾，南派也。李春恒扮曹操，仿郝壽臣，老辣之外，加倍滑稽，惜嗓音已不如前。吳素秋扮鄒氏，深知戲情，全做得出，觀二鼠打架，及樓上彈琴覷曹瞞，姿態飄逸，得苟慧生之秘訣，女子有此媚態，又加以似笑非笑之臉，誰不願看，不紅何待。吳之花旦戲較靑衣尤佳，蓋艷如桃李，宜於熱而不宜於冷也，因時已十一鐘半，未觀刺嬸，而塲子「馬前」，巳呈促迫之象云</p>

<p>— 張冰獨</p>
<p>讀「話劇在上海的前途」後　獻給「孤島」的劇運工作者</p>
<p>我們不能否認，在近年的游藝界裹「綠寶劇塲」是佔有了很優越的地位。他們以話劇的姿態經常出演於這「孤島」，巳是將兩年的事了。能够維持得這麼久，獲得這麽多的觀衆。我認爲實在匪可藐視的。</p>
<p>記得曾有過一次，碰着他們的負責人。他告訴我：「戲劇離不開大衆，我們能够有今日，完全是大量觀衆所支持」。因爲，如果沒有觀衆，怎能站得穩據點，他又說：「我們一眼看淸了這點。來看戲的人，總是有閒階級的佔多數，而須以戲劇來敎育的，也便是這一部份以及其他部分的人。我們要把這一部份人，尤其是太太小姐們拉來，不是一件容易的事，可是現在他們巳成爲我們常年的觀衆了。每次換新戲的時候，總得他們的光臨。」</p>
<p>可是，話又得說回來，我們對這部份觀衆，眞的扳着面孔，正正經經地敎訓他們時，那未免太不議峙務了·人家出了錢，主要的自然不是來聽敎訓！然而，我們則是預備使他們受到敎訓的·爲了技巧，爲了敎育，所以我們還是迎合這部份觀衆，但並不過份將就他們。我們要使他們看得明白，句句話要打入他的心坎，要使得他們覺得我們同他們很接近，肯同情，然後方有感化，即使是把水準降低些，我們也願意。－－適度的降低下還是爭取大衆的技巧，因此，我們便這樣獲得了大量觀衆，同時對這大量的觀衆，我們是可以發揮戲劇應有的力量了。」</p>
<p>關於這些，我是希望劇運工作者能以最大的虛心來接受活生生的事實！</p>

<p>大元的琴師是他舅舅陳某，每晚必往他家中走走，大元又用功甚勤，所以雖是照着慶奎的法子打針戒烟，但是每晚吊嗓的功課，依舊並未間斷。誰想幾天以後，嗓子就覺得不大得勁，同時高老慶也發現了這個毛病，拿胡琴一試，不但是一字不出，而且連說話都啞的聽不出音來啦。大元一聽，幾乎嚇死，心裹想到，我們吃開口飯的，全仗着這條嗓子，倘是本錢折了，那就算後半輩子沒有飯啦。因此他立刻將郭醫生辭退，重新設燈，又抽了回來他幸虧發覺得早，所以嗓子未受到影響，可惜慶奎一條好嗓子就此完了。偌大的一個角兒，要不楚程老四念舊，把他請到戲曲學校裹敎戲，每月掙個二百八十，恐怕就要活活的餓死。前曾一度謠傳老慶自殺，據說他某日因與敎師蔡某（亦教生角，性頗陰險嫉妒。）閑談，蔡向他道：你一月掙多少，答云：每月百元。蔡遂譏之曰：從前一月縣一萬包銀的大角，怎麽只掙一百，像我這個樣兒的，還掙一百二哪。老慶回得家來，越想越不是味，因向聯奎說道：這個樣子不如咱們喝點烟膏矛，了却今生吧。後經家人再三勸阻，此事乃寢。平心而論，慶奎爲人，尚甚長厚，所以盛麟令歲出演黃金，能有如此美滿成績，名利雙收，載譽北返。老慶有了好兒子，自己也可以揚眉吐氣了。（一一二）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chamberlain's Reiteration: Determined to Wage War with Full National Strength; German-Soviet Pact Insufficient to Alter Anglo-French Objectives; Willing to Study Concrete Proposals <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>London: Following the establishment of the German-Soviet pact, Prime Minister Chamberlain reiterated the United Kingdom's policy in the House of Commons. All those present listened with bated breath. The Prime Minister stated, "Major events have occurred internationally in the past week. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop traveled to Moscow on September 26th, and the results were made public on the 28th. There are three main points: (1) Germany and the Soviet Union have made their fourth attempt to divide Poland and have signed an agreement mutually recognizing the definitive nature of the boundary line demarcated within Poland. This boundary line is far more advantageous to Germany than the temporary boundary line established during the previous military occupation. (2) The German and Soviet governments have issued a statement saying that various problems arising from the disintegration of Poland have been effectively resolved by both countries and that a lasting foundation for peace in Eastern Europe has been laid. For the benefit of all countries worldwide, the war between Germany and the Anglo-French powers should be ended. The German and Soviet governments should work together to ensure that this goal is quickly achieved. If this fails, the responsibility for continuing the war clearly falls on the Anglo-French powers. At that time, the German and Soviet governments will consult each other to determine the necessary measures. (3) The German and Soviet governments will establish a long-term economic agreement whereby the Soviet Union will exchange raw materials for German manufactured goods. Some quarters in our country therefore advocate that the British government must state its position. However, I do not see anything that would cause our country to change its attitude, which it deems correct. The German-Soviet pact has indeed altered the situation in Poland, but since Germany has not obtained its ultimate benefits, the British government has no need to change its objectives. In essence, we are now mobilizing all the resources and strength of the British Empire to wage a serious war, and there is no need to change course." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then reviewed the reasons why Britain entered the war and the direct causes of the war, stating that while Poland was the direct cause of the war, it was by no means the fundamental cause. The fundamental cause of this war stems from the intolerable feeling of the Anglo-French powers towards the current state of affairs in Europe, believing that there are only two options: either to allow it to be freely exposed to danger or to mobilize their troops in peacetime to defend this freedom. The measures to be taken regarding the declaration by the Soviet-German powers concerning the end of the war are now ambiguous, but the content seems to propose certain peace conditions on the one hand and threaten dire consequences if these conditions are rejected. I cannot foresee the nature of this proposal, but I can immediately say that no intimidation will cause Britain or France to abandon the purpose for which they entered this war. No one wants to continue the war a day longer than necessary, but the great powers of Britain and France are determined to end tyrannical rule and to ensure that the oaths made by governments are forever kept. Many prominent diplomats were in the gallery during the Prime Minister's speech today, including Soviet Ambassador Maisky and Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Prime Minister Chamberlain further stated that any guarantees offered by the current German government are unacceptable. This government has never valued any commitments it has accepted, violating them whenever it is advantageous. There are countless examples of this. Now, if suggestions are made again, we will learn from the past and study and test them carefully. If the war does not need to continue, no one will want to wage it senselessly for a single day, but violent acts must be stopped and governments must be held accountable for the promises they make. On this point, the vast majority of public opinion in Britain and France is determined. Thereupon, Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a summary report on the progress of the war. On the Western Front, French troops have made further progress and occupied excellent positions from which to observe German troop positions. A large number of British troops have also arrived in France to fight alongside the French army. This deployment was quite difficult but has been successfully completed, which is most gratifying. In addition, our aircraft are reconnoitering enemy positions on the French front day and night and engaging in fierce battles with enemy aircraft. As for the activities of German submarines, our navy is actively searching and attacking them. We firmly believe that once submarine defenses are strengthened, this threat can be quickly reduced. Although German submarines have continued to operate near our shores in recent weeks, no British merchant ships have been sunk. This is due to the efforts of our navy. German submarines are now attacking ships of neutral countries at a greater distance. The threat posed by their pirate ships in the South Atlantic will be dealt with according to plan. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: Reuters' parliamentary correspondent reports that members of parliament are completely indifferent to Hitler's "peace proposals." All parties admire First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill's broadcast speech on Sunday night and hope that Prime Minister Chamberlain will make similar, practical remarks today when expressing his views on the German-Soviet partition of Poland. Last night's discussion in the House of Commons on the determination expressed in the initial budget, and that the nation will bear unprecedented burdens, proves that all sectors of the country are not shrinking from the task already underway. The wartime budget bill was passed on second reading last night without dissent. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e2">Hitler's Final Gambit: To Deliver a Speech Today; To Propose Peace Plan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: Hitler will give a speech in parliament this week, probably on Wednesday. Judging from appearances, his remarks will focus on foreign affairs rather than domestic affairs. It is generally believed that Hitler will deliver his last speech offering an open door for peace negotiations with Britain. If the proposal is rejected, a protracted war will be almost inevitable. According to Italian journalists, Hitler's proposed peace includes the establishment of a small-scale Polish buffer state by Germany and the Soviet Union, entirely inhabited by Poles. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris: Reliable sources here have received credible information from the capitals of various neutral countries, stating that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has already returned to Rome with German peace proposals. The content proposes that Italy should come forward at this time to mediate. Regarding this, although there are rumors that the peace proposal to be put forward by German leader Hitler will be accompanied by threatening words, it is actually unlikely to be the case. On the contrary, Germany may even make some reasonable suggestions. This can be seen from the country's recent diplomatic activities in certain neutral countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, and Belgium. It is reported that Hitler's peace plan intends to have neutral figures present the proposals, so as to allow democratic countries to ostensibly gain a victory, and the accomplished facts within Poland will also be greatly embellished to ensure they can be recognized by the Anglo-French powers. But in any case, the Anglo-French attitude is firm and has been fully clarified by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier, and will never be changed because of this. In addition, Hitler originally invited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to visit Berlin, but because Prime Minister Mussolini was unable to spare the time, he ordered Foreign Minister Ciano to represent him.

<h3 id="e3">Ciano Returns to Rome: Italian Cabinet Meets; To Discuss Mediating Peace Issues <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Rome: It is heard that the Italian cabinet is scheduled to meet today. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano concluded his talks with Hitler yesterday and returned here at noon. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: According to a Rome Radio broadcast, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's decision to visit Berlin was to discuss solutions to the new European situation, and to establish a "just peace". The conditions are two: (1) Apart from the parts occupied by the Soviet Union, a new Polish state is to be organized as a German protectorate, and Germany's original demands are to be met. (2) A European conference is to be convened to resolve colonial and Mediterranean issues of great interest to Italy. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Milan: According to the "People's Daily" diplomatic correspondent who accompanied Italian Foreign Minister Ciano on his visit to Berlin, the Italian government's attitude is of great importance and even decisive influence in localizing the European war. To its knowledge, Italy does not want the war to spread to the Danube region, the Balkan Peninsula, the western Mediterranean, or even western Europe. However, political negotiations have never been as difficult as they have been since August this year. There are many difficulties ahead, but Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is determined and will work tirelessly. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rome: Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gaeta, wrote an article published in today's Italian Daily, making a peace appeal, stating briefly that Ciano's visit to Berlin only shows that Germany and Italy are in a new phase in a broader structure to achieve a fair peace. The warning appeals from Rome and Berlin, and timely initiatives, have been rejected, but Italy is not discouraged. Mussolini's peace movement, which began in early September, has not ended. Today is the time for the peoples and governments of all countries to seriously consider their ultimate responsibilities. Nothing irreparable has yet occurred. No country or government should reject a concept of peace based on fairness. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome: Regarding the long talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and German leader Hitler in Berlin, the newspapers here today have added lengthy commentaries. Mussolini's mouthpiece, the famous Italian journalist Gaeta, agrees with the views of the "German Diplomatic and Political Communication" and believes that German-Italian policy is a cornerstone of peace. The fact that has already been achieved is that Germany has purged the evils of the Treaty of Versailles in Eastern Europe and achieved its goals. The universal tragedy has not yet unfolded. Germany and its allies want to end the war as soon as possible. This German reorganization is entirely based on the principles of peace and justice. This new order can keep Europe permanently peaceful. Governments should carefully consider their major responsibilities and should not lightly reject this peace. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: General Goering's mouthpiece, the "Essen National Daily," published an editorial on the front page today, commenting on the rumored proposal that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will present a peace proposal on behalf of German leader Hitler. The newspaper declared two things: (1) The open cooperation between the leaders of Germany and Italy is a matter of course. (2) The declaration issued by Germany and the Soviet Union in Moscow is entirely the same as the hope Mussolini has held since the start of the war. Therefore, there is no need to hide the desire for peace of Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy, but it cannot be interpreted by the enemy as a war-weary plea for peace.

<p>New York: Former U.S. President Hoover, in a conversation with reporters from the New York World-Telegram today, predicted that Britain and France would not be defeated in this war. He said, "I believe the Allied powers will be able to defend their empire and they will be victorious. Even in the worst case, it will only be a draw. The war has only been going on for a month, but significant factors have gradually emerged. Although Britain and France are threatened by submarines and aircraft, they have the power to control the seven seas, and their manpower can defend France. They only need not risk lightly taking the offensive, because using their manpower to the full will eliminate other concerns." (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<p>Tokyo: Today, an army spokesman announced that although Japan and the Soviet Union have signed a ceasefire agreement, the Soviet Union has transferred large numbers of reinforcements and a large number of aircraft and tank units to the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo." Japan's losses in the Nomonhan Incident totaled 18,000 casualties. The losses on the Mongolian side are probably no less than those on the Japanese side. The spokesman also briefly described the process of Japan and the Soviet Union signing a ceasefire agreement, saying that Japan had consistently adhered to a policy of localization and non-expansion for the Nomonhan Incident. Due to the terrain, troop strength, and other factors, the two armies facing each other across the Khalkhyn Gol River were limited to small-scale battles. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<p>Moscow: After the Soviet Union expressed its willingness to conclude mutual assistance or non-aggression treaties with Lithuania, Latvia, and Finland, Moscow has now become a gathering place for politicians from the Baltic states. Latvian Foreign Minister Munters arrived here last night. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys was invited by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and will also arrive here today. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital: Foreign Minister Urbšys, at the invitation of the Soviet government, flew to the Latvian capital at 9:30 this morning with his entourage, preparing to change to an airmail plane there and transfer to Moscow. People here generally believe that since the Soviet government invited the Foreign Minister in a friendly spirit, the country will not make territorial or military demands on Lithuania. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: After arriving here, Latvian Foreign Minister Munters is reported to have met with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov in the evening. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys is scheduled to arrive here at 5:30 p.m. tomorrow. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu will continue talks with Molotov tomorrow. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Estonia: The Estonian President approved the Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty last night, giving the Soviet Union practical control over the Gulf of Riga. The Gulf of Riga has a railway that leads directly to Moscow, allowing Soviet trade to have a non-freezing Baltic outlet. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet also approved the treaty. According to this treaty, the Soviet Union also has the right to establish several bases and airfields on the Estonian islands of Vormsi and Hiiumaa near the Gulf of Finland. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Estonian Capital: The Soviet military delegation arrived here this morning, preparing to deploy the ports and naval bases that the Soviet Union has obtained for use in accordance with the recently signed Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<p>London: The Turkish military delegation, led by Army Chief of Staff General Kazım, arrived here at 1:00 p.m. today. The British side was welcomed at the station by General Sir Edmund Ironside. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: The Turkish military delegation is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow. According to responsible sources here, the Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement was initialed in the Turkish capital at the end of last week and will be formally signed in the near future. This is a major diplomatic victory for the Anglo-French powers. As for the mission of the Turkish military delegation, it is to discuss current issues and determine the various military measures that the three countries should take if the war spreads to the Mediterranean coast in the future. At the same time, the issue of the passage of Anglo-French warships through the Turkish Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits in wartime will also be put forward for discussion. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Moscow: Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu continued talks with People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov today and is reportedly awaiting instructions from his government. But in the afternoon, he met with British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds and French Chargé d'Affaires to the Soviet Union Payart. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Yugoslavian Capital: Informed sources here recently said that Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu's decision to go to Moscow was to negotiate with the Soviet authorities in the name of the Balkan Entente countries, in order to form a group of neutral countries in the Balkan Peninsula under Soviet auspices. The government of Yugoslavia is also said to support this matter, but as far as Yugoslavia is concerned, the Soviet side will probably demand the dissolution of all anti-Bolshevik White Russian groups and the revocation of the diplomatic treatment of the Russian Imperial Chargé d'Affaires to the South, Stremoukhov. (Note: Since the Russian Revolution, the Yugoslav government has not established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and has always recognized Stremoukhov's care of Russian interests, which has lasted for twenty years.) But according to official sources, the issue of the South recognizing the Soviet Union has not been discussed. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Abe's Policy and the Sino-Japanese Problem <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Foreign Minister Nomura delivered speeches on domestic and foreign policy at the National Governors' Conference the day before yesterday. The content of the speeches was published in yesterday's newspapers. The so-called National Governors' Conference in Japan is where central government officials clarify policies and provide guidance on measures, and where local officials report on their duties and achievements. It is more about speaking than debating, but it is an important administrative gathering. This meeting was the first such gathering since Abe's cabinet took office. Abe came to power during a parliamentary recess, so he has not yet had the opportunity to deliver a formal political speech. The speeches delivered the other day were the first expressions of the new cabinet members at an important gathering. Being the first, they should be viewed differently.</p>
<p>The main purpose of convening this conference is to implement the National General Mobilization Law. In the future, it will force unprecedented sacrifices from the Japanese people and place unprecedented burdens upon them. The operation of this lies with the central government, but its effectiveness depends on the local governments. Therefore, local officials must be gathered together and instructed face-to-face, charged with absolute loyalty and sincerity. Examining the spirit and provisions of the mobilization law, it will channel every drop of the Japanese people's blood and sweat to the public treasury, and subject every action of the Japanese people to control. It is the third year of aggression, and the strategy of quick victory has proven to be a mere illusion. Therefore, the only option is to exhaust all resources and make a final gamble in a reckless war. Therefore, we should pay serious attention to the actual achievements and the extent of the suffering of the common people after Japan convened the National Governors' Conference and implemented the National General Mobilization Law. This is even more important than the foreign policy they announced.</p>
<p>Analyzing the foreign policy portion of the speeches by Abe and Nomura, there are six main points: (1) Acknowledging that "the international situation is complex and delicate, and its trends cannot be predicted," meaning it cannot be grasped. (2) Regarding "the handling of the China Incident and the construction of a new order in East Asia" as Japan's biggest current problem; all domestic and foreign policies, as well as attitudes toward third countries and the European war, revolve around this biggest problem. (3) Explaining that they "intend to devote themselves to resolving the China Incident," and that "the fundamental policy for handling the China Incident has already been decided and will not change with cabinet changes." (4) Stating that "what Japan seeks from China is political and economic cooperation between Japan and China," and that "the ultimate goal of handling the incident is the integration of Japan, China, and Manchukuo." (5) Reporting that the so-called "new central government" in China will "be established." (6) Japan will support the establishment of this so-called "new central government" and cooperate with it, but "it would be premature to consider the establishment of the new central government as the end of the incident." The Japanese claim that they "bear the mission not only of restoring peace" but also of completing the ultimate goal of "integrating Japan, China, and Manchukuo." Beyond these six points, regarding general international matters, they routinely declare that they have no intention of excluding the economic activities of third countries in China and express the hope that third countries will abandon their policy of assisting the Chinese National Government. From now on, "they intend to implement a multi-faceted and comprehensive foreign policy based on the established policy for handling the China Incident and after fully considering the situation in Europe; all closeness, distance, friendship, and enmity will be measured by whether a third country's attitude toward China suits Japan's wishes." Regarding Germany's past efforts to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the negotiation was declared "terminated." Regarding the Soviet Union, they plan to gradually resolve outstanding issues. Regarding the United Kingdom, negotiations with the UK have been declared "failed" because the UK could not agree to Japan's demands regarding the handling of specific issues in Tianjin. Regarding the United States, they plan to continue efforts so that the United States can fully understand Japan's "true intentions."</p>
<p>After analysis, please review further.</p>
<p>In Abe and Nomura's speeches, the parts concerning Germany, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States are quite bland, as it is inappropriate for superiors to exaggerate to subordinates. Regarding general international affairs, they expound their traditional Japan-centered approach, with no new suggestions whatsoever. Regarding China and the Sino-Japanese War, they largely remain within the confines of their aggression since launching the armed invasion. However, they have made relatively new explanations in response to the changes in the times. There are points that are worth criticizing. The speeches repeatedly mentioned a new order [tizhi], but never mentioned the new order [zhixu] that has been constantly promoted for the past ten months. The so-called "new order" has never had a defined explanation from the beginning. However, in terms of literal meaning, the so-called "new order" can still be regarded as a term in international affairs, while the so-called "new system" must be regarded as a new term that should only be applied to domestic political issues. Literalism may be despised by military men, but this is the first criticism. What does the term "new system" refer to? What does the term "political cooperation" refer to? In their speeches, we find a concise explanation, which is the so-called "integration of Japan, China, and Manchukuo." Moreover, is it intended that countries become one system? What does that mean? The alliance between the United Kingdom and France is recent, but we have not heard of an integrated UK-France system. Japan, Germany, and Italy have the Anti-Comintern Pact, but we have not heard of an integrated three-nation system. The United States is the leader of the Americas. In the recent Pan-American Conference, there was even a decision on economic cooperation and a decision to maintain neutrality and help each other. We have not heard of an integrated Americas. In the distant past, Sweden and Norway once shared a king, but we have not heard of an integrated Sweden-Norway. Austria and Hungary once shared an emperor, but we have not heard of an integrated Austria-Hungary. In short, independent countries have never been called an integrated system. Therefore, Japan's desired trinity clearly intends to operate in other occupied areas of China in the same way that it has operated in the four northeastern provinces of China in recent years, making them puppets. The American-style economic cooperation is far from satisfying Japan's ultimate goal. The Anti-Comintern Pact among Japan, Germany, and Italy is certainly not enough to explain international political cooperation. This is the second criticism. Regarding Japan's so-called "handling of the China Incident," Abe and others no longer say that they will achieve their goal through military force. Moreover, they no longer expect the so-called "new central government" that they will assist in establishing to end the Sino-Japanese War. Do we dare to incur the accusation of being overly sensitive or the ridicule of forcing an interpretation? Perhaps we can suddenly realize that the "China" in Japan's so-called "integration of Japan, China, and Manchukuo" originally refers to the "China" of the "new central government," and not the "China" of the Republic of China. Therefore, they have not made a single criticism of the opposing National Government of the Republic of China. This is also why they indicate that Japan will now devote itself to the "new central government" in the occupied areas and take this as the scope of their operations. This is the third criticism. Since September 18th, the Japanese cabinet has changed repeatedly, and the so-called "fundamental policy toward China" has varied in quality. Although Abe and Nomura's speeches were detailed, they mentioned the dates whenever they discussed matters. However, they were reluctant to specify the year, date, and person who announced the so-called established policy that does not change with the cabinet. This is a smokescreen to protect their image, a vague and empty statement. If we pursue it, it is like carving a mark on a boat to find a sword. However, Abe and Nomura have clearly stated political and economic cooperation and an integrated system. What else is there to pursue? This is the fourth criticism.</p>
<p>When people discuss Japan's peace or war, and Japan's sincerity or insincerity, opinions vary and cannot be completely the same. It is fine to stop at empty talk, but if discussing reality, then only using subjective views to interpret everything without obtaining objective facts to prove everything is extremely risky. Regarding what Abe and Nomura have expressed, we do not want to take it as a new target for criticizing aggression, but we sincerely hope that those who study the Sino-Japanese problem will take it as new material for argumentation. In our view, without presuming to infer how distant and vague the future of resolving the Sino-Japanese problem is, we can infer from what Abe and Nomura have expressed that Abe's cabinet in Japan is not one that can resolve the Sino-Japanese problem.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Swedish Merchant Ship "Cannon" Sunk by German Submarine; Violation of Neutrality Outrages Swedish Public; Mysterious German Warship Discovered in South Atlantic; British Ship Sunk En Route to Brazil <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - The Swedish merchant ship "Cannon," en route to Antwerp, Belgium, was sunk by a torpedo from a German submarine in the sea near Skagerrak, between Norway and Jutland. Eighteen crew members have been rescued by a Danish ship. The German submarine first took the captain of the "Cannon" and two other Swedes on board, then fired a torpedo and submerged for seven hours. This incident was published by a local newspaper after the captain of the "Cannon" arrived in Helsingborg. According to the captain, the "Cannon" was intercepted by the submarine on Saturday. The captain and two others were forced to board the submarine, while a German officer and three soldiers boarded the "Cannon," ordering the crew to take to the boats. At that time, a British submarine appeared, and the German submarine left the captain and the Swedes on board and submerged for seven hours. While submerged, the submarine fired three torpedoes. According to the German submarine captain, the torpedoes must have sunk the British submarine. The "Cannon" sank rapidly after being hit by the torpedo, so the German officers and soldiers who boarded for inspection did not have time to return to the submarine and spent the night in a lifeboat. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - After the Swedish ship "Cannon" was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine, public opinion in Sweden was in an uproar, demanding that the authorities take strong measures to protect Swedish ships. Regarding this point, the organ of the Swedish Conservative Party, citing responsible sources, stated that the authorities, due to the acts of other countries in seizing the Latvian ship "Imanta" and attempting to force Swedish ships to leave territorial waters, violating neutrality, have decided to dispatch the navy in Swedish territorial waters to escort ships soon and will adopt more stringent measures to patrol territorial waters with aircraft. The Arlanda newspaper commented that sinking the ships of the Scandinavian countries cannot be said to have reduced Britain's ability to continue the war. So what is the purpose of committing atrocities against neutral ships? In this situation, it is inevitable for neutral countries to send naval vessels to guard merchant ships. If Sweden wants to maintain neutrality in its territorial waters, it must back up its words with force. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland - The Zurich Daily News recently published a report from Stockholm, Sweden, stating that a German aircraft, flying over the intersection of Swedish territorial waters and international waters, attacked several Swedish national ships with machine guns, intending to force them to sail elsewhere for inspection. However, it was prevented by two Swedish aircraft. All those in the Swedish shipping industry were extremely shocked by these acts of violating neutrality. The government has instructed the ambassador in Berlin to lodge a protest with the German government. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - Today, the Swedish Navy Commander-in-Chief has warned all Swedish merchant ships that they must sail along the coastline within Swedish territorial waters before gathering for escort by Swedish warships. The warships' instructions must be strictly followed, and those who violate them will face serious dangers and suffer the consequences. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>London - News was received here a moment ago from Copenhagen, stating that a German armed fishing boat, which entered Swedish territorial waters without permission yesterday, was attacked by two Swedish aircraft and immediately sailed into international waters. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>London - The British Admiralty yesterday issued a warning to Allied ships in the South Atlantic, stating that there is a mysterious German warship lurking in the area. The British ship "Clement" (5,050 tons) was sunk 70 miles off the coast of Brazil while en route from New York to Brazil. The crew have all been rescued and have landed at a port in Brazil. The Admiralty has not been able to confirm that the "Clement" was sunk by a German pocket battleship. Two of Germany's three pocket battleships are currently under repair. If the "Clement" was sunk by a German pocket battleship, then this pocket battleship must have slipped through the British blockade. News from the Brazilian side stated that the incident was caused by the German pocket battleship "Admiral Scheer." The location where the "Clement" was sunk is within the so-called "security zone" in the Pan-American Conference. The ship left New York on September 29th, bound for Brazil in South America, with a total of 48 people on board. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - Sixteen crew members of the British merchant ship "Clement," which was sunk by a German submarine, were rescued today by the Brazilian ship "Itatinga." They were all in an open lifeboat off the coast of Brazil. According to the rescued, except for the captain, who was taken away by the German submarine, the remaining crew members escaped in four lifeboats before the "Clement" sank. However, apart from those rescued, the other three lifeboats have not been found despite searches. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the discovery of an armed enemy warship in the South Pacific, naval critics claim that before the war, the British ships stationed in the Americas and the West Indies included the "Berwick," "York," and "Exeter," each equipped with eight-inch guns, and the "Ajax" and "Orion," each equipped with six-inch guns. Therefore, if one of the German cruisers "Admiral Graf Spee" and "Admiral Hipper" escapes the northern blockade and inflicts damage on the seas, the strength of the above-mentioned ships is fully sufficient to deal with it. Although it may take some time for the British Navy to search for a lone enemy ship in the ocean, today's Germany no longer has the facilities to maintain this kind of lone warship at sea as it did in 1914. At that time, Germany had many bases in the Pacific Ocean and had well-organized coal ships and supply ships, and there was also the Far East Fleet led by Admiral Graf Spee. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - German naval officers announced yesterday that a German submarine encountered the Danish ship "Vendia" on September 30th and immediately notified it to stop sailing for a search by the German navy. The Danish ship attempted to evade the search, and the German submarine stopped it. The ship then attempted to ram the submarine. This behavior is a violation of international law. The submarine fired a torpedo and sank it, rescued the crew members who fell into the water, and transferred them to another Danish ship. (Haitong, 3rd)</p>

Allied aircraft are fighting German aircraft in the skies over the German front lines every day. It is heard that the German side is now making every effort to prevent the reconnaissance flights of British and French aircraft.

<h3 id="e16">The Stability of Changsha and Its Outskirts: Chinese Troops Achieve Success in Successive Battles, Recapturing Shangshih, Fulindianpu, and Liqiao; Continuing to Advance Towards the South Bank of the Miluo River; Also Recapturing Shiziling South of Fengxin <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Changsha: Chinese troops in northern Hunan have recaptured key points such as Fulindianpu and Liqiao. On the 2nd, they first captured Shangshih, and that evening surrounded and annihilated most of the remaining Japanese forces in the vicinity. The Chinese army then took advantage of the victory to pursue and attack the Japanese troops who had retreated to the area of Malinqiao (30 miles south of Fulindianpu) and Qingshan (southwest of Fulindianpu). The Japanese troops were extremely disorganized and retreated north in disarray. The Chinese army then recaptured Liqiao at 2:00 AM on the 2nd, and taking advantage of the bright moonlight and stars, bravely advanced eastward, officially capturing Fulindianpu at dawn on the 3rd. Chinese pursuit troops are currently continuing to advance towards the south bank of the Miluo River. The defeated Japanese troops are in a very pathetic state, abandoning a large amount of baggage along the way. The Chinese army is simultaneously clearing the spoils of war and comforting displaced people. Amidst the sounds of victory, the military and civilians are becoming even closer. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to today's news from the Guilin branch of the military headquarters, since the Chinese army launched a counterattack on September 30th, the arrogance of the Japanese army in the battle for the outskirts of Changsha has greatly declined. Since the Chinese army recaptured Sanduoqiao, the Japanese troops in Qingshan have been under siege by the Chinese army. However, the fighting in the Sanduoqiao area is still ongoing today. Furthermore, since the Chinese army launched its counterattack, it has not only been able to cut the Japanese troops in the mountains northwest of Changsha into several sections, but also to rely on advantageous terrain to annihilate the Japanese troops in separate units. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, Chinese-language newspapers prominently published news of the counterattacks by Chinese troops north of the Yangtze River and in the Northeast. It is reported that Chinese troops on the highway northeast of Changsha and on the railway north of it launched a vigorous counterattack on October 1st. Important commanders personally went to the front line to supervise the battle. Chinese troops on the highway have captured Shangshih and forced the Japanese troops there to retreat northwest towards the railway. Chinese troops along the railway have captured Huanggongqiao (transliteration) northeast of Qiaotouyi and Lijiatang (transliteration) northwest of Fulindianpu. At the same time, Chinese mobile units are currently vigorously harassing the rear flanks of the Japanese army. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Chinese army stated this afternoon in a conversation with reporters that the current battle for Changsha is a re-enactment of the battle of southern Shanxi. The Chinese army will use the dense mountains northeast of Changsha to harass the Japanese troops currently advancing south towards Changsha, just as the Chinese army used the Zhongtiao and Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi to prevent Japan from gaining a foothold in that area. The spokesman also reviewed the course of the battle in northern Hunan, saying that the Chinese army had built solid defensive lines on the south bank of the Xinqiang River and the Miluo River. However, after the Japanese army landed east of Dongting Lake, the western flank of the Chinese troops defending the Xinqiang and Miluo positions was threatened. The Chinese troops in northern Hunan did not retreat towards Changsha, but retreated southeast into the mountains northeast of Changsha, defending the Mufu Mountains. Now the Chinese army has built deep trenches and high ramparts in the mountains near Zhulin, Pingjiang, Xiushui, and Liuyang, allowing the Japanese army to advance south towards Changsha, and then continuously attacking the flanks of the Japanese army along the highway. Although the Japanese army decided to attack Changsha with more than 100,000 troops, it has now been blocked north of Changsha due to the Chinese army's mobile strategy. This strategy of the Chinese army has proven effective in the battle of southern Shanxi. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Gaoan: After Ganfang was recaptured by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops retreated northwest to Hanqiao Zhaocun. The Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the afternoon of the 2nd, resulting in a fierce battle. Chinese officers and soldiers fought bravely, disregarding their own safety, and killed countless Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops were terrified and released a large amount of poison gas in an attempt to reverse the situation. The Chinese army launched an attack through the poison gas, and the bloody battle continued until the evening. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Shiziling (south of Fengxin) on the morning of the 2nd, engaging in a fierce battle with the "Jun Fukui Unit" for three hours, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray, and Shiziling was declared recaptured. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<p>Changsha: The Japanese troops in northern Hunan have suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by the Chinese army for several days.

<p>Hengyang: According to a phone call from Changsha at 4:30 PM, the Chinese army recaptured Ganfang, west of Shangfu, on the evening of the 1st. The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties. When the Chinese army launched its attack, it captured three puppet soldiers who claimed to be from the Northeast. Because the Japanese soldiers were afraid of death, they were used as the vanguard. The Japanese army's defeat in this battle was extremely pathetic. Not only were the Japanese corpses not collected, but the wounded soldiers were also abandoned on the battlefield. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Hengyang: According to a phone call from Changsha at 1:00 PM, the Chinese army is in an advantageous position in the outskirts of Changsha. The defensive lines have become increasingly stable in the past two days. Yonganshi is still in the hands of the Chinese army. (2nd dispatch)</p>

<p>Fancheng: The Chinese army in central Hubei is launching attacks on the Japanese in two lines, encircling and outflanking them. Although the Japanese troops are able to rely on their fortifications to defend their strongholds, their lines of communication are cut off by the Chinese. In the current situation in central Hubei, the Japanese are still at a disadvantage. A certain unit of the Chinese army is pressing forward at Yonglong River and Yangjiaze, besieging Qianjiang. The Dawangmiao area southwest of Zhongxiang has also been occupied by the Chinese. The area east of Jiukou Bridge, Huangjiaji, and the mountains north of Yangzi in Zhongxiang are all areas where brave Chinese soldiers are active. The Japanese troops in the Zhongxiang area have not yet escaped the control of the Chinese. In northern Hubei, a certain unit of the Chinese army surrounded Zhe River on the 29th, destroying many sections of the highway. Two other units advanced towards Jingzhong, one approaching Suicheng and attacking Jiangjiagang north of Sui on the night of the 29th, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers and capturing many rifles. The Chinese suffered slight casualties. At the southeastern foot of the Tongbai Mountains, the Chinese have occupied Luotuodian, reaching the area east of Ta'erwan, driving out the Japanese outer defenses and bombarding them with mortars, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese. East of the Tongbai Mountains, the Chinese are advancing. (3rd dispatch)</p>

Although the moonlight was bright tonight, there was a thick fog. After the five waves of Japanese planes entered Sichuan, they proceeded west through the fog. The first two waves passed Chongqing and did not stop, continuing to fly west to attack Luxian and Yibin. The third and fourth waves approached the sky over Chongqing and circled for a long time before continuing to fly west. After that, the fifth wave of Japanese planes also followed, passing Chongqing and heading west. These five waves of Japanese planes then successively bombed Luxian and Yibin in western Sichuan. The losses are not yet known. After dropping their bombs, the Japanese planes turned back and flew east along the river, turning south again after passing Chongqing. The local air defense command issued an emergency alarm, which was only lifted this morning. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<p>Changde: Nine Japanese planes flew over Tao on the afternoon of the 3rd, disrupting the area to the west. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Hengyang: According to reports, at 8:40 AM this morning, one Japanese plane flew over Xiangtan and dropped bombs in Liuyang before fleeing. The Chinese side suffered no losses. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chengdu: (Delayed) The Japanese planes attacked again on Sunday, and launched their fourth air raid on Chengdu last night. They flew away at 1:10 AM this morning after dropping bombs. However, the all-clear signal was not given until 4:30 AM, for fear that the Japanese planes might return. Those who did not leave the city when the first alert was issued spent most of the night in air raid shelters. The Japanese planes bombed in three waves, and the last wave of bombing caused the most damage, as most people thought the air raid was over. However, the bombs all landed in empty fields half a mile outside the South Gate, causing very few casualties. A Reuters reporter visited the area outside the South Gate today and saw one or two rafters of farmhouses destroyed and several innocent civilians killed or injured, including a woman and her baby, who both died.

<p>San Pedro: Naval officials announced last night that 45 warships sailing to Hawaii today will be stationed there permanently, and that the US fleet's patrol area will include the Pacific Ocean from Alaska to the equator. Tokyo newspapers have all published news of the US fleet's movements, calling it a "military demonstration" against Japan. Rear Admiral Andrews, who commands the fleet sailing to Hawaii, is a well-known naval strategist. Rear Admiral Andrews is traveling on the aircraft carrier "USS Saratoga," which carries 80 aircraft. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Manila: In its editorial today, the Philippine "Hochi Shimbun" predicted that the Far East would soon become a major theater in world history for a second time. Although the attention of the general public in the world is currently attracted by the European war and its diplomatic activities, in the Far East, judging from the fragments of news we have obtained, there is also a drama of similar greatness waiting to be performed. For example, the US dispatch of the aircraft carrier "Langley" and 14 aircraft here, and the continued dispatch of 45 warships to Honolulu, should be regarded as one preparation. At the same time, Singapore's air power has doubled compared to a few weeks ago. (3rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Most Japanese newspapers today prominently published news that the US naval authorities have dispatched 45 warships to Hawaii for exercises, with headlines such as "US Armed Demonstration Against Japan." Retired Japanese Rear Admiral Kaneseki Gunpei published a fierce article in the "Bungei Shunju" magazine, suggesting that the US sell Guam (an American outpost in the Pacific, 1,300 miles from Yokohama) to Japan. Rear Admiral Kaneseki criticized the US attitude towards the Sino-Japanese War as "hypocritical." He said, "The US often uses humanity and fairness to promote its views on world events, but in fact, its policy is greedy and selfish, the same as its policy during the First World War. The tense relationship between the US and Japan hinges on whether the US will risk war with Japan over the China Incident. Some people think that the China Incident can be resolved without a US-Japan war, while others assert that the China Incident cannot be resolved without a battle between the two Pacific powers. I believe that the US will not risk war with Japan, because the US will gain more than it loses." Rear Admiral Kaneseki continued, "Japan must abolish the Nine-Power Treaty, which was signed under 'bad air and oppression,' just as Japan abolished the Washington Naval Treaty, which permanently limited Japan's naval inferiority." However, the abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty depends entirely on the US attitude towards Japan. If the Washington administration does not change its current hostile attitude towards Japan and the Japanese people, it will inevitably lead to a US-Japan crisis. There is no need to deny this. The Japanese people need not be alarmed by the US-Japan crisis, because Japan has already prepared a policy to deal with emergencies. Some people are deeply afraid of war in the Pacific, but they can rest easy, because the Imperial Navy can compete with any navy in the world. When the Japanese Navy controls the western Pacific, it will not be easy for the US fleet to attack Japan. I hope that the US can abandon its suspicions about Japan and adopt a more moderate attitude to resolve the issue of American rights in China through negotiations with Japan. If so, Japan will respond to the US with pleasure, and then the issue of the rights of both parties in China and the issue of security after the complete independence of the Philippines will be easily resolved. After the rights of the US and Japan are clarified, the need for fortifications on Guam can be eliminated. I think for the sake of US-Japan friendship, it would be better for the US to sell Guam to Japan, so that Japan can defend it and protect the peace of the Pacific."

<h3 id="e27">Neutrality Act Amendment: Fierce Debate in US Senate; Pittman Speaks Out that Arms Embargo Should Be Abolished; Says US is Partly to Blame for Japanese Army Massacres in China <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Washington: Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman today moved in the Senate that the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Act be passed. One of the most important debates in US Congressional history has begun from this point. The chamber and the gallery were extremely crowded, with hardly any space. Listening to the debate between Pittman and Republican opponent Senator Borah, (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Pittman, the original proposer, first gave a speech explaining the proposal, and strongly argued that the arms embargo clause must be abolished. His key words were: "Some say that prohibiting the sale of arms to the belligerent countries can make us not bear any responsibility for the killing of human lives during the war. This kind of idea is actually wrong. Taking the Far East war as an example, we have indirectly participated in the Japanese army's killing of Chinese people in Chinese territory." This is because Japan is buying various raw materials from our country to manufacture military supplies for fighting against China. After Pittman finished speaking, Republican Senator and member of the Foreign Relations Committee Borah followed with a speech, vehemently opposing the abolition of the arms embargo clause in the name of the opposition, believing that this move would only make it impossible for the United States to refuse to provide assistance to the democratic countries in Europe. During Borah's speech, Pittman repeatedly interrupted to refute, and the two sides fiercely debated. For example, Borah once said that the current Neutrality Act is "neutral" in wording, but Pittman said that this law is not neutral in practice. In addition, although this law prohibits the shipment of arms to the belligerent countries, the Soviet Union, Italy, and even Romania can still purchase military supplies from the United States to ship to Germany. The meeting was temporarily adjourned at 3:45 PM, and the meeting will continue at noon tomorrow, and it was decided that meetings will be held daily from noon to 5:00 PM. It has not been determined when the debate will end. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Mr. Pittman's Speech <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Speaking in his capacity as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Pittman stated, "The existing arms embargo clause in the Neutrality Act favors Germany and obviously discriminates against other belligerent nations. The amendment proposing to abolish this clause is one of the most important bills ever submitted to Congress by the government. It can enable the United States to avoid being drawn into the vortex of the European war. At this moment, the entire world is threatened by the scourge of war across the Atlantic, the severity of which is unprecedented in human history. The world is in a state of panic, filled with fear and doubt. However, if we can adhere to the principles of international law and prevent our people from putting themselves in danger, then there seems to be no sufficient reason to fear repeating the mistakes of the last European war and being drawn into the whirlpool of war." Those who oppose the abolition of the arms embargo often believe that Anglo-American shipping will be controlled by Britain and France in the future, and therefore allowing arms exports would only benefit these countries. However, Germany is a continental power and can obtain arms supplies from Italy, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Romania, and other countries. Wouldn't prohibiting arms exports simply benefit Germany? Moreover, when the United States implemented the current Neutrality Act, Germany could still obtain various arms from the United States through other neutral countries. President Roosevelt has issued a declaration stating that he will do everything possible to keep the United States out of the European war. I firmly believe in this declaration by the President and dare to assert that even after the Neutrality Act is amended, the President will never abuse the powers conferred by this law. In short, even if we restrict belligerent nations from purchasing arms from our country, we may not be able to maintain neutrality or fairness. This is abundantly clear. As for the navigation of our own ships overseas, we must prohibit them from carrying goods to belligerent nations. If our ships do not carry goods for belligerent nations, and all belligerent nations know this, then these countries will have no excuse to attack American ships on the high seas, resulting in the loss of American sailors' lives. It must be remembered that the reason the United States joined the war during the last European war was precisely because American sailors were illegally and inhumanely harmed on the high seas. Who knows if Germany, using the pretext that its submarines could not safely surface to intercept contraband carried by other countries' merchant ships, might re-implement its 1917 policy and indiscriminately launch attacks when necessary? Who knows if, after a protracted war, the belligerent nations, facing increasingly dire circumstances, might not resort to any means to destroy other countries' ships and their contraband? Some say that prohibiting the sale of arms to belligerent nations can absolve us of any responsibility for the wartime killing of human lives. This view is incorrect. Taking the Far Eastern war as an example, we are indirectly participating in the Japanese army's killing of Chinese people in China, because Japan is purchasing various raw materials from our country to manufacture arms for use in the war against China.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the amendment I propose also advocates granting belligerent nations commercial credit loans of up to ninety days. This is a perfectly legitimate approach, as it is practically equivalent to cash transactions and does not conflict with the Johnson Act. (Note: The Johnson Act stipulates that countries that have not repaid the principal and interest on their war debts cannot borrow money in the United States, but former Attorney General Cummings ruled in 1934 that the Johnson Act does not apply to ordinary commercial transactions.) After the Neutrality Act is amended, our country's shipping industry will inevitably be affected to some extent. To compensate for the losses, shipping companies can appropriately increase fares on Pacific and South Atlantic routes. "In short, no matter what impact the new Neutrality Act may have on our country's shipping industry, no patriotic American citizen will oppose making this sacrifice. Weighing the pros and cons, rather than allowing our merchant ships to carry goods for belligerent nations at risk, it is better for our government to bear the losses caused by suspending this trade. Therefore, our merchant ships must suspend this business during wartime, without a doubt," he said. (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<p>Isolationist leader Senator Borah, a Republican, rose to oppose the bill and read a lengthy prepared speech, saying that Europeans now see the US authorities' proposal to amend the Neutrality Act as an attempt to help Britain and France resist Nazism. "If we change the law and can transport arms to supply Britain and France to meet their urgent needs, then I do not know how we will refuse to send troops to relieve their plight if Britain and France face even greater needs in the future. We may have to respond at that time, which I am very doubtful about." The reasons for the original Neutrality Act were America's desire not to be involved in European disputes and the humanitarian sentiment against providing weapons to belligerent nations to seek profit. As for the claim that the arms embargo has not been effectively implemented, that is not true, because arms manufacturers are now very active in trying to repeal the current embargo, which shows that the embargo is indeed effective," he said.

<p>Panama City: Yesterday, the Pan-American Conference passed a resolution designating a 300-mile zone along the American coast as a "safety zone." Henceforth, belligerent nations will not be allowed to take any action within this area. The resolution will be known as the "Declaration of Panama." This "safety zone" includes the area within 300 miles of the American coast. The countries attending the Pan-American Conference will each be responsible for patrolling within their respective areas. The implementation of this declaration will enable the American countries to avoid war and maintain neutrality. (Associated Press Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Panama City: The Pan-American Conference held a closed-door plenary session today and decided to issue a declaration of neutrality and the "Declaration of Panama" (i.e., the declaration on delineating a "continental sea" around the Americas as a safety zone), which will be submitted to a public plenary session this evening for a vote. The "Declaration of Panama" proposes that the warships and aircraft of the American republics patrol the "continental sea" to protect the shipping of those countries from attacks by the belligerent nations' vessels. The boundaries of the "continental sea" on the Atlantic side extend from the point where the Canadian Federation borders the United States, passing through the United States, Cuba, the British Bermuda Islands, to the Central American Sea. The width of the "continental sea" is 300 miles, sloping south to the intersection of 60 degrees west longitude and 20 degrees north latitude, including the French islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique. Then, along the South American coastline, it meanders south to the Brazilian Sea, where the width is again set at 300 miles, to the intersection of 24 degrees west longitude and 5 degrees north latitude, which is the point closest to the continents of Europe and Africa. Further south to the Argentinian Sea, the width is set at 100 miles, and then it turns into the Pacific Ocean at Cape Horn, the end of South America. The width of the continental sea on the Chilean Sea is set at about 50 miles, going north to the coasts of Ecuador and Colombia, and then widening its width to include the Galapagos Islands within the "continental sea." From there to the north, it restores the width of 300 miles, and ends at the border between the United States and the Canadian Federation. As for the declaration of neutrality, it involves the issue of wartime contraband and proposes the establishment of a permanent body in Washington to resolve various issues related to neutrality. According to a representative of a certain country, this declaration must express a desire, within the realm of possibility, to show that the American countries sympathize with those countries that defend the ideals of democracy, in order to subtly hint at Germany.

<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: In the past week, Zhejiang's Chinese army's units, such as the ×× Division, have crossed the Qiantang River from somewhere and arrived in the vicinity of Hangzhou, gradually advancing towards Jiahu and other areas. The current situation in the three areas of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou is investigated and recorded below.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Area</p>
<p>When the Chinese army's ×× Division on the south bank of the front line Jiangnan was crossing the Qiantang River the other day, it was spotted by the Japanese army, who immediately fired with machine guns. The Chinese army immediately responded calmly and was bombarded with small steel cannons by the Chinese army on the south bank. After a fierce battle of about three hours, the Chinese army was able to reach the north bank safely. Along the Hangyu Highway, large and small battles have occurred frequently in the past three days. On the Mid-Autumn Festival, six trucks were seen transporting Japanese soldiers' corpses that were transported from Yu following the highway to Hangzhou. Near Haiying Qibao and other places, Chinese positions were invaded by the Japanese army on the Mid-Autumn Festival. The Chinese army's ×× Division's ×× Brigade cooperated in a fierce attack, and after a half-day of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was completely wiped out by the Chinese army. The Chinese army along the Jinghang National Highway has been in contact with the Japanese army many times in the past half month. For example, on September 20, the Chinese army in the Sandun area attacked the nearby Japanese garrison, and after a day and night of fierce fighting, more than 100 Japanese soldiers were killed. On the morning of the 23rd, four trucks of Japanese soldiers passed through the Sanqiaopu area. The Chinese army in the area had heard the news in advance and ambushed themselves by the roadside. When the Japanese army drove past, they threw explosives. All Japanese soldiers and vehicles were destroyed. Later, the Japanese army in Hangzhou heard the news and sent troops to search, but found nothing.</p>
<p>Jiaxing Area</p>
<p>The Chinese army in Haiyan has recovered the important base of ×× that fell last year. Therefore, those who cross the Qiantang River to western Zhejiang all follow the waterway there. In Jiaxing, after the assassination of the puppet governor Shen Hanqing, the Japanese army stationed in He ordered the puppet acting governor Dong Kaixiong (Fengwei) to strictly organize the baojia system and restrict his subordinates from going out. Recently, he even dispatched troops to guard the key points of the city. Although the Japanese army was so vigilant, the Chinese army still repeatedly approached the city walls in the past three days. On September 30, the Chinese and Japanese armies had contact near the Dongzhakou outside the eastern gate of Hejiao. Many Japanese soldiers were killed. The Chinese army in the Guojie Township area also attacked the Japanese airfield late at night on the same day. The two sides fought fiercely until dawn, but the outcome is unknown. There have also been battles in the four suburbs of Pinghu for several days. Therefore, the residents in the area can hear clear gunshots every night, but the location is unknown. The Chinese army near Tongxiang has not been able to move due to environmental reasons, but there have been more than 20 great victories in the past half month due to the Japanese army's invasion. The number of Japanese soldiers in Jiashan is very small, so the four villages have not been disturbed recently. From the 1st of this month, it has been widely rumored inside and outside the city that the Japanese side will dispatch a large number of troops to the four villages, such as Xitang and Tianrenzhuang, to carry out the so-called "pacification" work, so people's hearts are very panicked.</p>
<p>Huzhou Area</p>
<p>Last month, the Chinese army in Huzhou attacked the first town of Nanxun in the county in four directions, killing and capturing many people, and recovered the town. The Japanese army in Wuzhen is now completely surrounded by the Chinese army and has no way out. Therefore, it is said that the Chinese army has started the annihilation war since the day before yesterday. The situation is unclear due to traffic conditions. Since September 30, the Chinese army in the four suburbs of Xinshi has been ordered to dig field trenches and various defensive works. The Japanese side sent four or five aircraft to hover and reconnoiter near the town for a whole day.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in the occupied areas is very strict in searching for newspapers published in Shanghai that uphold justice. If anyone carries them or uses them to wrap objects to the occupied areas, they will be executed if they are found. In Jiaxing, many people have died tragically because of this.</p>

<p>Nantong Correspondence: Since the encirclement and attack by various troops in this area began on September 17, the troops have been engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army every day. It is estimated that at dawn on the 18th, the × battalion of the × regiment attacked Yuxi Alley. They fought for five hours. Because the Japanese army stubbornly resisted with fortifications and the Chinese army had no heavy weapons, they failed. They reluctantly withdrew at 11:00 AM. At 12:00 AM on the 18th, Battalion Commander Feng personally led the Second and Third Companies and the Fourth Company of the Nantong Regiment to attack Yuxi again, destroying all the barricade gates on the main roads. Finally, the Japanese army retreated into the basement. At the entrance of the basement, they fired machine guns indiscriminately. After a stalemate for four hours, they were unable to succeed. They had no choice but to burn down the Japanese barracks and withdraw. At 3:00 PM on the 19th, more than 100 Japanese soldiers from Jinsha came to reinforce Yuxi. They were ambushed by the Chinese army's Feng Battalion three miles northwest of Yuxi. After a fierce battle of three hours, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. In the above three battles, it is estimated that one Japanese officer and four soldiers were killed and a dozen were wounded. The Chinese army also suffered four or five casualties. The troops of the × Brigade besieging Jinsha attacked the north gate of Jinsha at dawn on the 18th. After two hours of fierce fighting, they failed and withdrew to the periphery of Jinsha. At noon on the 19th, when the Japanese army in Jinsha dispatched to Jinyu Town, they fought fiercely with the Chinese army for several hours, killing several Japanese soldiers. The brigade also suffered some casualties. All areas are still surrounded by the Chinese army.</p>

<p>Haining Correspondence: The Japanese army in Haining only occupies the three traffic checkpoints of Chang'an, Xieqiao, and Xiashi. The puppet county government is still located in Xiashi. The other day, the Chinese army's ××× Division suddenly took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness to counterattack Chang'an, setting fire to the Japanese army's office in the Chang'an District. The Japanese army fled in a panic to Xiashi, with five or six killed or injured in the retreat, and more puppet police officers killed. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway tracks east of Chang'an were dug up by the Chinese army for 20 zhang. Therefore, passengers to Shanghai are blocked and have to return because the train only goes to Jiaxing.

<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Japanese army's Hiroya, U, Ishikawa, and other units in this county recently forcibly encircled the open space from Qianwanli Bridge to Xinmin Bridge, and drove iron wire into the ground all around. They also lured hundreds of Chinese workers to work day and night to speed up the construction of military warehouses. The work is extremely mysterious, and the nearby streets are often placed under partial martial law, prohibiting traffic. According to those working inside, the construction materials and construction methods used by the Japanese army are very simple. Based on this, it can be seen that the Japanese army's power in Su is difficult to last. At present, only two warehouses for gasoline and automobiles have been built (the former is built north of the Gengsheng Hospital, and the latter is built opposite the Huayuan Hotel). It is said that other warehouses for food, firearms, and clothing will be completed in mid-month.</p>

<p>Li Mingyang, the commander-in-chief of the Lu-Su-Wan Border Area Guerrilla Forces, recently returned to his headquarters after inspecting the defenses on the front line. According to his talk, "China must go through the stage of a major counteroffensive to achieve final victory. Based on the observation of various situations at home and abroad, China is not far from the period of general counteroffensive, so final victory is also imminent." He continued, "When he first arrived in northern Jiangsu last year, he saw that the local troops had different organizations and no case systems, which had little effect on the war of resistance. If a counteroffensive order was issued, it would be difficult to unify command. Therefore, he gathered guerrilla teams with patriotic righteousness and considerable discipline, rectified and reorganized them, and prepared for war day and night. As of today, the strength has exceeded 100,000, and they are densely deployed in the key points of various counties in northern Jiangsu. There are the First Column Commander Ding Jutang, the Second Column Commander Yan Xiuwu, the Third Column Commander Chen Caifu, the Fourth Column Commander Lu Zhoufang, and other units, winding for hundreds of miles, with layers of guns and artillery and soldiers everywhere. The defensive works are very solid, and if the enemy invades, they will be given a major blow."</p>
<h3 id="e37">The Price of Paper in Hong Kong Rises Sharply; Affected by the European War, the Source Is Short; British Newspapers Implement a Reduction in the Number of Pages <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: In the past few days, the price of paper in Hong Kong has soared, with the price of newsprint for printing newspapers rising the most. The price has doubled compared to before the European situation changed. According to sources in the paper industry, the most common sources of newspaper paper used in Hong Kong in the past were Germany, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Finland, and Canada, with Germany and Czechoslovakia being the main ones. For example, the German Paper Company and the Chinese Commercial Bank of Czechoslovakia accounted for a very large proportion of the newspaper supply in Hong Kong in the past. Since Britain and France declared war on Germany, the source has been cut off. Moreover, in the past two months, the number of newspapers shipped to Hong Kong by German and Czech paper companies has been reduced to a very small number.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the soaring wartime paper prices in Hong Kong: (1) Due to the shortage of sources, only Norway and Finland have goods coming to Hong Kong. The arrival of future goods will also take a considerable amount of time. (2) According to the approximate estimate, the stock of paper in Hong Kong can only be used for three months for the entire port. (3) Even if there are goods coming, the price of paper may not be able to recover, because the current costs, freight, and insurance fees have increased significantly compared to the past. (4) The source is scarce, and people are scrambling to buy wholesale, which is also one of the reasons for the rising paper prices.</p>
<p>The current price of each knife (printing 1,000 large newspapers) is between HK$7.5 and HK$8. In the past, each knife was only HK$3.6, and the price has doubled. Therefore, the cost of an ordinary newspaper, formerly about 3.67 cents, is now 6 or 7 cents.</p>
<p>At present, in order to remedy the business situation due to the soaring paper prices, the major newspapers in Hong Kong are mostly planning to reduce the number of pages. For example, the English-language "Hong Kong Telegraph" has reduced one page, and the "Deccan Herald" is also planning to reduce one page. As for the small newspapers with only one page, they are planning to increase the selling price from one cent to two cents, or reduce a large page to half a page.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (V): The United States Also Practices a Laissez-Faire System <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(2) The United States of America has three types of institutions for training elementary school teachers: (1) normal schools; (2) normal departments of senior high schools; and (3) various training courses. Normal schools recruit high school graduates, and some offer studies of one to four years, with two years being the norm. Women make up the majority of students. In 1930, there were 66 state-run normal schools, 26 municipal normal schools, 47 county-run normal schools, and 58 private normal schools. In addition, there were 34 specialized teacher training schools, including 6 private ones. The trend is for normal schools to decrease and specialized teacher training schools to increase. In other words, the length of study at normal schools is being extended, so that students will not only be elementary school teachers in the future, but will also be promoted to become supervisors, heads of academic affairs, and secondary school teachers. Most normal schools have attached elementary schools, or local elementary schools are used as substitutes, for students to practice. The subjects and courses are determined by the school authorities themselves, so the talents and experience of the principals must be abundant. At the same time, the curriculum standards are not determined by government offices, but by teacher conferences or academic affairs director conferences, so uniformity cannot be expected. The teacher training institutions for secondary schools in the United States can also be said to be extremely complex. To mention the main ones: (1) The College of Education of the University recruits graduates from the old-style four-year secondary schools and graduates from the new-style senior high schools, studies for four years, and awards a bachelor's degree, making them secondary school teachers. The School of Education of the University of Chicago in Chicago and The Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City are typical of this type of teacher education. For the convenience of students' observation, experimentation, and research, these schools also have attached kindergartens, elementary schools, and higher elementary schools. In addition, in smaller universities, there are also those who only require students to attend courses on education law and teaching methods to issue a teacher's license. (2) Specialized teacher training schools have the same admission qualifications as other universities, that is, they also recruit graduates from old and new-style senior high schools, so those who complete the curriculum are awarded a degree, but the length of study varies depending on the subject. For example, the technical subjects such as music and home economics are three years, while the academic subjects are four years. State-run schools also have attached kindergartens and elementary schools, and it is a common phenomenon to use other secondary schools for observation and field practice. Although teacher education in the United States and Britain is valued by their people, the schools themselves are not subject to any restrictions from the state, and the acquisition of qualifications for elementary and secondary school teachers is not in an absolutely dominant position. The reasons are: (1) Most of the elementary and secondary schools in the United States and Britain are established by private individuals and local authorities, and it seems difficult for the central government to intervene in the appointment of teachers. Therefore, the restrictions on normal schools also have to be relaxed. (2) The lives of the people in the United States and Britain have a special British and American style, which covers and drives them, making them a national characteristic, which is sufficient to unify their national consciousness. Therefore, they are happy to let teacher education be free. (3) The country is intoxicated with democratic thought for a long time, and it is not easy to implement overly coercive and rigid legal systems. Therefore, we firmly believe that any system is the product of its historical background and social environment. Otherwise, it will not grow up.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Finance - Bearish Sentiment Envelops Foreign Exchange Market - Exchange Rates for British and US Currencies Consistently Lengthen - Hong Kong Electronics, Qiao Zhifu, and Others Compete to Dump <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) opening with longer rates, with British currency at 25 points long, calculated at four shillings, and US currency at 4375, or six yuan sixty-eight seventy-five. Other currencies also uniformly lengthened. In the black market, British and US currencies initially opened slightly softer but later, due to the lingering negative sentiment from the previous day and the incessant dumping from Hong Kong electronics and four major speculators, coupled with heavy sales by Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and non-professional Datong Merchant, despite some buying by foreign firms such as Hua Bi, Ander, Holland, and Chinese banks, the position remained several times oversupplied. Consequently, the market weakened considerably. By noon, British gold had hardened to four shillings six two five, and US currency to seven yuan seventy-five. In the afternoon, Sassoon and Jewish merchants resumed selling, causing the market to continue to harden to four shillings six eight seventy-five for British gold and seven yuan eighty-four thirty-seven five for US currency. The day closed at four shillings six eight seventy-five and seven yuan eighty-one twenty-five, respectively, with British currency longer by seven one eight seventy-five and US currency cheaper by two five compared to the previous day. Although Sha Hua and others absorbed some, there was a temporary softening, but demand could not overcome supply, so it was difficult to sustain. The trend for October initially showed a greater degree of looseness than spot, once seeing a squeeze, but then gradually separated, with the looseness similar to spot. Trading was brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sha Hua Once Came to Close Positions</p>
<p>The morning began with London’s large strip, near-term sharply down one point two five, far-term steeply down one point four three seven five, New York silver prices down one two five, London gold fixed, exchange rate British to US, to Shanghai, to France all flat, US to British down one two five, to Shanghai up one point, to France down half a point, Central’s posted rates as usual, banks morning opened spot selling prices, British gold four shillings half, US currency seven yuan five three one two five, compared to the previous close, British slightly tight zero one five six two five, US slightly soft zero three one two five, although Chinese money changers and others closed positions after opening, it was not affected as certain foreign firms were willing to supply. Money changers closed positions, buying US dollar bills from a certain bank at seven yuan two five and three one two five, followed by Chinese merchants closing positions, buying October British gold from a certain bank at four shillings five three one two five, and October US currency at seven yuan five six two five. Datong also sold October US currency at seven yuan five six two five to a foreign firm. As HSBC’s rates were revealed, British, US, and other currencies uniformly lengthened, and the white silver balancing tax was revealed to have plummeted by seven points. From then on, Hong Kong electronics and Chinese-Western speculators raced to sell, and Japanese banks and Jewish merchants also came to dump, although the scope was smaller, foreign banks and Chinese banks still had some appetite, but the position ultimately couldn’t match it, so the market weakened sharply. Hong Kong electronics Chinese merchants and foreign Datong certain banks successively sold spot US currency to Chinese banks and foreign firms from seven yuan five six two five, up to seven five, at the same time Hong Kong electronics, Sassoon Japanese banks and Qiao Zhifu and others dumped spot British gold to Chinese banks and foreign firms from four shillings five six two five, up to six two five. At around 10:10, Chinese merchant Sha Hua suddenly seized the opportunity to close positions, and the seller's willingness to supply weakened, so the situation temporarily softened, Sha Hua bought spot British gold from a foreign firm at four shillings five six two five, and spot US currency at seven yuan six two five. Later, foreign firms’ selling prices were asking four shillings five three one two five and seven yuan five nine three seven five. At around 11:00, Chinese-Western speculators’ selling intention resurfaced, so the situation again became loose and hard, Sassoon sold spot British gold to foreign firms at four shillings five nine three seven five and six two five, followed by a Chinese merchant also selling October US currency to a certain bank at seven yuan six eight seven five, and spot US currency at seven yuan seventy-five. Later, foreign firms also sold October US currency to a certain bank, competing, hardening to seven yuan eighty-one twenty-five. Extending to the noon close, banks spot selling prices, British gold four shillings six two five, US currency seven yuan seventy-five.</p>
<p>Position Ultimately Felt Oversupplied</p>
<p>After the market, Sassoon and Jewish merchants continued to dump, and foreign firms, having profited, also had a selling appetite, so the potential hardened further, Sassoon, Qiao Zhifu, and Youli and others dumped spot British gold to foreign firms at four shillings six two five and six eight seventy-five, followed by Qiao Zhifu selling spot US currency to a foreign firm at seven yuan seventy-five and eighty-one twenty-five. Later, US currency at its hardest had shouted past seven yuan eighty-four thirty-seven five. Extending to the late close, banks spot selling prices, British gold four shillings six eight seventy-five, US currency seven yuan eighty-one twenty-five, October British gold four shillings six two five, US currency seven yuan six eight seventy-five.

<p>Yesterday's cash cooked red black market situation, although the foreign exchange loosened quite severely, and certain gold shops profited by arbitrage, the gold price only fell by one ten yuan, so the settlement price was increasingly squeezed with foreign exchange. According to the evening close calculation, British gold was only three hundred and thirty-six yuan away, and US currency was only four hundred and fifty-seven yuan away, because certain gold shops and others would fiercely absorb whenever it was small (or passed to Hong Kong gangs, or passed to certain Chinese banks). The whole day generally first fell and then turned stable, after breaking the four thousand yuan barrier, it returned. The morning opened slightly down, at four thousand and thirty yuan, followed by certain money changers raising it, immediately reaching four thousand and fifty-five yuan, then, with the foreign exchange greatly loosening, a selling wind was temporarily stirred, silver building gangs and certain gold shops rushed to sell, and overseas Chinese merchant multi-head massively came out, so it fell to three thousand nine hundred and seventy-five yuan low.

At noon, the foreign exchange returned to loosening, and after noon it decreased to four thousand and fifteen yuan. The situation was slightly calmer after noon, although the foreign exchange was still loose, and certain gold shops continued to arbitrage (it was heard that it was switched to foreign exchange), but securities gangs and money changers still had good appetites, so it struggled between four thousand and five yuan and four thousand and thirty-some yuan, resulting in a close at four thousand and fifteen yuan, trading was still smooth, about one thousand six hundred-some taels, silver building ornaments gold ultimately posted down five yuan, customs gold and others still flat.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, increasingly unsupported, one side because the exchange market was loosening unabated, and various rumors in the market also sufficient to stimulate people's hearts, so selling pressure increased, British gold pound falling one yuan five jiao, US dollar bill falling four jiao, Hong Kong bill falling five fen, French franc bill small five li, Singapore bill falling one jiao, Annam bill and Robi bill each small five fen, Canadian bill low four jiao, Philippine bill falling two jiao, Japanese gold bill then rising six li, Korean bill still stood one yuan one jiao seven fen two li, remaining currencies were still stable.</p>

<p>Also, Public Industry Office reported that yesterday's stock market, continued to form firmly, transactions smooth, prices rising, International Rubber Adjustment Committee recently decided to raise the last quarter limit to five percent, and becoming seventy-five percent, currently the world’s reserves are approximately enough for four months of consumption (in the United States they are only enough for three months), at the same time the amount required for barter trade agreements is also extremely important to satisfy, so given the rubber having the potential suspicion of being in short supply, this resolution, naturally nobody came out against, a year ago the limit, was only forty-five percent, now the amount increases so much, the enhancement of the subsequent profit efficiency of each rubber planting company, is clearly self-evident, to the fact of what should cause the response, will self be seen from the high dividends issued by each company.</p>

<p>Yarn market turned towards the path of softening, probably because the foreign exchange black market loosened, at the same time the market sometimes had a kind of catching the wind and grasping the shadows talk especially made people’s hearts trance and unsettled, the market situation still entered the territory of being hesitant, probably all because of the general operators manufacturing snatching the hat transaction, as for the guest side they also folded their hands and do not move, Hong Kong gang was restrained by remittances activity, purchasing power greatly diminished, so for ten count coarse yarn they were slightly buying assembled spot, other groups were very few lively, the mainland Jiangzhe provinces, recently because the Japanese yarn price was expensive, changed purchasing Hua yarn more, but twenty count cones and coarse yarn were smooth. Also, the other day forty-two count five strand price had been reported one thousand and twenty yuan, this yarn price was afraid of not being correct, we are correcting it.</p>
<p>Another message said that Shanghai port foreign cotton transactions, were still called lively yesterday, the Pingguo’er selling price was one hundred and thirty-six yuan, West India one hundred and seventy-some yuan, US cotton transactions were very quiet, no transactions had been heard, for many days, because the United States starting ships for the Far East were rare, it was difficult to determine cargo holds, these days Tongzhou arrivals have been very many, yesterday more than three thousand bales from Tongzhou arrived in Shanghai, because of this the White Block selling price was difficult to turn firm, yesterday it was only sold for one hundred and sixty-seven yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, was weak from the morning, because there was a lack of buyers, the cotton price fell six or seven pounds of sound, then also because many sold, and many settled, the market situation could not turn firm, resulting in the closing price dropping six or seven pounds of sound compared to the above day, India yesterday stopped market, the forecast slightly rose more than one Lo Robi remainder compared to the above day, Egyptian cotton market was very handsome, yesterday it strongly rose more than seventy sound, Liverpool rose four shillings.</p>
<p>The current yarn morning opening, the market was not removed from a dispersing aura, actually owing to the lack of activity in current sales transactions, Guangdong gang thoughts were flat, some had transactions for coarse yarn, but the amounts were few, twenty counts yarn not only had no appetite, on the contrary they spat it out, from this situation the market was lacking in vigor, the opening call price was very high, but the number of eaters were few, Double Horse spot opening price was small one yuan, at seven hundred and seventy-three yuan, however the wharf warrant fell five yuan, for seven hundred and forty yuan, after a short while it was heard that the gold price was not strong, foreign exchange was lengthening, selling wind rose and declined eight and nine yuan, current Double Horse price was seven hundred and sixty-four yuan, the close slightly returned up, investigated that a half day of transactions had one thousand four hundred and forty-five bales, price range twenty count Double Horse falling six yuan, Heavenly Girl falling ten yuan, Double Globe falling nine yuan, today exports had sixty-five pieces transporting to Xiamen, forty pieces transporting to Hong Kong, we will list the amounts bought by each group listed on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton trade is increasingly developing, and Japanese factories are also actively purchasing. Transactions among fellow traders are even more bustling. Therefore, the foundation of cotton prices remains firm. The most common business in the market is still with Chinese cotton white bales. Japanese and Chinese also imported 1,000 bales of Tonghua cotton, priced at $164.50. Taikang imported 300 pieces of American cotton Lumite. Chinese factories Xinsheng and Rongfeng are eagerly purchasing, so the selling price continues to rise. 1,838 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived at the wharf, and 834 bales of Changyinsha cotton. The following is a list of current cotton sales:</p>
<h3 id="e53">Grains: Japonica and Indica Rice Prices Differ by More Than Double; Middle Class Switching to Indica Rice, Sales Gradually Increasing <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of Indica rice fell by 35 cents the day before yesterday, the price seems to be relatively low. Therefore, regardless of local or visiting merchants, there is a desire to purchase at a lower price. Yesterday, due to the scarcity of arrivals, only 3,120 bags of Su Kunfeng Jia rice arrived by train. People's confidence increased, and traders and brokers immediately raised prices. Therefore, the price of rice increased by 35 cents in the early market. However, recently, sales have declined, and there are still ample chips in the market. Taking advantage of this opportunity, those holding goods launched them, and the situation suddenly became weak. Prices fell back again. As a result, Japonica rice prices remained stable, without rising or falling. Special Changjing rice is still priced at $43-44, medium at $41, special Xijing rice at $42-43, medium at $41, Su Tong Kunjing rice at $41, new Jing rice at $38, Fengjing Baige rice at $40, new Yangjian rice initially called for $27, but actually opened at $26.50, followed by $15.50. Lujian also started at $26.50, followed by $25.50. Sichuanjian rice ranged from $25 to $24. Wuhu special Jian rice initially traded at $23.40, then only $23 and $22.50. Pojian rice was at $21.50 and $21. Jiangbei new Jian rice was at $22.80 to $22.50. Bianyuan rice remained unchanged at $34-35. The total market traded more than 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>In other news, after several days of decline, local demand has gradually increased. This is because the lowest price of Indica rice differs from the highest price of Japonica rice by more than double. It is not only welcomed by the poor but also many in the middle class are switching to Indica rice. Therefore, although there are many stocks, sales are gradually increasing. Yesterday, inquiries came from rural villages in the interior, and there were rumors that train shipments were detained by some party. The sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, and the market rebounded by 34 cents. The total market saw local households selling over 2,000 bags, and rural villages in the interior selling over 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Manufacturers Collecting Warehouse Rent, Reflow Flour Depressed <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the current flour factory prices remained largely unchanged. The reflow flour market has been depressed because the factories are urging the withdrawal of warehouse goods. Fuxin has twice notified customers that those who do not transfer out of the warehouse after the deadline will be charged a monthly storage fee of 50 cents per bag. Therefore, warehouse receipts have been greatly affected. Those holding goods are devaluing them. The initial price opened at $6.90 to $8.50, and there was a period of chaos in the middle, reaching a price of 67 cents. As a result, actual sales in local streets and by guest merchants have also shrunk. Total market turnover is estimated at 340,000 bags. Today, flour exports are 4,440 bags to Xiamen and 11,500 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, supplies from various places were still continuous, but sales were sluggish. Factory囤 purchasing was uniformly slack. There are also reports that American wheat telegraphs have also weakened. The market has invisibly loosened by 45 points. It is estimated that the Fuxin and Fufeng factories jointly purchased over 3,000 bags of wheat from Su, Xi, Wu, and Song, and scattered stockpiles purchased one cart of Chuzhou wheat, the highest price being $9.90, followed by 5.2 cents. Today, 40 bags of wheat are being shipped to Xiamen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the increase in foreign exchange rates, the trend of foreign sugar weakened again. The Association’s price for spot goods of No. 24 crude white sugar in local warehouses fell by $1.50 to $54, while those in foreign warehouses fell by $1 to $1.30 to $53.80 to $3.50.

<p>The price of white coal dust and other goods has also fallen recently due to excessive arrivals and sluggish sales. Yesterday, a certain company offered Hongji white coal dust to briquette factories at only $66 per ton, which is $2 less than the previous week. However, people's confidence is weak and they dare not buy speculatively, only purchasing as needed. Therefore, transactions are few. Other types of dust, such as Guba dust, are still being held and sold at $66.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Imports and Exports: Large Quantities of Goods Shipped to South China, Foreign Goods Also Arriving <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>

<h3 id="e58">Market Conditions Compilation <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Silver Plummeting, American Indian Peace. A London telegram dated the 2nd states that speculators in the silver market sold off, lacking support, and the market fell. After the market closed, it stabilized. Those who quoted the listed price are watching. Spot silver fell sharply by 1.25 pence, and forward silver fell severely by 1.4375 pence. A New York silver telegram states that spot silver fell by 0.125. A Bombay silver telegram states that the Indian silver market is calm, and spot prices have slightly decreased by one anna.</p>
<p>Discount Rate Continues to Drop Slightly by $5: Yesterday, the discount rate for draft notes was initially quoted at $75 per thousand, then gradually decreased. By the afternoon closing, it was $70, which is slightly less than the previous day by $5. The interbank loan interest rate of the Money Trade Association was still quoted at 20 cents in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<p>Worries about the Interruption of Woolen Imports: Both retail and wholesale woolen transactions are good. Prices on main roads are brisk, both officially and unofficially. The European War is unlikely to end in the short term. Woolen imports rely solely on Italy for shipments to Shanghai. However, the shipping company suddenly received a telegram from the factory stating that those who wish to order must settle the value of the goods in foreign currency and remit the funds in advance. The factory will not be responsible for any unexpected risks encountered during shipment, and high-priced war insurance must be guaranteed. As a result, most operators are at a loss.</p>
<p>Tin Plummeting Uncontrollably: The sales of spot tin, which have been weak for a long time, have been largely to the Shaoxing region. The production and sales of tin foil in that area are nationwide. Since the disruption of transportation, the tin foil market has been depressed, and the amount of Xiaohong tin has also decreased. Another sales outlet is Hong Kong. The current market conditions in Hong Kong are poor. After the outbreak of the European War, transportation has been difficult, resulting in a slump in the market. Prices have plummeted. For example, Xiaohong tin was initially quoted at $830, then fell to $650, and recently the quoted price is only around $580. Dutch tin has similarly fallen from $880 to $700. However, yesterday's market standard was only $650.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Negotiation on Road Construction Beyond Boundaries, British Side Still Fighting Reasonably, Many Difficulties, Negotiations Stalled, Fake Police Publicly Drilling in Formation on Roads <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press briefing that Mr. Phillips, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the puppet Mayor Chuan Xiaonan are negotiating on the issue of taxes and road construction beyond boundaries. However, according to reports obtained yesterday, Mr. Phillips has denied this statement, saying that he is not currently continuing discussions with the puppet "Mayor." It has also been learned from reliable sources that the Shanghai Municipal Council, the British Defense Forces, the Japanese side, and the puppet "Municipal Government" recently held discussions on the issue of police power for road construction beyond boundaries. However, as of yesterday, the situation has stalled. The reason for this is still unknown. However, it is heard that the British military authorities are unwilling to concede on major points of contention and are still fighting reasonably, which is a major reason.</p>
<p>Road Construction Beyond Boundaries, Increasing Number of Fake Police</p>
<p>The area of road construction beyond boundaries, from Jing'an Temple in the east to Caojiadu in the west, and Xujiahui in the south, these triangular areas, are almost entirely controlled by fake police. In recent days, detective patrols from the police station, except for some important locations where posts are still stationed, although patrol teams patrol the roads, they no longer conduct inspections of passing pedestrians and vehicles. The number of fake police is increasing daily. Patrol teams, either by car or on foot, are constantly coming and going all day long. Their arrogance is extreme.</p>
<p>Two Teams of Fake Police Drilled in the Middle of the Road</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao stated that two teams of Dadao police, each with 40 members, drilled in Yuyuan Road between Difeng Road and Yidingpan Road this afternoon (the 3rd), forcing pedestrians and vehicles to pass through in a single line. Another team of 150 Dadao police drilled in front of the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade, and 60 were stationed at the intersection of Yidingpan Road. Each team was commanded by a Japanese military officer with a saber, but no Public Concession police were seen.</p>
<p>Rumors Abound, People Uneasy</p>
<p>In the western part of Shanghai, due to the strange actions of the Japanese and puppet forces in recent days, rumors have been rampant, and residents are panicked. The trend of relocation is at its peak. Landlords who usually rely on rent for a living are all complaining bitterly. In order to stabilize people's hearts, a certain party secretly sent people to tear off the rental notices at the entrances of alleys and on utility poles. However, yesterday, those moving eastward from Jing'an Temple were still constantly moving.</p>

<p>The National Day Commemorative Festival on October 10th is approaching in the blink of an eye. The Central Government, considering the extraordinary times, has issued an order to the whole country not to hold extravagant celebrations. In addition to raising flags to celebrate on this day, all sectors of the city will expand the winter clothing collection campaign. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Raising Flags to Commemorate, No Extravagant Celebrations</p>
<p>All sectors of the city will not hold extravagant celebrations or any commemorative ceremonies for the National Day Commemorative Festival, in accordance with the order. However, in order to commemorate the great achievements of the revolutionary martyrs in creating China, it has been decided that all sectors of the city will raise flags for one day in accordance with the arrangements agreed upon by the various groups and the authorities of the two concessions to celebrate. On Avenue Edward VII and Fada Avenue, flag shops have been rushing to produce large quantities of national flags of various sizes in recent days to meet the needs of all sectors. It is expected that the whole city will be filled with a warm and solemn atmosphere at that time.</p>
<p>Expanding Collection, Winter Clothing Campaign</p>
<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Central Relief Committee, proposed to expand the disaster relief campaign and raise funds to provide relief to disaster victims in various places during this year's Double Tenth Festival. At the same time, the National Winter Clothing Collection Campaign Committee also decided to lead local branches and charitable organizations to expand the collection of 3 million pieces of winter clothing on the Double Tenth Festival. All sectors of the city have responded unanimously to this and are currently holding separate meetings to promote the campaign. It has been decided to raise $200,000 in lieu of winter clothing to be submitted to various national banks for collection and transshipment to the front-line soldiers to provide comfort. At the same time, various industries have decided to continue to pledge donations to refugees for another year so that refugees in Shanghai can be spared the risk of freezing and starvation.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Japanese Consul Suddenly Issued a Notice Yesterday, Announcing the Blockade of Aojiang, Implementing Military Operations Against Gu'aotou, Instructing Third-Country Ships to Sail Out of the Sea <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side announced last month that it would blockade three ports in the Wenzhou waterway. Yesterday, the Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, Miura, issued a notice in the name of the consulate to diplomatic officials and customs officials of various countries in China, stating that it would blockade Gu'aotou in that area. The content can be divided into three points: (1) The Japanese Navy will conduct military operations against Gu'aotou, 30 nautical miles south of Wenzhou, on October 6th at 8:00 AM (Japanese time). Military warships and vessels of third countries anchored in the port are requested to sail out of the sea before that time. The Japanese military will, out of necessity for military operations, block the port with obstacles and dangerous objects after that time, so that it cannot be passed. The Japanese side will not be responsible for any losses suffered by ships and vessels that do not sail out before that time. (2) The location of the obstacles and dangerous objects is one penny north and south of passing Pipashan. (3) The vicinity of Gu'aotou will become a combat zone. It is hoped that third-country people living in that area will leave as soon as possible. It is also learned that this decision to blockade the various ports of Wenzhou announced by the Japanese side is the third decision.</p>
<p>Obstructing Foreign Exports, Implementing Bombing</p>
<p>Aojiang is in the south of Oujiang in Wenzhou, eastern Zhejiang, about 30 kilometers from Oujiang. Gu'aotou is an important port at the mouth of Aojiang. Since Aojiang was ordered to be blockaded by the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander, all ships have been anchored at Gu'aotou and have stopped sailing in. After the voyage from Wenzhou was blocked by the Japanese and suspended, foreign shipping companies changed their routes. On the morning of the 26th of last month, Gu'ao was bombed by Japanese aircraft. As a result, the British Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing ship sailed back to Shanghai to avoid danger. The purpose of the Japanese aircraft bombing was to obstruct the passage of merchant ships of various countries.</p>
<p>Shenyou Left Aojiang, Shenfu Sailed to</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the British Jardine Matheson Company yesterday and learned that the last foreign ship to leave Gu'aotou was the company's Shenyou ship, which left yesterday and returned to Shanghai. The company's Shenfu ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Fujian on the morning of the 5th.</p>
<p>Impossible to Invade Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>It was also learned from the shipping industry that Aojiang has long been blockaded by the Chinese military authorities, and heavy troops are stationed there, with a very solid defense. The Japanese military's announcement to invade Gu'aotou is aimed at blockading Aojiang and obstructing the passage of merchant ships of various countries. However, according to the observation of general shipping merchants, the Japanese military's announcement of invasion is purely intimidation. It is not easy to invade eastern Zhejiang from Aojiang.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Situation in Zone A of Suzhou Creek North is Still Peaceful, Japanese Posts on North Jiangxi Road Shifted West, British Defenses Reinforced with Wire Mesh, No Need for Injections for Those Not Going to Hongkou <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The wooden frame and barbed wire erected by the Japanese military on Jiangxi Road bridgehead to Bazilu area has two gaps, one at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, and one at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Wenjiansi Road, for residents of Hongkou to enter and exit. The Japanese posts were set up east of the barbed wire to check the passes of passing pedestrians. However, when the reporter went to inspect the area at 4:00 PM yesterday, he saw that the Japanese post at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Wenjiansi Road had been moved to the west side of the barbed wire to check the passes of passing pedestrians. The general residents were very alarmed by this, fearing that if they moved further west, the area that the Japanese called the new defense area (Zone A between North Henan Road and North Jiangxi Road) would be no different from being in a special zone. However, the Japanese military at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road still stood east of the barbed wire.</p>

<p>In view of the urgent military needs elsewhere, the British naval authorities decided earlier to withdraw five of the ten British gunboats stationed in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River (east of Hankou). The names of the ships are Grasshopper, Dragonfly, Ladybug, Aphid, and Gold Bug. Of these five ships, only the Gold Bug is stationed in the Yangtze River. The other four ships are docked in the Huangpu River. According to reliable sources from the Dachung News Agency, after receiving the order to withdraw, the Grasshopper and Dragonfly, which were stationed in the Huangpu River, left Shanghai yesterday. The other three ships are making various preparations and will also withdraw within a few days. The destination of the withdrawal is Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>

<p>English Army, Conscientious Defense</p>
<p>Since the change of defense in Zone A of Suzhou Creek North, the area west of North Henan Road has been designated as a British defense area. The Money Trade Association in that area originally had a British lookout post, which was guarded by Scottish soldiers in shifts. Yesterday afternoon, the number of British troops in the Money Trade Association suddenly increased to five or six, and the front of the lookout post was re-wrapped with barbed wire, prohibiting pedestrians from walking inside. The post is very close to the Japanese guard post on Haining Road, forming a confrontational situation.</p>
<p>No Need for Injections for Those Not Going to Hongkou</p>
<p>Since the British defense area in the concession north of Suzhou Creek and east of Henan Road was transferred to the Japanese defense area, the puppet Social Affairs Bureau had information on implementing epidemic prevention injections for residents in that defense area. Yesterday, it was learned that regarding epidemic prevention injections, new regulations have now been made: residents living in the defense area who do not enter the Hongkou area can be exempted from injections. Therefore, the statement that everyone in the defense area must be injected, which has been widely circulated by residents in the defense area in recent days, has been changed. However, if residents of the defense area need to enter Hongkou, they must still be injected. It is reported that the hospital currently responsible for this injection is Zhabei Luren Hospital, and the number of people being injected is extremely small.</p>
<p>No Significant Changes in the Area</p>
<p>Apart from the Japanese side stationing a sentry at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road and erecting boundary markers on the various roads on North Henan Road, there are no significant changes in the area. However, it is generally speculated that the Japanese side will gradually impose restrictions after the injection work is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Preventing Legal Tender from Escaping to Shanghai; Strict Review; Amounts Over 100,000 Yuan Must Be Submitted to the Ministry; No Need for a Management Committee in Shanghai <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent the outflow of legal tender from the interior and encourage the inflow of funds into the interior, the Ministry of Finance ordered the four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, to establish a Domestic Exchange Management Committee. The general office of the committee is located in Chongqing.  Branches of the Domestic Exchange Management Committee are established in all important cities nationwide where the four banks have joint offices. It is stipulated that remittances for the purchase of daily necessities must be approved by the committee. Applications for amounts under 100,000 yuan are reviewed and processed by the committee; those exceeding 100,000 yuan are forwarded by the committee to the Ministry of Finance for approval. Since the implementation, remittances from the interior to Shanghai have become more stringent. Without approval from the committee, remittances cannot be entrusted to banks, firms, or post offices. Particular attention is paid to remittances from the interior to Shanghai.  As Shanghai is an occupied area, and there are no restrictions on the amount of funds remitted from Shanghai to the interior, and to encourage the inflow of funds, remittances from Shanghai to the interior are particularly welcome.  Therefore, under the current circumstances, there is no need to establish an exchange management committee in Shanghai.  Shanghai banks are allowed to waive remittance fees for remittances to the interior and may pay in Shanghai's common exchange, with the aim of promoting the movement of floating capital into the interior.</p>

<p>Many prominent French residents in Shanghai, under the auspices of Mrs. Cosme, wife of the French Ambassador, have recently established an "Ambulance Donation Committee" modeled after the original methods of France and other countries. The committee prepares to solicit donations from French residents and French friends throughout the city in order to purchase an ambulance, to be named "Shanghai Ambulance," to be presented to the French government. The total cost is 250,000 French francs. It is expected that French residents and French friends will donate enthusiastically, and it will not be difficult to accomplish this charitable act in the shortest possible time.

<p>The Ministry of Finance maintains its creditworthiness and never changes. The principal and interest due are allocated to the Central Bank of China on schedule and deposited into the National Debt Fund Management Committee account for repayment of principal and interest. The consolidated rehabilitation gold and long three debts guaranteed by customs duties are also discounted by the four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and paid as usual. Therefore, the Shanghai stock grey market has always been stable. Government bonds issued and managed by the Central Government after the War of Resistance include: (1) The 26th Year of the Republic of China National Salvation Bonds for 500 million yuan; (2) The 27th Year of the Republic of China National Defense Bonds for 500 million yuan; (3) The 27th Year of the Republic of China Gold Bonds for 100 million yuan in Customs Gold Units, 10 million pounds sterling, and 50 million US dollars; (4) The 28th Year of the Republic of China Construction Bonds for 600 million yuan; (5) The 28th Year of the Republic of China Military Supply Bonds for 600 million yuan; (6) The Relief Bonds for 30 million yuan.

Except for the National Salvation Bonds, which are subscribed to by the people, the US dollar, pound sterling, and Customs Gold Unit bonds are solicited from overseas Chinese. The National Defense, Relief, Military Supply, and Construction Bonds are underwritten by various banks. Moreover, since the War of Resistance, very little has been used, and most of it has been properly stored. Therefore, there is absolutely no need to worry about war expenses in the future.</p>

<p>Bada Silk Factory</p>
<p>About 200 workers from the first, second, and third factories of the Bada Silk Factory on North Henan Road in this city are known for their high-quality silk products that sell well in various ports in Southeast Asia, forming a unique prosperous situation among the withered silk factories after the war. Recently, it was heard that the method of equal warp and weft has aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers. All the workers are feeling the increase in the cost of living in Shanghai, but the capitalists are using it as an excuse to deduct wages, making it difficult to maintain a living, resulting in a joint strike by the workers of the three factories, who put forward the following conditions to the capitalists: (1) During the period of equal warp and weft, the capitalists shall provide each person with 5 jiao of living expenses per day; (2) During the period of stoppage of work for pattern modification, the capitalists shall subsidize food expenses; (3) Maintain the 11:30 working hours. The labor dispute has been deadlocked for half a month, and the capitalists have not yet come forward to negotiate. Yesterday, a certain officer from the police station came forward to mediate, but the capitalists did not appoint official representatives.</p>
<p>Qingong Silk Factory</p>
<p>All 270 workers of the Qingong Silk Factory on Xiaoshadu Road, due to the high cost of living, were forced to request the factory authorities to guarantee their livelihood and provide relief measures. It is learned that the conditions put forward by the workers are as follows: (1) Restore the 11:30 working hours. If it cannot be restored, then subsidize 3 jiao of living expenses per day; (2) The factory shall plan for food and accommodation; (3) Those who cannot maintain their work and life shall be given 30 yuan by the factory as travel expenses to return to their hometown.

<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the Chinese army previously used 75 to 100 ships of various types, fully loaded with cement, and sank them in the Yangtze River near Jiangyin to form a water barrier to prevent the Japanese navy from invading. Among them was an old river steamer. Recently, the Japanese navy floated it from the bottom of the river and towed it to Shanghai with a tugboat. Yesterday (the 2nd), it was moored near Zhoujiazui. Soon, it will be towed to the Jiangnan Shipyard for demolition and melting, it is said to manufacture munitions or steel plates. It is heard that the ship is one of the old ships of the Sanbei Company. The ship's hull shows signs of having been burned and is mottled with rust and covered with mud.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Attempting to Control Tianjin-Tanggu Freight; Instigating a Barge Strike; Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Tanggu Barge Transportation Stopped; Shanghai Tianjin Merchants Dare Not Ship Goods <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Since the great flood in Tianjin, there has been an extreme shortage of food. In the past month, a large amount of flour and miscellaneous grains have been transported from this city to provide relief. Most of these goods are carried by Japanese ships, and the rest are shipped by the ships of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and Butterfield &amp; Swire. However, the warehouses of Butterfield &amp; Swire in Tanggu are narrow and must be barged to Tianjin, which is more troublesome. Therefore, most merchants load onto Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. However, Butterfield &amp; Swire has more barges between Tianjin and Tanggu, and barge transportation is slightly more convenient. After the Yantai barge strike last month, it was instigated by a certain party and then mediated by a certain party. Although it has been resolved, the barge transportation industry has already been managed by it. Now, it is heard that the barges of Butterfield &amp; Swire in Tanggu have also been instigated by a certain party to strike, demanding increased wages. It has been going on for many days and has not yet been resolved. Therefore, the Haikou ship of the company going to Tianjin today, except for 10% of the goods originally shipped from Hong Kong, the Tianjin merchants in this street dare not load their goods, and the ship sails to Tianjin empty, fearing that the barge transportation industry there will also suffer the same fate as Yantai in the future and be controlled by it.</p>
<p>Tianjin Flood Recedes; Outward Shipping Resumes</p>
<p>Since late August, Tianjin suddenly experienced a flash flood, with the Hai River estuary and both banks flooded. Navigation was indistinguishable, and targets were lost. The water at the Zizhu Forest Wharf in the British Concession reached over ten feet, making it difficult for ships to navigate and impossible to dock and unload. All ships operating on the line, such as Xin'an Na, Xin'an Fu, Xin'an Sui, Taishun, and Xinxiang Tai, were temporarily suspended. Northern Ocean liners such as Shengjing, Shuntian, Dingsheng, Yunnan, and Fusheng were also suspended from Tianjin and only operated to Yantai, Qingdao, and Weihaiwei. According to the Daguan News Agency reporter's inquiry to the shipping industry, the flood in Tianjin has gradually receded since the 20th of last month and has now completely receded. Therefore, most ships have resumed shipping one after another. The British merchant Liji ship (managed by Qiacheng Company), Butterfield &amp; Swire's Xin Beijing ship, and Moller &amp; Co.'s Kaisiten Moller ship sailed to Tianjin on the 2nd. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Dingsheng ship and Butterfield &amp; Swire's Shuntian ship both sailed to Tianjin yesterday. The ship setting sail today is Butterfield &amp; Swire's Haikou ship.</p>
<p>Baihe River Silting; Passengers and Goods are Transferred</p>
<p>According to a Daguan News Agency reporter's inquiry, although the outer ships on the Shanghai-Tianjin line have resumed shipping, the Baihe River has not been dredged and is silted up, and the waterway is extremely shallow, only reaching about ten feet. Therefore, larger ships are still unable to sail to Tianjin. The ships of Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. are equipped with barges, and passengers and goods are transferred at the Tanggu estuary. Other ships go directly to the Zizhu Forest Wharf. All ships, except for Xin'an Na, which has joined the Ningbo route, such as Xin'an Fu and Ansui Taishun, have not yet resumed shipping because the waterway is silted up and they cannot enter the port. The British merchant Xinxiang Tai ship originally intended to sail to Tianjin after the trial voyage to Aojiang was blocked and returned, but it has not been successful. It is now scheduled to sail to Ningbo tomorrow.</p>

<p>The entire food problem in Shanghai has been around for several months. The selling prices of various goods have been handled by organizations managing tribute rice at leveled prices, and the concession authorities have also repeatedly decided to find ways to suppress rice prices, in order to reduce the burden on citizens. It is heard that rice-producing areas such as Wuhu, Changshu, Wuxi, Changzhou, Danyang, Suzhou, Kunshan, etc., have all reported a bumper harvest of late rice and have already entered the market. Rice merchants from various gangs have been dredged, but the so-called "transportation certificate" has not yet been settled. Once the negotiation is completed, a large amount of domestic rice can be transported to Shanghai for sale. Currently, the domestic rice transported to Shanghai is from various cities and counties along the Sujia Railway and various places in Nangang. 4,000 to 5,000 bags arrive daily, which is enough for daily sales. Therefore, rice prices will fall.</p>
<p>Rice Trade Association</p>
<p>The temporary market trading rules of the tea market have been revised and passed by the joint meeting of representatives of the seven rice trade associations on the 2nd of this month. In addition to attending the joint meeting and contributing opinions, the members of the market management committee also separately convened representatives of the market, customer, and shop parties yesterday morning to report on the revision of the "Market Trading Rules" by the rice trade association joint meeting and advised that future transactions must be conducted in accordance with these rules, and that both buyers and sellers must conduct spot transactions. Empty sales and empty purchases are not allowed, in order to adjust the people's food.</p>
<p>May Not Go Off Track</p>
<p>Transactions. All intermediary operations, sales of consignment goods, or purchases of rice by rice shops must be traded in the market. The representatives all expressed their agreement to these rules. Therefore, future operations in the market will gradually become standardized, and all dark transactions will be reduced. The members of the market mediation committee are organized by an equal number of people from the market, customer, and shop parties to handle market disputes. The market management committee will hold regular meetings to discuss and propose.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday regarding the remittance of domestic goods shipped to Shanghai, stating: "To the honorable Ministers of Military Celebration, Finance, and Economic Affairs, we recently saw in the newspaper that all goods shipped from Zhejiang Customs to Shanghai for domestic sales, regardless of type, must be remitted. The high price of goods in Shanghai has broken historical records. In this situation, it is tantamount to pricing domestic goods as foreign goods, which hinders commercial sales and increases public hardship. We should request that your ministries provide instructions on the reasons for this remittance decision, so that all industries can jointly appeal for exemption. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>

(2) Bank of China banknotes, except for the six items such as Hanxiang, and Bank of Communications banknotes, except for place names in Guandong, will still be handled according to the old case due to special circumstances. The rest are used regardless of place name. (3) Bank of China Farmers Bank banknotes can also be used regardless of the province of issuance. (4) Banknotes of China Agricultural and Industrial, China Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Agricultural and Commercial, Zhongnan, Siming, Tongshang, and Kenye banks can also be used. (5) Legal tender with guerrilla area place names is used as usual. Tianjin-Shandong-Hankou banknotes issued by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are also exchanged as usual. Shanghai only allows payment of immediate drafts payable in the place of issuance or Chongqing, in order to prevent the Japanese and puppets from privately transferring funds, but they can be remitted to the interior for the purchase of domestic goods.</p>

This unprecedented incident occurred within minutes of the Asama Maru leaving the Huishan Wharf. At that time, customs inspectors boarded the ship and asked the captain to stop for a moment, then entered Mrs. Almeida's cabin, saying that they wanted to inspect her luggage. It is said that the inspectors acted rudely and eventually carried out Mrs. Almeida's luggage, saying that it was not "stated that there was such luggage."

Taking advantage of an opportunity, he lured Wu's seven-year-old daughter, Zhenxian, away. He housed her at the residence of a woman named Liu Yu at No. 2, Lane 66, Huangpu Beach Road in the French Concession, intending to sell her to other provinces for profit. To observe Wu Nanshan's reaction, he went to Wu's house the next morning to inquire about news. Wu, indeed, did not suspect that his daughter Zhenxian had been abducted by him. Wu told Hang the situation and gave him one French dollar to help find her. On the morning of the 20th, at 8:00 AM, Hang met Wu Nanshan at the Dongxing Teahouse on Gordon Road and said, "Your daughter Zhenxian has been found, and can be located within three days. However, you must offer a reward of several tens of dollars to achieve this." Upon hearing this, Wu Nanshan realized that his daughter Zhenxian had been lured away by Hang, hidden somewhere, with the intention of extorting money for her return. He immediately turned Hang over to the patrolling police, who took him to the Putuo Road Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court.

<h3 id="e103">First Day at Work: At a Small Wooden Toy Factory <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>With a strange excitement, she resolutely and reluctantly left her not-yet-awake home. The morning air still carried a misty chill. It was the first time she had walked on the road so early by herself, and it was a novel interest for her. There were very few people on the road, it was still very early. She knew, but did not slow down. She thought: The first day should always be early, and if she arrived alone first, it would be more natural to greet the others as they arrived one by one, than to arrive late and greet groups of people. So, unconsciously, she walked even faster.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the alley, a pungent smell of acetone stabbed into her nostrils. She quickly covered her nose with a handkerchief. Hesitantly, she walked into the lane. The tall, rigid door was solemnly closed. She reached out and knocked on the door knocker a few times, but there was no sound inside. After a pause, she discovered that the door was not tightly closed, leaving a crack. She gently pushed it open and walked in.</p>
<p>Walking into the factory, a faint smell of acetone greeted her. Several rough wooden tables were arranged horizontally and vertically, and the machines were all silent. The floor, swept by a broom, still had faint traces of sawdust. She sat down in her place.</p>
<p>Lazy footsteps echoed on the stairs. She guessed that it might be the foreman or the manager, who should have gotten up early to inspect the machines... But what first appeared in the doorway was a broom and dustpan, followed by a slovenly, listless boy. Confused, she greeted him. The boy was also startled, and silently carried the dustpan and broom inside.</p>
<p>The workers arrived in twos and threes, and the factory quickly became lively. When the clock struck seven, the motor started, and the male workers all stood by the machines. She put on her newly made apron, feeling a strand of inexplicable joy.</p>
<p>The sawing machine raised bursts of sawdust like dust, mixed with a thick smell of acetone, forming a turbid atmosphere. Several male workers were wearing masks, but most were not. None of the female workers were. The strong smell of acetone made her throat dry and her hair and body were covered in sawdust. Looking at the others, they seemed as if nothing was happening, their laughter competing with the sound of the machines. She tried her best to endure: "You won't be afraid once you get used to it."</p>
<p>"Why don't you all wear masks too?" She felt that there wasn't a healthy person in this group, although their spirits were quite lively.</p>
<p>"Not used to wearing them! It feels stuffy and uncomfortable in our noses!" The female worker next to her, who was chatting enthusiastically with others, answered her. Her eyebrows were also covered in wood powder.</p>
<p>In the polishing section behind, twenty or so pairs of hands held sandpaper, rubbing the edges of rough wooden pieces, spreading a roomful of air harmful to the human body. However, the workers, as if their senses were numb, just lowered their heads and did their work. She couldn't help but feel both pity and admiration. She wanted to say: Health is also important!</p>
<p>"What time do you work until at night?" After a while, she asked again.</p>
<p>"Nine thirty."</p>
<p>"That's so late!"</p>
<p>"The male workers don't get off until ten thirty."</p>
<p>"Is the pay better?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. Their salary is lower than ours. They're not called workers, they're just considered apprentices, so their work is harder than most, and their salary is discounted!"</p>
<p>"Ah! —"</p>
<p>She couldn't help but feel deeply sorry for them, and a wave of pity swept over her.</p>
<p>Lunchtime was an hour. Except for a few who went home, the rest ate their lunch and then went to the sawing section to chat with the male workers. Only she stayed in the priming area, quietly eating her bread. Taking advantage of the space, she went to see the glazing, drilling, and nailing departments... Everywhere was quiet, and the rising dust seemed intermittent.</p>
<p>She picked up a nearly finished movable elephant. Its trunk swung back and forth. She stretched out her finger and gently tapped it:</p>
<p>"Who knows how much energy and health has been consumed for such a small toy!" (Su Mo)</p>
<h3 id="e104">200,000 Yuan for Winter Clothing <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>The cycle of seasons has brought us to late autumn once more. The piercing cold air has already begun to assault the earth, and its power intensifies with time. We are fortunate to be able to hide in our houses, already shivering from the cold. But the soldiers who fight for us, for the free survival of our children and grandchildren, battling in the fields, leaping through the mountains, surging through the rivers—the threat of that cold air is a thousand times more severe for them than it is for us. As this harsh winter approaches, how can we remain indifferent as we tailor our own winter clothes? I believe everyone is willing to donate voluntarily, isn't that right?</p>
<p>This year, the National Winter Clothing Collection Committee has stipulated that each special region must raise money for winter clothing, and Shanghai is only responsible for 200,000 yuan. Assuming there are four million people in the greater Shanghai area, then each person's contribution to the soldiers' winter needs is only five cents! In reality, it doesn't take any effort at all. Although there are many poor people, perhaps poor people will donate money for winter clothing more readily than the wealthy. Therefore, we hope to start a competition to donate money for winter clothing, expanding the amount as much as possible. The more, the better.</p>
<p>Winter clothing, while serving to keep out the cold, also represents a close connection and sincere encouragement between the military and the people. Particularly for those of us in special regions, it expresses our fervent hopes and concerns. At the same time, the soldiers will surely be more moved, encouraged, and motivated by the winter clothing presented by the special regions than by that presented by the people in the rear.</p>
<p>From our perspective, those of us living in Shanghai are like being in a train that has come uncoupled, losing the power to move forward, suffering unspeakable pain in our lives. To take the most obvious example, the control and manipulation of daily necessities, the difficulty of transportation, has led to soaring prices, making it difficult to sustain life. Wives are cold and children are hungry. What are the factors behind this? This is an example of "the nation comes before the family." Therefore, we cannot simply lament the high cost of living, or crane our necks and wait for prices to fall. We must use our strength to remove the pressure that is being placed on us. In the past, there were some people who lacked awareness, acting as if it was none of their business, believing that they could stay out of it in the concessions, enjoying themselves, acting recklessly, and not striving for progress. Now, there is the fact of correction for this error in realization. As President Chiang has said: "There is no distinction between north and south, no distinction between old and young... Resistance is the responsibility of every Chinese person... Everyone must do what they can, contributing money if they have money, contributing strength if they have strength."</p>
<p>Shanghai's contribution of 200,000 yuan for winter clothing is only a little better than being unable to do anything at all. Strictly speaking, it doesn't count as "contributing money if you have money, contributing strength if you have strength." People of Shanghai, be enthusiastic! The future rewards will be ten thousand times higher than the cost of winter clothing!</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Planning to Establish a Medical School and Creating Talented Scholars; Thinking About Expanding Village Governance and Establishing Daycare</p>
<p>After they had decided on the day to go to Shanghai, on Saturday afternoon, Wu Junsu waited for them in the dormitory, specially for their arrival. This time, there were indeed many people attending Jin Danyu's wedding banquet, because her social circle was wide, and she treated people kindly on weekdays. Even Lin Jiancheng didn't have as many people on his side as she did. Some people said: This time, the wedding gifts they received from people must be considerable. In reality, there weren't many, because this trend has changed greatly after the war compared to before the war. Before the war, for all social weddings, funerals, and celebrations, gifts were given: the gifts given were often impractical. For example, when people had happy events, they would often send a large red silk banner, with four golden characters, which was truly useless. Many families, because they knew two wealthy people, would hang up the banners given by the wealthy people, thinking that they had dealings with wealthy people. There were even cases where wealthy people had not sent banners, and people forged the wealthy people's signatures. After the war, these vanities and pretenses were broken. Moreover, those banners were originally made of flannel or satin, which could be repurposed to make clothes or quilt covers. Later, they became the worst kind of rayon, which had no other use besides making banners. And what about sending silver shields and silverware? They were all copper plates, coated with some silver. Inlaid with redwood bases and fitted with glass frames, they seemed somewhat artistic, but were actually vulgar and unsightly. These things were even more useless, because banners, with a changed signature, could be transferred to other people; those silver shields and the like, engraved with your name, as well as their own name, could not be transferred to other people. Keeping them was useless, discarding them was a pity, and piling them up took up space in the house. Those things, when made, were worth seven or eight dollars, but if you sold them to a junk collector, he wouldn't even want them for two or three jiao. At that time, the most straightforward gifts were naturally cash. But many people often couldn't even provide for themselves, but for the sake of face, they insisted on giving gifts. There were even some official circles where, whether it was an old lady's birthday or a young master's wedding or a young lady's wedding, gifts were openly collected. Subordinates would openly collect shares to flatter their superiors. Among the gifts, there were also distinctions of class and rank, with levels such as fortune, prosperity, longevity, and joy. No matter if you were short of food and unable to cover your roof, these gifts to your superiors could not be skipped. This trend was not only in official circles, but also in some institutions, and even in the business world. It seemed as if you would lose face if you didn't give a gift. This was clearly open bribery, and the extent of the corruption was terrifying! (187)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Attempt to Quit Smoking <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Has every smoker made a vow to quit this habit more than once? I think so. But who can match their words with their actions, even for a relatively long period? In fact, every smoker knows that cigarettes are not as difficult to quit as other poisons, and no one will admit that smoking cigarettes is addictive. This can be proven by the fact that everyone has had more than one period of quitting. Yet, no one can sustain the fight. Among friends, we often hear vows to quit smoking. Some even make contracts, signing strict penalty clauses. The result is only a few days of forced abstinence. After one person breaks the contract, it is implicitly cancelled, leaving behind a permanent joke. I also had a friend who was hospitalized due to illness, and was therefore forced to quit cigarettes. He was proud of this, believing that this time he had achieved his goal of quitting. But less than a month after being discharged from the hospital, he resumed the habit, starting with "a cigarette after a meal." He even had his excuses, saying: This is due to the environment. In the hospital, doctors do not allow smoking, and there are no smokers in the same ward, so everyone did not smoke. But now, for social gatherings with friends or business dealings, cigarettes are the most common form of socializing, so one has to indulge a little. There is naturally some truth to this, the so-called "social cigarette."</p>
<p>Therefore, I have never advised people to quit smoking, nor have I vowed to quit myself. I only try to "smoke less" within the realm of possibility, that is, only socialize with "social cigarettes" when socializing is absolutely necessary. Now, I am trying "to quit smoking" for the first time. "Trying" naturally does not mean firmly quitting, but since success has always been in trying, if one's will is strong, this "trying" may be the initial success of "abstaining."</p>
<p>The so-called "trying to quit smoking" comes with the following conditions. First: "smoke less," for example, buy boxed cigarettes instead of canned ones as before. This way, you can check how many cigarettes you have smoked today at any time, and unconsciously reduce the opportunity to smoke. Second: People generally say that smoking is to relieve boredom, so in their spare time, buy some sweets, peanuts, etc. to replace cigarettes, to achieve the purpose of "smoking less."</p>
<p>Now the price of cigarettes has soared. Ordinary cigarettes that used to cost ten cents a box have risen to about twenty cents. The monthly consumption in this area has doubled. In these times of high prices, from the perspective of thrift, we should also reduce this unnecessary consumption. Let's try it out and test whether our will is strong or not?</p>

<h3 id="e107">Review of New Performers at Geng Xin Theatre <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>The Geng Xin Stage hired new performers who began performing on the evening of the 27th. During the day, an opening ceremony was held, with the four female dan performers Wu (Suqiu), Zhao (Jinrong), Liang (Yunqiu), and Li (Wanyun) cutting the ribbon. I personally attended the event. In the evening, the four female dan performers' joint performance of "Four Five Flower Caves" was something I didn't want to watch. The play "Five Flower Caves" is a double act of truth and falsehood, which is illogical. Moreover, doubling it again to make it four is even more ridiculous. I am already afraid of listening to the records of the four female dan performers and watching the movies of the four Pan Jinlians, let alone the four young female dan performers. On the third day, Wu Suqiu performed two plays, ("Baolian Deng," "Zhan Wancheng"). It is worth seeing both the Qingyi and Huadan roles. In addition, there are old male performers Chen Shaolin, old female performers Li Duokui, and painted-face performer Li Chunheng to watch, so I went. By the time I arrived, the "Jian Jiu Ling" had already been sung. In this play, the young male performer plays Zhu Xuhou Liu Zhang, singing the Erhuang Manban, which is extremely difficult to master. In the past, De Junru was skilled at it. I have never seen Zhou Weijun perform it, and I don't know how he sings it.</p>
<p>Li Duokui sang the Empress Dowager's farewell to the court. Duokui's voice is quite loud and clear, but the pronunciation is slightly lacking in clarity. In the Xipi Shouban of the Changting farewell scene, she sang loudly and vigorously, which is the skill of singing opera. Old and talented people are rare, so we have to let Duokui walk alone, and there is no need to compare her with Xie Baoyun and Gong Yunfu.</p>
<p>"Baolian Deng" has a scene of "making a scene in school." Chen Shaolin plays Liu Yanchang, and his singing is very disciplined, without any deviations from the tune. He can be called a sober person among a drunken crowd, which I admire the most. His voice is authentic and without any evilness. Although the sound is not loud, it can still be released. If he cultivates his energy and works hard, he can become very popular. His acting is vivid and has excellent points, such as when he says to his wife, "Speak after waking up... I will kneel." He deliberately pretends to be nonchalant to deceive his wife into swearing an oath. This part is the most appropriate. Among the few lines of dialogue, some words are low in voice and not clear. It is advisable to pay attention to correcting them.</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu plays Wang Guiying, using the new school to sing the Shouban. Her appearance is beautiful, and she is full of intelligence. Her movements are smooth. Singing new tunes is not annoying, and her pronunciation is generally accurate. However, the "Hua Fa Zhe" sounds like Shang Xiaoyun, dull and muffled, which must be changed. For example, the pronunciation of the word "da" is close to the ancient sound, starting with the sound of "duo," which is not suitable for female dan performers. Her acting and expression are very refined, mostly derived from intelligence. (If she were to act in shadow plays, she could overwhelm everything. It is a pity that this kind of talent is not found in movies.) A friend next to me said: "Suqiu sings well but her costume is not good." I smiled and said: "With such a beautiful face and crescent eyebrows, are you worried that no one will give her new costumes?"</p>
<p>In "Zhan Wancheng," Zhang Ji is played by Liang Huichao. Liang is young and his skills are fiery, which belongs to the southern school. Li Chunheng plays Cao Cao, imitating Hao Shoushen, adding double the humor to the old and spicy performance. It is a pity that his voice is not as good as before. Wu Suqiu plays Zou Shi, deeply understanding the plot, and fully performs it. Watching the two rats fighting and spying on Cao Man from the upstairs playing the qin, her posture is elegant, obtaining the secrets of Gou Huisheng. A woman with this kind of charm, coupled with a face that seems to be smiling but not smiling, who wouldn't want to watch her? Why wouldn't she be popular? Wu's Huadan plays are better than her Qingyi plays, because she is as gorgeous as peaches and plums, suitable for passion but not for coldness. Because it was already half-past eleven, I didn't watch "Ci Shen," and the scene "Ma Qian" already showed signs of being rushed.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Striving for the Masses <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Bingdu</p>
<p>After reading "The Future of Drama in Shanghai" - Dedicated to the Drama Workers of the "Isolated Island"</p>
<p>We cannot deny that in recent years, the "Green Treasure Theatre" has occupied a very superior position in the entertainment industry. They have been performing regularly in this "isolated island" in the form of spoken drama for two years now. To be able to maintain it for so long and gain so many audiences, I think it is really not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>I remember once meeting their person in charge. He told me: "Drama cannot be separated from the masses. We are able to have today completely because of the support of a large number of audiences." Because if there are no audiences, how can we stand firm? He also said: "We have clearly seen this point. Most of the people who come to see the play are from the leisure class, and it is this part and other parts of the people who need to be educated by drama. It is not easy to attract this part of the people, especially the ladies, but now they have become our regular audiences. Every time we change a new play, we always have their patronage."</p>
<p>However, we have to say that when we treat this part of the audience with a straight face and seriously teach them, it would be too inappropriate! People spend money, and the main thing is naturally not to come to listen to lessons! However, we are prepared to make them be educated. For the sake of skill and education, we still cater to this part of the audience, but we don't excessively indulge them. We want to make them understand, every sentence must hit their hearts, and make them feel that we are very close to them and willing to sympathize, and then there will be influence. Even if we lower the standard a little, we are willing. -- Appropriately lowering it is still the skill of striving for the masses. Therefore, we have gained a large number of audiences, and at the same time, we can exert the due power of drama on this large number of audiences."</p>
<p>Regarding these, I hope that drama workers can accept the living facts with the greatest humility!</p>

<p>(18) Yongtan</p>
<p>Yongtan was once banned in the past because the expressions and lyrics were too obscene!</p>
<p>Especially in low-taste amusement venues, they use purely pornographic performances to numb the audience.</p>
<p>Once, at a festive banquet, I saw them perform a play called "Swinging the Lake Boat," and the interlude was "Eighteen Touches," touching one place, singing one place, performing earnestly, without any scruples! The male actor also took this opportunity to take advantage of the female actor. This example shows that it cannot exist without serious reform.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Actors and Opium</p>
<p>Da Yuan's qin teacher was his uncle, Mr. Chen. Every night he would visit his home. Da Yuan worked very hard, so even though he was using Qing Kui's method of getting injections to quit smoking, the homework of practicing his voice every night was still uninterrupted. Who would have thought that after a few days, his voice felt unwell. At the same time, Gao Laoqing also discovered this problem. After testing it with a huqin, not only could he not produce a single word, but even speaking was so hoarse that he couldn't be heard. Da Yuan was almost scared to death when he heard this. He thought to himself, we make a living by our voice, relying entirely on this throat. If the capital is lost, then there will be no food for the rest of our lives. Therefore, he immediately dismissed Dr. Guo, relit the lamp, and started smoking again. Fortunately, he realized it early, so his voice was not affected. Unfortunately, Qing Kui's good voice was finished. If it weren't for Chu Cheng Lao Si's old friendship, inviting him to teach opera at the opera school and earning two hundred and eighty yuan a month, he would probably have starved to death. It was once rumored that Lao Qing committed suicide. It is said that one day, while chatting with teacher Cai (who also taught young male roles and was quite insidious and jealous), Cai asked him: How much do you earn a month? He replied: A hundred yuan a month. Cai then mocked him and said: You used to be a big star who earned ten thousand silver dollars a month. How come you only earn a hundred now? Someone like me earns a hundred and twenty. When Lao Qing returned home, the more he thought about it, the more unpleasant it became. He said to Lian Kui: This way, we might as well drink some opium paste and end this life. Later, after the family repeatedly dissuaded him, the matter was dropped. In all fairness, Qing Kui is a very generous person. Therefore, Sheng Linling's performance in "Golden Age" was so successful, achieving both fame and fortune, and returning north with praise. Lao Qing has a good son and can also hold his head high. (112)</p>

<p>Although Yan Chuntang has now handed over full authority of the Yihua Company to his two sons, Youxiang and Kejun, he still plans everything for the company in his spare time. Moreover, he occasionally visits the photography set to see the work efficiency of the actors. He saw that Sun Jing's performance in "Fragrant River Songstress" was excellent, and signed a three-year contract with him.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Drama Society performed "Sai Jinhua." Yan Chuntang took a fancy to her. The day before yesterday, he specially called the Xigong Theatre and booked several seats, personally accompanying Propaganda Director Ye Daidai to see the play. After watching it, he praised it greatly. Currently, Daidai is collecting the two scripts of Xia Yan and Xiong Fosi as a reference. However, whether he will adapt it himself or ask someone else to write it has not yet been decided. But Yan Chuntang's decision to bring "Sai Jinhua" to the screen is absolutely true. (Hua)</p>
