<p>社評</p>
<h3>外交之浪費</h3>
<p>愛和平，重然諾，是文明社會之習性；故暴力恣肆，信用掃地之事實敎訓，雖不一而足；頻年迭遭橫逆之餘，雖亦疾首痛心；然憧憬於和平，憧憬於諾言之容或可恃，嚮往之，追求之者，猶不知其凡幾。彼美國總統羅斯福氏於四月十五日致電德國元首希特勒氏與義國首相墨索里尼氏。為世界呼籲和平，為卅國請求保障，是習性未泯之代表作也。及希特勒氏於二十八日發表演說，同時，日本方面對於德義軍事同盟復有不擬參加之非正式表示，五六日來，一般情緒，似稍寗靜；即各方議論，雖仍衆口一辭於危機依然，緊張之現狀並未改善，然又竊喜於外交之門未闔。謂和平無把握，謂諾言不可信，况無諾言；然所謂外交，非必以和平與諾言為基礎者歟？基礎不立，外交之門雖洞開，顧奚益？</p>
<p>歐美各國朝野，對於希特勒氏演辭之反應，弛緩之甚；衡以常理，表面之弛緩，始別有其內部之醞釀，而決非以弛緩終。祗就目前言之：英國雖不放棄其反侵略集團之組織，以及實施徵兵制之政策：然對於希特勒氏所示好於英國之部份，欣然取為閣議之話題；而於希特勒氏相互保障之說，亦視為不妨嘗試之途徑。英法蘇之三角締盟，頻傳經過良好，然進退揖讓之丰度，固猶保持承平氣象，儼然盛世，非謀所以應急也。希特勒氏獨不諒波蘭，於是反應之最見緊張者，似亦僅限於波蘭一隅。至於美國，方擬根據希氏之說，更就外交常軌，搬演第二方程式，以為相互保障云云，亦必有答案可求，未欲輕輕放棄機會。諸國於日本所透露之態度，則以為反共協定既不改為軍事同盟，歐美即無東顧之憂；倫敦巴黎之報紙，且視此為時局中之重要因素；蓋謂此「於保持和平，實有莫大裨益，並得以重大影響，加諸英日關係，而為兩國經濟合作，闢一蹊徑」云。</p>
<p>以我人所觀感，國際大局之如何趨歸，關鍵全不在此。以歐洲而論：德國之理論，每為中小學之歷史地理課本所能解答，而為歐美政家為之結舌者。彼謂未嘗侵略，此在理論上以天然願望與生存空間為論據，事實上以各國答稱未受威脅為明證。以彼論據，得隨時選擇歷史上最有利於日耳曼民族之一片段為之張目。以曾吾威脅遍詢於各國者，獨不必詢及已亡之奧地利與捷克，亦不必詢及斷送米美爾之立陶宛，力圖保全但澤之波蘭。即以捷克問題而論，則於鼓煽內江之後，固以接受請求而予以保護，此其形式，諉為非侵略可也。且若德波互助協定，英德海軍協定，在四月二十八日之前，有何價値，為一問題，然一朝片面宣吿廢棄，英波奈之何哉！於是言之，即使德國循羅斯福氏之提議，予每一國以保障；即使如一般人士之期望，入外交之門，且各與之訂立協定；然誰得保證之以決不隨時廢棄乎？誰得保證之以決不鼓煽少數民族之引狼入室乎？更以遠東而論：日本之是吾與德義相狼狽，何在乎盟約？惟視日本之實力而已，惟視各方所予日本之機會而已；機會所予，實力所及，行動隨之，何待乎盟的？新南羣島之佔據，非其例耶？總之，侵略行動乃侵略政策之產物。侵略政策視侵略工具為轉移；居今日而向侵略者祈禱和平，或私相欣慰於侵略者之暫不擴展侵略，終必貽噬臍之悔。謀所以底定國際秩序者，不在徵詢侵略者之意見，不在窺伺侵略者之態度。要在採行有效之方法，制止侵略；除此而外，無論精力時間，語言文字。皆浪費也。</p>
<p>國民精神總動員開始</p>

<p>最有意義</p>
<p>的一個復興民族的紀元日、而且今日正是勞動紀念節、中正耍向全國同胞、說明個人的期望、同時更要乘此機會、對我們陷落在敵霓蹂躪之下的同胞、鄭重喚起共同的努力、現在我們整個國家民族、處在存亡勝敗的關頭、抗戰進到嚴重緊張階段、二十二個月的戰爭、已經顯明的指出抗戰必勝的前途、但是冥頑殘暴的敵人、還在盡量的想發揮他的獸性、並且想加緊的來</p>
<p>征服我們</p>
<p>所以我們更不可有絲亳懈怠疏忽、更要加緊的來努力奮鬥、因為我們最後的勝利、要從我們堅强的抗戰中、和必勝的信念中來產生的、我們耍從今天起、澈底檢討自已精神上的缺點、要從今天起、更要在精神上澈底的除舊布新、革面洗心、作一個劃時期的努力、要使從前的缺點譬如昨日死、今後的精神、譬如今日生、以煥然一新的精神、作艱苦森嚴的戰爭、今天的典禮、等於全國精神總動員的誓師、就是全國精紳總動員的宣誓、我們要向鼻祖炎黃和我們總理在天之靈宣誓、從今天起、我們一定要徹頭徹尾、來履行</p>
<p>國民公約</p>
<p>洗刷過去畏難好逸苟且偷安的各種缺點、完成我們對國家對先烈的責任、我們要向抗戰以來殉國將士、殉難同胞宣誓、從今天起、一定能加倍努力、為他們報仇、為國家雪恥、一定能加倍努力、繼續先烈的血路前進、今天正是五月的第一天、在這一個月裏　前前後後、排列着許多敵人侵略我們的國恥紀念日、我們眞是觸目驚心、痛上加痛、我們中華民族、每一個</p>
<p>黃帝子孫</p>
<p>都要在今天立志、決心使國恥的五月節、耍變為雪恥五月節、說到這裹、我要首先對我淪陷區域內同胞、表示無限的掛念、我們華北同胞、尤其是我們東北的同胞、和京滬·滬杭·北寗·正太·膠濟·平綏·平漢·粵漢·廣九·津浦·隴海·各條鐵路綫上、以及其他淪陷區域內的全體同胞、允其是我們前輩父老們、我和你們各位、雖然不能常常見面的講話、但我的心靈、沒有一時一刻、不和各位的意志相貫通、你們在這種淪陷的悲慘中過生活、我是沒有一天不想念着你們這種苦痛的、你們兩耳等着</p>
<p>我軍捷音</p>
<p>兩眼望着河山收復的情緒、我亦沒有一天不懸在心頭、你們在敵人鐵蹄暴力之下、忍苦堅持、誓死掙扎、努力保待着我們中華民族人格的種種努力我和全體將士同胞、每聽到一决你們殺死一個敵人、焚燬一回敵貨、我就比接到前綫勝利的消息還要感動、還要歡喜因為你們能在敵人後方、亦就是我們淪陷區域內、殺害一個敵人的效果、比在前方陣綫上打死一百個敵人的效果還要大、所以我們淪陷區內的同胞、只要在精神上能</p>
<p>抵抗敵人</p>
<p>打擊敵人、不與敵人合作的力　、就是等於我們軍隊官兵在戰綫上作戰一樣的有功、我們在前方官兵同胞、不但是十分想念你們在淪陷區內的艱苦、而且是十分感激你們這種堅忍奮鬥的精神、我們政府官兵、時刻不忘的是什麽、就是為要不愧對你們、所以要如此再接冉厲、始終不懈、為要一定來援應你們、</p>
<p>解放你們</p>
<p>所以要如此持久抗戰、不惜任何犧牲、我們今天舉行國民精神總動員、我首先耍對你們各位父老姑嫂兄弟姊妹慰問、我知道你們無論在怎樣危險艱苦的狀况之下、也一定能接受這個運動、實行這個運動的、我們大家都是黃帝子孫、戰爭只能暫時隔絕我們形跡上的接觸、可是隔不了我們愛國良知、和我們血脈情感的交流、在這個時　、如果我們國民之中、還有</p>
<p>醉生夢死</p>
<p>的、還有苟且偷生的、還有自私自利的、還有意志紛歧的、還有不知奮發自强的、那就不是我們中華民族的同胞、亦就不是我們黃帝的子孫了、我現在希望住居在遠離後方、如天津·上海·漢口·租界內的、以及海外與杳港等地各位僑胞們、尤其是我們一般靑年子弟們、要切記你們國家的仇恨和恥辱、在精神上要自立自强、在生活上要自愛自重、要負責、要知恥、因為是我聽見上海·天津·漢口·來的中外人士報吿說、我們在租界上的靑年、還有跳舞遊蕩、</p>
<p>不知自愛</p>
<p>的、我聽了　話、實在是非　的痛心、你們應該都耍自已知道、是在敵人壓迫之下的一個憂患困苦的孤臣孽子、所以格外要克勤克儉、耐苦耐勞、特別要以勞動為本分、以服務為目的、無論在何地何時、要自立自强、切勿被敵人輕侮、更要為友邦人士敬愛、如他們看了我們靑年國民皆能明理義、知廉恥、有志氣、有血心、能勤勞、能節儉、那他必對我們國家前途、就能發生無窮的希望、並且能够提高我們國家的人格、這就是先要我國</p>
<p>男女同胞</p>
<p>一致履行國民精神總動員的信條、力行國民公的的誓詞、就是要（一）不逮背三民主義、（二）不違背政府法令、（三）不違背國家民族的利益、（四）不做漢奸和不做敵國的順民、（五）不參加漢奸組織、（六）不做敵軍和漢奸的官兵、（七）不替敵人和漢奸帶路、（八）不替敵人和漢奸探聽消息、（九）不替敵人和漢奸做工、（十）不用敵人和漢奸偽銀行的鈔票、（十一）不買敵人的貨物、（十二）不賣糧食和一切物品給敵人和漢奸、如此、在精神上</p>
<p>武裝起來</p>
<p>不受敵人暴力威脅、不受敵人利益引誘、表現出我們的獨立自强、臨危不懼、臨難不苟的氣節、使敵人要格外畏　恐懼、而不敢來輕侮壓迫、總之、臨到抗戰重要關頭的今天、我們不分前方與後方、乃至淪陷區域任何地點、都要實行國民精神總動員、厲行國民公的就是澈底的來實行</p>
<p>禮義廉恥</p>
<p>的新生活、從今天為始、大家都要立定這一個決心、不愧為一個獨立自强的國民、同胞們、還要知道精神總動員運動、不是祇憑五分鐘的熱血、可以收效的、我們必須要持久不懈、要久而堅强、所以要有恒心不斷、精神動員的目的、不僅要在今天淬勵我們每一個人的精神、艱苦奮鬥、還要在持久鍜鍊之中、創造我們國尺新的生命和</p>
<p>新的精神</p>
<p>我們要不斷檢討自己、磨礪自己、鞭策自己、湯之槃銘曰『苟日新、日日新、又日新』、我們必須有這種日新叉新的覺悟和决心、不斷革新、不斷奮鬥、不斷加强我們人力物力、來打破敵人殘暴在妄的侵略、實現我們偉大的三民主義、各位同胞們、你們要　這今日的請神動員和國民公的、就是我們無形的槍砲、和無上的</p>
<p>飛機炸彈</p>
<p>換言之、這精神動員和國民公的、亦就是抗戰的最大武器、而我們國民月會的組織、就是我們抗戰民衆的精神堡壘、所以我們必要澈底實行、而且要始終無間、這樣力行下去的功效、一定是比任何鋼骨水泥的砲台要塞、還要有價值、還要有力量、所以國民月會開始以後、我們切不可如同從前辦事一樣的</p>
<p>奉行故事</p>
<p>必須剗除舊時敷衍塞責的惡習、而必要按照綱領規定辦法、切切實實的來身體力行、須知國民月會就是我們精神革新　暮鼓晨鐘、今日敵人侵略我們中國、到處姦淫燒殺、無所不至、常我們中國人、比牛馬猪狗都不如、這種恥辱、是比殺父之仇</p>
<p>還要慘痛</p>
<p>我們每一個人、應該刻刻反問自已、『你豈忘記了敵人侵犯你的國家、屠殺你同胞的大仇了麼、你豈忘記了搶爾土地、炸爾房子、殺爾父子兄弟、汚爾母女姊妹之恥辱了麼』、如果我們天天能這樣的警省惕勵、自反自勉、互相切磋、自然不會去做這樣醉生夢死、苟且偷安的胡思妄行了、我們並且要進一步再想到我們五十年來的</p>
<p>奇恥大辱</p>
<p>鉅創深痛、一定更能人人振作、個個奮發、達到復仇雪恥、抗戰娃國的目的、從今天起、開始國民月會以後、不僅希望大　都能誠心誠意、率先實踐躬行、還要誠心誠意互相勉勵督責、我們要造成一個新氣象、一面要社會中堅份子樹立模範、負責倡導、一面還耍大家彼此監察、規過勸善、互相勉勵、在今天我們各人若是</p>
<p>獨善其身</p>
<p>即是救亡的、我們要認定如果有一個同胞、或有一個同事的人、不能實行精神動員、就是我們全國的恥、我們要抱定公忠熱誠的心腸、不但要自己負責任、守紀律、而且要父子相勉、上下相勸、共同督責來策進的、我們耍厲行考核督察互相砥礪觀摩、普遍發揚我們中華民族固有的</p>
<p>崇高偉大</p>
<p>的精神、我希望從今起、國家普遍發揚復興的一個新氣象、我們看歷代艱難締造開國之時都有一種刻苦耐勞、蓬勃奮發的朝氣、和憂勤惕厲的精神、如果這種精神不衰退下去、無論如何就不會亡國、試看晋末五季宋明末葉、朝野瀾漫、在一種醉生夢死、自私自利的風氣、和空虛散漫、紛岐錯雜的情形、我們更要時時刻刻想到</p>
<p>歷代興亡</p>
<p>的敎訓、追思祖宗締造的艱難、抱定決心奮鬥努力來完成雪恥復仇的責任、我們均須痛切自覺、要知道這時期的國難、完全是我們這一代的沉迷墮落不爭氣的結果、如果我們這一代不能復仇雪恥、眞是上無以對祖宗、下無以對子孫、今天竟有少數</p>
<p>漢奸敗類</p>
<p>和意志薄弱、精神喪失之徒、來作無廉恥的賣國勾當、這實在是我們國家的恥辱、和不幸、但我們每一個有志氣有血心的炎黃子孫、要決心對國家盡大忠、對民族盡大孝、就是耍忠於責任、忠於職守、忠於法令、忠於紀律、來完成我們責無旁貸的抗戰建國的使命、我們國家</p>
<p>百世興亡</p>
<p>、千秋榮辱、就要看我們在這千載難得的革命時代、能不能澈底實行國民精神總動員的信條、能不能厲行國民公的的規條、能不能切實執行抗戰建國綱領、如果皆能實行、那我們必能在『國家至上、民族至上、軍事第一、勝利第一、意志集中、力量集中』、之大目標之下、共同團結精神、來粉碎敵人的侵峪政策、實現我們三民主義、完成我們革命建國的大業、各位同胞、再會罷、」（一日電）</p>

<h3>德意侵略下　歐局的激盪</h3>
<p>— 吳景崧</p>
<p>捷克的覆滅，米美爾的被德國兼併，以及阿爾巴尼亞的遭意大利侵佔，這不但是使東南歐各小國如波蘭，羅馬尼亞，立陶宛，保加加利亞，南斯拉夫，希臘，以及前主張與法西軸心和解的在近東的土耳其，感覺到他們獨立生存的危險，並且也使張伯倫達拉第之流的西歐民主國政治家，感覺到他們好夢的幻滅，而起來作亡羊補牢的辦法，這與其說是張伯倫達拉第等心理上有所覺悟，政策上有所改變，無寗說這是由於環境的壓迫事實的要求，以及輿論的攻擊，使他們不得不然。</p>
<p>在今日歐洲形勢日趨危殆的時候，有三個特徵，値得我們特別注意：第一，是東歐各小國，怵於捷克，阿爾巴尼亞，慘遭法西血腥的手慘酷的毀滅：他們知道法西國家的眞面目，一致改以往那種與法西國家親善的態度，而求怎樣自存之道。我們知道述在一九三四年的時候，波蘭看到英法兩大國政策的動搖，對於此後的德國，總作很大的政治與經濟的讓步，當然這樣讓步的結果首先受損失的，必然是那些與德國或意大利鄰近的國家，於是那時的波蘭外交部長柏克上校，便馬上採取親德政策，與德國締訂以十年為期的不侵犯條的，德國也正好利用道樣的政策，以削弱法國在東歐重要衛星的一　。德國對於近在手裏的波蘭走廊問題，不加注意，而把牠的目光轉移於奧捷方面，結果，希特勒達到了吞併奧國的目的。在這以後，常德國攫取蘇台德區域的時候，波蘭也趁火打刦，從捷克佔領了德申區（Teschen），這一區域，波捷在一九一八年到一九二〇年，曾引起過糾紛，現在，波蘭終於如願以償，這自然是一件得意忘形躊躇滿志的事。不但這樣，波蘭甚至和匈牙利勾結，圖謀瓜分捷克東部以達建立與匈共同邊界的目的。波蘭這種利己的企圖，如果沒有得到德國納粹的允許必不敢這樣猖在的。我們知道希特勒左右手的戈林於去年春天訪問波蘭外長柏克的時候，曾向他提議，波蘭應吞併捷克的東部，如果這目的達到後，匈牙利自不免失望，為補償匈牙利的損失，匈牙利可侵佔羅馬尼亞領土的一部分，作為交換條件。納粹黨對於東歐的政策是用心非常險惡的。他們鼓勵波蘭人去欺騙他的同盟國羅馬尼亞，而與匈牙利勾結起來，一方面使牠作宰割捷克的帮兇，一方而則挑撥羅波感情，以為作個別擊破的預備。</p>
<p>至於南斯拉夫的對德政策，事實上也和波蘭差不多。在德國吞併奧國以前，南斯拉夫親德的色彩早已很濃厚了。德南兩國大昌的來往頻繁，政治上經濟上的密切合作，早為人所共曉的事實，並且自去年起，南斯拉夫的軍隊裏，以往所購於英國的軍火，早已用德國的軍火來代替。後來德國保證德南兩國現在邊界，必不改變，這都可證明希特勒在對東南歐的外交政策上。是一帆風順，無往不利的。</p>
<p>可是這一形勢，納粹的併吞整個捷克，囊括米美爾，以及預備收回但澤及波蘭走廊而完全改變。德國的攫取米美爾，正如前波蘭總理席酷爾斯基（Sikorski）所說：「柏林攫取米美爾和對立陶宛施壓迫後，現正從北方對波蘭包圍，波蘭現已受挾制於德國的鉗形中。這對於波蘭乃是一件極應關心的了」。雖則如倫敦泰晤士報訪員傳出波蘭反對加入反納粹集團，雖則德國海通社方面傳出波蘭不改變牠的以往外交政策，遵守一九三四年德波不侵犯條的，可是波外長的訪英，以及與英締訂互助軍事協定，證明波蘭巳感到她有與其他民主國家成立聯合陣錢以保障其自身安全的必要。</p>
<p>正當英國宣言保障波蘭安全的時候，法西斯主義另一軸心的意大利，為對其老伴希特勒呼應，打擊英法，突然向南歐小國阿爾巴尼亞來一套全武行，占領了阿國。這一方面，是對西歐國家一種示威，一方面，也可以講是法西侵略應有的步驟。我們知道，意大利法西發言人蓋達（Gayda）在去年六月的時候會經說過，「意大利的外交政策，有兩個要點，一個是集中於菲洲，一個是集中於近東」。又說：「意大利的外交，也不會放棄了巴爾幹」。侵佔阿爾巴尼亞，就是對巴爾幹對近東進攻的開始，這一政策，自然是前幾月大呼「突尼斯，柯錫加與尼斯」之另一方面的表現。墨索里尼在阿爾巴尼亞的行動，不但使英法在東地中海的地位受到影響，而且引起了世界回敎民族的憤怒，（因為阿爾巴尼亞人大部分是回敎徒）希臘的驚懼羅馬尼亞的焦慮土耳其的隱憂。這樣一來，使鄰近於這兩個軸心的小國，都明白做這個劊子手的鄰居，沒有和平可講，沒有生路可走的。希臘凖備應付非常事變軍備集中，南斯拉夫也下令局部動員，這是在軍事上的表現。至於在外交上則有羅馬尼亞外長加芬柯（Gafencn）的訪土，與土耳其外長薩拉吉格露（Saragogin）的會晤，討論增加雙方防備侵略的辦法。這都是證明由於法西斯的侵略，東南歐各弱小民族巳改變了他們的政策，而希望西歐民主國家的能够起來援助他們，領導他們，以與威脅他們生存的法西主義對抗。</p>
<p>第二英國由於事實的敎訓，如西班牙德意侵略軍隊的不撤退，足以威脅她的龐大帝國的安全，以及現在法西國家所進攻的目標，如希臘·如波蘭·如羅馬尼亞，皆和她有切身利害關係。於是我們居然聽到張伯倫也在國會中宜佈援助波羅希等國了，我們同時聽到的，是國會中極右翼的邱吉爾，自由黨的辛克萊，及工黨的阿特里等人，一致要求與蘇聯合作，以保衛歐洲和平的呼聲。在這樣的時候，發出這樣的吼聲，我們可以斷言，是有相當力量的。以前張伯倫及其領導下的保守黨死硬派，為了他們情感上利益上反對蘇聯，想盡種種方法，慫恿法國與蘇聯分手，把蘇聯排斥於歐洲之外，而讓納粹的德國，可以放手吞併中東歐弱小民族的領土。結果，　應遺患，造成了希特勒獨覇歐洲，危害英帝國安全的趨勢。英國為其自身安全，為防止法西國家的再行發動侵略暴舉，就不能不改變其以往的政策慫恿法國，再與蘇聯接近。據最近消息，英國現在採取愼重步驟，使蘇聯加入反希特勒集團。法國現亦正與蘇聯從事締結新協定，在德國發動侵略時，自動援助。新協定的內容大致是：「如果有一天法國加入抵抗德國的侵略，蘇聯立卽對波蘭。羅馬尼亞。兩國加以援助。」同時英國也準備與蘇聯成立空軍協定。英國駐蘇大使希德爵士（SirSeed）晋見蘇聯外長李維諾夫，以及英駐法大使接到政府訓令開始與法國談判，這都表示英法蘇和平陣綫的新結合正在進行中。至於這和平陣綫的新結合，是吾能有强固的基礎，這重心還看英國保守黨如張伯倫之流的實利主義派，對於以往的錯誤觀念，有吾眞正的覺悟。法國前外長台爾博，最近在他的「自由陣錢的恢復」一文中，會經說過，「如果像法國一樣，英國曾在較前的時期，與波蘭小協的國蘇聯結合，歐洲不會見到最近武力的暴行。」這是一針見血的話。所以今後歐局的重要關鍵，還要看英國現執政者的政策，有沒有根本的改變，這是我們很値得注意的一個問題。</p>
<p>第三値得我們注意的，乃是最近美國羅斯福總統兩次和平呼籲，對於目前危急的形勢，有重大的意義。他說：極權國家如果眞的逼成戰爭的時候，在他們動手之初，即有一個國家比德意兩國合成的力量，允見偉大的，將牽涉在內，這就是講，美國對於歐洲戰爭發生，將不能置身事外。這個警吿，不啻給獨裁者一個當頭棒喝，雖則羅斯福總統的宜言，就目前講，還只是一種道德的力量，可是我們不難想像不久將見諸行動。羅斯福隨後的向兩獨裁者呼籲保證歐洲及近東各小國不受侵略，至少達十年或二十五年之久，就是行動的表現。這種表示，也可以直接證明民主國家的一大支柱的美國，目前並非對於侵略者，漠不關心，相反的美國正在增强民主陣綫的勢力。換句話說，世界民主陣綫的團結，目前更趨堅固，而足以給法西斯一種嚴重的打擊了。</p>
<h3>社會上。家庭間。閨房中。到處可聞——　一片愛用面麗聲</h3>
<p>信譽良好。歷六年如一日　品質特殊。春夏秋冬可用。　功效確切。除斑去瘰白嫩。</p>
<p>一種物品的好壞。絕對不是武斷或誇大所可取信於人。上海同仁西藥社出品的「面麗」。也是不願加以誇大或武斷的。不過就拿過去五年的歷史來講。已很可以證明「面麗」確是名實相符的高貴美容劑了。過去五年中。美容化妝品風起雲湧。不知翻了多少花樣。但「面麗」始終是站在第一塊牌子。始終受到社會人士的歡迎。並不曾感受到一點威脅。這因為「面麗」的品質。無日不在精益求精。即如香味的調製。亦有ABCD四種的發明。而除雀斑面皰和白嫩皮膚的功效。也在跟各人所用的經騐而日益顯著。別種化妝品。越多用越有害。只有「面麗」是越多用越有益。聰明的仕女們。常常拿這兩個有趣的問題。來做美容品的研究。結果「面麗」是逃不了公正的讚美。和熱烈的擁護。現在的社會上。無論家庭間。閨房中。以至各個階層裏。談起「面麗」。大家稱好。說起「面麗」。大家愛用。已成為各個人心理中不可磨滅的影象了。因此各大藥房和各大百貨公司裏。在每天都充滿了購買「面麗」的聲浪。這可見不是徼倖得來的虛名吧。</p>

<p>昨日（二日）本市現金烚赤暗　市况、由　　突轉平　、大致呈先漲後跌之勢、二千一百三十元大關　衝出後忽復回入、終見步退至二千一百二十元低價收市、市勢已漸轉入正軌、各方人心漸見安定、乃明知前日所傳種種不利消息、　　動搖中國整個業固之金融也、初因　兌業　證券幫德孚代北幫賢本、市富商仍有購吸、且在大漲後不免稍有餘波、會升壬三干一百三十四元高價、然金號傾售極勇、銀樓幫亦供多余少、午　價始不支、下午於獲利多頭出　下、跌勢更猛、終則軋過反　跌　七元、交易由盛轉稀共約八百兩左右、首　金未見　跌、甚出意外、　金與中英純金均平、</p>
<p>交易則由盛而轉稀</p>
<p>自最每條十兩、初開由買方即減二千一百二十七元、但售者三十元方肯供給、雙方　持至九時三刻方見成交、首由證券幫吸進某金號一十兩、二干一百三十元爲開　價、較之前（一日）收做高三元、開後某錢兌業亦吸進某金號五十兩、價與晨開相同、　之某錢兌　又進金號五十兩、價二十九元、此後某銀號（代外行）與證券幫互相吸購、　勢步高、其銀號進某金號五十兩、價卅一元、銀樓幫進同業五十兩、價三十二元、錢兌業亦互做五十兩、後證券幫進錢兌業五十兩、價三十四元、此後因某金號賣　愈濃、趁高力　不已、市勢即告回下、計售予錢兌業五十兩、價三十一元、時進者更缺、當又　落六元、某金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、價退爲二十五元、其時某銀號　來活　吸收、復向上升、計某銀號進銀樓幫五十兩、價三十元、後因某銀號止進、且金號再來吐售、當再向下挫、金號賣予證券幫五十兩、價二十六元、錢兌業賣予銀樓幫五十兩、價二十四元、後某銀樓售予某金號五十兩、價退爲二十一元、繼之再售予某金號五十兩、價二十二元、午刻另一金號進某銀樓五十兩、回高至二十五元、作爲午後價、聞收後銀樓幫與錢兌業曾喊二十二元賣出、但進者觀望、致未聞成交、午後交易突然轉清、成交不滿百兩、但爲狀略向下　、首由錢兌業五做二十兩、價二十二元、此後供求均稀、價亦呆定、直至四時後又見金號賣予某銀號五十兩、二千一百二十元爲　收價、結果較之隔昨　收軋跌七元、全天十四元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百二十八元、收進二千一百十三元、現標金照　牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金懸二百十六元</p>

<h3>外幣上漲益銳</h3>
<p>昨英純金未更、英美滙兌升〇六二五、本埠外滙、洋行結款甚殷、津帮吸收亦暢、幸銀行供給尚盛、市價穩定、惟遠期趨緊、求結不易、烚赤於週一猛漲五十元餘、昨市稍平、惟波盪亦達十四元、外幣英美金鎊、因烚赤劇漲、殷富吸納甚暢、英美金票因外滙遠期軟弱、客戶購買心切、交易甚旺、前日各外幣上升甚烈、昨日除英美金鎊外、仍多升　、公會交易甚旺、承泰出永　進美金票四百元、永　出鎭興進英金票五十鎊、祥康出承泰進美金票二百元、鎭興出鴻昌進美金票五百元、承泰出鑽興進英金票二十鎊、森泰出鎭興進英金票三十鎊、又出勤泰進香港票四百元、承泰出鎭興進英金票三十鎊、森泰出鎭興進英全票三十鎊、昨日市價较　一、英金鎊降一角、英金票降二分、美金鎊降一角、美金票升一厘、香港票降二厘、法郎票升七毫半、新加坡票降五厘、坎拿大票升五厘、菲律賓票升一分、澳金票升一角、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>英美滙需要驟旺　現貨未能儘量供給　退而猛結期貨不懈</h3>
<p>前日（五月一日）外匯市況、中英與滙豐　　均無上落、而暗市則略有變遷、情勢似稍带軟、蓋鑒當日報　「華興義行」即　成立、並須發行偽幣之消息、雖與我國整個金　、並無影響、但人心不免稍為激動、故當日天津帮與某方暗中傾扒現貨英美兩金不已、且各進口洋行、亦稍來扒結、故雖中外銀行供源尚不薄弱、然照英金八　士二五及美滙十六元零六二五之價、洋行多數結款、恐難如願、而期貨經各大洋行一再結扒、加之美銀行界扳價居奇、是以潛勢較緊、全日成交殊旺、至港　因經羣商投機家與洋行互相力吸、並外行供意淡薄、故市勢亦稍　軟、結果軋緊一二五、</p>
<p>昨日（二日）匯市、以華商紗花帮暨英行有利、（代津幫）與各大進口洋行等、互相力購现貨英美兩金、惟外行如匯　等對於洋行少數結款、尚肯供給、然巨額結款、恐　如願、鼓而扒結者稍感恐慌、遂猛扒期貨英美兩金不怠、巨外商銀行供源頗形薄弱、是以潛勢遂趨緊軟、丟掉期差價離開較大、若再行扳開、或將引起一般套利者之興趣、並東方突躍英塞美、做出匯兌價爲四元六角八分零六毫、全日交易殊旺、至港匯因外行供愈較淡、並洋行吸購頗力、故爲狀續趨軟化、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均漲（）六二五、紐約銀價呆定如故、倫敦生金亦仍呆定、匯兌英對美·對滬均平、對法小三生丁、美對英六〇六二五、對滬昂三分、對法升〇六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價英匯八　士二五、美匯十六元零六二五、較之前收均平、開後華商與洋行等爭先扒　、但外行如匯　等對於少數尚肯供　、計華商與洋行　進匯豐英行　其　外行等現貨英金八　士二五、兼現貨美匯十六元零六二五、迨匯豐掛　揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡和揭曉大半分、計徵百分之六·〇〇、其時洋行界　與更濃、又與華商紗花幫等頻吸期貨英美兩全、且外商銀行扳價不肯賤賣、潛勢頗軟、計洋行與華商紗花帮等結　莲匯豐本月份英金八辦士二一八七五、及購結大通本月份美匯十五元九三七五、繼又與華商扒進麥加利八月份英金　八辦士一二五、兼又結進某行八月份美滙僅十五元七五、將近午刻、東方購英塞美、做出匯兌價爲四元六角八分零六毫、此後洋行轉扒現貨港匯、且外行賣意淡薄、於是潛勞亦軟、洋行結進外行荷蘭現貨港滙僅五十五元半、迨午收現貨匯豐賣價、英金爲八辨士二五、美匯十六元零六二五、若洋行較巨之結款、不易籌結、港匯賣價爲五十五元半、</p>
<p>後市首由洋行稍來扒結、故外行尚肯供給、致潛勢平穩、洋行結進滙豐現貨英金八辦士二五、　之有利復代天津帮結進某行現貨美匯十六元零六二五、是以過程鲜少變化、入後外行賣予錢兌業現貨港滙五十五元六二五、爲狀略有回硬、迨晚收銀行賣價英匯八辮士二五、美匯十六元零六二五、港匯五十五元六二五、結果較之隔昨晚收、英美兩匯、均無榮辱、而港匯則軋緊一二五、</p>

<h3>糧食　麵粉廠盤步高　巳達四元四角半現鈔</h3>
<p>昨現粉廠盤、步見起色、查客帮銷塲、自上週末開展以來、南北兩帮成交頗多、二號紛售價亦自上週末開始提高後、逐見上展、良以國際風雲險惡、國外產價頻昂、而申地現存洋粉不多、雖有到埠、市面亦無重大影響、故廠方一再堅持、昨日上二號粉開盤竟再提升五分、曾到達四元四角五分之現钞、前昨兩日成交數共計十餘萬包、　昨日下午北洋帮整頓銷化已懈、因連日天津滙水劇跌、辦貨風險太巨、聞當地粉價尚高、擬待辦貨裝運後再行採取、南洋帮進胃亦較前兩日爲遜、至洋粉銷塲、仍見擯局、因市上供給不多、買賣均有互持狀態、結果中檔牌子比上週亦巳提升數分、聞建源公司等洋行今日新到花旗一船、額計廿萬餘包、該貨卸上藍烟囱碼頭、市面前途、須該貨出售後、或有變化、</p>
<p>至麵粉出口、昨有三萬七千七百包、運往天津、五干六百五十包、遠往汕頭、</p>
<h3>厚薄粳都到限盤</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源、河下共到蘇同帮六七號、而車輪包子來蘇同帮一千七百餘包、無錫聞某方允許每日運　五車、故到七百五十包、銷塲雖無賓胃、但因到稀、人心向上、市面本好、然以限價嚴厲、致高貨市上絕跡、而中市原包、無論厚薄粳價格、均已開出在限綫左右、杜洋尖埠尖大帮與粳市相同、變元因貨少、價續上升二三角、開出十九元出零、</p>
<h3>小麥來源遞增</h3>
<p>近日小麥來源、聞京鎭一帶及內地常州等處、逐有零星運到、滬上存底、已稍有堆積、而洋行自定之洋麥、最近亦有新到、除上次福新廠收進一船外、日商粉廠、亦曾向某洋行訂辦洋麥一船、故對於本麥需用、日見呆頓、惟在麵粉步漲聲中、執貨者尤思爭扎、故表面上尚堪站立、而實據僅開六元八角之價、尚乏相當受主、蓋洋麥現貨售價亦巳降至七元以内、市面恐仍難開展、</p>
<h3>行囤暢辦客秈　洋米存底匱竭</h3>
<p>客秈昨日到少銷旺、市面繼續向上、昨本街去路尚不踴躍、而行　則頗見貪、緣市上謠言極盛、一說轉口帮與日商又在產區直接辦裝、又傳產地將改用「偽鈔」、因此市面與人心一致向上、京蕪秈各漲一二角、洋米定貨尚差一元有零、而全滬存底祇有西貢一萬二三千包、小絞三千包、高西貢昨喊高至十七元六七角、次十七元三角許、小絞則有每市石十三元之價售開數十包、</p>

<p>五金交易、近頗暢達、採辦以北路爲大宗、貨品則新鉛絲·黑鐵坯子·馬口鐵·會司鐵·竹節鋼條·英鋼板等居多數、久趨寂寞之本廠元釘、昨市北路客商、羣起採辦、津烟等帮、辦去達三千餘桶之鉅、行惰每桶倍司爲十六元二角半、市貨一時被購殆盡、開價因之續高二角半、故最近市上、喊價須十六元五角云、</p>

<h3>紗花　獲利這回出　現紗價猛進疾退　廠方乘機又有大量開出</h3>
<p>前日（一日）紗市、發現最高峯價為四百五十元、旋經獲利者吐出稍挫、近來市塲波浪浩大而兎起鶻洛、變遷迅速、但實際交易、較為退化、客帮鑒於猛進疾退之狀、皆畏縮不敢輕易舉動、然一般投機者、受種種流言播弄、在市進出頻繁、以致成交熱鬧、市盤一日數變、惟大戶獲利者業已紛紛了結、但價回低時、拖進者殊見興奮也、午後傳言復熾、謂北帮仍以日偽幣紙下降、復來拖貨、人心重振、買風頓盛、市價立刻在跳四五元之譜、趨勢益覺紊亂不一、迨至收盤時略形回軟、茲據另一消息、廠方又有巨量開售之說、是吾尙待事實證明、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、因人心良好、微見漲風、開價加一元、二十支雙馬紗價為四百四十五元、棧單價為四百三十二·三元、客帮除汕頭帮購辦以外、其他無交易、旋以實需不旺、多方出籠賣戶擁擠、徐徐而下挫、一霎間跌去八九元、棧單　小價為四百二十二元、計跌十元、價洛後某某等又來吸收、又復回上三四元、收盤價現貨為四百三十五元、棧單價為四百二十五元、午後開盤平平、棧單價為四百二十五元半、少頃申新廠跑街某君收進二十支雙馬棧單紗幾百包、價格立刻上升、棧單做到四百三十元、外棧貨亦呌四百四十元、但客銷仍寥寥、收盤價稍回弱、查全日各帮買去統計一千六百六十五包、行情二十支雙馬大女均跌四·五元、二十支特金城跌十元以外、牧羊跌八元醒獅跌十元、雙地球跌八元、廠方未有舉動、昨日出口棉紗有二百二十件運天津二十五件運烟台、八百四十五件運汕頭、二百零五件運香港、又上日成交二千八百五十九包、廠開八百五十包、茲將各帮口買去之額錄左、</p>

<h3>本花廠胃開展</h3>
<p>印棉到銷各七八千　日廠飛花不再標賣</p>
<p>本棉生意、漸現活絡之象、售價帶昂、蓋以邇來紗價節節前進、加之外棉採換價較昂、致人心挺秀、申新新裕兩廠採辦原棉獨健、其他廠家仍乏需要、至於花號方面、本棉現貨缺乏、而來源不暢，大都改營外棉、蘇北來源陸續而到、然額量殊微、前日到通花七百二十八包、昨又到二百四十八包、茲將現棉兩日來成交之情形列左棉市價、紐的棉市、前日因各方反對政府棉花出口津貼頗烈、故引起多頭了結、價格下跌十磅音、然出口津貼之潛伏亦頗强大、如能實現、市價仍有極大變化、昨日各同業紛紛近期結價、因之近期漲十餘磅音、遠期反跌十磅音、印棉昨日連同預測張二羅比、與週前相較、無甚軒輊、惟遠期滙兌奇緊、折合法幣棉價每担俱漲一元餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因近日紗價猛跳、引起外棉小額交易、前日各華廠訂購印棉共有四千包、品質以平果見及白洛區為多、價格俱在五十七及七十四元、咋日又有三千包交易、日廠方面以需棉甚殷、速日在市搜購現貨頗力、前花號之到貨、大部業已售與日廠、並出價頗高、故各花號均樂與交易也、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠如下、</p>

<p>國布</p>
<p>前昨布市、因原料紗綫猛烈上漲、東定首先橫跳、國布亦即發現空前漲風、白貨以囤戶心思最稱熱烈、粗布每疋加價五角至一元、英商怡和廠輕重磅各檔每疋普遍加起一元以上、細布細斜每疋亦暴升一元左右、、永安大鵬細布由上週十四元二角半升至十五元五角、申新富貴，細斜由上週之十二元九角升至十四元、現銷各客帮以貨價暴漲、進意淡薄、暫取觀望態度、僅有散額數十件成交、本街囤胃尚有餘力吸納、粗布細布細布二百餘十件、漂染布定中以時令關係、淺色貨有飽和狀態、而深色貨方屆發軔之初、故深色貨中存底最缺之嗶嘰綫呢每疋漲一元、綸昌九龍山嗶嘰由上週之十三元九角升至十五元、藍布色斜每疋漲五角至七角半、而淺色貨漲勢較弱、漂布每疋漲二角半至七角半、府綢等手貨亦略板高、綸昌印花貨花布每疋漲二角半、色丁克羅綢蔴紗等貨、均照原盤開售、成交以囤戶較盛、本街囤進綸昌花布元羽綢藍布直貢緞嗶嘰等貨近三百箱、本街門市及京蕪蚌埠各游擊區交易最盛、</p>

<h3>「華興銀行」僞券　江海關拒絕收受　銀錢兩業決亦不予接受　日僞破壞金融顯又失敗</h3>
<p>偽「維新政府」與日本各銀行合組之「華與銀行」、已於五月一日在新亞酒店舉行創立會、宣告成立、推定陳錦濤為總裁、日人驚尾磯一為副總裁、此外華人之參加該項非法組織、有前大陸銀行儲蓄信託部經理沈爾昌、字季宣、前金城銀行大連分行經理錢大機、字書城、前江浙銀行常務董事周文瑞等三人、該行成立後、決定發行偽券、據日方宣稱、外商銀行、已允接受此項僞券、事實如何、大有研究、至僞府各機關、將來自當行使此項偽券、但江海關方面、則已決定拒絕收受、日人原定計劃、在以偽券換取淪陷區域之貨物、以之易取法幣、再用法幣購外匯、但事實上淪陷區域、除城鎭外、鄉間仍為中國游擊隊所控制、非但無行使偽幣可能、且携藏偽幣、亦必發生危險、農民旣不願亦不敢以貨物售易僞幣、至於銀錢兩業同業公會會員行莊、決亦拒絕收受是項偽鈔、對於整個滬市金融亦不致蒙受重大影響、</p>
<p>限制貿易　藉圖支持</p>
<p>大陸報云、駐滬日總領事署參贊、咋（一日）在招待記者席上、答覆詢問、對於在滬限制貿易、藉以支持昨在虹口開業之華興商業所將發行之紙幣、作隱的之喑示、蓋渠對於商人有被迫向此銀行或日方卵翼下銀行獲取出口許可證之可能性、拒不預發任何言論、此即含有或將實施限制之意也、昨據經同盟社發出之文告稱、華興商業銀行資本「五千萬元」、依「維新政府」法律而組成、將發行可自山易成外幣之紙幣云云、</p>
<p>外滙來源　無從懸揣</p>
<p>最後數語、引起各記者紛向該參贊質問、該參贊答覆最初之問話云、華興商業銀行將按照與中國法幣同價之市價、以本行所發紙幣、無限制出售外匯、某記者問、此種外匯之來源為何、有可表示吾將自海關經出口許可而獲得之乎、如該銀行無限制供給外匯、則必可獲得無限制之數量矣、發言人云、目前無此種限制之意、有詢由此答語推測之、如公衆不以出口單交該銀行辦理、而自動支持之、則日當局將賢施與華北現有限制相類之限制乎、發言人答、以吾人之地位、目前不能討論將來之事、</p>
<p>該行資本　悉屬法幣</p>
<p>有詢華興商業銀行能吾有倫敦與紐的成立信用借款便利、參贊稱彼拒不答覆此問、有詢提議發行之紙幣、是吾由外幣或法幣為支持、或其資本僅記錄於賬簿、而有名無實者乎、參贊答將以法幣為資本、而以此發行紙幣、平價接受、某計，　　被拍為華與商業銀行總裁之僞「維新政府財長」陳錦濤所發文告事而詢曰、南京所稱法幣刻遇危機之說、發言人亦以為然吾、如法幣跌價、將發生何種情况乎、參贊稱、法幣不健全、乃「一般人均承認之事實一、但渠旋復承認將與法幣平價接受提議發行之紙幣、</p>
<p>資本分配　日僞各半</p>
<p>發言人以為第三國銀行之條例、不致妨礙新幣、並答稱、若干外國銀行已同意辦理新幣、有詢能舉此等外國銀行之名吾、參贊云、名單尚未完舉、目前渠不欲舉其名云、按昨日經同盟社發出之消息稱、華興商業銀行頃在新亞酒店舉行成立大會、陳錦濤被舉為該行總裁、前長春之滿洲「中央銀行」理事驚尾磯一為副總裁、該銀行之資本將「十足繳完一、計「維新政府」出資二千五百萬元、日本六銀行出其餘數、</p>
<p>僞幣不能　繳納關稅</p>
<p>又謂、該行紙幣將成為佔據區中之法定貨幣、正式付款及銀行商業往來、均將接收之、唯一之例外、為不得用以付關稅、但此種限制新幣之使用、據陳氏之宣言中稱、乃屬「暫時一性質云、日本參贊在昨日之招待記者席上雖稱新銀行所發紙幣、有堅强之支持、但顯有若干疑點、蓋參贊亦稱新幣以法幣為支持、而陳氏宣言中則稱法幣前途、「實不可逆料」者也、</p>
<p>聯準慘敗　前車之鑒</p>
<p>大陸報一云、中日合辦之華興商業銀行、昨（一日）晨在虹口舉行成立會、外籍各銀行家昨聞該銀行所宜佈之計劃、均表示不信任與驚訝、據不允發表其姓名之某高級外籍銀行家聲稱、外國銀行無論立塲如何、對於此銀行所發紙幣、甚且不願考慮接受處理之、聯準銀行之慘敗、可為前車之鑒、故此項事業、實乃幻想耳、</p>
<p>出口商決　不予合作</p>
<p>若其紙幣由外幣或法幣為支持、則投機家可制其命運，此種投機勢必繼續不斷、至外幣支持枯竭而後已、至此種紙幣將以外幣為支持一節、渠瞬間不之信、若決定以此種紙幣為繳付關稅之法定貨幣、則將由入口商　折扣購進之、渠不信日方有圖迫令出口商將出口單向不在上海以外之銀行辦理之任何可能性、且料出口商非遭强迫決不前往該行、取得出口便利、</p>
<p>獲得放款　事實困難</p>
<p>即使華興商業銀行紙幣以日元為支持、除依不可能之兌奉外、仍不能藉此在海外獲得信用放款、該銀行家復說明日　之　　　日　益枯窘例如任何日本銀行欲在紐的獲得信用放款、該行須以放款數百分之百之日政府公債貯存該紐的銀行、以為信用、且尚須另存百分之五十之日圓以外之外幣、此即欲得放款百兀、須有百分之一百五十之信用始能到手是已、聯準銀行之試騐、今已飽受教訓、該行前途如何、尚難逆料、而竟復開辦此新銀行、殊屬不解、</p>

<p>牲畜市塲　擅扣鮮猪</p>

<p>鮮猪同業　議决辦法</p>

<p>肉業拒賣　工人拒宰</p>
<p>鮮肉業自被一牲畜市塲「再壟斷後、因鮮猪來源缺乏、形成肉價飛漲、遭重大虧耗、因此決定拒買虹口運來之貨、而宰作業工人、亦決定拒宰該牲畜市塲」經售之猪、咋日起、兩租界內各菜塲內、鮮猪肉價格已飛　、</p>

<p>英下院亦　討論此案</p>
<p>路透社一日　敦電、上海雷士德工業學校校長李里博士撞車殞命事、今日英下院討論及之、外次白特勒謂此案事實現不明瞭、須俟詳細調查及受傷之李里夫人與維姆塞特捕頭陳述當時情形後、政府始能決定適當辦法云、保守黨摩廉問、英人歇芬夫人欲赴漢口往視其夫、但日人不允其前往事、英當局曾吾調查有無結果、白特勒答稱、日當局拒不發給歇芬夫人前往漢口之通行證、其理由何在、現尚未悉、此事猶在調查中云、摩廉繼問曰、外决果不知以歇芬反日份子、故拒不允許其夫人赴漢乎、前在漢口襄助肅淸華軍所置以阻日軍前進之炸彈、非即歇芬乎、此舉不足以證明日方所稱歇芬為反日份子之說完全無據乎、白特勒答稱、凡此數點、皆須於繼績調查時考慮及之、</p>
<p>日方見解　歸罪李里</p>

<p>關於限制米價一案、曾經豆米行業公會顧令民食、一再議決、最高限價仍維持每石十四元、三令五申、勸導各行商客帮、共同恪遵以來、市塲正式交易、雖趨為定但暗盤買賣、還是存在、實違背同業間商業上之道德、故該會為社除流弊、澄淸行市、謀一妥善辦法、作澈底之解決起見、特定於本月五日下午三時、邀集米號業公會。碾米廠業公會·常熟米業公所·經售米糧業公會·南帮公所·運米客船聯益會等行客七團體、舉行聯席會議、共資商討、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「不包括遠東在內」</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>反侵略組織的進行，若斷若續，究竞幾時會見諸實行，維也不能預料。鑼鼓喧天，就此不出塲來，也並不是意外事。當然，茲事體大，不能一蹴而幾，然而常事者，允其英國，一再徘徊却顧，不敢放肌進行，以致形成夜長夢多的局面，也是應負其咎的。</p>
<p>最近，我們又聽見這反侵略組織在進行談判的消息了。英蘇的始終願意從事於此，不肯輕易放棄，未始不是差强人意的舉動。然而據美聯社所傳，却說：「不包括遠東在內一點，雙方巳予同意；」又說：「此一決定，乃在星期六日蘇聯大使與英國外交部長會商時，由英方請求而成者。」這是什麼道理？會有什麼結果？眞值得我們的注意！</p>
<p>當初英蘇談判組織反侵略陣綫時，蘇聯原主張包括遠柬在內的。因為蘇聯不是呆子，她當然不肯一方面帮着中歐各國，從事反侵略，却一方面漠視了遠東的另一侵略國，而不予防備，聽由那侵略國從後面掣肘；此外，那侵略國原本是德義的一邱之貉，現正在侵略着中國，按之世界大局，彼此深切相關的事實，也不能不將這反侵略組織，擴大到遠東來。自從蘇聯提出這一個意見後，我們正在等待着正面的結果，現在，結果却落到了反面，這當然是使我們抱憾的。</p>
<p>英國的所以有此「請求」，理由是很易明白的：她的政策，一貫地防蘇聯，一貫地自保，而不肯眞正仗義執言，挺身而出，這裏姑且不要說，而最近，她一定又存着得過且過的心，以為遠東仍舊可以擱置一下。遠東侵略國不加入德義軍事同盟，也許她，英國，正在竊自慶幸着吧。至於她是吾接受重光葵的警吿（見東京路透電），那我們就無從究詰了。</p>
<p>不過我們的抱憾，並不全是為了我們自己。遠東侵略矚的所作所為，那一樣不是侵略的：對中國本身而外，獨佔中國的市塲，排斥各國在中國的商業利益，那一國不受到她侵略的影響。如果各國不予早日防止，如果她果然成了遠東的霸主，試問世界的和平，還會保全麼？所謂歐洲的反侵略組織，又那裏能竟其全功呢？我們抱憾：首先是英國的目光短淺，終將養應貽患；次之墳是她的不能澈底援助中國。</p>
<p>然而我們的抱憾，到底還是對外而言，並不是對內的。對內，對我們自己，我們非但不抱憾，反增加了我們極大的勇氣：我們要獨自肩負起遠東反侵略的全責，而完成全世界反侵略的大業！</p>
<h3>蘇聯女飛行家（上）</h3>
<p>— 保麗娜·奥雪朋哥作　何言譯自莫斯科新聞</p>
<p>奧雪朋哥是蘇聯最著名的女飛行家，她本是貧苦的農家女兒，這裏是她自述的奮國史。——譯者</p>
<p>我幼時連做夢也想不到我會做一個飛行家的，我的童年是消磨在烏克蘭的鄕村裏，在聶普洛貝特羅斯克省的諾服期配索卡的地方。我的父親為着我們的麵包而煩惱，我們的思想都被笨重的農具壓制着。</p>
<p>到了求學的年齡了，我書讀了不久，就為要做工帮助家庭而中輟，我的學年是這樣忽忽的過了。</p>
<p>二年級的畢業，僅學會了讀和寫，我就在農塲上做工。</p>
<p>一九二四年，我十七歲的那年，我加入了靑年共產黨聯盟。</p>
<p>一九二七年，我的家庭加入了集體農塲，我也被捲進了社會。</p>
<p>雖然我很幼穉，我也分別得出集體農塲和我父親——一個可憐的農夫——的田莊的不同。我想，假使我書多讀些，我一定會了解得更多。</p>
<p>不久以後，我們的集體農塲收到很多農業學校的入學證，我也請求讀書，就被送到基輔，讀着六個月的家禽養課程。</p>
<p>但我上過了第一課後，我立刻認識我的程度遠遜於其他同舉，他們都有七年的程度，而我只有二年的學歷。</p>
<p>我要回到集體農塲去嗎？不，我決不，甚至日夜工作，我也要留在這裏。我拚命讀書，我腦子裏充滿着「努力」，但是我成功了，六個月之後，我和其他的同學一起畢業。</p>
<p>於是我貢獻意見給集體農塲，在貝登斯克區組織了一個家禽畜養園。那裏，決定了我的命運。</p>
<p>一個夏天，來了二架飛機，隆隆的呌聲遮蔽了農塲上切的聲音。我站在門口，望着，不敢透氣。</p>
<p>飛機降落了，村子裏起了大大的紛擾，每個人，灰白鬍鬚和搖搖擺擺的都跑到田野裹，看這奇怪的束西，當然我是在第一羣人中間的。</p>
<p>奇怪使我目瞪口呆，我不曉得我看到的是飛機是人；我更不相信我的眼睛，在機身的外面，和飛機師在一起，有一個戴着皮製盔形東西的女人走着。</p>
<p>「哦！女人也能飛嗎？」我問她，我的好奇心勝過了羞怯。</p>
<p>「當然，她們會的。」她大笑着（我後來知道她不是飛行家，是一個看護）。</p>
<p>「你驚嚇嗎？」</p>
<p>「毫不。」</p>
<p>「我知道一個女飛行家在卡科佛。」一個飛行家說。</p>
<p>我回頭聽見，一個女人也能够成為飛行家的，或者我也能成功，為什麼不呢，我要去，我願意去，我堅決的決定了我將是一個「飛行家」。</p>
<p>這中間的一個，我知道是在塞巴斯拖堡的航空學校里讀書的，就絕不考慮的寫了一封信給他，我告訴他在我們村上停下來的飛機，飛機裏的女人和在卡科佛的女飛行家；我並且寫，我也想做一個飛行家，我今年二十三歲，體格健康，是靑年共產黨聯盟的會員，請他能不能帮我學習飛行？</p>
<p>他的回信到塞巴斯拖堡來，我們可以確定。</p>
<p>我去了。</p>
<h3>騎擊（木刻）</h3>
<h3>山花</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>在深邃的山谷中，茁放了許多無名的野花。紅的，熱情的顏色：閃耀着生命的光輝。</p>
<p>出谷，深邃的，寂寞的，荒凉的，很少有人跡。</p>
<p>封鎖着一段悠長的歲月，平靜的，騷擾的。賽會的鑼聲，塘間的蛙響，豆棚下的晚炊，荷鋤時的呼喚，窮巷的牛羊，新春的簫鼓：如是居諸的華月與流年，山谷中的野花，會看着我們，默默地，給我們記下了。</p>
<p>花開叉花落，在山谷中，流過了年年的春秋。山花是欣喜的。</p>
<p>衝破靜謐的氛圍，不知歲月的山野之夢。人與野獸間生一决巨大的急變。抵抗野獸的侵凌，人乃與獸搏鬥。為了這搏鬥，有許多勇士流盡鮮紅的血。毀傷了肢體，抑或貢獻了全部生命。勇士的血流下了，山花染成紅色。</p>
<p>地下長埋了，白骨與靑燐，馬上的豪語，大漠的風雲，蒼蒼的古戍，在芳草千芋時，確然你巳無法覓得思戀之憑藉。但我們殊可於山谷中，戰塲上，任意掇拾到一二朵殷紅的山花，性命的等閒，頭顏的輕擲，使你可了然於星辰的不死，日月的長存。魂來楓林靑，魂返關山黑，生命的茶火，不消失，也不模糊。展開了自由的歡笑，溫暖這無情的山谷，使我們永不忘記，這地上曾流過血：熱情的紅，豪邁的紅，絢爛的紅，給我們以奮興，以安慰。以鼓舞，以鞭策。</p>
<p>吹滿山谷，這腥風。生命窒息了。</p>
<p>唯有山花，猶兀然挺立於醜惡的山谷，密密的荊榛業中</p>
<p>風十分腥臭，說明野獸的猖在。勇士流下他們的血，很巧妙的把牠們用來作一種灌漑，培植成自由的花朵，還把牠們染成紅色。</p>
<p>人與獸的鬥爭中，有許多勇士愛植他們的花朵。撒下新生的種子，年復一年，山花簇簇地開放了，不紙在山谷中，也走下低原與平隰。曙色與曉風，吹開天地的腥腐。每一朵花，展開自由的羽翼。</p>
<p>沒有腥風了。透露山花的淸新，宇宙間一片晴光與淑氣</p>
<p>千千萬萬年的滄桑，換了花信的春風，小樓一夜來春雨，明朝便聽賣杏花聲，說不定海也枯，石也爛了的時候，山花終於依然：不枯，不黃，也不殘敗。</p>
<p>不是徼倖的偶然呵。你說，這山花，不，你該說勇士的靈魂，自由的啟蒙者，這不比那些平凡的花啊！</p>
<p>結束了殘餘的犬羊，給我們以幸福的享受。凡有山花處，皆萌芽了自由。</p>
<p>萌芽了自由，在我們誠然是幸福了，但我們不能忘記辛苦憔悴的園丁呵。</p>
<p>該謝謝他們血的裁培！</p>
<h3>精神與物質</h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>老早就是這麼一回事：西方談的是物質，東方的中國，談的是精神。</p>
<p>戊戌政變，維新運動抬頭，朝野爭言洋務洋務，洋洋盈耳。雖然那時候維新守舊兩派各有公婆的一番道理，然而棄精神取物質，多少總有點異樣的傾向。</p>
<p>歷史一向具備因果的條件，一件事的不容片面提出來，作一個單純的解答，正像抽刀斬水一樣的難。</p>
<p>這幾十年來的歐風美雨，濡染得中國人穿長衫着西裝袴。……</p>
<p>算了！你瞧！</p>
<p>一張法西斯獨裁者怪猙獰的面孔，一尊大炮，一列機關槍，聞開的還有毒氣呢－殺人不貶眼的，自然囉，上有飛機炸彈，下有裝甲和坦克。物質物質！殺人要自己束緊袴腰帶的，一片麪包由政府通過，發下命令，不能多啃一口，白塌休要想白白地塌，分配論塗改了好幾决，結果仍奮覆瓿。</p>
<p>中國有中國的歷史，說起來木來楚好的。不過天禍吾族的淸朝，橫的壓士氣，直的壓士氣，想出種種方法來摧殘士氣，弄得舉國死氣沉沉，以為帝皇萬世之業，這回總辦妥當了。然而羽翎軍沒有用，神拳的神還在九天玄妙之上，一時不肯下凡，於是開門揖維新，請物質先生來帮助，物質擾了一陣之後，精神更加困頓，一直到目前，精神脫鈎，釣上來一些膚淺的物質，「人之身體，就成死物」，「學者以多方喪生，大道以歧路亡羊」。</p>
<p>現在，舊賬一筆鈎銷，重新喚起精神！太阿可以倒持，授柄給人，毛瑟槍也靠不住的，因為打敵人，也可給敵人保駕。所以孫中山先生論到武器的使用，全在人的精神，會說：「兩者相較，精神力量居其九，物質力量居其一」。運用物質要有「權」！</p>
<p>事實告訴吾人，目前當某種人物的，從年齡分類上看起來，最多的是五六十歲的人，為什麼五六十歲的人特別多呢？難道他們生下來就是一副奸骨不成？這是受了淸朝壓迫士氣的餘毒，少壯時，便是「死物」，他們根本沒有精神，所以疑古玄同主張「一過四十歲即須槍斃」之說，言出有因，不是瞎說。</p>
<p>基於這樣的論斷，我們可以浮一大白，歡呼起舞而言曰：「某種人物的淘汰是時間問題，他們在精神上巳經自己宣告死刑，不值一提。」</p>
<p>為了時代的嚴重，我們得送往廢物，也不能不迎來新精神。所謂新精神，就是此時此地不容或缺的而為人類要求生存的精神，精神是士氣，是朝氣，是生氣，是無形的力量。因此：</p>
<p>我們的精神，要跟着戰時的進行，做到確實的進步；過去精神上的缺點，要在抗戰中洗滌乾凈；有職的盡職；有能力的盡能力；生活要嚴肅要緊張；前方和後方，確實做到同仇敵愾，休威相關，言行，表裏一致，結集到「國家至上，民族至上，軍事第一，勝利第一」的目標下；不搖，不奪，不欺，不偽，不趁火打刦，把一般社會生活跟牢戰時的條件。</p>
<p>這些能殺件件做到，那末，一份物質就可以當做十份物質來使用。吾則，一概歸於無權！</p>

<h3>不能生育子嗣　愛情何能融合？</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>有快樂之家庭，而後有健全之社會，有活潑之子女，而後有快樂之家庭，換言之，快樂之家庭有子女，無子女之家庭無快活。試覜男女結婚後，其第一職務，即在產生子女，以傳宗接代；故惟子女之愛，可使其父母鞠躬業瘁，殫精竭慮，以冀其子女將來之成功，母之愛子如生命，父之愛子如珍寶，故惟子女，乃為男女間愛情之結晶。謀快樂家庭者，孰不思强健之子女，而冀早作人父。然仍有若干人，於靑年時，放蕩無忌，殆喪失生育能力，始知其非，奈悔之晚矣，每見無子女之夫婦，常多歸罪於女子，其實不生育之一半，直接間接，咎在男子；或因其疾病，或因其先天之殘缺，其餘一半咎在女子，要言之，男子最喜荒淫，故不育之主因，要以性機能裏弱，早洩陰痿，及早年曾染淋毒，難會把淋病極力治好，然其生殖機能已斵傷而衰弱。除此之外，如男子之房事過度，或身體衰竭，致生成之精子，無活動力，亦不能受孕，是故凡有此種毛病的男子，在結婚前，必先恢復其健康，然後定結婚與吾，夫如斯，則幾多之家庭慘劇可免，無謂之離婚亦必減少。</p>
<p>丈夫旣息此種性弱毛病，則生育自屬無望，依余多年來治療木症的經騐所知，德國出品之眞正動物睪丸精質製　男用「補體康」確有充分之療效，凡病後體虧及神經衰弱，早洩陰痿，婚後不妊，均可治愈之。余曾在臨床上對一百四十五例之性弱不妊患者加以實騐，特分用各種內分泌製劑，經三星期後，在上述諸患者中之大部分，其生殖機能增强程度異乎微弱，而在「補體康」治療之一組，則患者顯示精血之平均增加，計每日有百分之二又四分之一，易言之「補體康」已証明優於尋常各種補劑所含之補血生精成分近二十倍，而優於其他同樣腺質製劑者近十倍，試問市上再有何種以生殖腺號招之製劑可以與之一較短長乎？此誠腎虧乏嗣之無上福音，其女用「補體康」功能調經種子，乏嗣之家庭而咎在女子者，可以服此。</p>

<h3>與淋菌最後決鬭</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>「大不敵小」此話究竟是怎樣說的？我們的答案是以小至不能用肉眼看出的細菌。我們人類七尺之軀，往往死於此用渺小得用顯微鏡才看得出的細菌之毒爪。以淋病而言，則淋病患者，每年喪生于此雙球菌之毒爪下旣不知凡幾。而每年受淋毒之害而殘廢者，又不知凡幾。如此橫行凶暴之淋菌。截至目下為止，眞不知有多少。自有人類以來，即有淋病，而人類亦自有生以來，即與淋菌相搏戰以迄今朝，其故責為科學未臻發達，所以人類尚未脫離其毒爪與饞吻。</p>
<p>現在與淋菌最後決鬭之時期到了。因為現在已有德國彼德博士發明之「克淋儂」一藥，是根治新舊淋病惟一之特效藥，因「克淋儂」具有超人理想之抗淋殺菌力。即「克淋儂」所以成功為淋病內服藥中之特效藥，高踞首座之根據。因「克淋儂」殺菌力不拘於一處，而洋溢全身，以之扑減流竄性之淋菌，可謂極其對症的療法，與不般化學療法，透膜殺菌療法，只知局部之殺菌，以及檀香油製劑只知强制收斂尿道炎症，而副作用甚大者，實不可同日而語。據瑞士希密斯傳士說，在其平生所經騐之各種藥品，求其殺菌之强大前透徹者，實以「克淋儂」為首選，舉凡一切化學療法透膜殺菌療法，等品，皆可揚棄。其推崇「克淋儂』功效之卓越，可見一斑。</p>
<h3>春季之肺病</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺病在春季常易性慾亢進，故在攝養上稍一不愼，易陷危篤，故息者在此季節，允宜格外淸心寡慾，對於輕病患者，不妨作郊外散步，多懾富有滋養食品，余歷年經騐所得，並可用「補肺拿爾」一藥，以鎭咳化痰，滅除癆菌，能如此多方留意，極力治療，不論任何頑固肺病，無不指日回春。</p>
<h3>最合理的遺精療法</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭霆</p>
<p>自十七世紀以來，科學日倡，人類舊傳統及思想上之束縛，解放無遺，而兩性關係，益形解放，靑年因女色之引誘，早已成為習慣，由是性病叢生，就中允以遣精為甚，因環境之需要，全歐之性病專家，無不孜孜研究，爭欲發明理想之性病特效藥；雖迭遭失敗，不無虛耗可貴之時聞與腦力，然先哲有言，失敗乃成功之母，最後終於由德國性病學大師耐而斯傳士，發明內分泌製劑「耐而斯遺精片」，經國家及醫學家私立醫院與專科醫師，作長期之試騐，結果証明「耐而斯遺精片」有鞏固精關，制上遺精之功用，以余三十年來之經騐，每年歐美新問世之遣精藥，其多有如過江之鯽；但有效者不多，因此性病專家，對於層出不窮之遣精藥，亦有莫知適從之苦，然自有「耐而斯遺精片」一藥發明之後，此種難題，業己解決矣。</p>
<p>最近有患者者陳變年者，因發育時期犯手淫之惡習，婚後房事不舉，遺精頻繁，雖服各藥絕少效果，余乃囑其內服「補體康」，同時服「耐而斯遺精片」。結果三星期全愈。</p>

<h3>淋巴管炎之後患—横痃</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋巴管炎L.　Ympbagitis一症，在急性淋毒性尿炎時，尤其在最急性時，而伴發陰莖淋巴管炎者，往往而有。蓋淋菌一物，直接侵入該管內而起，此症可以將Nobl增殖，與內皮Lntinaenothelien之上附有分泌物可以證明。</p>
<p>且淋巴管炎之炎症，偶然亦有波鼠蹊淋巴腺者，此爲淋毒性横痃Tripperbebo，比之軟性下疳的横痃，則經過較爲緩慢而少疼痛。化膿之事亦少。其有化膿者，普通多由於連鎖狀球菌，或葡萄狀球菌之混合傳染而起。但偶然在純培養形之横痃膿中，亦有發見淋菌之事者。</p>
<p>淋疾性横痃化膿時，外科的療法固屬必要，然宜安静，而局部療法則應中止，更施以醋酸礬土水濕布，温罨法，及蛋白療法，則恒能遏止其化膿。對於內服藥中，則「克淋儂」一，最爲適當，因爲惟有用「克淋儂」始能將其深入之淋菌，　以有力之掃滅，否則，那許多藥淋菌，不免仍有循老路。混入别的淋巴管的可能，則此症勢必更陷入困境，是不可不注意的。此外電療方面，對於德國静電療法，也是不可少的。自余臨床數十年來，對於此等形形色色的淋病變症也不知治愈了多少，而其目下一般拘執局部療法，化學療法，透膜殺菌療法，絶對不能治好淋巴管炎與其變症——淋毒性横痃　診時上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角。</p>

<h3>建設義渡及購買大橋</h3>
<p>（見遜清同洽十一年五月份本報）</p>
<p>昨工部局議事，關於黃浦大橋一節，撥將上下兩木橋，及未成之鐵橋，皆向橋主貿回，計共　價銀四萬兩，限一月內交付淸楚。因工部局建設之義渡，已告完成。（查義渡雖以擺淸為名，而其制度實為浮橋；蓋皆不用小船趁搭，以免擁擠之虞。所費銀為一萬二千之數。）將來過大橋者，必至减少，橋主有鑒及此，於是以四萬金出售云。過大橋須納費，不但不便，且不應當，木報已屢屢論之；自今而後，可以往來自如矣。</p>
<h3>子鬻母奇聞</h3>
<p>西門有婦某氏，十六歲嫁，十八歲生子，越載夫亡。家貧。婦誓不改適，以女紅為度活之計。今歲婦年三十有七，而子亦弱冠矣。惟其子性嗜博，輒勸不改。今月，共子往烟館遇某乙，因喪偶，未續絃。其子即佯謂「同居有一少婦，喪所天，家貧，屢思別抱琵琶，顧此婦不輕見人，惟常過舍，汝如欲見，請來訪我。」某乙從之，誤認其母即所述之婦也。甚合意。越數日，付聘金二十元，的日迎娶。其人謂共母曰：「今有某乙，欲偕兒前往別埠，傭於共店，所得銀洋，將由該家轉遞，請同往某乙家中一行，認識門徑，以便時相往來。」其母大喜，與之偕往，至半途，因行綏，其子詭謂某乙不能久待，請乘輿先往，至則彼家賓客滿堂，正待新娘來也。互相質詢，方知受欺，現巳訴之於官矣。</p>

<h3>關於「十不運動」的幾句話</h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>偶然披閱報章，看到下面這樣一段消息：「本埠中國學生服務社，籌備慶祝五四靑年節，決定於是日發起學生十不運動：（一）不進跳舞塲；（二）不讀有害書：（三）不做電影迷；（四）不着外國衣；（五）不買外國貨；（六）不寫戀愛信；（七）不跳黃浦江；（八）不愛出風頭；（九）不受人利用；（十）不作亡國奴。」</p>
<p>大哉！「十不」！美哉！「十不」！</p>
<p>「五四」是我們民族復與史中一個重要的時期，從這之後，的確孕育了一些關於民族爭生存國家爭自由的轟轟烈烈的偉蹟。我們回顧過去五四運動重大的意義，應該如何的激勵來茲！</p>
<p>上海素來是文化中心點，卽因戰事而淪為「孤島」，要不失為文化樞機上策動的重要的一環，這一點，誰也明白的。因此，對於上海的靑年學子羣，更不能不有求全的責備</p>
<p>「十不」，是上海靑年學子的「十不」；是上海靑年學生每個人不能不服膺的「十不」，現階段的民族，現階段的國家，允其是現階段的上海靑年學子，少不得這一回重新估量自己的檢討工作。</p>
<p>跳舞，淫書，電影，洋服，洋貨，談情說愛，沽騷獵艷，自殺，風頭狂，近水樓臺的奴化工作，那一件不是日夜侵襲於上海靑年學子的周遭；有一件上身，就可以斷送他們寶貴的前程，國家民族的元氣，坐令斵喪，千載而下，必有詬病此時此地此人。何况都市誘惑的機會太多，物質的激刺加倍强烈，而精神的渙散，每下愈况，這是有識之士所以寒心而謀有以拯救之也。</p>
<p>在民族國家艱難困苦之秋，責任最大的是靑年學子，允其在上海方面，特別應該對於自己日常生活，提出來檢討一回，而且對於「十不」要下了決心宣警實行，居常在各該「十不」上加了「有沒有做到…」這五個字，而自己切切實實的自問良心，有無愧作之處。</p>
<p>有沒有做到不進跳舞場？有沒有做到不讀有害書？有沒有做到不做電影迷？有沒有做到不着外國貨？有沒有做到不寫戀愛信？有沒有做到不跳黃浦江?有沒有做到不愛出風頭？有沒有做到不受人利用？有沒有做到不作亡國奴？</p>
<h3>「一學徒」來函　希望創辦函授學校</h3>
<p>— （編者）</p>
<p>上月二十六日本刋發表：「滬東公社開辦學徒夜校四所」一文後，接到署名「一學徒」的來信，聲述在半舊式商店中的學徙，根本沒有自由，因之有大好求學的機會，失之交臂。同時希望關懷學徒教育者，在可能範圍中，創辦免費函授學校，使他們能忙裏偷閒讀一點書。</p>
<p>從這封信中，我們可以看到學徒們求知慾的區切，卽使沒有「自由」去讀義務夜校，也希望「忙裹偷閒」，能够自修。我想滬上像滬東公社那樣的機關，如果可能，一定能够接受這個懇切的要求的。不過，接到了這封信後，我有點意見想說一說，就是一般的舊式商店，實在太剝奪了學徒們的」一文中，作者曾這樣說：「學徒教育的促進，不但有關學徒自己的前途，而且也可帮助商業的改進。」即使自私一點，老　們也不應連晚上七時至九時這兩個鐘點內，不許學徒們去讀一點書，所以，我以創辦函授學校的問題倒還在其次，滬東公社的「派調查員五十人，分赴各區商店，調查學徒的教育程度，並懇求經理或店主允許他們的學徒求學」，確是當務之急哩。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　含悲茹苦淚灑四廂　崇儉習勞體勤十畝</p>
<p>吳君素知道今晚有幾位姊妹要來，預先關照了厨房，預定了坐位。但是別人也有呼朋邀友，預先定了的，公共餐室今日平添了一倍的人。不過倘然眞是擠不下，也司以送到各人宿舍裏去吃的。好在他們只是便飯，並不是請什麼客，比較平時的飯菜，多添幾樣能了。他們吃完了飯，便要到學校中的劇塲裹去看戲，都是很忽忽的。其實戲劇的開塲，是要到九點鐘　開幕，何必老早就要去呢？原來在戲劇開幕之前，還要開映幾卷新聞，短片的電影。這些新聞電影，都是最新的出品，大半是中央電影局所橇取　。中國這一兩年來，電影事業，突飛猛進。因為大家知道電影不是專供娛樂用的，而對於宣傳的作用更大。就是對於學業上，也有很大的帮助。所以吾國新攝的新聞片，着實不少。為的是明年一千九百五十二年，美國紐的又要開一個世界博覽會了。這個世界博覽會，規模很大。其中有一個電影院，可以牧容觀衆三四萬人。開映的片子，收羅全世界的名片，以及科學新聞片子。這電影院是自朝至暮，終日不斷地開映的，大概每一張片子，只能開映一次，還怕到博覽會閉幕的時候，來不及映完咧。因為美國近來不但是電影，就是電視事業，也極發達。中國最近攝了不少的新聞片，也是預備趕緊送往紐的世界博覽會去的。因為博覽會是全世界人都要去的，也可以使全世界的人，明瞭中國戰後新興氣象。使全世界的人，知道中國的概况，雖經過消樣長時期的戰爭，而恢復力極大。不但僅董是恢復戰前景家，而且要突過以前的一切，不再是一個吳下阿蒙呢。還有一件事，要報告讀者諸君的，就是那世界運動會，不是每隔四年，舉行一决嗎？明年一千九百五十二年，父逢着舉行世界運動會的一年。而明年的世界運勸會，父決定在中國舉行。中國已經在首都不遠，指定了一處地方，建築了起來了。到那時，世界各國的人，就要來得不少，中國也就要然閙一番。不過美國紐約的世界博覽會，開在春季，而吾國的世界運動會，却開在秋季咧。　（一○○）</p>
<p>生活報告</p>
<h3>女侍應生</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>我－一個為了家境而輟學的女子，自應上海職業指導所女侍應生考試，而僥倖在數百應試者中錄取後，又在該所代辦的女侍應生訓練班修讀實習了三個星期，經發給修業證書，便在常熟山景園供職，到現在巳逾兩個月了。</p>
<p>我們大都是初中程度，一共是三十位，但屢經剔除不稱職的，到現在巳不滿此數了。我們的工作是相當的繁重的，分早晚兩班，互相輪流，早班規定晨七時（冬日八時）到店，即在簽名簿上報到，更換制服後，就開始工作。由兩人擔任三四間房間的遞菜等侍應職務，或是在小吃部裏工作。到午後一點鐘才達休息時間，工作由晚班接替。在這時間中，僅茶室營業，所以祇有四五位女侍應生擔任侍應工作，而早班的女侍應生就可在休息室裏休息，或是閱讀園方所置的申報，新聞報，健康家庭等報章雜誌，或是假寐片刻，養息精神。至鐘鳴五下，那時早晚兩班便須共同工作，到晚上十一時顧客盡散後，才停止工作，各自回家。</p>
<p>平日園方雖沒有規定經常的休假日期，但是每月可請假一天，並不扣薪，以資休息。如果在一月中並未請假過，那就可獲得獎勵性的額外增加一天的薪金。園方並儲備獎勵金，每年發給工作勤當的女侍應生；並聘請了大衆醫藥顧問，用以保障我們的健康，費用由園方跟我們各擔負一半（每年每人二元）。</p>
<p>上海職業指導所對於它所訓練出來的女侍應生，非常重視，以為這是婦女界的新職業，所以常常遺派辦事人員來跟我們談話，聽取我們的意見，而向園方督促改進，就是主任潘仰堯先生，也常來指導我們</p>
<p>我們工作最大的阻礙，便是深深留在人們腦際裏的「咖啡女」一侍女一等的惡印象。於是往往使顧客以輕浮的態度對付我們，有時打趣的稱我們一女堂倌一，有時竟毫無廉恥的呌我們「妹妹」，這眞太可惡了，太可恨了。我們對付這種顧客，便祗有置之不理了。所以現在在每間房間貼出兩條　「侍應生的工作是高尚的」和「尊重自己的人格一的標語。但是像上面的　客當然是極少數的，大多數都是態度和藹，認為由勞力而獲得酬報確是最高尚的職業的。</p>
<h3>日本經濟的犯罪病態</h3>
<p>— 无</p>
<p>崩潰是病的結果，病在腠理的時候，是常人的眼光看不到的，不過病日加深，病態便逐漸表現出來，我們預料日本的主旨，對華的戰爭，要「速戰速決」，一持久了，便有經濟崩潰的禍患。自從蘆溝橋發難以來，將近兩年了，究竟日本的經濟到什麼地步，就日本報紙的紀載看來，大藏大臣演說最近募的公債八十一億，只有五億可以把捐稅來抵補，其餘要把日本人民的儲蓄金來充用，那儲蓄金是國民的膏血，拿國民的膏血來變成藥彈，那是最後的一着，去經濟崩潰不遠了。</p>
<p>還有日本實施經濟統制規定而後，已經一年了，他們國民的認識不深，所以違反的越發衆多，據牠司法省刑事局的調查，去年六月起至本年二月止，全國違反的有一萬三千五百八十一人，其中起訴的，東京五百七十九人，大阪五百十人，此外有三千一百五十人，最近累犯者有漸决增加的傾向，司法省當局以為這是誤於向持的溫情主義，應該改變方法，而對於違反者採嚴罰主義，數日前松本刑事局長，發指令給全國各檢事局說，嗣後處分這種案件，酌量案情的狀况，而處以體刑與罰金刑，但以罰金為主，任何法令，犯的人太多了，那法令的效力也將等於零。日本經濟的崩潰，究竟在什麼時候？照上述的情形看來，怕是不很遠了嗎？</p>
<p>且說在華的日本人，假借勢力，發他國難財的，實在不少。或借軍部的護照運輸物品，或勾結一般奸商，經營那不明不白的商業，這種墮落的怪象，從前在日本國裏，却是不看見，不聽聞的，現在這種事實，不但耳聞，並且目見，日本民族性的墮落，國家社會公共經濟要崩潰，可從這民族性的病態中看出來了。</p>

<h3>大導演威廉凱萊夫婦　二十小時游上海</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>好萊塢名導演威廉凱萊與夫人琴納弗托萍蜜月放行過滬的消息，巳群見四月廿二日本刋。果然這兩位藝人於昨天上午十一時到港，記者於傍晚時分偕施衡元君和他倆會見，回來便拉雜寫篇短文，以饗讀者。</p>
<p>來去匆匆</p>
<p>凱萊伉伉儷這决是蜜月旅行，但他倆結婚已將近一年了。從好萊塢啟程，第一個經過的國家便是日本，輸决橫濱，即到東京，而居留的時間，不過兩整天，便原輪來滬了。昨午登陸後，寄寓國際飯店四〇一號，華納影片公司駐滬人員熱烈招待，午後一時許他倆偕華人某君憑弔閘北戰蹠，四時許回至南京路辦些中國貨物，五時半纔回寓所，那時他預的五時談話的中外記者二十餘人，已鵠候良久了。七時應華納當局之宴，八時赴黃金大戲院後台看章遏雲化妝，再臨前台聽戲，－雁門關；十一時游百樂門。大都會。麗都三舞廳，好萊塢之游作罷；十二時後安息，今晨六時乘美艦巡船趕上日本皇后輪赴港；換乘飛機往內地一游，目的地他不會發表，大的是雲南四川吧？至多留一星期，再往西貢新加坡，然後赴歐洲各國，的七月初回紐的，這是他的行程，他在滬僅留二十小時，眞是來去匆匆了。</p>
<p>游日印象</p>
<p>凱萊夫婦被新聞記者包圍了！和他說幾句眞不容易，我們問他游日的一般印象，而他說話很謹愼，隨處避重就輕，仔細看我們的臉，說道：「這裏有日本記者沒有？」答「沒有！」纔放心說，我倆到東京，首决和日本報界見面，他們第一句就問我好萊塢影星拒穿日本絲襪有道事麼？我只好說這還不很淸楚……。我曾參觀各影片公司，覺得設備很不錯，古裝片的服裝很美，不過時裝片太差了，我不以為然，其他不願多說。</p>
<p>憑弔戰蹠</p>
<p>凱萊旱就決定憑弔上海戰跡，可見非常關心中日之載，昨天費了三小時光陰，遙望閘北江灣市中心一帶焦土抗戰的遺跡，他不發表什麼感想、不過詞氣之間，很有悲憫慨歎兼有同情的樣子；允其是經過某　境，眼看無數雖民被侵略者搜查時一劇猙獰的面目，很覺悽慘，正想攝入鏡頭，而被嚴囑制止，深為遺憾！</p>
<p>愛好國劇</p>
<p>他因爲時間很經濟，我們不便多發言，只隨便問了三點：（一）先生過去所導演的影片，以何者為最滿意？（二）這决返美，將有佝新片攝製？（三）對中國電影與戲劇的觀應？……他答語頗簡單，（一）那到不論影片的性質，但視劇本的好壞而定，像「乞丐皇帝」我自己比較滿意些，因為那主角　兄弟都很好。（二）返美後導濱什麼片，此時未能預定。（三）我對梅蘭芳的戲劇很有與趣，記得在美時曾看過他的戲，感覺所配的音樂服裝與表情都好，可惜不甚明瞭，此行匆匆，未能參觀中國的攝影塲，引為憾事！他父說以前會識中國字四十餘，現在只記得「人」字和「田」字了，相與一笑。談至此大家握手告別，左圖即其夫婦及親筆簽字。</p>
<h3>蘇聯彩色革命片　「女壯士」開映</h3>
<p>蘇聯第一部有聲鉅片「生路」，在中國，雖然不能說家喻戶曉，但是看過蘇聯影片的人，沒有個不知道它的偉大的但是很遣　，我們看過了一生路之後，多年來却沒有再見到原導演愛克的其他作品。原來愛克氏在蘇聯影片工業中担負了一個很嚴重的任務：他完成了蘇聯第一部有聲片「生路」－給蘇聯影業奠了有聲的技術基礎之後，他又肩負了另外一個重任－製作有色影片，給蘇聯影業奠立彩色片的技術基礎。這第一部彩色片便是即將在「滬光」開映的「女壯士」。</p>
<p>我們只知道愛克是一個好導演，但從這艱巨的任務來看，我們又可以知道他是一個高明的技術專家。但從「女壯士」一片來看，我們又知道，愛克並且還是一個編劇家，一個演員（他在片中主演了一個角色）。</p>
<p>「女壯士」是草創的五彩片，但在技術上，並不亞於美國片。「女壯士」是用「夜鶯曲」貫串全片一部描寫俄國革命前夜可歌可泣的女工革命鬥爭。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>民國後伶人身價抬高的原因</p>
<p>遜淸末年的時候，雖說是戲劇盛極一時，然而社會上對於伶人歧視的心理，却是很普遍的。例如伶人子弟不得應試，外界人羞與伶人子女議婚，甚至尚有「娼俊隸卒」相提並論的這些流行語。同時伶界中有一種設私坊，立堂號，教授子弟侑酒的惡習，而這種風尚又不僅僅限於旦角一行，就連鼎鼎大名的譚鑫培，尚有英秀堂之剏立，所以孫菊仙常好抓着他這個把柄，每向外界人說道；「鑫培的名氣雖大，可惜他總有私坊出身的習氣，」譚子小培有一年也同不佞說過：「現在有許多報界人每逢提到我們老爺子，總好用譚英秀三字代表他的名字，其實那簡直同罵我們的一樣。因為「英秀」兩子，是當時私坊盛行時所立的堂號名，不料有些不明事理的人，竞拿它富作我們老爺子的別號了，豈不可笑。」再者說，像姑見人時，照例須先請安為命之坐，始敢就座，因此無形中就有些不平等的習慣。所以在遜淸時伶人的身價總是很低落的。後來幸虧有田際雲孫菊仙兩人，再三反對私坊制度，極力主張取銷，以為劇界爭人格，故而伶人侑酒的惡習，也就漸漸消滅於無形了。以上所述，乃伶人本身先有所覺悟，經田孫諸伶界先進自動整飭其內部的情形。入民國後，復經軍閥政客及參衆兩院議員，組織捧角團體，時與名伶往還，不但唱角所得之包銀，較前陡增，同時其在社會上之地位，亦日益增高。茲特舉其事實之較為顯著者數端，藉證北伐前軍閥政客熱烈捧角之一斑。</p>
<p>（一）皖督倪嗣冲專車邀全體名伶蒞蚌為其太夫人祝嘏　民國初年，倪嗣冲以皖督地位移住津浦要術的蚌埠，當時倪氏為其太夫人誕辰，曾派專人，並備專車北上舊京，聘請全體名伶南下，生角計有孫派鼻祖孫菊仙，劉派鼻祖劉鴻聲，汪派傳人王鳳卿，譚派傳人余叔岩，武生泰斗楊小樓；旦角為靑衣泰斗陳德霖，及名旦王瑤卿，梅蘭芳，尚小雲等，老旦泰斗龔雲甫；凈角為第一武凈錢金福，第一銅錘裘桂仙等，丑角為第一各丑王長林；餘如朱素雲，九陣風，亦為小生及武旦行之第一流名角。專車抵蚌時，倪氏並派督署軍樂隊赴站歡迎，在遜淸時代，外任督撫大員，從未有如此盛大堂會之先例，在倪氏為此破天荒之舉，如此優遇伶人，固矚罕見之事，然而伶人身價之提高，亦為破題兒第一遭也。（一）</p>

<h3>Daily Military Reinforcements by Japanese Troops, Prelude to Major Battle in Central Hubei Begins; Japanese Troops Attempting to Cross Han River Driven Back to East Bank by Chinese Forces; Fierce Fighting Rages East of Suixian and Southwest of Zhongxiang; Four Japanese Planes Self-Destruct at Nanchang Changjiao Front</h3>
<p>Yicheng:  The major battle in central Hubei has now begun. The bloodiest fighting is taking place east of Suixian, along the Ping-Han railway. Two to three thousand Japanese troops, using the Xi River as a starting point, are attacking in two directions: west and north, towards the Senlin Temple, Sunjiazhai, and Jiuxingzhai areas northeast of the Hua Zhe River. One morning, the Japanese troops launched a fierce artillery bombardment of Senlin Temple, and about eight to nine hundred infantry and cavalry, under the cover of artillery fire, approached the Chinese positions. The Chinese defending troops bravely engaged the Japanese in close combat. Fierce fighting continued until noon, resulting in over six hundred Japanese casualties. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforced their troops and used poison gas attacks, but the Chinese troops continued to resist with all their might, causing the Japanese to suffer over a hundred more casualties. By this point, the Chinese forces had also suffered two-thirds casualties. As of the evening of the second day, the Chinese troops were still engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops in the vicinity of Senlin Temple. On the Sunjiazhai and Jiuxingzhai fronts, the Japanese troops used four cannons to bombard the Chinese positions. At the same time, five to six hundred Japanese troops attacked. The Chinese troops then engaged them in a bloody battle. As a result, due to their weaker forces, Sunjiazhai and Jiuxingzhai fell into Japanese hands, but the Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses. On the Zhongxiang front, over a thousand Japanese troops attacked north from Yangzi on the second day, making contact with a certain Chinese unit and engaging in fierce fighting. Currently, the Chinese troops hold the upper hand. (Second Day Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a report from the Chinese military today, the Japanese counter-offensive in Nanchang has been completely repelled by the Chinese forces. The Chinese troops near Nanchang have already begun to launch a fierce offensive against the Japanese garrison, with the intention of completely occupying Nanchang. A new unit of the Chinese army has begun to advance towards Lehua, north of Nanchang, with the aim of encircling the Japanese troops attempting to prevent the Chinese advance. Fierce fighting is taking place in Xincun (transliterated) and Wanshe, southwest of Nanchang. Chinese troops advancing west towards Guangyang Bridge (transliterated), five miles east of Nanchang, have already reached the outskirts of Nanchang, but have not yet entered the city. Yesterday morning, four Japanese planes participated in the battle, attempting to repel the Chinese troops. However, due to poor visibility, they mistakenly bombed Japanese units outside Nanchang city. Although the Japanese have reinforced their troops by three thousand in the Fengxin area, they have still been unable to break through the Chinese defense lines between Gaoan and Fengxin. According to a spokesman for the Chinese army here, the Japanese plan to advance on Changsha has completely failed. The Chinese counter-offensive on Nanchang has greatly hindered the Japanese plan to advance on Changsha after occupying Nanchang. The Japanese authorities had concentrated the strength of four divisions in order to advance along four routes: the Yuehan Railway, the Gaoan Highway, Wuning, and Wuchang. It is reported that the Japanese troops are currently concentrated in the vicinity of Yingshan, Maping, and Zhongxiang. It is expected that a fierce battle will soon take place in central Hubei. As of now, the Japanese attempt to cross the Han River in Zhongxiang has still failed. The Japanese are now concentrating a large number of cannons, as well as some tanks and armored vehicles, in the vicinity, and it is expected that they will attempt to cross the river again soon. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in Jiangjiahe (transliterated), on the other side of the Han River, and a unit of Japanese troops has moved north towards Sunjiazhai. At the Erdaogou airfield in eastern Hubei, fifteen Japanese planes were destroyed on the ground in a surprise attack by Chinese planes.

<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Chinese army held a press conference here this afternoon to comment on the Chinese army's offensive in April. No large-scale offensive was launched anywhere. The Chinese army's offensive has been completely successful in this regard. The Chinese army's counter-offensive on Nanchang has caused the Japanese to fail in their original plan to launch a major offensive on Changsha. The fighting southeast of Nanchang is still ongoing. Chinese troops in northern Hubei are putting pressure on the northern flank of the Japanese troops on the east bank of the Han River, preventing the Japanese troops from crossing the Han River and advancing west towards Shashi and Yichang.

<h3>After the Recovery of Heshan, the Situation in the West River Has Become Stable; Fierce Fighting in Xinhui and Jiangmen</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) External reports indicate that several Japanese motorboats have been spotted near Zhongshan, causing the atmosphere to become tense. However, Japanese troops in Shiqi and Beitanzhou have been repelled, and the remaining Japanese troops in Danshuikou and Gongyibu have been wiped out. Recently, due to the frequent increase of Japanese troops in Foshan, Sanshui, and Hekou, the Guangxi army took the lead in marching east to launch a fierce attack in order to kill the Japanese momentum. Fierce fighting is still taking place in Jiangmen and Xinhui. The Japanese have no strength to launch another southward offensive. At the same time, due to the strong counter-offensive by the Chinese army, the Japanese conspiracy to attack Shantou will definitely not be realized. Ningyang Road, Daze, Siqian, Doushan and other places were wildly bombed by Japanese planes on the first day. Lehui County in eastern Hainan was also bombed into scorched earth.

Fortunately, a certain Chinese commander directed the soldiers and embraced the determination to sink the boats and break the cauldrons, and launched a fierce counter-attack. As of today, Heshan County Shaping to Xinhui County have been recovered by the Chinese army. A small number of Japanese troops in the suburbs of Xinhui are also holding dangerous passes, covering the large troops retreating to Jiangmen. In addition, because the Chinese army cut off the highway between Jiangmen and Guangzhou, the Japanese army was afraid that they would not be able to retreat by land, and prepared a large number of motorboats and rubber boats at Haimenzui on the Jiangmen side of Xinhui in an attempt to escape across the sea. At present, the situation in the West River has stabilized (Second Day Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Waste of Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Loving peace and valuing promises are the habits of civilized society; therefore, the factual lessons of violence and the loss of credit are numerous; after years of repeated adversities, although we are also heartbroken; but longing for peace, longing for the possibility of promises, those who yearn for and pursue them are still countless. US President Roosevelt telegraphed German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on April 15. Calling for world peace and requesting guarantees for 30 countries is a representative work of habits that have not disappeared. When Hitler delivered a speech on the 28th, at the same time, the Japanese side had an informal expression of not intending to participate in the German-Italian military alliance. In the past five or six days, the general mood seemed a little calmer; even the discussions from all sides were still unanimous in the crisis, and the tense situation had not improved, but I was secretly happy that the door to diplomacy had not been closed. Saying that peace is not guaranteed, saying that promises are not credible, let alone no promises; but is the so-called diplomacy not necessarily based on peace and promises? If the foundation is not established, even if the door of diplomacy is wide open, what good is it?</p>
<p>The response of the ruling and opposition parties in Europe and the United States to Hitler's speech has been very relaxed; judging by common sense, the relaxation on the surface is the beginning of a different internal brewing, and it will never end with relaxation. Just in terms of the current situation: although the United Kingdom does not give up its organization of the anti-aggression group and the implementation of the conscription system, it happily takes the part of Hitler's expression of goodwill to the United Kingdom as a topic for cabinet meetings; and Hitler's saying of mutual guarantee is also regarded as a way that may be worth trying. The tripartite alliance of Britain, France and the Soviet Union has frequently reported good progress, but the grace of advance and retreat still maintains a peaceful atmosphere, like a prosperous age, and is not a plan for emergency response. Hitler alone did not understand Poland, so the most tense reaction seems to be limited to Poland alone. As for the United States, it is planning to enact the second equation according to Mr. Xi's saying, and move it to the normal diplomatic track, thinking that mutual guarantees will also have answers to be sought, and it does not want to give up the opportunity lightly. The attitude revealed by the various countries to Japan is that since the anti-communist agreement has not been changed to a military alliance, Europe and the United States have no worries about the East; newspapers in London and Paris regard this as an important factor in the current situation; it is said that this "is of great benefit to maintaining peace, and can have a significant impact on British-Japanese relations, and open a path for economic cooperation between the two countries."</p>
<p>From our perspective, the key to how the international situation will tend to go is not here at all. Taking Europe as an example: Germany's theory can be answered by history and geography textbooks in elementary and middle schools, and it is what makes European and American politicians speechless. They said that they have never invaded, this is theoretically based on natural desires and living space, and in fact, it is proved by the fact that various countries have answered that they have not been threatened. Based on their arguments, they can choose the most favorable historical fragment of the Germanic nation at any time to promote it. If you have ever threatened to ask various countries, you don't have to ask the dead Austria and Czechoslovakia, and you don't have to ask Lithuania, which sent away Memel, and Poland, which is trying to preserve Danzig. Even on the issue of Czechoslovakia, after inciting the inner river, it was protected by accepting the request. This form can be blamed for non-aggression. And if the German-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement had any value before April 28, it is a question, but once unilaterally declared abandoned, what can England and Poland do? Therefore, even if Germany follows Mr. Roosevelt's proposal and gives a guarantee to every country; even if, as the general public expects, it enters the door of diplomacy and concludes agreements with each of them; but who can guarantee that it will never be abandoned at any time? Who can guarantee that it will never incite the introduction of wolves into the house by ethnic minorities? Moreover, as far as the Far East is concerned: does Japan's association with Germany and Italy depend on a covenant? It only depends on Japan's strength, and it only depends on the opportunities given to Japan by all parties; when the opportunity is given and the strength is reached, action follows, why wait for the covenant? Is the occupation of the New South Islands not an example? In short, aggressive action is the product of aggressive policy. Aggressive policy depends on aggressive tools for transfer; to pray for peace to aggressors today, or to be privately gratified by the aggressors' temporary non-expansion of aggression, will eventually leave remorse. Those who seek to settle the international order are not in consulting the opinions of the aggressors, nor in spying on the attitude of the aggressors. The key is to take effective measures to stop aggression; apart from this, no matter the energy, time, language or words, they are all wasted.</p>
<p>National Spiritual Mobilization Begins</p>
<h3>General Chiang Kai-shek Encourages Compatriots to Fulfill the Responsibility of Atoning for Humiliation and Seeking Revenge</h3>
<p>"May First" Speech Broadcast Nationwide; 100,000 People in Chongqing Participate in Civic Assembly; Torch Parade Held After the Meeting</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The monthly civic assembly will begin tonight to respond to the National Spiritual Mobilization movement. An estimated 100,000 people will participate, respectfully listening to General Chiang Kai-shek's speech, followed by a torch parade through the major streets of the city. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) General Chiang Kai-shek delivered a nationwide radio address at 8 PM on May 1st. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots, today is the anniversary of the nationwide implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization, the diligent practice of national duties, and the beginning of National Monthly Assemblies. The representatives from all walks of life holding this inaugural ceremony here are not performing a mere formality; it is truly the most painful and yet</p>
<p>most meaningful</p>
<p>era-defining day for our nation's revival. Moreover, today is Labor Day. I, Chiang, want to express my personal expectations to all compatriots across the country. At the same time, I want to take this opportunity to solemnly awaken a collective effort among our compatriots trapped under the enemy's tyrannical oppression. Our entire nation is now at a critical juncture of survival, where victory or defeat hangs in the balance. The 22 months of war have already clearly indicated the promising prospect of victory. However, the stubborn and brutal enemy is still trying to exert its bestial nature to the fullest extent and intensifying efforts to</p>
<p>conquer us.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not have the slightest bit of laxity or negligence. We must intensify our efforts and struggle because our final victory will come from our strong resistance and unwavering belief in victory. Starting from today, we must thoroughly examine our own spiritual shortcomings. Starting from today, we must spiritually eliminate the old and embrace the new, reform and renew ourselves, making a groundbreaking effort. We must treat our past shortcomings as if they died yesterday, and embrace our future spirit as if it were born today, conducting this arduous and severe war with a renewed spirit. Today's ceremony is equivalent to a rally for the National Spiritual Mobilization, a declaration of the National Spiritual Mobilization. We must swear to our ancestors, the Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor, and to the spirit of our Founding Father in Heaven, that starting from today, we will thoroughly</p>
<p>fulfill the National Covenant,</p>
<p>wipe away the various shortcomings of fearing difficulties, enjoying ease, being complacent, and seeking temporary peace, and fulfill our responsibilities to the nation and to our forefathers. We must swear to the soldiers and compatriots who have sacrificed themselves since the war of resistance began that starting from today, we will redouble our efforts to avenge them, to atone for the nation's humiliation, and to continue the path of our predecessors' blood. Today marks the first day of May. Throughout this month, one after another, are arranged many national humiliation anniversaries commemorating the enemy's aggression against us. We are truly shocked and in immense pain. Every</p>
<p>descendant of the Yellow Emperor</p>
<p>of the Chinese nation must resolve today to turn the month of national humiliation into a month of atonement. Speaking of this, I want to first express my infinite concern for our compatriots in the occupied territories, especially our compatriots in North China, our compatriots in the Northeast, and all compatriots along the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Beining, Zhengtai, Jiaoji, PingSui, PingHan, Yuehan, Guangjiu, Jinpu, Longhai railway lines, and in other occupied territories. Especially our elders, although I cannot often meet and speak with you, my spirit is constantly connected with your will. I think of your suffering every day as you live in the tragic situation of occupation. You are eagerly awaiting</p>
<p>the good news of our army's victory,</p>
<p>and your eyes are fixed on the recovery of our homeland. I constantly worry about you. Your perseverance, your death-defying struggles, and your efforts to preserve the integrity of the Chinese nation under the enemy's iron-fisted violence move and delight me even more than news of victory from the front lines every time I hear of you killing one enemy or burning one batch of enemy goods. Because your actions in the enemy's rear, within our occupied territories, have a greater impact than killing a hundred enemies on the front lines. Therefore, as long as our compatriots in the occupied areas can</p>
<p>resist the enemy</p>
<p>and strike at the enemy spiritually, and refuse to cooperate with the enemy, it is as meritorious as our soldiers fighting on the front lines. Our officers and soldiers on the front lines not only miss your hardships in the occupied areas but also deeply appreciate your spirit of perseverance and struggle. What do our government officials and soldiers never forget? It is to live up to your expectations, so we must continue to strive, never slackening, to come to your aid without fail and to</p>
<p>liberate you.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must resist for a long time, regardless of any sacrifice. Today we are holding the National Spiritual Mobilization. I want to first extend my greetings to all of you, elders, sisters-in-law, brothers, and sisters. I know that no matter how dangerous or difficult the situation, you will definitely accept this movement and implement it. We are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor. War can only temporarily isolate our physical contact, but it cannot sever the exchange of our patriotic conscience and our blood ties. At this time, if among our citizens there are still those who are</p>
<p>living in a drunken stupor,</p>
<p>those who are seeking temporary comfort, those who are selfish, those who are of divided will, and those who do not know how to strive and strengthen themselves, then they are not compatriots of the Chinese nation, nor are they descendants of the Yellow Emperor. I now hope that all of you, our compatriots residing far in the rear, such as in the concessions of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou, and our overseas compatriots in Hong Kong and other places, especially our young men, must remember the hatred and humiliation of your country. You must be independent and self-reliant in spirit, and cherish yourselves in life, be responsible, and know shame. Because I have heard reports from Chinese and foreign individuals from Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou that our youth in the concessions are still dancing, wandering around, and</p>
<p>not cherishing themselves.</p>
<p>I am deeply grieved to hear this. You should all know that you are the distressed, troubled, orphaned sons of a nation under enemy oppression. Therefore, you must be diligent and frugal, endure hardship and toil, take labor as your duty, and make service your goal. No matter where or when, you must be independent and self-reliant and never be belittled by the enemy. Instead, you should be respected by friendly nations. If they see that our young citizens can all understand morality, know shame, have ambition, have a sense of national pride, are industrious, and are thrifty, then they will surely have infinite hope for the future of our country and will be able to enhance the dignity of our nation. This is why we must first have our</p>
<p>compatriots, both men and women,</p>
<p>unanimously implement the tenets of the National Spiritual Mobilization and diligently practice the oath of national duties, which are: (1) Do not betray the Three Principles of the People; (2) Do not violate government laws and regulations; (3) Do not violate the interests of the nation and the people; (4) Do not be a traitor or a submissive subject of the enemy; (5) Do not participate in traitorous organizations; (6) Do not be an officer or soldier of the enemy or traitors; (7) Do not guide the enemy or traitors; (8) Do not spy for the enemy or traitors; (9) Do not work for the enemy or traitors; (10) Do not use the banknotes of enemy or traitorous puppet banks; (11) Do not buy enemy goods; (12) Do not sell grain or any goods to the enemy or traitors. In this way,</p>
<p>arm yourselves spiritually,</p>
<p>do not be threatened by the enemy's violence, do not be tempted by the enemy's interests, and show our independence, self-reliance, fearlessness in the face of danger, and uncompromising integrity in the face of adversity, so that the enemy will be even more afraid and will not dare to belittle or oppress us. In short, at this critical juncture of the war of resistance, we, whether on the front lines, in the rear, or in any location in the occupied territories, must implement the National Spiritual Mobilization and diligently practice national duties, which is to thoroughly implement</p>
<p>the new life movement of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame.</p>
<p>Starting from today, everyone must make this resolution, to be worthy of being an independent and self-reliant citizen. Compatriots, you must also know that the National Spiritual Mobilization movement cannot be effective with just five minutes of enthusiasm. We must persevere and be strong for a long time. Therefore, we must be consistent and unwavering. The purpose of the spiritual mobilization is not only to encourage each of us to struggle diligently today but also to create a new life for our country and</p>
<p>a new spirit</p>
<p>through sustained refinement. We must constantly examine ourselves, temper ourselves, spur ourselves on. Tang Zhi Pan's inscription says, "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so every day. Let there be daily renovation." We must have this awareness and determination to renovate daily, constantly innovate, constantly strive, and constantly strengthen our manpower and material resources to break the enemy's brutal and wanton aggression and realize our great Three Principles of the People. Fellow compatriots, you should know that today's National Spiritual Mobilization and National Covenant are our invisible guns and</p>
<p>supreme aircraft bombs.</p>
<p>In other words, this spiritual mobilization and National Covenant are also the greatest weapons of the war of resistance, and the organization of our National Monthly Assembly is the spiritual fortress of our people's war of resistance. Therefore, we must thoroughly implement it and maintain it continuously. The effect of this diligent practice will surely be more valuable and more powerful than any steel and cement fortress. Therefore, after the National Monthly Assembly begins, we must not</p>
<p>follow the old ways</p>
<p>as we did in the past. We must eliminate the old bad habit of perfunctory performance and instead follow the guidelines and regulations and earnestly practice them. It must be known that the National Monthly Assembly is our spiritual innovation, the morning bell that awakens us. Today, the enemy invades our China, committing all kinds of atrocities everywhere, treating the Chinese people worse than livestock. This humiliation is</p>
<p>more painful than the death of a father.</p>
<p>Each of us should constantly ask ourselves, "Have you forgotten the great hatred of the enemy invading your country and slaughtering your compatriots? Have you forgotten the shame of seizing your land, bombing your houses, killing your sons and brothers, and defiling your mothers, daughters, and sisters?" If we can constantly warn, encourage, and exhort ourselves in this way, we will naturally not engage in such drunken dreams, complacent comfort-seeking, and reckless behavior. We must further think about our fifty years of</p>
<p>extraordinary humiliation,</p>
<p>immense suffering, and profound pain, which will surely inspire everyone to make a new start and strive to achieve the goal of revenge, atonement, resistance, and national salvation. Starting today, after the National Monthly Assembly begins, I not only hope that everyone can sincerely take the lead in practicing it but also sincerely encourage and supervise each other. We must create a new atmosphere, with the backbone of society setting an example and taking responsibility for advocating it, while also supervising each other, correcting mistakes and encouraging good deeds, and encouraging each other. Today, if each of us is concerned with</p>
<p>self-cultivation,</p>
<p>it is also saving the nation. We must recognize that if one compatriot or one colleague cannot implement the spiritual mobilization, it is a disgrace to our entire nation. We must hold a public-spirited and enthusiastic heart, not only be responsible for ourselves and abide by discipline, but also encourage each other from father to son and from superior to subordinate, and jointly supervise and promote it. We must rigorously implement assessment, supervision, mutual encouragement, and observation, and universally promote our Chinese nation's inherent</p>
<p>noble and great</p>
<p>spirit. I hope that from now on, the country will universally develop a new atmosphere of revival. When we look at the difficult founding times of past dynasties, there was always a spirit of hard work, resilience, and vigorous enterprise, and a spirit of worry and vigilance. If this spirit does not decline, the country will not perish no matter what happens. Consider the end of the Jin Dynasty, the Five Dynasties, and the late Song and Ming dynasties, when the court and the public were chaotic, with a drunken and dreamy, selfish, and self-interested atmosphere, and an empty, scattered, divided, and chaotic situation. We must constantly think of</p>
<p>the lessons of the rise and fall of past dynasties,</p>
<p>recall the hardships of our ancestors' founding, and be determined to strive and work hard to fulfill the responsibility of atoning for humiliation and seeking revenge. We must all be painfully aware that the national crisis of this period is entirely the result of our generation's indulgence, degeneration, and lack of ambition. If our generation cannot seek revenge and atone for humiliation, we will truly have no way to face our ancestors above or our descendants below. Today, there are actually a small number of</p>
<p>traitors and degenerates</p>
<p>and those with weak will and lost spirits who are engaging in shameless acts of national betrayal. This is truly a disgrace and misfortune to our country. But every ambitious and patriotic descendant of the Yellow Emperor must be determined to be utterly loyal to the country and to the nation, which is to be loyal to responsibility, loyal to duty, loyal to laws, and loyal to discipline, to fulfill our inescapable mission of resisting aggression and building the nation. Our country's</p>
<p>eternal rise and fall</p>
<p>and its honor and disgrace for thousands of years will depend on whether we can thoroughly implement the tenets of the National Spiritual Mobilization in this once-in-a-lifetime revolutionary era, whether we can diligently implement the regulations of the National Covenant, and whether we can earnestly implement the guidelines for resisting aggression and building the nation. If we can all implement these, then we will surely be able to unite our spirits under the great goals of "nation above all, people above all, military first, victory first, concentration of will, and concentration of power" to crush the enemy's policy of aggression, realize our Three Principles of the People, and complete our great cause of revolution and nation-building. Fellow compatriots, goodbye." (Dispatch of the 1st)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Demands England and France Form a Three-Power Military Alliance; Anti-Aggression Group Limited to Europe; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Proceeding in a Spirit of Excitement; Anglo-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty Practically Completed</h3>
<p>(London) The Soviet Union today indicated that unless England expresses agreement on the matter of a three-power military alliance, it will no longer continue negotiations. Thus, the attempt to invite the Soviet Union to join the peace front will reach a stalemate. According to the Soviet Union's intention, it plans to conclude a military alliance with England and France. It is widely believed that if England is unwilling to comply with the Soviet Union's demands, the Soviet Union will strive to organize an anti-aggression group within the Baltic countries. As for the English side, it is sincerely feared that the expansion of the Anglo-French agreement may force Japan to accept Hitler's suggestion to change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that neither England nor the Soviet Union touched upon the Far East during their talks. This talk was purely limited to Europe. It is said that English policy aims to strengthen the general power of anti-aggression and is contacting the Soviet Union with this plan. At the same time, it is taking into consideration the opinions of countries such as Poland and Romania. England wishes to substantively deny Germany's claim that England intends to encircle it. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, Soviet Ambassador to England Maisky, after returning to his post from Moscow, has had a lengthy and very friendly talk with English Foreign Secretary Halifax. The dates that have been reported for the completion of Anglo-Soviet negotiations are purely speculative. The conversation discussed the entire state of negotiations in all aspects and considered the opinions of other countries regarding joining the anti-aggression plan. Official circles are unwilling to make any statements regarding the content of Anglo-Soviet negotiations but say that they are currently proceeding in a spirit of excitement and hope. It is rumored that Ambassador Conrad, stationed in Poland, did not discuss the issue of England's guarantee applying to Poland when he met with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. The two sides only exchanged their views on Hitler's speech and agreed to pay attention to Hitler's remarks regarding Poland and Danzig. Responsible sources believe that the issue of England's guarantee to Poland is already very clear, and no incident has occurred that would cause this guarantee to change in any way. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that what the cabinet discussed today was mainly the negotiations being conducted by England with Turkey and the Soviet Union. The speech previously delivered by German leader Hitler, in the view of the English government, actually failed to provide any new factors, and no changes have occurred in the international situation as a result. Therefore, it was decided to implement the original policy. According to sources close to the government, Turkish Ambassador Rushti visited the foreign affairs authorities today, and the Anglo-Turkish alliance treaty has, in fact, already been completed. However, the government authorities must wait until negotiations with the Soviet Union and Bulgaria have ended before formally issuing a declaration. Regarding Bulgaria, England's intention is that even if the country does not join the Balkan Entente, it should at least maintain friendly neutrality during wartime. Regarding the Soviet Union, England advocates that England, France, and the Soviet Union form a mutual assistance agreement to jointly guarantee the countries neighboring the Soviet Union to the west. It is expected that the Soviet Union will submit its answer in the shortest possible time. However, the mutual assistance guarantees provided by England and France will not extend to the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border. Regarding this point, diplomatic circles recently declared that the reason Japan firmly rejected the proposal to change the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance treaty is precisely because England and France did not agree to guarantee the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) According to sources in political circles here, Anglo-Turkish negotiations have completely ended, and the results are as follows: (1) Turkey agrees to the Soviet Union joining the guaranteed public mechanism; (2) England guarantees that if Turkey is attacked by Italy, England will come to its aid; (3) Turkey also guarantees that if Italy attacks Palestine and Egypt, Turkey will provide rear support to England; (4) Turkey allows the English fleet to pass through the Tatar Strait during wartime. However, the above news has not yet been officially confirmed. (Haitong dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Turkey Consult on Organizing a Black Sea Peace Group</h3>
<p>Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Jiji Active; Seeking to Resolve the Romanian-Bulgarian Case First</p>
<p>Ankara: The Turkish President and the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs yesterday discussed a proposal to organize a Black Sea peace group to cooperate with the European English-French anti-aggression front. It is said that the Black Sea group plan aims to obtain a guarantee that once war occurs, the Tartar Dardanelles Strait should be publicly permitted to allow the warships of countries opposing European aggression to enter and exit freely. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) The "Peace Front" planned by the Soviet Union and Turkey is rumored to be completed here today. English and French leaders hope that the results of recent consultations in London, Paris, Moscow, Warsaw, and Istanbul can form a group containing twenty countries to resist the aggression of the National Socialist Party and the Fascists. England, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Turkey are the main members of the group. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Diplomatic activities here have been very noteworthy recently. President Ismet Inonu yesterday separately received Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin, French Ambassador Massigli, and former French Army Chief of Staff General Weygand. He also arrived here from Iran this morning, all wishing to make preparations for the establishment of a Black Sea agreement between the four countries of the Soviet Union, Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The establishment of this agreement is expected to require the rapprochement of the two countries of Bulgaria and Romania and to find a way to resolve the pending issue of the Southern Dobruja province. (This province belonged to Bulgaria before the Second Balkan War and was assigned to Romania after the war.) Regarding this, the Turkish government is said to have warned Bulgaria that if Bulgaria infringes upon Romania, it will deploy troops to intervene. At the same time, it is also advising Romanian officials to make territorial concessions as a way to appease the situation. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu also discussed this when he visited France recently. The French government fully agrees with Turkey's views. Potemkin will also travel to the two countries of Bulgaria and Romania when he returns to his country in the coming days, which is also related to this matter. If the two countries of Bulgaria and Romania do establish an agreement, then Bulgaria will join the Balkan Entente, making this Entente a tool to defend against the expansion of Germany and Italy to Southern Europe. After the establishment of the Black Sea agreement, Romania and the Soviet Union will easily approach each other. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Poland and Lithuania Completely Resolve Old Grievances; Lithuanian Army Commander-in-Chief To Be Invited to Visit Warsaw</h3>
<p>Warsaw: At Poland's invitation, Lithuanian Army Commander-in-Chief Raštikis will officially visit Warsaw in mid-May, staying for three days. It is widely believed that the Lithuanian Commander-in-Chief's subsequent talks will have special importance because Poland and Lithuania, who were mutually hostile a year ago, have now completely resolved their previous grievances and hope to seek cooperation. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Poland Decides to Reject Germany's Demands</h3>
<p>Heavily Armed Troops Stationed on the Danzig Border; European War Imminent</p>
<p>(New York) Polish Ambassador to the United States Potocki, having received instructions from Warsaw, issued a statement here last night saying that Poland will resist any attempt by Germany to seize Danzig. To demonstrate Poland's firm position against Hitler's demands for Danzig and the Polish Corridor, the ambassador said that regarding this matter, there is probably no room for reconciliation between Germany and Poland. At the same time, he revealed that when Polish Foreign Minister Beck responds to Hitler's demands in parliament on Friday, he will make counter-demands to Germany. However, he declined to reveal the nature of Beck's future counter-demands to Germany. (Associated Press dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Reports regarding Poland maintaining and increasing its military defenses on its border, especially in the Polish Corridor and Danzig, were officially confirmed yesterday. The third of this month is a national holiday here. Since all troops have been deployed to the border, the parade on that day will be carried out by the Warsaw Guard. According to the announcement, Polish troops will not participate in the parade because they have other tasks. At the same time, over 100,000 Poles watched the Polish Air Force conduct exercises over twelve major cities. The reaction here to Germany's demands for Danzig and the Polish Corridor can be seen in the slogans posted everywhere. These placards say, "This is our reply to Hitler." (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Warsaw: After the Polish government issued a partial mobilization order and issued air force bonds, Poland has presented a wartime psychology throughout the country. Newspaper commentaries say that the war crisis is imminent, and the statements of Polish political leaders are adding fuel to the fire. Agriculture Minister Poniatowski said in a nationwide radio address yesterday that the time has come for Poland to defend its territory and rights by force, and the people must be prepared to fight at any time. National Party Chairman Gwahlborsky also said in a speech to the party yesterday that war may be unavoidable. (Haitong dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>If Danzig Is Subject to a Maritime Attack, Retaliation Will Mark the Beginning of a Major War</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The attitude of the Polish newspapers towards the Danzig issue in recent days has led well-informed sources to believe that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's speech in parliament in the coming days will be a serious rejection of Germany's demands for the city of Danzig. "Gute Zeitung" reported that if Danzig is subject to a maritime attack, it cannot but be retaliated. The first sound of this retaliation will be the signal for the start of a major European war. (Haitong dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>English Navy Vice Admiral Henderson Dies</h3>
<p>Served as Captain of the Flagship Stationed in China</p>
<p>(London) Navy Vice Admiral Sir Henderson passed away here today at the age of fifty-seven. Henderson served as the captain of the flagship "Hawkins" and chief of staff to the commander-in-chief of the British fleet stationed in China from 1919 to 1921. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Completes Plan to Threaten Britain: Troops Land on South Coast of Wales; England Can Be Subdued in Four Months</h3>
<p>Greenwich: The "Thames Seven News" reported today that Germany has completed its plan for a surprise landing of troops on the south coast of Kent and Wales. If this landing plan is successfully implemented, Germany can conquer Britain in four months. (May 2nd, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>British Government Announces: Conscription Bill</h3>
<p>This system also applies to Northern Ireland; the term of validity is tentatively set at three years.</p>
<p>(London) The Conscription Bill, officially known as the Military Training Bill, and the Auxiliary Forces Bill, have been released in full tonight and will be passed by Parliament as soon as possible. The second reading of the Military Training Bill is scheduled for May 4th, at which time Prime Minister Chamberlain will make a speech. The effective period of both bills is three years, and they can be extended by one year by order of the cabinet after three years, or repealed before three years. (May 1st, Reuters)</p>
<p>Military Training Bill: Eight Key Points</p>
<p>(1) Male subjects of the empire residing in the United Kingdom, between the ages of twenty and twenty-one, shall apply to the Ministry of Labor for registration and undergo a physical examination by a doctor. Upon receipt of the notice of passing the examination, they shall enlist for training within ten days for a period of six months. Upon completion of the training period, they shall be assigned to the auxiliary team or reserve team for three and a half years of service. (2) When necessary, the navy and air force may select a portion of the recruits undergoing training to be trained in the auxiliary teams of the navy and air force. (3) An order may be issued, when necessary, to extend the conscription system to Northern Ireland. However, it is generally believed that the King will not issue such an order unless there is an emergency or war has actually occurred. Regarding this matter, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland will come to London tomorrow to thoroughly discuss it with Prime Minister Chamberlain. (4) Irish youths regularly residing in the United Kingdom shall also participate in military training, as with other dominion citizens regularly residing in the United Kingdom, but those temporarily traveling are not included. (5) All youths nationwide who are over the age of seventeen and have already joined the military, or who voluntarily joined the army auxiliary team before April 27th of this year, or who are currently studying at a military academy, will not participate in military training. (6) Those who have "conscientious objections" (i.e., those who do not wish to join the military) may submit an application, stating the reasons, to the local court for review. If they are dissatisfied with the court's decision, they may appeal. However, even if this application is approved, they shall still perform work for the country, the importance of which shall be the same as military service. (7) Any youth nationwide who is twenty years old and fails to register or state his reasons shall be fined five pounds and ordered to complete registration. (8) Employers shall re-employ all youths nationwide who temporarily abandon their original jobs due to enlisting for training after the training period expires, and those who violate this rule shall be punished. (May 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>Simplifying Reserve Team Call-up</p>
<p>The Reserve Team and Auxiliary Team Bill was also announced today, authorizing the Navy, Army, and Air Force to summon reserve team and auxiliary team members when necessary to prepare for national defense, based on cabinet orders. This bill also has provisions to protect the reinstatement of conscripts, similar to the Military Training Bill. (May 2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>The main goal of this bill is to simplify the procedure for summoning regular army reserve and national guard troops. According to the current procedure, the King must issue a decree to Parliament, ordering it to pass a resolution authorizing the government to summon reserve or national guard troops for enlistment, and this decree must be posted nationwide before the competent authorities separately notify those who should enlist. If Parliament is in recess, a special session must be convened. This is considered too slow. Therefore, the government has decided to propose a new bill, proposing that the King issue an order when necessary, authorizing the Navy, Army, and Air Force to summon all or part of the reserve and auxiliary teams to serve. This procedure has long been commonly used by various countries. Once Britain adopts it, it will be able to act more quickly in responding to external crises in the future. (May 1st, Havas)</p>
<h3>German Army Commander-in-Chief Inspects North Africa</h3>
<p>Rome: General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, flew to Tripoli today at the invitation of the Governor-General of Italian Libya to inspect military installations in North Africa. He is scheduled to stay for five days, accompanied by General Pariani, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army. (May 1st, Haitong)</p>
<h3>Under Foreign Trampling: The Czech Spirit Is Not Dead</h3>
<p>Resistance spirit is expressed everywhere; Czechs abroad are determined to restore their country.</p>
<p>Prague: Since Bohemia and Moravia came under German "protection," the Czech nation's sense of national identity has not disappeared. Resistance to German rule is expressed everywhere, with resistance in culture and language being the most intense. The Czech language has now become a sacred language among the people. Each movie theater projects the definitions of words from large dictionaries daily to facilitate popular education. The books purchased and read by the public are mostly works from the Austro-Hungarian Empire era depicting the Czech people's resistance to imperial rule. The plays performed in theaters are all in the genre of advocating freedom, but the German authorities have banned many patriotic plays. In the city of Police (close to the German border), someone initiated the construction of a theater dedicated to performing Czech plays. Upon hearing the news, all the residents of the city enthusiastically supported it. A construction company donated 100,000 square bricks. Most people are willing to volunteer their labor. Wealthy families provide their trucks and motorcycles for workers to ride. In addition, Czechs, regardless of wealth, are now advocating wearing national costumes. On the 20th of this month, German troops held a military parade at the sports field here to celebrate the anniversary of their leader's fifth decade of life, but few people watched. Three-quarters of the seats in the entire field were empty. By the afternoon, however, the statue of national hero Jan Hus was surrounded by a dense crowd. According to a report from the Ceteka news agency, many residents of Pilsen had poured hydrochloric acid on German soldiers. Fifty Czechs and fifty Jews were arrested, and the city was fined as a warning. Economically, Bohemia, Moravia, and even the Slovak state have been significantly affected since being controlled by Germany. Meat, chicken, eggs, fats, and butter are extremely scarce. Coffee is lacking, and tea has disappeared. There are few goods left in clothing stores. It is even difficult to buy handkerchiefs in Bratislava. According to the exchange rate stipulated by the German authorities, one mark should be equivalent to ten Czech crowns. A barber in a certain town in Slovakia recently gave a haircut to a German soldier. After the soldier paid with one mark, the barber, according to the legal exchange rate, gave him the change, but when he took it to the bank to exchange it, he only got eight crowns and two *heller* (Czech subsidiary currency). Not only did the barber decide to give free haircuts to German soldiers, but he also lost thirty heller. So he posted a notice in front of his door, which read, "Free haircuts are given here to German soldiers, only a small tip is enough," which also shows the extent of German exploitation. (April 30th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Czech and Slovak residents in France held a conference here this afternoon and passed the following resolution: "The Czechoslovak state is currently under violent trampling. All actions are not recognized by our two nations. We shall join with compatriots residing in other countries, rise up and fight, and not allow our motherland to fall into ruin. If war breaks out in Europe, our two nations residing in France are prepared to cooperate with France and its allies to fight, in order to fulfill our patriotic duty." In addition, former Czechoslovak President Beneš sent a telegram from the United States, stating that Czechs and Slovaks residing in the United States are determined not to be slaves to other countries and will organize a unified group to work tirelessly to ensure that a free Czechoslovak state reappears in a free Europe. The conference immediately sent a reply telegram, asking him to lead the Czech and Slovak people to fight together to restore freedom and rights. (April 30th, Havas)</p>
<h3>US Neutrality Law: Cash-and-Carry Clause Expires; Amendment Issue Remains Politically Heated</h3>
<p>(Washington) The second article of the current Neutrality Act, namely the cash purchase and own transport clause, expired at midnight today. From now on, once the President declares that a state of war exists between two or several countries, the Neutrality Act only has the clause prohibiting the transportation of munitions to the belligerent countries, which can be implemented. The "New York Herald Tribune," a Republican newspaper, recently commented, "The expiration of the cash purchase and own transport clause does not mean that Congress intends to abandon any principles or ideas on which the Neutrality Act is based. The reason is that members of Congress have fierce disputes on several points when discussing the international situation, and they have not been able to reach a consensus by the time this clause expired. Currently, what members of Congress should consider are still the following two viewpoints: If American security is not threatened and there is no need to resort to war, members of Congress are willing to prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war. Secondly, when war breaks out in Europe, the vast majority of American public opinion is willing to substantially assist Britain and France to confront the German-Italian axis. So far, none of the amendments proposed by the members can reconcile these viewpoints. Only the one proposed by Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (proposing to extend the cash purchase and own transport clause to all kinds of munitions) can be regarded as a compromise and is supported by the majority of Congress members."

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has urged Congress to allocate a sum of $2,000,000,000 for the national defense plan. He also requested an immediate allocation of $276,000,000 for military aircraft and defense facilities in Panama. The President requested a sum of $206,502,500 for the development of the air force and the construction of the Panama Canal defenses. In addition, $70,497,500 is for paying for military aircraft contracts that have been signed, and another $185,000,000 is allocated for the purchase of military aircraft, salaries, and equipment. With the exception of $50,000,000 that has already been passed, the additional funds can increase the US air power to 6,000 aircraft in the near future. (May 2nd, Associated Press)</p>

<p>Various Countries Celebrate Labor Day</p>
<h3>Moscow's Red Square: Grand Parade Held; 700 Military Aircraft Soar Through the Sky; 1.8 Million People Participate in the Parade</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Today is International Labor Day. Stalin inspected the navy, army, and air force in Red Square as usual. There were 20,000 participants, including cadets from military academies, sailors from Leningrad, the "Labor Division," infantry, border guard soldiers, cavalry, armored vehicles, tank units, anti-aircraft battalions, and anti-aircraft artillery units, led by General Budyonny, commander of the Moscow military district. They paraded past Stalin and People's Commissar of Defense Marshal Voroshilov. At that time, 700 fighter and bomber aircraft flew in formation overhead, including nine new-style bombers, painted red, followed by a giant four-engine bomber and three fighter aircraft, all newly built model aircraft, which flew past at extremely high speeds, dazzling onlookers. (May 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>This demonstration involved 1.8 million people, expressing an extremely high level of patriotism. In addition to this city, according to reports received, grand military parades and demonstrations were held throughout the Soviet Union today. (May 1st, TASS)</p>
<p>This civilian parade did not shout slogans against other countries, nor did it express criticisms of British Prime Minister Chamberlain as in the past. (May 1st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Voroshilov Issues Warning: Determined to Strike Aggressors</h3>
<p>(Moscow) During the May Day military parade, Defense Commissar Voroshilov delivered a speech, saying:</p>
<p>"In today's international situation, bourgeois rulers are everywhere engaging in base and cowardly tricks such as bloodshed, intimidation, and conspiracy. The working masses of the world and all honest people in capitalist countries should further recognize that the Soviet Union is the only country where the government and the people are united in fighting to the end for universal peace. Only the Soviet Union, from its establishment to the present, has consistently opposed war and opposed all conspirators of massacre, fighting for true peace and ethnic unity. Except for those who are disadvantaged, the world knows that the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is a true force defending peace. The Soviet Union's armed forces are indeed powerful, but they never threaten anyone unless those who dare to invade our country's borders, these people will have no good end; they will be annihilated.</p>
<p>"The second imperialist war provoked by fascism is now threatening the whole world, making all working masses and honest people deeply hate it. To resist this madness of aggression, and to stop the second world-level massacre, and eliminate its destructive influence, there is only one true force. The Soviet people have long felt the hatred and abomination of the aggressors' violent and bloody actions against all nations and countries. The Communist Party and the government had long foreseen the inevitable occurrence of all recent events, and immediately created a powerful Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, whose responsibility is to defend the Soviet Union's land and people, property and honor.</p>
<p>"Our people have deep confidence in their future, believing that the Red Army will be able to guarantee their peaceful labor, knowing that no intimidator can threaten them with small military adventures, and knowing that they are fully prepared for large-scale war. Our people love peace, value its price, and strive for universal peace. But our people can also fight and welcome the fight. If the mad aggressor forces our people to take up arms against the enemy, our people will fight to the death. The enthusiasm and sophistication will be equal to the situation seventeen years ago when they defeated the enemy and are now building a socialist life. They will never stop until they achieve complete and thorough victory.</p>
<p>"The Red Army is an invincible force, but it is still the vanguard of our country's immense army. This army is the great Soviet people, and this people's army is invincible from ancient times to the present." (May 1st, TASS)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, a grand military parade was held here, and Yang Jie, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and the military attaché of the Army, all attended.</p>
<h3>Moscow Broadcasts: Chongqing Can Be Heard Clearly</h3>
<p>Moscow: Today, a broadcast speech was made to China, expressing admiration for China's war of resistance. The broadcasts from Moscow to Chongqing, including speeches by leaders and all the circumstances of the celebrations, can be heard clearly here. (May 1st)</p>
<h3>Third International Issues Proclamation: Calls on Democratic Front to Aid Invaded Countries</h3>
<p>(Moscow) May 1st is International Labor Day. The Third International recently issued a letter to workers around the world, stating that the governments of Britain, France, and the United States should provide China with munitions and credit loans and should also aid the Spanish Republicans, as well as the people of the Czech Republic, Albania, Abyssinia, and Austria, so that they can break free from foreign control. The victories obtained by various dictatorships are due to the anti-Soviet appeasement policy promoted by the reactionaries in Britain and France. At this moment, it is urgent to hold an international workers' conference, and workers' organizations from various countries should form a united front based on collective security to resist fascist aggression and maintain peace. Regarding this matter, the Second International (i.e., the Socialist International) and the International Federation of Trade Unions (also belonging to Socialism) should negotiate with the Third International and the Communist Trade Union International.

<h3>Zhu Xuefan Delivers Speech in America on China's War of Resistance</h3>
<p>(Washington) Zhu Xuefan, the labor representative from China attending the International Labor Conference, delivered a speech to 500,000 workers at the May Day celebration today, stating that China is fighting for world peace and democracy. China's war is America's war, and China's victory is America's victory. But the United States actually supplies China's enemies with lethal weapons to slaughter Chinese women and children. Therefore, the United States is truly in need of immediately banning the supply of munitions to Japan and intensifying the boycott of Japanese goods. (May 1st)</p>
<h3>Hitler Speech: Encourages Youth to Maintain Sound Thinking and Be Guards of the Country</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany held a grand May Day celebration today. Male and female members of the Hitler Youth gathered at the Olympic Stadium near Berlin. As usual, Führer Hitler personally delivered a speech. The venue was magnificently decorated, with a total of 132,000 attendees, including youth delegations from Italy and Hungary, as well as Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki, Foreign Minister Csáky, and Italian Roman Governor Prince Colonna, who are currently visiting. German Youth Leader Schirach presided over the meeting, forcefully arguing that the realization of Greater Germany in recent years has been entirely due to Führer Hitler. After Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a brief speech, Hitler delivered a speech, outlining the successful progress of Greater Germany in the six years since 1933, claiming that "a country with no defensive capabilities six years ago has today become one of the most heavily armed countries in the world." Its own strength and the friendship of other countries are sufficient to guarantee its safety. This achievement is entirely due to national unity and should be attributed to National Socialism. Hitler then encouraged the youth of the country, saying, "The future responsibility of the nation lies entirely on your two shoulders. I and the advanced members of the National Socialist Party hope that you will become strong and upright German men in the future, who can be trusted by German women and who can be the guards of the country. You must maintain the health of your bodies and minds. There are some countries that do not want to see a unified country and do not want the German people to enjoy the rights enjoyed by other nations. If one day these countries want to harm Germany's freedom, then I trust that you will issue a huge "voice of protest" to make all countries realize that the possibility of dividing the German nation is now a thing of the past."

<h3>French Workers Work as Usual on Exceptional Holiday</h3>
<p>Paris: Today is May Day. The cities and towns in the various provinces of France began celebrating last night.

The Paris May Day celebrations were held in the Bois de Vincennes. An estimated 150,000 people attended. Participants shouted slogans such as "Social Justice," "Guarantee Freedom," and "Maintain Peace" and then dispersed. Secretary-General of the Paris Association Renard delivered a speech, stating, "The current international situation is indeed tense. Although French workers hope for peace, if they lose their freedom and independence, French workers will come out to defend themselves and serve the country." (May 1st, Haitong)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Kokumin Shimbun reports that the Japanese government has warned the British government, expressing extreme concern over rumors circulating that cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union will extend to the Far East. The Japanese ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, was instructed to visit British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax on April 27 to deliver this warning. It is said that Lord Halifax replied that Britain would never accept any commitment to take joint action with the Soviet Union in the Far East. Shigemitsu then claimed that Britain's policy of aiding Chiang Kai-shek was equivalent to acting in concert with the Soviet Union in the Far East and that the British government should immediately terminate this policy. Lord Halifax replied that Britain had never pursued such a policy and that the British government did not recognize the need for any change in its current policy in China. The Kokumin Shimbun then added commentary, stating that Lord Halifax's words indicated that Britain intended to continue aiding Chiang Kai-shek, therefore it was necessary for Japan to adopt a stronger diplomatic attitude towards Britain.

<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers continue to launch major attacks on Britain and Russia. It is claimed that British personnel in Hong Kong have been training Chinese air force officers and soldiers, while the Soviet Union has sent thirty military advisors to Xinjiang to assist the Chinese army.

<p>(Washington) Attention here is focused on whether Japan will militarily join the German-Italian bloc to contend with Britain. It is generally believed that if Japan joins the German-Italian military axis, the line-up of the democratic bloc will inevitably expand further, but it is hoped that these two blocs can avoid becoming acutely antagonistic for the time being.

<p>(Tokyo) Here, various Japanese circles are criticizing the proposal put forward by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to authorize the US President to restrict trade with Japan due to Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty, arguing that if this bill is passed, the result will inevitably be that the United States will change its fair attitude and violate the spirit of its Neutrality Act. Japan has never violated the fundamental principle of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Open Door Policy. Apart from restrictions implemented due to wartime military strategy, Japan has no intention of discriminating against the nationals of third countries in China. The opening of Qingdao port at the expense of Japan's military strategic interests is one example. Since March, Japan has been working to find a peaceful solution, under conditions that do not impede Japan's military activities, to outstanding issues with third countries concerning China. Pittman's decision to propose an anti-Japanese bill is intended to use this bill to cover up his biased and unfair actions when amending the Neutrality Act due to appeals from China.

<h3>Japan's Attempt to Dominate East Asia - Hiranuma Utters More Delusional Ramblings</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma, speaking today at the National Prefectural Governors' Conference, expressed deep gratitude to Germany and Italy for their sympathetic understanding and willingness to provide assistance to Japan, in their capacity as signatories to the Anti-Comintern Pact since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, stating that the signatories to the Anti-Comintern Pact have a real need to seek closer cooperation. Japan's immediate task is to seek a satisfactory resolution to the China Incident. Japan's basic policy on this matter has long been determined and has been announced from time to time. Hiranuma reiterated Japan's determination to build a "New Order in East Asia," with the aim of establishing lasting stability in East Asia, and stated that cooperation between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" in political, economic, and cultural fields is a necessary condition for Japan to smoothly accomplish this mission. Japan is willing for China to reconsider its anti-Japanese attitude and assume its responsibility for building the New Order in East Asia. At the same time, Japan hopes that third countries will understand Japan's policies and objectives and actively participate in the construction of the New Order in East Asia in terms of commerce, finance, and technology. The Prime Minister, when relaying internal affairs, solemnly declared the necessity of consolidating national defense to cope with the subtle international situation. Since the China Incident has entered a stage of long-term construction and reconstruction, this necessity is even more evident. The Prime Minister also advocated cultivating economic resources and promoting overseas trade, stating that the Japanese government is determined to invoke the National Mobilization Act to invest all of Japan's resources in the Sino-Japanese War in order to achieve its ultimate goals. Hiranuma concluded by saying that, in view of the seriousness of the situation, he believes that the entire nation must unite their efforts to serve the country. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry today issued an informal opinion on Hitler's speech at a gathering of news reporters, stating that since Britain and the United States cannot implement the principles of the Open Door and Equal Opportunity in all parts of the world, they should adopt a policy of non-interference in the Far East. We greatly approve of Hitler's clear rejection of Britain and the United States' right to interfere in international disputes. Britain and the United States, not only invoke the principles of the Open Door and Equal Opportunity to claim the right to interfere in Japan's efforts to build a New Order in East Asia and establish peace in East Asia, but also act as arbitrators between China and Japan. What Japan wants is "Asia for Asians." Japan does not oppose the principles of the Open Door and Equal Opportunity, but believes that Britain and the United States should first implement these principles throughout the world before applying them to the Far East.

<h3>Severe Earthquake in Akita Prefecture, Japan</h3>
<p>Over a Thousand Houses Destroyed - A Small Village Submerged</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A strong earthquake occurred last night in Akita Prefecture, 250 miles north of here. Transportation has been cut off, so it is impossible to know how many lives have been lost and how much material damage has occurred. However, it is known that fires have broken out in several places after the earthquake. It is said that the population of Akita City is 60,000. This earthquake was a strong up-and-down type, similar to the great earthquake that occurred in 1923. The epicenter of this earthquake was in the seabed near the Oga Peninsula. The earthquake occurred because a portion of the island's seabed subsided. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) News of the disaster caused by the earthquake that occurred in Akita Prefecture in northern Japan at 2:59 p.m. yesterday has continued to emerge since transportation was restored. According to a police report at 9:00 a.m. this morning, a total of eighteen people have died, twenty-seven have been injured, and seven are missing. Five hundred and seventy-two houses have been completely destroyed, one thousand and seven houses have been partially destroyed, and eight have been burned. The epicenter was in the Sea of Japan, 30 kilometers from the mouth of the Noshiro River in Akita Prefecture. Ogashima Island suffered the greatest damage. It is said that the village of Aikawa in Akita Prefecture, with a total of seventy houses, was submerged in the sea yesterday afternoon. Akita City suffered relatively little damage, with only two warehouses storing chemicals and pharmaceuticals being burned down. A dam in the Funakawa area collapsed, burying seven houses and leaving three residents missing. A certain village on the west bank of Lake Hachirogata suffered heavy damage, with almost all of the village's five hundred houses being destroyed and one villager dying. Another town north of that village also suffered heavy damage, with two hundred and fifty-nine houses being completely destroyed, one hundred and sixty houses being partially destroyed, four people dying, and many people being injured.

<h3>Japan's Strain Becomes Increasingly Evident - Severe Shortage of Domestic Tenant Labor - Shortage of Goods Becomes an Increasingly Serious Problem - Shortage of Iron Goods such as Agricultural Tools</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Yukio Sakurauchi met with news reporters today and admitted that many places in Japan are experiencing a shortage of agricultural labor. It is said that, in addition to the large reduction in manpower in various provinces due to the war in China, many farmers have now become workers in munitions and other factories, earning higher wages. This trend is particularly evident in villages near major cities. The authorities have decided to organize a "Labor Corps" consisting of fifty men per group, to be sent to various villages to assist in agricultural work during the busy farming season. The authorities also intend to increase the cooperation of women in agricultural affairs and to force high school and junior high school students to serve. The shortage of materials resulting from the government's control plan is an even more serious problem. With iron being controlled, agricultural tools are in short supply, and the shortage of iron nails and wire is hindering the manufacture of fruit boxes. Due to the shortage of gasoline, it is inconvenient to spread fertilizer, and motors cannot be used due to the lack of heavy oil. It is also impossible to obtain pesticides for killing pests. These obstacles must be remedied. The authorities have recently decided to cooperate with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to improve the current situation as much as possible. (Reuters)</p>
<p>(United States, Kansas) Bishop Moore, who has lived in the East for six years, spoke at the "American Methodist Episcopal Church" conference today, saying that "Japan's war against China, the money and manpower it has cost, has greatly depleted Japan's national strength. Now all the sensible Japanese are deeply worried about this, because they all understand that the crisis their country is encountering is unprecedented in Japan's recent history. They all already know that Japan's current struggle is a struggle for Japan's survival. I dare say that, if Japan continues like this, its leaders will deeply regret their mistake in using troops against China." (1st Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Under German and Italian Aggression - Turmoil in the European Situation</h3>
<p>— Wu Jingsong</p>
<p>The demise of Czechoslovakia, the annexation of Memel by Germany, and the occupation of Albania by Italy have not only made small countries in Southeastern Europe such as Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Greece, and even Turkey in the Near East, which previously advocated reconciliation with the Fascist axis, feel the danger to their independent survival, but have also made Western European democratic politicians of the likes of Chamberlain and Daladier feel the disillusionment of their good dreams and rise up to take remedial measures. This is not so much because Chamberlain and Daladier have become psychologically aware or have changed their policies, but rather because of the pressure of the environment, the demands of reality, and the attacks from public opinion that have forced them to do so.</p>
<p>At a time when the situation in Europe is becoming increasingly perilous, there are three characteristics that deserve our special attention: First, the small countries of Eastern Europe, frightened by the cruel destruction of Czechoslovakia and Albania at the bloody hands of Fascism, know the true faces of the Fascist states and have unanimously changed their previous attitude of friendliness towards the Fascist states, seeking ways to survive. We know that in 1934, Poland, seeing the wavering policies of Britain and France, made great political and economic concessions to Germany thereafter. Naturally, the countries bordering Germany or Italy would be the first to suffer from such concessions. Therefore, the then Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck immediately adopted a pro-German policy and concluded a ten-year non-aggression treaty with Germany. Germany also took advantage of this policy to weaken one of France's important satellites in Eastern Europe. Germany did not pay attention to the Polish Corridor issue, which was close at hand, but shifted its gaze to Austria and Czechoslovakia. As a result, Hitler achieved his goal of annexing Austria. After this, when Germany seized the Sudetenland region, Poland also took advantage of the fire and plundered the Teschen region from Czechoslovakia. This region had caused disputes between Poland and Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1920. Now, Poland has finally achieved its wish, which is naturally a matter of being elated and complacent. Not only that, but Poland even colluded with Hungary to plot the division of eastern Czechoslovakia in order to establish a common border with Hungary. Poland would not have dared to be so rampant in its selfish attempt without the permission of Nazi Germany. We know that Göring, Hitler's right-hand man, when he visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck last spring, suggested that Poland should annex eastern Czechoslovakia. If this goal were achieved, Hungary would inevitably be disappointed. To compensate for Hungary's losses, Hungary could occupy a part of Romanian territory as an exchange. The Nazi Party's policy towards Eastern Europe was extremely sinister. They encouraged the Polish people to deceive their ally Romania and collude with Hungary, on the one hand to make it an accomplice in the slaughter of Czechoslovakia, and on the other hand to provoke the feelings of Poland and Romania as a preparation for individual destruction.</p>
<p>As for Yugoslavia's policy towards Germany, it was actually about the same as Poland's. Before Germany annexed Austria, Yugoslavia's pro-German color was already very strong. The frequent exchanges and close political and economic cooperation between Germany and Yugoslavia have long been a well-known fact. Furthermore, since last year, the military equipment purchased from Britain by the Yugoslav army in the past has long been replaced by German military equipment. Later, Germany guaranteed that the current borders between Germany and Yugoslavia would not change, which proves that Hitler's foreign policy towards Southeastern Europe was smooth sailing and invincible.</p>
<p>However, this situation completely changed with the Nazi annexation of the entire Czech Republic, the seizure of Memel, and the preparation to recover Danzig and the Polish Corridor. Germany's seizure of Memel, as former Polish Prime Minister Sikorski said, "After Berlin seized Memel and exerted pressure on Lithuania, it is now encircling Poland from the north, and Poland is now held in the German pincer. This is a matter of extreme concern for Poland." Although the London Times correspondent reported that Poland opposed joining an anti-Nazi bloc, and although the German news agency reported that Poland would not change its previous foreign policy and would abide by the 1934 German-Polish non-aggression treaty, the Polish foreign minister's visit to Britain and the conclusion of a mutual assistance military agreement with Britain proved that Poland felt the need to form a united front with other democratic countries to safeguard its own security.</p>
<p>Just as Britain declared its guarantee of Poland's security, Italy, another axis of Fascism, echoed its old partner Hitler and launched a full-scale military operation against the small South European country of Albania, occupying the country. On the one hand, this was a demonstration to Western European countries, and on the other hand, it can also be said to be a necessary step in Fascist aggression. We know that Gayda, a spokesman for Italian Fascism, said in June last year that "Italian foreign policy has two key points, one is to focus on Africa, and the other is to focus on the Near East." He also said: "Italian diplomacy will not abandon the Balkans." The invasion of Albania is the beginning of an offensive against the Balkans and the Near East. This policy is naturally another expression of the cry of "Tunisia, Corsica, and Nice" a few months ago. Mussolini's actions in Albania not only affected the position of Britain and France in the Eastern Mediterranean, but also aroused the anger of the world's Islamic nations (because most Albanians are Muslims), the alarm of Greece, the anxiety of Romania, and the hidden worries of Turkey. In this way, the small countries neighboring these two axes all understood that there was no peace to be had and no way to survive as neighbors of this executioner. Greece is preparing to cope with extraordinary events and concentrating its military equipment, and Yugoslavia has also ordered a partial mobilization. This is the military expression. As for the diplomatic aspect, there was the visit of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu to Turkey and the meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Saragogin to discuss ways to increase mutual defense against aggression. These all prove that due to Fascist aggression, the weak nations of Southeastern Europe have changed their policies and hope that Western European democratic countries can rise up to assist them and lead them to confront Fascism, which threatens their survival.</p>
<p>Second, Britain, due to the lessons of fact, such as the non-withdrawal of Spanish, German, and Italian invading troops, which is enough to threaten the security of its vast empire, and the current targets of Fascist attacks, such as Greece, Poland, and Romania, all have a close relationship with its own interests. Therefore, we actually heard Chamberlain announce in Parliament that he would aid countries such as Poland and Greece. At the same time, we heard voices in Parliament from the far-right Churchill, the Liberal Sinclair, and the Labour Attlee, all calling for cooperation with the Soviet Union to defend European peace. At such a time, issuing such a roar, we can assert that it has considerable power. Previously, Chamberlain and the die-hards of the Conservative Party under his leadership opposed the Soviet Union for reasons of emotion and interest, and tried every means to encourage France to break with the Soviet Union, exclude the Soviet Union from Europe, and allow Nazi Germany to freely annex the territories of weak nations in Central and Eastern Europe. As a result, they have brought about a trend in which Hitler dominates Europe and endangers the security of the British Empire. For its own security and to prevent Fascist countries from launching further acts of aggression, Britain cannot but change its past policies and encourage France to approach the Soviet Union again. According to recent news, Britain is now taking cautious steps to allow the Soviet Union to join the anti-Hitler bloc. France is also engaged in concluding a new agreement with the Soviet Union, providing automatic assistance in the event of a German attack. The content of the new agreement is roughly: "If one day France joins in resisting German aggression, the Soviet Union will immediately provide assistance to Poland and Romania." At the same time, Britain is also preparing to establish an air force agreement with the Soviet Union. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seed met with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, and the British Ambassador to France received government instructions to begin negotiations with France. These all indicate that a new combination of the British, French, and Soviet peace front is in progress. As for whether this new combination of the peace front can have a strong foundation, the key still depends on whether the British Conservative Party, such as Chamberlain, the realist faction, has truly realized its past erroneous views. Former French Foreign Minister Talbo, in his recent article "The Restoration of the Freedom Front," said, "If Britain, like France, had united with Poland and the Soviet Union of the Little Entente at an earlier period, Europe would not have seen the recent violence of force." This is a piercing statement. Therefore, the important key to the European situation in the future still depends on whether there has been a fundamental change in the policies of the current rulers of Britain. This is a problem that we are very worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Third, what is worthy of our attention is the recent two peace appeals by US President Roosevelt, which have great significance for the current critical situation. He said: If the totalitarian countries really force a war, at the beginning of their action, there will be a country that is greater than the combined power of Germany and Italy, and will be involved in it. This means that the United States will not be able to stand idly by in the event of a European war. This warning is like a head-on blow to the dictators. Although President Roosevelt's declaration, as it stands now, is only a moral force, we can easily imagine that it will soon be put into action. Roosevelt's subsequent appeal to the two dictators to guarantee that the small countries of Europe and the Near East will not be invaded for at least ten or twenty-five years is a manifestation of action. This expression can also directly prove that the United States, a major pillar of the democratic countries, is not indifferent to the aggressors at present. On the contrary, the United States is strengthening the strength of the democratic front. In other words, the unity of the world democratic front is currently becoming more solid and sufficient to give Fascism a serious blow.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Between Xinhui and Jiangmen</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Attempt to Intercept Gaoyao from Kaiping, Elite Chinese Troops Gather in Taishan County to Counterattack</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The war situation in Guangdong Province has seen continuous seesaw battles, with each stronghold changing hands multiple times. The Japanese troops in Guangdong, due to being dispatched to various fronts to assist in battle, are nearly overwhelmed. Recently, they have repeatedly telegraphed the Japanese military authorities, requesting that the Japanese troops invading various regions be transferred to Guangzhou to await orders. It has been discovered that the Japanese troops from Hainan and Weizhou Island have been continuously drawn to the Pearl River basin. On April 25th, the Japanese vessel Guangdong Maru, departing from Taiwan's south, carried hundreds of Taiwanese Japanese soldiers and a batch of military supplies. The ship briefly stopped over in Hong Kong before sailing to Guangzhou. These newly arrived Japanese troops are being successively deployed to Foshan and the Guangsan Railway front for defense. The original Japanese Iida unit stationed in Foshan has been moved to Jiujiang, seemingly with the intent to re-attack Heshan in a coordinated effort with the Japanese troops in Xinhui. As for the Xinhui and Jiangmen areas, they have been embroiled in fierce fighting for days. The Japanese troops in Xinhui City have recently attempted to break through the Ningyang Road by land and sea, exiting at Gongyi Port and Danshui Estuary, in an attempt to block the counterattack of the Chinese troops in Kaiping. Since the 21st, the Chinese troops have launched fierce attacks on Xinhui City and Jiangmen from Xinhui-Heshan and Xinkai, with the battle on the evening of the 23rd being particularly intense. Initially, the Japanese troops near Xinhui had increased to over 2,000, creating a formidable presence. Fearing that the Kaiping territory would be invaded by the Japanese troops, a part of a regular army division urgently moved to the front line. At the same time, 10,000 Guangxi soldiers also rapidly advanced to the Siyi area from the southern route, first participating with a part of their forces, and joining forces with the local self-defense groups along the Xinhui-Heshan Road to advance south. That night, in the areas of Duruan and Fuzi, they engaged in a bloody battle with the Japanese troops, causing hundreds of Japanese casualties. Japanese motorboats on the river were cut off from their return route and hastily fled along the Guantian Township river area in the eighth district of the county, causing a shock in Jiangmen. Chinese guerrilla forces took advantage of the situation to rush into the urban area of Jiangmen, attacking Japanese military organs. A part of the force also rushed to the outskirts of Xinhui City. The sounds of cannons and gunfire were incessant during this battle, and refugees from Xinhui City fled to seek refuge, causing temporary traffic congestion. Consequently, rumors spread that the Chinese troops had recovered Xinhui City and Jiangmen that night. By the next morning, Japanese air force planes urgently flew to various places to provide support. At that time, 300 members of the Chinese self-defense group fiercely attacked Gou Hill near Xinhui City, and then attacked Shuinan Township, causing the Japanese troops in Jiangmen and Xinhui City to lose contact for a time. Later, Japanese planes bombed Shuinan, and the Chinese troops began to move to new positions. However, on the 24th, Xinhui City and the northern streets of Jiangmen were still under the control of the Chinese troops. For days, both sides have occupied key positions and shelled each other. Japanese planes frequently flew over the Chinese troop positions, attempting to bomb the Chinese artillery teams. Unexpectedly, the Chinese air force also flew to the Jiangmen-Xinhui area to assist in the battle. Intense air battles occurred over Xinhui on the 24th and 25th, reportedly resulting in one Japanese plane being damaged. Judging from the current situation, there will be several major battles in the area between Xinhui and Kaiping. Kaiping is the thoroughfare to Xinxing and Gaoyao, and Sanbu in Taishan County will be contested by both armies. The elite troops of the Guangdong army are currently gathering in Sanbu, and with the participation of over 10,000 strong soldiers from Guangxi Province, it is thought that the Japanese troops will not easily succeed. The Japanese plan, in addition to the infantry advancing along the Xinkai Road, also involves using shallow-water motorboats to transport troops, penetrating Danshui Estuary, hoping to land from that location. Currently, there are twenty to thirty Japanese boats in the Jiangmen inland river, intruding into the Daze River and Sanjiang River, harassing along the river. The purpose is to first contain the area near Danshui Estuary, and cut off the waterway transportation between Sanbu and Macau. Therefore, ships traveling between Macau and Sanbu (i.e., Xinchang, Diqi, and Changsha) have stopped running. The Macau ferry service has only been operating to Muzhou, which belongs to Xinhui, since the 24th. Travelers must enter the mainland by land from there. However, amidst the tense atmosphere, the number of passengers going from Macau to Sanbu has decreased. Only refugees from Xinhui, risking their lives to escape, regard this as the only way out.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: After investigation, the Magistrate of our hometown has already been appointed by the Provincial Committee, Ping Zuren, and has been diligently leading the various districts to implement county administration, with considerable achievements. The candidates for district chiefs have also been reported to the province for approval. The seventh district chief has been replaced by Gu Fusheng, a local. Recently, upon reading yesterday's Qingpu correspondence in your newspaper, "Japanese Troops Ambushed on the Qinghu Road," we were greatly astonished to read the passage stating, "The Qingpu County Magistrate, Yan Fusheng (former seventh district chief)," etc. There is no such person as Yan Fusheng among the district chiefs. Furthermore, to claim to be the Qingpu County Magistrate is obviously a pretext to swindle and deceive, and implies ulterior motives. In addition to telegraphing County Magistrate Ping to investigate, we are deeply concerned that the outside world may be misled and deceived. Therefore, we respectfully request a correction. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated. To the Editor of Shen Bao, From the Qingpu Sojourners Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Covet Stone from Nine Peak Mountain in Songjiang and Qingpu Counties</h3>
<p>Forcibly Mining, Transporting to Shanghai for Sale, Steel and Nickel Shipped Away, Eye Witnesses Murdered, Local Gangsters Act as Accomplices</p>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: Since the guerrillas are stationed in the mountains such as Tianma Mountain, the Japanese and puppet regimes are uneasy and constantly on alert. Innocent farmers are often searched and arrested. In early January, based on reports from traitors, the Japanese military police stationed in Songjiang, together with over a hundred puppet police, transported over 5,000 tons of steel and nickel raw materials (worth millions of yuan) that were transported from the Nanshi Mint and Arsenal and buried at the foot of Tianma Mountain during the war, loading them onto dozens of civilian ships and looting them all. Recently, they coveted the stone from Nine Peak Mountain in Songjiang and Qingpu. The puppet county government and the Japanese Pacification Team issued notices, ostensibly to regulate mining on various mountains, but in reality to seize mountain stones, transport them to Shanghai for sale, and divide the profits between the Japanese and puppet regimes. With the permission of the Japanese military police in the Tianma Mountain area, a secret agent, Zhao Xieming, a rickshaw puller and local gangster in Songjiang, recruited eighty local ruffians, and the Japanese provided them with firearms to establish the Nine Peak Puppet Self-Defense Force. Zhao, through the recommendation of his adoptive father, Cai, who is currently a consultant to the puppet county government, also serves as the commander of the puppet self-defense force, stationed permanently at Tianma Mountain, behaving rampantly and excessively. The villagers are forced to pay extortion and suffer unspeakable grievances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Japanese military police obtained this huge amount of steel and nickel at Tianma Mountain, they transported it to Shanghai and then transferred it to Tokyo. The informant was a small worker who participated in the burial and received a reward of 50,000 yuan from a special Japanese military unit, but he was soon murdered in Hongkou, Shanghai. The puppet county magistrate of Songjiang also received 400 yuan, and the puppet police chief also received 400 yuan.</p>
<p>Additionally, Zhao Xieming, the commander of the Nine Peak Self-Defense Force, had considerable influence when he was a secret agent for the Japanese military police in Songjiang. Now that he is equipped with a force of eighty men, he will undoubtedly be even more unscrupulous. His master, Yang Shijie, the puppet police chief, cannot help but feel resentful. A conflict between the master and apprentice is inevitable in the near future.</p>

<h3>Overview of National Higher Education Funding (1)</h3>
<p>39.2 Million Yuan Before the War, Special Subsidy from the Boxer Indemnity Adjusted After the War</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education's competent department has compiled a detailed report and statistics on the annual increase in funding for higher education institutions across the country, as well as the adjustment methods for wartime funding. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Total Funding</p>
<p>The total annual expenditure of public and private higher education institutions (including universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools) was 17.9 million yuan in 1928. It increased to 25.5 million yuan in 1929. In the following two years, it increased by 4 million yuan each year, reaching 33.6 million yuan in 1931. From then on, affected by the September 18th Incident, there was no increase for three years. The increase continued from 1934, increasing by 2 million yuan annually, reaching 39.2 million yuan in 1936, the highest amount in previous years. From 1937, during the War of Resistance, national and provincial treasuries were tight, and other income for schools also decreased sharply. The total funding for that year decreased to 29.8 million yuan. It decreased again in 1938. As some funding has not yet been finalized, there are no accurate statistics available. It is estimated to be around 27 million yuan.</p>
<p>Sources of Funding</p>
<p>The annual income of higher education institutions is divided into three categories: national and provincial treasury funds and Boxer Indemnity income, asset and donation income, and student tuition income. National and provincial schools rely on national and provincial treasury funds as their main source of funding, while private schools rely on asset income and donations, and student tuition as their main source of funding. Taking the total funding of over 35.7 million yuan in 1935 as an example, national and provincial treasury funds and Boxer Indemnity accounted for 62%, asset income and donations accounted for 19%, student tuition accounted for 11%, and other income accounted for 8%.</p>
<p>Expenditure</p>
<p>According to the general reports submitted in 1937 (from 73 schools, accounting for five-sixths of the total number of schools), the total annual expenditure of 60 schools in 1936, excluding the expenses of affiliated schools, was over 23.32 million yuan. Among them, teaching expenses accounted for 44.1%, administrative expenses accounted for 26.5%, construction expenses accounted for 17.8%, business expenses accounted for 7.6%, and other expenses accounted for 4%. In addition, the total annual expenditure budget of 73 schools in 1937 was over 24.26 million yuan, among which teaching expenses accounted for 44.6%, administrative expenses accounted for 22.5%, construction expenses accounted for 19.3%, business expenses accounted for 9.3%, and other expenses accounted for 4.3%. If we observe the final accounts of a few universities in 1936, the lowest administrative expense accounted for 10.8% (Huazhong University in Wuchang), the highest construction expense accounted for 26.4% (Hunan University), and the highest business expense accounted for 33.3% (West China Union University). In addition, the total number of students in 60 schools in 1936 was 20,2600. Comparing this with the total amount of teaching and administrative expenses in the same year, the average annual cost per student was 790 yuan.</p>
<p>National Treasury Allocation</p>
<p>Divided into national school operating expenses and subsidies for provincial and private schools, the total national expenditure in 1936 was over 990.65 million yuan, of which 54.93 million yuan was allocated to education and culture. Of this, 19.76 million yuan was allocated to national schools' operating expenses and 2.15 million yuan was allocated to subsidies for provincial and private schools, totaling 21.91 million yuan. In 1937, the total national expenditure was over 1000.64 million yuan, of which 67.01 million yuan was allocated to education and culture. The amount allocated to higher education was 21.91 million yuan. During the War of Resistance, the national treasury reduced expenditures (in July and August 1937, the allocated amount was issued according to the monthly allocation of the original budget, and after that, it was issued at 70%, and a part was suspended). The actual amount issued to national schools was reduced to 22.21 million yuan, and the subsidies for provincial and private schools were reduced to over 1.5 million yuan, totaling 23.7 million yuan. The budget for 1938, from July to December 1938, was based on the principle of extending the actual amount issued from January to June 1937. It was set at over 6.7 million yuan for national schools and over 660,000 yuan for subsidies for provincial and private schools, totaling 7.37 million yuan. In addition, an average of 170,000 to 180,000 yuan was spent per month on the relocation of schools in the war zone and the relief of faculty and students in the war zone.</p>

<h3>Li Huitang Suffers Cramps, Hong Kong Football Team Loses to Philippines</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Suffers a Miserable Defeat of 1-3 in the Philippines-Hong Kong Interport Match</p>
<p>(Manila, May 1st, Associated Press) - The Manila Football Team of the Philippines defeated the Hong Kong Interport Football Team 3-1 last night at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. This was the first battle of the three Philippines-Hong Kong interport football matches. Last night, there were more than 10,000 spectators. The Philippine team controlled the entire game, advancing and retreating like a machine, with a defense like an iron wall. Li Huitang, the soul of the Hong Kong team, suffered cramps shortly after entering the game and could not show his skills at all. Neither team scored in the first half. All the goals were scored in the second half. On Tuesday, the Hong Kong team will play against the La Salle University team.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) - The Hong Kong football interport team to the Philippines departed from Hong Kong on the President Cleveland at midnight on the 27th to Manila for three matches in the Philippines: (1) Hong Kong-Philippines interport match on April 30th; (2) Hong Kong team vs. Philippine champion La Salle University on May 2nd; (3) Hong Kong team vs. this year's league champion YOC Club on May 4th. The Hong Kong team has a total of seventeen players, and the Secretary of the Football Association, Mr. Gouldenby, is the team leader.

<p>The three football matches in the Philippines will all be held at night under floodlights, which is very unfavorable to the visiting team. This year, the Philippine team came to Hong Kong on the first day of the Lunar New Year and lost two of the three matches. Now they are determined to wait at their leisure, which is a considerable advantage. The Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation has stipulated that all three matches will adopt a 70-minute system. If there is a tie, the match will be replayed the next day. If there is another tie, an additional 20 minutes will be added. After the competition, the Hong Kong team will return to Hong Kong on a Taikoo Shipping Company vessel, arriving back here on May 10th (Wednesday), so that the South China Athletic Association can play the Xuhe Cup final against the Navy on the 13th (Saturday).</p>

<h3>Financial Market's Astounding Change in Cash Prices Over Two Days</h3>
<p>Peak Reached 2,140 Yuan</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (May 1st) was Labor Day, and this newspaper was closed as usual for the day. However, significant fluctuations occurred in both cash and foreign exchange grey markets that day. In particular, the rise in cash prices was astonishing. Therefore, we are reporting on the market conditions of the previous two days together below.</p>
<p>Cash Prices Surge to Unprecedented Heights on One Day</p>
<p>The cash price grey market on May 1st experienced a sudden and intense surge. Market sentiment was chaotic and uncertain. Prices broke through several major barriers, from 2,080 yuan to 2,130 yuan, and even reached a high of 2,140 yuan. The factors contributing to this sharp rise were sixfold: (1) Reports that day indicated the imminent establishment of Hua Xing Bank and rumors of the issuance of a large amount of counterfeit currency to undermine China's legal tender, causing widespread public anxiety; (2) The influx of "United Bank counterfeit banknotes" caused gold prices in that region to rise continuously, prompting Tianjin merchants to commission securities firms such as Dajing to purchase gold on their behalf; (3) Gold prices in Hong Kong were also relatively stable, encouraging purchases from Hong Kong merchants; (4) Foreign exchange was slightly weak due to competition between Tianjin merchants and certain parties, with spot prices around 1 shilling and 8.25 pence and the US exchange rate at 16.0625. Foreign firms with substantial settlements also purchased foreign exchange, leading to tighter futures; (5) Investors in the city with wavering sentiment had lost interest in government bonds in recent days and turned to the gold market; and (6) The shortage of circulating funds in the market led to surprising developments in the gold market. Initially, gold shops had a limited supply, keeping prices stable at 2,077 yuan (the day's low). After the opening, pawnshops began selling, while money exchanges and securities firms (both acting on behalf of northern merchants) and speculators competed to buy, causing sellers to raise prices repeatedly. The price struggled around 2,090 yuan until noon. In the afternoon, securities firms made an all-out effort to acquire gold, further fueling the rise. The market opened at 2,100 yuan. Later, a gold shop and a money exchange (both acting on behalf of speculators) engaged in reckless buying, further intensifying the market's upward momentum. Consequently, the day saw unprecedented highs, with prices soaring to 2,140 yuan at one point. However, due to excessive speculation, profit-taking led to a slight pullback, closing at 2,127 yuan, still a substantial increase of 50 yuan. Trading volume was robust, reaching around 1,500 taels. Pawnshop gold prices also jumped by 5 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable. Yesterday saw a reversal, with a drop of 7 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday (May 2nd), the cash price grey market in the city saw a sudden shift from frenzy to stability, with prices initially rising before falling. After briefly surpassing the 2,130 yuan mark, prices retreated, eventually closing at a low of 2,120 yuan. The market gradually returned to normal, and public sentiment stabilized, as it became clear that the rumors from the previous day were unlikely to shake China's financial stability. Initially, money exchanges and securities firms, such as Defu, acting on behalf of Xianben from the northern merchants, and wealthy businessmen continued to purchase gold. Moreover, the after-effects of the previous day's surge were still present, pushing prices to a high of 2,134 yuan. However, gold shops actively sold, and pawnshops offered more supply than demand, causing prices to weaken at noon. In the afternoon, under pressure from profit-taking, the downward trend intensified, ultimately reversing the previous gains and falling by 7 yuan. Trading volume declined from high to low, totaling about 800 taels. Surprisingly, the opening gold price did not fall. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Trading Volume Declined from High to Low</p>
<p>At the start, buyers immediately reduced bids from 2,127 yuan per ten-tael bar, while sellers only offered supply at 2,130 yuan. Both sides held firm until 9:45 AM, when the first transaction occurred. A securities firm acquired ten taels from a gold shop at the opening price of 2,130 yuan, 3 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Subsequently, a money exchange also acquired 50 taels from a gold shop at the same opening price. Another money exchange then acquired 50 taels from a gold shop at 2,129 yuan. Following this, a pawnshop (acting on behalf of an outsider) and securities firms engaged in reciprocal buying, gradually driving prices higher. The pawnshop acquired 50 taels from a gold shop at 2,131 yuan, and a pawnshop acquired 50 taels from a fellow pawnshop at 2,132 yuan. The money exchanges also transacted 50 taels among themselves. Later, a securities firm acquired 50 taels from a money exchange at 2,134 yuan. Subsequently, as a gold shop increased its selling pressure, taking advantage of the high prices, market sentiment turned downward. The gold shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange at 2,131 yuan. At a time when buyers were scarce, prices fell by another 6 yuan. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange at 2,125 yuan. At that time, a pawnshop stepped in to absorb supply, driving prices upward again. The pawnshop acquired 50 taels from a pawnshop at 2,130 yuan. Later, as the pawnshop stopped buying and the gold shop resumed selling, prices declined again. The gold shop sold 50 taels to a securities firm at 2,126 yuan. The money exchange sold 50 taels to a pawnshop at 2,124 yuan. Later, a pawnshop sold 50 taels to a gold shop, with the price falling to 2,121 yuan, followed by another sale of 50 taels to a gold shop at 2,122 yuan. At noon, another gold shop acquired 50 taels from a pawnshop, pushing prices back up to 2,125 yuan, serving as the afternoon price. After the close, pawnshops and money exchanges were heard offering to sell at 2,122 yuan, but there were no buyers, and no transactions were reported. In the afternoon, trading suddenly became quiet, with less than 100 taels changing hands, and the trend was slightly downward. Initially, a money exchange transacted 20 taels at 2,122 yuan. Subsequently, both supply and demand were scarce, and prices remained stagnant. Until after 4:00 PM, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a pawnshop at 2,120 yuan, marking the closing price. The final price was 7 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price, with a daily range of 14 yuan. The selling price of cash gold shops was 2,128 yuan, and the buying price was 2,113 yuan. The current benchmark gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with no trading activity.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Steady at 216 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate for ornamental gold per tael remained unchanged yesterday. The six long-established businesses maintained the previous day's increase of 216 yuan, while newer businesses quoted 214 yuan for selling and 208 yuan for buying.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>According to a London cable yesterday, the price of British pure gold per ounce remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence. Consequently, the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash remained at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed price for Customs gold remained unchanged at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of British pure gold did not change, while the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.0625. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were actively settling payments, and Tianjin merchants were also absorbing currencies. Fortunately, banks provided ample supply, keeping market prices stable. However, forward rates tightened, making it difficult to settle. The grey market rate surged by over 50 yuan on Monday, but the market calmed down slightly yesterday, although fluctuations still reached 14 yuan. British and American gold pounds were in high demand due to the surge in the grey market rate, and wealthy individuals actively purchased them. British and American gold bills were also actively traded due to the weakness of forward foreign exchange rates and eager customer demand. Foreign currencies rose sharply the day before yesterday. Yesterday, most currencies continued to rise, except for British and American gold pounds. Trading in the association was brisk. Chen Tai sold US$400 in American gold bills to Yongheng, and Yongheng sold 50 pounds in British gold bills to Zhenxing. Xiang Kang sold US$200 in American gold bills to Chen Tai, and Zhenxing sold US$500 in American gold bills to Hongchang. Chen Tai sold 20 pounds in British gold bills to Zuanxing, and Sen Tai sold 30 pounds in British gold bills to Zhenxing. Sen Tai also sold 400 Hong Kong dollars in bills to Qin Tai, and Chen Tai sold 30 pounds in British gold bills to Zhenxing. Sen Tai sold 30 pounds in British gold bills to Zhenxing. Yesterday's market prices changed as follows: British gold pounds decreased by 1 jiao, British gold bills decreased by 2 fen, American gold pounds decreased by 1 jiao, American gold bills increased by 1 li, Hong Kong dollars decreased by 2 li, French franc bills increased by 7.5 hao, Singapore dollars decreased by 5 li, Canadian dollars increased by 5 li, Philippine dollars increased by 1 fen, and Australian gold bills increased by 1 jiao. Prices of other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Demand for British and American Exchange Surges: Spot Supply Falls Short, Eagerly Settling for Forward Contracts</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (May 1st), exchange rates between China and Britain and HSBC remained unchanged, while the grey market experienced slight fluctuations. Market sentiment seemed slightly weak. The news that "Hua Xing Yi Xing" was about to be established and would issue counterfeit currency, although not impacting China's entire gold market, caused some public anxiety. As a result, Tianjin merchants and certain parties actively purchased spot British and American gold, and various import firms also slightly increased settlement. Although the supply of funds from Chinese and foreign banks was still relatively strong, at prices of 8.25 pence for British gold and 16.0625 yuan for American exchange, many firms feared that they would not be able to settle their accounts. Forward contracts were eagerly settled by major foreign firms, and US banks were holding prices high, leading to tighter forward rates. Trading volume was very high throughout the day. Hong Kong exchange rates also weakened slightly due to strong purchasing by speculators and foreign firms, and limited supply from outsiders. As a result, rates tightened by 0.125.</p>
<p>Yesterday (May 2nd), the exchange market saw Hua merchants, cotton yarn merchants, British banks (acting on behalf of Tianjin merchants), and major import firms actively purchase spot British and American gold. However, foreign banks such as HSBC were only willing to provide limited funds for settlements by foreign firms, and feared that it would be difficult to secure large amounts. Those eager to settle contracts became anxious and actively settled forward British and American gold contracts. The supply of funds from major foreign banks was quite limited, leading to tighter forward rates and a larger price difference. If prices were further increased, it might attract arbitrageurs. In addition, the Orient suddenly issued a British-Sai-American exchange rate of 4.6806 yuan. Trading volume was very high throughout the day. Hong Kong exchange rates continued to weaken as supply from outsiders became even more limited and foreign firms actively purchased.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, both near and far rates in London rose by 0.0625, silver prices in New York remained unchanged, and gold prices in London also remained unchanged. British-American and British-Shanghai exchange rates were stable, while British-French exchange rates rose slightly by 0.003. American-British exchange rates were 0.0625, American-Shanghai exchange rates were higher by 0.03, and American-French exchange rates rose by 0.0625. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. At the opening, banks quoted spot selling prices of 8.25 pence for British exchange and 16.0625 yuan for American exchange, both unchanged from the previous close. After the opening, Chinese merchants and foreign firms competed to purchase exchange, but foreign banks such as HSBC were only willing to provide limited funds. It was estimated that Chinese merchants and foreign firms purchased spot British gold at 8.25 pence and spot American exchange at 16.0625 yuan from HSBC and other foreign banks. As HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged and the silver balance also remained steady, the foreign exchange sector increased, and Chinese merchants and cotton yarn merchants actively purchased forward British and American exchange. In addition, foreign banks held prices high and were unwilling to sell cheaply, leading to tighter forward rates. It was estimated that foreign firms and Chinese merchants settled this month's British gold at 8.21875 pence with HSBC and purchased this month's American exchange from Datong at only 15.9375 yuan. Subsequently, they purchased August's British gold at 8.125 pence from McCalle and settled August's American exchange from a certain bank at only 15.75 yuan. Near noon, the Orient purchased British-Sai-American exchange, with an exchange rate of 4.6806 yuan. Afterwards, foreign firms switched to purchasing spot Hong Kong exchange, and outsiders' willingness to sell was weak, causing the forward rate to weaken. Foreign firms settled spot Hong Kong exchange at only 55.5 yuan from a foreign bank. At the noon close, HSBC's selling prices were 8.25 pence for British gold, 16.0625 yuan for American exchange, and 55.5 yuan for Hong Kong exchange, making it difficult for foreign firms to settle large accounts.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, foreign firms slightly increased purchasing, and foreign banks were still willing to provide funds, resulting in stable forward rates. Foreign firms settled spot British gold at 8.25 pence with HSBC. Subsequently, Youli, acting on behalf of Tianjin merchants, settled spot American exchange at 16.0625 yuan with a certain bank. As a result, there was little change. Later, a foreign bank sold spot Hong Kong exchange at 55.625 yuan to a money exchange, resulting in a slight strengthening of rates. At the evening close, banks' selling prices were 8.25 pence for British exchange, 16.0625 yuan for American exchange, and 55.625 yuan for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, compared to the previous evening's close, British and American exchange rates did not change, while Hong Kong exchange rates tightened by 0.125.</p>

<h3>Securities: Foreign Bonds Excited, Domestic Bonds Relatively Weak</h3>
<p>The securities grey market yesterday continued the previous day's sideways movement, remaining weak. Fearing a potential collapse, long positions attempted to prop up prices using various tactics, but short positions continued to dominate. Today, May 3rd, is a special holiday in commemoration of the May Fourth Movement, an unprecedented event. Yesterday's market saw weak activity at the opening. Long positions on Contract 20 continued to buy to prevent a collapse. Defu and Houji on Contract 35 were buying, while Tongkang, Hengfu, and Contract 11 were selling. Prices edged lower by about 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, there was some unexpected price competition, with buyers actually selling and sellers actually buying, or even artificially inflating prices. Prices recovered slightly by 0.05 or 0.1 yuan. Type C bonds remained unchanged throughout the day. The net result was a mixed bag, with prices fluctuating by around 0.05 or 0.1 yuan. The total volume of transactions was estimated at around one million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>

<h3>Grain: Flour Mill Prices Rise, Reaching 4.45 Yuan in Cash</h3>
<p>Yesterday, flour mill prices showed signs of improvement. Since the launch of sales by merchant groups last weekend, North and South merchant groups have made significant transactions. No. 2 flour prices have gradually increased since starting to rise last weekend. Due to the precarious international situation and rising prices abroad, Shanghai's existing supply of imported flour is limited. Although new shipments have arrived, they have not had a significant impact on the market. As a result, mills have repeatedly maintained prices. Yesterday, the opening price for No. 2 flour rose by another 0.05 yuan, reaching 4.45 yuan in cash. Over the past two days, the total volume of transactions has been over 100,000 bags. Yesterday afternoon, sales by the North China merchant group weakened due to the sharp fall in Tianjin exchange rates in recent days and the high risk of procuring goods. Local flour prices are reportedly high, and they plan to take action after the goods are procured and shipped. The Southern merchant group also made fewer purchases than in the previous two days. As for the imported flour market, the situation remained stagnant. Due to limited supply, both buyers and sellers were holding back. As a result, mid-range brands have also risen by several cents compared to last week. It is rumored that Jian Yuan Company and other foreign firms have a new ship from Citibank arriving today with over 200,000 bags. The goods are being unloaded at the Blue Funnel Wharf. The future of the market will depend on how these goods are sold.</p>
<p>As for flour exports, 37,700 bags were shipped to Tianjin and 5,650 bags were shipped to Shantou yesterday.</p>
<h3>Thick and Thin Japonica Rice Reaches Price Limits</h3>
<p>Yesterday, various sources from the riverside docks arrived with six or seven batches of Su Tong rice, while wheeled steamed buns brought over 1,700 packages of Su Tong rice. It is rumored that a certain party in Wuxi has permitted the daily transport of five truckloads, hence 750 packages arrived. Although the market lacks substantial demand, due to the limited supply, sentiment is positive, and the market is inherently good. However, the strict price limits have caused high-quality goods to disappear from the market. The prices of both thick and thin japonica rice in original packaging have all been set around the price limit. The situation for Du Yang Jian Bu and Jian Da Bang rice is similar to that of japonica rice. Glutinous rice prices continue to rise by twenty to thirty cents due to the limited supply, opening at nineteen yuan plus some change.</p>
<h3>Wheat Supply Gradually Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, the wheat supply has gradually increased with sporadic shipments arriving from the Beijing-Zhen area and inland Changzhou. The stockpiles in Shanghai have slightly increased. Furthermore, the foreign wheat self-ordered by foreign firms has also recently arrived. In addition to the previous shipment received by Fuxin Mill, a Japanese-owned flour mill also ordered a shipment of foreign wheat from a certain foreign firm. Therefore, the demand for local wheat is becoming increasingly sluggish. However, amidst the rising flour prices, holders of wheat are still trying to struggle, so the surface appears stable. However, the actual price opened at only six yuan and eight cents, lacking substantial buyers. This is because the spot price of foreign wheat has also fallen below seven yuan, and the market is feared to remain difficult to develop.</p>
<h3>Brokers and Speculators Vigorously Trade Ke Xian Rice, Foreign Rice Inventories Depleted</h3>
<p>Ke Xian rice arrivals were low and sales brisk yesterday, with the market continuing to rise. Yesterday, outbound sales on this street were not very enthusiastic, but brokers were quite greedy because market rumors were rampant. One rumor said that transshipment groups and Japanese merchants were directly loading goods in the producing areas. Another rumor said that the producing areas would change to using "counterfeit currency." Therefore, the market and sentiment uniformly rose. Jing Wu Xian rice each rose by ten to twenty cents. Orders for foreign rice were still one yuan short, and total Shanghai inventories were only 12,000 to 13,000 bags of Saigon rice and 3,000 bags of small-grained rice. High-quality Saigon rice was yesterday quoted as high as seventeen yuan and sixty to seventy cents, second-quality at seventeen yuan and thirty cents or so, and small-grained rice was sold for thirteen yuan per shi in quantities of several dozen bags.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: How the April Futures Were Settled – Total Transactions 23,000 Barrels – Actual Delivery at 11% Still Uneven</h3>
<p>Dalian soybean oil, April futures, were completely settled on Monday. The settlement procedures were announced by a Japanese firm, stating that due to the impact of control measures, it was not possible to deliver the full quantity of the orders. With the consent of the buyer, the difference was converted into cash, but the amount of actual delivery was still uneven. It is reported that the total number of transactions was 23,000 barrels, and the total amount delivered was 2,870 barrels. Ito Eigawa threw out 1,300 barrels and delivered 270 barrels; Fukutoyo Yokoyama threw out 5,500 barrels and delivered 1,000 barrels; Mitsubishi threw out 5,200 barrels and delivered 200 barrels; Mitsui threw out 4,400 barrels and delivered 800 barrels; Yoshida threw out 6,600 barrels and delivered 600 barrels. The industry agreed to a uniform delivery rate of 11% (settlement was also calculated at 11%). However, it was still necessary to cut off the fractional amounts, so actual sales customers were greatly affected. Yesterday, the Dalian spot oil market opened with a weak trend, continuing the previous day's fatigue. Later, because the futures were difficult to settle, customer requests were not met, but because of speculative activity, the market became prosperous again. The closing price was one yuan and fifty cents higher than the opening price. A total of over 500 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded, with the price rising from forty-four yuan to forty-five yuan and fifty cents. Jiaozhou soybean oil was settled for fifty pieces, at a price of thirty-two yuan. Lianqi oil was settled for twenty pieces, at a price of forty-three yuan. Although the selling price of these oils was five cents to one yuan lower than last Saturday, these were all opening prices, and the oil was not traded when the market turned upward.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,000 barrels of raw oil were transported from Yantai, 1,160 pieces of soybean oil from Tianjin, 11,850 packages of soybeans, and 400 pieces of cottonseed oil.</p>
<h3>Coal: Another Large Shipment of Indian Coal Arrives</h3>
<p>Today, another 7,431 tons of Indian coal arrived in Shanghai, shipped by the Helga Moller, an agent of Jardine Matheson, from Calcutta. It is expected to arrive at the port at 6:00 AM this morning, berthed at floating docks number 33 and 34 in Yangshupu, to be transferred to the warehouse. Yesterday, a certain firm in the city opened a sale of over 200 tons of Yuanshan coal, priced at thirty-two yuan per ton for standard coal, thirty-three yuan for screened lumps, and twenty-seven yuan for fines, all from the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tianjin Cigarettes Enthusiastically Purchased, Local Factory Original Nails</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been quite brisk recently, with purchases from the northern route being the largest. The most popular items are new lead wire, black iron billets, tinplate, company iron, ribbed steel bars, and British steel plates. Original nails from local factories, which had been quiet for a long time, were purchased by northern route merchants yesterday in droves. Tianjin cigarettes and other groups purchased a total of over 3,000 barrels. The market price per barrel was sixteen yuan and twenty-five cents. The city's goods were almost entirely purchased at once, and the asking price continued to rise by twenty-five cents. Therefore, the recent market asking price is said to be sixteen yuan and fifty cents.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Profiting This Time, Spot Yarn Prices Surge and Retreat Rapidly, Factories Seize the Opportunity to Open Large Quantities Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market on the day before yesterday (the 1st) saw the highest peak price of 450 yuan, which then slightly declined due to profit-taking. Recently, the market has been turbulent and rapidly changing, but actual trading has declined. Merchants are wary of the rapid surge and retreat and dare not act rashly. However, general speculators are frequently entering and exiting the market due to various rumors, resulting in lively trading, and the market changes several times a day. Large holders who profited have already settled their positions one after another, but those who drag in goods are particularly excited when prices fall. In the afternoon, rumors revived, saying that northern merchants were still coming to drag goods due to the devaluation of Japanese puppet currency, and sentiment was revived, with a buying frenzy breaking out. The market price immediately jumped by four or five yuan, and the trend became increasingly chaotic and inconsistent. By the time of closing, it softened slightly. According to another source, the factories have opened a massive sale, which remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As for the current yarn situation, the market opened slightly higher in the early morning due to positive sentiment, with the asking price increasing by one yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 445 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 432.3 yuan. Except for merchants from Shantou buying, there were no other transactions. Then, due to weak real demand, many sellers crowded the market, and the price gradually fell. In an instant, it fell by eight or nine yuan. The warehouse receipt price was 422 yuan, a drop of ten yuan. After the price drop, someone came to absorb it, and it recovered three or four yuan. The closing price for spot goods was 435 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 425 yuan. The afternoon opening was flat, with the warehouse receipt price at 425.5 yuan. Shortly after, a salesperson from the Shenxin Factory bought several hundred bales of 20-count Double Horse warehouse receipt yarn, and the price immediately rose. The warehouse receipt price reached 430 yuan, and goods from outside warehouses were also quoted at 440 yuan, but sales were still scarce. The closing price softened slightly. According to statistics, various merchants bought a total of 1,665 bales throughout the day. The prices of 20-count Double Horse and Big Woman all fell by 4.5 yuan, 20-count Special Jincheng fell by more than ten yuan, Shepherd fell by eight yuan, Waking Lion fell by ten yuan, and Double Globe fell by eight yuan. The factories did not take any action. Yesterday, 220 bales of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, 25 bales to Yantai, 845 bales to Shantou, and 205 bales to Hong Kong. Also, the previous day's transactions totaled 2,859 bales, with factories opening 850 bales. The amount purchased by various merchants is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Fellow traders 1,165, Shantou 250, Hong Kong 75</p>
<p>Inland 130, Yunnan 40, Total 1,665</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market initially fell by 15 yuan, but after rumors revived in the afternoon, it rose again. However, actual trading was at a standstill, relying solely on rumors as a tool, resulting in an unstable market. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was around 410 yuan.</p>
<h3>Local Cotton Mills Begin to Expand</h3>
<p>Indian Cotton Arrivals and Sales at 7,000 to 8,000, Japanese Mills No Longer Auctioning Flying Cotton</p>
<p>Local cotton business is gradually showing signs of activity, with selling prices rising. This is because yarn prices have been steadily increasing recently, and the procurement price of foreign cotton is higher, leading to optimistic sentiment. Shenxin and Xinyu factories are independently procuring raw cotton, while other factories still lack demand. As for cotton firms, there is a lack of spot local cotton, and sources are not smooth, so most have switched to operating foreign cotton. Sources from northern Jiangsu are arriving successively, but the quantity is very small. The day before yesterday, 728 bales of Tong cotton arrived, and yesterday another 248 bales arrived. The following is a list of spot cotton transactions for the past two days. In the cotton market, due to strong opposition from all parties to the government's cotton export subsidies, multiple parties closed their positions, causing prices to fall by ten points. However, the potential for export subsidies is also quite strong, and if they can be realized, the market price will still have a great change. Yesterday, various fellow traders settled their near-term prices, so the near-term rose by more than ten points, while the far-term fell by ten points. Compared with the previous week, Indian cotton was unchanged, but the exchange rate for the far-term was extremely tight, and the converted legal currency price of cotton rose by more than one yuan per dan.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, the recent surge in yarn prices has triggered small transactions of foreign cotton. The day before yesterday, various Chinese factories ordered a total of 4,000 bales of Indian cotton, mostly of the Pingguo Jian and Bailuoqu qualities, at prices of 57 and 74 yuan respectively. Yesterday, there were another 3,000 bales of transactions. Japanese factories are in great need of cotton and have been actively searching for spot goods in the market in recent days. Most of the cotton that arrived at the previous cotton firms has already been sold to Japanese factories, and the prices offered are quite high, so all cotton firms are happy to trade. The following is a breakdown of yesterday's cotton market converted to factory delivery prices.</p>
<p>Raw Materials Category Factory Delivery with Tax</p>
<p>60-count Egyptian Cotton Superior 104.55</p>
<p>Also Also Medium 101.60</p>

<p>The Shanghai Textile Factory's Flying Cotton used to be sold every month on the first day of the month, but the bidding was canceled on the first day of this month and was generally taken over by Shanghai Japanese Flying Cotton Industry. Other Japanese factories are in progress. The details will be published in "Recent Flying Cotton Industry Trends" and published immediately.</p>
<p>The Jama Talman, a ship managed by the British Company, arrived with 8,020 bales of cotton loaded from India and has been unloaded at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong.</p>
<h3>Finished Goods: Cotton Cloth Price Increases Ultimately Unstoppable</h3>
<p>Bourgeoisie Hoarding Spot Goods, Fueling the Rising Trend</p>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday and the day before, the cloth market, due to the sharp rise in raw yarn and thread prices, Dongding first jumped horizontally, and the national cloth market also saw unprecedented price increases. The hoarding mentality of white goods was the most enthusiastic, with coarse cloth increasing in price by five cents to one yuan per bolt. British Jardine Matheson factory's light and heavy weight grades generally increased by more than one yuan per bolt. Fine cloth and fine twill also soared by about one yuan per bolt. Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth rose from 14.25 yuan last week to 15.5 yuan. Shenxin Fugui, fine twill, rose from 12.9 yuan last week to 14 yuan. Current sales merchants were indifferent to the soaring prices and temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude, with only scattered sales of dozens of pieces. Local street hoarders still had the ability to absorb it. Coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine cloth amounted to over 210 pieces. Among the dyed and bleached goods, the light-colored goods were saturated due to seasonal factors, while the dark-colored goods were just beginning to develop. Therefore, the most scarce stock among dark-colored goods, Serge Line Ni, rose by one yuan per bolt. Luen Cheong Kowloon Mountain Serge rose from 13.9 yuan last week to 15 yuan. Blue cloth colored twill rose by five cents to seven and a half cents per bolt, while the rise in light-colored goods was weaker. Bleached cloth rose by two and a half cents to seven and a half cents per bolt. Poplin and other handicraft goods also rose slightly. Luen Cheong printed goods, printed cloth, rose by two and a half cents per bolt. Satin, Crow silk, hemp yarn and other goods were all sold at the original prices. Transactions were more prevalent among hoarders. Local street hoarders took in nearly 300 boxes of Luen Cheong printed cloth, Yuan Yu silk, blue cloth, straight tribute satin, and Serge. Local street stores and guerrilla areas in Jing Wu and Bengbu were the most active in trading.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>White goods, fine cloth, and fine twill, due to continuous sharp increases by northern merchants, have repeatedly created high prices. Furthermore, market rumors reported the establishment of "Huaxing Counterfeit Bank," which will issue counterfeit currency. Industrial and commercial bourgeoisie panicked and rushed to hoard real goods, targeting yarn and cloth. Therefore, the white goods market was very chaotic the day before yesterday. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was once sold for 16 yuan per bolt, and Yang He fine twill futures for 15 yuan. After profit-takers emerged among fellow traders, it slightly recovered. Although there were many changes in between, the fluctuations were significant. At the close, Dragon Head spot goods were 15.25 yuan. Fine cloth and fine twill totaled five to six thousand pieces, but mostly were speculators, and real sales were very scarce. Therefore, the market atmosphere weakened yesterday. The lowest price for Dragon Head fine cloth was 14.6 yuan, and the result was 14.75 yuan. Futures also fell back to 15.25 yuan. Yang He fine twill spot goods were 14 yuan, and futures also fell to 14.2 yuan. Tianjin merchants still took in about a thousand pieces in the morning market, and local street hoarders also continued to trade a thousand pieces. Therefore, although the market fell, the trend remained firm. Four Gentlemen Serge straight tribute has increased sales to four corners and eight or nine points per yard, and sales are also brisk.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Yesterday, 300 pieces of cloth were shipped to Tianjin, 150 pieces to Yantai, 140 pieces to Shantou, and 190 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Recently Popular: Celadon Green Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market has remained firm, with trading still strong in the local streets. Wan Li Ding, Yu Sha Ni, Pang Pi Chu, hemp glue cloth, white canvas, yellow twill, etc., which are needed for summer sales, have been more actively traded. Light gray thin woolen fabrics are popular for both Chinese and Western clothing. Celadon green woolen fabrics have recently become popular. Whether it is Harris, Shawi Ni, thin woolen fabrics, Yu Sha Ni, various Western clothing woolen fabrics with and without words, genuine and fake Shi Pao Teks, etc., all sell extremely well. Most customers choose celadon green. However, there is a shortage of spot goods, and even those willing to raise prices to obtain them are hard to come by at the moment.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Sees New High Price Again</h3>
<p>May Silk Market Will Be the Same as April, But Don't Ignore New York Silk Sales</p>
<p>The overseas silk market rose again yesterday. New York near-term rose one corner, far-term rose seven points, 83 points 75 points. Japanese silk spot goods each rose eight points. Yokohama spot goods rose forty-three yuan, breaking through the 1,200 yuan mark and rising another ten yuan, opening at an unprecedented high price of 1,210 yuan. The far-term rose fifteen yuan. The phenomenon of special profitability in near-term and spot silk remains the same as before. According to this journal's previous prediction, the number of inventories in New York's raw silk statistics at the end of April will inevitably decrease again, which has been confirmed by Reuters. Therefore, it is inevitable that the silk market sentiment will take off again at the beginning of May. However, this journal respectfully advises the Shanghai silk market not to be too optimistic, because last month's actual sales of raw silk in New York sharply decreased by 10,061 dan, which may limit the future price increase ability.</p>
<p>The Shanghai silk market also rose accordingly yesterday, but because foreign firms' price limits rose more sluggishly, trading was not very smooth. 7/8 points 20-22 opened at 1,790 yuan, which was 40 yuan higher than the previous day. It is predicted that the previous high price record of 1,800 yuan can be broken in the current price increase. However, the highest principle of operating industry and commerce is to make commodities and currency circulate quickly, not to wait and see the market sentiment and hold the selling price. Yesterday, Dachang, Renji and other firms imported a total of 50 dan, all for near-term or spot transactions. Indian foreign firms imported Zhuan Li Jing Shangxia Gan each five batches, and the price was gradually firming. Observing the market situation, the silk market in early May will spend in the same rising trend as the previous month. The only difference is the sharp decline in New York's actual sales in April. However, this point is precisely a characteristic that we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>On the 30th, 30 pieces of raw silk were shipped from Haiphong, and 768 pieces of tea were shipped from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In February exports silk fabrics accounted for sixteen pieces shipped to Hong Kong and tea accounted for 140 shipped to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Toona Sinensis Arrivals, Watch for Price Drops</h3>
<p>New Toona sinensis arrived from the Xinjiang wheel yesterday in four hundred bundles, the source is pouring, the market plummeted but the cost of high-priced goods still maintains its original price of 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Transshipment Coarse Whites, Sharply Rises by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegrams, crude whites rose two pence seventy-five for the near-term and two pence twenty-five for the far-term, so the market situation remained tight. The association allocated plates, and transshipment goods of 24 coarse whites were initially allocated at nineteen yuan fifty-five cents and also to the goods arriving by the 13th seven cents or eight cents were allocated, for a total of 900 bundles traded. Spot goods did not rise or fall much. Dutch Reds rose two cents to eighteen yuan, and transshipment goods traded at twelve cents or thirteen cents. Taikoo Che B western warehouse goods rose one point five corner to 27.45 yuan, with a hundred bundles traded. The local factory No. 1 ice was one yuan higher than before, at 33 yuan, and Crystal Ming ice was 34.5 yuan. In the end, transshipment coarse whites even reached 20 yuan, Dutch Reds also reached twelve yuan and five cents, Taikoo Che Whites HK$10.75, and there was a telegram for June goods, but no reply was received. National sugar rose more slowly, Chao sugar Huanggang Qing opened at fifteen yuan one cent, the second fifteen yuan to 14.89 cents, with over five hundred bundles traded, cotton Reds four hundred and some bundles, sixteen yuan one cent or two cents, Jian gang miscellaneous roads Yang opened at eighteen yuan and five cents, ordinary miscellaneous roads Qing thirteen yuan four cents or five cents, with three hundred bundles traded.

<h3>"Hua Xing Bank" Counterfeit Notes - Jianghai Customs Refuses to Accept - Silver and Money Trades Also Decide Not to Accept - Japanese Puppet Destruction of Finance Once Again Fails</h3>
<p>The counterfeit "Reformed Government" and various Japanese banks jointly established "Hua Xing Bank" held its inaugural meeting at the New Asia Hotel on May 1st, announcing its establishment. Chen Jintao was appointed as the president, and Japanese national Kijima Isoichi as the vice president. Other Chinese individuals participating in this illegal organization include Shen Erchang (Zi Jixuan), former manager of the Savings and Trust Department of the Continental Bank; Qian Daji (Zi Shucheng), former manager of the Dalian branch of the Jin Cheng Bank; and Zhou Wenrui, former managing director of the Jiang Zhe Bank. After the bank's establishment, it decided to issue counterfeit notes. According to Japanese claims, foreign banks have agreed to accept these counterfeit notes. However, the truthfulness of this claim is questionable. While various counterfeit government agencies will naturally use these counterfeit notes, the Jianghai Customs has decided to refuse acceptance. The original Japanese plan was to exchange the counterfeit notes for goods from the occupied areas, then exchange them for legal tender (法幣), and then use the legal tender to purchase foreign exchange. However, in reality, outside of the cities and towns in the occupied areas, the countryside is still controlled by Chinese guerrillas. Not only is it impossible to use counterfeit currency, but carrying it is also dangerous. Farmers are unwilling and afraid to sell goods for counterfeit currency. Furthermore, the members of the Silver and Money Trades Association have also decided to refuse to accept these counterfeit banknotes, so the overall financial situation in Shanghai will not be significantly affected.</p>
<p>Restricting Trade to Provide Support</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the counselor of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, yesterday (the 1st), indicated at a reception for reporters that trade would be restricted in Shanghai to support the paper money issued by the Hua Xing Commercial Establishment, which opened in Hongkou yesterday. When asked about the possibility of merchants being forced to obtain export licenses from this bank or banks under Japanese protection, he declined to comment, implying that restrictions may be implemented. A statement issued by the Domei News Agency yesterday stated that the Hua Xing Commercial Bank has a capital of "50 million yuan" and was established according to the laws of the "Reformed Government." It will issue paper money that can be easily exchanged for foreign currency.</p>
<p>The Source of Foreign Exchange is Unpredictable</p>
<p>These last few words prompted reporters to question the counselor. The counselor replied to the initial question, stating that the Hua Xing Commercial Bank will sell foreign exchange at the same market price as the Chinese legal tender (法幣) without restrictions. A reporter asked where this foreign exchange came from, and whether it would be obtained from customs through export licenses. If the bank can supply foreign exchange without restrictions, then it must be able to obtain unlimited quantities. The spokesperson said that there are no such restrictions at present. When asked whether the Japanese authorities would impose restrictions similar to those currently in place in North China if the public did not handle export documents through the bank and automatically supported it, the spokesperson replied that he was not in a position to discuss future matters.</p>
<p>The Bank's Capital is Entirely Legal Tender (法幣)</p>
<p>When asked whether the Hua Xing Commercial Bank had credit facilities established in London and New York, the counselor declined to answer. When asked whether the proposed paper money was supported by foreign currency or legal tender (法幣), or whether its capital was merely recorded on paper and had no substance, the counselor replied that the capital was in legal tender (法幣) and that the paper money would be issued on this basis and accepted at par. A reporter asked about a statement issued by Chen Jintao, the puppet "Minister of Finance" of the Reformed Government, who was appointed as the president of the Hua Xing Commercial Bank, regarding the claim that legal tender (法幣) in Nanjing was facing a crisis. The spokesperson agreed that legal tender (法幣) was unsound, but then admitted that the proposed paper money would be accepted at par with legal tender (法幣).</p>
<p>Capital Allocation is Half Japanese and Half Puppet</p>
<p>The spokesperson believed that the regulations of third-country banks would not hinder the new currency and stated that several foreign banks had agreed to handle the new currency. When asked to name these foreign banks, the counselor said that the list was not yet complete and that he did not wish to name them at present. According to the news released by Domei News Agency yesterday, the Hua Xing Commercial Bank recently held its inaugural meeting at the New Asia Hotel. Chen Jintao was appointed as the president of the bank, and Kijima Isoichi, the former director of the "Central Bank" of Manchuria in Changchun, was appointed as the vice president. The bank's capital will be "fully paid up," with the "Reformed Government" contributing 25 million yuan and six Japanese banks contributing the remainder.</p>
<p>Counterfeit Currency Cannot be Used to Pay Customs Duties</p>
<p>It was also stated that the bank's paper money will become the legal currency in the occupied areas, and will be accepted for formal payments and banking business. The only exception is that it cannot be used to pay customs duties. However, according to Chen's declaration, this restriction on the use of the new currency is "temporary." Although the Japanese counselor stated at yesterday's reception for reporters that the paper money issued by the new bank had strong support, there were clearly some doubts. The counselor also stated that the new currency was supported by legal tender (法幣), while Chen's declaration stated that the future of legal tender (法幣) was "truly unpredictable."</p>
<p>The United Reserve Bank's Miserable Failure is a Lesson from the Past</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the Sino-Japanese joint venture Hua Xing Commercial Bank held its inaugural meeting in Hongkou yesterday morning (the 1st). Foreign bankers who heard the bank's declared plans yesterday expressed distrust and surprise. According to a senior foreign banker who declined to be named, foreign banks, regardless of their position, are unwilling to even consider accepting and handling the paper money issued by this bank. The miserable failure of the United Reserve Bank is a lesson from the past, so this undertaking is truly a fantasy.</p>
<p>Exporters Decide Not to Cooperate</p>
<p>If the paper money is supported by foreign currency or legal tender (法幣), then speculators can control its fate, and such speculation will continue until the foreign currency support is exhausted. He did not believe for a moment that this paper money would be supported by foreign currency. If it is decided that this paper money will be the legal currency for paying customs duties, then importers will purchase it at a discount. He does not believe that the Japanese side has any possibility of forcing exporters to handle export documents through banks outside of Shanghai, and he expects that exporters will not go to this bank to obtain export facilities unless they are forced to do so.</p>
<p>Obtaining Loans is in Fact Difficult</p>
<p>Even if the Hua Xing Commercial Bank's paper money is supported by Japanese yen, it still cannot obtain credit loans overseas except through impossible conversions. The banker also said that Japan's finances are increasingly strained. For example, if any Japanese bank wants to obtain a credit loan in New York, it must deposit Japanese government bonds equal to 100% of the loan amount with the New York bank as collateral, and it must also deposit another 50% of the loan amount in foreign currency other than Japanese yen. This means that to obtain a loan of 100 yuan, you must have 150 yuan of collateral. The United Reserve Bank's experiment has now been severely taught a lesson. It is difficult to predict what the future holds for that bank, and it is incomprehensible that this new bank has been opened.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Again Suffers Bombing - Fierce Battle at Zhenhai</h3>
<p>Ningbo Residents Evacuate to the Countryside - Seven-Hour Battle at Zhenhai - The De Ping Has Returned to Shanghai - The Regularly Scheduled Route is Still Open</p>
<p>Ningbo was bombed again by Japanese aircraft on the 1st in the morning, resulting in over a hundred casualties. According to shipping industry sources, Japanese warships began shelling the Zhenhai Fortress at 7:00 AM yesterday. The garrison returned fire, leading to a fierce battle. The De Ping transport was blocked at Qilishih, and has since returned. The regularly scheduled route is still open. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ningbo City Again Suffers Bombing</p>
<p>The areas bombed in Ningbo on the 1st include Jiangdong Hui Street, Xinhe Si, Daxiao Chang, and the embankment west of Ling Bridge. Over a dozen bombs were dropped. After the bombing, a large fire spread, and it was not extinguished until after 2:00 PM. Over a hundred people were killed or injured in this attack, and over two hundred houses were destroyed. After being bombed twice, shops in Ningbo closed and residents evacuated to the countryside. Bodies are still being exhumed from the rubble.</p>
<p>Zhenhai Battle - Whereabouts of the De Ping</p>
<p>The De Ping transport of the Italian-Chinese Company, hired by the Ningbo Shanghai Association, transported a large quantity of medical supplies, doctors, nurses, etc., to Ningbo on the afternoon of the 29th to provide emergency assistance. The transport arrived at the waters of Qilishih outside Zhenhai Port at 7:00 AM yesterday. Due to the battle at Zhenhai Port, it was blocked and temporarily stopped moving forward. The ship reported everything to the Shanghai company by telegraph. At around 10:00 AM, Japanese soldiers boarded the De Ping transport for inspection, which lasted two hours. They prevented the ship from sailing to Ningbo. At the same time, the Italian-Chinese Company received a telegram from the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce stating that the Ningbo Defense Commander had ordered that no ships be allowed to enter Ningbo. The De Ping transport had not been specially approved in advance, so it was ordered to stop sailing into Ningbo. It immediately telegraphed the De Ping transport, ordering it to return to Shanghai, and instructed the ship to find a way to unload the medicine, transport it by lighter into the port, and then sail back. However, according to reporters, the medicine could not be unloaded until the afternoon. It is reported that the ship returned at 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon and arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning. Rumors of it being seized seem inaccurate. The Ningbo Association also announced, "The De Ping ship sailed to Ningbo yesterday. At 6:00 AM today, it arrived at Qilishih and encountered Japanese warships shelling. It was unable to enter the port, so it had to return to Shanghai. We will observe the situation and decide on a further course of action when it is possible to enter the port." The fierce battle at Zhenhai Port yesterday stopped at 12:30 PM. According to another report, the De Ping ship sailed to Qilishih outside Zhenhai Port at 5:00 AM yesterday. It suddenly encountered a Japanese warship, which prevented it from entering the port. Soldiers from the ship boarded the ship to inspect it, starting at 5:00 AM and ending at 7:00 AM, for a total of more than two hours. When they left, they said that the Japanese warships would soon be shelling and that it should quickly leave the dangerous area. Upon hearing this, the Ningbo Association immediately telegraphed the De Ping ship to return to Shanghai. The ship left Qilishih at 10:00 PM yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around 8:00 or 9:00 AM this morning.</p>
<p>Rumors that the German Ship Gordon Has Been Seized</p>
<p>After the Ningbo-Dinghai route was approved to resume, the Tianbao transport of the German shipowner Shi Yide Company first sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai on the 29th of last month. However, it was suddenly seized by Japanese warships in the waters of Luotou and forced to sail to Shanghai. As a result, the resumption of the route failed. Subsequently, the Gordon transport of the German shipowner Lu Lin Company continued to attempt the route. It sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai on the afternoon of the 30th. According to shipping industry sources yesterday, the transport was expected to arrive in Dinghai that night after leaving Ningbo. However, the company has not received a telegram from the ship. The company sent out a radio call, but there was no response. According to a boatman who was seized and arrived in Shanghai, the Gordon transport was seized by Japanese warships on the 1st in the waters of Jintang, Dinghai. This has been confirmed by telegrams from other transport companies. However, when inquiring with the shipping department of the Lu Lin Company, they said that the transport is currently docked in Dinghai and does not intend to resume the Ningbo-Dinghai route, and denied rumors of it being seized.</p>
<p>The Hana Sailed Directly to Dinghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Dinghai route has been closed for a long time, and various parties have requested its restoration one after another. Recently, the Ningbo Defense Command approved the resumption of the Hana and Haifu transports. The Hana transport of the German shipowner Yuan Dong Company immediately announced its sailing after receiving the telegram, sold passenger tickets, and loaded goods. It is reported that the transport left Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday and sailed to Dinghai. The Haifu transport of the German shipowner Li He Company is scheduled to sail to Dinghai on the 4th.</p>
<h3>The French Concession Taxpayers Association Hopes to Collect the National Flag</h3>
<p>After the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association retrieved the national flag from the French police, it sorted out 116 flags with street address numbers. On the 28th of last month, the association sent members to return the flags to each household. There were 110 flags without address numbers, and shops were notified to come to the association to claim them within a time limit. As of yesterday, 76 of the unmarked flags had been claimed by shops. There are still 34 flags that have not been claimed. As the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's assumption of the title of Extraordinary President on May 5th is approaching, the association decided yesterday to return the claimed national flags for the second time. It is hoped that all shops that have not claimed their flags will do so as soon as possible so that all citizens can hang them together and celebrate enthusiastically on the May 5th anniversary.</p>
<h3>After the Tianbao and Weijin Transports Were Seized, the German Consul-General Lodged a Protest with Japan</h3>
<p>The Tianbao Transport is Still Under Surveillance by Japanese Soldiers - The Whereabouts of the Weijin Transport are Unknown</p>
<p>The Dasheng transport of the German shipowner Shi Yide Company sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai on the 26th of last month. After being seized by Japanese warships in the waters of Luotoumen, it was forced to sail to Shanghai and docked on the Yangshupu River. It is still under surveillance by Japanese soldiers. The Weijin transport of the German shipowner Hengshi Company sailed from Shanghai to Fujian on the 30th of last month. After being seized in the waters of Haimen, the ship's radio was monitored and it was unable to report anything to Shanghai. It is unknown where it is currently being held. Now, the Shi Yide Company and the Hengshi Company have reported to the German Consul-General in Shanghai one after another. It is reported that the German Consul-General lodged a protest with Japan yesterday, demanding its prompt release and that similar actions not be taken in the future.</p>

<h3>Today is the Anniversary of the Jinan Incident - Various Organizations Telegraph Comfort to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>And Publish a Proclamation to Compatriots Encouraging All to Contribute</p>
<p>Today is the 11th anniversary of the Jinan Incident. Various organizations in the city have specially published a proclamation to all compatriots and telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express their deep respect. The excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Proclamation to Compatriots</p>
<p>(1) The Jinan Incident was a concrete manifestation of the aggressors' obstruction of the revolutionary forces' expansion. The occurrence of the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident was a concrete action by the aggressors to fundamentally destroy our revolutionary government. Therefore, in commemorating the Jinan Incident, we should more deeply understand that the enemy's plot against us has been premeditated for a long time. It is impossible to achieve national independence, freedom, and equality without thoroughly defeating the aggressors. Firmly maintaining the will to resist and supporting the national policy of resistance are the first essentials in commemorating the Jinan Incident today. (2) At the time of the Jinan Incident, our revolutionary forces had not yet unified the country. Supreme Leader Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, with foresight and vision, deeply believed that to defeat the brutal enemy, it was necessary to first strive for unification. Therefore, he advanced on the Northern Expedition to complete the great cause of unification. After nine years of suppressing rebels, recuperating, and learning lessons, we now have the great strength of national unity and sustained resistance. Therefore, in commemorating the Jinan Incident, our compatriots should pledge to support the leader to the death, absolutely obey the leader's command, and strive for final victory. (3) The compatriots in this city are holding on to this isolated island, enduring humiliation. However, the suffering they endure is not as great as the human tragedy suffered by the people in the occupied areas. Their contribution to the country is not as great as the sacrifice of flesh and blood by the soldiers at the front. Therefore, in commemorating the Jinan Incident, we should do our utmost to contribute our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to the great cause of resistance and reconstruction.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>To Chairman Chiang, Military Affairs Commission, Chongqing: Today, compatriots throughout the city deeply commemorate the 11th anniversary of the Jinan Incident. We deeply feel that the brutal enemy's plot against us has been long-standing. It is impossible to achieve our national independence, freedom, and equality without thoroughly defeating them. Recalling the past, Your Excellency advanced on the Northern Expedition to complete unification. After nine years of recuperation and learning lessons, we now have the great strength of sustained resistance. With profound thinking and foresight, Your Excellency determined the national plan for a hundred years, and with strategic planning, Your Excellency is trapping the brutal enemy in an inevitable defeat. Compatriots throughout the city are deeply grateful. Our belief in resistance to victory and reconstruction is strengthened. We pledge to use the strength of compatriots throughout the city to fight to the end for final victory. We respectfully send this telegram. Shanghai various agricultural, industrial, commercial, educational, cultural, and women's organizations respectfully kowtow.</p>
<h3>A Truck Was Intercepted Near Nanxiang</h3>
<p>Recently, guerrillas have been extremely active in the suburbs of Shanghai and along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. On the 25th of this month, two trucks of the Fuxin Transportation Company, loaded with over ten pieces of Japanese yarn and other miscellaneous goods, were traveling to Wuxi. After passing through Nanxiang, they were suddenly attacked and captured by guerrillas there. A certain merchant, taking advantage of the opportunity, fled to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>German Residents in Shanghai Celebrate National Day</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, German residents here celebrated German National Day yesterday (the 1st). The program of activities continued from morning to night. At 8:00 AM, the initial ceremony was held in the German church. A large number of German residents participated in the flag-raising ceremony. At 11:30 AM, German Consul-General Brachlow hosted foreign diplomats and representatives of various countries' troops at the German Garden General Assembly. From 2:30 PM, a grand sports meet and celebration were held at the German school on Daxi Road, which ended at 6:30 PM. Finally, all German residents gathered in the German Hall on Daxi Road at 7:00 PM for a German Congress.</p>
<h3>Fresh Pork Transported from Jiangbei to Shanghai Was Detained - Pork Merchants Decided Not to Submit</h3>
<p>The Puppet "Market" Arbitrarily Detained Over a Thousand Head - Japanese Carriers Should Bear Considerable Responsibility</p>
<p>The Fresh Pork Industry Association hosted a banquet for newspaper reporters the night before last. The association's standing committee members Xin Xiaokang and Li Zhenyu, executive committee member Gu Bao, and others were in attendance. During the banquet, Xin Xiaokang reported that the association had led all members of the city to sign a contract resolutely opposing the control of fresh pork sources and absolutely opposing those attempting to monopolize the Shanghai meat market. At the same time, he stated that the association led a joint declaration by all pork merchants, from the beginning, they understood the overall situation, and were willing to pay close attention to the association, and would not violate the meaning of the oath. As for the rumors about the association's mainstays Li Zhencai and Gu Bao, they were clearly a divisive tactic, intended to achieve the goal of defeating each group separately and fulfilling their ambitions of economic aggression. In the future, if you have any similar news about this matter, and want to investigate, the association is willing to answer truthfully, and will never protect anyone.</p>
<p>The Livestock Market Arbitrarily Detained Fresh Pork</p>
<p>Yesterday, the various pork businesses of Shanghai</p>
<p>found that over a thousand heads of fresh pork transported from Jiangbei on May 1st were arbitrarily detained by the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. The consignees have repeatedly negotiated with the carriers, Nissin Company and Jie Xing Company, but as of 6:00 PM last night, there had been no satisfactory result. It was also heard that the livestock market boasted that in the future, all fresh pork transported to Shanghai by Japanese ships would still be detained. The industry was quite saddened by this news and believes that: (1) The carrier should be responsible for not delivering the transported goods directly to the consignee. They decided to order the carrier to be responsible for delivery and declared that they reserved the right to claim compensation for any damages. (2) They believe that the livestock market's detention of other people's goods without cause not only infringes on their freedom to do business, but also clearly attempts to monopolize the fresh pork trade. (3) If the pork industry is controlled by them, then other beef, mutton, chicken, duck, and vegetables will also be monopolized. If that happens, the city's meat supply will be cut off. (4) If this kind of monopoly attempt gradually succeeds, then the entire economic structure of the city's pork merchants could easily collapse.</p>
<p>Pork Merchants Discussed Measures</p>
<p>In view of the above four reasons, the industry held an emergency meeting yesterday and decided: (1) They will uphold justice and fight to the end. They will never privately negotiate the extraction of the detained fresh pork. They would rather sacrifice their business than be forced to submit. (2) The loss of the price of the detained fresh pork suffered by each business will be borne by the public in the future. However, those who privately negotiate should be severely punished. (3) Under the circumstance that the goods are not under their control, all goods handled by each business in Jiangbei should be stopped. (4) The industry association will send letters to the Chinese members of the Public Concession Taxpayers Association and the Public Concession Board of Directors of the Public Concession and the French Concession, requesting relief to maintain the public interest.</p>
<p>Meat Businesses Refuse to Sell, Workers Refuse to Slaughter</p>
<p>Since the fresh meat business was "again monopolized" by a livestock market, the source of fresh pork has been lacking, resulting in soaring meat prices and huge losses. Therefore, they decided to refuse to buy goods from Hongkou, and the slaughter workers also decided to refuse to slaughter the pork sold by the livestock market. Since yesterday, the price of fresh pork in the markets of the two concessions has soared.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bank's Method of Returning Deposits Has Been Decided</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bank's deposit funds were previously approved by Mayor Yu to be transferred to the Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural Banks for continued funding. The four banks' head offices ordered the Shanghai branches of the four banks to formulate a method for approval. It is heard that the four banks' head offices have now approved several methods, as follows: (1) The Municipal Bank should earnestly urge the collection of loans. (2) Deposits should be paid according to the method of stabilizing finance. (3) The repayment of deposits should be handled by the Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee. Once the date is determined, it can be started.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Assistant Superintendent Being Beaten Has Been Lodged with a Firm Protest - Mrs. Li Li's Condition Is Gradually Improving - The Truth of the Car Accident Has Been Ascertained by the British Consulate</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the Public Concession Police Department's Assistant Superintendent Samson was beaten by a Japanese military officer in the Public Benefit Hospital on the evening of April 24th. The Police Department and the Municipal Council authorities immediately launched an investigation, closely questioning Samson himself and other witnesses. After ascertaining all the facts about this matter, they lodged a firm protest yesterday morning (the 1st). Samson was investigating the tragic death of Li Li, the principal of the Lester Industrial School, when he was struck in the face by a Japanese military officer in the reception hall of the Public Benefit Hospital. The British Consulate authorities are also fully aware of the circumstances of this traffic accident in Hongkou. However, the British Consul-General will not take any action until the Coroner's Court inquest is held. Mrs. Li Li and the Police Department's Western Inspector Visette were also injured in the car accident. Due to Mrs. Li Li's injuries, the British Coroner's Court in China has not yet determined the date for the continuation of the inquest into Li Li's death. However, it was confirmed yesterday that the injuries of Mrs. Li Li and Inspector Wei have slightly improved. Li Li's body was transferred to Hongen Hospital at the end of the week. Wei's injuries are still serious and he cannot be moved.</p>
<p>The British House of Commons is also Discussing This Case</p>
<p>Reuters reported from London on the 1st that the death of Dr. Li Li, the principal of the Lester Industrial School in Shanghai, in a car accident was discussed in the British House of Commons today. Undersecretary Butler said that the facts of this case were not clear and that the government could not decide on appropriate measures until a detailed investigation and statements from the injured Mrs. Li Li and Inspector Wimsett had been obtained. Conservative Party Member Moore asked if the British authorities had investigated the fact that the Japanese refused to allow Mrs. Sheffin to go to Hankou to see her husband. Butler replied that the Japanese authorities refused to issue Mrs. Sheffin a pass to Hankou and that the reasons were not yet known. This matter is still under investigation. Moore continued, "Is it not known that Sheffin is considered to be an anti-Japanese element, so his wife is refused permission to go there? Was it not Sheffin who helped clear the mines that had been placed by the Chinese army to block the advance of the Japanese army in Hankou? Does not this prove that the Japanese claim that Sheffin is an anti-Japanese element is completely unfounded?" Butler replied, "All these points must be considered during the continued investigation."</p>
<p>The Japanese View Blames Li Li</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that when the car accident occurred on April 24th, Li Li died, and a Japanese sentry was also seriously injured and died. It is reported that the Japanese Consul-General has lodged a protest with the British Consulate-General. According to the Japanese view, all the blame for the accident rests with the late Li Li. The British authorities will respond to this protest after obtaining an assessment of Li Li's death.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchant Groups: Encouraging the Cessation of Undisclosed Transactions</h3>
<p>Soybean and rice merchants convene regularly to discuss solutions. Merchants from various provinces articulate the difficulties of doing business.</p>
<p>Rice merchant groups in this city, concerned about the recent prevalence of undisclosed transactions in the rice and grain market, which blatantly contravene and exceed the established price limits, affecting the people's food supply, convened a special meeting on the fifth of this month to deliberate on thorough solutions. Market conditions yesterday morning showed a slight improvement compared to before. Furthermore, merchants from other provinces did not explicitly express concerns about raising prices. The following is a report from a "大光社" (Dà Guāng Shè) reporter detailing the situation:</p>
<p>Regular Meetings: Devising Sound Strategies</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of restricting rice prices, the Soybean and Rice Trade Association has repeatedly deliberated, emphasizing the maintenance of the maximum price limit of 14 yuan per picul. Despite repeated exhortations and requests that merchants from all regions jointly abide by this, formal transactions in the market have generally stabilized, but undisclosed transactions persist. This is a breach of commercial ethics among colleagues in the industry. Therefore, to eliminate these malpractices, clarify market prices, and devise a proper solution for a thorough resolution, the association has scheduled a joint meeting for 3 PM on the fifth of this month, inviting seven groups including the Rice Brokerage Association, Rice Milling Association, Changshu Rice Association, Rice Grain Distribution Association, Southern Province Association, and the United Rice Freighter Association to jointly deliberate.</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning: Dispatching Representatives to Exhort Merchants</p>
<p>Since the superior white polished rice and "羊尖客秈" (Yángjiān Kèxiān) rice surpassed the price limits in undisclosed transactions, market conditions have reverted to a chaotic state. The Rice Grain Evaluation Committee believes that failure to eliminate ingrained habits will have far-reaching consequences, not only impacting normal transactions but also posing significant harm to the future of the people's food supply. Therefore, they specifically dispatched committee members 符前耕 (Fú Qiángēng), 石祖福 (Shí Zǔfú), 嚴際雲 (Yán Jìyún), and 潘櫃斌 (Pān Guìbīn) as four representatives. At the market opening at 9 AM yesterday morning, they earnestly exhorted merchants from all provinces and colleagues in the trade. Before the market closed, they invited key figures from various provincial merchant groups to discuss and gather opinions, to be presented in a report at the meeting on the fifth.</p>
<p>Expressing Difficulties: Hoping for Price Flexibility</p>
<p>The rice market situation yesterday morning was relatively stable, with all types of rice and grain trading within the price limits. According to inquiries made by the "大光社" (Dà Guāng Shè) reporter with merchants from various provinces, they generally stated the following difficulties: (1) limited reserves in the interior with soaring market prices; (2) rampant extortion and heavy taxation by the puppet regime; (3) frequent incidents of dangerous transportation and sales journeys, sometimes even resulting in the total loss of capital; Even when rice and grain are transported to Shanghai for trading, the profit is small in relation to the investment, and sometimes losses are incurred due to unfavorable timing. Therefore, they unanimously hope that the authorities will allow for price flexibility to alleviate the livelihood difficulties of the merchants.</p>
<h3>Both Wharves at the 新港 (Xīngǎng) Port Controlled; Small-Scale Transportation Intercepted; Goods Confiscated, Passengers Detained</h3>
<p>江北 (Jiāngběi) 新港 (Xīngǎng) port is now a central location for the export of native products from northern 江蘇 (Jiāngsū). Consequently, more than ten ships operate between this city and that port. The business is thriving. Goods transported year-round are mostly pigs, chickens, ducks, and fresh eggs. In the autumn, there is cotton, and in the summer, wheat. There are also items like cowhide and pig bristles. Since cotton and cowhide were placed under control last autumn, the shipping industry has declined. It now entirely relies on the loading of pigs. Recently, however, even pigs have come under control. Furthermore, numerous small transport ships and barges are dispatched to intercept goods at various ports. If merchants are unwilling to load onto the small ships, they are illegally detained and subjected to various forms of harassment. Passengers also encounter the same situation. If they do not travel on the designated ships, they are subjected to cruel searches. Regardless of gender, their upper and lower garments are stripped off in public. As a result, they are then prevented from boarding the ships under various pretexts. Those coming from that area express constant complaints. The various transport ships operating in that area also have no goods to load. A certain transport ship that arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon waited for two days in 新港 (Xīngǎng) and only managed to load about a dozen miscellaneous items. It is said that the shipping operations at both ports will likely be entirely monopolized in the future.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Squad Executes Bandits</h3>
<p>The guerrilla squad stationed in 七寶鎭 (Qībǎo Zhèn) of western Shanghai, led by 姚友蓮 (Yáo Yǒulián), apprehended three bandits near No. 5 Bridge on 青滬 (Qīnghù) Road at around 1 PM the day before yesterday: 陶海根 (Táo Hǎigēn), aged 34, a vagrant from the southern 虹橋 (Hóngqiáo) area; 張關明 (Zhāng Guānmíng), aged 26; and 楊金生 (Yáng Jīnshēng), aged 24. They were immediately taken back to the squad headquarters for interrogation, and after confirming their guilt, the three criminals were escorted to the 義冡 (Yì Mǒng) area north of 七寶鎭 (Qībǎo Zhèn) and executed by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Re-registration Approved: The China Press to Resume Publication; Municipal Council Did Not Order Suspension; Temporary Revocation of Registration Due to Misunderstanding; Publication to Resume as Usual Today After Explanation</h3>
<p>The China Press published an article on the 28th of last month, the content of which had a tendency to undermine public order. As a result, the Municipal Council revoked the newspaper's registration on the first of this month. Today (the 2nd), the newspaper did not publish. A newspaper must cease publication once its registration is revoked. The publisher of the newspaper has now submitted a written guarantee to the Municipal Council, promising that it will no longer publish similar articles in the future and will strictly adhere to the regulations of the Police Department. According to the publisher, the article was disclosed due to momentary oversight, which he deeply regrets. The Municipal Council, given the newspaper's guarantee, has approved its re-registration.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspaper Report</p>
<p>The English-language "大美晚報" (Dà Měi Wǎnbào) reports that rumors that an American-owned Chinese-language newspaper has been ordered to cease publication by the Public Concession Police are inaccurate. The Police Department took action last week after warning all foreign-owned Chinese-language newspapers, and the registration certificate of the American-owned newspaper was revoked. The newspaper in question is The China Press, published by Mills. Mills submitted the registration certificate to the Police Department yesterday (the 1st). According to him, the Police Department took this action because the newspaper used the terms "traitor" and "slave" when referring to pro-Japanese Chinese individuals. After the Japanese side protested to the Municipal Council, the Police Department warned against the excessive use of such terms. Mills further told reporters that the Police Department's action yesterday evening did not allow him time to discuss the matter with the US Consulate. However, he stated that the matter was not significant, as the newspaper's staff were on holiday yesterday and the newspaper was not scheduled for publication today. Mills plans to appeal to the Police Department and the US Consulate today. It has also been learned that the Police Department requested that Mills personally return the newspaper's registration certificate to the Main Police Station yesterday, and Mills complied without attempting to argue with or obstruct the Police Department. It is widely believed that the Municipal Council's decision to suspend The China Press was triggered by an article published in the newspaper on April 28, which advocated for the execution of all traitors.</p>

<h3>Seizing Central China Railway, Disregarding Debt; Accepting Rights Without Accepting Obligations; Japanese Spokesperson Gives No Clear Answer</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that at a press conference hosted by the Japanese yesterday (1st), a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy said that since the establishment of the Sino-Japanese joint venture company managing 800 kilometers of the Central China Railway was announced last week, would the "Reformed Government" be responsible for repaying loans secured by the railway's revenue? The spokesperson replied that Nanjing cannot be responsible for debts borrowed by Chongqing. It is noted that over half of the railway revenue of the railway lines that the new company, affiliated with the Central China Development Company, intends to acquire is pledged as collateral for British loans to China. However, the progress of Japanese military aggression in China over the past two years has not only deprived bondholders of their funds but has also completely deprived them of the right to manage and maintain these railway lines. According to the Japanese military authorities, they did so "due to military necessities." Yesterday, the Japanese side claimed that the new Sino-Japanese joint venture company held its inaugural meeting at the New Asia Hotel on Sunday and would manage the 京滬 (Jīnghù), 京蕪 (Jīngwú), 蘇嘉 (Sūjiā), and 淞滬 (Sōnghù) lines. At yesterday's press conference, when discussing the acquisition of these railways, a reporter asked if it was rare for a company to acquire another company's assets without also assuming its obligations. The spokesperson replied that he was unaware of any such regulations in international law. Another reporter asked if this meant that the "Reformed Government" would refuse to pay all of China's foreign debts. The spokesperson replied that the "Reformed Government's" failure to pay railway loans did not mean a refusal to pay all debts. A reporter asked if this was an evasive response. The spokesperson did not answer, but then replied to another question by saying that the issue of repaying China's debts could not be decided solely by Nanjing. It has been learned that details of the seizure of railways related to British investors have been sent to the British Embassy and the Foreign Office. Bondholder representatives have lodged strong protests. According to yesterday's announcement, 亩诚 (Tián Chéng), former chief of the Railway Department of the Japanese Ministry of Railways, will head this new company. The company was established with the permission of the "Reformed Government."</p>
<h3>Rising Raw Material Costs, Flour Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Due to poor harvests in overseas wheat markets, such as Canada and Australia, coupled with volatile international conditions and a focus on internal stability, especially the thorough preparations and storage of military supplies as a contingency plan, wheat prices have been rising frequently. Flour prices in this city have also been affected by fluctuations in the international market. In addition, sales through 北洋 (Běiyáng) merchant channels are more active than before, leading to a steep increase in imports, with prices rising to 4.6 yuan per bag. At present, the flour mills have limited raw materials on hand, and imported wheat ordered from overseas has not yet arrived. It is expected that market prices will continue to rise after this wave, with no prospect of decline.</p>
<h3>US Warship Departs Shanghai</h3>
<p>Two British Warships Arrive Here Today from Hankou</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the US warship Astoria, which transported the ashes of the former US Ambassador to Japan back to Japan, departed Shanghai yesterday (the 1st) afternoon, heading to the US West Coast via Hong Kong, Manila, and Honolulu. The cruiser was docked in Shanghai for only forty-eight hours and will only make brief stops at other ports in the East. Given the long voyage from Manila to Hawaii, the ship may dock in Honolulu for a longer period.</p>
<p>The China Press reports that the British warships Scorpion and Cricket, flying the flag of Rear Admiral 贺特 (Hè Tè), will arrive in Shanghai from Hankou at around noon tomorrow (the 3rd). The two ships are carrying several foreigners from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Concession Authorities Indicate Unwillingness to Prohibit Residents from Flying Flags; However, Various Groups Agree to Fly Flags for Eight Days Each Year Out of Consideration for the Environment; Further Negotiations on Other Commemorative Days Pending with the Foreign Ministry</h3>
<p>Since the dispute over flying flags within the concessions arose, the relevant groups have been negotiating with the concession authorities on one hand and discussing solutions on the other. It is now learned that the attitude of the concession authorities is quite clear: based on any legal principle, the concession authorities are unwilling to prohibit residents within the concessions from flying flags of internationally recognized countries. However, if there are flags with a political demonstration character, the authorities, to maintain order and avoid disputes, are willing to make every effort to persuade against such actions. The Shanghai Municipal Council's response to the request from the Japanese Consul General 三浦 (Sānpǔ) to prohibit the flying of the 青天白日 (Qīngtiān Báirì) flag is also phrased in these terms. The groups involved find the attitude of the concession authorities appropriate. Out of consideration for the overall environment, they have jointly agreed that flags should be flown on the following occasions: (1) National Day of the National Government; (2) Commemoration of the Birthday and Death Anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (3) Martyrs' Memorial Day; (4) Confucius' Birthday, to express the spirit of national progress and respect for the royal way and the rejection of barbarian ways. Based on this, flags will be flown for a total of eight days per year: January 1, March 12, March 29, May 5, July 1, August 27, October 10, and November 12. As for National Humiliation Memorial Days related to the Japanese, the groups believe that since the nation is currently at war, the humiliation will inevitably be wiped away on the day of victory after the war. Therefore, there will be no temporary half-masting of flags. Meanwhile, they will await the results of negotiations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing with the British and French ambassadors before taking further action. In the future, whenever flag-flying is agreed upon, an announcement will be made in the newspapers one day in advance, and all shops in the city should raise flags uniformly to show a united spirit. The Public Concession and the French Concession will follow the same procedure.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council String Concert</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Orchestra is scheduled to hold a "String Concert" at the 藺心 (Lìnxīn) Theatre at 5:15 PM on the 7th of this month (Sunday). The program includes five items. Ticket prices remain the same.</p>
<h3>Searching for 徐交元 (Xú Jiāoyuán)</h3>
<p>徐文元 (Xú Wényuán), from 青浦 (Qīngpǔ), is 24 years old and used to work in Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the August 13th incident two years ago, he has not been in contact with his family. If any relatives, friends, or classmates know of his whereabouts, please inform 徐忍百 (Xú Rěnbǎi), care of Lawyer 汪汝枚 (Wāng Rǔméi), No. 57 賢成 (Xiánchéng) Lane, Labor 神父 (Shénfù)踏東口 (Tà Dōngkǒu), French Concession, so that the family can be reunited.</p>
<h3>Silk Store Manager Accused of Breach of Trust and Embezzlement; Refusing to Allow Audit by Aunt; Ordered to Submit Account Books for Review</h3>
<p>The late 邱達生 (Qiū Dáchēng), a native of 南匯 (Nánhuì), co-invested with his brother-in-law 王仲林 (Wáng Zhōnglín) to open the 大章 (Dà Zhāng) Silk Store on 北門 (Běimén) Main Street in 南匯 (Nánhuì), with 王 (Wáng) acting as manager. Since the outbreak of the war, 南匯 (Nánhuì) was once occupied. 邱 (Qiū) and 王 (Wáng) managed to transport the store's goods to Shanghai, renting No. 55 和樂 (Hélè) Textile Mill, 西愛威斯 (Xī Àiwēisī) Road, 拉都 (Lādū) Road, in the Concession to continue business. After 邱達生 (Qiū Dáchēng) died of illness on New Year's Day this year, 王仲林 (Wáng Zhōnglín) bullied his aunt, 邱王氏 (Qiū Wángshì), a woman, refusing to allow auditing and inventory of the stock. 邱王氏 (Qiū Wángshì) then appointed a lawyer to negotiate with 王仲林 (Wáng Zhōnglín), who finally handed over fifteen account books. After inspection, it was found that the account books were incomplete, and 王 (Wáng) was found to have engaged in breach of trust and embezzlement. 邱王氏 (Qiū Wángshì) then commissioned Lawyer 孟起 (Mèng Qǐ) to file a suit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing 王仲林 (Wáng Zhōnglín) of breach of trust and embezzlement, requesting legal prosecution, and also seeking a civil ruling to order the surrender of the accounts for investigation. The court accepted the case and held a hearing to summon the defendant. Due to the defendant's absence, the hearing was adjourned. These details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, a continued hearing was held. Both sides were represented by lawyers. The defendant's lawyer first raised the issue of jurisdiction, and then the plaintiff's lawyer stated the intent of the lawsuit. The plaintiff is only suing for the period from the move to the French Concession until October of the 27th year, during which the defendant was found to have committed embezzlement, including the cost of clothing used for the defendant's mother's funeral and the two transactions with 天泰祥 (Tiāntàixiáng), all of which were not recorded in the accounts. The plaintiff requested an investigation. The defendant claimed that all items were recorded in the accounts, that the 1,500 yuan from 天泰祥 (Tiāntàixiáng) was recorded in a separate account book that was at home and not brought to court, and that the expenses for his mother's funeral were also recorded by the accountant. The court asked the plaintiff to point out the temporary accounts submitted as evidence, but she was unable to do so. The plaintiff's lawyer further stated that after the previous hearing, the defendant used a太平 (Tàipíng) Moving Company truck to transport goods to a location beyond the concession road, but was fortunately stopped by the second landlord. Today, the plaintiff requested that the defendant be released on bail. After the lawyers for both sides presented their arguments, the court adjourned the hearing for ten days, ordered the defendant to pay a deposit of 500 yuan, or be detained, and ordered that the account books be submitted to the court at the next hearing.</p>
<h3>Fake "Detective" Extorts Money; Two Offenders Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment Each</h3>
<p>育仁 (Yù Rén), a native of 湖南 (Húnán), previously worked at the 淞滬 (Sōnghù) Garrison Headquarters. After the outbreak of the war, he defected and took a position as a detective in the China Secret Service Department of the 金谷 (Jīngǔ) Special High Command of the Japanese Army. From then on, he acted as a lackey of the Japanese, committing all sorts of evil deeds and engaging in extortion under the guise of his position. On the 23rd of last month, 育仁 (Yù Rén), together with 徐承發 (Xú Chéngfā), a native of 南京 (Nánjīng), went to the 三泰 (Sān Tài) Hotel at No. 484 九江 (Jiǔjiāng) Road, claiming that the hotel was selling counterfeit "passes." The situation was tense, and they insisted on taking the person in charge of the hotel to the Japanese Headquarters in 虹口 (Hóngkǒu). Although the hotel staff denied the allegations, 育仁 (Yù Rén) remained unconvinced. As a result, they searched the cash register and took all ten yuan in 法幣 (Fǎbì). The next day, 育仁 (Yù Rén) and 徐 (Xú) returned, intending to continue their extortion for a larger sum of money. The 三泰 (Sān Tài) authorities reported the matter to the 老鬧 (Lǎo Nào) Police Station. Detectives 孫大發 (Sūn Dàfā) and 陳瑞生 (Chén Ruìshēng) apprehended 育仁 (Yù Rén) and 徐 (Xú) and handed them over to the First Special District Court for detention. Yesterday morning, the case was continued by 蕭燮棻 (Xiāo Xièfēn), with 周靜 (Zhōu Jìng) serving as the clerk. The Police Station's lawyer, 汝葆 (Rǔ Bǎo), argued that the defendants had extorted money by falsely claiming to have special authority. Although the amount extorted was only ten yuan, their malicious intent was deep and unforgivable, and they should be punished severely according to the law. The defendants also hired lawyer 張驥 (Zhāng Jì) to defend them, arguing that 育仁 (Yù Rén), although serving in the Japanese agency, was actually working for the central government, investigating Japanese secrets. The incident was simply a result of two of his subordinates purchasing a counterfeit "pass" from the 三泰 (Sān Tài) Hotel and being detained by the Japanese military. There was no extortion involved. The lawyer requested a verdict of not guilty. After Judge 蕭 (Xiāo) interrogated the defendant 育仁 (Yù Rén), he announced the verdict, sentencing 育仁 (Yù Rén) and 徐永發 (Xú Yǒngfā) to one year of imprisonment each as a warning.</p>
<h3>Gambling Losses Lead to Embezzlement of Funds</h3>
<p>孔繁程 (Kǒng Fánchéng), a native of 寧波 (Níngbō), was employed as a clerk at the Japanese 光友 (Guāngyǒu) 洋行 at No. 190 北京 (Běijīng) Road. Recently, due to gambling losses in various gambling dens in western Shanghai, he developed the intention to embezzle funds. He falsely claimed that customers who paid in cash at the store, such as the 麗都 (Lìdū), 海陸 (Hǎilù), 達爾美 (Dáěrměi), 直如 (Zhírú), 明星 (Míngxīng), 薔薇 (Qiángwēi), and 陳雲記 (Chén Yúnjì) photo studios, were actually credit customers who would pay at the end of the month. At the end of last month, the manager noticed that the amounts paid in cash by the aforementioned photo studios, all of which had been embezzled by 孔 (Kǒng), were falsely recorded as credit payments. The total amount embezzled was 234 yuan, 3 jiao, and 8 fen. The matter was reported to the Central Police Station, and detective 宋元善 (Sòng Yuánshàn) arrested 孔 (Kǒng). Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The Police Station's lawyer, 汝葆 (Rǔ Bǎo), prosecuted him for embezzlement in the course of business. Since the accounts of the plaintiff had not yet been fully investigated, he requested an adjournment. 孔 (Kǒng) also confessed to the crime. After Judge 蕭 (Xiāo) verified the confession, he ordered 孔 (Kǒng) to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing for one week.</p>
<h3>Reckless Driving Results in One Year and Six Months of Imprisonment; Civil Suit Transferred to Civil Division for Adjudication</h3>
<p>董以禮 (Dǒng Yǐlǐ), a native of 南通 (Nántōng) and a driver for the Public Concession Bureau of Revenue, was driving Bureau of Revenue vehicle No. 8864 at around 12:20 PM on the 17th of last month. While driving on 古拔 (Gǔbá) Road in the French Concession, his careless driving resulted in the death of 周錫 (Zhōu Xī), the nine-year-old only son of 周盛利 (Zhōu Shènglì), a native of 舟山 (Zhōushān). The boy's legs were broken, his abdomen ruptured, and his intestines spilled out, resulting in immediate death. The Police Station detained 董 (Dǒng) and handed him over to the Second Special District Court for prosecution according to the law. The victim's father filed an ancillary civil suit seeking damages of 6,000 yuan. The case has been adjudicated by Judge 廖 (Liào), and the judgment was announced the day before yesterday afternoon. 董以禮 (Dǒng Yǐlǐ) was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for causing death due to negligence in the course of business. The ancillary civil suit was transferred to the Civil Division for adjudication.</p>

<h3>法幣 (Fǎbì) Found During Search for Opium, Discrepancy in Amount Reported; Sixty Opium Balls Found, Amount of Money to Be Verified Before Further Questioning</h3>
<p>The French Police received a tip-off the day before yesterday that someone was selling opium at No. 295 維爾蒙 (Wéiěrméng) Road. Accordingly, at 3 PM the day before yesterday, Western Detective 拉賓 (Lābīn) (transliteration) and three Chinese detectives went to the address to search. They arrested 潘虎福 (Pān Hǔfú), aged 29, from 蘇州 (Sūzhōu), and 潘 (Pān)'s nephew 金泉根 (Jīn Quángēn), aged 21. They found sixty opium balls hidden in a thermos flask shell and twenty-six yuan and several jiao of banknotes in a drawer. They also found 法幣 (Fǎbì) 585 yuan in a leather suitcase, which was all taken to the Police Station. Yesterday afternoon, they were handed over to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, where Judge 繆慶邦 (Miào Qìngbāng) interrogated them. Yuan Jiahan, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Bureau, stated the case and filed charges according to the law. The detectives presented the evidence and reported the course of the search. 王士宗 (Wáng Shìzōng), the lawyer for the defendants, declared in court that when detectives were searching the defendants' home, without waiting for the keys, they broke the lock of the suitcase. According to reports, there is a discrepancy in the amount of cash found. The actual amount was 1,100 yuan. One packet was for 潘 (Pān)'s mother-in-law's future funeral expenses, and another packet contained 360 yuan. The amount now reported differs by more than 800 yuan. The lawyer requested that the investigating detectives pay attention to this discrepancy. During the questioning, 潘虎福 (Pān Hǔfú) testified, "I don't smoke opium, and I don't sell it. The opium balls found were smoked by my mother-in-law. She has returned to 蘇州 (Sūzhōu). The 1,100 yuan belongs to her. We brought it to Shanghai because of the trouble with the guerrillas in the countryside. When the detectives came to search, they first handcuffed me and 泉根 (Quángēn), ordered us to kneel beside them, and drove my wife out of the room. They broke open the suitcase, and searched through it, like robbers." Later, the court found that the receipt for evidence listed 106 yuan and 2 jiao in cash. When questioned about this, the detectives said that they did not find that amount. They only found twenty-six yuan and four jiao, which they turned over. Another 585 yuan was listed in the French receipt, and Western Detective 拉賓 (Lābīn) was summoned to the stand. According to the translation of his report, when they searched the defendant's home, they found sixty opium balls in a thermos flask shell. In a drawer, they found twenty-six yuan and four jiao in banknotes, which they believed the defendant had earned from selling opium. They turned these over. They found 585 yuan in a suitcase, which they believed belonged to the defendant personally, and they stored it in the Police Station without turning it over. There was no mention of an additional 206 yuan and 2 jiao. After reviewing the testimony, the court ordered the Police Station to clarify the amount of money and adjourned the hearing to this Saturday. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Apprentice from Earth Products Store Arrested, Carrying Opium Intercepted</p>
<p>泰興 (Tàixīng) Earth Products Store, located at No. 6 白利南 (Báilìnán) Road, dispatched 羊志英 (Yáng Zhìyīng), an apprentice from 清江 (Qīngjiāng), to deliver eight pounds of opium to 二馬 (Èrmǎ) Road at approximately 5 PM yesterday. He hired a 雲飛 (Yúnfēi) taxi to travel along 極司非而 (Jísīfēiér) Road to the 开纳 (Kāinà) Road intersection. 静安寺 (Jìng'ānsì) Police Station detectives 崔步雲 (Cuī Bùyún) and Officer No. 1285 stopped 羊 (Yáng) and seized the opium. He was taken to the Police Station and escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The defendant hired 余祥零 (Yú Xiánglíng) as his lawyer. After questioning by Judge 蕭 (Xiāo), the defendant was ordered to be detained and the hearing was adjourned for seven days.</p>
<h3>Large Gambling Den Established on 海格 (Hǎigé) Road in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Funded by Gambling Bosses from Western Shanghai; Grand Scale; Officially Opens Today</p>
<p>In the area of western Shanghai beyond the concession limits, there are many gambling dens, no fewer than dozens, large and small, harming the people, no different from floods and wild beasts. Recently, several gambling bosses from western Shanghai have pooled funds amounting to several million yuan to open a very large gambling den at No. 368 near 海格 (Hǎigé) Road and 善鐘 (Shànzhōng) Road in western Shanghai. It is named "亦廬 (Yìlú)." The magnificent building is luxurious and splendid, with over ninety types of games, including 搖攤 (Yáotān), 輸盤 (Shūpán), and 牌九 (Pái Jiǔ). It also has secret rooms for people to smoke opium. The entrance is heavily guarded. Gamblers must possess a card issued by the gambling den to enter. Every day, there are many gamblers, and the amount won or lost is in the tens of thousands. It is said that the gambling den has set May 3 (today) as its official opening date, widely soliciting customers and enticing people to gamble.</p>
<h3>Women's Unbecoming Conduct</h3>
<p>Pregnant from Adultery Before Marriage: Husband Petitions for Divorce Mediation Without Success</p>
<p>Li Changfa, a 23-year-old Zhejiang native residing at No. 8 Yuqing Lane, Balizhuang Street, outside Xiaobeimen in the French Concession, recently engaged lawyer Gong Chuyin to file a petition for divorce mediation in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court against his wife, Hu Yinfeng, a 22-year-old Ningbo native residing at No. 38 Puxianfang, Kaifeng Road, North Zhejiang Road.</p>
<p>Mediation for Divorce</p>
<p>The petition stated that last year, through the introduction of Zheng Dongshan and Wang Zaiqing, he became engaged to Hu Anlin's daughter, the defendant. They married and began cohabiting on September 28th of the same year. After a few days, he noticed the defendant was restless, often appearing sleepy, seemingly ill but not, with inconsistent eating habits, and experiencing bodily changes, including enlarged breasts and</p>
<p>A Swollen Abdomen</p>
<p>showing signs of being several months pregnant. When questioned, she was evasive, often making excuses to return to Ningbo and not coming home at night. When pressed, she would reply that her personal actions were her own business and no one could interfere. This behavior clearly demonstrated conduct unbecoming of a wife, with evidence of adultery and conception occurring after the engagement but before the marriage. To prevent exposure, she took advantage of the petitioner's absence on the afternoon of December 19th at 5:00 PM and</p>
<p>Made off with All Jewelry</p>
<p>clothing, and suitcases, fleeing the home. When sought at her mother's house, she avoided meeting. Her father initially claimed ignorance, stating she would return in three or four months. The reason for this was undoubtedly to conceal the evidence of her pregnancy occurring after the engagement but before the marriage. Although the petitioner is a small businessman, his reputation is at stake, leaving him no choice but to petition for divorce mediation.</p>
<p>The court, upon receiving the petition,</p>
<p>held a hearing for mediation on the morning of the previous day. The defendant, Hu Yinfeng, did not appear, only the petitioner was present. The court, due to the defendant's absence, could not proceed with mediation and declared the mediation unsuccessful, advising the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Fire on Robison Road</h3>
<p>Fake Fire Truck Causes Accident: Woman's Leg Bone Crushed</p>
<p>A fire broke out yesterday at approximately 4:33 PM at No. 1885 Robison Road in the Western District of Shanghai, spreading to neighboring houses at Nos. 1884, 1887, and 1888. The fire was eventually extinguished by the Fire Department after two hours of dousing. The fire resulted in the destruction of several houses. As the area was part of an extra-settlement road, a fake fire truck from a "municipal" fire brigade also rushed to the scene to assist during the fire. After the fire was extinguished, the truck was returning when it collided with a fully loaded truck at the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Binlang Road. The collision resulted in six people, including firefighters, men, and women, falling into the river ditch beside the road, their clothes soaked. One woman had her leg bone crushed, leaving her disabled, while the others sustained minor injuries. Patrol officers arrived and summoned ambulances to transport the injured to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Payment Arrest</h3>
<p>Lan Caizhi, a 42-year-old Cantonese, the director of the business department of Fu'an Department Store at No. 8 Jing'an Temple Road, last month on the 28th, Ye Rongfang, the manager of Xianghe Cigarette and Paper Shop on Xiafei Road, sent Shen Yinqin, to contact Lan to order two cases of "San Pao Li" cigarettes, worth 446 yuan. At the time, 346 yuan was paid in advance, with the remaining 100 yuan to be paid upon delivery. However, two days passed, and the goods had not arrived. Xianghe inquired with Lan, who initially claimed that the goods could not be delivered because the balance had not been paid. Later, he admitted that he had lost the money gambling at Caojiadu. Xianghe Cigarette and Paper Shop reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Detective Li Yinmin to arrest Lan Caizhi. It was discovered that Lan had also embezzled 912 yuan from Qiantai Cigarette and Paper Shop on Xinzha Road using the same method. Yesterday morning, Lan was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and presented the case. Subsequently, representatives from Xianghe and Qiantai submitted their complaints. When questioned, Lan Caizhi admitted to losing the money gambling. Judge Xiao instructed the defendant to be detained for a further hearing in seven days.</p>

<p>Wang Atu: At 9:00 AM yesterday, the "Kuai Da" ferry of the British Taikoo Steamer Company, carrying passengers from the company's pier in Pudong, was crossing the Huangpu River. Suddenly, a passenger jumped into the river. Fortunately, he was rescued by nearby boatmen and taken to the Maritime Customs Police Station. He identified himself as Wang Atu, 23 years old, from Ningbo, who worked in a lumberyard. Because he wanted to marry a woman with the surname of a particular family, but his mother was strongly opposed, he felt a lack of freedom in marriage and became despondent and厌世.</p>
<h3>Qingyu Lane Eviction Case: Tenants Telegraph the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Please Order the Banking and Real Estate Associations to Stop Landlords from Forcibly Evicting Tenants Under the Pretext of Renovation</p>
<p>Regarding the eviction case of over 3,000 tenants in Qingyu Lane on Xin Chongqing Road in Shanghai, the tenant representatives, in addition to petitioning the Chinese directors and appealing to various organizations and groups for assistance, also telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting effective relief. The original telegram read: "To Premier Kong of the Executive Yuan: The houses in Qingyu Lane on Xin Chongqing Road in Shanghai are owned by the Poor Children's Education Institute and leased by the Shannvzi (Women's) Bank. With the westward shift of the war, refugees from the southeastern provinces have gathered in Shanghai, causing a housing shortage. The bank, under the pretext of 'meeting the needs of the times,' is renovating the houses and forcibly evicting the tenants. Despite repeated pleas from the tenants and a voluntary offer to increase the rent by 50%, the bank remains firm in its refusal and uses the law to suppress them, causing over 3,000 tenants to face the misery of homelessness. Most of us are refugees who risked our lives to escape from guerrilla areas to Shanghai, trying to salvage the remains and barely survive. How can we endure the suffering of displacement again? The bank is taking advantage of the situation to seek profits, disregarding social stability and the nation's vitality. The tenants have no recourse and are forced to request that Your Excellency promptly order the Shanghai Banking and Real Estate Associations to inform landlords and rental agencies not to forcibly evict tenants under the pretext of renovation, so as to appease the displaced and protect the people's strength. We await your urgent order." It is reported that the Women's Bank has already started renting under the name "Shuntian Village" and has begun cutting off water and electricity.</p>

<p>Comedy Turns Tragedy</p>
<h3>Collapse of Housing in Nantao Refugee Area: Over Sixty Casualties; Bride Yu Yunxia Dies on the Spot, Groom Weng Youli Seriously Injured; A Total of Twenty-One Killed and Forty-Four Injured on the Spot</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a tragic housing collapse occurred in the refugee area of Nantao, with a total of eighteen people killed and forty-two slightly injured, as well as two people heavily wounded. After the incident, Father Jiao, the Director General of the Refugee Area, and Chief Gu Lun, both arrived at the scene to offer condolences. Here are the detailed reports obtained by the News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Wedding Ceremony Held in Refugee Area</p>
<p>Nos. 146 and 148 Luxiangyuan Road, Nantao Refugee Area, were originally the Fuxingyuan Restaurant opened by Ding Mou before the war. Later it was closed during the war, and Ding Mou remained in the premises. Then, Weng A Xiao (also known as Weng Youli, 26 years old), a Ningbo native who worked as a shop assistant at Shunsheng Meat Store on Dajing Road, was engaged to the daughter of Yu Mou, a resident of the area, Yu Yunxia (also known as Xiaomei), as his wife. The wedding was scheduled for yesterday. As Weng’s home, and Yu’s family home, were both in the refugee area, it was inconvenient to hold the wedding in the Concession. Therefore, Weng consulted with Ding Mou and borrowed Ding's old restaurant hall to hold the wedding. Ding Mou was friendly with Weng, so he agreed to Weng’s request.</p>
<p>Guests Gather, House Collapses Suddenly</p>
<p>At 2:05 PM yesterday, just as guests were gathered, and the bride and groom were proceeding with the wedding ceremony, the inhabitants of the refugee area had not witnessed such a grand event for a long time. So, the neighbors flocked to watch, to get a glimpse of the bride and groom. Unexpectedly, because of the large number of people, the house suddenly collapsed. With a crash, the two houses completely collapsed, causing the people to be crushed under the fallen beams and debris, and no one had a chance to escape. The sounds of crying and wailing were deafening, a truly tragic sight. After the incident, Father Jiao and Chief Gu Lun of the Refugee Area Office heard the news and immediately rushed to the scene to take care of the situation. They also sent personnel to maintain order. The Nantao Fire Department mobilized all personnel to rescue the dead and injured. At the same time, the puppet detective team dispatched pseudo-leader Lu Mou and pseudo-officers to investigate.</p>
<p>Bride Dies Tragically, Groom Seriously Injured</p>
<p>After investigation, it was determined that a total of twenty-one people had been killed on the spot. Apart from the bride, Yu Yunxia (17 years old, from Suzhou), the names of the other deceased had not yet been determined. In addition, the groom Weng A Xiao and one guest were seriously injured, and forty-two people were slightly injured. All the deceased were taken by the Fushuntang burial team for burial. The injured were all sent to the Islamic Hospital in the Glass Public Institute on Qinglian Street for treatment. As of press time, the slightly injured had all been bandaged and discharged, but the lives of the seriously injured were still in danger.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Recently, I read an article in the local news section of your May 1st edition about a young man's IOU case with a dancer, involving 50,000 yuan, which does not match the facts. Zhang Xiuying was educated and has never worked as a dancer. This was stated in the first instance. At the appeal hearing the other day, when asked when they met, Zhang Xiuying replied that they met at a dance academy. Your newspaper reported that they met a dancer named Zhang Xiuying in a dance hall three years ago, which clearly does not match the facts. This is point one. At the time of the court's inquiry of the party Zhang Xiuying, my lawyer translated a mistranslation that I intended to sue Zheng criminally, but did not say that Zheng was afraid, etc. The court did not ask my lawyer about the facts. After the court inquired Zhang Xiuying herself, Zhang replied that she wanted to sue him for performing the marriage. My lawyer immediately corrected, and should be in accordance with the party's expression of intention. Your report said that the court immediately asked the lawyer representing the appellant about the facts, that Zheng Zuoxuan did not yet have financial autonomy, how could he order a huge contract of 50,000 yuan, and Zheng Zuoxuan was afraid, and Zhang Xiuying also supplied the answer, all of which did not match the language of the facts of the court hearing at the time. The matter involves discrepancies in the case and is hereby communicated, and I hope you will correct it immediately. Respectfully submitted to the Shenbao Press, Lawyer Ma Zhenzong, May 1st.</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>My son, named Fu Hai, courtesy name Hongshou, was married at Tianle Yuan the other day, and Cao Fukun, who officiated the wedding and was married by me, is my aunt's nephew. Your newspaper mistakenly regarded him as a son. It is not the truth. Please correct it immediately. To the Shenbao Press for publication, Cao Youshan respectfully presented, May 2nd.</p>

<h3>"Not Including the Far East"</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The progress of the anti-aggression organization is intermittent. It is hard to predict when we will see it take effect. It would not be surprising if the fanfare amounted to nothing. Of course, this matter is of great importance and cannot be accomplished overnight. However, it is England who is often hesitant and looking back, afraid to let go and proceed, resulting in a situation where the night is long and dreams are many. She is also to blame for this.</p>
<p>Recently, we heard news again about the anti-aggression organization conducting negotiations. England and the Soviet Union have always been willing to engage in this and are unwilling to give up easily, which is a somewhat encouraging move. However, according to the Associated Press, "Both sides have agreed that the Far East is not included;" and "This decision was made during a meeting between the Soviet ambassador and the British Foreign Secretary on Saturday, at the request of the British side." What is the reason for this? What will be the result? It is worth our attention!</p>
<p>When England and the Soviet Union initially negotiated the formation of an anti-aggression front, the Soviet Union originally advocated for including the Far East. Because the Soviet Union is not foolish, she certainly would not help the countries of Central Europe engage in anti-aggression while ignoring another aggressor in the Far East without taking precautions, allowing that aggressor to pull her leg from behind. In addition, that aggressor was originally of the same mold as Germany and Italy and is currently invading China. Considering the global situation, the deep interrelation between these facts cannot but expand the anti-aggression organization to the Far East. Since the Soviet Union put forward this opinion, we have been waiting for positive results. Now, the result has been the opposite, which is certainly regrettable for us.</p>
<p>England's reason for making this "request" is easy to understand: her policy has consistently been to guard against the Soviet Union, to protect herself, and is unwilling to truly speak up for justice or stand up. Let us not say anything about this for the moment. However, recently, she must have again held the attitude of getting by, thinking that the Far East could still be put aside. Perhaps she, England, is secretly rejoicing that the Far Eastern aggressor has not joined the German-Italian military alliance. As for whether she accepted Shigemitsu Aoi's warning (see the Tokyo Reuters report), we have no way to investigate.</p>
<p>However, our regret is not entirely for our own sake. Which of the Far Eastern aggressor's actions is not aggression? In addition to China itself, the monopolization of the Chinese market and the exclusion of the commercial interests of various countries in China are affecting every country that is subject to her aggression. If various countries do not prevent this early on, if she truly becomes the overlord of the Far East, will the world's peace be preserved? Where will the anti-aggression organization in Europe be able to achieve its full success? Our regret: first is England's short-sightedness, which will ultimately lead to future troubles; second is her inability to thoroughly assist China.</p>
<p>However, our regret is ultimately outward-looking and not inward-looking. Inwardly, for ourselves, we not only do not regret, but we have increased our courage: we must shoulder the full responsibility of anti-aggression in the Far East alone, and complete the great cause of anti-aggression in the whole world!</p>
<h3>Soviet Female Aviator (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By Paulina Osipenko, translated by He Yan from Moscow News</p>
<p>Osipenko is the most famous female aviator in the Soviet Union. She was originally the daughter of a poor peasant family. This is her autobiography. – Translator</p>
<p>When I was young, I never dreamed that I would become an aviator. My childhood was spent in the countryside of Ukraine, in a place called Novospasovka in the Dnipropetrovsk province. My father worried about our bread, and our thoughts were suppressed by heavy farming tools.</p>
<p>When I reached school age, I dropped out after studying for a short time to work and help the family. My school years passed in this way, fleetingly.</p>
<p>After graduating from the second grade, having only learned to read and write, I worked on the farm.</p>
<p>In 1924, when I was seventeen, I joined the Young Communist League.</p>
<p>In 1927, my family joined a collective farm, and I was drawn into society.</p>
<p>Although I was very young, I could distinguish between the collective farm and my father's—a poor farmer's—farm. I thought that if I had studied more, I would have understood more.</p>
<p>Soon after, our collective farm received many admission certificates from agricultural schools. I also requested to study and was sent to Kyiv to study a six-month poultry farming course.</p>
<p>But after attending the first lesson, I immediately realized that my level was far inferior to that of the other classmates. They all had seven years of education, while I only had two.</p>
<p>Should I go back to the collective farm? No, I would never do that. Even if I had to work day and night, I would stay here. I studied desperately, and my brain was filled with "effort," but I succeeded. Six months later, I graduated with the other students.</p>
<p>So, I contributed ideas to the collective farm and organized a poultry farm in the Berdyansk district. There, my fate was decided.</p>
<p>One summer, two airplanes came, and the rumbling sounds drowned out all the sounds on the farm. I stood at the door, watching, afraid to breathe.</p>
<p>The planes landed, and there was a great commotion in the village. Everyone, with gray beards and wobbling, ran to the fields to see this strange thing. Of course, I was among the first group of people.</p>
<p>The strangeness left me dumbfounded. I didn't know if what I was seeing was a plane or a person; I couldn't believe my eyes even more. Outside the fuselage, walking with the pilots, was a woman wearing a leather helmet.</p>
<p>"Oh! Can women also fly?" I asked her, my curiosity overcoming my shyness.</p>
<p>"Of course, they can," she laughed (I later learned that she was not an aviator but a nurse).</p>
<p>"Are you surprised?"</p>
<p>"Not at all."</p>
<p>"I know a female aviator in Kakov," one of the pilots said.</p>
<p>I turned around and heard that a woman can also become an aviator, or maybe I can succeed too. Why not? I want to go, I am willing to go. I firmly decided that I would be an "aviator."</p>
<p>In the meantime, I knew someone was studying at the aviation school in Sevastopol, so I wrote a letter to him without hesitation. I told him about the planes that stopped in our village, the woman in the plane, and the female aviator in Kakov; I also wrote that I wanted to be an aviator. I am twenty-three years old this year, physically healthy, and a member of the Young Communist League. Could he help me learn to fly?</p>
<p>His reply arrived saying we can determine whether to go to Sevastopol.</p>
<p>I went.</p>
<h3>Horseback Archery (Woodcut)</h3>
<h3>Mountain Flowers</h3>
<p>— Ding Ti</p>
<p>In the deep valleys, many nameless wildflowers flourish. Red, passionate colors: shining with the light of life.</p>
<p>Out of the valley, deep, lonely, desolate, rarely visited.</p>
<p>Locked in a long period of time, peaceful, disturbing. The sound of gongs at festivals, the croaking of frogs in the ponds, the evening cooking under the bean trellises, the shouts while hoeing, the cattle and sheep in the poor lanes, the sounds of flutes and drums during the New Year: such are the flowing months and years. The wildflowers in the valley watch us, silently, recording everything for us.</p>
<p>Flowers bloom and flowers fall, year after year, in the valley. The mountain flowers are delighted.</p>
<p>Breaking through the quiet atmosphere, the mountain wilderness dreams of not knowing the years. A tremendous and sudden change occurs between humans and wild beasts. To resist the encroachment of wild beasts, humans fight with them. For this battle, many warriors shed their bright red blood, damaging their limbs or contributing their entire lives. The blood of the warriors flows down, and the mountain flowers are dyed red.</p>
<p>Buried underground are white bones and cyan phosphorus, the heroic words on horseback, the wind and clouds of the desert, the ancient fortresses on the vast expanse. When the fragrant grass and thousands of weeds grow, you certainly cannot find a means to remember. But we can pick one or two bright red mountain flowers in the valley, on the battlefield, casually, making light of life and casually throwing away one's head. This allows you to clearly understand the immortality of the stars and the permanence of the sun and moon. The soul comes to the green maple forest, and the soul returns to the dark mountains and passes. The fire of life does not disappear or become blurred. Unfold the laughter of freedom, warm this ruthless valley, so that we never forget that blood has flowed on this land: passionate red, heroic red, dazzling red, giving us enthusiasm, comfort, encouragement, and impetus.</p>
<p>The valley is filled with this腥风. Life is suffocated.</p>
<p>Only the mountain flowers still stand proudly in the ugly valley, among the dense thorny bushes.</p>
<p>The wind is very腥臭, indicating the rampant nature of the wild beasts. The warriors shed their blood, cleverly using it as a kind of irrigation, cultivating free flowers, and dyeing them red.</p>
<p>In the struggle between humans and beasts, many warriors love to plant their flowers, scattering the seeds of new life. Year after year, mountain flowers bloom in clusters, not only in the valleys but also down to the lowlands and plains. The dawn and the morning breeze blow away the腥腐 of heaven and earth. Each flower unfolds the wings of freedom.</p>
<p>There is no more腥风. Revealing the freshness of the mountain flowers, the universe is filled with sunshine and auspiciousness.</p>
<p>Thousands upon thousands of years of vicissitudes have changed the spring breeze that heralds the flowers. A small building welcomes spring rain overnight, and tomorrow we will hear the sound of selling apricot flowers. Maybe when the sea has dried up and the stones have rotted, the mountain flowers will still remain: not withered, not yellowed, and not decayed.</p>
<p>Not a fortunate coincidence. You say, these mountain flowers, no, you should say the souls of the warriors, the enlighteners of freedom, are not comparable to those ordinary flowers!</p>
<p>Ending the remaining 犭羊 gives us the enjoyment of happiness. Wherever there are mountain flowers, freedom sprouts.</p>
<p>Sprouting freedom, we are indeed happy, but we must not forget the hardworking and haggard gardeners.</p>
<p>We should thank them for the cultivation of their blood!</p>
<h3>Spirit and Matter</h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>It's been this way for a long time: the West talks about matter, and China in the East talks about spirit.</p>
<p>During the Reform Movement of 1898, the Westernization Movement rose, and both the court and the public competed to talk about foreign affairs, 洋洋盈耳. Although at that time, the reformist and conservative factions each had their own reasons, abandoning spirit and taking matter was somewhat of a strange tendency.</p>
<p>History has always possessed the conditions of cause and effect. It is difficult to take one event out of context and provide a simple answer, just like trying to cut water with a knife.</p>
<p>The European and American winds and rains of the past few decades have influenced the Chinese to wear long gowns and Western trousers…</p>
<p>Never mind! Look!</p>
<p>A fascist dictator's grotesque face, a cannon, a row of machine guns, and even poison gas! Killing without batting an eye, of course. Above are airplanes and bombs, and below are armored vehicles and tanks. Matter, matter! Killing requires tightening one's belt. A piece of bread is passed by the government through an order. You can't take an extra bite. White bread休要想白白地塌. The allocation theory has been revised several times, but the result is still 覆瓿.</p>
<p>China has China's history, which sounds very good. However, the Qing Dynasty, a disaster for our nation, suppressed morale horizontally and vertically, thinking of various ways to destroy morale, making the whole country lifeless, thinking that the emperor's eternal cause had finally been properly handled. However, the 羽翎軍 were useless, and the spirit of the 神拳 was still above the Ninth Heaven, unwilling to descend for a while. So, they opened the door to welcome reform, inviting Mr. Matter to help. After Matter caused a commotion for a while, the spirit became even more distressed. Until now, the spirit is decoupled, hooking up some superficial matter. "The body of man becomes a dead thing," "Scholars lose their lives in many ways, and the great path loses its sheep on the wrong road."</p>
<p>Now, old debts are written off, and the spirit is reawakened! The 太阿 can be held upside down, giving the handle to others. The Mauser gun is also unreliable, because it can fight the enemy or protect the enemy. Therefore, when Sun Yat-sen talked about the use of weapons, it all depended on the spirit of the people. He would say: "Compared to the two, spiritual power accounts for nine parts, and material power accounts for one part." The use of matter must have "power"!</p>
<p>Facts tell us that most of the figures currently in certain positions are in their fifties and sixties. Why are there so many people in their fifties and sixties? Were they born with treacherous bones? This is the residual poison of the Qing Dynasty's suppression of morale. When they were young, they were "dead things." They had no spirit at all. Therefore, the 玄同疑古 says, "Anyone over the age of forty should be shot." There is a reason for this statement; it is not nonsense.</p>
<p>Based on this judgment, we can toast and dance, saying, "The elimination of certain figures is a matter of time. They have already declared their own death sentence in spirit and are not worth mentioning."</p>
<p>Due to the seriousness of the times, we have to send away the waste and welcome the new spirit. The so-called new spirit is the spirit that is indispensable at this time and place and required by humanity for survival. Spirit is morale, is 朝氣, is 生氣, is an invisible force. Therefore:</p>
<p>Our spirit must follow the progress of the war, making real progress. The shortcomings of the past spirit must be washed clean in the war of resistance. Those with positions should fulfill their duties; those with abilities should exert their abilities. Life should be serious and tense. The front and rear should truly unite in hatred against the enemy,休威相關, words and actions should be consistent, gathering under the goal of "the country above all, the nation above all, military affairs first, victory first," not shaking, not robbing, not deceiving, not pretending, not taking advantage of the fire to rob, closely linking general social life with the conditions of wartime.</p>
<p>If these 件件 can be done, then one portion of matter can be used as ten portions of matter. Otherwise, everything will be归于无权!</p>

<h3>If You Can't Have Children, How Can Love Be Harmonized?</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>Only with a happy family can there be a healthy society, and only with lively children can there be a happy family. In other words, a happy family has children, and a family without children has no happiness. Try to consider that after men and women get married, their first duty is to produce children to carry on the family line; therefore, only the love of children can make their parents work tirelessly and exhaust all their efforts in the hope that their children will succeed in the future. A mother's love for her son is like life, and a father's love for his son is like a treasure; therefore, only children are the crystallization of love between men and women. Those who seek a happy family, who does not think of strong children and hope to become a father early? However, there are still some people who are unrestrained and reckless in their youth, almost losing their fertility, and then realize their mistake, but it is too late to regret. I often see couples without children often blaming the woman, but in fact, half of infertility, directly or indirectly, is the fault of the man; either because of his illness or because of his congenital defects. The other half is the fault of the woman. In short, men are most fond of debauchery, so the main cause of infertility is sexual dysfunction, premature ejaculation, impotence, and early infection with gonorrhea. It is difficult to cure gonorrhea completely, but its reproductive function has been damaged and weakened. In addition, if a man has excessive sexual activity or physical exhaustion, causing the sperm produced to have no activity, it will also not be able to conceive. Therefore, men with this kind of problem must restore their health before getting married. If this is the case, many family tragedies can be avoided, and unnecessary divorces will also be reduced.</p>
<p>If the husband has such a weakness in sexual function, then there is no hope of fertility. According to my many years of experience in treating wood diseases, the male "补体康" made of genuine animal testicular essence produced in Germany does have sufficient therapeutic effect. It can cure body deficiency and neurasthenia after illness, premature ejaculation, impotence, and infertility after marriage. I have clinically experimented on 145 cases of sexual weakness and infertility, and specifically used various endocrine preparations. After three weeks, in most of the above-mentioned patients, the degree of enhancement of their reproductive function was surprisingly weak, while in the group treated with "补体康", the patients showed an average increase in sperm and blood, calculated at 2 and 4/10% per day. In other words, "补体康" has been proven to be nearly 20 times better than the blood-nourishing and sperm-producing ingredients contained in ordinary tonics, and nearly 10 times better than other similar glandular preparations. May I ask, what kind of preparations in the market that use reproductive glands as their banner can compete with it? This is truly the supreme gospel for kidney deficiency and lack of heirs. The female "补体康" has the function of regulating menstruation and planting seeds, and families lacking heirs who blame the woman can take this.</p>

<h3>Final Showdown with Gonococci</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>"The small doesn't beat the big," what exactly does this mean? Our answer is bacteria that are so small that they cannot be seen with the naked eye. Our human bodies, seven feet tall, often die from the poisonous claws of these bacteria, which are so small that they can only be seen with a microscope. Taking gonorrhea as an example, it is not known how many gonorrhea patients lose their lives to the poisonous claws of this diplococcus every year. And it is not known how many are disabled by gonorrhea every year. This kind of rampant and ferocious gonococcus. Until now, it is really unknown how many there are. Gonorrhea has existed since the beginning of mankind, and mankind has been fighting with gonococci since the beginning of time until today. The reason for this is that science has not yet reached its development, so mankind has not yet escaped its poisonous claws and hungry mouth.</p>
<p>Now the time for the final showdown with gonococci has arrived. Because now there is a medicine called "克淋侬" invented by German Dr. Peter, which is the only effective medicine for radically curing new and old gonorrhea. Because "克淋侬" has the superhuman ideal of anti-gonococcal bactericidal power. That is the basis for "克淋侬" to succeed as the most effective internal medicine for gonorrhea, occupying the top spot. Because the bactericidal power of "克淋侬" is not limited to one place, but overflows throughout the body, using it to suppress the wandering gonococci can be said to be an extremely targeted treatment. It is not the same as general chemical therapy and transmembrane bactericidal therapy, which only know about local sterilization, and sandalwood oil preparations, which only know how to forcibly astringent urethral inflammation, and have large side effects. According to Swiss Himschtrans, in all the drugs he has experienced in his life, "克淋侬" is the first choice for its powerful and thorough bactericidal power. All chemical therapies, transmembrane bactericidal therapies, etc., can be discarded. His praise for the outstanding efficacy of "克淋侬" can be seen.</p>
<h3>Lung Disease in Spring</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Lung disease is prone to excessive sexual desire in spring, so a little carelessness in health preservation can easily lead to a critical condition. Therefore, those who are resting in this season should be especially 清心寡慾. For patients with mild illness, it is okay to take a walk in the suburbs and take in more nutritious foods. According to my experience over the years, the medicine "补肺拿尔" can also be used to鎮咳化痰, kill tubercle bacilli. If you pay attention to it in many ways and treat it vigorously, no matter how stubborn the lung disease is, it will undoubtedly return to spring soon.</p>
<h3>The Most Reasonable Treatment for Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>Since the seventeenth century, science has been advocated, and the shackles on mankind's old traditions and ideas have been completely liberated, and the relationship between the sexes has become more liberated. The temptation of women has long become a habit for young people, so sexual diseases are rampant. Among them, nocturnal emission is the most serious. Due to the needs of the environment, sexual disease experts all over Europe are working hard to research and strive to invent an ideal effective medicine for sexual diseases; although they have repeatedly failed, it is inevitable that they have wasted valuable time and brainpower. However, as the ancients said, failure is the mother of success. Finally, the German master of venereology, 耐而斯传士, invented the endocrine preparation "耐而斯遗精片". After long-term experiments by national and medical private hospitals and specialists, the results proved that "耐而斯遗精片" has the effect of consolidating the essence gate and controlling nocturnal emission. According to my 30 years of experience, the number of nocturnal emission drugs newly launched in Europe and the United States every year is as many as the crucian carp crossing the river; but not many are effective. Therefore, sexual disease experts also have the suffering of not knowing what to do with the endless stream of nocturnal emission drugs. However, after the invention of "耐而斯遗精片", this kind of problem has been solved.</p>
<p>Recently, there was a patient named Chen Biannian who had the bad habit of masturbation during the development period. After marriage, sexual activity was unsuccessful, and nocturnal emission was frequent. Although he took various medicines, the effect was minimal. I ordered him to take "补体康" internally, and at the same time take "耐而斯遗精片". As a result, he recovered completely in three weeks.</p>

<h3>Aftermath of Lymphangitis—Bubo</h3>
<p>— Described by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Lymphangitis L. Ympbagitis, especially in the most acute phase of acute gonorrheal urethritis, is often accompanied by lymphangitis of the penis. This is because gonococci directly invade the tube. This symptom can be proved by the proliferation of Nobl and the secretions attached to the Lntinaenothelien endothelium.</p>
<p>Moreover, the inflammation of lymphangitis occasionally also affects the inguinal lymph nodes. This is gonorrheal bubo Tripperbebo, which has a slower course and less pain than the bubo of soft chancre. Suppuration is also rare. Those with suppuration are usually caused by mixed infection with streptococci or staphylococci. However, occasionally, gonococci are also found in the pus of pure culture-shaped bubo.</p>
<p>When gonorrheal bubo suppurates, surgical treatment is certainly necessary, but it should be quiet, and local treatment should be stopped. Moreover, the application of wet compresses of alum acetate water, warm compresses, and protein therapy can often stop its suppuration. Among the internal medicines, "克淋侬" is the most appropriate, because only by using "克淋侬" can the deeply penetrated gonococci be effectively eliminated. Otherwise, those many drug-resistant gonococci may still follow the old path. There is a possibility of mixing into other lymphatic vessels, then this symptom will inevitably fall into a more difficult situation, which must be paid attention to. In addition, in terms of electrotherapy, German static electrotherapy is also indispensable. Since I have been in clinical practice for decades, I don't know how many of these various and varied gonorrheal complications have been cured. However, the current general adherence to local therapy, chemical therapy, and transmembrane bactericidal therapy can absolutely not cure lymphangitis and its complications—gonorrheal bubo. Consultation hours are from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. From today, 20 numbers will be sent out every day, and each number will only cost 5 角.</p>

<h3>Construction of a Charitable Ferry and Purchase of a Large Bridge</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper in May of the 11th year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Council discussed the matter of the Huangpu Bridge, allocating funds to buy back the upper and lower wooden bridges and the unfinished iron bridge from the bridge owner, totaling 40,000 taels of silver, to be paid clearly within one month. Because the charitable ferry constructed by the Municipal Council has been completed. (It is found that although the charitable ferry is named "摆淸", its system is actually a pontoon bridge; because it does not use small boats to take advantage of the ride, so as to avoid the danger of congestion. The cost is 12,000 taels.) In the future, those who cross the big bridge will inevitably decrease, and the bridge owner, in view of this, sold it for 40,000 gold. It is not only inconvenient but also inappropriate to pay to cross the big bridge. This newspaper has repeatedly discussed it; from now on, one can come and go freely.</p>
<h3>Strange News of a Son Selling His Mother</h3>
<p>There is a woman in Ximen with the surname 某, who married at the age of sixteen and gave birth to a son at the age of eighteen. Her husband died the following year. The family was poor. The woman vowed not to remarry and used needlework as a means of making a living. This year, the woman is thirty-seven years old, and her son is also a young man. However, her son is addicted to gambling and has repeatedly advised her to change. This month, the son met a certain B in a opium den, who was widowed and had not remarried. The son pretended to say, "There is a young woman living with me, who has lost her husband and is poor. She has repeatedly thought about playing a different tune, but this woman does not easily see people. However, she often passes by my house. If you want to see her, please come and visit me." Certain B followed his advice and mistakenly thought that the woman described was his mother. He was very pleased. A few days later, he paid a betrothal gift of twenty yuan and went to pick her up on the appointed day. The son said to his mother, "Now there is a certain B who wants to go to another port with his son to work in his shop. The silver will be transferred by the family. Please go to certain B's house to recognize the way, so that we can interact from time to time." His mother was overjoyed and went with him. On the way, because she was walking slowly, her son falsely said that certain B could not wait any longer. Please take a sedan chair to go first. When she arrived, the house was full of guests, waiting for the bride to arrive. After questioning each other, they realized they had been deceived. Now they have sued the official.</p>

<h3>A Few Words Regarding the "Ten Nos" Movement</h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>I happened to browse a newspaper and saw the following piece of news: "The Chinese Student Service Society of this city is preparing to celebrate the May Fourth Youth Day and has decided to launch a 'Ten Nos' movement among students on that day: (1) No entering dance halls; (2) No reading harmful books; (3) No being a movie addict; (4) No wearing foreign clothes; (5) No buying foreign goods; (6) No writing love letters; (7) No jumping into the Huangpu River; (8) No loving to show off; (9) No being taken advantage of; (10) No becoming a slave to a fallen nation."</p>
<p>How grand! The "Ten Nos"! How beautiful! The "Ten Nos"!</p>
<p>The "May Fourth" is an important period in the history of our nation's revival. Since then, it has indeed nurtured some magnificent achievements concerning the nation's struggle for survival and the country's struggle for freedom. As we review the significant meaning of the May Fourth Movement, how should we encourage the future!</p>
<p>Shanghai has always been a cultural center. Even if it has become an "isolated island" due to the war, it must not fail to be an important link in the strategic movement of cultural hubs. This is something everyone understands. Therefore, we cannot but hold the youth and students of Shanghai to a higher standard.</p>
<p>The "Ten Nos" are the "Ten Nos" for the youth and students of Shanghai; the "Ten Nos" that every youth and student in Shanghai must uphold. The nation at this stage, the country at this stage, especially the youth and students of Shanghai at this stage, cannot do without this re-evaluation of their own self-examination work.</p>
<p>Dancing, obscene books, movies, foreign clothes, foreign goods, romantic relationships, chasing after pleasures, suicide, reckless showing off, and the easy access to enslavement work – which one of these is not attacking the youth and students of Shanghai day and night? If one of these takes hold, it can ruin their precious future and deplete the vitality of the nation. If we sit idly by and allow this to happen, future generations will surely criticize this time, this place, and these people. Moreover, the opportunities for urban temptation are too many, the material stimulation is doubly strong, and the spiritual dissipation is getting worse. This is why people of insight are heartbroken and seeking ways to save the situation.</p>
<p>In the autumn of national hardship, the greatest responsibility lies with the youth and students, especially in Shanghai. They should conduct a review of their daily lives and be determined to declare and implement the "Ten Nos." They should constantly add the five words "Have I done it?" to each of the "Ten Nos" and truly ask themselves with a clear conscience if there is anything to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Have I managed not to enter dance halls? Have I managed not to read harmful books? Have I managed not to be a movie addict? Have I managed not to wear foreign clothes? Have I managed not to write love letters? Have I managed not to jump into the Huangpu River? Have I managed not to love to show off? Have I managed not to be taken advantage of? Have I managed not to be a slave to a fallen nation?</p>
<h3>Letter from "An Apprentice" Hoping to Establish a Correspondence School</h3>
<p>— (Editor)</p>
<p>After this publication published an article on the 26th of last month, "The Hudong Commune Opens Four Night Schools for Apprentices," we received a letter signed "An Apprentice," stating that apprentices in semi-old-fashioned shops have no freedom at all, and therefore miss out on great opportunities to study. At the same time, they hope that those who care about apprentice education can establish free correspondence schools within the possible scope, so that they can steal some time from their busy schedules to read a little.</p>
<p>From this letter, we can see the apprentices' eagerness for knowledge. Even if they do not have the "freedom" to attend compulsory night schools, they hope to "steal some time from their busy schedules" to study on their own. I think that if institutions like the Hudong Commune in Shanghai could, they would definitely be able to accept this earnest request. However, after receiving this letter, I have some opinions I would like to share. The general old-fashioned shops really deprive the apprentices too much. In the article "The Promotion of Apprentice Education is Not Only Related to the Future of the Apprentices Themselves, but Also Can Help the Improvement of Commerce," the author once said. Even if they are a little selfish, the old bosses should not even during the two hours from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, not allow apprentices to read a little, so, I think that the issue of establishing correspondence schools is secondary, the Hudong Commune's "sending 50 investigators to various district stores to investigate the educational level of apprentices and beg managers or shop owners to allow their apprentices to study" is the urgent matter.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Bearing Sorrow and Hardship, Tears Sprinkling Around; Cherishing Thrift and Practicing Labor, Working Diligently on Ten Mu</p>
<p>Wu Jun knew that several sisters would be coming tonight, so he had notified the kitchen in advance and reserved seats. However, others also had friends and companions and had made reservations in advance. The public dining room was twice as crowded today. However, if it really couldn't fit everyone, it could be delivered to everyone's dormitory. Fortunately, they were just having a simple meal, not inviting any guests. The meal was just a few dishes more than usual. After they finished eating, they wanted to go to the school's theater to see a play, and they were all very hasty. In fact, the opening of the play was not until 9 o'clock. Why did they have to go so early? It turned out that before the opening of the play, several reels of news and short films would be shown. These news films were all the latest productions, mostly taken by the Central Film Bureau. In the past two years, China's film industry has made rapid progress. Because everyone knows that movies are not just for entertainment, but also have a greater role in publicity. They are also of great help to academic studies. Therefore, there are many new news films taken in our country. The reason is that the World's Fair will be held in New York, USA, in 1952. This World's Fair is very large in scale. Among them, there is a movie theater that can accommodate 30,000 to 40,000 viewers. The films shown include famous films from all over the world, as well as scientific news films. This movie theater is open continuously from morning to night. It is estimated that each film can only be shown once, and I am still afraid that it will not be possible to finish showing all the films by the time the Expo closes. Because in the United States recently, not only the film industry, but also the television industry, is very developed. China has recently taken a lot of news films, which are also being prepared to be sent to the New York World's Fair as soon as possible. Because the Expo is attended by people from all over the world, it can also allow people all over the world to understand the new and emerging atmosphere of China after the war. It can let people all over the world know the general situation of China. Although it has experienced such a long period of war, its recovery power is extremely strong. It is not only restoring the pre-war situation, but also surpassing everything before, and will no longer be a nobody. There is one more thing I want to report to the readers. Isn't the World Games held every four years? Next year, in 1952, is the year when the World Games will be held. And next year's World Games have been decided to be held in China. China has already designated a place not far from the capital and built it. By then, people from all over the world will come a lot, and China will also be very lively. However, the New York World's Fair in the United States opens in the spring, while our country's World Games opens in the fall. (100)</p>
<p>Life Report</p>
<h3>Waitress</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>I – a woman who dropped out of school due to family circumstances, took the waitress examination at the Shanghai Career Guidance Center and was fortunate enough to be selected from hundreds of candidates. After studying and interning for three weeks at the waitress training class run by the center, I was issued a certificate of completion and worked at Changshu Mountain View Garden. It has been more than two months now.</p>
<p>Most of us are of junior high school level. There are 30 of us in total, but after repeatedly removing those who are not qualified, there are not enough of us now. Our work is quite heavy. We are divided into early and late shifts, rotating with each other. The early shift is required to arrive at the store at 7:00 AM (8:00 AM in winter), report on the sign-in book, and start working after changing into uniforms. Two people are responsible for serving dishes and other waitress duties in three or four rooms, or working in the snack bar. We don't reach our rest time until 1:00 PM. The work is taken over by the late shift. During this time, only the tea room is open, so only four or five waitresses are responsible for the waitress work, and the early shift waitresses can rest in the rest room, or read newspapers and magazines such as Shen Bao, News Daily, and Healthy Family provided by the garden, or take a nap and recuperate. When the bell rings five times, the early and late shifts must work together until 11:00 PM, when the customers are all gone, and then we stop working and go home.</p>
<p>Although the garden does not stipulate regular holidays on weekdays, we can take one day off each month without deducting salary for rest. If we have not taken a day off in a month, we can get an additional day's salary as a reward. The garden also reserves reward money, which is distributed to diligent waitresses every year; and we have hired a public medical consultant to protect our health. The cost is shared equally by the garden and us (two yuan per person per year).</p>
<p>The Shanghai Career Guidance Center attaches great importance to the waitresses it trains, believing that this is a new profession for women. Therefore, it often sends staff to talk to us, listen to our opinions, and urge the garden to improve. Even Director Pan Yangyao often comes to guide us.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle to our work is the bad impression of "coffee girls" - servants - etc. that is deeply ingrained in people's minds. As a result, customers often treat us with a frivolous attitude. Sometimes they jokingly call us "female waiters," and sometimes they even shamelessly call us "sisters." This is really hateful and hateful. We only ignore these customers. Therefore, two slogans are now posted in each room: "The work of waitresses is noble" and "Respect your personality." However, the above-mentioned customers are of course very few. Most of them are kind and believe that earning rewards through labor is the noblest profession.</p>
<h3>The Criminal Pathology of the Japanese Economy</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Collapse is the result of disease. When the disease is in the superficial layers of the skin, it is invisible to the eyes of ordinary people. However, as the disease deepens, the pathological state gradually manifests itself. We predicted that Japan's main purpose in the war against China was to "quickly win the battle." If it lasts, there will be a disaster of economic collapse. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, it has been nearly two years. To what extent has Japan's economy reached? According to the records in Japanese newspapers, the Minister of Finance said that only 500 million of the 8.1 billion public bonds recently raised can be used to offset donations and taxes. The rest must be used to fill up the savings of the Japanese people. The savings are the people's marrow. Taking the people's marrow to turn it into medicine and ammunition is the last resort. It is not far from economic collapse.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has been a year since Japan implemented economic control regulations. Their people do not have a deep understanding, so there are more and more violations. According to a survey by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, from June of last year to February of this year, there were 13,581 people nationwide who violated the regulations. Among those prosecuted, there were 579 in Tokyo and 510 in Osaka. In addition, there were 3,150 people. Recently, recidivists have shown a gradually increasing trend. The authorities of the Ministry of Justice believe that this is a mistake due to the lenient attitude of the past. They should change their methods and adopt a strict punishment policy for violators. A few days ago, Matsumoto, the director of the Criminal Affairs Bureau, issued instructions to all prosecutor's offices across the country, saying that in the future, when dealing with such cases, they should consider the circumstances of the case and impose physical punishment and fines, but fines should be the main punishment. Any law that is violated by too many people will have an effect equal to zero. When will Japan's economy collapse? Judging from the above situation, I am afraid it is not very far away?</p>
<p>Moreover, there are indeed many Japanese people in China who take advantage of their power to make money from the national crisis. Some use military passports to transport goods, or collude with unscrupulous merchants to engage in unclear business operations. This kind of degenerate phenomenon was not seen or heard in Japan in the past. Now, this kind of fact is not only heard, but also seen. The decline of the Japanese national character and the collapse of the national, social, and public economy can be seen from this pathological state of the national character.</p>

<h3>Famous Director William Keighley and Wife Spend Twenty Hours in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>The news that Hollywood famous director William Keighley and his wife, Genieve Topping, were on their honeymoon passing through Shanghai has been reported in this publication on April 22. Sure enough, the two artists arrived in Hong Kong at 11:00 AM yesterday. The reporter met them with Mr. Shi Hengyuan in the evening and wrote a short article after coming back to share with the readers.</p>
<p>Coming and Going in a Hurry</p>
<p>Keighley and his wife are definitely on their honeymoon trip, but they have been married for nearly a year. Leaving from Hollywood, the first country they passed through was Japan. After arriving in Yokohama, they went to Tokyo. However, they stayed for only two full days before coming to Shanghai by the original ship. After landing yesterday afternoon, they stayed at room 401 of the International Hotel. Representatives from Warner Bros. Pictures in Shanghai warmly received them. Around 1:00 PM, they went with a Chinese gentleman to pay their respects at the war sites in Zhabei. Around 4:00 PM, they returned to Nanjing Road to buy some Chinese goods. They didn't return to their residence until 5:30 PM. At that time, more than 20 Chinese and foreign reporters who had made an appointment to talk at 5:00 PM had been waiting for a long time. At 7:00 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by Warner Bros. At 8:00 PM, they went to the backstage of the Golden Theater to see Zhang Eyun put on makeup, and then listened to the play on the front stage - Yanmenguan; at 11:00 PM, they visited the Paramount, Metropolitan, and Lido dance halls, and their Hollywood tour ended; after 12:00 AM, they rested. At 6:00 AM this morning, they took a US Navy patrol boat to catch the Empress of Japan to Hong Kong; they changed to a plane to tour the mainland. He did not disclose the destination. Was it Yunnan and Sichuan? At most, they will stay for a week, then go to Saigon and Singapore, and then go to various European countries, and return to New York in early July. This is his itinerary. He only stayed in Shanghai for 20 hours, it was really coming and going in a hurry.</p>
<p>Impressions of Japan</p>
<p>Keighley and his wife were surrounded by reporters! It was not easy to say a few words to him. We asked him about his general impressions of Japan, but he was very cautious in his words, always avoiding the important and taking the light. He looked carefully at our faces and said, "Are there any Japanese reporters here?" We answered "No!" Only then did he feel relieved and said, "When we arrived in Tokyo, we first met with the Japanese press. The first sentence they asked me was, 'Is it true that Hollywood stars refuse to wear Japanese silk stockings?' I could only say that I was not very clear about this... I visited various film companies and felt that the equipment was very good, and the costumes for period dramas were very beautiful, but the fashion dramas were too bad. I don't agree with them." He didn't want to say anything else.</p>
<p>Paying Respects to the War Sites</p>
<p>Keighley decided early on to pay his respects to the war sites in Shanghai, which shows that he is very concerned about the Sino-Japanese war. Yesterday, he spent three hours looking at the scorched earth of the anti-Japanese war ruins in the central area of Zhabei Jiangwan. He did not express any feelings, but his tone was very sad and sympathetic; especially when passing through a certain place and seeing the hideous faces of countless civilians being searched by the invaders, he felt very sad and wanted to capture it with his camera, but he was strictly forbidden and deeply regretted it!</p>
<p>Love of National Drama</p>
<p>Because his time was very valuable, we were not convenient to say much. We just casually asked three questions: (1) Which of the films directed by the gentleman in the past is the most satisfactory? (2) What new films will be made after returning to the United States this time? (3) What are your views on Chinese films and dramas? ... His answers were quite simple: (1) It doesn't matter what the nature of the film is, but it depends on the quality of the script. I am more satisfied with "Beggar Emperor" because the protagonists are very good. (2) I can't say for sure what films I will direct after returning to the United States. (3) I am very interested in Mei Lanfang's drama. I remember seeing his play in the United States. I felt that the music, costumes, and expressions were all good, but unfortunately I didn't understand it very well. I regret that I was not able to visit China's photography studio on this trip! He also said that he used to know more than 40 Chinese characters, but now he only remembers the characters "ren" (人) and "tian" (田). We laughed together. At this point, everyone shook hands and said goodbye. The left picture shows his couple and their autographs.</p>
<h3>Soviet Color Revolutionary Film "The Woman Soldier" Premieres</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union's first sound film, "Road to Life," is not well known in China, but everyone who has seen Soviet films knows its greatness. But regrettably, after watching "Road to Life," we have not seen other works by the original director, Aik, for many years. It turns out that Aik was carrying out a very serious task in the Soviet film industry: he completed the Soviet Union's first sound film "Road to Life" - laying the technical foundation for sound in the Soviet film industry, and then he shouldered another important task - making color films, laying the technical foundation for color films in the Soviet film industry. This first color film is "The Woman Soldier," which will soon premiere at the "Huguang" Theater.</p>
<p>We only know that Aik is a good director, but from this arduous task, we can also know that he is a brilliant technical expert. But from "The Woman Soldier," we also know that Aik is also a screenwriter and an actor (he plays a role in the film).</p>
<p>"The Woman Soldier" is a pioneering color film, but technically, it is not inferior to American films. "The Woman Soldier" uses "Nightingale Song" to run through the entire film, depicting the touching and tragic revolutionary struggle of female workers on the eve of the Russian Revolution.</p>

<h3>The Four Great Dan Actors and Wine</h3>
<p>— Hai Ce</p>
<p>Songfeng, the host, hosted a banquet for his adopted daughter Tu Meisheng and purchased Tai Diao wine from a certain wine shop. The host asked me: Is the brewed wine good? I drank it and found it sweet, and said: Wonderful! As mellow as Mei Lanfang's singing. Therefore, I used wine to describe the four great Dan actors. I once used sweet (Mei), sour (Xun), bitter (Cheng), and spicy (Shang) to describe the four Dan actors. Now I have a new metaphor. Record it for drama fans and wine lovers to discuss.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang is like Tai Hao Hua Diao (thick in flavor and strong in alcohol).</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu is like Zhuye Qing (clear in flavor and the alcohol strength is similar to Tai Diao).</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng is like Kuli Sha (Western wine that is sweet and suitable for women).</p>
<p>Shang Xiaoyun is like Gaoliang (strong in flavor and has little aftertaste, but it can also make wine friends addicted).</p>

<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Reason for the Increased Value of Actors After the Republic of China</p>
<p>At the end of the Qing Dynasty, although it can be said that drama was at its peak, the psychology of discrimination against actors in society was very common. For example, children of actors were not allowed to take exams, outsiders were ashamed to discuss marriage with children of actors, and even there were popular sayings such as "prostitutes, handsome men, servants, and soldiers" being mentioned in the same breath. At the same time, there was a bad habit in the acting world of setting up private workshops, establishing hall names, and teaching children to drink with wine, and this fashion was not limited to the female roles, even the famous Tan Xinpei had the creation of Yingxiutang, so Sun Juxian often liked to grasp this handle and said to outsiders; "Xinpei's reputation is great, but unfortunately, he always has the habits of a private workshop." Tan Zixiaopei also said to me one year: "Now many reporters like to use the three characters Tan Yingxiu to represent his name whenever they mention our old man. In fact, that is simply the same as scolding us. Because the two characters "Yingxiu" are the names of the hall numbers established when private workshops were popular at the time. Unexpectedly, some people who do not understand the truth actually use it as our old man's nickname, which is ridiculous." Furthermore, like seeing people, they must first ask for peace and order to sit before daring to take a seat. Therefore, there are some unequal habits invisibly. Therefore, the value of actors in the Qing Dynasty was always very low. Later, fortunately, Tian Jiyun and Sun Juxian repeatedly opposed the private workshop system and vigorously advocated its abolition, in order to fight for the personality of the drama world. Therefore, the bad habit of actors drinking with wine gradually disappeared invisibly. The above is a description of the situation in which the actors themselves first realized this and the advanced actors such as Tian Sun automatically rectified its internal affairs. After the Republic of China, the warlords, politicians, and members of the Senate and House of Representatives organized groups to support the actors, and often interacted with famous actors. Not only did the rewards obtained by singing increase sharply compared to before, but also their status in society increased day by day. The following are just a few of the more prominent facts to prove the intense support of actors by warlords and politicians before the Northern Expedition.</p>
<p>(1) Anhui Governor Ni Sichong invited all the famous actors to Bengbu on a special train to celebrate his mother's birthday. In the early years of the Republic of China, Ni Sichong moved to Bengbu, a key point of the Jinpu Railway, in the position of Anhui Governor. At that time, Ni sent a special person and prepared a special train to go north to the old capital to invite all the famous actors to go south for his mother's birthday. The male roles included Sun Juxian, the founder of the Sun school, Liu Hongsheng, the founder of the Liu school, Wang Fengqing, the successor of the Wang school, Yu Shuyan, the successor of the Tan school, Yang Xiaolou, the master of martial arts, the female roles were Chen Delin, the master of Qingyi, and famous actors Wang Yaoqing, Mei Lanfang, and Shang Xiaoyun, Gong Yunfu, the master of Lao Dan; the Jing roles were Qian Jinfu, the first martial arts Jing, Qiu Guixian, the first bronze hammer, etc., the clown roles were Wang Changlin, the first of all clowns; Yu Ruzhu Suyun and Jiuzhenfeng were also first-class famous actors in Xiaosheng and Wudan. When the special train arrived in Bengbu, Ni also sent the governor's military band to the station to welcome them. In the Qing Dynasty, there was no precedent for senior governors and governors to have such a grand performance. It was a rare event for Ni to make such a groundbreaking move and treat the actors so well. However, the increase in the value of actors was also the first time. (1)</p>

<p>Opening Methods, Game 33</p>
<p>Black Moves First</p>
<p>Reverse Screen Horse Against Central Cannon</p>
<p>Move Sequence Continues from the Previous Game</p>
<p>Rook 9 Advances 1, Cannon 8 Moves to 7, Rook 1 Moves to 6, Rook 8 Advances 4, Pawn 5 Advances 1, Pawn 5 Advances 1, Rook 6 Advances 8, Advisor 5 Retreats 4, Rook 9 Moves to 6, Advisor 4 Advances 5, Rook 6 Advances 1, Explanation</p>
<p>Red plays Horse 8 Advances 9, a flank horse setup, with Rook 1 Advances 1, a horizontal rook. Originally, the direct rook and horizontal rook were to be played together against the central cannon. Now, seeing the opponent respond with a flank horse setup, there is an opportunity to exploit. Therefore, Red quickly advances the horizontal rook to attack the center using the coiled horse cannon method. Rook 9 Moves to 8 followed by Horse 7 Advances 5 are both offensive and defensive moves. Rook 1 Moves to 4, deploying the rook to block the opponent's horizontal rook path, seemingly stabilizing the situation.</p>
<p>Rook 9 Advances 1, forming a double horizontal rook formation with the intention of targeting the opponent's rook. Cannon 8 Moves to 7, opening the rook's path, then advances Rook 6 Advances 8 to remove the rook. Advisor 5 Retreats 4, followed by Rook 6 Advances 5, a forced move. At this point, the black pieces press forward on the upper two ranks, creating a powerful momentum. In the previous game, Rook 1 Moves to 4 seemed like a preemptive rook deployment that would not lead to a disadvantage. Little did Red know that the black forces, through coordinated attacks, could force Red's rook on the fourth file into insignificance, while the rook on the eighth file is unable to be deployed effectively. In short, the flank horse setup is not suitable against the central cannon.</p>
