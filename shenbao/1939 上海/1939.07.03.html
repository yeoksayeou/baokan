<h3>但澤市緊張與大局</h3>
<p>德國謀攫但澤自由市，在政治上之安排，則德國負責官員與但澤市當局旣昌言不諱於勾結之成熟：在軍事上之運籌，則德國戰鬥人員與重輕武器之大量輸入但澤，絡繹不絕，跡近公開；蓋綜觀近日發展實况，確乎已到圖窮七見之階段。於是關懷世變者，僉以前途戰不戰為問。</p>
<p>不戰則苟安。戰則空間影響殆及全人類，時間影響且垂今後牛世紀，非細事也。事在今茲，誠有若干理由，謂不至於戰，然橫梗目前，懸而不決之問題正多，相激相盪，固不容久懸；且緣是競張軍備，不知所底，不戰亦復不了。若謂必戰，則希特勒滿望水到渠成，不戰而定；張伯倫但願以應戰之決心，制止戰禍之爆發；是雙方未欲戰也。故居今日而問戰或不戰，固莫能置答者也。</p>
<p>抑問題之本質，還不在所謂戰不戰。要在各國如何各自修正其態皮，抑制其願望，以求解決糾紛；更以奠定長治久安為標準，而不恤若干合理之犧牲；例如法蘭西與土耳其最近成立協定，使澄淸之束地中海局勢，更見溫和而穩定，是實可稱為現代人類文明之代表作。是以當前癥結，乃為和平之途徑安在。若不此之圖，或則不顧他國之獨立自由，務以予求予取為快意；或以過皮之自尊而憧憬於無量前途，或以歷史片段之陳蹟為準，爭覇稱雄，務求虛榮實利之至尊無對而無所止境；或以機會所在，有隙可乘而求多爭得一分，或以一時環境有利於己而求多守得一分，自力所及，乃至他力所得假借，計較錙銖而無所不用其極；凡此者，其意識上根本不尙和平，如此相摩擦而竟不至於戰者，初非有不戰之道，亦非有戰不戰之歧途之存在，僅乃僥倖未戰耳。溯自西班牙內戰之國際糾紛起，經慕尼黑協定；其間復如捷克，奧地利，米美爾，阿爾巴尼亞諸變故；無事不可戰，亦每次皆有開戰之理由；雖迄今未肇戰禍，顧乃劍拔弩張之益甚，歐洲之主要問題依然絕未解決。和平之途徑茫然緲然，則問題豈在戰不戰，僅在何時戰而已。但澤倘若竟為德國所攫，在德為慣技；因此竟為大戰導火綫，在事理為不足異也。</p>
<p>於是言之，鑒於但澤問題之演進而使歐局緊張，遂注意於但澤問題在今後數星期內之發展，以及英法德義諸國之舉措，則事實上所存之疑問，乃為苟安之局尙能維持幾時？蓋希特勒之野心便是戰爭動力，而其不戰而定之私願則不足為茍安作保障；張伯倫之決心應戰足以展緩戰禍，而其一念及於戰禍猶望避免則將誘致冒險者之猛進。雖冒險者猛進之結果，或以但澤自由市之國聯委員非但無所作為抑且表示放任，或以波蘭及時委棄但澤而不抗戰，或以英法因任何理論之根據與事實之杆格而不踐行其約束，是仍有萬一不戰之望；然在希特勒領導下之德國旣國勢日張，願望無饜，則但澤即使不戰而定，而歐局之不戰猶僅為時間問題。况默察國際，惟恐天下不亂，但願置身事外，坐收漁利，陽事委蛇，陰相鼓煽者，非必無其人焉。要之，國際一切糾紛有待整理，和平基礎有待確立，此非最積極之行動無以致之。不能整理糾紛，不能確立和平基礎，則不能消弭戰禍，戰禍之爆發祇時間問題，而戰事之形態將為不分皂白之混戰。所謂積極行動，非媚强抑弱之綏靖，非被動之互助應戰，乃為一手正義，一手寳劍，使侵略者就範！</p>
<h3>財部公佈非常時期　禁止進口物品辦法　財部發言人之談話</h3>
<p>（重慶）財部公布非常時期禁止進口物品辦法如次、（一）依照附表所載海關進口物品十八組、二百三十四稅則號列、由財政部令飭總稅務司、轉飭各關、一體禁止進口、（二）上列禁止進口物品禁令頒布後、同時不許報運轉口、（三）禁止進口物品如因調劑後方市價、供給特種用途、或有其他正當原因、經政府機關核請者、得由財政部査酌實際需要、核發購運特許證、其給證辦法另訂之、（四）禁止進口物品、凡用郵包由外洋寄遞進口、或由本國口岸寄遞轉口、亦適用本辦法之規定、（二日電）</p>

<p>「維持國際收支平衡、為任何國家經濟政策中之要義、而在作戰期間、貿易易趨逆勢、尤應山政府採用種種方法、維持平衡、俾不致影響國民經濟、妨礙戰事進行、我國入超素鉅、而戰時所需國防用品、及工業交通器材等品、仍多仰賴輸入，設不挽回國際收支之逆勢、必不免</p>
<p>影響外匯</p>
<p>市塲、妨礙經濟、本部有鑒於此、前於二十六年九月、擬定促進生產調整貿易辦法大綱、設立農產工鑛貿易三調整委員會、並另撥資余開辦兵險、實為戰時經濟要策、同時並擬具禁止限額特許之管理進口方案、呈請核定、以種原因管理進口方案、未能核准實施、嗣於上年三月斤實行管理外滙時、復經提出管理進口方案、擇定若干種類奢侈品、及牛奢侈品、擬予分別</p>
<p>禁限入口</p>
<p>其為抗戰建設、及日用切需之品、則准山政府銀行照法價售給外匯、復因外界橫生疑沮、未能付諸實行、此年餘以來、敵僞利用我之稅款、及掠奪我之物資、所得之鉅額法幣、大量套換外匯、致引起外匯市塲上數年來未有之激變、自平衡基金成立、英方銀行加入平衡工作、原為英方援助之盛意、亦屬便利國際貿易之道、乃平衡工作受意外之威　、</p>
<p>旣感困難</p>
<p>而在抗戰期間、國民既應屬行節約、减少不必要之消費、並應增强購買必需品之力量、以符軍事第一、勝利第一之旨、經縝密商討、僉以禁止一部份物品進口、為戰時必要之措施、亦必為中外人士所共諒、即凡非抗戰建國及人生日用所切需、或有部份需要、而可覔本國產品代用、或多由敵國產製輸入時、容易冒牌侵銷、一切物品均應禁止輸入、特即依照上列標準、選定</p>
<p>禁運物品</p>
<p>擬定禁運辦法、舉如洋酒·洋菸·海產·絲貨·化妝品·裝飾品·玩具•樂器、一部份糖品·輩食·罐頭菓實·蔬菜、以及帶有奢侈性之毛貨·棉貨在木材·紙張·竹木藤器·土石製品、以及可覔代用品之液體燃料等類、都凡二百三十四稅則號列、均在應禁之列、業經本部電令總稅務司、分電各關、自令到日起、一律禁止進口、綜計上項物品、禁止進口以後、照二十七年進口額推算、約可省出二萬三千餘萬元、約合美金六千八百萬元、英金一千三百萬鎊、此項</p>
<p>鉅額外匯</p>
<p>支出、即可移用於購貿抗戰建國必需之物料、是在我國不過變更外匯用途、在各國不過轉換其輸入物品、實質上其對華貿易之統計、仍不至大減、當可獲得各友邦之充分諒解、茲照錄非常時期禁止進口物呂辦法如下、</p>
<p>（一）依照附表所載海關進口物品十八組、二百三十四稅由號列、各關一體禁止進口、</p>
<p>（二）上列禁止進口物品、於禁令頒布後、同時不許報運轉口、</p>
<p>（三）禁止進口物品如因調劑後方市價供給特種用途、或有其他正當原因、經政府機關核請者、得由財政部查酌實際需要、核發購運特許證、共給證辦法另</p>
<p>（四）禁止進口物品、凡用郵包由外洋寄遞進口、或由本國口岸寄遞轉口、亦適用本辦法之規定、至禁止進口物品之名稱及號列詳表、另於報端公布、（二日電）</p>
<h3>出口貨物結匯　領取滙價差額辦法</h3>
<p>（重慶）財政部發言人、頃對公布「出口貨物結匯領取匯價差額辦法」之意義、發表談話於下、關於禁止非必需進口物品意義及辦法、旣已另行發表聲明、同時促進出口貿易間題、本部向極認為重要、自抗戰開始、即擬定促進生產調整貿易辦法大綱、組織調整貿易機構、頒布各項調整辦法、上年六月、復頒行</p>
<p>維護生產</p>
<p>促進外銷辦法、除用豁免捐稅、代保兵險、便利運輸、融通資金等方法協助商人經營出口貿易外、復由政府貿易機關、盡量收購、以期增進輸出、振發生產、惟近來因交通困難、國產輸出無由增多、出口數量因而减少、商民在此種情形之下、成本加重、資力不充、對於經營外輸、不免動懐疑畏、而向在國內經營出口之</p>
<p>外國商行</p>
<p>又以非通常貿易阻礙輸出、非本部維護國民經濟之本旨、兼以最近外匯市塲變動、為援助平衡H作、以减輕其困難起見、為由本部擬定「出口貨物結匯領取匯價差額辦法」、除與易貨償債儲料有關之桐油·茶葉·猪鬃·礦產·四類外、其餘出口貨物、所得之外匯、應按照法價得結外匯、售予國家銀行同時由中央銀行給予相常於法價及銀行掛牌價格之差額、如此辦理、大多數出口貨物均可</p>
<p>自由運銷</p>
<p>所得鉅額匯價、除支付繳費外、尙可獲得其餘、是商民所有困難、政府悉為解除、政府所需外匯、仍得大量集中於維持法幣、安定金融之中、復能促進外銷、增加生產、對於國計民生、洵屬兼籌並顧」、茲將出口貨物結匯領取匯價差額辦法，照錄於後、</p>
<p>（一）所有出口貨物應結外匯、除桐油·茶葉·豬鬃·礦產·四類、因與易貨償債及儲料有關、應由政府貿易機關體察產銷情形、及國際市價、隨時以優惠價格、統籌收購運銷外其餘貨物、無論山政府貿易機關巡銷、或由商號自行貿易、概須依照法價、將所得外匯、售予中國·或交通銀行、其售價應得之法幣、由中國或交通銀行取得結匯人同意、於指定之內地地點、以法幣支付之、</p>
<p>（二）前項依照法價結匯之出口貨物、於實際結淸匯額後、得憑結算證件、向結匯銀行領取法價、與該行掛牌價格之差額結匯、銀行得向結匯人收取銀行向例應得之手續費、但不得超過百分之三、</p>
<p>（三）前項差額山原結匯銀行取得結匯人之同意、於指定之內地地點、以法幣支付之、（二日電）</p>

<h3>美衆院通過新中立法　赫爾認為不滿意　禁運軍火條款務當取消此與防止戰爭大有關係</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）赫爾國務卿頃向各報記者發表談話、略謂政府所贊助之中立法案、竟遭失敗、殊可惋惜、茲當賡續努力、務使軍火禁止出口條欵、不致刋入新中立法之內、「余前於本年五月二十九日分函參衆兩議院外交委員會主席、為和平與中立計劃列舉六點、深信足為吾國維持和平、勿令牽入戰爭漩渦、以視載有軍火禁止出口條欵、或共他類似條欵之中立法、更為有效、余於提出此項計劃之前、先與參衆兩院外交委員會各委員曁各黨議員屢相談話、然後函達南院外交委員會審査、初意國際時局如斯、縱使此項計畫、未能盡如人意、但當能為國會大多數議員所接受、不料卒以數票之差、而遭失敗、是為維持和平利益計、及為吾國國際關係、最可寳貴之利益計、均可惋惜、誠以余之計盡、匪特在戰事發生後、為吾國保持和平之最佳方法、而最着重之點、乃在有裨於戰爭之防北、遠較現行中立法或共他類似的法律為勝、至共與舉世公認之國際法完全相符、猶為餘事、因此種種、余自當賡續努力、務令所提建議、能為國會所採納」云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於美國衆議院前日通過之不准以軍火供給交戰國一項決議案、法國人士之驚訝情緒、可於今晨各報覘之、失望與憂盧、溢於言表、各報咸謂、倘戰事一旦爆發、羅斯福總統除以食糧與原料供給英法兩國外、對於接濟軍火一事、恐將無能為力矣、（二日海通電）</p>
<h3>美國本年度　決算槪數</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）一九三八—三九年財政年度決算槪數、頃巳發表、計支出項下、九、二六七、八七八、〇二九美尤、而收人項下僅有五、六六七、八二三、六二五美元、出入相抵、不敷之數為三、六〇〇、〇五四、四〇四美元、叉支出項下以國防費用一、〇七四、六〇一、六四〇美元為數最大、又一九三八—三九財政年度與一九三七—三八年度相較、收入雖因經濟蕭條而减少、而支出仍大為增加、此外國債總額、亦自三七、一六四、七四〇、三一五美元、增至四〇、四三九、五三二、四一一美元、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美總統金融權力雖滿期　美元依然穩定　三國貨幣協定運用如常</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統在幣制金融上所享有之權力延長時效案、因參議院反對派議員用延宕手段之故、未能成立、頃據財政部中人談稱、政府今後雖不能運用匯兌平衡基金二十萬萬美元、但一俟各銀行於本月三B休假期滿復業之後、財政部可於必要時、按照適當價格、購進黃金、聯邦準備銀行、亦可買賣外匯、以維持美元之穩定、因此總統在金融上權力、雖已滿期、而致引起種種困難、但因財政部與聯邦準備銀行合作之故、英法美三國貨幣協定、仍可運用如常、（一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統羅斯福企圖獲得幣制權力之鬥爭、本星期末已暫吿平靜、此次政府與反對派（包括共和黨與守舊民主黨）幣制鬥爭之結果、現在猶難逆料、卽星期三之投票、亦恐未能決定、美總統昨晚返海德公園私宅、正計劇攻擊彼之「幣制敵人」、美財長麼根鞱昨亦返私宅休息、該處距總統私宅不遠、故衆料渠將與總統商討應付敵人辦法、據總統友人云、總統對於本星期在國會兩次之失敗極為不滿、星期五晚直至深夜仍繼續研究應付辦法、衆院昨晚接受建議、恢復總統之貶値銀元權力、而將國內銀價制定為每盎斯七一·一分云、（二日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>德對但澤　內外佈置並進　舊船載運大砲軍火東普魯士大修橋路</h3>
<p>但澤　德元首希特勒將於七月杪來游但澤、親自接受但澤市於其生辰所贈予之但澤榮譽公民資格、此說雖未證實、然一切準備現在進行中、國社黨機關但澤郵報批評但澤局勢中英法關係、謂但澤必須交還德國、何時實現、將由希特勒決定之云、目前種種佈置、似已使波蘭遇有先發制人、抑靜待國社黨佈置完畢而後始動之難題、國社黨方面雖否認探行軍事計畫、然與此相反之消息、時常洩漏於外、國社黨船廠已封閉兩夜、雖値夜更夫亦不許入內、聞戰具卽在此登陸、而由卡車運去、常有德國軍人駕駛卡車公然過市、鐵路總站對面之某旅館、已被收用為軍人宿舍、上週初曾徵用馬匹、今復調査各種汽車、各車主頃已接到準備立時徵用之通吿、東普魯士愛爾平路在戰略上極關重要、現已禁止私人往來、從事修理、聞造橋材料業已備齊、以便於一小時內在羅資布德地方造成浮橋、渡過維斯吐拉河、貨幣貶價之說、雖未證實、但亦未見否認、致事業界愈形不安、惟波蘭人與國社黨現皆審慎避免公然挑釁事件、國社黨尙未準備作斷然行動、而波蘭目前亦束手不動、昨日英人報紙悉被沒收、蓋欲使人民不知外事之眞相也、惟各界人士現皆知德國在但澤之軍事動作、勢必引起英法方面之直接行動（二日路透電）</p>
<p>華沙　此問各報頃賡續登載消息、謂有舊輪船數艘、滿裝大砲軍火、自德國東普魯士省秘密運至但澤港起卸、此項舊船佯為開往但澤港修理、藉以避免波蘭國關吏之注意云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙　此間每日畫報頃載稱、但澤自由市內、除成立「義勇團」而外、並編有邊境特別保衛隊、此外、義勇團所用軍氈三千一百件、均係波蘭國上西萊集省某廠所製、此事亟應澈究云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德巡洋艦　將訪但澤　日期在八月秒</h3>
<p>華沙　此間負責方面頃證實、德國政府業已通吿波蘭政府、謂該國巡洋艦「柯尼斯堡」號將於八月杪駛抵但澤港、俾為歐戰時在該港海面沉沒之德國巡洋艦「瑪特堡」號、舉行追悼儀式云、據聞波蘭政府對於此事、並未提出異議云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙　關於德國巡洋艦「柯尼斯堡」號定於八月杪駛往但澤港事、此間一般人士認為並無重大意義、在近數年間、德國軍艦駛往但澤港已非一次、一九三六年間德國巡洋艦「萊浦齊」號曾駛抵但澤港、當時該艦艦長僅拜訪自由市當局、而於國聯駐但澤自由市高級委員處、則未往投刺、因此發生爭議、迨至一九三七年間、又有德國水雷敷設艦六艘、駛抵但澤港、各該艦長除拜訪市參議會主席曁波蘭高級委員而外、並曾訪問國聯會高級委員、此次「柯尼斯堡」號、自有先例可援、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德國凖備　建造新艦　供應艦及修理艦</h3>
<p>（倫敦）星期日泰晤士報海軍訪員聲稱、觀於德海軍最近之發展情形、可確知德國現正計劃準備若干行駛海上之供應艦及修理艦、以彌補其對於海外海軍根據地之缺點、此項軍艦、可用作在北海外作戰各潛艇及小型艦之活動根據地、並可使彼等離主耍根據地後、仍得作長時期之活動、更可儘量利用同盟國家之海港、該訪員又稱、德海軍對於此項供應艦之準備、尙係最近開始、德海軍當局因各船廠擔任此項工作後、對於其他軍艦之建造、勢必延緩、故雖訂造數艘、而另一方面則將若干商輪改裝、以資應用、按德國現共有潛艇供應艦八艘、及摩托魚雷艇供應艦二艘、而任務遍世界之英國海軍、則僅有此項供應艦八艘可行駛海上、兩相比較、殊堪注意、（二日路透社電）</p>

<p>（羅馬）義國政洽雜誌「國際關係」今日載有不署名之論文、謂英法維護但澤現狀之希圖、勢必釀成歐洲大戰、軸心國將自動的用其軍力、以阻止民治國干涉但澤問題、義國亦將乘此機會、以饜滿其對於法國領土之要求云、此文顯係官塲授意而作、藉以警吿英法、並警吿土國、勿與聞巴爾幹事（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）英法兩國對於現行國際局勢所採取之態度、頃山此閒各報加以評論、均謂各該國現行政策、目的僅在恫嚇德國、惟但澤自由市之歸併德國、事在必行，此種恫嚇之舉、實無何項價値、此外、各報所用標題、均猛烈攻擊英法兩民主國、或謂反和平運動疋在發展中」、或謂「英法兩國企圖阻止不可避免之事件、徒見其心勞R細」云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）關於英法蘇聯三國締結互助協定事、本日此間外交界人士頗表樂觀、均謂英法兩國新建議業已致送蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫、協定可望迅速成立、建議內容未經發表、據接近政府人士所知、歐洲各國凡其領土完整與主權獨立之維持、對於英法蘇聯三國之一具有生存攸關之重要性者、雖未列舉其名、但建議性質頗為廣泛、足以應付一切情形、至本日午刻、英法兩國代表與蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫談話經過情形、此間官方嚴守秘密、但觀於法國駐英代辦曾於午刻與傍晚時、與外務部專司東歐事務之官員兩度接洽、可見莫洛托夫對於英法新建議或仍提出若干種意見、好在歐洲局勢近又緊張、尤以但澤問題為然、英法蘇三國談判受其影響、尙可加緊進行、早底於成云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日方對鎖影響　外國貿易</h3>
<p>（重慶）中國軍事發言人今日批評日方之封鎖中國東南部海岸、尤其為近在浙閩粤之作戰云、此等戰事旣不致影響軍器與軍火之輸入中國、亦不致影響出口之行動、因自軍與以還、中國卽已停用東南部海岸、借此等用途也、就他方面言、日方之封鎖將影響在華之外國貿易云、（二日路透社電）</p>

<h3>西報紀載　華北日軍反英運動　北平民衆被逼參加示威游行完全失敗</h3>
<p>字林報六月廿八日北平通訊云、日方除封鎖天津英租界、侮辱該地英人外、現藉其嚴格統制之華字報紙、藉招貼·游行·大會·以及其他一切舊法、在華北遍境忙於激起反英情緒、日方在此方面之努力、迄今不能謂為特殊成功、吾人猶憶一九二五年與一九二七年共產黨與國民黨激動猛烈而廣泛之反英示威游行、目前中國民衆對此運動、</p>
<p>態度全非</p>
<p>顯與往昔相反、北平人民易被激動而作任何反外示威游行、但於目前之例證中、彼等簡直表示絕無興趣、英人不必以為普通華人不參與目前之示威游行、乃因彼等愛英人之故、而自鳴得意、事實在於北平人民不喜日人、較不喜其他任何外人為尤甚、此日人或將驚詫者也、華人受日人統治兩載、所遭經歷、絕不能引起彼等愛護日方之心、因日方於貨幣行施詐術、致生活程度劇增、日憲兵與日方統治之華警施用高壓手段、甚下等之日人、源源而入北平、驕橫兇暴、以及日人動輙以征服者態度自居、凡此種種、遂使日人絕不能得華北人之半點好感、結果、華人今對日人發起之事、均抱疑懼與不信任、再者、已往兩年中、日方已從事所謂自動的示威游行、雖迭出不窮、而</p>
<p>均吿失敗</p>
<p>華人遂厭於參加，以免繼續出乖露醜、盡力宣傳「全中國反英協會」大會、六月廿三日在禁城舉行者、卽其明證、該大會完全失敗、而成笑柄、是會自始卽不能稱之為「自動的」、因僅備大紅色特章之華人、始准與會、外人則須經介紹、詳細査閱名刺後、始得人內、當記者往觀時、見有已成慣例每會必到之小學校男女學童與代表一羣、塲外有執旗者約百人、其餘聽衆不出五百人、出入會塲者、隨時不絕、似無人對演說稍予注意者、演說者高立平壇上擴音機後、</p>
<p>語不成腔</p>
<p>其地遠非炸彈所能投及、大多數聽衆在廣塲中躑躅不息、學童則出沒人羣、互相捕捉、以為嬉戲、演說者冷淡之聲調、當然甚顯明的與一九二五年及二七年反英大會中演說者口若懸河之激烈演說、逈不相同、大會完畢後、卽有卡車一列、載正式參加者駛過平市各要道、手揮旗幟、且喊口號、並發傳單、若輩均露可笑的羞怯之容、他人對此筆底描述稱為若是盛大之示威游行所得整個印象、僅為參加者意態冷淡、</p>
<p>非出所願</p>
<p>而已、「主持」此反英運動之華人、為商會·北平市府•與北平敎育機關中人、若輩自覺內心不安、此為絕不足異者、蓋就記者所知、共中若干人確曾致私函予中外友好、謂此舉實與彼等之衷願相違、因受日人恫嚇、故乃迫不得巳、參加此項運動云云、無論此言或虛或實、然被迫出充親日宣傳者、從事政治活動、致惹人注意、而在此混亂時代中、個人生命、常有危險、則確屬事實也、同時、華北華字報紙、逐日從事猛烈之反英宜傳、此等報紙、悉被日方嚴格統制、故絕不能參以己意、報紙宣傳、究竟能否較大會與游行稍有成續、須留待異日覘之、迄今為止、整個迅動、已獲日方本意甚</p>
<p>相反結果</p>
<p>華人今亦竊笑日人謂彼等不能擊敗蔣介石將軍、乃圖自英國獲取勝利、而此種謂日人實處困境之談片、昔僅聞諸有識華人之問、今則已遍佈於各級人民之內矣、</p>

<h3>日方限制外輪駛汕　英輪已堅決拒絕　滬日總領昨通知領事團限制外輪每週進港一次　日軍又圖玉環登陸仍未得逞</h3>
<p>字林報云、日海軍發言人昨日（一日）招待各報記者時聲稱、駐滬日總領事三浦昨日通知領事團、謂日方將准第三國輪船每週駛往汕頭一次、惟須於二十四小時前知照日海軍、日當局暫准各輪在汕頭起岸之物、以供給第三國人民之食物與郵件兩種為限、日當局對於各國僑民旅汕僅餘一二人者、巳請各該國常局、將若輩之郵件交由每週駛汕一次之輪船載往、或詢自天津起椗、定星期六日駛抵汕頭之雲南號輪、已否到達、發言人答、渠求接此項消息、但該輪若已通知日常局、則或巳准許駛入矣、又稱、對福州之海軍行動、未嘗吿畢、關於第三國人民撤退事、似已就地商妥云、</p>
<p>英輪堅持繼續駛汕</p>
<p>英商太古怡和兩公司、為維持閩粤航行計、除派新北京輪、由滬駛福建之泉州外、行駛上海香港聞各輪、決兼灣廣東之汕頭、計由滬開港之英輪、四日為廣東輪、五日為裕生輪、七日為貴生成都、八日為瓊州和生、對於日方之阻撓、決予拒絕、現汕頭泉州等處、均泊有英艦、保護商輪航行、</p>
<p>玉環激戰日軍不逞</p>
<p>本埠航案界息、（一）玉環登陸日軍、自華方大批生力軍開到反攻、即吿克復後、一日下午三時許、玉環洋面、停泊日艦五艘、突向岸上開砲達四十餘發、放下汽艇十餘艘、滿載日軍、在砲火掩護下企圖登陸、華軍俟日汽艇駛近、用機關槍猛烈掃射、展開激戰、卒因華軍防範週密、日軍未能得逞、二日晨、復到日艦二艘、向岸上發砲轟擊、華方損失甚微</p>
<p>日機日艦繼續轟浙</p>
<p>日艦現不時放下汽艇游弋、華軍仍在嚴彬戒備中、（二）溫州一日晨七時許、有日機六架侵入投彈、並在樂淸投彈達五六枚、（三）穿山洋面、停泊兩日艦、二日晨九時、向岸上開砲十餘發、（四）閩江口外、現停泊日艦八艘、一日晨向館頭開砲、當地防軍、亦予還擊、聞義商康沙義輪、於前日由溫返滬、當晚靠埠、該輪於經過玉環江面時、日艦會以旗語詢問、並未遭遇阻撓、</p>
<p>日艦窺伺椒江戒備</p>
<p>據航業界消息、浙東海門港口、一日晨到日艦五艘、放下汽艇、在沿海游弋窺伺、似有所企圖、惟海門椒江口、當局早巳實施封鎖、禁止通航、並派有重兵駐守、防務極為嚴密、日軍如有企圖、決靴如願、並悉浙省軍事常局、已下令戒備、防日軍在沿海各地偷襲、</p>
<p>福溫兩地繼續疏散</p>
<p>閩浙海面停泊大批日未他去、除不時向沿海發砲轟擊、尙無具體行動、華方精銳部隊、源源開到佈防、防務史為嚴密、目下福州溫州居民、當局繼續疏散、情形尙稱安謐、</p>
<p>溫州同鄉接洽派輪</p>
<p>溫州旅滬同鄉會公吿云、「査甌滬交通、自時局趨於嚴重、發生阻梗之後、凡吾溫屬同鄕、容有亟欲返里料理事務、只以航運中斷、苦於無法首途、本會有鑒於此、特商請某輪公司、派輪兼灣沙埕、以便轉道返里、各同鄕如欲回鄕、請於七月三日上午十二時以前、來會辦理登肥手續、俾與前途商洽、特此通吿、該會辦事處在南京路拋球塲天綸大樓三樓十號、</p>

<p>謀福卸貨尙未完竣</p>

<p>新北京輪開抵泉州</p>
<p>英商太古公司、為維護在華航權、對沿海各口岸航輪照常開行、新北京輪於一日上午直放閩省泉州、據該公司接電吿、沿途甚為安謐、將於今晨可抵達、惟華方軍事當局、已禁止一切船隻出入泉州、故僅能在口外停泊、客貨用駁船轉卸、</p>
<p>神華抵滬神愛抵三</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向英商行探悉、（一）由溫州折回上海之神華綸、已於咋日下午二時抵滬、泊楊樹浦第三十號至三十一號浮筒、（二）神愛輪電滬報吿、巳山川石裝貨、安抵三都澳、（三）神佑神福兩輪、暫泊上海、（四）神光仍泊川石、所裝之貨一千四百噸、尙未卸竣、至於滬閩問航行、暫時並無船隻行駛、因福州川石之形勢、依然嚴重、</p>
<p>兩英輪過汕未進港</p>
<p>字林報云、據上海昨（一日）接消息稱、六月二十八日、英輪廣東與西斯坦兩號、泊距汕頭市八里之砂洲時、汕頭顯未封鎖、除日驅逐艦一艘之外、兩輪旅客、未見其他日艦、惟兩輪被英驅逐艦偵察號阻於砂洲、據偵察號艦長聲稱、渠接訓令、於英日當局談判未畢時、攔阻英輪云、乘廣東輪之駐汕頭瑞典辦事專員之妻兒及另一西婦、以及西斯坦輪之美籍旅客一人、均已轉乘偵察號英艦前往汕頭登岸、該兩輪皆駐有武裝衛兵、各計水兵四名、</p>
<p>英海軍當局勸離汕</p>
<p>泊砂洲幾八小時後得英海軍當局勸吿離汕、謂因談判展緩、復須泊待二十四小時也、兩輪乃於二十八日午後二時駛離汕頭、汕頭港中雖有日軍運輸艦約二十艘、惟停泊砂洲外商輪之搭客、顯未見汕頭封鎖、或日海軍巡邏、僅見驅逐艦一艘、及武裝汽艇六艘、亦無空軍活動、僅見日水上飛機一架、低飛過港、前往汕頭以南十五哩之好望角、（譯文）衆意、因英海軍當局不欲在談判進行時、發生任何種不幸事件、故阻英輸入港、</p>

<h3>財政部批准備案　匯劃新制明日實施　組檢査會增加市塲籌碼　杜絕投機穩定滬市金融</h3>
<p>上海銀錢業為調劑同業資金、供應工商需要、實行新滙劃制度、業經財政部批准備案、以後若杜絕投機事業、穩定金融市塲、票據交換集中辦法決定之後、同時實行、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>提供担保領用滙劃</p>
<p>銀錢兩業同業公會議决自七月四日起、辦理各行莊領用同業新匯劃後、各行莊均已提供財產準備、向銀行聯合準備會登記、俟該會評定價値核准領用後、即由該會轉收各行莊同業往來戶、並發給支票簿、以憑支用、該項支票、即新匯劃、係由各行莊蓋章簽字發出、由準備會憑票支付、凡持此新匯劃者、必要時得向準備會換為匯劃證、與銀準備會之本票、同樣行使、外商銀行已允充作抵軋頭寸之用、並贊同是項新匯劃制度、</p>
<p>推定委員成立檢會</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行準備委會探悉、關於銀錢業同業匯劃準備檢査委員會之組織、自由銀行準備委會函請推派委員後、聞上海市商會銀錢兩業公會洋商銀行公會曁中中交農四行、均已內定委員人選、決俟委員人選報吿後、即行開首次委員會宣吿成立、至於檢査匯劃準備日期、擬於每月之月終、並將領用同業匯劃之担保品種類數額、及領用數額分別公吿、以昭大信、</p>
<p>法幣緊縮增加滙劃</p>
<p>上海情勢特殊、地位方面、雖成孤島、然其金融勢力之影響、仍足以左右中國一部分金融局勢、例如國際間之匯兌、仍以上海為中心、財政部鑒於如果為增加市塲籌碼、而照舊盡量供給法幣、則法幣流出過多、不免入於奸人之手、適足以助長投機之勢、所以對於上海之法幣、竭力設法緊縮、如限制携帶法幣至滬、及統一各債改在重慶付款、茲為應付上海目前之需要、銀錢業辦理領用同業匯劃、實為解決市塲籌碼之良法、</p>
<p>財政諿已批准備案</p>
<p>關於新匯劃制度、會由銀錢業公會呈報財政部、業巳奉部令批准備案據新聲社記者向銀錢業探悉、八二二後之匯劃、與從前之隔日收現之匯劃、其性質遂不相同、然因市塲法幣之用途為一般的、以滬市人口之多、日常生活所需、均須以法幣支付、因此八一三以後之匯劃、事實上不足以應付上海目前之需要、自新匯劃制度實行後、能使普遍的流通且能轉匯內地採辦土貨之用、可謂與法幣同樣行使、</p>
<p>銀行錢莊集中交換</p>
<p>銀錢兩業議决集中票據交換所後、錢業準備庫採用委託代理交換方式、參加銀行票據交換所、該庫之會員錢莊四十二家、均委託錢庫代理、銀行票據交換所特設五十號（泉）（即代表錢業準備庫）交換台、對該庫代理之四十二家會員錢莊列為第一號至四十二號、準定七月四日起實行、至於錢業原有交換所、則照常辦理各錢莊之票據交換、時間為每日下午一時至二時、</p>
<p>第二步籌發滙劃證</p>
<p>據新新社記者向銀行界探悉、銀錢兩業匯劃領用手續、（一）領用行莊先提供財產作担保品、（二）經評價委員會評定担保品之價格、（三）由銀行聯合準備委員會按照評價會評定價格百分之七十、轉收各行莊匯劃往來戶、發給支票、以憑支用、（四）各行莊所簽發支票、概由銀行準備會劃付、該項支票、即為同業匯劃、可流通市面、但為便利各業問授受起見、銀行準備會第二步將籌發同業匯劃證、刻正在擬訂章則、將規定發行數額及種類、</p>
<p>取締貼水杜色投機</p>
<p>財政部之馬電限制提存以及銀錢業之安定市面辦法實行後、上海之金融市塲、此後將愈趨穩定、能（一）杜絕上海市塲投機風潮、安定市面、（二）鼓勵資金內移、加强抗戰基礎、關於滙劃票據之貼水、此後或將自行消滅、又新聲社記者昨向錢兌業同業公會探悉、上海之錢兌莊、戰後激增、加入為該會會員固多、而不得加入及未加入者亦多、經營匯劃貼水之錢兌莊、多非該會會員、該會已勸吿會員、注意此項匯劃貼水、以免助長投機者之勢、</p>
<p>市塲穩定恢復常態</p>
<p>新匯劃制度實行後、上海市塲增加新的籌碼、能使各業不致再感籌碼缺乏、所以證券·雜糧·麵粉·紗布·豆米·糖·南北貨等市塲、均定三日或四日起開市、因籌碼增加市塲交易、逐漸恢復常態、又近一週來上海市面謠傳之新流通券、業經各方面之證實不確、因在中國現法幣政策、極端穩定之下、並未需要、且亦害多利少、而反引起市面之波動、</p>
<h3>法租界衛生處　積極防疫　强制民衆注射從第一區入手</h3>
<p>連日天時冷熱不一、以故各種時疫應時而生、數亦激增、尤以傷寒霍亂為最、兩租界衛生處、雖通吿市民、前往各衛生處注射防疫針、而一般民衆、每多規避、法租界衛生處、為此不得不採取斷然手段、分派大批人員、會同巡捕出發至第一區（即外灘至敏體尼蔭路愛多亞路至毘運華界）各處、沿途强迫民衆注射、以策市民之安全與健康、此項工作、待至市民均已注射而後止、然後再往其他各區進行、</p>

<h3>巴德生醫生（上）　仁濟醫院的三難</h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>「我老實吿訴你，眞抱歉，」巴醫生放低了喉嚨對我說：「在最近七年之內，除了在國體中一起拍過照之外，我簡直想不起我會攝過單身像片。」這是仁濟醫院院長巴德生醫生，在我訪問他時，臨別向他要一張照片的當兒，他在一本貼照相簿中，翻之又翻，然後在含笑而謙卑之中，率直地對我所說的幾句話。</p>
<p>從前或最近曾見過巴德生醫生（Dr．J．Lee　H．Paterson，M．B．，Ch．B．）的—在上海住的人認識他的恐不在少。而且，不是一定生過病的纔有機會碰到他，譬如，仁濟醫院附設的護士學校，歷屆畢業的護士小姐們，那就不在病人之列哩—總能想得起他是怎樣一位人。至少對於代表他所執的高貴業務的一襲醫生穿的白色外罩褂，發生了可敬，友愛而當有責任性的印象罷。</p>
<p>踏進了山東路（由北南行）上三「老」—點綴着斷碑殘碣，兼有故園風緻的外國墳山；始創同治十一年，日銷十五萬份的申報；上海最古全國第二，基督敎所辦的麥家圈仁濟醫院—之一的The　lesterChinese　Hospital（仁濟醫院）心中不由得大為感謝：我旣不是「被送進，」—本埠新聞中幾乎沒有一天沒有的—也不是「去探望」我去的時候是下午二時牛，正是大家探望親友病人的時候—而是「來訪問」那穿着白外掛的巴院長。</p>
<p>…問訊處，掛號處，賬房，配藥問，手術室…醫生，護士，院役…新愈而扶着。走路的，抱着萬分痛苦，頭上蒙着被單，而來就醫的，橫臥在病架上，被推進電梯而上昇的重病者……那里不是巴醫生麼！</p>
<p>在一方紅地白字有三個LCH臂章的左手臂脥窩下，他挾了一塊上面貼着病人病狀記錄的版，很忙碌的正對着一個職員講話。右手裏的鉛筆不時戳在記錄紙上；他們兩人對語的中間，他不是用筆端去寫，便是拿筆梢輕輕地，有節奏地，敲在紙版上。似乎四週的一切紛擾，都給秩序，訓練，和經騐征服了。</p>
<p>「呀，S君，請這里來，」我被巴醫生引進了二樓的院長辦公室。</p>
<p>簡單，樸素交織在這一間旣不大，又不小的房間中·我趁巴醫生打電話的時候，舉目觀看，覺得這里是無可再簡單的了。正中一隻大寫字檯，上面有幾樣文具，一架電話，一隻烟灰缸，一些簿籍之類；靠窗一隻小寫字檯，放着幾冊書，一本是翻開着的—無疑的是一册外國一靈素」之類；四壁懸着大小七八張風景照片，也是樸質而不帶濃厚色調的；此外，一兩架書橱，幾把椅子，1隻洗手具而已。</p>
<p>醫生們的時間好像少女的春靑，我們脫略了客套，就開始談話：</p>
<p>「我生於一八八四年五月十五日，今年五十四歲了」。</p>
<p>「最初入康達爾中學，繼入刺得福大學，（巴德醫生解釋給我聽，那是在紐喀斯爾，</p>
<p>巴德生醫生近影阿逢泰因的（Newcastle-on-tyne—泰因是河名，他說。）一九〇六年畢業於愛丁堡大學，獲M．B．，Ch．B．學位。</p>
<p>「一九一二年與卜朗女士Miss　C．M．Brown結婚。」</p>
<p>「平時喜歡打網球，有一時玩過曲棍球」</p>
<p>我順着次序將誕生時日·學歷·婚姻和運動等幾項問着巴醫生。</p>
<p>「那末先生在那一年來華的呢？」</p>
<p>「在一九〇八年二月裏」。巴醫生回答說：「一九〇八至一九一〇年在本院任職；1九一〇至一九一二年在武昌；一九一二至一九二六年在天門皂市。其中一九一六年至一九一九年大戰期中，回國在皇家軍醫隊R．A．M．C．中服役；一九二七年重返上海」。</p>
<p>的確，巴德生醫生對於仁濟醫院具有悠久的歷史關係。因為他於一九二七年返華之後，便繼前院長達文卜醫生（Dr．Davenport）任院長職，直到現在。</p>
<p>經過了十分鐘的談話，我對於巴醫生的過去，差不多已獲得了一個粗略的輪廓。在我們談話的間歇中，我默察坐在我對面的被訪問者，他具有沉毅的態度，明快的精神；豐厚而紅潤的面龐，襯着一對奕奕有光的眼睛，頂上覆着半作銀灰，半作棕絲色的頭髮；在談話當中，他不時把身子靠在椅背上，從安詳自然的歡笑之中，透露出了心胸間的寥廓而大方。</p>
<p>「巴翳生，」我問：「在你管理院務的這許多年中，什麼是感覺最困難的呢」？</p>
<p>「困難麼」？巴醫生回答說：病人多，地位狹，錢不够…那就是不容易解决的幾個難題目哩」。</p>
<p>從巴醫生口中所說的「三難」中，他供給了我幾種數目字··他說，從病人方面講，仁濟醫院的門診人數，平均每天少自八百，多至一千二百；住院病人介於二百八十至三百之間，目下因為百物昂貴，尤其是受外滙高漲的影嚮，藥品的支出就格外可觀。</p>
<p>好像和巴醫生談開門七件事，他額上的縐紋未免漸漸地緊起來；我接着問道：「平均一個住院病人。每天耍多少錢去維持呢」？</p>
<p>「每天大約要兩元六角」，巴醫生慢慢地說：「包括一切費用在內，甚至醫生的服務費」。</p>
<p>普通一個病人，如果每天要他付二元六角的醫藥費，那沒一個月豈不是就要七十八元麼？這在中等以下人家，薪水階段之流的，就要成為很嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>「那沒是不是完全免費的呢」？</p>
<p>「照百分數比例講，免費的病人佔百分之四十五；每天只付六角錢的佔百分之四十；此外每天能付一元至三元或超過三元的，佔百分之十五」，巴醫生回答說。</p>
<p>「這樣說起來，倒有近半數的病人，自己不能出醫藥費的哩」，我說。</p>
<p>「就是這樣說呀一，巴醫生邊說邊站起來，在書架裏拿了兩本一九三七，一九三八的仁濟醫院常年報吿授給我看。</p>
<p>整個的醫院工作成績，和它的經濟狀况，都包括在這四十頁一本的報吿書中。據本年四月中，英商會主席麥歇爾爵士，在仁濟醫院年會充當主席時，他報吿中一段說：「經常賬的支出方面，差不多每一項目之下的費用，都見增加；但因管理上謹愼小心的力量，這比例的增加並不若收入方面比例增加之甚‘。結果支出超過收入不到二千五百元……</p>
<p>以一個偌大的醫院，在經常收支方面能有如此成續，當然不是一件容易的事；據巴醫生說，因為醫院裹略為有些財產，在經常方面，還能勉强敷衍過去。倒是臨時的擴展費用，一時沒有辦法。</p>
<p>「因為病人多，地位狹，我們很希望在屋頂卜添造一層房子」，巴醫生用手向上指着外面的屋子說：「但是預計費用至少要二萬五千元，不僅款尙無着，而且還需要置備用具，和平時的維持費呢。」說到這里，他不禁望着我作一霎間無可避免的「苦」笑。</p>
<p>我們便趁此結束了關於「難」字的問題。（未完）</p>

<h3>在華租界　須立共同陣綫　始足應付日方危險租界影響全部貿易　日方要求永無窮盡之期</h3>
<p>密勒氏評論報云、天津英法租界與鼓浪嶼租界之遭封鎖、漢口法租界與其他特區、暨沙面租界之遭隔絕、以及日方向上海工部局之施加壓力、已使人人熟知遠東之真正局勢矣、在華之泰西租界、無不遭遇共同之危險、且日方壓力刻正迅速侵害泰西之權益、雖日方對付此等特區之行為、動機不一、其在上海·天津·廣州·漢口·與鼓浪嶼壓迫之手段、亦稍互殊、但黷武日本對在華所有非日本之租界、確已從事</p>
<p>包圍隔絕</p>
<p>抵制、封鎖、與經濟絕交之巨大運動、此固絕無疑義矣、全部泰西人士今已盡在一舟之中、關於此等特區、與日作永久佈置之可能性、亦不復有幻想矣、日本對於此點之態度、已根本改變矣、查襄日甚至中日戰爭開始之後、日本仍熱烈贊成在華有租界、無論其為日租界與否、東京仍用此等區域為侵入中國之箭鏃、惟今局勢全非、租界悉在日軍侵佔區中、</p>
<p>控制內地</p>
<p>用作反對租界之根據地、不復視租界為其自己之便利的「彈力跳板」、而以他人侵入其侵佔地之門戶目之、關閉此等門戶、已為日本之確定政策、此項政策現任日外相已一再述明之、日方以其在華所立各偽政府之名義、要求日方所稱之「交還」租界、此項要求迄今未成實在要求之形式、而向有關泰西列強正式提出、但不久將來、諒將提出之、日本目下對特區之「肅清戰」、係準備異日或將實現其減弱西方抵抗之計劃時加以</p>
<p>最後一擊</p>
<p>日方既有此政策、遂頗少妥協之可能、或竟無此可能、痛苦之經騐、已可表示日方向租界每獲一利、必續有要求、而求之不盡、現正一再創其託詞、為採取減少特區獨立之行動作藉口、租界管理機關無論向日方作何讓步、日本軍閥將認每一新的利益、為達其最後目的即廢棄在華外國管理的特區之踏步石而已、泰西列強考慮最後交還在華租界者、已非一次、但所考慮者、惟交還獨立的中國國民政府而已、任何</p>
<p>泰西列強</p>
<p>從未考慮將其在華特區權利移交非中國之列強、尤其絕未考慮將此等權利讓予日本、將租界「交還」予日本製造之偽政權、適與讓予日本無殊、此等偽政權、全由日方主宰、且已充份證明偽政權僅為日方掌握中反西方的歧視之工具而已、</p>
<p>移交租界予此等政權、則美國與歐洲在華商業利益、將受至大損失、日方本身或將放棄其在天津與漢口之租界、因整個</p>
<p>日侵佔區</p>
<p>實已不啻一日本之大租界矣、然泰西人士不能出此、彼等之租界特權、現已成為在日方控制區內繼續商業之主要權利、但日方雖大呼租界歸還中國、日本軍閥對於將其租界交還偽政權事、絕無行動、此點殊堪重視、泰西各國之全部貿易地位、多賴其租界之繼續存在、故兩者有嚴密關係、此語尤適用於上海之公共與法租界、以及天津之英法租界、據貿易統計表所示、此兩口岸</p>
<p>商業交易</p>
<p>之減落、不若全被日方控制各口岸之甚、多因此兩市有租界存在之故、本年最初四月中、中國輸入之經上海天津兩地交易者、幾佔總數之什八、此等輸入、上海所佔者、不下百分之四六·七六、天津佔百分之二七·四、日軍侵佔區輸入之泰西各國貨物、什九以上係經滬津而入中國、此等輸入之所以能維持者、皆因滬津有租界存在、保持獨立的公開銀錢市場、可自由購買外匯、償付入口貨價故也、茍此等情況更變、則滬津之貿易將被摧毀矣、如公共與法租界</p>
<p>一旦廢棄</p>
<p>則上海之西方商業將若何、可想見也、屆時全市將成一「大閘北」、日方到處主宰百事、則「准許·領照·取締·與統制」等事、將層出不窮、出口商不得不按照橫濱正金銀行隨意虛定之匯率而獲得外匯、入口商之外匯不得不視該銀行之意見而定、浦江中之西方船隻、將遇同於青島之情況、吾人將僅使用、「虹口橋」、或日元、吾人之郵件均將受嚴格之檢查、海外寄來之</p>
<p>報紙書籍</p>
<p>將被扣留、南京偽政府將向每人徵稅矣、無人不了悟危險、然對策維何、能為者己竭力為之乎、外國租界與其中居民、均處同一舟中、此點已無爭論餘地、然彼等已合作、而至局勢所需要之程度乎、答曰、未也、此等區域茍自戰事甫起、即密切合作、以堅定之共同政策對付日本、則今茲百事均可妥善應付矣、不幸失此機會、悔之已晚、然上海天津與鼓浪嶼仍保持可予一致抵抗、而非僅消極的忍受苦痛之地位、此數租界之行政機關應</p>
<p>密切合作</p>
<p>至於互相聯絡、交還意見、與互相援助、即在今日、所應為非盡於此、既遇共同之危險、應即團結、共同抵抗與管理、並應儘可能作最密切之合作、而不容稍緩者也、近數週來、在遠東之泰西外交家已在上述特區間、樹立若干直接聯絡與合作、但決非即是已足、泰西外交家務須實行所接本國政府之訓令、而本國政府對於租界之政策、常出於被動、且外交家所需遵循之政策、似不以租界利益為主旨、由是觀之、</p>
<p>在華租界</p>
<p>務須有更密切合作、彼等之利益亟需成立共同陣綫、堅決對付日方之危險、以及本國政府之政策、設今日而有一組人士、無論處於官方或非官方地位、能被一般人認為在華所有特區之發言人、則彼等一致之言論、決議、與行動、其及於日本及泰西本國政府之力量、或勝過特區中各外商所發消極的不平之言也、此一組人士若具有良好之立場、勢力、與獨立、則對於被威脅之泰西在華尤其為在租界之利益、當然</p>
<p>能予保全</p>
<p>並能獲得中國以外之相類的利益之合作、彼英國殖民地菲島及越南之泰西利益方面、均將表示同情、蓋彼等亦必遭遇日本之威脅、此或非目前之事、但一俟日本設法摧毀在華之西方特區、則上述各地之西方利益均將陷於危險矣、事實上非特在華西人、即自新加坡以至海參崴之所有泰西利益、均在同舟中、彼等無論若何競爭、惟堅決維持其固有之地位、以抵制日方之</p>
<p>繼續開拓</p>
<p>則有相同之利益、彼等堅決團結以對付敵人、則不僅於直接抵抗方面、將大有成就、且對本國輿情及政府、將發生強大勢力、而使泰西列強之遠東政策立即復趨活躍、且必較最近之過去為甚、遠東全境之最有勢力的白種人、堅信如此、但僅深信實不足有為、局勢所需者、為思想與行動、重要西僑應取各事於已掌之中、而有所行動、則獲巨大共同之響應、固意中事也、</p>

<p>耳鬢廝磨</p>
<p>混有愛情反變惡劣、則因新婦不慣受翁姑與小姑之歧視、乃集失於新郎、故蜜月之後、巧英籍端歸檸、將　中衣飾攜取而去、邵家即指捲逃、自是兩方乃由親成仇、惟彼倆同居時期雖短、然婦卻經懷孕、近漸腹部隆起如墳、雙方父母、深覺長此參商、總非了局、亦會屢圖解決之策、終以巧英堅欲離異、楚增要求同居、</p>

<p>一、先就各縣小學師資言、二十六年度小學敎員總數、為二九·六二一人、其中百分之四十為小學畢業之學生、其會受師範敎育者、尙不及百分之二十、餘為中學職業學校等畢業或肄業之學生、師資實質如此、欲求基礎敎育程度之提高、以發揚光大民族之精神、自屬困難、欲補救此種缺陷、一面自應積極培養師資、另一面須訓練原有師資、訓練原有師資、如過去舉行小學敎員短期集中訓練、設置師資進修機關、及舉辦檢定試騐、以增進其學識技能、俾直接有益於學生之學業、至於培養師資、依照現有十四校八十三班計、每年畢業生僅有三百餘人、補充原有不合格之敎員、差數極大、若再進一步言、辦理普及敎育、廣設短期小學及戰時民衆學校、則師資之需要量更大、據最近二年度統計、失學兒童尙有一百二十餘萬、失學成年、尙有三百三十餘萬、以每一小學敎員平均敎授兒童三十名計，需培養師資四萬人、每一民校敎員、平均敎授成人三十二名計、需培養師資十萬三千餘人、合計十四萬三千餘人、如此大量師資之培養、决非浙省目前財力所能及、但師資之質的改造與量的擴充、仍不得不逐漸設法救濟、以發展地方敎育、</p>
<p>二、師資之培養與訓練、雖盡力為之、然其待遇若不能改善、則培養與訓練將徒勞而無功、自抗戰以來、小學敎員凡資格學力較强者、大都被共他待遇較優之機關吸收、查現今各種之訓練團隊班所之學員、原為小學敎員者、幾達半數以上、造成本省小學敎育界空前絕大之危機、查本省小學敎員之待遇、有低至月僅二三元者、即以待遇最高之各縣縣立小學敎員言、每月平均所得亦不過十七元餘、維持個人之生活、尙感不足、安能仰事俯畜、至於目前各縣地方敎育、尙能維持不墮者、實有賴於略受敎育而不合資格之壯丁、嗣後地方敎育程度將漸低落、無庸　言、是以提高小學敎員待遇、為發展地方敎育急不容緩之事、</p>
<p>三、過去小學敎員待遇之不能提高、學校設備未能充實、由於地方敎育經費之不足、查各縣敎育經費之來源、以田賦四成附加一成附稅為收入之大宗、益以屠宰稅。騐契稅。置產捐．學產租息·學校之學雜費等、並設縣敎育款產委員會管理之、以保陣敎育經費之獨立、然自專款制度改為統收統支以後、敎育經費之獨立遂失保障、縣敎育經費逐年低落、二十五年度縣敎育經費占地方總經費為百分之二十三弱、二十六年度為百分之十七强、二十七年度降至百分之十一弱、其尤甚者、為二十六年度縣敎育經費預算數與决算數之對比、平均竟有百分之二十九應支而未支、待遇菲蒲之敎員、與設備簡陋之學校、所賴以維持之僅有敎育經費、尙發生欠發挪移等事、實可痛恨、故縣敎育經費應規定標準、保障獨立、！及籌劃增加、以發展地方敎育、</p>

<h3>評『同業滙劃證』領用制度</h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>再度限提現鈔存款後</p>
<p>六月二十二日起，財部再度限制提取存款。每週僅能支取現鈔五百元；逾額得以滙劃票給付。滙劃票不能購買外滙，又不得流用至上海以外地方；雖有非法之貼現市塲，但貼水率頗高。故此令實施後，上海金融市塲即發生下述兩大現象：</p>
<p>（一）市面流通法幣頭寸大缺，一切現鈔新交易大受限制，狂熱之投機市塲於是驟然冷落；飛昇中之投機價格一致猛跌。</p>
<p>（二）由於法幣頭寸缺乏及重用滙劃制度之結果，經巳弭平之滙劃貼現投機，重見抬頭，且較前尤為銳烈。</p>
<p>限制提存之目的，原在防止資金逃避，安定戰時金融。由第一種現象觀之，顯已完成其使命。</p>
<p>惟滙劃可以貼現，資金逃避之門戶顯未完全關閉。貼水率之高漲，雖可縮小資金偷漏之門戶，但力量至微；然其給予物價及平民生計之影響則至·。滙劃不能購買外滙，果係最大之優點；但同時亦不能到內地購買土貨，則不能不謂為美中之大缺點。故各方對於現行之滙劃制度，貶褒不一；從而對於非法之滙劃貼水，亦互有是非。良有以也！</p>
<p>補充辦法與補充通貨</p>
<p>因欲顧全國內貿易，在限提五百元現鈔存款外，不得不另闢一融通機會；而此種融通機會，又必需能不致為逃避資金者所利用。現行之滙劃貼現，固不失為一種融通辦法，但旣使正當商業需要及逃避資金者同受高率貼水之待遇，而尙不能防止資金逃避，反予土產市塲受滙劃貼水之轉嫁，而發生物價高漲，乃至影響其交易與出口。故理想中之融通辦法，至少應具下列性能：即對外直接上固不能購買外滙，間接上亦不能購買外滙；對內雖不經由換成法幣之過程，亦得到處購買土產，並不以上海一地為限。是則在法幣及滙劃票據之外，自應另設一種合乎此種原則之新通貨。但此種新生之通貨，必需不破壊整個通貨市塲之供需關係，叉不損害法幣制度之完整體系為基本條件。故其發行之後，應有收縮法幣之機能；不然即有發生通貨膨脹之危機。但僅限於收縮法幣之流通額，絕對不可篡竊法幣在流通界之地位與威信，不然即為虎作倀，自遭滅頂之禍。</p>
<p>上海銀錢兩業公會，根據上述原則，現已决定倡設「同業匯劃證」領用制度，藉以補救現行限提現鈔存款後對於國內貿易上之不利，並謀革絕現行匯劃貼現給於物價及債權上之種咱流弊。據聞此項「滙劃證」，經由中外銀錢業一致合作而發行，並定於明日起即付之實施，茲先觀其內容為何如？</p>
<p>（一）各行莊以（一）主要貨物，（二）上海市塲有正式市價之公司債票及股票，（三）上海租界內有權益之房地產，提交聯合準備會作担保品；按所微担保品之評價額，領取「同業匯劃證」七成。</p>
<p>（二）各行莊同業間之匯劃，槪用「同業匯劃證」收付。各行莊之匯劃往來戶，則使用聯合準備會發給之特殊支票簿。</p>
<p>（三）「同業匯劃證」，得轉匯內地，供採辦土貨之用。條例上雖未載明一不得購買外滙」及「不得貼現為法幣」之字樣，事實h當然不能購買外滙，不能貼現法幣。</p>
<p>（四）「同業滙劃證」，按担保品評價額七成為最大發行額；担保品價値跌落時即須補充，由市商會，洋商銀行公會，銀錢兩業同業公會，各派代表一人；及中中交農四行合派代表一人，共同組織「發行準備檢查委員會」，每月至少檢查一次。</p>
<p>（五）領用滙劃證之利率及滙劃存款利率，山聯準會每日公定；各行莊則按月結算滙劃存欠息一次；必要時，聯準會得檢查各行莊存放情形。</p>
<p>此種內容，係就報載之領用辦法及檢查辦法兩種條例分析而得。是否再有發行條例？不得而知，依吾人所見，為避免擾亂幣制計，發行條例固可不必有，但對於該項「滙劃證」之性能，似尙應加以明文規定。</p>
<p>「同種業匯劃證」之性格</p>
<p>就上述內容所示；「同業滙劃證」，似與德國「封鎖馬克」之性格宙同，皆能通用於國內，而不能購買外滙。所不同者；「封鎖馬克」在國內可作最後支付，「滙劃證」僅充債務債權雙方之抵消及持為「轉賬」之憑證。同時，「滙劃證」準備確實，並由民間金融界聯合發行，故並無　幣性格，且較無準備之「封鎖馬克」為健全。</p>
<p>準備確實，並由銀錢兩業聯合發行，故興「財富憑證」性質之「銀行公單」同，絕非所謂不兌現紙幣性之「流通券」。所不同者；銀行公單可兌法幣；縱不兌換，亦可充淸算上最後支付之用。此則僅充同業間滙劃之授受與作為「轉賬」之憑證，不能兌現。故性質上叉與滙劃票據同」。</p>
<p>匯劃票不能離上海而使用，否則即需升水；此則可轉匯內地採購土貨而可母需升水；匯劃票信用由私人擔保，此則由銀錢兩業聯合擔保。匯劃票一經貼現，即可購外匯；此則不能貼現，故不能間接逃避其資金。故遠較匯劃票為優！</p>
<p>就其能在國內隨地購辦土貨之性能言，與法幣完全無異。惟法幣能購外匯，此則不可。</p>
<p>「匯劃證之性格，若果如是，則誠屬一種理想之封鎖通貨。此證推行之後，自可得下列四點良好效果：</p>
<p>（一）此證通用之另一面，國內流通界之法幣需要，自可無形取消。流通界法幣頭寸减少，逃避資金及外匯現金等等投機風潮，自可弭平。</p>
<p>（二）此證經轉匯後可向內地採購土貨，則大而可使上海之資金，流入內地；小而無形中可使上海對內地之貿易，維持其平衡。</p>
<p>（三）匯劃證流通量增大同時，現行匯劃票使用量即反比例减少。匯劃貼水投機，自可消滅。</p>
<p>（四）匯劃證與法幣平價，發行量又受準備額及領用擔保比率之限制，故無通貨膨脹之虞；物價不致受其影響。</p>
<p>戰時金融政策之目的：本不外防止資金逃避及調整資金之使用。故吾人對於本市金融界當局倡設之此種匯劃證制度，亟應一致贊助，共同提倡，切實推行。並在實施之前，應各就所見，儘量作建設性之貢獻，以冀成為一盡善盡美之制度。</p>
<p>非改善不可之缺點</p>
<p>同業匯劃證，若果如上述之性格，已堪稱為一理想之制度。惟在發行領用及推行的技術方面，似尙有應加研究之處：</p>
<p>（一）匯劃證之性能，猶無完密之明文規定，如「不得購買外匯」，「不得貼現」等字樣，理應明白列入，免滋疑問，而啟流弊。</p>
<p>（二）担保品內，理應加列法幣及公債。因絕無將法幣及公債兩項財富，檳除於担保品範圍以外之理由。今之未有並列，實莫測高深！若將法幣列為担保品之一，並規定其應繳之法定比率，則其收縮法幣流通量之效力，更為强調。若恐各行莊法幣頭寸因此而過短，妨礙其正當的周旋；則可不必規定其應繳之比率。若因自由以法幣為担保後，即無再以法幣為担保品之人。其實即無人提供，仍有列入之必要。否則足以滋生疑實。若日人倡導之「國際通貨」「貿易通貨」云云，吾人務須避免與之牽混。担保品之旣在隨時評價，故列入公債與列入公司債券與股票並無不便利之處。若將公債除外，復將法幣擯除。則滙劃證在中國流通界將來之地位，及其在中國通貨市塲上為功為罪之地位，即將决定於今日之此種缺點，可以斷言。</p>
<p>（三）匯劃證之發行，能得外商銀行之合作，當山於彼等贊助中國法幣制度，同情維持上海金融，以及為維持其在華之商業上本身所有之必要。此外必在此證能向內地購土產之一點。此種性能，且亦將為匯劃證不致發生貼水之一種有力保證。但所謂向內地，應分淪陷區及非淪陷區二種。此種制度若係法幣之補充通貨，並確具前述之種種性格；則其在非淪陷區內，自然可無條件通用。但在淪陷區內，不無問題。若因此種問題不能解决，而即根本停止對淪陷區內辦貨；固又可收粉碎日方壟斷淪陷區物產的計謀之效。若此種問題旣不能解决，而仍繼續向淪陷區內辦貨。則此證之發行，不啻將現鈔封鎖於上海，專供向淪陷區內採貨；至於對非淪陷區域，則純用此證授受，而不用現鈔。則此證施行之結果，必與其發行目的適得其反！尤非切實謹愼而行之不可！</p>
<h3>評新匯劃及其他</h3>
<p>— 謝菊曾</p>
<p>自從財部馬電到滬，限制行莊存戶每週每人祇准提取法幣五百元，逾限槪付匯劃，祇憑行莊轉賬，以免資金逃避，隨由銀錢兩業公會，議具補充辦法七項，呈准財部照行以來，上海的金融市塲，頓時形成了一個新姿態。在這安定金融新辦法初頒的時候，各界不免有些驚惶，但一經各業領袖的剴切解釋，不久即趨於鎭靜。可是若干方面的觀念，仍有不少誤會的地方，所以筆者不憚繁瑣，特地來糾正一下。</p>
<p>第一，這次限制提存的辦法，雖則與八一三時的安定金融辦法相類，可是動機却完全二樣。八一三時的辦法，是金融界方面主動，而經財政當局核准的。目的在防止提存風潮的擴大，影響銀行錢莊的準備。而這次的新限制，却是遵守財政部馬日的一紙電令，完全由財政當局主動，金融界事前一些兒也沒有知道。所以接電之後，幾位金融巨頭，深夜二時召集會議，事出倉卒可知。不用說，此舉目的，是在鞏固外匯平準基金，防止法幣投機，所以與六月七日的停止按八辦士二五供給外匯，同樣地出以迅雷不及掩耳的措施。但是外間有少數人，誤會此是金融界應付擠提存款的一種治標辦法，特別是西文報紙，以為財部馬電，大有助於華商銀行的擠提風潮，否則將應付不了，其實事實正相反。因為目下上海大多數銀行錢莊，莫不感覺資金過剩。六月七日匯市起了變化以後，雖有不少存戶，提取法幣，轉購外匯，或從事他項投機，在行莊本身，却並不感到擠提的威脅。不過在整個國策上講，這種痛心的現象，自不當聽其長此下去。所以一奉財部馬電，立即遵行惟謹。雖則明知難免引起少數目光淺短的存戶誤會，更恐洋商銀行乘機吸收存款，造成為沿淵　魚的局面，但是兩害相權從其輕，當然顧不了許多。</p>
<p>第二，有人主張今後將上海改為轉帳碼頭，這個原則，是値得贊成的，雖則能否順利實現，及如何促其實現，叉是一個問題。不過如認為將匯劃票據上蓋上轉帳字樣，就可達到目的，似乎太覺容易一些吧！八一三以後的匯劃票據，本來就是轉帳票據，根本不能兌現，安定金融辦法上，早有明白規定。而且銀行發出的匯劃票據，差不多都是三行的撥款單。票據上面都顯明地印着兩條橫綫，這顯是只限銀行錢莊轉帳的明白標記。可是那些祇顧私利，罔識大義—實際即甘冒危險—的人們，連平行綫票據都敢於貼現，故僅僅蓋上「轉帳」二字的戳記還是無效的！</p>
<p>第三，有人慨然於旣行使匯劃制度，限提法幣，就不當再有貼現，否則匯劃依舊可以換成法幣，其結果便等於零。筆者也有同感，如果財政當局及金融業具有決心，這杜絕貼現的事就不難辦到。第一，行莊自己的顧主，凡存匯劃的，必須始終以匯劃支付，存法幣的，不得代為升合匯劃。這在許多會員行莊，大都均能一致遵守的。其次，匯劃票據，特別是平行綫票據，根本不能貼現。小錢莊銀號攬做生客交易，貿然從事，法律當然不予保障。（票據法已儘足應用，無須另定條文。）經過一次二次的訟事，吃過一次二次的大虧，然後大家自然知所歛跡。如果要釜底抽薪的話，則凡經營貼現的莊號，他們收下來的票據，最後一定耍付入會員行莊代為收解，屆時倘相約或奉令不與往來，即足制彼等於死命。而且會員行莊為保障自己起見，對於代收來歷不明的平行綫票據，責任相當重大，原不該冒昧接受的。</p>
<p>第四，七月四日起，銀錢業舉辦的新匯劃五千萬元，此項新匯劃，是上海銀錢業公會為應付目前環境起見，特授權聯合準備委員會辦理，與財政當局無涉，更與縹渺無稽的流通券毫不相干。其次，新匯劃雖則額定五千萬元，並不是一次就增加這許多籌碼。它是具有彈性，隨時視需要的多寡，而為伸縮。行莊每日，就新匯劃交換餘額的數目，簽發支票，由交換所轉賬，照吾人估計，在今後數月中，新匯劃的籌碼，最多決不會超過二千萬元。</p>
<p>新匯劃的特點，是値得稱道的。本來匯劃頭寸之不為外灘銀行所歡迎，完全因為它是一種抽象的籌碼。新匯劃便不同，它的領用，必須以租界內有權收益的房地產，有市價的公司債券股票，及主要物品，經嚴格的評價後，再行折扣，作為擔保。所以它是具有確切準備的一種籌碼，而且它準備的充實，比法幣毫無遜色。加以有洋商銀行代表參加其問，——實際上準備委員會的保管委員，評價委員，向推匯豐麥加利兩行經理及專家擔任——所以今後在外灘銀行間的流通，大致當沒有問題。而本國人士之擁有新匯劃存款者，旣然具有這般堅固的保障，更加用不着擔憂，亟亟於換成法稱，或改買外匯了！至於新匯劃之能轉匯內地，視同法幣，此則舊滙劃也優為之，（因為目下內地資金匯滬，匯水很大，所以匯劃款項轉匯內地，領取法幣，有時且有升水。）初不足表示新匯劃的特色啊。</p>
<h3>中日貨幣戰之回顧與展望（續完）</h3>
<p>— 安石</p>
<p>金系通貨制定論</p>
<p>銀貨復活旣無可能，而新通貨又須可以兌換外滙始足以抗法幣，於是乃有余系新通貨制定論之主張。其法，與英美諸國合作，共同出資，設立準備庫，發行以英美貨幣為單位之外幣，使其流通華中，如此法幣便不難於打倒。</p>
<p>這確也是一法，可是實際上絕無實現的可能。</p>
<p>第一，該準備庫，若以日本勢力為中心而處於支配地位，外人絕不肯參加，因為如此徒為日方所利用而危及自己之經濟勢力；反之，若以英美為中心，則華中金融勢力完全握於英美之手而使日本金融勢力殆歸於盡，這樣日本何必不惜犧牲而發動此次之中日戰爭？</p>
<p>第二，對於國際公理道德姑置勿論，英美代日人打倒法幣，勢必危及中國抗戰前途進而危及其在中國整個經濟勢力，英美金融家倒底非個個都是瞎子，卽使日人肯以華中的鈕利相誘，亦決不會棄大而就小，自取滅亡。</p>
<p>新銀行之設立與新通貨之發行</p>
<p>路路不通，最後無法，便決定了設立新銀行和發行新通貨。這便是華興銀行和華興券。關於華興，本刊早已詳論，恕不贅言。不過我們不能忘記的，就是窮人祗想發財，日人始終想要以華興券代法幣而以所得法幣套買外滙。這假使成功，中國法幣便耍敗北而勝利終歸日圓。</p>
<p>於是，霹靂一聲，來了一個上海黑市外滙之停售，而把日方的新通貨制定政策」打碎無餘。這一著，結果在中日貨幣戰上，又使了中國大獲勝利而日本又吿敗北。因此一致命的打擊，華興券不久的將來必致淪落入地獄！</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>總之，中日貨幣戰，自開始至今，中國總佔上風，沈着應戰，而日本則每戰必敗，現在又因上海黑市外滙之停售而受了致命傷。沒有經濟學識的人們，或以此為中國法幣因不能買得外滙而跌價，可是這僅是片面之談。目前法幣，華興券，日鈔在上海雖都變成無法買得外滙，然而法幣的基礎至為鞏固，在上海非但絕無膨脹的傾向而反有緊縮之現象，劃條之代通貨流通者，即其一證。反之，日鈔及其一某的鈔票，則正在進行着極其惡性的膨脹。兩相對比，法幣的價値又高得多了。</p>
<h3>同業領用匯劃進一言</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>最近金融界有辦理同業領用匯劃之舉，其詳細辦法，具見報端，大致擬定各行號均得提供担保品，向某令融機關申請領用同業匯劃，其總額暫定為五千萬云。此項辦法，可以增加籌碼，調劑金融，原則上無可非議，但施行稍一不愼，結果恐將與財部馬電意旨相背，蓋財部馬電之所以獨對滬市二次限提存款者，要在：</p>
<p>（一）緊縮通貨，務使減少資金之逃避，一方面求外滙暗市之較易穩定。</p>
<p>（二）同時使物價為相常之下落；安定社會。</p>
<p>我金融界務宜體會斯旨，切實奉行，關於貨物押款方面：尤應力事緊縮，同業領用匯劃，稍事鬆濫，勢必致頭寸寬裕，助長投機。物價益復上騰，與財部馬電意旨形成南轅而北轍。方今滬上關統稅收，已非我所有，金融界為調劑正當之工商業而推行少數同業匯劃，寗非膏豺狼以血肉，可不愼歟？</p>
<h3>論轉帳碼頭之建議</h3>
<p>— 潘傳棟</p>
<p>有人主張將上海改為轉帳碼頭，借資周轉，其意在改良現行滙劃制度，將滙劃改為不能貼現之劃帳票據，但吾人以為其困難有二：</p>
<p>第一對洋商貿易仍無法解决，因此項轉帳票據，未必能（實際h不能）具有劃頭功用；對洋商付款仍無籌碼，且外匯不能以轉帳票據掉換，結果對外貿易仍未解决。</p>
<p>第二無法禁止轉帳票據之貼水，蓋因前述原因，法幣需要，仍極迫切，持現鈔者，可乘機取利；而貼現營業，散佈各處，並無官憲，能加禁止，結果與現行匯劃制度，並無差異。</p>
<p>以上所述，猶僅着眼於一般商人。至投機商之困難，尙不必論及。實則此次限制，不過暫時性質。但其原因，即資本逃避，恐不易根除。蓋幕中有某方擾亂金融之故，故非根本設法，即改為劃帳碼頭，仍恐其後花樣翻新，永無寗日。</p>
<p>鄙意以為近一年來投機狂盛。商號利潤之意外增高。皆源於外匯之故。而外匯跌至以前一半而為歷史上空前之事實，其原因之一，即為入超。若不由限制入超着手，一般對法幣貶値，疑慮難消，且終必山外匯之狂縮，物價之猛漲，而形成民不聊生，若政府能設法統制進口，增加出口，對申請數額稍　，尙有辦法，否則金融穩定，殆不可望。</p>

<h3>明日施行的　新滙劃制之前途</h3>
<p>— 慕傑</p>
<p>當八一三戰事旣作，財部即有安定金融辦法之施行，為維持各業所需之資金起見，復有四行聯合貼放委員會之設置，然其時工商停頓，人民內移，對於資金需求，尙不急要；且貼放會對金融業猶有直接押貼與轉押貼之故，銀行對於提存尙不無補救辦法。今日之情形異於是，各地人民之集於租界者，資金之存儲與週轉，均以銀行為其樞紐。及六二二再度限制提存，又値外匯突縮之後，安得使人心不更形徬徨，而起絕大恐慌，遂使照額提現者，擁擠不堪，各行莊旣感支多於收，貼放會又早已停止對金融業直接放款，則其現鈔之接濟，惟有求之於銀錢業準備會庫各行莊匯劃存款之調換法幣，吾人從「行莊為應付存款須提前調取」之說，可窺見一斑矣。然市塲籌碼因新限制之故，仍感缺乏，故為調劑同業資金供應工商業之需要起見，再辦理領用同業匯劃事宜；並為便利同業匯劃之授受起見，發行同業匯劃證。此種辦法無論從理論上與事實上言之，要為增加上海市場籌碼最佳之方法。蓋目今上海金融之安定與工商資金之供應，應在法幣數量收縮匯劃數量擴展之原則下進行，以免法幣為日人獲得套買外匯而收扶助正當工商業之效也。</p>
<p>現在銀準會之同業匯劃，與八一三後所構成者本質上已發生差異；　舊匯劃之產生係根據銀錢業所議安定金融補充辦法而來，其實質為銀錢業之負債，即銀錢業所出本票與商業部往來之餘額。新匯劃（即同業匯劃，下倣此）則以各行莊財產為準備而產生之新籌碼。　舊匯劃僅能於同業間轉賬，匯劃款項之所有人，其能表示資財價値者為一票據型之支票而已。新匯劃因便利授受起見有匯劃證之發行，銀準會對於匯劃支票之付款除轉賬外，可以匯劃證支付之；匯劃款項之所有人，能以一貨幣型之匯劃證表示其資財之價値。　舊匯劃因祇能以支票而流通，故其行使受支票法之限制。新匯劃除以支票而流通外，並得以匯劃證流通，且匯劃證遇有汚損破爛得換發新證，及除領用行莊外，不得申請掛失止付，因無異於鈔票也。是則新匯劃之木質遠勝於舊匯劃者多矣。</p>
<p>雖然，市上貼水掉現之門，不因舊匯劃二千二百萬元之法幣放出，與夫同業匯劃之行使，而即關閉。銀行對於匯劃存款人所支付者，即為同業匯劃之支票或匯劃證。設新匯劃之所有人非需用法幣不可，勢必出諸貼水掉現之一途。更設新匯劃之所有人需用法幣，並非由於商業用途，而係資金逃避者，即由於商業用途，而係非關民生之奢侈品進口外匯者，固間接予上海外匯暗市以威脅也。原夫舊匯劃所以不為人重視，正為外商銀行有不願收受此種票據，而一般進口洋行亦以其不能直接轉購外匯，因之不得不換為法幣，遂有貼現之舉。今新匯劃準備檢查委員會所以有洋商銀行公會代表之參加，使其信用推及於洋商收用宜可無問題。惟新匯劃之不能購外匯也如故；且新匯劃尙未施行，各業如綢緞，五金，彩印，精煉各業已登報通吿概用法幣，如以匯劃付款者，按照當日市價貼水，此舉雖非對付將近施行之新匯劃，然銀行所付給匯劃存款人者即為新匯劃，則於其流通上至少有相當之妨碍，而貼水恐難杜絕也。</p>
<p>或謂新匯劃行使之後，必與錢兌業合作，禁止一般小錢莊與銀號經營匯劃貼水，要知貼現如果有需要，豈空言禁止所能見效。有以為即不能禁止，銀準會不再出而維持，一任貼現率之高翔，而從法幣頭寸收縮與匯劃籌碼流通上設法便其圓滑運用，則一時雖仍有貼現之事，但日久法幣頭寸緊縮，彼經營貼現者至此地步，縱有行市，亦必極高，縱有成交，亦必極少，而新匯劃之發生何種現象，就吾人目前加以預測者；　為貼水日漸高漲，彼正當商業交易，如可設法避免用現幣以購貨款者，自不願出重價掉換法幣，（如六·二二限制提存後，貼水雖高，但已有行無市），此時再有以匯劃貼現者，必屬於非正當之用途。　彼正當商業交易旣不願以匯劃貼現購貨，則工商業之現在用法幣交易之原則，其勢必難堅持，否則顧客望望然去之，豈非自行放棄營業之機會！結果匯劃或得順利流通，　彼洋行之兼營進出口業者。收用匯劃款項之後，可以之採辦土貨出口而滋生外匯，用以購進洋貨；果如此說，彼專營進口者祗有匯劃之收進，專營出口者有外幣或法幣之收進，進口洋行必致向出。洋行貼水購進法幣，給購外匯，或直接以較用法幣購買為多之匯劃，購進一定額之外匯。結果進口洋貨價値之增减將視出口土貨價値之多少而定，於是貿易得以平衡，或進口雖仍超過出口，則必形成外人之投資。　現象貿易上之平衡或形成投資，益以法幣籌碼减少，匯劃籌碼增加，上海暗市外匯上貿易時其他的壓力减輕，行市有趨於穩定及放長之可能性，　現象物價，雖暫時不因法幣收縮外匯放長而下降，至少漫無止境上漲之趨勢得以停止。</p>
<p>惟此種預測之效果，其成效必遲，且仍建築於匯劃之能圓滑流通，與市塲法幣之能收縮之原則上，而匯劃之能順利流通，尤須在專營進口與出口洋行間匯劃與外匯收支之調撥與平衡，如何促其實行？否則進口洋行祗有匯劃收進，無法轉化外匯，日久必將拒收，進口洋行拒收於前，其他各業必將拒收於後，重蹈舊匯劃覆轍豈不可惜！以是筆者提供一得之愚，略論如上。</p>

<h3>無性慾與無性力　應有嚴格的區別</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞大醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>剛發育時期的靑年，應知春機發動，並非生殖器完全成熟之謂。故對於性行為，不可行之過早。語曰：「瓜果之生摘者，不適於口，故結婚過早，决非所宜。一方妨害身體之發育，並又不易得健全之子女，故男女結婚，須待廿歲之後，然照近代的醫學觀察，則夫婦問之相差年齡，應以性慾為準。蓋夫婦有同居之義務，其結合也，不問如舊法之為宗祧關係，或如新法之為戀愛關係，而要皆以性事為唯一之事，則夫婦之結合，自應以性慾為準，男性性慾，有至老而不衰者，而女性性慾，普通在四十五歲而巳吿絕，但有無性慾為一事。能否舉行性事為又一事。男子性慾，雖有至老而尙不衰者，然其舉行性事能力，不過六十歲而止，蓋男性居於自動地位，非有相當之精力，縱有性慾，亦甚難為性事。女性性慾，雖至四十五歲而即衰，然其性行為，尙可至六十歲以上，蓋完全居被動地位，宛如器械，縱無性慾，亦尙可行其性事也。以故老男配少女，或少男配老婦，在生理及衛生上，皆非所宜，蓋老男配少婦，在少婦性慾正旺，急求解決，而在老男者則有性慾，亦將以精力不濟，不能行其性事，於是在老男一方已殫精竭力，而在少婦一方，仍未滿足，其結果必致男女兩方皆蒙其害，在男子則發生神經衰弱，腰病，腎虧，以至於死亡，而在女性則發生神經病，如長此以往，易變性的不感，然最好的補救方策，莫如趕快增進其精力，使生殖機能返老還童，以消滅其腎虧，陰萎，未老先衰，神經衰弱等病，余為性病專科醫師，知欲達到上述的返老目的，惟有服以德國雄壯動物睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」方能如願以償，其女用「補體康」為調經種子，及治療不感症的名藥。故余敢推薦於病家。</p>

<h3>最標準白濁劑</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>淋病一症，其來勢甚為凶猛而治愈復不容易。以致患者焦苦萬分。雜藥妄投，冀其早日奏功。結果，未有不使人失望者。原來淋病治療，實一艱難之事。不能隨便作為處置。此種責任，惟富有經騐之醫師所措施的治療法，始克有濟。無如一般淋病患者，不知本身之利害，私自濫服市上劣藥，使本來可以速愈之淋病，變成難愈，蓋要求淋病之根本解决，貴於選醫擇藥是否得當，庶幾可以將淋病早日就愈之希望。此選擇淋病治愈之秘訣也。而淋病內服藥方面，尤當注重，因許多經濟不裕之病家亦能得根治之機會。</p>
<p>惟市上成藥，幾如雨後春笋，病家選擇，恒覺為難。而據余之經騐，惟德國彼德博士所發明之「克淋儂」一藥，足可打倒一切不合理之市上成藥。因「克淋儂」為世界各國最具權威之淋病專家所親自試騐。證明其對淋病上有獨特之成功。因為「克淋儂」服後於數小時內，即發生抗淋噬菌作用，所以實際上於數小時內即發生實效。其二為「克淋儂」殺菌功效之徹底，普通一般淋病內服藥，功效旣鈍，而且僅及於表面的局部，如淋菌已逃入深部而廣泛處，則一般成藥，即毫無功效。其三藥性王道，故服之保證無不良之副作用。由於以上之衆長，故服「克淋儂」無往而不利。舉凡淋毒性攝護腺炎，畢丸炎，尿道炎，膀胱炎，關節炎等，服之無不短期內奏功。外用藥則男子可用「抗淋水」女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，則奏功更速。</p>
<h3>怎樣鎭服肺癆</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺癆是一種可怕的疾病，而是一種最慢性的疾患，治時旣費長久的時日，而又需大量的金錢，故有人說肺癆病乃富貴病，就是說此病有錢人才够生此病的資格，無錢的人只有死路一條，那其實不然，不論任何肺病，以余歷年經騐所得，「補肺拿爾」一藥，確為統治初二三期肺病之特效劑，因該劑有滅除肺病酸素之功，而使肺病菌失去其活動力，故癆症喀血，胸痛盜汗及潮熱，服之無不霍然，而對鎭咳去痰，不必假外科之手術，而能彌補肺部空洞，歐美各大肺病療養院與專家，無不以此劑指示病家自宅服用。</p>
<h3>遺精靑年的健康問題</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>十個靑年九個要遺精，這是什麽緣故呢？雖說遺精有生理與病理的區別，但是我們做醫生的每每發現一個遺精而喪失健康者，都由生理的遺精開其序幕，就可曉得本症若不隨時加以注意，漸能由疏而密，或竟由夢遺而變成滑精，則其勢已入兇險之境矣。</p>
<p>自凟之靑年，本症幾屬難免，若不根絕其病因，雖服藥治療，亦難恢復健康，這點須請　溺自凟者，加以深切的反省，尤其是剛發育的靑年，其每一點一滴的精血，都是築成腦力與肌肉的主要成分，所以不應浪費。</p>
<p>遺精若不早治，則必陷入神經衰弱的病困中，且將釀成其他性病，本症治療之步驟，攝養與劑並重，患者應嚴禁房事過度，禁飲酒類，睡眠充足，如能施行冷水摩擦局部，則尤為有益。</p>
<p>至於藥劑治療，最佳者道推「耐而斯遺精片」，就可澈底根治，不過如若因遺精過久，而使神經衰弱，或有性的障碍毛病，則應兼服「補體康」以培補虧損。</p>

<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>急性白濁，人皆以其痛楚不堪，而貿然治療，結果，痛楚雖暫時減少或平復，然此不過是一種麻醉式之止痛法，未幾，痛楚較前更屬厲害，此時患者始憬然覺悟自身病患之轉劇，而思改易他圖矣。故當淋病初起時，切勿委諸庸劣醫家之手，致本來可以速治之急性白濁，誤於一班不解淋病原理之醫生，濫施手術，及濫服劣藥，只圖眼前片時之奏功，而忘却病家將來之禍害，豈非病家求醫擇藥之不愼，而造成之僵局。</p>
<p>急性白濁，大多發見於與不潔之神女交媾之後，約經過三四天至五六天之潛伏期，即有因前驅症出現。如小便刺痛灼熱不快等皆爲前驅期之現象。其後此等症狀益形加劇，尿道口紅腫龜頭包皮等更腫大得可怕。膿血等之分泌液擁塞尿道，以致排尿亦感十分痛苦，惟此等痛苦，實乃生理上之反應，不可貿以加以麻醉，反而減低抵抗力量，要之根本止痛之法，在於根除淋菌。關於此等療法，惟有服用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，並一方輔用德國静電療法，因「克淋儂」服後能扑滅淋菌，並消除因淋菌所發失之炎症，蓋惟有迅速扑滅淋菌，才是根本解决急性淋痛苦之法，而要達到此種鎭痛抗淋消炎之目的，自不得不採取「克淋儂」及静電等療法爲足恃也　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角。並贈價值一元之「性病全書」一册</p>

<h3>英女樂演戲</h3>
<p>泰西戲塲之事，與中國迥異。其班內著名之人，外人相待亦有禮貌，非中國賣技者流，羣以江湖目之也。茲上海有新到英國當今彈琴婦女名家，名亞拉白拉可大者。其來中國，蓋為繞歷世界，藉廣遊覽之樂也。每於所歷之處，偶施其技，輒嫌得款不及英國百分之一，聊補遊費而已。聞於即日在上海西人戲院，演技數日，車水馬龍，必極一時之盛也。</p>
<h3>新式小車</h3>
<p>二輪小車，為上海最新創設之舉。租界通衢，皆已見斯項新式車矣。其車來自東洋，名為若尼里少，係數年前所創設者，該國人見其有益，因廣用之，現橫濱一處，已有千餘輛，車夫拉之甚捷，與馬車馳驟，幾為相仿也。若與本地之獨輪車相比，則亦有長有短。其所短者，在於僅能載一人；而其長處，則為坐者較便。且本車粗陋，自尊者多不屑於乘焉，若不能家內自置一轎，每苦區於行。今設二輪車，此輩當方便多矣。</p>
<h3>中西字典告成</h3>
<p>昨蒙英士師夫德君，賜中西字典一本。書內彙集華字四千餘，皆按部排列，各字之下，釋以英義，甚為詳明簡要。按此書格式，淸晰之至，於攻西學者，大有裨益。其書已寄存老泰興與別發兩洋行發售矣。</p>

<h3>上海的詩歌朗誦</h3>
<p>— 林嘯</p>
<p>上海的詩歌朗誦，第一次在一家私人的客堂樓上舉行的。到會的有詩人，作曲家，和戲劇家。因為詩歌朗誦是需要音樂性鶴戲劇式的動作來助成其功效的。</p>
<p>那灭朗誦的詩歌有：白曙的「台兒莊」，馮沅君的「撤退」，石靈的「影子」，俄國普希金的「茨岡」，以及錫金的「春日多雨」和華鈴的「鼈-烏龜」等等。其他歌唱有「思鄉曲」（駱駝歌，張昊曲，）　「我從鄉下來」（詞曲作者同上）；唱片有Old　folks，at　Home等，以及英詩朗誦唱片是濟慈的一首詩。</p>
<p>那天的詩歌朗誦，只能作為上海的詩歌朗誦的一種試驗。根據以上各家詩歌的朗誦，我的全部的意見是：因為各家詩歌的不大眾化，所以許多連我這個「知識分子」的「眼睛」也認不得的字眼，怎能以大眾們的「耳呆」來聽得出呢？又如石靈的「影子」，含義深刻調子感傷，更不宜作為詩歌大眾化的基本路線的詩歌朗誦。其次，那天朗誦白曙的「台兒莊」的一位沈小姐，無疑是獲得非常的成功的，因為她能抓到「台兒莊」的詩人在寫作它的時候的全部（至少是大部份）的情感的緣故；相反，某女詩人在讀普希金的「茨岡」的時候，就差得多了。從這裡我們可以曉得：朗誦別家的詩歌，至少要把握住那詩歌的情緒，如果朗誦自己的詩歌，那末聲調就得非常注意（這在朗誦別家詩歌也是重要條件之一。）</p>
<p>我已經說過：那天的詩歌朗誦，只能作為上海的詩歌朗誦運動的一種試驗，因為是試驗，所以我再提供一點意見如下：以後我們再舉行詩歌朗誦的話，我覺得每朗誦一首詩後，大家就來加以一番討論；如詩歌的本身是不是朗誦性的，朗誦該詩的聲調以及運動是否適合等等。這里，我覺得應請不懂詩歌的所謂大眾來諦聽詩歌的朗誦，然後徵求他的意見，這是對上海詩歌朗誦運動的進展是有莫大的幫助的。</p>
<p>上海的詩歌朗誦，除了上述的一種「詩人·作曲家·戲劇家」的集會外，值得大提一提的，還有某一次的××同樂會上，在四五百人的大眾面前來公開朗誦。那天朗誦的詩歌有高爾基的「太陽的昇起與降落，」和許幸之的「路燈塔」（刊詩人業刊「我歌唱」上）。前者由朗誦「台兒莊」的沈小姐朗誦，加以詩歌朗誦在上海的大眾面前還是一位「生客」，所以「聽眾」是用驚奇的沉默來聽完的。後者即「路燈塔」雖然詩歌的本身因為是敘事詩，頗適於朗誦，可是因為朗誦者的朗誦技術太差，又兼「路燈塔」很長，所以聽眾不耐煩起來，不等朗誦完畢，有的悄悄地走了，有的卻交頭接耳地談起話來。</p>
<p>上海的詩歌朗誦運動，并不見得出色，但是詩歌朗誦之在上海究竟還是一枝嫩芽，況且上海的氣候對於那枝嫩芽又是非常的有害，因此，我對於那兩次的詩歌朗誦，抱着莫大的敬意，懷着無限的希望</p>
<p>這枝嫩芽一定是會發榮滋長成為一棵勁強的大樹的，只要我們的詩歌工作者不斷地努力下去！</p>
<h3>火綫上</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>－戰地追記</p>
<p>平漢綫南段的戰爭，經過了相當時期的膠着狀態，他們又突然蠢動起來，其唯一目的，乃在威脅武漢，這是不言可喻的；但光由固始一綫，由於×××師的奮勇抗禦，陣地卻始終沒有變動，所謂信陽放棄云云，簡直等於白晝見鬼。我們本決從商回皖，聽到酬戰的信息，便恢復原定計劃，往前綫一行，然後再轉道入皖。一到信陽縣境，就會懷念，到江南的景色，縱橫交錯的阡陌間，鋪滿了黃金色的田禾，農民們都在進行着收穫的工作，嚓嚓的鐮刀割稻聲，跟滿水的流聲合奏着交響曲。原來信陽地據淮水上游，全是一片廣漢平疇；南部的大別山脈遙遙拱列，平靖，九里，武勝三關，雄踞其上，形勢非常險要；平漢綫的隧道，即傍武勝關穿鑿，宛如信陽門戶，雞公山就在九里關之北。因此，這兵家必爭的要隘，四郊便燃起了爛熳的烽煙。</p>
<p>鄉間的空氣，似乎還很平靜；但一上前綫，便立刻感到緊張了。野戰炮的咆哮，那麼隆隆地震動着，輸送車交織地在飛馳，從樹木中穿過去，又穿過來。勇敢的武裝鬥士們，有的整隊而行，閃耀著的槍刺，射出強烈的光亮，有的在田勝中往來躑躅，唱着衝鋒的歌曲，有的在臨流汲水，洗滌他們的戰衣。一羣羣的戰馬，逍遙自在地啮着青草，把尾巴揮動着，發出蕭蕭的鳴聲。總之，前綫的一切，都會使你感到異樣的情調，而深覺自己的渺小，平凡，及卑怯來。</p>
<p>當我們走向接近火綫的一個村子，饑餓燃燒著沒人的胸腹，吳小姐正在四處索搜包穀（玉蜀黍），預備解決晚飯問題時，而村中的老農，已經送了一籃煮熟的雞蛋來。「如果要吃大米稀飯，那就要等著熬出來，」他誠意的說，從打疊著的額紋中，顯出慈祥的笑容。</p>
<p>「對不起，雞蛋好得很！」</p>
<p>「你們不怕炮火嗎？」老姚輕率地問道。</p>
<p>「不怕；怕什麽？它打毀了我們的肉體，打不死我們愛國的靈魂呀！」老農也許是一位哲學家，這樣幽默地回到着老姚的問話。</p>
<p>黃昏將近，炮聲響得越發起勁了，小鋼炮也在狂吼着，吁吁吁的子彈，像流星似的道竄過去，同時，炮彈落地的爆炸聲，使人感到特別的興奮。我們在師部裏看著周師長在指點地圖，發佈命令；在他的臉孔上，刻畫著滿不在乎的神情「盡量的浪費子彈，這是他們的特長！」他說，一邊嚼著餚餉。</p>

<h3>烏克蘭大詩人謝夫卿哥的生平（上）</h3>
<p>— 赤手</p>
<p>屠格涅夫在他底傑作「羅亭」裏面，故意用一個老頑固的腳色謾駡了一次小　俄羅斯的文學，那正是代表著舊俄時代的一般意見。但是實在那種受了長期壓迫的「落後」民族，卻也產生了不少的偉大作家。像佔領着俄國文學史上最重要的一頁的戈果理，其實便正是一位烏克蘭人。然而作品不曾傳佈開來，簡直為一般人所不知道的作家，而其實在他們民族中時重要的作家的，還多得很。現在我想來介紹的是在文學史上雖然偶爾可以看見一下名字卻從來很少有人詳細敘述他底生平的一位人物。</p>
<p>這一位人物便是烏克蘭大詩人謝夫卿哥（Tarass　Ohevtchenko）　。</p>
<p>一八一四年二月二十五日，這位詩人出生在靠近尼爾布爾（Dniepre）的一個村子裏面。他底父母都是農奴，而且在他八歲到時候便都死去。他最初進的學校是一個教會的私塾，在那兒他受盡了虐待和苦役。但他喜歡讀，寫，終於使那位酒鬼的先生也吃驚了起來。他底酒鬼的先生死後，他便到鄰村去在一位畫家底保護之下生活。他很想學畫，但那位畫家把他底手拿起來看了一下，搖了一搖頭便算完事了。終於他又忍不住那位畫家底虐待，遂逃回了他底本村，結果是去牧牛。</p>
<p>然而命運卻把他向另一方面拉走了。給他作工的主人是一位波蘭貴族，竟「看中」了他，叫他當他底隨身聽差。這一來，他竟有了機會到華沙，到維爾諾，到聖彼得堡等大都會去觀光。他底主人倒也還看出了他在繪畫方面的才能。在華沙，他使他到當時出名的畫家藍比（Lempi）底手下去學習；在彼得堡，他又把他送到一位呌作契利亞夫（Ohiriaev）的裝飾畫家底門下。他非常努力，無晝無夜地工作着。因為到公園中去寫生，被一位烏克蘭畫家索卿哥（Sonehenko）注意到了，即刻，他便得了一位新的朋友。而就是這位新的朋友，纔把他引到了大畫家的留魯夫（Brulov）底面前。-他底命運有轉機了，布留魯夫切實地認識了他底天才，決心呌他到美術學院去研究。但他是農奴，照例卻又沒有進學院的資格的。好在他底新朋友熱心得很，於是便會同名詩人邱哥夫斯基（Joukovski）向他底貴族主人去說情，并商量贖他的身價。邱哥夫斯基畫了一張肖像，以高價出賣。邱哥夫斯基是當著皇帝底家庭教師的，他底肖像果真就被皇族買去。於是二千五百盧布到手了，謝夫卿哥自由了。</p>
<p>進了美術學院，不久便以大畫家的風姿驚倒了他底同輩。但他不以他筆下的造型藝術為滿足，卻又寫起了詩歌。他所以要寫詩歌，據他日記上所說，是為了他底祖國烏克蘭的緣故。他要把烏克蘭語言煆煉成有音節的韻文，還要使民眾可以歌唱。他說：「我知道繪畫史我底職業，是我未來生存的泉源，但當我在不朽的布留魯夫底指導下，研究着藝術的奧秘的時候，我卻傾慕着詩歌，——那沒有使我賺一個銅板，而且還奪去了我底自由的詩歌！」因為他底詩歌保護了烏克蘭，同時也便冒犯了沙皇，後來他卻竟因為這個變成了流罪的人。</p>
<p>時間是一八四五年，他在美術學院修完了學院，便回到烏克蘭來，基輔（烏克蘭首都）大學已經決定聘他作木炭畫科的教授了，可是不料突然發生了不幸的事變。</p>
<p>當時基輔聚集着一羣優秀的人物，著名都有大歷史家哥斯朵馬羅夫（Kostomarov）　，歷史家并文學家庫里舒拉克（Hulak），——他們都是當時烏克蘭青年的領袖，在　那兒組織着一種集團，名目是「『聖』『文』（Oyrille）　『論』會」宗旨是要烏克蘭從沙皇底統治下解放出來，走向自治國的前途。</p>
<h3>「開放門户」</h3>
<p>— 子星</p>
<h3>鹹肉湯燒豆腐</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>有一次，我同幾個朋友談論到創作方法的問題。我們認為上海的文藝太消沉了，看不見多少有血氣的作品；原因很多，主要的卻由於上海的環境太惡劣。外界的壓力太兇，文藝工作者失卻自由，雖有熱烈興奮的話要說，爲了顧全文藝刊物甚至人生命的安全，只得中途勒住不說，結果空虛感歎的作品就漸漸多了起來，上海的文藝像走上了消沉的路。</p>
<p>於是我們想建議一個創作方法，來適應上海的環境，一方面卻不會抹殺文學上名族第一的本義。我們想了一下，一個朋友說了：</p>
<p>「我們來用鹹肉湯燒豆腐的方法。」</p>
<p>我覺得突兀，問這位朋友這個創作方法到底是怎樣的一種方法。他回到：</p>
<p>「我們在吃飯的時候不是常吃這一種經濟的湯嗎？味道很好，可是吃的時候要當心。堂倌把那鹹肉豆腐湯端上來，如果心急的人拿起調羹來盛了往嘴裏一送，定會呌他湯碎舌頭，喉嚨痛得大呌。原來那碗湯雖是死洋洋的，不冒出一股熱氣，但是那熱氣躲在油的下面，不露聲色，一點沒有消失。——你懂了嗎？我不說了，讓你寫文章吧。」</p>
<p>其實，我這篇文章雖然是寫了，但發揮起來困難，他的譬喻說得明明白白，再加油加醋，反而沒趣。不過我想不妨再引說幾句。</p>
<p>第一，我覺得這個鹹肉湯燒豆腐是一個好的創作方法，在上海當然更好，在內地也可偶而一用。內地有充分的自由空氣，激勵指摘都能說個痛快，效力也打，如果千篇一律，預防被人厭惡，鹹肉湯燒豆腐是一個好的調劑品，譬如像「華威先生」就是有點類乎此，而且很受歡迎。至於上海，這個地方便應遍地發展開來：一方面與環境不致發生表面化的衝突，另方面文藝的潛在力量保存下來，最後，像物理學上所說的一樣，由靜能化為動能。</p>
<p>第二，鹹肉湯燒豆腐是一種不容易成功的創作方法。最要緊的是內容的選擇。近來看到若干作品，往往因一樣東西（極平常的東西，像海水，月光，愛人的紀念品，故鄉的產物等等），就寫了一篇東西，說什麽限制我孤獨，我看見了想起故鄉的淪陷，啊呀噯呀，一篇完成。看來像與這豆腐湯沒有什麽區別，但細細一查，這些豆腐卻真的變成了豆腐，沒有骨沒有血，空空一塊。這是廢物，是化裝過的骷髏。所以，豆腐只是一個譬喻，實際上要變成一塊有骨有血有肉的生命體才對。形式上，也不可披着太華麗的散文的衣裳，我們只要經濟簡單的鹹肉湯，不要什麽雞汁魚翅湯，唯有鹹肉湯才是大眾的食品，而我們的文學是獻給大眾的。形式過於典雅，把內在的熱氣整個消滅；讀者會被外表迷住，不往裏面深處導求的。</p>
<p>第三，鹹肉湯燒豆腐原來是一種外乾中強實而不華的方法，外面看看很冷很平淡很溫和，裏面很熱很特出很刺激，好上口難脫手，笑面虎，魚藏劍，文學的作用盡了。握住道創作方法的靈鬼是象徵主義（積極的），我有機會可以來談談。這裏我希望上海的鹹肉湯燒豆腐似的文學會一碗一碗盛出來，給我尋精神食糧的人飽餐一下。</p>

<h3>書財部馬電限制提款辦法後</h3>
<p>— 詠華</p>
<p>八一三後，財政部頒布非常時期安定金融辦法，及其補充辦法，施行區域原不限於上海；即就上海一地而言，在該辦法實施之始，人亦安之若素。彼時所謂匯劃票據與法幣同為不涉外匯之一般交易上籌碼，法價無殊所不同者，慬日常生活所需之零星支出，不便以匯劃轉帳仍不得不藉法幣為交的確之媒價而已。其以匯劃票據貼現之事從不能謂其必無，或與法幣之清償效力故為區別，而低其價值，真可逕以擾亂金融　之。此因彼時圖發國難慣財者，不若今日之多，而在當時之情況下對於財部所頒之安全金融辦法，亦尚公認其有法的效力，而英敢或有異詞；乃能收宏效於一時。不圖引一隅地，自形成孤島而後，轉使資金疇形集中，運用乏術，向之興奮的人心，又漸趨冷落，於是有所謂外匯黑市者崛然興起，眉高眼低　匯劑易法幣之需要，繼漲增高，經濟上之自然趨勢與其原因，非　所欲深論。獨就法律方面觀察，前之安定金融辦法，能行於內地歷久而無礙，何獨於上海竟以漸失效用，而必　財部新近之馬電，再度限制以為補救；是不得不歸咎於銀錢業聯准會之公訂匯劃行市，與法院之裁判不認匯劃票據有清償效力，有以敢之。</p>
<p>銀錢業聯準會於往時劃匯貼現率之黑市高達七八十元時，受中中交三行之委託，出而拒負平準之責，固不能謂動機非善。然依財部原定辦法，察其主要目的，既在限制外匯之任意套取，而外匯之正當需要者，又始經繼續供給，則因國家拒絕供給外匯，而轉以謀諸黑匯市場者，皆不得謂為正當。聯準會易同業匯劃而為可向黑市套心灰意冷外匯之法幣，為公定水準。於是安定金融之效力全失，而拒收匯劃者持之有故。</p>
<p>司法上之裁判，應遵守法令，而為適當之解釋以運用之；所謂法令，應包括經過立法程序之法典及訓政時期約法第七十六條所稱之命令，八一三後財部所發布之安定金融辦法，不可謂非合於訓政時期約法第七下六條所稱之命令，法院固不得拒絕援用，其在援用上之適當解釋，尤應探求該　辦法整個之睦意所在，加以闡明，而不應斷章取議，從文字上為膚淺之認識。曾闖經租洋商，因拒以匯劃付房租而涉訟者，所得判決，　以匯劃限於同棠間使用為理由，而認付租須用法幣。殊不知部訂辦法，匯劃限於同業雲者，乃指其較解經同業轉帳，而不行逞以兌取法幣而言；非調其不能視作　碼，週轉於銀錢同業以外之人，或此籌碼之法價應較法幣有所減損也。彼洋商牟利而來，於我金融之安定，國策之維繫，痛癢無關，其不樂於收受匯劃，而以訴之方式僥倖試求，不足深貴。司裁判者，未能探求法令之真意以正其誤，而　斷章取義，否認匯劃票據有與法幣相同之汪償力，是其推波助瀾，授洋商之拒用者，以振振之辭；而予圖發國難橫財者，以絕大之助力，積久釀成今之局面，不可謂非空前之一大遺憾。</p>
<p>往事已矣，財部馬電限制提取存款之新辦法，又告施行；共區域以上海一市為限，其辦法不影響於內地之收解，而每週支取法幣數逾五百元者，仍限以匯劃支付，專供同業帳之用，共有移存於內地者，不受限制。此種措施，惟在維持本市之金融，不穀使圖發國難橫財者有以大量法幣套取外幣之機會，故於五百元以上之钜數收付，悉以匯劃轉帳行之，其非歧視　匯劃，否認共有清償效力，或抑低其法價，意義鮮明。如再執前此裁判上之謬誤風解，謂僅限於同業使用，而致疑共有與法幣相同之清償效力，則多數之存戶本非所謂銀錢同業，根本上即不應許銀錢　對其存戶以付與匯劃票據而代清償。謂存戶收自銀錢業付與之匯劃，不能付與銀錢業以外之人，清償共其所負之債務；理論荒誕，無逾乎是。苟充其說，則一切交易，皆須法幣週轉，法幣之需要益增，匯劃之用途益狹，喪心病狂之圖發國難財者，美其名曰平準調劑，共活躍亦必更甚於前馬電之限制，將不幸而徒以損已利人。何以防其弊，而謀發揮馬電限制之效能，是所望於法院與銀錢業聯準會及其他方面岐視匯劃之意態轉變。</p>
<p>研究與批評</p>
<h3>民法第一千零五十二條第四款之商權</h3>
<p>— 周大澐</p>
<p>我國民法新屬編第一千零五十二條第一項第四款規定雲。一妻對於夫之直系　親屬為虐待。或受夫之直系　親屬之虐待。致不堪為共同生活者。」此款亦係法定離婚原因之一。共適用場合有一。</p>
<p>（一）妻對於夫之直系等親屬為虐待者。夫得請求與妻離婚。</p>
<p>（二）妻受夫之直系等親屬之虐待者。妻得請求與夫離婚。此本毫無　義。無待　述。但細按該　款之義。皆徒妻之立場而為規定。對二夫之一方。初未論及。假定有下列兩種情形發生。勢將無從依據。</p>
<p>（一）夫對於妻之直系尊親屬為虐待者。（妻是否亦得依據該　款規定請求與夫離婚）</p>
<p>（二）夫受妻之直系親屬之虐待者。（夫是否亦得依據該款規定、請求與妻離婚。）</p>
<p>以上兩種情形。應如何解決。至　研究。若從　推解響。當然可以構成離婚原因。倘不予類推解　。則決非離婚原因。其間出入甚钜。大費推敲。或曰妻出嫁與夫為室。以夫　住所為住所。與夫之直系　親屬自有共同生活之可能。我國歷年來家庭。火都如此。至妻之直系等親屬則絕少與夫共同生活者。因而民法第四款。不予　定。殊不知通常婚媾。妻本以夫之住所為住所。至若贅婚。則一反共道而行之。夫以妻之住所為住所也。（見民法親屬編第一千零零二條後段規定。）何竟側電一面。可見該款規定。似欠週到。適用時不無　礙。擲意下次修正民法。該款應易為。「配偶之一方對於他方之直系等親屬為虐待。或受他方直系等親屬之虐待致不堪為其同生活者。」則較為　通。未識常世法家以為如何。</p>
<p>編者按民法第一〇五二條第一項規定「夫妻之一方以他方有基列情形之一者為限得向法院請求離婚」則其第二項各款情形自為夫妻雙方相互的而非偏面的在適用　上尚不致發生如　君所述之困難惟該條第二項第四款法　偏重妻方立言自有未善今周君擬修而正之洵屬至當</p>
<h3>民事訴訟法中當事人得為之聲請及其裁定（四讀每八期）</h3>
<p>— 沈天保</p>
<p>以上為我國現行民事訴訟法中明文規定當事人得為之聲請，然非學好事人得為之聲請全謂限於此，苟在法律範圍許可以內，發見有應行聲主必要者，仍可隨時聲請必要者，仍可隨時聲請，俾獲迅得適當判決目的。至法院方面接收當事人聲請後，即根據為一准許與束之裁定，裁定與判決不同之點，即前者屬於程序上所生之糾紛，後者屬於實體上所生之糾紛，前者不必經言詞辯論，後者須經言詞辯論，前者不服得提起抗告，後者不服可直起上訴是已。依我現行民事訴訟法規定，除駁回聲明或就有爭執之聲明所裁定須附理由外，餘則不附理由，祇須說明內容，能使當事人明瞭即可。凡宣示之裁定不必送達，記明卷宗內即可，依民事訴訟法第二百三十條規定，凡除本法應用判決者外以裁定行之，故應用裁定機會殊為擴汎，上列所舉之聲請，均可用裁定准駁之。此外法院認為應以職權處分某種行為，亦可以裁定行之。茲為醒目直見，特將裁定按其性質，分類於下：</p>

<p>裁判輯要</p>
<p>最高法院上海特區分庭</p>
<p>取捨證據，認定事實，屬於事實審法院之職權，苟其審認於法無遠，自非當事人所可空言加以指摘，（民國二十八年度　上字第五四號）</p>
<p>按給付價金，係屬金錢債務，根本上不生履行不能之問題，（二十八年度　上字第六五號）</p>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>鄙人於民國二十四年春，向甲租得　西矮平房一間，言明按月法幣七元正，迄八一三　戰爆發，雖　難他處，惟每月照常付租，絕未間斷，不料最近甲擬將該屋另租他人，揚言每月可得房租十五元，並一次繳付押租三百元。如鄙人欲繼續居住此屋，非按此款付租不可，否則逼令一月後遷移，惟鄙人戰後經濟拮據，若稍加房租二三元，尚能負擔，請問（一）在法律上甲是否有權逼令房客搬家而將該屋另租於他人？（二）鄙人若無餘屋可找，仍得略加房租或不加房租繼續居住否？（三）若甲施用強硬手段鄙人應用何種方法對付之？（姚承翔）</p>
<p>（一）否（二）加租續住屬於調解合意，非法律問題（三）可視其情形向捕房或法院依法聲訴（同）</p>
<p>今有某甲於二年前，向乙（即二房東）租得店堂一間，當時未訂書面契約，甲亦未加任何裝修，現乙欲收回自己設肆營業，於去年底曾口頭通知甲，限於本年三月底出屋，甲亦應允，　知到期，甲忽藉　無法　　，拒絕遷讓，茲有下列數問，　請示知　無　契約之承租人，甲不欠房租，乙能否將店堂收回自用？　乙於三個月前，口頭通知限期遷移，甲能否藉　拒絕　甲如不肯遷移，乙將否用褂號信通知甲，寬限一二個月？到期，甲再抗不遷移，乙可否向法院聲請判令出　？（夏世根）</p>
<p>（一）此種不定期租賃關係，如能證明確係收回自用，（並非意圖加租，託詞以回自用等情），自可主張終止契約。（二）雖於三個月前通知，並經承租人應允。但如果　　困難，承租人尚可根據民法第三百十八條第二項規定，主張緩期遷讓（三）乙原可用掛號信通知甲，限以相當期間遷讓，如再不遷讓，乙可訴請法院判令出屋。惟究竟有無理由，仍應參照上開一二兩點說明。（葉輝）</p>
<p>一二八後一載，甲向乙（二房東）租得一統樓，又三年，乙因回鄉穀將房屋頂與甲，甲不願租頂，乙乃轉讓給丙，時甲欲搬，丙乃竭力挽留之，並減去甲房租一元，甲為面情計，未搬「八一三」滬戰以來，居民突增，丙欲趁機佔利，催甲搬未果，乃加三元房租，前五個月，丙乃假　上（電費加價事）又向甲加一元，最近大房東有信囑二房東房租一律加一成，丙乃趁機向甲要加租十元，甲今失業在家，經濟國弱，僅允照大房東加租例加一成，丙乃囑甲搬遷</p>
<p>茲敬問：</p>
<p>（一）甲能否與丙交涉？</p>
<p>（二）若訴之法院，甲理能否勝丙？</p>
<p>（三）甲因房屋租不到，可否不搬？</p>
<p>（四）訴訟費約若幹？由何方負擔？（陸漢球）</p>
<p>（一）甲既向丙分租房屋，有租賃關係，自應接洽。（二）訴之法院，勝敗須憑證據，無從預斷。（三）甲租不到房屋，係事實問題，不能作抗辯之理由。（四）訟費以兩期租金之總額為準（伊）</p>
<p>房租可否付　劃（英）</p>
<p>請參閱木年五月八日第二期本刊法律質疑欄。</p>
<p>甲在民國十二年，向乙借洋五百元；出立字據，乙曾迄今十餘年，未曾清償，乙曾延律師去　催索，未有結果。現甲景況頗寬裕，乙擬訴甲，對於債務時效十五年期限，是否抵觸？（陳飛鵬）</p>
<p>如不能證明甲曾因催告而承認，　其時效現已屆滿。（詠）</p>
<p>片言</p>
<h3>父的吃虧</h3>
<p>— （无用）</p>
<p>原始時代的人類，知有母而不知有父，似乎一件很奇怪的事。豈知現在的法律上，父母也很有不同之點。　子女從父姓，若從母姓，必須父是入贅的或是父母另行約定的。父必須問母經過結婚的，或是後來結婚的，倘使父沒有同母結婚，那必須經父認領，或是撫育。父欲認領，子女或其生母還可否認，所以要為人父，卻有許多周折。至於母對其子女的關係，用不著　許多手續。那末，天下可有無父之人，沒有無母之人，換句話說，母生了子女，總是她的子女，父生了子女，可以不是他的子女，遭倒是男女不平等的一個　例，天下做父的，多麼吃虧，多麼冤呢？</p>

<h3>美專西畫系畢業紀念展</h3>
<p>— 虞復</p>
<p>把三年成績請求評覽　以一項薄技救濟難胞</p>
<p>滯留在孤島上的藝術家，看去似乎對於救國的重任，漢不關心，然而不能否認的，就是近幾個月來，以救難為前提的展覽會，不斷的舉行着，這就是藝術界救國的事實。</p>
<p>我們還記得，今年的一月裏，上海美專師生曾經舉行過一次救難畫展，結果，以售得券資近二千元，悉數捐給難童敎養院為建築校舍之用。</p>
<p>上海美專，為全國最早創辦之美術學校，歷史悠久，人才輩出，因之，本學期畢業的新制第廿四屆西洋畫系同學舉辦的畢業紀念展，是値得注視的。</p>
<p>他們這次的展覽，由畢業同學九人共同主持，它有着兩個意義：</p>
<p>第一，這九位畢業生，進了美專，忽忽已過三年，在這三年之中，朝夕研習，已否達到預期水準？以及今後在進修上應該如何策劃？這許多問題，迷惘在每個同學的心頭。所以，他們把幾點油畫習作，陳列出來，請求藝術界先進暨師長親友評覽，藉作參證。</p>
<p>第二，抗戰以來，哀鴻遍地，即上海一隅，被難同胞，無慮千百，他們在不能直接參與救國工作的環境之下，只得把這一點繪畫的薄技，救濟難胞，以仲初志，而盡國民的天職。</p>
<p>藝術是一個有機體，應該具着新陳代謝的機能。他們在數年的硏究之下，儘量作着滋生新細胞淘汰舊細胞的活動，而建立着新的藝術。所以，這次出品，其數不過百幅，其題材不過是風景，靜物，人物，小者盈尺，大者亦不及方丈，然在作風上，絕無學院派之頽唐的情調，庸俗華浮的感覺，而每一件作品，確充滿了現代藝術强明的精神，新穎的趣味，獨特的個性與靑年活力之流露。</p>
<p>為充實展覽內容，增加購券興趣計，並請校長劉海粟先生，西畫敎授關良，陳士文，茹茄先生概捐油畫傑作若干幅一併加入展覽，同樣給購券者有抽取的機會。</p>
<p>他們還預備在會塲上，為來賓速寫肖像，由畢業同學在二十分鐘中同時寫生，任被寫者選取一幅，是非常有意趣的事。</p>
<p>現在，希望各界人士，盡力指導他們，贊助他們，非但是鼓勵了這班靑年人從事新藝術的決心，而且還可以救濟了千百的難胞。</p>
<p>（註：展覽會定七月四日至六日在大新公司四樓畫廳舉行。）</p>
<h3>女彈詞</h3>
<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>女彈詞人物誌（二）</p>
<p>「嘉慶年間，雲間女子朱素仙，常召太倉項金姊，彈唱諸家傳說，……後自作玉蓮環授項歌之。道光時人作有烟盒記傳奇，記當時有彈詞女子楊玉珍者，善唱玉蜻蜓彈詞，後與秀才張姓者有私，用烟盒定情，以至涉訟遺戍，事多質實，淸人筆記多記其事，蓋實事也。又稱其色藝雙絕，為當時女彈詞之最著者。」</p>
<p>是可見一直到道光年間，女彈詞還是個人獨立，隨地彈唱，沒有固定的塲所。及至咸豐，上海日趨繁華，始漸被重視。據「淸稗類鈔」所云當時就有「名陸秀卿者，吳人也。避亂至滬。貌需絕色，藝為絕技，人爭招致之。一曲八金，姗姗來遲，飄飄去速，名重一時。」至彈唱之有固定書塲，則約始於王弢之所謂「城內土地堂」。到同治年間，纔有「書寓」。王弢「淞濱瑣話」（一八九三）卷十二「滬上詞塲竹枝詞」，曾說明書寓初期之人物：</p>
<p>滬上書寓之開創，自朱素蘭，久之而此風乃大著·同治初年，最為盛行，素蘭年五十許，易姓沈，猶時作筵間承應。繼素蘭而起者，為周瑞仙，嚴麗貞。瑞仙以說「三笑姻緣」得名，然僅能說半部，麗貞則能全演·惜蘭摧玉折，遽赴夜台。</p>
<p>竹枝詞之二云：「三笑姻緣讓瑞仙，就中猶數麗貞賢·而今剩有周孃在，猶戀人間姹女錢」·之三云：一老輩開塲是素蘭，一時裙屐　驚看·酒　羞說留髡話，不易尋常易合歡」，蓋即為上述之三人而詠者。這三人是「瀛壖雜誌」所不曾著錄的。素蘭事跡，已無可考，僅當時「申報」上，載有贈詩數首，略足想見。湘甫紅鏖過客「膾朱素蘭詞史」云：</p>
<p>不御鉛華愛淡妝，臨風馥郁麝蘭香。花農月夕聆仙樂，座上何人不斷腸。</p>
<p>平生絕技是洋琴，冰雪聰明證　心。雅擅彈詞人第一，歌聲嫋嫋有餘童。</p>
<p>原詩凡八首·足資參證者，此一首而已。又有白下靑溪生，作「五詞史詞」，其第二首即詠朱素蘭：「豈甘柔蕩學垂楊，洗凈鉛華別有香。最好泥人聽不厭，珠喉銀甲冠詞事」，吳興紉秋居士則評素蘭為「不把雙眉鬥畫長」。此皆略足見朱紫蘭者。特當時同名者難免，而王弢又有「年五十許」之記，不知是否一人耳。然旣無可反證，祇得漫存之矣。此開創書寓之第一個女彈詞也。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　勸學務農儲材為國　留強汰弱選有種有場</p>
<p>當時朱愛人開了汽車，便到這個省立第十三蠶種製造場來。那地方倒也幽靜，是在一座山脚下，還縈迥着一帶淸溪。那座山喚作菉山，上面有一大片竹林，中藏一個古寺。裏面有－個和尙，帶着個香伙，在那裏靜修。這古寺也只有幾間屋子，現在雖屬於自由村，村人也一聽其自由自在。山下有好多處，都佈滿了桑田，製種場也就在那裏。從公路築一條橫路，直通到製種塲，是製種場出資修築的，收拾到很為淸潔。他們進去時，恰巧今天那位場長在家。原來那位場長姓葛，他也是蠶桑專家，年紀也有五十多了。葛場長見朱村長引導了幾位小姐來參觀，很為歡迎。他除朱村長外，愛羣倒也認識，愛人却是久聞大名，到今日方始得見。至於何家兩位小姐，經朱村長介紹說明以後，方　知道。他見了米村長，便說：「我本來要來拜訪村長，報吿一些事。還有與村長商量，請你老先生帮忙的事。凑巧你老先生來了，再好也沒有了。』朱村長因問：什麽事呢？』葛塲長笑道：『停刻兒慢慢的和村長說。現在幾位小姐不是來參觀敝場嗎？此刻不是在養蠶時期，也沒有什麽參觀的。鄙人可以引導了，約略的看一看。』那時便由葛場長引導了，他們先到養蠶的大廣間來。這養蠶的大廣問，全場有五大間，這屋子都是平房，專門為養蠶用的。上面都有通氣的窗，下面都舖地板，四邊都有鐵紗窗，雖微細的蠅蛔，也不能進來。屋子裏也都裝了熱汽管，因為蠶也是一種嬌貴的動物，受不得凉。倘然正在牠發育的當兒，忽然天氣冷起來，牠就要吃不消了。到了那時候，便要使室內和煦如春，生起水汀來了。大槪蠶室內，有一定的溫度，近來有專供　室用的寒暑表，都懸掛在那裏的。養蠶時候，大致有相當的氣候，不過春蠶之外，又有夏蠶秋蠶，這要若干的溫度，比較複雜。但這是他們專門家的事，不勞煩絮，還有人說笑話，說是：『在中國的漢朝，有個人最明白這裏面的溫度，便是那位做史記的太史公司馬遷，因為他不是下過蠶室的嗎？』這真呌人聽了，不禁失笑咧。（一五一）</p>
<h3>靑年會舉辦少年消夏會</h3>
<p>— （余香芝）</p>
<p>時間到了夏季，各個學校裏都相繼放暑假，而那些莘莘學子，有了這樣長的暑假時間，自然會需要消磨的處所和方法。而「孤島」現在正在畸形地發展着，靑年們偶一不愼慎，必被沉悶所迫而趨於歌台舞榭中去，及其他許多不正當的娛樂塲所，度着「夏天裏的春天」生活。所以，上海基督敎靑年會的少年部，就來舉辦一個消夏會。利用暑假提倡團體生活，藉以發展少年身心，培養四育精神。時間自七月一日起，至八月底止。每日中午開始下午六時止。這個會，在苦悶的「孤島」夏天，給予一般人的消夏的正當方法，不但裨益於個人，擴大點說，還有利於社會，可是，因為主辦的幹部是少年部，所以微求對象，就以少年為主，凡年齡自十歲至十六歲的少年，不拘性別都可報名參加。我們以年齡來推測，恐怕都是一些高小及初中程度的男女學生，使他們和她們能够避免那些不正當的玩意，這一層收穫，或許能超過敎育以上的。</p>
<p>該會所規定的事項及娛樂方式甚多：例如游戲部份有。。乒乓，棋奕，球類，及其他游戲；求知識部份有：各種日報，雜誌；交際部份有：交誼會，團體游戲；中西歌詠，合唱；演講還有兩部份，即科學與常識兩種，科學的演講，大約為發動機，無綫電，飛機，毒氣，常識的演講，大約為衛生！飲食，兩性，擇友，團體生活等等。</p>
<p>此外，還有參觀及比賽兩種，由該會與各大工廠，機關，或園林等處接洽，率領去參觀。比賽，就是以自己所練的游戲歌唱等和會外的團體作友誼賽，得勝者還有獎品。</p>
<p>並且該會係服務少年為職旨，對於參加者不收費用，惟額定祗有五百名，祗有捷足者先得了</p>
<h3>金淑娟女士畫扇</h3>
<p>靑年業餘美術作家書畫展作品之一</p>
<h3>夢裏情人</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>“The　Shonwarn　Angel”</p>
<p>一九一四年的世界大戰，美國是最後一個加入協約國陣綫，對德宜戰的。現在世界風雲又到了一九一四戰事爆發的前夜，而各方對於美國的態度，尤其深切關注。「夢裏情人」雖然是一支輕鬆的戀愛喜劇，但是從美國民衆對於加入反侵略陣綫的出征軍人的特殊優待和鼓勵，我們至少可以看出一點美國的態度來的。在看完了這齣充滿着風趣情調的「夢裏情人」之後，我們不能忽略導演者在這方面的努力。譬如比爾被狄茜的汽車撞倒了，警察看見比爾是出征軍人，馬上命令狄茜的汽車送他聯隊。一個為了世界和平而上前綫作戰的軍人，民衆們是應該予以特殊的敬意的。狄茜雖然已允許和沙姆結婚，但在比爾出征的前夜，她不願願創傷他的心靈，也母寗說給予他一種最有力量的鼓勵，她獲得了沙姆的諒解，而和比爾結婚了。導演者在處理這塲戲時候，他在狄茜痛苦交迫之下，及沙姆的諒解中，竭力避免造成相反的效果，好像祗是欺騙這位忠厚的老實人馬上離開紐約似的。而在接到比爾戰死的消息時，正是狄茜在夜總會表演的時候，以重覆的歌聲來代替當時凄凉的空氣，也正是表示戰死者的光榮，和光明的到來。</p>
<p>導漬者也並不因為充滿了笑料的緣故，而使全劇的進展鬆弛下來，如比爾兩次在狄茜的室中；比爾和狄茜兩次出遊。，甚至沙姆的前後吸捲烟，都成了强烈的對照，情感十分濃厚的。</p>
<p>狄茜和比爾結婚以後的一段戲，是取難處理的，因為已經是贅累的尾巴了，但是這超過了一切的高潮，導演者是獲得了優美的成就。</p>
<p>詹姆士史都華的比爾，他那一付忠厚天眞的舉動，和「苦樂鴛鴦」的律師帮辦同樣成功。瑪格蘭莎麗文是悲劇勝於喜劇。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Ambushed Between Beigang and Tongcheng</h3>
<p>Pingjiang: Over four hundred Japanese troops entrenched in Beigang, northwest of Tongcheng, were attacked by Nationalist guerrillas and have been guarding their fortifications for days, afraid to venture out. Subsequently, the Nationalist side discovered that the Japanese troops' supplies were about to run out, and dispatched a team to ambush them on the route between Beigang and Tongcheng. At dawn on the 27th, over two hundred Japanese troops came from Beigang, and the Nationalist forces waited for the Japanese troops to enter the ambush zone before completely encircling them and launching a counter-attack from all sides. Over a hundred Japanese corpses were left behind, and only about fifty survived the breakout. Countless war trophies were seized. On the morning of the 28th, the Japanese troops dispatched over three hundred more troops to Tongcheng to transport grain, and encountered a certain Nationalist unit at Saigong Bridge, west of Tongcheng. After a strong attack by Nationalist forces, the Japanese were defeated again, with over fifty Japanese soldiers killed and wounded.

<h3>U.S. to Stop Purchasing Foreign Silver; Opinions from Financial Circles</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Financial circles stated today that China is not overly concerned about the possibility of the United States ceasing to purchase foreign silver. Political circles declared, "We naturally welcome any market that purchases our country's silver." However, the actions of the U.S. Congress were anticipated, so preventative measures were taken. China does not have a large amount of silver stored abroad. Most of the silver is stored in the United States, with a small amount in the United Kingdom. "Our country has already converted most of its silver into foreign exchange, as it was anticipated that the price of silver would fall once purchases ceased." (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>UK Drafting Tough Demands to be Raised in Tokyo Negotiations; Urging Japanese to Lift Tianjin Blockade and Suppress Anti-British Movement in Various Regions</h3>
<p>(London) The British government is today drafting several extremely tough counter-demands to be presented to the Japanese side during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations to be held in Tokyo this week. These will include the following: (1) Reopen all ports in China and allow foreign merchants to trade and navigate freely; (2) Open Japanese-occupied areas, especially the Yangtze River basin, and allow foreign trade; (3) Immediately lift the blockade of Tianjin and guarantee that British citizens will not be subjected to the same 'intolerable' insults in the future; (4) Immediately suppress the anti-British movement in Japanese-occupied areas; (5) Immediately release British military officer Lieutenant Colonel Spear, who was detained by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou on May 26 and has not been released despite repeated British representations.

<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese negotiations on resolving the Tianjin dispute are scheduled to be held on the 4th. Japanese politicians and journalists have initiated the convening of mass rallies to lecture on Anglo-Japanese relations. Japanese newspapers are also extensively promoting the idea that Japan has achieved great victories in the past two years and that all its gains may be forfeited should the negotiations with UK go wrong. Therefore, the Japanese people must unite and struggle on the same political front to make Britain fear Japan. (2nd Haitong Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin incident will be held in Tokyo within days. Renowned reporter Gayda (considered the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini) recently commented on the matter in the Italian Daily, believing that the two sides may not be able to reach an agreement. He stated that Japan's goal is to cut off supplies to the Chinese army, which it must achieve. As for Britain, with the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union still inconclusive, it is feigning a desire to conclude an agreement with Japan in order to intimidate the Soviet Union. Based on this, Japan's attitude towards Britain is understandably one of suspicion. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Another Englishman Humiliated in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, a British resident of Tianjin named Anderson encountered an obstacle on Wilson Street and entered the Japanese Concession to see his mother. Anderson lived in the British Concession, while his mother lived in the Japanese Concession, and they had not seen each other for many days. At the obstacle, he presented his passport to a Chinese policeman, who then passed it to a Japanese officer. The officer ordered Anderson to remove his hat, saying, "I cannot speak to you while you are wearing a hat." Anderson immediately removed his hat. The Japanese officer asked if he could speak Chinese. Anderson replied that he could. The officer then ordered him to remove his glasses and strip off his clothes, leaving only his shirt and pants. Anderson obeyed carefully. The officer then said, "Do you think you have nothing to fear just because you are British?" and struck Anderson's face twice with his passport, throwing it on the ground among Anderson's clothes. Finally, he allowed Anderson to put on his clothes and pass through the obstacle. Anderson returned to the British Concession via another obstacle in the afternoon, without being disturbed. Anderson was born in Tianjin and is a young man currently working for the Tianjin and Beijing Times newspaper. After the British Consul-General in Tianjin warned British residents not to leave the Concession lightly unless there was a special reason, things remained quiet for several days until today's incident.

<h3>Importance of the Burma Road</h3>
<p>(Singapore) Song Zi'ang, younger brother of former Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen and director of the Southwest Transportation Company, which operates thousands of trucks on the Burma Road, passed through Singapore by plane en route to Rangoon and told reporters that the original purpose of the Burma Road was as a commercial road between China and Britain. All of China's products, such as tung oil, bristles, and leather, which were previously shipped down the Yangtze River for export, will now pass through the Burma Road. In addition to the sea route, the road has provided Britain with a new route for trade with China. Once the Yunnan-Burma Railway is built, Rangoon will become even more important, as products from all of southwestern China will pass through it. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Tension in Danzig and the Overall Situation</h3>
<p>Germany's scheme to seize the Free City of Danzig, in terms of political arrangements, is that German officials and the Danzig authorities have openly and unreservedly admitted to their collusion; in terms of military planning, German combat personnel and large quantities of light and heavy weapons are constantly pouring into Danzig, almost openly; overall, the recent developments have indeed reached the stage of revealing the final intentions. As a result, those concerned about world affairs are asking whether there will be war in the future.</p>
<p>No war means temporary peace. War, however, would affect almost all of humanity in space and future centuries in time, which is no small matter. As things stand now, there are indeed some reasons to say that there will be no war, but there are many problems blocking the way and hanging unresolved, and the mutual stimulation and turbulence cannot be prolonged; moreover, the arms race is intensifying without end, and no war is no solution either. If it is said that war is inevitable, then Hitler is full of hope that things will fall into place without war; Chamberlain hopes to prevent the outbreak of war with the determination to go to war; that is, neither side wants war. Therefore, it is impossible to answer whether there will be war or not today.</p>
<p>Moreover, the essence of the problem is not in the so-called war or no war. It lies in how each country can revise its attitude and restrain its desires in order to resolve disputes; it should also be based on establishing long-term peace and stability, and not spare some reasonable sacrifices; for example, the recent agreement between France and Turkey, which makes the situation in the clarified Mediterranean region more moderate and stable, can indeed be called a representative work of modern human civilization. Therefore, the current crux is where the path to peace lies. If this is not the plan, either the independence and freedom of other countries will be disregarded, and the pursuit of gain will be taken as pleasure; or they will aspire to an immeasurable future with excessive self-esteem, or they will take the historical fragments of the past as the standard, vying for hegemony and seeking the ultimate and unrivaled supremacy of vanity and material benefit without end; or they will seek to gain as much as possible where there is an opportunity and a gap to be exploited, or they will seek to keep as much as possible when the temporary environment is favorable to them, using all means possible to borrow from their own strength and even the strength of others, calculating every penny; all these, their consciousness fundamentally does not value peace, and if such friction does not lead to war, it is not that there is no way to avoid war, nor that there is a fork in the road between war and no war, but only a lucky avoidance of war. Tracing back to the international disputes since the Spanish Civil War, through the Munich Agreement; in between, there were changes such as those in Czechoslovakia, Austria, Memel, and Albania; nothing could not be fought, and each time there was a reason to start a war; although no war has been started so far, the tension is increasing, and the main problems in Europe remain unresolved. With the path to peace vague and distant, the question is not whether to fight, but only when to fight. If Danzig is indeed seized by Germany, it is a common trick for Germany; if this leads to a major war, it is not surprising in terms of the principle of the matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, in view of the evolution of the Danzig issue and the tension in Europe, and paying attention to the development of the Danzig issue in the coming weeks, as well as the actions of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the actual question that exists is how long the temporary peace can be maintained? Hitler's ambition is the driving force of war, and his private desire for a non-war solution is not enough to guarantee temporary peace; Chamberlain's determination to go to war is enough to delay the war, but his thought of war and his hope to avoid it will induce the reckless to advance. Although the result of the reckless advance may be that the League of Nations commissioners of the Free City of Danzig will not only do nothing but also express indifference, or that Poland will abandon Danzig in time without resistance, or that Britain and France will not fulfill their commitments due to any theoretical basis and factual reasons, there is still a one in a million chance that there will be no war; however, under the leadership of Hitler, Germany's national power is increasing day by day, and its desires are insatiable. Therefore, even if Danzig is settled without war, the European situation's no war is still only a matter of time. Moreover, silently observing the international situation, there are those who fear that the world will not be in chaos, who wish to stay out of it, reap the benefits, and engage in superficial compliance and secret incitement, there must be such people. In short, all international disputes need to be resolved, and the foundation of peace needs to be established, which cannot be achieved without the most active action. Without resolving disputes and establishing the foundation of peace, the scourge of war cannot be eliminated. The outbreak of war is only a matter of time, and the form of war will be an indiscriminate melee. The so-called active action is not appeasement of flattering the strong and suppressing the weak, not passive mutual assistance and response to war, but holding justice in one hand and a sword in the other, forcing the aggressor to submit!</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Announces Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Times - Statement from the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Ministry of Finance announced the following measures for prohibiting the import of goods during extraordinary times: (1) According to the eighteen groups and two hundred and thirty-four tariff headings of imported goods listed in the attached table, the Ministry of Finance shall order the Chief Inspector of Customs to instruct all customs offices to uniformly prohibit imports. (2) After the issuance of the aforementioned prohibition of import goods, the re-export of goods shall also be prohibited simultaneously. (3) If the prohibited imported goods are for regulating post-market prices, for special purposes, or for other legitimate reasons, and have been verified and requested by government agencies, the Ministry of Finance may examine the actual needs and issue special purchase and transport permits, and separate measures shall be established for issuing permits. (4) These measures shall also apply to prohibited imported goods that are sent by mail from overseas or re-exported from domestic ports. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently made a statement on the significance of announcing the measures for prohibiting the import of goods during extraordinary times, as follows:</p>
<p>"Maintaining a balance of international payments is essential in the economic policy of any country. During wartime, trade tends to be adverse, and the government should adopt various methods to maintain balance, so as not to affect the national economy and hinder the progress of the war. China has long suffered from a large trade deficit, and the defense products and industrial and transportation equipment needed during wartime still rely heavily on imports. If the adverse trend of international payments is not reversed, it will inevitably</p>
<p>affect the exchange rate</p>
<p>market and hinder the economy. In view of this, the Ministry drafted the "Outline of Measures for Promoting Production and Adjusting Trade" in September of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], established three adjustment committees for agricultural, industrial and mining trade, and allocated additional funds to establish war risk insurance, which are essential economic strategies during wartime. At the same time, it also drafted a management plan for prohibiting, limiting, and permitting imports and submitted it for approval. Due to various reasons, the import management plan was not approved for implementation. Later, when foreign exchange management was implemented in March of last year, an import management plan was proposed again, selecting certain types of luxury goods and non-essential luxury goods, planning to separately</p>
<p>prohibit and limit imports</p>
<p>Items needed for the war of resistance, reconstruction and daily use were approved for the government bank to sell foreign exchange at the legal price. However, due to external doubts and obstruction, it could not be put into practice. In the past year or so, the enemy and puppets have used our tax revenue and plundered our resources to exchange a large amount of legal currency for foreign exchange, which has caused unprecedented drastic changes in the foreign exchange market in recent years. Since the establishment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the participation of British banks in the stabilization work, which was originally a kind intention of British assistance and also a way to facilitate international trade, the stabilization work has been</p>
<p>difficult</p>
<p>During the War of Resistance, the people should practice thrift, reduce unnecessary consumption, and increase the purchasing power of essential goods, in line with the principle of military first and victory first. After careful discussion, it was agreed that prohibiting the import of some goods is a necessary measure during wartime and will surely be understood by Chinese and foreign people. That is, all items that are not essential for the War of Resistance, national construction, and daily life, or have partial needs but can be replaced by domestic products, or are mostly produced and imported from enemy countries and are easily counterfeited and sold, should be prohibited from import.</p>
<p>Prohibited goods</p>
<p>The Ministry drafted a prohibition plan according to the above standards. For example, foreign wine, foreign cigarettes, seafood, silk goods, cosmetics, ornaments, toys, musical instruments, some sugar products, prepared foods, canned fruits, vegetables, as well as luxury wool and cotton goods, wood, paper, bamboo and rattan products, earth and stone products, and liquid fuels that can be replaced, totaling two hundred and thirty-four tariff headings, are all on the prohibited list. The Ministry has telegraphed the Chief Inspector of Customs to telegraph to the customs offices to uniformly prohibit imports from the date of the order. After the above items are prohibited from import, according to the import amount in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], it is estimated that more than 230 million yuan can be saved, equivalent to 68 million US dollars and 13 million British pounds.</p>
<p>Huge amount of foreign exchange</p>
<p>This expenditure can be used to purchase materials necessary for the War of Resistance and national construction. In China, this is just a change in the use of foreign exchange. In other countries, it is just a conversion of imported goods. In essence, the statistics of its trade with China will not be greatly reduced, and it should be able to obtain the full understanding of friendly countries. The measures for prohibiting the import of goods during extraordinary times are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) According to the eighteen groups and two hundred and thirty-four tariff headings of imported goods listed in the attached table, all customs offices shall uniformly prohibit imports.</p>
<p>(2) After the aforementioned prohibition of import goods, the re-export of goods shall also be prohibited simultaneously.</p>
<p>(3) If the prohibited imported goods are for regulating post-market prices, for special purposes, or for other legitimate reasons, and have been verified and requested by government agencies, the Ministry of Finance may examine the actual needs and issue special purchase and transport permits, and separate measures shall be established for issuing permits.</p>
<p>(4) These measures shall also apply to prohibited imported goods that are sent by mail from overseas or re-exported from domestic ports. The detailed list of names and tariff headings of prohibited imported goods will be announced in the newspapers separately. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange for Export Goods and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently made a statement on the significance of announcing the "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange for Export Goods and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference," as follows: Regarding the significance and measures for prohibiting non-essential imported goods, a statement has already been issued separately. At the same time, the Ministry has always considered the issue of promoting export trade to be extremely important. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, it has formulated the "Outline of Measures for Promoting Production and Adjusting Trade," organized trade adjustment agencies, and promulgated various adjustment measures. In June of last year, it also promulgated</p>
<p>Maintaining production</p>
<p>Measures to promote exports, in addition to using methods such as exempting donations and taxes, providing war risk insurance, facilitating transportation, and financing funds to assist merchants in operating export trade, government trade agencies also purchase as much as possible in order to increase exports and revitalize production. However, in recent years, due to traffic difficulties, domestic products cannot be exported in large quantities, and the number of exports has decreased accordingly. Under such circumstances, merchants have increased costs and insufficient funds, and they inevitably doubt and fear operating exports.</p>
<p>Foreign firms</p>
<p>which have been operating exports in the country also hinder exports due to non-normal trade, which is not the intention of the Ministry to maintain the national economy. In addition, due to recent foreign exchange market changes, in order to assist the stabilization work and reduce its difficulties, the Ministry has drafted the "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange for Export Goods and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference." Except for tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals, which are related to barter debt repayment and material storage, the foreign exchange obtained from other export goods should be settled at the legal price and sold to the national bank. At the same time, the Central Bank will give an amount equivalent to the difference between the legal price and the bank's listed price. By doing so, most export goods can be</p>
<p>freely transported and sold</p>
<p>The huge amount of exchange rate obtained can be used to pay fees and still obtain the remainder. The government has solved all the difficulties of the merchants. The foreign exchange needed by the government can still be largely concentrated in maintaining the legal currency and stabilizing finance. It can also promote exports and increase production, which is a comprehensive consideration for the national economy and people's livelihood. The measures for settling foreign exchange for export goods and receiving the exchange rate difference are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) All export goods should be settled in foreign exchange. Except for tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals, which are related to barter debt repayment and material storage and should be purchased and sold by government trade agencies at preferential prices at any time based on production and sales conditions and international market prices, other goods, whether sold by government trade agencies or traded by commercial firms themselves, must sell the foreign exchange obtained to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications at the legal price. The legal currency to be obtained from the sale shall be paid by the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications at the designated inland location with the consent of the exchange settler.</p>
<p>(2) After the actual settlement of foreign exchange amount for the export goods settled at the legal price in the preceding paragraph, the exchange rate difference between the legal price and the bank's listed price may be received from the settling bank upon presentation of the settlement documents. The bank may charge the settling party the usual handling fee that the bank should obtain, but it shall not exceed three percent.</p>
<p>(3) The aforementioned difference shall be paid by the original settling bank at the designated inland location with the consent of the settling party. (2nd dispatch)</p>

<h3>US House of Representatives Passes New Neutrality Act - Hull Considers it Unsatisfactory - Arms Embargo Clause Must Be Removed - This is Greatly Related to Preventing War</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to reporters, saying that it is regrettable that the neutrality bill sponsored by the government has failed. Efforts should be continued to ensure that the arms embargo clause is not included in the new neutrality bill. "I previously sent letters to the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives on May 29 of this year, listing six points for the peace and neutrality plan. I firmly believe that it is sufficient for our country to maintain peace and not be dragged into the vortex of war. The legislative method containing the arms embargo clause or other similar clauses is more effective. Before submitting this plan, I repeatedly talked with the members of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives and members of various parties, and then sent it to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee for review. Initially, the international situation was such that even if this plan was not completely satisfactory, it should be accepted by a majority of members of Congress. Unexpectedly, it failed by a few votes. For the sake of maintaining the interests of peace and for the most valuable interests of our country's international relations, it is regrettable. In fact, my plan is not only the best way for our country to maintain peace after the outbreak of war, but the most important point is that it helps prevent the war, which is far better than the current neutrality law or other similar laws. It is even more a matter of course to be fully in line with the universally recognized international law. Therefore, I should continue to work hard to ensure that the recommendations I have put forward can be adopted by Congress," he said. (1st dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the resolution passed by the US House of Representatives the day before yesterday prohibiting the supply of arms to belligerent countries, the astonishment of French people can be seen in today's newspapers. Disappointment and worry are overflowing in words. All newspapers said that if war breaks out, President Roosevelt will probably be unable to do anything about supplying arms to Britain and France except to supply food and raw materials.

The difference between income and expenditure is $3,600,054,404 US dollars. Among the expenditures, the national defense expenditure of $1,074,601,640 US dollars is the largest. Compared with the fiscal year 1937-38, although the revenue has decreased due to the economic depression, the expenditure has greatly increased. In addition, the total amount of national debt has also increased from $37,164,740,315 US dollars to $40,439,532,411 US dollars. (1st dispatch from Havas)</p>

<p>(Washington) The application for a government subsidy of $3,800,000 US dollars submitted by Pan American Airlines to operate the North Atlantic mail route has been approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board today, but the subsidy has been reduced to $2,454,400 US dollars.

<h3>Although US President's Financial Power Has Expired - The US Dollar Remains Stable - The Tripartite Monetary Agreement Operates as Usual</h3>
<p>(Washington) The bill to extend the term of President Roosevelt's powers in the monetary and financial system failed to pass due to the delaying tactics of opposition senators. According to people in the Ministry of Finance, although the government cannot use the $2 billion US dollars of the exchange stabilization fund in the future, after the banks resume business after the three-day holiday this month, the Ministry of Finance can purchase gold at appropriate prices when necessary, and the Federal Reserve Bank can also buy and sell foreign exchange to maintain the stability of the US dollar. Therefore, although the president's financial power has expired, causing various difficulties, the tripartite monetary agreement between Britain, France and the United States can still operate as usual due to the cooperation of the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Reserve Bank. (1st dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's struggle to obtain monetary power came to a temporary standstill at the end of this week. It is still difficult to predict the outcome of this monetary struggle between the government and the opposition (including the Republican Party and the conservative Democratic Party). Even the vote on Wednesday may not be able to decide. The US President returned to his private residence in Hyde Park last night, planning to attack his "monetary enemies." US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also returned to his private residence to rest last night, which is not far from the President's private residence, so it is expected that he will discuss with the President how to deal with the enemy. According to the President's friends, the President was extremely dissatisfied with the two defeats in Congress this week, and continued to study countermeasures until late Friday night. The House of Representatives accepted the recommendation last night to restore the President's power to devalue silver dollars, and set the domestic silver price at 71.1 cents per ounce.

<h3>British Government Prevents Aggression Policy - All Parties in the Government and the Opposition Unanimously Firmly Support - Simon Says the Situation is Serious and Britain's Attitude is Absolutely Unhesitating - Eden Says the Future is Dangerous but Not Hopeless</h3>
<p>(London) The British government and the opposition unanimously advocate taking a firm stand to resist aggression. All parties in the parliament are prepared to support the government's policy of resisting aggression. All these can be seen in the speeches made by the government cabinet members and the leaders of the parties.</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon gave a speech in Sheffield yesterday, explaining the views of the British government, saying that the speech made by Foreign Secretary Halifax the day before yesterday not only represented the government and the people of the whole country, but also said what the rest of the world wanted to say. Although the content was very clear and firm, it was not provocative. Today, the position of the United Kingdom is very clear and leaves no room for doubt. In a nutshell, its purpose is to maintain peace. If world peace is destroyed and there is a need to rebuild the foundation, it is also determined to make the necessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>Sir Stafford Cripps, the leader of the extreme faction of the Labor Party, said in a speech in the Indian region, "We cannot tolerate anyone who attempts to control us, deprive us of our freedom, and interfere in our affairs. We must unite the whole country, unite all allied countries, and concentrate all our strength to implement self-defense."</p>
<p>Sir Archibald Sinclair, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, declared in Bedford City that there is no defeatism in Britain. The hearts of the people are extremely firm, the military strength is extremely strong, and its resources are extremely abundant, which must be understood by the aggressor countries. At this point, Prime Minister Chamberlain must resign, and Churchill and Eden should be allowed to enter the cabinet. Minister of Mines Lloyd George said in a speech in Birmingham, "Although Britain hates war, it will fight to the end for Britain's freedom and independence when necessary."</p>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Eden also gave a speech in Ealing, saying that if Britain's foreign policy can be understood by foreign countries, war can be avoided. The attitude of the British people is now very clear and has an unshakable determination. In the past, even if aggressive actions were not curbed, it is absolutely impossible in the future. The speech made by Foreign Secretary Halifax the day before yesterday has frankly explained the position of the British people, and his warning to all the powerful countries has been supported by the whole country. In a nutshell, the British people are determined and will not hesitate to face any threat and will no longer give in to force.</p>
<p>Sir Muirhead, chairman of the executive committee of the opposition Liberal Party, gave a detailed account of the current situation in Hyde Park, London, saying that if a new crisis occurs in the Free City of Danzig, no one will say that this matter has nothing to do with Britain. At that time, we will fight to defend freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>Conservative Party members held a meeting in Birmingham today and read out a letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying, "I will continue to work hard to maintain peace in Europe, and at the same time, I am determined to resist all attempts at aggression or control. You can trust that at this moment, if other countries attack, the strength of our country's defense line is unprecedented." The far-right member of the lower house, Amery, then delivered a speech, saying that at this point, making frank words is of no use. Only by taking various practical measures can Hitler believe that our country's words and deeds are consistent and will fulfill its commitments. Although peace is not hopeless, we should immediately mobilize the navy and air force, and send aircraft to France when necessary, the number of which should be equal to the number required for combat. If this can be done, Germany will be alerted to our country's serious attitude. (1st dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Greenwood, the acting leader of the Labor Party in the House of Commons, today expressed his views on the international situation to a Reuters reporter, saying that Britain is unwilling to go to war and will only fight to defend the principles on which its independence and freedom depend. Britain is determined to resist continued aggressive actions similar to those that have recently led to turmoil and fear in Europe. These actions destroy the dignity of the law and replace it with the power of the iron fist, which has endangered the foundation of civilization. Therefore, the willingness of peace or war is now entirely in the hands of potential aggressors. He hoped that the German people could grasp this fact and the disputes it contained. Greenwood reiterated that there is no struggle between the British and German people. The conflict now lies between the policy of aggression and the principle of free negotiations to resolve demands and disputes. (2nd dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon said in a speech in Sheffield today that the general political situation is now very serious. Britain's position is now undoubted. Foreign Secretary Halifax's remarks are not only the opinion of the British government but also the public opinion of the British people and most of the world outside the British Empire. His words are not provocative, but firm and clear, so that the world understands Britain's position. As far as he knows, the British people have never been so united on such a big issue. Anyone who wants to know Britain's purpose can now understand it more clearly than before. (1st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Former Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in Ealing tonight that the recent prospects are serious and dangerous, but not hopeless. If Britain's purpose is firm and understood by foreigners, war will not occur. Today, the attitude of the British people is neither fanatical and warlike nor willing to fail, but calm, firm and unshakable. The era of endless aggression has now ended. Foreign Secretary Halifax has explained the position of the British people in clear words. The British people support and welcome this warning. Once Britain has spoken, it will never go back. The British people love peace very much, but they have learned the lessons of brutal facts. The methods of force that have been used before are now showing signs of re-enactment. The only way for countries that wish to enjoy peace is to show their willingness to sacrifice what they most want to maintain in order to enjoy peace. The British people are now determined not to hesitate in the face of threats and not to give in to violence. (1st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Liberal Party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair said at a Liberal Party rally near Bedford today that if anyone fights against Britain or against a country whose independence Britain guarantees, they will see that there is no one in Britain who is afraid of war. Britain's military equipment is formidable, and Britain's strength is infinite. The British people would rather resist than submit to violence. Munich has made peace difficult to maintain, so cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union is especially necessary. However, if Chamberlain does not step down one day, the firmness of Britain's purpose will never be believed by foreign countries. Therefore, he advocated reorganizing the government and recruiting Churchill and Eden into the cabinet. (1st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Minister of Munitions Burgin said yesterday at the celebration meeting of the establishment of the unified government in Rothesay, Scotland, that "In 1939, a small part of the world's population of 200 million people wanted to intimidate and blackmail the entire civilized world, and the whole world has rejected this attitude. Britain and its empire are now joining hands with friends who speak the same language on the other side of the Atlantic, and represent a very large part of public opinion. Except for the small and weak countries that only want not to be involved in any whirlpool, the entire British Empire and the United States have been combined. We have now reorganized our military equipment, but not entirely for our own defense, but because the weak countries have discovered that the regimes they hate often use sweet words to achieve their ambitions of aggression and annexation. Burgin continued, "Anyone who plans to attack Britain is tantamount to signing his death certificate. Some people mistakenly believe that the peace group advocated by Britain is a encirclement. He now especially explains to the German men and women that Britain is not their enemy, but it can never listen to others' orders. We have the world's largest navy, the expansion of the air force has exceeded people's imagination, and we have a well-trained and mechanized army with the most modern weapons. In addition, there is a great national spirit that will never show weakness and be intimidated. Although we are determined to seek peace, we also have limited concessions to any external interference." (2nd dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>French Wine Festival - President Lebrun Explains Determination - If the World Sees War Again, France Will Fight Resolutely - We Will Also Cooperate Sincerely with Those Who Maintain Peace</h3>
<p>(Montpellier, France) Today is the "National Wine" festival. The local winemakers specially set up a grand banquet to entertain President Lebrun. Interior Minister Sarraut delivered a speech on the spot, saying that the independence of free nations in various provinces has been threatened. "French factories are working day and night to strengthen national defense. We must now have a firm national soul and an unshakable will to resolutely hold high the torch of freedom and continue to carry forward its destiny." President Lebrun then delivered a speech, the words of which roughly said, "If the world is hit by misfortune again and war is seen again, France will once again rise up to fight for freedom, justice and the rule of law, which is no different from what it did in 1914. When those who maintain civilization decide the country with destroyers, France has already made up its mind where to go. In essence, France will provide assistance to those who can cooperate internationally to maintain the rule of law, and will resist those who want to promote military politics and destroy the independence of small countries. We very much hope that all disputes between nations can be resolved peacefully. Peace is beneficial to mankind and is trusted by us, but for the sake of ensuring national security and fulfilling international commitments, sacrifices are necessary. At this point, if the nations of the world can be open and honest and hold a referendum, I know that the majority will agree with the democratic countries of Western Europe without a doubt. Premier Daladier once encouraged the people to "unite and wait in readiness." I would like to encourage you to share it. (2nd dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>Germany Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Foreign newspapers are filled with alarming rhetoric regarding the future of Danzig, but local people here are observing it with indifference and remain unmoved. There are rumors that Hitler will visit Danzig in early or late July and declare the annexation of the Free City of Danzig. Political circles here consider this unlikely. Furthermore, there are malicious rumors that many German soldiers have already infiltrated Danzig and will take some action on Saturday night or Sunday to make Poland feel that it cannot stand idly by, but also make intervention inconvenient. If there is any intervention, Poland will be placed in the position of an aggressor, and there will be no justification for its actions. In this way, Germany can hope that the British and French governments will not honor their promises to help Poland, etc. All these are unfounded rumors and not credible. The German General Newspaper solemnly declared last night that German political figures and the residents of Danzig are unconcerned about the spreading rumors. (Haitong Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>Poland Will Explain Its Position on Danzig</h3>
<p>Warsaw – Polish Foreign Minister Beck received Chodacki, the Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, this afternoon. Chodacki came here from Danzig to report to the government on the state of military preparedness of the Danzig National Socialist Party. It is expected that they discussed sending a note to the Danzig Senate, requesting an explanation regarding the military deployments in the demilitarized zone. Well-informed sources do not believe that these deployments are a prelude to a sudden event, as British Foreign Secretary Halifax has already issued a warning, and Germany may not be willing to be the first to resort to arms. According to public opinion, Germany is currently employing a strategy of pinpricks, none of which can be considered serious enough to endanger Polish independence, but its aim is to gradually exclude Poland from the Free City and then present a fait accompli to Europe without resorting to war. However, Polish officials have repeatedly stated that Poland will never allow its rights in Danzig to be undermined. (Reuters Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Well-informed sources here recently declared that after the Free City of Danzig council took various military measures, a novel situation has been created. The Polish government is closely monitoring its development and will formally state its position at an appropriate time, which will not be far off. Political figures also stated that the measures taken by the Danzig City Council are illegal actions with provocative nature. The semi-official Iskra News Agency issued a message stating that Germany's intention is to force Poland to intervene, so that the world sees Poland as an aggressor. "This attempt will definitely fail. It must be known that if the current status of our country's territory on the Baltic Sea coast is to be changed in practice, whether in the Free City of Danzig or elsewhere, regardless of the method used, our country will immediately respond without reservation." The Times reported, "We are ready and believe that if Germany forces our country to fight, the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 will be reenacted today." (Havas Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>The King of England Reviews Serving Youth</h3>
<p>(London) The King of England, accompanied by Queen Mary, reviewed 20,000 men and women in Hyde Park today, representing the two million people in the National Service Volunteer Corps. They marched in formation for over an hour before finishing. Among them were 200 mechanized vehicles. In the morning, the King and Queen went to Westminster Abbey to offer prayers of gratitude for their safe return from Canada, Newfoundland, and the United States. The Cabinet was represented by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Inskip, and others. At the beginning of the ceremony, the national anthem was played, and the Archbishop recited prayers for the King and the royal family, followed by a special prayer for peace.

<h3>Britain Organizes Women's Service Team</h3>
<p>(London) According to today's announcement, Britain is now organizing a women's service team called the Women's Auxiliary Air Force to serve the Air Force in wartime. Female officers will be trained, and women will be recruited to work as cooks and drivers during wartime. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Japan Takes Leave to Return Home</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Smetanin, declared that his departure to return home this time is of a temporary nature, and rumors that he was recalled by the Soviet government are completely untrue. Smetanin made the above clarification yesterday when he spoke with the Director of the European and West Asian Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is reported that Smetanin is scheduled to depart from Tokyo on July 5th. (Haitong Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Anglo-French Diplomatic Activities Deny Warning Germany French Foreign Minister Meets German Ambassador, Both Sides Explain Attitudes Toward Poland</h3>
<p>(Paris) German Ambassador to France, Welczek, has just returned to his post here from Berlin and met with Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday afternoon (the first time in six weeks), informing him of his government's views on the European situation. Foreign Minister Bonnet also explained to him the attitude that France would take if Germany were to invade the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor. As for rumors that the British and French governments have issued a warning to Germany, stating that if Germany annexes the city of Danzig, Britain and France will not tolerate it, responsible figures here have denied this. They said that it is true that the British and French governments have been intensifying the exchange of views and have summoned their ambassadors to Poland back to their countries to report on their duties, but they have never made any representations to the German government, nor have they issued any warnings. The reason is that, as of now, Germany has not overtly interfered in the Danzig situation. The current tense situation is occurring within the city of Danzig. In this regard, if the Free City authorities do intend to declare annexation to Germany, then the counterparts of negotiations for the British and French governments will be the Free City authorities, not the German government. This is clear. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Sir Phipps today to discuss the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and the general international situation. According to information received here, these negotiations are progressing smoothly, and the views of both sides are significantly closer than before. The date of completion should not be far off.

<p>(London) The British Mediterranean Fleet will hold exercises in the Eastern Mediterranean within a short period of time. Several warships of various sizes and the 22,500-ton aircraft carrier "Glorious" are scheduled to sail to Greek territorial waters to concentrate and participate in the exercises. (Havas Telegram, 1st)</p>

<h3>Germany's Internal and External Arrangements for Danzig Proceed Simultaneously Old Ships Carry Guns and Ammunition East Prussia Repairs Bridges and Roads</h3>
<p>Danzig - Although it has not been confirmed that German leader Hitler will visit Danzig at the end of July to personally receive the honorary citizenship of Danzig, which the city will present to him on his birthday, all preparations are now underway. The National Socialist Party's publication, the Danziger Post, criticized the British-French relationship in the Danzig situation, stating that Danzig must be returned to Germany, and when this will be realized will be decided by Hitler. The current arrangements seem to have presented Poland with the difficult problem of whether to preemptively strike or wait until the National Socialist Party completes its arrangements before acting. Although the National Socialist Party denies conducting military plans, information to the contrary is often leaked. National Socialist Party shipyards have been closed for two nights, and even night watchmen are not allowed to enter. It is reported that war materials are being landed there and transported away by trucks. German soldiers are often seen driving trucks openly through the city. A hotel opposite the railway station has been requisitioned as a military dormitory. Horses were requisitioned at the beginning of last week, and now various automobiles are being investigated. The owners of the cars have received notices to be ready for immediate requisition. The Elbing Road in East Prussia is strategically important and is now closed to private traffic for repairs. It is reported that bridge-building materials have been prepared to create a pontoon bridge at Los Buden within an hour to cross the Vistula River. Although rumors of currency devaluation have not been confirmed, they have not been denied, causing increasing anxiety in the business community. However, both the Poles and the National Socialist Party are now carefully avoiding open provocative incidents. The National Socialist Party is not yet prepared to take decisive action, and Poland is currently standing still. Yesterday, British newspapers were confiscated, as they wanted to keep the people from knowing the truth about foreign affairs. However, people from all walks of life now know that Germany's military actions in Danzig will inevitably lead to direct action from Britain and France. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Various newspapers here recently continued to publish news stating that several old ships, fully loaded with guns and ammunition, were secretly transported from East Prussia, Germany, to the Port of Danzig to unload. These old ships pretended to be heading to the Port of Danzig for repairs to avoid the attention of Polish customs officials. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - The Daily Pictorial here recently reported that, in addition to establishing a "Volunteer Corps" in the Free City of Danzig, a special border defense team has also been formed. In addition, 3,100 military blankets used by the Volunteer Corps were made by a factory in Upper Silesia Province, Poland, and this matter should be thoroughly investigated. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>German Cruiser to Visit Danzig Date in Late August</h3>
<p>Warsaw - Responsible sources here recently confirmed that the German government has notified the Polish government that its cruiser "Königsberg" will arrive at the Port of Danzig in late August to hold a memorial service for the German cruiser "Magdeburg," which sank in the waters of the port during the European War. It is reported that the Polish government has not raised any objections to this matter. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Regarding the German cruiser "Königsberg" scheduled to sail to the Port of Danzig in late August, the general public here believes that it is not of great significance. In recent years, it has not been the first time that German warships have sailed to the Port of Danzig. In 1936, the German cruiser "Leipzig" sailed to the Port of Danzig. At that time, the captain of the ship only visited the authorities of the Free City and did not visit the High Commissioner of the League of Nations to the Free City of Danzig, which caused a dispute. Then, in 1937, six German mine-laying ships sailed to the Port of Danzig. The captains of each ship visited the Chairman of the City Council and the Polish High Commissioner, and also visited the High Commissioner of the League of Nations. This time, the "Königsberg" has precedents to follow. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Prepares to Build New Ships Supply Ships and Repair Ships</h3>
<p>(London) The naval reporter of the Sunday Times claimed that, in view of the recent development of the German Navy, it is certain that Germany is now planning to prepare several supply ships and repair ships sailing at sea to compensate for its lack of overseas naval bases. These warships can be used as activity bases for submarines and small ships operating in the North Sea, and can enable them to operate for a long time after leaving the main base, and can also maximize the use of the ports of allied countries. The reporter also said that the German Navy's preparation for these supply ships has only recently begun. Because the German naval authorities have assigned this work to various shipyards, the construction of other warships will inevitably be delayed, so although several ships have been ordered, on the other hand, some merchant ships will be converted for application. According to reports, Germany currently has eight submarine supply ships and two motor torpedo boat supply ships, while the British Navy, whose mission covers the world, has only eight such supply ships that can sail at sea. A comparison of the two is worthy of attention. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Italian Newspapers Warn Britain and France Not to Cause Trouble and Start a War</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian political magazine "International Relations" published an unsigned article today stating that Britain and France's attempt to maintain the status quo in Danzig will inevitably lead to a European war. The Axis powers will automatically use their military force to prevent the democratic countries from interfering in the Danzig issue. Italy will also take this opportunity to satisfy its demands on French territory. This article was clearly authorized by the government to warn Britain and France and Turkey not to get involved in Balkan affairs. (Reuters Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(Rome) The attitude taken by Britain and France towards the current international situation has recently been commented on by various newspapers here. They all said that the current policies of these countries are only aimed at intimidating Germany. However, the annexation of the Free City of Danzig to Germany is inevitable. This kind of intimidation is of no value. In addition, the titles used by the newspapers all fiercely attack the democratic countries of Britain and France, or say that the "anti-peace movement is developing," or say that "Britain and France are trying to prevent inevitable events, only to see their efforts wasted." (Havas Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations Optimistic in London New Anglo-French Proposals Agreement Can Be Reached</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, diplomatic circles here today expressed optimism. They all said that new proposals from Britain and France have been sent to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and an agreement is expected to be reached quickly. The contents of the proposal have not been published. According to people close to the government, European countries whose territorial integrity and sovereign independence are of vital importance to the survival of one of the three countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, although their names are not listed, the nature of the proposal is quite broad and sufficient to deal with all situations. As for the details of the talks between the representatives of Britain and France and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at noon today, the official here strictly adhered to secrecy, but judging from the fact that the French Chargé d'Affaires in Britain had contacted officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specializing in Eastern European affairs twice at noon and in the evening, it can be seen that Molotov may still have put forward some opinions on the new British and French proposals. Fortunately, the situation in Europe has recently become tense again, especially the Danzig issue. The negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have been affected and can be accelerated to reach an agreement as soon as possible. (Havas Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Devastation of Chinese Fisheries</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, since the Japanese announced the implementation of a blockade of the sea off Guangdong Province last September, Chinese fisheries have suffered 10,000 deaths and assets worth 20 million yuan due to the devastation of Japanese warships, including more than 1,000 fishing boats. It is reported that more than 30,000 fishermen are now unemployed and unable to make a living. Li Han-hun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, is paying close attention to this matter. It is reported that the provincial government has ordered fishermen to switch to agriculture or other occupations. If they still have to make a living by fishing, they should pay attention to avoiding Japanese warships to avoid being bombed. Although counties such as Zhongshan are very close to the sea, there are currently no marine fish for sale. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Impact of Japanese Blockade on Foreign Trade</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman today criticized the Japanese blockade of the southeastern coast of China, especially the operations in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. These battles will not affect the import of weapons and ammunition into China, nor will they affect export activities, because since the military, China has stopped using the southeastern coast for these purposes. On the other hand, the Japanese blockade will affect foreign trade in China. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)</p>

<h3>The Situation of the Chinese Army Withdrawing from Shantou City Taiwanese Ronin Provided Internal Support British and American Nationals Determined Not to Leave Shantou, Chenghai, and Anbu in Intense Fighting</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese army began to invade Shantou City on the evening of the 20th. All military police teams mobilized to fight. By the morning of the 21st, before dawn, the rumbling sound of airplanes was already heard in the low sky. A total of forty-two airplanes, in groups of three or five, were scouting the suburbs of Shantou and bombing refugees who were fleeing, dropping bombs like rain. At this time, most of the fleeing people were bombed to death at Zhongshan Park and the Chenghai Road intersection. Those hiding in the shops were unharmed. A large aircraft, rarely seen in peacetime, scattered absurd leaflets in the sky and then landed in the port. Its length was equal to that of a ship, and it seemed to be manufactured in Germany. After the Japanese aircraft landed, the traitors in the city revealed their true colors and began to move in groups of five or six. The police security team and volunteer team were no longer seen in the city, but they all took off their uniforms, lay on the roofs, or hid in the ditches, holding firearms, preparing for everything. At about 8:00 in the morning, six traitors ran to the clock tower of the Customs Inspection Factory in front of the customs and raised the Japanese flag. Another Japanese flag was planted on the highest tower of the Central Hotel, and a flag was also planted in front of the city government gate by traitors. Another traitor was holding a flag and signaling at the China Merchants Bureau pier. Fifteen Japanese warships outside Mazi Island, along with more than twenty steamships and speedboats, rushed in like they were entering an unmanned territory. At this moment, the blockade had been broken, and they sailed into the Port of Shantou. The Japanese marines first used more than ten speedboats to sail to the Rong River and landed near Pengzhou, Dajing, with the aim of attacking Anbu and cutting off the retreat of the people of Shantou. As soon as the Japanese warships entered, gunshots rang out in the city, and fires broke out in two places. All the machines in the Jinshan Street power plant were destroyed by landmines, and the Tongji Bridge was blown up. The traitors all had white cloths wrapped around their right arms. They were all Taiwanese ronin who used to live in Shantou. They ran to the Jieyang Pier and saw five "Daba Jiang" boats parked there, loaded with bean cakes (each cake worth five yuan). They called on unemployed vagrants and hooligans in the shantytowns to move the bean cakes away. In less than half an hour, all the bean cakes were robbed. The Japanese speedboats towed the boats away and transferred cavalry ashore. At noon, the artillery fire became more urgent. Airplanes flew rumblingly over Shantou City and scattered leaflets again, limiting all merchants to open their shops within three days and resume business as usual.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army controlled the entire Shantou, the Chinese army was still near the Qilu Airport and at Stone Fort, Zhaoshagang, Zhaoshang Street, Wubridge, Xialing Port, and in front of the railway station, still fighting to the death with the few against the many. On the evening of the 21st, the sound of gunfire and artillery did not cease. On the 22nd, the Chinese army quietly withdrew after it was said that Anbu in the rear was attacked and occupied. At that time, the Japanese army, which had landed from Dahao, had reached Jiaoshi, and the Japanese cavalry landed at the end of Shenzhao Road in Qilu. The horses were produced in northern Mongolia, and there were about 300 cavalrymen who chased the Chinese army along the Hudi Road to Anbu Meixi. The Fukuda unit of the Marine Corps suffered considerable losses when landing at the Airport on the 21st. They were stationed at the Japanese Consulate, the Da Dong Ice Factory, the Dongying School, the Japanese Elementary School, the City Government, the Lingdong Commercial School, and along Waima Road to the Customs Inspection Factory. The Aodong Garrison Headquarters was established at the Chaozhou Customs. It was said that more than ten steamships and eleven Japanese warships were parked on the sea to protect the newly established headquarters. Sentries were placed in front of the Post Office at Juping Road intersection, Yongping Road intersection, and Yushan Street intersection, prohibiting pedestrians from entering or leaving. The sentries held pieces of paper with the words "No traffic allowed here" written on them. Pedestrians who were slightly suspicious were shot. The ferry boats to Jiaoshi were moved to the Xidi Tongjin Street intersection, allowing only people to cross over to Jiaoshi, and prohibiting people from Jiaoshi and the suburbs from entering Shantou City. All 300 foreigners were in Jiaoshi. The warehouses of European and American foreign firms in Shantou City have been closed since then. A certain automobile company had about 200 new cars being assembled in the factory on Zhongshan Road, which were completely confiscated by the Japanese army. There were also five foreign ships parked on the sea. The refugees hurriedly got on the ships, not able to bring much luggage. The fare was 40 yuan per person to escape Shantou. Japanese Navy Commander Kondo Akria issued a notice to the British and American consuls in Shantou, limiting foreign ships, foreign vessels, and foreign nationals to withdraw within 24 hours, otherwise he would not be responsible. British and American merchants had been doing business, preaching, and running schools in Shantou for nearly 70 years. Their rights and properties were countless. They expressed indignation at the ultimatum-like notice. They exchanged opinions in Jiaoshi and vowed not to retreat. In order to accommodate the situation, the British and American consuls additionally transferred two warships to Shantou and decided not to give in. Foreign ships also continued to come and go to Shantou as usual. However, whether passengers and goods can be freely loaded and unloaded after import is very questionable.</p>
<p>The important buildings in the city have been occupied by the Mauri and Tianshan units, among others. There are not many people. The personnel, horses, and artillery vehicles carried by the Japanese transport ships, after being sorted out ashore, set off one after another. Outside Mazi Island, there are more than 100 various types of ships parked, especially many rubber speedboats. It seems that they are focusing on the line of North and South Port Donglong, Zhanglin, and want to use the floating corps to drive up Chao'an. Now there is fierce fighting in Chenghai Anbu. The Chaozhou Yangjiaoshi area is very quiet. Only a few hundred Japanese troops are making a feint attack. On the 23rd, the fire in Shantou City was extinguished. About twenty shops were burned down in the Jinshan Street area. The Six County Guild Hall has now become a den of foxes and rats. Smuggling traitors have come forward to form a false local maintenance association, and Chen Juemin has been appointed as the false chairman. A false organization will soon appear.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Reports: Japanese Army's Anti-British Movement in North China - Beiping Residents Forced to Participate in Failed Demonstration</h3>
<p>The "China Mail" Beiping correspondent reported on June 28th: In addition to blockading the British Concession in Tianjin and insulting the British there, the Japanese are now using Chinese newspapers under their strict control, along with posters, parades, rallies, and all other old methods, to incite anti-British sentiment throughout North China. So far, the Japanese efforts in this regard cannot be considered particularly successful. We still remember the intense and widespread anti-British demonstrations incited by the Communist Party and Kuomintang in 1925 and 1927. Currently, the attitude of the Chinese people towards this movement is</p>
<p>Completely Different</p>
<p>Clearly in contrast to the past, the people of Beiping were easily incited to participate in any anti-foreign demonstrations. However, in the current instance, they simply show no interest. The British should not flatter themselves and assume that the ordinary Chinese people do not participate in the current demonstrations because they love the British. The fact is that the people of Beiping dislike the Japanese even more than they dislike any other foreigners. This may surprise the Japanese. The experiences of the Chinese people under Japanese rule for two years have not inspired them to love the Japanese. The Japanese have used fraudulent tactics in the currency system, causing a sharp increase in the cost of living. The Japanese military police and the Chinese police controlled by the Japanese use oppressive measures. Even low-class Japanese people pour into Beiping, acting arrogantly and violently. Furthermore, the Japanese constantly regard themselves as conquerors. All of this has made it impossible for the Japanese to gain even a little goodwill from the people of North China. As a result, the Chinese are now suspicious and distrustful of anything the Japanese initiate. Moreover, in the past two years, the Japanese have engaged in so-called "voluntary" demonstrations, which, although numerous, have</p>
<p>All Ended in Failure</p>
<p>The Chinese are therefore tired of participating, so as not to continue making fools of themselves. The extensively publicized "All-China Anti-British Association" conference, held in the Forbidden City on June 23rd, is a clear example. The conference was a complete failure and became a laughingstock. From the beginning, the conference could not be called "voluntary," because only Chinese people with special red badges were allowed to attend. Foreigners had to be introduced and their business cards carefully examined before being allowed in. When reporters went to observe, they saw the usual groups of elementary school boys and girls and representatives, about a hundred flag bearers outside the venue, and no more than five hundred other attendees. People were constantly entering and leaving the venue, and no one seemed to pay any attention to the speeches. The speakers stood high on the platform behind microphones,</p>
<p>Speaking Incoherently</p>
<p>The place was far from where bombs could be thrown. Most of the audience wandered aimlessly in the square, while the schoolchildren roamed through the crowd, chasing each other for fun. The indifferent tone of the speakers was, of course, very different from the passionate and eloquent speeches of the anti-British rallies in 1925 and 1927. After the conference, a convoy of trucks carrying official participants drove through the main streets of Beiping, waving flags, shouting slogans, and distributing leaflets. These people showed ridiculous expressions of shyness. The overall impression of what the writers described as such a grand demonstration was only that the participants were indifferent,</p>
<p>Unwilling</p>
<p>The Chinese "hosting" this anti-British movement were people from the Chamber of Commerce, the Beiping Municipal Government, and Beiping educational institutions. It is not surprising that these people felt uneasy, because, as the reporter knows, some of them have indeed sent private letters to Chinese and foreign friends, saying that this action was actually contrary to their wishes. Because they were intimidated by the Japanese, they were forced to participate in this movement. Whether this is true or false, it is indeed a fact that those who are forced to engage in pro-Japanese propaganda and participate in political activities attract attention, and in this chaotic era, personal lives are often in danger. At the same time, Chinese newspapers in North China engage in fierce anti-British propaganda every day. These newspapers are all under strict Japanese control, so they cannot add their own opinions. Whether newspaper propaganda can be more successful than rallies and demonstrations remains to be seen in the future. So far, the entire movement has achieved something</p>
<p>The Opposite Result</p>
<p>The Chinese are now also secretly laughing at the Japanese, saying that because they cannot defeat General Chiang Kai-shek, they are trying to win a victory over Britain. This kind of talk that the Japanese are actually in a difficult situation was previously only heard among enlightened Chinese, but now it has spread among people of all levels.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Stirring in Northern Anhui - Repelled by Chinese Army at Wuhe, Puppet of Sicheng Captured</h3>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: On the morning of the 18th, about two hundred Japanese soldiers in eight ironclad boats landed on the opposite bank of Wuhe from Linhuai Pass and attacked Shijiaxiang. They were surrounded by the Chinese army's XX Detachment. After several hours of fierce fighting, two Japanese soldiers were killed and six or seven wounded. Afterwards, under the cover of artillery fire, they retreated along the original river channel to Linhuai.</p>
<p>Gao Xiuzhang, chairman of the puppet maintenance association outside Xiguan in Sicheng and concurrently head of the puppet Sixian Police Bureau, has now been captured by the Chinese army and escorted to a certain place, ready for execution.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invading Hainan Island Suffer Losses in Ambushes - Losses in Jiaji and Danxian, Japanese Air Force Harassing Guangdong and Guangxi from Hainan</h3>
<p>Beihai Dispatch: On Hainan Island, except for the coastal counties that can be reached by roads, most other areas are mountainous and densely forested. If the Japanese army ventures deep, they are often in danger of being ambushed. For example, in the battle near Zhongyuan, near Jiaji, six or seven hundred Japanese soldiers and more than ten tanks were surrounded by the Chinese army. Along the way, they also hit landmines, destroying six tanks. The Japanese army suffered casualties of more than half. In the Danxian area, Dana City was once invaded by the Japanese army, but later the Chinese army sent hundreds of troops to besiege the city. The Japanese army in the city ran out of food. Although the Japanese army used airplanes to transport food to the city to supply them, the Northeast soldiers in the Japanese army had no intention of fighting and defected one after another. The Japanese army's supplies in the city suffered considerable losses. In early June, the Japanese army at Wanshan Ridge in Qiongshan County invaded Tengchaling. There were more than a thousand Chinese soldiers at the ridge. When the Japanese army advanced to nearby villages, they intended to occupy the high ground and set up artillery positions to strike the Chinese army from a distance. However, the Chinese army recognized that the time had come and launched attacks from different directions, eventually capturing most of the Japanese army and seizing many artillery pieces. The ports of Qiongya usually have many local products. Since the coastal areas were occupied by the Japanese army, the fishing industry in each port has fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Recently, hundreds of Japanese soldiers in Xingying Port have been watching a certain mine in Danxian County and once invaded the area. However, the mine had long been infiltrated by the Chinese army, and when the Japanese army arrived, they launched interception attacks from different directions. Many Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded, and they abandoned their guns and fled in a panic. In the Haikou area, there are about a thousand Japanese soldiers. According to statistics from all counties, there are no more than five thousand soldiers in total. Most of them are from the Northeast, Taiwan, or Korea. Having been stationed in a foreign land for a long time, they harbor war-weary thoughts. If the Japanese commanders force them to fight, riots often break out. The commander of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, Ando, believes that the morale of the Japanese army stationed in Hainan is declining, so he sent three Japanese judges, Setada and others, to Haikou to discuss countermeasures with the heads of the Japanese army stationed in Hainan.</p>
<p>The Japanese army, unable to make any progress in Hainan, is now instructing its subordinates to choose key points and hold them to the death, so that the air force can carry out so-called "sweeps" from the air. Therefore, in recent days, the Japanese side has been rushing to build huge airfields in Wenchang, Ding'an, and Chengmai counties, and more than a hundred aviation trainees have been transferred from Taiwan and assigned to various airfields to serve. This batch of aviation personnel has been practicing for several months, and accidents and crashes occur from time to time. However, this batch of personnel has gradually graduated and is quite familiar with the air routes to Gaolei, Qinlian, and other places, as well as the routes to invade Guizhou Province. In preparation for aggression, the Japanese air force headquarters recently transported dozens of bombers and fighters to supplement the airfields of Haikou and Weizhou Island. Since then, Japanese aircraft in the south have been conducting reconnaissance flights more frequently than in the past, or crossing the border to invade Guangxi. According to investigations, there are currently eighteen aircraft at the Chengmai Japanese airfield, twenty aircraft at the Haikou and Wenchang airfields, and nine aircraft at the Weizhou Island airfield. On June 6th, fifteen Japanese aircraft took off and split into two batches. One batch of eight aircraft entered Yongchun via Qinlian and flew to Nanning in Guizhou Province, dropping more than twenty bombs. Bombs landed in places such as Delin Road Special Zone, outside the North Gate of Nanning City, and Hejing, killing six or seven civilians. A steamboat on the riverbank north of the city was also hit by a bomb and destroyed. Another batch of eight Japanese aircraft detoured through Lianzhou and ravaged Guixian in Guizhou Province for about two hours before joining the group and heading out to sea through Qinlian. On the 9th, twelve Japanese aircraft flew to Leizhou and circled over Anpu, without dropping bombs, only conducting reconnaissance and secretly photographing the terrain. They did not leave for the sea until 4 p.m. On the 10th, another twenty-four Japanese aircraft took off from Haikou, passed through Xuwen in Leizhou, and along the Leizhou Strait to Lianjiang. They then split into two teams, one team of twelve aircraft passed through Liangyang, flew to Xijiang, and attacked Zhaoqing. The other team of twelve aircraft turned into Guizhou Province and bombed Nanning again. It was not until about 4 p.m. that the Japanese aircraft were seen flying through Lianjiang back to Hainan one after another.</p>
<h3>Xiangxi Garrison - Organized into Two Divisions to Participate in the War of Resistance - People of Twenty-One Counties Bid Farewell Separately, All Sectors of Yuanling Hold Flag Presentation Ceremony</h3>
<p>Yuanling Dispatch: The Xiangxi area has always had a special regional situation, forming a traditional force. Since the Hunan Provincial Government actively developed it last year, national consciousness has generally developed in the local society. All the previously existing military forces have been completely unified through the collection and reorganization by Chen Quzhen, the director of the Xiangxi Pacification Office. Currently, they have been organized by the central government into XX Army, concentrated in XX for training, and participating in the second phase of the War of Resistance. Chen is the army commander, with Shen Jiucheng as his deputy. Dai Jitao and Long Yunfei are appointed as the commanders of the XX and XX divisions respectively. All the troops have been dispatched along the Xiangchuan and Xiangqian highways to designated locations for concentration. The people of twenty-one counties in Xiangxi held farewell ceremonies on the spot. On May 29th, all sectors of Yuanling held a flag presentation ceremony. More than a hundred representatives from the Third District Commissioner Wang Shi, County Magistrate Wang Qianheng, County Party Secretary Wu Xueyao, and various organizations jointly presented two embroidered flags. The two division commanders, Dai and Long, respectfully accepted the flags amidst the sounds of military music and firecrackers, and gave farewell speeches to the representatives, stating, "It is undeniable that the Xiangxi region has always been isolated from the central government. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the people have also been stirred by the high tide, and they have no hesitation in taking up arms to defend the country. We are willing to lead the brave soldiers of Xiangxi to fulfill our responsibility to defend the country and win glory for Xiangxi. We are determined to make XX also know that the people of Xiangxi cannot be insulted." The speeches were慷慨激昂, unprecedented. Currently, all the troops have arrived at designated locations for concentrated training. The Xiangxi Pacification Headquarters was abolished at the end of last month, and the defense was taken over by the central government's XX Army. As for the bandit troubles in various places, they were declared cleared a month ago, and local armed forces have also formed anti-Japanese self-defense groups, which are being trained separately. From now on, the impression of the Xiangxi Special Zone will never exist in the minds of the Chinese people, and Miao education is also being implemented in districts. Recently, the Miao people may also have the possibility of mobilizing.</p>
<h3>Decline of Guangdong's Silk Industry Under Japanese Control - Silk Merchants Subjected to Restraints and Suffering Heavy Losses, Now Closing Down One After Another Due to Inability to Maintain Operations</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Dispatch: Guangdong silk is one of its special products. The most abundant production is in Shunde, followed by Nanhai, and then Panyu and Sanshui. More than ten years ago, during the heyday of the silk industry, the annual output was worth more than 20 million yuan. In Shunde County alone, there were more than eighty silk reeling factories, employing tens of thousands of silk reeling women. The mulberry, cocoon, and silkworm seed markets in the towns of Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, Leliu, and Longjiang were everywhere, making Shunde in its golden age. At that time, Guangdong silk was sold to the United States, with prices of more than a thousand yuan per hundred catties. Guangdong silk was of exquisite quality and smooth color, far superior to the products of Japan and Italy. Later, due to imperfect manufacturing methods and uneven fibers, it was gradually overwhelmed by Japanese raw silk in the American market. Afterwards, the invention of rayon had a major impact on the world silk market, and the impact on Guangdong silk was particularly significant. As the value of raw silk plummeted, those who planted mulberry trees and raised silkworms were unable to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, mulberry fields in various counties were mostly abandoned and used to grow other plants. The silk industry in Guangdong Province plummeted. In the past two or three years, the world raw silk market has recovered slightly. Although Guangdong silk has not been able to restore its former glory, it is not as bad as it was in the previous decade. A few months ago, Shunde fell, and silk merchants and silk reeling women fled one after another. The silk factories in Daliang and Ronggui all stopped operations. Recently, the Japanese army, which occupies Shunde, is trying to restore various industries and businesses in order to plunder resources on the spot for their own supplies. In particular, the silk industry is regarded by the Japanese as the largest part of foreign trade, so they pay special attention to it. As soon as the Japanese army occupied Daliang, they issued a notice to encourage the factories and silk merchants to resume business, with the Japanese army taking responsibility for protecting the start of silk reeling, as well as transportation and sales. The silk merchants were all concerned that there were rampant bandits in the inland, the order was chaotic, and the transportation was blocked and difficult. Most of them hesitated to move forward. Later, the Japanese army used coercive methods to intimidate the silk merchants, ordering them to reopen the silk reeling factories within a month, otherwise they would all be confiscated and confiscated. Under the lure and coercion of the Japanese army, in order to preserve their property, the silk merchants had to resume business with pain. Moreover, with the new cocoons coming on the market, the price was cheap, and they thought that resuming business by taking advantage of the opportunity would not be without great profits. Therefore, the first silk factories in Daliang and Ronggui to resume business were Guangjinglun, Lunchang, Daxing, Guangsheng, and Yuji. At that time, business was quite lively. Before long, the Guangzhou puppet organization's finance department raised funds from the silk factories, forcing them to pay self-defense group fees, self-defense fees, business taxes, and transportation protection fees. The names were cleverly established, and the exploitation was heavy. The silk merchants suffered, but there was nothing they could do. The daily output of each silk factory was quite abundant, and the exchange rate was high. In addition to paying various levies to the puppet organization and protection fees along the rivers, they could still make a small profit by shipping directly to Hong Kong for sale, which could also be done reluctantly. It is said that the Japanese believe that the silk industry in Guangdong Province can compete with the world silk market, so they have been plotting to seize it. Last month, Japanese merchants from Osaka, Kobe, Nagasaki, and Taiwan organized a South China Industrial Inspection Group to Guangdong. The name was to inspect various industries, but in fact, they hoped to seize the silk industry. As soon as the group arrived in Guangdong from Taiwan, the Guangzhou puppet organization first welcomed them and led them to the market towns of Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, Leliu, and Guanshan in Shunde to inspect the silk reeling factories and mulberry and cocoon markets. They investigated in detail the operating capital of each factory, the number of female workers, the output of raw silk, the business situation, and the types of machinery, made a list, and took it away. Before long, the Japanese army headquarters in Guangdong issued two orders: one was the order prohibiting the export of materials. In all areas under the control of the Japanese army, all industrial products, agricultural products, and various minerals, hardware, and appliances were not allowed to be privately exported and sold, and those who violated the order would be confiscated and severely punished. The second was the order to control the transportation and sale of raw silk. Silk merchants were not allowed to transport and sell privately. Raw silk produced in the areas occupied by the Japanese army was purchased by an agency specially established by the Japanese headquarters, and 600 military tickets were issued for every 100 catties. The current price of raw silk in Hong Kong is about 800 Hong Kong dollars per 100 catties. After the Japanese army took control, they bought it at a low price, packed it, and shipped it back to Taiwan and Japan on Japanese military ships, and then transferred it to Europe and the United States. The silk merchants knew that it would be very difficult to do business under the oppression of the Japanese and puppets. In addition, the puppet organization extracted heavily, and the costs were very high. However, by taking advantage of the high exchange rate in Hong Kong, they could still make a small profit if they could transport and export freely. However, once the Japanese army controlled and bought at a low price, not only was there no profit, but also losses. Therefore, there was no business to operate. In May, the silk merchants jointly used smuggling methods, colluding with the puppet organization's military police, and transported more than 500 dans of raw silk out of the occupied area by secret routes. When they sailed to the waters of Lingdingyang, they were unexpectedly detected by a Japanese patrol ship, intercepted, and escorted back to the naval headquarters for confiscation, worth more than 400,000 Hong Kong dollars. After this major loss, the factories in Daliang and Ronggui closed down one after another and ceased operations in June. There is a small amount of raw silk smuggled to central China, passing through the defense lines of the Chinese army for export. However, this route is also subject to customs inspection. According to regulations, for raw silk to be exported, foreign exchange must first be purchased at the National Bank, otherwise it cannot be exported. Currently, the silk industry in various counties in the occupied area is not only oppressed and plundered by the Japanese army, but also restricted by the customs. With so many restrictions, there is no opportunity to do business.</p>

<h3>Japanese Restriction on Foreign Ships to Shantou: British Ships Firmly Reject; Shanghai Japanese Consul-General Notifies Consular Corps Yesterday that Foreign Ships are Limited to One Entry per Week; Japanese Troops Attempt Another Landing at Yuhuan, Still Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that a Japanese naval spokesman stated yesterday (the 1st) while hosting newspaper reporters that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, notified the consular corps yesterday that the Japanese side would allow third-country ships to sail to Shantou once a week, provided that the Japanese Navy be notified 24 hours in advance. The Japanese authorities will only temporarily allow two types of items to be unloaded in Shantou to supply the people of third countries: food and mail. For nationals of various countries residing in Shantou, only one or two persons remain; the authorities have requested the relevant countries to deliver the mail of those persons via the ship sailing to Shantou once a week, or inquire whether the Yunnan, which set sail from Tianjin and is scheduled to arrive in Shantou on Saturday or Sunday, has arrived. The spokesman replied that he was seeking to receive this information, but if the ship had notified the Japanese authorities, it might have already been allowed to enter. He also stated that naval operations against Fuzhou had not yet ended, and that the evacuation of third-country nationals seemed to have been agreed upon locally.</p>
<p>**British Ships Insist on Continuing to Sail to Shantou**</p>
<p>In order to maintain navigation in Fujian and Guangdong, British firms Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson are dispatching the new Beijing from Shanghai to Quanzhou in Fujian. Ships sailing between Shanghai and Hong Kong will also serve Shantou in Guangdong. British ships departing from Shanghai include the Guangdong on the 4th, the Yosho on the 5th, the Kweesheng and Chengdu on the 7th, and the Kiungchow and Wosheng on the 8th. They are determined to reject Japanese obstruction. British warships are currently stationed in Shantou, Quanzhou, and other locations to protect the navigation of merchant ships.</p>
<p>**Fierce Battle at Yuhuan: Japanese Troops Fail**</p>
<p>According to news from shipping circles in this port, after the Japanese troops who landed on Yuhuan were reported to have been recaptured after a large number of reinforcements from the Chinese side arrived to counterattack, at around 3 p.m. on the 1st, five Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Yuhuan suddenly fired over forty shells at the shore, launching more than ten motorboats full of Japanese soldiers, attempting to land under cover of artillery fire. The Chinese army waited for the Japanese motorboats to approach before unleashing a fierce machine-gun barrage, engaging in a fierce battle. Ultimately, due to the Chinese army's thorough defense, the Japanese troops failed to succeed. On the morning of the 2nd, two more Japanese warships arrived and shelled the shore. Chinese losses were very minor.</p>
<p>**Japanese Planes and Warships Continue Bombing Zhejiang**</p>
<p>Japanese warships are now constantly launching motorboats to patrol, while the Chinese army remains on strict alert. (2) Six Japanese planes invaded Wenzhou and dropped bombs at around 7 a.m. on the 1st, dropping five or six bombs in Yueqing as well. (3) Two Japanese warships anchored off Chuanshan fired over ten shells at the shore at 9 a.m. on the 2nd. (4) Eight Japanese warships are currently anchored outside the Min River estuary, shelling Guantou on the morning of the 1st. The local defense forces also returned fire. It is reported that the merchant ship Kang Sha Yi, owned by Yi Chang Kang, returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou the day before yesterday and berthed that evening. When the ship passed the Yuhuan River, the Japanese warship inquired with flag signals but did not encounter any obstruction.</p>
<p>**Japanese Warships Reconnoitering Jiaojiang, Alert Raised**</p>
<p>According to news from shipping circles, five Japanese warships arrived at the port of Haimen in Zhejiang on the morning of the 1st, launching motorboats to patrol and reconnoiter along the coast, seemingly with intentions. However, the Haimen Jiaojiang estuary had already been blockaded by the authorities, prohibiting navigation, and heavy troops were stationed for defense. If the Japanese army attempts anything, it will definitely not succeed. It is also reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Military Affairs Bureau has issued orders to be on alert to prevent the Japanese army from launching surprise attacks in various coastal areas.</p>
<p>**Evacuations Continue in Fuzhou and Wenzhou**</p>
<p>A large number of Japanese warships are anchored off the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang. Apart from occasionally shelling the coast, there has been no concrete action. Elite Chinese troops are continuously arriving to deploy defenses, and the defenses are extremely tight. Currently, residents of Fuzhou and Wenzhou are being evacuated by the authorities, and the situation remains peaceful.</p>
<p>**Wenzhou Compatriots Negotiate to Send Ships**</p>
<p>The Wenzhou Association of Shanghai issues a public notice: "Since the situation has become serious and transportation between Oujiang and Shanghai has been disrupted, many of our Wenzhou compatriots may urgently want to return home to handle affairs, but they are suffering from a lack of means due to the interruption of shipping. In view of this, the Association has specially requested a certain shipping company to send ships to stop at Shacheng in order to facilitate travel back home. Compatriots who wish to return home should come to the Association to complete the registration procedures before 12 noon on July 3rd in order to negotiate future arrangements. Special notice." The Association's office is located at No. 10, 3rd Floor, Tianlun Building, Paocqiu Chang, Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>**Guangdong to Sail from Shanghai to Shacheng Tomorrow**</p>
<p>The British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire has agreed to the request of the Wenzhou Association of Shanghai and has scheduled the Guangdong (2,626 gross tons, 1,572 net tons) to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong on July 4th, also stopping at Shacheng in Fujian. Passengers going to Wenzhou can take this ship, disembarking at Shacheng, then take the road through Fen Shui Guan, Pingyang, and Ruian to Wenzhou. There is a highway from Fen Shui Guan to Wenzhou. Rumors that the ship will also call at Wenzhou are inaccurate. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Shantou today.</p>
<p>**Moufou Unloading Not Yet Completed**</p>
<p>The German firm Melchers &amp; Co.'s Moufou, which sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 30th of last month, was blocked from entering after the Zhenhai estuary was blocked, and has been delayed for three days. The ship's passengers and cargo have been presented to the authorities for approval by the shipping company to arrange for unloading. A reporter from the New News Agency learned from the shipping company yesterday that the ship continued to unload remaining cargo yesterday and is expected to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>**New Beijing Arrives in Quanzhou**</p>
<p>The British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire is maintaining its shipping rights in China and continuing to operate ships to various coastal ports as usual. The New Beijing sailed directly to Quanzhou in Fujian province on the morning of the 1st. According to a telegram received by the company, the journey was very peaceful and is scheduled to arrive this morning. However, the Chinese military authorities have prohibited all ships from entering or leaving Quanzhou, so it can only anchor outside the port, with passengers and cargo transferred by lighter.</p>
<p>**Shenhua Arrives in Shanghai, Shenai Arrives in Sanduao**</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice learned from a British firm yesterday: (1) The Shenhua, which returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou, arrived in Shanghai at 2 p.m. yesterday and berthed at buoys 30 and 31 in Yangshupu. (2) The Shenai telegraphed Shanghai, reporting that it had arrived safely in Sanduao after loading stones. (3) The Shenyou and Shenfu are temporarily berthed in Shanghai. (4) The Shenguang is still berthed in Chuanshan, with 1,400 tons of cargo still not unloaded. As for navigation between Shanghai and Min, there are currently no ships sailing because the situation in Fuzhou Chuanshan remains serious.</p>
<p>**Two British Ships Pass Shantou Without Entering Port**</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that according to news received in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st), when the British ships Guangdong and Westistan anchored eight miles from Shantou on June 28, Shantou did not appear to be blockaded. Apart from one Japanese destroyer, no other Japanese warships were seen by the passengers of the two ships. However, the two ships were blocked off Sand Island by the British destroyer Searcher. According to the captain of the Searcher, he had received instructions to block British ships while negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities were still in progress. The wife and children of the Swedish consul in Shantou, who were passengers on the Guangdong, another Western woman, and an American passenger from the Westistan, all transferred to the British warship Searcher and went ashore in Shantou. Both ships had armed guards, four sailors each.</p>
<p>**British Naval Authorities Advise Leaving Shantou**</p>
<p>After being anchored off Sand Island for nearly eight hours, the ships were advised to leave Shantou by the British naval authorities, who stated that because negotiations were delayed, they would have to wait another 24 hours. The two ships left Shantou at 2 p.m. on the 28th. Although there were about 20 Japanese transport ships in the port of Shantou, passengers on foreign ships anchored off Sand Island did not see Shantou blockaded or Japanese naval patrols, only one destroyer and six armed motorboats. There was no air force activity, only one Japanese seaplane flying low over the port to Cape of Good Hope, fifteen miles south of Shantou. (Translated text) Public opinion believes that the British naval authorities did not want any unfortunate incidents to occur while negotiations were in progress, so they blocked British ships from entering the port.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Sanatorium Borrowed for Jewish Children's Summer Camp</h3>
<p>The buildings of the Hongqiao Tuberculosis Sanatorium, established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, have been empty for a long time. Now, an organization for the relief of Jewish refugees has borrowed them for a summer camp for Jewish refugee children. The camp's woodworking section is located on private property somewhere, but its buildings are insufficient, so it plans to borrow the empty buildings of the sanatorium. At a meeting on the 28th of last month, the Council Board decided to allow the organization to borrow them free of charge.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Filing, New Remittance System to be Implemented Tomorrow; Inspection Committee Formed, Increasing Market Funds; Eliminating Speculation, Stabilizing Shanghai's Financial Market</h3>
<p>Shanghai's banking and money exchange industries have implemented a new remittance system to regulate interbank funds and supply commercial and industrial needs. This has been approved and filed by the Ministry of Finance. In the future, measures to eliminate speculation, stabilize the financial market, and concentrate bill exchange will be implemented simultaneously after a decision is made. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>**Provide Guarantees to Obtain Remittance Allocation**</p>
<p>The banking and money exchange industries jointly decided to handle the allocation of new interbank remittances starting from July 4th. All banks and firms have provided property as collateral and registered with the Bank Union Reserve Committee. After the Committee has assessed the value and approved the allocation, it will transfer the interbank accounts of each bank and firm and issue checkbooks for use. These checks, which are the new remittances, are issued by each bank and firm with seals and signatures, and the Reserve Committee pays upon presentation of the checks. Holders of these new remittances can exchange them for remittance certificates from the Reserve Committee when necessary, which have the same effect as banknotes from the Silver Reserve Committee. Foreign banks have agreed to use them as collateral for clearing and have endorsed this new remittance system.</p>
<p>**Elect Committee Members to Form Inspection Committee**</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice learned from the Bank Reserve Committee yesterday that regarding the organization of the Interbank Remittance Reserve Inspection Committee for the banking and money exchange industries, after the Free Bank Reserve Committee sent letters requesting the nomination of committee members, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Money Exchange Industry Association, the Foreign Bankers' Association, and the four major Chinese banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural) have all internally determined the candidates. The first committee meeting will be held after the nominations are reported, and its establishment will be announced. As for the date for inspecting remittance reserves, it is planned to be at the end of each month, and the types, amounts, and numbers of collateral pledged for interbank remittances will be announced separately to ensure credibility.</p>
<p>**Legal Tender Shortage Increases Remittance Allocation**</p>
<p>Shanghai's situation is unique. Although it has become an isolated island geographically, the influence of its financial power is still sufficient to influence part of China's financial situation. For example, international exchange rates are still centered in Shanghai. The Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that if legal tender were supplied as before to increase market funds, then too much legal tender would flow out and fall into the hands of unscrupulous people, which would only fuel speculation, has made every effort to tighten the supply of legal tender in Shanghai, such as restricting the carrying of legal tender to Shanghai and unifying the payment of various debts in Chongqing. In order to meet Shanghai's current needs, the banking and money exchange industries are implementing interbank remittance allocation, which is a good way to solve the problem of market funds.</p>
<p>**Ministry of Finance Approves Filing**</p>
<p>Regarding the new remittance system, the banking and money exchange industry association submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, which has been approved and filed by the Ministry. According to a reporter from the New Voice who interviewed the banking and money exchange industry, remittances after 8/22 are different in nature from the previous remittances that were cashed the day after tomorrow. However, because legal tender is generally used in the market, and the large population of Shanghai requires legal tender for daily life, the remittances after 8/13 are not sufficient to meet Shanghai's current needs. After the new remittance system is implemented, it can be widely circulated and can also be used to remit funds to the interior to purchase local goods, so it can be said to be used in the same way as legal tender.</p>
<p>**Banking and Money Exchange Industries Centralize Exchange**</p>
<p>After the banking and money exchange industries decided to centralize the clearing house, the money industry reserve bank adopted a entrusted agency exchange method to participate in the banking clearing house. The library's 42 member money houses all entrust the money library to act as an agent. The banking clearing house specially set up booth number 50 (Spring) (that is, representing the money industry reserve library) for exchange, and the 42 member money houses represented by the library are listed as numbers 1 to 42. It is tentatively scheduled to be implemented from July 4. As for the original exchange of money industry, the exchange of bills of various money houses is still handled as usual, the time is from 1 pm to 2 pm every day.</p>
<p>**Second Step: Issuing Remittance Certificates**</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the New News Agency who interviewed the banking industry, the procedures for banks and money houses to receive and use remittances are: (1) The receiving banks and money houses first provide property as collateral. (2) The evaluation committee evaluates the price of the collateral. (3) The Bank Union Reserve Committee transfers the interbank remittance accounts of each bank and money house according to 70% of the price assessed by the evaluation committee, and issues checks for use. (4) All checks issued by the banks and money houses are paid by the Bank Reserve Committee. These checks are interbank remittances and can circulate in the market. However, in order to facilitate the transfer between industries, the Bank Reserve Committee will prepare to issue interbank remittance certificates in the second step and is currently drafting regulations, which will stipulate the amount and types of issuance.</p>
<p>**Suppress Premium to Eliminate Speculation**</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance's Ma Telegram restriction on withdrawals and the banking and money exchange industries' measures to stabilize the market are implemented, Shanghai's financial market will become more stable in the future, which can (1) eliminate the speculative boom in the Shanghai market and stabilize the market; (2) encourage the transfer of funds inland and strengthen the foundation for resistance. The premium on remittance bills may disappear on its own in the future. In addition, a reporter from the New Voice learned from the Money Exchange Industry Association yesterday that the number of money exchange houses in Shanghai has surged after the war. Many have joined as members of the Association, but there are also many who are unable to join or have not joined. Most of the money exchange houses that operate remittance premiums are not members of the Association. The Association has advised its members to pay attention to this remittance premium in order to avoid fueling speculation.</p>
<p>**Market Stabilization Restores Normalcy**</p>
<p>After the new remittance system is implemented, Shanghai's market will increase new funds, enabling all industries to no longer feel a lack of funds. Therefore, markets such as securities, grains, flour, yarn, beans, rice, sugar, and northern and southern goods will all open on the 3rd or 4th. Due to the increased funds, market transactions are gradually returning to normal. In addition, the rumors of new circulating notes in Shanghai in the past week have been confirmed by all parties as inaccurate, because under China's current legal tender policy, which is extremely stable, there is no need for them, and the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, and instead cause market fluctuations.</p>
<h3>French Concession Health Department Actively Prevents Epidemics; Forcibly Injects the Public, Starting from the First District</h3>
<p>The weather has been alternately cold and hot in recent days, so various seasonal epidemics are emerging and the numbers are increasing sharply, especially typhoid fever and cholera. Although the health departments of the two concessions have notified citizens to go to the various health departments to receive epidemic prevention injections, the general public often avoids them. For this reason, the French Concession Health Department has had to take decisive measures, dispatching a large number of personnel, together with the police, to the first district (i.e., the Bund to Avenue Foch, Avenue Edward VII to the boundary of the Puyuan Chinese district) to forcibly inject the public along the way to ensure the safety and health of citizens. This work will continue until all citizens have been injected, and then will proceed to other districts.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Friendship Association Charity Sale Opens; Mrs. Sun Ruihuang Cuts the Ribbon, Scene at the Venue is Extremely Lively</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industry Friendship Association of this city held a charity sale of national goods to aid the disaster. The opening ceremony began at 9 am yesterday. Lin Kanghou, Sun Ruihuang, Pan Yangyao, and other members of the presidium, as well as more than 200 people from the silver and money industry, arrived. First, Sun Ruihuang gave an opening speech, and Lin Kanghou and Pan Yangyao gave instruction speeches. Mrs. Sun Ruihuang, Huang Guoxiu, performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and then visited the venue. The scene was extremely crowded. In just one hour, more than 500 yuan were sold. It is reported that the association has changed the duration of the event to two days of charity sales in advance.</p>
<h3>Lu Ying Assassination Case Involves Coolies; Japanese and Puppet Police Conduct Extensive Searches, Accusing Suspects and Detaining them for Interrogation</h3>
<p>The puppet "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Chief" Lu Ying, on the other day, took his own car from his residence in Hongkou to the puppet "Bureau" in the central area of the city to handle official business. When the car drove to near the Maojiazhai on Qimei Road (now renamed Matsui Road), it was suddenly ambushed by seven or eight people lurking in the weeds on both sides of the road, who jumped out and attacked Lu's car with pistols. Because the driver was alert and accelerated, speeding away, they managed to escape. After the incident, the Japanese and puppet police mobilized everywhere and conducted extensive searches, searching house by house in the areas of Gongmei Road, Baoan Road, and Linping Road, causing residents to feel uneasy. On the other day, several coolies of Jiangbei origin, including a Zhang, who lived in a corrugated iron shed on Miaohou Road, were arrested and interrogated, accused of being involved in the Lu assassination.</p>

<h3>After the Fall of Dinghai City; Chinese Troops Firmly Defend the Suburbs of Wangcheng; Counterattacked All Night That Evening, Both Sides Suffered Casualties; Battles at Baiquan, Dazhan, Qingling, and Baihushan</h3>
<p>Since Dinghai was landed on by Japanese troops on the 23rd of last month, the battle is now still unfolding in areas of Baiquan, Qingling, and Baihushan, Dazhan. Here are the continued circumstances recorded:</p>
<p>**Prisoners Released**</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops landed three times at Shenjiamen, Yancang Road, and Daotou, the situation inside Dinghai City became very urgent. In addition to ordering the police force to quickly resist, County Magistrate Su also issued an order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, ordering Director Lu of the prison bureau to release all new prisoners in the county prison and detention center in order to avoid injuring the innocent.</p>
<p>**Investigation of Civilian Casualties**</p>
<p>He Asheng, a farmer from beside the Tanshudian Temple outside the East Gate of Dinghai County, carried firewood into the city to sell on the 23rd. On the way, when passing the Tongsoutai Wine Shop on the Xinqiao Bridge in the East Gate, he suddenly encountered several Japanese soldiers who, without asking about the situation, shot him in the neck, causing him to bleed profusely. His life is not in danger. In addition, Gao Liangcai (23 years old), a member of the wartime political work team, was shot and broke his left arm while on communications duty, passing through Japanese military defense area. He has now been transported to an island for medical treatment. In addition, there are four or five unnamed men and women who were injured by stray bullets and sought treatment at the Catholic Church Hospital.</p>
<p>**Japanese Troops Weary of Fighting**</p>
<p>After our army retreated in tears to the suburbs of Wangcheng on that day, they began to counterattack at 12 o'clock that evening. On the North Gate side, it was led by Zhang Fucheng, the first battalion commander of the Resistance and Defense Team, and the West Gate was personally commanded by County Magistrate Su. We used machine guns and grenades to attack the Japanese soldiers in the city, and the Japanese army responded with machine guns and small steel cannons. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the sound of gunfire was endless. The local armed civilians' volunteer police force and police officers also participated in the battle. It only stopped at 5:00 am at dawn. Both sides suffered casualties. There are still battles in Baiquan, Dazhan, Qingling, Baihushan, and other places. The Japanese army has not been able to rest and will soon be weary of running around.</p>
<h3>American Community Enthusiastically Celebrates Independence Day; Flag Raising Ceremony to be Held Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is American Independence Day, and the American community in this city has decided to celebrate enthusiastically according to established customs. At 9 am, a flag-raising ceremony will be held at the American School at 10 Avenue Petain. The US Fourth Naval and Marine Corps will play the national anthem. American residents of this city and all students will attend to participate, and Commander Fagan of the US Fourth Navy will deliver a short speech.

<h3>French Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; French Consul-General and Others Go to Wharf to Welcome; Also Sent a Team of French Soldiers to Protect Along the Way</h3>
<p>The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, arrived in Shanghai on the 30th of last month, taking the President Cleveland of the American President Lines. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 12:30 pm yesterday, berthing at buoys 12 and 13 in Yangshupu. The French Ambassador took a special ship from the Jianghai Customs and arrived at the New</p>

<h3>Chen Guangzong and Jiang Hechang to Regain Freedom; No Political Suspicion Found</h3>
<p>Chen Guangzong (former chief of the first section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau), director of the Datong Business Company on the upper floor of the Guangdong Bank at 353 Kiangse Road in the Public Concession, and Jiang Hechang, the chairman of the company from Ningbo, were arrested at 11 am on the 9th of last month by five plainclothes Japanese agents, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the police station. At that time, the Japanese side accused Chen and Jiang of political activities in Shanghai, but after a thorough investigation by the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, they were confirmed to be legitimate businessmen with no political activities and no criminal behavior. Therefore, Chen and Jiang were treated with great courtesy, but the Japanese side repeatedly requested extradition to be taken for questioning. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department approved their transfer to the Japanese side on Monday of last week for investigation at the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in the Waitan Water Hotel. It is now known that the Japanese side has completed the investigation and found that Chen and Jiang are innocent, so they were sent back to the Police Department on the 30th of last month. At that time, the office staff had already left, so they were released by the police authorities at 12 noon on the other day and regained their freedom.</p>
<h3>Unceasing Drizzle All Day; Vegetable Transportation to Shanghai Sharply Reduced; Vendors Use This as an Excuse to Increase Prices, Ordinary People Suffer Greatly</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, due to the unceasing drizzle these days, the soil is muddy and slippery, and those who make a living by transporting vegetables dare not move forward. In addition, local taxes are heavy and inspections are strict. The quantity of various vegetables transported to Shanghai has been sharply reduced. Although local goods stores have tried to purchase them to meet market sales, they have ultimately not been able to increase the source due to transportation difficulties. According to news from local goods stores yesterday, the market in Shanghai for these goods has increased sharply since the outbreak of the 8/13 war due to the concentration of population and the increase in sales. Therefore, after the source is scarce, the inventory has been reduced, and the market price has risen. Those who eat vegetables are the most affected. They are advised to purchase them from the place of production as soon as possible to meet market sales. At a time when all prices are rising, the livelihood of ordinary people is becoming more difficult. Although they have already saved on expenses, their income is small, and they are truly unable to make ends meet.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Harass Beisha; Warfare is in Progress; Garrison Troops Calmly Respond to Japanese Landing Attempts, Foiled</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, Japanese warships and motorboats are daily shelling the various ports of Beisha. The Chinese army calmly responds, and Japanese attempts to land have been foiled. However, Japanese warships continue their harassment. At night, they dare not anchor in the sea areas of these ports, but instead sail back to anchor outside Qinglong Port. The Chinese troops stationed at each port have strengthened their defenses and are on high alert to ensure safety. The local situation is as calm as usual, and the people are also very calm. Passenger ships to and from Shanghai and Beisha continue to operate as scheduled, but cannot directly reach Shanggang.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Continue to Sail to Qinglong Port</p>
<p>Since the Japanese navy has been obstructing foreign ships from sailing the Beisha route, the Jianghai Customs has agreed to the Japanese request, refusing to clear ships to and from Haimen and Qidong. Therefore, ships sailing the Beisha route have changed to Qinglong Port for customs clearance and continue to dispatch ships. Currently, except for the British Swire Company's Wanto, which is temporarily suspended, and the Portuguese Deya, represented by the Italian Yihua Shipping Company, which is undergoing repairs, other ships, such as the British Jardine Matheson's Yihe, the German Hende Lisha Jiangding Haiyi, and others, are operating as usual. Their customs clearance location is Qinglong Port.</p>
<p>Temporary Docking at Various Ports in Shanggang</p>
<p>As for Xin Port, Lingdian Port, Sanhe Port, and Dong No. 1 Port, they have temporarily suspended docking due to Japanese notification of obstruction of navigation. However, whether Huxun Port, Niuhong Port, Shuji Port, Songji Port, and Lao Hong Port, Jian Bay will be docked is yet to be determined. If there is no Japanese warship obstruction upon arrival at these locations, they will continue to dock as usual. Otherwise, they will also temporarily suspend docking. Due to the Japanese obstruction, the business of each ship has declined daily, and there are very few passengers and goods.</p>
<h3>City Federation Requests Improvement of Sanitation on North Fujian Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Public Works Department's Sanitation Department yesterday, stating: "Regarding the previous letter from the 37th District Branch of the Federation, stating that due to the numerous night soil carts passing through North Fujian Road from morning to noon, many of which are broken and leaking, hindering sanitation, the Federation requested three points from the Public Works Department's Sanitation Department: (1) Disperse the night soil carts to avoid excessive concentration on the road; (2) Shorten the passing time; (3) Ban broken and leaking vehicles. It has been a long time since the request was made, and it has not been implemented. At this time of scorching heat, it is very likely to cause epidemics. Therefore, we specially request your department to forward the letter to the Public Works Department's Sanitation Department for prompt improvement, etc. Upon investigation, the broken and leaking night soil carts on North Fujian Road and the excessive passing time have caused great suffering to the citizens on the road, which is indeed the truth. Accordingly, we request your department to consider the importance of public health and promptly improve the situation, and we hope that more water sprinkler vehicles will be dispatched to spray on the road to clean the streets and emphasize sanitation."</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Open Fire in Suzhou Creek, Wounding Boatman</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that Dong Jiyao, a 25-year-old Ningbo boatman hired by Yitaixing Coal in Xinza Road, was rowing a small boat to the mouth of the Suzhou Creek at 1:30 PM yesterday (the 1st) when he arrived east of the Waibaidu Bridge. Suddenly, a motorboat carrying Japanese soldiers approached. One of them fired a shot from a rifle, hitting Dong's right arm. The reason is unknown. Dong tried to land on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek and asked a Chinese policeman for help. He was first taken to the Central Police Station and then rushed to Renji Hospital. It is reported that his injuries were satisfactory last night. It is believed that the Japanese motorboat was trying to navigate the crowded waterway, and Dong was slow to give way, provoking the anger of a Japanese soldier, who then fired a shot.</p>
<h3>Gunshots Ring Out in Zhuanbang, Western Shanghai; Reason Unknown</h3>
<p>In a certain lane in Zhuanbang, Western Shanghai, a shooting incident occurred at around 4:00 PM yesterday. Upon receiving the news, the public concession police authorities dispatched armed detectives in patrol cars to be on guard because the area is a road-building area beyond the concession. When the police arrived, gunshots rang out again, lasting for a long time before ceasing. Whether there were any injuries is still under investigation. It is reported that there is a Heli gambling den in the area. The reason for the shooting is difficult to determine at this time.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Security in Chapei, Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, security has been tightened at the borders between the Chinese areas and the concession areas of the city. Pedestrians passing through the entrances and exits of Hongqiao Road and Daxi Road in Western Shanghai are required to present passes and epidemic prevention certificates, and the items they carry must be thoroughly inspected. At the railway crossing of North Xinjing and Caojiadu, passage is not allowed without a pass from the local military police headquarters. The family return permit issued by the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Headquarters is only valid for travel within the areas of Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Zhabei. Security at the Mint Bridge was also tightened yesterday. Pedestrians are not allowed to carry items. The Xinza Bridge only allows items to be carried from the concession to Zhabei, and not from Zhabei to the concession. Pedestrians are subject to individual inspection. Part of the traffic on Wuzhen Road Bridge is still allowed. Inspection of pedestrians on Sichuan Road Bridge and Waibaidu Bridge is also stricter than usual.</p>
<h3>Dr. Paterson (Part 1) - The Three Difficulties of Renji Hospital</h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>"To be honest with you, I'm very sorry," Dr. Paterson lowered his voice and said to me, "In the last seven years, I can't remember taking a single portrait except for taking a group photo in the state funeral." These were the words spoken to me frankly and humbly by Dr. Paterson, the president of Renji Hospital, when I asked him for a photo before leaving after my visit, as he flipped through a photo album.</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen Dr. Paterson (Dr. J. Lee H. Paterson, M.B., Ch.B.) before or recently—and there are probably many people in Shanghai who know him. Moreover, it is not necessary to be sick to have the opportunity to meet him. For example, the nursing students who have graduated from the nursing school attached to Renji Hospital are not among the patients—can always remember what kind of person he is. At least, they have a respectable, friendly, and responsible impression of the white coat worn by doctors, which represents his noble profession.</p>
<p>Stepping onto Shandong Road (going south)—the foreign cemetery adorned with broken monuments and remnants of the old garden; the Shen Bao, founded in the eleventh year of Tongzhi, with a daily circulation of 150,000 copies; and the Lester Chinese Hospital (Renji Hospital) in Maijiaquan, Shanghai's oldest and second-largest, run by the Christian Church—one of the three "old" things, I couldn't help but feel very grateful: I was neither "sent in"—which is almost a daily occurrence in the local news—nor "visiting"—I went at 2:30 PM, which is when everyone visits their sick relatives and friends—but "visiting" President Paterson in the white coat.</p>
<p>…Inquiry desk, registration desk, accounting office, dispensary, operating room…doctors, nurses, hospital staff…newly recovered patients leaning on crutches and walking, patients with extreme pain covering their heads with bedsheets and coming for treatment, seriously ill patients lying on stretchers being pushed into elevators and going up…Isn't that Dr. Paterson over there!</p>
<p>Under the armpit of his left arm, which had a red background with three white-letter LCH armbands, he was holding a board with the patient's medical records on it, and he was busy talking to a staff member. The pencil in his right hand was constantly poking at the record paper; in the middle of their conversation, he either used the tip of the pen to write or gently and rhythmically tapped the record paper with the tip of the pen. It seemed that all the surrounding disturbances had been conquered by order, training, and experience.</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. S, please come this way," Dr. Paterson led me into the president's office on the second floor.</p>
<p>Simplicity and rusticity are intertwined in this room, which is neither large nor small. While Dr. Paterson was making a phone call, I looked around and felt that it could not be simpler. In the center was a large desk with some stationery, a telephone, an ashtray, and some books; near the window was a small desk with several books, one of which was open—undoubtedly a foreign "spiritual essence" or something similar; on the four walls hung seven or eight landscape photos of various sizes, which were also simple and not heavily colored; in addition, there were one or two bookcases, several chairs, and one washbasin.</p>
<p>Doctors' time is like a young girl's spring, so we skipped the pleasantries and started talking:</p>
<p>"I was born on May 15, 1884, and I am 54 years old this year."</p>
<p>"I first entered Condall Middle School, then entered Rutherford College (Dr. Paterson explained to me that it was in Newcastle-on-Tyne—Tyne is the name of the river, he said). I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1906 with an M.B., Ch.B. degree."</p>
<p>"I married Miss C.M. Brown in 1912."</p>
<p>"I usually like to play tennis, and I used to play hockey."</p>
<p>I asked Dr. Paterson about his date of birth, education, marriage, and sports in order.</p>
<p>"Then, in what year did you come to China, sir?"</p>
<p>"In February 1908," Dr. Paterson replied, "I worked at this hospital from 1908 to 1910; in Wuchang from 1910 to 1912; and in Zao City, Tianmen, from 1912 to 1926. During the Great War from 1916 to 1919, I returned to my country and served in the Royal Army Medical Corps (R.A.M.C.); I returned to Shanghai in 1927."</p>
<p>Indeed, Dr. Paterson has a long history with Renji Hospital. Because after returning to China in 1927, he succeeded Dr. Davenport as the president of the hospital, and has been in that position ever since.</p>
<p>After ten minutes of conversation, I had almost obtained a rough outline of Dr. Paterson's past. During the pauses in our conversation, I silently observed the person being interviewed sitting across from me. He had a deep and resolute attitude and a bright spirit; his rich and rosy face was set off by a pair of bright eyes, and his head was covered with hair that was half silver-gray and half brown silk; during the conversation, he would occasionally lean back in his chair, revealing a broad and generous mind from his peaceful and natural laughter.</p>
<p>"Dr. Paterson," I asked, "What is the most difficult thing you have felt in managing the hospital for so many years?"</p>
<p>"Difficult?" Dr. Paterson replied, "Too many patients, too little space, and not enough money… those are the few difficult problems to solve."</p>
<p>From the "three difficulties" mentioned by Dr. Paterson, he provided me with several numbers. He said that in terms of patients, the number of outpatients at Renji Hospital averages between 800 and 1,200 per day; the number of inpatients is between 280 and 300. Currently, because everything is expensive, especially affected by the soaring exchange rate, the expenditure on medicines is particularly considerable.</p>
<p>As if talking to Dr. Paterson about the seven daily necessities, the wrinkles on his forehead inevitably tightened gradually. I then asked, "On average, how much does it cost to maintain one inpatient per day?"</p>
<p>"About 2.6 yuan per day," Dr. Paterson said slowly, "including all expenses, even the doctor's service fee."</p>
<p>If an average patient has to pay 2.6 yuan per day for medical expenses, wouldn't that be 78 yuan per month? This would become a very serious problem for families below the middle class, who are at the salary level.</p>
<p>"Then is it completely free?"</p>
<p>"In terms of percentage, free patients account for 45%; those who pay only 6 cents per day account for 40%; in addition, those who can pay 1 to 3 yuan or more than 3 yuan per day account for 15%," Dr. Paterson replied.</p>
<p>"So, nearly half of the patients can't afford their own medical expenses," I said.</p>
<p>"That's what I'm saying," Dr. Paterson said as he stood up and took two annual reports of Renji Hospital from 1937 and 1938 from the bookshelf to show me.</p>
<p>The entire working performance of the hospital and its economic situation are included in this 40-page report. According to a paragraph in the report by Sir Marshall, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, when he served as chairman at the annual meeting of Renji Hospital in mid-April this year, "Expenditures on almost every item under the regular account have increased; however, due to the careful and cautious management, the increase in this ratio is not as great as the increase in the income ratio. As a result, the expenditure exceeds the income by less than 2,500 yuan…"</p>
<p>It is certainly not an easy task for such a large hospital to have such achievements in terms of regular income and expenditure. According to Dr. Paterson, because the hospital has some property, it can barely manage to get by in terms of regular expenses. However, temporary expansion expenses are impossible to come by for the time being.</p>
<p>"Because there are too many patients and the location is too small, we very much hope to add a floor on the roof," Dr. Paterson pointed upwards at the house outside and said, "But the estimated cost is at least 25,000 yuan. Not only is the money unavailable, but we also need to purchase equipment and the usual maintenance costs." Speaking of this, he couldn't help but look at me with an unavoidable "bitter" smile for a moment.</p>
<p>We took the opportunity to end the question about the word "difficult." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Foreign Concessions in China Must Establish a Common Front to Cope with Japanese Danger; Concessions Affect All Trade; Japanese Demands are Endless</h3>
<p>The China Weekly Review states that the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin and the Gulangyu concession, the isolation of the French concession and other special zones in Hankou and the Shamian concession, and the Japanese pressure on the Shanghai Municipal Council have made everyone familiar with the true situation in the Far East. The Western concessions in China are all encountering a common danger, and Japanese pressure is rapidly infringing on Western rights and interests. Although the Japanese actions against these special zones vary in motive, and the methods of oppression in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Gulangyu are also slightly different, there is no doubt that militarist Japan has engaged in a</p>
<p>Huge Movement of Encirclement, Isolation, Boycott, Blockade, and Economic Severance</p>
<p>against all non-Japanese concessions in China. All Westerners are now in the same boat. There is no longer any illusion about the possibility of permanent arrangements with Japan regarding these special zones. Japan's attitude on this point has fundamentally changed. Even after the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan still enthusiastically supported the existence of concessions in China, whether they were Japanese concessions or not. Tokyo still used these areas as arrowheads to invade China. However, the current situation is completely different. The concessions are all in Japanese-occupied areas and are used as bases for opposing the concessions. Japan no longer regards the concessions as its own convenient "springboards," but as gateways for others to invade its occupied territories. Closing these gateways has become Japan's established policy. This policy has been repeatedly stated by the current Japanese Foreign Minister. In the name of the various puppet governments established by Japan in China, Japan demands the so-called "return" of the concessions. This demand has not yet taken the form of a real demand and has been formally submitted to the relevant Western powers, but it is expected to be submitted in the near future. Japan's current "purification war" against the special zones is preparing to</p>
<p>Strike the Final Blow</p>
<p>when it realizes its plan to weaken Western resistance one day.</p>
<p>Since Japan has this policy, there is little or no possibility of compromise. Painful experience has shown that every gain Japan makes from the concessions is followed by more demands, and there is no end to them. It is now repeatedly creating pretexts to take actions to reduce the independence of the special zones. No matter what concessions the concession management authorities make to Japan, the Japanese militarists will regard each new benefit as a stepping stone to achieve their ultimate goal of abolishing foreign-managed special zones in China. The Western powers have considered the final return of concessions in China more than once, but what they have considered is only the return to an independent Chinese national government. No</p>
<p>Western Power</p>
<p>has ever considered transferring its rights in special zones in China to non-Chinese powers, especially not to Japan. "Returning" the concessions to the puppet regimes created by Japan is no different from ceding them to Japan. These puppet regimes are entirely controlled by Japan and have fully proven that they are merely tools in Japan's hands for anti-Western discrimination.</p>
<p>Transferring the concessions to these regimes would cause great losses to American and European commercial interests in China. Japan itself may abandon its concessions in Tianjin and Hankou, because the entire</p>
<p>Japanese-Occupied Area</p>
<p>is already like a large Japanese concession. However, Westerners cannot do this. Their concession rights have now become the main rights to continue commerce in Japanese-controlled areas. However, although Japan is clamoring for the return of the concessions to China, the Japanese militarists have taken no action to hand over their concessions to the puppet regimes. This point is worthy of attention. The entire trading position of the Western countries is largely dependent on the continued existence of their concessions, so there is a close relationship between the two. This is especially true for the public and French concessions in Shanghai and the British and French concessions in Tianjin. According to trade statistics, the</p>
<p>Commercial Transactions</p>
<p>in these two ports have declined less than in ports entirely controlled by Japan, largely because of the existence of concessions in these two cities. In the first four months of this year, Chinese imports traded through Shanghai and Tianjin accounted for nearly 80% of the total. Of these imports, Shanghai accounted for no less than 46.76% and Tianjin accounted for 27.4%. More than 90% of the goods imported by Western countries into the Japanese-occupied areas enter China through Shanghai and Tianjin. The reason why these imports can be maintained is that there are concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin, which maintain an independent and open money market where foreign exchange can be freely purchased to pay for imported goods. If these circumstances change, the trade in Shanghai and Tianjin will be destroyed. If the public and French concessions are</p>
<p>Once Abolished</p>
<p>what will happen to Western commerce in Shanghai can be imagined. At that time, the entire city will become a "Greater Zhabei," where Japan dominates everything. "Permission, licensing, banning, and control" will emerge one after another. Exporters will have to obtain foreign exchange according to the arbitrary and fictitious exchange rate set by the Yokohama Specie Bank, and importers' foreign exchange will have to be determined according to the bank's opinion. Western ships in the Huangpu River will encounter the same situation as in Qingdao. We will only use the "Hongkou Bridge" or the Japanese yen. Our mail will be subject to strict inspection, and overseas mail will be</p>
<p>Newspapers and Books</p>
<p>will be detained, and the Nanjing puppet government will tax everyone. No one is unaware of the danger, but what is the countermeasure? Have those who can do anything done their best? There is no room for argument that foreign concessions and their residents are in the same boat. But have they cooperated to the extent required by the situation? The answer is no. If these areas had cooperated closely from the beginning of the war and dealt with Japan with a firm and common policy, everything could have been properly handled by now. Unfortunately, the opportunity has been missed, and it is too late to regret. However, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Gulangyu still maintain a position where they can offer united resistance, rather than just passively endure suffering. The administrative organs of these concessions should</p>
<p>Cooperate Closely</p>
<p>in terms of mutual communication, exchange of opinions, and mutual assistance. Even today, what should be done is not limited to this. When facing a common danger, they should unite, resist and manage together, and make the closest possible cooperation without delay. In recent weeks, Western diplomats in the Far East have established some direct contacts and cooperation between the aforementioned special zones, but this is by no means sufficient. Western diplomats must implement the instructions received from their respective governments, but their governments' policies towards the concessions are often passive, and the policies that diplomats are required to follow do not seem to be based on the interests of the concessions. From this point of view,</p>
<p>The Concessions in China</p>
<p>must have closer cooperation. Their interests urgently require the establishment of a common front to resolutely deal with the dangers of Japan and the policies of their respective governments. If there were a group of people today, whether in an official or non-official position, who could be generally regarded as the spokespersons for all special zones in China, their united statements, resolutions, and actions would have more influence on Japan and the Western home governments than the passive complaints of Western merchants in the special zones. If this group of people has a good position, influence, and independence, it will certainly be able to</p>
<p>Preserve</p>
<p>the interests of the threatened Westerners in China, especially in the concessions, and obtain the cooperation of similar interests outside of China. The Western interests in the British colony of the Philippines and Vietnam will also express sympathy, because they will also encounter the threat of Japan. This may not be the case at present, but once Japan tries to destroy the Western special zones in China, the Western interests in the above-mentioned areas will be in danger. In fact, not only Westerners in China, but all Western interests from Singapore to Vladivostok, are in the same boat. No matter how they compete, they have the same interest in firmly maintaining their inherent position to resist Japan's</p>
<p>Continued Expansion</p>
<p>If they firmly unite to deal with the enemy, they will not only achieve great success in direct resistance, but also exert a strong influence on public opinion and governments in their home countries, so that the Far East policies of the Western powers will immediately become more active than in the recent past. The most powerful white people in the entire Far East firmly believe in this, but mere deep belief is not enough. What the situation requires is thought and action. Important Westerners should take all matters into their own hands and take action, and it is expected that they will receive a huge common response.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Stamps to Celebrate American Independence Day will be Sold Tomorrow; Commissioned to be Printed by the American Bank Note Company, Adorned with Chinese and American Flags, Making them Very Precious</h3>
<p>The Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications has planned a set of commemorative stamps to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the United States on July 4th, and commissioned the American Bank Note Company to print them. They have now been transported from the United States to Hong Kong, and then distributed from Hong Kong to post offices in various places. They are scheduled to be sold on July 4th. There are four denominations: 5 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, and 1 yuan. A large batch has now arrived in Shanghai, and it is expected that philatelists will rush to buy them. It is reported that the commemorative stamps will be sold from July 4, 1939 to March 31, 1940. After the expiration date, the sale will be stopped. Within one month after the suspension of sale, from April 1 to April 30, 1940, they can still be used to pay for postage. From May 1, 1940, they will be abolished and cannot be used again. If there are still people who have these stamps, they can exchange them for ordinary stamps of the same value at post offices. It is reported that the commemorative stamps are adorned with Chinese and American flags, and the paper is exquisite and the colors are novel, which is unmatched by ordinary stamps.</p>
<h3>Original Intention of the Civil Service Commission Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's Increase in Subsidies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office sent a letter stating: "Regarding the news released by this bureau on the 28th of last month regarding the approval of increased subsidies for employees, there is a paragraph that states "...but the Civil Service Commission believes that the bureau should consider the treatment of employees at any time according to the social situation to ensure fairness. The recent increase in the cost of living should be considered by the bureau to determine how to subsidize employees..." The wording is slightly different from the original meaning. To avoid misunderstandings, the revision should be as follows: "But the Civil Service Commission believes that the public must always be prepared to give those who serve the public fair wages according to the situation. The public should consider the impact of the recent increase in the cost of living and should decide how to assist such people." We hereby request your newspaper to disclose this letter. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office."</p>
<h3>Charity Tea Dance Party - Promoting Association Affairs - Singing Competition Applications Overwhelming - Famous Stars to Participate in Dancing</h3>
<p>The Charity Tea Dance Party, organized by the dance hall group fundraising committee of the Municipal Refugee Relief Association, officially opened on the first of the month at the String Music Dance Palace. Guests from all walks of life have been very crowded. Now, in order to strengthen the lineup and consolidate strength, the conference has decided to hire social celebrities to form an advisory committee to assist in promoting association affairs, and to hire the film industry to form an entertainment committee to preside over various performance programs of the conference. In addition, dance hall managers will be hired to form a field affairs committee to be responsible for adjusting the dance star lineup.</p>
<p>Singing Competition: In addition, in order to increase the interest of guests, the conference has sought well-known ladies and singers from the sea to hold a singing competition. In recent days, many people have signed up, including Miss Zhu Yun, Miss Juan Juan, Miss Qin Yan, and Miss Fang Fang. The association will invite famous experts to form a judging committee to start the competition regularly. It is hoped that enthusiastic ladies will actively participate.</p>
<p>Red Stars Dancing: The conference has now obtained the participation of red stars from major dance halls on the sea to participate in dancing, such as Chen Manli from Paramount, who is allowed to dance on Saturdays and Sundays, and will participate for one day on the 4th (Tuesday). Zhou Meijun from Xianle is allowed to dance every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Xu Hong is allowed to dance on Sundays. Other first-class red stars have also been successively scheduled and will be announced in newspapers every day.</p>
<h3>Raising Funds for Refugee Hygiene - Citywide Joint Effort</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising Hygiene Fund Committee started fundraising on the 26th of last month, with the enthusiastic support of all sectors of society, the results have been quite considerable. Mr. Gu Keming, the director of the committee and manager of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, is usually happy to do good deeds. All social charities are generous in their donations. This time, he spared no effort to run around in order to raise more than 50,000 yuan. A few days ago, he invited Mr. Fang Jiaobo, a idle person at sea, to broadcast a speech on the Oriental Radio Station. The following is an excerpt of Mr. Fang's speech: Ladies and gentlemen, everyone, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in view of the large population of this city, and in this summer with sudden heat and high fire, epidemics are extremely easy to occur. Especially in Shanghai after the war, the occurrence of epidemics is of course unavoidable. Therefore, in order to be prepared, we have to find a way to raise a sum of hygiene funds. Thanks to the kindness of medical groups and social groups, a fundraising hygiene fund committee has been organized. This kind of heroic act is indeed worthy of our admiration. At the same time, the strength of these ten groups is very strong, so the result of the fundraising in the future must be considerable. A bit of achievement is to reduce our danger by a bit. Especially for the general refugees, they will get a lot of help. Because the nutrition of the refugees is of course inferior to ours, and in the summer when epidemics are spreading, refugees are of course easily infected. If the refugees have epidemics and are not treated quickly, then we will feel extremely dangerous. To avoid this danger is to find ways to eliminate it as early as possible. Therefore, our fundraising for hygiene funds this time is to prevent the occurrence of epidemics. The authorities of the concession are of course absolutely concerned, but such a crowded population is really impossible to prevent. In order to protect our safety, we must assist the authorities to work hard. I hope that all gentlemen will actively donate and work together to succeed. Saving people is saving yourself. At the same time, broadcasting blessings will be immeasurable. I have been the director of fundraising for the Refugee Association since October last year. Almost every day, I hope that kind people from all walks of life will pay close attention to the refugees. This time, I hope that all sectors of society will make even greater efforts to raise hygiene funds.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees Arrive Again - More Than 800 People - The Remaining 400+ Are Scheduled to Arrive Today</h3>
<p>860 German-European Jewish refugees were transported from Central Europe by the Italian postal ship Baike Mennor and arrived in Shanghai at noon the other day. Another 470 people were transported to Shanghai by the Oushalemo ship the day before yesterday. Together with the 30 people who arrived in Shanghai on the 26th, there are nearly 1,400 people. It is heard that the above-mentioned refugees are temporarily settled in Hongkou.</p>
<h3>Japanese Transport Ships - Gathered in the Huangpu River - Yesterday, Several Left the Port - Destination Unknown</h3>
<p>In recent days, Japanese transport ships have gathered in the Huangpu River. According to investigations, there are 15 ships including Liangyou, Zhaoqing, Jiuzhou, Yanzi, Yunhai, Beixi, Zhensheng, Haizhou, Shenlong, Takashima, Hailong, Kui Maru, and Ying Maru. Yesterday, several ships had left the Huangpu River and sailed to other places.</p>
<h3>Crime in the Public Concession Increases Sharply - Number of Prisoners Reaches Over 7,000 - Total of Over 2,400 Crime Cases in May, an Increase of 914 Compared to the Same Period Last Year</h3>
<p>According to the Public Concession Police Department, due to the sharp increase in population after the war, the large number of unemployed people, and the soaring prices and rising living standards, the number of crime cases has also increased proportionally. In the Public Concession, the number of cases that occurred in May of this year included 6 homicides, 5 attempted homicides, 4 murders, 13 abductions, 93 armed robberies, 13 other robberies, 52 burglaries, 46 pickpocketing thefts, 1,305 thefts, 34 harboring thieves, 116 snatching thefts, 84 opium cases, 46 gambling cases, and 587 other cases, totaling 2,404 cases, an increase of 914 cases compared to the same period last year, and an increase of 283 cases compared to April of this year. Therefore, the total number of prisoners in custody has reached 7,432, which is a serious overcrowding problem. Therefore, in addition to the amnesty measures of the Chinese government, those who have committed minor crimes will be temporarily pardoned, and parole will be adopted. Those who have committed crimes for the first time, whose cases are minor, who have behaved well in prison, and who have served more than two-thirds of their sentences will be selected for parole. However, if they are arrested again after being released from prison without reforming, the parole part will still be enforced according to the regulations.</p>
<h3>Handling of Mail After the Blockade of Ningbo and Wenzhou - Parcels to Eastern Zhejiang Suspended, Letters to be Forwarded</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army forcibly landed in Dinghai (Zhoushan), the situation in eastern Zhejiang has suddenly become tense. The Ningbo and Wenzhou Garrison Headquarters successively announced the blockade of the ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou in order to strengthen defense. Yesterday, it was learned from the Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration that, regarding parcels to various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the bureau, in view of the interruption of transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang and the difficulty of transportation, has suspended the acceptance and posting of large and small parcels to eastern Zhejiang since the day before yesterday. Once transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang is restored, they can be accepted and posted as usual. In addition, regarding ordinary registered express letters and other lightweight mail, the Transportation Division of the bureau is making every effort to find ways to forward them. Before receiving the notice from the Zhejiang Postal Administration (Lishui), remittance will remain as it is. As for Shantou mail, although it is still being accepted and posted as usual, according to the person in charge of the bureau, the notification telegram issued by the Shantou Postal Bureau is still on the way and is expected to be received within days. At that time, it can be decided whether to stop accepting it or not. However, parcels sent from Shanghai to Shantou have already been stopped.</p>
<h3>Cholera Discovered in Shanghai - Concession Actively Preventing and Controlling</h3>
<p>After the cholera epidemic in Shanghai last year, coupled with the depressing climate and the density of the population in the concession, cholera has occurred earlier than expected. However, it has not reached the level of an epidemic. In addition to paying attention and preventing it, the health authorities also hope that residents will be cautious about hygiene. In terms of prevention and control, the various branches of the health department have already started preventive injections. All epidemic hospitals have opened epidemic departments, such as the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road and the Zhenxin Hospital on Tianjin Road, all of which provide free medical treatment and have beds and ambulances.</p>
<h3>Air Mail Transportation in North China</h3>

<h3>Fake "Anti-Smoking Bureau" - Plans to Establish "Smoking Cessation Centers" - Poisoning and Disturbing the People - The People in the Chongqing Area Will Have No Peace</h3>
<p>After the "Anti-Smoking Bureau" organized by the Japanese puppets announced its "establishment", Yu Junqing presided over it and set up an office on the second floor of No. 2 Jiuyi on North Sichuan Road, Hongkou. It had increased the tobacco tax on various opium dens in western Shanghai, which was rejected by various opium dens. The puppet bureau arrested many opium den owners, causing a total work stoppage dispute in the opium dens. According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency, the puppet bureau is now planning to set up opium dens in Hongkou Xiangyanqiao, Qiujiang Road, and other places and has recruited people to undertake them. At the same time, in order to cover up the public sale of opium, it is falsely claiming to establish so-called "smoking cessation centers" and "anti-smuggling teams". After this puppet organization is realized, it will poison and disturb the people at the same time. The people in the occupied area of Chongqing will have no peace.</p>
<h3>Increased Overdue Fees for Large Domestic Parcels</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1554 states that, starting from today, the collection of overdue fees for large domestic parcels has been increased as follows: No overdue fee will be charged from the first to the fifth day after the recipient receives the parcel collection notice.

<h3>According to Clues - Arrested Bandits - Confiscated Firearms and Other Weapons</h3>
<p>Li Yidong, the Chinese detective of Yulin Road Police Station, Zhang Fuquan, the detective, and Li Hongsheng, the detective, learned that a gang of thieves was hiding at No. 4, Lane 266, Yanshan Road, Hongkou. They met with Western detective Huituo and secretly went to the address at noon on the 27th of last month to arrest Xu Wenlin (also known as Wang Si), Jiang Xueqi (also known as Wang Su), Lu Keming (also known as Sanhe), Ji Ruisheng, Chen Jinsheng, Chen Jinshun, Zhao Dongsheng, Lu Kexing, a woman named Lu Yan, Chen Zhao, and other ten people from Tongzhou. They found a hammer, a chisel, a screw, and other items. Then, they arrested Yin Jinshun, a Tongzhou native, on Pingliang Road and took him to the police station. He confessed that there were still accomplices and military supplies hidden at No. 21, Lane 230, Yanshan Road. The Chinese and Western detectives went to arrest Chen Xiaoqi, a Tongzhou native, and found a six-round pistol, six bullets, and a foreign knife under the blanket on the bed. They also learned that there were other military supplies hidden in Xu Wenlin's thatched shed on Hejian Road. The detectives went to the address and found another rusty pistol, brought it back to the police station, and detained them separately. A few days ago, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, the lawyer of the police station, gave a detailed account of the case and stated that the defendants had committed many armed robbery cases in the concession and that the police station had not yet completed the investigation. He requested permission to detain them. After hearing the brief questions of Xu Wenlin and others, the judge ordered that they be allowed to be detained and that they be interrogated again on July 8.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Heavily Pregnant - Firmly Requests Divorce - Husband Sues for Cohabitation on the Pretext of Returning Home - Wife Files Counterclaim, Awaiting Payment of Litigation Fees for Further Review</h3>
<p>Shao Chuzeng, a young man from Yuyao, married Sun Qiaoying, a woman from the same town. They soon turned against each other, and recently they have been suing each other in court. The marriage of the two was not originally the intention of the head of the family, but a match made. The fathers of the two had been partners in the paper business in this city, and the two families had been on good terms. Therefore, they took advantage of the good relationship between the families to further the marriage. On December 4 last year, they held a wedding at a restaurant on Fuzhou Road. Originally, the two had grown up</p>
<p>Side by Side</p>
<p>The love turned into hatred because the bride was not used to being discriminated against by her parents-in-law and sister-in-law, so she focused her frustration on the groom. Therefore, after the honeymoon, Qiaoying returned home on the pretext and took away her clothes and accessories. The Shao family pointed out that she had run away, and since then the two parties had turned from relatives into enemies. Although the two lived together for a short time, the wife was pregnant. Recently, her abdomen gradually bulged like a grave. The parents of both parties deeply felt that such a conflict was not a good solution. They also tried to find a solution many times, but Qiaoying firmly wanted a divorce, and Chuzeng demanded cohabitation.</p>
<p>Two Opposing Views</p>
<p>It was not possible for the mediators to be effective. Therefore, Shao Chuzeng filed a lawsuit against Sun Qiaoying in the First Special District Court for cohabitation. Sun Qiaoying also filed a counterclaim against Shao for divorce. Yesterday, Judge Gui Yu held a hearing and questioned them. First, Shao Chuzeng stated that he was 23 years old and submitted a marriage certificate, requesting that the defendant return home and fulfill her obligations of cohabitation as husband and wife. Then, Sun Qiaoying stated that she was 21 years old and immediately listed all the facts of the bad treatment by her parents-in-law and sister-in-law, especially</p>
<p>During the Honeymoon</p>
<p>Her parents-in-law refused to give her pillows and bedding, and even if she wanted copper coins to soak her feet later, she had to ask for them. What made her most unbearable was that she said she really couldn't stand all this pain and had to get a divorce. However, the court hoped that the two would not divorce, so it asked Shao whether she could live separately from her parents-in-law. Shao said that she only gets a monthly salary of 11 yuan now and that the couple's life still depends on their parents' support. There is no ability to form a separate family. At that time, Shao's agent lawyer Zhu suddenly raised the issue of Sun Qiaoying's pregnancy, claiming that Sun was so heavily pregnant and that she firmly stated that she was unwilling to live with her husband again. It was a sign of the defendant's inner self-disposal, so</p>
<p>The Pregnancy</p>
<p>Will still need to be examined in the future. Judge Gui considered that the lawyer's sudden statement was too much, as it aroused suspicion. He then asked Shao Chuzeng what attitude he had towards Sun's pregnancy. Shao said that he could not talk about this point now. Afterwards, Sun stated that she had been pregnant for seven months and that her lawyer defended the legal provisions of the pregnancy period. After the court clarified the marriage period and pregnancy period, Shao said that he no longer doubted it. As a result of the trial, the defendant was ordered to pay the counterclaim litigation fee, and the hearing was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Wusongkou - Strict Quarantine - All Ships Must Be Inspected</h3>
<p>Zi Lin Bao said that a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy revealed to reporters yesterday (1st) that, in view of the fact that ships may carry infectious diseases, stricter quarantine regulations are being implemented in Wusong, at the mouth of the Huangpu River. This stricter method began yesterday morning. The quarantine matters are being handled by the Jianghai Customs. Quarantine officers will stop all ships in Wusong and board them for inspection.</p>
<h3>Everything is Expensive, Life is Not Easy - Practice Thrift, Use National Products - The Buyiyi Association Encourages People from All Walks of Life to Practice it and Send Doctors and Medicines to Benefit the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>Recently, foreign exchange has been tight, raw materials have soared, and various industries have raised prices in order to avoid losing all their capital. There are unscrupulous merchants who take the opportunity to make profits and deliberately raise prices, so that ordinary residents feel the hardship of life. The only way to remedy this is to practice thrift and use national products in order to overcome all difficulties. Since the establishment of the Buyiyi Association in this city this spring, it has been dedicated to promoting national products and promoting thrift. Because its purpose is pure, celebrities in this city have unanimously supported it. Various national product manufacturers have also formulated discount methods for members of the association. Those who have participated successively include the Commercial Press, the Zhonghua Book Company, the World Book Company, the Wuhe Weaving Factory, the China Underwear Company, the China Chemical Industry Society, the Family Industry Society, the Brothers Store, the Wuzhou Drug Store, and the Zhongxi Drug Store. The association is now stepping up its efforts to encourage the Chinese people to practice thrift, use national products, and welcome people from all walks of life to join the association in order to practice it and overcome the difficulties of the war. It is also learned that the association is actively preparing for the summer health campaign, organizing medical consultations and medicine distribution, hiring more than 20 famous Chinese and Western doctors to preside over it, and specially contracting several national drug stores and Western drug stores to distribute medicines in order to serve the general public. The details will be announced in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Husband Loses Job - Stabs Wife to Death - Police Strictly Pursue the Murderer for Extortion Dispute</h3>
<p>On the south end of Laifeide Road, Caishi Road, French Concession, outside the back door of No. 37, Shuxiang Lane, a husband stabbed his wife, Miss Dan, to death. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the deceased, Miss Lu Da, was 25 years old, from Nantong, and lived with her husband, Zhou Sima Pi, on the first floor of No. 136, Laoshenfu Road. She worked as a female worker at the Yumin Egg Factory at the intersection of Kangding Road and Malang Road. Her husband, Zhou Sima Pi, was about 30 years old. He used to be a cook but is now unemployed and depends on his wife for a living. On the first day, at 7 p.m., Lu went to the Shuxiang Lane 37, Caishi Road, to talk to Xu Lu, an old woman from the same town, on the platform room on the third floor. Zhou also followed her and asked her for 6 yuan, but she refused. The couple quarreled. Xu tried to send them away. The couple went home together. As soon as they left the back door, Zhou took out a sharp knife and stabbed her arm. Because it was a vital part, she fell to the ground and died. Zhou saw that he had caused a major disaster and fled. Residents of Shuxiang Lane reported it to the police station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. On one hand, they moved the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy and took the witness, Xu Lu, an old woman, for interrogation. They will report to the court today to send someone to inspect the body. It is heard that the deceased has no relatives in Shanghai other than her husband, who is on the run. The police station has sent detectives to search for the fugitive murderer and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Thugs Steal Money - Six Criminals Sentenced to Collection Separately</h3>
<p>Li Laoer, a native of Huzhou, lives at a certain number on Wuding Road and sells used goods. At 11:15 p.m. on June 29, he went out from his home and walked to the entrance of Lane 1 on Hede Road. He happened to meet a woman surnamed Wang who was chatting. Unexpectedly, a group of hooligans, including Li De and Wang Shaoshan from Anhui, Huang Jianyuan, Liu Yunhong, Le Bangyue, and Wen Daoquan, saw it and thought that Li had improper behavior with the woman. They rushed forward and forced him into a small teahouse nearby, stealing 6 yuan of legal currency on the pretext and fleeing separately. Li Laoer knew that Li De lived at No. 90, Xinzha Road, so he reported the information to the Gedeng Road Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Pi Shaozhang and detective Li Zhaoyuan to secretly arrest Li first, and then to continue to arrest Wang Shaoshan and five others at No. 13 on the same road, and took them to the police station together. The other day, they were sent to the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, sentenced Wen Daoquan to three months of imprisonment for robbery. Li De, Wang Shaoshan, Huang Jianyuan, Liu Yunhong, and Le Bangyue were each sentenced to one month to show them as a warning.</p>
<h3>Qingyuli Dispute Resolved - Extension of Relocation</h3>
<p>The relocation dispute in Yuqing Lane, Xin Chongqing Road, this city, occurred in April of this year and has lasted for three months. The Women's Bank, based on contractual relationship, and the matter has been submitted to the court for a relocation judgment, which is bound to be implemented. However, more than 3,000 tenants in the entire lane are in this extraordinary period, with an oversupply of population and housing in Shanghai, making it difficult to find another place to live. The law is not beyond human affection. The public groups have repeatedly asked to uphold justice and sued the court for exemption from execution. The Ministry of Justice and Administration has also approved the matter for careful handling. Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng and other mediators have also mediated many times. It is learned that the Women's Bank and the tenants have room to find a place to live during this period, and the Women's Bank will demolish and build new buildings according to the original plan.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain in This City Yesterday - Roads Flooded into Ditches - Pedestrians Must Use Vehicles for Ferry</h3>
<p>Since the night before yesterday, it has been raining all night. Yesterday, from dawn to noon, heavy rain poured down and did not stop for a while, causing the roads to be flooded into ditches, especially in front of the Xianshi and Yong'an companies on Nanjing Road, which became a small river with a depth of more than half a foot. The depth of the water on Zhejiang Road on the north side of Nanjing Road and Yinghua Street on the south side was also three or four inches. Vehicles passed by, splashing waves everywhere, which was caused by the insufficient drainage of the sewers. At that time, pedestrians had to wade through the water with their ankles, or they had to be ferried by rickshaws. In addition, the roads in the French Concession, such as Sapposai Road, Ximen Road, and Maisaerti Road, and the west side of the Extreme Sifeier Road, Difeng Road, and Yanping Road, were also flooded to the point where the water was almost up to the shins. General rickshaw drivers temporarily ferried pedestrians, making a profit ten times over.</p>
<h3>Suicide Cases Also Recorded</h3>
<p>A boy, Guan Ahui, was 15 years old and lived at No. 1, Lane 164, Qipu Road. Yesterday morning at around 6 o'clock, he did not know what stimulation he had received, but he secretly took poison and committed suicide. After being discovered, he was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is heard that he took a lot of poison and his life is in danger.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:32, a woman, about 30 years old, at No. 841, Avenue Edward VII, suddenly set herself on fire. After being discovered by her family, she was dying and unconscious. She was immediately summoned by an ambulance and rushed to Guangren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fan Cheng, 26 years old, committed suicide by throwing herself into the Suzhou River on Yichang Road yesterday morning at around 11 o'clock due to economic pressure. She was later seen by nearby Chinese police and rescued. Because she swallowed too much water, she was unconscious and rushed to Guangren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Li Huiwen, a 16-year-old girl from Changshu, lives at No. 25, Shantou Road, Public Concession, and studies at Daozhong Girls' Middle School. As a rule, she goes home at 4 p.m. every day. Yesterday, after school, Li went shopping with her classmates. It was not until 6 p.m. that she returned home and was slightly criticized by her father.

<h3>Young Woman Lured and Raped - Then Sold as a Prostitute - Then Extorted Money from Her Husband - Reported to the Police and Arrested Various Criminals Detained Separately Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Sun Bing, the 21-year-old wife of Liu Yaocai from Danyang, who resides at No. 27, Anyi Village, North Xizang Road, was lured out by her fellow villager Chen Jigen between June 14 and was raped overnight in a small inn on Minguo Road, French Concession. The next morning, he went to the Guan room of the Zhongnan Hotel on Xizang Road, Public Concession, and invited his fellow villager Liu Muhai to come, intending to sell her to someone, but there were no customers. That night, Chen and Liu</p>
<p>Slept and Took Turns Raping</p>
<p>Later, he found Changzhou Zhong and sold her to a brothel opened by Zhao Guannian, a woman from Yangzhou, at No. 40, Xiamen Road, to be a prostitute, forcing her to receive customers. A few days later, Chen Jigen went to Liu Yaocai's home, falsely claiming that he had taken his wife to find her and had found a job, but he had to pay 150 yuan to get her back. Liu then knew that his wife</p>
<p>Was Lured Away</p>
<p>As a result, he agreed to give 70 yuan and secretly reported to the Huishi Police Station. Chinese detective Shen Dehui rushed to arrest Chen, who confessed the location of the woman. Then, Liu Muhai was arrested. They went to No. 40, Xiamen Road, and found Liu Sun, together with</p>
<p>A Woman from the Brothel</p>

Chen Jigen, Shi Yingen, Liu Muhai, and Zhao Guannian, the madam, were still detained separately, awaiting sentencing. After investigating Chen Jinhai, the police station found that he was not involved and allowed him to be released.</p>

<p>Yu Haisheng, a 25-year-old native of Pudong and owner of the "Good Fortune and Abundance" confectionery store at No. 1433, Yu Road, previously borrowed several thousand yuan from his aunt. Unable to repay the debt, on August 21st of last year, he devised a plan to lure Bao Jiang to Room 627 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, where he strangled her to death and fled. On October 4th of the same year, he was arrested at the Wuxi Hostel on Hankou Road by the police and brought before the First Special Court. After interrogation, Yu Haisheng was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, with permanent deprivation of his civil rights. Yu contested the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Yu remained dissatisfied and hired lawyer Yu Enliang to file an appeal with the Supreme Court. After reviewing the case, the Supreme Court ordered a new trial by the Second Branch of the High Court. Presiding Judge Yu held multiple hearings and, upon concluding the investigation, deemed the evidence conclusive. Yesterday, the First Criminal Division of the court convened to pronounce the verdict in the presence of the accused Yu: "Ruling: Appeal dismissed."</p>

He was subsequently brought before the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court and prosecuted on charges of battery. During the trial, Presiding Judge Huang heard testimony from the plaintiff, the victim, detailing the circumstances of the assault. When questioned, the defendant Chen Guochang admitted to the assault, stating that his wife had been disrespectful to his parents and he was merely disciplining her.

Now, after half a year, the current President Yang Qi has ordered judges Sun and Liao to return to their original positions, officially resuming their duties today. Furthermore, because the workload in the Civil Preliminary Court and Criminal Preliminary Court is heavy, President Yang requested that the Third Branch of the High Court dispatch two additional judges to assist.

<p>Qi Linsheng, a 55-year-old doctor of traditional Chinese medicine from Shangcheng, Henan, residing at No. 10, Yongyuli, intersection of Lafayete Road and Beile Road, was recently accused in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court by Chen Wang, a woman from Suzhou residing at No. 1, Wufengli, intersection of Xavia Road and Luban Road, through her lawyer Hu Yongsheng, of enticing her daughter Chen Sannan and hiding her in the pavilion room of Wang Yongquan's home at No. 522 Beile Road for illicit sexual relations. Qi also hired a lawyer to defend him. Presiding Judge Liao Yuan held multiple hearings, summoning witnesses Wang Yongquan and Zhang Shucheng for questioning. He then announced the conclusion of the debate, originally scheduled for a verdict on the 30th of last month, as previously reported in this newspaper. However, when the presiding judge reviewed the case files and drafted the judgment, he found certain points still unclear and requiring further investigation to ensure justice was served. Therefore, the conclusion of the debate was revoked on the 30th and a new debate was scheduled. This case has now been taken over by Judge Sun Penghan. Further testimony will be required for review and debate, at which time the lawyers for both sides will undoubtedly engage in vigorous argumentation.</p>

<p>Meeting Scheduled for 9:30 AM This Morning; Another Shooting Incident Yesterday</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Police Station of the Public Concession, in view of the frequent presence of unlawful individuals in the border area of West Shanghai, has specially deployed Chinese and foreign detectives to patrol the area at all times for the sake of public order. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 3:40 PM, West Inspector No. 83 of the police station, along with Chinese police officers No. 2364, No. 2564, and No. 2989, were patrolling near the illegal extensions of Zhuanbang on Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai. They noticed seven or eight suspicious men dressed in various styles of plain clothes loitering within the concession, behaving strangely. They approached the men to question them and intended to search them. However, upon seeing the detectives approach, the men pulled out firearms and opened fire to resist the search. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, the Chinese and foreign detectives returned fire while immediately telegraphing the Jing'an Temple Police Station to dispatch a large number of detectives on police vehicles to suppress the situation. Within moments, the detectives gathered, and the plainclothes men, seeing the situation, fled towards Zhuanbang. In the end, more than ten shots were fired, and neither side suffered any injuries. However, the police department, considering this situation to be of concern for public order, has specially scheduled a meeting with the commander of the Japanese military in the area at 9:30 AM this morning to discuss solutions.

<h3>Local Education in Zhejiang: Past Conditions and Improvements (1) Cultivating and Training Teachers, Improving Teacher Salaries</h3>
<p>(Fangyan Correspondence) Local education is the foundation of all education and the starting point for all educational endeavors. The cultural level of a province or county is always judged by the quality of local education. The smooth implementation of political policies is also closely related to the progress of local education. Although Zhejiang Province has been continuously striving to promote improvements in recent years, it still falls short of meeting the current urgent needs. The key problems are the lack of teachers in quantity and poor quality, as well as the shortage of funding and the imperfection of administrative mechanisms, which are the biggest reasons. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, aware of this, presented the past conditions of local education and the key points for future improvement to the first meeting of the Provincial Assembly for discussion. The original text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>A. Past Conditions</p>
<p>1. Regarding the teaching staff in primary schools in various counties, the total number of primary school teachers in the 26th year of the Republic was 29,621. Among them, 40% were primary school graduates. Less than 20% had received normal school education. The rest were students who graduated or dropped out from middle schools or vocational schools. With such a quality of teachers, it is difficult to improve the level of basic education and promote the spirit of the nation. To remedy this deficiency, we must actively cultivate teachers on one hand, and train existing teachers on the other. Training existing teachers includes holding short-term intensive training courses for primary school teachers, establishing teacher training institutions, and conducting qualification examinations to improve their knowledge and skills, so that they can directly benefit students' learning. As for cultivating teachers, based on the existing 14 schools with 83 classes, only over 300 students graduate each year, which is far from enough to replace the unqualified teachers. Furthermore, if we want to implement universal education and establish more short-term primary schools and wartime civilian schools, the need for teachers will be even greater. According to the statistics of the recent two years, there are still over 1.2 million children who are out of school and over 3.3 million adults who are out of school. Assuming that each primary school teacher teaches an average of 30 children, we need to train 40,000 teachers. Assuming that each civilian school teacher teaches an average of 32 adults, we need to train over 103,000 teachers. The total is over 143,000 teachers. Cultivating such a large number of teachers is definitely beyond the current financial capacity of Zhejiang Province. However, the qualitative improvement and quantitative expansion of teachers still need to be gradually addressed to develop local education.</p>
<p>2. Although we are doing our best to cultivate and train teachers, if their salaries cannot be improved, then the cultivation and training will be in vain. Since the outbreak of the war, primary school teachers with higher qualifications and academic abilities have mostly been absorbed by other institutions with better salaries. It is found that nearly half of the trainees in various training teams and classes are former primary school teachers, creating an unprecedented crisis in the primary school education sector in this province. It is found that the salaries of primary school teachers in this province are as low as two or three yuan per month. Even the salaries of teachers in county-run primary schools, which are the highest, average only over 17 yuan per month, which is not enough to maintain personal life, let alone support a family. The fact that local education in various counties can still be maintained is due to the reliance on young men who have received some education but are not qualified. In the future, the level of local education will gradually decline, which goes without saying. Therefore, improving the salaries of primary school teachers is an urgent matter for developing local education.</p>
<p>3. The failure to improve the salaries of primary school teachers and the failure to improve school facilities in the past are due to the lack of funding for local education. It is found that the main source of education funding in various counties is the 40% surtax on land tax and the 10% surtax, as well as slaughter tax, deed tax, property tax, school property rent, school fees, etc. A county education fund management committee is established to manage them to ensure the independence of education funding. However, since the change from the special fund system to the unified revenue and expenditure system, the independence of education funding has lost its guarantee, and the county education funding has declined year by year. In the 25th year of the Republic, county education funding accounted for less than 23% of the total local funding, in the 26th year of the Republic it accounted for slightly over 17%, and in the 27th year of the Republic it dropped to less than 11%. What is even worse is that, compared with the budget and final account of the county education funding in the 26th year of the Republic, an average of 29% of the funds that should have been spent were not spent. The only thing that maintains the poorly paid teachers and the poorly equipped schools is the education funding, but there are also cases of arrears and misappropriation, which is really hateful. Therefore, the county education funding should have a prescribed standard, guarantee its independence, and plan to increase it to develop local education.</p>

<h3>Academia Sinica Solicits Prize-Winning Papers: In Memory of Yang Quan and Ding Wenjiang, Deadline End of January Next Year</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail News) The Academia Sinica is offering a Yang Quan Prize and a Ding Wenjiang Prize in memory of the late Secretary-General Yang Quan and Ding Wenjiang. Each prize is worth 2,000 yuan. Last year, the Ding Wenjiang Prize was awarded by the council of the academy to Mr. Wu Dayou for his greatest contributions to physics.

<h3>Comments on the System of Using "Interbank Transfer Certificates"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>After the Reintroduction of Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals</p>
<p>Starting June 22nd, the Ministry of Finance once again restricted withdrawals. Only 500 yuan in cash can be withdrawn per week; amounts exceeding this can be paid with transfer vouchers. Transfer vouchers cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange and cannot be used outside of Shanghai; although there is an illegal discounting market, the discount rate is quite high. Therefore, after the implementation of this order, two major phenomena occurred in the Shanghai financial market:</p>
<p>(1) There is a large shortage of legal tender in circulation, and all new cash transactions are severely restricted, so the frenzied speculative market suddenly cools down; speculative prices that were soaring have uniformly plummeted.</p>
<p>(2) Due to the lack of legal tender and the renewed emphasis on the transfer system, transfer discounting speculation, which had been suppressed, has resurfaced, and is even more intense than before.</p>
<p>The purpose of restricting withdrawals and deposits was originally to prevent capital flight and stabilize wartime finance. Judging from the first phenomenon, its mission has been clearly accomplished.</p>
<p>However, since transfers can be discounted, the gateway for capital flight has clearly not been completely closed. The surge in the discount rate can reduce the gateway for capital leakage, but the effect is minimal; however, its impact on prices and the livelihood of ordinary people is significant. Transfer vouchers cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange, which is certainly the greatest advantage; but at the same time, they cannot be used to purchase local goods in the interior, which cannot but be said to be a major flaw in the midst of perfection. Therefore, opinions on the current transfer system vary; consequently, there are also conflicting views on illegal transfer discounts. There is good reason for this!</p>
<p>Supplementary Measures and Supplementary Currency</p>
<p>In order to take care of domestic trade, in addition to restricting cash deposits of 500 yuan, it is necessary to open up another financing opportunity; and this financing opportunity must not be utilized by those fleeing capital. The current transfer discounting is certainly a financing method, but it subjects both legitimate commercial needs and capital flight to the same high discount rates, and still cannot prevent capital flight, but instead allows the transfer of transfer discounts to the local product market, causing price increases and even affecting its transactions and exports. Therefore, the ideal financing method should at least have the following characteristics: directly, it cannot purchase foreign exchange, and indirectly, it cannot purchase foreign exchange; domestically, although it does not go through the process of being exchanged into legal tender, it can still be used to purchase local products everywhere, and is not limited to Shanghai. Therefore, in addition to legal tender and transfer vouchers, a new currency that meets these principles should be established. However, this new currency must not disrupt the supply and demand relationship of the entire currency market, nor damage the integrity of the legal tender system as a basic condition. Therefore, after its issuance, it should have the function of contracting legal tender; otherwise, there is a crisis of inflation. However, it should only be limited to contracting the amount of legal tender in circulation, and absolutely not usurp the position and prestige of legal tender in the circulation sector; otherwise, it would be aiding a tyrant and would suffer a disastrous end.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, the Shanghai Bankers' and Money Dealers' Association has now decided to advocate the establishment of a system for using "Interbank Transfer Certificates" in order to remedy the disadvantages to domestic trade after the current restriction on cash deposits, and to eliminate the various drawbacks that current transfer discounting gives to prices and creditors. It is said that this "Transfer Certificate" is issued through the joint cooperation of Chinese and foreign bankers and money dealers, and is scheduled to be implemented starting tomorrow. Let us first look at its content.</p>
<p>(1) Each bank and firm shall submit (1) major goods, (2) company bonds and stocks with official market prices in the Shanghai market, and (3) real estate with rights and interests within the Shanghai Concession to the Joint Reserve as collateral; and receive 70% of the evaluated value of the collateral in "Interbank Transfer Certificates."</p>
<p>(2) All transfers between banks and firms shall be paid with "Interbank Transfer Certificates." Transfer accounts of banks and firms shall use special checkbooks issued by the Joint Reserve.</p>
<p>(3) "Interbank Transfer Certificates" may be transferred to the interior for the purpose of purchasing local goods. Although the regulations do not state "cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange" and "cannot be discounted into legal tender," in fact, of course, they cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange and cannot be discounted into legal tender.</p>
<p>(4) "Interbank Transfer Certificates" have a maximum issuance amount of 70% of the evaluated value of the collateral; when the value of the collateral falls, it must be replenished. One representative each from the Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Bankers' Association, and the Bankers' and Money Dealers' Association; and one representative jointly dispatched by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, shall jointly form an "Issuance Reserve Inspection Committee" to inspect at least once a month.</p>
<p>(5) The interest rate for using transfer certificates and the interest rate for transfer deposits shall be publicly set by the Joint Reserve daily; each bank and firm shall settle interest on transfer deposits and debts once a month; when necessary, the Joint Reserve may inspect the deposit situation of each bank and firm.</p>
<p>This content is obtained from the analysis of the two types of regulations reported: the usage method and the inspection method. Are there any other issuance regulations? It is not known. In our opinion, in order to avoid disrupting the currency system, it is not necessary to have issuance regulations, but the performance of the "Transfer Certificate" should be clearly stipulated in writing.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of "Interbank Transfer Certificates"</p>
<p>As shown in the above content, the "Interbank Transfer Certificate" seems to have the same characteristics as the German "Blocked Mark," both of which can be used domestically but cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange. The difference is that the "Blocked Mark" can be used as the final payment domestically, while the "Transfer Certificate" only serves as a means of offsetting debts and credits between the two parties and as a certificate for "transferring accounts." At the same time, the "Transfer Certificate" has a definite reserve and is jointly issued by the private financial sector, so it does not have the characteristics of legal tender and is healthier than the unreserved "Blocked Mark."</p>
<p>The reserve is definite and jointly issued by the banking and money-dealing industries, so it is the same as the "bank official receipt" with the nature of "wealth certificate", and is by no means the so-called "circulating note" of non-redeemable paper money. The difference is that bank official receipts can be exchanged for legal tender; even if they are not exchanged, they can be used for final payment in clearing. This can only be used for the acceptance and transfer of transfers between the same industry and as a certificate of "transferring accounts", and cannot be cashed. Therefore, it has the same nature as transfer vouchers.</p>
<p>Transfer vouchers cannot be used outside of Shanghai, otherwise they will require a premium; this can be transferred to the interior to purchase local goods without requiring a premium; the credit of transfer vouchers is guaranteed by individuals, while this is jointly guaranteed by the banking and money-dealing industries. Once transfer vouchers are discounted, they can be used to purchase foreign exchange; this cannot be discounted, so it cannot indirectly escape its funds. Therefore, it is far superior to transfer vouchers!</p>
<p>In terms of its ability to purchase local goods anywhere in the country, it is completely different from legal tender. However, legal tender can be used to purchase foreign exchange, while this cannot.</p>
<p>If the characteristics of "transfer certificates" are indeed like this, then it is truly an ideal type of blocked currency. After the implementation of this certificate, the following four good effects can be obtained:</p>
<p>(1) On the other hand, with the universality of this certificate, the need for legal tender in the domestic circulation sector can be eliminated invisibly. With the reduction of legal tender in the circulation sector, speculative trends such as fleeing funds and foreign exchange cash can be suppressed.</p>
<p>(2) After this certificate is transferred and exchanged, it can be used to purchase local goods in the interior, which can allow Shanghai's funds to flow into the interior on a large scale; and on a small scale, it can invisibly maintain the balance of Shanghai's trade with the interior.</p>
<p>(3) While the circulation of transfer certificates increases, the amount of current transfer vouchers used will decrease in inverse proportion. Transfer discounting speculation can be eliminated.</p>
<p>(4) The transfer certificate is at par with legal tender, and the amount of issuance is limited by the amount of reserves and the guarantee ratio for use, so there is no risk of inflation; prices will not be affected.</p>
<p>The purpose of wartime financial policy is nothing more than to prevent capital flight and adjust the use of funds. Therefore, we should unanimously support, jointly promote, and earnestly implement this transfer certificate system advocated by the local financial authorities. And before implementation, we should each contribute constructive suggestions to make it a perfect system.</p>
<p>Shortcomings That Must Be Improved</p>
<p>If interbank transfer certificates are indeed as described above, they can be called an ideal system. However, there are still areas that should be studied in terms of the technology of issuance, use, and promotion:</p>
<p>(1) The performance of the transfer certificate still lacks complete and clear written regulations. Words such as "cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange" and "cannot be discounted" should be clearly listed to avoid doubts and open the door to abuses.</p>
<p>(2) Legal tender and public bonds should be added to the collateral. Because there is absolutely no reason to exclude the two types of wealth, legal tender and public bonds, from the scope of collateral. The fact that they are not listed now is truly unfathomable! If legal tender is listed as one of the collateral, and its statutory ratio to be paid is stipulated, then the effect of contracting the circulation of legal tender will be further emphasized. If it is feared that the legal tender holdings of each bank and firm will be too short, hindering their legitimate maneuvering; then it is not necessary to stipulate the ratio to be paid. If, after freely using legal tender as collateral, no one will use legal tender as collateral again. In fact, even if no one provides it, there is still a need to list it. Otherwise, it will be enough to breed doubts. If the "international currency" and "trade currency" advocated by the Japanese, etc., we must avoid being mixed up with it. Since the collateral is evaluated at any time, there is no inconvenience in listing public bonds and listing corporate bonds and stocks. If public bonds are excluded and legal tender is excluded, then the future status of transfer certificates in the Chinese circulation sector, and its status as a merit or crime in the Chinese currency market, will be determined by this shortcoming today, it can be asserted.</p>
<p>(3) The issuance of transfer certificates can obtain the cooperation of foreign banks, which is due to their support for the Chinese legal tender system, their sympathy for maintaining Shanghai's finances, and the necessity of maintaining their own commercial interests in China. In addition, it must be the point that this certificate can be used to purchase local products in the interior. This performance will also be a strong guarantee that transfer certificates will not be discounted. But the so-called interior should be divided into two types: the occupied areas and the non-occupied areas. If this system is a supplementary currency to legal tender, and it does have the various characteristics mentioned above; then it can naturally be used unconditionally in non-occupied areas. But there are problems in the occupied areas. If these problems cannot be solved, and the purchase of goods in the occupied areas is stopped fundamentally; it can also have the effect of crushing the Japanese scheme to monopolize the products of the occupied areas. If these problems cannot be solved, and the purchase of goods in the occupied areas continues, then the issuance of this certificate is tantamount to sealing up the cash in Shanghai, exclusively for the purpose of purchasing goods in the occupied areas; as for the non-occupied areas, this certificate is used purely for acceptance and transfer, and no cash is used. Then the result of the implementation of this certificate must be contrary to its purpose of issuance! It must be carried out with particular caution and prudence!</p>
<h3>Commentary on the New Exchange Allocation System and Other Matters</h3>
<p>— Xie Juzeng</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to Shanghai restricting each depositor in banks and money shops to withdrawing only 500 法幣 (legal tender) per week, with any excess amounts to be settled through exchange allocation and only allowing bank and money shop transfers to prevent capital flight, the Shanghai financial market has immediately taken on a new look following the seven supplementary measures discussed and agreed upon by the Banking and Money Shop Associations and approved by the Ministry of Finance. When this new method of stabilizing finance was first announced, all sectors were inevitably somewhat alarmed, but after the earnest explanations of industry leaders, calm soon prevailed. However, there were still many misunderstandings in some quarters, so I will not hesitate to address these in detail to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>First, although this method of restricting withdrawals and deposits is similar to the method of stabilizing finance during the August 13th Incident, the motivations are completely different. The method during the August 13th Incident was initiated by the financial sector and approved by the financial authorities, with the aim of preventing the expansion of deposit withdrawal panics and affecting the reserves of banks and money shops. This new restriction, however, is in compliance with a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, completely initiated by the financial authorities, with the financial sector having no prior knowledge. Therefore, several financial giants convened a meeting at 2:00 AM after receiving the telegram, demonstrating the urgency of the matter. Needless to say, the purpose of this move is to consolidate the foreign exchange stabilization fund and prevent speculation in 法幣, so it was implemented with the same swiftness as the cessation of foreign exchange supply at a rate of 8.25 per dollar on June 7th. However, some people outside mistakenly believe that this is a stopgap measure by the financial sector to deal with deposit withdrawals, especially Western newspapers, which believe that the Ministry of Finance's telegram greatly helps the deposit withdrawal panic of Chinese banks, otherwise they would not be able to cope. In fact, the opposite is true, because most banks and money shops in Shanghai currently feel that they have excess capital. After the exchange rate market changed on June 7th, although many depositors withdrew 法幣 to purchase foreign exchange or engage in other speculations, the banks and money shops themselves did not feel threatened by withdrawals. However, from the perspective of the overall national policy, this distressing phenomenon should not be allowed to continue. Therefore, they immediately complied with the Ministry of Finance's telegram. Although they knew that it would inevitably cause misunderstandings among a few short-sighted depositors and feared that foreign banks would take the opportunity to absorb deposits, creating a situation of "driving fish into deep waters", they chose the lesser of two evils and could not consider everything.</p>
<p>Second, some people advocate that Shanghai should be transformed into a transfer-only port in the future. This principle is worth supporting, although whether it can be smoothly realized and how to promote its realization are separate issues. However, to think that the goal can be achieved simply by stamping "transfer only" on exchange allocation bills seems too simplistic! Exchange allocation bills after the August 13th Incident were originally transfer-only bills and could not be cashed, as clearly stipulated in the method of stabilizing finance. Moreover, the exchange allocation bills issued by banks are almost all fund transfer orders from the "Three Banks." The bills clearly have two horizontal lines printed on them, which is a clear indication that they are only for bank and money shop transfers. However, those who only care about personal gain and ignore the greater good—in fact, take risks—even dare to discount parallel-lined bills, so simply stamping the words "transfer only" is still ineffective!</p>
<p>Third, some people lament that since the exchange allocation system is being implemented and withdrawals of 法幣 are restricted, there should be no more discounting, otherwise the exchange allocation can still be exchanged for 法幣, and the result is the same as zero. I also share this feeling. If the financial authorities and the financial industry are determined, it will not be difficult to stop discounting. First, the bank and money shop's own customers must always pay with exchange allocation for those who deposit exchange allocation, and those who deposit 法幣 must not convert it into exchange allocation. Most member banks and money shops can consistently adhere to this. Second, exchange allocation bills, especially parallel-lined bills, cannot be discounted. Small money shops and silver shops that solicit business rashly will not be protected by law. (The Negotiable Instruments Law is sufficient to apply and does not require separate provisions.) After one or two lawsuits and suffering one or two major losses, everyone will naturally know where to stop. If you want to cut off the source of the problem, all shops that engage in discounting must ultimately pay the bills they receive to member banks and money shops for collection. If they agree or are ordered not to deal with them at that time, it will be enough to put them to death. Moreover, member banks and money shops have a significant responsibility to protect themselves and should not rashly accept parallel-lined bills of unknown origin.</p>
<p>Fourth, the new 50 million 法幣 exchange allocation implemented by the banking industry on July 4th is specially authorized by the Shanghai Banking and Money Shop Association to the Joint Reserve Committee to cope with the current environment. It has nothing to do with the financial authorities, let alone the illusory circulating notes. Second, although the new exchange allocation is set at 50 million 法幣, it does not mean that so much capital is added at once. It is flexible and adjusts according to the amount needed at any time. Banks and money shops issue checks daily for the balance of the new exchange allocation exchange, which is transferred by the exchange. According to our estimates, the capital of the new exchange allocation will not exceed 20 million 法幣 in the next few months.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the new exchange allocation are worth praising. Originally, the head offices of exchange allocation were not welcomed by the Bund banks because it was an abstract capital. The new exchange allocation is different. Its receipt must be based on real estate with the right to profit in the concession, company bonds and stocks with market value, and major commodities, after strict evaluation and then discounted as collateral. Therefore, it is a capital with definite preparation, and its preparation is no less than 法幣. In addition, representatives of foreign banks participated in it – in fact, the custodian committee and evaluation committee of the preparation committee were managed by the managers and experts of HSBC and Mercantile Bank – so there should be no problem with circulation among the Bund banks in the future. And the people of the country who own the new exchange allocation deposits have such solid guarantees, so they don’t need to worry about exchanging them for 法幣, or buying foreign exchange! As for the new exchange allocation being able to be remitted to the mainland as 法幣, the old exchange allocation is also superior, (because the capital from the mainland is remitted to Shanghai with a large exchange rate, so the exchange allocation funds are remitted to the mainland to receive 法幣, sometimes with a premium.) It is not enough to show the characteristics of the new exchange allocation.</p>
<h3>Review and Outlook of the Sino-Japanese Currency War (Conclusion)</h3>
<p>— Anshi</p>
<p>Theory of Establishing a Gold-Based Currency</p>
<p>Since the revival of silver currency is impossible, and the new currency must be convertible to foreign exchange in order to resist 法幣, there is the proposal to establish a new 余 (Yu) currency. The method is to cooperate with countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, jointly contribute funds, establish a reserve, and issue foreign currencies denominated in British and American currencies to circulate in Central China, so that 法幣 can be easily defeated.</p>
<p>This is indeed a method, but in reality, it is absolutely impossible to realize.</p>
<p>First, if the reserve is centered on and dominated by Japanese forces, foreigners will never participate, because this would only be used by the Japanese side and endanger their own economic power; conversely, if it is centered on the United Kingdom and the United States, the financial power of Central China will be completely in the hands of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the Japanese financial power will be exhausted. Why would Japan launch this Sino-Japanese war at the cost of sacrifice?</p>
<p>Second, leaving aside international principles and morality, if the United Kingdom and the United States help the Japanese to defeat 法幣, it will inevitably endanger the future of China's resistance and further endanger its entire economic power in China. British and American financiers are not all blind, even if the Japanese are willing to lure them with the benefits of Central China, they will never abandon the big for the small and destroy themselves.</p>
<p>Establishment of New Banks and Issuance of New Currencies</p>
<p>With all roads blocked, and finally unable to do anything, it was decided to establish new banks and issue new currencies. This is the Huaxing Bank and the Huaxing 券 (coupon). This publication has already discussed Huaxing in detail, so I will not repeat it. However, we cannot forget that the poor only want to get rich, and the Japanese have always wanted to replace 法幣 with Huaxing 券 and use the 法幣 obtained to buy foreign exchange. If this were successful, China's 法幣 would be defeated and victory would ultimately belong to the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Therefore, with a thunderous sound, the sale of foreign exchange on the black market in Shanghai was stopped, and the Japanese "new currency formulation policy" was shattered without leaving a trace. This move, in the end, in the Sino-Japanese currency war, made China win a great victory and Japan suffered another defeat. Because of this fatal blow, Huaxing 券 will inevitably fall into hell in the near future!</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese currency war, China has always been in the upper hand, calmly responding to the war, while Japan has been defeated in every battle. Now, it has suffered a fatal blow due to the suspension of the sale of foreign exchange on the black market in Shanghai. People without economic knowledge may think that this is because China's 法幣 has depreciated because it cannot buy foreign exchange, but this is only a one-sided view. At present, 法幣, Huaxing 券, and Japanese currency in Shanghai have all become unable to buy foreign exchange, but the foundation of 法幣 is extremely solid. Not only is there no tendency to expand in Shanghai, but there is a phenomenon of contraction. The circulation of division lines as currency is one proof of this. On the contrary, Japanese currency and its certain types of banknotes are undergoing extremely malignant expansion. In contrast, the value of 法幣 is much higher.</p>
<h3>A Word on the Issuance of Exchange Allocation to Fellow Traders</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a move in the financial sector to issue exchange allocation to fellow traders. The details of the method are seen in the newspaper. It is generally planned that all banks and shops can provide collateral and apply to a financial institution for the issuance of exchange allocation to fellow traders. The total amount is temporarily set at 50 million yuan. This method can increase capital and adjust finance. In principle, there is nothing wrong with it, but if the implementation is not careful, the result may be contrary to the intention of the Ministry of Finance's telegram. The reason why the Ministry of Finance's telegram alone restricts deposits in Shanghai twice is:</p>
<p>(1) Tighten the currency to reduce capital flight and seek to stabilize the foreign exchange black market more easily.</p>
<p>(2) At the same time, make prices fall to a considerable level and stabilize society.</p>
<p>Our financial sector should understand this intention and implement it conscientiously. Regarding the aspect of loan pledges for goods: We should especially tighten up. The issuance of exchange allocation to fellow traders is a little loose and indiscriminate, which will inevitably lead to ample funds and promote speculation. Prices will rise again, forming a completely opposite direction to the intention of the Ministry of Finance's telegram. Now that Shanghai's customs tax revenue is no longer ours, it is not a question of feeding wolves with blood and flesh for the financial sector to promote a small number of exchange allocations to fellow traders to adjust legitimate industrial and commercial industries?</p>
<h3>On the Suggestion of Turning Shanghai into a Transfer Port</h3>
<p>— Pan Chuandong</p>
<p>Some people advocate turning Shanghai into a transfer port in Shanghai to facilitate turnover. The intention is to improve the current exchange allocation system and turn exchange allocation into a checkbook note that cannot be discounted. However, we believe that there are two difficulties:</p>
<p>First, it is still impossible to solve the trade with foreign merchants. Therefore, this transfer note may not be able to (actually cannot) have the function of cutting heads; there is still no capital to pay foreign merchants, and foreign exchange cannot be exchanged for transfer notes. As a result, foreign trade is still not solved.</p>
<p>Second, it is impossible to prohibit the discounting of transfer notes. Because of the above reasons, the need for 法幣 is still very urgent. Cash holders can take the opportunity to make profits; and discounting businesses are scattered everywhere, and there are no officials who can prohibit them. As a result, there is no difference from the current exchange allocation system.</p>
<p>The above is only focused on general merchants. The difficulties for speculators do not need to be discussed. In fact, this restriction is only temporary in nature. But its reason, that capital escapes, may not be easy to eradicate. There is a certain party disturbing finance behind the scenes, so if there is no fundamental way, that even if it is changed to a checkbook code, it is still feared that new tricks will be invented in the future, and there will be no day of Ning.</p>
<p>In my opinion, speculation has been rampant in the past year. The unexpected increase in the profits of commercial houses is all due to foreign exchange. And the fact that foreign exchange has fallen to half of its previous value is an unprecedented fact in history. One of the reasons is that imports exceed exports. If we do not start by restricting imports and increasing exports, the general doubts about the devaluation of 法幣 will be difficult to eliminate, and eventually the shrinking of foreign exchange and the surge in prices will form a situation in which people cannot live. If the government can find a way to control imports and increase exports, there are still ways to deal with the number of applications slightly, otherwise financial stability is almost hopeless.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Price Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash price of bare gold on the black market was not traded due to the public holiday. It is said that the buying and selling outside the market were all waiting and watching, so the opening was not made, but the price was still around 2,600 yuan. The price of gold jewelry per tael in Shanghai was still 263 yuan at Da Tong Bank, 261 yuan at Xin Tong Bank, and 255 yuan for purchases. In addition, according to a London cable on July 1, the price of English pure gold rose by half a pence per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 6 pence and a half.</p>
<p>According to a London cable on July 1, the silver market was bought by India, and speculators were engaged in both trading and trading. The market was flat with little trading. Large silver bars increased by .0625 for the near term and did not move for the long term. According to a New York silver cable, the US spot market was closed for business. According to a Bombay silver cable, the Indian silver market was weak. Spot and July fell by 8 annas, and August fell by 9 annas. The market conditions were uncertain after entering, with a total of 100 transaction orders.</p>
<h3>The Future of the New Exchange Allocation System to be Implemented Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Mujie</p>
<p>When the August 13th war broke out, the Ministry of Finance implemented a method to stabilize finance. In order to maintain the funds needed by various industries, a joint lending committee of the Four Banks was set up. However, at that time, industry and commerce were stagnant, and people were moving inward, so the demand for funds was not urgent; and the lending committee still had direct and indirect lending to the financial industry, so the bank still had remedial measures for deposits. Today's situation is different. People from all over the world gather in the concessions, and banks are the hub for the storage and turnover of funds. After the second restriction on deposits on June 22, and after the sudden shrinking of foreign exchange, how can people not be more flustered and cause great panic, so that those who withdraw cash according to the amount are crowded and unbearable. Banks and shops feel that there are more expenses than income, and the lending committee has long since stopped lending directly to the financial industry, then its cash supply can only be sought from the bank and money industry reserve warehouse. The method of exchanging bank and shop exchange allocation deposits for 法幣 can be seen from the saying that "banks and shops must withdraw in advance to meet deposits". However, due to the new restrictions, the market still feels a lack of capital. Therefore, in order to adjust the capital supply of the industry and to meet the needs of industry and commerce, the issuance of exchange allocation to fellow traders is carried out again; and in order to facilitate the acceptance and delivery of exchange allocation to fellow traders, exchange allocation certificates for fellow traders are issued. This method, whether in theory or in fact, is the best way to increase capital in the Shanghai market. At present, the stability of Shanghai's finance and the supply of industrial and commercial funds should be carried out under the principle of shrinking the amount of 法幣 and expanding the amount of exchange allocation, so as to prevent the Japanese from obtaining 法幣 to buy foreign exchange and to support legitimate industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Now the fellow trader exchange allocation of the Silver Preparation Association and those constituted after August 13 have undergone differences in nature; the old exchange allocation was generated based on the supplementary method of stabilizing finance negotiated by the silver and money industry, and its substance is the liability of the silver and money industry, that is, the balance between the promissory notes issued by the silver and money industry and the Ministry of Commerce. The new exchange allocation (ie, the exchange allocation of fellow traders, hereinafter imitated) is a new capital generated by the property of various banks and shops as preparation. The old exchange allocation can only be transferred between fellow traders. The value of the assets that the owner of the exchange allocation funds can represent is a check-type check only. The new exchange allocation has the issuance of exchange allocation certificates for the convenience of acceptance and delivery. The Silver Preparation Association can pay for the exchange allocation check with exchange allocation certificates in addition to the transfer; the owner of the exchange allocation funds can use a currency-type exchange allocation certificate to represent the value of its assets. The old exchange allocation can only be circulated with checks, so its exercise is restricted by the check law. In addition to circulating with checks, the new exchange allocation can also be circulated with exchange allocation certificates, and the exchange allocation certificates can be exchanged for new certificates if they are dirty or broken, and except for the banks and shops that receive them, applications for loss reporting and stop payment are not allowed, because it is no different from banknotes. It is that the wooden quality of the new exchange allocation is far better than the old exchange allocation.</p>
<p>Although, the door to the spot cash exchange on the market is not closed due to the release of 22 million 法幣 of the old exchange allocation, and the exercise of the exchange allocation of fellow traders. What the bank pays to the exchange allocation depositor is the check or exchange allocation certificate of the fellow trader. If the owner of the new exchange allocation must use 法幣, he will inevitably go to the way of discounting. Furthermore, if the owner of the new exchange allocation needs to use 法幣, it is not for commercial purposes, but for capital flight, that is, for commercial purposes, but for the import of luxury goods that have nothing to do with people's livelihood and foreign exchange, which is also indirectly threatening the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai. The reason why the old exchange allocation was not valued was precisely because foreign commercial banks were unwilling to accept this kind of note, and the general import foreign companies also had to exchange it for 法幣 because it could not be directly converted into foreign exchange, so there was discounting. Now the new exchange allocation preparation inspection committee has the participation of representatives from the Foreign Commercial Bank Association, so that its credit can be promoted to the use of foreign companies and there should be no problem. However, the fact that the new exchange allocation cannot purchase foreign exchange is the same; and the new exchange allocation has not yet been implemented, and industries such as silk and satin, hardware, color printing, and refining have already published announcements that 法幣 will be used in general. If payment is made by exchange allocation, the discount will be based on the market price of the day. Although this move is not to deal with the upcoming new exchange allocation, the new exchange allocation will be paid to the exchange allocation depositor by the bank, which will at least hinder its circulation to a considerable extent, and it is feared that discounting will be difficult to stop.</p>
<p>Some say that after the new exchange allocation is exercised, it will inevitably cooperate with the money exchange industry to prohibit general small money shops and silver shops from engaging in exchange allocation discounting. It is necessary to know that if there is a need for discounting, how can empty words of prohibition be effective. Some think that even if it cannot be prohibited, the Silver Preparation Association will no longer come out to maintain it, and let the discount rate soar, and try to make it smooth to use by shrinking the 法幣 capital and circulating the exchange allocation capital. Although there will still be discounting for a while, but after a long time, the 法幣 capital shrinks, and those who engage in discounting will reach this point, even if there is a market, it will be extremely high, even if there is a transaction, it will be extremely small, and what kind of phenomenon will the new exchange allocation produce, which we currently predict; that is, the discount is gradually rising, and those legitimate commercial transactions, such as those that can find ways to avoid using cash to purchase goods, will not be willing to exchange 法幣 at a high price, (such as after the 6.22 restriction on deposit, the discount is high, but there is a price but no market), at this time, if there is still exchange allocation discounting, it must belong to improper purposes. Since those legitimate commercial transactions are unwilling to exchange 法幣 by exchange allocation to purchase goods, the principle of the current 法幣 transaction of industry and commerce will inevitably be difficult to adhere to, otherwise customers will leave in dismay, is it not giving up the opportunity to operate on their own! As a result, exchange allocation may be circulated smoothly, those foreign companies that also engage in import and export. After receiving the exchange allocation funds, they can use it to purchase local goods for export and generate foreign exchange, which is used to purchase foreign goods; if this is the case, those who specialize in import only have the receipt of exchange allocation, and those who specialize in export have the receipt of foreign currency or 法幣, and import foreign companies will inevitably go to the export. Foreign companies discount to purchase 法幣, give it to purchase foreign exchange, or directly purchase a certain amount of foreign exchange with more exchange allocation than using 法幣 to purchase. As a result, the increase or decrease in the value of imported foreign goods will depend on the amount of the value of exported local goods, so that trade can be balanced, or even if imports still exceed exports, it will inevitably form foreign investment. The phenomenon of trade balance or the formation of investment, coupled with the reduction of 法幣 capital and the increase of exchange allocation capital, Shanghai's black market foreign exchange on trade reduces other pressures at the time, and the market has the possibility of tending to stabilize and lengthen, The phenomenon of prices, although it will not fall temporarily due to the shrinking of 法幣 and the lengthening of foreign exchange, at least the trend of endless rise can be stopped.</p>
<p>However, the effectiveness of this prediction must be slow, and it is still built on the principle that exchange allocation can be circulated smoothly, and the market 法幣 can be contracted, and the smooth circulation of exchange allocation must be especially in the allocation and balance of exchange allocation and foreign exchange receipts and payments between foreign companies specializing in import and export. How to promote its implementation? Otherwise, foreign companies specializing in import only have the receipt of exchange allocation and cannot convert foreign exchange, and they will inevitably refuse to accept it after a long time. Foreign companies specializing in import will refuse to accept it first, and other industries will inevitably refuse to accept it later. Isn't it a pity to repeat the mistakes of the old exchange allocation! Therefore, I provide a stupid opinion as above.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Sea Cucumber Transactions are Quiet</h3>
<p>Sea cucumbers have been near the sudden change in foreign exchange, and the cost has been high, with a huge increase of 20 to 30 yuan compared before and after. However, at the moment, it has not been sold, and transactions are quiet, but it will be difficult to combine the planning of goods that come later, so those shops that have a little bottom deposit do not want to sell it. Although it is not intentional to hoard goods, it is actually the environment that makes it so.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diaoqing Rises Again</h3>
<p>According to London cable, the sugar market fluctuated slightly yesterday. The recent August rose by one pence, to eight shillings and three pence and a half. The long-term slightly decreased, with December at six shillings and five pence, and March of next year at six shillings, five pence and two five. The Shanghai Association's plan had not changed much. Spot two four coarse white called the original price, 20 yuan and 5 corners of the customs warehouse, Tai Gu car white B Mark Xizhan 30 yuan, Dongzhan 29 yuan and 8 corners, DY Mark Xizhan rose 2 corners, to 29 yuan, DX Mark rose 3 corners, to 28 yuan and 8 corners, H Mark car red 19 yuan and 6 corners, spot Dutch red 20 yuan and 8 corners, all rose by 1 corner, and the rest remained unchanged. Guo Tang has built a gang to open more than 200 packages of Diao Qing, with a price of 16 yuan and 7 corners.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Yizhiren Goods will be Out of Stock</h3>
<p>Yizhiren's goods here have been sold out one after another, and they are about to be out of stock, and the source has been cut off again. At the moment, the going is very busy, and there is a lot of supply and demand, so the selling price has suddenly increased by 20 yuan, and it is unusually popular.</p>

<h3>A Strict Distinction Should Be Made Between Asexuality and Impotence</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Loda Medical School</p>
<p>Young people in the early stages of development should understand that the onset of sexual arousal does not mean that the reproductive organs are fully mature. Therefore, sexual behavior should not be engaged in too early. As the saying goes, "Fruits picked unripe are not suitable for consumption." Therefore, early marriage is definitely not advisable. On the one hand, it hinders the development of the body, and on the other hand, it is not easy to have healthy children. Therefore, men and women should wait until after the age of twenty to marry. However, according to modern medical observations, the age difference between couples should be based on libido. This is because couples have the obligation to cohabitate. Whether their union is based on traditional familial ties or modern romantic relationships, sexual matters are the primary concern. Therefore, the union of a couple should be based on libido. A man's libido may not decline even in old age, while a woman's libido usually ceases around the age of forty-five. However, lacking libido is one thing, and being unable to engage in sexual activity is another. Although some men's libido does not decline even in old age, their ability to engage in sexual activity usually ceases around the age of sixty. This is because men are in an active position and require considerable energy to perform sexually, even if they have libido. Although women's libido declines around the age of forty-five, they can still engage in sexual activity beyond the age of sixty. This is because they are entirely in a passive position, like a machine. Even without libido, they can still engage in sexual activity. Therefore, it is not advisable, from a physiological and hygienic standpoint, for an old man to marry a young woman or for a young man to marry an old woman. This is because when an old man marries a young woman, the young woman's libido is at its peak and urgently seeks satisfaction, while the old man may have libido but lack the energy to engage in sexual activity. As a result, the old man exhausts his energy, while the young woman remains unsatisfied. The outcome is detrimental to both parties. The man may develop neurasthenia, back pain, kidney deficiency, and even death, while the woman may develop mental illness, such as sexual anesthesia, if this continues for a long time. However, the best remedy is to quickly increase energy and rejuvenate the reproductive function, eliminating kidney deficiency, impotence, premature aging, neurasthenia, and other ailments. I am a venereal disease specialist, and I know that the only way to achieve the aforementioned rejuvenation is to take the German male "Butikon," a preparation made from the essence of strong animal testicles, to fulfill your wishes. The female "Butikon" is a famous medicine for regulating menstruation, promoting fertility, and treating sexual anesthesia. Therefore, I dare to recommend it to patients.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>The Most Standard Gonorrhea Medication</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a disease that comes on fiercely and is not easily cured, causing patients great distress. People often rashly try various medications, hoping for a quick cure, but the results are invariably disappointing. The treatment of gonorrhea is indeed a difficult matter and should not be handled carelessly. This responsibility should only be entrusted to experienced physicians whose treatment methods can be effective. Unfortunately, many gonorrhea patients do not understand the harm they are doing to themselves and indiscriminately take inferior medications from the market, turning what could have been a quickly cured gonorrhea into a difficult one. To fundamentally resolve gonorrhea, it is crucial to choose the right doctor and medication, so that there is hope of curing the disease quickly. This is the secret to choosing the right gonorrhea treatment. In particular, attention should be paid to oral medications for gonorrhea, as they provide an opportunity for many financially disadvantaged patients to be cured.</p>
<p>However, the market is flooded with over-the-counter drugs, making it difficult for patients to choose. Based on my experience, only "Clinon," invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, can defeat all the unreasonable over-the-counter drugs on the market. This is because "Clinon" has been personally tested by the world's leading gonorrhea experts and proven to be uniquely successful in treating gonorrhea. After taking "Clinon," it exerts anti-gonococcal effects within a few hours, so it is actually effective within a few hours. Secondly, "Clinon" has a thorough bactericidal effect. Ordinary oral medications for gonorrhea are slow to take effect and only reach the superficial areas. If the gonococci have escaped into the deeper, more widespread areas, then general medications are ineffective. Thirdly, the drug is mild, so it is guaranteed to have no adverse side effects. Due to the above advantages, taking "Clinon" is always beneficial. It is effective in treating gonorrheal prostatitis, epididymitis, urethritis, cystitis, arthritis, etc., in a short period of time. For external use, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water," and women can use "Karexedi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories for even faster results.</p>
<h3>How to Subdue Pulmonary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis is a terrible disease, and it is a very chronic disease. The treatment takes a long time and requires a lot of money. Therefore, some people say that tuberculosis is a rich man's disease, that is, only people with money are qualified to get this disease, and people without money only have a dead end. In fact, this is not the case. Regardless of any lung disease, based on my years of experience, "Lung Tonic" is indeed an effective agent for treating early second and third stage lung diseases. This is because this agent has the function of eliminating oxygen in lung diseases, causing the bacteria to lose their activity. Therefore, hemoptysis, chest pain, night sweats, and fever caused by tuberculosis can be relieved immediately. For relieving cough and eliminating phlegm, surgical operations are not necessary, and lung cavities can be repaired. Major European and American tuberculosis sanatoriums and experts all instruct patients to take this agent at home.</p>
<h3>The Health Problems of Young Men with Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Nine out of ten young men experience nocturnal emission. Why is this? Although there is a distinction between physiological and pathological nocturnal emission, we doctors often find that those who lose their health due to nocturnal emission start with physiological nocturnal emission. This shows that if this condition is not paid attention to at all times, it can gradually become frequent, or even turn from nocturnal emission to spermatorrhea, then the situation has become dangerous.</p>
<p>Young men who masturbate can hardly avoid this condition. If the cause of the disease is not eradicated, even if they take medication for treatment, it will be difficult to restore their health. Those who indulge in masturbation must deeply reflect on this point. Especially young men who are just developing, every drop of their essence and blood is a major component for building brainpower and muscle, so it should not be wasted.</p>
<p>If nocturnal emission is not treated early, it will inevitably lead to neurasthenia and may also cause other venereal diseases. The treatment of this condition should emphasize both nourishment and medication. Patients should strictly prohibit excessive sexual activity, abstain from alcohol, and get sufficient sleep. If they can perform local cold water friction, it will be even more beneficial.</p>
<p>As for drug treatment, the best is "Naires Nocturnal Emission Tablets," which can completely cure the disease. However, if neurasthenia or sexual dysfunction is caused by prolonged nocturnal emission, then "Butikon" should also be taken to nourish the deficiency.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Forum</p>
<h3>Special Treatment for Acute Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Acute gonorrhea is often unbearable due to its excruciating pain, leading to rash treatment. As a result, although the pain is temporarily reduced or subsided, this is merely a form of anesthetic pain relief. Before long, the pain becomes even more severe than before. At this point, patients begin to realize that their condition has worsened and consider changing their course of action. Therefore, when gonorrhea first begins, do not entrust it to mediocre physicians, lest the originally curable acute gonorrhea be mistreated by doctors who do not understand the principles of gonorrhea, who perform surgery indiscriminately and prescribe inferior medications, seeking only immediate relief and forgetting the harm to patients in the future. Is this not a predicament caused by patients' carelessness in seeking medical treatment and choosing medication?</p>
<p>Acute gonorrhea mostly occurs after intercourse with unclean prostitutes. After an incubation period of about three to four days to five to six days, prodromal symptoms appear, such as stinging and burning pain during urination. These are all phenomena of the prodromal period. Afterward, these symptoms become more severe, and the urethral opening becomes red and swollen, and the glans and foreskin become terribly swollen. Purulent secretions clog the urethra, making urination very painful. However, this pain is actually a physiological reaction and should not be anesthetized rashly, which would reduce resistance. The fundamental way to relieve pain is to eradicate the gonococci. For this treatment, only the gonorrhea-specific drug "Clinon" should be taken, along with German static electricity therapy. This is because "Clinon" can kill gonococci and eliminate inflammation caused by gonococci after taking it. Only by quickly killing the gonococci can the pain of acute gonorrhea be fundamentally resolved. To achieve this goal of relieving pain, fighting gonorrhea, and reducing inflammation, "Clinon" and static electricity therapy must be adopted as reliable methods. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 appointment tickets will be given out each day, with each ticket costing only 5 jiao. A free copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases," worth 1 yuan, will be given away.</p>

<h3>English Female Musician Performs</h3>
<p>The affairs of Western theaters are very different from those in China. Celebrated members of the troupe are treated with respect by outsiders, unlike the performers in China, who are generally seen as mere itinerant entertainers. Now, a newly arrived English female musician of great renown, named Arabella Goddard, has come to Shanghai. She is touring the world for pleasure and sightseeing. When she performs her skills in the places she visits, she often dislikes that the income is less than one-hundredth of what she earns in England, and only sees it as a way to subsidize her travel expenses. It is said that she will perform at the Western theater in Shanghai for several days. The traffic will be heavy, and it will be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>New Style Rickshaws</h3>
<p>The two-wheeled rickshaw is the newest invention in Shanghai. These new style vehicles can be seen on the main streets of the concession. These vehicles come from Japan and are called jinrikisha, which were invented a few years ago. The people of that country found them useful, so they widely used them. There are already over a thousand in Yokohama. The drivers pull them very quickly, and they can almost keep pace with horse-drawn carriages. Compared to the local wheelbarrows, they have advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage is that they can only carry one person; the advantage is that they are more convenient for the passenger. Since this vehicle is crude, many dignified people disdain to ride in it. Those who cannot afford to keep a sedan chair at home often find it inconvenient to travel. Now that there are rickshaws, it will be much more convenient for these people.</p>
<h3>Chinese-Western Dictionary Completed</h3>

<h3>Poetry Recitation in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Lin Xiao</p>
<p>The first poetry recitation in Shanghai was held in a private living room upstairs. Those present included poets, composers, and playwrights, because poetry recitation requires musicality and theatrical movements to enhance its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The poems recited were: Bai Shu's "Taierzhuang," Feng Yuanjun's "Withdrawal," Shi Ling's "Shadow," Pushkin's "Gypsies," as well as Xi Jin's "Rainy Spring Day" and Hua Ling's "Turtle." Other songs included "Nostalgia" (Camel Song, Zhang Hao's music), "I Come from the Countryside" (same composer and lyricist); records included Old Folks at Home, as well as a record of Keats's poetry recitation.</p>
<p>That day's poetry recitation can only be regarded as an experiment in poetry recitation in Shanghai. Based on the recitation of various poets, my overall opinion is: because the poems of each poet are not very popular, many words that even I, an "intellectual," do not recognize, how can the "deaf ears" of the masses hear them? Also, Shi Ling's "Shadow," with its profound meaning and mournful tone, is even more unsuitable as a basic line for popularizing poetry recitation. Secondly, Miss Shen, who recited Bai Shu's "Taierzhuang" that day, undoubtedly achieved great success, because she was able to grasp all (or at least most) of the emotions of the poet when he wrote "Taierzhuang"; on the contrary, a certain female poet was much worse when reading Pushkin's "Gypsies." From this, we can know that to recite other people's poems, one must at least grasp the emotions of the poem. If one recites one's own poems, then the tone must be paid very close attention to (this is also one of the important conditions when reciting other people's poems.)</p>
<p>I have already said that that day's poetry recitation can only be regarded as an experiment in the poetry recitation movement in Shanghai. Because it is an experiment, I would like to offer some more suggestions: in the future, if we hold poetry recitation again, I think everyone should discuss it after each poem is recited; for example, whether the poem itself is suitable for recitation, whether the tone and movement of the recitation of the poem are appropriate, and so on. Here, I think we should invite the so-called masses who do not understand poetry to listen carefully to the poetry recitation and then solicit their opinions, which will be of great help to the progress of the Shanghai poetry recitation movement.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned gathering of "poets, composers, and playwrights," there is another type of poetry recitation in Shanghai that is worth mentioning: a public recitation in front of a crowd of four or five hundred people at a certain celebration. The poems recited that day included Gorky's "Sunrise and Sunset" and Xu Xingzhi's "Lighthouse" (published in the poetry journal "I Sing"). The former was recited by Miss Shen, who recited "Taierzhuang." Since poetry recitation is still a "stranger" to the masses in Shanghai, the "audience" listened in surprising silence. The latter, "Lighthouse," although the poem itself is a narrative poem and is quite suitable for recitation, the reciter's recitation skills were too poor, and the "Lighthouse" was very long. So the audience became impatient, some quietly left before the recitation was over, and some talked to each other.</p>
<p>The poetry recitation movement in Shanghai does not seem to be outstanding, but poetry recitation in Shanghai is still a tender sprout. Moreover, the climate in Shanghai is very harmful to that tender sprout. Therefore, I have great respect for those two poetry recitations and hold unlimited hope.</p>
<p>This tender sprout will surely flourish into a strong tree, as long as our poetry workers continue to work hard!</p>
<h3>On the Front Lines</h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>— Field Notes</p>
<p>After a considerable period of stalemate, the war on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway has suddenly become active again. Their sole objective, it goes without saying, is to threaten Wuhan; however, the line from Gushi, thanks to the valiant resistance of the ××× Division, has not changed at all. The so-called abandonment of Xinyang is simply like seeing a ghost in broad daylight. We originally intended to return to Anhui from Shangqiu, but upon hearing the news of the counterattack, we resumed our original plan to go to the front lines and then transfer to Anhui. Once we reached Xinyang County, we were reminded of the scenery of Jiangnan. Among the crisscrossing fields, golden rice paddies were everywhere, and the farmers were harvesting. The sound of the scythes cutting rice and the flowing water formed a symphony. Originally, Xinyang was located in the upper reaches of the Huai River, and the entire area was a vast plain. The Dabie Mountains to the south were distantly arched in a row, and the Pingjing, Jiuli, and Wusheng passes stood majestically on top, with a very dangerous terrain. The Pinghan Railway tunnel runs beside Wusheng Pass, just like the gateway to Xinyang. Jiugong Mountain is located north of Jiuli Pass. Therefore, the flames of war burned in the suburbs of this strategically important area, which was a must-win place for the military.</p>
<p>The air in the countryside still seemed very peaceful; but as soon as we went to the front lines, we immediately felt the tension. The roar of field guns shook the earth, and transport vehicles flew back and forth, weaving through the trees. Brave armed fighters, some marching in formation, their gleaming bayonets emitting a strong light, some walking back and forth in the fields, singing marching songs, and some drawing water by the stream to wash their battle clothes. Groups of war horses were happily grazing on the grass, swinging their tails, and making rustling noises. In short, everything on the front lines makes you feel a different kind of mood, and deeply feel your own insignificance, ordinariness, and cowardice.</p>
<p>As we walked towards a village close to the front lines, hunger burned in our bellies. Miss Wu was searching everywhere for corn (maize) to solve the problem of dinner, while an old farmer in the village had already sent a basket of boiled eggs. "If you want to eat rice porridge, you have to wait for it to cook," he said sincerely, a kind smile appearing from the wrinkles on his forehead.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, eggs are very good!"</p>
<p>"Are you not afraid of artillery fire?" Old Yao asked casually.</p>
<p>"Afraid? What are we afraid of? It can destroy our bodies, but it can't kill our patriotic souls!" The old farmer, perhaps a philosopher, answered Old Yao's question in such a humorous way.</p>
<p>As dusk approached, the artillery fire became more intense, and the small mortars were also roaring. The whizzing bullets streaked past like meteors. At the same time, the sound of the bombs exploding on the ground made people feel particularly excited. We watched the division commander Zhou pointing at the map and issuing orders in the division headquarters; on his face was an expression of indifference. "Wasting bullets as much as possible, that's their specialty!" he said, chewing on the dishes.</p>

<h3>Casual Talk</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Now we have received a letter from a reader asking us to recommend some "cheap, good, positive, and just books and magazines." We are very willing to do this. But there are too many books, and we don't have time to look at them one by one and introduce them. We hope that readers will write us some honest book reviews to help us. As for magazines, we will list some of the ones we can think of now for you to try:</p>

<h3>The Life of the Great Ukrainian Poet Shevchenko (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chishou</p>
<p>Turgenev, in his masterpiece "Rudin," deliberately used an old stubborn character to scold the literature of Little Russia, which represented the general opinion of the old Russian era. But in fact, that "backward" nation, which had been oppressed for a long time, also produced many great writers. Gogol, who occupies the most important page in the history of Russian literature, was actually a Ukrainian. However, there are many writers whose works have not been widely disseminated and are simply unknown to the general public, but are actually important writers in their nation. Now I want to introduce a figure whose name can occasionally be seen in literary history but whose life is rarely described in detail.</p>
<p>This figure is the great Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko.</p>
<p>On February 25, 1814, this poet was born in a village near the Dnieper. His parents were serfs, and they both died when he was eight years old. The first school he attended was a private church school, where he suffered abuse and hard labor. But he liked to read and write, which surprised his drunken teacher. After his drunken teacher died, he went to live with a painter in a neighboring village under his protection. He wanted to learn to paint, but the painter took his hand, looked at it, shook his head, and that was it. Finally, he could no longer bear the painter's abuse and fled back to his own village, where he ended up herding cattle.</p>
<p>However, fate pulled him in another direction. The master he worked for was a Polish nobleman who actually "took a liking" to him and asked him to be his personal attendant. This gave him the opportunity to visit major cities such as Warsaw, Vilnius, and St. Petersburg. His master also saw his talent in painting. In Warsaw, he had him study under Lempi, a famous painter at the time; in Petersburg, he sent him to a decorative painter named Ohiriaev. He worked very hard, day and night. Because he went to the park to sketch, he was noticed by a Ukrainian painter, Sonehenko, and immediately, he gained a new friend. And it was this new friend who led him to the great painter Brulov. His fate had a turning point. Brulov truly recognized his genius and decided to have him study at the Academy of Fine Arts. But he was a serf, and according to the rules, he was not qualified to enter the academy. Fortunately, his new friend was very enthusiastic, so he and the famous poet Joukovski went to his noble master to intercede and discuss redeeming him. Joukovski painted a portrait and sold it at a high price. Joukovski was the emperor's tutor, and his portrait was indeed bought by the royal family. So two thousand five hundred rubles were obtained, and Shevchenko was free.</p>
<p>After entering the Academy of Fine Arts, he soon amazed his peers with the demeanor of a great painter. But he was not satisfied with the visual arts under his pen, and he also began to write poetry. According to his diary, he wanted to write poetry for the sake of his motherland, Ukraine. He wanted to temper the Ukrainian language into rhythmic verse and also make it singable for the people. He said: "I know that the history of painting is my profession and the source of my future livelihood, but when I was studying the mysteries of art under the guidance of the immortal Brulov, I admired poetry——that poetry that did not earn me a penny and even took away my freedom!" Because his poetry protected Ukraine, it also offended the Tsar, and later he became a criminal because of this.</p>
<p>The time was 1845. He had completed his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts and returned to Ukraine. Kyiv (the capital of Ukraine) University had already decided to hire him as a professor of charcoal drawing, but unexpectedly, an unfortunate incident occurred.</p>
<p>At that time, a group of outstanding figures gathered in Kyiv, including the famous historian Kostomarov and the historian and writer Hulak——they were all leaders of the Ukrainian youth at the time, and they were organizing a group there called the "Cyril and Methodius Society," whose purpose was to liberate Ukraine from the Tsar's rule and move towards the future of an autonomous state.</p>
<h3>"Open Door"</h3>

<h3>Salted Pork Soup with Tofu</h3>
<p>— Pin Pin</p>
<p>Once, I discussed creative methods with several friends. We believed that Shanghai's literature and art were too depressed, lacking works with vitality; there were many reasons, but the main one was the harsh environment of Shanghai. The external pressure was too great, literary and artistic workers lost their freedom, and even if they had passionate and exciting things to say, they had to stop halfway in order to protect literary publications and even their own lives. As a result, empty and sentimental works gradually increased, and Shanghai's literature and art seemed to be on a path of decline.</p>
<p>So we wanted to suggest a creative method to adapt to the environment of Shanghai, while not obliterating the primary meaning of national identity in literature. After thinking for a while, a friend said:</p>
<p>"Let's use the method of salted pork soup with tofu."</p>
<p>I felt it was abrupt and asked this friend what kind of method this creative method was. He replied:</p>
<p>"Don't we often eat this kind of economical soup when we eat? It tastes very good, but you have to be careful when you eat it. When the waiter brings up the salted pork and tofu soup, if someone impatient picks up a spoon and sends it into their mouth, it will surely burn their tongue and make their throat ache. Originally, the bowl of soup is lifeless, without a wisp of hot air, but the heat is hidden under the oil, without showing any signs, and has not disappeared at all. -- Do you understand? I won't say anymore, let you write the article."</p>
<p>In fact, although I wrote this article, it is difficult to elaborate. His analogy is very clear. Adding more would be uninteresting. However, I think it's okay to quote a few more sentences.</p>
<p>First, I think this salted pork soup with tofu is a good creative method. It is of course better in Shanghai, and can also be used occasionally in the inland. The inland has a full freedom of air. Both encouragement and criticism can be expressed frankly, and the effect is also great. If it is all the same, to prevent being disgusted, salted pork soup with tofu is a good seasoning, for example, like "Mr. Hua Wei" which is somewhat similar to this, and very popular. As for Shanghai, this place should be developed everywhere: on the one hand, it will not cause superficial conflicts with the environment, and on the other hand, the potential power of literature and art will be preserved. Finally, as in physics, static energy will be transformed into kinetic energy.</p>
<p>Second, salted pork soup with tofu is a creative method that is not easy to succeed. The most important thing is the selection of content. Recently, I have seen some works that often write an article because of one thing (very ordinary things, such as sea water, moonlight, souvenirs from lovers, products from hometowns, etc.), saying what limits my loneliness, I saw it and thought of the fall of my hometown, oh, oh, an article is completed. It looks like there is no difference from this tofu soup, but after careful investigation, these tofu have really become tofu, without bones and blood, just an empty piece. This is waste, a disguised skeleton. Therefore, tofu is just an analogy, in fact, it should be transformed into a life form with bones, blood and flesh. In terms of form, it should not be draped in too gorgeous prose. We only want economical and simple salted pork soup, not chicken juice and shark fin soup. Only salted pork soup is a food for the public, and our literature is dedicated to the public. If the form is too elegant, the internal heat will be completely eliminated; readers will be fascinated by the appearance and will not seek it deep inside.</p>
<p>Third, salted pork soup with tofu is originally a method that is outwardly dry and inwardly strong, solid but not flashy. The outside looks very cold, plain and gentle, and the inside is very hot, distinctive and stimulating, easy to taste and difficult to let go, a smiling tiger, a sword hidden in the fish, the role of literature is exhausted. The spirit that holds the creative method is symbolism (active). I may have the opportunity to talk about it. Here, I hope that the salted pork and tofu-like literature of Shanghai will be served bowl by bowl, so that those who seek spiritual food can have a full meal.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Following the Ministry of Finance's Telegraphic Restrictions on Withdrawals</h3>
<p>— Yonghua</p>
<p>After August 13th, the Ministry of Finance issued the "Measures for Stabilizing Finance in Extraordinary Times" and its supplementary measures, and the scope of implementation was not limited to Shanghai; even in Shanghai, at the beginning of the implementation of these measures, people were at ease. At that time, so-called remittances and legal tender were both used as chips in general transactions that did not involve foreign exchange, and the legal price was no different. The only difference was that for small daily expenses, it was inconvenient to use remittances and transfers, so legal tender had to be used as a medium of exchange. The discounting of remittances and bills of exchange was never said to be non-existent, or to be distinguished from the clearing power of legal tender, and to lower its value could truly be described as disrupting finance. This was because there were not as many people trying to profit from the national crisis as there are today, and in the situation at the time, the "Measures for Stabilizing Finance" issued by the Ministry of Finance were still generally recognized as having legal effect, and few dared to disagree, so they could achieve great results for a time. Unexpectedly, since the formation of an isolated island in one corner of the land, funds have become more concentrated and lack of use. The excited hearts of the past have gradually become cold, and then so-called foreign exchange black markets have risen up, raising their eyebrows and winking to exchange foreign exchange for legal tender. The demand for foreign exchange has continued to rise, and the natural economic trends and their causes are not something that [I] wish to discuss in depth. Only from a legal perspective, the previous "Measures for Stabilizing Finance" could be implemented in the inland for a long time without hindrance. Why is it that they have gradually become ineffective only in Shanghai, and the Ministry of Finance must use the recent telegraphic restrictions again to remedy them? This must be attributed to the silver and money industry's joint preparatory committee's publicly set exchange rate for remittances and the court's judgment that remittances do not have clearing power, which some dare to disregard.</p>
<p>In the past, when the black market discount rate for remittances reached seventy or eighty yuan, the silver and money industry's joint preparatory committee, entrusted by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, came out to refuse to take responsibility for stabilization, and it cannot be said that the motivation was not good. However, according to the original measures of the Ministry of Finance, its main purpose was to restrict the arbitrary acquisition of foreign exchange, and the legitimate need for foreign exchange was still being continuously supplied. Therefore, those who turned to the black market for foreign exchange because the state refused to supply foreign exchange could not be said to be legitimate. The joint preparatory committee turned remittances between colleagues into legal tender that could be used to cash out foreign exchange on the black market, setting a public standard. As a result, the effectiveness of stabilizing finance was completely lost, and those who refused to accept remittances had a reason to do so.</p>
<p>Judicial judgments should abide by laws and regulations and make appropriate interpretations to apply them; the so-called laws and regulations should include the codes passed through the legislative process and the orders mentioned in Article 76 of the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. The "Measures for Stabilizing Finance" issued by the Ministry of Finance after August 13th cannot be said to not comply with the orders mentioned in Article 76 of the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. The court should not refuse to cite them, and the appropriate interpretation in the citation should explore the overall purpose of the measures and clarify them, and should not take excerpts out of context and have a superficial understanding of the wording. Once there was a case where foreign merchants leasing land refused to pay rent with remittances and were involved in litigation. The judgment was based on the reason that remittances were limited to use between colleagues and that rent must be paid in legal tender. However, it is not known that the measures set by the ministry, remittances limited to colleagues, refer to their transfer through colleagues for clearance, and not to the act of exchanging them for legal tender; they do not mean that they cannot be regarded as chips, circulated among people outside the silver and money industry, or that the legal price of this chip should be reduced compared to legal tender. Those foreign merchants came to make profits, and they were indifferent to the stability of our finance and the maintenance of national policies. It is not worth deeply criticizing them for being unwilling to accept remittances and trying to seek fortune through litigation. The judicial officials failed to explore the true meaning of laws and regulations to correct their mistakes, and took excerpts out of context, denying that remittances had the same clearing power as legal tender. This was fueling the flames, giving foreign merchants who refused to use them a plausible argument, and giving those who tried to profit from the national crisis a great boost. The accumulated situation has become the current situation, which cannot be said to be an unprecedented regret.</p>
<p>The past is gone, and the Ministry of Finance's new telegraphic measures restricting the withdrawal of deposits have been implemented again; the scope is limited to Shanghai, and the measures do not affect the collection and delivery in the inland. Those who withdraw more than 500 yuan of legal tender per week are still limited to payment by remittance, which is exclusively for the use of interbank accounts, and those who have deposits transferred to the inland are not restricted. This kind of measure is only to maintain the finance of this city, so that those who try to profit from the national crisis do not have the opportunity to cash out foreign currency with a large amount of legal tender. Therefore, large amounts of payments of more than 500 yuan are all carried out by remittance and transfer, which clearly means that there is no discrimination against remittances, denial of their clearing power, or reduction of their legal price. If we continue to hold on to the previous erroneous interpretations in judgments, saying that they are only limited to interbank use, and doubt that they have the same clearing power as legal tender, then most depositors are not the so-called silver and money industry, and fundamentally the silver and money industry should not be allowed to pay remittances to their depositors as a substitute for clearing. Saying that remittances received by depositors from the silver and money industry cannot be paid to people outside the silver and money industry to clear their debts is absurd in theory and beyond compare. If this statement is followed, then all transactions must be circulated in legal tender, the need for legal tender will increase, the use of remittances will become narrower, and those who are madly trying to profit from the national crisis will beautify their names as stabilization and regulation, and their activities will inevitably be even more rampant than before the telegraphic restrictions, which will unfortunately only harm themselves and benefit others. How to prevent its drawbacks and seek to exert the effectiveness of the telegraphic restrictions is what is hoped for from the court, the silver and money industry's joint preparatory committee, and other parties to change their discriminatory attitude towards remittances.</p>
<p>Research and Criticism</p>
<h3>Discussion of Article 1052, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 4 of the Civil Code</h3>
<p>— Zhou Da'yun</p>
<p>Article 1052, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 4 of our country's new Civil Code states: "A wife abuses the husband's lineal ascendants, or is abused by the husband's lineal ascendants, making it unbearable to live together." This subparagraph is also one of the statutory grounds for divorce. There is one application scenario:</p>
<p>(1) If the wife abuses the husband's lineal ascendants, the husband may request a divorce from the wife.</p>
<p>(2) If the wife is abused by the husband's lineal ascendants, the wife may request a divorce from the husband. This is completely self-evident and does not need to be elaborated. However, upon careful examination of the meaning of this subparagraph, it is all stipulated from the wife's perspective. The position of the husband is not mentioned at all. Suppose the following two situations occur, it will be impossible to rely on:</p>
<p>(1) If the husband abuses the wife's lineal ascendants (can the wife also request a divorce from the husband based on the provisions of this subparagraph?)</p>
<p>(2) If the husband is abused by the wife's lineal ascendants (can the husband also request a divorce from the wife based on the provisions of this subparagraph?)</p>
<p>How should the above two situations be resolved? After careful research, if an analogous interpretation is made, it can of course constitute grounds for divorce. If an analogous interpretation is not made, then it is definitely not grounds for divorce. The difference between the two is very large, and much deliberation is required. Some say that when a wife marries and becomes a member of the husband's family, she takes the husband's domicile as her domicile, and naturally has the possibility of living together with the husband's lineal ascendants. Families in our country have been like this for years. As for the wife's lineal ascendants, they rarely live with the husband. Therefore, the Civil Code, Paragraph 4, does not stipulate it. It is not known that in the usual marriage, the wife takes the husband's domicile as her domicile. As for a matrilocal marriage, it is the opposite. The husband takes the wife's domicile as his domicile (see the provisions of the second half of Article 1002 of the Civil Code, Family Law). Why are you biased towards one side? It can be seen that the provisions of this subparagraph seem to be inadequate and there may be obstacles when applied. It is suggested that in the next amendment to the Civil Code, this subparagraph should be changed to: "If one spouse abuses the other spouse's lineal ascendants, or is abused by the other spouse's lineal ascendants, making it unbearable to live together." This would be more universal. I don't know what contemporary legal experts think.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Article 1052, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code stipulates that "One spouse may request a divorce from the court only if the other spouse has one of the following circumstances." Therefore, the circumstances in each subparagraph of the second paragraph are mutually applicable to both spouses, rather than one-sided. In terms of application, difficulties such as those mentioned by Mr. [Zhou] will not arise. However, the wording of Subparagraph 4 of the second paragraph of this article focuses on the wife's side, which is indeed not good. Now Mr. Zhou intends to amend and correct it, which is indeed very appropriate.</p>
<h3>Civil Procedure Law: Applications That Parties Can Make and Rulings Thereon (Fourth Reading, Every Eighth Issue)</h3>
<p>— Shen Tianbao</p>
<p>The above are the applications that parties are explicitly permitted to make under our current Civil Procedure Law. However, the applications parties can make are not limited to these. If, within the scope permitted by law, it is discovered that there is a need for an application to be made, it can still be made at any time, in order to swiftly achieve the goal of an appropriate judgment. As for the court, upon receiving an application from a party, it will make a ruling either granting or rejecting it. The difference between a ruling and a judgment is that the former pertains to disputes arising in procedure, while the latter pertains to disputes arising in substance. The former does not require oral arguments, while the latter does. Dissatisfaction with the former can lead to an appeal, while dissatisfaction with the latter can lead to a direct appeal. According to our current Civil Procedure Law, except for rulings rejecting a claim or rulings on disputed claims that must include reasons, the rest do not need to include reasons. It is sufficient to explain the content so that the parties can understand. Rulings that are announced do not need to be served, and it is sufficient to record them in the case file. According to Article 230 of the Civil Procedure Law, except where this law stipulates that a judgment should be used, a ruling is used. Therefore, the opportunity to use a ruling is quite extensive. The above-mentioned applications can all be approved or rejected by ruling. In addition, if the court believes that it should dispose of a certain action ex officio, it can also do so by ruling. For clarity and immediate visibility, the rulings are classified below according to their nature:</p>
<p>(1) Rulings for which appeals are explicitly prohibited:</p>
<p>(1) Rulings designating jurisdiction. (23) (2) Rulings rejecting an application to transfer the lawsuit. (28) (3) Rulings that deem the challenge of a judge to be justified. (37) (4) Rulings rejecting an application to correct a judgment. (232) (5) Rulings permitting the change or addition of a claim, or rulings stating that a claim is not a change or addition. (258) (6) Rulings that deem the rejection of an expert witness to be justified. (333) (7) Rulings granting the preservation of evidence. (371) (8) Rulings rejecting an application for mediation. (410) (9) Rulings by the original court’s presiding judge to suspend the execution of the original ruling during an appeal. (488) (10) Rulings by the appellate court to suspend the execution of the original ruling during an appeal, or to make other necessary dispositions. (488) (11) Rulings rejecting an application to issue a payment order. (509) (12) Rulings by the court with jurisdiction on the appropriateness of preliminary injunctions. (533) (13) Rulings declaring interdiction. (605) (14) Rulings rejecting an application to revoke interdiction. (620)</p>
<p>(2) Rulings for which appeals are explicitly permitted: (1) Rulings regarding the participation of a third party in the lawsuit. (60) (2) Rulings ordering court clerks and other personnel to bear expenses incurred due to litigation actions. (89) (4) Rulings regarding the return of security deposits. (105) (6) Rulings rejecting an application for service by public notice. (144) (7) Rulings rejecting a declaration to assume the lawsuit. (177) (8) Rulings ordering litigation to proceed. (178) (9) Rulings regarding the suspension of litigation proceedings. (178) (10) Rulings regarding the revocation of the suspension of litigation. (187) (11) Rulings imposing a fine on a witness for failure to appear. (303) (12) Rulings on the appropriateness of refusing to testify. (310) (13) Rulings imposing a fine on a witness for refusing to produce a document. (311) (14) Rulings imposing a fine on a third party who fails to comply with an order to produce a document without justifiable reason. (349) (15) Rulings imposing a fine on a third party who fails to comply with an order to produce an object for inspection without justifiable reason. (367) (16) Rulings regarding provisional attachment. (524) (17) Rulings regarding evidence of security deposit for provisional disposition requests (371) (19) Rulings imposing a fine on a party who fails to appear on the mediation date. (414) (20) Rulings by the appellate court rejecting the appeal as unlawful or revoking or modifying the original ruling because the appeal is justified. (483) (21) Rulings regarding necessary dispositions that may be ordered before the declaration of interdiction to protect the person and property of the person subject to interdiction, and rulings revoking the dispositions. (602) (22) Rulings rejecting an application for interdiction. (603)</p>
<p>(3) Rulings that can be appealed within five days: (1) Rulings rejecting an application to challenge a judge; (36) (2) Rulings regarding an application for an order to provide security for litigation costs, (100) (3) Rulings regarding an application for legal aid, (105) (4) Rulings regarding the revocation of legal aid, (113) (5) Rulings that deem the rejection of an expert witness to be unjustified, (333)</p>

(367) (13) Rulings to preserve evidence ex officio. (372) (14) Rulings rejecting an application for a judgment based on the default of one party. (386) (15) Rulings rejecting an application to supplement provisional execution. (386)</p>
<p>(5) Rulings that can be appealed based on their nature: (1) Rulings by the defendant to allow the transfer of the lawsuit. (118) (2) Rulings on litigation expenses for lawsuits that are terminated without a judgment. (90) (3) Rulings determining the amount of litigation costs. (91) (4) Rulings rejecting the plaintiff's claim because they did not provide security. (101) (5) Rulings correcting a judgment. (232) (6) Rulings rejecting an application to supplement a judgment. (233) (7) Rulings rejecting an unlawful lawsuit. (23) (8) Rulings rejecting a counterclaim. (260) (9) Rulings by each trial court rejecting an unlawful appeal. (441) (10) Rulings by the second instance court rejecting an unlawful appeal. (453) (11) Rulings rejecting the re-trial of the lawsuit. (496) (12) Rulings declaring execution after the period specified in the payment order has passed. (513) (13) After a payment order has been issued, rulings rejecting the debtor's objection. (514) (14) Rulings ordering the obligee to provide security before making a provisional attachment, (522) (15) Rulings regarding the revocation of a provisional attachment, (525) (16) Rulings regarding the revocation of a provisional disposition, (529) (17) Rulings regarding permission to publicize the notice, (236) (18) Rulings rejecting an application for a judgment on proprietary rights, (543) (19) Rulings revoking a prohibition of payment order, (563) (20) Rulings imposing a fine on a party or legal representative for failing to appear, (572) (21) Rulings appointing a special agent for an adopted child, (581) (22) Rulings revoking interdiction, (619) The above is a brief overview of the rulings stipulated in the current Civil Procedure Law. If we combine this with the aforementioned applications that parties can make, then the difficulties encountered in handling the entire Civil Procedure Law do not lie in the filing of the lawsuit and the judgment, but rather in the applications and the rulings. This is because the filing of the lawsuit and the judgment are merely the beginning and end of the Civil Procedure Law. Sometimes the case proceeds smoothly and ends quickly, without any difficulty. As for the applications and rulings, they are all disputes that arise in the middle of the litigation. Sometimes, side issues arise and spread, making them difficult to resolve. Just as one wave subsides, another rises. The litigant suffers from the pain of a case hanging unresolved, not knowing what to do. The court has the concern of attending to one thing and neglecting another, unable to cope. How to utilize the provisions of the law, not to abandon legitimate claims, and also to prevent the abuse of delaying litigation, is what we sincerely hope for. (End)</p>

<p>In the spring of the 24th year of the Republic of China, I rented a one-room bungalow from A, stating that the monthly rent was seven yuan in legal tender. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, although I have been displaced, I have paid the rent as usual without interruption. Unexpectedly, A recently planned to rent the house to someone else, claiming that he could get 15 yuan in rent per month and a deposit of 300 yuan paid in one lump sum. If I want to continue living in this house, I must pay the rent according to this amount, otherwise, I will be forced to move out after one month. However, my finances have been tight since the war. If I increase the rent by two or three yuan, I can still afford it. Please advise: (1) Does A have the right under the law to force the tenant to move out and rent the house to someone else? (2) If I cannot find another house, can I continue to live there with a slight increase in rent or without an increase in rent? (3) If A uses harsh measures, what methods should I use to deal with him? (Yao Chengxiang)</p>
<p>(1) No. (2) Continuing to live there with an increased rent is a matter of mediation and agreement, not a legal issue. (3) Depending on the circumstances, you can appeal to the police station or the court according to the law. (Same)</p>
<p>Suppose A rented a shop from B (i.e., a sub-lessor) two years ago. No written contract was signed at the time, and A did not make any renovations. Now B wants to take back the shop to set up his own business. At the end of last year, he verbally notified A that he must move out of the house by the end of March of this year. A also agreed. When the date arrived, A suddenly used some excuse to refuse to move out. Now, there are the following questions. Please advise: (1) If there is no contract, A does not owe rent, can B take back the shop for his own use? (2) Three months ago, B verbally notified A of a deadline to move out. Can A refuse because he cannot move? (3) If A refuses to move out, can B notify A by registered letter, allowing him one or two months of grace? When the date arrives, if A still refuses to move out, can B apply to the court to order him to move out? (Xia Shigen)</p>
<p>(1) In this kind of indefinite lease relationship, if it can be proven that it is indeed being taken back for one's own use (and there is no intention to increase the rent, using taking it back for one's own use as an excuse), one can claim to terminate the contract. (2) Although notice was given three months ago and the tenant agreed, if it is difficult to move, the tenant can still claim a grace period for moving out according to Article 318, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code. (3) B can originally notify A by registered letter, giving him a reasonable period to move out. If he still does not move out, B can sue the court to order him to move out. However, whether there is a reason still needs to be referred to the above two points for explanation. (Ye Hui)</p>
<p>One year after January 28th, A rented a whole building from B (the sub-lessor). Three years later, B returned to his hometown and wanted to transfer the house to A. A did not want to rent it, so B transferred it to C. At that time, A wanted to move, but C tried hard to keep him and reduced A's rent by one yuan. For the sake of face, A did not move. Since the "August 13th" Shanghai war, the number of residents has suddenly increased. C wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to make a profit and urged A to move, but failed. Then he increased the rent by three yuan. For the previous five months, C added another yuan to A under the guise of rising electricity prices. Recently, the head landlord sent a letter instructing the sub-lessor to increase the rent by 10% across the board. C took the opportunity to ask A to increase the rent by ten yuan. A is now unemployed at home and his finances are weak. He only agreed to increase the rent by 10% according to the head landlord's example. C then told A to move out.</p>
<p>Now respectfully ask:</p>
<p>(1) Can A negotiate with C?</p>
<p>(2) If he sues the court, can A win against C?</p>
<p>(3) Because A cannot rent a house, can he not move?</p>
<p>(4) What is the approximate cost of litigation? Which party is responsible for it? (Lu Hanqiu)</p>
<p>(1) Since A is subletting the house from C and there is a lease relationship, he should negotiate. (2) The outcome of suing the court depends on the evidence and cannot be predicted. (3) A's inability to rent a house is a matter of fact and cannot be used as a reason for defense. (4) The cost of litigation is based on the total amount of two periods of rent. (Yi)</p>
<p>Can the rent be paid with British currency?</p>
<p>Please refer to the Legal Queries column in the second issue of this publication on May 8th of this year.</p>
<p>In the 12th year of the Republic of China, A borrowed five hundred yuan in foreign currency from B and issued a promissory note. B has not repaid it for more than ten years. B hired a lawyer to demand payment, but to no avail. Now A is quite well-off. B plans to sue A. Does this conflict with the 15-year statute of limitations for debt? (Chen Feipeng)</p>
<p>If it cannot be proven that A acknowledged the debt due to the demand, the statute of limitations has now expired. (Yong)</p>
<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3>Father's Disadvantage</h3>
<p>— (Useless)</p>
<p>It seems strange that people in primitive times only knew about mothers and not fathers. But in today's law, parents are also very different. Children take their father's surname. If they take their mother's surname, the father must be a live-in son-in-law or the parents must have agreed otherwise. The father must ask the mother, who has gone through marriage or later marriage. If the father did not marry the mother, then he must be recognized by the father or raised. If the father wants to recognize the child, the child or its birth mother can also deny it, so there are many twists and turns to being a father. As for the mother's relationship with her children, she doesn't need so many procedures. So, there can be people without fathers, but there are no people without mothers. In other words, when a mother gives birth to a child, it is always her child. When a father gives birth to a child, it may not be his child. This is an example of gender inequality. How much fathers lose out, how wronged they are!</p>

<h3>Graduation Exhibition of the Western Painting Department of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts</h3>
<p>— Yu Fu</p>
<p>Requesting Evaluation of Three Years of Achievements</p>
<p>Using a Modest Skill to Help Compatriots in Distress</p>
<p>Artists stranded on the isolated island seem to be unconcerned about the important task of saving the country. However, it cannot be denied that in recent months, exhibitions with the premise of disaster relief have been constantly held. This is the reality of the art world saving the country.</p>
<p>We still remember that in January of this year, the teachers and students of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts held a disaster relief art exhibition, and as a result, nearly 2,000 yuan was raised from the sale of tickets, all of which was donated to the orphanage for the construction of school buildings.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is the earliest art school established in the country, with a long history and a large number of talented people. Therefore, the graduation memorial exhibition held by the new 24th graduating class of the Western Painting Department this semester is worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Their exhibition is jointly hosted by nine graduating students, and it has two meanings:</p>
<p>First, these nine graduates entered the Academy of Fine Arts, and three years have passed in a hurry. In these three years, they have been studying hard day and night. Have they reached the expected level? And how should they plan for further studies in the future? These many questions are confusing in the minds of each student. Therefore, they put out a few oil painting exercises and asked the art world's advanced artists, teachers, relatives, and friends to evaluate them as a reference.</p>
<p>Second, since the War of Resistance, mourning has spread everywhere. Even in Shanghai, compatriots in distress number in the thousands. In an environment where they cannot directly participate in the work of saving the country, they have to use this modest skill of painting to help compatriots in distress, to fulfill their original aspirations, and to fulfill their national duties.</p>
<p>Art is an organic whole and should have the function of metabolism. After several years of research, they have been trying their best to carry out the activities of generating new cells and eliminating old cells, and establishing new art. Therefore, the number of exhibits is only about a hundred, and the themes are only landscapes, still lifes, and figures. The small ones are only a foot long, and the large ones are less than a zhang square. However, in terms of style, there is absolutely no decadent mood of the academic school, vulgar and flashy feelings, and each work is indeed full of the strong and clear spirit of modern art, novel interest, unique personality, and the revelation of youthful vitality.</p>
<p>In order to enrich the content of the exhibition and increase the interest in buying tickets, President Liu Haisu, Western painting professors Guan Liang, Chen Shiwen, and Ru Jia generously donated several masterpieces of oil paintings to be included in the exhibition, giving ticket buyers the opportunity to draw lots.</p>
<p>They also plan to sketch portraits for guests at the venue. Graduating students will sketch at the same time in 20 minutes, and the person being sketched can choose one, which is a very interesting thing.</p>
<p>Now, I hope that people from all walks of life will do their best to guide them and support them. This will not only encourage these young people to pursue new art, but also help thousands of compatriots in distress.</p>
<p>(Note: The exhibition will be held from July 4th to 6th in the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Great World Department Store.)</p>
<h3>Female Storytellers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Biographies of Female Storytellers (II)</p>
<p>"During the Jiaqing period, Zhu Suxian, a woman from Yunjian, often summoned Xiang Jin, a woman from Taicang, to sing and tell stories of various families. … Later, she composed her own 'Jade Lotus Ring' and taught Xiang to sing it. During the Daoguang period, someone wrote the 'Tobacco Case Record' legend, which recorded that there was a female storyteller named Yang Yuzhen who was good at singing the 'Jade Dragonfly' story. Later, she had an affair with a scholar surnamed Zhang, and they used a tobacco case to pledge their love, which led to litigation and exile. The matters are mostly factual, and many Qing people's notes record the events, which are factual. It is also said that she had both beauty and talent, and was the most famous female storyteller at the time."</p>
<p>It can be seen that until the Daoguang period, female storytellers were still independent individuals who sang and told stories everywhere, without a fixed place. By the Xianfeng period, Shanghai became increasingly prosperous, and they gradually gained importance. According to the "Qing Bai Lei Chao," there was at that time "a famous woman named Lu Xiuqing, who was from Wu. She came to Shanghai to escape the war. Her appearance was exquisite, and her art was superb. People competed to invite her. One song was worth eight gold coins. She came slowly and left quickly, and her name was highly regarded for a time." As for fixed storytelling venues, they began around what Wang Tao called "Tudi Temple in the City." It was not until the Tongzhi period that there were "book apartments." Wang Tao's "Song Bin Suo Hua" (1893), Volume 12, "Bamboo Branch Words on Shanghai Storytelling Venues," explained the figures in the early days of book apartments:</p>
<p>The creation of book apartments in Shanghai began with Zhu Sulan. After a long time, this trend became very popular. It was most prosperous in the early years of Tongzhi. Sulan was about fifty years old and changed her surname to Shen. She still occasionally performed at banquets. The successor to Sulan was Zhou Ruixian, Yan Lizhen. Ruixian became famous for telling the "Romance of Three Smiles," but she could only tell half of it. Lizhen could perform the whole thing. Unfortunately, the orchid was destroyed and the jade broken, and she went to the underworld too soon.</p>
<p>Bamboo Branch Word No. 2 says: "The Romance of Three Smiles lets Ruixian perform, among them Lizhen is more virtuous. Now only Mother Zhou remains, still infatuated with the beautiful women's money." No. 3 says: "Sulan was the old-timer who opened the venue, and the skirt and hat startled everyone for a while. I am embarrassed to talk about leaving the bald story in the wine and flower venue. It is not easy to find ordinary joy." These are all poems for the above three people. These three people were not recorded in the "Ying Ruan Za Zhi." Sulan's deeds are no longer traceable, only a few poems were published in the "Shen Bao" at the time, which can be roughly imagined. Xiang Fu Hong Ao Guoke's "Praise to Zhu Sulan, the Storyteller":</p>
<p>She doesn't wear makeup, she loves light makeup, and she smells fragrant like musk orchids in the wind. The flower farmer listens to fairy music on moonlit nights, and who in the audience doesn't have a broken heart.</p>
<p>Her lifelong skill is the dulcimer, and her ice-like intelligence proves her true heart. She is the best at storytelling, and her singing voice is lingering and childish.</p>
<p>The original poem has eight verses. Only this one is worth referring to. There is also Bai Xia Qingxi Sheng, who wrote "Five Storytellers' Poems," and the second poem is about Zhu Sulan: "How can she be willing to be gentle and swaying like a willow, washing away the makeup and having a special fragrance. It is best for clay figures to listen without getting tired, and the pearl throat and silver armor are the best in storytelling." Wu Xing Renqiu Jushi commented on Sulan as "not painting her eyebrows long." These are all enough to see Zhu Zilan. However, it is inevitable that there were people with the same name at the time, and Wang Tao also recorded that she was "about fifty years old." I don't know if it is the same person. However, since there is no way to disprove it, I can only vaguely preserve it. This is the first female storyteller who started the book apartment.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Encouraging Learning, Agriculture, Storing Talent for the Country, Leaving the Strong, Eliminating the Weak, Selecting Seeds with Fields</p>
<p>At that time, Zhu Airen drove to the Provincial No. 13 Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Farm. The place was quiet, at the foot of a mountain, surrounded by a clear stream. The mountain was called Lu Mountain, and there was a large bamboo forest on it, with an ancient temple hidden in the middle. There was a monk inside, with a follower, who was practicing quietly there. The ancient temple only had a few rooms. Now, although it belonged to the Free Village, the villagers let him be free. At the foot of the mountain, many places were covered with mulberry fields, and the seed manufacturing farm was there. A horizontal road was built from the highway, directly to the seed manufacturing farm. It was built by the seed manufacturing farm, and it was very clean. When they went in, it happened that the director of the farm was at home today. It turned out that the director's surname was Ge, and he was also a silkworm expert. He was also over fifty years old. Director Ge was very happy to see Village Chief Zhu leading several ladies to visit. Besides Village Chief Zhu, Ai Qun also knew him, but Ai Ren had heard of him for a long time, and only met him today. As for the two Miss He, he only knew after Village Chief Zhu introduced them. When he saw Village Chief Mi, he said, "I was originally going to visit the village chief to report some things and to discuss something with the village chief, and ask you, old sir, to help. It's a coincidence that you, old sir, have come, which is even better." Village Chief Zhu asked, "What is it?" Director Ge smiled and said, "I'll slowly tell the village chief in a moment. Aren't these ladies here to visit our farm? It's not the silkworm rearing season now, so there's nothing to see. I can lead them around and take a look." At that time, Director Ge led them around. They first went to the large silkworm rearing room. There were five large silkworm rearing rooms in the whole farm. These houses were all bungalows, specially for silkworm rearing. There were ventilation windows on the top, and wooden floors on the bottom. There were iron screen windows on all sides, so that even the smallest flies and maggots could not get in. The rooms were also equipped with hot steam pipes, because silkworms are also a delicate animal and cannot stand the cold. If the weather suddenly gets cold when they are developing, they will not be able to stand it. At that time, the room must be warm like spring, and radiators must be turned on. Generally, the silkworm room has a certain temperature. Recently, there are thermometers specially for silkworm rooms, which are hung there. When raising silkworms, there is generally a suitable climate, but in addition to spring silkworms, there are also summer silkworms and autumn silkworms, which require certain temperatures, which is more complicated. But these are matters for their experts, and I won't bother you with the details. Someone joked that "in the Han Dynasty in China, there was a person who understood the temperature inside best, that was Sima Qian, the Grand Historian who wrote the Records of the Grand Historian, because he had been to the silkworm room, hadn't he?" This really made people laugh. (151)</p>
<h3>Youth Association Hosts Summer Social for Young People</h3>
<p>— (Yu Xiangzhi)</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, and schools are successively starting summer vacation. These eager students will naturally need places and ways to spend their long vacation. However, the "isolated island" is now developing abnormally. If young people are not careful, they will be forced by boredom to frequent singing and dancing halls and many other inappropriate entertainment venues, living a "summer spring" life. Therefore, the youth department of the Shanghai YMCA is holding a summer social to promote group life during the summer vacation, to develop the physical and mental health of young people, and to cultivate the spirit of the four areas of education (moral, intellectual, physical, and social). The time is from July 1st to the end of August, from noon to 6:00 PM every day. This event provides the general public with a proper way to spend the summer in the depressing "isolated island" summer, which not only benefits individuals, but also benefits society at large. However, because the organizers are from the youth department, the target audience is mainly young people, and young people aged 10 to 16, regardless of gender, can register to participate. Judging from the age, they are probably male and female students in higher elementary and junior high school. Allowing them to avoid those improper amusements, this achievement may even surpass education.</p>
<p>The association has many regulations and entertainment methods: for example, in the games section there is: table tennis, chess, ball games, and other games; in the knowledge section there are: various daily newspapers and magazines; in the social section there are: social gatherings, group games; Chinese and Western singing, chorus; there are also two parts to the lectures, namely science and common sense. The scientific lectures are about engines, radio, airplanes, and poison gas. The common sense lectures are about hygiene, diet, gender, choosing friends, group life, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two types of visits and competitions. The association will contact major factories, institutions, or gardens, etc., and lead participants to visit. The competitions are friendly matches between the games and singing practiced by the participants and groups from outside the association, and there are prizes for the winners.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association's purpose is to serve young people, and there is no charge for participation. However, the quota is only 500 people, and only those who are quick will get in first.</p>
<h3>Ms. Jin Shujuan's Painted Fan</h3>
<p>One of the works in the Amateur Art Writers' Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition</p>
<h3>Dream Lover</h3>
<p>— Ru Hua</p>
<p>"The Shonwarn Angel"</p>
<p>During World War I in 1914, the United States was the last to join the Allied forces to declare war on Germany. Now the world situation has reached the eve of the outbreak of the 1914 war again, and all parties are paying close attention to the attitude of the United States in particular. Although "Dream Lover" is a light-hearted romantic comedy, we can at least see a glimpse of the American attitude from the special preferential treatment and encouragement that the American public gives to soldiers joining the anti-aggression front. After watching this "Dream Lover" full of humor, we cannot ignore the director's efforts in this regard. For example, when Bill was knocked down by Dixie's car, the police saw that Bill was a soldier on his way to war and immediately ordered Dixie's car to take him to his regiment. A soldier who goes to the front line to fight for world peace should be given special respect by the public. Although Dixie had already agreed to marry Sam, she did not want to wound Bill's heart on the eve of his departure, nor did she want to give him the most powerful encouragement. She gained Sam's understanding and married Bill. When dealing with this scene, the director tried to avoid creating the opposite effect in Dixie's painful predicament and Sam's understanding, as if she was only deceiving this honest and kind person to leave New York immediately. And when the news of Bill's death in battle arrived, it was exactly when Dixie was performing in a nightclub, and the repeated singing replaced the desolate atmosphere at the time, which was also a sign of the glory of the dead and the coming of light.</p>
<p>The director also did not allow the progress of the whole play to slacken because it was full of laughter. For example, Bill was in Dixie's room twice, and Bill and Dixie went out together twice. Even Sam's smoking of cigarettes before and after became a strong contrast, and the emotions were very strong.</p>
<p>The scene after Dixie and Bill get married is difficult to handle, because it is already a redundant tail, but this exceeded all the climaxes, and the director achieved excellent results.</p>
<p>James Stewart's Bill, with his honest and innocent behavior, is as successful as the lawyer's assistant in "The Awful Truth". Margaret Sullavan is better at tragedy than comedy.</p>
