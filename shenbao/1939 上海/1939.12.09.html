<h3>日本認識之錯誤</h3>
<p>論「日本認識之錯誤」似為今日報章不亟之務，殊不必更事申論，顧乃猶欲以此為論者：誠以遠東大局演變之慘烈與嚴重，凡有不忍之必者，岡不同深悲憫；固將如何始能從苦惱中求香解脫，泥犂中求得光明？此在日本執持其侵略之下，中國惟有以抗戰得之，亦惟中國由抗戰成功而獨得解脫與光明，故在中國為欣幸而艱苦；此在侵略暴露其崩潰之前，日本誠能悔禍，則中日兩國共得解脫，而其光明且有裨於整個國際。往者，日本如瘋狂，遑論悔禍，故雖指述其認識錯誤，亦屬從為諄；今者，日本有無悔禍之誠，雖待方來之事實跡象為之說明，然察之日本國內最近之與情，則頗有人焉，轉變其數年來乃至數十年來之作風；此雖不足以證明其悔禍，然彼自知絕境，企圖解脫，而猶認識錯誤，誠將自貽伊戚，竊願糾正之。</p>
<p>日方之錯誤認識，例不勝舉，以近日而論，日方一面企謀解脫而一面怨天尤人。為舉一例，以槪其餘。頃據路透電傳，北平之日軍發言人謂英國運用其左右國民政府之力量，以延長中日戰事，消耗日本國力，故主張逐出英國勢力，以保東亞民族之生存。此數言，無一是。蓋自正面消耗日本國力者為中國，中國於日本發動武力侵略之始，即已正告日本，稱抗戰為消耗戰，以消耗日本國力為基本之戰略，為日常之戰術。戰事發動於日本，而助長戰事期間以及日本之消耗量者，乃為對日本繼續不斷供給軍火與軍火原料之各國。日本瘋狂，斯不恤使庫藏黃金，浮海而去；原料之各國。日本瘋狂，斯不恤使庫藏黃金，浮海而去；日本不恤消耗，斯各國供給日本以所願消耗；不自省覺，於人何尤？至於英國勢力，必與其勢力所及之處之民族相依為生；英國若企圖滅絕東亞民族，則於其企圖尚未完成之日，即為英國勢力在東亞顚覆之時；英國在中國之所作為，若與中國民族之生存相背，則英國勢力將無待日本加以驅逐而自絕；雖日本樂為英國勢力作保鏢，亦無濟也。尤錯誤者，以國民政府為英國所左右；以吾人深知確信，英國不能左右國民政府，抑亦絕無他國乃得而左右之。於此必須認識眞切：中國以主權領土之無整，為唯一目標；而侵略之下，尤惟有以抗戰為保持目標之唯一手段。中國在國際，夙以此目標為分別友敵之標準；而二年半以來，則以各國之如何贊助此手段分別友誼之厚薄。目標堅定不拔，絕非英國所得而左右；遑論英國，中國政府而放棄此目標，或折减此目標，将不但不为人民所擁護，尤必为人民怕共棄；易言之，政府之生滅，且以此目標為衡量之具，他國安有左右餘地。目標之下，以手段應付環境，而抗戰即所以適應侵略；他國對中國之所贊助，以及中國所接受之各國贊助，其中必事實為贊助抗戰，而期中心意義還在主權領土之完整；不獲完整，則中國必抗戰到底，友邦必贊助到底，亦中國接受贊助到底；主權領土完整矣，則事實上旣無須抗戰，亦豈有他國能使中國繼續於戰。此中國抗虞與各國贊助之必然界限也，非英國或他國所得左右也。</p>
<p>日本猶有此錯誤認識，於是所以自謀解脫者，非但在識意上自味其眞誠，而錯覺為無可奈何，亦且在方法上輒自陷於歧途，而加重其苦惱。彼聲言驅逐英國勢力　意在威脅英國，取得妥恊，庶幾有利於彼之解脫。英國畏懼威脅與否，甘與妥恊與否，乃別一問題；即使由威脅而妥恊矣，即使由英日妥恊而予中國抗戰以幾分不利矣，然謂中國將因此接受侵略放棄抗戰，則為在所必無。何也，中國政府之生滅，人民之向背，胥以主權領土完整為必要之基礎，亦以中國民族視此為存亡所繫耳；英國對日妥恊與否，何得動搖此基礎。日本威脅英國，乃至近頃陽示聯蘇，聬謀誘美，因果厥同。要知中國雖不無所得於英美蘇諸國之贊助抗戰，然中國抗戰不視禇國意態而屈伸，惟與日本侵略相終始；侵略一日是則抗戰一日，即日本消耗一日，苦惱一日，亦即永無解脫之一日。近日日本數管齊下而無一效者，悔禍之眞誠不足，事理之認識不足，各為原因之半焉。</p>

<h3>分幣劵昨發行　輔幣恐慌已解除　一元法幣亦運到五百萬圓　總結束期輔幣將回歸上海</h3>
<p>中央銀行上海分行為救濟輔幣劵缺乏恐慌起見、經總行核准、第二批分幣劵、已於昨日起逐漸發行、同時運到大批一元劵、由中中交三行儘量供給、調劑市面、所以一元劵輔幣劵分幣劵恐慌、漸告解決、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>二批分劵昨已發行</p>
<p>第二批分幣劵五十萬元、由美商永寗公司承印、第三批分幣劵承印合同、昨已商妥、中央銀行上海分行、於昨日起逐漸發行第二批分幣劵、先發給銀行公會會員銀行四十六家、錢業公會會員錢莊四十二家、每家自一百元至五百元不等、各大公司商號工廠請求領用者頗多、已分別予以審查、俟核定數量後、即行分別通知前往具領、聞四大公司每家先發五百元、昨日總共發出分幣劵約十萬元、</p>
<p>一元劵連滬五百萬</p>
<p>中中交三銀行鑒於上海市場一元劵之缺乏、已將庫存新舊一元劵、儘量供給各銀行錢莊、流通市面、凡銀錢業公會會員行莊、均得向三行申請領用、並有大批一元新劵、係中央銀行版、由英商匯豐銀行運抵上海、目的在調劑市面需要、聞昨日起各行莊向中中交三銀行掉換者甚多、其運到之一元劵、聞有五百萬元、所以此後之一元劵、不致再感受缺乏、</p>
<p>輔幣流入內地甚鉅</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀錢業探悉、自滬市人口加密後、鋼元鎳幣、又絕跡於市、輔幣劵之需要益增、然疊經金融機關隨時增發供給之後、宜可達飽和之程度、惟因內地之需要極殷、輔幣劵由滬市而流往內地者、其數量雖未能統計、然必甚鉅、且必源源不絕、此本埠輔幣劵恐慌久而未乏、歷時已久、惟因內地與滬市之流通、現時較前便利、故現時輔幣之流出日多、而滬市所受影響乃漸著、</p>
<p>商人收貨需要正殷</p>
<p>今淪陷區域之銅元鎳幣、已被錄镕絕跡、即在市流通之輔幣劵、一部份亦難免因流亡遷移而散佚、淪陷區域金融機關、或遷移、或停業、輔幣劵無供給之源、又無集中之所、在商業上使用者、流通之速度降低、則需要之數量目大、況值秋熟登場之候、今歲尚不失為豐稔之年、商人之赴內地收貨者、勢非携帶輔幣劵與俱不可、且內地使用範圍極廣、凡與滬市火車輪舶交通相交接之城市鄉鎮、皆為需要輔幣及輔劵之處所、</p>
<p>總結束期勢必歸回</p>
<p>金融之供求與流通、常視季節為轉移、過去滬市向例、秋季為放款季節、在秋熟登場之時、商人羣赴內地收貨、故輔幣需要增加、於是輔幣流入內地者甚多、一至歲暮總結束期、則放款流回上海、承平時然、今日更在、承平時內地金融機關雖規模較滬市為小、亦能自然為集散之調劑、今則內地金融集中滬市、故供需之關係益密、需要幣劵時、以滬市為泉源、商業總結束時、幣劵必能回歸、集中於滬、</p>
<h3>偽方勒索房捐　英總領提抗議　英僑住居界外任何里弄　斷無向偽財局納稅義務</h3>
<p>英駐滬總領事斐林浦爵士、以滬西區『大道市府』之『財政局』、企圖向該處越界築路地帶之英僑住戶、徵收『房捐』、近且橫加恫嚇、恣意侵擾、住戶不勝苛煩、爰特致文『市長』傅筱庵、提出抗議、據悉該抗議內容、斐總領力指『財政局』稽徵員向英僑收取『房捐』、殊屬不當、嗣後毋論住居滬西越界築路任何里弄之英僑、斷無向『大道市府』納稅之義務、英僑納房捐、應一本已往工部局為之、對六日上午十一時『財政局』稽徵員姚萍·劉永清·兩名、向地豐路C字七號英僑苛虐勒索『房捐』事、該抗議內容、亦有所指出、</p>
<h3>壓抑米價　採緊急措置　成交後出貨三天為限　今日起實行違者嚴懲</h3>
<p>自本市米號業同業公會集議貢獻市場管理委員會、縮短市場成交米糧期限為五日或三日後、復經輿論界一致督促、僉認非如此不足以敉平米價、迄至昨日、此項意見、已經管委會採納、並因昨日米價、又上漲不已、突破紀錄、誠為駭人聽聞、市場管委會特於昨午召開緊急會議、商討換上米價辦法、當決議在市場成交之貨交割日期、以三日為限、並不得退票、自今日起切實執行、</p>
<p>管理委會緊急措置</p>
<p>米市場管理委員會、因米價狂漲、不特影響市民生計、且有碍同業營業、特於昨午假福州路青蓮閣公樣處召開五十五次會議、出席者有符前耕·張利忠·蔡聲明·陸釗鈁·鄭升雲·鍾緒生·顧益生·胡文安·印福祥·葉品珊·楊紹元·徐埜孫·周之楨·王天仇、主席符前耕報告、略調、連日米價狂漲、殊屬不合情理、若不設法補救、後患不堪設想、希各委員共抒意見、設法補救、旋由各委員發表意見、一致認為欲使米價穩定、仍在制止買空賣空、旋即議決成交各貨、出貨期以三日為限、自今日起實行、</p>
<p>規定辦法發出公告</p>
<p>管理委員會於昨日通過決議後、當即發出通告、其內容如下、『本會市場交易、國米本持現買賣、無日期之標準、所定十天期限、係指洋米及客秈而論、但際茲市價混亂之時、成交後之出貨、暫以三天為限、無論客售與行、行售與號、均須遵守其營業範圍、祇許實胃交易、不得買空賣空、倘一經成交、均需使用規定之憑單、方可為正式交易、倘逾期發生悔約、當各提出成交憑證、俾便管理處分、其懲處辦法、小者停止其營業、大者陳總公會取銷其會員資格、客方亦然、之分函各該客幫公會分別處置准、倘若不依上定辦法營業者、概作非法交易、亦照違章論處置、再上項暫定辦法、經十二月八日之第五十五次市場管理委員會公決、准九日起實行、市上在九日以前之交易、仍照向章了結、合兩院制的錄案公告、希各恪遵是要、此佈』</p>
<p>明年來源或可暢通</p>
<p>米價上漲、來源不能暢達、固亦為成因之一、惟最近水陸兩路逐日到滬之米糧、數在六七千包、訂購之貢米、亦間日能到滬一二萬包、在理米價不應再上漲、今反背道而馳、實出意料之外、今大中社記者探悉、自明年一月份起、凡滬地行號客家、前往江浙兩省產米之淪陷區域採辦食米者、不受限制、可儘量運出、惟消息或轉瞬間變耳、</p>
<p>市聯會請維持民食</p>
<p>上海市第一特區市民聯合會、前以米價飛漲、而直接蒙受損害最大者、厥惟升斗之平民、故非特界內民食、發生恐慌、即租界治安、每受鉅大之影響、曾於日前向兩租界當局建議、要求在新榖全場之際、派員向產業儘量採購、運滬設倉儲存、以備調節、而利民生、兩租界當局對此建議、雖曾予以同情、但辦法則未能實踐、引以為憾、茲因連日米市益行混亂、平民生活、更感維持為難、特於昨日再度向兩租界當局籲請、速籌壓平米價之有效方法、俾治安與民食、兩受共利、實有迫切施行之必要、</p>
<p>斛司違約將予嚴懲</p>
<p>前荳米業公會對斛司之扣取力錢、規定為每石一分、其中七釐為在業斛司之斛力、餘三釐則為失業斛司之救濟金、但邇來有業斛司、輒至各米行將失業斛司之三釐救濟金收去、有時則扣去其一釐半、昨日失業斛司某人至米市場向米行同業收取斛力時、被在業斛司攔阻、幾至動武、卒為同業勸開、聞工部局駐米市場監督與市場管委會、對有業斛司違反公會議案、異常注意、若再有此等行為發現、即將予以嚴懲、</p>

<p>停頓業經兩載有餘之浦江疏濬工程、因日方與濬浦局已成立協定、不久即將恢復工作、昨晚經日大使館發言人在新聞報道席上發表稱、『商討經六個月之恢復濬浦工程交涉、因打開今後由何人管理濬浦局之主題難關後、業於十二月一日、由駐滬日本總領事三浦義秋與濬浦局成立協定、嗣後該局之總工程師暨其他重要職位、概由日籍人員担任、該局原有華籍人員、當不予調動、惟『江海關監督』李健南將加入服務至濬浦局一部份之挖泥船隻、日本海陸兩軍、仍將保留使用之權、包括最大之挖泥船建華號在內』、大中社記者特走訪此間外國外交界叩詢意見、據表示稱、『上海濬浦局之重行改組、僅為日人握制上海霸權動向之另一行動而已』、又據航業界消息靈通方面表示、『當『八一三』戰爭時、日方攫去挖泥船隻、認為『戰利品』、迨淞滬戰事終了、日方復藉口軍事行動為理由、拒絕恢復挖泥工作、聽任浦江淤泥日漸澱塞、日方扣去之挖泥船隻、則開赴日輪專航之河道中、作為疏濬淤泥之用、今日方表示仍須保留使用挖泥船之權、即欲繼續為內河內江日輪謀便利也』、</p>

<h3>威海衛路福煦路口　葛樹林遭狙擊　刺客連發二彈均未命中　探捕追擊刺客中彈成擒　流彈死傷共五人</h3>
<p>昨晨九時五十分、福煦路威海衛路英法租界交界處、發生槍擊戰前曾充警官現忽化名充當僞職之河北人葛樹森暗殺案，葛因當時奔避甚捷、倖免受傷、惟探捕追捕行兇者時、行人力五名被流彈擊傷、並兩名因傷在要害、旋即斃命、開槍者亦被逮捕、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>企圖加害</p>
<p>昨晨九時四十分左右葛樹森由福煦路四明村四號寓所外出、步行至福煦路哈同路口、擬在該處搭乘公共汽車、詎正抵達汽車站　突有靑年男子一名、由路旁躍出、袖出盒子砲、向葛射擊、葛平時出入、因其現任「職務」關係、早已隨時戒備、故當時瞥見有人企圖加害、即飛步躱避、</p>
<p>刺客中彈</p>
<p>其時該靑年正以所持盒子砲問葛發出、前後兩響、口中並呼「家讓開」等語、葛當此生死關頭、已飛奔至九三九號屋前躱避、該靑年見形勢緊張、企圖跟踪追擊、時適有兩西捕乘機器脚踏車自東向西巡邏、當至四明里口、猝聞槍聲、乃循聲探索、則見刺客正沿哈同花園邊牆、由西向東、與探捕面對而行、兩西捕當即出手槍向刺客轟擊、而另有兩華捕亦已聞聲趕至、其時路上行人衆多、西捕等乃沿路追捕刺客、直追至福煦路威海衛路口、該處行人較少、兩西捕乃發槍嚇令止步、華捕隨亦帮同追擊、該刺客無法抗拒、旋中彈倒於福煦路威海衛路、</p>
<p>驚悸逃逸</p>
<p>葛樹森昨日衣獺皮領大衣、聞槍聲後、急行躲避、倖免受傷、據悉葛年已五旬、河北省人、身村高大、前曾一度在市公安局充任督察員、中日戰後、葛急忽化名張某、在僞「公安局」充「隊長」、平時常在滬西服務、昨晨離寓外出、聞亦係赴該處辦事、當刺客向葛開槍時、葛佯作倒地、旋即匍匐遁至九三九號、故兩彈均着于該處牆上、葛于驚悸之餘、旋即于西捕追擊刺客時、向威海衛路遁去、</p>
<p>兩死三傷</p>
<p>當西捕追擊刺客時、刺客在槍林彈雨之下、卒被擊中、計頭部兩彈、旋即倒地、其時附近智仁勇女校一帶行人、受流彈擊傷者計五名、經查悉者、有（一）張阿四、（海門人二十八歲住哈同路慈厚南里三十號）傷左脚投紅十字會醫院、（二）人力車夫顧興詩、（江北人四十二歲、）傷右腿、（三）威海衛路太平洋煤店工人潘志海、（寗波人三十五歲）、傷右脚、（四）路過募化和尙傷左胸、分送巡捕寳隆兩醫院救治、（五）一無名形似苦力之男子、下顎中一槍、送抵醫院即斃命、該募化和尙、彈山前腦進、旋亦不治、至該靑年刺客衣人字呢大衣、據聞受傷後、自稱名王三孝、惟詳情尙侍捕房嚴密偵查、</p>

<h3>「歹土」成罪惡淵藪　盜匪白畫橫行　連日盜匪竊案層見迭出　新樓水嚼會鈔竟用手槍</h3>
<p>滬西越界築路捕房警權、遭日僞侵擾後、惡勢力逐漸擴展、造成今日之「歹上」、爲罪惡淵藪、入冬以來、「歹土」一帶、歹徒白晝橫行、刦案層見迭出、該處治安、陷於無法維持之境地、</p>
<p>診病歸來醫生遇盜</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時許、中華醫學會某醫生偕女護士前往白利南路盧薛宅九十三號（該宅曾被僞「自衛團」佔據）慈聯分會第三難民收容所、爲難民等治療疾病、迨事畢返歸時、甫出大門、突遭「歹徒」攔阻、出槍威迫、强將西醫所服大衣及女護士所戴金戒勒下、搶刦後逃逸無踪、該醫生等受此損失、祇有徒呼負負而已、</p>
<p>山芋船主貨款被劫</p>
<p>昨日第二起「歹徒」搶刦暴行、發生於極司非而路三角塲附近在上午十時左右、蘇州河內停有山芋船數艘、該船貨主上岸將所販山芋售與某地貨行後、得款八百餘元、返至船中、突有「歹徒」跟踪而來、即用强暴手段、將該款掃數刦去、事後貨主放聲大哭　一時觀者爲之酸鼻、</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米天天到　米價日日高　茍無制裁操縱之辦法　米價不易有平落之望</h3>
<p>此次米價、復因內地來原　受「統制」之影響、到源突見寥落、激成連朝暴漲、直破四十元大關、若常粳竟達四十五六元、屈指數日之內、無論粳尖、悉已飛漲有六七元之巨、且依漲勢而觀、來源苟無疏通之希望、操縱苟無制裁之辦法、米價恐無平落之可能，在米業祗事宣傳實施業規、種種說法、無非爲其卸責之地步、熟聞生繭、而囤積居奇、操縱如故、昨各路來源、到蘇嘉路一帶貨十三四車、河下靑角貨二三艘、早市開手、一般作客、皆以隔昨之餘波、爭先問津、售方客囤居奇不放、米價節節上升、若常粳曾至四十七八元、崑粳亦至四十六七元、薄稻四十四元、蘆羊尖四十二三元、比前市莫不猛漲二三元之巨、漲則漲矣、終覺近五十元之巨價、將來未免難於脫手、且作客亦感棘手、相率停進、昔之買進者又復乘高賣出、供多求少、各貨行情乃又步步下降一二元左右、收盤常粳四十六元半、崑粳四十五元半、薄稻四十二三元、比前市較增半元至近元、</p>
<p>客秈來源、漸見蟬聯、雖途中稽延與手續麻煩、然販戶以其獲利豐厚、頗多搬運、今後當可源源抵埠、惟昨晨被粳米猛漲與投機在熱之影響行情一度抬高元外、然以洋米軋脚、後市又復回抑、結果祗大半元、高蕪秈則已開出三十九元、</p>
<p>洋米定貨續在接洽中、糧商會有一號四十三四元之電報打出、但洋商則謂貢電報漲、須至四十八九元肯談、因此新交易尙無正式成議、，現西貢早市，客帮鮮有出樣、祗有一般回籠貨一互相授受、市面先後僅有一元上落、初開團粒爲三十九元、三十八元八角、收盤三十八元半、長粒初三十八元半、收盤三十八元二角、三十七元九角、見增三四角至半元而已、</p>
<p>洋米接踵而來、昨日怡和洋行永生輪、自香港運來一萬二千九百二十三包、太古公司太原輪由香港運來一萬三千一百三十四包、共計二萬六千零五十七包、正在起卸中、（祖）</p>
<h3>廠家放盤收小麥　青島用油換麵粉</h3>
<p>麵粉廠盤、經前日一度再漲後、漸趨平和、查近日小麥原料迭見高價、各廠以成本日昂、售價堅持、而客方除南洋去化尙佳外、餘均以價位過高、無和可沾、且如靑島等處、販運原不合算、惟目連油被日方統制以來、祗靑島等地尙能方統制以來、祗靑島等地尙能少數輸出、但亦必須以出口之物、掉進相等貨物、此係某方操祇得以油換粉、故　粉尚人少數去路、其他天津秦皇島等處、亦無熱烈之需要、雖有運往、大非昔比、蓋早已成爲日粉市塲矣、故客銷已不若前兩日之興奮、統市成交約計三萬餘包、本客各半去路、二號粉續開八元三角原盤、回範貨砲車粉則仍須八元六角、日廠粉鳳凰牌十二月份初開一度到過八角三角、旋即回低至一角七八分、龍門牌回籠貨開過七元七角半、市面情勢、似覺平弱、又麵粉今日有七千五百包、運往天津、又五千五百包、運往香港、</p>
<p>小麥市况、再度昂貴、蓋廠胃已實行放價至十三元五角收進、但供應者依然寥落，結果福新祇辦六百包、阜豐祇開三百包、蘇州常州揚州等麥悉開十三元五角、而市塲售開者共有管店麥及蚌埠花麥等十車之數、最高爲十三元六角八分、父創新高價云、</p>
<p>油市昨日尙稱平靜、交易亦稀、惟來源尙不見旺、囤貨不肯輕易出脫耳、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆行囤問津　午後又見回漲</h3>
<p>黃豆市况、晨初因客銷不動、行囤旁觀、本街進胃飽滿、以致市氣平定、午後行囤各帮復來問津、如身燥高品及油廠銷路之各豆、又見上騰、結果提升二三角、刻下大局到銷相埒、底存雖不厚、但來源頗暢旺、昨統市計開丁家州豆六七百包、價自十七元五角至十八元二角半、南京豆四車、價爲十六元八角至十七允三角半、蕪湖豆五百餘包、十六元八九角、蚌埠豆三車十八元至十八元三角、崇明沙黃六百餘包、十七元七角至十八元零二分、平湖杜豆五十包、十八元七角半、</p>
<p>九日運香港豆子五千九百六十八包、生仁九百八十包、生油二千七百八十五　、麻油五百六十聽、又八日由寗波運來皮油六百聽、</p>
<h3>金融　金市多頭　獲利出籠</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、因匯市略定、致當日形勢亦隨之稍平、惟上數日一貫買入之某錢兌業、復來獲利出籠、其數竟有一千幾百兩之夥、而多方逢小仍不時加碼、故結果祇回落十元、前途或暫有參差可能、然無慘落之虞、論當日經過、則晨開不動、仍爲四千」百八十元、繼會拉起五元、嗣以某錢兌業代大戶獲利不斷吐出、且其時外匯帶硬、雖證券帮等各帮尙有納胃、終感貿遜於賣、一度曾退達四千一百三十元低價、後幸匯市轉軟、且聞匯豐吃進、買風四起、某金號與散戶等紛紛入市竸賣、故曾好達四千一百九十元、奈好景不常、午刻外匯轉平、一時搶風頭之買戶頓來復吐、迄至午收祇告四千一百七十元、午後因匯市呆定、上落極形平淡、結果與午收相仿、全天交易暢旺、的二千七八百兩、銀樓飾余掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤回跌十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開因匯市報平、致局勢尙形和緩、首由錢兌業進金號一十兩、爲四千一百八十元、較上日未分榮辱、少頃證券帮稍來撈入、拾起五元、進現金號十兩、爲四千一百八十五元、嗣以某錢兌業代大戶出籠、爲數不少、且一時進戶納胃呆滯、一霎那即猛撳三十五元、錢兌業售予銀樓帮三十兩、爲四千一百五十元、後某銀號代客戶收買、且賣者暫停、遂回起二十元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲四千一百七十元、此後某錢兌業又起賣風、祇塞出百兩、而價已撳小至四千一百五十五元、其時另一錢兌業納　轉旺、而證券帮亦有跟進、故又見回升二十元、達四千一百七十五元、旋以某錢兌業再來猛塞、滙市亦報帶硬、遂冉慘落四十五元、錢兌業吐予金號一十兩、爲四千一百三十元、十一時許、外匯突然轉軟、一時買者四起、瞬息即跳高十八元、後加某金號及證劵帮與散戶等競買、再抬起四十餘元、證劵帮進某錢兌業五十兩、及錢兌業五做二十兩、均爲四千一百九十元、午刻外匯轉平、買風亦息、一般搶帽子之多戶趁高出籠、同時某金號亦獲利晚手、不久即降落三十元、金號互做十兩、爲四千一百六十元、將沂收盤時、某錢兌業復來喊買、未幾即抬起十元、錢兌業互做　兩、爲四千一百七十元作午收價、午後初開錢兌業續來抬　、開市高起十元、錢兌　進金號一十兩、爲四千一百八十元、後某錢兌業轉懷賣意、復吐數十兩、目銀樓帮亦稍塞出、步降十五元、某錢兌業吐予證券帮十兩、爲四千一百六十五元、其時證券帮繼續撈入、遂再好至四千一百八十元、，入後因金號與某銀號吐出、重小爲四千一百六十元、後另一證券帮入市吸收、遂高起五元、證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、爲四千一百七十元作晚收價、結果比上日回跌十元、全天六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高元、收進的减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百二十五元、迨十時許掛小五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸四百二十元、新同行與上價相同、收進均减小十五元光景、</p>
<h3>滙市徘徊　港帮出英進美</h3>

<h3>評「辭源正續編合訂本」</h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<p>辭源正續二編自出版以來，風行各地，早有定評。最近又縮小字體，放大版式，加註總頁碼，集合訂正，合三大冊爲　冊；檢查携帶，均感便利。</p>
<p>但既有這一次合訂之舉，我覺得先前似乎還有一次嚴格訂正的需要，現在離二續辭源的出版期恐怕尙遠，這合併的機會倒也很可利用一下，使二續辭源編印的時候省一點氣力，同時我們在二續辭源出版以前的幾年中也早可以得到一本完善的定本。所以略有瑕疵之處如「東山再起」，「居里夫人」等的缺如，申一四頁言「茨藻」是「藻類植物」的錯誤，以及子二頁「一臠」引典於魏書的太遲（如以「呂氏春秋」爲「　」，「淮南子」中亦有）等，似乎該在這一次裏訂正增補的。</p>
<p>據「合訂本說明」裏說這一次的合訂，不但是簡單的併合，正文一部中並兼有「漏字」之「補足」，「錯誤」之「訂正」，「文句」之「改纂」，「名辭」之「修正」，後二者在厚厚一冊的辭源合訂本中，要找它實在也很不容易，所以怎樣的文句才須改纂，改纂的標準如何；怎樣的名辭才須修正，修正的標準如何；我們也無從知道。不過我覺得有些較大而牽動兩條或兩條以上的地方似乎也需要改纂和修訂一下，這些從好幾個例子看來是未曾改訂過的。</p>
<p>第一：續編中「補充」正編同一意義之辭語者，應併入相當普遍之條目下，而另一條目下註「詳見某條」字樣。如「胡瓜」可併入「黃風」之類是。</p>
<p>第二：異條目而同典者可廢其一而代以「詳見某條」之註。如午一九頁之「琢釘」（本在續編）司併入申一一三頁之「覆巢無完卵」（本在正編）；申六頁之「虀臼」（本在續編）可併入亥六七頁之「黃絹幼婦」（本在正編）。酉一四四頁之「重錳酸鉀」（本正）酉一〇八頁之「　錳酸鉀」（本正）以及亥二〇頁之「高錳酸鉀」（本續）原屬一物，而各條目下所述則微有出入，頗費初學者之索解。又「高錳酸鉀」下並註見「重錳酸鉀」條，而不註見「過錳酸鉀」條。「重」「過」二條下之無見「高」，亦可想而知。如此類之條目均宜加併，自不待言。即不能併之本在正編條下而與續編條有關者，亦應添註見某條，使成「互」見，方爲週到。</p>
<p>生物學名辭中之關分類學者，正編均不註西名，續編則均加註，合併後頗不一律，似爲一缺點。如正編之有吻類，有尾類，有袋類，與續編之有爪類，有足類，有板類，有肺類，有翅類，有管類，有錐類，顯然可辨。綱目科屬之名不若種名。種的西名常見者省去尙無多大關係，綱目科屬之名則似以一律看待爲宜。</p>
<p>附帶提到的，辭源最好加一音譯對照表，俾免欲查外國人名地名而不知首字如何譯法之苦。因近來各書用到外國人名地名時，旁多加註，且譯者因此亦隨意轉譯，不求精細。固不若辭源初出版時之情况也。</p>
<p>總之，辭源正續編在戰時狀態下有這一次的合訂和出版，已屬難得。同時要像我所奢望的各點那樣，幾同重編，在這時候恐怕還做不到，所以這本辭源正續編合訂本只像它名稱所指的「合訂本」，是正續編混合物而不是它們的化合物。</p>
<h3>打前站——湘北會戰追記</h3>
<p>— 芬郞</p>
<p>因爲戰局形勢的緊急，旅司令部又奉命增派兩團的兵力開往前綫增援去。而且，王旅長還指派我當這一次「打前站」的差使，我連忙奔到駐紮在鄕間的團部裏，傳達了這個急令，可巧團長又在外面操練，我不再躭擱，就和徐團附商量一下子後，決定今晚八時起拔趕過葫蘆山而抵達長沙。預備等待到了長沙以後，再候旅司令部的命令開拔前綫去。</p>
<p>吃過晚飯以後，我到外面找了兩倘挑夫來，挑了兩担的手溜彈，起程趕向葫蘆山去，不多遠的後面，緊隨着一支鐵血融成的洪流。——二千多個弟兄——我的手裏燃了一束的小火把，發出一些微弱的光芒，照着那迂迥的山路，放開脚步死勁地走，我們又投向陰森森的山谷中來了。</p>
<p>偶然回過頭來，在一片黑鬱鬱的崖石間閃爍着幾千百道淡淡的手電光，彎彎曲曲的往那邊環繞到這邊。從叢林裏透漏下來一些脚步聲的碎屑，沙沙地交合着山坡上滑下來的夜風，一起奔向遙遠的山谷。</p>
<p>兩個挑夫的步子非常大，有時候我簡直趕不上，我帶着兩隻臃腫僵直的腿，勉强撇開步子在山腰裏走着。驀然間透來一陣劇烈的回響，我知道這是條黑洞洞的深谷，便更小心翼翼的行進，巖崖上，長滿了蘚台，滑溜溜的，好像千萬年沒有哂過太陽；我們急行的脚步，不得不改爲爬行了。</p>
<p>我似乎很疲乏，問了一下挑夫：</p>
<p>「這見到長沙，該有多少路呢？」</p>
<p>「沒有多路了，朝道山路走，過了幾個山崖，下坡時，就可望見長沙城的燈火了。」</p>
<p>挑夫說話的音調很響亮，我知道他一定沒有點倦意的，從火把的暗淡光亮裏，隱約可以看見他一副精神百倍的險色。</p>
<p>爬過一座山崖，又奔進了一個山凹，從樹林裏，從岩石間，閃過了我的那束小火把，我們又轉入另一個山崖裏了。這時候，大家都不願意說話，祇是扔動兩隻腿子死勁地走，像那些不受覊勒的野馬向無邊的空闊中奔逗。</p>
<p>橫過這座山崖，就看見山路漸漸傾斜起來，剛剛轉過山脚，，遠遠便看到一點在閃晃着的燈火。</p>
<p>「那兒該是長沙城吧！」我心上這麼地想，三步併作兩步的趕上了挑夫。</p>
<p>天光漸曙，我們連隊伍都趕到了長沙城裏的軍部中報到；我也和兩個挑夫交去了「打前站」的差使，挑夫將手溜彈箱從肩頭放下以後，我便問他</p>
<p>「這打前站的玩兒够累不够累呢？」</p>
<p>「一點也感不到什麼，反而身子爽快了許多，」挑夫又聳了一聳肩膊，還夾着他倆好久沒聽過的嘿嘿的笑聲。</p>
<h3>正義的美</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>美是不是獨立的呢？依克羅齊派的見解，自然認美是絕緣的，無所爲而爲的一種觀賞，一種渾然的直覺，「深心主卉木，遠致極風雲」，祇要牠本身的意象由一個適宜的形式傳導出來，使你眈於直覺境中，都無非是美。這錯誤顯然是漠視藝術的社會性；不知道藝術的美是建立在社會整體的基礎上，你要用刀用剪子去分割，根本不可能。藝術的存在不是你的我的，也不是超然於社會之上的「超人」「超物」，牠是一個社會通體的共鳴，像空氣中的音波或熱的傳導。你說是獨立嗎？刹那間的存在確然是絕緣的，然而我們决不能說不落言筌的渾然意象，就已完成美的能事，重要的美的價値還是需要落言筌，有形式，得使空間廣闊時問悠久的藝術，這縐是眞美。那麼立刻社會的條件跟着來了；美就欣賞本身言，固然絕緣，可是就牠的存在條件說，却還脫離不開社會整體的連繫。</p>
<p>文學爲道德的附庸說可不贊成，但最高藝術的美即爲正義，這句話是應該同意的。依揚雄和曹植的見解，他們都把藝術的美看得太玩忽了，一個說、雕蟲小技，壯夫不爲一，一個說「未足以揄揚大義，昭示來世」。結果他們眼中的美便眞成了桃核舟或是象牙上的蠅頭細刻，專供人戲玩摩挲。一辭代之徵，文章匿而采」，除了新奇漂亮以外，便一無所有。果眞這樣，自然壯夫不爲，也無足怪了。然而我們要問：這種藝術的美果然是眞美嗎？可憐得很，這種東西那配稱一種美！眞正有價値的美，牠必須是動的，蓬勃有生氣的，代表正義的意向。藝術的發源不管怎麼說都好，但先有勞動而後有藝術是實。蠻荒中披荊斬棘的開拓，狩獵的角逐，圖騰與圖騰間的戰爭，這都說明完成生命的奮鬬。從古到今，生命的潛力，一直跟着文學演變的潮流隱伏着，這潛力支配着人類一切複雜的情緒。不管是浮現在波浪表面或是翻進漩渦底層，牠都不會是死的，靜的，除非這時代已死，已靜。</p>
<p>動了，有生氣了，這還不够，進一步須要正義的動。邪惡的猖獗和劍拔弩張，未始沒有動，沒有生氣，然而這不是美。健全的藝術品决不容許牠的攙人。健全藝術的美完全寄託在時代的同感上，除掉現實的美醜外，我們應該更有一種想像的美醜，經過兩者的交融，對於現實的社會便有了一種更確切的估價，進善貶惡，在不知不覺間藝術實已完成了最高的指示與象徵。這指示和象徵便是一種美，—正義的美。這說法對於克羅齊派，幷不衝突，在欣賞間絕緣依然存在，然而牠結果眞成為「典論」中所說「經國之大業，不朽之盛事」了。時間與空問的偉大，這是眞正的偉大。</p>
<p>藝術的美是有道德性的，雖然自始牠本意不在說敎。你懂得這一句意思，那麼我可以具體的指出正義的美是怎樣的存在法。就形式言，這近似「文心雕龍」所說的「風骨」。「結言端直，則風骨成焉」，「端直」不就是正義的美反映在形式的象微嗎？牠和裴子野「雕蟲論」所抨擊的前宋文學恰恰相反，是：「其興沉，其志强，巧而能要，隱而能深一。牠的偉大處，除表露原始來人類蓬勃的動力外，更能樹立一個崇高的合理準則，直接間接有千頭萬緒的情感都受這偉大的潛力支配着，影響着，無形中有一種威嚴，不可更易的意象和定識，得尋於句裏行間，具體點說，這不妨稱爲風骨。風骨是象微正義的美冉好不過的東西了。</p>
<p>描寫花草底美麗嗎？歌頌象牙之塔嗎？色情的美，閒雅的美，……我們大可以擱筆了。讓那數千年來隱伏在　渦下的疾流翻騰到江面上來，變成波濤，樹立崇高的風骨，這纔是眞美，偉大的，正義的。美不必他求，佛羅培爾吿訴我們：「這不外乎正義。」</p>
<h3>臨陣壯語</h3>
<p>— Byron著　品品譯</p>
<p>戰士與官長！要是長矛與利劍刺到我，</p>
<p>當我領民衆去衝鋒的時候，</p>
<p>別顧慮你脚卜的我底屍首，雖然我是領袖：</p>
<p>把你們的兵器挿在國土裏來發誓！</p>
<p>假使，拿着我底盾我底弓，</p>
<p>你們身爲我的同志而臨陣睨逃，</p>
<p>你們就把我刴了吧！</p>
<p>我一向使敵人望風披靡的。</p>
<p>向別人道別吧，但我們永不背離，</p>
<p>你們是我光榮的繼承者，我赤心的兄弟們！</p>
<p>國運昌隆，國威四佈，</p>
<p>要自矢光榮地成仁，在今天！</p>

<h3>陳查禮的煩惱</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>頑皮孩子—自動組偵緝隊</p>
<p>各處活動—人們不堪其擾</p>
<p>好萊塢十餘年前盛行福爾摩斯的偵探片，近來已轉爲陳查禮的時代。陳查禮是個中國名字，他的面貌和作風也是東方化的。以扮演大偵探陳查禮聞名的，初時有華納夏能，很能轟動一時。不幸華氏年前暴病逝世，影壇大爲失望。廿世紀福斯公司不久又物色到了一個新陳查禮」一名席納吐婁（Sidney　Toler），上了幾次鏡頭，居然有許多男孩子，宛如我國孩子的迷於武俠劍客一般，都要拜他做「老頭子」，學習偵探技術。鬧得鼎沸的，要推火奴魯魯島的一羣頑皮孩子，他們自動組織了一個「小陳查禮偵緝隊」（Charlie　Chen　Junior　Police），把大陳查禮捧爲名譽隊長。他們便肩了脾子，到各處探問消息，偵察材料，把偵查經過向陳查禮提出詳細報吿書。這些小陳查禮做事太認眞，遇到認爲疑難的案件不惜觸破人們的車胎，擊碎商店的玻瑙窗，也有時弄壞人家的電話綫，以求水落石出，事畢之後都做了一個「陳查禮查訖」的記號。人們不堪其擾，紛紛向陳查禮責問，每星期有幾起，陳查禮想要辭去名譽隊長的頭銜，又恐怕影響令譽；長此下去，又怕闖下大禍，竟感到相當的煩惱。</p>
<h3>出演天蟾作罷　趙金蓉候輪北返</h3>
<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>趙金蓉輟演更新以後，時已兼旬，更新第一批京角，梁韻秋吳素秋陳少霖等，均已先後北返，惟金蓉則至今仍滯留海上。最近傳出消息，金蓉將於日內在天蟾舞台作短期演出，該台並邀妥鬚生王淸塵小生周筱芳與趙合作云云，記者以事出有因，一昨特訪金蓉於愚園路庽次，對即日出演天蟾之事有所垂詢。但金蓉完全否認，據稱天蟾方面，確曾派人與之接洽，惟本人係更新舞台所邀來，雖已的滿，仍未便另搭別班，加以其他關係，乃加以謝絕。是故外間盛傳金蓉將在天蟾登台之說，乃不克實現之事也。</p>
<p>又訊，趙金蓉原定俟王玉蓉期滿後，應冀平會館救濟委員會及上海難民救災會之請，在黃金大戲院演義務戲三天，戲碼並已內定爲「碧玉簪一「玉堂春」「四郞探母」，茲悉余蓉因已謝絕天蟾之請，對黃金之三塲義務戲，亦表示不再參加。聞金蓉以來滬已久，歸心似箭，已定本月中旬搭順天輪北返，黃金之新角葉盛蘭貫盛習等人，即搭順天南來，該輪大的十四日抵埠，十六日起椗，金蓉在滬僅有一週之勾留，即將買棹北返也。</p>
<h3>高爾基童年　—不日在滬公演</h3>
<p>高爾基氏逝世已經三年，蘇聯爲紀念這位偉大的作家，在電影方面決定把幾部高氏的名著搬上銀幕。</p>
<p>在以前，「母親」已經拍過一次默片。「二十一男和一女」，「夜店」等凖備拍攝而沒有完成。現在拍的，有他的劇本「仇人」和高氏三部曲。高氏三部曲是「我的童年」，「在人間」，「的大學」。</p>
<p>「我的童年」用「高爾基童年」的名稱，已定十三日起在大上海大戲院開映，這對於敬愛高氏的人，該是一個可貴的機會。</p>
<p>舞團寫影</p>
<h3>雜誌　（一）</h3>
<p>— 小田</p>
<p>喜臨門位於靜安寺路西摩路轉角，內闢三部：前爲舞塲，中爲茶室，後爲花園。舞池作長方形，頗形狹小，同時有十餘對偕舞，已嫌擁擠，四壁繪裸體美女畫十餘幅（五四），殆即該廳廣吿所謂裸宮春色者也。音樂爲六人隊，五男一女，與大舞塲較，別有風格。舞女的三十餘人，殊鮮佳麗，嘗見某報譽揚一李亞萍。友人某，頗有問鼎之意，詢之小郞，所指一姝，容色身材，與報載無一可相彷彿。飲料之劣，無與倫比，茶葉均帶梗，咖啡更不堪入口，余意其比鄰之飛達，咖啡紅茶，咸極精美，售價咖啡祗五角，紅茶四角，該廳不妨購諸其鄰而倍値出售，則於人於己，兩俱相宜，商諾小郞，則堅執不可，余等一行乃不得不打道回衙矣。</p>
<p>大都會茹愛娜，近日時同晚食，愈熟愈覺其少舞女習氣，某名律師，近亦常令伴舞，據茹云：其所稔客，均無邪思，是可貴也。余謂女子而鬻色相以餬口，已甚不幸，務宜力趨上流，其法惟日與上流人處，耳濡目染，久之目成自然，所謂入芝蘭之室，久而不聞其香也。顧天紅操吳儂軟語，身長玉立，笑靨迎人，氣息亦頗上流。余語大都會執事，此姝日久必紅，愼勿爲他家奪去也。</p>
<p>在麗珍息影舞榭，已歷年餘，麗都有朱珊珊者，與在稱莫逆交，日前伴客坐檯，雙睫紅腫如胡桃，問之，則述汪圖投浦自盡事，兎死狐悲，物傷其類，蓋曾一掬同情之淚矣。在昔伴舞璇宮，明眸皓齒，爛縵天眞，歌喉嘹亮，吐字淸晰，堪稱後起之秀。後聞名葩移植禁苑，且已弄瓦；今幸遇救無恙，閨闥之事，未可篡述。然小姑娘性情褊狹，苟非放蕩難馭，當令多讀書善遇之耳。</p>
<h3>在「中國之鏡子」裏的戲劇家（四）　—梅邊雜憶之七</h3>
<p>— 李斐叔</p>
<p>「崩」的一響，好似開香檳酒時，瓶的塞子躍出於瓶口之聲，這是另外一個關史，用剪子把這「馬口鐵」箱子外緊束的繩索剪斷之時。箱子打開了！第一個觸進眼簾的，是一件皮衣。問余此衣之價格，余以實價答之。他非但有懷疑之意，而且還認爲余所告之價格，太低賤得出乎常情，他手持此皮衣，遍詢其他關吏，大家的答復，似曰：「有考慮之必要」，此時我祗得等候他們的「質難」了，忽然間有一人，瞥見一白色大信封，壓藏於箱子之底。羣趨而前，其形狀，如飢餓已久之一羣野獸，發現了牠們的食糧一般，急取出啟視之，則一「神采翩翩之美少年」，宛然在焉。余亦若有所恃者然！急吿之曰：「梅蘭芳！梅蘭芳！彼爲誰？汝　常知之！此白色信封之內，除此像片暨其親筆所簽之字外，別無他物也。」</p>
<p>此時許多關吏，其兇橫可怖之面目，立刻改變爲笑容可親之態度了，與先前完全變兩樣了，「幫助我重行摺疊皮衣之人」，就是「剛才與我斤斤較量皮衣價格之人」。他現在對於皮衣價格的問題，譚也不譚了，其餘的行李，也不檢騐了，並立即放還給我一張：「可直達波蘭國境的行李單」。</p>
<p>以一個中國戲劇的器皿，他竟能使經過此地的困難完全取消，使剛才檢查之關吏的「冷淡言語」與「幾笑神情」，一變爲「點頭示敬」，嗣余回至月臺之時，且有幾個中國的兵士來衛護，一邊走，一邊頻頻問訊：「梅氏的近况若何？這一次曾經看過幾次梅氏的戲？我此時之心上，乃發生一問題？就是：「試問在歐美各國，何處更有一舞台上的藝人，而能使受到嫌疑之旅客，一變而爲警察護送之貴賓乎」？（完）</p>

<h3>影迷寫給陳雲裳的信</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>在好萊塢，不拘是男女，成了明星之後，便會每天接到不少影迷的來信。綠衣人到來，總是厚厚的一疊，全是影迷們打全個美國，乃至世界各地寄去的信。好萊塢的大明星是這樣中國的明星也不例外，時常有影迷寫信去的。不過信件的數字，當然遠沒有美國明星的多而已。這裏，我們要一說的，是影迷寫給陳雲裳的信。</p>
<p>陳雲裳在今日，已成了中國唯一的女明星，奪得了當年胡蝶，阮玲王一般女星的寳座之後，中國各地的影迷，就時常寫信給她，不是恭維她，就是要問她討照片。</p>
<p>不但是中國各地，就是菲律濱，馬來，澳洲等處，那些地方時常有中國的影片在公映，所以也有不少人會寫信給陳女士，內中尤其是華僑佔據了寫信者的大半。</p>
<p>自陳雲裳主演的一木蘭從軍」一片，在美國公映而後，「陳雲裳」這三個字，就印上了好多美國影迷的腦膜。而結果，每一班外洋輪船自美國開到中國，凖會有大批信件，送到陳女士拍戲的影片公司中去，全是美國影迷寫來的。美國影迷寫信給陳女士，唯一的原因，是看了「木蘭從軍」之後，很崇拜她的藝術，所以寫信來向她索取照片或親筆的中國字簽名，以作紀念。</p>
<p>陳女士爲處理多量的影迷的來信起見，家裏僱有一個中英文兼長的女秘書，年齡也與她相若。要是自己有聞，一部份信件由她自己作復，如果在拍戲，那回信的工作就由那女秘書處理了。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army Captures Zhao'an and Reaches Fenshuiguan: No Trace of the Enemy in the Border Area Between Fujian and Guangdong; Chao'an City in Eastern Guangdong Also Recovered by the Chinese Counter-Attack; Chinese Forces Launch an Attack on Datangxu on Both Sides of the Yongqin Road</h3>
<p>Fuzhou: Last month on the 17th, the Japanese troops from Chenghai in eastern Guangdong, along with several thousand troops from the puppet bandit Huang Leiwei's unit, harassed the Fujian border in two routes. They were heavily annihilated by the Chinese forces at Huanggang Fenshuiguan and other places. The Japanese and puppets then disturbed Zhao'an on the 1st of this month. After reinforcements from the Chinese army and a counter-attack, fierce battles unfolded in the suburbs. The fighting continued until around 3 a.m. on the 6th, when the Chinese forces broke into the city walls. The Japanese and puppets resisted stubbornly, but the Chinese officers and soldiers fought bravely, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. By 1 a.m. on the 7th, Japanese corpses were scattered throughout the streets, and they fled towards the Shiting area. Currently, the Chinese army is pacifying the people on one hand and pursuing the remaining Japanese on the other. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fuzhou: After the Chinese army recovered Zhao'an at noon on the 7th, they continued to pursue the defeated Japanese troops towards Fenshuiguan. Battles occurred along dozens of miles, annihilating many. The Japanese retreated towards Chenghai. The Chinese army arrived at Fenshuiguan this morning and has made contact with the counter-attacking forces in Guangdong. The small number of Japanese troops who landed at Gongkou near the coast of Zhao'an last night were also driven out completely by the Chinese forces. Currently, there is no trace of the enemy in the southwestern corner of Fujian and the border area between Guangdong and Fujian. The Japanese and puppet forces that invaded this time numbered over two thousand. After being severely attacked by the Chinese forces, they suffered extremely heavy casualties. The Chinese forces are currently assessing the battle results. When Zhao'an was captured, the number of Japanese and puppets captured alive by the Chinese forces reached as many as sixty or seventy. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fuzhou: News came from the Fujian-Guangdong border this afternoon that the Chinese army had captured Zhao'an. The counter-attacking forces launched another fierce attack on Zhao'an city last night, and after a night of fierce fighting, they broke into the city this afternoon and bravely charged and killed. The Japanese forces suddenly collapsed and fled in large numbers towards Jiujin Mountain and Zhuxi Ridge south of Fenshuiguan. The Chinese forces took advantage of the situation to intercept and kill them. Japanese corpses were left all along the way, and casualties were extremely heavy. The Chinese army entered the city at noon and immediately cleared the battlefield, dividing their forces to pursue the retreating enemy. At 2 p.m., two or three Japanese planes flew into the skies over Zhao'an and dropped bombs. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: At dawn on the 6th, the Chinese army launched a two-pronged counter-attack on Chao'an city, engaging in a bloody battle with over a thousand Japanese troops for three hours.

<p>Guilin: The Chinese army has been attacking Qinxian Xiaoying for days, achieving many victories. The Japanese, in a state of panic, transferred some troops from Pumiao in Yongcheng to reinforce Xiaoying. In addition, over a thousand troops were transported by Japanese warships to reinforce Qinxian. Moreover, the highway north of Qinxian has been repeatedly damaged by the Chinese army. About three hundred Japanese tanks and armored vehicles are currently blocked in Qinxian and unable to move north. (8th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Rumors of the Chinese Army Recovering Qinxian County</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A reporter from the Central News Agency called a senior official on the evening of the 8th to inquire about the war situation in Nanning. According to him, the Japanese troops advancing from north of Yongning have been trapped in the middle of the Yong-Wu lines by Chinese forces attacking from both ends. The Chinese frontline troops at Kunlun Pass and Gaofengao are holding firm and have launched the most powerful counter-attacks against the Japanese in the past two days. The Japanese frontline forces have indeed begun to collapse. He also stated that according to reports from the front, there are rumors that the Chinese army has recovered Qinxian. In summary, the Chinese forces in the south are launching strong attacks to remotely control Nanning, while the forces in the north are blocking the enemy's advance. It is believed that the Chinese army will soon be able to defeat the Japanese army. (8th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Errors in Understanding</h3>
<p>Discussing "Japan's Errors in Understanding" seems unnecessary for today's newspapers, as it has already been extensively discussed. However, I still want to address this issue because the tragic and severe evolution of the Far East situation causes deep sorrow for all who have compassion. How can we seek relief from suffering and find light in the darkness? Since Japan insists on its aggression, China can only achieve this through resistance. Only when China succeeds in its resistance can it achieve its own liberation and enlightenment. This is a joyous but arduous path for China. Before aggression exposes its own collapse, if Japan sincerely repents, both China and Japan can achieve liberation, and its enlightenment can benefit the entire international community. In the past, Japan was like a madman, not even considering repentance. Therefore, even pointing out its errors in understanding was merely a form of exhortation. Now, whether Japan has the sincerity to repent remains to be seen through future facts and signs. However, observing the recent sentiments within Japan, some people seem to be changing their ways of the past few years, even decades. This is not enough to prove its repentance, but it shows that it is aware of its desperate situation and seeks liberation. If it still misunderstands, it will only bring trouble upon itself. I sincerely hope to correct its errors.</p>
<p>There are countless examples of Japan's erroneous understanding. Recently, Japan has been seeking liberation on one hand while blaming others on the other. To illustrate with one example, it can be generalized to the rest. According to a Reuters report, the Japanese military spokesperson in Beiping claimed that Britain is using its influence to manipulate the National Government of China to prolong the Sino-Japanese War and deplete Japan's national strength. Therefore, it advocates expelling British influence to protect the survival of the East Asian people. None of these statements are true. It is China that is directly depleting Japan's national strength. From the beginning of Japan's armed aggression, China has explicitly stated that its resistance is a war of attrition, using the depletion of Japan's national strength as its basic strategy and daily tactic. The war was initiated by Japan, and it is the countries that continue to supply Japan with arms and ammunition that are prolonging the war and increasing Japan's consumption. Japan is acting like a madman, sparing no expense to send its gold reserves overseas. Japan does not care about consumption, so various countries supply Japan with what it wants to consume. Why blame others instead of reflecting on oneself? As for British influence, it must coexist with the people in the areas where its influence extends. If Britain attempts to exterminate the East Asian people, then the moment it attempts this, British influence in East Asia will collapse. If Britain's actions in China are contrary to the survival of the Chinese people, then British influence will be eliminated without Japan's intervention. Even if Japan is willing to be a bodyguard for British influence, it will be of no use. What is even more erroneous is to consider the National Government as being manipulated by Britain. We deeply and firmly believe that Britain cannot manipulate the National Government, nor can any other country. It is crucial to recognize that China's sole objective is the integrity of its sovereignty and territory. Under aggression, resistance is the only means to maintain this objective. China has always used this objective as the standard for distinguishing friends from enemies in the international community. In the past two and a half years, it has used the extent of each country's support for this means to distinguish the depth of friendship. This objective is unwavering and cannot be manipulated by Britain. Let alone Britain, if the Chinese government were to abandon or diminish this objective, it would not only fail to gain the support of the people, but would also be abandoned by them. In other words, the survival and demise of the government depend on this objective. How can other countries have room to manipulate it? Under this objective, means are used to adapt to the environment, and resistance is the way to adapt to aggression. The support that other countries provide to China, and the support that China accepts from other countries, must in fact be support for resistance. The core meaning still lies in the integrity of sovereignty and territory. If integrity is not achieved, then China will resist to the end, friendly countries will support to the end, and China will accept support to the end. Once sovereignty and territory are complete, there is no need for resistance in fact, and no other country can force China to continue the war. This is the inevitable boundary between China's resistance and other countries' support. It cannot be manipulated by Britain or other countries.</p>
<p>Japan still holds these erroneous understandings, so its attempts to seek liberation are not only self-deceiving in terms of understanding, mistaking it for helplessness, but also often leading it down the wrong path in terms of method, thus exacerbating its suffering. It claims to expel British influence, intending to threaten Britain and obtain a compromise that would benefit its liberation. Whether Britain fears the threat or is willing to compromise is another matter. Even if a compromise is reached through threats, even if the Anglo-Japanese compromise is somewhat detrimental to China's resistance, it is impossible for China to accept aggression and abandon resistance because of this. Why? Because the survival and demise of the Chinese government, and the support of the people, are based on the integrity of sovereignty and territory. The Chinese people view this as a matter of survival. Whether Britain compromises with Japan or not cannot shake this foundation. Japan's threats to Britain, and its recent attempts to ally with the Soviet Union and conspire to entice the United States, have the same outcome. It should be known that although China benefits from the support of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries in its resistance, China's resistance does not depend on the attitudes of these countries. It ends only when Japan's aggression ends. Aggression exists for one day, and resistance exists for one day. This means that Japan will suffer consumption for one day, suffering for one day, and will never find liberation. Recently, Japan's multiple efforts have failed because its sincerity for repentance is insufficient and its understanding of the principles is insufficient. Each of these contributes half the reason.</p>

<p>Tokyo: It was revealed here today that the Japanese Army Ministry's regular and special budget for next year totals 6,000,000,000 yen. However, the Ministry of Finance has reduced it to 4,400,000,000 yen. It is now known that the Army Ministry is demanding the restoration of the original amount. According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun's" prediction, the Army Ministry's budget can be compromised at around 4,900,000,000 yen. The cabinet is scheduled to consider the draft budgets of the various administrative ministries except for the Army, Navy, and Finance Ministries today, which are estimated to total 1,770,000,000 yen, an increase of 399,000,000 yen compared to this year.

<h3>The U.S. Will Decide Its Attitude Based on the Outcome of the Tokyo Talks; American Arms Dealers Are Only Interested in Profit; Italian Reporter Also Writes an Article Criticizing This</h3>
<p>Washington: Well-informed sources stated today that the prospects for a swift and satisfactory commercial treaty between the United States and Japan are not promising. Washington officials declined to comment on the situation of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty and the announcement by Undersecretary of State Welles in November that the abolished treaty would not be reinstated. Secretary of State Hull yesterday refused to endorse the Grew-Nomura talks being held in Tokyo, only saying that he currently had nothing to say on the matter. Observers believe that the Tokyo talks are broad in scope and can only be used to determine whether there is a basis for future commercial negotiations. Judging by the approach taken by officials here, they feel that the Tokyo talks are too vague and are unwilling to make any criticism. Perhaps the United States is deliberately remaining silent to wait for Japan to take the initiative. Neutral parties today doubt the reports that the United States and Japan can reach a new agreement before the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty in January next year. Observers here are discussing the possibility of the United States and Japan extending the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty by exchanging notes to negotiate a transitional arrangement. They concluded that whether the United States will take this action depends entirely on whether other U.S.-Japan issues are resolved. It is generally believed that the final attitude of the U.S. government will be determined by the attitude of Congress. Congress will convene for three weeks before the expiration of the commercial treaty. Neutral parties doubt that there will be any change in Congress's attitude towards Japan. They believe that Congress will continue to support President Roosevelt's abolition of the 1911 U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. (8th United Press)</p>
<p>Rome: The "Roma Daily" correspondent in New York yesterday attacked the U.S. government for not implementing a ban on arms exports to Japan. It was reported that the U.S.'s Far East policy is entirely determined by economic purposes. The value of arms and raw materials imported into Japan from various countries totals 1,215,000,000 U.S. dollars, of which 161,000,000 U.S. dollars are supplied by the United States. Due to the current tense relations between the United States and Japan in China, the United States may implement a ban on arms exports to Japan. However, the United States is once again a victim of its blood money policy because arms manufacturers are unwilling to lose their highly profitable Japanese clients. (8th United Press)</p>
<h3>Those Who Pass the National Higher Examination Will Be Sent for Training First</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Those who pass the preliminary examination and those who are on the waiting list for this year's National Higher Examination will be sent to the Central Political School for training. After the training period is completed, a re-examination will be held before they are assigned to positions by the Central Government. It is reported that the Political School has scheduled the training to begin on February 1 next year. (8th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Three Nordic Countries Decide to Let the League of Nations Mediate the Soviet-Finnish Conflict; Efforts to Promote Negotiations Between the Two Sides; British Representative Flies to Geneva</h3>
<p>The Norwegian capital: The Norwegian Foreign Ministry issued an official report this morning stating that the foreign ministers of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway held talks here and agreed completely on the matter of resolving the Soviet-Finnish conflict through the League of Nations. (8th Huitong)</p>
<p>Danjing: The Foreign Ministers of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in the Scandinavian Peninsula issued a communiqué today after a meeting in the Norwegian capital stating that the issues raised by Finland's appeal to the League of Nations had been discussed, and it had been agreed to do their best to promote Soviet-Finnish negotiations. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>London: According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the League of Nations delegation led by Foreign Resolution Butler has flown to Geneva on a special plane due to the suspension of flights between London and Paris. The League of Nations Administrative Council meeting may be postponed for 48 hours if the British delegation cannot arrive on schedule. (8th Reuters)</p>
<p>Geneva: The Soviet Union is unlikely to be forced to withdraw from the League of Nations, and European powers are unlikely to formally propose to the League of Nations General Assembly to force the Soviet Union to withdraw from the League of Nations. Britain and France are currently unwilling to participate in the plans of South American countries to deal with the Soviet Union. Diplomatic circles here believe that the League of Nations General Assembly will be very short, and the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution will not provoke the Soviet Union, but will only condemn the Soviet Union's actions. (8th Huitong)</p>
<h3>Finland Asks All Countries to Provide Tangible Assistance; Not Just Empty Promises</h3>
<p>Fenjing: A Finnish Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters, "The Finnish people are now asking, what will the world do for Finland? Everyone is giving sympathy, but what we need is not just sympathy. If no one comes to help Finland, how can this small country of 3 million people resist the Soviet Union of 180 million people forever? Finland may be destroyed and meet the same fate as Poland, or even worse. Empty promises are useless. Providing immediate assistance in the form of arms and troops is the key. Finland's failure will have a greater impact on Britain, France, and the world than Poland's failure. Germany must also consider it. The Soviet Union now considers it its ally, but what opportunities will Germany have even if it can control Britain and France?" (8th Reuters)</p>
<p>London: European countries are providing assistance to Finland's resistance. Currently, Italy, Germany, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Sweden are supplying Finland with arms and raw materials. British aid to Finland has also begun, and France will also begin to provide assistance. The United States may directly provide Finland with economic aid. Finland's resistance can last for at least several months. Anti-Soviet sentiment is rising daily throughout Europe. Countries such as Italy may provide direct assistance to Finland in the form of manpower and arms. (8th United Press)</p>
<p>Fenjing: The Finnish government neither confirms nor denies reports that European countries, including most belligerent and neutral countries, are supplying Finland with arms and other materials. It is said that the Finnish government warmly welcomes assistance from any party. (8th United Press)</p>
<p>London: According to news last night, British manufacturers will supply Finland with 20 to 50 aircraft. Some have already been transported to Finland. Although there is no confirmation on how these aircraft are transported, it is speculated that they are first shipped out by fast cargo ships, and then take off to Finland when they are a considerable distance away. (8th United Press)</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, 60 Italian aircraft, piloted by Italian pilots, have already flown through Germany to Finland. This is the first batch of Italian aircraft to assist Finland. (7th Havana)</p>
<p>Washington: Red Cross Chairman Davis stated after discussing aid to Finland with President Roosevelt yesterday that the United States will immediately ship 50,000 sets of surgical instruments from New York to Finland via Bergen, Norway, and will hold a national fundraising campaign. Given the current public sentiment in the United States, the goal of 3 million U.S. dollars can definitely be achieved. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also stated that negotiations between the Treasury Department and the "Export-Import Bank" have been underway for a month, with the aim of enabling Finland to obtain loans. (8th United Press)</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Advances Aims to Cut Off Finnish Forces Heavy Snow and Fog in Finland Aerial Forces Unable to Operate</h3>
<p>Helsinki Sources here now believe that Soviet troops intend to invade 120 miles into Finnish territory, reaching Baiweifanimimi in the Gulf of Bothnia, to cut off the Finnish army. The Soviet army claims to have advanced to a point 97 miles from Bai Luofanimimi, less than 65 miles from the railway. Cutting off this railway would be a very important victory. The Finnish side says that the Soviet army has only advanced twelve miles and is still more than thirty-seven miles from the railway. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Labor Circles Condemn the Soviet Union Spain Shows Sympathy for Finland</h3>

They expressed their admiration for the courage and perseverance of the Finnish people in resisting aggression and urged all free countries to provide practical assistance to Finland to enable it to carry out its struggle to defend civilization and democratic institutions. The statement accused the Soviet Union of violating its obligations to Finland and attempting to seize bases within Finnish territory by force in order to endanger the freedom and security of the countries around the Baltic Sea. The Soviet Union clearly intended to annex Finland. It also stated that "Soviet imperialism has now revealed that the methods it employs are in complete alignment with those of National Socialism, which the British working class is currently united in resisting. In view of the facts that have recently occurred, the British labor movement now completely denies the Soviet Union as the leader of the world's working-class movement, the interpreter of socialism, and the protector of international peace."

<h3>Soviet Union Notifies Denmark, Norway, and Sweden Blocking the Finnish Coast Effective from Noon Yesterday</h3>

<h3>German Anti-Blockade Measures Decide to Step Up Submarine Warfare Claiming Armed Merchant Ships Are Subject to Attack British Charter of Neutral Ships Confirmed</h3>
<p>Berlin The German government published an official gazette last night, stating that armed merchant ships and armed fishing boats are not protected under the 1936 Submarine Convention. The gazette pointed out that the British Secretary of the Navy, Churchill, declared in a speech to the House of Commons that 1,000 British merchant ships have already been armed and that the number will soon double. When merchant ships and fishing boats are armed, managed by the navy, and attack enemy submarines on the surface of the water, they can no longer be protected by the Submarine Convention. Therefore, Germany's attack on armed ships does not violate international law, as international law will never restrict unilateral action and put itself in danger of suicide. (8th Huitong)</p>
<p>London Regarding the British Secretary of the Navy, Churchill's announcement in the House of Commons that the UK is currently chartering neutral ships, the London official arena confirmed this last night, saying that the Shipping Department has begun to control millions of tons of neutral ships. This approach will benefit the owners of neutral ships, as the British government will bear the responsibility of war risk, and the interests of the shipowners will be stable. The chartered ships will be escorted by the British Navy to and from various ports. Recent weeks of experience have shown that British ships in the convoy system are safer and less likely to be attacked indiscriminately by Germany than neutral ships engaged in normal commercial transportation without naval escort. In the future, neutral ships chartered by the United Kingdom will receive the same treatment as British ships regarding coal loading, repairs, and other facilities deemed crucial in the shipping industry.

<p>Amsterdam The Dutch people are outraged by the news that the Dutch transport "Taijiang Duen VIII" was sunk by a torpedo. This ship is the largest merchant ship lost by the Netherlands since the outbreak of the war. The Dutch believe that Germany recently threatened the Netherlands, and immediately after receiving the Dutch reply, it bombed and sank a Dutch ship. The aggressive attitude can already be seen. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands personally visited the flooded areas to defend against the enemy and inspected various military preparations. After Germany's new threat, the Dutch defense is no longer a secret. German officials are extremely resentful upon learning that British Consulate officials inspected cargo on Dutch ships at a certain port in the Netherlands at the suggestion of Dutch shipowners. This move could prevent delays in inspecting contraband. However, Germany pointed out that this was a serious act by the Netherlands to undermine its neutrality. It is expected that the pressure exerted by Germany on the Dutch government will increase in the future. (8th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Romania Forbids Rumor-Mongering</h3>
<p>Athens The Romanian Foreign Minister, Giaffenco, met with a special correspondent of the Greek newspaper yesterday and stated that the purpose of Romania's policy is to maintain its own balance as much as possible and maintain friendly relations with all belligerent countries. The German-Romanian trade agreement is an excellent tool for mutually beneficial trade exchange, and it is also an effective way to maintain peace in difficult times. Our friendship with all belligerent countries does not obligate Romania to participate in the war. As for the neighboring countries in the Black Sea, we believe that their position does not conflict with our peace policy. Soviet-Turkish relations are very important. We believe that the temporary interruption of Soviet-Turkish negotiations will not affect the friendly relations between the two countries. (8th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome The French Havas reporter stationed in Rome, Niger, has been forcibly deported by the Romanian authorities for spreading inaccurate information. This is not the first time that Niger has published news unfavorable to the Romanian government. Recently, after a German economic delegation arrived in Rome, Niger issued two reports, one stating that the Romanian Minister of Finance had gone abroad and the other stating that the leader of the German delegation had made dissatisfied remarks. Both matters were completely fabricated and had no basis, and their purpose was nothing more than to disrupt the normal economic relations between Germany and Romania. The Romanian government has also banned the sale of the Paris Soir and Le Jour newspapers in Romania and confiscated them all because they published inaccurate news stating that Romania's neighboring countries had threatened Romania, which does not correspond to the facts.

<h3>Maginot Line Improvements Constitute a Vast Defense Enemy Cannot Cross the Line</h3>
<p>Paris According to sources from responsible military circles in France, since the outbreak of the war, the General Staff has made further improvements to the Maginot Line. In the past three months, French soldiers have put down their rifles and picked up axes and shovels, constructing many new defensive fortifications, consuming no less than thousands of tons of steel and cement. From now on, from near Geneva on the western border of Switzerland in the south to the port of Dunkirk in France in the north, a vast and boundless defense zone has been formed. Regardless of whether the enemy uses aircraft, land bombardment, infantry assaults, or tank attacks, they will not be able to cross the line. In other words, before the outbreak of the war, the defense of northeastern France was based on the underground Maginot Line (this line stretched from near Basel on the northern border of Switzerland in the south to the city of Longwy in France in the north). At this time, there are plans to strengthen it, and a second line of defense has been set up in front of, behind, and on both sides of this line. This new line of defense is mainly composed of steel and cement fortifications, with obstacles, minefields, various traps, bunkers, and air-raid trenches to defend against tanks placed in front of it. These scattered fortifications are spread throughout the area in large numbers and are roughly the same as the deployment of the German Siegfried Line. Military circles have said that from now on, the defense of northeastern France will combine the advantages of the Maginot Line and the Siegfried Line. The former's advantage is its solidity and stability, while the latter's advantage is its intricate coordination. From now on, not only will the border between France and Germany be worry-free, but also the borders with Belgium and Switzerland will be secure. (7th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Daily Spokesperson Slanders England</h3>
<p>A Chinese newspaper in Beiping, under Japanese control, published remarks made by the Japanese military spokesperson here to Chinese journalists, stating, "England currently possesses forty percent of the world's wealth, yet it is not satisfied and seeks to seize interests elsewhere. Under the guise of the League of Nations, England seeks to exclude any country that slightly resists its desires. However, many countries still do not realize this and continue to cooperate with England, such as the Chongqing government. England treats all countries in the same way, even its own people in America are no exception. England gained victory in the last war through American financial aid, but as a result, England repudiated American debts and expanded its North American market to compete with American products. Isn't England's conspiracy terrifying? England uses the power to influence the Chongqing government to prolong the Sino-Japanese War, depleting Japan's national strength, in order to reap its own benefits. The Kuomintang regime has failed to understand this conspiracy, resulting in the war not ending and peace not being achieved. There is no other way but to overthrow England. You gentlemen are journalists, and I hope you will remember this point and make the Chinese people understand England's conspiracy. If East Asian nations wish to continue their survival, they must rise up and expel England's dangerous influence in East Asia. I graduated from an American university and have traveled abroad for seven years, so I know world events in detail." (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>(Shanxi-Henan Front) After the Chinese army in southeastern Shanxi captured Fucheng Town (southeast of Anze), the war has been in a stalemate for days. In the area of Wenxi, Xia County, Anyi, and Yuncheng in southern Shanxi, the Japanese have recently increased to more than 10,000 troops. On the morning of the 3rd, a unit of six to seven thousand Japanese troops, under the cover of more than ten Japanese aircraft, launched a two-pronged attack on the area of Shangxia Yinli, Dayugou (both west of Hengling Pass), and the mountain passes east of Wenxi and Xia County. The Chinese army met the attack on separate routes, and fierce battles unfolded. The artillery fire was fierce, unprecedented in the past three months. The battles were particularly fierce in Xiaowang Village Peishe (southeast of Wenxi), Shangyin Lizhu, and Fangshan Temple. Fangshan Temple was lost and regained three times. At night, the Chinese army launched another charge, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese, and completely recaptured Fangshan Temple. The remaining Japanese troops fled north in a panic. The Japanese troops who retreated eastward from Xiangning and other places in western Shanxi towards Fencheng have been continuously besieged, and the stronghold of Xiwang Village north of the city has been occupied. The remaining Japanese troops in the city are on the verge of collapse and may retreat. On the eastern Henan front, the Japanese troops in Tongxu launched an attack westward on the morning of the 30th. They were met with a head-on blow and, after fighting for about three hours, abandoned more than 200 corpses and retreated into the city. In addition, several hundred Japanese troops who retreated to Gaozhuang north of Taikang City were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army on the 1st, and more than half of the Japanese troops were killed or wounded. The area was recaptured at noon that day. The Chinese army then took advantage of the victory to pursue and recapture Wuzi Li northwest of the city, seizing countless weapons. They are now pressing towards Taikang County.</p>
<p>(Hubei-Hunan-Jiangxi Front) More than a thousand Japanese troops in the Jinniu area of Tongshan in southern Hubei launched an attack on Meitian and other places on the morning of the 1st under the cover of aircraft and artillery. They were met with resistance on separate routes, and after fighting fiercely until the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and their offensive was greatly frustrated. At dawn on the 3rd, the Japanese reinforced in large numbers from Tongshan and Daji, launching a counterattack on separate routes. Both sides engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat, killing more than 400 Japanese troops throughout the night. Until the morning of the 4th, fierce battles were still raging in the east and west of Meitian. Another two thousand Japanese troops engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army on the line of Jinniu Guanbu and Maqiao on the same day, lasting for two full days and nights, killing more than 700 Japanese troops and seizing many weapons and ammunition. In northern Hunan, the Chinese army launched a three-pronged night attack on Yanglousi and the nearby Xinpu and Pingshuipu on the evening of the 3rd. By the morning of the 4th, more than 300 Japanese troops had been killed or wounded, and Yanglousi, Xinpu, and Pingshuipu had all been recaptured once. Another unit of the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to capture Yunxi Station east of Yueyang, seizing a large amount of supplies. On Dongting Lake, Japanese warships have been constantly harassing the vicinity of Luojiao in recent days, but they have all been repelled and there have been no further movements. In northern Jiangxi, the Japanese troops in the area between the Fu River and the Gan River have been blindly shelling various places for days, and releasing poison gas to cover the infantry's advance, but they have all been repelled. On the evening of the 30th, the Chinese sent a team to cross the river and attack Taiping Temple and Luojia in separate directions. The Japanese were caught off guard and the Chinese rushed into Luojia, killing a large number of Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese troops in Taiping Temple are still being besieged by the Chinese. At the same time, more than a thousand Japanese troops in the Fengxin and Jing'an areas launched a combined infantry and artillery attack on Dongnao Mountain, Huangshan, and Yuqiuzi Cliff. The Chinese army was prepared and responded calmly, and launched a surprise attack on the Japanese with a part of its forces. They engaged the Japanese in fierce battles, killing or wounding up to 600 Japanese troops by the morning of the 1st, and capturing a large number of spoils of war. The remaining Japanese troops were unable to resist and fled in disorder. The front line is now calm.</p>
<p>(Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Front) The Japanese troops who should be in northern Jiangsu have been attacking Rulai Temple and Tiger Bridge for days. They have engaged in bloody battles with the Chinese army near Qiligou. The Chinese officers and soldiers have been exceptionally brave, charging back and forth and killing many Japanese troops. The Japanese have not yet succeeded. More than 400 Japanese troops in western Zhejiang launched a land and water attack on the area of Houyangsha, Tangdou, and Dingjia Bridge in Changxing County on the afternoon of the 2nd. The Chinese army met the attack and, after fighting for about three hours, the Japanese were unable to resist and retreated. Later, the Japanese reinforced and attacked again. The Chinese ambushed and launched a surprise attack, and the Japanese were unable to resist and fled. It is estimated that more than 300 Japanese troops were killed. The Japanese troops who retreated to Fanchang in southern Anhui have been surrounded and attacked by the Chinese for days. Many Japanese troops have been killed. At the moment, the remaining Japanese troops have broken through the encirclement and are retreating towards Hengshan and Sanshan. Fancheng has been recaptured. In Chuxian in northern Anhui, more than a thousand Japanese troops have been attacking Lai'an and Zilaiqiao in separate directions in recent days. They were once occupied by the Japanese, but were recaptured after reinforcements launched a counterattack. In addition, a unit of Japanese troops attacked Xiuyi from Wuhe, but were intercepted by the Chinese army near Fushan. The Japanese retreated to Wuhe, abandoning many corpses.</p>
<p>In addition, in the Sui area, the Japanese troops who attacked the counties of Sarto have been defeated and Wuchuan has been attacked, killing more than 300 Japanese troops. In southern Hebei, Kaocheng has been besieged. In western Hebei, the main force of the Japanese troops, more than 4,000, who attacked Fuping has been broken, with more than a thousand killed or captured. The Japanese troops in Linyi in southern Shandong have been besieged by the Chinese army, and the commander of the Japanese reserve team, Jichuan, and more than 400 others have been killed. These are all important achievements in the past week, and are reported here as an appendix. (6th)</p>

<h3>Japanese and Puppet Regime in Xiamen Seize Economic Rights of the People: Three Major Companies and Enterprises Forcibly Taken, Fertile Farmland in Heshan All Enclosed</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After Xiamen fell, the Japanese immediately organized the so-called "Japan-China Co-prosperity Society" as an organization to win over traitors. A man named Xu Jizhen from Aozi, because of his flattery of the Japanese, sold the fertile land and fish ponds that were the lifeblood of his ancestors' hard work and his clansmen to the Japanese, establishing the "Shi Chang Farm" to grow vegetables and raise fresh fish. Soon, Xiamen and Hebei were blockaded by the Chinese army on all sides, and vegetables cost four or five jiao per catty, and fresh fish cost one yuan and several jiao per catty. The Japanese made a great fortune, while Xu Jizhen became a beggar, receiving beatings everywhere. The Japanese then occupied the "Wushi Pu" and "Maolin" farms in Heshan, and at the same time controlled all the trees on the mountain peaks. It was at the time when Xiamen and Hebei were eating thatch and cooking bones that firewood cost about one jiao per catty, and the Japanese were already laughing and accumulating gold. However, they still felt it was not enough, and simply announced that all mountain rocks were public land, and Chinese were not allowed to take a flower or a tree. This is what they meant by co-prosperity. During the heyday of the "Co-prosperity Society", Taiwanese leaders Chen Changfu and Lin Mutu took the opportunity to set up the "Fu Da Company" and contracted the Xiamen Dou electricity, water, and telephone companies from the Japanese military authorities. Their seizure of enterprises was particularly prominent. Another Taiwanese, Chen Xuehai, also organized the "Nanhai Company" to wholesale local livestock and vegetables, forcibly extracting protection money. Taiwanese thug Fang Binghui, relying on his long-term residence in Xiamen, and being familiar with the fishermen, also quickly organized the "Xiamen Nanhai Maritime Fisheries Company." As a result, other similar organizations sprang up like mushrooms, and all were named "Association" and "Cooperative," in order to carry out business with a small investment and large profit. Therefore, their stores were named "Association," as if they held an iron certificate and a cinnabar book, and others could not compete with them. The so-called "Cooperative" was not a store or company, but an organization that plundered profits and monopolized business, such as the "Pig Teeth Cooperative," "Vegetable and Fruit Cooperative," "Material Cooperative," and "Aquatic Products Cooperative," all set up to extract "look-over money" from various industries and restrict the development of merchants.</p>
<p>The "Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board," seeing where the profits lay, also rose up to compete. With the posture of Mount Tai pressing down on the top, they first held the electricity, water, and Shan Hai Ice Factory, which were known as the three major companies in Xiamen, in their mouths, and then ordered their lackeys Li Sixian, Lu Yongchuan, Jin Fusheng, and Chen Shifu to sign and acknowledge it. The method of their seizure was: (1) the original factory's property and assets were converted into Chinese shares, managed by the puppet city government on behalf of the original shareholders; (2) the Japanese side determined that the amount of shares exceeded the Chinese side, but the principle was not to pay capital; (3) except for Li Sixian who was nominally the chairman of the board, all general managers, managers, engineers and other staff were filled by Japanese. As a result, the "Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board" had more than half of the assets of the three major companies in Xiamen without spending a penny. So this is what they meant by liaison. Originally, there were several "pawnshops" and "small pawnshops" run by Taiwanese who lent money at high interest rates in Xiamen. The Japanese declared that the "new regime" would thoroughly assume the responsibility of relieving the people's livelihood for a bright society, and specially established the "Municipal Public Pawnshop" and "Capital Loan Office" to facilitate the circulation of finance and eliminate the evils of private operation. Therefore, they ordered all "pawnshops" and "small pawnshops" in the city to close down and themselves engaged in the business of high-interest exploitation. This way of making money was only for the sake of "self-prosperity." Recently, puppets Xu Gushan and Jin Fusheng, and others, drooled over the fertile land of Heshan, and immediately came up with a whimsical idea to report to the Japanese army and ask for "experimental planting of agricultural and forestry reclamation land," and listed the scope: the first district was Houkeng Village, the second district was Gaolin Village, and the third district was Dongzhai Village. The Japanese army, seeing where the profit lay, immediately agreed. As a result, they announced the expansion of the seizure, and immediately announced that the cultivated land of Houkeng Village, Xiguo Village, Dianqian Village, Dongzhai Village, Shicun Village, Lingyao Village, Fanghu Village, and Gaolin Village would all be confiscated in order to achieve mass production. The villagers of each village cried out to heaven and earth, as if they had lost their parents.</p>
<p>When Fang Tianhua, the head of the Xiachong Village in Heshan, led the Japanese to survey the cultivated land that was the lifeline of the entire village, along with the traitors Jin Fusheng and Lin Shen, he and the villagers shed tears and gnashed their teeth, hoping to fight the traitors and others. It turned out that the Japanese discovered that there were large amounts of hot springs in the fields of the village, which could be used to build several large bathhouses for profit. Unfortunately, they broke into their fate. However, when the traitors and the Japanese brought wolf-like detectives to the village to survey and excavate every day, they had to petition first in unison. When their feet stepped into the puppet city government, the vicious puppet police barked loudly. Everyone thought that "fighting over a wife and seizing land is like sleeping in death," and it was better to die fighting than to starve to death. They plucked up their spirits and took another step forward. The traitorous wolves and dogs stabbed wildly at the weak spots with their guns and sticks. Seeing that the situation was unstoppable, everyone "cried injustice" and dispersed. After a chaotic afternoon and a sleepless night, the next day, they decided to submit a petition to cry out for grievances. They paid ten yuan to a shyster in the "Scrivener's Association" to write a complaint and sent it to the puppet government. After a month or so, they saw a notice posted saying "Difficult to approve." So Fang Tianhua and others were anxious. Returning to the village, seeing the land left by their ancestors' blood and sweat being excavated under the supervision of the Japanese, they felt like their intestines were being cut by a knife and their hearts were on fire. They immediately came forward with the villagers to stop them. At that time, the traitors and the Japanese, seemingly thinking that the public anger was hard to offend, immediately fled. That night, they reported to the Japanese military authorities. The Japanese military ordered Li Sixian to handle it. So the next afternoon, Fang Tianhua, who was walking on Zhongshan Road, was arrested by Jin Fusheng and subjected to "corporal punishment to serve as a warning." The next morning, the two puppet newspapers, with "clever words and cover-ups," published a message stating, "The Xiamen Special Municipal Government, in order to promote the construction of a happy land, develop agriculture and forestry, and carry out a plan to open up wasteland in the Heshan area, cultivate agriculture, revive rural prosperity, and enhance agricultural production, in order to thoroughly rescue the bankrupt rural areas and the unemployed farmers, and thereby develop the rural economy, the municipal government has sent personnel to measure the wasteland area in the hot spring zone of Xiachong Village in Heshan, firmly erected boundary markers, so that wasteland owners can declare the acreage and buy it as public land according to the land price for agricultural development plans. Unexpectedly, Fang Tianhua, the head of Xiachong Village, was ignorant, misinterpreted the good policies of the authorities, deceived the association, and spread all kinds of rumors, threatening and instigating the villagers of the village to refuse to declare. The matter was detected by the municipal government authorities. The head of the village, as the head of a village, should assist in the implementation of the authorities' wasteland reclamation plan to build the countryside. Instead, he incited the villagers to obstruct government orders, which is really wrong. Considering his youthful scholarship, he was given a light sentence. Yesterday, the director of the Finance Bureau, Jin, summoned the head of the village to the government, gave him a brief reprimand, and explained in detail the authorities' good intentions to love the farmers and revitalize agriculture, so that he could understand and thereby promote the implementation of agricultural and forestry construction." Clearly, it was a seizure of land, but they said it was a good intention, which can be described as utterly devoid of conscience.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Taixian Chamber of Commerce Cao Deliang Dies: Military and Political Authorities Hold Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: Cao Deliang, the standing chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Subei International Relief Committee, and the father of the writer Cao Mengyu, has been handling military service and resettling refugees since the outbreak of the War of Resistance. He also served as the director of the Food Regulation Office. The military and political authorities consulted him on everything. He worked diligently day and night, not avoiding difficulties. Taixian has been as solid as a rock to this day, thanks to Cao's efforts. Unexpectedly, he suddenly suffered a stroke on September 30 and passed away. The people of the entire county mourned him. The military and political authorities felt as if they had lost an arm. Various agencies and legal entities held memorial meetings. Li Mingyang, the commander-in-chief of the Subei, Luanhui Border Area Guerrilla Forces, and Li Changjiang, the deputy commander-in-chief, held a memorial service in the headquarters. The eulogy stated, "Heaven is unjust, not leaving an elder. All our soldiers and civilians mourn in unison. You, sir, led the masses. In this national crisis, you exhausted your intelligence. You supported the army and maintained order. You rescued more than 50,000 refugees. The rear work was extremely diligent. You devoted yourself to the war. Your death is a loss to the country. The people of the entire county are as if drunk." Li Mingyang and Li Changjiang also gave慷慨激昂 speeches, praising him to the utmost, with tears in their eyes. Everyone present was moved.</p>

In addition to the conference earnestly discussing and making it a perfect plan for implementation, there are still matters that should be paid attention to by the conference. In these cases, inappropriate phrases such as "Greater Chinese National Unity" and the current erroneous concepts popular in society are the same, which have a very dangerous impact on the future of the War of Resistance and nation-building. The conference decided to request the central government to issue an order that the abusive use of terms such as Miao, Yi, Man, Yao, Guo, Dong, and other ethnic minorities should be prohibited in the future) and other cases, as well as five cases decided by the conference to be sent to the ministry for reference, there are also fourteen other cases on frontier education that are incorporated into the "Frontier Education Improvement Plan" for discussion, with the proposal of the Ministry of Education as the main one.

<h3>Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes Yesterday: Alleviation of Auxiliary Coin Panic, 5 Million Yuan in One-Yuan Legal Tender Also Arrived, Auxiliary Coins to Return to Shanghai at the End of the Settlement Period</h3>
<p>To alleviate the panic due to the shortage of auxiliary currency notes, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank, with the approval of the head office, began to gradually issue the second batch of fractional currency notes yesterday. At the same time, a large quantity of one-yuan notes arrived and were distributed by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications as much as possible to regulate the market. Therefore, the panic regarding one-yuan notes, auxiliary currency notes, and fractional currency notes is gradually being resolved. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Second Batch of Fractional Notes Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>The second batch of fractional currency notes, amounting to 500,000 yuan, was printed by the American-owned Wing On Company. The contract for the third batch of fractional currency notes was finalized yesterday. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank began to gradually issue the second batch of fractional currency notes yesterday, initially distributing them to 46 member banks of the Bankers' Association and 42 member money shops of the Money Dealers' Association, with amounts ranging from 100 to 500 yuan per institution. Many large companies, businesses, and factories have requested to receive these notes, and their requests are being reviewed separately. Once the quantities are determined, they will be notified to collect them. It is reported that each of the four major companies will initially receive 500 yuan. The total amount of fractional currency notes issued yesterday was approximately 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Five Million Yuan in One-Yuan Notes Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>In view of the shortage of one-yuan notes in the Shanghai market, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have been providing as many of their existing one-yuan notes, both new and old, as possible to various banks and money shops for circulation in the market. All member banks and money shops of the Bankers' Association and the Money Dealers' Association can apply to the three banks to receive these notes. In addition, a large quantity of new one-yuan notes, printed by the Central Bank, has arrived in Shanghai via the British-owned HSBC Bank, with the aim of regulating market demand. It is reported that many banks and money shops exchanged for these notes at the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications starting yesterday. The amount of one-yuan notes that arrived is said to be 5 million yuan, so there should be no further shortage of one-yuan notes in the future.</p>
<p>Substantial Inflow of Auxiliary Coins into the Interior</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking and money-changing circles yesterday that since the population of Shanghai has increased and silver dollars and nickel coins have disappeared from the market, the need for auxiliary currency notes has increased even further. Although financial institutions have repeatedly increased the issuance and supply of these notes, it should be sufficient to meet demand. However, due to the extremely high demand in the interior, the quantity of auxiliary currency notes flowing from Shanghai to the interior, though not statistically quantified, must be very large and continuous. This is why the panic over auxiliary currency notes in this area has persisted for so long. However, due to the increased ease of circulation between the interior and Shanghai, the outflow of auxiliary currency is now increasing daily, and the impact on Shanghai is gradually becoming noticeable.</p>
<p>Merchants' Demand for Goods Acquisition is Pressing</p>
<p>Copper and nickel coins in the occupied areas have been melted down and have disappeared completely. Even some of the auxiliary currency notes circulating in the city are inevitably lost or scattered due to the displacement of refugees. Financial institutions in the occupied areas have either relocated or closed down, so there is no source of supply or central collection point for auxiliary currency notes. The speed of circulation among commercial users is decreasing, so the quantity needed is enormous. Moreover, it is harvest season. This year is still considered a bountiful year. Merchants going to the interior to purchase goods must bring auxiliary currency notes with them. Furthermore, the area where they are used is extremely wide. All cities, towns, and villages connected to Shanghai by train and ship require auxiliary coins and currency notes.</p>
<p>Return is Inevitable at the End of the Settlement Period</p>
<p>The supply and demand and circulation of currency often shift with the seasons. In the past, it was customary in Shanghai for the autumn to be a lending season. At the time of the autumn harvest, merchants flocked to the interior to purchase goods, so the demand for auxiliary coins increased, and many auxiliary coins flowed into the interior. When the settlement period at the end of the year arrived, the loans would flow back to Shanghai. This was the case in peacetime; it is even more so today. In peacetime, although the scale of financial institutions in the interior was smaller than that of Shanghai, they could still naturally regulate collection and distribution. Now, however, the financial focus of the interior is in Shanghai, so the relationship between supply and demand is even closer. When currency notes are needed, Shanghai is the source. When commercial settlements are completed, the currency notes will inevitably return and concentrate in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The British Consul-General Protests Against False Authorities Extorting House Taxes, British Residents Outside the Boundary Have No Obligation to Pay Taxes to the False Finance Bureau</h3>
<p>Sir Philip, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, has lodged a protest with the "Mayor," Fu Xiao'an, because the "Finance Bureau" of the "Da Dao Municipal Government" in the western district of Shanghai is attempting to collect "house taxes" from British residents in the extra-settlement road area, and has recently resorted to threats and harassment. The residents find the harassment unbearable. The protest states that it is inappropriate for the "Finance Bureau" to collect "house taxes" from British residents, and that British residents living in any lane outside the boundary in western Shanghai have no obligation to pay taxes to the "Da Dao Municipal Government." British residents should continue to pay house taxes through the Shanghai Municipal Council as before. The protest also points out the incident on the morning of the 6th, when two tax collectors from the "Finance Bureau," Yao Ping and Liu Yongqing, extorted "house taxes" from British residents at No. 7 C-section, Difeng Road.</p>
<h3>Adopting Emergency Measures to Suppress Rice Prices, Delivery Limited to Three Days After Transaction, Strict Punishment for Violators Starting Today</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Rice Dealers' Association jointly decided to contribute to the Market Management Committee, shortening the deadline for rice transactions to five or three days, public opinion has consistently urged that this is the only way to calm rice prices. As of yesterday, the Market Management Committee adopted this opinion, and because rice prices rose again yesterday, breaking records and causing alarm, the Market Management Committee held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss measures to control rice prices. It was decided that the delivery date for goods transacted in the market would be limited to three days, and no checks could be returned. This will be strictly enforced starting today.</p>
<p>Emergency Measures by the Management Committee</p>
<p>The Rice Market Management Committee, concerned that the soaring rice prices are not only affecting the livelihood of citizens but also hindering the business of fellow merchants, held its 55th meeting at the Qinglian Pavilion Public Sample Office on Fuzhou Road yesterday afternoon. The attendees included Fu Qian'geng, Zhang Lizhong, Cai Shengming, Lu Zhaofang, Zheng Shengyun, Zhong Xusheng, Gu Yisheng, Hu Wen'an, Yin Fuxiang, Ye Pinshan, Yang Shaoyuan, Xu Yesun, Zhou Zhizhen, and Wang Tianchou. Chairman Fu Qian'geng reported, stating briefly that the soaring rice prices in recent days are unreasonable. If measures are not taken to remedy the situation, the consequences will be dire. He hoped that the committee members would share their opinions and find ways to remedy the situation. The committee members unanimously agreed that the key to stabilizing rice prices was to stop speculative buying and selling. It was then decided that the delivery period for all goods would be limited to three days, effective from today.</p>
<p>Regulations Issued in a Public Notice</p>
<p>After passing the resolution yesterday, the Management Committee immediately issued a public notice, which stated the following: "The market transactions of this association, domestic rice have always been spot transactions, without any standard for the date. The stipulated ten-day deadline refers to foreign rice and Keqian rice. However, at this time of market chaos, the delivery of goods after the transaction is temporarily limited to three days. Whether it is wholesale or retail, or between merchants, all must abide by the scope of their business, only allowing actual transactions and prohibiting speculative buying and selling. Once a transaction is completed, the prescribed form must be used for it to be a formal transaction. If there is a breach of contract after the deadline, each party must submit the transaction certificate to facilitate the disposal of the management office. The penalties will be: for minor violations, suspension of business; for major violations, revocation of membership by the General Association. The same applies to customers, and the relevant customer associations will handle the matter accordingly. Those who do not operate in accordance with the above regulations will be treated as illegal transactions and will be dealt with as violations. The above temporary measures were decided by the 55th Market Management Committee on December 8 and will be implemented from the 9th. Transactions on the market before the 9th will be settled according to the previous regulations. This is a public announcement recorded by both houses. It is hoped that everyone will abide by it."</p>
<p>Sources May be Smooth Next Year</p>
<p>Rising rice prices and the inability to ensure smooth delivery are also contributing factors. However, the amount of rice arriving in Shanghai daily by land and water routes recently is in the range of six to seven thousand packages. The ordered tribute rice is also arriving in Shanghai every other day at a rate of ten to twenty thousand packages. In theory, rice prices should not rise further. The fact that they are going in the opposite direction is truly unexpected. A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency learned that starting from January of next year, there will be no restrictions on Shanghai merchants and firms going to the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to purchase rice for consumption. They can transport it out as much as possible. However, the news may change in an instant.</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation Requests the Maintenance of People's Food Supply</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that the common people suffer the most direct harm from the soaring rice prices. Not only has the food supply within the boundary become a source of panic, but the security of the concessions has also been greatly affected. Some time ago, they suggested to the authorities of the two concessions that they send personnel to purchase as much rice as possible from the producing areas during the new grain season, transport it to Shanghai, set up warehouses for storage, and be prepared to regulate the market for the benefit of the people's livelihood. Although the authorities of the two concessions sympathized with this suggestion, they have not been able to implement it, which is regrettable. Because the rice market has become increasingly chaotic in recent days and it has become even more difficult for the common people to make a living, they appealed again to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, urging them to quickly devise effective measures to suppress rice prices so that both security and the people's food supply can benefit together. This is urgently necessary.</p>
<p>Severe Punishment for Violations by Grain Measurers</p>
<p>Previously, the Bean and Rice Industry Association stipulated that grain measurers should deduct one cent per stone, of which seven millimeters are for the labor of the grain measurers in the industry, and the remaining three millimeters are for the relief fund for unemployed grain measurers. However, recently, some grain measurers in the industry have gone to various rice shops to collect the three millimeters of relief fund for unemployed grain measurers, and sometimes deduct one and a half millimeters. Yesterday, a certain unemployed grain measurer went to the rice market to collect grain measuring fees from fellow rice merchants and was stopped by a grain measurer in the industry, almost leading to violence, but was eventually dissuaded by fellow merchants. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council's supervisor stationed in the rice market and the Market Management Committee are paying close attention to grain measurers in the industry who violate the association's resolutions. If such behavior is discovered again, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Japan Seizes Control of the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, Japanese Nationals to Assume the Roles of Chief Engineer and Others, Japan Also Retains the Right to Use Dredgers</h3>
<p>The dredging project on the Whangpoo River, which has been suspended for more than two years, will soon resume work due to an agreement reached between Japan and the Whangpoo Conservancy Board. Last night, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy announced at a press briefing that, "After six months of negotiations on the resumption of the Whangpoo River project, an agreement was reached on December 1 between the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, and the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, after overcoming the difficult hurdle of who will manage the Whangpoo Conservancy Board in the future. Thereafter, the chief engineer and other important positions in the board will be held by Japanese personnel. The existing Chinese personnel of the board will not be transferred. However, Li Jiannan, the 'Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs,' will join the staff. The Japanese Army and Navy will retain the right to use some of the dredgers belonging to the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, including the largest dredger, Jianhua." A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency visited foreign diplomatic circles here to solicit their opinions. According to them, "The reorganization of the Shanghai Whangpoo Conservancy Board is just another move by the Japanese to seize control of Shanghai's hegemony." According to well-informed sources in the shipping industry, "During the 'August 13th' Incident, the Japanese seized the dredgers as 'war spoils.' After the end of the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese refused to resume dredging work on the pretext of military operations, allowing the Whangpoo River to gradually silt up. The dredgers seized by the Japanese were sent to the channels used exclusively by Japanese ships to dredge silt. Today, the Japanese say that they must retain the right to use the dredgers in order to continue to facilitate Japanese ships in the inland rivers."</p>
<h3>Changes in Rates for Domestic Parcel Delivery</h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts has repeatedly issued orders to change the rates for domestic parcel delivery. Due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the cost of postal vehicles, and the increase in transportation costs for rented commercial vehicles, the Shanghai Postal Administration has been ordered to compile a temporary surcharge schedule for domestic parcels. The delivery fees for small packages have also been revised. The reporter has learned the revised prices, which are listed below:</p>

<p>The fees for mutual delivery between the Shanghai Post Office and domestic offices, for shipments to Guangzhou, Shantou, Haikou, Xiamen, Hangzhou, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Beihai, Jiujiang, Hankou, and their subordinate offices, will be subject to a surcharge of five cents per kilogram in addition to the original parcel fee.

An additional 20 cents will be charged per package for parcels that are not transferred via "Annam" (30 cents for shipments to Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang). If the package is transferred via Annam, an additional 1 yuan will be charged per package. If there is any discrepancy in the postage, you can call or write to the Business Office of the Shanghai Postal Administration.</p>
<p>Fees for Small Packages</p>
<p>For small packages that are delivered locally, the postage is 10 cents for every 100 cubic centimeters or any fraction thereof.

<h3>Two Arrested Chinese Detectives Expected to be Released Soon, Meeting with the Two Chinese Detectives Possible Next Tuesday, No Confirmed Report on Details of Discussions with the Bureau</h3>
<p>Two Chinese detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department were arrested by the Gendarmerie on the afternoon of the 19th of last month while performing routine duties at the intersection of Robison Road and Pinlang Road, together with a Western police chief, Aigbuo, and a female inspector. With the exception of Aigbuo and the female inspector, who were released after being detained for five hours, there has been no news of the release of the two Chinese detectives. It was said that the "Shanghai West Court" had sentenced them, but the Police Department immediately denied this. According to sources, the two arrested Chinese detectives are expected to be released soon. The Police Bureau may meet with the two arrested Chinese detectives on Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.</p>
<h3>Second Anniversary of the Passing of the Panchen Lama, Public Memorial Service Held in the City Yesterday, Bronze Statue of the Master Cast for Public Viewing</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second anniversary of the passing of the former Envoy of the Western Frontier, the Panchen Lama. The Shanghai Bodhi Society held a public memorial service yesterday afternoon. The Preparatory Office of the Panchen Temple also made the bronze statue of the Master available for public viewing and presented bronze badges as souvenirs. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Solemn and Grand Public Memorial Ceremony</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bodhi Society was organized by celebrities Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Guan Jiongzhi, and others, with the aim of promoting Buddhism. To commemorate the second anniversary of the passing of the Panchen Lama, the society held a public memorial service at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant on Parker Road at 11:00 a.m. yesterday. Those who attended included Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Feng Yangshan, Tao Fuqing, Rosang Yixi Ze, Yuan Chen of the Jade Buddha Temple, and more than 30 others. The ceremony hall was located on the second floor of Gongdelin. A portrait of the Master was placed on the offering table, surrounded by colorful arches made of flowers. Twelve items such as fresh vegetables and sweets were placed in the center. Incense was burned, candles were lit, and the arrangement was simple and neat. The ceremony began at 11:30 a.m. First, the chief celebrant, Wen Lanting, and the assistant celebrants, Guan Jiongzhi and Huang Hanzhi, performed a solemn ceremony. Then, they took turns to worship. After the ceremony, they had a meal together.</p>
<p>Bronze Statue of the Panchen Lama on Public View</p>
<p>Rosang Qingpi, the great disciple of the Panchen Lama and the founder of the Mongolian-Tibetan Institute, previously invited various Dharma protectors in Shanghai to cast a bronze statue of the Master, which was completed on Buddha's Birthday this year. Yesterday, he brought the statue to be enshrined in the Preparatory Office of the Panchen Temple at No. 5 Shuanghe Village, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Bayle, welcoming people from all walks of life to pay their respects and presenting a bronze bell-shaped commemorative medal. Wen Lanting, Zhang Xiaolin, Tao Fuqing, Rongzeng Kanbu, Rosang Yixi Ze, and others went to pay their respects. According to Rosang Qingpi, the bronze statue of the Panchen Lama was originally intended to be placed in a temple to be built on Mount Putuo, but this was suspended due to environmental restrictions. Currently, celebrities in Shanghai are planning to find a place to house it. He also mentioned that the Mongolian-Tibetan Institute has more than 200 students, mostly from the border areas. More than 40 students have graduated from the institute, all of whom are proficient in Tibetan language and writing. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, all of them have gone to the border areas to assist the government in their service.</p>

<h3>Ge Shulin Shot at at the Intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Avenue Foch, Assassin Fires Two Shots in a Row, Both Missing, Detective Chases Assassin, Captured After Being Shot, Stray Bullet Kills and Injures Five People in Total</h3>
<p>At 9:50 a.m. yesterday, a shooting occurred at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Avenue Foch, on the border of the British and French Concessions. Ge Shusen, a Hebei native who had previously served as a police officer but has now changed his name and is acting as a puppet official, was the target of an assassination. Ge was fortunate to escape injury as he dodged very quickly at the time. However, when a detective chased after the assailant, five pedestrians were injured by stray bullets, and two died of their injuries. The shooter was also arrested. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attempted Harm</p>
<p>At around 9:40 a.m. yesterday, Ge Shusen left his residence at No. 4 Siming Village on Avenue Foch and walked to the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue Cardinal Mercier, intending to take a bus there. Just as he arrived at the bus stop, a young man suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, pulled out a Mauser pistol, and shot at Ge. Because of his current "position," Ge had been prepared at all times, so when he saw someone trying to harm him, he quickly dodged.</p>
<p>Assassin Hit</p>
<p>At that time, the young man was firing his Mauser pistol at Ge, firing two shots in quick succession, while shouting "Get out of the way!" Ge, at this critical moment of life and death, had already run to No. 939 to take cover. Seeing the tense situation, the young man attempted to follow and pursue him. At that moment, two Western police officers were patrolling from east to west on motorcycles. When they reached the entrance of Siming Lane, they suddenly heard gunshots and followed the sound. They saw the assassin walking west to east along the wall of the Rue Cardinal Mercier Garden, facing the detective. The two Western police officers immediately fired their pistols at the assassin, and two Chinese detectives had also arrived after hearing the gunshots. At that time, there were many pedestrians on the road, so the Western police officers chased the assassin along the road, all the way to the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Avenue Foch. There were fewer pedestrians there, so the two Western police officers fired their guns to order him to stop. The Chinese detectives also assisted in the chase. The assassin was unable to resist and was shot and fell at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Avenue Foch.</p>
<p>Frightened Escape</p>
<p>Ge Shusen was wearing a coat with an otter collar yesterday. After hearing the gunshots, he quickly dodged, escaping injury. It is reported that Ge is already in his fifties, from Hebei Province, and has a tall stature. He once served as an inspector in the City Public Security Bureau. After the Sino-Japanese War, Ge changed his name to Zhang and became a "Captain" in the puppet "Public Security Bureau," usually serving in western Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he left his residence, and it is said that he was also going there on business. When the assassin fired at Ge, Ge pretended to fall to the ground and then crawled to No. 939. Therefore, both bullets hit the wall there. In a state of fright, Ge fled down Weihaiwei Road while the Western police officers were chasing the assassin.</p>
<p>Two Dead, Three Injured</p>
<p>When the Western police officers chased the assassin, the assassin was hit in the hail of bullets, with two bullets hitting his head. He immediately fell to the ground. At that time, five pedestrians near the Zhirenyong Girls' School were injured by stray bullets. Those who have been identified are: (1) Zhang Asi (28 years old, from Haimen, residing at No. 30 Cihou South Lane, Rue Cardinal Mercier), injured in the left foot, sent to the Red Cross Hospital; (2) rickshaw puller Gu Xingshi (42 years old, from Jiangbei), injured in the right leg; (3) Pan Zhihai, a worker at the Pacific Coal Store on Weihaiwei Road (35 years old, from Ningbo), injured in the right foot; (4) a passing begging monk, injured in the left chest, sent to the Police Bao and Long Hospitals for treatment; (5) an unknown man resembling a coolie, shot in the lower jaw, died upon arrival at the hospital. The begging monk was shot in the front of the brain and also died shortly after. The young assassin was wearing a herringbone wool coat. It is said that after being injured, he claimed his name was Wang Sanxiao, but the details are still awaiting a thorough investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>All Employees of the Second Special Court Petition for a Salary Increase, Expected to be Resolved Satisfactorily Within Days</h3>
<p>Since Chen Maoxian took office as the president of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court, not a single official or employee in the entire court has been transferred. Therefore, all officials and employees are working hard. However, at a time when rice prices are soaring, dozens of employees of the court, because of their low positions and low salaries, are unable to make a living, and they jointly petitioned the chief of the general affairs section to submit their petition to President Chen, requesting him to take into consideration their situation and make appropriate salary adjustments. It is reported that this matter will be resolved satisfactorily within days. It is reported that the No. 3 High Branch Court, in view of the extremely high cost of living at present, has followed the example of the No. 2 High Branch Court and the No. 1 Special District Court in the British Concession and has appropriately increased the salaries of guards and other employees, or has provided temporary subsidies and restored the previous bonus system, in order to maintain their current livelihoods until the situation recovers.</p>
<h3>"Bad Land" Becomes a Den of Iniquity; Bandits Run Rampant in Broad Daylight; Robberies and Thefts Emerge One After Another; A Meeting to Share Money Turns to Handguns</h3>
<p>After the policing authority of the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Office was encroached upon by the Japanese puppet regime, the influence of evil forces gradually expanded, creating today's "bad land," a den of iniquity. Since the beginning of winter, gangsters have been running rampant in broad daylight in the "bad land" area, and robberies have emerged one after another. The security situation there has fallen into a state of utter disrepair.</p>
<p>Doctor Encounters Robbery on His Way Home from Diagnosing Patients</p>
<p>Yesterday around 11:00 a.m., a doctor from the Chinese Medical Association, accompanied by a female nurse, went to the Third Refugee Shelter of the Tzu Lien Branch at 93 Rue Béliard (a residence once occupied by the puppet "Self-Defense Corps") to treat refugees. When they were about to return after finishing their work, they were suddenly stopped by "gangsters" just as they stepped out of the gate. The gangsters threatened them with guns, forcibly took the doctor's overcoat and the nurse's gold ring, and then fled without a trace. The doctor and nurse suffered this loss and could only lament in vain.</p>
<p>Sweet Potato Boat Owner Robbed of Proceeds</p>
<p>The second incident of "gangster" robbery and violence yesterday occurred near the Place de l'Etoile on Route Ghisi. Around 10:00 a.m., several sweet potato boats were docked in the Suzhou Creek. After the boat owner went ashore and sold the sweet potatoes to a local merchant, he obtained more than 800 yuan. Upon returning to the boat, he was suddenly followed by "gangsters" who used violent means to rob him of all the money. Afterward, the boat owner burst into tears, which moved the onlookers to sorrow.</p>
<p>Famous Rabbits Stolen from Shanghai Rabbit Farm</p>
<p>Around 11:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Luh Chia Road Hai Qi Rabbit Farm, located in the Extra-Settlement Roads area, reported a sudden theft of twenty-one pairs of rabbits. The farm raises more than two hundred pairs of famous European and American breeds such as Angora, Bleu de Vienne, and Blanc de Hotot, all of which are extremely valuable. Therefore, the estimated loss is over a thousand yuan. The rabbit thieves climbed over the wall from outside the farm. Footprints were found on the walls of the farm and the neighboring gardens. The farm is currently investigating the case.</p>
<p>Meeting to Share Money Turns to Pointing Guns</p>
<p>Yesterday around 3:00 p.m., four "diners," all dressed in plain clothes and looking quite wealthy, suddenly arrived at a restaurant in Tsao Chia Du. The manager immediately greeted them attentively. After the diners were seated, they each ordered their favorite dishes and devoured them voraciously. When it came time to pay the bill, which totaled 25.40 yuan, they initially argued about who would pay, then looked at each other blankly. Finally, one of them drew a handgun and declared to the manager, "It's inconvenient today; we'll settle it the day after tomorrow." With that, they brazenly left.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company Transfers Company Assets; New Company Registered in the United States; Shareholders Exchange Old Shares for New Shares; Number of Shares in Old and New Companies Equivalent</h3>
<p>Regarding the transfer of assets and exchange of old shares for new shares by the Shanghai Telephone Company, a special announcement was released yesterday stating: "To the Shareholders of Shanghai Telephone Company, Greetings. The Board of Directors of the Company, in a meeting held in New York State, USA, on December 6, 1939, resolved to issue a dividend to each shareholder of Shanghai General Currency 60 cents per share, to be issued in Shanghai on December 27, according to the names of the shareholders registered as of 5:00 p.m. on December 15. A special shareholders' meeting was held in New York on November 22, 1939, regarding this matter, and the Company previously issued a notice on October 10 of the same year, which was mailed to each shareholder on record.</p>
<p>Deadline for Share Transfers</p>
<p>All matters regarding the sale of the Company's assets to Shanghai Telephone Company (registered in the United States) and the dissolution of the Company have been approved. The Company's Board of Directors, therefore, decided to hold a meeting in New York on December 6 of the same year to close all of the Company's transfer books on December 15 of the same year. Only shareholders registered will have the right to receive liquidation distribution from the Company. This liquidation distribution is in the form of shares of Shanghai Telephone Company (registered in the United States), which will be issued to the shareholders of Shanghai Telephone Company on a one-for-one basis. As for the market value, the shares of the two companies are the same, namely Shanghai General Currency 10 yuan per share. The number of new shares of Shanghai Telephone Company (registered in the United States) will be equal to the number of shares held by each shareholder registered as of December 15, 1939, and will be distributed on December 27. Thereafter, this Company will be dissolved. However, because the final date for Company share transfers is December 15, and the liquidation distribution and shares of Shanghai Telephone Company (registered in the United States) will be issued to the shareholders registered on that date,</p>
<p>Shareholders Should Register Promptly</p>
<p>Therefore, all true holders of shares, or designated trustees, should come to register immediately. All true holders of shares, or designated trustees, must exchange their old shares for the new shares under the aforementioned names by 5:00 p.m. on November 15, 1939. Therefore, when the Company distributes the liquidation distribution on December 27, 1939, it will only recognize the shareholders registered before 5:00 p.m. on December 15, 1939, and will distribute the new shares to them. After December 15, 1939, the Company's shares will be invalid and should be discarded."</p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Missing Girl; No Trace After Extensive Investigation; Female Worker Yin Wang is a Prime Suspect</h3>
<p>Yin Wang, a woman from Taixing (age 20), is a female worker at the Shen Xin No. 6 Cotton Mill. She lives in the factory dormitory at No. 140 Route Pottier. On the afternoon of the 22nd of last month, two Taixing girls living in the same dormitory, Yang Hongying (age 15) and Qu Yindi (age 16),</p>
<p>Suddenly Disappeared</p>
<p>The two girls usually ate meals at the home of their fellow townsman, Wang Zhuang. They have not returned since. Wang Zhuang asked Yin Wang about the situation, but Yin Wang's answers were evasive. Wang Zhuang reported this information to the Putuo Road Police Station. The police dispatched detectives to bring Yin Wang to the police station. Under investigation, Yin Wang stated that she had recently gone to visit Lu Xiaolin, a young woman at No. 1268 Route Robert, Zhabei, with the two girls, and had also gone to Dr. Chen Shaoliang's clinic at No. 1088 Tsao Chia Du for medical treatment. The rest of her statements were</p>
<p>Very Vague</p>
<p>And her demeanor was flustered. She was sent to the First Special District Court. As to where the two girls were, she claimed not to know. She was sent back to detention for further investigation. Yang and Qu have not been found, and there are no clues to be found. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng came to the Third Criminal Court for continued trial. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the process, and then the woman who cooked meals, Wang Zhuang, testified, "At that time, I sternly questioned her about the disappearance of Yang and Qu. She admitted that she could find them." When questioned about the statements Yin Wang made at the police station and what she had said to Wang Zhuang,</p>
<p>She Completely Denied Everything</p>
<p>And insisted that she did not know anything about the disappearance of the two girls, where they had gone, or whether they would return. She cried out for injustice and begged for leniency. Police lawyer Li rose and stated that Yin Wang was very much related to the disappearance of the two girls. She had previously said that the two girls had gone to Lu Xiaolin's residence at No. 1268 Route Robert. The police dispatched detectives to investigate Lu Xiaolin, but there was no such person. Her words were not reliable. The court ordered a further postponement and ordered that Chen Yisheng be summoned to court to testify and verify the facts.</p>
<h3>Woman Wang Yuee Flees with Japanese Currency; Her Paramour Also Implicated and Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Wang Yuee, a woman from Hai Ning who worked as a maid for a Japanese man named Miyoshi, residing at No. 24 Dade Li, North Szechuan Road, on the morning of the 6th of this month, took advantage of her employer's inattention and stole 1,150 Japanese yen from a clothing chest. She fled to No. 3 Tonglin Li, Mingde Road, Zhabei, and gave the money to her paramour, Dong Futang, to exchange for legal tender, intending to escape back to their hometown together. Yesterday afternoon, they carried the money into the Public Settlement to purchase jewelry and were arrested by Chinese detective Peng Bingsheng of the Central Police Station. 1,100 yuan in legal tender, a watch, and a gold ring were found on their persons. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Dai concluded the trial and sentenced Wang Yuee to six months in prison for theft and Dong Futang to three months in prison for receiving stolen goods. The stolen jewelry and cash were returned to the owner.</p>
<h3>Guard Sells Drugs; Testimonies Shirk Responsibility; Court Orders Conclusion of Trial and Awaits Judgment</h3>
<p>Li Han and Tu Kun, two guards at the Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet in the French Concession, jointly invested in selling drugs such as morphine and cigarettes outside the prison in September of this year. They handed them over to inmate Jin Mingquan to resell to fellow inmates. On the 27th of the same month, the warden discovered this, found the evidence, and reported it to the supervisory department. The two guards, Li and Tu, along with the inmate Jin, were transferred to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. During the investigation, guard Tu Kun absconded after posting bail, fearing punishment for a false charge. The prosecutor repeatedly opened court sessions to investigate and also summoned fellow inmates Shi Genquan, Xiong Dequan, Chen Asan, Li Zhiming, and Qian Xingsheng to testify and prove the facts. The investigation was declared over, and the two guards, Li and Tu, and the inmate Jin Mingquan, were indicted for malfeasance and other crimes in the criminal court of the same level. An arrest warrant was issued for the fugitive Tu Kun. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun Pengxian and the prosecutor opened a court session for the trial. Li Han denied selling drugs and cigarettes and claimed to be unaware of the matter. Jin Mingquan completely shifted the blame onto the fugitive guard Tu Kun. The two defendants appointed lawyers Wei Weiqing and Wang Hengyi to defend them. The court announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the sentencing date. Defendant Li Han was released on his original bail, and Jin Mingquan was sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>Attempting to Cross the Security Line; Chinese Arrested</h3>
<p>The junction of Huisi, Hongkou, North Jiangxi Road, and Haining Road is the entrance and exit of the Japanese military security line. In recent days, the situation at this entrance and exit has become tense again. All persons entering and exiting are subject to strict inspection. Around 8:45 p.m. yesterday, a Chinese man, about thirty years old, was loitering at the entrance and exit, seeming to want to pass through the area and enter Inner Hongkou, but also seeming not to have a pass and daring not to move forward. He was thus in a dilemma, deep in thought. Unexpectedly, his behavior aroused the suspicion of a Japanese sentry, who walked to the edge of the security line and questioned him sternly. The man panicked and did not speak Japanese, so he could not answer. He turned around and retreated into the area guarded by the concession police, but this caused a misunderstanding. The Japanese sentry immediately fired a shot at him with his weapon, but fortunately missed. The sentry then tried to take the man away. The police officers on duty at the scene immediately reported the situation to the police station, and Japanese police officers were dispatched to investigate. After questioning the man, it was learned that he did indeed want to go to Hongkou, but had not obtained a pass and was therefore hesitant at the security line, leading to the misunderstanding. After obtaining a statement, the police station ordered detectives to investigate the man's occupation and address in order to decide what to do with him.</p>
<h3>Chen Weida, Owner of the Weida Hotel, Accused of Obstruction of Freedom</h3>
<p>Gu Yuesheng, a native of Nanhui and owner of the Gu Yueji Construction Factory at No. 297 Route Ladu in the French Concession, recently engaged lawyer Hu Fengtu to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District against Chen Weida, owner of the Weida Hotel on Avenue Joffre, accusing him of using violence and coercion to obstruct public works and requesting an investigation according to Article 304 of the Criminal Code, and requesting the right to prosecute him civilly, and retaining the right to pursue damages. According to the complaint, the plaintiff contracted with the defendant in May of this year to build a house at No. 392 on the land register of the French Municipal Council on Rue Laugier, with payments to be made in installments, and a contract was signed. By October, eight installments had been paid, but 3,000 yuan remained unpaid, and the increased construction costs were also withheld. In November, the defendant suddenly engaged a lawyer to send a letter of warning, terminating the contract. The plaintiff was forced to engage a lawyer to reply according to law and to negotiate a settlement, but the defendant had no sincerity, so it was unsuccessful. On the 27th of the same month, the defendant led the secretary of the court, police officers, and clerks to expel the workers guarding the site and began construction without authorization. On the 30th, the plaintiff and his lawyer went to the site to take photographs to present as evidence, but they were again obstructed. The plaintiff's actions clearly constitute obstruction of the freedom of others and the exercise of their rights. Therefore, the plaintiff requested that the defendant be punished according to the law. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Jiang Liquan came to the Criminal Court yesterday to summon the parties. The plaintiff and his lawyer appeared in court and explained the case. The defendant also appeared in court with his defense lawyer and stated that the plaintiff had made unreasonable demands, using the pretext of joint discussion of conditions to force an increase of 30% in costs, so the contract was terminated. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered a debate, declared that the facts of the case were clear, and scheduled the judgment for the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a Teacher; Scamming Parents</h3>
<p>Mrs. Cai Yao, who lives at No. 61 Mantiangfang Street, Wuma Road, was visited by a woman of about thirty years old last Sunday afternoon, who claimed to be named Zhang. She greeted the Cai family and said that she was a teacher at Yao's alma mater. Yao was out, and the family, seeing that she was Yao's teacher, entertained her cordially. The woman was eloquent. When she was about to leave, she suddenly said that she had rushed out in a hurry and had forgotten to bring her purse. She said that her aunt was in Hong Kong and had an important matter to telegraph, but she had not brought any money. If she went back to get it, she was afraid that she would not have enough time and would not be able to send the telegram today, so she ventured to borrow a dozen yuan and would return it immediately tomorrow. The Cai family lent her fifteen yuan. The woman left unhurriedly. After a while, Cai Yao returned home and learned what had happened. She knew that she had been deceived, but there was no way to get the money back. It is feared that this kind of scam has victimized more than just the Cai family. Parents in this city are advised to be careful.</p>
<h3>Local Opium Dealer Arrested and Sentenced</h3>
<p>Li Shugui, a Chinese detective of the Narcotics Department of the Public Settlement Municipal Council, received a tip-off that he arrested four opium dealers, Guangdong residents Lin Da, Zheng Huilin, Wei Ganting, and Song Guozhi, at the Great China Hotel No. 208 and Avenue Joffre No. 275 and other places. Sixty-five taels of opium and fifty-five yuan in cash with secret marks were seized. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court and charged with selling drugs. Judge Feng presided over the trial and sentenced them to the appropriate penalties. The evidence was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Two Drunks Fight</h3>
<p>Chen Arong, 18, a local resident, lives upstairs at the Paris Theater on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Last night at 6:30 p.m., she and her friend Yao drank too much at home. Both were drunk and got into an argument, which led to a fight. Chen Arong's head was fractured, and her left eye was also severely injured. She was taken to the hospital for treatment. Her life is in critical condition.</p>

<h3>Case of American Beaten by Japanese Military Police; U.S. Considers Action; Whether to Protest to the Japanese Depends on the Fleet Commander's Decision</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that regarding the case of the beating of Russell, an employee of the U.S. Naval Purchasing Office in Shanghai, by Japanese military police on Wednesday morning, the U.S. authorities will protest to the Japanese authorities if Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet, decides to do so. However, since the admiral left Shanghai on the U.S. ship Luzon yesterday morning, he will not return until next week.</p>
<p>Before he returns</p>
<p>, any protest will not occur within a few days. The admiral is fully aware of the situation and will be able to investigate the matter before he returns to Shanghai. According to reports, at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning, an American boat docked at Pier No. 4 in Pudong, carrying items to be loaded onto the U.S. ship Luzon. A</p>
<p>Japanese military police</p>
<p>Officer from Taiwan boarded the boat to inspect it. A U.S. Navy sentry guarding the goods ordered him to leave the boat immediately. At that time, Russell also arrived on the scene and ordered the Japanese to leave immediately. The Japanese refused and punched Russell. Russell then forcibly made the Japanese disembark. Municipal Council Inspector Harper happened to be on the shore. At that time, the</p>
<p>Director of the U.S. Naval Purchasing Office, Chuan Chu,</p>
<p>And Municipal Council Deputy Director-General Robertson, after receiving a phone call, rushed to the scene one after another. After asking the Japanese about everything, they released him. According to the Japanese military authorities yesterday, the case is expected to be resolved peacefully.</p>
<h3>Large Packages on the Longhai Railway Temporarily Suspended for Acceptance</h3>
<p>Packages to Tongshan, Kaifeng, Shangqiu, and various places along the Longhai Railway in northern Jiangsu via Tongshan, which were previously resumed for acceptance, are now suspended due to transportation difficulties.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues License to Huizhong Bank</h3>
<p>The Huizhong Bank in this city was established the earliest with capital of 300,000 yuan, and it has long been a leader in the banking industry. The head office is located at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road. In serving the community, it always prioritizes the welfare of its customers, does not make false appeals, and does not engage in speculative businesses. Last year, it spent a large sum of money to build a large building in the busiest commercial district of the concession, at the corner of Shilu and Erma Road, and opened the Shilu branch. This autumn, to facilitate the people in western Shanghai, it also surveyed a new site at the intersection of Connaught Road and Hardoon Road and established a West District branch. Recently, it was learned that the general manager of the bank, Mr. Huang Yuzhai, in order to further consolidate the bank's foundation and expand its business, registered with the Ministries of Finance and Economy in Chongqing. In August of this year, he received Bank Business License No. 304 from the Ministry of Finance and Registration License No. 180 from the Ministry of Economy. The registered businesses include ten items: (1) various deposits, (2) various loans, (3) various remittances and bills of exchange, (4) various bill discounts, (5) trading in securities (6) agent design and sales of real estate, (7) agent collection and trust funds, (8) entering into special events with national banks and other banks and money houses, (9) safekeeping services, (10) all other businesses inherent to the banking industry. Among the banks in China that have obtained bank licenses from both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy, the Huizhong Bank is considered the first.</p>

<h3>Grain; Foreign Rice Arrives Daily; Rice Prices Rise Daily; If There Is No Way to Sanction Manipulation; It Is Unlikely That Rice Prices Will Fall</h3>
<p>This time, rice prices have risen again due to the impact of the "control" of the source of supply in the mainland. The source of supply suddenly became scarce, leading to consecutive days of skyrocketing prices, breaking the 40 yuan mark directly. Ordinary粳 rice has even reached 45-46 yuan. In just a few days, whether it is 粳 or 尖 rice, all have soared by as much as 6-7 yuan. Judging by the rising trend, if there is no hope of unblocking the source of supply, and if there is no way to sanction manipulation, it is unlikely that rice prices will fall. The rice industry is only engaged in promoting the implementation of industry regulations, all kinds of arguments, nothing more than to shirk responsibility. They are familiar with making cocoons, and hoarding and manipulating as before. Yesterday, the sources of supply from various roads arrived in the Sujia area with 13 or 14 cars of goods, and 2 or 3 ships of Qingjiao goods from Hexia. When the market opened in the morning, all the brokers rushed to inquire, following the aftereffects of the previous day. The sellers hoarded and refused to release their goods, and rice prices rose steadily. Ordinary 粳 rice once reached 47-48 yuan, 昆粳 rice also reached 46-47 yuan, 簿稻 rice reached 44 yuan, and 芦羊尖 rice reached 42-43 yuan, all of which increased sharply by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous market. Although prices have risen, it is ultimately felt that the huge price of nearly 50 yuan will inevitably be difficult to sell in the future, and the brokers also feel it is difficult to handle, so they stopped buying. Those who bought in the past then sold at a high price, and the supply was greater than the demand, so the prices of various goods fell step by step by about 1-2 yuan. At the close of the market, ordinary 粳 rice was 46.5 yuan, 昆粳 rice was 45.5 yuan, and 簿稻 rice was 42-43 yuan, an increase of about half a yuan to nearly a yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>The source of 籼 rice is gradually increasing. Although there are delays en route and cumbersome procedures, the vendors transport a lot of it because of its high profits. In the future, it should arrive in port continuously. However, due to the influence of the sharp rise in 粳 rice and the heat of speculation yesterday morning, the price once rose by one yuan, but due to the foreign rice pressing down, the market then fell back, resulting in only a gain of half a yuan. High 无籼 rice was opened at 39 yuan.</p>
<p>Orders for foreign rice continue to be negotiated. The Grain Merchants Association sent out a telegram with a price of 43-44 yuan, but the foreign merchants said that the telegram price had risen and that they would only discuss it at 48-49 yuan. Therefore, no formal agreement has been reached on the new transaction. Currently, in the early market in Saigon, merchants rarely show samples. Only general returning goods are traded with each other. The market fluctuated by only one yuan. The initial price of short-grain rice was 39 yuan, 38.8 yuan, and the closing price was 38.5 yuan. The initial price of long-grain rice was 38.5 yuan, and the closing price was 38.2 yuan, 37.9 yuan, an increase of only 3-4 cents to half a yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice arrives one after another. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yong Sheng ship brought 12,923 bags from Hong Kong, and the Taikoo Co.'s Taiyuan ship brought 13,134 bags from Hong Kong, a total of 26,057 bags, which are being unloaded. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Factories Release Stock, Receive Wheat; Qingdao Uses Oil to Exchange for Flour</h3>
<p>After flour mill disks experienced another surge the day before yesterday, they have gradually become more stable. It is observed that wheat raw materials have seen repeated high prices recently. Due to rising costs, each factory insists on its selling price. However, aside from South Asia, where sales are still good, others find the price too high and cannot afford to purchase. Moreover, places like Qingdao find transportation unprofitable. However, since the Japanese have taken control of peanut oil, only Qingdao and similar places can export small quantities. Even then, they must exchange equivalent goods for exports. This is why some can only exchange oil for flour, thus providing a small outlet for flour. Other places like Tianjin and Qinhuangdao do not have strong demand. Although some is transported there, it is not comparable to the past, as it has long become a Japanese flour market. Therefore, customer sales are not as enthusiastic as in the past few days. The total transaction volume is estimated at over 30,000 bags, with local and external customers each accounting for half. Second-grade flour continues to open at eight yuan and three jiao for the original disk, while return-cargo train flour still requires eight yuan and six jiao. Japanese factory Phoenix brand flour opened at eight yuan and three jiao for December initially, but quickly dropped to one yuan, seven or eight fen. Recycled Dragon Gate brand flour opened at seven yuan, seven jiao and a half. The market situation seems weak. Furthermore, 7,500 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin, and another 5,500 bags are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The wheat market situation has become expensive again, as factories have implemented a price of thirteen yuan and five jiao to purchase, but the supply remains scarce. As a result, Fuxin only secured 600 bags, and Fufeng only opened 300 bags. Wheat from Suzhou, Changzhou, Yangzhou, and other places is all opening at thirteen yuan and five jiao. The market offerings include ten cartloads of Guandian wheat and Bengbu Hua wheat. The highest price is thirteen yuan, six jiao and eight fen, setting a new high.</p>
<p>The oil market was relatively calm yesterday, with few transactions. However, the supply source is still not strong, and those hoarding goods are reluctant to release them easily.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Beans Attract Hoarding Interest; Afternoon Sees Another Rebound</h3>
<p>The yellow bean market situation saw initial calmness in the morning, as customer sales were stagnant and hoarders were observing. Local vendors had full inventories, leading to market stability. In the afternoon, hoarders from various groups returned to inquire, and beans with dry bodies, high quality, and sales channels to oil factories saw another increase, resulting in a rise of two to three jiao. Currently, the overall situation is that supply and sales are roughly equal. Although the bottom inventory is not thick, the supply source is quite smooth. Yesterday, the total market included six to seven hundred bags of Dingjiazhou beans, priced from seventeen yuan and five jiao to eighteen yuan and two jiao and a half; four cartloads of Nanjing beans, priced from sixteen yuan and eight jiao to seventeen yuan, three jiao and a half; over five hundred bags of Wuhu beans, priced at sixteen yuan, eight or nine jiao; three cartloads of Bengbu beans, priced at eighteen yuan to eighteen yuan, three jiao; over six hundred bags of Chongming sand yellow, priced at seventeen yuan, seven jiao to eighteen yuan and two fen; and fifty bags of Pinghu Du beans, priced at eighteen yuan, seven jiao and a half.</p>
<p>On the 9th, 5,968 bags of beans, 980 bags of raw kernels, 2,785 barrels of raw oil, and 560 cans of sesame oil were shipped to Hong Kong. Also, on the 8th, 600 cans of leather oil were shipped from Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Market Bulls Take Profits</h3>
<p>The cash "cooked red" gray market situation yesterday was slightly calmer due to the stabilization of the foreign exchange market. However, a certain money exchange business, which had been consistently buying in the past few days, came to take profits, with a volume of over a thousand taels. Despite small declines, the bulls continued to add positions from time to time. As a result, it only fell by ten yuan. The future may have temporary fluctuations, but there is no risk of a complete collapse. Looking at the day's proceedings, the morning opened unchanged at four thousand one hundred and eighty yuan. It then rose by five yuan. Subsequently, due to a certain money exchange business continuously selling on behalf of large clients to take profits, and the foreign exchange market being firm at the time, although securities firms and other groups had demand, it was ultimately overwhelmed by selling pressure. It once retreated to a low price of four thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. Fortunately, the foreign exchange market softened, and it was heard that HSBC was buying, triggering a buying frenzy. Certain gold shops and retail investors entered the market to compete for sales, so it once reached four thousand one hundred and ninety yuan. However, the good times did not last. At noon, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the buyers who had rushed in to take advantage of the situation quickly returned to selling. By the time of the noon close, it only reported four thousand one hundred and seventy yuan. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market was stagnant, and the fluctuations were extremely flat. As a result, it was similar to the noon close. Trading was brisk throughout the day, at two thousand seven to eight hundred taels. Jewelry shops discounted small five yuan, and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>"Cooked red" falls back ten yuan</p>
<p>From the morning opening, each bar (ten taels) initially opened with a relatively stable situation due to a flat foreign exchange market report. The first transaction was a money exchange business purchasing one tael from a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and eighty yuan, with no change from the previous day. Shortly afterward, securities firms came to buy in slightly, raising it by five yuan and purchasing ten taels from a cash gold shop for four thousand one hundred and eighty-five yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange business sold on behalf of a large client, with a significant amount, and at one point the incoming demand was sluggish, immediately pressing down thirty-five yuan. The money exchange business sold thirty taels to a jewelry shop for four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Later, a certain jewelry shop bought on behalf of a client, and the sellers temporarily stopped, so it rebounded by twenty yuan. The money exchange business transacted twenty taels with each other for four thousand one hundred and seventy yuan. After this, a certain money exchange business started selling again, only releasing one hundred taels, and the price had already been pressed down to four thousand one hundred and fifty-five yuan. At that time, another money exchange business's intake turned strong, and securities firms also followed, so it rebounded by twenty yuan, reaching four thousand one hundred and seventy-five yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange business came to sell heavily again, and the foreign exchange market also reported a firm tone, so it fell sharply by forty-five yuan again. The money exchange business sold one tael to a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. At around eleven o'clock, the foreign exchange market suddenly softened, and buyers rushed in, instantly jumping up eighteen yuan. Later, with the addition of a certain gold shop and securities firms and retail investors competing to buy, it rose by another forty yuan, with the securities firms buying fifty taels from a certain money exchange business and the money exchange businesses transacting twenty taels with each other, all for four thousand one hundred and ninety yuan. At noon, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the buying frenzy subsided. Generally, many scalpers released their positions at high prices, and at the same time, a certain gold shop also took profits late in the game. Soon it dropped by thirty yuan, with the gold shops transacting ten taels with each other for four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan. When the market was about to close, a certain money exchange business came to shout to buy again, and soon it rose by ten yuan, with the money exchange businesses transacting two taels with each other for four thousand one hundred and seventy yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the initial opening saw the money exchange business continue to raise the price, opening ten yuan higher, with the money exchange business purchasing ten taels from a gold shop for four thousand one hundred and eighty yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business turned to selling intentions and released dozens of taels, and the jewelry shops also slightly sold out, falling by fifteen yuan. The money exchange business sold ten taels to a securities firm for four thousand one hundred and sixty-five yuan. At that time, the securities firms continued to buy in, so it rose again to four thousand one hundred and eighty yuan. Afterward, due to the gold shop and a certain jewelry shop releasing, it fell slightly to four thousand one hundred and sixty yuan. Later, another securities firm entered the market to absorb it, so it rose by five yuan, with the securities firm purchasing twenty taels from a money exchange business for four thousand one hundred and seventy yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell back ten yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day saw fluctuations of sixty yuan. The selling price of cash gold shops' own-brand gold was one yuan higher than "cooked red," and the purchase price was reduced by twenty yuan. The current standard gold was over fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Marked Down Small Five Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael was still suspended at four hundred and twenty-five yuan by Datonghang. After ten o'clock, it was marked down by a small five yuan. There were no changes after this. As a result, Datonghang changed its suspension to four hundred and twenty yuan. The new counterparts were at the same price, and the purchase price was reduced by fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Lingers; Hong Kong Banks Sell Sterling, Buy Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The off-market market for sterling and U.S. dollars showed a return to a lingering state, with narrow fluctuations. The process was initially loose, then tight, and finally flat. The morning opening saw sterling slightly loose, at 0.15625, while the dollar remained unchanged, influenced by the 75 point drop in the sterling-dollar exchange rate. The situation was calm after the opening. It was not until after 9:30 that it was heard that Hong Kong Electric was selling sterling and slightly buying dollars, but at that time it was slightly hardening, reaching 4 1/2 points, and 7.3475. Subsequently, HSBC came to absorb it, and Japanese banks and textile merchants followed, so the market suddenly changed and tightened to 4 4375 points and 7.25. At noon, the scalpers were satisfied and returned to flat, so the noon close was similar to the morning opening. The afternoon situation was flat and lifeless. There were no changes until the evening close. Sterling was still at 4 484375 points, and the dollar was still at 7.28125. As a result, sterling was 0.15625 looser than the previous day, while the dollar was unchanged. The trend of futures was no different from the spot.</p>
<p>Textile Merchants Still Settling In</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's dog bars, both near and far terms, contracted by 125. New York silver prices remained flat, London raw gold stagnated, and exchange rates for sterling against the U.S. dollar, Shanghai dollar, and French franc were all flat. The U.S. dollar fell by 75 against the pound, fell by five points against the Shanghai dollar, and fell slightly by 25 against the French franc. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was sterling at 4 484375 points, and the U.S. dollar at 7.28125, with sterling being 0.15625 looser and the U.S. dollar unchanged compared to the previous closing, due to the exchange rate being reported as contracted. The market situation was quiet after the opening, and transactions were rare. When HSBC's listed price was announced and did not move, the silver balancing tax was announced to be slightly lower by one point. After this, Hong Kong Electric suddenly came to sell sterling and slightly buy U.S. dollars, and the head position seemed to be abundant, so it was slightly hard. Hong Kong Electric sold spot sterling at 484375 points and half a point to foreign banks and importers. At the same time, Hong Kong Electric bought spot U.S. dollars at 7.3125 from a certain bank. Later, the U.S. dollar once loosened to 7.34375. Subsequently, HSBC suddenly became interested in buying, which led to Japanese banks and textile merchants buying in, so the situation slightly turned soft. HSBC absorbed spot U.S. dollars at 7.3125 from a certain bank, and this month's sterling at 4 4375 points from a Japanese bank. Following this, textile merchants also settled this month's U.S. dollars at 7.25 with foreign banks. At that time, the spot U.S. dollar also shouted over 7.25. At noon, the scalpers gradually decreased, and the situation suddenly became stable. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was sterling at 4 484375 points, and the U.S. dollar at 7.28125, with no change compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Speculators Slightly Enter Far-Term Contracts</p>
<p>Transactions were extremely rare in the afternoon, and spot sterling and U.S. dollars were rarely traded. It was only heard that speculators Cheng came to buy in foreign banks' January U.S. dollars for 7.1875, and the price also lacked honor or disgrace. Extended to the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was still sterling at 4 484375 points, and the U.S. dollar was also still at 7.28125. This month's sterling was at 4 46875 points, and the U.S. dollar was at 7.25. January sterling was at 4 453125 points, and the U.S. male was at 7.15625. As a result, each of the current sterling terms was loosened by 0.15625, while the U.S. dollar had no distinction between vehicles.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Dollar Tight, Sterling Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 8th Telegram: The market opened flat this morning. Sterling's spot and futures remained unchanged. The U.S. dollar spot contracted by 0.0625, to 24.3125 yuan.

<h3>Securities: Telephone Stocks See Large Fluctuations</h3>
<p>——The Legend of Jardine Matheson's Dividend——</p>
<p>Yesterday's securities off-market situation was caused by reports that problems had arisen again with the eighth installment of principal and interest due at the end of January next year. Although this was personal speculation and not of great importance, the fragile hearts of the people were inevitably affected slightly. It is still far away, and it is too early to be concerned about such things. Today is the date for the eighth lottery for Class E, so it is necessary to calculate the profit from winning the lottery. The future may not be able to quickly escape the hovering state. The price was still firm yesterday morning, without much fluctuation. Class C was still standing firm outside seven yuan. There was quite a bit of buying in No. 20. The selling atmosphere was more intense in the afternoon. There were more sales of Tiansheng and No. 38, but No. 20 continued to buy. There were also purchases of No. 35 and Tongkang Hengfu. Class C retreated to the seven-yuan mark again. Because of today's lottery, Class E was doing both linked lottery and ex-lottery at two different market prices at the same time yesterday afternoon. The difference in large prize rights was about one yuan. Yesterday's market price resulted in a small five cents, one jiao to four jiao. The volume of transactions was in the range of 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions included thirty shares of the Great China Rubber Factory, priced at sixty-five yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market, although the wind of profit-taking was very strong, was not greatly affected. The trend turned lively in the afternoon. Jardine Matheson, Ruiyong, Telephone, Steel Industry, and International Trust stocks accounted for most of the day's trading. The price of telephone stocks fluctuated greatly due to conflicting news, reaching a low of nineteen yuan and four jiao, and then returning to twenty-one yuan and two jiao and a half. There were buyers at this closing price. Interest in rubber stocks increased sharply. Several stocks that had been almost forgotten recently were once again favored. Although the transaction amount was not huge daily, it also included a variety of stocks.</p>
<p>London, 7th Telegram: The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable today. There were no changes in the upper and lower gears of each bond. The listed market price of shares of famous British Far East companies, HSBC opened on average and reported a rise. HSBC bank shares rose by half a pound each, with London-registered shares at £82.5, and Hong Kong-registered shares at £84.5. The Kaiping Coal Mine small registered shares rose by six pence to 18 shillings and six pence. The rest was flat.</p>
<p>The 1939 dividend of Shanghai Telephone Company, at six jiao per share, is scheduled to be distributed on December 27.</p>
<p>Also, the 1939 dividend of Jardine Matheson Spinning &amp; Weaving Co., Ltd. is rumored to be first distributed at one yuan and seven jiao and five fen per share.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: U.S. Cotton Export Subsidies Reduced for the Second Time; Morale Recovers; Manufacturers Enthusiastic About Buying Cotton</h3>
<p>The trading of local cotton is still lively, with white bale, grass bale, and wooden frame machine-picked cotton being bought and sold among each other. Next is Tongzhou cotton. As for factory intakes, they are not very strong, but those who want to collect a large amount of spot goods fear that the market price will be difficult. This is because most counterparts are optimistic. Although the price of Lang cotton fell sharply today, the rise of U.S. cotton is dramatic, and it is reported that the export subsidy for U.S. cotton has been reduced to 40 pounds per pound, so morale has recovered. However, due to consecutive days of rising prices, some have made significant profits and have temporarily not taken action to collect as much as possible, so the rise is not strong, rising by two or three yuan compared to the previous day. The source of northern Jiangsu is 2,471 bales of Tonghua cotton, 390 bales of Changyinsha, and 1,765 bales of Beisha. There are 230 bales of cotton shipped to Hong Kong today. The current cotton transaction situation is listed below.</p>

<p>Today Yaohua Banned in Shanghai, but dozens of small bales of cotton are shipped daily from Tongchong Qihai and other places. Indian cotton has not been seen in Shanghai for the past few months. It is heard that the Italian ship Fu Er Bi (transliteration) has arrived in Shanghai, transporting 140 tons of cotton from Egypt, or more than 1,000 pieces. The ship is docked at the Hongshuntai Wharf for unloading, (ancestor).</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, is exceptionally quiet, but the market situation is unusually firm. Spot trading is very active. Overseas cotton merchants are quieter due to the reduction of export subsidies. Later, due to Wall Street's extremely strong purchases in the market, the closing price rose by more than 20 pounds. We have just received a telegram from the United States that the U.S. government will change the export subsidy to 40 pounds per pound starting at midnight today (previously 150 pounds per pound, which was recently changed to 75 pounds per pound), so the selling price of U.S. cotton overseas has risen a lot, but it is still cheaper than Indian cotton. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell by more than ten rupees, which is slightly closer to U.S. cotton. Yesterday, Egyptian cotton rose by more than 20 pounds, and Liverpool rose by six or seven pence. The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai, a British factory purchased 5,000 to 6,000 bales of U.S. cotton, and Chinese and Japanese factories had a total of more than 10,000 bales of transactions. In the future, the transaction of U.S. cotton may be temporarily deserted. The market price of U.S. cotton yesterday, converted at the U.S. exchange rate of 7.25, the delivery price is as follows,</p>
<p>20 Count U.S. Middling 230.00</p>
<p>20 Count U.S. Middling Lower Grade 225.40</p>
<p>31 Count U.S. Middling 137.35</p>
<p>31 Count U.S. Middling Lower Grade 230.90</p>
<p>42 Count U.S. Middling 239.15</p>
<p>42 Count U.S. Middling Lower Grade 232.75</p>
<h3>Consumption of 10 Counts Has Decreased; The Rise of the Yarn Market Is Circuitous</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to advance, and the situation is stable and quiet. As for actual sales, although Hong Kong merchants do not have wholesale transactions for coarse and fine yarn, sporadic purchases have not been interrupted, so morale is high. At the same time, although overseas Indian cotton has fallen, the rise of U.S. cotton is strong, and many parties are optimistic and want to further advance. Unfortunately, the consumption of 20-count yarn is not very strong, so the rise of the yarn market is still circuitous.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened with U.S. cotton rising sharply, but Indian cotton has seen a rebound. However, the current key is U.S. cotton, because the price of Indian cotton is higher than U.S. cotton, and the calculation has long been impossible. Temporary decline does not cause problems for the yarn market. The opening price of yarn rose by five yuan, and the current price of 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse is 708 yuan. Soon it reached ten yuan, and then the demand for 20-count yarn from Guangdong merchants was not strong, and it hovered between ten yuan for a long time. The closing price was also flat. The transaction statistics for half a day totaled 2,605 bales, with the market price of 20-count Double Horse rising by six yuan, Tekin City rising by three yuan and a half, Tiannv rising by two yuan, and Double Earth rising by four yuan. Today, 80 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 10 pieces were shipped to Haiphong, and 310 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Review of "A Combined Edition of the Ci Yuan Supplement and Continued Supplement"</h3>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<p>Since its publication, the Ci Yuan Supplement and Continued Supplement have been popular everywhere and have long been well-received. Recently, the font has been reduced, the format has been enlarged, total page numbers have been added, and it has been combined and corrected, bringing three large volumes together into one volume, making it convenient for checking and carrying.</p>
<p>However, given this combined edition, I feel that there seems to have been a need for a strict correction beforehand. Now, the publication period of the second Continued Ci Yuan may be far away, and this opportunity for combination can be used to save some effort in compiling and printing the second Continued Ci Yuan. At the same time, we can obtain a perfect fixed edition in the years before the publication of the second Continued Ci Yuan. Therefore, slight flaws, such as the absence of "East Mountain Resurgence" and "Madame Curie," the error on page one, fourth line, that "water chestnut" is a "algae plant," and the delay in citing the "One Slice" of page two from the Book of Wei (for example, the "Spring and Autumn of Lu Bu" and the "Huainanzi" also have it), seem to be corrected and supplemented in this edition.</p>
<p>According to the "Explanation of the Combined Edition," this combination is not just a simple combination, but also includes the "addition" of "missing words," the "correction" of "errors," the "revision" of "sentences," and the "correction" of "nouns" in the main text. In a thick combined edition of Ci Yuan, it is really difficult to find it. Therefore, we do not know what kind of sentences need to be revised, what is the standard of revision; what kind of nouns need to be corrected, and what is the standard of correction. However, I feel that some larger places that involve two or more items also need to be revised and corrected. These have not been revised in several examples.</p>
<p>First: In the Continued Supplement, words and phrases that "supplement" the same meaning in the main edition should be merged into the corresponding common items, and the other items should be noted with the words "see a certain item for details." For example, "cucumber" can be merged into "yellow melon."</p>
<p>Second: For different entries with the same source, one can be abolished and replaced with the note "see a certain entry for details." For example, the "cut nails" on page noon-19 (originally in the Continued Supplement) can be merged into the "no intact eggs under an overturned nest" on page shen-113 (originally in the main edition); the "crushed mortar" on page shen-6 (originally in the Continued Supplement) can be merged into the "yellow silk young woman" on page hai-67 (originally in the main edition). "Potassium chromate" on page you-144 (originally in the main edition), "Potassium chromate" on page you-108 (originally in the main edition), and "Potassium permanganate" on page hai-20 (originally in the Continued Supplement) originally belonged to one thing, but the descriptions under each entry are slightly different, which makes it difficult for beginners to solve them. In addition, "Potassium permanganate" also notes "see Potassium chromate," but does not note "see Potassium permanganate." It is conceivable that the "heavy" and "over" entries do not "see" "high." It goes without saying that such items should be merged. Even if it cannot be merged, the items in the main edition that are related to the items in the Continued Supplement should also be noted to see a certain item, so as to be "mutually" visible, which is thoughtful.</p>
<p>Among the biological terms, the main edition does not note the Western names of the classification scholars, but the Continued Supplement does. After the merger, they are quite inconsistent, which seems to be a drawback. For example, the main edition has rhynchocoela, caudata, and marsupials, which are clearly distinguishable from the continued edition's unguiculata, podophora, loricata, pulmones, pterygota, tubulifera, and conifera. The names of the class, order, family, and genus are not as good as the species names. It does not matter much to omit the common Western names of species, but the names of class, order, family, and genus should be treated the same.</p>
<p>Incidentally, it is best to add a transliteration comparison table to the Ci Yuan to avoid the difficulty of wanting to check foreign personal and place names but not knowing how to translate the first character. Because in recent books, many foreign personal and place names are noted next to them, and the translators therefore translate them at will, without seeking precision. Therefore, it is not as good as the situation when the Ci Yuan was first published.</p>
<p>In short, it is rare to have this combination and publication of the Ci Yuan Supplement and Continued Supplement under wartime conditions. At the same time, it is probably not possible to do what I have hoped for, which is almost a rewriting, so this combined edition of the Ci Yuan Supplement and Continued Supplement is only a "combined edition" as its name indicates, a mixture of the main edition and the Continued Supplement, not a compound of them.</p>
<h3>Leading the Way - A Memoir of the Xiangbei Campaign</h3>
<p>— Fen Lang</p>
<p>Due to the urgency of the war situation, the Brigade Headquarters was ordered to send two more regiments of troops to the front line for reinforcement. Furthermore, Brigade Commander Wang assigned me the task of "leading the way" this time. I rushed to the regimental headquarters stationed in the countryside and conveyed this urgent order. Coincidentally, the regimental commander was out drilling. Without further delay, I discussed it briefly with Deputy Regimental Commander Xu, and we decided to depart at eight o'clock tonight, passing over Hulu Mountain to reach Changsha. We would wait for further orders from the Brigade Headquarters in Changsha before advancing to the front line.</p>
<p>After dinner, I went outside and hired two porters to carry two loads of hand grenades. We set off towards Hulu Mountain, closely followed by a torrent of iron and blood—more than two thousand brothers. In my hand, I held a small torch, emitting a faint light, illuminating the winding mountain path. We quickened our pace and plunged into the gloomy valley.</p>
<p>Occasionally, turning my head back, I saw thousands of faint flashlight beams flickering amidst the dark, dense cliffs, winding and circling from one side to the other. Fragments of footsteps rustled down from the jungle, mingling with the night wind sliding down the hillside, all rushing towards the distant valley.</p>
<p>The two porters took very large strides, sometimes I could barely keep up. I dragged my swollen, stiff legs, struggling to keep pace on the mountainside. Suddenly, a violent echo resounded, and I knew we were in a deep, dark valley, so I proceeded even more cautiously. The cliffs were covered with moss, slippery as if they hadn't seen the sun in millennia. We had to change our hasty steps to crawling.</p>
<p>I felt quite exhausted and asked the porters:</p>
<p>"How far is it to Changsha?"</p>
<p>"Not far now. Follow the Chaodao Mountain Road, pass a few cliffs, and when you go downhill, you can see the lights of Changsha city."</p>
<p>The porter's tone was loud and clear; I knew he must not be tired at all. From the dim light of the torch, I could vaguely see his spirited expression.</p>
<p>After climbing over a cliff, we rushed into a ravine. The small torch flashed through the woods and between the rocks, and we turned into another cliff. At this time, no one wanted to speak; we just kept moving our legs as hard as we could, like untethered wild horses galloping into the boundless expanse.</p>
<p>Crossing this cliff, we saw the mountain path gradually sloping downwards. Just around the foot of the mountain, we saw a flickering light in the distance.</p>
<p>"That must be Changsha!" I thought to myself, and catching up with the porters, I took three steps in two.</p>
<p>As dawn broke, our company reached the military headquarters in Changsha to report. I also completed my task of "leading the way" with the two porters. After the porters put down the hand grenade boxes from their shoulders, I asked them,</p>
<p>"Was this leading the way tiring?"</p>
<p>"I didn't feel anything at all. On the contrary, my body feels much more refreshed," the porter said, shrugging his shoulders, with a chuckle they hadn't heard in a long time.</p>
<h3>The Beauty of Justice</h3>
<p>— Ding Ti</p>
<p>Is beauty independent? According to Croce's school of thought, beauty is naturally considered isolated, a disinterested form of contemplation, a pure intuition. "The deep heart masters the flowers and trees, and far-reaching thoughts reach the wind and clouds." As long as its inherent image is conveyed through a suitable form, immersing you in the realm of intuition, it is nothing but beauty. This error clearly ignores the social nature of art; it fails to understand that the beauty of art is built on the foundation of society as a whole. To try to divide it with a knife or scissors is simply impossible. The existence of art is not yours or mine, nor is it a "superman" or "super-object" transcendent above society. It is a universal resonance within society, like sound waves or heat conduction in the air. Do you say it is independent? The momentary existence is indeed isolated, but we must never say that a pure image that transcends language has already accomplished the function of beauty. The important value of beauty still needs to be expressed in language, to have form, to make art spacious in time and enduring, this is true beauty. Then social conditions immediately follow; beauty, in terms of appreciating itself, is certainly isolated, but in terms of its conditions of existence, it cannot escape the connection with society as a whole.</p>
<p>We may not agree that literature is subservient to morality, but we should agree that the highest artistic beauty is justice. According to Yang Xiong and Cao Zhi, they both regarded the beauty of art too casually. One said it was a trivial skill, not something a strong man would do; the other said it was "insufficient to promote great righteousness and show it to future generations." As a result, the beauty in their eyes became a peach pit boat or a fly-head carving on ivory, meant only for people to play with and caress. One phrase replaced the evidence of the era, and the articles were hidden and selected. Besides being novel and beautiful, there was nothing else. If this were really the case, it would naturally be no wonder that a strong man would not do it. But we must ask: is this kind of artistic beauty really true beauty? Sadly, this kind of thing is not worthy of being called beauty! Truly valuable beauty must be dynamic, vibrant, and represent the intention of justice. No matter how the origin of art is explained, it is a fact that labor came before art. The pioneering of wilderness in ancient times, the competition of hunting, the wars between totems, all illustrate the struggle to complete life. From ancient times to the present, the potential of life has been lurking in the tide of literary evolution, and this potential dominates all the complex emotions of mankind. Whether floating on the surface of the waves or tumbling into the bottom of the vortex, it will not be dead or static, unless this era is dead and static.</p>
<p>Being dynamic and vibrant is not enough; it further requires the movement of justice. The rampancy of evil and the tension of drawn swords and cocked crossbows may have movement and vitality, but this is not beauty. A healthy work of art never allows it to be mixed in. The beauty of a healthy art is completely entrusted to the empathy of the times. In addition to the beauty and ugliness of reality, we should also have a kind of imagined beauty and ugliness. After the fusion of the two, there will be a more accurate evaluation of the real society, promoting the good and belittling the evil. Unknowingly, art has completed the highest instruction and symbol. This instruction and symbol is a beauty—the beauty of justice. This statement does not conflict with Croce's school of thought. Isolation still exists during appreciation, but the result truly becomes what is said in "Classic on Literature": "The great cause of governing the country, the grand event of immortality." The greatness of time and space, this is true greatness.</p>
<p>The beauty of art has a moral character, although from the beginning its original intention was not to preach. If you understand this sentence, then I can specifically point out how the beauty of justice exists. In terms of form, this is similar to what "The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons" calls "style and substance." "If the words are upright and straightforward, then style and substance will be formed." Isn't "upright and straightforward" the image of the beauty of justice reflected in the form? It is exactly the opposite of the pre-Song literature criticized by Pei Ziye's "On Carving Insects": "Its rise is profound, its ambition is strong, skillful and able to be essential, hidden and able to be deep." Its greatness, in addition to revealing the original and vigorous power of mankind, can also establish a lofty and reasonable standard. Countless emotions, directly and indirectly, are dominated and influenced by this great potential. There is an invisible majesty, an unchangeable image and fixed knowledge, which can be found in the lines and between the lines. To be specific, this may be called style and substance. Style and substance is a perfect thing that symbolizes the beauty of justice.</p>
<p>Describe the beauty of flowers and plants? Sing the praises of the ivory tower? Erotic beauty, leisurely beauty... we can put down our pens. Let the rapid current that has been lurking under the whirlpool for thousands of years surge to the surface of the river, become waves, and establish lofty style and substance. This is true beauty, great and just. Beauty need not be sought elsewhere. Flaubert tells us: "It is nothing but justice."</p>
<h3>Brave Words Before Battle</h3>
<p>— By Byron, Translated by Pin Pin</p>
<p>Soldiers and officers! If spear and sword pierce me,</p>
<p>When I lead the people to charge,</p>
<p>Do not worry about my corpse under your feet, though I am the leader:</p>
<p>Stick your weapons in the land to swear an oath!</p>
<p>If, holding my shield and my bow,</p>
<p>You, as my comrades, flee in battle,</p>
<p>Then chop me up!</p>
<p>I have always made the enemy flee in disarray.</p>
<p>Say goodbye to others, but we will never betray each other,</p>
<p>You are my glorious successors, my sincere brothers!</p>
<p>May the country prosper and its power spread,</p>
<p>Be determined to die gloriously, today!</p>

<h3>Chen Charlie's Troubles</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Naughty children - volunteer to form detective teams</p>
<p>Activities everywhere - people can't stand the disturbance</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, Sherlock Holmes detective films were popular in Hollywood, but recently they have turned into the era of Chen Charlie. Chen Charlie is a Chinese name, and his appearance and style are also orientalized. Warner Oland, who was famous for playing the great detective Chen Charlie, was very popular for a while. Unfortunately, Mr. Hua died of a sudden illness a few years ago, and the film industry was greatly disappointed. Not long after, 20th Century Fox found a new "Chen Charlie" named Sidney Toler. After appearing in a few scenes, many boys, just like our country's children who are fascinated by martial arts swordsmen, wanted to worship him as their "old man" and learn detective techniques. The most clamorous were a group of naughty children in Honolulu, who voluntarily formed a "Charlie Chen Junior Police" and hailed the great Chen Charlie as their honorary captain. They shouldered their burdens, went around asking for information, and investigating materials, and submitted detailed reports of their investigations to Chen Charlie. These little Chen Charlies took their work too seriously, and when they encountered what they considered difficult cases, they did not hesitate to puncture people's tires, smash store windows, and sometimes damage people's telephone lines in order to get to the bottom of things. After the matter was completed, they all made a "Chen Charlie investigated" mark. People were unbearable and asked Chen Charlie, several times a week. Chen Charlie wanted to resign from the title of honorary captain, but he was afraid of affecting his reputation; if this continued, he was afraid of causing a catastrophe, and he felt quite troubled.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jinrong's Performance at Tianchan Cancelled, Waiting for a Ship North</h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>It has been half a month since Zhao Jinrong stopped performing at Gengxin. The first batch of Beijing actors at Gengxin, Liang Yunqiu, Wu Suqiu, Chen Shaolin, etc., have all returned north one after another, but Jinrong is still stranded in Shanghai. Recently, news came out that Jinrong would perform a short-term performance at the Tianchan Theater in the coming days, and the theater had also invited veteran actor Wang Qingchen and young actor Zhou Xiaofang to cooperate with Zhao. The reporter visited Jinrong at her residence on Yuyuan Road yesterday to inquire about the matter of performing at Tianchan, as there was a reason for it. But Jinrong completely denied it. According to her, the Tianchan Theater did send someone to contact her, but she was invited by the Gengxin Theater, and although she had completed her contract, she was still not convenient to join another troupe. In addition, due to other relationships, she declined. Therefore, the rumor that Jinrong will perform at Tianchan is something that cannot be realized.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Zhao Jinrong was originally scheduled to perform three charity performances at the Golden Grand Theater after Wang Yurong's contract expired, at the invitation of the Jiping Guild Relief Committee and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association. The repertoire had been finalized as "The Jade Hairpin," "Yu Tang Chun," and "Fourth Son Visiting Mother." It is now learned that Yu Rong has declined the invitation from Tianchan, and also said that she will no longer participate in the three charity performances at the Golden Grand Theater. It is said that Jinrong has been in Shanghai for a long time, and her heart is eager to return. She has decided to take the Shuntian ship north in mid-month. The new actors of the Golden Grand Theater, Ye Shenglan and Guan Shengxi, etc., will take the Shuntian south. The ship is expected to arrive in port on the 14th and dock on the 16th. Jinrong will only stay in Shanghai for a week, and then she will buy a boat back to the north.</p>
<h3>Gorky's Childhood - Soon to be Released in Shanghai</h3>
<p>It has been three years since Gorky passed away. In order to commemorate this great writer, the Soviet Union has decided to put several of Gorky's famous works on the screen in terms of film.</p>
<p>Previously, "Mother" had already been filmed once as a silent film. "Twenty-One Men and One Woman," "The Lower Depths," and others were prepared for filming but were not completed. Now being filmed are his play "The Enemies" and Gorky's trilogy. Gorky's trilogy is "My Childhood," "My Apprenticeship," and "My Universities."</p>
<p>"My Childhood," under the name "Gorky's Childhood," is scheduled to open at the Great Shanghai Theater on the 13th. This will be a valuable opportunity for those who respect Gorky.</p>
<p>Dance World Writing</p>
<h3>Magazine (1)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>The Xilimen is located at the corner of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road, with three sections: the front is the ballroom, the middle is the tea room, and the back is the garden. The dance floor is rectangular and quite narrow. It is already crowded with more than ten couples dancing at the same time. The four walls are painted with more than a dozen (May Fourth) nude beauty paintings, which are probably what the hall's advertisement calls the "Nude Palace Spring Colors." The music is provided by a six-person band, five men and one woman, which has a different style compared to the large ballrooms. There are more than thirty dance hostesses, but few are beautiful. I once saw a certain newspaper praise a Li Yaping. A friend of mine had the intention of asking about her, but when he asked the waiter, the lady he pointed out had no resemblance to the one described in the newspaper in terms of appearance or figure. The drinks are of incomparable quality. The tea leaves all have stems, and the coffee is even more unpalatable. I think that the Feida next door, with its coffee and black tea, is extremely exquisite, and the price of coffee is only 50 cents and black tea is 40 cents. This hall might as well buy from its neighbor and sell it at twice the price, which would be mutually beneficial to both parties. When I suggested this to the waiter, he insisted that it was impossible, so our group had no choice but to return to our office.</p>
<p>Ru Aina of the Dametropolis has been dining with the same people recently, and the more familiar she becomes, the less she seems to have the habits of a dance hostess. A certain famous lawyer has also been frequently asking her to dance recently. According to Ru, her regular customers have no evil thoughts, which is commendable. I said that it is already very unfortunate for a woman to sell her appearance to make a living, so she should strive to move into the upper class. The only way to do this is to spend time with people from the upper class every day, and over time, it will become natural. It is like entering a room full of orchids, and after a long time, you no longer smell the fragrance. Gu Tianhong speaks the soft language of the Wu dialect, is tall and graceful, and greets people with a smile. Her aura is also quite upper-class. I told the person in charge of the Dametropolis that this woman will definitely become popular over time, so be careful not to let another family take her away.</p>
<p>Zai Lizhen has been retired from the dance hall for more than a year. Lidu has a Zhu Shanshan who is very close to Zai. The other day, when she was accompanying a guest at the counter, her eyelids were red and swollen like walnuts. When asked, she talked about Wang Tu's suicide by throwing himself into the Huangpu River. Like the rabbit mourning the fox, feeling sorry for his kind, she shed a tear of sympathy. In the past, when she accompanied dances at the Xuan Palace, she had bright eyes and white teeth, innocent and lively, and her singing voice was loud and clear. She was a promising newcomer. Later, I heard that the famous flower was transplanted to the Forbidden Garden, and she had already given birth to a daughter. Now, fortunately, she has been rescued unharmed. The affairs of her boudoir cannot be changed. However, the little girl has a narrow temperament. If she is not unruly and difficult to tame, she should be made to read more books and treated well.</p>
<h3>Playwright in "China's Mirror" (4) - Random Memories by Meibian (7)</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>With a "pop," like the sound of a champagne bottle cork popping out of the bottle, this was another customs official cutting the tightly bound rope around the "tinplate" box with scissors. The box was opened! The first thing that caught my eye was a leather jacket. I was asked about the price of this jacket, and I answered with the actual price. Not only did he have doubts, but he also thought that the price I quoted was too low to be normal. He held the leather jacket in his hand and asked other customs officials around, and everyone's answers seemed to say: "There is a need for consideration." At this time, I had to wait for their "questioning." Suddenly, one person caught sight of a large white envelope, hidden at the bottom of the box. They rushed forward, their shape like a group of wild beasts who had been hungry for a long time, discovering their food. They eagerly took it out and opened it, and a "handsome young man" was clearly present. I also seemed to have something to rely on! I hurriedly told him: "Mei Lanfang! Mei Lanfang! Who is he? You often know him! Inside this white envelope, there is nothing else except this photo and his autograph."</p>
<p>At this time, the fierce and terrifying faces of many customs officials immediately changed to a friendly attitude, completely different from before. The person who "helped me refold the leather jacket" was the person who "just now haggled with me over the price of the leather jacket." He no longer talked about the price of the leather jacket, nor did he inspect the rest of the luggage, and immediately returned to me a "luggage tag that could go directly to the Polish border."</p>
<p>With a Chinese drama utensil, he was able to completely eliminate the difficulties encountered here, and turn the customs official's "indifferent words" and "mocking expressions" into "nodding in respect." Later, when I returned to the platform, several Chinese soldiers came to protect me, asking frequently as they walked: "How is Mr. Mei doing recently? How many times have you seen Mr. Mei's plays this time?" At this time, a question arose in my mind: "May I ask, in which European and American countries is there another stage artist who can turn a suspected traveler into a VIP escorted by the police?" (The End)</p>
<h3>Ticket Industry Charity Performance</h3>
<p>— Yao</p>
<p>Two Charity Performances at the End of the Year</p>
<p>Tiwei has already written in this newspaper about the Carlton's charity performance at the end of the year, and the Golden Grand Theater will also perform three charity performances two days before closing the box, taking the same steps as the Carlton, distributing rice tickets with the proceeds from ticket sales to help the poor, and placing disaster relief in the middle of entertainment. The method is very good.</p>
<p>Among the three plays at the Golden Grand Theater, one is a Shanghai-style new play, "Nine Lives Cat Changing Prince," performed jointly by famous Shanghai amateur actors and reporters from the literary and art circles. Zhao Ruquan has been specially invited to direct, and Chen Yuelou, Zhang Guifen, Li Ruchun and others have been hired as consultants. A public banquet was held for Zhao Ruquan and Chen Yuelou at the Tiantian Hotel yesterday (7th) at 4:00 p.m., where the plot was explained on the spot, talents were recruited, and roles were assigned.</p>
<p>As for the full-length "Chain Set" at the Carlton, the roles have been finalized, and Zhou Xinfang has been invited to direct.</p>
<h3>A Fan Letter to Chen Yunshang</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>In Hollywood, whether male or female, after becoming a star, they will receive a lot of fan letters every day. The green man arrives with a thick stack, all letters sent by fans from all over the United States and even the world. This is how Hollywood's big stars are. Chinese stars are no exception, and fans often write letters to them. However, the number of letters is certainly far less than that of American stars. Here, we want to talk about a fan letter to Chen Yunshang.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang today has become the only female star in China, after winning the throne of female stars like Hu Die and Ruan Lingyu in those years, fans from all over China often write letters to her, either to compliment her or to ask her for photos.</p>
<p>Not only in various parts of China, but also in the Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, etc., Chinese films are often shown in those places, so many people will write letters to Ms. Chen, especially the overseas Chinese who account for most of the letter writers.</p>
<p>Since Chen Yunshang starred in "Mulan Joins the Army," after it was released in the United States, the three words "Chen Yunshang" were imprinted on the brains of many American fans. As a result, every foreign ship sailing from the United States to China is bound to have a large number of letters sent to Ms. Chen's film company, all written by American fans. The only reason American fans write letters to Ms. Chen is that after watching "Mulan Joins the Army," they admire her art very much, so they write letters to ask her for photos or handwritten Chinese signatures as souvenirs.</p>
<p>In order to deal with the large number of fan letters, Ms. Chen employs a female secretary at home who is fluent in both Chinese and English, and is about the same age as her. If she has news, she replies to some of the letters herself, and if she is filming, the work of replying to letters is handled by the female secretary.</p>
