<h3 id="c8">鮮明的軍事動態 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>中國軍事最近在華中方面採取攻勢，自有種種意義，而目的之一，在乎牽制日軍，使其無法多調隊伍，赴桂南作戰，然後陷日軍於孤立南甯，趨於覆亡。所以就軍事意義上講，日人所宣傳的「冬季攻勢」，並不是全面反攻；不過各地華軍的活躍。予日人以重大打擊，在戰事全局上，也確有其重要的價値。日軍佔領武漢後，一年來無法進展，就注定了她失敗的命運。誠如陳誠將軍所解釋的中國歷史上的戰爭，「自北而南是容易的，自東而西照例是困難萬分，所以從上海戰爭起，就判定了日人失敗的第一步棋子」。日本雖用了九牛二虎之力，獲得了武漢，然而「上游」的荆湘，「右臂」的襄　、始終未能控制；五月進攻鄂北。有鄂北的慘敗，十月進攻長沙，有湘北的慘敗；他受了這兩次敎訓，於是在華中方面、採取了守勢，而企圖向粵桂方面發展。從各方面零星的消息，可以推得一個結論、即日本發動侵桂，是以全力赴之，故戰爭的全局重心，也移到了南方；換言之今後戰事的重心，是在華南，而不在華中了。從日本攻下南寗後，東京的軍事發言人的聲明中，曾說明日本在華南的軍事行動。決不以南甯爲止境，「因爲日本軍隊決心要消滅西南的輸血動脈」，亦即切斷滇越鐵路與滇緬公路，停止中國的國際交通，使中國軍火無法運輸；此外，日本以爲深入了廣西，即可以威脅法屬越南邊境，從側面推進其政治上的目的。日人以爲法國人的恐懼心理，既大可利用，而英法勢如連雞，可望英法可以因此而共同壓迫中國。事實却又明白答復了日本，這種企圖是失敗了。但他的類似這樣的行動，並不因爲這樣一個失敗而就告終止，今後必尚有他種企圖。將隨軍事的攻勢而層出不窮。現在已見端倪的，是其謠言的攻勢。這種攻勢的目的，恐怕是如美人亞朋德所說：「現在日本勝利的希望，並不寄託在軍事行動上面，但寄託在她對中國民族性的估量上面、日本仍舊希望中國內部能引起政治糾紛，以代替目下團結一致的抗戰意志」。因爲她欲粉碎中國的抗戰意志，覓取政治上的收穫，所以放出種種謠言，說廣西將領如何如何，雲南將領如何如何，而他的軍事行動，也想配合了這種政治進攻，竭力想打通廣西，兵臨雲貴，可以達到不戰而勝的目的。可是這種企圖，徒見其心勞日拙。可信今日的中國，沒有一個將領，不是以團結禦侮爲其信條，也沒有一個將領，不以他們領袖的意志爲意志。中途退却，就是滅亡，這種觀念，深印中國一切戰士的腦中。中國今日唯一的不變方策，就是日本一天不放棄侵略，中國一天繼續抗戰，務予侵略者以打擊，獲得最後勝利。在華南方面加强防禦勢力，使日本一切政治軍事上的企圖，無法進展，這一目的，中國方面，已經達到，華日兩軍，已相持於邕賓間。華中的鄂中方面，華軍渡襄河，收復多寶灣羅漢寺仙桃鎭，切斷京鍾漢岳襄花各路，有下鍾祥搗隨縣之勢。鄂南則攻通城圍岳陽之勢。鄂東則進迫武穴蘄春。贛北則渡撫河而進向南昌。豫南則進向信陽。總之，中國在華中軍事上的着着進展，可以遙爲牽制，粉碎日軍集中全力進攻桂南的企圖，也可以積小勝爲大勝，要在促日軍在華侵略行動整個的崩潰。</p>

<p>（二）所謂訓政的具體工作、當然是實施地方自治、訓練人民行使四權、但是訓政的意義、却是要訓練人民使具備足以擔當國家政治的資格、而這種任務在中國經濟文化百事落後的情形下、尤其是承幾千年專制腐敗政治之後、是一件艱難巨大而不是旦夕所能完成的工作、我以爲意法儘管及早頒布、但大家決不能忽視總理設定訓政時期的一番苦心精意、一定要全國賢智之士、尤其是領導人民的分子、一致熱心積極、有公心誠意來共負訓政的重任、將來雖在憲法頒布以後、我們還是不能放棄訓政的工作、我認爲訓政之非一定要中國國民黨來擔當、而是熱心國事的人士共同應有的義務、我認爲訓政的意義不僅是政府訓練人民、還得要人民訓練自己、並且由各級民意機關來監督政府和訓練政府、各級民意機關設立以後、他的地位一方面是代表人民表達民意、一方面是監督政府、亦即是訓練政府、政府和民意機關並不是對立的、總理說「政治是管理衆人的」、在民意機關的分子、今天在議會明天可以在政府擔當工作、而且尤其在地方基層、每一個人民代表、同時在民意機關、同時要實際參加地方公共事業、所以互信互尊的態度、應當培養、休威共同的關係、應當認定、提携共進的習慣、應當養成、關於這一點、我們爲本會同人、應該率先爲全國國民的領導、我們要認定自身地位的重要、尊重自身的職權、我們在抗戰建國之中、一切的言論、不能違反我們所共矢遵從的三民主義、不能違背我們自身所議定的抗戰建國綱領、否則我們的一言一動、在國民面前、就沒有信用、沒有功效、再則、我們大家一定不願蹈過去議會的舊習、因之對於政府施政成續的批評、務必予以積極而善意的態度、要根據於法律和事實、不可根據謠言和惡意中傷的傳說、隨便提出譏彈、現在我們已決定要定期頒布憲法了、今天的參政會、就是爲將來憲治建立健全憲政的開始、不僅要本會作良好的模範、同時更要爲今天一般國民作模楷、我們要自覺、我們是負有師保人民和培育憲治的責任、</p>
<p>（三）憲政實施的功效、不在於憲法的條文和形式、而在於具備憲治的精紳、中國在三代時候、早已具有人民議政參政的憲治規模、民國以來、更有約法憲法的頒布、和參衆兩院的設置、祖是究竟這個憲法、這個參議會、於中國國家和人民實利、有多少貢獻呢、可以說、於國家人民、祗有害處、沒有益處、今天在座的同人中、　有參加過從前的國會的、也有為主義和憲法奮鬥而被捕入獄不惜犧牲一切的、各位對於旣往的議會歷史、一定有很多的感慨、爲什麽我們一樣的有憲法、有議會、而不能有益於國呢、爲什麼我們國事一步步的腐敗凌亂、到了今天、要受敵國如此的侵凌侮辱呢、在國民政府成立以後、我以中國國民黨的地位而言、我對於國事和外患、當然要自承應負的責任、在北洋政府時代、我也並不是說袁徐曹段政府沒有過錯、但我們當時的議會、實在不能不負很大的責任、我以爲民國以來、我們憲法和議會、都是沒有根基的、憲法是虛僞而不合國家的需要的、國會是不明瞭自身對於國家和人民應負的責任的、議員本身是不能尊重人民代表應有的職分和道德義務的、總理致力國民革命、手訂建國大網、所以要規定訓政、就因爲根據這種種事實敎訓、認爲要產生健全的憲政、造成眞正民有民治民享的國家、非經過訓政的階段不可、現在我們內審國勢、外察環境、旣要提早實施憲政、就必須從根本癥結所在、加以救治、我以爲過去我們議會、最大的毛病、就是忘却了我們中國立國的固有精神、我們的固有精神是什麽呢、就是（禮義廉恥）這四個字、拿現代語來解說、禮就是秩序、義就是責任、廉就是尊重他人、恥就是尊重自己、這可和我們古語所謂（居處恭執事敬與人忠）三句話的意義相通的、我們過去人民、因爲忽略了這個意義、不知道守法負責、尊重他人、尊重自己、那就無怪要憑藉地位、貽悞國事、結果、汚瀆了憲政的尊嚴、加深了人民的痛苦了、我們今天要認定、我們實施憲治、是要爲國家立百年久遠的規校、問題不在憲治是不是實行得太早、而在我們有沒有爲國家產生眞正憲政的誠意、如果大家都有這個誠意的話、我們儘不妨在訓政沒有完成前來頒行憲法、而同時仍可以貫澈訓政的精神、一方面訓練人民、提高他們對於國民責任和國家政治的認識、一方面訓練政府來提高各級政治的效率、我在上一次大會曾經對各位說、我們參政員、要以伊尹訓太甲周公訓成王的精神、來負起我們的責任、我們不但以這種精神訓導人民、也要以這種精神來軾助政府、所謂訓政的訓、本來並沒有居高臨下的意義的、訓政的訓字、也不是訓斥而是訓導、要像學校的導師、循循善誘、設身處地來訓誨學生、導之向上、並不像傲慢的主人、盛氣呵斥、來敎訓奴僕、使之難堪、所以不論是監督也好、批評也好、總是好意的輔導、而不是消極的責備、我們拿伊尹訓太甲、周公訓成王、諸葛武侯輔後主的先例來說、他們自身都先有一番公忠負責的精神、必莊必敬的態度、又如歷史忠臣、正色立朝、儘管是蹇蹇諤諤、不肯苟且迎合、但必正其衣冠、肅其儀容、端謹莊重、若臨大事、這就是現代所謂負責守紀的精神、也就是許多民治國家自尊人格和尊重他人人格的良好習慣、我們中國因爲政敎陵夷、這種民族固有精神、固然喪失殆盡、現代憲治的習慣、也一無成就、一般國民和靑年、習於輕浮、百事隨便、我不能希望個個國民、都能在一朝一夕之間、振衰起敝、但我實在懇切希望我們參政會同人、從這些意義上、躬行實踐、爲國民樹立良好的模範，也就是爲國家培養實行眞正憲政的基礎、最後更有一點、不憚反復爲我同人說的、我個人因爲切望我們革命建國事業的早日完成、切望我們國家早日實施憲政、具備現代國家的規模、確立生存發展長治久安的基礎、我常常深思熟考、我們國事所以凌亂不整永久不能上於軌道之故、我覺得我們中國歷史上政治敎化的演變、秦漢以前和秦漢以後眞是大大的不同、在周朝時候、我們有完美的議政制度、有完密的行政組織、和軍政組織、甚至實行井田制、民生主義、有具體而微的實現社會經濟、沒有壟斷壓迫不均不平的現象、一切政治社會、都是有條有理、爲什麼後來一天天的陵替敗壞、以至於今日、粉亂衰敝、國弱民困的現象、要遭遇如此嚴重的外患、我一再深思其故、認爲這不獨是秦漢以後失政失敎、少數君相豪紳、盜立威權、把人民權利、剝削殆盡之所致、而實在由於周代以前、我們是以禮治爲法治的綱維、以社會組織爲政治組織的基礎、那時節一切、都有組織、有訓練、無論學校軍隊社會家庭、最重要的是重禮義守秩序、所有的國民都不能規避責任和義務、不僅是法律的、而同時是道德的、唯其如此、所以周代政治能够這樣的昌明、我們以後要革命建國、必須把握這個要點、我們要知道無論憲法和其他法律訂得怎樣完備、如果沒有行法守法積極爲國家擔當責任的人民、這些根本大法、就成爲一紙空文、絲毫無補於國事、我們不怕抗戰不勝、建國不成、祇怕不能恢復我們民族重禮守法的固有精神、那纔是我們國家前途眞正的危險、各位同人、决不可以爲我這些話、爲空疏迂闊之談、實在這是我們民族興替存亡的關鍵所在、希望各位同人以身作則、領導國民、發揚我們固有的民族精神、這樣我們就必能獲得憲政的實效、就必能造成更鞏固的團結、更堅實的力量、就必能負起我們艱鉅的責任、達成我們神聖的使命、（二十五日電）</p>

<p>吾人踐臨斯土、所見所聞、厥爲與日俱增之繁榮、與蒸蒸日上之文化、大多數人民、咸能享受幸福、因此均有一種信念、認爲美國無論如何、不應捲入戰爭漩渦、縱須償付重大代價、亦所不惜、歐洲人對此、自無權加以非議、又况美國人民、雖具有此項信念、但同時對於世界上所發生之悲劇、並不因而漠不關心、或置之不議不論之列、反之其對於歐洲所發生之事件、匪特極爲關切、抑且深知此與美國利益有關、德國輒向英美兩國人民宣稱、凡爾賽和平條約、乃萬惡之淵藪、歐洲所由發生不幸事件、均係此項條約所致、此一觀念、信者頗多、匪特代表一種意見、亦幾乎成爲一種公認之事實、但究之實際、則一九一九年所成立之凡爾賽和約、以今視昔、雖不能認爲十全十美、但自另一方面言之、當時倘若簽訂更較惡劣之和約、亦復有其可能、良以彼時各國代表、雲槳巴黎、討論如何修正世界地圖、其所担任之工作、原非易事、况其所代表之國家、目睹大戰之結果、生靈塗炭、死亡枕籍、對於當時情境之凄凉、猶具有深刻之印象、加之痛定思痛、各該國咸皆相信、大戰之責任、應由德國負之、因此對於德國咸極憤懣、均欲加以報復、各國代表在此種環境之下、猶竭盡所能、依照民族自決之原則、擬成此項條約、巳屬未可厚非、且即以其最嚴厲之條款而論、以視德國與俄國羅馬尼亞國所訂和經中最溫和之條款、猶屬公允多多也、不寗唯是、凡爾賽和約雖被人視作禍息之根源、但二十年來、仍有若干事實、爲吾人所不能忘懷、蓋此約簽字之後、未及六載、即由羅迦諾公約取而代之、此一公約、係由關係各國完全同意而訂立、「當簽字之際、自由的德國之代表、亦在剴切表示、認爲此項公約、公平而光榮、自此而後、英法兩國與德國之關係、即不復依據凡爾賽和約、而改以羅迦諾公約爲基礎、職是之故、吾人倘認凡爾賽和約爲罪惡、實亦不免有過甚之處、</p>
<p>至於美國人民目下所注意之問題、厥爲現行戰爭結束之後、各項問題究當如何予以解決、因此凡自歐洲前來美國遊歷者、每與美國人相値、即以民治各國作戰目標所在爲問、此一問題、在歐洲人視之、不免引爲詫異、蓋凡人之正爲保全生命而戰者、多無暇計及作戰目標、以及戰勝之後、作何計較、是以歐戰爆發以還、歐洲人對於此一問題、並不十分注重、反之大西洋彼岸之旁觀者、則不能不認此爲首要問題、因此吾人亟應及時予以答覆、惟是、戰事結束之後、歐洲地圖、究當如何重新劃定、厥爲吾人作戰目標、端在建設新歐洲、務使各國今後咸能遵守信義、而使暴力與侵略、爲之絕跡、換言之、各國凡生存於此新歐洲者、不分戰敗國與戰勝國、均能和平相處、並共享繁榮而巳、</p>
<p>其次、美國人民對於前綫戰事膠着、英法德三國、均未大舉進攻一層、容或不無懷疑、此其心境、正如吾人前往劇塲觀一悲劇、在未開幕之前、因想像其情節、定必十分凄慘、以致神經緊張、屏息危坐、無如臺上遲不揭慕、因而觀衆咸問「何時開幕」此乃懷疑、而非失望、抑此種情緒、極爲自然、其所引起之疑團、亦非無法消釋、總之、此乃一時之現象、吾人敢斷言、此項問題、不久即可獲有答案、屆時甚或嫌其過於切實、過於慘酷、亦未可必也、（哈瓦斯）</p>

<p>日本國會和貴族院的一九三九到四〇年預算議會、二十三日起、在東京舉行、日本議會政治之魔鬼、暫時又釋出了、實際上議會最早將在下月開始、因爲向例休會過新歲假日後、議會才正式開幕、屆時、又將准許立憲日本之魔鬼在政治舞台前出沒無常、爲期三四個月、直到政府所要求的經費、經假定是代表日本民衆的人們核准而後已、日本的一九四〇到四一年預算、經最後一次票决、鬼影幢幢的表演、便吿結束、而日本的議會政治、又將酣然高臥過三季、日本的統治者、常施其計策、極獲成功、所以毫不疑惑的相信讓國會和貴族院議員得見光亮時、他們不致倔强反對、並將聽令而欣然返歸黑暗中去、</p>
<p>日本國會的兩院中、一度曾是眞正的預算戰的、在已往多年來、已祇是模擬戰了、尤其是從目前的中日戰爭爆發以來、東京已根本沒有眞正的預算辯論、近衛和平沼兩內閣、都已提出預算、而向日本國民作空前未有的銀錢上要求、但對這些預算、旣沒有加以令人滿意的解釋和辯明它的理由、也沒有遭到苛責、預算中的主項是軍人方面所要求的軍備和戰爭經費、它的數額、遠超日本眞正收入的總額、而本年度的軍備和戰爭經費、幾乎佔日本總支出的三分之一、所謂愛國的論辯、却作爲國會和貴族院議員不反對這些要求的託詞、並使陸海軍首腦得以傲慢地、甚至無禮地發出極含糊的解釋、它的特點、在於無與倫比的缺乏確鑿性、國會和貴族院眞加討論的、祇是預算中的微小項目、卽使是這些項目、也祇挑出其中不足重視的、加以較密切的考慮和稍發訾議、</p>
<p>照現象看米、一九三九到四〇年的預算議會、情况不致有根上的變動、日本困難的經濟狀况、和在華的延長戰事、結果已使日本民衆間發生若干不安、並使他們各統治者集團間的誤解日增、阿部政府特別荏弱、旣無資源、又乏創作能力、國會政客、大致將爲有益於他們的擁誕者起見、發動較平常更激烈的吵鬧、而表演政治戲劇、民政黨與政友會兩大政黨、將利用這時機、而使民衆憶及這兩黨並沒有完全隱去、且在實際上雖不維持參加日本政府的要求、但在原則上還是維持着這要求、然而、可不應誤認國會和貴族院將提出下列的根本預算問題中的任何一種、（一）供給在華戰事的經費和巨大的軍備補充，程序、（二）日本陸海軍任意處置四分之一的日本國家收入、（三）巨大的入不敷出、（四）無約束的借貸政策、（五）日本國家破產之處日增、</p>
<p>但這些根本問題、將在日本議會政治的幕後、導成劇戰、非但是國會議員和政府間、就是在政府中各個眞正重要份子之間、都將發生這種劇戰、藏相兼內閣企劃院總裁靑木、是阿部政府中最堅强的人物、在數週前、草擬預算案廢棄遵守已久的先例時、激戰便開始了、往年祇經常預算案才在預算會議前草擬、陸海軍慣在議會進行多時、方始提出特別經費數字、經常軍費中、或有被削除之數、陸海軍不得不容忍着、而在特別預算中得到恢復所削除數額的機會、但在本年、靑木却堅請陸海軍預先提出一切銀錢上的要求、靑木旣得陸海軍的預算、便勇敢地在這預算中削除日金二。〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元之巨、並在陸相海相驚愕未已時、勸使內閣核准這削除之數、而公布其經常與特別預算、軍部方面加以反對、陸海兩相、不得不强硬地要收回這失去的二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、日本預算議會幕後將爲這筆經費而互爭、五爭時的憤怒、將使阿部內閣倒台、並使日本統治力對於中國戰事的融洽、發生破裂、決不是不可能的、</p>
<p>靑木旣不是「大自由黨人」、也不是日本私人大資本主義的代表、却是一個半軍閥擴張主義者、和「大日本」的醉心者、在根本上贊同日本軍事而使他的地位、比較他優秀的前任者池田更安逸和堅强、但、靑木並沒忘却他的算術、且密切熟悉日本嚴重的經濟和財政狀况、而得到一個結論、這便是、日本已力不堪核准陸海軍所另提的巨大要求、否則將陷於財政禍難、靑木明瞭經過極大的困難才能至今應付陸海軍人所提的銀錢上要求、日本在這方面、巳盡了最大的能力、不能更勝於此了、東京軍部要開始實行巨大的程序、一方面在中國繼續照以前的範圍作戰、一方面使續編的陸軍師團全部機械化、靑木便試使陸軍明瞭爲了財政之故、這兩種「新年禮物」、不能同時兼得、而陸軍必須決定取那一種、實際上、靑木準備在一九四〇到四一年間給予日本軍人的經費、較一九三九到四〇年的本屆財政年度多三三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、他所草擬的預算案分配給日本陸軍和海軍的經費如次、</p>
<p>經常預算</p>
<p>陸軍……一·二九七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>海軍……一·〇一八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>特別預算</p>
<p>陸軍……二·九七三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>海軍……七三七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>準備金……七五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>共計……六·七五七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>日本一九四〇到四一年的經常和特別豫算總數達一〇·三六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、三六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇無、內中六〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元以上、將由東京政府交予日本各地方當局、所以眞正的政府豫算共約九·七〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、其中軍費約佔什六、其他若干種豫算項目、包括間接的軍費在內、例如公共福利豫算、幾乎完全用以照料在華戰傷的士兵和在華戰死士兵的家屬、豫算大藏省的經費增加四〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、多半是因爲以前彌補在華軍費而發行的公債債息、已經增加所致、綜計陸海軍的經費、和陸海軍在華冒險所需經費、達一九四〇到四一年豫算總額的什七以上、靑木若核准陸海軍所要求另加的二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、那末、日本豫算總額、當已增到一一·七〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、其中幾有百分之七十五將撥給陸海軍、這是日本財政力所完全不能勝任的、</p>
<p>現以一九四〇到四一年日本的收入預算和上述的支出數相比較、佔計從業已存在的來源所得的普通收入、祇三·四一八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、日本將下令普遍的增稅、美其名曰改革捐稅、預料增稅後、又可收人七三一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、那末、佔計收入總額、是四·一四九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、這數字較本年度約高一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、稅捐續增百分之三十五左右、但較草擬的經費總額、還短少五·五〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、東京政府擬在一九四〇年四月一日起下屆財政年度中發行的新內債、也在五·五〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元左右、本屆財政年度發行的公債、擬定是五·九〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、從這種情形看來、日本似乎正開始稍减公債的發行額、這種印象却是謬誤的、因爲東京政府正在拖延着尙未運用的巨額公債發行權、擬在一九四〇到四一年引用這發行權、屆時實際上發行的公債、將遠較以前任何年度爲巨、</p>
<p>自此次中國戰爭爆發以來、日本已發行價値一〇·六六二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元的內債、因此在一九三七年六月底是一〇·五八〇·三〇一·〇〇〇元的國債到上月底已增加到二〇·八五九·三八二·〇〇〇元、再加本屆財政年度所剩日期內將發行的公債以及擬在一九四〇到四一年發行的五·五〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、將使國債增到二八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元以上、祇是這笨債務的利息和零償本金便須二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元以上、實佔日本估計在下屆財政年度內正規收入總額的半數、從這數字看來、對於日藏相感覺在其新預算中不能更添經費數額、便不足奇了、這些預算、在日本目前的國家收入中所佔不下三分之一、巳往幾個月來、日本的公債吸收力已减低、而通貨膨脹却不斷增高、日本銀行的紙幣發行額正在一再創最高紀錄、</p>
<p>日本的財政、已開始成無可挽回的情勢、縱然靑木强硬得足使軍人另外要求二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、歸於失敗、然而最後的災難和崩潰、已露微象了、</p>

<p>— 禾</p>
<p>兩租界有一萬數千輛　五萬多人靠着它過活</p>
<p>上海的交通工具，公用的有汽車，電車和人力車。後者—人力車雖是落後的交通工具；可是在上海仍不失為一般人民的代步利器。</p>
<p>戰後，上海被認為避難的樂土，人口激劇地增加，公共租界的人力車並未减少，依然保存將近一萬輛的數目。法租界現祇有三四千輛，戰前連華界在內約有一萬輛，此種人力車，俗名小照會，祇得在法租界內通行；至於公共租界的人力車，俗稱大照會，兩租界均得通行。現在兩租界人力車總數，共計約一萬三四千。每一輛人力車由四人輪流拖拉，那末，人力車夫就要有五萬五六千人。與各行的人數比較起來，人力車夫倒佔了很大的數字。</p>
<p>人力車夫的生活，好說在勞力中最吃苦的了。在酷暑烈日之下，他們照常要不顧死活的奔跑；在風雨雪落的冬天，為着生活的驅使，不得不去幹牛馬似的生活。這幾天，氣候嚴寒，尤其在深夜，寒氣凜冽，在死去似的馬路上，黯淡的燈光下，沒有主顧的人力車夫無聊的躑躅着。這景象是够凄凉的！</p>
<p>人力車夫拉車是有規定的，平均每四人拉一輛，晝夜無間。（戰後，因宵禁關係，略限制。）每日夜分兩班，每班十二小時：目上午四時至下午四時為一班，下午四時至翌晨四時為一班，每天租金每輛七角七分。戰後，因為人口特增，他們的生意是比戰前好，一天奔跑的代價大約二元光景。這樣的收入似乎還算不差，其實除掉車租，所剩元餘，維持個人，差堪溫飽，如有家室，那就困難了。但車夫家屬在滬者，在人力車夫總數中佔百分之九十五弱。在車夫家屬中問，妻妹子女或可找些工作做做，藉資彌補一下，主要的還是要靠拉車所得的代價過活。目前物價昂貴，他們的生活，更顯得艱難了。</p>
<p>他們的生活很是簡單，光身漢寄居承放人處，戰前不收房租，戰後酌收少數房租，拉車一班，收三四分不等。車夫有家室者，他們大都於滬西越界自搭草棚，有一人獨搭的，也有數人合搭的。所以滬西的棚戶區域，便成了人力車夫的集中地。</p>
<p>關於人力車夫生活上有很多帮助的，在公共租界，有一個人力車夫互助會的組織。</p>
<p>上海人力車夫互助會戰後的會所，設於愛多亞路大世界對面，此外，再設東南西三個分會。凡是領有上海公共租界工部局公用人力車拉車執照的都可為會員。會員並不要交費用，該會的經費來源，主要的是工部局微收的車照費，以每人力車一元五角，捐助該會，每月約一萬四千餘元。該會的主要事工分：事務，醫務，智育，互濟，保險，糾紛調解，生活改進事業。它過去會舉行幾個運動，如健康運動，防疫運動，安全運動，成人教育運動等。</p>
<p>該會對於人力車夫的生活調查，有幾點是很有意義的。例如：關於知識，統計五千餘人中有三千五百七十八人不識字，佔百分之七十一弱。關於嗜好，最普遍之嗜好是烟酒和賭博三項，尚有少數車夫吸雅片及白麵，將一日血汗所得，盡耗於此。至於車夫籍貫，拉車人以鹽城，阜寗，通州，泰縣約佔全人力車夫的三分之二，其中以鹽城，阜寗兩帮為首。</p>
<p>總之，該會的宗旨在謀人力車夫的幸福，和改良其生活狀况；並予人力車夫各種利益與便利。所以該會自設醫院，為疾病的車夫解除痛苦。除了辦成人教育班外，還舉辨子弟學校。更設有閱報室，所備的報紙有申，新，中美及各種畫報。據說人力車夫於辛勞之餘，去閱報消遣的很多。這未始不是該會設立成人教育班，灌輸知識的功效。</p>
<p>最後還值得一提的，據該會報告，本年度曾辦理互濟案件三千九百九十件，其中以米案為最多，其次為喪葬事件。目前物價騰貴，佔有極大數字的人力車夫，他們的生活勢必感受威脅。此時正希望該會本以往精神，為這般車夫謀福利。如事實容許，不妨購買洋米，舉辦平糶，這不僅裨益人力車夫本身，對社會也是極有利的。</p>

<h3 id="c63">本屆大學　統一招生考試概况　（十四） <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>（三）制度本身的問題　有一部分人認爲統一招生這個制度、在現在沒有實行的必要、他的立塲認爲招生是學校行政的一種、應由各校自行舉辦、用不着政府來統籌辦理、尤其是大學院系繁複、各院各系目有其特點、自行招生、可以保持他的特點、如實行統一招生、採用統一標準、不足以適應各校的特性、這種說法、未嘗沒有理由、但是我們仔細的加以研究、却不盡然、蓋各校自行招生、寬嚴極不一致、有的錄取標準高、有的錄取標準低、各自爲政、有的特別注重基本科目、有的却又注重其他不必要科目、致學生往返投考、須做多種不適應科目的準備、以試題而論、有多數學校命題、超出高中課程標準以上、甚至用英文試題、限制用英文作答、或以習慣關係、不准以文言或白話作答、試題的難易、相差尤爲懸殊、諸如此類情形、不能謂爲適當、再以學生方面來說往返奔波、報考數校、會考之後、繼之以各校考試、其精神之痛苦、可以想見、昔日邊遠省區學生、如欲投考其心目中所願入之學校、常以路途遙遠或經濟困難、不敢一試、學生報考數校、考生相同、科目相似、時間相近、惟學校不同、地點不同、試題不同、錄取標準不同、費時·費事·費金錢·費精神、在此抗戰期間、交通極度困難、這種招生的辦法、確實有待於改進、因此、統考的試行、和統考的制度的建立、實有其必要、可是統考的目的、並非全在於此、還是樹立一致的標準、遂漸提高學生的程度、統一招生、決不是降低標準、多取學生、而是在根據實際需要、以求大學敎育合理的調整、</p>
<p>（十一）個人的意見</p>
<p>以上各節、已將統考意義、辦理情形、及一般的批評、大概的叙述過了、歸納來說、統考制度的本身、可以說有存在而且繼續施行的價値、可是方法方面、因爲實施還只有兩年的歷史、確實有許多地方還有改進的必要、我可以說統考與會考是同等的重要、會考的方法可以改善、而會考的制度是不容反對的、統考也是一樣、有許多人常以方法辦理不善、而懷疑甚至反對制度的本身、因噎廢食、這是不合理的一件事情、但是方法上究有多少要改進呢、這是値得我們研究的、現在把個人的意見寫在下面、以供敎育界人士的商榷和參考、</p>
<p>（一）錄取標準的商榷　統考現在所採用的標準、是一個標準、換一句話說、就是統一的標準、無論投考任何一組、或任何一系、只要成績在這個統一標準以上、即可錄取、他的好處、就是在於統一、標準統一、學生的程度可獲得比較的整齊、但從另一方面來看、大學各院各系、學科不同、性質尤異、以理學院來說、物理系要招收的學生、與化學系小盡同、與地理、地質生物、心理系更不同、文學院的中國文學系、與歷史、社會系不盡同、與外國文學系更不同、院與院之間、性質尤有差別、嚴格的說、最好各院有各院不同的考試科目、甚至有各茶不同的考試科目、同一學院或性質相同的學院、考試科目即或相同、而錄取標準却不能完全一致、最理想的標準、是每系有一特定的標準、至少亦應每院有一特定的標準、現在統考所採取的辦法、是分組的辦法、考試科目、公民·國文·外國文·本國史地四科、是三組共同考試科目、數學亦三組所必試、但學科的內容、與題目的難易是不同的、第二組程度最高、第三組次之、第四組又次之、此外第一組必試外國史地、第二組必試物理化學、第三組必試生物、或外國史地、物理或化學、但是第一組、所包括的院系甚多、如第一組包括文法商學院各系、師範學院敎育等系及工學院的鐵道管理系、第二組包括工學院各學系、理學院數學等學系、及師範學院理化等學系、第三組包括醫學院、農學院各學系、理學院生物等學系、及師範學院博物系、考試科巨各組雖有不同、而錄取標準則三組一致、自不能適於各院各系的特殊性質、如採用分系或分院標準、事實上學系太多、而考試科目並未分院或分系訂定、自無必要、且每一考生有三個不同志願的院系、分院分系標準亦無從適用、最好的方法還是採分組標準的辦法、因爲同組的考試科目是相同的、且不受考生不同志願院系的牽制、所謂分組錄取標準各組標準的高低當然是不同的、如某組考生多、超過各校容量總額、可酌量提高錄取標準、反之如某組考生少或一般成績不甚高、即可將錄取標準稍稍降低、如此非僅供求相適應、减少分發的困難、而且可以調劑各科人數的懸殊、各組學科不同、性質不同、人數的供求亦不同、分組錄取標準、仍可保持同組的標準、故仍不失其統一本旨、</p>
<p>（二）各科人數的調劑　我們在前面已看出統考各科人數懸殊的現象、無論考生的考試志願、或錄取的人數、均是集中於少數的院系、理科是各種科學的基礎、而錄取名額特少、中國以農立國、戰時農業生產、何等重要、而錄取的農科新生、僅二百餘人、戰時及平時的醫藥衛生人才如何迫切需要、而取錄的醫科新生亦僅二百餘人、文法科關係國家文化前途、但以志願者少、錄取因亦不多、錄取旣少、分配結果、有一系僅一二人、甚至一人而無之、統考為尊重考生志願起見、又不便以志願學工科者、强以習農醫、且以組別不同、考試科目不同、根本亦無從强迫、因此人數過少的院系、只好聽其自然、除准其補招外、實無他法、但此項辦法、殊失統一招生的精神、補救的方法、唯有從調劑各科人數着手、前節所述的分組錄取標準、即爲調劑方法一種、統考的目的、在統籌全局、對於院系的設置、班級的增减、學額的多寡人數的分配、應參酌國家需要、事先爲有計劃的統籌、如某科人數應該增加、或於幾年內應造成某科人才若干、不妨由政府設置某科國家獎學金名額、鼓勵學生應考、例如今年理農醫科學生特少、明年即可增設此類學科的獎學金名額多名、獎勵學生踴躍報名、國家獎學金、應較一般獎學金優厚、名額應多、一方面可以吸收優秀學生、一方面可以根據需要調劑各科人數、否則大學各科人數衆寡懸殊、開系設班旣不經濟、且人才養成、缺乏計劃、亦非國家前途之福、所以我們爲統考制度的本身計、爲敎育政策的合理計、這個計劃、確有實施的必要、</p>

<h3 id="c81">隔膜解 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>記得有位學者曾當衆說過，人與人之間永遠是隔膜的。他這樣說似乎很希望大家同情這個隔膜。但人家似乎也聽得厭了，缺乏了同情的興趣。這倒並非足以恰巧證明他底見解不錯，那是他和前人洋洋灑灑的大文章倒有共通的地方——原來是述而不作而已。</p>
<p>話呢，自然也是有根據的，譬如人與人之間不連生在一起，不關痛癢，爾爲爾，我爲我，哈哈和唉唉同時發生之類。然而僅持有生理的簡單的理由很難折服，吾則珊瑚之外，狼與狽也初無二致，彷彿不祇人類如此。</p>
<p>隔瞙並非不存在，起先就不如此，後來倒爲了「生活」。學者感到孤獨的苦悶也是有的，發爲議論雖與先哲有略同之處，而人家之不歡迎却大半也是「生活」的距離。</p>
<p>以隔膜要由生活來解除。</p>
<p>從前，曾有一個被判死刑的革命家，當行刑時來了許多觀衆；觀衆呢，一部份轟的騷動一陣，中間夾雜些感嘆和笑。革命家是富於情感的，不免發些牢騷，占詩一首：「急雨大江東，狂風入大海；生死總爲君，可憐君不解！」這很沈痛。然而觀衆的笑也有分別，也不容一槪抹煞。——倒不一定能爲研究戀愛史的專家所能了解的。革命家底詩不過作爲一種情感的解嘲，吾則隔膜而至於此，也不會給予某種可怕的印象，而有砍頭的危險了。</p>
<p>這也讓生活來說明。</p>
<p>就近言之，這些時候和地方來很熱鬧的慶祝耶誕，這是爲了耶穌人格的偉大，「犧牲自己，博愛打羣」——彼此一點也不隔膜。有些表示十分融合起見，會通宵在歡，不過却有十五元一客大餐以示限制，就見得不大「博愛」了。自然，在街頭的不易「親近」，這也由來已久，祇在八一三後更形顯著而巳。這「永遠」還延續若干時日，我可不知道。</p>
<p>熱心之士抱着不平起來。提議準備把火鷄給到街頭去吃，「與民同樂」，可是大概這慷慨都想發表於筵席之間。等一會「焗猪柳元汁燒茨仔」與「白帽蛋糕」塞在嘴裏，便也不免靜默三分鐘了。</p>
<p>回到外邊嘔出鷄骨頭，讓可憐的孩子們來同聲感謝；而一方面念念有辭的駡「猶大」太無心肝；使自己也相信，鷄肉眞給「猶大吃了似的。</p>
<p>這是「慈善」丯度。</p>
<p>隔膜嗎，也讓它「永遠」下去。</p>
<p>你要譏笑我抱着改良主義者底態度來仗義執言嗎？我也不敢。要在樽俎之間折衝着作平行談判，說些「耶穌自有道理」的應景話，以挽救屠夫沒落的運命，這倒也是頗可注意的。雖然有其隔膜之原因，却也不無其親近之手段而改良之。</p>
<p>聰明的「猶大」，你自管自的吃你底「絨湯」去吧，說等待三千年才能解除人與人之間的隔膜也成，但先得準備更多量的血與火藥；擲送火鷄腿和媚眼還是白費心思的。亞們！</p>

<p>從松林裏溜上一輪紅日，一夜的霧霧便無踪地消散了。風掠向河面和沙原，靜靜趟着的大地在陽光下甦醒過來。</p>

<p>今天，隊長格外的露出他的黑眼睛，嚥了一口饅頭：</p>
<p>「歸隊，六點十分鐘出發桑浦山！』</p>
<p>忽然，隊伍在集合的號聲下騷動了。</p>
<p>「立正——」</p>
<p>口令像雷響似地，隊伍猛的變成靜寂。隊長莊嚴地看着每個人的服裝！</p>
<p>「那個說話的，就算烏龜吧！』</p>
<p>一陣笑聲雜在行進的步伐中。</p>
<p>白日下的一條鐵流呵……</p>
<p>一片沙原展開面前，不遠就有山的斜坡，嶙峋的石塊矗立着，成排的松樹圍繞在山腰，白雲遮蓋了山峯，……塵石下響着山泉，幾隻蒼鷹迂廻在密林間。</p>
<p>無盡長的山脈綿延了　原，那條長跎似的榕江便跟着山的盡頭而連亙了一綫的東海。一</p>
<p>「那不是榕江在流麼？』</p>
<p>拐上一層山道，我們跳出了松林，朝東瞻望，大家更披上了意外的喜悅：</p>
<p>「那條水從西北方流來，它會帶給我們可愛的奇績，有人說唐朝的韓愈曾在這裏渡江上京的……』</p>
<p>「嗯！嶺東千百萬居民的田地也全靠它灌溉呢！」</p>
<p>十四歲的小同志冒着一面沙灰，說話時候很用勁，有時連口裏的涎水都濺前頭人的身上。</p>
<p>許多人在「懷古」了，有人唸起韓愈在潮州做官時的一首詩，再有人高整的唱着一支保衛家鄕的民歌。</p>
<p>「欲達目的地，更跨一座山吧！」</p>
<p>一隊人笑着，隊長也笑得眼睛瞇瞇地……</p>
<p>山下，隱伏着靑綠的田野，點點的村堡，交錯着斷續的炊烟，祖國的河山啊。</p>
<p>這裏，忽爾榕江不見了，我們依舊照着隊長指定的方向走。</p>
<p>轟！</p>
<p>似乎飛來一聲砲響，隊長命令我們停止行進。</p>
<p>不管什慶砲聲，我們得趕快到達城裏，要是狄人進襲，隊部當然是接着情報的，明天大家就能動員了……現在，跑步——』</p>
<p>鐵流又迅速動着。</p>
<p>集中共同的目標，草鞋捲起沙土，前後却是迷濛莫辨，年輕的同志一足滑下去一滾身就翻轉來，路旁枯葉跟起風勢也似在背後飄舞着，鷙鷹飛出樹梢，　蕩聲聲怪呌。</p>
<p>「快到了！」</p>
<p>太陽照在正空，幾十個臉孔交流着血與火……</p>

<p>— 徐翊</p>
<p>寒暑表上的水銀柱跌下了不少，咳嗽也跟着增多起來，外面風刮得緊，雖然還有很好的陽光，但它却從來沒有光臨到室裏過。</p>
<p>冰冷的房子，古奮的時鐘響着冰冷的歎息；我看見一隻餓虎侵入我的心窩，咬着我，咬着我的心，隨着我想起了許多的事情。</p>
<p>對着古鐘，我酸苦地笑了。</p>
<p>時鐘，從祖父的手裏傳遞到父親的手裏，從父親的手裏又傳遞到了我手裏，而今已是顯示着那麼衰老與孤單了。</p>
<p>整天整夜地它訴說着它的一生歷史，過後，它又抱怨似地呶着嘴說：「現在，看你這個沒出息的樣子，看你道個沒出息的樣子！」</p>
<p>當它每决唱着粗俗遲緩而又沙啞的歌時，我老是狼狠地訂它一眼，我覺得它是在蠶食着我的生命，催促我跟死亡漸漸地接近。</p>
<p>我想起去年的一夜，我怎樣艱苦地携着它跟我逃出來……</p>
<p>我又想起十年前，父親用着遲鈍的手和眼，指着古鐘，瞧着他的孩子……</p>
<p>侷促地，我繞着室中踱走，當我面對着時鐘的時候，我驚嚇得幾乎呌起來：我看見父親的臉，祖父的臉，那麼地嚴酷，那麼地憤怒！</p>
<p>於是，時鐘訴說着它的怨曲，它斥賣我不應該留在這裏，它說它不應該被放在這卑汚的破桌上，最後，它咆哮起來：「你不是你父親的兒子，你不是你祖父的孫子！」</p>
<p>我用咳嗽掩蓋住了它的咒駡，我撇開頭向外面，向窗外；我看見陽光，從未照到我室中來過的陽光！</p>
<p>「做一隻候鳥罷」，我伸舒一下身子，整理起簡單的行裝，携起這隻祖傳下來的時鐘。</p>
<p>眞的，就在明天，我耐不住寒冷而又要搬家了。</p>

<p>至於傀儡戲的方式，在這張畫報上，說得也很淸楚！『傀儡戲仿自陳平，後人師其意，作種種戲劇，頗堪悅目！其大者用綫牽動，名曰提戲。今滬上所演者，木人長的七八寸，或套於手指，或運以木機，總名之曰木頭人戲。』</p>
<p>他所謂『仿自陳平」，係根據於樂府雜錄：「漢高祖」在平城爲冒頓」所圍，其城一面即「冒頓」妻「閼氏」，兵强於三面，壘中絕食，「陳平一訪知」閩氏」妬忌，即造木偶人運機關舞於陣間，「蘭氏」慮下其城，「冒頓」必納妓女，遂退軍，後樂家翻爲戲具，即傀儡也。」果如此節所云，那末傀儡戲的產生，係在絕食的圍城之中，確是不祥之物！而且上愧儡當的，又是那性情妬忌的「閼氏」夫人，無怪婦人孺子之喜看傀儡戲也。</p>
<p>蘇聯之兒童劇塲，每一城市及工廠區域，都有設立。較大城市，多至五六所。所演的戲，方式種類很多。有話劇，有歌劇，有舞蹈，大部是由兒童充當演員。我們所參觀的，是「列寗格勒」的一所專演傀儡戲的兒童劇塲。他的演法，與我國的提綫戲相同。不過「麻雀雖小，五臟俱全」。關於劇本，布景，燈光，音樂，以及木偶的動作，裝束……等等舞台上必要的條件，都有精密的研究，一絲不苟，不以其細小而忽之，誠足令人師法。</p>
<p>那天所演的戲，名曰「嬾人國」。顧名思義；便可知是一齣敎人「仇懶前勤」的劇劇。故事很簡潔，描寫一個「不勞動者」的躭逸偷安，造成許多罪惡反自斃英身。另一個勞動者，如何艱苦努力，辛勤奮鬬，而得到最後光榮的成功。劇中人的年齡與環境，什九以兒童的生活爲藍本，更在戲的結構之中，加以灌輸常識的穿揷，如週遊世界的一幕，印度人的弄蛇，西班牙的鬬牛，在在使兒童於發生興趣之中，受到很多的普通常識。在那一幕裏面，對於我國的描寫，倒還算十分客氣，僅有一玩童，於流浪的生活之中，做出許多出軌的笑話而已！</p>

<p>佛葛克勞埃是「叛艦諜血記」的導演，但是他處理「長風破浪」的手腕顯然是不及前者的。第一，他把大衛和的翰的奮鬬，都是平面的瑣碎的寫述，而沒有抓住一點頂點來强調它，以致引擎船初次啟航時的喜悅，不能達到分外熱鬧和愉快的境地。第二，新船遇險時，在萬分危急之際，他才加强大衛和曼麗的羅曼史，這種好整以暇的處理手法，就破壞了這最後的裔潮；而况畫面的織接不够明快簡潔，如老人的受傷，和旅客的惶恐，都不是很快的掠過，而大衛的冒死修理，又沒有着力的描寫，這樣，在船後航行，大衛放下了石塊似的坐下來的一個鏡頭，一點也顯不出力量。</p>

<p>Shaanzhou: The remaining Japanese troops near Changzi have been subjected to mopping-up operations by the Chinese army since the 21st, resulting in many being annihilated. On the evenings in question, the Japanese set fire to the area around the city on all four sides, illuminating the night to prevent the Chinese from entering the city. A unit of the Chinese army advanced to the vicinity of Yinqiu (east of Changzi), destroying many sections of the highway. Moreover, more than 1,000 Japanese troops from Changzhi launched an attack to the west, but were defeated by the Chinese army. The Chinese took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Beiliu Village, capturing a large number of supplies. Another unit attacked Dongxi Ligao (southeast of Tunliu).

On the night of the 21st, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched another general offensive, with one force directly approaching the West Gate, engaging in a fierce battle that lasted a day and a night. The Japanese, due to excessive deaths, showed signs of collapse. At the same time, another unit advanced to Songcun, Changzi, repeatedly destroying sections of the highway, and ambushing Japanese troops northwest of Changzhi in Dongxi Wangcun. A certain unit of the Chinese army further pursued and besieged Changzhi. The Japanese stubbornly resisted, unleashing fierce artillery fire. The Chinese soldiers fought more bravely, finally breaking into the North Gate by morning, leading to street fighting, and fiercely attacking the Japanese artillery positions in Beiliu Zhuang, capturing many supplies. To contain Japanese reinforcements, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Changcun Town (northeast of Tunliu), and another besieged Raodian Town, with fighting continuing into the evening.

Currently, there are over 2,000 Japanese troops in the suburbs of Xia County and in the areas of Xiaolü Village, Zhangguo Store, Wangyukou, and Duncun. They are very afraid due to continuous attacks by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 21st, they fired dozens of rounds of poison gas shells in a desperate attempt to put up a last stand. In Dian'eryuan, east of Yicheng, there were over a hundred Japanese troops. On the evening of the 20th, brave Chinese troops stormed into the village.

<h3 id="e8">Clear Military Dynamics <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The recent Chinese military offensive in central China has various implications. One of its purposes is to contain the Japanese army, preventing it from transferring more troops to fight in southern Guangxi, and then trapping the Japanese army in isolated Nanning, leading to its destruction. Therefore, from a military perspective, the "winter offensive" touted by the Japanese is not a full-scale counteroffensive. However, the activity of Chinese troops in various regions has dealt a major blow to the Japanese, and it does have important value in the overall war situation. The fact that the Japanese army has been unable to advance for a year after occupying Wuhan has doomed it to failure. As General Chen Cheng explained in the context of Chinese history of war, "It is easy to go from north to south, but it is usually extremely difficult to go from east to west, so the Shanghai war determined the first step in the failure of the Japanese". Although Japan used great effort to gain Wuhan, it has always failed to control the "upper reaches" of Jingxiang and the "right arm" of Xiangyang. The May attack on northern Hubei resulted in a crushing defeat in northern Hubei, and the October attack on Changsha resulted in a crushing defeat in northern Hunan. Having learned these two lessons, it adopted a defensive posture in central China and attempted to develop toward Guangdong and Guangxi. From scattered news from various sources, we can conclude that Japan's invasion of Guangxi is being carried out with all its strength. Therefore, the center of gravity of the overall war has also shifted to the south. In other words, the focus of future wars will be in southern China, not central China. After Japan captured Nanning, the military spokesperson in Tokyo stated that Japan's military operations in southern China would not end with Nanning, "Because the Japanese army is determined to eliminate the southwest's blood supply artery", that is, to cut off the Dian-Vietnam Railway and the Dian-Burma Highway, to stop China's international transportation, and to prevent the transportation of Chinese military supplies. In addition, Japan believes that by penetrating into Guangxi, it can threaten the border of French Vietnam and advance its political goals from the side. The Japanese believed that the French's fear could be used to great advantage, and that Britain and France were like chickens tied together, hoping that Britain and France could jointly pressure China as a result. However, the facts clearly answered Japan, and this attempt failed. However, his actions like this will not end with such a failure, and there will inevitably be other attempts in the future, which will emerge endlessly with military offensives. What is already visible is his rumor offensive. The purpose of this offensive, I am afraid, is as the American Apender said: "Now Japan's hope of victory is not pinned on military action, but on her estimate of Chinese national character, Japan still hopes that internal political disputes can be caused in China to replace the current united will of resistance". Because she wants to shatter China's will to resist and seek political gains, she releases all kinds of rumors, saying how the generals of Guangxi are doing, how the generals of Yunnan are doing, and his military actions also want to cooperate with this political offensive, trying to open up Guangxi and approach Yunnan and Guizhou, so as to achieve the goal of winning without war. But this attempt only sees her heart is exhausted and her skills are poor. It is credible that today's China, there is no general who does not take unity against insults as his creed, and there is no general who does not take the will of their leader as his will. Retreating halfway is destruction, this concept is deeply imprinted in the minds of all Chinese soldiers. China's only unchanging policy today is that China will continue to resist as long as Japan does not give up its aggression, and it is necessary to strike the aggressors and achieve final victory. Strengthening defensive forces in southern China, so that Japan's political and military attempts cannot progress, this goal, China has already achieved, Chinese and Japanese troops are holding each other between Yong and Bin. In the central Hubei area of central China, the Chinese army crossed the Xiang River, recovered Duobao Bay, Luohan Temple, and Xiantao Town, cutting off the Jingzhong, Han-Yue, Xiang-Hua roads, and has the potential to attack Zhongxiang and raid Suixian. In southern Hubei, there is a situation of attacking Tongcheng and encircling Yueyang. In eastern Hubei, it is approaching Wuxue and Qichun. In northern Jiangxi, it crossed the Fu River and advanced towards Nanchang. In southern Henan, it is advancing towards Xinyang. In short, China's military progress in central China can remotely contain and shatter the Japanese army's attempt to concentrate its efforts to attack southern Guangxi, and can also accumulate small victories into big victories, so as to promote the overall collapse of the Japanese army's aggressive actions in China.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Explanation by Speaker Jiang of the National Political Council on the Understanding Necessary for Implementing Constitutional Government <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Not only do they not hinder each other, but they are mutually dependent. I believe that political tutelage should be actively carried out not only during the period of political tutelage, but constitutional government does not necessarily have to begin on the day the political tutelage completely ends. This is something everyone can understand from the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. In other words, implementing constitutional government as soon as possible is precisely the purpose of our revolution and does not violate the policies of our party. At the same time, only by truly striving for the work of training the people can we firmly lay the foundation for our constitutional rule. Therefore, on the one hand, we demand the implementation of constitutional government, and on the other hand, after the promulgation of the constitution, we must continue the unfinished work of political tutelage.</p>
<p>(Two) The specific work of so-called political tutelage is, of course, to implement local self-government and train the people to exercise the four powers. However, the meaning of political tutelage is to train the people to have the qualifications to shoulder national politics. This task, especially after thousands of years of autocratic and corrupt politics, is a difficult and huge task that cannot be completed overnight given China's backwardness in economy and culture. I believe that even if the constitution is promulgated as early as possible, everyone must not ignore the painstaking efforts of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in setting the period of political tutelage. All the wise and talented people in the country, especially those who lead the people, must be enthusiastic and active, and bear the heavy responsibility of political tutelage with public spirit and sincerity. Even after the promulgation of the constitution in the future, we still cannot abandon the work of political tutelage. I believe that political tutelage is not necessarily the responsibility of the Kuomintang alone, but a common obligation of those who are enthusiastic about national affairs. I believe that the meaning of political tutelage is not only that the government trains the people, but also that the people train themselves, and that people's opinions institutions at all levels supervise the government and train the government. After the establishment of people's opinions institutions at all levels, their position is, on the one hand, to represent the people and express public opinion, and on the other hand, to supervise the government, that is, to train the government. The government and people's opinions institutions are not opposed to each other. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Politics is the management of the public." Those in people's opinions institutions can work in the government tomorrow, and especially at the local level, every people's representative must participate in local public undertakings at the same time in people's opinions institutions. Therefore, an attitude of mutual trust and mutual respect should be cultivated, a relationship of shared honor and shared disgrace should be recognized, and a habit of helping each other should be cultivated. Regarding this point, we, as members of this council, should take the lead in leading the people of the country. We must recognize the importance of our own position and respect our own powers. In the midst of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, none of our words can violate the Three Principles of the People that we have all sworn to follow, nor can they violate the outline for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction that we have all agreed upon. Otherwise, our every word and action will have no credibility or effect in front of the people. Furthermore, we must all not want to repeat the old habits of past parliaments. Therefore, in criticizing the government's performance in governance, we must adopt a positive and well-intentioned attitude, and base it on law and facts, not on rumors and malicious slanderous stories, and casually make accusations. Now we have decided to promulgate the constitution on a regular basis. Today's National Political Council is the beginning of establishing a sound constitutional government for the future. Not only should this council serve as a good model, but it should also serve as a model for the general public today. We must be aware that we have the responsibility of mentoring and protecting the people and cultivating constitutional rule.</p>
<p>(Three) The effectiveness of the implementation of constitutional government does not lie in the articles and forms of the constitution, but in possessing the spirit of constitutional rule. China already had a constitutional scale of people discussing and participating in politics in the Three Dynasties. Since the Republic of China, there have been even more promulgations of provisional laws and constitutions, and the establishment of the Senate and the House of Representatives. But how much contribution has this constitution and this parliament ultimately made to the practical interests of the Chinese nation and people? It can be said that it has only been harmful and not beneficial to the nation and the people. Among the colleagues present today, some have participated in the former parliament, and some have been arrested and imprisoned and sacrificed everything for the sake of doctrine and the constitution. Everyone must have many feelings about the past history of parliament. Why do we have the same constitution and the same parliament, but we cannot benefit the country? Why has our national affairs become increasingly corrupt and chaotic, and today we have to suffer such invasion and humiliation from enemy countries? After the establishment of the National Government, I, from the position of the Kuomintang, must, of course, admit the responsibility I should bear for national affairs and foreign troubles. During the Beiyang government era, I am not saying that the Yuan, Xu, Cao, and Duan governments had no faults, but our parliament at that time really cannot but bear a great responsibility. I believe that since the Republic of China, our constitution and parliament have had no foundation. The constitution is hypocritical and does not meet the needs of the country, the parliament does not understand its own responsibilities to the country and the people, and the parliamentarians themselves cannot respect the duties and moral obligations that people's representatives should have. Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted himself to the national revolution and personally drafted the Outline of National Reconstruction, so he stipulated political tutelage, precisely because based on these facts and lessons, he believed that in order to produce a sound constitutional government and create a truly people-owned, people-governed, and people-enjoyed country, it is necessary to go through the stage of political tutelage. Now we examine the national situation internally and observe the environment externally. Since we want to implement constitutional government early, we must treat the root cause. I believe that the biggest problem with our parliament in the past was that we forgot the inherent spirit of our Chinese nation. What is our inherent spirit? It is the four words (propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame). In modern terms, propriety is order, righteousness is responsibility, integrity is respect for others, and shame is respect for oneself. This is consistent with the meaning of the three sentences in our ancient saying (be respectful in conduct, be respectful in work, and be loyal to others). In the past, our people ignored this meaning, did not know how to abide by the law, be responsible, respect others, and respect themselves. Then it is no wonder that they relied on their position to delay national affairs, and as a result, desecrated the dignity of constitutional government and deepened the suffering of the people. Today, we must recognize that our implementation of constitutional rule is to establish a long-term plan for the country. The question is not whether constitutional rule is implemented too early, but whether we have the sincerity to create a true constitutional government for the country. If everyone has this sincerity, we may as well promulgate the constitution before the completion of political tutelage, and at the same time, we can still implement the spirit of political tutelage, on the one hand, train the people and improve their understanding of national responsibilities and national politics, and on the other hand, train the government to improve the efficiency of politics at all levels. At the last meeting, I once said to you that our councilors should take on our responsibilities with the spirit of Yi Yin teaching Tai Jia and the Duke of Zhou teaching King Cheng. We not only use this spirit to teach the people, but also use this spirit to assist the government. The "teaching" of political tutelage originally did not have the meaning of being condescending. The word "teaching" in political tutelage is not scolding, but guidance, like a school tutor, patiently guiding students, putting themselves in their shoes to teach students, guiding them upwards, and not like an arrogant master, scolding servants condescendingly, making them embarrassed. Therefore, whether it is supervision or criticism, it is always well-intentioned guidance, not passive blame. Taking the precedents of Yi Yin teaching Tai Jia, the Duke of Zhou teaching King Cheng, and Zhuge Liang assisting the Later Lord, they themselves first had a spirit of public loyalty and responsibility, and an attitude of reverence and respect. Just like loyal ministers in history, standing in the court with righteous expressions, even if they were honest and outspoken, unwilling to compromise, they must straighten their clothes, straighten their appearance, and be dignified and solemn, as if facing important matters. This is the modern spirit of responsibility and discipline, and it is also the good habit of self-respect and respect for the personality of others in many democratic countries. Because China's politics and education have declined, this inherent national spirit has been lost. The habits of modern constitutional rule have also achieved nothing. The general public and young people are accustomed to frivolousness and carelessness in everything. I cannot hope that every citizen can reverse the decline in one day, but I sincerely hope that our colleagues in the National Political Council will put these meanings into practice and set a good example for the people, that is, to cultivate the foundation for implementing true constitutional government for the country. Finally, there is one more point that I do not hesitate to repeat to my colleagues. Because I am eager for the early completion of our revolutionary and national reconstruction cause, and I am eager for our country to implement constitutional government as soon as possible, have the scale of a modern country, and establish a foundation for survival, development, long-term stability, and security, I often think deeply about why our national affairs are so chaotic and disorganized and can never get on the right track. I feel that the evolution of political education in our Chinese history is very different before and after the Qin and Han dynasties. During the Zhou dynasty, we had a perfect parliamentary system, a complete administrative organization, and a military and political organization. We even implemented the well-field system and the Principle of People's Livelihood, and there was a concrete and subtle realization of social economy, without monopoly, oppression, inequality, and unfair phenomena. Everything in politics and society was orderly. Why did it decline day by day until today, with the phenomenon of chaos and decline, national weakness, and people's poverty, and encounter such serious foreign troubles? I have repeatedly thought deeply about the reason, and I believe that this is not only due to the loss of government and education after the Qin and Han dynasties, and the minority rulers and gentry stealing and establishing authority and exploiting the rights of the people, but also because before the Zhou dynasty, we used propriety as the outline of the rule of law, and social organization as the foundation of political organization. At that time, everything was organized and trained. Whether it was school, the army, society, or the family, the most important thing was to emphasize propriety, righteousness, and order. All citizens could not evade responsibilities and obligations, not only legal, but also moral. Because of this, the politics of the Zhou dynasty could be so prosperous. If we want to carry out revolution and build a country in the future, we must grasp this key point. We must know that no matter how complete the constitution and other laws are, if there are no people who enforce the law, abide by the law, and actively take responsibility for the country, these fundamental laws will become a mere scrap of paper and will not help national affairs in the slightest. We are not afraid of failing to win the War of Resistance or failing to build a country, but we are afraid of failing to restore the inherent spirit of our nation that values propriety and abides by the law. That is the real danger to our country's future. All colleagues must not think that these words of mine are empty and pedantic. In fact, this is the key to the rise and fall and survival of our nation. I hope that all colleagues will lead by example and lead the people to promote our inherent national spirit. In this way, we will surely be able to obtain the practical results of constitutional government, create more solid unity, more solid strength, and be able to assume our arduous responsibilities and achieve our sacred mission.

<p>Chongqing – It was closely observed here yesterday of the developments in US-Japan relations. Chinese officials claimed that they "absolutely do not believe" that the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation of 1911, after its expiration next month, would allow ordinary commerce between Japan and the US to continue as normal. This is because they believed that this move went beyond "diplomatic posturing." However, they warned the US to carefully consider the significance of past promises made by Japan. They believe that Japan's decision to reopen the Yangtze River cannot be regarded as a concession to the US, because Japan has no legal right to block the river. Officials pointed to the opening of the Yangtze River as "bait from Japan, and the promises made by Japan can be broken by Japan at any time." Therefore, they "hope that the US will not be misled by Japan and accept this step, lest they regret it in the future." (United Press International telegram from the 25th)</p>

<p>Kunming – The Myanmar delegation visiting China attended a public banquet held by various circles at 8 pm on the 24th. More than 100 guests and hosts attended, and the atmosphere was extremely cordial. During the banquet, Zhang Banghan delivered a speech, expressing welcome and gratitude to the delegation for coming to China during the period of our country's War of Resistance and visiting various places in Chongqing and Chengdu. Then, the leader of the delegation, U Ba Lwin, replied, saying that the delegation had been warmly received in various places in China, which was very appreciated. This visit to Yunnan, especially because Yunnan and Myanmar are adjacent, made them feel even more cordial. China and Myanmar have a long-standing friendship. Now that your country is fighting for peace in the Far East and the world, our two nations should work together to lay the foundation for permanent peace in the Far East. Even the Himalayas cannot isolate our friendship. After the banquet, delegation leader U Ba Lwin and deputy delegation leader Du Miya Xin made speeches to reporters. U Ba Lwin said that this visit to China has witnessed the national spirit of your country's people, like a awakened lion, and the leaders are loyal to the country and supported by the people, leading the work of resisting the war and building the country, and have embarked on the road to rejuvenation, which is very exciting. Although your country is currently suffering great sacrifices due to the War of Resistance, the future achievements will be unlimited, and its mission is like that of the United States in America and the Soviet Union in Europe. Even in terms of this War of Resistance, it is solely responsible for the sacred and great work of peace in the East. Therefore, its success can be predicted. Du Miya Xin said that the Chinese women's movement has penetrated into the countryside, and during this War of Resistance, the contribution of women to the country and the nation is no less than that of men. This element is truly a model for our Myanmar. (Telegram from the 24th)</p>

<p>Washington – Senator Borah, leader of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, met with reporters today and issued a statement saying, "I support efforts to maintain US-Japan commercial relations, but I am firmly opposed to the future export of arms from the United States to Japan." (Haitong telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>Washington – Senator Borah, a staunch isolationist in the United States, repeatedly stated yesterday that he advocated making all reasonable efforts after the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty of 1911 to maintain commercial relations between the two countries. Borah's telegram to Seattle lumber merchant representative Herbert stated that he would continue to oppose the sale of "munitions, arms, or instruments of war." Borah told reporters last night that he believed that US Ambassador to Japan Grew "should handle the situation with good judgment. My telegram should not be interpreted as containing any meaning, not only for commercial interests, but also for the sake of peace in the Far East, we must maintain peaceful trade relations with Japan." Borah stated, "I have no intention of working against China." (United Press International telegram from the 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" commented on the negotiations between Japan and the United States to extend the commercial treaty. The newspaper believes that although there are difficulties in the future of the negotiations, if both parties conduct negotiations with a friendly attitude and a constructive spirit, both parties can expect to reach an agreement. The "Hochi Shimbun" has a more negative attitude, stating that Japan does not object to respecting the open-door policy in China, but the implementation of this principle should be limited to trade and economic activities. As for politics and military affairs, the above principle cannot be applied. For example, Japan's opening of the Yangtze River is entirely for economic activities and has nothing to do with politics and military affairs. (Haitong telegram from the 25th)</p>

<p>Washington</p>
<p>President Roosevelt recently delivered a broadcast speech on Christmas Day, saying, "At the beginning of 1939, the world was generally afraid that a great disaster was about to come. Later, the war broke out as expected. Now, at the end of the year, the world has suffered because others do not treat each other with humanity. Some countries are suffering from war and the situation is very pitiful. We alone can live in peace, which can be said to be extremely fortunate. For our sake, we cannot just celebrate, but should sincerely pray to God to give us strength so that we can help others. In other words, we should follow the proverbs given by Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, pray to God, and make other nations also read this immortal treasure and understand its meaning."

<p>Rome - In a Christmas message to the College of Cardinals, the Pope expressed his thanks to President Roosevelt for his noble and generous efforts to mediate peace, and said that there were other important figures he was in contact with who were also trying to work towards peace, but he did not want to reveal their names. (Reuters telegram from the 15th)</p>
<p>Paris – After US President Roosevelt initiated the concentration of spiritual power from the three religions of Catholicism, Christianity, and Judaism to lay the foundation for lasting peace, Pope Pius XII also responded by giving a speech when he met with the Cardinals today. Responsible persons here expressed deep sympathy for the actions of President Roosevelt and the Pope, and said that President Roosevelt's repeated appeals and the diplomatic activities carried out by the Holy See have always been praised by the world. The Pope again condemned the policy of violence in his speech yesterday. The consensus of opinion between the Holy See and the US government can be clearly seen from this. Furthermore, President Roosevelt hopes to work with the Holy See at the appropriate time for lasting and fair peace. This is the first time that the United States and the Holy See have joined hands. His dispatch of Taylor as his personal representative stationed in the Holy See is a unique style of the President. Taylor himself represented the United States at the international conference on the resettlement of German and Austrian refugees in Evian, France, and is currently the chairman of the international committee appointed by the conference.

We are united in spirit and participate in a great war. The great Germany created by Fuehrer Hitler will surely have a day when it is safe.

<p>Paris - This year, due to the war and air defense, the residents of Paris celebrated Christmas with less fanfare than in previous years. However, churches in the city and its suburbs still held midnight masses yesterday. Hotels, having obtained special permits from the government, continued to operate until 2 a.m. today, enjoying booming business, especially with British and French army officers as their main patrons. To prevent air raids, hotels and entertainment venues were covered with thick curtains to prevent light from escaping, which did somewhat dampen the mood. In addition, a considerable number of army, navy, and air force officers and soldiers took leave to return to Paris to spend the Christmas holidays. These individuals, temporarily away from the front lines, reunited with their families, and their joy can be imagined. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris - Prime Minister Daladier issued a "Christmas Message to the Nation" this evening, emphasizing that France is fighting for victory and that this Christmas is a Christmas filled with hope. He also urged the nation to resolutely resist in order to defend freedom and independence. He said, "Tonight, I am not speaking as the leader of the government but as a close friend sharing your hardships, engaging in a frank discussion with all my compatriots. It has been nearly four months since Germany ignited the flames of disaster for the entire world. The events that have occurred during these four months are sufficient to prove that all responsibility should be borne by Germany. I recently had the Foreign Ministry's Yellow Book published in a popular edition, so that all compatriots, regardless of their circumstances, can have a copy in hand. The documents collected therein clearly show that the German authorities deliberately plotted to create a war, which cannot be concealed. We are now fighting to defend our homeland, which is true. However, we are still minimizing the sacrifices of our soldiers as much as possible, so that, to date, our military losses have been very small. On this Christmas Eve, I dare to ask my fellow countrymen to temporarily put aside the difficulties we are currently facing and focus on the great future. It should be known that our soldiers and leaders from all walks of life are preparing for the future with unwavering courage. We are fighting for the safety and freedom of your families so that you can all live and work in peace in the future. Consider that, to this day, countless millions of people in other nations across Europe are living in slavery, while we alone are still able to preserve all our rights, both materially and spiritually. Imagine the women and children in Prague, tonight without food or clothing, witnessing the joyous celebrations of foreign invaders, how resentful and disappointed they must be. Consider also the residents of Warsaw mourning on the battlefields and weeping bitterly for their lost freedom and happiness, as well as the Finnish people fighting hard in the frozen wilderness. All of these are lessons to be learned. When we reflect on this, how can we not be filled with righteous indignation? In my opinion, under these circumstances, all my compatriots must resolutely resist to defend their own freedom and independence and to guarantee freedom and the right to exist for all mankind."

<p>Paris - Today is Christmas Day. General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, issued a message to the soldiers, stating, "As this festive season arrives again and the new year is approaching, I extend my sincere congratulations to my comrades in the army. The cause we uphold is extremely great, and the soldiers on the front lines have fought bravely and achieved victories, so victory is within our grasp. No matter what strategies the enemy employs in psychological warfare or substantive warfare, we will be able to resist and achieve victory. This is no different from the beginning of the last European war." It is noted that General Gamelin is known for his silence, so the issuance of the message to the soldiers as above has great significance. This public figure has commanded the Allied forces for nearly four months, and has issued only two orders. The first order was issued on October 14, stating, "A major war could break out at any time. The fate of our country depends on the future of the war. This is what the whole country and the people of the world are watching. You must strive to be diligent and do your best. The two victories on the Marne River (September 1914) and Verdun (March 1916) should be remembered and not forgotten." The second order was issued on November 25, discussing the mobile warfare conducted by Germany on October 16, stating, "Since then, the German army has continued to prepare for an attack but has not dared to launch an offensive on the entire front. You must wait with resolute will for the arrival of events." (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e22">American Perceptions of the European War <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(New York Airmail) Former British Naval Secretary Duff Cooper, upon arriving in New York, published an article entitled "The European War and America," stating that anyone traveling to the United States at this time will have the initial impression that they are not traveling from one continent to another, but from one planet to another pleasant new planet. This planet is certainly not Mars (Mars is associated with the god of war). Its inhabitants are using giant telescopes to observe the more unfortunate Earth with great accuracy because the American side has swift and accurate records of everything happening in the Old World. Its comments are also extremely insightful and unbiased.</p>
<p>What we see and hear upon setting foot on this land is ever-increasing prosperity and a thriving culture. Most people are able to enjoy happiness, so they all have a belief that the United States should not be drawn into the vortex of war, no matter the cost. Europeans have no right to criticize this. Moreover, although the American people have this belief, they are not indifferent to the tragedies that are happening in the world or dismiss them without discussion. On the contrary, they are not only extremely concerned about the events happening in Europe, but they also deeply understand that this is related to American interests. Germany often declares to the people of Britain and the United States that the Treaty of Versailles is the source of all evil and that all the unfortunate events that have occurred in Europe are due to this treaty. Many people believe this idea. It not only represents an opinion, but it has almost become a recognized fact. However, in reality, the Treaty of Versailles, which was established in 1919, cannot be considered perfect now, but on the other hand, it was possible to sign an even worse treaty at that time. This is because representatives from various countries gathered in Paris to discuss how to revise the map of the world, and the work they undertook was not easy. Moreover, the countries they represented, witnessing the results of the great war, with countless lives lost, had a deep impression of the desolation of the situation at that time. In addition, after overcoming the pain, each country believed that Germany should bear the responsibility for the war, so they were extremely angry with Germany and wanted to retaliate. Under these circumstances, the representatives of each country still did their best to formulate this treaty in accordance with the principle of national self-determination, which is already commendable. Even in terms of its most severe clauses, it is much fairer than the most lenient clauses in the treaties that Germany signed with Russia and Romania. Not only that, although the Treaty of Versailles is regarded as the root of all evils, there are still some facts that we cannot forget in the past twenty years. After this treaty was signed, it was replaced by the Locarno Pact in less than six years. This pact was established with the full agreement of the countries concerned. "At the time of signing, the representatives of a free Germany also expressed that this pact was fair and glorious. From then on, the relationship between Britain, France, and Germany was no longer based on the Treaty of Versailles, but on the Locarno Pact. Therefore, if we consider the Treaty of Versailles to be a crime, we will inevitably go too far.</p>
<p>As for the issue that the American people are currently paying attention to, it is how the various issues should be resolved after the current war ends. Therefore, anyone traveling to the United States from Europe is asked about the war aims of the democratic countries. Europeans find this question surprising because people who are fighting to preserve their lives often do not have time to consider their war aims or what to do after winning. Therefore, Europeans have not paid much attention to this issue since the outbreak of the European war. On the contrary, observers on the other side of the Atlantic cannot help but consider this to be the most important issue. Therefore, we should answer it in a timely manner. However, how the map of Europe should be redrawn after the end of the war is our war aim. It is to build a new Europe, so that all countries can abide by faith in the future, and violence and aggression will disappear. In other words, all countries living in this new Europe, regardless of whether they are defeated or victorious, can coexist peacefully and share prosperity.</p>
<p>Secondly, the American people may have doubts about the fact that the war on the front lines is at a stalemate and that Britain, France, and Germany have not launched major offensives. Their state of mind is like us going to the theater to watch a tragedy. Before the curtain rises, we imagine that the plot must be very tragic, so we are nervous and sit in suspense. However, the stage does not reveal anything for a long time, so the audience asks, "When will the curtain rise?" This is doubt, not disappointment. Moreover, this kind of emotion is very natural, and the doubts it raises can be resolved. In short, this is a temporary phenomenon. We dare to assert that this question will soon be answered. At that time, it may even be considered too realistic and too cruel. (Havas News Agency)</p>

<p>Moscow - According to a communiqué issued by the Leningrad Military District, "There were no major developments on the front lines on the 24th, only fierce clashes in the Karelian Isthmus. As a result, the Finnish army left behind 971 bodies, and another 35 Finnish soldiers were captured, including four officers." (Tass News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - The General Headquarters issued a war report stating: (1) In the Karelian Isthmus, our patrol teams repeatedly invaded Soviet positions and engaged in activities. Afterwards, they returned to the defense lines. The Red Army launched two attacks between the towns of Kikokieve and Pannasjieville, but they were repelled. (2) In the area of the town of Aglaviejie, our army advanced victoriously, and the advance troops reached the town of Atojiekie between the cities of Somosalmi and Riajte. (3) Our army captured two tanks, many trucks, two flat-trajectory guns, and 100 horses. (4) Yesterday, the weather was clear, and Soviet aircraft flew to Apokotjia and Aikennanskoviezdou harbor to bomb and strafe civilians with machine guns. Our aircraft also took off and fought with enemy aircraft in various places, shooting down a total of 14 enemy aircraft. It could not be confirmed whether two more aircraft were shot down. We had no losses. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The war report issued yesterday by the Leningrad Soviet Army Headquarters stated that no major incidents had occurred on the front lines. There were several air battles, and 16 enemy aircraft were shot down. (Haitong News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Petsamo - A reporter from the Haitong News Agency sent a dispatch from Petsamo, a place on the Finnish front lines, stating that the climate here is extremely cold, 27 degrees below zero Celsius. The blizzard blowing from the northwest has lasted for six days, and it is getting worse tonight. Patrolmen are constantly sweeping snow. Snow is piled up into walls on both sides of the camp gate, as if one is in a snow palace. There was no fighting here today, but if the weather changes, the Soviet army withdrawing from the south will be a little far away from here tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Currently, all routes are closed due to snow accumulation, and tanks cannot move, but aircraft on both sides are making more use of the snow because the aircraft are equipped with strong ski skids. Today, looking south, we repeatedly saw aircraft coming and going, which should be Soviet aircraft supplying food to the troops withdrawing northeast of Salmijärvi. We received a broadcast report from Helsinki stating that the Soviet army has withdrawn in several places due to the climate. The Finnish army here hopes for reinforcements so that it can achieve the goal of surrounding the Soviet army in the Arctic region. If Finnish reinforcements do not arrive, the Finnish army will be at a disadvantage due to the disparity in numbers. Currently, the morale of the Finnish army is still very calm.

<p>Brussels - The Belgian Socialist Party held a Christmas congress this morning to discuss foreign policy. A motion was immediately passed to support a policy of neutrality, stating that once various changes occur in the international situation that are sufficient to threaten our country's freedom, territorial integrity, and vital interests, we will be forced to reconsider our policy of neutrality. However, neutrality does not mean prohibiting public opinion from expressing its views on the causes of the war and the things being fought for in euphemistic terms. In addition, the current government has made it clear that the independence and neutrality of the Netherlands is of utmost importance to Belgium. Our party is very satisfied with this statement. In short, the autocratic countries should be held responsible for initiating a policy of violence that led to the war. Our party hereby exposes them and sincerely hopes that all nations that have been invaded can regain their independence. It also expresses solidarity with the Second International (i.e., the Socialist International), advocating the establishment of lasting peace based on respect for the rights essential to the survival of all nations."

<h3 id="e31">Budgetary Battle in the Japanese Diet by John Ahlers, Translated from the Millard's Review of the Far East <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The budget session of the Japanese Diet and House of Peers for 1939-40 began on the 23rd in Tokyo. The demons of Japanese parliamentary politics have once again been temporarily unleashed. In reality, the Diet will begin in earnest next month, as it is customary to adjourn for the New Year holidays before the Diet formally opens. At that time, the demons of constitutional Japan will be allowed to appear and disappear on the political stage for three to four months until the funds requested by the government are approved by those who are supposedly representing the Japanese people. The performance, full of ghostly shadows, will come to an end with the final vote on Japan's 1940-41 budget, and Japanese parliamentary politics will once again sleep soundly for three seasons. The rulers of Japan often employ their strategies and are very successful. Therefore, they have no doubt that when the members of the Diet and House of Peers are allowed to see the light, they will not stubbornly resist, and will obediently and happily return to the darkness.</p>
<p>Of the two houses of the Japanese Diet, what was once a real budgetary battle has become merely a mock battle in recent years. Especially since the outbreak of the current Sino-Japanese War, there has been no real budgetary debate in Tokyo. The Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets have both presented budgets and made unprecedented monetary demands on the Japanese people, but these budgets have not been satisfactorily explained or justified, nor have they been criticized. The main item in the budget is the military's demand for armaments and war expenses, the amount of which far exceeds Japan's true total income. This year, military and war expenses account for almost one-third of Japan's total expenditures. So-called patriotic arguments are used as excuses for members of the Diet and House of Peers not to oppose these demands, and allow the heads of the army and navy to arrogantly, even rudely, issue extremely vague explanations, characterized by an unparalleled lack of certainty. The Diet and House of Peers only seriously discuss the minor items in the budget, and even then, they only pick out the insignificant ones for closer consideration and slight criticism.</p>
<p>Judging from the appearances, the situation in the 1939-40 budget session will not undergo fundamental changes. Japan's difficult economic situation and the prolonged war in China have resulted in some unrest among the Japanese people and increased misunderstandings among their ruling groups. The Abe government is particularly weak, lacking both resources and creativity. Diet politicians will likely stir up more intense noise than usual for the benefit of their supporters, and stage political dramas. The two major political parties, the Minseito and the Seiyukai, will use this opportunity to remind the people that these two parties have not completely disappeared and, while not actually maintaining the demand to participate in the Japanese government, they still maintain this demand in principle. However, it should not be mistaken that the Diet and House of Peers will raise any of the following fundamental budgetary issues: (1) the process of supplying funds for the war in China and huge armament replenishment; (2) the Japanese army and navy arbitrarily disposing of one-quarter of Japan's national income; (3) the huge deficit; (4) the unconstrained borrowing policy; (5) the increasing approach of Japanese national bankruptcy.</p>
<p>But these fundamental issues will lead to a fierce battle behind the scenes of Japanese parliamentary politics, not only between members of the Diet and the government, but also among the truly important figures in the government. The fierce battle began a few weeks ago when Finance Minister and Director-General of the Cabinet Planning Board Aoki drafted the budget and abandoned long-standing precedents. In previous years, only the regular budget was drafted before the budget meeting. The army and navy were accustomed to submitting special expense figures only after the Diet had been in session for some time. The army and navy had to tolerate any reductions in regular military spending, and they had the opportunity to recover the reduced amount in the special budget. But this year, Aoki firmly requested the army and navy to submit all their monetary demands in advance. After obtaining the budgets of the army and navy, Aoki bravely cut a huge sum of 2,000,000,000 yen from these budgets, and before the army and navy ministers could recover from their astonishment, he persuaded the cabinet to approve this cut and announce its regular and special budgets. The military opposed this, and the army and navy ministers had to strongly demand the return of the lost 2,000,000,000 yen. The behind-the-scenes struggle for this funding in the Japanese budget session, and the anger during the infighting, could lead to the collapse of the Abe cabinet and a rupture in the harmony of Japanese control over the war in China, which is not impossible.</p>
<p>Aoki is neither a "Great Liberal" nor a representative of Japanese private capitalism, but a semi-militarist expansionist and an enthusiast for "Greater Japan," fundamentally agreeing with the Japanese military, which makes his position more comfortable and stronger than his excellent predecessor Ikeda. However, Aoki has not forgotten his arithmetic and is closely familiar with Japan's serious economic and financial situation, and has come to the conclusion that Japan is unable to approve the huge demands additionally proposed by the army and navy, otherwise it will fall into financial disaster. Aoki understands that Japan has done its utmost in this regard and cannot do more than this, after going through great difficulties to meet the monetary demands of the army and navy personnel. The Tokyo military is about to implement a huge program, on the one hand continuing to fight in China on the previous scale, and on the other hand mechanizing all the newly formed army divisions. Aoki tried to make the army understand that for financial reasons, these two "New Year's gifts" cannot be obtained at the same time, and the army must decide which one to take. In fact, Aoki is prepared to give the Japanese military 330,000,000 yen more in the 1940-41 period than in the current fiscal year of 1939-40. The budget he drafted allocates the following funds to the Japanese army and navy:</p>
<p>Regular Budget</p>
<p>Army... 1,297,000,000 yen</p>
<p>Navy... 1,018,000,000 yen</p>
<p>Special Budget</p>
<p>Army... 2,973,000,000 yen</p>
<p>Navy... 737,000,000 yen</p>
<p>Reserve... 750,000,000 yen</p>
<p>Total... 6,757,000,000 yen</p>
<p>The total regular and special budget for Japan in 1940-41 reaches 10,360,000,000 yen, of which more than 600,000,000 yen will be handed over by the Tokyo government to the local authorities in Japan, so the true government budget is about 9,700,000,000 yen, of which military spending accounts for about six-tenths. Several other budget items, including indirect military spending, such as the public welfare budget, are almost entirely used to care for soldiers wounded in the war in China and the families of soldiers killed in the war in China. The budget for the Ministry of Finance has increased by 400,000,000 yen, mostly because the interest on the government bonds issued to compensate for military spending in China has increased. In total, the expenses of the army and navy, and the expenses required for the army and navy's adventures in China, account for more than seven-tenths of the total budget for 1940-41. If Aoki had approved the additional 2,000,000,000 yen demanded by the army and navy, then the total Japanese budget would have increased to 11,700,000,000 yen, of which almost 75 percent would have been allocated to the army and navy, which is completely beyond Japan's financial capacity.</p>
<p>Now, comparing Japan's revenue budget for 1940-41 with the above-mentioned expenditure figures, the ordinary revenue from existing sources is estimated to be only 3,418,000,000 yen. Japan will order a general tax increase, euphemistically called tax reform, and it is expected that the tax increase will generate another 731,000,000 yen in revenue. In that case, the estimated total revenue is 4,149,000,000 yen, which is about 1,000,000,000 yen higher than this year, with taxes continuing to increase by about 35 percent, but still short of the drafted total expenditure of 5,500,000,000 yen. The new domestic debt that the Tokyo government plans to issue in the next fiscal year starting on April 1, 1940, is also around 5,500,000,000 yen. The government bonds issued in this fiscal year are planned to be 5,900,000,000 yen. From this situation, it seems that Japan is beginning to slightly reduce the issuance of government bonds, but this impression is false, because the Tokyo government is delaying the huge amount of government bond issuance rights that have not yet been used, and plans to use these issuance rights in 1940-41, when the government bonds actually issued will be far larger than in any previous year.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this war in China, Japan has issued 10,662,000,000 yen worth of domestic debt. Therefore, the national debt, which was 10,580,301,000 yen at the end of June 1937, had increased to 20,859,382,000 yen by the end of last month. Adding the government bonds to be issued in the remaining days of this fiscal year and the 5,500,000,000 yen planned to be issued in 1940-41, will increase the national debt to more than 28,000,000,000 yen. The interest and zero amortization of this stupid debt alone will require more than 2,000,000,000 yen, which actually accounts for half of Japan's estimated total regular revenue in the next fiscal year. From these figures, it is not surprising that the Japanese Finance Minister feels that he cannot add more funds in his new budget. These budgets account for no less than one-third of Japan's current national income. In the past few months, Japan's ability to absorb government bonds has decreased, while inflation has continued to increase. The Bank of Japan's issuance of banknotes is repeatedly setting new records.</p>
<p>Japan's finances have begun to become an irreversible situation. Even if Aoki is tough enough to make the military's additional demand for 2,000,000,000 yen fail, the final disaster and collapse has already shown signs.</p>

<h3 id="e32">All Sectors Enthusiastically Celebrated National Renaissance Day Yesterday, Believing That Under the Leadership of the Leader, Striving Hard Will Surely Complete the Mission of National Renaissance <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was National Renaissance Day and the 24th Anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. In accordance with the Central Government's regulations, the Zhaowei Memorial was also held jointly. All sectors of the city unanimously and enthusiastically celebrated. All agencies, public organizations, and schools also had a holiday as usual. All sectors recalled that in the early years of the Republic, Yuan Shikai attempted to restore the monarchy, and the foundation of the revolution was on the verge of collapse. Fortunately, the martyrs Cai E and others organized the National Protection Army and launched an uprising in Yunnan. Various provinces responded, shattering Yuan's dream of restoring the monarchy, and the foundation of the Republic was re-established. They also recalled the Xi'an Incident three years ago, when the Leader, with his great revolutionary personality and determination to believe in the Three Principles of the People, and with the universal support of the people of the whole country, finally turned danger into safety and returned to the capital. Since then, the whole country has formed an unprecedented unity and launched the sacred War of Resistance, working hard until today. At this time, the military situation of the War of Resistance is becoming increasingly favorable. It is firmly believed that under the leadership of the Leader, through hard work, the great mission of resisting the war, building the country, and reviving the nation will surely be completed. As for the 28th National Renaissance Day commemorative bookmarks that replaced New Year's cards, they are divided into five types: Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom, and Faith. They have a portrait of the President and the four characters "Happy New Year," and also record the President's instructions.</p>
<p>All Sectors Promote Thrift and Disaster Relief</p>
<p>All sectors, in accordance with the General Order on Economic Thrift, unanimously promoted thrift and stored up national resources. Also, in view of the fact that it is winter and the displaced people are still worried about insufficient food and clothing, they have successively saved on Christmas gifts and transferred them to help the displaced people. Some even brought items to the refugee hospitals to visit sick refugees. The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association on Chihama Road sold Christmas Anti-Tuberculosis seals this year to raise funds for the anti-tuberculosis cause. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of all parties, the results were very satisfactory.</p>

<p>Since Nanshi was occupied by the Japanese, all kinds of organizations have emerged. Regarding military affairs, there are the Japanese Military Police and the Japanese Garrison. Regarding police affairs, there are the "Nanshi Police Bureau," the "Kensatsu Squad," and the "Self-Defense Corps." Regarding "politics," there is the "Nanshi District Political Affairs Office." Regarding "education," in addition to the "Avenue Elementary School," the "Old Vocational School" was reorganized into the same kind of "school." Regarding "industry," the Gaochangmiao Shipyard and other iron factories were placed under the name of the Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation. For small industries and workers, the "Political Affairs Office" organized an Industry and Commerce Federation to embezzle them. However, for shops and other businesses, the "Political Affairs Office" sent personnel to establish a "City Chamber of Commerce." All income was managed by the "Office," and Yin Zuotong was appointed as "Supervisor" to supervise it. Zhang Binru, a puppet (formerly the stage manager of the Xin Wu Tai), was selected as the "President," and Zhou Xianyue was selected as the Vice President.

<h3 id="e36">Wu Mulan's Life Story <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Wu Mulan's life story, compiled from interviews, is as follows. Ms. Wu, named Mulan, courtesy name Youzhi, is 50 years old and from Fuzhou, Jiangxi. She lives in Room 5, Hongren Lane, Lafayette Road, Shanghai, having moved from Nanjing Sitiao Lane. At the age of 18 (i.e., at the end of the Guangxu period), she studied in Japan, met Sun Yat-sen, and participated in the revolution, traveling at home and abroad and being responsible for contacting overseas student organizations. During the Xinhai Revolution, she served as the Commander-in-Chief of the Women's Northern Expeditionary Army. During Yuan Shikai's reign, she served as an advisor to the Presidential Palace. Later, due to her opposition to the Twenty-One Demands and Yuan's attempt to become emperor, she was arrested and imprisoned for assassinating Yuan. She was released after Yuan's death. When Ge Jing'en was the president of the Cultural College, he hired her as a director. In 1929, when Ju Zheng was arrested in Shanghai, she rescued and released him. When Wang Zhengting was the Minister of Judicial Administration, he appointed her as a member of the Ministry of Judicial Administration and the president of the Nanjing Women's Law and Politics Training Institute and the president of the Nanjing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society. After the August 13 Incident, she organized rescue teams in the Su, Zhe, Wan, and Gan areas and handled women's work in the rear. When the National Army retreated from Nanjing, she was one of the last to withdraw. She went through Jiangxi, Hankou, Guangdong, and Hong Kong, and arrived in Shanghai in September of last year, residing on Route du Père Huc. This spring, she moved to Wanyi Lane on Rue Luber, and in the summer, she moved to Room 5, Hongren Lane, Lafayette Road.</p>
<p>This summer, when Zuo Yanhan and others from the people of Jiangsu and Anhui heard that she was in Shanghai, they invited Jingbo, the retired abbot of Qingliang Temple in Shanghai and former president of the Chinese Buddhist Association, and earnestly requested her to serve the country and save the people. In September, she was appointed by the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government as the Commander-in-Chief of the Central Su-Wan Border Defense Reserve Team. Just as she was preparing to leave Shanghai to formally take office, she became ill and resided at the Continental Hotel, and on the 6th of this month, she moved to Room 10 of the Huabei Apartment to avoid attention. At approximately 9:15 a.m. on the 20th of this month, she was suddenly killed in the Huabei Apartment. The French Concession Police Department transported her body to the mortuary on Route Jules Tillot for an autopsy. At 11:00 a.m. on the 23rd, Wang, a prosecutor appointed by the Second District Court of the Shanghai Special District, conducted an examination and determined that she had been shot once in the head and once in the chest, and had bled to death. Her body was claimed by her son, Wu Zhenqiu, and her adopted son, Zhou Peibao, at 3:00 p.m. and placed in the White Palace Funeral Home on Great Western Road. The funeral was held at 2:00 p.m. on the 24th. Guests included Wen Lanting, Wang Peiyuan, and Mrs. Zhang Fengjiu. She was previously married to Commander Wang Jiannong, but later divorced due to circumstances. Wang became a monk and died of illness. She had a son named Zhenqiu, who used her surname, and is now 18 years old and a second-year student at Qianbo Middle School. This summer, he married Li Manjun as his wife, who is 18 years old and from Beiping, and is studying at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts on Caishi Road. She had a adopted daughter named Yinjiao, who is 16 years old, and an adopted son, Zhou Peibao, who is in his twenties and a lawyer, living at No. 18, Lane 29, Seymour Road. She was generous, chivalrous, and kind. She was close friends with Ju Jusheng, Wang Daichun, Wen Lanting, Ge Jingen, Wang Kecheng, Ji Zhongshu, Wang Zhuoshan, Dai Jitao, Yu Youren, Jiao Yitang, and Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Fengjiu. She believed in Buddhism and took refuge in Master Taixu.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Christmas Day Double Murder in Shanghai: Four Dead, Two Injured; Outside the Zhaofeng Casino <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The Zhaofeng Casino on Yu Yuan Road in Western Shanghai, to attract gamblers and avoid external criticism, usually operates under the guise of the Huierdeng Ballroom. It was once embroiled in a dispute over gambling between Japanese nationals, leading to the revocation of its license by the Japanese authorities. However, through repeated maneuvering, the casino was allowed to resume operations. Unexpectedly, another shooting occurred at the casino yesterday morning, resulting in two deaths and one injury. It is reported that around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, a group of men inside the casino, their gambling spirits waning, entered the Huierdeng Ballroom, each escorting a partner for dancing. Around 3:30 AM, the dancers, after some pleasant conversation, slowly strolled out of the casino. As they reached the road from the driveway, someone lying in ambush opened fire, shooting several times. The leading dancer immediately fell to the ground, while the second was shot in the head and collapsed in a pool of blood. At the time, a Wuxi native named Liu Heng (38 years old) was also hit in the head and chest, and collapsed, barely alive. Stray bullets flew in all directions, and the casino's gamblers, unaware of the situation, fled in terror. The doormen also took off. The shooter jumped into a car with license plate number 12141 parked by the roadside and sped away. Upon receiving the news, the Public Concession Police dispatched a large force to investigate, and an ambulance took one of the injured dancers to Tongren Hospital, where he soon died due to his injuries. At the same time, Japanese military police also arrived. Another dancer was taken away by the Japanese in a car. Liu Heng, barely alive, was also taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment, but died shortly after arrival. It has been learned that the dancer who died at Tongren Hospital was named Chen Mingchu. The person taken away by the Japanese was He Xingjian, a former special commissioner of the Pudong Loyal Patriotic Army, who has since left that position and is now working elsewhere. He was reportedly taken by the Japanese to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou, suffering from a severe head injury. Chen was He's subordinate. Liu was a silk merchant living at No. 5 Jinshou Lane on Shandong Road. It is still unknown whether this shooting is related to politics or a personal feud.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Detailed Account of the Incident in Western Newspaper <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that at 3:50 AM this morning (December 25th), three Chinese men were shot by unidentified assassins in the dark alley outside the back door of the Huierdeng Ballroom on Yu Yuan Road, resulting in two deaths and one injury. The deceased were identified as Chen Mingchu and Liu Heng, a silk worker residing at No. 5 Jingxiu Lane (transliteration) on Shandong Road. The injured man was reportedly He Xingjian, the former commissioner of the Loyal Patriotic Army stationed in Shanghai, who suffered a severe head injury and was taken by a Japanese car to a hospital in Hongkou. As of this afternoon, his latest condition is unknown. Chen suffered chest wounds and was taken to Tongren Hospital near the scene of the shooting. Despite doctors' efforts, he succumbed to his injuries. Liu was taken to the Gu Ge Road Red Cross Hospital, where injuries were found on his face and chest, and he died within minutes of arrival. The bodies of the two deceased were not allowed to remain in the hospital. This morning, two groups of Japanese nationals went to Tongren Hospital and the Red Cross Hospital to claim the bodies, which were taken away by car to an unknown location. According to those near the scene, the shooting occurred suddenly, and it is impossible to determine whether the assassins were one or several. However, it is said that a total of six shots were fired. One account states that Chen Mingchu drove his car (license plate number 3190) to the Huierdeng Ballroom around 3:00 AM this morning. After sitting for a while, he met with He Xingjian, exchanged a few words, and then exited the back door of the ballroom, presumably heading to the gambling hall, as a small path connects the gambling hall and the ballroom. Less than a minute after the two left the door, they were suddenly shot from behind and fell to the ground. Liu Heng, apparently standing very close to the two, was also hit by the gunfire. Customers in the gambling hall and ballroom scattered in panic upon hearing the gunshots, causing great chaos. The Public Concession Police Department will not investigate this case because it occurred outside the concession area.</p>

<p>Inside the Cunxintedantang Pharmacy at 599 Connaught Road, Gordon Road intersection in the Western District of the Public Concession, several people suddenly opened fire on a well-dressed young man in a Western suit around 8:00 PM last night, killing two and injuring one. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Gunshots Sounded: The Cunxintedantang Pharmacy had just opened yesterday, and many guests from all walks of life came to offer congratulations. The pharmacy hosted a banquet in the store last night at 8:00 PM to entertain the guests. As the festivities were in full swing, several unfamiliar men suddenly broke in. As the guests were still in shock, gunshots rang out, causing everyone to panic and scramble for escape.</p>
<p>Youth Killed: One of the men killed was a young man named Gu Guoqing, wearing a striped flannel Western suit and a black overcoat, with chicken leather shoes. He was shot twice in the head, once in the hand, and once in the chest, and died before he could be treated.</p>
<p>Guest Dies: In addition, the owner of the pharmacy, Li Linfu, was thanking the guests when he was also shot twice, once in the chest and once in the waist. Due to the vital nature of the injuries, he died shortly after. It was later learned that Li resided at No. 3 Sanyi Lane on Xin Zha Road and was a native of Changzhou, 49 years old. He was also a shareholder in the Jisheng Stock at No. 10, Lane 195, Fujian Road.</p>
<p>Apprentice Injured: At the time, the pharmacy's apprentice, Han Shixin, 16 years old, had been unemployed for a long time and had only recently found work. He was serving the guests at the scene yesterday when he was unexpectedly hit by a stray bullet in the right thigh. He was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. After the incident, the shooters scattered. The police, upon receiving the report, dispatched detectives to investigate and collected the bullets for further examination.</p>
<h3 id="e40">No Plans to Increase Domestic Postal Rates; Shanghai Post Office Unaware of Rate Hike; Postal Rates Increased Once in 1932 <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Rumors of an increase in domestic postal rates are untrue. The Shanghai postal authorities are also unaware of any such increase. It is known that the Directorate General of Posts increased domestic postal rates in 1932. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Domestic Postal Rates</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Shanghai Postal Administration, prior to 1932, the domestic rate for ordinary letters was only 4 cents, the local rate for ordinary letters was only 1 cent, the domestic rate for postcards (single) was only 2 cents, and double postcards were also only 4 cents. On May 1, 1932, the Directorate General of Posts submitted a new postal rate, which was approved by the Ministry of Communications, increasing the domestic rate for ordinary letters to 5 cents, the local rate for ordinary letters to 2 cents, the rate for postcards (single) to 2.5 cents, and double postcards to 5 cents.</p>
<p>No Increase</p>
<p>At that time, nationals from both local and other areas believed that the increase was too large and telegraphed the Ministry of Communications and the Directorate General of Posts to reconsider. Therefore, the implementation was delayed until May 20 of that year, demonstrating the careful consideration given to this matter by the Ministry of Communications and the postal authorities. However, rumors of another increase in domestic postal rates have recently surfaced. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Shanghai postal authorities, this claim is absolutely untrue. To date, the bureau is unaware of any such rumors.</p>

<p>The National YMCA of this city received a telegram from Kunming yesterday, reporting the death of Shang Ai (an American), director of the municipal association's group department, in Kunming. Shang had served in China for nearly 20 years and was always enthusiastic. Although his health had been declining recently, he was particularly dedicated to his work out of sympathy for China. Two months ago, he worked in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou. After attending the general secretary conference of the YMCA in Chongqing, he planned to go to Yangon via the Yunnan-Burma Road and then to various ports in Southeast Asia to raise funds for the association's wartime service work. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Kunming, he died suddenly of heart disease on the morning of the 24th. The association was deeply saddened by this tragic news.</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that news had been received in this city that M. Manson, who has been tirelessly engaged in YMCA activities in China for many years, recently attended a meeting of YMCA leaders in Chongqing and died suddenly of heart disease on his way back to Shanghai. He passed away in Kunming yesterday (24th) morning. Mr. Manson was born in the state of Iowa in the United States in 1877 and graduated from Grinnell College in 1909.

<p>In Shanghai, the public transportation includes automobiles, trams, and rickshaws. The latter—the rickshaw, although a backward means of transportation, is still an important means of transportation for the general public in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After the war, Shanghai was considered a haven for refugees, and the population increased dramatically. The number of rickshaws in the Public Concession did not decrease but remained at nearly 10,000. The French Concession currently has only three or four thousand rickshaws. Before the war, there were about 10,000 rickshaws, including those in the Chinese area. This type of rickshaw is commonly known as "small license" and can only operate within the French Concession. As for the rickshaws in the Public Concession, commonly known as "large license," they can operate in both concessions. Currently, the total number of rickshaws in the two concessions is about 13,400. Each rickshaw is pulled by four people in shifts, so there are 55,600 rickshaw pullers. Compared with the number of people in various industries, rickshaw pullers account for a large number.</p>
<p>The life of a rickshaw puller is said to be the most arduous of all manual labor. In the scorching heat of summer, they still have to run regardless of their lives; in the windy, rainy, and snowy winters, they have to live like beasts of burden for the sake of livelihood. These days, the weather is bitterly cold, especially at night. The cold is biting. On the dead-like streets, under the dim lights, rickshaw pullers without customers wander around aimlessly. This scene is bleak enough!</p>
<p>There are regulations for rickshaw pullers to pull their rickshaws. On average, four people pull a rickshaw, day and night. (After the war, due to the curfew, there were some restrictions.) Each day is divided into two shifts, each shift being 12 hours: from 4:00 AM to 4:00 PM is one shift, and from 4:00 PM to 4:00 AM the next morning is another shift. The daily rental is 77 cents per rickshaw. After the war, because the population increased significantly, their business was better than before the war. The price for a day's work is about two yuan. This income seems not bad, but after deducting the rickshaw rental, the remaining one yuan is barely enough to sustain an individual. If there is a family, it is difficult. However, the proportion of rickshaw pullers with families in Shanghai is just under 95%. Among the rickshaw pullers' family members, wives, sisters, and daughters may be able to find some work to supplement the income, but the main livelihood still depends on the price of pulling the rickshaw. Currently, prices are high, and their lives are even more difficult.</p>
<p>Their lives are very simple. Single men live in the homes of those who lease out the rickshaws. Before the war, they did not charge rent. After the war, they charged a small amount of rent, about three or four cents per shift. Rickshaw pullers with families mostly build their own shacks in the areas beyond the borders of the Western Shanghai Concession. Some build them alone, and others build them together. Therefore, the shantytown areas of Western Shanghai have become the concentration points of rickshaw pullers.</p>
<p>There are many organizations that help rickshaw pullers with their lives. In the Public Concession, there is a Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society.</p>
<p>The post-war clubhouse of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Society is located across from the Great World on Edward VII Avenue. In addition, there are three branches in the east, south, and west. Anyone who has a rickshaw puller's license issued by the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau can become a member. Members do not need to pay any fees. The society's funds mainly come from the vehicle license fees collected by the Bureau. The Bureau donates 1.5 yuan for each rickshaw, which amounts to about 14,000 yuan per month. The main tasks of the society are divided into: administration, medical affairs, intellectual development, mutual assistance, insurance, dispute mediation, and improvement of living standards. It has held several campaigns in the past, such as health campaigns, epidemic prevention campaigns, safety campaigns, and adult education campaigns.</p>
<p>The society's investigation into the lives of rickshaw pullers has revealed several meaningful points. For example: Regarding knowledge, statistics show that among more than 5,000 people, 3,578 were illiterate, accounting for just under 71%. Regarding hobbies, the most common hobbies are smoking, drinking, and gambling. A small number of rickshaw pullers also smoke opium and heroin, spending all of their day's hard-earned money on these vices. As for the rickshaw pullers' origins, those from Yancheng, Funing, Tongzhou, and Taixian account for about two-thirds of all rickshaw pullers, with those from Yancheng and Funing being the largest groups.</p>
<p>In short, the purpose of the society is to seek the happiness of rickshaw pullers and improve their living conditions and to provide rickshaw pullers with various benefits and conveniences. Therefore, the society has established its own hospital to relieve the suffering of sick rickshaw pullers. In addition to running adult education classes, it also runs schools for their children. It also has a reading room, with newspapers such as Shen Bao, Xin Wen, Chung Mei, and various pictorials. It is said that many rickshaw pullers go to the reading room to relax after a hard day's work. This is probably due to the effectiveness of the adult education classes established by the society in imparting knowledge.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that, according to the society's report, it handled 3,990 mutual assistance cases this year, with rice cases being the most numerous, followed by funeral events. Currently, with rising prices, the lives of the large number of rickshaw pullers are bound to be threatened. At this time, it is hoped that the society will continue its previous spirit and seek welfare for these rickshaw pullers. If circumstances permit, it may be worthwhile to purchase foreign rice and organize sales at stable prices, which would not only benefit the rickshaw pullers themselves but also be extremely beneficial to society.</p>

<p>Recently, some local ruffians, facing difficult times due to high rice prices and the rising cost of everything, seized the opportunity to use counterfeit money to deceive the ignorant masses. The number of victims is countless. Wang Cheng, the Chinese detective chief of the Gordon Road police station, along with detectives Xu Decheng and Wu Dekui, learned that Liu Jizhong from Tianjin was one of the counterfeit money distributors. They sent an informant posing as a customer with thirty yuan of genuine currency marked secretly. They agreed with Liu Jizhong on the price and arranged to meet at a certain location on Beijing Road at 1:30 PM to make the exchange. Chinese and foreign detectives observed the area. When Liu Jizhong arrived and met the informant, he was arrested. Ten five-yuan counterfeit bills were found on his person. He confessed that his accomplice, Liu Xueke from Shandong, was hiding at No. 12, Lane 66, Xin Zha Road. Chinese and foreign detectives rushed to the address and arrested him, confiscating over five hundred five-yuan "Jiaotong" and "Zhongyang" counterfeit bills, along with his wife, Liu Sunshi, who was also arrested. Further arrests were made at No. 36, Taian Lane, Tiantong Road, and No. 57, Lane 41, Taoerfeisi Road in the French Concession, where accomplices Zhang Keqin from Shandong, Pan Wenbao from Pudong, Zhang Wangshi, a woman from Jiangsu, and Li Shengshi, a woman from Jiangbei, were apprehended. Another large quantity of over two thousand counterfeit bills was confiscated. A total of seven male and female suspects were arrested, and 2,660 five-yuan (farmer "Jiaotong" "Zhongyang") counterfeit bills were seized. All were taken back to the police station and detained separately. The next morning, along with the evidence, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case, stating that the defendants Liu Jizhong and Liu Xueke were repeat offenders, and the others were involved in activities such as consuming opium pills, receiving stolen counterfeit money, and soliciting customers. He requested an extension to investigate the main source of the counterfeit money. Subsequently, Chinese and foreign detectives reported the details of the case. When the evidence, the counterfeit bills, was presented, lawyer Li further stated that the ten yuan of genuine national currency given by the police informant to the first defendant, Liu Jizhong, for purchasing counterfeit money should be returned first. The court approved this. Judge Huang Risheng questioned each defendant and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further review at a later date.</p>

<p>Xiang Meixiang, a 25-year-old woman from Ningbo currently residing at No. 23 Ningbo Road in the British Concession, married Shen Jiaju, a 28-year-old local Catholic living at No. 45 Taoyuan Village, Lafayetter Road, on April 27, 1935. After four years of marriage, due to Shen's illness, they had never consummated the marriage. Xiang felt that her youth was wasted, her happiness was deprived, and there was little hope of growing old together. She hired a lawyer to file for divorce with the Second Special Court's Civil Division, seeking the return of her dowry of 12,000 yuan, alimony of 30,000 yuan, and monthly living expenses of 200 yuan from June 1, 1936, until the date of the final judgment. The initial trial resulted in a verdict against the plaintiff. Therefore, Xiang, dissatisfied, engaged lawyer Jiang Yiping to represent her and appealed to the High Third Branch Court. The respondent, Shen Jiaju, hired lawyer Tang Hao to represent him. Judge Tong Jishi repeatedly convened investigative hearings, summoning witnesses, family members, and relatives from both sides for questioning. After deliberation by the collegial panel, the debate was declared closed. The verdict was originally scheduled to be announced yesterday afternoon. However, it was learned that the presiding judge felt that the case was not yet fully understood and required further investigation before a final decision could be made to satisfy both parties. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday, Presiding Judge Xia Quande announced the adjournment of the debate and scheduled a new hearing for further questioning and reopening of the debate.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stating that according to a report from Anhui Province on November [blank], the Wuhu branch of a certain Japanese trading company was purchasing large quantities of vegetable cakes for unclear purposes. The Ministry requested a reply on whether to prohibit their export. As vegetable cakes can be used as fertilizer and feed, they should be designated as prohibited exports. The Ministry has notified the Chamber accordingly. Additionally, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has designated cornelian cherries, corydalis rhizome, and yellow wax as prohibited export items. Since this has not been publicly announced, some merchants are still unaware. It is now known that the Ningbo Wartime Shipping Administration and the Zhejiang Customs have re-notified all medicinal material merchants, instructing them not to declare these items for export.</p>

<p>Direct transportation between Nanshi and the concessions, after the French Concession opened the Xin Kaihe iron gate, suddenly became difficult because the "Citizen's Pass" for October, November, and December was not allowed to pass. This caused suffering for the public. Although philanthropists requested leniency, and it was approved for travel via the Nanmatou ferry via Pudong, this made the opening of the iron gate for the convenience of the people and the prosperity of the market pointless. It is now learned that after discussions between the Japanese Consulate and the Nanshi garrison, the "Citizen's Pass" issue has been clarified. From January 1, 1940, regardless of the month of issue, the "Citizen's Pass" can still be used for direct transportation through the Xin Kaihe iron gate.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Jian De Bank Bankruptcy Case: Both Parties File Appeals; High Second Branch Court Holds Investigative Hearing Yesterday, Adjourned Due to Lack of Time <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Jian De Commercial Savings Bank ceased operations and went bankrupt on December 7, 1934. On July 24, 1935, the First Special District Court ruled the bank bankrupt and appointed accountant Li Ding as the bankruptcy administrator. Lawsuits arose between creditors and bank directors and supervisors before and after the bankruptcy. For example, Director Xie Keming and others were fined between 1,000 and 1,500 yuan for making false statements during capital increase registration and for failing to file for bankruptcy when the company's assets were insufficient to cover its debts. They were also held jointly liable for compensating for the false capital of over 240,000 yuan. The registration of the limited liability company was also revoked by order of the Ministry of Finance and Industry. This spring, creditors Zhou Shougan, Xue Yifan, Wei Haijiang, and Wang Ruyao, along with lawyers Sun Zuji, Xi Mengqi, and Gu Kenfu, sued Xie Keming, Yu Yuanxiang, Yan Fanfang, and Qin Wenqun in the First Special Court, alleging that the bankrupt and the bankruptcy administrator colluded to represent false debts, hindering the rights of the bankruptcy estate and bankruptcy creditors, and privately collecting loans, altering accounts, and forging signatures. Judge Jiang concluded the hearing and sentenced Xie Keming and Yu Yuanxiang to one year of imprisonment each for jointly forging documents and one year of imprisonment each for continuous joint breach of trust. The two sentences were combined, and each was to serve one year and two months of imprisonment. Yan Fanfang and Qin Wenqun were each sentenced to six months of imprisonment for joint breach of trust, with a three-year suspended sentence. Both sides, dissatisfied with the judgment, entrusted their original lawyers to file appeals with the High Second Branch Court. The reasons for the appeal by the defendants Xie Keming and others were that they suffered heavy losses due to the Jian De Bank's bankruptcy and never purchased the claims of bankruptcy creditors to manipulate creditor meetings or fabricate creditor names to rig the election. If there were any deficiencies in the procedures of commercial transactions, they did not violate criminal law. They requested that the original judgment be revoked and that they be found not guilty. The reasons for the appeal by the plaintiffs Zhou Shougan and others were that the original court imposed too light a sentence on Xie Keming and others because the scams set up by Xie Keming and others not only harmed individuals but also harmed the entire society, causing people to lose confidence in banks and to fear bankruptcy, thus disrupting social economy. Their crimes were not driven by the needs of life. Now that their long-term conspiracy to manipulate the law and commit fraud has been exposed, they should be severely punished to deter the cunning and stubborn. According to the filings, the High Second Branch Court summoned both parties to court yesterday for an investigative hearing. However, due to the large number of cases and limited time, they were not questioned in detail. They were only briefly questioned about their age, address, and the simple reasons listed above. The hearing was then adjourned to a later date.</p>

<p>Shanghai Women's Bank leased the houses in Qing Yu Li, Chongqing Road. According to the contract between the bank and the owner, the Poor Children's Education Institute, the houses had to be rebuilt starting on January 1 of this year. Otherwise, the bank would be subject to a fine of more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the bank filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court, requesting all tenants in Qing Yu Li to vacate the premises. The more than 3,000 tenants of Qing Yu Li argued that it was a difficult time to find housing and that the Women's Bank's decision to rebuild the houses at this time was inappropriate. The case has been litigated for years, and the tenants have lost in all three trials. Just as enforcement was about to begin, the tenants of Qing Yu Li suddenly found crucial evidence that had not been discovered in previous court hearings, namely that the Women's Bank had signed an agreement with the Poor Children's Education Institute during the second trial to extend the rebuilding period by three years. Therefore, rebuilding was not immediately necessary. They hired lawyers Yuan Yang'an, Su Jingqi, and Yu Chengxiu to file a petition for retrial with the High Second Branch Court, which was approved. The hearing has concluded. Yesterday morning at approximately 11:00 AM, High Second Branch Court Judge Han Zuzhi, along with Judges Shen Hongzhang and Qing Lan, convened court and announced the verdict. The original judgment was overturned. The plaintiffs in the retrial, Ping Jin'ya et al. (i.e., the Qing Yu Li tenants), were ordered to hand over the houses to the Shanghai Women's Bank at the end of December 1940. Therefore, the tenants were granted a one-year extension before having to move.</p>

<p>To the Editor: We have read your newspaper's December 20th edition, page 3, where it was mentioned in the rice market transaction column that rice prices were lower in the Wusong area and that our company, among others, was purchasing rice there, making a large profit of five to six yuan per dan on each transaction. There are no fewer than dozens of rice shops in the entire town of Gaoqiao, and our company alone cannot monopolize the market. Due to the sale of our entire inventory, we did go to Wusong to purchase rice once, but the rice price had already reached more than 30 yuan. Not only was there no profit to be made, but we also had to pay expenses. This is completely inconsistent with the facts. We respectfully request that your newspaper make a correction.

<h3 id="e63">Overview of the Unified Entrance Examination for This Year's Universities (14) <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(3) Problems with the System Itself: Some people believe that there is no need to implement the unified enrollment system at present. Their position is that enrollment is a type of school administration and should be handled by each school independently. There is no need for the government to coordinate it. In particular, universities have complex departments, and each department has its own characteristics. Independent enrollment can maintain these characteristics. Implementing unified enrollment and adopting uniform standards are insufficient to adapt to the characteristics of each school. This argument is not without reason, but upon careful study, it is not entirely true. Because each school enrolls independently, the standards are extremely inconsistent. Some have high admission standards, while others have low admission standards. Each acts on its own. Some particularly emphasize basic subjects, while others emphasize other unnecessary subjects, causing students to travel back and forth to take exams and prepare for various incompatible subjects. Regarding the exam questions, many schools set questions that exceed the high school curriculum standards, even using English exam questions, restricting answers in English, or, due to custom, not allowing answers in classical or vernacular Chinese. The difficulty of the exam questions varies greatly. Such situations cannot be considered appropriate. Furthermore, from the student's perspective, traveling back and forth to take exams at multiple schools, followed by exams at each school after the joint exam, is mentally painful. In the past, students from remote provinces and regions often hesitated to apply to their desired schools due to long distances or economic difficulties. Students apply to multiple schools, the examinees are the same, the subjects are similar, and the time is close, but the schools are different, the locations are different, the exam questions are different, the admission standards are different, wasting time, effort, money, and energy. During this time of war, transportation is extremely difficult. This enrollment method needs to be improved. Therefore, the trial implementation of the unified exam and the establishment of the unified exam system are necessary. However, the purpose of the unified exam is not entirely this. It is still to establish consistent standards and gradually improve students' levels. Unified enrollment is not about lowering standards and admitting more students, but about rationally adjusting university education based on actual needs.</p>
<p>(11) Personal Opinions</p>
<p>The above sections have described the significance of the unified exam, the handling situation, and general criticisms. In summary, the unified exam system itself can be said to have the value of existing and continuing to be implemented. However, in terms of methods, because it has only been implemented for two years, there are indeed many areas that still need improvement. I can say that the unified exam and the joint exam are equally important. The methods of the joint exam can be improved, but the system of the joint exam cannot be opposed. The unified exam is the same. Many people often suspect or even oppose the system itself because the methods are not well handled. This is unreasonable. But how many improvements are needed in the methods? This is worthy of our study. Now I will write my personal opinions below for the education community to discuss and refer to.</p>
<p>(1) Discussion of Admission Standards: The standard currently adopted by the unified exam is a single standard. In other words, it is a unified standard. Regardless of whether you apply to any group or any department, as long as the score is above this unified standard, you can be admitted. Its advantage lies in its uniformity. With unified standards, the level of students can be relatively consistent. But from another perspective, universities have different faculties and departments, and the disciplines are different, and the nature is even more different. Taking the College of Science as an example, the students that the Physics Department wants to recruit are slightly different from the Chemistry Department, and even more different from the Geography, Geology, Biology, and Psychology Departments. The Chinese Literature Department of the College of Liberal Arts is slightly different from the History and Sociology Departments, and even more different from the Foreign Literature Department. There are even differences in nature between colleges. Strictly speaking, it is best if each college has different exam subjects, or even each department has different exam subjects. Even if the exam subjects are the same for the same college or colleges of the same nature, the admission standards cannot be completely consistent. The most ideal standard is that each department has a specific standard, or at least each college should have a specific standard. The current method adopted by the unified exam is the grouping method. The exam subjects, Civics, Chinese, Foreign Language, and National History and Geography, are common exam subjects for the three groups. Mathematics is also compulsory for the three groups, but the content of the disciplines and the difficulty of the questions are different. The second group has the highest level, the third group is the second highest, and the fourth group is the lowest. In addition, the first group must test Foreign History and Geography, the second group must test Physics and Chemistry, and the third group must test Biology, or Foreign History and Geography, Physics or Chemistry. However, the first group includes many faculties and departments, such as the faculties of Arts, Law, and Commerce, the departments of Education in the Normal College, and the Department of Railway Management in the College of Engineering. The second group includes the various departments of the College of Engineering, the departments of Mathematics in the College of Science, and the departments of Physics and Chemistry in the Normal College. The third group includes the various departments of the College of Medicine and the College of Agriculture, the departments of Biology in the College of Science, and the Department of Natural History in the Normal College. Although the exam subjects are different for each group, the admission standards are the same for all three groups, which cannot be adapted to the special nature of each faculty and department. If departmental or college standards are adopted, there are actually too many faculties and departments, and the exam subjects are not determined by faculty or department, so there is no need. Moreover, each candidate has three different desired faculties and departments, and college and departmental standards cannot be applied. The best method is to adopt the grouping standard method, because the exam subjects in the same group are the same and are not restricted by the different desired faculties and departments of the candidates. The so-called grouping admission standards are of course different for each group. If there are many candidates in a certain group, exceeding the total capacity of each school, the admission standards can be appropriately raised. Conversely, if there are few candidates in a certain group or the general scores are not very high, the admission standards can be slightly lowered. This not only adapts to supply and demand and reduces the difficulty of distribution, but also adjusts the disparity in the number of students in each discipline. The disciplines are different, the nature is different, and the supply and demand of people are also different. Grouping admission standards can still maintain the standards of the same group, so it does not lose its unified purpose.</p>
<p>(2) Adjustment of the Number of People in Each Discipline: We have already seen the phenomenon of the disparity in the number of students in each discipline in the unified exam. Whether it is the examination application of the candidates or the number of people admitted, they are concentrated in a small number of faculties and departments. Science is the foundation of all sciences, but the number of admissions is particularly small. China is a country based on agriculture, and agricultural production is extremely important during wartime, but only more than 200 agricultural freshmen are admitted. The wartime and peacetime medical and health talents are in urgent need, but only more than 200 medical freshmen are admitted. The faculties of Arts and Law are related to the future of national culture, but because there are few applicants, the number of admissions is also small. Since the number of admissions is small, the result of the distribution is that there is only one or two people in one department, or even none. In order to respect the wishes of the candidates, the unified exam does not want to force those who want to study engineering to study agriculture or medicine, and because the groups are different and the exam subjects are different, it is fundamentally impossible to force them. Therefore, the faculties and departments with too few people have to be left to their own devices. In addition to allowing them to recruit additional students, there is no other way. But this method loses the spirit of unified enrollment. The only way to remedy it is to start by adjusting the number of people in each discipline. The grouping admission standard mentioned in the previous section is a type of adjustment method. The purpose of the unified exam is to coordinate the overall situation. The setting of faculties and departments, the increase or decrease of classes, the amount of academic places, and the distribution of the number of people should be coordinated in advance with a plan, taking into account national needs. If the number of people in a certain subject should be increased, or if a certain number of talents in a certain subject should be created in a few years, the government may set up a certain number of national scholarships for that subject to encourage students to apply. For example, this year there are particularly few students in science, agriculture, and medicine, and next year, more national scholarship places for these subjects can be set up to encourage students to apply enthusiastically. National scholarships should be more generous than general scholarships, and the number of places should be large. On the one hand, excellent students can be absorbed, and on the other hand, the number of people in each discipline can be adjusted according to needs. Otherwise, the disparity in the number of students in each faculty of the university is too large, and the opening of departments and classes is not economical, and talent cultivation lacks planning, which is not a blessing for the future of the country. Therefore, for the sake of the unified exam system itself and for the rationality of educational policy, this plan is indeed necessary to implement.</p>

<p>(Chongqing, 25th dispatch) The Ministry of Education recently ordered the education departments of all provinces and national vocational schools that all vocational schools in all disciplines should add two courses, Geography and History, for one academic year each, with two hours of teaching per week, to be completed in the first and second academic years, so that students have a deeper understanding of the country and the nation, to enhance their patriotism.

<p>The National Peking University Students in Shanghai Association has been preparing and registering members for over a month. More than forty people have requested registration. However, the initiators believe that the number of alumni from various departments scattered in Shanghai should be more, given the university's long history. For the sake of connecting feelings and encouraging studies, it is necessary to expand the recruitment. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 23rd, a gathering dinner was held for all registered students, during which it was decided to continue recruiting members, and Mr. Pan Yongzhao and Ms. Lin Ming were designated to be responsible for all preparatory matters. All new and old students from the five departments of Liberal Arts, Science, Agriculture, Engineering, Medicine, Law, and Business can write to Mr. Pan at No. 5, Lane 3, Ruizhi Lane, Mette Hers Road, or Ms. Lin on the 3rd floor, No. 196, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road, to request registration. The association has also decided to formally establish before February 15, 1940, so unregistered students are expected to register as soon as possible.</p>

Those who pre-purchase six-corner tickets (South Stand) will enter the venue through the large iron gate on Route West Seymour. And the temporary ticket purchase windows have also increased by as many as fifteen, with eight windows selling one yuan and one corner tickets, all on Albert Road, and seven windows selling six-corner tickets, all on West Seymour Road. Today, except for press passes, all other complimentary tickets will be temporarily suspended, even players and referees must hold special complimentary tickets to enter the venue. In order to make the ceremony grand, the organizers specially invited Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, to preside over the opening ceremony, to show solemnity.

<p>The amount of inland rice arriving in Shanghai has remained scarce in recent days, but the supply of foreign rice is continuous. Another batch arrived yesterday, totaling 3,381 bags, transported from Hong Kong by the Taikoo Company's Yuezhou Wheel. It is reported that a larger amount of foreign rice is coming directly from Saigon today. The exact number will be reported after the ship arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trend of foreign sugar was flat and slightly loose. The Association's set price for spot goods was 58 yuan for 24 raw white, 58.5 yuan for new goods at the main warehouse, 58 yuan for old goods, and 48 yuan for re-exported goods. Taikoo Che Bai B Mark was 58 yuan at the desk warehouse, 58.5 yuan at the west warehouse, CW Mark was 58.2 yuan, CX Mark was 57.8 yuan, DY Mark was 57.5 yuan, and HX Mark was 57.3 yuan. There was no change in red sugar and red molasses. Domestic sugar, such as from Chaoshan, has been lacking recent arrivals due to being controlled by a certain party, so Diaoging is quite tight. The Yuezhou Wheel continued to arrive with 986 bags yesterday, and samples may be seen today.</p>

<p>The Indian coal market is calm. The street is holding a wait-and-see attitude, and there is a lack of wholesale transactions. Traders are unwilling to lower prices and sell loosely due to high costs, maintaining the situation. The discounted prices of fellow traders are as follows: Calcutta lump coal is 115 yuan per ton, screened lump is 119 yuan, and bottom screen dust is 98 yuan. Delivery from the same industry's warehouse to the customer's home is subject to additional transportation costs.</p>

<p>The woolen cloth trade was still prosperous yesterday. The standard price remained firm. Various thick goods, such as overcoat woolen cloth, Melton, etc., Hume Four-Ply Harris, cashmere riding breeches, wide and narrow striped plain art camel fleece, and long and short-haired mohair, etc., were all selling well. However, shipments were temporarily suspended due to the Christmas closure. All large and small transactions are now conducted in cash because the end of the Gregorian calendar year has arrived, and most of the woolen cloth companies want to balance their accounts. The market prices are recorded below: Hunter &amp; Son Trademarked Cashmere 13.500 Yulok Mau Yuan Tibetan Melton 6.500 Shun Quanlong Yuan Tibetan Melton 7.000 Bao Da Yuan Tibetan Plain Thick Woolen Cloth 8.600 Hua Bo Yuan Tibetan Thick Plain Woolen Cloth 13.500 Tian Xiang Bald Yuan Plain Thick Woolen Cloth 13.750 Xie Xin Tibetan Qing Valet Woolen Cloth 8.500 Da Long Shadow Grid Serge 5.250 Zheng Lun All Wool Black Charcoal Lining 3.600 Yin Feng First Class French West Lining 0.650</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, the export of Western sea cucumber has gradually decreased, resulting in scarce arrivals. If this continues, it will be exhausted. It is found that the bottom accumulation here has also been gradually sold out. Therefore, the current colored sea cucumbers, such as red ginseng and jade ginseng, have risen by 20% compared to before. Other black yuan square ginsengs have also risen at the same time, and bald ginseng is even more scarce. Large sizes such as top bald and large bald have been out of stock, with only a small amount of medium bald needing to be sold for around 200 yuan, and small bald also sold for 180 yuan. At this time, the destination is flourishing, and the trend is unusually firm.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Removing Barriers <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>I remember a scholar once said in public that there will always be barriers between people. He seemed to be hoping that everyone would sympathize with this barrier. But people seemed to be tired of hearing it and lacked the interest to sympathize. This does not just happen to prove that his views are correct, that is, he and his predecessors' sweeping articles have something in common - it turns out to be just narrating and not creating.</p>
<p>Of course, what he said also has a basis, such as people not being born together, not sharing the same pain or joy, you are you, I am me, laughter and sighs happening at the same time, and so on. However, it is difficult to convince people with only simple physiological reasons. Besides coral, wolves and jackals are no different, as if not only humans are like this.</p>
<p>Barriers do not not exist. At first, it was not like this, but later it was because of "life." The scholar also felt the loneliness and distress, and although his arguments were slightly similar to those of the former sages, most people did not welcome it because of the distance of "life."</p>
<p>Barriers must be removed by life.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a revolutionary who was sentenced to death. Many spectators came when he was executed. The spectators made a commotion, interspersed with sighs and laughter. The revolutionary was full of emotions and could not help but complain, composing a poem: "The torrential rain is east of the great river, the gale enters the sea; life and death are all for you, pity you do not understand!" This is very painful. However, the laughter of the spectators also had differences and should not be completely dismissed. - It is not necessarily understood by experts who study the history of love. The revolutionary's poem is just a kind of emotional self-deprecation. If I am so separated, it will not give a certain terrible impression and there is no danger of being beheaded.</p>
<p>Let life explain this.</p>
<p>Recently, these times and places have been celebrating Christmas very lively. This is because of the greatness of Jesus' personality, "sacrificing oneself, and loving everyone" - there is no barrier at all. Some people express a very harmonious view and will celebrate all night, but there is a limit of fifteen yuan per guest for a large meal, which shows that it is not very "philanthropic". Naturally, it is not easy to be "close" on the street. This has been a long time, but it has become more obvious after August 13. I don’t know how long this "forever" will last.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic people are indignant. It is proposed to prepare to give turkey to people on the street to eat, "share the joy with the people," but probably this generosity is wanted to be expressed at the banquet. After a while, "baked pork fillet with original sauce and roasted potatoes" and "white hat cake" are stuffed in the mouth, and one cannot help but remain silent for three minutes.</p>
<p>Returning to the outside and vomiting out the chicken bones, let the poor children thank them in unison; and on the one hand, mutter and scold "Judas" for being so careless; and make yourself believe that the chicken is really eaten by "Judas".</p>
<p>This is a "charitable" attitude.</p>
<p>If there are barriers, let them be "forever."</p>
<p>Do you want to mock me for holding the attitude of a reformist to speak out righteously? I dare not. To negotiate in between cups and plates, to make parallel talks, and say some seasonal words like "Jesus has his reasons" to save the declining fate of the butcher, this is also worthy of attention. Although there are reasons for its barrier, there are also means to get close and improve it.</p>
<p>Clever "Judas," you just eat your "velvet soup," it is okay to say that it will take three thousand years to remove the barriers between people, but you must first prepare more blood and gunpowder; throwing turkey legs and flirting eyes are in vain. Amen!</p>

<p>— Xu Ye</p>
<p>A round of red sun slipped out of the pine forest, and the mist of the night disappeared without a trace. The wind swept across the river and the sand plain, and the quiet earth awakened in the sun.</p>
<p>A group of people who had just rushed through the night might be a little tired from walking more than a hundred miles. However, they knew that the unfinished road was doubly far, and they had to reach it within three days. The captain often shouted with his broad mouth:</p>
<p>"See who has good courage, we should hurry to the city today!"</p>
<p>Today, the captain especially showed his black eyes and swallowed a bite of steamed bun:</p>
<p>"Return to the team, set off for Sangpu Mountain at 6:10!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the team stirred under the call to assemble.</p>
<p>"Attention--"</p>
<p>The command sounded like thunder, and the team suddenly became silent. The captain looked solemnly at everyone's clothes!</p>
<p>"Whoever speaks will be a turtle!"</p>
<p>A burst of laughter was mixed in the marching steps.</p>
<p>A steel stream under the white sun...</p>
<p>A sandy plain unfolded in front of us. Not far away were the slopes of the mountains. Jagged rocks stood tall. Rows of pine trees surrounded the mountainside. White clouds covered the peaks. . The dust stones resounded with mountain springs, and several goshawks circled in the dense forest.</p>
<p>The endless mountains stretched out of the plain, and the long, winding Rong River followed the end of the mountains and connected to the East China Sea.</p>
<p>"Isn't that the Rong River flowing?"</p>
<p>Turning a mountain path, we jumped out of the pine forest. Looking east, everyone was filled with unexpected joy:</p>
<p>"That river flows from the northwest. It will bring us lovely miracles. Someone said that Han Yu of the Tang Dynasty crossed the river here to go to Beijing..."</p>
<p>"Yes! The fields of tens of millions of residents in Eastern Guangdong all rely on it for irrigation!"</p>
<p>The 14-year-old comrade spoke with force, his face covered in sand and ash, sometimes even spitting saliva on the people in front of him.</p>
<p>Many people were "remembering the past." Someone recited a poem by Han Yu when he was an official in Chaozhou, and then someone sang a folk song to defend their hometown.</p>
<p>"To reach our destination, let's cross another mountain!"</p>
<p>A group of people laughed, and the captain also smiled, his eyes squinting...</p>
<p>Under the mountain, there were hidden green fields, scattered villages, and intermittent cooking smoke, the mountains and rivers of the motherland.</p>
<p>Here, the Rong River suddenly disappeared, and we continued to walk in the direction specified by the captain.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>It seemed like a cannon shot came flying over, and the captain ordered us to stop marching.</p>
<p>"No matter what the cannon sound is, we have to get to the city quickly. If the enemy invades, the headquarters will definitely receive intelligence, and everyone will be mobilized tomorrow... Now, run——"</p>
<p>The iron stream moved quickly again.</p>
<p>Concentrating on the common goal, straw sandals rolled up the sand, and the front and rear were blurred and indistinguishable. A young comrade slipped and rolled over, and the dead leaves on the roadside seemed to dance behind him with the wind, and the goshawks flew out of the treetops, making strange cries.</p>
<p>"Almost there!"</p>
<p>The sun shone in the sky, and dozens of faces exchanged blood and fire...</p>

<p>— Jiang Xi</p>
<p>Have you forgotten? It seems like a distant age: Clear blue skies, covering fragrant earth. Have you forgotten? Those faded dreams: Flowers bathed in sunlight; Children chasing little birds, joyfully leaping. Have you forgotten? That black cloud beyond the sky; That sudden storm; That misfortune of the fields! Have you forgotten? We once soared side by side; The storm shattered my wings, and I fell in a distant, foreign land! Look: The clear sky is filled with thick clouds, The fertile land has turned to sand and gravel, Torrents flood the fields. Only withered leaves remain of the flowers, Darkness has replaced the sunlight, Children lie sleeping in ditches! The storm rages on unabated; The light is deeply buried; Ghosts roam the earth! The old nest has frozen into an icy cave under the storm. My companion! Will the cold damage your bones? My companion! Have you seen the clear sky after the storm, The warmth of spring after the harsh winter, The morning breeze after the dark night? My companion! I wish you -- do not forget your</p>
<p>old companion, the blue sky, the sunlight, prepare a welcome for their return!</p>

<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>The mercury in the thermometer has dropped quite a bit, and the coughing has increased accordingly. The wind is blowing hard outside, and although there is still good sunlight, it never shines into the room.</p>
<p>In the cold house, the ancient clock ticks with a cold sigh; I see a hungry tiger invade my heart, biting me, biting my heart, and with it I remember many things.</p>
<p>Facing the old clock, I smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>The clock was passed down from my grandfather to my father, and from my father to me, and now it looks so old and lonely.</p>
<p>All day and all night it tells its life story, and afterwards it complains, pouting its lips and saying, "Now, look at how useless you are, look at how useless you are!"</p>
<p>Every time it chants its coarse, slow, and hoarse song, I glare at it fiercely. I feel that it is gnawing away at my life, urging me to get closer and closer to death.</p>
<p>I remember that night last year, how I struggled to carry it with me as I fled...</p>
<p>I also remember ten years ago, my father, with his dull hands and eyes, pointing to the old clock, looking at his children...</p>
<p>Restlessly, I paced around the room, and when I faced the clock, I was so frightened that I almost cried out: I saw my father's face, my grandfather's face, so stern, so angry!</p>
<p>Then the clock tells its grievance, it scolds me for not staying here, it says it should not be placed on this humble, dirty broken table, and finally, it roars: "You are not your father's son, you are not your grandfather's grandson!"</p>
<p>I covered up its curses with a cough, and turned my head away, towards the outside, towards the window; I saw the sunlight, the sunlight that had never shone into my room!</p>
<p>"Be a migratory bird," I stretched my body, packed my simple luggage, and carried the clock handed down from my ancestors.</p>
<p>Truly, tomorrow, I can't stand the cold anymore and I'm going to move again.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Thoughts Inspired by My Daughter's Reading – The Soviet Children's Theatre (Part 2) <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>Puppet shows, also known as wooden figure shows, are now rarely seen.</p>
<p>They can still be found occasionally in rural areas.) "Puppet" is also written as "窟　". According to "Chicken Ribs" it is said: "窟　子 is also called 魁　子, making dolls to play, sing and dance, originally music for funerals. At the end of the Han Dynasty, it began to be used in festive gatherings. The Later Lord of Qi, Gao Wei, especially liked it, and Korea also had it. Now the word is written as 傀儡. "Fuweng's Miscellaneous Sayings" states: It resembles the ancient hero Kui Lei, hence the name." After reading this explanation, we know that puppet shows were originally funeral music, which, like the military bands at large funerals and the boys wearing white embroidered costumes and playing wind instruments, commonly known as "Little Ten Varieties," contains the meaning of finding joy in suffering.</p>
<p>As for the style of puppet shows, this illustrated magazine explains it very clearly! "Puppet shows imitate Chen Ping. Later generations followed his intention, creating various dramas that are quite pleasing to the eye! The large ones are moved by strings, called string puppet shows. In Shanghai today, the wooden figures are seven or eight inches tall, either slipped onto the fingers or operated with wooden mechanisms, and are collectively called wooden figure shows."</p>
<p>His so-called "imitating Chen Ping" is based on "Records of the Music Bureau": "Emperor Gaozu of Han" was surrounded by "Mao Dun" in Pingcheng. One side of the city was occupied by "Mao Dun's" wife, "Yan Shi," whose army was stronger than the other three sides. The fortress was cut off from food. "Chen Ping inquired and learned that 'Min Shi' was jealous, so he created wooden puppets and used mechanisms to dance in the battle formation. 'Lan Shi' worried that if they took the city, 'Mao Dun' would definitely take in prostitutes, so he withdrew his troops. Later musicians turned it into a theatrical prop, which is the puppet." If this section is correct, then the origin of puppet shows was in the besieged city during a famine, which is certainly an ominous thing! Moreover, the one offended by the puppet was the jealous "Yan Shi" lady, no wonder women and children like to watch puppet shows.</p>
<p>Every city and factory area in the Soviet Union has a children's theatre. Larger cities have as many as five or six. There are many types of plays performed. There are spoken dramas, operas, and dances, most of which are performed by children. The one we visited was a children's theatre in Leningrad that specializes in puppet shows. Their performance method is the same as our string puppet shows. However, "small as the sparrow is, it has all its vital organs." Regarding the script, set design, lighting, music, and the puppets' movements, costumes, etc., all the necessary conditions for the stage have been meticulously researched, handled with utmost care, and not neglected due to their small size, which is truly worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>The play performed that day was called "The Land of the Lazy." As the name suggests, it is a drama teaching people to "hate laziness and value diligence." The story is very simple, depicting a "non-worker's" indulgence in idleness and comfort, which leads to many evils and ultimately destroys himself. Another worker, through hardship and hard work, diligent struggle, achieves final glorious success. The characters' ages and environments are mostly based on children's lives, and common sense is infused into the structure of the play. For example, in the scene of traveling around the world, the Indian snake charmers, the Spanish bullfights, all enable children to gain a lot of common knowledge while being interested. In that scene, the depiction of our country is still quite polite, with only one playful child making many outrageous jokes in his wandering life!</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e86">Riding the Winds and Waves <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Watt saw the water boiling in the pot and invented the steam engine. Newton saw the apple falling to the ground and proved the theory of gravity. However, during their invention and confirmation process, they were met with ridicule from the short-sighted. These stories read in elementary school textbooks are facts known to everyone. American films have recently been competing to shoot this type of film, such as "The Struggle History of Bell, the Inventor of the Telephone," and the completion of great projects, such as "Iron Horse," which connected the western railways. Bringing these stories to the screen not only allows the older generation to know the hardships of the early pioneers but also encourages us to continue this spirit and achieve further discoveries.</p>
<p>"Riding the Winds and Waves" tells the story of the transformation from sailing ships to steam engines. David Greig and his partner John went through many twists and turns, faced ridicule, struggled hard, and finally completed the pioneering feat of crossing the Atlantic from London to New York.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd is the director of "Mutiny on the Bounty," but his handling of "Riding the Winds and Waves" is obviously not as good as the former. First, he wrote about David and John's struggles in a flat and trivial way, without grasping a key highlight to emphasize it, so that the joy of the engine ship's first voyage could not reach an exceptionally lively and joyful state. Second, when the new ship encountered danger, he only strengthened the romance between David and Mary in the midst of a crisis. This leisurely handling method destroyed the final climax; moreover, the weaving of the scenes was not clear and concise enough, such as the old man's injury and the passengers' panic, which were not quickly glossed over, and David's desperate repair work was not described with sufficient effort. Thus, in the shot of David putting down the stone-like object and sitting down after the ship sailed, there was no sense of strength at all.</p>
<p>Van Heflin's acting is very calm, but because of the above-mentioned reasons, he did not have the opportunity to concentrate on acting. John Beal of Wilshire Ave did a very good job.</p>
<h3 id="e87">"The Assassin" Sketches <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The new Yi Hua film "The Assassin" has a loyal and tragic plot that can inspire people. Wang Yuanlong plays Jing Ke, and his performance of sacrificing himself for the country is very moving. At this time, this film will surely bring tears to the audience's eyes. This film has a great message, and we should not take it lightly.</p>
<p>In the picture, King of Qin (played by Zheng Zhong) rejoices greatly when Wang Jian's victory over Zhao is reported to Qin. The next day, he sets out to Handan, furious at the rudeness of the people of Zhao and slaughtering them cruelly! He then deposes the King of Zhao and imprisons him in a stone house in Fangling, and grants a title to Zhao official Guo Kai. The King of Zhao realizes Guo's true nature, but it is too late. The lower picture shows Hu Ji (played by Zi Wei). In the harem of the King of Zhao, there is a Hu Ji, the king's most beloved concubine, who can sing and dance. She wants the King of Zhao to leave Fangling, but is blocked by Guo Kai, so she is placed in the back garden to be offered to the King of Qin. The King is pleased by Hu's appearance and takes her. Although Hu misses her former master, she can do nothing for the time being.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Several Banker Enthusiasts</p>
<p>Mr. Ziheng and Boss Cheng are close friends. He obtains many of Cheng's tunes, and his natural good voice is comparable to Wang (Guifen) and Sun Juxian. Chang Shengsun was over eighty years old when he learned opera from him. Before the tenth year of the Republic, Shengsun also advertised himself as a Cheng School performer in old Beijing. At that time, he was only a young man, so the opera fans all ridiculed him as crazy, because his age was very far from Cheng's. He was innovating, which was self-deception. Although he had performed several times, the result was still a failure, and he disappeared into obscurity. When Shengsun was advertising himself as a Cheng School performer, Shuyan was working hard to learn Tan. Wang, Tan, and Sun were all disciples of Boss Cheng, so Shengsun, who was even more arrogant than Shuyan, not only looked down on his elder brother, but even ridiculed Lao Tan as a soft and decadent sound, not enough to compete with his Cheng School. After Shuyan became famous, he thought that no one in the current opera world could be on par with him. For example, when the record company asked Lanfang to record, the price was only 1,500 yuan per record, but Shuyan would not do it for less than 3,000 yuan per record. It would cost 50,000 yuan per month to hire Mei to perform together, but Shuyan would still be afraid that 100,000 yuan would not be enough. He always valued himself highly and looked down on everything—but in the end, he was despised by his younger brother, which was also very unexpected.</p>
<p>The banker mentioned above who was infatuated with beauty, this actress is indeed very beautiful. Her name cannot be announced. She was originally from Beili, and later invited Xu Lanyuan to teach her Mei School operas, and Xu arranged a troupe for her. All the supporting actors, such as Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua, and the martial arts staff, were all from the Mei Opera Troupe. They performed at the Zhonghe Garden. I have seen several of her performances, and they were not bad at all. Every time she performed, a certain banker would always book many seats to support her. Her residence was in the middle of Mishihutong, Xuanwai, and the banker's car was always parked in front of her door. (166)</p>

<p>— Jiang</p>
<p>A reporter from the American film magazine "Movie Mirror" held an interesting test at Warner Bros. The topic was: "Do I love a man who is handsome, rich, sociable, skillful, knowledgeable, cautious, or a great lover?" The subjects of this test were, of course, female stars.</p>
<p>The test was done by voting. The voters that day included new Best Actress Bette Davis, Olivia de Havilland, Zolina, Jane Wyman, and 18 famous stars such as Anne Shirley Dan.</p>
<p>The result was that skillful men received the most votes, a total of ten. Handsome men were the second most numerous, with five votes. As for cautious men, they were unfortunately not consulted by anyone.</p>
