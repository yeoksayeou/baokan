<p>社評</p>
<h3>綸昌事件</h3>
<p>浦東英商綸昌紡織廠的工潮，遷延兩旬，至今還沒有解決的消息。日來綸昌廠正在各報登廣告，找尋工人推派代表前往談判，我們很希望識事明理的綸昌工友，能夠立即推派代表去磋商，同時更希望綸昌當局亦能盡量接受工人的要求，以共謀這决糾紛的合理解決。吾則，工潮長此遷延，勞資雙方都蒙受莫大的損失，恰被播弄是非的竊笑。我們知道該廠本已宣佈於前月二十九日開工，而工人亦多已準備進廠，不料事前竟有所謂「罷工委員會」分頭攔阻，對進廠復工者施以恐嚇，致仍無法開工。在目前，勞資兩方之間，已顯然爲魔手重重隔開，資方要找工人代表謀面談判而不得，這種毒辣的陰謀，該爲綸昌勞資雙方所痛切認識而猛省吧。</p>
<p>據報載，這次綸昌二千工人罷工的近因，是由於該廠的白俄司閽虐待女工，有男工目見不平，出而爭論，卒爲廠方所開除，因而羣情憤慨，相率罷工。但遠因則聽說還是因爲廠方減削獎金，引起工人的反對。原來最近百物昂貴，工人實際工資的下降，達百分之五十，工人的生活本已感着不勝負荷之苦，今又因獎金被減削，遂愈益加深了普遍的不滿。當糾紛發生之初，據說工人頗能顧全大局，曾推派代表與廠方交涉，但廠方竟加拒絕，這時候，混入廠內的搗亂份子便乘機煽動，造成全廠的一片混亂，廠方遂不得不宣布停工。</p>
<p>自有「幸災樂禍」的人，却就抓住了這個機會，大吹大擂的煽起反英運動。一面組織所謂「罷工委員會」，隔絕勞資雙方的接觸；一面却又設法收買，甘言蜜餌，雙管齊下，所幸工人大都深明大義，不願領此賣身錢，充人家的吶喊工具。現在大部份的工人已覺悟不願把事情擴大，廠方亦切望與勞方磋商解決，但由於魔手的從中梗塞阻撓，所以綸昌工廠到今天還沒有復工的可能。</p>
<p>綸昌事件桌子初不過是一個局部的問題，爾後演變，遂別有重大意義了。老實說，上海整個的工商業，是各國共通的利益所繫，而爲企圖獨佔上海市塲者的眼中釘。對於英商如此，對於別國商人亦如此。他們的策略是一面利用叛徒份子混到企業內部去搗亂，一面郤又借着「保護工人利益」的幌子，煽惑罷工，造成停廠失業的結果。這樣一來，他們便可以從中圖利，旣奪到了市塲，又可以取得與市塲同樣需要的勞動力。在這决綸昌事件中，人人可以看得明了。因此，今後上海的勞資雙方，都應該怎樣勞力來完成他們的切實合作，覺悟勞資不是對立的。</p>
<p>自從抗戰以來，上海的職工確乎表現了空前的自覺精神。他們在物價高漲，工資下跌的惡劣生活條件下，能夠顧全大局，忍受一切，這種精神確乎値得我們的欽佩。上海的資方固然有一部份也已與勞方做到初步的合作，但大部份郤還不免與勞方有着很大的隔閡，不肯接受勞方合理的要求，不肯改善勞工的生活。譬如這决的綸昌事件也許正是這種隔閡所造成，據聞綸昌工廠在開工時每天可以贏餘萬元以上，停工後每天須虧損二萬元，爲挽回每天三萬元以上的損失，綸昌當局即對勞方讓步些兒也還値得。所以，今後上海的資方，應該盡量顧及勞工的生活，維持勞資融洽的合作，在今天，也等於是維護自己本身的利益。</p>
<p>至於勞方，此後亦自應格外認淸大勢，不要弄錯目前的對象。更宜加强自身的組織，以免得叛徒份子乘機混入搗亂煽惑。要知道民族危機迫切的今天，階級意識應該全部放棄了。</p>

<p>（倫敦）下議院定於明日復會、議事日程列有德國要求提取捷克國存在倫敦之黃金一項問題　即當提付討論、政界人士茲就本問題紛紛研究、據金融界負責人士所知、捷克　存金共有兩批、第一批爲五百萬鎊、乃係捷克國家銀行所有、前於三月杪由國際淸債銀行出面存放倫敦、業已交由捷克國家銀行害藏於布拉格城、旋即落於德國掌握、第二批爲六百五十萬鎊、乃係捷克國家銀行直接存放倫敦、由英國政府根　國會所通過之法律、予以扣押。德國所要索者、即爲此一批、英德兩國代表團業已一度進行談判、但無成議英國方面所提出之論據、乃謂捷克國家銀行旣爲捷克國之直接承繼人、其所存放之黃金、自應用以抵償夾國在該國境內所保有之債權、並以爲如此說法、可以避免涉及波希米亞摩拉維亞保護制度之承認問題此在德國方面、則謂捷克國家銀行具有獨立性質、倘用該銀行存款抵付前　捷克國之債務　即係非法舉動、雙方各執一辭、未能成立妥協、按弟一批黃金交予捷克國家銀行之時、下議院多數議員　然反對、茲若交出第二批黃金、則反對情况自必愈益劇烈、或足以妨害政府地位、由此觀之英德兩國未必能賡續進行談判云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日軍侵略下　華北形成兩種區域　中日兩軍各有控制範圍　但日軍極難肅清遊擊隊　廣大平原為遊擊隊扼守</h3>
<p>字林報五月十五日北平通訊云、中國城鎭中之許多人民、其眞正之家宅與家屬、均在內地村落中者、今必已與其家屬失却往來矣、蓋華北已判然劃分兩種區域、其間確然絕無何種交通、一方面爲日軍侵佔之各城鎭及四週毘連之小片鄕郊、狹隘之鐵路互相聯接、另一方面爲內地之廣大區域、大部份未遭侵略者之蹂躪、而仍處華方管轄下、今欲赴內地者、日當局對之、輙爲不喜、且成行亦匪易、因兩區之間、中輒隔以「無人地」、速綿不斷者、恒爲被焚或摧毀之村落、不受燮方的束之游擊隊逗留其間、故內地各區之情况、今殊難探悉、僅偶晤卜居內地之若干傳敎士、或設法潛返被侵佔區之少數華人智識份子、乃得略悉內地情况之一二、茲將華北（黃河東北）中日雙方控制區之現狀、概述如决、</p>
<p>（一）內蒙　多少在日軍控制下、但日方未圖適當駐守之、</p>
<p>（二）綏遠　鐵路、及沿路之城鎭、與狹長地帶、均在日軍之手、但鐵路錢以南之鄉間、與該綫終站包頭以西之廣大區域、仍由華軍扼守、</p>
<p>（三）察哈爾　長城外北區與沿平張鐵路之狹畏地帶、在日軍控制下、</p>
<p>（四）山西　經三度長久之竭力排逐游擊隊、今中部高原、太原西部與南部、以及沿狹軌的同蒲鐵路、直至黃河之狹長地帶止、均在日軍之手、該省其餘部份、則仍在華軍控制中、</p>
<p>（五）河北　東部、（即所謂冀東者）、北寗鐵路與長城之間、尙稱寗靜、（當憶一九三七年七月之前、此區已在日軍之手矣、）中部、日軍揚言遠至黃河之半途、巳「肅淸」游擊隊、</p>
<p>（六）山東　連接兩鐵路之區域、以及黃河以北、尙稱寗靜、但該省中部多山區與海岬區、仍在華軍之手、甚至沿鐵路一帶、駐有日軍處、常呈不一穩、許多重要鐵路綫、則去安謐尙遠、而深入內地之鐵路綫、僅能供軍用、</p>
<p>鐵路綫與礦區</p>
<p>平漢綫迭　襲擊破壞、張家口與綏遠間之平綏路亦然、平綏路綫破壞至甚、火車不通行者、已數星期矣、晋北平綏路之大同煤礦、近數週來、已被破壞、而不能工作、距北平不遠西山之坨里煤礦亦然、破壞火車、迭有所聞、致火車已有缺少之感、甚至不敷應付此等區域中大减之載客運貨　務、日方處此情勢中、難怪其侵佔華北、幾及兩載、仍不能進行經濟發展也、</p>
<p>最大獨立區</p>
<p>華方最大之獨立區、在平漢路西廣大之多山區中、含有晋綏·察·冀。諸省各一部份、成一堅强之區、人口一千四百萬、該區曾一度包含整個冀中在內、一九三七年日軍進侵之初、地方政府大多摧毀、日軍退回或經過後之一時期中、行政入於完全混亂狀態中、一九三八年初、未受日軍直接侵佔之各區代表、在保定以西鄰近晋邊之小城阜平舉行會議、組織所謂區政府者、接掌仍能獨立區域之行政權、此乃一種流動之政府、循適於應付日軍時常出擊之方針而辦事、的歷半載、該政府得閒鞏固其本身地位、且使各縣陸續恢復秩序、去歲十一月、日方大批援軍抵華北、自東與四、即目平漢路與津浦路大舉進犯俾肅淸冀中、迭次作戰、的五閱月、日軍損失綦重、始得侵佔黃河南岸將及半途之各城鎭、旋因發現其進犯後復退却之制度、、未得滿意之結果、乃決更變方法、而開始駐守冀中更大之城鎮、職是之故、三四月問續有援兵的五萬名開抵華北、遽即湧入廣大之區域、然地廣兵少、仍感不敷分配、故雖增援、仍不能謂爲已對冀中作有效　侵佔、游擊隊現仍扼守四鄕、藏身於廣大平原上如星羅棋布之千百村落中、因游擊隊於離去前、已將多數城鎮之城垣拆毀、故日軍只得守於有刺鐵絲網障碍物後、且呈不穩之象、而於四週區域中、並無勢力之可言、日軍縱巳侵佔一城、對於「綏靖」鄉郊、毫無把握、蓋物色其人、進行當地任何種行政者、困難日甚也、當日軍迫近一城時、人民奉令離城、僅地痞之流留居、任事於日軍指使之下、實屬一種險艱工作、因遭游擊隊捕獲、即加槍決也、四週區域內之農民、不復携農產入實巳荒蕪之城市、故日軍不得不用卡車自最近火車站運輸一切給養、游擊隊在汽車路上橫掘深六尺之塹溝、致卡車運輸、大受阻碍、著名原棉供給、爲日軍進犯華北目的之一、亦成幻想、蓋游擊隊已勸農民勿再植棉、致其產額、聞已减少什八、按據目前方針、日軍今後奚能希望樹立奏效之行政機關、在華北全區辦事、並恢復內地之和平與秩序、殊難明瞭、日軍此前所採取、現仍繼續採取在內地其他部份進襲、摧毀村落、而歸咎於游擊隊之舉動、僅能增加混亂、迫使更多之人加入該隊、且使日軍之給養與交通、大增困難耳、最近駐守內地一切侵佔城鎭之計劃、苟能適當駐守、其結果或能較有效果、但軍力不足而出此、實較無用允爲惡劣、無論如何、廣博之多山區、日軍仍未能侵佔之、若干專家認爲日軍須至少復調五十萬人、可始肅淸華北、然日軍似不願出此、故日軍何日與如何能吿竣是項工作、殊難逆料也事竣後仍回日艦</p>
<h3>岱山日兵　赴長塗島搜索　事竣後仍回日艦</h3>
<p>定海通訊、縣屬長塗島、位子岱山之東、曾於去年一月　、遭日兵登岸、至三月問始行撤退、上月二十二日日軍在岱山登陸後、日艦亦時來長塗窺探、二十七日上午九時許、復有岱山方面駛來日艦二艘、放下汽艇叫隻、載日兵八十餘名、在倭井頭定海灣一帶蜂湧登岸、又有日兵四十餘名、在娘基宮生豆山正乙廟登岸、先後在上下街一帶、搜索村莊、至晚始撒退回艦、</p>
<h3>日軍中將司令官　岩松被華軍擊傷　岩松赴揚途中遇刺　彈中胸部傷勢甚重</h3>
<p>泰縣通信、日軍中將司令官岩松、於五月二十五日赴揚州視察在瓜洲下輪渡時、被華方便衣游擊隊士、以手槍擊中胸部、傷勢甚重、當乘專輪送滬醫治、該游擊隊士、則於任務完成後、安然而退、</p>
<h3>日軍窮蹩中　蘇北華軍聲勢浩大　于顧各部共二十萬衆　對徐州已經成包圍形勢　日軍示威原是紙老虎</h3>
<p>興化通信、蘇北華軍、現在共有二十餘萬之衆、其中三分之一是于學忠所部的燕趙勇士、分佈在蘇魯邊境的邳·沛·豐·碭。蕭·灌雲·宿遷·等縣、對徐州成爲一大包圍的形勢、三分之一、是顧祝同部的軍隊、也就是蘇魯邊區司令和江蘇省省保安處的基本部隊、客籍的和土籍的各半、因爲顧氏要職太多所以這方面的實際負責指揮人、是代理江蘇省府主席韓德勤、它底分佈區域、是阜寗。淮安。鹽城。興化·東台·高郵·泰縣·泰興等縣、及揚·如·通·海·崇·靖·各縣的四鄕、其餘的三分之一、則完全是各縣的土著壯丁隊、武器組織雖然不及正規軍、可是他們愛護鄉土的情緖、極爲高漲、但他們太缺乏政治訓練、所以這一支眞正的民衆武力、並不能充分發揮它底效能、這是一件很可惜的事、</p>
<p>因爲有這二十多萬大軍的保衛蘇北、使日方的略奪資物、不能像蘇。錫各縣城境內的爲所欲爲、相反地、在日軍所能够佔據的徐州·揚州·通州·靖江·等縣的縣境中、非但不敢越出城池一步、而且像朝不保夕」一樣的驚慌着、牠們每日從上午七時至下午四時、絕對沒有休息的機會、也許因爲牠們人數自感單薄的原故、牠們奉着躱在地窖中的上官命令、每天都是毫無聊賴地在大街上跑着、據說、這是表示牠們的力量、並不單薄的意思、其實因爲兵力單薄、所以在過去每次行軍的隊伍中。都夾著很多的油布抱著的「大砲」和累百累千的「彈箱」、像煞是「械夥彈足」可視現在這些「紙老虎」、都給戮穿了、這是四月中旬的事、當日軍正在耀武揚威的時候、華軍以迅雷不及掩耳的突擊戰術、把牠們衝殺得七零八落、四散逃竄遺留下的、除有一部份可用的輜重外、所謂「大砲」、原來都是展覽會裹的模型木「砲」、箱子裏面所裝着的、都是些敗瓦亂磚、於此可見、日軍的窘途末路了、</p>
<h3>洞庭山枇杷　捐稅苛刻交易困難　交通阻塞無法運出</h3>
<p>蘇州通訊、縣屬洞庭東西兩山、因土質適宜種植果木、故每年果品之出產額、爲數甚多、兩山人民、大半依此收入爲生、其中枇杷一類、允以白沙爲最佳、今歲兩山枇杷、藉氣候溫和、雨水調勻、滿樹黃金、結實甚豐、農民採摘之後、裝運赴城、設法轉輸各地傾銷、滿擬將收穫之餘、以補前年遭日機轟炸之損失、但事與願違、卒因僞縣署捐稅之苛刻、價値大爲抬高、致一般買主、交易困難、又因四處交通阻塞、無法運出應市故大批枇杷船隻、至今猶擱置本邑胥門外水碼頭、而兩山農民、因僞縣署重稅留難、正焦急萬分、</p>
<h3>謀福輪船　被日艦盤查　在鎮海口外</h3>
<p>髯波通訊、德商　和洋行謀福輪、上月二十七日由滬開甬、啟椗時、被江海關日籍關員及日水上巡緝員、登輪檢查、無微不至、歷時甚久、方始放行，二十八日下午四時許駛抵鎭海口外七里嶼附近洋面、又遭遇日艦一艘、以燈語勒令該輪停駛候查、嗣即派水兵五名、登輪再度搜查、盤詰甚詳、因該輪係屬德籍、且僅裝少數之賑糧、未搭附旅客、日兵無可留　乃退回檻、</p>
<h3>蘇錫各縣　春繭行開秤　僞方禁阻轉售洋商</h3>
<p>無錫通訊、蘇錫澄武各縣繭行、巳大部開秤、今歲鄕間育戶甚多、天時又好、蠶兒發育甚佳、惜被葉貴影響，有食葉不足、或傾棄田野者、繭價最高八十元、蘇州繭貨、以光福最佳决爲東西洞庭山、吳縣繭商、認繭價太高、曾推徐浩然等爲代表、向僞方再求减低、而僞方以絲價飛漲、繭商以利之所趨、向內地收繭、須遵照伊規定、必需限於紡繅作自用絲者、否則一槪禁止向繭行雇託收買、如果以後售與洋商、須停止其營業、雖然在鄕鎭游擊區內繭商收貨、幷無問題、而出運經過日僞勢力港口城市、即生阻礙、考偽方禁止原因、目的在增其收入、現繭商方面、正籌措對付方法、若以成本計算、獎來絲價必貴、綢貨原料所增、漲價亦在意中也、</p>
<h3>馮登高之光榮戰績</h3>
<p>騎兵某師、在綏遠從事游擊戰、淸水河下城灣一役、上等兵馮登高一人、抵拒日軍、造成光榮戰績、其經過如下、上月二十七日、某師在淸水河香樹壩與日軍激戰、某團通信排上等兵馮登高奉命退後、二十八日下午、至河畔下城灣村休息時、發現日騎東犯、全村村民四散、馮獨在村、瞄準射擊日騎兵六名、被射殺三名、日大部二三百名正在距下城灣四五里之台兒梁、前哨受阻、即分據山頭、以機槍小鋼砲紛向下城灣射擊馮亦不斷還擊、幷變更方向、眩惑日人、薄慕日軍知下城灣無大兵力、遂向村中包圍、適有綏抗日自衛軍某團赶到援應、日軍始退去、此役馮以一人擊殺日軍數名、使日軍消耗大量彈藥、馮本人苦戰一日、僅褲腿被彈射穿兩孔而已、按馮爲魯之范縣人、年二十六歲、</p>

<h3>吳淞附近　遊擊隊活躍　吳淞日軍開炮猛轟　歷時凡廿分鐘之久　怡和輪遭槍擊說不准</h3>
<p>大陸報云、頃悉、咋日（四日）午前十時至中午、吳淞日陸軍部隊開砲猛轟、砲火顯向吳淞以西的九哩之小村浦西園（譯音）方面射擊、昨日午後、怡和公司之義和號輪自啟東駛返此間後、已證實有此砲火聲、據義和輪若干輪員聲稱、咋晨</p>
<p>十時甫過</p>
<p>該輪泊吳淞外本埠怡和公司發出停泊何處碼頭之通知、的歷二十分鐘、其問曾淸晰聞得沉重砲聲十二至十五發、顯係瞄準浦西園方面而發云、本埠觀察家均堅信浦西園及其近郊有實力勁强之華方游擊隊、邇來</p>
<p>進襲日軍</p>
<p>頗爲混躍、前被日軍奪獲之中國兵艦數艘、由日方艦員駕駛、咋泊啟柬、原因不明、致使啟東人民稍起驚惶、故咋臼來滬貨客爲數較少、星期六日夜此間接訊、謂怡和輪被日軍或華方</p>
<p>開槍射擊</p>
<p>云云、咋由該輪輪員加以吾認、衆信因義和輪在吳淞砲擊地點附近、且聞該區一度不甚寗靜、致起義和輪被射擊之說、叉據</p>
<p>另一報告</p>
<p>吳淞自淪陷以後、日軍擬佔作軍隊休養根據地、因此砲台灣張華浜及同濟學校等處、造有木板營房頗多、戰事開始以後、淞鎮常有臼軍一二萬或數千以上、留居各營房內、自去年以來、居淞軍隊、逐漸减少、營房太半空關、近來則更少、除少數常駐在淞之田中友工程隊、最初有五百、現祇二百名、暨憲兵隊外、其他日軍、則均</p>
<p>被調一空</p>
<p>據淞人云、若輩時來時往、出入頗繁、但現在凡由前綫調淞休養者、至多不過一星期之逗遛、即須他調、故淞鎮時有脫空之日、察其調動繁忙情形而論、足見彼國內確實無兵可調、而在華日軍、則須東增西援、巳</p>
<p>疲於奔命</p>
<p>矣、吳淞駐軍旣若是之空虛、而在淞之少數工程隊憲兵隊、均時露恐惶不安之狀態、上月二十八夜、偽班長曹錦華被淞西游擊隊綑縛去後、日軍遂大起恐惶、除特別戒嚴外、淞滬火車祇開抵高境廟止、不再往北、淞地居民、因之驚疑迭起、</p>
<h3>溫州口時有砲戰　形勢仍緊　外省客商辦貨當地貨款兩交</h3>
<p>溫州口外之峙頭防地、於上月二十九·三十·兩日、均被日艦開砲轟擊、三十一日樂淸防區、亦被砲擊、駐軍當予還擊、故激戰頗爲劇烈、且本月一日起、日艦雖離開溫州海面、惟當地情形仍緊、駐軍特戲爲戒備、溫州縣政府以鑒於日機日艦之不斷騷擾、故經集議、澈底疏散人口及貨物辦法、計一、關於人口方面、除壯丁外、老弱一律疏退、二、溫屬各學校、均暫遷鄉聞、三、貨物方面、各商家大都均已疏散鄉間、如有外省客商、來溫辦貨、決採當地貨款兩交辦法、</p>

<h3>綸昌工潮　亟謀解決　資方對工友表同情　但偽組織活動甚力</h3>
<p>浦東陸家嘴英商綸昌紡織廠罷工風潮、勞資雙方相持將近兩旬、資方因對此决工友、在浦東環境之遭遇、深表同情、故通告各工友、推舉代表、於咋日（五日）上午九時、赴四川路總公司事務所面洽、並表示如提出合理要求、當予同情考慮、但據咋日探查、浦東所組之偽中華民國工人同盟會」中一般活動份子、對此决工潮、霸持甚烈、工人方面受到種種恫嚇、未敢公然集合推舉代表赴公司談判、故勞資雙方尚無謀面機會、但最近期間或可有辦法云、、</p>

<h3>日阻撓外輪結關　各國正謀應付　萬通輪變更地名出口牛莊輪亦已改駛華北</h3>
<p>前江海關日籍稅務司通告於六月一日起、凡江海口岸九處行駛之船隻、須事前先得日海陸軍准許、發給許可證、結關時、再將結關申請書及日方之許可證、交額外稅務司核准、方可結關行駛、因之上星期六、英商太古公司形勢海門啟東綫之萬通輪、未備上項手續、致遭</p>
<p>拒絕結關</p>
<p>等情、已誌前報、該公司雖已呈報英總領事署請求交涉、但是日適爲週六、下午循例休息萬通輪以照規定船期、前日（四日）晨應出口、因不准結關、祇得暫仃停航、以待解決、昨日爲星期一、英領署方面、仍無消息該公司爲船期關係、不能久輟、叉爲</p>
<p>免受損失</p>
<p>起見、昨日亦變更地名以靑龍港·三和港·等名稱結關、乃得准許、該輸定今晨六時復航叉該公司之牛莊輪原定今午出口赴廈門、兼灣興化。泉州、因興·泉·二地亦在禁止之列、結關時恐復遭拒絕、遂</p>
<p>更變航綫</p>
<p>改定八日開往靑島，天津、又據航商云、行駛新港（屬靖江）·新生港（屬通州）·及張家港·坭坨港·東界港等之船隻、雖備有許可證、在起卸貨物時、仍時遭阻撓、以致航業前途、非常悲觀、惟北沙略較優待、因日軍佔領之口岸較少、聞張家港之日軍、於前日忽然自動撒退、其原因不明、</p>
<p>各國交涉</p>
<p>自江海關日籍稅務司小山晃一擅發通告、阻撓外輪結關、所引起之事件、英美法三國當局、對此非常注視、決將採取聯合行動、以維持通商條的及海關之行政主權、除駐滬英總領費利溥連日向海關稅務司羅福德會商制止日籍稅務司之非法行動外、美國駐滬領署方面、亦派員向海關調查眞相、法領署方面對此案亦將抱同樣態度、但德意兩國當局、迄仍觀望、未有若何表示、是吾受有日方優惠之默契、當視今後之態度趨向如何、郎可論斷耳、</p>

<h3>獻給失戀男女與失和夫婦們</h3>
<p>愛情：有人說是謎，有人說是力，更有假道學先生說是罪惡，究竟是什麼呢？我想在每個男女們的心中，一定都很明白。我們一個人的生活，根據斯賓賓氏的分析，不外為經濟生活與兩性生活為主要。至於社交的道德的生活屬於其次。所謂「飽暖思淫慾」　「與倉庫足而後知榮辱」，這都是根據事實所發的確論。我們率直言之，愛情是基於兩性生活的需要而產生的。兩性是天賦的本能，與生俱來，成年而充分發揮其作用。在生理上的研究，就是在我們體內，有一種專司生殖的器官。其主要部分即為生殖腺。此種器官，在幼年時係主持身體狀貌及重量的發育，成年後即專司生殖的工作。所以此種腺體如果健全，那身材自然魁梧，智惡自然靈敏。頭服清淅，精力豐足。這不特為女性所歡迎，在情場上可以左右逢源，必能選擇最滿意的伴侶。就是結婚以後，夫婦愛情繾綣，生男育女，家庭必然美滿。要是青年不知自愛，犯有自瀆遺精，或早婚縱慾，或涉足花柳場中荒淫無度，把生殖機能斵傷了。也有因遺傳關係，或病後失調，使生殖機能萎弱不振者。那凡滑精漏精，早洩陽萎、發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症象，即在所難免。誠如這樣的男子，旣因體貌不揚，每為異性所棄，失戀痛苦，罪由自取，何以嚴責對方！就是結婚以後，夫婦生活亦不能美滿，致養成閰威或夫婦失和，家庭演出悲劇，這亦大都是男子自身的罪惡。所以聰明男子，必須反躬自省，如因身體虧弱之故，則速求有效補救，則無不收與利除弊，禍去得福之功。</p>
<p>什麼是有效補救？則必須採用生殖腺內分泌療法，即速服生殖腺製劑「生殖素」，最為對症特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猩猩鹿海狗等體中提即其生殖腺素、用科學方法複製而成，其中名貴滋補物質完全保存，且分量豐富，據德國名醫Millmiling　梅爾蜜林博士將此劑與其他類似製劑作比較試驗。不特證明其品質恒高出其他類似製劑五倍至十倍以上。即治愈病例，亦將高出三十倍左右云。良以此劑於服後一日夜間卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，助長發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，若繼績服用必可於短期內將上述各症根本治愈，並使身體益臻健康取延年益壽之效。惟有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（中英中法華英等大藥房有售）以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速。</p>
<h3>遺精治療的失敗和成功</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>有很多的青年因遺精治療失敗，而斷送了前途。這果是患者缺乏決心或無常識之故，但醫藥方面也應負相當的責任。青年人所以有遺精，大都為犯自瀆從慾，把性神經斵傷了。性神經衰弱或呈過敏現象，則精關每失其所司，遺精即由此而起。我們知道了這一點，慾治療遺精，必須從鞏固精關與滋養及鎮靜神經着手。德國希米脫博士所秘製之「希米脫氏固精片」，即完全具此功能。所以凡能用此藥者，無不收藥到病除之功。要是服用了其他雜牌如遺精片之類。因功能微弱，在治療上每致失敗。遺精治療失敗或遷延失治則所謂「涓滴不塞會潰成江海」。症象勢必惡化，或竟致精秥血竭，百病　生。則凡服力衰弱，健忘失眠，腰酸背痛，滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育等症，即相繼併發，此種青年不特不能求學習業，前途暗無天日，就是夫婦生活上，亦必無法美滿，家庭每因此陷出悲劇，或子女無出，未老先衰，早年殤亡！所以遺精的及早澈底根治，實為患者急切必要之圖。德國鄰博士曾推崇「希米脫氏固精片」實為遺精青年唯一的救星。如因遺精已引起上述症者，須兼服生殖腺索製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，滋養神經，能繼績服用，必可早目恢復美滿健康。患者若親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療注射等法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>乳峯萎癟的威脅與挽救</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>西紗窗下對菱花，調脂弄粉施鉛華，更衣忽見變乳癟,揉碎芳心只自嗟！無論什麼錯誤，什麼缺陷，要是沒人戳穿，或是自已並沒有想到，倒也不覺得什麼，及至一被人家戳穿，自已再細細地想上一想，便愈發覺得難看，愈發覺得坐立不安了。例如乳峯萎癟的女子，當她晨起對鏡，調脂弄粉的時候，自已未甞以為不美，照樣子左顧右盼，洋洋得意，可是等到拿了衣服更換時，一眼瞧到雙乳萎癟的醜態，使會把先前的滿臉得意情況，驟然冷了下來。甚至芳心揉碎，自嗟自嘆，而莫名痛恨！</p>
<p>然此所說，還不過是自已的嗟嘆，要是再有旁人給她冷嘲熱諷一下，則其內心的慘痛為保似！所以一個人的身上，總不能有缺陷，有了缺陷，應積極加以彌補，如乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削，健美喪失的女了，其主要原因，為卵巢機能衰弱，以致影響新陳代謝作用所致，最對症而可靠的唯一方法，自以服生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用『生殖素』為最佳，蓋此劑成分高貴，配製精良，歷經世界各國名醫證明，均認為藥性和平，功效偉大，服後一日夜間，即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，曖宮止帶，如繼績服用，不特可使萎癟的乳峯，日形高聳，同時且能使瘦削的臀部，漸形豐腴，增進夫婦愛情，促進妊娠機能，強身駐顏，誠為近代婦女的唯一聖藥。</p>

<p>— 淋病專科戴德醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：北京路四川路轉角</p>
<p>義務送診僅收號金四角</p>
<h3>怎樣是淋　病根治之秘訣？</h3>
<p>近來一般市醫，對於淋病學上所宣傳的，似乎僅僅一種，這一種的宣傳就是徧重於療法方面。但是要根本解决淋病，必須履行下列的三個條件，才可實現：</p>
<p>（一）醫家本身的學識和經騐！</p>
<p>（二）設備宜周密並宜隨時代而子展！</p>
<p>（三）病家宜信賴有聲譽而負責的專家！</p>
<p>能履行上列三個條件，則一切淋病，不愁無解决。第一條件，醫家如能有豐富的醫學上的知識，更有豐富的臨床經騐，而具有嶄新的腦筋，庶幾不因多年臨床上的經騐而自囿，否則經騐愈多，頭腦愈舊，不肯吸收新知識，而成爲時代的落伍者。此種醫家，並不足貴，第二條件，是設備方面，現在因科學進歩，一日千里，在淋病治療上的設備，自宜採用最進歩的醫械。此方面余每考察歐美各大醫院新設備，而年有增購最新的醫械。例如顯微鏡，膀胱鏡等醫械，必每年更換。以促增診斷上的效能。第三條件，凡肯負責任而聲譽素孚的醫家，病家宜信服勿渝。能遵以上所説淋病絶對可以治愈。這就是根治淋病的秘訣。凡是患急慢性淋，如攝護腺炎，膀胱炎，前後尿道炎，睪丸炎，關節炎等，則除去用最新醫械行精細檢查診斷外，一方必須有德國濾淋平流電療法，德國希氏血淸，冷電法，各號菩齊，自家菌苗等，均可對症施行，少則二星期，多至五星期左右，即可十愈其十。</p>

<p>第一是要能認識時代趨向小學敎師是在現實社會中服務、並且要指導兒童去適應未來的社會、做將來社會的中堅、所以我們除指導兒童處理日常生活問題以外、還要能敎學他們明瞭現社會的實况及將來的趨勢、要做到這一點、所以他自己先耍有明確的認識及切實的把握、自己有了認識、才不至動搖疑慮、才能積極努力、</p>
<p>第二要確立高尚人格小學敎師是兒童的師表、社會的明燈、允其在這複雜的都市環境裹惡勢力充斥、隨時能給我們以引誘和威脅、我們要能主張正義堅守立塲、必須有威武不能屈、富貴不能淫的態度、才能爲學生表率、爲民衆先導、</p>
<p>第三要熱心敎育事業敎育楚小學敎師本身的事業、如果缺少敎學興趣、一定不會有良好的成續、要知道這許多天眞爛漫的兒童都是未來國家的棟樑、許多父母的愛子、他們的前途都握在我們的手裹、我們萬不能因工作的繁忙、薪水的微小、而疎忽我們的責任、敎學是一種精神事業、精神上的酬報、決不是任何物質的代價所能企及的、</p>
<p>第四是注意個人進修小學敎師須有廣闊的文化之基礎、和豐富的時事的知識、所以要隨時隨地注意進修、除閱讀書報外、還可以補習各種專門功課的技能、但是這種還是書本上的知識、此外還須在性情上思想上下進修的工夫、使自己不獨有豐富的學識、適當的技能、還須有和善的性情、前進的思想、才能應付裕如、得到兒童的信仰了、</p>
<p>第五要參加團體活動人是羣性動物、一個人決不能離羣索居、獨立圖存、允其是現在的時代、更須注意團結和組織、我們必須改正孤僻的習慣、參加團體的生活、在團體裹不要說集體精神可以訓練、合作事業可以發展、就是對於個人的進修和娛樂、也一定可以得到很大的帮助呢、</p>
<p>第六努力社會工作</p>
<p>小學敎師不僅是一個敎育工作人員、除兒實外、還負有改革社會的資任、校外的活動很多、我們可以選擇必耍的、或與社會敎育有密切關係的前往參加、並且隨　指尊、發表意見、以領導一般的民衆、並且社會上有許多現實敎材、還可以供敎學上的參考呢、</p>
<p>以上的六點、是新時代的小舉敎師必須做到的幾個基本條件、我們如果能够遵照着牠、切實去做、才能不辜負這大時代所給予我們的使命、</p>
<p>親愛的小學敎師、大家振作起來、努力向光明之途前進、</p>

<p>新蓬與新藥週刋中國醫學藝術論（一）  張鳳　　本文引言　　這是一個有趣味的問題：一說到醫學，是如何一件沉重的事體，非但是一件普通的科學，而且是一件專門而又獨立，精績而又可以實騐的科學；一說到藝術，那便是趣味橫生，情感發越，引人欣賞的事體。倘然能够把醫學與藝術聯絡起來，創造一段醫學藝術論，使絕對的醫學科學論徬徨趦趄起來，豈不是一椿趣事！在理，絕對的醫學科學論的本身，並非不可加以懷疑·即人生是吾是一部無情的機器，可以加油加水，截割貼補爲能事？我們治學的人們不妨懷着天大的胆，冒天下的大不韙：在可信中求其可疑，在可疑中求其可信，那末絕對的醫學科學論，豈不有了徬徨趦趄的狀態，不能直綫進行，不能單刀直入，不能探虎穴而取虎子，在科學醫方面，正未可欿然自滿，而醫學藝術論在這個常兒雖不能說可以抬頭，幷不能說可以穩穩爭到一個立足點；而至少可以噓一口氣，說幾句話，所以我在這里並不想爲中國號學護短，也不想爭長，祇是在業餘者立塲，討論一個新穎而且有趣味的問頗罷了。　　作者立塲　　這個問題——中醫是藝術——本也並不是丁濟南先生第一個人提出來的，近人梁漱溟先生在他的東西文化及哲學也會發過裹面對於這問題有關係的話；可是本人在此時未有此書可以參考。　　本人對於醫學是一個業餘者，初無深刻的研究，在許多年前，會把中國醫學結緣隨喜過一回，結巢爲科學的常識所攻破，直認中國醫學與中國藥劑是兩件事體，始終以懷疑態度置之，一擱二十餘年，用懷疑態度治別種學術，不在話下。近一年以來，看到了不少的流亡疾苦，兵災疫癘，不免起了「悲天潤人」在顛沛流離之中，痌　在抱的感念，於是父把舊話重提，由研究公衆衛生而轉到個人衛生，再由個人衛牛而轉到疾病治療，本來本人的治學過程，是大往大來的，時而文，時而學，時而疑，時而信，在我個人胸中毫無成見，孔子說「學則不固」的訓言，可以說是我的毛病；但在另一方面也是我的好處——不頑固！　　中國的醫學旣楚一件事，其藥學又是一件事，懷疑父懷疑，一個悶葫蘆不能打破，在「一物不知儒者之恥」的一句口號下，打動我的心情，耍求得一個暫時的解決，於楚不得不把舊學新知加以商兌，把從前的慢火工加熱一點，無如這一個大問題究竟太大，一時的急火功，總不能得到一個純靑或白熱的時期。虧得藝術這僩名詞，本人也能一知半解也算曾經在這藝術修養中陶冶過一番的人，或者是一個藝匠。那末把中國醫學與藝術兩個名詞聯合起來，中開大胆的假設，加以一個「是」字，慢慢地求他種種例證。　　最近與問鄉葉勁秋兄時時唔面，時或談及到中國醫學，他示我以丁濟南先生演講詞英文記錄及玉林君的另一篇文字，我很興奮地接着，馬上譯出來作參考。丁先生的話（或者是筆者疎略）前後分成兩橛，前半的演辭，丁先生演述舊醫書的術語，而自己也加以斷定爲不科學不合理的批評，後半却加上了一大轉語，添上了一句Still　Cures，說出中國醫學（指陰陽五行等）仍舊可以療治疾病。這一個「大然而」「特然而的轉語來得非常生硬，庸報的玉林君所以要反辱相譏了。（註：丁先生原文具在，明報筆者的記錄確是脫略不足爲據的。）　　看丁先生的了解藝術的程度，在他的演辭中，有下列的若干意思，如「師長不能盡敎」「弟子們須用優越天才和能力以自己領悟，」及不能從專於說明指示着話言，似乎是在解說中國醫舉是一個藝術上的最高點妙處，然而這寥寥數語不足搆成中國醫學是藝術的論據，有加以補充與證實的必要。　　說到藝術，本亦非三言兩語所司了事·，有藝術的修養，有藝術的智巧，有藝術的手腕。丁先生所說的大意：可以意會而不可言傳，在有藝術修養的人們，確能如是感到，但使中國醫藥而常在如是游栘惝恍不可名狀的奧義中傳授，是難以爲訓的。無已！我在這裹多事地添加幾句智巧與手腕上的話罷。　　中國醫學中的陰陽五行旣不可憑，而其治療疾病確也有不可磨減的功續，那末其藝術手腕與其智巧在那里呢？我在這里很粗疏地簡峪地直抄古人的譎巧，聊以見中國醫學楚一個藝術的輪廓。至其詳細理論與舉例，非在短篇論文中所可　事，這正要有待於有志促進中國醫學的人們去張皇補苴其間的。通俗醫話分娩時母體及胎兒自身之死亡原因（續第十九期）  瞿紹衡　　八，脚氣衝心脚氣別爲三極，曰乾性脚氣，日濕性脚氣，曰衝心性脚氣。溫性者，以浮腫及知覺異常爲主徵，乾性者，以肌肉萎縮及麻痺爲主徵，衡心脚氣者，心臟突然麻痺之謂也，姙婦易忠脚氣，且易遭致衝心。本症之來，疾如雷電，故亦不及救治。　　九，急性中毒急性中毒者，因化學的物質之作用，而急激妨害健康，或喪失生命之謂也，屬於此類之物質，甚多，然於分娩時發生者較少。中毒症有關僩人的素質，蓋個人對於毒物之感受性，不特因年齡及强弱而有參差，即成人對於同一毒物，亦未必盡呈同一反應，如淋巴性體質（即胸腺遺存甚久，且全身淋巴腺及淋巴瀘胞腫大，）者，對於毒素抵抗頗弱，故易致死。　　十，敗血症敗血症者，病原菌侵入血行，而發生之危險症也，其毒力猛烈，散布迅速，藥力難奏功效，心身衰弱者，允易死亡。　　B分娩時胎兒死亡原因之屬於自身者　　胎兒在子宮內時，其氣體交換工作，均藉胎盤與臍帶以爲之。故胎盤臍帶之血行，一旦交通阻絕，則胎兒即受重大影響，姙娠或分娩經過中，因子宮收縮，胎盤臍帶受其壓榨，則氣體交換之途被阻，而胎兒體內炭酸蓄積，以致刺激延髓及呼吸中樞，而胎兒遂於未出產道以前，先營呼吸矣，是曰胎兒早期呼吸。然此時胎兒所吸者，乃充塞於產道內之羊水，血液，粘液，及胎糞而已。此不特無補於氣體交換，益足爲空氣進路之障物，故呼吸中樞備受刺激，而繼即陷於麻痺，麻痺則死。胎兄在子宮內發生早期呼吸之原因，分述如左：　　一，發生於母體者；　　（甲）陣痛過强，而胎，　血行障礙。　　（乙）因分娩第二期遷延，而　體决受壓迫。　　（丙）因母體血行及呼吸器障礙，（例如心臟病，肺病，大出血，瀕死，死亡，干　，嗎啡麻醉等，）而胎兒氣體交換不足。　　二，發生於胎兒及附屬器者。　　（甲）早期破水，則臍帶胎盤受壓於胎兒子宮之間，而起循環障礙。　　（乙）胎盤搆造異常，及早期剝離。　　（丙）臍帶壓迫及斷裂。（例如臍帶脫出，臍帶結節，臍帶纏絡，及臍帶過短）。　　（丁）兒頭壓迫。（例如腦壓迫，及頭蓋內出血）。　　（戊）胎見失血及損傷。　　（己）胎兒氣道壓迫。（例如甲狀腺或胸腺肥大）。　　（庚）胎兒心臟機能障礙及血管異常。　　（辛）聲門水腫，或頸部呼吸器周圍組織之浮腫。　　（壬）胎兒發育不全。（完）醫家傳記德國細菌學始祖Robert　Koch事略  問纘曾　　生平三大著作　　脾脫疸病學，結核病學，及霍亂病學。　　本年五月二十七日爲德國細菌學始祖考霍Koch博士逝世第二十九週紀念，作者寓歐時，每見歐洲之各醫學機關，於是日作紀念儀式，或於通俗報紙內，發行紀念特刊，刊越其生平事歷，夫今日之警舉，醫學家固可以自慰，診斷治療悉已科舉化，然考其歷史，亦不過一二百年，除少數病患有絕對把握外，餘則仍無特殊之診療法，未免引爲遺憾！考霍氏發現結核桿菌，霍亂弧菌，及脾脫疸病菌，迄今亦不過五六十年，吾國地處溫熱帶，患霍亂病及脾脫疸病者，屢有所見，結核病之傳播於中國民族。爲數更令人駭聞，飲水思源，略述其史歷，聊以紀念之，幷敬獻與有旨趣於醫學史之同好，共申一片敬仰之忱！　　考霍氏Koch爲結核桿菌，霍亂弧菌，脾脫疽菌之發明者，平生研究醫學，對於傳染病學，有極大之供獻，誕生於一八叫三年十二月十一日，死於一九一〇年五月二十七臼，享年六十五歲有半。　　哥廷根城Goettingen東北之Harz爲其誕生地，父業鑛工，所入不豐，四齡即入學，家居時習宇於其胞兄，幷於自然科學，特饒興趣，然不甚致力。九歲時作書與旅行期中之嚴父，建議改革乃父園地，更關懷乃父之健康，願其多多散步，竟如一小醫生然。其後乃父經濟較裕，允其肄業於哥廷根大學，初研究數學物理，繼則改入醫科，畢業後，渴望能爲一船醫，而終因年歲過稚，未能如願，及至三十歲之後，始了其心願。　　一八六六年德國漢堡霍亂盛行，考霍氏Koch適工作於堡城病院，彼曾一度默念斯病之發生，必由於病原體，當時之醫學，僅惟含糊推論而已，所謂病原體者，乃瘴氣Miasmen及傳染素Kontagien也。考霍氏Koch竟日探尋病原體於霍亂病者之排洩物內，幷用鉛筆鈎畫此病原體之雛形，然終於缺乏科學之證明。（未完）宋國賓啓事　　鄙人自主編本刊同時並未主編其他刋物四日大美週報醫藥特刊欄列賤名爲主編曷勝榮幸惟內容文字並未寓目而某舊醫爲巳宣傳之謬說允絕對不能負責特此聲明即希讀者注意食養常識食養之科學研究（續第十七期）  周振禹　　（三）食養之化學分類　　人亦動物也。其體之組織，極爲複雜，蓋循乎其應用，有以致之也。人體旣甚複雜，其食養叉何不然，在動物界內，人爲無物不食之動物（Omnivorous　Animal）·今欲將無物不食之動物底食養，分門別類地研究，實非易事。茲先就其化學上之組織，分別論之如下。　　食養可分爲兩種，每種分爲三類，列表如下；　　（甲）主要食養之類別　　（一）炭水化物質（Carbonydrates）　　（二）脂油（Fats　andVils）　　（三）蛋白質（Proteins）　　（乙）次要食養之類別　　（一）水（Water）　　（二）礦物質（Minerals）　　（三）維他命（Vitmins）　　（甲）主要食養　　（一）炭水化物化學之淺說　　炭水化物者，人體之燃料也。共用頗爲繁重，故在自然界內，散布圾廣，其化學之組織，爲炭（Carbon），氫（Hydsogen）氧（Oxygen）三元素也。其化子內所含之氫氧元素，適等於水所含之氫氧（氫2氧）例如6O+6H2O=C6H12O6。6H12O6者，乃極單純之炭水化物之一，即葡萄糖。故有其名稱也。其來自植物界者圾多，例如米麥山芋甘蔗蘿蔔蜀黍及四時水菓是也。動物體內雖有，但其量甚微　　（一）炭水化物可別爲類：　　單價糖類（Monosaccharides）　　（二）變價糖類（Disaccharides　　（三）多價糖類（Polysaccharides）　　單價糖類者，乃最簡以之炭水化物，惟有此類之炭水化物，方可爲血液吸收，由血循環運輪各部，以便應用也。查此類之炭水化物有三：曰葡萄糖（Ghicose）水菓糖（Fructose及乳分子糖（Galuetose）是也。查此三類糖均為C6H12O6所組成，惟於搆造上有所區別，例如葡萄糖及水菓糖，列式如下：（未完）</p>

<p>自由談糾正一個錯誤的觀念  蘇蘇　　遇到一個朋友，問他近來在何處得意。他起初說賦閒在家，但繼則說在一隻小學校里擔任幾點鐘的功課，於是就似笑非笑地對我說：　　「老兄，這是暫時躲一躲風雨的，將來有機會，哈，老兄！……」　　把當小學敎師的神聖事業，作爲「暫時躲一躲風雨的」這種觀念，我想，在全上海的小學敎師中，有意識無意識地存在着的，恐怕不在少數之例吧。　　道是上海小學敎育界的嚴重危機，因着這種非凡錯誤的觀念潛伏着，無疑將影響到我們中舉民族的新芽的成長的。　　我們應該糾正這一個錯誤的觀念。　　誠然，在目前，小學敎師是不被人所重視的，甚至是被人輕蔑的。「冷板凳」，「猢猻王一，道些不雅共聽的名稱，加諸小學敎師的身上，證明了小學敎師在一般的社會地位」上的低落。常然，我們也不吾認，在上海灘上，小學校也的確成了在政治上和商業上失敗下來的英雄們的躲避風雨之處。然而輕蔑小學校敎師，正如輕蔑了他自身一樣，誇大點說，是對自己的祖國的一種罪行。說兒童是未來的國家的主人翁」，而又對迭成「兒童們」爲未來國家的主人翁的事業，加以輕蔑，試想：造不是對祖國的一種罪行是什慶？　　再來一個誠然，小學敎師的確如一般人所說，是「淸寒」的。一個汽車夫，他會比一個小學敎師的收入要來得高點。但是這里我們要明白，當「小學敎師」不是在商號里面當經理」，是專門講「生意經」的。不，小學敎師是神聖的事業，是造成未來國家主人翁的敎育者，我們不從「生意經上着想，而要在「國家民換」的前途上去着想。當然，我在這里並不是說，對於小學敎師自身的待遇可以不要奮爭，可以置諸腦後。相反，我們要爭取我們小學敎師的合理的生活條件的，這並不和我們的神聖的理想相衝突。　　今天在孤島上的小學敎師，他們雙肩上的職責，是和前綫上的武裝同志一樣的重大。在所謂「淪陷區」中，侵略者已把我們天眞無邪的小朋友們的腦經，來加以改造，改造得適合他們的侵略意志，就是說，改造得都成爲馴順的小奴隸。我們在他們的報紙上，可以看見一兒童園地」，從新聞中，可以曉得有所謂兒童親善交誼會」，爲着預防游擊隊的破壞鐵路交通，有所謂「鐵路愛護少年團」的組織，（這，我在將出版的短篇童話集「小鉛兵」中，巳經寫成童話，揭破侵略者的狠心毒課。）諸如此類的麻醉組織以及其所謂敎育的措置，眞楚不一而足！我們的小學敎師們，難道可以抱着躲躲風雨」的觀念來跟小把戲」們「纏纏」麽？　　顯然是不能的！　　我們不怕別人的輕蔑，只有在自己自暴自棄」的時候，才會給人以輕蔑！我們應賅經正我們的「躲躲風雨」的錯誤觀念。我們要担負起神聖的貴任來！我相信，總有一天，輕蔑我們的入，會對我們道歉，而我們呢，也將是不愧爲一個中華民族的忠誠的兒女。一致的力量（木刻）  凌雲龍作帶鞋子（上）  明枝　　——老奶奶的故事——　　「呀，好久不見你了；你怎麽今天又會來的？」茶　上的李金根，一看見老奶奶就這樣喊了出來。　　老奶奶還楚那一個樣子，臂灣嘉挽着淺沿的籃子，在費豆『上次豆賣完了，就回到家裹去取；不料正要再來時，便聽說　上有些不太平，一直嚇着不敢來，直到現在，打聽得巳經沒有什麽了，所以才再來做生　。』　　『不但不太平，美不多連我的命都送了！』李金根慨然說。　　他有着一般鄉下農人的公同習無，喜歡將自己所遇到的事淸，允其危險事淸，形容得過份些。據他說，那天晚上攻進公大薾行來時，他從後門溜出來，在像雨點一般的槍弹下，爬了許多路，才算逃得了性命，不過，他說，他的大腿上，却已吃了一粒槍彈，到如今走路還不大便常。　　他說着，就將褲管拉起了指給老奶奶看。果然，在他的左腿上，還有　帶綁着，不過到底不　得是受的什麽傷。　　『要不是「他們」明天趕緊給我醫治。　怕　　這條　已經不中用了。「你們」待人到底是好的。』　　老奶奶笑笑說，『是的竟會這樣的。』　　這時，茶樓上的茶客，有些早已知道孚金根的故事，聽了李金根的話，也沒有什麽表示。但有些是今天第一决來這裹喝茶的，聽見了就不免過來看看，各自發着一些言論。　　李金根還在滔滔不絕地談着那天晚上的事情，不但說得有如荼如火之觀，使人好像目擊其事，還夾着許多「他們好，「他們」怎樣怎樣的話。　　『請你吃些黃沙豆補補吧，』老奶奶看他說得不停，就從籃子裹撈了一把放到桌子上。「這是吟化子蓮心，是補受傷的人。』　　『唷，我倒志了，我還欠你豆錢呢？』李金根一看見豆就說。『該多少，今天一總給你。』　　「哈哈，』老奶奶大笑說，『你忘了豆錢。我還忘了你的鞋子呢！』　　『前幾大我到李家橋去過的，到了你的家裹。你的妻子說，你帶回去的錢她收到的，她知道我還要到這裹來賣豆，看得見你，所以呌我帶了一雙鞋子給你。』　　『那末鞋子呢？』　　『現在放在我的姨甥錢阿森家裹。』　　接着，老奶奶就和李金根就說定，下半天他一有空，就到錢阿森的家裹去取鞋子，豆錢也在那時帶去，不必現在給她。錢阿森所住的地方，老奶奶自然都詳細告訴了他。　　老奶奶看見第一步月的已經達到，雖然籃子裹的豆還沒有賣完，就緩緩地下了茶樓，回到錢阿森的家裹。　　『會來的？』錢阿森一看見她就間。　　『會來的。」老奶奶說，『但是你不要和他多說什麼，聽我說。』　　錢阿森是出名的快嘴，所以她不能不這樣可囑。　　在下午三西點鐘的時候，李金根果然拐着腿來了。錢阿森非但不和他說什麽，却在招呼一聲之後，就走到外面去，在門口守着，看有沒有人闖進來，或來竊聽。當然，這也是老奶奶敎他的。　　『眞是謝謝你，』李金根一走進來就說，『爲我帶了鞋子一來。』　　『你坐下來談談，鞋子等你回去時我去取出來。』　　『我家裹怎樣？』李金根就坐之後說。　　『是呀，我就是要吿訴你家裏的事情。』　　她將她幾天之前到李家橋云的事情，都仔細說給他聽了，他覺得很放心，謝了謝，立起來就想走。「讀書與作文」  儲玉坤　　張素民先生憑了三十年來讀書興作文的經騐，寫成「讀書與作文」一書。出版後，要我發表一些意見。我認爲這部書，不但以讀書的方法指導靑年如何去讀書，而且還有一種深厚的意義，要養成社會上好讀壽的空氣。　　社會上讀書空氣的稀薄，固然有許多客觀的因素，但是一般靑年都沒有養成讀書的習慣，却是其中最主要的原因。我認爲好讀書，是現代靑年應具有的條件之一。有一位朋友徵求我對於選擇配偶的條件，我首先就提出「有讀書的習慣」；因爲不論男女靑年，如在求學時期，就能養成讀書的習慣，那末他或她的將來，一定有很大的希望；學校敎育，不過指示你一個讀書的門徑，學問的成功，一定要在離開學校之後。我國留學生在外國大學讀書，往往名列前茅，可是成就終不及別國學生，最大的原因，由於我國留學生回國後，就不再繼續讀書，不繼續研究；怎能有偉大的成就呢？　　外國固有許多科學家著作家學同家，由於自己的刻苦好學而獲成功；就是我國文化界，也頗不乏人，所以一個靑年，祇要能養成好讀書的習慣，就有很遠大的前途。其實讀書，也是一種消遺，不過讀書的樂味，祇有愛讀書的人能够嘗到。目前孤島上的靑年，都沉醉在電影院跳舞塲等娛樂塲所，追求片刻的刺激與歡樂，完全由於靑年對於讀書未能發生興趣所致。是以耍轉變孤島的風氣，應先在靑年界展開普遍的讀書運動，以養成社會上讀書的空氣。張素民先生的著作，實含有這樣深切的意義。　　我除向讀者推薦張先生的著作外，並期望負有領導靑年的敎育家，應針對着孤島靑年的通病，提倡讀書運動，使人人都有好讀書的習慣。（義賣獻金）談餘  編者　　今天是「敎師節」，「糾正一個錯誤的觀念」，和「我不騙他們」，就是紀念道佳節而作的，請讀者注意。　　時常有人來問本刊的投稿章程，現在在此總答覆一下。本刊並沒有什麽特殊的投稿章程，一切情形，正和任何副刋差不多。誰都可以投稿，只要是優美的稿，總可以登出來。一經登出來，就以現金爲酬。稿費每月底結算一决，在下月的十七十八十九三日內，請投稿者携帶印鑑來本館會計處領取。我不騙他們  賀安　　我會經是一個敎師，以後有機會或許仍還耍敎敎書。　　但是因爲做敎師，所以常常要應付孩子們的要求，——要求講故事。　　然而，我是何等拙劣的一個說故事者啊！　　有人承認：如果故事說得不大好（內容方面），給孩子們的壞處楚很大的。我怎敢給他們毒藥嚐呢？　　我旣也曾是一個孩子，所以，我明瞭吃了毒藥的害處。到現在，在更深夜靜，或則悽淡的月夜，每一個細微的聲饗，或任何黑影，都給我的心以不能自制的震跳，因爲「鬼」這偭恐怖的名謂襲擊我。有時，我或者恪遵許多可尊敬的故事所給的敎訓，對於許多不能容忍的事情容忍了下來，我變成「老成」了。有時，公主也趁着機會跑進我的思想中，我幻想自己最好能變做一個王子。……　　說老實話，我對於這僩世界的認識，那不過是不久之前。那時，我是在另外一個世界中。我會經是一個循現蹈矩的孩子，也曾希望以後是一個循規蹈矩的大人，——一切都應該依照那些可尊敬的故事中的敎訓發展的！　　但是等我自己醒來，那似乎已是遲了一些。我巳經失去我最可貴的時代了！　　自然，我居然也「忝爲人師」了。我的敎訓和良心警告我，，不能使他們也陷入我的命運的覆轍。　　所以憑着我的一股熱心，憑着我的在妄的自見，我杜撰了許多不高明的故事。相信巳在橄欖和有毒的糖菓中，選擇了前一件，作爲給孩子們的禮物。　　所以，雖然我是一個拙劣的說故事者，然而我是一個誠樸的鄉下人，我所播種的是稻毅或麥子，却決不是美麗的罌粟花。　　或者，這些話對於「敎師節」是離題太遠了。然而，作爲一個敎師，忽略了這個問題，恐怕也是一件罪過吧。</p>

<p>春秋昨日開幕　上海婦孺敎養院  南燕　　七石個女人及小孩　　一個小規模的婦孺敎養院，昨天下午二時啟幕了，地點遠得很，在滬西工廠區域的小沙渡路上。　　後面就是泛着黑色的蘇州河，河憂停滿了各種各色的赤膊船，一羣工人的孩子，停留在河裹的木排上，中間有一個衣服脫得光光的，「這水能够游泳麼？！太髒了。」實際這個區域裹，沒有一處不髒，一部大卡軍聞過，就是一大陣烟灰，牠能塞滿你的鼻子與喉口。　　對岸，你知道，那是什麼地方——。遠遠地有幾家烟囪在置着烟，被轟燬了的工廠，又在設法開工了吧？這小沙渡路上，沒有工做的男人女人多得很，他們都是無知無識的，被人騙着，用最低的工資，被人家吸吮着鮮血。　　婦孺敎養院，便設在這陰陽交界的邊緣上，充滿了灰塵，烟煤的空氣當中，這恐怕是唯一的一片乾凈土了。這裹面被收留着七十個可憐的女人和孩子，她們太多都沒有家，沒有故鄉，沒有父母，沒有親戚朋友的可憐人，但是，和一般流落往街頭的人比起來，她們確是在天堂裹了。　　這個婦孺敎養院的董事長爲林康侯，支持這個敎養院的，是上海市市民聯合會，原來敎養院院址，就是市民聊合會第四區分會。房屋並不大，只有一層，樓下爲辦公室，工塲，及課室。　　樓上爲婦孺宿舍，都是二層及三層的高鋪。　　全院共分四組　　現在讓我們談一談敎養院的內容：　　　這所敎養院——，以前本來是收容所，現在把收容所改成了敎養院，所以現在所收留的人數，除了二三個新進來的以外，其餘都是養人。　　現在人數是女人二十八人，六歲上兒童二十六人，六歲以下十六人，共計七十人，他們預定計劃是收容一百五十人　　全院有職員，工人等二十人，據說職員給很低，我們希望每一個職員都能做到廉潔負責的地步。一切收容所中可怕的情形，希望這規模較小的敎養院中不要發現。　　收容婦孺，規定每人每月三元，以現在七十人計算，還不能算多，祗二百餘元。連事務課經贊，的三百餘元，總可以開銷了吧。　　每天食糧，是由救濟會裹撥來的，每天是七十磅米，十磅麥，每天兩粥一飯。　　全院管理荼統，共分叫組：　敎育組——預備開設短期小學班：　生產組——設有縫紉班，備有六架脚踏縫級機；還有籐工班，是預備敎兒童及女人的；　管理組；　事務組。　　火綫下三個孩子　　院中負責人之一的張老先生，他告訴我兩件富有敎育性的故事，同時也可以反映，在抗戰中的中國兒童，他們和他們父母一樣，受到了多少磨難　　第一：是一個木匠的兩偭兒子，他們的家本來是在劉家行，遺　個孩子的母親已經早去世了，一打仗，父子三人就逃到了安事，這兩個孩子價賣着方糕過臼子，後來安亭一混亂，父子便分開了。這由個孩子，便流落到上海來，被人送到敎養院去，起先還不知道他們兩個人的身世，直到有一天，兩個孩子作文的時候，他們用了很淸通的文學，把自己遭遇的故事寫了出來。他們住在院中一年，（從前是收容所）他們的父親找遍了上海收容所，才找到那裹，把兩個孩子領回去了。　　在中國抗戰的炮火中，這一家三人又團圓了。　　第二個：是個十歲的孩子，「八一三」以後，孩子的母親把兒子丟開走了，這孩子使過着小偷樣的乞丐生活，後夾有人把他送到院中以後，雖然首先很頑皮，但近來巳經改好了，而且天資很聰明。　　由這個例子來看，可見中國兒實的質地是並不壞的，祇要有人負責來敎養他們。　　據說院中訂有認養辦法，如願意撫養的，也可以領回去吳陳講座小記  瘦鵑　　吳湖帆陳小蝶二兄合作講授詩文書畫，一時報名弟子，多至七十餘人，但結果取中者不過十人，其中六名爲大學畢業生，二名爲銀行秘書，餘亦學有根底，非泛然之流，昔人有登李郭之鬥，如登龍門者，吳陳講座似之矣。陳君詩學深湛，嘗於廬山陳三立先生命奧訪之，一見訝然曰：吾以子爲六十許人，乃尚壯耶？其文則爲林果廬先生所推服，臨歿爲臀致陳，未終篇而卒，有吾於壽伯茀外，不謂於忘年中得陳生生，時陳年僅二十耳。廬山專江小鶼言之，畏廬事則林季椿言之，季椿，畏廬之第五子也。湖帆畫寖寖入古，不作第二人想，平生弟子僅王選靑一人，今忽生宏願，爲廣大敎主，得師如此，吾誠爲十子奢幸矣。然原定吳陳學額本不止此，荀有高足，願列門增者，吾知二君當尚不拒也。雨過天靑  包天笑　　第十一回　認鄉親杵臼舊生涯　附權勢簮纓新貴族　　前面說過，趙樂天在文字上是不過爾爾，寫來也未必能怎樣委婉動聽。但也爲了潘佩英的緣故，寫了有七八張的信　。不過末了有幾句話，他却隱諷着她：倘然實在動不醒的，你似乎可以脫離這個惡劣的家庭。以趙樂天與潘佩英兩人的交誼，也够得上資格，說這句話了。那知這封信寄去，却落在潘佩英父親的手中，這可發生了事變了。本來他們家裹人就不滿意於趙樂天的，近來父聽得他在組織什麽學生軍，游擊隊等等，這可了得嗎？將來一定是要殺身惹禍的。他原楚一僩窮光棍，倒也不去管他。只是我們的道位小姐，聽說還時常給他通信，這種人還可以和他往來嗎？那不是要害及人家嗎？確是，潘佩英的父親，現在巳經是爲政府的官員了。以一個僞政府的官員，與什麽學生軍，游擊隊，當然是勢不兩立的。有了我，就沒有了他，倘然他們兩人，因爲從前同學的關係，到如今還糾纏不淸，將來要鬧出極犬的笑話來呢。况且看他信上的稱呼，以及信中的詞句，關見得是個不尋常的交誼了。倘然照他信上所說的，敎佩英脫離了家庭，試問脫離了家庭，到那裏去呢？自然到他那裹去呀！他把她誘引了去，他是個無家無室的人，跟着他到處亂跑，也去當女游擊隊去嗎？他自己是一個槍斃的坏子，誘引了女人去，也陪他一同槍斃嗎？這天晚上，潘佩英的父親，喚出佩英來，先是一頓臭罵。最後提出兩個條件來：一個條件，敎佩英痛痛快快寫一封回信拒絕他，以後就永不許再行通信，這是我們最寬厚的辦法，越他去學生軍也好，游擊隊也好，總之將來的結果下塲，是幾粒術生丸罷了，與我們沒有相干。　個辦法，還算是造化那小子，看他父親份上，我們還有一些親戚關係。若其不然，他還要糾纏不淸，那可只得用第二個條件了。他旣是游擊隊，我們給他勢不並立，我們不收拾他，他將來要收拾我們。現在我們知道他的地址所在，通知憲兵隊，派幾個憲兵，把他先抓了來。那就不管他親戚不親戚了。檢斃也罷，殺頭也罷，一切由他們處置。（一二九）信鴿的選擇與飼養  張文德　　在未買幼鴿時最先欲知生幼鴿之母鴿及父鴿，是否强健，是否原配，（即一胎所生下者），是否優良種，但初養鴿時以幼鴿及普通鴿子爲最適宜，因較老之鴿易於還巢性，故老鴿優良者不宜初養者。　　飼養　　幼鴿從蛋中孵出後，不像小雞，小鴨類，即自能啄食，在初生四五天內，由母鴿父鴿，飽食毅類，經過胃內消化，成爲乳酪似之流汁，射喂到幼鴿口內，但過六天後，漸漸混以未消化之穀物，亦可充食，總之幼鴿在未離巢之前，牠之飲食完全依父母鴿供給，大的一月後就能練習飛行於鴿舍四週，約一月半幼鴿即能同老鴿自由飛翔天空中矣。　　設備　　上海欲普及信鴿飼賽，非常困難事也，但通常皆設於住宅曬臺中，但鴿舍宜建於高燥處，亭園中，及農村廣塲中亦甚週宜，並圾須防貓，鼠，蛇，類之害。鴿舍分亭式，宜於庭園中，房屋式，宜於曬臺及曠塲中，及高層建築物上，鴿舍內留二三尺地位以便飼養者進出飼食，掃除，及留視一切，鴿舍牆板處，不使留有一洞，一穴。　　掃除　　鴿性最喜淸潔，對於鴿之歸巢與淸潔有莫大之關係，故鴿舍掃除又宜注意。最優者，光綫充足，容易乾燥，陽光每日能照到鴿舍內，反之，潮濕不潔，光綫空氣皆不良，日光水難昭到，簡直可說便信鴿生疾病之大本營，爲防禦外部寄生蟲發生，宜每月一次，將生石灰與膠混在一起，溶化後，拌成流汁，在鴿舍內到處灑撒，其决應於不礙春秋二季孵化期內，應將金部鴿子移入鴿籠內，搬在鴿舍外，將全部飲食器其全部洗净，另將全部鴿舍內，鴿房內之鴿糞，全行淸除之，並用刀剷去，後用石灰末散入鴿房內，上鋪黃沙一層，如見鴿翼上有扁蟲，廳即殺之。　　食物　　牡蠣末。蛋殼。鳥賊骨。防鴿身之石灰份不足，防鴿產軟蛋及不能孵化，助換羽毛，炭。能淸血統，增加食慾，調節體力，食鹽。補助健康，粟及稗子亦一種興奮劑，但不可單獨使用，及過度，綠豆，菜豆亦鴿之嗜好品，可防止口喝，在欲參加遠距離競賽，及傅書前用以喂少許最佳。　　管理之程序　　每日換水二次，水槽內如着有鴿糞，須即行換去，每日喂食時關須有規律時問，夏季鴿子亦須洗浴，鴿見水盆，即會去潑水如頸，胸，肩，背，羽毛，等處，多能潑到，見羣鴿浴後，飛向鴿舍外陽光中曬乾，此時即將水盆內水倒罄，以防鴿子飲後發生疾病。（未完）投寄書畫諸君注意　　昨日寄來書畫多件，均爲立軸等太件，製版既易損壞，收藏亦多困難，故大件書畫務請攝製照相寄來。昨日寄來者請於五時後親臨編輯室領回。「大俠野貓」感觀  李之華　　“The　Arizona　Wildcat”　　廿世紀福斯出品　國泰戲院映　　「金惠漱跟秀蘭鄧波兒差不多，她們的戲大都是特地爲她們編起來的，而那些爲她编劇的編劇家們又低能得根，祇想如何湊成一個故事，在故事中又如何使她們有所發揮（例如加一點歌舞進去之類），所以結果，觀衆們所看的往往不是戲，祇是戲裹的主角如何在裝腔作勢。明星制度的發展到推重衡壁，原是資本主義社會電影的必然現象之一，可是除有嚐痂之好的觀衆之外，其他的觀衆，即將爲這些「差不多」所嚇跑了，這樣的現象楚帮助一個明星的發展呢，還是斷送一個明星的前途？　　「大俠野貓」是金惠漱的差不多影片之一，內容是有「西部」風味的，可是以戰來講，她却楚個閑角，雖然她的鏡頭獨多，然而有什麼辦法呢，我們總覺得這個角色是在這個戲的中心意識之外，任憑「瑪麗無意中以彈藥置　灶內，彈藥爆發，地板破裂，歷來被刦之礦金赫然在內」，使得「大俠野貓一的劇情急轉直下，這個瑪麗正是金惠漱所飾，可是正如劇情的架空一樣，對於這穢一個脚色，我們總也覺得吊在半空。因爲這樣，就即使金惠漱的戲再多些，或是她演得再賣力些，我們對她的印象，也無法深起來。　　至於金惠漱本人的演技，則在這個戲裹楚不能算壞的。她賣力，她也不再是裝腔作勢的、那股小婦人腔，其原因，則是她在這個戲裏又、恢復了跳跳蹦蹦的野孩子了。而她是適宜於演野孩子這一類的脚色的，這就使人不致在一看到就替她覺得難過。　　「大俠野貓」的導演者，跟劇本一樣，不見、得高明。這多少也是使人對「大俠野貓」無深刻印象可言的原因之一。有人說」個電影演員的成名，劇本和導演是大有關係的，以金惠漱和狄安娜　萍來作例子，則多少可相信這句話有其疋確性。金惠漱的戲路雖和狄安娜實萍的戲路不同，可是如照她的戲路好好地選幾個戲來給她演，她的成就也許不會在狄安娜竇萍之下吧！　　可楚爲金惠漱所特編的戲，却總是選些老套子，這是捧她的塲呢，還是斷送她的前途呢？——我們正禁不住要替這位童星呼屈了。</p>

<p>游藝界驚人的劇訊  梅花館主　　前馮大總統三女公子秩大慶四大名旦余叔岩王瑤卿都參加　　——禮金移助難民救濟會　　沉寂的孤島、；不久將有一個空前的堂會出現，現在正在積極籌備中。日期是本月十五十六十七三天，（即禹歷四月二十八二十九和五月初一三天）地點在滬西愚園路白宅，所邀的角色，除梅　荀尚叫大名旦以及馬連良譚富英小翠花譚小培李萬春等以外，全滬人士所渴慕的余叔岩王瑤卿孟小冬三位，亦巳完全扣定，准時南來，像道樣盛大局面的堂戲，除十幾年前徐州府張大辮督署，濟南府張長腿宅中有過，此外都沒有這决所籌辦的齊全而叉精采。　　這次辦堂會的主人翁，旣不是令滬皆知的聞人，亦不是國府現任的官員，是一僩大家不知名的堂客，可是這位堂客的來頭亦不算小，原來就是前馮大總統的第三女公子芳名呌做碧頎女士的便是。這位馮女士，夫家是姓白，所以大家都稱她白太太的。本月十六日，是白太太五秩華誕之辰，親友們知道她愛好戲劇，所以要替她籌辦這一個盛大的堂會，白太太很是高興，就對主辦堂會的人說：「承各位發起唱戲，我並不推辭，可是錢得由我夾花，至於親友所餽贈的禮金，都得移助難民救濟協會，聊爲諸親友迭福。」諸親友曉得這位太太是一個宅心慈祥饑溺爲懷的人，亦就不跟她客氣了。據我所知，三天的戲目，和演員的支配，都已商定妥協，大的不至多所更動，這張支票，到期準可兌現。茲將全部戲目，和演員名銜，列表如左：　　（第一日）即六月十五日）　　（一）李萬春「林冲夜奔」　　（二）蓋呌天「三叉口」　　（三）金少山周瑞安「盜御馬」　　（四）尚小雲馬連良「三娘敎子」　　（五）荀慧生金仲仁馬富祿「鐵弓緣」　　（六）程硯秋孟小冬「珠廉寨」　　（七）譯富英「定軍山」　　（八）余叔岩梅蘭芳主瑤卿姜妙香李多奎張春彥「四郎探母代出關見娘」（余楊延輝，梅公主，王太后，姜楊宗保，李佘太君，張楊延昭）　　（第二日）（即六月十六臼）　　（一）李萬春「長板坡」　　（二）蓋呌天「武松打店」　　（三）程硯秋「全部余鎖記」　　（四）馬連良尚小雲金少山小翠花馬富祿「法鬥寺代大審」　　（五）荀慧生擊麟童「戰宛城」　　（六）孟小冬金少山「捉放曹代宿店」　　（七）梅蘭芳「麻姑獻壽」　　（八）余叔岩「戰太平」　　（第三日）（即六月十七日）　　（一）李萬春「兩將軍」　　（二）蓋呌天「智取北湖州」　　（三）馬連良尚小雲「蘇武牧羊」　　（四）程硯秋譚富英、「牧羊卷」　　（五）荀慧生「玉堂春」　　（六）梅蘭芳金少山譚富英「二進宮」　　（七）余叔岩尚小雲譚小增「戰蒲關」電影院義舉  敏普　　難童受惠不淺　　難　敎養院早定蓋二十三所　舍，且久已進　募軟，絡續得各界慷概解叠至今二十一所之經贊已無問難；惟餘二塵叫尚無端倪，爲速完成是項工作起見，本月三日難童敎養　董袁履登金宗城周邦俊三先生特邀中央戲院總理張色川君山西戲院張兆麟君及影界聞人卡毓麟君宴會於鄧脫摩飯店討論寡款問題，數經磋商後，色得完滿解決，議定該二座房舍由各影院聯合出資捐築，當塲並即定金城新光滬光中央四院各三百元，山西金門恩派亞各擔承二百元，明星西海光華卡兩登榮金則各出一百元計共二千三百元，自此六百名難童得能安受敎養矣！華商電影院能如此援助，間接亦即爲祖國盡力，這也未始不是值得頌讚的精神，希望以後能更形團結，負起責任，爲中國影院界放一異彩。（義賣獻金）卓別麟在新片「獨裁者」中之神情  （道）孤島戲劇界的義賣運動　　在各界都在進行義賣的準備中，孤島上戲劇界也在籌備義賣的演出、據悉規模甚大，參加的戲劇團體很多，節目已大體排定如下：上海劇藝社——人之初；互助劇團——花濺淚；銀聯劇團——緩期還債；華聯劇團————醉生夢死；夜鶯劇團——永久的朋友；保聯，精武，益友，工華四劇團聯合排演——阿Q正傳；職婦劇團——大雷雨，中法劇藝學校——舞蹈，復且劇團——生死戀，聞尚有其他劇團亦擬加入合作，舉行日期大的在六月十五日左右，若此大規模連合公演，孤島戲劇史上尚屬創舉，不啻爲孤島上另一形式的盛大戲劇節云。蘇聯新片「農夫曲」  方　　滬戰以後，上海影壇頗少蘇聯影片，聽說自從「女壯士」開映之後，滬光將每月開映一部蘇聯影片，這該是一個很好的消息吧。　　六月份開映的影片造「農夫曲」「農夫曲」以蘇聯集體農塲爲題材，寫蘇聯晨村制度改變之後，農民怎樣獲得和享受富裕幸福的生活。正因爲生活富裕了，遇着幸福快樂的生活，所以也產生了反映這種生活的喜劇影片。這樓幸編快樂的生活，是新制度的產物，它的基礎並不是像建築在舊世界矛盾關係上的荒淫的「快樂」生活，所以反映這種生活的影片自然也是脫去舊套而獨具一格的新型。　　是的，「農夫曲」是蘇聯新型的　劇。只有在蘇聯才會產生這種書劇。因爲鐘喜劇的原則楚建立在人與人的新的關係上，它描寫新世界的人們對於勢動的關係。它敘述農民們怎樣把「勞動日」衆多（勤於勞動的史塔哈諾夫農民）的女人尊爲「富新娘」，農民們怎樣爭相追逐「富新娘」以博取光榮，怎樣只有以「勞動日」同樣衆多的人才能獲得宮新娘」的「靑睞」，能「門當戶對」的結婚。　　導演貝里亦夫因爲製作了這部影片，創造了喜劇的新風格，獲得觀衆一致的歡迎，蘇聯最高蘇維埃特獎予蘇聯最榮譽的「列寗獎章」，和「彼得大帝」，「列寗在十月」同榜　　影片的背景是烏克蘭農村。烏克蘭素以風景絕佳著稱俄國。那裏天氣和暖，出產豐饒。烏克蘭善　的女人在田野裏一面做工一面唱歌，使這部影片增加不少讀情畫意。全片有許多歌曲，其中最著稱的便是「農夫曲」。　　「農夫曲」已決定自六月十四日起在滬光大戲院開映。（義賣獻金）華納攝製「我的奮鬥」  （華志）　　好萊塢影人，近來反侵略的情緒一天天熱起來。繼卓別林氏攻擊法西斯的一獨裁者」一片後，華納公司又又計劃將希特勒自傳，行銷世界七百萬冊的名著「我的奮鬥」，化爲故事搬上銀幕。當這還沒十分決定時，許多宗敎團體和猶太人早就興奮起來，促請該公司老板華納氏親目出馬主演，他們自已願意擔任客串，宜洩被壓迫民族的不平。華納氏的意見是同意的，但這片攝出乘無異是宣布著書人逐步併吞世界的罪狀，影嚮不小。故即使拍成後，還須等待二次歐戰爆發，方可開映，這時宣示民衆，挑釁者究是何人，有書爲證，無可狡賴。　　在別的方面，影城新有自由思想團體，組織「電影指導社」社員自己出踐，拍攝他們理想之片。第一部開拍的名「野獸擊校」，由伊列格孟女士中演，敘述猶太家庭在德國所遭遇的種種，及意鬥掙扎情形，很有蘇聯作風。該社社員約一千五百餘人，也不全是左傾，只歡喜追求現實。預斜他們的勢力擴大以後，也許把好萊塢一向雜曼的克的作風，完全推翻。工部局華員彩排誌盛  大圭　　工部局華員俱樂部平劇股於三日假座湖社，舉行慈善彩排，售資所得，充作救濟難民經費。該股諸君，可謂己飢己溺，痌　在抱矣。所演劇自，濡筆記之，以覘盛况。　　（一）連環套　筆生花之黃天霸，唸白唱工，平穩無疵，身段尚欠練習。未演拜山，以致楊海峰之爾墩，不克登台。　　（二）狀元譜　季藹雲之伯愚，倪維良之大官，演來均恰到好處。允以倪君之大官，極爲自然。　　（三）燭影記　襲連珍小姐之賀后，一段原板，頓挫有致。三眼中幾個賊好比，亦咬字有勁。姚慈影小姐之匡義，工力悉敵，深爲牡丹綠葉之助。兩小姐均服務工部局衛生股，公餘之暇，研究平劇，得此成績，難能可貴。　　（四）玉堂春　費傑之蘇三，丹田充足，嗓子繞樑。惟身段台步，似少婀娜，良以費君不願作兒女態。何俊德之秉義，談笑風生，語多有刺，做工無過火之處。影星陳依萍現任重慶中國製片廠演員（杜鰲）　　（五）武昭關　陳扭鐘之子胥，老票友自楚不凡。王莉珍小姐之昭儀，板槽工穩，歌喉圓潤，胡琴襯　亦好，宜其彩聲雷動　　（六）法門寺　倪維良之玉姣，票友上蹻，戎伯鉻後所僅見。綉鞋拾鐲諸塲，做工細膩熨貼，描摹小女兒心理，入木三分。蘇撰之之傅朋，一段南梆子，有金仲仁風味。王兆祥之劉媒婆，滑稽突梯，不使人嚴。亞永祿之劉瑾，黃鐘大呂，瓦屋皆震。陳可萍之巧姣，許士偉之趙廉，均票友中之具有天才者。孔繁峰之國士，屈居裏子，好在票友彩排，不爭地位高下。李保琮之贊桂，京白流利淸爽乾净，讀狀一段，一氣呵成，頗非易易。允喜其插科打譚，俯拾即是。如一現在非常時期，一個亭子間要租三十元，呌我那兒出得起」。又如「多買柴米，少看電影」等。予覺票友學戲，丑角較他角爲難，允其是賈桂一角。試觀內行中以此角見長者，不過蕭長華馬宮祿等而已。事前晤及李君，頗以此爲李君憂。蓋平日祇知共擅長話劇，不息上台後應付裕如。始知平劇亦有素養也。票友登台，每易心慌，因此而忘詞，而誤塲『予輒以此詢李君，據謂，上台後對配角視若自家人外，對台下覜衆一概不理，免致分心，然後演劇，方始不亂。此或李君之舞台經驗歟。此劇本代大團國，因時間關係，不及演出，以致李君不能盡展所長，殊爲遺憾。影星陳依萍現任重慶中國製片廠演員  （杜鰲）梨園外紀  徐慕雲　　　家庭多故菊朋幾步大頭後塵遁入空門　　想到遺裹，她才人了產科學校，畢業後算是有了相當的技能啦。她本來很會操持家務，服侍老父，照看幼弟，樣樣全能兼顧周到。不想後來少朋（菊朋長子）受了某少婦的誘惑，年輕輕的又染了嗜好，她父親替他請來老師敎戲，他父不用工練習，每臼淨是化錢遊玩，半點不體諒老父的甘苦。有時她父親要唱「探母」，幾天以前就在地板上舖起棉被窩，穿上厚底靴子，翻來覆去的練習「弔毛」，一面摔着，一面很感慨的說道：「我因是半路出家，沒有幼工，弄到五十歲的人還得煉習這個，旣吃這行飯，又有什麽法子想呢」！伯明在一旁聽着瞧着，實在心裹覺着難過，因此避地裹也認眞規勸了少朋幾决。論起少朋來，原本也不是不長進的孩千聽了姐姐的忠告，自然也有所覺悟，不過那位新寡的少婦，依然時時設法勾引少朋出外，一個方在二十上下的靑年，怎能有拒絕女性誘惑的勇氣呢？况且他二妹慧珠，叉是個不明事理的女孩子，某少婦復利用着她傳達訊息，故而結果，伯明的勸告仍歸無效。先哲會說過父子不責善，責善則離，」伯明自以爲她是長姊，當然有管敎兄弟的權力，其實她一點不明瞭上面那兩句話的意思。她下死功夫去拆散少朋與某少婦的結合，自然他們就聯合一致的反對她，有時少朋慧珠兩人串好啦，在菊朋跟前說他們大姐的壞話，碰着菊朋又是個不辨楚非的糊塗蟲，反倒把大姑娘責備一番，於楚伯明一氣就服了「來沙而」啦。幸虧她把藥瓶拿在手中　時候，早被少朋瞧見，待她冷不防喝入口中這個當兒，少朋在她背後猛然用力一推，她向前一栽，將藥水吐出，雖楚未曾下嚥，然而滿嘴皮肉及舌尖諸處全都燒的稀爛了。——（二九）——棋苑  鮑子波編　陸承鑄校　　第六十六局　抱虎歸山　　倪耀先擬　　紅先勝</p>

<h3>Strengthening the Lineup and Fresh Deployments: Chinese Troops Advancing Towards Qianjiang; Stable Situation on All Fronts Along the Xiang River, Including Jingzhong, Hanyi, and Others; Chinese Side Meeting the Invading Japanese Army with Large-Scale Control</h3>
<p>(Yichang) The Japanese troops invading Tunjiazui and Qianjiang this time, numbering over a thousand combined infantry and artillery, have suffered heavy casualties under the fierce attacks of the Chinese army for days. Only about four hundred remain, entrenched in Qianjiang, occasionally venturing to Yuanjiaqiao to shell the west bank of the Dongjing River. However, they flee as soon as the Chinese army retaliates. Currently, the Chinese army is advancing towards Qianjiang. (Fifth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Laohekou telegraph: The Huayu army's lineup in Hubei and Henan has been strengthened with fresh deployments. The battle situations along the Xiang River and the Jingzhong, Hanyi, and Hua Xiang fronts have been stable for days. The Chinese are using large-scale control tactics to strike the invading Japanese army. Fierce battles have occurred near Tianmen and Jingshan. The Japanese troops invading Qianjiang are still surrounded by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops at the junction of Hebei and Shandong have been largely eliminated. (Sixth morning dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Yesterday, the Japanese troops in the Qianjiang area continuously bombarded the Chinese army positions on the Dongjing River with heavy artillery. Later, the Chinese army crossed the Dongjing River, launched a counteroffensive, and adopted encirclement tactics, attacking from both front and rear. The Japanese army finally gave way and retreated to the east bank of the Han River. However, remnants of Japanese troops remain west of the Han River. The original telegram did not provide details.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Lanchang Incident</h3>
<p>The labor strike at the Lanchang Cotton Mill, owned by British merchants in Pudong, has dragged on for over twenty days, and there is still no news of a resolution. Recently, Lanchang Mill has been advertising in various newspapers, seeking worker-elected representatives for negotiations. We sincerely hope that the sensible and reasonable Lanchang workers can immediately elect representatives to discuss the matter. At the same time, we also hope that the Lanchang authorities can accommodate the workers' demands as much as possible to jointly seek a reasonable resolution to this dispute. Otherwise, the labor strike will continue to drag on, causing great losses to both labor and capital, and it will be a laughingstock to those who stir up trouble. We know that the mill had already announced that it would resume operations on the 29th of last month, and many workers had already prepared to return to the factory. Unexpectedly, a so-called "strike committee" blocked them, threatening those who returned to work, so operations could not resume. Currently, a sinister force has clearly separated labor and capital, and the capitalists cannot find worker representatives to meet and negotiate. This vicious conspiracy should be clearly recognized and deeply reflected upon by both labor and capital in Lanchang.</p>
<p>According to reports, the immediate cause of the strike by two thousand Lanchang workers was the abuse of female workers by a White Russian watchman in the mill. A male worker saw this and spoke out in protest, but was dismissed by the mill. This caused widespread outrage, leading to a collective strike. However, the underlying cause is said to be the mill's reduction of bonuses, which aroused opposition from the workers. Recently, prices have soared, and workers' real wages have decreased by as much as fifty percent. Workers' lives are already struggling under an unbearable burden, and the reduction of bonuses has further deepened widespread dissatisfaction. When the dispute first occurred, it is said that the workers were able to consider the overall situation and elected representatives to negotiate with the mill. However, the mill refused, at which time troublemakers mixed into the mill took the opportunity to incite unrest, creating chaos throughout the mill, and the mill had no choice but to announce the suspension of operations.</p>
<p>Some people with "schadenfreude" seized this opportunity to loudly stir up an anti-British movement. On one hand, they organized a so-called "strike committee" to isolate labor and capital. On the other hand, they tried to bribe and entice workers with sweet words. Fortunately, most of the workers understood the bigger picture and were unwilling to sell themselves to be used as propaganda tools. Now, most of the workers realize that they do not want to escalate the situation, and the mill also hopes to negotiate a resolution with the workers. However, because of the obstruction of this sinister force, the Lanchang Mill has not been able to resume operations to this day.</p>
<p>The Lanchang incident was initially just a local issue, but its subsequent evolution has taken on greater significance. Frankly speaking, the entire industry and commerce of Shanghai is linked to the common interests of all countries, and is a thorn in the side of those who seek to monopolize the Shanghai market. This is true for British merchants, and it is also true for merchants from other countries. Their strategy is to use traitorous elements to infiltrate and disrupt enterprises, and then use the guise of "protecting workers' interests" to incite strikes, leading to factory closures and unemployment. In this way, they can profit from it, seizing both the market and the labor force needed for the market. This Lanchang incident makes this clear to everyone. Therefore, from now on, labor and capital in Shanghai should work together to achieve their practical cooperation and realize that labor and capital are not opposed to each other.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the workers of Shanghai have indeed shown an unprecedented spirit of self-awareness. They have been able to consider the overall situation and endure everything under the difficult living conditions of high prices and declining wages. This spirit is truly worthy of our admiration. Although some of the capitalists in Shanghai have already achieved preliminary cooperation with labor, most still have a large gap with labor, refusing to accept reasonable demands from labor and refusing to improve the lives of workers. For example, the Lanchang incident may have been caused by this gap. It is said that the Lanchang Mill could earn over ten thousand yuan a day when it was operating, and it must lose over twenty thousand yuan a day after the suspension of operations. To recover the loss of over thirty thousand yuan a day, it is worthwhile for the Lanchang authorities to make some concessions to labor. Therefore, from now on, the capitalists in Shanghai should take the lives of workers into account as much as possible and maintain harmonious cooperation between labor and capital, which today is equivalent to protecting their own interests.</p>
<p>As for labor, from now on, it should also clearly recognize the overall situation and not mistake the current target. It is also necessary to strengthen its own organization to prevent traitorous elements from taking the opportunity to infiltrate, disrupt, and incite. It should be known that in today's pressing national crisis, class consciousness should be completely abandoned.</p>

<h3>New Clashes Near Zhanggufeng: News Reported by Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Hunchun and other places in Japanese newspapers, new clashes have recently occurred on the border between Siberia and "Manchukuo."

<h3>Foreign Correspondents Inspect the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia Border: All is Quiet</h3>
<p>Hailar, Reuters: After inspecting the "front lines" of the Halha River ("Qian Qian"), a special correspondent for Reuters returned here today. While at the Japanese division headquarters near the "front lines," they overheard Japanese officials say that the total number of planes shot down by the Japanese in the recent air battles near the "Manchukuo"-Outer Mongolia border has increased from 59 to 62. The Japanese side claimed their overwhelming aerial victory has been "fully confirmed." Many Outer Mongolian planes crashed within "Manchukuo," but in the numerous air battles, the Japanese only lost one plane. The 62nd Outer Mongolian plane was shot down on June 2nd by Sergeant Saito, who is a "skilled pilot" for the Japanese. In a recent operation, he single-handedly attacked 28 Outer Mongolian planes. The headquarters also stated that the vast disparity in losses between Outer Mongolia and "Japan" (62 to 1) was due to "the enemy's low morale and poor flying skills." The Reuters correspondent traveled to the "front lines" of the Nomonhan area and saw an endless plain, but everything was quiet. Even with powerful binoculars, they could not see any trace of Outer Mongolian troops. It was reported that since Sergeant Saito shot down the 62nd enemy plane on June 2nd, there have been no more air battles. The Japanese had previously claimed to have shot down 17 enemy planes on May 27th and another 42 on May 29th. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Declares: The Real Enemy is the Concession within China's Borders: "The Concession Issue Must be Resolved First, With Full Power to Dispose of Them at Will"</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Miyako Shinbun stated: "After fighting in China for two years, we have come to understand the true nature of the China Incident. The only way to resolve the China Incident is to deal effectively with the foreign powers that aid the Chinese government. The true intentions of these countries have been fully revealed in their attitude towards the concessions in China. The landing of British, American, and French armed forces on Gulangyu to demonstrate against Japan has undoubtedly disclosed the nature of their policy towards the China Incident. Britain, America, and France are determined to help China resist Japan, no less than the Soviet Union is active on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border. British, American, and French aid to China is based in the concessions in China. If this is not eliminated, the China Incident will never end. Japan's real enemy is not China, but the concessions within China. This is the central nervous system of the resistance against Japan, as 80% of the military supplies used by China come from the concessions. If we want to overthrow the Chinese government, we must first resolve the problem of the concessions in China. As a belligerent, we have full power to dispose of the public concessions at will."

<h3>Refugees to Hong Kong Arriving in a Continuous Stream</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The refugee problem in Hong Kong has become increasingly serious. Therefore, future relief measures should be limited to those that are constructive. Chinese refugees are arriving in Hong Kong in a continuous stream, and relief funds are very limited. Therefore, merely providing refugees with food, clothing, and shelter is not a long-term solution. As a result, some propose finding ways for these people to support themselves and using relief funds as capital for production. Since the promotion of the cooperative movement in mainland China has yielded excellent results, Hong Kong can follow suit. Furthermore, the "South China Morning Post" today advocated for the implementation of a cooperative movement within Hong Kong. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>

Britain and France are currently exchanging opinions. French Ambassador to Britain Couseau, who had just returned from Paris, met with Foreign Secretary Halifax this morning to discuss this matter.

Pope Pius XII is deeply concerned that the conclusion of this agreement will allow the Bolsheviks to interfere in European affairs. At the same time, the Vatican is working to promote an international peace conference, hoping that France, Germany, Italy, and Poland can prioritize peace over their own real interests before a democratic country concludes an agreement with the Soviet Union."

<p>(London) According to messages in this morning's newspapers, the Pope is about to send another message to Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, calling for peace. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express both say that this new appeal is related to the proposed Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance, as the Pope fears its completion would facilitate the intrusion of communism into Europe. According to the News Chronicle, the Pope's appeal will be sent to countries including the United States, Belgium, and South American nations. It is said that the Pope has not abandoned his efforts to persuade all countries to allow Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to resolve disputes. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the news reported in the British newspapers that the Pope is planning to send another appeal for peace to various countries, sources at the Vatican said that the Pope has not taken any new actions since delivering his address to the College of Bishops on June 2nd. However, the Pope will continue to pursue diplomatic activities through normal channels. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail recently published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent stating that Pope Pius XII will suggest to the governments of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland that a conference be held to discuss and resolve various outstanding European issues.

<p>Soviet Army Chief Declines Invitation to Visit Britain</p>
<p>(Moscow) The British Army General Staff recently invited Soviet People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov to visit Britain in September to observe army exercises. According to reliable sources, General Voroshilov has politely declined, saying that the Soviet Army will also be holding exercises at that time and he will be unable to attend. He will send several generals as representatives to observe. Foreign observers here have commented that members of the Politburo of the Soviet Communist Party rarely travel abroad unless there are special circumstances. General Voroshilov is also a member and only traveled to Turkey in 1933 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the republic. This refusal of the British invitation is unlikely to have any connection to the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Rumors of Soviet Union Purchasing Huge Ships from Britain</p>
<p>(Moscow) Representatives from the British Vickers arms factory have recently been here to negotiate with the Soviet government. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has ordered huge ships from the factory, with engines worth between £750,000 and £1 million. However, this rumor cannot be confirmed at this time. In addition, various American arms factories have also sent representatives to station here to sell machinery for refining steel plates. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Germany Actively Engaged in Diplomatic Activities</p>
<p>(Berlin) On April 28th, the German government announced the abolition of both the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. At the same time, the country's newspapers used sarcastic language to describe the negotiations being conducted by Britain with Turkey and the Soviet Union as "alliance sickness." By now, Germany itself seems to have contracted this disease. In March, the country signed an agreement with Lithuania, recovering the Memel region and agreeing not to use force against each other. Since then, it has sought to conclude non-aggression pacts with the Baltic states and the Scandinavian peninsula. Among them, negotiations with Denmark have been completed. Negotiations with Estonia and Latvia were supposed to have concluded half a month ago, but these countries are now wary of the Soviet Union's attitude. As for Yugoslavia, Prince Regent Paul is currently visiting here, and his entourage says that Yugoslavia does not intend to sign any treaties with Germany, has no intention of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, and does not want to conclude an agreement with Hungary, so as not to hinder Yugoslavia's friendship with Romania. According to informed sources, Germany is actively engaged in diplomatic activities with Spain. Germany has stated that if Britain and the Soviet Union reach an agreement, the German-Italian axis will definitely respond. Regarding this, political figures believe that merely strengthening ties with Japan is not enough, and it is necessary to bring Spain into a military alliance treaty to be the best outcome.

<h3>Japanese Five-Minister Conference: Passing Basic Policies for Addressing the European Situation</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: Japan's basic policies in the face of the new European situation have been passed by the Five-Minister Conference this morning. Prime Minister Hiranuma is scheduled to enter the Imperial Palace this afternoon to report everything to the Emperor. Hiranuma was originally at his villa in Yono, taking a weekend break. He returned here today and immediately summoned the Ministers of the Army and Navy to continue the discussions from last Saturday, hold discussions on Japan's basic policies, and make a decision. After a decision was reached, the Prime Minister separately summoned Foreign Minister Arita and Finance Minister Ishiwata for discussions, resulting in a final decision. Hiranuma entered the Imperial Palace this afternoon to report everything. Also, Konoe visited Elder Statesman Saionji at his villa this morning to report on Japan's domestic and foreign situation over the past twelve months, including Japan's policies in the new European situation. The two men also freely exchanged opinions on the latter. (Dispatch, 5th)</p>

It is generally believed that Japan's future foreign policy will be based on the proposals of the Army and Navy Ministers. (Haitong dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Air Force: Formidable Strength</h3>
<p>(London) The increase in the production of British aircraft is rapid, to the point that the storage of manufactured aircraft has become a problem. The Air Force already possesses a large number of the latest aircraft to handle missions with ample surplus. Experts estimate that the British Air Force's strength was quite weak last September, but this has completely changed. If an aggressor country sends aircraft to bomb major British cities, 80% of them will be shot down, and only 20% will be able to fly back to their home country. There are two reasons for this: 1. The quality of new British fighter planes is excellent, and their speed is far superior to that of fighter planes from other countries. 2. Britain has manufactured a large number of anti-aircraft guns, which are capable of defending London. It is expected that the density of their firepower will prevent enemy aircraft from observing. Similar protection can be obtained in other major cities within a short period of time. Military authorities are currently drafting plans to station a large number of new aircraft at key strategic locations in the empire, so that they can effectively occupy an advantageous position in the sky. In addition, the metal used in British aircraft manufacturing is of excellent quality, and the durability of the aircraft is five or six times greater than that of products from Germany and Italy. This is another reason why the British Air Force has an advantage. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Reportedly to Be Replaced</h3>
<p>(Washington) Rumors continue to circulate here today that U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy will succeed Swanson as Secretary of the Navy. Secretary Swanson is 77 years old and currently in poor health and will retire soon. It was previously rumored that Assistant Secretary of the Navy Edison would take Secretary Swanson's position, but this did not materialize due to poor health. Secretary Swanson has not been to the office for the past few months and the duties of the department have been handled by Admiral Leahy and Edison. President Roosevelt has also participated in the recent U.S. naval expansion plan. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Preparations Complete for U.S. Hospitality to British Monarch</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news here today, all arrangements for welcoming the British King and Queen have been completed. The procedures for hosting the British King and Queen have been finalized by the U.S. government in conjunction with officials from the British Embassy in the United States. U.S. Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay, as well as officials from both sides on the welcome committee, are scheduled to depart tomorrow for Buffalo to welcome the British King and Queen to the United States. The last day the British King and Queen will be here is June 11th. After this, the British King and Queen will return to Canada. During this period, the main task of the U.S. government is to wholeheartedly host the British King and Queen and strengthen the friendly relations between the United States and Britain. It is rumored that the British King and Queen will reside at Roosevelt's private residence, Hyde Park. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Czech Intellectual Class Suppressed: Scholar Framed to Serve as a Warning</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Droite Hebdo reports that a prominent Czech political commentator, Dr. Sejanina, who served as a judge in the Higher Court of Brno, defended the suspect Lubbe, along with many foreign lawyers, when the trial of the burning of the German Reichstag in 1933 was opened. German authorities now intend to file a public lawsuit accusing him of conspiring to assassinate leading figures of the National Socialist Party (Nazi Party) to punish him. The background of this lawsuit may remind people of the opening of the trial for burning the German Reichstag. The National Socialist Party now wants to use one of the lawyers in that case as the main defendant. Although this is a coincidence, its purpose is because this person is a Czech patriotic activist, a progressive member of the intellectual community, and a representative of the humanitarian spirit promoted by the late Czech President Masaryk. If he can be punished, it will serve as a warning to others. German political police are employing their usual tactics to fabricate evidence to accuse Dr. Sejanina. However, the identity of the National Socialist Party official whom this person allegedly plotted to harm, whether it is Hitler or Aviation Minister General Goering, has not been clarified. The identity of the conspirators and the total number of conspirators are also unknown. In short, the goal of this case is to divert the German people's attention so that they do not pay attention to current domestic policies. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Revival of Moral Values Congress: President Roosevelt Sends Letter of Support</h3>
<p>(Washington) British figures, such as former Prime Minister Lord Baldwin and famous tennis player Austin, initiated a moral revival movement last year, calling on world public opinion to oppose war. The method they advocated was not to use pacifism, but to resist war with a strong attitude and resolute will. Various circles in the United States responded to this call yesterday and held a conference here. Letters and telegrams were sent by 206 people from the United States and abroad, all of which were read by the chairman. One of President Roosevelt's letters stated: "The moral essence of the people of all countries in the world is the source of strength for the whole world. The moral revival plan promoted by your association can reduce the danger of war, but it must be supported by the whole world to be effective." (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Election Situation: Roosevelt's Candidacy Undecided</h3>
<p>(New York) The U.S. election is scheduled for November of next year. The preliminary stages of the election will begin in March, when the Democratic and Republican parties will each select delegates to their national conventions. These conventions will then nominate candidates for the general election. In this upcoming election, which candidate from the Democratic and Republican parties has a chance of winning remains highly uncertain. First, regarding the Democratic Party, President Roosevelt has yet to indicate whether he will seek a third term. According to U.S. custom, a president is only allowed to serve two terms. Citing this precedent, the political opponents of President Roosevelt are opposing his running for a third term, arguing that it would lead to the development of "personal authority," which is undesirable. However, those within the government argue that President Roosevelt is the originator of the "New Deal" and that its continued implementation requires him. The core of the "New Deal" is based on labor-management cooperation, and even the Republican Party cannot disregard it. Furthermore, President Roosevelt's foreign policy takes into account historical traditions and the global situation, past and future. It is considered perfect and cannot be criticized or abandoned by the Republican Party. Therefore, it is argued that President Roosevelt must run for a third term. However, after eight years in office, it is impossible to know whether the president will consider retirement. As for the Republican Party, potential candidates either lack prestige or political experience. Dewey, the New York State prosecutor, gained fame from the Hines case (Hines, a prominent Democrat, was arrested last year for illegally issuing lottery tickets using political influence) and is considered promising, but lacks political experience. Additionally, Senators Taft of Ohio and Vandenberg of Michigan are also potential Republican candidates. However, if President Roosevelt decides to run for a third term, the Republican Party must nominate a candidate of comparable stature and, in addition to criticizing the current government's policies, "must also propose a positive and practical platform" to be competitive.

<h3>Britain Holds Memorials for Submarine Disaster; Churches and Schools Hold Prayers</h3>
<p>(London) Today, the nation mourns the 97 lives lost on the submarine Thetis. Special prayers are being held in cathedrals, parish churches, and on warships across the country. Admiral Forbes, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, has issued a call to 30,000 naval personnel to participate in special memorial services on ships in Portland and at naval land institutions. Those who participated in the attempted rescue of the crew members are holding a brief religious service at the site where Thetis sank. It has been announced that the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Bowater, will launch a London City Council relief fund on June 6 on behalf of the victims' families. The King has sent a telegram to the First Lord of the Admiralty, Earl Stanhope, expressing condolences for the Thetis disaster. Queen Mary has also sent a telegram to comfort the relatives of the victims. Foreign leaders have also sent condolences, including Hitler. On Monday, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, Shakespeare, will present the details of this tragedy in the House of Commons. The nation is waiting with deep concern for the results of the Admiralty's inquiry. It is said that among the 99 victims were the country's best submarine design and construction experts. It has been announced that it will take some time to bring the submarine to the surface. The current attempt is to use floating docks to bring the submarine to a level position and then tow it to a nearby shallow area, or possibly aground on Anglesey beach. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today the cause of the sinking of the new submarine Thetis, saying it was due to water flooding the forward two compartments. The submarine's signaling equipment was destroyed, preventing communication with surface ships. Although smoke signals were sent, they were not immediately detected. A detailed investigation into this tragedy will be conducted publicly. It is not possible to predict when the submarine can be raised. The Prime Minister then expressed the government and the House's condolences for the loss of many useful lives and offered comfort to the families of the deceased. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>French Government's Policies Supported by Radical Socialists</h3>
<p>(Paris) The executive committee of the Radical Socialist Party, the ruling party, unanimously passed a resolution expressing support for the current government's domestic and foreign policies. The speech given by party leader Daladier was also warmly praised by the committee members. He stated that France is determined to resist the aggression, coercion, and arbitrary self-sufficiency, the agitation of hot-headed ideas, and the demands made under the pretext of vital space. The committee members approved of this declaration. Deputy Party Chairman Mistral also gave a speech stating, "The mutual assistance agreements signed by Britain and France with certain countries are defensive in nature, showing that we have no intention of encircling Germany. If Germany wants to conduct economic negotiations with democratic countries, it must first recognize that the era of force is over. As for the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the common goal is to establish a genuine, equal, and mutually beneficial assistance agreement. It is hoped that the Soviet Union will show a spirit of compromise so that success can be achieved soon." (Havas dispatch, date unclear)</p>
<h3>Germans in Yugoslavia Oppose Land Purchase Restrictions; German Foreign Minister Fetes Yugoslav Regent</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia German residents in Yugoslavia have been extensively purchasing land in the Sava and Danube River regions near the border. The Yugoslav military authorities are concerned that this is at the instigation of the German government, with the intention of creating so-called "vital space" as a foundation for future expansion. The government has therefore determined regulations to restrict this. German leaders have risen up in opposition and petitioned the government. The government authorities have now promised to revise the restrictions or even abolish them. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Germany Demands Release of Czech Gold Stored in London; Majority of British MPs Oppose Delivery</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons will reconvene tomorrow, and the issue of Germany's demand for the release of Czech gold stored in London will be discussed. Political figures are studying this issue. According to financial authorities, there are two batches of Czech gold. The first batch, worth £5 million, belongs to the Czech National Bank and was deposited in London through the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) at the end of March. It was then taken by the Czech National Bank to Prague, where it fell into German hands. The second batch, worth £6.5 million, was directly deposited in London by the Czech National Bank and has been seized by the British government under a law passed by Parliament. Germany is demanding this batch. Representatives from Britain and Germany have already held negotiations, but without success. The British argument is that since the Czech National Bank is the direct successor to the Czech state, the gold should be used to offset Czech claims held within the country. This is seen as a way to avoid recognizing the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The German side argues that the Czech National Bank is independent, and using its deposits to pay off the debts of the former Czech state is illegal. Since the first batch of gold was handed over to the Czech National Bank, a majority of MPs have opposed it. If the second batch of gold is released, opposition will be even stronger, potentially threatening the government's position. Therefore, it is unlikely that Britain and Germany can continue negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon repeated in the House of Commons today about the Czech gold held by the Bank of England, saying that he had consulted legal experts, who all advised the British government not to take any action to prevent the Bank of England from complying with the instructions of its client, the Bank for International Settlements, to hand over the gold to the designated party. If the Treasury does not allow the transfer, it would be violating treaty obligations, and the Treasury cannot obtain a court ruling that it has the right to prevent the Bank of England from complying with the order.

<h3>Mexico Fire Kills 70</h3>
<p>Mexico City A movie theater in the village of Chiatla de Tapia, Morelos province, suddenly caught fire tonight. Due to the flammable building materials, the entire theater was destroyed within seven minutes. There were 800 people in the theater at the time. Upon hearing the fire alarm, everyone tried to escape, resulting in trampling and deaths, mostly children. The situation was tragic. The fire spread rapidly, affecting 30 farmhouses in the village. The security team stationed at a nearby sugar factory claimed they had not received orders to leave the factory and stood by without helping. By the time the fire brigade arrived, it was too late. The military and police gradually arrived and worked with the fire brigade to put out the fire, saving the remaining houses. An investigation revealed that 70 people died in the fire, and 150 were injured. It was a disaster. (Havas dispatch, date unclear)</p>

<h3>Under Japanese Military Aggression, North China Forms Two Areas; Chinese and Japanese Armies Each Control Their Own Territory; But It Is Extremely Difficult for the Japanese Army to Eliminate Guerrillas; Vast Plains Are Held by Guerrillas</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao's May 15th Beijing dispatch states that many people in Chinese towns, whose real homes and families are in inland villages, must have lost contact with their families. North China has been clearly divided into two areas, with no communication between them. One side is the towns occupied by the Japanese military and the surrounding small rural areas, connected by narrow railways. The other side is the vast inland area, most of which has not been ravaged by aggressors and is still under Chinese control. Now, the Japanese authorities often dislike it when people want to go inland, and it is not easy to make the trip, because between the two areas, there is often a "no-man's land," continuously made up of burnt or destroyed villages, and guerrillas who are not bound by either side stay there. Therefore, it is now difficult to find out the situation in the inland areas. Only by occasionally meeting some missionaries who live inland, or a small number of Chinese intellectuals who try to sneak back into the occupied areas, can we get a glimpse of the inland situation. Now, the current situation of the areas controlled by the Chinese and Japanese in North China (northeast of the Yellow River) is outlined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Inner Mongolia is somewhat under Japanese military control, but the Japanese have not tried to properly garrison it.</p>
<p>(2) Suiyuan The railway, and the towns along the road, and the narrow strip of land, are all in the hands of the Japanese army, but the countryside south of the railway line, and the vast area west of Baotou, the end station of the line, are still held by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>(3) Chahar The northern area outside the Great Wall and the narrow strip of land along the Pingzhang Railway are under Japanese military control.</p>
<p>(4) Shanxi After three long and strenuous efforts to expel the guerrillas, the central plateau, the west and south of Taiyuan, and the narrow strip of land along the narrow-gauge Tongpu Railway, all the way to the Yellow River, are now in the hands of the Japanese army. The rest of the province is still under the control of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>(5) Hebei The east (that is, what is called Jidong), between the Beining Railway and the Great Wall, is still called quiet (remember that before July 1937, this area was already in the hands of the Japanese army). In the central part, the Japanese army has proclaimed that it has "eliminated" the guerrillas as far as halfway to the Yellow River.</p>
<p>(6) Shandong The area connecting the two railways, and north of the Yellow River, is still called quiet, but the mountainous areas and cape areas in the central part of the province are still in the hands of the Chinese army. Even in the area along the railway, where Japanese troops are stationed, it often presents an unstable situation. Many important railway lines are still far from being tranquil, and the railway lines that go deep inland can only be used for military purposes.</p>
<p>Railway Lines and Mining Areas</p>
<p>The Pinghan Line has been repeatedly attacked and destroyed, as has the Pingsui Road between Zhangjiakou and Suiyuan. The damage to the Pingsui Road line is so severe that trains have not been running for several weeks. The Datong Coal Mine on the Pingsui Road in northern Shanxi has been damaged in recent weeks and cannot operate, as is the Tuoli Coal Mine in Xishan, not far from Peiping. There have been repeated reports of the destruction of trains, resulting in a shortage of trains, which are not even enough to meet the drastically reduced passenger and freight services in these areas. Given this situation, it is not surprising that the Japanese have occupied North China for almost two years and still cannot carry out economic development.</p>
<p>The Largest Independent Area</p>
<p>The largest independent area of the Chinese side is in the vast mountainous area west of the Pinghan Road, containing parts of the provinces of Jin, Sui, Cha, and Ji, forming a strong area with a population of 14 million. This area once included the entire central Hebei. At the beginning of the Japanese invasion in 1937, most of the local governments were destroyed. In the period after the Japanese army retreated or passed through, the administration was in complete chaos. In early 1938, representatives from areas not directly occupied by the Japanese army held a meeting in Fuping, a small town west of Baoding near the border of Jin, to organize what they called a district government to take over the administrative power of the areas that could still be independent. This is a mobile government, operating in a way that is suitable for dealing with frequent attacks by the Japanese army. For half a year, the government had time to consolidate its position and gradually restore order in various counties. Last November, a large number of Japanese reinforcements arrived in North China, and from the east and the south, that is, the Pinghan Road and the Jinpu Road, they launched a large-scale invasion to eliminate central Hebei. After repeated battles, lasting five months, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses before occupying towns as far as halfway to the south bank of the Yellow River. Later, because it was discovered that their system of invading and then retreating did not achieve satisfactory results, they decided to change their method and began to garrison larger towns in central Hebei. For this reason, 50,000 reinforcements continued to arrive in North China in March and April, and immediately poured into a vast area, but the area was vast and the troops were few, so they still felt that the distribution was insufficient. Therefore, even with reinforcements, it cannot be said that central Hebei has been effectively occupied. The guerrillas still hold the countryside and hide in thousands of villages scattered like stars across the vast plain. Because the guerrillas had demolished the walls of most towns before leaving, the Japanese army had to guard behind barbed wire obstacles and showed an unstable appearance, and had no power in the surrounding areas. Even if the Japanese army has occupied a city, it has no confidence in "pacifying" the countryside, because it is becoming increasingly difficult to find people to carry out any kind of local administration. When the Japanese army approaches a city, the people are ordered to leave the city, and only hooligans stay behind to work under the command of the Japanese army. This is a dangerous job, because if they are caught by the guerrillas, they will be executed by shooting. The farmers in the surrounding areas no longer bring agricultural products into the already barren cities, so the Japanese army has to transport all supplies by truck from the nearest railway station. The guerrillas have dug trenches six feet deep across the roads, greatly hindering truck transportation. The supply of raw cotton, one of the purposes of the Japanese invasion of North China, has also become a fantasy, because the guerrillas have advised farmers not to plant cotton anymore, so the output is said to have decreased by 80%. According to the current policy, it is difficult to understand how the Japanese army can hope to establish an effective administrative body to handle affairs in the entire North China region and restore peace and order in the interior. The actions that the Japanese army had previously taken, and are still continuing to take in other parts of the interior, to attack and destroy villages, and blame the guerrillas, can only increase the chaos, force more people to join the team, and greatly increase the difficulty of supplying and transporting the Japanese army. The recent plan to garrison all the occupied towns in the interior, if properly garrisoned, may be more effective, but it is more useless and worse to do so with insufficient military strength. In any case, the Japanese army has still not been able to occupy the vast mountainous areas. Some experts believe that the Japanese army needs to redeploy at least 500,000 people to begin to eliminate North China, but the Japanese army seems unwilling to do so, so it is difficult to predict when and how the Japanese army will be able to complete this task. After the matter is completed, they will return to Japanese warships.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers from Daishan Go to Changtu Island to Search; After the Matter Is Completed, They Return to Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>Dinghai Communication Changtu Island, which belongs to the county, is located east of Daishan. It was landed on by Japanese soldiers in January last year, and they did not withdraw until March. After the Japanese army landed on Daishan on the 22nd of last month, Japanese warships also came to Changtu to spy on the island from time to time. At about 9:00 a.m. on the 27th, two Japanese warships from Daishan arrived again. They launched four motorboats, carrying more than 80 Japanese soldiers, and landed on the shore in droves in the area of ​​Waijingtou Dinghai Bay. More than 40 Japanese soldiers landed at Niangjigong Shengdoushan Zhengyimiao, and successively searched villages in the area of ​​Shangxia Street. They did not withdraw and return to the warships until the evening.</p>
<h3>Japanese Lieutenant General Commander Iwamatsu Is Wounded by the Chinese Army; Iwamatsu Was Assassinated on the Way to Yangzhou; The Bullet Hit His Chest and His Injuries Were Very Serious</h3>
<p>Taixian Communication Japanese Lieutenant General Commander Iwamatsu was shot in the chest with a pistol by a Chinese plainclothes guerrilla on May 25 when he went to Yangzhou to inspect the Guazhou ferry crossing. His injuries were very serious. He was sent to Shanghai for treatment on a special train. The guerrilla retreated safely after completing his mission.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Is Desperate; The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu Has a Huge Momentum; Yu and Gu's Troops Total 200,000; A Siege of Xuzhou Has Already Been Formed; The Japanese Army's Demonstration Was Just a Paper Tiger</h3>
<p>Xinghua Communication There are now more than 200,000 Chinese troops in northern Jiangsu, one-third of whom are the Yan Zhao warriors of Yu Xuezhong's troops, distributed in the counties of Pi, Pei, Feng, Dang, Xiao, Guanyun, Suqian, etc. on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong, forming a large encirclement of Xuzhou. One-third are the troops of Gu Zhutong, that is, the basic troops of the commander of the Jiangsu-Shandong Border Region and the Jiangsu Provincial Security Office, half of whom are from other provinces and half of whom are natives. Because Gu has too many important positions, the actual person in charge of this aspect is the acting chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Han Deqin. Their distribution area is in the counties of Funing, Huai'an, Yancheng, Xinghua, Dongtai, Gaoyou, Taixian, Taixing, etc., and the countryside of the counties of Yang, Ru, Tong, Hai, Chong, and Jing. The remaining one-third are completely local strong men's teams from various counties. Although their weapons and organization are not as good as regular troops, their enthusiasm for protecting their hometown is extremely high, but they lack political training, so this real popular force cannot fully exert its effectiveness, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Because these more than 200,000 troops are protecting northern Jiangsu, the Japanese cannot plunder materials at will like they do in the counties of Suzhou and Wuxi. On the contrary, in the county towns of Xuzhou, Yangzhou, Tongzhou, Jingjiang, etc., which the Japanese army can occupy, they not only dare not take a step out of the city, but are also as panicked as if they were "living from hand to mouth." They have absolutely no chance to rest from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day. Perhaps because they feel that their numbers are small, they follow the orders of their superiors hiding in the cellar and run aimlessly on the streets every day. It is said that this is to show that their strength is not weak. In fact, because of the small number of soldiers, in the past, there were many "cannons" wrapped in oilcloth and hundreds of thousands of "ammunition boxes"夹着 in each marching team, which seemed like "sufficient equipment and ammunition." But now these "paper tigers" have been pierced through. This happened in mid-April. When the Japanese army was flaunting its power, the Chinese army used lightning-fast surprise tactics to smash them to pieces and flee in all directions. In addition to some usable baggage, what was left behind was that the so-called "cannons" were actually model wooden "cannons" from the exhibition, and what was装 in the boxes were broken tiles and rubble. From this, we can see the Japanese army's desperate situation.</p>
<h3>Dongting Mountain Loquats; Heavy Taxes and Difficult Transactions; Traffic Blocked, Cannot Be Transported Out</h3>
<p>Suzhou Communication The eastern and western mountains of Dongting, which belong to the county, are suitable for planting fruit trees due to the soil quality, so the annual output of fruits is very large. Most of the people in the two mountains rely on this income to make a living. Among them, loquats are the best, with white sand being the best. This year's loquats in the two mountains, thanks to the mild climate and harmonious rainfall, are full of golden trees and bear a lot of fruit. After the farmers pick them, they load them into boats to the city, trying to transport them to various places for sale, intending to use the surplus from the harvest to make up for the losses caused by the Japanese bombing the previous year. But things did not go as they wished, and the heavy taxes imposed by the puppet county government greatly raised the price, making it difficult for ordinary buyers to trade. Also, because traffic is blocked everywhere, they cannot be transported out to meet the market. Therefore, a large number of loquat boats are still搁置 at the Shuimenwai Wharf in this county, and the farmers in the two mountains are anxiously due to the heavy taxes imposed by the puppet county government.</p>
<h3>"Seeking Fortune" Steamer Searched by Japanese Warship Outside Zhenhai Port</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Ningbo: The German-owned "Seeking Fortune" steamer of the "He Yang" shipping company, departed from Shanghai for Ningbo on the 27th of last month. When raising anchor, it was thoroughly inspected by a Japanese customs officer and Japanese marine patrol officer from the Jianghai Customs. This took a very long time before the vessel was allowed to proceed. On the 28th, around 4 PM, when it arrived near Qili Island outside Zhenhai Port, it was again encountered by a Japanese warship. The warship used signal lights to order the steamer to stop for inspection. Subsequently, five soldiers boarded the vessel for another search, questioning the crew in detail. Because the steamer was German-owned and carrying only a small amount of relief grain, without any passengers, the Japanese soldiers found no reason to remain and returned to their ship.</p>
<h3>Opening of Spring Cocoon Market in Suzhou and Wuxi, Prohibition of Resale to Foreign Merchants by the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>Correspondent from Wuxi: The cocoon markets in Suzhou, Wuxi, Chengwu, and other counties have mostly opened. This year, there are many sericulture farmers in the countryside. The weather has also been favorable, and the silkworms are developing very well. Unfortunately, they are affected by the high price of mulberry leaves, leading to insufficient feed or the discarding of leaves in the fields. The highest price for cocoons is eighty yuan. Suzhou cocoon merchants consider the cocoons from Guangfu in Dongting Mountain and Xishan to be the best. Wuxian cocoon merchants, considering the cocoon prices to be too high, have sent representatives, including Xu Haoran, to the puppet regime to request further price reductions. The puppet regime claims that due to soaring silk prices, cocoon merchants collecting cocoons in the interior must adhere to their regulations, limiting purchases to those who spin silk for their own use. Otherwise, all hiring or entrusting purchases at cocoon markets is prohibited. If cocoons are later sold to foreign merchants, their business will be suspended. Although there are no problems for cocoon merchants collecting goods within guerrilla areas in villages and towns, obstacles arise when transporting goods through Japanese and puppet-controlled port cities. The puppet regime's prohibition is intended to increase its revenue. Cocoon merchants are currently devising countermeasures. If calculated based on cost, silk prices will inevitably be high in the future, and the increased cost of raw materials for silk fabrics will also lead to price increases.</p>
<h3>Glorious Battle Record of Feng Denggao</h3>
<p>A soldier named Feng Denggao from a certain cavalry division fought a glorious battle against the Japanese army in Suiyuan. The details of his defense in the battle of Xiachenwan in Qingshuihe are as follows: On the 27th of last month, a certain division engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in Xiangshuba, Qingshuihe. Feng Denggao, a private first class from the communication platoon of a certain regiment, was ordered to retreat. On the afternoon of the 28th, while resting in Xiachenwan village by the river, he discovered Japanese cavalry invading from the east. The villagers scattered in all directions, but Feng remained alone in the village. He aimed and shot at six Japanese cavalrymen, killing three of them. A large force of two or three hundred Japanese soldiers, stationed at Taierliang four or five li away from Xiachenwan, were obstructed by the forward patrol. They immediately occupied the mountain peaks and fired machine guns and small cannons at Xiachenwan. Feng continuously returned fire and changed direction to confuse the Japanese. Later, the Japanese army realized there was no large force in Xiachenwan and surrounded the village. Fortunately, a certain regiment of the Suiyuan Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Army arrived to provide assistance, and the Japanese army retreated. In this battle, Feng killed several Japanese soldiers and caused the Japanese army to expend a large amount of ammunition. Feng himself fought hard for a day, and only his trouser legs were pierced by two bullets. Feng is from Fan County, Shandong Province, and is twenty-six years old.</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Activities Near Wusong, Japanese Army Bombards Wusong, Lasting Twenty Minutes, "Yihe" Steamer Reportedly Attacked by Gunfire Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>The "Continental News" reports: It has been learned that yesterday (the 4th) from 10:00 AM to noon, the Japanese army in Wusong bombarded the area, with artillery fire directed towards Puxiyuan (transliteration), a small village nine li west of Wusong. Yesterday afternoon, the "Yihe" steamer of Jardine Matheson returned here from Qidong, confirming the sound of artillery fire. According to several crew members of the "Yihe" steamer, shortly after 10:00 AM yesterday, the steamer was anchored outside Wusong when it received a notification from the Jardine Matheson company here about which wharf to dock at. For twenty minutes, they clearly heard twelve to fifteen heavy artillery shells, clearly aimed at Puxiyuan. Observers here firmly believe that there are strong Chinese guerrilla forces in Puxiyuan and its suburbs, which have recently been actively attacking the Japanese army. Several Chinese warships previously seized by the Japanese army were piloted by Japanese crew members and docked in Qidong yesterday, for unknown reasons, causing slight panic among the people of Qidong. As a result, there were fewer passengers and goods coming to Shanghai yesterday. News received here on Saturday and Sunday nights claimed that the "Yihe" steamer was attacked by gunfire from the Japanese army or the Chinese side. This claim was denied by the crew members of the steamer. It is believed that because the "Yihe" steamer was near the bombardment site in Wusong, and it was reported that the area was once not very peaceful, it led to the rumor that the "Yihe" steamer was attacked. Another report states that since the occupation of Wusong, the Japanese army has planned to use it as a base for military rest and recuperation. Therefore, many wooden barracks have been built at Paotaiwan, Zhanghuabang, Tongji University, and other places. After the start of the war, Songzhen often had ten to twenty thousand or several thousand Japanese soldiers residing in the barracks. Since last year, the number of troops stationed in Wusong has gradually decreased, and most of the barracks are empty. Recently, there have been even fewer troops, except for a small number of the Tanaka Tomo Engineering Corps, which initially had five hundred men but now only has two hundred, and the military police. The other Japanese troops have all been transferred away. According to people in Wusong, these troops come and go frequently, but now, those who are transferred to Wusong for rest from the front line stay for at most a week before being transferred elsewhere. Therefore, there are often days when Songzhen is completely empty. Judging from the busy movement of troops, it is evident that they truly have no soldiers to spare in their country, and the Japanese troops in China have to increase aid in the east and west and are exhausted. With the garrison in Wusong being so empty, the few engineering corps and military police stationed there are constantly in a state of fear and anxiety. After the puppet squad leader Cao Jinhua was kidnapped by the Wusong guerrilla force on the night of the 28th of last month, the Japanese army became very fearful. In addition to special martial law, the Shanghai-Wusong train only runs to Gaojingmiao and no further north, causing suspicion and anxiety among the residents of Wusong.</p>
<h3>Frequent Artillery Battles Outside Wenzhou Port, Situation Remains Tense, Merchants from Other Provinces Exchange Both Local Goods and Payment</h3>
<p>The positions at Shitou outside Wenzhou Port were bombarded by Japanese warships on the 29th and 30th of last month. On the 31st, the Yueqing defense area was also bombarded. The garrison returned fire, resulting in fierce battles. Although Japanese warships left the waters of Wenzhou starting from the 1st of this month, the local situation remains tense, and the garrison is particularly vigilant. The Wenzhou County Government, considering the constant harassment by Japanese aircraft and warships, has, after deliberation, thoroughly evacuated the population and goods. The measures include: 1. Regarding the population, all elderly and weak individuals, except for able-bodied men, will be evacuated. 2. All schools in Wenzhou will be temporarily relocated to rural areas. 3. Regarding goods, most merchants have already evacuated to rural areas. If merchants from other provinces come to Wenzhou to purchase goods, both local goods and payment will be exchanged.</p>

<h3>French Ambassador Departs Shanghai Yesterday, Sailing to Haiphong on French Cruiser and Transferring to Chongqing, Will Visit Chinese Authorities for Courtesy Call</h3>
<p>Following several meetings between the British, American, and French ambassadors in Shanghai, American Ambassador Johnson left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 31st of last month, en route to Washington. French Ambassador Cosme departed Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:40 AM aboard the French cruiser Lamotte-Picquet, heading directly to Haiphong and then Chongqing. Accompanying him were General Texe, commander of the French Far East Naval Forces, and the ambassador's secretary, Laureames. Those who came to the pier to see them off included French Consul General in Shanghai, Baugé, and senior embassy officials. The Bund pier in the French Concession was temporarily under special guard by the police. It is reported that all Shanghai office affairs will be handled by the secretary, Baiset Zhong, who arrived in Shanghai from Beijing on the 31st of last month. It is reported that after arriving in Haiphong, the French Ambassador will take the Yunnan-Vietnam railway to Kunming, and then fly from Kunming to Chongqing to handle embassy affairs and plans to make a normal courtesy call to the Chinese authorities.</p>
<h3>Three American Submarines Depart in Formation</h3>
<p>Three American submarines, numbers 36, 38, and 40, have been in Shanghai for two weeks, berthed between pontoons 30 and 31 in Yangshupu. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the three submarines raised anchor in succession and departed in formation. Their destination is unknown.</p>
<h3>"Lanchang" Labor Strike Seeking Resolution, Management Expresses Sympathy for Workers, Puppet Organization Actively Involved</h3>
<p>The strike at the British-owned Lanchang Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, has lasted nearly two weeks. The management, deeply sympathetic to the experiences of the workers in Pudong, has notified all workers to elect representatives to meet with the general company office on Sichuan Road at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 5th) and stated that they would sympathetically consider reasonable demands. However, according to yesterday's investigation, the "China Worker's Allied Association" in Pudong is actively involved in the strike. The workers have received various threats and have not dared to openly gather to elect representatives to negotiate with the company. Therefore, there has been no opportunity for face-to-face discussion between labor and management. However, it is said that a solution may be possible soon.</p>

<h3>Japanese Obstructing Foreign Vessels from Clearing Customs, Various Countries Seeking Response, "Wantong" Steamer Changes Destination, "Niuzhuang" Steamer Also Diverted to North China</h3>
<p>Previously, the Japanese Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs notified that starting June 1st, ships sailing in the nine Jianghai ports must obtain prior permission from the Japanese Navy and Army and be issued a permit. When clearing customs, the customs clearance application and the Japanese permit must be submitted to the extra Customs Commissioner for approval before customs can be cleared and the ship can sail. As a result, last Saturday, the "Wantong" steamer of the British Swire Company, which operates on the Haimen-Qidong route, was denied clearance because it did not have the above-mentioned procedures. Although the company reported this to the British Consulate General requesting negotiation, it was Saturday, and the consulate was closed for the afternoon. The "Wantong" steamer was scheduled to depart yesterday (the 4th) morning according to the regular schedule, but due to the denial of customs clearance, it had to temporarily suspend sailing pending a resolution. Yesterday was Monday, but there was still no news from the British Consulate. To maintain the schedule and avoid losses, the company changed the destination yesterday to Qinglong Port, Sanhe Port, and other names for customs clearance, which was then approved. The ship is scheduled to resume sailing at 6:00 AM this morning. Furthermore, the "Niuzhuang" steamer of the same company, originally scheduled to depart this afternoon for Xiamen, as well as Wanxu and Quanzhou, was also afraid of being refused clearance because Xiamen and Quanzhou are also on the prohibited list. Therefore, the route was changed to Qingdao and Tianjin, scheduled to depart on the 8th. According to shipping merchants, ships operating in Xingang (Jingjiang), Xinshengang (Tongzhou), Zhangjiagang, Nituogang, Dongjiegang, and other places are still often obstructed when loading and unloading goods, even with permits, making the future of the shipping industry very pessimistic. Beisha is slightly more lenient because the Japanese army occupies fewer ports. It is said that the Japanese army in Zhangjiagang suddenly withdrew voluntarily the day before yesterday, and the reason is unknown.</p>
<p>Negotiations by Various Countries</p>
<p>The incident caused by the unauthorized announcement by Japanese Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, Koichi Oyama, obstructing foreign vessels from clearing customs, has drawn great attention from the authorities of Britain, the United States, and France, who have decided to take joint action to maintain treaty rights and the administrative sovereignty of the customs. In addition to British Consul General in Shanghai, Philip, conferring with Customs Commissioner Robert in recent days to stop the illegal actions of the Japanese Customs Commissioner, the US Consulate in Shanghai has also sent personnel to the Customs to investigate the truth. The French Consulate will also take the same attitude towards this case. However, the German and Italian authorities are still watching and have not expressed any position. Whether they have tacit agreement for Japanese concessions will be judged by their future attitudes.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police Arrest Fifteen Chinese, Japanese Newspaper Claims They Are Anti-Japanese Elements, Including Team Leader Gao Taoyun</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Japanese-language "Continental News" stated yesterday (the 4th) that on May 15th, Japanese military police searched a terrorist base near Kangnaowan Road in Western Shanghai and captured fifteen Chinese members of the "Iron Blood Assassination Squad," an anti-Japanese organization, including team leader Gao Taoyun, 28, and deputy team leader Chen Guosheng, 27. Gao is directly related to the assassination of Geng Shubo, the detective squad leader of the Caojiadu branch of the puppet Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, on February 1st next to Kangnaot Road. During the search, five pistols and two hand grenades were seized. Gao was formerly a detective of the Nanshi Police Bureau. After the fall of Shanghai, he fled to Pudong. When Japanese troops appeared in Pudong, Gao pretended to be the chairman of the Yunjiabao (transliteration) Maintenance Association. He obtained contact with Xu Kangdong (transliteration), the guerrilla leader in the area. In addition to providing the Chinese irregular army with information on the movements of the Japanese army, he also used his position to raise funds for the guerrillas under the guise of taxation. When the Japanese authorities became suspicious, Gao secretly left Pudong one night and entered the French Concession. In December of last year, he was ordered by a certain guerrilla leader in Zhenru to serve as the team leader of the Iron Blood Assassination Squad. Chen was previously a rice merchant in Pudong. In September of last year, he joined the guerrilla force and operated in the Yangjia Town and Linjiafang (both transliterations) areas. In January, he was introduced by Gao to join the terrorist group, responsible for fundraising and intelligence work in the Caojiadu area.</p>
<h3>President Coolidge Arrives in Shanghai Today, Passengers Can Arrive at the New Customs Wharf at 5:00 PM</h3>
<p>The President Coolidge of the American President Lines arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the 28th of last month, passing through Hong Kong to Little Luzon. It has now departed from Little Luzon and is returning to the United States. The company received a telegram from the ship yesterday stating that it is expected to arrive at 3:30 PM today. The company has scheduled docking at pontoons 12 and 13. The tender to pick up passengers will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 3:30 PM this afternoon and is expected to return to the New Customs Wharf at approximately 5:00 PM. The large ship is scheduled to raise anchor and return to the United States at 11:00 AM tomorrow (the 7th). The tender to see off passengers will depart at 9:30 AM tomorrow morning. It is reported that there are many passengers on this ship traveling from Luzon to the United States via Shanghai. There are 149 passengers arriving in Shanghai and 525 passengers traveling from Shanghai to the United States, totaling 674 passengers.</p>

<h3>Speculators Order Saigon Rice, Rice Industry Pays Close Attention, Order Quantity About 30,000 Bags, Most Agree to Cancel After Persuasion</h3>
<p>Previously, due to soaring rice prices in Shanghai, affecting the livelihood of ordinary people, various rice industry associations in the city suggested that the concession authorities order foreign rice to alleviate the situation. The authorities refused, citing sufficient rice reserves in Shanghai. However, the associations' suggestion was intended as a promotional measure to stabilize prices. Unexpectedly, some grain merchants specializing in speculation secretly ordered 2,000 tons of Saigon rice from overseas. According to investigations, the actual amount reached 2,800 tons, approximately 30,000 bags. It is said that a second batch is also being negotiated. Various rice industry associations, upon learning of this news, paid close attention. To conserve national resources and balance foreign exchange, they have vigorously advised all members not to purchase excessive foreign rice for support. As a result of this advice, some merchants who were negotiating to order a second batch of foreign rice have agreed to cancel the order. According to reports from related parties, since the outbreak of the war, the value of foreign rice imports through the Tianjin and Guangzhou customs has reached as high as 40 to 50 million yuan, which, including foreign wheat flour, accounts for the second largest share of imported goods.</p>
<p>Shanghai Rice Reserves Increase by Over 10,000 Bags</p>
<p>The Soybean and Rice Industry Association announced the total number of rice reserves for the tenth time, totaling 578,959 bags, an increase of 16,769 bags compared to the previous survey report. The reserves of each warehouse are listed as follows: Bank of China 100,213 bags, Bank of Communications 5,763 bags, Zhejiang Industrial and Xizha 91,921 bags, Shanghai First Warehouse 10,133 bags, Shanghai Second Xiechangde 2,536 bags, Industrial Bank 48,452 bags, Reclamation Bank 240 bags, China First Trust 313 bags, Local Bank 10,783 bags, Jin City 5,360 bags, Zehua 22,132 bags, Jiangsu Second Warehouse 2,729 bags, Donglai 3,876 bags, Zikang 9,445 bags, Hengfeng 1,235 bags, Longmao 23,418 bags, Yuanxing 124 bags, Yuanxiang 1,231 bags, Shengji 901 bags, Yongsheng 600 bags, Taikang 450 bags, Zhenfeng (North and South warehouses) 6,500 bags, Dafengchang 383 bags, Zhengda 3,316 bags, Dayouyu 5,771 bags, Dade Xinbei 1,245 bags, Yongxing 484 bags, Xinchangda 670 bags, Gongji 1,213 bags, Hengyigong 4,008 bags, Xinyu 4,430 bags, Dade Xinzhong 6,140 bags, Chengyi 390 bags, Xianmao 410 bags, Hengda 5,872 bags, Dade Xinnan 5,145 bags, Jutaihe 105 bags, Hengxingyi 229 bags, Jiangnan 5,229 bags, Yixingfeng 4,455 bags, Jiuda 1,094 bags, Wanchang 1,803 bags, Qinyi 2,012 bags, Heji 550 bags, Yucheng 809 bags, Hengtai 494 bags, Qiada 850 bags, Zhang Xieji 850 bags, Wanshengsheng 515 bags, Yusheng 525 bags, Wanshengtai 431 bags, Yixin 2,180 bags, Zhiji 320 bags, Zaitong 859 bags, Maotai 35,572 bags, Xichangde 1,702 bags, Qingshengyi 885 bags, Tongshen 4,004 bags, Roosevelt 2,200 bags, Taigu 55,007 bags, Changyiheng 1,011 bags, Dingtaide 13,972 bags, An Shen (two warehouses) 10,842 bags, Xinfeng 628 bags, Hufeng Xinyuan 12,881 bags, Renhe 420 bags, Xieda 561 bags, Zaixing 4,900 bags, Yuanmao 270 bags, Dingyu 10,562 bags, Yuantong 2,658 bags, Dingxing 5,050 bags, Dinghe 25,897 bags, Heji 13,192 bags, Huang Changsheng 1,965 bags, Tongfa 223 bags, Deng Rentai 1,778 bags, Fengsheng 1,231 bags, Hengxinshun 250 bags, Tongshenghang 329 bags, Wankang 100 bags, Hengxingan 562 bags, Wantai Xiang 915 bags, Pinghe 393 bags, Xieji 420 bags.</p>
<p>Smooth Supply and Stable Market</p>
<p>About 40,000 to 50,000 bags of Ke Xian rice were shipped from Wuhu to Shanghai last week. Vendors and merchants, noting the abundant inventory there, traveled long distances to procure it, resulting in demand exceeding supply and driving up prices in the production area. Consequently, fewer goods arrived in the past two days. In addition, about 7,000 to 8,000 bags were transported from Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, Changshu, Kunshan, and from the South, including Tongli, Beixie, Zhangyan, Songjiang, Fengjing, Jiashan, and Jiaxu, resulting in a buoyant supply. In recent days, the market has seen an increase in spot goods, and the rice reserves in all rice stores are sufficient. Transactions have resulted in supply exceeding demand, and prices have gradually declined. Except for the highest grade white japonica rice, which is still selling at 10.12 yuan, other grades of rice have generally returned to prices close to the 15 yuan limit. With the weather becoming warmer, rice prices are expected to fall further.</p>
<h3>French Embassy Counselor Discusses the Life of a Diplomat, Like the Wandering Life of Gypsies, Farewell Banquet Held for Noble's Return Home</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that French Embassy Counselor Noble is about to leave Shanghai. His friends held a farewell banquet at the French Handball Association on Saturday. Noble, in his reply, first expressed his gratitude to those who attended to send him off, then compared the life of a diplomat to the wandering life of Gypsies. He said that he came to Shanghai in 1937 at the beginning of the war and has to say goodbye after a short time, but he will always have pleasant memories of the city and expresses optimism about the future of Shanghai. It is said that Noble will soon return to France with his family.</p>
<h3>After Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Ningbo, Attempt to Cover Up Atrocities, Claiming Military Installations, But Bombing Sites Are All Commercial Areas</h3>
<p>After the urban area of Ningbo was bombed eight times by Japanese planes, it was unexpectedly attacked for the ninth time at 9:30 AM on the 3rd. The bombed sites were all commercial areas. The Japanese Fleet Press Department issued a statement on the afternoon of the 4th, claiming that "on the 3rd, powerful units of the Naval Air Force carried out reconnaissance attacks near Ningbo, bombing military facilities and military supply warehouses on the riverbank." According to related organizations, all of the sites hit in the nine bombings of Ningbo were shops and residences, and all the dead and wounded were innocent civilians. Ningbo has always been an undefended city with no so-called military facilities. The Japanese are using the attack on military facilities as an excuse, clearly attempting to cover up their atrocities of indiscriminate devastation.</p>
<h3>Over a Hundred Japanese Soldiers Landed on Changtu Island, Returned to Their Ships at Night, Seemingly Not Intending to Occupy for Long, Japanese Warships Move Erraticly in the Waters of Zhenhai and Qushan</h3>
<p>Changtu Island, which belongs to Dinghai County in Eastern Zhejiang, was previously occupied by Japanese soldiers who landed on January 11th of last year and began to withdraw in March. On the morning of the 27th of last month, two medium-sized Japanese warships sailed from Daishan and anchored off Niangjigong and Woweitou in Changtu Port. Subsequently, many soldiers poured ashore. Later, more than forty Japanese soldiers landed at the Zhengyi Temple on Shengdou Mountain in Niangjigong and searched the villages and towns in the upper and lower streets. They returned to their ships at night. One day, a Japanese warship arrived in the waters of Lindashan near Chuanshan in Zhenhai and sailed elsewhere the day before yesterday. Although Japanese warships have been patrolling in the waters of Qushan, they have not landed and the entire mountain is peaceful.</p>
<h3>Over Ten Thousand Jewish Refugees, Over 400 Arrived on an Italian Ship and Have Been Placed Separately</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that 465 German and Austrian Jewish refugees arrived here yesterday (the 4th) afternoon on the Italian mail ship Conte Verde, increasing the number of Jewish refugees residing in the city. Staff from the local committee caring for Jewish refugees were at the Kung Wo Wharf to assist those who disembarked, then sent them to various shelters. Most were placed in the shelter on Jingzhou Road, while others were sent to shelters on Huade Road, Zhaofeng Road, Huishan Road and the Riverine Apartments. It is estimated that the total number of Jewish refugees currently in Shanghai has reached 10,500. It is expected that another 9,000 will arrive in Shanghai this year.</p>

<h3>Order from the Central Executive Committee: Prohibition of Factional Cliques, Concentration of Efforts to Jointly Relieve National Crisis, Intensified Supervision and Constant Restraint</h3>
<p>The National Government's Central Executive Committee, in order to ensure coordinated action and eliminate factional cliques to concentrate efforts, has previously issued an order through the President to all levels to strictly comply and work together to overcome difficulties. However, reports indicate that some regions still have small cliques engaging in individual activities, which is highly inappropriate. Therefore, the Executive Committee reiterates its order, urging all to consider the current hardships, concentrate efforts, be of one mind and one heart, and jointly relieve the national crisis. Those who persist in their prejudices and outwardly comply but inwardly defy will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. Those responsible for supervision should especially exercise constant restraint. If such incidents are discovered again, they should be reported immediately without any favoritism. The aim is to eliminate all divisions and fulfill the President's earnest instructions.</p>
<h3>Commodity Exhibition: Closed Yesterday, Compilation of National Product Survey Statistics for Distribution to Southeast Asia to Promote Export Sales</h3>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association held a commodity exhibition at the Shanghai New World on Jing'an Temple Road, showcasing over ten thousand kinds of domestic goods. The exhibition was open to the public, providing citizens with an opportunity to identify domestic products and received high praise from all sectors. With the three-week exhibition period now over, it was officially closed yesterday. The association has sent a special letter to all participating manufacturers, instructing them to reclaim their exhibited goods within one week upon presentation of receipts. The manufacturers who have been approved by the review committee for awards will be notified separately for the distribution of certificates. The association previously received requests from various chambers of commerce in Southeast Asia, seeking information on the production of Shanghai domestic goods. In addition to dispatching personnel to conduct on-site investigations at member manufacturers, the association also took advantage of this exhibition to compile detailed survey statistics on Shanghai domestic goods, including factory names, product names, production volume, producers, trademarks, and other items, which will be sent to Southeast Asia for reference, thereby promoting the export of domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Ningbo-Fenghua Highway: Completely Cut Off, Ningbo Court Prisoners Safely Relocated</h3>
<p>After the Yushan to Xikou section of the Jiangkou East section of the Ningbo-Fenghua New Highway was destroyed last month under the provincial order, it is now known that the authorities, in order to consolidate the rear defense and stabilize public morale, have also thoroughly destroyed the Jiangkou-Fengcheng section of the highway by commencing excavation work. All bridges have been separately blown up. The destruction of the said highway section has now been completed.</p>
<p>Prisoners Safely Relocated</p>
<p>The Ningbo County District Court Detention Center, which detains various prisoners, has received a joint petition from the prisoners through the warden requesting safe relocation due to the continuous bombing of the city. Considering that the detainees have not yet been convicted and bear no certain guilt, the court president has ordered the release of those with minor offenses on bail to avoid unnecessary sacrifice. The remaining prisoners have been transferred to another location for temporary detention.</p>
<p>Cold Storage Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>Ningbo was subjected to the ninth bombing by Japanese aircraft on the morning of the 3rd, with bombs landing on Dadaotou, Dongdu Road, Fangjing Road, Tangjie, and the Lingqiao vegetable market. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the Wangjiang Street Cold Storage Company, which had been bombed once before, was bombed again. This cold storage was a leading enterprise in the first district of Ningbo, and its destruction is deeply regrettable.</p>
<h3>Copper Coin Shortage in the Market, Japanese Collecting Scrap Iron, Over 10,000 Tons Accumulated, Soon to be Shipped to Japan, Thuggish Lackeys Still Searching Everywhere</h3>
<p>Although the financial situation in the city has remained stable due to the National Government's sufficient preparation despite the prolonged war, a shortage of copper coins has suddenly emerged in the market. This phenomenon appeared a week ago, and now exchange locations are also affected, making it difficult to operate and hindering circulation. Even transportation vehicles, which usually have an abundance of copper coins, are experiencing panic. This indicates that someone is manipulating the supply of copper coins in the city, or even secretly hoarding them, leading to a sudden and sharp reduction. It is hoped that the city's silver and money industries will pay close attention to this and act with utmost integrity to maintain the people's livelihood. At the same time, it has been learned that the Japanese puppets have been collecting scrap copper and iron in the Jiangnan war zone in recent months and hoarding it in Shanghai. There are warehouses near a puppet-run fish market on Qiwupu Road, with a total of over 10,000 tons accumulated, ready to be shipped to Japan in batches. Furthermore, purchasing points are secretly scattered everywhere, and thuggish lackeys are enticing ignorant residents with high prices to sell their old iron tools, leading to an increasing scarcity of old copper and scrap iron.</p>
<h3>Municipal Women and Children's Education Center Opens Yesterday, Emphasis on Education and Vocational Training for Women and Children in the Center</h3>

<h3>Dedicated to Men and Women Grieving Lost Love or Marital Discord</h3>
<p>Love: Some say it is a mystery, some say it is strength, and even some hypocritical scholars say it is a sin. What is it really? I believe that everyone, both men and women, understands it very well in their hearts. According to Spencer's analysis, a person's life mainly consists of economic life and sexual life, with social and moral life being secondary. The saying "Only when one is well-fed and warmly clothed does one think of lustful desires" and "Knowing honor and shame only comes after the granary is full" are both based on factual assertions. To put it bluntly, love arises from the need for sexual life. Sexuality is an innate instinct, present from birth, and fully expressed in adulthood. Physiological research shows that there is a specific organ in our body responsible for reproduction, namely the gonads. This organ is responsible for the development of the body's appearance and weight in childhood and specializes in reproductive work after adulthood. Therefore, if this gland is healthy, the body will naturally be strong, and the intelligence will naturally be agile. The head will be clear, and the energy will be abundant. This is not only welcomed by women, but also allows one to be successful in love, and to choose the most satisfactory partner. Even after marriage, the love between husband and wife will be deep, and raising children will lead to a happy family. If young people do not cherish themselves, and engage in self-gratification, nocturnal emissions, or early marriage and excessive indulgence, or frequent flower shops and unrestrained debauchery, the reproductive function will be damaged. It may also be due to hereditary factors, or post-illness disorders, that the reproductive function is weakened. In that case, symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin semen, infertility, and neurasthenia are inevitable. Indeed, a man like this is often abandoned by the opposite sex because of his unattractive appearance. The pain of lost love is self-inflicted. Why should he blame the other party? Even after marriage, marital life will not be happy, leading to henpecked husbands or marital discord, and family tragedies. This is also mostly the man's own fault. Therefore, a smart man must reflect on himself, and if it is due to physical weakness, he should quickly seek effective remedies, which will undoubtedly remove the disadvantages and bring good fortune.</p>
<p>What is an effective remedy? It is necessary to use gonadal endocrine therapy, that is, to quickly take the gonadal preparation "Germinal Essence", which is the most effective treatment. This agent is extracted from the gonads of strong animals such as chimpanzees, deer, and sea dogs, and replicated using scientific methods. The precious nourishing substances are completely preserved and abundant. According to Dr. Millmiling, a famous German physician, who compared this agent with other similar preparations, it not only proves that its quality is always five to ten times higher than other similar preparations, but the number of cured cases is also about thirty times higher. Because this agent can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, nourish the nerves, and promote developmental function within one day and night after taking it, and can invigorate metabolism. If you continue to take it, it will fundamentally cure the above symptoms in the short term, and make the body healthier and extend life. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemetol Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" (available in Sino-British, Sino-French, Hua-English and other pharmacies) to consolidate the sperm and stop the leakage, so that both the root and the branch can be treated, and the effect will be faster.</p>
<h3>The Failure and Success of Spermatorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, VD Specialist</p>
<p>Many young people have ruined their future because of the failure of spermatorrhea treatment. This is indeed due to the patient's lack of determination or common sense, but the medical profession should also bear considerable responsibility. The reason why young people have spermatorrhea is mostly because of committing self-gratification and indulgence, which damages the sexual nerves. When the sexual nerves are weakened or become hypersensitive, the spermatic duct often loses its control, and spermatorrhea arises from this. Knowing this, to treat spermatorrhea, we must start by consolidating the spermatic duct and nourishing and calming the nerves. "Hemetol Sperm-Consolidating Tablets," secretly made by Dr. Hemetol of Germany, fully possess this function. Therefore, all those who can use this medicine will undoubtedly receive the effect of medicine arriving and the disease being removed. If you take other miscellaneous brands such as spermatorrhea tablets, because the function is weak, it often leads to failure in treatment. If spermatorrhea treatment fails or is delayed, the so-called "a small leak will sink a great ship." The symptoms will inevitably worsen, or even lead to exhaustion of sperm and blood, and all kinds of diseases will arise. Symptoms such as weakness, forgetfulness and insomnia, back pain, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and infertility will occur one after another. This kind of young people not only cannot study and work, and their future is bleak, but also cannot have a happy marital life, and the family will often fall into tragedy, or have no children, premature aging, and early death! Therefore, early and thorough cure of spermatorrhea is a very urgent need for patients. Dr. Lin of Germany once praised "Hemetol Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" as the only savior for young people with spermatorrhea. If spermatorrhea has already caused the above symptoms, you must also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Essence" to nourish the brain and kidneys, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, you will be able to restore perfect health soon. If patients come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by expert doctors, and then use electrotherapy and injections, we can guarantee a cure.</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>The Threat and Rescue of Breast Atrophy</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA</p>
<p>Facing the mirror under the gauze window, applying rouge and powder, and putting on makeup, suddenly seeing shriveled breasts while changing clothes, breaking one's heart and sighing alone! No matter what mistake or defect, if no one points it out, or if you have not thought of it yourself, you don't feel anything. Once someone points it out, and you think about it carefully, you feel uglier and more uneasy. For example, a woman with shriveled breasts, when she gets up in the morning and faces the mirror, applying rouge and powder, she never thought she was not beautiful. She looks left and right, and is very proud. But when she takes her clothes to change, and sees the ugly state of her shriveled breasts, she will suddenly cool down from the previous proud look on her face. She even breaks her heart, sighs, and hates for no reason!</p>
<p>However, what is said here is just her own sigh. If someone else gives her a sarcastic remark, her inner pain will be even worse! Therefore, there cannot be defects on a person's body. If there are defects, they should be actively remedied. For example, for women with shriveled breasts, thin buttocks, and loss of beauty, the main reason is the weakness of ovarian function, which affects metabolism. The most effective and reliable method is to take the gonadal ovarian endocrine preparation "Germinal Essence" for women. This agent has high-quality ingredients and is carefully prepared. It has been proven by famous doctors in various countries around the world, and is considered to have peaceful medicinal properties and great effects. After taking it for one day and night, it can nourish ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea. If you continue to take it, it can not only make the shriveled breasts gradually become erect, but also make the thin buttocks gradually become plump, enhance the love between husband and wife, promote pregnancy function, strengthen the body and maintain beauty. It is truly the only holy medicine for modern women.</p>

<h3>What is the Secret to Curing Gonorrhea?</h3>
<p>Recently, the promotion of gonorrhea treatment by general physicians in the market seems to be only one kind, and this kind of promotion focuses on the treatment aspect. But to fundamentally solve gonorrhea, the following three conditions must be met:</p>
<p>(1) The doctor's own knowledge and experience!</p>
<p>(2) The equipment should be meticulous and should be developed with the times!</p>
<p>(3) The patient should trust reputable and responsible experts!</p>
<p>If the above three conditions can be met, there is no need to worry about solving any gonorrhea. First of all, if the doctor has rich medical knowledge and rich clinical experience, and has a brand-new mind, he will not be confined by many years of clinical experience. Otherwise, the more experience he has, the older his mind will be, and he will refuse to absorb new knowledge and become a laggard of the times. This kind of doctor is not worth much. The second condition is the equipment aspect. Now that science is advancing rapidly, the equipment for gonorrhea treatment should be the most advanced medical equipment. In this regard, I often inspect the new equipment in major hospitals in Europe and the United States, and purchase the latest medical equipment every year. For example, microscopes, cystoscopes and other medical equipment must be replaced every year to promote the effectiveness of diagnosis. The third condition is that patients should trust and not change their minds about doctors who are responsible and reputable. If you can follow the above, gonorrhea can be absolutely cured. This is the secret to curing gonorrhea. For those suffering from acute and chronic gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, orchitis, arthritis, etc., in addition to using the latest medical equipment for detailed examination and diagnosis, you must also have German Filt淋平流电疗法 (German Filt Lymph Smooth Flow Electrotherapy), German Xi's Serum, cold electrotherapy, various types of 菩齐 (Pu Qi), homemade vaccines, etc., which can be used according to the symptoms. In as little as two weeks and as much as five weeks, you can cure ten out of ten.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Fake Cigarettes, Tout Arrested Four Times, Investigation of Counterfeiting Accomplices</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, there have been many abnormally developed businesses, and cigarettes are one of them. General emerging large-scale cigarette companies take advantage of this opportunity to easily evade taxes and the urgent need in the occupied areas to produce crude and substandard products, and even arbitrarily imitate the brand names and trademarks of famous cigarettes, caring only for profit and disregarding reputation. Therefore, recently</p>
<p>counterfeiting and selling</p>
<p>cases of counterfeit cigarettes have been cracked more frequently. Now there is another tout, Fan Shaobo from Ningbo, who specializes in selling counterfeit cigarettes, who has been arrested by Chinese detective Zhao Zigan of the Hongkou Police Station. The suspect has been engaged in this business and has been arrested and punished by the court, but he still did not repent. Last month, he sold five large boxes of counterfeit cigarettes imitating a certain foreign company's product to Dongbao Foreign Firm, opened by a Korean, at 360 Tiantong Road for</p>
<p>法币 (legal tender) 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Later, the firm transported them to the occupied area and sold them to the Japanese army, who then realized they were of poor quality. The owner of Dongbao reported to the police station and requested an investigation. A few days ago, Fan came to the firm again to tout counterfeit goods, and the owner managed to stall him while secretly reporting to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Detective Zhao and Western detectives to rush there.</p>
<p>arrested on the spot</p>
<p>The next morning, he was sent to the First Special District District Court for trial. According to Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the police station, the counterfeit cigarettes sold by the suspect need to be identified by the original company that produced them, and the counterfeiting accomplices need to be investigated. Therefore, he requested an extension. Judge Zhong interrogated Fan Shaobo and ordered him to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Accused Admits to Strangling Paramour, Sentencing Next Monday</h3>
<p>Li Jingen, a carpenter from Suzhou who worked at the Zhonghua Woodware Shop at 847 Qiwupu Road, Aoshuipu, had a relationship with Gu Xiaomei, a woman from Changzhou in her teens, before the Battle of Shanghai. Due to the outbreak of the war and the fact that their residence was in the war zone, they each went their own way and separated. In April of this year, Li and Gu suddenly met again on Qiwupu Road,</p>
<p>reunited after a long separation</p>
<p>and became especially intimate. They both agreed to rekindle their old relationship and cohabitate again. They rented a room in the kitchen in Lane 130, No. 23 Jining Road. Unexpectedly, during their cohabitation, Li suddenly discovered that Gu Xiaomei had another lover and was once caught by Li. Consumed by jealousy, the desire to kill arose in his mind. In the middle of the night on the 20th of last month, Li, taking advantage of Gu Xiaomei's deep sleep, suddenly put a rope around Gu's neck and tightened it forcefully,</p>
<p>instantly strangling her to death.</p>
<p>After the incident, he dug a hole in the floor of the bedroom and buried the body, intending to cover up the crime. This was discovered by Peng Zhenxuan, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, who arrested Li and exhumed the body. The Special Court examined the body and sent it to the Pushan Villa for burial, and sent Li to the First Special Court to be prosecuted for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. A confession has already been taken,</p>
<p>and the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin presided over the second hearing in the Second Criminal Court. According to the landlady, Mrs. Li Jin, who came to report, she rented the kitchen to the defendant and the deceased for only forty days at a monthly rent of three yuan. However, she was completely unaware of the defendant's act of strangling Gu Xiaomei and burying the body, and had never heard them</p>
<p>arguing</p>
<p>on weekdays. Subsequently, witnesses Wang Songda, the owner of the Zhonghua Woodware Shop, and A-Quan and Hai-Quan, etc., testified. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he killed Gu by strangling her with a rope because of her infidelity. After mutual arguments between Jiang Baolian, a lawyer from the police station, and Xuan Zhendong, an assigned lawyer, the court ended the debate and ordered the defendant to be detained pending sentencing next Monday.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Driver Released, Gang Carries Out Robbery</h3>
<p>Wang Gongshi, a woman from Suzhou in her forties who lives at No. 1, Lane 170, Father Laro Road in the French Concession, whose husband runs a dye business, was robbed on the morning of the fourth day (yesterday) at 6:00 AM when the maid got up to empty the chamber pot. Three robbers suddenly barged into the inner room with handguns, frightening them into silence. They ransacked the place and stole a diamond ring, gold bracelet, and cash totaling more than six hundred yuan. When the thieves fled, the victim's family followed them and arrested the robber, Lu Hailin (33 years old) from Nantong, and brought him to the police station. According to him, he was instigated by He Jingkui, who pulled a rickshaw in the victim's house, and formed a gang to rob. The detectives arrested He and sent them to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court that afternoon. Judge Liao interrogated them. Yuan Jiagou, a lawyer from the French Concession Administration, explained the case and requested a postponement to apprehend the remaining accomplices, investigate and prosecute after the investigation. Then Wang Longshi, the victim, recounted the robbery. After questioning the defendants in court, they were ordered to be detained for further questioning on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Sends Condolences to the Family of Cao Bingsheng</h3>

At that time, Fang Yong'an, a Chinese detective chief from the Old Gate Police Station, and Western officer No. 156, Chinese officers No. 61 and No. 1579 were patrolling and chased after them separately. They immediately arrested Tang Wenbin, a robber from Pudong, on the spot, but the stolen goods had been taken away by the other five robbers, so nothing was recovered. Subsequently, a leather bag and a bayonet were found at the plaintiff's residence, which were brought back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process and requested permission for postponement for a week for further questioning, because it was still necessary to apprehend the accomplices and investigate the stolen goods. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered the defendant to be returned to prison for further questioning in a week.</p>

<h3>Exhibition of Wu Changshuo's Posthumous Works; Today is the Last Day</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Changshuo was a master of calligraphy, painting, and seal carving. After his death in 1927, the art world decided to hold an exhibition of his posthumous works to commemorate him. This time, the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is tracing Wu's contributions and studying his life and art. They have collected nearly 200 pieces of Wu's outstanding calligraphy and paintings from the age of 43 to 80. The exhibition opened on the first of this month in the painting hall of the Great World Department Store. The exhibition hall is arranged into three rooms in a V shape, reflecting Wu's bold and unrestrained style, like a celestial horse soaring through the sky. The works are arranged in chronological order, allowing viewers to study the evolution of his techniques. In the center of the hall is a portrait of Wu at the age of 78 and a self-portrait. The portraits are adorned with flower baskets presented by Liu Haisu, the president of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, and celebrities from all walks of life, creating a solemn and academic atmosphere. Today is the last day. All proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to medical relief efforts.</p>
<h3>French Police Department Urges Citizens to Respect Traffic Regulations; Following the Public Concession's Safety Campaign; More Officers Added at Busy Intersections to Correct Pedestrians</h3>
<p>Following the launch of a safety campaign by the Public Concession to reduce traffic accidents and protect citizen safety, the French Concession Police Department has also launched a similar campaign. In addition to distributing large numbers of leaflets and slogans, they have also added officers at busy intersections to dissuade pedestrians from jaywalking. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Admonishment to Respect Traffic Regulations</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department has issued a concise public notice to reduce traffic accidents. The original text states that the population of the French Concession has increased significantly in recent years, and the number of cars, rickshaws, small carts, and pedestrians on the roads has also increased, unfortunately leading to a continuous increase in traffic accidents. In 1938, 48 people died and 1,555 were injured in traffic accidents. The number of accidents must be reduced. The only way to do this is for pedestrians, rickshaw pullers, small cart drivers, car passengers, and car drivers to firmly respect traffic regulations and obey the orders of traffic police. It is better to drive or walk more slowly than to be the cause or victim of an accident.</p>
<p>Distributing Large Numbers of Slogans and Leaflets</p>
<p>In order to expand the safety campaign's publicity, the Police Department has printed a large number of slogans and leaflets, which are being distributed by police officers to promote public awareness and reduce accidents. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Walk on the sidewalks. (2) Cross the street near intersections, and only when traffic is blocked by traffic police. (3) Before crossing the street, look left and right for oncoming vehicles. (4) When crossing the street with children, hold their hands firmly. (5) Do not run when crossing the street. (6) Wait for streetcars on the sidewalk, and only step forward when the streetcar has stopped. (Remember) (1) Pedestrians are often victims of traffic accidents. (2) Careless pedestrians are the cause of traffic accidents, or cause harm to others.</p>
<p>Adding Officers to Correct Pedestrians</p>
<p>A Chinese officer of the Police Department stated that citizens often like to walk in the middle of the road instead of on the sidewalks, leading to congestion and increasing the risk of accidents. In view of this, the French Police Department posted white cloth banners along Avenue Joffre and Avenue Dubail in February of this year, boldly stating "Please walk on the sidewalk, do not walk in the middle of the road." However, most citizens still do not comply. In order to effectively implement this, the Police Department has added more officers to Avenue Joffre and intersections to correct pedestrians. In addition to stopping them from crossing the street when the light is red, they are also advising them to walk on the sidewalks. Those who stubbornly refuse will be forced to comply.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Sanitarium's Public Health Facilities; Promoting Preventive Medicine; Popularizing Early Diagnosis</h3>
<p>The Hongqiao Sanitarium at No. 990 Avenue Joffre has recently established a Public Health Department specifically to promote preventive medicine and popularize early diagnosis. The designated departments and attending physicians are as follows: (1) Guidance on the prevention of acute infectious diseases, early diagnosis of kidney disease, liver disease, premature aging, and stroke: Li Guangxun. (2) Full body health check-ups, early diagnosis of high blood pressure and heart disease: Ding Huikang. (3) Tuberculosis prevention and X-ray examination: Liu Deqi and Shen Zhiming. (4) Prenatal health guidance and reproductive examinations: Lin Youliang. (5) Throat and tuberculosis department: Yang Songxian. (6) Pediatric pulmonary disease department: Chu Linsun. (7) Skeletal health check-ups: Ren Tinggui. (8) Trauma check-ups: Yang Yuwen. (9) Guidance on the prevention of venereal diseases: Yu Zhuochu. (10) Pathology examinations: Tao Peiyuan and Liu Dexin. In addition, a trachoma treatment department has been established. Those who come for treatment will not be charged consultation or surgery fees until they are cured. School-age children who come to the hospital for treatment will receive all examinations free of charge. The consultation hours can be inquired by telephone in advance. With the hospital's excellent facilities and the enthusiastic guidance of specialized physicians, public health will definitely be greatly improved.</p>

<h3>Son Disobedient and Violent; Destroys Shoe Workshop; Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Wang Zaizhou, the evildoer, runs a shoe workshop at No. 4, Lane 309, Park Road. His wife, Yang, his 19-year-old son, Wang Wenzheng, and his daughter-in-law, Wu, all live and work in the workshop. It was originally a harmonious family living by their craft. Unexpectedly, his son Wenzheng's nature is beastly. He does not obey instructions and disregards money. Recently, he has become even more extreme. The other day, because his parents could not satisfy his desires, he became enraged and, wielding a stick, destroyed all the objects and tools in the workshop. His white-haired parents and young wife were powerless to stop his violent actions. Afterwards, an employee, Liu Fuhou, reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Detective Wang Shidong and a Western detective to the scene. They arrested the assailant and took him, along with the weapon, to the police station. Yesterday, he was brought before Judge Zhong of the First Special District Court. After the police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, presented the case, Wang Zaizhou recounted his rebellious son's violent behavior and begged for punishment. The defendant's wife, Wu, also testified that her husband had been violent towards his parents. The court, considering Wang Wenzheng's disobedient and violent actions, ordered him to be severely punished and sentenced him to six months' imprisonment as a warning.</p>

<h3>Modern Girl Dies From Poisoning This Morning; Still Made a Date to Meet Her Lover After Taking Poison; Sent to Hospital After Discovery but Treatment Was Ineffective</h3>
<p>Ai Lizhu, a girl from Huzhou, 20 years old, with a slender figure and fashionable clothes, lived at No. 339 Shanxi Road. Ai was fond of dancing and often frequented major dance halls in her spare time. She had a boyfriend, Zhang, who lived at a certain address on Avenue Ghisi. He was a college student, young and handsome, a fine young man. He and Ai had a close relationship and their affection was unwavering. At around 10:30 PM last night, Ai left a dance hall and went to a public telephone near Avenue Sainte Marie to call Zhang, asking him to come to meet her. Soon after, Zhang arrived and they whispered sweet nothings. However, Zhang vaguely smelled an unusual odor emanating from Ai's mouth. He questioned her, and she revealed the truth. She said that she had bought two bottles of a certain poisonous liquid and had already swallowed one bottle, leaving the other bottle in her room at home. As she spoke, tears rolled down her cheeks, and she expressed a desire to end her life. Zhang was shocked by this news and at a loss. He quickly called for a car and accompanied her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, the poison had already taken effect and treatment was ineffective. She tragically passed away at 0:30 AM this morning. The hospital reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to the scene and detained Zhang. They also notified the girl's family to come. The police are currently investigating why the girl took poison.</p>

Bad news from Chongqing: Pole vault champion Fu Baolu has died in action, sacrificing his life for the country in an aerial battle with Japanese planes in Guilin.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of this month, during the Sino-Western Games, Hualian athlete Zhang Jiakui reported that a friend had sent a letter from Fangyan to Shanghai, stating that Fu Baolu, the "Pole Vault King" of China, had died in action in an aerial battle in Guilin. After hearing the news, his father, Mr. Yaoting, was doubtful, as Mr. Fu had sent a letter to his family only two weeks prior, but he was already extremely saddened. Yesterday, a dispatch from the Haitong News Agency in Chongqing on the 5th stated, "According to news received here, Fu Baolu, a famous Chinese athlete who represented China in the pole vault at the 1936 Berlin World Games, recently died in action in an aerial battle with Japanese planes in Guilin, sacrificing his life heroically. Fu was from the three northeastern provinces and joined the air force after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, serving as a pilot." From this, it can be seen that news of Mr. Fu's death has come from various sources. It is known that after the three northeastern provinces were occupied, Mr. Fu came to Shanghai from Harbin in 1934, winning the pole vault championship at the National Games several times. He attended the Berlin World Games, winning second place and bringing glory to the country, for which everyone admired him. Later, he studied and repaired airplanes in Shanghai and learned to fly. After the outbreak of war, he first went to Hankou, then to Kunming, where his flying skills became excellent. He also served as an aviation instructor. Now, unfortunately, bad news has come frequently.</p>

<p>Yesterday's black market for spot gold initially fell below 2,100 yuan, due to weak buying interest from merchant groups and a sudden selling trend from Tianjin businesses. As a result, many speculative investors rushed to sell, and banks also competed to dump their holdings, causing a glut of chips in the market. The price fell to a low of 2,094 yuan at closing, a drop of seven yuan. Market sentiment was weak, and trading was slow, with only over 500 taels changing hands throughout the day. Gold jewelry prices in jewelry stores remained unchanged, and Customs Gold and Sino-British pure gold prices remained the same.</p>

<p>From the morning, sellers such as cash shops initially quoted 2,102 yuan per "tiao" (10 taels), but due to low buying interest from merchant groups, the price gradually lowered. At the 9:50 AM opening, the price was already one yuan lower than the previous weekend. A cash shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange business for 2,100 yuan, and jewelry businesses traded 50 taels among themselves at the same price. At that time, due to weak buying interest, individual investors and jewelry businesses competed to sell, causing the market to weaken further. The price suddenly dropped by three yuan. A spot gold shop, acting on behalf of individual investors, sold 50 taels to a money exchange business for 97 yuan. Jewelry businesses and the De Fu securities business successively sold a total of 100 taels to a money exchange business at the same price. Soon after, jewelry businesses sold another 100 taels to a gold shop (acting on behalf of a South China business) at 96 yuan each. Later, the money exchange business came back to buy, and the market price gradually increased. The money exchange business bought 20 taels from fellow businesses and 50 taels from jewelry businesses, both at 97 yuan each. Later, they bought another 50 taels from fellow businesses at 98 yuan, which became the midday closing price. In the afternoon, due to renewed selling interest from the De Fu securities business and hesitant buyers, the market trended downwards again. However, there were no transactions for a long time. It was not until after 3:30 PM that the De Fu securities business sold 50 taels to a money exchange business, with the price falling by four yuan compared to the midday closing price, to 94 yuan. There were no further transactions until the evening closing, so the closing price remained at 2,094 yuan, a drop of seven yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The price fluctuated by only six yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash shops' own brands was 2,100 yuan, and the buying price was 2,090 yuan. The current premium was 50 yuan lower than the advertised premium, and there was a market but no trading.</p>

<p>The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash remained at 1,211.6 yuan, the advertised price for Customs Gold also remained at 2.394 yuan, and the Shanghai Standard Gold price also remained fixed at 1,206.9 yuan, due to the London cable on the 3rd reporting that British pure gold remained at £7, 8 shillings, and 5 pence per ounce.</p>
<p>外滙交易　銀行對做居多</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Trading: Mostly Interbank Transactions</p>
<p>外滙暗盤市况、昨日仍形呆滯、中途洋行與紗花帮會來扒結、但因外行如東方等賣意甚濃、因之缺乏變化、結果現期價均呆而不動、交易以中外銀行互做居多、至港滙亦鮮活動、終則仍平、</p>
<p>The black market for foreign exchange remained sluggish yesterday. Foreign firms and cotton yarn businesses attempted to settle accounts, but due to strong selling interest from foreign banks such as Dongfang, there was little change. As a result, spot and forward prices remained stagnant. Transactions were mostly between Chinese and foreign banks. There was little activity in the Hong Kong exchange rate, which ultimately remained flat.</p>

<p>In the early morning, the London long-term rate narrowed by 0.0625 for near, medium, and long terms. New York silver prices remained fixed, and London raw gold remained flat. The exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai currency, and French francs were all flat. The US dollar rate against the British pound was up by 0.0625, against Shanghai currency by a small amount of 0.05, and against the French franc was still flat. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with a spot selling price of 8 pence and 25 for British pounds and 16.09375 yuan for US dollars, with no change from the previous closing. After the opening, foreign firms rushed to settle accounts for spot British pounds, which were successively supplied by foreign banks such as HSBC, Macquarie, and Dongfang. The price remained at 8 pence and 25. Subsequently, the Overseas Chinese Bank sold spot US dollars to fellow banks at 16.09375 yuan, so the situation was unchanged. When HSBC announced its listed prices, there was no movement, and the silver balancing tax was slightly higher, calculated at a small 0.5%, equivalent to 4.50%. At that time, the foreign bank Dongfang sold August British pounds to fellow banks at 8 pence and 171875. Following that, Chinese cotton yarn businesses purchased US dollars for the current month from a certain bank for 16.0625 yuan. The market remained stable. Near noon, there were only Hong Kong dollar transactions. The foreign bank Huayi sold spot dollars to a money exchange business at 55.25 yuan. The midday closing spot selling prices for British pounds and US dollars at banks were about the same as the morning opening. The Hong Kong exchange rate remained at 55.25 yuan.</p>
<p>後市洋行界繼續扒結麥加利現貨英余八辨士二五、繼而華行塞予外行現貨美滙十六元〇九三七五、後東方再售予安達七月份美滙爲十六元、是以過程仍乏變化、入後外行荷蘭稍有塞予錢兌業現貨港滙價仍爲五十五元二五、狀况亦平、延至晚收銀行現貨賣價、英匯八辨士二五、美滙十六元〇九三七五、港匯五十五元二五、結果比上週末午收、英美港日滙、悉無榮辱、</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to settle accounts with Macquarie for spot British pounds at 8 pence and 25. Subsequently, a Chinese bank sold spot US dollars to a foreign bank at 16.09375 yuan. Later, Dongfang resold July US dollars to Anda for 16 yuan. The process remained unchanged. Later, the foreign bank Holland slightly sold spot Hong Kong dollars to a money exchange business, with the price still at 55.25 yuan. The situation was also flat. Until the evening closing, the spot selling prices for British pounds, US dollars, and Hong Kong dollars at banks were: 8 pence and 25 for British pounds, 16.09375 yuan for US dollars, and 55.25 yuan for Hong Kong dollars. As a result, compared to the midday closing on the previous weekend, there were no gains or losses for British pounds, US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, or Japanese currency.</p>

<p>On the previous Saturday, British pure gold remained unchanged, and the British pound/US dollar exchange rate rose by 0.0625. Yesterday, in the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms settled accounts frequently, and foreign banks supplied smoothly, so the market price did not change. Spot gold shops and money exchange businesses supplied and sold, so the market was weak and fell by seven yuan. The demand for foreign currency British pounds and US dollars was very low, and spot gold was weak, so they all fell. The supply and demand for British pound and US dollar drafts were still strong. The demand for British pound drafts increased slightly and rose. The supply and demand for Hong Kong drafts were balanced, and the price did not change. The supply of French franc drafts was slightly higher, and the price fell back down. The demand for Annam piastres and Italian lira was high, and the price rose. Japanese gold drafts were traded at 9 jiao, 2 fen, and 7 li in the morning. The market supply was relatively smooth. Because the authorities manipulated it strictly, the decline was not severe. The result was 9 jiao, 2 fen, and 3 li. The supply and demand for Korean won was relatively low, and the market was stable. It was traded at 8 jiao, 3 fen, and 7 li in the morning, and the result was 8 jiao, 3 fen, and 5 li. There were no guild transactions. Yesterday, British pounds fell by 5 fen, British pound drafts rose by 1 fen, US dollars fell by 2 jiao, French franc drafts fell by 2.5 hao, Annam piastres and Italian lira each rose by 1 fen, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<p>工商談助白煤加價的索隱  培本</p>
<p>Discussion on the Reasons for the Increased Price of White Coal by Peiben</p>
<p>在往年：白煤生意，一到了夏令，不但銷塲淸淡，就是價目因供過於求，逐步回跌，經理的行家，在這落令時期，祇求不致虧本，也很願意脫貨求現，所謂「六個月大六個月小，賺錢蝕本，是商界的常事，今歲，亂世年頭，百物昂貴，就是燃料的煤炭，也不能例外，在此落令時開，不但不見回跌，鴻某由煤却從六月一日起塊煤每噸加起三元盤子，這種反乎情理的漲價，不但外行莫明其妙，就是同業也以爲事出非常，　愣萬分。</p>
<p>In previous years, when it came to white coal business, during the summer season, not only was the market sluggish, but the prices gradually fell due to oversupply. Dealers only sought to avoid losses during this off-season and were willing to sell their goods for cash. As the saying goes, "Six months up, six months down. Making money and losing money is common in the business world." This year, in these chaotic times, everything is expensive. Even fuel coal is no exception. During this off-season, instead of seeing a decline, Hongji Coal raised the price of lump coal by three yuan per ton starting June 1st. This unreasonable price increase not only baffled outsiders, but also made fellow dealers think that something extraordinary had happened and were extremely surprised.</p>
<p>雖然，經理行家漲價的理由，是「水脚飛漲，成本提高」，但是：爲什慶同船來貨的鴻基屑子却又不漲呢？何況水脚的飛漲在云歲早已提高，又為什麼直待銷塲落時的夏令方纔漲價呢？這兩個謎，却是一般同業引爲令人費解的問題，可是，無風不起浪；一個果的產生，必有原因！</p>
<p>Although the reason given by dealers for the price increase was "soaring freight costs and increased costs," why didn't the price of Hongji Coal dross, which came on the same ships, also increase? Moreover, freight costs had already increased significantly this year. Why did the price increase only occur during the summer season, when the market is slow? These two mysteries are considered perplexing questions by fellow dealers. However, there is no wave without wind. The production of a result must have a cause!</p>
<p>（一）產地限制出口　國產白煤，本有河南，山西等礦，軍興以來，因交通阻梗，來源斷絕，本市燃料，端賴洋煤支持，白煤有法屬鴻基，海峯，馬克等貨，每年我國進口，達二十餘萬噸，足堪供應，但自去歲起，該國爲儲藏燃料，以備軍用，對於塊煤出口，巳有限制，故邇來到貨不多，求過於供，「物稀爲貴」，以致行家一再抬高價格，實基於此。</p>
<p>(1) Export Restrictions in Production Areas: Domestic white coal originally came from mines in Henan and Shanxi provinces. Since the outbreak of the war, due to transportation disruptions, the supply has been cut off. The city's fuel relies on imported coal. White coal includes goods from French-owned Hongji, Haifeng, and Mac mines. China imports more than 200,000 tons annually, which is sufficient to supply the market. However, since last year, in order to store fuel for military use, the country has restricted the export of lump coal, so there are fewer goods arriving recently. Demand exceeds supply, so "scarce goods are valuable," leading dealers to repeatedly raise prices. This is the real reason.</p>
<p>（二）以得償失政策　塊煤出口雖然受了限制，可是，做煤球原料的鴻基屑子，却又大批裝到，各棧堆積存貨，達兩三萬噸，以致推動不易，不得不創價傾銷，而經理行家又須填款拆息及棧租種種負担，代人作嫁，所得無幾，乃不得不取償於塊煤，以遂其「失之東隅，收之桑榆」之利益，是項傳說——亦非無因。</p>
<p>(2) "Gain from Loss" Policy: Although the export of lump coal is restricted, Hongji Coal dross, which is used as a raw material for making coal balls, is shipped in large quantities. Warehouses are piled up with 20,000 to 30,000 tons of inventory, making it difficult to promote sales. Dealers have to bear various burdens such as loan interest and warehouse rent, doing the work for others and gaining very little. Therefore, they have to recoup their losses from lump coal in order to achieve the benefit of "losing at sunrise and gaining at sunset." This rumor is not without reason.</p>
<p>（三）漲價不得其時　淸銷時節，突然加價，雖爲一般人引作可異，但其中實有隱情，蓋去年冬間，某行所出棧單，實超定額，倘一旦加價，不但自身難受實惠，且徒予囤戶造機會，擾亂市塲，故隱忍不發，直待最近存單出淸，方告加價，結果，囤戶不但無利可獲，抑且賠本拆息，為他人作牛馬耳，故曰，為有計劃之加價，非漲價不得其時！</p>
<p>(3) The Price Increase Was Not Timely: Suddenly raising prices during the sales season is considered strange by most people, but there are hidden reasons. Last winter, a certain dealer issued warehouse receipts that exceeded the quota. If the price had been increased then, not only would the dealer not have benefited, but it would have created opportunities for hoarders to disrupt the market. Therefore, they endured it and did not raise prices until recently when the warehouse receipts were cleared. As a result, hoarders not only did not profit, but also lost money on interest and worked for others. Therefore, it can be said that the price increase was planned and the time was not chosen arbitrarily!</p>
<p>結果，卻苦了一般薪水階級的平民，米珠薪桂，難乎爲生。</p>
<p>As a result, it is the ordinary people in the salaried class who suffer. Rice is as precious as pearls, and firewood is as expensive as cassia. It is difficult to make a living.</p>

<p>The black market for securities gradually weakened from hovering yesterday. Large bullish investors, unable to reverse their positions, continued to struggle to push prices up. Bears waited for the right time to act, but did not increase their positions. Therefore, although market prices were weak, there were few transactions. There were no clear signs domestically or internationally. Given that the interest payment period was approaching, unless there were major incidents, market prices were not expected to change drastically. Yesterday's developments: At the opening, Tian Sheng Runli bought slightly, and No. 35 was already selling. Market prices were initially strong but then weakened. Later, Ren Chang Cheng, Kang Yuji, and No. 49 all sold. Although No. 20 tried to push prices up, it was not widespread. Wuding was firm, and the rest were slightly soft. In the afternoon, Xin Feng Yonglian, He Runli, Shen Yi Le Mao, and No. 11 all sold. Although No. 13 and No. 22 bought, the market still felt oversupplied. Later, No. 20 tried to push prices up again, which stabilized the market slightly, but it was still 1-2 jiao lower than in the morning. As a result, market prices were slightly lower, ranging from 1 jiao to 3.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 500,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>

<p>Ye Guang Company reported that yesterday was the largest periodic settlement day in months. The market atmosphere continued to be enthusiastic and strong. Trading was most prominent in agricultural stocks and Ye Guang stocks. Agricultural stocks were widely traded. Although many large bullish investors took profits and sold, the transaction price reached 7 yuan and several jiao. The company's coal production in May reached 11,550 tons, which was satisfactory. It was also believed that interim interest would be distributed soon. Ye Guang stock prices rose sharply from 9.3 yuan to 10 yuan. The reason for this increase was not easy to understand. However, the company's current rental income has greatly increased. However, in the Hongkou area, the company holds a large portion of the property, which now seems to have developed. However, it is only a wish. The share price of International Trust was 4.9 yuan, and the share price of Yangzi Silver Company was 7.7 yuan, both stable. Sihai stock continued to rise and was traded at 8.9 yuan. There was also demand for steel stocks, which rose sharply to 6.4 yuan. Telephone stocks were slightly firm and were traded at 100 yuan (ex-dividend).</p>
<p>橡皮股市平靜而堅挺、見有多頭者結算其近日來之盈利、太拿馬拉股成交二元、及英楂華股價十六元七角、橡皮信託股有良好需求、堅持於四元九角五分之價、</p>
<p>The rubber stock market was calm and firm. Several bullish investors settled their recent profits. Ta Na Ma La stocks were traded at 2 yuan, and British Zha Hua stocks were priced at 16.7 yuan. There was good demand for rubber trust stocks, which held firm at a price of 4.95 yuan.</p>

<p>The reorganization plan of China Business Company has been approved by the US court. Despite this, the value of the company's common stock and 8% bonds continued to be contradictory. The common stock price was 2 jiao and 8 fen, with a certain amount of trading, while the 8% bonds should have been worth 74 taels, but were traded at a price of only 60 taels.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market, which had been rising continuously, declined slightly yesterday. However, due to the shortage of goods, the price of 32-count single yarn continued to rise sharply. Tian Nuo reached 662 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous weekend. Samsung also followed with a 10 yuan increase. Other brands were relatively mild. However, the demand from various businesses was slightly sluggish. Due to seasonal factors, 10-count coarse yarn was being launched on the market for use by various cloth factories in manufacturing flannel fabrics. At the same time, there was also demand from Tianjin businesses in the north. Japanese factories had already phased out this type of yarn, so trading was even quieter. As for the factory's goods for August and September, they had already been pre-ordered, so the market price became easy to rise and difficult to fall. It was said that the 20-count yarn market continued to weaken in the afternoon.</p>
<p>現紗情形晨初開盤、市塲氣勢尚屬平靜、同業開價勿動、二十支雙馬現出價爲四百三十七元半、棧單價爲四百三十元</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news item "The Decline of Small Light Bulbs" published in your esteemed newspaper on June 3rd, which stated that factories were obtaining bare bulbs from a certain source to attach brass caps for sale in various locations, we wish to clarify that our factory manufactures all types of small light bulbs entirely in-house and does not obtain bare bulbs from any external source.

Therefore, we cannot remain silent and must request that your newspaper publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the facts. We would be most grateful. With utmost respect, Hua Cheng Electric Bulb Factory, June 4th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news item about our association published on page 10 of the third section of your esteemed newspaper on June 5th, there is a slight discrepancy in the number of tea barrels mentioned.

<h3>Today is the June 6th Teachers' Day Celebration; Schools in this City are Closed</h3>
<p>Today is the June 6th Teachers' Day. Celebrations are held annually, but this year, given the extraordinary circumstances, celebrations will be simplified. However, to mark the occasion, the Federation of Middle School Teachers and Staff and the Federation of Elementary School Principals and other organizations have resolved to close schools for one day. Schools issued notices yesterday stating that they will be closed today in commemoration. Furthermore, the refugee schools and volunteer primary schools affiliated with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the International Relief Committee, and the Tzu Lien branch will also be closed for one day. However, the institutions affiliated with the Tzu Lien headquarters will continue classes as usual.</p>
<h3>This City's Graduates at All Levels; Certificate Issuance Procedures for this Year; Elementary Schools Follow Pre-War Procedures; Middle Schools Must Submit Rosters for Approval When Issuing Certificates</h3>
<p>The procedures for issuing graduation certificates to graduates of all levels of schools in this city this year have been decided, generally following the regulations of the previous year. Elementary schools will directly issue official diplomas, temporarily suspending verification and stamping. Middle schools will issue completion certificates, and after the war is over, official graduation certificates will be exchanged, compiled, and submitted to the responsible authorities for supplementary verification and stamping. However, when issuing completion certificates, graduation rosters must first be submitted; otherwise, they will not be recognized. Universities will follow the previous procedures. The regulations for this year are detailed below: For elementary schools, each school will compile the academic records of students in school over the years. After passing a rigorous examination, they will be permitted to issue official diplomas temporarily. After the educational administrative authorities resume their duties, the schools will collect the diplomas and submit them in bulk for supplementary stamping. For middle schools, the entrance examinations will be temporarily suspended. Each school will compile the academic records of students in school over the years. After passing a rigorous examination, they will be temporarily permitted to issue completion certificates. At the same time, graduation rosters should be prepared and submitted level by level to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping. The graduation roster should include the student's name, gender, age, place of origin, past academic qualifications, grades in major subjects (i.e., entrance examination subjects), conduct grades, physical education grades, and overall average grade. After the war is over, based on the roster filed with the Ministry, official graduation certificates will be filled out, compiled, and submitted to the responsible authorities for supplementary verification and stamping before being exchanged. Colleges and universities will follow the pre-war procedures for reporting graduates, preparing rosters, and submitting them to the Ministry of Education for record-keeping. Graduation certificates must still be submitted to the Ministry. The format for the graduation certificates temporarily issued by middle schools will be standardized and printed and sold by Zhengzhong Book Company. The above procedures apply to public and private schools at all levels that have been registered. The diplomas of graduates from unregistered private schools will still not be recognized according to law.</p>
<h3>Cheng Chung Girls' School Achievement Exhibition; More Than Four Thousand Visitors</h3>

The school board members presided over the judging, and Principal Cui Jianwu, along with the entire faculty and staff, personally greeted the guests. It is estimated that over four thousand guests and parents visited from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Because the school's instruction and education are well-managed, the students' cultural level is quite high, and their achievements are remarkable. All visitors praised the school. It is also reported that the school's summer tutoring program has begun registration and is scheduled to start on July 5th. Enrollment applications are pouring in daily.</p>
<h3>How to Be a Primary School Teacher in the New Era – In Commemoration of the 28th Teachers' Day – Lu Guanliu</h3>
<p>The giant wheel of time advances unceasingly. In this decade of the 1940s in the twentieth century, not to mention the turbulent world situation, our nation and society have reached a critical juncture of survival. Since we who are engaged in education cannot transcend the real society in which we live, how exactly should we act to keep up with the times and fulfill our due mission? I believe we must have at least the following six qualities:</p>
<p>First, we must be able to recognize the trends of the times. Primary school teachers serve in real society and must guide children to adapt to the future society and become the backbone of that society. Therefore, in addition to guiding children to deal with daily life problems, we must also be able to teach them to understand the reality of current society and the trends of the future. To achieve this, teachers themselves must first have a clear understanding and a firm grasp of these things. Only when we have understanding ourselves will we not waver or doubt, and only then can we work actively.</p>
<p>Second, we must establish a noble character. Primary school teachers are role models for children and beacons of society. Even in this complex urban environment filled with evil forces that can tempt and threaten us at any time, we must be able to uphold justice and stand firm. We must have an attitude that is unyielding to force and incorruptible by wealth in order to set an example for students and lead the people.</p>
<p>Third, we must be enthusiastic about education. Education is the career of primary school teachers themselves. If we lack interest in teaching, we will certainly not have good results. We must recognize that these innocent children are the future pillars of the country and the beloved children of many parents. Their futures are in our hands. We must not neglect our responsibilities because of the busyness of work or the smallness of our salaries. Teaching is a spiritual undertaking, and spiritual rewards cannot be matched by any material price.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must pay attention to personal development. Primary school teachers must have a broad foundation of culture and rich knowledge of current affairs, so we must pay attention to development at all times and in all places. In addition to reading books and newspapers, we can also take courses to improve our skills in various specialized subjects. However, this is still knowledge from books. In addition, we must work to develop our temperament and thoughts so that we not only have rich knowledge and appropriate skills but also a kind temperament and progressive thinking to deal with things with ease and gain the trust of children.</p>
<p>Fifth, we must participate in group activities. Humans are social animals, and no one can live alone and survive independently. Especially in this day and age, we must pay attention to solidarity and organization. We must correct our reclusive habits and participate in group life. In a group, not only can we train our collective spirit and develop cooperative undertakings, but we can also get great help for our own development and entertainment.</p>
<p>Sixth, we must work hard in social work.</p>
<p>Primary school teachers are not only educational workers but also responsible for reforming society. There are many activities outside of school, and we can choose those that are necessary or closely related to social education to participate in and express our opinions in order to lead the general public. Furthermore, there are many real-world teaching materials in society that can also be used as references for teaching.</p>
<p>The above six points are the basic qualities that primary school teachers in the new era must have. If we can follow them and implement them effectively, we will not fail the mission that this great era has given us.</p>
<p>Dear primary school teachers, let us all cheer up and work hard to move forward on the path of light!</p>

<h3>Donghua Football Star Feng Yunyou Injured in Bombing in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Feng Yunyou, a core member of the Donghua football team in this city, originally worked at the Central Mint in this city. After the outbreak of the war, he moved west with the factory and settled in Chongqing. Recently, Chongqing has suffered three extremely violent air raids, with nearly ten thousand casualties. Feng was also seriously injured during that time. Friends of Feng in this city have received airmail from Chongqing, learning the truth about Feng's injury. It is said that when the air raid occurred, Feng went to an underground air-raid shelter to hide and nothing unexpected happened. However, because the alarm was not lifted for a long time, and the air-raid shelter was crowded and the air was too turbid, Feng went to the exit in the hope of breathing fresh air. Unexpectedly, in an instant, shrapnel fell and with a loud noise, Feng was crushed under the bricks and stones, and his body was seriously injured by shrapnel. When the alarm was lifted, he was sent to the hospital by relatives and friends for treatment. The letter did not mention whether Feng's life was in danger, but those who heard the news were all concerned.</p>
