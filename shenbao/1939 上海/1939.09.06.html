<p>社評</p>
<h3>義大利與歐戰</h3>
<p>德國對波蘭開火之後，英法義三國冀以勒馬懸崖。曾各有所嘗試；逾四十八小時，英法始踐行其義務，對德宣戰。英法對德宣戰之後，義國猶望倒挽狂瀾，更有所建議；及四日晚，由無綫電廣播。聲叙斡旋經過，謂英法接受所建議及原則，德元首則毅然作戰；至是，某義報指其事曰，此所聲叙，即所以示當避不復為和平繼續努力也云。近數年，歐洲糾紛擾攘，危機頻仍，英法德義實為之主角；今為和平努力至最後一霎那，而卒能獨居戰爭漩渦之餐者，惟義大利。白雲蒼狗，瞬息幻變，諸為經旬前所不及料；顧如義大利才，誠非其首相墨索里尼氏把握現實，左右逢源，理智能約束其感情，威望能控制其國民，曷克臻此哉！</p>
<p>歐戰旣作，美國嚴守中立，朝野議論僉同；然論者多謂能否貫澈初衷，始終中立，實復可疑而可憂。夫以大西洋之波濤壯闊，歐美相去數千里，美人猶不已於憂疑；則義國與交戰之雙方如法如德，壤相接，軌相通，雞犬相聞，恩怨相乘，謂爾後竟得置身局外，一如今茲乎？當前大謎解人安在？記者未欲強作解人，仍請複述前日評論所謂「於彼尙未確定如何行動之日，應保留一切論斷，以待事實上一切可能之演進」。誠以最近二日，消息之來自歐大陸與地中海者，頗有一鱗半爪，馬跡蛛絲，旣可視為珍奇可喜，亦不妨謂見微知著；忻然曰有新資料焉，堪資論斷；然論斷無論如何中鵠，何如其行動之確鑿？所可言者，今日之義大利，不但於歐局主角之中，獨居局外；抑且於世界各國之中，獨有蹶起而為最有效行動之最廣大自由。本報日前嘗論之謂世人對義國，應予刮目相看；今愈著矣。云何最有效行動？行動效騐繫於力量，別於時間空間。美國誠富且強，行動誠有力量；然對歐洲旣有其地理之空間距離，被欲發揮力量於歐洲，遂亦有其時間距離；距離所在，行動效騐必為之折減，義國不若是也。蘇聯與波蘭毘連，軍備主力陸勝於海，故以行動於波蘭，奏功當至速；然對方主力在英法，蘇聯越海以圖英法，則有甚多理由，望洋興歏，義國不若是也。美蘇猶然，他不必論。夫歐戰而曠日持久，則整個世界別為兩大壁壘，自非任何一國如義國者所得而左右；若歐戰而為相當短時間之速戰速決，則義國俯仰去就於咫尺之間，將使當之者立即有切膚之感，是必然也。云何最廣大之自由？美國限於政制，以總統羅斯福氏之雄才偉略，未能如義相墨索里尼氏之當機立斷。英美之間，雖政策與利益存有若干矛盾，然謂美國將袒德而與英國對壘，有其先天之不可能性；故美國對歐戰不行動則已，行動則無所選擇而必袒英。義國之對英法與對德國，未可執一而繩其取舍者也。至於蘇聯，對德有互不侵犯條約之關係，依據條約，蘇聯不能袒英法而抑德國：縱曰條約可得而撕毀，然無故撕毀，究不足以言自由，況蘇聯與德締約猶為發動於國策之嶄新創作，詎願毀約。義大利至少為軍事盟約而得助德，為主張和平談判而得助英法。「取之左右逢其源」。其行動有大效，且自由極矣。</p>
<p>記者行文至此而義京羅馬之電訊：「德國之武力行動，使渠認為義德兩國間之諒解，已為德方所破壞，而義國所給予之担保，因此不復有束縛效力；義國處此情勢，已決定「目前」維持其中立」。對於戰爭宣告中立，行動之消極者也；然以義國在數年來與德國之相提挈相盟好而卒至於中立，則所影響於歐戰才，決非消極之意義矣。此舉原非意外，而為本報所屢屢隱約指陳；然以一般國際變局言之，其為國際大變，雖謂較諸蘇德突然締結不侵犯條約愈甚可也。抑國際之事，動盪方殷，吾人雖得此更珍奇之更新資料，仍未宜超越現實而多所推論。義國中立，雖為明顯之動響。重要之變；然至宣告中立為止，至宣告廢止束縛為止。「目前」固惟中立而已，今後有其行動之完全自由而已：不宜論斷之為必有其他更進一步之行動，以繼其後也。雖然，竊願質之義國墨索里尼首相者，以義國今日之處境，為人類福利計，為伸張公道樹立永久和平計，不應竭義國之力量以促戰禍之短縮乎？深信義國固有短縮戰禍之有效方法者也！</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開因聞外匯轉軟，人心向榮、某金號與錢兌業等互相放盤抬價、加以售者觀望、致開市即拾高一百三十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲三千二百元、繼金號進錢兌業十兩、爲三千二百十元、時銀樓帮忽起賣風、頻來拋塞、致一度撳小至三千一百六十元低盤、但終因外匯續軟、進者漸多、某錢兌業及某銀號均有納胃、不久即抬高一百元、某銀號進錢兌業三十兩、爲三千二百六十元、時賈者雖多、但售者因聞外匯轉定、故亦尙肯供給、致盤旋於三千二百五十元左右、迨至十一時光景、市上突傳英方有對某項權柄暫交與美領之說、加之外匯允緊、同時香港帮與散戶等均有買意、遂飛躍直上、雖其間散戶及銀樓帮等均有獲利吐售、奈仍有感粥少僧多、十一時三刻、錢兌業進現金號四十兩、爲三千五百二十元、時塲中某掮客代多方力塞百餘兩、致即回挫穴十元、某掮客賣予金號十兩、及錢兌業三十兩、均爲三千四百六十元、後某錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、寬又抬高三千五百元收市、午後首開因外匯帶硬、且錢兌業均有賣意、致開市即做小七十元、錢兌業賣予銀樓帮三十兩、爲三千四百三十元、後銀樓帮亦頻來塞出、步瀉九十元、錢兌業與銀樓帮賣予某金號共五十兩、價均爲三千三百四十元、入後某金號復來猛進、且外匯又趨軟化、遂猛烈上漲、不久即飛升一百六十元、錢兌業互做一十兩、價爲三千五百元、後現金號吐予某金號十兩、價竟回落三十元、爲三千四百七十元、繼某銀號證券帮賣予錢兌業共五十兩、爲三千四百八十元、作晚收價、結果比上日回漲四百十元、收後證券帮銀樓帮售予某銀號共三十兩、爲三千四百八十五元、繼而金號吐予證券帮二十兩、爲三千四百七十五元、全天三百六十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十五元、均鮮成交、</p>
<h3>飾金好三十五元</h3>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百十五元、迨至九時半掛高五元、十時十五分叉漲五元、逾半小時後叉掛高十元、十一時半又大十元、正午再高五元、下午二時回落五元、二時十五分又回小十元、四時復掛高十五元、結果掛高三十五元、計大同行改懸三百五十元、新同行爲三百四十八元、收進的减低二十餘元不等、</p>

<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價、應一千三百十一元二角、掛脾海關金懸一元五角八分、上海標金價掛一千三百〇六元五角、英純金仍奉命暫停、</p>

<h3>外幣反動猛烈　英美金鎊升十一元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣、因外匯驟起變動、趨勢甚軟、烚赤反動猛漲、英美金鎊回漲甚劇、英金鎊漲達八十三元、美金鎊漲達八十六元、英美金票需要甚殷、市况堅昂、英金票漲達五十一元五角、美金票漲達十三元五角五分、香港票市兌堅俏、市價爲三元一角五分、坎拿大票跟隨昂貴、爲十二元、澳金票亦上升、爲三十八元、日金票趨勢微堅、爲一元一角九分、朝鮮票需要呆滯、市價爲一元零五分五厘、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱升十一元、英金票升七元五角、美金票升一元六角五分、香港票升四角五分，坎拿大票升一元二角、其他各幣無市、</p>

<h3>證劵　時局變化正多　內債一時不易振作</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況已見鬆軟、大戶多頭已感滿足、一部份已有出籠、市塲人心感於歐戰之擴大、前途演變正多、故大多頭陣綫雖尙未動、而浮多已覺把握不定、緩緩塞出、杌陧不安之人心、一時殊不易振作、歐戰勢已燎原、愈久則漫延愈廣、政府措施如何、日蘇態度如何、千頭萬緒、異常複雜、投機家乃亦如墜五里霧中，頭腦紊亂、無所適從、故市價波浪正多也、昨日交易、除二十號稍有賈進外、餘如潤利大通等所需極有限、散戶則出多進少、賣方如五號·八號·十六號·卅八號以及鴻康·順亨等先後吐售、市價初堅後疲、趨勢已有拉拾不上之象、市價結果、戊種爲廿號托住、獨好三角外、餘均小一二角、丁種又未能開出、成交總數共計的七八十萬元、茲烈簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交紗布交易所股五十股、價爲三十七元正、</p>
<p>又上海衆業公所報吿云、昨日衆業公所股市、交易數額甚鮮、但成交範圍較廣、趨勢與前無異、惟略增些許樂觀、電車股在三十六元之價、有合理需求、怡和紗廠股由十六元二角、上漲至收盤時之八角、尙有不少買、橡皮股仍被忽視、暫難振作、</p>
<p>倫敦證券交易所業已復業、行情一致下降、跌至新水準、惟遠東英商股票既照中國外債行市、均未收到、</p>
<h3>紗花　歐戰擴大　紗市新買又起　雙馬地球各漲十七八元</h3>
<p>紗市續趨前進、漲勢又起、蓋以歐洲戰爭擴大、一般神經過敏者顧慮歐亞航綫深恐停頓、紗廠需用之五金物料及原棉不能來滬、足以影饗紗廠之工作、而成本提高、因此同業新賈風允見與奮、但據客帮言、香港目前雖有採辦之舉、然船隻缺乏、無法裝運、加以內地匯款殊感艱難、以後辦貨、勢必停滯、照此情况推測下去、客銷交易之興旺無望、予紗市又遭牽肘、昨日港帮僅買三十包、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣熱烈、謂印棉暗盤大漲、塲內買者尙不乏人、開價耶漲十元、雙馬現貨爲六百元、棧單價爲五百七十四元、旋以客帮生意依然滯遲而無生色、又見回挫、迨至收盤、聞外滙改縮、買風轉强、復見上升、查半日間成交統計九百五十包、行情二十支雙馬漲十七元、雙地球漲十八元、天</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、昨滙兌較緊、加之海外棉市飛漲、因之滬上交易忽形活躍、日廠向洋行方面訂購外棉、船艙殊爲難定、况且兵險奇昂、加結遠期滙票等費、每擔需加外費約二十餘元之奇、因海上船隻不多、將來原棉尙不能准時而到、影響出品殊甚、故昨日已</p>
<h3>外電飛漲　日廠開始訂購外棉</h3>
<p>本日現棉交易、轉入停頓之途、實因紗市回升、而歐洲戰局擴大、遠東之運輸綫或有中斷之虞、一般執貨者亦不願賤價脫售、二則印棉暗盤來電、四五月期白洛去棉比週尾價飛漲二十餘羅比、以致換算要漲七八元、在此情形之下、變方談判之價目、殊難接近、至於廠方鑒於國內新棉、正在登塲之際、心思較定、且各大廠儲藏細紗原料尙不匱乏、於是雙方遂呈殭局、蘇北來源、計通州花到五百八十包、茲將新通花做開之盤列左、</p>
<p>開始向同業間搜購現貨，可供紡二十四支之康波地及惠斯登售價爲一百五十元、預料棉價將猛騰也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、昨日爲美國之勞工節、美國市塲、停止交易一天、昨日印度棉市又因歐洲之戰局關係、市價猛跳十七羅比、埃及棉亦飛漲一百五十餘磅音、利物浦漲七八十辦士、</p>
<h3>糧食　粳秈驟降　虞洽卿經辦洋米　首批約八日到滬</h3>
<p>杜米各帮來源、河下無到、車輪包子共來江北蕪湖等地各新尖六千餘包、早市開手、尙有餘波、入心續佳、各貨一律喊高二三元、若高錫曾至三十九元、江北新尖三十四元。河下早晚稻三十四元、惟本街店胃忽趨呆滯、形勢反見下游、結果無論梗尖、悉跌一二元之譜、高錫粳收盤爲三十六元至三十五元、蘇同崑粳三十五元、河下早晚稻三十二元、原包三十五元至三十四元、嘉興嘉善新川尖三十元、羊圈尖三十上元、江北新尖三十一元至三十元、蕪湖陳尖三十二元、新尖三十一元至三十元、變元三十元、統計全市成交數近五千餘包、</p>
<p>客秈晨市因業內外囤戶問津、行情再大二元、旋以江北新秈、京蕪新陳秈、及江浙新尖紛紛到滬、江北秈又到三四千包、且傳洋米由法輪退回者祇裝二千包、其大部份洋米將裝中立船來滬、可在週內抵埠、因此人心向下、中决立小二三元、午市以店囤兩滯、客販甩售、乃再瀉二三元、結果反比前日小三四元、高客秈祇三十元、中關貨二十七元、後市尙軟、惟目下人心未定、市價呼吸甚大、後市升降全以到源通暢與吾爲轉移云、</p>
<p>法郵船琴拉寳號、前日由西貢裝來之洋米一萬二千包、因國際局勢關係、該輪奉命駛回西貢、該項洋米、遂兩不來、昨日又有該公司之揚子號、亦自西貢裝來洋米二百包、已於昨日下午三時許進口、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、又聞處洽卿經辦之洋米、首批一萬八千三百餘包、約八日可到滬、</p>
<h3>現粉廠盤　提升二角　麥市亦堅昂異常</h3>
<p>麪粉　昨日粉市、提漲二角、二號粉廠盤已增至六元四角現鈔、蓋由於德波戰事爆發、外麥暴漲、國麥飛騰、各廠以成本日高、非漲不可、同時回籠因廠盤提漲、囤戶更爲貪取、售價曾由六元五角增至六七角、惟午後形勢略轉軟化、因米價回鬆、及本街內地實銷、亦漸减退、人心轉趨平定也、統市成交併計的四萬包左右、實銷棧單各佔半數云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市堅昂、京鎭蘇錫等處、到源尙稱結繹、惟有一部份產區、已被某方統制、故貨方心意甚堅、而囤戶進胃亦濃、是以市面又升二角、計由囤戶辦去管店蘇州等麥廿餘車、最高價爲十元〇八分、福阜兩廠共進蘇·錫·京·鎭·丹陽等麥一萬餘包、價爲九兀四角至九元、較前盤又提高四角之譜、</p>

<h3>男子喪失了愛情後的悲哀</h3>
<p>人生有很多的樂趣產生於男女間的愛情，無疑的一個男子在被愛人擯斥後的　情，必然很垂頭喪氣地憂鬱着，有時竟至無所適從地有如喪家之狗。雖然也有粗魯的男子，會由愛生恨，採取一種殘酷的報復行爲，但這不是聰明的辦法。你應該知道，就是把妻子殺了，你是要受盡牢獄之災的！所以聰明的男子，你應得反躬自問，爲何要被一個女子擯斥？</p>
<p>女子之愛男子，正如男子一之愛女子，這是自然的本能的要求。一個健壯英俊的靑年，發現了一個風姿綽的美麗多情的女郞，必然會心向往之，甚至一見傾心，開特別快車，在短時間內發生愛情者有之，由愛情而結婚，這是很普遍的事情。至於他們的婚後生活，當然如膠如漆，組微着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，這是多麼的幸福！可是男子若於早年犯有自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，使主宰性能健康生殖腺液消耗枯竭者，則凡滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，未老先衰，神經衰弱等症象叢生，於是精力渙散，面黃肌瘦，未婚的愛人見之，必心中不滿，即有失戀的危險！已婚的妻子，因在性生活上屢屢的不得滿足，或竟全不中用，怎能不引起憎恨，演出家庭間之種種悲劇！情塲猶戰塲，戰敗者只有仰望戰勝的耀武揚威，而自己處於被屈辱，譏笑，踐踏的地位，而莫如之何！</p>
<p>奴隸是可恥的，一個堂堂丈夫，被屈辱於女子之下，豈不更可恥！如因腎虧體弱迫不獲已，那在今日醫學昌明之世，已有特效療法的發明，如能遵從中西名醫所公認的對症療法，積極服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，則於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內根治各症，化病夫爲壯士，則在情塲中自可轉敗爲勝，睥睨其雨後蓮花似的含羞之愛人，於是愛情協調了，可獲得人生無限的幸福！唯有遺精者須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以制止遺洩，則收效允速！</p>
<p>患者盛志忠君，本地人，年三十歲，婚後數年，患腦弱腎虧甚劇，略有遺精，在夫婦性生活巾，常曇花一現，或竟完全無能，所以夫婦形同冰炭，時起勃谿，辦事無精力，且有失業之虞！於是憂愁交迫，求余診治。余即囑其在五洲大藥房購服「生殖素一半打，「希米脫氏固精片」二盒，使其兩者兼服，固於三日內遺精即止，未及匝月已百病霍然，面色紅潤，精力充沛，因此，夫婦間猶如新婚矣。</p>

<h3>乳峯發育不良的有效挽救</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>丯乳肥臀衆皆迷，</p>
<p>秋波流盼魂欲飛，</p>
<p>此福何人消受得？</p>
<p>神馳直欲到香幃！</p>
<p>事實勝於雄辯，無論你這個人怎樣一面孔仁義道德，富有自制力，或曾飽經憂患。可是當你看到一位乳峯高聳，臀部丯腴，容貌昳麗，曲線豐滿的健美女郞向你搭訕購話。或是因了某種關係，與你有所接觸。那你縱然心緒惡劣，興趣索然。可是到了這個時候，也會似『春回黍谷』頓時滿面堆笑，把一腔沉鬱忘得乾乾凈凈。至於環境優良，而賦性本來叉愛好健美的人，則一旦有此艷遇，他簡直會卑躬下辭，曲意承歡，而還恐美人之不當意呢！所以健美女性，在審美觀念極度轉變，而社交叉復公開的今日。眞是佔盡了種種便宜，亨受着無窮幸福，這是多麼榮耀而可喜！但過去如會犯自凟束胸，白帶不感，先天虧弱，月經不調，營養不良，貧血咯血，多產體虧，重症侵害，致生殖腺卵巢機能遭遇摧殘，影響新陳代謝作用，則乳峯便無良好之發育，即雖有良好之發育，亦必漸漸萎癟下去，馴至平坦得一似男子。此等女子，欲不被男子所厭惡，社會所共棄，其可得乎！？唯一補救辦法：根據法國美容專家兼婦科名醫威泥基博士及余等經驗。均公認以服生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用『生殖素』，最爲對症而特效。藎此劑係前奧國生理學大師斯丹那博士積三十年之艱辛實驗而發明，故功效非常準確，服後一日夜藥力即可向全身各部透達。連服七日，便覺食慾增進，頭腦明快。服至四星期，乳部即有微癢感覺，而呈隆起狀，若繼續不斷連服一季，雖至如何萎癟的乳峯，亦可變得屹然高聳，臀部丯腴，面頰紅潤而嬌艷欲滴。</p>
<h3>遺精並不是不治之症</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>遺精症雖不痛不癢，但如因循失治，後患是不堪設想的！所以有智識的靑年，一遇有遺精症的發現，必訪求有效療法，以謀早日治愈，但市上的藥物與醫生良莠不齊，或因自己的急於見效，未能作根木治療，於是症象毫無起色，或反見增劇，因此頗有人懊疑遺精爲不治之症，這實是因噎廢食之見。至於糊塗靑年既犯自凟縱慾於前，復息遺精而失治於後，致精枯血竭，百病叢生者，那更屬愚眜而可憐！</p>
<p>這是普遍的事實，一個身體本當健壯的靑年，患有遺精症於經年屢月之後，由遺精進爲滑精漏精者有之，由精淡枯竭而影響於腦，脊髓，性三大神經，致有腦衰失眠，記憶不良，腰酸背痛，腎萎早洩，結力渙散諸症者有之，因發育機能受阻，新陳代謝作用减退，而呈發育不全，未老先衰者，那更多不勝計。此種衰弱男子，終日困頓在病痛之中，做學生者將不能繼續其學業，謀有以深造，從事工商職業者，將感不能勝任之苦，而有失業之虞，同時亦失却了丈夫氣概，未婚者有失戀危險，已婚者夫婦生活亦不能美滿，爲妻憎恨，家庭間常因此而演出私奔離婚自殺等慘劇！</p>
<p>藥對如開鎖，遺精若有特效藥，則斷無不可治愈之理。息者如能積極服「希米脫氏固精片」，即可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，收安眠止遺之特效。如因遺精或縱慾而有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，則於服後二十四小時內即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，如繼續服用，更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝作用，必可於短期內根治各症。常服更可收延年益壽返老還童之效。患者若能來本診所施行電療注射等法，則收效尤速！</p>

<h3>在慘烈的痛時當鎭静</h3>
<p>一個人在痛苦煎廹之下，往往弄得當事者手足無措，所以在此塲所，最宜持以鎭静，急性白濁患者，於初期時，病家確受慘烈的痛苦，及處嚴重恐怖之下，每喪失其如何措置此病之理智。因爲急性淋時，尿道搔痒，繼而灼熱刺痛，尿意頻數，排尿困難，膿血涓涓而流褻衣被汚，身發高熱，此時痛苦最爲難忍，同時又因顧到社會之苛責，家人之訕笑，妻孥之詬誶，故精神上亦受嚴重打擊，因受此雙重壓廹往往神色沮喪，有岌岌不可終日之勢。</p>
<p>雖然，在此痛苦達到最高峯時，尚不失爲易治之良機，但須放棄濫用强制之針藥，希圖苟且收效一時之療法，如局部之手術，不對症之劣藥，與粗劣之色素針等皆須放棄，必須以殺菌消炎利尿爲前提。就余十數年來切實的經騐，對於急性白濁之療法，以內服最新化學療法，同時注射自家菌苗，一方又用德國濾淋平流電療法，絶對可以當天止痛，即日利尿消炎，輕則三天之內，可以全愈，重則一星期中亦無不澈底斷根，絶對無遺留之淋毒，故無再發之事。因愈後可由工部局衛生處化驗，即可證明其斷根。　診時：上午九時至六時止</p>

<h3>法後備兵今晨編隊　英僑民請纓效命　德人力示鎭靜暫不撤離　英輪奉命復航郵船離滬　英官方命令對德斷絕貿易關係</h3>
<p>歐洲戰局、旣已由宣戰而入於戰爭猛烈之階段、本埠中外人士、除靜聆無綫電戰况報告外、歐洲關係各國旅滬僑民、咸以效忠祖國之忱、作枕戈待命之備、英僑方面、巳奉政府令、禁止與敵（德國）商務往來、工部局職員及格後備兵、已從事登記、惟尙未奉令調遣、英僑則以熱烈情緒、靜待政府後命、法國及格後備兵、已整束行裝、預備獻身疆塲、波蘭僑民以祖國受戰神威脅、尤表誓守國土爲自由生存而戰之決心、預料若干時間內、各國現役僑民徵調、勢將殷繁、德方僑民、因交通關係、尙未有啟行消息、然德商則受戰事影響殊烈、航行方面、英輪已奉命複航、茲將各情分誌如下，</p>
<h3>英僑志切荷戈　法兵將開越南</h3>
<p>在滬英僑　紛請服役</p>
<p>關於上海英僑之動態、據記者深悉、上海英總領事署、四日晨通知該國僑民、應仍供原職、靜候命令、一有命令、當由英總領事再行通知、在滬英僑、自聆英王訓詞後、殊感興奮、亟欲歸幽效命、粉紛向英總領事請求登記、本埠英後備兵、均分別彼等隊伍之旗幟徽號、彼等最低限度、耍求迅即加入軍隊參戰、另據聞上海工部局英籍人員、是吾參加戰事、尙未決定、惟工部局多數雇員、已自動繕具名單、向本埠英國駐滬總領事署登記、爲後備兵或義勇軍、至於工部局警務處「Z」級英籍雇員二十餘名、已組成後備兵一團、靜待後命、</p>
<p>字林報云、據英總領署某員、昨日（四日）晨宣稱上海英僑將隨時接報紙所刋佈以及英總領事所發之訓令、彼等留於目前之職位而待官方訓示、能對國家利益作最佳之服務云、英總領署辦公處、昨因英僑數百人羣往呈交業已塡就之志願服役書、而極爲活動、上海英僑類皆已塡就志願服役書、如有必要、即爲政府効勞、少數未曾塡報服役書者、可望於此後數日內辦竣、本埠英國後備兵尙無被召人伍者、若非絕對必要、未必將召此間英陸軍後備兵、但海軍後備兵若干、有被召入伍之可能、</p>
<p>合格法兵　出發有日</p>
<p>法國後備兵一部份、於三日向法駐滬領事署撤回登記名片、據稱該項後備員不能通過醫學考試、惟其已經過登記及格後備兵員、則定日內離滬返國參戰、至行期未定、據領事署稱、該批後備兵、暫不擬逕返本國、將先送至安南候命、</p>
<p>字林報云、大批法國後備兵、星期日已向駐滬法總領署登記者、昨日（四日）均向法租界各兵營報到、從事身體檢査、然後派以軍事職務、關於此事昨雖未能自官塲探獲消息、惟聞諸可恃方面、法後備兵第一批不久將離滬、其人數未能確知、衆認尙未決定、此輩離滬者、暫不返法國、其臨時目的地爲越南、</p>
<p>法後備兵　今晨編隊</p>
<p>上海法僑　參戰後備隊、已武裝準備開拔者三百人定今日（六日）上午七時、在福履理路法軍營房、舉行編隊式、由駐滬法軍司令格里尼亞上校檢閱、屆時格上校將致詞、宣佈動員之意義、</p>
<p>法使今午　策慰僑民</p>
<p>法國駐華大使戈斯默氏、為宣示此次歐洲戰事該國政府之意志、及上海法僑應持態度、特定今（六日）午在海格路七二七號大使私邸宴請上海法僑著名人士、席間將有鄭重之表示、期使上海法僑、對歐洲現局、益趨明瞭、預料此項盛大宴會、將益增法僑之熱烈情緒、</p>
<p>波領表示　為自由戰</p>
<p>據波蘭駐滬總領事鮑霍沐雷語記者稱、母國此次對德抗戰、純爲自由獨立圖生存而戰、波蘭駐華公使魏登濤、偕同夫人及其女公子乘昌興公司之日本皇后輪返國任外交耍職、但該輪未經本埠英海軍司令邀准、故至昨晚止、尙未離滬、據魏公使稱、擬逕赴加拿大溫哥華、取道返國、</p>
<h3>德人力謀鎮定對華表示好感</h3>
<p>德僑維持　正常生活</p>
<p>字林報云、上海德僑、昨日（四日）無不努力維持正常之商業與社交生活、德國之官方及商業機關、保持循例之時間及工作、據現象察之、彼等不擬有何變更、較大之德商行、有擬謀以中立國名義登記云云、已經切實否認、德總領署人員從事領署事務、及答覆本埠德僑之無數問話、終日不息、並通知德僑、謂彼等並無顯見理由、可感焦盧、亦無須遷離公共租界或法租界、</p>
<p>德文日報　勗勉僑民</p>
<p>德總領署雖未頒正惟本埠德文日報於第一頁刋社評、規勸德僑保持鎭靜及莊重態度、並守紀律、該報切實聲明、減輕工部局與公董局肩頭所擔重負、乃此國際城市所有市民之任務云、該報出版特刊四頁、內載宣戰消息及布吿、星期日英兵襲擊跑馬廳德國網球總會事、昨已由英軍當局進行調査、聞至少已有英兵兩名、被英憲兵當塲拘獲、</p>
<p>在滬德人　千五百名</p>
<p>大陸報云、據德國駐滬總領事館消息、現有德人一千五百人、僑居上海、多數寓居法租界、本市德商行約有四十家、又據重要德商表示、彼等刻照常進行工作、惟對缺少運輸便利、不無關切、因德船均已奉令不駛上海也、</p>
<p>中德友誼　已趨好轉</p>
<p>彼等不擬撤離上海、以便利採購中國所產甚豐之錫及　等原料、主要德商批評華人對納粹政府之態度稱、自德蘇締結互不侵犯條的起、中德關係已好轉、某德僑聲稱、「吾人已獲返華人之一部份友誼與善意矣、」</p>
<p>德僑領袖　恢復活動</p>
<p>英文大美離滬未决之上海德僑協會主席格萊德、頃已乘輸返抵此間、代表德僑、恢復其活動、格氏今（五日）晨在上海德文日報刊載通吿稱、每一德僑在此嚴重時期、當完全自知保持尊嚴與紀律之必要、維持安寗之義務、應不受挑釁與有計劃之消息所妨碍、</p>
<p>貨物移出　英人倉庫</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海若干德商大商行、今（五日）晨忙碌將其貨物移出英人所有之倉庫、而轉存於第三國人、大多爲美商與華商經營之棧房中、但除此以外、公共租界之德商行、今日大多仍開門營業、九江路與四川路轉角之德華銀行、今日全晨人頭擁擠、除若干外商外、均係存戶、</p>
<p>德僑尙可　自由居住</p>
<p>聞公共租界當局、對於德僑、擬將任其自由、據華董虞洽卿氏談、此决情形、與一九一四年不同、當時英法對德、曾採取嚴厲行動、至此决戰爭、則英法雖已對德宣戰、但出於不得已、一切應付時局辦法、無不趨向於和平方面、故德僑如能在滬無越軌行動租界當局、自當許可其在界内安居樂業、</p>
<p>意國僑民　登記竣事</p>
<p>自歐戰局勢日趨尖銳後意大利雖表示暫不參戰但一般人對意國今後之行動仍予密切注意、而意國郵船汝廉該薩號滯留本埠德十古碼頭允堪玩味、昨據大光社記者向意使館方面探悉、該國駐滬總領事署、前曾運該國大使指示、早將僑民登記手續辦理完竣、旅滬僑民計一千餘名、天津一千餘名、香港方面大致相同（包括商人神父在內）、該國大使特良民、早赴北戴河避暑、的二月後可返滬、總領事策祿尼、現亦在大連避暑、本月十二三日可返滬、管理僑民之副領事及使領館各郁高級人員、均已赴日避暑、本月十日亦可返滬、該國泊滬兵艦、祗有卡祿脫一艘、士兵僅有二百餘名、其餘一艘、名葛祿尼、現已駛往秦皇島、來滬與吾未悉、近日該使領館、不第毫無舉動、且其電訊極少、</p>
<h3>英官方發通吿　與德斷絕貿易</h3>
<p>字林報云、駐華英大使館、昨日（四日）午後、發表通吿、警吿英國人民自戰爭爆發起、不得官方准許而與敵人有商業往來或其他光吻、即屬非法、除非在特殊情勢中、則將不予此種准許、違者處以重罰、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（四日）據英大使館員語記者、關於禁止英國人民與敵人交易之新條例、在滬之德奧籟猶太難民亦在「敵人」之例、然昨日（四日）頒布之條例、乃初步警吿性質、且有規定、與何種「敵方」人民貿易、即屬「無罪」之可能、</p>
<p>通知內容　計分六款</p>
<p>通知內容、（一）貿易者及船主於戰事發生後、未經官方准許、不得與敵方交易、如違反者、定嚴厲處置、（二）關於此通吿之目的、如下述各項情形、同爲敵對行爲、甲·在敵國領土內之政府行商、乙·任何人及主持者在敵人土地內、丙·各種分行貿易之處在敵國境內者、丁·公司及公團受敵國法律統制者、戊·爲敵國服務者及居留者、在敵國境內貿易者、（三）商人及個人之警吿、甲·凡與敵國有利益之偕貸及匯寄等事務、一概不准行動、乙·或有因貿易致敵國得信用我現金之收獲者、或有因貿易致敵國得從中卸脫現金上之義務者、亦均在禁止之例、丙·凡敵國已與中立國之立的人所發生之到期各債款、一概拒付、除在未發生戰事前所已付義務各項貿易外、均不許與敵國商人發生受付款項事宜、戊·絕對禁止供給有利於敵國之貨品、又不得提取由敵國輸入之商品、（四）關於戰後貿易商人之事務、與敵國商人發生在未戰以前、且此貿易與某國商行爲大宗、叉主要貿易事務與中立境內對於匯兌業務、與敵國關係債務各項情形、且債務項下以個人名義照付各款、除由英大使允許者除外、（五）支付人壽保險商標圖樣、須領取准許證、（六）所有與敵對人民交易者、槪須向英國大使館請示、</p>
<h3>英商銀行停付德人存款彙滙票</h3>
<p>自英國駐滬總領通知英商不得與敵國（德國）發生商業關係後、聞英商匯豐·麥加利·大英·有利·沙遜·等銀行、即日起對於德商之柱來、無論存款匯票等一律停止結付、又聞英商各銀行中德商之存款爲數不多、因德商洋行及個人之款、大都存儲於德商之德華銀行、並聞德商德孚·謙信·拜耳·美最時·咪吔·等洋行、已拒絕收受華商行號付給其英商銀行票據、</p>
<h3>英輪奉命復航　郵船將裝小砲</h3>
<p>日后亞后　已准開行</p>
<p>昌與公司前日（三日）自港來滬之日本皇后號、四日自溫哥華來滬之亞洲皇后號、兩輪在起椗時奉英海軍之命令、禁止出口、遂中止起程、昨據該公司云、已得英海軍之許可定昨晚十一時起椗、日本皇后號回返加拿大、亞洲皇后號、仍照原定船期、開往香港小呂宋、又據大陸報云、昌興公司之亞細亞皇后號將於接得英海軍部訓令後、駛往溫哥華、該公司人員相信、亞細亞皇后號駛抵溫哥華後、甲板上將裝小砲、如現駛加拿大之俄羅斯皇后號然、惟彼等認爲昨日離滬之最新式日本皇后號輪、將較稍舊之俄羅斯皇后號先備武裝、意輪汝廉該薩號仍泊德士古碼頭待令、</p>
<p>太古各輪　先後復班</p>
<p>英商太古公司之北洋班順天輪、原定四日開出、昨日應開往厦門·香港·之瓊州輪、均奉英海軍命令停航、昨日已得英軍當局准許、順天輪準今晨開往靑島·威海衛·烟台·天津、瓊州輪仍照原定航程、於昨晨開往厦門·香港·廣州灣·海口·北海等處、行駛長江下游北沙綫之武林輪於前晨出口後、奉令開回上海、亦定今晨復班、</p>
<p>怡生等輪　准許出口</p>
<p>怡和洋行停滬之怡生·澤生·及阜生輪等、亦得准許出口、故怡生輪已於昨日下午六時出口、開往香港·海防、澤生輪定今晨空船赴港、阜生輪定今日下午三時開往靑島·烟台、天津不去、該行之裕生輪、定今日下午由港夾滬、德生輪定八日自北洋來滬、九日開往香港、該兩輪能不是期到滬及出口、現尙未能預料、</p>
<p>安慶輪並　未遭射擊</p>
<p>昨晨本市盛傳太古公司行駛呂宋綫之安慶輪、儎重三千一百餘噸、遭某國潛水艇射擊事、該公司加以吾認、並悉該輪致電香港總行、報吿安謐、以資闢謠、但怡和·太古兩公司、在滬之各輪、已將船身兩面之英國旗幟、及「英國商船」之大字字樣、均用黑漆塗去、</p>
<p>美國增輪　駛滬歐綫</p>
<p>歐洲戰事爆發後、遠東方面英法航輪顯將减少、現悉美國總統郵船公司將派輪行駛上海與歐洲間航綫、査該公司以前祇有行駛太平洋航輸在滬停泊、歐洲班則祇走香港、並不來滬、</p>
<h3>德輪結束業務　郵船行踪不明</h3>
<p>德輪行踪　大費猜疑</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、北德公司常駛上海之香霍斯脫號、格綱賽奴號·及波斯丹號快輪三艘、現在何處、在本市乃大費推測之事、聞香霍斯脫號兩日前泊神戶、然衆認該輪現已駛離其地、波斯丹號未照原定航程、駛泊孟買、今或在印度洋、或駛往南非海岸、該輪乘客中、有上海工部局警務處人員副警監屈羅特等三人、格納賽奴號或在德國領海中、</p>
<p>力理結束　異常忙碌</p>
<p>本埠德商亨寳輪船公司、及美最時經理之北德輪船公司、業已宣吿停航、辦理結束、至北德公司之香霍斯脫前停留於日本神戶、昨日本市消息、該輪忽然離日、未悉何往、</p>
<p>大陸報云、本埠德方輪船公司、昨日（四日）忙於作結束業務之最後準備、入夜、北德公司閉門後、燈燭輝煌、而利克茂輪船公司將利克茂號輪停泊吳淞、</p>
<p>長江德輪　勉強行駛</p>
<p>其他行駛長江之德商小輪、仍分別在揚子江各岸勉强行駛、尙稱安謐、並無遭英法海軍方面之仇視或扣留、行駛滬甬綫之謀福·哈納·海福·三輪、現暫滯鎭海口外七里嶼待命、另有德商利克茂輪船公司之輪船、現改在大連停泊、尙有六艘、則早在該國沿海停泊、</p>
<h3>滬歐郵遞暢通　郵局規定路綫</h3>
<p>歐洲事擴大後、上海與歐洲方面之郵件運遞路綫、將吾變更、與有無阻礙問題、殊爲外間所注意、茲探錄各情如决、</p>
<p>郵局維持　滬歐郵運</p>
<p>昨據上海郵政管理局聯郵封發組組長徐觀琪氏表示歐洲戰事、不論其若何演變、郵局對歐洲郵遞、自當盡其可能、極力予以維持、不使稍阻閡、</p>
<p>繼續取道　三綫裝運</p>
<p>繼及上海與歐洲運遞路綫問題、照平時情形、係循西比利亞蘇彝士河及太平洋等三錢封發、其中允以取道西比利亞較爲迅速、故非經寄件人指定運遞路綫之郵件、均取道該綫運輸、</p>
<p>西比利亞　運遞無阻</p>
<p>目前該綫郵件、仍照常通遞、惟以前自上海封發寄歐洲郵件於運抵莫斯科後、即轉經波蘭運達、現在波蘭發生戰事、或須改經他道運達、惟該綫郵遞尙無阻礙、</p>
<p>蘇彝士河　現裝日輪</p>
<p>至蘇彝士河方面、自英法意等各國郵船暫時有停頓趨勢後、惟日本郵船則照常行駛、昨日即有歐郵一批裝日本郵船公司筥崎丸遝往、嗣後該綫船隻或許减少、然郵遞决可無阻，</p>
<p>太平洋裝　美日郵船</p>
<p>太平洋方面、美國總統郵船公司有船常川行駛、此後船隻或將增加、而日本商輪亦有多艘行駛該綫、故更爲暢達、惟取道該綫寄歐郵件、抵達紐的後、另須轉船運歐、時間上比較稍爲延緩、</p>
<p>歐郵封寄　規定辦法</p>
<p>旅華外僑、對於祖國安全、頗爲關懐，故郵政局邇日國外信函，至爲擁擠、惟歐局緊張、國外郵運不無困難、昨據郵政局方面表示、該局爲維持民郵起見、雖因交通梗阻、仍竭力設法疏通、茲將其歐亞各國普通·掛號·快信等郵遞辦法探錄於後、凡寄往澳洲·紐絲倫·印度支那·暹羅·緬甸，荷屬印度·埃及·太平洋各島嶼·星洲·馬來·錫蘭·菲洲·英國·及其他歐洲各國、經由蘇彝士者、皆由筥崎丸（九月四日十六點）赫斯德開克·素馬利·及亞洲皇后等輪運往、至滙兌、雖仍照常、然開匯票者减少、</p>

<h3>歐貨來源中斷　亟宜推銷國貨　國貨工廠製歐貨代替品　外滙已趨穩金市昨回漲</h3>
<p>歐戰爆發後、英法德等國行駛遠東商輪完全停駛、以致歐貨來源中斷、上海各英法德商洋行、對於已訂立之定貨契的、不得已宣吿取消、售貨以上海存貨爲限、例如類料·五金·呢絨·疋頭·工業原料等業、均存心觀望、握貨者不肯脫手、以致價格飛漲、交易混亂、一般中國商人鑒於過去之歐戰時獲利情形、粉紛向市塲買進囤積圖利、以致迭成今日洋貨市塲之畸形局面、</p>
<p>美蘇貿易　未受受影響</p>
<p>關於土貨之輸出、除美蘇等中立國外、英法德等國、均已停止裝運、以致紡織·纖維·動物及動物產品·生皮熱皮皮貨·藥村及香料等、向以銷英法德等國爲大宗、今已蒙受極大之影響、國內價格因此猛跌、以華絲而言、每担竟跌國幣一千餘元，同時黑市外匯之轉鬆、使土貨之價格回落、幸銷美蘇之茶葉·礦產·猪鬃·桐油·之主要土貨、尙未受重大影響、今貿易委會已竭力疏通輸出、</p>
<p>國貨團體　推銷機會</p>
<p>各國貨團體鑒於歐貨之堅昂、以及來源中斷之際、正國貨努力向內推銷之機會、故期望國人以國產貨品代替舶來品、直接挽回土貨滯銷之影響、間接能使整個入超之减少、而使中國國際收支得以平衡、最近上海製迭之國貨輸入內地者較前增加、此種情形實與中國抗戰有益、同時並有若干國貨工廠、仿照外貨製造以資代替、聞是項代替舶來品之國貨、質地並不遜於洋貨、</p>
<p>英法德波　對華貿易</p>
<p>英法德波四國對華貿易、受戰事影響幾趨停頓、四國行駛遠東之航行已中斷、所以自九月份起對華貿易勢必大受打擊、茲錄一月至七月貿易如下、（一）英進口四千四百六十八萬九千元、出口四千四百十三萬三千元、（二）法進口六百五十三萬八千元、出口一千七百九十六萬二千元、（三）德進口五千九百丸十萬零一千元、出口三千五百六十萬零七千元、（四）波進口三百十七萬三千元、出口六千元、</p>
<p>黑市旬滙　稍趨穩定</p>
<p>上海黑市外滙因歐戰關係轉鬆後、昨晨英商匯豐銀行掛牌、與前日相同並無變動、市塲實際行市英匯四便士六八七五、美匯八元零六二五、匯價已稍趨穩定、關於外幣交易、德金票法郞票義大利票等仍無交易、又錢兌業公會昨晨公佈同業門市買賣行市、英金鎊買七十元賣七十四元、英金票買四十三元賣四十五元、美金鎊買七十三元賣七十七元、美金票買十一元八角賣十二元、香港票買二元六角賣二元八角、</p>
<p>證劵暗市　法幣昇高</p>
<p>證券暗市昨晨昨晨開拍後、因市塲人心安定、法幣價値提高、統一各債上午略漲、下午稍跌、茲錄收盤行市如下、甲種上午五十一元四角五分、下午五十一元一角、乙種上午四十五元四角五分、下午四十五元、丙種上午四十三元七角、下午四十三元四角、丁種上下午均無成交、戊種上午四十三元二角五分、下午四十三元二角、至於中國法幣之價値、因外匯黑市之轉鬆、價値較前提高、但中央銀行之法定價格、依然穩定如恒、</p>
<p>黃金回漲　貼水低落</p>
<p>黃金暗市集會處昨晨開做後、市塲謠言蠭起、情形混亂、投機者作崇、以致價格上落甚大、上午收盤為三千五百元、下午收盤為三千四百八十元、與前日比較漲四百餘元、銀樓掛牌初為三百十五元、後改掛三百四十五元、至於匯劃貼水因市塲供過於求、因此貼水價格狂跌、昨日約一百二十五元、但是項匯劃貼水早經財政部命令取締、此後或有消滅之可能、又經營此貼水者爲一般小錢莊</p>
<h3>米價先漲後跌　洋米訂購踴囤戶不敢多進　首批平糶貢米準備報關進口</h3>
<p>本市前因米價騰貴、平民難以維持、虞洽卿等爲維持民食起見、會聯電中央、已得孔財長核撥外滙一萬鎊、訂購平糶貢米、聞第一批計一千八百餘噸、合一萬八千三百十九包、已裝挪商華綸洋行之海達輪運來、現已在途、的八日或九日可到滬、業已向江海關呈報、屆時米價常可回落矣、昨日米市河下到貨計兩船、共五百三十石、另有陸路火車運滬者達一千數百石、行家上市四千二百四十二包、均屬秈米、早市各米曾續漲二元許、晚市的跌四元、平均較前日反回跌二元左右、其餘各貨、無甚上落、原因爲到貨轉旺、米店進胃有限、且以訂購之洋米、係由中立國挪商海達輪裝運、並不受歐戰影響、而各業訂購、仍極踴躍、故一般囤戶、不敢多進之故</p>

<h3>肉巿</h3>
<p>— 茫茫</p>
<p>鮮肉業已因不願受無理的箝制，而實行停業了。</p>
<p>這實際上不是一個挺嚴重的社會問題。嚴格的說起來，豬肉祇能算是奢侈品，而不是必需物。人離開了豬肉，依舊可以活着。而且，勞苦大衆是一直離開豬肉而活着的。自從抗戰爆發以來，各方面因着經濟的拮据，不吃豬肉羣已由無產階級擴大而至小有產階級。這自然不是他們不願意吃肉，而是因爲購買力的薄弱。</p>
<p>本來，在這非常時期，祇有忍苦耐勞，纔能於自己的生命有切實的保證，推而至於國家民族，也將因而獲得不少帮助。所以，凡是任何形式的「節的」，都値得我們去推行的。那麼由被動的（受購買力的限制）而到主動的不吃豬肉，也不是一件毫無意義的事。</p>
<p>豬肉之與社會不發生重大的關係，可於上决與這决的停市中可以看出來的，兩决的停市，都不曾引起社會的騷動和恐慌，與米糧缺乏時的動亂眞是不能同日而語。原因是爲了豬肉已經成爲有產階級的私有物，而有產者是有力量以別的東西代替肉食的，因而，以小有產者和無產者佔大多數的現社會沒有爲豬肉的斷絕而引起不安。</p>
<p>然而，我們却也不能無視於這一問題的發生，進一步，我們還得探求這一問題的起因與後果。</p>
<p>很顯明的，豬肉的被操縱，是有着超乎商業之上的政治作用存在的。由這一事件直接受到影響的不是整個的社會而是豬肉商，間接受影響的是屠夫。利害衝突的雙方旣是這樣單純，所以急於求解決的，必然又是豬肉商，如以下所載。</p>
<p>「鮮肉業於昨晨十時推派代表六人（計公共租界法租界虹口區各二人），赴虹口與「牲畜市塲」接洽，要求（一）取消拍賣制度，恢復秤斤原有辦法；（二）抑低售價，以維滬市肉食，該「市塲」經理松源，因該頃拍賣制度，係仿照日本國內辦法，關於取消一事，允向「興亞院」代爲提出要求，同時勸吿肉業即日復業，並的定各代表定期赴「興亞院」請求。」（本報）</p>
<p>在這短短的一段新聞中，把雙方的態度已經寫得十分明白。並且我們相信鮮肉業的如此交涉，不會得到結果的。這我們又可以從「豬肉旣非舶來品爲何價格飛漲一以及上次停業的結果來證明的。即使這决表面上對方讓步一點，可是誰都難保第三决「豬肉事件」不再發生。</p>
<p>猪肉商爲什麽要這樣做呢？明白的說，爲了維持自身的利益。而對方呢，則是在搜括「長期戰爭」的資本。我們祗要稍稍來權衡一下利害得失，魷會覺得鮮肉業現在所走的並不是一條最好的路。</p>
<p>是的，鮮肉業目前消極的抵制，暫時祇有是停市，因爲停市雖損失了自己的利益，同時也破壊了對方的企圖。也許，妨害了他們自身利益時，會有眞正的讓步。在這鬥爭的過程中，受累的當然是鮮肉業的一些雇員——屠夫，所好是他們身强力壯，能够獲得業主的一點帮助，餓死也還不致於。</p>
<p>我們並不絕對的反對吃猪肉，我們也同情鮮肉業的處境和遭遇：但，我們不願意吃毒害自身的猪肉！</p>
<h3>羊毛出在羊身上？</h3>
<p>— 弱者</p>
<p>上月的本刊上，有位三房客寫了一篇「大房東二房東的如意算盤」，那種唯恐天下不亂的發財心理，幾乎映在愛克斯燈前一樣，讓我輩做三房客的看了個淸淸楚楚。但是看淸楚了又怎樣？三十元一間亭子樓，一百元一間統廂房，無眷莫問，無保不租，押租多少，小費若干，名目之多，駭人聽聞！從前有人說「上海人搬塲如老鼠搬家」，現在不要說搬家，一個單身漢子想找一個藉以避風雨之棲，也並不是便宜的事了。即使是幸而條件較爲優越，捷足先登，自己再省吃儉用，希圖度此難關，可是混水里摸魚的漁翁決不會放棄每一個飛來的機會的，一有什麼風吹草動，羊毛不但出在羊身上，反而要超收羊毛者而上之。我們都是戰後租賃的房子，其房價不知超出比例數十倍以外，但是地捐增價的時候，二房東馬上按戶分攤，而總數的百分之幾十，在超出比例數十倍的房租上分攤，這集腋成裘的百分之幾十，不又是一筆小小橫財嗎？現在電力又增價了，公共租界是百分之一百十二，法租界百分之六十（前增百分之十五在內），這一支鶏毛令箭，二房東又振振有詞，立即按戶分攤。譬如我是住在法租界的，一個前樓的租價是三十五元，上决地捐水費增價的時候「分攤」着二成，計時價四十二元。電燈是規定的一盞三十二支光，如果憑良心說，二房東也該滿意的了，即算現在電費又增加百分之四十五，一盞三十二支光燈的百分之四十五，其數至微，可是他的「分攤」辦法也眞高明：他們以整個屋干一裏的燈頭來計算，計算之下，每燈增費一元。這辦法初看是非常公允的，可是按之實際呢，聽我道來：三房客的電燈是下午六時開燈，十二時熄燈，亮的時候計六小時；他們的電燈光大，通宵外，還有電扇，電熨斗等等，在這樣不平均的消費比例下，要按戶分攤，，羊毛出在羊身上，還是一句太漂亮的話哩！</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　海外豓聞忽迎桃葉　火中景竟粲蓮花</p>
<p>本來她們何家姊妹，預備下一星期，再到自由村去一回。參觀那村自治的一切，大槪她們租地建廠的事，也可由村議會決定了。但現在自由村不能去了，因爲她們的那位父執江鏡蓉，星期一要到上海來了，父親的電報上，不是敎我們到上海去給他接頭嗎。電報上面且說：所有款子，也由他匯交，我們要籌備一切，也不能沒有款子，這就非與他接洽不可。父親電報上，又說他是曾經辦過絲織物廠而有經騐者，並且也是股東之一，要我們親往拜謁他。也許他就是發起辦這個織綢廠的人。父親的電文簡的，沒有詳細的說什麼，要我們去親往見他，說不定還有許多商量之處。父親電報中特地的提到這些，也就可以見到了。並且我們此刻辦廠是毫無經騐的，這位江先生旣然父親是說他有經騐的，我們正要請敎他一切了。聽說從前辦絲織廠也很是不容易，新式的他們喚做電機織綢廠。凡辦一種工廠，對於社會的環境，也大有關係，中國一切設備不完全，工人的技術不進步，任憑你有挺大的本領，也往往弄得吃力不討好。不過中國從前的開設絲織物廠，目的只是但求銷行國內就是了，這一點，和我們意旨不大相同。若是但求銷行國內，那末現在新設的絲織物廠也不少，中國幾千年內，就是能織絲織物的國度呀。她們想：無論如何，這位江先生，父親說他有經騐者，那末終比我們沒有經騐者强了。她們這時就要去和朱愛人商量，下星期日要到上海去，不能再到自由村去了。那天晚上，見朱愛人一天的醫務忙完了，她們姊妹倆便到朱愛人房間裏來，剛剛走進去，只見朱愛人手中握着幾張粉紅的柬帖，笑嘻嘻的說道：「正要找你們咧！我們下星期，又有別地方去，不能到自由村去了。」何儷玉道：「怎麼說？我們也正要找你，也是吿訴你下星期不能到自由村法，你說要到別地方去，却是到那裏去呀？」朱愛人把手中的柬帖，授給她們道：「你們瞧！金澹雲上回在蘇州，也沒有吿訴我結婚的日子就在下星期，她這人很調皮，此刻却請帖來了。」（一七八）</p>

<h3>南鐵生初露色相　章遏雲捲土重來</h3>
<p>— 乃唯</p>
<p>黃金大戲院，秋凉開幕的第一批角兒，本來邀妥四大名旦之一的宋德珠及髪生楊寳森，武生吳彥衡等人，現在因爲天津水災的關係，故這些角兒暫時不能南來。黃金當局，爲求補救計，乃邀南鐵生來滬，（南鐵生甫於上月由滬北上）先行演唱一星期。</p>
<p>南鐵生鄂人，生長故都，縉總世家，書香門第，其父超越將軍，曾爲武漢警備司令，鐵生因居漢皐，在漢走票，有悠久歷史，其開蒙師，爲名票程君謀君。民十二，初次登台，演「玉堂春」，以其唱唸扮相，神似畹華，因有「漢口梅蘭芳」之號。决年北去燕趙，投老伶工王瑤卿門牆，瑤卿愛之甚，許爲章小山（亦瑤卿入室弟子，舊京之老票友也）後之唯一人才。鐵生之藝，悉宗畹華，自拜瑤卿爲師，乃集梅王之精華於一爐，在漢頗負佳譽，內行對之，亦多贊許。鐵生之嗓奇甜，行腔作調，固妙到秋毫也。此决由漢來滬北上，係應乃師王瑤卿之召，茲以黃金大戲院主人再三堅邀，情不可却，乃於日前趁原輸返滬，內定八日起出演黃金，三日打泡戲，爲「春秋配」「得意緣一「荀灌娘」（日塲）「宇宙鋒」（夜塲）。黃金方面，原有班底不動，新角藍月春，小玲紅，與鐵生同時登台，此外因小生一角無適當人選，乃邀得老伶工陳桐雲加入，桐雲之小生，亦稱典型，十年前在舊京，頗負佳譽，與名伶荀慧生，合作甚久，南來後退隱家居，僅數度出演於陳萌虁龍家之堂會，此次桐雲能與鐵生同時登台，牡丹綠葉，相得益彰，誠觀衆之佳音也。</p>
<p>南鐵生應黃金之邀，爲期僅一週，鐵生演罷，將由坤伶章遏雲（日前與鐵生同輪來滬）繼後，接唱一星期，小生仍爲陳桐雲，鬚生一席，正在進行邀聘安舒元或周嘯天，大的以安舒元之成份爲多，舒元已多年不來海上，如成事實，與退雲同演，屆時必有一番盛况。至於被阻於北平，行不得也之宋德珠楊寳森吳彥衡一行人，大的俟章遏雲演罷後，當可來滬。</p>
<h3>戰時新都的影院</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>重慶電影院本來並不多，在設備上比較完全的祇有「國泰」「新川」「唯一」等數家。自經五四大火後，「國泰」被焚，「新川」被炸，其他各家亦均相繼停業，而在堅苦中仍維持營業的，則祇有「唯一」一家，「唯一」的面積並不甚大，且有一部份已闢作難民收容所，所以，地位是更見狹小了。該院所映均爲「中製」「中電」出品的國防新片和名貴的蘇聯片。最近映過國防新片有「孤城喋血」「血濺寳山城」等，蘇聯片則有「高爾基幼年時代」「女壯士」「粉碎敵巢」「海上警衛」等，不久之前，該院又開映一張蘇聯列寗廠出品的反納粹片「馬門敎授」曾遭德大使的抗議而發生不少波折，結果，仍舊繼續放映，及至蘇德協定訂立，乃由新任蘇大使潘又新申請停映，該院始改映「中製」新片「好丈夫」。</p>
<p>七月三日渝市夜襲，「唯一」影院後台及銀幕全被炸去，照例是不能再行開映，但「唯一」仍堅苦不拔，抱了卓絕</p>
<p>新入影界之曹娥，現隸藝華公司。（影迷服務社攝）的精神，在炸去的一角上，搭一臨時布幕，照常開映，但祇映夜間一塲，其情境頗有馬德里的風味。</p>
<p>「國泰」影院在大火時被燒去的屋墻，今已完全修復，不日亦將開幕，該院開業目的，是以賺鈸爲主，故仍放映一貫的美國軟性片，但重慶衛戍司令部以美國軟性片不適合開映於戰時新都，聞將向該院提出警吿加以制止云。</p>

<h3>「風雲女兒」未遭「桃李刧」　袁牧之陳波兒被擄不確</h3>
<p>— 慧存</p>
<p>——鄭君里夫人黃晨自陝返渝談——</p>
<p>袁牧之陳波兒，他倆合作的影片雖然不多，可是沒有一部不是著名的作品，他們那種特殊的作風和卓越的表演，決非僥倖所致，自有其優越的天才和獨到的經騐。</p>
<p>八一三戰事發生後，他倆便離開物質和虛榮享受的孤島而至漢口，共同加入了中國電影製片廠，去年，他倆合演了一部國防新片「八百壯士」公映，頗受讚譽。後來，武漢我軍撤退，「中製」遷渝工作，而袁牧之陳波兒也就隨同西上。</p>
<p>不久之前，袁牧之受一中製」當局指派，去陝北一帶實地攝製新聞片，同時他還隨着八路軍在游擊區中從事戲劇工作。而陳波兒不久也便離開重慶，來陝參加工作。</p>
<p>最近「中製」演員戴浩自陝北返渝，據云袁牧之陳波兒於七月二十一日從晋西八路軍支隊部出發。冒險跨越警戒綫，希望深入腹地，從事宣傳工作。當路過田家柵的時候，他倆想再繼續冒險前進，忽給日哨兵發覺而雙雙被擄，袁牧之因圖脫遁，慘遭擊斃，而陳波兒則被押至「師團部」。目下猶生死未明。</p>
<p>當重慶方面得悉此項惡訊後，不禁大爲震驚，而美聯社及快訊社亦將此消息拍發各地，因之港滬報紙均紛紛登載，致使大家引起無限焦慮，但以其消息來得兀突，終屬難以置信，現在，袁陳兩人在成都的友好，已經爲此事而特地成立了一個籌備會，預備首先着手去探訪袁陳兩人的下落。要是不幸給調查明白是眞的殉難了，那麽他們就開始籌備追悼的事宜。不過據才自陝北返渝的鄭君里夫人黃晨女士談，則稱此項消息爲絕對不確，因爲她在離陝之前，曾和袁陳兩人會叙過一次呢！</p>
<p>照這樣看來，那麼袁陳兩人現在仍是安然無恙，我們在這裏祝福他倆。</p>
<h3>對於歌舞界的希望</h3>
<p>— 梁言</p>
<p>——應各自多編些有血氣的劇本</p>
<p>我想說誰也不會否認的吧，目前在上海出演的歌舞班，是在最黑暗的過程中。雖說一半是環境所造成的，但也未始不是他（她）們的自暴自棄所使然，眞好像一個方脫離了父母懐抱的孩子，從此可以放蕩不羁了。成年的以草裙舞之類的歌舞，來吸收患色情在的觀衆，以維持他（她）們的生涯。</p>
<p>我以爲目前的歌舞班，旣擁有了廣大的觀衆，也該爲社會國家盡一些責任，在歌舞中應多編些有血氣的劇本。若破除迷信，提侣國貨，救濟難民和宣揚正義等等，萬不可以爲一舉一動，環境就會來制止的。例如現在有幾班出演的「專制的皇后」和「拒毒」等劇，都是含有深義而使人易懂的佳作</p>
<p>最近我偶到大新遊藝塲，見有「雲裳大歌舞班」演出，成績尙佳，殊爲難得。該班毫無其他各班的腐敗情形，人才旣多，樂隊亦整齊，確爲歌舞班中的特出者，據說該班導演爲電影名星馬陋芬，此君對於歌舞甚有心得，預料必有一番貢獻，但我們所希望的：儘量革除歌舞班中的餘毒，和各自多編些有血氣的歌劇。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>戲忙子與吃飛的</p>
<p>且還要誇耀於儕輩之前，說是某老闆厚我，某老關厚我，越是逢到大庭廣衆的地方，或是茶酒飯館澡堂子裏，越要故意提高了調門，翻來覆去的講個不停。似他等這樣自吹自擂，時作有意的宣傳，的確是與他們有相當的進益的。他們的用意，是祇要社會上知道他們和梨園行的大角兒交厚，則逢到達官貴人紳縉富戶家中有大堂會時，就可找到他們充當戲提調，再不然就托他們代爲邀角，如此一來，就算有了進賬啦；說不定一决可以弄到個一千八百的花花，這般人倒還稱得起是頭等的戲忙子，伶人們也不敢十分輕視了他們。最可憐的單是那種死皮賴臉不留一點身分的像伙，沒事時專要往伶人的下處奔走，不論人家睬是不睬，總是坐斷了板凳腿不走，和大角兒搭赸着說話，人家理也不理，前脚走出門，後脚就聽見人家笑駡。然而他却半點兒都不着惱，一等到某角館子有戲，老早就趕着去鼓掌呌好，喉嚨喊破，也捨不得泡壺茶吃，（戲票當然是揩油了）兩手震得紅腫，惹得前後左右的正式顧客，（人家全是掬腰包買票的）嗤之以鼻，瞪之以目，但是他却滿不在乎的仍舊努力在喊，等到某角的戲一打住，園主把今天的戲份送上，居然此君也能弄個一塊八毛的進賬，這種錢雖是爲數甚微，然而開出賬來，却極難書以適當的名目。（九三）</p>

<h3>German Troops Continue to Advance Inland; Polish Army Fights Back Bravely; Germany Claims to Have Crossed the River and Advanced Eastward; Gunfire Heard in Warsaw; Polish Cavalry Briefly Entered East Prussia Yesterday</h3>
<p>Warsaw This morning, distant gunfire was heard here. The frontline situation is the same as yesterday. According to the semi-official German News Agency, battles are still ongoing in the southern province of Poznan. The Polish National Army is moving swiftly, scattering the German forces that have adopted a defensive posture and capturing many enemy soldiers. The German mechanized units that advanced towards the southern city of Bierać were met with a brave counterattack from the Polish army, which was very successful. The enemy abandoned many tanks and vehicles, and the soldiers inside were all captured. In addition, the enemy attempted to use airplanes and parachutes to transport soldiers and disrupt the Polish army's rear. However, after the local authorities and people quickly apprehended them, the enemy changed its approach, ordering its soldiers to wear Polish uniforms and parachute into the Polish rear. This is another clear demonstration of the enemy violating the laws of war. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris The Polish government issued a public announcement today stating that Polish cavalry units entered East Prussia yesterday, recapturing the towns of Bagosz and Gruszeż in the Polish Corridor, and bombed a German armored vehicle convoy north of Tyturovo. The announcement stated that the Polish Air Force shot down seventeen German planes. The battles on the Upper Silesian front are fierce, with the Polish army holding a significant advantage. There was also heavy fighting near Parachatz. Polish cavalry units have penetrated into East Prussia. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Warsaw The Army General Staff has just released its fourth war bulletin, stating: (1) The enemy is launching a full-scale attack on the cities of Tgosk and Graudenz. Despite the brave resistance of our army, it was ultimately forced to abandon them due to the disparity in numbers. (2) Battles are raging on various southwest lines. (3) Our air force bombed German mechanized units northeast of the city of Czestochova. (4) German planes continue to bomb Warsaw and other cities. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Warsaw The local radio station has just broadcast news that the German troops in the direction of Kowelli have been defeated, and the Polish cavalry is advancing victoriously, having crossed the German border. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin The German Forward Command announced its first decisive battle report today, stating that the Führer Hitler personally inspected the Corridor battlefield yesterday morning. After the German army broke through the Polish positions on the Vistula River and crossed the river, Hitler continued to advance with the army to the vicinity of the Vistula River south of Kulm. The road bridges along the way were all blown up, but the German army continued to advance as usual. The German army found many Polish military maps in the houses along the way, showing that the Polish army's retreat at that time was very dangerous, so it could not recover these important documents. Hitler went to the front line to inspect, and now the German army is approaching the northern part of the Corridor. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin According to official sources here, German troops occupied the most important industrial centers of Upper Silesia, Kattowitz and Königshütte, today. Therefore, most of the industrial cities in Silesia have fallen into the hands of the German army. Most of these factories are intact because the German army's sudden attack prevented the Polish authorities from destroying them. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin According to official sources here, since the 3rd, the German army, navy, and air force have been operating in Poland and have penetrated 100 kilometers into Polish territory. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>London News received here today states that the German troops that continue to be deployed are currently taking the route through Danzig in an endless stream, carrying many heavy artillery pieces to the front line. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Warsaw According to Polish official sources, the "isolated army" of Westerplatte bravely resisted 100,000 German troops yesterday, and that after a Polish counterattack, many towns and villages have been recovered. Furthermore, according to as yet unverified news, Polish troops have captured the city of Czestochova. (Note: This city is a famous religious sanctuary and a transportation center on the southwestern line.) Also, the Polish troops on the Gdynia-Danzig line have counterattacked the German troops, resulting in the recovery of the cities of Orwo and Kak. In addition, the city of Starachowice was bombed and recaptured. It is said that the East Prussian border front line remains unmoved after a fierce bombardment, but Polish cavalry once dispersed the German troops and penetrated into East Prussia. As for the fighting near Czestochova, it was exceptionally fierce. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle Over Warsaw; Many Houses Caught Fire After Being Hit; Polish Planes Bomb Germany for the First Time</h3>
<p>Warsaw Several German bombers flew to Warsaw at 5 PM today, bombing the city and its suburbs with intense force. It was the most intense bombing seen since the outbreak of war between Germany and Poland. Several places in the city were hit and caught fire. The Polish Air Force immediately took off to engage the enemy, and anti-aircraft batteries opened fire at the same time, shooting down several German planes. It has been confirmed that one plane crashed near Ceya on the right bank of the Vistula River, and another crashed in the central district of Warsaw. The exact number of casualties is still being investigated. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Thirty German planes bombed Warsaw continuously yesterday, dropping several tons of bombs. It was the most damage inflicted since the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Poland. This reporter saw four German planes being shot down by Polish anti-aircraft batteries at an altitude of 4,000 meters. German planes flew in groups of three to five, circling the entire city. When the German planes bombed the train station, the explosions could be heard throughout the city. The most intense bombing began at 5:15 PM. German planes dropped bombs from high altitude, and fires broke out in various parts of the city. Four German planes were hit, and one immediately burst into flames and crashed. German planes also dropped bombs on the Lowe's Building and various warehouses, which immediately caught fire. The situation became increasingly tense, and the sky over Warsaw was all red. The damage was extremely severe. All of the city's fire brigades were dispatched, and the fires were not extinguished until after midnight. This reporter witnessed a nurse covered in blood performing first aid at a first aid station near the train station. The scene was tragic. Another major fire broke out in the Warsaw City Market, one of the famous places in Europe, but this reporter was unable to immediately investigate because the air raid sirens were constant and there was no way to go out. Many streets in Warsaw were covered with more than an inch of broken glass and bricks. Stretchers were seen everywhere, carrying the wounded to hospitals for treatment. Women and children ran to escape on the streets when they heard the air raid sirens, not knowing what to do. A young woman was holding a birdcage, not knowing that the bird inside had already died. The Polish anti-aircraft units were very active. Polish planes also took off to engage the enemy, focusing their attack on the German planes that were bombing the train station. The sound of machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, and explosions filled the city. Three German planes were very active, diving three times to bomb, but they were not hit by Polish planes or anti-aircraft guns. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Italy and the European War</h3>
<p>After Germany opened fire on Poland, Britain, France, and Italy hoped to avert disaster and each made attempts to do so. More than 48 hours passed before Britain and France fulfilled their obligations and declared war on Germany. After Britain and France declared war on Germany, Italy still hoped to turn the tide and made further suggestions. On the evening of the 4th, it broadcast via radio, recounting the mediation process, saying that Britain and France accepted the suggestions and principles, but the German Führer resolutely fought. At this point, an Italian newspaper referred to the matter, saying that this statement was meant to show that it should avoid continuing to make efforts for peace. In recent years, European disputes have been rampant and crises have been frequent. Britain, France, Germany, and Italy have been the protagonists. Now, in the last moment of effort for peace, only Italy is able to remain outside of the vortex of war. The world is changing rapidly, things shift in the blink of an eye. Such a thing could not have been predicted even just weeks ago. Italy's talent lies in its Prime Minister Mussolini's ability to grasp reality, play all sides, rationally restrain his emotions, and control his people with authority. How else could it have reached this point!</p>
<p>Since the European war has begun, the United States has strictly adhered to neutrality, and the discussions in both the government and the public are the same. However, many commentators say that whether it can consistently maintain its original intention and remain neutral is still doubtful and worrying. Even with the vastness of the Atlantic Ocean and the thousands of miles separating Europe and America, Americans are still worried and doubtful. Italy and the warring parties such as France and Germany are contiguous, with roads connecting, the sounds of roosters and dogs heard between borders, and intertwining gratitude and grievances. Can it be said that it will be able to stay out of the fray afterwards, as it is now? Who can solve the current great mystery? This reporter does not want to force a solution, but rather to repeat the previous day's comment that "on the day when it has not yet been determined how to act, all judgments should be reserved, pending the development of all possible facts." Indeed, in the past two days, the news coming from the European continent and the Mediterranean has been fragmentary. The smallest sign or clue can be regarded as precious and gratifying, and it can also be said to show the trend of things. We are happy to say that there is new information that can be used for judgment. But no matter how accurate the judgment, how does it compare to the certainty of its actions? What can be said is that today's Italy is not only alone outside the vortex among the protagonists of the European situation, but also among the countries of the world, it alone has the broadest freedom to rise up and take the most effective action. This newspaper has previously commented that the world should take a fresh look at Italy, and now it is even more obvious. What is the most effective action? The effectiveness of action depends on power, as distinguished by time and space. The United States is truly rich and strong, and its actions truly have power. However, because there is a geographical distance between it and Europe, if it wants to exert power in Europe, it will also have a temporal distance. Where there is distance, the effectiveness of action will inevitably be reduced, which is not the case with Italy. The Soviet Union borders Poland and its military strength is stronger on land than at sea, so its actions in Poland should be most effective. However, the other party's main strength is in Britain and France. If the Soviet Union crosses the sea to attack Britain and France, there are many reasons to sigh at the ocean with nothing to be done, which is not the case with Italy. If the United States and the Soviet Union are still like this, there is no need to discuss others. If the European war lasts for a long time, the entire world will be divided into two major camps, which no country like Italy can control. If the European war is a rapid and decisive war in a relatively short time, then Italy's decisions and actions in a short space will make those who bear it immediately feel the pain, which is inevitable. What is the broadest freedom? The United States is limited by its political system. Even with the great talent and strategy of President Roosevelt, he cannot make quick decisions like Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Although there are some contradictions in policy and interests between Britain and the United States, it can be said that it is inherently impossible for the United States to side with Germany and confront Britain. Italy's relationship with Britain and France and with Germany cannot be judged by a single standard. As for the Soviet Union, it has a non-aggression treaty with Germany. According to the treaty, the Soviet Union cannot side with Britain and France and suppress Germany. Even if it is said that the treaty can be torn up, there is no reason to tear it up, and it is not enough to say that it is free. Moreover, the treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany is still a new creation based on national policy, so how could it be willing to break the treaty. Italy can at least help Germany through military alliances, and it can help Britain and France by advocating for peace negotiations. "Taking from the left and right has its source." Its actions are very effective and its freedom is extremely broad.</p>
<p>As this reporter writes this, there is a telegram from Rome, the capital of Italy: "Germany's military actions have made it believe that the understanding between Italy and Germany has been broken by the German side, and the guarantees given by Italy are therefore no longer binding. Italy, in this situation, has decided to 'currently' maintain its neutrality." Declaring neutrality towards the war is a passive action. However, given that Italy has been mentioned and allied with Germany for several years and has finally become neutral, its influence on the European war will definitely not be a passive meaning. This move was not unexpected, but was repeatedly and vaguely indicated by this newspaper. However, in terms of the general international situation, it is a major international change, which can even be said to be more significant than the sudden signing of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany. However, international affairs are constantly changing, and even though we have obtained this more precious and updated information, we should not go beyond reality and make too many inferences. Italy's neutrality, although a clear signal and an important change, has only declared neutrality and abolished the binding force. "Currently" it is only neutral, and in the future it will have complete freedom of action. It should not be judged that there will necessarily be other further actions to follow. However, I would like to ask Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, for the sake of human welfare and for the sake of promoting justice and establishing lasting peace, should Italy not exert its power to shorten the war? It is firmly believed that Italy has effective methods to shorten the war!</p>

<h3>Statement by Crew Members of Bombed British Ship: Circumstances of Distress and Rescue</h3>
<p>German Ship Also Sunk by British Warship; Greek Ship Strikes Mine, German Explanation</p>
<p>(London) Many crew members of the British ship "Athenia," sunk yesterday by a German submarine off the west coast of Scotland, arrived in Greenock today. According to reports, after being hit by a torpedo and exploding, the ship immediately tilted and the stern sank. People on the ship waited quietly in lifeboats for eleven hours before being rescued. It was witnessed that a lifeboat carrying seventy people fell from the davits, a height of thirty feet, into the sea. Most of those on board were women and children, and many were injured. The German submarine fired a torpedo without warning, and only after the explosion did the submarine rise to the surface, about one hundred yards from the "Athenia." Finally, a Norwegian ship arrived to rescue them, but its propeller struck a lifeboat, causing it to capsize. All fifty-two women in the boat fell into the water. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) After the sinking of the British mail ship "Athenia" by a submarine, all the surviving passengers have been transported to safety by various national ships. Mrs. Turner, an American citizen who recently came to England for a holiday, was also on the ship returning home. She was fortunate to escape after the disaster and has now returned here. She said, "At the time of the incident, I was standing on the deck, facing the direction of the submarine. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and the ship shook violently. I fell down. When I opened my eyes and looked around, several passengers had already been killed in the explosion. The crew immediately lowered the lifeboats, and I and most of the passengers rushed in. However, because the boat was small and crowded, seawater was seeping in very quickly. Just when we were in a state of extreme danger, a destroyer suddenly arrived and rescued us all. It was truly fortunate." According to crew member McNair of the "Athenia," "The torpedo fired by the submarine exploded near the engine room, making it impossible to save the ship. About 25% of the over three hundred Americans on board perished. There were many children on board, and after the incident, many said farewell to their parents. The sound of crying was deafening and heartbreaking." Another crew member of the "Athenia," Mr. Miller, said that at 7:30 PM on the 3rd of this month (ship time), he was resting in the cabin when he heard a loud bang, knowing that disaster had struck. He immediately rushed to the deck, lowered the lifeboats, and saw a submarine moving through the waves and turning its guns, firing two shots at them. The ship was severely damaged, first tilting to the right and then sinking by the bow." (Havas, 5th)</p>

<p>(New York) According to a Dow Jones news agency dispatch from Washington, American officials anticipate that the U.S. government may not lodge a formal protest with the German government regarding the sinking of the "Athenia," as the grounds for such a protest are questionable. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the sinking of the British mail ship "Athenia" by a submarine (with over three hundred American passengers on board), officials here have stated that if it is proven that a German submarine was responsible, it would be a violation of international law and the 1936 protocol concerning submarine warfare regulations. The U.S. government would then issue a statement condemning it. (Note: The 1936 protocol stipulates that ships carrying military supplies may be detained by submarines, but must first be questioned.)

<h3>Chamberlain Issues a Message to the German People, Listing Hitler's Crimes</h3>
<p>London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain, speaking in German, delivered a radio address to the German people today, explaining the reasons for Britain's declaration of war on Germany. He said that England and Germany are now at war because your country has bombed and invaded Poland, a free and independent nation that we have guaranteed to protect, and has refused to withdraw its troops despite Britain's advice. We have no ill will towards the German people. We are not fighting against the German people, but against a tyrannical and untrustworthy regime that not only harms its own people but also betrays the Western civilization that you and we cherish. The Prime Minister then recounted Hitler's excuse that Poland had rejected peace proposals and the way Hitler had treated Polish Ambassador Lipski in Germany, stating, "This was not negotiation, but a command. Such methods cannot be accepted by a self-respecting and strong country. If negotiations had been conducted on a free and equal basis, this dispute could have been resolved long ago. You may ask why Britain cares so much. The reason we care is because we have guaranteed to defend Poland against aggression. You may also ask why, since Britain's interests are in the West, Britain feels the need to guarantee the defense of this Eastern country. I answer this question with regret, which is that no one in our country trusts the words of your leaders anymore. Your leaders guaranteed to respect the Locarno Pacts, but they violated them. They declared that they did not want to annex Austria, but that promise was also violated. They guaranteed not to annex Czechoslovakia, but they did. After the Munich Conference, they declared that they would no longer covet European land, but they broke their word. They have sworn for years that Bolshevism is their mortal enemy, but today they are comrades with this ideology. Can you consider their promises worth the paper they are written on? The German-Soviet non-aggression pact was a cunning move aimed at shaking the peace front, but their gamble has failed, and the peace front stands firm. Your leaders, having led themselves and you into an untenable position, are now sacrificing you in an even greater war gamble, hoping to extricate themselves from this position. May God protect justice." (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a radio address to the German people in German, accusing the country's leader, Hitler, of being a "gambler" making a desperate bet. He said, "This gambler was already in dire straits and did not hesitate to sacrifice the German nation, stirring up war in the hope of getting lucky. Today, England and Germany are in a state of war. German troops have not only invaded a free country, but have also used aircraft to bomb its innocent civilians. This free country has risen up to defend itself. This is the duty of every people. The British government has done everything in its power to prevent war, and this is known to all. I now wish to state clearly to you that England has now decided to wage a great war. However, we are not attacking the German nation, but the brutal and tyrannical National Socialist government. I offer this message with sincerity, and I hope you will consider it carefully."

<h3>Mussolini's Declaration: Italy Temporarily Remains Neutral, Military Preparations Continue Unabated, Southern Russia and Other Countries Declare Neutrality</h3>
<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini made an important speech here today, declaring that Italy would maintain neutrality for the time being. He stated that Germany informed Italy a week ago of its intention to resolve the Danzig issue by force. This notification came at a time when he was actively pursuing a peaceful solution through negotiations. In light of Germany's actions, he felt that his understanding with Germany had been violated by the German side, and the guarantees given by Italy were therefore no longer binding. Italy, in this situation, has decided to maintain its neutrality for the time being, the above remarks have been broadcast to the whole country by wireless radio. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Beijing - The smaller European countries are now seeking refuge in declarations of neutrality. Italy also shows no sign of participating in the war. Therefore, it appears that Germany is currently fighting against England, France, and Poland with its own strength. According to a telegram from the capital of Hungary, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria are currently in consultation to form a neutral bloc. On the other hand, the countries bordering the Persian Gulf and the Baltic countries have declared neutrality. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome - The fact that the Roman Catholic Church has formally announced today that its ships will continue to cross the Atlantic Ocean can be seen as another indication that Italy intends to maintain neutrality in the European war, at least temporarily avoiding joining it.

<p>Rome - The Italian government today ordered a ban on the export of fifty-seven kinds of goods, including aircraft, automobiles, motorcycles, ships, steel, gold, iron, aluminum, lead, zinc, copper, cotton, silk, wood, soap, oils, and other minerals. Among the food items, butter, lemons, olive oil, and sweet potatoes are included. At the same time, the government can freely requisition gasoline and lubricating oil. This action is a common preparation for war. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>

<p>The Yugoslav government yesterday published an official gazette confirming the country's determination to adhere to a policy of neutrality. The gazette stated, "Serious events are happening in the world. Upholding a policy of neutrality is Yugoslavia's duty. Yugoslavia has been pursuing this policy for five years, with the responsibility of maintaining good relations with neighboring countries and safeguarding national autonomy and territorial integrity. Yugoslavia firmly believes that continuing to pursue a policy of neutrality can not only protect Yugoslavia's major interests but also promote peace between nations. At this time of tense situation, it is hoped that the people of the whole country will sincerely support the government's policy of neutrality." (Haitong Telegram, 5th)</p>

This is a direct telegram from the capital of Bulgaria. Bulgaria is maintaining a strict neutral attitude. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital - The Romanian government will issue a declaration of neutrality in the near future, stating the country's attitude towards the current situation. Political figures here stated that Romania has not yet issued a declaration because it must wait for Hungary to issue such a declaration before making a decision. Public opinion throughout the country advocates that Romania should avoid being involved in the war unless it is to protect its own territory. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3>Czech Nationality: Formation of Foreign Legion to Aid Poland in Combat</h3>
<p>Paris - Czechs and Slovaks have begun forming a foreign legion within Poland, raising hopes for the restoration of Czechoslovakia. Political figures here recently declared that although Czechoslovakia is in fact occupied by German troops, in theory, all countries that have not formally recognized the fait accompli still consider Czechoslovakia to exist. President Beneš telegraphed British Prime Minister Chamberlain the day before yesterday, stating that the Czech people also consider themselves at war with Germany. Now that Poland has allowed Slovaks and Czechs to form foreign legions while retaining their original nationalities to fight alongside the Polish army, it can be seen that Beneš's declaration of principle has been put into practice. After the formation of this foreign legion, it will be commanded by General Prchala, a senior officer of the Czechoslovak army. General Prchala recently issued a message to the soldiers, stating that Czech patriots all hold the determination to restore their homeland. Poland and Czechoslovakia are of the same race and have the same interests, both being threatened by Pan-Germanism. The policy pursued by Germany is to make the peoples of Central Europe hate each other, such as inciting Slovaks against Czechs, inciting Hungarians against Slovaks, and so on. At this moment, the crisis created by Germany has made all nations unite to resist. This is Germany's own fault. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Policy on the European War: Non-Intervention, Formally Notified to Representatives of Six Countries in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japan adopted a policy of neutrality in the European war. Today, Foreign Ministry official Sawada met with the representatives of six countries in Japan, namely Britain, the United States, France, Poland, Germany, and Italy, from 5:00 PM to 6:30 PM, and notified them in person, asking them to convey to their respective governments not to create situations that would cause Japan to abandon this policy. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Asahi Shimbun" claimed today that the correct translation of the statement issued by the Japanese government last night is "Japan will not 'intervene' in the European war, but will concentrate on resolving the China Incident." The text deliberately avoids the word "neutrality." In order to achieve its supreme goal of resolving the China Incident, Japan may encounter a situation at any time in which a third country in the European war is hostile to Japan. "Yomiuri Shimbun" reported that the Soviet ambassador to Japan had begun negotiations with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to resolve the disputes on the Manchurian border. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "The Japan Times" commented on Japan's decision to maintain neutrality in the European war, saying that Japan cannot ignore the German-Soviet military alliance. If this treaty extends its influence to East Asia, Japan will have to take positive action. If the German-Soviet alliance encourages Moscow to carry out its conspiracies to the detriment of Japan and commit aggression against Japan, the world situation will inevitably change drastically. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - "Chugai Commercial News" reported that the meaning of the statement issued by the Japanese government is that Japan is prepared to cooperate with third countries or several countries that are willing to work with Japan to build a new order in East Asia. Those who want to hinder the establishment of a new order in East Asia will not hesitate to take severe action to deal with it. As long as the current European war does not exceed the scope of Europe, Japan will always adopt a policy of non-intervention. However, if the establishment of a new order in East Asia is threatened by one or several belligerent countries in Europe, Japan has a firm determination and full preparation to deal with this new situation. "Hochi Shimbun" reported that Japan will be friends with countries that sympathize with and understand Japan's position and policies, and will take severe action against those who insist on supporting the Chiang Kai-shek regime. "Kokumin Shimbun" said that all of Japan's future diplomatic actions will be based on resolving the Sino-Japanese War. The newspaper believes that Japan has the possibility of taking bold actions to end the China Incident. "Nichinichi Shimbun" also said that Japan's past painful experiences have enabled it to make correct judgments and take appropriate actions in any emergency. The newspaper urged the government not to worry about building a new order in East Asia. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - As a result of the outbreak of the European war and its impact on Japan's import and export trade, the Japanese government decided to prepare a comprehensive countermeasure. In the cabinet meeting on the 5th, Aoki, who also serves as the president of the Planning Board, explained the amendment of the material plan previously drafted by the Planning Board in response to changes in the supply and demand of materials and resources due to changes in the import and export plan. Minister of Commerce Uto explained the prediction of Japan's trade situation, the unanimous views of private businesses, and the authorities' policy. Minister of Finance Aoki explained the method of suppressing speculative businesses after the outbreak of the European war, and planned to temporarily suppress them from the financial side. If it is later considered insufficient, it will also consider using strong powers to suppress it. All cabinet members unanimously approved it. With this, Japan's economic strategy to deal with the impact of the European war was established. (Domei News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>Nehru Leaves Chongqing for India</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Nehru left Chongqing at 8:50 AM on the 5th by China National Aviation Corporation plane to return to India. Representatives from all walks of life, including Zhu Jiahua and Shao Lizi, and more than a thousand people saw him off. Zhu Jiahua delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the group, stating that Mr. Nehru's visit from afar and his bringing the sympathy and enthusiasm of the Indian people for our war of resistance and nation-building were deeply moving. Mr. Nehru urgently needed to return south due to the outbreak of the European war, and was unable to visit other cities in our country for guidance. However, he believed that during his short stay, Mr. Nehru would have a better understanding of our war of resistance, and that Sino-Indian cooperation could be further strengthened as a result. Our country apologizes for the inadequate hospitality during the war of resistance, and wishes him a safe journey and asks him to convey the Chinese people's wishes for the health of Mr. Gandhi and Mr. Tagore. Nehru replied that he had been in your country for a total of thirteen days and had been repeatedly welcomed by all walks of life in your country. This kind of warm and grand welcome far exceeded the enemy's expectations and was definitely not something the enemy would dare to try. I believe that the people of your country's welcome to me is actually a welcome to the Indian nation. Sino-Indian cooperation is inevitable. I am very honored to have had the opportunity to talk with your country's leader Chiang Kai-shek and other officials. I am especially grateful for Chiang Kai-shek's hospitality. All of this will always be engraved in my heart. Now that the war has begun, the world is changing rapidly. There are many areas where the future of China and India depends on cooperative efforts. I wish your country victory in the war of resistance and Generalissimo Chiang's health. Thank you for your kindness. After Nehru finished speaking, he boarded the plane and returned south amidst cheers. (5th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Policy: Majority in the United States Agree, No Special Session of Congress Will Be Called Temporarily, Public Opinion Inclines to Aid Britain and France</h3>
<p>Washington - White House Secretary Early stated to the newspapers that the United States would maintain neutrality in the European war and implement the current Neutrality Act, which would be announced by the State Department tomorrow at the same time. "The government is currently studying to what extent the United States can cooperate without having to amend the current Neutrality Act." "And before knowing the impact of the implementation of the Neutrality Act, it does not intend to convene Congress for a special session." As for President Roosevelt's broadcast speech yesterday, "As far as I know, only four people have expressed dissent." He did not reveal who they were. In short, the people of the country have given this speech good reviews, as can be seen from the telegrams and phone calls received by the White House yesterday. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt and his cabinet members held an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday and decided to announce the neutrality of the United States today in accordance with international law. Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison stated that after the cabinet meeting, the government authorities intend to decide today whether to send warships to Europe to protect American ships carrying American expatriates from dangerous areas in Europe. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt recently convened his cabinet members at the White House to discuss the situation after the outbreak of war in Europe. Afterwards, he immediately issued a public statement to the newspapers, stating that the government is scheduled to first announce neutrality tomorrow, and a few hours later, it will announce the implementation of the current Neutrality Act. Acting Secretary of the Navy Addison also issued a statement saying that for ships of the United States and other countries that carry American refugees from Europe to the United States, I will send several warships to protect them along the way. This can be decided tomorrow. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison stated that the 116 destroyers currently stationed at the naval shipyards in Philadelphia and San Diego will be assigned to work at sea in order to implement the maritime regulations of the Neutrality Act. He also said that the US government authorities do not intend to send ships to escort American expatriates back to the country. In the future, the Navy will order all shipyards to work day and night in order to speed up the completion of the ship construction plan. In addition, the number of naval personnel, which was originally scheduled to increase from 110,000 to 116,000 between now and July next year, will be implemented ahead of schedule due to the current tense situation. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>New York - Although American newspapers across the country continue to hope that the United States will stay out of the war, the number of people advocating for the abolition of the provision in the Neutrality Act that prohibits the export of arms is gradually increasing. The Washington Evening Star stated that if the democratic countries have superior combat power, the United States has no danger of joining the war. Therefore, our best safeguard is to do everything we can to maintain the advantage of the democratic countries, except for joining the war. Other newspapers also advocate for the abolition of the ban and the adoption of a cash-and-carry method. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Naval Reserve Enlist</h3>
<p>China's Attitude Towards the European War</p>
<p>Chongqing - "Sao Dang Bao" published an article today entitled "Our Attitude Towards the European War," which stated that since the Mukden Incident, the policy decided by China has been to respect treaties and resist aggression. This policy remains unchanged to this day. China's enemy is Japan. Any country that sympathizes with China can gain China's support. China expresses sympathy to any country that is fighting for freedom and independence. China also expresses its admiration for Britain and France's assistance to Poland in fulfilling its treaty obligations to resist aggression. In fact, the current time is the time for a general solution to the European and Far Eastern disputes. China firmly believes that the Soviet Union's signing of a non-aggression treaty with Germany does not mean helping Germany to commit aggression, but is purely for its own interests. China hopes that since the Soviet Union has no worries about its European rear, it will take more active measures in the Far East from now on. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Today, the newspapers here have little criticism of the European situation. "Yi Shi Bao" reported that although China sympathizes with the European countries, the affairs there have no impact on China. China will continue to be optimistic and carry out the war of resistance. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - People in the Chinese government are still studying the situation after the outbreak of the European war. Officials from the Information Department are busy collecting reports for the Chinese government to decide on its policy. According to government officials who spoke to the Associated Press, the government will take concrete steps based on Chiang Kai-shek's principle of "befriending all countries and making Japan the enemy." Therefore, experienced observers believe that the Chinese government will adopt a "not suitable for neutrality" attitude, which is neutrality in fact. According to international law, the British and French gunboats currently in Chongqing should be detained. However, China's sympathy is clearly on the side of the British and French. As of now, the Chinese government has no intention of detaining British and French gunboats. According to "Sao Dang Bao," the organ of the Chinese army, China opposes any form of aggression. "Central Daily News" stated that China's attitude towards this European war is (1) to oppose aggression, (2) to uphold the sanctity of treaties, and (3) to uphold justice. In short, aggressors will be defeated. This is the inevitable historical rule. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to Chinese diplomatic circles who spoke to the Associated Press, due to changes in the international situation, Britain will probably not make much concessions to Japan in the future. In the past two years, Britain has sacrificed China to make concessions to Japan, such as last year's Shanghai Customs Revenue Storage and Settlement Agreement, the issue of allowing coal from Australia to be exported to Japan, and the preliminary agreement at the Tokyo Conference, all of which made concessions to the Japanese side without sacrificing China. However, the international situation finally broke out. The United States announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and Germany signed a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, which relieved the Soviet Union of its worries and completely changed Japan's position. Otherwise, Britain would probably continue its policy of sacrificing China to make concessions to Japan. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<h3>Germany Issues Large Amounts of Marks</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German News Agency announced that Germany has recently issued a large number of five-mark banknotes to meet the needs of circulation. In order to facilitate the exchange of marks, it will issue one-mark and two-mark banknotes. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London - Banking circles here criticized the German News Agency's announcement that Germany is now issuing large amounts of five-mark banknotes to meet the news of circulation, saying that Germany has not seen five-mark banknotes in recent years. The appearance of a large number of new banknotes, especially those with such small denominations, will cause Germans to recall the period of hyperinflation in the past and cause panic. According to the Deutsche Bank's statistics for the week ending August 31, the amount of banknotes in circulation increased sharply by 2,106,000,000 marks, while all gold and foreign exchange prepared for the issuance of banknotes decreased to 0.71 percent.

<p>London - Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi, under the order of the Chinese government, filed a strong protest with the British Foreign Office today against the new rules instigated by Japan, that is, Chinese customs duties in Shanghai must be paid based on the Hua Xing Bank banknotes. It is heard that the British government believes that this rule infringes on the integrity of Chinese customs, so it is expected that the British government will protest to the Japanese government about this matter.

<h3>Flood Losses in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Tianjin news, the water level in the Tianjin urban area has dropped a total of three inches in the past few days, but it rose another inch last night. This is due to the tidal waters of the Haihe River, so it has no major impact. The greatest losses from the flood were in the Japanese concession and the Nan Shi, Liuli Tai, and Bali Tai areas of Special Districts 1, 2, and 3. After the British and French concessions were blockaded, all Japanese shops, factories, and warehouses were concentrated in the above areas, mostly cotton cloth, refined sand, seafood, paper, etc. The total amount of losses is at least 400 million yuan or more. The losses of Japanese military vehicles, cement, food, metals, and leather goods cannot be statistically counted. The losses suffered by flour merchants and other industries in the British and French concessions are also more than 200 million yuan. (4th)</p>

<h3>Yunnan Province Facing Severe Plague Epidemic, Urgent Relief Needed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Recently, Dr. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Chinese Executive Yuan, telegraphed the U.S. government, stating that the plague problem in Yunnan is extremely serious, so he requested assistance from the U.S. government, such as sending experts and transporting raw materials to China to engage in relief efforts, and allowing China to refer to the U.S. experience in eliminating plagues in Panama. The Chinese government also hopes that the Rockefeller Foundation can provide assistance to China. It is reported that Dr. Bauer, chairman of the foundation, recently visited Yunnan and requested the foundation to conduct a special study of this disease. There are no accurate statistics on how many people die from this disease in Yunnan each year, but the general severity can be known from surveys in various places. It is said that Simao, on the border of Annam, was once a prosperous market, with a population of 100,000 in 1925, but now it has only 20,000 people, and 80% of the deaths are due to plague. Now, nine out of ten houses in Simao are empty, and the streets are unusually deserted. Also, according to the Ningju County Chronicles, in 1303, Governor Liu Sheng (transliteration) led 2,000 soldiers to quell the rebellion, and 80% of his troops died from plague. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu years, Ningju suffered from the plague for 30 years, so that the population was completely wiped out. In 1936, the Sino-British-Burma Boundary Commission also withdrew without completing its work due to the arrival of the plague season. According to the report of the Chinese Health Department, the blood of those infected with the plague contains malaria germs, and the patients' spleens are also greatly swollen. Also, the area affected by this plague covers 42,000 square miles, and is rich in mineral and agricultural products. Among the minerals, gold and salt are very abundant. The land is suitable for growing tea, cotton, and tropical products. The Chinese government has now allocated 1,824,000 yuan to specialize in treating this disease. Treatment stations have been set up along the Yunnan-Burma Road to engage in relief efforts. The League of Nations Epidemic Prevention Committee has also donated 1,500,000 tablets of quinine. In short, the plague or malaria problem in Yunnan is indeed a serious problem. If this problem is not solved, the geographical advantages cannot be fully utilized, and even if the transportation is smooth, it will be useless. (Associated Press, 5th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Finance: Assisted by Tightening Foreign Exchange, Gold Price Rises Sharply; Peak Reaches $3,520; Transactions Brisk, Around 2,000 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot red market conditions, which had been trending downward for days, suddenly reversed and rose sharply. This rapid change and huge fluctuation made it difficult to grasp. This situation was entirely due to the instability of the market and different views on the current situation. Industry insiders had different opinions on the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact, some saying it was beneficial to China, others saying it was detrimental to China. In short, it was difficult for the average person to foresee. But in fact, Soviet Russia will never betray its friends for glory like Germany. The opening in the morning was encouraged by the tightening of foreign exchange, and there were many buyers, so it rose to the $3,200 level. Then it rose again to $3,210. Later, due to frequent selling by pawnshops and others, it once fell back to a low of $3,160. Then, a certain gold company suddenly came in and bought aggressively (reportedly on behalf of a certain Chinese bank, or on behalf of Hong Kong clients), so the price was pulled up to $3,260. At that time, sellers were still willing to supply, and it once stabilized. Around 11:00, foreign exchange was quite tight, and the buying momentum was even stronger, so it soared to a peak of $3,520. At noon, a certain roving broker sold a lot, so it fell back to $3,460. The noon close rose back to $3,500. At the initial opening in the afternoon, due to a temporary easing of foreign exchange, coupled with selling by currency exchange companies and pawnshops, the opening immediately fell back to $3,430. Then it fell again to $3,340. Later, due to a certain gold company and others coming in to absorb aggressively, and foreign exchange softening, it soared to the $3,500 level again. However, the result was a close at $3,480, a sharp increase of $410 from the previous day. Transactions were brisk, reaching around 2,000 taels. Pawnshop jewelry also rose and fell from time to time, but ultimately listed at a high of $35. British pure gold remained suspended as ordered.</p>
<h3>Gold Bullion Rises 410 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since morning, each tael (ten ounces) initially opened higher because of news of a weakening exchange rate, boosting confidence. Certain gold shops and money changers mutually drove up prices. Sellers were also hesitant to sell, causing the market to open 130 yuan higher. Money changers traded 30 taels among themselves for 3,200 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop bought 10 taels from a money changer for 3,210 yuan. At that time, the silver shop "bang" suddenly initiated a selling spree, frequently dumping stock, which briefly pushed the price down to a low of 3,160 yuan. However, due to the continued weakening of the exchange rate, buyers gradually increased. A certain money changer and a certain silver shop both absorbed supply. Soon after, the price was driven up 100 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 30 taels from a money changer for 3,260 yuan. Although there were many speculators, sellers were still willing to supply because of news of a stabilizing exchange rate, causing the market to fluctuate around 3,250 yuan. Around eleven o'clock, news suddenly spread in the market that the British side would temporarily transfer certain authority to the American consul. In addition, the exchange rate was tight, and both Hong Kong "bang" and retail investors had buying intentions, causing the market to leap upwards. Although retail investors and the silver shop "bang" took profits by selling, there was still a feeling that the supply was less than demand. At 11:45, a money changer bought 40 taels of cash from a gold shop for 3,520 yuan. At that time, a certain broker in the market, on behalf of many parties, forcefully sold more than 100 taels, causing the price to immediately fall 10 yuan. A certain broker sold 10 taels to a gold shop and 30 taels to a money changer, both for 3,460 yuan. Later, a certain money changer bought 20 taels from a silver shop "bang", pushing the closing price back up to 3,500 yuan. In the afternoon, the initial opening price was 70 yuan lower because the exchange rate was stronger and money changers were willing to sell. A money changer sold 30 taels to a silver shop "bang" for 3,430 yuan. Later, the silver shop "bang" also frequently sold, causing the price to fall by 90 yuan. Money changers and silver shop "bang" sold a total of 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,340 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold shop resumed aggressive buying, and the exchange rate weakened again, leading to a sharp rise. Soon after, the price soared 160 yuan. Money changers traded 10 taels among themselves at a price of 3,500 yuan. Afterwards, a cash gold shop sold 10 taels to a certain gold shop, causing the price to fall back 30 yuan to 3,470 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver shop securities "bang" sold a total of 50 taels to a money changer for 3,480 yuan, which served as the closing price for the evening. As a result, the closing price was 410 yuan higher than the previous day. After closing, the securities "bang" silver shop "bang" sold a total of 30 taels to a certain silver shop for 3,485 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop sold 20 taels to a securities "bang" for 3,475 yuan. The entire day saw a fluctuation of 360 yuan. The selling price of the current brand gold of the cash gold shop was 10 yuan higher compared to bullion, and the current bid gold was 55 yuan lower than the listed gold, but there were few transactions.</p>
<h3>Ornamental Gold Up 35 Yuan</h3>
<p>The exchange rate for ornamental gold per tael from silver shops, initially Da Tonghang was still listing 315 yuan. At 9:30, it was raised 5 yuan. At 10:15, it rose another 5 yuan. More than half an hour later, it was raised another 10 yuan. At 11:30, it rose another 10 yuan. At noon, it rose another 5 yuan. At 2:00 PM, it fell back 5 yuan. At 2:15, it fell back another 10 yuan. At 4:00 PM, it was raised another 15 yuan. As a result, it was raised 35 yuan. It is estimated that Da Tonghang changed to list 350 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was 348 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Purchase Price Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>The purchase price of Chinese cash from the Central Bank should be 1,311 yuan and 2 jiao. The Customs Gold listed a premium of 1 yuan and 5 jiao 8 fen. The Shanghai bid gold price listed 1,306 yuan and 5 jiao. The purchase of British pure gold remains temporarily suspended by order.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Demand Turns Strong Again, Market Price Rebounds Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: the HSBC listed rate showed no change. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates suddenly rebounded sharply. The market opened weaker in the morning. After opening, due to the general sentiment among colleagues regarding the signing of the non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union, it was suddenly considered unfavorable to China, so sellers were not as eager as in the past few days. In addition, Chinese banks, Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric, and British banks with profits suddenly competed to absorb currency, causing the market to soften. Around 11:00, news again spread in the market that the British side would transfer certain authority in this port to the American consul. However, general merchants observed that in the current situation, whether or not police authority was transferred had no relation to the Chinese. Instead, it depended on whether the European war could be avoided from expanding, and neutral countries could remain unchanged from beginning to end. Therefore, they did not dare to happily sell foreign exchange. Moreover, the Western merchant Sassoon also came to aggressively absorb currency, making the market even tighter and softer. The closing price for British gold fell to 4 375/10000 of a penny, and the American exchange rate also softened to 7.375 yuan. In the early afternoon, the market briefly rebounded slightly because Chinese banks suddenly took advantage of high prices to re-emerge. However, shortly thereafter, Japanese banks such as the Yokohama Specie Bank suddenly came to aggressively absorb currency, causing the market to close at the tightest price of the day. As a result, the American exchange rate was tighter than the British exchange rate, with British tightening by 40625/1000000 and American shrinking by 9375/1000000. The trend for this month's futures was the same as the spot market. However, the result was that Chinese merchants still sold short, so the tightness was slightly weaker than the spot market. The swap rate became even more compressed. According to the evening closing price, the distance from British gold was 0.015625, and the difference between the American exchange rate was 0.03125. The combined monthly interest rate (excluding commission) was only 4.8% (calculated on a 26-day basis), so arbitrage transactions disappeared. Spot transactions were quite active throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Western and Hong Kong Merchants All Settle In</h3>
<p>In the early morning, the markets for British and American currencies were as follows: British currency was temporarily suspended by order due to the war, and American currency was closed due to the Labor Day holiday, so there were no incoming telegrams.

After opening, Chinese banks first came to absorb foreign spot American exchange rate at 8.125 yuan and 0.0625. Subsequently, Ewo absorbed spot American exchange rate from colleagues at 8.0625 yuan, causing the market to soften. When the HSBC listing was announced, there was no change, and when the silver equalization tax was announced, it remained exempt. Afterwards, Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric also came to absorb currency, and foreign banks were reluctant to supply currency, causing the market to continue to soften. It is estimated that Hong Kong and Shanghai Electric absorbed foreign spot British gold at 4 5625/10000 of a penny and spot American exchange rate at 7.875 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank absorbed Chinese merchants' American exchange rate for this month at 7.875 yuan. At that time, Ewo also absorbed Chinese merchants' American exchange rate for this month at 7.8125 yuan. At that time, the market stabilized for a while. Around 11:00, news suddenly spread in the market that the British side would temporarily transfer certain authority in this port to the American consul. In addition, Chinese banks and Sassoon aggressively absorbed currency, causing the situation to become even tighter and softer. It is estimated that Chinese banks and Sassoon jointly absorbed spot American exchange rate from a certain bank ranging from 7.75 yuan to half a yuan. Subsequently, they purchased and settled HSBC and Mercantile spot British gold at 4 5625/10000 of a penny and half a penny. At that time, Chinese merchants also sold spot American exchange rate at 7.625 yuan to a certain bank. Near noon, a certain bank again absorbed Chinese merchants' spot British gold at 4 4375/10000 of a penny. Extended until the noon closing, the selling prices for spot currencies in the banks were: British gold at 4 375/10000 of a penny, and American exchange rate at 7.375 yuan, which were 3125/1000000 tighter and 8125/1000000 softer than the morning opening prices, respectively.</p>

British gold notes rose by as much as 51 yuan and 5 jiao, and American gold notes rose by as much as 13 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen. The Hong Kong notes market was firm and strong, with a market price of 3 yuan, 1 jiao and 5 fen. Canadian notes followed suit, becoming expensive at 12 yuan. Australian gold notes also rose to 38 yuan. The trend for Japanese gold notes was slightly firm at 1 yuan, 1 jiao and 9 fen. The demand for Korean notes was sluggish, with a market price of 1 yuan, 0 jiao, 5 fen and 5 li.

<h3>Discount Rate Rebounds 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts fluctuated upwards, hovering around 130 yuan per 1,000 yuan. It once continued to fall to 120 yuan, but near noon, it slightly rebounded to 125 yuan. In the afternoon, those seeking cash drafts became more active, suddenly seeing a rush of 20 yuan, reaching as high as 145 yuan. Finally, it slightly fell back to 140 yuan, rebounding 10 yuan. The interest rates for interbank lending by the Money Trades Association remained listed at 2 jiao in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities: Many Changes in the Current Situation, Domestic Debt Difficult to Revitalize for the Time Being</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities unofficial market was already loose and soft. The large bulls felt satisfied, and some had already emerged. The market felt that the expansion of the European war meant many changes in the future. Therefore, although the main bull line had not yet moved, the floating bulls felt uncertain and slowly sold out. It was unusually difficult to boost morale for the time being. The European war had already become a prairie fire, and the longer it lasted, the wider it would spread. How would the government respond, and what would be the attitude of Japan and the Soviet Union? There were thousands of strands and it was extremely complicated. Speculators were also lost in a fog, their minds confused and at a loss as to what to do. Therefore, market prices fluctuated greatly. Yesterday's transactions, except for the 20th, which saw some buying, the demand for Runli Datong, etc., was extremely limited. Retail investors sold more than they bought. Sellers such as the 5th, 8th, 16th, 38th, as well as Hongkang and Shunheng successively sold, and the market price initially firmed but later weakened, with the trend already showing signs of being unable to pick up. As a result, the market price of Type E was supported by the 20th, which was the only one that rose by 3 jiao, while the rest all fell by 1 or 2 jiao. Type D again failed to open. The total number of transactions was estimated to be 700,000 or 800,000 yuan. A brief and clear table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 50 shares of the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 37 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Public Industry Association reported that yesterday's stock market of the Public Industry Association saw very few transactions, but the scope of transactions was wider, and the trend was no different from before, only slightly more optimistic. There was reasonable demand for tram shares at a price of 36 yuan. Jardine Spinning Mill shares rose from 16 yuan and 2 jiao to 8 jiao at closing, with still many buyers. Rubber shares were still ignored and difficult to revitalize for the time being.</p>
<p>The London Stock Exchange has already reopened, and market prices have fallen uniformly, reaching new levels. However, stocks of British merchants in the Far East, as well as Chinese foreign debts, have not been received.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: European War Expands, New Yarn Buying Resurges, Double Horse and Earth Each Rise 17 or 18 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to advance, and the rising trend resurged. Due to the expansion of the European war, generally nervous people worried that the Eurasian shipping lines would be halted, and that hardware materials and raw cotton needed by the yarn factories could not come to Shanghai, which would affect the work of the yarn factories and increase costs. Therefore, colleagues were clearly seen to be enthusiastically making new purchases. However, according to the passenger "bang", although there are currently purchases in Hong Kong, there is a lack of ships and no way to load them. In addition, remittances to the interior are very difficult, and future handling of goods will inevitably stagnate. Judging by this situation, the prosperity of passenger sales transactions is hopeless, and the yarn market has been hindered again. Yesterday, the Hong Kong "bang" only bought 30 bales.</p>
<p>The human atmosphere was enthusiastic at the opening of the spot yarn market, saying that the unofficial market for Indian cotton had risen sharply, and there were still many buyers in the market. The opening price rose by 10 yuan, and the spot price for Double Horse was 600 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 574 yuan. Then, due to the passenger "bang" business still being sluggish and lackluster, it saw a fall again. By closing, it was heard that the exchange rate had changed and shrunk, and the buying trend had strengthened, and it rose again. It was found that the statistics for the half-day transaction was 950 bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse rose by 17 yuan, and the price of Double Earth rose by 18 yuan.</p>
<p>In other news, Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions were tighter yesterday, and the foreign cotton market soared. As a result, Shanghai's transactions suddenly became active. Japanese factories ordered foreign cotton from foreign firms, and it was difficult to secure cargo space. Moreover, war risk was extraordinarily high, and the cost of adding forward drafts was approximately 20 yuan per picul. Since there are not many ships at sea, raw cotton may not arrive on time in the future, which will greatly affect production. Therefore, as of yesterday,</p>
<h3>Foreign Telegrams Soar, Japanese Factories Begin Ordering Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>Today's spot cotton transactions have entered a standstill, actually due to the rebound in the yarn market and the expansion of the European war, and the fear that the Far East transportation lines may be interrupted. Generally, those holding goods are also unwilling to sell at low prices. Secondly, the unofficial telegrams of Indian cotton show that the price of white Lowe cotton for the April and May period has soared by more than 20 rupees compared to the end of the week, resulting in an exchange increase of 7 or 8 yuan. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to get close to the prices negotiated by both parties. As for the factory owners, in view of the fact that domestic new cotton is being launched on the market, they are more determined, and the major factories also have a sufficient supply of raw materials for fine yarns. Thus, the two sides have a stalemate. As for sources from northern Jiangsu, it is estimated that 580 bales of Tongzhou cotton have arrived. The opening prices of new Tong cotton are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Starting to search for spot goods among colleagues, Kangbo and Huisteng, which can be spun into 24 counts, are sold at 150 yuan. It is expected that cotton prices will rise sharply.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was closed yesterday for the US Labor Day holiday. Yesterday, the Indian cotton market also soared by 17 rupees due to the European war, and Egyptian cotton also soared by more than 150 pounds. Liverpool rose by 70 or 80 points.</p>
<h3>Food: Japonica and Indica Rice Plunge, Yu Qiaqing Handles Foreign Rice, First Batch to Arrive in Shanghai in About 8 Days</h3>
<p>Various sources of Du rice: None from Hexia. The wheel buns came with more than 6,000 bags each of new jian from Jiangbei Wuhu and other places. The morning market opened with a lingering impact, and the inward flow continued to be good. All goods were uniformly shouting 2 or 3 yuan higher. Ruo Gao Xizeng was as high as 39 yuan, Jiangbei Xin Jian 34 yuan, Hexia early and late rice 34 yuan. However, the shops in this street suddenly tended to be sluggish, and the situation showed signs of heading downstream. As a result, regardless of japonica jian, all fell by 1 or 2 yuan. The closing price of Gao Xi japonica was 36 yuan to 35 yuan, Su Tongkun japonica was 35 yuan, Hexia early and late rice was 32 yuan, the original package was 35 yuan to 34 yuan, Jiaxing Jiashan Xin Chuan Jian was 30 yuan, Yangquan Jian was 30 yuan, Jiangbei Xin Jian was 31 yuan to 30 yuan, Wuhu Chen Jian was 32 yuan, Xin Jian was 31 yuan to 30 yuan, Bian Yuan was 30 yuan. Statistics show that the city's total transaction volume was nearly 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>In the morning market, the passenger indica was being inquired about by insiders and outside hoarders, and the market price increased by 2 yuan again. Soon after, Xin Xian from Jiangbei, Xin Chen Xian from Jingwu, and Xin Jian from Jiangzhe arrived in Shanghai one after another. Another 3,000 or 4,000 bags of Jiangbei Xian arrived, and it was rumored that only 2,000 bags of foreign rice were returned by the French ship, and most of the foreign rice would be shipped to Shanghai on neutral ships and could arrive within the week. Therefore, morale was down, and the price dropped by 2 or 3 yuan. In the afternoon market, the shop hoarding was sluggish, and passenger traders sold off, and then dropped by 2 or 3 yuan. As a result, it was 3 or 4 yuan lower than the previous day. Gao Ke Xian was only 30 yuan, Zhongguan goods were 27 yuan, and the market was still soft. However, the morale is currently uncertain, and the market price fluctuates greatly. The rise and fall of the future market will depend entirely on the smooth arrival of sources and our ability to transfer them.</p>
<p>The French postal ship Qinlabao, which loaded 12,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon the other day, was ordered to return to Saigon due to the international situation, and the foreign rice did not come. Yesterday, another Yangzi ship of the company, which also loaded 200 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, entered port yesterday afternoon around 3:00 pm and docked at Pudong Qichang Warehouse for unloading. It was also heard that the first batch of more than 18,300 bags of foreign rice handled by Chu Qiaqing will arrive in Shanghai in about 8 days.</p>
<h3>Current Flour Factory Prices Increase by 2 Jiao, Wheat Market Also Firm and Unusually Buoyant</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market increased by 2 jiao. The price of the 2nd flour factory increased to 6 yuan and 4 jiao in cash. This is because of the outbreak of the war between Germany and Poland, the soaring of foreign wheat, and the soaring of domestic wheat. The factories believe that costs are increasing daily and cannot avoid raising prices. At the same time, due to the increase in factory prices, hoarders are more greedy, and the selling price has increased from 6 yuan and 5 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao. However, the situation slightly softened in the afternoon, because the price of rice fell back and the actual sales of domestic sales in this street gradually decreased, and morale turned to stability. The city's total turnover was about 40,000 bags, with actual sales and warehouse receipts each accounting for half.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market was firm and buoyant. Sources from Jingzhen, Suxi, and other places were still fairly smooth. However, some production areas have been controlled by a certain party, so the holders of goods are very determined, and the hoarders' buying demand is also strong. Therefore, the market rose by 2 jiao again. It is estimated that the hoarders handled more than 20 cars of wheat from the Suzhou and other wheat shops, with the highest price being 10 yuan and 8 fen. Fufu and other two factories entered more than 10,000 bags of wheat from Su, Xi, Jing, Zhen, Danyang, and other places, with the price being 9 yuan and 4 jiao to 9 yuan, which was 4 jiao higher than the previous price.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Prices Increase More Vigorously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the obstruction of sources from the European war, there were quite a few people inside and outside the industry who purchased and hoarded foreign sugar, and the increasing momentum became more vigorous. The association divided the current spot price of 24 crude white sugar by another yuan, with 47 yuan to 47 yuan and 3 jiao at this warehouse, 46 yuan and 5 jiao to 47 yuan at the foreign warehouse, and the transshipment cargo increased by yuan and a half, with an initial division of 36 yuan, and then 36 yuan and a half. The Taikoo Car White felt more tense, rising by another two yuan. The eastern warehouse B mark was 50 yuan and a half to 51 yuan and 8 jiao, the western warehouse was 50 yuan and 7 jiao to 52 yuan, the CW mark was 51 yuan and 7 jiao, the CX mark was 51 yuan and 4 jiao, the DY mark was 51 yuan, the HX mark was 50 yuan and 8 jiao, and the H mark of the army was 34 yuan and a half to 35 yuan. The current spot price of Dutch red was 42 yuan to 42 yuan and a half, up 5 jiao, and the transshipment was 36 yuan, up a yuan. This cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 47 yuan, this No. 1 ice was 53 yuan and a half, and Jingming ice was 55 yuan, all up a yuan. The domestically produced Diao Qinghao Square was 4 or 5 yuan apart from the negotiator's bidding price and the line price, and the Huizhou white shouted up to 57 yuan, all without a deal, because the price level was too high, and the buyers did not dare to be greedy.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Linhuai Zai Rises Another Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Black melon seeds have been rare recently, and the market situation is still tight. Although the going is not prosperous, the opening price is still on the rise. The Linhuai Guanzi goods that opened at 32 yuan before, now open at 33 or 34 yuan. If the sales volume increases, the future market is still looking for continued rise.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rising Trend Resurrects</h3>
<p>The soybean oil rising trend resurfaced yesterday. Dalian barrel oil went from 50 yuan and 7 jiao, and gradually increased to 53 yuan and 2 jiao, with 80 barrels traded. More than 400 barrels of Kobe Raine oil were opened, and the price frequently rose from 52 yuan and 8 jiao to 54 yuan and 8 jiao. A total of 250 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, (for details, see the market price column), and 200 pieces of Yanqi oil, 300 pieces of Qingqi oil, 2,000 cans of Tianjin canned oil, 50 cans of Baiwen canned oil, and peanut oil were sold by two fewer sellers, and the market price tracked the rise of soybean oil, and a total of 30 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were opened, with the price being 68 yuan to 71 yuan and 5 jiao. Also, 40 pieces of Jiaozhou transshipment oil were priced at 54 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Trading Slightly Lively, East Piece Returns to Good</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>In recent days, the cloth market has been experiencing scarce Huainan ships, leading to sluggish sales downstream. However, factory defenses have been triggered by the outbreak of war, causing raw materials and dyeing costs to increase sharply, and there is a trend for cloth prices to rise again. Market prices are far lower than costs, and the fact that the discount rate is declining, coupled with the development of autumn sales in this street and the interior, has attracted the attention of new hoarders, so colleagues' buying and selling have become slightly more active. Wholesale transactions included 150 packages of Fugui and Earth fine twill, and there were also more than 200 boxes of blue cloth, Shilin cloth, Zhigong and Biji. The wholesale Doushihao in this street handled 250 or 260 pieces of coarse cloth, fine twill, lining cloth, and printed goods. The Guangdong and Nanyang "bang" made fewer purchases, and the Hong Kong "bang" resold various goods originally purchased. The market price for all cloth has become firm. White goods are average, and the selling price for blue cloth, Shilin and other non-fading cloths, fine yarn and thread, and other goods has risen by 1 jiao to 3 or 5 jiao per bolt.</p>
<p>East Piece</p>
<p>The market trend remains firm. This street and the Qinhuangdao and Yantai "bang" continue to demand and store goods, and more than 800 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill have been traded. The selling price for fine twill is average, and the price for fine cloth continues to rise by 1 jiao to 3 jiao per bolt. Fine Biji and Zhigong have risen sharply by 1.5 to 2 points per yard. Four Gentlemen Biji is sold for 5 jiao and 4.5 points. This street handled more than 100 boxes of various patterned goods, and 25 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong on the 6th. Due to the impact of the European war on the coal market, foreign coal will be out of stock, and cargo owners are defending against famine, hoarding and speculating, and are unwilling to sell, resulting in a market with transactions but no volume, and confusion. Until now, there have been no transactions. Yesterday, the Australian Sales Office has temporarily suspended business, and the market atmosphere is even more tense. Kaiping special block and colleagues dismantle prices. The unofficial market price has shouted 76 yuan per ton, 1st grade residue 54 yuan, 2nd grade residue 48 yuan. Foreign warehouses deliver goods, and handling is at the customer's own expense.</p>

<h3>The Sorrow of a Man Losing Love</h3>
<p>Many of life's joys arise from the love between men and women. Undoubtedly, a man who is rejected by his lover will be depressed and despondent. Sometimes, he will be at a loss, like a homeless dog. Although there are also crude men who turn love into hatred and resort to cruel revenge, this is not a wise approach. You should know that even if you kill your wife, you will suffer in prison! Therefore, wise men, you should ask yourselves why you were rejected by a woman.</p>
<p>A woman's love for a man is like a man's love for a woman—it is a natural instinct. A strong and handsome young man who discovers a charming, beautiful, and passionate woman will inevitably be drawn to her, perhaps even falling in love at first sight. It is common for love to develop quickly and lead to marriage. As for their married life, it will naturally be harmonious and joyful, creating a happy family and raising clever children. How wonderful is that! However, if a man commits self-abuse and nocturnal emissions in his youth, or indulges in excessive sexual activity after marriage, depleting the seminal essence of his reproductive glands, he will suffer from nocturnal emissions, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, and neurasthenia. As a result, his energy will be scattered, and his face will be pale and thin. His unmarried lover will be dissatisfied, and there is a risk of losing her! A married wife, repeatedly unsatisfied in her sexual life, or even completely useless, cannot help but feel resentment, leading to various tragedies in the family! The field of love is like a battlefield, and the defeated can only look up at the triumphant showing off, while they themselves are in a position of humiliation, ridicule, and trampling, with no way to change things!</p>
<p>A slave is shameful, and is it not even more shameful for a dignified husband to be humiliated by a woman! If kidney deficiency and physical weakness are unavoidable, in today's era of advanced medicine, there are effective treatments. If one can follow the symptomatic treatments recognized by famous Chinese and Western doctors and actively take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su," one can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves in one day and night. Continued use will cure various symptoms in a short period, transforming a sick man into a strong man. Then, in the field of love, one can turn defeat into victory and look down on their shy lover like a lotus flower after rain. Thus, love is harmonized, and one can obtain infinite happiness in life! However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" to stop the leakage, so that the effect will be rapid!</p>
<p>Patient Sheng Zhizhong, a local resident, 30 years old, suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency after several years of marriage. He had slight nocturnal emissions, and in his sexual life with his wife, he was often fleeting or completely impotent. Therefore, the couple was like ice and charcoal, often quarreling. He lacked energy for work and was in danger of losing his job! Therefore, he was overwhelmed with worry and sought my diagnosis and treatment. I immediately instructed him to purchase "Sheng Zhi Su" half a dozen and "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" two boxes from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and take both together. Within three days, the nocturnal emissions stopped, and in less than a month, all his illnesses were miraculously cured. His complexion was rosy, and his energy was abundant. Therefore, the couple was like newlyweds again.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>Effective Remedies for Poor Breast Development</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Voluptuous breasts and full hips captivate all,</p>
<p>A gaze full of longing steals the soul away,</p>
<p>Who can be so lucky to enjoy such a sight?</p>
<p>The spirit yearns to enter her fragrant chamber!</p>
<p>Facts speak louder than words, no matter how virtuous and moralistic, self-controlled, or troubled one may be. But when you see a healthy and beautiful woman with towering breasts, full hips, beautiful face, and a curvy figure, approach you for a conversation, or come into contact with you due to some connection, even if you are in a bad mood and uninterested, at this moment, you will smile broadly as if "spring returns to the millet valley", completely forgetting your depression. As for those who are in a good environment and naturally love beauty, once they have such a romantic encounter, they will simply be humble and subservient, trying to please her, fearing that the beauty will not be satisfied! Therefore, beautiful women have all the advantages and enjoy endless happiness in today's society, where aesthetic values have changed dramatically and social interactions are becoming more open. This is so glorious and gratifying! However, if one has committed self-abuse, breast binding, vaginal discharge, congenital weakness, irregular menstruation, malnutrition, anemia, hemoptysis, multiple births, serious illnesses, which damage the function of the reproductive glands and ovaries, affecting metabolism, then the breasts will not develop well, or even if they do, they will gradually wither and flatten, becoming like a man's chest. How can such women avoid being disliked by men and abandoned by society?! The only remedy: according to the experience of French beauty experts and gynecologists such as Dr. William Ginigi and others, it is generally recognized that taking the reproductive gland and ovary endocrine preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" for women is the most effective and symptomatic treatment. This preparation was invented by the former Austrian physiology master Dr. Staner after 30 years of arduous experimentation, so its efficacy is very accurate. The medicinal power can penetrate all parts of the body in one day and night after taking it. After taking it for seven days, you will feel an increase in appetite and a clear mind. After taking it for four weeks, you will feel a slight itching sensation in the breasts, and they will become uplifted. If you continue to take it for a season, even the most withered breasts can become towering, the hips full, and the cheeks rosy and delicate.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission is Not an Incurable Disease</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Although nocturnal emission is not painful or itchy, the consequences of neglecting treatment are unimaginable! Therefore, an intelligent young man, upon discovering nocturnal emission, will seek effective treatment to cure it as soon as possible. However, the quality of medicines and doctors on the market varies, or because of one's eagerness to see results, the root cause may not be treated. As a result, the symptoms show no improvement, or even worsen. Therefore, some people doubt that nocturnal emission is an incurable disease, which is truly a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. As for confused young men who commit self-abuse and indulge in lust in the past, and then suffer from nocturnal emission and neglect treatment, resulting in depleted essence and blood, and the emergence of hundreds of diseases, that is even more foolish and pitiful!</p>
<p>This is a common fact. A young man who should be healthy, after suffering from nocturnal emission for years, may progress from nocturnal emission to spermatorrhea and sperm leakage. The essence may become thin and depleted, affecting the brain, spinal cord, and three major nerves, leading to brain decay, insomnia, poor memory, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, and scattered energy. Due to the obstruction of developmental function and the decline of metabolism, there are countless cases of incomplete development and premature aging. Such weak men are trapped in pain all day long. Students will not be able to continue their studies and pursue further education. Those engaged in industry and commerce will feel unable to cope and risk losing their jobs. At the same time, they also lose their masculine spirit. Unmarried men risk losing their lovers, and married men cannot have a happy married life, causing their wives to hate them. Tragedies such as elopement, divorce, and suicide often occur in families as a result!</p>
<p>The right medicine is like opening a lock. If there is an effective medicine for nocturnal emission, there is no reason why it cannot be cured. Those who suffer from it can actively take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" to consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and have the special effects of promoting sleep and stopping nocturnal emission. If there are the above-mentioned symptoms due to nocturnal emission or lust, it is necessary to also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su," which can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within 24 hours after taking it. Continued use can also promote development and adjust metabolism, which can cure various symptoms in a short period of time. Regular use can also have the effect of prolonging life, rejuvenating, and returning to youth. Patients who can come to our clinic for electrotherapy and injections will receive even faster results!</p>

<h3>Staying Calm in the Face of Terrible Pain</h3>
<p>A person under the torment of pain often becomes helpless, so it is best to remain calm in this situation. Patients with acute gonorrhea experience terrible pain in the early stages, and when faced with severe terror, they often lose their rationality in dealing with the disease. Because in acute gonorrhea, the urethra is itchy, followed by burning and stinging pain, frequent urination, difficulty urinating, and pus and blood flowing out, staining the clothes and bedding, and the body develops a high fever. This pain is most unbearable, and at the same time, they are also severely affected mentally because of social condemnation, family ridicule, and spousal scolding. Under this double pressure, they often look depressed and feel like they are on the verge of death.</p>
<p>However, when this pain reaches its peak, it is still a good opportunity for easy treatment, but it is necessary to abandon the abuse of forced injections and medications, hoping to achieve temporary results with expedient methods. Local surgery, improper medications, and crude pigment injections should all be abandoned. It is necessary to prioritize sterilization, anti-inflammation, and diuresis. Based on my practical experience of more than ten years, the treatment for acute gonorrhea involves taking the latest chemotherapy internally, injecting autologous vaccines, and using German "Filter Lymphatic Level Flow Electropathy". It can definitely stop the pain on the same day, and promote diuresis and reduce inflammation on the same day. Mild cases can be completely cured within three days, and severe cases can be completely eradicated within a week, with absolutely no residual gonorrhea toxin, so there will be no recurrence. After recovery, the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department can test and prove that it has been eradicated. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>

<h3>French Reservists Formed into Squadrons This Morning, British Nationals Volunteered for Service, Germans Showed Calm and Did Not Leave Temporarily, British Ships Ordered to Resume Sailing, Mail Ships Leave Shanghai, British Official Orders to Sever Trade Relations with Germany</h3>
<p>The European war situation has already entered an intense stage of warfare after the declaration of war. In Shanghai, Chinese and foreign individuals, in addition to listening quietly to wireless reports of the war situation, nationals of various European countries related to the war in Shanghai are ready to serve their motherland. On the British side, orders have been received from the government to prohibit commercial exchanges with the enemy (Germany). Municipal Council employees and qualified reservists have been registering, but have not yet received orders for deployment. British nationals are waiting eagerly for further orders from the government with enthusiasm. French qualified reservists have packed their bags, preparing to dedicate themselves to the battlefield. Polish nationals, feeling threatened by the god of war, have expressed their determination to defend their homeland and fight for their free survival. It is expected that within a certain period, the recruitment of active-duty nationals of various countries will be frequent. German nationals have not yet received any news of departure due to transportation issues. However, German merchants have been significantly affected by the war. On the shipping front, British ships have been ordered to resume sailing. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>British Nationals Eager to Serve, French Soldiers to be Sent to Vietnam</h3>
<p>British Nationals in Shanghai Eager to Serve</p>
<p>Regarding the movements of British nationals in Shanghai, according to reliable sources, the British Consulate General in Shanghai notified British nationals on the morning of the 4th that they should remain in their original positions and await orders. Once orders are issued, the British Consul General will notify them again. British nationals in Shanghai felt excited after hearing the British King's address and eagerly wanted to return to their homeland to serve. They have been requesting the British Consul General to register. British reservists in Shanghai have been distinguishing their ranks and badges. They demand, at the very least, to join the army and participate in the war immediately. It is also reported that it has not yet been decided whether British personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Council will participate in the war. However, the majority of Municipal Council employees have voluntarily prepared lists and registered with the British Consulate General in Shanghai as reservists or volunteers. As for more than 20 British employees of the "Z" level of the Municipal Police Department, they have formed a regiment of reservists, awaiting orders.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that an official from the British Consulate General declared yesterday morning (the 4th) that British nationals in Shanghai would receive instructions published in newspapers and issued by the British Consul General at any time. They are to remain in their current positions and await official instructions, to best serve the interests of the country. The British Consulate General's office was extremely active yesterday due to hundreds of British nationals flocking to submit their completed volunteer service forms. British nationals in Shanghai have all completed volunteer service forms and will serve the government if necessary. It is hoped that the few who have not yet submitted their service forms will complete them within the next few days. British reservists in Shanghai have not yet been called to join the military. Unless absolutely necessary, British army reservists here may not be called up, but some naval reservists may be called up.</p>
<p>Qualified French Soldiers to Depart Soon</p>
<p>A portion of the French reservists withdrew their registration forms from the French Consulate in Shanghai on the 3rd. It is said that these reservists could not pass the medical examination. However, those who have already registered and are qualified reservists are scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to their country to participate in the war within days, although the departure date has not been determined. According to the consulate, these reservists do not intend to return directly to their country but will first be sent to Annam to await orders.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that a large number of French reservists who registered with the French Consulate General in Shanghai on Sunday have reported to the French Concession barracks yesterday (the 4th) for physical examinations and will then be assigned to military duties. Although no news could be obtained from official sources yesterday regarding this matter, it was learned from reliable sources that the first batch of French reservists will leave Shanghai soon. The number of people could not be determined, but it is believed that it has not yet been decided. These departing individuals will not return to France for the time being, and their temporary destination is Vietnam.</p>
<p>French Reservists Formed into Squadrons This Morning</p>
<p>The Shanghai French nationals' reserve team, 300 strong, which is armed and ready to depart, is scheduled to hold a squadron formation ceremony at 7:00 AM today (the 6th) at the French army barracks on Fuli Road, inspected by Colonel Grignia, commander of the French army stationed in Shanghai. At that time, Colonel Grignia will deliver a speech announcing the meaning of mobilization.</p>
<p>French Ambassador to Console Nationals This Afternoon</p>
<p>French Ambassador to China, Mr. Gosmar, in order to declare the will of his country's government in this European war and the attitude that Shanghai French nationals should take, has specifically invited prominent Shanghai French nationals to a banquet at his private residence at 727 Hague Road this afternoon (the 6th). There will be a solemn expression during the banquet, with the expectation that Shanghai French nationals will gain a clearer understanding of the current European situation. It is expected that this grand banquet will further increase the enthusiasm of French nationals.</p>
<p>Polish Consul Expresses Fight for Freedom</p>
<p>According to the Polish Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Bohomol, his motherland's resistance to Germany is purely a fight for freedom, independence, and survival. Polish Minister to China, Mr. Weidantao, accompanied by his wife and daughter, returned to his country on the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress ship to assume diplomatic duties. However, the ship had not been approved by the British naval commander in Shanghai, so as of last night, it had not yet left Shanghai. According to Minister Wei, he planned to go directly to Vancouver, Canada, and return to his country via that route.</p>
<h3>Germans Seek Calm and Express Goodwill Towards China</h3>
<p>German Nationals Maintain Normal Life</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that German nationals in Shanghai made every effort yesterday (the 4th) to maintain normal commercial and social life. German official and commercial organizations maintained their usual hours and work. From appearances, they do not intend to make any changes. It has been firmly denied that larger German commercial firms intend to register under the name of a neutral country. Personnel from the German Consulate General engaged in consulate affairs and answered countless questions from German nationals in Shanghai all day long, and notified German nationals that there was no apparent reason for them to feel anxious or to move out of the Public Concession or the French Concession.</p>
<p>German Daily Encourages Nationals</p>
<p>Although the German Consulate General did not issue a formal statement, the German Daily in Shanghai published an editorial on the front page, urging German nationals to maintain a calm and dignified attitude, and to abide by discipline. The newspaper firmly stated that it is the duty of all citizens of this international city to reduce the burden on the shoulders of the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors. The newspaper published a special four-page edition containing news of the declaration of war and announcements. The incident of British soldiers attacking the German Tennis Association at the racecourse on Sunday has been investigated by the British military authorities. It is reported that at least two British soldiers have been arrested on the spot by the British military police.</p>
<p>1,500 Germans in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that, according to the German Consulate General in Shanghai, there are currently 1,500 Germans residing in Shanghai, mostly in the French Concession. There are approximately 40 German commercial firms in the city. According to important German merchants, they are currently proceeding with work as usual, but they are concerned about the lack of transportation convenience, as German ships have been ordered not to sail to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Sino-German Friendship Improving</p>
<p>They do not intend to leave Shanghai to facilitate the purchase of raw materials such as tin and tungsten, which China produces in abundance. Major German merchants criticized the attitude of the Chinese towards the Nazi government, saying that Sino-German relations have improved since the signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact. A German national claimed, "We have regained a portion of the friendship and goodwill of the Chinese people."</p>
<p>German Leader Resumes Activities</p>
<p>Mr. Glade, Chairman of the German Association in Shanghai, whose departure from Shanghai on the British liner "Da Mei" was undecided, has recently returned here, representing German nationals and resuming his activities. Mr. Glade published a notice in the Shanghai German Daily this morning (the 5th), stating that every German national, in this critical period, must fully understand the necessity of maintaining dignity and discipline, and that the obligation to maintain peace and quiet should not be hindered by provocations and planned news.</p>
<p>Goods Moved Out of British Warehouses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that several large German commercial firms in Shanghai were busy this morning (the 5th) moving their goods out of warehouses owned by British nationals and transferring them to warehouses operated by third-country nationals, mostly American and Chinese merchants. However, apart from this, most German commercial firms in the Public Concession remain open for business today. The Deutsch-Asiatische Bank on the corner of Jiujiang Road and Sichuan Road was crowded with people all morning, mostly depositors, except for a few foreign merchants.</p>
<p>German Nationals Can Reside Freely</p>
<p>It is reported that the Public Concession authorities intend to allow German nationals to reside freely. According to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese director, this decision is different from that of 1914. At that time, Britain and France took severe actions against Germany. In this war, although Britain and France have declared war on Germany, it was out of necessity, and all measures to deal with the situation are tending towards peace. Therefore, if German nationals in Shanghai do not engage in any improper behavior, the Concession authorities will naturally allow them to live and work in peace within the Concession.</p>
<p>Italian Nationals Complete Registration</p>
<p>Since the European war situation has become increasingly acute, although Italy has expressed its intention not to participate in the war for the time being, the actions of Italy in the future are still being closely watched. The fact that the Italian mail ship "Ru Lian Gai Sa" has remained at the Degu Pier in Shanghai is noteworthy. Yesterday, according to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency, the Italian Embassy in Shanghai had completed the registration procedures for Italian nationals, as instructed by the Italian Ambassador. There are more than 1,000 Italian nationals residing in Shanghai, more than 1,000 in Tianjin, and approximately the same number in Hong Kong (including merchants and priests). Italian Ambassador Mr. Tiliangmin went to Beidaihe for summer vacation early on and will return to Shanghai in February. Consul General Mr. Celoni is also on vacation in Dalian and will return to Shanghai on the 12th or 13th of this month. The Vice Consul in charge of Italian nationals and senior officials of the embassies and consulates have all gone to Japan for summer vacation and will also return to Shanghai on the 10th of this month. The only Italian warship in Shanghai is the "Ka Luotuo", with only about 200 soldiers. The other ship, named "Ge Luoni", has sailed to Qinhuangdao. It is unknown whether it will come to Shanghai. Recently, the embassies and consulates have not only taken no action, but their telegrams are also very few.</p>
<h3>British Official Issues Notice, Severing Trade with Germany</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the British Embassy in China issued a notice yesterday afternoon, warning British people that from the outbreak of the war, it is illegal to have commercial or other connections with the enemy without official permission. Such permission will not be granted except in special circumstances, and violators will be severely punished.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that an official from the British Embassy told reporters today (the 4th) that, regarding the new regulations prohibiting British people from trading with the enemy, German, Austrian, and Jewish refugees in Shanghai are also considered "enemies". However, the regulations promulgated yesterday (the 4th) are preliminary warnings, and there are provisions that trading with certain "enemy" people may be considered "innocent".</p>
<p>The notice contains six items:</p>
<p>(1) Traders and shipowners must not trade with the enemy without official permission after the outbreak of the war. Violators will be severely punished.

Absolutely prohibited from supplying goods beneficial to the enemy, and from extracting goods imported from the enemy country. (4) Matters for merchants trading after the war: The occurrence of debts related to trade with enemy merchants before the war, and this trade is a large part of a commercial firm in a certain country, and the main trade affairs are related to exchange business in neutral territory and debt relations with the enemy country, and the debts are paid under the name of individuals, unless permitted by the British Ambassador. (5) Payments for life insurance trademarks and designs require a permit. (6) All those who trade with hostile people must consult the British Embassy.</p>
<h3>British Commercial Banks Suspend Payment of Deposits and Drafts to Germans</h3>
<p>After the British Consul General in Shanghai notified British merchants not to engage in commercial relations with enemy countries (Germany), it is reported that British banks such as HSBC, Macquarie, Great Britain, Advantage, and Sassoon have suspended the settlement of all transactions with German merchants, including deposits and drafts, from today. It is also reported that the deposits of German merchants in British banks are not large, as most of the funds of German firms and individuals are deposited in the German Deutsch-Asiatische Bank. It is also reported that German firms such as De Fu, Qian Xin, Bayer, Meister, and Mi Ye have refused to accept the notes issued to them by Chinese commercial firms from British banks.</p>
<h3>British Ships Ordered to Resume Sailing: Mail Ships to be Equipped with Small Cannons</h3>
<p>After the War: Permission Granted for Departure</p>
<p>The Japanese Empress, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 3rd (three days ago), and the Asian Empress, which arrived in Shanghai from Vancouver on the 4th, were ordered by the British Navy to be prohibited from leaving when they were about to weigh anchor, and their voyages were suspended. According to the company yesterday, they have obtained permission from the British Navy and were scheduled to weigh anchor at 11 o'clock last night. The Japanese Empress is returning to Canada, and the Asian Empress is still scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and Luzon as originally planned. According to the Continental Daily News, the Asian Empress of the China Navigation Company will sail to Vancouver after receiving instructions from the British Admiralty. Company personnel believe that after the Asian Empress arrives in Vancouver, small cannons will be installed on the deck, similar to the Russian Empress, which is currently sailing to Canada. However, they believe that the newest Japanese Empress, which left Shanghai yesterday, will be armed before the slightly older Russian Empress. The Italian ship Giulio Cesare is still berthed at the Texaco Wharf awaiting orders.</p>
<p>Taikoo Ships Resuming Service One After Another</p>
<p>The Shun Tian of the British Taikoo Company's Northern Ports route, originally scheduled to depart on the 4th, and the Qiongzhou, which was scheduled to sail to Xiamen and Hong Kong yesterday, were both ordered to suspend sailing by the British Navy. Yesterday, permission was obtained from the British military authorities, and the Shun Tian was allowed to sail to Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin this morning. The Qiongzhou is still sailing to Xiamen, Hong Kong, Guangzhouwan, Haikou, and Beihai as originally scheduled. The Wu Lin, which sails the Beisha route in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, was ordered to return to Shanghai after leaving port the day before yesterday and is also scheduled to resume service this morning.</p>
<p>Ewo and Other Ships Allowed to Leave Port</p>
<p>The Ewo, Ze Sheng, and Fu Sheng of Jardine Matheson, which were docked in Shanghai, have also been granted permission to leave port. Therefore, the Ewo left port at 6 p.m. yesterday, sailing to Hong Kong and Haiphong. The Ze Sheng is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong empty this morning, and the Fu Sheng is scheduled to sail to Qingdao and Yantai at 3 p.m. today, not going to Tianjin. The Yu Sheng of the same company is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong this afternoon, and the De Sheng is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the Northern Ports on the 8th and sail to Hong Kong on the 9th. Whether these two ships will arrive in Shanghai and leave port on schedule cannot be predicted at present.</p>
<p>Anqing Was Not Shot At</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, it was widely rumored in the city that the Anqing, a Taikoo Company ship of over 3,100 tons sailing the Luzon route, had been shot at by a submarine of a certain country. The company denied this and announced that the ship had telegraphed its Hong Kong headquarters to report its safety, in order to dispel the rumors. However, all the ships of Jardine Matheson and Taikoo in Shanghai have painted over the British flags and the large characters "British Merchant Ship" on both sides of their hulls with black paint.</p>
<p>American Ships Added to Shanghai-Europe Route</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war in Europe, the number of British and French ships in the Far East will obviously decrease. It is now known that the American President Lines will send ships to sail between Shanghai and Europe. Previously, the company only had ships sailing on the Pacific route stopping in Shanghai, while the European route only went to Hong Kong and did not come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>German Ships Cease Operations: Whereabouts of Mail Ships Unknown</h3>
<p>German Ships' Whereabouts Cause Much Speculation</p>
<p>The English-language China Press reports that the whereabouts of the three fast ships of the North German Lloyd, the Scharnhorst, the Gneisenau, and the Potsdam, which regularly sail to Shanghai, are a matter of much speculation in the city. It is said that the Scharnhorst was docked in Kobe two days ago, but it is generally believed that the ship has now left that place. The Potsdam did not sail to Bombay as originally planned and is now either in the Indian Ocean or sailing to the coast of South Africa. Among the passengers on board are three people from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, including Deputy Superintendent Kurot. The Gneisenau may be in German territorial waters.</p>
<p>Relying on the End: Extremely Busy</p>
<p>The German shipping company H. M. H. &amp; Co. and the North German Lloyd, managed by Melchers &amp; Co., have announced the suspension of their operations and are handling the winding up. The Scharnhorst of the North German Lloyd previously stopped in Kobe, Japan. Yesterday's news from Japan stated that the ship suddenly left Japan, and its whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the German shipping companies in Shanghai were busy yesterday (the 4th) making final preparations for the winding up of their operations. After the North German Lloyd closed its doors at night, the lights were brightly lit, and the Rickmers Line's Rickmers was docked at Wusong.</p>
<p>Yangtze River German Ships Barely Operating</p>
<p>Other small German ships sailing on the Yangtze River are still barely operating on various banks of the Yangtze River and are said to be safe and sound, without being antagonized or detained by the British and French navies. The Moufu, Hanna, and Haifu, three ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, are currently temporarily stranded at Qiliyu, outside Zhenhai. In addition, there are six ships of the German Rickmers Line that have been diverted to Dalian, and there are still six ships docked along the coast of that country.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Europe Postal Service Unimpeded: Post Office Specifies Routes</h3>
<p>After the expansion of the war in Europe, whether the mail delivery routes between Shanghai and Europe will be changed and whether there will be any obstacles are of particular concern to the outside world. The following is a summary of the situation:</p>
<p>Post Office Maintains Shanghai-Europe Postal Service</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu Guanqi, head of the Joint Postal Dispatch Group of the Shanghai Postal Administration, no matter how the war in Europe develops, the post office will do its utmost to maintain postal delivery to Europe and will not allow any obstruction.</p>
<p>Continue to Ship via Three Routes</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of delivery routes between Shanghai and Europe, under normal circumstances, mail is dispatched via three routes: Siberia, the Suez Canal, and the Pacific Ocean. Among them, the Siberian route is the fastest. Therefore, mail for which the sender has not specified a delivery route is transported via this route.</p>
<p>Siberian Delivery Unimpeded</p>
<p>Currently, mail on this route is still being delivered as usual. However, in the past, mail sent from Shanghai to Europe via this route was transferred through Poland after arriving in Moscow. Now that war has broken out in Poland, it may be necessary to transfer it through another route. However, there is still no obstruction to postal delivery on this route.</p>
<p>Suez Canal: Currently Loading on Japanese Ships</p>
<p>As for the Suez Canal route, after the mail ships of various countries such as Britain, France, and Italy temporarily suspended service, only Japanese mail ships are still sailing as usual. Yesterday, a batch of European mail was loaded onto the Japanese mail ship Hakozaki Maru. In the future, there may be fewer ships on this route, but postal delivery will definitely be unimpeded.</p>
<p>Pacific: Loading on American and Japanese Ships</p>
<p>On the Pacific route, the American President Lines has ships that regularly sail, and there may be more ships in the future. There are also many Japanese merchant ships sailing on this route, so it is even more accessible. However, mail sent to Europe via this route must be transferred to another ship to Europe after arriving in New York, which takes a little longer.</p>
<p>European Mail Posting Regulations</p>
<p>Foreign residents in China are very concerned about the safety of their home countries. Therefore, the post office has been extremely crowded with international letters in recent days. However, due to the tension in Europe, international postal delivery is not without difficulties. According to the post office, in order to maintain public mail, even if transportation is obstructed, it will do its best to dredge it. The following is a summary of the postal delivery methods for ordinary, registered, and express mail to various European and Asian countries. All mail sent to Australia, New Zealand, Indochina, Siam, Myanmar, the Dutch East Indies, Egypt, Pacific Islands, Singapore, Malaya, Ceylon, Africa, Britain, and other European countries via the Suez Canal will be transported by the Hakozaki Maru (September 4, 16:00), Hestederkek, Somalia, and Asian Empress. Although remittances are still normal, the number of people opening drafts has decreased.</p>

<h3>European Goods Supply Interrupted: Vigorously Promote Domestic Goods: Domestic Factories Manufacture European Goods Substitutes: Foreign Exchange Stabilizes, Gold Market Rebounds Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the war in Europe, merchant ships from Britain, France, Germany, and other countries sailing in the Far East completely suspended service, resulting in the interruption of the supply of European goods. British, French, and German foreign firms in Shanghai have been forced to announce the cancellation of previously signed orders, and sales are limited to Shanghai's existing inventory. For example, industries such as raw materials, hardware, woolens, piece goods, and industrial raw materials are all taking a wait-and-see attitude. Those who hold goods are unwilling to sell them, resulting in soaring prices and chaotic transactions. Chinese merchants, in general, have learned from the profit situation during past European wars and have bought and hoarded goods on the market in an attempt to profit, resulting in today's abnormal situation in the foreign goods market.</p>
<p>Trade with the United States and Soviet Union Not Affected</p>
<p>Regarding the export of native products, except for neutral countries such as the United States and the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Germany, and other countries have all stopped shipping, resulting in textiles, fibers, animal and animal products, raw leather, tanned leather, leather goods, medicinal materials, and spices, which were mainly sold to Britain, France, Germany, and other countries, have suffered a great impact. Domestic prices have therefore fallen sharply. In the case of Chinese silk, the price has fallen by more than 1,000 yuan per picul. At the same time, the easing of the black market foreign exchange rate has caused the prices of native products to fall. Fortunately, the main native products sold to the United States and the Soviet Union, such as tea, minerals, bristles, and tung oil, have not been significantly affected. The Trade Commission is now doing its utmost to dredge exports.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Groups: Promotion Opportunities</p>
<p>Various domestic goods groups believe that the high prices of European goods and the interruption of supply are an opportunity to vigorously promote domestic sales, so they hope that the Chinese people will replace imported goods with domestic products, directly reversing the impact of the sluggish sales of native products, and indirectly reducing the overall import surplus, so that China's international balance of payments can be balanced. Recently, the number of domestically produced goods manufactured in Shanghai and imported into the mainland has increased compared to before. This situation is actually beneficial to China's war of resistance. At the same time, there are also some domestic goods factories that are imitating foreign goods to manufacture substitutes. It is said that the quality of these domestically produced goods that replace imported goods is not inferior to that of foreign goods.</p>
<p>Trade between Britain, France, Germany, and Poland and China</p>
<p>Trade between Britain, France, Germany, and Poland and China has almost come to a standstill due to the impact of the war. The voyages of the four countries in the Far East have been interrupted, so trade with China will inevitably be greatly affected from September. The following is a record of trade from January to July: (1) Britain imported 44,689,000 yuan and exported 44,413,300 yuan; (2) France imported 6,538,000 yuan and exported 17,962,000 yuan; (3) Germany imported 59,010,100 yuan and exported 35,600,700 yuan; (4) Poland imported 3,173,000 yuan and exported 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Black Market Exchange Rate Slightly Stabilizes</p>
<p>After the Shanghai black market foreign exchange rate eased due to the European war, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation quoted the same price as the day before yesterday, with no change. The actual market exchange rate was 4 pence 6875 for British exchange and 8 yuan 0625 for American exchange. The exchange rate has stabilized slightly. Regarding foreign currency transactions, there are still no transactions in German gold notes, French francs, or Italian lire. The Money Exchange Association announced the market buying and selling prices for the industry this morning: British gold pounds buy 70 yuan and sell 74 yuan, British gold notes buy 43 yuan and sell 45 yuan, American gold pounds buy 73 yuan and sell 77 yuan, American gold notes buy 11 yuan 8 jiao and sell 12 yuan, and Hong Kong notes buy 2 yuan 6 jiao and sell 2 yuan 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Securities Gray Market: Legal Tender Rises</p>
<p>After the securities gray market opened this morning, the value of legal tender increased due to the stability of the market and the increased legal tender value, and the unified bonds rose slightly in the morning and fell slightly in the afternoon. The closing prices are as follows: Type A was 51 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen in the morning and 51 yuan 1 jiao in the afternoon, Type B was 45 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen in the morning and 45 yuan in the afternoon, Type C was 43 yuan 7 jiao in the morning and 43 yuan 4 jiao in the afternoon, there were no transactions in Type D in the morning or afternoon, and Type E was 43 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen in the morning and 43 yuan 2 jiao in the afternoon. As for the value of Chinese legal tender, its value has increased compared to before due to the easing of the black market foreign exchange rate, but the legal price of the Central Bank remains stable as ever.</p>
<p>Gold Rebounds: Swap Points Fall</p>
<p>After the gold gray market opened this morning, rumors abounded in the market, the situation was chaotic, and speculators prevailed, resulting in large fluctuations in prices. The morning closing price was 3,500 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 3,480 yuan, an increase of more than 400 yuan compared to the day before. The initial quotation for silver bullion was 315 yuan, which was later changed to 345 yuan. As for the swap points, the swap point prices fell sharply due to the market being oversupplied. Yesterday, it was about 125 yuan. However, this swap point has already been ordered to be banned by the Ministry of Finance, and it may be eliminated in the future. Moreover, those who operate this swap point are general small money shops.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise and Fall: Active Ordering of Foreign Rice, Hoarders Dare Not Import Too Much: First Batch of Tribute Rice for Price Stabilization Prepared for Customs Clearance and Import</h3>
<p>Previously, the price of rice in the city was soaring, and it was difficult for the common people to maintain their livelihoods. Yu Qiaqing and others, in order to maintain the people's food supply, jointly telegraphed the central government and obtained 10,000 pounds of foreign exchange from Finance Minister Kong to order tribute rice for price stabilization. It is said that the first batch of more than 1,800 tons, equivalent to 18,319 bags, has been loaded onto the Norwegian merchant Haida, operated by Wah Lun Shipping Company, and is being transported here. It is currently en route and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 8th or 9th. It has already been reported to the Jianghai Customs. At that time, the price of rice is expected to fall. Yesterday, the amount of rice that arrived in the market under the river was two ships, a total of 530 piculs. In addition, there were more than 1,000 piculs transported to Shanghai by land train. Merchants listed 4,242 bags, all of which were indica rice. The price of rice in the early market had continued to rise by about 2 yuan, but the price in the evening market fell by 4 yuan, averaging a drop of about 2 yuan compared to the day before. There was not much fluctuation in other goods. The reason is that the amount of arrivals is increasing, the appetite of rice shops is limited, and the foreign rice ordered is transported by the Norwegian merchant Haida, which is not affected by the war in Europe, and various industries are still very active in ordering, so hoarders in general dare not import too much.</p>
<h3>US Marine Corps Return to Shanghai from Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>Shortened Summer Training Period for H Company, USS Chaumont Scheduled to Return to the United States Expeditiously</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the USS Chaumont, carrying 176 US Marine Corps soldiers and 30-40 American expatriates who left Tianjin to avoid the floods, arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 p.m. yesterday (the 4th). The American soldiers are from D Company of the 4th Marine Regiment and have been engaged in summer training at the Holcomb Camp in Qinhuangdao for six weeks. The American expatriates who were evacuated are the families of US Navy and Marine Corps officers stationed in Tianjin, mostly women and children. Although some of them regretted leaving their husbands stationed in Tianjin, most of them were indeed very happy to leave the horror of the floods. The USS Chaumont will not</p>
<p>Sail Upstream</p>
<p>The US Navy pontoon is docked at buoys 12 and 13 downstream. The US Marine Corps soldiers and passengers were transported to the Customs Wharf by a tugboat, where they disembarked. The soldiers were then transported to the Xiaoshapu Road Barracks by a convoy of trucks. The USS Chaumont will be docked in Shanghai for eight days and will return to the United States on the 12th of this month via Manila, Guam, and Honolulu. According to reports, the USS Chaumont was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on August 31. However, due to the Tianjin floods,</p>
<p>The Situation Deteriorated</p>
<p>US Asia Fleet Commander Admiral Hart ordered the transport ship to be stationed on the North China Sea in order to evacuate American expatriates avoiding the Tianjin floods. The ship also repeatedly transported supplies from Qinhuangdao to Tanggu to supply the US Marine Corps in Tianjin, which was in the floods, because railway traffic had been cut off. In addition, H Company of the US 4th Marine Regiment, which left on the USS Chaumont for Holcomb Camp in Qinhuangdao on August 23, has been ordered by the commander</p>
<p>To Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Due to the outbreak of the war in Europe, it was decided to shorten the training period of H Company in North China and return to Shanghai immediately. The USS Marblehead has been dispatched to Qinhuangdao to transport the soldiers back to Shanghai and is scheduled to arrive here today (the 5th).</p>
<h3>Wu Zhiqian's Corpse Prepared for Burial, Position as President of Women's University and Primary and Secondary Schools to Be Succeeded by His Younger Brother Yizhi</h3>
<p>Wu Zhiqian, president of the private Shanghai Women's University (and primary and secondary schools) and a native of Tongzhou, was fatally shot in the school the day before yesterday. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the police requested the Special First Court to send a prosecutor and a forensic examiner to the scene to examine Wu's body. The examination revealed that Wu Zhiqian had indeed died from being shot. The body was claimed by the deceased's family member, Wu's younger brother Yizhi, and sent to the Wan Guo Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road. Wu's father, Jueyu (who is 70 years old), and his lifelong friends, together with more than 50 faculty and staff members from the university and primary and secondary schools, held a grand funeral at 2 p.m. They plan to temporarily place the coffin in the funeral parlor and hold the funeral at a later date when the situation is stable, choose a day to send out invitations, and transport the coffin back to Tongzhou for burial. In addition, there is a seven-year-old son named Luoming (who was born while studying at the University of Rome in Italy; Wu's wife is deceased) who is currently studying in the countryside of Tongzhou. As for the aftermath of school affairs, it is said that when Wu Zhiqian was injured and sent to the hospital for treatment in an ambulance, Wu personally instructed his younger brother Wu Yizhi (currently the director of general affairs of the school and a graduate of Meiji University), who accompanied him to the hospital, in the ambulance, saying that if he was seriously injured and in danger of death, Yizhi should succeed him as the president of Shanghai Women's University and primary and secondary schools.</p>
<h3>Three-Fen Tram Tokens: Counterfeit Tokens Discovered, Company Sets Deadline to Collect Genuine Tokens, Public Buses Increase Fares Today</h3>
<p>Since the market refused to accept postage stamps, various businesses issued tokens for circulation due to a lack of small change, and unscrupulous people took the opportunity to counterfeit them, resulting in counterfeit tokens being rampant. Recently, someone even counterfeited the tokens of the Shanghai Municipal Council Tramways Company and mixed them in the market. Therefore, the company specifically issued a notice on each tram, "Important Notice to Passengers Regarding Cash Tokens: Counterfeit three-fen value tokens have been found to be mixed in the market. For the benefit of passengers themselves, please do not accept the company's tokens from exchange shops or any stores. The company's tokens should only be</p>
<p>Received from Ticket Sellers</p>
<p>on the company's vehicles." At the same time, the effective date of these limited-time tokens was also specified. The notice stated, "In order to prevent counterfeiting, all of the company's three-fen tokens with the dates of June 1939, July 1939, and August 1939 must be used on the company's vehicles before September 20, 1939. The company will not accept any three-fen tokens with the above dates after September 20, 1939. This notice." Furthermore, the British-owned China</p>
<p>General Omnibus</p>
<p>Company has submitted a request to the Municipal Council to appropriately increase passenger fares. In addition to monthly tickets, which have already increased in price since the 1st, ordinary passenger tickets will also be increased starting today. The newly revised detailed price list for each route and money station has already been printed by the company and posted in each bus compartment. Subsequently, the ticket price will increase by about two fen compared to before. Due to the lack of one-fen auxiliary coins, all odd-numbered fares have been changed to even numbers, so the lowest value has also increased to four fen.</p>
<h3>Second Examination of Exchange Drawing</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the new exchange drawing system in the silver and money industry, each bank and shop provided collateral and obtained interbank exchange drawing from the Bank United Preparation Committee. As of the end of July, the amount used was 14,751,100 yuan. Now, the Exchange Drawing Preparation Inspection Committee has implemented the second examination in accordance with the inspection rules (from August 1 to August 31). Chairman Xu Jilun, together with accountant Pan Xulun, examined the collateral and total amount of interbank exchange drawing used by all banks and money shops. Once the examination is completed, a public announcement will be made to show great credibility. (Also, yesterday's report on the number of exchange drawing used from August 20 to August 26 was not true. The number was actually the number of exchange drawing notes exchanged by the silver and money industry from August 13 to August 19, not the amount of interbank exchange drawing used by each bank and shop. We hereby make a correction.)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Assassination Case: Four Chinese Not Extradited: Reports from Tianjin that They Have Been Handed Over Are Not Accurate, British Court Date Set</h3>
<p>Regarding the four Chinese suspects detained in the Tianjin British Concession in the case of the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, the Arnhold &amp; Company law firm in Shanghai, entrusted by the Pitman &amp; Holford law firm in London, applied to the British Supreme Court in Shanghai for habeas corpus. On August 30, a telegram from Tianjin reported that the British Concession authorities had decided to hand over the four suspects to the Japanese side on the 31st. The British court judge immediately sent a telegram to Tianjin at 4 p.m. on the 31st, requesting the British Concession authorities to announce the evidence against the four suspects, indicating that the court was accepting the case. Whether the four had been handed over or not, the British judge's telegram was sent too late, and was a matter of concern to both Chinese and foreigners. A telegram from Tianjin yesterday reported that the four had been handed over, and all circles felt that there was no hope for the case. Subsequently, reliable news from the Arnhold &amp; Company law firm confirmed that the four had not been handed over, and the reports from the outside were purely false. The date for the trial of this case has been set for September 11 (next Monday). At that time, Sir Moseley, the chief justice of the British Supreme Court, will have returned to Shanghai and will conduct the trial.</p>
<h3>Employees of American Enterprises Company Collude to Embezzle Medicines, Secretly Transporting and Selling for Profit, Three Arrested Together After Case Exposed</h3>
<p>Lu Jingfang, a native of Ningbo, was an inspector at the American Enterprises Company at 7 Xinanhe Temple Road in Shanghai. In February of this year, Lu suddenly had a malicious idea and intended to secretly transport the company's products out. He secretly discussed this with Zhang Zhiruan, also a native of Ningbo and an employee of the company, and colluded with Zhou Zhongyi, a doctor of Western medicine from Songjiang who resided at 46 Huacheng Road in the French Concession, to</p>
<p>Take Charge of Sales</p>
<p>of the stolen goods and transportation. After the agreement was reached, Lu, Zhang, and others first stole blank order forms from a certain pharmacy that had a relationship with the company, filled them out with goods, and successively transported out vanillin, cod liver oil, and Cresyl oil worth 7,446 yuan and 5 jiao 1 fen. Zhou Zhongyi prepared a truck to transport the goods and stored them in the Qiangzhongxing in the Xin Shou An Lane on Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession, and successively sold them for profit. However, in June, Zhang Zhiruan was suddenly dismissed from the company. Until recently, Zhang suddenly</p>
<p>Had a Change of Heart</p>
<p>and reported the facts of the past to the company authorities. Chen Xiaomei, a representative of the American Enterprises Company, reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanjing and Detective Zhang Yunjian to arrest Lu Jingfang, Zhang Zhiruan, and Zhou Zhongyi and detain them in the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Chen Tingrui, a lawyer hired by the American Enterprises Company, filed a civil suit in court, and Wang Yaotang, a lawyer for the police station,</p>
<p>Stated the Case</p>
<p>and prosecuted Lu and Zhang for embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Code, and prosecuted Zhou Zhongyi for selling stolen goods. He also stated that the defendants had confessed everything in the police station, that Zhang and Lu each received 1,000 yuan, and that Zhou Zhongyi pocketed the rest. The case still needs to be investigated, and a request was made to change the date. After questioning by the judge, the defendants were ordered to be detained and the date was changed for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Cholera Epidemic: Increasingly Rampant: Twenty-One People in Three Days</h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been abnormal, with sudden cold and heat, causing epidemics to spread, with extremely rampant momentum.

<h3>Public Bus: Girl Crushed to Death</h3>
<p>Yu Feng, a native of Ningbo, who lived at 13 Bing'an Lane, Aiduya Road, 45 years old, took his seven-year-old daughter, Guiying, from No. 71 Kaiziyier Road at 3 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, crossing the road from north to south. Yu was walking in front, and the girl was following behind. When they reached the middle of the road, a F830 public bus, driven by the driver of the French Shang 21st Road Public Bus Company No. 324, was coming from east to west, and the bus could not brake to avoid them, causing the girl to be knocked down and her head and right leg injured. The patrolmen arrived, recorded the license plate number, and sent the girl to the Guangci Hospital, and then reported to the police station. However, Yu's daughter died of her injuries at 5 p.m. that afternoon.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Aiduya Road</h3>

<h3>Counterfeiting of Vouchers Leads to Charges of Forgery</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of small currency in Shanghai, businesses commonly issue vouchers for small change transactions to facilitate exchanges. However, some unscrupulous individuals are taking advantage of the situation by engaging in widespread counterfeiting, causing confusion and severely impacting society. The Da Yu Shun Sauce Garden at 134 Rue Cardinal Foch also issues such vouchers. Unexpectedly, two men from Danyang, Wu Zhongxiao and Zhao Guanghui, secretly approached the Da Zhong Guo Printing House at 739 Rue Niu Zhuang and requested them to</p>
<p>Duplicate the Vouchers</p>
<p>They printed 2,500 vouchers for the sauce garden, each with a face value of two cents, and bearing a chop, and attempted to use them fraudulently at shops along Rue Cardinal Foch. On the afternoon of the 4th, Wu Zhongxiao again used counterfeit vouchers to purchase goods at a cigarette and paper shop at 147 Rue Cardinal Foch. At the time, Shen Xinguang, a clerk from Da Yu Shun Sauce Garden, was also in the shop. He apprehended Wu Zhongxiao and confirmed that the vouchers being used were indeed counterfeit. He then reported the matter to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched Detective Wang Siming, who arrested Wu, along with 45 counterfeit vouchers found on his person, and</p>
<p>Took him to the Police Station.</p>
<p>Under interrogation, Wu confessed that he and Zhao Guanghui had jointly counterfeited a total of 2,500 vouchers, of which he had obtained 250, and had already spent over 200 of them. The remaining 2,250 vouchers, along with the chop, were taken away by Zhao, he said. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Wu to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit according to the law, requesting severe punishment. After the judge questioned Wu clearly, he was remanded in custody pending sentencing on a later date. Furthermore,</p>
<p>The He Ji Food Company</p>
<p>At 1921 Jing An Temple Road, recently started to print their own one-cent and two-cent vouchers for change due to the unavailability of stamps. However, they discovered that similar counterfeit vouchers were being used to purchase goods at their company. The manager, Hua Junwei, was informed that these counterfeit vouchers were printed by the Hai Ning Printing House at 1008 Hai Ning Road. He reported this to the relevant police station of the Huisi precinct. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched</p>
<p>Secretly to the Address</p>
<p>They arrested Qiu Xigen (25 years old) from Qingpu, the owner of the printing house, and seized 24,000 printed one-cent and two-cent He Ji Company vouchers. He confessed that the vouchers were printed on the recommendation of his friend Peng Ruixiang from Haimen, who worked at the Huizhong Printing House at 7 Xiafei Road in the French Concession. The detectives then went to the Huizhong Printing House in the French Concession,</p>
<p>And apprehended Peng.</p>
<p>Both were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the case and charged them with forgery, requesting an extension to present the counterfeit vouchers for inspection and to question the two defendants. Their statements were evasive. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them remanded in custody for further verification at a later date.</p>
<h3>Worker Wu San Tragically Stabbed to Death</h3>
<p>Wu San, 41 years old, from Dongtai, and Zhu Jiuru, from Rugao, are both laborers working for Lu Lianfu's truck company on Xinkaihe Road. Three days ago, Wu San set up a makeshift bed in the loft of the Wanfu Chang Clothing Store at 50 Xiangshun Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession. Suddenly, at around 9 PM last night, Zhu Jiuru gathered a group of thugs and stormed into the loft where Wu was staying. In a threatening manner, they forced Wu to go outside to talk. Wu refused to go out. Seeing that something was amiss, Tai, a clothing apprentice from the second landlord, and Zhou Guangzhao, rushed to the entrance of the lane to call the Chinese police on duty. However, before the police arrived, Zhu ordered the thugs to stab Wu twice in the chest. As they were about to flee, they were intercepted by the patrol police guarding the lane. A sharp weapon used in the attack was seized. They were taken to the police station. Unfortunately, Wu's injuries were critical. He collapsed at the entrance of the Fuyuan Sauce Garden at the intersection of Kangti Road. The police hired a rickshaw to take him to the police station. They were about to transfer him to the hospital, but he died due to his severe injuries. The suspect is temporarily detained in the police station, awaiting transfer to the Second Special District Court for punishment. The motive for the attack is said to have stemmed from a work-related feud.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Great Shanghai Printing House Go on Hunger Strike</h3>
<p>Demands for Pay Raise Unmet, Bosses Stop Meals</p>
<p>Seventy workers at the Great Shanghai Printing House at Mayers and Bubbling Well Roads, Public Concession, recently requested a salary increase from the owners to maintain their livelihoods. The owners refused and stopped providing meals. Seeing the owners' increasingly harsh actions, all the workers began a hunger strike on the 3rd, and the situation remains deadlocked.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Busted on Peng Road</h3>
<p>Cantonese men Mai Jiu, Liu Zhi, and others were running a gambling den at 15, Alley 572, Peng Road, using dice as the gambling tool. Detectives from the Hongkou Police Station learned of this and rushed to the scene, arresting the two bosses, Mai and Liu, and 24 gamblers, including He Genji, along with the gambling equipment. Yesterday morning, they were taken to the First Special District Court, where Judge Dai questioned them and found the charges to be true. They were sentenced to imprisonment and fines, and the gambling equipment was confiscated as a warning.</p>
<h3>Editor Co-habits with Female Proofreader, Wife Reports Adultery</h3>
<p>Wife Initially Agreed, Then Changes Her Mind, Court Orders Postponement to Summon Witnesses for Further Verification</p>
<p>Author Chu Yi, 35 years old, originally from Yi, has authored works such as "Eight Hundred Famous Ancient and Modern Essays," "Student's Small Vocabulary," "Model Essay Dictionary," and "One Hundred Volumes of Children's Common Knowledge Series." He currently edits the Composition Self-Study Magazine and runs the Oriental Bookstore at 134 Avenue Edward VII. Chu previously married Feng Wanfang, a woman from Jin, through a matchmaker named Feng Chengfu. After the marriage, Feng disdained Chu's poor financial situation and</p>
<p>Looked Down on Her In-laws. At the time, Chu was still studying. Chu's father died of anger due to family turmoil. After Chu graduated, Feng demanded to live separately. Later, through the mediation of the matchmaker Feng Chengfu, the couple separated. Feng's living expenses were paid by Chu on a monthly basis. Feng allowed Chu to remarry. In 1933, Chu joined the Beixin Bookstore as an editor. Later, he fell in love with Yao Yunying, a female proofreader from Yuyao at the World Bookstore (31 years old), due to their friendship. They co-edited the "National Studies Outline," which deepened their</p>
<p>Love. In March 1934, Chu fell ill and failed to send living expenses to Feng. Feng's father sent a letter to Chu on behalf of his daughter, stating, "Unless you break away from Yao Yunying, the living expenses cannot be interrupted." In October of the same year, Feng came to Shanghai for direct negotiations, voluntarily agreeing not to cohabit with Chu in Shanghai again. Chu would provide her with 20 yuan per month for living expenses, and she allowed Chu to cohabit with Yao Yunying. Therefore, on October 11 of the same year, a contract was signed by lawyer Xu Yuxiang, and Chu began cohabiting with Yao Yunying. In April 1935, Feng came to Shanghai with her father and aunt and visited the</p>
<p>Co-habitation Place of Chu and Yao</p>
<p>In Jingde Lane, Baoshan Road, without any objections. In June of this year, Chu invited Feng to Shanghai to escape the unrest in his hometown, with all expenses borne by Chu. On July 14, Chu suffered from an epidemic, and Feng also visited Chu and Yao at their cohabitation place. Later, Chu returned to his hometown due to his mother's illness. Feng recently hired a lawyer to negotiate with Chu for an increase in living expenses. Although Chu returned to Shanghai, he did not pay the large sum demanded by Feng. On the night of the 17th of last month, Feng reported to the News Police Station and caught Chu and Yao in adultery at the Oriental Bookstore. After investigation, the police summoned Chu and Yao Yunying to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday</p>
<p>For prosecution according to law. Judge Meng presided over the trial. The plaintiff, Feng Wanfang, testified that she only discovered her husband's affair after coming to Shanghai, so she reported the adultery. The defendant, Chu Yi, claimed that he had obtained Feng's consent when he began cohabiting with Yao Yunying. Yao Yunying testified that when she began cohabiting with Chu in October 1934, there was not only a lawyer's testimony but also a celebratory banquet. After verifying the statements, the court ordered a postponement for further investigation and questioning.</p>
<h3>Collapsing Wall Injures Two Women</h3>
<p>Chen Guo, an old woman from Zhenjiang, 51 years old, and Wang Ding, 70 years old, both lived at 8, Lane 157, Haig Road, Western District of Shanghai. At around 8 PM yesterday, after finishing their meal, they carried bamboo stools to the courtyard to cool off and chat due to the hot weather. Unexpectedly, the brick wall there, due to being exposed to wind and rain in recent days, lost its center of gravity and suddenly collapsed. The two old women were directly in its path and were crushed by the brick wall. Bystanders managed to pull them out. Chen's left leg was already broken, and Wang's chest injuries were severe. A vehicle was urgently summoned to take them to the hospital for treatment. Wang's condition is very critical.</p>

<p>Qin A'da (23 years old), daughter of Qin, owner of the Qin Xi Tofu Shop at 31 Guanyinge Street, Xinkaihekou, Nanshi Refugee Area, returned home from Pudong the day before yesterday. In the evening, she and her sister Qin Jindi (16 years old) slept in the same room. Unexpectedly, at around 1 AM yesterday morning, two soldiers knocked on the door and entered the room, intending to commit indecency. The two women were awakened from their sleep and were greatly alarmed. Without time to choose, they jumped from the window one after the other, breaking their legs and suffering serious injuries. They were discovered and sent to the hospital for treatment by the General Office of the Refugee Area.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Shih Pao Association</h3>
<p>The Shih Pao (The China Times) has a history of more than 30 years since its founding. The employees currently working at the newspaper have been with the paper for at least ten years. Unexpectedly, the newspaper suddenly shut down on August 31st at 4 PM, sealing off various departments and suspending publication, leaving the hundreds of employees who had shared hardships for many years without proper arrangements. The employees of the newspaper formed the Shih Pao Association on the 4th (the day before yesterday) to discuss countermeasures and urge the newspaper authorities to come forward for negotiations and reach a satisfactory resolution.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the "Loss of Both Money and Wife: Newly Rich Accused of Fraud" in the local news section of your newspaper on the 4th of this month, it stated that "Fa Xing Rong Meat Shop at 2082 Haig Road, given meat to proprietor Chen Feizhang, who had also acted as the President of Ji Wang Temple 'Maintenance Committee' and so on."

<h3>European War Does Not Affect Shanghai Western Football League, Thirty-Four Teams Register to Participate, Only Six Teams Registered for the First Division</h3>
<p>The European war is something that will affect the Shanghai Western Football League this year, and it is of great concern to the local football community. According to the authorities of the Shanghai Western Football Club, this year's plan will proceed as usual unless unforeseen events occur, in which case further consideration will be given. Registration closed yesterday, with a total of thirty-four teams registered in the three divisions A, B, and C. Some teams will join in the coming days. Due to the involvement of the British army in the war, the British army team will likely not be able to participate this year, and they may have no interest in it. The navy is also difficult to determine.</p>
<p>The 1939-40 Shanghai Western Football League registration closed at 5:00 PM on the 5th (yesterday). Michael Wynn of the Western Football Club will announce the full list, saying that it must be announced three days later. It is known that there are six teams in the First Division, the same as the reserve division, eight teams in the Second Division, and fourteen teams in the Third Division, for a total of thirty-four teams, but there may be additions in the coming days.</p>
<p>Six Teams in the First Division</p>
<p>In the First Division, of last year's nine teams, the French Chamber of Commerce is still deliberating and considering due to the European situation, but it is likely to participate. The East Serlai team will soon be transferred. Their replacement team is not yet known and must wait until their arrival before registering. The Zhendan team, which finished fourth in the First Division last year, has voluntarily withdrawn to the Third Division. Other teams such as Donghua, Western Police, and Portuguese One are participating as usual. These are the six teams in the First Division.</p>
<p>Lido Issue</p>
<p>However, there are still two teams that are qualified to participate in the First Division, but they must be approved by the new executive committee elected at the annual meeting, namely Lido and North Western Boys. Lido was the champion of last year's Scott Cup and also fought the joint army team in the charity match, but winning the Scott Cup does not immediately qualify them for promotion to the First Division. However, according to predictions from relevant parties, it can be cited as an example that Donghua was selected into the First Division as a new member. North Western Boys was the runner-up in last year's Second Division, and their promotion to the First Division may be problematic. The lists of teams in each division obtained from various sources are as follows:</p>
<p>First Division (6 teams): Donghua Club, Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, Western Police Club, St. Francis, Western Firth, Lacus. To be reviewed for promotion (2 teams): Lido Club, North Western Boys. Reserve Division (same as above)</p>
<p>Second Division (8 teams): Survey, Youth, Friendship, Junior, Jewish, Russian Army, Sukel, Yaperun.</p>
<p>Third Division (14 teams): Zhendan, Peide, Park United, Russian Emigrants, Health, Tongwen, Vitells, Jovens, Rowing Club, Survey, Jewish, Holy Light, Leisure, Herzi Fort. New members to be reviewed (2 teams): Golian, Marsk.</p>

Fang Gang's lineup remained unchanged. In a fierce competition, Fang Gang took the first set with a score of 21 to 19. Fudan fought back hard and won the final two sets with scores of 20 to 16, avenging their loss to the China Youth Association. Fudan has now won all seven matches and won the First Division championship. Fang Gang's captain, Zheng Yiquan, showed good skills but lacked good attitude, insulting the referee, causing an uproar in the audience. The Holy Music Troupe defeated Zhengxin in the Second Division and won first place.</p>

<h3>Meat Market</h3>
<p>— Mang Mang</p>
<p>The fresh meat industry has already gone on strike because it is unwilling to be unreasonably controlled.</p>
<p>This is actually not a very serious social problem. Strictly speaking, pork can only be considered a luxury item, not a necessity. People can still live without pork. Moreover, the working masses have always lived without pork. Since the outbreak of the war, due to economic constraints, the group of people who do not eat pork has expanded from the proletariat to the lower middle class. This is naturally not because they do not want to eat meat, but because of their weak purchasing power.</p>
<p>Originally, in this extraordinary period, only by enduring hardship and being resilient can one have a real guarantee of one's own life, and by extension, the country and the nation will also receive a lot of help. Therefore, any form of "thrift" is worth promoting. So, going from passively (restricted by purchasing power) to actively not eating pork is not a meaningless thing.</p>
<p>The fact that pork does not have a significant relationship with society can be seen in the two strikes. Neither strike caused social unrest or panic, which cannot be compared with the turmoil when there is a shortage of rice. The reason is that pork has become the private property of the propertied class, and the propertied class has the power to replace meat with other things. Therefore, the current society, in which the lower middle class and the proletariat make up the majority, has not been disturbed by the cessation of pork.</p>
<p>However, we cannot ignore the occurrence of this problem, and we must further explore the cause and consequences of this problem.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the manipulation of pork has a political role that goes beyond commercial considerations. The direct impact of this event is not on the entire society, but on the pork merchants, and the indirect impact is on the butchers. Since the conflicting parties are so simple, those who are eager to find a solution will inevitably be the pork merchants, as described below.</p>
<p>"The fresh meat industry sent six representatives yesterday morning at 10:00 AM (two each from the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Hongkou District) to Hongkou to negotiate with the 'Livestock Market,' requesting (1) the abolition of the auction system and the restoration of the original method of weighing by the catty; (2) the reduction of selling prices to maintain the meat supply in Shanghai. Manager Songyuan of the 'Market' stated that because the current auction system is based on Japanese domestic methods, he would agree to submit a request to the 'Asia Development Board' to abolish it, and at the same time advised the meat industry to resume business immediately, and set a date for the representatives to go to the 'Asia Development Board' to request." (This newspaper)</p>
<p>In this short piece of news, the attitudes of both parties have been written very clearly. And we believe that such negotiations by the fresh meat industry will not yield results. This can be proven by "Why pork prices are soaring even though it is not an imported product" and the results of the last strike. Even if the other party makes a slight concession on the surface, no one can guarantee that the third "pork incident" will not happen again.</p>
<p>Why are pork merchants doing this? To put it plainly, in order to maintain their own interests. And the other party is trying to amass capital for a "long-term war." We only need to weigh the gains and losses slightly to feel that the path that the fresh meat industry is currently taking is not the best one.</p>
<p>Yes, the current passive resistance of the fresh meat industry is only a temporary strike, because although the strike hurts its own interests, it also undermines the other party's attempts. Perhaps, when their own interests are harmed, there will be genuine concessions. In this struggle, the employees of the fresh meat industry—the butchers—will of course suffer. Fortunately, they are strong and able to get a little help from their employers, so they will not starve to death.</p>
<p>We are not absolutely opposed to eating pork, and we sympathize with the situation and experience of the fresh meat industry: but, we are unwilling to eat pork that poisons us!</p>
<h3>Is the Wool Coming from the Sheep?</h3>
<p>— Weaker</p>
<p>In last month's issue of this publication, a subtenant wrote an article entitled "The Landlord and Second Landlord's Wishful Thinking." That kind of get-rich-quick mentality that feared no chaos in the world was almost as clear as a floodlight, allowing those of us who are subtenants to see it clearly. But what's the point of seeing it clearly? Thirty yuan for a pavilion upstairs, one hundred yuan for a regular厢 room. No families allowed, no guarantors, no rent. The amount of security deposit, the number of tips, and the variety of items were alarming! Some people used to say that "Shanghainese moving is like mice moving," but now, let alone moving, even a single man trying to find a place to shelter from the wind and rain is not an easy thing. Even if you are lucky enough to have more favorable conditions and get a head start, and then save money and try to get through this difficult time, the fishermen who fish in troubled waters will never give up every opportunity that comes their way. If there is any disturbance, not only will the wool come from the sheep, but the wool collectors will overcharge the sheep. We all rented houses after the war, and the house prices have increased dozens of times out of proportion, but when the land tax increases, the second landlord immediately divides it among the tenants. And dozens of percentages are allocated over the hundreds of percentages out of the proportion increase in the rent, and isn't this bit by bit, a small fortune? Now the electricity price has increased again. The International Settlement is 112%, and the French Concession is 60% (including the previous 15% increase). With this feather duster as an imperial decree, the second landlord is eloquent and immediately divides it among the tenants. For example, I live in the French Concession, and the rent for a front building is 35 yuan. When the land tax and water fee increased last time, it was "allocated" by 20%, which is 42 yuan at the current price. The electric light is stipulated to be 32 candle power. If you speak honestly, the second landlord should be satisfied. Even if the electricity bill now increases by 45%, the 45% of a 32 candle power light is very small, but his "allocation" method is really clever: they calculate the number of light bulbs in the entire house, and after calculation, each bulb increases by one yuan. At first glance, this method seems very fair, but what is the actual situation? Let me tell you: the subtenant's electric lights are turned on at 6:00 PM and turned off at 12:00 AM, and they are on for six hours; their electric lights are bright, and they are on all night, and there are electric fans, electric irons, etc. Under such an unequal consumption ratio, if you want to allocate according to household, isn't the saying that the wool comes from the sheep a too beautiful word!</p>
<h3>Tears Bought in the West</h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>Beechwood</p>
<p>Located below Qiongxuan,</p>
<p>A path of green reaches the door,</p>
<p>Chickens and dogs and gods in an instant,</p>
<p>Hibiscus city and Willow Grove Park.</p>
<p>The Beechwood Girls' School is of good quality and low price, but unfortunately, an oriental woman has already gotten there first. If Mao Yi had entered this school, she might have been spared the difficulty of the plague, but she couldn't, isn't that fate? The fireworks at Willow Grove Park are as beautiful as flowers, and there are hundreds of plays in many forms, which can be compared to the fairyland of Hibiscus City.</p>
<p>Clear ripples connecting the green to the sky,</p>
<p>Pavilions in the wind and cloud, colorful pens are beautiful,</p>
<p>Fragrance of clothes on the bridge, trees beyond flowers,</p>
<p>Spirits always circle around Phoenixville.</p>
<p>Gay Street in Phoenixville has pavilions in the wind and cloud, which are quiet and beautiful. Gay Street Bridge is magnificent in structure, and you can see the whole city from the bridge. In the shadow of the setting sun, young girls pass over the bridge, or stop in the courtyards of the houses in the Gay Street area, which are unique and beautiful, and Mao Yi always sketches on the bridge.</p>
<p>Adorning the window, the sound of the shadows is clear and charming,</p>
<p>Clouds and rosy clouds coming out of the sea are like brocade,</p>
<p>A unique secluded residence in a corner of the world,</p>
<p>The endless autumn colors reach the eyebrows.</p>
<p>Cape May Point faces the Atlantic Ocean, and has the beauty of morning clouds and evening rosy clouds in the long summer. Just because the female schoolmates all speak a certain Central European language, their attitude is estranged from the new students, and Mao Yi has been unhappy since then.</p>
<p>The dew is new on the eastern side of America,</p>
<p>The fragrance of fallen leaves is better than good spring,</p>
<p>It's just that there is a fate that cannot be thrown away,</p>
<p>The sky is full of sadness.</p>
<p>In October, when Mao Yi passed away, the yellow leaves were flying and the autumn colors were gorgeous.</p>
<p>The poems above all describe the scenery on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, and can be read as travel poems of the New World, to supplement the shortcomings of "Observations on a Trip to America." (The End)</p>
<h3>When You Receive a Compensation Coupon</h3>
<p>— (Gu Zhibin)</p>
<p>When you receive a compensation coupon, first, you should pay attention to the name of the store on the coupon; second, pay attention to the address of the store; third, pay attention to the printing and paper of the coupon. If the address of the issuer of the coupon is very far away, or the coupon only has the name of the store but no address, or the printed address is not clear, or the printing is blurred and causes doubt, you can refuse to accept it. Because after receiving a compensation coupon with a distant address, when you use the coupon for payment, you will either be rejected by others, or the recipient of the coupon will not directly go to the store to use it, and can only put the coupon in a high place; or the address is unknown and the coupon is fake, so it cannot be cashed or used, which is equivalent to waste paper.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: The fundamental solution is to ask each store to temporarily use postage stamps.)</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Overseas Gossip Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaves; The Scenery in the Fire Shines like a Lotus Flower</p>
<p>Originally, the He sisters were planning to go to Liberty Village again in a week. To see the self-government of that village, and their matter of renting land to build a factory could also be decided by the village council. But now they cannot go to Liberty Village, because their father's friend Jiang Jingrong is coming to Shanghai on Monday. Didn't the telegram from their father ask them to go to Shanghai to meet him? The telegram also said: all the funds will be remitted by him, and they need funds to prepare everything, so they have to contact him. Their father's telegram also said that he had run a silk weaving factory and had experience, and that he was also one of the shareholders, and they should go to see him in person. Maybe he was the one who initiated the silk weaving factory. Their father's telegram was brief and did not say anything in detail, asking them to go and see him in person, maybe there were many things to discuss. Their father specifically mentioned these in the telegram, which could be seen. Moreover, they have no experience in running a factory at the moment, and this Mr. Jiang, since their father said that he has experience, they should ask him for advice on everything. It is said that running a silk weaving factory was not easy in the past, and the new ones they called electric silk weaving factories. Running a factory has a great relationship with the social environment. China's equipment is not complete, and the workers' skills are not advanced. No matter how great your ability is, you will often end up struggling and not getting anything in return. However, the purpose of opening silk weaving factories in China in the past was only to sell them domestically, which is not very similar to their intentions. If they only want to sell them domestically, then there are not a few newly established silk weaving factories now. China has been able to weave silk for thousands of years. They thought: in any case, this Mr. Jiang, their father said that he has experience, so he is stronger than those of them without experience. At this time, they had to go and discuss with Zhu Airen that they were going to Shanghai next Sunday and could no longer go to Liberty Village. That night, seeing that Zhu Airen had finished a day of medical work, the sisters came to Zhu Airen's room. As soon as they walked in, they saw Zhu Airen holding a few pink invitation cards in her hand, smiling and said: "I was just about to find you! We are going to another place next week, and we can't go to Liberty Village." He Liyu said: "What do you mean? We were also just about to find you, and also to tell you that we can't go to Liberty Village next week. You said you were going to another place, but where are you going?" Zhu Airen handed the invitation cards in her hand to them and said: "Look! Jin Danyun didn't tell me last time in Suzhou that the wedding day was next week, she is a very naughty person, but now she has sent an invitation card." (178)</p>

<h3>Nan Tiesheng Shows His Colors for the First Time; Zhang Eyun Makes a Comeback</h3>
<p>— Nai Wei</p>
<p>The first batch of actors at the Golden Grand Theater's autumn opening originally included Song Dezhu, one of the four famous dan performers, Yang Baosen, and Wu Yanheng, a martial arts actor. However, due to the Tianjin flood, these actors will not be able to come south for the time being. To remedy the situation, the Golden Grand Theater invited Nan Tiesheng to Shanghai (Nan Tiesheng had just gone north from Shanghai last month) to perform for one week.</p>
<p>Nan Tiesheng is from Hubei, born and raised in the old capital, a family of high-ranking officials, a scholarly family. His father, General Chao Yue, was the garrison commander of Wuhan. Tiesheng has a long history of performing in Wuhan. His first teacher was the famous amateur performer Cheng Junmou. In 1923, he made his debut, performing "Yutangchun." Because his singing, acting, and makeup resembled Wan Hua (Mei Lanfang), he was known as the "Mei Lanfang of Hankou." Later, he went north to Yan Zhao and joined the ranks of the veteran actor Wang Yaoqing. Yaoqing loved him very much and considered him the only talent after Zhang Xiaoshan (also a student of Yaoqing and an old amateur performer in the old capital). Tiesheng's art is entirely based on Wan Hua. Since he became a student of Yaoqing, he has combined the essence of Mei and Wang in one furnace. He has a good reputation in Wuhan, and insiders also praise him a lot. Tiesheng's voice is exceptionally sweet, and his singing and tune are wonderful. This time, he came to Shanghai from Wuhan and then went north, in response to the call of his teacher Wang Yaoqing. Because the owner of the Golden Grand Theater repeatedly invited him, he could not refuse, so he returned to Shanghai on the original route a few days ago. It is scheduled to perform at the Golden Grand Theater from the 8th for one week, with three days of warm-up plays: "Chunqiu Pei," "Deyi Yuan," "Xun Guan Niang" (daytime), and "Yuzhou Feng" (night). The Golden Grand Theater's original cast remains unchanged. New actors Lan Yuechun and Xiao Linghong will perform on stage at the same time as Tiesheng. In addition, because there is no suitable candidate for the young male role, the veteran actor Chen Tongyun has been invited to join. Tongyun's young male role is also considered typical. Ten years ago, he had a good reputation in the old capital and collaborated with the famous actor Xun Huisheng for a long time. After coming south, he retired and lived at home, only performing a few times at the banquets of Chen Meng Kui Long's family. This time, Tongyun will be able to perform on stage with Tiesheng at the same time, which is a great boon for the audience.</p>
<p>Nan Tiesheng's invitation to the Golden Grand Theater is only for one week. After Tiesheng finishes performing, kun performer Zhang Eyun (who came to Shanghai on the same rotation as Tiesheng a few days ago) will follow up and sing for one week. The young male role is still Chen Tongyun, and the invitation for the bearded male role is in progress, either An Shuyuan or Zhou Xiaotian. The greater possibility is An Shuyuan. Shuyuan has not been to the sea for many years. If it becomes a reality, he will perform with Tuiyun, and there will definitely be a grand occasion at that time. As for Song Dezhu, Yang Baosen, Wu Yanheng and his party, who are blocked in Beiping and cannot go, it is likely that they will come to Shanghai after Zhang Eyun finishes performing.</p>
<h3>The Theaters of the Wartime Capital</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>There were not many cinemas in Chongqing originally. The only ones with relatively complete facilities were "Cathay," "Xinchuan," and "Unique." After the May 4th fire, "Cathay" was burned down, "Xinchuan" was bombed, and the other cinemas also closed one after another. The only one that still maintained business in the midst of hardship was "Unique." The area of "Unique" is not very large, and part of it has been turned into a refugee shelter, so its position is even smaller. The cinema shows new defense films and valuable Soviet films produced by "China Made" and "China Electric." Recently, the cinema showed new defense films such as "Isolated City Bleeding" and "Blood Splattered Baoshan City," and Soviet films such as "Gorky's Childhood," "Female Warrior," "Crushing the Enemy's Nest," and "Maritime Guard." Not long ago, the cinema also screened an anti-Nazi film "Professor Mamen" produced by the Soviet Leningrad Film Studio, which was protested by the German ambassador and caused a lot of twists and turns. As a result, it continued to be screened. When the Soviet-German agreement was signed, the new Soviet ambassador Pan Youxin applied to stop the screening, and the cinema changed to screen the new "China Made" film "Good Husband."</p>
<p>On July 3, the city of Chongqing was attacked at night, and the backstage and screen of the "Unique" cinema were all bombed. According to the usual practice, it could not be reopened, but "Unique" still persevered and held the spirit of excellence.</p>

<p>In the corner that was bombed, a temporary cloth screen was built, and it was reopened as usual, but only one show was screened at night, and the situation was quite like that of Madrid.</p>
<p>The walls of the "Cathay" cinema that were burned down in the fire have now been completely repaired, and it will also be opened soon. The purpose of opening the cinema is mainly to make money, so it will still show the consistent American soft films, but the Chongqing Garrison Command believes that American soft films are not suitable for opening in the wartime capital, and it is said that it will issue a warning to the cinema to stop it.</p>

<h3>"Children of the Storm" Did Not Encounter "The Robbery of Peach and Plum"; The Kidnapping of Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er Is Not True</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>—— Zheng Junli's wife Huang Chen Talks About Returning to Chongqing from Shaanxi ——</p>
<p>Although Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er did not cooperate on many films, none of them were not famous works. Their special style and excellent performances were by no means accidental, but had their own superior talent and unique experience.</p>
<p>After the August 13th Incident, the two of them left the isolated island of material and vain enjoyment and went to Hankou, and jointly joined the China Film Studio. Last year, they co-starred in a new defense film "Eight Hundred Heroes," which was released and well received. Later, when the Chinese army withdrew from Wuhan, "China Made" moved to Chongqing, and Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er also went west with them.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Yuan Muzhi was assigned by an official of "China Made" to go to northern Shaanxi to shoot news films on the ground. At the same time, he also followed the Eighth Route Army to engage in drama work in the guerrilla areas. Chen Bo'er also left Chongqing soon after and came to Shaanxi to participate in the work.</p>
<p>Recently, "China Made" actor Dai Hao returned to Chongqing from northern Shaanxi. According to him, Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er set off from the Eighth Route Army Detachment Headquarters in western Shanxi on July 21. They risked crossing the cordon, hoping to go deep into the interior to engage in propaganda work. When they passed Tianjiazhai, they wanted to continue to venture forward, but they were discovered by Japanese sentries and were both kidnapped. Yuan Muzhi was shot and killed for trying to escape, and Chen Bo'er was taken to the "Division Headquarters." Their life or death is still unknown.</p>
<p>When Chongqing learned of this bad news, it was greatly shocked, and the Associated Press and Express News also sent this news to various places. As a result, newspapers in Hong Kong and Shanghai published it one after another, causing everyone to feel infinite anxiety. However, because the news came so abruptly, it was ultimately difficult to believe. Now, friends of Yuan and Chen in Chengdu have specially established a preparatory committee for this matter, preparing to first start to visit the whereabouts of Yuan and Chen. If they are unfortunately found to have died for real, then they will start preparing for the memorial service. However, according to Ms. Huang Chen, the wife of Zheng Junli, who had just returned to Chongqing from northern Shaanxi, this news is absolutely untrue, because she had met Yuan and Chen once before leaving Shaanxi!</p>
<p>From this point of view, then Yuan and Chen are still safe and sound. We wish them well here.</p>
<h3>Hopes for the Song and Dance World</h3>
<p>— Liang Yan</p>
<p>—— Everyone should write some more vigorous plays</p>
<p>I think no one will deny that the song and dance troupes currently performing in Shanghai are in the darkest process. Although half of it is caused by the environment, it is not without reason that they have given up on themselves. It is as if a child who has just left the arms of his parents can now be unrestrained and unruly. Adults use songs and dances such as grass skirts to attract audiences with lust to maintain their lives.</p>
<p>I think that the current song and dance troupes, having a large audience, should also fulfill some responsibilities to the society and the country, and should write some more vigorous plays in the songs and dances. If you break superstition, promote domestic goods, help refugees, and promote justice, etc., you must not think that every move will be stopped by the environment. For example, several troupes are now performing plays such as "The Autocratic Empress" and "Rejecting Drugs," which are all good works with profound meaning and easy to understand.</p>
<p>Recently, I happened to go to the New World Amusement Park and saw the "Yunshang Great Song and Dance Troupe" performing, and the results were good, which is very rare. The troupe has none of the corrupt situations of other troupes, there are many talents, and the band is neat, which is indeed outstanding among the song and dance troupes. It is said that the director of the troupe is movie star Ma Loufen. This gentleman has a lot of experience in song and dance, and it is expected that he will make a contribution, but what we hope is: to eliminate the remaining poison in the song and dance troupes as much as possible, and to write some more vigorous opera.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Chronicles of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Busy Theatergoers and "Eating Flying"</p>
<p>Furthermore, they want to boast before their peers, saying a certain boss is generous to me, a certain elder is generous to me. Especially when they are in public places, or in tea houses, restaurants, or bathhouses, they deliberately raise their voices, repeating the same thing over and over again. Such self-promotion and intentional publicity are indeed quite beneficial to them. Their intention is simply to let society know that they have a close relationship with the leading actors of the Pear Garden. Then, when high-ranking officials, dignitaries, gentry, and wealthy families have large theatrical performances, they can be found to act as theatrical organizers, or they can be entrusted to invite actors on their behalf. In this way, they will have income; maybe they can even earn one or two thousand dollars. Such people can be considered top-notch busy theatergoers, and the actors dare not despise them too much. The most pitiful are those shameless, disrespectful fellows who, when they have nothing to do, specialize in running to the actors' lodgings, regardless of whether people pay attention to them or not, always sitting until the bench leg breaks without leaving, trying to chat with the leading actors, who ignore them. As soon as they step out of the door, they hear people laughing and scolding. However, they are not annoyed at all. As soon as a certain actor's theater has a performance, they rush to applaud and shout "Bravo!" shouting until their throats are hoarse, but they are reluctant to buy a pot of tea (of course, the theater ticket is obtained for free). Their hands are shaken red and swollen, causing the official customers in front, behind, left, and right (who all paid for their tickets) to sneer and glare at them. But they don't care and still try hard to shout. When a certain actor's performance ends, and the theater owner sends the day's earnings, this gentleman can actually get one or two dollars of income. Although this amount of money is very small, it is extremely difficult to write an appropriate name for it when the accounts are opened. (93)</p>
