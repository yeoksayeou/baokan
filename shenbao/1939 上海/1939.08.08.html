<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本加入德義同盟否？</h3>
<p>在東京談判停頓，英法軍事代表啟程赴蘇的時候，久趨沉寂的日本加入德義同盟問題，忽又喧騰起來。日駐義大使白鳥興駐德大使大島鋪張揚厲的秘密會議，表示日本即將加入德義同盟。其實，日德義的軍事合作，本質上不是一件新奇的事情；而新奇的趣味，在於三國的軍事同盟與英國的外交政策，在時間上相錯綜配合。</p>
<p>原來日本與德義的三國集團，不但政治的臭味相投，侵略的同惡相濟；即如日本駐德義二大使的悉由軍人充任，情報的交換，參謀人員來往的頻繁，德義對日供給飛機軍火，寺內大角二將的訪問柏林，凡此種種，就足說明三國雖未締結軍事盟約，但它他的反共約早就充溢了火藥氣息！不但如此而已，它們行動呼應，早給符節；日人石丸籐太說：「太平洋問題與歐洲問題有不即不離的關係。例如在慕尼黑協定時，德義的勝利，由於日本在遠東的聲援，使英國有所顧忌，不能不對德屈膝」。又說「在他方面，慕尼黑會議中德國的勝利，暴露了英國的弱點，使日本攻略廣東與海南島更容易。總之，太平洋爭霸戰與歐洲爭霸戰是息息相關的。這就是英美所包圍的日本，既與德義相攜手，便摧毀了包圍陣的一角；展開了「無」的國家對「有」的國家的共同戰線的結果。」</p>
<p>覷破了日本與德義的關係，便不覺得所謂締結軍事同盟，此數年來的實際侵略更有注意的價值。但是歐洲的和平政治家不願如此理解；它他雖目視覩了好幾種國際契約一張一張的撕毀了，仍以為契約有時而靈驗的。對於日德義三國閃圖訂方軍事盟約，始終認為比現實的流血，或不流血的殺人亡國，更為嚴重。這種態度，卻為日本所覷破。因此之故，日本方面無論是竭力主張締結三國盟約的極端派，或是反對接受軍事約束的溫和派，剛柔相濟地表演準備締結盟約的種種姿態。例如最近大島白鳥兩大使的會面，其性質上是應該秘密的，其任務上至多是交換意見，貢獻之於東京；它他即沒有決定國策之權，又不是對於駐在國進行外交；但是大搖大擺，大吹大擂，惟恐人之不理會；試問這種姿態，表演給誰看？窺測其意，不外下例幾種作用：　恫嚇英國。二月之前，日本當局極沉默，而它他的報紙形形色色的宣傳：當局「不加入德義同盟」；結果使英國首相張伯倫氏再三表白心跡，謂反侵略陣線不關遠東；又使他接受了天津租界的包圍而提議東京談判，並且成立了初步屈辱的妥協。現在英國態度又因環境而稍趨強硬，東京談判擱淺，於是日本一面由東京各報大呼「英國如不理會日本要求，則會議即將決裂」，一面又大放其日本即將加入德義軍事同盟的空氣，終期使英國對日本條件屈服。　另一種作用，就在希圖破壞正在進行中的英蘇合作。英蘇談判進行雖然民主遲緩，但最近英法軍事代表已啟程到莫斯科去，與蘇聯舉行參謀部談話；這表示英法蘇的關係已有若幹的進步。在這時候，日本忽表示將與德義締結同盟，這不但對英國的恐嚇，同時使法國不放膽的跟緊英國跑。</p>
<p>日本是否加入德義軍事同盟有待事實的證明，即使加入，壓根兒不是新奇的東西。英國「強硬報」所說，「日本向德義兩國合作愈益密切，則美國蘇聯與西歐各民治國之聯帶關係，亦必愈益堅固」。這是日本所徘徊瞻顧的。</p>

<h3>汕市之荒亂雜景　日軍宣傳反英　英領事竟被辱</h3>
<p>汕頭通信、沿海日軍、邇來專事游擊、蓋即以聲東擊西之法、選擇沿海交通要點、乘虛突擊、冀以少數兵力佔之、再移作別圖、目的在利用艦隊轉運之便、以少數兵力、牽掣華軍主力於一隅、造成膠着情態之後、潮揭方面、兩軍現已入於相持狀態、日軍忽轉移於汕尾、二十日侵犯汕尾挫折、又轉擾大亞灣·澳頭·中山縣橫門·芙蓉山·玻璃圍等地、近又集中艦隊於大亞灣、進擾碭石、此無非以游攻詭計、以亂華軍耳目、及更番滋擾也、</p>
<p>汕頭市區、因韓江　江船隻不通、與各縣昔信隔絕、柴·炭·米·水油·鹽·菜·肉·蛋·一概缺乏、日軍全靠臺灣方面運到罐頭食品接濟、未逃走之民衆、如禁在籠中、電燈機器全燬、自來水廠水塔、總喉全燬、民間食水、全賴苦力烟友向火車站河中挑來、上月每担大洋四角、現在要一元以上、因烟友流氓等、多已做僞官、不複爲挑水工作矣、且河水極爲不潔、因河畔堆滿死尸、無人殮埋、致居民飲者、發生癘疫、醫生與藥材兩缺、死後又無棺木殮埋、日軍又不許人行善施賑、其情狀極悲慘也、</p>

<h3>刦後之定海　市面極爲冷落</h3>
<p>定海通信、定海淪陷後、迄已月餘、各大商店、雖大多被迫復市、但因居民不敢出門購物、故門可羅雀、生意極爲淸淡、又大多居民、雖皆返城、因懼日軍橫行、故皆深居簡出、允其靑年婦女及壯丁等、街上均告絕跡、稍膽大之老年人等、亦只在畫間行走、一到傍晚、則都歸家、至日軍因恐華方游擊隊襲擊、故各處皆派兵放哨，每、一城門口，有六七人駐守、入晚、即緊閉城門、至八時、實施戒嚴、故市面極為冷落、</p>

<h3>西南旅行實錄（續）</h3>
<p>三·過河內</p>
<p>法政府除把河內造成一個政治中心以外、（總督駐在地）還想把它造成一個交通的中心、所以在地圖上南至西貢、東至海防、西北到昆明、東北到諒山同登的鐵路綱、都以河內為核心、不過除第一條到西貢的路綫是的確在河內出發以外、其餘幾條、事實上是集中在河內東二十餘里的嘉林地方、出嘉林到河內、僅是總攬滇越路·及其支綫的一段而已、我們從海防到諒山、便在這一段上進出兩决、時間上實在是很不經濟的、</p>
<p>要想一天走完海防至諒山間的路程、非在早上動身不可、由海防開的第一班慢車、（快車不能隨身多帶行李）把我們帶上征途、行車時、顛播極烈、聲浪允震耳欲聾、這大概是路軌的磅份太輕、或車行太速的關係、沿途逢站必停、停時、有大批安南人上落、他們不管車箱如何擁擠、總是把整担東西往車上搬、有的簡直把全副家私搬上、弄得車上連容膝之地都沒有、我們看見一個挑金魚担的人、用盡氣力、祇齊準半付担子、可是車已毫不容情地開動了、其餘半副担子、便掛在外邊蕩着、眼看上面的缸甏之類、一件件因離心力而拋出車外、最後到下一站停下時、祗剩幾條乾涸的，金魚、</p>
<p>車到嘉林、停留的十五分鐘、到一昆明去的旅客、都在這裏下車、旁邊月台上、已有從河內開出的滇越路車在等着、這忽忽轉駁的一刹那、情况很是緊張、嘉林開出五分鐘後、便過建築在富良江（紅河）上的大橋、這是一遠東最長的鐵橋、全長兩公里半、火車以每小時十五公里的速度開行、需十分鐘方走完全程、富良江在中國雲南境內發源稱元江、入安南後、挾泥沙甚多、水成紅色、所以俗稱紅河、水勢極急湍、河內到處有漩渦、小船都靠漩渦的邊上走、一不留心、便有覆舟的危險、大橋建築的地方、（河心）有一片很大的沙洲、把河身分做兩支、所以火車開過的時候、好像楚經兩條河面、橋的西端、便是河內支站、再過去才是河內總站、</p>
<p>從河內到諒山和同登的火車、淸晨和午間各有一决、海防頭班火車到河內、可啣接午間開同登的車、其間還有三小時的休息、可在市中小作遊覽、河內開出、經嘉林、方折向東北、全程一六二公里、前半段係平原、後半段全是山路、火車在羣山間環繞而行、紆迴曲折、風景頗佳、廊佳以上、歧路較多、所以在後面加車頭、以收推挽合作之效、傍晚、到諒山、即下車投宿、因同登市面較差、食宿都不很方便、有許多到同登工作的人、晌晚仍在諒山住宿、而且到龍州的汽車、也由諒由出發、所以住諒山比較妥當、</p>
<p>四·中越交界的同登</p>
<p>諒山至同登間的鐵路、築成還不久、過同登便是中國廣西的憑祥縣境（鎭南關）、那些辦理貨物運輸的行家、都有專人派駐這裹、從諒山到同登、計程十四公里、除火車以外、每日有固定的汽車開駛、諒龍路的公共汽車、也經過此處、出入境的護照、都在這里裏簽騐、騐照處原在海關附近、現已遷至邊境柵口、下了火車、須步行一段路、小汽車可直達、由安南出境時、海關比蛟隨便、除大批的貨物外、普通行李、可不受檢查、但檢護照和簽字、有時也相當麻煩、說不定要等上一二個鐘頭、同時有許多安南公差之類的人物、打起笑臉來冋你照呼、問你護照送進去沒有、或是要不要去代催一聲等類的話、這些人都是想撈一點零錢的、可千萬不要開發、因爲他們實際上可效勞的程度極微、要是給了一個、他們會互通消息、川流不息地我你、反將生出種種麻煩、護照騐畢、出境手續便完備、司通過一條鐵練所製成的柵鬥、從這柵門到中國邊境、還有四僅是程、但已沒有什麽關阻了、</p>
<p>自同登入桂、有兩路可循、一是乘諒龍路公共汽車至龍州、（每日對開一班）全程十九公里、如同登騐照和隘口海關無問題、的三小時可達、如須到南寗、可於翌日再乘龍邕路公共汽車、二四九公里的路程、八小時可到、假如從諒山或同登出發、一天便趕到南寗、便祗有雇小車前往、那末、二百七十公里路、九小時左右便可走完、</p>
<p>五·從鎮到南關到南寗</p>
<p>汽車從同登開出後四公里、便可看到一塊寫着「車行至此靠左邊走」的藍底白字木牌、這便是中越接境的界石、司機駕車至此、必須一改他在安南境內所染的靠右邊走的習慣、而改爲靠左、從這裹過去一箭之地、便屹立着雄偉的鎮南關　、</p>
<p>鎮南關門的兩旁、我們第一次看到各種標語、不覺起了親切之感、尤其是關頂隨風飄揚的國旗、在翠綠的叢山中映出鮮明的色彩、堞樓上是守望者的宿舍、樓角有一位哨兵、正用全副精神注視着關內關外、防止奸宄的混入、車行過此、必須至邊防公署投騐護照上簽字、盤查後方能進關、（未完）</p>

<h3>投機操縱之風未戢　金融昨仍混亂　外匯縮黃金漲公債跌　各種謠言已證實無稽</h3>
<p>上海金融市塲、因投機者之造謠、企圖操縱牟利、以致市塲於上星期六起發生波動、今雖以事實證明謠言之無稽、而中國政府對穩定幣制之決心、決不有所變更、關於上海等淪陷區域法幣、更有</p>
<p>充實準備通貨膨脹之說、絕對不確、於是金融市塲謠言、昨日起已漸平息、而投機商本其操縱之技能、繼續猛扒外滙操縱金市、以致昨日之金融市塲、依然混亂、例如外滙黑市續趨緊勢、</p>
<p>匯豐掛牌仍舊不動、實際行市英滙爲四辦士〇六二五、美滙爲七元九三七五、黃金暗市上午收盤三千八百四十元、下午收盤三千九百六十元、</p>
<p>證券暗市繼續低落、甲乙丙丁戊五種、各跌五角至七角半不等、滙劃貼水、站在一百九十五元至二百零五元之間、又新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、中國政府以其全力</p>

<h3>上海畸形發展　已趨沒落　法文報之預測　六個月後瓦解</h3>
<p>據法文北平政聞報載、上海訊、自一九三八年初以來、發生有非常之人造景氣、而其原因、則由於各地之難民紛集、均携有若干儲蓄、以來滬消費、而此非常時之景氣乃生矣、聞此等儲蓄、多投於各種小工業中、惟近自。</p>
<p>物價騰漲不已後、故該項小工業、已甚難發展、依一般人觀測、遲早之間、此等難民儲蓄耗盡、勢須另遷生活較低之地點、以渡餘年、然而現在租界內之居民、已深感有</p>
<p>生活難支之痛苦、若一旦還鄉運動爆發以後、則其勢定將不可壓止、則現時租界中、方感有人滿之患者、勢必有巨大之反應、依一般經濟家推測、在六個月以後、租界內之房屋、現已租出一空者、屆時當有</p>
<p>空屋無人之苦矣、若在該時、果發現有如是現象、則仍留滬之人、當感有若干之舒適、但此或少數中之又少數者、而在該時則畸形之景氣、亦當壽終正寢、</p>
<h3>華軍別動隊　已打通蘇嘉路　游擊隊在崑山與日交綏滬西虹橋路形勢甚緊張</h3>

<p>滬郊四週　活躍益甚</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、中國新四路軍部隊　來已抵更迫近上海四週之各區、而表示活躍益甚、眾信此與八一三滬戰爆發兩週紀念日有關、據日軍當局聲稱、上海區日駐軍採取主動、對抗游擊隊之潛入、八月二日青浦與七實附近均發生戰事、八月三日嘉定以北發生更爲激烈之戰事、日兵五名受傷、其他猶有較小之交綏數决、日方揚言巳完全擦制局勢、而作極充量之防範、</p>
<p>滬西虹橋　斷絕交通</p>
<p>自新四軍開到滬郊後、各處游擊隊、異常活躍、故虹僑路日兵檢查往來旅客、更形嚴密、昨日上午、該處斷絕交通、鄉民均繞道大西路出入、惟不久即行開放、</p>

<p>昨日上午七時半、有日本銀色雙翼水上飛機一架、在滬西虹橋路上空往來盤旋低飛偵察、的半小時、始向西南飛去、至九時二十分鐘、叉有灰色轟炸機一架、由西北飛向東南方面而去、</p>

<p>兩性醫學</p>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<h3>勿創傷了有關幸福的機能</h3>
<p>欲在愛情上獲得一致，及產生優秀子女以繁衍子嗣者，第一問題，就是要看體力的是吾健全，本來男女的結合，爲的是愛的交流，所以健全的性機能，不啻是開啓男女間幸福的鑰匙</p>
<p>假使我們人類全體都去求這「以完全脫離肉體爲終結」的理想，那麼不久我們就會看見環境會大大地改變，而人類就要絕滅了。</p>
<p>我們終究是生物之一，生物界天然有兩大慾望，一是食慾，二是愛情，這兩大慾望，吾人應該加以好好地遵守，食慾旣須求其衛生，那末，愛慾何嘗不然。故如誤用肉體，或愚昧無知創傷了有關幸福的性機能，那眞不堪設想了。</p>
<p>從愛人的甜美和嬌艷的體格裏——這體格是動物原始的本能使得我們愛的不單生出新生命來，並且還能擴大人類同情的範圍，增加精神上的了解，照事實上講，愛力是奠定夫婦間愛情的基礎，一切快樂的來源，都可在性力中取之不盡，用之不竭，其潛勢力的確偉大。</p>
<p>所以男女間的樂趣在雙方愛的接觸後，就會自然產生。男子除了完全腎萎之外，都可以充分享受。女子則不然，若碰到男子精力渙散而患有早洩者，則甜蜜的夢就要消逝了。</p>
<p>這種早洩與腎萎毛病，實不宜稍加放任，確有治療的必要，其罹患原因，除自凟過度及結婚過早之外，厥屬婚後縱慾與荒淫染毒而來，此時應積極施以睪丸內分泌療法，方可恢復原來健全的愛力，說到這裏，我當以臨床十六年的經騐，來闡明現在醫學家一致推崇的眞正睪丸精質製劑「補體康」對於本症治療上的功效。</p>
<p>「補體康」功能促進每個細胞的繁榮，培補腦力，增長發育，未老先衰服之，可以返老還童，治早洩腎痿如風掃落葉一，証實其藥力在短時間內卽生精補腎，然後伉儷間的愛情方可協調。</p>

<h3>健康是成功之母</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>偉大領業之成就，全憑其精神身體之健全，因爲身體精神的健全，一切行事，均有精神作爲後盾，彼叱咜風雲之梟雄如墨索里尼希特勒之輩，皆有其堅靭果毅之精神足獲致之。可之事業可爲。而此種弼毅之精神，固多出於健康之體格也。以一般而言，人之體格不甚懸殊，而多由後天之摧殘，如過度之煩勞，未臻發育而先自破身，濫施自凌，早婚，便賴爲發育之靑春腺，頓受陣礙。喪失健康之基礎，凡患下部發育不全之人，其精神大多萎糜困頓，肌肉鬆懈，尤其因發育不全，遺精早洩之靑年，意志更爲頹唐。如此而欲事業飛黃騰達，等於要在水巾撈月，爲絕對不可能之事。</p>
<p>不過有許多名人，其初並不是說個個是守身如玉，而身身健康，精神活潑，然而終能成就不朽之事業者，良以能及時挽救。而「補體康」一藥，實爲一般因靑春發育時代；濫施自凟，早婚，房事失節，勤勞過度等而失去健康之最好良藥，許多大事業家早年因斷喪過甚，獲「補體康」而依然得到恢復健康，以致終能達到樹立大業之目的，並獲到夫婦愛情濃郁，白頭偕老也。世有在靑年時代，或幼年時代，因自凟，早婚，房事不節，而至中年性能减弱，記憶力缺乏，精神頹廢，工作不感興趣，事業無成者，能速行服用「補體康」自能挽救，只要服用「補體康」一瓶，精神即吿抖奮，肌肉充實面部紅潤而有光彩。一切均可恢復靑春的時代。</p>
<h3>肺病宜早省悟</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>大都數的肺病患者，時起一二聲之輕欽，或有劇烈之咳嗽喀，食慾減退，精神萎頓，體重乃日就減輕，於是癆損之症遂成矣。若能在此際予以切實之治療，卽可望其根治，且收效亦易，倘延至重篤之二三兩期，則非有長久之時期，不能治愈。故肺病患者應宜早治療爲要，然要適合治癆之內服劑，木亦難事，此爲余臨床二十年來恒所感到者。惟自德國徒梅博士發明「補肺拿爾」使得豁然而解。蓋「補肺拿爾」之藥效，有減除肺病酸素之功，而使肺病菌失去其活動之力，故癆症喀血，咳嗽咯痰，胸痛盜汗及潮熱，服之無不霍然。</p>
<h3>遺精治愈例　先天不足的遺精</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>患者萬成德，年二十歲，（自訴）本人因先天不足，故自小羸弱多病，叉因病後失調，致身體衰頹不堪，十七歲時即有遺精，時雖服藥治療，而無寸尺之效，至今遺精頻繁，發育不全，生殖器如小兒無異，且腦弱失眠，特此求治。（治癒經過）乃囑其攝取富有滋養物，投以「耐而斯遺精片」以止遺精，再兼服德國男用「補體康」每日三决以補之，經三月之治療，遺精已無，發育已完全恢復。</p>
<h3>自凟斵傷的遺精</h3>
<p>患者凌奇海，年二十三歲。（自訴）早年變淫書之害，而犯自凟惡習，每夜爲之，精血大爲耗費，半年後即有遺精，因未加治療，致病勢漸趨惡化，現見色即洩，腦弱無神，痛苦萬狀（治愈經過）每日電療十五分鍾，服大量之「耐而斯遺精片」及「補體康」，連治三月有餘，健康漸次恢復。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<h3>樂極生悲不必悲</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>以一般而論，患淋病的都是與不潔之娼妓接觸而來，所以有人説這是樂極生悲之結果。而不知此等種悲哀，並非無法爲之解脱者。良以現在因科學進歩，此種難治之淋病，已爲科學所征服，此種一向被人視爲魔病樣的白濁，終於徹底根本解决了。</p>
<p>惟是在余二十餘年經騐之下，許多病家，終身不能脱離此病魔之毒爪，而厭厭以待斃者，亦非少數。如此，豈非一染淋病，即終生不能享受康健之樂趣，所謂一朝風流，百年遺恨者乎？實則未必盡然，蓋用此輩誤信一般誇大之廣女，説服一二瓶，一二次治療，即可完全根治，此真出乎情理之外，背離科學萬里。要之淋病之治療，是重在實際，不重口頭和筆底的宣傳，與實際上之淋病，毫不相干，一般病家之所以往往陷於悲觀之境者，大概都被那般遠離科學事實的療法所誤，就余實際之二十餘年臨床所經騐，先宜作精密的診斷，而後决定其妥善的療法，在足使病家引起悲觀之淋病，厥爲慢性淋之變症。其毒素遍於全身，此時宜用徳國抗淋血淸，並內服淋病特效「克淋儂」使全身細胞完全發生抗淋噬菌作用，則所有匿居深處的淋菌，徹底肅淸，但亦須三五星期可以根治。許多淋病的悲觀者，往往服「克淋儂」而全治　診時：上午十時至十二時。自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角。並送價值一元之「性病全書」一册。</p>

<h3>秋汛首次高潮　黃浦江潮水將登岸</h3>
<p>上海黃浦江之高潮、將於本月十五日起正式發軔、屆時潮水將自沿江之處登陸、極堪重視、</p>
<p>秋汛開端</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉本月八日起開始步入秋令、今年首次高潮、亦繼往於本月十五日起猝發、並十七日之高潮其漲勢、有超過外灘駁岸之可能、故屆時潮水將灌登陸上、而造成相當嚴重之水患也、</p>
<p>首次高潮</p>
<p>查本月十五日起第一次秋汛高潮、連續達一星期之久、其發潮時間及發足數量、已經濬浦總局水理科測定、計十五日晨前十二時閒之潮數量爲十一呎七寸半、午後零時五十分之潮爲十呎五寸、</p>
<p>最堪注意</p>
<p>自是發潮繼漲增高、十六日晨前十二時四十六分之潮爲十二呎四寸四、午後一時三十一分之潮爲十一呎八寸、允以十七日晨前一時三十分之潮最堪注意、竟達十三呎一寸五分、午後二時十分之潮爲十一呎七寸、</p>
<p>水量甚鉅</p>
<p>十八日起、水位亦高、晨前二時十四分之潮爲十二呎八寸、午後二時四十九分之潮爲十一呎九寸、十九日晨前三時之潮爲十二呎四寸、午後三時二十六分之潮爲十一呎七寸四分、</p>
<p>共計七天</p>
<p>從二十日起水量稍落晨前三時三十八分之潮爲十二呎一寸、午後四點零七分之潮爲十一呎五寸半、二十一日晨前四時二十分之潮爲十呎零五寸半、午後五時之潮爲十呎零六寸半、以上共計七天、</p>
<p>潮必登岸</p>
<p>按外灘一帶駁岸、其高度祇十三英尺、較之十七日之潮、其高度超過駁岸一寸半、則潮水自必泊泊由岸灌陸、如遇疾風暴雨、則上海所遭遇之水息、更堪憂慮云、至高潮期馬路低處積水之爲患、自屬必然性也、</p>

<p>名妓文弟老四應慧貞（即廣西路武陵坊二百三十三號文弟書寓主政）結識、自軍興以還、杭垣淪陷、高乃遷家、來居上海、於是高振宜與文弟老四之過往更密、高深知老四頗有積蓄、且婦女求利之心必熾、遂於去年秋間突向老四揚言、彼現擬集合大批資本、向內地採辦棉花鹽米等物、運滬銷售、必可立獲厚利、爾有意營此乎、文弟老四</p>
<p>惑於商言且以高乃富家子弟、必無他意、遂陸續給付高現款四萬數千元、及價値二千二百元之鑽石四十三粒、作爲資本、同時由文弟老四更勸其素識之吳太太（即住居威海衛路祥麟里一百五十四號、新近被綁之吳子深之妻、）入股二千元、徐樓氏（住福煦路安樂邨二號）入股九千元、顧幗英（住福煦路叫明邨一〇九號）入股現款三千元、及價値八千一百元之鑽戒二只、張秀珍、（住蒲石路平安里五號）入股上海銀行</p>
<p>存摺三扣計一萬五千元、現鈔二千元、總計經文弟老四交高之款不下八九萬元、乃高於得款之後、並不經營所謂棉花鹽米事業、而竟即以此款流連於愚園路好萊塢·秋月·海格路曹家波榮生公司等賭窟、數月以來、耗去大半、更以經營日金票匯票等叉遭虧蝕、致所騙得之財、盡行耗盡、而於文弟等之前、則諉稱貨物米到、或給付相常利息、以爲搪塞、乃直至現今、始經文弟老四</p>
<p>察覺其詐遂報吿老閘捕房、由華探長龐瑞卿·在家駒·探員曹岐山·偵察高之踪跡、直至昨晨一時半、高由愚園路好萊塢。秋月·等賭窟出外、經過憶定盤路時、爲探等弋獲、昨晨解送特一法院刑四庭、捕房律師張師竹略陳案情、以本件尙須偵查、故請准予暫行覊押、候查明訴究、詰之高供、該款因余所經營之江西路新華銀號失敗而借貸者、並非詐騙云云、經方慶還推事核供、乃諭高振宜還押、改期再訊、</p>

<h3>向日商紗廠定購棉紗　跑街舞弊侵佔　兩次騙款萬餘盡負賭窟</h3>
<p>常州人奚文光（又名奐佐才、）年二十一歲、向在江西路四百零六號求興紗廠爲跑街、本年四月十七日、奉店主之命、向芝蘭街同德里六號公記紗號足購七月份棉花一百包、先付百分之零五定款、計二千五百元、當由奚於事後將</p>
<p>定單</p>
<p>交與店主、乃至六月一日、奚又經主人給以浙江興業銀行支票一紙、囑向同興紗廠定購棉紗三百包、亦經奚將定單付給店中詛奚所給付店中之公記紗號同興紗廠定單、係屬竊得、而僞刻公記紗號之</p>
<p>圖章</p>
<p>及同興負責人日人寺內小高之私章、加蓋於上、實際並未向以上兩家定購棉紗、而將一萬二千五百元之定洋、私行侵佔、分存於交通等銀行、於是即每晚至愚園路好萊塢賭窟以及榮生公司等賭窟</p>
<p>狂賭</p>
<p>並時出入於各大舞塲、極力報效所悅之舞女、故未及一二月、已盡耗其資、銀行所存者、僅祇十四元數角而已、及至八月一日、店主向公記同興出貨、始發覺該兩定單係出諸僞造、乃報吿總巡捕房、由華探長楊培生·探目程仁昆·於六日將奚</p>
<p>拘獲</p>
<p>昨晨解送特一法院刑一庭、捕房律師蔣保廉陳明經過、因尙須偵査、故請求准予改期再訊、而奚亦延范剛兪恩良律師辯護、經蕭燮棻推事質訊之下、乃論令奚還押改期再訊、</p>

<p>一手把持自稱校長、查張輔華乃張婦在弄中拾得之棄兒、張婦無嗣、愛逾己出、惟張則因其自幼品行卑劣、屢欲驅逐出外、均經其母勸阻、不意張氏故後、輔華對母竟然忤逆、言行粗暴、親友向其勸解、亦遭拒絕、反而延請陳懋宜律師訂就合同、規定學校行政一切主權、均歸輔華永遠</p>
<p>單獨負責管理、不受任何人干涉迫張婦簽字、方充每月給付生活費五十元、張婦不允簽字、故彼不顧贍養、張姞因之常患咯血及氣喘等症、祇得避居婿家、近不得已延蔡疏影律師狀訴輔華請給扶養費、該校校董會鑒於輔華之</p>
<p>舉動乖謬學識幼雅、決非學校之福、爰於本年五月十日召開第四决校董會議、即席推聘沈榮華爲校長、乃新校長前往接收、彼又抗不移交、該案旣經法院審理、是非曲查、拭目視之、</p>

<h3>金融　投機大量扒結　外滙緊勢再接再厲　英匯突破四辦士　美金七元六二五</h3>
<p>昨為八月份第一個星期一、英國向例休假、香港亦停市、本市外商各銀行、因已改移至八月廿七日孔誕節休假故仍照常辦公、外匯市况、匯暨掛牌俱無上落、英美匯暗市、初因紗花帮拋塞於前、兼日行吐售繼後、故市勢穩中帶硬、嗣後華商投機家驟來傾扒、且洋行界亦有結款、致市象轉軟、惟午收英美匯尙與晨開相仿、收後因投機家繼續扒結、情勢步緊、午後因投機家洋行等與新豐合盛扒風愈厲、且日行正金等亦突來復進、並香港投機家來電購結、加以匯豐初時尙肯供結、但不久反來吸收、是以爲狀缺乏維持、續趨軟化、延至晚收、竟創見英金三辦士九〇六二五、美匯七元六二五之空前新緊價、已打破上月二十一日先令四辦士美匯七元七五之歷來最緊記錄、而本月份期貨情况、亦隨之先平而後步緊、終則英續緊一五六二五、美又貴二五、掉期因現貨與本月距離不大、致套利絕跡、現期交易尙旺、</p>
<p>日商先塞而後猛扒</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠期均長一二五、紐的銀貨停市倫教生金仍平、匯兌英對美。對法均平、對滬小一八七五、美對外各匯兌均休業無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士〇九三七五、美匯七元九三七五、較上週六午收、均無榮辱、開後華商紗花帮突來塞出、致爲狀頗穩計吐予華比等外行現貨英金四辦士一二五、並現貨美匯八元、時洋行結進匯豐現貨英金四辦士〇九三七五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉、悉無更動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉依然免微、此後日行亦來拋塞、兼華商仍有賣意、故市勢帶硬、計日行塞予外行現貨英金四辦士一二五、同時又與華商相繼售予大通等美行現貨美匯八元及八元〇三一二五、時英行有利吸進同行本月份美匯七元七五、嗣後華商投機家忽止塞力扒、且洋行界亦稍有結款、故市象轉軟、計投機家結進大通本月份美匯七元六八七五、繼又購結麥加利等外行現貨美匯七元九三七五、後再扒進麥加利華比現貨英金四辦士〇九三七五及〇六二五、時已午刻、午收銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士〇九三七五、美匯七元九三七五、木月份英金三辦士九三七五、美匯七元六二五、聞收後英金軟至四辦士〇三一二五、美匯亦緊至七元八七五、</p>
<p>匯豐午後反有吸收</p>
<p>後市洋行界頻來扒結、市勢愈緊、計洋行結進匯豐現貨英金四辦士、此後日行正金暨華商紗花帮亦競相猛扒、兼港方投機家亦來電扒結、加以匯豐中止供塞、而反來吸收、是以情勢更緊英金立破入四辦士關內、計日行正金與港方及華商等結進有利某行等外行現貨英金三辦士九三七五、並現貨美匯七元七五及六八七五、時匯豐吸進同行本月份英金三辦士八一二五、後某行塞予華商本月份美匯七元三七五、入後合盛新豐等洋行亦購結英行有利現貨美匯七元六八七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士九〇六一五、美匯七元六二五、本月份英金三辦士七五、美匯七元三一二五、結果比上週末、現貨英續緊一八七五、美又軟三一二五、本月份英緊一五八二五、美貴二五、</p>
<h3>外滙無巨量供給　黃金又近四千元關　若照英美匯計算　尙撳六百元有奇</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、初因人心恍惚、時進時出、且外滙穩定、無大變動、致價遂盤旋於三千八百元內外、一度曾退達三千七百七十五元低盤、午收則已回高至三千八百四十元、午後因外滙缺乏維待、市勢頓緊、英金竟破入四辦士關內、激動買風、一般業外買戶亦紛至沓來、且某外行亦來搜購、加以賣方供意驟淡、漲風再度爆發、竟打破三千九百元大關、一度曾高至三千九百七十元頂盤行將週近四千元大關、結果以三千九百六十元收盤、較上週末、又猛漲一百零五元、若照晚收英金內盤結價、爲四千五百五十元、美滙爲四千六百零五元七角、較以上價尙猛撳六百元有奇、此乃一部份富商因邇來國際局勢複雜、故藏儲心理外滙較黃金爲濃之故也、本日交易暢旺、的一千餘兩、銀樓飾金終則掛高十元、海關金與中英純金等仍呆而不動、</p>
<p>烚赤漲一零五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開人心本稍帶疲、且聞外滙頗穩、開市比上週末午收即做低五十五元、錢兌業賣予金號二十兩、價三千八百元、繼又疲落十元、現金號吐予某金號十兩、價三千七百九十元、時雖某金號止進塞出、無如錢兌業納胃甚健、市勢反動向上、不久即回高四十元、錢兌業進某金號十兩、價三千八百三十元、某金號復轉買風、力吸數十兩、致價步高、某金號進證券帮二十兩、價三千八百四十七兩、時證券帮復來吐售、加以某金號亦忽來復出、市象重疲、傾瀉七十二元、錢兌業賣予金號十兩、價三千七百七十五元、爲當日低盤、其時散戶趁低吸收頗力、致價重復回漲、未幾即回起三十七元、錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、價三千八百十二元、時聞外滙報秋、買方進意更切、某金號力吸數十兩、進現金號十兩、價三千八百三十元、繼又進同行五十兩、三千八百三十五元、後證券帮進銀樓帮十兩、爲三千八百四十元作午收便、午後因外滙英金已逼近四辦士關邊、買氣頗濃、開市即狂抬四十元、某金號進錢兌業十兩、價三千八百八十元、時錢兌業殷富吸購、衝出三千九百元關外、錢兌業進現金號三十兩、價三千九百十元、後銀樓帮稍來塞出、一度回挫、銀樓帮賣予某金號二十兩、價三千八百八十元、此後聞滙市英金破入四辦士關內、買風又熾、某銀號及錢兌業等爭前力吹、又飛漲九十元、錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、價三千九百七十元、後某金號與證券帮忽趁高脫售、立即回降五十五元、錢兌業吐予金號十兩、價三千九百十五元、入後因外滙絕無廻顧、以當日最緊價收盤、某銀號與散戶等又起買風、重昂至三千九百七十元、為當日高峯、二時二十分後因錢兌業獲利脫售、遂稍回挫、錢兌業賣予余號三十兩、價三千九百四十元、三時三十分錢兌業互做二十兩、三千九百六十元、作晚收價、結果比上週六又續漲一百零五元、查已連漲三元、共計三百六十元、聞收後某錢兌業獲利吐予同業二十兩、又某銀號五十兩、價均三千九百七十元、全天一百九十五元上落、現金號之本牌金照炩赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢鮮聞做開、</p>
<p>飾金高懸四百元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百九十元、迨至九時三十元掛小五元、十時回上五元、十時十五分又掛低五元、十二時十分回高五元、下午二時掛大五元、二時三十五分又高五元、此後無變化、結果軋漲十元、計大同行改懸四百元、新同行爲三百九十八元、收進的咸低二十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣高峯迭見　英金鎊九十四元半　美金元售九十八元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣因外滙軟弱、英滙已破四辦士關、烚赤暗盤做四千零二十元、英美金鎊、供給絕稀、市况甚堅、英美金票、需要更殷、上升甚烈、市間流通稀少、不易購得、香港法郞票、皆視爲珍品、坎拿大票斐律濱票等、追隨激漲、澳金票一漲三元、黑市無從穩定、外幣高峯、絡續發現、日金票影響頗微、晚市爲一元零九分二厘、朝鮮票晚市爲九角、公會交易未暢、勤泰出英金票十鎊、萬康出美金票五十元、鎰康出美金票一百五十元、皆由森泰購進、又寳大出仁泰進美金票二百元、昨日市價、英美鎊各升一元、英金票升二元、美金票升五角四分、香港票升一角、法郞票升一分九厘、新加坡票升一角、雖比票升一角五分、坎拿大票升二角、斐律濱票升三角、義大利票升二分、澳金票升三元、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>銀行公會通告　收受中農外埠鈔票</h3>
<p>本市自停用津魯漢地名鈔票後、其他外埠地名鈔票、亦隨之拒用、市面常有糾紛發生、一般小錢莊與銀號以掉換外埠地名鈔票爲一種營業、在報紙登載廣吿、本報主張應由發行銀行登報公吿一律通用、並函銀錢業兩公會通函各行莊一律收受、方爲正辦、屢詳前報、茲探悉上海市銀行業同業公會昨日分函各會員銀行略云、「准中国農民銀行函請該行發行之杭州·西安·福州·蘭州等地名鈔票、及湖北省銀行改印之鈔票、均作無地名券、不論數目大小、隨時均可向該行掉換法幣、希望全市各會員銀行一律收受以利流通」云云、各銀行經公會通函後均已收用、如中交兩行亦能照農行辦法、則本市外埠地名鈔票之流通、可無問題矣、（M）</p>
<h3>撥款單止付問題　某銀行家之所見</h3>
<p>最近上海金融界發生交換銀行支票止付轇葛事件、事緣有勝記於六月廿九日、以浙江興業銀行存戶美光公司所出支票、計即期國幣七萬元、向該行取軟、當由該行付給同數即期五〇九九八一號撥款單一紙、於同月三十日委託銀行轉向銀行業聯合凖備會收帳、詎浙江興業銀行關照止付、勝記遂以撥款單爲銀行所出、流轉市上、視同現款、自通用以來、未聞出票銀行有擅自止付情事、向浙江興業銀行質問、浙江興業銀行之答復見於報紙者則謂「本行關於美光染織廠開去第五〇九九八一號撥款單止付事、業於七月七日上三日先後明白答覆在案一、此事關係票據信用、有詢之於某銀行家、據云、「關於浙江興業銀行止付支票一事、鄙人僅見報載、未明其事理之究爲如何、此係彼雙方事、但就票據言、撥款單爲各銀行支銀行業聯合準備會之支票、等於銀行本票、係一種無條件之支付證劵、爲銀錢業間互相淸算之票據、本市現已普遍流通、碾轉授受、頗得社會之歡迎信任、又本市銀行業規之規定、「本票掛失止付、限於水火盜賊或中途遺失等、」此事旣已引起各界注意、且與各銀行不無多少關係、想不久總有事實揭曉、藉明止付之眞相也、」（N）</p>
<h3>貼現起伏已平</h3>
<p>昨日匯劃票據貼現率、起落範圍已小、每千元上午初稍昂達二百元關口、將近午刻、始見回低至一百九十五元、下午更平、呆站一百九十五元、與上週六最後價相同、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍懸二角未更云、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債閃爍　外股行市見新高價　北寗路債本息照付</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨市閃爍不定、人心仍稍恍惚、依報載消息、英美艦隊擬開遠東、封鎖日本、則市價當漲、且有救國公債利息仍付法幣之說、政府維持公債之堅決、於此可見、英美法維持法幣及貸款消息、仍不斷傳來、故市先頗有上漲之象、惟以浮多及特種關係而賣出者仍極湧旺、乃復遭挫折、照趨勢言、連跌三日已小到三元之譜、前途亦當回好矣、咋日初開十一號及三十五號買進而漲、丙種高至二元外、繼以三十八號奮勇賣出、爲數甚夥、稍有轉機、又遭意外四十九號及、永康復又大數賣出、市價乃愈不支、買進方面、天生先進後出、十一號及三十五號冉乘低吸收、鼎康益中亦有相當收買、散戶亦出多進少、結果又小一角牟至七角、成交總數共計的八十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、呌價多而成功少、結果雖相近而未有交割、</p>
<p>衆業公所報吿、因外匯再見緊縮、橡皮股市異常堅挺、大多股票價格、見新高峯、賣戶以目下價格、若外滙續趨緊縮、似可不斷上升、故皆縮手停售、實業股平靜而帶疲、</p>
<p>倫敦航快特訊　一八九九年關內外鐵路公債、即俗稱北寗鐵路五厘公債、第三十五决還本抽籤、業於本年六月間舉行、計應還本金英金五萬七千五百鎊、又第八十期息票、計應付利息英金八千六百二十五鎊、兩共英金六萬六千一百二十五鎊、同於本月一日到期、已由倫敦匯豐銀行通吿開付云、</p>
<h3>中國國貨公司　增資二十萬元</h3>
<p>中國國貨公司、前日經股東臨時會議決、增加新資本國幣二十萬元、連原有資本國幣四十萬元、合成國幣六十萬元、除由該公司長沙分店盈餘項下撥付五萬元、平均攤給老股東外、不足之數、由老股東按老股二股、担認新股一股之比例、分担補足、自即日至九月三十日截止云、</p>
<h3>糧食　造成今日之米市　究是何方之責任　讀者自能明辨之　距解決之期想當不遠</h3>
<p>杜來自米號同業勸吿同業依限交易、切勿私作暗盤後、昨又在市塲公吿云、工部局本限價粳米二十元、秈米十六元、而茲暗盤已成公開秘密、依限則無從購貨、越盤則屬違法、處境困難、各同業是當遵守限價爲善等語、故昨米市又在停頓狀態中、所做開者僅二十一元之黎里冬霜、二十四元半之本糯、及二十三元洋糯、十六元之砶尖、十六元之底脚米而已、上海存米究屬如何、未能知之、惟存貨之在限價前收進者其數量必甚鉅、則以二十元之限盤粳米、及十六元之尖米、在門市出售、盡堪應付、故工部局所規定之限價、確有根據、而大廠號所感覺困難者爲未能滿其所慾耳</p>
<p>小米店則營業大爲困難矣、蓋自租界人口由疏而密、食用各品由賤而貴、米店亦隨人口激增市塵發達而勃興、但近來生意頗不易做、以其資本旣薄、平時門市應酬、無非轉輾受授、隨出隨進、店中所備者、多不過六七十石、祗可應付十天八天、際此環境、照限則無從購貨、亦即無貨應市、讓主顧他去、關門大吉、茲欲維持自己生計、紙有在塲外暗盤進貨之一法、如此則負担風險、故大小同業之間雖同在限價之下、亦是苦樂不勻、</p>
<p>米行家則大說官話、以為居間買賣、只收佣金、手中存貨、大都售脫、現有棧貨、屬於一般業外囤戶所執有、推得乾乾凈凈、生意不能做、只可停手、故連日市塲上頓形廖落、</p>
<p>客戶方面、亦有其說、以爲專事搬運而維生計、身本旣合、即可脫手、囤積居奇、祗有一般大資本家實力充足者方能做得、區區微本、不能久守、在不得已時、雖虧本亦只甩脫、即如目下南帮貨、內地出白市面爲十九元（有謂十八元）加上水脚捐費雜佣二元三角、則到滬身本爲二十一元三角、再加佣金須售二十一元半、而茲限價二十元、則如何脫手、是一以不得已均不出樣、暫爲守候、如至無可守候、亦只有出售耳、</p>
<p>米價之漲、由於囤戶力量之雄厚、愈貴愈不肯售而其所以力量雄厚、正爲金融界支持之也、金融界對於囤米押款、聞可得到八折之數、因之一付本錢、幾付運用、米糧之囤積不已、米價亦不易鬆動、故大衆吃的貴米、間接還是受金融業之賜、</p>
<p>未來趨勢似乎有寬鬆之象、即如昨日各路米到者、計有松江及南港早晚稻二十六號車輪包子楓涇貨一千餘包、未出樣、且聞蕪湖已實行開禁、首批貨已在裝運出境、計說有五千餘包、若此訊屬實、則混沌市面當有澄淸入正軌之希望、而滬民食得以無恐、且各區出新愈近、若蕪湖早尖、據說倘天時晴正、當可於旬日後出新、浦東新以來途阻碍、致祗首批抵埠後無繼來、然决難長此擯寺也、</p>
<p>客秈昨市正式交易依然不多、因機秈米與高砶均在十六元限價之上、故市上點綴、仍係中次砶米宿機米及糙米等、推午後傳蕪湖開禁有一週內現實之說、故午後客囤售意略鬆、成交總計的近二千包、</p>
<p>洋米貨方擯守不出、市面沉寂異常、但傳米商已向租界當局建議訂購接濟、滬市平沽、但此所關於民食前途者固有利亦有害、蓋以現在四辦士進關之匯價、洋米原價無論如何低廉、合之法幣之價、必昂貴異常、於是米商抬價、必振振有辭、以爲洋米尙且如此貴、杜米之貴、便爲名分、則居民米蒙平沽之實惠、先受抬價之暗苦、此則於定購之際、亦須作一番檢討也、</p>
<h3>粉麥再度上升</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨二號粉廠盤又漲二角、已達五元五角現鈔之價、各廠以小麥原料一再昂騰、存粉亦不多、除供給本街零批交易外、對於客帮大量去化仍予限制、成交總額不多、本客併計的四五萬包、聞回籠貨亦隨廠盤同時提高、行國與客戶均思覓取、而市上浮存已枯、市面堅俏異常、麵粉今日有二萬包、運往塘沽、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日麥市漲風更烈、近因常錫等處、產價飛漲、而廠方以洋麥定價久已不通、對於本麥需要日見濃厚、囤戶亦屬貪取、貨方趁此扳持、且金市飛升、人心奇昂、市面竟空前猛漲、統市售開常錫京鎭丹及管店等麥共達三十八車之多、計由福新廠辦去廿二車、阜豐六車、囤戶十餘車、最高價七元八角、又七元五角至二角、漲四五六角、又糧食類之豆子、今日有四百八十包、運往塘沽、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗漲風可畏　特金城已到七百元</h3>
<p>紗市續升、漲風仍强、蓋以華南香港帮採辦獨健、人心挺秀、內地帮對於華紗久已停頓而不辦、近以冷門貨價格較廉、且有現貨可得、二十支醒獅五子等紗銷路活躍、售價因此提升一步、至於熱門紗、二十支特金城漲風之猛、使人驚愕、己到七百元之高價、二十支雙馬已達六百二十元、此種漲勢之厲、誠不知伊於胡底也、</p>
<p>現紗展開甚平、二十支雙馬外棧價為六百零四元、棧單價爲五百九十一元、與上日不相上下、少頃市塲忽見緊張、買風驟起、謂外滙又微縮、黃金稍昂、紗市乃一霎間跳起十餘元、二十支雙馬外棧價續高至六百二十元、棧單五百九十八元、查半日成交一千零七十五包、上日成交一百六十包、行情二十支雙馬漲十七元、特金城漲二十五元、牧羊漲二元、各帮買額列左、</p>
<p>香港　五四〇　寗波　四〇</p>
<p>溫州　二〇　雲南　一〇</p>
<p>內地　九〇　同行　三七五</p>
<p>統計　一、〇七五</p>
<p>日紗開盤趨漲、二十支月琴本月份價為四百七十七兀、一刻而忽跌五元、繼以本紗大漲、亦被牽入佳境、回至四百八十元、收盤價爲四百七十八元左右、惟實需平平、囤戶校夥、</p>
<h3>同業手貨將罄　印棉再漲三四元</h3>
<p>本棉交易杜絕、實則廠方皆有納胃、無奈存貨潰乏、以致成交難能可貴也、惟日廠對印棉搜羅殷切、採辦殊巨、一說、係裝運靑島、故近日同業之手貨、大都被其掃數吃光、因其售價較洋行方面之行盤要廉宜二十元之巨、比較大爲便宜、紛紛購買不絕、成交稍减、因各號存貨大都賣罄、行情再漲三四元之譜、蘇北來源、計通州花三百五十包、茲將現棉之盤錄左、</p>
<p>克來納　二九·〇　同業　五〇〇件</p>
<p>來貢花　二三·〇　同業　二〇〇件</p>
<p>惠同登　一二六·五　同業　二〇〇件</p>
<p>次彭家浦　一二四·五　同業　二〇〇件</p>
<p>白洛去　二一〇·〇　同業　二〇〇件</p>
<p>印棉又有運來、大英公司貨輸Somali號、此次由倫教來滬、經遠孟買時、裝來棉花一千二百件、該輪今日可抵滬、停靠浦東其昌西棧起卸、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、昨日因滙兌又吿緊縮、棉花本市存底日薄、因之售價猛漲、然同業間交易反見熱鬧、平果兒已出現百元外之新高價、木市存棉幾將全被日廠所吸購、現貨與期貨之售價、日相接近、一旦各同業之手貨售罄後、又將向洋行方面訂購、故預料外棉離向榮之日已不遠矣、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日殊為靜寂、開盤時售價未見更動、後因一部份多頭獲利了結、小二三磅音、惟大部同業咸抱觀望態度、均擬等待政府之棉產估計發表後再決定營業方針也故收盤價格異常平靜、漲跌一二磅音、印度連同預測跌二五羅比、埃及停市、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋白貨勝漲過暴　市塲停止期貨交易　華廠色布價格混亂　匯兌緊縮輸出倍增</h3>
<p>國布　晨開略堅、白貨細布·細斜每疋漲起二角、本街批發號　頗有乘廉辦進之意、粵·帮亦續辦色斜、午後英匯在四辦士內、囤戶活動、布價提漲、細布·細斜每疋再漲二三角、粗布粗斜重磅漲五角、輕磅漲二角之譜、色布價格混亂、尚乏確市、本街成交細布·細斜·綫呢·嗶嘰·絨布等貨四五百件、粤帮進色斜一百餘箱、條子絨布綫呢嗶嘰二千餘疋甬帮水不色斜·漂布·藍布五六十箱、國外香港·新加坡·暹遲以匯兌關係、有利輸出、近去貨倍增、昨續辦細斜·漂布·漂斜·紅洋標等貨四千餘疋、</p>
<p>東疋　白貨新高峯層出不窮、昨十二磅龍　頭細布下月期貨、伊籐行售開為每疋十八元、東棉行開本月份三桃細布每疋價十六元五角、兩共訂二出百餘件、市上現貨籌碼細布允感匱乏、故成交不旺、龍頭現出爲十七元五角、木月份十七元七角半、較上週續漲五角、白貨市塲鑒於升漲過暴、爲防止未來危險起見、昨特吿同業、自即日起停止期貨新交易、祗准買賣現貨、其以前所做之期貨、並應由買賣雙方自行交割了結等語、故昨市塲投機心思之皮球交易、頓形歛跡、</p>

<h3>關窗哲學</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>近來寫女章的範圍似乎愈來愈狹了。心也沉重，筆也沉重。在道種環境下雖然絕無悲觀失望的道理，但不再有輕快的心情恐怕也許是事實。對於重視物質享樂甚於精神生活的人，那麼只耍他身邊還有錢，沒有過「橋北」的必要，他還不至於痛感目前生活的黑暗－物價高漲對於有錢人是不會發生甚麼影響的。美女牌冰洪淋再漲價一些，也決不至發生「搶冰」的風潮。總之，對於開門七件事不發生直接關係的人，根本不在我們所欲考慮範圍以內。這輩人也許也有精神生活，但大概跳不出舞塲游泳池一類的圈子。</p>
<p>目前留在上海最感痛苦的一輩人，是一輩喫飯雖已艱難却還要求一些精神糧食的人。在有一個時期，這輩人就是所謂小布爾喬亞，小布爾喬亞雖說是沒有眞正的階級基礎，然而在每一個現代國家中，這輩人無疑是社會的中流砥柱，試察一下社會各方面的中心技術人員和組織領導份子，在在都是屬於這一階層的人物。因此對於這一輩人的生活現狀原是每一個關心社會問題的人所應該注意的。</p>
<p>對於這輩人，據我個人的觀察，物質生活固有一定程度的重要性但精神生活及於他們的影響，遠甚於物質生活的。相傳蘇聯革命時最獲得普遍接愛的口號是「土地，麵包與自由」。如果以土地代表農民的要求，麵包代表工人的，那麼自由就是表現了小資產階級者的精神要求。</p>
<p>我們今天心上所以感到重壓，這原因恐怕正唯因爲我們正在失却目由中。黑暗氣氛的日益緊迫，已使我們感到呼吸的窒息。可是使我們最痛苦的是在這樣的情形下竟還有一輩自以爲「明哲」的人在自動關上僅有的幾個窗戶！</p>
<p>對於「明哲保身」這古訓，僅作機會主義的解釋，就等於苟延殘喘，決不能保得狗命以外的甚麼身！</p>
<p>我們不必作超過客觀條件過高的要求，但把「環境論」來作繭自縛，實是至愚透頂的戰略。</p>
<p>「不自由，毋寗死！」這話現在我們該牢牢記住不，應該付之實踐、特別是每個站在精神生活領域工作的人。</p>
<p>別人築牆，我們拆屋，別人要求封門，我們應以打開大窗來答覆，決不是關閉窗戶！技術是一個問題，但絕不要忘了原則。</p>
<h3>德國勞動集中營（上）</h3>
<p>— 謀周譯</p>
<p>三年前，我也是一個被罰到沼地去做苦工的犯人。剛在兩三星期之前，我的朋友方纔離開了延姆斯河沼地（EmsRiverMarshland）上的勞動集中營（德國國社黨執政後所特設的一種監獄，獄裏所拘留的犯人，大抵是政治犯－譯者）。當他叙述他的經歷時，意斯托惠近（Esterwege）與紐薩斯德浪（Neusustrum）的荒野重新出現在我的面前。</p>
<p>將近一九三六年的年底，消息漏進了悔過所裏，說有成批的犯人叉要被押送到沼地去。沒有一個人願意去。因之，有幾個犯人將不能消除的黑鉛的溶液滴入自已的眼睛裏，想引起發炎或者甚至失明。有的用一枚針將污穢的紗綫穿過自己的手心，想惹起血毒。他們情願趁早失明，或是被送進醫院裹，却不肯到沼地去。</p>
<p>那些「政治犯」是很狷傲的，他們不願採取這種消極的手段。我在悔過所裹度過了三年，在政治犯中間，我沒有聽到他們發生過一决自戕。</p>
<p>在一九三七年的四月十四日，悔過所當局召集了所裏的犯人，而將一百個犯人－其中三分之二是政治犯－押到火車站去。到了第二天的早晨，經過了十八個小時的駛行，火車開到了道森（Doersen）車站。在月台上，勞動集中營裏的看守者以裝就的刺刀恭候着他們的犯人。過去一些，停着「沼地專車」－銜接各個勞動集中營的專車。車門一開，看守者早已抓好了犯人，把槍柄痛打着他們說：「豬玀！烏龜！到貨車上去！」</p>
<p>到了一九三七年，沼地早已鋪好了公路與永久鐵道。在一九三五年的三月裹，常我跨上「沼地專車」的時候，它還載着我經過了沒有路徑的潮濕的荒野。然而，對付犯人的牛馬似的待遇，仍舊沒有變改。</p>
<p>忽然有一陣大風吹過沼地，天下起雨來。在兩三分鐘中，犯人的全身濕透了。突然間，一聲粗暴的命令響到了空中：「跪下！那些仍舊站着的，就要被槍決了。」這是指揮者惠利·勃脫萊（Willi　Bertram）的聲音。車上幾乎連立足的地方都沒有，更不要說起跪下了。犯人幾乎還沒有弄淸楚自己應做的事情，當時，子彈早已在他們的頭上呼嘯了。</p>
<p>火車停在離營兩三碼路的地方。在向營裹去的路上，全是架就機關槍的瞭望台和電網。「整隊！成二行！」看守者在犯人的旁邊奔走着，並且以槍柄牴觸着他們。</p>
<p>犯人到了營裏的天井中，看守者的面上現出了暴虐狂者的忻喜。兩個副官－奧格司脫。狄克米爾（AugustDicKmeier）和海爾末斯－米爾（Helmuth－Meier）總管着這些犯人。他們排成了隊伍，並且各人得到了一個號數與一個營舍裏的號數。這一件事就化了三個小時。談話是嚴禁的，跑開隊伍也是被禁止的。有一個犯人，忍耐不住了，就略爲站開些。海爾末斯。米爾就抓住他，用爾點似的拳打脚踢把他打了一陣：然後叫他推了一部裝着黃沙的小車繞着營舍奔跑，一直到他力竭身死爲止。</p>
<p>那個登記犯人履歷的長官，是一個面團團的吃得胖胖的怪人。我的朋友的决序挨到了。「你爲什麼到這裏來的？」他受到這樣的詢問。看守者　銳地注視着他的嘴唇。「爲了政……」在他能够說完之前，他的面孔上早已受到了重重的一拳。所有的政治犯都受到這一種同樣的待遇。刑事犯却是被赦免的。</p>
<p>經過了幾小時之後，登記手續總算吿了一個結束。犯人被趕到營舍裹。他們一到自己的宿舍，警笛就響了：——「到天井裹去聽候點名！」這樣重複了好幾遍。等到五點三十分，食物端出來了，而犯人却被吩咐到床上去。</p>
<p>即使如此，心想挫折犯人勇氣的「歡迎典禮還沒有結束。在半夜裹，宿舍裏可以聽到皮靴的格格之聲。接着一陣酗酒老的咆哮：「猪玀，你們決不會活着離開這裏。我們會槍斃你們，而把你們的屍體作爲沼地的肥料。」被恐驚住了的犯人，在床上守着絨默。「你們這班小胆鬼，」含着酒意的聲音繼續道，一現在，你們是菜色的，你們已經失去了你們的血管神經了！」隨後，看守者就拿起馬鞭來笞打犯人。</p>
<p>在早晨，犯人在四點三十分就被驚醒了。在進早餐之前，副官進來查床鋪。草褥一定要鋪得成長方形的，像雪茄　盒子的長方形一般。那些床　不能滿足看守者的審美觀　的犯人，就要遭到晦氣。一到六點鐘，工作就開始了。</p>
<h3>重蹈覆轍</h3>
<p>— （譯字林報）</p>
<h3>談牛</h3>
<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>家牛和野牛</p>
<p>葉楚傖先生在好幾年以前寫了一篇東西，題目是「牛的覺悟」，於今還收在正中國文敎本裏做敎材，文章很長，大意是說蘇州農夫袁老福家裏的耕牛，因被虐待，的了鐮刀，犂耙，耜頭，泥抓等一齊同盟罷工，牛做盟主，結果鐮刀等田具反被老福利用了對付耕牛，耕牛自己也挨不了飢餓終於屈服了，牛自己有一篇偉大的演說，歸咎自己這一夥，第一沒有共同生活的救濟，第二，沒有犧牲的决心，第三沒有意識完全的組織，所以結巢只有失敗了。</p>
<p>這失敗的悲哀，是家牛們必然的收塲，因爲牠要吃人家餵給牠的草料。葉先生所指出的共同生活的救濟，談何容易，不要說是牛，連號稱萬物之靈的人也沒有做到，不是麼？至於犧牲的决心，和意識完全的組織，更難乎其難，如果克服了這三點困難，我想，今日早已是牛做世界主人的時代，執牛耳的，不是人，而是牛自已了。</p>
<p>牛是和人站在對立的地位的，牠如果能從人的家中衝出去，不戀戀於人們給牠的草料，回復到野牛生活的時代，牠必然的會得着勝利了。</p>
<p>偶見申報副刊「科學與人生」欄中有禾山君所作「科學聊齋」三則，其第三則云：「達爾文亦言野牛（Bison）能互助禦侮，每遇狼之見侵，輒將其幼子置於羣之中央，老牛皆以首常其衝，作怒視狀，且以首之角，堪作抗敵之武器，列戟森森，狼畏其强，知近逼必無幸焉，雖急欲進攻，逡巡趦趄，而卒不得逞。」</p>
<p>野牛是有犧牲的决心的，否則，牠們必不敢與狼爲敵；野牛是有意識完全的組織的，「首當其衝」，「列戟森森」，不是組織完全的表現嗎？野牛也有共同生活的救濟的，牠們養衛了自己還要能保護牠們的後一代，置幼子於中央，不讓幼子被敵人據去。這，不但家牛對之有愧色，我們做人的，也不免對之有愧色了吧？</p>
<p>鞭牛背和燒牛尾</p>
<p>發命令指示牛的是大，牛應該做苦工，人也應該做苦工，人如果只是鞭牛去做工，而自己不肯吃苦，那是不行的。牛疲憊了該鞭打，人疲憊了不鞭打，那就不公平了。</p>
<p>東質臯雜錄上載了一段極有意義的話：</p>
<p>斐休與黃　爲忘年友，一日，同行宛水上，見有駕柴車過隄下，泥深，牛憊，鞭之不巳。休方止其鞭者，葉遽曰：『不可不重打，兩脚時勸不得四脚時，不肯行也好打。』</p>
<p>這裏，兩脚指的是人，四脚指的是牛，四脚牛憊了該重打，兩脚人憊了「不肯行」，若不用鞭子去打，就要永遠憊了下去，因爲人比牛懶得多了。不信，你看痛鞭牛背的人們高高坐在柴車上，他們路都不肯走，因爲怕隄下泥深不好走，更要把自已的體重加在牛的身上，他們還背替牛分點柴草背背，减輕牛的擔負嗎？</p>
<p>這件事，據裴黃二公所見所談，並沒有吿訴我們的結果如何，柴車是吾脫了泥淖的深陷？渡過了難關沒有呢？</p>
<p>我以爲，駕車的人，除自己分取一部份重量來背背而外，牛如果還疲憊不肯前進的話，那只有用火燒一下牛的尾巴，（用爲鞭打已不奏效了。）仿效田單火牛陣的故事，牛的尾巴被燒急了，牠必定一跳一衝，就奔出了泥的深陷了。</p>
<p>不過牛是未必肯停在泥淖裏不肯前進的，燒尾巴是最後一着，不得巳而爲之。假如田單不被圍在即墨城中無法自救時，也必不肯隨便擺火牛陣的吧。</p>
<p>最要緊的，是鞭打架柴車的那個人，『兩脚時勸不得四脚時，不肯行也好打』，到底是一句名言。</p>

<h3>關於演員的三四事</h3>
<h3>龔稼農</h3>
<p>編者介紹：　稼農是明星公司的一員宿將，演技洗練老到，為其唯一特長。他所演過的片子，在過十餘年間，殆佔明星全部出品半數以上，對於演戲經驗、可說是富極了。本文就演員本位立論，見解極形高超，也正是每個演員應有的認識。</p>
<p>自從致力電影以來，不覺已有十多年了。就過去經驗站在演員立場說來，我以為對於演員的觀念，應看為是有他一定的創造的，有生命的藝人，不應當看他只是導演人的一種單純而機械的工具；因為演員的表演不僅只是導演人藉以達到他的目的之手段，實在，它的本身（表演），還是一種創造的活的藝術。</p>
<p>演員不單是在藝術上的對編劇者及導演者服務，同時和編劇者及導演者一樣對社會服務，而且演員也同他們一樣對於社會應有正確的認識，這廖識的深淺正與他的藝術的成就之高低成正比例。</p>
<p>演員應當有著正確的社會認識作為基礎，那末才可以在他全部表演生活中，在他對社會的服務中，能充分發揮出他的演技。因為，一劇中的人物，無論是重要或不重要，他的思想，情感，行動以及各種習慣，都是直接或間接地由他所處的社會生活中決定出來的，若不這樣了解，演員只是對他自己的表演，頂高不過是一種庸俗的，膚淺的，無生命的摹仿，甚至有時還會弄得完全不是那麼一回事，所以對於社會的認識是決定那人物的了解，也是決定那人物的表現的。</p>
<p>不僅應當這樣—演員能充分了解他所擔任的一角。並且，他還更當對於一劇的主題及共同完成那主題的其他部份完全明白，也就是說他應把全劇研究，而得到完滿，整個的了解。</p>
<p>至於那些只讓演員知道他的一角，甚至只讓演員分散地了解某一場面，這在作為社會的藝人的演員是不允許的，因為有這多種的不利之情形：</p>
<p>（一）消滅演員之創造的具體的表演—一個演員是與全劇有農密切關係的。若一個演員在一劇中不明白他與其他演員的關係，在一幕中不明白一場與一場的關係及效果，也就是不明白全劇的主題及發展，那末這個演員連無生命的，摹仿的，庸俗的很難演好，還有甚麼創造的表現？</p>
<p>（二）破壞全劇的整個效果—若一個演員只知道他的一角或只了解某一場，那會影響到別的演員，而結果使全劇鬆懈，因為演員的表演及效果是相連於其他演員的表演及效果的。</p>
<p>（三）消滅演員的個性—若一個演員不能充分了解全劇，因而不能了解他的所演的角色，而致其無法對他的角色作創造的具體的表現，同時就會使他在他的表演中不能充分適當的發展他的個性，甚至使他的個性消滅。</p>
<p>（四）使演員對於他所擔任之角色不能充分了解—一個演員飾演著劇中某一人物，是與其他各部份演員協力合作表演的，且演員的表演或人物的表現對於全劇有密切的關係的，若這演員對於全劇不過部或不了解，那末一定不能充分了解他所擔任之角色。</p>
<p>所以，一劇的成功，演員對於全劇能充分深刻的了解是必要條件，而這對全劇充分了解及能刻劃出某一人物的個性，是以他對於他所處社會的深刻認識為基礎的。</p>
<p>在現時及將來的電影和戲劇中，能把握著一定的社會意識和情感的演員，也就不是導演人的單純機械的工具而有其固有創造性的演員，是最需要的，也只有這樣的演員能各其他人員共同推進電影藝術與戲劇藝術。</p>
<p>這是我於演員工作在平時觀察下的一些極淺薄的愚見。</p>
<h3>楊寳森來滬前奏</h3>
<p>— 愛萍室主</p>
<p>溽暑漸消，海上劇戲院又將重振旗鼓矣。黃金大戲院向以平角為號召，茲秋涼開幕　首選者，早經邀妥故都戲校高材生花旦宋德珠及余派名龍鬚生楊賓森二人。此二人中，楊時出演滬濱，其藝術為本市各界各熟知，而宋則係初次蒞滬，盡亦藝壇一新人物也。</p>
<p>關於德珠一切，余於上月初嘗文記之本報，不贅述。茲所欲言者，好寳森也。</p>
<p>寳森為皖北人，也故名花旦楊桂雲（寳仙）之孫也，本年三十有一歲，待人接物，和藹可親，一無伶人習氣，其藝得自名教師陳秀華傳授，寳齡時即有聲於時，唱做宗法叔岩，頗得個中三昧，叔岩本人嘗許為傳人。能劇頗夥。尤以「空城計」「寳臣宴」「捉放曹」「珠簾寨」「南陽關」「烏龍院」諸劇最為膾炙人口，而為人所稱道。</p>
<p>寳森唱做即宗法叔岩，以是演出各劇，皆力守繩墨，絲毫不趨時髦，造詣工力之深，有目共賞，以是小翠花，章遏雲，毛世來諸伶皆樂與之合作，俾收牡丹綠葉之效也。</p>
<p>寳森登臺演劇，其優點非三言兩語所能盡其百一，略言之，其態度可得「沉靜神閑」四字之評，自始至終，不稍變易，念白無富英之鬆懈，做派亦較富英純正自然，扮相　有書卷氣息，求之一般鬚生中，實有多觀也。</p>
<p>寳森前因困於嗜好，聲譽有不如前之勢，及後力自振作，摒除一切有害身心之物，與小翠花一演而恢復舊時隆譽。最近一次與遏雲合作出演，較前更見進步，其聲譽將有突過從前之勢，在滬貼重頭戲「四郎探母」數次，吊毛，水髮，嘎調，俱極精彩，精神之飽滿，嗓音之清潤，聆者莫不擊節歎賞，此次德珠南來，寳森又偕之俱至，同豪出演，當更較前尤佳，可以預卜。</p>
<h3>「夜上海」中的梅蕚輝</h3>
<p>— （柏李）</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>倘使遇見好說話的老闆，也就俯允了角兒的要求，短期內似乎相安無事。詎奈人之慾望難填，未過幾日，角兒又要加銀啦，縱令園主再好講話，此時也忍不住了，結果必至雙方感情破裂。還有一種又臭又硬，　不講理的園主，不論多紅的角兒替他賺進多少錢來，然而要提起長包銀的話，那算白說，你使軟的，他有軟的手腕，你用硬的，他有硬的方法，俗雲「強龍不壓地土蛇，」外路的角色相領再好，但是很難鬥得過他們的，因此彼此的感情，也不能常相融洽的。</p>
<p>依據以上所說的兩種原因，可知角兒一在某處唱得久啦，就與園主方面發生裂痕，恨不能早日脫離此地另搭新班。要是適巧有人來邀，這正所謂是求之不得的快心之舉，那總比自投班子塔好得多了。勾角人皆係戲班裏的老手，對於角兒的這種心理，早已揣知，他一連看過幾天戲，無形中又與某角會面很熟，據內行人傳說凡勾角的人都有一種暗號，同時常在外面跑江湖的角兒，也全能了解這些手勢，雙方既已心照不宣，等到戲一打住，角兒就吩咐他的夥計，暗隨在勾角人的身後，一到寓處，就可　所欲言了。經過數度接談之後，將條件議妥。遂即交付定銀，籌劃私奔的方法，好在並無攜帶行頭的麻煩，祇於事前把我上面所說的那幾件應用的東西，打在一個小包袱裏，（至於武生應手的刀槍把子，只好犧牲了。）</p>
<h3>嬌妻膩友</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>「嬌妻膩友」和「左擁右抱」（Wife，Doctor　and　Nurse）是同型的喜劇，主演人華納裴士德和洛麗泰楊也是老「班底」，不過看護薇姬妮勃魯斯現在換了琵妮龐絲的膩友了。</p>
<p>好萊塢男女明星的桃色新聞，時常鬧得滿城風雨，一本電影雜志遠渡太平洋寄到上海的時候，有些如火如荼的記載，事實上已是歷史上的陳　了。所以，如「嬌妻膩友」這樣的劇本，在客觀效果上，至少反映了他們變愛生活的一般。</p>
<p>導演者的手腕是值得我們學習的，如上週開映的「梅花三弄」一樣，每一個人物，每一場戲，都能明顯地刻劃著他們的性格，和處理得活潑動人，使銀幕下的歡觀眾，沒有一刻不是發著不由自主的笑聲。</p>
<p>華納裴士德是個建築師，他厭惡妻子的歌唱；洛麗泰楊她不知自己歌喉並不聽動，而無時無刻發著怪聲；導演者把這一對不調和的夫婦是寫得非常有趣的。即是圍在他們四週的人物，如洛麗泰楊的父母，歌唱教師等，也都能寫得非常細膩週到。</p>
<p>全片精彩的場面很多。如華納裴士德初遇　妮龐絲，琵怩龐絲發現他的歌喉，勸他練習歌唱；華納裴士德表演歸來，趕到妻子的病榻畔，他們的軟語，他們的擁抱，都是動人之至。而最後華納裴德因洛麗泰楊出走之後，中心慌亂，登臺時茫然不知所措，因之笑話百出，全場騷然，洛麗泰楊適也在觀劇，急急趕到後臺，夫婦言歸於好，這場戲雖然一貫地給予我們許多笑料，但是華納裴士德的沉痛，依然在笑聲背面透露出來，感動人心。</p>
<p>演員中，華納裴士德是演得了好的一個，為歌聲所擾時的焦躁，初次登臺時的窘態，妻子出走後的痛苦，在後臺的懺悔，都能在面部表情上清楚地分析著。洛麗泰楊的嬌憨，及　妮龐絲的媚態，也都可愛</p>
<h3>最後消息</h3>
<p>前天「夜上海」獻演，遠在重慶的曹禺特電託友人送花藍一隻，為作者於伶慶賀，並為璇宮劇院的開幕禮物。</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Between Tongbai and Dahong Mountains Surround Japanese Forces from the North and South; Japanese Troops in Southeastern Shanxi Flee to Wenxi, Anyi, and Yuncheng; Zhongshan Authorities Order Coastal Defense Forces to Be on Alert Against Further Japanese Incursions; Japanese Train Near Jianshanpu Destroyed</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to recent telegrams received here, Chinese artillery units are active again in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. At around 10:55 AM on August 1st, Chinese artillery in a certain location in Anhui Province bombarded a large Japanese transport ship, scoring nine direct hits and causing significant damage. In northern Hubei, Japanese troops in Qian County and Sui County, aided by mechanized units and aircraft, launched an offensive northwestward, fiercely attacking Chinese positions at Lishan. Intense bombing by Japanese aircraft and artillery forced Chinese troops to abandon their positions at Lishan at noon on August 5th. Chinese troops operating along the southern ridge of the Tongbai Mountains have recaptured Tianhekou and are now advancing southward, hoping to strike the northern flank of the Japanese troops moving west from Lishan. Meanwhile, Chinese forces in the Tongbai and Dahong Mountains are currently surrounding Japanese troops from both the north and south. The fighting in southeastern Shanxi is now concentrated around Jincheng. After the Japanese troops were routed to the east, they are now retreating towards the Tongpu Railway in the direction of Wenxi, Xiaxian, Anyi, and Yuncheng. Chinese troops are currently surrounding Xiaxian, and Jincheng is also under siege. On the afternoon of August 1st, a portion of the Japanese troops in the city, with the assistance of four field guns and eight tanks, broke through Chinese lines to the south and fled along the highway towards Bo'ai, the western end of the Daoqing Railway. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) This morning, over thirty artillery rounds were heard in the northwestern corner of Zhongshan, fired by Japanese troops in Jiangmen to deter a Chinese counteroffensive. There are six or seven Japanese shallow-water vessels and thirty or forty rubber boats and armed fishing boats along the Beijie River. To prevent further Japanese incursions, Zhongshan authorities have ordered coastal defense forces to be on alert. (Special Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>In the past three days, Chinese troops in Miluo encountered a large Japanese battalion dispatched to Taolin for reinforcements in the area north of Dayun Mountain and south of Yangqiaolou Sizaoli. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the entire Japanese force was annihilated by the morning of the 6th. The Japanese left behind over three hundred corpses in the area, and Chinese troops seized dozens of machine guns and rifles, and over a hundred mountain artillery shells. In addition, another Chinese unit ambushed and destroyed a Japanese train near Jianshanpu, near Linxiang, on the evening of the 2nd. (Telegraph, 7th)</p>

<h3>Fei Wusheng Personally Witnesses the New Dalai Lama's Journey to Tibet</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Mr. Fei Wusheng, the former secretary of the Shanghai YMCA, personally witnessed the journey of the new Dalai Lama and his entourage to Lhasa. He is the only foreigner to have seen this. Fei arrived at the Kongbang Monastery (transliteration) in Qinghai Province half an hour before the Dalai Lama's arrival. However, due to haste, he loaded previously exposed film into the camera, missing the opportunity to take pictures. Fei saw sixteen aircraft at the Lanzhou airfield presented to the Chinese government by the people of Xinjiang Chinese Turkestan. It is said that the highway between Xining and Lanzhou will be completed within a month, reducing the journey between the two places from three days to one day, as this new road is a shortcut.

<h3>Details of British Ship Bombed in Yichang; British Officer Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>(Yichang) Eighteen Japanese aircraft bombed Yichang fiercely at around 6 AM on the 6th. Aside from the destruction of several civilian houses and the deaths and injuries of over eighty civilians, there were no other losses for the Chinese side. However, the British Jardine Matheson and Hsing Chang &amp; Co. ships were bombed and destroyed, injuring the British chief mate, Mr. Dania, and killing four Chinese crew members and injuring over twenty others. A bomb landed near the Taikoo Dockyard, causing the collapse of several sections of the wall. At around 11 AM, another ten Japanese aircraft infiltrated the city's airspace and bombed and destroyed the British Chia Ho ship, with no casualties. The British Asiatic Petroleum Company oil depot was heavily bombed, with three heavy bombs landing in the depot, destroying the oil storage room and warehouses, and injuring several workers. In addition, several incendiary bombs landed in a certain location, setting fire to over thirty houses and killing and injuring over seventy civilians. The Japanese aircraft exclusively targeted British expatriates and British commercial properties during this bombing raid, causing outrage among all foreign expatriates in Yichang, who are reportedly planning collective retaliation for this Japanese act of violence. Several reporters and expatriates, standing at the highest point outside the city, witnessed the Japanese aircraft dropping bombs in great detail. The Japanese aircraft initially dropped several bombs in the suburbs, then immediately changed formation and circled the expatriate district along the river, flying at low altitude and conducting reconnaissance for a long time, before concentrating on targeting the British warship HMS Gnat in the river and the Hsing Chang &amp; Co. ship of Jardine Matheson, aiming and dropping bombs. At the time, the fuselage was only a few feet away from the ship's bridge. After repeated bombing by the Japanese aircraft, flames suddenly erupted and a strange sound was heard, and the Hsing Chang &amp; Co. ship was destroyed. Many bombs were dropped into the river, and the HMS Gnat was severely shaken, but fortunately it was not hit. After the bombing, the Japanese aircraft circled the ship twice before flying away. The second wave of ten Japanese aircraft infiltrated the airspace above Yichang at around 11 AM, flying for two weeks. The Japanese aircraft changed formation in the same way as before and repeatedly bombed the Asiatic Petroleum Company oil depot and the Chia Ho ship of Jardine Matheson, which was moored nearby in the river. The Japanese aircraft first concentrated on dropping bombs into the Asiatic Petroleum Company oil depot, and amidst the raging fire and explosions, several aircraft flew low over the Chia Ho ship and began bombing. The ship was almost entirely destroyed, leaving only a few iron ribs. Both ships and the roof of the Asiatic Petroleum Company oil depot displayed large British flags, and the British coat of arms painted on the ships' hulls were clearly visible. When the Japanese aircraft circled over the river, they used machine guns to strafe all ships displaying British flags, so many British ships are riddled with bullet holes. Afterwards, reporters visited HMS Gnat Captain and Acting British Consul in Yichang, Mr. Oppan, to express their condolences. Captain Oppan spoke to reporters, and his account of the bombing of the two ships was entirely consistent with what the reporters had witnessed. Captain Oppan also expressed his deep sympathy for the suffering of the Chinese people. Captain Oppan immediately telegraphed the British Consul-General and the highest-ranking British naval officer, reporting the incident. Captain Oppan has now received replies from the two British officials, stating that they have lodged serious protests with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai and Hankou. (Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<p>London This morning, the British newspapers in London expressed extreme outrage at the bombing of two British ships in Yichang by Japanese aircraft. Both ships were moored in a safe area, but after one was hit and caught fire, the second suffered the same fate. In addition to injured British sailors, Chinese sailors were also injured. Rear Admiral Holder, the senior British naval officer stationed in Yichang, has lodged a protest with the Japanese naval authorities. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since the past week (July 30th to August 5th), the fighting in Henan Province has been relatively intense. Our troops, taking advantage of the enemy's exhaustion, launched separate attacks and achieved many victories. The other fronts saw only sporadic fighting. Our mobile attacks have forced the enemy to spread themselves thin and struggle to cope, exposing their increasingly dire straits. The progress of the fighting is summarized below:</p>
<p>Shanxi Front: The enemy invading southeastern Shanxi, after being severely attacked by our forces last week, lost their bearings. The majority of their main force retreated north along the Baijin Highway, while the remaining three to four thousand troops remained trapped in Changzhi, Huguan, Jincheng, and other locations, desperately defending their positions with fortifications. After days of careful planning, we first cleared out the remaining enemy around Gaoping and along the Hongtun Highway. From the morning of the 1st, we launched a two-pronged attack on Changzhi and Huguan. The enemy resisted stubbornly, resulting in fierce fighting throughout the day, with heavy casualties on both sides. By nightfall, our troops finally charged into the city trenches under heavy fire. The enemy in Changzhi retreated eastward without engaging in street fighting, and the county seat was declared retaken. In Huguan, our troops engaged the enemy in fierce street fighting, destroying all enemy fortifications, barracks, and warehouses before returning to their original defenses at dawn. The Chinese forces besieging Jincheng, after three days of bloody fighting, killed over six hundred enemy troops. The remaining enemy troops retreated in disarray to Huguan through mountain passes, attempting to attack Licheng. Our main force is closely monitoring the situation. In southern Shanxi, the enemy has launched several attacks from Hongtong and Wan'anzhen, but were met with fierce resistance and suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday, our troops launched a surprise attack on the enemy's rear, surrounding Wan'anzhen. The enemy fled north in a panic, and the town was declared retaken. We are now advancing towards Hongtong.</p>
<p>Henan-Hubei Front: Since last week, the enemy in southern Henan, in addition to sending a portion of their forces north to capture Minggang and Lixindian, divided their main force into two groups, advancing towards Zibai and Biyang. Maoji, Guxianzhen, Xiaolindian, Wanggang, Pingchangguan, and Huaihedian were successively captured. This week, our forces completed their deployments and launched a full-scale offensive, achieving successive victories. On the 1st, we retook Maoji and Guxianzhen. On the 2nd, we retook Xiaolindian, Pingchangguan, and Huaihedian. On the 3rd, we retook Minggang and Lixindian, and then advanced south, surrounding and fiercely attacking the Japanese troops at Changzhaoguan, inflicting heavy casualties. The enemy's plan to attack north was thwarted, and they then attempted to harass from the southern side of the Tongbai Mountains. The center of the fighting gradually shifted to northern Hubei. Currently, there are four to five thousand Japanese troops in the area north of Sui County, engaged in fierce fighting with our forces in the area of Tianhekou, Chashan, Bijia Mountain, Yinjia Dian, Qilitang, and Diaoyutai. The Japanese are also constantly transporting reinforcements and ammunition by truck to Sui County from Anlu and Xihe. On the 2nd, seven Chinese trucks ambushed and destroyed two Japanese trucks, killing many Japanese soldiers. On the 3rd, a portion of the Japanese troops attacked Gaocheng (north of Xihe) in three routes: one from Shimen, one from Wanjia Dian, and one from Qigumiao. At the same time, the Japanese troops at Wusheng Pass also sent teams to attack Gaocheng and Lishan to coordinate their efforts. After separate engagements, both sides are engaged in fierce fighting, which is gradually expanding. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Campbell Captures Panda, Approved for Transport to the United States</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A panda captured by Professor Campbell of the West China Union University in Chengdu was transported by plane from Chongqing to Hong Kong on the 5th, awaiting shipment to the St. Louis Zoo in the United States. The Chinese government recently issued an order prohibiting the export of pandas, but because Campbell's panda was captured before the order was issued, it was specially approved for export.

<h3>Will Japan Join the German-Italian Alliance?</h3>
<p>At a time when negotiations in Tokyo have stalled and British and French military representatives have set off for the Soviet Union, the long-dormant question of Japan's accession to the German-Italian alliance has suddenly resurfaced. The ostentatious secret meetings between the Japanese ambassador to Italy, Shiratori, and the Japanese ambassador to Germany, Oshima, indicate that Japan is about to join the German-Italian alliance. In fact, military cooperation between Japan, Germany, and Italy is not a new phenomenon. The novelty lies in the intricate timing of the three countries' military alliance and British foreign policy.</p>
<p>The three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy not only share a political stench and collude in aggression, but also, for example, the fact that the Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy are both military men, the exchange of intelligence, the frequent visits of staff officers, the supply of aircraft and munitions from Germany and Italy to Japan, and the visits of Generals Terauchi and Kaku to Berlin all these facts are sufficient to show that although the three countries have not concluded a military alliance, their Anti-Comintern Pact is already full of the smell of gunpowder! Moreover, their actions have long been coordinated. The Japanese scholar Tomita Ishimaru said: "The Pacific problem and the European problem are closely related. For example, at the time of the Munich Agreement, the victory of Germany and Italy was due to Japan's support in the Far East, which made Britain wary and forced it to kowtow to Germany." He also said, "On the other hand, Germany's victory in the Munich Conference exposed Britain's weakness and made it easier for Japan to conquer Guangdong and Hainan Island. In short, the Pacific power struggle and the European power struggle are closely related. This is why Japan, surrounded by Britain and the United States, joined hands with Germany and Italy, destroying a corner of the encirclement, and unfolding the result of a common front of countries with 'nothing' against countries with 'something.'"</p>
<p>Having seen through the relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy, one feels that the actual aggression of the past few years is more worthy of attention than the so-called conclusion of a military alliance. But European peacemakers are unwilling to understand this. Although they have witnessed the tearing up of several international treaties one by one, they still believe that treaties are sometimes effective. They have always considered the planned conclusion of a military alliance by Japan, Germany, and Italy to be more serious than real bloodshed or bloodless murder and national subjugation. This attitude has been seen through by Japan. For this reason, both the extremists who are trying hard to conclude a three-nation alliance and the moderates who oppose accepting military restrictions in Japan are performing various gestures to prepare for the conclusion of an alliance, using both hard and soft tactics. For example, the recent meeting between Ambassadors Oshima and Shiratori should have been secret in nature, and its mission was at most to exchange opinions and contribute them to Tokyo. They have neither the power to decide national policy nor are they conducting diplomacy with the host country. But they strut about, brag loudly, and are afraid that people will not pay attention to them. Who is this gesture being performed for? Its intention is nothing more than the following: Intimidation of Britain. Before February, the Japanese authorities were extremely silent, while their newspapers carried out various kinds of propaganda: the authorities "will not join the German-Italian alliance." As a result, British Prime Minister Chamberlain repeatedly expressed his feelings, saying that the anti-aggression front was not concerned with the Far East. He also accepted the encirclement of the Tianjin concession and proposed negotiations in Tokyo, and a preliminary humiliating compromise was reached. Now, Britain's attitude has become slightly tougher again due to the environment, and negotiations in Tokyo have stalled. Therefore, on the one hand, the Tokyo newspapers are shouting that "if Britain does not heed Japan's demands, the conference will break down," and on the other hand, they are widely releasing the air that Japan is about to join the German-Italian military alliance, ultimately hoping to force Britain to yield to Japan's conditions. Another effect is to try to undermine the ongoing British-Soviet cooperation. Although the British-Soviet negotiations are proceeding slowly, the British and French military representatives have recently set off for Moscow to hold staff talks with the Soviet Union. This indicates that the relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has made some progress. At this time, Japan suddenly indicated that it would conclude an alliance with Germany and Italy, which not only threatens Britain, but also makes France hesitant to follow Britain closely.</p>
<p>Whether Japan will join the German-Italian military alliance remains to be seen. Even if it does, it is not a new thing. As the British "Tough Newspaper" said, "The closer Japan cooperates with Germany and Italy, the stronger the linkage between the United States, the Soviet Union, and the democratic countries of Western Europe will be." This is what Japan is hesitant about.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Battle of Zhanggufeng Celebrated Nationwide in the Soviet Union; Commander of the Far East First Army, Stern, Publishes Commemorative Article Recalling the Battle and Praising the Consolidation of the Border Defenses</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet people today commemorate the first anniversary of the defeat of the Japanese army in the Lake Khasan area. All newspapers have published articles about the soldiers of that battle. The editorial of Pravda stated, "On August 6th of last year, every heroic unit of the Special Red Army began a general counter-offensive against the Japanese army, which had brazenly invaded the national border. Several hours later, the Soviet national flag was proudly raised on the summit of Zhanggufeng. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet ordered that August 6th be designated as the memorial day of the First Special Red Army." "Today, as the commanders and political personnel of the First Red Army celebrate their victory, they are also constantly examining themselves in their growth. Within this short period of one year, the combat effectiveness of the army has increased infinitely. All its soldiers, commanders, and political instructors are always ready to inflict a fatal blow on the aggressive madmen."</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Stern, Commander of the First Special Red Army, wrote an article in Pravda commemorating the victory at Zhanggufeng, saying, "As the Far East Red Army celebrates the first anniversary of its victory, it will not reduce its vigilance and combat readiness in the slightest. History has repeatedly proven that the Japanese militarists, who are the actual rulers of Japan, are prone to fits of madness. Although the Japanese military representatives have repeatedly publicly admitted that the Battle of Zhanggufeng was a mistake, the Japanese generals have ultimately failed to learn from that battle. As for the blameless Red Army, because it has deep faith in its own strength, it remains calm as a mountain, waiting for the mad enemy to shatter its scales on our ramparts."</p>
<p>Division Commander Lyadzherov also published an article in Pravda, saying, "One year ago, a very small unit of our air force underwent a field combat test. As a result, it was proven in the Battle of Zhanggufeng that our air force officers and soldiers can complete any task on land and in the air at any time. Today, if Chairman Stalin and Commissar Voroshilov were to order the mobilization of the entire air force, any aggressor would be reduced to ashes."</p>
<p>(Moscow) General Stern, commander of the First Army of the Soviet Far East Red Army, who last year commanded the troops in the Battle of Zhanggufeng and achieved outstanding merits, recently wrote articles in Pravda and Red Star on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Battle of Zhanggufeng, describing the situation at that time. The content is roughly the same. He said, among other things, that in tactical maneuvers, the number of infantrymen must be three times that of the enemy when attacking, and that secret preparations should be made in advance so that the enemy cannot detect them. Then, concentrate forces to attack one point on the enemy's flank to achieve success. In the Battle of Zhanggufeng last year, although the Soviet planes and tanks were more numerous than the Japanese, the number of infantrymen was smaller, and the Japanese had a very advantageous terrain. Not only were the numbers of Soviet tanks and artillery pieces clearly visible under their observation lines, but even the number of infantrymen could not be concealed. Therefore, the Soviet side did not have the conditions for an offensive. Before the offensive, it was impossible to make secret preparations, and because of the terrain, a flanking attack was also impossible. However, "the determination of the Soviet government and people to punish the aggressors and restore them to reason" meant that the Far East Red Army did not have time to consider everything and resolutely adopted an offensive posture, ultimately relying on the soldiers and officers to fight bravely and achieve victory. "To this day, the defense of the Soviet Far East Military District is strong and unbreakable." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today is the first anniversary of the Battle of Zhanggufeng. The Soviet government decided last year that a memorial ceremony should be held annually on this day to celebrate the victory of the Red Army. A public announcement was issued today, recalling the situation at that time and mentioning the skirmishes between the Soviet and Japanese armies, as well as the fighting on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo." Regarding this matter, observers say that neither the Soviet Union nor Japan has taken any diplomatic action. It is presumed that since the Soviet Union does not recognize "Manchukuo" and Japan does not recognize the Mongolian People's Republic, neither side will take any action to avoid the appearance of recognition. As for Japan's goal, opinions differ. According to military observers, Japan's intention is probably to cut off the land route for Soviet munitions to China. This route starts in Kulun and runs south to Bayantu. At the beginning of the conflict between the Soviet and Japanese armies, the Japanese sent planes to bomb Bayantu, which shows this. As for the roads from Kulun to China, there are two others, both to the west, beyond the reach of the "Manchukuo" planes. In addition, Japan may want to occupy the south bank of the Khalkhin River to protect its military bases in Hailar. (The distance between Hailar and the Outer Mongolian border is only about one hundred kilometers.) This is also unknown. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Remittances from Chongqing to Shanghai Subject to a 40% Exchange Fee; No Exchange Fee for Remittances from Shanghai to the Interior; Purpose is to Prevent the Outflow of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to the Ministry of Finance today, remittances to Shanghai are subject to a 40% exchange fee. At the same time, the amount of remittances is limited to 100 yuan. In other words, remitting 100 yuan to Shanghai requires an exchange fee of 40 yuan. However, there is no exchange fee for remittances from Shanghai to the interior. This measure is said to be aimed at preventing the outflow of legal tender and preventing it from being obtained by the Japanese to purchase foreign exchange. According to the Ministry of Finance, the demand for legal tender in Shanghai will not be affected because the four banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China, hold about 10 million yuan in legal tender, which is sufficient to meet the needs of Shanghai.

The British warship HMS Duncan (1,400 tons) is scheduled to go to Shantou tonight. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Danzig City Council Responds to Polish Note; Polish Border Customs Officers Ordered to Carry Weapons; Negotiations to be Conducted on the Issue of Customs Officials' Powers</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the issue of Polish customs officials in the Free City of Danzig customs office, the semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message, stating that the Polish government's note, similar to an ultimatum, will be rejected by the Danzig City Council. It was rumored that the Danzig Customs Authority intended to prevent some Polish customs officials from performing their duties from 7:00 a.m. on the 6th of this month, but this was not the case. After hearing the rumors, the Polish High Commissioner, Chodacki, originally intended to protest by telephone in an "inopportune manner," but instead presented a note similar to an ultimatum and threatened retaliation. In fact, this rumor was completely unfounded, and the tone of the note was extremely inappropriate. The Danzig City Council believes in principle that it is not necessary to consider the deadline set by the note, nor is it possible to respond immediately. In the opinion of the Free City's responsible parties, the Polish note has provocative significance. This decision is entirely a propaganda campaign, intended to create an atmosphere of panic and prevent the City Council from maintaining its composure. However, the City Council is still able to deal with it calmly, but only to see the other party's mental exhaustion. In general, the City Council will state in its reply that Chodacki's attitude is unexpected, the Polish note is based on rumors, its tone is abnormal, and it contains threats. The City Council has no choice but to regard it as inappropriate and resolutely reject it." In addition, the City Council will conduct negotiations with Chodacki on the issue of the powers of Polish customs officials and resolve it effectively. In general, those who claim to be customs officials but whose duties are completely unrelated to customs matters will no longer be recognized. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Danzig The Polish customs inspectors on the border with East Prussia have been ordered to carry weapons while on duty. This can be seen as a sign that Poland is determined not to be pressured to withdraw its customs officials from Danzig. At the end of the week, Poland sent a note to the Danzig City Council, stating that Poland would maintain its economic rights in Danzig by all means it deemed necessary, but Poland was very willing to conduct detailed discussions in order to resolve the matter peacefully. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Danzig Free City The City Council Information Office recently issued a bulletin stating, "Regarding the issue of the treatment of customs officials of Polish nationality, the note presented by the Polish government is threatening. The City Council has submitted a reply to the Polish High Commissioner, Chodacki." According to the City authorities, they had previously considered recognizing those Polish customs officials who belonged to the Polish Ministry of Finance, and treating those who belonged to military organs as "border customs officials" and limiting their service. The Polish authorities then presented a strong note demanding the abolition of this distinction. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Danzig According to HTS from reliable political sources, the leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party, Forster, will go to Berchtesgaden today to meet with Hitler and hold consultations. The content will be related to the resolution of the customs official issue. (HTS dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Danzig The Polish government previously warned the City of Danzig that Polish customs inspectors would wear uniforms and be fully armed for security reasons. This warning was realized yesterday, but it is believed that this measure may be cancelled today. The Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig, Chodacki, is scheduled to discuss and clarify this issue with the Chairman of the Danzig City Council, Greiser, on the 9th of this month.

<h3>Commemoration of Piłsudski's Mobilization; Poland Celebrates with Enthusiasm; 50,000 Volunteers Participate in Parade; Polish People Express True Intentions</h3>
<p>Kraków, Poland Today marks the 25th anniversary of the mobilization of volunteers by the late Polish Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski, to engage in the national restoration movement and participate in the European War. A grand ceremony was held here. 50,000 personnel from the former volunteer army, organized according to the conditions of 25 years ago, paraded for two hours and were reviewed by General Smigly-Rydz and the wife of the late Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski. Foreign Minister Beck also marched with the soldiers of the First Regiment of Light Artillery, and the audience cheered. Members of veteran groups, military training groups, and patriotic groups also participated in the parade. When the crowd saw the representatives of the Port of Gdynia (near the Free City of Danzig) and the Teschen region (formerly part of Czechoslovakia, which was ceded to Poland in September of last year), they cheered enthusiastically. In addition, eight elderly veterans who participated in the Polish War of Independence in 1863 also participated in the procession in two cars. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Warsaw Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz and Foreign Ministry Colonel Beck, who participated in the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Polish Volunteer Army in Kraków, returned to the capital together in the evening. Newspapers here are now full of descriptions of the commemorative ceremony and publish the full text of General Smigly-Rydz's speech, all saying that Poland is united as a nation and determined to resist aggression. The government's Morning Express reported, "Foreigners who closely watched the commemorative ceremony in Kraków all know that General Smigly-Rydz's words are sufficient to express Poland's true intentions. There is no doubt how Poland will respond if someone intends to infringe on Polish interests. The people of Kraków solemnly swore that they would fight for the independence of their country in wartime until victory. We now make the same oath and are determined to fulfill it. Those who add aggression will inevitably invite disaster and collapse. It is hoped that those who dream of aggression will think deeply about it." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>British and French Public Opinion Expresses Satisfaction</h3>
<p>(London) The Polish Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz's impassioned speech in Kraków yesterday, which included the words "If there is any direct or indirect attempt to harm or destroy Polish rights, Poland will resist with all its strength," has aroused a good impression in the countries of the Peace Front. However, National Socialist critics in Berlin said that this kind of speech did not make a valuable new contribution to the current situation. A German spokesman said that General Smigly-Rydz spoke of Poland's lack of aggressive intentions, but the spirit of calling for war that is now present in Poland and abroad seems to want to open war with Germany. French countries consider the Polish Army Inspector General's speech to be a clear warning to Germany. Le Temps reported that this shows that Poland is unwilling to back down. If Germany launches an aggression, Warsaw will immediately make a military response. People in London are very interested in this speech. According to Reuters, official circles believe that it is completely in line with Poland's consistent policy, because Poland has never made a showy expression, and its policy has always been very clear and reasonable. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Polish Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz's powerful speech in Kraków yesterday has been unanimously praised by newspapers here. Among them, the right-wing Le Temps cited this speech to explain the current situation, saying, "The Versailles Treaty's privileges granted to Poland regarding the Free City of Danzig, the country is determined to maintain, even if it means going to war. This can be seen in General Smigly-Rydz's words. As for the mutual assistance agreements established between that country and Britain and France, Britain and France, as well as the opinions of other countries, all agree. Tracing back to March 15 of this year, the world knows that if the countries concerned allow German leader Hitler to launch an aggression, or at least allow him to threaten with aggression, then no group will be able to stop it. Germany's goal is to destroy Poland, just as it destroyed Czechoslovakia. The dispute over the Free City of Danzig is not economic in nature, nor is it ethnic in nature. The crux of the matter is whether the German dictator can dominate Europe alone." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers here have praised the speech given by the Polish Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz in Kraków. Le Jour wrote, "Poland has fully expressed its spirit of endurance in recent weeks, which is admirable. Now the country's highest military leader, who is also the heir to the late Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski, has now informed European countries that Poland's endurance also has its limits. The tone is firm and no different from practical action. It can be seen that Poland will never succumb to violence. If Germany takes aggressive action, Poland will immediately respond militarily. Negotiations of all kinds, with the aim of ceding the Free City of Danzig to Germany, are not acceptable to Poland." Le Paris-Soir wrote, "General Smigly-Rydz's speech was impassioned and did not lose the spirit of a soldier, and its tone was firm and did not need to be commented on. Whether reading the original text or translating it into German, there is no ambiguity." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Reveal Resentful Mood</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Newspapers here have commented on the speech given by the Polish Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz with words of indignation, which can be seen in the titles used. The Monday Report's headline said, "The saying that the City of Danzig is the economic lifeline of Poland can be described as a ridiculous joke." The Monday Post's headline: "General Smigly-Rydz's platitudes." In addition, the semi-official German News Agency issued a message stating that Piłsudski's followers are now celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Polish rebellion, but the Polish government is not following Piłsudski's policy. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Britain, France, and Turkey Agree on Military Agreement; Emphasis on the Defense of Thessaloniki</h3>
<p>(London) After the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement between Turkey and Britain and France, talks are now continuing to agree on a military agreement to complement the mutual assistance agreement. Regarding this, what the Turkish government values most is the issue of the defense of the Greek city of Thessaloniki. According to sources familiar with the matter, a certain important Italian figure once told a diplomat from a certain country that once a war breaks out in Europe, Italy will try to occupy Thessaloniki. At this time, Italy is already making various military preparations within Albania, such as concentrating a large number of troops and mechanized units and air force, and building strategic highways to the Greek border. All of this is sufficient to prove that Italy is indeed planning to attack Greece after the outbreak of the war. Its goal is nothing more than to isolate Greece from its ally Turkey. If this is achieved, the strategic situation of Turkey and its allies in the Aegean Sea and the Balkans will inevitably be greatly affected. Following this evolution, Italy will be able to collude with Bulgaria to coerce Yugoslavia and Romania. Therefore, we should plan ahead and take appropriate precautions. Turkey has concentrated a large number of troops in the Adalar region (located at the junction of Turkey, Bulgaria, and Greece), said to number as many as 200,000, in order to be able to deploy them in the event of an emergency. According to British military sources, General Heringer, commander of the French forces in the Near East (who led the French delegation to conduct talks with the Turkish military authorities), recently came to London and has also discussed the issue of jointly defending the Thessaloniki region with the British military authorities.

<h3>British War Secretary Visits Paris</h3>

Among the Bulgarian delegation are many important figures, such as House Budget Committee Chairman Gusev, who is the brother of Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Gusev, and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Koviturov.

<h3>Göring Speech Criticizes Britain</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Aviation Minister General Göring said in a speech in Thasos today that Germany's eager and united determination will not allow another Versailles Treaty to appear. In the future, we will never allow any of our important interests to be opposed. Threats and inducements cannot move us. We do not want war. We are actively preparing for military equipment, but this is only for our own survival if we are forced to fight. Britain is eager to repeat the comedy of 1914, intending to make Germany accept a peace treaty that is worse than the Treaty of Versailles. It must be known that the current situation is fundamentally different from the past. Today, we are full of eager and united determination and will never allow another Versailles Treaty to reappear in the future. We do not threaten Britain, but if Britain thinks it can stop Germany's progress in all parts of the world, then Britain must bear the responsibility for disturbing the peace. The threat of blockading and starving Germany must not be allowed to happen a second time, because the German Air Force will pay attention to this and because Germany has now stored a lot of food.

<h3>Third Phase of Italian Military Exercises; 150,000 People Participate</h3>
<p>(Rome) The third phase of the Italian military exercises, which will determine the outcome, began yesterday. The mechanized units of the Po River Defense Force first came into contact with the attacking army from the French border. The large number of German journalists and other observers who came here to watch the exercise has attracted general attention. It is believed that Berlin is eagerly awaiting responsible reports on the effectiveness of the Italian army and the practical value of the Italian army's theory of rapid decision. Among the military leaders who came here to watch the exercise were German Chief of Staff Halder and Hungarian Chief of Staff Weitzer. The exercise area covers 220 miles in length and 45 miles in width, and the participating troops include 150,000 people and air force units. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>US Treasury Secretary Travels from England to Denmark</h3>
<p>Southampton, England US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, who came to Europe for a tour on the French mail ship Normandie from New York, has arrived here and told reporters, "This is purely a private holiday trip. At 4:00 this afternoon, I will take a boat from Harwich Harbour in Essex to Denmark for a tour. It can be seen that I have no public duties in London, and today is a bank holiday, so people in the banking community cannot meet. This trip is scheduled to return home on the original ship on the sixth of next month." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Restoration Movement Encounters Obstacles; Deposed King Alfonso Unwilling to Be a Puppet; Duke of Maura and Franco Break Off Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Paris) The right-wing "Action Française" newspaper recently reported that Duke of Maura of Spain, one of the leaders of the Spanish monarchist faction, had been residing in Estoril, Portugal, since the Spanish Civil War. He recently flew to Santoña, Spain, and then traveled by car to Burgos to meet with General Franco, the head of the Spanish state. The two had been apart for three years and were delighted to see each other again. Also present were Interior Minister Suñer, Foreign Minister Jordana, and a member of the German Embassy. General Franco reportedly told Duke Maura that he welcomed the restoration of deposed King Alfonso XIII, but asked that he recognize the Falangist Spanish Traditionalist Phalanx and of the JONS as the supreme authority. Duke Maura immediately replied that the royal prerogative, including the power to convene and dissolve parliament, was a privilege inherited through generations, and Alfonso XIII was unwilling to relinquish it. He would only return to govern after a national referendum expressing support, but would not accept any conditions. Foreign Minister Jordana then tried to reconcile the two sides, suggesting that Alfonso XIII abdicate and his son, Prince Juan, ascend the throne. Duke Maura responded that Prince Juan was also determined to maintain the royal prerogative, which was inconsistent with Alfonso XIII's initial stance. The next day, General Franco issued an order declaring himself the head of state, responsible only to God and history. (Havas, 7th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Naval Military Discusses European Policy; Five-Minister Conference to Be Held Today; Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in Sees the Emperor; Anglo-Japanese Talks to Resume Today</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At 3:00 PM today, Minister of the Army Itagaki visited Minister of the Navy Yonai to explain the army's policy regarding the new situation in Europe, and the results of his discussion with Prime Minister Hiranuma last night. The two ministers exchanged views for two and a half hours. After Itagaki left, he immediately convened an emergency meeting of army administrative staff to report on the details of the talks with the Navy Minister. Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in visited the Emperor in Hayama this morning to report on various matters. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British government's response regarding the Anglo-Japanese talks arrived at the British Embassy on the evening of the 7th. However, the Embassy stated that it had not yet received the final views from its home country. Ambassador Craigie, who is currently recuperating in Hakone, will return to Tokyo on the morning of the 8th. If the British response has arrived, the seventh round of negotiations will be held on the afternoon of the 8th. If the British side still does not make any announcements on the afternoon of the 8th, the Japanese side will consider Britain's delay to be inappropriate. (Domei, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Authoritative sources announced last night that a partial resolution of the Tianjin case could be achieved as a result of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. The agreement to be signed between Britain and Japan includes the following four points: (1) British concession authorities will cooperate with the Japanese army to crack down on anti-Japanese activities within the concession. (2) The issue of transferring the four suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case will not be resolved in the agreement unless the Japanese side can provide new evidence of their guilt. (3) A Japanese national will be appointed as an advisor to the Tianjin British Concession's Municipal Council. (4) Anti-Japanese propaganda will be controlled and the Communist Party will be suppressed. The British government has not yet sent new instructions to Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan. The cabinet is still considering the ambassador's final report. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before the emergency Five-Minister Conference is held on the 8th, the army authorities held a headquarters meeting at the Army Minister's residence at 10:00 AM on the 7th. Those present included Army Minister Itagaki, Decision Officer Yamawaki, Military Affairs Bureau Chief Machijiri, Military Affairs Section Chief Arisue, and Military Affairs Section Chief Iwakuro. Based on the decision of the three bureau chiefs' meeting on the 3rd of this month, they discussed specific measures for the army's policy to cope with tomorrow's Five-Minister Conference until noon. Later, Deputy Chief of Staff Nakajima, and Chiefs of various Bureaus including Kawahara, Hashimoto, and Kiwaguchi, and Colonel Tatsumi from the General Staff participated and the joint discussion continued in the afternoon. (Domei, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the recent developments in the international situation, and because Minister of the Army Itagaki expressed his hope on July 18, the government authorities decided to hold an emergency Five-Minister Conference after the regular cabinet meeting on the 8th to conduct important discussions in order to realize this hope. In addition, Minister of the Army Itagaki visited Prime Minister Hiranuma last night to report on the opinions on measures to cope with the European situation decided by the Army's Three Bureau Chiefs meeting on the 3rd of this month. The Prime Minister replied that he fully understood the intentions of the military authorities. (Domei, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated today during a reception for journalists that no reports had been received here regarding the meeting between Ambassador Oshima to Germany and Ambassador Shiratori to Italy on August 3 in Como to discuss Japan's participation in the German-Italian military alliance. He declined to comment on news reports of close cooperation between Japan and the Axis powers and was also unwilling to disclose the details of the German-Italian-Japanese negotiations. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British government's instructions to Ambassador Craigie, which will determine the success of the Tokyo Conference, still had not arrived on the 7th. Therefore, the seventh round of talks could not be held today. The Japanese side is continuing to seriously monitor Britain's attitude and adopt a waiting posture. Major Miyamoto, the local representative of the army, contacted the foreign affairs authorities by telephone this morning and it seems that they have reached a consensus. They have decided to wait another day, the 8th. If there is still no certainty about holding the conference, it will be considered necessary for the Japanese side to take any effective and appropriate measures. (Domei, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Neither the round table conference nor the subcommittees met today, presumably because the London instructions had not yet arrived. Japanese newspapers declared that if Britain does not heed Japan's demands, the conference will break down. However, if it acknowledges Japan's demands, a compromise can be quickly reached. It was also stated that if there is an improper delay in the London instructions, the Japanese government will have to make a major decision to cope with the situation. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>British, French, and Soviet Staff Talks May Conclude by the End of September</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to the "Paris Midi" newspaper, the staff talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may not conclude until the end of September at the earliest due to the complexity of the issues under discussion. The newspaper continued that Poland and Romania will also send representatives to participate in the talks to discuss the cooperation between the two countries and the military alliance of the three countries. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The "Daily Telegraph" published a report from its Moscow correspondent discussing the current state of the Moscow negotiations in detail. According to the report, the Soviet Union requires sufficient guarantees regarding the security of the Baltic states, including protection even from the indirect risk of attack. The correspondent believes that the naval conference will inevitably recommend naval cooperation between the Black Sea and Baltic Sea fleets. The Soviet Union has no need to worry about this. The correspondent also explained in detail the differences in attitude and diplomatic customs between Britain and the Soviet Union. The British only need to stipulate the basic principles for the alliance agreement and can be general. If the two sides cannot trust each other on basic principles, what else is there to discuss in detail? (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the current stage of the Moscow negotiations, the "Paris Midi" newspaper published an article commenting that the Soviet government insists that all political and military negotiations must include the Far East. Moscow believes that the Anglo-Japanese conflict in Tianjin proves that Western European countries must cooperate with the Soviet Union in the Far East, and that the attitude adopted by the United States towards Japan is helpful for this cooperation. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<h3>Singapore Greatly Increases Defense Forces</h3>
<p>The troops stationed in Singapore are extremely active today. Although the government side claims it is preparing for the usual weekly holiday, reliable sources say that more troops will arrive here from India tomorrow. The army coming from India will have at least 8,000 men to strengthen the defenses here. At the same time, two squadrons of bombers stationed in India, namely the Bristol Squadron and the Blenheim Squadron, are scheduled to arrive here tonight. Other air force squadrons may also arrive here in a short period of time. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<h3>Sakhalin-Urai Petroleum Co. Signs New Contract with Soviet Union; Wages Increased by 15%; Expires at the End of November This Year</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The labor contract signed by the Sakhalin-Urai Petroleum Co. with the Soviet Trade Union expired on December 5 last year. Negotiations for a new contract were continued, but the issue of wage increases was delayed. The workers have been on strike until today, when representatives of the petroleum company and the Soviet trade union agreed on the outline of the new contract. However, the details will not be finalized until the end of this month, when the contract can be signed. It is said that the main points of the new contract stipulate (1) a 15% increase in wages for Soviet workers, starting from the date of expiration of the old contract on December 5 last year, and (2) all Soviet workers should return to work before the end of this month, and wages will be paid for the strike period. (3) The new contract will take effect from December last year and will expire at the end of November this year. The general public is commenting that the climate on Sakhalin Island is cold and the mining of each oil field must stop between September and October, and the effective period of the new contract will expire at the end of November this year. It can be seen that this solution is still difficult to sustain. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry announced today that the news report that the Sakhalin Petroleum Company and representatives of the Far East Soviet Trade Union had agreed on a labor contract has been confirmed by official reports received in Tokyo. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" commented on this matter, saying that it is not appropriate to be too optimistic. The working season on Northern Sakhalin Island begins in June. Although those who have the right to extract oil have applied to the Soviet authorities to recruit 870 Japanese workers and 2,050 Soviet workers, no workers have been working to date. Although the contract established in Moscow can solve the problem of recruiting workers, half of the working period has passed, and the problems of food, fuel, and medical supplies are still pending. Therefore, it is too early to be optimistic about the future of Japanese oil and coal mining on Northern Sakhalin Island at present. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Australian Federal Prime Minister Issues Statement; If Britain Joins the War, the Federation Will Act in Unison</h3>
<p>The "Melbourne German Essen National Newspaper" (known as the organ of the country's Aviation Minister Göring) recently published that if war breaks out in Europe, the Australian Federation will remain neutral. Federal Minister of the Interior Hughes has issued a statement to correct this, saying that "if Britain is drawn into war because of the implementation of its current policies, then the Australian Federation will definitely act in unison with it."

<h3>American Giant Aircraft Crosses the North Atlantic; Sets Record</h3>
<p>The Pan American Airways giant aircraft "American Clipper" No. 1, carrying 27 passengers and 12 crew members, took off from Port Washington near New York, USA yesterday and landed here after flying across the North Atlantic in 24 hours, setting a record. On the way, it happened to meet the British Imperial Airways giant seaplane "Calypso," which was flying to America. It can be said that it was a coincidence. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>British Mail Plane Arrives in New York</h3>
<p>(New York) The British Imperial Airways aircraft "Calypso" arrived here at 9:27 AM today. The inaugural flight of the air mail service across the Atlantic, departing from Southampton, England, has been completed. The captain of the aircraft, Rogers, said that the flight from Foynes, Ireland, to Botwood, Newfoundland, was quite difficult because it had to fly against the wind and the wind was very strong. The journey took 19 and a half hours, with an average speed of 89.5 knots per hour. They flew blind in heavy rain for nine hours and encountered fog for seven and a half hours. The journey of any aircraft crossing the Atlantic may be considered the longest. The Calypso carried 1,500 pounds of mail and arrived here via Foynes, Botwood, and Montreal. The "Calypso" and "Cavalier" aircraft will carry mail back and forth across the Atlantic every week until the end of September. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Postmaster General Farley Tours Europe</h3>
<p>U.S. Postmaster General Farley is touring Europe in his private capacity and has arrived here from Berlin with his two daughters, staying at the private residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Poland, planning to stay for a few days. He recently gave a speech to the press, saying, "Among my good friends in the United States, there are many Poles, so I know the advantages of the Polish nation. I am very happy to come to your country." (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Britain Holds Air Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>(London) 1,300 British military aircraft are scheduled to conduct large-scale air defense exercises in the south from 8:00 AM tomorrow to 7:00 PM on the 10th. The scope is far greater than in the past. Among the aircraft participating in the exercise, 800 will be the "defenders," concentrated in Worcestershire and the Hampshire coast. The remaining 500 aircraft will form the "attackers," or the so-called "enemy." In addition, 50 reconnaissance aircraft will be dispatched to report on the exercise results at any time. The "enemy aircraft" will attempt to bomb various parts of the south, so that the efficiency of the anti-aircraft artillery can be tested in practice. In general, the period from midnight on the 9th of this month to dawn on the 10th will be the most exciting time for the air force exercises. All of London and 26 counties in southeastern England will implement a blackout. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Hungary's Restoration 20th Anniversary</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Beijing held a celebration ceremony for the 20th anniversary of Hungary's restoration. All Hungarian government officials, as well as the ambassadors of Germany, Italy, and Japan stationed in Hungary, attended the meeting. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<h3>France Exploits Oil Fields in Border Areas</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Minister of Public Works Monzi went to Saint-Gaudens near the Pyrenees yesterday to inspect the oil exploitation project. According to 20 years of scientific investigation results, the oil reserves there are extremely rich. The well has now reached a depth of 1,520 meters. Once the latest equipment arrives from the United States in January next year, it is expected to be able to extract petroleum. It is said that the reason why the French government is actively exploiting oil is because the country needs 5 million tons every year, while the country only produces 100,000 tons.

<h3>Siamese Government Arrests Overseas Chinese En Masse</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Siam's attitude towards China has recently changed suddenly. According to reliable information from the Siamese side on July 28, the Siamese government has been arresting Chinese national salvation activists for days. Kuomintang members Liang Weicheng and Chen Wentian have also been arrested. More than 20 Chinese schools were investigated this month, and the two banks of overseas Chinese were searched because receipts for national salvation donations were found, and their managers and deputy managers were detained. The situation is serious and the overseas Chinese community is panic-stricken. (7th Telegram)</p>
<h3>It Is Difficult to Confirm Siam's Participation in the Anti-Communist Pact</h3>
<p>(London) According to rumors, Siam has already joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. Sources close to the Foreign Ministry have recently declared that this statement has not been officially confirmed. Even well-informed people are unwilling to express any opinion without official confirmation. They only said that Japan has indeed been actively wooing Siam recently, but according to recent news, the Siamese government is prudent in all matters and may not be willing to share its fate with Japan.

<h3>American Aviators, the Maddy Brothers, Set Endurance Flight Record; Flying for a Total of 343 Hours and 46 Minutes</h3>
<p>The American aviators, the Maddy brothers, of Springfield, Illinois, USA, have been making endurance flights in a light aircraft since the 2nd of this month, for a period of five days, saying that they would not land until the engine stopped working. Unexpectedly, when flying to Japan in the morning, they suddenly encountered a rainstorm, and its engine, estimated to have 55 horsepower, could not withstand it. They were forced to land at 4:46 AM (Greenwich time), for a total of 343 hours and 46 minutes, breaking all records. According to world records, it was only 118 hours. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Yichang; Bombs Fall on Areas Concentrated with British Nationals; Two Jardine Matheson Ships Destroyed; Significant Damage to British Commercial Property</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that Japanese military aircraft bombed Yichang twice yesterday (the 6th) within a six-hour period, deliberately dropping bombs on one of the areas concentrated with British nationals, destroying Jardine Matheson's "Kiawo" and "Shunchang" ships, and Jardine Engineering Corporation’s riverside property. One bomb fell 30 feet from the "Shunchang" ship, injuring British staff member Mr. Duer's arm. Two Chinese sailors died and three were injured. British naval authorities had notified the Japanese side in advance that the area was a concentrated area for foreign women and children, and reported the movements of all British ships to the Japanese naval authorities on a daily basis. Each of the British ships was painted with the Union Jack to clearly indicate them. All of these facts suggest that the attack was a deliberate bombing of British nationals and property. Yesterday's attack was the third in the past few months. Under similar circumstances, Japanese aircraft bombed Jardine Matheson ships in Zhenjiang last December and in Wuhu this March. According to telegrams received by Jardine Matheson, the first attack occurred at 5:00 AM in the morning. Twelve Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil depot. The site was about two and a half miles from the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company. One bomb fell into the water 30 feet from the "Shunchang" ship, injuring Mr. Duer's arm, killing two Chinese sailors and injuring three others. The "Kiawo" ship, berthed next to the Jardine Matheson wharf, was hit by several bombs within 100 feet, but was not damaged. However, Jardine Engineering Corporation’s riverside property was severely damaged in the air raid. In the second air raid at 11:00 AM in the morning, Japanese bombers flew very low without resistance, dropping incendiary bombs on the "Kiawo" and "Shunchang" ships (both weighing 2,000 tons) berthed next to the Asiatic Petroleum Company. The two ships immediately caught fire and were completely burned above the waterline. The British warship "HMS Gnat" was berthed near the bombed area and was fortunately not hit, but quickly sailed to put out the fire. The fire was brought under control at around 1:30 PM. Although the two ships were severely burned, they remained afloat. There were no further deaths or injuries from the fire. The "Kiawo" ship was a major ship on the river and had been rented by the British government several times. In addition to bombing the riverside property and ships, Japanese aircraft dropped many bombs in the city, starting fires in many places. The exact details of the damage are not clear this morning (the 7th).</p>
<h3>Chaotic Scenes in Shantou; Japanese Army Promotes Anti-British Propaganda; British Consul Humiliated</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Japanese army along the coast has recently been engaged in guerrilla warfare. This is actually a strategy of feinting in one direction while attacking in another, selecting key transportation points along the coast and launching surprise attacks to occupy them with a small number of troops, and then moving on to other plans. The purpose is to use the convenience of fleet transportation to tie down the main force of the Chinese army in one corner with a small number of troops, creating a stalemate. In the Chaojie area, the two armies have now entered a stalemate. The Japanese army suddenly shifted to Shanwei and suffered a setback when invading Shanwei on the 20th. They then disturbed Daya Bay, Aotou, Hengmen of Zhongshan County, Furong Mountain, and Boliwei. Recently, they concentrated their fleet in Daya Bay and disturbed Dangshi. This is nothing more than using a trick of roving attacks to confuse the Chinese army and cause repeated disturbances.</p>
<p>Due to the blockage of ships on the Han River, Shantou's urban area is isolated from the various counties. Charcoal, rice, cooking oil, salt, vegetables, meat, eggs, and everything else are lacking. The Japanese army relies entirely on canned food shipped from Taiwan for supplies. The civilians who have not fled are like prisoners in a cage. The electric lights were completely destroyed and the water tower and main pipes of the waterworks were completely destroyed. The civilians relied entirely on coolies and opium addicts to fetch water from the river at the train station. Last month, each load cost four jiao in silver dollars, but now it costs more than one dollar, because the opium addicts and ruffians have mostly become counterfeit and no longer work as water carriers. Moreover, the river water is extremely unclean, because the riverbank is piled with corpses and no one is burying them, causing epidemics among residents who drink the water. Doctors and medicines are both lacking. Even after death, there are no coffins for burial. The Japanese army does not allow people to do good deeds or provide relief. The situation is extremely miserable.</p>
<p>After the Japanese side pulled out Chen Juemin to serve as the head of the puppet local maintenance association, they recently promoted the establishment of a fake Huichaojia government. A certain newspaper's printing press has been seized by the Japanese army and renamed "Yuedong Bao" to promote anti-British sentiment. The Shantou Post Office was forced to resume operations, but there were no ships to transport goods in or out, so no mail arrived in Shantou. As for newspapers and magazines, except for those given to foreigners, all were confiscated and detained by the Japanese army. Foreigners' letters were also opened and inspected. After the French Consul Carvoun protested, letters received by foreign consuls were sent as usual. The Japanese Navy restricted British ships to one per week to enter Shantou, only allowing them to load mail and not allowing passengers or cargo to land. Each time a British ship entered the port, it had to report to the Japanese commander 24 hours in advance. The British Consul stationed in Shantou was pushed to the ground by a Japanese sentry. The British Consul's secretariat was forcibly occupied by the Japanese army. The residence of the Customs Tax Officer (a British national) in Jiaoshi was also occupied. A British employee of Brunner Mond &amp; Co. was slapped. The British side has not protested. As for the telephone bureau, it was fortunately preserved because of American business capital. American-owned firms, churches, and other buildings were initially occupied by the Japanese army, but they voluntarily withdrew after American sailors arrived to protect them.</p>
<p>The great fire in Chao'an City lasted for four days. More than 2,000 Japanese troops were stationed in Zhugaoshan, Bijia Mountain, Hulushan, Jinshan, and other places outside the city. The Japanese military command post was located at the County Middle School and the Yingzhou Hotel. The Fujita and Iijima units of the Japanese army in Shantou have now been secretly transferred elsewhere and replaced by 150 men from Li Daoxuan's fake advance team, who are being monitored by 80 military police. Shantou is no longer a world city.</p>
<h3>Dinghai After the Robbery: The Market is Extremely Desolate</h3>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence: More than a month has passed since Dinghai fell. Although most of the major stores were forced to reopen, because residents dare not go out to shop, the doors are deserted, and business is very sluggish. Also, most residents, although they have returned to the city, are afraid of the rampant Japanese army, so they live in seclusion and rarely go out. Young women and men have disappeared from the streets. Slightly more courageous elderly people only walk in the middle of the day. Once evening arrives, they all go home. As for the Japanese army, they fear attacks by Chinese guerrillas, so they station troops everywhere to stand guard. At each city gate, six or seven people are stationed. In the evening, the city gates are tightly closed, and by 8 p.m., a curfew is enforced, so the market is extremely desolate.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese army has opened gambling dens, brothels, and opium dens everywhere in the city. Residents must salute whenever they encounter Japanese soldiers on guard. However, farmers in the countryside are often beaten because their saluting posture is incorrect, while those who salute correctly are falsely accused of being intellectuals or military personnel and are subjected to severe torture. Therefore, the people cannot bear the suffering. Recently, the Japanese army demanded 30 beautiful women from the puppet autonomous committee, but they did not want local prostitutes or other women, so the group of ugly officials in the committee felt very embarrassed. Ten young teachers have been killed. The remaining puppet autonomous committee recently published a newspaper called "Zhoushan Xinbao" (New Zhoushan Daily), the content of which is extremely absurd, and there are very few readers.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Puppets Impose Harsh Taxes and Establish a Puppet Customs Bureau</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: The Nanjing puppet Ministry of Industry recently established the Lianghuai Salt Affairs Administration in Yangzhou. The puppet director of the Huainan district is Wu Benyue, and the puppet director of the Huaibei district is Yang Furen, along with a Japanese named Kato Ken. After the establishment of this bureau, the official salt warehouse was closed, and harsh taxes were imposed. Every dan (unit of weight) of salt transported into Yangzhou city is subject to a tax of five yuan. Salt shops that obtain a license to sell are charged three yuan and six jiao. Ordinary merchants are reluctant to proceed. Recently, the puppet director Wu Bentie also investigated the sales volume and vat openings of salt basins and soy sauce gardens, intending to actively promote official sales.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Attacks Tongli, Puppet Police Retreat in Disarray</h3>
<p>Wujiang Correspondence: Tongli Town is surrounded by lakes, making its situation excellent. A small number of Japanese troops are stationed in the town, colluding with the Wujiang puppet "Police First Squadron" to extort donations and search wantonly. A few days ago, guerrillas from the Shuangmiaogang Qingshuiyang area suddenly attacked the town, engaging in battle with the puppet "police force" at Ye Zehu Shuangmiaogang. The puppet police fled to the Shitou Tan area of Nandao. The Dong Zhongjia Bang in Tunhu Village was occupied by the guerrillas. The Japanese puppet army launched a large-scale rescue operation, opening fire near Tunhu Village. After several hours of fighting, the Japanese puppet forces were defeated and retreated.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of the Southwest (Continued)</h3>
<p>3.  Passing Through Hanoi</p>
<p>In addition to making Hanoi a political center (the Governor-General's residence), the French government also wants to make it a transportation center. Therefore, on the map, the railway networks south to Saigon, east to Haiphong, northwest to Kunming, and northeast to Lang Son and Dong Dang all have Hanoi as their core. However, except for the first route to Saigon, which indeed departs from Hanoi, the other routes actually converge at Gia Lam, more than 20 li east of Hanoi. From Gia Lam to Hanoi is only a section that encompasses the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and its branch lines. We entered and exited this section twice from Haiphong to Lang Son, which was really uneconomical in terms of time.</p>
<p>To complete the journey between Haiphong and Lang Son in one day, one must depart in the morning. The first slow train from Haiphong (fast trains cannot carry much luggage) took us on our journey. The ride was extremely bumpy, and the noise was deafening. This was probably due to the lightness of the rails or the speed of the train. The train stopped at every station along the way. When it stopped, large numbers of Annamese people got on and off. Regardless of how crowded the carriages were, they always carried entire loads of things onto the train. Some even carried their entire household possessions onto the train, leaving no room to even sit down. We saw a person carrying a load of goldfish, using all their strength to barely manage half of the load, but the train started mercilessly. The remaining half of the load was hanging outside, and one by one, the jars and pots on top were thrown out of the train due to centrifugal force. Finally, when the train stopped at the next station, only a few dried-up goldfish remained.</p>
<p>When the train arrived at Gia Lam, there was a 15-minute stop. Passengers going to Kunming got off here. On the platform next to it, a train from Hanoi on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was waiting. This hurried transfer was very tense. Five minutes after leaving Gia Lam, the train crossed the bridge built on the Fulang River (Red River). This is the longest railway bridge in the Far East, with a total length of two and a half kilometers. The train travels at a speed of 15 kilometers per hour, taking ten minutes to complete the entire journey. The Fulang River originates in Yunnan, China, and is called the Yuan River. After entering Annam, it carries a lot of mud and sand, and the water turns red, so it is commonly known as the Red River. The current is very rapid, and there are whirlpools everywhere in Hanoi. Small boats travel along the edge of the whirlpools. If one is not careful, there is a danger of capsizing. There is a large sandbar in the middle of the river where the bridge is built, dividing the river into two branches, so when the train crosses, it seems like it is crossing two river surfaces. The western end of the bridge is the Hanoi branch station, and the Hanoi main station is further beyond.</p>
<p>There is a train from Hanoi to Lang Son and Dong Dang in the early morning and at noon. The first train from Haiphong to Hanoi can connect with the train to Dong Dang that departs at noon, with a three-hour break in between, which can be used for a short tour of the city. The train departs from Hanoi, passes through Gia Lam, and then turns northeast. The entire journey is 162 kilometers. The first half is a plain, and the second half is entirely mountainous. The train travels around the mountains, winding and turning, and the scenery is quite beautiful. There are many forks in the road above Lang Gia, so a locomotive is added at the rear to cooperate with pushing and pulling. In the evening, we arrived at Lang Son, got off the train, and stayed overnight, because the market in Dong Dang is relatively poor, and food and lodging are not very convenient. Many people who work in Dong Dang still stay in Lang Son overnight, and the bus to Longzhou also departs from Lang Son, so staying in Lang Son is more appropriate.</p>
<p>4. Dong Dang, the Border Between China and Vietnam</p>
<p>The railway between Lang Son and Dong Dang was built not long ago. Passing through Dong Dang is the Pingxiang County (Zhennanguan) of Guangxi, China. Those who handle cargo transportation have specialized personnel stationed here. From Lang Son to Dong Dang, the distance is 14 kilometers. In addition to the train, there is a fixed bus service every day. The bus on the Langlong Road also passes through here. Passports for entry and exit are verified here. The verification office was originally near the customs, but it has now been moved to the border gate. After getting off the train, you have to walk a distance. Cars can go directly. When leaving Annam, the customs is more casual. Except for large quantities of goods, ordinary luggage can be exempt from inspection, but checking passports and signatures can sometimes be quite troublesome. You may have to wait an hour or two. At the same time, there are many Annamese public officials who greet you with smiling faces, asking if you have submitted your passport or if you want them to expedite the process, etc. These people are all trying to earn some change, but do not hire them, because the extent to which they can actually help is minimal. If you give one of them money, they will communicate with each other and swarm you, creating all sorts of trouble. Once the passport is verified, the exit procedure is complete. You can pass through a gate made of iron chains. From this gate to the Chinese border, there are still four kilometers, but there are no more obstacles.</p>
<p>There are two routes from Dong Dang to Gui. One is to take the Langlong Road bus to Longzhou (one round trip per day). The entire journey is 19 kilometers, and if there are no problems with passport verification and the customs at the pass in Dong Dang, it can be reached in three hours. If you need to go to Nanning, you can take the Longyong Road bus the next day. The 249-kilometer journey takes eight hours. If you depart from Lang Son or Dong Dang and want to reach Nanning in one day, you can only hire a car. Then, the 270-kilometer journey can be completed in about nine hours.</p>
<p>5. From Zhennanguan to Nanning</p>
<p>Four kilometers after the car leaves Dong Dang, you can see a wooden sign with white characters on a blue background that reads "Keep to the Left Here." This is the boundary stone between China and Vietnam. The driver must change his habit of driving on the right in Annam and switch to driving on the left. A short distance from here stands the magnificent Zhennanguan.</p>
<p>On both sides of the Zhennanguan gate, we saw various slogans for the first time, and we felt a sense of intimacy. In particular, the national flag fluttering in the wind on top of the gate tower reflected a bright color in the lush green mountains. The turret is the dormitory for the watchmen, and a sentry is watching the inside and outside of the gate with all his attention to prevent the intrusion of criminals. After the car passes through here, you must go to the Border Defense Commissioner's Office to submit your passport for signature and inspection before you can enter the gate. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Speculative Manipulation Continues Unabated, Financial Markets Still Chaotic Yesterday, Foreign Exchange Shrinks, Gold Rises, Public Bonds Fall, Various Rumors Proved False</h3>
<p>The Shanghai financial market has experienced fluctuations since last Saturday due to the creation of rumors by speculators seeking to manipulate and profit from the market. Although facts have proven the rumors to be unfounded, and the Chinese government's determination to stabilize the currency system has not changed, rumors about preparing for currency inflation in the occupied areas of Shanghai are absolutely untrue. As a result, rumors in the financial market have gradually subsided since yesterday, but speculators continue to exploit foreign exchange and gold markets with their manipulative skills, causing the financial market to remain chaotic yesterday. For example, the black market for foreign exchange continued to tighten.</p>
<p>The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, but the actual market rate for British pounds was four shillings and 0.625 pence, and the US dollar was seven yuan and 93.75 fen. The black market for gold closed at 3,840 yuan in the morning and 3,960 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The black market for securities continued to decline, with grades A, B, C, D, and E falling by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan each. The exchange discount stood between 195 yuan and 205 yuan. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Chinese government is making every effort to</p>
<p>Maintain the value and stability of the legal tender. Within areas directly controlled by the government, no problems have occurred. However, the occupied areas, especially Shanghai, face a distorted situation. The root cause lies in the mischief of villains and the fueling of speculators. As for the legal tender itself, its foundation remains sound, and it can maintain its stability even in turbulent waters.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Abnormal Development is Declining, French Newspaper Predicts Collapse in Six Months</h3>
<p>According to the French newspaper "Beijing Political News," Shanghai: Since the beginning of 1938, a very unusual artificial boom has occurred, and the reason is that refugees from various places have gathered, all bringing some savings to spend in Shanghai, and this extraordinary boom has arisen. It is said that these savings are mostly invested in various small industries, but recently,</p>
<p>Due to the continuous rise in prices, it is very difficult for these small industries to develop. According to general observations, sooner or later, these refugees' savings will be exhausted, and they will have to relocate to places with lower living costs to spend their remaining years. However, residents in the concession are already deeply aware of the</p>
<p>Pain of not being able to make ends meet. If a mass return movement breaks out, it will be unstoppable. The current congestion in the concession will inevitably have a huge reaction. According to general economic predictions, in six months, the houses in the concession, which are now fully rented, will have</p>
<p>The suffering of empty houses with no one living in them. If such a phenomenon is discovered at that time, those who remain in Shanghai will feel some comfort, but this may only be a small minority. At that time, the abnormal boom will also come to an end.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Commando Units Have Opened the Sujia Road, Guerrillas Engage Japanese in Kunshan, Situation Tense on Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to visitors from Kunshan, yesterday, a Chinese army guerrilla force of more than one hundred people encountered Japanese troops at Tianfu'an, 30 kilometers from Kunshan, and fought fiercely for several hours. Kunshan heard the sound of artillery fire. The Sujia Line has been opened by Chinese commando units, and Japanese military transportation is frequently obstructed. It is reported that the Chinese mobile units active on the Sujia Line are all equipped with the latest type of mortars and other weapons.</p>
<p>The Suburbs of Shanghai are Becoming More Active</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the New Fourth Route Army of China has arrived in areas closer to Shanghai and is showing increasing activity. It is widely believed that this is related to the second anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai battle. The Japanese military authorities claim that the Japanese garrison in Shanghai has taken the initiative to counter the infiltration of guerrillas. On August 2, battles occurred near Qingpu and Qishi. On August 3, a more intense battle occurred north of Jiading, with five Japanese soldiers injured. There were also several smaller skirmishes. The Japanese side claims to have completely controlled the situation and taken extensive precautions.</p>
<p>Traffic on Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai is Cut Off</p>
<p>Since the New Fourth Army arrived in the suburbs of Shanghai, guerrillas have been extremely active. Therefore, Japanese soldiers on Hongqiao Road are conducting stricter inspections of passengers. Yesterday morning, traffic was cut off in the area, and villagers detoured through the Great Western Road. However, it was soon reopened.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Fly Low for Reconnaissance Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>At 7:30 yesterday morning, a Japanese silver twin-engine seaplane circled back and forth over Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai for reconnaissance for half an hour before flying southwest. At 9:20, a gray bomber flew from northwest to southeast.</p>
<h3>No News of Relief for Unemployed Railway Workers</h3>
<p>A report on the 7th of this month stated that the Ministry of Railways was trying to provide relief to unemployed railway workers. A reporter from the Huawen News Agency inquired at the liaison offices of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways to find out the truth. According to a Mr. X, the responsible representative of the office, the above news was sudden. Although the office had repeatedly petitioned the Ministry to find a way, there was no overall relief plan. However, the office is almost constantly working on how to relieve and evacuate employees. Previously, it had negotiated a portion of savings and other funds, and the custodial office is currently starting to settle these accounts. If there is a surplus, the office, for the benefit of all the evacuated employees of the two railways, should negotiate to reissue it. As for the news on the 7th, it is completely fabricated.</p>
<h3>Puppet Regime Induces Foreign Ships to Register Again, Another Attempt Comes to Nothing, Using the Return of Portuguese Ships After Registration as Bait, Portuguese Merchants Ignore and Continue to Seek Diplomatic Solutions</h3>
<p>After the puppet "Weixin Government Ministry of Transportation" established a puppet "Maritime Administration Bureau" in Shanghai, in order to seize the right to manage ships and implement controlled shipping, it launched a ship registration campaign on April 1st, notifying Chinese and foreign shipping companies to register with the "Bureau" by the end of June in accordance with the "law," otherwise their ships would be prohibited from sailing and their ownership of the ships would be revoked. However, since the "August 13th" incident, all ships in Shanghai have been legally sold to countries such as Britain, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Portugal. There are almost no Chinese merchants left. General foreign merchants, because the governments of various countries do not recognize the puppet organization, have ignored the "Bureau's" notice. Now that the deadline has passed for a long time, no ships have registered, and the "Bureau's" plan has been completely shattered.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Induce Still Meets Firm Rejection</p>
<p>Since the puppet "Maritime Administration Bureau" failed because shipping companies from various countries ignored it, the puppet officials of the "Bureau" are in a very embarrassing situation. However, eager to profit, they are still unwilling to give up on this attempt. Therefore, they have repeatedly sent puppet officials, together with Japanese, to distribute registration forms to various shipping companies, inducing them to register. However, the attitudes of shipping companies from countries such as Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Norway are very firm, and they simply laugh off this move by the puppet "Bureau" and firmly reject it.</p>
<p>Coveting Portuguese Merchants, Ships Detained</p>
<p>The Japanese side previously used the excuse of unclear nationality to arbitrarily detain more than ten Portuguese merchant ships such as the Hailong, and the Portuguese Consulate General in Shanghai has repeatedly made serious representations. After four months, no solution has been reached, and the Portuguese merchants' shipping business has been completely suspended, resulting in losses. It is reported that the puppet "Maritime Administration Bureau" believes that there is an opportunity to take advantage of this and has repeatedly sent personnel to contact the companies, claiming that they can be returned after registration with the "Bureau," intending to lure them. However, the Portuguese merchants have a firm attitude and remain unmoved. In addition to continuing to request the consulate to resolve the matter through diplomatic channels, they ignore the puppet organization's encouragement. The "Bureau's" intention to covet has ultimately come to nothing.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Local Banknotes is Maximized, Tianjin-Shandong-Hankou Banknotes are Sent to the Mainland, All Other Local Banknotes are Accepted</h3>
<p>Previously, banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou were rejected by various industries, and the Shanghai market was once chaotic. After the head offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications instructed on the exchange method, the run on the banks subsided. Now, in addition to the banknotes and subsidiary currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, all other local banknotes are commonly used in the market. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>China Farmers Bank Requests Normal Acceptance</p>
<p>The China Farmers Bank sent a letter to the Silver and Money Trade Association, stating: "Dear Sirs, the banknotes issued by our bank in the names of Hangzhou, Xi'an, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, and other places, and the banknotes of the Hubei Provincial Bank reprinted by the China Farmers Bank, have long been regarded as banknotes without a specific location and are commonly used everywhere. Moreover, regardless of the amount, they can be exchanged at our branch at 609 Avenue Joffre in Shanghai at any time. We intend to request your association to forward a letter to the local firms and banks, stating that the banknotes issued by the China Farmers Bank in the names of various locations should be accepted as usual, and after being collected, they can be exchanged at our bank at any time, in order to facilitate circulation. We hereby send this letter to you, hoping that you will consider and approve it. We will be very grateful."</p>
<p>Various Banks are Maximizing Exchange</p>
<p>The four banks, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Central Bank, are maximizing the exchange of banknotes with local names, except for those from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, which are allowed to be sent to the mainland. The exchange time is from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Banknotes from various commercial banks are also exchanged by the three banks, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank: (1) The Central Bank exchanges those from the China and South Sea Bank, the China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and the Sze Ming Bank; (2) The Bank of China exchanges those from the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank; (3) The Bank of Communications exchanges those from the Zhejiang Xingye Bank, the Reclamation Bank, and the China Industrial Bank. Regarding the banknotes and subsidiary currency notes of the Zhejiang Local Bank, they can be exchanged at the Shanghai branch of the bank at 381 Jiangxi Road, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. However, subsidiary currency notes must be collected to one yuan before they can be exchanged. Subsidiary currency notes of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank (including the Xuzhou Pingshi Official Money Bureau) can be exchanged at the bank at 1182 Avenue Joffre, from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zhaofeng Park String Concert</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Music Team will hold a string concert at Zhaofeng Park on the evening of August 8th from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM (weather permitting). The program includes six items.</p>
<h3>Illegal Rice Trading Flourishes, Formal Transactions Halted, Goods Arrive Continuously by Water and Land, Medical Community Advocates Scientifically Economic Food</h3>
<p>The situation in the rice market was still very chaotic yesterday. Vendors did not display samples, and hoarders did not release goods, all adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the market was noisy. There were about twelve or thirteen boats arriving from the Riverfront yesterday. By water and land, the Tongli Songjiang gangs also loaded two or three thousand bags. Goods on the way are still arriving continuously. Furthermore, a batch of new Zhoupu indica rice arrived yesterday, about one hundred bags, which were sold in the market. Rice dealers advised their counterparts to "comply with the price limit, and even if they purchase rice above the limit, they must sell it at the door at the limit," after which the counterparts sent letters to the association, vowing not to purchase rice above the limit. However, the market is still very chaotic, and illegal transactions have not stopped. Various types of japonica rice in the market have prices but no sales. It is hoped that the Municipal Bureau will crack down on illegal transactions, dredge the source, and stabilize people's hearts.</p>
<p>Scientifically Economic Food</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao, a well-known figure in the medical community, has long studied the issue of food nutrition. According to him, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to suppress prices. Therefore, in terms of wheat consumption, one must seek the most economically healthy</p>
<h3>National Government Orders Crackdown on Illegal Armed Organizations, Using Resistance as a Pretext for Self-Interest, Colluding to Cause Trouble and Plot Evil</h3>
<p>The National Government authorities recently received reports that some unscrupulous military and political figures are using resistance as a pretext for self-interest. They claim that there are so many people and guns in a certain place who are willing to be led, but in reality, they are selling air. Once they are given a name, they collude to cause trouble, and even entice friendly troops' officers and soldiers to defect, plotting evil. A circular order has been issued to the commanders of various military regions and the provincial authorities, stating that in the future, all those who establish private names without the approval of the central government or the war zone and are suspected of swindling will be strictly cracked down on. Scientific methods, for example, instead of eating expensive white rice, why not switch to cheaper brown rice? Not only can the amount be more than white rice, but it is also rich in vitamin B, which can prevent beriberi and has a natural laxative effect. As for meat foods, they only contain a large amount of fat and protein and do not contain any vitamins. On the contrary, eating too much fat and protein often causes dangerous diseases such as kidney disease, increased blood pressure, and hardening of blood vessels in the body.</p>
<p>Vegetarian Food is More Nutritious Than Meat</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of eating expensive meat, why not switch to all plant-based foods such as soybeans, red beans, peanuts, cabbage, tomatoes, potatoes, and spinach? Not only are they cheaper than meat, but they also contain sufficient vitamins A, B, and C, which can avoid the risk of diseases in all internal organs and improve health. If all sectors can implement this, it will be of great significance to the economy, health, and the entire food problem of the people. Mr. Ding has recently written two books, "Food and Premature Aging" and "Food Therapy," advocating economically scientific food.</p>
<h3>British Ships Continue to Sail in the Lower Yangtze River, Tonghe Ship Changes to Haimen-Qidong Route, Wulin Ship Extends Route</h3>
<p>The shipping in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Xingang, Dongjie Port, Zhanghuang Port, and Zhangjiagang, is entirely controlled by special forces, so it is not easy for foreign ships to operate. Especially British merchant ships are even more envied. The situation has been repeatedly reported in the previous newspaper. Therefore, the Taikoo and Jardine ships, the Wulin and Tonghe, which operate on the route, travel empty each time. The two companies continue to operate at the expense of sacrifice. Recently, the ports on the lower Yangtze River, such as Qinglong Port and Sanhe Port, have slightly more cargo to load and unload. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. has repaired the boilers of the Tonghe, which runs the Xingang line, after returning to Shanghai on the 3rd. The work was completed yesterday, and it is scheduled to change to the Haimen-Qidong line starting this morning, working in shifts with the Yihe. The Wulin of the Taikoo Company has also extended its route. In addition to Xingang, Dongjie Port, etc., it also serves the ports on the lower Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Actually Issues Notice That Haimen Will be Blockaded Today</h3>
<p>According to news from the Japanese side, the port of Haimen in Zhejiang Province, which has been blockaded by the Japanese Navy for two months, has recently had frequent sailing ships entering and leaving. Therefore, the Japanese Navy has decided to start strictly blockading the port from noon on the 8th (noon Japanese time is 11:00 AM Chinese time), prohibiting any ships from entering or leaving. This notice was issued by the Japanese Consulate General on the morning of the 7th to the customs and the diplomatic officials of various third countries, and it was also informed to the ships of third countries and the third-country people who wish to avoid the disaster to leave the Matsuura Gate, which is equipped with dangerous objects and obstacles, before noon on the 8th, so as to avoid accidents.</p>

<h3>Cathay Hotel on Pa Li Chiao Street: Bizarre Kidnapping Case Occurs; One Person Kidnapped, One Escapes Ingeniously</h3>
<p>Yesterday around 6 PM, a bizarre kidnapping case occurred at a hotel on Pa Li Chiao Street in the French Concession. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Two travelers arrived at the Cathay Xinji Hotel, numbers 24 to 31 on Pa Li Chiao Road (i.e., West Xinqiao Street) in the French Concession, around 8 AM yesterday. Suddenly, two customers arrived, one dressed in a Western suit and the other in a Zhongshan suit. The one in the Zhongshan suit signed the register as Wang Shaowu, 36 years old, a businessman from Nanjing. The one in the Western suit only gave the surname Li. They were led to room 301 upstairs by a hotel attendant.</p>
<p>Sudden Arrival of Strange Men: After washing up briefly in the room, they went out together at 9 AM. They returned around 2 PM in the afternoon and did not go out again after that. At 6:20 PM, a brand new black-plated car (registration number 10227) suddenly drove up and stopped in front of the Cathay Hotel. Four burly men emerged from the car, two dressed in black Xiangyun gauze short outfits, one in white silk short shirt and pants, and one in a gray Zhongshan suit.</p>
<p>One Guest Escapes: After the four burly men got out of the car, they entered the Cathay Hotel, rushed upstairs, and went straight into room 301. Upon seeing Li and Wang inside, they didn't say a word and immediately helped them downstairs. Just as they were pulling the two men toward the car, intending to drag them into it, Li resisted. Wang Shaowu, seeing this, saw an opportunity and turned and ran south.</p>
<p>One Guest Kidnapped: As Wang ran towards the intersection of Caishi Street, intending to turn west, a deaf-mute beggar happened to be lingering by the roadside. Seeing Wang running in a panic, the beggar suspected that Wang was a thief and bravely stepped forward and grabbed him. Wang, seeing that the beggar was both deaf and mute and impossible to reason with, cried for help. Patrol officer number 1080 arrived and, after clarifying the situation, returned to the entrance of the Cathay Hotel, but Li, the four burly men, and the car were gone. Li had been kidnapped. The officer took Wang to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>Impacted by Japanese Interference: Trade of Various Countries Sharply Declines; Japanese Goods Imported from Occupied Ports Rank First; Accounting for Over 23% of National Import Trade</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports: After the Chinese government made efforts to adjust international trade, banning the import of non-essential goods and encouraging the export of major domestic products, it has achieved significant results. All ports in non-occupied areas have a trade surplus, but ports in occupied areas still have a trade deficit because the government's authority does not extend there. Shanghai and Tianjin ports are the most severe. All Japanese goods, as well as luxury and non-essential goods, are imported from the occupied areas. At the same time, there are anti-British and other movements in the occupied areas, greatly affecting trade between Britain, the United States, and China. Japan seeks to monopolize trade in the occupied areas. The following is a record of import trade between Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, and other countries to China in the first half of this year:</p>
<p>Britain: Imports in January were valued at 5,198,706 yuan; in February, 3,762,112 yuan; in March, 6,487,937 yuan; in April, 6,396,107 yuan; in May, 9,718,252 yuan; and in June, 7,838,612 yuan. The total is 39,500,200 yuan, accounting for 5.45% of the total national import trade, ranking sixth.</p>
<p>United States: Imports in January were valued at 12,653,980 yuan; in February, 16,593,745 yuan; in March, 18,764,871 yuan; in April, 16,844,908 yuan; in May, 25,862,314 yuan; and in June, 21,328,636 yuan. The total is 112,049,000 yuan, accounting for 15.46% of the total national import trade, ranking second.</p>
<p>Germany: Imports in January were valued at 5,890,319 yuan; in February, 4,760,447 yuan; in March, 7,671,885 yuan; in April, 8,811,997 yuan; in May, 13,043,623 yuan; and in June, 11,188,793 yuan. The total is 51,367,000 yuan, accounting for 7.09% of the total national import trade, ranking fifth.</p>
<p>Japan: Imports in January were valued at 26,710,970 yuan; in February, 19,145,642 yuan; in March, 15,531,601 yuan; in April, 27,149,486 yuan; in May, 37,272,245 yuan; and in June, 34,593,672 yuan. The total is 170,400,400 yuan, accounting for 23.51% of the total national import trade, ranking first.</p>
<p>France: Imports in January were valued at 704,346 yuan; in February, 711,688 yuan; in March, 889,799 yuan; in April, 778,911 yuan; in May, 1,174,488 yuan; and in June, 1,259,765 yuan. The total is 5,519,000 yuan, accounting for 0.76% of the total national import trade, ranking seventeenth.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Slogans Distributed in the Bailinan Road Area: Fierce Criticism of the British Shows Obvious Backing; Those Distributing Leaflets Fled into "Badlands"</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that at 9 PM last night (the 6th), three Chinese distributed leaflets fiercely criticizing "cunning and deceitful Britain" at the Five Corners intersection on Bailinan Road. This shows that the anti-British movement is rapidly spreading in China under Japanese protection. It is believed that these three Chinese are agitators distributing leaflets on public roads and near bus stops in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>When a Chinese constable tried to arrest them, the three fled into the "badlands" occupied by the Japanese army and controlled by the "Great Way Government." The leaflets were red and printed with fierce anti-British slogans, signed by the "Chinese People's Anti-British Discussion Society." The slogans are as follows: (1) Down with</p>
<p>cunning and deceitful Britain! (2) Resist British economic aggression in China! (3) Implement a complete economic break with Britain! (4) Demand the recovery of the concessions! (5) Young people in the new China must unite to resist the British! (6) Down with British imperialism, which seizes China's economic rights! (7) Unless our demands are met, we will fight the British to the end! (8) Britain is the public enemy of the East Asian national unity movement!</p>
<h3>Jewish Quarter Soon to Be Realized: 30 Million Yuan Has Been Raised Between Huade Road and Pingliang Road</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that, according to Japanese sources, the plan to establish a "Jewish Quarter" in the area between Huade Road and Pingliang Road has been approved by "relevant parties" and will soon be realized. 30 million yuan has been raised for this purpose. It is estimated that 10,000 Jewish immigrants from the Huishan area will be accommodated.</p>
<h3>Mine Deployment by Japanese Warships at Aojiangkou: Resumption of Shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou Again Obstructed</h3>
<p>After the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou was prevented because Aojiangkou was blockaded with mines by Japanese warships, the shipping industry, in order to alleviate the transportation of passengers and goods between Shanghai and Wenzhou, had requested and obtained approval from the authorities to open Pingyang Aojiang. According to reports yesterday, Aojiangkou is now also being mined by Japanese warships. To avoid danger, the shipping companies have suspended sending ships. Therefore, the resumption of shipping to Aojiang is again obstructed.</p>
<p>The Hainan Company's Yangtze River, a Japanese ship chartered to sail to Dinghai and Daishan, arrived at Dinghai Doutou on the 4th but was refused landing by the Japanese army. After much negotiation, it was finally allowed to dock the next afternoon. The ship did not have any catering facilities for passengers, causing great suffering. Subsequently, Japanese soldiers boarded the ship for inspection, and passengers without permits</p>
<p>were beaten and humiliated. The ship then returned to Shanghai. After the fall of Dinghai, the city is extremely desolate because people are hiding. Families with women are having sleepless nights. Travelers wishing to return to Dinghai should carefully consider their plans before embarking, to avoid unnecessary losses and suffering.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Issues Certificates of Domestic Goods: Can Be Processed for Shipment to the Interior and Southeast Asia Without Charge</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a letter from the Kunming Chamber of Commerce yesterday stating that goods shipped from Shanghai to Yunnan Province are often mistakenly seized due to unclear information about manufacturers, affecting the future of domestic goods production and sales. Recognizing this, in addition to providing certification from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, please provide certification from your federation for reference. We have informed the Kunming Inspection Committee and have received a reply agreeing to comply. Accordingly, we are notifying your federation for your information. In the future, if domestic goods manufacturers in Shanghai wish to ship goods to Yunnan, please provide certification to facilitate their import and avoid delays, etc. After receiving the letter, the Federation of Commerce decided that domestic goods manufacturers shipping goods to the interior and Southeast Asia can request certification from the relevant trade associations without charge.</p>
<h3>British Ship Bombed in Yichang: Report of Crew Casualties; Jiahe and Xinchanghe Ships Both Affected; Two Sailors Killed, Three Injured</h3>
<p>Jiahe, a British Jardine Matheson ship of 1,311 tons, and Xinchanghe, a ship of 617 tons, both operating on the Yichang-Chongqing line on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, have continued to operate on their original routes since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War without being significantly affected. Recently, they arrived in Yichang from Chongqing and docked at the Asiatic Petroleum Company wharf to load passengers and goods. Unexpectedly, on the early morning of the day before yesterday (the 6th), more than 20 Japanese aircraft flew over and dropped bombs. The two ships were unfortunately affected. This was reported in yesterday's news column. Yesterday, the company received a naval report on the bombing of the two ships. The bombing situation was largely the same as reported yesterday. However, it was reported that two sailors were killed and two were injured, and one important crew member was slightly injured on the hand. The company stated that it had not received detailed reports and had no further comment.</p>
<h3>Bookbinding Industry: Labor Dispute Resolved; Wage Increase of 50% Effective August 1st</h3>
<p>The citywide bookbinding workers went on strike demanding a wage increase for nearly two weeks. After several rounds of negotiations between labor and management, and with the mediation of Ma Wenlin and Wang Zhongxiao from the Political Department, an agreement was signed yesterday. A wage increase of 50% will be implemented from August 1st. It is reported that work will resume on the 7th.</p>
<h3>Adjusting Funds for Fellow Traders: Three Banks Provide Legal Tender to Banking Firms; 22 Million Yuan to Be Swapped in Installments; Sixth Installment to Be Completed on September 19th</h3>
<p>In order to adjust funds for fellow traders and assist industry and commerce, the Shanghai Banking and Money Exchange Association, in addition to handling interbank transfers and issuing transfer certificates based on market needs, has consulted with the Bank of China, Central Bank, and Bank of Communications and obtained their agreement to swap the total of 22 million yuan in transfer deposits held by various banks and firms in the banks' reserve accounts and the money exchange reserve at the end of June into legal tender at 95% starting from July 4th in twelve weeks. In addition to increasing new transfer funds, the Shanghai financial market will also increase cash funds. Regarding the swap of transfer deposits into legal tender, the first to fifth installments have already been released, totaling 9 million yuan in cash. The sixth installment, totaling 1.8 million yuan, is scheduled to be swapped today and will be completed on September 19th. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned yesterday from the Bank Association Preparation Committee that after the Committee on Inspection of Transfer Reserves was established by five groups, including the City Chamber of Commerce, the first meeting will be held in mid-September to implement the inspection, and the amounts used and the types and amounts of collateral will be announced separately to reassure the public.</p>
<h3>Owner of Egg Shop Demands Payment: Attacks Detective; Also Snatches His Pistol; Eventually Arrested and Detained in Police Station</h3>
<p>The Taichang Egg Shop at 285 Caishi Street in the French Concession is owned by businessman Chen Longhua. Lu Axiang, a Shaoxing native, is an egg vendor who has been doing business with Taichang for years. Yesterday afternoon, as Lu was riding a bicycle past the entrance of Taichang Shop, he was stopped by Chen Longhua, who demanded payment of 38 yuan. Lu said that the debt existed, but not for that amount. The two argued and were taken to the police station. The police chief said that the matter was a civil matter and was not convenient to intervene, and ordered the two to leave. After Lu left the police station, he intended to return to the Taichang Shop to retrieve his bicycle, but Chen wanted to detain the bicycle. Lu had no choice but to report to the police station again. The police chief ordered detective Wu Wengang to go to Taichang to investigate. Wu went with Lu, but the owner of Taichang, Chen Longhua, not only refused to return the bicycle, but also spoke rudely to detective Wu and ordered the shop assistants and old staff to surround and beat detective Wu, and even snatched detective Wu's pistol. Detective Wu returned to the police station to report, and the police chief immediately sent a large number of detectives to search. The scene was in the kitchen of the shop, and Wu's pistol was found. Chen, the shop assistants, and the old staff who committed the violence were arrested and detained in the police station, waiting to be sent to the Second Special District Court for trial.</p>

<h3>Do Not Injure the Functions Related to Happiness</h3>
<p>If you want to achieve consistency in love and produce excellent children to propagate offspring, the first question is to see if your physical strength is healthy. The union of men and women is originally for the exchange of love, so a healthy sexual function is nothing less than the key to opening the door to happiness between men and women.</p>
<p>If we humans all pursue the ideal of "complete detachment from the physical body as the end," then we will soon see that the environment will change greatly, and humanity will be destroyed.</p>
<p>We are, after all, one of the creatures in the biological world. Naturally, there are two major desires in the biological world: appetite and love. We should carefully observe these two major desires. Appetite must be hygienic, so why not love? Therefore, if you misuse your body or ignorantly injure the sexual functions related to happiness, it is truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>From the sweet and delicate physique of the loved one—this physique, which is the original instinct of animals, makes us love not only give birth to new life, but also expand the scope of human sympathy and increase spiritual understanding. In fact, love is the foundation of love between husband and wife, and all sources of happiness can be taken inexhaustibly and inexhaustibly from sexual power. Its potential power is indeed great.</p>
<p>Therefore, the pleasure between men and women will naturally arise after the contact of love between the two sides. Men, except for complete kidney atrophy, can fully enjoy it. It is not the same for women. If a man's energy is lost and he suffers from premature ejaculation, then the sweet dream will disappear.</p>
<p>These problems of premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy should not be indulged and must be treated. In addition to excessive self-pity and too early marriage, the reasons for suffering from these problems are due to indulgence and licentiousness after marriage and addiction to drugs. At this time, testicular endocrine therapy should be actively applied to restore the original healthy love. Speaking of this, I will use my sixteen years of clinical experience to explain the therapeutic effect of "Butiren," a true testicular essence preparation that is unanimously praised by modern physicians, on this disease.</p>
<p>"Butiren" promotes the prosperity of every cell, cultivates brain power, promotes development, and can rejuvenate the old when taken before old age. It treats premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy like wind sweeping away leaves, proving that its medicinal power can generate sperm and nourish the kidneys in a short period of time, and then the love between husband and wife can be coordinated.</p>

<h3>Health is the Mother of Success</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, MD</p>
<p>The achievement of great careers depends entirely on the soundness of one's spirit and body. Because of the soundness of the body and spirit, all actions have spirit as their backing. Those heroes who have been in the limelight, such as Mussolini and Hitler, all have the tenacity and decisiveness of spirit to achieve them. A career can be achieved. And this kind of spirit of Bi Yi, solid more out of a healthy physique. Generally speaking, people's physique is not very different, but mostly due to acquired destruction, such as excessive labor, undeveloped and self-destructing, excessive self-disrespect, early marriage, and then relying on the youth glands for development, which are suddenly hindered. Losing the foundation of health, those who suffer from incomplete lower development are mostly mentally depressed and exhausted, and their muscles are loose. Especially for young people with incomplete development, nocturnal emission, and premature ejaculation, their will is even more decadent. To want one's career to take off and prosper in this way is equivalent to trying to scoop the moon out of the water, which is absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>However, there are many famous people who were not necessarily virgins or healthy in body and spirit at first, but were able to achieve immortal careers because they were able to save themselves in time. And "Butiren" is indeed the best medicine for generally because of youth development period; excessive self-pity, early marriage, lack of self-discipline in sex, excessive hard work, etc. to lose health. Many great entrepreneurs in their early years suffered too much loss, but still regained their health with "Butiren," so that they were able to achieve the goal of establishing a great career, and also obtained the husband and wife's love, and grew old together. There are those who, in their youth or childhood, have weakened their performance in middle age, lack memory, are mentally depressed, are not interested in work, and have no career success due to self-pity, early marriage, and lack of self-discipline in sex. They can quickly take "Butiren" to save themselves. As long as they take one bottle of "Butiren," their spirit will be shaken up, their muscles will be filled, their faces will be rosy and radiant. Everything can be restored to the age of youth.</p>
<h3>One Should Come to One's Senses Early with Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Most patients with lung disease have a few light chins from time to time, or severe coughing, loss of appetite, mental depression, and weight loss, and then the symptoms of consumption become. If effective treatment can be given at this time, it can be expected to be cured radically, and the effect is easy to achieve. If it is delayed until the second or third stage of severe illness, it cannot be cured without a long period of time. Therefore, patients with lung disease should be treated as early as possible. However, it is also difficult to find an internal medicine that is suitable for treating tuberculosis, which is what I have always felt in my 20 years of clinical experience. However, since Dr. Tume of Germany invented "Bofei Naer," I have been relieved. The efficacy of "Bofei Naer" has the effect of reducing the oxygen of lung disease, and making the lung disease bacteria lose its activity. Therefore, the symptoms of tuberculosis, hemoptysis, cough, phlegm, chest pain, night sweats, and tidal fever can be cured without exception.</p>
<h3>Cure Case of Nocturnal Emission: Nocturnal Emission Due to Congenital Deficiency</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, MD from Germany</p>
<p>Patient: Wan Chengde, 20 years old. (Self-report) Because of my congenital deficiency, I have been weak and sickly since I was a child. In addition, due to the lack of coordination after the illness, my body is so weak that I cannot bear it. I had nocturnal emission when I was 17 years old. Although I took medicine for treatment at that time, it was not effective at all. Now, nocturnal emission occurs frequently, development is incomplete, and the genitals are no different from those of a child. In addition, I have weak brain and insomnia, so I came here for treatment. (Cure process) I told him to take nutritious food, gave him "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to stop nocturnal emission, and also took the German male "Butiren" three times a day to supplement it. After three months of treatment, nocturnal emission has stopped, and development has been completely restored.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission Injured by Self-Pity</h3>
<p>Patient: Ling Qihai, 23 years old. (Self-report) In his early years, he was harmed by erotic books and committed the bad habit of self-pity. He did it every night, and his essence and blood were greatly depleted. After half a year, he had nocturnal emission. Because he did not receive treatment, the condition gradually deteriorated. Now, he ejaculates when he sees color, his brain is weak and unconscious, and he is in extreme pain. (Cure process) Daily electrotherapy for 15 minutes, taking a large amount of "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" and "Butiren," and treated for more than three months, his health gradually recovered.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Symposium</p>
<h3>Do Not Be Sad About Joy Causing Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Said by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road, No. 9</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people who suffer from gonorrhea come into contact with unclean prostitutes. Therefore, some people say that this is the result of joy causing sorrow. But I don't know that these kinds of sorrows cannot be relieved. Because now, due to scientific progress, this kind of difficult-to-treat gonorrhea has been conquered by science, and this kind of leucorrhea, which has always been regarded as a magic disease, has finally been completely and fundamentally solved.</p>
<p>However, in my more than 20 years of experience, there are not a few patients who cannot escape the poisonous claws of this disease demon for the rest of their lives and wait for death in disgust. In this way, wouldn't it be that once you get gonorrhea, you will never be able to enjoy the pleasure of health? Is it true that one moment of romance is a hundred years of regret? In fact, this is not necessarily the case. Because these people mistakenly believe in generally exaggerated advertisements and say that one or two bottles and one or two treatments can completely cure the disease. This is really beyond reason and is tens of thousands of miles away from science. To sum up, the treatment of gonorrhea focuses on practice, not on verbal and written propaganda, which has nothing to do with actual gonorrhea. The reason why general patients often fall into a pessimistic situation is probably because they are misled by those therapies that are far from scientific facts. Based on my actual clinical experience of more than 20 years, a precise diagnosis should be made first, and then a proper treatment method should be determined. For patients to cause pessimism about gonorrhea, the sequelae of chronic gonorrhea are a bad omen. Its toxins spread throughout the body. At this time, German anti-gonorrhea blood serum should be used, and special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinong" should be taken internally to make the whole body cells completely develop an anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effect, then all the gonorrhea bacteria hidden in the depths will be completely eradicated, but it also takes three to five weeks to cure. Many pessimists of gonorrhea often take "Kelinong" and are completely cured. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. From today, 20 numbers will be sent for diagnosis every day, and each number will only cost 50 cents. A copy of "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth 1 yuan will also be given.</p>
<h3>First Peak of Autumn Flood: Huangpu River Tide Will Reach the Shore</h3>
<p>The high tide of Shanghai's Huangpu River is set to officially begin on the 15th of this month. At that time, the tide will reach the shore along the river, which is a matter of great concern.</p>
<p>Beginning of Autumn Flood</p>
<p>According to a report from the Datong News Agency, autumn officially begins on the 8th of this month. The first high tide of this year will occur on the 15th of this month and the high tide on the 17th may even exceed the height of the Bund embankment. Therefore, the tide will flood the shore, causing a considerable amount of water damage.</p>
<p>First High Tide</p>
<p>The first autumn flood high tide will last for a week starting on the 15th of this month. The time and quantity of the tide have been measured by the Hydraulics Department of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau. The tide at 12:00 AM on the 15th is estimated to be 11 feet 7 and a half inches, and the tide at 12:50 PM will be 10 feet 5 inches.</p>
<p>Most Noteworthy</p>
<p>The tide will continue to rise. The tide at 12:46 AM on the 16th will be 12 feet 4.4 inches, and the tide at 1:31 PM will be 11 feet 8 inches. The tide at 1:30 AM on the 17th is the most noteworthy, reaching 13 feet 1.5 inches, and the tide at 2:10 PM will be 11 feet 7 inches.</p>
<p>Large Volume of Water</p>
<p>The water level will also be high starting on the 18th. The tide at 2:14 AM will be 12 feet 8 inches, and the tide at 2:49 PM will be 11 feet 9 inches. The tide at 3:00 AM on the 19th will be 12 feet 4 inches, and the tide at 3:26 PM will be 11 feet 7.4 inches.</p>
<p>Total of Seven Days</p>
<p>Starting on the 20th, the water volume will drop slightly. The tide at 3:38 AM will be 12 feet 1 inch, and the tide at 4:07 PM will be 11 feet 5.5 inches. The tide at 4:20 AM on the 21st will be 10 feet 5.5 inches, and the tide at 5:00 PM will be 10 feet 6.5 inches. The above totals seven days.</p>
<p>Tide Will Inevitably Reach the Shore</p>
<p>The height of the Bund embankment is only 13 feet. Compared to the tide on the 17th, the height will exceed the embankment by 1.5 inches. The tide will inevitably flood the land. If there are strong winds and rain, the water problems Shanghai will face will be even more concerning. During the high tide period, water accumulation in the low-lying areas of the roads is inevitable.</p>

<h3>Forced to Death Over Gambling Debts at a Flower Game</h3>
<p>Xia Desheng, a local resident, 34 years old, ran a tobacco and paper store at 62 Zhujia Ku, Route Haig. Yesterday, Xia's son (14 years old) had a strange dream the previous night, so he secretly took money to place a bet at the Helihua flower game listening booth at number 8. He happened to win, and was supposed to receive 91 yuan in winnings. However, the gambling den cheated him because he was a child and refused to pay him a cent. Xia's son then went home and told his father. Xia went with him to negotiate, but the den owner, Kong Wenbao, threatened him and ordered his gang members to beat Xia severely. In the end, he even ordered Xia to pay 500 yuan as compensation for his reputation and had to apologize in public. Xia, with his small business, was forced under duress and returned home in tears. Yesterday morning at around 3 AM, he secretly took poison and committed suicide. Afterwards, his family took him to the Red Cross Hospital, but he died before he could be saved. The police are paying close attention to the case and are strictly pursuing the perpetrators. (Social News Agency)</p>

The police reported the case to verify the body and handed it over to his family for burial.</p>
<h3>Prostitute Defrauded of Huge Sum; Silk Store Owner Detained; Embezzled 80,000-90,000 Yuan Indulged in Gambling Dens; Claimed Speculation Failure, Not Fraud</h3>
<p>Gao Zhenyi, a native of Hangzhou, 29 years old, currently residing at 126 Zhaofeng Villa, Brenan Road, Shanghai, is the son of Gao Ziyan, the owner of the famous Shanghai-Hangzhou Gaoyitai Silk Store. Because of his wealthy family, Gao Zhenyi frequented brothels, and several years ago became acquainted with the famous Shanghai prostitute Wen Di Lao Si Ying Huizhen (i.e., the madam of the Wen Di brothel at 233 Wuling Lane, Guangxi Road). Since the outbreak of the war, Hangzhou fell, and Gao moved his family to Shanghai. Thus, Gao Zhenyi and Wen Di Lao Si became even closer. Gao knew that Lao Si had quite a bit of savings, and that women are naturally eager to seek profits. So, in the autumn of last year, he suddenly told Lao Si that he was planning to gather a large amount of capital to purchase cotton, salt, rice, and other goods in the interior, transport them to Shanghai for sale, and would definitely make a substantial profit. He asked her if she was interested in investing. Wen Di Lao Si</p>
<p>was deceived by his business talk and believed that Gao was the son of a wealthy family and would have no other intentions. She successively paid Gao more than 40,000 yuan in cash and 43 diamonds worth 2,200 yuan as capital. At the same time, Wen Di Lao Si also persuaded her acquaintance Mrs. Wu (i.e., the wife of Wu Zishen, who lived at 154 Xianglin Lane, Weihaiwei Road, and was recently kidnapped) to invest 2,000 yuan, Xu Loushi (who lived at 2 Anle Village, Avenue Foch) to invest 9,000 yuan, Gu Guoying (who lived at 109 Jiaoming Village, Avenue Foch) to invest 3,000 yuan in cash and two diamond rings worth 8,100 yuan, and Zhang Xiuzhen (who lived at 5 Ping'an Lane, Route Cardinal Foch) to invest in a Shanghai Bank</p>
<p>passbook with a balance of 15,000 yuan and 2,000 yuan in cash, for a total of no less than 80,000 to 90,000 yuan that Wen Di Lao Si handed over to Gao. However, after obtaining the money, Gao did not engage in the so-called cotton, salt, and rice business. Instead, he used the money to frequent gambling dens such as Hollywood, Qiuyue, and Caojiabo Rongsheng Company on Yuyuan Road. Over the months, he spent most of it. He also suffered losses from dealing in daily gold bills and drafts, exhausting all the money he had swindled. To Wen Di and the others, he claimed that the goods and rice had not arrived or paid some interest as a stopgap measure. It was not until now that Wen Di Lao Si</p>
<p>realized that she had been defrauded and reported it to the Old Gate Police Station. Chinese Detective Pang Ruiqing, Jia Huijun, and Detective Cao Qishan investigated Gao's whereabouts. Yesterday morning at 1:30 AM, when Gao left gambling dens such as Hollywood and Qiuyue on Yuyuan Road and passed Yidingpan Road, he was apprehended by the detectives. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu briefly presented the case, stating that the case still needed to be investigated. Therefore, he requested permission to detain him temporarily for investigation. When questioned, Gao claimed that the money was borrowed because of the failure of the Xinhua Silver Company he operated on Jiangxi Road, not fraud. Judge Fang Qinghuan verified the confession and ordered Gao Zhenyi to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Paper Package of Banknotes Robbed</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 3:30 PM, a middle-aged man on Jiangxi Road was carrying a paper package under his arm, walking north to south. When he passed the intersection of Beijing Road, he was suddenly stopped by two robbers. One of the robbers displayed a handgun and ordered him not to make a sound. He then snatched the paper package from the man's arm and fled. The victim immediately called for help, but the robbers had already gone far away and could not be caught. He reported the incident to the police station and revealed that the paper package contained 1,200 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang People in Shanghai Commemorate Mao Sicheng</h3>
<p>The late Mao Mianlu of Fenghua, a member of the National Government Supervisory Yuan, was renowned in eastern Zhejiang for his moral character and literary accomplishments. This year, he was recuperating in his hometown when he suddenly passed away. Zhejiang people in Shanghai were saddened by the news. In the past, Mao served as the principal of Zhejiang Fourth Middle School and Seventh Middle School. His former students residing in Shanghai held a public memorial ceremony yesterday (the 6th) morning at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association. The ceremony was solemn, and the music was mournful.

They were placed in locations such as the YMCA to raise funds for leprosy relief.</p>
<h3>Ordered Cotton Yarn from Japanese Merchant Mill; Salesman Embezzled Through Fraud; Squandered Over Ten Thousand Yuan Twice in Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>Xi Wenguang (also known as Huan Zuocai), a native of Changzhou, 21 years old, worked as a salesman at the Qiuxing Yarn Mill at 406 Jiangxi Road. On April 17 of this year, he was ordered by the store owner to purchase 100 bales of July cotton yarn from the Gongji Yarn Company at 6 Tongde Lane, Zhilan Street, and paid a 5% deposit of 2,500 yuan. Afterwards, Xi</p>
<p>order form</p>
<p>handed over to the store owner. On June 1, Xi was given a check from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank by the owner, instructing him to order 300 bales of cotton yarn from the Tongxing Yarn Mill. Xi also handed over the order form to the store. The Gongji Yarn Company and Tongxing Yarn Mill order forms given by Xi to the store were stolen, and the</p>
<p>seal</p>
<p>of Gongji Yarn Company and the private seal of Terauchi Kogao, the Japanese person in charge of Tongxing, were forged and stamped on them. In reality, he did not order cotton yarn from the above two companies, but embezzled the 12,500 yuan deposit and deposited it in banks such as the Jiaotong Bank. Then every night he went to the Hollywood gambling den on Yuyuan Road and the Rongsheng Company and other gambling dens</p>
<p>gamble wildly</p>
<p>and frequently went to the major dance halls, lavishing money on his favorite dancers. As a result, in less than a month or two, he had exhausted his funds. There were only a few dozen yuan left in the bank. On August 1, when the store owner went to Gongji and Tongxing to pick up the goods, he discovered that the two order forms were forged. He reported it to the General Police Station. Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Cheng Renkun</p>
<p>arrested</p>
<p>Xi on the 6th. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the process. Because further investigation was needed, he requested permission to postpone the hearing. Xi also hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he was ordered to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>According to China News Agency, the recent lawsuit involving Jingli Primary School and a mother and son has caused a stir in society. The school was established by Zhang Ziying of Zhenhai and has been in existence for nearly 30 years. In the summer of the 25th year, Zhang passed away, and the school board appointed Shui Xiangyun as the principal. After the Shanghai war, Principal Shui left Shanghai for personal reasons, and the school affairs were taken over by Zhang's adopted son, Zhang Fuhua,</p>
<p>who called himself the principal. Zhang Fuhua was an abandoned child that Zhang's wife found in the alley. Zhang's wife had no children and loved him more than her own. However, Zhang considered him to be of inferior character since childhood and repeatedly tried to drive him out, but was dissuaded by his mother. Unexpectedly, after Zhang's death, Fuhua treated his mother with disrespect, and his words and actions were rude. Friends and relatives tried to persuade him, but were also rejected. Instead, he hired lawyer Chen Mao Yi to draft a contract stipulating that all administrative powers of the school</p>

<h3>Pacific Hurricane Dissipated, Strange Clear Sky Thunderbolt</h3>
<p>Two newly formed hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean have dissipated. There are no signs of any hurricanes continuing to form in the Pacific Ocean. Yesterday's weather was clear and sunny, with rain at noon, but it soon stopped. Yesterday, on the 4th of this month, at 3:00 PM, a thunderbolt was suddenly heard in the clear sky. Although it only lasted for one strike, the old farmers were discussing that this year's autumn harvest would likely be reduced, and some said it would also affect the health of residents, because thunder in clear weather is a sign of epidemic prevalence. However, this saying is difficult to believe. The weather anomaly is rare.</p>

<h3>Blocking North Jiangxi Road, Westerner Jumps to Suicide, Relying on Rent to Maintain Family, Forced to Relocate, Sudden Economic Hardship</h3>
<p>Liang Luanjie, a young Cantonese man working as a clerk in the engineering department on the third floor of the British Taikoo Yanghang on the Bund in the French Concession, was 20 years old and had been employed for over a year. His monthly salary was only 15 yuan. His family lived in a certain house in Taihua Lane on North Jiangxi Road. The house belonged to Liang's second landlord, who subleased the remaining rooms to others, earning dozens of gold yuan per month to supplement the family's income, which was enough to make ends meet. However, recently the North Jiangxi Road area was designated as a restricted area, blocking the various lanes in the area, and all residents were forced to relocate. Liang was struck by this blow like a bolt from the blue. The entire family had to move elsewhere. With a family of seven, Liang's meager income was unable to support his family. After thinking about it repeatedly, he found it impossible to survive and decided to commit suicide. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:45 PM, he jumped from the roof of the firm, landing at the entrance of the firm, injuring his head and brain, and blood flowed like a spring. The nearby police arrived and urgently summoned an ambulance to Renji Hospital. However, due to excessive blood loss, he died on the way before he could be treated. It is reported that the deceased had written a suicide note to his family, the contents of which were very tragic.</p>
<p>Also, it was reported that Liang Luanjie, a 26-year-old Cantonese man without a family, had been working as a clerk at Yanghang Taikoo, 22 Huangpu Beach, French Concession for nearly two years. Recently, due to limited income, which was insufficient for personal expenses, he became tired of life. Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, in the office of the firm, he wrote a death note at his desk, and then went to the roof on the fifth floor to take Lysol poison to commit suicide. After taking the poison, he lay on the roof waiting for the arrival of the god of death. However, by 3:30 p.m., Liang, although poisoned, was still conscious, and seeing that he had not achieved his goal of immediate death, he jumped from the roof on the fifth floor and fell to the ground, injuring his head and falling into a coma. Passers-by saw it and reported it to Taikoo Yanghang, who reported it to the French Police Department, who sent detectives to investigate.

<h3>Jiangsu Province Middle Schools Resuming Classes in Shanghai, Measures for Accepting Transfer Students, Education Department Answers Three Difficult Questions</h3>
<p>(Taixian Communication) The Jiangsu Education Department recently issued an order to provincial secondary schools, stating that according to the reports from various public and private secondary schools resuming classes in Shanghai, the following difficulties have been encountered when enrolling transfer students: (1) Can transfer students be admitted to the third year of senior and junior high school? (2) Can students from unregistered private schools be accepted when they request to transfer? (3) Can students who have withdrawn from puppet schools in guerrilla areas and come to Shanghai for education be accepted? The following measures are proposed: (1) Transfer and temporary study for senior and junior high school students, in accordance with Article 10 of the "Measures for Transfer and Temporary Study of Students in Schools at All Levels in War Zones" promulgated by the Ministry of Education, are not limited to grade level, but must enroll at the beginning of the academic year or semester. (2) According to Article 7 of the "Measures for Issuing Certificates by Schools in War Zones" promulgated by the Ministry of Education, "graduation certificates and graduation certificates issued by unregistered private secondary schools and below are invalid." Students from unregistered private schools should not be admitted when they request to transfer. (3) For students who have withdrawn from puppet schools in guerrilla areas and come to Shanghai for education, each school should inquire in detail and strictly examine them. If they are indeed brave enough to extricate themselves and there is evidence of remorse, they may be admitted at their discretion. However, any certificates or proof issued by puppet schools should be deemed invalid. Each student should be required to participate in a grade placement test based on their original educational qualifications. Those who pass the test will be allowed to enroll in the corresponding grade for study. The above items should be followed.</p>
<h3>Overview of Unified Enrollment of National Colleges and Universities in the 27th Academic Year (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Students Exempt from Examination</p>
<p>In the 27th academic year, in addition to the unified examination, the Ministry of Education formulated measures for exemption from examination for outstanding students in the high school joint examinations held by various provinces and cities this year, and for graduates of national high schools, in accordance with the outline of the unified enrollment method. The number of outstanding students from various provinces recommended for joint examinations is limited to the top 15% of students who pass the high school joint examination. The number of graduates from national high schools recommended for exemption from examination is limited to those who have graduated with honors (Grade A). The students recommended for exemption from examination by various provinces and national high schools shall be reviewed by the Unified Enrollment Committee of the Ministry of Education and assigned according to the students' wishes. If the number of students admitted to the desired school through the examination is too large, the number of students admitted without examination shall not exceed 15% of the total number of admissions. The number of students recommended by various provinces and national high schools and approved by the Ministry of Education is as follows: Shaanxi Middle School 6, Henan Middle School 3, Sichuan Middle School 29, Guizhou Middle School 20, Gansu Middle School 6, Northeast Middle School 13, Guangxi Province 29, Sichuan Province 103, Hubei Province 105, Jiangxi Province 51, Gansu Province 6, Guizhou Province 4, Yunnan Province 6, totaling 401. Except for 5 students in Sichuan Province and 53 students in Hubei Province who have not completed the procedures and have been temporarily delayed in their assignment, the remaining 343 students have been assigned to various schools. The Central University has the largest number of students assigned, with 74, followed by the Southwest Associated University with 52 and the Northwest Institute of Technology with 51. The schools with the fewest number of students assigned are Guiyang Medical College and National Normal College, with 1 each. By category, 244 students are in science and engineering, 78 in liberal arts, and 21 in normal education. Among them, engineering is the most numerous, with 170, and business is the least, with only 2.</p>
<p>The unified entrance examination for national colleges and universities was held simultaneously in 12 locations, including Wuchang, Changsha, Ji'an, Guangzhou, Guilin, Guiyang, Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanzheng, Yanping and Yongkang. As for the issue of high school graduates in Shanghai, in addition to studying at the various schools currently located in Shanghai, there must be many students who wish to enter universities in the rear. In order to facilitate the admission of students from Shanghai, the Ministry of Education has decided to adopt measures for national colleges and universities in Shanghai to recruit new students on behalf of national colleges and universities in the rear. Jiaotong University, Jinan University, and Shanghai Medical University will recruit new students on behalf of national colleges and universities in the rear while recruiting new students for their own colleges. The Ministry of Communications on behalf of recruiting freshmen in three colleges of science, engineering and agriculture, Jinan University on behalf of recruiting freshmen in four colleges of liberal arts, law, science and business, Shanghai Medical College on behalf of recruiting freshmen in the medical college, students who are admitted to national colleges and universities in the rear will be exempt from tuition fees. After the examination, the Ministry of Education will review the scores of the candidates. It is estimated that 270 students will be recruited on behalf of the university, including 45 from Jiaotong University, 195 from Jinan University, and 30 from Shanghai Medical College. Yunnan University has the largest number of students assigned, with 65, and Sichuan University has the fewest, with 5. Comparing the departments to which students are assigned, science and engineering account for 182, liberal arts account for 49, and normal education accounts for 39.</p>
<p>The unified enrollment situation for the 27th academic year is roughly as described above. To sum up the results: (1) It eliminates the suffering of students from repeatedly taking examinations for schools. This is very important in peacetime, and is certainly necessary in wartime. (2) The total number of admissions for unified enrollment is relatively large. If the applicant's performance is satisfactory, they can be admitted. Even if their desired school is already full, they can still be assigned to other schools, reducing the difficulty of not being able to go to school. (3) Admitted students can be reasonably distributed to various colleges and universities, which is sufficient to realize the predetermined goals of educational administration and improve the efficiency of education. The first unified enrollment has achieved the above three points. However, it was the first time it was held, and the preparation time was very rushed. The test method may not be thorough. How to improve it is being researched and planned by the Ministry of Education. In the future, it is planned to add provincial colleges and universities, and will also be held, a unified enrollment for national, provincial and private colleges above the vocational level, and gradually a unified enrollment will be carried out.</p>

<h3>Finance: Speculation and Large-Scale Covering, Foreign Exchange Tightening Continues, British Exchange Breaks 4 Shillings, US Dollar 7.625 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first Monday of August. It was a bank holiday in England as usual, and Hong Kong was also closed. Foreign banks in this city were open as usual, as they had moved the holiday to Confucius' birthday on August 27th. In the foreign exchange market, both the exchange rate and the listed price did not fluctuate. In the black market for British and American exchange, the market was initially stable and strong because the yarn and silk merchants were selling, and the Japanese banks continued to sell. Later, Chinese speculators suddenly came to cover their positions, and foreign firms also settled accounts, causing the market to turn soft. However, the midday close for British and American exchange was similar to the morning opening. After the close, the situation tightened as speculators continued to cover. In the afternoon, the speculation of speculators and foreign firms such as Xinfeng and Hesheng became more intense, and Japanese banks such as Zhenjin also suddenly came to buy. In addition, the Hong Kong speculators telegraphed to buy and settle accounts. HSBC was initially willing to supply settlement, but soon reversed to absorb, so the situation lacked support and continued to soften. By the late close, the unprecedentedly tight price of 3 shillings and 9.0625 pence for British gold and 7.625 yuan for US dollars had been created, breaking the historical tight record of 4 shillings and 7.75 yuan for US dollars on the 21st of last month. The futures situation for this month also followed, first flattening and then tightening. Finally, British continued to tighten by 1.5625, and the US dollar was more expensive by 0.25. Because the difference between the spot and this month was not large, arbitrage disappeared, and the current period transaction was still strong.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants First Sell and Then Aggressively Buy</p>
<p>In the early morning, the long and short positions for London's major strips were both up 0.125, New York's silver was closed, the London spot gold was still flat, the exchange rate for British against US and against French were both flat, against Shanghai small 0.1875, the central government listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 shillings and 0.09375 pence for British gold and 7.9375 yuan for US dollars, with no changes from the midday close last Saturday. After opening, the Chinese yarn and silk merchants suddenly came to sell, making the situation quite stable. It is estimated that the foreign banks such as Hua Bi were given the spot price of 4 shillings and 0.125 pence for British gold, and the spot price of 8 yuan for the US dollar. When HSBC announced the listed price, there were no changes, and the silver balance tax was still waived. After that, the Japanese banks also came to sell, and the Chinese merchants still had intentions to sell, so the market was strong. It is estimated that the Japanese banks sold the spot price of 4 shillings and 0.125 pence for British gold to the foreign banks. At the same time, they also successively sold the spot prices of 8 yuan and 8.03125 yuan for the US dollar to the US banks such as Datong. At that time, the British banks were profitable by absorbing the US dollar at 7.75 yuan for this month from the peer banks. Later, the Chinese speculators suddenly stopped selling and began to buy, and foreign firms also settled accounts slightly, so the market turned soft. It is estimated that the speculators settled the US dollar at 7.6875 yuan for this month at Datong. Then they bought the spot prices of 7.9375 yuan for the US dollar from the foreign banks such as Maigali. After that, they bought the spot prices of 4 shillings and 0.09375 pence and 0.0625 pence for British gold from Maigali and Hua Bi. It was already noon. The bank's midday close spot selling price was 4 shillings and 0.09375 pence for British gold and 7.9375 yuan for US dollars. The British gold for this month was 3 shillings and 9.375 pence, and the US dollar was 7.625 yuan. It was heard that after the close, the British gold softened to 4 shillings and 0.03125 pence, and the US dollar also tightened to 7.875 yuan.</p>
<p>HSBC Absorbs in the Afternoon</p>
<p>In the after-market, foreign firms frequently came to buy and settle accounts, and the market became tighter. It is estimated that the foreign firms settled the spot price of 4 shillings for British gold at HSBC. After that, Japanese banks such as Zhenjin and Chinese merchants and yarn and silk merchants also competed to aggressively buy. In addition, Hong Kong speculators also telegraphed to buy and settle accounts. In addition, HSBC stopped supplying and instead absorbed, so the situation became tighter. British gold immediately broke into the 4 shillings. It is estimated that Japanese banks such as Zhenjin, Hong Kong, and Chinese merchants settled the spot price of 3 shillings and 9.375 pence for British gold from foreign banks such as Youli, and the spot prices of 7.75 yuan and 6.875 yuan for the US dollar. At that time, HSBC absorbed the British gold at 3 shillings and 8.125 pence for this month from the peer banks. Later, a certain bank sold the US dollar at 7.375 yuan for this month to the Chinese merchants. After entering, foreign firms such as Hesheng and Xinfeng also bought the spot price of 7.6875 yuan for the US dollar from the British banks and Youli. By the late close, the bank's spot selling price was 3 shillings and 9.0615 pence for British gold and 7.625 yuan for US dollars. The British gold for this month was 3 shillings and 75 pence, and the US dollar was 7.3125 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous weekend, the spot price of British continued to tighten by 0.1875, and the US dollar softened by 0.3125. The British gold for this month tightened by 1.5825, and the US dollar was more expensive by 0.25.</p>
<h3>No Large Supply of Foreign Exchange, Gold Approaching 4,000 Yuan Mark Again, Still More Than 600 Yuan Lower if Calculated by British and American Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the black market for cash sycee, the price fluctuated around 3,800 yuan due to people's confusion and constant buying and selling. At one point, it fell to a low of 3,775 yuan. The midday close, however, had already recovered to a high of 3,840 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation suddenly tightened due to the lack of foreign exchange maintenance. British gold actually broke into the 4 shilling mark, stimulating buying sentiment. Non-professional buyers also flocked to the market. In addition, a foreign firm also came to search for purchases. The selling side's willingness to supply suddenly diminished. The rising trend exploded again, breaking the 3,900 yuan mark. At one point, it reached a high of 3,970 yuan, nearing the 4,000 yuan mark. It finally closed at 3,960 yuan, a sharp increase of 105 yuan compared to last weekend. If calculated by the late close domestic settlement price of British gold, it would be 4,550 yuan, and the US dollar would be 4,605.7 yuan, more than 600 yuan higher than the above price. This is because some wealthy merchants have a stronger psychological preference for storing foreign exchange than gold due to the recent complex international situation. Transaction was brisk today, with over a thousand taels changing hands. Jewelry gold was finally listed at 10 yuan higher. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Sycee Rises by 105 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), the market was initially slightly fatigued, and it was heard that foreign exchange was quite stable. The opening price was 55 yuan lower than last weekend's midday close. Qian Dui Ye sold 20 taels to Jin Hao at a price of 3,800 yuan. Then it fell another 10 yuan. A Jin Hao sold 10 taels to a certain Jin Hao at a price of 3,790 yuan. Although a certain Jin Hao stopped selling and started selling, the Qian Dui Ye's appetite was very strong, and the market rebounded. Soon, it returned to 40 yuan higher. Qian Dui Ye bought 10 taels from a certain Jin Hao at a price of 3,830 yuan. A certain Jin Hao then turned to buying and aggressively absorbed dozens of taels, causing the price to rise. A certain Jin Hao bought 20 taels from the securities firm at a price of 3,847 taels. The securities firm then came to sell again, and a certain Jin Hao also suddenly came to sell, and the market became fatigued again, plunging 72 yuan. Qian Dui Ye sold 10 taels to Jin Hao at a price of 3,775 yuan, which was the low of the day. At that time, retail investors took advantage of the low price to absorb quite strongly, causing the price to rebound. Before long, it rebounded 37 yuan. Qian Dui Ye bought 20 taels from the silverware firm at a price of 3,812 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was declining, and buyers were more eager to buy. A certain Jin Hao aggressively absorbed dozens of taels, buying 10 taels from a cash firm at a price of 3,830 yuan. Then, they bought 50 taels from peer firms at 3,835 yuan. Later, the securities firm bought 10 taels from the silverware firm, closing the midday at 3,840 yuan. In the afternoon, because British gold in the foreign exchange market was approaching the 4 shilling mark, the buying sentiment was quite strong. The opening price rose sharply by 40 yuan. A certain Jin Hao bought 10 taels from Qian Dui Ye at a price of 3,880 yuan. At that time, Qian Dui Ye absorbed and bought aggressively, breaking through the 3,900 yuan mark. Qian Dui Ye bought 30 taels from a cash firm at a price of 3,910 yuan. Later, the silverware firm came to sell slightly, and the price fell back temporarily. The silverware firm sold 20 taels to a certain Jin Hao at a price of 3,880 yuan. After that, it was heard that British gold in the foreign exchange market had broken into the 4 shilling mark, and the buying sentiment became even stronger. A certain silver firm and Qian Dui Ye and others competed to aggressively buy, and the price soared another 90 yuan. Qian Dui Ye bought 20 taels from the silverware firm at a price of 3,970 yuan. Later, a certain Jin Hao and the securities firm suddenly sold off at the high price, and the price immediately fell back by 55 yuan. Qian Dui Ye sold 10 taels to Jin Hao at a price of 3,915 yuan. After entering, because the foreign exchange market showed no signs of recovery, it closed at the tightest price of the day. A certain silver firm and retail investors and others started to buy again, and the price rose sharply to 3,970 yuan, the high of the day. After 2:20 PM, because Qian Dui Ye sold off for profit, it fell back slightly. Qian Dui Ye mutually made 20 taels at 3,960 yuan, closing the evening. As a result, it rose another 105 yuan compared to last Saturday, and it has risen for three consecutive rounds, totaling 360 yuan. It was heard that after the close, a certain Qian Dui Ye sold 20 taels to peer firms and another 50 taels to a certain silver firm for profit, both at a price of 3,970 yuan. The entire day fluctuated by 195 yuan. The cash firm's original brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the sycee. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, it was rarely heard of being traded.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Hangs High at 400 Yuan</p>
<p>Silverware and jewelry gold, the exchange price per tael, was initially still listed at 390 yuan by Da Tong Hang. At 9:30 AM, it listed 5 yuan lower, at 10:00 AM, it returned 5 yuan higher, at 10:15 AM, it listed 5 yuan lower again, at 12:10 PM, it returned 5 yuan higher, at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it listed 5 yuan higher, at 2:35 PM, it listed 5 yuan higher again. After that, there were no changes. As a result, it increased by 10 yuan. It is estimated that Da Tong Hang changed the listing to 400 yuan, and the new Hang was 398 yuan. The purchase price was generally 20 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency High Peaks Seen Frequently, British Gold Pound 94.5 Yuan, US Dollar Sells for 98 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies were weak due to the weakening of foreign exchange. The British exchange has broken the four-shilling mark, and the sycee black market is trading at 4,020 yuan. The supply of British and American gold pounds is extremely scarce, and the market is very firm. British and American gold tickets are in even greater demand, and the price is rising sharply. They are rarely circulated in the market and are not easy to obtain. Hong Kong French franc tickets are all regarded as treasures. Canadian tickets and Philippine tickets, etc., are following the sharp rise. Australian gold tickets rose by 3 yuan. The black market is unstable. Foreign currency peaks are appearing in succession. The impact of Japanese gold tickets is quite small. The late market price was 1 yuan, 0.9 points and 2 li. The late market price for Korean tickets was 9 jiao. Trading in the association was not smooth. Qin Tai sold 10 pounds of British gold tickets, Wan Kang sold 50 US dollar tickets, and Yi Kang sold 150 US dollar tickets, all of which were purchased by Sen Tai. Also, Bao Da sold 200 US dollar tickets which were bought by Rentai. Yesterday's market prices: British and American pounds each rose by 1 yuan, British gold tickets rose by 2 yuan, US dollar tickets rose by 0.54 yuan, Hong Kong tickets rose by 0.1 yuan, French franc tickets rose by 0.019 yuan, Singapore tickets rose by 0.1 yuan, Swiss tickets rose by 0.15 yuan, Canadian tickets rose by 0.2 yuan, Philippine tickets rose by 0.3 yuan, Italian tickets rose by 0.02 yuan, Australian gold tickets rose by 3 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Banking Association Notice: Accepting Out-of-Town Banknotes from the China Farmers Bank</h3>
<p>Since the city stopped using banknotes with place names from Tianjin, Shandong, Hubei, other out-of-town banknotes have also been refused, and disputes have often occurred in the market. Small money shops and silver shops use the exchange of out-of-town banknotes as a business, and advertise in newspapers. This newspaper argues that the issuing bank should publish a notice in the newspaper stating that they are all universally accepted, and send a letter to the Silver and Money Industries Association to circulate to all banks and shops to accept them uniformly, which is the right way. As reported previously, it is now learned that the Shanghai Banking Association yesterday sent a letter to its member banks, stating that "The China Farmers Bank has requested that the banknotes issued by the bank with the place names of Hangzhou, Xi'an, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, and other places, and the banknotes reprinted by the Hubei Provincial Bank, all be treated as banknotes without place names. Regardless of the amount, they can be exchanged for legal tender at the bank at any time. It is hoped that all member banks in the city will accept them uniformly to facilitate circulation." After the Association circulated the letter, all banks have accepted them. If the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications can also follow the China Farmers Bank's approach, then the circulation of out-of-town banknotes in this city will not be a problem. (M)</p>
<h3>Issue of Stopping Payment on Bank Drafts: A Banker's Perspective</h3>
<p>Recently, a dispute arose in Shanghai's financial circles regarding the stopping of payment on bank checks. The incident involved Sheng Kee, which on June 29th, using a check drawn by the American Light Company, a depositor at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, for an immediate national currency amount of 70,000 yuan, sought to convert it into cash at the bank. The bank issued a bank draft No. 509981 for the same amount, which Sheng Kee entrusted to a bank on June 30th to collect funds from the Bankers' Association Clearing House. Unexpectedly, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank instructed to stop payment. Sheng Kee argued that the bank draft, issued by the bank, circulated in the market and was regarded as cash. Since its common use, there had been no instance of the issuing bank unilaterally stopping payment. When questioned, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank's response, as reported in the newspapers, stated, "Regarding the matter of stopping payment on bank draft No. 509981 drawn by the American Light Dyeing Factory, this bank has clearly responded on July 7th and the three days prior." Concerning the matter of negotiable instrument credit, inquiries were made to a certain banker, who stated, "Regarding the Zhejiang Industrial Bank's stopping of payment on the check, I have only read about it in the newspapers and am unclear about the details. This is a matter between the two parties, but from a negotiable instrument perspective, a bank draft is a check drawn by various banks on the Bankers' Association Clearing House, equivalent to a bank's own draft. It is a type of unconditional payment security, a negotiable instrument for clearing between financial institutions. It is now widely circulated in the city, being transferred and accepted, and enjoys considerable public trust and popularity. Furthermore, the regulations of the city's banking industry stipulate that 'stopping payment on a bank draft due to loss is limited to cases of fire, theft, or loss in transit.' This matter has already attracted attention from all sectors and is somewhat related to all banks. I believe the truth will soon be revealed to clarify the real reason for stopping payment." (N)</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Fluctuations Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the fluctuation range of the discount rate for remittances narrowed. In the morning, it initially rose slightly to the 200 yuan mark per thousand, but by late morning, it had fallen back to 195 yuan. In the afternoon, it was even more stable, remaining at 195 yuan, the same as the final price on the previous Saturday. The interbank lending rate announced by the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 2 jiao for both the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Flicker, Foreign Stocks Reach New Highs, Beining Railway Bonds Paid with Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market was flickering and uncertain yesterday, and sentiment remained somewhat uneasy. According to newspaper reports, the British and American fleets plan to head to the Far East to blockade Japan, which should cause market prices to rise. Furthermore, there is talk that interest on national salvation bonds will continue to be paid in legal tender. The government's determination to maintain public bonds is evident in this. News of British, American, and French support for legal tender and loans continued to circulate, so the market initially showed signs of rising. However, due to abundant floating shares and sales related to special interests, it suffered setbacks again. The trend indicates that after three consecutive days of declines, the decrease has narrowed to about 3 yuan, and the future should improve. Yesterday, numbers 11 and 35 were initially bought and rose, with Type C reaching over 2 yuan. Subsequently, number 38 was vigorously sold off in large quantities, causing a slight turnaround to be unexpectedly thwarted by numbers 49 and Yongkang, which were also sold off in large quantities, further weakening market prices. On the buying side, Tian Sheng bought in a forward-looking manner, absorbing numbers 11 and 35 at lower prices. Dingkang and Yizhong also made considerable purchases, and retail investors generally bought less and sold more. As a result, the price increased slightly by 1 jiao, reaching 7 jiao. The total turnover was approximately 800,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading involved many asking prices but few successful transactions. Although the results were similar, there were no settlements.</p>
<p>The General Chamber of Commerce reported that due to further tightening of foreign exchange, the rubber stock market was unusually firm. The prices of most stocks reached new highs. Sellers believed that if foreign exchange continued to tighten at the current prices, they could continue to rise, so they all held back and stopped selling. Industrial stocks were calm but somewhat sluggish.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegraphic Dispatch from London: The 1899 Imperial Railways of North China Loan, commonly known as the Beining Railway 5% bonds, the 35th drawing for redemption of principal, was held in June of this year. The principal to be redeemed is 57,500 British pounds, and the 80th interest coupon, totaling 8,625 British pounds, both totaling 66,125 British pounds, matured on the 1st of this month and have been announced for payment by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in London.</p>
<h3>China National Products Company to Increase Capital by 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The China National Products Company, according to a resolution passed at a shareholders' extraordinary meeting the day before yesterday, will increase its new capital by 200,000 yuan in national currency. Together with the original capital of 400,000 yuan in national currency, the total capital will be 600,000 yuan in national currency. 50,000 yuan will be allocated from the profits of the company's Changsha branch and distributed evenly to the old shareholders. The remaining amount will be supplemented by the old shareholders in proportion to their old shares, with each two old shares carrying the right to subscribe for one new share. The deadline is September 30th.</p>
<h3>Grain: Who is Responsible for Today's Rice Market? Readers Can Judge for Themselves; Resolution is Expected Soon</h3>
<p>Following Du Lai's advice to fellow rice merchants to trade within the limits and avoid private transactions, he also announced in the market yesterday: The Shanghai Municipal Council has set the price limit at 20 yuan for Japonica rice and 16 yuan for Indica rice, but private transactions have become an open secret. It is impossible to purchase goods within the limits, and exceeding the limits is illegal, placing us in a difficult situation. Fellow merchants should abide by the price limits for the best, etc. Therefore, the rice market was again in a standstill yesterday. The only transactions made were for Leli Dongshuang at 21 yuan, local glutinous rice at 24.5 yuan, foreign glutinous rice at 23 yuan, high-grade Indica rice at 16 yuan, and low-grade rice at 16 yuan. The exact amount of rice stored in Shanghai is unknown, but the quantity of goods purchased before the price limits must be very large. Selling Japonica rice at the limit price of 20 yuan and high-grade Indica rice at 16 yuan in the retail market should be sufficient to meet demand. Therefore, the price limits set by the Shanghai Municipal Council are well-founded, and the difficulty felt by large mills is their inability to fulfill their desires.</p>
<p>Small rice shops are facing great difficulties. Since the population of the foreign concessions has increased from sparse to dense and the prices of various food items have risen from cheap to expensive, rice shops have also flourished with the rapid increase in population and the development of the market. However, business has become quite difficult recently, because their capital is meager. Usually, their retail transactions involve only repeated buying and selling, with goods entering and leaving quickly. The inventory in the shop is usually no more than 60 or 70 shi, which can only last for 10 or 8 days. In the current environment, it is impossible to purchase goods at the limit price, which means there are no goods to sell to the market, causing customers to go elsewhere and forcing them to close their doors. To maintain their livelihoods, the only option is to purchase goods through private transactions outside the market. This involves taking risks, so small and large merchants, although both subject to the price limits, experience uneven levels of hardship.</p>
<p>Rice merchants, on the other hand, speak official jargon, claiming that they only act as intermediaries, earning commissions, and that most of the goods they held have been sold off. The current inventory in warehouses is held by general non-industry speculators. They have completely absolved themselves of responsibility and claim that they cannot do business and can only stop operating. Therefore, the market has become desolate in recent days.</p>
<p>Customers also have their own perspective, believing that they specialize in transportation to make a living. Once the goods are assembled, they can be sold off. Speculation and hoarding are only possible for those with large capital and sufficient strength. With meager capital, they cannot hold out for long. When they are forced to, they will sell off even at a loss. For example, the current price of southern goods from the interior is 19 yuan (some say 18 yuan). Adding transportation costs, taxes, miscellaneous fees, and commissions of 2.3 yuan, the cost to Shanghai is 21.3 yuan. Adding commission again, they must sell at 21.5 yuan. However, the current price limit is 20 yuan, so how can they sell off? Therefore, they are all reluctantly withholding samples and waiting for the situation to change. If they cannot hold out, they will have to sell.</p>
<p>The rise in rice prices is due to the strong power of hoarders, who are unwilling to sell even as prices rise. Their power is strong precisely because they are supported by the financial sector. It is rumored that the financial sector provides loans for hoarding rice at 80% of its value. Therefore, one investment of capital is used multiple times. As rice hoarding continues, rice prices are unlikely to ease. Therefore, the public is indirectly benefiting from the financial industry's high-priced rice.</p>
<p>The future trend seems to be easing. For example, the rice arriving yesterday included more than 1,000 bags of Songjiang and Nangang early and late rice, 26 carloads of Baobaozi and Fengjing goods, which were not sampled. Furthermore, it is rumored that Wuhu has implemented the lifting of the ban, and the first batch of goods is being loaded for export, said to be more than 5,000 bags. If this news is true, the chaotic market is expected to be clarified and return to normal, and the people of Shanghai will no longer have to fear for their food supply. Furthermore, new crops are approaching in various regions. For example, if the weather is good in Wuhu, the early Indica rice is said to be available in ten days. New rice from Pudong has been hindered by transportation difficulties, so only the first batch has arrived without any subsequent shipments. However, this isolation will certainly not last long.</p>
<p>The official market for guest Indica rice remained small yesterday, because machine-milled Indica rice and high-grade Indica rice were both above the 16-yuan limit price. Therefore, the market was decorated with medium-grade and low-grade Indica rice, old machine-milled rice, and brown rice. In the afternoon, it was rumored that Wuhu would lift the ban within a week, so guest hoarders were slightly more willing to sell. Total transactions were nearly 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>Importers of foreign rice continue to hold back, and the market is extremely quiet. However, it is rumored that rice merchants have suggested to the concession authorities that they purchase and supply rice to stabilize prices in Shanghai. While this is beneficial to the future of the people's food supply, it also has drawbacks. With the current exchange rate for merchants to enter the customs, no matter how low the original price of foreign rice is, the price in legal tender will be extremely high. Therefore, rice merchants will justify raising prices, claiming that even foreign rice is so expensive, so the price of domestic rice is justified. In this way, residents will suffer the hidden pain of price increases before benefiting from the actual stability of rice prices. Therefore, this issue must be carefully reviewed when ordering rice.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Rise Again</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the price of No. 2 flour from the factory rose again by 2 jiao, reaching a spot price of 5.5 yuan. Due to repeated increases in the price of wheat raw materials, factories have little flour in stock. In addition to supplying small wholesale transactions within the street, they continue to restrict large-volume sales to out-of-town merchants. The total transaction volume was small, totaling 40,000 to 50,000 bags including local and out-of-town merchants. It is rumored that recalled goods are also increasing simultaneously with factory prices. Brokers and customers are both seeking to purchase flour, but the floating stock on the market is depleted, and the market is unusually firm. 20,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tanggu today.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market experienced an even more intense price surge. Recently, prices in Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places have soared. Furthermore, factories have long found it difficult to accept foreign wheat prices, so the demand for local wheat is increasing. Hoarders are also greedy, and suppliers are taking the opportunity to hold up the market. Moreover, the gold market is rising sharply, and sentiment is extremely bullish. The market has seen unprecedented surge. A total of 38 carloads of wheat from Changzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Guantian were sold, including 22 carloads from the Fuxin Factory, 6 carloads from the Fufeng Factory, and more than 10 carloads from hoarders. The highest price was 7.8 yuan, and 7.5 to 7.2 yuan, up 4, 5, and 6 jiao. Furthermore, 480 bags of food-grade beans are being shipped to Tanggu today.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Formidably, Jin Cheng Already at 700 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the price surge remained strong. This is because merchants from South China and Hong Kong are actively purchasing, and sentiment is strong. Merchants from the interior have long stopped purchasing domestic yarn, but recently, the prices of unpopular yarns are relatively cheap, and ready-made goods are available. Sales of 20-count Xing Shi and Wu Zi yarns are brisk, and selling prices have therefore increased. As for popular yarns, the surge in prices for 20-count Te Jin Cheng is astonishing, reaching a high of 700 yuan. 20-count Shuang Ma has reached 620 yuan. The severity of this price surge is truly unknown.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened relatively flat. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma foreign warehouse was 604 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 591 yuan, similar to the previous day. Shortly thereafter, the market suddenly became tense, and buying intensified, saying that foreign exchange had shrunk slightly and gold had risen slightly. The yarn market then jumped up more than ten yuan in an instant. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma foreign warehouse continued to rise to 620 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 598 yuan. It was found that 1,075 bales were traded in half a day, compared to 160 bales traded on the previous day. The market price of 20-count Shuang Ma rose by 17 yuan, Te Jin Cheng rose by 25 yuan, and Mu Yang rose by 2 yuan. The purchase amounts for each merchant are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Hong Kong 540 Ningbo 40</p>
<p>Wenzhou 20 Yunnan 10</p>
<p>Interior 90 Peers 375</p>
<p>Total 1,075</p>
<p>Japanese yarn opened with an upward trend. The price of 20-count Yue Qin for this month was 477 yuan. It suddenly fell by 5 yuan shortly thereafter. Subsequently, as local yarn rose sharply, it was also drawn into a favorable situation, returning to 480 yuan. The closing price was around 478 yuan, but actual demand was average, and hoarders were numerous.</p>
<h3>Fellow Merchants' Stocks Nearly Exhausted, Indian Cotton Rises Again by 3-4 Yuan</h3>
<p>Transactions of local cotton have been cut off, but in reality, factories are all accepting it. However, due to the depletion of inventory, transactions are difficult to come by. However, Japanese factories are keenly collecting Indian cotton and purchasing large quantities. It is said that they are shipping it to Qingdao, so recently, the stocks of fellow merchants have been completely bought out, because their selling prices are 20 yuan cheaper than the prices offered by foreign firms, which is relatively much cheaper. Purchases continue unabated. Transactions have decreased slightly, because the stocks of each firm have mostly been sold out. Market prices have risen again by 3 to 4 yuan. 350 bales of Tongzhou cotton from Northern Jiangsu have arrived. The current prices of spot cotton are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Kelaina 29.0 Peers 500 pieces</p>
<p>Laigonghua 23.0 Peers 200 pieces</p>
<p>Huitongdeng 126.5 Peers 200 pieces</p>
<p>Second Pengjiapu 124.5 Peers 200 pieces</p>
<p>Bailuoqu 210.0 Peers 200 pieces</p>
<p>More Indian cotton has been shipped. The British Company's ship Somali, which came from London via Mumbai, loaded 1,200 pieces of cotton. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today and will dock at Qichang West Wharf in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<p>Another report: Due to further tightening of foreign exchange yesterday, the stock of cotton in Shanghai is dwindling. Therefore, selling prices have surged, but transactions among fellow merchants have become lively. Pingguoer has seen new highs above 100 yuan. The cotton in the Wood Market has almost been completely purchased by Japanese factories. The selling prices of spot and futures are approaching each other. Once the stocks of each firm are sold out, they will order from foreign firms, so it is expected that the day of prosperity for foreign cotton is not far away.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was unusually quiet yesterday. Selling prices did not change at the opening. Later, a portion of the bulls took profits, down 2 or 3 points, but most merchants maintained a wait-and-see attitude and planned to decide on their business strategy after the government's cotton production estimate was released. Therefore, closing prices were unusually calm, up or down 1 or 2 points. Indian combined predictions fell 25 rupees, and the Egyptian market was closed.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Dong Pi White Goods Rise Excessively, Market Suspends Futures Trading, Prices of Chinese Factory Colored Cloth Chaotic, Tightening Foreign Exchange Doubles Exports</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The morning opening was slightly firm. White fine cloth and fine twill rose by 2 jiao per piece. Wholesale shops on the street had the intention to purchase at a lower price. Guangdong merchants also continued to purchase colored twill. In the afternoon, with the British exchange rate within 4 points, hoarders were active, and cloth prices increased. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by another 2 or 3 jiao per piece, heavy coarse cloth and coarse twill rose by 5 jiao, and light cloth rose by 2 jiao. Colored cloth prices were chaotic, lacking a definite market. On the street, 400 to 500 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, woolen cloth, serge, velvet, and other goods were traded. Guangdong merchants purchased more than 100 boxes of colored twill, and Ningbo merchants purchased 50 to 60 boxes of colored twill, bleached cloth, and blue cloth. Due to exchange rate factors, exports to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Siam increased significantly, and yesterday, more than 4,000 pieces of fine twill, bleached cloth, bleached twill, and red ocean labels were purchased.</p>
<p>Dong Pi: New highs for white goods emerge endlessly. Yesterday, 12-pound Long Tou fine cloth for next month's futures was sold by the Ito Company for 18 yuan per piece. Dong Mian Company opened the price of San Tao fine cloth for this month at 16.5 yuan per piece. More than 200 pieces were ordered in total. There is a shortage of spot fine cloth chips on the market, so transactions are not brisk. Long Tou spot price is 17.5 yuan, and this month is 17.75 yuan, up 5 jiao compared to last week. The white goods market, in view of the excessive rise, in order to prevent future risks, yesterday specially notified fellow merchants that from today onwards, new futures trading will be suspended, and only spot goods will be allowed to be bought and sold. Futures that have been done before should be settled by both buyers and sellers themselves. Therefore, yesterday's market's speculative minds were restrained.</p>

<h3>The Philosophy of Closing Windows</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Recently, the scope of women's articles seems to be getting narrower and narrower. My heart is heavy, and my pen is heavy. Although there is absolutely no reason to be pessimistic and disappointed in such an environment, the fact that I no longer have a lighthearted mood may be true. For those who value material enjoyment more than spiritual life, as long as they still have money and do not need to "cross the bridge to the north," they will not painfully feel the darkness of their current lives. High commodity prices will not affect the rich. Even if the price of "Beauty" brand ice cream rises again, it will certainly not cause a "ice cream grabbing" craze. In short, we do not want to consider people who are not directly related to the seven necessities of life. These people may also have spiritual lives, but they probably do not go beyond the circles of dance halls and swimming pools.</p>
<p>The generation who stay in Shanghai who feel the most pain are those who are struggling to eat but still demand some spiritual food. At one time, this generation was the so-called petty bourgeoisie. Although the petty bourgeoisie is said to have no real class foundation, this generation is undoubtedly the backbone of society in every modern country. If you examine the central technical personnel and organizational leaders in various aspects of society, all of them belong to this class. Therefore, the current living conditions of this generation should be noted by everyone who cares about social issues.</p>
<p>According to my personal observation, material life is certainly important to this generation, but spiritual life affects them far more than material life. It is said that the most universally accepted slogan during the Soviet revolution was "Land, bread, and freedom." If land represents the demands of farmers and bread represents the demands of workers, then freedom expresses the spiritual demands of the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>The reason why we feel heavy pressure on our hearts today is probably because we are losing our freedom. The increasingly tight atmosphere of darkness has made us feel suffocated. But what makes us most painful is that in this situation, there is still a generation of people who consider themselves "wise" who are automatically closing the few windows that remain!</p>
<p>Interpreting the ancient saying "protect oneself wisely" only as opportunism is equivalent to prolonging one's life, and it will never protect anything other than a dog's life!</p>
<p>We do not need to make demands that exceed objective conditions, but using "environmentalism" to trap oneself is the most foolish strategy.</p>
<p>"Give me liberty, or give me death!" We should firmly remember and practice this saying, especially everyone who works in the field of spiritual life.</p>
<p>When others build walls, we tear down houses. When others demand to close doors, we should respond by opening large windows, not closing windows! Technique is a problem, but never forget the principle.</p>
<h3>German Labor Camps (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Mou Zhou</p>
<p>Three years ago, I was also a prisoner who was punished to do hard labor in the swamps. Just two or three weeks ago, my friend left the labor camp in the Ems River Marshland (a type of prison specially established after the German National Socialist Party came to power, where the prisoners detained were mostly political prisoners - translator). As he described his experiences, the wilderness of Esterwege and Neusustrum reappeared before me.</p>
<p>Near the end of 1936, news leaked into the penitentiary that batches of prisoners would be escorted to the swamps again. No one wanted to go. Therefore, some prisoners dripped indelible black lead solutions into their eyes, wanting to cause inflammation or even blindness. Some used a needle to pierce dirty gauze threads through their palms, wanting to cause blood poisoning. They would rather go blind early or be sent to the hospital than go to the swamps.</p>
<p>The "political prisoners" were very proud, and they were unwilling to take such passive measures. I spent three years in the penitentiary, and I never heard political prisoners attempt suicide.</p>
<p>On April 14, 1937, the penitentiary authorities gathered the prisoners and escorted one hundred of them - two-thirds of whom were political prisoners - to the train station. By the morning of the second day, after an eighteen-hour journey, the train arrived at Doersen station. On the platform, the guards of the labor camp were waiting for their prisoners with mounted bayonets. A little further away, "swamp trains" - special trains connecting various labor camps - were parked. As soon as the train doors opened, the guards grabbed the prisoners and beat them with their gun butts, saying, "Swine! Turtles! Get on the freight cars!"</p>
<p>By 1937, roads and permanent railways had been laid in the swamps. In March of 1935, when I boarded the "swamp train," it still carried me through pathless, humid wilderness. However, the bestial treatment of prisoners had not changed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gust of wind blew across the swamp, and it started to rain. In two or three minutes, the prisoners were soaked. Suddenly, a rude command echoed in the air: "Kneel! Those who are still standing will be shot!" This was the voice of Commander Willi Bertram. There was almost no room to stand on the train, let alone kneel. Before the prisoners could figure out what they should do, bullets were already whistling over their heads.</p>
<p>The train stopped two or three yards away from the camp. On the way to the camp, there were guard towers with machine guns and electric fences. "Line up! In two rows!" The guards ran beside the prisoners, bumping them with their gun butts.</p>
<p>When the prisoners arrived in the camp's courtyard, the guards' faces showed the joy of sadists. Two adjutants - August Dickmeier and Helmuth Meier - oversaw the prisoners. They formed the prisoners into teams, and each person received a number and a number in the barrack. This took three hours. Talking was strictly forbidden, and leaving the ranks was also forbidden. One prisoner could not bear it and moved slightly away from the line. Helmuth Meier grabbed him, punched and kicked him with his elbows, and then ordered him to run around the barracks pushing a cart loaded with yellow sand, until he was exhausted and died.</p>
<p>The officer who registered the prisoners' resumes was a round-faced, chubby eccentric. My friend's turn came. "Why are you here?" he was asked. The guard stared sharply at his lips. "For pol..." Before he could finish, he was punched heavily in the face. All political prisoners received the same treatment. Criminal prisoners, however, were spared.</p>
<p>After several hours, the registration process finally came to an end. The prisoners were driven into the barracks. As soon as they arrived at their dormitories, the siren sounded: "Go to the courtyard to listen to roll call!" This was repeated several times. At five thirty, the food was brought out, but the prisoners were ordered to go to bed.</p>
<p>Even so, the "welcome ceremony" to thwart the prisoners' courage was not over. In the middle of the night, the sound of leather boots could be heard in the dormitory. Then came a drunken roar: "Swine, you will never leave here alive. We will shoot you and use your corpses as fertilizer for the swamp." The frightened prisoners kept silent in their beds. "You little cowards," the drunken voice continued, "Now, you are pale, you have lost your vascular nerves!" Afterwards, the guards picked up their whips and lashed the prisoners.</p>
<p>In the morning, the prisoners were awakened at four thirty. Before breakfast, the adjutant came in to check the beds.

Those prisoners whose beds could not satisfy the aesthetic views of the guards would suffer bad luck. At six o'clock, the work began.</p>
<h3>Repeating Past Mistakes</h3>
<p>— (Translated from the "Zi Lin Bao")</p>
<h3>Talking About Cows</h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>Domestic Cows and Wild Cows</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Chucang wrote an article several years ago titled "The Awakening of the Cow," which is still included in the Chinese textbooks and used as teaching material. The article is quite long and mainly tells the story of the farm cow of farmer Yuan Laofu in Suzhou, who, due to mistreatment, initiated a general strike with the sickle, plow, rake, mud grab, etc. The cow became the leader of the alliance. As a result, the farmer Laofu used the sickles and other farming tools to deal with the cows, and the cows, unable to endure the hunger, finally surrendered. The cow himself gave a grand speech, blaming his companions for three reasons: first, lack of mutual support in living; second, lack of determination to sacrifice; and third, lack of complete organizational awareness. Therefore, the result could only be failure.</p>
<p>This tragic failure is the inevitable fate of domestic cows because they depend on people for their fodder. The mutual support in living that Mr. Ye mentioned is easier said than done. Not to mention cows, even humans, who are known as the most intelligent of all creatures, have not achieved it, have they? As for the determination to sacrifice and complete organizational awareness, these are even more difficult. If these three difficulties could be overcome, I think today would already be the era of cows as masters of the world; the one holding the reins would not be a human, but the cow itself.</p>
<p>Cows stand in opposition to humans. If they could break free from human homes, not be attached to the fodder that people give them, and return to the life of wild cows, they would surely achieve victory.</p>
<p>I happened to see in the "Science and Life" column of the Shen Bao supplement three "Scientific Liaozhai" stories by Mr. He Shan. The third story said, "Darwin also said that wild bison can help each other defend against enemies. Whenever they encounter a wolf invasion, they always place their young in the center of the herd, and the old cows always use their heads to bear the brunt, making angry expressions, and using the horns of their heads as weapons to resist the enemy, forming a forest of spears. The wolves fear their strength, knowing that approaching will inevitably lead to misfortune. Although they are eager to attack, they hesitate and do not succeed."</p>
<p>Wild cows have the determination to sacrifice; otherwise, they would not dare to be enemies with wolves. Wild cows have complete organizational awareness; "bearing the brunt" and "forming a forest of spears" are not expressions of complete organization? Wild cows also have mutual support in living; they nurture and defend themselves and can also protect their future generations, placing the young in the center to prevent them from being seized by the enemy. Not only should domestic cows feel ashamed of this, but we humans should also feel ashamed of this, shouldn't we?</p>
<p>Whipping Cow Backs and Burning Cow Tails</p>
<p>Those who issue orders and instruct cows are adults. Cows should do hard work, and people should also do hard work. If people only whip cows to work and are unwilling to endure hardship themselves, that is not acceptable. If cows are tired, they should be whipped, but if people are tired, they are not whipped, that is not fair.</p>
<p>"Dong Zhi Gao Miscellaneous Records" contains a very meaningful passage:</p>
<p>Fei Xiu and Huang 　were friends despite their age difference. One day, they walked together along the Wan River and saw someone driving a firewood cart down the embankment. The mud was deep, and the cow was tired, being whipped incessantly. Xiu tried to stop the whipper, but Ye immediately said, "You must beat it harder; when the two-legged ones can't persuade the four-legged ones, it's good to beat them if they don't want to move."</p>
<p>Here, "two-legged ones" refers to people, and "four-legged ones" refers to cows. If the four-legged cow is tired, it should be beaten harder, but if the two-legged person is tired and "unwilling to move," if you don't use the whip to beat them, they will always be tired because people are much lazier than cows. If you don't believe it, look at the people who are violently whipping the backs of cows, sitting high on the firewood cart. They are unwilling to walk at all because they are afraid that the mud under the embankment is difficult to walk on. Instead, they add their own weight to the cow's body. Do they ever carry some of the firewood to reduce the cow's burden?</p>
<p>According to what Pei and Huang saw and discussed, they did not tell us the outcome of the event. Did the firewood cart escape the deep mud? Did it overcome the difficulty?</p>
<p>I think that, in addition to the driver taking some of the weight to carry on their back, if the cow is still tired and unwilling to move forward, then you can only burn the cow's tail (because whipping has become ineffective). Imitate the story of Tian Dan's fire bull formation. When the cow's tail is burned, it will surely jump and rush forward, running out of the deep mud.</p>
<p>However, the cow may not be willing to stop in the mud and refuse to move forward. Burning the tail is a last resort, to be done only when absolutely necessary. If Tian Dan had not been trapped in the city of Jimo and unable to save himself, he would not have casually deployed the fire bull formation, would he?</p>
<p>The most important thing is to whip the person driving the firewood cart. "When the two-legged ones can't persuade the four-legged ones, it's good to beat them if they don't want to move" is indeed a famous saying.</p>

<h3>Three or Four Things About Actors</h3>
<h3>Gong Jianong</h3>
<p>Editor's Note: Jianong is a veteran member of the Star Film Company, with refined and experienced acting skills as his only specialty. He has acted in films for over ten years, accounting for more than half of all Star productions. He is extremely rich in acting experience. This article is based on the actor's perspective and offers very insightful views, which every actor should recognize.</p>
<p>Since dedicating myself to film, it has been more than ten years without realizing it. Based on my past experience from an actor's perspective, I believe that the concept of an actor should be seen as an artist with a certain amount of creativity and life, and should not be regarded as a mere simple and mechanical tool of the director. Because the actor's performance is not only a means by which the director achieves his goals, but in reality, the performance itself is a creative and living art.</p>
<p>Actors not only serve the screenwriter and director in art, but also serve society like the screenwriter and director. Moreover, actors should also have a correct understanding of society, and the depth of this understanding is directly proportional to the height of their artistic achievement.</p>
<p>Actors should have a correct understanding of society as a foundation, so that they can fully develop their acting skills in their entire performing life and in their service to society. Because the characters in a play, whether important or not, their thoughts, emotions, actions, and various habits are directly or indirectly determined by the social life in which they live. Without understanding this, the actor's performance is at most a vulgar, superficial, and lifeless imitation, and sometimes it may even be completely wrong. Therefore, understanding society is the key to understanding the character and determining the character's performance.</p>
<p>Not only should actors fully understand the role they play, but they should also fully understand the theme of the play and the other parts that contribute to that theme. In other words, they should study the entire play and gain a complete and thorough understanding.</p>
<p>As for those who only let actors know their role, or even only let actors understand a certain scene in isolation, this is not allowed for actors who are social artists. Because there are many unfavorable situations in this case:</p>
<p>(1) Eliminates the actor's creative and concrete performance - an actor has a close relationship with the entire play. If an actor does not understand his relationship with other actors in a play, does not understand the relationship and effect between scenes in an act, that is, does not understand the theme and development of the entire play, then this actor can hardly perform well, even in a lifeless, imitative, and vulgar way. What creative performance is there?</p>
<p>(2) Destroys the overall effect of the entire play - if an actor only knows his role or only understands a certain scene, it will affect other actors, and as a result, the entire play will become loose, because the actor's performance and effect are connected to the performance and effect of other actors.</p>
<p>(3) Eliminates the actor's personality - if an actor cannot fully understand the entire play, and therefore cannot understand the role he plays, and thus cannot make a creative and concrete performance of his role, then he will not be able to fully and appropriately develop his personality in his performance, and may even make his personality disappear.</p>
<p>(4) Makes it impossible for the actor to fully understand the role he plays - an actor playing a character in a play is performing in cooperation with other actors in various parts, and the actor's performance or the character's performance has a close relationship with the entire play. If this actor does not understand the entire play, then he will definitely not be able to fully understand the role he plays.</p>
<p>Therefore, for a play to succeed, it is necessary for the actor to have a full and deep understanding of the entire play, and this full understanding of the entire play and the ability to portray the personality of a certain character are based on his deep understanding of the society in which he lives.</p>
<p>In current and future films and dramas, actors who can grasp a certain social consciousness and emotion are not just simple mechanical tools of the director but are actors with their own inherent creativity. Only such actors can jointly advance the art of film and the art of drama with other personnel.</p>
<p>These are some very superficial and foolish opinions I have based on my usual observations in the actor's job.</p>
<h3>Prelude to Yang Baosen's Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Aiping Room Owner</p>
<p>As the intense summer heat gradually dissipates, the theaters in Shanghai are about to revive. The Golden Grand Theater has always been known for its reasonable ticket prices. For its autumn opening, it has already invited Song Dezhu, a talented flower actress from a drama school in the former capital, and Yang Baosen, a famous dragon-bearded Sheng actor of the Yu school. Among these two, Yang has performed in Shanghai before, and his art is well known to all sectors of the city. Song, on the other hand, is coming to Shanghai for the first time and is a new figure in the art world.</p>
<p>Regarding everything about Dezhu, I have already written about it in this newspaper at the beginning of last month, so I will not repeat it here. What I want to talk about now is about Baosen.</p>
<p>Baosen is from northern Anhui, and he is the grandson of the famous flower actress Yang Guiyun (Baoxian). He is thirty-one years old this year. He is amiable and approachable, and has no theatrical airs at all. His art was taught by the famous teacher Chen Xiuhua. He was famous in his youth, and his singing and acting style follow the style of Shu Yan, gaining a good understanding of the subtleties. Shu Yan himself once praised him as his successor. He has a lot of repertoire. He is especially well-known and praised for plays such as "Empty City Stratagem," "Baochen Banquet," "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Zhulian Village," "Nanyang Pass," and "Wulong Court."</p>
<p>Baosen's singing and acting style follow the style of Shu Yan. Therefore, in all his performances, he strives to maintain the traditional rules without following any fashionable trends. The depth of his skills is obvious to all. Therefore, famous actors such as Xiao Cuihua, Zhang Eyun, and Mao Shilai are all happy to cooperate with him to achieve the effect of peonies and green leaves.</p>
<p>It is impossible to fully describe all the advantages of Baosen's stage performances in just a few words. Briefly speaking, his demeanor can be described as "calm and relaxed." He does not change his demeanor from beginning to end. His recitations are not as loose as Fu Ying's, and his acting style is more pure and natural than Fu Ying's. His appearance has a scholarly air, which is rare among ordinary Sheng actors.</p>
<p>Baosen's reputation declined in the past due to his addiction. Later, he revitalized himself, eliminated all things harmful to his body and mind, and regained his former glory by performing with Xiao Cuihua. His recent collaboration with Eyun showed even more progress than before, and his reputation is likely to surpass what it was in the past. He performed the highlight play "Si Lang Visits His Mother" several times in Shanghai. The "diao mao," "shui fa," and "ga diao" were all extremely wonderful. His energy was full, and his voice was clear and melodious, which was greatly appreciated by the audience. This time, Dezhu is coming south, and Baosen is also coming with her to perform together, which will be even better than before. This can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Mei Ehui in "Shanghai Nights"</h3>
<p>— (Bai Li)</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>If they happen to meet a good-natured boss, they will agree to the actors' requests, and things will seem peaceful in the short term. However, people's desires are hard to fill. After only a few days, the actors will ask for more money. Even if the theater owner is easy to talk to, he will not be able to stand it at this point, and the result will inevitably be a breakdown in the relationship between the two parties. There is also a kind of stubborn and unreasonable theater owner who, no matter how famous an actor is and how much money he earns for him, will not even consider raising his salary. If you try to reason with him gently, he has gentle ways of dealing with you; if you use a tough approach, he has tough methods. As the saying goes, "Even a strong dragon cannot suppress a local snake." No matter how good the relationship is between the actors from out of town, it is very difficult for them to beat the locals. Therefore, their relationship cannot always be harmonious.</p>
<p>Based on the two reasons mentioned above, it can be seen that once an actor has been singing in a certain place for a long time, a rift will develop with the theater owner, and he will want to leave this place and join a new troupe as soon as possible. If someone happens to come and invite him, this is exactly what he wants, a happy and quick decision. It is always better than joining a troupe on his own initiative. The talent scouts are all veterans in the opera troupes and have already figured out this kind of psychology of the actors. They will watch the play for several days in a row and will become very familiar with a certain actor. According to insiders, talent scouts all have a secret signal, and the actors who often travel around also understand these gestures. Once the two sides have tacitly agreed, when the play ends, the actor will instruct his assistant to secretly follow behind the talent scout. Once they arrive at their residence, they can say what they want to say. After several talks, the conditions are agreed upon. Then, a deposit is paid, and a plan for eloping is made. Fortunately, there is no trouble with carrying costumes. All they have to do is pack the things mentioned above into a small bundle in advance (as for the weapons that the martial arts actors use, they have to be sacrificed).</p>
<h3>Doting Wife and Intimate Friend</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Doting Wife and Intimate Friend" and "Wife, Doctor and Nurse" are comedies of the same type. The leading actors Warner Baxter and Loretta Young are also old "regulars." However, the nurse Virginia Bruce is now replaced by Binnie Barnes as the intimate friend.</p>
<p>The love scandals of male and female stars in Hollywood often cause a stir. By the time a film magazine crosses the Pacific Ocean and arrives in Shanghai, some of the fiery reports are already history. Therefore, scripts like "Doting Wife and Intimate Friend," at least reflect the general trend of their love life in an objective way.</p>
<p>The director's skills are worth learning. Like "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom," which premiered last week, every character and every scene can clearly portray their personality and are handled in a lively and moving way, so that the audience under the screen cannot help but laugh involuntarily.</p>
<p>Warner Baxter is an architect who hates his wife's singing. Loretta Young does not realize that her singing voice is not pleasing and constantly makes strange noises. The director writes this mismatched couple in a very interesting way. The characters surrounding them, such as Loretta Young's parents and singing teacher, are also written in a very delicate and thoughtful way.</p>
<p>There are many wonderful scenes in the whole film. For example, Warner Baxter's first encounter with Binnie Barnes, Binnie Barnes discovers his singing voice and advises him to practice singing; Warner Baxter returns from a performance and rushes to his wife's bedside, their soft words, their hugs, are all very moving. In the end, after Loretta Young leaves, Warner Baxter is flustered and does not know what to do when he goes on stage, causing many jokes and creating a commotion in the audience. Loretta Young happens to be in the audience, rushes to the backstage, and the couple reconciles. Although this scene consistently gives us many laughs, Warner Baxter's pain is still revealed behind the laughter, moving people's hearts.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Warner Baxter plays a good role. The anxiety when disturbed by the singing, the embarrassment when he first goes on stage, the pain after his wife leaves, and the remorse in the backstage can all be clearly analyzed on his facial expressions. Loretta Young's coquettishness and Binnie Barnes's charming appearance are also lovely.</p>
