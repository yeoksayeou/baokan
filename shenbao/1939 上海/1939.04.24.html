<p>社評</p>
<h3>納稅義務</h3>
<p>近頃上海報紙之本埠新聞欄內，偶有述及印花稅與所得稅事者；記者媿不深知二稅在上海之稅務近况，顧觸發一念，請泛論之。</p>
<p>默察一般人於徵稅納稅之性質，大多未能明確體認；故對於政府之徵稅，與官員之搜括，幾於相提並論；對於一己之納稅，與聚賭之抽頭，又幾於相提並論。非不是認徵稅爲合法，然於所謂合法，在觀念上幾乎同於權威之强制；非不是認納稅爲義務，然於所謂義務，在觀念上幾乎同於委屈之報効。此種觀念錯誤，有其復雜原因，非得驟然矯正者也。因是之故，新稅甚難推行，推行甚難大效；上海印花稅夙稱難辦，所得稅愈新愈難。况入非常時期，中國在上海之法統關係，雖毫無變更；即徵稅之合法，納稅之義務，雖悉如舊觀，然無論自權威强制之觀念言之，或自委屈報効之觀念言之，俱有不同於往日者矣。惟不同於往日，故聞印花稅與所得稅之成績皆銳降。</p>
<p>茲所欲喚起一般人之注意者，即自根本言之，政府以官員爲代表，然政府與官員不同；取之於人民者，徵稅與搜括不同。人民對於合法之徵稅，負有納稅之義務；而義務之踐行，非以政府之權威，非以官員之强制，乃以人民本分之自發。至於權威與强制，原非政府官員所必需；乃因人民不能踐行其本分，政府官員始發動其權威而加强制。故在承平之日，政府權威無問題，官員之强制無阻梗，人民帖然奉公守法，是不足道；及遭非常變故，其地其事爲政府官員權威强制所不及，而其人民猶能踐行其義務者，則愛國之表見也。此種精神，不惟見之納稅一端而已。凡屬國事，大致若斯：如關統一，非需國家之武力，隨時隨地，控制全國，乃在全國全民，愛護統一；如關法治，非需國家之法院，隨時隨地，執法相繩，乃在全國全民，共遵法治；如擁護領袖，服從中央，非領袖强迫之，中央號召之，乃在全國全民擁護之，服從之，易辭言之，此皆非權威與强制所致者也。</p>
<p>原義務觀念，有其道德上之無上價値，而逈不同於權威强制。謂有事焉，在權威强制之下，不得不爲而爲之，則無問其事之何如性質，爲之者智愚賢不肖等耳。何也？其間無義務觀念也。無知人民，不知義務，非權威强制不納稅；及一朝淪陷，便爲順民，彼所被迫繳納於異族者，亦與繳納本國之觀念等耳。惟愛國之人民則不然，當其保持自由之日，必不同於順民之被迫納欵，而必自盡其義務。要知義務不由環境，人民對國家，可以取喻於夫婦。夫爲婦義，婦爲夫貞，此義務也。此類義務之必須保持，不因夫婦之朝夕相守；換言之，即使夫婦久別遠離，夫猶有其應守之義，婦猶有其應守之貞。若夫之力量不及於婦而婦即不守婦道，婦之力量不及於夫而夫即爲所欲爲，則夫婦關係無可維繫。國家與人民亦然。若國力所不及，人民即不盡其義務，則媿爲人民，遑論愛國。</p>
<p>由上論之，我人旣數見上海市民愛國之表示，復傳聞國稅收入之銳降，其矛盾乃不可卒解。意者，猶有政府徵稅即官員搜括之錯覺，而未盡有納稅義務之自覺歟？</p>

<p>（東京）據官方調查、東京區合格女看護三三、二○五人中、僅二二、六一八人刻操此業、其餘一〇、五八七人、雖當局需要其服務甚切、但因所得薪給過低、故已改業或結婚、或寗願賦閒、今春赤痢等症蔓延甚速、當局希望補救看護之缺少、故對看護之合格考試、不若前此之嚴格、冀鼓勵女子操此職業、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>復興中的長沙</h3>
<p>— 常人</p>
<p>焦土後轉換一新面目　高面漸復人民亦歸來</p>
<p>長沙通信、從衡陽到長沙的公路上、祇有很少的軍用汽車在活動、湘潭附近的渡口、長沙大火前夜、會有六百輛以上的汽車在此擁待南渡、現在只有我們所乘的一輛駛上北岸、陌頭楊柳、村前桃花、與叱牛春耕的農夫相對若笑、湘東以及全國各地的人民、正以加緊生產來支持戰爭、答覆敵人、</p>
<p>難然修河兩岸的大戰已經揭開、湘鄂前綫、却仍平靜無事、三月的長沙、已從焦土上復蘇過來、像韋爾斯在「未來世界」中所描寫的第二次世界大戰後的歐洲城市一樣、刦後的人民、正在廢墟中重建一切、可是畢竟沒有那麼寂寞、那麼凄凉、因爲偉大的中華民族、原是最經得起災難、最勇於創造的民族、我會眼見長沙的焚化、相隔不過四個月、又會見了它的新面目、我驚佩湖南人的勇氣、他們在距最前綫只有一百多公里的後方、加緊建設新長沙、</p>
<p>擁有六萬餘幢房屋、數十萬人口的長沙、在大火之後、只在東南北三面零落地留下了一萬多幢和三萬多人口、現在、新的房屋不斷地在瓦礫　中建立起來、人口已將十倍於當時、回鄉的人、還正絡繹於途、茅草和木板搭成的房屋、只是其中的一小部分、講求門飾的市房、也逐漸在增加、南正路一帶、一個都會所應有的商店、已經全備、除了銀行和典當、</p>
<p>金鋪是可驚異的像烟紙店那麼多、論外表、還不及烟紙店那麼「富麗」、實際上、我以爲它却是長沙金融界的覇主、它代替了銀行和典當、許多人把飾金向它兌換現款、許多房屋和商店、却用這兌款才一一的建立起來、社會是建立在經濟基礎上的、中央銀行長沙辦事處、即將在四月初成立、今後的長沙、無疑將因金融的活動而更堅强和穩固起來、</p>
<p>原有的較大的旅館、都燬滅了、代之以興的是四百家以上的「大旅社、最大的「三和」、有三四十間房、普通是從六個到十四五個房間、這些大族社的主人、大多數是稍有房產的幸運的小市民、許多商店的店員、現在委曲而快樂地執行「茶房」的任務、幾乎每一個人家就是一家商店、至少在門前擺一個攤子來謀過活、樣子都很過得去、即使是再好的天氣、市民也想不到空襲這件事、日本軍閤指揮下的「飛賊」們的目標、是集居的和平民衆、長沙這二十多萬疏開着的市民、難以滿足牠們殺人的慾壑、</p>
<p>舊日的大商店、以臨時商店的名義出賣存貨、這「臨時」的意思、是指新屋尚未落成的時期而言、新的商店、常採用對前途樂觀的名詞來做店號、可窺見一般人民對抗戰前途的感想、但也不免有「動搖份子」、有一家飲食店取名「投機館」、我想它的主人、一定預備隨時離開長沙、物價比衡陽高、較不合理地抬高的桂林却低得多、大部份日常用品都來自溫州、很少是國貨廠商的出品、許多牌子是驀生的、許多商標隱着「紅太陽」的意味、</p>
<p>電燈電話、不久就可恢復、有使用電話必要的機關和住宅、都按有軍用電話、日報有國民日報（對開）、陣中日報（四開）、人民日報（小型）等三種、及新市民晚報（八開）一種、最近各報舉行慰勞前方將士的義賣、有以三十元購報一份的讀者、</p>
<p>長沙的夜市、雖比不得從前、却和白天的熙攘情形一樣、因爲電燈還在籌備、熱鬧的街道、便由幾家商店合力維持一盞汽油路燈、每隔一二十家一盞、馬路上反較過去更明亮了、偏僻的街巷、由居民五家合置玻璃火油路燈一盞、雖然比較昏暗一些、行人畢竟便利不少、有些窮苦的人、常在深夜去偷燈油、却並不偷燈、於是有些燈上、我發現有滑稽性的墨筆、或白粉字句、如「你又來了」、「你來偷燈油、當心你老婆」之類、這些路燈的主人對於偷油人、大都一笑了之、因爲一盞火油燈點到深夜、所餘的油料、也已餘有限了、</p>
<p>妓女是軍政商的寄生蟲、允其是在這戰爭的年頭、生活沒有着落的女人，被迫得只有走這條路、省政府規定大東茅巷等幾條巷子、讓登記的妓女居住、晚間在門前懸掛綠色三角燈、但登記時只有一百零一人、因爲怕太「招搖」了、反而影響營業、這幾條巷子、原是長沙閥閱人家集聚之所、現在不知由誰作主、把來改設飯店和旅館、在這區域裹的旅館的旅客一覽表上、有一半以上是寫着「陳艷秋女士」「蕭紅玉女士」之類的名詞、而且下面註明「長住」、是很技巧的廣告方法、廢曆年前、旅館裹可以打牌、現在是禁止了、長沙市政府歸併縣政府後、警察局改屬省政府、附設市政科管理市政、兵役·鄉鎮·保甲·恤金·積穀·等各項、最近已由縣政府辦理、過去長沙市、每月應徵集壯丁二百人、長沙縣一千人、大火前後、人口疏散、現陸續歸來、已開始補徵去年十一月及十二月應徵未徵壯丁、全縣原有千餘保、壯丁的九萬餘人、現存七百餘保、平均每保每月抽徵二人出征、出征人數、迄目前止、共一萬四千餘人、爲國犧牲者的恤金、年達十餘萬元、惟因各部隊調動無定、番號父常有更改、中上級軍官、亦有調動或殉職者、致出征人家屬、多無法調查征人存亡、或獲得陣亡的證明文件、以便請恤、此事有關役政前途利鈍、且各地情形相同、當局似亟應設法解决、至於食糧方面、大火時損失甚大、又因市民散居四鄉、縣境駐軍亦多、目下亦稍成問題、省府及縣府正發給護照、以便人民將存儲鄰近各縣的米穀、運回調節、</p>
<p>米鹽公賣處、現在蜆化爲軍民合作站了、在湘北、現有第×戰區政治部發動組織的四處、常地人民組織的三處、它們主要的任務、是代過境的軍隊採辦柴米油鹽、免得軍隊向人民直接購買時、發生或有的麻煩、每站並有義務輸送隊數十人、由當地學生及壯丁組織、按站抬送受傷將士、不過軍隊運輸、也時常須要伕役、最初縣政府要幾十幾百、都很容易、後來因爲有若干部隊、不讓伕役們在到達某一地點後回鄉、現在比較困難了、人民對於不勞民的軍隊常批評它是好軍隊、第八十九師過長時、沒有需要民伕、就有好幾個農民對我談起它、但如在本鄉工作、民衆有仍踴躍參加、譬如長沙附近的國防工事、現在就有民伕×千人在工作、破壞鐵路公路、也大都是他們的力量、</p>
<p>三月的長沙、已從焦土上復蘇過來、因爲偉大的中華民族、原是最經得起災難、最勇於創造的民族、</p>
<h3>華軍收復增城經過　增城復可以威脅廣州　激戰數日雙方死傷甚鉅　日派大量援兵亦遭擊退</h3>
<p>香港通信、增城在廣州市之束、惠陽博羅之西、廣九路石龍車站以北、佔粵省東江交通之咽喉、爲盤據廣州日軍唯一之外圍重要據點、日軍以該城關係重要、故調大軍駐踞城內、並在城外四郊築堅强之防禦工事、並由此以威脅北江從化等地、迨數月前、華軍猛烈反攻東江、克復惠陽·博羅、一面並進擊石龍、威脅廣州之正面、終因增城日軍之死守不退、致反攻廣州軍事、中途停頓、而東江華軍、僅能困守惠博、無法再事發展、及至今春、東江華軍、于整飭隊部充實軍械之後、卽會同粵北華軍、不斷向增城反攻、蓋此城不下、華軍卽無</p>
<p>威脅廣州　之可能、但數月以來、華方在反攻軍事上、未得進展、此中原因、實以增城四郊之據點、均爲日軍佔有、且築有異常强固之防禦工事、不僅進攻頗感不易、且亦極難收效也、加以日方在增城、石龍、兩地之駐軍、經常在二三千之間、並配有極完備之機械化部隊、華軍縱能突破日軍之一二點、亦不敢孤軍深入、直至最近、日方因江門新會、戰事激烈、戰場擴大、不能不從各方面抽調部隊前往增援、增城駐軍、卽見减少、但尚有一聯隊隊之衆、並仍附有機械化部及砲隊、斯時華方認</p>
<p>時機已到　乃由第九第十二集團軍中抽調兩師、分東北兩路向增城進迫、同時又配合東江方面之一部份游擊隊、北路由從化而來、東路由狗子潭方面暗渡增江、至十三日晨、華軍克復猪牯嶺·蛇頭嶺·焦石嶺·彭屋等外圍據點、完成內錢之包圍、至同日下午六時、兩路華軍、卽在城之四郊、同時進攻、向城垣猛撲、至十四凌晨、華方隊伍、已達增城之東門北門、日軍退守城內、憑城墻固守、但因華軍依然猛攻不已、日軍情急、不得不作困獸之鬥、大半隊伍、以鋼砲爲掩護、猛向城外衝出、</p>
<p>企圖奪團　但終爲華軍擊回城內、傷亡慘重、此時雙方之肉搏衝殺、異常激烈、至十四日晨、日軍之死亡已達四百以上、是時廣州日軍、業已得訊、急派大隊向增城增援、企圖解圍、其前遣部隊由步砲兵混合、竟有四五百人之多、但華軍早有準備、十四日農、日方援軍卽與華軍接觸、雙方砲火猛烈、自十三晚至十四日晨、增援日軍、亦爲華軍擊退、而增城城內日軍、勢成强弩之末、華方乃派便衣隊爲前鋒、</p>
<p>衝入城內　與日軍巷戰、一時城廂大火四起、槍砲密集、至傍晚時分、城內日軍、已告全部肅淸、是役日軍傷亡固重、華軍之作壯烈犧牲者、數亦不少、</p>
<h3>粵省　西江全綫軍事紀實　江門新會全為游擊戰日軍窺單水口已緩和　西江華軍將大舉反攻</h3>
<p>香港通信、本月初間、江門新會一役、激戰數日、其中經過以交通梗塞、傳者多屬不確、記者於江會失陷後兩日、由澳門乘輪過鱉魚沙而至單水口、途决與激戰江門之第一游擊區某大隊長相遇、藉悉當日江會間之戰事眞相、及西江上游之軍事概况、亟紀如下、可作戰地實錄觀也、</p>
<p>江會戰事回憶</p>
<p>此次江會淪陷、不關於將十戰鬥之不英勇、實因武器之劣拙、及衆寡之懸殊、蓋江會守軍、祇有李務滋·周漢玲·所部游擊隊、及池中寬之一部份保安隊、除地方目衛團隊外、合共不滿三千人、自北街開火、以至江會失守、未有正規軍部隊加入作戰、緣江會以至四邑一帶、事先已劃入爲游擊區、主要戰術、即爲游擊戰以少數兵力　消耗敵方之多量實力、事實上亦無須用多量兵力也、當時全綫作戰分爲三個段落、以棠下北街至水南爲第一段、江門至禮樂爲二段岡州路至會城爲第三段、第一段之戰事、以水南爲重心、在棠下北街東砲台激戰的十小時、砲台被毀、乃退集水南、又激戰一晝夜、乃退入江門、第二段之作戰、其重心在於禮樂、華軍從弟一段撒退時、並無一兵一卒還駐江鬥、所有游擊部隊、概散駐於江門外圍各高地、憑險據守、又激戰一晝夜、日陸海空軍大隊炸擊禮樂、全村損毀甚巨、華方陣地、悉被毀壞、始撤退會城、、當戰事最激烈時、兩軍均未入江門、故市內未嘗發生巷戰、直至華軍在外圍撒退完畢、日軍始入佔江門、外間傳江門兩得兩失、實未明眞相耳、第三段會城之戰、亦激戰一晝夜、其時日軍以空軍猛炸、以騎兵追擊、華軍因衆寡懸殊、目連戰至一週之久、軍實亟待補充整理、乃轉移新陣地、而撇退至單水口、此本月六日事也、至是、華軍某師生力軍始趕到、乃輪流替班、與日軍作游擊之相持、現前鋒仍握守大澤·司前·汾水·江口一帶、旬日來、陣綫尚無大變動、統計是役日軍傷亡在五百人以上、華軍傷亡不過百餘人、江門市區、幸未焦土、皆李務滋事先有了計劃、民衆對之、非常感激、最近日軍傷兵紛紛運回廣州、佔領中大醫院·及小北陸軍醫院·爲收容所、每日派憲兵挨戶搜素市內十五歲至二十歲之靑年、吸取血液、轉注於傷兵體內、爲療傷之用、故一般靑年、無不亟離市區、</p>
<p>單水口之形勢</p>
<p>單水口位於新會確山台三縣交界處、為開平縣屬之一巨埠、東距新會城的八十里、南距台山城約七十里、西距開平城約六十餘里、北距鶴山城約七十里、握新鶴開台四縣公路之中心、其水道上通長沙·新昌·荻海·三埠、下達澳門·崖門·江鬥·三門、交通利便、商業暢旺·爲四邑車耍門戶之一、單水口一失、則日軍可以西侵三埠、南下台山　北抄鶴山之背、而肇慶亦岌岌可危、華軍目會城退出後、即加緊布置該處防務、各路援兵、亦紛紛結集、嚴密握守、自十日至十五日、此數日間、日軍迭由會城進攻大澤分水口、企圖衝破比路防錢、佔領單水口據點、惟均被擊退、十六日以後、形勢稍緩、蓋因江會錢之日軍、因東北江花縣從化增城一帶形勢吃緊、將一部份軍隊由江門撤回廣州、助守北路防綫、故對終四邑方面、無力進侵、華軍現正準備向江會反攻、牽制日軍、爲北路大軍應援、</p>
<p>睦洲鄕之匪患</p>
<p>陸洲位於鱉魚沙之上游、爲江門及四邑船艇駛住澳門必經之航路、、江會陷落後、逃難民衆、或搭輪渡、或僱小艇、避往澳門、詎經過睦洲時、多有被匪搶刦、衣服銀幣金飾、一掠而空、一般逃難民衆、眞有上不到天、下不在田之感、前廣州地方法院院長趙士北、新會籍、解職後、燕居里門、本月十二日、因鄉間無從立址、乃偕家人及鄉里、僱蓬艇兩艘駛澳門、不料抵睦洲時、亦遇匪光顧、據談、睦洲向來均係士匪出沒之區、近數年來、會經一度肅淸、茲値地方多故、政治力量無法維持及此、一般歹徒、遂藉時局紛亂之際、出而强搶、內地人民、旣罹兵燹復遭匪患、逃生無路、眞不知伊胡底止矣、其他輪渡之遇刦者、時有所聞、</p>
<p>西江軍事穏定　西江北岸、自龍山·九江·以至三水河口、旣爲日軍所佔領、惟南岸由鶴山沙坪、溯江經三洲·古勞·富灣·金利·而至肇慶峽口一帶、迄今仍未發現日軍踪跡、昨據鶴山縣府某職員談稱、自江門戰事爆發　今、沙坪·谷埠·古勞·一帶、均未有戰事發生、緣該處防綫、駐有極厚之兵力、與九江日軍隔河對峙、當江會戰事劇烈之際、日艦艇曾有十餘艘集中九江、一度在九江發動、試探渡河、襲擊沙坪、嗣被華軍擊退、自是不再來侵襲、故沙坪·谷埠·古勞·各埠、始終未有失守、現局非常穏定、最近西江上游華軍源源發動、向三水河口節節進迫、與華方北江大軍取同一之動作、舉行總反攻、故西江北岸日軍、不得不如以前之活躍、且將上游防綫縮短、退保三水河口·馬口、故西江華軍、不日將有新進展也、</p>

<h3>滬浙交通全斷　甌江口實行封鎖滬開溫各輪先後折回　日艦仍泊洋面無動靜</h3>
<p>浙東甌江口外、前日突到日艦四艘、企圖進窺溫州、日機三架、並飛城區投彈後·形勢轉趨緊張溫台防守司令部已命令泊溫外輪、限於昨午駛出甌江、並禁阻任何船隻進口、宣告封鎖交通、謀福輪業於昨晨駛滬、並由滬駛溫之德平、哈納·飛康·海福·等四輪、均臨時折回、但昨日日方未有動靜、如局勢轉鬆、可望卽行開放、茲探誌各情如下、</p>
<p>當局宣吿封鎖甌江</p>
<p>自日艦日機一再在浙東沿海各地肆行騷擾後、華軍當局、爲加强防務、鞏固地方起見、曾先後將定海·海門·鎭海等各口、宣告封鎖、但爲維持滬浙交通、故溫州之甌江、仍予開放、以利航運、茲以甌江口外突於前日駛來日艦四艘、停泊烏里洋面、並一度向黃華關要塞砲轟、回時日機三架、復飛城區、投彈轟炸、（按日機投彈消息、經航業界多方電詢證實、昨報載不確說、係屬誤傳、）致溫州形勢、突趨緊張、本市航業界昨接電告、謂溫台防守司令部業已命令各輪公司、限留溫外輪、於廿三日（卽昨日）中午一律駛出甌江、並禁阻任何船隻進口故甌江交通、業已宣告封鎖、</p>
<p>謀福昨晨離溫駛滬</p>
<p>德商禮和洋行之謀福輪、於本月十力日由滬駛溫、廿一日抵達該埠、正在裝貨、原定今日返滬、自接當局通知後、即提早於咋晨十時二十分啟椗駛出甌江、逕返上海、公司已接船長貝爾格氏電告、該輪將於明晨抵滬、</p>
<p>駛溫外輪一律折回</p>
<p>本市各外輪公司、　前日雖接溫州方面消息、並有甌江即將封鎖之傳說、但因當局尚無正　命令、故原駛各輪、仍照常開航、意商德平·德商哈納·飛康·海福·等四輪、均於昨晨九時前、先後啟椗駛溫、旋於十時許、接得封航電告、卽經分別用無綫電通知各輪折回、並以封航消息、未能十分證實、故囑各輪暫在吳淞口外停泊、候電決定行止、直至下午四時、封鎖消息、業已完全證實、故哈納海福·飛康·德平、均已先後由淞口駛回、</p>
<p>寶利仍泊烏里洋面</p>
<p>意商義華洋行之寳利輪、於二十日下午四時、由滬駛溫、前晨抵甌江口外烏里洋面、突遭日艦攔阻、並派兵登輪施行檢查、揚言溫州現有軍事行動、阻止進口、故該輪遂在口外停泊、以觀動靜、現代社記者昨向該公司探詢、寳利輪昨仍泊烏里洋面、船長曾電大班雷根尼氏報告、但因星期例假、雷氏停止辦公、故內容不詳、須待今日方可明瞭、據華籍職員稱、該輪即將駛回上海、</p>
<p>溫甬情形迄仍安謐</p>
<p>停泊甌江口外之日艦四艘、於前日一度向溫州黃華關要塞開砲轟擊、經駐軍予以猛烈還擊後、日艦企圖、終未得逞、昨溫州方面、竟日平靖、日艦日機、均無動靜、地方秩序、迄仍安謐如恒、至寗波方面、前日雖有日機數架、飛往偵察、但並未投彈、故商市一切、亦均如常、留甬之意商恩德輪、俟核准裝貨後、卽將於日內返滬、</p>
<p>滬浙交通全部斷絕</p>
<p>關於滬浙交通、自戰事後、華軍當局曾指定寗渡之甬江·溫州之甌江·海門之椒江·爲通航口岸、外掄頻繁、貨運極爲發達、自椒江·甬江·先後封鎖、滬浙僅甌江一處、輪隻亦因葡輪被扣减至五艘、茲以甌江亦告封鎖、故滬浙間航運、業已暫告全部斷絕、</p>
<p>局勢稍鬆可望開放</p>
<p>又據現代社記者探悉、溫台防守司令部於昨日起、命令禁阻船隻出入甌江、純爲鞏固要塞防務、防杜日艦騷擾、據航業觀察、此决封鎖、當係臨時性質、甌江封鎖綫之缺口、當不致實行堵塞、蓋滬浙交通、現時僅賴溫州一綫維持、　長期封鎖、影響必距、故預料如局勢稍趨鬆弛、則可望卽行開放、恢復航運、</p>
<h3>干涉懸旗案　外部已提交涉　經向法大使館提出口頭抗議被沒收之國旗今日當可領回</h3>
<p>關於法租界當局干涉界內市民懸旗、引起糾紛一案、除由納稅華人會進行交涉外、本市各團體方面曾聯名電呈重慶外交部、耍求向法國駐華大使館提出抗議予以糾正、並保證以後市民得有懸旗之自由、茲悉咋日各團體已接外部覆電、略稱滬法租界干涉懸旗案、已向法國大使館提出口頭抗議、並要求以後不再干涉縣掛國旗之自由等語、再各商店被沒收之國旅、雖經法租界納稅會派員交涉、已由法當局允予發還、但截至前日下午、尚未發還、昨爲星期、法當局停止辦公、故納稅會將於今日繼續向法當局要求領回、</p>
<h3>海關再向日方交涉　請發還被攫緝私艦　日方雖已充許　何時履行未知</h3>
<p>江海關所有之大小緝私巡艦、自華軍撤離上海後、悉被日海軍攫去、綜計的有二十餘艘之多、以致海關緝私工作、大受影響、昨據可靠外人方面消息、最近英籍稅務司羅福德、向日方提出交涉、要求發還被攫奪之緝私巡艦、現日方已允發還、但至何時得能交還、則尚不知、蓋日方外交上之「諾言」、何時履行常在不可知之列、</p>
<h3>日軍增防滬郊</h3>
<p>駐滬日軍事當局、在二星期前、因長江及華南曁沿京滬滬杭並沿各公路等戰區、游擊隊時出襲擊、將駐滬日偽軍隊紛紛抽調至各處增援、因此滬地防務空虛、昨晨有運輸艦二隻、由吳淞口駛至楊樹消碼頭、裝來台鮮兵一千餘名、用軍用卡車分送滬南·閘北·及虹口市中心等處駐防、該兩運輸艦卸去台鮮兵及軍用物品後、聞將在滬裝運糧食回日本云、</p>
<h3>浦江封銷綫　尙未炸開　現仍隨時施炸　並不限定時間</h3>
<p>十六舖封鎖錢沉船十餘艘、日方因無力起除、施行轟炸、已達數月之久、每隔三五日、浦東西兩岸時聞微弱之轟炸聲、因炸藥力量並不猛烈、故其聲甚微、日方並在沛面派有吊船兩艘、將浦底炸毀鐵件鐵板陸續起出、運回日本、爲數甚夥、至外人方面所傳昨日下午六時至七時、森炸沉船云云、記者準時前往十六舖視察、未聞轟炸聲發出、浦江東西民渡、亦照常往來、並未被阻停駛、據浦邊船夫云、炸船之人員、僅於日間工作、早於天暗時離去、且轟炸向未限定時間、</p>
<h3>外人在虹口經營汽車　日方企圖留難　謂如載有華人搭客　則日軍將加以檢查</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據日文大陸新報載稱、近有暗中經營之公共汽車三輛、行駛於楊樹浦與外白渡橋間、歷十日後、已被日憲兵發現其營業、四月七日、首决見一九三〇年福特式車架之公共汽車一輛、循百老匯路與楊樹浦路行駛、日當局相信此係</p>
<p>外商工廠　載送僱員之私用車輛、未加注意、不久、復有同式汽車兩輛出現、某日、便衣日憲兵一名偕一華人登其中之一車、每人收費六分、而日商華中都市公共汽車公司經營之汽車、於此同一路程中、則收費一角、據調查所得、此等公共汽車</p>
<p>未領執照　但係公共租界警務處滙山捕房「默許」在其轄區內經營、車主與駕駛者均爲外人、沿該路一帶哨兵、因開車者爲西人、相信爲正當外人商號私用者、故准許公共汽車駛過而不加詢問、日方陸海軍當局對於此事、今取嚴重見解、公用公共汽車如載有華人搭客、則將加以檢查、</p>
<h3>白蓮涇　情形不靖　渡輪被阻退回　波口均已封鎖</h3>
<p>由租界至南黃浦面各渡口、除周家渡·南碼頭·等處渡輪照常行駛外、白蓮涇六里橋渡輪、甫於最近恢復、詛料二十三晨、由租界開往渡船、均被阻退回、據悉、白蓮涇六里橋一帶、述日情形頗爲不安、各波口均已實施封鎖、渡輪停頓、故往來者已發生困難、周家渡南碼頭大碼頭各渡口、戒備亦均加緊、對往來渡客、檢查頗嚴、</p>
<p>僞水巡所或將流產　偽維新政府綏靖部組織之水巡幹部訓練所、所址即在南市江南造船所內、正在積極招生、預定下月一日開學、不料昨晚（二十二日）突遭便衣隊襲擊、格斃偽敎練官及偽警數名、及日軍聞警趕到、便衣隊已不知去向、衆料偽所遭此打擊、或將流產、</p>

<h3>徐家滙天文臺（一）</h3>
<p>— 湯銘和</p>
<p>（一）創設</p>
<p>徐家匯天文臺，創設迄今，已經六十五年了。牠是遠東最早設立的現代科學化的天文臺，爲什麼說是「現代科學化」呢？這是因爲在牠未設立前，遠在十七世紀，在北平已經有天主敎傳敎士利瑪竇，湯若望，南懷仁等先後介紹西洋數學和天文到中國，就在明末淸初的時期，我國的故都已有觀象台的創設了。游過故都的人，大槪還能記得故宮博物館中所陳列的那些儀器吧。</p>
<p>在十九世紀末葉的時候，上海的商埠，漸漸繁榮起來了，進出口船隻也多起來了。可是這些船隻，常常被颶風所毀。東亞的颶風，的確鬧過不少的慘禍，就是近年來颶風仍舊在浩刦着東亞的人類。最近颶風不是在菲列賓又闖過大禍嗎？那時上海的萬國商會就請求天主敎的神甫Deehevreus設立一個觀象台來進行預測颶風的工作。</p>
<p>這位神甫，就毅然答應了，但是有一個條件，那就是要讓這個將要產生的觀象台免費拍發電報，因爲一個觀象台必須和別的觀象台互通生氣，互相報告氣象記錄的。這要求當時就由電報局當局允許。在一八七三年遠東最初的現代天文台，就在上海的徐家滙創立。</p>
<p>（二）發展氣象預測</p>
<p>徐家滙天文台的主要工作是氣象報告，歷來對於航海界的供獻，非常顯著，他和五十餘個氣象報告台（有的在太平洋中，有的是中國沿海的海關報告站，有的是內地的政府報告站，有的是其他國外報告站。）和海洋中的商船，軍艦取得密切的聯絡。每日可以從各處接到二百餘個氣象報告，並且每天四次將所得的氣象情况向外放發。</p>
<p>遇到颶風臨近上海的時候，天文台特派神甫到法租界外灘的信號樓守候，預備接見船長並且答覆他們的詢問。等到颶風到埠的時候，在外灘就可以聽到警號的聲音。近二十年來，警告可以從無綫電傳佈了。天文台和其他發報台的聯絡，也利用無綫電了，有綫電報一天一天的少用了。</p>
<p>在已往五六十年，至少有一千幾百决的颶風發現在中國海岸，因了徐家滙的警報工作，不知已經使多少船隻免難。軍艦，船公司，海員都紛紛向那天文台道謝。要是你到徐家匯天文台去的話，走進屋子，你便會看到牆上掛着一張英國兵艦H.M.S.Kent的照片，在照片角上由艦長寫着道謝的話。這不過是掛在那裹的許多嘉許那天文台的照片中的一張。因爲記者特別注意那張，並且把寫着字念了一念，所以在這裹提出作爲一個實例罷了。</p>
<p>標準時刻</p>
<p>徐家滙天文台還進行着計算標準時刻而向外用無綫電播發的工作。時刻可以計算到百分之一秒那樣準確，每日播送的時候，是正午和晚上九時。在港內的船隻，就可以因此糾正船上的時計。</p>
<p>現在那天文台有二架新式的時計儀，藏於溫度和氣壓不變的地窖中，每日的錯誤，不會超過百分之一秒的，除了作爲記時報時的用處外，還作研究之用。國祭天文協會（International　Astrouomical　Union）曾經議決，在地球上規定三個地方作爲標準時計處，徐家滙天文台，是其中的一處。其餘二處，是菲洲的亞爾基（Algiers）和美國加州的聖地亞哥（San　Diego），從一九二六年十月起，已經開始工作。</p>
<p>地球電磁學的研究，在東亞也要算徐家滙天文台最早了，因爲在上海有電軍，對於磁力研究發生困難，所以在一八七七年就費了數天的工夫，把儀器移到茶葭浜。在過去五六十年中，關於地磁變遷記錄得很詳細。一九二二年中國政府曾經吩咐海關與日本科學家合作調查沿海地磁狀况，所用的儀器和技術人員，大都由菉葭浜地學部供給的。</p>
<p>徐家滙天文台還有地震　器的設備，雖然設立得最晚，但是儀器倒很精妙。有維希式（Wieehert）水平動儀一架，和加里津式（Galitzin）垂直儀器一架，所以徐家滙在世界地震研究中，佔有十分重要的位置。巳往十餘年，最重要的記錄，是華北的兩次大地震。</p>
<h3>平衡基金管委會成立　法幣價値益穏　國際貿易好轉現金準備充足　充寶外滙基金加強抗戰力量</h3>
<p>財政部向英商滙豐·麥加利·及中國·交通·等四銀行借款一千萬鎊後、組織平衡基金管理委員會、法幣價値、更趨穩定、外滙基金、益見充實、整個金融、愈告安定、抗戰力量、更見加强、有益各國對華貿易、茲誌群情如下、</p>
<p>法幣發行政策審愼</p>
<p>中·中·交·農·四行法幣之發行政策、特別審愼、發行額在二十六年六月、爲十叫萬零七百萬元、二十七年六月、爲十七萬二千七百萬元、計增加三萬萬元、有人謂此即係通貨膨脹之例證、實則抗戰重心內移以後、兩廣川滇等省改用法幣、商業信用收縮，而改用現款交易、淪陷區內偽券充斥、增大法幣之窖藏熱度、以及因商品供需失調、致物價高漲、籌碼需要加增、皆爲法幣發行必須增加之理由、上海方面反感通貨緊縮之現象、如滙劃貼水之高漲、是以政府未曾濫發法幣、能使法幣價値、維持於不墜、</p>
<p>人民擁護準備充足</p>
<p>法幣政策施行以後、人民一致表示擁護、抗戰發生、法幣之高低、即爲個人財力之消長、允對之發生熱烈情感、除極少數喪心病在之投機者外、莫不願法幣基礎鞏固、利國利己、皆以用法幣換外匯爲可恥、至於法幣之現金準備、始終在百分之六十以上、我國存美國之美金、至去年六月底止、估計尚有八千四百萬美金、此旣爲外滙之準備、則法幣在外滙之價値、盤旋於目前滙率之間、常不致有巨大之起跌、目下尚餘留國內之存銀數、能運用共半、其能力可以增發法幣二萬萬元以外、同時且可繼續維持現行外匯率二年以上、</p>
<p>管理收效貿易好轉</p>
<p>中央銀行管理外滙審核事宜後、對於正當商業上之需要、儘量供給、對於意圖投機營利者、不予批准，因之資金逃避之門、爲之閉塞、出口貿易所獲之外滙、均按法價售與政府銀行、進口洋貨漲價而减少輸入、更於我國際收支有益、加以政府提倡戰時消費節的運動甚力、有數月且有出超之現象、同時華僑激於愛國熱忱、匯款激增、使我國際收支上，不致發生劇烈之變動、此於法幣價値之維持、雖似間接、實亦頗爲有力、</p>
<p>中外銀行協助維持</p>
<p>我國銀行界在戰時贊助政府、安定金融之功、實屬不可湮沒、而友邦各銀行協同維持外滙之力、當亦係共鑒之事實、每决外滙市塲發生波瀾之時、中外銀行率即拋售大批外滙、結果使法幣價値仍復趨於穩定、去年十月間、廣州武漢、相繼陷落時、法幣滙市、絲毫不受影響、且因以前逃往香港之資金、紛紛流回上海之故、法幣滙價、反而上漲、使日偽之百計破壞法幣計劃、終告失敗、淪陷區域以內法幣依然流通、價値反在偽鈔之上、</p>
<h3>法僑招待　戈斯默</h3>
<p>據二十三日法文上海日報載、昨晚（二十二）法國總會內、曾舉行茶會、以招待法國駐華大使戈斯默、聞當時到者、來賓甚多、均由該總會主席達商律師出而招待、聞在昨晚茶會時、各方均有演說、互致敬意、而法大使之演辭、允諄諄於勸告駐滬法僑之一致團結、以渡難局、據法大使戈斯默稱、彼以前來華、多留駐北平、在滬尚不熟悉、惟對於上海法僑之工作、素所欽佩云、又聞昨晚茶會時、法國總領事鮑黛斯、因事未出席、</p>
<h3>法租界當局允許　擴展工廠區域　展至筆家匯路但不准開夜工　各廠要水電公司減代電費</h3>
<p>法租界當局、鑒於戰區內各業工廠、紛紛遷入租界開工、故指定距離鬧市較爲偏僻之康悌路·薛華立路·福履理路·近南之金神父路·亞爾培路·拉都路·等處、爲工廠區域、但戰後、市面畸形發展、除老廠逐漸增加外、而新廠亦日見添設、致原有廠區狹窄、特由廠商聯請法租界當局設法寬放、以維工業、該項請求、業經法當局允許展長至西段、如徐家滙·祁齊路·貝當路·謹記橋北堍、（即徐家滙路一帶）以上路段、使用電力機器之工廠、可以設立、不用電力機器之手工業廠塲區域、則並不限制、</p>
<p>住宅區域不准開夜工</p>
<p>關於工廠區域、經法租界當局核准擴充後、因所寬放之地段、地處遍西、均係住宅區域、允以外人住居者較多、是以規定在徐家滙一帶所設立工廠、不准開夜工、以免喧雜、曾經木市國貨聯合會、及法租界納稅華人會、分別向法當局磋商、予以通融、均無法變通、</p>
<p>各廠要求減低電力費</p>
<p>界內各業工廠、近因法商水電公司突然增加電費百分之二十五、不勝負據、故各廠方面、曾與公司當局口頭提出要求减低、迄無答覆、現悉各該業工廠、陳述困難情形、已分別請求國貨團體、代向該公司交涉取消加價、吾則亦將原議加價之數額、即予减低、以維工商、</p>

<h3>歷代書畫展　觀賞後書所感</h3>
<p>— 肇平</p>
<p>—足以發揚民族意識—</p>
<p>中國歷代書畫展覽會，為擴大醫藥救護運動，在大新四樓舉行，我曾兩次抽閒去觀覽，對於歷代著名作家超登藝術最高峯的許多名貴作品，千秋自有定評。母用我來贅說。現在我所要說的，是此會在各方面的精神表現。</p>
<p>藏家的精神表現我國一切收藏家，都犯有錮藏自喜，靳不示人的通病，此次該會展覽，出品人如龐虛齋，溥西園，吳湖帆，劉海粟，丁惠康諸氏，都是著名的收藏家。作品人如宋代的蘇·黃·米·蔡，元末四大家的黃·吳·王·倪，明代四大家的沈·唐·文·仇，淸代著名的四王，都有他們足以代表一代和一生的傑作·以如此有名藏家，推獻如此有名作品，實為歷屆書畫展覽所未有；推原其故，完全是由於各大收藏家的熱心公益，所以能一破舊習，而有這種公開的精神表現。我希望社會上一切收藏家從今以後，都能把此會做榜樣，慨出珍藏，公開展覽，那在推進學術文化，以及造福社會上，是功德無量的。</p>
<p>作家的精神表現個人的藝術，足以表現個人的精神，一國的藝術，也足以表現一國的精神；所以個人藝術上的成就，他的自然婦向，不僅是個人的精神不死，而且是千萬年國魂之所繫。常此國難臨頭，河山破碎，疆塲健兒，正在灑然血，拚頭頣，爭取最後勝利，但是一角孤島，正不知有多少人酣歌恒舞，過那麻醉生活；又不知正有多少人，暗地裹屈膝事仇，嘗那奴隸滋味，幾乎要使人痛哭國魂何在！現在該會在這樣的氛圍中舉行，雖然主旨在擴大醫藥救隊，同時我可說還含有兩個很重大的意義：一，是藉歷代古人遺續，來表示民族之魂，使我們覺醒綿延這個民族之魂的貴任重大，再也不能醉生夢死；一是作品中有許多忠義節烈炳若日月的人，與其說展示他們的遺績，母寗說展示他們的人格。如我們看了明末黃道周的字，和倪元璐的畫，便聯想到他們兩位當日的忠肝義膽，大節凛然，使我們的精神，頓時興奮起來，覺得我們應當盡我們本位的責任，雖不能人人做戰死疆塲的健兒，至少也要自保人格，做一個寗為玉碎，不為瓦全，大節無虧的完人。所以在一角孤島的今日，尤其是政府領導全國精神總動員的今日，該會有此展覽，不但是表現民族的偉大精神，而且是展示黃帝干孫個別的偉大人格，眞是給予今日孤島人士最需要的一種精神食糧。</p>
<p>觀衆的精神表現　我兩次到該會觀覽，會塲中都擠滿了人，在這個吃飯不易的年頭，大家願意化錢，一方面固然是大家在藝術上不肯錯過這樣一個難得的可供欣賞和研究的機會，另一方面，我想根木便是捐助醫藥救護難胞的一念所推動，所以觀衆有這樣的踴躍，這種仁愛互肋的精神表現，擴而充之，又何事不成呢？</p>

<p>兩性衛生</p>
<h3>性知識能導我們　跨進愛的樂園！</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>意大利著名學者哈希曼氏HIitchmaund這樣說:「假若我們要安穩地步入愛的樂園，那末必要一種性學識來作我們前進的領導。」這種性學識是有關夫婦幸福的健康秘訣，當每個靑年在生理成熟時，就很需要。</p>
<p>兩性健康的範圍實甚廣泛，其中對於性病的研究，及關於性的一切知識，因為與吾人日常的生活上有密切的關係，故屬特別重要。</p>
<p>在新潮流澎湃的現代社會。靑年因為缺乏性的知識，於至縱慾斵傷，引起不應有的煩惱，絕身陷於痛苦之中，不僅損及自身的健康，而且危及夫婦間的愛情，這一點，靑年應該要萬分留意纔是。</p>
<p>如果曉得精液就是生命，健康就是愛情的話，那來不宜過分縱慾，所以靑春時期的衛生，不能漠視，普通都能正常發育，其原因因為靑春腺能分泌一種液體，這種液體含有促進全身新陳代謝的作用，並且有益於性器部分的發育之故，若自凟斵傷，或荒淫自戕，每喪失此種分泌液，不僅新陳代謝遲鈍，發育中止，且連帶使性機能削弱，早洩，陰痿，陷入陣陣痛苦之中，結果，妻對你怨恨，對你咀咒，同時還能引起她瞧不起你的心理，美滿良緣從此立告破產，此誠寃由自作！</p>
<p>當余在美國時，已明瞭此種疾病，祗有積極使用內分泌療法，方可使其着手回春。回國後在臨床上屨顯奇效，惟內分泌中效果最佳者，首推睪丸精質製劑「補體康」，因其功效持久，服後性機能馬上活潑亢進，解除神經衰弱，增進發育，同時增進全身營養，余曾將該藥加以化騐，發現藥力在服後六十分鐘內即已開始，二十四小時內即從事生精益血的工作，其女用「補體康」功能調經種子，同為夫婦衰弱者健身妙品。</p>
<h3>鎭咳與治癆</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>要知今日之咳嗽，如不速療，即為來日之肺癆，雖有現代科學療法，可以制伏之，但不容諱言，對於治療之時間金錢，均不免有大大的延長耗費，故十全之醫治，治咳嗽實為光着，但不幸在咳嗽時期失去醫治，而爆發肺病時，則「補肺拿爾」一藥，對於治療肺病，尤有特效，查木劑具有純粹之殺減結核菌之良效，蓋此為徒梅博士盡多年心血研究，採用礦植物之貴重成分，而屢次又加以動物試騐逐步改良所成功，故「補肺拿爾」功效極其純正，其所奏之迅速鎭咳化痰功效並非一般僅有一時性之麻醉性可此。</p>

<p>强橫而跳梁之淋菌，歷來不知犧牲幾許人類的生命，拆散幾許夫妻之幸福，而我醫界中人，亦無不孜孜研究，想要實現淋病之特效藥，而終未獲成功。良由一般學者，不知淋菌生活之情形，僅憑不正確之學說，粗淺之技術常然永難達到實現之目的也。</p>
<p>原來我人之被淋毒所害之病原菌，即雙球菌，抵抗甚大，能耐高度之熱及低度之冷，並有反抗弱性之抗毒力。所以淋病患者。往往感到無藥可治之困境。其實現在此一困難問題，現已得到完全根木肅淸，因德國彼德傳士根據細菌學及免疫學之研究，深知淋菌在吾人體內生活狀態，而根據一種非特異性療法，採用蛋白質黃色素混合裝成淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，此劑服後能于數小時內，體內細菌，發生一種抗淋噬菌作用，以奔赴病灶，包圍剿滅之。所以一般市上成藥，治療所未能奏功者，「克淋儂」絕對可以根本治愈之。此為余素屢試而不爽者。如能一方更用「抗淋水」作洗滌尿道部分之淋菌，女子淋毒性白帶，以肅淸帶濁，而迅速恢復其已靡爛之陰道，然後頑强而猖在之淋病，即可根絕矣！余自美國返國以還，治愈淋病，不知多少。敢以經騐所得，竭誠奉告病家。</p>
<h3>關於女子的自凟行為</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>靑年因生理上之需要，又因環境的不良，意志的薄弱，而致走入性的岐途，犯上自凟的惡習者，為數固屬不少，就是在生理成熟的女性方面，犯此者亦是指不勝屈，但關於女子的自凟行為，實無從調查，而且女性因生理上的不同，就是自凟以後，所發現的弊害，不若男子的易以顯現，故女子可以過度地慣行自凟，同時女子羞恥心校男子為重，雖受自凟之害，但也諱莫如深，因此之故，竟有人以女子的犯上自凟為驚奇，大有不加信任之概，不過這種人，大都對於生理衛生不加研究者，至於醫學界的人士，已早知女子犯此者的與日俱增，　認為女性健康幸福的一大威脅。</p>
<p>講到女子自凟的動機，大都因性的不滿足，或因性器發炎等啟發了自凟的動機。關於女子自凟後最大的弊害，就是陰脣脹大，陰核受損，而致罹不感症，此外之子宮發炎，身體衰弱，乳房痿癟，面容失艷，月經不調，亦皆因過度的自凟所引起，其嚴重情形不下於男子的自凟遺精也。我今忠告於自療女子，應速戒絕。服以女用「補體康」以增進健美，調整月經，該劑為卵巢內分泌之最佳者，頗具着手回春之妙，如男子因犯自凟而喪失健康者，可服男用「補體康」，以培補虧損，如有遺精，可兼服「耐而斯遺精片」。</p>

<h3>白濁與攝護腺液之害</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所…寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>大家皆知吾人之生命的起始，在於睪丸內所製出之精子。蓋精子爲生物生命之原素也。而不知尚有與精虫立於同等地位之重要者。即攝護腺液是。此攝護腺炎是精虫生命所寄托，尚無攝護腺液，則精虫即失去其活動之能力，而乾涸以死。故攝攝護腺液對於生殖上之重要性，僅次於精子。</p>
<p>淋病一症，因其病原菌之凶暴，毒素之瀰蔓，容自易侵入攝護腺而成攝護腺炎一成淋毒性攝護腺炎，即有失姙絶嗣之危險。是不可不急速治療也。余自臨床以來，已届念載，對於淋毒性攝護腺炎，有特殊之經騐，因爲攝護腺之器官，處于侵入生殖器官之要衝，故處理得當，並非難事。余恒用德國静電療法，使其殺菌力量，直達病灶，更投以淋病聖藥，「克淋儂」，以根本解决附緣內部之淋菌。因「克淋儂」乃黄色素蛋白體混合製成，所以具有抗淋噬菌的作用，而昂進全體細胞，包圍所有之淋菌，使其毫無漏網逃竄之可能，因而破壞生殖機能之攝護腺炎，完全治愈。是以攝護腺重行恢復固有之分泌機能而絶嗣之痛苦，保證可以脱離。此爲余二十餘年來所經騐，從無失敗之例也。　診時：上午十時至下午六時。星期日下午停診。自即日起每天送診二十號，每號僅取金五角。</p>

<h3>本刊第二次座談紀錄　平衡物價問題（座談紀錄之一）　物價何以高漲？</h3>
<p>日期　本月十六日上午十時起</p>
<p>地點　本報五樓會議廳</p>
<p>出席者　程紹德　張素民　余定義　王海波　掌牧民　聶光地　王雨桐　朱斯煌　魏友棐　汪孚禮　史惠康　章午雲　趙簡子　沈真一　張一凡（李　）　徐鼎臣（李　）　吳觀周（李　）　李權時　劉星晨　潘仰堯　孫禮榆</p>
<p>張一凡：今天蒙各位先生犧牲休息機會，參加敝刋關於物價問題的座談會，十分榮幸。當前物價這樣地飛漲，問題已不限於消費者感受壓迫，生產者也感受壓迫，不僅有關國民生計，而且有關整個國民經濟與整個戰時經濟的前途、無論國民為了國家，願意忍受一切犧牲。但是在可能範圍，我們也該充分設法輕减國民經濟力的浪費。最近中央已有實施平衡國內物價的決心和計劃；但上海情形特殊，除了民間各自負担起國民戰時的天職，共同進行穩定物價的工作，此外恐就只有坐視物價，繼長增高，戰時中的上海，在全國經濟上的地位，雖已較戰前跌落不少，但支配全國經濟的勢力，依然不可輕視。我們可以從許多事實上看到上海的物價在支配着內地物價。像紗花便是一端。上海環境特殊，中央政策已不能充分發揮作用。直到現在，民間對高物價的壓迫，又只在消極與忍耐。這雖是値得佩服的精神，但畢竟太消極；為將來設想，又畢竟太危險，所以我們站在國民的立塲，站在學術界的立塲，應該來想想辦法，提倡提倡·這便是敝刋所以把這個問題作為這决座談重心的一番熱忱。敝刋旣覺得在今日的上海該平衡物價，非山各業協力即不能有所作為，所以對於邀請名單，曾費一番攷慮。像各位先生，都是對於各業，各簡品，以至一般物價，皆有特殊研究的專家·非特都有豐富的經騐，而且都飽藏豐富的經濟學識。此外還有林康侯·朱博泉·姚慶三·•潘恒勤·劉鐵孫·謝菊曾·朱耕莘等幾位先生，雖因今天另有他約，未能參加；但他們都有書面意見，敝刋是十分感激的。現在先請各位先生替物價把把脈息：</p>
<p>魏友棐：我以為今日國內物價高漲，可分兩方面觀察；在都市方面，即在條約口岸方面，交通多半還很順利；所以物資調整也比較容易，與內地不同。因此都市物價上漲的原因：（一）暗市匯價貶低，而都市中物資大多數和外滙有關，所以無形中使都市物價上漲。（二）內地交通隔絕，土產不能暢運來滬。（三）其他如偽祖織加稅等，也是一個原因。至於內地物價的高漲，多半由於物資不足，與調整失宜。其他原因的支配成分尚少。戰時此種物價上漲，似乎說不到民生有益與否的問題，但可以說對國內工業的發展，是一個有利的環境。至於物價的平衡，在上海似乎談不到，在內地還在於講求節約，及擴充自己的生產力。民間的自治統制辦法，我想也只有從事於節約運動，戰時民衆立塲上本應該如此。</p>
<p>章午雲：自戰後迄今，物價繼續升漲，論者多謂由於外匯猛縮所致，事實上恐尙不完全如此，因商品之漲價，並不一律，如米即未大大漲價，紗之上落亦不以外匯為依歸也。就上海而言，物價上漲共有四項原因，第一為生產减少，如棉紗一項戰前內地紗廠，目下均已停工，即楊樹浦一帶之紗廠，亦僅外商開工，以致各地所需棉紗，均非取給於上海租界以內之紗廠不可，故交通如不阻斷，紗價即扶搖直上，曾一度至每包五百元，後囚交通阻斷始告下落，其他製造品，亦有同樣趨勢。第二為供給减少，如棉花因內地淪陷不能源源來滬，且為日人大批收買，以致棉花在滬價格步步抬高，此外如生牛皮桐油等等亦如此，又如米於前年戰事，方離上海之時，曾因來源阻斷，飛漲至二十元以上，雖統制亦無效，後因來源疏通，去年度且常在十二元左右，反較統制之價格為低，可見來源之阻斷與吾，與物價大有關係也。第三由於人口之然中，上海自戰後為避難人口集中之地，一切消費數量，大為擴大故消費物品之價格，如菜蔬藥品等等，無不升漲。第四由於外匯黑市塲之成立，外匯價格縮至八便士左右，因此進口貨價格隨之上漲，出口貨亦因匯兌有利步步上漲，如絲繭等是也。集此四因遂造成今日物價上漲之現象，就大體而言，似尚未完全以外匯之價格為依據，此則由於物品本身之供需，有時亦非外匯所能左右者也。總之，此次物價之上漲以生產减少為最大原因，其他原因尚在其次。</p>
<p>程紹德：上海物價增加的原因，直接受通貨影響的比絞少。因戰後上海通貨並未如何增加，某種時期，且發生收縮狀態。如安定金融辦法的推行，政府限制運鈔來滬。且以通貨流通速度觀之：上海戰後市塲籌碼流通量及其流通率遠不及戰前。即以上海銀行票據交換數目論，戰前有每日高至三千萬元上下，現在最高數僅千萬元左右。但上海物價難不直接受通貨上的影響，但間接上，却有二個影響的：（一）外匯下跌，進口物價上漲。因之間接提高一部分的國貨價格。（二）人口增加，貨物來源缺乏。通貨與貨物不平衡，物價乃比例的上漲。然此非全由通貨數量。至於上海物價的高漲原因：（一）來源統制與缺乏。（二）沿途運滬時租稅增加。（三）生產成木貴：（四）外匯下跌，進口貨貴，間接影響於一部份國貨：（五）商人居奇。（六）市場心理所造成。根據剛才各位專家報告的各種貨物價格增高的原因，便可歸納成上列的結論裹。救濟辦法，一方靠輿論提倡；他方靠同業公會自治。然只能消除商人居奇，和市場心理不安的兩個原素，對於其他貨物價增加的原因，不能收若何效果的。</p>
<p>王雨桐：戰時國內物價，尤以上海一地之物價，以供求失常為最中要原因。復以政府之厲行統制外匯，引起黑市塲匯市之劇烈變動，促成畸形上漲。據調查所得，（一）重要之農產品二十四種，上漲者達二十二種之多，其中最著者為綠茶，烟葉，桐油，生絲，最近之生油，豆油，黃豆，（二）重要之工業品九種，上漲者以進口貨之顏料，化學原料，五金，紙張等商品之漲勢為最厲，布疋棉紗次之，（三）重要之礦產品七種，無一不漲，尤以煤之漲勢最厲，如開灤煤漲至百分之一百五十，上列各物價格，漲率最高者在一五○％以上，最少亦在一○％以上，昂貴原因，約有五點，而以第五點為最令人注目：計（一）交通梗阻，來源不暢，（二）大批貨品，陷於戰區或內地，無法運來，致供不應求，（三）產區被毀，來源斷絕，（四）政府統制外匯，黑市塲滙市奇縮，商人乘機居奇，（五）最近之豆油生油市價之飛漲，因貨物之供給，其權已不在我，而為他人所操縱。加以業中敗類，推波助瀾，從中牟利。</p>
<p>趙簡子：剛才各位對於物價昂騰的原因，分析很詳盡，兄弟聽到許多宏論，非常欽佩，但兄弟以為根據經濟學的見地，當前物價昂騰的原因，可以歸納為（一）通貨方面及（二）商品方面的原因。本來依貨幣數量的學說，法幣發行量不膨脹，幣値便不低落。但我國從實施法幣至統制外滙止：發行量雖節節增加，但幣値不動，這是為了舊幣廢止，而以法幣替代之故，共時物價指數雖也回昇，此非通貨景氣，乃受世界物價上漲的影饗。戰時法幣的發行額雖也相常增加但仍與常前的物價上漲無關。因為現在廣束，廣西，雲南，貴州，乃至西康，都先後採用法幣。流通區域擴大，法幣發行跟需嬰增加而增大，絕非所謂通貨膨脹。淪陷區域以及內地我國法幣被毀於砲火的，為數亦不少；戰時後，商業信用停放，改用現款交易，這也是增大了法幣流通的需要。總之，戰後法幣由於市場流通額的擴大，從而增加了法幣的發行額，但這不能作為物價昂騰的反證·那慶，戰後物價高騰的原因在那裹呢？這就如各位所說的，如商品供需失調，奸商囤積居奇，交通梗塞，運輸遲滯，等等，這可以婦納為商品方面的原因。此外，兄弟認為促進物價高騰之原因還有一種，就是公共捐稅，即如課稅，兵險等。</p>
<p>張素民：物價上漲問題，上海與內地不同；上海物價上漲之原因，在國貨係為供求失調，或為原料之减少，或為內地產品來源之减少：在進口貨係為國幣對外滙價之下落，至於上海並無通貨膨脹之事實，財政當局對於上海係採緊縮政策；此為人所共知老者，至於內地物價上漲之主要原內，亦為供求之失調，內地所用之製造品，向來恃長江一帶廠家之供給，長江一帶淪陷之後，來源或則斷絕，或則運輸困；故價格自漲，至內地一地方之土產品，在當地並不一定上漲，惟在別一地方，亦因運輸困難而上漲，至於內地進口品，因政府統制甚嚴，除軍用品外，消費品之進口，在內地幾已絕跡。此外內地所產之大宗輸出品，如茶葉，桐油，等全為政府所壟斷，供輸出之用。故留為民間之用者為量無多。其價自漲，惟統制物價殊不易言。因物價問題複雜，須分別各個物價以實施統制。就上海言，除米價已由租界當局統制外，其餘物價，恐非租界當局所能統制。至內地物價統制各地方多有實行者。</p>
<p>潘仰堯：內地和上海的物價，近兩年都在上漲。而內地漲勢尤甚。原因是（一）運輸困難，有時運費比成本貴過幾倍。（二）匯兌關係，財部限制申匯極嚴。這在防資本流入淪陷區內所必要的手段。現在中中交農四行對申滙款，每行每天至多以五千元為度。因此匕海廠商運貨到內地而匯款回滬時，不但滙價高到每千元在百元以上（滙劃約一百十元，劃款約一百六十元，）且甚不易；於是物價也因之上漲。（三）內地又在統制貿易，抽收外來貨稅，無形中亦使物價高漲。（四）交通阻礙，日機襲擊不定，轉運上的危險性較鉅。所以內運貨少。而冒險運往者，自不免因之居奇。（五）政府除統制匯兌外，又把許多商品列入統制範圍，因此商人以無利可圖，不願販賣。故來源日稀，造成求過於供，形成漲勢。（六）許多內外工廠的原料，都仰給外國，跟外滙跌落，故其成本也日貴，在上海，又因人口驟增一倍，各種社會又畸形發達，所以物價的上漲原因，更見複雜了。但自內地限制申滙後，外地貨運入內地後，以匯款不合算，頗多採辦內地貨運出外邊，故無形中亦有限制物價繼續上漲的可能。不過這力量很微細。</p>
<p>聶光地：關於戰後物價高漲的原因很多，各位的宏論很詳盡。本人願意補充一點意見。我以為物價的高漲，供求數量失調固然是其主因，而交通阻滯，運輸困難，使貨物的裝運發生種種不便，也容易促成物價的上漲。拿農產品來說吧，往往有某地出產豐富，供過於求，而價格低落；而同時另一地方，需要正殷，來源不暢而市價飛騰。但是這兩處地方因運輸不便，而不易得到供求的調劑。</p>
<p>內地滙水高昂，影響運入內地各貨的成本。譬如重慶滙上海款項的滙水每千元要一百餘元，商人到上海來辦貨運到重慶，貨價成本內勢必加入此二成滙水，賣價當然也隨之帶高。再者沿途和人境所征付的各種捐稅為數也不小，加上一路所投保的運輸和兵險，貨價怎能不高？剛才有一位先生提起外滙影響物價，這點當然也是原因之一。可是我以為外滙緊縮影響於國內出產的原料者少而於造成品者居多，進口的洋貨更不用說了。比仿內地許多產米之區，戰前米價每担七八元的現在仍不過如此，並沒有因為法幣對於外滙的在縮而漲價。再比仿設七七事變以後，隴海路一帶產棉之區因無人購買而棉價慘跌，可是在上海漢口等地紡織廠出品紗布郤日趨高漲。此中供求關係最大：但是紡織廠的機器配件以及五金物料都要用外滙結付，所以製成品的成本價格多少也要因此提高。所以我以為外滙對於國內物價的影響，似乎是間接的成份居多。</p>
<p>通貨對於物價的影響很大，剛才已有幾位先生提起。戰後我國政府法幣的發行數額雖相當增加，但是上海市面上流通的籌碼不獨不及戰前的多，而且似乎較為緊縮。但是國人因為預防通貨膨漲或根本對於法幣發生懷疑而囤積貨物的很多，再加商人從中興風作浪，操縱居奇，促成許多物品的上漲，正如剛才主席先生所說的，一種直錢式的上漲。所以我以為上海許多物品的漲價，外行的囤積，內行（即商人）的操縱居奇的影響很大。</p>
<p>不論物價高漲的原因怎樣，漫無止境的漲上去是不對的，對於社會的安寗，平民的生計，都有嚴重的影響。就拿上海來說吧，五百餘萬人口背面所蘊藏着的問題就很多。我覺得我們應該研究出一個方案來限制這物價的高漲。</p>
<p>李權時：要平衡內地的物價，需先解決貨運上的交通綫。要平衡上海的物價，應疏散上海的人口。如果要請同業公會出而自動統制，那簡直是與虎謀皮。他們對於國難財正發得起勁；誰願意推開自己的發財機會？而且像奢侈品之類，儘可不必平衡，讓他上漲好了。因為上漲得太貴了，自然會發生節約作用。物價也就自然下降。其實就是想法平衡也沒有用的。</p>
<p>掌牧民：物價平穩，民而獲利很大。但非有政治力量不可。上海旣不能運用政治力量。非靠各方合作，實行自治統制不可。但上海的物價上漲原因以操縱居奇為中因。由商人操縱，由商人自治統制。效力自然很少。其實上海物價的上漲，就是聽其自然也不妨。因為人口集中於上海，是不合理的事。不過日用必須品昂貴，於社曾經濟前途，究屬太危險不過的。</p>
<p>王海波：戰時物價高漲的原因極多譬如上海與內地交通斷絕，這是交通原因；法幣在黑市場中跌價到八便士，是外滙原囚；上海人口突然增加到五百萬是人口原因；運費保險利息等項高漲，是成本原因；戰時軍用品浩繁，是軍需原因：奸商囤積居奇，是操縱原因；其餘如工廠被燬，製造家勞働家改業，淪陷區城的物品被統制，運輸時苛捐雜稅的繁多等等，這樣分析下去，總有一二十種·不過我們仍可依照經濟學上的普通分類，槪括言之，不外下列三種：（一）需要激增：包括人口軍需儲藏等項：（二）供給銳减：包括工廠被燬，製造者改棄，交通不便，產區陷落等。需要與供給在平時不但是決定價格的原素，而且可以互相調節。可是戰時則不然，需要方面，一直增加：但供給方面，却迅速减少因此需供失去平衡，自然樣失去作用。所以在根本原因未消滅以前，我們只見得物價飛漲。在此嚴重情形下，却又跳出第三個原因·就是交換過程中所發生的毛病。我們知道，平時為交換媒介並為測量物價標準的是貨幣。戰時貨幣價値旣狂跌，則相反方面，物價當然上漲·至於這幾種原因，何種影響大，何種影響輕，我以為未可一槪而論。是錯綜複雜互相消長的·不過當我們研究的時候，可依據三個不同的標準（一）分別品類。如舶來品受外滙的影響大，內地物品受交通的阻碍大，淪陷區貨物受苛捐雜稅統制運輸等原因大。（二）分別區域：如上海與內地之情形迥然不同·上海物價上升迅速，內地則較迂緩，甚至有大大跌價者。（三）分別時間：這包括當時的環境和一般人心理等等，譬如每當軍事順利的時候，物價較為平穩，軍事失利，物價變化迅速。物價研究，是一個非常需要時間和精細分析的工作，我個人的觀察，自然非常淺薄，不過繼括言之，我的意見是：物價高漲的原因，總不外二類（一）需要激增，（二）供給銳减，（三）為交換標準貸幣價格跌落。這三種原因，父隨時隨地隨物而互相消長的。所以我們在研究的時候，亦依照這三個標準，即（一）分別品類，（二）分別區域，（三）分別時間來分析，即可得一個比較正確的結論</p>
<p>朱斯煌：物價上漲的原因，不能一概而論，地域和物品類別的分別，不可忽視。譬如上海物價，不免受通貨影響：而某種勢力，特殊原因，也往往在擾亂市面。至於內地物價之漲，多因交通阻滯之故。所以外來貨價，上海賤於內地；國產物價，內地賤於上海。還有一點，也很重要。在通常情勢裹，物價的穩定，在供需雙方勢力的均衡。但物價下跌時，决定力以需要方面佔優勢。物價上漲時，決定力以供給方面佔優勢。現在物價上漲的趨勢旣成，供方之囤積居奇，投機操縱，實為造成物價更漲的重大原因。再就通貨方面，來證明這種投機操縱的勢力。通常在通貨膨脹時，人民進款，常因之增加。於是刺激日常用品需要，造成物價的上漲，此乃就常例而言。現在中國的戰時通貨，固不能說大量膨脹，然從黑市塲滙價緊縮的情形觀之，膨脹的現象，也不能說沒有。可是現在中國人民的進款，反因各方减薪而緊縮。因此薪給工給等人民用度，反在收縮，消費反見减少。道固然是一方面因為軍事上需要的增加，人民不得不節省物力。但是另一方面，通貨膨脹的結果，完全助長了囤積居奇，投機操縱者的活動。無論在商品市塲，金融市場，都大顯身手，大發其國難財，物價因而抬高。所以就通貨方面所生的影響而言，消費者能發揮的勢力，遠不敵供給者操縱的勢力。所以現在物價的上漲，尤其是在上海，推其原因，供方的勢力，囤積居奇投機操縱最可注意的。</p>
<p>張一凡：把各類物價指數分別觀察，漲起的程度雖頗有上下，可是節節上漲的趨勢是一致的。除了帶投機意味的商品：像現金，公債，紗，花之類的物價進行綫，略帶曲折，其他一槪直綫進行，就是曲綫進行的那幾種物價，除了證券一項之外，其他的趨勢，如以月與月的比較，或季與季的比較，還是一步步漲着的。從大體上說。進口物價是直綫進行，國產品物價是曲錢進行。這用滙價跌落的關係來解釋，是比較合理。如把各類商品的價格之個別的發展趨勢說：那末流通過程上的許多影響物價的理山，便占重要地位，不過滙價在黑市塲開始下降之後，即逐步下趨，到了八便士關口，又即穩定，因此進口物價的上漲趨勢，最初固然應成直綫發展；其後便該有所變化。但事實上是否這樣？希望在座對於各類商品有特殊研究的先生，可否做個詳細的報告？</p>
<p>劉星晨：國內物價變動趨勢，在空間上大有不同，都市問普遍上漲；鄉村裹則普遍下降。貨不能暢其流，這是戰時環境所造成。唯共如此，物價變動中的運輸原因，關係至大。試就個人所知：來做個內地物價的報告，如河南鷄蛋，每元可買一百五十個，魚每元十斤………（編者註，劉先生對此有頗詳之報告及分析，惜紀錄不全，深為歉仄，希劉先生原諒）</p>
<p>汪孚禮：當前物價上漲最烈的商品，也許可以紗布做代表。二十支金城紗會貴到每件五百二元，校戰前漲起一倍多。外滙收縮，運輸困難，以及成本加重等等，固皆有關係。但以紡織廠受戰爭影響，或停或毀，生產减少，供不應求，實為最大主因。關於我國紡織生產設備的受損程度，與目前的情形，兄弟當另行作書面報告（編者註：汪先生之書面報告，業已收到，當於下期本刊發表）。這裹想提請各位注意的，便是應重視這生產不址的事實。</p>
<p>聶光地：　上海和內地不能相提並論：上海的環境是特殊的。大家知道一個作戰的國家，種種主要物品都要受政府統制的。但是上海怎樣呢？上海何嘗像一個國家在生死存亡奮鬬中的城市！普通商人覺得生命已有保障，生財之道，就大發其財，什麼國計民生，似乎不必計較。上海租界以內，我國政府力量現在是達不到，當然談不到什麼統制。租界當局總算對於米價有相當限制，可是其他有關民生的衣和住就任其漲價，毫無辦法。行的方面，戰後電車和公共汽車幸未如何加價；即使要加，我們老百姓有何辦不法？</p>
<p>我以前說過物價高漲，商人居奇是一大原因。茲就紗布而論，無論如何，上海總是棉紗布的生產區域，利用內地急需，上海便高價待沽。廣州失守之前，廠家每件棉紗可以有二百餘元的利潤，現在每件仍可凈盈七八十元。紗布商販進內地，自然又要加上一筆利益；如貨物來源缺乏，更可壟斷居奇。試把一件二十支一棉紗的售價，上海和內地相比較，相差程度是着實可警。比仿上海現在賣每件三百九十餘元，昆明是七百元左右，重慶是八百五六十元，而萬縣是九百五十元，較上海貴一倍多。就祗計算成本，由上海販入內地所需的一切費用，也够駭人的。茲將一件二十支棉紗由上海運至昆明的成本約計舉一個例，此中各項數字雖有時不免或大或小，但也可覘其槪况：</p>
<p>運費連上下力　五十九元五角</p>
<p>稅捐（重征統稅及消費稅）　五十五元一角</p>
<p>沿途虧捐（紗包破碎）（紗支被藕）　八元</p>
<p>棧租及保險　三元七角</p>
<p>匯水及利息　九十三元五角</p>
<p>加上貨本假定是三百九十五元，則到滇成本共需六百十五元，如售價是七百元，可賺八十五元。如運往重慶，每件運費，上下力，雜費等還要加上百五十元，照現在市價，並無利益圖。</p>
<p>余定義：物價上漲的原因，非常複雜，戰前與戰後，內地與上海，國貨與洋貨，內銷與外銷，統制與放任，應綜合的看，也應分別的看。第一，戰前物價上漲主因在貨幣制度之改進，而戰後上漲主因在戰爭之繼續擴大，因為戰爭，生產停頓，供需失調，因為戰爭，運輸困難，成本增加，物價上漲，自屬必然的結果。第二，內地物價上漲的主因在運輸困難，供不應求，而上每則在人口集中，需求激增，表面上眞是共需關係使然，而本質上是不同的，如果內地運輸增加，運費减低，上海人口疏故，物價上漲立刻可以停止。第三，本地主產本地消費的物品，多數是不漲的，如內地的農產品，上海的捲烟，肥皂，在本地不漲，或所漲不大，但外銷則一致飛漲，唯遇人口集中太甚之都市如重慶，昆明，上海等處，內銷亦漲，可稱例外。第四，國貨與洋貨之比較，前者祗生產减少，供不應求而增，後者上漲之主因則在匯價之高昂，同時國貨受洋貨上漲之刺激不免隨之增漲，但程度上也顯然不同。第五，因統制或放任之故，物價上海的趨勢也有分別，如上海米價曾一度漲至二十元，自經以十四元為最高限價後，即停止在十四元關內，其他各物在一般人購買力所及範圍內仍有繼續上漲的趨勢。從上述各槐情形加以分析，物價上漲的原因，可見並不是單純的，綜合起來說，因為生產减少，運輸困難，人口集中，外匯高漲。供需失調，成本增加等等促進物價上漲的條件俱已齊備，才有今日空前高漲的現象。說到平衡物價問題，在積極方面，我們要特別注意生產力之增加，運輸之改進。假若無貨可運，或有貨不能運，抬價居奇，自然不免；在消極面，應提倡節的與勵行物價統制政策，前者而易行，後者較為困難，但非絕不可能，如米價之限制即為一例，一般必需品實有仿行之必要。至於奢侈品不妨暫時的放任，而以其本身價格之上漲為自然之限制，也未嘗不可。此外以輿論力量展開節的運動，促進必需品之價格統制，必可收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>沈眞一：如分別各種物價的上漲內容，要推農產與工業品的上漲程度最高，就本人對於各種商品物價調查所得材料來看，可供各位研究的有下面好幾點：</p>
<p>（一）農產品中烟葉，掊子的最近（本年四月中旬）價格，比戰前要漲起二○○％以上，桐油則漲一八八％，綠茶漲一五○％乾繭漲一二○％，生油漲九三％，棉花（細絨）漲八四％其餘如牛皮，芝蔴，建木等類亦漲七七％五三％不等，而漲度不及五○者，尙有十種左右。</p>
<p>（二）工業品中生絲漲度亦特高，計漲一六一％，而顏料則漲八八％，五金類中鉛絲漲七○％，化學原料類中燒鹼漲微九七％，布疋類中細布漲五五％，此外漲度在四七％以下者有十一種。</p>
<p>（三）鑛產品以煤價漲度最高，比戰前漲一三八％至一一八％，柴油漲七一％，煤油漲六四％，錫漲六七％，銻漲六○％，餘如汽油，靑鉛，生鐵等亦漲三三％至一六％有差。</p>
<p>綜合這農工鑛重要商品上漲成分觀之，其間漲二○○％以上者為農產，漲一五○以上者，為農二，工一，漲一○○％以上者，農一，鑛二，漲五○％以上者，農七，工六，鑛五，餘則悉屬漲度在五○％以下者。在這些高漲物價中，雖有不少是外銷商品，掊子，桐油，絲，茶，牛皮，純銻等類，其價高漲，是利於輸出的，姑不具論。至若煤和生油，豆油，棉花，棉紗，布疋，芝蔴，豆類等等，則為人民衣食攸關之日用必需品，竟亦日趨高漲，尤其是最近生油和豆油的漲風驚人可怕，殊與人民生活上增加莫大痛苦，而此種物價高漲的生活負担，又加於今日流亡孤島，多數失業的上海市民，其影響於社會秩序安寗，有可斷言，是値得吾人深切注意的。</p>

<h3>歐洲小國對德的答案</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>有許多國家大事，在主持者自以爲聰明之極，足以掩盡天下人的耳目，而其結果呢，則司馬昭之心，路人皆知，在當時騰笑萬方，在將來貽譏無窮，實在可算得其愚不可及也！別的不必說：我對於德國向歐洲各小國提出問題，這一個舉動，也就免不了這樣的感想。</p>
<p>各小國的答案是一毫不足驚異的。因爲誠如華盛頓哈瓦斯社的電報所說：「各該小國所處環境，無殊於在强徒手槍威脅之下，迫令答覆是吾安全，蓋所可提出之覆文，自必言不由衷。」同時巴黎美聯社的電報也說：「彼等若對希特勒之提問，敢作何吾定答覆時，實不啻自尋煩惱。」可見歐洲的聰明人，不見得是希特勒一個，各小國政府的當局者，到底並非笨伯，還懂得不吃眼前虧，而自尋煩惱的道理。可是，他們給希特勒以滿意的答覆，還不是和沒有答覆一樣？</p>
<p>當然希特勒獲得了他們的答覆，因以答覆羅斯福，便可以振振有辭，以羅斯福為過慮，為無的放矢，而避免直接答覆羅斯福的詢問了。然而世人的觀察便又怎樣呢？果然會和他一般見識麼？</p>
<p>我們以爲羅斯福的熊度是極誠懇的，因爲他曾提議召開極有建設性的國際會議，公平地商訂世界大事，可見他並非要加壓力於希特勒。他的說話也是很坦率的，問德義兩國肯不肯保證在十年或二十五年之內，不侵略他國：肯不肯一言而決，本來也用不到迂迴曲折，先之以墨索里尼的似答覆非答覆，後之以希特勒的詢問各小國。現在他們，允其希特勒，這樣的閃爍其詞，竭力規避作正面的答覆，誰還相信他們有一分誠意呢？誰還相信他們的說話有一分價値呢？</p>
<p>希特勒這一詢問，以及將來對羅斯福的可能的答覆，也許自以為巧不可階，足以自圓其說，有助於他的政策的推行吧。但是我們可以說，經他這一間，各小國必然憬然醒悟，「在手槍威脅之下」，是只好給「强徒」予取予求的，加緊防備，聯合抵抗，自然會成爲他們迫切的要圖。而美國呢，當然，也就淸楚地看出這兩個法西斯國，一毫沒有悔禍之心，仍當進行其侵略，她，美國，自然會和民治陣綫，作更加密切的合作了。弄巧反拙，也許正是今日法西斯獨裁者的惟一手法，惟一下塲吧！</p>
<h3>笨（下）</h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>他們衝進祠堂裏去，沒有遇見一個敵人，等到要返身出來時，前後門却給敵人的火網堵住了。他們只好悶在裹面，反攻爲守。</p>
<p>隊長對大家說：『這定是誰走漏了風聲，他們預先走出去，反來包圍我們了。現在最要緊的，是去通知各路埋伏的人，速即前來攻他們的背後，然後冉由我們這裹攻出來，裏應外合，將他們解決。』於是又問着說：『那一位弟兄肯出去？』</p>
<p>外面的槍聲比裏面還要緊密，因爲外面多幾架機關槍，而在槍聲中還夾着小鋼砲的聲音。</p>
<p>『隊長，我去。』</p>
<p>隊長一聽，就知道是王本中。</p>
<p>『你不成功吧；你槍還不會放呢。』</p>
<p>『我可以用刀戳的。』還是那一句話，大家在百忙中不禁又笑了起來。</p>
<p>王本中吿了奮勇之後，也沒有別人出來爭着要出去，於是隊長就准許了他，可囑了他一些話，呌兩個弟兄帮他從中埭天井的圍墻上爬出去。他從別人的肩頭上爬上了圍墻，頭頂上子彈的嘯聲他似乎沒有聽見，悄悄地帶着刀，落了地，就向麥田裏匍匐行去。</p>
<p>祠堂後面有一條小河，河上，祠堂的西北角，有一條小木橋。他依着隊長的說話，不從橋上走，就從淺淺的河水中，涉了過去。一上岸，他就急急的奔着，向伏兵最多的一座石橋邊奔去，這裏離開那小木橋大概有二三里路吧。這是通城裏的大路，所以這裏伏兵最多。</p>
<p>他找到分隊長，報吿了隊長的命令。分隊長立刻一面再派三個人出去，分頭通知其他的伏兵，一同進攻，一面就領着所帶的人，急行跑步向祠堂攻來。</p>
<p>這時王本中沒有主意了，因爲隊長所交代他的，就是這些，關於他個人如何，隊長並沒有說明。常然，他應該跟着分隊長走，可是他們跑得那樣快，又在黑夜，一轉眼間，他已經落在他們的後面，只是一個人了。</p>
<p>遠遠的槍砲聲，鬧成一片。他握着刀，想了想，不知轉着什麼念頭，索性不跑了，再想了想，就返身回到石橋邊，坐了下來。</p>
<p>三四小時的戰鬥，東方在發白了。槍砲聲漸漸稀了下去，似乎戰鬥就要吿畢了。王本中還是茫然坐在那裏，沒有立起來過。</p>
<p>忽然，他看見前面有人在熹微的晨光中，急急奔來，他就翻身伏在地上，仔細看着。稍爲近些，他認出是兩個黃衣人。他奮興了，就將刀握得緊些，準備着。</p>
<p>在兩個黃衣人拖着槍走上橋的五六步石級時，王本中就輕輕地立起來，跟在他們的後面，等到够得到時，就舉起刀來向後面一個人的頸項削去。因爲用力很猛，後面這一個人就完全倒入了河中，不曉得他的身首有吾異處。前面的一個人一聽見聲音，回頭來望，王本中早已將刀抽了過來，向他的心腹間戳進去。他立不牢，就倒在橋面上，王本中不待他掙扎起來，又一脚，將他踢下了河中。</p>
<p>『他媽的，到底給我殺到了。』王本中走下橋到他原伏的地方時，這樣說。</p>
<p>接着，他又這樣殺了三個人，一决兩個，一决一個。</p>
<p>在天光大亮的時候，他看見了自己的大隊，也在向這條路上奔來，於是他就迎了出去。隊長一看見他，就問：</p>
<p>『沒有鬼子過去麼？』</p>
<p>『沒有，』王本中說，『一個也沒有。』</p>
<p>『那末奇怪了；後有人說，明明看見幾個鬼子打從這條路走的，現在躱到那裹去了呢？」</p>
<p>『隊長，他們都躱到河裏去了。』</p>
<p>『什麼？』</p>
<p>等到王本中解釋明白之後，沒有一個人不大笑的，一方面笑他說得那樣笨，——其實是巧吧，——一方面歡笑他的成功。</p>
<p>隊長知道這一路上，沒有敵人漏網，就下令大家休息一會。</p>
<p>『你怎麼會躱在此地的？』隊長又問。</p>
<p>『因爲隊長只呌我來送信，沒有呌我回去，所以就留在此地了。』又是一陣大笑。</p>
<p>『你的功勞不小；今天是你第一功。』</p>
<p>『隊長，』王本中似乎有些難爲情，囁嚅着語：『我實在是笨的，不會放槍打，只會用刀戳。不然，……」</p>
<p>以下的話，沒入笑聲中了</p>
<p>『你不笨，』隊長連忙說，『你不笨；確說你笨！』</p>
<p>從此，王本中叉有了一個別名，呌作王不笨。</p>

<h3>「神曲」漏下的故事</h3>
<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>但丁遊過地獄。</p>
<p>我在人間也見到了地獄的故事。</p>
<p>時問：個凄凉的午夜。午夜的氣象原是凄凉的，又加上幾點小雨，更顯得陰沉。</p>
<p>地點：冷靜的街道旁邊。洋槐葉子在抖，抖出索索瑟瑟的聲音，像鬼神嘆氣。</p>
<p>我在路旁跨着不快也不慢的步子。這時候，還算是冬天吧；冬天的雨點是最殘忍的東西，打在沒有戴帽的頭上，打亂了頭髮，又流到額角，成一條小瀑布，一直掛到眼邊。大衣的領子翻得很高，可是擋不住冬夜的尖風，和風里的雨水。冷，想抖，沒抖成。祇是，跨着不快也不慢，不大也不小的步子。</p>
<p>一拐灣，更陰沉了。路燈的微光，見了我害羞，躱在灰色的玻璃罩里露着一半亮。在燈前光里，看見雨點連成一條條細綫；銀色的，閃着，在風里斜下來。這是玻琍絲，不是雨，我想。</p>
<p>街頭沒有別人，只剩下我一個靈魂。</p>
<p>樹影，在昏淡的光下，灑了滿地。</p>
<p>天上沒有顏色，祇是黑，暗，滿眼空虛。</p>
<p>老遠里，來一聲狗吠，衝破暫時的沉寂，可是打不掉凄凉的空氣。冷，暗，淸靜的路上，只有孤獨的人影。誰會想到呢，世界上除了我之外，竟還有二十萬萬個人！</p>
<p>看，前面灰白高牆脚下，凹進的大門口，就閃着一個黑影。動了，閃過來了。是的，一個人。</p>
<p>平靜的空氣里，激動了。這平靜的境地，有了兩個活動的人，兩個靈魂。</p>
<p>迎着光望過去，那人影很淸楚的兀立在眼前。他面孔上，却剛好一片葉子遮着了光，沒讓我看見。只有，黑影上好像有一團黑髮，拖下幾根，披在額上。</p>
<p>一身凉，走吧。步子跨得大了些，快了些。</p>
<p>忽然，跫然的足音，跟着我來。是黑影的人物，喘急氣，跟着我來。不聽他一聲哀嘆，只有跫然的足音，掛在風雨的輕聲合奏中。</p>
<p>『還來！我失去的生命！』猛然拍我肩，一聲喊。</p>
<p>我一陣慌，只有笑。</p>
<p>『我失去的生命！』帶血的喉嚨，快迸出火星。</p>
<p>『醉漢！』</p>
<p>『不是醉！我祇要失去的生命！我的靈魂！我要你救我，救我！還我生命，靈魂。』</p>
<p>我一陣在笑。</p>
<p>手里忽然塞來一張白紙，捏得很皺了。趁着路燈的暗光，看。他却趁我看時，溜跑了，只臢了一聲跫然的足音。</p>
<p>頭探過去，壓在路燈的淡光下面。紙上，赫然：</p>
<p>『虹口通行證』五個大字。</p>
<p>原來……</p>
<p>街頭又祇剩我一個人，雨色的風，瘦的燈。</p>
<h3>我們應該怎樣</h3>
<p>— 洪中</p>
<p>自從上海成了孤島之後，我們的市民雖然在侵略者威脅之下，仍未忘記國家，忽視抗戰；例如救難的熱誠，節的獻金的踴躍，抗戰文化的展開等都可明確地證明。但有一部份人却把自己的思想行爲不自覺地流入了腐化。有些人還未有抗戰必勝的信心，聽到了一個城市陷落的消息就感到失望，聽到我軍勝利則又大喜。更有人對抗戰抱着「聽共自然」的態度，怎樣救國，毫不在意，只知暫時的個人的苟安，忘却了切身的危險。他們自私自利，苟且偷生，沒有集中的信仰，更不能有貫澈的有助於國家的行動。</p>
<p>國民精神總動員的意義非常深遠而重大，就是要把一切不合理的甚至有碍抗戰的思想習性與生活糾正過來。這可以說是千秋萬世的立國準繩，在我抗戰已進入反守為攻的第二階段的今天，允應爲我們全國所盡力奉行的。</p>
<p>我們這一决戰爭是民族革命的戰爭；它具有革命性與建設性的兩種重大意義，我們要使自己能和抗戰建國的國策相配合，必須要使我們的生活行動和精神事業都具有戰鬥性和建設性。</p>
<p>國民精神總動員綱領內所指示各點都應爲我們力行的。我們應以「國家至上，民族至上，軍事第一，勝利第二爲唯一目標。改正我們過去醉生夢死的生活，養成奮發蓬勃之朝氣，打破自私自利的企圖，糾正錯雜紛岐的思想，我們應在平日的生活中一一去實踐。</p>
<p>在最後勝利尙未實現之前，我們應時刻坦白地檢討自己；我們要在抗戰中洗滌凈盡過去的缺點；我們的國民精神要跟着戰時的進行而進步；我們要嚴肅緊張個人的生活，貫澈抗戰到底的主張；我們要把我們的言行能做到表裏一致，使我們一般社會的生活形態，能切實做到戰時生活的條件。</p>
<p>在奉行國民精神總動員的今日，我們在孤島上的每一個人最起碼要做到下面這樣：確立抗戰必勝建國必成的信念，不賣買劣貨，實行節的獻金，和展開防奸運動。</p>

<h3>大衆週刊另行出版</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>大衆週刊自民國二十七年十二月五日在本報出版以來，今天已出到第二十期了。</p>
<p>在這二十期裹面，如「民族英雄」，「石童子」，「袁崇煥」，「大衆唱詞」，「文天祥」，「花木蘭」，「大衆知識」，「讀報門檻」，「難民謠」，「生活常識」，「請勿隨地吐痰」等篇，均能引起讀者熱烈的同情，而每期難記者之作品及倡導大衆節的救難，增强大衆生產工作等，作品，收效允爲宏大，這是本刊可以吿慰的。</p>
<p>不過本刊篇幅有限，每期收到的稿件，都未能全部發表，常使作者諸君失望；同時本刊是申報的副刊，已另有計劃改出其他週刊了。故本刊今後擬另行出版，想爲讀者與作者諸君所歡迎的罷。</p>
<p>本刊旣是大衆的讀物，希望大衆仍本以往精神，擁護本刊，使本刊今後更加健全的發展起來，編者同仁，自當追隨大衆，共同努力，邁進！</p>
<p>最後我們對於申報此决與難民協會熱心合作，使本刋能受大衆的歡迎，應該表示深切的感謝！</p>

<p>一聲霹靂響靑天，年半光陰瞬息間。各省各城遭刦難，哀鴻遍地實堪憐。有的是全家骨肉分離散，有的是長期逃難乏金錢。以致於流離載道無歸宿，吿貸無門淚泗漣。腹中難吃飽，身上沒衣穿，街頭巷尾獨留連。眼看他鄉爲餓鬼，定將白骨壑中塡。此情此景何其慘，遭遇如斯難盡言。幸有許多慈善者，當仁不讓動矜憐。組織難民救濟會，不辭勞瘁不辭艱。各業委員來敦請，各方勸募難民捐。聚沙成塔從來說，集腋成裘自古言。有的是自動會中來認款，有的是壽儀移助省開筵。有的是積自日常浪用費，有的是戒飲酒還戒吸烟，有的孩童志氣好，積省每天糖果錢。眞的是救人一命陰功積，勝造浮屠到塔尖。到如今難民得有安身處，都是那諸君造福永無邊，當然戶誦與家弦</p>
<h3>孤島上公共衛生重要</h3>
<p>— 育才</p>
<p>公共衛生是許多人的衛生問題，實在比個人衛生進一步的重要，因爲個人的不衛生爲害不過是個人。公共地方的不衛生，爲害便不僅是個人而是許多人了。所以我們居住在公共地方，除須注意個人衛生外，每一個人都須注意到公共衛生，這是我們的責任。允其是在這通商大埠五百萬市民麕集的孤島上，公共衛生問題實在比吃飯問題更重要，現在舉幾件日常最普通的事，盼望全市同胞們大家注意。這是舉一反三的意思，全在我們各個人互相勉勵隨時隨地注意才是。</p>
<p>不隨地吐痰　吐痰是我國同胞的惡習，傳染成肺病，害處很大。在三月二十六日已由女靑年會及其他衛生團體舉行過「反吐痰運動」得到的效果，還未見十分圓滿，因爲這是國人的積習，要立刻統統改變過來，當然是件難事，根本辦法，還在鍜鍊身體，使身體健康，肺部强壯，自然痰液亦就减少了。</p>
<p>不隨地便溺　隨地便溺，實在是一件不雅觀的事，到了熱天，各路里街，臭氣冲天，何等不衛生。所以我們在公共地方便溺，一定要進厠所。一面希望當局再設法增加公厠所，這亦是積極的辦法。</p>
<p>不隨地拋果屑　隨地拋棄果殼紙屑，一則有碍市容，二則又不衛生，例如香蕉皮瓜皮之類，最易人使滑倒，又很容易吸引蚊黽，傳染疾病。</p>
<p>人類原是過的互助生活生活，無論是甚麼利害，都是互有關係的，人家有利，我亦有利，人家有害，我亦有害。所以凡是對於人家有益的事，應該像自己有利益的事一樣的竭力，這不但是衛生，而且是公益。</p>

<h3>讀報門檻（二續）</h3>
<p>— 譚天</p>
<p>新聞記者　新聞記者直接是報　消息的供給者，間接又是社會民衆知識的播音機。可是現在的新聞記者大多因爲生活的關係，偶然爲金錢所迷，受賄於私人出賣了自己的使命，所以新聞的記述常有偏向，總不能完全客觀的記載下來，即有比較客觀的新聞，亦難免不有偏向之處。這只有靠讀者的知力來識破了。還有一種呌做訪員的，和新聞記者的職務差不多，不過是多於採訪報館所在地的新聞爲多罷了。</p>
<p>通信社　通信社的名目，我們在報紙的新聞上處處可以遇到，通常在每件新聞之上，必有某某社的字樣，這就是某社所發出的稿子。通信社的名目很多，有路透社哈瓦斯社有塔斯社有美聯社有海通社及同盟社這些通訊社組織周密，除發出國內國外的新聞外，還直接供共政府的情報。所以他們都是代表政府的組織，所發新聞的口吻，自也是代表其政府利益爲宗旨。我國新聞事業落後，通信社的組織允共稀少，不但國際新聞須由上面的各大通訊社供給，連國內的新聞也常由共代發，比如報上會有「中央社某地某日路透電」字樣，此即表明路透社的國際新聞譯成中文後，交給中央社代發的，這樣一來新聞的供給，自然是疏暢但藉端歪曲，或淆惑聽聞的事實。勢必難免，這是不合算的。至於各個通信社的立塲以及其宜傳之目的所在。各個不同，一件新聞，牠們有幾種說明。不懂得究竟的讀者，一定是莫明其妙，關於這一點，以後當有詳細的說明。</p>
<p>特派員　特派員是帶着某種任務由報館派出的記者，像派遺在外國各重要地方，記者祖任蒐集新聞的記者，或以報吿國際會議，及其他內外主要事件爲任務而派遺的記者，都是特派員。像報紙上的海外通訊，就是這些特派員所發的文稿，此外報紙上也常有所謂本報專電者，這是指報館的特的通訊員發出的電報而言的，和特派員的職務，並不相同。</p>
<p>通電　當國家發生重大事故的時候，報紙上常常有通電的新聞出現，發通電的人不是團體便是要人，牠的義意正與時局攸關，故非常重要。說到報紙上的新聞，大家都知道，是有很多名目的，有國際新聞，有國內新聞，有社會新聞，有地方新聞，更有經濟新聞，文化新聞等等名目，這些新聞，在報紙上各據一方，只要讀者要看何種新聞，即可隨手翻得。不過每項新聞當中自有些難於了解之處，若不予以說明，則難完全了解。</p>
<p>國際新聞　把外國的消息登載到自己國家的報紙上，這就呌做國際新聞，比方說現在報上常登載捷克淪亡的事件，西班牙和平談判事，蘇日漁業糾紛事件這都是眼前的國際新聞。現在的世界民主國家與法西國家是站在兩個不同的利害的觀點上，而社會主義國家更與法西國有絕對不能調和現象。捷克的淪亡，西國的內戰，即是法西國家侵略的步驟。（日本之所以進兵中國的也是如此，）而蘇日漁業糾紛即是社會主義國家與法西主義國家對立之一種。這樣的說法不過是依照現在的糾紛的說法，但實際上說來，現在的世界只有兩個對立的形勢（一）是社會主義社會（一）是資本主義社會法西斯主義，不過是資本主義進攻社會主義的先鋒而已。牠們本來是一致的。照現在情形看來，法西國家，固不僅要向社會主義國家進攻，而同時還要對各大國作重分土地的步驟，所以形成侵略陣綫與民主陣錢的矛盾。關於這一點非幾句話說得完，將來我們再作詳談。總之現在的世界不論社會主義也好，資本主義也好，牠們的紛爭皆能左右我們的國家，左右我們的生活，我們要研究國際新聞，要從複雜的國際問題當找出我們求生的道路。所以國際新聞是非常重要的。</p>
<p>國內新聞　自己國家裏，不管是那一省，或那一個地方，只要發生了什麼事情也與我們利害有關，報紙上登載各地的消息的，這就呌做國內新聞，像現在南昌的戰事，杭州的戰事，以及各地的中日兩軍戰事情况等，無論其地方遠近，皆都是眼前中國內地發生的事件的動態，所以都是國際新聞，有些報紙在新聞末了登「長篇通訊」把刋出的新聞再詳細的叙述一番，供讀者參觀</p>
<p>社會新聞　社會新聞欄內所登載的都是和現社會有關係的文字，像二房東與大房東的房子糾紛，火燒失愼，綁票勒贖，財產分爭，姦淫虐待自殺烟賭等，皆是此種新聞，文字通俗，且所叙述之事，皆與現社會有關，故一般初學讀報者皆喜閱讀，可是我們要明白跟着這社會不景氣，有些報紙對於社會新聞特別多登些迎合低級趣味的東西，妖邪鬼怪呀，妓女的軼事呀，捉姦見官呀，……這些新聞，有人稱牠爲軟性新聞。只能讓有閒階級的大老爺去尋開心，對於一般勞働的人是毫無益處的，所以我們以後遇着這種新聞不看牠爲妙。我們要看的還是含有暴露與改造性的社會新聞，比較有些意義，因爲從這裏面，我們不僅可以得事實的啟　，還可以認識眞理與事實的根源。</p>
<p>地方新聞　報紙上的有本埠新聞的名目，當然也要有地方新聞的名目，但地方新聞道名目，有些報紙與國內新聞分不開，更有的報紙與社會新聞分不開，有些報紙不呌地方新聞，而呌「各縣消息」「各地通訊」各報編法不同，所以各目也有特異，依我們看來名雖有不同，而地方新聞仍是重要的，因爲牠能反映谷地的情况。</p>
<p>經濟新聞　隨便什麼報紙上，經濟新聞都劃出一個專欄登載，不過此種經濟新聞都是登些米麥絲茶桐油白糖之類的市况，以及滙劉貼水債券標金等情形，至於吸收法幣，穩定法幣等新聞，則又另予登載，此種現象一般的說來，是不合理的，所以現在經濟新聞是與商業新聞分不開的，這要向讀者來一下。此外在經濟新聞當中專門的名詞很多，外行人很難看懂。這兒我們不妨稍爲提出來說一說，比方我們折借一百塊洋錢，每天應交納的利息，這就呌「洋折」；隔一天交現的票據，呌作「滙頭」；當天交現的票據，呌作「劃頭」；拿大洋去兌換小洋拆，呌做「拆兌」，交易塲裹做期貨的，先買後賣，呌做「買空」或是「多頭」，先賣後買的呌作「賣空。」或是「空頭」。這一欄計有（一）金融行市，內分國內滙兌，國外匯兌，金市銀市證券市等。（二）商品行市，內分米市麵粉市雜糧油餅市絲茶市棉花市，紗布市，此外還有標金價格，是按國幣計算的，價格的漲落，要看銀價的變化，要是銀價漲高，金價就低落，銀價低落，金價就漲高，至於證券是含有公債和股票兩種的，要是時局有謠言，或是起了什麼變化，價格就會跌落，這種新聞經常的讀者都是做買賣的人，可是一般人也應該隨時注意，因爲錢價的高漲跌落，一定影響到日常的物價的變動，所以不僅和我們日常生活有關係，和國家的經濟生命也有關係，巡是大家必須要認淸的。</p>

<p>— 難記者</p>
<p>爲何要救濟難民，已經說過了；怎樣去救濟難民，巴經說過了；做難民的應該怎樣，也已經說過了。</p>
<p>總而言之，一切的行動，都該是積極性的！</p>
<p>所謂積極性的，是與消極性的做好事不同。消極性的做好事，完全是一種義務：積極性，却變成責任了。</p>
<p>救難民，有把難民救成「非難民」的責任；做難民，有把自已造成「非難民」的責任。</p>
<p>各盡其責，於是難民問題就完全解決了！</p>
<h3>一週戰事</h3>
<p>— 吳光</p>
<p>華軍在本週戰事，極爲得手，土地克復之多，各綫勝利消息之傅播，迭有所聞。允以廣東湖北方面，奏捷膚功，各方皆爲之振奮。現在各綫局勢，正在繼續展開，日方數月來所努力之成果，已蕩然無餘，新勝利之希望，已有實際之表現也。茲將各錢情况，略列於下：</p>
<p>廣東</p>
<p>廣東華軍，勇猛異常，本周內與日軍遭遇者，隨處皆是，而進展之迅速，允爲特徵。東江方面，經分路向增城圍擊，先佔增城四週之各要點後，乃向增城直衝而入，與日軍於城內巷戰，激烈拼殺之結果，乃將該城完全克復，北江華軍，克花縣後，更連合各軍有力部隊，順勢向廣州推進。據報戰，已距廣州僅十二哩，廣州城內，可聞砲聲，其進展之順利，極可注意。西江華軍，已迫近三水。佛山刻在圍攻中。總之，此方面之戰局，巳完成包圍廣州之形勞，困處廣州之日軍，非常恐慌。</p>
<p>河南</p>
<p>豫東華軍，日前曾一鼓而衝入開封，與日軍周旋數日，遂將中原重要根據地，予以佔領。本週來，更挾共餘威，繼續向南關進迫，日軍不得已，由隴海路調來援軍二千餘名，前來應戰。但此項援軍，在張莊下車，正遇華軍邀擊，肉排爭奪，戰况至爲慘烈，日軍頗有傷亡。同時另一部華軍，復乘機攻克通許縣城，分兵切斷隴海路，使其首尾不接，豫南國攻信陽之華軍，正在合圍力攻；困守城內之日軍，雖頑强抗拒，但勢難得逞。</p>
<p>湖北</p>
<p>鄂北日軍，週內爲保衛應山，安陸，兩據點，曾向迫近縣城之華軍，作數路迂迴之反攻；經華軍分頭堵擊，激戰數日，日方雖大放毒氣，亦不能前進。十七日晨，忽全綫潰退，經奮力窮追，現在兩縣城，已在華軍圍攻中，鄂中鍾祥四週，經華軍先後收復，本週城內日軍，曾數度出城反攻，均經擊退。至於岳口以西，岡向黑流渡進犯以赴援鍾祥之日軍，十七日拂曉，華軍突起攻擊，血戰兩晝夜，十八日晚，日軍已被解決。</p>
<p>山西</p>
<p>晋南華軍，出擊部隊，速日大舉掃蕩夏縣聞喜各縣城之日軍，日軍大爲受挫，曾由安運增援夏縣，經分路夾擊，殘餘日軍，乃退回原路。晋柬冀城之日二千餘，軍突向華軍進攻，華軍用機運戰術，將日軍切成數段，各別擊破，日軍紛向城內而去。華軍乘勝逍擊，縣城乃乖手而得，晋西離石，中陽一帶，華軍一週來，奮力出擊，頗奏膚功，日軍度河西犯企圖，大爲受挫。</p>

<h3>戰前之上海市建設（二）</h3>
<p>— 琳琅</p>
<p>（二）圖書館及博物館。此二者爲都市居民精神上之食糧，亦即文化建設之始階，上海市政府特於府南右路，及府南左路，建築圖書館及博物館各一所。全部房屋，均極宏大，興工於二十三年十月，落成於二十五年一月。圖書館與博物館之地位，計各爲縱三百五十呎，橫五百五十呎。四週有修潔整齊之道路。屋係兩層，中央突高，作北平之城樓式。內部設計，均視用途而各異。光綫有天然的與人爲的，均極充足。兩館屋宇，外觀咸其樸實簡單，但殊莊嚴。以中國向來之作風，與實際上需要者相調和，別創一格。墻之外表，砌以人造花崗岩，望之頗爲堅緻。博物館之樓層，槪無窗孔，有之惟底層之各室而已。陳列窒中完全利用自然光綫，其原理，在令參觀者不見光綫之來路，墻壁七所受之光綫，更甚於地板。凡壁上懸畫之處，其光綫咸來自側頂，故參觀者所立之處，未必十分光明，而墻上之嘗畫則纖微畢露矣。基層裝有空氣調節機，冬暖夏凉，常保室內空氣之適當溫度，及其新鮮之成份。是以上層雖不設窗，而參觀者並無不舒適之感覺也。圖書館中有大閱讀室兩間，其面積爲三十二呎乘八十六呎，地板上鋪以軟木，人行其上可保靜寂，不致擾及他人。藏書室設於屋之後部，以防火門與其他部份隔絕。其內可藏書五十萬册，地板以磚塊玻璃砌就，架於鋼架之上，光綫極佳。前年夏，市府舉行十週紀念會時，共文藝展覽及市政展覽，即分別在博物館及開書館舉行者也。（三）醫院及衛生試驗所。市中心區華原路，建築有大規模之醫院及衛生試騐所，佔地約八十餘畝。工程開始於二十三年十二月，至二十五年五月完成。市醫院建築中初步完成之屋宇，計長二百七十七呎，闊五十三呎，約有面積一萬二千方呎。全屋四層，中部特高兩層爲六層，全部容積約五十五萬五千立方呎，全部面積約四萬九千方呎。平時能設病榻一百五十隻，緊要時可再增加五十隻。屋之底層裝置鍋爐，及電氣機械等設備；第一層爲辦事處，X光室及特診室，門診室，會客室，問訊處，藥劑室，檢驗室，及急診室等；第二層爲外科部及男子手術室；第三層爲產婦科部及兒童病室；第四層爲醫務人員室及廚房等。醫院內一切設備，均頗完美。衛生試騐所在醫院之東，佔地約十五畝。屋高三層，面積爲一百三十四呎乘四十九呎，約有容積二十二萬方呎。第一層爲問訊處，會客室，醫生間，主任室，圖書室，辦公室，材料室及消毒室等；第二層爲各種苗漿培養室；第三層爲化學室，硏究室，陳列室及演講廳等。爲便利應用起見，室內有煤氣，眞空，壓縮空氣，高週波，直流及交流電，高壓汽體，及電氣冷藏等各種設備。</p>
<p>市立公園　市中心區之有公園，以「上海市第一公園」始。該園於二十一年一月開工，中間因「一二八」事變，停頓約五閱月。至二十二年年底，大致工程已粗其規模。其後又續行增飾，楚緻可觀。園址在市中心區域行政區之西，國和路，國濟北路，政同路與政通路之間，面積約三百四十畝。全園可大別爲五區：曰大門區，在園之西南角，爲全園出入之總樞，設景宏偉，並備浪木沙池等，供兒童遊戲之用。曰花搜區，在園之西部。中部爲森林區，面積最廣。東部爲運動塲，設球塲及周圍長四百尺之跑道，塲內並足容觀衆七八千人。東南部爲池島區，池通虬江，可迥舟盪漿，垂釣採蓮，全園風景中最擅勝塲之區也。建築之初步工程，以運動塲土方工程爲最鉅，共分三期進行，計共費二萬三千五百餘工，運土一萬餘立方工尺。塲地佈置草皮，四週遍植花樹，俾與公園景色相吻合。園藝方面，種植樹木樹苗三萬餘株，花卉花苗六萬餘本，鋪設草地數萬平方公尺。工程方面，除木橋石橋四座外，尙有石洞一處，石堆假山一及土堆假山各一座。</p>
<p>水電交通　（一）自來水。市中心區域之自來水，由閘北水電公司供給之。全區水管網佈置，按照公用局所定計劃，計有六百公厘口徑水管五千四百公尺，一百公厘口徑水管二萬七千八百六十公尺。第一期水管網已完成一部，約長二十五公里。其餘尙未埋設者，隨時可報請接水，凡由市政府保證水公司費收入之用戶，可無須貼給水公司延長水管之費用。故市民之在市中心區建屋者，接用自來水，實較上海市內其他各區爲有利。（二）給電及路燈。市中心區用電，本係由軍工路六千六百伏之綫路供給。該處路綫北接閘北水電公司剪淞橋發電廠，南接該公司接受上海電力公司電力之平凉路受電所，故市中心區用電，兩端均可供給，絕無長時間停電之虞。至二十六年夏止，第一期給電計劃內之　壓路綫，已敷　八公里，低壓路綫已敷設十三公里。凡路綫所及之處，路燈均已裝妥。夜間全部放光，行路毫無不便。（三）電話。市中心區之電話交通，其初本由上海電話局閘北分局接至江灣分局，再由江灣分局沿體育會路，翔殷路，淞滬路，三民路架設五十對電纜一路，以達市中心區。其中二十五對接至市政府之交換機，以供市政府對外中繼綫之用；其餘二十五對，備裝接市中心區內其他用戶之用，其接至市政府之中繼綫，直達閘北分局，其餘則須由江　分局之交換機而達閘北分局，以上均爲初期設備。至二十六年，上海電話局早經在市區內設立分局，裝置自動機四百號，與閘北分局之自動機聯絡，成一整偭電話通訊網。（四）公共汽車。市中心區之主要交通工具爲公共汽車，係由華商公共汽車公司承辦。二十三年春初次開駛，至二十六年，其行駛路綫有四，五，六等號，往來自中心區與北站，及黎平路與閘北水電廠之間，閘北京滬車站至市中心區之路綫爲第四路，計長約十公里半。該路全綫行車時間約須三十分鐘，除去各站停車時刻約七分鐘，其行車速率平均爲每小時二十七公里。以十二輛往返開駛，計每隔五分鐘即有一班。至短程交運工具則有人力車等，設備亦良好。</p>
<p>虬江碼頭　上海浦江兩岸，設立碼頭及倉庫，作爲泊船及堆貨之用者，於茲已數十年。但以黃浦江狹水淺，雖歷經開濬，而吃水甚深之巨舶，仍難直駛停泊；且起卸貨物，亦殊困難。自上海市政府成立繁榮大上海計劃以來，即着目於開港及設立碼頭。誠以發展國內工商業，及開拓國際貿易，均非繫於交通不可；而碼頭之設，又為一般工商業所託命。故大上海計劃成立之日，虬江碼頭建設之基礎亦即樹立。時爲民國二十三年，中央銀行決定投資，興建虬江碼頭倉庫。九月四日，成立虬江碼頭設計委員會。翌年八月，以設計工作完竣，遵命將設計委員會，改組爲建設委員會，開始建築工程。二十五年六月廿日行奠基禮。全部工程分為三期進行，第一期工程於二十六年夏完竣，六月十二日正式開業，於是此睥睨遠東之虬江碼頭，即與世人相見。首次傍靠此碼頭者，爲國營招商局之「公平」輪，其後行駛遠東綫外輪中之「日本皇后」號巨輪，亦於十三日作處女之停泊。孰知「八一三」戰事起後，國人矚望方殷之「虬江碼頭」，乃時時出現於戰訊之中，轟炸毀損，創痍滿目，大好工程之所在，成爲抗戰喋血之塲合，悲哉！茲將虬江碼頭之建築經過，及倉庫槪要等，誌之如次：（一）地位與工和。虬江碼頭位於黃浦西岸，上字　九十號，虬江口以北，圈定灘地約八百餘畝，及周一·三·兩圖內土地約三百餘畝。經先後購買，並塡高至吳淞口水準零點以上十九呎半後，有岸綫長約三千餘呎，闊約一千餘呎，均可作建築碼頭堆棧等用。全部工程進行，共分三期。第一期先行建築碼頭兩座；兩層鋼骨水泥堆棧兩幢：及鐵棚平棧兩幢。建築工程費約共五百萬元。二十六年夏所完成者，即此第一期之工程也。碼頭兩座，每座各長五百九十呎，行駛遠東綫之最大巨舶，昌興公司之「日本皇后」號，即停靠於此碼頭者，故任何大郵船，均得停靠。兩層之鋼骨水泥堆棧，需要時，可以隨時增至四層；鐵棚平棧可以拆除，即以其地建築鋼骨堆　。以上碼頭與堆棧之地點，均在碼頭區域之南段，約佔全面積三分之一。按照原定計劃，如全部完成則有直綫形碼頭　綫長約三千呎，四層鋼骨堆棧八幢，鐵棚平棧三幢；南端另築駁船港口。離堆棧後約千呎處，卽係市區道路網幹道之浦西路，南北通達；自市中心區至碼頭中段邊緣，五權路橫貫其間。碼頭區域北部，又有公共碼頭一座，長約三百五十呎。各堆棧前碼頭甲板上，均裝有運輸貨物之機械設備，如起重機，輕便鐵道等。碼頭區域內部，沿浦西路兩旁，留有餘地，以供建設碼頭有關之旅行社，輪船公司，轉運公司，汽車公司。及旅館等代辦處之用。（二）水陸空聯運。上海爲長江各省進出口貨物分配之總樞紐，故虬江碼頭計劃於堆棧前後，敷設鐵道，接通淞滬綫，是則與自海通車之各路，如京浙平津粵漢，均可聯運。凡自外洋運　之貨物，可於船到時，即刻卸下裝車，運往內地；而內地出口，亦可由火車裝至虬江碼頭，卸於船上，直運外洋。無論進出口貨物，均無須落棧，不僅省時，抑且省費。此項鐵道，長約九公里，其建築費，據兩路管路局估算，約須國幣七十五萬元。碼頭附近空地，面積有數千畝，在大上海計劃中，擬闢為飛機塲，同時並於江面規定一處，為水上飛機停泊之所。以備他日碼頭貨物之運輸，不僅水陸聯運，更進而收水陸空三者聯運之效也。（三）碼頭。第一期工程中完成之碼頭，計分兩座，每座長五百九十呎，已如前述。碼頭甲板闊五十呎，置有一切停泊設備，下有距離五十呎闊之停泊樁，並有橫木樁，以供駁船之停泊。甲板上有旋轉起重機等，下面另造低層甲板，以便潮水低落時，小船及駁船，仍得照常工作。上海碼頭之足供三十呎吃水船舶停靠者，不過長六千英尺，而巨型輪船吃水之深，當達三十三英尺。虹江碼頭位於虬江口，岸綫平直，浦面最闊，水量最深，任何巨輪進出——即世界上最巨大之「曼麗后號——不須等待潮水，並可免除各種危險，安然停舶。（四）堆棧。第一期工程中完成之堆棧，每幢長二百二十呎，寬一百三十呎，上層爲貨物長期寄存處，下層則爲貨物短期寄存之用。鐵棚平棧係臨時性之建築，爲貨物短期寄存之所。每幢長二百二十呎，闊八十呎，有橋樑三架，直通碼頭甲板。全部堆棧之容積，約爲一萬五千噸，堆棧外碼頭甲板上，置有軌起重機，可將貨物由船艙中，直接吊至堆棧之任何一層，無須經人工搬運。堆棧前檢驗貨物處，有複式直綫起重機，可將堆棧下層之貨物，直接吊至上層。堆棧內後部裝有電梯。故堆棧內部可以維持單程交通。（五）交通。市中心區公共道路之系統中，規定有兩大路綫，一係南北綫形，爲浦西路，自楊樹浦起，沿黃浦西岸，經碼頭後部約離一千呎處，即在碼頭綫與軍工路中間南北平行，至吳淞止。一係東西綫形，爲五權路，自第一碼頭使用地之北端邊岸起，橫貫軍工路，直達市中心區。此路之建築，係由中央銀行與上海市府合作，經費十五萬元。碼頭開始營業時，交通路綫有三：一、自五權路折入軍工路，以達楊樹浦路；二、自五權路經市中心區轉入其美路，以達公共租界其美路；三、自五權路經市中心區轉人江　路，以達北四川路。以上三路綫，汽東行駛均不過二十分錡而已。（六）其他建築。第一期工程中完成之建築，除碼頭及堆棧外，尙有辦公室，位於堆棧中問；職員住宅宿舍，可容四十人；堆貨曠塲，面積約二十五萬七千四百平方呎。</p>
<p>（乙）其他建設</p>
<p>上海市之建設，本分兩部份進行：一爲市中心區之新建設；一係就南市閘北等區原有之建設，加以整理或擴充。甲項所述者均爲新的建設，規模宏大，計劃精詳，爲大上海之主要建設，亦即新市區之發軔。茲更將舊有市區之整理及擴充工作，就十七年至二十六年之十年以來，作一槪括之紀述。論其建設之性質，本可分爲工務與公用兩項，但爲簡明計，祇逐項分述，不再另爲歸類。所有市中心之各項建設，亦不贅。</p>
<p>全市分區　上海市政府爲謀市政健全發展起見，經酌勘各種需要，考察實地情形，將上海市劃分爲下列各區域：（一）行政區。市中心區之中央部份。（二）工業區。吳淞浜蘊藻浜兩岸，南市國貨路以南，閘北沿柳營河橫浜河一帶，浦東自慶寗寺起向南至楊思港沿浜一帶。（二）住宅·商業區。滬南區域城廟以內，滬西愚園路南，虬橋路北，海格路西，凱旋路東之間。（四）油池區。高橋沙。（五）木業區域。北票煤礦公司南首起，至江山路止沿浦一帶。</p>
<p>道路溝渠　（一）滬南區　滬南原有街道，多係彈街路面，市工務局於十年以來，巳將主要各路，次第開闢整理。如東門路和平路，及裏馬路自東門路至大碼頭街一段，均排設溝管，鋪築柏油路面。此外之排有溝渠者，有陸家洪路，斜土路，製造局路，打浦路，魯班路等處。（二）閘北區。閘北區道路亦與南市同，多爲彈街路面。改築柏油路面及排設水管者，先後有大統路，共和路，恒豐路及寳山路南段。「一二八」之役，閘北區建設，毀壞殆盡。市工務局乃照規定計劃，將各路綫澈底整理，並將寳山路北段，及虬江路，寳興路，寳昌路，鴻興路，寳源路等，改築柏油路面。水電路改築澆柏油路面。江灣吳淞兩處街道，亦經統予整理。（三）浦東區。闢築浦東大道，並整理春山街等。綜計十年來，共築柏油路八四，一七一公尺；小方石路三，九一五公尺；砂石路五，〇九八公尺；彈街路二一三，一二五公尺；煤屑路二二二，〇七一公尺。共排大小溝管一八九，五〇八公尺。</p>
<p>橋梁碼頭　（一）橋梁。上海市區內河道，最大者爲黃浦江，次爲吳淞江蘊藻浜。市府爲發展兩岸交通計，十年來共建築橋梁二百五十八座，支出工費九十三萬八千餘元。較大者爲跨越吳淞江之恒豐橋，烏鎭橋，曹家渡橋，中山路三號橋，及跨越蘊藻浜之蘊藻浜橋。（二）碼頭駁岸。黃浦與吳淞江碼頭駁岸之修建，亦爲重要工程之一。十年來共建碼頭九十四座，造價三十二萬餘元。新建駁岸三千七百七十一公尺，造價共二十七萬九千餘元。</p>
<p>市有建築　（一）關於行政官署方面者，有市中心區之市政府及各局所辦公房屋。（參閱甲項「市中心區之建設」）（二）關於文化敎育事業者，有運動塲，體育館，游泳池，圖書館，博物館，動物園，植物園，及各學校新建之校舍等。（三）關於公共衛生及公衆設備方而者，有市立醫院，市立滬南醫院，衛生試騐所，滬北區衛生事務所，市立傳染病醫院，市立第一公墓，各處菜塲，吳淞公園，第一公園，文廟公園等。（四）關於平民福利事業者，有全家庵路，斜土路，交通路等平民住所三處，及中山路，其美路，普善路，太平橋路等平民村四所，共計房屋一千八百四十八閒。十年來新建市有建築，共計造價四百九十九萬九千一百四十八元六角八分。</p>

<h3>鼓勵「結婚與生育」</h3>
<p>— 流風</p>
<p>侵略者（不管是德日意）非但缺乏原料，並且，也缺乏人口。雖然他們口口聲聲說：「我們的人口太多啦！自己小小的國家內又容不下那麼多的人口，沒法，只得向外拓殖啦」！其實，這種話只是作爲向人侵奪土地的一種漂亮的藉口而已！要是誰相信了這話，那眞是天下第一個大蠢才了。</p>
<p>我說侵略者也缺乏人口，因爲侵略者總是鼓勵着他們的人民「結婚」與「生育」的。在德國，一個結了婚的男子，據說找起職業來就非常便當了。在意國，一胎生兩個孩子，就有獎賞；至於一胎生三個或者四個五個，那末，依我想來，當然首相又要向羣衆發表一次驚人的演說，至於「特別獎賞」，那是更不用說的了。</p>
<p>現在，聽說日本「厚生省」的所謂「生活科」主任高島向人宣稱：渠之目標，爲「日本每戶須有六孩」。復稱：「鼓勵生育與國家統制人口之機關，不久將設立，爲在此危急期間之國家福利計而提議之無數『銃後計劃』中，以增加日本人口一事爲最重要」。因此，有「提議日本應隨德意先例，由國家發給津貼，以鼓勵結婚與生育」了。</p>
<p>這三個侵略國家非但在「思想」上已經統一，並且企圖在「結婚」與「生育」上，也有加以「統一」的必要的表徵。不過，說來我很替我們的「友邦」悲哀的，那就是被驅到「大陸」來從事「英雄事業」的無數「結婚與生育」者之一方的男子，不是數目也太大了麼？這些「勇士們，非但浪費了他們的子彈，並且一看到我們中國的「花姑娘」，也大大的浪費了他們的「精神」，不過活着的總是好的，然而一變成「骨灰」，那末「結婚與生育」又何從而談起呢？這點，就是「厚生省」也是非常祖憂的，認爲「出生率低落之顯見原因，厥爲日本自一九三七年戰爭爆發以還，已喪失戰死者五十萬人」。雖然這「數字」出自「厚生省」是不大十分可靠的，然而「五十萬」究竟不是一筆很小的「數目」，如果這「五十萬」壯丁，能够如兵工廠一樣的來「加緊生產」一下，其「成績」是一定大有可觀的吧？</p>
<p>其次，希望「每戶須有六孩」爲「生活科」的主任高島先生的「目標」，這也是比較的困難的，依照目下日本國內生活程度的日益高漲，一輩薪給階級和勞働階級的人，其「實質工資」早已是比「事變」前跌落到不知多少倍了，雖然國家經濟也非常拮据，而提出一部作爲鼓勵「結婚與生育」者的「津貼」，然而「六個孩子」的負担，不能不說是個「大問題」，况且據現在的日本，「嬰孩」也得負担國債數十元，那末，誰的父母高與「生育」子女來加重自己的負担而又加重他們的子女的負担呢？</p>
<p>至於所謂「花嫁學校」（花嫁卽新娘的意思），無論上的什麼「速成班」的課，但是孩子還是要十月滿足出娘胎來的，「十月」是多麼長的「時間」呀！又何况把孩子養大到十六七歲成爲「少年兵」，那是更加長久的時間了！</p>
<p>「日本應隨德意先例，由國家發給津貼，以鼓勵結婚與生育」，無奈這是要十六七年後才能發生「作用」，這將怎樣好呢？</p>
<h3>趙侗將軍素描</h3>
<p>— 周一志</p>
<p>年靑的趙侗將軍，他放棄了士木工程，帶領游擊隊，抵抗日軍。因此他的敵人懸賞十萬元買他的頭顱，但他依舊帶着它在危險中往來着。</p>
<p>像影子一般的不可捉摸，活躍於北平城郊，曾不斷地使日軍感到頭痛的，中國游擊隊的靑年領袖趙侗將軍，很巧妙而又敏捷地避掉敵人的搜捕，離開華北。在去年年底，這位勇敢的靑年已出現於重慶！中國戰時首都。謁見蔣委員長以及其他軍政領袖，報吿游擊的活動，並請示一切。</p>
<p>趙將軍今年還祗不過是二十七歲，並不十分高的個子，適中的身材，看去是一個非常和氣而又勤學的大學生。今日他是活躍於平西西山一帶的萬數健兒之領袖。中國人很愛戴他，很崇拜他；相反地，他的敵人是非常害怕他。</p>
<p>去年十月某一個淸晨，他別了弟兄們從北平到重慶去。他扮裝一個賣捲心菜的小販，在日本憲兵的嚴密監視下，穿過城門進城去。那些憲兵把他搜查一番，就放他過去了。假使那些憲兵發現他就是趙侗的時候，他們準會大大的祝賀一番，因爲他的頭顱値十萬元呢！</p>
<p>趙將軍的弟兄們時常乘了中國人駕駛的日軍軍用車，混進城去。至於他自己，稍有不同。因爲日本的密探滿佈全城，密切地注意着這位重要的人物。有一次，趙將軍曾經往城內協和醫院治療他的鼻子。在那里安適的牀上，隱姓埋名地睡了好幾個月。後來又在那里休養了二個星期。每天，一個嫵媚的看護小姐來到病牀邊吿訴他，關於西山游擊隊的活動消息。可是她不知道，他乃是他們的眞正領袖。</p>
<p>當他第四次出院時，身上穿了一件發光的綢抱，仔細看起來，他好像一個做戲的伶工。憑藉了巧妙的化裝，他很安全的到了天津。在那里，他乘了輪船到上海。不久他安抵香港。當他抵達香港的時候，接到他的代理人從北平來的報吿，據說，在他離平不久，日軍接得關於他在北平城內的諜報，於是搜查全城，在二三天內，逮捕了許多中國靑年去審問，想從這許多靑年中我到他。</p>
<p>講到他的頭顱之價値，在一九三三年僅値三千元。當時他同幾個同志在東三省首次組織「東北靑年鐵血軍」。他以前是東北大學的二年級生，硏究土木工程，準備於畢業之後，從事於土木工程事業。現在他的代理人潘君惜（譯音）依舊帶領舊部之衆五千人左右，在遼東半島南部山區里，隨時襲擊日軍，使日軍疲於應付。</p>
<p>在一九三六年四月，趙侗離開滿洲到北平。就在這個時候，日本正在壓迫華北的中國當局，要求脫離中央而「自治」。他和他的同志們預料事件的結局，勢必發生衝突，因此就開始考察北平四郊的地勢，特別是調查散藏於農村間的槍械，有關軍事的重要地理，以及探聽一般　衆的情緒與意見。（未完）</p>
<h3>「飛天馬賊」觀感</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Ride　A　Crooked　Mile”</p>
<p>在「新水滸」中飾演一個率直，豪爽的海盜的亞金泰密洛夫，曾引起觀衆們很大的注意。他的作風是相類於華爾斯皮萊的。果然，由於「新水滸」的一鳴驚人，現在他獨擋一面來主演這部「飛天馬賊」了。</p>
<p>在「飛天馬賊」中，他的哥薩克族領袖麥克巴倫，又是多麼適合於他那種作風的一個人物呢！粗野，豪爽，記不起他曾在二十年之前和一個俄籍女子（曼麗）結過婚，也記不起自己有一個二十歲的兒子；但是當他知道自己的兒子也是個「勇悍活潑」，饒有乃父風的時候，父子的天性激發他決計「棄邪歸正」（他是個移居在美國的偷牛賊），這是多麼可愛的一個人物呢。可是，在他預備挈他的兒子（他本來呌蒙高茂萊，因爲他不喜歡這名字，改呼約翰）作環遊世界之舉的時候，政府查獲了他偷牛的證據，於是他打入了牢獄。約翰爲了帮助他父親脫獄，投入美國騎警隊服務，道樣可以「妥爲劃策」，可是當他帮助父親逃獄的計劃開始以後，他覺得兵士應「盡忠報國」的，所謂「忠孝不能兩全」，這故事是非常動人的。至於我所以介紹這故事的理由，因爲它太像華爾斯皮萊的「舐犢情深」和「賊人之子」了，同時，我私人是很喜歡道樣的電影的。</p>
<p>而且，超主題地說，方今的時候，我們是應該鼓勵那些「其父攘羊，而子證之」的檢舉「老頭子」的罪狀的兒子的。</p>
<p>至於「飛天馬賊」的演出，導演者對於亞金泰米洛夫的這人物寫得非常動人的，尤其是在前半部戲中。如：在牛塲中他的手下來吿訴他有一個女人要見他；會見他的妻子；會見他的兒子；和兒子搏鬬；和兒子試馬等等許多塲面中，麥克巴倫的性格是抓得緊極了。而目也非常風趣。醫如父子試馬那塲戲，他是這樣寫的：（一）父親躍上馬背；（二）兒子像不善於騎馬似的在馬背上伏着；（三）麥克巴倫縱馬疾馳，表演騎術；（四）兒子見父親去遠了，一躍而下，跳上另一匹兇悍的馬，追上去，也表演各種騎術；不但風趣，連兒子的性格也明顯地刻劃出來了。</p>
<p>介紹俄女特麗娜出塲，也見導演者的巧思。他先寫試馬的時候，約翰聽見特麗娜的歌聲，在他們父子倆憩息的時候又重覆介紹了一次歌，才使約翰和特麗娜相見。而在宴會席上，特麗娜站起來唱歌的時候，約翰馬上接上去唱着雄壯的哥薩克歌。織接上也是很緊湊的。後半部中，因爲交叉地寫麥克巴倫入獄，和的翰投入美國騎警隊，不免顯得鬆懈了一點。但在麥克巴倫逃獄，約翰奉命追捕，在地窖中的那塲戲還是很好的。如麥克巴倫最後說：「現在我們是敵人了！」他把兒子一拳打暈過去，才逃走，父子天性的流露還是很感動人的。</p>
<p>「飛天馬賊」或許是一張「挿片」，但和上期公映的「黑傘大盜」，或其他胡鬧的歌舞片等比起來，它還不失爲優秀之作。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第八回　是幻是眞逢塲作戲　宜行宜止到處為家</p>
<p>蘇理雅太太聽了，立刻答應捐出運輸卡車十輛，裝配到中國來，愈速愈妙。有一回，也是她的一位女朋友在中國西北方面，也不知是不是八路軍那邊，吿訴她医藥缺乏，她又獨力捐了一萬元美金的藥品。諸如此類的捐款，她也捐過不少。此刻她也曾發過了一個宏願，她說：『從中國方面賺來的錢，還供中國方面的用。她並不要刮取中國人的錢，回到美國去的。因爲她自己的富，也足够了，美國的富，也足够了。』這話是金澹雲親聽得她講過的，而且她也很贊美金澹雲，要請金澹雲去當她的顧問咧。她這回到中國來，對於中國的投資，僅僅取決了兩件，還是從以前　捐款，推闡出來的。一件是開辦了個汽車製造廠，一件是創立了個製藥公司。回想到中國在戰前時，自己不能製造汽車，所有的汽車，都是舶來品。一年所有進口的汽車，爲數着實可觀。後來公路越開越多，需要的汽車愈用愈多，而自己不能製造汽車，多築幾條公路，便是給外國廠家，多銷幾十輛幾百輛汽車。然而車輛總是不够用的，因此到了戰時，連運輸傷兵的卡車，也感到缺乏了。到了戰後，中國製造汽車的公司，平添了好幾家了。這一個製造汽車公司，是蘇理雅夫人和中國幾個老朋友合資設立的。總共資金是國幣一千萬元，蘇理雅夫人却占有半數。在從前，外國人在中國所辦的工商業，往往在他們名號上，標明是某國商人所辦。如美國商人所辦，稱之爲美商；英國商人所辦，稱之英商，現在早不標明此種名稱了。除了國內幾種事業，應該由國家經營的，規定爲國營之外，凡是允許由民間和私人自由營業的，不必在個人間分出什麼國界來。因爲在中國的國權統制之下，不論何國人，不論何國人的資本，都可以自由營業，都可以受中國的保護。用不着標明某商某商，以示識別。蘇理雅夫人這個汽車製造廠，却是專製造新型發明的那種公用汽車，不是專造那種個人代步用的安閑汽車。因爲近年來汽車爲用愈廣，差不多無論何業都用得着汽車咧。（九四）</p>

<h3>Chinese Army Scores Another Victory in Counteroffensive – Multiple Key Positions Recaptured in Northern Jiangxi and Southern Hubei – Japanese in Gao’an Suffer Heavy Losses, Abandon City and Flee Northeast – Chinese Forces Retake Tongshan, Meet from Two Flanks, Reconnoiter and Advance – Xin Street on the Yuehan Railway Recovered; Chinese Forces Press Jiangcun in Pursuit</h3>
<p>(Changsha) Since the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi launched its full-scale counteroffensive, successive victories have followed. On the 23rd alone, Gao’an, Xiangfuguan, Wanshougong, Shitougang, Shiwenjie and other positions were retaken, and Tongshan in southern Hubei was also recovered today. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiushui – Chinese forces besieging Gao’an from all directions have won one victory after another. In recent days, the Japanese in the city have found themselves trapped like fish in a boiling pot. At 6:30 this morning, the Chinese advance detachment, displaying remarkable courage, stormed into Gao’an. After two hours of intense street fighting and close-quarters combat, the Japanese abandoned the city and fled northeast. The Chinese then recaptured Gao’an, killing over 200 Japanese troops and seizing 17 light and heavy machine guns, more than 60 rifles, and countless other military supplies and documents. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Pingjiang – Under cover of night on the 22nd, a Chinese unit launched a lightning-fast surprise assault on Japanese forces in Tongshan. Fierce fighting raged until dawn, leaving more than 100 Japanese dead. Exhausted, the enemy retreated southward toward Linqiao, and the Chinese formally secured Tongshan. Riding their success, they pursued the remnants of the enemy while simultaneously searching captured supplies and liberating compatriots. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Pingjiang – After seizing Tongshan, Chinese forces pushed westward in pursuit. Another fresh unit advanced northward toward Nanlinqiao in coordination, and the two columns have already established firm contact. The Japanese garrison at Yinjunqiao, now encircled, will be easily eliminated. Reports indicate that this morning, as the Japanese withdrew from Tongshan, they destroyed all road and rail bridges at the west gate, fearing Chinese pursuit. Their panic was evident. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Yingde – On the night of the 20th, Chinese forces launched a fierce attack on Japanese troops at Xin Street. The Japanese resisted tenaciously in a brutal battle, but the Chinese, undeterred by enemy fire, pressed forward. By 3 a.m. on the 21st, they found Japanese bodies piled everywhere. With the enemy unable to hold, Xin Street was retaken. On the 22nd, riding the momentum of victory, Chinese forces advanced toward Jiangcun, where the remaining Japanese already showed signs of wavering. The Chinese are now assaulting fiercely. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan – On the night of the 20th, Chinese assault troops raided the Japanese at Xin Street, meeting stiff resistance and battling until dawn. Over 100 Japanese were killed or wounded. Having achieved their objective, the Chinese withdrew to their original positions. On the night of the 22nd, Chinese forces struck around Yuzhongtan, heavily damaging the Japanese before withdrawing. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to recent Chinese reports, yesterday Chinese forces entered Gao’an, and a detachment reached a point less than ten kilometers from Nanchang. However, they later withdrew slightly when a large Japanese force arrived and pressed them hard. The disparity in numbers forced the pullback. Chinese morale remains high, and they are confident of overcoming Nanchang. (23rd Huatong Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangshu – On the afternoon of the 22nd, after retaking key positions around Gao’an city, Chinese forces launched a heavy assault on the west and north gates. The Japanese defenders continued to resist, but the Chinese, employing intense artillery fire and supported by numerous aircraft, fought a fierce battle. By around 8 p.m., another Chinese column approached the east gate, and with artillery and air support unable to break enemy defenses, the Chinese completed the encirclement. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Multiple Key Positions Retaken along Entire Northern Jiangxi Front</h3>
<p>Shanggao – (1) The troops crossing the river to attack Shitougang captured the area around Donghualing in Taocun on the 22nd, overcoming the Japanese defenders. A detachment continued sweeping the area, and after close-quarters combat, by 3 p.m. today they occupied Shitougang. Over 200 Japanese bodies were left behind, and the Chinese captured one light machine gun and 96 rifles. (2) Another unit advancing on Wanshougong via Xishan, after capturing Baijiashan, engaged the Japanese again and by 3 a.m. had fully secured Wanshougong, killing over 100 Japanese and taking many prisoners.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Obligation to Pay Taxes</h3>
<p>Recently, in the local news columns of Shanghai newspapers, there have been occasional discussions of stamp taxes and income taxes. Although I am not thoroughly familiar with the current tax situation in Shanghai, I feel compelled to offer some general reflections.</p>
<p>Most people do not clearly understand the nature of taxation. Consequently, they often equate government taxation with official extortion, and see their personal tax payment as akin to being skimmed off in a gambling pool. It is not that they do not recognize the legality of taxation, but in their minds “legality” is nearly synonymous with “coercive authority.” Nor is it that they do not accept that paying taxes is a duty—in their view, performing a duty is almost the same as suffering an injustice. These misconceptions have complex roots and cannot be corrected overnight. Therefore, new taxes are very difficult to implement effectively; Shanghai’s stamp tax has long been notorious for its difficulty, and the even newer income tax faces greater resistance still. Moreover, in these extraordinary times, though the legal basis for taxation in Shanghai remains unchanged, the perception of government authority and coercion, or of tax duties as grievances, differs from the past. Hence, revenue from stamp and income taxes has sharply declined.</p>
<p>What I wish to emphasize is the fundamental point that while the government is represented by officials, government and officials are not the same; and taxation and extortion are not synonymous. Citizens have a legal obligation to pay taxes, but fulfilling that duty is not realized through government authority or official coercion, but through the spontaneous sense of responsibility of the people. Authority and coercion by officials become necessary only because people fail to perform their duties. Thus, in times of peace, government authority and official enforcement go unchallenged, and people dutifully comply—this is taken for granted. But in exceptional circumstances, when government authority and enforcement falter, yet people still fulfill their obligations, that is the truest sign of patriotism. This spirit is not limited to taxation alone. In matters of national unity, it is not solely the armed forces that preserve unity at all times, but the entire populace’s heartfelt support; in legal governance, it is not only the courts enforcing laws, but the willingness of all citizens to abide by the rule of law; in loyalty to leadership and obedience to central authority, it is not coercion that matters but voluntary support and obedience of the people. In each case, these outcomes arise not from authority or coercion, but from a sense of duty.</p>
<p>The concept of duty has an intrinsic moral value far beyond coercion. If a task is carried out only under coercion, without any sense of duty, it is done reluctantly, concerned only with its burdens, not its significance. Why? Because there is no sense of duty. Those unaware of duty pay taxes only under coercion; once conquered, they become docile subjects, forced to pay tribute to foreign rulers just as they did to their own state. Patriotic citizens, however, when they retain their freedom, do not feel coerced in their payments but fulfill their obligations willingly. Duty is not determined by circumstances; the relationship between state and citizen can be compared to that of husband and wife. The husband owes duties to his wife, and the wife owes fidelity to her husband—this is duty. Such duties must be upheld even when the couple are apart; the husband owes his responsibilities even when powerless, the wife her fidelity even when absent. If, when the husband is weak, the wife fails to remain faithful, or vice versa, their relationship cannot endure. The same is true of state and citizen. If, when the state’s power wanes, citizens fail to perform their duties, that is a disgrace to the people and a betrayal of patriotism.</p>
<p>In view of the above, though Shanghai citizens have repeatedly demonstrated patriotism, reports of sharply falling tax revenues reveal a contradiction that cannot resolve itself. Are there still those who confuse government taxation with official extortion and lack an inner sense of tax obligation?</p>
<h3>Chinese Society for Land Administration Holds Fifth Annual Meeting; Over Seventy Attendees; President Chiang Delivers Encouragement</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The fifth annual meeting of the Chinese Society for Land Administration opened in Chongqing at 8 a.m. on the 23rd, chaired by the society’s director, Xiao Zheng. Minister Chen Lifu addressed the gathering, noting that land administration is fundamental to achieving local autonomy. Tasks such as population surveys, conscript training, land registration, reclamation of wasteland, development of transportation and production all depend on the careful research of the delegates to guide government policy. At 2 p.m., the first plenary session discussed China’s postwar land policy. On the morning of the 24th, the second plenary session will address land and economic reconstruction in Southwest China, with the closing ceremony in the afternoon. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) On the morning of the 22nd, the Chinese Society for Land Administration held its opening ceremony for the fifth annual meeting at Sichuan East Normal School. Presided over by director Xiao Zheng, President Chiang delivered an address of encouragement. The Central Executive Committee sent Minister of Social Affairs Chen Lifu to the meeting, and representatives from the Ministries of Education and Interior also attended. Land administration agencies from each province were represented, bringing detailed reports. As of last night, over seventy individuals had registered, including noted figures such as Ji Yu, Zhu Zongliang and Li Jinglu, along with more than ten institutional members. Special delegates in attendance included Zeng Jikuan, Academic Dean of the National Northwest Agricultural College; Gao Xin, Director of the Guangdong Land Administration Bureau; Tang Qiyu, Director of the Jiangxi Reclamation Office; Zhu Ping, Deputy Director of the Sichuan Provincial Land Reporting Office; Tang Huisun, Director of the Yunnan Reclamation District of the West China Reclamation Company; and Zhang Daochun, representing the Shaanxi Provincial Civil Affairs Department. The society received over fifty papers and essays, which have been compiled into conference proceedings and special publications, providing valuable reference for future land administration research. In his address, President Chiang quoted from the Book of Rites: “Goods that the evil man loathes to abandon on the ground need not be hoarded for oneself; powers that one loathes not to exert upon the body need not be used for oneself.” These words capture the essence of developing land resources and maximizing livelihood benefits. The party’s principle of equal land rights, as proclaimed in its founding program under the National Reconstruction Guidelines, and the concrete methods laid out in the Local Autonomy Implementation Law, demonstrate that land is the foundation of the people’s livelihood and must be used and distributed effectively. Monopolization of land leads to neglect, social inequality and hampers economic progress. Only by wholeheartedly studying and devising sound policies can we ensure that the plowman never lacks his tool, fulfilling the decades-long party advocacy on land reform. This will not only secure food and arms and aid the current war effort, but victory will present an excellent opportunity for thorough implementation of the land policies of the principle of livelihood. I urge you to respond to the times, examine good laws, carry out focused research and formulate concrete proposals. After this meeting, continue sectional studies. Outline overall plans, detail specific policy measures, draw on past lessons and offer practical methods. I hope you will diligently fulfill this mission. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Southern Shanxi Suffer Heavy Losses; Large Numbers of Corpses Transported North; Japanese Troops in Taiyuan and Yuci Redeployed; Chinese Forces Recapture Old City and Continue Northward</h3>
<p>Yuanqu – On the 20th, more than 600 Japanese corpses were transported north from Wenxi; over 200 remained in the city. At Poting and Xiangshanzhuang, some 70 to 80 bodies lay along the route; at Xiaodazexi, Guocun, and Shangguocun, over 300 corpses had been piled up, bringing the total to more than 1,400. All were Japanese soldiers killed in the Zhongtiao Mountains battles who had not yet been cremated. Moreover, on the afternoon of the 15th, over 400 additional Japanese bodies were shipped north from Anyi, pushing the total toward 2,000. This partial tally already reveals a glimpse of the grievous losses the Japanese army has suffered. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji – The Japanese forces at Taiyuan and Yuci are being shifted in all directions toward Xing County and Pingyao, with designs to attack Fen County. Those who penetrated southward along the Baijin highway have entirely withdrawn to Nanguan Town and the areas north of it. The Japanese formerly holding Wanghe Town have also pulled back; a Chinese unit is advancing on Nanguan Town. Another Japanese reinforcement unit is pressing Qianzhuang at Zihong Nanguan. Fearing their rear lines will be cut, the Japanese have urgently dispatched additional troops to meet them. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji – Chinese forces in southeastern Shanxi have scored victories. (1) The Japanese troops attacking Yushe via Maling Pass were routed; Maling Pass was recaptured by the Chinese army. The remnants of the Japanese force fled northward, and Chinese units are now advancing on Taigu. The Baijin highway has been severed by Chinese operations, and Japanese survivors along the watershed ridge find themselves trapped; Chinese forces are in the process of annihilating them. (2) The Japanese attack on Qinyuan was repelled by a Chinese blockade, forcing them to retreat to Pingyao; no Japanese presence remains at Wanghe Town. (3) The Japanese who had invaded the old town of Panshi (northwest of Wuxiang) were subjected to fierce assaults by multiple Chinese units. After several days and nights of intense fighting that left the fields littered with Japanese bodies, the survivors retreated to the watershed ridge. Chinese forces then recaptured the old town and surrounding areas, pressing northward. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji – Japanese reinforcements continue moving south. At dawn on the 30th, over 1,000 Japanese troops boarded a single train car traveling southward. Between Lingshi and Nanguan, the train was blown off the tracks by Chinese forces, killing over 100 Japanese soldiers. Meanwhile, more than twenty Japanese transport vehicles, fully laden with ammunition and having set out from east of Linfen the previous day, were ambushed by a Chinese contingent at Shangyang, leaving over 60 Japanese dead and three vehicles destroyed. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji – On the southern section of the Tongpu railway, operations continue to proceed smoothly. Japanese forces in the areas of Hejin, Jingshan, Xinjiang, and Fencheng, repeatedly attacked by Chinese units, have concentrated their troops to hold defensive positions. The Japanese at Hejin are reportedly in a state of panic and have recently blocked off all mountain passes with stringent security measures. Fierce fighting persists east of the railway line. Japanese troops from Linfen attempted to reinforce eastward but were intercepted northwest of Fushan by a Chinese detachment. Over 700 Japanese infantry and cavalry reinforcements dispatched from Linfen were engaged in four hours of combat, leaving more than 100 Japanese dead. The exhausted Japanese then withdrew southward. Chinese units are now coordinating a sweeping operation in the Fushan area. (23rd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Forces Recapture Wangyu</h3>
<p>Xingji – In the early morning of the 19th, Japanese troops attacked and occupied Wangyu (under Fenxi). The Chinese army, exploiting the Japanese unstable foothold, launched counterattacks along multiple routes. After three back‑and‑forth assaults and fierce combat, Wangyu was finally retaken on the evening of the 19th, along with surrounding key positions. The routed Japanese fled in disorder. Earlier, on the morning of the 18th, more than 300 Japanese soldiers attacked Luohan but were intercepted from multiple directions by Chinese units, encircled on three sides, and engaged in six hours of chaotic fighting, leaving over 100 bodies on the field. Survivors scattered around Zhongli, still seeking to operate. Also on the morning of the 18th, over 200 Japanese troops advanced in two columns toward Huadongfang; Chinese forces lured them into a trap, then sent detachments to strike their rear, completely encircling and crushing them. The Japanese disintegrated and fled in disarray. At dawn on the 19th, Chinese units launched surprise attacks on Japanese forces in Wenshui and Jiaocheng, achieving further success. More than ten breaches were made in the Wenjiao highway by Chinese demolition teams, severing Japanese communications and causing great alarm. The Japanese holding the Xinyi area have been under sustained attack by Chinese forces for several days and have suffered heavy casualties. On the night of the 19th, Japanese units launched a two‑pronged assault on Yangpo and Yinjia but were engaged in all‑day fierce fighting by a Chinese unit and ultimately failed, retreating back to Xinyi.

<h3>Two Major European Diplomatic Efforts: Tireless Maneuvering for Influence; Small Countries Assure Germany They Feel No Threat; Hitler to Use This to Deflect Roosevelt</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is now planning a powerful diplomatic campaign, especially in Eastern and Southeastern Europe, aimed at consolidating the totalitarian nations’ bloc and defeating the democratic “peace bloc.” Senior officers from Germany, Italy, and Spain are said to be convening a general staff conference, though this has not yet been confirmed. German officials admit that they have discussed President Roosevelt’s peace proposal with the relevant countries. The National Socialist Party also acknowledges that Führer Hitler intends to use the small countries’ replies to Germany as his response to President Roosevelt at the Reichstag session scheduled for April 28. (23rd AP)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Observers here have claimed that in his address to the Reichstag on the 28th, Hitler, replying to President Roosevelt, will declare that Europe’s small nations have assured him they feel no threat from Germany. Romania’s Foreign Minister Qiafengge, when consulting Germany recently, officially stated that if his country’s border security and sovereign independence are guaranteed—regardless of the guarantor—they would be welcome. Hitler is also expected to assert that bilateral agreements are more effective than multilateral ones, though such a policy in the Balkans has been obstructed by the Balkan Entente. Consequently, Germany and Italy plan to act together in this region, seeking to draw Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Hungary into an Axis group to undermine the Entente. When Yugoslavia’s Foreign Minister Markovitch visited Berlin before the 26th, German authorities certainly urged concrete cooperation with Germany and Italy; Germany is the primary market for Yugoslav exports, accounting for fifty percent of them. In the future, a conference of Danubian and Balkan nations backing the Axis might be convened, though this remains uncertain. (23rd Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Speculation has begun here about what stance Hitler will take next Friday when replying to President Roosevelt’s appeal for peace. According to information obtained by Reuters’s diplomatic correspondent, aside from the outlook for German‑Polish relations, there is little basis for firm conclusions. The Sunday Times’s correspondent in Warsaw reports that Germany plans to apply significant diplomatic pressure on Poland to prevent it from aligning with the Western powers. (23rd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Warsaw) Partial mobilization in Poland is still underway, with estimated daily costs exceeding 40,000 pounds sterling. Residents of the Free City of Danzig expect its status to change soon, but Polish public opinion remains entirely unwilling to make concessions. Ethnic Germans in Poland have been arrested for offenses against the state. Estonian Army Commander‑in‑Chief General Letonna arrived in Warsaw on Tuesday for talks with Polish General Staff officials; originally scheduled to depart today, he has extended his stay to April 24. (22nd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the German government instructed its envoys in European capitals to inquire whether their host nations felt threatened by Germany, local political circles have commented that Berlin is essentially seeking certificates of “good neighborliness” from each small state to thwart Anglo‑French efforts to form an anti‑aggression bloc. This tactic is likely to backfire. The Soviet government’s counterproposal to Britain yesterday advocated mutual security commitments explicitly targeting Germany. Should the small countries now declare absolute confidence in Germany, they would remove any need to join collective security arrangements. Germany’s line of questioning thus aims to forestall these alliances. The British and French have seen through this strategy and, while they continue to seek Soviet cooperation to maintain European order, they do not demand guarantees from small states that they cannot provide—such demands would only expose them to greater threats. Moreover, Italy is working to draw Yugoslavia and Hungary into its orbit, and Germany is active in Turkey, both aiming to undermine the Balkan Entente. Yet Romania and Greece are firmly guaranteed by Britain and France, and Turkey is in active negotiations with them, so Germany’s efforts are unlikely to prevail. In short, Britain and France are fully aware of all Axis maneuvers and will not ignore them. (22nd Havas)</p>
<h3>Various Countries Submit Replies to Germany</h3>
<p>Athens – Prime Minister Medaxasas told a Havas reporter that the German government inquired whether Greece felt threatened by Germany. “I replied that our country has never been threatened by yours, and there is no concern for our friendly diplomatic relations,” he said. Rumors that Bulgaria harbors territorial ambitions are groundless. (22nd Havas)</p>
<p>Belgrade – Officials here declare that Germany did not formally ask Yugoslavia whether it felt threatened, but their envoy Ambassador Hiren did seek opinions informally. Since Germany annexed Austria and thus became Yugoslavia’s neighbor, bilateral relations have improved. (23rd Havas)</p>
<p>Helsinki – The German government posed two questions to Finland: (1) whether it had prior knowledge of President Roosevelt’s telegram to Germany and Italy, and (2) whether Finland felt threatened by Germany. The Finnish government replied that it had not been threatened and was unaware of Roosevelt’s telegram in advance. (23rd Havas)</p>
<p>Stockholm – German Minister Prince Witt, citing President Roosevelt’s telegram, asked Foreign Minister Sandler whether Sweden felt threatened by Germany. Sandler immediately replied, “No.” No official communique is expected. (23rd Havas)</p>
<h3>Netherlands Determined to Defend Its Independence</h3>
<p>The Hague – Political circles here have declared that the Dutch nation, known for its courage and endowed with patriotic zeal and creative spirit, is determined at any cost to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. This stance is the strongest barrier against aggression. Should the threat of war become more pronounced, the government stands ready to place the country under a wartime regime. The colonies will assist in manpower and supplies—especially petroleum—to support national defense. Military observers estimate that full mobilization would field a well‑trained army of some 300,000. Although the Dutch fortifications cannot match France’s Maginot Line, the country’s extensive inland waterways form natural barriers; in an emergency, large areas can be flooded within hours to halt an enemy advance.

<h3>Britain, France, and Germany Pursue Diplomatic and Economic Measures Toward Romania; Romanian Foreign Minister Travels to London</h3>
<p>(London) The Times reports that Britain’s security guarantee to Romania is unilateral and does not envisage a mutual defense pact. Additionally, the British government has dispatched an economic mission to negotiate with Romanian authorities and may extend a credit of £2.5 million, though this remains unconfirmed. (23rd Havas)</p>
<p>(Bucharest) The British commercial delegation is due here on Monday. Meanwhile, the Germans are pressing to implement the recently signed German‑Romanian economic agreement, putting Bucharest’s officials and business community in a difficult position. Huldart, who led the German economic mission for that agreement, has returned here, joined by two German business delegations of fifteen members each. Today’s news indicates that the German automotive engineer Bischsgna will arrive soon to study the feasibility of constructing military roads. Under the agreement, a joint German‑Romanian company has been formed to develop oil fields; the first region has been designated, and five Romanian representatives departed today for Berlin to survey methods for adjusting Romanian commercial operations in Czechoslovakia. (22nd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Bucharest) French petroleum representative Vinje signed a contract on the 31st with Romanian Economy Minister Puirihua, under which Romania will sell France 700,000 tons of petroleum annually. He then concluded an additional contract for 400,000 tons of petroleum and by‑products, to be delivered by March 31, 1940. Under these agreements, Romania will receive 500 million francs in cash—equivalent to one‑quarter of its annual petroleum export value. Political circles here comment that foreign powers’ attempts to expand their influence in Romania’s oil industry will be checked. Presently, ninety percent of Romania’s oil sector is controlled by British, French, Belgian, and American interests. (22nd Havas)</p>
<p>(Bucharest) Romanian Foreign Minister Qiafengge held talks last night at Lugoj with Ambassador Dattelesco, concluding early this morning. He then boarded a ship for consultations in Britain. Ambassador Dattelesco has returned to Paris. (23rd Havas)</p>
<p>(Brussels) Romanian Foreign Minister Qiafengge completed his consultations here last night and departed for London. Before leaving, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Pierlot hosted a farewell banquet for him, attended by Economy Minister Sabro and the Romanian Minister to Belgium, Radulesco. (23rd Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<p>(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Qiafengge is expected to arrive in London on Sunday afternoon, where British Foreign Secretary Halifax will meet him at Victoria Station. The two will begin talks on Monday morning, with Britain’s guarantee to Romania a key agenda item. (22nd Reuters)</p>
<h3>Nordic Countries Determined to Remain Neutral</h3>
<p>Stockholm – Prime Minister Hansson declared today that the peoples of the Scandinavian countries will maintain strict neutrality should a war erupt among the great powers. (23rd Reuters)</p>
<p>Stockholm – Today marks the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Swedish Social Democratic Party. Its leader, Prime Minister Hansson, delivered a speech stating that, given the present European situation, the nation unanimously advocates a policy of neutrality. “Our country supports international cooperation but opposes joining any alliance,” he said. Above all, Sweden will remain neutral to avoid being drawn into the vortex of international conflict. All Nordic nations share this aspiration and will assist each other to overcome the difficulties arising from the international crisis. (23rd Havas)</p>
<h3>U.S. Resolves to Provide Ample Financial Aid to Britain and France; Economists Predict They Can Sustain for Two Years</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury experts have submitted a report to President Roosevelt outlining measures should war break out in Europe. Key recommendations include: (1) If war erupts suddenly, suspend trading on exchanges for several days to allow markets to stabilize. (2) If the European situation deteriorates, the U.S. government, under the “business as usual” principle, will ensure that gold flows among Washington, London, and Paris remain uninterrupted, maintaining existing currency agreements. Furthermore, if Britain and France wish to draw on assets held by their citizens in the U.S., the Treasury will facilitate such transfers, although congressional approval of a special bill will be required. Economist Gardiner, writing in the Wall Street Journal, expressed optimism that Britain and France—holding substantial gold and dollar reserves in the U.S.—will not face immediate financial shortages. They can import necessary war materials for two years without borrowing, and having already stockpiled large quantities of food and armaments, they are well prepared and unlikely to panic as they did in 1914. (22nd Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today authorized the War Department to place orders with six private factories for various military supplies, both to train workers and to ready the facilities for conversion to armaments production if needed. The factories will install machinery and equipment for manufacturing gas masks, semi‑automatic rifles, searchlights, antiaircraft gun components, and dual‑purpose 75mm shells, among other items. (22nd Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) The punitive duties on German imports to the United States took effect last night. These duties aim to penalize Germany for violating American neutrality and engaging in aggression in Europe. It is expected that German exports to the U.S. will come to a complete standstill. Over the past two weeks, large shipments of German goods were sent to the U.S. in an attempt to evade these duties. (23rd AP)</p>

<h3>China, Having Already Ordered Large Batches of Aircraft from the U.S., Also Buying Massive Quantities of Military Uniform Cloth; Contract Signed for Fifty-Four High‑Speed Aircraft; Further Purchase of Twenty Million Yards of Madayuan Cloth from Manchester</h3>
<p>(New York) Regarding the New York Times report that China is purchasing US$7–15 million worth of fighter planes from the United States, the Chinese Embassy in Washington professes ignorance and the American Aircraft Materials Export Company declines to comment. According to an Associated Press investigation, two weeks ago a representative of United Aircraft, Pederson, signed a contract in Chongqing with Dr. H. H. Kung, China’s Minister of Finance. After Pederson’s return to the United States, he met in Los Angeles with Mr. Neitman of the American Aircraft Materials Export Company and with officials of the China Aviation Power Company. In addition to fifty‑four high‑speed Seversky single‑seat fighters, the deal includes aircraft materials valued at some US$3–4 million and an unspecified number of Ryan trainers for novice pilots. (23rd, AP dispatch)</p>
<p>Manchester—According to last night’s local reports, the Chinese government intends to purchase twenty million yards of military uniform cotton cloth from various mills here, at a cost of about £500,000. It is said the government has already placed an order for £30,000 worth of uniform cloth. (23rd, AP dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anti‑Aggression Front: Does It Include the Far East? Heated Discussions in London and Paris; Soviet Ambassador to Britain Returns to His Post</h3>
<p>(London) Whether the Far East will be included in the Anglo‑French‑Soviet anti‑aggression pact remains a matter of speculation. According to reports from Paris, none of the information received here yesterday has been confirmed. Commentators generally expect that once Soviet Ambassador Maisky returns to London, Prime Minister Chamberlain may outline the progress of the negotiations early this week. (23rd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) After two days’ study of the Soviet counter‑proposal, Britain and France have decided to set aside for now a broad collective security plan and instead seek to form a tripartite alliance with the Soviet Union. It is said the Soviets wish the United States to be included in a collective security system for the Far East, and Americans, eager to secure their markets there, would be unlikely to refuse such an arrangement. France, however, is less optimistic about American participation. (23rd, AP dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Daladier yesterday discussed the Soviet counter‑proposal with Foreign Minister Bonnet. Bonnet then promptly summoned Soviet Ambassador Suritz, who urged that France reply to the Soviet proposal as soon as possible. (23rd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) British sources here report that Soviet Ambassador Maisky, after returning from London on official duties yesterday afternoon, held talks with Britain’s Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps. The contents remain undisclosed. Ambassador Maisky is scheduled to depart again early tomorrow morning to convey the Soviet government’s views on the anti‑aggression bloc to the British authorities. (23rd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Well‑informed political circles here claim that Britain’s implementation of limited conscription has become inevitable and the Cabinet is expected to make a firm decision within the next week. Sir William Strang, a government foreign policy adviser who spoke in Paris with the French authorities, has returned to report to Foreign Secretary Halifax that French public opinion is astonished Britain has not yet introduced conscription under the current circumstances. In addition, Lieutenant‑General Sir John Gort, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, has told Prime Minister Chamberlain that without bolstering the army, Britain will be unable to fulfill its recently accepted military obligations. Meanwhile, the War Office has begun recruiting volunteers to double the reserve forces, but results have been disappointing, making it clear that conscription can no longer be postponed. (22nd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The right‑wing French Social Research Party convened an extraordinary meeting here. Its leader, Colonel Raoul‑Lacour, spoke, warning that if war breaks out France should not cooperate militarily with the Soviet Union, which should at most supply raw materials and semi‑finished goods. Contrary to rumors of advanced Soviet weaponry, American aviator Colonel Lindbergh last year pointed out the poor quality of Soviet aircraft. Once war begins, the Soviets would deploy most of their forces against Japan, having neither the time nor the capacity to aid France. Moreover, Romania and Poland would not permit Soviet troops to enter their territories. Thus, Soviet troops cannot venture abroad, and material aid cannot be relied upon. France’s only recourse is to import raw materials and semi‑finished goods while maintaining a benevolent neutrality toward the Soviet Union—this should set the limit of any Soviet assistance.

<h3>Italian Troops in Spain to Withdraw Next Month</h3>
<p>Madrid—Officials here report that Germany’s Condor Legion and the Italian volunteer “Corps” are scheduled to withdraw in the latter half of next month. The weapons they used—aircraft, anti‑aircraft guns, tanks, transports, and rifles—have been purchased by the Nationalist government in cash and will remain in Spain. (22nd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Burgos—Authorities here declare that all rumors of foreign troops entering Spain are false, as are reports concerning Gibraltar and Tangier. These baseless stories serve ulterior motives.

<h3>Hungarian Authorities to Visit Berlin</h3>
<p>Budapest—Last night it was announced that representatives of German and Hungarian industry will meet in early May to discuss how to eliminate trade barriers between the two countries. The greatest current obstacle is the distorted trade balance: Hungary supplies Germany with large quantities of agricultural products whose value far exceeds the industrial goods it imports from Germany. The aim of these talks is to find improvements that protect Hungarian agriculture without harm. (21st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest—According to local reports, Prime Minister Darányi and Foreign Minister Sárközy will depart on the 28th of this month for Berlin.

<h3>Japan Utterly Bankrupt, Forcing People to Save; Many Tokyo Women Reluctant to Serve as Nurses; Shortage of Ordinary Factory Workers</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In the last fiscal year, Japan’s Ministry of Finance launched a national savings campaign, aiming for ¥8 billion daily to fund the enormous costs of the China war and to support industrial expansion. So far, the total saved is ¥7.2 billion—still short of the target. Public subscriptions to government bonds have been disappointing, prompting the authorities to issue an additional ¥500 million in banknotes, further driving up prices. This year the government asks citizens to save ¥100 billion to cover ¥60 billion in government bonds and ¥40 billion for industrial expansion. The Mainichi Shimbun warns this amount may still be insufficient, estimating bond issues alone could reach ¥75 billion. The paper urges the government to adopt stronger measures to boost savings and avert harmful inflation. The Kokumin Shimbun reports that the Finance Minister plans to enforce compulsory savings in the 95,000 munitions‑related factories across Japan, deducting a fixed sum from the pay of any employee earning above prewar wages. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Official surveys show that of Tokyo’s 33,205 qualified female nurses, only 22,618 are practicing. The remaining 10,587, though urgently needed, have left nursing for marriage or other work, or remain idle due to low pay. With dysentery and other illnesses spreading this spring, authorities hope to remedy the nursing shortage by relaxing the strict qualifying exams to encourage more women to enter the profession. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the war in China, Japan’s merchant fleet faces severe crew shortages. Newspaper classifieds are filled with requests for sailors. The Education Ministry is tapping maritime schools to train naval personnel. The navy still needs an estimated 1,000 new officers. Overall, Japanese merchant seamen now fill only 70 percent of the demand. Similar shortages afflict other factories and shops; munitions factories, offering better pay, attract workers away from ordinary factories, causing panic among non‑defense industry workers. Still, Japan added one million tons of merchant shipping last year. (23rd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Invention: New‑Type Aircraft</h3>

<h3>Palestine Question: Britain Asks Egypt to Mediate</h3>
<p>(London) After the failure of the London Round Table Conference on Palestine, the British government, seeking a peaceful solution, has drafted a new plan entrusting Egypt to negotiate with Palestinian Arab representatives. Responsible sources here declare the plan has likely been accepted by the Arabs, and once international conditions stabilize, it will be published in the form of a white paper. At the same time, Britain is in talks with Jewish leaders to encourage their cooperation. Informed sources say the British proposal contains two main points: (1) Palestine is to enter a transitional period of several years before full independence; (2) during this period, there will be one Administrative Council and one Legislative Council jointly organized by Arabs and Jews; although Arabs will outnumber Jews, on matters affecting both communities, the Jewish representatives or the British High Commissioner will have a casting vote. Regarding Jewish immigration to Palestine, the British authorities regard it as a critical issue to be administratively resolved. (22nd, Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Government to Restrict Government‑Funded Overseas Students</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today the Chinese government announced it will limit the number of government‑funded students studying abroad. The new regulation aims to reduce consumption of China’s foreign exchange reserves and to cultivate specialists in military, mechanical, scientific, and medical fields needed during and after the war. Henceforth, students who are not pursuing these subjects must be recalled or have their stipends suspended, except in cases of exceptional academic achievement. Since the outbreak of war, the number of Chinese students abroad has fallen dramatically—from 894 in 1936 to 360 in 1937, and just 59 last year. (23rd, AP dispatch)</p>

<h3>Italy Courting Yugoslavia to Join Anti‑Communist Bloc and Improve Relations with Hungary</h3>
<p>(Belgrade) Some 10,000 youths from various Yugoslav organizations and parties held a rally at the university today, passing a resolution favoring a democratic national government and urging it not to hide secret contacts with aggressor states under the guise of neutrality. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Belgrade) Political observers expect Germany and Italy to invite Yugoslavia to join an anti‑communist bloc, signaling their desire that Yugoslavia not join the Anglo‑French anti‑aggression front. They predict that during Foreign Minister Marković’s visit to Berlin on April 26, Germany will apply pressure. However, responsible sources here doubt Yugoslavia will allow itself to be drawn into such a vortex. (22nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Venice) After talks between Italy’s Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslavia’s Foreign Minister Marković, a joint communique stated that, in light of the international situation and the recent events in Albania, the two countries discussed all related issues. It affirmed their special friendship and agreed that Yugoslavia should develop sincere political and economic cooperation with Italy and work closely with Germany. It also opened a path to better understanding between Yugoslavia and Hungary. (23rd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Venice) Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković and Italy’s Foreign Minister Ciano met for two and a half hours, then toured by motor launch and attended a banquet hosted by Ciano that evening. Responsible sources say the two discussed Europe’s political situation and exchanged views on matters of direct mutual interest. In an interview with the semi‑official Italian news agency Stefani, Marković said relations between the neighboring countries are rooted in common ground. His visit to Ciano was a routine matter intended to reaffirm mutual trust. (22nd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Commenting on the talks between Foreign Ministers Ciano and Marković, Premier Mussolini’s spokesman Gaeta wrote in the Italian daily Popolo d’Italia that the discussions could yield two outcomes: (1) Yugoslavia might soon join the anti‑Communist International, drawing closer to the Berlin‑Rome axis; (2) it could also sign a friendship treaty with Hungary. (23rd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković is now in Venice meeting with Italy’s Foreign Minister Ciano. Berlin newspapers lead with this news, variously headlining it “Extremely Cordial Talks” or “Yugoslavia Maintains Good‑Neighbor Policy.” The Lokal Anzeiger reports Marković will soon visit Berlin. The Börsen‑Zeitung, citing Rome, says the two foreign ministers had three purposes: (1) to discuss Italy’s pending reply to President Roosevelt’s telegraph, with Ciano seeking to understand a neighbor’s views; (2) to discuss issues concerning the Danube region and the Balkans; (3) to plan steps following Italy’s annexation of Albania toward closer ties with Yugoslavia. The Deutsche Tageszeitung adds that once Marković visits Berlin to hold talks with German authorities, he will proceed to Budapest to sign a consultation agreement; Bulgaria is also said to be ready to join. The Volkswart calls Marković’s imminent trip to Berlin evidence of Germany and Italy’s united policy on the Danube region and the Balkans. (23rd, Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Rebirth of Changsha</h3>
<p>— Changren</p>
<p>After Scorched Earth, a Brand‑New Appearance / Buildings Rapidly Rebuilt, People Returning</p>
<p>Changsha dispatch. On the highway from Hengyang to Changsha, only a handful of military vehicles move. At the ferry crossing near Xiangtan—on the eve of Changsha’s great fire—over six hundred vehicles once jostled here awaiting the southward crossing; now only the one we occupy reaches the northern bank. The willows along the roadside and the peach blossoms before the villages almost smile at the farmers driving their oxen to spring plowing. The people of eastern Hunan and from all over the country are intensifying production to support the war and answer the enemy.</p>
<p>Though fierce battles have erupted along both banks of the Xiang River, the front at the Hunan‑Hubei border remains calm. In March, Changsha has already risen from scorched earth. Like the European cities after World War II as depicted by H. G. Wells in The Shape of Things to Come, the people, emerging from devastation, are reconstructing everything from the ruins. Yet it is not so desolate or bleak, for the great Chinese nation is supremely resilient and inventive. I saw Changsha burned only four months ago; now I behold its new face. I admire the courage of the Hunanese, who, barely a hundred kilometers from the front lines, are racing to build a new Changsha.</p>
<p>Once home to over sixty thousand dwellings and several hundred thousand people, Changsha, after the great fire, retained only some ten thousand houses and thirty thousand inhabitants scattered across the east, south, and north. Now new homes rise amid the rubble, and the population has multiplied tenfold, with returning residents still streaming back. Thatched and plank shacks form only a small fraction; well‑finished city houses with decorative doors are gradually increasing. Around South Zheng Road, all the shops one expects in a city are in place. Except for banks and pawnshops, jewelers now outnumber tobacco shops—remarkable though they are far less ostentatious. In fact, they have become Changsha’s financial masters, replacing banks and pawnshops: many people exchange their gold ornaments there for cash, using the proceeds to rebuild homes and businesses. Since society rests on economic foundations, the Central Bank’s Changsha branch will be established in early April. Changsha will undoubtedly grow stronger and more stable through these financial activities.</p>
<p>All the larger hotels were destroyed; in their place over four hundred “large hostels” have sprung up—Sanhe (“Three Harmonies”) is the largest, with thirty to forty rooms; most range from six to fourteen or fifteen rooms. The proprietors of these large hostels are, for the most part, fortunate small citizens with some property. Many shop clerks now happily fill the role of “tea hosts.” Almost every household is a shop, or at least maintains a stall in front. The appearances are quite respectable. Even in the best weather, city dwellers cannot forget air raids. Under Japanese military command, the “flying thieves” target peaceful civilians in crowded areas. Changsha’s more than two hundred thousand evacuated citizens cannot satisfy their bloodlust.</p>
<p>Old department stores sell their remaining stock under the label “temporary shops.” Here “temporary” means until new buildings are completed. New stores often adopt optimistic names reflecting people’s hopes for victory. Yet there are inevitably some “wavering elements”: one eatery called itself the Speculative Pavilion—I suspect its owner has already prepared to leave Changsha at any moment. Prices here are higher than in Hengyang, while in Guilin they are much lower. Most daily necessities come from Wenzhou, rarely from domestic factories. Many brands have sprung up overnight, and a number of trademarks bear hints of the “Red Sun.”</p>
<p>Electric lighting and telephones will soon be restored. Government offices and residences with essential telephone needs already have military lines. Four daily papers—Central Daily (broadsheet), Frontline Daily (four‑page), People’s Daily (small format), and New Citizen Evening News (eight pages)—are in circulation. Recently the papers organized charity sales to benefit troops at the front, with subscribers paying thirty yuan per copy.</p>
<p>Changsha’s night market, though less extensive than before, mirrors daytime crowds. Since electric lights are still being installed, a few shops jointly maintain kerosene street lamps every twenty or so houses; the streets are thus brighter than before. In secluded alleyways, residents group five households to set up a glass‑enclosed kerosene lamp: though dimmer, it greatly aids pedestrians. Some impoverished folks steal kerosene late at night—no light, just oil. On some lamps I have spotted humorous inscriptions in ink or chalk, such as “Back again?” or “Stealing oil—watch out for your wife!” Lamp owners mostly laugh it off, for by the time a kerosene lamp burns through the night, little oil remains to be stolen.</p>
<p>Prostitutes are parasites feeding off military and official circles. In wartime, some women, left without means of support, have been forced into this trade. The provincial government has designated several alleys—such as East Great Thatch Alley—for registered prostitutes, who hang green triangular lights outside their doors at night. But only one hundred and one registered, fearing too much exposure would hurt business. These alleys were once homes of the local elite; now they have been converted into restaurants and inns. In the guest registers of these inns, more than half the names read “Ms. Chen Yanqiu” or “Ms. Xiao Hongyu,” with the annotation “long stay”—a crafty form of advertisement. Before the Lunar New Year, playing cards in hotels was permitted; now it is forbidden. After the Changsha city government merged with the county government, the police bureau came under provincial authority, with a municipal affairs section handling urban administration; the county government manages military service, townships, mutual aid groups, relief funds, grain reserves, and so on. Previously, Changsha city drafted two hundred young men monthly and Changsha county one thousand. After the fire and population dispersal, returns have begun, and recruitment for the conscripts missing in November and December last year has started. The county originally had over a thousand mutual aid units and ninety thousand conscripts; now only seven hundred such units remain. On average, two men drawn per unit per month are sent to the front. To date, fourteen thousand men have been dispatched. The annual relief fund for families of the war dead amounts to over one hundred thousand yuan. However, due to frequent unit reassignments and changing designations, and because many officers have been transferred or killed, families of conscripts often cannot ascertain their loved ones’ fate or obtain proof of death to apply for relief. This issue, affecting future conscription management and common across the nation, should be addressed urgently. As for food, the fire caused massive losses, and with citizens scattered and many troops stationed locally, shortages have become problematic. The provincial and county governments are issuing passports to allow people to transport their rice stocks from neighboring counties for redistribution.</p>
<p>The Rice and Salt Monopoly Office has been reorganized into military‑civil cooperation stations. In northern Hunan there are four stations organized by the Political Department of the Ninth War Area and three by local civilian groups. Their main tasks are to procure fuel, rice, oil, and salt for passing troops, preventing soldiers from buying directly from civilians and causing trouble. Each station also maintains a transport detachment of dozens, composed of local students and conscripts, responsible for carrying wounded soldiers. But the army’s transport needs often exceed these detachments. Initially, the county government could provide dozens or even hundreds of carriers, no problem. Later, however, some units forbade carriers from returning home after reaching certain points, making recruitment difficult. The people often praise well‑supplied armies as good armies. When the 89th Division passed through Changsha, needing no civilian carriers, several farmers spoke highly of it. Yet when working locally, civilians readily volunteer; for example, thousands serve as carriers on Changsha’s nearby defensive works. Road and railway sabotage likewise relies largely on their efforts.</p>
<p>March in Changsha has already risen from scorched earth, for the great Chinese nation is the most resilient and inventive of peoples.</p>
<h3>The Process of the Chinese Army’s Recapture of Zengcheng / Zengcheng Retaken, Renewing the Threat to Guangzhou / Fierce Fighting Over Several Days Inflicts Heavy Casualties on Both Sides / Japanese Send Large Reinforcements but Are Also Repulsed</h3>
<p>Hong Kong dispatch. Zengcheng, east of Guangzhou, west of Huiyang and Boluo, and north of Shilong station on the Canton–Kowloon Railway, commands the throat of traffic on Guangdong’s East River. It was the Japanese army’s only outer stronghold around Guangzhou. The Japanese, deeming the city crucial, deployed large forces inside and built formidable defenses around it, threatening the Bei River area and Conghua. Several months ago, the Chinese army’s fierce counteroffensive on the East River recovered Huiyang and Boluo and advanced on Shilong, directly threatening Guangzhou. However, because the Japanese garrison in Zengcheng held firm, the advance on Guangzhou stalled, and East River forces could do no more than maintain positions at Huiyang and Boluo. This spring, after reorganizing command and reinforcing weaponry, the East River Chinese army, in coordination with Guangdong’s northern forces, resumed attacks on Zengcheng. Unless this city fell, the Chinese would have no possibility of threatening Guangzhou. Yet for months the counterattacks made no progress, chiefly because Japanese‑held positions and unusually robust fortifications around Zengcheng made any assault difficult to succeed. Moreover, the Japanese garrison at Zengcheng and Shilong—numbering two to three thousand troops—was supported by fully mechanized units. Even if the Chinese broke through at one or two points, they dared not push deeply alone.</p>
<p>Only recently, as battles in Jiangmen and Xinhui intensified and the front expanded, Japanese forces had to be drawn away to reinforce those sectors, reducing the Zengcheng garrison. Still, a regiment‑sized force with mechanized troops and artillery remained. Sensing the moment, Chinese command detached two divisions from the Ninth and Twelfth Army Groups, advancing in northeastern prongs. Simultaneously, part of the East River guerrilla units joined. The northern prong advanced from Conghua; the eastern prong crossed the river clandestinely near Gouzitan. By the morning of the 13th, Chinese forces had captured outer positions at Zhuguling, Shetoulng, Jiaoshiling, and Pengwu, completing the encirclement of the inner defenses. That afternoon at six o’clock, both prongs launched simultaneous assaults on the city’s outskirts, pounding the walls. By the early hours of the 14th, Chinese units had reached Zengcheng’s East and North gates. The Japanese fell back within the walls, relying on the fortifications. But under relentless attack, they were driven to desperate last stands. Most of their force attempted a breakout under covering fire from heavy artillery but were repelled by the Chinese, suffering heavy casualties. Intense hand‑to‑hand combat raged. By dawn on the 14th, Japanese fatalities exceeded 400. At this point, the Guangzhou garrison received news and urgently dispatched a large detachment to reinforce Zengcheng and lift the siege. The advance party—four to five hundred infantry and artillery—met prepared Chinese positions on the morning of the 14th; fierce shelling from the previous night into morning repelled them. Inside Zengcheng, Japanese morale and combat power were exhausted. The Chinese then sent a civilian‑clad vanguard into the city for street fighting. Fires broke out across the walls, and with concentrated gunfire and artillery, by evening the entire Japanese garrison had been annihilated. Japanese casualties were severe; Chinese heroic losses were also not few.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province—Comprehensive Military Chronicle of the Entire West River Line / Jiangmen and Xinhui Reduced to Guerrilla Warfare, Japanese Probing at Shanshuikou Eases / West River Chinese Forces to Launch Major Counterattack</h3>
<p>Hong Kong dispatch. In early April, the battle for Jiangmen and Xinhui raged for several days, but disrupted communications left many reports unverified. Two days after Xinhui fell, I traveled from Macau by steamer past Bieyúshā to Shanshuikou, where I met the commander of a brigade in the First Guerrilla Zone. He provided a firsthand account of the battle at Xinhui and an overview of the military situation in the upper West River basin. I record the following as a true field chronicle:</p>
<p>Recollections of the Xinhui Battle</p>
<p>Xinhui’s fall was not due to any lack of bravery among its defenders, but to inferior weapons and overwhelming enemy strength. The garrison—fewer than three thousand men—comprised only the guerrilla units of Li Wuzhi and Zhou Hanling, part of Chi Zhongkuan’s Security Battalion, and local militia. From the first shots on North Street to the city’s fall, no regular army units joined the fight, for Xinhui and the Four Counties were designated a guerrilla zone, with guerrilla warfare as the chief tactic: small forces wearing down the enemy without large numbers. The entire front was divided into three segments: from Tangxia’s North Street to Shuinan (first segment), Jiangmen to Lile (second), and Gongzhou Road to Huicheng (third). In the first segment, centered on Shuinan, fierce fighting at the East Fort in Tangxia’s North Street lasted ten hours, destroying the fort and forcing defenders back to Shuinan, where after another full day of combat they retreated into Jiangmen. In the second segment, centered on Lile, as the first segment withdrew, no troops remained to defend Jiangmen; guerrilla units dispersed to the heights around the city, holding out another day and night while Japanese land, sea, and air forces bombarded Lile, destroying the village and Chinese positions, which then fell back to Huicheng. During the fiercest fighting, neither side entered Jiangmen, so no street battles occurred; only after Chinese forces withdrew from the outskirts did the Japanese occupy Jiangmen. Reports that the city changed hands twice are untrue. In the third segment at Huicheng, fighting raged another day and night under heavy air strikes and cavalry pursuit. Outnumbered, the Chinese held on nearly a week before withdrawing to new positions at Shanshuikou on the 6th. At that point, a fresh army corps arrived to relieve the guerrillas, taking turns holding the line. Currently, the vanguard still holds Daze, Siqian, Fenshui, and Jiangkou. Over ten days, the front has seen no major changes. Japanese casualties exceed 500; Chinese losses are only about a hundred. Fortunately, Jiangmen proper was spared scorched‑earth tactics, thanks to Li Wuzhi’s planning, earning the populace’s gratitude. Recently, wounded Japanese soldiers have been transported back to Guangzhou, where the China University Hospital and the North Army Hospital have been converted into convalescent centers. Military police now search households daily for youths aged fifteen to twenty for blood draws to transfuse the wounded, prompting most local youths to flee the city.</p>
<p>The Situation at Shanshuikou</p>
<p>Shanshuikou lies at the junction of Xinhui, Queshan, and Taishan counties, under Kaiping’s jurisdiction. It is eighty li east of Xinhui, seventy li south of Taishan, over sixty li west of Kaiping, and seventy li north of Heshan. It commands the highway through the four counties of Xin, Heshan, Kaiping, and Taishan, and river routes linking northward to Changsha, Xinchang, Dihai, and Sanbu, and southward to Macau, Yamen, Jiangmen, and Sanmen. Its convenient transport and thriving commerce make it one of the Four Counties’ trade hubs. If Shanshuikou falls, the Japanese can invade west toward Sanbu, south to Taishan, or circle north behind Heshan, imperiling Zhaoqing. After the Huicheng withdrawal, defenders rushed to fortify this position, and reinforcements gathered from all directions to hold it firmly. From the 10th to the 15th, Japanese forces repeatedly attacked from Huicheng toward Daze and Shanshuikou, aiming to break the road defenses and seize this stronghold, but were repulsed each time. After the 16th, the situation eased somewhat, as Japanese troops at Jiangmen were recalled to reinforce the increasingly tense fronts at Dongbei, Jianghua, Conghua, and Zengcheng, relieving pressure on the Four Counties. The Chinese now prepare a counterattack toward Xinhui, fixing Japanese forces and aiding the northern front’s troops.</p>
<p>Bandit Troubles in Muzhou Township</p>
<p>Muzhou lies upstream from Bieyúshā, the waterway that all vessels must traverse to reach Macau from Jiangmen and the Four Counties. After Xinhui fell, refugees—whether by ferry or hired boat—headed for Macau, but many were robbed or killed by bandits at Muzhou, losing clothes, silver, and jewelry. Refugees felt utterly helpless. Zhao Shibei, former head of the Guangzhou District Court and a Xinhui native, after dismissal settled in Limen. On the 12th, unable to find lodging in the countryside, he and his family and neighbors rented two covered boats for Macau, only to fall victim to bandits at Muzhou. Muzhou has long been plagued by brigands; though one pacification occurred years ago, current disorder has overwhelmed authorities, letting criminals exploit the chaos to pillage. Inland civilians, already suffering war, now face bandits with no refuge—a plight without end. Attacks on other river ferries continue to be reported.</p>
<p>Stability in the West River Military Situation</p>
<p>On the north bank of the West River, from Longshan through Jiujiang to the Sanshui River mouth, Japanese forces now occupy the territory. Yet the south bank, from Shaping in Heshan via Sanzhou, Gulou, Fuwan, Jinli to the Zhaoqing Gorge, shows no Japanese presence. According to a Heshan county official, since the Jiangmen battles began, there has been no fighting in the Shaping, Gubu, or Gulou areas. The defensive line there, with strong troop concentrations facing the Japanese across the river at Jiujiang, held firm. During the fiercest fighting at Xinhui, Japanese warships—over ten in number—concentrated at Jiujiang and once attempted to cross at Shaping to attack, but were repelled by Chinese forces and never returned. Thus Shaping, Gubu, and Gulou remained secure throughout. The front is very stable. Recently, Chinese forces in the upper West River have launched successive advances toward the Sanshui River mouth, coordinating with the North River army’s movements in preparation for a general counteroffensive. Consequently, the Japanese along the north bank of the West River are no longer as active as before and are shortening their upstream defensive line, withdrawing to the Sanshui River mouth and Makou. Thus the West River Chinese forces may soon achieve new progress.</p>

<h3>Lingnan University After Relocating to Hong Kong Resuming Classes: Borrowing University of Hong Kong Facilities to Plan an Annam Branch</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong dispatch) After relocating to Hong Kong last winter due to the war, Lingnan University, under President Li Ying-lin’s active planning, has shown vigorous development. The current situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Overview of Each College</p>
<p>The university, now in Hong Kong, is using University of Hong Kong facilities. All students in the Colleges of Arts, Science, and Engineering, as well as first-year students in the College of Agriculture and first- through third-year students in the College of Medicine, attend classes in the HKU buildings. Second- through fourth-year agriculture students do practical work at the Chang Garden in the New Territories. Fourth-year medical students attend lectures alongside HKU medical students at Queen Mary Hospital; fifth- and sixth-year students, pending hospital internships, have not yet resumed classes—some follow Dean Huang in Shaoguan for service, others study in Shanghai. Currently, the university offers one hundred academic programs in Hong Kong, seven to eight fewer than before. Engineering experiments use HKU laboratories; science experiments use HKU’s hydraulics testing plant and chemical laboratories; biophysics and biology experiments are likewise conducted there. Additionally, a site on Caine Road has been rented to house agriculture practice facilities using orchard land, with additional practice grounds at Lai Chi Kok Garden. Medical students have excellent internship opportunities at Queen Mary Hospital. As for library resources, departmental reference books are on loan and displayed at the Fong Ping-shan Chinese Library’s east reading room, and arrangements have been made with HKU’s Western Library to lend materials to Lingnan students. Physical education has been emphasized; during the Hong Kong period, programs have been adjusted to suit local conditions, focusing on indoor sports and outdoor activities (including excursions and visits) to integrate physical training into student life.</p>
<p>(2) Student Enrollment Statistics</p>
<p>This semester, the university has over 600 students:</p>
<p>• College of Arts: 237 (8 in Chinese Language and Literature; 28 in Western Languages and Literature; 35 each in History &amp; Political Science and Sociology; 39 in Commerce; 81 in Economics; 11 in Education)</p>
<p>• College of Science &amp; Engineering: 132 (8 in Biology; 41 in Chemistry; 11 in Physics; 72 in Civil Engineering)</p>
<p>• College of Agriculture: 113 (29 in Animal Production; 84 in Crop Production)</p>
<p>• College of Medicine: 70</p>
<p>• Graduate Institute: 11 (6 in Physiology; 5 in Chemistry)</p>
<p>Of these, three-quarters are male and one-quarter female.</p>
<p>(3) Concurrent Operation of Social Education</p>
<p>In accordance with the Ministry of Education’s “Regulations on Concurrent Social Education for Schools at All Levels,” the university has organized social education work in four groups (Social Survey, Civic Education, Agricultural Extension, Wartime First Aid) covering thirteen projects, staffed by faculty and students from each college.</p>
<p>The university already has branches in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore. It has now accepted a request from the Lingnan University Alumni Association in Indochina to establish a branch in Annam for the education of local overseas Chinese children. Mr. Situ Wei was specially dispatched to plan all details, and the branch is now fully prepared.</p>

<h3>American School for Girls Physical Education Department Initiates Girls’ Play Day: Avoiding Competitive Athletic Strain; Invites All Girls’ Schools in Shanghai to Participate</h3>
<p>Recently, the American physical education community has recognized that competitive sporting events can harm girls’ health, given physiological differences between males and females. They have therefore promoted more social and playful activities, leading to the emergence of “Play Day.” On a warm, breezy day, girls from various schools gather to participate in performances, games, and ball sports, aiming to cultivate body and mind, foster relationships, and eliminate the psychological tension of competition—truly an activity worthy of encouragement. The American School for Girls’ Physical Education Department has thus decided to invite all girls’ schools in Shanghai to participate in the first Shanghai Girls’ Play Day on May 27 at their campus. Invitations have gone to Western schools (English Concession School, Western Girls’ School, North Fourth Girls’ School, Sacred Heart, Loreto) and Chinese schools (Zhongxi, Works Girls’ High School, Chongde, Qixiu, Qingxin, Moor, etc.). A grand occasion is expected. This afternoon at 5:00, the school hopes each invited institution will send at least one representative to an organizational meeting at the American School for Girls, where the Shanghai Girls’ Secondary Schools Athletic Federation will be established to coordinate various girls’ sports activities.</p>

<h3>All Shanghai–Zhejiang Traffic Cut Off; Blockade Enforced at Mouth of the Ou River; Vessels Between Shanghai and Wenzhou Return One After Another; Japanese Warships Still Anchored Offshore with No Movement</h3>
<p>Off the mouth of the Ou River in eastern Zhejiang, four Japanese warships suddenly arrived the day before yesterday, intending to reconnoiter Wenzhou. Three Japanese aircraft then flew over the city district and dropped bombs. As the situation grew increasingly tense, the Wenzhou–Taizhou Defense Command ordered all steamers anchored outside Wenzhou to depart the Ou River by yesterday afternoon and barred any vessels from entering, declaring a blockade of all traffic. The steamer Mo Fu, which set sail for Shanghai yesterday morning, and four steamers bound from Shanghai to Wenzhou—the Te Ping, Ha Na, Fei Kang, and Hai Fu—all turned back. Yesterday, however, the Japanese side remained inactive. Should the situation relax, it is hoped that the blockade will be lifted at once. The following reports summarize each development:</p>
<p>Authorities Announce Blockade of the Ou River</p>
<p>After repeated harassment by Japanese warships and aircraft along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, Chinese military authorities, aiming to strengthen defenses and consolidate local security, had previously proclaimed blockades at the mouths of Dinghai, Haimen, and Zhenhai. To maintain Shanghai–Zhejiang traffic, however, the Ou River at Wenzhou had remained open for navigation. With the sudden arrival two days ago of four Japanese warships at the mouth of the Ou River, anchoring offshore at Wuli and even bombarding the Huanghuaguan Fortress, followed by three Japanese aircraft bombing the urban district (the reports of bombings were confirmed by inquiries to various shipping circles; yesterday’s report of inaccuracy was false), the situation in Wenzhou turned sharply tense. Yesterday, local shipping circles received orders from the Wenzhou–Taizhou Defense Command instructing all steamer companies to direct ships anchored outside Wenzhou to depart the Ou River at noon on the 23rd (yesterday) and to bar any incoming vessels. Thus, the Ou River was officially declared closed to traffic.</p>
<p>Steamer Mo Fu Sets Sail from Wenzhou for Shanghai Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The steamer Mo Fu, owned by the German firm Lihe &amp; Co., departed Shanghai for Wenzhou on the 10th of this month and arrived there on the 21st, where it was loading cargo. It had been scheduled to return to Shanghai today. Upon receiving official notice, it departed the Ou River early yesterday at 10:20 a.m. and returned directly to Shanghai. Company headquarters received a wireless report from Captain Mr. Berg, stating that the vessel is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>All Steamers Bound for Wenzhou Ordered to Return</p>
<p>Although Shanghai’s various steamer companies had received word two days ago of the impending closure of the Ou River, no formal order had yet been issued, so the steamers continued their scheduled sailings. The Te Ping, Ha Na, Fei Kang, and Hai Fu all departed yesterday morning before 9 a.m. for Wenzhou. Around 10 a.m., upon receiving word of the traffic closure, each vessel was instructed via wireless to reverse course and await further orders. Since the blockade was not yet fully confirmed, they were told to anchor offshore outside Wusong and await developments. By 4 p.m., the blockade was fully confirmed, and the Ha Na, Hai Fu, Fei Kang, and Te Ping all departed from Wusong in succession, returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Steamer Bao Li Still Anchored Offshore at Wuli</p>
<p>The steamer Bao Li, operated by the Italian firm Yihua &amp; Co., sailed from Shanghai for Wenzhou at 4 p.m. on the 20th and arrived offshore at Wuli on the morning of the previous day, only to be intercepted by Japanese warships, boarded, and inspected. The boarding party declared that there were military operations in Wenzhou and that no vessels would be allowed to enter, so the Bao Li remained at anchor offshore awaiting developments. A reporter from Modern News inquired of the company yesterday, and the captain, Mr. Reggini, reported by telegram that the Bao Li was still anchored at Wuli. However, due to the weekly holiday, Mr. Reggini was not in the office, so details remain unclear until today. According to Chinese staff members, the vessel is expected to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Situation Between Wenzhou and Ningbo Remains Calm</p>
<p>The four Japanese warships anchored offshore at the mouth of the Ou River bombarded the Huanghuaguan Fortress in Wenzhou on the day before yesterday, but after a fierce counterattack by Chinese garrison forces, the Japanese ships failed in their attempt. Yesterday, Wenzhou remained peaceful all day; Japanese warships and aircraft were inactive, and local order remained serene as ever. In Ningbo, although several Japanese aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights the day before yesterday, no bombs were dropped, and commercial activity continued normally. The German steamer Ender, which remained in Ningbo to load cargo, will return to Shanghai within days upon receiving approval.</p>
<p>All Shanghai–Zhejiang Traffic Completely Cut Off</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of hostilities, Chinese military authorities had designated the Ningbo mouth of the Yong River, the Wenzhou mouth of the Ou River, and the Jiaojiang River at Haimen as open ports for navigation, resulting in frequent shipping and bustling cargo traffic. With the successive blockades of the Jiaojiang and Yong rivers, only the Ou River remained open, and the number of available vessels had been reduced to five following the internment of Portuguese steamers. Now that the Ou River has also been closed, all shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been completely suspended.</p>
<p>If Tension Eases, Blockade May Be Lifted Soon</p>
<p>According to inquiries by Modern News reporters, beginning yesterday the Wenzhou–Taizhou Defense Command ordered all ships barred from entering or leaving the Ou River purely to strengthen fortress defenses and prevent further Japanese harassment. Shipping observers believe this blockade is temporary and not intended to seal the river entirely. Since Shanghai–Zhejiang traffic now relies solely on Wenzhou, a prolonged closure would have severe repercussions. It is therefore anticipated that, if tensions subside even slightly, the river will be reopened and navigation restored at once.</p>
<h3>Intervention in Flag Displays Case; External Authorities Have Submitted the Matter; Verbal Protest Lodged at French Embassy; Confiscated National Flags to Be Returned Today</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute over the French Concession authorities' intervention against citizens displaying national flags, apart from negotiations conducted by the Taxpaying Chinese Merchants Association, various local organizations jointly petitioned the Chongqing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting it lodge a protest with the French Embassy in China and secure assurances that citizens would retain the freedom to display national flags in future. Yesterday, these organizations received a reply from external authorities, stating that, concerning the Shanghai French Concession's intervention in the flag displays case, a verbal protest has been delivered to the French Embassy, demanding that citizens’ freedom to display national flags not be interfered with hereafter. Additionally, the seized national flags from various shops, following negotiations by representatives of the Concession’s Taxpayers’ Association, have been approved for return by the French authorities. However, as of the afternoon before last, they had not yet been returned. Operations at French offices were suspended yesterday due to Sunday observance, so the Taxpayers’ Association will continue its efforts today to recover the flags.</p>
<h3>Customs Again Raises the Issue with the Japanese Side, Requesting Return of Seized Anti‑Smuggling Patrol Vessels; Japan Agreed in Principle, but Timing Unknown</h3>
<p>All twenty‑plus anti‑smuggling patrol vessels belonging to the Jiangnan Customs were seized by the Japanese Navy following the withdrawal of Chinese forces from Shanghai, severely affecting customs anti‑smuggling operations. According to reliable outside sources, British Taxation Commissioner Rockford recently negotiated with the Japanese side, requesting the return of the seized patrol vessels. The Japanese have agreed to return them, but when this will occur remains unknown, as Japanese diplomatic “promises” have an uncertain record of fulfillment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Reinforce Shanghai Suburbs</h3>
<p>Two weeks ago, the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai redeployed Japanese‑collaborationist troops from Shanghai’s defenses to reinforce counter‑guerrilla operations along the Yangtze and in South China as well as along the Beijing–Hangzhou highways, leaving suburban Shanghai thinly defended. Yesterday morning, two transport ships sailed from the mouth of Suzhou Creek to the Yangshupu dock, carrying over 1,000 Korean soldiers by way of Taiwan. These troops were then distributed by military trucks to garrisons in southern Shanghai, Zhabei, and central Hongkou. After unloading the Korean soldiers and military supplies, the two transports are reported to be loading grain for shipment back to Japan.</p>
<h3>Pudong River Barrier Not Yet Blown; Remains Subject to Intermittent Blasting at Any Time, Without Time Restrictions</h3>
<p>At Shiliupu, over a dozen vessels previously sunk to block navigation have remained unremoved by the Japanese, who have resorted to periodic bombardments for several months. Every three to five days, faint explosions can be heard from both the Pudong and Puxi riverbanks, but the charges are small and barely audible. Two crane ships are stationed there to recover iron parts and plates from the riverbed for shipment to Japan, a sizable salvage operation. Although some foreigners reported hearing blasts between 6 and 7 p.m. yesterday, a reporter who inspected Shiliupu did not hear any explosions. Ferry services across the Huangpu River continue as usual, with no suspensions. Ferrymen reported that the demolition teams work only during daylight and depart before dark, and there is no fixed schedule for blasting.</p>
<h3>Foreign‑Operated Buses in Hongkou Face Japanese Harassment; If Carrying Chinese Passengers, Will Be Subject to Inspection by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>According to the English‑language American Evening Post, citing the Japanese‑language Continental News Agency, three unauthorized public buses have recently been operating clandestinely between Yangshupu and the Waibaidu (Garden) Bridge. After ten days of operation, Japanese military police discovered them. On April 7th, they spotted a Ford‑model bus numbered 1930 traveling along Broadway Road and Yangshupu Road, which the authorities believe to be privately operated by foreign‑owned factories for employee transport. Shortly thereafter two more similar buses appeared. Plainclothes Japanese military police, accompanied by a Chinese individual, boarded one bus and charged a fare of six cents per passenger, whereas the Japanese‑owned China Central Metropolitan Bus Company charges ten cents for the same route. Investigation reveals that these buses have no operating license but have been “tacitly permitted” by the Public Concession Police Division’s Huishan Precinct to operate within its jurisdiction. Because the drivers are Westerners, the sentries along the route assume the operation is legitimate foreign business and allow the buses to pass without inspection. Japanese army and navy authorities now take a severe view of this matter and have announced that any public buses carrying Chinese passengers will be subject to inspection.</p>
<h3>Bailianjing Area Unsettled; Ferries Turned Back; All Ferry Landings Sealed</h3>
<p>Except for the ferries at Zhoujiadu and South Bund, which continue to operate normally, the Bailianjing Six‑Mile Bridge ferry, recently resumed service, was repeatedly turned back by military personnel on the morning of the 23rd when attempting to depart the Concession. It is reported that the Bailianjing Six‑Mile Bridge area remains highly unsettled, with all ferry landings sealed and operations halted, making crossings difficult. At the ferry landings at Zhoujiadu, South Bund, and the main dock, security has been tightened and passengers are subject to strict inspections.</p>
<p>Imitation Water Patrol Training School May Collapse</p>
<p>The Water Patrol Training School organized by the Collaborationist Reorganizing Government’s Pacification Ministry, located within the Nantang Jiangnan Shipyard, had been actively recruiting cadets and was scheduled to open on the 1st of next month. However, on the night of the 22nd it was attacked by a team in plain clothes, resulting in the deaths of the collaborationist drill officers and several collaborationist policemen. By the time Japanese military police arrived, the assailants had vanished. It is now widely believed that this blow may cause the collapse of the training school.</p>
<p>Guo Bridge Ambush Kills Japanese Second Lieutenant</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 22nd, a Japanese military patrol set out from Beiqiao along the Shanghai–Minhang Road and, near Tsüanqiao, was suddenly ambushed by guerrillas lying in wait in the fields. The Japanese troops panicked, abandoned their weapons, and fled. Three Japanese soldiers were killed in the engagement, including Second Lieutenant Otani.</p>
<h3>Collaborationist Envoys to Japan to Return to Shanghai Tomorrow; Rumors Say Chu Xiao’an and Gao Guangwu Are Also on Their Way; Collaborationist Authorities Preparing Precautions</h3>
<p>The so‑called “Shanghai Mayor” collaborator Chu Xiao’an and “Nanjing Mayor” collaborator Gao Guangwu departed for Japan aboard the Japanese liner Nagasaki Maru on the 28th of last month to attend the so‑called “East Asian Cities Conference” and report on collaborationist political affairs. Their absence has now reached over twenty days. It is reported that they have boarded the Japanese liner Shanghai Maru for the return voyage from Tokyo to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive tomorrow at 2 p.m. Collaborationist authorities are preparing security measures to guard against any incident. It is widely rumored that the two “mayors” will swap posts next month, with Gao taking up the Shanghai position, while other collaborator appointments are expected to be finalized by month’s end.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association Informs Members to Stand Firm to Prevent Divide‑and‑Rule, So as to Avoid Being Defeated One by One</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association issued a circular to all member firms yesterday, stating that the collaborationist authorities, coveting the fresh pork trade, have established a “Livestock Market” in Hongkou in an attempt to monopolize the business. Although this represents an unprecedented crisis for our industry, the Association, as leader of the trade, must redouble its efforts. It is currently devising strategies to counter this threat, but unity is essential to repel the aggressors. All members must remain steadfast, regardless of any violence or sacrifices, to secure final victory. On the 17th of this month, the Association issued a detailed statement of its position, and in order to prevent any divisive actions, this supplementary circular is issued. We trust that all members will unite, share the same purpose, and weather this storm together, and not be swayed by any entreaties to avoid being defeated in detail.</p>
<h3>Situation in Northern Jiangsu Favorable; Chinese Forces’ Fierce Attack at Rugao; Suburban Strongholds Recaptured One After Another; Haimen’s Third Factory Briefly Attacked</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese military unit under General Chen Caifu launched its counteroffensive in the Dailuoqi and Haichong areas of northern Jiangsu, the situation has become tense. In recent days, many residents from Haimen, Qidong, and Rugao have fled to Shanghai. According to passengers arriving in Shanghai yesterday from Rugao, Rugao County Town is now completely encircled by Chinese forces, who have occupied all major suburban strongholds and are aggressively pushing against the city walls. The Japanese garrison, reliant on the city defenses, is said to be in a state of panic. The Tongru Highway has been damaged and is impassable to motor traffic. At Haimen’s city defenses in the north of Jiangsu, once guerrilla forces reclaimed the area, they renewed a fierce blood fight against the Japanese at the Third Factory. Shipping sources report that on the 21st Chinese troops briefly assaulted the Third Factory but withdrew after Japanese reinforcements arrived and their objectives were met. The two sides remain in standoff. In the suburbs of Qidong City, fighting has occurred for several consecutive days. Shipping between Shanghai and Beisha ports has plummeted due to the conflict, leaving companies operating at a loss and suspending services, resulting in a complete halt in operations.</p>

<h3>Five Members of Japanese Marine Corps at Yangjing Attempt to Avoid Combat, Flee Before Reinforcements Arrive, Abandoning Helmets and Rifles</h3>
<p>The Fourth Battalion of the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces stationed in the Yangjing district of Pudong recently received orders to dispatch a company from the Tianzhang Paper Mill in Lujiazui to the front lines three days ago, scheduled to depart at 2 p.m. However, that morning five soldiers deserted en masse, only discovered missing at roll call, leaving behind their helmets and rifles. A search party was dispatched, and two were apprehended in the rural area outside Pudong Avenue, but three remain unaccounted for. The company did not depart until 8 p.m., by which time the two captured soldiers were sent to Hongkou, and the whereabouts of the remaining three are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang–Jiangxi Line Shortened Compared to Before; Operation Schedule Reduced to Two Runs Daily</h3>
<p>Despite Nanchang becoming a guerrilla-held area, the Zhejiang–Jiangxi Railway remains operational to maintain transport to Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong. However, the section near Nanchang is effectively impassable, so the route has been shortened, terminating at Jinhua in Zhejiang Province and at Guixi in Jiangxi Province. For travel from Jiangxi to Hunan or Guangdong, a new route established by Jiangxi Province is now in use. Consequently, most rolling stock has been redirected from the Zhejiang–Jiangxi line to the Hunan–Guangxi line. Passenger services on the Zhejiang–Jiangxi route have been reduced from four to two daily trips.</p>
<h3>Post Office Announces Suspension of Parcel Shipments North of Jinan</h3>
<p>After resuming acceptance of large and small parcels to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, Shanghai’s Post and Telecommunications Administration has been overwhelmed by the volume of shipments, resulting in packaging rooms piled high. To clear the backlog, the Administration has issued a notice suspending the acceptance of parcels and heavy packages destined for Jinan and the areas of Shandong Province north of Jinan. The notice states that, effective immediately, all parcels and heavy packages addressed to Jinan or any locations in Shandong Province north of Jinan will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Reports of Wang Jingwei’s Apostate Allies Planning to Establish a “Republic News Agency” to Disseminate Poisonous Propaganda and Seduce the Public; Chinese People Aware of Their Concealed Intents and Will Not Fall For It</h3>
<p>Since Wang Jingwei’s defection and betrayal of the nation, there has been widespread outrage across the country, with petitions to the Central Government demanding severe punishment. Refusing to repent, Wang and his cohorts have recently arrived covertly in Shanghai and taken refuge on Dixiwei Road in Hongkou. They intend to collaborate with the puppet “Central China Reformation Government” to realize their puppet regime’s dreams, and have resumed activities in the press, planning to establish the Far East Daily. They have also been organizing a “Republic News Agency” to spread poisonous news and narcotize the public mind. However, the Chinese people are fully aware of their duplicitous intentions and will not be ensnared. Their efforts amount only to the fruitless toiling of traitors’ minds. (Modern News)</p>
<h3>Xujiahui Observatory (1)</h3>
<p>—by Tang Minghe</p>
<p>(1) Establishment</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory was founded sixty-five years ago. It is the earliest modern scientific observatory in the Far East. Why call it “modern scientific”? Because as early as the seventeenth century, in Beijing, Jesuit missionaries such as Matteo Ricci, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, and Ferdinand Verbiest had introduced Western mathematics and astronomy to China. In the late Ming and early Qing eras, an observatory was established in our ancient capital. Those who have visited the Beijing Palace Museum may still recall the instruments on display there.</p>
<p>In the late nineteenth century, as Shanghai’s treaty port began to flourish and foreign shipping increased, these vessels were often destroyed by typhoons. East Asian typhoons had wreaked much devastation, and in recent years continued to menace the region, as seen in the great calamity in the Philippines. At that time, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Catholic priest Deehevreus to establish an observatory to forecast typhoons.</p>
<p>The priest agreed, but stipulated that the observatory must transmit telegraphic reports freely, since an observatory must exchange meteorological data with others. The proposal was approved by the telegraph authorities, and in 1873 the Far East’s first modern observatory was founded in Xujiahui, Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) Development of Meteorological Forecasting</p>
<p>The primary work of the Xujiahui Observatory has been meteorological reporting, which has provided significant contributions to the maritime community. It maintains close contact with over fifty meteorological stations (some in the Pacific Ocean, some at Chinese coastal customs posts, some at inland government stations, and others abroad), as well as commercial and naval vessels at sea. Each day it receives over two hundred weather reports from various locations and broadcasts its own four times daily.</p>
<p>When a typhoon approaches Shanghai, the observatory dispatches a priest to the signal tower on the Bund outside the French Concession to await inquiries from ship captains. When the typhoon arrives, the warning sirens on the Bund can be heard. In recent years, warnings have been transmitted by wireless telegraph, reducing reliance on wired telegraph.</p>
<p>Over the past fifty to sixty years, at least fourteen hundred typhoons have been recorded along the Chinese coast, and thanks to Xujiahui’s warnings, countless ships have been spared disaster. Naval vessels, shipping companies, and mariners have all expressed their gratitude to the observatory. If you visit the Xujiahui Observatory and enter the building, you will see a photograph of the British warship H.M.S. Kent hanging on the wall, with a note of thanks from the ship’s captain in the corner. That is only one of many commendatory items displayed there. Because the reporter paid special attention to that photo and read the inscription aloud, it is cited here as an example.</p>
<p>Standard Time</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory also performs the work of calculating standard time and broadcasting it by wireless telegraph. Time can be determined with an accuracy of one hundredth of a second. Transmissions occur daily at noon and at 9 p.m., allowing ships in the harbor to correct their chronometers.</p>
<p>The observatory now houses two new astronomical clocks in a temperature- and pressure-controlled vault; their daily error does not exceed one hundredth of a second. In addition to timekeeping and broadcasting, they are used for research. In 1926 the International Astronomical Union designated three locations on Earth to serve as standard time reference stations. Xujiahui Observatory is one of them, along with Algiers in Africa and San Diego, California in the United States, and has been in operation since October 1926.</p>
<p>Xujiahui was also the earliest center for geomagnetic research in East Asia, due to the presence of naval facilities in Shanghai. In 1877, instruments were moved to Cajabachang for magnetic observations. Over the past fifty to sixty years, detailed records of geomagnetic variations have been kept. In 1922 the Chinese government instructed Customs and Japanese scientists to jointly survey coastal geomagnetic conditions, utilizing instruments and technicians largely supplied by the Cajabachang Geophysical Department.</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory is also equipped with seismological instruments. Although these were installed later than the others, they are highly sophisticated. There is one Wiechert horizontal seismograph and one Galitzin vertical seismograph. Thus, Xujiahui holds a vital position in global earthquake research. Over the past ten years, the most important records have been the two major earthquakes in North China.</p>
<h3>Balanced Fund Steering Committee Established　Legal Currency Value Increasingly Stable　International Trade Improving with Ample Cash Reserves　Replenished Foreign Exchange Fund Strengthens Wartime Effort</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance secured a loan of ten million pounds from the four banks—British HSBC, Mercantile Bank of India, China &amp; Japan, and Bank of Communications—it organized the Balanced Fund Steering Committee. The legal currency’s value has become more stable; the foreign exchange fund is increasingly well supplied; the entire financial system is more secure; the war effort is strengthened; and international trade with China is being favorably impacted. Public sentiment is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Careful Legal Currency Issuance Policy</p>
<p>The legal currency issuance policies of the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank have been especially cautious. The issuance volume in June of the 26th year stood at 1,007 million yuan, and in June of the 27th year at 1,727 million yuan, an increase of 300 million yuan. Some assert this as proof of inflation. In fact, after the war’s center shifted inland, provinces such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan adopted the legal currency; commercial credit contracted, prompting direct cash transactions. Counterfeit money flooded occupied areas, intensifying hoarding of legal tender. Disruptions in supply and demand drove prices upward, necessitating additional cash for transactions. These factors all justified the increase in issuance. In Shanghai, contraction of currency manifested in high remittance discounts. Therefore, the government has never overissued legal tender, enabling it to maintain its value.</p>
<p>Popular Support and Ample Reserves</p>
<p>Since implementation of the legal currency policy, the people have unanimously expressed support. The ups and downs of the legal currency directly affect personal wealth, arousing strong emotions. Except for a tiny number of unscrupulous speculators, everyone wishes for a solid monetary foundation, seeing benefit for both country and self. Exchanging legal currency for foreign exchange is deemed shameful. Cash reserves of legal tender have remained above sixty percent at all times. Our nation’s US dollar holdings in the United States, as of the end of last June, are estimated at 84 million dollars; this serves as our foreign exchange reserve, stabilizing the value of the legal currency around current exchange rates, preventing wild fluctuations. Domestically, roughly half of remaining silver reserves can still be mobilized, enabling issuance of an additional 200 million yuan of legal currency, while maintaining current exchange rates for over two years.</p>
<p>Effective Management and Improved Trade</p>
<p>After the Central Bank began overseeing foreign exchange approvals, it supplied legitimate commercial needs to the fullest, denying applications from speculators. Channels for capital flight have been closed. Export proceeds in foreign exchange are sold to government banks at legal rates. Imports of foreign goods have declined amid rising prices, benefiting our country’s balance of payments. The government has vigorously promoted wartime thrift; for several months, a trade surplus has even appeared. Overseas Chinese, in patriotic fervor, have sent increasing remittances, preventing sharp shifts in the international balance of payments. Though indirect, these measures robustly support the value of legal currency.</p>
<p>Cooperation of Domestic and Foreign Banks in Preservation</p>
<p>During the war, our banking sector’s assistance to the government in stabilizing finance is undisputed. Allied banks have likewise collaborated to uphold foreign exchange. Whenever foreign exchange markets wavered, domestic and foreign banks led by example, dumping large quantities of foreign currency, which restored stability to legal currency values. Last October, when Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another, the legal currency exchange market remained entirely unaffected. On the contrary, funds that had fled to Hong Kong began flowing back to Shanghai, causing the legal currency to appreciate. This thwarted the Japanese puppet authorities’ numerous attempts to undermine the currency. Within occupied areas, the legal tender continues to circulate, its value surpassing that of counterfeit bills.</p>
<h3>Reception for French Envoy Gossmer by the French Community</h3>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily of the 23rd, a tea reception was held last evening (the 22nd) at the French General Association to honor the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Gossmer. Attended by many guests, they were received by the Association’s chairman, Lawyer Dashang. Speeches were made on all sides, exchanging mutual respects. Ambassador Gossmer’s address earnestly urged unity among the French community in Shanghai to endure these difficult times. He stated that, though he had previously served while residing chiefly in Peking and was not yet familiar with Shanghai, he greatly admired the work of the French community here. It was also reported that at last night’s tea reception, the French Consul General Baudais, due to other commitments, was absent.</p>
<h3>French Concession Authorities Allow Expansion of Factory Zones to Pijiahuizhi Road but Ban Night Operations; Manufacturers Petition Electricity Company for Rate Reductions</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities, seeing factories from the war zone moving into the Concession to resume operations, designated more remote thoroughfares—Kangdi Road, Xuehuali Road, Fuliuli Road, South Jinshenzufu Road, Yalbei Road, Ladu Road, and others—as factory zones. After the war, commercial development became irregular: old factories gradually increased and new ones were added, causing original factory areas to become cramped. Factory owners jointly requested relaxation of restrictions from the Concession authorities to maintain industrial development. This request has been granted, extending factory zones westward to Xujiahui, Qiqi Road, Betang Road, north of Jinjqiao Bridge, and along Xujiahui Road. Factories using electric machinery are permitted to set up there; handcraft workshops not using electric machines remain unrestricted.</p>
<p>Residential Zones Ban Night Operations</p>
<p>Since the newly authorized factory zones fall within predominantly residential areas where many non-Chinese reside, the authorities have ruled that factories established in the Xujiahui area may not operate at night, to avoid noise. Both the National Products United Association of the French Concession and the Chinese Merchants’ Association petitioned for concessions, but no amendments could be made.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Seek Electricity Rate Cuts</p>
<p>Recently, the French-owned Water and Power Company abruptly increased electricity rates by 25 percent, severely burdening factories. Factory owners have verbally requested rate reductions but received no reply. They have now formally asked national product associations to negotiate with the company to rescind the increase. We ourselves will likewise petition the company to lower the proposed hike to sustain industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting through the Ages Replaces Works; Closes Tomorrow at Six</h3>
<p>The exhibition of Chinese calligraphy and painting through the ages, held on the fourth floor of Daxin, was organized to raise funds for medical relief. Thanks to enthusiastic contributions from major Shanghai collectors, over three hundred priceless works were gathered. Due to space constraints, not all could be displayed at once. Two rotations have already occurred, but many pieces remain. To satisfy art lovers, a third rotation will begin today, replacing most previously displayed works and fully exhibiting the remaining 120-plus pieces. Among them: Mr. Cao Youqing’s Song Dynasty “Xisai Fishing Villa Paired Poems”; Mr. Wu Hufan’s Ming Dynasty Tang Yin’s “Burning Incense in Silent Contemplation”; Wen Zhengming’s “Tiger Mountain Bridge”; Qiu Shizhou’s “Gate of Eternal Spring”; Qing Emperor Yuntian’s “Green-and-Blue Landscape”; Mr. Li Bake’s Ming Shen Shitian landscape; Mr. Xu Junqing’s Ming Lu Zhi’s “White-Headed Wren”; Mr. Pu Xiyuan’s Ming Yang Wenzu’s “High Escapist at Mountain Villa”; Mr. Ding Huikang’s Ming Liu Wan’an’s “Green Peaks and Curled Branches”; Dong Qichang’s “Scenes at She Mountain”; Qing Shi Xishang Ren’s “Sound of Springs and Pine Rhythms”; “Feimeng” host’s Qing Mi Bijiang couple’s collaborative flower paintings; Mr. Liu Haisu’s Qing Shi Daoji’s “Pure Fragrance Together Brushed”; “Plum Clear Pine” and others; Mr. Peng Gongfu’s Cha Shibiao landscape album; Mr. Wang Jiquan’s Qing Wang Hui’s imitation of Juran landscape scroll; Mr. Sun Bangrui’s Qing Tang Yusheng’s “Dai Chunshi Landscape Scroll”—all masterworks of their authors. For those seeking an abundant display of Ming and Qing art, this rotation is the richest. The exhibition will close tomorrow at 6 p.m., making today and tomorrow the final opportunity.</p>
<h3>Yingkou and Ningbo Associations to Procure Imported Rice to Aid Hometown; First Batch of 50,000 Dan Sold at 2 Yuan Loss per Dan</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Overseas-Residents Association in Shanghai, to relieve rice shortages for their native towns, has decided to purchase 100,000 dan of Saigon rice, first procuring 50,000 dan to ship to Ningbo for relief. Based on current foreign exchange rates, they will incur a loss of 2 yuan per dan; this deficit will be subsidized jointly by Shanghai and Ningbo parties.</p>

<h3>Adopted Son’s Wretched Ways; Sues Foster Mother for Embezzlement after Squandering Money—Dispute Resolved, Repentance Repeated</h3>
<p>At No. 509 Metcalfe Road, in the Shunkang South Trading Store established by fund collection during his lifetime by Ningbo native Chen Yongkang, Chen’s wife Ms. Hu bore no children. In earlier years the couple adopted a son named Nanshan, now twenty years old. He has spent his life wasting money and consorting with disreputable associates.</p>
<p>Gambling and Dancing</p>
<p>His chief pleasures, after his father’s passing, grew ever more debauched. Once his funds were exhausted, he first surreptitiously took money from the household. When his mother prevented further theft by strict watch, he turned to stealing cash from the Tonghe Trading Company, where he worked. He was discovered and fired, then expelled by his mother. Soon Nanshan begged relatives to mediate, professed repentance, submitted a written apology to his mother, and was allowed home as if once again store proprietor. Yet his innate vice being inborn, once well fed he relapsed into old habits and chose to wander.</p>
<p>Suing Mother for Alimony</p>
<p>At a winter session, he filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against his foster mother Ms. Hu, seeking division of the inheritance (i.e., Shunkang South Trading Store). During pretrial inquiries, since the plaintiff was under the age of legal majority, lacking legal capacity to sue, the case was not decided on its merits; the court merely advised both sides to settle privately. On the 11th of this month, Chen Nanshan suddenly turned himself in at the Gordon Road police station, accusing his mother Ms. Hu of continuing to misappropriate part of a 5,000-yuan inheritance (again referring to the trading store) since his father’s death in the 23rd year of the Republic. The local sub-prefect assigned Chinese and Western detectives to investigate; they found the store operations intact, all property in Ms. Hu’s control; and that she would not allow her son to eat or sleep at the store, letting him roam freely. Relying on the complainant’s statement, the public prosecutor brought charges of “misappropriation of inheritance” against Ms. Hu. A summons was issued. Yesterday morning the defendant appeared before Division Eight, where Procurator Zhong Qing examined the case. After police attorney Zhang Shizhu presented the facts, during which Chen Nanshan testified that he was unemployed and had nowhere to live, lodging at Baoyu Li in Dongxinqiao, and now demanded to return to his mother’s home. He added that last year in his civil case he had made the same request but was not admitted by the defendant; at that time Magistrate Xu even ordered his arrest, which he reported to the station. Upon questioning, Ms. Hu recounted her son’s past misbehavior; her defense attorney Li Gengxiang produced Nanshan’s repentance letter, civil court verdict, and store account ledgers. After mutual debate, Magistrate Zhong acquitted Ms. Hu.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Assault at Cigarette and Tobacco Shop; Three Thieves Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>Shibulin (30), a Jiangbei barber who recently lost his livelihood, conspired with fellow countrymen Wang Guisheng and Yang Chunlin. On the evening of the thirteenth, at 7:45 p.m., they armed themselves with a water pipe repurposed as a pistol and stormed into the Yongshengxiang Cigarette Shop at No. 280 Yanshan Road. They struck proprietor Yuan Jinbo on the head with the pipe, causing him to fall in agony. Seizing the opportunity, the trio snatched over one hundred yuan worth of cigarettes and legal tender, then fled. Pursuit by Chinese detectives Lu Yisheng and Liu Changgen of Yangshupu police station, in conjunction with Wangshipu station’s Huatian substation, led to the arrest of Shi, Wang, and Yang near Nos. 10 Yanshan Road and Qiqihar Road in Funning Road. They were brought to the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, under Magistrate Jiang Shuzi in Division Three, station counsel Zhang Tianyin charged them, invoking Articles 228 and 229 of the Criminal Code for armed robbery in concert and seeking severe punishment. The defendants pled guilty but requested leniency. Magistrate Jiang sentenced Shi Bulin to five years’ imprisonment; Wang Guisheng and Yang Chunlin each received two years and six months, as a deterrent.</p>
<h3>Concealing a Pistol, Turned Over to Police—Robbery Charge Actually a Dispute; Awaiting Witness Testimony</h3>
<p>Zhang Ruquan, from Xuzhou, was arrested by Putuo Road police station and delivered to the First Special District Court after being found early on the 6th at 3:30 a.m. carrying a revolver without ammunition, bearing the old stamp of the municipal Public Security Bureau. He was accused of robbing the property of Ma Eryan Chenglong, resident of No. 137 Xiaoda Road, Jiangbei. Zhang initially confessed, was remanded, and yesterday morning was brought before Division Three. Station counsel Zhang Tianyin stated that in pretrial detention, the defendant denied committing robbery, claiming the matter arose from a gambling quarrel. Both alleged victims failed to appear in court today; thus the charges of robbery and illegal possession of a firearm cannot be adjudicated. Zhang testified he had known Ma for years; they sold fish near the Concession’s large clock. On that occasion he was gambling at Ma’s house; the pistol he carried unloaded was found on a battlefield, he claimed. The court rescheduled for the 27th to summon the Yans and Ma Eryan and further investigate. The defendant remains detained.</p>
<h3>Gamblers Taken from Den; Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>At the Dongzhen Deji gambling den in West Shanghai, authorities of the Concession, acting on tip-offs about stolen goods, searched the premises with Japanese officials, seizing a pistol and, by informant identification, detained eight tea servers and other staff. More than several days have passed since their arrest; the den’s operators have reportedly approached Japanese authorities seeking their release, to no avail. The current location of the eight detainees is unknown.</p>
<h3>Puppet “Police Bureau” Demands Housing Tax</h3>
<p>The city’s puppet “Police Bureau” has for days dispatched large numbers of puppet policemen to homes inside and outside the old city walls, forcibly collecting housing taxes: an estimated 5 yuan per three-story building, 3.50 yuan for a single foreign-style house (storefront), 2 yuan for a single-story house. Those failing to pay after three levies are detained at the “Police Bureau” until paid. Since most residents inside and outside the old city walls lack real estate and are laborers, many have been arrested for nonpayment. Unoccupied houses are sealed by the puppet police.</p>
<h3>Evacuate Concessions Promptly or Face Death Without Compensation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the puppet “Shanghai Municipality” issued two “secret orders,” respectively delivered to various puppet “departments and subordinate organizations,” ordering all puppet officials to evacuate the foreign concessions promptly, declaring that it “will bear no responsibility for relief.” After the puppet Foreign Minister Chen Lu was assassinated, a similarly worded “secret order” was issued; this second puppet “order” indicates that puppet personnel do not take the puppet “municipal government” seriously.</p>
<h3>Factory Owner’s Wife Caught in Adultery Twice; Husband Seeks Divorce; Court Grants Divorce in Part, She Appeals, Husband Seeks Dismissal</h3>
<p>Modern lady Zhao Lianying is the wife of Ningbo native Zheng Yanling, owner of the Weishun Knitting Factory on Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. After ten years of marriage, they have been before the court more than ten times. Lianying, now thirty and charming, soon after marriage committed adultery with her brother-in-law. Her husband discovered this, and she voluntarily wrote a repentance letter. Zheng, concerned about his reputation, did not pursue the matter. Unexpectedly, her licentious nature persisted, and she later engaged in an inappropriate affair with a factory employee. In May of last year, Zheng again discovered her misconduct; she asked to write another repentance letter, which he permitted, hoping for marital harmony. Nevertheless, Lianying continued secret rendezvous at inns with her lover. In the autumn, Zheng, with no alternative, reported her to the Concession police, and she was brought before the Second Court and sentenced to four months’ imprisonment. Her appeal was denied, and the verdict became final. Because of her continued amorous indulgence with no sign of remorse, Zheng filed for divorce in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court. The initial trial granted the divorce, but Lianying, dissatisfied, appealed to the Third Branch Court. Yesterday, presided over by Chief Judge Xia with magistrates and clerks in the Third Court, both parties were summoned. Appellant Zhao Lianying testified that she did not deny repeatedly committing adultery nor denies having given two repentance letters and serving a criminal sentence. She argued that, having been forgiven by her husband via repentance letters, under the law adultery no longer constitutes grounds for divorce; moreover, Zheng’s domicile in Ningbo, not Shanghai, meant the divorce should have been filed in Ningbo court; the original trial ignored jurisdiction, rendering the verdict illegal, and should be overturned. Respondent Zheng Yanling testified that although his registered residence is Ningbo, he has resided in Shanghai for many years operating the factory and regards Shanghai as his permanent domicile; the trial magistrate’s decision to grant divorce conforms with law; Lianying’s repeated adultery, which she admits, naturally precludes lifelong marital unity. He requested the court to dismiss the appeal and uphold the original verdict. After oral arguments, the court adjourned debate and concluded the hearing, scheduling judgment for April 26.</p>
<h3>“Lieutenant Xu” Betrays and Surrenders, Illegally Arrests Innocent Villagers, Seizes Large Stockpile of Arms</h3>
<p>Xu Fugui, a Shandong native, formerly served as a company commander in the Tax Police Regiment during Shanghai’s wartime. After the National Army withdrew west, Xu and several dozen soldiers stayed in the countryside west of Shanghai. Last year Xu led his men to join the Zhejiang-Jiangsu Action Committee’s Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, commanding the Sixth Battalion under Jin Fuxiang as second company commander and deputy battalion adjutant, earning him the nickname “Lieutenant Xu.” Recently, stirred by a certain collaborator, Xu, succumbing to greed, defected midstream and joined the West Shanghai Garrison under Japanese Captain Sakei, serving as chief warrant officer. Currently stationed in Caohejing Township near Jiangsu Second Prison, he and his dressed-as-civilians Japanese-Chinese troops have conducted dragnet searches for guerrilla forces in West Shanghai, arresting innocent villagers indiscriminately. Unable to endure this harassment, villagers last night (the 21st) around 9 p.m. Xu, with his civilian-clad Japanese-Chinese forces, went to the Catholic Church at the eastern end of Qibao Township, arresting 23-year-old Songjiang native Zhou Yueming, a performer of boat-people lyrical tunes, and nineteen-year-old Wu Fengying (aka Ada), granddaughter of Wu Youshan and daughter of milk-seller Hu Ki Yu in front of Zhenqian in Xujiahui Township. They also seized a pistol from the Wu family. Later, they searched a certain surname Qiao’s hall and unearthed more than forty rifles and two boxes of ammunition, reportedly arms buried by the Sixth Battalion’s Jin Unit. Verification is pending.</p>
<h3>Japanese-Puppet Forces Unearth Hidden Weapons</h3>
<p>At Caohejing Township in West Shanghai, Japanese authorities, having bribed ruffians disguised as soldiers to track guerrilla activity, have left signs of puppet personnel all around the township. Led by the puppet police commandant stationed in the prison, they first excavated previously hidden arms. Yesterday morning, puppet forces and puppet police unearthed over thirty rifles and pistols. Reports say that in recent days Japanese-puppet forces have captured a considerable quantity of weapons.</p>
<h3>Attempted Rape of Young Woman; Defendant Denies Rape</h3>
<p>Jiang Laixiang, daughter of Jiang Liankui from Nantong, nineteen, was to be introduced to a prospective suitor this February. In early March, her cousin Lu was entrusted to bring her to Shanghai, to stay with relatives and procure trousseau fabrics and furnishings. En route, Lu handed her off to countryman Qian Haihai, who failed to deliver her to her relatives and instead took her to his home on Kennaihai Road and raped her. Her brother Jiang Hukuan in Shanghai learned of this and reported to the police, who sent detectives to Yong’an Street to arrest Qian Haihai, rescue Jiang and return her to her brother. Meanwhile Qian was sent to the Second Special Court, charged with violating the family. During multiple hearings, he flatly denied having relations with the girl and was remanded for further investigation. As previously reported, yesterday afternoon at the resumed hearing, only the plaintiffs Jiang Hukuan and his sister Laixiang appeared; Qian Haihai again denied the rape, testifying that he had met the girl years ago at the Concession near the big clock selling fish. He claimed they lodged at the port hostelry one night, then took the ferry to Shanghai; the girl refused to stay with her aunt and temporarily stayed at his house; later Lu came to Shanghai and rented a house with him, and the girl stayed with Lu, having nothing to do with him; they needed Lu to appear in court to clarify the matter, and so forth. Upon questioning, the girl admitted that Lu entrusted Qian to bring her to Shanghai. The court adjourned to the 27th to subpoena and reexamine, and Qian remains in custody.</p>
<h3>Factory Worker Severely Scalded</h3>
<p>Early yesterday at about 5 a.m., factory worker Diao Jinguang, 18, from Anhui, employed at the Dagong Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 1001 Huade Road in Hongkou, accidentally fell into a large cloth-boiling vat. He was immediately scalded and cried for help. Another worker rescued him, but he sustained severe burns all over his body. An ambulance was summoned, and he was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Reports say his life may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Man Hangs Himself to Death</h3>
<p>Late the night before last, during curfew hours, an unnamed man of about forty, appearing to be a businessman, quietly went to the back gate of No. 86 Garesché Road in the French Concession and hanged himself from an iron bar in a window using a cloth strip. Not until about 5 a.m. yesterday did a sixteen-year-old maid named Cheng, employed at No. 86, open the back door to empty the chamber pot and discover the body. Police were summoned and pronounced him dead. He likely killed himself due to economic pressure. The case was reported to the Xafly Road police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Red Cross funeral parlor’s subsidiary hall for autopsy, awaiting retrieval by the Second Special Court for legal inquest.</p>
<h3>Elderly Man Run Over and Injured by Vehicle</h3>
<p>Chang Tingquan, 58, a Jiangbei resident at No. 6, Lane 87, Jing’an Temple Road, yesterday at 8:20 p.m., while crossing the intersection of Hede and Fuxu roads in West Shanghai, was struck by a speeding military vehicle number 6980. He could not evade in time, was knocked down, and his left leg was run over and severed. He bled profusely and fainted. Nearby police recorded the military plate number and summoned ambulance No. 83, which rushed him to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Low-Pressure Trough Moves Toward Japan; Shanghai Weather Clears Up</h3>
<p>Our city has recently been disrupted by a southern low-pressure trough, causing extremely unsettled weather and unceasing spring rains. Though such patterns often occur in spring, the duration this year has been unusually prolonged. Until the day before yesterday, as Yangtze River basin pressures rose, Shanghai’s weather cleared up, and the low-pressure trough moved on toward Japan, bringing clear skies to our city.</p>
<h3>Kidnapped by Female Bandits in Pudong’s Jinjia Lane and Ransomed</h3>
<p>Jin Xiaoshi, over sixty, a woodworker living in Jinjia Lane, Pudong Township, was abducted by female bandits under the ringleader Jin Fengying. Yesterday he was ransomed for 260 yuan in foreign currency and released. This incident reveals the active state of bandit and puppet forces, making life intolerable for people in occupied areas.</p>
<h3>Dense Defensive Works Along the Zhabei Concession</h3>
<p>In various locations along the Zhabei concession, defensive works have recently been arranged with unusual thoroughness. Whether along the river or at key road junctions, substantial installations are in place. Yesterday afternoon at around 2 o’clock, an observer conducted a special inspection and recorded the following:</p>
<p>At the west end of West Suzhou Road, on the north bank of the New Bridge by the Sampan Factory, there were originally defensive works erected by Chinese troops. These have now been extensively overhauled by Japanese soldiers: dilapidated sandbags and the like have been replaced with gravel and cement mortar, with small firing ports left both above and below for mounting machine guns or light artillery. The positions afford clear views both eastward and westward. Two Japanese soldiers stand guard at the bridgehead, rifles at the ready. On the southern bank toward the concession, the iron gates remain closed and no American troops are present—only a single Chinese constable guards beneath the bridge. On the north bank of the Suzhou River along Guangfu Road, the open ground to the east is piled high with yellow sand and stones. It was reported that because yesterday was Sunday, no one was working; normally transport vehicles arrive continuously to load and carry the materials. Along the riverbank at points such as the Meiyuan Road intersection, Huasheng Road intersection, New Zha Bridge, Chang’an Road intersection, and from Wuzhen Road Bridge to the new Garbage Bridge, dense sand fortifications have been erected. At the Manchuria Road intersection (the corner by Jiangsu Bank), a new cement bunker has recently been built facing the concession. Along Northwest Tibet Road at intersections such as Arabaisi Road, Mongolian Road, the terminus of Northwest Tibet Road, and Xinjiang Road, similar defensive works stand ready. At the Xinjiang Road–Rehe Road junction, yet another new cement bunker has been constructed. Looking west from the Gansu Road–Haining Road intersection, aside from a few sandbag emplacements, the roadway itself has been painted green. On North Zhejiang Road, near the Ai’erjin Road intersection on the Chinese side, entrances at Huaxing Road and North Zhejiang Road are blocked with sandbags. Along the boundary road to Baoshan Road, aside from the fort at the Baoshan Road intersection—which was long ago completed—another new fort has been finished opposite the North Railway Station on Kenenghai Road.</p>

<h3>Overworked Japanese Police: Hongkou District Unsafe, Recent Burglary Rings Rampant</h3>
<p>Within the heavily guarded Japanese area of Hongkou, a series of major thefts has recently occurred, deeply worrying the Japanese authorities. The Japanese Consulate Police Station has mobilized all its officers to intensify investigations. After several days of detective work, at 11 p.m. on the 21st they arrested two specialized tobacco thieves, Qiu Sanbao (34) and Gu Youguang (25). The pair revealed that their accomplices were hiding at No. 1014 Aidoya Road. On the 22nd, Japanese police, together with the detention bureau, raided that address and apprehended Yu Hongzhang (26) and Chen Zaiyou (22). According to Japanese-language newspapers, Qiu and his associates are also suspected of involvement in arson.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Blockade: Charcoal Prices Spike by About One Dime per Basket; Fuel Supplies Unlikely to Run Short</h3>
<p>Charcoal is one of the city’s primary everyday fuels alongside briquettes and white coal. Normally it is gathered from various parts of eastern Zhejiang at ports from Ningbo to Wenzhou and shipped by steamer to Shanghai. Since the Ningbo–Shanghai service was suspended, shipments have continued in steady stream from Wenzhou. Yesterday word reached Shanghai that Wenzhou has imposed a blockade and halted steamers, making supply sources difficult. As a result, charcoal merchants have taken the opportunity to raise market prices by about one dime per basket. However, supplies of white coal remain ample, so fuel shortages are not expected.</p>
<h3>Woolen Suit Industry Staff Mutual Aid Association: Honorary Directors Appointed to Actively Advance Association Affairs</h3>

<h3>Boundary‑Crossing Robbery on Balinan Road: Woman Shot in Chest While Pursuing Thieves Who Fled With Stolen Goods Despite Her Calls for Help</h3>
<p>At No. 23 in the cross‑boundary zone of Balinan Road (near Yidingpan Road), at about 7:15 yesterday evening, while the householders were dining around the table, several thieves suddenly burst in to rob them. The bandits produced firearms and ordered the men and women not to move, forcing them to hand over valuables. After searching for about half an hour, they withdrew to make their escape. But the housewife, Ms. Gu Cui, age 27, unable to bear seeing her possessions stolen, immediately gave chase and cried for help. The thieves, in a panic, turned and fired a shot, which struck her in the chest. She collapsed at once, and the bandits escaped with the loot. Afterwards, her family appealed to the concession authorities for assistance and called for an ambulance, which transported her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. It is understood that the wound is in a critical area and her life hangs in the balance; the loss is considerable.</p>
<h3>Exhibit of Calligraphy and Painting Through the Ages: Reflections After Viewing</h3>
<p>— Zhaoping</p>
<p>— Enough to Arouse National Consciousness —</p>
<p>An exhibition of Chinese calligraphy and painting through the ages was held on the fourth floor of the Daxin Building to support the medical relief movement. I managed to visit twice and encountered many priceless works by masters who have reached the highest pinnacles of the art—works on which millennia have already passed judgment. I need not expound on their artistic merits here. What I wish to discuss are the exhibition’s manifestations of spirit in various respects.</p>
<p>Collectors’ Spirit Manifestation</p>
<p>Chinese collectors have long been prone to hoarding secretly and taking pride in it without sharing their treasures. At this exhibition, however, contributors such as Pang Xuzhai, Pu Xiyuan, Wu Hufan, Liu Haisu, and Ding Huikang—all renowned collectors—loaned works by celebrated masters from the Song dynasty (Su Shi, Huang Tingjian, Mi Fu, Cai Xiang), the four masters of the late Yuan (Huang Gongwang, Wu Zhen, Wang Meng, Ni Zan), the four masters of the Ming (Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, Qiu Ying), and the famous “Four Wangs” of the Qing dynasty—each with masterpieces fully representative of their eras and careers. It was unprecedented in previous calligraphy and painting exhibitions to see such renowned collectors openly offering such famous works. The reason lies entirely in these major collectors’ enthusiasm for public welfare, enabling them to break the old habits and display such openness. I hope all collectors in society will take this exhibition as an example, generously share their treasured collections, and hold public exhibitions. Such actions would be immeasurably meritorious in promoting academic culture and benefiting society.</p>
<p>Artists’ Spirit Manifestation</p>
<p>Individual art reflects the artist’s spirit, and a nation’s art reflects its national spirit. Thus, an artist’s achievements naturally embody not only their personal spirit but also the eternal spirit of the nation. At a time when our country faces crisis, when rivers and mountains are shattered and our valiant soldiers are shedding blood for the final victory, yet on this isolated island many sing and dance in oblivion, living anesthetized lives; and many secretly bend the knee to serve the enemy, tasting the flavor of slavery, nearly extinguishing the national soul. This exhibition, held in such an atmosphere, although primarily aimed at advancing medical relief, carries two profound meanings: first, by presenting works of past masters, it affirms the national soul and awakens us to the heavy responsibility of carrying that soul forward, never again to live in drunken dreams; second, among the works are many by loyal and righteous heroes whose virtues blaze like the sun. It is not merely their achievements that are on display but their characters. When we view the calligraphy of Huang Daozhou of the late Ming or the paintings of Ni Yuanlu, we are reminded of their loyalty, courage, and unyielding integrity, which instantly stirs our spirits and makes us feel that, even if we cannot all become battlefield heroes, we must at least preserve our personal integrity, striving to be people of unwavering principle. Thus, on this isolated island and in a time when the government calls for a nationwide spiritual mobilization, this exhibition not only celebrates the great national spirit but also showcases the greatness of individual moral character—truly providing the spiritual nourishment most needed by those on this island today.</p>
<p>Audience’s Spirit Manifestation</p>
<p>Both times I visited, the exhibition hall was packed. In these hard times when a meal is not easily come by, people still willingly spend money—to appreciate and study such rare artistic works, yes, but fundamentally driven by a desire to contribute to medical relief for compatriots in need. The audience’s enthusiastic response exemplifies this spirit of benevolence and mutual aid. With such spirit, what cannot be achieved?</p>

<h3>Public Medical Service Society: Seeking Members</h3>

All four major national medical organizations in Shanghai have endorsed and sponsored it. With a solid organization and broad scope, we are now recruiting founding members.

<h3>Farewell Banquet by Staff of China Automobile Company for General Manager Fillmore’s Return to the U.S.</h3>
<p>On the night of the 12th, staff of the American China Automobile Company held a banquet at the Great East Restaurant to bid farewell to General Manager Fillmore and his family before their return to the United States. Besides the Fillmores, attendees included Manager W.E. Holland, Sales Department General Manager V.J.B. Holland, Deputy General Manager Ni Yiqing, Chinese Manager Zou Hongsheng, Repair Department Manager R. Cook, and other senior Chinese and foreign staff—over ten in total. Guests included R.T. Bremer, Export Department Manager of Chrysler Factory; C.B. Lucado, representative of the Parts Department; and John R. Kaiser, representative of the Repair Department. During the banquet, toasts were made to Mr. and Mrs. Fillmore. The gathering was splendid and continued until after 9 o’clock.</p>
<p>It is noted that China Automobile Company was founded in 1914, with its manager representing the famous American Dodge Motor Car, known for genuine goods at fair prices and excellent credit. It is said that Mr. Fillmore’s trip carries new plans to fully negotiate with the factory side. He is expected to remain in America for about six months and return to Shanghai around mid‑October, at which time he will likely make fresh contributions to Shanghai’s and other regions’ automobile industries—a prediction worth looking forward to.</p>

<h3>Proceedings of Our Publication’s Second Symposium on Balancing Commodity Prices (Record of the First Session) – Why Are Prices Soaring?</h3>
<p>Date    From 10:00 a.m. on the 16th of this month</p>
<p>Location    Conference Hall, Fifth Floor, Shen Bao</p>
<p>Attendees    Cheng Shaode; Zhang Sumin; Yu Dingyi; Wang Haibo; Zhang Mumin; Nie Guangdi; Wang Yutong; Zhu Sihuang; Wei Youqi; Wang Fuli; Shi Huikang; Zhang Wuyun; Zhao Jianzi; Shen Zhenyi; Zhang Yifan (Li); Xu Dingchen (Li); Wu Guanzhou (Li); Li Quanshi; Liu Xingchen; Pan Yangyao; Sun Liyu</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan: I am deeply honored that you gentlemen have sacrificed your rest time to attend our paper’s symposium on the issue of commodity prices. With prices soaring so dramatically, the problem no longer concerns only consumers feeling the strain—producers feel the pressure too. It affects not just the livelihoods of our people but also the fate of the entire national economy and our wartime economy. Our citizens, for the sake of the country, are willing to endure any sacrifice. Yet within reason, we must strive to minimize waste of our nation’s economic strength. The central government has already resolved to implement plans to stabilize domestic prices; but Shanghai’s situation is unique. Apart from each private sector assuming its wartime duty and jointly undertaking price‑stabilization work, we seem left only with watching prices continue to rise. In wartime Shanghai, though its economic position has fallen somewhat from pre‑war levels, its influence over the country’s economy remains formidable. We can see from many facts that Shanghai’s prices govern those in the interior—cotton yarn is one example. Shanghai’s special circumstances render central policy less effective. Up to now, the private sector’s response to high prices has been purely passive endurance. Though admirable in spirit, it is too passive and ultimately too dangerous for the future. Thus, from the standpoint of our citizens and of the academic community, we must devise and promote solutions. That is why our paper has so earnestly centered this symposium on the issue of price stabilization. We believe that in today’s Shanghai, to balance prices we need the concerted effort of all industries—only then can we achieve anything. In drawing up our invitation list, we gave this much thought. Each of you is an expert who has conducted specialized research on various industries, on particular goods, and on general pricing. Not only do you all possess rich experience, you also have broad economic learning. In addition, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Zhu Boquan, Mr. Yao Qingsan, Mr. Pan Hengqin, Mr. Liu Tiesun, Mr. Xie Juzeng, Mr. Zhu Gengxin, and several others, though unable to attend today due to other engagements, have submitted written opinions, for which we are deeply grateful. Now, I invite each gentleman to take the pulse of our prices:</p>
<p>Wei Youqi: I believe today’s domestic price surge can be observed from two angles. In urban areas—namely the treaty ports—transportation remains largely unobstructed, so material allocation is comparatively easy, unlike in the interior. The causes of rising urban prices are: (1) the black‑market exchange rate has depreciated, and since most urban goods relate to foreign exchange, this invisibly drives up prices; (2) inland transport is cut off, so local produce cannot flow freely into Shanghai; (3) other factors, such as increases in certain weaving‑duty surcharges, also play a role. As for the interior’s price surge, it is mostly due to insufficient supplies and maladjusted distribution—other causal factors are relatively minor. Wartime price rises, whether or not beneficial to daily life, arguably create a favorable environment for domestic industrial development. Regarding price balancing, in Shanghai it seems not yet feasible; in the interior the focus must be on economizing and expanding local productive capacity. Private self‑regulatory methods can only involve economizing campaigns—this is indeed what civilians should undertake in wartime.</p>
<p>Zhang Wuyun: Since the war began, prices have continued to rise. Many analysts attribute this entirely to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange; in fact, price increases are not uniform. Rice, for example, has not soared greatly, and cotton yarn fluctuates independently of foreign exchange. In Shanghai there are four primary causes of rising prices: First, reduced production—pre‑war inland cotton‑yarn mills have all shut down, and even in the Yangshupu district only foreign firms are operating. As a result, all regions rely solely on the yarn mills within the Shanghai Concessions, and if transport is unobstructed, yarn prices shoot upward. At one point, a single bale reached 500 yuan; only when river transport was blocked did prices fall. Other manufactured goods show the same trend. Second, diminished supply—cotton cannot arrive in Shanghai from the occupied interior, and massive Japanese purchases further push the price up; the same applies to beef hides, tung oil, and others. Before the war reached Shanghai, rice once surged above 20 yuan per dan due to blocked supply; though government controls proved ineffective, once supply lines reopened last year, wholesale prices hovered around 12 yuan, lower than the controlled price. This shows how supply interruptions relate directly to prices. Third, population changes—since the war, Shanghai has become a refuge for displaced people, greatly expanding consumption of all goods, driving up prices of vegetables, medicines, and so on. Fourth, the emergence of a black‑market for foreign exchange—exchange rates have fallen to about eight pence, so import prices rise, and export goods also climb since exchange conversions become profitable, as with raw silk and cocoons. These four causes together have produced today’s soaring prices. Broadly speaking, foreign‑exchange fluctuations are not the sole driver; the intrinsic supply‑and‑demand dynamics of each good sometimes lie beyond exchange‑rate influence. Overall, reduced production is the greatest single cause of price rises; the others follow in importance.</p>
<p>Cheng Shaode: The impact of currency on Shanghai prices is relatively small because, after the war, Shanghai’s currency supply has not significantly increased; during certain periods it has even contracted, due to the implementation of financial stabilization measures that restrict money shipments to Shanghai. Judging by currency circulation: both the volume of market tokens and their velocity are well below pre‑war levels. Pre‑war, Shanghai Bank bill‑exchange totals reached up to 30 million yuan daily; now the high is only around 10 million. Shanghai prices may not be directly driven by currency supply, but there are two indirect effects: (1) the fall in foreign exchange raises import prices, indirectly lifting domestic prices; (2) increased population coupled with scarce goods—currency and goods out of balance, so prices rise proportionally. Yet this is not solely due to money supply. As for the causes of Shanghai’s price surge: (1) supply controls and shortages; (2) increased transport and handling charges; (3) higher production costs; (4) foreign‑exchange depreciation raising import costs, indirectly affecting some domestic goods; (5) merchant speculation; (6) market psychology. From the experts’ earlier reports on various goods’ price rises, we can condense our conclusions into these points. Remedies rely partly on public opinion campaigns and partly on industry associations’ self‑regulation. Yet they can only curb speculation and market panic; they cannot effectively address the other causes of price increases.</p>
<p>Wang Yutong: Wartime domestic price surges—especially those in Shanghai—stem primarily from abnormal supply and demand. Government controls on foreign exchange have sparked violent black‑market fluctuations, fueling distorted price rises. According to our surveys: (1) Of twenty‑four major agricultural products, twenty‑two have risen in price, most notably green tea, tobacco leaves, tung oil, raw silk, and more recently linseed and soybean oils; (2) Of nine important industrial goods, imports—such as pigments, chemical raw materials, hardware, and paper—have surged most severely, followed by cloth and cotton yarn; (3) Of seven key mineral products, none have escaped rises, especially coal, which has shot up 150 percent, and other rates range from 10 percent to over 150 percent. There are five principal causes, of which the fifth is most striking: (1) transport blockages hindering smooth supply; (2) large quantities of goods stranded in war zones or the interior, creating shortages; (3) production areas destroyed and supplies cut off; (4) government controls on foreign exchange, a shrinking official market, and merchants seizing opportunities for speculation; (5) the recent runaway surges in linseed and soybean oils, where supply authority lies not with us but with others. Rogue elements in the trade have fanned the flames of speculation for profit.</p>
<p>Zhao Jianzi: The earlier analyses of high prices have been very thorough, and I greatly admire them. From an economic perspective, current price surges can be classified into (1) currency causes and (2) commodity causes. According to the quantity‑theory of money, if fiat‑currency issuance doesn’t expand, its value shouldn’t fall. In China, from the introduction of the currency law until the control of foreign exchange, issuance steadily increased yet the currency didn’t depreciate—this reflects the abolition of old notes and their replacement with new currency. Simultaneously, the price index rose—not due to monetary expansion but because of global price increases. Wartime issuance did climb, but this is unrelated to today’s price surges, since Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and even parts of Sichuan adopted the new currency, expanding its circulation area; issuance grew only in step with demand, not due to so‑called inflation. In occupied zones and the interior, many notes were destroyed by shelling. After the war, commercial credit halted and cash transactions resumed, also increasing currency circulation. In sum, post‑war currency issuance rose because of an expanded circulation area, but this cannot be taken as proof that currency expansion caused soaring prices. So where do post‑war price surges come from? As earlier speakers said: commodity supply–demand imbalances, merchant hoarding, transport blockages, delayed shipments, and so on—they all fall under commodity causes. Additionally, I believe taxes and public levies—such as taxation and military‑risk surcharges—have also driven prices upward.</p>
<p>Zhang Sumin: Shanghai’s price rise differs from that of the interior. Domestic goods there have risen due to supply–demand imbalances: raw materials have decreased or inland sources have dried up. Imported goods have climbed because domestic currency has depreciated against foreign exchange. There has been no real currency inflation in Shanghai; the financial authorities have pursued a contractionary policy, as is well known. In the interior, price rises also stem mainly from supply–demand imbalances. Manufactured goods there historically depended on Yangtze‑region factories; after that region’s occupation, supply was cut or transport made difficult, so prices rose. Local staple products don’t necessarily rise in their home region but do rise elsewhere due to transport difficulties. As for imported goods inland, strict government controls have all but ended civilian imports, save for military supplies. Major inland export products—like tea leaves and tung oil—are fully monopolized by the government for export, leaving little for civilian use, so their domestic prices have risen; yet regulated prices are hard to enforce. Because the price problem is complex, controls must be implemented separately by commodity. In Shanghai, aside from rice, which the Concession authorities regulate, other prices are beyond their reach. In the interior, various localities have indeed implemented price controls.</p>
<p>Pan Yangyao: Prices in both the interior and Shanghai have risen over the past two years, with the interior surging more sharply. Causes are: (1) transport difficulties, where freight sometimes costs several times the product’s value; (2) exchange relations—strict Ministry of Finance controls on foreign remittances are necessary to prevent capital flight to occupied areas. Currently, the China–Central–Agricultural Bank limits remittances to 5,000 yuan per branch per day. Thus, when local merchants ship goods inland and remit funds back to Shanghai, not only is the exchange rate over 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan (about 110 yuan on drafts, 160 yuan on telegraphic transfers) but the process is very difficult—raising prices. (3) The interior also imposes trade controls and levies on incoming goods, invisibly pushing prices up. (4) Military aircraft attacks create transport hazards, reducing inland shipments and inviting speculative markups by those risking the journey. (5) Beyond exchange controls, the government has placed many commodities under direct regulation; merchants, finding no profit, avoid trading these, thinning supply and creating upward pressure. (6) Many factories’ raw materials rely on foreign exchange; as the exchange rate falls, their costs rise. In Shanghai, a sudden doubling of population and skewed social developments further complicate price rises. Still, since interior remittances have been restricted, merchants find it unprofitable to send goods inland, and instead bring interior goods out-of-region—this has unintentionally limited further price increases, though the effect is slight.</p>
<p>Nie Guangdi: Many causes underlie post‑war price surges; your broad analyses have been very thorough. I would like to add one point. While supply–demand imbalances are certainly the primary cause, transport blockages and shipment difficulties that hamper cargo delivery also readily spur price rises. Take agricultural products: one region may have abundant output, depressing prices there, while another region, in urgent need and faced with supply obstructions, sees prices skyrocket—but because transport is so difficult, no equilibration occurs between the two regions. High interior exchange costs affect all inland freight costs. For example, Chongqing’s remittance charge to Shanghai is over 100 yuan per 1,000 yuan; when merchants purchase goods in Shanghai to ship to Chongqing, they must add this 10 percent surcharge to their costs, thus raising selling prices. Furthermore, along the route various levies and surcharges, plus insurance for transport and military‑risk fees, accumulate—how can prices not soar? A previous speaker mentioned foreign‑exchange effects; this is indeed a factor, but I think its impact on domestic raw materials is small, and on manufactured products greater; imported foreign goods need not be said. For instance, in many rice‑producing regions, pre‑war rice sold for 7 or 8 yuan per dan and now remains about the same—it has not risen simply because our currency’s foreign‑exchange rate is tighter. By contrast, after the July 7 Incident, cotton prices in the Longhai Railway region collapsed for lack of buyers, yet yarn and cloth from Shanghai and Hankou mills continued climbing. Supply–demand relations are paramount—but mill machinery parts and hardware must be paid for in foreign exchange, so manufactured‑goods costs rise correspondingly. Thus, I believe foreign exchange influences domestic prices chiefly in an indirect manner. Currency effects on prices are significant, as several colleagues noted. Although government issuance of new currency has increased post‑war, market token circulation in Shanghai is not only below pre‑war levels but appears tighter. Yet people, fearing inflation or mistrusting the new notes, have hoarded many goods; merchants have meanwhile stirred speculation for profit, causing many items to rise, as our chairman said—a purely monetary form of price hike. Thus, I think in Shanghai hoarding by outsiders and speculative manipulation by insiders greatly influence many price increases. Regardless of all causes, letting prices run rampant is wrong and seriously affects social stability and common livelihoods. Shanghai, with over 5 million residents, has many latent problems. We should seek a plan to curb these price surges.</p>
<p>Li Quanshi: To balance interior prices, we must resolve transport‑line issues. To balance Shanghai prices, population must be dispersed. Expecting industry associations to self‑regulate is like “negotiating with a tiger.” They are busy profiting from national calamity—who will forego a chance to get rich? Regarding luxury goods, we might as well let their prices rise; when they become too expensive, people naturally economize and prices will fall. In fact, any efforts to artificially balance them are futile.</p>
<p>Zhang Mumin: Stable prices greatly benefit the populace. But political power is indispensable. Since Shanghai cannot wield political authority, cooperation among all parties to implement autonomous regulation is necessary. Yet the core cause of Shanghai’s price surge is speculative manipulation. Regulated by merchants and self‑regulating by merchants, such efforts will have little effect. In truth, we might just let Shanghai’s prices rise naturally, because the concentration of population in Shanghai is itself unreasonable. However, if essential daily‑use goods remain expensive, the economic future of this society is in grave danger.</p>
<p>Wang Haibo: Wartime price surges have many causes. For example: Shanghai’s transport to the interior is cut off—that’s a transport cause; the new currency has fallen to eight pence on the black market—that’s a foreign‑exchange cause; Shanghai’s sudden population rise to 5 million—that’s a population cause; higher freight, insurance, and interest rates—that’s a cost cause; the large demand for military supplies—that’s a military‑needs cause; merchants hoarding for speculation—that’s a manipulation cause; plus factory destructions, shifts in manufacturers and laborers, government controls on goods in occupied zones, myriad levies on transport, and so on. Analyzing these, we can list perhaps twenty causes. Yet by standard economic classification, they fall into three categories: (1) surging demand—including population, military needs, and hoarding; (2) sharply reduced supply—including destroyed factories, halted production, transport blockages, and lost production areas; (3) breakdowns in the medium of exchange—namely, currency value collapses. In peacetime, demand and supply determine prices and can balance each other; but in wartime, demand keeps rising while supply rapidly falls, so the two cannot balance, and prices soar. In this severe situation, a third factor emerges: faults in the exchange process. We know that the medium of exchange and the standard for measuring prices is money. When war causes money to collapse, prices naturally rise. As for which cause is strongest, one cannot generalize—they interact in complex ways. In studying them, we can use three criteria: (1) by commodity category—imports are most hit by foreign‑exchange, interior goods by transport blockages, occupied‑zone goods by levies and controls; (2) by region—Shanghai and the interior differ: Shanghai prices rose quickly, the interior more slowly, even falling in some areas; (3) by time—depending on military events and public psychology: when military fortunes improve, prices stabilize; when fortunes decline, prices change rapidly. Price research requires time and detailed analysis; my observations are naturally shallow. But broadly, I hold that price surges stem from three root causes: (1) surging demand; (2) plunging supply; (3) currency‑value collapse. These three factors ebb and flow with time and commodity. Therefore, in our research we should analyze according to those three standards—by category, by region, and by time—to reach more accurate conclusions.</p>
<p>Zhu Sihuang: We cannot generalize about causes of price rises—differences in region and commodity type are vital. For example, Shanghai prices are inevitably influenced by currency conditions, while special forces or unique causes can also disturb the market. Inland price rises stem mostly from transport blockages, so imported goods cost less in Shanghai than inland, whereas domestic goods cost less inland than in Shanghai. Another important point: in normal times, price stability is maintained by a balance of supply and demand power. When prices fall, demand power dominates; when they rise, supply power does. Now that price rises are under way, the power of suppliers—hoarding, speculation, and manipulation—is the major factor driving prices still higher. Regarding currency, we see how such speculation gains force: normally in inflation, people’s incomes rise, stimulating daily necessities demand and raising prices. China’s wartime currency cannot be said to inflate massively, but the tightening of black‑market exchange does reflect some inflation. Yet Chinese incomes have shrunk with widespread pay cuts, reducing consumption. On one hand, military needs force savings; on the other, inflation encourages hoarding and speculative manipulation. In both goods and financial markets, speculators make great fortunes at national expense, pushing prices ever higher. Thus, from the currency side, consumers are far weaker than suppliers in wielding price control. So in Shanghai today, the most noteworthy cause of price rises is the power of suppliers—hoarding and speculation.</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan: Observing the separate price indices by category, though the rates of increase vary, the consistent trend is upward. Aside from speculative items—such as cash, government bonds, and certain yarns and cotton bales—whose price curves show some fluctuations, other categories have risen in a straight line. Even those with curved trends—aside from securities—when compared month to month or quarter to quarter, continue rising step by step. Broadly speaking, import prices rise linearly, and domestic‑product prices rise in a curved manner. Explaining this by the fall in exchange rates is reasonable: once black‑market rates began to drop and then steadied around eight pence, import prices initially rose in a straight line and should have later shown variation. But did they? I hope that those present who have specialized research on various commodities can offer detailed reports.</p>
<p>Liu Xingchen: Domestic price trends differ greatly across regions—in cities they generally rise, in rural areas they generally fall. The inability of goods to flow freely is a wartime phenomenon, and among all factors, transport plays the greatest role in price changes. Allow me to report on interior prices based on my knowledge: in Henan, eggs now sell at 150 per yuan, fish at 10 jin per yuan… (Editor’s note: Mr. Liu had a detailed report and analysis, regrettably omitted here in full; we apologize and hope Mr. Liu will forgive us.)</p>
<p>Wang Fuli: The commodity with the sharpest price surge today may be cotton cloth. A single piece of 20‐count “Jincheng” cotton cloth now costs 520 yuan, more than double pre‐war prices. Foreign‑exchange contraction, transport difficulties, rising costs, and so on all play a role. But the largest cause is greatly reduced textile‑mill output—mills have shut or been destroyed, cutting production and creating shortages. I will submit a separate written report on the wartime damage to China’s textile‑manufacturing equipment and the current situation. Here I only urge everyone to pay attention to the fact of this production shortfall.</p>
<p>Nie Guangdi: Shanghai and the interior cannot be compared—Shanghai’s circumstances are unique. In a warring nation, major commodities would all be government‑controlled; but what of Shanghai? Has it ever functioned like a city fighting for its life and death? Ordinary merchants, feeling their own safety assured, pursue profits without regard for national interest or public livelihood. Within the Concessions, the Chinese government lacks authority and cannot implement controls. The Concession authorities have at least limited rice prices, but on essential clothing and housing they let prices soar unchecked. Public transit fares—trams and buses—have fortunately not risen much, and even if they did, what recourse would ordinary citizens have?</p>
<p>I have said before that merchant speculation is a major cause of price rises. Take cotton cloth: Shanghai remains a production center, and merchants exploit the interior’s urgent need by selling at high prices. Before Guangzhou’s fall, mills could net over 200 yuan profit per piece; now they clear 70 to 80 yuan. Cloth traders shipping inland naturally add their own margin; when supply is scarce they even monopolize for speculation. Compare the price of one piece of 20‐count cotton cloth in Shanghai and in the interior: in Shanghai it now sells for about 390 yuan, in Kunming around 700 yuan, in Chongqing 850 to 860 yuan, and in Wanxian 950 yuan—more than double Shanghai’s price. Even accounting for costs, the freight and associated fees from Shanghai to those interior destinations are staggering. For example, shipping one piece of 20‑count cotton cloth to Kunming incurs approximately:</p>
<p>Freight (loading and unloading)    59.50 yuan</p>
<p>Taxes and levies (rebated tariff, unified tax, consumption tax)    55.10 yuan</p>
<p>En‑route losses (damaged bales, broken yarn)    8.00 yuan</p>
<p>Warehouse rent and insurance    3.70 yuan</p>
<p>Remittance fees and interest    93.50 yuan</p>
<p>Assuming a base cost of 395 yuan, the total landed cost in Yunnan is 615 yuan; at a selling price of 700 yuan, the merchant nets 85 yuan. Shipping to Chongqing adds at least another 150 yuan in freight and handling, yet even at today’s market price, there remains profit to be made.</p>
<p>Yu Dingyi: The causes of price rises are extremely complex. We must view wartime vs. pre‑war, interior vs. Shanghai, domestic vs. foreign goods, domestic vs. export, regulated vs. unregulated—all together and separately. First, pre‑war price rises stemmed mainly from monetary reforms; post‑war rises stem from the expanding war, causing production halts, supply‑demand imbalances, transport difficulties, and cost increases—so price rises are an inevitable result. Second, interior price rises spring primarily from transport barriers creating shortages, while Shanghai’s rises result from concentrated population and surging demand. Superficially both are due to supply‑demand relations, but essentially they differ: if interior transport improved and freight fell, and if Shanghai’s population were dispersed, price rises would immediately halt. Third, locally produced and consumed goods mostly haven’t risen—like interior agricultural products and Shanghai tobacco and soap—yet when exported they soar; only in overly concentrated cities like Chongqing, Kunming, and Shanghai do even local sales see rises. Fourth, comparing domestic and foreign goods, the former soar because production falls short, the latter because of exorbitant exchange rates; domestic goods are also pushed higher by foreign‑goods price rises, though to a lesser degree. Fifth, regulation or laissez‑faire affects trends—Shanghai rice once climbed to 20 yuan but, upon setting a 14 yuan ceiling, stabilized. Other necessities poised within the purchasing power of the public still trend upward. From these analyses, we see that production declines, transport woes, population concentration, foreign‑exchange highs, supply‑demand imbalances, and rising costs have all come together to produce today’s unprecedented price surge. To balance prices proactively, we must focus on boosting productive capacity and improving transport—without goods to ship, or the ability to ship them, people naturally resort to speculative hoarding. Passively, we must advocate economizing and vigorously implement price‑control policies—the former is easy to promote, the latter more difficult but not impossible; Shanghai’s rice‑price cap is one example. Similar controls on other necessities are indeed necessary. As for luxury goods, we might temporarily let them rise, allowing their own high prices to impose a natural limit. Additionally, harnessing public‐opinion power to launch economizing campaigns and promote price controls on necessities should yield results greater than the effort invested.</p>
<p>Shen Zhenyi: If we compare the rise rates of various commodities, agricultural and industrial goods have risen most sharply. Based on my data:</p>
<p>(1) Among agricultural products, tobacco leaves and tung oil have soared over 200 percent since mid‑April this year compared to pre‑war levels; tung oil up 188 percent; green tea up 150 percent; dried cocoons up 120 percent; raw oil up 93 percent; cotton (lint) up 84 percent. Other items—beef hides, sesame, timber, etc.—have risen between 77 percent and 53 percent, while about ten products have increases below 50 percent.</p>
<p>(2) Among industrial goods, raw silk has jumped 161 percent; pigments 88 percent; in hardware, lead wire 70 percent; in chemical materials, caustic soda nearly 97 percent; in textiles, fine cloth 55 percent. Eleven other industrial items have rises below 47 percent.</p>
<p>(3) In mineral products, coal has the highest increase—from 118 percent to 138 percent; diesel 71 percent; kerosene 64 percent; tin 67 percent; antimony 60 percent; gasoline, litharge, pig iron, etc., have risen between 16 percent and 33 percent.</p>
<p>Summarizing these key agricultural, industrial, and mineral items: of those above 200 percent, all are agricultural; between 150 percent and 200 percent, two agricultural and one industrial; above 100 percent, one agricultural and two mineral; above 50 percent, seven agricultural, six industrial, and five mineral; the rest are under 50 percent. Among these high‑rise items, many are export goods—like tung oil, raw silk, tea, hides, and antimony—which benefit exports and we won’t dwell on them here. But coal, linseed and soybean oils, cotton, cotton yarn, cloth, sesame, pulses, etc., are daily necessities central to people’s clothing and food, yet they too are climbing. The recent surge in raw and soybean oils is particularly alarming, greatly aggravating the hardships of daily life—especially for the many unemployed Shanghai refugees on this island. The impact on social order and stability is alarming and merits our deepest concern.</p>
<h3>Sexual Knowledge Can Guide Us into the Paradise of Love!</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Medical Graduate of the Russian Workers’ University</p>
<p>The famous Italian scholar Hitchmaund once said, “If we wish to step securely into the paradise of love, we need a certain knowledge of sex to guide our progress.” Such knowledge concerns the healthy secrets of marital happiness that every young person needs upon reaching physiological maturity.</p>
<p>The field of sexual health is indeed vast. Among its many aspects, the study of venereal diseases and all knowledge regarding sexuality are especially important because they are closely related to our daily lives.</p>
<p>In the modern society of surging new trends, young people lacking sexual knowledge often overindulge to their detriment, causing needless troubles and sinking into suffering. This not only damages their own health but also jeopardizes the love between husband and wife. Young people ought to pay the utmost attention to this matter.</p>
<p>If one understands that semen is life and health is love, one will know that excessive indulgence is unwise. Therefore, hygiene during adolescence must not be ignored. Normal development generally occurs because the adolescent glands secrete a fluid that promotes whole‑body metabolism and benefits genital development. But if one injures oneself through overindulgence or sexual debauchery, one loses this secretion. As a result, metabolism slows, development halts, and sexual function weakens, leading to premature ejaculation, impotence, and recurrent suffering. The wife then resents and curses you, and looks down on you; a once joyful union goes bankrupt—this misery is self‑inflicted!</p>
<p>When I was in America, I learned that these conditions can only be reversed by actively using endocrine therapy. After returning home, I achieved remarkable results in clinical practice. Among endocrine treatments, the best is the testicular essence preparation “Butikang,” because its effects are long‑lasting. After taking it, sexual function immediately becomes vigorous, neurasthenia is relieved, development is promoted, and whole‑body nutrition improves. In clinical trials, the drug begins acting within sixty minutes, and within twenty‑four hours it works on spermatogenesis and blood enrichment. For women, “Butikang” regulates menstruation. It is likewise a wonder for couples weakened by illness.</p>
<h3>Cough Suppression and Tuberculosis Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>One should know that today’s cough, if not treated quickly, becomes tomorrow’s pulmonary tuberculosis. Although modern scientific therapies can curb it, time and money spent on treatment inevitably increase greatly. The ideal approach is to treat the cough itself. If one misses treatment during the cough stage and lung disease then flares, the medicine “Bufei Nair” has a special effect on pulmonary disease. Its plant‑based formula has a pure and excellent bactericidal action against tubercle bacilli. This remedy is the result of many years of research by Dr. Tumai, who used precious mineral and plant ingredients, repeatedly tested on animals, and improved step by step. Therefore, “Bufei Nair” has exceptionally pure efficacy. Its rapid cough suppression and phlegm‑liquefying action are not merely temporary anesthetic effects.</p>

<h3>Controlling the Rampant Gonococcus</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American MD</p>
<p>The aggressive and rampant gonococcus has cost countless lives and ruined many marriages. In medicine, no researcher has failed to seek a specific cure for gonorrhea, yet none succeeded. This is because most scholars, not understanding the gonococcus’s life conditions, relied on incorrect theories and superficial techniques that could never achieve the goal.</p>
<p>In fact, the pathogen in gonorrhea is the diplococcus, which is highly resistant, able to withstand high heat and low cold, and has weak antitoxic defenses. Thus gonorrhea patients often feel helpless. But this difficulty has now been completely solved. Based on bacteriology and immunology, Dr. Peter learned how the gonococcus lives in the human body and, using a non‑specific therapy of protein mixed with a yellow pigment, created the specific anti‑gonorrhea drug “Klininon.” After taking it, within hours the body’s cells produce an anti‑gonococcal phagocytic action that rushes to the infection site to surround and destroy the bacteria. Where ordinary patent medicines fail, “Klininon” achieves a fundamental cure. Through repeated trials, I have never been disappointed. Used together with “Anti‑Gonorrhea Wash” for urethral rinsing, and in women with gonococcal leucorrhea to cleanse the discharge, the damaged vagina quickly recovers. Even the most stubborn gonorrhea can then be eradicated. Since returning from America, I have cured countless cases. I sincerely offer this experience to sufferers.</p>
<h3>On Women’s Masturbatory Practices</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German MD</p>
<p>Many young people, because of physiological needs, poor environments, and weak willpower, stray into sexual paths and fall into the bad habit of masturbation. Among physiologically mature women, cases are not few, yet female masturbation has received virtually no study. Women’s physiological differences mean its harms are less evident than in men, so women may indulge excessively. Their greater sense of shame leads them to keep silent about the damage. Consequently, some regard female masturbation as unbelievable. But these skeptics usually lack study of physiological hygiene. Medical experts have long known that female masturbation is rising and see it as a major threat to women’s health and happiness.</p>
<p>Women masturbate mostly due to sexual dissatisfaction or genital inflammation. The greatest harm is enlargement of the labia and damage to the clitoris, leading to anorgasmia. Uterine inflammation, physical weakness, breast atrophy, loss of beauty, and menstrual disorders also follow excessive masturbation. Its severity rivals male damage from nocturnal emissions. I earnestly advise self‑stimulating women to stop immediately. They should take the female form of “Butikang” to enhance health and beauty and regulate menstruation. This ovarian endocrine remedy is superb for rejuvenation. Men harmed by masturbation can take the male “Butikang” to replenish losses; those with nocturnal emissions may also take “Neers Emission Tablets.”</p>

<h3>Hazards of Leukorrhea and Prostatic Fluid</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic... No. 9 Ningbo Road, at Sichuan Road Junction</p>
<p>Everyone knows that life begins with the sperm produced in the testes; sperm are the fundamental element of biological life. But another substance is of equal importance: prostatic fluid. In prostatitis, sperm depend on this fluid; without it, they lose motility and perish. Thus prostatic fluid is second only to sperm in reproductive importance.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea’s virulent pathogen and widespread toxins easily invade the prostate, causing gonococcal prostatitis, which risks infertility. This demands urgent treatment. In over twenty years of clinical practice, I have developed special expertise in treating gonococcal prostatitis. The prostate is a key organ in the genital tract but, with proper treatment, is not difficult to cure. I routinely apply German electrotherapy to deliver bactericidal action directly to the lesion and use the holy cure for gonorrhea, “Klininon,” to eliminate gonococci at their source within the tissues. Because “Klininon” is a protein‑yellow pigment complex, it has an anti‑gonococcal phagocytic function that mobilizes all cells to surround and destroy the bacteria, leaving none to escape. Thus prostatitis‑induced reproductive dysfunction is completely cured, and the prostate regains its secretory function, ending the agony of infertility. In over twenty years, I have never failed. Clinic hours: 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; closed Sunday afternoons. Effective immediately, twenty patients are accepted daily; fee per patient: ¥0.5.</p>

<h3>Finance: Stability of British Fine Gold</h3>
<p>In the spot cash and dark‐market gold markets, due to the weekly holiday and recent market quiet, only one or two members attended, and none had buy or sell positions, so there were no price calls. It is reported that money‐exchange houses also saw little activity; the price remained stuck around ¥2,070.</p>
<p>Jewelry gold at pawnshops remains at the original selling price: major firms at ¥210 per tael, new firms at ¥208, purchase at ¥202.</p>

<h3>List of Clearing Banks</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee’s Bill Exchange Office has flourished. Previously, interbank settlements in Shanghai relied on money houses’ transfers. With the Exchange Office, banks exchange bills directly, simplifying procedures. To facilitate the trade, it also handles transfers for money houses, other financial businesses, and nonbank bills. Many banks not yet members open accounts with the Exchange Office for convenience, and some money houses do likewise to process bill collections. Below is a list of current clearing banks, agent clearing banks, branches, and commissioned banks:</p>

<h3>Grain: No Significant Movement in Local Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, mills supplied Japonica rice from lower‑river regions (23 loads), Carriage Wheel Baozi, Su group sent over 2,000 bags; Kunshan group 500 bags; Changzhou group 250 bags. Arrivals remain sparse, and as storerooms continuously release stocks, inventories grow thin. Sellers hold firm, but buyers, enjoying warm weather, hesitate to purchase heavily. Thus street‑level demand is ordinary, speculators receive little inquiry, and prices for thick or thin Japonica rice stay fixed. High‑grade Dosha Japonica remains similar; trade continues moderately; market tone is slightly calmer, with no significant shifts.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Trading Booms with Over 2,000 Bags Opened</h3>
<p>Yesterday the sugar market remained firm; domestic sugar trading was very active, with over 2,000 bags opened. Premium three‑spike sugar sold at ¥24.80 and ¥24.20 per bag; refined ICE sugar at ¥14.00; next grade at ¥23.10; high‑grade white at ¥22.00—a total of over 1,000 bags. Ordinary foreign sugar at ¥17.00, next at ¥16.40—over 200 bags; ordinary brown sugar at ¥15.00 and ¥14.70—700–800 bags; 200 bags of Huangjiang green sugar at ¥14.80–14.90. Prices of foreign sugars saw little change due to the weekly cycle.</p>
<h3>Coal: Lesser‑Quality Anthracite Coal Trading Slow</h3>
<p>Lesser‑quality anthracite coal, due to scant arrivals last winter, sold briskly at elevated prices above premium Huángméng coal. But recently prices have fallen, and trading is slow. Sellers move stocks downstream; dealers cut prices. At Hongji No. 1 terminal, lesser coal sells at ¥44 per ton; Henan coal at ¥42; Haifeng coal at ¥43—all delivered to foreign warehouses, with additional handling fees.</p>
<h3>Dried Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Now for Sale</h3>
<p>Western sea cucumber has recently arrived steadily. A batch was opened for sale: grade A jade at ¥133; second‑grade jade at ¥123; No. 1 jade at ¥110; No. 2 jade at ¥108.60; No. 3 jade at ¥89.60; grade A red at ¥119; second‑grade red at ¥115; No. 1 red at ¥106; central red at ¥86.60; small red at ¥62.20; central bare at ¥158–139; central small bare at ¥116.60; small bare at ¥109.20–104.00. Also a batch of Annan shrimp tails sold as gold hooks at ¥124 per box. It is reported that 3,400 packages of raw starch were imported earlier.</p>

<p>Opinion</p>
<h3>The Answer of Europe’s Small Nations to Germany</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Many state affairs are managed by officials who fancy themselves supremely clever, enough to deceive the whole world, yet their results reveal their true intent, obvious to everyone. At the time they provoke universal laughter, and in the future will be endlessly ridiculed—their folly is boundless! I mention only one case: Germany’s questions to Europe’s small nations cannot but prompt such thoughts.</p>
<p>The answers from these small states are in no way surprising. As the Havas Agency in Washington reported: “These small nations, under the threat of a strongman’s gun, were compelled to comply; their replies are surely insincere.” The Paris United Press telegram added: “If they dared give any definite answer to Hitler’s questions, it would be courting trouble.” Clearly, Europe’s clever people are not only Hitler; the leaders of the small states are no fools—they understand that provoking direct trouble is unwise. Yet their “satisfactory” replies to Hitler are no different from no reply at all.</p>
<p>Of course, with these replies, Hitler can address Roosevelt, claiming Roosevelt overstated matters and misdirected concerns, thus avoiding a direct response to Roosevelt’s inquiry. But what will observers think? Will they share his view?</p>
<p>We believe Roosevelt’s proposal was genuinely constructive: he suggested convening an international conference to discuss world affairs fairly, not to pressure Hitler. His questions—whether Germany and Italy would guarantee no aggression for ten or twenty‑five years—were frank and required no evasive detours. Yet Mussolini and Hitler both evaded direct answers. Who still believes they have any sincerity? Who still values their words?</p>
<p>Hitler’s questions, and his possible future response to Roosevelt, may seem clever to him and help his policy. But through this episode, the small nations will surely awaken: under the threat of a gun, they could only yield to the aggressor’s demands; now they will urgently seek stronger defenses and united resistance. And the United States will clearly see that the two fascist states have no remorse but continue aggression; America will thus cooperate even more closely with democratic allies. Trying to outsmart others may yet backfire—perhaps this is the only tactic left to today’s fascist dictators.</p>
<h3>Foolish (Part II)</h3>
<p>— Green Leaf</p>
<p>They burst into the ancestral hall and encountered no enemy. When they turned to leave, both front and back doors were sealed by the enemy’s curtain of fire. They had no choice but to stay inside, shifting from attack to defense.</p>
<p>The captain said to the men: “Someone must have leaked our plans. They slipped out ahead of us and have come around to encircle us. What we need most now is to notify our ambush teams at once so they can strike from the rear. Then we will sally out from here in concert with them, trap the enemy, and finish them off.” He then asked, “Which brother is willing to go?”</p>
<p>The gunfire outside was even more intense than inside, for there were several machine guns out there, and the rattle of light field guns mixed in with the rifle shots.</p>
<p>“I’ll go, Captain.”</p>
<p>The captain, hearing that, knew at once it was Wang Benzhong.</p>
<p>“You won’t succeed—you still don’t know how to fire your rifle.”</p>
<p>“I can stab with my knife.” Even in the midst of their peril, everyone couldn’t help but laugh.</p>
<p>After Wang Benzhong volunteered, no one else volunteered to go, so the captain allowed him, giving him some last instructions and calling two brothers to help him climb out over the courtyard wall through a skylight. He hoisted himself onto someone’s shoulders, climbed the wall—unheeding the bullets whistling overhead—slipped quietly to the ground with his knife in hand, and crawled toward the wheat field.</p>
<p>Behind the ancestral hall ran a small river, and on the northwest corner of the hall was a small wooden bridge. Following the captain’s orders, he did not cross the bridge but forded the shallow river. Once ashore, he dashed off toward the stone bridge where most of the ambush was set up, some two or three li away from the wooden bridge. This was the main road into the city, hence the greatest concentration of hidden forces.</p>
<p>He found the squad leader and delivered the captain’s orders. The squad leader immediately sent three men out to alert the other ambush positions to attack in unison, then led his men in a forced run toward the ancestral hall.</p>
<p>At that point, Wang Benzhong had no further instructions. The captain had told him only that much; nothing about his personal role afterward. Naturally, he should have followed the squad leader, but they ran so fast in the darkness that in the blink of an eye he was left behind, alone.</p>
<p>From far off the roar of rifles and cannon made a tremendous din. Clutching his knife, he thought for a moment, his mind turning over something, and decided not to run. After another moment’s thought, he turned back toward the stone bridge and sat down there.</p>
<p>Three or four hours of fighting passed, and dawn was breaking in the east. The gunfire gradually thinned, as if the battle were drawing to a close. Wang Benzhong sat dimly aware, still on the bridge, not moving.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the faint morning light, he saw figures rushing toward him. He dropped to the ground and peered closely. As they drew nearer, he recognized two men in yellow uniforms. He felt a surge of excitement, gripped his knife tighter, and prepared himself.</p>
<p>When the two yellow-clad soldiers had climbed five or six steps onto the bridge, Wang Benzhong rose silently behind them. As soon as he could reach them, he swung his knife at the neck of the man in the rear. With a fierce blow, the man toppled completely into the river; whether head and body were separated, he could not tell. The front soldier heard the noise and turned—but by then Wang Benzhong had drawn his knife back and thrust it into the man’s abdomen. The soldier collapsed on the bridge, and before he could struggle, Wang Benzhong kicked him into the river as well.</p>
<p>“Damn it, I got them after all.” Wang Benzhong said this as he stepped off the bridge back to his hiding place.</p>
<p>Then he killed three more in the same way—first two at once, then one by one.</p>
<p>When daylight was fully up, he saw his own main force rushing along the road, so he went to meet them. The captain, seeing him, asked:</p>
<p>“No Japanese got through?”</p>
<p>“None,” Wang Benzhong said. “Not a single one.”</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Folks say they saw several of them coming down this road—where have they gone?”</p>
<p>“Captain, they all ended up in the river.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>When Wang Benzhong explained, no one could keep from laughing—laughing at how clumsy his story sounded—actually quite clever—and laughing at his accomplishment.</p>
<p>The captain, assured none of the enemy had slipped past, ordered everyone to rest for a while.</p>
<p>“How did you end up hiding here?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>“Because you only ordered me to deliver the message, not to return,” Wang Benzhong stammered shyly. Again there was a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>“You’ve done a fine job; today this is your first great feat.”</p>
<p>“Captain,” Wang Benzhong seemed embarrassed, hesitating over his words: “I really am clumsy—I don’t know how to fire a rifle, only how to stab with a knife. Otherwise...”</p>
<p>His words were lost amid the laughter.</p>
<p>“You’re not clumsy,” the captain hurried to say. “You’re not clumsy—don’t say so!”</p>
<p>From then on, Wang Benzhong acquired a nickname: “Wang Not-Clumsy.”</p>
<h3>Salvation Song Ensemble on the Mainland (Woodcut)</h3>
<h3>Silent Wilderness</h3>

<p>In the silent wilderness</p>
<p>A single voice is heard—</p>
<p>Melancholy, forlorn.</p>
<p>I start in wonder:</p>

<h3>The Untold Story from “The Divine Comedy”</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Dante journeyed through Hell.</p>
<p>I have also seen stories of hell on earth.</p>
<p>Time: a desolate midnight. Midnight’s atmosphere is already bleak, and with a few drops of drizzle it grows even more somber.</p>
<p>Place: beside a deserted street. The leaves of the locust trees tremble, rustling like the sighs of ghosts.</p>
<p>I walk at an unhurried, unhurried pace along the roadside. It is still winter; winter’s raindrops are the cruellest things, striking an unprotected head, disheveling one’s hair, dripping down the temples in a tiny waterfall all the way to the eyes. My coat collar is turned up high, yet it cannot block the sharp wind and rain of the winter night. Coldness wants to shake me, but I remain still—walking at that same unhurried, unhurried, moderate pace.</p>
<p>As I round a corner, it grows darker. The streetlamp’s weak glow, shy at my approach, hides behind its gray glass shade, showing only half its light. In the lamp’s glow, I see rain turning into streams of silver threads, slanted in the wind. This is glass, not rain, I think.</p>
<p>There is no one at the street corner; only my own soul remains.</p>
<p>The tree shadows, in the faint light, spread across the ground in patches.</p>
<p>The sky has no color, only black, dark, an emptiness as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>From afar comes a dog’s bark, breaking the momentary stillness, yet it cannot dispel the bleak air. On this cold, dark, quiet street there is only the lonely figure of a man. Who would have thought that apart from me, there are two hundred million souls in the world!</p>
<p>Look: ahead, at the base of a high gray wall, in a recessed gateway, a dark silhouette flickers. It moves toward me. Yes—a person.</p>
<p>In the tranquil air, there is a stir. In this still realm, two living bodies, two souls.</p>
<p>I look into the light. The figure stands distinctly before me. His face, however, is half-hidden by a leaf that masks the glow so I cannot see him clearly. Only on the dark shape I discern a mass of black hair, a few strands falling over his forehead.</p>
<p>A chill runs through me—let me go. I quicken my stride, take larger steps.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of footsteps behind me, following in my steps. It is the man in black, panting, following me. He utters no sigh, only his footsteps echo faintly in the wind-and-rain’s soft ensemble.</p>
<p>“You still come! My lost life!” He slaps my shoulder and shouts.</p>
<p>I panic and can only laugh.</p>
<p>“My lost life!” he cries, his bloodless throat almost spitting sparks.</p>
<p>“Drunkard!”</p>
<p>“I’m not drunk! I only want the life I lost! My soul! I want you to save me, save me! Return my life, my soul.”</p>
<p>I laugh again and again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a crumpled piece of white paper is pushed into my hand. In the dim light of the streetlamp, I look. As I read, he slips away, leaving only the echo of his footsteps.</p>
<p>I lean forward under the lamp’s faint glow. On the paper, in bold characters:</p>
<p>“Hongkou Pass Permit.”</p>
<p>It turns out...</p>
<p>Once more the street holds only me, the wind painted by rain, the lamp rendered thin.</p>
<h3>What We Should Do</h3>
<p>— Hong Zhong</p>
<p>Ever since Shanghai became an isolated island, our citizens, though threatened by the invaders, have not forgotten the nation or neglected the resistance. For example, the fervor for rescue work, the enthusiasm for donating to relief funds, and the development of wartime culture all clearly demonstrate this. Yet some among us have unconsciously drifted into corrupt ways of thinking and behaving. Some still lack confidence that the resistance will prevail: they feel despair upon hearing news of a city’s fall, and elation at reports of our victories. Others adopt an “let the Communists handle it” attitude toward the war, caring not at all about saving the nation but only about their own temporary safety, forgetting the peril that threatens them personally. They are selfish and self-serving, clinging to life by any means, without a unifying faith or coherent action to aid the country.</p>
<p>The significance of national spiritual mobilization is profound and far-reaching: it aims to correct all irrational beliefs and habits that impede the war effort. It can be said to be the timeless principle of nation-building. Now that our resistance has entered the second phase, shifting from defense to offense, it ought to be fully embraced by the whole country.</p>
<p>This war is the war of a national revolution; it carries the two great purposes of revolution and reconstruction. To align ourselves with the national policy of resistance and state-building, our daily lives and spiritual endeavors must be both combative and constructive.</p>
<p>Every point laid out in the National Spiritual Mobilization Charter should be put into practice. We must adopt “the nation above all, the people above all, military affairs first, victory second” as our sole objective. We must reform our past life of drunken reverie, cultivate a vigorous and dynamic spirit, break down selfish, self-interested motives, and correct mixed and misguided thoughts. In our everyday lives we must put each of these into action.</p>
<p>Until final victory is achieved, we must continually and honestly examine ourselves; we must cleanse ourselves of past flaws during this war; our national spirit must advance with the wartime progress; we must lead serious and disciplined personal lives, uphold the principle of resisting to the end; we must align our words and deeds so that our ordinary way of life truly reflects the realities of wartime living.</p>
<p>In today’s campaign of national spiritual mobilization, every one of us on the isolated island must at least do the following: affirm our conviction that resistance will prevail and state-building will succeed; refuse to buy substandard goods; donate generously to relief funds; and launch anti-sabotage efforts.</p>
<p>Mass Weekly</p>

<h3>Mass Weekly to Be Published Separately</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Since Mass Weekly first appeared in this newspaper on December 5, 1938 (Republic Year 27), twenty issues have now been published.</p>
<p>In these twenty issues, pieces such as “National Heroes,” “Stone Boy,” “Yuan Chonghuan,” “Popular Songs,” “Wen Tianxiang,” “Hua Mulan,” “General Knowledge,” “Newspaper Literacy,” “Refugees’ Songs,” “Everyday Life Knowledge,” “Please Do Not Spit,” and others have all aroused readers’ enthusiastic sympathy. And in each issue, readers’ contributions as well as the advocacy of thrift and relief efforts, the enhancement of production work, and so on have had a tremendous impact—something of which this magazine can be proud.</p>
<p>However, space in the magazine is limited, and not all submitted manuscripts can be printed, often disappointing authors. Also, since this magazine is a supplement to Shenbao, there are plans to launch other weeklies. Therefore, this magazine will in future be published independently, which we believe readers and authors will welcome.</p>
<p>As this magazine is the people’s publication, we hope the public will continue in the same spirit as before to support it, so that it may grow even stronger. The editorial staff will follow the people’s lead, work together, and press onward!</p>
<p>Finally, we must express our deep gratitude to Shenbao for its resolute and enthusiastic cooperation with the Refugee Association, which has helped this magazine gain popular favor.</p>
<h3>Aid for Refugees (Broadcast Ballad at No. 1 Shelter on Dunxin Road)</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>A thunderclap splits the blue sky;</p>
<p>Half a year passes in an instant.</p>
<p>Every province, every city struck by calamity,</p>
<p>Pitiful cries fill the land.</p>
<p>Some families are torn apart, kin scattered;</p>
<p>Some flee for long, bereft of funds.</p>
<p>Drifting without home or hearth,</p>
<p>No one to borrow from, tears streaming.</p>
<p>Rumbling tummies cannot be sated,</p>
<p>Shivering bodies lack clothes,</p>
<p>In every street corner they linger.</p>
<p>Watching strangers become hungry ghosts,</p>
<p>Their bones destined for mass graves.</p>
<p>Such misery is beyond words,</p>
<p>Such fate defies description.</p>
<p>Thankfully, many kind souls,</p>
<p>Rise without hesitation to compassion.</p>
<p>They form refugee relief societies,</p>
<p>Tireless, undaunted by hardship.</p>
<p>Committees from every trade appeal,</p>
<p>All sectors solicit donations.</p>
<p>“As grains unite to form a tower,”</p>
<p>“From the smallest scrap one makes a quilt.”</p>
<p>Some come from associations with pledges,</p>
<p>Some from funeral rites funded by provinces.</p>
<p>Some save daily spending,</p>
<p>Some shun alcohol and tobacco,</p>
<p>Some children, full of resolve,</p>
<p>Set aside their candy money each day.</p>
<p>Truly, saving one life is merit,</p>
<p>Better than building a pagoda atop a stupa.</p>
<p>Now refugees have a place to rest,</p>
<p>Thanks to your boundless blessings.</p>
<p>When the household chants poems and the zither is plucked…</p>
<h3>The Importance of Public Health on the Isolated Island</h3>
<p>— Yucai</p>
<p>Public health concerns the health of many, and is even more important than personal hygiene, for personal uncleanliness harms only the individual, but public uncleanliness harms many. Thus, while living in public spaces, we must attend to personal hygiene and also to public health—that is our responsibility. Especially on this isolated island of five million residents, public health matters more than food. Here are a few everyday ordinary things for all citizens to note. This is meant to inspire further reflection: we must each strive to be mindful at all times and places.</p>
<p>Do Not Spit in Public</p>
<p>Spitting is a bad habit among our people; it spreads tuberculosis and causes great harm. A “No Spitting” campaign was held on March 26th by the Women’s Youth Association and other health groups. The results, though positive, are far from complete, since habits are hard to break. The fundamental remedy is to strengthen our bodies so the lungs grow robust and naturally produce less sputum.</p>
<p>Do Not Urinate in Public</p>
<p>Urinating in public is truly indecent. In hot weather, every lane reeked of stench—highly unsanitary. If you must relieve yourself in public, always use the latrine. At the same time, we hope authorities will increase the number of public toilets—this is also a proactive measure.</p>
<p>Do Not Discard Fruit Peels or Rubbish in Public</p>
<p>Littering fruit peels or paper scraps spoils the city’s appearance and is unsanitary. Banana peels, melon rinds, and the like are especially slippery and can attract mosquitoes, spreading disease.</p>
<p>Human life is fundamentally communal—our interests and well-being are intertwined. What benefits others benefits me; what harms others harms me. Therefore, anything that is beneficial to others we should pursue as we would our own benefit. This is both hygiene and public welfare.</p>

<h3>Threshold to Reading Newspapers (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tan Tian</p>
<p>News Reporters: News reporters are directly the providers of news for newspapers, and indirectly the megaphones for the people’s knowledge. Yet most reporters today, due to life’s pressures, occasionally become blinded by money, accept bribes from private individuals, and betray their mission. Thus their accounts of the news are often biased and cannot be recorded completely objectively. Even the more objective reports inevitably bear some slant. Only the reader’s discernment can see through it. There is another role called a “visiting correspondent,” whose duties are similar to those of a news reporter, except that they mostly gather news from the area where the newspaper is based.</p>
<p>News Agencies: The names of news agencies appear everywhere in newspapers. Usually at the start of each item you see the name of a certain agency—indicating that the item was issued by that agency. There are many agencies: Reuters, Agence Havas, TASS, the Associated Press, United Press, Huitong Agency, and Domei Agency. These news agencies are well‑organized; besides dispatching domestic and foreign news, they also supply intelligence directly to their governments. Naturally they are organizations representing their governments, and their tone of reporting is aimed at serving their governments’ interests. Our country’s news industry is underdeveloped and there are very few agencies. Not only is international news supplied by the major news agencies above, even domestic news is often issued on our behalf. For example, you may see “Central News Agency, [Place] [Date], Reuters wire.” This shows that Reuters’ international dispatches are translated into Chinese and then handed over to the Central News Agency for release. As a result, the supply of news is smooth but inevitably distorted or confused, misleading the facts. There is no avoiding it, and it is not a good arrangement. As for each agency’s standpoint and purpose in reporting, they differ. A single news item may have several different presentations by different agencies. Readers who do not understand the details will surely be perplexed. We will provide a detailed explanation on this point later.</p>
<p>Special Correspondents: A special correspondent is a reporter sent out by a newspaper on a particular assignment. For example, those dispatched to foreign locations to gather news, or those sent to report on international conferences and other major domestic and foreign events, are all special correspondents. Overseas dispatches in newspapers are the manuscripts sent by these special correspondents. Newspapers also often have what they call “exclusive telegrams” from our paper, which refer to the telegraphs sent by our own designated correspondents. Their duties are not the same as those of special correspondents.</p>
<p>Authorized Telegrams: When a major incident occurs in the country, newspapers often publish authorized telegrams. The issuer of an authorized telegram is either an organization or a prominent person; its significance is directly related to current affairs, so it is extremely important. Speaking of newspaper news, everyone knows there are many categories: international news, domestic news, social news, local news, economic news, cultural news, and so on. Each type of news occupies its own section in the paper, and a reader can easily find whichever category they wish. However, each category has some aspects that are difficult to understand; without explanation, full comprehension is hard to achieve.</p>
<p>International News: Publishing foreign reports in one’s own country’s newspaper is called international news. For example, current items such as the fall of Czechoslovakia, the peace negotiations in Spain, and the Soviet‑Japanese fisheries dispute are all international news. Today the world’s democratic countries and fascist countries hold two opposing interests and viewpoints, and socialist countries are in absolute conflict with fascist countries. The fall of Czechoslovakia and the civil war in Spain are steps in fascist aggression—Japan’s invasion of China is the same. The Soviet‑Japanese fisheries dispute, meanwhile, is one form of confrontation between socialist and fascist countries. Such descriptions follow the current controversies, but in reality the world now has only two opposing camps: (1) socialist societies; (2) capitalist societies. Fascism is merely the vanguard of capitalism attacking socialism. They were originally united. Judging by current events, fascist countries not only aim to assault socialist countries, but also to redraw boundaries among major powers, thereby creating a conflict between the front of aggression and the front of democracy. This cannot be summarized in a few sentences; we will discuss it in detail later. In short, in today’s world, whether socialist or capitalist, their struggles affect our nation and our lives. We must study international news to find our path to survival amid complex global issues. Therefore, international news is extremely important.</p>
<p>Domestic News: News about events occurring in our own country—whether in one province or another locality—that affect our interests is called domestic news. For instance, reports on the battles in Nanchang, fighting in Hangzhou, and various clashes between Chinese and Japanese forces across the country are all domestic news. Regardless of distance, they are all current events unfolding within China’s interior; thus they are domestic news. Some papers append a “lengthy dispatch” at the end of a news item, providing a more detailed account for readers to peruse.</p>
<p>Social News: The social news section covers items related to contemporary society, such as landlord‑tenant disputes, accidental fires, kidnappings and ransoms, property conflicts, rape, abuse, suicide, opium, gambling, and the like. The writing is colloquial, and the events described are all tied to present‑day society, so novice readers generally enjoy them. However, with society’s downturn, some papers sensationalize social news with material catering to low tastes—stories of monsters and demons, anecdotes about prostitutes, catching adulterers and taking them to court, etc. These are called “soft news,” meant only to entertain the leisured elite and of no benefit to ordinary laborers. Therefore, we would do well to ignore such news in the future. Instead, we should read the social news that expose injustices and call for reform, which have real meaning. From these we can glean not just factual insights but also understand the truth and the root causes.</p>
<p>Local News: Newspapers often have a “city news” heading, and naturally there should also be “local news.” However, in practice, some papers do not distinguish local news from domestic news; others combine it with social news; still others do not call it “local news” but label it “county reports” or “regional dispatches.” Each paper’s editing style differs, so the labels vary. In our view, despite the different names, local news remains important because it reflects the conditions of a given locality.</p>
<p>Economic News: No matter what paper you pick up, there is usually a special column for economic news. But this type of economic news only covers market conditions for rice, wheat, silk, tea, tung oil, sugar, and the like, as well as foreign exchange rates, premiums and discounts, bonds, and gold quotations. News on absorbing silver or stabilizing silver currency is given separate coverage. Generally speaking, this division is unreasonable, so economic news today is inseparable from business news; we will explain this to readers later. Moreover, economic news is full of technical terms that laypersons find hard to understand. Here we might as well mention a few: borrowing 100 foreign dollars and paying daily interest is called “foreign discount”; a bill payable the next day is called a “tom”; a bill payable on the same day is called a “spot”; exchanging large silver coins for small coins is called “arbitrage”; futures trading—buying now and selling later—is called “long” or “bull”; selling now and buying later is called “short” or “bear.” This column includes: (1) financial markets, subdivided into domestic and foreign exchange, gold market, silver market, securities market, etc.; (2) commodity markets, subdivided into rice market, flour market, miscellaneous grains and oil cake market, silk and tea market, cotton market, yarn and fabric market. In addition, there is the benchmark gold price, calculated in national currency. Price changes depend on the silver price: if silver rises, gold falls; if silver falls, gold rises. Securities include both government bonds and stocks; rumors or changes in the situation can cause prices to drop. Regular readers of this section are traders, but ordinary people should also pay attention at all times, because the rise and fall of money prices inevitably influence daily commodity prices. Thus economic news relates not only to our everyday lives but also to the nation’s economic lifeblood, and everyone must understand it.</p>

<h3>Everyone Weighs In</h3>
<p>— Gong Chang</p>
<p>Old Chen meets Old Zhang;</p>
<p>Everyone weighs in:</p>
<p>“On August 13th the fighting began,</p>
<p>Chickens flew, dogs scrambled up the walls.”</p>
<p>Your family fled, scattering like crows;</p>
<p>Mine was burned, leaving only ashes.</p>
<p>Old Sun meets Old Tang;</p>
<p>Everyone weighs in,</p>
<p>Talking straight from the heart,</p>
<p>Their eyes brimming with tears:</p>
<p>Your son fell under the gun,</p>
<p>My child perished by the bullet.</p>
<p>Old Li meets Old Yang;</p>
<p>Everyone weighs in:</p>
<p>Living in a camp for displaced people—</p>
<p>Is that better than returning home?</p>
<p>Your roof tiles now pave the road;</p>
<p>My fields are fenced off by the mills.</p>
<p>Old Xu meets Old Wang;</p>
<p>Everyone weighs in:</p>
<p>Relying on others won’t last long—</p>
<p>A man must strengthen himself.</p>
<p>You have the skill to save the nation;</p>
<p>I have the means to defend my home.</p>
<p>Old Zhou meets Old Yang;</p>
<p>Once more they weigh in:</p>
<p>For now, we endure a hard life,</p>
<p>And then we will plan again.</p>
<p>You say even stones have their day;</p>
<p>I say refugees may yet find a good outcome.</p>
<h3>Responsibility</h3>
<p>— Nan Jizhe</p>
<p>Why we must assist refugees has already been stated; how to assist refugees has already been explained; what refugees themselves ought to do has already been covered. In short, all actions must be proactive! Proactivity is different from passive charity. Passive charity is purely an obligation; proactivity becomes a responsibility. In helping refugees, we bear the responsibility of turning them into non‑refugees; as refugees, we bear the responsibility of becoming non‑refugees ourselves. Each fulfills their duty, and thus the refugee problem is completely solved!</p>
<h3>A Week of Combat</h3>
<p>— Wu Guang</p>
<p>Guangdong</p>
<p>The Chinese forces in Guangdong have been exceptionally successful this week, recapturing large amounts of territory and sending successive reports of victories along every front. Victories in Guangdong and Hubei have invigorated all sides. The current situation on each front continues to unfold; the fruits of Japan’s efforts over recent months have been entirely swept away, and signs of new victories have already appeared. The situation by region is summarized below:</p>
<p>Guangdong Chinese troops, displaying extraordinary courage, encountered the Japanese at every turn this week and advanced with remarkable speed. In the Dongjiang area, they attacked from multiple routes towards Zengcheng, first seizing key points around the city, then charging straight in. After fierce street fighting, they fully recaptured the city. In the Beijiang area, after taking Huaxian, Chinese forces joined with other units to push on toward Guangzhou. Reports indicate they are only twelve miles from Guangzhou, and the sound of artillery can already be heard from inside the city. Their progress is noteworthy. West of the river, Chinese forces have drawn near Sanshui, and Foshan is under siege. In short, the operations in this sector have completed the encirclement of Guangzhou, and the Japanese forces trapped within are in a state of panic.</p>
<p>Henan</p>
<p>In eastern Henan, Chinese troops recently made a swift assault into Kaifeng, skirmishing with Japanese forces for days before seizing this crucial central plain stronghold. This week, buoyed by their momentum, they have pushed south toward Nanguan. The Japanese, pressed for time, relocated over two thousand reinforcements along the Longhai Railway to respond. However, these reinforcements were ambushed by Chinese forces at Zhangzhuang, resulting in brutal fighting and significant Japanese casualties. Simultaneously, another Chinese contingent took advantage of the situation to capture Tongxu County, cutting the Longhai line and severing the Japanese front from its rear. Chinese forces besieging Xinyang in southern Henan are converging on the city. Though the Japanese garrison resists tenaciously, their position is untenable.</p>
<p>Hubei</p>
<p>In northern Hubei, to defend the strongpoints of Yingshan and Anlu, Japanese forces launched several flanking counterattacks against the Chinese troops encroaching on these county seats. Chinese units blocked them at multiple points, and after days of fierce combat—even despite the Japanese use of poison gas—the attackers could not advance. At dawn on the 17th, the entire Japanese front collapsed and fled; after a vigorous pursuit, both towns are now under Chinese siege. Around Zhongxiang in central Hubei, Chinese forces have successively retaken the surrounding areas. During the week, the Japanese in the city made several sorties but were driven back each time. West of Yuekou, Japanese reinforcements advancing via the Heiliu Ferry to aid Zhongxiang were ambushed before dawn on the 17th. After two days of bloody fighting, by the evening of the 18th the Japanese forces had been annihilated.</p>
<p>Shanxi</p>
<p>In southern Shanxi, Chinese units launched a rapid large‑scale sweep against Japanese garrisons in Xiaxian and Wenxi counties, inflicting a severe blow. The Japanese attempted to send reinforcements from Anyun, but these forces were intercepted and attacked en route, and the remnants retreated the same way they had come. In Jinzhong and Yicheng, over two thousand Japanese troops launched an offensive against Chinese lines, but using maneuvers and tactical feints, Chinese forces split them into segments and defeated them one by one. The remaining Japanese withdrew into their towns, which were then captured in the ensuing pursuit. In western Shanxi, around Lishi and Zhongyang, Chinese forces have attacked vigorously all week, achieving notable successes. Japanese attempts to cross west of the river have been repelled.</p>

<h3>Pre-War Shanghai Municipal Construction (II)</h3>
<p>— Linlang</p>
<p>(2) Libraries and Museums. These two institutions serve as spiritual nourishment for urban residents and mark the first step in cultural development. The Shanghai Municipal Government specifically constructed one library on the Right Fu South Road and one museum on the Left Fu South Road. All the buildings are extremely grand. Construction began in October of the 23rd year and was completed in January of the 25th year. Each of the library and museum measures 350 feet north–south by 550 feet east–west. Well‑maintained roads surround the entire complex. The buildings are two stories high, with a central section rising in the style of a Beijing city gate tower. Interior designs vary with purpose. Both natural and artificial lighting are abundant. Externally, the two structures present a plain and simple yet solemn appearance—harmonizing traditional Chinese style with practical needs to create a unique aesthetic. The exterior walls are faced with artificial granite, giving them a solid, refined look. The museum has virtually no windows above the ground floor. Exhibition halls rely entirely on natural light; the design ensures that visitors cannot see the light’s source, and walls receive more light than floors. Wherever paintings hang, light enters from high side windows, so that visitors standing below are not overexposed to brightness, yet the finest details of the wall displays are fully revealed. Air‑conditioning units at the foundation level keep rooms warm in winter and cool in summer, maintaining a proper temperature and fresh air. Thus, despite the lack of upper‑floor windows, visitors feel perfectly comfortable. The library contains two large reading rooms, each 32 by 86 feet. The floors are laid with cork, ensuring quiet footsteps that do not disturb others. The stacks are located at the rear of the building, isolated by fire doors, and can hold up to 500,000 volumes. The floors are made of glass bricks supported by steel frames, providing excellent illumination. Two summers ago, when the Municipal Government held its tenth‑anniversary celebrations, the literature and art exhibition and the municipal exhibition were held at the museum and library respectively.</p>
<p>(3) Hospital and Public Health Laboratory. In the central district on Huayuan Road a large hospital and public health laboratory occupy over eighty acres. Work began in December of the 23rd year and was finished in May of the 25th year. The initially completed hospital buildings measure 277 feet long and 53 feet wide, totaling about 12,000 square feet. The structure has four stories, with the central two stories raised to the height of a six‑story building; total volume is about 555,000 cubic feet and total floor area about 49,000 square feet. Under normal conditions it accommodates 150 beds, with capacity for an additional 50 in emergencies. The ground floor houses boilers and electrical machinery; the first floor contains administrative offices, X‑ray rooms, special consultation rooms, outpatient clinics, reception rooms, an information desk, a pharmacy, a laboratory, and emergency rooms; the second floor is for the surgical department and the men’s operating theater; the third floor houses obstetrics and gynecology and the children’s ward; the fourth floor is for staff quarters and the kitchen. All hospital facilities are remarkably complete. East of the hospital stands the public health laboratory on about fifteen acres. The three‑story building measures 134 by 49 feet, with a volume of roughly 220,000 cubic feet. The first floor includes an information desk, reception rooms, doctors’ offices, the director’s office, a library, administrative offices, a materials room, and a sterilization chamber; the second floor has vaccine and serum culture rooms; the third floor contains chemical laboratories, research rooms, an exhibition hall, and an auditorium. For practical use, the interior is equipped with gas, vacuum, compressed air, high‑frequency, direct and alternating current, high‑pressure steam, and electrically refrigerated installations.</p>
<p>Municipal Parks</p>
<p>In the city center, the “Shanghai First Park” was the inaugural public park. Construction began in January of the 21st year, was halted for about five months by the “January 28 Incident,” and by the end of the 22nd year the main landscaping was substantially complete. Further enhancements thereafter resulted in beautiful grounds. The park lies in the western part of the central administrative area, between Guohe Road, North Guoji Road, Zhengtong Road, and Zhengtong Road, covering about 340 acres. The park divides into five areas:</p>
<p>- Main Gate Area (southwest corner), the principal entrance, with grand scenery and a shallow sandpit for children’s play.</p>
<p>- Flower Garden Area (west).</p>
<p>- Woodland Area (center), the largest section.</p>
<p>- Sports Field (east), featuring ball courts, a 400‑foot running track, and seating for 7–8,000 spectators.</p>
<p>- Lake and Island Area (southeast), connected to the Qiu River, offering boating, fishing, and lotus gathering—the park’s most scenic spot.</p>
<p>Initial landscaping focused on earthworks for the Sports Field, the largest task, carried out in three phases at a cost of over 23,500 labor units and moving more than 10,000 cubic feet of earth. The field was turfed, and flower beds planted around its perimeter. Horticultural works included planting over 30,000 trees and saplings, more than 60,000 flowering plants, and thousands of square meters of lawn. Besides four wooden and stone bridges, there is one stone arch, one artificial stone hill, and one artificial earth hill.</p>
<p>Water, Electricity, and Transportation</p>
<p>(1) Tap Water. In the city center, tap water is supplied by the Zhabei Water and Power Company. The network comprises 5,400 meters of 600‑mm diameter mains and 27,860 meters of 100‑mm diameter pipes as laid out by the Public Utilities Bureau. The first phase, about 25 kilometers, is complete. Remaining sections can be installed on demand; any user guaranteed by the Municipal Government may extend mains without paying extension fees. Thus, city‑center residents benefit more from tap water than those in other Shanghai districts.</p>
<p>(2) Electricity and Street Lighting. Initially, electricity came via a 6,600‑volt line along Gongnong Road, connecting northwards to the Zhabei Water and Power Company’s Jiansongqiao Plant and southwards to its Pingliang Road substation (which receives power from the Shanghai Power Company). Therefore, the city center is doubly supplied, eliminating fears of prolonged outages. By the summer of the 26th year, about 8 kilometers of high‑voltage lines and 13 kilometers of low‑voltage lines in the first phase had been installed, and streetlights erected wherever lines ran. Streets are fully lit at night, ensuring safe travel.</p>
<p>(3) Telephone. The city center’s telephone service was initially routed from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau’s Zhabei branch to the Jiangwan branch, then along Tiyuhui Road, Xiangyin Road, Songhu Road, and Sanmin Road on fifty-pair cables into the district. Twenty-five pairs went to the Municipal Government’s exchange for external trunk lines; the remaining twenty-five served other local users, connecting via the Jiangwan exchange to the Zhabei branch. By the 26th year, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau had established area exchanges with 400 automated lines linked to the Zhabei branch, forming a comprehensive network.</p>
<p>(4) Public Buses. The primary transport in the city center is public buses operated by the Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company. Services began in spring of the 23rd year. By the 26th year, Routes 4, 5, and 6 ran between the center, North Station, Leping Road, and the Zhabei Water and Power Plant. Route 4 (Zhabei Beijing–Shanghai Station to the city center) is about 10.5 kilometers long; a round trip takes about thirty minutes, including seven minutes of stops, at an average speed of 27 km/h. Twelve buses provide a departure every five minutes. For shorter trips, well‑equipped rickshaws are available.</p>
<p>Qiujiang Wharf</p>
<p>For decades, wharves and warehouses have lined both banks of the Huangpu River for mooring and cargo handling. However, the river’s narrow, shallow waters, despite dredging, still hinder deep‑draft vessels, and loading/unloading remains difficult. Since launching its “Prosperous Shanghai Plan,” the Municipal Government has focused on port development and modern wharves. On the plan’s adoption day in the 23rd year, the Central Bank decided to invest in Qiujiang Wharf and its warehouses. On September 4th they formed the Qiujiang Wharf Design Committee. In August of the following year, with designs completed, the committee became the Construction Committee and building began. Groundbreaking was on June 20th of the 25th year. The project had three phases; the first phase was completed in summer of the 26th year and officially opened on June 12th. Thus the Qiujiang Wharf, unrivaled in the Far East, was revealed to the world. The first vessel to berth was the state‑owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Fairness; soon after, the Nippon Queen, one of the largest Far East liners, made its inaugural stop on the 13th. Sadly, after the August 13th incident, this much‑anticipated wharf suffered bombing damage, becoming a battlefield—tragic indeed! The following records its construction process and warehouse details:</p>
<p>(1) Location and Works. Qiujiang Wharf lies on the west bank of the Huangpu River at No. 90 Shangzi, north of the Qiu River mouth. Approximately 800 acres of shoal and 300 acres of adjacent land were acquired and raised to 19.5 feet above Wusong datum, yielding a shoreline about 3,000 feet long by 1,000 feet wide for wharf and stacking facilities. Work proceeded in three phases. The first phase built two 590‑foot wharves; two two‑story reinforced‑concrete warehouses; and two iron‑roofed flat warehouses, at a cost of 5 million yuan. These occupy the southern third of the site. Plans call for a straight wharf 3,000 feet long, eight four‑story steel‑frame warehouses, three iron‑roofed flat warehouses, and a southern barge port. About 1,000 feet inland runs Pu West Road, the north–south artery, and Wuqian Road, the east–west artery connecting to the city center. A public wharf of 350 feet lies at the north end of the district. Hoisting cranes and light‑rail tracks on the wharf decks in front of each warehouse handle cargo. Land alongside Pu West Road is reserved for travel agencies, shipping companies, freight forwarders, motor transport firms, hotels, and related agencies.</p>
<p>(2) Combined Rail, Water, and Air Transport. As Shanghai is the major hub for Yangtze River cargo distribution, the wharf plan includes rail lines before and after the warehouses connecting to the Songhu railway, linking to all trunk routes (Beijing‑Zhejiang, Pingjin, Guangdong, etc.) for intermodal transport. Imports can be unloaded to trains for inland delivery; exports loaded from trains directly onto ships for overseas shipment without intermediate stacking, saving time and costs. These tracks span about nine kilometers, estimated to cost 750,000 yuan. Thousands of acres around the wharf are designated for an airport, with a separate seaplane anchorage on the river, enabling water‑land‑air intermodal freight transport.</p>
<p>(3) The Wharves. The two 590‑foot wharves completed in the first phase each have 50‑foot‑wide decks equipped with mooring piles and cross piles for barges. Decks house rotating cranes; lower decks allow small boats to operate at low tide. Whereas other Shanghai wharves can only host vessels with up to 30‑foot draft, Qiujiang Wharf’s straight shoreline, wide river front, and deep water accommodate vessels with up to 33‑foot draft—no tide waiting, no danger, even the Queen Mary can dock here safely.</p>
<p>(4) Warehouses. The two first‑phase reinforced‑concrete warehouses measure 220 by 130 feet; upper floors for long‑term storage, lower floors for short‑term storage. The iron‑roofed flat warehouses, each 220 by 80 feet with three bridges to the wharf deck, serve as temporary short‑term storage. Total capacity is about 15,000 tons. Hoisting cranes on the decks lift cargo directly from ship holds to any warehouse floor. Inspection cranes in front of the lower floors lift goods to upper floors. Rear freight elevators enable one‑way internal flow.</p>
<p>(5) Transportation. The city center’s public road network designates two main arteries: Pu West Road (north–south) from Yangshupu along the Huangpu west bank parallel to Gongnong Road, ending at Wusong; and Wuqian Road (east–west) from the northern edge of the first wharf area across Gongnong Road to the city center. These roads, costing 150,000 yuan, were built jointly by the Central Bank and Municipal Government. Upon opening, three bus routes served the wharf: 1) Wuqian Road to Gongnong Road to Yangshupu Road; 2) Wuqian Road through the city center to Qimei Road in the International Settlement; 3) Wuqian Road through the city center to Jiangwan Road to North Sichuan Road. Bus trips take no more than twenty minutes.</p>
<p>(6) Other Buildings. First‑phase construction also includes an office building between the warehouses; staff dormitories for forty people; and a 257,400‑square‑foot open cargo yard.</p>
<p>(B) Other Construction</p>
<p>Shanghai’s construction proceeded in two parts: new works in the city center district and the renovation or expansion of existing facilities in Nanshi, Zhabei, and other districts. Section A above covered the large, meticulously planned new projects that founded the New City. The following summarizes the reorganization and expansion in the older districts over the ten years from the 17th to the 26th year. Projects are listed without further classification into civil works and utilities. City‑center projects are omitted here.</p>
<p>City Divisions</p>
<p>To promote balanced municipal development, the Shanghai Municipal Government, after studying various needs and field conditions, divided Shanghai into the following districts:</p>
<p>(1) Administrative District: the central portion of the city center district.</p>
<p>(2) Industrial District: both banks of Wusong and Unzao Bays; south of Guohuo Road in Nanshi; Zhabei along Liuying River and Hengbang River; and the Pudong area from Qingning Temple south to Yangsigang Bay.</p>
<p>(3) Residential and Commercial District: within Shanghai South City Temple; south of Yuyuan Road in the west; north of Qiaoqiao Road; west of Haige Road; and east of Kaixuan Road.</p>
<p>(4) Oil Depot District: Gaoqiao and Sha areas.</p>
<p>(5) Timber Industry Area: from the southern end of the North Piao Coal Mine Company along the river to Jiangshan Road.</p>
<p>Roads and Drains</p>
<p>(1) South Shanghai District: most streets were unpaved. Over the past ten years, the Municipal Works Bureau has successively opened and improved main roads. Eastmen Road, Heping Road, and Liming Road from Eastmen Road to Damaitou Street now have drain pipes and asphalt paving. Other roads with drains include Lujiahong Road, Xietu Road, Zhizaoju Road, Dapu Road, and Luban Road.</p>
<p>(2) Zhabei District: roads here were also mostly unpaved. Asphalt resurfacing and water‑pipe installation were carried out on Datong Road, Gonghe Road, Hengfeng Road, and the southern section of Baoshan Road. After the January 28 Incident, the district’s roads were almost entirely destroyed. The Works Bureau rebuilt all routes according to plan and resurfaced the northern section of Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road, Baoxing Road, Baochang Road, Hongxing Road, and Baoyuan Road with asphalt. Utility lines were upgraded and paved. Streets in Jiangwan and Wusong were also overhauled.</p>
<p>(3) Pudong District: Pudong Avenue was opened and Chunshan Street and others were reorganized. Over ten years, 84,171 meters of asphalt roads, 3,915 meters of small‑block stone paving, 5,098 meters of gravel roads, 213,125 meters of unpaved roads, and 222,071 meters of coal‑scoria roads were laid. Drains totaling 189,508 meters were installed.</p>
<p>Bridges and Wharves</p>
<p>(1) Bridges: Shanghai’s urban waterways are led by the Huangpu River, followed by the Wusong River and Unzao Bay. To enhance cross‑river traffic, 258 bridges were built over ten years at a cost of over 938,000 yuan. Major bridges include Hengfeng Bridge, Wuzhen Bridge, Caojiadu Bridge, No. 3 Zhongshan Road Bridge over the Wusong River, and Unzao Bay Bridge.</p>
<p>(2) Wharves and Quays: construction of wharves and quays along the Huangpu and Wusong Rivers has been a key project. Over ten years, ninety‑four wharves were built at a cost exceeding 320,000 yuan. New quays totaling 3,771 meters cost about 279,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Municipal Buildings</p>
<p>(1) Administrative offices: the city government and various bureau office buildings in the city center district. (See Section A, “Construction in the City Center District.”)</p>
<p>(2) Cultural and educational facilities: sports grounds, gymnasiums, swimming pools, libraries, museums, the zoo, the botanical garden, and newly built schoolhouses.</p>
<p>(3) Public health and public facilities: the municipal hospital, South Shanghai municipal hospital, Public Health Testing Institute, North Shanghai District health office, municipal infectious disease hospital, municipal first cemetery, various vegetable markets, Wusong Park, First Park, and Wenmiao Park.</p>
<p>(4) Welfare for the common people: three commoner residences on Quanjiaan Road, Xietu Road, Jiaotong Road, etc., and four commoner villages on Zhongshan Road, Qimei Road, Pushan Road, and Taipingqiao Road, totaling 1,848 rooms. Over the past ten years, newly constructed municipal buildings cost a total of 4,999,148 yuan and 6 jiao 8 fen.</p>

<h3>Encouraging “Marriage and Childbirth”</h3>
<p>— Liufeng</p>
<p>Aggressors (whether German, Japanese, or Italian) not only lack raw materials but also lack people. Although they constantly claim, “Our population is too large! Our small countries cannot hold so many people, so we have no choice but to expand abroad!”—such statements are merely a fine excuse for seizing foreign lands! Anyone who believes this is truly the biggest fool in the world.</p>
<p>I say aggressors are short of people because they always encourage their own citizens to marry and have children. In Germany, a married man supposedly finds it very easy to get a job. In Italy, giving birth to two children earns rewards; if one has three, four, or five, I imagine the Prime Minister will deliver yet another startling speech to the masses, and “special rewards” go without saying.</p>
<p>Now I hear that in Japan the director of the so‑called “Life Affairs Division” of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Takashima, has proclaimed: his goal is “six children per household in Japan.” He further states that “an agency for encouraging childbirth and for national population control will soon be established, and among the many ‘rear‑echelon plans’ proposed for national welfare in this critical period, increasing the Japanese population is the most important.” Therefore, “it is proposed that Japan follow the German and Italian example in giving state subsidies to encourage marriage and childbirth.”</p>
<p>These three aggressive countries are not only united in ideology but also seem to feel the need to “standardize” marriage and childbirth. But, to the sorrow of our “ally,” aren’t there already far too many of those “marrying and childbirth” men driven to the “continent” to engage in “heroic deeds”? These “warriors” not only waste their bullets but also, when seeing Chinese “flower girls,” waste much of their spirit. At least while they live that’s something—but once they turn into “ashes,” marriage and childbirth are out of the question! This is a grave concern for the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which points out “a conspicuous cause of the low birthrate is that since the war began in 1937, Japan has lost 500,000 men in battle.” Although this figure from the ministry is not entirely reliable, 500,000 is no small number. If these 500,000 able-bodied men could be “produced” en masse like weapons in an arms factory, the results would surely be considerable, right?</p>
<p>Second, aiming for “six children per household” as Life Affairs Division Director Takashima’s “goal” is also quite difficult. Given the rising cost of living in Japan today, the real incomes of both salaried and working classes have fallen drastically since the incident (i.e., the war). Though the state economy is very tight and subsidies to encourage marriage and childbirth have been proposed, supporting “six children” is a huge burden. Moreover, in current Japan parents must even pay several dozen yen of national debt per infant. Who would willingly increase their burden—and that of their children—by having more offspring?</p>
<p>As for so‑called “bride schools” (a bride being a new wife), even if they offer some kind of “crash course,” children must still spend ten months in the womb—that is a very long “time”! And raising a child to sixteen or seventeen to become a young soldier takes even longer!</p>
<p>“A state subsidy to encourage marriage and childbirth along the lines of Germany and Italy” can do nothing now—it will take sixteen or seventeen years to have an effect. How is that any good?</p>
<h3>A Sketch of General Zhao Tong</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yizhi</p>
<p>The young General Zhao Tong abandoned civil engineering to lead a guerrilla detachment and resist the Japanese forces. As a result, his enemies placed a 100,000‑yuan bounty on his head, yet he continued to carry it with him through every perilous mission.</p>
<p>Like an elusive shadow, General Zhao, a youthful leader of the Chinese guerrillas who constantly plagued the Japanese around the suburbs of Beiping, deftly evaded their searches and slipped out of North China. At the end of last year, this courageous young man appeared in Chongqing, the wartime capital of China, to pay his respects to Chairman Chiang and other military and political leaders, to report on guerrilla activities, and to seek their guidance.</p>
<p>General Zhao is only twenty‑seven this year, of modest height and build, and gives the impression of a gentle, diligent university student. Today, he commands tens of thousands of brave men operating in the western hills beyond Pingxi. The Chinese people hold him in high esteem; by contrast, his enemies greatly fear him.</p>
<p>One morning last October, he bade farewell to his brothers and traveled from Beiping to Chongqing. Disguised as a cabbage peddler, he passed through the city gates under the watchful eyes of Japanese military police, who searched him and then let him go. Had they recognized him as Zhao Tong, they surely would have celebrated, for his head was worth 100,000 yuan!</p>
<p>General Zhao’s men often slipped into the city aboard Japanese military trucks driven by Chinese drivers. He, however, chose a different path. Because Japanese spies were everywhere in the city, keeping close watch on this key figure, he once sought treatment for his nose at Union Hospital inside the city. There, under an assumed name, he slept in a comfortable bed for several months, and then recuperated there for another two weeks. Each day, an attractive nurse would come to his bedside to inform him of the guerrillas’ movements in the Western Hills. Little did she realize that he was their true commander.</p>
<p>When he was discharged for the fourth time, he donned a gleaming silk robe and, from a careful distance, resembled a theatrical performer. Thanks to this clever disguise, he safely reached Tianjin, from where he boarded a steamer to Shanghai, and shortly thereafter arrived in Hong Kong. Upon his arrival, his agent in Beiping sent word that, not long after he left the city, the Japanese had received intelligence on his whereabouts in Beiping. They searched the entire city and, within two or three days, arrested and interrogated many young Chinese men in hopes of discovering him among them.</p>
<p>As for the value of his head, in 1933 it was only worth 3,000 yuan, when he and a few comrades first organized the “Northeast Youth Iron‑Blood Army” in Manchuria. He had been a second‑year student at Northeastern University, studying civil engineering and planning a career in that field after graduation. Now his agent, Mr. Pan Junxi (phonetic), still leads some five thousand of his old troops in ambushes against the Japanese in the southern mountain regions of the Liaodong Peninsula, keeping the enemy constantly on the defensive.</p>
<p>In April 1936, Zhao Tong left Manchuria for Beiping. At that time, the Japanese were pressuring the Chinese authorities in North China to “self‑govern” and break away from the Central Government. He and his comrades foresaw that this would lead to conflict, so they began studying the terrain around Beiping, especially mapping out the rifles hidden among the villages, identifying key military positions, and gauging public sentiment. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Impressions of “Ride A Crooked Mile”</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>In “The New Water Margin,” Yakintay Milov’s portrayal of a straightforward, magnanimous pirate drew considerable attention. His style was reminiscent of Wallace Beery’s. Unsurprisingly, after the sensational success of “The New Water Margin,” he now stars solo in “Ride A Crooked Mile.”</p>
<p>How fitting then that in “Ride A Crooked Mile” he plays the Cossack leader McBarren, a character ideally suited to his manner! Crude yet generous, McBarren has no recollection of having married a Russian woman (Manri) twenty years ago, nor of having a twenty‑year‑old son. Yet when he learns that his son is likewise “brave, spirited,” and very much his father’s son, his paternal instincts are stirred, prompting him to “turn over a new leaf” (he is a cattle rustler who has settled in America). What a lovely character! But just as he prepares to take his son—originally named Meng Gaomao but now called John, since he disliked his given name—on a world tour, the authorities uncover evidence of his cattle thefts and he is imprisoned. John joins the U.S. Cavalry to assist his father’s escape, thinking it a sound strategy, but once the plan is under way he feels that a soldier’s duty is “to serve one’s country loyally,” and that “loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fully realized.” This story is truly moving. I introduce it because it reminds me so much of Beery’s “Companions of the Soil” and “Son of a Bandit,” and personally I have a great fondness for such films.</p>
<p>Moreover, on a higher plane, nowadays we should encourage those sons who denounce their criminal fathers, like “the sheep‑thief’s son who reports his father.”</p>
<p>As for the staging of “Ride A Crooked Mile,” the director crafted Milov’s character with exceptional care, especially in the first half. Scenes like: at the cattle ranch, his men inform him that a woman wishes to see him; the meeting with his wife; the encounter with his son; the father‑son sparring; the trial of the horses—through these many scenes, McBarren’s character is developed with remarkable precision and a great sense of humor. Take the horse‑testing scene: (1) the father vaults onto a horse; (2) as if unskilled, the son lies low on the horse’s back; (3) McBarren spurs his mount off at speed, showing his riding skills; (4) seeing his father disappear in the distance, the son leaps down, leaps onto another fierce horse, catches up, and displays all kinds of equestrian tricks. Not only is it entertaining, but the son’s character also emerges clearly.</p>
<p>The introduction of the Russian woman, Trina, also reveals the director’s cleverness. Having first depicted the horseriding trial, the director repeats her singing voice while the father and son rest, thus orchestrating the meeting between John and Trina. Later, at the banquet, when Trina stands to sing, John immediately joins in with a stirring Cossack song—the transition is tight and cohesive. In the second half, because the narrative alternates between McBarren’s imprisonment and John’s service in the U.S. Cavalry, it inevitably slackens a bit. But the scene in the cellar where McBarren escapes prison and John is sent to capture him remains strong. When McBarren finally says, “Now we’re enemies!” and knocks his son unconscious with a punch before fleeing, the natural flow of father and son’s natures is still deeply moving.</p>
<p>“Ride A Crooked Mile” may be a supporting feature, but compared with last issue’s “The Black Umbrella Bandit” or other frivolous song‑and‑dance pieces, it is by no means unworthy.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Turns Blue</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Illusion or Reality—Life Is a Stage; Knowing When to Advance and When to Halt, Everywhere Is Home</p>
<p>Mrs. Suliya, upon hearing this, immediately agreed to donate ten transport trucks for use in China as quickly as possible. On another occasion, a female friend of hers in Northwest China—possibly associated with the Eighth Route Army—reported a shortage of medical supplies, and she personally donated $10,000 worth of medicines. She has made many such donations. Now she has proclaimed a grand vow: “Any profits earned in China shall benefit China. I do not wish to extract Chinese money and take it back to America, for I already have ample wealth, and so does America.” Jin Danyun heard her say this in person, and Mrs. Suliya spoke highly of Jin Danyun, even inviting him to serve as her consultant. On this trip to China, her investments hinged on two ventures, both inspired by her previous donations. One was the establishment of an automobile manufacturing plant; the other, the founding of a pharmaceutical company. Reflecting on the prewar era, when China could not build its own cars and had to import every vehicle—imports that numbered a truly significant amount each year—Mrs. Suliya realized that as roads multiplied, so did the need for vehicles, yet domestic production was nonexistent. Building more highways simply meant more sales for foreign manufacturers. Even wartime needs for trucks to transport the wounded were met with shortages. After the war, several Chinese automobile companies sprang up. This new auto plant was set up by Mrs. Suliya in partnership with several Chinese friends, with total capital of ten million yuan, half of which Mrs. Suliya provided. In the past, foreign‑run businesses in China were often labeled by nationality—American firms as “American Commercial” or British as “British Commercial”—but such designations are now obsolete. Except for a few industries that the state must manage as national enterprises, all private and civilian businesses, regardless of the proprietor’s nationality or capital, are free to operate under Chinese protection, making national labels unnecessary. Mrs. Suliya’s automobile plant focuses exclusively on producing new‑model public vehicles, not private carriages for leisurely personal use. In recent years, as cars have found ever‑wider applications, almost every field requires motor vehicles. (94)</p>

<h3>Anglo‑Prussian Marriage</h3>
<p>(From the April issue of the 11th year of Tongzhi of Late Qing)</p>
<p>Britain and Prussia are indeed nations united by marriage. The Prussian Crown Prince married the eldest princess of the current King of England more than ten years ago. Their harmony is as perfect as lacquer and glue. During the Franco‑Prussian War, wounded soldiers from the battlefields were admitted to the Military Medical Bureau for treatment, where the Crown Princess personally visited them and even prescribed decoctions and medicines. The soldiers, moved by gratitude, pledged their loyalty without hesitation, willing to sacrifice themselves. The kingdom extolled her as the Wise Princess, celebrating the Crown Prince’s good fortune in having such a capable consort. Now, Princess Charlotte, the daughter of Prince Charles of Prussia, has come of age—her beauty rivals jade and her countenance outshines snow. The King of England plans to marry her to his second prince, the same young prince who once toured Hong Kong and Shanghai. Recently, the King himself visited Berlin, the Prussian capital, likely for this purpose. This truly cements the friendship of the two nations and promises a century of harmony.</p>
<h3>Students of the Western Studies Institute Pay Courtesy Call on the American Consul</h3>
<p>The students of the Western Studies Institute are scheduled to depart for the United States on the eighth of this month. Early the day before, they all went to the American consulate to pay their respects to the consul. Over forty sedan chairs from the institute halted outside the consulate. The students alighted and, accompanied by escorting officials including Justice Ministry Director Chen Lanbin, filed in single file, wearing dignified hats and footwear. They dressed in black gauze‑collared robes with open fronts, belts with hooks at their waists, straw hats and pointed boots, pouches and fans at their sides—fresh, neat, and impressive, clearly future talents in administration and strategy. Once inside the hall, they stood in rows, two abreast, presenting an orderly scene like egret lines or phoenix ranks. The American consul, his countenance bright, received them with warm words of encouragement. In essence, he said: “You students, born and raised in China, are traveling far overseas to master the ways of Westerners. This unprecedented undertaking also attests to the Qing Emperor’s dedicated governance reforms, opening a new chapter in a thousand years of history…” The students sat in a circle, listening with joyful expressions. When he finished speaking, they bowed and withdrew. They then proceeded to the circuit intendant’s office to pay their respects; the circuit intendant’s exhortations of encouragement were much the same as those of the American consul.</p>
