<h3>近衛之意念</h3>
<p>理智與感情，乃人類本能之兩面；二者相處如連環，既無法分離，亦無法盡合；各有其佔領之空間，而所佔空間之消長大小，則輒因人因時因事而殊。如言和戰：和平乃文明人類之當然願望，亦一切戰爭之當然歸宿，此是普通理智，亦即一般常識；而不在高深思想，偉大政策，奧妙法術等類領域範圍之內者也。戰爭以破壞為其本質，故必苦痛慘酷，而厭惡戰爭乃為文明人類之常情；及至國族危急存亡之秋，則又以敵愾同仇，慷慨赴戰為常情。能戰，以智為基本；好戰，則違反常識常情矣。</p>
<p>中國為禦侮圖存而抗戰，不得不戰，原非好戰。及抗戰兩年有餘而至今日，謀和之說，漸見複雜，此其內在之基礎，實由理智與感情交織而成，徒以理智感情二者非但未能盡合，抑且因人而懸殊其二者所佔之空間，於是其說遂複雜。吾人茲不必列舉歷來國民黨與國民政府暨軍事領袖，以及近日如張羣王寵惠郭泰祺諸氏，先後昭告中外者，中國必如何始可言和；以此與近頃主和之論，互相對比，以求其差，以見其雜。然以和戰之為國族千百年大事，非使複雜者歸於純一，決非國族之福，而終於無成，是可斷言也。求純一，必須各自捐棄雜念，肅淸客氣，恢復其自身皎潔之眞誠；必須毀除「顏色眼鏡」，必須體認愛國救國為瀰漫於任何人心坎之正氣；總之，除高昂之民族情緒而外，儘量約束感情，整理理智，而後可望歸於純一。吾則，不但不得純一，且因相激相盪而愈趨複雜。抑整理理智，談何容易；有為感情而理智喪失殆盡者，有為感情而敝屣理智者，有畜意歪曲其理智者，有為理智不足而不自知其陷於歪曲者。檢視和戰之論，輒多所未安，於是知整理理智，建樹純一之輿情為至難也。就所未安，逐一加以研討，此於理智為必要，然研討亦必以言者聞者平心靜氣為前提；吾則，理智之研討反而助長感情之激盪；南轅北轍，是可以已。</p>
<p>雖然，有一端焉，可作最根本最簡明之檢討者；中國謀和之說，於其內在之基礎而外，有其外來之原因焉，即去年十二月二十二日日本首相近衛之聲明，在中國引起懸殊之反應；主和者，以近衛聲明為議和之圭臬。茲不問關於近衛聲明正反兩面之反應，孰短孰長，孰是孰非；不問近衛聲明根本在日本國策上之地位如何，對於日本軍人政客之拘束力如何；不問根據近衛聲明而中國遽爾放棄抗戰之危險性如何。要之，正面應響近衛聲明者，深信此項聲明乃以「中日平等互惠為基本原則」深信於所聲明之日本對中國「無領土之要求，無軍費賠償之要求，無經濟獨佔之要求，尊重中國之主權，尊重中國之獨立完整」。茲不問近衛聲明是吾如此明確，凡此所標舉，是吾可恃；亦不問此外所謂共同反共與經濟合作，如何與主權獨立云云絕不牴牾。夫所謂深信者，為理智之判斷乎？非有感情參雜乎？抑絕大部分之感情為之主宰乎？祟尚理智，則非事實證明，初未宜遽爾深信。詎知事實邈然，而近衛又於聲明之後，為文補充矣：他不備論，其間說明侵略者，日「故興膺懲之師，出向中國大陸。」其間於「不要求領土」「尊重中國完整」之中，則稱「中日滿三國……善鄰友好。」其間於「尊重中國主權」之中，則稱「中國有中國之傳統，有中國之習慣，允以自治為彼等之長處，故大體上將責任委諸中國國民：其過份干涉之事，將嚴予注意。」凡此云云，甚可以理智判斷近衛之意念，蓋與中國主和之說，大相徑庭，固顯而易見者也。由戰而和，勢所必至，事所當然；至於可和之道，雖見仁見智，未能盡同，然如近衛論文所述，則在理智檢討之下，宜必共認為未妥歟！</p>

<h3>戰時歐洲進行曲　倫敦特約通信　叔棣</h3>
<p>（一）宣傳戰</p>
<p>「蘇德互不侵犯協定」才告簽定，歐洲的國際形勢，立刻受到了一個非常重大的震撼；外交的視聽上，就不得不起了一陣大大的迷亂。隨着而來現身於歐洲國際舞台上的，是：猜疑，憂慮，恐慌，及捉摸不定。於是，在這種紛亂的環境裹，就產生了各種各式的謠言，加上各方面別有作用的宣傳。很顯然，德國宣傳部長戈培爾指揮下的各種機構，又多了一個嶄新的活動園地。蘇聯方面，坐鎭凱木林宮的斯太林，一面默默地吸着他的著名烟斗，做出非常沉默的姿態：但另一面，站在蘇聯和第三國際立塲上說着話的機關，幾幾乎，是遍佈全世界的所有角落。號稱民主國家軸心的英，法，宣傳的陣容上，却很整齊地，擁出了幾員大將；英國路透社，法國哈瓦斯社，再加上美國方面的幾個新聞社，遙遙地，在助着聲威。自然，在表面上，這些社全是民辦事業，但即使在平時，巳經是「半官性質」，何况在這個年月？</p>
<p>緊張而尖銳的外交競賽，剛剛跑完了這一個圈子。這一次的結果是：蘇，德，兩國的外交，首先達到了終點；被遠遠拋在後面去的，是英國張伯倫內閣路錢的外交。那末，在這一條跑道上，競賽已經結束，沒有急起直追的人了麼？並不然。祇要我們再仔細地向遠遠的那面，去眺望一下，那末，我們立刻就可以看到正在力竭聲嘶而衝上前來的，還有：（一）法國達拉第的所謂「絕對不再讓步」。（二）英國邱吉爾，艾登，哈立法克斯，等人的所謂「粉碎强力政治」。（三）波蘭的柏克外長，也在那裏跑着，但一面跑，却一面不住地運疑一兩步；還時不時要掉轉頭去，和墨索里尼招呼一下。（四）意　利的墨索里尼，這一回，也參加了競賽。然而他主要目的，却在促成希特拉的獲勝。他的主要任務：首先勸別人不必再跑，徒勞無功；其次是，大驚小怪地吆喝一兩聲，擾亂參加者與觀衆的視綫；最後如遇必要，大概就打算仿照運動塲上無賴之徙的作風，向跑道上一躺，絆別的參加者大大的摔上一交，讓希特拉取得勝利。美國的羅斯福大總統，這一次，並沒有加入，僅僅在一旁，大懿地吶喊着，當了英，法，選手的啦啦隊。——這一比喻，就是近些天來歐洲列國外交競賽的簡明縮影。</p>
<p>在這幅外交圖書的背面，却是各國為了未來戰事的大批動員。有人估計，歐洲今天動員的總數，在一千萬以上。而實在的數目呢，却何止這些！如果把非戰鬥的直接參加戰事的人員，也計算在內，那末，那數目，最少也要在一萬萬以上！眼前的例子，不妨舉出倫敦。為了戰事而動員起來的，積極和消極防衛人員，至少也在五十萬以上吧。廣義地說，為了未來的大戰，歐洲是整個的動員了。確確　實的所謂「總動員！」</p>
<p>可是比起外交和軍事來，這些天，在歐洲表面上，開得最起勁的，却是各國的宜傳戰。</p>
<p>蘇德協定簽定後，在歐洲對於牠的內容，那說法，至少在一百種以上！至於一涉及牠的可能影響，那紛歧的　度，還要遠過於這個數目！</p>
<p>舉例來說。據一般有眼光有識見的觀察家們共同一致的推斷，在蘇德這一次協定裏，附帶了兩國間，無論如何，留下一條緩衝地帶的消息，是可靠的。英法兩國當局和新聞輿論界人士們，對這，是十二分地明瞭；但一出現在口頭和筆下時，却成了「蘇聯和德國，同意瓜分波蘭！」</p>
<p>又比如，蘇德這一次協定，明明白白，是針對着英國「張伯倫內閣路綫一挑撥德蘇之間的戰爭。這一次協定的談判，已經並非一朝一夕，英國一般有識見的人，早就回他們政府，警告過牠的成功的可能。牠的用意呢，毫無疑義的，是建立起彼此之間的緩衝。可是英法的宣傳機關，一說起時，却是乾脆的：「蘇德已經結了同盟！」</p>
<p>蘇德「同盟」是可能的麼？牠們之開，會成立「瓜分」波蘭的默契麼？（未完）</p>

<h3>歐戰爆發前　愛拉立三國的局勢（續）</h3>
<p>— 倫敦泰晤士報　伯明譯</p>
<p>兩國對於蘇聯所提保證他們被攻擊時給予援助的建議、認為是與中立政策相牴觸的、因為德國要解釋兩國此舉是加入」和平陣綫」、就是德國所稱的「包圍」的、若英法蘇在任何國家（不指定是波羅的海諸國）被侵略而乞援時予以援手、那末、波，羅的海諸國不致提起反對、然而他們認為蘇聯建議的保證、是挑釁舉動、而主張波羅的海諸國的安全、只是蘇聯的政策、覓取與兩國利益相牴觸的若干裨益的託詞而已、蘇聯自承恐怕德國或將在拉國與愛國登陸、然後進攻蘇聯、但已往三年間、紅軍巳在此前絕不設防的全部邊界一帶造成了據稱是堅不可拔的「蘇維埃馬奇諾防綫」、「波羅的海諸國」一辭、還包括組成波羅的海協商的第三個小共和國立陶宛在內、立陶宛人和拉特維亞人同樣是印度歐羅巴血流、而愛托尼亞人却和芬蘭人同種、立國和德國有通常的陸地邊界、而另一面却不和蘇聯接壤、這點和愛拉兩國不同、所以並不包括在蘇聯的保證建讓之內、愛拉兩國在他們生存的二十年間、並沒和任何鄰國起紛爭、然而立國比較不幸、直到近來、還因維爾納與波蘭失歡、因米美爾與德國不和、愛拉兩國、在一九二〇年後、不久便成立聯盟、然而立國却因這些紛爭、到一九三四年才加入、而成立三國波羅的海協商、立國對於維爾納和米美爾的爭執、明白地除出在這協商的範圍之外、所以立國迫不得已、解決此等問題時、是孤立着的、但是目前再無此種性質的「特殊問題」了、此三共和國現藉協商聯繫着、對外界表示共同陣綫、然而近在柏林簽訂互不侵犯協定、立國並不在塲、因為三月間立國割讓米美爾、而與德國締結的條約中、已將該國的互不侵犯協定包括在內了、</p>
<p>此三共和國都巳分別和集體的宣佈在鄰國作戰時、他們將守中立、僅將為防衛自己的獨立而戰、三國將一起對最先破壞他們中立的國家作戰、然而三國不願預言將吾接受外來的援助、因為三國認定這種假定的佈置、都和他們的嚴格中立相牴觸的、</p>
<p>波羅的海諸國獨自不能對德或對蘇作多大抵抗、然而仟何國家的軍隊、其主力重兵在另一方面作戰的、對三國聯軍不能不加重視、三國的人口共的五百五十萬人、（愛國一百十三萬一千人、拉國二百萬人、立國二百十萬人、）常備軍六萬人、（愛國一萬二千名、拉國二萬五千名、立國二萬三千名、）三協商國遍境實施普世採用的强迫兵役制、其陸軍能迅速地擴充至五十萬人、軍隊受過優良的訓練、許多士官已在海外獲得補充的經騐、而組織優良的輔助團體、幾乎可將三共和國立刻改變成三個武裝國家、</p>
<p>三國的人類品質優秀、較年長的後備兵中、有許多是在十餘歲時就跟他們的父親和祖父並肩作戰、這二十年前的戰爭、使他們得到獨立、還從此得到自己的地區、而在那裹建立自己的家庭、這些家庭若遭侵略或威脅、那末、他們現在既得服裝豐美、訓練和設備優良之便、至少也會像跟着他們的祖父在沒有自己的土地足資防禦時一樣地作戰、今日的三國總統、愛國的派慈、拉國的烏爾曼紐、和立國的史美多那、管理着他們的共和國、渡過近來的憲法改革期間的、便是二十年前領導國民進入獨立的第一階級的人、</p>

<p>教育消息</p>

<h3>英法德國戰爭經濟力比較觀</h3>
<p>— 南柔</p>
<p>宜傳了多年的二次大戰，終於在一個月前成為悲慘的現實而登台了。這終於降臨的大戰的結果怎樣？是誰都急切想知道的問題。</p>
<p>但是要預測這次歐戰的結果，第一個前提條件是交戰國的範圍。義大利的中立究竟能維持多久？以及蘇聯的態度，美國的動向，巴爾幹諸國的向背，英法殖民地的去就等等，都還沒有明瞭。如果將來交戰國雙方各自聯合其他國家而成的兩個對立的集團，其勢力過於不平衡時，戰爭的結果很易於判斷，但是兩方面勢均力敵的話，戰爭的期間和規模就必然地會延長和擴大了。這點既還是未知數，耍作客觀的判斷的材料不能不說是極缺少。</p>
<p>放過上面的條件不說，且說第二個前提條件，那就是須先知道戰爭的期間問題，即短期戰還是長期戰？這問題在比較雙方戰爭經濟力上，是較第一個前提更為重要的因素。僅就這點說來，因為近代戰爭的特質是需要較量交戰國國民經濟力與精神力至最後一滴為止的所謂長期戰，所以這次大戰是吾也會像上次大戰那麼繼續四年，或四年以上，雖然是不能預知的事，但是據目下的情勢看來，長期化是必然的趨努吧。</p>
<p>旣然認定這次大戰有化為長期戰的必然性，我們就須以這事作為立論的出發點，來試行比較英法和德國的戰爭經濟力。不過須要注意的是，下面所述的祇是若干指標而已，將會因中立國的行動如何而再展開新的視野。</p>
<p>先就戰爭準備的經濟體制說。關於這點，德國的國防經濟充實的體制，似乎比民主主義國英法的體制耍堅强一點。同然，德國因為經濟上的關係而希望「速戰速决」，是不可掩的事實，不過至少在戰爭準備的經濟體制方面，的確是久已努力着應付長期戰的所謂長期國防經濟體制的樹立的。例如關於戰爭經濟的各種教　上和行政上的措施，都早已着手進行；勞務動員，經濟武裝，以及經濟的細胞組織化與團體組織化，也已相當地成功；就是關於工業動員，其由工業中心地的分散，由國境撤向腹地等，也已着手進行了。而最重要的事，是顧慮戰時的陷於孤立，所以盡可能地設法减少食糧與原料的對外依賴性，努力保持戰時輸出貿易而訂結戰時通商關係等，這些方面都盡了不少的力。以一九三六年開始的所謂「新四年計劃」，很明白地是其集中的表現。在其政策的底裹所藏着的基本原則，便是想竭力不要再犯首次大戰時的失敗。</p>
<p>反觀英法方面怎麼樣？固然英國自以通過了一九三六年度的龐大的國防費以來，關於經濟方面的戰爭準備，也的確講求着種種措施了。只是其措施的方法，始終站在和平經濟的基礎上，對於「置產業於戰時體制下」這事，政界和民界始終表示反對的。但是鑒於危機的緊迫，於八月二十四日在國會中通過的「國防全權法」，是將戰時經濟的運用全權委諸政府的重要法律，足和德國的全權委任立法相匹敵，只是等到英國紳士拋了洋傘跨這樣的巨步，離宣戰已僅僅十天吧了。</p>
<p>法國也是從　年前起，才急激地進入準備戰時體制，去年七月制定了劃期的「國家總動員法，」以備一旦戰事發生。但是法國政局的慢性的不安，對於產業組織的戰時編成上也投了多大的陰翳，戰爭經濟潛力的積蓄沒有多大的進步。</p>
<p>其次，說食糧和原料等的戰時自給率，道是戰爭與經濟的結合上最重要的問題。當眞說起來，僅僅要以國內生產來支持長期戰，英法德任何一國都不可能；雖然有程度上之差，總之都須有賴於國外的補充的。所以不妨這樣說一句：在長期戰爭之下，誰能够確保其國外食糧和原料等的供給路錢，誰就佔勝利。</p>
<p>德國的食糧的自給率，由於希特勒的努力增產，近年來有了不少的進步，那倒是不能吾認的，同時貯藏政策也相當普遍地進行着；但是有關軍需原料的石油等重要鈹物資源的不足，却也是無可諱言的弱點。因此，竭力奉承蘇聯，要想依賴蘇聯的穀倉，鑛層及油田，母寗是常然的趨勢。同樣，英法也必須依賴其海外殖民地供給；傷英國這樣，要是沒有殖民地接濟食糧與原料，恐怕連幾個月的戰爭經濟也維持不了吧？所以努力確保其海上運輸路綫，成了戰時絕對重要的金科玉律。</p>
<p>在食糧和原料的補充上，英法具有德國所不能及的强點，是他們有多額的現金和匯兌準備。有人把他作為英法勝利的根據，置在現金與匯兌準備較德國佔絕對優勢的事實上，這雖然不免近於偏激；但是黃金在戰時的效能，也的確不可輕視。所謂「有錢能使鬼推磨，」這話在相當範圍以內照樣可以適用於戰爭，因為現金保有額較高的國家，在緊急時可以多得第三國的物資的供給而致戰爭於有利。特別是以「窮」聞名於世的現在的德國，雖然納粹代言者宣傳他們有「秘密的」戰爭準備金貯藏着，但是無論怎樣，德國的現金和匯兌準備遠遜於英法，是不可文飾的事實。倘使拋開別的條件不說，僅從這點看，則德國畢竟不是英法的對手。</p>
<p>不過看了戰事發生後雙方所取的緊措施急，而就將牠作為戰爭經濟力的測量器，是不能把握住眞實的辦法。例如這次戰事一發生，德國便迅速實施主要食品的定量分配，有人看到這事，馬上直覺地認為食糧疲乏，這是不適當的。因為這祗能認為憑着上次大戰中的經騐，和平時研究和準備的戰時計割經濟付諸實施吧了。</p>
<p>但是就開戰至今的一個多月的情形說，德國是不利於長期戰，英法則在長期戰中處於有利的地位。而依照近代戰爭的特徵，有着走入長期戰的必然的命運，這樣，邏輯地推論起來，這次大戰德國畢竟沒有勝算。這自然是僅僅根據目下的情勢而作的推論。不過將來即使中立國家的態度發生變化，只耍援助英法的集團的勢力不比援助德國的弱，同時又能確保其和聯絡國及殖民地間的運輸路錢，則英法定必具有勝利的把握；何况因為戰局的推移，德國更有獨裁國特有的內部崩潰的危險呢！</p>
<h3>美棉合華幣價</h3>
<p>張方仁先生：垂詢美棉印棉價折合華幣之來函，刻到館時收悉。爰先就美棉折算法一項簡答如次，餘於下期詳述。</p>
<p>（一）　美棉呌價單位為磅及美分，故應一方將美金化為國幣，一方應將磅化為市担，算式為</p>
<p>（二）　閣下以十八日之十月美棉價九分一厘二，化合後與同日新聞報所載之折合國幣不符，懷疑該報所載者或包刮運費及關稅等加費在內。因閣下所羅之上項市價，與同日之本報及新聞報所載不符，故無從核對。惟依上列計算方式折算結果，與新聞報所載者確有不符。因其差數不遠，可知該報所載之折合價，並不包刮加費在內。而其所以發生差數，或山於彼此計算時所根據之美滙率或有不同歟？</p>
<p>據二十一日新聞報（因該報咋日，並無折合便）所載十九日美棉現貨價九分二厘八，及二十日上海對美匯率晚收價七元五九三七五合國幣百元（即美金一元合國幣十三元一角六分九厘）計算，則每市祖美棉價合國幣一百三十四元六角七分，與該報當日所載之折合價一百三十一元八角，確有不符，茲以發排忽忽，而記者又寡聞，容於下期本刊委請專家詳復。</p>

<h3>過去一週</h3>
<p>投機家的地位愈糟。拿本週首尾兩天行市比較：買英匯的每鎊至少虧一元七角半買美金的每元至少虧六角。如果買的不是滙票而是外幣，每個單位便至少虧一元至三元以上。此外如買現金的每條至少虧六十元左右；囤　紗的，每包二十支雙馬至少虧五十二元；每擔通州花至少虧四五元。多頭陣容，已一敗塗地。可是買公債的，却都賺錢。像戊便漲起七角，在高低峯間且有一元以上的差利可得。旣得愛國的美名，還有錢賺！再好沒有！回顧戰事發生以來，在投機界，惟有債市比較最平穩。理由多到不可勝數，而多頭非做到底不可，也是其中主要理由之一。唯其如此，內債市塲便成爲最妥當最可靠的投資之所！</p>
<p>英法土簽定「互助恊定」之後，蘇土間互電聯歡。這或許又是蘇聯得擺脫歐局糾紛的另一個新因素吧？荷京曾傳蒙「滿」間日蘇又起衝突，雖未證實，但至少可以配合上述的猜測。而駐日美使格魯的演詞，美國務卿赫爾對上海租界的仗義執言與提供實力援助的諾言，更使遠東局面明朗。同時華軍在各綫上的英勇挺進，捷報頻傳，以及日方濫放和平　言，想作金蟬脫壳之計。諸如此類，無一不使市塲人心興奮而且堅定！所以懸測今週的市氣將更人佳境！（須予）</p>
<p>上海自二十七年上半期以後，物價逐漸增貴，最近物價增貴則更甚，人民生活感到萬分困難。近幾天來，物價有回跌勢。這是因爲今次歐戰與上次大戰，無論在時間空間方面，都不相同。洋貨的來源並沒有斷絕，就是自佔據區運來的物品，也並不如意想的那樣困難，所以理論上物價只有一天天的下落；可是一般投機者對囤貨尙不肯脫售，想等待好機會。但，稍爲一想，上漲的時期已成過去，再也不能實現投機的黃金夢。更要知道，物價超過人民購買力多多，一輩子不會有銷路的！（一粟）</p>
<p>歐戰啟幕後，交戰國對華貿易，大受打擊，輸入銳减，九月份滬海關進口額四八·八一六·九一六元，出口額六六·七一一·〇八〇元，由入超而變爲出超，是整個國家貿易好轉的現象，是復興國族莫大的助力，今後將消耗性的舶來品，儘量摒絕不用，同時努力生產以增進出口，前途必更樂觀！（王逹斐）</p>
<h3>答陳郅民先生</h3>
<p>— 潘傳棟</p>
<p>（一）來函所謂用意何在一點，鄙意以為大著一方謂經營定期交易最能獲利，同時後半部說明作法，似意在指示投機方法。鄙意以為經營定期交易，非最能獲利之法，乃為便利工商業避免價格上落危險之方法。工商業預計原料或商品數量，預購或預售於市塲，以避免日後市價之不利變動，此為投機目的之一。或欲日後賣出商品，而事先拋出標準品，日後賣現貨時，再行補進。如此投機市塲上之損益，與現貨賣出時損益相銷，以避免市價之不利變動，此為投機目的之二，亦為最重要之目的。茲不贅引事實。因此吾國法律規定交易所設立必須由同業發起，金交經紀人且須為公會會員，即經營定期生意，乃為同業便利起見，非為外界致富方法。</p>
<p>同時即或認為買空賣空可為最能獲利之事業，但竊以為大著所指示之方法不甚充分且不甚完備。大著後部所述買賣方法，鄙人認為係為指示而作。蓋如為叙述買賣單位及計算價格昇降，則不知叙述買賣之成數及次序。但大著所指示之方法，不知何意。因一般投機專業者必已知此種方法。若用以為指導外界之用則似有危險。鄙人即恐外界依所示之方法而投機，故加以辯明。現在投機既甚流行，無論如何，其中必有不甚明瞭投機之要件。（投機商或經紀人自不在內）。故以為指示投機方法之著作，有被誤用之危險。閣下本意必非欲使人誤用。但不一定能保證其不被誤用。故鄙人即在閘明大著不能為投機之藍本。鄙人用意，即在於此。似非信口雌黃。不知閣下以為依照大著能吾投機？如不能投機，而仍須其他智識經騐，即無異謂，『本書所述之方法，為投機方法。但亦不能依此投機之方法，而仍需視汝財智個性而決定」。夫詳細叙述各種物品投機之方法，而又謂不能應用此種方法投機，豈非自相矛盾。鄙意以為閣下欲闡明投機之性質，自應叙述交易所之組織，其利益，及買賣人經紀人之地位職務。而應避免投機方法之具體的叙述。若閣下欲闈明投機之方法，亦應將劃綫及各種物品投機時可得之統計，（如買賣外股之陶瓊司平均數各外國經紀人所印送之書籍刋物）等加以說明。似亦應避免具體之方法。蓋避免為人誤用也。今大著所示之方法，既極具體，又未聲明其不能實用，則何以避免為人誤用？且如謂依大著保守之法一節內之言，已聲明不能應用，則著書之意，又何以自解？</p>
<p>（二）所引證者，謂投機必須財力智力。此言似非理論，而為事實。復函已承認。此言似未可因引證他人之言而廢。且鄙人未謂理論與事實可吻合。故曾云有財力智力（即理論），尚須有經騐（即事實），始能運用之而成功。故非謂專科畢業，即可投機。事實上專科畢業者，常不投機，因知其失敗之危險也。一笑。</p>
<p>（三）對於具有宏富經騐之專業如閣下者，鄙人絕無絲毫輕視之念，反之深為景仰。但專家所作指示投機之書，其理論愈近事實，則鄙人愈不敢贊同，因投機殆非文字可指示之事業故也。</p>
<p>（四）作制兩字或節制兩字，實以寡聞，未悉其義。不知是吾謂以證余買賣之義。但鄙人不注意於肚種片言隻字。即如大著雖有、須同以熟悉者論」等語，但鄙人以為大著係指示投機之書。（吾則閣下著書之義難於解釋）。而妄肆「雌黃」者，亦即在此。</p>
<p>（五）其他各點，復函既不述及，自亦無庸再述。總之鄙人之意，以為一般無專識者之投機對個人社會均無利益。而大著為指示投機之書籍，有被外界誤用，以之為投機方法則危險。此言當否，任諸公論及閣下之考慮。非吾定此言之答覆，此後恕不再辯。（却酬）</p>

<p>兩性衛生</p>
<h3>有關人生幸福的</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>生育原理與衛生</p>
<p>欲澈底了解生育原理的起源，轉變，以及其中的機械作用，非先明瞭其於腦中樞之結構連絡不為功。腦中樞位於人之腦中。藉傳入與傳出神經，與性神經脊中樞連絡，間接支配局部之活動，外則與視聽之機能相連通，此所以視美女，聽靡聲，皆足以引起衝動，所幸者，吾人因精力腦力，常集中於日常生活，以致生理之反射及衝動，常被潛伏於半意識中，而不能現其活動，惟飽食暖衣，無所事事，及心思有及於邪淫時，而此衝動始得現於意識界中，故淸心寡慾，此為節慾義生之道也。</p>
<p>靑年因意志之薄弱，常為淫書淫畫所惑，每犯自凟惡癖，因而神經紊亂，體力亦減，遺精滑精，神經衰弱，然有一法，可推為科學上合理之原則，能以節制生育妄動者，卽古人所謂之修身，正心，誠意是也，實施方法，可常令心思顧慮於最有興趣之事業，因與趣所致，則精神腦力自歸之，如是則生殖慾衝動，庶可潛伏於半意識中，既不勞其身，亦不擾其神。</p>
<p>生殖學本於愛情有關，故此慾望必須雙方協調，然縱慾自凟之結果，往往腎虧而早衰，故宜增精補腎，如能極時補以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」卽可達到增精補腎之目的，以余臨床之經驗所知，「補體康」確有根治腎　挽救早袞之功，年老人服之，允具培補之功，市上雖有類如之補劑，完全距吾輩醫師之理想甚遠，且有多種甚不合格之成分，允出於吾人意料之外，惟「補體康」一藥，為中外醫師所推崇，共女用者，有調經種子，治療貧血之功。凡女子面部皺痕叢生，乳癟毫無曲線，一服女用「補體康」之後，立能增進健美，其成分完全採取雌性動物之卵巢內分泌，成分的確可靠。故敢介紹病家。</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>淋病擇藥秘訣</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃梅仲昌醫師</p>
<p>淋病患者，無時不感到擇藥時之徬徨無措者。蓋一朝誤治，後息無窮，急性者化為慢性，慢性者又多續發睪丸炎，攝護腺炎等之合併症。絕嗣滅育，身體殘廢，深可震駭也。夫淋病之治療界，自透膜殺菌療法宣告失敗之後，而一般化學療法，又多名不符實，不能奏到吾人理想上的功效。無甚珍貴的成績；可供吾人臨床上之使用：乃埋頭研究，不知費盡多少心血，幸由利耳珂禾氏，及林那塞氏等，發見淋病之自動性免疫療法，卽用蛋白體注射於人體內，以昂盛患者之抗淋毒素，使體內產生多量之血球，以撲滅潛伏內部之淋菌，其法已得全球醫家所公認。及德國彼德博士出，乃於百尺竿頭再進一步，最新科學方法，提出蛋白體黃色素，製成淋病內服藥「克淋儂」，經過多次之動物試騐，確實證明此為淋病特效藥，且無任何之副作用。</p>
<p>淋病患者，對於治療方法，必須特別留意，允其擇藥方面，不可疏忽，蓋必須選擇毫無副作用而具有特效藥之藥品，且還要有世界著名醫家所賞用，「克淋儂」一藥，久為歐美醫家所贊賞，各大花柳病雜誌中，對「克淋儂」亦恒有論文推薦。苟非「克淋儂」功效之卓特，曷能臻此，歐美各國淋病患者，自「克淋儂」一藥發明後，採作為家庭自療者，獲有最優異之成績，故得廣大之信心；此足為淋病擇藥者之眞確捷徑！</p>
<h3>最新治肺良藥</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>對於肺病的治療，各國醫家雖有發明。而結核病之勢力，迄有增無已。良以藥治有特效者鮮，通常所習用之藥物，雖亦能奏功於一時，惟無絕對之功效，以是醫家病家。莫不苦之，惟有用沃度及石灰質等組成之藥，有改善體質與治療機轉之作用而具强大之殺菌力也「補肺盒爾」一藥，根據上述原理發明製成，本品對於肺病，奏功確實，凡咯血咯痰，咳嗽氣急，胸部隱痛，血痰混濁，食慾减退，潮熱盜汗，顏面蒼白，身體削瘦等，服之無不奇騐，以其能塡補石灰質，而使肺中空洞愈合，故不論一二三期肺病，服之皆有卓效。</p>
<h3>遺精者　沒有結婚的本能</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭</p>
<p>有患者邱子良者，浙江海門人，現年二十五歲（自訴）十穴歲時求學於某中學，因受同宿舍同學之引誘而犯自凟之惡習，此時年幼無知，竟每日玩之，頗覺興味，一年後，亦並無任何症狀發生，但時覺頭痛而已，一日，忽於某種雜誌上看到手淫影響靑年發育之標題，閱讀之後，乃恍然大悟，雖決心除之，而終未能戒絕，二月後卽發生遺精，而身體已衰弱不堪，去年奉父母之命結婚，事前會服補劑十多瓶，而結婚之後，房事僅能支持半分鐘，有竟近女性肉體，卽已洩精，而此外尚有失眠健忘，腰酸背痛等症，今特來函，伏求各大醫師設法醫治……（治愈經過）邱君之疾乃由手淫遺精而起，當由鞏固精關及培補虧損兩方並進，乃令其進服「耐而斯遺精片」及「補體康」兩藥，並嚴守攝生，邱君尊言而行，一月後，精神大振，失眠已無，再服二月，腎强而精足，絕無早洩情事，並體重增加十磅。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<h3>淋濁纏綿的新療法</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>能在未入慢性淋時治療最為上策，</p>
<p>既入慢性必須注意全盤有效療法，</p>
<p>淋病是一種難於處理之花柳病，因為淋毒之病原菌——卽雙球菌具有十分頑强之善戰本能，又能匿藏深奧之所在，故淋病患者大多纏綿難愈。所以要用某一種療法還是在急性淋時期，但不是說急性淋病一旦過去，而說俊性淋濁纏綿的症狀，卽說無法醫治。治療淋病之實際責任，為如何可以防止淋菌之侵入，既經深入，如何可以用迅速方法撲滅之。以斷絕其繁殖，故作負隅之困鬥，以消耗病人體力。</p>
<p>療治淋病，以方法決其　敗，為淋病是否能愈之生死關頭。以一般而論，此病宜先用精細診斷，偵查病根所在，然後下藥，始免價事。故醫家在診斷淋病時，幸勿以「老馬識途」自命，而仍須仔細診斷治療。</p>
<p>但治療淋毒，必須用全盤療法，使淋菌無法逃竄，而德國靜電療法，對於淋菌的巢穴，有徹底完全扑滅之偉效。而更佐以內服淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，則四難并而二美具，因為「克淋儂」能在吾人血液游弋，往來捕獲淋菌，一方使全身血液與細胞，因受「克淋儂」之刺激而發出一種抗淋噬菌作用。故頑固而纏編的淋病，亦能迅獲根治。</p>
<p>診時：上午十時至下午六時。自卽日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並贈價值一元之「性病　　　　　。</p>
<h3>過去一週</h3>
<p>投機家的地位愈糟。拿本週首尾兩天行市比較：買英匯的每鎊至少虧一元七角半買美金的每元至少虧六角。如果買的不是滙票而是外幣，每個單位便至少虧一元至三元以上。此外如買現金的每條至少虧六十元左右；囤　紗的，每包二十支雙馬至少虧五十二元；每擔通州花至少虧四五元。多頭陣容，已一敗塗地。可是買公債的，却都賺錢。像戊便漲起七角，在高低峯間且有一元以上的差利可得。旣得愛國的美名，還有錢賺！再好沒有！回顧戰事發生以來，在投機界，惟有債市比較最平穩。理由多到不可勝數，而多頭非做到底不可，也是其中主要理由之一。唯其如此，內債市塲便成爲最妥當最可靠的投資之所！</p>
<p>英法土簽定「互助恊定」之後，蘇土間互電聯歡。這或許又是蘇聯得擺脫歐局糾紛的另一個新因素吧？荷京曾傳蒙「滿」間日蘇又起衝突，雖未證實，但至少可以配合上述的猜測。而駐日美使格魯的演詞，美國務卿赫爾對上海租界的仗義執言與提供實力援助的諾言，更使遠東局面明朗。同時華軍在各綫上的英勇挺進，捷報頻傳，以及日方濫放和平　言，想作金蟬脫壳之計。諸如此類，無一不使市塲人心興奮而且堅定！所以懸測今週的市氣將更人佳境！（須予）</p>
<p>上海自二十七年上半期以後，物價逐漸增貴，最近物價增貴則更甚，人民生活感到萬分困難。近幾天來，物價有回跌勢。這是因爲今次歐戰與上次大戰，無論在時間空間方面，都不相同。洋貨的來源並沒有斷絕，就是自佔據區運來的物品，也並不如意想的那樣困難，所以理論上物價只有一天天的下落；可是一般投機者對囤貨尙不肯脫售，想等待好機會。但，稍爲一想，上漲的時期已成過去，再也不能實現投機的黃金夢。更要知道，物價超過人民購買力多多，一輩子不會有銷路的！（一粟）</p>
<p>歐戰啟幕後，交戰國對華貿易，大受打擊，輸入銳减，九月份滬海關進口額四八·八一六·九一六元，出口額六六·七一一·〇八〇元，由入超而變爲出超，是整個國家貿易好轉的現象，是復興國族莫大的助力，今後將消耗性的舶來品，儘量摒絕不用，同時努力生產以增進出口，前途必更樂觀！（王逹斐）</p>

<h3>曹家渡形勢緊張　暴徒又襲擊巡捕　偽自衛團負嵎開槍頑抗　雙方激戰甚久彈如雨下　暴徒兩死兩傷·華捕與一路人亦殞命</h3>
<p>二十日晚、租界巡捕、在越界築路區域被襲擊後、租界警務當局、在該處正加緊布防之際、詎昨日（廿二日）淸晨、該區曹家渡方面、突又發生同樣事件、所謂「自衛團」者將租界巡捕槍殺一人、擊傷一人、警務當局據報、即派大批探捕及紅色鐵甲車、馳赴該「自衛團」巢穴所在地極司非而路一〇八一號曹義小學兜剿、詎該團暴徒、竟膽敢首先向巡捕攻擊、並拋擲手溜彈、巡捕方面、迨不獲已、當以機槍還擊、相持兩小時、擊斃暴徒二名、傷數人、其兇燄始戢、旋由日憲兵聞訊趕到、將「自衛團」調離該處、改由日意兵駐守、迄至昨晨八時、情勢始轉和緩、惟租界當局、認為滬西情勢、業已更趨惡化、除一面繼續加强越界築路警力外、並續將昨晨所發生事件、向領事團提出報吿、茲將詳情分誌於後、</p>
<h3>偽自衛團終宵活動</h3>
<p>極司非而路一〇八一號曹義小學、於八月間被武裝暴徒佔據、即設「自衛團」在內、曾被意軍一度繳械、旋獲釋放後、雖仍伏處該屋、但常將大門緊閉、由後門出入、久無聲息、近來以滬西形勢轉變、該項暴徒、復漸形活躍、該團備有機器脚踏車一輛、專供黨徒駕駛、每於夜闌人靜之際、即駕車在越界築路上橫撞直衝、此種情形、被租界警務人員偵知、以該輩武裝份子、於深夜在工部局馬路上活動、實有違宵禁、即加勸吿、彼等初聞誥誡、尚能遵守、惟近日以來、又故態復萌、每逢深夜、輒駕車在極司非而路曹家渡一帶活動、昨晨事件、即當「自衛團」員駕車在極司非而路活動時發生、</p>
<h3>先行開槍擊倒華捕</h3>
<p>租界捕房、自偽警迭次肇事後、為維護該區警權、及嚴防暴徒擾亂治安計、特加派警探、在該區日夜巡邏、昨日淸晨、靜安寺捕房調戈登路捕房預備隊英籍第九十二號探長、偕同二五九四號華捕、乘坐機器脚踏車出差巡邏、當行經曹家渡時、適見自衛團武裝份子三人、正駕車馳騁、以其有違宵禁、當下車上前勸吿、詎該武裝份子非特不理、且有一人乘兩捕不備、出槍轟擊、當時兩捕猝不及防、華捕一人、彈由背部射人、經腹部穿出、即倒地不省人事、暴徒見已肇禍、即急驅車向巢穴逃去、</p>
<p>大隊巡捕聞警馳往</p>
<p>英探見華捕受害、亦急駕車返至附近崗亭中、用電話報吿靜安寺捕房、移時、救護車駛至、將受創華捕送山海關路巡捕醫院求治、同時、靜安寺捕房中西巡捕四十餘名、分乘五號暨六號鐵甲車、偕同戈登路捕房中西巡捕七十餘人、分乘一六二七　號及一六二七四號紅色警備汽車、趕至出事地點查勘、詎「自衛團」暴徙、愍不畏死、竟在巢穴附近、托槍以待、若干武裝份子、更攀登曹義小學四樓屋頂上埋伏、斯時、大批巡捕、即將「自衛團」所在地包圍、</p>
<p>暴徒抗拒發生激戰</p>
<p>「自衛團一見探捕合圍、非特不示屆伏、竟先發制人、開槍射擊、惟均未命中、而匍匐屋頂上之「自衛團」暴徒兩名、且膽敢向探捕拋擲手溜彈、計拋五枚、但爆發者祇有兩枚、亦未傷及探捕、探捕見暴徒槍彈齊施、即發槍還擊、警備車上之輕機關槍、亦即連珠而發、向屋面暴徒施行密集射擊、一時槍聲大作、彈如雨下、儼如一幕壯烈之爭奪戰、旋該兩名在屋頂上擲彈之暴徒、被探捕以機槍迎擊射死、樓下暴徒、亦勢呈不支、一塲惡鬥、乃漸形寂止、計自上午四時四十五分暴徒發第一槍起、激戰達十五分鐘之久、</p>
<p>在鏖戰中暴徒死傷</p>
<p>暴徒除兩名被擊死外、另有兩名受傷、經其夥伴送往梵皇渡履仁醫院施救、租界探捕在鏖戰之中、並未死傷、惟先時被暴徒所害之二五九四號華捕送巡捕醫院救治、但終因傷及要害、且流血過多、無法救治、延至上午八時二十分殞命、至鏖戰時、並有曹義小學對過荳腐店內之老司務一名、中流彈擊死、</p>
<p>日兵入駐暴徒撤退</p>
<p>當雙方激戰時、極司非而路開納路口滬西日憲兵司令部聞訊、即出動大隊憲兵的三四十人、督同大隊偽警、携帶全副武裝、乘坐軍用卡車、趕往曹義小學、其時暴徒以不支敗退、惡戰已歸沉寂、日憲兵趕到後、因租界警務人員、仍在曹義小學門首、嚴陣以待、乃命偽警先行下車、迅速佈成與租界警探對峙之勢、然後日憲兵下車、逕至曹義小學內、將「自衛團」武裝暴徒十一名、押解出門、帶入卡車、馳往日憲兵司令部、曹義小畢則改由日憲兵及偽警的共七八十名在內駐守、</p>
<p>秩序恢復戒備更嚴</p>
<p>租界警探、見武裝警探被日憲兵押走後、認為此事已可吿一段落、故亦繼之撤退、時已上午八時、曹家渡一帶、始得恢復秩序、惟租界方面、為在該區警備起見、於上午九時許、派出二號。四號。九號鐵甲車三輛、在曹家渡五角塲口戒備情勢甚為森嚴、日偽方面、則將曹義小學之大門緊閉、由日憲兵兩名、在外守衛、至該地帶原為意兵防區、故膠州路意兵營、於事出後亦派兵卅餘名、分乘卡車二輛、開至五角塲口協同戒備、</p>
<p>意兵二隊担任巡邏</p>
<p>大中社記者、於昨日下午、赴曹家渡視察、見曹義小學門首、有日憲兵三名、偽警二名駐守、五角塲停有裝甲車三輛、成一三角形、一在龍泰酒行前、一在鼎和祥烟行前、另一在萬順昌南貨號前、每輛有中西探捕六名防守、意軍二隊、每隊十五名、則在五角塲一帶、往來巡遜曹家渡方面、上午偽警踪跡甚少、直至下午二時許、偽警始大隊出現、在五角塲附近佈崗、共有二十餘人、餘則列隊往來巡行、</p>
<p>當出事時、以時在拂曉、居民多在睡夢中驚醒、極為恐懼、故遲至八時許、該處店舖、始行啟鬥、至被擊斃之荳腐店老司務、則係因好奇出看、不幸被擊身死、</p>
<p>當局決定呈報領團</p>
<p>又據可靠方面　息、此次「自衛團」兩度襲擊租界探捕、擲手溜彈至五枚之多、華捕一名、則被狙擊身死、上海各國當道、均大為剌激衝動、聞公共租界警務處、已繕具詳細報吿、即將呈請工部局、以便局方向領事團提出報吿、又據英文大美晚報消息、當雙方在曹義小學激戰時、駐防該處之意兵、曾加人警探方面、向暴徒發槍甚多、</p>

<h3>英武官史比亞　暢述被捕經過　自渝經延安北行備嘗苦楚　遭日軍逮捕覊禁十五星期　史氏下週赴美返英</h3>

<p>旅程槪述</p>
<p>史中校先目重慶首途、乘飛機至西安、抵西安後、勾留數日、搭汽車赴延安、盤桓的兩週、繼續其旅程、自延安乘汽車至米脂、既抵米脂、其行程之困難乃開始、藍此後數千哩、乃經崎嶇多山之鄉野而行也、史中校遂在米脂集騾馬成列、除其衛護者外、隻身啟程、經荒野前往北平、在此數千哩中、渠步行的七百哩、因該道路大部份不能策騎而行也、然渠經此崎嶇之地、毫無困難、僅認為類若週杪之遠足而已、</p>
<p>被禁生活</p>
<p>旅行七週後、始在張家口郊外宣樹子（譯音）小敎堂、遭日軍逮捕、史中校被日軍覊禁凡十五星期、其中十三星期、在密室監禁之沉寂中消度之、日軍許史中校有運動之權、惟須由武裝日兵衛隊護送、此項手續、既與英國管地英軍軍官行動之規例、截然相反、史中校乃拒絕出室運動、史中校被禁於張家口時、曾三度染恙、由日陛軍軍醫為之治療、</p>
<p>日方盤問</p>

<p>晤毛澤東</p>
<p>又大陸報云、史中校吿新聞記者稱、渠被禁於張家口將近四閱月、雖體重减少四十磅、但身體上未受影響渠被覊時、日方待遇平常、日軍醫之治療能力、在標準以下、渠於三月間自重慶出發、此行毫無秘密、因請教堂中人傳發渠已到達之消息、致日軍終乃決定加以逮捕、渠曾在晋冀兩省諒係日軍所侵佔之區內旅行兩閱月、但絕未見日兵或日旗、史中校又稱、渠至延安時、會遇共黨領袖毛澤東、毛氏係「心地正直之人」、世界該部份之共產民衆乃極健全、最有希望之人民、渠至張家口郊外、遭日軍逮捕、則按照國際公法、日軍應將渠移交英當局辦理、</p>

<p>屍體橫陳慘不忍覩</p>
<p>斯時禮堂上正舉行婚禮、證婚人朱鶴皋、致訓辭時、各賀客引頸翹足、興高彩烈之際、驟聞槍聲劈拍中槍應聲倒地者、屍體橫陳、頓時禮塲秩序大亂、呼救之聲、令人酸鼻、血濺地板、宛如泉湧、諸暴徒乘紛亂時、挾槍從容逸去、一般男女來賓、因亟圖逃命、而由扶梯踣下者、亦有數人、</p>

<h3>世界經濟學專家　歐本海美訪問記</h3>
<p>歐本海美教授，以一著名的經濟學者兼社會學者，既不容於納粹德國，又被遂於日本，孤零零地帶着唯一的一個親人—他的女兒，忽忽逃難來滬，這是一幅如何使人憤憤不平，如何使人深切同情的圖畫啊！允其是對於一個曾經聽過他的課的學生。記者就在這樣的一種情緒之下，急促地去拜會了教授一趟。</p>
<p>在電話裏聽取了我的身分和來意之後，歐本海美教授很歡喜地延見了。</p>
<p>「教授先生，多年不見了。」</p>
<p>「不，我在八年前，就給人扔出大學來了。」歐教授糾正着我的話，對於他的被趕出大學，表示着滿不在乎的樣子。我們屈指算了一下，略叙了當年的情形，歐教授很爽氣地提出他的衷心問題！</p>
<p>「我年紀大了，這裏的氣候，我不能受。美國加里福尼大學的事件，當然不成問題，但是我的女兒要去又麻煩得很，因為沒有猶太護照，我想到馬尼刺去講書，你有認識人麼？」</p>
<p>話剛說完，歐本海美小姐進來了，歐教授略加介紹，並重覆他剛講的話，歐小姐很天眞地說：</p>
<p>「是的，我的父親不能離開我，而我又祇有德國護照，到甚麼地方去，人家會多方詢問，調查，考慮，懷疑我是間諜。」</p>
<p>我答應我去打聽，看看有甚麼人同馬尼刺有關係，我們便談到一些別的問題上來了。歐教授把他所著的「資本論」攤在我的面前，指出所引中山先生的一段話給我看，並且說：</p>
<p>「孫中山平均地權的學說，是和我的學說差不多的。」</p>
<p>他說這句話的時候，頗表示得意，他問我是不是中山先生的信徒，他的女兒搶着說：</p>
<p>「中國人沒有不相信孫中山博士和蔣介石將軍的，除非是相信日本。」</p>
<p>問起中日戰爭的觀感，歐教授說：「我不是戰略家，不懂得軍事，但從經濟的觀點看來，日本支出成百萬萬日元的戰費，派出成百萬的軍隊到中國，整個國民經濟都受莫大打擊，現在原料缺乏，物價高漲，以這樣的小而疲敝的日本，要想吞下碩大無朋的中國，那是不可能的。」</p>
<p>「那麼，若從經濟觀念，來解釋目前戰爭原因，又將怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「哪，你讀過了我的「理論經濟學」的，在那書的最末二章說到資本主義須依賴外國市塲，但資本主義愈發展，則外國市塲愈縮小，醫如最初祇有英國資本主義，後來各國資本主義，如德國，比利時，荷蘭，美國……的資本主義也發展了，中國也開始資本主義化了，空的地方就愈來愈小了。國家本來就是維持國民經濟的機關，為爭　市場，就這　發生了戰爭。」</p>
<p>歐教授為避免他的逃難生活的困難，許多話郝不肯多談，大部份時問都在默小姐的參加之下，談一些生活上的問題。歐小姐很聰明，除諧日文日語外，並且認　了三千多個中國方塊字，祗是不會發音，現在正請人教普通話和上海方言。歐教搜自己，現在則在整理他的巨著「社會學」，準備將來新版增訂。他在經濟學上很不贊成英國古典派，當他很有勁地批評亞丹斯密，里加圖的時候，歐小姐打趣說：「我的父親不喜歡大學教授」。</p>
<p>當握手言別的時候，歐教授仍諄諄於馬尼刺的事，他說：「養老金給人取消了，自去年十二月離開德國，在外國逗留了九個月，雖有一點積蓄，究難持久，得在適宜的地方教點課」。</p>
<p>「先生，祝福你，全世界人民，允其是中國人民，都在為世界文化而奮鬥，全世界都歡迎眞正有學問的學者，先生的志願總會達到目的的」。</p>

<h3>共同生活的報吿　讀「一個小建議」後</h3>
<p>不知君的「一個小建議」，正合了筆者的心意，並且筆者在「八一三」的前一天就過着類似不知君所說的那種生活了，雖然和不知君說的有點出入，然而節省總是一樣，現在不妨也借春秋一角之地，把筆者的共同生活報吿一下：</p>
<p>在戰前半個月裹，每個人都在忙着找避難的房子，當然我也是免不了的，可是我借房子的之前是有組織的，預先聯合了三家住戶，言定除吃，自用品外，其餘都是公攤，就是像不知君說的「不分二房東和三房客」，大家都是一樣，於是在法租界租定了一幢街堂石庫門，就在「八一三」的前一天，開始過那所謂「共同生活」了。共同生活的規定如下：</p>
<p>租金</p>
<p>本來每月的租金三十六元，按三股分派，每家每月祇出十二元，不過像我們三家人口少，住不了這許多，於是把前樓又租出，每月租金九元，這樣每家每月租金又省了三元，祗須出九元即可，試問在這孤島上出這樣低的租金，而住着適意的房子，是難得的吧？這是共同益之一</p>
<p>燃料</p>
<p>一起首，三家合用一只大煤球爐，一噸煤球可燒四個多月，每月每家祇派着一元二角又强，後來因為煤球爐太慢，就改用拉風箱的煤爐，燒紅基煤，每噸需國幣五十元之譜（斯時煤價漸昂），自早晨五時生起（因為我們三家都有早起的習慣）至晚間九時止，三家的晨。午·晚三餐，以及茶水一切等，皆賴這只煤爐，允其是夏天裏的洗澡水更利害，可是每噸煤平均也要燒七個月，每家每月也不過化二元四角，就是現在煤價貴到每噸八十多元，我們每月也祗出了四元多點，這是共同利益之二。</p>
<p>即舉上列兩項利益，每月已節省不少靡費，其他像房捐，電費，甚至掃帚，鷄毛帚，電燈泡，燒水的銅壼以及一切公衆用物，都是公攤分派，這比較各自為政又節省了。按照最近三個月（七八九三月）結算，每家每月（除衣，食兩項外）祗出十六元强。眞可算得便宜極了，這都歸功於共同生活，一方面也要靠大家的誠意合作，如果有一個存着自私自利的覜念的話，那也早就沒有這利益可享了。</p>
<p>筆者所說的共同生活，雖然和不知君有點不合（不僱傭婦，各餐自製），因為各家的主婦都沒有孩子，而且都是沒有職業的，所以也用不到僱傭婦，這樣非但可以乘機練習勤勞，且於國難期內的支出，也可少費一點。</p>
<p>末了，我希望孤島上各個主婦們，如果是合住在一起的，照着我所說的，共同組織起來，看結果「是不是比各自為政來得吃虧？」（晋毅）</p>
<p>編者按：同時接到一位讀者的來信，他對「共同生活」歷舉若干困難，醫如飯食，就你要吃魚，我要吃肉；僱用一個僕人則東家差遺了，西家依然要自己動手，諸如此類，確是困難叢生，但是讀了晋毅君的報吿，在大家誠意合作之下，這辦法似乎還行得通，不過這是艱苦的生活，而不是吃魚吃肉的生活</p>
<h3>「應試報務員經過」的內幕　滬達無綫電學校來函</h3>
<p>記者足下：</p>
<p>敬啟者，閱　報十月六日所載「應試報務員經過」一文，未列校名，而此次大美晚報所載，涉及敝校，其中文字有相同處，惟與事實經過，顯有不符，敝校已致函該報更正，爰將考試經過情形為貴報告。查敝校對於各方需要人材，素在本校優良畢業生中推任，並不公開招考，此次由常得輪船報務員龔季誠假敝校考試報務員，蓋由於上屆畢菜生某君之介紹，要求假敝校地址，代內地某機關招考技術員，並聲言將商取其他無錢電校繼續舉行，敝校當時會詢以何方需要人材，則龔某曾歷舉各地聯絡人物‘相吿，惟因目下環境特殊，未便詳吿為詞，同時龔某在滬上為一有職業者，且既有人介紹，爰乃通吿本校學生不妨一試，然既不用聳動方法登報，代為招生，則何來招搖之事？惟具函貴報之五位學生，所以亦在做校共考者，實由於龔某亦向中華第一職業補校與該校無綫電系主任張君接洽考期，該校張君以龔某擬在該校晚間考試，並無多餘課室應用，乃具函將該校學生十二人（此五位亦在其內）連同照片報名費致函敝校，耍求於敝校在龔某假地考試時列席同考，並囑將報名費等轉交龍某，有張君函件可以證明，當時敝校對於收取報名費，會加反對，而龔某則以因此可加甄拔為詞，然則此中華第一職校之五位學生乃向中華第一職校報名而非向敝校報名，彰彰明甚，蓋敝校始終未曾登報代招也。厥後常得輪因颶風，數次愆期進口，龔某未能到校主持，迨至最後日期，由壟某來校考試，敝校會派人協助，蓋示鄭重之意，事後龔某曾謂錄取人員，須與另一無綫電校考試完畢後同時發表，此後另一無綫電校且會公開招考報務員，此事當為此具函貴報之五位學生所深悉，迨錄取名單發表後，龔某來校欲收取報名費，敝校吿以當暫時代為保存，迨至錄取人員出發前交付，藉昭鄭重，乃龔某遲不辦理，且來函要求將錄取各員另收保證金五元，（有函件可資證明）敝校以為如此行為，跡近虛偽，乃派人至常得輪龔某處質問確實消息，彼時會以掛號信寄與致函貴報之五位學生囑其同往質問，當時未見到來，敝校以龔某態度可疑，乃毅然將代收之報名費概行發還，（此五位學生在致貴報文中已證明敝校將報名費發還）此過去之經過情形也。龔某之假名招考，實屬可恨，然敝校當時以為此種考試不妨稍盡義務，不疑有他，而敝校既不借名公開招考，更無籍端謀利之處，有何不坦白之行為乎？而致函貴報之五位學生，乃向彼等所畢業之中華第一職校張君處報名，則報名手續是否應由該校負責，抑由敝校負責？現敝校以此五位學生不究來源，含血噴人，枉加誣衊，或當別有其他用意，爰乃馳函此五位學生，請其明白答復彼等之報名地點，究在中華第一職校，抑在敝校？而此五人之投考，是吾出該校轉來，抑或由敝校招來，以辨黑白。（此函未見覆來）爰將經過情形奉告，請假貴報一席地惠登，以正視聽，而重名譽為禱。</p>
<p>滬達無綫電學樣謹啟</p>
<h3>覆某公司同人</h3>
<p>某公司同人鑒：</p>
<p>為前方將士微慕寒衣捐自然是每個國民的天職，貴公司人事部主任的出而干涉，實在是令人費解的，不過來信並不詳盡，其間或許有什麼誤會，請你們將經過情形吿訴你們的主任先生，他決沒有理由干涉你們的愛國行動的。編輯窒</p>
<h3>送兒子上學</h3>
<p>— 潔</p>
<p>『天子重英豪，文章教爾曹，萬般皆下品，唯有讀齊高。』因為讀書可望高，所以我將四歲七個月的兒子在半勸半威嚇之下，送進一所模範小學。當第一天經過校長單簡的口試後，認為有二個條件是足够進一年級的：第一是以前讀過幼稚園；第二是自已會寫名字和識得阿拉伯字母由一到十。那末，這入學的問題可算是吿一段落了。可是，一個禮拜之後，校長先生根據該級主任的報吿，証明吾的兒子不够讀一年級；並且提出充分的証據來。這証據是：他不會做日記，祗好降入幼稚園，而且附帶的補充一句，敝校的程度確乎是深一些，繼着莞爾地一笑。在我，基於癩痢頭兒子自已好的通常理論下，頗為不服氣，首先辯明，教育部明令幼稚園是培植合羣力的度初步團體生活，小學一年級才開始一切智力的授與。現在，一年級便要做日記，這表明一年級的小朋友需要有獲得文字的工具之後，已經能够利用這工具而做日記，我認為這是苛求。可是校長先生似乎不吾認我這論據，却以全班都能做日記，惟有我的兒子是例外，所得的結論，還是維持他的成命。我在無可反抗的顏顏下，隨手翻一本這些起乎敎育部令程度的小朋友的日記本，原來，一頁追溯到半年之前的大雪，紛飛在庭園中作為材料的日記，在這暑假開始的目前記着，於是我才悟得這位級任先生的觀點，我不怨別的，只要我兒子早回來和我商量，我保証做一大段德國西綫戰事的目擊記好了，既緊張又新鮮，我抱怨兒子的不够取巧的智力平白地使我增加憤懣</p>
<p>校長先生因之用另一事實証明他的貴校稈度是確乎深一些，他說，因為鑒於畢業生投考學校是最能反映校譽的，所以本年度特別指令小學五六年級一律要讀古文，這是他本年度最高的德政之一。可是我，決不願和這樣見解的校長先生再我麻煩，去找尋教部頒佈的小學課程標準等一類出版物，而唯有為這批小朋友們悲，因為，一切的無謂的心血，經常地為一己私見的這種校長先生所白流，我嘆息，而且嘆息得沒半名話可說。</p>

<h3>被褥的淸潔與衛生</h3>
<p>— 沁田</p>
<p>我毋知道衣服要常洗常換，可是被褥不常洗不常換，是不是合理呢？不用我說，當然是不好的，須知被褥什麼地方最容易髒呢？當然是在頭的部分，承受口涎，涕與頭髪面部的油垢，數日即污，似非一禮拜洗一次不可，而一週洗一次被，未免太費事，所以應該謀補救的辦法。即以一塊白布，釘在被頭的一端，這樣四五天後將白布洗一次，兩個禮拜洗一次被，就可以了。</p>
<p>同時被更應該晒，因為被中蘊蓄周身呼出來的炭氣汗味，並易便棉花乾鬆，炭氣一蒸發，被中的一切細菌類皆可殺死，所以遇晴明的天氣，應該把所有的被褥全搬出來晒。</p>
<p>疊被也很有道理，中國舊式疊被，是將被筒打開，對折再三折，這樣被中含蓄之氣可以散出去一點，但是仿洋式疊被，將被筒整理一下，疊成一個正方形，這樣，一切濁穢之氣，全都藏在被中，或是將被平舖在牀上，上面多蒙一塊被單，他目己以為美觀，殊不知藏垢納污，莫此為甚，遠不及中國式的疊被法來得好。</p>
<h3>湖南女學生的鞋襪</h3>
<p>— 明智</p>
<p>上期本刋上談到湖南學生的土布制服，大家都知道了湖南學生的衣着，現在我來談一談，關於湖南女學生的鞋襪，筆者會在湖南求學多年，願將他們的鞋襪，也向大家介紹一下：</p>
<p>伊們常年的衣服，都是一件元色土布褂子和一條短的土布元色裙子外，鞋，從春到冬，都是一雙元色土布鞋子而已，從不穿皮鞋，也不穿毛綫呢的鞋，一身都是土布，絕沒有一絲毫的洋貨。三湘人民，愛國心是任何省所不及的，而且他們同學中，又互相監視，所以終年是一雙元色土布鞋子。</p>
<p>至於襪子，除了黑白兩色外其他顏色的，都不能穿，穿絲襪更談不到了。</p>
<p>如果把他們與上海的女學生相比一下，諸位可有什麼感想？</p>
<h3>减少汽車闖禍的妙法</h3>
<p>— 陸德綱</p>
<p>近年來汽車的數量天天在增加，因此汽車闖禍的事件，也一天多似一天，這對於行的安全當然是一種很嚴重的威脅。</p>
<p>汽車闖禍的原因，多半是因為駕車速率太快，所以現在美國製造汽車的廠家，都特地在新製車上，附設一架靈巧的留聲機。若逢駕車的人將汽車速率超過每小時一百公里時，這留聲機便自動會發出莊嚴的聲調，連續不停的警吿駕駛人道：「當心！你將闖禍了！」若速度超過每小時一百三十公里時，留聲機便發出憤怒的語氣道：「不是你自己撞死，便是路人被你碾死！」若速度達每小時一百五十公里時，留聲機中便奏一隻凄凉的喪禮進行曲，使駕駛人聽了驚心動魄，不得不將速率减低。</p>
<p>還有誰都知道汽車闖禍與吾，和駕駛人的謹慎技術等也很有關係，所以在美國若干路政完美的城市中，時常有穿了便服的巡捕，隨時隨地留意路上司機人的技術和謹慎的程度，若發現有駕駛成績優良的司機人，便贈送他若干張星期日的電影院戲票，以示獎勵。反之若見有駕駛不謹慎或技術不良的司機，雖未闖禍，也必與以相當的警吿，使防患於未然。</p>
<p>自上列兩法實施後，美國汽車闖禍的案件確已减少許多，使行的安全問題多得一層有力的保障！</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>薺菜早又上巿了；這東西雖是菜蔬的一種，却與黃豆芽一樣，天然的含有鮮味，倒像是天生帶着「味精」一類的調味粉一般。薺茶本是野生的，鄉下的小兒女，往往在田野間隨時發掘，呌做「挑薺茶」，因為不化甚麼本錢，所以價格較為便宜，可是一到上海茶市中，當然也便宜不到那裏去了。薺茶淸炒也好，加些豆腐或豆腐乾絲就行。要講究一些，便來一個薺菜炒冬笋，那是有資格加入上品筵席中的。你要做輩的家常菜，那麼薺茶炒肉絲，或炒肉片，薺茶肉丁豆腐羹，薺茶肉末嵌麵筋或油豆腐。你要講究一些，那麼薺茶炒山雞片，薺菜炒蝦仕炒腰花等，無往而不宜，不在我這經濟菜單中，沒有它毋的位置了。</p>

<h3>薛岳將軍的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 張鎮山</p>
<p>薛岳將軍的個性是剛毅而謙厚的；態度是嚴峻而正直的；決斷機課，是智勇兼具。他所有的時間，精力，都全部的用在工作上，而同時，又因為體格强健，所以他的私生活就很簡單儉樸，猶如一個普通人。他不常穿便衣，不常戴使帽，綾羅綢緞之類，與他根本無緣。自晨至晚，自春至冬，週而復始，他都是穿着軍服，所更換的，不過是質的不同而已，灰布的，嗶嘰的，厚呢的，隨着氣候的轉移而更換着。他的體格對於寒暑有一種强度的抵禦力，例如：因戎馬倥惚，一套衣服可連穿若干時，夏天穿春天的，秋天又穿夏天的，都不覺苦。</p>
<p>人的體質本有寒熱性的，腸胃消化力也有强弱的不同，可是他却不然，從無所謂不服的食品，也不需要選擇適合口味的餚饌。每天飯食由伙夫製就，由勤務兵送上來，因為處在前錢，總是鹹貨多於新鮮蔬茶，允以鹹魚鹹蝦等，幾乎成了每日的唯一佐餐品。他本不喜吃辣，可是湘省是產辣椒之區，在夏秋兩季裏，遍地都是辣椒，因而飯食也每餐必有辣椒，使他也不能不習慣了。</p>
<p>他的住，若以搏鬥的時間和地點來說，實在無從說起。他雖然是第×戰區司令長官兼湘主席，而晚上睡覺的享受，有時還不如我們舒適，兩塊門板，一襲棉毯，是平常的事，而且還睡得很酣樂。假如開拔途中，那末，山地，破廟，陋巷，也和士兵同樣的投宿；石坡間，泥地上，辦公休息，是隨處都安。在這樣沒有一定駐紮處的時期，家屬就不在一處，所以暫無私邸的事受。</p>
<p>行，本來是陸軍的特長，連續走幾百里不算一會事；爬山越嶺，允如都市中人登『屋頂花園」，言之今人咋舌　內地各處公路雖然暢通，但某些地帶尚須利用兩隻脚，所以他能走能奔。不過現在為了節省時間，大多是乘汽車，或騎馬，馳騁於湘鄂邊區地帶，發揮其所長，以爭取整個民族的永遠自山生存。</p>
<p>我們在這裏謹以至誠向民族戰士敬禮，並熱切地期望着捷昔的續報。</p>
<h3>閒話痰盂</h3>
<p>— 四五六</p>
<p>既　痰孟，當然用以承痰，但事質上並不一定如此，小孩子無處大小便，就把痰孟當作馬桶，這已成了司空見慣的事情了，這種現象，在醫生診所裏最多，輪船裏除非沒有痰盂，吾則一定撒滿了尿　完結。</p>
<p>旅館裏的痰盂，並不是預備吐痰的，除了接受茶脚之外，內容極多，有香烟屁股，橘子皮香蕉等等還有藥水棉花呢，這是誰都想小到的，早晨旅館裏的僕役出來倒痰盂，便有許多小畢一舉候着，你爭我奪的尋覓值錢的東西，他們最歡喜的是橘子皮，洗干凈之後，便可以賣給糖食店裏去做九製陳皮，我們出了很大的價格，買了九製陳皮，覺得味道的確不錯，倘若知道是用痰盂裏的橘子皮做的，那是連隔夜飯都要吐出來的。</p>
<p>從前火車站裏，放着幾只大痰盂，大得像小七石缸差不多，可以說是全中國最大痰盂了。這種痰盂，我國常用他做花盆，日本人買去了做火缽，一年的銷路倒不少呢。</p>

<h3>Continued Advances by Chinese Forces in Northern Hunan, Recovering Important Outposts in Yuezhou Suburbs, Attacking Troops Along the Railway Line Reach Vicinity of Matang, Part of the Force Captures Dubotan and Advances Towards Bailuoji, Key Points Including Shangxialongwan Bridge and Changshan Also Retaken</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, despite the torrential rain in the past two days in northern Hunan, the Chinese forces continued their advance towards Yuezhou. Important Japanese outposts in the suburbs of Yuezhou have been successively recaptured by the Chinese forces, intensifying the encirclement. The Japanese troops in Yuezhou are now firing indiscriminately at the Chinese positions. On the northern Jiangxi front, the Chinese forces are still gradually advancing towards Wu Ning. (Reuter dispatch, 22nd) The three key points of Shangxialongwan Bridge and Changshan, located more than ten li northeast of Miluo Xinqiangzhen, were completely recovered by the Chinese forces last night. Starting on the night of the 20th, the Chinese forces on the north bank of the Xinqiang River launched an attack on the Japanese troops at Xialongwan Bridge. Due to the heavy rain, the Japanese sentries were negligent, and they were killed by the Chinese advance troops. The Chinese army then successfully captured Xialongwan Bridge in one fell swoop before dawn on the 21st, causing hundreds of Japanese casualties. From there, the Chinese forces split into two groups and continued their attacks on Shanglongwan Bridge and Changshan. Although the Japanese used artillery to bombard the Chinese forces several times, they were finally completely recovered by the brave Chinese soldiers on the night of the 21st. Starting today, the Chinese forces are dividing into two groups to continue their advance towards Xinkaitang and Qinggangyi. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

After midnight on the 19th, an order was given for a general attack from all directions, and fierce fighting broke out in the area east of Baishan Temple (east of Xiangning).

<h3>New Regulations Issued by the Ministry of Finance Prohibiting the Deposit or Pledge of Gold; Failure to Report Gold Results in Confiscation and a Penalty of 50 Times the Value</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Ministry of Finance issued new regulations today prohibiting banks and money shops from using gold as collateral for loans and prohibiting pawnshops from accepting gold as collateral. Any banks or money shops with gold collateral must report the details to the four banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, or their branches, within 30 days. When the loan period expires and the loan is not repaid, the gold should be exchanged for legal tender at the above four banks and must not be sold privately. The government will pay a handling fee and bonus. Pawnshops will also follow this procedure. However, gold weighing less than one tael is allowed to be redeemed by the original owner. Gold weighing more than one tael should be handed over to the above four banks by the pawnshop together with the original owner. If it is concealed and not reported, a penalty of 10 to 50 times the value of the gold will be imposed, and the gold will still be confiscated in full. The purpose of this measure is to increase the government's gold reserves. (Reuter dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Amendments to the Regulations on the Handover of Civil Servants</h3>
<p>Chongqing: On the 21st, the National Government issued an order promulgating the revised Articles 2, 4, and 11 of the Regulations on the Handover of Civil Servants.

<h3>Jiangxi Province Prepares to Establish National High School</h3>

<h3>The Economic Lifeline of Japan is Actually in the Hands of the United States; Remarks by Bishop Yu Bin in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Bishop Yu Bin of Nanjing, who spent eight months in the United States representing the Chinese Refugee Relief Committee to raise funds, told an AP reporter today that Japan's economic lifeline is actually in the hands of the United States. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, 50-60% of Japan's military imports came from the United States. At present, imports of military supplies from the United States have reached 80% of Japan's total military imports. As for Japan's exports, 80% were previously consumed by Europe and North and South America. However, since Britain and France became embroiled in the vortex of war with Germany, the United States has become the lifeline of Japan's trade. Bishop Yu also said that when he was in the United States, the American people felt most pleased about the announcement of the abrogation of the US-Japan trade treaty. It is expected that after the expiration of the US-Japan trade treaty, Japan will at most be able to establish a temporary trade arrangement with the United States. However, considering the horror of the American people towards the various crimes committed by the aggressors in China, it is doubtful whether Japan will be able to establish a temporary trade arrangement with the United States. (AP dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Well-informed sources here believe that the outcome of the dispute over the extraterritorial road construction area in Shanghai will largely depend on the attitude of the United States. Since the outbreak of the European War, only the United States is in a position to take active measures in the Far East to curb Japan's continued infringement of the interests of third countries. The Chinese newspapers here all said that if the remarks made by US Secretary of State Hull and the speech made by US Ambassador to Japan Grew are indeed the case, they are another indication that the United States is taking a firm stance on Far Eastern affairs. Although the attack on the Shanghai Municipal Council personnel is surprising, Japan's desire to change the status quo of the International Settlement has long been known to the general public. Well-informed sources here expect that Japan will now quietly observe the attitude of the United States before making further plans to seize the extraterritorial road construction area. (Reuter dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Untrue Demands on China; Soviet Union Denies Japanese Rumors</h3>
<p>Moscow: Regarding rumors that the Soviet Union has made various demands on the Chinese government, the Communist Party organ Pravda recently published an editorial on Sunday, solemnly denying it, saying it was the work of rumor-mongers. It said, "The radio station of that country (Japan) issued provocative news a few days ago, and then the rumor-mongers themselves denied it. What's the use of this? Unexpectedly, a certain Japanese news agency also broadcast a message a few days ago, saying that the Soviet Union demanded to station troops in the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang in China, and to redden the northwestern provinces under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. If China refuses this request, the Soviet Union will use force. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang, has entrusted Zhu De, the leader of the Communist Party of that country, to come to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet Union Standing Committee in order to reduce this request. All of this is pure nonsense. The Soviet Union has neither made such a request in the past nor will it make such a request in the future. It has never threatened China. Zhu De does not have the mission to conduct negotiations, and he is not even in Moscow." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>近衛之意念</h3>
<p>Reason and emotion are two aspects of human instinct. The two are intertwined like links in a chain, unable to be separated entirely, yet also unable to perfectly align. Each possesses its own space, and the waxing and waning of the space occupied varies depending on the person, the time, and the matter at hand. For instance, in discussing peace and war: peace is naturally the desire of civilized humans and the inevitable conclusion of all wars. This is ordinary reason, general common sense, and does not fall within the realms of profound thought, grand policies, or arcane techniques. War, by its nature, involves destruction and is therefore painful and cruel, making the aversion to war a common sentiment among civilized humans. However, when the nation faces a crisis of survival, the common response is to unite in anger and fight the enemy with fervor. The ability to fight is based on intelligence, but to be bellicose goes against common sense and normal feelings.</p>
<p>China is fighting to resist aggression and seek survival, and is forced to fight, not because it is fond of war. Now, after more than two years of resistance, discussions about seeking peace have become increasingly complex. The internal basis for this complexity lies in the intertwining of reason and emotion. However, not only do reason and emotion fail to perfectly align, but the space they occupy also varies significantly from person to person, leading to this complex discourse. We need not list all the past announcements to the nation and abroad by the Kuomintang, the National Government, and military leaders, as well as recent figures like Zhang Qun, Wang Chonghui, and Guo Taiqi, stating how China could consider peace. Comparing these statements with the recent arguments for peace reveals their discrepancies and complexities. Given that peace and war are major events affecting the nation for centuries, failing to simplify the complexities is not a blessing for the nation and will ultimately lead to failure, it is safe to say. To achieve simplification, each side must abandon extraneous thoughts, eliminate politeness, and restore their own clear sincerity. They must remove their "colored glasses" and recognize that patriotism and national salvation are the righteous spirit pervading everyone's heart. In short, apart from a high national spirit, they must restrain their emotions as much as possible, organize their reason, and then hope to return to simplicity. Otherwise, not only will simplicity be unattainable, but the mutual stimulation and collision will only lead to greater complexity. But how easy is it to organize reason? Some have lost their reason entirely due to emotion, some discard reason like worn-out shoes for the sake of emotion, some deliberately distort their reason, and some, lacking sufficient reason, do not realize they have fallen into distortion. Examining the arguments for peace and war often reveals much unease, leading to the understanding that organizing reason and establishing a unified public opinion is extremely difficult. Studying each point of unease is necessary for reason, but such study must be based on the premise that speakers and listeners are calm and collected. Otherwise, rational study will only fuel emotional agitation, heading in the opposite direction, and this should stop.</p>
<p>However, there is one aspect that can serve as the most fundamental and straightforward examination. Aside from its internal foundation, China's discourse on seeking peace has an external cause, namely the statement made by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe on December 22nd of last year, which elicited sharply contrasting responses in China. Those advocating for peace regard Konoe's statement as the standard for negotiating peace. Without questioning the merits or demerits, right or wrong, of the positive and negative responses to Konoe's statement; without questioning Konoe's statement's fundamental position in Japan's national policy, or how binding it is on Japanese military personnel and politicians; without questioning how dangerous it would be for China to suddenly abandon resistance based on Konoe's statement. In essence, those positively responding to Konoe's statement deeply believe that this statement takes "equality and mutual benefit between China and Japan as its basic principle" and deeply believe that Japan has "no territorial demands on China, no demands for military expenses reparations, no demands for economic monopoly, respects China's sovereignty, and respects China's independence and integrity." Without questioning whether Konoe's statement is truly so clear or whether everything it puts forth is reliable; without questioning how the so-called joint anti-communism and economic cooperation do not contradict sovereignty and independence. Is this so-called deep belief a judgment of reason? Or is it mixed with emotion? Or is it dominated by a large amount of emotion? If reason is esteemed, then it is not appropriate to have such deep belief without factual proof. Who would have known that the facts were so distant, and Konoe made supplementary statements after his initial statement? He did not fully discuss it, but it explained that the aggressor, Japan, "therefore sent a punitive expedition to the Chinese mainland." In the midst of "not demanding territory" and "respecting China's integrity," he stated "China, Japan, and Manchukuo...good neighborly friendship." In the midst of "respecting China's sovereignty," he stated "China has its own traditions and customs, allowing autonomy to be their strength, so the responsibility will generally be entrusted to the Chinese people: excessive interference will be strictly noted." All of this makes it easy to judge Konoe's intentions with reason, which are vastly different from the Chinese arguments for peace, which is obviously evident. Transitioning from war to peace is inevitable and natural. As for the path to peace, although opinions differ, and complete agreement cannot be reached, yet based on what Konoe wrote, under rational review, it should certainly be commonly regarded as inappropriate.</p>

<p>London: The British Admiralty recently announced that twelve German planes attacked ships escorted by the British in the North Sea this afternoon. British fighters and escort ships engaged them, and at least three German planes were shot down by British aircraft. A fourth was forced to land at sea after being hit by intense British fire. There were no British casualties, and none of the escorted ships were damaged. The Ministry of Aviation also reported that British escorted ships spotted German planes this afternoon and sent a signal, but the German planes had already escaped by the time British fighters arrived. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London: Observers here claim that Germany has recently attacked British ships and bases with aircraft because Berlin now knows that the submarine war has failed, so it is trying to use aircraft to thwart British naval superiority and break the British naval blockade that is cutting off German supplies. However, German aircraft cannot accurately hit targets under naval gunfire. Aware of this situation, Germany must be uneasy. The confession of a certain German aviator that he could not escape and that German aircraft were too slow is very meaningful. When German aircraft attacked the Firth of Forth, British aircraft shot down three German planes without any British losses. The pilots who shot down the three German planes were all members of the Auxiliary Air Force who, a few weeks ago, were still stockbrokers, lawyers, and sheep farmers. The loss rate of the attacking German aircraft is 30 percent, which, like the loss of one-third of German submarines, is a huge loss for Germany. Furthermore, the German air raids have not achieved significant results. As for British ships, the loss rate is only 5/1000, which has now been replenished by new ships. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to official announcements here, the 1,450-ton Swedish ship "Adolph," en route from Gothenburg to the United Kingdom, was sunk by a German submarine north of the Shetland Islands. The ship's nineteen sailors were rescued by the Norwegian ship "Beskaya." The reason for the sinking was that the ship was carrying contraband. (Haitong Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: A German ship struck a mine and sank at noon today between Falster, Sweden, and Møn, Denmark. Of the 69 crew members, 64 died, and the remaining five were rescued by Danish aircraft and immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. One of them has already died. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Air Raid Alert on Northeast Coast of England; Aircraft Nationality Unknown</h3>
<p>London: The Ministry of Aviation recently announced that two aircraft of unknown nationality flew near Hull on the northeast coast of England this afternoon. The coastal air defense team immediately issued an air raid alert, and the anti-aircraft guns opened fire. Fighter planes also took off to chase them away. (Havas Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>London: Residents of towns along the coast of Yorkshire heard an air raid alert yesterday afternoon. At the same time, towns in Lincolnshire heard gunfire from the North Sea and also issued air raid alerts. The enemy planes never came, and the alerts were soon lifted. Although the people heard the alerts, they remained calm. As soon as the alerts were lifted, they resumed work as if nothing had happened. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Troops on the Western Front Increased to 200,000; Continuous Heavy Rain Causes River Flooding; Only Local Artillery Battles on the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Paris: The second batch of 100,000 British troops has arrived in France and was quickly sent to the front yesterday, bringing the total to 200,000. Despite continuous heavy rain in the past 48 hours, reinforcements, materials, guns, food, and fuel continue to arrive at the front lines. On the roads, British transport vehicles, heavy artillery, trucks loaded with food and gasoline, light artillery vehicles, and cars of all sizes fill the roads. French Generalissimo Gamelin visited British General Gort at headquarters yesterday afternoon. Gamelin also expressed satisfaction with the British equipment and armaments. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters recently released War Bulletin No. 95, stating, "The enemy and our side engaged in artillery battles in certain areas of the front today. Other than that, all was quiet." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Paris: News from last night indicates that outpost battles and light artillery fire in the Moselle and Saar regions were the only activity along the entire line in the past 20 hours. Authoritative sources claim that the war on the entire line has entered a "state of uncertainty." Both sides are adopting defensive strategies. Heavy rain and severe cold weather are preventing large-scale battles. Neither side is immediately attacking the other. Military experts stated in "Le Petit Parisien" that the French army is making strategic withdrawals this week because it has determined that there can be no large-scale offensive this year. The French army is preparing a new intermediary line to consolidate its positions before making strategic withdrawals. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris: Semi-official sources here recently commented on the situation on the Western Front, stating that the withdrawal of our forward troops from the west bank of the Blies River in the German Saar region was appropriate. The rivers along the front lines have flooded, and the plains have become marshlands. Even if the enemy does not attack, it is actually impossible to hold the area. Therefore, our army withdrew to the high ground on the east bank of the Blies River to avoid enemy attacks, because enemy troops are blocked by the flooded area before they can reach our outposts. In addition, our army has adopted defensive tactics. The Warndt Forest is useless to defend and, on the contrary, can become a target for enemy outposts and ambushes. Therefore, it had to be abandoned. However, there are two hills that are of great strategic value. Not only were they not abandoned, but the number of troops defending them was greatly increased. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Luxembourg: This morning, French artillery fire was intense, bombarding the village of Besch and the road from Besch to Sehndorf. Witnesses believe that the German offensive has been repelled. Aircraft were very active afterward. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>British Secretary of State for War Broadcast Speech: States that Britain and France are in a Favorable Position for a Protracted War; The Goal is to Restore the Czech and Polish States; Ceasefire and Peace Must Be Guaranteed</h3>
<p>London: Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha delivered a broadcast speech this evening, stating, "Our Expeditionary Force has arrived in France. The process went smoothly and safely. Overall, our Expeditionary Force consists of one, the advanced troops that have already crossed the sea to France; two, the large army that is currently in training. In addition, there are militiamen and 250,000 young people who completed registration today, and volunteers with no age limit. All three of these are the reserve force of the large army, and the number of volunteers enlisting is increasing daily, so the strength of the military will continue to grow. Nationalist Socialist Germany, in view of the concentration of power in the British Empire, will certainly understand that, based on recent combat experience, no matter which country's troops attack pre-arranged positions, there will be no advantage. Poland has no Maginot Line. On the Western Front, strong fortifications have already been built and are becoming stronger daily. If the enemy launches a large-scale attack, they will certainly pay a heavy price. As for the second path, our commanders may not act rashly and make unnecessary sacrifices. Although the front-line situation is very quiet at this moment, it must be understood that the situation has already developed decisively. Nationalist Socialist Germany has always issued the slogan that 'all countries should allow Germany to act freely in Eastern Europe.' Poland is just one point in Germany's plan for eastward conquest. Germany also wants to control the Baltic countries and invade Romania via Poland. However, Germany's plan in the Baltic region has been thwarted by the Soviet Union, and in Southeastern Europe, our respected ally Turkey is bravely and decisively resolved to act as a barrier. In the Near East, Iraq is our loyal ally. Overall, how should Germany evaluate its assets and liabilities in the East after seven weeks of war? As for the Western Front, our merchant ship tonnage losses are less than one percent of the total. The current tonnage is still 21 million tons. On the naval side, two important warships have been lost, and many soldiers from the naval and air forces have died. We do not underestimate these sacrifices. As for those who fought German aircraft in the Firth of Forth, they were members of our Auxiliary Air Force. This was their first battle, and they achieved remarkable success. How extensive our final efforts will be depends on whether the military factories can fully supply military equipment and various equipment. Therefore, all factories must fulfill their responsibilities. In addition, the self-governing territories are now training troops to assist in the war and have sent representatives to London to work with the British government to discuss how to enrich the efforts of the British Empire. The army in India has also stationed troops in various strategic locations. As for the third path, the enemy, after causing a war with great audacity, now wants to find a way to evade it. This is what we must first guard against. It must be known that any peace proposal based on recognizing acts of betrayal is not something we can consider. If we want to abandon war and make peace, we must have guarantees that can establish a new order where all countries are no longer in danger of being oppressed by Nationalist Socialism. This war is not just a battle between our 'Spitfire' fighter planes and German Heinkel planes, or a battle between our destroyers and German submarines. In fact, the meaning is far greater and is a struggle between good and evil. We are fighting not only to rebuild the Czech and Polish states. Our goal is not limited to geographical boundaries but focuses on the spiritual realm of mankind. In essence, this war is not fought to revise the map but to restore an environment where all nations and individuals, including the German nation, can survive or be reborn. Our purpose is fixed and will not be shaken in the slightest. We have accepted the provocation of totalitarian politics and will certainly defeat it. There is a saying: Those who strike people with a sword will die by the sword. Here we must ask, what can the leaders of Nationalist Socialist Germany give to people? Austria is a Germanic nation. After being merged by Germany, what minimum amount of happiness have the leaders of Nationalist Socialist Germany given them? What have they done that is worthy of remembrance by future generations? Is it not torture, concentration camps, and secret police facilities? Is it not trapping Europe in base means such as ethnic hatred and religious persecution? At this moment, our cities, all of Europe, and the entire world are shrouded in black clouds. Only by defeating Nationalist Socialist Germany will there be light in the future." (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3>Lloyd George Statement of Attitude</h3>
<p>London: Former Prime Minister Lloyd George spoke to 5,000 voters in his constituency today, stating that my recent remarks in the House of Commons have been misunderstood as advocating surrender. It must be known that Britain has a just cause. If we surrender, we will bring shame to Britain and the Empire and invite the contempt of the world. We are not a defeated country. I will never act like a defeated country and hastily ask for peace regardless of the cost. We should aim to achieve lasting peace. None of the promises made by Hitler before and after the Munich Conference have been fulfilled. Since Hitler breaks his word so often, it is difficult for us to accept any of his terms without guarantees. On this point, I agree with Prime Minister Chamberlain. I have always advocated adopting a firm stance towards dictators. My policy has not changed in the slightest. However, it is possible to be just as firm in the conference hall as on the battlefield. I am offering advice to the government to ensure that it does not miss any opportunity to achieve Britain's goals through peaceful means. If a hoped-for peace conference is indeed possible, then it is worth trying. If, as discussions progress in the conference hall, it is discovered that Hitler still does not abandon his desire to conquer other countries, then the British government can withdraw from the conference hall and resume fighting. At that point, the world will know that the full responsibility for plunging humanity into war rests with Hitler. Therefore, any opportunity to open peace talks should not be missed. George also strongly urged the government to negotiate with the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Explains War Policy</h3>
<p>Melbourne: Australian Prime Minister Menzies stated in a speech today that unless something unexpected and miraculous happens, this European war will be the greatest battle that Britain has ever engaged in. The war against Germany cannot be considered a victory merely by toppling Hitler. Some say that this war is against one person, and once that person is toppled, the goal of victory is achieved. I do not agree. It must be known that our war is against the doctrine practiced by a government. That government cannot be tolerated if it continues to exist. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British, French, and Turkish Military Talks Conclude; Near East British and French Commanders Return to Defense; Germany Feels Uneasy and is Planning to Deal with It</h3>
<p>Istanbul: French Near East Commander General Weygand and British Near East Commander General Wavell, after holding talks here with Turkish military authorities, returned to their defensive positions by plane this morning. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Military leaders from Britain, France, and Turkey have completed a comprehensive plan for military mutual assistance. The meetings that began on Wednesday concluded today. British Commander-in-Chief of the Near East General Wavell and French Commander-in-Chief of the Near East General Weygand are preparing to fly back to their headquarters. Turkish Chief of Staff General Çakmak stated that the results of the meeting were very satisfactory. It is reported that the military leaders of the three countries decided to cooperate more closely in the Near East. Britain and France have prepared to transport a large number of fighter planes and military supplies to Turkey as soon as possible and provide assistance to the country's Black Sea fleet. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>The Hague: The "Telegraaf" newspaper here recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that after the signing of the British-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Pact, Germany's international position has been hit. It will take active diplomatic action to remedy the situation. It is expected that there will be important developments by the end of this week. German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen, Ambassador to Turkey von Papen, and Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg have all been recalled to the country. After receiving the telegram, Ambassador Mackensen met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for talks and is scheduled to return to Berlin within days. In addition, it is reported that the talks between Germany and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement. If a practical agreement is established in the future, its contents will be kept secret for the time being and will only be announced when the time is ripe. Some sources say that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union may jointly issue a statement expressing their common political plans. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>The Hague: The "Telegraaf" newspaper here recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that after German Chancellor Hitler held all-day talks with military and diplomatic leaders at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, he has ordered the leaders of all Nationalist Socialist Party branches nationwide to go to Berlin to receive instructions in person. This move must be of great importance, because the leaders of the Nationalist Socialist Party branches and the provincial governors were summoned to Berlin to be briefed before the German army invaded Poland. Now that Hitler has again scheduled to meet with the leaders of the Nationalist Socialist Party branches today, it can be asserted that he will take major decisions. Since the establishment of the British-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Pact, Germany has obviously been stimulated and is now intensifying its negotiations with Italy and the Soviet Union. It is expected that the war on the Western Front will soon expand its scope. Although the official circles in the country have been keeping the diplomatic developments of the past few days a strict secret, it is widely rumored in Berlin that the governments of Italy and the Soviet Union have each explained their positions to Germany. In short, Germany's hope that Britain and France would voluntarily announce a truce has been in vain for some time, and it no longer has this hope. Therefore, the anti-British and anti-French propaganda carried out by the country's newspapers, which had been slightly relaxed in recent days, has suddenly become active again this morning. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris: The Soviet government newspaper "Izvestia" published a commentary today stating that the Soviet Union continues to strictly maintain neutrality in the European war and retains freedom of action, etc. French political figures recently commented that the Soviet Union's actions in both Europe and Asia are entirely based on its own interests, and this is another clear proof. Moreover, of all the statements made by the Soviet Union in the seven weeks since the start of the war, this article is "the most realistic" and is appropriately published after the signing of the British-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Pact, and at a time when German Chancellor Hitler has recalled the ambassadors to Turkey, Italy, and the Soviet Union to report on their duties in preparation for dealing with this pact. Its significance is certainly great, because although the Soviet Union has approved the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, it does not consider it a military alliance pact, so it will still act in accordance with its own policies. This can be demonstrated by the country's expansion of its influence in the Baltic region and the start of negotiations with Turkey. As for the Far East, the Soviet Union is now using its power again, but this has nothing to do with Germany. In addition, "Izvestia"'s commentary also has a warning to Turkey, which is exactly the same as the semi-official German warning to Romania not to lightly believe in the assistance that Britain, France, and Turkey can provide. The wording and intention are similar, but it is not possible for Germany and the Soviet Union to act jointly. In short, what Germany wants from the Soviet Union is not limited to neutrality, but the Soviet Union's neutrality policy has now been reaffirmed by "Izvestia." Germany must be frustrated. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Germany's War Aims Against England and France: To Divide the British Empire and Re-allocate World Resources</h3>
<p>Luxembourg City: The "National Daily" newspaper of Koblenz, Germany, today published an editorial, penned by Nazi ideologue, Starhemberg, stating that one of Germany's war aims is to divide the British Empire. "We intend to auction off the various self-governing dominions and protectorates of the Empire. Those who wish to obtain good colonies should come forward. We are reliable salesmen, and anyone who trades with us will surely get what they want. The self-governing dominions and protectorates of the British Empire that we are auctioning off cover a total area of 40 million square kilometers, accounting for 27% of the world's landmass. This is truly an unprecedentedly large transaction." The newspaper also published a huge map of the world on its front page, headlined "Our Inventory and Price List," with various statistics attached, explaining the resources contained within the British Empire. Finally, it stated that Germany's asking price for the land is not very high, only requiring "foreign buyers" to quickly seize the "opportunity to oppose England" and take action. Once the "British inventory" is cleared, they will proceed to auction off French territories. According to the theory propounded by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, the theory of re-allocating world resources is something that Starhemberg has long admired. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Finnish Representatives to Go to Moscow Again; German Economic Delegation Returns to Berlin</h3>
<p>Helsinki: The Finnish national delegation, still led by Paasikivi, departed at 6 PM today to return to Moscow and continue talks with the Soviet authorities. Finnish Minister of Finance, Tanner, also accompanied them. It is reported that the Soviet government had requested Foreign Minister Erkko to go to Moscow. Although Erkko was willing to make every effort to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union without violating neutrality, he did not wish to travel to Moscow, so Minister of Finance Tanner was sent in his place. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Finnish delegation departed for Moscow last night to continue talks that were interrupted a week ago. Finnish Prime Minister Cajander, cabinet ministers, envoys from other Scandinavian countries, the US Minister, and the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires saw them off at the train station. As the choir sang the national anthem, the crowd stood at attention and removed their hats. Chief delegate Paasikivi was visibly moved as he entered the train. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: The content of the Soviet proposal to Finland is not yet known, but it may include a military alliance, which is almost certain to be unacceptable to Finland. This action is sure to receive assistance from the Scandinavian countries. Regarding the final resolution of the Soviet-Finnish issue, it is imperative for the world to know that the validity period of the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Treaty extends until 1945. The first article of the treaty defines aggression as any act of violence that harms the independence or territorial sovereignty of the signatory. Article 5 stipulates that both parties shall only use peaceful means to resolve mutual disputes. From this perspective, there should be no question of the Soviet Union resorting to force. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Moscow: The chief representative of the German economic delegation, Luedde, the Director of the Commercial Department of the Foreign Ministry, has been in Moscow for two weeks for talks with the Soviet authorities and is scheduled to return to Berlin tomorrow. Another representative, Dr. Schnurre, an economic expert from the Foreign Ministry, will remain here for at least another week. According to German sources, the talks are progressing smoothly and an agreement in principle can be reached. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Czech Republic to Form New Government in London; Beneš Eager to Restore the Nation</h3>
<p>London: Former Czechoslovak President Beneš, who recently visited Paris to meet with French government officials, returned here this afternoon. It is reported that the Czech Republic intends to form a new government in London, with Beneš still serving as president. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>Two Former Belgian Prime Ministers Arrive in the US; Advocating for Peace</h3>
<p>Washington: Former Belgian Prime Minister van Zeeland arrived here yesterday, and former Belgian Prime Minister Theunis also arrived in the United States today. He told the press that the purpose of his trip was to study ways to adjust political, economic, and commercial relations between the United States and Belgium. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources in neutral diplomatic circles today, former Belgian Prime Minister van Zeeland has been commissioned by the Nordic countries to go to the United States to request US President Roosevelt to mediate the European war. After receiving the commission, van Zeeland first contacted London twice and also had contacts with the German ambassador in Brussels. Van Zeeland has now gone to the United States, and Hitler is waiting for the results of van Zeeland's activities in the United States. If van Zeeland's activities fail, Hitler will launch a large-scale offensive on the Western Front. It is said that Hitler is determined to break through the Maginot Line, even if it costs the lives of two million people. As for the conditions for peace, the most important thing for Britain and France is to restore the independence of Poland and the Czech Republic. Hitler's conditions are unknown, but according to what he recently said in the German parliament, his demand is to establish a new order based on national geography. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union and Latvia Negotiate Military Treaty; Content Similar to Soviet-Estonian Treaty; Soviet Troops Steadily Enter Estonian Territory for Stationing</h3>
<p>Riga: According to reliable sources, the military talks between Latvia and the Soviet Union that have been going on for a week are now coming to an end. The content is being kept strictly secret by officials. Well-informed sources believe that the Russo-Latvian military treaty is similar in content to the Soviet-Estonian treaty, both stipulating security measures for the entry of Russian troops into Latvian territory, as well as strict control of postal and telecommunications. The exact number of Soviet troops stationed in Latvia has not been announced, nor is it known when Soviet troops will enter Latvia. Only that heavy Soviet troops are stationed at the port of Liepāja. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Riga, Latvia: According to Latvian official sources, the first batch of Soviet warships will visit the port of Liepāja in the next few days. The port has been designated as a Soviet naval base under the Soviet-Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Soviet warships will be stationed at the port. Many Soviet representatives and Latvian officials have departed for Liepāja and Ventspils to determine various issues regarding the boundaries of this base. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tallinn: According to the Estonian Official Gazette, Soviet troops continued to move yesterday to the places in Estonia where they are allowed to station. Troops coming from Narva have now reached their destination. The troops heading to Saaremaa and Hiiumaa are still en route. The troops heading to Irbe camped overnight midway and set off for their destination this morning. Ordinary traffic is temporarily cut off on the roads that Soviet troops must pass through. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Tallinn: Several Soviet submarines arrived here yesterday. These are the Soviet navy following the arrival of the main battle ships and destroyers. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Estonian Prime Minister Gives Speech: Soviet-Estonian Military Cooperation Benefits Both Sides</h3>
<p>Tallinn: Estonian Prime Minister Uluots met with a special correspondent of the Haitong News Agency the day before yesterday and gave a speech on the current situation in Estonia. After the special correspondent of the Haitong News Agency left, it was impossible to use the telephone or telegraph to contact Berlin at that time, and the speech was not sent to Berlin until yesterday. The content of the speech is roughly as follows: "There are many suggestions from the German minority in Estonia. I am deeply convinced that they will still be able to develop their entrepreneurial spirit after moving to a new home. I have great admiration for the contributions made by German scientists at the University of Tartu. In addition to being good at science, the German people also have excellent talents in agricultural work. Regarding the issue of Estonia's sovereignty, now that we have signed a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, sovereignty and independence will not be affected. This is the same as the treaties Estonia has signed with other countries. The obligations accepted do not violate the sovereignty of the country. As for Estonia giving the Soviet Navy a base, this is not without precedent in the international community. The Soviet-Estonian mutual assistance agreement does not restrict Estonia's independent sovereignty. Its essence is to promote close cooperation between the Soviet Union and Estonia in military affairs and jointly respond to external threats. This is in the mutual interest of the Soviet Union and Estonia. The claim that Estonia's jurisdiction will be restricted wherever Soviet troops are stationed is also not true. Wherever Soviet troops are stationed, all transactions and purchases are still based on Estonian law. The Estonian people have always been known for their strong spirit and unity. The more tense the international situation becomes, the more firm the people's hearts in the country become. This alone is enough to maintain Estonia's security." (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<h3>General Elections Scheduled in the Russian Federation</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation has decided to hold elections for the Soviets of Workers' Deputies of all regions, provinces, districts, cities, and villages of the Federation on December 24 this year. Election campaigns will begin on October 24. (TASS, 21st)</p>
<h3>US Senate Ends Debate on Neutrality Act Amendment; Rumor of Roosevelt's Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Washington: As the Senate continued to debate the Neutrality Act Amendment today, Florida Democratic Senator Andrews supported the repeal of the arms embargo clause, stating, "The social and political conditions represented by Hitler and Stalin are deeply abhorrent to us. The conditions represented by England and France are deeply loved by us and are necessary for human peace and freedom. Even if the repeal of the arms embargo clause changes our country's situation from strict neutrality to friendly neutrality, it is worth it. Because the thoughts and policies of England and France are closest to our country, we are unwilling to strictly adhere to neutrality towards them." The Senate then decided that the 23rd of this month would be the end date of the debate, and that on the 24th, each amendment would be put to a vote one by one. Kentucky Democratic Senator Barkley proposed that the various clauses of the Neutrality Act Amendment need not be discussed in detail again so that the bill could be passed as soon as possible. Oregon Republican Senator McNary expressed opposition but said that the Republican Party may agree with the Democratic Party on a method on the 23rd of this month so that the discussion would not be prolonged. The Senate then rejected Barkley's proposal and adjourned.</p>
<p>New York: The Republican New York Voice Forum newspaper recently published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent stating that once the Neutrality Act Amendment proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman is passed, President Roosevelt will reportedly announce that he will not run for re-election next year and will recommend Supreme Court Justice Douglas as his successor. In addition, President Roosevelt may reshuffle his cabinet in the short term to invite two key Republicans to form a national unity cabinet. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>US Plans to Increase Army Personnel; Can Increase to 600,000 Men</h3>
<p>Washington: According to today's news, the War Department has now formulated a detailed plan to increase the US Army by 153,000 men. After this, the regular army and the National Guard can total 600,000 men. It is expected that funds will be allocated early next year to expand the locks of the Panama Canal, making it more difficult for any enemy to block the canal. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<h3>Spain Severely Punishes Unscrupulous Merchants; Military Law Sanctions for Hoarding and Profiteering</h3>
<p>Madrid: A nationwide campaign is now underway in Spain to crack down on hoarding and profiteering. The government claims that 17 people have been found to have hoarded goods and raised prices for profit, and have been fined a total of 2,810,000 pesetas. In addition, there are still those who have been sentenced to fines and short-term imprisonment by local officials. The number of people arrested for raising prices has reached 100. Several textile factory managers in Barcelona have also been arrested. Military trials will begin on Sunday. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Wartime European March - Special Correspondence from London - Shudi</h3>
<p>(1) Propaganda War</p>
<p>The signing of the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact" sent an immediate and significant shock through the international situation in Europe, causing a great deal of confusion in diplomatic circles. What followed on the European international stage was: suspicion, anxiety, panic, and uncertainty. Thus, in this chaotic environment, all kinds of rumors emerged, coupled with propaganda from various quarters for their own purposes. Clearly, the various organizations under the command of German Propaganda Minister Goebbels had gained a new arena of activity. On the Soviet side, Stalin, sitting in the Kremlin, silently puffed on his famous pipe, making a very taciturn appearance. But on the other hand, the organs speaking on behalf of the Soviet Union and the Third International were almost ubiquitous in every corner of the world. The so-called democratic axis of England and France, however, fielded a very organized propaganda line-up, with several major figures. Reuters of the UK, Havas of France, and several news agencies from the US, echoed each other from afar, adding to the fanfare. Naturally, on the surface, these agencies were all private enterprises, but even in peacetime, they were already "semi-official" in nature, let alone in these times?</p>
<p>The tense and sharp diplomatic race has just completed this lap. The result this time was that the diplomacy of the Soviet Union and Germany reached the finish line first. Far behind was the diplomacy of Chamberlain's cabinet in England. So, on this track, is the race over, with no one rushing to catch up? Not at all. As long as we look carefully into the distance again, we can immediately see that there are still people rushing forward with all their might: (1) Daladier of France with his so-called "absolute no concessions." (2) Churchill, Eden, Halifax, and others from England with their so-called "smashing power politics." (3) Polish Foreign Minister Beck is also running there, but while running, he keeps hesitating and looking around; and from time to time he turns his head to greet Mussolini. (4) Mussolini of Italy, this time, also joined the race. However, his main purpose is to promote Hitler's victory. His main task: first, to persuade others not to run anymore, as it is futile; second, to shout loudly in alarm, disrupting the sightlines of the participants and spectators; and finally, if necessary, he probably intends to imitate the style of a hooligan on a sports field, lying down on the track and tripping other participants so that Hitler can win. US President Roosevelt, this time, did not join, but simply shouted loudly from the sidelines, acting as a cheerleader for the English and French athletes. — This analogy is a concise summary of the recent diplomatic competition between European countries.</p>
<p>Behind this diplomatic picture, however, lies the large-scale mobilization of various countries for future wars. Some estimate that the total number of people mobilized in Europe today is over ten million. But the actual number is far more than that! If we include non-combatant personnel directly participating in the war, then the number must be at least over one hundred million! An example before our eyes is London. The number of people mobilized for the war, both active and passive defense personnel, must be at least over 500,000. Broadly speaking, Europe is entirely mobilized for the future war. A true and veritable "total mobilization!"</p>
<p>But compared to diplomacy and military affairs, in recent days, what has been most vigorously launched in Europe on the surface is the propaganda war between the countries.</p>
<p>After the signing of the Soviet-German Pact, there were at least a hundred different versions of its content in Europe! As for the extent of its possible impact, the divergence was even greater than this number!</p>
<p>For example. According to the unanimous inference of observers with vision and knowledge, it is reliable that the Soviet-German Pact included a message that both countries would, in any case, leave a buffer zone. The British and French authorities and the press were fully aware of this; but when it appeared in speech and writing, it became "The Soviet Union and Germany agree to partition Poland!"</p>
<p>Also, for example, the Soviet-German Pact was clearly aimed at the English "Chamberlain Cabinet's policy" of provoking war between Germany and the Soviet Union. The negotiations for this pact were not done overnight, and the English people with general knowledge had long warned their government of its possible success. Its intention, without a doubt, was to establish a buffer between each other. But when the propaganda organs of England and France spoke of it, they simply said, "The Soviet Union and Germany have formed an alliance!"</p>
<p>Is a Soviet-German "alliance" possible? Will they establish a tacit understanding to "partition" Poland? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Situation in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania Before the Outbreak of the European War (Continued)</h3>
<p>— London Times - Translated by Boming</p>
<p>Both countries considered the Soviet Union's proposal to guarantee them assistance in the event of an attack to be incompatible with their policy of neutrality, because Germany would interpret this action by the two countries as joining a "peace front", which is what Germany called "encirclement". If England, France and the Soviet Union were to assist any country (not specifying the Baltic states) that was invaded and sought assistance, then the Baltic states would not object. However, they considered the Soviet Union's proposed guarantee to be a provocative move, and argued that the security of the Baltic states was only a pretext for the Soviet Union's policy of seeking certain benefits that conflicted with the interests of the two countries. The Soviet Union admitted that it was afraid that Germany would land in Latvia and Estonia and then attack the Soviet Union, but in the past three years, the Red Army had built what was said to be an impregnable "Soviet Maginot Line" along the entire previously undefended border. The term "Baltic states" also includes Lithuania, the third small republic that makes up the Baltic Entente. Lithuanians and Latvians are both of Indo-European descent, while Estonians are of the same race as Finns. Lithuania has a common land border with Germany, but not with the Soviet Union, which is different from Estonia and Latvia, so it is not included in the Soviet Union's proposed guarantee. In the twenty years of their existence, Estonia and Latvia have not had disputes with any neighboring countries. However, Lithuania was less fortunate, and until recently, was still at odds with Poland over Vilnius and with Germany over Memel. Estonia and Latvia formed an alliance soon after 1920, but Lithuania did not join until 1934 because of these disputes, thus forming the Baltic Entente. Lithuania clearly excluded the disputes over Vilnius and Memel from the scope of this entente, so Lithuania was forced to resolve these issues in isolation. However, there are no more "special issues" of this nature at present. These three republics are now linked by negotiation and present a common front to the outside world. However, Lithuania was not present at the signing of the non-aggression pact in Berlin because the treaty that Lithuania concluded with Germany when it ceded Memel in March already included the country's non-aggression pact.</p>
<p>All three republics have separately and collectively announced that they will remain neutral when neighboring countries are at war, and will only fight to defend their own independence. The three countries will fight together against the country that first violates their neutrality. However, the three countries are unwilling to predict whether they will accept foreign aid, because the three countries believe that such a hypothetical arrangement conflicts with their strict neutrality.</p>
<p>The Baltic states alone cannot offer much resistance to Germany or the Soviet Union. However, the army of any country, whose main force is fighting on the other side, cannot ignore the combined forces of the three countries. The combined population of the three countries is 5.5 million (Estonia 1.131 million, Latvia 2 million, Lithuania 2.1 million), and the standing army is 60,000 (Estonia 12,000, Latvia 25,000, Lithuania 23,000). The three entente countries have implemented universally adopted compulsory military service throughout their territories, and their land forces can quickly expand to 500,000 men. The troops have received excellent training, and many officers have gained additional experience overseas, and well-organized auxiliary groups can almost immediately transform the three republics into three armed countries.</p>
<p>The human quality of the three countries is excellent. Many of the older reservists fought alongside their fathers and grandfathers when they were teenagers. The war twenty years ago gave them their independence and gave them their own territories, where they established their families. If these families are invaded or threatened, then now that they have the convenience of being well-dressed, well-trained, and well-equipped, they will at least fight as their grandfathers did when they did not have their own land to defend. The current presidents of the three countries, Päts of Estonia, Ulmanis of Latvia, and Smetona of Lithuania, who managed their republics through the recent constitutional reforms, were the first class of people who led the nation into independence twenty years ago.</p>

<h3>Fujian Province to Subsidize Unemployed Skilled Workers, Starting with Fuzhou: Principles for Accommodation Determined</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In coastal counties of Fujian Province, the number of unemployed has been increasing due to the impact of the war. Ordinary refugees, women, and children, as well as those suitable for land reclamation, have been actively provided relief and evacuated by the Provincial Relief Committee and the Agricultural Improvement Bureau, reaching over 130,000 people. Now, the Department of Construction is also formulating measures to provide assistance and resettlement to production and technical personnel who are unemployed or have moved inland, such as those in the machinery, electrical, glass, hardware, textile, civil engineering, carving, printing, paint, rattan and bamboo, mining, and other sectors, in collaboration with relevant agencies. Fuzhou is designated as the first phase for implementation, with the intention of extending it to coastal counties. Production and technical personnel who meet the above criteria can apply for registration with the local county government, which will report to the Department of Construction. The Department of Construction will then convene relevant agencies to discuss accommodation and resettlement measures, based on the following principles: (1) The Changting Office of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Association will guide the organization of industrial cooperative groups to maintain business and livelihoods, distributing them as much as possible to designated centers. (2) The Department of Construction will allocate them to the Highway Engineering Bureau, various Public Works Bureaus, brick and tile factories, repair shops, cotton weaving factories, electrical factories, oil lamp factories, iron factories, and civil engineering sites as technicians or apprentices. (3) The original manufacturers moving inland will accommodate them as much as possible. (4) The Refugee Production Enterprise Management Office will accommodate a portion in various refugee factories, with the principle of maintaining livelihoods. (5) The Provincial Relief Committee will provide temporary accommodation for employees who do not have work, to facilitate their allocation to various factories. (6) Intellectual employees who become unemployed due to factory relocation may be assigned to popular education training work (this point will be handled by the Department of Education). As for the relocation of unemployed employees, the measures are set as follows: (1) The management agency will handle the inland relocation in batches within a specified period. The management agency will be handled by the Provincial Relief Committee in conjunction with the Department of Construction. A: Walking to the designated location. B: Shipping with a 50% discount. C: Transportation by vehicle with a 40% discount. (2) The local government is responsible for providing accommodation, whether passing through or reaching the destination. (3) The management agency will統籌 provide food. Regarding fundraising, it is divided into the following points: (1) Self-sufficiency for a part or all, to be raised by the workers themselves. (2) Borrowing a part or all, available for loan based on the loan method for those without cash. (3) Providing a part or all, when considered an unreasonable burden, a subsidy may be requested. The source of funds will be allocated by the provincial government or advanced from the relief fund by the Relief Committee.</p>
<h3>Fierce Street Fighting in Xitang Town, Jiashan; Heavy Civilian Casualties; Shops Looted</h3>
<p>Jiashan Correspondence: On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, the Chinese army's ××× division ××× regiment counterattacked Fengjing, engaging in a battle with the Japanese army near No. 1 Yang Bridge for eight hours. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. The next day, the Japanese army reinforced with 1,500 troops from Jiaxing, Wujiang, Jiashan, and other places, and identified Xitang as an anti-Japanese base. They then, guided by Xu Pucheng's puppet pacification troops, invaded in five routes. They engaged in fierce street fighting with the Chinese army in Xijie, near the Shanshan-West Highway. The Chinese army withdrew from Xitang, and the Japanese army tracked them down to the west of Xitang Town, to places like Fanjing, Xiadianmiao, and Tianningzhuang, searching for the Chinese army. They砍 killed anyone they encountered, regardless of gender, with blood flowing like a river and cries shaking the sky. Four Japanese planes also flew to Xitang Town and repeatedly bombed residential areas such as Shaoxianggang, Fenghong Alley, and Wufu Bridge, mixed with several sulfur bombs. In an instant, flames soared into the sky, and no one could extinguish them, bombing and burning more than 20 civilians to death, their limbs scattered in a horrific scene. Before the Japanese army arrived in Xitang, it seemed that planned disturbances were pre-arranged. The Japanese army was mixed with many bandits, ruffians, and puppet police. After arriving in Xitang, they forced the bandits and puppet police to loot large and small shops, filling the汽艇 launches with boxes and籠 cases. At the same time, they also took away eight respectable women from Jiashan, including Xu Longzhen, to organize the so-called "嘉　Women's Anti-Communist Group Temporary Propaganda Team," which posted slogans and gave speeches in the streets and alleys.</p>
<h3>Abundant Autumn Silkworm Harvest in Wuxi Rural Areas; Estimated Yield of Over 6,000擔</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: For more than two years since the war of resistance, farmers in the occupied areas have fortunately experienced abundant harvests of rice and wheat, and smooth silkworm farming. In the guerrilla areas and towns where the oppression of the Japanese puppets is difficult to reach, the rural situation has improved. Wuxi has always been a famous sericulture area, and farmers in the four rural areas all regard silkworm breeding as their only sideline. This year's spring and autumn cocoon seasons have seen silkworm farmers sell their cocoons at unprecedented high prices, further increasing their interest in silkworm breeding. Recently, they have also been raising late autumn silkworms, and with the warm weather in recent days, the silkworms have been developing very quickly. It is estimated that the harvest will be over 80%, and the total output of the county will be more than 6,000擔 of fresh cocoons. If calculated at the current market price of 300 yuan per fresh cocoon, the rural areas of the county will increase their income by 2 million yuan. Recently, most have already completed 簇, and general silk cocoon merchants are sending people to the countryside to prepare to collect cocoons. At the same time, the price of fertilizers, which are indirectly related to silkworm breeding, has also soared. Because a few years ago, villagers abandoned silkworm breeding as a sideline due to low cocoon prices, and most of the original mulberry fields were turned into rice fields. Even those mulberry fields that have not been converted to rice have not been fertilized again. Therefore, the value of fertilizers in rural areas has plummeted. Now that villagers have increased their interest in breeding, they have paid more attention to irrigating mulberry trees, and since they have eaten expensive leaves this year, silkworm farmers mostly hope to have their own mulberry trees to increase production. Therefore, the issue of fertilization has become particularly important. Under this situation of demand exceeding supply, the price of fertilizers in rural areas has also risen sharply, with top-quality raw materials requiring 3角 per擔, and ordinary materials requiring more than 2角. Most villagers go to the city to collect manure, but problems arise for those who enter the city without a county resident certificate.</p>

<h3>Overview of Moral Education in Higher Education Nationwide (4): The Organization of the Three Principles of the People Youth League</h3>
<p>In addition to individual guidance, the guidance method should fully utilize after-school and holiday time to gather students in this group for discussions, seminars, and outings to conduct moral education for group living. Each group advisor should hold a guidance meeting once a month to report on the implementation of guidance in each group and to study common issues related to guidance. The guidance meeting is chaired by the president. If the president is unable to attend due to circumstances, the chief advisor or the director of moral education may represent the chair. If the advisor believes that a student is incorrigible, they may request the president to approve withdrawal from guidance. The student who is withdrawn will have the school select another advisor. If the student is withdrawn again, the school will remove them from the rolls. When students graduate, the advisor should issue a certificate of guidance, briefly evaluating the student's thoughts, behavior, and graduation. This certificate may be accessed by relevant parties at any time when the student applies for further education or employment. The Ministry of Education will assign inspectors to supervise the implementation of the advisor system in each school and report on it specifically. The provincial and municipal education departments should also send inspectors to supervise and guide it at any time.</p>
<p>Since the advisor system is a new initiative, sufficient consideration must be given to effective implementation in advance. Therefore, when the Outline of the Advisor System for Secondary and Higher Education Institutions was promulgated, the points to be paid attention to when implementing this system were listed for the reference of each school.</p>
<p>(1) Each school should have the determination to implement the advisor system effectively and should not do it perfunctorily. School presidents, advisors, and student parents should pay more attention and maintain close contact.</p>
<p>(2) The president should be extremely cautious in selecting advisors, not only emphasizing academic knowledge but also taking into account moral character, making them role models for students. Student grouping should pay attention to age, academic ability, and conduct, and the methods should be determined based on the actual situation.</p>
<p>(3) Advisors should lead by example, and all words and actions should serve as models for students. They should deeply understand the student's personality and provide opportunities for those with special talents to develop them. Although the relationship between advisors and students should be as cordial as possible, the dignity of the teacher should be maintained.</p>
<p>(4) Student parents should also be responsible for the promotion of the advisor system, reporting the child's personality and behavior at home to the advisor at any time so that the advisor has a basis for implementing guidance and should respect the advisor system.</p>
<p>Although the advisor system originated from the old system of teachers and scholars and the methods of famous universities in Europe and the West, its concrete promulgation and implementation through laws and regulations is an innovation. Since the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline of the Advisor System for Secondary and Higher Education Institutions and the Points to be Paid Attention to in Implementing the Advisor System last March, each school was required to implement it starting from the 27th academic year and report on the implementation at any time. Originally, since this system was an innovation, each school's implementation was very temporary, and the influence of moral education is subtle and its effect is slow. In addition, a small number of schools were affected by the war, so it is difficult to expect significant results at present. Here is an overview of the implementation of the advisor system by the schools that have reported.</p>
<p>(1) Signing of Rules and Regulations and Forms: At the beginning of this academic year, each school drafted detailed rules for the implementation of the advisor system in accordance with the Outline of the Advisor System and the Points to be Paid Attention to in Implementing the Advisor System. The schools that have reported these detailed rules include National Central University, Wuhan University, Jinan University, Sun Yat-sen University, Tongji University, Northeastern University, Sichuan University, Fudan University, Daxia University, Wuchang Zhonghua University, Lingnan University, Guangdong National University, West China Union University, Tangshan Engineering College, Shanghai Medical College, Zhongzheng Medical College, Jiangsu Medical College, Gansu College, Jiangsu Provincial College of Education, Sichuan Provincial College of Education, Shanghai College of Political Science and Law, Chaoyang College, Shanghai Law College, Fujian Union College, Fujian College, National Pharmaceutical College, National Martial Arts and Physical Education College, Jiangxi Provincial Industrial College, and Wuchang Wenhua Library College, a total of 29 schools. Except for a few detailed rules that were slightly modified, the rest were approved for record. However, each has varying degrees of complexity, with some having as many as 22 articles, such as National Sun Yat-sen University, and some having as few as seven articles, such as Sichuan Provincial College of Education.</p>
<p>(2) Appointment of Advisors: At the beginning of this academic year, each school appointed several advisors according to the number of student groups to be responsible for guidance. The method of appointment is by the president from among the full-time teachers. In some cases, due to the insufficient number of full-time teachers or due to female students, moral education staff and female student advisors were appointed as advisors, such as at Jiangsu Medical College. Each school has one chief advisor. In special cases, there are four, such as Sichuan University, or there are deputy chief advisors, such as Wuhan University and National Central University. There are also chief advisors at each level, such as Shanghai Medical College. Chief advisors are mostly concurrently held by the Director of Moral Education or the Dean of Academic Affairs, some are concurrently held by the president, such as Sichuan University, and some are held by other faculty members, such as Wuhan University. In addition to stipulating the establishment of guidance meetings, some schools have established a Research Committee for the Implementation of the Advisor System to improve the implementation of the advisor system, such as Jinan University.</p>

<h3>Two Preliminary Football Matches: Lido and Donghua Both Win; Donghua Defeats French Business School, Wan Xianghua Scores a Hat-Trick; Lido Shuts Out North China Children's School with Four Goals</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no fewer than 5,000 fans at Jiaozhou Park, as the two powerhouses of the Chinese teams, Donghua and Lido, battled the French Business School and the North China Children's School, respectively. These double features were well worth the price of two角法幣. As a result of the matches, Donghua defeated the French Business School 3-1, while Lido defeated the North China Children's School 4-0.</p>
<p>Donghua's Victory</p>
<p>After Donghua and the French Business School交锋 fought yesterday, both sides defended extremely tightly. Donghua's offense was more intense, but good opportunities were lost, resulting in 35 minutes of wasted time. The first half ended in a 0-0 tie. After the restart, Donghua finally broke the deadlock with a goal by Wan Xianghua. Five minutes later, A Wan returned to his old haunt, giving Donghua a 2-0 lead. Four minutes later, French Business School's left-back, Ge Qinggu, broke through the center and lobbed a shot from 30 yards away, which flew into the corner of the net. Gu Biao was unable to reach it, and they lost a goal. In the final minute, Xianghua single-handedly dribbled past three defenders and hit the target, completing his hat-trick and taking care of the entire match. Donghua won 3-1.</p>

<p>Lido's Masterpiece</p>
<p>Following Donghua, Lido took to the field against the North China Children's School. The North China Children's School came with all their strength, deploying甲組 fighters on their defensive and offensive lines. Lido's Sun, Li, and Zhang also took to the field, so it was almost the same as an甲組 match. Just three minutes after 交锋, Li Yichen received a brilliant pass from Sun Jinshun and took advantage of Roberts'冲 out opportunity to hit the empty net (1-0). Seven minutes later, Li Yichen passed to Hui Rongzhong, who hit the left corner from close range (2-0). Lido's offense was very strong, but Roberts' goal守身手 was exceptionally agile, so Sun and Li's several fierce shots were all blocked into corner kicks. The first half ended 2-0. After the restart, the game remained deadlocked for a long time, and the situation was very dull. In one instance, Li Yichen fired a fierce shot from 15 yards away, and Roberts, having already扑空空, rolled on the ground and grasped it again, which was very exciting. In the 23rd minute, Li Yichen hooked and turned on the baseline, landing right next to the post. At that time, Roberts and Yichen fell into a pile. Touner retreated to block, but Shen Shangde had already poked it into the empty 鬥 (3-0). In the last three minutes, Le Xiuhua kicked out a corner kick, Zhang Linggen衝 out挑射 and Li Yichen intercepted it, completing the full功 with a 4-0 victory. Lido celebrated.</p>

<p>In the西聯 football match yesterday, East Seletar and West Guards played the 甲組 match at Yiyuan in the morning.

Therefore, the逸園 court was quite lively yesterday morning. West Guards played more stubbornly than in previous years, but the British army is now different from what it was. The frontline is progressing exceptionally quickly, and its momentum seems to surpass西福斯. However, the defense was slightly negligent yesterday, resulting in almost half a dozen goals conceded. Fortunately, the activity of the frontline allowed them to secure the final victory with an 8-5 score. East Seletar led 4-3 in the first half.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>A Comparative View of the Economic Power of Britain, France, and Germany in Wartime</h3>
<p>— Nan Rou</p>
<p>The Second World War, which had been talked about for many years, finally became a tragic reality a month ago. What will be the outcome of this war that has finally arrived? This is a question everyone is eager to know.</p>
<p>However, to predict the outcome of this European war, the first prerequisite is the scope of the belligerent countries. How long can Italy's neutrality last? And the attitude of the Soviet Union, the movements of the United States, the allegiances of the Balkan countries, and the future of the British and French colonies are all still unclear. If the two opposing groups formed by the belligerent countries joining forces with other countries in the future are too unbalanced in power, the outcome of the war will be easy to judge. However, if the two sides are evenly matched, the duration and scale of the war will inevitably be prolonged and expanded. Since this point is still unknown, the material for making an objective judgment must be said to be extremely lacking.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the above conditions, let us talk about the second prerequisite, which is the question of knowing the duration of the war first, that is, whether it is a short-term war or a long-term war? This question is a more important factor than the first prerequisite in comparing the war economic power of both sides. Just in terms of this, because the characteristic of modern warfare is the so-called long-term war that requires comparing the national economic power and spiritual power of the belligerent countries to the last drop, so this war will continue for four years or more like the last World War, although it is impossible to predict, but judging from the current situation, long-termization is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Since it is recognized that this war has the inevitability of turning into a long-term war, we must take this as the starting point of our argument to try to compare the war economic power of Britain, France, and Germany. However, it should be noted that what is described below is only a number of indicators, and new perspectives will be developed depending on the actions of neutral countries.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the economic system for war preparation. Regarding this point, Germany's defense economy system seems to be stronger than the system of the democratic countries Britain and France. However, it is an undeniable fact that Germany hopes for a "quick victory" due to economic reasons, but at least in terms of the economic system for war preparation, it has indeed been working hard for a long time to establish a so-called long-term national defense economy system to cope with long-term wars. For example, various educational and administrative measures regarding the war economy have already been started; labor mobilization, economic armament, and the cell organization and group organization of the economy have also been quite successful; even regarding industrial mobilization, the dispersion of industrial centers and the withdrawal from the border to the hinterland have already been started. And the most important thing is to consider the isolation during wartime, so it is trying to reduce the external dependence on food and raw materials as much as possible, and strive to maintain wartime export trade and conclude wartime trade relations, etc., and has made a lot of efforts in these areas. The so-called "New Four-Year Plan" that began in 1936 is a clear expression of this. The basic principle hidden in its policies is to try not to repeat the failures of the First World War.</p>
<p>Looking at Britain and France, what is the situation? Of course, since Britain passed the huge national defense budget for the 1936 fiscal year, it has indeed been seeking various measures regarding war preparation in the economic aspect. However, its measures have always stood on the basis of a peaceful economy, and the political and business circles have always opposed "placing industry under a wartime system." However, in view of the urgency of the crisis, the "National Defense Full Powers Act" passed in the parliament on August 24 is an important law that entrusts the government with full powers to operate the wartime economy, which is comparable to Germany's full powers delegation legislation, but it was only ten days before the declaration of war when British gentlemen threw away their umbrellas and took such a big step.</p>
<p>France also only began to rapidly enter the preparation for a wartime system a year ago, and formulated the epoch-making "National General Mobilization Law" last July in preparation for the outbreak of war. However, the chronic instability of the French political situation has also cast a large shadow on the wartime formation of industrial organizations, and the accumulation of war economic potential has not made much progress.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the wartime self-sufficiency rate of food and raw materials, etc., which is the most important issue in the combination of war and economy. To be honest, it is impossible for any country, whether Britain, France, or Germany, to support a long-term war with domestic production alone; although there are differences in degree, they all need to rely on foreign supplements. So it is possible to say this: in a long-term war, whoever can ensure the supply routes of their foreign food and raw materials, etc., will win.</p>
<p>Germany's food self-sufficiency rate has made a lot of progress in recent years due to Hitler's efforts to increase production, which cannot be denied, and storage policies have also been carried out quite extensively; however, the shortage of important mineral resources such as petroleum for military raw materials is also an undeniable weakness. Therefore, it is a natural trend to try to flatter the Soviet Union and want to rely on the Soviet Union's granary, mines, and oil fields. Similarly, Britain and France must also rely on their overseas colonies for supply; like Britain, if there is no colonial supply of food and raw materials, I am afraid that even a few months of war economy cannot be maintained? Therefore, striving to ensure its sea transport routes has become an absolutely important golden rule in wartime.</p>
<p>In terms of food and raw material replenishment, Britain and France have strengths that Germany cannot match, which is that they have a large amount of cash and exchange reserves. Some people take this as the basis for the victory of Britain and France, and place it on the fact that cash and exchange reserves are absolutely superior to Germany, which is inevitably close to extremism; however, the effectiveness of gold in wartime cannot be underestimated. The saying "money makes the mare go" can still be applied to war within a considerable range, because countries with higher cash holdings can obtain the supply of materials from third countries in emergencies and lead the war to their advantage. Especially the current Germany, which is famous for being "poor," although Nazi spokespersons advertise that they have "secret" war reserve funds stored, but no matter what, Germany's cash and exchange reserves are far inferior to Britain and France, which is an undeniable fact. If we put aside other conditions, judging from this point alone, Germany is not a match for Britain and France after all.</p>
<p>However, it is not possible to grasp the truth by looking at the urgent measures taken by both sides after the outbreak of war and using them as a measure of war economic power. For example, as soon as this war broke out, Germany quickly implemented the quantitative allocation of major foods. Some people saw this and immediately intuitively thought that there was a food shortage, which is inappropriate. Because this can only be considered as the implementation of war accounting plans researched and prepared in peacetime based on the experience of the last World War.</p>
<p>However, judging from the situation in the one month or so since the outbreak of war, Germany is unfavorable for a long-term war, while Britain and France are in a favorable position in a long-term war. And according to the characteristics of modern warfare, there is an inevitable destiny to enter a long-term war, so logically, this war will not be won by Germany after all. This is naturally just a deduction based on the current situation. However, even if the attitude of neutral countries changes in the future, as long as the strength of the group that aids Britain and France is not weaker than that of the group that aids Germany, and they can ensure their transport routes with the Allied countries and colonies, Britain and France will definitely have the certainty of victory; moreover, due to the development of the war situation, Germany has the danger of internal collapse peculiar to a dictatorial country!</p>
<h3>US Cotton Converted to Chinese Currency Price</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Fangren: Your letter inquiring about the price of US cotton and Indian cotton converted into Chinese currency has been received. I will first briefly answer the item of the US cotton conversion method as follows, and I will describe the rest in detail in the next issue.</p>
<p>(1) The unit of quotation for US cotton is pounds and US cents, so one party should convert US dollars into national currency, and the other party should convert pounds into market dan, the formula is</p>
<p>(2) You suspect that the October US cotton price of 9.12 cents on the 18th, after conversion, does not match the converted national currency price published in the Xinwenbao (News Daily) on the same day, suspecting that the price published in the newspaper may include freight and tariffs. Because the market price you listed above does not match the price published in this newspaper and the Xinwenbao on the same day, it is impossible to verify. However, the result of conversion according to the above calculation method does not match the price published in the Xinwenbao. Because the difference is not far, it can be known that the converted price published in the newspaper does not include additional fees. The reason for the difference may be that the US exchange rate used for calculation is different?</p>
<p>According to the Xinwenbao on the 21st (because the newspaper had no conversion yesterday), the spot price of US cotton on the 19th was 9.28 cents, and the closing price of the Shanghai to US exchange rate on the 20th was 7.59375 yuan per 100 yuan of national currency (that is, 1 US dollar equals 13.169 cents of national currency), then the price of US cotton per market zu equals 134.67 yuan of national currency, which does not match the converted price of 131.80 yuan published in the newspaper on the same day. Because of the rush of typesetting and the reporter's lack of knowledge, please allow experts in this publication to reply in detail in the next issue.</p>

<h3>The Past Week</h3>
<p>The position of speculators is getting worse. Compare the market conditions on the first and last days of this week: buying British exchange loses at least 1.75 yuan per pound, and buying US dollars loses at least 60 cents per dollar. If you buy foreign currency instead of bills of exchange, each unit will lose at least 1 to 3 yuan or more. In addition, buying cash loses at least 60 yuan per bar; hoarding yarn loses at least 52 yuan per bale of 20-count Double Horse; and each dan of Tongzhou cotton loses at least 45 yuan. The bull camp has been completely defeated. However, buying public bonds makes money. For example, E has risen by 70 cents, and there is a difference of more than 1 yuan between the high and low peaks. You get the patriotic reputation and also make money! It couldn't be better! Looking back since the outbreak of the war, only the bond market has been relatively stable in the speculative world. There are countless reasons, and the fact that the bulls must do it to the end is also one of the main reasons. Because of this, the domestic bond market has become the most appropriate and reliable place to invest!</p>
<p>After Britain, France, and Turkey signed the "Mutual Assistance Agreement," the Soviet Union and Turkey exchanged congratulatory telegrams. Could this be another new factor for the Soviet Union to get rid of the European conflict? It was reported in The Hague that conflicts between Mongolia and "Manchukuo" and Japan and the Soviet Union have occurred again, although it has not been confirmed, but at least it can match the above speculation. And US Ambassador to Japan Grew's speech, US Secretary of State Hull's righteous words on the Shanghai Concession and the promise to provide substantial assistance, have further clarified the situation in the Far East. At the same time, the heroic advance of the Chinese army on all fronts, frequent good news, and the Japanese side's indiscriminate release of peace rhetoric, wanting to make a golden cicada escape its shell, all of these make the market's morale excited and firm! Therefore, it is predicted that the market atmosphere this week will be even better! (Must be given)</p>
<p>Since the first half of 1938, Shanghai's prices have gradually increased, and the recent price increases have been even worse, and people's lives feel extremely difficult. In recent days, prices have shown a downward trend. This is because this European war is different from the last World War, both in terms of time and space. The source of foreign goods has not been cut off, and the goods transported from the occupied areas are not as difficult as expected, so in theory, prices will only fall day by day; however, speculators are still unwilling to sell their hoarded goods, wanting to wait for a good opportunity. But, with a little thought, the period of rising prices has passed, and the golden dream of speculation can no longer be realized. Moreover, you must know that prices far exceed the purchasing power of the people, and there will never be a sale in your lifetime! (Yi Su)</p>
<p>After the start of the European war, trade between the belligerent countries and China was greatly affected, and imports sharply decreased. In September, the import amount of the Shanghai Customs was 48,816,916 yuan, and the export amount was 66,711,080 yuan. The phenomenon of changing from an import surplus to an export surplus is a good phenomenon for the entire national trade and a great help to the revival of the nation. In the future, we will try our best to reject and not use consumer-based imported goods, and at the same time strive to produce to increase exports, and the future will be more optimistic!

<h3>Reply to Mr. Chen Zhimin</h3>
<p>— Pan Chuandong</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the point of what the purpose of your letter is, I think that the first part of your book says that operating regular transactions can be the most profitable, and at the same time, the second half explains the method, which seems to be intended to instruct speculation methods. I think that operating regular transactions is not the most profitable method, but a method to facilitate industry and commerce to avoid the danger of price fluctuations. Industry and commerce estimate the quantity of raw materials or commodities, pre-purchase or pre-sell on the market to avoid unfavorable changes in the market price in the future, which is one of the purposes of speculation. Or, if you want to sell commodities in the future, you will first sell standard products and then replenish them when you sell spot goods in the future. In this way, the profit and loss in the speculative market will offset the profit and loss when the spot goods are sold, in order to avoid unfavorable changes in the market price, which is the second purpose of speculation, and also the most important purpose. I will not quote facts again. Therefore, our country's laws stipulate that the establishment of an exchange must be initiated by the industry, and the gold brokerage people must be members of the guild, that is, operating regular business is for the convenience of the industry, not a method for outsiders to get rich.</p>
<p>At the same time, even if it is considered that buying short and selling short can be the most profitable business, I believe that the method indicated in your book is not very sufficient and not very complete. The buying and selling methods described in the second part of your book, I think, are made for instruction. If it is to describe the buying and selling unit and calculate the price rise and fall, then I don't know how to describe the percentage and order of the buying and selling. But I don't know what the method indicated in your book means. Because general speculative professionals must have known this method. If it is used to guide outsiders, it seems dangerous. I am afraid that outsiders will speculate according to the method shown, so I will clarify it. Now speculation is very popular, no matter what, there must be people who do not quite understand the essentials of speculation. (Speculators or brokers are not included). Therefore, it is thought that the works instructing speculation methods have the danger of being misused. Your original intention must not be to make people misuse it. But it is not necessarily guaranteed that it will not be misused. Therefore, I am in Zhadaiming's book, which cannot be the blueprint for speculation. My intention lies in this. It seems not to be a slander. I don't know if you think you can speculate according to your book? If you can't speculate, and you still need other knowledge and experience, it is no different from saying, "The method described in this book is a speculation method. But it is still necessary to look at your wealth, wisdom and personality to decide." It is not contradictory to describe in detail the methods of speculation in various items and also say that this method cannot be used for speculation. I think that if you want to clarify the nature of speculation, you should describe the organization of the exchange, its benefits, and the status and duties of buyers, sellers, and brokers. And you should avoid a specific description of the speculation method. If you want to clarify the method of speculation, you should also explain the statistics that can be obtained when drawing lines and speculating in various items, (such as the Tao Qiong Division's average number of foreign shares and the books and publications printed and sent by foreign brokers). It also seems that specific methods should be avoided. To avoid being misused. Now the method shown in your book is very specific, and it is not stated that it cannot be used in practice, then how can it be avoided to be misused? And if you say that according to the words in the section on conservative methods in your book, it has been stated that it cannot be applied, then how can you explain the meaning of writing the book?</p>
<p>(2) The evidence cited is that speculation must have financial and intellectual resources. This statement does not seem to be a theory, but a fact. The reply has been admitted. This statement does not seem to be abolished because it cites the words of others. Moreover, I did not say that theory and fact can coincide. Therefore, I once said that having financial and intellectual resources (that is, theory) still requires experience (that is, fact) to use it successfully. Therefore, it does not mean that a specialist graduate can speculate. In fact, specialist graduates often do not speculate, because they know the danger of its failure. A smile.</p>
<p>(3) I have absolutely no intention of despising professional professionals with vast experience like you, on the contrary, I deeply admire them. However, the closer the theory of the book instructing speculation written by experts is to the facts, the less I dare to agree, because speculation is almost a business that cannot be instructed in words.</p>
<p>(4) I am really ignorant of the meaning of the two words "zuozhi" or "jiezhi" (作制，節制). I don't know what you mean by using it to prove the meaning of my buying and selling. But I don't pay attention to Du Zhong's fragments of words. Even if there are words such as "must be discussed with those who are familiar with it" in your book, I think your book is a book instructing speculation. (It is difficult to explain the meaning of your writing). And the one who recklessly "slanders" (雌黃) is also here.</p>
<p>(5) Since the reply did not mention the other points, there is no need to mention them again. In short, I think that the speculation of general people without special knowledge is not beneficial to individuals and society. And your book is a book instructing speculation, and there is a danger that it will be misused by the outside world as a speculation method. Is this statement appropriate? Let the public and you consider it. It is not that I will reply to this statement, and I will not argue anymore after that. (Que Chou)</p>

Later, it was seen that the sources from all roads were still only transported by wheels to the original packages of more than 3,000 packages, and the customers were also very determined to sell, so the local customers began to take action, but the eating plate was not as relaxed as before. As a result, only 6,000 to 7,000 packages were traded. The prices of various goods were mostly unchanged.

<p>Sexual Health</p>
<h3>Regarding Life Happiness</h3>
<p>— Russian Labor University Medical Graduate Yang Daonan</p>
<p>Principles of Reproduction and Hygiene</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly understand the origin, transformation, and mechanical action of the principles of reproduction, it is useless to first understand its structural connection in the brain center. The brain center is located in the human brain. Through afferent and efferent nerves, it is connected to the spinal center of the sexual nerves, indirectly controlling local activities. Externally, it is connected to the functions of vision and hearing, so seeing beautiful women and listening to decadent sounds are enough to cause impulses. Fortunately, because our energy and brainpower are often concentrated in daily life, physiological reflexes and impulses are often latent in the subconscious and cannot show their activities. Only when we are full and warmly dressed, do nothing, and think of lewdness, will this impulse appear in the conscious world. Therefore, clearing the heart and reducing desires is the way to restrain desires and preserve life.</p>
<p>Young people are often confused by lewd books and paintings due to their weak will, and often commit the bad habit of self-pity, which leads to nervous disorders and reduced physical strength, spermatorrhea, neurasthenia. However, there is a method that can be promoted as a reasonable principle in science, which can restrain the reckless movement of reproduction, that is, what the ancients called self-cultivation, rectifying the heart, and sincerity. The implementation method can often make the mind concentrate on the most interesting career. Because of the interest, the spirit and brainpower will naturally return to it. If so, the reproductive desire impulse can be latent in the subconscious, without laboring the body or disturbing the mind.</p>
<p>Reproductive science is related to love, so this desire must be coordinated by both parties. However, the result of indulgence and self-pity often leads to kidney deficiency and premature aging, so it is advisable to increase essence and nourish the kidneys. If you can supplement it with the German testicular essence preparation for men "Butikang" at the right time, you can achieve the purpose of increasing essence and nourishing the kidneys. From my clinical experience, "Butikang" does have the effect of eradicating kidney deficiency and saving early aging. Elderly people take it, and it is guaranteed to have the effect of nourishing. Although there are similar tonics on the market, they are completely far from the ideal of our doctors, and many of them have very unqualified ingredients, which are completely beyond our expectations. Only "Butikang" is a medicine that is respected by Chinese and foreign doctors. For women, it has the effect of regulating menstruation, cultivating seeds, and treating anemia. All women with many wrinkles on their faces and breasts without curves can increase their health and beauty immediately after taking women's "Butikang." Its ingredients are completely extracted from the endocrine of female animal ovaries, and the ingredients are indeed reliable. Therefore, I dare to introduce it to patients.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Secret Tips for Choosing Medicine for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Mei Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Gonorrhea patients invariably feel lost and helpless when choosing medication. This is because a single mistreatment can lead to endless consequences. Acute cases can turn chronic, and chronic cases often develop complications such as orchitis and prostatitis, leading to sterility, impotence, and physical disability, which are truly terrifying. In the realm of gonorrhea treatment, after the failure of transmembrane sterilization therapy, general chemical therapies have often proven to be ineffective, failing to achieve the desired results. There have been no particularly valuable achievements for clinical use. Therefore, countless efforts have been dedicated to research. Fortunately, thanks to the discoveries of Lierke and He and Lin Naser, the autoimmune therapy for gonorrhea, which involves injecting protein into the human body to enhance the patient's anti-gonococcal toxins and produce a large number of blood cells to eradicate latent internal gonococci, has been recognized by doctors worldwide. Furthermore, Dr. Peter of Germany has taken this a step further with the latest scientific method, introducing protein pigment and creating the oral gonorrhea medication "Kelinnong." After multiple animal experiments, it has been proven to be a highly effective gonorrhea drug with no side effects.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea patients must pay special attention to treatment methods and be careful in choosing medication. It is essential to select medications that have no side effects and are highly effective, and that are used and praised by world-renowned doctors. "Kelinnong" has long been admired by European and American doctors, and numerous articles in major venereal disease journals recommend "Kelinnong." If "Kelinnong" were not exceptionally effective, how could it have achieved such recognition? Gonorrhea patients in Europe and America have adopted "Kelinnong" for self-treatment at home since its invention, achieving excellent results and gaining widespread confidence. This is a reliable shortcut for those choosing gonorrhea medication!</p>
<h3>The Latest Effective Lung Medicine</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Despite the inventions of medical experts in various countries for treating lung diseases, tuberculosis continues to increase in prevalence. This is largely because there are few truly effective drugs. While commonly used medications may provide temporary relief, they lack absolute efficacy, causing suffering for both doctors and patients. However, medications composed of iodine and calcareous substances have been found to improve the constitution and have therapeutic effects, possessing powerful bactericidal properties. "Bu Fei He Er" (Lung Supplement Box Er) is a medicine developed based on the aforementioned principles. This product is indeed effective for lung diseases. It has miraculous effects on hemoptysis, sputum, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, bloody and turbid sputum, loss of appetite, night sweats, pale complexion, and emaciation. It fills the body with calcareous substances, allowing lung cavities to heal. Therefore, it is effective for all stages of lung disease.</p>
<h3>Those with Nocturnal Emission Lack the Instinct to Marry</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>A patient named Qiu Ziliang from Haimen, Zhejiang, currently 25 years old (as he states), began studying at a certain middle school at the age of ten. Due to the enticement of classmates in the dormitory, he developed the bad habit of masturbation. At that age, he was ignorant and indulged in it daily, finding it quite interesting. A year later, he did not experience any symptoms except for occasional headaches. One day, he saw a headline in a magazine about how masturbation affects adolescent development. After reading it, he suddenly realized the truth. Although he resolved to quit, he was unable to break the habit. Two months later, he began experiencing nocturnal emissions and his body became extremely weak. Last year, he married at his parents' behest. Before the wedding, he took more than ten bottles of tonics. After the marriage, he could only last half a minute during intercourse. He would ejaculate almost immediately upon touching the female body. In addition, he suffered from insomnia, forgetfulness, back pain, and other symptoms. He has written to seek help from various doctors... (Treatment Process) Mr. Qiu's condition was caused by masturbation and nocturnal emissions. The treatment focused on both strengthening the seminal gate and nourishing the deficiencies. He was prescribed "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Pills" and "Bu Ti Kang" (Body Supplement Kang) and was instructed to strictly follow a regimen. Mr. Qiu followed the instructions diligently. After a month, his spirits were greatly improved, and the insomnia was gone. After another two months, his kidneys were strengthened, and his essence was sufficient. There were no more premature ejaculations, and he gained ten pounds in weight.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Symposium</p>
<h3>New Therapies for Persistent Gonococcal Infections</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan, Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Treating gonorrhea before it becomes chronic is the best course of action.</p>
<p>If it has become chronic, a comprehensive and effective treatment is essential.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a difficult venereal disease to treat because the causative agent, the gonococcus, possesses a very tenacious and combative nature and can hide in deep and inaccessible locations. Therefore, gonorrhea patients often suffer from persistent infections that are difficult to cure. Using a specific therapy is most effective during the acute stage of gonorrhea. However, this does not mean that once the acute phase has passed, the symptoms of persistent gonorrhea cannot be treated. The real challenge in treating gonorrhea is preventing the gonococci from invading in the first place, and if they have already penetrated, quickly eradicating them to prevent their reproduction and avoid a last-ditch struggle that drains the patient's energy.</p>
<p>The success or failure of gonorrhea treatment hinges on the method used, which is a matter of life and death. Generally speaking, this disease should first be treated with precise diagnosis to identify the root cause before prescribing medication to avoid unnecessary complications. Therefore, doctors should not rely on intuition when diagnosing gonorrhea but should still perform careful diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>However, the treatment of gonorrhea must be comprehensive to prevent the gonococci from escaping. German static electricity therapy has a great and complete effect in eradicating the nests of gonococci. Furthermore, supplementing with the oral gonorrhea medication "Kelinnong" provides both advantages and eliminates the difficulties because "Kelinnong" can travel through the bloodstream, capturing gonococci, while stimulating the whole body's blood and cells, causing them to produce an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. Therefore, stubborn and persistent gonorrhea can also be quickly cured.</p>

<h3>The Past Week</h3>
<p>The position of speculators is getting worse. Comparing the market conditions on the first and last days of this week: buying British currency loses at least 1.75 yuan per pound, and buying US dollars loses at least 0.6 yuan per dollar. If foreign currency rather than drafts are bought, each unit loses at least one to three yuan. In addition, buying spot goods loses at least 60 yuan per item; hoarding cotton yarn loses at least 52 yuan per bale of 20-count Double Horse brand; and each dan of Tongzhou cotton loses at least 45 yuan. The bullish camp has been completely defeated. However, buying government bonds makes money. For example, E bonds have risen by 0.7 yuan, and there is a difference of more than one yuan between the high and low peaks that can be earned. It is good to have both the patriotic name and the money! Looking back on the speculation sector since the outbreak of the war, only the bond market has been relatively stable. There are countless reasons, and the main one is that the bulls must do it to the end. Because of this, the domestic bond market has become the most appropriate and reliable investment place!</p>
<p>After the United Kingdom, France, and Turkey signed the "Mutual Assistance Agreement," the Soviet Union and Turkey exchanged congratulatory telegrams. Perhaps this is another new factor that allows the Soviet Union to get rid of European disputes. It was reported from The Hague that conflicts between Mongolia and "Manchukuo," Japan, and the Soviet Union have started again, although it has not been confirmed, but at least it can match the above speculation. Moreover, the speech by US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, the US Secretary of State Hull's righteous words on the Shanghai Concession and the promise to provide substantial assistance, have clarified the situation in the Far East. At the same time, the brave advancement of the Chinese army on various fronts, frequent victories, and the Japanese side's indiscriminate release of peace rhetoric, trying to make a cunning escape. All this has made the market people excited and firm! Therefore, it is speculated that this week's market will be even better! (Must give)</p>
<p>Since the first half of the 27th year of the Republic [1938], prices in Shanghai have gradually increased, and the recent price increases have been even worse, making life very difficult for the people.

<p>After the outbreak of the European war, trade between the belligerent countries and China was greatly affected, and imports decreased sharply. In September, the import volume of the Shanghai Customs was 48,816,916 yuan, and the export volume was 66,711,080 yuan, changing from an import surplus to an export surplus. This is a good sign for the entire national trade and a great help for the revitalization of the nation. In the future, we will try our best to reject consumable imported goods and strive to increase exports, and the future will be even more optimistic! (Wang Dafai)</p>

<h3>The Situation in Caojiadu is Tense: Thugs Attack Patrols Again, The Puppet Self-Defense Corps Resists with Guns, A Fierce Battle Ensues with Bullets Raining Down: Two Thugs Dead and Two Wounded, A Chinese Constable and a Passerby Also Killed</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 20th, after the concession patrol was attacked in the extraterritorial road construction area, the concession police authorities intensified their defenses there. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 22nd) morning, the same incident occurred again in Caojiadu in the area. The so-called "Self-Defense Corps" shot and killed one concession patrol and wounded one. Upon receiving the report, the police authorities immediately dispatched a large number of detectives and red armored vehicles to Cao Yi Elementary School at No. 1081 Jessfield Road, where the "Self-Defense Corps" was located, to encircle and suppress them. Unexpectedly, the thugs of the corps dared to attack the patrol first and throw hand grenades. The patrol, having no choice, retaliated with machine guns. The two sides held out for two hours, killing two thugs and injuring several others. Only then did their ferocity subside. Subsequently, Japanese military police arrived after hearing the news and transferred the "Self-Defense Corps" away from the area, replacing them with Japanese and Italian soldiers. The situation only eased by 8:00 AM yesterday. However, the concession authorities believe that the situation in western Shanghai has deteriorated further. In addition to continuing to strengthen the police force in the extraterritorial road construction area, they also continued to report the incident that occurred yesterday morning to the Consular Body. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Puppet Self-Defense Corps Active All Night Long</h3>
<p>Cao Yi Elementary School at No. 1081 Jessfield Road was occupied by armed thugs in August, and a "Self-Defense Corps" was established inside. They were disarmed by Italian troops once, and after being released, they still hid in the house, but they always closed the gate tightly and entered and exited through the back door, and there was no sound for a long time. Recently, as the situation in western Shanghai changed, the thugs became active again. The corps is equipped with a motorcycle, which is dedicated to driving the members. Every night when it is quiet, they drive the car and ram into the extraterritorial roads. This situation was detected by the concession police, who believed that the armed men were violating the curfew by operating on the Public Works Department's roads in the middle of the night, and advised them to stop. They were able to comply when they first heard the warnings, but in recent days, they have relapsed and often drive around Jessfield Road and Caojiadu at night. Yesterday morning's incident occurred when members of the "Self-Defense Corps" were driving around Jessfield Road.</p>
<h3>Shooting the Chinese Constable First</h3>
<p>Since the repeated incidents caused by the puppet police, the concession police force has increased its police force in the area to maintain police power in the area and strictly prevent thugs from disturbing public order. Yesterday morning, the Jing'an Temple police station dispatched the English Detective No. 92 of the Gordon Road police station's reserve team, along with Chinese Constable No. 2594, to patrol on a motorcycle. When passing through Caojiadu, they happened to see three armed members of the Self-Defense Corps driving around. Because they violated the curfew, they got out of the car and stepped forward to advise them. Unexpectedly, one of the armed members took advantage of the two constables' unpreparedness and fired a gun. At that time, the two constables were caught off guard. One of the Chinese constables was shot in the back, and the bullet came out through the abdomen. He immediately fell to the ground unconscious. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the thugs quickly drove back to their lair.</p>
<h3>A Large Group of Patrols Rushed to the Scene After Hearing the Alarm</h3>
<p>Seeing that the Chinese constable had been injured, the English detective also drove quickly back to the nearby guard booth and reported to the Jing'an Temple police station by telephone. After a while, an ambulance drove to the scene and took the injured Chinese constable to the Shanghai Pass Road Patrol Hospital for treatment. At the same time, more than 40 Chinese and Western patrols from the Jing'an Temple police station, riding in armored vehicles No. 5 and No. 6, and more than 70 Chinese and Western patrols from the Gordon Road police station, riding in red police cars No. 1627 and No. 16274, rushed to the scene to investigate. Unexpectedly, the "Self-Defense Corps" thugs, fearing nothing, were waiting with their guns near their lair. Several armed members climbed to the roof of the fourth floor of Cao Yi Elementary School and ambushed. At that time, a large number of patrols surrounded the location of the "Self-Defense Corps."</p>
<h3>Thugs Resist and a Fierce Battle Ensues</h3>
<p>When the "Self-Defense Corps" saw the detectives surrounding them, they not only did not show surrender but instead took the initiative to shoot. However, none of them hit. Two thugs of the "Self-Defense Corps" who were crawling on the roof even dared to throw hand grenades at the detectives. A total of five were thrown, but only two exploded, and they did not injure the detectives. Seeing the thugs firing guns and throwing grenades, the detectives fired back. The light machine guns on the police car also fired in rapid succession, carrying out intensive shooting at the thugs on the roof. For a time, the sound of gunfire was loud, and bullets rained down, like a magnificent battle for control. Soon, the two thugs who threw grenades on the roof were shot dead by the detectives with machine guns. The thugs downstairs were also showing signs of being unable to support themselves. The fierce battle gradually quieted down. From the time the thugs fired the first shot at 4:45 AM, the fierce battle lasted for 15 minutes.</p>
<h3>Thugs Killed and Wounded in the Battle</h3>
<p>In addition to the two thugs being killed, two others were injured and were sent by their companions to Luren Hospital on Van Huangdu Road for treatment. No concession detectives were killed or injured in the battle. However, Chinese Constable No. 2594, who had been injured by the thugs earlier, was sent to the patrol hospital for treatment, but eventually died at 8:20 AM due to serious injuries and excessive bleeding. Also, during the battle, an old steward in the tofu shop across from Cao Yi Elementary School was killed by a stray bullet.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Enter and Station, Thugs Retreat</h3>
<p>When the two sides were in a fierce battle, the Shanghai West Japanese Military Police Headquarters at the intersection of Jessfield Road and Kennard Road heard the news and immediately dispatched a large number of military police, about 30 to 40 people, supervised by a large number of puppet police, carrying full arms, and riding in military trucks, rushing to Cao Yi Elementary School. At that time, the thugs had retreated due to being unable to support themselves, and the fierce battle had subsided. After the Japanese military police arrived, because the concession police were still waiting in battle formation at the gate of Cao Yi Elementary School, they ordered the puppet police to get out of the car first and quickly form a confrontational position with the concession detectives. Then, the Japanese military police got out of the car and went directly to Cao Yi Elementary School, escorted eleven armed thugs of the "Self-Defense Corps" out of the door, took them into the truck, and drove to the Japanese military police headquarters. Cao Yi Elementary School was then guarded by a total of seventy or eighty Japanese military police and puppet police.</p>
<h3>Order Restored, Precautions Strengthened</h3>
<p>Seeing that the armed detectives were escorted away by the Japanese military police, the concession detectives believed that this matter could be considered over, so they also withdrew. The time was already 8:00 AM, and the Caojiadu area began to restore order. However, in order to guard the area, the concession side sent out three armored vehicles No. 2, No. 4, and No. 9 at about 9:00 AM, and the situation at the Caojiadu Wujiaochang intersection was very strict. The Japanese and puppet sides closed the gate of Cao Yi Elementary School tightly, and two Japanese military police guarded it outside. As the area was originally an Italian military defense zone, the Italian military camp on Jiaozhou Road also sent more than 30 soldiers in two trucks to the Wujiaochang intersection to assist in guarding after the incident occurred.</p>
<h3>Two Teams of Italian Soldiers on Patrol</h3>
<p>The Da Zhong News Agency reporter went to Caojiadu for inspection yesterday afternoon and saw three Japanese military police and two puppet police stationed at the gate of Cao Yi Elementary School. Three armored vehicles were parked in Wujiaochang in a triangle formation, one in front of Longtai Liquor Store, one in front of Dinghexiang Smoke Store, and the other in front of Wanshunchang South Goods Store. Each vehicle had six Chinese and Western detectives guarding it. Two teams of Italian soldiers, each with fifteen soldiers, patrolled back and forth in the Wujiaochang area. There were very few traces of puppet police in Caojiadu in the morning. It was not until about 2:00 PM that a large number of puppet police appeared and set up posts near Wujiaochang, totaling more than 20 people. The rest lined up and patrolled back and forth.</p>
<p>When the incident happened, because it was dawn, most of the residents were awakened in their dreams and were extremely frightened. Therefore, the shops there did not start their business until about 8:00 AM. As for the old steward of the tofu shop who was killed, he was killed because he was curious to go out to see.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Decided to Report to the Consular Body</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the "Self-Defense Corps" attacked the concession patrol twice and threw as many as five hand grenades. One Chinese constable was shot and killed. The authorities of Shanghai's various countries were greatly stimulated and agitated. It is heard that the Public Concession Police Department has prepared a detailed report and will submit it to the Public Works Department so that the Department can submit the report to the Consular Body. According to a report in the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, when the two sides were fighting fiercely at Cao Yi Elementary School, the Italian soldiers stationed there joined the police side and fired many guns at the thugs.</p>
<h3>Wuxi and Changzhou Railway Stations Are in the Hands of the Chinese Army, Areas Five Li Outside the City Walls Are Under Chinese Military Control, Plainclothes Teams Act Erratically Inside the City</h3>
<p>It is confirmed that the three divisions of the Chinese regular army are now concentrated in the mountains between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and are advancing towards Nanjing and Yixing. All of a certain division has passed through Zhangzhu Town in Yixing County and is fiercely attacking Yixing County. They encountered Japanese troops on the outskirts of Yixing and annihilated them. Therefore, the battle was extremely fierce, approaching the city of Yixing directly. The plainclothes team even once stormed into the city, so Yixing is now in a state of war again. The guerrilla warfare in Changzhou and Wuxi counties is carried out by the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Guerrilla Army of Deng Benyin, the former garrison commander of Qiongyai, and another part is a certain column of the New Army. All areas five li away from Changzhou and Wuxi are under the control of the Chinese army, and there are also traces of active troops on the Jinghu Road. The Wuxi and Changzhou railway stations are actually in the hands of the Chinese army, so passenger trains are not in danger, but all trains carrying Japanese soldiers are destroyed. Since the bomb in the theater inside the west gate of Changzhou killed four Japanese soldiers, two Japanese soldiers walking on the road were shot and killed by the plainclothes team on West Gate Street two days later. While the Japanese army was searching frantically behind closed doors, a bomb exploded at Beitang Bridge, and the Japanese army was as frightened as frightened birds and extremely terrified. At the same time, the guerrilla team in Bei Dou Xia He Tang in Wuxi attacked the Japanese army in the motorboat, killing two of them. An anti-Japanese bulletin was found in front of the park in the city.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Road Tongbazi Road Passage Yesterday Blocked by Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The passage on the east side of the barbed wire set up by the Japanese army on North Jiangxi Road could originally lead directly to Bazai Road and into Fusheng Road. When the reporter went to inspect the area at 3:00 PM yesterday, he saw that the right side of the Jiangsu Motor Company at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazi Road had been blocked by barbed wire. Pedestrians entering and exiting had to detour through Haining Road and North Sichuan Road and then turn into Bazi Road. An armed Japanese soldier was patrolling back and forth on the east side of the barbed wire. There were originally only two Japanese soldiers stationed at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road. When the reporter went to the area at 3:00 PM yesterday, he saw a Chinese man in a coffee-colored robe standing next to the Japanese soldier on guard, helping the Japanese soldiers check pedestrians. After the Japanese army took over the defenses of the northern part of Suzhou River, they forced the residents in the area to get vaccinated, but because most of the residents in the area were unwilling to get vaccinated, the vaccination point at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road was closed and changed to the Puppet City Chamber of Commerce for vaccination, and a fee of 2 jiao was required. However, the number of people who went to get vaccinated was still small. Yesterday afternoon, a notice was posted on the door of the Puppet City Chamber of Commerce, notifying residents that the vaccination period would be extended to the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Suggesting the Concession Authorities Equip Grain Storage, Purchase During Inland Harvests, Be Prepared in Case of Shortages</h3>
<p>The 15th, 36th, and 37th District branches of the First Special District Citizens' Association jointly sent a letter to the General Association yesterday, stating that the prices of everything in Shanghai are expensive, and people's livelihoods are in distress. Taking food rice as an example, since the price limit has been exceeded, the price has risen again and again, which has the most profound impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people. Recently, with the new grains in each rice-producing area entering the market, the rice prices in Shanghai have seen a slight recovery due to the gradual increase in arrivals. However, the price of middle and upper white rice has not fallen close to the price limit, and the difficulties of people's livelihoods have not been completely eliminated. We believe that food is the most important thing for people, and it is very important for social order and public security. The environment in Shanghai is special, and after the war, it has become a haven for refugees. In such a small place, it is said to have 5 million people. With such a large population, if we want to ensure that people have no worries about food, we should have expedient and adaptable methods. The branches are eyewitnesses to the hardships of the people and hereby jointly suggest that the two concession authorities take advantage of this inland harvest and the entry of domestic rice into the market to find ways to purchase a large amount from the inland, transport it to Shanghai, set up public warehouses in the concession, and implement storage. In this way, in case of lack of supply, we will be prepared. This matter concerns the people's food and public order. We earnestly request that you forward this letter to the two concession authorities for adoption and implementation, and we will be eternally grateful.</p>
<h3>US Consul General Gauss Visits Japanese Consul Miura, Frequent Activities in Shanghai Diplomatic Circles, The Consular Body Discusses the General Situation</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that yesterday (the 21st), diplomatic activities in Shanghai were frequent. The US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, visited the Japanese Consul General, Miura, yesterday afternoon. Last night, Gauss was unwilling to publish any news about his talks, but it was heard from the Japanese side that the focus of the conversation was the incident on Friday night in which Chinese and Indian constables were killed and injured in the shooting. It was also heard yesterday that the British Consul General, Phillips, and other consuls in the Consular Body discussed this unfortunate incident and the general situation.</p>
<h3>Phillips Said Protesting Too Early</h3>
<p>The Director General of the Public Works Department, Phillips, mentioned the case yesterday and told reporters that it was too early to file a protest even if it was intended. Generally, people firmly believe that the plainclothes people related to the "Special Municipal Government" carried out the attack, causing the death and injury of one Chinese and one Indian constable. At present, it is purely speculation.</p>
<h3>All Parties Believe It Was the Henchman of the Puppet Government</h3>
<p>At the same time, the Public Concession officials expressed their firm opinions yesterday. They believed that it was indeed the henchman of the "Special Municipal Government" who carried out the shooting. Although what has been obtained so far is purely indirect evidence for reference, this evidence is very powerful and cannot be ignored. Detectives of the Police Department collected eyewitness reports yesterday and traced various clues related to the shooting. They said that they may soon obtain more conclusive evidence to prove the true identity of the thugs.</p>
<h3>Determination to Protect American Nationals</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the shooting in the western district on Friday night has caused the Director General of the Public Works Department, Fackling, to announce</p>
<h3>Replacement Money for Winter Clothing Nearing Full Amount; Central Collection Agency Will Produce Winter Clothing to Distribute to Soldiers</h3>
<p>Since the National Winter Clothing Collection Association promoted the collection of three million cotton vests to be distributed to soldiers, and the collection of old clothes to be distributed to refugees, all provinces, cities, counties, and overseas Chinese compatriots have been uniformly promoting this initiative. All sectors in Shanghai cherish and support the soldiers fighting the war. However, due to the unique environment, sewing, transporting, and shipping winter clothes is quite inconvenient. Therefore, it was specially changed to collecting 200,000 yuan in replacement money for winter clothing. Since the promotion began, a large number of people from the labor, business, education, and women's circles have generously donated, and their enthusiasm is extremely high. It is heard that the full amount will soon be reached. Various collecting national banks and newspapers will remit this replacement money for winter clothing directly to the National Winter Clothing Collection Association by the end of this month to produce winter clothing and distribute it to soldiers. Regarding the determination to protect the lives of American residents in the western district, according to Mr. Hao Xiong, the newly appointed Japanese director of the Public Works Department, he stated that he knew nothing about this case and expressed regret. He deeply sympathized with the Chinese police officers who died in the line of duty. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 22nd, there has been no confirmation here of the rumors that Secretary of State Hull claimed that the United States would assist the Shanghai Municipal Council in resolving the issue of road construction beyond the concession boundaries.</p>
<h3>Yuan Ying's Safety; The Association Is Trying to Rescue Him</h3>
<p>Venerable Master Yuan Ying, the Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, has been detained for five days since he was taken away some time ago. All parties are extremely concerned about him. However, considering Yuan Ying's usual behavior, it is not enough to provoke the jealousy of the Japanese, so it is believed that his life may not be in danger. According to news from Buddhist circles, although the location where the Master is being detained is unclear, it has been ascertained that the Master was detained and interrogated because he was suspected of being implicated in a certain matter. He is still very safe. Therefore, colleagues of the Buddhist Association are trying to rescue him in the hope of securing his early release.</p>
<h3>Another Harsh Policy by the Japanese Puppet Regime in Hongkou; Levying Donations from Street Vendors Under the Pretext of Rectifying the City Appearance</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese military police in Hongkou, under the pretext of rectifying the city appearance, issued a notice stipulating that stalls are not allowed to be set up in the areas of Hongkou including Wusong Road, Haining Road, Zhabei Road, Bazhi Road, Feihong Road, Broadway Road, North Sichuan Road, and North Suzhou Road. However, those who pay donations and obtain licenses are exempt from this rule, causing general small-business peddlers to feel quite panicked upon hearing the news. They all worry about the disruption of their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Haiphong Chamber of Commerce Cables Shanghai Urging Speedy Visa Processing for Existing Inventory; Requests for Extension May Be Rejected; Hoping to Clear Inventory Soon</h3>
<p>Wu Bomin, specially dispatched by the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce to Shanghai, is contacting to sign and release German, Austrian, and Czech goods remaining in Haiphong. Yesterday, the Haiphong Chamber of Commerce cabled, instructing Shanghai importers to quickly bring the documentary proof for purchasing the aforementioned goods to the French Consulate General in Shanghai to complete the signing procedures and send them to Haiphong for delivery, because the time is tight, and any delay may result in confiscation. Since the Standing Committee limits the deadline to the end of this month, it is not yet known whether it can be extended. Therefore, it is best to expedite the process so as not to exceed the deadline. The special envoys Mr. Wu and Mr. Chen from the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, except for Mr. Chen who returned to Haiphong yesterday, Mr. Wu is also scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 24th. Relevant Shanghai merchants can still directly hand over documents to Mr. He Hongzhan of the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road or the China Travel Service on Jiangxi Road and the Zhongnan Express Company on Jiujiang Road before the 24th. The Haiphong Austrian and Czech Goods Visa Office will collect them on their behalf and hand them over to Mr. Wu, who will compile and bring them to Haiphong, which is faster.</p>
<h3>British Military Attache, Speer, Eloquently Narrates His Arrest Experience; Suffering Greatly Traveling North from Chongqing via Yan'an; Arrested and Imprisoned by the Japanese Army for Fifteen Weeks; Speer Will Go to the United States Next Week and Return to England</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin News reports that Lieutenant Colonel Speer, the British Army Attaché to China, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (21st) aboard the Shengjing. He will stay here for a week and depart next Sunday aboard the President Cleveland, taking the route through the United States back to England. Although Colonel Speer was recently imprisoned by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou and suffered misfortune for fifteen weeks, he looks quite healthy. Yesterday, when he had an informal chat with local reporters, he leaned back in an easy chair, pipe in mouth, and eloquently narrated his journey from Chongqing to Zhangjiakou, which ended with his arrest by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Brief Summary of the Journey</p>
<p>Colonel Speer first departed from Chongqing by plane to Xi'an. After arriving in Xi'an, he stayed for a few days and took a car to Yan'an, where he lingered for two weeks. He continued his journey from Yan'an by car to Mizhi. After arriving in Mizhi, the difficulty of his journey began. From here, for thousands of miles, he traveled through rugged and mountainous countryside. Colonel Speer then gathered mules and horses in Mizhi, and, except for his guards, set off alone to Beijing via the wilderness. In these thousands of miles, he walked seven hundred miles because most of the road was impassable by riding. However, he experienced no difficulty traversing this rugged terrain, considering it merely like a weekend hike.</p>
<p>Life in Confinement</p>
<p>After traveling for seven weeks, he was arrested by the Japanese army in a small church in Xuanshuizi (transliteration), outside Zhangjiakou. Colonel Speer was imprisoned by the Japanese army for a total of fifteen weeks, of which he spent thirteen weeks in the silence of solitary confinement. The Japanese army allowed Colonel Speer the right to exercise, but he had to be escorted by an armed Japanese soldier guard. This procedure was completely contrary to the regulations for the movement of British military officers in British-controlled territory. Colonel Speer therefore refused to leave the room for exercise. Colonel Speer fell ill three times while imprisoned in Zhangjiakou and was treated by a Japanese military doctor.</p>
<p>Japanese Interrogation</p>
<p>What he found most annoying was that Japanese officers would relentlessly interrogate him from 10 PM to 3 AM the next morning. A reporter asked Colonel Speer if he knew that the Japanese side intended to open a military tribunal for interrogation, but it was not realized. Colonel Speer replied that he had never heard of the interrogation until he had the opportunity to read the newspaper after being released. Someone asked if he knew that Major Biggot, the British military attaché to Japan, had negotiated with the Japanese authorities in Zhangjiakou. Colonel Speer said that he was not in a position to discuss this particular incident. He knew when he left Zhangjiakou for Beijing on September 6 that he would be released within a few days.</p>
<p>Heading to the United States Next Week</p>
<p>After Colonel Speer set off and arrived at Xuanshuizi Church, Lieutenant Cooper of the British Embassy in Beijing was already waiting at the church. On May 9, both men were arrested by ten Japanese soldiers in the church. Lieutenant Cooper was released after two weeks of imprisonment, but Colonel Speer did not regain his freedom until September 8. It is reported that Colonel Speer is scheduled to take a ship to San Francisco next Sunday and plans to tour the United States for two weeks. He has already prepared a letter of introduction to Ms. Anna May Wong and will travel to Hollywood. Then he will leave the United States and return to England. He is taking sick leave to return home this time, but it is not known whether he will return to China to serve in the British Embassy or be ordered to go to France to participate in the war.</p>
<p>Meeting with Mao Zedong</p>
<p>Also, the Mainland News reports that Colonel Speer told reporters that he was imprisoned in Zhangjiakou for nearly four months. Although he lost forty pounds in weight, he was not physically affected. The Japanese treatment was normal during his imprisonment, and the Japanese military doctors' treatment ability was below standard. He departed from Chongqing in March and had no secrets about this trip because he asked people in the church to spread the news of his arrival, which ultimately led the Japanese army to decide to arrest him. He traveled for two months in the provinces of Shanxi and Hebei, which are presumably occupied by the Japanese army, but never saw Japanese soldiers or Japanese flags. Colonel Speer also said that he met with Communist leader Mao Zedong in Yan'an. Mao is "a person of integrity" and the communist people in that part of the world are extremely healthy and the most promising people. When he arrived in the suburbs of Zhangjiakou, he was arrested by the Japanese army. According to international law, the Japanese army should hand him over to the British authorities for handling.</p>

<h3>Comedy Turns into Tragedy; Blood Splatters in the Auditorium; Four People Including Female Bridesmaids Die Tragically; Seven People Injured by Stray Bullets; Rumors Say the Groom is a New Rising Star</h3>
<p>In the hall on the second floor of the Zhongshe building at 674 Weihaiwei Road in the Public Concession, around 4:30 PM yesterday, when the Du and Chen families were holding a wedding ceremony, six or seven thugs suddenly infiltrated among the guests and opened fire. Bullets flew like a string of pearls, with about a dozen shots fired. Eleven people were killed or injured on the spot. The bride and groom were spared. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Happy Union Turns into a Tragedy</p>
<p>The groom, Du Chengzhong, is from Nanxun, nearly thirty years old, and resides at 92 Yugucun, Yu Garden Road in West Shanghai. He only moved there about two months ago. It is said that Du used to work for the Xinbao newspaper and is now rumored to be a new rising star. The bride's name is Chen Shoukun, twenty-six years old. She graduated from a certain girls' high school and was excellent in both character and academics. She was deeply favored by teachers and loved by classmates during her school days. The new couple fell in love out of friendship and, after a long time, finally became happily married. They deeply wished to grow old together and form a happy marriage. Unexpectedly, six or seven thugs suddenly came, pulled out their pistols, and fired over a dozen shots, the sound shaking the outside world.</p>
<p>Corpses Scattered, Too Tragic to Bear</p>
<p>At that time, the wedding ceremony was being held in the hall. The wedding officiant, Zhu Hegao, was giving a speech, and the guests were craning their necks, full of excitement. Suddenly, gunshots were heard, and those hit by the bullets fell to the ground in response. Corpses were scattered everywhere. Instantly, the order of the hall was disrupted, and the sound of cries for help was heartbreaking. Blood splattered on the floor, like a spring gushing out. Taking advantage of the chaos, the thugs calmly fled with their guns. Some male and female guests fell down the stairs while trying to escape for their lives.</p>
<p>Two Female Bridesmaids Perish Tragically</p>
<p>After the incident, the Zhongshe authorities urgently reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and summoned ambulances to rush to the scene, sending all the dead and injured, both men and women, to various hospitals. Here is a list of the names: Yan Yunyu, a girl from Huzhou, twenty-one years old, was a female bridesmaid. She was shot in the left breast, the bullet piercing through her back (residing at 754 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road). She was a classmate of the bride and also a cousin. Another bridesmaid, whose name was Liu Jiqing, twenty-seven years old, was shot in the head, chest, back, and other places, a total of four or five shots, injuring vital parts. Both died at the same time.</p>
<p>Two Guests Also Killed Tragically</p>
<p>Another guest, Liu Bainian, a Western doctor, twenty-five years old, from Huzhou, resided at Jiren Hospital, Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. He was shot in the chest and head and died on the spot. It is said that Liu was planning to take a mail ship to Hong Kong this morning to work in Kunming. The ship ticket and other matters were ready. Now, he has suffered this unexpected disaster, and his relatives and friends deeply mourn him. Li Yupu, nearly forty years old, was shot in the back, and his breath was faint. He died in the hospital less than an hour after arriving.</p>
<p>Many Men, Women, Old and Young Injured</p>
<p>Among the female guests was Wei Zhang, forty years old. She was holding a boy in her arms, named Yu Gui, only two years old, watching the ceremony from the side. She was also hit by a stray bullet, shooting her left arm and grazing Yu Gui's face, causing fresh blood to flow. The boy, Ling Qibao, fifteen years old, Cantonese, residing at 39 Fuxu Road, was shot in the left leg. Shen Chen, forty-six years old, a local, was shot in the back of the hand and leg. Ding Xiaogen, fifty-six years old, from Changshu, was injured in the thigh. Xu Du, thirty-four years old, a local, was shot in the back. Zhang Yu, from Kunshan, thirty years old, was shot in the head, the situation is very serious, and her life is in danger. The injured were sent to Shiji Baolong and other hospitals for treatment.</p>
<p>Bullet Holes Everywhere, Order in Chaos</p>
<p>When the reporter rushed to investigate the scene after the incident, he caught sight of bullet holes on the walls of the hall on the second floor of Zhongshe, shattered glass windows, and disordered tables and chairs. According to the Zhongshe bookkeeper, there was only one wedding event today, jointly organized by the two families, for a scheduled banquet of sixteen tables. Who knew that after the incident, the male and female guests were scattered in shock, and the new couple was taken to the police station by detectives to await interrogation. The tea and dishes were still left in the kitchen, and the banquet had not yet begun. This unexpected incident has caused considerable losses to Zhongshe.</p>
<p>The Labor Dispute in Women's Clothing and Western-Style Clothing Industry Resolved</p>
<p>The labor dispute in the women's clothing and Western-style clothing industry on Simalu has been fully restored yesterday. At 7:00 AM yesterday, both parties held another mediation meeting at the Fengjili meeting place on Guizhou Road. The employers agreed to increase wages by 45%, that is, the wage for each coat increased from 2.30 yuan to 3.30 yuan. The workers also considered it satisfactory. On the same day, they notified all workers to resume work. Both parties also agreed to sign the resumption of work conditions at 2:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Retired Detective and Wife Shot and Seriously Injured by Robbers; Robbers Break In and Struggle with Robbers, Resulting in Serious Injuries; Two Robbers Flee</h3>
<p>Shao Hejun, a man from Suzhou, fifty-seven years old, lived at No. 6, Lane 924, Haining Road, north of Suzhou River. He had been a detective in the concession in his early years and has been retired for many years. His wife, Ms. Wu, forty-five years old, from the same place as Shao, had just finished dinner with her husband around 7:00 PM yesterday and was washing in the room when two robbers suddenly entered the room to rob. Shao and his wife were caught off guard and were controlled by the robbers with guns, unable to move. They were forced to hand over the key to the silver box. After the robbers got the key, they planned to open the box. Seeing an opportunity, Shao and his wife quickly ran to the outer room. The robbers, seeing this, also abandoned the box and chased out, ordering them to return to the room. At this time, Shao and his wife saw the robbers panicking and took advantage of the situation to fight with the robbers. In desperation, the robbers opened fire, causing both Shao and his wife to be knocked down. The two robbers did not rob and fled through the door. When the neighbors and others arrived after hearing the arrest, it was impossible to arrest them. Looking back at Shao and his wife, they were lying in a pool of blood, barely breathing. Shao Hejun was shot twice in the chest, and Shao Wu was shot once in the chest. The Huisi Police Station was notified, and detectives were dispatched to investigate the scene. The injured were rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injuries are serious and life-threatening.</p>
<h3>An Interview with World Economic Expert, Professor Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>Professor Oppenheimer, a famous economist and sociologist, not tolerated by Nazi Germany, and persecuted by Japan, fleeing to Shanghai with only one relative - his daughter - is a picture of how indignant and how sympathetic. Especially to a student who once took his class. With such emotions, the reporter hastily paid a visit to the professor.</p>
<p>After hearing my identity and intentions on the phone, Professor Oppenheimer happily agreed to meet.</p>
<p>"Professor, it's been many years."</p>
<p>"No, I was thrown out of the university eight years ago." Professor Ou corrected me, seemingly indifferent to his expulsion from the university. We counted the years, briefly described the situation back then, and Professor Ou frankly raised his heartfelt question!</p>
<p>"I'm old, and I can't stand the climate here. The matter at the University of California is certainly not a problem, but it's very troublesome for my daughter to go because she doesn't have a Jewish passport. I'm thinking of going to Manila to teach. Do you know anyone?"</p>
<p>As soon as he finished speaking, Miss Oppenheimer came in. Professor Ou briefly introduced her and repeated what he had just said. Miss Ou said very innocently:</p>
<p>"Yes, my father can't leave me, and I only have a German passport. Wherever I go, people will ask many questions, investigate, consider, and suspect that I am a spy."</p>
<p>I promised to inquire and see if anyone has connections with Manila. We then talked about some other issues. Professor Ou spread his book "Capital" in front of me, pointed out a passage by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and said:</p>
<p>"Sun Yat-sen's theory of equal land rights is similar to my theory."</p>
<p>He seemed quite proud when he said this. He asked if I was a follower of Mr. Sun. His daughter rushed to say:</p>
<p>"No Chinese person doesn't believe in Dr. Sun Yat-sen and General Chiang Kai-shek, unless they believe in Japan."</p>
<p>When asked about his impressions of the Sino-Japanese War, Professor Ou said, "I'm not a strategist, I don't understand military affairs, but from an economic point of view, Japan is spending millions of yen on war expenses and sending millions of troops to China. The entire national economy is greatly affected. Now there is a lack of raw materials and prices are soaring. With such a small and exhausted Japan, it is impossible to swallow the enormous China."</p>
<p>"Then, if we explain the current cause of the war from an economic point of view, what will it be?"</p>
<p>"Well, you've read my 'Theoretical Economics.' In the last two chapters of that book, it says that capitalism must rely on foreign markets, but the more capitalism develops, the smaller the foreign markets become. For example, initially there was only British capitalism, and later the capitalism of other countries, such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States... also developed, and China also began to be capitalist. The empty space is getting smaller and smaller. The state is originally the organization that maintains the national economy. To compete for the market, this is how wars happen."</p>
<p>To avoid the difficulties of his refugee life, Professor Ou was reluctant to talk too much. Most of the time, with Miss Ou's participation, they talked about some life issues. Miss Ou is very smart. In addition to Japanese and Japanese, she also recognizes more than 3,000 Chinese characters, but she can't pronounce them. She is now asking someone to teach her Mandarin and Shanghai dialect. Professor Ou himself is now organizing his great work "Sociology," preparing for a new edition with additions. He strongly disapproves of the British classical school in economics. When he energetically criticized Adam Smith and Ricardo, Miss Ou joked, "My father doesn't like university professors."</p>
<p>When shaking hands to say goodbye, Professor Ou was still insistent about the Manila matter. He said, "My pension has been canceled. I have been staying abroad for nine months since leaving Germany last December. Although I have some savings, it is difficult to sustain them. I have to teach some courses in a suitable place."</p>
<p>"Professor, I wish you well. People all over the world, especially the Chinese people, are fighting for world culture. The world welcomes truly knowledgeable scholars. Your wishes will always be achieved."</p>
<h3>Assaulting Elder Sister Case; Zhu Li Has Not Yet Escaped Danger</h3>
<p>Li Miaoquan, a native of Tongzhou residing at No. 4, Lane 349, North Henan Road, around 6:00 PM on the 8th of this month, his elder sister, Zhu Li, went to his place to demand the repayment of 50 yuan in legal tender, which was unsuccessful, and a disagreement occurred. Li Miaoquan and his wife, Wang, and their fellow villager, Chen Lianqi, instigated the situation and then resorted to violence. Li Miaoquan pushed his sister, Zhu Li, to the ground and beat her fiercely, using his feet to</p>
<p>Kick Her Abdomen Violently</p>
<p>She was pregnant and cried out in pain. Neighbors reported to the patrolling police, and the group fled outside. Zhu Li was sent to the Xizang Road Refugee Hospital for treatment. By 8:00 PM on the 12th, the six-month-old fetus in her abdomen had not moved at all, and she felt extreme pain. After a doctor's examination, it was feared that the fetus had no hope of survival, and</p>
<p>Her Life Was in Great Danger</p>
<p>She hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to report the situation to the Huai Police Station and request the arrest of Li Miaoquan for investigation. The head of the police dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Li and escort him to the First Special District Court. The police prosecuted him for serious injury, and he was ordered to be remanded in custody, pending a further review after the injured party, Zhu Li, recovered. The police also</p>
<p>Arrested Li's Wife, Wang</p>
<p>and accomplice Chen Lianqi and sent them to the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan claimed that, according to the doctor's examination, the fetus in the abdomen of the victim, Zhu Li, had not yet died, and her lungs were injured, and she was coughing up blood in the hospital, and her life was in danger. Therefore, this case is requested to be postponed again to observe Zhu Li's condition,</p>
<p>Whether There Are Any Changes</p>
<p>etc. Lawyer Ma Junshuo also attended the hearing. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the three defendants, Li Miaoquan and his wife, and their statements were evasive. They were still ordered to be remanded in custody for further review.</p>
<h3>Issuance of Fractional Currency Has Achieved Results; Second Batch to Be Issued Soon; Fear May Be Eliminated Soon</h3>
<p>Regarding the issuance of fractional currency, according to a Mr. from the Central Bank of China, after the first batch of 500,000 yuan was issued, the fractional currency in the market has gradually circulated. The second batch can be issued before the end of this month. According to the bank's investigation, the fractional currency flowing into the occupied areas is not as much as rumored. After the cigarette exchange industry in the city was advised by the bank, it has been fully exchanged at face value without any discounts. It is now heard that the tram company, which uses the most, reports that more than one-third of those using the tram use fractional currency. Ticket sellers can also get a large number of fractional currency when settling accounts every night. Therefore, in addition to taking back the broken substitute currency, the company has issued less than half of the daily substitute currency. This proves that fractional currency has achieved considerable results. However, the amount of 500,000 yuan is indeed not enough for the current circulation, so the Central Bank of China is actively trying to print the second batch, which is expected to be issued continuously within the month. It is thought that the lack of fractional currency in the city will not be as fearful as in the past.</p>
<h3>Wooden Boat from Wenzhou Met With Disaster on the Open Sea; Japanese Claimed It Was Smuggling; No One and No Goods Were Spared</h3>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry, recently, many wood merchants from Wenzhou loaded three boats of wood, worth more than 200,000 yuan, to sell in Shanghai. However, on the 9th of this month, when the boat arrived at the sea ten nautical miles away from Wenzhou, it was suddenly attacked by a Japanese armed motorboat, which claimed it was smuggling military materials, and used machine guns to sweep the boat. Two boats were sunk, and more than 20 crew members were buried in the belly of the fish. The crew of the remaining boat saw that the situation was not good, and once tried to escape, but because of the slow speed, it was intercepted by the Japanese boat, which angered them and set fire to the boat and cargo. The crew also suffered, and no one was spared.</p>
<h3>French Concession's Electrical Installation Fees; Half of the Increased Price Approved; 20% of the Electrical Material Fee Collected; There Are Separate Regulations for Dismantling and Connecting Fires</h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Tram and Lighting Company, because the prices of electrical materials used for installing, repairing, and maintaining electrical lines have soared after the outbreak of the European War, has formulated a new price list. Although it has been approved by the Public Works Bureau, all electrical installation labor costs, except for exceptional expenses, are generally calculated at 20% of the material price. As for exceptional expenses, they should be calculated separately on the day the work is completed. Other fees, such as the installation or replacement of electric meters, dismantling and connecting fires, are 2.80 yuan each time. The inspection fee for reporting to the company from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM is 1.40 yuan each time, and for reporting to the company from 6:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning, it is 2.80 yuan each time. This fee is only valid when there is substantial work. If the work involves the user's line, the company will only charge the user the highest value of the following two items: (1) or the prescribed price of the work, (2) or the total amount of labor costs set in the quotation.</p>
<h3>Refusal to Authorize Demolition of Houses at Yuan Yi Fang, Xiaoshadu Road; Construction Company, on Behalf of the Owner, Sues for Eviction; Businesses Unanimously Oppose, Ordering Investigation and Reconsideration</h3>
<p>The city houses at numbers 1400 to 1438 along the road in Yuan Yi Fang, Xiaoshadu Road, have been rented for years by Yuan Zhaofa, Yang Deming, Dong Dezhong, Yang Ziyu, Lu Yongyi, Zhu Huizhang, Wu Yutang, Qian Daochang, Bao Xizhu, Hu Gengquan, etc., from the owner, Yuan Yi Company, and used to operate hotels, iron shops, flower factories, and other businesses. Unexpectedly, during the summer of this year, Huayang Dyeing and Weaving Factory at number 525 Cishu Building, Nanjing Road, purchased the</p>
<p>Yuan Yi Fang Houses</p>
<p>and entrusted Huaxin Architects Office, located in the same office building, to notify the Yuan Yi Fang tenants to move out for the purpose of demolishing and rebuilding the houses. Consequently, the tenants, collectively finding it difficult to find new premises during this extraordinary period, jointly appointed lawyer Tao Ran to file a petition with the First Special Court, requesting a ban on the demolition and rebuilding. It is now learned that after review by Judge Xu Fuji, the court ruled that the houses in Yuan Yi Fang, Xiaobodu Road, cannot be demolished and rebuilt before the termination of the leases is determined. Tenants Hu Gengquan, Bao Xizhu, Zhu Huizhang, Yuan Zhaofa, Wang Jiqing, Xie Keshan, etc., after receiving the</p>
<p>Court Ruling</p>
<p>originally intended to continue their businesses in peace. However, Huaxin Architects Office recently appointed a lawyer to file a petition with the Civil Court of the First Special Court, suing for an order to compel the tenants to move out. Tenants Hu Gengquan, Bao Xizhu, etc., appointed lawyer Tao Ran to file a defense, opposing the eviction, on the grounds that there are still questions about whether the plaintiff, Huaxin Architects Office, is the owner of Yuan Yi Fang, because when the plaintiff sent a letter notifying them to move out, it claimed to be undertaking the design and drafting of plans for rebuilding the factory buildings, without stating that it was the owner. Furthermore, the Yuan Yi Fang houses are in good condition and do not need to be rebuilt. The defendants</p>
<p>all operate businesses</p>
<p>making relocation even more difficult. Even if the plaintiff is the owner of Yuan Yi Fang, according to Article 425 of the Civil Code, the lease agreements between the tenants and the previous owner remain valid. The plaintiff claims that rebuilding will yield substantial profits, but it should be aware that Article 148 of the Civil Code stipulates that those exercising their rights must not engage in acts that harm others for their own benefit. The plaintiff's claim that the defendants are not direct tenants is even more inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, they request that the plaintiff Yuan Yi's lawsuit be rejected, etc. The case was heard by Judge Guo, who summoned both parties for questioning, but because further investigation is needed, he announced that the hearing would be rescheduled for November 9.</p>
<h3>Male Corpse Found in Toilet; Suffocated by Strangulation</h3>
<p>In the toilet on the mezzanine of the staircase on the second floor of a company house at 1920 Avenue Joffre, French Concession, at around 10 PM on the 21st, a servant entering the toilet discovered an unidentified man strangled to death, lying on the floor, and was terrified. He reported this to the Western manager, who reported it to the French police. Detectives were dispatched to investigate. The man was about 35 years old, wearing a white undershirt, a white cotton shirt with a blue checkered pattern, and a blue cloth short coat, all buttoned down the front, a gray camel-hair robe, covered with a gray cloth long coat, and black cloth and blue cloth trousers, one of each. He wore coffee-colored thread socks and real Zhigong cloth shoes. A hemp rope and a white cloth trouser belt were wrapped around his neck. He had over three yuan in cash on him. The detective reported the situation to the detective chief and had the body transported to the Tongren Funan Branch Hall examination room, awaiting inspection by personnel dispatched by the Qing Court today. Meanwhile, detectives from the police station were dispatched to investigate and arrest the fleeing murderer for prosecution.</p>
<p>The Huangpu River Still Has High Tides</p>
<p>The weather in this city has become increasingly overcast since yesterday, and the temperature continues to drop. However, from the 28th of this month, the Huangpu River will still have high tides, but the surge will be weaker, with a maximum not exceeding ten feet.</p>
<p>Punishment for Trafficking Girls</p>
<p>Hang Fubei, a Wuxi native residing at number 4, Shiye Lane, Gordon Road, has recently been unemployed and idle at home, unable to make a living. He conspired with bad friends, and on the afternoon of the 28th of last month, at 3:30 PM, he sneaked into the home of his fellow villager Wu Nanshan at number 310, Lane 1001, Xiaoshadu Road, and took the opportunity to abduct his seven-year-old daughter, Zhenxian, hiding her at the residence of his relative Liu Yu, number 66 Lane, Huangpu Road, French Concession, intending to find a buyer and sell her for money to spend. The case was discovered, and he was arrested by the Putuo Road Chinese and Western Detective Bureau and escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station requested a severe sentence. When questioned, the defendant confessed that due to poverty and inability to make a living, he abducted Wu's daughter, hoping that when her father wanted to find her, he would have to offer a reward, resorting to this desperate measure, and asked for leniency. Judge Huang sentenced Hang Fubei to two years of imprisonment as a warning. At the Jiangnan Copper Factory at number 20, junction of Haifang Road and Gordon Road, at around 7 AM yesterday morning, the furnace in the machine room exploded, injuring worker Wang Xuegao, 22 years old, a native of Yancheng. His nose and one right eye were blown off, and his head and face were injured, causing severe damage. He was later transported to the hospital by car for treatment.</p>
<p>Real Estate Tycoon Qu Hongsheng Receives the Funeral Plaque</p>

During his lifetime, he was fond of doing good deeds and charitable works, and spared no effort in supporting all social welfare undertakings. Now his family has chosen the 28th of this month to respectfully escort the coffin for burial at the family temple in Fahua Township, Daxilu, and will set up a memorial service at number 1510, junction of Avenue Road and Hardoon Road, the next day. At that time, with plain carriages and white horses, there will surely be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>

Here and in the East China Sea, there is fog in the morning and northeast winds. Also, in the fourteen hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 70.3 degrees and the lowest was 57.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 74.8 degrees and the lowest was 50.2 degrees.</p>
<h3>A Report on Shared Living - After Reading "A Small Suggestion"</h3>
<p>I don't know, sir, but your "Small Suggestion" perfectly suits my intentions. Moreover, I have been living a life similar to what you described since the day before "August 13th." Although it differs slightly from what you said, the savings are the same. Now, let me take advantage of this small space to report on my shared living:</p>
<p>In the half month before the war, everyone was busy looking for refuge, and of course, I was no exception. However, I organized the renting of the house beforehand, jointly uniting three households, agreeing that except for food and personal belongings, the rest would be shared equally, just like what you said, "without distinguishing between the second landlord and the third tenant." Everyone is the same. So, we rented a street-facing shikumen house in the French Concession and started what we call "shared living" the day before "August 13th." The rules of shared living are as follows:</p>
<p>Rent</p>
<p>Originally, the monthly rent was thirty-six yuan, divided into three shares, with each household paying only twelve yuan per month. However, since our three households have fewer people, we couldn't occupy so much space, so we rented out the front building for nine yuan per month. This way, each household saved another three yuan on rent, only having to pay nine yuan. I ask you, is it rare to pay such a low rent and live in a comfortable house on this isolated island? This is the first benefit of sharing.</p>
<p>Fuel</p>
<p>Initially, the three households shared a large briquette stove. A ton of briquettes could be burned for more than four months, with each household paying just over one yuan and two jiao per month. Later, because the briquette stove was too slow, we switched to a bellows coal stove, burning red base coal. Each ton cost around fifty yuan in national currency (coal prices were gradually rising at this time). From 5:00 AM (because all three of our households have the habit of getting up early) to 9:00 PM, the three households' breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as tea and everything else, all relied on this coal stove. Especially the bathwater in the summer was even more effective. However, each ton of coal also lasted an average of seven months, with each household spending only two yuan and four jiao per month. Even now that the price of coal is as high as eighty yuan per ton, we only spend a little over four yuan per month. This is the second benefit of sharing.</p>
<p>Just considering the above two benefits, we save a lot of money each month. Other expenses, such as property tax, electricity bills, even brooms, feather dusters, light bulbs, copper kettles for boiling water, and all public utilities, are shared equally. This is more economical than each household managing their own affairs. According to the recent three-month (July, August, and September) settlement, each household only spends a little over sixteen yuan per month (excluding clothing and food). It can truly be considered extremely cheap. This is all thanks to shared living. On the one hand, it also relies on everyone's sincere cooperation. If someone harbors selfish or self-serving thoughts, then they would not be able to enjoy these benefits.</p>
<p>Although my shared living differs slightly from what you said (not hiring maids, making all meals ourselves), because the housewives in each household have no children and are all unemployed, there is no need to hire maids. This not only allows us to take the opportunity to practice diligence but also reduces expenses during this time of national crisis.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that all the housewives on the isolated island, if they are living together, will organize themselves according to what I have said and see if the result "is more disadvantageous than each household managing their own affairs?" (Jin Yi)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: We also received a letter from a reader who listed several difficulties with "shared living," such as with meals, where one person wants to eat fish and another wants to eat meat; hiring a servant where the east family makes demands, and the west family still has to do it themselves. Such things certainly create many difficulties, but after reading Mr. Jin Yi's report, with everyone's sincere cooperation, this method seems to be feasible. However, this is a difficult life, not a life of eating fish and meat.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of the "Examination for Radio Operators" - Letter from Shanghai Da Wireless School</h3>
<p>Reporter:</p>
<p>Greetings, upon reading your newspaper's October 6th article "Experiences taking the Radio Operator Examination", which did not list a school name, and The Great American Evening News' subsequent article on the matter that mentioned our school, some of the text appears similar. However, the details of the event presented in these articles do not align with the truth. Our school has already written to the aforementioned newspaper to request a correction, and we would like to provide your publication with an accurate account of the examination's proceedings. To clarify, our school typically recommends outstanding graduates from within our institution to fill any relevant positions, rather than publicly advertising or soliciting applications. The recent examination for radio operators, ostensibly conducted by Gong Jicheng, a radio operator from Changde Shipping Company, was held at our school under the premise that he was seeking to recruit technical personnel for an inland organization. This was facilitated by a recommendation from a certain graduate of our institution. Mr. Gong indicated that he was approaching multiple wireless schools to conduct the examinations, and he was asked to disclose the organization that was seeking new hires, however, the reasons for secrecy remained unspecified due to the sensitivity of the current circumstances. Also, Mr. Gong is a professional already working in Shanghai and came highly recommended. The school then informed some students that they might want to try the examination. Since this recruitment was not done through public advertisements, there were no issues of false advertising. The five students who wrote to your publication were among those who took the exam at our institution because Mr. Gong had also contacted Mr. Zhang, the head of the wireless department at China No. 1 Vocational School, regarding the examination date. Mr. Zhang stated that the China No. 1 Vocational School did not have any free classrooms in the evening when the examination was to be held, so he sent a letter with 12 of his students and their photographs, as well as examination fee, to our school, requesting that they be allowed to attend the examination hosted by Mr. Gong at our institution and asking us to pass the examination fee on to Mr. Gong. Mr. Zhang's letter can verify this. The school was initially opposed to receiving the examination fees, but Mr. Gong claimed that it would help with the selection process. Thus, the five students from China No. 1 Vocational School applied at China No. 1 Vocational School, not at our school. Our school never published an advertisement for the examination. Later, Changde Shipping was delayed for several days by a hurricane. When Mr. Gong eventually came to the school to conduct the examination, the school sent someone to assist to show our sincerity. After the test, Mr. Gong said that the list of those who passed would be released when another wireless school had completed its examinations. This other wireless school would be openly recruiting radio operators. After the list of those who had passed was released, Mr. Gong came to the school to collect the examination fees. We told him that we would temporarily keep the money and then give it to him before the students left to work. Mr. Gong was then instructed to collect a deposit of 5 yuan from each member (a letter can be used to verify this). The school was concerned that this behavior looked suspicious, and they had an employee contact Mr. Gong and verify the information. A registered letter was then sent to the five students who wrote to your publication, advising them to come along. Seeing as the five students did not come, our school decided that Mr. Gong's behaviour was too suspicious and gave all of the students back their examination fees (as the five students noted in their letter to your publication). Mr. Gong's false recruitment is hatefull. Nevertheless, the school thought it would be okay to help out with the examination and did not suspect anything else. The school never borrowed its name to falsely recruit students, and it has no reason to make a profit from the situation. What does our school have to hide? Also, these five students applied for the examination at China No. 1 Vocational School with Mr. Zhang. Should China No. 1 Vocational School or the school be responsible for the application process? Now the school thinks that these five students have not investigated the origin of the matter and are making false accusations, or perhaps they have other intentions. The school has sent these five students a letter asking them to clarify the location where they applied for the examination. Did they apply for the examination at China No. 1 Vocational School or the school? The students have also been asked if China No. 1 Vocational School sent the applications to the school or if they came to the school on their own. This will help clarify the situation. (We have not heard back from them.) Therefore, the school is publishing the above information in your newspaper to correct the facts and to protect our reputation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Da Wireless School</p>
<h3>Reply to Colleagues of a Certain Company</h3>
<p>Dear Colleagues of a Certain Company:</p>
<p>It is every citizen's duty to donate warm clothing to the soldiers at the front. The personnel director's interference at your company is truly baffling. However, since your letter is not detailed, there may be some misunderstanding. Please explain the situation to your director, who has no reason to interfere with your patriotic actions. - The Editor</p>
<h3>Sending My Son to School</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>"The emperor values heroes, and writing instructs you, children. All other things are inferior, only studying is high." Because studying offers the hope of advancement, I sent my four-year-and-seven-month-old son to a model primary school, half through persuasion and half through intimidation. After the principal's simple oral test on the first day, he concluded that two conditions were sufficient for him to enter the first grade: first, that he had previously attended kindergarten; second, that he could write his name and recognize the Arabic numerals from one to ten. Thus, the problem of admission could be considered settled. However, a week later, the principal, based on the report of the first-grade teacher, proved that my son was not qualified for the first grade and provided ample evidence. This evidence was: he could not write a diary, so he had to be demoted to kindergarten. He added a supplementary remark that the standards of his school were indeed somewhat higher, followed by a knowing smile. I, based on the usual theory that a leper's head is better off left alone, was quite unconvinced. I first clarified that the Ministry of Education explicitly states that kindergarten cultivates group cooperation and initial group life, while the first grade of primary school only begins to impart intellectual skills. Now, requiring diary writing in the first grade indicates that first-grade children need to have acquired the tools of writing and already be able to use these tools to write a diary. I considered this to be excessive. However, the principal did not seem to accept my argument, but stated that the entire class could write diaries, except for my son, and the conclusion remained to uphold his decision. I, unable to resist, casually flipped through a diary of these children, whose level exceeds that of the Ministry of Education's mandate. It turned out that a page traced back to the heavy snow of half a year ago, which fell in the garden, as diary material, was recorded in the current start of the summer vacation. Only then did I understand the viewpoint of this homeroom teacher. I did not blame anyone else. If only my son had come back and discussed it with me earlier, I would have guaranteed to write a long eyewitness account of the German Western Front, which would be both tense and fresh. I complained that my son's lack of clever intelligence made me increase my indignation in vain.</p>
<p>The principal then used another fact to prove that his school's standards were indeed somewhat higher. He said that because the success rate of graduates entering higher schools best reflects the school's reputation, he had specially ordered that all fifth and sixth graders should study classical Chinese this year. This was one of his greatest achievements this year. However, I was unwilling to trouble myself further with a principal who held such views, to go and search for publications such as the primary school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education. I could only feel sorry for these children because all the unnecessary effort was constantly wasted by a principal who held such personal views. I sighed, and sighed without being able to say a word.</p>

<h3>Strange Tales from Overseas</h3>
<p>During the French Revolution, the Parisian mob swarmed to the Palace of Versailles, capturing the King, Queen, and Prince and taking them to Paris. As they walked, the mob shouted, "Now we have captured the bread-making master and mistress, and a little cook. From now on, we don't have to worry about not having bread!"</p>
<p>In the 19th century, Prussian King Frederick II was a man of great ambition and talent, and a famous figure in history. However, he only wore three suits of clothes in his lifetime and had a special habit: he had to rotate them every day.</p>
<p>After Louis XVI died, his queen, Marie Antoinette, was also killed. The revolutionary government recorded in the public accounts: "Paid to the widow of citizen Capet (Louis's surname) for the house, five francs." The house fee refers to the coffin fee.</p>
<p>The Danish capital, Copenhagen, recently enacted a new law: "It is forbidden for girls to stand and talk on the road, or they will be punished." This is because they often chat endlessly on the street, without regard to the danger of being hit by cars. (Charlie)</p>
<h3>Cleanliness and Hygiene of Bedding</h3>
<p>— Qintian</p>
<p>I know that clothes should be washed and changed frequently, but is it reasonable that bedding is not washed or changed frequently? It goes without saying that it is not good. Where is bedding most likely to get dirty? Of course, it is at the head, which receives saliva, mucus, and oil from the hair and face. It becomes dirty after a few days, so it should be washed at least once a week. However, washing the bedding once a week is too troublesome, so we should find a remedy. Namely, take a piece of white cloth and nail it to one end of the head of the bedding. This way, after four or five days, wash the white cloth once, and wash the bedding once every two weeks. That's good enough.</p>
<p>At the same time, the bedding should be sunned, because the bedding contains the carbon dioxide and sweat exhaled from the body, and it is easy to make the cotton loose. As soon as the carbon dioxide evaporates, all the bacteria in the bedding can be killed, so when the weather is sunny, all the bedding should be moved out and sunned.</p>
<p>Folding the bedding also makes a lot of sense. The old-fashioned Chinese method of folding bedding is to open the bedding, fold it in half, and then fold it three times. This way, the air trapped in the bedding can be released a little. However, the Western-style method of folding bedding is to tidy up the bedding and fold it into a square. This way, all the dirty air is hidden in the bedding. Or, the bedding is spread flat on the bed, with a sheet covering it. People think it looks beautiful, but they don't know that it hides dirt and filth. It is far from being as good as the Chinese-style method of folding bedding.</p>
<h3>Shoes and Socks of Hunan Female Students</h3>
<p>— Mingzhi</p>
<p>In the last issue of this publication, we talked about the homespun uniforms of Hunan students. Everyone knows about the clothing of Hunan students. Now I will talk about the shoes and socks of Hunan female students. The author has studied in Hunan for many years and is willing to introduce their shoes and socks to everyone:</p>
<p>Their clothes all year round are a plain homespun jacket and a short plain homespun skirt. As for shoes, from spring to winter, they are just a pair of plain homespun shoes. They never wear leather shoes or woollen shoes. Their whole bodies are homespun, without a trace of foreign goods. The people of Hunan love their country more than any other province, and they also supervise each other, so they wear a pair of plain homespun shoes all year round.</p>
<p>As for socks, they cannot wear any colors other than black and white. Wearing silk stockings is even out of the question.</p>
<p>If you compare them with female students in Shanghai, what do you think?</p>
<h3>A Clever Way to Reduce Car Accidents</h3>
<p>— Lu Degang</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of cars has been increasing day by day. Therefore, car accidents are also becoming more and more common. This is of course a very serious threat to traffic safety.</p>
<p>The cause of car accidents is mostly because the driving speed is too fast. Therefore, American car manufacturers now specially install a clever phonograph on the newly manufactured cars. If the driver exceeds a speed of 100 kilometers per hour, the phonograph will automatically emit a solemn tone, continuously warning the driver, "Be careful! You are going to have an accident!" If the speed exceeds 130 kilometers per hour, the phonograph will emit an angry tone, saying, "Either you will kill yourself, or a pedestrian will be run over by you!" If the speed reaches 150 kilometers per hour, the phonograph will play a mournful funeral march, making the driver feel frightened and have to reduce the speed.</p>
<p>Also, everyone knows that car accidents are very related to the driver's carefulness and skills. Therefore, in some American cities with perfect road administration, plainclothes patrolmen often pay attention to the driver's skills and carefulness on the road at any time. If they find drivers with excellent driving skills, they will give them some movie tickets for Sunday as a reward. On the other hand, if they see drivers who are careless or have poor skills, even if they have not caused an accident, they will be given a considerable warning to prevent accidents before they happen.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the above two methods, the number of car accidents in the United States has indeed decreased a lot, giving the issue of traffic safety more powerful protection!</p>
<h3>Economic Menu for a Week</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Shepherd's purse is on the market again. Although this thing is a kind of vegetable, it is like soybean sprouts, which naturally contain umami, as if it naturally carries MSG-like seasoning powder. Shepherd's purse is originally wild. Children in the countryside often dig it in the fields at any time, calling it "picking shepherd's purse". Because it doesn't cost much, the price is relatively cheap, but once it gets to the shepherd's purse market in Shanghai, it certainly won't be that cheap. Stir-fried shepherd's purse is good, and adding some tofu or dried tofu shreds will do. To be more particular, you can have stir-fried shepherd's purse with winter bamboo shoots, which is qualified to be added to a high-end banquet. If you want to make a common home-style dish, then stir-fried shepherd's purse with shredded pork, or stir-fried pork slices, shepherd's purse pork diced tofu soup, shepherd's purse minced pork stuffed gluten or fried tofu. If you want to be more particular, then stir-fried shepherd's purse with chicken slices, stir-fried shepherd's purse with shrimp, stir-fried shepherd's purse with kidney flowers, etc., are all suitable. It doesn't matter where it is in my economic menu, it has its place.</p>

<h3>General Xue Yue's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>General Xue Yue possesses a personality that is both resolute and modest; his demeanor is stern yet upright; and his decisive strategies are marked by both wisdom and courage. He dedicates all of his time and energy entirely to his work. Moreover, due to his robust physique, his personal life is simple and frugal, much like that of an ordinary person. He rarely wears civilian clothes and seldom dons a hat. Fine silks and satins are completely foreign to him. From morning till night, from spring to winter, cycle after cycle, he wears his military uniform. The only difference is the material, changing from grey cloth to serge to thick wool, depending on the weather. His physique has a strong resistance to both heat and cold. For example, due to the urgency of military affairs, he can wear the same set of clothes for an extended period, wearing spring attire in summer and summer attire in autumn, without feeling discomfort.</p>
<p>While people naturally have constitutions inclined towards heat or cold, and their digestive abilities also vary in strength, this is not the case with him. He seems to have no food intolerances and does not need to select dishes to suit his taste. Every day, the cook prepares his meals, and the orderly brings them to him. Because he is at the front lines, salted provisions often outnumber fresh vegetables and tea. He often relies on salted fish and shrimp as his only side dishes. He originally does not like spicy food, but Hunan Province is a chili-producing region, with chilies growing everywhere during the summer and autumn seasons. Consequently, every meal includes chili peppers, which he has become accustomed to.</p>
<p>His living arrangements, considering the time and place of his fighting, are difficult to describe. Although he is the Commander-in-Chief of the ×th War Area and concurrently the Chairman of Hunan Province, his enjoyment of sleep is sometimes less comfortable than ours. Two door panels and a cotton blanket are commonplace, yet he sleeps soundly and happily. If he is on the march, he, like his soldiers, shelters in mountain areas, dilapidated temples, or humble alleys; he conducts official business and rests on rocky slopes or muddy ground, wherever he finds himself. Because he does not have a fixed base of operations, his family does not stay with him, and he has no private residence to speak of.</p>
<p>Traveling is originally a strength of the army. Walking hundreds of miles continuously is nothing to them. Climbing mountains and crossing ridges is like city dwellers visiting a 'rooftop garden,' a feat that leaves modern people speechless. Although the highways throughout the interior are open, some areas still require the use of one's own two feet, so he is able to walk and run. However, to save time, he mostly travels by car or on horseback, riding across the Hunan-Hubei border region, leveraging his strengths to secure the eternal freedom and survival of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Here, we sincerely salute the national warrior and eagerly await the continuing reports of victory.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk about Spittoons</h3>
<p>— Four Five Six</p>
<p>A spittoon is, of course, used to hold sputum, but in reality, it is not always used for that purpose. Children, having nowhere else to relieve themselves, use the spittoon as a chamber pot, which has become a common sight. This phenomenon is most prevalent in doctors' clinics. On ships, unless there are no spittoons, they will certainly be full of urine.</p>
<p>The spittoons in hotels are not meant for spitting. Besides receiving tea dregs, they contain a great variety of contents, including cigarette butts, orange peels, banana peels, and even cotton swabs soaked in medicine. This is something no one would expect. In the morning, the hotel servants come out to empty the spittoons, and many petty thieves wait nearby, competing to scavenge for valuable items. What they like most are the orange peels, which, after being cleaned, can be sold to candy stores to make preserved orange peel. We pay a high price to buy preserved orange peel and find the taste quite good. However, if we knew it was made from orange peels from spittoons, we would vomit up even the previous night's dinner.</p>
<p>In the past, there were several large spittoons in the train station, almost as big as small stone tanks, arguably the largest spittoons in all of China. These spittoons were often used as flowerpots in our country, while the Japanese bought them to use as fire basins, resulting in considerable sales each year.</p>
