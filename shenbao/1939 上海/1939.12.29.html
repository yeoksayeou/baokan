<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c13">今年中國對外貿易回顧 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>今年中國的對外貿易數額，已由海關發表到十一月份爲正：總計前十一個月，進口洋貨値國幣十二億元，出口土貨値九億元，貿易差額爲入超三億元。就埠別貿易言，以上海爲最多，其决爲華北的天津靑島秦皇島等處，再次爲華南的龍州汕頭蒙自。就貿易國別言，進口日本占第一位，其决爲美國，英屬印度，旅大租借地，德國等處；出口以美國居首席，其决爲香港，日本，英國，安南等處。就進出口商品言，洋貨進口最多的是雜糧及雜糧粉，其决爲棉花及棉製品，燭皂，汕脂，金屬，礦砂，什貨等物；出口土貨則以動物及其產品爲最多，其决爲紡織纖維，礦砂，金屬製品，編織品和什貨等物</p>
<p>戰事發生以來的中國對外貿易，因有種種複雜關係，很難表現共眞實狀况。此中最大原因，當由：（一）沿海交通的被人封鎖，失去正常貿易機會，因此進出口的走私非常猖獗；（二）海關撤退以後的各通商口岸，海關冊雖沒有進出口商品的記載，實際上仍有大量貿易存在；（三）海關所統計的貨値，對於關金國幣相互折合，係按法定匯價計算；但在淪陷區域內的外匯價格，有所謂黑市的發生，致使海關按照法價所估計的價値，與實際價値大有出入。例如今年前十個月的進出口貿易數額，據海關統計出口的爲進口的百分之六十六，偶見遠來商業金融週報以英鎊市價折合的數額，則出口祗占進口百分之二十八，相差頗爲巨大。故上述海關所發表的貿易數字，實在也祗是一個大槪的悄况；根據這種大槪情形，最値得我們注意的約有下列幾點：</p>
<p>第一今年進出口貿易數額，都較去年同期巨大；而入超的數額，更大於去年的三倍。表面上似較去年允爲惡化，實際却不盡然，今年對外貿易看來之所以特別惡化，乃由上半年進口過多的關係；自國民政府於七月間開始嚴厲統制進出口貿易之後，悄形便已逐漸好轉，出口增加而進口减少。例如最近十一月份的出口，巳大過進口，而爲出超五千萬元，可見統制貿易政策，確已獲得巨大的效果。</p>
<p>其次在今年的國別貿易中，日本占進口第一位置，的爲二億九千萬元（均以十一個月計）；實際上當然不祇此數，但卽以此數爲準，較去年同期增加百分之六十，便是較去年同期增加一倍以上。日貨運向中國旅大租借地的，今年値九千二百萬元，的爲前年的十倍。此外僅美國無多大變化；而英德荷印法等國，莫不大减特减。至於今年由中國輸往日本的，僅爲六千萬元，比較前年去年都减少；這也祇是關冊的數字，實際上由淪陷區域逕行輸往日本的很多，必定不止此數。他如一部分的日本工業向中國移動，這也是减少出口的另一綠因。輸往英美的今年雖較去年略有增加，但和戰前相差不遠。輸往德法南洋各地的則都一律衰落。這種變化的情形，怕就是日本創造所謂「東亞新秩序」的結果，致使與中國具有貿易關係的各國權益，在日本獨占遠東的企圖下，都快要被壟斷把持而消滅凈盡了。</p>
<p>再决，今年所進口的商品，還是以日常生活的必需品及奢侈品爲最多。自去年七月，國民政府實行禁止一部分內地有代替物的日常用品及全部奢侈品進口後，在關冊上本不應再有這類商品的巨大數額；而現時居然還有偌大數宇的日用品和奢侈品的進口，自然由於淪陷區域人民儘量享受的關係。近數月來淪陷區域因外匯見縮及歐戰關係，進口已大見减少；例如上海十月份的進口，祇有二千六百餘萬元，僅爲出口的百分之三十五；而十一月份祗有二千五百萬元，的爲出口的百分之二十七。這是上海對外貿易史上很少見的現象。淪陷區域人民若能覺悟到這時消耗外匯的不當，因而極力節縮自己的浪費，對於國家必能有更大的補益。</p>
<p>今年的對外貿易，在環境上比較前年更爲困難：汕頭淪陷之後，日軍又在北海一帶登陸；戰區的擴大，使中國海上通路不易維持；加之日本不僅儘可能地控制中國商品的輸出入，禁止外商在中國自由航行，直接干涉他們貿易的活動；並還從貨幣金融及其他各方面，間接來破壞他們貿易的進行。可是據海關統計所示，最近的貿易，仍還有逐漸好轉的現象。這也就足以充分顯示中國對日的經濟戰爭，也在充分的勝利把握當中。</p>
<p>不過將來我們覺得足以影響到中國對外貿易方面的，還有二事：一爲歐洲大戰；一爲日本在華南的軍事行動，歐戰有認爲可以使貿易好轉的，因其可以减少輸入而增加輸出；但就中國現勢言，减少輸入是可能的，增加輸出則雖以現時中國的輸出貿易在政府統制之下，大有增加的機會，但因運輸困難而將大大减少作用。至於淪陷區域的輸出，屬於原料的爲數有限，並且有許多重要商品，如棉花·生絲·米糧等，都巳在日本獨佔統制之下出口，外匯當然也是在日本把持之中。他如工業品，則由國外輸入原料，經過製造後再輸往國外，未必有利可圖；而利用淪陷區域原料製造的出口貨，當然又祇有日本工廠獨佔其利益了。至於日軍在西南的軍事行動，共目的固在截斷海口，甚至破壞陸路國際交通；但這也不足以予中國對外貿易以若何打擊。中國沿海一帶可作輸出口岸的很多，除非日本完全占領沿海各地，或根本禁止第三國商船沿海航行，吾則福州寗波溫州或共他各地，仍當可以成爲貿易港口。並且縱令日本封鎖海口，而國際陸地交通絕不致於斷絕，中國的對外貿易，當然還是可以有她的順利前途的。</p>

<p>上海泰晤十報云、海救火會主任昨（二十七日）向記者談稱、巳往一年來、救火會在公共租界內與界外數區救火共計一一〇〇次、實破紀錄、由此可表示華人建築界今有建造不堅而甚易燃的建築物之趨勢、此數字於昨晨之前、尙係一〇九九起、但昨晨某船不戒於火、毀棉八包、遂使本年一月一日以還之起火决數、達一千一百起之多、前數年間紀錄之</p>
<p>失火次數　雖逐年激增、但遠不若木年之多、而巳往數年來之紀錄、所以逐年打破者、乃因公共租界內人口增多之故、允以屢次大火之西區爲最、房屋建造不堅而易燃、則失火後迅即蔓延、使附近房屋、感受危險、公共租界有奏效之救火會、故火警次數、始能不致超出目前數字、已往三十九年來火警總數之遞增、</p>
<p>頗足驚奇　一九〇〇年間、公共租界與法和界發生火警共僅一一九决、一九〇七年、法租界自行組織救火會、故數字稍减、一九一〇年間、僅失火一一五次、五年後、數已倍之、共後漸增、至一九二〇年爲三一五次、一九二五年爲五七四次、一九三七年共九〇六次、一九三八年一〇五六次、本年則將逾一·一〇〇次、此數中以草屋集居地、及以易燃物蓋成之小商店與</p>
<p>工廠失火　爲最多、且多在西區、此等房屋、恒以易燃之木板忽據蓋成、或僅係草屋、易於失火、而迅即四處波及、因此等草屋之所在地、恒在住宅與商店之包圍中、僅有一二狹徑可通、故失火後、幾每次有傷亡情事、此種易燃之建築、對於生命、乃一</p>
<p>嚴重危險　恒有起火之處、但無負責者有效的處理此事、及限制建造此種危險房屋、火警增加之另一因素、爲許多華商小工廠、對於製造貨物所用具有高度危險性之物品、加以忽視、例如製造鐵床者不知所用之澱粉爲如何危險、乃有愛多亞路某鐵床店起火、於數分鐘內</p>

<p>— 俞心</p>
<p>寫在車資增加聲中</p>
<p>畢了紀方君的「電車加價」，使我感覺到生活在「孤島」上的居民，的確更又加多了一重負擔，使中下的薪給階級者祇有叫苦連天。</p>
<p>但是薪給階級到底是或許還能自給，直接受到最嚴重打擊的，卻是學生界了。因為每一個學校中的學生，住址離開學校很遠的很多，為了恐怕遲到等等的關係，於是不得不借助車子來代步。祇要看每天早晨的電車或公共汽車中，常常擁擠着大批手中拿了書籍的學生。我想其中家庭經濟較困難也頗不乏人，父兄的血汗來維持浩大的學費和書籍的費用，已是足够受累，何況現在又要來負擔一支加之又加說小不小的車資呢？所以我們急起謀有設法補救的必要啊。</p>
<p>我以學生的資格，來向全「孤島」的同伴們提一個建議—用我們的雙腳跑向人行道上去。</p>
<p>我是在福州路××中學讀書，家庭狀況也很平常。起先是坐公共汽車的，後來公共汽車漲價，便改乘電車了。但是電車又在二十二日來一個漲價，於是我開始用自己的十一路車「一雙腳」，祇要在每天清晨比平常早出門半小時，在八　時前儘可走到校中。這樣非但省了車錢，而且可以得着一個運動的機會，因為走路實在是一種很好的「經濟運動」。在這「旣省錢，又健身」的極好機會中，我們還得要向車商當局「道謝」這好機會的賜與。</p>
<p>下面便是作者向校中開「兩腳車」的同學們問得來的走路大約所需的時間，以為各校同學的參考（以南京路拋球場為終點，因彼處為學校集中之處）：</p>
<p>起自王家沙，約需半小時一小時。</p>
<p>自福煦路同孚路口，約需半小時。</p>
<p>自菜市路辣斐德路口，約需四十分鐘。</p>
<p>自辣斐德路拉都路口，約需一小時（餘可類推）。</p>
<h3 id="c93">結息的夜工作 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 余香芸</p>
<p>銀行生活的片段</p>
<p>一年兩次，那麼機械式的，結息的日子，又隨着Cliristmas而來了。每所社會經濟樞紐約銀行裏都因而展開了夜工作。</p>
<p>冬天的晚上，尖峭的西北風，呼刮於都市的領空，一切動的，靜的，都在寒冷的氣流下瑟縮地倦伏着。然而，這些鋼骨水泥或雲母石大理石凝結鑲雕的高大建築裏是沒有冬天的，一層一層都像晚春的四月天，那麼地溫柔！和暖！電炬的光輝，水汀的熱浪，好像組成了一個綱幕，籠罩着這五手捧「金飯碗」的一群。</p>
<p>整齊而有規律擺着的寫字檯上，堆滿了雜亂的單據和賬簿，鋼筆，墨水，算盤，圖章，控制了每個人的神經，捲起袖管，低頭屈背，心和腦的智慧，完全灌注在數字的轉變中；算盤聲尤如一關歡樂和憂鬱混合的曲調，緊張地，連接地交奏着。這樣不停息的忙碌，絕不像日間那樣部份地有緊張，也有清閑。夜工作的忙碌卻是一致的，四面八方都是同一步驟的忙錄着：口啣煙斗的　主任，傳遞單據的練習生和茶房，工作也都緊張，每個人手不停揮，寫着，算着結出了別人命運，也結出了自己的命運—虧欠或盈餘。</p>
<p>在錢袋堆中打滾的人們，心裏對於金錢的數目，畢竟不比普通人那麼奇罕，有味。儲蓄部裏結存幾百萬的就付結幾十萬的利息，結存幾十萬的就付結幾萬的利息，結存幾元的也付結幾分的幾厘的利息，數字的多寡，就在他們的算盤和筆尖上產生出來。接着，又很平淡的把它移過去，結了一戶又一戶。那商業往來部的欠息，也是照着數額很平淡的結了一戶又一戶，所不同的只是利率的高低而已。</p>
<p>這樣一個偌大的夜工作的場合，就像是一部龐大的機器，一部替資本家紀錄資本流動器呵！我們的確不能否認別人說我們銀行員的生活是機械，也不能拒絕接受別人贈給我人閏個「金錢奴隸」的雅號。我一面做一面這樣想。</p>
<p>時間雖然不停息地在溜去，我們卻還希望它是走得快些；空氣雖然是緊張的，整個場合雖我是熱鬧的，然而個別的感覺卻是寂寞的，在熱鬧中的寂寞，較沙漠中的寂寞是更要悽切的！每個人做得倦膩了，就伸伸腰，心上僅能浮起一個很單純的希望—吃一頓夜點心。</p>
<p>夜點心下了肚，像火車加足了煤，像機器加足了油，又重復開動工作，直到曙光劃開了東天的黑暗，每個人才伸一伸腰，拖着疲倦的步子，走出門，冒着寒冷的冬天的晨風，寂然歸去。</p>

<p>一條幾百家人口的巷裏，祇裝有二架秋水龍頭。</p>
<p>水在巷裏，就像沙漠裏的池那樣名貴。</p>
<p>一早就許多的人，爭搶着裝水，提着鉛桶，拿着木盆，擁擠着，嘈雜着，…</p>
<p>在燒飯的時候，這喧鬧聲更像狂風一樣捲起來；有的被踏落了鞋子，有時小孩子擁得啼呌，為了爭先，婦女們吵罵着，偶然，還會打起架來，揪着，想把對方搶着的水踢潑去，…</p>
<p>巷子裏的水像仙靈哪！</p>
<p>（四）嬰孩戳殺</p>
<p>巷裏最可怖的，就是戮殺嬰兒。</p>
<p>貧苦人的生殖率，反比例地增高着；巷裏的婦女沒有能空閒的；洗衣燒飯，誰有空哺着孩子呢？可是誰也不能阻止婦人的還孕，有了孕得養出孩子，家裏的負担，已够累了，怎能替嬰孩費手腳，多加高一層不能支持的負担呢？</p>
<p>凄慘地，把新生的嬰兒，窒息他的呼吸；幼小的嬰兒，剛投向世上，沒有生長，重歸返土中…</p>
<p>前巷的，把它投向後巷；後面的，恰又拋棄到前面來。</p>
<p>在角落裏，老發現蒲包，血淋淋的嬰兒，有的還有布裏着，有的卻赤裸裸的；他的命運是悲慘的，給母親以生理上的摧殘，給爸以不可消滅的沉痛印象，剛也了母胎，就被貧苦慘害，…</p>
<p>巷子裏，大家日復一日地度着；嬰孩的生命，那够得上富家的狗；不平的遭遇，可不是睜開眼睛就有麼？（完）</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十九回　看花賞月活動成家　種玉孕珠娠任有術</p>
<p>金澹雲道：「有你在座了，有說有笑，熱鬧了許多。因此我最喜歡和你在一處兒游玩，因為你是一個最有興趣的人。」吳君素道：「從前或者如此，以後可不然了。現在有了姊夫陪你，何必再要妹妹呢？」金澹雲道：『要是這樣，我這蜜月旅行，也不請你們加入了。』後來吳君素答應：不必去接她，下星期六她再到上海來。本來她的家，就在上海，來來往往，已是慣常了的。火車上以及車站上全認得這位東吳大學敎書的吳小姐了。到了明天，便是林建成金澹雲結婚的正日了。上午沒有事，要到下午三點鐘，開始熱鬧起來。從蘇州來吃喜酒的一班小姐們，大家各事其事。朱愛人去訪問她的幾位同事，有的是服務於各醫院的，有的是自己開業的。不過自己開業，也是醫院形式的多。因為近來害病的人，都喜歡住醫院。除了那些小病的人，仍舊在執着業務的人，弄些藥吃吃，或是在家靜養兩三天就可痊愈的以外，覺得生了病，還是進醫院為宜。一則，到底醫院裏設備完善，有看護，有醫生，隨時可以照料。而且近來醫學上種種器械的發明，日新月異。小巧的東西，醫師們或可以携帶，但有些卻是裝置在一個地方，連移動都不能移動的，怎能便利不到醫院裏　的病人呢？這自然只有病人去移尊就敎了。并且上海這個地方，雖然比戰前又擴大了，然而人口還是密集，繁盛的區域裏，房屋還是很擠，在家裏養病，究不相宜。再則，因為願進醫院的人多，原來的幾個醫院不够了，常常鬧到醫院裏街客滿牌。於是稍遠的，也添了不少的小醫院，醫師必須登記，醫院當然更要登記，要合法的方許你開設，不能像從前那些私家醫院，可以隨隨便便的了。但是也仍有許多人，生了病，不願到醫院，不能到醫院的，那末延醫到家診治，也是有的。但衛生局以及醫師公會，去規定一定的診金，每次診金，不許超出十元以外。而且不許加出什麼早診，晚診，特診急診的種種名目，以使病家多所負擔。</p>

<p>— 恕</p>
<p>死了丈夫生活感到單調　對銀幕生活表示頗厭倦</p>
<p>前米高梅公司副總理歐文泰爾堡之遺妻瑙瑪希拉，自一九二四年正式隸屬於米高梅的旗幟之下後，差不多已將近二十年的歷史，雖然在她丈夫死後的那年，曾一度停止過七個多月的水銀燈生活，但終因為公司當局再三的要求她恢復工作，於是接着又開始攝製了「當罏帝后」「閨怨」「鑄情」「絕代艷后」等十餘片，據統計所得，在她開始攝製主演的第一部影片「歌姬慘史」，一直到最近攝製完成的「白衣情女」止，一共已主演了</p>
<p>六十三部名作，可以說，祇要是她主演的作品，在世界各國戲院公映時，是沒有一片不是有驚人的賣座。所以有人大約計算過，米高梅公司單是她一個人的作品裏，至少已凈賺了三萬萬美金，不過她所以能够至老賣座不衰的原因，還是因為她的演技并不因年齡的增加，而有所衰退，這也是她超人獨長之處。其次因為她主演的影片裏，十之八九都是飾演悲劇的主角，而她卻能用各種不同輕描淡寫的手法，表演出各個不同的個性，就像最近我們看到的「鑄情」和「閨怨」二片，就是更顯著的明證。可以大膽地說，在目前整個的好萊塢，恐怕已找不出第二個像她一樣會</p>
<p>演悲劇的角色，瑙瑪希拉今年已滿足三十八歲了，所以已進入中年婦人的階段裏，因此她常常對她知己的朋友說：『假使公司裏再要我繼續不斷地拍戲的話，那末無疑地是等於叫我早入墳墓。』她又說：「自從丈夫死後，生活所感到的祇是單調寂寞，什麼都不感到興趣，真好像失去了母親的羔羊，無處是我的歸宿，因為前途的希望，已到了絕境，不能再進入</p>
<p>另一個樂園裏，現在她唯一的希望，就是祇有一個七歲的幼女，雖然她是怎樣的聰明，但她卻又像母親一樣的多病，不是呻吟在床塌上，就是讀着聖母的教訓，所以我現祇希望，能够</p>
<p>把她撫養長大眞的，大眾都深信她，假使她沒有這個幼女的話，或許早已息影銀壇，而獨自去度那寡人清靜的幽閒生活了。</p>
<p>這幾年來，突然的她對於這種水銀燈下的刻苦工作，忽然又常常在朋友前發出種種的煩言，甚至還詛咒這種非人的工作，現在她最怕的是讀腳本，重色化裝，唱情歌這三件事，不過她現在并不是已不能勝任，因為這幾件事，大槪使她已不發生興趣，的確，瑙瑪希拉是老了，說不定沒有多時，將不再使我們與她在銀幕上會見了。</p>

<p>綠野仙踨是以色　　調，與神的奇蹟來標新立異。過去的「仲夏夜之夢」，劇情進展，陷於沈悶與象徵的缺憾，雖在神奇方面，有相當的成功；「白雪公主」的欣賞味，够行上「十分精彩」四字定評，可異人物的描繪是死的，限於畫筆的鈎勒，不能充分作神情上的發揮；這部「綠野仙蹤」採擷兩片的精華，加以精密的處理，無論構圖色彩表演與劇情上，「鄭重其事」的調整。它的劇情是偕一個鄕姑夢遊仙境，帶出稻草人錫樵夫懦獅二個人物，稻草人是沒有頭腦，錫樵夫是沒有良心，懦獅是沒有勇氣；四人結伴訪仙，中途經過不少的麿折，都憑着四人的努力，打破了一切難關。結果鄕姑被擒，掃帶精示威，到底仗着三位一體的鼓勇前進，稻草人運用巧思，錫樵夫發動良知，懦獅鼓足勇氣，救出了鄕姑，三位的弱點，終於自我地糾正了。</p>
<p>全片顏色，鮮艷奪目。它把每一個人物個性描繪，用顏色來象徵一切，色調的配合，也達高峰。在矮仙國裏的仙男仙女，全是不滿三尺的侏儒，也是難得，至於神話片應有的騰雲駕霧，呼風喚雨，魔火十丈，霞光萬道，也有巧妙的演出。「綠野仙蹤」的監製人是茂文李洛埃，導演是維多佛利敏，都是影界名宿，主演的女角是裘蒂珈綸。</p>

<p>新春秋戲劇學校的產生，在今年孤島的敎育界似乎哄動了一時。這次由該校主辦慈善遊藝大會，假好萊塢樂團舉行，昨日第一場表演的話劇「野草閑花」，是那些被錄取的同學在三個月訓練下的藝術結晶。</p>
<p>「野草閑花」是由李君磐所編寫的。并經國語專家　工上君　改對白。故事，是敘述一個大少爺跟一個茶房的女兒私地裏結了婚，婚後兩年，不料大少爺的父親又要　他另行訂婚。結果對方竟到法院去近年控告重婚，大少爺的父親知道和平的解決沒有希望，也只好請了多年老友曾任法官的律師代為辦理。一庭審過，推事因　兩邊先試和解，於是大律師把原告請到事務所來，誰知道一次談話，竟給律師發現所謂茶房的女兒，卻是自己廿年前的愛人所出，同時他明白自己懷念了將近廿年的愛人，就在他們倆愛情結晶誕生後的三年窮苦而死了。而大少爺呢，卻又突然覺悟到要爭取婚姻的自由非擺脫封建家庭的枷鎖不可，跟父親起了衝突，重行請出證人，與茶房的女兒再度結婚。</p>
<p>演員方面，因為該校的同學全是年輕的孩子，由於經驗，或者更由於修養缺少緣故吧，雖然在化裝上盡了能事，在演出，總還顯得生硬，強調。</p>
<p>相倜餘小余，他　動的輕佻，跟老練的談吐是不相稱的；又是那麼拘束；胡峰之飾茶房，缺少了謹慎；陳產戚之飾大少爺，顯得不自然，但他們還是第一次上臺，而且僅僅只學習了三個月，還是不可厚非的吧。</p>
<p>另外該提的是飾大少爺父親的施從厚。他不論在更好，動作上，都符和一個上了年紀的紳士的態度。其次，飾律師的徐佐民也很能發揮。</p>

<h3 id="e13">A Review of China's Foreign Trade This Year <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The figures for China's foreign trade this year, which have been released by Customs up to November, are as follows: In the first eleven months, imports of foreign goods totaled 1.2 billion national currency, and exports of domestic goods totaled 900 million. The trade balance showed a deficit of 300 million. In terms of trade by port, Shanghai had the largest volume, followed by Tianjin, Qingdao, Qinhuangdao and other places in North China, and then Longzhou, Shantou, Mengzi and other places in South China. In terms of trade by country, Japan ranked first in imports, followed by the United States, British India, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Germany and other places; the United States ranked first in exports, followed by Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom, Annam and other places. In terms of import and export commodities, the largest import of foreign goods was grains and grain flours, followed by cotton and cotton products, candles, soaps, tallow, metals, minerals, sundries and other items; the largest export of domestic goods was animals and their products, followed by textile fibers, minerals, metal products, woven goods and sundries.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, China's foreign trade has been difficult to present its true picture due to various complex relationships. The biggest reasons for this are: (1) Coastal transportation being blockaded, losing normal trade opportunities, thus smuggling of imports and exports is extremely rampant; (2) After the customs retreated, the customs records of various trading ports did not record imported and exported goods, but a large amount of trade still existed in practice; (3) The value of goods recorded by Customs is calculated according to the legal exchange rate for the mutual conversion of customs duties and national currency; However, the exchange rate in the occupied areas has the so-called black market, which makes the value estimated by Customs according to the legal price very different from the actual value. For example, for the first ten months of this year, according to Customs statistics, exports accounted for 66% of imports. According to the figures converted at the market price of the British pound in the occasional Far East Commercial and Financial Weekly, exports only accounted for 28% of imports, a huge difference. Therefore, the above-mentioned trade figures published by the Customs are actually just a rough situation; based on this rough situation, the following points are most worthy of our attention:</p>
<p>First, the amount of import and export trade this year is greater than the same period last year; and the amount of the trade deficit is more than three times that of last year. On the surface, it seems to be worse than last year, but this is not entirely the case. The reason why foreign trade seems particularly bad this year is due to the excessive imports in the first half of the year; After the National Government began to strictly control import and export trade in July, the situation has gradually improved, with exports increasing and imports decreasing. For example, the recent exports in November exceeded imports by 50 million yuan, which shows that the policy of controlling trade has indeed achieved great results.</p>
<p>Secondly, in this year's trade by country, Japan accounted for the first place in imports, with 290 million yuan (all based on eleven months); in fact, it is certainly more than this, but even based on this number, it is an increase of 60% compared with the same period last year, which is more than double the increase compared with the same period last year. The value of Japanese goods shipped to the Kwantung Leased Territory in China this year was 92 million yuan, ten times that of the year before. In addition, only the United States has not changed much; while countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, India and France have greatly reduced their imports. As for what China shipped to Japan this year, it was only 60 million yuan, which is less than in the previous year and last year; This is just the number on the customs register. In reality, a lot of goods are shipped directly from the occupied areas to Japan, and it must be more than this number. Other such factors as the relocation of some Japanese industries to China, is another reason for the decrease in exports. Although exports to the United Kingdom and the United States have increased slightly this year compared with last year, they are not far from those before the war. Exports to Germany, France, and Nanyang have all declined uniformly. The situation of this change, I am afraid, is the result of Japan creating the so-called "New Order in East Asia", which has caused the rights and interests of various countries with trade relations with China to be quickly monopolized and controlled under Japan's attempt to monopolize the Far East, and will be eliminated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the goods imported this year are still mostly necessities and luxury goods for daily life. Since the National Government implemented a ban on the import of some daily necessities and all luxury goods that could be substituted by domestic products in July last year, there should no longer be such a large number of these commodities in the customs records; but at present, there are still such large imports of daily necessities and luxury goods, which is naturally due to the people in the occupied areas enjoying them as much as possible. In recent months, imports in the occupied areas have greatly decreased due to the shrinking foreign exchange and the European war; for example, imports in Shanghai in October were only more than 26 million yuan, only 35% of exports; and in November, they were only 25 million yuan, which was only 27% of exports. This is a rare phenomenon in the history of Shanghai's foreign trade. If the people in the occupied areas can realize that it is inappropriate to consume foreign exchange at this time, and thus try to reduce their waste, it will definitely be of greater benefit to the country.</p>
<p>This year's foreign trade is facing more difficulties in the environment than in the previous year: after the fall of Shantou, the Japanese army landed in the Beihai area; the expansion of the war zone makes it difficult to maintain China's sea passages; In addition, Japan not only controls the import and export of Chinese goods as much as possible, prohibits foreign businessmen from freely navigating in China, and directly interferes with their trade activities; it also indirectly undermines the trade through currency, finance and other aspects. However, according to the statistics of the Customs, the recent trade still shows a gradual improvement. This is also sufficient to fully show that China's economic war against Japan is also fully confident of victory.</p>
<p>However, in the future, we feel that there are still two things that will affect China's foreign trade: one is the European war; the other is Japan's military operations in South China. Some believe that the European war can improve trade because it can reduce imports and increase exports; but in terms of China's current situation, it is possible to reduce imports. Although the current Chinese export trade is under government control, there is a great opportunity to increase exports, but due to transportation difficulties, the effect will be greatly reduced. As for the exports of the occupied areas, the number of raw materials is limited, and many important commodities, such as cotton, raw silk, rice, etc., have been exported under the sole control of Japan, and foreign exchange is of course also controlled by Japan. As for industrial products, it may not be profitable to import raw materials from foreign countries, manufacture them, and then export them; and of course, only Japanese factories will monopolize the profits of export goods manufactured using raw materials from the occupied areas. As for the Japanese military operations in the southwest, their purpose is to cut off the seaports and even destroy land international transportation; but this is not enough to give China's foreign trade any blow. There are many seaports along the Chinese coast that can be used as import and export ports. Unless Japan completely occupies all coastal areas or completely prohibits merchant ships of third countries from sailing along the coast, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou or other places should still be able to become trading ports. And even if Japan blockades the seaports, international land transportation will never be cut off, and China's foreign trade will of course still have a smooth future.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Many Hidden Reefs in US-Japan Relations: Situation After the Abolition of the Commercial Treaty; US Authorities Have Not Made Specific Statements; Instead, They Demand Various Guarantees from Japan; There is Still a Possibility of Implementing Moral Sanctions; Japanese Newspapers Believe the US is Interfering in the Sino-Japanese War <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: Newspapers here today admitted that US Ambassador to Japan Grew did not offer any definite assurances when speaking with Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura regarding the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty in January of next year. Therefore, the newspapers warned the Japanese people that while a no-treaty situation would not necessarily occur, it is currently inappropriate to be overly optimistic. The newspapers also criticized US foreign policy, saying that the US has the power to manipulate the extension of the treaty or impose increased tariffs on Japan after a short notice. The Asahi Shimbun claimed that assurances regarding tariffs and other tax regulations cannot express goodwill, so the general public should not be optimistic about the treaty situation. If a large rift arises in US-Japan relations due to a no-treaty situation, the responsibility must be borne by the United States. The Kokumin Shimbun stated that the US is using the commercial treaty as a weapon to interfere with the Japanese military's resolution of the China Incident and the construction of a "New Order in East Asia," which is extremely obvious. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun today published an article warning its readers that US Ambassador Grew declared during his meeting with Foreign Minister Nomura on December 22nd that before beginning discussions on the commercial treaty issue, he wished to continue considering various matters that could obstruct the resolution of the commercial treaty issue. What the US Ambassador wanted to know was whether Japan would continue to implement exchange restrictions and monopolistic practices after the end of the Sino-Japanese War. The US Ambassador also told Foreign Minister Nomura that the US government wished to obtain assurances from Japan that American residents in China would enjoy the same economic and religious status as the Japanese. The US government also highly values Japan's behavior in respecting the Open Door Policy and equal opportunity in China, the report said. The newspaper also reported that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi proposed to US Secretary of State Hull on December 23rd that a temporary trade agreement be concluded first during the negotiation of the commercial treaty, but the US government suggested imposing a moral prohibition on the export of light metals, gasoline, and machinery to Japan. Therefore, the purpose of the US seems to be to maintain its freedom so that it can cope with Japan at any time by prohibiting exports. The newspaper concluded by saying that the assurances provided by the US regarding tariffs and other tax regulations do not express the spirit of friendship, and the undercurrent of US-Japan relations may not have a gratifying or constructive nature. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Although Japanese officials say that Japan's intention to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is not affected by political relations, Japanese newspapers are becoming increasingly sharp in their comments regarding the US government's disregard of Japan's proposal to immediately negotiate a new commercial treaty or at least temporarily extend the existing commercial treaty. The Kokumin Shimbun stated that Japan's decision to open the Yangtze River despite opposition from all sides is a major sacrifice on Japan's part. US Deputy Ambassador to Japan [illegible] visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on November 26th, and was concerned about the optimistic remarks made by the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Suma, which gave the impression that Japan and the United States had begun negotiations to conclude a new commercial treaty. The US Deputy Counselor pointed out that Suma's statement was completely contrary to the facts and declared that the US felt it necessary to correct the misunderstanding among the public as a result. Observing this kind of interaction by the US Deputy Counselor, it is known that the US-Japan relations on January 26th will definitely enter a state of no treaty, and a certain tax-free treatment enjoyed by Japanese goods will be unilaterally revoked by the United States when it deems appropriate. In this way, the US government's attitude of using the commercial treaty as a tool to interfere with Japan's work to build a "New Order in East Asia" has become clear and undoubtedly. The important significance of opening the Yangtze River has been destroyed by the United States to this point, and the incompetence of Nomura's diplomacy is thus exposed. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When Prime Minister Abe met with reporters today, he admitted that Japan faces many difficulties in concluding a new commercial treaty before the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty on January 26th of next year, but he believed that before the conclusion of a formal new commercial treaty, the US and Japan should be able to establish a temporary solution. He also said that Japan has made preparations for the raw materials necessary for the country, so the US can impose an embargo on Japan without problems. Japan has considered the plan to open the Yangtze River, so this decision has no political significance. Abe also said that he does not want to resign at present and plans to retire after the establishment of the "New Central Government of China." Regarding Japan-Soviet relations, Abe said that the negotiations in Moscow are progressing smoothly, and the Chita border demarcation conference is also progressing smoothly. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Daily News published an editorial yesterday opposing the US government's implementation of a transitional measure after the expiration of the US-Japan commercial treaty, saying that the will of the Japanese military only knows how to stabilize its own strength. We must stop supplying Japan with raw materials until the Japanese government agrees to stop its aggression against China. Otherwise, Japan will use China as a large arsenal and a reservoir of manpower, endangering Western civilization. (United Press Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Datsu: Today, representatives of the American Chamber of Commerce visited General Honma, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, to petition for the cancellation of various restrictions on entry and exit to the Tianjin concession. Since the Japanese blockade of the concession, members of the American business community in Tianjin have experienced various difficulties. The representatives submitted a memorandum to the Japanese commander, stating that for the sake of general trade interests, the obstacles to passage should be removed. If this cannot be implemented, they requested special instructions be given to the guards at each entrance and exit to allow American residents and their families to pass without having to go through inspection points. Lieutenant General Honma replied in a very sincere manner that the cancellation of obstacles would have to await instructions from Tokyo. However, he would pay serious attention to the second request. Honma concluded by saying that the war is still ongoing and advised all parties to be patient. (Reuters Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong: Since the establishment of the Abe Cabinet, it has been a puppet of the military, and it has long been hated by the people of the country. Therefore, the anti-war atmosphere has been spreading recently, and opposition to Abe is fierce within the Diet. On the 27th, 16 Diet members from various factions, including Nakayama Guozhuang, went to Abe's residence to question him, criticizing the communist administration policy and urging him to step down. Abe's face turned red, and he had no words to answer. The Diet members were filled with anger and determined to launch a large-scale movement to overthrow the cabinet. The storm ahead is feared to intensify. (Telegraph, 27th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Before the extraordinary cabinet meeting on the 28th, Prime Minister Abe met with Commerce Minister Godo, Home Minister Obara, and Education Minister Kawarada separately to inquire about the intentions of each minister and exchange opinions regarding the handling of the anti-government resolution submitted by the Association of Diet Members with Aspirations on the 27th. Then, after the cabinet meeting adjourned, he asked all cabinet members to wait in another room, and the Prime Minister reported the beginning and end of the meeting with the representatives of the Association of Diet Members with Aspirations, and inquired about the intentions of each cabinet member. Then, Minister of Colonial Affairs Kanemitsu, Minister of Health Akita, and Minister of Communications Nagata explained the recent situation of the political parties, and held a cordial discussion focusing on this issue. The opinions of the cabinet members were all strongly in favor of the view that the above-mentioned resolution was submitted without going through public institutions such as Diet deliberations or party deliberations, and that the extent to which this issue will affect the entire House of Representatives in the future and how its development will proceed in the future cannot be accurately predicted at present. However, the government is focusing its full efforts on dealing with the incident in order to complete the handling of the incident. At this time, although the Association of Diet Members with Aspirations has criticized the government's domestic administration, this is only a difference in understanding of the handling of the issue. The government will not consider praise or criticism and will always proceed with the handling of the incident in accordance with the root principles at the time of the cabinet formation. The government should, at this time, on the one hand, pay attention to the state of affairs in the House of Representatives, and on the other hand, thoroughly realize the government's intentions, and so on.

<p>Helsinki: Tampere and Turku in southern Finland were bombed by Soviet planes yesterday, with over 50 bombs dropped. However, damage in both locations was minimal. Many bombs dropped in the port of Turku landed in working-class areas, injuring several people, but no fatalities occurred. In Tampere, one person was killed and one injured. Additionally, several other locations were subject to air raids. Simultaneously, Soviet forces continued attacking the left wing of the Mannerheim Line and used heavy artillery along the entire Karelian front. Shells flew over Finnish fortifications and targeted areas behind the front lines. Viipuri suffered the most from this heavy artillery bombardment, estimated to have been fired from a distance of 25 miles. Soviet forces repeatedly attacked the Mannerheim Line, but have so far been unsuccessful. Due to the severe cold, Soviet tanks and artillery units were able to cross frozen lakes and swamps. However, this type of operation must be swift, as troops on the ice are vulnerable to attack. Finnish aircraft constantly monitor the skies, while patrol units stand ready to reinforce threatened areas. Finnish aircraft bombed the ice with accurate drops, discouraging the Soviets from further attempts to cross the ice. Recent news from the Salla front states that ten days ago, Soviet forces advanced nearly halfway through the "waist" before retreating, retreating a total of 50 miles. A recent Finnish communiqué stated that a Soviet attempt to cross Lake Suvanto has been repelled, but a new attempt to cross the lake has now begun, and fighting is ongoing.

In fact, Finnish ski guerrillas have reached the Leningrad-Murmansk Railway in the Soviet Union. According to General Wallenius, "We will not allow the Soviet army a moment's rest or sleep. Most of our weapons are supplied by the Soviets. The weapons used by our soldiers are those captured from the Soviet side. Our best battlefield is in the forest. You cannot see our troops here, but wherever we have just passed, there are 3,000 Finnish soldiers stationed there. In short, there is no place between this position and Kantalahti without Finnish guerrilla units. The Soviet army is constantly being attacked by us." According to Finnish officials, some of the captured weapons are of German manufacture. At the same time, the Salla area, except for the Karelian Isthmus, is the area of ​​greatest Soviet attention. The Soviet forces deployed here number no less than 300,000. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to news received here, Finnish forces launched a counterattack in the area of ​​Salmijärvi in ​​eastern Finland. However, they were unsuccessful due to the intense resistance from the Red Army's numerous tanks, but they still retreated in an orderly manner. Finnish guerrillas in the area were quite successful in attacking the Red Army. A ski unit of 250 soldiers also penetrated into Soviet territory, attempting to disrupt the country's transportation lines, especially the railway lines. In addition, the Red Army in the Karelian Isthmus has now advanced to within 45 kilometers of Viipuri. Its objectives are threefold: (1) Lake Hakiaratti; (2) the town of Suistu (in the Vuoksi River basin); (3) the Taipale River. The Red Army believes that Finnish defenses on Lake Hakiaratti are the weakest, so they launched an attack all day yesterday, but the Finnish army still held the south bank of the lake, unmoved. Several Soviet aircraft bombed a hospital north of Lake Ladoga, ignoring the Red Cross flag clearly displayed on the roof. More than 30 bombs were dropped around the hospital, but fortunately, there was no major damage. The same aircraft also strafed ambulances returning from the front lines with machine guns. Two other Soviet aircraft were forced to land between the towns of Rovaniemi and Kemijärvi yesterday due to mechanical failures. One of them was able to take off again after repairs, and the other has been captured by Finnish forces. According to unconfirmed reports, the Soviet government is dissatisfied with the quality of the ammunition used and is planning to purchase it from Germany. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>London: The British Air Force engaged in very fierce fighting with German aircraft and warships in the North Sea yesterday. British aircraft attacked three German Dornier bombers, disabling them from fighting back, and bombed two German destroyers and four patrol boats. After that, they attacked another seven German patrol boats, at least one of which was hit. All British aircraft and crew returned safely to base. During the engagement, one British aircraft fired its machine gun at one Dornier bomber, scoring several hits. Another British aircraft engaged another Dornier bomber in several passes. The British aircraft dived from above, dropping a bomb, but unfortunately missed by a hair's breadth. Then, a third German bomber flew in to join the battle, coordinating with the second German aircraft, mutually firing their front and rear machine guns in a pincer attack. However, the British gunner was steady and accurate, breaking the pincer attack and causing both German aircraft to be hit and damaged, unable to fight back. Later, the British Air Force attacked German destroyers and patrol boats near the German coast, and attacked another seven German patrol boats near the German naval base. Although the German ships fired heavy anti-aircraft fire, the British aircraft still flew down to attack. One German ship's stern was hit by a bomb and damaged. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris: The weather on the Western Front is cold, with heavy fog and poor visibility, so the entire front is quiet. All aerial activity on both sides has ceased. Only British air force activity has been heard over the North Sea. The most recent land conflict occurred yesterday morning, when German troops attempted to raid a French outpost south of Saarlouis. Since Hitler recently visited Saarlouis, the attack by German troops there was probably ordered by their commander in an attempt to capture some French soldiers and present them to Hitler. If so, the commander was disappointed, as the attacking German troops were driven back after being swept by French fire, leaving the bodies of one officer and two non-commissioned officers on the front lines. A recent French communiqué stated that there has been significant patrol activity between the Moselle and Saar rivers. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters has just issued War Report No. 230, stating, "Our enemy forces have been quite active yesterday between the Moselle and Saar rivers." According to official sources, German infantry suddenly attacked the French outpost south of Saarlouis yesterday morning but were repelled, and one officer and two soldiers were captured. It has since been learned that Head of State Hitler was inspecting the front lines there at the time. In addition, the weather was bad yesterday, and neither side's air force took to the skies.

<p>London: A Reuters special correspondent with the British Expeditionary Force in France reports that India has now stepped into the battlefield of World War II. The first batch of Indian troops has now landed in a port in France. They are all Muslims drawn from various parts of India, accompanied by a number of non-combatants, such as religious teachers, cooks, and sweepers. Indian soldiers are dressed in Indian winter clothing. The British authorities are now providing them with special outerwear. They brought hundreds of millions of boxes of special food and Indian cigarettes. British officers purchased live sheep and other items to supplement the Indian troops' food supply. These animals must be delivered alive to the Indian troops and slaughtered according to their religious customs. The Indian troops will be deployed to the British sector as soon as possible and then divided into small teams stationed in various places. The Indian troops also brought a large number of donkeys to serve as transportation, supplementing the current lack of motorized transport. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris: After several units of Indian troops arrived in France a few days ago, they have already left for the front lines to fight alongside the British Expeditionary Force. It is understood that these units are composed of Muslims from various parts of India. Due to ethnic and religious reasons, the officers and soldiers' food is also transported with them. Their deployment is not yet fully motorized, and transportation still uses mules and horses. (Havas, 28th)</p>

<p>Buenos Aires: After the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" scuttled itself, the ship's officers and men were transported to shore by Argentinian ships and confined by the Argentinian authorities. The German envoy submitted a note on the 23rd of this month, protesting and demanding their release, based on the report passed by the Second Hague International Conference, which stated that combatants in distress should be released after being rescued. The Argentinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently sent a reply to the German embassy, stating that the government believes that the "Admiral Graf Spee" entered Argentinian waters to avoid the continuation of combat with other nations. Therefore, the handling of their landing should be based on the 24th article of the Hague International Convention, which states that troops from combating nations who voluntarily stay within the territorial waters of a neutral nation for longer than the prescribed time will be confined by the nation in question. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Buenos Aires: The Argentinian foreign minister spoke with reporters today, saying that the Argentinian government will not comply with Germany's protest regarding the confinement of the officers and men of the "Admiral Graf Spee."

<p>Paris: The wartime budget for the first quarter of 1940 was recently passed by the Senate with 303 votes, a unanimous vote. Revenue is estimated at 79,246,000,000 francs, and expenditures at 78,919,000,000 francs, resulting in a surplus of 327,000,000 francs. (The original bill passed by the House of Representatives estimated revenue at 79,246,000,000 francs and expenditures at 79,261,000,000 francs, resulting in a deficit of 15,000,000 francs.) Prior to the vote, Gardère, rapporteur of the Finance Committee, stated in a report that France's current financial strength is far greater than it was in 1914. The total budget for the entire year of 1940 will be over 300,000,000,000 francs, and the entire nation should be prepared. In short, even with a sound and effective tax system, the issuance of public bonds is the main method of raising funds during wartime to cope with various expenditures. Although inflation cannot be completely avoided, it should be avoided as much as possible. Finance Minister Reynaud then delivered a speech, saying, "During this period of war, the government will have to requisition all kinds of assets throughout the country, even if they are privately owned. This is already understood by the people of the country and need not be elaborated upon. Moreover, what the state requisitions is not limited to wealth, but also includes all kinds of tools for generating wealth, as well as individuals themselves. As for wartime financial issues, they can generally be divided into two categories: (1) how to raise francs domestically to purchase various necessities, and (2) how to raise foreign exchange to purchase foreign goods. For this reason, all government agencies and the people of the country must strive to economize, increase production, and reduce consumption to replenish the national treasury. If the government agencies need to increase their expenses in the future, then taxes should be increased to make up for it. If military expenses need to be increased, then public bonds should be issued to raise funds. If the Senate agrees with this method, then the government should use it as a basis for preparing budget proposals during the war. In short, although we should try our best to avoid inflation, the French nation needs both food and arms. If we want to prepare properly, then the people's voluntary frugality will inevitably be insufficient. At this point, the world has been divided into two major regions. In the first region, we must use a portion of our gold reserves to purchase goods. In the second region, we can use British pounds to purchase goods. This region is very large and has been opened to us since the financial agreement was concluded between Britain and France on the 4th of this month. This agreement stipulates that the two countries' war expenses should be jointly allocated in a ratio of three to two, British to French. There are some misunderstandings about this point. In fact, since the two countries' living standards are inconsistent, this clause cannot be applied to all war expenses, but only to certain important military expenses that have already been paid, for example, the Polish army's expenses, which are over 3,500,000,000 francs per year. In addition, the financial agreement also applies to British and French aid to Finland. As far as the agreement itself is concerned, its important part lies not in the joint bearing of military expenses, but in the establishment of consultative relations between the two parties on various monetary and economic issues as the foundation for the future restoration of Europe. This is also understood by American public opinion, and the Senate will probably not misunderstand it. As far as the current situation is concerned, the government has no choice but to control foreign exchange, prices, and wages. Once military victory is achieved, freedom can be restored. In other words, our freedom is where our true victory lies. Some say that time is on our side, but I dare say that time is neutral and depends on whether we can use it well," he said.

However, the British and Japanese governments have not yet reached a compromise on this issue. The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun stated, "Everything depends on the British attitude," which is not entirely accurate. The outcome also depends on the opinions of both the Chinese and Japanese governments.

<h3 id="e49">Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Boundaries; Prospects for Negotiations Dim; Disputes Arise over Control of Agencies and Tax Revenue; However, the Situation in the Western District Seems to Be Gradually Easing <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily News" reports that yesterday (the 27th), it was learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and Fu Xiao'an, the "Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality," are currently conducting negotiations on the management of the Western District, based on the joint management plan of the district from 1932. Government officials expressed pessimism yesterday about the success of this plan, but acknowledged that this plan is the only constructive proposal that has been put forward so far and is welcomed by both the Municipal Council and the puppet municipal government, especially the puppet government's insistence on reaching a general agreement around January 1st.</p>
<p>Collection of Puppet Government Levies Likely to Be Delayed—According to responsible sources, the Dadao government has hinted that it has decided to temporarily abandon its previously announced requirement to collect license fees for cars traveling in the Western District, starting from New Year's Day. It is said that the Dadao government may collect license fees fifteen days after issuing a notice at any time. As for the collection of taxes and other items, it is still under consideration. It is said that "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an will postpone making a decision on taxes and other items while continuing to study his recent demands to the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Disputes Re-emerge Between the Two Sides—The 1932 plan for the joint management of the road area outside the boundary stipulated the appointment of one full-time Chinese director and one Western assistant director, but this was not realized. Now, the puppet municipal government and the Municipal Council are reconsidering this plan, but disputes have re-emerged between the two sides regarding the control of the joint agency and the tax revenue collected in the Western District.</p>
<p>The Situation Has Eased in the Last Two Weeks—According to the plan proposed in 1932, the area managed by the joint committee is west of Great Western Road and Yeping Road, and Dadao police have been stationed in this area in recent months. After the Municipal Council directly rejected Fu's demands, it has made significant concessions in the past two weeks, and the attitude of the puppet municipal government has also softened in order to obtain understanding.</p>
<p>Incidents Occur Frequently—The Municipal Council formally announced last month that it did not relinquish its right to collect donations in the Western District and openly opposed the appearance of "Dadao" police on roads built beyond the boundaries. Although the Municipal Council announced that it would maintain police authority in the Western District, several incidents have occurred, such as plainclothes officers snatching handguns from Chinese and Indian constables and injuring foreign police officers, and the perpetrators have apparently not been punished.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Also Insists that the Western District Is an "Occupied Area" and Stations Troops There—As a result, the Municipal Council cannot fully control the area. Moreover, no cooperation has been obtained from the puppet police局 in arresting criminals, cracking down on crimes, gambling dens, drug dealers, and opium dens. According to yesterday's news, the reason why the Municipal Council accepted part of "Mayor" Fu's demands was to eliminate the wave of crime that is spreading from West Shanghai into the Public Concession and becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<h3 id="e50">New Subsidiary Currency Notes Gradually Circulating; Tram Tickets Distribution Limited <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of small denomination currency in Shanghai, various industries faced difficulties. Since the Central Bank continued to issue fractional notes for adjustment, this difficulty has gradually been resolved. Tickets from various industries have gradually disappeared from the market. However, the temporary tickets issued by the tram company and the bus company are still used as usual, circulating on the market for a considerable amount. The companies also recognize that this is a temporary remedy, and have decided to announce a full recall once fractional currency notes are fully in circulation, in order to unify the currency system. Dilapidated tickets will be recalled first, and continued issuance will be limited. Also, the five-cent bus tickets have the usage date printed on the face, stating that they are valid until the end of this month, and holders should pay attention. In addition, after adjustments by the Central Bank, etc., one-yuan notes and dime notes are now sufficient for circulation.</p>
<h3 id="e51">End of Gregorian Calendar Year; Foreign Exchange Rate Stable; Market Passes Through Without Any Problems <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The day after tomorrow is the end of the Gregorian calendar year of the 28th year of the Republic of China. The Bankers' Association and the Money Dealers' Association have decided after consultation that although December 31st is a Sunday holiday, they will still be closed as usual. They will be closed for three days from January 1st and will resume normal business on the 4th. As for the various native banks, because the final accounting has always been at the end of the lunar year, they will only add one settlement at the end of the Gregorian calendar year. Regarding the financial market in Shanghai, after the loan placements by the Four Banks Placement Committee and the adjustments by the Bankers' Association Reserve Fund, although the end of the Gregorian calendar year has arrived, the market remains as stable as a wall. The Shanghai money market's foreign exchange interest rate yesterday still opened at the original price of 1.5 cents. The foreign exchange rate was at its peak of 7 cents before the war, which is sufficient to prove that there is no tension in today's market cash flow. Therefore, there is no problem for various industries to pass through safely. In addition, various industries have also begun to prepare separately for the annual general settlement period for each industry on February 7th.</p>
<h3 id="e52">No Signs of Continued Opening of Municipal Iron Gates; After Restricting Traffic on Xin Kai River, Very Few Residents Enter or Exit <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Since the iron gate at the intersection of the French Concession's Xin Kai River and the Nanshi (Chinese City) was opened on the 11th of this month, the number of residents entering and leaving the passage has suddenly decreased recently due to the sudden restrictions imposed by the Japanese on residents entering and exiting. Ferry boats on the Huangpu River have also reduced their prices due to the lack of passengers. The reporter from the Datong News Agency has recorded the various situations as follows:</p>
<p>Restrictions on Residents Entering and Exiting; Very Few Remaining—Since the Xin Kai River iron gate was relocated to the old site of the Farmers Bank in front of the south end of the Fire Brigade, residents holding "Citizen Certificates" issued in October, November, and December, as well as blue "Passes" from the "Japanese Naval Headquarters" and white "Passes" from the "Japanese Army Headquarters," have all been refused entry and exit by the Japanese side, resulting in a sharp decrease in the number of residents entering the concession from Nanshi or entering Nanshi from the concession in recent days. It is also learned that the Japanese army at Nanmatou in Pudong and other places also impose the same restrictions on the above-mentioned "Citizen Certificates," etc., and many residents are being blocked.</p>
<p>All Other Gates Remain Closed</p>
<p>So far, there are no signs of opening of other iron gates adjacent to Nanshi in the French Concession. According to the reporter from the Datong News Agency's continued visit, the iron gates in the Xiaodongmen, Xiaobeimen, and Nanyang Bridge areas remain closed as before, with dense barbed wire frames on both sides and overgrown weeds. Armed police officers dispatched by the French police station are stationed outside the iron gates, and the situation is extremely desolate.</p>
<p>Ferry Business Declines and Prices Are Reduced</p>
<p>Since the opening of Xin Kai River, the business of ferries on the Huangpu River has plummeted due to the lack of passengers. Recently, because the Japanese army in Nanmatou in Pudong and other places has continued to restrict residents entering and exiting, business has not improved and prices have been reduced. Previously, the fare from Pudong to Nanshi was 7 cents in national currency per person, but it has been reduced to 5 cents or 6 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e53">5,000 New Japanese Soldiers Transferred to Two Routes; Pingwang Road Tracks Not Yet Repaired; Puppet Police on Guard at Suzhou Creek Bridge <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Since the war has entered a new stage, all Japanese troops stationed in the rear have been transferred to the front lines, and guerrilla groups in various places have gradually established contact and launched surprise attacks. The Japanese army is extremely panicked. Recently, 5,000 new soldiers were transferred from Japan, and have already been allocated to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. It has been investigated that most of the new soldiers are conscripts who have not been on the battlefield, and cannot withstand the severe cold, and are extremely fearful of guerrilla attacks. On the 27th of this month, a Japanese soldier resembling an officer was captured by a guerrilla group stationed in a certain place. After interrogation, it was learned that he was a merchant who had lived in Shanghai for a long time, was drafted back to Japan, and then dispatched to China again.</p>
<p>Searches Along the Way—According to transportation industry sources, the tracks and bridges on the two railways have recently been frequently bombed and dismantled. At the end of last month, a bombing occurred at the Zhoujing station. On the 27th of this month, the tracks near Pingwang were also severely damaged, and had not yet been repaired as of yesterday. As a result, passengers and troops are still delayed in arriving. In order to prevent similar incidents from continuing, the Japanese side has intensified its inspection of traveling merchants and tourists in recent days, and there are also Japanese Koreans disguised and mixed in the vehicles, paying attention to the movements of various passengers. From this, we can see the Japanese army's apprehension.</p>
<p>Puppet Police on Guard—Also, because the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai has been transferred to the front lines, the Japanese authorities consider the defense and positions in the Zhabei area to be very important, and have dispatched large teams of puppet police to replace the Japanese army's positions. Only two Japanese soldiers are left at each bridgehead along Suzhou Creek to maintain the facade. The police originally dispatched by the Japanese Consulate have now been completely withdrawn and replaced by puppet police, and the inspection is extremely strict.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economics requires each national product factory to report to the Ministry of Economics Economic Department, (1) All manufacturers who have received a national product certificate should fill in a report form every six months and submit it to the ministry for record. The form is the same as the report form that should be submitted when applying for a national product certificate. (2) The filled report form should be submitted by the local competent authority or directly submitted for verification with certification from a legitimate industrial and commercial organization. The certification procedure should be handled in accordance with the method for filling and submitting the application form for a national product certificate. Now that the second half of this year is coming to an end, each national product factory has filled out the form as required and directly submitted it to the relevant national product organizations for submission to the Ministry of Economics for verification. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had previously been ordered by the Ministry of Economics to create a table every month to report the establishment, closure, reorganization, and other information of Shanghai's industrial and commercial enterprises. It is reported that the association has now temporarily suspended handling this matter.</p>

<p>According to people from Hongkou, starting at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Japanese suddenly dispatched a large number of military police, divided into small teams (five members per team), to conduct inspections of pedestrians and vehicles on Miller Road, Wusong Road, Wuchang Road, Minhang Road, and Kunshan Road. The procedures were quite strict, and even women and children had to undress for inspection. Residents in the alleys and lanes of the above-mentioned places were searched and interrogated by the Japanese several times from the night before last until yesterday. Delays in answering were often met with scolding. The inspection work at the key bridges leading to the central district of the Public Concession, such as Waibaidu Bridge, Zhabu Road Bridge, and North Sichuan Road Bridge, and at the gaps in the barbed wire on Hainaning Road and Wenjianshi Road, has also been intensified, and the situation is quite tense. According to reports, the reason for the Japanese army's search is that a shocking and bloody tragedy occurred in the Japanese defense zone of Hongkou at around 3:40 p.m. the day before yesterday. The victim was a Japanese whose body was dismembered. The matter is bizarre, so the Japanese have dispatched all armed military police to search for the murderer. However, the details are unknown.

<h3 id="e57">Rice Merchants Exceeding Price Limits Will Be Publicly Prosecuted by the Court; Manipulating Wartime Food Supplies Should Be Severely Punished <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>After the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the French Concession's Public Works Bureau stipulated and strictly enforced rice price limits, three brokers, Yang Xihuang, Huang Renjie, and Huang Renjie, and Xi Yigu of Quanyi Rice Store, who exceeded the price limits for buying and selling, were not only revoked of their tea house market entry permits and prohibited from entering the market for business, but also severely reprimanded. After receiving the report, the First Special District Court dispatched police to investigate thoroughly yesterday. The three people who exceeded the price limits will be publicly prosecuted and punished appropriately in accordance with the law for manipulating food supplies during wartime. At the same time, the authorities will also carefully formulate methods to sanction the few rice merchants who use the highest selling price of rice to determine prices and arbitrarily raise or lower them in secret, thereby raising the highest selling price of white rice.</p>
<p>Inviting Various Industries to Solicit Foundation Funds—The total amount of the foundation for ordering foreign rice is 1 million yuan in national currency. The amount that various industries have recognized is 520,000 yuan. In order to reach the full amount as soon as possible, it has been decided to invite various industries that have not yet recognized the funds to a meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 12 noon today. Regarding the registration for ordering foreign rice, there were a total of 91 registrations yesterday.</p>
<p>Bankers and Money Dealers Respond to Ordering Rice—The Bankers' Association and the Money Dealers' Association have requested the Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association to advance funds for ordering foreign rice. They have convened a meeting of all member banks and native banks and unanimously approved the advancement of funds for ordering rice to transport it to Shanghai to adjust the food supply. The Shanghai Bankers and Money Dealers Consumer Cooperative has stipulated the following methods for group registration for ordering foreign rice: (1) In response to the Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association's method for ordering foreign rice on behalf of others, this cooperative is specifically seeking registration from colleagues in the banking and money dealing industry in order to jointly register with the association as a group. (2) Banks, native banks, or colleagues who wish to entrust the cooperative to order foreign rice on their behalf can obtain an application form from the cooperative, fill it out according to the format, and have it signed and sealed by the person in charge, the cooperative's sales representative, or the Shanghai Banking and Money Dealers Friendship Association's liaison officer. (3) When registering, registrants should pay 20 yuan per bag in national currency to the cooperative, and the cooperative will issue a receipt as proof. (4) The minimum amount to be ordered per unit or per person is one bag. The cooperative will accumulate the number of bags ordered by the registrants to a considerable amount and then proceed to handle the group registration procedures with the association. (5) Once a registrant has ordered rice, they may not cancel or reduce the amount they have already ordered. (6) After the registration has accumulated to a considerable amount, the association will investigate the market price and water fee for foreign rice and decide to order it from abroad. (7) When foreign rice is ordered, the registrants will be notified on the day after the settlement exchange rate is determined. After the foreign rice arrives in Shanghai, the registrants will be notified to pay the full amount for the rice. (8) Registrants of this cooperative may entrust the cooperative to handle transportation matters if necessary. (9) Matters not covered in these measures will be handled in accordance with the measures of the Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Promotes Fundraising—The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Rice Store Industry Association, and the Trade Association discussed raising funds the day before yesterday to order a large quantity of Saigon foreign rice. The Grain, Oil, and Oil Cake Industry Association will also convene a committee meeting tomorrow afternoon to establish a fundraising and solicitation committee with the aim of raising 100,000 yuan in national currency. The Bean and Rice Industry's Fundraising and Solicitation Committee has scheduled a joint meeting with the Grain, Oil, and Oil Cake Industry Association's Fundraising Committee for 3 p.m. today. All committee members will attend on time to discuss the steps to be taken to raise funds. The Market Management Committee convened an adjustment committee at the Market Public Sample Office at 11 a.m. yesterday to mediate disputes among colleagues.</p>
<p>Motives for Selling Rice in West Shanghai—The "Continental Daily News" reports that the Japanese authorities opened a rice store three weeks ago on Pingyuan Road, west of Yidingpan Road, named "Dongxing Company," selling Xian rice to coolies at a price of 30 yuan per dan. Yesterday, the Chinese business community expressed great doubt about the motives of the Japanese side. It is said that the opening of Dongxing Company has a damaging impact on the rice industry in the area, because legitimate rice merchants cannot purchase rice at a price lower than Dongxing Company's selling price for sale. Therefore, many rice stores in the area have closed down, and those that continue to operate have very little business. A merchant commented on Dongxing Company's selling price, saying that it is not surprising that the company's selling price is low, but it would be surprising if it did not set an even lower price, because the Japanese can obtain a dan of rice from rice-producing areas at a low price of 15 yuan. As for the cost of transporting rice to the Shanghai market, it certainly does not cost 15 yuan per dan. Since Dongxing Company opened, there has been a Japanese "manager" who goes to the store every day to issue rice purchase tickets in a small office. According to one of the clerks, the company sells rice in small quantities by measure. The reporter visited the area yesterday and saw dozens of men and women crowded at the entrance of Dongxing Company, waiting to receive rice purchase tickets. Many of them waited for a long time without success and returned empty-handed.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Public Concession Fires Break Record in One Year; Totaling 1,100 Incidents Throughout the Year; Buildings Are Particularly Unstable and Highly Flammable <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that the head of the Shanghai Fire Brigade told reporters yesterday (the 27th) that in the past year, the Fire Brigade had fought a total of 1,100 fires in the Public Concession and several areas outside the boundary, which is a record-breaking number. This indicates a trend in the Chinese construction industry of building unstable and highly flammable buildings. This number was 1,099 before yesterday morning, but yesterday morning, a ship was not careful with fire and destroyed eight bales of cotton, bringing the total number of fires since January 1st of this year to 1,100. The number of fires recorded in previous years has been increasing year by year, but not as much as this year. The reason why the records of previous years have been broken year by year is due to the increase in population in the Public Concession. The Western District, with its many major fires, is the most prominent. Unstable and flammable buildings will quickly spread after a fire, endangering nearby buildings. The Public Concession has an effective Fire Brigade, so the number of fires has not exceeded the current figure. The increase in the total number of fires over the past 39 years is quite alarming. In 1900, there were only 119 fires in the Public Concession and the French Concession. In 1907, the French Concession organized its own Fire Brigade, so the number decreased slightly. In 1910, there were only 115 fires. Five years later, the number had doubled. After that, it gradually increased to 315 in 1920, 574 in 1925, 906 in 1937, and 1,056 in 1938. This year, it will exceed 1,100. Most of these are fires in straw huts and small shops and factories built of flammable materials, and most are in the Western District. These houses are often built of flammable wooden boards or are simply straw huts, which are easy to catch fire and quickly spread. Because the location of these straw huts is often surrounded by residences and shops, with only one or two narrow paths leading to them, there are almost always casualties after a fire. This kind of flammable building is a serious danger to life. There are always places where fires start, but there is no one responsible for effectively dealing with this matter and restricting the construction of such dangerous buildings. Another factor in the increase in fires is that many Chinese small factories disregard the use of highly dangerous materials in the manufacture of goods. For example, manufacturers of iron beds do not know how dangerous the starch they use is. As a result, a fire broke out in an iron bed store on Edward Road, killing ten people in minutes. Another dangerous and highly flammable material is celluloid. There are hundreds of small Chinese factories that manufacture celluloid products. Once they are careless with fire, it is difficult to extinguish. As a result of carelessness in small celluloid factories, more than 2,000 people have lost their lives and twice as many have been injured. The deputy director of the Fire Brigade recounted the organizational overview of the Municipal Council's Fire Brigade, saying that whenever the central management office at the Fire Brigade headquarters on Henan Road receives a fire report, it immediately instructs the nearest Fire Brigade to dispatch two fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. The Fire Brigade has six stations: Central, Jing'an Temple, Xinzha, Yichang Road, Yangshupu, and Hongkou. Upon receiving a report, it immediately dispatches two fire engines to fight the fire. However, if firefighters on the watchtower see smoke or flames, they dispatch three fire engines. Also, if the fire is very fierce, another nearby Fire Brigade will dispatch two fire engines to assist. Therefore, when a straw hut catches fire in the Western District, there are always three fire engines from the Jing'an Temple Road Fire Brigade and two fire engines from the Yichang Road Fire Brigade working together to put out the fire.</p>

<p>Wang Amao, a 15-year-old girl from Suzhou, lived with her mother, Wu Li, in their hometown. In July of this year (lunar calendar), a fellow villager named Lu Ruming, seeing Wang's youth and beauty, harbored wicked intentions. He enticed her with sweet words, saying how developed the dance industry was in Shanghai and how one could earn hundreds of gold coins per month. If Wang would go with him to Shanghai to learn dancing, her future income would be considerable. Wang Li was deceived by his</p>
<p>Sweet Talk, and instructed Amao to go to Shanghai with Lu on July 13th. It turns out that Lu Ruming was not a good person. He and his wife, Chen, ran a high-class brothel at 180 Gu Ling Road, harboring many prostitutes and engaging in prostitution. After Wang arrived in Shanghai, she was forced into prostitution, renamed Wang Meiyun, and forced to live the life of a prostitute. Her first act of prostitution was on October 20th in room 609 of the Great Eastern Hotel, when a customer surnamed Chen</p>
<p>Destroyed her Chastity. The price was 500 yuan. Afterwards, another prostitute, Lu Yinge (16 years old), accompanied her to various hotels to serve customers. All the money earned from the nightly services went to Lu Ruming and his wife. Wang had no power to resist after entering the cage. It wasn't until the 26th of last month that she met her aunt, Bi Shen, near Ni Cheng Bridge, and told her everything. Bi Shen then quietly reported to the Women's Relief Association, who after investigation, found it to be true. The day before yesterday, the Relief Association's representative, female lawyer Tu Kunfan, reported to the New Gate Police Station, who sent Chinese detective He Wenying to arrest Lu Chen (Lu Ruming is on the run), along with Wang Amao, also known as Meiyun, and</p>
<p>Took them to the Police Station. Chen was ordered to be detained and was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted according to the law and presented the case. After Judge Xiao Xiexun interrogated them, he ordered Lu Chen to be detained pending further investigation. Wang was taken back by her aunt, Bi Shen.</p>

<p>Although the weather in Shanghai has not been extremely cold, the temperature in the early morning often hovers below 0 degrees Celsius, causing the deaths of homeless beggars to continue unabated. The work of collecting the bodies by various charitable organizations remains extremely busy. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired at the Observatory, the lowest temperature in Shanghai at 5 AM yesterday morning was 1.1 degrees Celsius below zero, or 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Although there was no ice, the frost was extremely heavy. The northerly wind was biting, making people shiver with cold. Many beggars sleeping on the streets still froze to death, a pitiful sight. It is reported that on the 27th of this month, the Pu Shan Villa collected a total of 17 bodies of frozen-to-death refugees and beggars from the roads and alleys. Yesterday (28th), another 18 bodies of frozen-to-death beggars, large and small, were collected, totaling 35. Including the 24th, 25th, and 26th, the total number of frozen-to-death bodies discovered in the past five days has reached 102. According to the Observatory, the weather has not been extremely cold recently, and the temperatures in various parts of China are currently stable. In this severe winter season, the cold days are still long. The fate of the beggars wandering the streets and alleys and the refugees huddled in thatched sheds is far from over. It is hoped that members of society will find ways to rescue them.</p>

<p>Zheng Zhou, a woman from Ningbo, lived at No. 5 Triangle Street, west of Nine Acres in the Chinese district, at the age of 44 in 1937. Her married daughter, Chen, lived at No. 3 next door. In mid-November of that year, Zhou went to serve her daughter during childbirth. However, at 3 AM on the night of the 23rd of the same month, her son-in-law, Yuan Fangxing (25 years old this year, also from Ningbo), suddenly attacked Zhou's head with a firewood axe, striking her three times. Yuan then fled. Later, because the area had been designated as a refugee zone, Father Rao, the director of the refugee zone, reported the incident to the French Concession Police. Zhou was sent to Guangci Hospital, where she died despite medical treatment. The deceased's daughter did not wait for the police to report the verification and immediately had the coffin prepared and placed at the Siming Guildhall. Later, after the French Concession Police received a report from the hospital, they transported the coffin to the autopsy room and reported to the Second Special Court for personnel to examine the body and await the arrest of the murderer. Two years have passed since this incident occurred. The deceased's two sons and the murderer were close relatives, and because so much time has passed, they were unwilling to pursue the matter. Therefore, the two families continued to interact as usual, and the homicide case was treated as closed. However, the day before yesterday, the murderer Yuan Caixing and the deceased's son, the two brothers-in-law, took the opportunity to watch a movie in the British Concession and then went to a tavern to drink together. They suddenly became drunk and argued over a minor matter, resorting to violence. The patrolmen arrived and arrested both parties, taking them to the police station for questioning. It was discovered that Yuan had killed his mother-in-law, a serious case. The French Concession Police were notified to send detectives to take Yuan back into custody. He was sent to the Second Special Court yesterday and requested to be detained for investigation and prosecution at a later date. Judge Sun Pengxian questioned the defendant in the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendant to be detained and interrogated again on January 19, 1940.</p>

<p>Recently, thieves impersonating dance guests have frequently infiltrated various dance halls in the city, resulting in daily reports of stolen coats and handbags. A few days ago, a female guest at the Daxin Dance Hall had her long-haired camel hair coat, worth 835 yuan, stolen from her seat. Fortunately, the theft was discovered and solved at that time. The day before yesterday, a similar case occurred at the Yunnan Road Yangtze Dance Hall. Ke Xiuzhen, a woman residing at No. 7 Jiaqing Fang, Maiqi Road, went to the Yangtze Dance Hall with her sister Lu Agen at 3:30 PM to dance, wearing a gray coat worth 835 yuan. After finding a seat, Ke took off her coat and placed it on the back of the chair. At this time, Wang Shunjie, a Shanghainese man sitting next to her, was a thief. Seeing that the opportunity had arrived, he stole Ke's gray coat and fled. Unexpectedly, he was seen by He Lianjun, a tea boy at the dance hall, who immediately apprehended him. Wang Gang and a woman named Li Lingling, who were sitting with Wang, left in the confusion. Only a man named Yu Yuan was detained as well. Chinese detective Cao Qishan arrived and took Wang and Yu to the Lao Zha Police Station. They were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that there have been many similar cases recently, so it is necessary to investigate whether the defendants have committed similar crimes. He requested a postponement for further interrogation. After Judge Meng Tingke questioned them, he ordered them to be detained and interrogated again at a later date.</p>

<p>At 8:45 PM the other night, a black car, No. 1357, suddenly arrived on Huanlong Road in the French Concession, stopping in front of a certain house. A man in the car broke free and escaped. A brief account has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the French Concession Police have found clues to the case, but it has not yet reached the stage of public announcement, so it is impossible to find out. It is only heard that the kidnapped persons were surnamed Su and Wang, and the man who broke free on the spot was surnamed Zhu, who works in a labor union.

According to the accusation, at 10 PM on the night of the 15th of this month, the plaintiff had already gone to bed when the defendant arrived at the plaintiff's residence and suddenly argued with the plaintiff's husband, Yang Yongnian, and then resorted to violence. The plaintiff got up to dissuade them, but the defendant turned his anger on the plaintiff, ignoring that she was six months pregnant, and kicked her abdomen with his foot before fleeing. That night, the plaintiff had abdominal pain and suffered a miscarriage, losing consciousness. She was taken to Guangren Hospital on Aiwenyi Road for treatment. The hospital reported the case of assault and abortion to the New Gate Police Station, who then reported it to the French Concession Police. The plaintiff is now filing a lawsuit with the court and requesting an examination of the injuries. She is requesting that the defendant be arrested and punished according to the law. Upon receiving the lawsuit, Judge Liao of the First Criminal Court summoned them for questioning. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. The plaintiff stated the above events. The defendant denied the accusations. The court reviewed the statements and ordered a postponement for further interrogation. The defendant was released on bail.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Rice Merchant Exploits the Common People: Rice Shop Owner Arrested <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of rice in Shanghai has risen, affecting the lives of ordinary people, although the authorities of the two concessions have lowered the price, it is difficult to expect it to fall back in the short term. At this time, the Guanghua Rice Shop at No. 30 Caishi Road was found to be padding the rice measuring cups with horse manure paper to exploit the common people. After being reported, the police arrested the shop owner, Yin Shangbin, and sent him to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to the law. As a result, he was fined 300 yuan. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. Now, one month later, the Yongkang Rice Shop at No. 241 Min Tini Yin Road (at the intersection of Aileige Road) was found to have recently hollowed out the iron weights of the scales to reduce the weight and exploit customers. The other day, Lin Zhiyun, who lives at No. 20, Yuqing Li, outside Xiaobeimen, bought five dou of rice from the Yongkang shop. When he weighed it at home with a market scale, it was only 75 jin. According to market regulations, it was 5 jin short. He negotiated with the shop, and the secret was revealed. Lin reported it to the police, who arrested the shop owner, Xiang Fukang (25 years old, from Liudong), and took him to the police station. He was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case and prosecuted according to the law, requesting severe punishment to warn unscrupulous merchants. During the interrogation, Xiang confessed that the iron weights of the scale were old, damaged, and discarded and had not been used for a long time. He claimed that his partner had mistakenly used them and asked for leniency. Judge Qiu reviewed the confession and rebuked the defendant, stating that merchants should abide by ethics and should not engage in such unscrupulous exploitation at a time when the rice situation in Shanghai is extremely precarious. After finishing his remarks, he announced the conclusion of the trial and set the sentencing for the 30th. The defendant was released on 500 yuan bail; without bail, he was detained.</p>

<p>Xu Xinshou, a cobbler residing at No. 177 Lao Jie, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou, had an affair with a woman surnamed so-and-so who lived in his attic. Recently, due to a disagreement, they broke off contact. At about 2 AM on the 24th of this month, five bandits suddenly came to the woman's home, each wielding a sharp weapon, tied her up, and robbed her of clothing and jewelry worth 142 yuan before fleeing. The victim reported the incident to the police and requested an arrest. By 2 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese detectives Wang Qishan and Sun Guanhua of the New Gate Police Station had arrested four bandits, Wang Haisheng, Zhuang Genfu, Yu Jisheng, and Jiang Amao, at the intersection of Aiwenyi Road and Yu Qiaqing Road. Two knives were found on Wang, a flashlight was found on Jiang, and a robe and jacket worn by Yu Jisheng were original stolen items belonging to the victim. They also confessed that Xu Xinshou had instigated the robbery. The detectives then arrested Xu and took him to the police station.

<p>Xu Yiqin, also known as Xinmin, a 30-year-old man from Yantai who was the deputy director of the business department of the Tianjin Commercial Bank in the French Concession of Tianjin, took advantage of his position last month to privately withdraw 45,000 French francs from the bank and exchanged them for 3,200 US dollars. He then fled to Shanghai with Rong Ruizhen (17 years old), a prostitute from Suzhou, from room 51 of the Guomin Hotel, aboard the Taikoo Company's Hubei steamer. After the bank discovered the incident, it reported it to the local French Concession Police and telegraphed the Shanghai French Concession Police to send detectives to wait at the wharf. When the Hubei steamer arrived at the port, they boarded the ship and intercepted Xu and the prostitute Rong, confiscated the stolen US dollars, and took them back to the police station. They telegraphed the Tianjin French Concession Police, and Lu Xinshang, the manager of the Tianjin Commercial Bank, came to Shanghai to file a lawsuit with the French Concession Police. The French Concession Police sent Xu and Rong to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Miao Qingbang opened the court for continued trial. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution for embezzlement and detailed the investigation. Then, the plaintiff Lu Xinshang described the discovery of the defendant's embezzlement, fleeing, reporting to the police, and interception. He also requested the return of the stolen money. When questioned, Xu confessed without denial. The court reviewed the statements. As this case involves jurisdictional issues, it was ordered to wait for submission to the High Branch Court to be forwarded to the Supreme Court for designation of jurisdiction before further interrogation. The defendant Xu Yiqin was returned to custody, and Rong Ruizhen was allowed bail. The plaintiff was also instructed to find a proper guarantor to come forward, and the stolen money was allowed to be returned.</p>

<p>The annual handicap billiards tournament for members of the Hong Kong Road Banking Club, with a total of thirty-four members participating, has been underway since the 20th of last month. The two finalists were Ding Mingyi and Zhao Peirong. Due to the handicap system, strong players such as Fang Yide, Hu Changyuan, and Bao Qiyun had already been defeated by Ding and Zhao. The finals were held at the club on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 27th) at 5:30 PM, with a large audience in attendance. Hu Yunji served as the referee. Ding Mingyi, steady and experienced, has been through many battles, but his luck was not on his side that night. Zhao Peirong took the lead from the start. Zhao scored thirty-three points while Ding only had thirteen. When Zhao reached ninety-one points, Ding caught up to one hundred and nine points. However, it was only a fleeting moment, as he didn't achieve any more high scores. Therefore, when Zhao reached the final score of two hundred and twenty points on his thirty-seventh shot, Ding was only at two hundred and thirty-one points, not even halfway to the required five hundred points. Only on his eleventh shot did he achieve a single-shot score of forty-two points, the highest record of the game. Zhao seemed to have divine assistance, with every break and pocket shot hitting the mark. He averaged six points per shot, and the game ended in just one hour, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Grain: Rice Enters the Concession via Hongkou; Approximately Five Thousand Bags of Japonica and Indica Rice; Rice Prices Show Signs of Fluctuations; Regular Japonica Rice Still Only Showing Medium Grade Samples <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The long-severed source from the interior is now controlled by them in Hongkou. After more than a thousand bags were transferred from the Hongkou district the day before yesterday, it was also heard yesterday that early and late rice from around Huangqiao and Nan'gang, near Tuanlai Temple, was loaded onto twenty-five or six river sailboats and tugboats, first arriving in Hongkou and then being transported to the concession by truck from that district. Estimating around two hundred bags per boat, there were no fewer than five thousand bags. Foreign rice also continued to arrive, one to two hundred thousand bags. If the source continues uninterrupted, the city's food supply can be assured. However, after this series of transfers, it is unknown how much the price will increase. Yesterday, various goods on the market showed more samples. Moreover, as it is the end of the year and the period for major settlements, general merchants are seeking to activate their capital, intending to quickly sell off goods. Consequently, sales were brisk. General customers are also getting by for the end of the year. Except for necessary purchases, they are mostly watching and waiting. The market situation is showing an oversupply, so sellers have no choice but to offer discounts. However, as soon as the trend of falling prices begins, it feels even weaker. Market prices are falling section by section, deeper and deeper, but transactions are still only small and sporadic, with no bulk sales. Statistics show that the total number of city transactions is no more than four or five thousand bags. If not limited, the prices of various goods such as foreign rice and Lu Yang Jian Bian Wu are all lower than the previous market by seven or eight jiao, or nearly a yuan. Those with limited, thick, and thin Japonica rice, according to the quality of the goods, have also been significantly lower, with fluctuations of six or seven jiao. Lower bids have even been reduced by a yuan or more. The quoted prices include: regular state-produced medium Japonica rice at forty yuan, Kunshan and Su Tong white Japonica rice at forty yuan, and the special grade of thin rice Qing Si also at forty yuan. Feng Jia thin rice is around thirty-nine yuan. Early and late rice from Nan'gang is only offered at thirty-eight yuan and seven jiao, and river goods have even dropped to thirty-seven yuan to thirty-six yuan and seven or eight jiao. Although the special grade of regular state-produced Bian Yuan has been quoted at forty-three yuan, no transactions have been seen. Only the medium grade Danyang and Jiangbei white Yuan are offered at forty-one yuan, down to thirty-eight or thirty-nine yuan. Hong Kong Tuan Glutinous rice is also only offered at forty yuan and five jiao, and long-grain at forty yuan and two or three jiao. Except for the special grade of Lu Jian, which is still offered at thirty-nine yuan and a half, most goods in the general market are no more than thirty-nine yuan, thirty-eight yuan and seven or eight jiao. Saigon foreign rice Tuan grain closed at thirty-seven yuan and a half, long-grain at thirty-seven yuan and three jiao, and broken rice at thirty-three yuan and two jiao, ultimately dropping to thirty-two yuan. Siamese Jian is at thirty-seven yuan and eight jiao, and Tokyo Po Jian special grade is at thirty-five yuan. Medium market goods are at thirty-four yuan and three or five jiao.</p>
<p>The Indica rice market is becoming increasingly deserted. Because transportation from the production area is difficult to facilitate, the small number of new arrivals are unwilling to sell cheaply due to the high cost. Although the market has a medium-grade, limited price of thirty-three yuan, high-quality goods are not sold because the cost is thirty-five or thirty-six yuan. Only a few dozen to a hundred bags are traded daily.</p>
<p>In addition to the new arrival of seventy to eighty thousand bags of foreign rice, two or three ships are expected to arrive in port within days. Fixed orders also include broken Saigon and fire-patterned rice, which have been agreed upon in succession. Yesterday, new transactions for broken rice totaled more than four thousand five hundred tons, with prices ranging from thirty-four yuan and four or five jiao to thirty-four yuan and nine jiao and a half. Due to the shrinkage of the exchange rate, the batch is relatively expensive, but the return of local goods has also loosened. The initial offer for Saigon Suzhou wheeled goods in the original package was forty-six yuan, and another batch was forty-five yuan and six jiao. Spot goods are at thirty-eight yuan to thirty-seven yuan and a half, which is about half a yuan lower than the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>Due to the approaching Gregorian New Year, various flour mills intend to settle accounts slightly and wait for January before resuming sales. In recent days, customer sales have gradually shown momentum. In addition to Hong Kong merchants adding to their stocks, North China merchants have also been active. It is heard that the No. 4 flour Red God has opened more than 20,000 bags, an increase of five fen compared to before. Due to factory restrictions, the No. 2 flour is unwilling to supply, so transactions are also rare. Only a few returned goods warehouses supply it, and the price is also quietly active by five fen to one jiao. The official factory price for No. 2 flour is still eight yuan and seven jiao. The street's annual flood needs are also good, with transactions of 13,000 to 14,000 bags. Today, 5,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin and 7,000 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat transactions continue to be clear. Due to the approaching Gregorian New Year, merchants do not want to sell urgently, and factories also dislike the high price and have no intention of buying. As a result, Fuxin Factory stopped operations, and Xintuan households watched and waited. Only Fufeng Factory handled more than 1,000 bags alone. The highest price is still fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Rises Again by Two or Three Yuan <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Although there are no large transactions in the peanut oil and soybean oil markets, due to environmental factors, prices are rising with the tide, and the base is firm. Therefore, it is easy for prices to rise but difficult to fall. Yesterday, various oil prices on the market rose again by two or three yuan. Transactions included 1,500 cans of Jiangbei Tingxiao raw oil, priced at 100 yuan, and 30 barrels, priced at 98 yuan. 20 barrels of Qingdao barrel raw oil were priced at 102 yuan, and 200 cans of Yantai Ting raw oil were priced at 99 yuan. 50 dan of local factory soybean oil were priced at 86 yuan, and 30 barrels from Changzhou were priced at 109 yuan and 108 yuan and five jiao. 20 barrels of Jiangbei barrel soybean oil were priced at 109 yuan and five jiao, and 30 barrels of Qingdao barrel soybean oil were priced at 109 yuan to 108 yuan. The destination, except for Jiangbei Ting raw oil, which was purchased by Hong Kong merchants, the rest was destined for this street.</p>
<p>Imports of raw oil amounted to 597 cans from Qingdao. On the 29th, 4,727 bags of soybeans, 1,390 bags of raw peanuts, and 5,085 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Finance: Hong Kong Merchants Continue to Dump Foreign Exchange; Sassoon Issues Near-Term and Buys Long-Term <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listings remain unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates continued to harden. This was due to the continued dumping of large quantities by Hong Kong banks. However, Sassoon sold near-term and bought long-term, with the current interest rate at 0.0625 shillings, equivalent to about 1.3% per month. These were all purchased by banks with favorable terms such as HSBC and Datong. Throughout the day, the morning opening showed a slight hardening of the US dollar, while the British pound was still flat, at 1.25 and 7.9375. Then, because HSBC was willing to absorb and Sassoon and Hong Kong speculators also bought into long-term shillings, the loosening stopped and stabilized. At that time, the selling price was 4 pence 78125 and 7.875. At noon, Sassoon sold near-term and bought long-term, and the situation was generally stable. By the close, it was 4 pence 8125 and 7.90625. Transactions in the afternoon suddenly cleared, with only foreign firms buying in slightly. The market trend was slightly tighter in a quiet manner. As a result, the evening close was 4 pence 78125 and 7.84375, a loosening of 0.03125 and 0.0625 compared to the previous day. Due to the large number of buyers, the futures potential slightly widened.</p>
<p>Swap Spreads Slightly Wider</p>
<p>Initially, London's big news caused both near-term and long-term interest rates to shrink sharply by 8125. New York silver prices did not change, and London gold prices remained stable. The exchange rates for the British pound against the US dollar and the French franc were flat, while the rate against Shanghai rose by 125. The exchange rates for the US dollar against the British, Shanghai, and French francs were all flat. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening selling price for spot loans was 4 pence 75 for the British pound and 7 yuan 8125 for the US dollar, compared to the previous closing, the British pound was flat and the US dollar loosened by 0.03125. After the opening, Hong Kong banks first sold out, and the market immediately became tighter. It is estimated that spot goods were sold to foreign banks such as Youli at 4 pence 765625 and 78125 for the British pound, and then to export merchants such as Datong for spot US dollars at 7 yuan 84375 and 875. When HSBC's listings were announced unchanged and the silver balance tax was announced to have plummeted by 4.25 points, Hong Kong banks continued to sell, and Chinese banks also followed suit slightly, so the market continued to harden. It is estimated that Hong Kong banks and Chinese banks sold spot British pounds to foreign banks such as HSBC at 4 pence 8125, and spot US dollars at 7 yuan 90625 and 9375. At that time, a group of Hong Kong speculators suddenly called to buy British pounds for January, and Western merchant Sassoon also absorbed long-term contracts, so the loosening trend stopped. It is estimated that Hong Kong speculators and Sassoon successively bought British pounds for January at 4 pence 75 from foreign banks such as HSBC. Soon, Hong Kong speculators called again to buy British pounds for January from Youli, still at 4 pence 75. The situation once softened slightly. The bank was still willing to supply spot prices at 4 pence 78125 and 7 yuan 875. Near noon, Sassoon came to buy long-term contracts again, but at the same time sold near-term contracts. It is estimated that spot British pounds were sold to foreign banks such as Youli and Datong at 4 pence 8125, and January British pounds were bought at 4 pence 75. The current interest rate is estimated to be 0.0625 shillings, equivalent to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of about 1.3%. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot buying price was 4 pence 825 for the British pound and 7 yuan 90625 for the US dollar, compared to the morning opening, the British pound loosened by 0.0625 and the US dollar hardened by 0.09375.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market is Flat</p>
<p>After the market opened, transactions suddenly became rare and the market was quiet. However, the Jinan trend tightened slightly due to some foreign firms buying in. It is estimated that the spot US dollar was sold to a Datong bank at 7 yuan 875 and 84375. After entering a state of calm, the market closed. The bank's spot selling price was 4 pence 78125 for the British pound and 7 yuan 84375 for the US dollar. The next month's price for British pounds was 4 pence 71875 and for the US dollar it was 7 yuan 6875. As a result, compared to the previous day, spot British pounds loosened by 0.03125, spot US dollars hardened by 0.0625, and futures British pounds were unchanged, while futures US dollars loosened by 0.03125.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Gold Market Difficult to Save; Has Reached Small Four Days <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash smelting red black market situation saw mediocre ups and downs, but the weakness was still difficult to reverse, having retreated into the 4,100 yuan range. This was due to the continued loosening of foreign exchange and the unhealthy appetite of Hong Kong merchants. Later, due to the renewed softening of foreign exchange, it slightly turned around, but the result was still a small fourteen yuan. As for the daily passage, the morning opening was fatigued and fell to 4,085 yuan, a decrease of 24 yuan. This was because the exchange market was reported to be loose. Then, the money exchange merchants competed to sell, and the price dropped to a low of 4,073 yuan. Then, because the exchange market turned soft again and the Hong Kong merchants' appetite had improved, it once pulled up to 4,097 yuan. However, the foreign exchange market soon resumed its loosening trend, the selling wind rose again, and the securities merchants were eager to sell. Until the noon closing, there was only a call of 4,078 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation turned slightly, and the result closed at 4,095 yuan. This was due to the soft exchange rate and the strong absorption by a certain bank. The entire day's transactions were 1,700 to 1,800 taels. The price of gold ornaments from silver houses remained unchanged, and Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Since the initial opening of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, the foreign exchange market continued to report hardening, and people's spirits were even more sluggish. Money changers sold at a price, and the market opened with a decrease of 24 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to gold shops, at 4,085 yuan. Shortly after, a certain money changer bought more than a hundred taels at a cheap price on behalf of a customer, which pulled it up by eight yuan. The investment bank bought 50 taels, at 4,0931 yuan. After this, the exchange market continued to loosen and the wind of recovery rose again. A certain bank and silver investors competed to sell, and although a certain gold shop absorbed on behalf of customers, the amount was not large. Soon after, it dropped again by 20 yuan. Money changers sold ten taels to gold shops, at 4,073 yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange stopped loosening and stabilized, buyers took advantage of the cheap price to pull in, and then Hong Kong merchants' appetite turned active again, and they commissioned money changers and a certain silver house to buy on their behalf, causing it to pull up by 24 yuan. Money changers sold 20 taels to securities investors, at 4,097 yuan. At that time, although Hong Kong merchants stopped investing, securities investors still had an appetite, and the foreign exchange slightly tightened, so it was still able to stabilize. However, the exchange market soon loosened again, and another securities investor suddenly started a selling wind, and at the same time, silver houses and gold shops also sold off, and it could not withstand the decline, falling by 20 yuan. Securities investors sold ten taels to money changers, at 4,077 yuan. Following this, gold shops did 20 taels with each other, at 4,078 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the initial opening immediately rose by two yuan. Cash gold shops sold 20 taels to gold shops, at 4,080 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange market softened again, and a certain bank converted more than 200 taels on behalf of customers, and then rose again by 15 yuan. A certain bank and money changers each sold ten taels to gold shops, at 4,095 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it was 14 yuan less than the previous day. It has been falling for four consecutive days, with a total drop of 65 yuan. The price fluctuated by only 24 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of cash gold shops' own brand of gold was several yuan higher than the smelting red price, and the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current price of standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>The price of gold ornaments remains unchanged</p>
<p>The price of silver house gold ornaments per tael has not changed all day. Datong's price remains at 415 yuan, the same as the price of Xin's stores. The buying price is about 15 yuan less.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the supply and demand of British and American gold pounds were equal, and the market was stable. British and American gold notes initially loosened due to abundant supply, with the former falling to 45 yuan and 8 jiao and the latter to 12 yuan 7 jiao 8 fen. The latter was firm due to strong demand. In the evening market, British notes rose to 46 yuan and American notes rose to 12 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen. As a result, only American notes tended to be loose. Hong Kong notes were weak due to the ample supply of Hong Kong exchange rates. New notes were also weak. The rupee was uniquely firm due to the needs of importers. The absorption of Japanese gold notes was sluggish, with the evening market price at 1 yuan 2 jiao 6 fen 8 li. Korean notes also showed signs of loosening, with the evening market price at 1 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen 3 li.

<p>Securities are secretly firm. The market was quite firm and expensive yesterday. Most investors were very bullish. The reason why the debt market is rising is also due to the end of the year, and short sellers are very active in covering their positions. Type A bonds, due to the approaching lottery draw, need special excitement, and have actually been raised to 60 yuan. Type E bonds have also been raised by 8 yuan, and the situation is very good. It may continue to rise. Yesterday morning, the buying from Ji Kee was more active, and the appetite of Tong Kang was also not weak. Retail investors followed the trend to cover their positions. Only Jiu Feng was more lively on the selling side, and the price continued to rise by about 3 jiao. In the afternoon, Da Feng and Lianhe bought in a lot, and Numbers 16 and 63 also closed successively. However, Tong Shun, Datong Yi, and Tong Kang still sold at high prices, and the market price continued to hold steady. Type A bonds actually saw a new price of 60 yuan. As a result, the united front continued to rise by 4 jiao to 6 jiao and a half. Transactions totaled more than 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

Among industrial stocks, Yangtze River Bank, International Trust Company, and Yeguang Real Estate Company jointly reached new highs. At the same time, Jardine Textile Factory stock was able to stand firm at a price of 27 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Yarn and Cotton at the End of the Year; The Yarn Market is Quiet; Shenxin Urges Payment of Expired Loans <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains flat and stable, but the trend is slightly soft and depressed. This is because the overseas cotton market's rising trend has subsided, and Indian cotton is trending downwards. In addition, customer demand is as quiet as ever, and people's hearts are calm. Transactions are very light, and the range of ups and downs is very narrow. In addition, as the end of the year approaches, most operators are standing still, waiting for an opportunity to arrive before making a decision. Judging from the market situation, there may be new patterns in the red market after the New Year.</p>
<p>The spot market opened in the morning with scattered sentiment, because the rising trend of American cotton has stabilized, and near and long-term cotton prices are falling. Indian cotton has declined slightly, so there are few new buyers, and the market lacks momentum. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was 735 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Then, it was heard that foreign exchange was loosening, and people's hearts were relaxed again. The market remained stagnant for a long time, with no changes. The closing price was still 735 yuan. Transactions in half a day totaled 1,170 bales. The prices of 20-count Double Horse fell by 2 yuan, Tiannv fell by 1 yuan, and Double Earth was fatigued by 1 yuan. Today, 269 pieces are being transported to Tianjin and 175 pieces are being transported to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same Trade: 1,060; Inland: 25; Ningbo: 35; Fuzhou: 10; Nanyang: 40; Total: 1,170.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation of 20-count cotton yarn, considering the raw materials, should have a hope of trending upwards. How has it been hesitating between 730 yuan for a long time? In fact, inventory is full and customer sales are increasingly sluggish, so the pressure is still heavy. It is heard that Shenxin Factory has issued twelve months of futures, and is urging payment for those expiring in front of the way. They will be using the warehouse list to secure the silver. Recently opened the next year 12 month of 20 Double Horse's there were more than 10000 packets, expiration also take the same step, can't like in the past, an infinite delay. Furthermore, the factory also has more existing inventory.</p>

<p>The native cotton trade is showing slight signs of improvement. The mindset of merchants has become more active. However, factories are showing little activity. While market prices are high, the negotiating power appears quite strong. Furthermore, overseas markets appear peaceful, and Indian cotton is also trending downwards. Deliveries from northern Jiangsu are estimated at 558 bales of Nantong cotton and 482 bales of Changyinsha cotton. The current cotton transaction situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Separately, news on foreign cotton market prices: In the New York cotton market, initially this morning, due to the weakness of the stock market, the cotton market was under pressure from widespread selling, causing market conditions to decline. Later, due to some short covering, cotton prices rebounded. As a result, closing prices were lower than the previous day by 1-2 points for near-term contracts and higher by 5-6 points for deferred contracts. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by six rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by over twenty points. Liverpool cotton fell by seven or eight pence.</p>
<p>Transactions of foreign cotton in Shanghai have been lackluster recently, with an unusual calm across the board. Sales of yarn and cloth are both affected as merchants temporarily plan to wrap up business as the year-end approaches, as do Japanese manufacturers. Therefore, the entire city is unusually quiet all day. The factory prices for yesterday's cotton market, calculated with the US dollar exchange rate at 7.875, are as follows:</p>

The cake dough is not very glutinous yet, but the color is better. Asking prices have increased by about 40% compared to before, with wholesale prices at 55-56 yuan.</p>

<p>— Yu Xin</p>
<p>Written Amidst Fare Increase Announcements</p>
<p>Mr. Ji Fang's "Tram Fare Increase" made me feel that residents living on "the isolated island" are indeed burdened even more, causing the middle and lower salaried classes to cry out in agony.</p>
<p>However, salaried classes might still be able to support themselves, but the student community is the most severely affected. Many students in every school live far from the school, and they have no choice but to use transportation to avoid being late. Just look at the trams or buses every morning, often crowded with a large number of students holding books. I think there are quite a few whose families have financial difficulties. Their fathers and brothers already struggle to pay for high tuition and book fees, let alone bear the not-so-small extra transportation costs now? Therefore, we must urgently seek ways to remedy this.</p>
<p>As a student, I would like to make a suggestion to all my fellow "isolated island" residents: Let’s use our own feet and walk on the sidewalks.</p>
<p>I study at XX Middle School on Fuzhou Road, and my family situation is very ordinary. At first, I took the bus, but when the bus fare increased, I switched to the tram. However, the tram also increased its fare on the 22nd, so I started using my own "Route 11" vehicle, "a pair of feet." I just need to leave half an hour earlier than usual every morning, and I can get to school before 8 a.m. This not only saves transportation money but also provides an opportunity for exercise, because walking is indeed a very good "economical exercise." In this excellent opportunity of "saving money and improving health," we should also "thank" the transportation authorities for granting us this opportunity.</p>
<p>Below are the approximate walking times I gathered from classmates at my school who use "two-wheeled vehicles," for reference by students at other schools (with the Nanjing Road Ball Field as the destination, as that is where many schools are concentrated):</p>
<p>From Wangjiasha, it takes about half an hour to an hour.</p>
<p>From Fuxu Road Tongfu Road intersection, it takes about half an hour.</p>
<p>From Caishi Road Lafayette Road intersection, it takes about forty minutes.</p>
<p>From Lafayette Road Ladu Road intersection, it takes about an hour (and so on).</p>
<h3 id="e93">Closing Account Late Night Work <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xiangyun</p>
<p>Fragments of Bank Life</p>
<p>Twice a year, mechanically, the days for closing accounts come with Christmas. Night work unfolds in every bank, the central hub of society and economy.</p>
<p>On a winter night, the sharp northwest wind howls across the city's sky, and everything, moving or still, cowers and collapses wearily under the cold air. However, there is no winter in these tall buildings solidified and decorated with steel, cement, mica, and marble; each layer is like April days in late spring, so gentle and warm! The glow of electric torches and the heat waves of water heaters seem to form a curtain, shrouding this group of people who hold "golden rice bowls."</p>
<p>Neatly and regularly arranged desks are piled with messy documents and ledgers. Pens, ink, abaci, and stamps control everyone's nerves. Sleeves rolled up, heads bowed, and backs bent, the wisdom of heart and brain is completely poured into the transformation of numbers. The sound of the abacus is like a tune of joy and sorrow mixed, tensely and continuously interplaying. This relentless busyness is never partially tense and partially idle like it is during the day. The busyness of night work is consistent. Everyone is bustling in the same rhythm from all directions: The director with a pipe in his mouth, the trainees and tea servers delivering documents, are all working tensely. Everyone's hands keep waving, writing, and calculating, determining the fate of others and also determining their own fate—deficits or surpluses.</p>
<p>People who wallow in piles of money do not find the number of funds as rare and flavorful as ordinary people do. The savings department pays hundreds of thousands of interest on millions of savings, tens of thousands of interest on hundreds of thousands of savings, and a few cents or li of interest on a few dollars of savings. The amount of the number is produced on their abacus and pen tips. Then, they move it over very plainly, settling one account after another. The interest owed by the commercial business department is also settled one account after another according to the amount, the only difference being the interest rate.</p>
<p>Such a large night work venue is like a huge machine, a machine that records the flow of capital for capitalists! We cannot deny what others say about our banker's life being mechanical, nor can we refuse to accept the elegant name of "money slaves" that others give us. I thought this as I worked.</p>
<p>Although time is constantly slipping away, we hope it will pass faster. Although the air is tense and the whole place is lively, the individual feeling is lonely. The loneliness in the liveliness is even more desolate than the loneliness in the desert! Everyone is tired of working, so they stretch their backs, and only a very simple hope floats in their minds—to eat a midnight snack.</p>
<p>After the midnight snack is eaten, it is like the train having added enough coal, like the machine having added enough oil, and the work restarts, until the dawn splits the darkness of the eastern sky. Everyone then stretches their backs, drags their tired steps, walks out the door, braves the cold winter morning wind, and silently returns home.</p>

<p>(3) Water</p>
<p>In an alley with several hundred people, there are only two water taps.</p>
<p>Water in the alley is as precious as an oasis in the desert.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, many people scramble to get water, carrying lead buckets and wooden basins, crowding and clamoring...</p>
<p>When it's time to cook, the noise rises like a hurricane; some people have their shoes trampled off, sometimes children cry from being crowded, women quarrel and scold to get ahead, and occasionally, they even fight, grabbing and trying to kick over the water that the other person has managed to get...</p>
<p>The water in the alley is like a fairy spirit!</p>
<p>(4) Infanticide</p>
<p>The most terrifying thing in the alley is infanticide.</p>
<p>The fertility rate of the poor is increasing disproportionately; women in the alley cannot afford to be idle; doing laundry and cooking, who has time to breastfeed the child? But no one can stop the woman from becoming pregnant again. If she becomes pregnant, she has to raise the child. The burden on the family is already heavy enough, how can they bother with the infant and add another layer of unbearable burden?</p>
<p>Sadly, they suffocate the newborn infant; the young infant, having just entered the world, without growing, returns to the earth...</p>
<p>Those from the front alley throw it into the back alley; those from the back alley, in turn, abandon it in the front alley.</p>
<p>In the corners, people often find straw mats with bloodied infants, some still wrapped in cloth, some naked; their fate is tragic, causing physical harm to the mother, leaving the father with an indelible, painful impression, and immediately after leaving the womb, they are harmed by poverty...</p>
<p>In the alley, everyone lives day after day; the life of an infant is not as good as a wealthy family's dog; isn't injustice visible as soon as one opens their eyes? (End)</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Enjoying Flowers and Moon, Marriage Achieved; Planting Jade and Nurturing Pearls, Pregnancy is Skillful</p>
<p>Jin Danyu said, "With you here, there's so much more laughter and liveliness. That's why I like to travel with you the most, because you are the most interesting person." Wu Junsu said, "Maybe it was like that before, but it won't be like that in the future. Now that you have Brother-in-law accompanying you, why do you need your sister?" Jin Danyu said, "If that's the case, I wouldn't have invited you to join my honeymoon trip." Later, Wu Junsu agreed: there's no need to pick her up, she'll come to Shanghai again next Saturday. Originally, her home is in Shanghai, and coming and going is already a habit. Everyone on the train and at the station recognizes this Miss Wu who teaches at Soochow University. Tomorrow will be the wedding day of Lin Jiancheng and Jin Danyu. There's nothing to do in the morning; the excitement will begin at 3 p.m. The group of young ladies who came from Suzhou to attend the wedding are all busy with their own affairs. Zhu Airen went to visit her colleagues, some of whom work in hospitals, and some of whom have their own practices. However, even those who have their own practices mostly have a hospital-like setup. Because these days, people who are sick like to stay in hospitals. Besides those with minor illnesses who still insist on working, take some medicine, or rest at home for a few days to recover, most people feel that it is better to go to the hospital when they are sick. First, after all, hospitals have complete facilities, with nurses and doctors who can take care of you at any time. Moreover, the various medical inventions are constantly innovating. Doctors can carry small items, but some are installed in one place and cannot even be moved, so how can they not be convenient for patients in the hospital? Naturally, patients have to move to receive treatment. Furthermore, although Shanghai has expanded compared to before the war, the population is still dense, and houses in prosperous areas are still very crowded, so it is not suitable to recuperate at home. Also, because more people are willing to go to hospitals, the original few hospitals are not enough, and they often run out of beds. So, many small hospitals have been added in more remote areas. Doctors must register, and hospitals must also register. You are only allowed to open if you are legal. It cannot be like those private hospitals in the past, which could be opened casually. But there are still many people who are sick and unwilling or unable to go to the hospital, so they invite doctors to their homes for treatment. However, the health bureau and the medical association have set a fixed consultation fee, and each consultation fee is not allowed to exceed ten yuan. And you are not allowed to add various titles such as early consultation, late consultation, special consultation, and emergency consultation, so as to avoid burdening the patient's family.</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Only Western Restaurant in Shanghai: Random Thoughts on Norma Shearer's Acting <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Felt Monotonous Life after Husband's Death, Expressed Quite Tired of Film Life</p>
<p>Norma Shearer, the widow of the late MGM Vice President Irving Thalberg, has been formally affiliated with MGM since 1924 for nearly twenty years. Although she stopped her acting career for more than seven months after her husband's death, she resumed her work at the request of the company, and then filmed more than ten films such as "Marie Antoinette", "The Divorcee", "Strangers May Kiss", and "Her Cardboard Lover". According to statistics, from the first film she starred in, "He Who Gets Slapped", to the recent "We Were Dancing", she has starred in a total of 63 masterpieces. It can be said that as long as the works she stars in are publicly screened in theaters around the world, there is no one that does not have an amazing box office. Therefore, some people have estimated that MGM has earned at least 300 million US dollars from her works alone. However, the reason why she can continue to be a box office draw when she is old is because her acting skills do not decline with age, which is also her unique strength. Secondly, because eight or nine out of ten of the films she stars in are tragic protagonists, she can use various subtle techniques to express different personalities, as the recent "Strangers May Kiss" and "The Divorcee" are more obvious examples. It can be boldly said that in the current entire Hollywood, it is probably impossible to find a second character who can play a tragedy like her. Norma Shearer is now thirty-eight years old, so she has entered the middle-aged woman stage. Therefore, she often tells her close friends: "If the company wants me to continue filming non-stop, then it is undoubtedly equal to calling me to the grave early." She also said: "Since my husband died, all I feel in life is monotony and loneliness. I don’t feel interested in anything. I really seem like a lamb who lost its mother. There is nowhere for me to return, because the hope for the future has reached an impasse and I can no longer enter another paradise." Now her only hope is her seven-year-old daughter. Although she is so smart, she is as sick as her mother. She is either groaning on the bed or reading the teachings of the Virgin, so I just hope that I can raise her to adulthood. Indeed, the public believes that if she did not have this young daughter, she might have retired from the film industry long ago and lived a quiet and leisurely life alone.</p>
<p>In recent years, she has suddenly often expressed various complaints to friends about this arduous work under the spotlight, and even cursed this inhumane work. Now she is most afraid of reading scripts, heavy makeup, and singing love songs, but it is not that she is no longer competent, because these things probably no longer interest her. Indeed, Norma Shearer is old, and maybe it won't be long before we no longer see her on the screen.</p>
<p>Colorful Legends</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Wizard of Oz <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xu</p>
<p>Imbuing Wisdom, Benevolence and Courage into Myths</p>
<p>"The Wizard of Oz" uses color and divine miracles to innovate. The plot progression of the past "A Midsummer Night's Dream" fell into the shortcomings of dullness and symbolism. Although it had considerable success in terms of magic, the appreciation of "Snow White" can be rated as "very wonderful," but the depiction of the characters is dead, limited to the outlines of the brush, and cannot fully express emotions. This "The Wizard of Oz" selects the essence of the two films and adds careful processing, and adjusts the composition, color performance, and plot in a "serious" manner. Its plot is to take a country girl to dream of wonderland, bringing out the characters of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow has no brains, the Tin Woodman has no conscience, and the Cowardly Lion has no courage. The four of them travel together to visit the immortal. During the journey, they experience many difficulties, but they overcome all the difficulties with the efforts of the four of them. As a result, the country girl is captured, and the witch demonstrates her power. Finally, with the courage of the three in one, the Scarecrow uses cleverness, the Tin Woodman activates conscience, and the Cowardly Lion gathers courage to rescue the country girl. The weaknesses of the three are finally self-corrected.</p>
<p>The color of the whole film is bright and dazzling. It uses color to symbolize everything in the characterization of each character, and the color matching also reaches a peak. The fairy men and fairy women in the dwarf fairy kingdom are all dwarves of less than three feet, which is also rare. As for the clouds and fog, calling wind and rain, magic fire ten feet, and the ten thousand rays of the dawn, which are necessary for mythical films, there are also clever performances. The producer of "The Wizard of Oz" is Mervyn LeRoy, and the director is Victor Fleming, both of whom are famous in the film industry. The female lead is Judy Garland.</p>
<h3 id="e99">A Record of the New Spring and Autumn Drama School Students Performing "Wild Grasses and Idle Flowers" <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The emergence of the New Spring and Autumn Drama School seems to have caused a stir in the education community of the isolated island this year. This time, the charity performance organized by the school was held at the Hollywood Orchestra. The play "Wild Grasses and Idle Flowers," the first performance yesterday, is the artistic crystallization of those admitted students under three months of training.</p>
<p>"Wild Grasses and Idle Flowers" was written by Li Junpan. And the dialogue has been revised by Mandarin expert Mr. Gongshang. The story tells the story of a young master who marries a tea house girl privately. Two years after the marriage, the young master's father unexpectedly wants him to get engaged again. As a result, the other party went to court to file a complaint for bigamy. The young master's father knew that there was no hope for a peaceful solution, so he had to hire a lawyer who had been a judge for many years to handle the case. After a trial, the judge asked both parties to try to reconcile first. So the great lawyer invited the plaintiff to his office. Who knew that during a conversation, the lawyer discovered that the so-called tea house girl was actually the daughter of his lover of twenty years ago. At the same time, he understood that his lover of nearly twenty years was poor and died three years after their love crystallization was born. And the young master suddenly realized that to fight for freedom of marriage, he must get rid of the shackles of the feudal family. He had a conflict with his father and re-invited witnesses to remarry the tea house girl.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, because the students of the school are all young children, due to experience, or more due to lack of cultivation, although they did their best in makeup, the performance still seemed stiff and emphasized.</p>
<p>Xiang Ti Yu Xiaoyu, his moving frivolousness, is inconsistent with his experienced conversation; and he is so restrained; Hu Feng's role as the tea house owner lacked prudence; Chen Chancheng's role as the young master seemed unnatural, but they were still on stage for the first time, and they had only studied for three months, which is still forgivable.</p>
<p>Another thing to mention is Shi Conghou, who played the young master's father. His acting, regardless of movements, conformed to the attitude of an elderly gentleman. Secondly, Xu Zuomin, who played the lawyer, was also able to perform well.</p>

<p>Is Gui Junqing Still Alive?</p>
<p>Among the oldest amateur opera singers, Jia Honglin, Wang Yutian, and Gui Junqing are the most famous. Jia Wu died early, and Junqing was originally an amateur who became a professional. He graduated from the Beijing School of Translators and was fluent in Russian, so he worked as a clerk in a Russian foreign company. He lived in Yantai and Harbin for a long time, but because he liked to sing, he spared no effort to imitate Tan Xinpei's style. Later, he lost his job because he followed the old Tan too closely and incurred the dissatisfaction of the foreign manager. However, he did not consider this unfortunate, but felt that he could concentrate on learning Tan opera. At that time, the old Tan was in his middle age and was actively trying to gain fame, so this Mr. Gui saw a lot of good performances by the old Tan. It is also said that there were too many good actors at that time, such as Wang Datou, Sun Juxian, and Xu Yintang, who often performed. Mr. Gui was knowledgeable, so when he later became a professional actor, he was excellent in singing, reciting, performing, and acting, as well as body movements and stage steps. When the famous Bangzi opera actor Tian Jiyun presided over Tian Le Yuan, Junqing played the role of "Hong Yang Cave" and was welcomed by the audience. Since then, he became famous in the world for his Tan opera style. Soon, his voice declined, and he devoted himself to working hard on his acting and reciting, like Jia Honglin in the past. During the years of the Republic of China (1918-1919), he also performed on stage in Shanghai for a long time. His "Selling Horses," "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," "Stealing the Imperial Decree," "Heavenly Thunder Retribution," "Hong Yang Cave," and "Beating the Stick Out of the Box" all had unique features. Although his voice was not very good at that time, he was still able to win praise by occasionally performing "Empty City Stratagem" and "Debate with the Confucian Scholars." First, because he was knowledgeable and came from an amateur background, when he played the role of Zhuge Liang, he looked the part as soon as he came on stage, because scholarly air cannot be learned by force, so he was an unusual actor.</p>
