<h3>一般生活問題之調整</h3>
<p>自壟斷居奇營逐攘奪之米市，經兩租界當局出而維持後，俶擾不寗之民生，至此已得見小康；蓋不容投機操縱，則風不揚波，市面自易歸於安定。惟念米市操縱之由來，尚始於最近數月間，事必有其因，勢必有可乘，操縱米市蓋與百物騰貴爲因緣，亦以掠奪留難爲厲階，否則米商雖欲居奇而不得也。於是言之，欲措民生於安定，應不僅限制米價之上升，凡屬民生日用所需，共與米價佔同樣之重要地位者，宜莫不在平準之列。而凡百梗阻，其足以影饗民生者，尤宜共謀解脫之方。否則小康且不獲持久，遑論安定。</p>
<p>夫欲平準物價，必先貨暢其流。今日之所患，正爲運輸之不暢；不暢則供求失其勻整，物價乃起軒輊；起伏之間，黠者遂因緣爲利焉。投機貿販之徒如逐臭之蠅，無往不集，營求繁殖，散播毒菌，若不有蠅拍以掃除之，勢將危害及於大衆之生存；故投機操縱日用生活品者，在所必禁。輓近經濟部頒有取締日用必需品囤積辦法，此後滬市取締，已不患無所依據。且懲一足以儆百，證以工部局未取締操縱米市之際，油價飛漲，粉價日高；其後禁令雷厲風行，不稍寬假，旣不可以情勢干，又不可以要挾勝，於是他業他貨亦稍稍畏懾摺伏，幡然改圖；如囤積之豆油，竟於前日正市中，一跌二十元；粉價欲前而其行趦趄，此非取締操縱所見之明效乎？至於運輸問題，此在戰事中固不能通暢如平時；而上海貨運之不能通暢，雖日戰事影響，其實並非眞因戰事；蓋上海四周千百里內，此一年有餘，未嘗有正式之作戰也。有謂日軍爲圖見好於美國，已允將長江下游開放，此後日用生活品之運輸，尤其爲米糧，必較前便利。開放之說是否得行，本報已評述之矣；更瞪以近事，上海日軍當局嘗有協力消弭上海米恐慌之表示，而滬市四鄉扣留之米船，舳艫相接，內地車站截住之運米車輛，何止數百，誰實爲之，孰令致之，而後知運輸問題決不以長江下游之一聲開放而遽得通暢也。雖然，事有不容長此遷延者。上海爲特殊之國際市塲，人人應盡愛護之責，今乃向內地採辦之貨，動遭扣留；日用生活必需之品，輒被攔截；上海居民不能維持其生活，勢必遺棄上海，試問上海尚得保持此畸形之繁榮乎？上海居民因物價高貴至無術顧全其生存，且又無法高飛遠舉時，誰能保其不鋌而走險，則上海尚能維持其完善之秩序，工商業尚能維持其正常之營業乎？因是之故，各國倘不忘情於中國市塲，則對於上海一隅之運輸，務必協力以求其通暢；而於上海日常生活必需品之供求，更應共謀有效之辦法，俾達到調節平準之目的。蓋保持上海居民之生活安定，市塲繁榮，所關不僅爲居民之福利；愛護今日之上海，以待「自由中國」復興之來臨，庶幾共享樂利於無疆。</p>
<p>此外與大衆生活有其極密切之關係者，莫如水電與公共交通器具之取費。取費若高，則不論貧富，莫不增加其負担。以言電，其成本除機件鍋爐架設桿錢等之永久設備外，其他可視爲發電之成本者，只爲煤與水。水亦除鍋爐機件埋置水管建築水池水塔之永久設備外，其他可視爲水之成本者只爲電，水源灝汗，固不費分文者也。電車除車輛綫軌等之永久設備外，所賴以發動其車輛者亦爲電，且以交流之結果，故電量之消耗亦至有限。公共汽車除車輛外，唯一之成本爲汽油。此外如房屋修繕器具薪工等之支出，固皆爲成本之一，然當分別以論。蓋固定資產之購置敷設，皆不始自今日，容有添置，則爲營業發展應有之結果，爲數自必有限；故萬不可以目前之幣値，而將固定資產，作再度之估價，以逐優厚之利潤。而况正爲其有繁重之設備，又爲公用事業，不容取費過高，故許其獨占營業，藉杜競爭，所以保護之者至周。卽如燈電一度之成本，究有幾何？所售幾何？就所聞見，在戰前爲數絕微，故如電力電熱之取費，遠較燈電爲低，又有優待大用戶歷級取費辦法，尚有利潤可獲；則租界以內，燈電之應用甚鉅，利益之優厚可見。縱使煤價大貴，人工略增，亦何須一再漲價，高出平常一倍以上，方足保持所期待之利益乎？以言水，容或電費略增，但有其特約在，決不至如一般所增加者爲鉅。電車與水公司情形正相似。汽車則爲汽油之價貴，此二者亦已屢行加價矣。夫物價之上漲必有其理由，且如公用事業之漲價，必經工部局之核准而後行。工部局自必站在公正之立塲上，一方面固應保全公用事業經營者之利益，一方面亦必深切考慮上海市民之生活，已極艱難困頓，爲稍輕公衆之負擔計，應使另一方面之投資者稍减少其收益；截長補短，事屬權宜，况舉世擾攘，投資上海者尤宜克己以適應大時代；且獨佔事業究非普通工商業可比，而孜孜以營利爲目的也。故希望此後能得一適當時機，對於水電公用車輛之取費，重行加以一番考訂也。</p>
<p>最足予上海居民以威脅者，莫如房租之遞增，經營房產者，今亦藉辭於百物皆貴，巧立名目，作加租之口實。吾人以爲目前各業必不得已而加價，必爲其新置之產業，新近之出品，成本旣重，應有取償。若房屋之非新建者，卽使物價昂貴，不但其成本如舊，且無形中已因此而增加其產業之價値，萬不應趁火打刧，或偏重一時的幣値觀念，作壓迫租戶之想。而事實所在，一般房地產業所憧憬往來者，正爲如何作加租之企圖。及至房租旣貴，分租愈多，疊牀架屋，噓氣成雲，此其景象，不啻地獄，遑論衛生。此則吾人所不能不向深居華堂大厦之業主，作迫切之呼籲者也。凡此實况，皆關大衆生活之榮枯，社會秩序之安危，公衆衛生之良窳，甚望租界當局，爲大多數市民謀福利，就一般生活問題，善爲調整，亦所以保持租界繁盛之道也。</p>

<h3>斯達林小史（續）</h3>
<p>一九一三年二月二十三日斯氏在聖彼得堡復又被捕，流徙極遠之吐魯漢斯克省四年。一九一四年夏末第一次帝國主義大戰爆發，斯氏乃與列寗及黨中央之關係暫時切斷，但斯氏對於戰爭，和平及革命之問題，仍與列寗同採國際主義之立場。一九一七年三月二十五日斯氏重返聖彼得堡，其時該市已為俄國之革命首都。列寗當時尚在外國，斯達林即於此困難嚴重時期中以公認的黨領袖資格，團結布爾雪維克黨從事解決新問題。</p>
<p>列寗返國後，斯氏則與列寗共同對卡曼湼夫及萊格夫之叛黨活動極力鬥爭。一九一七年四月黨中央會議後、斯氏當選為中央委員會政治局委員，嗣後由彼時直至現在，絕未間斷。一九一七年七月事變後，列寗被反革命臨時政府壓迫。不得不匿跡秘密地點，斯氏乃直接指導黨中央委員會及中央機關，領導全黨及工人階級準備社會主義革命之武裝暴動。在此次暴動中，斯達林為列寗最密切的戰友，並直接指揮一切準備工作。暴動之計劃及日期均由渠親自指導決定。同時渠並以全力暴動及反抗十月革命之破壞者，齊諾維夫，卡曼湼夫及萊柯夫。</p>
<p>十月革命勝利後，全俄蘇維埃代表大會立即選出第一屆人民委員長會議，列寗任主席，斯達林為委員長之一，由彼時起至一九二三年止，均任人民民族事業委員長職務。因此乃得直接指導黨及蘇維埃政府關於解決國內民族問題之全部工作。『俄國各民族權利宣言』即由渠起草。</p>
<p>內戰時期，黨中央委會及列寗本人曾指派斯達林往各地最重要最危險之前綫。因此斯氏曾任西綫，南綫及西南綫革命軍事委員會委員，在沙里青，斐爾盂，彼得格拉，南綫及抵抗波蘭白軍等戰役中斯氏之戰略天才及鐵的意志均為革命軍獲得勝利之主因。各次勝利均由斯氏親自組織促成。一九一九年十一月二十七日全俄中央執行委員會由列寗建議，曾下令表彰斯氏在內戰前綫之功績，並頒與紅旗勳章。</p>
<p>蘇聯開始和平經濟建設後，斯達林又與列寗共同領導全黨反托洛茨基派及其他一切企圖阻礙黨對國內經濟生活一切問題取得解決之反動團體之鬥爭。一九二二年由列寗推薦，斯達林當選為黨中央委會總書記。</p>
<p>一九一八年列寗被刺，受傷甚重，健康日趨衰弱，一九二一年底起，更寗即不得不時時停止工作而領導全黨之任務乃由斯達林担負。此期內，斯氏工作成績極為偉大。渠創造各民族蘇維埃共和國，然後將所有共和國團結組成唯一的蘇維埃社會主義共和國聯邦。</p>
<p>一九二四年列寗逝世後，托洛斯基及其黨與企圖引離脫離列寗路綫，斯達林乃揭發托氏活動真面目，集中全黨力量將托氏完全擊敗。</p>
<p>一九二四年斯氏之理論著作『列寗主義基本問題』及『十月革命與俄國共產黨之戰術』出版。此兩著作揭出之原則，即成為黨關於在蘇聯建設社會主義各決議案之基礎。嗣後工業化及工作即在斯氏指導下進行。一切工業新部門之創造，大工廠之建立，均以斯氏為主要推動者，斯氏並經常注意其建設過程。</p>
<p>在斯達林領導下，黨又解決了無產階級革命取得政權後最困難之任務，即農業集體化與掃蕩剝削階級最後殘餘當農。一九二八—二九年黨開始對富農進攻時，布哈林，萊柯夫，托姆斯基及其反動黨徒竟公然出頭反對黨的路綫。斯達林乃澈底暴露此輩右傾派，證明彼等乃富農在黨內之代理人，而動員全黨加以擊潰。</p>
<p>由於工業農業改造之結果，蘇聯國民經濟乃得有全世界最新式之機械設備。工業得有無量數的機器；農業得有優良之國產曳引機，聯合機及其他機件。運輸業亦得有上等汽車，機車，輪船，飛機等無數。紅軍則得有優越的配備—砲隊，戰車，飛機及戰艦。此浩大無限的技術改造工作均由期達林親自指導完成。渠尤注意紅軍之軍備建設，因而紅陸海空軍乃成為無敵武力。在斯氏領導下，民衆中已勃起十百萬的天才人員，强大的優秀人物的斯達罕諾夫運動乃普及於全國</p>
<p>整個國民經濟之社會主義的改造，結果更使國內階級關係完全變更。因此，一九二四年通過成立之憲法乃不得不修正。由斯達林提議，七屆全蘇蘇維埃代表大會遂將此問題加以討論，決議組織憲法委員會由斯氏主席起草新憲法草案。此草案經全國展開討論五個半月之後，由八屆非常蘇維埃代表大會於一九三六年十二月五日通過成立。全蘇人民一致稱之為斯達林憲法。</p>
<p>一九三七年十二月十二日，蘇聯最高議會根據新憲法選舉成立。全國九千四百萬選民中，九千一百餘萬，即百分之九十六·八·曾實行投票，其中九千萬一致投票選舉斯達林主義共產黨員及非黨員集團之候選人。</p>
<p>一九三九年三月斯達林更釐定蘇聯進一步向共產主義進展之綱領。渠指定其主要任務，為於十年至十五年內在經濟方面追及並超出各先進資本主義國家。渠申述在資本包圍環境下，社會主義國家必須繼續存在並更臻强固。（二十一日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>本屆大學　統一招生考試概況（十一）</h3>
<p>文科各校需要人數（以下簡稱需）九一九人，分發人數（以下簡稱分）四四七人、法科需六四〇五、分六三四人、師範科需一〇九〇、分六六〇人、商科需三九〇、分一〇六人、理科需一一〇五、分四二八人、工科需二二三五、分一七九二人、農科需七四〇、分二三三人、醫科需四四〇、分二五三人、總計各校需要七五五五人、分發四五五三人（特別生三人未列入）、</p>
<p>右表各校需要總人數、係包括上海各校在內、分發學生數、文理農商各科、尚不及需要之半數、師範及醫學院、亦僅及三分之二、法科因志願政治經濟者特分發、故多已足額、工學院各系爲土木、機械·電機•航空等系志願最多、而採冶紡織測量等系太少、故分發仍不足額、可見今年考生志願集中於工科而尤集中於土木•機械·電機·航空等系、以分發總額而論、較需要總額尚少三千餘人、加入上海區錄取八一五名、尚不够二千餘人、於此可以證明今年錄取學生並不爲寬、</p>
<p>此外、錄取於先修班學生的分發、均按照所定標凖依其考區就近分配於敎育部特設先修班、西南聯大·雲南大學·西北大學·西北師範學院·浙江大學·浙大龍泉分校·廣西大學·國立師範學院•曁南大學等先修班　每班五十人至七十餘人、</p>
<p>（四）分發的說明、分發的程序、這樣的麻煩、分發的情形、這樣的困難、可是一般人常認爲分發是一回簡單的事情、尤其是錄取的學生、常責難敎部沒有分發到他志願的學校和院系、他們有一種誤解、以爲旣經考取、照志願分發、是沒有問題的、甚或以分次的高低、認爲分發不公允、他決不想到同志願的有多少，他所志願的學校容量如何、他的成績在同志願中排列的地位、我現在可以舉一個例子、張生在重慶投考第二組、總分三百五十、名次第四十五、第一志願中央大學航空茶、第二志願中央大學機械系、第三志願西南聯大電機系、</p>
<p>李生亦在重慶投考第二組、總分二百八十、名次第八十五、第一志願中央大學機械系、第二志願中央大學水利系、第三志願武漢大學電機系、上面的例子、假定中央大學航空素容量爲三十名、照前面志願分析統計看來、以中大航空系爲志願者二百二十一人、張生分數雖高、但分數排列在三十名之外、故額滿見遺、第二志願中大機械系、因以此系爲第一志願者、即已取錄足額、又不能分發、其第三志願西南聯大　機系、亦早已足額、結果張生致被指派於其他工學院未足額之機械系、李生分數較張生低中大機械系目亦不能分發而其第二志願中大水利系因志願者少、李生成績排列在其容量名額以內、結果即被取入此系、如以學校來說、張生分數多、名次高、反被指派其他大學、李生分數少、名次低、皮被分發於中央大學、</p>

<p>籌集洋米基金辦法</p>

<p>當局函復保護米商</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業同業公會前因搶米風熾、爲要求當局保護正當米商、除迭次推派代表分別晋謁公共租界工部局何副總辦、及法租界公董局負責人、茲公共租界工部局業已函復該會、茲錄其原函如下、逕啟者，接奉十二月十八日台函、敬悉一是、關於本局告示所述各節、專係對付一班囤戶而發、並非直接對付貴會正當米商、本局且已咨照警務處、對於正當米行、務須盡力保護、俾得各安生業也、此致、豆米業同業公會，</p>
<p>民食調節方案芻議</p>
<p>民食調節會理事黃延芳氏昨發表關於上海民食調節方案芻議、略謂、日來米市雖經租界當局嚴厲取締於先、復由社會人士彼此勸導於後、小數囤積者、稍具畏心、急於晚手、米店因時鬧搶米、發生糾紛、於是意存消極、米價乃得暫時穩定、其實明鬆暗緊、後患之來、方興未艾、尋求調節方案、如火迫眉捷、萬不容緩、管見所及、欲求米價平定、先決條件、</p>
<p>存底充足</p>
<p>須存底足、米價自平矣、其法維何、先由各同業公會、通知各會員廠號、儘速集團訂購洋米、以六個月食糧爲最少限度、並須包括每一廠號之夥友全家食米在內、向協會登記、由協會用公開方式、向外洋直接訂購、貨到照成本售與各廠號、先付定洋每包若干元、向協會登記、須以每一同業公會爲單位、倘貨到價跌、會員廠號、觀望不出、由該公會自行理直、協會方面、於收受各同業公會定洋外、再向銀錢業商議墊款辦法、（此節已籌有眉目將來貨到時可由各公會陸續備價出米）中上級家庭、亦可照上列辦法、向協會登記、</p>
<p>訂購洋米</p>
<p>總之、以不與升斗階級爭糴爲原則、即使將來米價回跌、各廠號雖稍蒙損失、而爲數非鉅、况來年靑黃小接之秋、米價如何、尤難逆料、犧牲小我、何樂不爲、至於各廠號代各工友訂購食米、使無後顧之憂、則能專心業務、無形中獲有巨大效果、或曰依此辦法、對於稍具經濟能力者之食米籌之妥矣、而升斗階級者將安從得米乎、曰、此中自有因果在矣、彼囤積居奇者、其計以爲得矣、一旦上述辦法實行、則囤米將無人過問、而所囤者大都均屬本米、質難久貯、勢不得不忍痛脫手、一售而跌、再售再跌、平價之目的達到、升斗者樂、囤積者苦矣、以子之矛、攻子之盾、計豈左乎、有人主張以</p>
<p>平糶方法</p>
<p>爲調節方案、法固可取、惟羣衆廣大、非有巨數的款、殊覺難乎爲繼、若能以集團訂購洋米與辦平糶雙管齊下、則收效自宏矣、其辦法於訂購洋米項下、每包收費一二元（名稱另定）、即以此項收入、移作平糶經費、在訂購者雖每包多付一二元、其實若向米店購米、米店利得或恐不只此一二元也、若平糶經費全賴募捐、恐不足恃、</p>

<h3>中農五角舊輔劵　委托中行代兌　運滬新輔幣劵五十萬元　係屬外灘滙豐銀行所有</h3>
<p>中國農民銀行上海分行、爲救濟市面輔幣恐慌、除有一部份五角券、託由中行賡續兌換外、並留大部由該行照常辦理兌換事宜、惟需限以正當商人、兌換數量、概視其需要程度、五十萬元中農角券、係由英商匯豐銀行訂購、兌換日期有待、</p>
<p>中行代兌中農輔劵</p>
<p>霞飛路中農滬行、前為滬市角劵奇缺、奸商乘機牟利、曾將收回存庫之白底藍印五角券、儘量提出兌換、調劑市面、但至目前、市面角券、仍感不敷流通、爰將一部份五角券、再託亞爾培路中央銀行滬分行辦理兌換工作、並在該行門前揭貼通告、上書「五角輔幣劵、請向逸園中央銀行兌換」字樣、據悉中行兌換數額、每商號以五十元爲限、倘有正當商人、需要多數、則可預備函件、向該中農分行、請求兌換、然其數量、概由該行視其需要程度核准之、</p>
<p>滙豐訂運輔幣調劑</p>
<p>外灘英商匯豐銀行、因感於市面輔幣缺乏問題、仍未獲得圓滿解決、影響平民生計、至大且鉅、遂由香港方面向中農港辦事處訂購新輔幣劵五十萬元、兌換日期有待、此五十萬新劵、均係英商匯豐自己訂購、與中農並無關係、新劵計分一，角二角兩種、係中國大業公司承印、正面藍色爲一農村版圖、註明「中華民國二十六年印」字樣、反面爲棕色並有花紋、聞業已在內地發行、故運滬之中農券、並非中農所有也、</p>

<h3>亞細亞火油公司　發生怠工風潮</h3>
<p>滬公司同人已暫允復工　楊樹浦職工聞尚有問題本埠外灘一號英商亞細亞火油公司分設辦事處碼頭貨棧於楊樹浦及浦東等處、前（十九）日起、該公司楊樹浦部分職工以邇來生活指數日高、維持生計、至感困難、經一度集議、乃於二十日推出代表、向公司當局提出請求改善待遇、外灘部分職工、旋亦同時提出請求、</p>
<p>要求兩項</p>
<p>據聞該公司千餘職工所提要求、計有兩項、（一）米價在二十元至四十元之間者、一律增加津貼二十元、四十五元以上者津貼三十元、（二）年底紅利、向爲薪金半月、應請改發全月、並向公司方面請求於三日內答覆、該公司以大班現在東京、忽促之間、無法解決、故截至昨晨雖以約三天之期已滿、而公司方面仍未能作具體之答復、</p>
<p>一度商談</p>
<p>昨日上午十時許、職工方面復推代表姚·李•兩氏、往謁該公司人事部長英人密期金（譯音）、要求接受職工要求、並鄭重聲明同人純正之立塲、決不受任何方面利用、此次要求改善待遇、實爲生活所迫、應請當局諒解苦衷、經一小時之商討、當局仍以大班離滬、未能切實答復、兩代表乃怏怏而返、</p>
<p>引起糾紛</p>
<p>因改善待遇問題之未得具體結果、及職工代表姚李　氏復往訪三班英人時、該英人答語、稍形强硬、於是全體職工、於昨日上午十一時開始怠工乃一面並赴工部局工業科籲請調解、在怠工時間、外灘職工、異常遵守秩序、故頗爲整肅、午刻外灘公司方面、曾爲視察楊樹浦職工情形、由一白俄駕車前往、詎料該處職工間多席地坐臥、該車於將次到達時、與職工發生糾紛、致當塲碾傷工友六七名、</p>
<p>有人煽動</p>
<p>日方控制下之「中華工人福益會」、前此為綸昌公司工潮、曾參與其間、致綸昌工潮糾紛多時、此次該公司楊樹浦職工復告怠工、於是「福益會」方面復有人企圖控制、昨悉該處巳有日方憲兵多名在廠房外看守、其怠工情勢與外灘方面相較、殊覺空氣與環境、均迴不相同也、</p>
<p>職工嚴正</p>
<p>至於外灘方面昨日上午十一時怠工後、忽有兩日籍靑年、馳往該處、操不甚流利之言語、向職工方面表示、謂渠等甚願爲職工帮忙、惟全體職工以此次要求改善待遇、宗旨純正、且公司過去對於職工、本極協調、不欲因此益滋糾紛、故對該不明來源之兩靑年始終未予理會、全體職工此種深明大義之精神、聞公司方面頗感忻慰、</p>
<p>當局調解</p>
<p>昨日下午三時、工部局工業科顧炳元、至該公司辦公處召集勞資雙方進行調解、因大班離滬、一時無人負責、由顧君負責於下星期五（廿九日）對同人所提二項要求、必有滿意答復、勸令先行復工、同人代表認為滿意、並當塲要求三班、對同人職業、須有切實保障、亦經接受、遂於四時許全體復工、故外灘公司辦公處之職工風潮、暫時司告一段落、惟楊樹浦浦東部分恐將節外生枝、未易解決也、在怠工數小時內、有先施•五洲·滙德豐·等各大公司、均派代表携帶物品前往慰問、該公司同人對此互助精神、殊爲感謝、</p>

<h3>油市　大上大落　豆油反跌為漲　油拼油質地愈劣　人欺人生活更難</h3>
<p>豆油行市、昨承上日收盤時之餘風、反跌爲漲、大局潛勢完全是人心做作、結果比上日市猛提六元至九元、統計成交靑島桶油十桶、價爲一百十元、江北桶油六十桶、價爲一百元及一百零四元、常州來廠油二十桶、價爲一百零三元、大有廠油三百擔、價自八十二元至八十五元、膠州油一百件、價爲八十元、靑岐油一百五十件、價爲八十一元、烟岐油一百件、價爲八十二元、刻下行情之漲跌、相差五六元、不以爲奇、蓋在此非常期內、發國難財者、大都是大來大往、不若平蜻時五分一角尚須力爭、故在孤島上求生活、對於物價變遷、竟須另換一副目光、亦足見生活艱難人欺人之劇烈矣、</p>
<p>且聞現在之生豆油、價愈貴而質愈劣、攙雜愈多、白澆油攙於生油、已成公開之秘密、又聞豆油自廠家出來、即攙有二成棉子油、一到市上、續有攙人、有多至六成者、即十成之中、僅四成爲豆油、棉子油在大德初辦時、係用石灰澄淸、故其性燥熱、拼於其他油中、有熱病者服之、無形中增加病勢、然發「油炙檜」、若用此油炙沸、則油條硬直、不易潮軟、其後改用蛤殼粉以代替石灰、則性較溫和矣、（特）</p>
<h3>糧食　青角薄稻有利　米市活動　洋米漲起元許</h3>
<p>昨日內地來源、由汽車運到靑檔薄稻五百餘包、洋米續有抵埠、銷塲自漸活動後、昨則本鄉店胃、早市卽都出手、一時成交頗旺、其中尤以洋米去路最佳、故行情在栗落中步步挺秀、若西貢早市、雖仍開三十六元半、收盤已爲三十七元二角、（參閱後則）較前市提升半元光景、餘外蘆羊尖相隨帶好三五角、客尖因受限例、仍開三十三元、砶米爲三十一元半、三十二元、厚薄粳高貨猶爲四十元、中段貨亦好半元左右、白元貨稀胃香、時令品獨增元許耳、午市形勢、自各貨提高後、無論零躉去路、又復轉懈、市面再度回平、統計全市成交數不下七八千包、總之市面已在逐步恢複原狀、而市塲情形業見澄淸、除正常之交易外、一般素抱投機之囤戶、全見匿跡、僅將前者手中剩貨、續在拋出、故市面雖殊興旺、米價平穩、不若前之暴亂無限也、以後內地來源一旦疏通、米價更可逐步回廉矣、</p>
<p>客秈新到近千包、途貨雖可絡繹來滬、但自滬價三十二三元售開、江北等產價成本已難通運、故今後到源、或須逐步减少、客囤售意轉堅、兼被洋米激漲與舖銷之影響、中次各秈隨亦暗砌三四角、而高檔以上均難接近妥交云、</p>
<p>洋米定貨雖在相繼來滬中、惟產地售價昨又喊高、而現貨以本街各舖營業均見恢復、消化突旺、兼有行客鄕作問津、市又拾級上升、一百九十八斤原包逐漲至四十四元八角、現貨一百六十斤市石組亦自三十六元八角開至三十七元半、比之前日各漲一元以上、</p>
<h3>粉市鬆軟　麥價咼定次疲</h3>
<p>麵粉　本街銷塲、尚稱活絡、客銷平淡如故、各廠對於本街需要、原係維持性質、且廠盤亦不易一再提高、市面已入平坦之途、回籠貨受客銷呆滯影響、亦已無形鬆軟、棧單貨價在八元八九角之間、本街批價仍爲八元七角、日廠粉進出兩少、因封關期近、交易不暢亦呈盤旋狀態、聞十二月份鳳凰牌開價八元一角半、一月份八元四角六分云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市供求兩少、各廠以近來粉銷不旺、需胃漸淡、除高擋取辦外、中次麥更不貪取、故市面亦屬高定次疲、統市廠辦祇三千包、價仍站十五元原價、聞中次麥棧交貨成交二三車、價已暗小一二角云、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債又起漲風</h3>
<p>證券暗盤昨日市况多空雙方競爭甚烈、買戶頗稱踴躍、而賣戶亦極爲熱鬧、觀檯面趨勢、尚有續漲之象、觀賣戶之背景、則又似有恃無恐、買戶方面、自日本政黨方面如芳澤等至平表示中日戰事、非中國之福亦非日本之福、此次國會期中、政黨聞將大事活動、謀取政權、又將回復日本侵華前之局面、旦英國駐大阪領事懷德之來滬、與英大使密商、有謂係中英日三方面之事、且外電亦傳中日和平條件有接近之說、則債市前途或有較鉅之波動、全日買賣以大康成始終湧賣爲最堪注意、而買戶都屬零星、午市因大康成賣出絡繹不斷、致漲勢受其頓挫、順康買進爲數不多、散戶需要爲殷、午後大康成繼續賣出、爲數尤多、順康大豐聯益等買進、市價雖略爲抬高、而氣勢爲遜、故成交數約有八十萬元之譜、丁種未有成交市價結果一致回漲一角半至四角半不等、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市、雖生橡皮趨勢疲軟、及大衆對於假日觀念濃厚、價格仍甚堅穩、基於以上二因、交易未免稀少、但買方行動至佳、是爲假期後市况將有開展之良好徵象、</p>
<p>倫敦二十一日雷、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、又告上升、麥加利銀行升三先令九便士、價爲八鎊八先令九便士、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股升一鎊、價爲八十三鎊、香港註冊股亦升半鎊、價爲八十五鎊、開平煤礦股升六便士、價爲十七先令六便士、其餘不動、</p>

<h3>金融　外滙出多進少</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、各匯俱平、英美滙暗市、情况平庸、靜中略形鬆硬、雖午後路透社電傳、據某一方面觀察、中日和平條件、似漸接進、但此項消息、平淡無奇、投機者不予重視、當日經過、晨開均平、少頃華銀行稍有吃胃、致市勢曾略現緊態、但不久香港前來電塞、再加客商拋賣繼後、且華銀行亦出多進少、故情勢及形鬆硬、斯時英金告四辦士七〇三一二五、美匯爲七元七一八七五、嗣因進口商等乘機購結、價乃轉平、迄至午收、英金爲四辦土六八七五，美匯爲七元六八七五、午後爲狀恬靜、祇港電復稍吐出、結果以四辦士七〇三一二五、及七元七一八七五收盤、較上日軋鬆〇四六八七五及〇六二五、期貨潛勢、與現貨無異、</p>

<p>午後英滙未做開</p>
<p>後市岑寂異常、英匯且未聞做開、美滙僅港電吐予有利現貨價七元七一八七五、此後在平靜狀態下、即告收盤、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士七〇三一二五、美匯七元七一八七五、下月期英金四辦士六七一八七五、美滙七元五九三七五、結果比上日現期英均鬆〇四六八七五、美俱賤〇六二五、</p>

<h3>金市下疲</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、好景不常、復入疲境、蓋以滙市重趨鬆途、再加某錢兌業代津帮傾吐、故港帮雖未改變其一貫作風、然吸胃已不若上二日之健、而一般本帮散戶因假期伊邇、大多抱定暫懷觀望政策、故市勢遂鬆懈向下、結果軋小十八元、惟晨開尚平爲四千一百六十元、與昨日不分榮辱、嗣有津帮猛塞、加以外滙稍形硬化、且證券帮亦來市吐出、雖其時港帮進胃尚佳、終因寡不敵衆、故遂盤小至四千一百四十元低價、旋以港帮仍未肯示弱、再委某錢兌業在拖、再賴證券帮亦來復進、故曾回起十三元、惟未幾津帮復來力售、再以買風不繼、是以午收祇有四千一百四十二元、午後情况平凡、雖證券帮重來撈人、但仍難挽疲勢、迄至晚收、仍與午收相同、全天交易約二千兩有餘、銀樓飾金呆定、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤津帮狡猛塞</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開局勢尚平、首由證券帮售予錢兌業三十兩、仍爲四千一百六十元、少頃錢兌業某號突代津帮傾吐、雖港帮乘機委某金號等代吸、但供求仍難平衡、且以滙市略呈鬆態、撳小十元、錢兌業吐予金號二十兩、爲四千一百五十元、後某銀樓亦代客撈進、回起四元、進錢兌業三十兩、爲四千一百五十四元、其時外匯稍扳硬、且證劵帮賣風重起、加以錢兌業繼代津帮塞出、又步小十四元、證券帮賣予銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千一百四十元、此後某錢兌業買興突濃、力進二百餘兩、同時證券帮亦來復進、遂又回高十三元、錢兌業進銀樓帮金號共四十兩、爲四千一百五十三元、旋因某錢兌業重代港帮猛塞、且買方進胃已弱、遂再下降十一元、某錢兌業賣予同業五十兩、爲四千一百四十二元作午收價、午後首開撳低二元、某銀號出證券帮十兩、爲四千一百四十元、後證券帮續來購入、抬起八元、錢兌業互做二十兩、爲四千一百四十八元、入後匯市略硬、銀樓帮等稍吐、遂步小六元、銀樓帮出金號二十兩、爲四千一百四十二元作晚收價、結果比上日軋小十八元、全天二十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减小二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均　成交、</p>

<h3>紗花　當局統制物價　四川紗價　較滬為廉</h3>
<p>上日趨升之紗市、昨則又呈停頓之象、此因實需愈覺靜寂、客帮辦意闌珊、至於內地當局、對於物價加厲統制、故四川紗價不及上海之高、所以銷路一層、難以發展、加之年關將近、例有一度結束、惟一般皮球交易依然與奮、市塲尚稱熱閙、然實際無法進展也、於是遂呈趦趄不前之象也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開承上日堅挺之氣被進、且有一部份喊價甚高、二支雙馬開價爲七百三十九元、此價一開、因連升兩日、一般經營者皆抱賣出主義、所以堅昂之氣、一變軟弱而返趨下風矣、旋即又聞外匯放長、人氣更鬆、市價步開步落至七百三十元收盤、査半日間成交統計一千八百九十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌一元半、天女跌三元、今日有棉紗三十六件運烟台、二百五十件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、同行一、七七〇、內地四〇　香港四五寗波　一五　福州一〇　雪南一五統計一、八九五</p>
<h3>年關將近　棉市沉寂</h3>
<p>本棉交易仍屬寥寥　　、此因年關日近、商業方面尚有一度結束、故同行互相買賣、亦暫束手、至於廠方因棉紗實際消化不健、對於原料亦不搜羅、因之市面仍在岐途徬徨之中也、蘇北來源、計通花二千六百五十三包、常陰沙四百十七包、北沙來一百六十包、效將現棉淸形列左、</p>

<p>近日長江下游北沙方面之棉花、因受意外之阻撓、不得運滬、故進口寥寥、昨日下午四時進口之英輪愛立浦（譯音）號、由孟買運來大量棉花、計四千四百噸的一萬六千餘件、該輪停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、聞該項印棉、多數係日商所購買、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初仍因一部份之南方套賣而跌、後又因同業交易之繁夥、及海外棉商之在市購買、市况忽而轉堅、棉價猛騰、結果收盤價格較之上日漲起二十餘磅音、印度漲六羅比、埃及漲二十餘磅音、利物浦漲九便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉俱因聖誕及新年將屆、各方擬暫時作一結束、故各方殊爲　寂也、同業間所買之紐約交易所期貨買賣、日前獲利了結者甚多、然昨日起已見靜寂、彼等擬渡過聖誕後、再定去留也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙七元六二五折合送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>暴露和諷刺</h3>
<p>— 聞歌</p>
<p>龐大的現實世界，有崇高，也有卑鄙；有光明，也有卑鄙；有光明，也有黑暗。對於崇高的光明的固然需要指示和頌揚，對於卑鄙的黑暗的也不能遺忘了暴露和諷刺。指示頌揚的目的在鼓勵我們繼續向前進晨，暴露諷刺的重心則在提高我們的警覺性。</p>
<p>嚴格地說來，所謂暴露，所謂諷刺，在刻劃的程度上是微有不同的；大概前者比較明白激烈，後者比較含蓄溫和。但這並非是說，兩者可以機械地分開，實際它們時常是配合地運用的。如魯迅先生底阿Q正傳，內中有深刻地暴露崩潰的封建社會的醜態的畫面，也有婉轉地諷刺一味投機的人們的話。</p>
<p>從前好像有人把暴露諷刺看作揭人陰私和謾罵過。其實後者不過是一種『潑婦罵街』而已。暴露諷刺的發生決不會事出無因，這個根基——便是現實。</p>
<p>為了把這種手段運用得極其正確起見，我們不能僅以揭破各種醜惡的表面為滿足，而應該以犁庭掃穴的精神直搗它們的核心；只有粉碎它們的核心，纔會使醜惡根本動搖。</p>
<p>如果從歷史上的趨勢看，好的暴露諷刺常常是典型的，而不是冰結在所謂『人身攻擊』上面，如龔察洛夫（Concharov）底奧薄洛摩夫（Oboomov）魯迅底阿Q和西萬提斯底唐吉訶德。</p>
<p>我記得曾有一位先生這麼說：『典型的創造是文藝上一貫的光榮傳說。判斷一篇小說或戲劇的價值高下，典型創造的成功與失敗，常是一個標準。』誠然，要暴露諷刺獲得有效的影響，少兜圈子起見，對於觸到的卑鄙黑暗，應該先從各種各樣的現象和本質中，抽取具有共通性的特徵，塑成典型，然後再加以突擊。</p>
<p>自從抗戰以後，文學上歌頌光明崇高的題材是急劇增多了，不少作家多從事於這一方面的描寫，這實在是對而又對的事。只是有人竟從此引出結論說：『在這個偉大的時代沒有來臨的時候，我們天天的盼望；如今盼望到了，自然應該痛快地去歌頌它才對。若還膠著於暴露諷刺上面，那不但辜負了這個可以歌頌的時代，並且還會動搖一部人的信心。』那却是稍嫌武斷了雖然說這話的人的用意是可以說句『赤心為國』的，但我以為現在的局勢誠然非常明朗，可是那些反動腐化的勢力却仍舊還存在着，必須加以痛擊，所以為了免去後顧之憂，使我們的歌頌的根基更加穩固起見，我們只有出以暴露和諷刺的姿態予以肅清。</p>
<h3>夜會—刦灰拾記—</h3>
<p>— 唐韋</p>
<p>天漸漸的向晚了，冷風在簷頭上擦出乾燥的響聲，夜幕深沉的，敵意的，向窗口上擁擠。</p>
<p>成衣匠的母親是一個四十多歲，大高個子的女人，她總是苦皺着眉頭，好像剛剛停住哭泣的一樣，臉上尋不到一絲歡悅成份。她忙迫的在房間裏來回兜轉，然而每到一處，只不必要的用手一摸就走開了。</p>
<p>成衣匠是一個和他母親完全沒有相像的年輕小伙子，他生的很美，說話的時候，臉上總是撲着一股熱刺刺的笑容；我們坐在他們的臥室兼廚房的小房間裏，室內除了燈光之外，床鋪，餐具，桌子，凳子，是一個顏色的昏黑。</p>
<p>等那個滿臉大鬍子的工人來了之後，我們的夜會開始了。</p>
<p>成衣匠倒滿五碗白水，挨着小學教員坐下去。教員身體很小，帶着一副很重的近視鏡；他像貓呌一般的報告一個月來，正陽河區教育界反×工作的狀況。</p>
<p>大鬍子把碩健的胸脯緊緊靠在桌子角上，目不轉睛的望着教員掀動的嘴唇。另外一個骨瘦如柴的女朋友，她離開桌子較遠，因為身體太孱弱，一會兒緊緊眉頭，一會兒偎動偎動。</p>
<p>超初成衣的母親，彷彿靡有留心到我們的動作；等大鬍子報告的時候，她湊近他的背後，在那哭喪的罩起一層不容易解釋的神秘。</p>
<p>『嗨，你說的響一點！』</p>
<p>大鬌子往前伸探着，聲音更加低沉了。</p>
<p>我看看她，再窘苦的看看成衣匠。</p>
<p>『不要緊，她聽不見！』成衣匠低聲的回答我。</p>
<p>她的耳朵很聾，是我早就知道的，但心裏却不知道為什麼老是煩厭她。</p>
<p>過了一會兒。</p>
<p>『操，大點聲怕什麼？』</p>
<p>她用手指頭在大鬌子的脊背一頂，氣惱的走開了。</p>
<p>女朋友報告的很簡單，並且有許多話，都近於荒淡，沒有根據，我們批評她『滯工』，經過大家商討以後，就決定再找一位女朋友來幫佐她。</p>
<p>接下去我們討論我們預先決定讀的那一本書，先由成衣匠報告一個提綱，然後根據他的提綱展開討論，有時很順利的進行，有時候就爭執得面紅耳赤；後來終於得到了結論。</p>
<p>——諸位的意見並沒有衝突，只是說的是問題的兩方面，歸攏起來，就是一個完全的答案。</p>
<p>把帶來的報紙分給他們，散會的時候已經十一時點多了。</p>
<p>『你有要洗的衣服，明天送來吧！』臨走成衣匠的母親，叮嚀大鬍子。</p>
<h3>致生活慨歎者</h3>
<p>— 康民</p>
<p>那天碰到你，你的確憔悴得多了！在你的年青的面孔上，一種難熬的生活的鞭笞的暗影，可以明顯地給人看出來。我真為你難過，我同情你。</p>
<p>你說了許多苦惱的話給我聽，像女人訴說她的苦狀似地傾述着。這使我很吃驚。想起在抗戰之前，你是個多麼執拗而堅强的人呵！你從不向人訴說你的生活的苦楚的，你總是昂起你的蓬髮的頭，清瘦的面龐上，一種年青人應有的傲慢的容神，從這裏，給人看出一種朝氣，使人愛你，不從你的破舊的衣衫，而從你的年青人的朝氣呵！</p>
<p>可是昨天我見了你那種如乞丐般的訴苦的情狀後，我只是可憐你。真是對不起得很，我像可憐一個乞丐般的可憐你！我甚至內心湧起一種卑薄你的感情來。</p>
<p>你告訴我：你的生產是怎樣的痛苦，你的老婆時常病着，你的孩子又是怎樣的貪吃，見了鄰家小同伴吃肉吃魚，他也就吵着要吃。你可憐你的孩子，可是也發怒你的孩子。結果，一種生活的痛苦激怒了你，你狠毒地打了你的孩子了，過後，你又後悔，你抱着孩子哭了起來，把衣箱中僅有的幾件衣服送進了典當去，來買肉買魚給孩子吃。可是在吃肉吃魚的時候，你也貪饞，你竟跟你的孩子爭着吃那些難得上口的『佳肴』了！</p>
<p>唉，什麼竟使你變得那樣的人呢？你竟一點也不知羞地說着那些可憐的話。我看見你的還笨的眼睛中飽含着兩眶的淚水。這不是我殘酷，對人不表一點同情，尤其是你，可說是情如手足的老朋友了，可是當時我的確有點對你皺眉呢</p>
<p>你又發起牢騷來了，說是一個國立大學的學生，現在當一個每點鐘三有錢的中學教員，而又到處受人卑薄。你揮了揮你的骨瘦稜稜的手兒，看樣子，是要擊破一種什麼東西似的，可是接着，你又慨歎起你的生活的痛苦來了：『真不是人所過的生活！簡直是豬也不如呵！』</p>
<p>老友！你的擴張的性格，現在變得這末的卑怯，我是覺得什麼東西把你變成那樣的！可是，你這是倔强起來的好，因為你到處慨歎你的生活的痛苦，你的生活還是痛苦的，不會因為你的慨歎而生活變好起來的呀！</p>
<p>高爾基給一個叫P·A托拉文的青年的信說：『不要慨歎生活的痛苦——慨歎是弱者！……』我曾經也有過一個時候，向人慨歎過自己生活的痛苦的，可是得到的是什麼呢？是空洞的虛偽的安慰，而又從這些空洞的虛偽的安慰中，我看出人們對我的卑薄來。後來談到高爾基的這些話來，使我覺察到『人們必須尊敬自己，必須帶着誇耀向一切人說：我是像你一樣的人……』是的，只有這樣，人才會尊敬不卑薄我們呵！</p>
<p>現在是應該吃苦的時候，我們一定要熬過這個痛苦的階段！你不看見麼？黎明的光輝已經在不遠的前面照亮出來了！雖然這光亮還只是一點滴，可是只要我們咬緊牙關，不向痛苦的生活慨歎，我們要像伏爾加的船夫一樣，唱着那悲壯的曲子，向前邁進，這一點滴的光亮，將會照亮你我，不，全個中國人民的生活的呀！</p>
<p>不要慨歎您的生活的痛苦吧！</p>
<h3>悼貫華</h3>
<p>— 硌砂</p>
<p>如果說：在戰鬥的人間，感情尚不能全然為血腥湮滅，那便對於戰友之死的深沉的哀痛。貫華：我那早被忘却了的眼淚，今天遙遙地為你吞咽。</p>
<p>打開塵封着的舊日歲月，那一長列曾為友情踱過的道路，被紫色的血痕腐蝕了的記憶仍然是那麼鮮明，却再不能以冷靜的思維綴起。</p>
<p>那是你！一步一步跨近了真理的碑石，又艱難地去掘動刑棘的根株，然後面對了當路的崖壁用生命作了響亮的一擊。——有一個金色的平野，有一道小河，那便是你生命的脚步長駐的所在。秋天的荒郊是那麼寒冷，却又是收獲的季節，每一顆肥碩的榖粒上該都染着你的血。某一個場面在我心上劃，彷彿見到了停止了呼吸的你躺倒在凝凍的寒烟裏，可依然鐵顎似的倔强地昂直了頭……</p>
<p>彷彿，又見到了你最後的躍動，仍是那麼激情的聲音呼呌着：『來，握起我的槍！……』</p>
<p>是的，要握起你遺下的槍！地下火嘶嘶的爆響即是有力的誓言！</p>
<p>你看，這便是來為你復仇的浩浩蕩蕩的隊伍，行動你墓前垂下了殷紅的戰旗。（却酬）</p>
<h3>耶穌降生與社會（續）</h3>
<p>（五）迷途之羊得歸回　當第一世紀之初葉，猶太亡於羅馬帝國主義之手，政治與宗教，都腐敗黑暗，民衆困苦失望，流離失所，如迷羊沒有牧人，耶穌那至善的牧人，降生此世，原為尋找迷羊而拯救之，常與罪人為友，招呼罪人歸來，衪說：健康之人不用醫生，我來不是召義人，乃是召罪人以得救。耶穌每見流亡之衆，就憐憫他們，因為他們如羊無牧，於是為他們治病，給他們講道，餉以生命之糧，那一般貧窮，患病墮落，以及無告之民，都喜接近耶穌來受衪的安撫與教訓，且有火坑中之妓女，亦投奔耶穌，以斯超拔，盡其所有以奉獻耶穌，表示感謝之心，淳子回家之諭，淫婦悔改之事，都是拯救亡羊之寫照，我國自蒙戰禍以來，各地難民殘兵，寡婦孤兒，瘡痍滿目無完膚，加以政治荒廢，盜匪乘刦，失業貧窮，朝不保暮，民不聊生，社會動搖，希望耶穌降臨，大施憐憫，對我們說：我來了，是要使你們得生命，並且得更豐盛的生命。</p>
<p>（六）使被擄的得釋放　耶穌是反對戰爭的，尤其是反對侵略的戰爭，因為衪說：人類是同胞，天下是一家，豈可自相殘殺？『一家一國自相分爭，必定敗亡』，大家彼此相愛，才能永生，世界有了不平等，社會有了惡制度，人類有了自私心，於是有侵略，有壓迫的戰事，造成地獄的形狀，耶穌降世為要將地獄改為天堂所以反對戰爭反對不平等，種種惡制度，要重整道德，提高人格，對侵略者說：那被擄的人，是你們的同胞，應當優待，還其自由的主權，你們以為自是戰勝國，但不可恃强驕傲，應當輔助弱小的民族，不輔助他們，已失了你們的天職，若侵略而擄掠他們那是什麼心肝呢？·（待續）</p>

<h3>由小女的讀書·聯想到　蘇聯的兒童劇塲（上）</h3>
<p>— 李斐叔</p>
<p>看到報上生活指數的今昔比較表，又回想到我現在處境的艱困，再加之「賢中饋」的不善事家人生產，不覺慄慄危懼，若將墮於深淵！祗好拿出希特勒的手腕，立刻下令將小家庭解散！遣她下鄕去住，而由我暫行兼攝「孩子的母親」之職。從宿雨新啨，烟波浩渺，好像「好夢初醒正在欠伸」的歇浦江上駕了一葉扁舟送別回來，手挈着這有父母幾如無父母的女孩兒李寗，徘徊　踢於長浜路上，腦海中縈迴的是「今後寗的敎育問題」。思來想去，總是得不到妥善的辦法！想把她送到學校寄宿罷？這筆費用，恐非我這久賦閒居的「寄生蟲」所能籌措！何况現代的敎育，—尤其是在孤島上—什九是以金錢作教育之肥料。法幣多兩塊，功課便多兩門，像我輩淸寒人家的子北，對此「商業化的學店」，祗好望洋興嘆而已！</p>
<p>因此，我聯想到往年隨同　浣華先生游歷蘇聯時，所見義務敎育之普及，更迴想到當時參觀兒童劇塲的景况。　我走在大世界左近破舊書攤之前時，在那一束木刻版的碑帖之中，我出一卷「飛影閣畫報」。次序雜亂，散失不全，多約二百餘頁。花了一元代價，便把牠買回來了。—飛影閣畫報爲吳人周慕喬元和吳嘉猷等所作。周慕喬初爲「點石齋畫報」圖繪，有聲於時。嘗應曾忠襄公之召，繪平定粵匪功臣戰蹟圖，進呈御覽，頗邀稱賞。飛影閣畫報，創始於光緒庚寅九月，距今已五十年，所繪皆當時各地新聞，里巷景物，及仕女裝束等。—</p>
<p>在這一卷畫報中，恰巧有一頁是畫的傀儡戲，—太平歡樂園之八—觀衆中無一成年男丁，全是婦人孺子。我們在蘇聯所參觀的兒童劇塲，所演的也是傀儡戲。大概所有的一切傀儡戲，是祗可供婦孺階級的欣賞罷？（原圖附印於上）</p>

<p>談起白玉霜來上海人士有着甚深的印象，她是蹦蹦戲的名角，自二十五年三月間，在北平演唱淫戲至遭市府當局驅逐出境後，旋即携帶全班人馬來滬獻藝，因為這種戲十分吻合上海一般人的胃口，所以在各戲院登台時，頗極一時之盛，接着還攝製了一部以蹦蹦戲為題材的影片「海棠紅」，由白擔任主角。因爲成績尚好，所以頗能賣座。當時白曾接連在恩派亞戲院登台數月，而在某夜，白突然偕琴師顧寶奎私奔赴津，於是戲院因合同尚未期滿，所以與白之阿兄曾一度涉訟法庭，雖然戲　佔了勝訴，但主角已遠走高飛，所以也祗得以不了了之。白抵津後，即繼續在舊館翠香樓及冷香園賣藝。而量近消息傳來，說白已於止月某日在北平新雅酒樓正式結婚了，但新郎却不是這位一同私奔的琴師，而是當地富商朱虹奎的兒子，結婚的那天的確轟動了整個故都的人士，現在自己決定從此謝絕粉墨生涯了。</p>

<h3>Hubei-China Army Occupies Two Strongholds South of Zhongxiang; Japanese Troops in the Area Retreat to Jingshan; Qianjiang County Under Siege</h3>
<p>Changde:  The Chinese army continues to make progress in various battles in central Hubei. The Japanese troops in Zhongxiang have suffered heavy losses under fierce attacks from various Chinese units. Military supplies have been transported to the rear for days, and a large number of Japanese soldiers have also retreated towards Jingshan. Only a small number of remaining Japanese troops are holding the city walls, seemingly waiting for an opportunity to escape. The two strongholds of Gaojiaji and Weijiaji, south of Zhongxiang, were captured and completely occupied by the Chinese army yesterday morning. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in disarray towards Jiukou. The Japanese troops at Luojiadu Ferry attempted to invade but were defeated by the Chinese army.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Adjustment of General Living Problems</h3>
<p>Since the Rice Market, characterized by monopolistic hoarding, speculation, and seizure, has been brought under control by the authorities of the two concessions, the tumultuous livelihood of the people has finally seen some improvement. By disallowing speculative manipulation, the waters are calmed, and the market naturally returns to stability. However, it is important to remember that the manipulation of the Rice Market originated only in recent months. There must be a cause and an opportunity for it. The manipulation of the Rice Market is related to the soaring prices of all goods and exacerbated by plunder and obstruction; otherwise, rice merchants would not be able to hoard even if they wanted to. Therefore, to ensure a stable livelihood, it is not enough to merely restrict the rise in rice prices. All daily necessities that hold the same importance as rice should also be subject to price stabilization measures. Furthermore, all obstructions that affect the livelihood of the people should be jointly addressed to find solutions. Otherwise, even the current small improvement will not last, let alone stability.</p>
<p>To stabilize prices, the flow of goods must be unimpeded. The current problem lies precisely in the lack of smooth transportation. This lack of smoothness disrupts the balance of supply and demand, causing price fluctuations. Amidst these fluctuations, cunning individuals seize the opportunity for profit. Speculators and traders swarm like flies to carrion, gathering everywhere, seeking to breed and spread their harmful influence. Unless they are swept away with a fly swatter, they will endanger the survival of the masses. Therefore, speculative manipulation of daily necessities must be prohibited. Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated measures to crack down on the hoarding of daily necessities, providing a basis for cracking down in Shanghai. Punishing one as a warning to all has proven effective. Before the Municipal Council cracked down on the manipulation of the Rice Market, oil prices soared, and flour prices rose daily. After the prohibition order was enforced rigorously without leniency and proved resistant to both influence and coercion, other industries and goods became apprehensive and changed their ways. For example, hoarded soybean oil dropped by twenty yuan in the open market the other day, and the desire to raise flour prices faltered. Isn't this a clear indication of the effectiveness of cracking down on manipulation? As for the transportation problem, it is naturally not as smooth during wartime as it is during peacetime. However, the lack of smooth transportation in Shanghai, although influenced by the war, is not truly caused by the war. Shanghai and its surrounding areas within hundreds of miles have not experienced formal warfare for over a year. Some say that the Japanese military, in an attempt to curry favor with the United States, has agreed to open the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which will make the transportation of daily necessities, especially rice, more convenient than before. Whether the "opening" will actually be implemented has already been commented on by this newspaper. Recent events further underscore this point. While the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have expressed their cooperation in alleviating the rice panic in Shanghai, countless rice boats detained in the villages around Shanghai and hundreds of rice-transporting vehicles blocked at inland train stations remain. Who is responsible for this, and who ordered it? This shows that the transportation problem will not be easily solved simply by opening the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Nevertheless, the situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. Shanghai is a special international market, and everyone should fulfill their responsibility to protect it. However, goods purchased from the interior are frequently detained, and daily necessities are often intercepted. If Shanghai residents cannot sustain their lives, they will inevitably abandon Shanghai. Then, how can Shanghai maintain its abnormal prosperity? If Shanghai residents cannot afford to sustain their lives due to high prices and cannot afford to move elsewhere, who can guarantee that they will not resort to desperate measures? Will Shanghai still be able to maintain its perfect order, and will commerce and industry still be able to maintain their normal operations? Therefore, if various countries have not forgotten the Chinese market, they must cooperate to ensure the smooth transportation in the Shanghai area. Moreover, they should jointly devise effective methods to regulate and stabilize the supply and demand of daily necessities in Shanghai, so as to achieve the goal of balancing and stabilizing prices. Maintaining the stable livelihood and market prosperity of Shanghai residents is not only a matter of their welfare. Protecting Shanghai today, to await the resurgence of a "free China," will ensure that we all share in boundless prosperity and happiness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, matters that are closely related to the lives of the masses include the charges for water, electricity, and public transportation. High charges will increase the burden on everyone, regardless of wealth. Regarding electricity, the cost, excluding the permanent equipment such as machinery, boilers, poles, and wires, consists only of coal and water. As for water, excluding the permanent equipment such as boilers, machinery, buried water pipes, water storage pools, and water towers, the only cost is electricity. The water source is vast and limitless, costing nothing. Electric trams rely on electricity to power their vehicles, in addition to the permanent equipment such as vehicles and tracks. Moreover, as a result of alternating current, electricity consumption is limited. For buses, the only cost besides the vehicles is gasoline. Other expenses, such as building repairs, equipment, and wages, are also costs, but they should be considered separately. The purchase and installation of fixed assets are not new, and any additions are a result of business development and should be limited. Therefore, fixed assets should not be revalued at the current currency value to seek excessive profits. Moreover, because of the heavy equipment involved and the fact that it is a public utility, excessive charges should not be allowed. The right to monopolize business is granted to prevent competition, so the protection is comprehensive. What is the actual cost of one unit of electricity, and what is the selling price? From what we have heard, the cost was extremely low before the war. Therefore, the charges for power and heat are much lower than those for lighting, and there are preferential graduated pricing schemes for large users, yet profits are still made. Thus, the application of electricity in the concessions is vast, and the benefits are evident. Even if coal prices are high and labor costs have slightly increased, why is it necessary to repeatedly raise prices, exceeding the usual levels by more than double, just to maintain the expected profits? Regarding water, electricity costs may have slightly increased, but there are special agreements in place, so the increase will not be as significant as for the general public. The situation for trams and water companies is similar. As for automobiles, the price of gasoline is high, and prices have already been raised repeatedly. There must be a reason for the increase in the price of goods. Furthermore, the increase in prices for public utilities must be approved by the Municipal Council before it can be implemented. The Municipal Council must stand on a fair and impartial standpoint. On the one hand, it should protect the interests of the operators of public utilities, and on the other hand, it must deeply consider the extremely difficult and impoverished lives of Shanghai citizens. To slightly ease the burden on the public, investors should be allowed to reduce their profits somewhat. Taking from the long to make up for the short is an expedient measure. Moreover, in a world filled with turmoil, those who invest in Shanghai should exercise self-restraint to adapt to the times. Monopolized businesses are not comparable to ordinary commerce and industry and should not focus solely on profit. Therefore, it is hoped that an appropriate opportunity will arise in the future to re-examine the charges for water, electricity, and public transportation.</p>
<p>What threatens Shanghai residents the most is the increasing rent. Property owners are now also using the excuse of high prices to create various pretexts for raising rents. We believe that the inevitable price increases in various industries are justified only for newly acquired assets and newly produced goods, as the costs are high and require compensation. However, for non-newly constructed houses, even if prices are high, not only is the cost the same as before, but the value of the property has also increased invisibly due to the price increases. It is absolutely unacceptable to take advantage of the situation or focus solely on temporary monetary values to oppress tenants. However, the reality is that the general real estate industry is focusing on how to raise rents. As rents become higher, subletting increases, stacking beds and building structures on top of each other, creating a suffocating environment. This is no less than hell, let alone sanitary. This is what we must urgently appeal to the owners of mansions and large buildings. All of these realities are related to the prosperity or decline of the lives of the masses, the safety of social order, and the quality of public health. It is hoped that the authorities of the concessions will seek the welfare of the majority of citizens, properly adjust general living problems, and thereby maintain the prosperity of the concessions.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Grew Receives New Instructions, U.S. and Japan Continue Diplomatic Negotiations: Japanese Government Officials Host Financial and Media Circles, Requesting Understanding Regarding the Lifting of the Yangtze River Navigation Ban</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The fourth meeting between Saburo Nomura and Joseph Grew to adjust relations between Japan and the United States was held at the Foreign Minister's official residence from 5 p.m. today. Ambassador Grew held instructions from his government and met with Foreign Minister Nomura. First, Ambassador Grew stated that the United States government sincerely intends to address the unfortunate incidents Japan has caused in China. The Japanese government's promise to the U.S. government and its people to partially open the Yangtze River has been well-received by Americans. Therefore, the U.S. deeply trusts the Japanese government's actions regarding future measures. Ambassador Grew further stated that the U.S. government hopes to restore the traditional friendly relations between the two countries with the same enthusiasm as Japan desires. Therefore, regarding the handling of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Navigation and Commerce, the U.S. is eager to seize opportunities in the near future to prevent any hindrance to trade relations after the treaty expires on January 26 and to take continued measures. Regarding the revision of the treaty, preparations will be made to promote friendly relations between the U.S. and Japan in a spirit of mutual assistance. Foreign Minister Nomura immediately replied that he deeply appreciated the U.S. government's willingness to adjust U.S.-Japan relations with Japan's sincerity. He hopes to work together on concrete construction plans for friendly relations between the two countries at the next meeting. The meeting adjourned with a handshake at 6:25 p.m. (Kyodo News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Political figures here have paid close attention to and speculated about the meeting between U.S. Ambassador Grew and Foreign Minister Nomura at 5:30 p.m. today. However, they expressed doubt as to whether the meeting would yield any concrete results. Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the U.S. Embassy remained silent on the matter. However, according to the "Asahi Shimbun," the U.S. Ambassador will express the U.S. government's views on Japan's proposal to reopen the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. The U.S. Ambassador will likely inquire about the details of the opening period and conditions and reiterate the U.S. government's insistence that other issues between the U.S. and Japan should be resolved. The newspaper believes that the issue of fundamentally adjusting U.S.-Japan relations may also be raised and discussed constructively. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Tokyo report: Prime Minister Abe invited representatives from eight major Japanese newspapers and news agencies to the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday afternoon.

Foreign Minister Nomura, Home Minister Ohara, Finance Minister Aoki, Army Minister Hata, and Navy Minister Yoshida also attended. Before hosting the press representatives, Foreign Minister Nomura invited fourteen representatives from the financial community to lunch at the Foreign Minister's official residence, where Nomura explained everything regarding the U.S.-Japan diplomatic negotiations, the government's decision to open the Yangtze River, and other diplomatic issues. (News report on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura stated to several influential leaders of the Japanese financial community yesterday afternoon, "The work of dealing with the China Incident is now making good progress, and there are slight signs of improvement in the U.S. attitude toward Japan. The opening of the Yangtze River to the shipping of third countries will affect your interests in the area. However, from the long-term perspective of national policy, the Yangtze River must be opened. Therefore, I hope that you will endure temporary inconvenience and strive forward to realize Sino-Japanese economic cooperation." (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma confidently predicted today that the U.S. response to Japan's declaration on opening the Yangtze River will be delivered to Japan before Christmas or "today." He said that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horinouchi has not reported to the Japanese government on the U.S. response to Japan's declaration, but "we have good reason to hope to receive a response from the Washington government." When reporters asked what form the U.S. response would take, Suma replied, "The U.S. response will still express that country's attitude toward Japan's declaration." Suma expressed disappointment at the news from Shanghai, where news sources expressed skepticism about Japan's declaration and demanded that the Yangtze River be opened as far as Hankou. He said that guerrillas are active near Nanjing, and due to military needs, the opening of the Yangtze River can only extend to Nanjing. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Soviet Aircraft Conduct Large-Scale Bombing of Finland, Three Hospitals and a Passenger Train Attacked: Red Army's Plan to Cut Off Finland Has Failed</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Today is the fifteenth day of the Red Army's attack on the Mannerheim Line. Not only has it failed to break through the line, but its attack strength is not as formidable as it was three days ago. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Soviet army's offensive to cut Finland in two was repelled by Finnish forces on the northeast front last night. Finnish forces are currently fighting back fiercely. Soviet forces are currently retreating in several locations. It is expected that the Soviet army will launch a more vigorous attack. On the northern front, due to the extremely cold weather, the fighting has stalled. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Yesterday afternoon, Soviet aircraft attacked Helsinki. Three hospitals were hit by bombs. Soviet aircraft, on the occasion of Stalin's birthday, carried out attacks along the southern coast of Finland, from Poku, 30 miles east of Helsinki, to Abo, 100 miles west of Helsinki. The surgical room of a hospital in Helsinki was performing surgery when it was suddenly hit by a bomb. Also bombed were the Convent of Mercy and the Hospital for the Blind. Bombs also fell near the Army Hospital and the Red Cross temporary hospital. Twelve Soviet aircraft attacked Helsinki, two of which were shot down. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Officials have announced that six Soviet aircraft attacked a passenger train in southern Finland. Passengers disembarked and fled, but were strafed by machine guns, resulting in two deaths and two injuries. Several other Soviet aircraft bombed residents in a town and strafed a passenger train with machine guns. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters military correspondent reports that, in fact, the Soviet army did not intend to wage a large-scale war in Finland. The Russian General Staff apparently thought that it could drive straight into Finland, but unexpectedly, due to insufficient initial preparation, it could not achieve its goal. Most of the Soviet tanks captured by the Finnish army had run out of fuel. It can be seen that the Soviet Union was not fully prepared beforehand. Now that the weather is extremely cold, it is advantageous to the Finnish army. Both sides feel that they cannot fight a major battle in the heavy snow. The Soviet plan to cross the Finnish "waist" and head to Poseenia is unlikely to be realized until the snow melts in the spring. Due to the extremely cold weather on the northern front, there will be no progress in the winter. As for the Mannerheim Line, the most important Finnish fortification system, even if there is fighting, it will likely be sporadic. The delay in the war is to Finland's advantage because the supply of money and weapons can at least come in steadily, and its army can rest or reorganize. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Leningrad Military District Headquarters issued a war report yesterday stating that there was intense artillery fire on the Karelian Isthmus front. There was contact with reconnaissance outposts elsewhere. Soviet aircraft conducted reconnaissance of various locations on the front lines.

<h3>Pope Scheduled to Reciprocate Visit of Italian King, An Act of Historical Significance</h3>
<p>Vatican City: The Italian King and Queen visited Pope Pius XII yesterday. The Pope praised the Italian King, saying, "During this time of war, Italy has been able to maintain peace." The King and Queen presented gifts to the Pope, who in return presented the King with a set of extremely valuable ancient Vatican coins and the Queen with a string of golden rosary beads. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome: Pope Pius XII is scheduled to return the visit of the Italian King and Queen on the 28th of this month. Before Rome was occupied by French forces in 1870, the Pope had returned the visit of the Italian King. From 1870 until 1929, the Pope never left the Vatican. All ceremonies for reciprocating visits to foreign heads of state were represented by the Cardinal. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Vatican City: Pope Pius XII has decided to personally return the visit to Rome. Vatican officials say that this move is of historical significance and politically important. Since the Italian army occupied Rome in 1870, successive Popes have never personally visited the Italian Royal Palace. Pius XII's decision to personally return the visit nearly confirms that the Vatican and the Italian state have buried the hatchet. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Germany and Romania Sign Commercial Agreement</h3>
<p>Specifying Trade Quantities and Currency Exchange Rates, Crude Oil Exports to Germany Limited to 130,000 Tons Per Month</p>
<p>Bucharest: Commercial negotiations between Germany and Romania concluded yesterday with the signing of a commercial agreement. The following communique was issued:</p>
<p>The committee responsible for negotiating German-Romanian commercial relations between the governments of Germany and Romania held a meeting in Bucharest, which concluded on the 21st. In a friendly and understanding atmosphere, the meeting discussed the exchange of goods and payment methods. To develop the exchange of goods between the two countries, the two countries' committees will reset the exchange rate of the two countries' currencies. From January 1, one mark will be exchanged for 49 Romanian lei when Romania purchases goods from Germany, and one mark will be exchanged for 50 Romanian lei when Germany purchases goods from Romania. A transitional measure has now been decided to avoid German and Romanian merchants from suffering losses due to changes in exchange rates. The quantities of crude oil and grains under the new agreement have not been announced. Both Germany and Romania agree to use all means of transportation to increase the amount of exchange of goods. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Germany and Romania formally established a protocol yesterday to determine the quantity of trade and currency exchange rates between the two countries. Regarding crude oil, the amount that Germany purchases from Romania is limited to 130,000 tons per month, which is equivalent to the average amount from January to August of this year. Since the outbreak of the war, the amount of Germany's purchases from Romania has gradually decreased to 80,000 tons per month. In the first half of this month, due to poor rail transportation, it decreased to 33,000 tons. According to the protocol, in addition to purchasing 130,000 tons of oil from Romania each month in the future, the number of imports reduced since September this year due to the outbreak of the war can still be purchased on a monthly basis to make up for the limit, but the total amount, including the 130,000 tons that can be purchased each month, must not exceed 190,000 tons. In addition, an annex to the protocol stipulates that Germany agrees to deposit 40 million marks in the German Bank in Bucharest as a guarantee for the country to pay for the oil.

<h3>Daladier's Speech Expresses Respect for Finland, Still Unyielding After Three Weeks of Resistance, Should Be Aided Based on League of Nations Resolution</h3>
<p>Paris: When the Chamber of Deputies discussed the first-quarter war budget for 1940 this morning, Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech explaining the necessity of fortifications, saying: Although the population of Poland is ten times that of Finland, it collapsed in less than ten days of fighting, while Finland relied on the "Mannerheim Line" to resist for more than three weeks. It is still unyielding, which is proof. "It is not enough for us to only express our respect for the brave country of Finland. We must provide practical assistance. This is what I have realized. I can tell you that since the League of Nations condemned the Soviet Union, we have been fulfilling our responsibilities within a broad scope, and we will continue to fulfill them in the future." At this time, the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party are actively engaged in propaganda, all of which are unreliable and untrustworthy. "Hitler had previously made promises to Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, and then reneged on his promises and took advantage of them by means of trickery and violence." He also said that the German soldiers captured by our side recently on the front lines have been identified as Austrians. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3>Britain Rushes to Build New Fighter Jets, Far Superior to German Aircraft</h3>
<p>London: Well-informed sources have confirmed that Britain is now building new fighter jets that are far superior in quality to the new German-made Messerschmitt 110. (The German Messerschmitt 110 has a speed of 375 kilometers per hour and is equipped with four machine guns and two small cannons. British bomber squadrons fought with more than 20 of these German aircraft when they bombed the German naval base on Heligoland on the 18th of this month. As a result, 12 German aircraft were shot down, and the British lost 7.) The authorities are keeping the structural features secret, but according to air force experts, the speed, firepower, and defense of these new fighter jets cannot be matched by German aircraft, but they may not be built in large numbers in the short term.

<h3>French Government Announces in Yellow Paper the Inside Story of Germany's Annexation of Czechoslovakia: Hitler Coerced Czech President Hácha, No Word of the Conditions for National Subjugation Could Be Altered</h3>
<p>Paris: The Yellow Paper compiled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was published yesterday. The chapter on Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia is based on a confidential report submitted by the former French Ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, on March 17 of this year, which describes in detail the violent methods used by German leader Hitler when "negotiating" agreements with smaller countries. According to Ambassador Coulondre's telegram, Hitler invited Czech President Hácha and Foreign Minister Chvalkovský to Berlin on March 14, not to conduct negotiations, but to issue orders. The next morning, when the two entered Hitler's office, they saw that the agreement drafted by the German side was already placed on the desk. Although Hácha and others made various statements, hoping to revise it, the result was that they could not alter a single word. Hitler then declared to the two arrogantly that if they did not sign, the German army would occupy the Czech capital of Prague on the second day, March 16, at 9 a.m. "Anyone who dares to block the German army's advance will be swept away." After speaking, he took up his pen and signed the agreement, leaving the room silently, with his head held high. The time was 12:30 p.m. on March 15. Hácha and Chvalkovský remained in the office and continued negotiations with the three German representatives. From that time until 4:30 a.m. the next morning, the German representatives continued to use threatening words to force Hácha to sign, lasting a total of 16 hours. During this negotiation time, Hácha, due to his old age and weak health, was repeatedly treated by doctors, but he saw that the future of the Czech nation depended entirely on this moment. Therefore, he still mustered the courage to negotiate with the German side and strongly stated that a white nation subjected to such treatment was unprecedented in history. However, the only response made by the three German representatives was that if they refused to sign, the city of Prague would be destroyed in the morning, and hundreds of German bombers were ready at the airport to carry out this mission at any time. This order will be issued at 6 a.m. on the 16th, so it must be signed before 6 a.m. This agreement to sacrifice Czech independence was finally signed by the exhausted President Hácha to avoid the suffering of his people from air raids, although he and Foreign Minister Chvalkovský had urged the German side to make concessions, all in vain. He was forced to declare that he could not sign after consulting with other cabinet members. However, because the German side knew that the Sudeten German Party and other groups had been deployed in Czechoslovakia, and in order to show that the activities of these groups were effective, they accepted President Hácha's request and allowed him to make a long-distance call to the Czech cabinet conference room. Hácha and Chvalkovský did not know about this long-distance telephone line, which directly connected to the Czech cabinet conference room, and they were stunned. At 4:30 a.m. on the 16th, with only 90 minutes left until the final deadline, the elderly President Hácha finally decided to surrender and sign to save the people of his country from the pain of air raids. Foreign Minister Chvalkovský sighed as he left the conference room, "Our people will curse us, but we have preserved their survival so that they will not be massacred. We can only console ourselves with this. The Czech Republic has thus lost its independent sovereignty." (Havas, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Government Bans Sterling Remittances</h3>
<p>London - A certain financial authority on the Far East, when interviewed by a Reuters reporter today, spoke about the new cabinet order announcing stricter regulations on increasing sterling remittances and listing Hong Kong as a non-sterling area. He said that he believed the order was issued because Hong Kong's defense regulations have been operating too loosely to date, so the new order is meant to tighten them. However, Singapore's defense regulations are strictly followed. Since the outbreak of the war, according to the defense regulations, goods imported into Hong Kong and remittances paid for exported goods have often required permits from the authorities. If the nature of Hong Kong's imports and exports continues legally as before, the new order may not be much different from the past. The only possible difference from the past might be that remittances from the Straits Settlements to Hong Kong, for transfer to China by Chinese people, may be affected by the new order. In other words, these remittances are China's invisible exports. However, the amount of these remittances has been subject to licensing restrictions since the beginning of the war, and there has been no reduction in them so far. It is not expected that they will decrease now. The reporter asked why the Hong Kong dollar, which has always been maintained by sterling reserves in the Straits Settlements, is now being listed as a non-sterling area. The authority replied that attention should be paid to the circulation of the Hong Kong dollar in the South China region, which is very large. In practice, the Hong Kong dollar can largely be regarded as foreign currency. It is now necessary to prevent the danger of someone trying to use the Hong Kong dollar to illegally channel sterling.

<h3>US Congressmen Advocate Building 80,000-Ton Battleships; Is Building 60,000-Ton Capital Ships a Good Idea? House Naval Committee Is Studying It</h3>
<p>Washington - The House Naval Subcommittee is currently studying whether it is advisable to build battleships with a displacement of 65,000 tons. The chairman of the subcommittee, Democratic Congressman Sgro Ru Han, said today that the issue is currently under study. There is no doubt that the U.S. Congress has already approved the funds needed to build two battleships of 40,000 tons each, and construction was originally planned to begin at the beginning of this year, but this move is still being planned. According to members of the subcommittee, the new locks of the Panama Canal can accommodate larger warships, which may be the reason for this. Republican Congressman Mars said, "Forget about 60,000 tons and work on 80,000 tons, and forget about the canal. The United States has two fleets of superior warships that no other country can follow. An 80,000-ton warship can have seven or eight gun turrets and be equipped with 20-inch caliber guns." (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - The Shipyard Administration has recently ordered two floating docks from two shipyards for use at the Pearl Harbor Naval Base in the Hawaiian Islands. One is 305 meters long and can accommodate the largest warships in the U.S. fleet, including the 35,000-ton and 40,000-ton battleships under construction or planned. The other is 152 meters long and is specifically for smaller warships. The total cost is $6,259,000. The factories will start construction in the near future and complete it within three years.

<h3>Multiple Bombings at Post Offices in London; Bombs Concealed in Parcels; Terrorist Acts by IRA</h3>
<p>London - Last night, while sorting Christmas greetings mail at post offices in various districts of London, bombs hidden in parcels exploded in several incidents, injuring several people. The authorities have instructed all post offices to pay attention to this matter. Nine people were slightly injured at the Paddington district post office. Three explosions occurred within one hour at the Ebbervale Street post office, injuring three people and destroying some mail. A bomb was also found in a parcel at the Kingsway post office, but it did not explode. Six explosions occurred within an hour and a half at the Fulham and Stamford Hill post offices, destroying only a small portion of the mail. A parcel also exploded at the Fulham Station. It is estimated that all of this was done by the Irish Republican Army. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>75th Japanese Diet Convened Today; Domestic and Foreign Issues Urgently Need to be Addressed; Political Parties Relying on Others May Not Accomplish Much</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The 75th session of the Japanese Diet is scheduled to be convened tomorrow. It is reported that the urgent issues to be discussed by the Diet at present are: (1) how to resolve the war in China and support Wang Jingwei's organization in order to superficially resolve the war as soon as possible; (2) how to resolve Japan-US relations in order to seek renewal of the Japan-US trade treaty. Other thorny issues that the Diet wants to question the government about are the problem of rising prices, the problem of increased budgets, Japan's attitude toward Britain, the Soviet Union, and the European war. When the Diet opens, the Emperor will personally read the Imperial Rescript. Afterwards, the Diet will adjourn for one or two days, and it will also have to adjourn for a few days during the New Year. Therefore, the actual opening date will be next month. People here generally expect that there will not be major disputes in this session of the Diet. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese Diet has become much more docile. Even the Social Masses Party has become semi-fascist. When the previous Diet session convened, although some members raised rather difficult questions to the government, there was no dissent regarding military policy. Even in terms of the budget, this session of the Diet will at most make slight modifications to unimportant items, and the rest will definitely be passed by a majority. The 1940-41 budget is currently estimated at 10,500,000,000 yen, an unprecedentedly large budget. However, there are also supplementary surcharges, and 70 percent of the budget will go to the army and navy. It is said that the expenses for China affairs are tentatively set at 5,300,000,000 yen, and another huge sum of the same amount is earmarked for enriching national defense, experimental machinery, and long-term construction. According to the results of the past four sessions of the Japanese Diet, military expenditures for China totaling 11,900,000,000 yen have been approved. This amount is seven times greater than the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. However, Army Minister Hata Shunroku is still loudly calling for Japan to continue its efforts to enrich its military preparations in order to prevent unforeseen changes. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese Diet is scheduled to convene tomorrow. Observers predict that there will be unprecedentedly fierce debates during the session, as there have never been so many important internal and external issues in Japanese history that urgently need to be clarified as today. The various political parties are now very active, holding daily meetings to draft their political platforms. The Minseito and Seiyukai parties will cooperate with the government. The political parties believe that the time for the restoration of party government has arrived, so they will do their best to show the people their ability to govern the country. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The 75th ordinary Diet session will open tomorrow. The House of Peers has decided to have its members elect ministers and directors by mutual vote. In the House of Representatives, because Deputy Speaker Kanemitsu Tsuneo has been appointed Minister of Colonial Affairs, a successor will be elected as Deputy Speaker. The House of Peers will adjourn on the 24th, and the House of Representatives will determine the seats and members of the political parties. On the 26th, the opening ceremony will be held. On the 27th, after deciding on the matters to be handled this year, it will announce an adjournment until January 20th of next year, when it will officially deliberate on national affairs.

<h3>French Parliamentarians Advocate Severing Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Peiping - A report from Paris states that right-wing political parties in France are urging the government to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Former Prime Minister Flandin stated in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly that France should immediately sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. French newspapers are paying close attention to Flandin's remarks. An organization of parliamentarians in the National Assembly, calling itself the Democratic Group, passed a resolution in favor of severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The group has 60 parliamentarians and is led by Maran Louis, and also has a force in the lower house that cannot be ignored. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Stalin (Continued)</h3>
<p>On February 23, 1913, Stalin was arrested again in St. Petersburg and exiled to the remote Turukhansk province for four years. In the late summer of 1914, the First Imperialist War broke out, and Stalin's relationship with Lenin and the Party Central Committee was temporarily severed, but Stalin maintained an internationalist stance on the issues of war, peace, and revolution, the same as Lenin. On March 25, 1917, Stalin returned to St. Petersburg, which at that time was the revolutionary capital of Russia. Lenin was still abroad at the time, and Stalin, in this difficult and serious period, united the Bolshevik Party as a recognized party leader to solve new problems.</p>
<p>After Lenin returned to the country, Stalin and Lenin jointly fought against the party rebellion of Kamenev and Zinoviev. After the Party Central Committee meeting in April 1917, Stalin was elected as a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, and has never been interrupted from that time until now. After the July 1917 incident, Lenin was persecuted by the counter-revolutionary provisional government and had to hide in secret locations. Stalin directly directed the Central Committee and central organs of the Party, leading the entire Party and the working class to prepare for the armed uprising of the socialist revolution. In this uprising, Stalin was Lenin's closest comrade-in-arms, directly commanding all preparations. The plan and date of the uprising were personally guided and determined by him. At the same time, he went all out to suppress and resist the destroyers of the October Revolution, Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Rykov.</p>
<p>After the victory of the October Revolution, the All-Russian Congress of Soviets immediately elected the first Council of People's Commissars, with Lenin as chairman and Stalin as one of the commissars, serving as People's Commissar for National Affairs from that time until 1923. Therefore, he was able to directly guide the Party and the Soviet government in all work related to resolving domestic ethnic issues. The "Declaration of Rights of the Peoples of Russia" was drafted by him.</p>
<p>During the Civil War, the Party Central Committee and Lenin personally assigned Stalin to the most important and dangerous front lines in various places. Therefore, Stalin served as a member of the Revolutionary Military Council on the Western Front, Southern Front, and Southwestern Front. In the battles of Tsaritsyn, Perm, Petrograd, the Southern Front, and the resistance against the Polish White Army, Stalin's strategic genius and iron will were the main reasons for the victory of the revolutionary army. Each victory was personally organized and promoted by Stalin. On November 27, 1919, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, on Lenin's proposal, issued an order praising Stalin's achievements on the front lines of the civil war and awarded him the Order of the Red Banner.</p>
<p>After the Soviet Union began peaceful economic construction, Stalin and Lenin jointly led the entire Party in the struggle against the Trotskyists and all other reactionary groups attempting to obstruct the Party from resolving all issues related to domestic economic life. In 1922, on Lenin's recommendation, Stalin was elected as General Secretary of the Party Central Committee.</p>
<p>In 1918, Lenin was assassinated and seriously injured, and his health deteriorated. From the end of 1921, Lenin had to stop working from time to time, and the task of leading the entire Party was assumed by Stalin. During this period, Stalin's work achievements were extremely great. He created the Soviet republics of various nationalities, and then united all the republics to form the sole Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.</p>
<p>After Lenin's death in 1924, Trotsky and his party attempted to deviate from Lenin's path. Stalin exposed Trotsky's true activities and concentrated the entire Party's strength to completely defeat Trotsky.</p>
<p>In 1924, Stalin's theoretical works "The Foundations of Leninism" and "The October Revolution and the Tactics of the Russian Communists" were published. The principles revealed in these two works became the foundation for the Party's resolutions on building socialism in the Soviet Union. Subsequently, industrialization and work were carried out under Stalin's guidance. The creation of all new industrial sectors and the establishment of large factories were mainly promoted by Stalin, and Stalin also regularly paid attention to their construction process.</p>
<p>Under Stalin's leadership, the Party also solved the most difficult task after the proletarian revolution seized power, namely the collectivization of agriculture and the elimination of the last remnants of the exploiting classes of rich peasants. When the Party began its offensive against the kulaks in 1928-29, Bukharin, Rykov, Tomsky, and their reactionary followers openly came forward to oppose the Party's line. Stalin thoroughly exposed these right-wingers, proving that they were the agents of the rich peasants within the Party, and mobilized the entire Party to defeat them.</p>
<p>As a result of the industrial and agricultural transformation, the Soviet national economy has been equipped with the most modern machinery in the world. Industry has countless machines; agriculture has excellent domestically produced tractors, combines, and other machines. The transportation industry also has countless high-quality cars, locomotives, ships, and airplanes. The Red Army has superior equipment—artillery, tanks, airplanes, and warships. This vast and infinite technical transformation was personally guided and completed by Stalin. He paid particular attention to the armament construction of the Red Army, so the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force have become invincible forces. Under Stalin's leadership, millions of talented people have emerged among the people, and the powerful and excellent Stakhanovite movement has spread throughout the country.</p>
<p>The socialist transformation of the entire national economy has resulted in a complete change in domestic class relations. Therefore, the constitution passed in 1924 had to be revised. On Stalin's proposal, the Seventh All-Union Congress of Soviets discussed this issue and decided to organize a constitutional committee chaired by Stalin to draft a new draft constitution. After this draft was discussed nationwide for five and a half months, it was passed by the Eighth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets on December 5, 1936. The people of the entire Soviet Union unanimously called it the Stalin Constitution.</p>
<p>On December 12, 1937, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was elected according to the new constitution. Among the 94 million voters in the country, more than 91 million, or 96.8 percent, voted, of which 90 million unanimously voted for the candidates of the Stalinist Communist Party and the non-Party groups.</p>
<p>In March 1939, Stalin further defined the program for the Soviet Union's further progress toward communism. He designated its main task as catching up with and surpassing all advanced capitalist countries in the economic field within ten to fifteen years. He stated that in an environment surrounded by capitalism, socialist countries must continue to exist and become stronger. (TASS dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>The Battle for Chao'an City; Japanese Troops Stationed in Chao'an City Moved to Southern Fujian; Chinese Troops Took Advantage of the Vacancy to Recover It Once; Japanese Puppet Organs Destroyed, Traitors Captured</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Japanese East Road Commander Ogasawara, in collaboration with the puppet army of Chenghai, Huang Dawei's unit, invaded southern Fujian, leaving the Japanese troops stationed in Chaozhou and Shantou with weak forces. The Japanese and puppet troops in Chao'an City were under the command of Matsune. The Japanese military headquarters was located at the former administrative commissioner's office under Hulu Mountain. The West Gate Station was designated as a military area. From the western suburbs to Chuncheng Tower outside the South Gate, 20 artillery emplacements were built, and communication trenches were dug to connect them, using the two banks of the stagnant creek in the south as the outer line to control the Anjie Road. There was also the Dehua squadron of cavalry artillery, using Fuyang, Wuyang, Yunbu, and Guanchao as strongholds to protect the central section of the railway traffic line, blocking the vanguard of the Chinese army on the front of the Anjie Road, preventing it from crossing east of the railway tracks. Anbu and Caitang are the outer strongholds of the Japanese troops in Shantou, defending against Sangpu Mountain, echoing the puppet troops in Chenghai City. This area has many rivers, and the harbors are crisscrossed. The East Road Commander Ogasawara is responsible, with the assistance of Rear Admiral Kondo of the Navy. The Chinese army learned that the rear of the Japanese army was empty. On December 1, they launched a counterattack in several directions. Hong, Liu Zhilu, and other units attacked from Raoping and recaptured Huanggang, Qiantong, Jiuxiqiao, and Zhanglin, cutting off the rear of the Japanese and puppet troops entering Fujian. The Japanese and puppet troops in Chenggou then launched a counterattack against Huanggang, Qiantong, and Zhanglin on the 2nd and 3rd, but were all defeated by the Chinese army. In this battle, the militia played the biggest role. The Japanese army, defeated in Raoping and Chenghai, turned to harass Jieyang and Chaoyang in an attempt to contain the Chinese forces on the border of Fujian and Guangdong. On the morning of the 2nd, 400 Japanese and puppet troops in Chao'an City attacked Yixi, Zhuxiang, Shipi, and Guoqiushan, attempting to attack the Liuhuang and Tangkeng of Fengshun via the Shangrong District and Tiandong District. They were repelled by the Chinese army after fighting until the afternoon. At dawn on the 3rd, the Dehua troops attacked Fengxi, Wucuo, Dazhai, and Qingfang in three directions, with seven Japanese aircraft as the vanguard. Japanese cavalry galloped up Fengling. Japanese warships in Shantou sent 15 motorboats to invade the Gang and Sangtian of Chaoyang, looting grain, rice, pigs, and chickens from the people. A lot was looted in the first round, but the Chinese Self-Defense Corps was already prepared and launched a sudden attack when the Japanese soldiers were carrying things off the boat, killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers and seizing seven rifles. At 4:00 p.m. on the 3rd, the Chinese army bravely attacked, and as dusk approached, they used increasingly fierce firepower. At that time, the Japanese aircraft and cavalry had lost their ability to operate in the dim twilight, and they were defeated and retreated back to Chao City and Fuyang. That night, the Wushao Wu regiment of the Huazhen Middle Division of the Chinese army selected a dare-to-die team to rush into the foot of Bijiashan, where the Japanese military headquarters was located, cut through three layers of barbed wire, and used explosives to destroy four Japanese camps. The Japanese army was in great chaos, with 20 to 30 people killed or injured. The Fuyang market was also stormed by the Chinese team, and 40 loads of military supplies were captured. The Japanese army was frightened and held on to their strongholds, daring not to go out and harass again. At 3:00 a.m. on the 6th, the Chinese army attacked Chao'an City in three directions. The Chinese army from Raoping Phoenix Mountain moved first, ambushing the nursery of the Anfeng Road Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Field. After hearing the sound of artillery across the river, they attacked the Japanese camp behind Hanshan Bijiashan. There was a company of artillery stationed there. The mountain was surrounded by three layers of barbed wire from Chajiayuan to Dongjin Dike, stretching for 15 li. The Chinese army climbed the mountain to attack at 7:00 a.m. and fought fiercely with the Japanese artillery. Although they did not achieve their goal, they consumed a lot of Japanese ammunition. The main force attacking Chao'an City advanced from Fengxi and Yixi. The front of Anjie Road was in a feinting posture, attacking Fuyang. The Chinese army in Sangpu Mountain feigned an attack on Anbu, so that the Japanese army could not rescue Chao'an City. Other troops also carried out their missions according to the time steps. The troops on the Yixi side first attacked Hulu Mountain at the West Gate. At that time, it was not yet dawn, and they only engaged in close combat. The Japanese army in the city responded hastily and sent telegrams everywhere for help. At the same time, all places were in an emergency. Even the Japanese soldiers on Bijiashan across the river could not cross the bridge to help. The whole city was in chaos. After fighting for two hours, the Japanese army retreated to the South Gate Dike Road. The cannons, shells, and telephones of various strongholds in Chuncheng Tower were not taken away. The Chinese army galloped back and forth in the city. All the Japanese and puppet organs and warehouses in Taiping Road and Shangdong Dike were destroyed, and dozens of traitors were captured. The Japanese artillery on Bijiashan fired wildly into the city repeatedly, bombarding more than 1,000 rounds in one hour. The Chinese army knew that Japanese reinforcements would arrive, so they moved the light military equipment out of the city. On the evening of the 7th, the Japanese and puppet troops in Shantou entered the southeast gate by water and land, numbering about 2,000. After the 8th, the four suburbs of Chao City were still under the control of the Chinese army. In this battle, both sides suffered considerable losses. Hundreds of civilian houses in the city were destroyed by artillery shells, and thousands of people were killed or injured.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Rice Prices Soar; Due to Japanese Merchants in Suzhou Buying Large Quantities of White Rice</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: This year's autumn harvest in the four townships was a bumper year, the first good year since the occupation. The general public was full of hope that rice prices would fall, so as to live in peace. However, when the new grain was on the market, the price of white rice soared from 16 yuan to 20 yuan. In the past half month, it has been soaring day by day, and it is about to break the 30 yuan mark, causing the general public to complain endlessly. There was even a family of five who all starved to death. People in the rice industry said that since the Japanese puppet government banned the transportation of white rice to Shanghai, it seemed that the supply in Suzhou should be greater than the demand. However, in late last month, Japanese merchants came to Suzhou and bought a large quantity of white rice, so the rise in price may be due to this. As for the rice purchased by the merchants, it is said that it has all been transported to Shanghai, but it is unknown for what purpose.</p>

<h3>The 3rd Shen Bao Cup Charity Basketball Tournament Concludes Successfully Last Night; American Team Wins Again Over China 71 to 42; Chinese Team's Performance Last Night Was Impressive</h3>
<p>The 3rd Shen Bao Cup Sino-American Charity Basketball Tournament concluded successfully last night after the third match. The Chinese team, after two crushing defeats, played with a do-or-die spirit against the American team last night. Their morale was high, and they were full of energy. The score was very close at the beginning, and at one point, the difference was only five points. Unfortunately, they could not maintain this close game, and eventually lost 71 to 42. The American team won the championship with a record of three wins and zero losses. The brilliant Shen Bao Cup will be temporarily transferred to the American team for one year. The award ceremony was held during the halftime break last night, where Lu Yiming of the Shen Bao Newspaper delivered a speech in English and presented the award to Captain Pasco of the American team. William represented the American team in accepting the award and expressing thanks. The American team's strength this year is indeed very strong. Although the Chinese team suffered a setback in this final match, they must persevere and train diligently. Winning back the title next year is a certain thing.</p>
<p>Five Ties</p>
<p>The American team still fielded the all-black McBain. The Chinese team's A-Kui and Xianglong were unable to play due to injuries. After the jump ball, without much maneuvering, Saqin Detuo first broke through the basket, and Wang Nanqun immediately responded with a shot, tying the score at 2-2. Soon after, Saqin Detuo attacked the basket again, and Wang Nanqun impressively tied the score again. After Bao Du Xue scored, Zhang Shaoqing also scored under the basket, tying the score for the third time. The American team was greatly threatened and felt quite challenged. Then, the score tied again at 10-10 and 12-12, making it difficult to determine the winner. Five ties, the Chinese team tied the score five times, which was commendable. However, due to an occasional oversight, Saqin Detuo, Pasco, and Ge Xu consecutively scored three baskets, losing six points. Although they tried hard to catch up, they lost ground as quickly as they gained it. The score remained within six points. At the end of the first half, the Chinese team trailed 34 to 21, behind by thirteen points.</p>
<p>Nan Qun Shines</p>
<p>During the halftime break, Lu Yiming presented the Shen Bao Cup to the captain of the American team. The West Youth Fitness Class entertained the audience with a beautiful wooden exercise. There were also women's performances last night, which received enthusiastic applause. After the restart, both sides continued to play with their original lineups. The American team first increased their score by three points, and Zhou Wenyong responded with a shot. Wang Nanqun was truly remarkable, scoring four out of four shots, which caused the American team to lose color and call a timeout. When the two teams resumed the game, the Chinese team was still in high spirits. Nan Bangzhen and Shaoqing were active under the basket. From 21 to 37, they directly chased the score to 33 to 39 and 36 to 41, creating a tense atmosphere that was unexpected. This was the second peak performance of the Chinese team last night.</p>
<p>The Situation Changes Greatly</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this prosperous situation could not last. In the last ten minutes, due to a lack of stamina, their defense was wide open, and they collapsed. Zhou Wenyong struggled with exhaustion and failed to closely guard Ge Xu, allowing this huge American general to enter an uninhibited state, scoring eight goals on his own. With the help of Pasco, Bao Du Xue, and Laobote Xu, the American team added more than thirty points. When the score reached 50 to 36, the Chinese team called a timeout and replaced Shaoqing with Li Zude. Li's entry resulted in a foul, giving the American team a chance to score penalty points, further widening the gap. As a result, the Chinese team suffered their third defeat with a score of 42 to 71.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Order to the Whole Country to Develop Muslim Education, Appropriately Subsidizing Primary and Secondary School Finances</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) To ensure that Muslims thoroughly understand the meaning of the War of Resistance and the important responsibility of Muslims to save the country, key figures of Chongqing Muslims have organized the China Muslim National Salvation Association to engage in various activities to strengthen the national salvation power of Muslims. The association, recognizing the importance of Muslim education, has sent a letter to the Ministry of Education requesting assistance in development. In addition to approving the assistance, the Ministry has also approved four measures and issued an order to the educational departments and bureaus throughout the country to implement them. The approved measures are as follows: (1) Regarding primary and secondary school education, the principle of prioritizing the establishment of primary schools is adopted. Each province's educational department is instructed to supervise the establishment of primary schools attached to mosques in each county. The necessary funds may be appropriately subsidized from the compulsory education subsidy. (2) Teacher training should be planned and implemented by the Ministry of Education. (3) Scholarships for middle school students should still be handled by universities and educational departments in accordance with regulations, but may be appropriately increased. (4) The social education department should allow the provincial education departments to provide as much assistance as possible, and instruct the educational film distribution areas to send films to various mosques for screening from time to time.</p>
<h3>Overview of This Year's University Unified Entrance Examination (11)</h3>
<p>Liberal Arts: Number of students needed by all schools (hereinafter referred to as "needed") 919, number of students assigned (hereinafter referred to as "assigned") 447; Law: needed 6405, assigned 634; Teacher Training: needed 1090, assigned 660; Commerce: needed 390, assigned 106; Science: needed 1105, assigned 428; Engineering: needed 2235, assigned 1792; Agriculture: needed 740, assigned 233; Medicine: needed 440, assigned 253. The total number of students needed by all schools is 7555, and the number of students assigned is 4553 (excluding three special students).</p>
<p>The total number of students needed by all schools in the table above includes schools in Shanghai. The number of students assigned to liberal arts, science, agriculture, and commerce is less than half of what is needed. The teacher training and medical colleges are only about two-thirds of what is needed. The law department has mostly reached its quota because of the special assignments for those who applied for political science and economics. Among the engineering departments, the civil engineering, mechanical, electrical engineering, and aviation departments received the most applications, while the mining, metallurgy, textile, and surveying departments received too few. Therefore, the assignments are still insufficient. It can be seen that this year's candidates' applications are concentrated in engineering, especially in civil engineering, mechanical, electrical engineering, and aviation. In terms of the total number of assignments, it is still more than 3,000 students short of the total number needed. Adding the 815 students admitted in the Shanghai area, it is still not enough by more than 2,000 students. This proves that the admission of students this year is not lenient.</p>
<p>In addition, the distribution of students admitted to preparatory classes is in accordance with the established standards, distributed to the preparatory classes specially established by the Ministry of Education in their respective examination areas, Southwest Associated University, Yunnan University, Northwest University, Northwest Normal College, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University Longquan Branch, Guangxi University, National Normal College, Jinan University, etc., each class with 50 to 70 students.</p>
<p>(4) Explanation of the distribution, the procedure of distribution, such troubles, the situation of distribution, such difficulties, but the general public often think that distribution is a simple matter, especially the admitted students, often blame the Ministry of Education for not distributing them to their desired schools and departments. They have a misunderstanding, thinking that after being admitted, there is no problem with being distributed according to their wishes, or even think that the distribution is unfair based on the level of scores. They never think about how many people have the same wish, what the capacity of the school they wish to enter is, and where their scores rank among those who have the same wish. I can now give an example. Zhang Sheng took the exam in the second group in Chongqing, with a total score of 350, ranking 45th. His first choice was the aviation department of Central University, the second choice was the mechanical engineering department of Central University, and the third choice was the electrical engineering department of Southwest Associated University.</p>
<p>Li Sheng also took the exam in the second group in Chongqing, with a total score of 280, ranking 85th. His first choice was the mechanical engineering department of Central University, the second choice was the hydraulic engineering department of Central University, and the third choice was the electrical engineering department of Wuhan University. In the above example, assuming that the capacity of the aviation department of Central University is 30 students, according to the analysis and statistics of the previous choices, there are 221 people who wish to enter the aviation department of Central University. Although Zhang Sheng's score is high, his score ranks outside the top 30, so he is not admitted due to the quota being full. His second choice is the mechanical engineering department of Central University, but those who chose this department as their first choice have already filled the quota, so he cannot be assigned. His third choice is the electrical engineering department of Southwest Associated University, which is also already full. As a result, Zhang Sheng was assigned to the mechanical engineering department of another engineering college that had not filled its quota. Li Sheng's score is lower than Zhang Sheng's, and he could not be assigned to the mechanical engineering department of Central University. However, because there were few applicants for his second choice, the hydraulic engineering department of Central University, Li Sheng's score ranked within the quota, so he was admitted to this department. In terms of schools, Zhang Sheng's score is higher and his ranking is higher, but he was assigned to another university. Li Sheng's score is lower and his ranking is lower, but he was assigned to Central University.</p>

<h3>Subscribing to Foreign Rice Fund: Aiming to Raise One Million Yuan; Regulation Association Invited Various Industries to Negotiate Yesterday; 320,000 Yuan Was Subscribed on the Spot; The Regulation Plan Involves Both Group Ordering of Rice and Selling at Fair Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association invited representatives from various industries to negotiate raising funds, ordering foreign rice, and regulating the people's food at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from the flour industry, rice industry, rice shops, yarn industry, cotton industry, timber industry, silk industry, cotton cloth industry, egg industry, sugar industry, insurance industry, jewelry industry, knitting industry, dyeing and weaving industry, rubber industry, travel industry, restaurant industry, transportation and customs declaration industry, sauce garden industry, traditional Chinese medicine industry, cinder factory industry, shipping industry, yarn factory association, Huacheng Tobacco Company, and other representatives and directors of the association, totaling more than 50 people, were present. Chu Qiaqing, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Xi Yushu reported the establishment process of the association and submitted the association's articles of association, fundraising methods, and foreign rice ordering methods to the representatives for ratification. The chairman then reported on the first invitation to representatives of various industries on December 19 to determine the amount of funds and the situation of contacting silver and money shops for advances. Representatives from various industries subscribed to raise funds on the spot, which was very enthusiastic, totaling 320,000 yuan. Combined with the first 200,000 yuan, it has reached 520,000 yuan. It is heard that the association's fundraising target is set at one million yuan. Because several guilds still need to wait for the industry conference to determine the amount, and at the same time, the silver and money industries will definitely subscribe for more than other industries, it will not be difficult to raise one million yuan in a short period of time. The association's foreign rice ordering methods and application registration forms are currently being printed. Once printed, they will be announced and registration will begin.</p>
<p>Methods for Raising Foreign Rice Funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association's methods for raising funds: (1) This association aims to raise funds to purchase rice and relieve the rice shortage in the city, in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the articles of association, to raise a fund of one million yuan in national currency. (2) This association's fund will be raised by the founders of this association from various industrial and commercial groups, social groups, and wealthy people from all walks of life. (3) The use of the fund is determined to be to advance the purchase of foreign rice to regulate the market. (4) This association designates several banks and money shops as fund collection agencies. (5) The receipt for the fund will be signed and sealed by two executive directors and the treasurer of this association. (6) The fund will be kept by the fund management committee of this association. (7) The disbursement of the fund will be based on the seals of all members of the fund management committee of this association. (5) The board of directors of this association may make a resolution to use the fund and notify the fund management committee of this association to disburse it. (9) The operation of this association's fund should be handled by the treasurer with special accounting. (10) When this association is dissolved, the fund should be returned to the original payers. If there are losses due to purchasing rice to stabilize the market, the amount to be repaid should be reduced proportionally. (11) These methods are formulated by the board of directors of the Wood Association and are subject to revision.</p>
<p>The Authorities Reply to Protect Rice Merchants</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association previously requested the authorities to protect legitimate rice merchants due to the rampant rice grabbing. In addition to repeatedly sending representatives to visit Mr. He, the Deputy Director-General of the Public Concession Industry Bureau, and the person in charge of the French Concession Public Board, the Public Concession Industry Bureau has now replied to the association in writing. The original letter is recorded as follows: To the Bean and Rice Industry Association, We have received your letter of December 18 and are aware of the situation. The various sections mentioned in the Bureau's notice are specifically aimed at a group of hoarders and are not directly aimed at your association's legitimate rice merchants. The Bureau has also consulted with the police department to do its best to protect legitimate rice shops so that they can all live in peace.</p>
<p>A Preliminary Discussion of the People's Food Regulation Plan</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yanfang, the director of the People's Food Regulation Association, published a preliminary discussion on the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Plan yesterday, stating that although the rice market has been severely cracked down on by the concession authorities and persuaded by people from all walks of life, a small number of hoarders are slightly afraid and eager to sell their stocks. Rice shops have experienced rice grabbing incidents due to the times, resulting in disputes. As a result, they are passively resisting, and rice prices have temporarily stabilized. In fact, the situation is loose on the surface but tight underneath, and the future troubles are just beginning. Seeking a regulation plan is as urgent as fire burning eyebrows and cannot be delayed. As far as I can see, to stabilize rice prices, the prerequisite is:</p>
<p>Sufficient Inventory</p>
<p>There must be sufficient inventory, and rice prices will naturally be stable. What is the method? First, each industry association should notify its member factories and shops to quickly order foreign rice in groups, with six months' worth of food as the minimum, and must include the rice for the families of all employees in each factory and shop, register with the association, and the association will directly order from abroad in a public manner. When the goods arrive, they will be sold to each factory and shop at cost, paying a deposit of several yuan per bag to the association. Registration must be done on the basis of each industry association. If prices fall when the goods arrive and member factories and shops hesitate to sell, the association will handle the matter directly. In addition to receiving deposits from each industry association, the association will also discuss advance payment methods with silver and money shops (this matter is already progressing and prices can be paid in installments when the goods arrive in the future). Middle and upper-class families can also register with the association in accordance with the above methods.</p>
<p>Ordering Foreign Rice</p>
<p>In short, the principle is not to compete with the lower classes for rice. Even if rice prices fall in the future, the factories and shops will suffer a slight loss, but the amount is not large. Moreover, it is difficult to predict how rice prices will be in the coming autumn. Why not sacrifice a small amount for the greater good? As for the factories and shops ordering rice for their employees, so that they have no worries, they can concentrate on their work and gain huge benefits invisibly. Some may say that according to this method, the rice for those who have some economic ability is well-planned, but how will the lower classes get rice? It is said that there is a cause and effect in this. Those who hoard and speculate think their plan is good. Once the above methods are implemented, no one will care about hoarding rice, and most of what is hoarded is local rice, which is difficult to store for a long time. They will have to sell it at a loss. A sale will lead to a fall, and another sale will lead to another fall. The purpose of fair prices will be achieved, the lower classes will be happy, and the hoarders will suffer. Using the enemy's spear to attack the enemy's shield, isn't the plan good? Someone suggests using</p>
<p>Fair Price Selling Methods</p>
<p>as a regulation plan. The method is feasible, but the masses are large, and it is difficult to sustain without a large amount of funds. If we can combine group ordering of foreign rice with fair price selling, the effect will be significant. The method is to charge a fee of one or two yuan per bag under the item of ordering foreign rice (the name will be determined separately), and use this income as a fair price selling fund. Those who order will pay one or two yuan more per bag, but in fact, if they buy rice from rice shops, the rice shops' profit may be more than this one or two yuan. If the fair price selling fund relies entirely on donations, it may not be reliable.</p>
<h3>Xin'an Na and Xin'an Mao Sailed to Wenzhou, But Were Again Blocked Outside the Port</h3>
<p>After the Manli Maller passenger and cargo ship was released and the Shanghai-Wenzhou route resumed, the foreign ships that joined the route included the Norwegian ship Huasheng and the British ships Xin'an Na and Xin'an Mao. The Huasheng arrived in Wenzhou on the 19th. It was learned yesterday that the Xin'an Na and Xin'an Mao arrived outside Wenzhou Port on the evening of the 20th at the same time. Because they saw Japanese warships anchored on the ocean surface, the two ships anchored outside Huanghuaguan. As of last night, they had not entered the port. The British ship Manli Maller, which was released and returned to Shanghai a few days ago, has now registered with the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Department and is scheduled to continue loading cargo and sail to Wenzhou from Shanghai at 4:00 PM today. It is now learned that the lessee has completed the procedures for the passengers and cargo detained by the Wenzhou authorities last time, so the detained passengers and cargo have also been released.</p>
<h3>Wu Mulan Assassinated in a Public Apartment in North China; Man Rushed into Bedroom Yesterday Morning and Fired Two Shots, Both Striking Vital Points, Resulting in Gruesome Death; Cause of Attack Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Ms. Wu Mulan, a progressive woman of the Chinese Revolution from Nanchang, Jiangxi, was fifty years old this year. She followed Premier Sun in her early years to participate in women's revolutionary work, and was a veteran member of the Tongmenghui. She was extremely active in the women's circles in Nanjing, advocating for women's electoral rights, and was renowned at the time. After the August 13th Incident, when the Nationalist army withdrew from Nanjing, Ms. Wu handled rear-area women's work in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui areas. Several months ago, she came to Shanghai and originally resided at No. 5 Hongren Lane, Lafayette Road, in the French Concession. She has a son named Wu Zhenqiu, who is eighteen years old this year and is currently studying at Pudong Middle School. Ms. Wu was recently working hard to promote the Women's Peace Association, serving as its president. On the 6th of this month, Ms. Wu suddenly left her home and moved to Room 13 on the second floor of the front building of the North China Apartment at No. 431 Malong Road, intending to reside there permanently. The agreed monthly rent was thirty yuan, and a Yangzhou woman named Wang Yuezhen was hired as a maid. Usually when guests visited, Wu would dismiss the maid outside the door for secret conversations. At 11:15 AM yesterday, a man suddenly rushed into Ms. Wu's bedroom and immediately drew a pistol. He shot Wu, one bullet hitting her left temple and the other hitting her left chest. She collapsed on the spot from her injuries. The assailant turned around and fled. Subsequently, the North China Apartment's tea room attendant discovered the incident, informed the accounting office, and reported it to the French police. An ambulance was immediately called, and Wu was sent to the hospital. However, due to the severity of her injuries, she died en route. The body was then transferred to the cadaver examination office on Tairas Road, pending inspection by personnel dispatched by the Second Special Court today. Afterwards, the French police authorities dispatched personnel to investigate the cause of Wu's murder. Inside her room, they found a letter from Ju Zheng, the President of the Judicial Yuan, addressed to her, as well as a letter sent from the New Capital Hotel in Hankou. No other discoveries were made. The true cause of the murder is still under investigation. Another report stated that Ms. Wu Mulan was from Fuzhou, Jiangxi, currently 52 years old, and had resided in Nanjing for many years. During the Xinhai Revolution, she served as the captain of the women's daredevil team that captured Nanjing. Later, she also served as an advisor to Yuan Shikai. She had a high reputation in women's circles. Before August 13th, she served as the president of the Nanjing branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society and the head of the Nanjing Women's Legal and Political Training Institute in the capital. She was once married to Wang Jiannong, a brigade commander under Lan Tianwei, but later divorced due to disagreements. Her son's name is Zhenqiu, and he uses his mother's surname. According to general rumors, a man in a blue cloth long gown suddenly visited Hongren Lane several days ago, claiming to be delivering an appointment letter, seeking to meet with Wu Mulan. At the time, this person's behavior was suspicious, so he was refused. Ms. Wu immediately moved to the North China Apartment the next day.</p>

<h3>Old Five-Jiao Subsidiary Notes of the Chinese Farmers' Bank Entrusted to the Bank of China for Exchange; 500,000 Yuan of New Subsidiary Notes Transported to Shanghai; Belongs to the HSBC on the Bund</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Chinese Farmers' Bank, in order to alleviate the panic of subsidiary currency in the market, in addition to entrusting a portion of the five-jiao notes to the Bank of China for continued exchange, also retained a large portion for exchange by the bank as usual. However, it is limited to legitimate merchants, and the exchange amount is based on their needs. The 500,000 yuan of Chinese Farmers' Bank jiao notes were ordered by the British HSBC. The exchange date is pending.</p>
<p>Bank of China Exchanging Chinese Farmers' Bank Subsidiary Notes</p>
<p>The Chinese Farmers' Bank's Shanghai branch on Avenue Joffre, previously concerned about the extreme shortage of jiao notes in Shanghai, and unscrupulous merchants taking the opportunity to profit, has been withdrawing and exchanging as much of the white-background, blue-print five-jiao notes as possible to regulate the market. However, to date, there is still a shortage of jiao notes in the market. Therefore, a portion of the five-jiao notes has been entrusted to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank on Avenue Albert for exchange, and a notice has been posted in front of the bank, stating "Five-jiao subsidiary notes, please exchange at the Central Bank in Yiyuan." It is reported that the amount of exchange by the Bank of China is limited to 50 yuan per business. If legitimate merchants need more, they can prepare a letter and request an exchange from the Chinese Farmers' Bank branch. However, the quantity is approved by the bank based on the extent of their needs.</p>
<p>HSBC Orders and Transports Subsidiary Currency to Regulate the Market</p>
<p>The British HSBC on the Bund, feeling that the problem of the lack of subsidiary currency in the market has not been fully resolved, which greatly affects the livelihoods of ordinary people, ordered 500,000 yuan of new subsidiary currency notes from the Chinese Farmers' Bank's Hong Kong office from Hong Kong. The exchange date is pending. These 500,000 new notes were all ordered by the British HSBC itself and have nothing to do with the Chinese Farmers' Bank. The new notes are divided into one-jiao and two-jiao denominations, printed by the China Great Wall Company. The front is blue with a rural landscape, stating "Printed in the 26th year of the Republic of China." The back is brown with patterns. It is said that they have already been issued in the mainland. Therefore, the Chinese Farmers' Bank notes transported to Shanghai are not owned by the Chinese Farmers' Bank.</p>
<h3>End of the Gregorian Calendar Year; Extend Loans as Much as Possible; Banks and Money Shops Settle Accounts; All Debts Must Be Cleared</h3>

Money shops have decided to add an ordinary account settlement at the end of the Gregorian calendar year and have set a three-day holiday from January 1st, resuming business on the 4th, including the Central Bank, China Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers' Bank.</p>

The interest rate is 7.5% for discounts and 2.5% for loans.</p>
<h3>Asiatica Petroleum Company Experiences Labor Strife</h3>
<p>Shanghai Company Employees Tentatively Agree to Resume Work; Employees in Yangshupu Reportedly Still Have Problems; The British Asiatica Petroleum Company, located at No. 1 on the Bund, has branch offices, piers, and warehouses in Yangshupu and Pudong. From the 19th, employees in the Yangshupu section of the company, feeling that the cost of living has been increasing daily and that it is difficult to maintain their livelihoods, convened a meeting and selected representatives on the 20th to submit a request to the company authorities to improve their treatment. Employees in the Bund section also submitted requests at the same time.</p>
<p>Two Demands</p>
<p>It is reported that the company's one thousand employees made two demands: (1) Those whose rice prices are between 20 and 40 yuan will receive an additional subsidy of 20 yuan, and those above 45 yuan will receive a subsidy of 30 yuan. (2) The year-end bonus, which has always been half a month's salary, should be changed to a full month. They requested the company to respond within three days. The company felt that the boss was currently in Tokyo and could not resolve the issue urgently. Therefore, even though the three-day period had expired as of yesterday morning, the company had still not been able to make a concrete response.</p>
<p>One Discussion</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday, employee representatives Yao and Li went to see the company's personnel manager, a British man named Mitchkin (transliteration), to request that the company accept the employees' demands and solemnly declared the pure stance of the colleagues, determined not to be used by any party. This request to improve treatment was really forced by life, and they asked the authorities to understand their plight. After an hour of discussion, the authorities still stated that the boss was not in Shanghai and could not give a concrete answer. The two representatives returned disappointed.</p>
<p>Caused Disputes</p>
<p>Because the issue of improving treatment had not yielded concrete results, and when employee representatives Yao and Li visited the three British supervisors, the British supervisors' responses were slightly tough. Thereupon, all employees began a work slowdown at 11:00 AM yesterday and went to the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department to appeal for mediation. During the work slowdown, employees on the Bund were exceptionally orderly, so they were quite disciplined. At noon, the Bund company sent someone to inspect the situation of the Yangshupu employees. A White Russian drove there, but when the car was about to arrive, a dispute occurred with the employees, resulting in six or seven workers being injured.</p>
<p>Someone Instigated</p>
<p>The "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association," under Japanese control, previously participated in the strike at the Lun Chang Company, causing the Lun Chang strike to be protracted. Now that the company's Yangshupu employees have reported a work slowdown, someone from the "Welfare Association" is attempting to control it again. It was learned yesterday that several Japanese military police were guarding outside the factory building. Compared with the Bund's work slowdown, the atmosphere and environment felt very different.</p>
<p>Employees Serious</p>
<p>As for the Bund, after the work slowdown at 11:00 AM yesterday, two young Japanese men suddenly rushed to the site, speaking in broken Chinese, telling the employees that they were very willing to help the employees. However, all employees felt that this request to improve treatment was for a pure purpose and that the company had been very cooperative with the employees in the past and did not want to cause any more disputes as a result. Therefore, they did not pay attention to the two young men from unknown sources from beginning to end. The company was reportedly very pleased with this spirit of deep understanding of righteousness among all the employees.</p>
<p>Authorities Mediation</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM yesterday, Gu Bingyuan of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department went to the company's office to convene labor and management for mediation. Because the boss was not in Shanghai, no one was responsible for a while. Mr. Gu took responsibility for ensuring that the two demands made by the employees would be answered satisfactorily by Friday (the 29th) and persuaded them to resume work first. The employee representatives felt satisfied and demanded on the spot that the three supervisors provide a real guarantee for the employees' jobs, which was also accepted. Therefore, all employees resumed work at around 4:00 PM, so the employee strife at the Bund company office temporarily came to an end. However, the Yangshupu and Pudong sections may have additional problems and will not be easy to resolve. Within a few hours of the work slowdown, major companies such as Sincere, Wing On, and Ewo sent representatives with goods to express their condolences. The company's employees were very grateful for this spirit of mutual assistance.</p>

<h3>Truth About Car Shooting Still Unclear; Western Police Sergeant Did Not Fire on Scene; Police Are Investigating</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that at approximately 6:30 PM yesterday (the 21st), a car was driving on Jing'an Temple Road between Seymour Road and Gordon Road when it was suddenly shot at by several shots from the side of the road. By the time police personnel had the opportunity to take action, both the car and the shooter had escaped. This is clearly an attempted assassination, but the mystery has not been solved. According to witnesses who informed the police, four people appeared near Seymour Road beforehand, two of whom were armed. When a black car passed by, the armed men went to the edge of the sidewalk and fired several shots at the car, hitting it. However, the driver immediately accelerated and drove out of the range of the bullets. At about the same time, Bess, the deputy police sergeant of the Jing'an Temple police station, was patrolling the scene on a motorcycle. He got off his vehicle to investigate, but was shot at several times by thugs, none of which hit him. Bess feared injuring pedestrians, so he did not return fire. The thugs then fled. The following matter makes this case even more complicated. Around 9:15 PM at night, six cars with Shanghai Defense Army endorsements, carrying a car escorted by Japanese, were traveling west on Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, turning onto Yu Garden Road and being escorted along. The car being escorted and the car shot at on Jing'an Temple Road were of the same type. As for what kind of car the Japanese were escorting, it is not yet certain. The police are currently investigating whether there is any connection between the shooting and the Japanese-escorted car.</p>
<h3>Supplementary Water Fee for Postal Remittances to Tianjin, Pingjin, and Shandong Collected at a Uniform Rate of Ten Cents per Yuan</h3>
<p>For postal remittances from Shanghai to Tianjin, Shandong, and Beiping, a supplementary water fee should be collected per yuan. This was initially determined by the Shanghai Postal Administration to be collected at rates of three cents, five cents, and seven cents. According to a report from the New Voice Agency, the supplementary water fee that should be collected for the above areas is uniformly collected at ten cents. However, the limit per person per day for remittances is: (1) 50 yuan for each of the general branch offices in Shanghai, and (2) 20 yuan for each of the inland offices.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Not Yet Opened; British Ships Already Being Discriminated Against; British Ship Sailing Down the River Gate Threatened; Foreign Ships to Ports Along the River Gate Discontinue Navigation</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese have been spreading rumors about opening navigation on the Shanghai-Nanjing section of the Yangtze River in order to please the American government and the public in hopes of renegotiating new trade agreements. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese have been citing the war zone as a reason for the Yangtze River being impassable. Foreign merchant ships have long since changed their navigation to the lower reaches. Unexpectedly, in March of this year, the Japanese navy intensified its efforts to obstruct foreign merchant ships from sailing to ports along the North Beach of the Tongzhou port, such as the upper reaches of the river. Then, they changed their navigation to ports such as Lingdian, Xingang, Hutong, Sanhe, and Qinglong in the lower reaches of the river. However, recently, amidst the Japanese spreading rumors about opening navigation on the Yangtze River, they have been obstructing the navigation of foreign merchant ships at the lower reaches of the river, especially paying attention to British ships. Whenever British ships sail to North Beach, Japanese warships follow them. When they are about to load and unload cargo at the port, they indiscriminately open fire with machine guns, threatening ships in the port to not dare to sail out, causing British ships to be unable to load and unload cargo, often returning empty or traveling back and forth in the Yangtze River, delaying ship schedules. For example, two British ships that left the port on the morning of the 19th have not yet returned to Shanghai. Presumably, because the outgoing cargo has not been unloaded and the incoming cargo cannot be loaded. According to the two companies, regardless of whether passengers and cargo can be loaded and unloaded, they will definitely return to Shanghai to spend the festival on Christmas Eve. This loss cannot be calculated. Currently, except for Qinglong Port and Hutong Port, which are still passable, all other ports in the lower reaches of the river have been closed.</p>

<h3>Malaya Exchange Control Will Be Improved; Agreement Reached to Increase Remittance Amounts; Report by National Products Inspection Delegation</h3>
<p>Local national product groups in Shanghai recently received a letter from the National Product Inspection Delegation stationed overseas stating that the Malayan Straits Settlements government promulgated an exchange control ordinance on September 13, which included Chinese legal tender, which merchants found inconvenient. On November 6, the government issued a new exchange control ordinance, which Chinese merchants complained about even more. According to the ordinance, remittances exceeding 500 Singapore dollars must request foreign exchange, and exports of local goods must also pledge foreign exchange, which Chinese merchants found unaccustomed to. Chinese merchants in Singapore who operate goods from the Dutch East Indies, Vietnam, Yangon, and China united on the 10th of last month and, led by Zheng Guyue, the director of the Java Clan Association, and Gao Dunhou, the director of the Rice Merchants Association, visited Zheng Liande, the overseas Chinese official of the Legislative Council, listed all kinds of difficulties on a piece of paper, and asked the commercial control officer to be accommodating. Zheng said that if merchants have any difficulties, the government can discuss and implement appropriate measures and instructed the representatives to list the measures in detail and submit them to the authorities for reference. The representatives then discussed and decided on three measures as follows: First, ask the authorities to increase the amount not subject to exchange control from 500 yuan to 1,000 yuan. Second, request permission to transfer accounts, such as if A buys from B, C can directly pay B, without having to go through A, to save trouble. Third, if there is no bank in small villages and towns, payment for goods can be made if the shipowner transporting the goods issues a certificate, which can also be effective. These three measures were then discussed at the board meeting of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on the 11th. As a result, the chairman and vice-chairman of the association were entrusted to contact Councilor Zheng Liande to negotiate with the government and appeal for improvement. As for the government's restriction on the import of 24 kinds of goods, it was also decided to ask the government to publish the names of the goods included in each category in detail to facilitate merchants.</p>
<h3>Eastern District Workers Instigated; Strike Incidents Occur Repeatedly</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that workers in factories in the Eastern District have recently resumed strike incidents, which are due to the continuous instigation of the "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" under Japanese control at No. 127 Yangon Road. Workers at the Hua Aluminum Steel Factory recently went on strike and resumed work shortly after their demands were met. However, on Tuesday, a demonstration organized by the "Welfare Association" was held in front of the factory, and more than 250 workers went on strike again. The factory has hired ten German-Jewish refugees to maintain work. In addition, 80 workers at the Datong Rubber Factory (transliteration) at No. 301 Meizhou Road and 150 workers at the China Textile Factory at No. 171 Yanping Road have also gone on strike. The workers are all demanding "rice subsidies," and the "Welfare Association" is taking the opportunity to carry out its conspiracy and instigate a complete strike.</p>

<h3>Five-Route Bus Causes Accident; Driver Arrested for Questioning; Investigation Concludes It Was Driver's Fault</h3>
<p>At 9:40 AM on the 21st, Five-Route Bus No. 15016, due to careless driving, crashed into Hengdali Clock and Watch Store at No. 262 Nanjing Road, while also killing Yongren Hu Huanrong (50 years old, resident of No. 55 Hengqing Lane, Baile Road), who was riding a tricycle. After investigation by Chief Patrol Wang Shusheng and Western Detective from the General Patrol Room, it was found that the car was driven by Hu Baochai and was driving from south to north on Henan Road, passing through the Nanjing Road intersection. Because the traffic light had changed to red at the time, he immediately braked. Unexpectedly, it crossed the road. At the same time, due to excessive force, the carburetor mechanism was damaged and could not move. Therefore, Hu got out of the car and used a hand-cranked machine to crank the carburetor, starting the car so as to avoid crossing the middle of the road. However, Hu forgot to put the gear lever in neutral, and it was in first or second gear. As a result, once the carburetor was cranked, the car moved forward on its own without being driven, causing the accident. Therefore, the detectives believe it was Hu's fault and detained him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, explained the process and requested an extension for questioning. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and ordered Hu to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Police Officer's Pistol Robbed</h3>

<h3>Seduction and Abortion Case: Appeal Rejected, Original Verdict Upheld</h3>
<p>Ma Caizhen, a 22-year-old woman from Pinghu, was sold as a maid to Lu Qinsheng, a wealthy local gentleman, by her biological mother when she was young. Three years ago, she was seduced and coerced into sexual relations by Lu. When the war broke out, Lu took his family and Ma to Shanghai to avoid the fighting, and the sexual relations continued. The year before last, Ma secretly became pregnant. Lu's wife, Xing, colluded with Lu's daughter, Zhu Lu, and her son-in-law, Zhu Zizhao, to send Ma to Dr. Yang Zhenfu at the Pingmin Hospital on Weihaiwei Road for surgery to induce an abortion. This caused severe physical damage to Ma and endangered her life. Consequently, lawyer Yu Zhaolin filed a complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing Lu Qinsheng and his wife, Zhu Zizhao and his wife, and Dr. Yang Zhenfu of crimes such as seduction, incitement, and aiding abortion. However, the defendant Lu Qinsheng evaded arrest after the case was filed. The initial trial, presided over by Judge Miao Qingbang, sentenced Lu's wife, Xing, to six months' imprisonment with a suspended sentence, and issued an arrest warrant for Lu Qinsheng. Details of these events were reported in this newspaper. Dissatisfied with the verdict, both parties appealed to the High Court's Third Branch. Numerous hearings were held, but Lu Qinsheng remained at large. The plaintiff, Ma Caizhen, also fell ill in the hospital due to the effects of the abortion, causing the case to be suspended for years. The trial finally concluded recently, and the verdict was announced yesterday. The appeal was rejected. In addition to the arrest warrant for Lu Qinsheng, Lu's wife, Xing, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Woman Trafficking Drugs Intercepted While Crossing the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Wang Lu, a woman from Changshu, was caught yesterday at 9 PM at the Caojiadu carrying 99 bags of heroin. She intended to cross the Huangpu River from the No. 6 dock on the Bund. Female Constable No. 24 intercepted her. This morning, she was brought before the First Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court, charged with drug trafficking. The defendant admitted to carrying the drugs to her home in the Pudong countryside for her own consumption. Judge Feng reviewed the confession and adjourned the trial, ordering her to be detained pending judgment.</p>
<h3>Prison Guard Arrested for Malfeasance: Soliciting Bribes from Inmate's Family, Awaiting Prisoner's Testimony</h3>
<p>Zhou Wangzhu, son of Zhou Gu, the owner of Zhou Maoxing Iron Shop at No. 6, Lane 333, Henan Road, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the First Special Court in 1931 for a kidnapping case investigated by the Jing'an Temple police. While serving his sentence in the Western Prison, in May of this year, a prison guard used a note from Zhou Wangzhu to fraudulently obtain ten yuan in legal tender from Zhou Gu. In July, he fraudulently obtained another fifty yuan. On the 13th of this month, prison guard No. 138, Sha Rongsheng from Zhenjiang, went to Zhou Gu's residence, claiming that Zhou Wangzhu needed money in prison and asking her to bring fifty yuan to the prison. Because Zhou Gu and others were not home at the time, the money was not delivered. At noon the day before yesterday, Sha went to collect the money again. Zhou Gu reported this to the General Police Station, which dispatched Detective Zhu Wanjun, who arrested Sha. A note written by Zhou Wangzhu was found on his person. This morning, he was brought before the First Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin charged him with malfeasance under Article 122 of the Criminal Code and requested that he be punished according to the law. Zhou Gu provided evidence. Sha claimed that Zhou Wangzhu had requested money from his family before, but he had not been involved in collecting it. This was the first time. The money was to be used by Zhou to buy food in prison, etc. Judge Feng Shi'de reviewed the confession and ordered Sha to be detained, postponing the hearing for one week to allow Zhou Wangzhu to be brought in for questioning.</p>
<h3>Factory Owner Sues Apprentice for Breach of Contract: Agreement Not to Manufacture or Operate Independently After Apprenticeship; Defendant Claims Contract Was Terminated, Has Letters to Prove It</h3>
<p>Chen Genxiang, a 64-year-old native of Dinghai and owner and manager of the Guohe Soy Sauce Factory at No. 11, Lane 1058, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, recently, through his lawyer Jiang Baoli, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against the manager of the Yi Yi Chemical Factory at No. 16, Lane 110 on the same road, alleging breach of contract and seeking an order to cease operations. According to the complaint, in 1936, the defendant, introduced by his brother-in-law Song Canlin, sought to learn the skill of manufacturing soy sauce from the plaintiff and declared that he would strictly maintain the manufacturing secrets and would never disclose them. He also stated that after leaving the plaintiff's employment, he would not engage in the same business as the plaintiff without the plaintiff's consent. He signed a written agreement to this effect. The plaintiff then instructed him. However, after the defendant completed his apprenticeship, he first requested to resign, and then established his own Yi Yi Chemical Factory to engage in business, which was a violation of the original agreement. The plaintiff requested an order to cease operations, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Liang held a hearing on the case. The plaintiff first stated the reasons for the lawsuit. The defendant, represented by lawyer Pan Zhensheng, argued that the plaintiff's claims were inaccurate. Although the defendant learned the soy sauce manufacturing technology from the plaintiff, the so-called agreement signed by the defendant had long been terminated with the plaintiff's consent. He had declared to the plaintiff that he was opening the Yi Yi Chemical Factory, and the plaintiff had allowed him to regain his freedom, as evidenced by the plaintiff's letters. At that time, the plaintiff claimed that the agreement was lost and would be returned when found, and that even if it was not produced, it would be considered waste paper. The plaintiff also made a solemn oath that he would not make things difficult in the future. Now, more than a year later, the plaintiff suddenly went back on his oath and filed a lawsuit, which was contradictory. Previously, the plaintiff had partnered with Lu Rongzhang, but the products were of poor quality, and the business failed, resulting in debt. The plaintiff asked the defendant for assistance, and the defendant asked Song Canlin to provide a loan and appointed the defendant as the factory supervisor. The plaintiff, seeing the defendant's enthusiasm and dedication, offered him a one-percent bonus and had a draft agreement prepared, instructing the defendant to sign it to teach the manufacturing technology. The defendant, finding it insufficient to cover expenses, discussed terminating the contract with the plaintiff and seeking his own livelihood. All of this can be proven by letters, etc. He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. After reviewing the circumstances, the court ordered that the hearing be postponed for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Xiang Yongbin, a local resident of Hongqiao Town West, came to Shanghai to escape the chaos after the August 13th Incident. Recently, Xiang found it difficult to maintain his livelihood due to the high cost of living in Shanghai and planned to move back to Hongqiao Town. He returned to Hongqiao Town the day before yesterday. The wall of his house had been destroyed by artillery fire, so he hired several workers to repair it. The workers saw two iron balls in the pile of bricks and tiles. Not knowing what they were, the workers struck the iron balls with bricks and stones. The iron balls exploded immediately. The workers Xu A'yuan (29 years old) and Gu Chuanquan (31 years old) were injured in the head and hands. Xiang sent people to accompany them to Shanghai for treatment at a hospital.</p>

<h3>Substitute Worker Embezzles Large Sum, Arrested and Sentenced to One Year</h3>
<p>Zhang Tianqing from Haimen, who was acting as a clerk at the Xinhua Trust and Savings Bank at No. 361 Jiangxi Road, as a substitute for Ying Abao, was ordered by the manager at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to deliver 1,000 yuan in cash to the head office downstairs from the Dangkou branch office on the second floor. Unexpectedly, Zhang was tempted by the sight of the money and hid the cash in his pockets, fleeing the bank. He bought more than ten pieces of clothing material and a ship ticket in preparation for returning home. Fortunately, the bank discovered the theft early and reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to the No. 2 dock on the Bund and apprehended the defendant, recovering 1,947.9 yuan in cash. Yesterday, he was brought before the First Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court, charged with embezzlement.

<h3>Female Server Doused with Corrosive Liquid: Victim Unwilling to Prosecute, Case Dismissed</h3>
<p>Xu Yutian, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 48 Xiamen Road, recently became acquainted with Sun A'ying, a Ningbo native and tea server at the No. 8 booth in the roof garden amusement park of the Wing On Company, while playing at the amusement park. Xu repeatedly asked Sun to meet him privately, but she refused. Xu harbored resentment. On the 20th of this month, Xu went to the Wing On amusement park again and followed Sun for a long time before leaving. After Sun returned home, she discovered that her qipao had been doused with corrosive liquid, causing holes in several places. Fortunately, the fabric was thick and sturdy, and her skin was not injured. She immediately concluded that Xu was the perpetrator. Fearing that he would use more harmful methods in the future, she reported it to the Laozha Police Station. The detectives arrested Xu at the Wing On amusement park. Yesterday morning, he was charged with intent to harm at the First Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. According to Xu's confession, he had argued about the tea bill, but he had no intention of harming Sun with the corrosive liquid. He wanted to destroy the qipao because it was a gift he had given to Sun. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Xu's confession only proved that he had committed the crime of property damage. He requested that the charges be amended. The court stated that the crime of property damage required a complaint to be filed. They asked Sun if she wanted to file a complaint. Sun replied that she did not want to prosecute. Judge Feng then declared that the case was dismissed.</p>

<h3>Transporting Local Goods to the Interior: Inspecting Goods at the Export Docks, Applicable to Vessels Above Two Hundred Tons</h3>
<p>General Affairs Notice No. 102 from the Jianghai Customs states that, with the exception of those who have obtained special permits, all ships and the goods they carry for import and export should be processed according to the usual customs declaration procedures starting from December 16, 1938, as stated in Notice No. 93 of December 8, 1938. It is now decided that, starting from January 4, 1940, for all local goods transported to the interior by ships of 200 tons or more that are cleared by this department, whether taxed ad valorem or by weight, the declaration form must be submitted at the export ship's dock, and the goods must be placed on the dock in preparation for customs inspection. For local goods transported to the interior by ships of 200 tons or less, the declaration form will still be processed according to the usual procedures at the export registration office, with no changes.</p>
<h3>Dredging Bureau Dredging Vessels: Only Some Have Been Returned</h3>
<p>The dredging vessels of the Dredging Bureau that were seized are now being returned because the bureau was forced to reorganize, with the Japanese side finally agreeing to return them. However, only a portion has been returned to date. The ships have been requisitioned and idle for a long time, so the machinery is mostly rusted. It is understood that the dredging department of the bureau has inspected them together with the harbor affairs department of the Jianghai Customs and will then proceed to the dock for repairs. Therefore, the restoration of dredging in the Huangpu River is still pending.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil, Tea, Bristles: Declaration and Transit Procedures</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously issued orders to various customs offices to announce the regulations for settlement of foreign exchange and declaration of export goods, detailed lists of restricted transit of export goods, and tables of designated restricted transit areas for restricted transit goods. The ministry has now telegraphed various customs offices to the effect that all tung oil, bristles, and mineral products that are declared for transit by designated purchasing and reporting agencies should be released only upon verification of the transport permits or domestic sales licenses issued by the ministry and filled out by the designated agencies. However, tea should be carefully identified by the China Tea Company in conjunction with the provincial governments and the local offices of the Trade Commission. If the tea is exclusively for domestic sale, the Trade Commission should issue a certificate, and the China Tea Company should declare it for transit. In addition, tung oil may be freely transported if it is transported to non-designated restricted transit areas in order to facilitate its flow. It has been found that when bristles统销 by the Central Trust Bureau are declared for transit within the central-controlled area, with a declaration that they will be re-exported to foreign countries in the future, and a certificate from the bureau is held, the transit tax should be waived and the goods released. However, when re-exported to foreign countries in the future, a transport permit must still be verified before release.</p>

<h3>Oil Market: Wild Fluctuations; Soybean Oil Rises After Falling; Blended Oil Quality Deteriorates; People Deceive People, Life Becomes More Difficult</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market continued the momentum from the previous day's close and rose after initially falling. The overall trend was entirely driven by speculation. As a result, the market surged by 6 to 9 yuan compared to the previous day. A total of ten barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded at a price of 110 yuan, sixty barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil were traded at prices of 100 yuan and 104 yuan, twenty barrels of Changzhou factory oil were traded at a price of 103 yuan, three hundred dan of Da You factory oil were traded at prices ranging from 82 yuan to 85 yuan, one hundred pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 80 yuan, one hundred and fifty pieces of Qingqi oil were traded at a price of 81 yuan, and one hundred pieces of Yanqi oil were traded at a price of 82 yuan. Currently, fluctuations of 5 to 6 yuan are not considered unusual. This is because, during this extraordinary period, those who make a fortune from the national crisis are mostly engaging in large-scale transactions, unlike in peacetime when they would strive for even a fraction of a cent. Therefore, seeking a livelihood on this isolated island requires a different perspective on price changes, which shows how difficult life is and how intense the deception among people has become.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is said that the price of raw soybean oil is rising while its quality is deteriorating, and the amount of adulteration is increasing. Adding white oil to raw oil has become an open secret. It is also said that soybean oil is adulterated with 20% cottonseed oil as soon as it leaves the factory. Once it reaches the market, more is added, sometimes up to 60%. This means that only 40% of the oil is soybean oil. When cottonseed oil was first processed by Da De, it was clarified using lime, which made it dry and hot. Adding it to other oils would worsen the condition of those with fever. However, if you use this oil to fry "youzhahui" (fried dough sticks), the dough sticks will be hard and not easily softened. Later, clam shell powder was used instead of lime, which made it more mild. (Special)</p>
<h3>Grain: Qingjiao and Thin Rice Favorable; Rice Market Active; Foreign Rice Rises by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, approximately 500 bags of 青档 thin rice were transported from the interior by automobile. Foreign rice continued to arrive at the port. After sales gradually became more active, yesterday local shops and restaurants all started buying early in the morning, resulting in brisk trading. Foreign rice had the best sales, so its price rose steadily despite the general decline. Although Saigon early rice still opened at 36.5 yuan, it closed at 37.2 yuan (see later notes), an increase of about half a yuan from the previous session. The prices of Yuanyangjian (蘆羊尖) followed suit, rising by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. Kejian (客尖) was still priced at 33 yuan due to restrictions, while 砯米 was priced at 31.5 to 32 yuan. High-quality thick粳 was still priced at 40 yuan, with mid-range goods also rising by about half a yuan. 稀胃 fragrant rice, a seasonal product, increased by more than one yuan. In the afternoon session, after the prices of all goods increased, both retail and wholesale sales became sluggish again, and the market returned to its original level. It is estimated that total sales in the city were no less than 7,000 to 8,000 bags. In short, the market has gradually returned to normal, and the market conditions have become clearer. In addition to normal transactions, speculators have all disappeared, and are only selling off the remaining goods in their hands. Therefore, although the market is very prosperous, rice prices are stable and do not experience the unlimited chaos of the past. Once the supply from the interior is smoothed out, rice prices will gradually return to a lower level.</p>
<p>Nearly 1,000 bags of new Kejian arrived. Although goods en route may continue to arrive in Shanghai in an endless stream, the cost of transportation from Jiangbei and other producing areas is difficult to meet, given the Shanghai price of 32 to 33 yuan. Therefore, the arrival of goods may gradually decrease in the future. The intention of Kejian hoarders to sell has become more firm. Influenced by the surge in foreign rice and the expansion of shop sales, mid-range Kejian has also been quietly raised by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. However, high-end goods are difficult to acquire for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Although orders for foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai, the price at the source has risen again yesterday, and the current stock is being rapidly digested as the business of the shops in this street has recovered and行客 and villagers are inquiring about it. The market has risen again, with the original 198-pound bag rising to 44.8 yuan, and the 160-pound market stone group rising from 36.8 yuan to 37.5 yuan, both increasing by more than one yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Weak; Wheat Prices High and Stable, Secondary Weak</h3>
<p>Flour: Sales in this street are still considered brisk, but sales to customers are still dull. The factories are only maintaining supply to meet the needs of this street, and the factory prices are not easy to raise repeatedly. The market has entered a stable period. The return of goods is also becoming invisibly weaker due to the sluggish sales to customers. The price of warehouse receipt goods is between 8.8 and 8.9 yuan, and the wholesale price in this street is still 8.7 yuan. The进出 volume of Japanese factory flour is low due to the approaching closure, and trading is stagnant. It is said that the opening price of Phoenix brand flour for December is 8.15 yuan, and for January, it is 8.46 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, supply and demand were low. The factories' demand has gradually decreased due to the recent sluggish sales of flour. Except for high-end acquisitions, mid-range wheat is no longer being acquired. Therefore, the market is high and stable, and secondary is weak. The total acquisition by factories in the city was only 3,000 bags, and the price remained at the original price of 15 yuan. It is said that 2 or 3 trucks of mid-range wheat were traded for warehouse delivery, and the price has been secretly lowered by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Rise Again</h3>
<p>The securities gray market was highly competitive between bulls and bears yesterday. Buyers were quite enthusiastic, and sellers were also very active. Judging from the trend on the surface, there is a sign of continued gains. Judging from the background of the sellers, they seem to be fearless. On the buyer side, the Japanese political parties, such as those led by Yoshizawa, have flatly stated that the Sino-Japanese War is not in the interests of either China or Japan. During this parliamentary session, the political parties are rumored to be taking big steps to seize power and restore the situation before Japan's invasion of China. The arrival in Shanghai of the British Consul in Osaka, White, to consult with the British ambassador, is said to involve matters related to China, Britain, and Japan. Foreign news also reports that the peace terms between China and Japan are close to agreement. The debt market may therefore experience major fluctuations. Throughout the day, the continuous selling of Da Kangcheng was the most noteworthy, while the buyers were all scattered. The涨势 was frustrated in the afternoon session due to the continuous sale of Da Kangcheng. The purchase of Shun Kang was not large. Retail investors' needs were strong. Da Kangcheng continued to sell in the afternoon session, in an even larger quantity. Shun Kang, Da Feng, Lianyi, and others purchased, and although the market price was slightly raised, the momentum was weak. Therefore, the transaction volume was approximately 800,000 yuan. The price of Ding-type shares rose uniformly by 0.15 to 0.45 yuan without any trading. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Stock Exchange's stock market was sluggish due to the trend of rubber futures and the strong concept of holidays, but prices remained very stable. Based on the above two factors, trading was inevitably sparse, but the actions of the buyers were excellent, which is a good sign that the market will expand after the holidays.</p>
<p>London, 21st: Today's listed prices of British companies in the Far East rose again. Jardine Matheson rose by three shillings and nine pence to eight pounds, eight shillings, and nine pence. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's London-registered shares rose by one pound to eighty-three pounds. Hong Kong-registered shares also rose by half a pound to eighty-five pounds. The Kailan Mining Administration rose by six pence to seventeen shillings and six pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 21st: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds only saw the Vickers Aircraft Loan rise by one pound to thirteen pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Finance: More Foreign Exchange Outflow Than Inflow</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC listing, with all exchange rates remaining flat. The grey market for British and American currencies was lackluster, showing a slight tendency towards loosening. Although Reuters teletype reported in the afternoon, based on observations from one side, that Sino-Japanese peace terms seemed to be gradually converging, this news was unremarkable and not taken seriously by speculators. The day began with flat opening rates. Shortly after, Hua Bank showed some buying interest, briefly tightening the market. However, incoming telegrams from Hong Kong and subsequent selling by merchants, coupled with Hua Bank's more outflow than inflow, led to a loosening trend. At that time, British gold was quoted at 4 shillings, 7 pence and 0.3125, and the US dollar at 7.71875 yuan. Later, importers seized the opportunity to purchase and settle, causing prices to stabilize. By the noon close, British gold was at 4 shillings, 6 pence and 0.6875, and the US dollar at 7.6875 yuan. The afternoon saw a quiet market, with only Hong Kong telegrams showing slight selling. The day closed with British gold at 4 shillings, 7 pence and 0.3125, and the US dollar at 7.71875 yuan, a decrease of 0.046875 and 0.0625 respectively compared to the previous day's closing. The futures market trend mirrored the spot market.</p>
<p>Continuous Selling from Hong Kong: Early morning saw London large bars with near-term shrinking by 0.0625 and deferred rates down by 0.125. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London raw gold remained flat. Exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai dollars, French francs, etc., were all flat. The US dollar fell by 0.0375 against the British pound, shrank by 0.05 against the Shanghai dollar, and slightly decreased by 0.0125 against the French franc. Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. Banks opened with spot selling prices of British gold at 4 shillings, 6 pence and 0.65625, and the US dollar at 7.65625 yuan, with no changes compared to the previous closing. After the opening, the market briefly tightened due to some buying interest from a certain Chinese bank, making it difficult to settle at the morning opening price. However, telegrams from Hong Kong soon arrived, and Hua Bank exporters followed suit with selling, causing the market to loosen. Hong Kong telegrams sold spot British gold at 4 shillings, 6 pence and 0.6875 to foreign banks. Hua Bank exporters also sold spot US dollars at 7.6875 yuan to a certain Chase Bank. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax slightly decreased by 0.005. Later, Tung Ya and Overseas Chinese two Chinese banks also sold spot British gold at 4 shillings, 7 pence and 0.0325 to foreign banks. Subsequently, foreign bank Sino-Belge also sold spot US dollars at 7.71875 yuan to a Chinese bank. Simultaneously, foreign bank Banque Franco-Chinoise also provided Hua Bank with January British gold at 4 shillings, 6 pence and 0.65625. Later, Hua Bank mutually traded January US dollars at 7.59375 yuan, slightly hardening the process. At noon, cotton and wheat merchants also settled accounts and mutually pulled in January US dollars with Chinese merchants and speculators, resulting in a stabilizing trend. Foreign banks Sino-Belge and Italian Bank settled at a price of 7.5625 yuan. By the noon close, bank spot selling prices were British gold at 4 shillings, 6 pence and 0.6875, and the US dollar at 7.6875 yuan, each decreasing by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Afternoon British Exchange Rate Unchanged: The afternoon market was exceptionally quiet, with no transactions reported for British exchange rates. Only Hong Kong telegrams sold spot US dollars to Banque Franco-Chinoise at a price of 7.71875 yuan. The market closed in a calm state. Bank spot selling prices were British gold at 4 shillings, 7 pence and 0.03125, and the US dollar at 7.71875 yuan. Next month's forward British gold was at 4 shillings, 6 pence and 0.671875, and the US dollar at 7.59375 yuan. The result was a decrease of 0.046875 for British gold and 0.0625 for the US dollar in the spot and forward markets compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British and American Currencies Unchanged: A telegram from Hong Kong on the 22nd stated that the exchange market opened flat this morning. British, American, and Japanese currencies all remained unchanged. Shanghai dollars decreased by 4 yuan to 316 yuan. The market opened flat at 11:30 AM and 2:30 PM, with no changes.</p>

Spot US dollars loosened by 0.0625 to 7.3125 yuan. "Joint Notes" in the grey market rose by 0.5 yuan to 92.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market saw a decline after a short period of prosperity. This was due to the foreign exchange market trending towards loosening and the Tianjin syndicate liquidating through a certain money exchange firm. Although the Hong Kong syndicate did not change its consistent approach, its buying interest was not as strong as in the previous two days. Most local retail investors adopted a wait-and-see policy due to the upcoming holidays, causing the market to loosen and decline. The final decrease was 18 yuan, although the morning opening was flat at 4,160 yuan, unchanged from yesterday. Later, the Tianjin syndicate heavily sold, and the foreign exchange market slightly hardened. Securities firms also sold into the market. Although the Hong Kong syndicate's buying interest was still good at that time, it was overwhelmed, causing the price to decline to a low of 4,140 yuan. Subsequently, the Hong Kong syndicate, unwilling to show weakness, commissioned a money exchange firm to support the market, and securities firms also bought back, causing the price to rise by 13 yuan. However, the Tianjin syndicate sold again shortly after, and buying interest was weak, causing the noon closing to be only 4,142 yuan. The afternoon saw an ordinary situation. Although securities firms returned to buy, they could not reverse the decline. The market closed at the same price as the noon closing. Total trading volume was over 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry prices remained fixed, and customs gold prices remained flat.</p>
<p>Tianjin Syndicate's Aggressive Selling in the Spot Gold Market: The market opened flat in the morning. Securities firms initially sold 30 taels to money exchange firms at 4,160 yuan. Shortly after, a certain money exchange firm suddenly liquidated on behalf of the Tianjin syndicate. Although the Hong Kong syndicate took the opportunity to commission a certain gold firm to buy, supply and demand remained unbalanced, and the foreign exchange market showed a loosening trend, decreasing by 10 yuan. Money exchange firms sold 20 taels to gold firms at 4,150 yuan. Later, a certain jewelry store bought in on behalf of customers, rising by 4 yuan, and bought 30 taels from money exchange firms at 4,154 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange market slightly hardened, and securities firms' selling pressure increased again. Money exchange firms continued to sell on behalf of the Tianjin syndicate, decreasing by 14 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to jewelry firms at 4,140 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange firm suddenly showed strong buying interest, buying over 200 taels, and securities firms also bought back, causing the price to rise by 13 yuan. Money exchange firms bought a total of 40 taels from jewelry firms and gold firms at 4,153 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange firm heavily sold again on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate, and buying interest weakened, causing the price to decrease by 11 yuan. A certain money exchange firm sold 50 taels to other firms at 4,142 yuan, which was the noon closing price. The afternoon opening decreased by 2 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 10 taels from securities firms at 4,140 yuan. Later, securities firms continued to buy, raising the price by 8 yuan. Money exchange firms mutually traded 20 taels at 4,148 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market slightly hardened, and jewelry firms sold slightly, decreasing by 6 yuan. Jewelry firms sold 20 taels to gold firms at 4,142 yuan, which was the evening closing price. The final decrease was 18 yuan compared to the previous day. The total daily fluctuation was 20 yuan. The selling price of cash gold firms was several yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current bid gold price was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and all transactions were completed.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Remained Unchanged: The selling price of gold jewelry remained fixed throughout the day. Ta Tung Hang remained at 420 yuan per tael, and the prices of new firms were the same. The buying price decreased by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply and demand for British and American gold pounds were balanced, and the market was stable. The trading of British and American gold drafts was not smooth, and market prices fluctuated with a slight downward trend. In the afternoon, the US dollar drafts were 13 yuan. In the evening, the atmosphere of peace prevailed, and the supply suddenly increased, causing the market to soften. The US dollar drafts sharply decreased to 12.88 yuan. Hong Kong drafts loosened due to the ample supply of Hong Kong exchange rates. The supply of Japanese gold drafts was very brisk, and the market was weak, with the evening price being 1.29 yuan. Korean drafts were also weak, with the evening price being 1.1005 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw a decrease of 0.25 yuan for British gold drafts, 0.21 yuan for US dollar drafts, and 0.02 yuan for Hong Kong drafts. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Authorities Control Prices, Sichuan Yarn Prices Cheaper Than Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market, which had been trending upwards, showed signs of stagnation. This was due to the increasingly quiet real demand and the waning interest of merchant syndicates. The inland authorities have intensified price controls, resulting in Sichuan yarn prices being lower than those in Shanghai, making it difficult to expand sales. With the Lunar New Year approaching, there is usually a period of closing. However, general "pigskin ball" trading remains vigorous, and the market is still lively, but actual progress is impossible, leading to stagnation.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn: The morning opening continued the firm momentum of the previous day, and some bids were very high. Two-horse brand yarn opened at 739 yuan. After this price was announced, general operators adopted a selling strategy due to the two-day rise, causing the firm momentum to change to weakness and a downward trend. News of foreign exchange loosening further dampened sentiment, and market prices gradually declined to a closing of 730 yuan. Statistics for the half-day trading volume show 1,895 bales traded, with two-horse brand 20-count yarn falling by 1.5 yuan and Heavenly Maiden brand falling by 3 yuan. Today, 36 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai and 250 pieces to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each syndicate is listed below: Domestic 1,770, Inland 40, Hong Kong 45, Ningbo 15, Fuzhou 10, Snow South 15, for a total of 1,895.</p>
<h3>Lunar New Year Approaching, Cotton Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Cotton trading remains scarce due to the approaching Lunar New Year and the impending closure of commercial activities. Therefore, domestic firms are also temporarily refraining from mutual buying and selling. As for factories, they are not actively seeking raw materials due to weak actual digestion of cotton yarn. Consequently, the market remains in a state of confusion. The sources from Northern Jiangsu include 2,653 bales of Tonghua cotton, 417 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 160 bales of Beisha cotton. The current state of spot cotton is listed below:</p>
<p>Wooden Frame Cotton: 160.50, 40 pieces bought by domestic firms</p>
<p>Again: 159.00, 90 pieces bought by domestic firms</p>
<p>South Pacific Cotton: 170.00, 190 bales bought by domestic firms</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton: 157.50, 22 bales bought by domestic firms</p>
<p>Tonghua Cotton: 164.50, 300 bales bought by domestic firms</p>
<p>Again: 161.00, 300 bales bought by domestic firms</p>
<p>Again: 160.00, 200 bales bought by domestic firms</p>
<p>Recently, cotton from Beisha in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been unable to be shipped to Shanghai due to unexpected obstacles, resulting in scarce imports. Yesterday afternoon, the British ship "Erebus" (transliteration) arrived, carrying a large amount of cotton from Bombay, totaling over 16,000 pieces or 4,400 tons. The ship docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou to unload. It is reported that most of this Indian cotton was purchased by Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>Another report on foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton market initially fell yesterday morning due to some Southern hedging sales, but then rebounded strongly due to active inter-dealer trading and purchases by overseas cotton merchants. The closing price was more than 20 points higher than the previous day. Indian cotton rose by 6 rupees, Egyptian cotton rose by over 20 points, and Liverpool cotton rose by 9 pence.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market is quiet due to the upcoming Christmas and New Year holidays, as various parties plan to temporarily close their books. Many who profited from the trading of New York Exchange futures contracts among domestic firms have recently settled their gains. However, the market has become quiet since yesterday, and they plan to decide on their next move after Christmas. The cotton market prices for yesterday, converted to factory prices at a US exchange rate of 7.625, are as follows:</p>
<p>20-count American Middling: 239.10</p>
<p>Again, Lower Grade: 224.70</p>
<p>32-count, American Middling: 246.10</p>
<p>Again, Lower Grade: 139.95</p>
<p>42-count, American Middling: 149.60</p>
<p>Again, Lower Grade: 241.70</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Sales to Sichuan and Yunnan Show Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>There is still strong current demand for cotton cloth from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Nanyang syndicates, and Sichuan and Yunnan syndicates are also showing signs of improvement. Local firms are keenly searching for available goods in the market due to high factory prices, causing market prices to soar. Jardine Matheson's coarse and fine cloth, twill, and bleached cloth have each risen by 0.25 to 0.5 yuan per piece. Lun Chang Factory's satin floral cloth has risen by 0.5 yuan per piece. Hua Factory's various goods have also increased in price by 0.1 to 0.25 yuan. Over 500 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, coarse and fine twill bleached and dyed, and printed cloth were traded on this street. Zhejiang and Jiangxi syndicates traded over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and fine cloth. Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong syndicates purchased 170 to 180 pieces of coarse twill, fine cloth, and colored cloth. Overseas Singapore and other places purchased over 5,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, and printed cloth. On the 23rd, 75 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin and 242 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth was weak in the morning but firm in the afternoon, with a continuing upward trend. White goods, Longtou fine cloth, closed at 21.45 yuan per piece in the morning. In the afternoon, trading was brisk due to domestic firms' optimistic outlook, with over 1,000 pieces of fine cloth traded. The Tianjin syndicate purchased several hundred bales, and selling prices gradually increased. The closing was even stronger, with Longtou fine cloth at 21.6 yuan, Sijunzi serge at 0.655 yuan per yard, and Zhigong at 0.695 yuan. The market opened with 400 bales of Longtou, Laba, Blue Phoenix, and Blue Chicken brand fine cloth for next month's delivery. The opening price for Laba, Blue Phoenix, and Blue Chicken was 21.25 yuan per piece.</p>
<h3>Horse Mane Satin in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen market was thriving. Public tea houses were bustling, and the market was still firm on the 19th. Horse mane satin, used for making overcoat sleeves, was selling exceptionally well and was in short supply, making it quite firm. Prices soared by over 0.1 yuan per yard. The wholesale price for the top grade was 1.6 yuan, the second grade was 1.3 yuan, the third grade was 1.05 yuan, and the fourth grade was 0.975 yuan. Market inventory is scarce, and factories have mostly stopped weaving due to high raw material costs, making it unprofitable. However, actual sales are still on the rise, so there is a high possibility of further price increases in the future.</p>
<h3>All Woolens Speculating</h3>
<p>Recently, the most active woolen trading has been on this street, and all market prices are firm. Spring and summer goods, which are in demand for the Lunar New Year, have seen even greater price increases. Domestic firms are speculating on their inventory. Currently, camel silk brocade horse riding cloth and Western goods are generally selling at 22 yuan, domestic goods at 12.3 to 16.7 yuan, and Eastern goods at 11.2 yuan. Polish-made all-wool overcoat cloth is 20 yuan for the top grade, 18 yuan for grades 1 and 2, 16.5 yuan for grade 3, and 11 yuan for grade 4. Mercerized silk-gloss yarn is 1.1 yuan, serge twill-flower yarn is 9 yuan, Hongsheng all-wool black charcoal is 3.5 yuan, Zhilun yarn wool black charcoal lining is several yuan, and Sanai soft lining is 1.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Temporarily Watching</h3>
<p>The silk market is stable and in good condition. Yokohama's spot prices have risen by 25 yuan, and forward prices have risen by 32 yuan. New York's spot prices have slightly declined, with near-term rising by 0.1 yuan and forward prices opening flat. Local white factories have not started selling 78%. The RR price is 6,100 yuan, with no gains or losses. Because Christmas is approaching, foreign merchants are all watching the silk market, so the domestic silk market is unlikely to change much and will remain stable this year.</p>
<p>Wuxi's silkworm farming industry is renowned. Previously, the price of fresh cocoons was very low, with each dan (unit of weight) only worth over 20 yuan. Farmers were frustrated and converted mulberry fields into rice fields. However, this year, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the rising price of silk, the price of fresh cocoons has also soared. Spring cocoons are sold for 80 to 120 yuan per dan, autumn cocoons for 130 to 270 yuan, and late autumn cocoons for 270 to 320 yuan. Farmers are delighted with this unexpected selling price and expect the silkworm farming industry to be even more prosperous next year.</p>
<p>As for Wuxi's silk reeling factories, they are also very numerous. Before the war, there were over 40, but after the war, most could not start work. Therefore, small silk factories were established one after another, generally called family silk factories. They do not have machines and use wooden looms to reel silk, which is the old-fashioned silk reeling method. These small silk factories are mostly located near the city and also spread to the countryside. Some estimate that there are over 100, with small capital but huge profits, and are also a newly emerging industry after the war. (Person)</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Dust Price Increase Intensifies</h3>
<p>Recently, various types of coal dust have seen strong customer sales, with water shops, stoves, and blacksmith shops all consuming them. However, there is no source of supply, and sellers are holding on to their goods, intensifying the grey market. Yesterday, the quoted price for Kailuan No. 2 dust was 80 yuan, but there was no large-scale supply. Huashui dust is completely out of stock, and other lower-grade dusts have also increased in price, with a rise of 7-8 yuan in the past week.</p>

<h3>Exposure and Satire</h3>
<p>— Wen Ge</p>
<p>The vast real world has the noble, as well as the despicable; the light, as well as the darkness. While it is necessary to indicate and praise the noble and the bright, we cannot forget to expose and satirize the despicable and the dark. The purpose of indication and praise is to encourage us to continue moving forward, while the focus of exposure and satire is to raise our vigilance.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the so-called exposure and the so-called satire are slightly different in the degree of portrayal; generally speaking, the former is more explicit and intense, while the latter is more subtle and gentle. But this does not mean that the two can be mechanically separated; in practice, they are often used in combination. For example, Lu Xun's The True Story of Ah Q contains both deeply exposed scenes of the ugliness of a collapsing feudal society and gently satirical words about people who only engage in speculation.</p>
<p>In the past, some people seemed to regard exposure and satire as revealing people's private affairs and scolding them abusively. In fact, the latter is merely a kind of "shrew's curse." The occurrence of exposure and satire will never be without cause, and that foundation is reality.</p>
<p>In order to use this means with the utmost correctness, we cannot be satisfied with merely exposing the surface of various uglinesses, but should strike directly at their core with the spirit of sweeping the court and clearing the lair; only by crushing their core will the ugliness be fundamentally shaken.</p>
<p>If viewed from a historical perspective, good exposure and satire are often typical, rather than being frozen on so-called "personal attacks," such as Goncharov's Oblomov, Lu Xun's Ah Q, and Cervantes' Don Quixote.</p>
<p>I remember a gentleman once saying: "Typical creation is the consistent glorious legend in literature and art. Judging the value of a novel or play, the success or failure of typical creation is often a standard." Indeed, in order for exposure and satire to have an effective influence and to avoid detours, we should first extract common characteristics from the various phenomena and essences of the despicable and the dark, shape them into a typical form, and then attack them.</p>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese War, the number of literary themes that praise the bright and the noble has increased dramatically, and many writers have devoted themselves to writing in this area, which is absolutely the right thing to do. However, some people have drawn the conclusion from this that "we have been hoping for this great era to come every day; now that it has arrived, we should naturally praise it to our heart's content. If we are still stuck on exposure and satire, it will not only let down this praiseworthy era, but also shake the confidence of some people." That is a bit arbitrary, although the intention of the person who said this can be said to be "utter devotion to the country," but I believe that the current situation is indeed very clear, but those reactionary and corrupt forces still exist and must be severely attacked, so in order to avoid future worries and make the foundation of our praise more solid, we can only cleanse them by exposing and satirizing them.</p>
<h3>Evening Meeting—A Record of Ashes Gathered—</h3>
<p>— Tang Wei</p>
<p>The sky was gradually turning to evening, and the cold wind was scraping dry sounds on the eaves. The night was deep and hostile, crowding against the window.</p>
<p>The tailor's mother was a tall woman in her forties. She always frowned as if she had just stopped crying, and no trace of joy could be found on her face. She paced back and forth in the room, but every place she went, she only touched it unnecessarily and then walked away.</p>
<p>The tailor was a young lad who did not resemble his mother at all. He was very handsome, and when he spoke, a hot, prickly smile always covered his face. We sat in their bedroom and kitchen, a small room where everything, except for the lamplight - the bed, the utensils, the table, the stools - was the same color of dimness.</p>
<p>After the fully bearded worker came, our evening meeting began.</p>
<p>The tailor poured five bowls of white water and sat down next to the elementary school teacher. The teacher was small and wore very heavy glasses. He reported on the anti-× work in the Zhengyang River District educational community for the past month in a cat-like meow.</p>
<p>The bearded man pressed his burly chest tightly against the corner of the table, staring intently at the teacher's moving lips. Another skinny girlfriend sat further away from the table, because she was too weak, frowning tightly or fidgeting.</p>
<p>At first, the tailor's mother seemed oblivious to our actions; when the bearded man reported, she leaned close behind him, shrouded in a layer of hard-to-explain mystery, like a funeral.</p>
<p>"Hey, speak up a little!"</p>
<p>The bearded man leaned forward, his voice even lower.</p>
<p>I looked at her, then looked at the tailor, embarrassed.</p>
<p>"It's okay, she can't hear!" the tailor replied in a low voice.</p>
<p>I had known for a long time that her ears were very deaf, but for some reason I was always annoyed by her.</p>
<p>After a while.</p>
<p>"Damn it, what's the matter with speaking louder?"</p>
<p>She poked the bearded man's back with her finger and walked away angrily.</p>
<p>The girlfriend's report was very simple, and many of her words were absurd and unfounded. We criticized her for "stalling work," and after everyone discussed it, we decided to find another girlfriend to help her.</p>
<p>Next, we discussed the book that we had decided to read in advance. The tailor first reported an outline, and then we discussed it based on his outline. Sometimes it went smoothly, and sometimes we argued until our faces were red. Later, we finally reached a conclusion.</p>
<p>- Your opinions do not conflict, but only speak of the two aspects of the issue. When combined, they are a complete answer.</p>
<p>We handed out the newspapers that we had brought to them, and it was already past eleven o'clock when the meeting broke up.</p>
<p>"If you have clothes to wash, bring them tomorrow!" The tailor's mother instructed the bearded man as he was leaving.</p>
<h3>To Those Who Sigh About Life</h3>
<p>— Kang Min</p>
<p>The day I ran into you, you really looked much more haggard! On your young face, the shadow of the unrelenting whip of life was clearly visible. I truly felt sorry for you, I sympathized with you.</p>
<p>You told me many distressing things, pouring them out like a woman lamenting her troubles. This surprised me greatly. To think that before the war, you were such a stubborn and strong person! You never used to complain to others about the hardships of your life. You always held your disheveled head high, a youthful arrogance on your gaunt face. From this, one could see a kind of vitality that made people like you, not because of your tattered clothes, but because of the vitality of your youth!</p>
<p>But yesterday, after seeing you in that beggar-like state of complaining, I only felt pity for you. I am truly sorry, I pitied you as one would pity a beggar! I even felt a kind of contempt for you welling up inside me.</p>
<p>You told me how painful your life is, how your wife is often sick, and how your child is so gluttonous, and when he sees the neighbor's children eating meat and fish, he cries out for them too. You feel sorry for your child, but you also get angry at your child. In the end, the pain of life infuriates you, and you cruelly beat your child. Afterward, you regret it, you hold your child and cry, and you take the few clothes you have in your chest and pawn them to buy meat and fish for your child to eat. But when eating meat and fish, you also become greedy, and you actually compete with your child for those rare and delicious 'delicacies'!</p>
<p>Alas, what has made you become such a person? You shamelessly said those pitiful words. I saw your dull eyes filled with tears. It's not that I'm cruel and don't show any sympathy for others, especially for you, who could be said to be an old friend as close as siblings, but at that moment, I really frowned at you a little.</p>
<p>You started complaining again, saying that you are a student of a national university, now working as a middle school teacher earning only thirty cents an hour, and being looked down upon everywhere. You waved your thin, bony hand, as if wanting to shatter something, but then you sighed about the pain of your life: "This is not a life a human being should live! It's worse than a pig's life!"</p>
<p>Old friend! Your expansive personality has now become so timid. I wonder what has turned you into that! But it's better for you to be stubborn, because if you keep lamenting the pain of your life everywhere, your life will still be painful, and it won't get better just because you lament!</p>
<p>Gorky, in a letter to a young man named P.A. Tolavkin, said: "Don't lament the pain of life – lamenting is for the weak!..." There was a time when I also lamented the pain of my own life to others, but what did I get? Empty and false comfort, and from these empty and false comforts, I saw people's contempt for me. Later, talking about these words of Gorky made me realize that "people must respect themselves, must say to everyone with pride: I am a person like you..." Yes, only in this way will people respect us and not despise us!</p>
<p>Now is the time to endure hardship, we must get through this painful stage! Don't you see? The light of dawn is already shining not far ahead! Although this light is only a drop, as long as we grit our teeth and do not lament the painful life, we must be like the Volga boatmen, singing that tragic song and moving forward, this drop of light will illuminate you and me, no, the lives of all the Chinese people!</p>
<p>Don't lament the pain of your life!</p>
<h3>Mourning Guan Hua</h3>
<p>— Luo Sha</p>
<p>If it is said that in the fighting human world, emotions cannot be completely annihilated by bloodshed, then it is the deep sorrow for the death of a comrade-in-arms. Guan Hua: The tears that I had long forgotten, I swallow for you today from afar.</p>
<p>Opening the dust-covered old days, that long line of roads once walked for friendship, the memory corroded by purple bloodstains is still so clear, but it can no longer be pieced together with calm thinking.</p>
<p>That's you! Step by step, you approached the monument of truth, and laboriously dug at the roots of the thorny execution ground, and then faced the cliff in the way and made a resounding blow with your life. — There is a golden plain, there is a small river, that is where your life's footsteps have long resided. The desolate autumn countryside is so cold, but it is also the season of harvest, every plump grain of rice should be stained with your blood. A certain scene flashed through my mind, as if I saw you lying down in the freezing cold smoke, your breath stopped, but still stubbornly holding your head high like an iron jaw...</p>
<p>It seems that I saw your last leap again, still shouting with such passionate voice: "Come, take up my gun!..."</p>
<p>Yes, we must take up the gun you left behind! The hissing and roaring of the underground fire is a powerful oath!</p>
<p>Look, this is the mighty team coming to avenge you, acting with the bright red battle flag lowered before your grave. (to be rewarded)</p>
<h3>The Birth of Jesus and Society (Continued)</h3>
<p>(5) The Lost Sheep Returns: At the beginning of the first century, when the Jews were subjugated by the Roman Empire, both politics and religion were corrupt and dark, the people were suffering and disappointed, displaced, like lost sheep without a shepherd. Jesus, that most virtuous shepherd, was born into this world, originally to seek and save the lost sheep, often befriending sinners, calling sinners to return. He said: Healthy people do not need a doctor, I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to be saved. Whenever Jesus saw the fleeing crowds, he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, so he healed them, preached to them, and gave them the bread of life. Those poor, sick, fallen, and helpless people all gladly approached Jesus to receive his comfort and teaching. Even a prostitute from the fiery pit also rushed to Jesus, giving all she had to offer to Jesus, expressing her gratitude. The parable of the prodigal son's return home and the repentance of the adulterous woman are all portrayals of saving lost sheep. Since our country suffered from the war, refugees and disabled soldiers, widows and orphans are everywhere, full of scars and incomplete. In addition, politics is in disarray, bandits take advantage of the situation, unemployment is rife, poverty prevails, people cannot guarantee their lives from morning to night, and the society is shaking. We hope that Jesus will come and show great compassion, saying to us: I have come that you may have life, and have it to the full.</p>
<p>(6) To Set the Captives Free: Jesus opposed war, especially wars of aggression, because he said: Humanity is one family, the world is one family, how can we kill each other? "A house divided against itself cannot stand," only by loving each other can we have eternal life. When there is inequality in the world, evil systems in society, and selfishness in human beings, there are wars of aggression and oppression, creating the shape of hell. Jesus came into the world to change hell into heaven, so he opposed war and opposed all kinds of evil systems, to reorganize morality and elevate personality, saying to the aggressors: Those who are captured are your compatriots, you should treat them well and return their freedom and sovereignty. You think you are the victorious country, but you must not rely on strength and arrogance, you should help the weak nations. If you do not help them, you have lost your divine duty. If you invade and plunder them, what is your heart like? ·(To be continued)</p>

<h3>From My Daughter's Reading, I Thought of Soviet Children's Theaters (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>Seeing the comparison table of living index between now and then on the newspaper, and recalling my current difficult situation, plus the "wise helpmate" is not good at household production, I can't help but feel worried and afraid, as if I'm about to fall into a deep abyss! I had to take out Hitler's wrist and immediately order the dissolution of the small family! I sent her to live in the countryside, and I temporarily assumed the position of "child's mother". From the newly cleared rain, the misty waves, as if a "good dream is just awakening and stretching" on the Xupu River, I drove a small boat to bid farewell and came back, holding this girl, Li Ning, who has parents as if she has no parents, wandering and kicking on Changbang Road, the "Ning's education problem in the future" lingers in my mind. Thinking about it, I can't always get a proper solution! Should I send her to a boarding school? I am afraid that this expense cannot be raised by me, a "parasite" who has been idle for a long time! What's more, modern education - especially on isolated islands - is mostly fertilized with money. Two more legal tender, and there are two more courses. For children of poor families like me, we can only sigh at this "commercialized school"!</p>
<p>Therefore, I thought of the popularity of compulsory education I saw when I traveled to the Soviet Union with Mr. Huanhua in previous years, and even more recalled the situation of visiting the children's theater at that time. I was walking in front of a dilapidated bookstore near the Great World, and in that bundle of woodcut steles, I took out a volume of "Feiyingge Pictorial". The order is messy, scattered and incomplete, about two hundred pages. I spent a dollar to buy it back. -Feiyingge Pictorial was made by Wu Ren Zhou Muqiao Yuanhe and Wu Jiayou and others. Zhou Muqiao was originally a graphic artist for "Dianshizhai Pictorial" and was famous at the time. He once responded to the call of Zeng Zhongxiang to draw a picture of the battle deeds of the meritorious ministers who put down the Cantonese bandits, presented it to the emperor for review, and was greatly praised. Feiyingge Pictorial was founded in the ninth month of Guangxu Gengyin, which is now fifty years ago. The drawings are all local news, neighborhood scenes, and ladies' costumes at that time. —</p>
<p>In this volume of pictorial, there is exactly one page that draws puppet shows - Taiping Amusement Park No. 8 - there are no adult men among the audience, all are women and children. The children's theater we visited in the Soviet Union also performed puppet shows. Is it probably that all puppet shows are only for the appreciation of women and children? (The original picture is printed above)</p>
<h3>Feiyingge Pictorial - Puppet Show</h3>
<h3>"San Niang Teaches Her Son" on the Screen ()</h3>
<p>Famous actors Yan Jupeng's children Huizhu and Shaopeng, etc., recently filmed a "San Niang Teaches Her Son" in Beiping. Although the performance is not Yan Jupeng, almost everything is handled by him. The film is completely adapted from the old drama and has now been completely filmed. It is heard that the film will be released in Shanghai soon after it is released in the Pingjin area.</p>
<h3>Famous Bengbeng Opera Star Bai Yushuang Gets Married in Ping and Retires...No More Performances</h3>
<p>— Chen Chang</p>
<p>Speaking of Bai Yushuang, Shanghai people have a very deep impression. She is a famous star of Bengbeng Opera. Since she sang obscene operas in Beiping in March of the 25th year, she was expelled from the country by the municipal government, and then immediately brought her entire troupe to Shanghai to perform. Because this kind of opera is very suitable for the taste of ordinary people in Shanghai, it was very popular when it was staged in various theaters. Then she also filmed a film with Bengbeng Opera as the theme, "Begonia Red", with Bai as the protagonist. Because the results were still good, it was quite a sellout. At that time, Bai had been on stage at the Empire Theater for several months in a row, and one night, Bai suddenly eloped to Tianjin with the Qin player Gu Baokui, so the theater had a lawsuit in court with Bai's brother because the contract had not expired. Although the theater won the lawsuit, the protagonist had already flown away, so it had to end in nothing. After Bai arrived in Tianjin, she continued to perform in the old pavilions Cuixianglou and Lengxiangyuan. Recently, news came that Bai was officially married at the Xinya Restaurant in Beiping on a certain day of this month, but the groom was not the Qin player who eloped with her, but the son of a local wealthy businessman Zhu Hongkui. The wedding day indeed caused a sensation among the people in the entire old capital. Now she has decided to retire from the stage from now on.</p>

<h3>Magazine (3)</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain lady, Changshi, came to visit Yu because her gaozhan was recently in love with a dancer, saying that she had read the article on love in the 44th issue of this journal, and felt that it contained great truths. Now, what method should she use to intervene in order to make her good man wake up and turn back? Yu said, (56) Do you know the meaning of freedom? Freedom is to be exercised as much as possible within the scope of oneself, and no interference in the freedom of others is allowed. From afar, there is Gandhi's hunger strike in India, and from near, there are strikes by workers in the business community. These are all exercising freedom within their own scope, and finally achieving their intended purpose. As far as love is concerned, the two words love are both from the heart, originate from the heart and are expressed outwardly. Therefore, even if you have force, you can tie up your good man's feet, but you cannot tie up his heart. His love will never belong to you, so why do you love his body? Military strategy takes attacking the heart as the best strategy. To attack the heart, one should first serve the things that he likes, and never express the things that he hates. If you can do this, and do it for years, your good man will definitely abandon the affair and return to you.</p>
<p>Jin Didi of Datong City was orphaned at a young age and raised by Jin Lili's mother. At that time, Lili's father was still working in the soybean and wheat industry, and his brother was also serving in the military. The family had enough food and clothing, and they didn't want to let their daughter work as a dance partner at first. Later, the family fell into decline, so Lili became a dance partner. Didi also followed her sister into Datong City. Guests sometimes disliked her youth, and the income from dance tickets was not very abundant. Recently, she has grown up a bit, and her beauty has surpassed her sister's, so more and more people are interested in her. Unexpectedly, she is very ambitious and suddenly ran away. Yesterday, I met this Lili and told Yu that she had not eaten for two days, and her chest was filled with depression, and she couldn't sleep at night. The lawyer's letter from Didi was full of bloody language. Lili is filial to her mother, and her mother is worried about her too. Why is it so! However, Didi is not yet an adult and cannot stand on her own legally. The one who induced her can make her sever the affection of many years of upbringing, and his cruelty can be known. Then in the future, it is also difficult to guarantee that he will not sever affection with Didi.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, and the dance halls are mostly decorated ostentatiously. It is heard that the reservations are quite enthusiastic. Is it because they want to have fun all night to celebrate? I think that excessive enjoyment is like singing across the river, deliberately hurting the time, and it is also like the worries of the people of Qi. How it is on weekdays, then how it is still, that is close to it.</p>
