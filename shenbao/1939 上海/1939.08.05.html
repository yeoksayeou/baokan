<h3>哈里法克斯外相闡明　英國遠東政策要點　願為中日戰爭覓取解決方案　實事求是處理天津事件背景</h3>
<p>英外相哈里法克斯勳爵</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日上院辯論外交時、外相哈立法克斯勳爵曾發演說、希望將來必有一日、英國有利用其斡旋之機會、而使中日戰爭獲得公允之解決、外相謂渠信覔取一種以公道待遇中國、同時並顧及其他與遠東有關係的列强利益之解決、非好意的人力所不能及、外相評駁一般人對於最近英日所簽方案之誤解、並重行申明英政府對華之政策未有更變、至於政府所行之一切、乃爲承認似已存在之事實、並岡以實際的方法、應付天津局勢所由發生之背景、</p>
<p>力為東京協定辯護</p>
<p>外相爲政府作答曰、下院各部分所發之演說數起認英國最近與日本簽訂之方案、已使國家在政策上有根本之更變、吾人之定此種方案、乃承認中國交戰狀態之存在、此爲違反吾人在國聯決議案下應有的義務之精神、此有侵犯丸國公的之危險、總之、政府旣作此舉、則對於吾人往日所祇責之一切行動、悉予寬恕矣、凡此皆詆責政府之言也、余願以絕坦白之態度聲明者、就余之決斷　彼作此種議論者、對於方案之明白條款與政府對此方案所作之解釋、悉漠然置　不顧也、外相謂、就渠前在印度所得之經騐、深知安坐倫敦之人士、在一方面或他方面衡量方任何措詞審愼之方案中所含凖確之意義、實覺非常國難之情形、職是之故、敵人之欲在小麥田中　種莠草、殊難得較此更腴之土、彼對方案作此種散漫之責言者、實漠視一種甚重要之事實、即渠於該下午聞責言所發生之印象、正爲彼切欲增進英國目前所遭任何困難者所願見其發生之印象、故施責者確須謹愼而勿爲人所愚弄、今對東實至小之基礎、造作至大之疑慮、苟循此方針而進行、實不能有所裨益、</p>
<p>英日談判目的有二</p>
<p>眾當牢記心頭者、日政府從未申請英政府更變其一般政策、如日政府果有此請、英政府亦決不能出此、英國藉此方案所巳行者、爲聲明似已存在之一切事實、並圖以實際的方式、應付天津局勢所因以發生之背景、今苟不將誤解列諸方案、則天津爭案殊難獲得妥協、克萊琪爵士（駐日英大使）今方以堅決精神與諒解、應付甚困難之情勢、以作獲得解決之努力、政府必須勿以無謂之言行、增難共工作、故政府前所已行者、旣未有近於侵迫性質之行動、渠望政府今後在仟何合理的事故上、亦不應且不能出此行動、政府之政策雖志在增進和平與國際秩序、然政府之所努力者、其目的有二焉、第一最要者、為覓取一種對有關係各方面皆稱公允之解決、次為就黃國利益較狹之觀察點、在目前困難中求得不損害英國與巾國或日本間關係之結果、渠深知下院許多議員必認此爲一種過其樂觀之希望、渠本人則覺吾人能否成功達到目的問題、不全賴吾人自己、此叭賴日政府之態度、與夫日當局如何準備分別彼等政府所已承認之地方事件與一般事件、並如何準備不　認一般事件爲地方事件、認地方事件爲一般事件、</p>
<p>反英運動具嚴重性</p>
<p>外相次述及最近日首相平沼接待新聞記者所發之言論、謂據克萊琪爵士來報、所傳多誤、如平沼之言果屬誤傳、則政府不能接受其言論中所含之意義、英政府對於天津之被封鎖、與日軍在華所佔區域內反英運動之有增無已、不得不取甚嚴重之見解、如此項運動繼續不已、則英日兩國間之關係、靴免遂步更形國難、渠意日本朝野必須承認此點、英日方案中曾規定日政府對日軍在華所佔區域之公安、負有維持之責任、故英政府能盼望利用用此種方案、制止此項區域內之反英宣傳、此點殊値得記憶者英政府並當記憶所提出之爭點數種、雖屬地方性質、而實有更廣大之意義、且與其他政府有直接關係、</p>
<p>仍保持與美法接觸</p>
<p>吾人曾述及對於數事與美法兩國有共同之利益、總之、三國政府之目的的實密切相同、英政府甚注重此三政府間之合作、凡吾人之意志與動作、無不隨時通吿美法政府、此非謂英美法三國當於同時取同樣行動、最近美國關於商的之談判、即可爲一例證也、余深知英政府在目下之環境中、亦可宣吿廢止其對日之商的、但誠如首相星期一日所云、此事需要極縝密之考慮、且有與各自治領密切交換意見之必要、故余不擬在此階段、對此事再有所陳述、</p>
<p>認識日本在華地位</p>
<p>外相决又述及國聯同志會副會長台維斯勳爵所發政府行動係被堅持舊有權利之願望所左右一語、謂彼應勿忽視本年初英政府所致日本之牒文中曾有一段、係請其注意英國遠在一九三一年時、已一與中國政府從事領事裁判權之談判幾吿完成、後以日人侵奪滿洲始行停止、惟於致日牒文中、繼續聲明英政府仍凖備於適當時期、賡續此項談判、並已預備俟恢復和平、與完全獨立之中國政府討論此類及其他問題、故英政府之形成其政策、並無保持舊條的方法全部結構於不變之意存乎其間、同時英政府對於日本在華之行動、從未隱蔽其意見、吾人對於日本因共地理的地位及經濟的需要而要求之特殊利益與地位、已充分凖備予以承認云、</p>
<p>穩定法幣研究辦法</p>
<p>外相續稱、關於中國法幣及處置天津存銀之問題、加已有各種解決辦法、但似均不能令人滿意、英政府現正繼續檢討一切可能性、但吾人在考慮此項事件之時、自不能忽視吾人對於中國政府及九國公的其他簽字各國所負之義務、關於繼續支持中國法幣事之任何提議、不論其由中國之見地上、是吾認爲需要、吾人亦將就目前英國所有之許多其他金融上之考慮及義務、而予以考慮、</p>
<p>重視英武官被扣案</p>
<p>外相又稱、關於現被張家口日當局扣留之英武官史比亞上校事、極令人感覺不滿、克萊琪爵士曾屢向日政府交涉、據日方答覆謂、此案殆已調査完竣、數日前日政府曾宣稱、希望此案不久即可解決、日方對於史氏之長期被扣並無說明、英政府已將共對此事之感覺向日方明白表示矣、至於史氏之享有外交特權、自屬毫無問題云、</p>
<p>外相結論表示希望</p>
<p>外相結束其演鑒、鑒於目下在遠東之種種困難情形、各方負責之人物自應負有瞻望前途、並清除其當前之障碍、以達到眞正目的之責任、在述東方面、此項目的、並非如前外交决官薛西爾動爵之所提議、關於途徑之採取、似較薜氏所見及者、有更廣大之後果及校大之危險、但必須予以嘗試、以便使現時之糾紛、獲得公允之解決、渠希望將來必有一日、英國有利用其幹旅之機會、而使中日戰爭獲得公允之解決、並信覓取一種以公道待遇中國、同時並顧及共他與遠東有關係的列强利益之解决、非好意的人力所不能及云、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英上院議員　質問情形</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英上院今日關於遠東局勢之辯論、首由反對派領袖史尼爾勳爵發言、謂遠東局勢似仍令人失望、渠非謂英國獨負共責、惟東京方案成立之迅速、遠不似莫斯科談話進行之遲緩、此乃渠所不能小爲之驚異者也云、</p>
<p>國聯同志會主席薜西爾動爵繼起發言云、渠對於首相張伯倫所稱公允解决中日戰爭一語、甚不感興奮、渠意由此可見政府方面對於此决戰事，已有置中日於同等地位之傾向、渠信日本之仗略、乃世界歷史中極不正當之事件、日本之目的係欲先控制中國、次及亞洲而排除一切歐洲國家及人民於亞洲任何部份或商業之外、日本軍閥政策與德國現政策彼此相同、其故殆以日本軍閥受德人之訓練、德人不獨授以軍事上技能、且灌輸對於政府與國際事件之觀念也、渠希望外相將英政府關於美國通吿廢止一九一一年美日商的事、究擬採行何等平行步驟吿知上院、渠願政府對於遠東政策發表更切實而更明白之說明、首相之言使人對於何者、眞爲英國遠東政策、不能無疑、政府應表示不以日本報復爲懼、日本已表明其對於一切國際義務與一切公道原則悍然不顧之態度、而中國則已履行其全部義務、且一切行動絕對適宜、渠以爲如英國採行利於日本實利於中國之行動、則將貽英國之羞、而有委棄共行爲大値得援助的國家之象、渠知英國在遠東領土或將遭遇海軍之攻擊、此在英國固覺爲難、但英國所必須考慮者、如日木在華勝利、則其可能性爲何如乎、果爾、則英國所有者、將被掃除無遺、蓋日木既已摧毁中國、定將向摧毀英國也、就渠與日本外交交涉而得之經騐而言、渠知對日每一讓步、徒惹日木要求無厭而已云、台維斯勳爵發言謂、英國應以各種方法贊助中政府、而於必要時驅逐住於英帝國內之日僑、並斷絕對日之經濟關係云、前內務大臣　繆爾勳爵起稱、政府宜說明其所宜布關於東京方案之言論、適用於贊助中國法幣之必要、今中國幣制已成英日爭持中之最重要點、遠東之困難大都起於日本政府之離異的兩重政治、日本政治家常爲軍閥所壓倒、而軍閥復爲其低級軍官所挾持、英帝國決未有容許其自己政策爲日本陸軍中上校與少校等强暴行爲所左右之理由、吾人現有種種理由可信日本在其征服中國之努力中、已感痛苦之失望、日本在過去兩年中有怨憤與恐慌之情緒、如人之陷於泥淖中逐漸沒頂者然、日本軍閥自覺必須覔一代人受過者、以發洩怨憤恐慌之情緒、而英國現乃爲替罪羊矣、美國旣移其艦隊由大西洋而至太平洋、復廢止對日商的、此二舉皆有甚重要意義、共動機不僅爲其自已在遠東利益、</p>
<h3>英公司承印　中國紙幣　逾十萬萬張</h3>
<p>（倫敦）中國政府及中央銀行、已與英國印鈔公司兩家訂立合同託印紙幣、共逾十萬萬張、確實總數或紙幣價値、均不能披露、其中一家已僱額外工人四百名以資應付、復須一年始能完畢其合同、另一合同則已吿畢、印刷原版將保留於英國、紙幣將循各路綫運往中國、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>亦以對世界一般之責任應如是也、美國廢的事未可謂爲純屬商業理由、無疑的含有政治意味、英政府在此種環境中、大可受其鼓勵而不採用遇壓力則屈服之任何政策、有一事應當在英政府考慮中者、爲澳洲在太平洋一切問題中、尤共是在英日關係中有絕大之利害關係、常中國東三省事件發生時、澳洲之利益確然具有左右英政府思慮之重大勢力、渠切盼澳洲朝野可了解時常退讓之政策、終非善計、亦非可與英帝國威望或利益相適合之道、政府現已設法加强新加坡防務、此乃可歡迎者、如東京會議不成、而日方壓力有增無减、則政府宜考慮採行如美國所已行之同樣行動如政府決定有早十二個月通知廢止英日商的之需要、則全國人民定贊助之、如是、英國有會同美國以甚有效的經濟壓力加諸日木之工具、當可停止對日之供給、日本無此供給、則雖欲繼續作戰亦不可能也云前澳洲總督史頓海文勳爵、因薩繆爾勳爵言論中有涉及澳洲之處、特起而爲澳洲辯護、謂須知澳洲爲英帝國全部利益計、確曾犧牲其對日之甚重要貿易云、薩繆爾勳爵答稱、渠非謂澳洲爲自己利益計、而有對英不利之行動、渠不過謂終久或須採行較僅僅經濟利益所需要者、更爲有力之行動耳云、</p>
<p>英帝國總商會主席愛里邦克勳爵請外相向上院切實宣布、政府未有移交天津存銀及承認華北聯準鈔票之意、因首相在下院所發關於此事之言論不甚透澈也、愛里邦克動爵言及日本在華之軍事地位、謂日木貿易平衡之逆勢、日漸增甚、其金準備亦日形减少、而中國游擊戰爭亦阻止日本不能獲有鐵煤與棉之供給、日本在華北既遭敗績、而蘇聯之壓力聞亦迫令其撇兵至滿洲、觀於此種事實、絕無如英國堅持則日木將對英宣戰之可能、渠以爲終能控制激烈派者爲穩健派而日本尙不乏思想穩健之人、故一方面宜進行東京會議、一方面宜作與美國合作有所行動之準備、英國現宜採行更有力之行動、不久將有相持不下之偎局、屆時可進行調停以期結東戰事矣云、（三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>東京談判　依然停頓　日繼續反英示威</h3>
<p>（倫敦）路透社探悉、英政府接駐日英大使克萊琪關於英日談判進行之報告後、現尙未以共意見電克萊琪（三日路透）</p>
<p>（東京）本市商業區域之民衆二萬五千人、今日在英大使館門前舉行示威、持有「打倒英國」及共他標語之旗幟、代表五人以決議案而交英大使館之克寗漢氏、日木境內之共他城市亦有反英運動發生、同時日本各報對於英口談判之進展均抱悲觀、（叫日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國對遠東之願望</h3>
<p>英國之遠東政策，纔由彼首相張伯倫氏，於七月卅一日，在彼下議院宣述之後，越三日而至隔昨，又由彼外相哈里法克斯氏演說之於彼上議院；對象厥同，事出一揆，內容自相彷彿。本報於張伯倫氏所述，旣加評論；茲更就哈里法克斯氏所述而為本報前論所未及者，抉要申論之。</p>
<p>英外相演說中尤刺目者三端：一日英國政策之主要目標，乃為遠東急端覓取公允解決方案，對於關係各方之利益均予顧及，然後在較小範圍內，顧及英國本身利益；但其進行，務求無礙於中英兩國之關係，而欲求完成，實視中日兩國態度為轉移。二日英國在華各種陳舊的特權，非欲堅持，此有一九三一年與中國政府談判中國治外法權可為佐證；可見英國非欲墨守成規，非欲保全舊條約之整個機構。三日英國決不寬恕侵略，但日本基於地理位置與其經濟需要，在華自有權要求保有特殊利益與地位，並予以運用，此則英國完全準備予以承認。此三者，英國自來述及遠東政策之際，尤如一週前英首相之所宣述，輒作類似之透露，顧未嘗若此露骨，如隔昨英外相所言者也。</p>
<p>吾人首應明白體認者，上舉哈里法克斯氏所述之三端，乃為英國對於今後遠東所懷抱之願望，並非英國政府今日已在遠東推進之政策。自懷抱之願望以迄政策之推進，其時間空間俱有不可測量之距離，更自推進之發軔，以迄或成或敗之最後決定，則其間不僅有不可測量之距離存在而已，抑且有歧途焉，不知凡幾。是以吾人居於今日，殊不必因英外相陳其所願望而想入非非於彼願望推進中之問題如何，實現後之景象如何。顧有值得稱道之者，上述第一項，謂覓解決方案而稱公允也；公允有其必然之標準，非模稜之成語，非虛浮之濫調；况求其無碍於中英兩國之關係，是尤非公允不克求全；此可稱道。上述第二項，謂英國在華種種，必以完全獨立自主之中國政府為對手也；不稍遊移，不容假借，透剔堅定，正直賢明；雖曰事有誠然位置也，日本對中國，將何以異於英國對法國者乎？如何謂經濟需要也，將有以同於英國對印度者乎？如所謂保持特殊，將別有解釋於一般國際所謂優惠待遇之外，別有解釋於門戶開放機會均等之外者乎？諸如此類，解釋大可遊移，援引大可假借；顧英外相謂完全準備予以承認，是何容心哉？雖然，綜觀英外相演說之全文，絕不容斷章取義抉上述之第三項而曲解之；此則吾人所深信於彼之本意，僅以為不若是說則更善耳。</p>
<p>英國對遠東，其懷抱之願望如此；英國於經濟於海軍，擁有之力量如彼；以彼力量，伸此願望，則有二途。責日本以大義，曉日本以利害，循循善誘，使日本能承認英國願望，放棄侵略之作為，共謀公允之解決。是在中國方面，於主權領土行政之完整而外，原無他求；旣非遠東爭端之主動，不負遠東爭端之責任；總之，關鍵不在中國。此一途也，意者必為英國當局所最期望；惜乎日人方事排英，至少在今日尚為南轅北轍耳。英國與中國，有悠久之歷史，密切之利害，而於國際觀念與道德信仰尤多契合，兩國之淵源蓋遠矣；然英國在中國之所謂權益，迄今未足認為根深蒂固也；何也，英國必與中國相融洽，必得中國完全獨立自主之政府相提携，英國始克保持其權益，試證以今日英國在中國之華北如何，在長江流域如何，在粵南如何，洵乎有一皮之不存，毛將焉傅之關係者也。是以英國而謀實現其所願望，實際上其亦惟有盡其力量，與中國一德一心之一途而已。</p>

<h3>教部高教司科長陳東原談　如何選擇院系及學校（續五）</h3>
<p>選擇學校有兩個標準　學校本身與個人便利</p>
<p>學校標準</p>
<p>選擇學校、不能僅以學校招脾爲原則、第一節中、已有論列、因爲常人所推重的學校招牌、往往不足以代表學校的眞正優劣、更不足以說明合不合你的需要、然則如何選擇學校呢、我以爲有兩個標準、</p>
<p>（一）學校本身的標準、各個學校都有各個學校的優點、一好百好、是絕對沒有的、所以選擇學校、要看他是那幾種院系好、看的方法、無非在幾方面、一·設備、二·人材、三·學生在校風氣、四·畢業生在社會上的表現、一校之中、儘有這一院標準好那一院標凖不好的、本文開篇便說過、可惜現在還沒有一本專書、叙述全國大學各院系的情形、以供靑年升學的參考、但就我個人見聞所及、不妨略舉一二、例如文學院、以西南聯大中山大學浙江大學爲優、理學院以中央大學西南聯大燕京大學爲優、法學院以武漢大學·中央大學·東吳大學爲優、農學院以中央大學·私立金陵大學嶺南大學爲優、工學院以唐山工程學院·武漢大學·中央大學爲優、商學院以私立復旦大學·上海商學院爲優、醫學院以中央大學·同濟大學·西北聯合大學爲優、師範學院以國立師範學院·中央大學·浙江大學·西北聯合大學及中山大學爲優、　道管理、以國立交通大學爲優、凡此所舉、自不免掛一漏　不過聊以示例、詳細說來、各院中之各系、又因敎授人材之不同、而有優劣之互見、總之、諸位選擇學校、應當就各院系之設備、敎授人材、學生風氣、以及畢業生在社會上之貢獻各方面去觀察、才容易得到比較可靠的標準、</p>
<p>（二）個人便利的標準、前已言各個學校都有他的優點、我們選擇學校、遂不能專以學校本身之優劣爲標凖、那個學校對於個人便利與吾、也是一個重耍條件、例如、一·該校所在區域、是吾離家太遠、二·該校所需費用、是吾個人經濟能力擔負得了、三·該校對於個人、是吾有其他的關係、如父兄在該校做事、師友有自該校出身者之類、這都是値得考慮的問題、特別是目前交通困難、所入學校如離自己所在地太遠、考取之後、到校相當困難、便更要注意學校的所在區域了、本年度統一招生、報名時要塡三個志願、敎育部曾頒布考試及格經取錄之後、分發的原則四條、第一條云、「錄取新生、按其第一志願、不限考區、依照成績順序分發」依照這一條、諸位的第一志願、儘可塡經自己選定的理想的學校與院系、那末誰的考試成續好、誰可分發在自己所選的學校、完全靠成績競爭、廣東的考生、可以分發到陝西、重慶的考生、也可以分發到昆明、這也就是統一招生的用意所在、其第二條云、「錄取新生、第一志願之學校業已額滿時、按其第二第三志願之院系、分發考試區域或附近區之院校、仍以成續先後爲序、」按照這一條、諸位塡第二第三志願、注重在所填院系、須合個人選定的志願、至於所塡學校儘不妨就考試區或附近區內之學校塡寫、因爲將來事實上若未能照第一志願錄取、也只能分發在考試區或附近區的、此事因與報考時實際應用有關、故特附論之、　（完）</p>

<h3>恐怖份子　意軍釋出　查係「大道」僱員　常移交日軍當局</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、昨（三日）晨在極斯斐而路一〇八一號曹義小學大起紛擾之持械恐怖份子、昨日午後、由意軍當局移交日憲兵司令部而釋出後、立刻復返曹義小學、逐出教職員而盤踞該一度爲曹家渡保衛團團部之房屋、衆信此輩恐怖份子係汪派所組織之所謂、「中國國民黨劃共特務團」團員、聞若輩擬將該屋改成另一機關、恐怖份子於昨日午後經日憲兵司令部開釋後、其中的十人各執手溜彈與軍用盒子砲、惟已不執大刀、復返曹義小學、這令敎職員等立即退出、然後幣踞其內、偶有一二人巡　於屋外、已不遭意巡遜兵干涉矣、據官方消息稱、咋晨有恐怖份子十六人、被繳械而押往意軍司令部、嗣後移交日當局、因彼等爲「大道」僱員、而在日軍控制區內被捕故也云、</p>
<h3>準備滬戰紀念防務　捕房演習警報　未及一小時發兩次警報　探捕全體出動異常迅捷</h3>
<p>西區界外已加障碍物</p>
<p>字林報云、公共租界警務處各捕房、昨（三日）晚均準備行將到來的八八至八一三週年紀念日、午後五時四十五分、向各捕房分發實習警報、而捕房一致應召出發、但各隊於測騐召集後、甫返捕房、時爲六時四十分、總巡捕房發出總警報、下令搜覔汽車三輛、老閘捕房一隊三十人、馳赴浙江路橋、自蘇州河北岸而來之汽車、</p>
<p>均加搜查</p>
<p>旋獲車駕車者被帶入老閘捕房、被覊約二十分鐘、經向捕房說明渠非捕房加以搜覔者之一、乃經開釋、普陀路捕房巡邏隊、昨在勞勃生路一帶及附近巡邏、搜查行人、捕獲嫌疑犯的三十人、巡邏至午夜始畢、聞西區沿界外馬路一帶已</p>
<p>架障碍物</p>
<p>法租界巡捕、亦在海格路霞飛路轉角忙碌搜查行人、關於戒備辦法與動員計劃、昨夜未曾完全決定、兩租界各外國防軍軍官定今日（四日）舉行會議、擬定計劃、聞自八月八日至十六日、警務人員一概銷假、常時由後備隊保持之手提機關槍、已分發各捕房、以備對抗任何恐怖事件、</p>
<p>又大陸報云、公共租界警務處昨日午後五時聞外傳來自「歹土」之</p>
<p>暴徒若干</p>
<p>已越入公共租界、擬往愛多亞路報館集中地復施開槍暴行之謠詠、乃派後備隊巡捕赴靜安寺路一帶、對汽車。電車。與公共汽車、施以迅如疾雷之搜查、同時、巡捕在西區沿界外馬路一帶架障礙物、以防其他暴徒入公共租界、至咋日深夜、許多障礙物依然存、可表示將於滬戰爆發之八一三</p>
<p>兩週紀念</p>
<p>日以後、始行拆除、警務處迅速行動之結果、沿靜安寺路一帶交通受阻、搜查隊欄阻自西區駛來之每輛汽車、至爲嚴密、法租界警務當局與公共租界相合作、自午後五時左右起、在愛多亞路報館集中地一帶、開始廣泛之搜查行人與車輛、至十時後始畢、報館集中區盛傳</p>
<p>種種謠諑</p>
<p>或謂恐怖份子乘汽車九輛、自「歹土」出發、駛入市區、擬向報館行兇、此說是否事出有因、恐永不能知之、若有其事、諒係暴衆被突然採取之警務戒備所驚走矣、警務處承認公共租界內或有少數暴徒、故施搜查、聞此等暴徒中、有若干爲昨晨在極斯非而路與意兵幾起衝突之暴衆、</p>
<h3>英法兩郵輪　今日下午抵埠</h3>

<h3>山洪暴發　桂越路交通中斷　乘客須下車過駁再乘火車　海防貨物山積已暫停運輸</h3>
<p>河內同登　交通阻梗</p>
<p>據甫自海防返滬者談、河內與同登間之桂越鐵路交通、近來又被山洪沖斷、路基之被沖毀者、竟達十一公里之多、故旅客之經行該段者、必須分段乘船及乘人力車過駁、然後始能換乘火車、達到終點、因有上述梗阻、故行李亦加限制、每人祇准携帶三十公斤、交由鐵路局代運、又河內同登間、尙有公路可通現亦因洪水而停頓</p>
<p>海防存貨　又吿擁積</p>
<p>目下自滬港等處之運貨往內地者、當視海防爲唯一之轉口碼頭、因是之故、海防之進口貨物、乃時有擁擠不疏之現象、本年三四月間、曾有一度因貨物堆積過多、一時無法存納、乃限制貨物進口、嗣經極力疏通、增加車輛、建築倉庫、始見鬆動、茲據海防來函報吿、最近防地之倉庫、海關棧房、以及附近空地、均吿貨滿、無法再堆、更値雨季來臨、即有空地亦不能堆置貨物、時有整船貨物抵防後、以不能下卸、仍行運回啟運地之情形、故各運輸機關、一時均暫行停止收受運防貨物、</p>
<h3>某方以招工為名　誘騙工人赴靑　囚禁訓練迫赴某處作戰　兩工人逃滬述受騙經過</h3>
<p>大光社云、前據報載、某方嗾使無賴、秘密來滬、以招用工人起卸貨物爲名、實則均强制往靑島囚禁訓練云云、大光社記者昨晤適由靑島逃回之苦力工人、一名朱學昌、一名錢文昌、述被誘經過甚詳、據云、吾兩人原住於租界內西區草棚、前週遇有</p>
<p>素不相識</p>
<p>之某甲、謂吾等在滬做工、每日所得工資數角、不足維持生活、最好隨我（即某甲自稱）赴吳淞口外做海塘工、當時可得安家費二元、以後每日可得工資一元五角云云、吾兩人惑於利誘、乃於翌日晨由某甲率同多數</p>
<p>被招工人</p>
<p>及吾兩人、先由外灘乘駁船至浦東、繼由小輪運往吳淞口外、當即迫登某方運輸船、而被驅入甲板下之一隅、待至三日、該船的載有一千餘名華人、逕駛靑島、在一不知名稱碼頭登陸、而被押解至沿海邊各棧內、每日訓練、動輒毆打、</p>
<p>苦難盡述</p>
<p>該棧門均裝有鐵欄、監視甚嚴、極盡壓迫能事、吾等經被誘訓練、工人密吿、謂三個月後即實行運往作戰、陸續開往者、爲數甚巨、吾等聞言、</p>
<p>不寒而慄</p>
<p>乃佯為患病、而於隔離時、乘間得鑽出笆牆、逃往某外船求救、經由西人准許、方將余二人密帶回滬云云、不勝欷歔、又據探悉、關於上述情事、運日租界方面仍多活動招工誘騙、希望各界轉吿工人、勿再入彀、</p>

<h3>侵佔區英籍敎士　已遭重大壓迫　內地敎士多在威脅下退出　中國人民槪不同情於反英</h3>
<p>字林報云、中國所有被侵佔區中、日方發動之反英運動猖獗、其注意力今已轉向英籍敎士、彼等現常受日當局之壓迫、已往數週中、上海已數接英籍敎士被遂出其房產及遭虐待之消息、但迄今爲止、因郵務失常、交通阻梗、描述被佔區內眞相之可靠消息不多、咋（三日）據中國內地敎會與英國浸禮敎會人員語記者稱、關於敎會區中最近反英行動、彼等所得消息雖無多、但已確知內地敎士已在威脅下退出房產、而侵佔區中驅逐央敎士之其他運動正熾、中國</p>
<p>內地敎會房產受此運動之影響者、有山西之臨汾與洪洞、該兩地英人均已撤退、河南開封之英人亦已退出、房產旋被當地警察當局查封、開封日方此舉結果、敎會醫院中之百餘病人被迫離院、病人中頗多甫施手術而狀况甚危者、相信未曾覔得其他安身處、以容此輩病人、英國浸禮敎會之英人</p>
<p>在恫嚇下撤退者、有太原。新州。代州（譯音）、退出之敎士、大多已往北戴河、今尙未得確報、但信產業無損壞、據臨汾消息、該地敎會房產遭得資喬裝華人之韓人與「滿人」所破壞、但上海米得破壞程度之消息、開封與洪洞之產業、諒無損壞、中國內地敎會某員會稱華人對日人之反英運動</p>
<p>均表冷淡上海接訊、已證明係日人本身得轉人「滿人」與常地少數無賴華人之助而實行一切煽動、聞山西長治區有相類之反英運動、該地有醬院一所、今亟欲接得該地之若干消息、另一批被日軍遂出之敎土、因洪水而阻於石家莊、不知彼等係是吾屬於中國內地敎會、該員復述及中國人民並不同情於反英運動、謂洪洞於鼓噪後、當地</p>
<p>華人代表團曾向敎會道歉、並駁斥日方所傳當地對英人有一般的惡感之說、英人旣不准入開封、亦不得留居其中、中國內地敎會乃派美籍人員兩名前往開封、照料產業、兩人可望負責賡續工作、允其爲翳院服務、山西英人雖受嚴酷待遇、然該省南部仍有少數敎士、彼等是吾受重大壓迫、猶未可知、某員相信反英鼓噪僅</p>
<p>限於日方　控制甚力之大城中、他處華人對英人、和陸如常、開封英人因得離境之期限、乃退出房產、敎會院中曾有暴衆二三十人作示威運動、由日人給資二三角、敎士靴欲留居該地、從事醫藥工作、以救危殆之數病人、但迫不得已而退離云、</p>
<h3>西安蘭州廣西三地　恢復個人小包</h3>
<p>上海至西安·蘭州·廣西省等地之大小郵包、因交通梗塞、運輸不便、致暫吿停止、嗣經上海郵政管理局運輸股數度設法、恢復以上各地大小包裹、茲除大宗商品包裹仍暫停收寄外、個人小包及藥品小包業已恢復收寄、惟須眞正個人包裹、商品不得混充、每件以二公斤爲限、應收資費詳細規定、</p>
<h3>日方砲轟浦東　足證華軍活躍　傳華軍攻川沙南滙日軍　日艦開砲歷一小時始畢</h3>
<p>昨晨三時許、滬東方面、突有隆降之排砲聲、租界上隱的可聞、在楊樹浦及平凉路一帶、允爲淸晰、居民咸從睡夢中驚醒、恐怖萬狀、認爲游擊隊進襲滬市、直至黎明四時左右、砲聲始漸吿沉寂、事後經調查所得、該項砲聲、係發自停泊於吳淞口浦面之日艦、聞因日軍鑒於滬市四郊游擊隊之日形活躍，允以浦東。南滙。川沙等地之時遭華方襲擊、故於昨晨由日艦施放排砲、向浦東方面轟擊、企圖威脅活躍於浦東等地之游擊隊、且邇來日艦每於深夜不時放射探照燈、向浦東及閘北上空探照、山於日軍戒備之驟形嚴密、可見滬郊之游擊隊確屬相當活躍、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（一二日）晨三時至四時三十分、有人聞日艦在吳淞附近猛擊浦東、此可證實華方所傳游擊隊猛攻川沙與南滙兩區日駐軍之說、聞南滙城垣外華方流動部隊極度活躍、派小隊伍赴城郊以誘日軍、而大隊則伏擊往攻之日軍、</p>
<h3>經平準會維持後　全國外匯穩定　對必需品輸入儘量供給外滙　淪陷區域黑市外滙消滅困難</h3>
<p>外滙平準基金管理委員會、以全力維持後、全國外滙、始終穩定、法定價格、並無變動、必需品之輸入、儘量供給、國際貿易經調整後、外滙基金、益臻充實、惟黑市外滙、消滅困難、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>經維持後　外匯穩定</p>
<p>自英商滙豐·麥加利。以及中國交通四銀行一千萬英鎊借款成功、設立平準外滙基金管理委員會後、竭力維持外滙法定價格、全國各地、除淪陷區域外、外滙價格、始終穩定、（一）英滙一先令二便士半、（二）美滙三十美元、（三）法滙一千零八十法郞、（四）德滙七十五馬克、（五）港滙九十五港元、關於淪陷區域上海·天津·等處、有所謂外滙黑市塲、其外滙價格與法定相差頗遠、比較低落四分之三、</p>
<p>必需之品　儘量供給</p>
<p>凡進口商經營之進口物品、不在禁止輸入之列、而爲國內所必需者、均得向外滙審核委員會申請購買外滙、指定中國交通兩銀行辦理之、但申請人須繳納按法價與中交兩行掛牌價格差額之平衡費、惟進口貨由淪陷海關輸人者、則不得享受申請法定外滙、所以上海方面、並無外滙審核委員會之設立、中國·交通·兩行、亦無掛牌行市、中央銀行、僅全日公佈法定外滙價行市而已、</p>
<p>黑市外匯　消滅困難</p>
<p>所謂上海之黑市外滙、在政府權力所不及、取締困難、被刦奪後之江海關、又無法實施禁止進口貨品辦法、及土貨出口結滙領取差額辦法、所以奢侈品以及非必需品、仍得由江海關等進口、是項貨物之購買外滙、不得不仰求於上海外滙黑市、故欲消減黑市塲之外滙、事實上有困難之處、惟爲防止應禁之貨混入內地起見、已實行禁止轉口及郵寄至非淪陷區域、</p>
<p>調整貿易　充實外匯</p>
<p>國際貿易經調整後、主要土貨如茶葉·桐油·猪鬃。礦產等、輸出激增、並結售外滙與政府、而非必需品之進口、已由政府命令禁止、所以中國之外滙基金、益見充實、此外華僑滙款、戰後激增、以及（一）各國對華文化事業費、（二）外國船隻停泊及修理費用、（三）外國軍艦及駐華費用、（四）各國在華使館費用、（五）外人在華遊歷費用、均爲中國無形之收入、可以抵償貿易之入超之一部份、</p>
<p>黑市緊縮　有益中國</p>
<p>上海法幣暗市、價値跌落、實爲奸人套買作祟、但與中國法幣政策、無大影響、而於中國金融之國際信用、允無絲毫損失、且從國際貿易立足點觀之、有利於中國、外幣價漲、進口貨物價增、首蒙其害者、厥爲外國商人、而中國反可以造成國民之節的、與入超之减少、所以中國政府對於上海外滙黑市、實無需要維持之理由、故聞此後平準外滙委員會、對上海黑市外滙、決聽其自然、</p>
<p>取締投機　安定社會</p>
<p>黑市外滙波動之主力、（一）爲滙票市塲、（二）爲外幣紙幣市塲、（三）爲金市、滙票市塲之維持、以銀行爲主、外幣紙幣買賣市塲以錢兌業之錢莊爲主、金市則以錢莊與銀樓爲主、今中外金融當局將予嚴密審核買賣之種類、以避免套取投機之弊、如限制供給黑市外滙、停止外滙掉期等、而免滙市波動太巨、引起市塲紊亂與社會民衆生活之不安、</p>
<p>兆豐公園特別音樂</p>
<p>工部局音樂隊定於本（五）日晚九時至十一時（如天氣良好）、在兆豐公園舉行特別音樂會、屆時將由奧國中决音歌唱名家克拉沙參加歌唱名曲、節目計有六項、</p>
<h3>日軍肆擾沿海　並無重要價値　浙省府主席黃紹竑氏報吿　斷定日已無力擴張佔領區</h3>
<p>新聲社云、浙省府主席黃紹雄氏、近在黨政機關聯合紀念週報吿浙省最近情况與今後應付方針、略謂、日人在浙省沿海各地騷擾、爲日人整個政策、不是局部行動、定海玉環各縣一部份地方的被佔、在軍事上看、無重大價値、目的在騷擾、關於整個戰局者、黃氏斷定日人再沒有力量擴張佔領區域、今後應付方針、（一）加强政治力量、以保障軍事的勝利、努力安定社會、培養地方力量、以便持久作戰、（二）力求自力更生、打破封鎖計劃、甲·加强國際的認識、剷除依賴心理、乙。力求自給自足、不仰賴外力、（三）實行政治緊縮、節省糜費、甲。對外來東西竭力節省、汽油煤油加以管理、乙·硏究替代品、可以替代的都想法替代、丙·改良技術、加緊生產、（四）另闢稅源、建立財政新基礎、將各種事業實行公營公賣專賣、</p>

<h3>値行研究之火險問題　申新廠控三保險公司　是否戰時狀態為爭執焦點</h3>
<p>申新紡微總公司法定代理人榮溥仁、近延陸聰祖·何百謙·兩律師、具狀在第一特區法院民庭、控訴江西路太平保險公司法定代理人丁雪農、四川路中國保險公司法定代理人過福雲、北京路中國天一保險公司法定代理人王仁全等、賠償火險損失一案、其起訴意旨略稱、原吿公司在本市楊樹浦路四六八號設有巾新第七廠、附置貨棧、其建築爲四層樓之洋式堆棧、內儲棉花與棉布、由被吿保險公司等承擔</p>
<p>火災保險</p>
<p>該堆棧上下以數字分八個棧房、其中僅第三號及第五號棧房因火災而受損失、其第三號棧房計太平共保九十萬兀、中國共保四十寓元、第五號棧房貨物計太平共保三十二萬元、中國天一共保五萬元、此次火災係於民國二十六年十二月十日、在原告貨棧內發生、對於該第三號及第五號棧房之貨物、損害甚重、乃由原吿向各被吿提出要求、倘對提出之損失淸單、未能同意、則　依照保險契約第十八條之規定、</p>
<p>交付公斷</p>
<p>迨至去年八月廿二日、被吿等仍拒絕選定公斷人、被吿等之態度、實足阻礙原吿之進行、蓋契的條文、旣曾規定非先公斷、不得起訴、自非先付公斷不可、乃由原吿之法律顧問代表、選定李會計師爲獨任公斷人、經過審愼調查之下、判斷結果、火災損失之數目、然第三號棧房計國幣三十二萬九千七百三十六元二角、第五號棧房計國幣十九萬一千三百叫十四元六角五分、原吿根據判斷結果、委托上海黃浦灘路十二號裴格氏對上述</p>
<p>損失數目</p>
<p>計算各被吿公司及外國保險公司等、在每張保險契的下應受攤派額數、今年四月十四日、裴格氏以其計算結數、函復原吿之法律顧問、依其計算、第一被吿太平保險公司應負責給付國幣三十五萬六千九百八十二元五角、第二被吿中國保險公司應負責給付國幣九萬一千二百七十三元一角三分、第三被吿中國天一保險公司應負責給付國幣二萬零九百八十五元四角二分、共合成國幣四十六萬九千二百四十一元零五分、原吿曾以此</p>
<p>攤派計算</p>
<p>向被吿等要求、照數給付、而遭拒絕、爲此提起訴訟、請依法判令賠償、幷負擔訟費、本件判決幷請宣示假執行云云、而被吿太平·中國·天一·等各保險公司、自接奉傳票後、亦分延鄂森劉世芳等律師提出答辯、謂本件原吿向辯訴人等訴請賠償、係根據兩造所訂之火災保殮契的、但查該契約第六條規定、凡在非常情形、存在期內所發生之損失、保險人不負賠償責任、但如被保險人就其損害之原因、能證明與</p>
<p>非常情形</p>
<p>之存在絕無關係者、保險人始負賠償責任、而同條末項又訂明在此塲合舉證責任、應山被保險人負擔、本件保險標的物之所在地、爲公共租界東區內、楊樹浦路第四六八號堆棧內之棉花棉布、而火災發生於二十六年十二月十日淸晨、該地自八一三後、爲日軍作戰之根據地、即至今日、尙在佔領圍困狀態之下、此乃顯著之事實，今原吿不能證明、對辯訴人等根本上無賠償之義務、原吿誤解、</p>
<p>保險契約</p>
<p>第十條之意義公斷、復依不合法公斷所得數額，請求賠償、殊無理由、應請駁回云云、昨午後此案由徐福基推事升座審理、原吿代理陸聰祖·何百謙·律師除陳述起訴理由外、幷聲明查我國國軍係於二十六年十月二十七日退出　北、十一月十一二號退出南市浦東一帶、而申新堆棧係於十二月十號上午八時發生火災、是距離國軍撒退已相隔四十餘天、該處已無戰事狀態、至此次</p>
<p>起火原因</p>
<p>原吿方面當然不知、但絕對幷非燬於砲火或飛機之炸彈、且內中尙有最要之一點、即太平保險公司之五萬元保險單一紙、係甫於二十六年十一月二十六日出立、離火災祇十餘天、旣經出立保單、應負賠償責任、幷提出工部局公報、及救火會之報告、證明火災爲十一月十號之上午、但被吿方面之律師鄂森·劉世芳等、仍以非常情形爲抗辯之理由、徐推事諭本案改期再核、</p>
<p>司機過失殺人</p>
<p>公共汽車公司駕駛員阜寗人王金才、上月二十八日上午九時許駕駛一五〇四二號公共汽車、山東向西、行經新閘路近溫州路地方、因煞車失去效用、撞死路人華祥生、經捕房偵查結果、依過失殺人罪起訴、昨晨由蕭培身推事蒞庭訊結、論令被吿交一千元出外、聽候宣判、</p>
<h3>馬如祺被捕　經營救後釋出　日方輕信女巫之言濫施逮捕　據稱與永源老闆被害案有關</h3>
<p>滬西極司非而路康腦脫路口安樂坊六號水源賭窟老闆、川沙人張阿毛（又名康梅年三十一歲）、於上月二十八日下午八時四十分、在靜安寺路地豐路口、被人開槍擊斃、兇手在逃、詳情曾誌本報、詛至前日（三日）下午七時許、有住居法租界貝勒路五九八弄三十一號之本地商人馬如祺者、正在滬西曹家渡忻康里大生俱樂部、與友人</p>
<p>談話之際</p>
<p>突來自稱娛樂塲監督處之日人一名、聲稱張康梅暗殺一案、現有人告發、謂馬涉有重大嫌疑、特來拘捕等語、當時即有人向其解釋、竟遭該日人威脅、馬當時無奈、祇得隨該日人同去、馬之親友聞訊、多方設法奔走、直至昨日上午始告釋出、惟事後經人調查一、馬之</p>
<p>被捕原因</p>
<p>據稱有女巫（俗稱仙人）一人、性好賭博、爲永源賭窟顧客之一、前日（二日）該女巫叉至永源豪賭、詎賭興正濃之際、該女巫忽變常態、並自稱謂有寃鬼附身、而該寃鬼即係被人槍殺之張康梅、大呼兇手乃係小王、（按小王係張康梅合創、永源賭窟者、現已在逃）、更稱在張被殺之前一日、事先小王曾在馬如祺家中、</p>
<p>與馬密謀</p>
<p>等語、其時張之家屬在旁、聞悉斯語、竟輕信上項鬼話而密報日方、而日方亦即以女巫之言爲證據、將馬逮捕、斯誠本埠濫行捕人聲中之趣聞、且與昔日厲王利用巫人爲監謗恣意殘設人民、有異曲同工之妙、</p>
<p>又據華聞社云、前日（三號）傍晚五時、滬西曹家渡忻康里大生賭窟搖攤　上店永芳之攤方畢、由馬士乾</p>
<p>接擋之際</p>

<h3>紗花　華日廠紛起採辦　棉花交易開展　棉商所定路貨掃數售罄</h3>
<p>中外棉花交易、俱見起色、華日廠皆有納胃、因之市勢向榮、此項棉花、都係同業中昔日購訂之貨、業已接得國外電訊、粗細棉花已裝載輪船向遠東而來、不久當可抵滬、棉商免得貨到地頭籌款交解、乘廠方活動之際、照市合價遷就一步、掃數售罄、較洋行定價要廉宜殊巨、至於廠方亦樂得塌便宜貨、於是路貨生意、大爲活躍、本日成交總計四千五百件、華廠進一千八百五十件、日廠進二百件、其餘均同業成交據云轉輾大都仍以售予外廠也、蘇北來源、計通州花五十五包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來銀根較鬆、日廠存底單薄、並同業手貨之售價、與洋行方而之訂價、尙廉二十餘元、因之日廠猛力吸購、故各同業之存棉幾將罄盡、因存棉日减、售價日漲、將於洋行方面之售價相等、</p>
<p>印棉連續而來、茲悉今日到滬之大英公司正班船Carthage號、自倫敦來滬、經孟買時裝來棉花四百五十七件、的下午五時進口停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、叉該公司經理之鴨家公司加拿吉打班輪Shirala號、此次山喀爾喀搭運來棉花二千九百件、的明日（六日）下午四時可到滬亦停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市開盤時、價格不振、因利物浦及孟買來雷吿跌、下落五至八磅　、投機者以美棉出口津貼業已公佈、因而獲利了結者多、同時引起各方之套賣、棉區氣候報吿日趨佳境、接照私人估計、本年產棉額的在一千一百五十萬包左右、後市上有新戶購買、市價略漲、結果較之十日收盤好起一二磅音、印度運同預測漲半羅比餘、埃及漲七八磅音、</p>
<h3>大宗日紗布來華傾銷　紗市震盪不寗</h3>
<p>紗市價趨下游、異常疲弱、同時客銷益覺淡泊、實緣連朝辦去之貨、爲額殊巨、納胃暫有飽滿之象、或有一度休憇、等待消化後再當採辦、至於同業之互相買賣、亦不及昔日之擁擠、而做手亦緩和、市况已瑧平坦之境、但有一部份仍以廠方無意開紗、加之原棉昂貴、依然傾向於多頭地位也、</p>
<p>現紗晨初同業大都觀望、客幫亦不來買紗、流動掮客在市兜貨賣出委託爲夥、又聞日紗開盤下跌十元、呌喊賣聲特盛、開價一跌五元之譜、二十支雙馬外棧貨價爲五百八十三元、棧單價爲五百七十元、此時形勢平庸、少頃聞黃金稍昂、買氣轉濃、復升三四元、二十支雙馬現貨價爲五百八十七元、棧單價爲五百七十三元、往後成交並不十分暢達、迨至收盤回小二三元不等、總之紗市仍在徘徊之境、查半日成交統計九百七十包、又上日午後成交二百五十包、行情二十支雙馬跌三元、收市跌三元、五子跌五元、今日有棉紗一百十件運暹邏、又二百二十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左</p>
<p>日紗市面大上大落、開盤以報載日本有大宗棉紗棉布運往華北華中銷售之說、於是人心震盪驚愕、二十支月琴本月份出貨價忽跌十元、爲四百五十元、旋以獲利者搜補、又復回升至四百五十六元至八元、收盤比上日價僅小二元、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價稍平</h3>
<p>杜米　咋到松江帮小輪拖來八儎、　涇到車輪包子南帮貨一千六七百包、人心轉懈、市塲淸淡異常、塲外交易亦少、故厚粳等塲外價格、已小半元之譜、開二十三元左右、高客尖開十八元半至十八元、至塲內交易、無論粳尖高宿兩檔、仍無出樣、祇做開　十六元、糙尖十五元、及變元二十二元、依眼光而論、亦落三四角、統計市內外成數的有四千餘包、總之、市面雖屬混沌、然一般人心、未免稍有顧忌、故形勢一懈、即皆觀望、若今日仍見呆滯、則其下瀉之勢必銳、當不亞於上漲時也、</p>
<p>客秈　昨晨一度緊張後、客風趁高售出、獲利浮囤、尤多求脫、市面立鬆、雖產地開禁尙無確訊、而人心已稍回平、明暗二盤售價均低一二角、但十六元限盤以內者仍屬　糙各糙、機秈仍相差一二三元不等云、</p>
<p>洋米　昨日仍在擯持中</p>
<p>貨方喊價曾提高一元以上、而進口需要雖貪、終嫌價昂、未能成交，</p>
<h3>麺粉暴漲　本街現鈔五元二角　客帮匯劃六元二角</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨現粉復漲、廠方意甚堅決、故上午本街批價已改爲五元一角現鈔、比前見升一角、聞後市父漲一角、而客帮繼續要求滙劃開價、廠方亦允改售六元二角之滙劃、故昨起本客價格又有現鈔與滙劃之別，統市成交各牌粉併計五萬餘包、除本街及內地帮零銷的計一萬餘包外、其餘悉由客帮辦去、</p>
<p>小麥　咋小麥來源絡繹、而銷路亦活潑、蓋福新與阜豐兩廠、續有添辦、本街囤戶去路亦屬不衰、且粉價猛漲、所以執貨者均有扳　之意、市面又漲一二角、統市售開崑山·無錫·丹陽·南京·戚墅堰·蘇州·奔牛等麥共二十車、價爲七元零五分至六元七角、除福新阜豐兩廠合辦十三車外、條均本街辦去、</p>
<h3>油餅　油價猛昇　大連開禁未實現　豆油暴漲一元九</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市况、又起風波、蓋所傳大連八月份開禁之說、又成泡影、故人心激昂、投機活躍、且今日有長江倫位、交易更見突增、一日間連油暴騰一元八九角、惟簍裝油來源不絕、市尙平穩、昨祇升三四角、統計成交大連桶油一百五十桶、價自四十六元步提至叫十七元一角、神戶來連油四百桶、價自四十六元五角升至四十七元八角、靑島桶油五十桶、四—五元八角、天津聽裝油四百聽、四十四元至四十四元六角、膠州簍裝油三百件、三十四元、靑歧油二百五十件、三十叫元四角、烟歧油三百件、三十四元八角、</p>
<p>五日有豆子八十包運香港、四日桐油二千聽自天津運來、</p>
<h3>糖市　國糖疲軟</h3>
<p>昨糖市據外電、嗬囒九月份略降、爲六盾半、倫敦微升，十二月份六先令〇二五、明年三月份六先令一辦士、六月份六先令一辦半、本市公會劃盤、二四粗白、現貨及轉口貨均乏上落、太古車白續有降落、東棧B嘜三十七元、西棧三十七元半、小三角、CW嘜三十七元三角小一角、CX嘜不動、爲三十七元、DY嘜三十六元半，HX嘜三十六元三角、均小三角、荷赤現貨小三角、爲二十八元三角、轉口小一角、爲二十一元七角、本綿白及本冰均持原價國糖因近日去化見稀、而八一三期近、故行方無意貪進、致未成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新漳枝登塲</h3>
<p>漳州產蘭竹枝鳥葉枝、首批貨已於前日運申、共計四百餘箱、收成尙佳、惟漳州至鼓浪嶼之交通、因某方時有阻碍、極形不便、偶一不愼、有被沒收之危險、故業此者不無顧忌、是以來源似難過旺、但新粵枝因原到不能出口、漳枝旣可運申、頗估優勢云、</p>
<h3>蘭竹枝售八十元</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝首批抵申後、聞號貨已有開出、行方以成本高昂、故不求厚利、咋揀蘭竹枝售八十元、其餘早紅鳥叶照退、</p>
<h3>五金　元絲本釘俱昂</h3>
<p>連日本釘交易甚熱鬧、天津帮大量吸收、本街建築帮及囤戶進胃亦健、致廠方出貨不够分配、日來元絲及盤元（均爲本釘原料）價漲四五元、刻市盤兀售二十六元、元絲沽十七元、因之本釘倍司亦被帶高、售盤每桶二十七元、僅比其原料（盤元高出一元、故某廠家有停頓之勢、人心挺秀、</p>
<h3>台槴涨八九元</h3>
<p>台梔子除供應藥材外、兼可作一切飲料色素、故銷路頗佳、詛汕頭及晋江交通相繼堵塞、致來源斷絕、查本市存積亦復有限、昨日有本街辦去十餘件、售價比前漲起八九元、</p>
<h3>山奈将近成盤</h3>
<p>山柰來源旣絕、底存漸缺、近以貼現關係、人心益堅、故號方扳緊未售、聞日來行家進意頗濃、雙方在接談中、刻高呌四十元、即日可望成盤、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球廠需要鴻基屑</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤屑、來源不湧、各煤球廠消化反旺、致市貨供不敷求、允以一般小廠間接定貨、更屬恐慌、故暗盤頗見俏俐、鴻基頭號屑每噸已喊四十五元、二號屑三十八元、洋涇浜碼頭排車、送到另加行槓、</p>
<h3>統計　邁進中之生活指數　食住上漲無止境</h3>
<p>工部局公報載二十八年七月上海市工人生活費指數云本年以還，物價激增，生活費指數猛進不已，七月份指數達一八八·五六，較上月又升一二·四一點，計增百分之七·〇五，以較去歲同月及基年（二十五年）指數，則各高白分之二〇·九八及八八·五六，生活費高漲，貨幣購買力隨之而降低，二十五年度法幣一元，迄今恰當五角三分〇三毫。</p>
<p>分類指數，亦趨上升，食物類指數較上月增百分之九·五六，燃料增五·五八，雜項增〇·四六，衣着大致平穩，略降百分之〇·〇七，房租則較本年上半年度增百分之四·六七。（未完）</p>

<h3>雜談文藝創作</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>誠如白櫻先生所說，一年來的出版界，譯文凌駕一般創作而上，而造成了「景氣」的現象。他所列舉的譯作，自然不以文藝作品爲限，無論屬於經濟的，法律的，社會的，以至類於傳記或游記等譯作，統統包括在內。</p>
<p>這種現象的呈示，一方面固然値得欣喜，以別人的文化食糧來療我們的飢荒，不單目前萬分需要，將來也未始不可資爲考鏡；但從另一方面說，自己的創作貧乏到如此，就未免太覺可憐了。</p>
<p>所以造成譯作「景氣」的因素，一言以蔽之，是環境的惡劣與困難，阻礙了創作：創作者雖然有了亟好的材料，在章璧未曾排除的今日，寫作也許暫時不感到麻煩，而出版就要發生問題。列如「七七」變前，許多前進昨家，爲了和當時的國策背馳，往往「緘口結舌一，不能够把活生生的現實來表達於筆端；自從茅盾的「子夜」遭受芟薙以後，譯作何嘗不捲起高潮？「死靈魂」，「密爾格拉得」「燎原」等等，都是那一時期的產品。現在特殊區域的環境，其困難十倍於昔，創作者除了把材料「什襲珍藏」，便沒有別種更好的方法；創作的沈寂而無生氣，其故在此</p>
<p>然而話雖如此說，創作在中國文壇，祇以文藝而言，向來就非常可憐，如魯迅的「阿Q正傳」，茅盾的「子夜」等，能够充分表現强烈的社會意識，而成爲有血有肉的傑作的，實在屈指可計。原因在於那里呢？以我個人的感覺，作家對現實的認識，似乎過於輕視，或竟單憑主觀，一味「閉門造車，致內容落於空虛，縱使寫作技術高達頂點，充其量，也不過做到「爲藝術而藝術」的一步，把文藝弄成了裝飾品；甚至將無名作家一脚踢出，編輯者和出版者結成了鐵一般的封鎖綫，使有志創作的無名作家感到望門興歎，終於知難而退。因之，從「五四」以來，這遙遙二十餘年中，我們極少讀到偉大的文藝作品，有之，僅「阿Q正傳」和「子夜」寥寥幾部而已。這種莫可補救的損失，祇有讓歷史來負其責任。</p>
<p>其决，白櫻先生提出的材料處理與題材組織問題，也値得重視的；有了好材料而缺乏處理的方法，或有了好題材而沒有組織的技巧，都不能產生成功的作品。如賽珍珠的「愛國者」，中國的文藝作家自然能寫，而且更不息缺少這類的材料；但有些作家的毛病，却不是不善處理，而在於以耳代目，一個科學家的成功，以實騐爲基本條件文藝創作者能够寫成有血有肉的作品，我以爲處理材料以外，還應該從現實中蒐集材料，不讓絲毫的理想成分滲入作品；而爲作態度，我們總要以不歪曲現實爲主要條件。</p>
<p>兩年來可供寫作的材料太多了，等到將來障壁排除之後，希望有劃時代的作品產生出來。</p>
<h3>交通壕中</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>——勞軍散記</p>
<p>盛夏天，强烈的太陽光在四野裏燃燒；宇宙沈默着，窒悶着，沒有一點聲息。柳條，荊棘，靑草，紫籐，都乾縐得低低地下垂着。</p>
<p>在草原上，我們肩負着纍纍的慰勞品，向前行進。過躍龍浜，灣進那曲折的交通壕，步子更加快了，汗珠滴上那燥而熱的壕底，現出點點的濕痕。</p>
<p>眺望草原外，揚起着淡灰色的輕烟。我們一面走，一面吹着「祖國進行曲」的調子，和動盪於空際的槍聲遙遙相應。</p>
<p>「沙……沙沙沙……沙……」突然的一陣響聲，掠頂而過。接着，距離我們不到二十碼的後面，就落下一顆砲彈，泥土飛上雲際，一道急遽上昇的濃烟，凝聚在高空中。</p>
<p>誰也不去留意那個砲彈爆裂，儘自划開步子前進。</p>
<p>灣過一片田，不遠的前面叉落下一顆砲彈，毀壞了壕面，泥土崩倒下去，流溢着火藥的臭味。</p>
<p>「這倒有些像一隻橫着的大黑熊在嘆氣。」一個同志打趣地笑起來。</p>
<p>「動手，動手，自己動手……」大家都喊了起來。但當我們跑過去凖備動手時，中彈的地方已經發現了四個工兵，揮動泥鍫，在鋤開壕中的泥堆。我們驚奇地走近去，和他們握握手，送給他們一串香蕉，又繼續行進。</p>
<p>走了一些路，回頭一望，壕面已恢復了原狀，那四個工兵也突然不見了。</p>
<p>一個善談的同志，就打開了話匣子：在前綫就要行動敏捷，態度沉着，堅毅，鎭定。他們有浪費子彈的本能，我們却有隨時修整的功夫。距離我們相近的砲彈沒有用，遠的會濟事嗎？損不到什麼…。」</p>
<p>他的話又被另一聲「碰通」的巨響打斷了。他望着前面，張開嘴，嘻喀地笑着說：「又來了，我們儘管走我們的，讓它去罷。」</p>
<p>走着，說着，笑着，嘴唇又吹出「血洗河山」的調子。週遭的砲彈爆裂，前面的隱的吶喊，飛機的馬達旋鳴，這些聲音，愈來愈密了。太陽，熱浪，汗流，口渴，似都飛出了我們的感覺以外，那槍聲，那砲彈，那濃烟，那污泥上淌着戰士的血水，在閃耀地引誘着。</p>
<p>「前面就是第二道防綫的戰壕，再過去，可就到最前綫了。也許會有機會給我們幹一下吧？」李隊長揚起手這樣說。</p>
<p>砲雖響得緊密，第二道防綫的戰壕中還是靜靜的，安閑的；一排一排的戰士沉默地伏臥着，把住槍柄，只有從前面烟慕　沒中傳過來，那像海浪翻騰，像火山爆裂的聲音，驅逐了空間的寂寞。</p>
<p>我們灣出交通壕口，就有一位營長帶幾位弟兄跑來，和藏地，謙恭地，代我們解下慰勞品的包袱，代我們屑負着，輕鬆地，迅速地，一同蹓進第二道防綫的戰壕。</p>

<p>批評別人，指摘別人的給別人一個耳刮子；但，一轉身偏又打在自己的嘴巴上，熱辣辣地，眞是可憐又復可笑。人們常遺失了那面照自己心靈的鏡子，這又未免可悲。</p>

<h3>談化裝</h3>
<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>自己會演過一决話劇，深知化裝之苦，允其在夏天，滿面脂粉，比重裘裹體更吃不消。可是我並不反對女人化裝。至少因爲她們化裝，受罪也祇是她們自己的事，與我毫不相干。上舞台演戲，不能不化裝；若反證莎士比亞之說，人生即是演戲，那末日常生活之化裝，自然也就無足爲奇的了。</p>
<p>化者變也，裝者飾也。穿衣服帶帽子，其實也都是化裝。在舞合上演什麼角色，便依照這角色的性質來化裝；在人間，做一個書生，也就有書生的裝束。藝術家故意把頭髪留得很長，何嘗是沒有功夫，也何嘗是沒有留心到，只不過是要適合他的職業，加以化裝罷了。</p>
<p>在劇院里看脚色在台上演戲，很少能不被化裝的效果所騙的。人的面孔一經渲染，自然變化無窮，出神入化的了。可是普天之下，又有幾人能看透化裝的外表，而深入內心靈府的呢？何况人類聰明日進，不但面孔會化裝，甚至連靈魂精神都能化裝。粉墨之後，儘你眼睛多尖，也只有被騙。化裝術的進步，也是與日俱進；簡直不但與日俱進，還竟狂飈突進了。</p>
<p>天下之人，心越黑，其面就越白。這是一定的道理。皮膚粗糙，所以要搽用大量的潤膚膏；頭髮白了，要充年輕，所以要染黑。沒有黑髮還要染黑，黃皮膚再搽黃粉的道理。賣國賊的言論也會化裝得光明堂皇，騙子也從來沒有顯着騙子的面具的。平時衆矢之的的壞蛋，其實遠不及別人以爲好人者來得壞。化裝手段越高妙，其奸猾程度也就越深，此乃天下定理，可惜人多被惑耳。</p>
<p>歐洲有一著名乞丐，穿得襤褸不堪，身上叉是滿生爛瘡，年紀衰老，形狀極爲可憐，白日踞坐人行道畔，哀聲求乞，行人大多隨手拋下一文二文，可是一到晚上，這乞丐却住在大厦裏，起居闊綽，衣飾華麗，年紀實在不老，身上也沒有斕瘡；不過是靠化裝之術，求乞騙錢而已。</p>
<p>這類事到處有之，不但騙錢，還有驟名，騙權，騙信仰，以至於騙國家願羣衆，也都在態度，心理，面目，行爲，語言，各方面的化裝之下，一一施行於人間。</p>
<p>如此看來，眞有誰能不化裝的道理？</p>
<p>炎暑中，女人的面孔上該覺得不舒服了。我不反對脂粉的應用。人格人品都被紅紅白白的脂粉裹住了，區區面皮，又何足道哉！</p>

<h3>原野觀感</h3>
<p>— 李仁</p>
<p>中法劇社在「阿Q正傳」的演出博得好評以後，接着又上演了「原野」。</p>
<p>這是一　悲劇，劇情雖然簡單，處理相當苦難。</p>
<p>故事是這樣的：被焦閻王殺死了父親，而自己被陷害監禁了八年的仇虎越獄復仇，但焦閻王已經死掉，只　下他的兒子大星和大星的盲母。大星有着一個續娶的妻子金子，金子在從前正是仇虎的情侶。這次看見了仇虎，驚喜非常。然而他們却給大星的盲母知道了。她呌兒子大星吿發這個逃犯，仇虎就把大星殺死；她想報復，却誤殺了她底孫兒，仇虎和金子逃往原野，爲當地偵緝隊所圍，自刎死。</p>
<p>導演是舒適，並擔任男主角仇虎，他是一個富於經騐的演員。大體說來都能令人滿意，但有些地方精神不大貫注，似乎鬆懈了一點，周曼華飾金子，她的台詞流利響亮，動作與表情都能深刻動人，是全劇中最能使觀衆留下深刻印象的一個。喬奇的大星演來後半勝似前半，前半嫌木訥了一點，這樣就不能統一了。蒙納的焦氏演得很能够刻劃一個兇橫頑固，小心眼兒的老嫗，前後始終一貫，確非易事。</p>
<p>其他的演員還能稱職。</p>
<p>音響效果和佈景都能配合着劇情的發展，像大風的怒吼，兩决斑鳩的啼聲。都能使觀衆深深領略劇情，佈景都很好，祇有二，三兩幕似乎嫌擺得太侷促和擁擠。舞臺中間的　子最好能移到空空的左面去，而面神龕旁的小桌也可以去掉，這樣也許能更調和一些。</p>
<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>從影往事及觀感（下）</h3>
<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>——談英女士的談話</p>
<p>這片子當時還只是客串性質，等到後來聯華公司創辦成立，邀我去訂下了三年長期合同，這才脫離學校生活，正式踏進電影界來。然而，糊裏糊塗的過這生活至今已歷八年了，自己想想簡直無營可言，非常慚愧！</p>
<p>對於電影的觀感：我以爲一個藝人的生活該得複雜，多受刺激，能這樣不常哭哭笑笑，飽經閱歷，演起戲來才會得精彩，才會有力量。倘如錦衣肉食，住在高洋樓上長得又白又胖，一些沒有人生况味的體騐，呌他演戲，決然一輩子無法演好。此外，一個女演員想要單靠靑春賣錢，那當然生命極短，決難持久；而眞的表演藝術只是永生的；因為年紀逐漸長大，就不妨做年老角色；假如老而不知其老，那就眞的變作老妖怪而不免自絕於觀衆了。現在，我的年齡還只二十五歲，一顆心却巳靜如止水，自覺甚老。如近演「慾魔」片，飾一辮髮雙垂的天眞爛漫的小姑娘。導演先生雖說我演得很合身份，自己却是強作敷衍，總覺不勝肉麻。</p>
<p>藝術是永生的！我想從這上面越發加勁努力。然而前途茫茫的事亦正未易逆料；我相信：做人只有全憑自己能力向前奮鬥，至於奮鬥結果的成績如何，那又是不用多想的另一問題了。</p>

<h3>星六星紀之六——榮飛飛</h3>
<p>凡是跑跑大都會的人，大槪總見過有一位舞星呌方莉莉的吧，她的舞藝，不亞於金莉莉，應酬工夫，也還不錯，前星期動身到香港去了，當她動身的時候，有許多同伴姊妹，相率到輪船上去送行，其中有一個人，方莉莉竟和她抱頭大突，簡直比親同胞遠要傷心，倒使得其他送行的人詫異起來，你道是什麼緣故呢？一個徒弟問我，我委實猜不出來，隔了一天，她纔把實情對我說明，我是個直爽人，別讓諸位蹩着難受啦，讓我通痛快快的寫了出來罷。</p>
<p>在八一三風雲之前，方莉莉結識下一個知心客人，過了一程，難免珠胎暗結，恰恰在戰雲緊急的當口，她那腹內的小國民，也急於要出世了，不料那小國民的父親，忽然恥於爲父，杜門不出，方莉莉平時做舞女的時候，也無非是財來財去，並沒有什麼積蓄，那時間一筆生產費，可就成了問題了，知心客尋不着，舞塲呢，因受時局影響，一家家關門大吉，同夥姊妹呢，沒有舞票收入，一個個自顧不暇，當然不能去開口借貸，常言道得好，天無絕人之路，當她正在急得上天無路入地無鬥的時候，忽然從惠山上來了一尊活善薩，摒擋着平時積蓄下的一些衣飾，當了二百元錢，一股腦兒的給了她，還要安慰着她說：「舞塲已經開了，這是我先向賬房間借來的，以後跳下舞票，還可以源源接濟。」因此方莉莉纔得安然度過難關，」你要曉得這活菩薩家住那裹，姓字名誰？待我來代她編兩句戲詞唱唱：「未曾開言笑吟吟，尊聲列位聽詳情，家鄉無錫榮巷境，榮飛飛就是奴的名；祇爲家門遭不幸，因此學藝當舞星。」唉！這個年頭，這種熱心義氣朋友是不易得的了，諸位若要訪她，請到大華茶舞一回。</p>

<p>「桃李刧」的劇作者提出了這樣可寶貴的一個問題：不良的環境所造成的惡果，及不合理的社會所釀成的慘案。他在少年富蘭克身上，寄與了同情與喟歎，而將「是誰之咎」留在每一個觀衆的心版上，使人思索，用意深長。</p>
<p>劇本的編製是經過週密的考慮的，如畢業之日，敎師命每一個同學顯一技之長，以示他日再求深造的興趣，來對照偷竊口琴的富蘭克終於犯罪入獄。道該是一部優秀的敎育電影。</p>
<p>可是這個良好的劇木在演出上完全失敗了。第一：全片的調子太慢，重心所在，都不够深入，而失却了力量。即如畢業時候各同學的前後發展，導演者就沒有把握住劇作者所賦予的感人心靈的强烈對比。第二：沒有把全力集中在富蘭克身上，明顯地勾劃着他墮落的過程，而讓橫的發展破壞了情感的昇華。第三：是剪接的紛亂，如最後富蘭克逃獄以後，兼寫校友會開會，在富蘭克逃得很遠以後，才接上一個警備車追逐的鏡頭。富蘭克與諸同學及師長分手那塲戲，果然是本片處理得最動人的一塲戲，情緒氣氛的把握，也够强固，但是剪接的不愼，顯出了時間上的衝突。</p>
<p>一個庸俗的導演對於演員是很大的損失，同樣也能毀滅一個良好的劇本，「桃李刧」的慘遭失敗，是非常可惜的。</p>

<p>兩年來，電影界是缺少梅琳這個人的活動了，不，以梅琳目前的生活環境來推測，也許，也許她底輕盈的笑影，將永遠不會再映在銀幕上啦。</p>
<p>原因是：梅琳爲了某某許多問題與關係，她想把她的一切在觀衆們的腦海中漸漸冲淡，以至於消滅一夏季到了，現在，黑色的砲車把梅林載着在平闊的愛多亞路上飛着，有一個他保護着她，精神是顯得比從前更煥發，更愉快了。薄薄質料的服裝，一三三九的新式製裁襯托出她的身肢的苗條，走起路來的高跟皮鞋聲，那麼清脆而響亮</p>
<p>一般人都知道梅琳就是梅琳，而沒有明白梅琳的原姓原名却是潘兆琳。當時她所以化名，就為了進電影界生怕父母反對。她是上海人，先前在慕爾堂英文學校讀過書，梅琳是美麗的，所以當阮玲玉逝世的時候，她會給人冠上賽阮玲玉的綽號。但，梅琳的天眞是比她的美麗更易惹起觀衆的注意</p>

<h3>Halifax Foreign Secretary Clarifies Key Points of British Far East Policy: Willing to Seek a Solution to the Sino-Japanese War, Handling the Background of the Tianjin Incident Realistically</h3>
<p>Lord Halifax, British Foreign Secretary</p>
<p>(London) During today's Upper House debate on foreign affairs, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax delivered a speech expressing his hope that the day would come when Britain could use its mediation to achieve a fair resolution to the Sino-Japanese War. The Foreign Secretary stated that he believed a solution that fairly treated China while also considering the interests of other powers with relations in the Far East was achievable through well-intentioned human efforts. The Foreign Secretary refuted misunderstandings regarding the recent Anglo-Japanese agreement and reiterated that the British government's policy towards China had not changed. He stated that everything the government had done was to recognize what already seemed to exist and to address the background of the Tianjin situation in a practical manner.</p>
<p>Defending the Tokyo Agreement</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary, responding on behalf of the government, stated that several speeches in the House of Commons asserted that the recent agreement between Britain and Japan represented a fundamental shift in national policy. He noted claims that the agreement recognized the existence of a state of war in China, violating the spirit of Britain's obligations under League of Nations resolutions, posing a danger to British public interests, and that the government's actions had pardoned all past actions that Britain had previously condemned. "All these," the Foreign Secretary said, "are criticisms of the government." He declared that, in his judgement, those who made such arguments had disregarded both the clear terms of the agreement and the government's interpretation of it. The Foreign Secretary stated that, based on his experience in India, he knew it was extremely difficult for people sitting in London to accurately measure the precise meaning contained in any carefully worded plan from one side or the other, especially in the face of extreme national difficulties. "Therefore," he said, "it is difficult for the enemy to find more fertile ground to sow tares in a wheat field." He argued that those who made such sweeping accusations against the agreement ignored the crucial fact that the impression their accusations made that afternoon was precisely the impression that those who wished to increase any difficulties currently facing Britain would like to see created. Therefore, he concluded, critics needed to be careful and not be fooled, and that building great anxieties on the smallest of foundations was unhelpful.</p>
<p>Two Objectives of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>The public should bear in mind that the Japanese government never asked the British government to change its general policy, and that if the Japanese government had made such a request, the British government would never have agreed. What Britain had done through this agreement was to acknowledge all the facts that appeared to exist and to try to deal with the background of the Tianjin situation in a practical way. It would have been difficult to reach a compromise on the Tianjin dispute if misunderstandings had not been listed in the agreement. Sir Robert Craigie (British Ambassador to Japan) was now tackling a very difficult situation with determination and understanding, striving to reach a solution. The government must not make its work more difficult through unnecessary words or deeds. Therefore, the government's actions had not been of a coercive nature, and it hoped that the government would not and should not act in this way in any reasonable circumstance in the future. While the government's policy aimed to promote peace and international order, its efforts had two goals: first, and most importantly, to find a solution that was fair to all parties concerned; and second, from the narrower perspective of British interests, to achieve a result in the current difficulties that did not damage relations between Britain and China or Japan. He knew that many members of the House would regard this as an overly optimistic hope, but he himself felt that the question of whether they could successfully achieve their goals did not depend entirely on themselves, but also on the attitude of the Japanese government and how prepared the Japanese authorities were to distinguish between local events that their government had recognized and general events, and how prepared they were not to regard general events as local events, or local events as general events.</p>
<p>Anti-British Movement is Serious</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the recent remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma when he met with journalists, saying that, according to reports from Sir Robert Craigie, much of what had been reported was inaccurate. If Hiranuma's remarks were indeed misreported, the government could not accept the implications they contained. The British government had to take a very serious view of the blockade of Tianjin and the increasing anti-British movement in the areas occupied by Japanese troops in China. If this movement continued unabated, relations between Britain and Japan would inevitably become more difficult. He believed that both the Japanese government and the public must recognize this point. The Anglo-Japanese agreement stipulated that the Japanese government was responsible for maintaining public order in the areas occupied by Japanese troops in China, so the British government hoped to use this agreement to stop anti-British propaganda in these areas. It was worth remembering that the British government also remembered that several of the points raised, although local in nature, had broader implications and were directly related to other governments.</p>
<p>Maintaining Contact with the US and France</p>
<p>"We have stated that we have common interests with the United States and France in several matters. In general, the objectives of the three governments are closely aligned. The British government attaches great importance to the cooperation between these three governments, and we keep the American and French governments informed of our intentions and actions at all times. This does not mean that the British, American, and French governments should take the same action at the same time. The recent negotiations between the United States regarding trade are an example. I know that the British government could also announce the abrogation of its trade agreement with Japan in the current environment, but as the Prime Minister said on Sunday, this requires extremely careful consideration and close consultation with the various Dominions. Therefore, I do not intend to make any further comments on this matter at this stage."</p>
<p>Recognizing Japan's Position in China</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then responded to a remark by Lord Davies, Vice-Chairman of the League of Nations Union, that the government's actions were driven by a desire to uphold existing rights, saying that he should not ignore a passage in a note that the British government had sent to Japan earlier this year, drawing attention to the fact that Britain had already been engaged in negotiations with the Chinese government on extraterritoriality in 1931, which had almost been completed before being halted by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. However, in the note to Japan, the British government continued to state that it was still prepared to resume these negotiations at an appropriate time and was prepared to discuss such and other issues with a restored and fully independent Chinese government. Therefore, the British government's formation of its policy did not aim to maintain the entire structure of the old treaties unchanged. At the same time, the British government had never concealed its views on Japan's actions in China. "We are fully prepared to acknowledge the special interests and position that Japan demands in China due to its geographical location and economic needs," he said.</p>
<p>Studying Methods to Stabilize Chinese Currency</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary continued, "Regarding the issues of Chinese currency and the disposal of silver deposits in Tianjin, various solutions have been proposed, but none seem satisfactory. The British government is currently continuing to review all possibilities, but when considering these matters, we cannot ignore our obligations to the Chinese government and the other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. Any proposal to continue supporting Chinese currency, whether from a Chinese perspective, is something we believe is necessary, and we will also consider it in light of the many other financial considerations and obligations that Britain currently has."</p>
<p>Importance Attached to Detention of British Military Officer</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary also stated that the detention of British military officer Colonel Spear by the Japanese authorities in Zhangjiakou was extremely unsatisfactory. Sir Robert Craigie had repeatedly made representations to the Japanese government, and the Japanese side had replied that the case was almost fully investigated. A few days ago, the Japanese government had stated that it hoped the case could be resolved soon. The Japanese side had not explained Spear's prolonged detention, and the British government had made its feelings on the matter clear to the Japanese side. As for Spear's diplomatic privileges, he stated that there was no doubt that he enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Expresses Hope in Conclusion</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary concluded his speech by saying that, in view of the various difficult situations in the Far East, those in responsible positions should bear the responsibility of looking to the future and clearing away the obstacles in front of them in order to achieve true goals. In the Far East, this goal was not, as former Foreign Office official Lord Cecil had suggested, about the choice of paths, but seemed to have broader consequences and greater dangers than Cecil had seen, but it must be tried in order to achieve a fair resolution of the current disputes. He hoped that the day would come when Britain could use its good offices to achieve a fair resolution to the Sino-Japanese War and believed that a solution that fairly treated China while also considering the interests of other powers with relations in the Far East was achievable through well-intentioned human efforts. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Questioning by British Upper House Members</h3>
<p>(London) In today's Upper House debate on the Far East situation, opposition leader Lord Snell spoke first, saying that the Far East situation still seemed disappointing. He did not mean that Britain alone was responsible, but he was surprised that the Tokyo agreement had been reached so quickly, unlike the slow progress of the Moscow talks.</p>
<p>Lord Cecil, Chairman of the League of Nations Union, then spoke, saying that he was not enthusiastic about Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement about a fair resolution to the Sino-Japanese War. He believed that this showed that the government was inclined to place China and Japan on an equal footing in this war. He believed that Japan's strategy was the most unjust event in world history. Japan's aim was to first control China, then Asia, and to exclude all European countries and people from any part or business of Asia. The policies of the Japanese militarists were the same as the current policies of Germany, probably because the Japanese militarists were trained by the Germans, who not only taught them military skills, but also instilled in them their views on government and international affairs. He hoped that the Foreign Secretary would inform the Upper House of what parallel steps the British government intended to take regarding the American announcement of the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty. He wanted the government to make a more practical and clearer statement on its Far East policy. The Prime Minister's words made people doubt what the true British Far East policy was. The government should show that it was not afraid of Japanese retaliation. Japan had shown its utter disregard for all international obligations and all principles of fairness, while China had fulfilled all its obligations and acted in an absolutely appropriate manner. He believed that if Britain took actions that benefited Japan and harmed China, it would bring shame to Britain and give the impression of abandoning a country whose actions were well worth supporting. He knew that British territories in the Far East might face naval attacks, which would be difficult for Britain, but what Britain had to consider was what the likelihood was if Japan won in China. If so, everything Britain had would be swept away, because Japan, having destroyed China, would certainly turn to destroying Britain. Based on his experience in diplomatic negotiations with Japan, he knew that every concession to Japan only aroused Japan's insatiable demands. Lord Davies spoke, saying that Britain should support the Chinese government in every way possible and, if necessary, expel Japanese residents in the British Empire and sever economic ties with Japan. Former Home Secretary Lord Muir rose to say that the government should clarify that its remarks regarding the Tokyo agreement applied to the need to support Chinese currency. Now, the Chinese currency system had become the most important point of contention between Britain and Japan. Most of the difficulties in the Far East arose from the Japanese government's contradictory dual policies. Japanese politicians were often overwhelmed by the militarists, and the militarists were held hostage by their junior officers. The British Empire had no reason to allow its own policies to be dictated by the violent actions of colonels and majors in the Japanese army. "We now have every reason to believe that Japan is feeling painfully disappointed in its efforts to conquer China. Japan has had feelings of resentment and panic in the past two years, like a person sinking gradually into the mire. The Japanese militarists feel they must find a scapegoat to vent their resentment and panic, and Britain is now the scapegoat. The United States has moved its fleet from the Atlantic to the Pacific and has abrogated the trade agreement with Japan. These two moves are of great significance. Their motives are not only for their own interests in the Far East."</p>
<h3>British Company Printing Chinese Banknotes, Over 100 Million Sheets</h3>
<p>(London) The Chinese government and the Central Bank have signed contracts with two British printing companies to print banknotes, totaling over 100 million sheets. The exact total or value of the banknotes cannot be disclosed. One of the companies has hired an additional 400 workers to cope with the demand and will need a year to complete the contract. The other contract has already been completed. The printing plates will be kept in Britain, and the banknotes will be shipped to China via various routes. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>"It is also a responsibility to the world in general to act in this way. The American abrogation cannot be said to be purely for commercial reasons; it undoubtedly contains political implications. In this environment, the British government can be encouraged not to adopt any policy of succumbing to pressure. One thing that should be considered by the British government is that Australia has a great stake in all issues in the Pacific, especially in Anglo-Japanese relations. When the Manchurian Incident occurred, Australia's interests certainly had a major influence on the British government's thinking. I sincerely hope that the Australian government and public can understand that a policy of constant retreat is ultimately not a good plan, nor is it in line with the prestige or interests of the British Empire. The government has now taken steps to strengthen Singapore's defenses, which is welcome. If the Tokyo talks fail and Japanese pressure increases, the government should consider taking the same actions as the United States has already taken. If the government decides that it needs twelve months' notice to abrogate the Anglo-Japanese trade agreement, then the whole nation will support it. If so, Britain will have the means to join with the United States in exerting very effective economic pressure on Japan, which can stop supplies to Japan. Without these supplies, Japan will not be able to continue fighting." Former Australian Governor-General Lord Stonehaven rose to defend Australia because Lord Samuel's remarks had involved Australia, saying that Australia had sacrificed its very important trade with Japan for the sake of the entire British Empire. Lord Samuel replied that he did not mean that Australia had taken actions that were detrimental to Britain for its own interests. He only meant that, in the end, it might be necessary to take actions that were more forceful than those required solely by economic interests.</p>
<p>Lord Elibank, Chairman of the British Imperial Chamber of Commerce, asked the Foreign Secretary to state firmly to the Upper House that the government had no intention of handing over the silver deposits in Tianjin or recognizing the banknotes of the North China United Reserve Bank, because the Prime Minister's remarks on the matter in the Lower House were not very clear. Lord Elibank spoke of Japan's military position in China, saying that the adverse trend in Japan's trade balance was increasing, its gold reserves were decreasing, and the Chinese guerrilla warfare was preventing Japan from obtaining supplies of iron, coal, and cotton. Japan had suffered defeats in North China, and Soviet pressure was also reportedly forcing it to withdraw troops to Manchuria. In view of these facts, there was no possibility that Japan would declare war on Britain if Britain insisted. He believed that the moderates would eventually control the radicals, and Japan was not lacking in thoughtful people. Therefore, on the one hand, the Tokyo talks should be conducted, and on the other hand, preparations should be made to cooperate with the United States to take action. Britain should now take more forceful action. There would soon be a stalemate, at which time mediation could be conducted to end the war. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Negotiations Still Stalled, Japan Continues Anti-British Demonstrations</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned that after receiving a report from Sir Robert Craigie, British Ambassador to Japan, on the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, the British government has not yet telegraphed its views to Sir Robert Craigie. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) 25,000 people from the city's commercial district held a demonstration in front of the British Embassy today, carrying flags with slogans such as "Down with Britain." Five representatives delivered a resolution to Mr. Cunningham of the British Embassy. Anti-British movements have also occurred in other cities in Japan. At the same time, Japanese newspapers are pessimistic about the progress of the British negotiations. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain's Wishes for the Far East</h3>
<p>Britain's Far East policy, having been declared by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons on July 31, was, three days later, the day before yesterday, again addressed by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in the House of Lords; the objects were the same, the matter was consistent, and the content was similar. This newspaper has already commented on Mr. Chamberlain's statements; now, regarding Mr. Halifax's statements, we will elaborate on what our previous discussion did not cover, grasping the essentials.</p>
<p>In the Foreign Secretary's speech, three points were particularly striking: first, the main goal of British policy was to seek a fair solution to the Far East crisis, taking into account the interests of all parties concerned, and then, on a smaller scale, taking into account Britain's own interests; but in its conduct, seeking to avoid harming the relations between China and Britain, and seeking to achieve this, contingent on the attitudes of China and Japan. Second, Britain did not seek to insist on various old privileges in China, as evidenced by the 1931 negotiations with the Chinese government on extraterritoriality; showing that Britain did not seek to adhere to established conventions, and did not seek to preserve the entire structure of the old treaties. Third, Britain would never condone aggression, but Japan, based on its geographical position and economic needs, had the right to demand and exercise special interests and positions in China, which Britain was fully prepared to recognize. These three points, when Britain discussed its Far East policy in the past, just as Prime Minister Chamberlain declared a week ago, often made similar revelations, but never as frankly as the Foreign Secretary said the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>What we should first clearly recognize is that the three points mentioned above by Mr. Halifax are Britain's wishes for the Far East in the future, not the policies that the British government is currently advancing in the Far East. From the wishes held to the advancement of policies, there is an immeasurable distance in both time and space, and even from the beginning of the advancement to the final decision of success or failure, there are not only immeasurable distances, but also countless detours. Therefore, we, living today, do not need to engage in flights of fancy about how the problem will be during the advancement of those wishes, and what the scene will be after realization, just because the British Foreign Secretary stated his wishes. However, there is something worth praising, which is that the first item mentioned above, called seeking a solution and calling it fair; fairness has its inevitable standards, not a vague phrase, not an empty cliché; moreover, seeking it without hindering the relations between China and Britain, it is especially impossible to seek completeness without fairness; this is praiseworthy. The second item mentioned above, called Britain's various things in China, must take the completely independent and autonomous Chinese government as its opponent; not wavering slightly, not allowing borrowing, transparent and firm, upright and wise; although it is said that things have a true position, how will Japan's treatment of China differ from Britain's treatment of France? How is the so-called economic need similar to Britain's treatment of India? If the so-called maintaining special, will there be another explanation other than the general international so-called preferential treatment, another explanation other than the open door and equal opportunity? All such things, the interpretation can be varied, the citation can be borrowed; but the Foreign Secretary said that he was fully prepared to recognize it, what is his intention? However, considering the full text of the Foreign Secretary's speech, it is absolutely impossible to pick and choose the third item mentioned above out of context and distort it; this is what we deeply believe in his original intention, and we only think that it would be better if it were not said like that.</p>
<p>Britain's wishes for the Far East are like this; Britain's economic and naval power are like that; using that power to extend these wishes, there are two ways. Accuse Japan of righteousness, inform Japan of the gains and losses, persuade Japan step by step, so that Japan can recognize Britain's wishes, abandon its aggressive actions, and jointly seek a fair solution. On the Chinese side, apart from the integrity of sovereignty, territory and administration, there is no other request; it is neither the initiator of the Far East dispute, nor does it bear the responsibility for the Far East dispute; in short, the key is not in China. This is one way, and it is probably what the British authorities most hope for; unfortunately, the Japanese are busy rejecting Britain, at least today, it is completely the opposite. Britain and China have a long history, close interests, and especially agree on international concepts and moral beliefs, and the origins of the two countries are far away; however, Britain's so-called rights and interests in China have not yet been considered deeply rooted; why, Britain must be in harmony with China, and must obtain the support of a completely independent and autonomous government of China, and Britain can maintain its rights and interests, try to prove with how Britain is in North China today, how it is in the Yangtze River Basin, how it is in southern Guangdong, and it is true that there is a relationship between the skin and the hair. Therefore, if Britain seeks to realize its wishes, in reality, it can only do its best to be of one heart and one mind with China.</p>
<h3>British Government Willing to Peacefully Resolve Dispute with Japan, Prime Minister Admits Navy is Out of Reach, Preserving Strength to Cope with European Events</h3>
<p>(London) At today's morning meeting of the House of Commons, opposition Labor MP Baker raised questions about the Far East issue, to which Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "At present, the strength of our navy in the Far East is not as great as Japan's, but this is not the case in Europe. Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to send a fleet to the Far East, but on the other hand, it is better to resolve disputes with Japan and discuss them through negotiations rather than using force, provided that the basic concepts and principles that we recognize are not harmed. Even if we decide to protect our expatriates in China by the final means, I am afraid it will be difficult to protect them all. In short, I am afraid that most of them cannot be protected, but we have an obligation to them and must always keep it in mind. Their situation is already precarious, and we should, within the possible range, not let them fall into an even more dangerous situation. Regarding the current negotiations in Tokyo, we have made it clear to the Japanese government that the issues of silver deposits in Tianjin and Chinese currency cannot be resolved by the British and Japanese governments alone. These issues are so closely related to each other that they not only involve our country, but also involve other countries, and must be discussed with other countries before they can be resolved." It is said that according to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference (previously held in Brussels, Belgium in November 1937), the declaration and the resolutions of the League of Nations, Britain has accepted the constraint to aid China and should declare the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty abolished. In fact, our country has not accepted any constraint to abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty. Even if the treaty is abolished at this time, it will not take effect until twelve months later. Attached agreements must also be taken into account. "We have, under duress, accepted several extremely important responsibilities and constraints in Europe, and if something happens in the future, we must participate in the war. We could have accepted the same constraints in the Far East, but I am unwilling to do so. Although the magnitude of our country's resources is difficult to estimate, and the will of the people is very strong, we must be prudent in accepting a constraint, and there is a certain limit. It is said that the accidents that are currently occurring in the Far East are infuriating, and I really have the same feeling, and after hearing about certain incidents and reading certain documents, my blood pressure soars, but even if the emotions are extremely impulsive, we cannot forget the obligations that our country has accepted and the situation of the men and women in the Far East. More serious problems closer to our country may occur in the next few months, and we must consider them. Our country must preserve its strength to cope with all events," he said. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Labor Party Member of Parliament Condemns Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, the House of Commons held its last session of this term. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and Soviet Ambassador Maisky were both present in the diplomatic seating area. Opposition Labour Party member of parliament, Baker, immediately initiated a debate on the Far East issue, stating that Japan is using extortion to force others to recognize its actions in China as legitimate. There have been thousands of incidents of British nationals being insulted. Japan's ultimate goal is to expel Westerners from Asia. "They are now using every means of tyranny to force our country to become an accomplice in the invasion of China. When the Tokyo negotiations began, our party expressed its concerns. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels once said that this negotiation is the Munich Conference of the East, which makes us even more uneasy. Furthermore, after the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement (signed on April 16, 1938), everything we gave to Italy has been taken away, and that country has not given us anything in return. This is a lesson to be learned. Prime Minister Chamberlain has stated that the Tokyo plan (referring to the preliminary Anglo-Japanese agreement) does not mean a change in Far Eastern policy, and that China's rights under international law will not be affected as a result. I am very pleased to hear this and would like to thank the Prime Minister. However, the Prime Minister must know how this plan is being interpreted by certain parties. Japan has no right to invade China. Whatever the intentions of our government when signing this plan, it is within certain limits. Recognizing the legitimacy of the Japanese government's actions in China, that government has used this plan as a starting point to propose various conditions, which are very broad and cannot be accepted. That country has also demanded that the British concessions maintain neutrality and proposed that the police departments of the British concessions should be jointly managed by Britain and Japan. However, the behavior of the Tianjin police, if it is the same as that of the Japanese police elsewhere, is truly frightening. As for the four Chinese suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, since the Japanese side has not presented evidence of the crime, it is not appropriate to extradite them. There are no legitimate courts in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. If these suspects are brought before a puppet court for trial, it would be tantamount to recognizing the puppet organization, which is unacceptable. Furthermore, regarding the 48 million Chinese currency of silver stored in the Tianjin concession, this is the property of the Chinese government and should not be transferred to the puppet government, because we cannot recognize it as a legitimate government. In addition, the Japanese government has also demanded that the circulation of legal tender be prohibited in the Tianjin concession and forced people of all kinds to accept the 'worthless paper money' issued by the 'North China United Reserve Bank.' This is the fundamental issue of the Tokyo negotiations. If we refuse to accept these demands, the Japanese side will declare the negotiations broken. But I dare to believe that the government authorities will issue a statement that these demands cannot be accepted, whether before or after seeking the opinions of the countries concerned. If the British government prohibits the circulation of Chinese legal tender in the concessions, it would be tantamount to recognizing the puppet government as a legitimate government, which is contrary to the policy announced by the British government on January 14 of this year, namely, to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty and safeguard China's political, cultural, and economic independence. At this point, the guerrilla tactics adopted by China are the only major factor in the Sino-Japanese war. Regarding the silver issue, Japan's real goal is to eliminate this guerrilla movement, which is just a pretext. If we allow Japan to be satisfied, then Britain's prestige in Asia will be swept away, and the same will be true elsewhere. The best course of action now is to declare that China is part of the peace front. I also ask the government to support Chinese legal tender and declare the abrogation of the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty. At the same time, I also ask the French government to provide credit loans to China," (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 4th).</p>

<h3>Strength Gradually Exhausted, Japanese Offensive in Taihang Mountains Fails, Chinese Forces Recover Important Towns, Japanese Lines of Communication Severed</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) A telegram from Chongqing reports that the Japanese army launched an offensive in five directions against the Chinese forces' positions in the Taihang Mountains last month, with a fierce momentum. However, the Chinese forces avoided direct confrontation and attacked the weakest points of the Japanese army from the flanks. As a result, the strength of the Japanese army was gradually exhausted, and it has now completely failed. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to launch a counter-offensive and successively recovered more than ten important towns. The Japanese lines of communication have been severed, leaving them isolated and without support, making it even more difficult to supply them. The breaching of the Qinshui River serves as the greatest obstacle to the Japanese army's activities (Special dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here, the war in Shanxi has now shifted to southern Shanxi. The Japanese army originally concentrated a large number of troops along the Daoxiao Railway, attempting to advance eastward to Linqi on the border of Shanxi and Henan and to eliminate the Chinese guerrillas in the Taihang Mountains. At present, most of the Japanese army has arrived in Changzhi, taking the road to Lucheng to attack Weizi Town. It is believed that they will join up with another Japanese force advancing from Shicheng to Licheng and Dongyangguan. As for the Japanese army in Dongyuan, southern Henan, they have been forced to retreat towards the Pinghan Railway (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<h3>No Trace of Japanese Along Zhongshan Coast</h3>
<p>Zhaoqing The Chinese army in Zhongshan, in coordination with local self-defense forces, launched a counter-offensive against the Japanese troops stationed near Hengmen at 6 PM on the 31st, and recovered Hengmen, Dajianshan, Furongshan, Yangtianluo, Boliwei, and other places. The Japanese were forced to return to their ships and fled towards Bao'an. The Japanese troops who had invaded [illegible] were also repulsed by the fierce counterattacks of the Chinese army and retreated at noon on the 1st. There is now no trace of the Japanese along the Zhongshan coast (Dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the Chinese army in Zhongshan, Guangdong, has been greatly reinforced and has launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the Japanese troops who landed in Zhongshan last week. As a result, the Japanese troops in that area have retreated to the coast, and the Japanese warships that had previously covered the landing of the Japanese troops have also departed. Although the blockade of Hengmen has been broken by the Japanese, the position of the Chinese army has been greatly strengthened after moving into new positions, which is sufficient to prevent the Japanese army from continuing to advance (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<h3>Henan Battles, Chinese Forces Highly Successful, Japanese Troops in Wanhedian Abandon Corpses and Retreat, Chinese Forces in Hubei Attacking Qianjiang</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese military news, the Chinese forces have been highly successful in the battles in southern Henan. The Japanese troops in Wanhedian abandoned seventy corpses on the battlefield and retreated in haste. Their panic and haste were far from their former discipline.

The Japanese troops in Qianjiang are now destroying the roads around the suburbs in an attempt to hinder the Chinese offensive. In northern Hunan, the Chinese army is pursuing the Japanese army to the Taolin area. In eastern Hubei, the Chinese army has also achieved considerable victories. Hexingdian (transliteration) and Wulidian have been occupied by the Chinese army. However, after occupying Wulidian, the Chinese army set fire to the Japanese camp and its warehouse and then withdrew.

<h3>Amidst Anti-British Movement, New Atrocities in Tianjin, Missionaries in Various Places Mostly Forced to Retreat, Japanese Consul in Tianjin Bans Publication of Anti-British News, U.S. Side Issues Strongly Worded Note</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, a group of Chinese anti-British rioters, instigated by the Japanese, broke into the International Trading Company, which is run by the British, and destroyed all the glass windows and furniture. Many of the valuable equipment was thrown into the Hai River. The British staff of the company, seeing that the situation was not good, fled to the nearby Texaco Company, which is run by Americans, and were unharmed. The British merchants here who have offices and factories here have expressed their worries (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the outbreak of anti-British movements in various parts of North China, seventy Britons, mostly missionaries, have voluntarily or been forced to retreat from various places. Three family members of missionary James Ning in Linfen, Shanxi, were evacuated at the end of June because rioters broke into their house and destroyed their property. Four missionaries from Xihongdong were forced to leave the country because rioters used the same methods. Ten Britons evacuated from Xianfeng. Three Britons and one Danish woman were forced to go from Xi'an to Bian. British Baptist missionaries Mr. and Mrs. Smith voluntarily left Qin County, Shanxi, and returned to Beiping via Taiyuan. They claimed that fourteen British Baptist missionaries and two British Salvation Army members were warned to leave the country as soon as possible. Sixteen people were counted from Taiyuan to Shijiazhuang, but no news has been received from Shijiazhuang. They may have been blocked by railway damage, or have returned to Taiyuan, or have gone north from Taiyuan to Datong in northern Shanxi. Eight Canadian missionaries in Anyang (Zhangde) in northern Henan, because of the intense anti-British movement there, all the servants they hired have resigned. Ms. London Chipley died of typhoid fever during the riots. Six Canadian missionaries in Beiping intend to return to their original residence. Twenty to thirty Britons in Jinan were warned to leave the country within two weeks. Two weeks have passed, but no news has been received as to whether they have left the country. The Kaifeng Anti-British Committee decided to continue the anti-British movement. The Beiping Anti-British Committee, "in order to expand anti-British propaganda and to draw the attention of residents," erected an electric light slogan "Down with the British" on the drum tower on Tiananmen Square near the Forbidden City. The Catholic Church in Guilin County, Guangxi, was bombed to the ground by Japanese planes on July 31 (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>Changde Front line reports that the Yueyang Gospel Church has recently been dismantled by the Japanese, and all British and American missionaries have been expelled. The oil towers of the Mobil Oil Company in Chenglingji have also been destroyed, and the employees of the company have all fled (Dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to news here today, the American Consul General here has handed a strongly worded note to the Japanese Consul General here, asking the Japanese side to take full responsibility for protecting the lives and property of Americans in Kaifeng, Henan. The reason for the American Consul's note is that the anti-British movement in Kaifeng has a strong tendency to become a general anti-foreign movement. Therefore, the Japanese side must be made to prevent the anti-British movement from turning into an anti-American movement. The American side also protested against the occupation of the Mobil Oil Depot in Chenglingji by the Japanese army on July 1. The Japanese side has promised to investigate. According to the American side, when the Japanese army occupied the Mobil Oil Depot in Chenglingji, they tore down and destroyed the American flag and completely expelled the Chinese staff (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A Haitong News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources that the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin has recently notified Chinese newspapers to stop publishing news of the anti-British movement from tomorrow (Haitong dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to American tourists who arrived in Beiping, the Japanese organized an anti-British committee in Taiyuan and expelled the sixteen British Baptist missionaries there. It was said that one evening, while the church was holding Sunday service, three trucks filled with anti-British vigilantes arrived and surrounded the church. After the service was over, all 150 Chinese people gathered in the church were arrested and imprisoned. Women and children were released three days later. The Anti-British Committee told the missionaries that if they did not leave Taiyuan, all the Chinese in the church would face ominous fates or even be executed. In order to protect the lives of the Chinese and avoid being tortured, the missionaries agreed to leave and closed the church and hospital. The missionaries are now stranded in Shijiazhuang due to flooding and must wait for the water to recede before they can continue their journey (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<h3>Situation in Tianjin Concessions Still Not Improving, Suburbs Flooded, Prices Soaring</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, the food situation in the British Concession has not improved. The stalls in the vegetable market are all empty. The vegetable market in the French Concession is fortunate to have been provided with some supplies through the efforts of the French authorities, but this is only enough to meet the needs of the French Concession (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A few days ago, the Hai River was very crowded. Large and small ships were parked from Special District 1 to the International Bridge. Now it is unusually deserted. Only a few barges and tugboats are occasionally seen sailing in it. According to a Reuters investigation, it was learned that the various shipping companies have decided that all ships will stop in Tanggu and no longer sail upstream because the high water level makes it extremely dangerous for the ships to turn around. A Reuters reporter personally saw a small Japanese ship turning around on the Bund outside the British Concession this morning. Because the river was turbulent, it almost had an accident. It was only after proper handling that it was able to get out of danger and sail downstream. Although the river water has not continued to rise, some low-lying areas in Special District 2 have become swamps (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Because the roads outside the city and the suburbs are still submerged in floods, the prices of various foods are continuing to rise, especially vegetables. Most people here believe that if the roads in the suburbs are not repaired early, prices will break all previous records. At the same time, there is a great shortage of pork here. Restaurants and hotels have removed dishes that use pork from the menu. Chinese newspapers here have expressed great concern about this. It is said that the reason for the shortage of pork is that Tongzhou, the area where pigs are produced, is still flooded, and new goods cannot be leveled. At the same time, most of the goods here have been transported to Tianjin, so this situation has been formed. The price of pork here has increased from 34 cents a catty to 1.20 yuan a catty and continues to rise. Unscrupulous merchants are also hoarding other goods. Although the rain has stopped in various parts of Hebei, the rivers are still flooding. From Beiping south to Baoding, all are flooded. British missionaries who were forced to come to Beiping from Shanxi and Henan have not been able to arrive here today due to railway traffic disruptions (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>(Tianjin) This morning, a Chinese policeman reported to the British Engineering Bureau that he had seen a car with several people inside, possibly Chinese, driving straight into the Hai River when he was on duty on the Bund outside the British Concession this morning. When he was about to go forward to inquire, the car disappeared. Judging from the tire tracks on the Bund, it is likely that the car has fallen into the river. He immediately began to salvage it and the police sent people to investigate the truth about the car and the passengers. This afternoon, the car was found in the river and has been salvaged to the shore, but there was no one in the car. The car door was locked, and the doors and windows were smashed. It has now been determined that the car belongs to a Chinese man. It is said that his son and a girlfriend are now missing (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).</p>

<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this morning, Conservative MP Adams and Opposition Labour MP Henderson both raised questions about the situation in the Free City of Danzig. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately replied, "The Free City has been intensifying military and semi-military activities for several weeks. Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement on the 31st of last month, saying that the British government is closely monitoring the situation and is closely exchanging views with the Polish government" (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 4th).</p>
<p>Warsaw News has been received here from the Free City of Danzig, stating that the city is still actively making military preparations, as can be seen from the following facts: (1) The German Air Force of the city is scheduled to hold exercises at Lanfu Airport on the evening of the 4th of this month.

(5) The roads leading directly to the border of East Prussia have been closed to traffic in order to build defensive fortifications along the road, and the road surface has been thickened to allow military trucks and heavy artillery to pass through. (6) National Socialist Party leader Fuster inspected the defensive fortifications on the Polish border yesterday and toured the Maxko area, the military center of Danzig. It is said that the Danzig army will concentrate in that area in the future (Havas dispatch on the 3rd).</p>

The lower reaches of the rivers where the major commercial cities are located have mostly been occupied by Japanese troops, so the minimal amount of export trade is not even worth mentioning. The complexity of the currency is also a reason for the decline in trade. He hopes that the currency issue, like that between Britain and Japan, can be resolved satisfactorily. We have done our best to protect the interests of the bank, but the future is difficult to predict. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Franco-Soviet Military Talks: Soviet Representatives Appointed, Including Voroshilov and Four Others; Britain to Define "Indirect Aggression"</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Anglo-French military delegation is expected to arrive here on August 11th. The Soviet government has appointed Army Commissar Voroshilov, Navy Commissar Kuznetsov, Chief of Staff Shaposhnikov, Air Force Chief of Staff Loktionov, and Deputy Chief of Staff Smorodinov as Soviet representatives. All of these individuals hold positions just below the highest authorities of the defense organization, so it is widely expected that the future negotiations will be extremely important. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The staff officers from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will soon hold talks in Moscow. The French military delegation, led by General Doumenc, the commander of the Lille garrison, departed this morning for London to meet with the British military delegation, and will then travel together to Moscow tomorrow. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the staff talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British and French military delegations are scheduled to depart from Tilbury, England, at 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, arriving in Leningrad in approximately nine days. This military delegation consists of seventeen staff officers from the army, navy, and air force, all of whom are familiar with foreign armies and proficient in French and Russian. The duration of their stay in Moscow is yet to be determined. The British side believes that five or six weeks are needed, but the Soviet side stated that the presence of the British and French military delegations in Moscow should be of a semi-permanent nature in order to facilitate close cooperation between the staff departments of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This is necessary even after the dangerous period of August and September has passed. In any case, the mission of the British and French military delegations is not only to conclude a military agreement with the Soviet Union, but also to determine the methods of contact between the three countries' armies. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, it is reported that persons close to the government have stated that the Foreign Office will shortly send a new directive by telegram to Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, instructing him to make a final effort to reach a compromise on the issue of "indirect aggression," so that the tripartite political agreement can be concluded before the staff officers of Britain and France arrive in Moscow. It is rumored that the content of the new directive divides "indirect aggression" into two types: (1) If military preparations against the Soviet Union are carried out in the territory of a third country, then Britain and France need not exchange opinions with the Soviet Union and should immediately provide assistance to the Soviet Union. Any construction of defenses, military roads, highways or railways, emplacement of artillery positions, construction of military airfields, or concentration of troops in a third country can be regarded as military preparations against the Soviet Union. (2) If individuals with obvious leanings towards National Socialism join the government of a third country, then Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may, at the suggestion of the Soviet Union, exchange opinions and plan a response. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax, in a speech delivered in the House of Lords this afternoon, addressed the general international situation and the progress of the Moscow negotiations in the final section. He said, "The task of drafting a diplomatic document that takes into account all kinds of situations is extremely complex, and differences of opinion are inevitable as a result. This is why Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have not yet reached a compromise on the definition of indirect aggression. "Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are all seeking a way to take into account all kinds of indirect aggression without hindering the independence or neutrality of third countries, and consultations are still underway." It is said that it is unnecessary for the British government to send cabinet members to Moscow because Britain's sincerity in establishing a political agreement is evident from the fact that the staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are about to begin talks. Regarding the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the Foreign Secretary stated briefly that the government is paying close attention to the developments. Britain's position has already been explained to the House of Commons by Prime Minister Chamberlain on July 10th. (The Prime Minister stated briefly that if any party attempts to unilaterally change the existing system of Danzig, then the survival and independence of the Polish nation would be affected, and it would not be regarded as a local event. Britain has provided Poland with guarantees, and once that country considers that its vital interests are threatened, then the guarantee measures should be implemented.) "In short, we have done our best to organize the forces of peace and prevent war. At this moment, we must remain calm and united, not overemphasize any rumors, and be neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic. That is the proper course of action." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Five-Minister Conference Discusses Countermeasures to the Current Situation; Shiratori and Oshima Suggest Government Urge Participation in German-Italian Alliance</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government convened a five-minister conference at the Prime Minister's official residence from 1:00 PM today. Those in attendance included Prime Minister Hiranuma, Navy Minister Yonai, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Finance Minister Hyakuta. After the Army Minister reported on the general situation in China, they also discussed the handling of the Incident and other matters. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM. (Domei, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After a meeting held yesterday by Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori and Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima at Villa d'Este on Lake Como, it is reported that they have telegraphed their government, requesting to join the German-Italian political and military alliance treaty. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to political figures here, as a result of a meeting held yesterday by Japanese Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in, Army Minister Itagaki, and Inspector General of Military Education Nishio, it was decided to recommend to the government that it strengthen its ties with the Axis powers of Germany and Italy. It is widely expected that the form of the so-called enhanced relationship will be a military agreement. Before the meeting, Army Minister Itagaki had first convened a meeting of the bureau chiefs of the Ministry of the Army and the Chief of the Army General Staff, and reported on the recent developments in Japan's relations with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Colonel Mutō, the Japanese military expert who participated in the Anglo-Japanese talks, stood up and stated that Britain was attempting to discuss political issues and economic matters separately, but in reality, they should not be separated and should be discussed comprehensively in terms of Japan's overall national security. Political figures believe that the reason why Japanese military personnel have proposed strengthening relations with Germany and Italy is to respond to the strengthening of Britain's attitude in the Tokyo negotiations and the announcement by the United States of the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori and Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Ōshima, along with several subordinates including military attaches, recently arrived in Villa d'Este on Lake Como, where they immediately held a meeting to discuss the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Pact. The meeting lasted for three hours. Afterwards, they issued a statement, stating briefly that what was discussed was the issue of close cooperation between Japan and the Axis powers in current policies. "The fact that we chose Villa d'Este, having previously held talks in Rome and Berlin, is not a coincidence. This is a good sign, because the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy once held a meeting and signed an agreement in the same place, strengthening the powers of two countries that maintain friendly relations and promoting prosperity. These two countries certainly maintain friendly relations with Japan." The ambassadors will stay in Villa d'Este for a short period, returning to their posts at the end of this week. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) After the Japanese ambassadors to Italy and Germany held a meeting and issued a statement on Lake Como yesterday, political observers here generally regard Japan's joining the German-Italian military alliance as a question. Most of them also said that, "Since the military attaches of the Japanese embassies in Germany and Italy have already participated in the meeting, the country will definitely join this alliance. The statement issued by the ambassadors mentioned the talks held by the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy in May of this year (the two countries subsequently signed a military alliance treaty), which shows that it is of significance. Former Japanese Army Minister General Terauchi and former Navy Minister Admiral Osumi are about to lead a delegation to Germany and Italy for visits, which is also extremely important." In addition, some observers said, "Japan may not join this alliance. The meeting held by the Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy is purely a diplomatic tactic, and its targets are none other than the negotiations being conducted between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, the negotiations being conducted between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow, and the U.S. government's abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The ambassadors' statement is also intended to warn Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union that whether Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance depends on whether Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are hostile to the expansionist policies that the country is pursuing in China. Since the United States abrogated the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Britain's attitude has become stronger, and Japan has openly expressed its solidarity with the Rome-Berlin axis."

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Continually Invade Chongqing: Air Raid Again Last Morning Under Moonlight; All Consulates Affected; Fierce Air Battles Occurred; Rumors of Two Japanese Aircraft Shot Down</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) On the morning of the 4th, two groups of Japanese aircraft, a total of 18 planes, attacked Chongqing again by moonlight. The first group of nine aircraft dropped bombs on the eastern suburbs of the city and escaped after being heavily fired upon by Chinese anti-aircraft guns. The second group of nine aircraft also attacked near the city suburbs. The Chinese air force launched a fierce attack on them. A portion of the Japanese aircraft invaded the city's airspace, and Chinese aircraft pursued them again. The Japanese aircraft dropped many incendiary and explosive bombs in the city suburbs and fled eastward. After investigation, one place caught fire after being hit. Liu Zhi personally went to inspect the disaster situation. Fortunately, the fire brigade's rescue was effective, and the fire did not spread. (Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The capital of the Chinese government, Chongqing, was bombed again last night by Japanese aircraft. Twenty-seven Japanese aircraft attacked in formation. Chinese aircraft took off to engage them, resulting in one Japanese aircraft being shot down. The Japanese aircraft dropped many bombs, causing a raging fire. The extent of the damage is under investigation. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Last night, Japanese planes bombed Chongqing twice. The British and French consulates and the German embassy were severely damaged. The residences of American journalists were also affected. Twenty foreigners, including senior consulate officials, narrowly escaped death when three bombs exploded in the consulate area. When a house between the British and French consulates was hit by a Japanese bomb, four Chinese were killed instantly. When another bomb exploded outside the German consulate, three Chinese were killed. The windows of the British and French consulates were damaged, and plaster fell from the walls. The German embassy was severely damaged. The British Chargé d'Affaires and the Deputy Consul in Chongqing narrowly escaped death when Japanese bombs exploded within 100 yards of their air-raid shelters. British female visitor Bainfair took refuge in the air-raid shelter of the British consulate and escaped injury. Another bomb exploded 300 yards from the French consulate, but French Consul Midart was not injured. The residence of the New York Times reporter and former editor of the Shanghai Continental Daily, Durdin, was completely destroyed by a 200-pound bomb. Durdin and his wife, as well as their friend Mr. Snow (famous for his writings on the Red Army), all escaped. Fires broke out in houses near the British and French consulates and the German embassy. Japanese aircraft bombs also fell on the south bank of the Yangtze River and the western suburbs of Chongqing. Although there were few casualties in the city, officials believe that, since the people have evacuated Chongqing city, many refugees have gathered in the four suburbs of Chongqing city, and the casualties there must be high. Last night's Japanese attack on Chongqing was the first recorded instance of Chongqing being bombed three times in one week since the Sino-Japanese War. Chinese fighter planes drove away the first wave of Japanese bombers, but the second wave of Japanese bombers invaded from the western district. Chinese fighter planes and Japanese bombers engaged in the most spectacular and fierce air battle since June 25th. According to reliable sources, at least one Japanese aircraft was shot down by the Chinese army. Although the number of Chinese fighter planes participating in the battle was small, they fought bravely, firing fiercely at the Japanese aircraft with machine guns around them.

<p>(Chongqing) According to the military authorities here today, Chongqing's night-time air defense system is considered to be sound. This point can be proven by the results of the recent nightly attacks by Japanese aircraft. The efficiency of the searchlight team is particularly admirable, because they can not only discover the location of Japanese aircraft when they appear in the sky, but also follow the Japanese aircraft with their light, not relaxing in the slightest, so that the Japanese aircraft have nowhere to hide, and the anti-aircraft gun team can fully exert its power. The efficiency of the fire brigade and ambulance team has also greatly improved. Therefore, after the recent Japanese aircraft bombings, although fires still broke out, they were extinguished by the Chinese fire brigade within half an hour. As for the transportation of the wounded to hospitals for treatment and the clearing of the dead, they can also be completed separately before the alarm is lifted. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, Japanese aircraft again came to Chongqing to attack. The British Consul's residence suffered minor damage. Staff member Ponsted and Acting Consul Mackenzie were both in the residence, but escaped injury. The residence of the French Consulate's medical officer and the German Consulate were completely destroyed. The residence of the New York Times reporter Mr. and Mrs. Baudendistel was also destroyed, but fortunately the two took shelter in a nearby cellar and escaped disaster. The French Consulate's medical officer's residence was only eight yards away from the British Consul's residence and was completely destroyed by a bomb. Shortly after midnight, Japanese bombers attempted to break through the Chinese fighter plane formation circling in the city's airspace. They tried their best to find opportunities to evade the Chinese fighter planes. The fighter planes repelled the Japanese aircraft twice in the sky over the suburbs. At 2:30 AM, several Japanese aircraft finally entered the city limits. Chinese aircraft pursued them closely, but the Japanese aircraft dived downward in an attempt to increase speed, flying quickly through the city and suddenly dropping bombs in the upper city area near the foreign consulates. Several fires broke out, which were extinguished one after another. The last fire was extinguished at dawn. After the alarm was lifted at 3:30 AM, the Reuters reporter went to observe the bombed area. Traffic between the western suburbs of the city and the bombed area in the upper city was blocked due to fires on the main streets. The fire brigade worked bravely. The reporter saw several people risk climbing the roofs of buildings close to the flames to pull down nearby houses in order to inject water hoses into the fire. Around the fire scene, ambulance teams applied initial dressings to the injured before carrying them away. Police Commander Liu Zhi personally directed the rescue work. According to a communiqué issued by the authorities, eighteen Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing in two groups this morning. The first group of nine aircraft bombed the commercial airfield below Chongqing city. A portion of the second group bombed the upper city area. It is reported that several Japanese aircraft also bombed Central University, which is located ten miles west of Chongqing, but this information has not yet been verified. The anti-aircraft guns did not fire this morning so that the Chinese fighter planes could fight the Japanese aircraft in the sky. According to eyewitnesses, at least two Japanese bombers were shot down in the air battle. One exploded and fell in the sky, and the other crashed in Nanzhuang, southwest of Chongqing. It is reported that many people were killed or injured in Wenquan, south of the Yangtze River, because residents believed that the area was safe and did not take precautions. No foreigners were killed or injured. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>A Small Leopard in the Air-Raid Shelter</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) When Japanese aircraft bombed here at 2:10 AM and 2:50 AM this morning, the Chinese people sheltering in the air-raid shelter of the Canadian church were quite threatened by a small leopard brought from Chengdu by Professor Campbell of West China University. This small leopard, which is native to western Sichuan and is only four months old, also showed signs of panic during the Japanese aircraft bombing. As a result, it bared its teeth and claws and rushed back and forth in the crowd, almost causing the Chinese people in the air-raid shelter to forget the terror of the Japanese aircraft and only pay attention to this small leopard. It is reported that Professor Campbell has now obtained permission from the Chinese government to transport this leopard to the United States. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province's Educational Expenses for the 28th Year Approved by the Executive Yuan: More Than 2.59 Million Yuan for Regular and Temporary Expenditures, an Increase of More Than 780,000 Yuan Compared to Last Year</h3>
<p>(Lishui Correspondence) Since the outbreak of the war two years ago, the Zhejiang provincial educational authorities have stepped up their guidance, and wartime education work has been quite active. Its work progress has been commended by the Ministry of Education, which has allowed it to promote compulsory education and find ways to relieve students who have lost their schooling and employment, with even more significant results. Chairman Huang Shaohong regards wartime education as an urgent task at the moment, so in order to continue to enhance the effectiveness of education work, the educational expenses for the 28th year should be specially increased, and social public righteous education should be universally promoted in order to enhance the wartime public power. It is learned that the newly revised general budget of educational and cultural expenses for the 28th year has been transferred by the provincial government to the regular meeting of the Central Executive Yuan in Chongqing for discussion and approval. It is estimated that the regular expenses will be 2,484,677 yuan, the temporary expenses will be 113,900 yuan, and the total will be 2,598,577 yuan, which is an increase of 781,875 yuan compared to the 1,816,702 yuan in the 27th year.</p>
<h3>Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Chen Dongyuan, Discusses How to Choose Departments and Schools (Part 5)</h3>
<p>Two Standards for Choosing a School: The School Itself and Personal Convenience</p>
<p>School Standards</p>
<p>Choosing a school should not be based solely on the school's reputation. The first section already discussed this, because the reputation of a school, which is often highly regarded, is often insufficient to represent the true quality of the school, let alone to indicate whether it suits your needs. So how should you choose a school? I think there are two standards:</p>
<p>(1) The standard of the school itself. Each school has its own advantages. It is absolutely impossible for everything to be good. Therefore, when choosing a school, you should see which departments are good. The way to see is nothing more than several aspects: 1. Equipment, 2. Talent, 3. Student atmosphere, 4. Performance of graduates in society. Within a school, some departments may have good standards, while others may not. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is a pity that there is still no special book describing the situation of various departments in universities across the country for young people to refer to when applying to schools. However, based on my personal knowledge and experience, I might as well mention a few examples. For example, the Faculty of Arts is excellent at Southwest Associated University, Sun Yat-sen University, and Zhejiang University. The Faculty of Science is excellent at National Central University, Southwest Associated University, and Yenching University. The Faculty of Law is excellent at Wuhan University, National Central University, and Soochow University. The Faculty of Agriculture is excellent at National Central University, Private University of Nanking, and Lingnan University. The Faculty of Engineering is excellent at Tangshan Engineering College, Wuhan University, and National Central University. The Faculty of Commerce is excellent at Private Fudan University and Shanghai College of Commerce. The Faculty of Medicine is excellent at National Central University, Tongji University, and Northwest United University. The Teachers College is excellent at National Teachers College, National Central University, Zhejiang University, Northwest United University, and Sun Yat-sen University.  The Department of Management is excellent at National Chiao Tung University. All of the above examples inevitably have omissions. However, they are just examples. In detail, each department within each faculty has its own advantages and disadvantages due to the differences in faculty and talent. In short, when you choose a school, you should observe the equipment, faculty and talent, student atmosphere, and the contribution of graduates to society in various departments in order to obtain a more reliable standard.</p>
<p>(2) The standard of personal convenience. As mentioned earlier, each school has its advantages. Therefore, when choosing a school, we cannot only use the advantages and disadvantages of the school itself as a standard. Whether the school is convenient for the individual is also an important condition. For example, 1. Is the area where the school is located too far from home? 2. Can my personal financial ability afford the fees required by the school? 3. Do I have other relationships with the school, such as my father or brother working at the school, or friends and teachers who graduated from the school? These are all issues worth considering. Especially at present, when transportation is difficult, if the school you enter is too far from where you live, it will be quite difficult to get to the school after being admitted, so you should pay more attention to the area where the school is located. This year's unified enrollment requires filling in three choices when registering. The Ministry of Education has promulgated four principles for distribution after passing the examination and being admitted. The first article says, "Admitted freshmen will be distributed according to their first choice, regardless of the examination area, and in order of academic performance." According to this article, you can fill in your ideal school and department that you have chosen as your first choice. Then, whoever has better test scores can be assigned to the school they have chosen, which completely depends on academic performance. Candidates from Guangdong can be assigned to Shaanxi, and candidates from Chongqing can be assigned to Kunming. This is also the intention of unified enrollment. The second article says, "When the school of the first choice is full, the departments of the second and third choices will be assigned to colleges and universities in the examination area or nearby areas, still in order of academic performance." According to this article, when you fill in the second and third choices, you should focus on the departments that match your personal choices. As for the schools you fill in, you might as well fill in the schools in the examination area or nearby areas, because if you cannot be admitted according to your first choice in the future, you can only be assigned to the examination area or nearby areas. This matter is related to the actual application during registration, so it is specifically attached for discussion.  (End)</p>
<h3>YMCA Subsidizes Students' Finances</h3>
<p>Registration starts from the 7th to the 12th</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge and the YWCA at Jing'an Temple Road, in view of the fact that outstanding middle and high school students in this city are unable to continue their studies due to war damage, and have dropped out of school halfway, which is a pity, have organized a student relief committee to consider the situation and subsidize tuition fees, or living expenses, or travel expenses, so that they can continue their studies. The qualifications are limited to students in schools above the junior college level and senior high school students, regardless of religion or gender. The subsidy for university students will not exceed 50 yuan in national currency per person, and the subsidy for middle school students will not exceed 30 yuan per person. The application method is that the applicant fills out an application form to the association and submits it together with the required documents. Then the association will carefully check the items filled in. On the one hand, in order to encourage students to pay attention to common sense and current affairs, all applicants must be given a common sense and current affairs test by the association. After the association deems it qualified, it will issue a notice of payment. The registration date has been set for August 7th to 12th, from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm, and from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, at the student department of the two associations, which is truly good news for poor students.</p>
<h3>Education Community Prepares to Celebrate the First Teachers' Day</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Public Organizations Clarify Their Position in Telegrams to British and American Authorities - Telegrams to Roosevelt Urge Continued Sanctions Against Aggression - Urge British Prime Minister to Take Effective Action</h3>
<p>Yesterday, major public organizations in Shanghai sent telegrams to US President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain, expressing their respect for the US abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the British declaration of no change in its policy towards China, and the British-Japanese Tokyo negotiations, and explaining China's solemn position, requesting that effective methods be taken to sanction aggression. The original telegrams are translated below:</p>
<p>Telegrams to the US President Express Respect</p>
<p>To President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull in Washington: We are deeply impressed by your resolute abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which shows the demeanor and sincerity of great statesmen upholding justice. This move will not only safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the United States, but also make a significant contribution to the restoration of the international rule of law and moral order. Our 450 million people all look forward to your continued leadership in sanctioning aggressors by the most effective means, so that humanitarianism and world justice can be promoted. We are infinitely hopeful.</p>
<p>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Call for Suspension</p>
<p>To Prime Minister Chamberlain in London: The people of our country have learned that Your Excellency declared in Congress a few days ago that there would be no change in the policy towards China. We deeply admire this and send a telegram to reaffirm our confidence in Your Excellency's leadership of world politics and continued assistance to our country. The policy of appeasement in the Far East can only succeed if it actively confronts aggression with a fixed and strong policy and jointly takes necessary actions with all democratic countries related to the Far East. Therefore, we respectfully request that you immediately suspend the Tokyo negotiations and sincerely use the most effective methods, such as abolishing the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and prohibiting the export of military materials to Japan, to sanction aggressors, so that Britain's Far Eastern interests can be maintained and world peace and international justice can be restored. We are infinitely hopeful.</p>
<h3>Extension of the Western Section of the Longhai Railway</h3>

<h3>Terrorists Released by Italian Army - Found to be "Avenue" Employees - Often Handed Over to the Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that the armed terrorists who caused a great disturbance at Cao Yi Elementary School at No. 1081 Jiesfeier Road yesterday (3rd) morning were released by the Italian army to the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters in the afternoon and immediately returned to Cao Yi Elementary School, expelled the faculty and staff, and occupied the building that was once the headquarters of the Caojiadu Security Corps. It is believed that these terrorists are members of the so-called "Chinese Nationalist Party Anti-Communist Special Agent Group" organized by the Wang faction. It is heard that these people intend to turn the house into another agency. After the terrorists were released by the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters yesterday afternoon, ten of them, each with a hand grenade and a military Mauser pistol, but no longer holding large knives, returned to Cao Yi Elementary School, which caused the faculty and staff to immediately withdraw and then occupied it. Occasionally, one or two people patrol outside, but they are no longer interfered with by Italian patrol soldiers. According to official sources, 16 terrorists were disarmed and taken to the Italian military headquarters yesterday morning, and then handed over to the Japanese authorities because they were employees of the "Avenue" and were arrested in the Japanese-controlled area.</p>
<h3>Preparing for the Anniversary of the Shanghai War and Defense - Police Conduct Alarm Drills - Two Alarms Issued in Less Than an Hour - All Detectives and Police Officers Mobilized with Exceptional Speed</h3>
<p>Obstacles Added Outside the Western District</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports that the police stations of the Public Concession Police Department were preparing last night (3rd) for the upcoming anniversaries of 8/8 to 8/13. At 5:45 PM, a practice alarm was issued to each police station, and the police stations responded and set out. However, just after the teams returned to the police station after the assembly test, at 6:40 PM, the General Police Station issued a general alarm, ordering the search for three cars. A team of 30 people from the Lao Zha Police Station rushed to the Zhejiang Road Bridge to search cars coming from the north bank of the Suzhou River.</p>
<p>All vehicles were searched.</p>
<p>The drivers of the vehicles were brought into the Lao Zha Police Station, detained for about 20 minutes, and released after explaining to the police station that they were not one of the people being searched by the police station. A patrol team from the Putuo Road Police Station patrolled Robert Sheng Road and the surrounding area yesterday, searching pedestrians and arresting 30 suspects. The patrol ended at midnight. It is heard that the roads along the border of the western district have</p>
<p>Erected Obstacles</p>
<p>French Concession patrols were also busy searching pedestrians at the intersection of Haig Road and Xiafei Road. The precautionary measures and mobilization plan had not been fully determined last night. Officers from the foreign defense forces of the two concessions will hold a meeting today (4th) to formulate a plan. It is heard that from August 8th to 16th, all police personnel will have their leave canceled, and the hand-held machine guns normally maintained by the reserve team have been distributed to each police station to prepare for any terrorist incidents.</p>
<p>Also, the Mainland News reports that the Public Concession Police Department heard rumors yesterday afternoon that some</p>
<p>thugs</p>
<p>had crossed into the Public Concession from "Bad Land" and intended to carry out shooting atrocities again in the newspaper concentration area of 爱多亚路. Therefore, the reserve police were sent to the Jing'an Temple Road area to conduct a rapid search of cars, trams, and buses. At the same time, patrolmen erected obstacles along the roads outside the border in the western district to prevent other thugs from entering the Public Concession. Until late yesterday, many obstacles remained, which indicated that they would be removed only after the</p>
<p>Two-Week Anniversary</p>
<p>of the outbreak of the Shanghai War on 8/13. As a result of the police department's rapid action, traffic along Jing'an Temple Road was blocked, and the search team strictly blocked every car coming from the western district. The French Concession police authorities cooperated with the Public Concession and began a wide search of pedestrians and vehicles in the newspaper concentration area of 爱多亚路 from around 5:00 PM, which lasted until after 10:00 PM. Various</p>
<p>rumors</p>
<p>were rife in the newspaper concentration area, some saying that nine cars carrying terrorists had set out from "Bad Land" and driven into the city to attack the newspapers. Whether this statement was based on fact may never be known. If it were true, it would be due to the fact that the mobs were startled by the sudden police precautions taken. The police department admitted that there were a few thugs in the Public Concession, so the search was carried out. It is heard that some of these thugs were the mobs who had several clashes with Italian soldiers on Jiesfeier Road yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>British and French Passenger Liners to Arrive in Port this Afternoon</h3>

In March of this year, he left Shanghai to go abroad to Singapore, Makassar, Surabaya, Batavia, Deli Medan, and the British Islands to investigate the domestic goods industry. During this period, the domestic goods manufacturers in this city relied on Mr. Pan's efforts to transport a large amount of goods to that area. It is now heard that Mr. Pan has completed his investigation and departed from Hong Kong on the President Doumer, and will arrive in Shanghai today. After hearing the news, the manufacturers have elected representatives to go to the pier to welcome him. At that time, Mr. Pan will make great contributions to the domestic goods manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Mountain Torrent Outburst: Guizhou-Vietnam Railway Traffic Interrupted; Passengers Must Disembark, Transfer, and Re-board Trains; Goods Piling Up at Haiphong, Shipments Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Hanoi-Dong Dang Traffic Hindered</p>
<p>According to someone who recently returned to Shanghai from Haiphong, the Guizhou-Vietnam Railway between Hanoi and Dong Dang has recently been disrupted again by mountain torrents. The amount of roadbed that has been washed away reaches as much as eleven kilometers. Therefore, passengers traveling that section must take boats and rickshaws for part of the journey and then transfer to trains to reach their final destinations. Due to the aforementioned obstruction, there are restrictions on luggage; each person is only allowed to carry thirty kilograms to be transported by the railway bureau. Furthermore, the highway between Hanoi and Dong Dang is also impassable, currently suspended due to flooding.</p>
<p>Goods Stockpiling Again at Haiphong</p>
<p>Currently, Haiphong is regarded as the only transshipment port for goods transported from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places to the interior. Consequently, imported goods at Haiphong often experience unsorted accumulation. In March and April of this year, there was a period when goods piled up excessively, making storage temporarily impossible, so imports were restricted. Later, through vigorous efforts to clear the backlog, increasing vehicles, and constructing warehouses, the situation eased. Now, a letter from Haiphong reports that warehouses, customs storehouses, and nearby open spaces are all full of goods, making further stockpiling impossible. Moreover, with the rainy season approaching, even open spaces cannot be used for storing goods. There have been cases where entire ships of goods, after arriving at Haiphong, have been unable to unload and have been returned to their ports of origin. Therefore, all transportation agencies have temporarily suspended accepting goods for transport to Haiphong.</p>
<h3>A Certain Party, Under the Guise of Recruiting Workers, Deceives Workers into Going to Qingdao, Imprisons and Trains Them, Forcing Them to Fight Elsewhere; Two Workers Escape to Shanghai, Recounting Their Deception</h3>
<p>The Daguang News Agency reports that previously, it was reported that a certain party instigated ruffians to secretly come to Shanghai under the pretense of recruiting workers to load and unload goods, but in reality, all were forcibly taken to Qingdao, imprisoned, and trained. Yesterday, a reporter from the Daguang News Agency met two coolie workers, Zhu Xuechang and Qian Wenchang, who had just escaped from Qingdao, who described their experience of being deceived in detail. According to them, "We two originally lived in a shantytown in the western district of the concession. Last week, we met</p>
<p>a person we didn't know,</p>
<p>who said that the wages we earned doing work in Shanghai, just a few dimes a day, were insufficient to maintain our lives. It would be best to go with him (the person referred to himself) to do seawall work outside Wusongkou. We could get a settlement allowance of two yuan at the time, and afterwards, we could get wages of one yuan and fifty cents a day. We two were deceived by the lure of profit, so the next morning, led by the person, along with many</p>
<p>recruited workers</p>
<p>and us two, we first took a barge from the Bund to Pudong, then a small steamer to outside Wusongkou. We were immediately forced onto a transport ship of a certain party and driven into a corner under the deck. After three days, the ship loaded more than a thousand Chinese people and sailed directly to Qingdao. We landed at a wharf with an unknown name and were escorted to various warehouses along the coast, where we were trained every day, with beatings at every turn.</p>
<p>Suffering Extensively Described</p>
<p>The warehouse doors were all fitted with iron bars, under very strict surveillance, exerting maximum pressure. After we were lured in and trained, the workers secretly told us that after three months, we would be sent to fight. Those who were successively sent off were numerous. Hearing this,</p>
<p>we shuddered with fear.</p>
<p>So we feigned illness, and during our isolation, we took the opportunity to break through the fence and escape to a foreign ship for help. With the permission of the Westerners, they secretly brought the two of us back to Shanghai." They were filled with sobs. It has also been learned that regarding the above situation, the Japanese concession is still very active in recruiting workers through deception. It is hoped that all sectors will inform the workers not to fall into the trap again.</p>

<h3>British Missionaries in Occupied Areas Have Suffered Significant Oppression; Many Missionaries in the Interior Have Withdrawn Under Threat; The Chinese People Generally Do Not Sympathize with Anti-British Sentiments</h3>
<p>The *China Press* reports that the anti-British movement launched by the Japanese in all occupied areas of China is rampant, and its attention has now turned to British missionaries, who are now often subjected to pressure from the Japanese authorities. In recent weeks, Shanghai has received several reports of British missionaries being evicted from their properties and mistreated. However, so far, due to postal disruptions and traffic obstructions, there is little reliable information describing the truth in the occupied areas. Yesterday (the 3rd), according to staff from the China Inland Mission and the British Baptist Mission speaking to reporters, regarding the recent anti-British actions in the mission areas, although they did not have much information, they did know for certain that missionaries in the interior had withdrawn from their properties under threat, and other movements to expel Central Church missionaries in the occupied areas were in full swing. Properties of the China</p>
<p>Inland Mission affected by this movement include Linfen and Hongdong in Shanxi, where all British personnel have withdrawn. British personnel in Kaifeng, Henan, have also withdrawn, and the properties were subsequently sealed by the local police authorities. As a result of this action by the Japanese in Kaifeng, more than one hundred patients in the church hospital were forced to leave the hospital, many of whom had just undergone surgery and were in critical condition. It is believed that they did not find other places of refuge to accommodate these patients. British personnel of the British Baptist Mission</p>
<p>who withdrew under intimidation include those in Taiyuan, Xinzhou, and Daizhou (transliteration). Most of the missionaries who withdrew have gone to Beidaihe. There is no definite report yet, but it is believed that the property has not been damaged. According to reports from Linfen, church properties there were damaged by Koreans disguised as Chinese and "Manchus," but there is no news of the extent of the damage reaching Shanghai. The properties in Kaifeng and Hongdong are believed to be undamaged. An official from the China Inland Mission stated that the Chinese are indifferent to the Japanese's anti-British movement.</p>
<p>News received in Shanghai has proven that the Japanese themselves are carrying out all the incitement with the help of transferred people, "Manchus," and a few local ruffians. It is heard that there is a similar anti-British movement in the Changzhi area of Shanxi, where there is a sauce factory. There is an urgent desire to receive some news from that location. Another group of missionaries expelled by the Japanese army are stranded in Shijiazhuang due to flooding. It is not known whether they belong to the China Inland Mission. The official reiterated that the Chinese people do not sympathize with the anti-British movement, saying that after the uproar in Hongdong, the local</p>
<p>Chinese delegation apologized to the church and refuted the Japanese claims of general animosity towards the British in the area. Since the British are not allowed to enter Kaifeng or reside there, the China Inland Mission sent two American personnel to Kaifeng to take care of the property. The two are expected to be responsible for continuing the work, allowing them to serve in the hospital. Although the British in Shanxi have been subjected to harsh treatment, there are still a few missionaries in the southern part of the province. It is not yet known whether they are suffering significant oppression. The official believes that the anti-British uproar is limited to</p>
<p>large cities tightly controlled by the Japanese. Elsewhere, the Chinese treat the British as usual. The British in Kaifeng withdrew from their properties because of the deadline to leave the country. There was a demonstration by a crowd of twenty or thirty people in the church compound, funded by the Japanese with two or three dimes. The missionary wanted to stay in the area to do medical work to save the number of patients in critical condition, but was forced to leave, it is said.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Personal Small Packages to Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Due to traffic congestion and transportation difficulties, the shipping of large and small parcels from Shanghai to Xi'an, Lanzhou, Guangxi Province, and other places was temporarily suspended. After the Shanghai Postal Administration's Transportation Section made repeated efforts, shipping of large and small parcels to the above-mentioned places has resumed. Except for large-volume commercial parcels, which are still temporarily suspended, personal small packages and small packages of medicine have been resumed. However, they must be genuine personal parcels, and commercial goods must not be mixed in. Each item is limited to two kilograms. Detailed regulations for fees to be charged are in place.</p>
<h3>Japanese Bombardment of Pudong Proves the Activity of Chinese Troops; Rumor of Chinese Troops Attacking Japanese Troops in Chuansha and Nanhui; Japanese Warships Opened Fire for an Hour</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around three o'clock, there was a sudden burst of artillery fire from the Shanghai East area, faintly audible in the concessions. In the Yangshupu and Pingliang Road areas, it was clearly heard. Residents were awakened from their sleep in great terror, believing that guerrillas were attacking Shanghai. Around four o'clock at dawn, the artillery fire gradually subsided. After investigation, it was found that the artillery fire came from Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Wusongkou. It is heard that, given the increasingly active guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai, and the frequent attacks by the Chinese side on Pudong, Nanhui, Chuansha, and other places, the Japanese warships fired artillery at Pudong yesterday morning in an attempt to threaten the guerrillas active in Pudong and other places. Moreover, recently, Japanese warships have been frequently shining searchlights towards Pudong and Zhabei in the middle of the night. Due to the sudden tightening of Japanese defenses, it is evident that the guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai are indeed quite active.</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that from 3:00 to 4:30 this morning (the 12th), someone heard Japanese warships heavily bombarding Pudong near Wusong, which confirms the Chinese reports of guerrilla attacks on Japanese garrisons in the Chuansha and Nanhui districts. It is heard that Chinese mobile troops outside the walls of Nanhui City are extremely active, sending small teams to the suburbs to lure the Japanese, while large teams ambush the Japanese troops who come to attack.</p>
<h3>After Maintenance by the Exchange Equalization Fund, National Foreign Exchange Stabilizes; Foreign Exchange is Supplied as Much as Possible for the Import of Essential Goods; Black Market Foreign Exchange in Occupied Areas is Difficult to Eliminate</h3>
<p>After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee maintained the national foreign exchange with all its strength, it finally stabilized. The legal price has not changed. Essential goods are supplied as much as possible. After the international trade was adjusted, the foreign exchange fund became more substantial. However, it is difficult to eliminate black market foreign exchange. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>After Maintenance, Foreign Exchange Stabilizes</p>
<p>Since the success of the £10 million loan from the British Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Mercantile Bank, and the Chinese Bank of Communications and the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, it has made every effort to maintain the legal price of foreign exchange. The price of foreign exchange in all parts of the country, except for the occupied areas, has always been stable: (1) British exchange, one shilling and two and a half pence; (2) US exchange, thirty US dollars; (3) French exchange, one thousand and eighty French francs; (4) German exchange, seventy-five marks; (5) Hong Kong exchange, ninety-five Hong Kong dollars. Regarding the occupied areas of Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., there is the so-called black market for foreign exchange, where the price of foreign exchange is quite different from the legal price, about three-quarters lower.</p>
<p>Essential Goods Supplied as Much as Possible</p>
<p>All imported goods operated by importers that are not on the list of prohibited imports and are necessary for the country can apply to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee to purchase foreign exchange, which is handled by the Chinese Bank of Communications and the Bank of China. However, applicants must pay a balancing fee based on the difference between the legal price and the posted price of the two banks. However, if imported goods are imported through the occupied customs, they will not be eligible to apply for legal foreign exchange. Therefore, there is no establishment of a Foreign Exchange Review Committee in Shanghai, and the Chinese Bank of Communications and the Bank of China do not have posted prices. The Central Bank only publishes the legal foreign exchange price on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Black Market Foreign Exchange Difficult to Eliminate</p>
<p>The so-called black market foreign exchange in Shanghai is beyond the reach of the government and difficult to suppress. The Jianghai Customs, after being robbed, cannot implement measures to prohibit the import of goods and the settlement of foreign exchange for the export of local goods to collect the difference. Therefore, luxury goods and non-essential goods can still be imported through the Jianghai Customs. The purchase of foreign exchange for these goods has to rely on the Shanghai foreign exchange black market. Therefore, it is difficult to reduce the foreign exchange in the black market in practice. However, in order to prevent prohibited goods from being mixed into the interior, the re-export and mailing to non-occupied areas have been prohibited.</p>
<p>Adjusting Trade to Replenish Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>After the adjustment of international trade, the export of major local products such as tea, tung oil, bristles, and minerals has increased sharply, and foreign exchange has been sold to the government. The import of non-essential goods has been prohibited by government order, so China's foreign exchange fund is increasingly substantial. In addition, remittances from overseas Chinese have increased sharply after the war, as well as (1) cultural undertakings fees from various countries to China, (2) berthing and repair fees for foreign ships, (3) expenses for foreign warships and stationing in China, (4) expenses for foreign embassies in China, and (5) expenses for foreigners traveling in China, are all intangible income for China, which can offset part of the trade deficit.</p>
<p>Tightening of the Black Market Benefits China</p>
<p>The depreciation of the value of the legal currency in the Shanghai black market is actually the result of speculation by criminals, but it has no great impact on China's legal currency policy, and it will not cause any loss to the international credit of China's finances. Moreover, from the perspective of international trade, it is beneficial to China. As foreign currency prices rise, the prices of imported goods increase. The first to suffer are foreign merchants, while China can create national thrift and reduce the trade deficit. Therefore, the Chinese government has no reason to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange black market. Therefore, it is heard that the Exchange Equalization Committee will allow the Shanghai black market foreign exchange to take its natural course.</p>
<p>Suppressing Speculation to Stabilize Society</p>
<p>The main forces behind the fluctuations in black market foreign exchange are (1) the exchange market, (2) the foreign currency banknote market, and (3) the gold market. The maintenance of the exchange market is mainly by banks, the foreign currency banknote trading market is mainly by Qianzhuang, and the gold market is mainly by Qianzhuang and silver shops. Now, Chinese and foreign financial authorities will strictly review the types of transactions to avoid arbitrage speculation, such as restricting the supply of black market foreign exchange and stopping foreign exchange swaps, in order to avoid excessive fluctuations in the exchange market, causing market chaos and social unrest among the people.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Rampage Along the Coast Without Significant Value; Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Shaohong's Report; Determines that Japan No Longer Has the Strength to Expand its Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Huang Shaohong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, recently reported on the recent situation in Zhejiang Province and future response policies at a joint memorial week for party and government agencies, stating that the Japanese's harassment in various coastal areas of Zhejiang Province is part of the Japanese's overall policy, not a local action. The occupation of parts of Dinghai and Yuhuan counties has no significant value from a military point of view; the purpose is harassment. Regarding the overall war situation, Huang determined that the Japanese no longer have the strength to expand their occupied areas. Future response policies: (1) Strengthen political power to ensure military victory, strive to stabilize society, and cultivate local forces for long-term combat; (2) Strive for self-reliance and break the blockade plan. A. Strengthen international awareness and eliminate dependence; B. Strive for self-sufficiency and do not rely on external forces; (3) Implement political austerity and save waste. A. Strive to save on external things, and manage gasoline and kerosene; B. Study substitutes, and try to substitute everything that can be substituted; C. Improve technology and step up production; (4) Find new sources of tax revenue and establish a new financial foundation, implement public management and exclusive sales of various enterprises.</p>

<h3>Fire Insurance Issues Worth Studying: Shenxin Factory Sues Three Insurance Companies; Whether it is a State of War is the Focus of the Dispute</h3>
<p>Rong Buren, the legal representative of Shenxin Textile General Company, recently hired lawyers Lu Congzu and He Baiqian to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court against Ding Xuetong, the legal representative of Taiping Insurance Company on Jiangxi Road, Guo Fuyun, the legal representative of China Insurance Company on Sichuan Road, and Wang Renquan, the legal representative of China Tianyi Insurance Company on Beijing Road, seeking compensation for fire insurance losses. The gist of the lawsuit is that the plaintiff company has Shenxin No. 7 Factory located at 468 Yangshupu Road in this city, with an attached warehouse, the building of which is a four-story Western-style warehouse, storing cotton and cotton cloth, underwritten by the defendant insurance companies, etc., with</p>
<p>fire insurance.</p>
<p>The warehouse is divided into eight warehouses, identified with numbers. Only Warehouse No. 3 and Warehouse No. 5 suffered losses due to the fire. Taiping jointly insured 900,000 yuan for Warehouse No. 3, and China jointly insured 400,000 yuan. The goods in Warehouse No. 5 were insured for 320,000 yuan by Taiping and 50,000 yuan by China Tianyi. The fire occurred on December 10, 1937, in the plaintiff's warehouse, causing severe damage to the goods in Warehouse No. 3 and Warehouse No. 5. Therefore, the plaintiff made a request to the defendants. If they could not agree on the submitted loss list, then, according to Article 18 of the insurance contract,</p>
<p>submit to arbitration.</p>
<p>Until August 22 of last year, the defendants still refused to select an arbitrator. The attitude of the defendants actually hindered the plaintiff's progress, because the contractual clause stipulated that no lawsuit could be filed without prior arbitration, so it was necessary to submit to arbitration first. Therefore, the legal counsel of the plaintiff selected accountant Li as the sole arbitrator. After careful investigation, the judgment result was that the amount of fire loss for Warehouse No. 3 was 329,736.20 yuan, and for Warehouse No. 5, it was 191,314.65 yuan. Based on the judgment result, the plaintiff entrusted Paget &amp; Co. at No. 12 Huangpu Beach Road, Shanghai, to calculate the above</p>
<p>loss amount</p>
<p>and the amount to be apportioned by each defendant company and foreign insurance company under each insurance contract. On April 14 this year, Paget &amp; Co. replied to the plaintiff's legal counsel with the calculated amount. According to its calculation, the first defendant, Taiping Insurance Company, should be responsible for paying 356,982.50 yuan, the second defendant, China Insurance Company, should be responsible for paying 91,273.13 yuan, and the third defendant, China Tianyi Insurance Company, should be responsible for paying 20,985.42 yuan, totaling 469,241.05 yuan. The plaintiff made this</p>
<p>apportionment calculation</p>
<p>to the defendants, requesting payment of the full amount, but was refused. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed, requesting a legal judgment for compensation, and bearing the litigation costs. It is also requested that a provisional execution be declared for this judgment, etc. After receiving the summons, the defendant Taiping, China, Tianyi, and other insurance companies also separately hired lawyers E Sen and Liu Shifang to file a defense, stating that the plaintiff's lawsuit against the defendants for compensation is based on the fire insurance contract signed by both parties. However, Article 6 of the contract stipulates that the insurer is not liable for losses occurring during the term of the contract under extraordinary circumstances. However, if the insured can prove that the cause of the damage has</p>
<p>absolutely no relation to the existence of extraordinary circumstances,</p>
<p>the insurer shall be liable for compensation. The last item of the same article also stipulates that the burden of proof in this case shall be borne by the insured. The location of the insured property in this case is the cotton and cotton cloth in the warehouse at No. 468 Yangshupu Road in the eastern district of the Public Concession, and the fire occurred on the morning of December 10, 1937. Since August 13, the area has been a base for Japanese military operations and is still under occupation and siege today. This is an obvious fact. Now, the plaintiff cannot prove that the defendants have no obligation to compensate in principle. The plaintiff misunderstood</p>
<p>the meaning of the insurance contract,</p>
<p>arbitrated, and requested compensation based on the amount obtained from illegal arbitration, which is unreasonable and should be rejected, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji heard the case. In addition to stating the reasons for the lawsuit, the plaintiffs' attorneys Lu Congzu and He Baiqian stated that our national army withdrew from the north on October 27, 1937, and from the south city and Pudong area on November 11 and 12. The Shenxin warehouse caught fire at 8:00 AM on December 10, which was more than 40 days after the withdrawal of the national army. There was no state of war in the area. As for the</p>
<p>cause of the fire,</p>
<p>the plaintiff certainly does not know, but it was absolutely not destroyed by artillery fire or airplane bombs. Moreover, there is one most important point, that is, the 50,000 yuan insurance policy of Taiping Insurance Company was only issued on November 26, 1937, just over ten days before the fire. Having issued the policy, it should be liable for compensation. They also submitted the Municipal Council Gazette and the report of the Fire Brigade to prove that the fire was on the morning of November 10. However, the defendants' attorneys, E Sen and Liu Shifang, still used extraordinary circumstances as a reason for defense. Judge Xu instructed that the case be rescheduled for review.</p>
<p>Driver Commits Homicide Due to Negligence</p>
<p>Wang Jincai, a driver of the public bus company from Funing, was driving public bus No. 15042 east on Shandong Road on the morning of the 28th of last month when the brakes failed, killing pedestrian Hua Xiangsheng. After investigation by the police, he was prosecuted for negligent homicide. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen concluded the trial and ordered the defendant to pay 1,000 yuan bail and await sentencing.</p>
<h3>Ma Ruqi Arrested and Released After Rescue Efforts; Japanese Lightly Believe the Words of a Witch and Make Indiscriminate Arrests; Said to Be Related to the Murder Case of the Yongyuan Boss</h3>
<p>Zhang Amao (also known as Kang Meinian, 31 years old), the boss of the Shuiyuan gambling den at No. 6 Anlefang, at the intersection of Route des Soeurs and Route Cardinal Foch in western Shanghai, was shot and killed at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dufeng Road at 8:40 PM on the 28th of last month. The murderer is at large. The details were reported in this newspaper. Until the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 3rd), Ma Ruqi, a local merchant residing at No. 31, Lane 598, Route Bayle, French Concession, was at the Dasheng Club in Xinkangli, Caojiadu, western Shanghai,</p>
<p>talking with friends,</p>
<p>when a Japanese man claiming to be from the Entertainment Venue Supervision Office suddenly came, claiming that in the Zhang Kangmei assassination case, someone had reported that Ma was a major suspect and had come to arrest him. At that time, someone explained to him, but the Japanese man threatened him. Ma had no choice but to go with the Japanese man. After hearing the news, Ma's relatives and friends tried every means to intercede, and he was not released until yesterday morning. However, after investigation, Ma's</p>
<p>reason for being arrested</p>
<p>is said to be that a witch (commonly known as a fairy), who likes gambling, is a customer of the Yongyuan gambling den. The day before yesterday (the 2nd), the witch came to Yongyuan to gamble heavily. In the midst of her gambling excitement, the witch suddenly changed her normal state and claimed that she was possessed by a wronged ghost, and that the wronged ghost was Zhang Kangmei, who had been shot and killed, shouting that the murderer was Xiao Wang (Xiao Wang was the co-founder of Yongyuan gambling den with Zhang Kangmei and is now on the run). She further claimed that the day before Zhang was killed, Xiao Wang had been at Ma Ruqi's home</p>
<p>plotting with Ma.</p>
<p>At that time, Zhang's family was present and, upon hearing this, lightly believed the above-mentioned ghost story and secretly reported it to the Japanese, and the Japanese immediately used the witch's words as evidence to arrest Ma. This is truly an interesting story amidst the rampant arrests in this city, and it is similar to the ancient King Li's use of witches to monitor and slander people and arbitrarily harm the people.</p>
<p>According to the Huawen News Agency, at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 3rd), the booth of Yongfang, an upper store in the Dasheng gambling den in Xinkangli, Caojiadu, western Shanghai, was finished and being taken over by Ma Shigan,</p>
<p>when suddenly several plainclothes personnel from a certain party came, approached Ma, and ordered him to go with them. Ma, seeing the situation was bad, quickly explained that he had no enemies recently, that he was a law-abiding person, and had not done anything out of line, but the plainclothes personnel were impatient and</p>
<p>slapped the bodyguard standing next to the gambling table. Their momentum was fierce. When the two sides were at a stalemate, Wang Wenbo, the manager of the gambling den, knew it was inevitable, so he</p>
<p>stepped forward</p>
<p>and advised Ma that it would be better to go with them and that he was willing to go along. Ma agreed and went out to the door. The plainclothes personnel immediately forced Ma into a car that had been waiting and sped westward. Wang Wenbo was left outside the door and did not go with them. It is heard that this case was led by Zhang, but the reason is unknown.</p>
<h3>Head of the Xianyue Dance Hall Arrested for Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Sheng Yong, from Ningbo, lived at No. 3, Lane Tong'an, Route Kaimier, French Concession. He was the manager of the dancers (commonly known as the head of the dancers) at the Xianyue Dance Hall run by Xie Baosheng on Jing'an Temple Road. However, Xie Baosheng recently discovered that Sheng Yong had embezzled 350.49 yuan since April of this year and fled. He reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, and Hua Detective Ye Yushan arrested Sheng at the Dadong Billiard Room the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Wang Yaotang prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Code. After interrogation by Judge Xiao, he was ordered to be returned to custody pending further investigation and a seven-day adjournment for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Dancer Disappearance - Accusations of Abduction by Male Patron - Chen Weiling Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>Chen Weiling, a native of Wuxi and an employee of Dachong Company at No. 8, Lane 197, Seymour Road, was an avid frequenter of dance halls, rarely missing an evening. He became intimately acquainted with Lin Shuzhen, an eighteen-year-old dancer from the Shanghai Dance Hall on Wuma Road. As extreme affection often turns to resentment, their relationship was marked by frequent ups and downs, a situation her mother was powerless to control. One afternoon at 3:30 PM, the pair had another argument at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road. Initially, they were whispering sweet nothings and holding hands, but soon they were hurling insults at each other, as if irreconcilable enemies. Suddenly, after the quarrel, Lin Shuzhen vanished. Her mother, unwilling to lose this cash cow from her grasp, reported the incident to the Lao Zha gate police station, accusing Chen Weiling of abduction and requesting an investigation. The police chief dispatched Chinese Detective Sun Dafa, along with a Western detective, to the Dachong Company, where they detained Chen. Yesterday morning, Chen was brought before the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian briefly outlined the case, stating that Lin Shuzhen had indeed been abducted by Chen and that a detailed investigation was necessary. He requested that Chen remain in custody pending a full investigation. Judge Xiao then questioned the defendant, but Chen denied the charges and retained lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang for his defense. Ultimately, the court, citing the ongoing investigation, granted the police's request to keep Chen in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Deposit Dispute - Both Sides Hold Conflicting Accounts</h3>
<p>Chu Shuncai, a native of Wuxi in his thirties, runs the Taifeng Fur and Bone Shop at No. 73, Moller Street in the French Concession. Recently, Xi Benchu, a native of Jiangyin, through his lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, Criminal Division, accusing Chu Shuncai of embezzling a deposit of 3,500 yuan. The case was heard yesterday in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The plaintiff, Xi Benchu, was represented by his lawyer, who presented the following</p>
<p>Plaintiff's Claim</p>
<p>The plaintiff formerly owned the Xixi Store on Wuding Road in the International Settlement. On December 2nd of last year, he deposited 5,000 yuan in cash with the defendant, Chu Shuncai, who issued a deposit book with the stipulation that the money could be withdrawn after three days. The deposit book was witnessed by Li Rongsheng and Zhu Shunxiang, among others. However, the defendant only paid the plaintiff 1,500 yuan, leaving 3,500 yuan unpaid. The defendant then</p>
<p>Published a Notice</p>
<p>in the newspapers, stating that the 2,000 yuan deposit book issued to Xi Liben had been fully paid and was now void. While Xi Liben is not the plaintiff, the defendant's intention was to manipulate the plaintiff and attempt to embezzle the 3,500 yuan deposit. Therefore, the plaintiff seeks to have the defendant arrested and brought to justice. Defense lawyer Pan Zhensheng, representing Chu Shuncai, replied that the defendant was unable to attend court due to illness. He stated that the facts of the case were not as presented by the plaintiff's lawyer. The defendant previously operated the Hengfeng Shipping Company, which owned the Huadong steamboat. The boat was hijacked at Yanglinkou, and two</p>
<p>Passengers Were Kidnapped</p>
<p>(a businessman and an interpreter). Through Wang Tingzheng's efforts, they were ransomed for 12,000 yuan. An initial payment of 10,000 yuan was made, and for the remaining 2,000 yuan, the defendant, Chu Shuncai, issued a deposit book as a guarantee of payment. The defendant subsequently paid 1,500 yuan in cash, and the remaining 500 yuan was issued as a check. However, because the check could not be fully cashed, the plaintiff, Xi Benchu, filed a criminal lawsuit.

<h3>Apprentice Factory Worker - Fraudulently Cashes Check - Sentenced to One Year and Six Months</h3>
<p>Fan Benxi, an apprentice from Chongming at the Renhexiang Cloth Factory at No. 3, Lane 657, Ningbo Road, International Settlement, took a check from the factory the day before yesterday afternoon and cashed it for 1,250 yuan at the Futai Exchange. The exchange had previous dealings with Renhexiang and noticed that the seal on Fan's check did not match those of the past. They notified the factory owner, Guo Fucheng, who, after a detailed examination, confirmed it was a forgery. He reported it to the Lao Zha gate police station, which dispatched Detective Xu Fusheng and a Western detective to Futai, where they arrested Fan. They found three blank checks on his person and took them back to the police station for investigation. According to Fan's confession, he was instigated by Yin Zengrong, a native of Changzhou who managed the factory's labor accounts. Yin first stole the key to the silver box and then stole four blank checks from inside the box. Yin then filled in the amounts and had Fan cash them at Futai. Yin Zengrong was also arrested, but he denied the instigation. Yesterday morning, they were brought before the First Special District Court, where Judge Xiao conducted the trial. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the case, and Guo Fucheng brought three large and small seals from Renhexiang to the court, proving the defendant's theft. The court questioned Fan Benxi, who confirmed that Yin was indeed the instigator. Yin claimed that Fan was falsely accusing him. Judge Xiao reviewed the evidence and determined that there was insufficient evidence against Yin Zengrong and acquitted him in court. Fan Benxi was sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment as a warning to others.</p>

<h3>The Saving for Disaster Relief Society Announces that Saving Ghosts is Not as Good as Saving People</h3>
<p>The City Saving for Disaster Relief Committee announced the diversion of Daoist ritual expenses to relieve refugees in an announcement that reads: The country is in trouble, and people are suffering. Everything that can be saved should be conserved as much as possible. Moreover, holding Daoist rituals for ghosts is a superstitious activity. As the saying goes, "If you cannot serve the living, how can you serve the dead? If you do not know life, how can you know death?" At this time when saving people is not enough and survival is difficult, how can we devote our great spirit and precious materials to appeasing ghosts? Mr. Jin Zongcheng, chairman of the Xin Xin Company, previously proposed diverting Daoist ritual expenses to relieve refugees. His benevolent words and good deeds are worthy of admiration. We also ask all hometown associations, guilds, institutions, organizations, and residents of each alleyway in this city to use their real hearts and efforts to eliminate the bad habit of holding Daoist rituals, divert the shared expenses, save for disaster relief, and send them to the various banks in the city at any time, to be credited to the account of this association. Accumulating small amounts into large amounts, and universally saving the afflicted, will be a hundred thousand times more blessed than saving ghosts.</p>

<h3>Finance - What Relationship Do New Banknotes Have to the Present - The Foreign Exchange Market Has Another Buying Spree</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: The HSBC listing did not fluctuate. In the black market for British and American currencies, the price started to increase due to the purchase of oil companies such as Texaco Asia, Asiatic, and others such as Hesheng Xinfeng, as well as Japanese banks. In addition, HSBC only agreed to maintain the price of British gold at four pence three one two five in the morning, leading to a tight trend in the market. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the Ministry of Finance was printing new banknotes in England, which led to the mistaken belief that it was related to finance and the idea of capital flight. In fact, this large batch of banknotes is still being printed and cannot be completed in a short period of time. It is possible that it will be used for post-war reorganization and reconstruction. How is it related to the present? This started a speculative trend, and panic and buying increased. Chinese and Western speculators and foreign companies scrambled to settle, and HSBC was willing to sell, which made the market tighter. As a result, the market closed at four pence one nine six eight seven five for British gold and eight yuan three one two five for US exchange. The August futures also followed the same trend, ultimately with British gold tighter by one two five and US exchange softer by two five. The day's trading was still active.</p>

After the opening, foreign companies such as Xinfeng and Hesheng came to buy and settle. First, foreign banks settled spot British gold at four pence three seven five, and then bought and settled spot US exchange at eight yuan five six two five from a certain bank. As a result, the process was slightly soft. When the HSBC listing was announced, it remained unchanged. After the announcement of the silver balance tax, it was still exempt from taxation. After that, Japanese banks also bought spot British gold at four pence three seven five from foreign banks, and spot US exchange at eight yuan five six two five. At the same time, foreign banks mutually made spot British gold at four pence four zero six two five, so the condition was still level. Around 10:00 AM, oil companies frequently came to buy and settle, and HSBC's willingness to sell was weak, which made the market continue to tighten. Texaco settled spot US exchange at eight yuan half from a certain bank, and then Asiatic also bought spot British gold at four pence three four three seven five from foreign banks such as Huabi. Soon, it also bought spot British gold from HSBC at only four pence three one two five. At the same time, the spot US exchange from the bank was also returned at eight yuan four three seven five. Later, a certain bank stuffed a certain amount of this month's US exchange at eight yuan zero six two five and spot US exchange at eight yuan five three one two five to a peer bank. Until the midday close, the bank's spot selling price was four pence three seven five for British gold and eight yuan half for US exchange, which was higher by 0.03125 for British gold and softer by 0.09375 for US exchange compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Tightened Sharply</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, a Western merchant, Sassoon, first settled spot British gold at four pence three four three seven five from a foreign bank. At that time, a rumor suddenly spread in the market that the Ministry of Finance would add new banknotes, which led to foreign companies and Chinese merchants scrambling to buy and settle, so the condition became even tighter. Foreign companies and Chinese merchants successively settled spot British gold at four pence three one two five from foreign banks, and spot US exchange at eight yuan three seven five. Later, the Chinese merchants also bought this month's US exchange at eight yuan zero six two five and eight yuan from Datong Bank. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was four pence two nine six eight seven five for British gold and eight yuan three one two five for US exchange, and four pence one two five for British gold and eight yuan for US exchange for this month.

Because wealthy locals and Hong Kong merchants absorbed a considerable amount, and floating investors also followed suit, the price rose to $3,675. After 10 AM, as the number of buyers gradually decreased, general speculators took the opportunity to profit from the high price and sell, causing the price to fall back to a low of $3,620, the opening price in the morning. At noon, due to the upward trend and retail investors buying at low prices, the price rose again to between $3,650 and $3,660. The afternoon trend became even tighter, as rumors suddenly spread in the market that the Ministry of Finance was printing new banknotes abroad, causing foreign exchange to continue to tighten. Buyers were eager to buy, dragging and taking advantage, becoming increasingly excited. The price broke through the $3,700 mark, reaching a high of $3,710.

Although a certain "Ling" firm (representing speculators) and securities firms took profits on their overnight long positions, and silver shops also slightly sold to hedge, the market remained firm due to the continued tightening of foreign exchange and sellers raising prices. Soon, the price soared by $55. Cash gold shops bought ten taels from a certain gold shop, and money exchange businesses bought fifty taels from securities firms, both at $3,675.

Before long, the price fell back by $55. Securities firms sold twenty taels to silver shops at $3,620. Around 11 AM, due to news that foreign exchange was trending tighter again, and a certain gold shop stopped selling and started buying, coupled with a certain money exchange business acting as an agent for wealthy individuals to absorb the gold, and Hong Kong merchants also becoming active, the upward trend resumed, soaring by $45. Money exchange businesses bought ten taels from silver shops at $3,665.

<p>The local Xiangmao Foreign Firm announced that (1) the Beradin Rubber Estate Ltd. had decided at a board meeting yesterday to pay an interim dividend for the year, starting from the 18th of this month, at $0.15 per share. (2) Kansa-Mitr Rubber Co., Ltd. also decided at a board meeting to pay an interim dividend for the year, starting from the 23rd of this month, at $0.07 per share. (3) To-Mi-Ren Rubber Co., Ltd. also decided at a board meeting to pay an interim dividend for the year, starting from the 18th of this month, at $0.15 per share.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton: Chinese and Japanese Factories Actively Purchasing, Cotton Trade Develops, Cotton Merchants Sell Out All Scheduled Cargo</h3>
<p>Both domestic and foreign cotton yarn and raw cotton transactions are showing improvement. Chinese and Japanese factories are both showing appetite, hence the market is flourishing. This cotton is all cargo that was previously ordered by the same industry. Foreign telegrams have been received, and both coarse and fine cotton have been loaded onto ships heading to the Far East. They will arrive in Shanghai soon. Cotton merchants, avoiding having to raise funds to pay for the goods upon arrival, took advantage of the factories' activity and sold everything at market price, which was much cheaper than the prices quoted by foreign firms. The factories were also happy to get cheap goods, and the cargo trade became very active. The total number of transactions today was 4,500 bales. Chinese factories purchased 1,850 bales, Japanese factories purchased 200 bales, and the rest were traded among the industry. It is said that most of them were resold to foreign factories. The source from Northern Jiangsu included 55 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The current situation of raw cotton is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>According to another report, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have been brisker recently due to looser credit. Japanese factories have low inventories, and the selling price of goods in the hands of the same industry is also more than 20 dollars cheaper than the prices quoted by foreign firms. Therefore, Japanese factories are buying aggressively, and the inventory of the industry is almost exhausted. As inventory decreases, the selling price increases, becoming equal to the prices quoted by foreign firms.</p>
<p>Indian cotton is continuously arriving. It is reported that the British company's regular ship "Carthage," which arrived in Shanghai today from London, carried 457 bales of cotton from Bombay. It docked at Pudong Qichang Warehouse at 5 PM for unloading. Also, the company's "Shirala" ship, managed by Apcar and Company, carried 2,900 bales of cotton from Calcutta. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 6th) at 4 PM and will also dock at Pudong Qichang Warehouse for unloading.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: When the New York cotton market opened, prices were weak due to reports of declines from Liverpool and Bombay, falling 5 to 8 points. Speculators took profits after the US cotton export subsidy was announced, and hedging activities were triggered. Reports on cotton-growing weather are increasingly favorable. According to private estimates, this year's cotton production will be around 11.5 million bales. Later, new buyers entered the market, and prices rose slightly, resulting in an increase of 1 to 2 points compared to the closing price on the 10th. Indian transport is predicted to rise by more than half a rupee, and Egyptian is predicted to rise by 7 to 8 points.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Dumping of Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth in China Shakes Up the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The price trend of cotton yarn is downward and extremely weak. At the same time, sales to out-of-town merchants are becoming increasingly sluggish. This is because the amount of goods purchased in the past few days has been very large, and demand is temporarily saturated. There may be a period of rest and digestion before further purchases are made. The buying and selling among the same industry is also not as crowded as before, and the activity has slowed down. The market situation has reached a stable state. However, some people still believe that factories do not intend to open yarn, and raw cotton is expensive, so they are still leaning towards a bullish position.</p>
<p>The industry was mostly watching at the beginning of the current yarn session. Out-of-town merchants were also not buying yarn. Mobile brokers were hawking goods in the market and entrusted sales were numerous. It was also heard that Japanese yarn fell 10 dollars at the opening, and the selling cries were particularly loud. The opening price fell by 5 dollars. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn from foreign godowns was 583 dollars, and the price of godown receipts was 570 dollars. At this time, the situation was mediocre. After a while, it was heard that gold had risen slightly, and buying interest increased, rising again by 3-4 dollars. The current price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 587 dollars, and the price of godown receipts was 573 dollars. Afterwards, transactions were not very smooth. By the time of closing, it had fallen by a small amount of 2-3 dollars. In short, the yarn market is still in a state of flux. It was found that the total number of transactions in half a day was 970 bales, and the total number of transactions in the afternoon of the previous day was 250 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 3 dollars, and the closing price fell by 3 dollars. The price of Five Sons fell by 5 dollars. Today, 110 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, and 220 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each trade group is listed as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market experienced significant ups and downs. The opening was shaken by reports that Japan was shipping large quantities of cotton yarn and cloth to North and Central China. The price of 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month's delivery suddenly fell by 10 dollars, to 450 dollars. It then rebounded to 456-458 dollars as those who had profited covered their positions. The closing price was only slightly lower than the previous day's price by 2 dollars.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Prices Slightly Stable</h3>
<p>Domi: A small steamer from the Songjiang trade group brought eight boats. From Jing to the Chelin Baozi Nan trade group, there were 1,600 to 1,700 bags. Confidence waned, and the market was exceptionally quiet. There were also few transactions outside the market. Therefore, the prices of thick japonica and other goods outside the market have decreased by about half a dollar, opening at around 23 dollars. The price of high-grade top-quality rice opened at 18.5 to 18 dollars. As for transactions in the market, there were still no samples available for both japonica and top-quality old rice. Only open transactions were done at 16 dollars, rough top-quality rice at 15 dollars, and variable rice at 22 dollars. In terms of appearance, it also fell by 3 to 4 jiao. It is estimated that there were more than 4,000 bags traded inside and outside the market. In short, although the market is chaotic, people are somewhat concerned. Therefore, as soon as the situation eases, everyone watches and waits. If the market remains sluggish today, then the downward trend will be sharp, no less than the upward trend.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Yesterday morning, after a period of tension, merchants sold at a high price to profit and reduce hoarding. The market immediately loosened. Although there is still no definite news about the opening of production areas, confidence has slightly returned to normal. Selling prices in both the open and black markets were lower by one to two jiao. However, those within the 16-dollar limit are still considered rough. It is said that machine-milled rice is still different by one, two, or three dollars.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday, it was still in the process of being rejected.</p>
<p>Sellers had raised prices by more than one dollar, but although import demand was greedy, it was ultimately too expensive and no transaction was made.</p>
<h3>Flour Soars: Five Dollars and Twenty Cents for Spot Cash on this Street, Six Dollars and Twenty Cents for Out-of-Town Merchant Remittances</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the price of spot flour rose again. The factories were very firm. Therefore, the wholesale price on this street in the morning had been changed to 5 dollars and 1 jiao in cash, an increase of 1 jiao compared to the previous day. It was heard that the price would increase by another 1 jiao in the future. Out-of-town merchants continued to request remittance and the factory also agreed to sell remittances at 6 dollars and 2 jiao. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, there was a distinction between cash and remittance prices for both local and out-of-town merchants. The total number of transactions in the market for all brands of flour was more than 50,000 bags. Apart from more than 10,000 bags sold to local and inland merchants for retail sales, the rest were all purchased by out-of-town merchants.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the source of wheat was continuous and the sales were active. Fuxin and Fufeng factories continued to purchase more. The route for hoarders on this street was also not declining. Furthermore, as flour prices soared, those holding goods were all trying to raise prices. The market rose again by 1 to 2 jiao. A total of 20 carts of wheat from Kunshan, Wuxi, Danyang, Nanjing, Qishuyan, Suzhou, Benniu, etc., were sold in the market, at prices ranging from 6 dollars and 7 jiao to 7 dollars and 5 fen. Apart from 13 carts purchased jointly by Fuxin and Fufeng factories, the rest were all purchased by merchants on this street.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake: Oil Prices Soar, Dalian Opening Not Realized, Soybean Oil Soars by 1 Dollar and 9 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market experienced another wave of turmoil. The rumored opening of Dalian in August turned out to be a bubble, causing people to become excited and speculation to become active. Furthermore, today was the Changjiang Rinyin, and the number of transactions increased dramatically. Soybean oil soared by 1 dollar and 8-9 jiao in one day. However, as the source of boxed oil was continuous, the market was stable, only rising by 3-4 jiao yesterday. It is estimated that 150 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded, with the price rising from 46 dollars to 47 dollars and 1 jiao. 400 barrels of Kobe-Lian oil were traded, with the price rising from 46 dollars and 5 jiao to 47 dollars and 8 jiao. 50 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded at 47 dollars and 5 jiao. 400 cans of Tianjin canned oil were traded at 44 dollars to 44 dollars and 6 jiao. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou boxed oil were traded at 34 dollars. 250 pieces of Qingqi oil were traded at 34 dollars and 4 jiao. 300 pieces of Yanqi oil were traded at 34 dollars and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>On the 5th, 80 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong. On the 4th, 2,000 cans of tung oil were shipped from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Weak</h3>
<p>According to foreign reports on yesterday's sugar market, Dutch sugar for September fell slightly to 6.5 guilders. London sugar rose slightly, with December at 6 shillings and 0.25 pence, March of next year at 6 shillings and 1 pence, and June at 6 shillings and 1.5 pence. The local Chamber of Commerce's listed prices for 24 coarse white sugar, spot goods, and re-export goods remained unchanged. Taikoo Car White continued to fall, with Dongzhan B mark at 37 dollars, Xizhan at 37 dollars and 5 jiao, small triangle CW mark at 37 dollars and 3 jiao less 1 jiao, CX mark unchanged at 37 dollars, DY mark at 36 dollars and 5 jiao, and HX mark at 36 dollars and 3 jiao less 3 jiao. Dutch red spot goods were 3 jiao less at 28 dollars and 3 jiao, and re-export goods were 1 jiao less at 21 dollars and 7 jiao. Local cotton white and local ice remained at the original price. Domestic sugar transactions did not take place because the recent clearing has been sparse and the August 13th period is approaching, so merchants do not intend to be greedy.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: New Zhangzhou Branches Appear</h3>
<p>The first batch of Orchid Bamboo branches and Bird Leaf branches produced in Zhangzhou was shipped to Shanghai the day before yesterday, totaling more than 400 boxes. The harvest was still good. However, transportation from Zhangzhou to Gulangyu is extremely inconvenient due to occasional obstructions from a certain party. With even a slight lack of caution, there is a danger of being confiscated. Therefore, those engaged in this business have some concerns, so it seems difficult for the source to be too prosperous. However, as new Guangdong branches cannot be exported, and Zhangzhou branches can be shipped to Shanghai, they are expected to have a superior advantage.</p>
<h3>Orchid Bamboo Branches Sell for $80</h3>
<p>After the first batch of orchid bamboo branches arrived in Shanghai, it was heard that the goods had already been released. As the cost is high, merchants do not seek high profits. Yesterday, selected orchid bamboo branches were sold for $80, and the remaining early red bird leaves were returned.</p>
<h3>Metals: Original Silk and Round Nails Both Rise</h3>
<p>The trading of Japanese round nails has been very lively. Tianjin traders have been absorbing large quantities, and building traders and hoarders on this street have also been showing a good appetite, resulting in factories not having enough goods to allocate. The price of original silk and coiled steel (both raw materials for round nails) has risen by 4-5 dollars in recent days. The current market price is 26 dollars, and the price of original silk is 17 dollars. Therefore, the price of round nails has also been driven higher, selling at 27 dollars per barrel, only 1 dollar higher than its raw material (coiled steel). Therefore, some manufacturers are considering suspending operations, and confidence in the market is strong.</p>
<h3>Gardenia Rises by $8-9</h3>
<p>Gardenia, in addition to supplying medicinal materials, can also be used as a pigment for all kinds of beverages, so sales are quite good. As Shantou and Jinjiang transportation have been successively blocked, the source has been cut off. The city's inventory is also limited. Yesterday, merchants on this street purchased more than ten pieces, and the selling price rose by 8-9 dollars compared to the past.</p>
<h3>Galangal Almost Reaches a Full Market</h3>
<p>The source of galangal has been cut off, and the existing stock is gradually decreasing. Recently, due to the discount rate, confidence has strengthened. Therefore, merchants have tightened their prices and have not sold. It is heard that traders have been showing a strong intention to buy in recent days. The two sides are in negotiations, and the high bid is currently 40 dollars, and it is expected to reach a full market soon.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Briquette Factories Need Hongji Shavings</h3>
<p>The source of Hongji white coal shavings is not abundant, and the digestion of various coal briquette factories is strong, resulting in the market supply not meeting demand. Furthermore, the general small factories are indirectly ordering goods in a panic. Therefore, the over-the-counter market is quite brisk. The price of Hongji No. 1 shavings has already reached 45 dollars per ton, and the price of No. 2 shavings is 38 dollars. Additional labor is added to the Yangjingbang dock to load cars.</p>
<h3>Statistics: The Advancing Cost of Living: Food and Housing Prices Rise Endlessly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette published the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Cost of Living Index for July of the 18th year of the Republic. Since the beginning of this year, prices have soared and the cost of living index has increased dramatically. The July index reached 188.56, an increase of 12.41 points from the previous month, an increase of 7.05 percent. Compared with the index for the same month last year and the base year (the 25th year of the Republic), it is 20.98 and 88.56 percent higher, respectively. As the cost of living rises, the purchasing power of money decreases accordingly. One yuan in the 25th year of the Republic is now equivalent to 5 jiao 3 fen and 0.3 li.</p>
<p>Classification indexes are also trending upward. The food index increased by 9.56 percent compared to the previous month, fuel increased by 5.58 percent, miscellaneous items increased by 0.46 percent, clothing was generally stable, slightly decreasing by 0.07 percent, and rent increased by 4.67 percent compared to the first half of this year.

<h3>Miscellaneous Talk on Literary Creation</h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>As Mr. Bai Ying said, in the publishing industry over the past year, translations have surpassed general creative works, creating a "prosperous" phenomenon. The translations he listed are naturally not limited to literary works, but include all translations related to economics, law, society, as well as biographies or travelogues.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is certainly gratifying on the one hand, as using other people's cultural food to heal our hunger is not only urgently needed at the moment, but may also be used as a reference in the future. However, on the other hand, it is too pitiful that our own creation is so poor.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the factor that causes the "prosperity" of translations is the harsh and difficult environment, which hinders creation: Although creators have excellent materials, writing may not be a problem for the time being in today's world where chapters have not been eliminated, but publication will be a problem. Before the "July 7th" Incident, many progressive writers often "closed their mouths" in order to be in line with the national policy at the time and could not express the living reality in their writing. After Mao Dun's "Midnight" was cut off, why didn't translations start to roll up a climax? "Dead Souls," "Mirgorod," and "Outlaws of the Marsh" were all products of that period. The difficulties in the environment of the special region now are ten times greater than in the past. Creators have no better way than to "treasure" the materials. This is the reason for the silence and lack of vitality of creation.</p>
<p>However, having said that, in the Chinese literary world, and only in terms of literature and art, creation has always been very pitiful. Works that can fully express a strong social consciousness and become masterpieces of flesh and blood, such as Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" and Mao Dun's "Midnight," are actually few and far between. What is the reason for this? In my personal feeling, writers seem to underestimate reality, or simply rely on subjectivity and "close the door to build a car," resulting in the content falling into emptiness. Even if writing skills reach the highest point, it is at best a step towards "art for art's sake," turning literature and art into decorations. Even worse, unnamed writers are kicked out. Editors and publishers form an iron blockade line, making unnamed writers with creative aspirations feel hopeless, and finally retreat in the face of difficulty. Therefore, in these remote twenty-odd years since the "May Fourth" Movement, we have rarely read great literary works. If there are any, they are only the few works such as "The True Story of Ah Q" and "Midnight." This irreparable loss can only be left to history to bear the responsibility.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Bai Ying's proposed issue of material processing and theme organization is also worth paying attention to. Having good materials but lacking processing methods, or having good themes but lacking organizational skills, will not produce successful works. As with Pearl Buck's "The Patriot," Chinese literary and art writers can naturally write, and there is no shortage of such materials. However, the problem with some writers is not that they are not good at processing, but that they use their ears instead of their eyes. The success of a scientist is based on experimentation. If literary and artistic creators can write works of flesh and blood, I believe that in addition to processing materials, they should also collect materials from reality and not allow any ideal components to seep into the works. As for the attitude of writing, we must always take not distorting reality as the main condition.</p>
<p>There have been too many materials available for writing in the past two years. After the barriers are removed in the future, I hope that epoch-making works will be produced.</p>
<h3>In the Communication Trench</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>——A Wartime Comforting Journal</p>
<p>In the height of summer, the intense sunlight blazed across the fields; the universe was silent, stifling, without a trace of sound. Willow branches, thorns, green grass, and wisteria all drooped, dry and shriveled.</p>
<p>On the prairie, we carried heavy loads of comfort goods, moving forward. After passing Yue Long Bang, we turned into the winding communication trench, our pace quickening, sweat dripping onto the dry, hot trench floor, leaving faint damp marks.</p>
<p>Looking out from the prairie, we saw a faint gray smoke rising. As we walked, we hummed the tune of "The Motherland March," remotely echoing the sound of gunfire in the sky.</p>
<p>"Sha...sha sha sha...sha..." Suddenly, a rushing sound swept overhead. Then, less than twenty yards behind us, a shell landed, the soil flying into the sky, a rapidly rising thick smoke condensing high in the air.</p>
<p>No one paid attention to the shell exploding, continuing to stride forward.</p>
<p>After turning past a field, another shell fell not far ahead, damaging the trench surface, the soil collapsing, emitting the smell of gunpowder.</p>
<p>"This is somewhat like a big black bear sighing sideways," a comrade joked with a laugh.</p>
<p>"Get to work, get to work, do it yourselves..." everyone shouted. But when we ran over, ready to start, we found four engineers already at the site, wielding shovels, clearing the pile of mud in the trench. We walked over in surprise, shook their hands, gave them a string of bananas, and continued on our way.</p>
<p>After walking some distance, looking back, the trench surface had been restored to its original state, and the four engineers had suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>A talkative comrade then opened the floodgates of conversation: On the front lines, one must be quick in action, calm in demeanor, resolute, and composed. They have the instinct to waste bullets, but we have the skill to repair at any time. Shells close to us are useless; will distant ones be effective? They won't cause much damage..."</p>
<p>His words were interrupted by another loud "thump" sound. He looked ahead, opened his mouth, and smiled, saying, "Here it comes again, let's just keep walking, and let it be."</p>
<p>Walking, talking, and laughing, our lips again blew out the tune of "Blood Wash the Rivers and Mountains." The surrounding shell explosions, the faint shouts ahead, the whirring of airplane engines—these sounds became increasingly dense. The sun, the heat wave, the sweat, the thirst, all seemed to have flown out of our senses; the gunfire, the shells, the thick smoke, the warrior's blood flowing on the mud, were flashing and enticing us.</p>
<p>"The front is the trench of the second line of defense; beyond that is the front line. Maybe we'll have a chance to do something?" Captain Li said, raising his hand.</p>
<p>Although the shelling was intense, the trenches of the second line of defense were still quiet and peaceful; rows of soldiers lay prone in silence, gripping their guns; only the sound, like roaring sea waves and erupting volcanoes, coming from the smoke-filled front, banished the loneliness of space.</p>
<p>As we turned out of the communication trench entrance, a battalion commander ran over with several soldiers, humbly and respectfully relieving us of the burdens of the comfort goods, taking them on their shoulders, lightly and quickly, and walking together into the trench of the second line of defense.</p>

<p>Knowing oneself, understanding oneself is not easy; conquering oneself, overcoming oneself is even more difficult, if you cannot be true to yourself.</p>
<p>People are accustomed to seeing the splinter in another's eye, but not the beam in their own, as a religious classic says.</p>
<p>Criticizing others, pointing fingers at others, giving others a slap in the face; but, turning around, you slap yourself in the mouth, burning and painful, truly pitiful and laughable. People often lose the mirror that reflects their own souls, which is lamentable.</p>

<h3>On Makeup</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Having acted in a few plays myself, I deeply know the hardship of makeup. Especially in summer, a face full of greasepaint is more unbearable than being wrapped in heavy fur. But I am not against women wearing makeup. At least because when they wear makeup, the suffering is only theirs, and it has nothing to do with me. On stage, you have to wear makeup; if, contradicting Shakespeare's saying, life is acting, then the makeup of daily life is naturally not surprising.</p>
<p>"Hua" means to change, and "Zhuang" means to adorn. Wearing clothes and hats are also makeup. On stage, whatever role you play, you wear makeup according to the nature of the role; in the human world, if you are a scholar, you have the attire of a scholar. Artists deliberately keep their hair very long, which is not without effort or without considering it, but simply to suit their profession, to add makeup.</p>
<p>In the theater, watching characters act on stage, it is rare not to be deceived by the effect of makeup. Once a person's face is rendered, it naturally changes infinitely, transforming magically. But in all the world, how many people can see through the appearance of makeup and penetrate into the inner soul? Moreover, human intelligence is advancing daily; not only faces can be made up, but even souls and spirits can be made up. After the powder and rouge, no matter how sharp your eyes are, you will only be deceived. The progress of makeup techniques is also advancing daily; it is simply not only advancing daily, but even advancing like a whirlwind.</p>
<p>In the world, the darker the heart, the whiter the face. This is a certain principle. Skin is rough, so a lot of moisturizing cream must be applied; hair is white, and to appear young, it must be dyed black. There is also the logic of dyeing black hair that is not black, and applying yellow powder to yellow skin. The arguments of traitors can also be disguised as bright and grand, and swindlers never wear the mask of a swindler. The scoundrel who is usually the target of public criticism is actually far less bad than others think the good person is. The more brilliant the makeup skills, the deeper the degree of cunning; this is a universal truth, but unfortunately, many people are deceived.</p>
<p>There was a famous beggar in Europe, dressed in tattered clothes, covered in festering sores, old, and extremely pitiful. During the day, he sat on the sidewalk, begging in a sorrowful voice, and most passersby casually threw down a penny or two. But at night, this beggar lived in a mansion, living luxuriously, dressed in gorgeous clothes, not old at all, and without sores; he was just begging and swindling money by means of makeup.</p>
<p>Such things are everywhere, not only swindling money, but also seizing fame, swindling power, swindling faith, and even swindling the country and the masses, all of which are implemented in the human world under the makeup of attitudes, psychology, faces, behaviors, and language.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, who can not wear makeup?</p>
<p>In the sweltering heat, women's faces must feel uncomfortable. I am not against the use of greasepaint. If personality and character are wrapped in red and white greasepaint, then what is there to say about the skin of the face?</p>

<h3>Impressions of the Wilderness</h3>
<p>— Li Ren</p>
<p>After the Sino-French Drama Society's performance of "The True Story of Ah Q" received rave reviews, they followed up with "The Wilderness."</p>
<p>This is a tragedy. Although the plot is simple, the handling is quite difficult.</p>
<p>The story is like this: Chou Hu, whose father was killed by Jiao Yanwang and who was framed and imprisoned for eight years, escapes from prison to seek revenge. But Jiao Yanwang has already died, leaving behind only his son, Daxing, and Daxing's blind mother. Daxing has a second wife, Jinzi, who was formerly Chou Hu's lover. When she sees Chou Hu this time, she is pleasantly surprised. However, Daxing's blind mother learns of this. She tells her son Daxing to report the fugitive. Chou Hu then kills Daxing; she wants to take revenge but mistakenly kills her grandson. Chou Hu and Jinzi flee into the wilderness and are surrounded by the local detectives. They commit suicide by slitting their throats.</p>
<p>The director is Shu Shi, who also plays the male lead, Chou Hu. He is an experienced actor. Overall, he is satisfying, but in some places, his spirit is not very focused, and he seems a little lax. Zhou Manhua plays Jinzi. Her lines are fluent and loud, and her movements and expressions are deeply moving. She is the one who leaves the deepest impression on the audience. Qiao Qi's Daxing is better in the second half than in the first. The first half is a little dull, which does not create unity. Meng Na's Jiao Shi is very capable of portraying a fierce, stubborn, and narrow-minded old woman. She is consistent from beginning to end, which is not easy to do.</p>
<p>The other actors are also competent.</p>
<p>The sound effects and set design all coordinate with the development of the plot, such as the roar of the wind, the chirping of two turtle doves. All can make the audience deeply appreciate the plot. The sets are all good, but only scenes two and three seem too cramped and crowded. It would be best to move the chair in the middle of the stage to the empty left side, and the small table next to the shrine could also be removed, which might make it more harmonious.</p>

<h3>Memories and Thoughts on Acting (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Leng Fang</p>
<p>——A Conversation with Ms. Tan Ying</p>
<p>This film was only a guest appearance at the time. Later, when Lianhua Film Company was founded, they invited me to sign a long-term contract for three years. Only then did I leave school life and formally step into the film industry. However, I have been living this life in a confused way for eight years, and I feel ashamed to think that I have accomplished nothing!</p>
<p>My thoughts on acting: I think an actor's life should be complex, with a lot of stimulation, so that they can laugh and cry often and be experienced, so that they can act wonderfully and with strength. If they live in luxury, living in high-rise buildings and growing white and fat, without any experience of life, it is impossible for them to act well for the rest of their lives. In addition, if an actress wants to make money solely by selling youth, then her life will naturally be very short and difficult to last. But true performing arts are eternal, because as they get older, they can play older roles. If they don't know they are old when they are old, then they will truly become old monsters and inevitably isolate themselves from the audience. Now, I am only twenty-five years old, but my heart is as still as water, and I feel very old. For example, in the recent film "Lust Demon," I played a naive and innocent little girl with braids. Although the director said that I played the role well, I was only forced to do so, and I always felt very embarrassed.</p>
<p>Art is eternal! I want to work harder on this. But the future is uncertain, and it is not easy to predict. I believe that one can only rely on one's own ability to strive forward. As for the results of the struggle, that is another question that does not need much thought.</p>
<p>Dance World Sketches (34)</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3>Star Six Star Chronicle Six — Rong Feifei</h3>
<p>Anyone who travels around the metropolis has probably seen a dance star called Fang Lili. Her dance skills are no less than Jin Lili's, and her social skills are also good. She left for Hong Kong last week. When she left, many of her fellow sisters went to the ship to see her off. One of them, Fang Lili, even hugged her and cried loudly, even more sadly than a blood relative, which surprised the other people who were seeing her off. Do you know the reason? A disciple asked me, and I couldn't guess. A day later, she told me the truth. I am a straightforward person, so I won't let you suffer. Let me write it out quickly.</p>
<p>Before the August 13th Incident, Fang Lili met a close friend, and after a while, she inevitably became pregnant. Just at the moment when the war clouds were urgent, the little citizen in her womb was also eager to be born. Unexpectedly, the little citizen's father suddenly felt ashamed to be a father and refused to leave his house. When Fang Lili was a dancer, she only spent money as it came and went, and she had no savings. At that time, a production fee became a problem. She couldn't find her close friend, and the dance halls were closing one after another due to the impact of the situation. Her fellow sisters had no income from dance tickets and were all taking care of themselves, so naturally, they couldn't ask for loans. As the saying goes, heaven never bars one's way. Just when she was so anxious that she had no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth, suddenly a living benevolent Bodhisattva came down from Hui Mountain, took out some clothes and ornaments that she had saved, pawned them for two hundred yuan, and gave them all to her. She also comforted her and said, "The dance hall has opened. I borrowed this from the accounting room first. Later, when you dance, you can continue to receive money." Because of this, Fang Lili was able to get through the difficult time safely. You want to know where this living Bodhisattva lives and what her name is? Let me sing a few lines of opera lyrics for her: "Without opening her mouth, she smiles, respectfully listening to the details, her hometown is Rong Lane in Wuxi, Rong Feifei is the name of the servant; only because her family has suffered misfortune, she has therefore learned the art of being a dance star." Alas! In this era, this kind of enthusiastic and righteous friend is not easy to find. If you want to visit her, please go to Dahua Tea Dance once.</p>

<h3>Peach and Plum Tribulation</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>“BcCk Road To Heaven”</p>
<p>The playwright of "Peach and Plum Tribulation" raised such a valuable question: the evils caused by a bad environment and the tragedies caused by an irrational society. He placed sympathy and sighs on the young Frank, and left "whose fault is it" on the heart of every audience, making people think deeply.</p>
<p>The writing of the script was carefully considered. For example, on graduation day, the teacher ordered each student to show a skill to show their interest in seeking further study in the future, to contrast with Frank, who stole the harmonica and eventually committed a crime and went to jail. It should be an excellent educational film.</p>
<p>But this good script completely failed in its performance. First: the tone of the whole film is too slow, and the center of gravity is not deep enough, and it loses its power. For example, in the later development of each student after graduation, the director did not grasp the strong contrast that the playwright gave to the audience's hearts. Second: he did not concentrate all his efforts on Frank, clearly portraying his process of falling, but let the horizontal development destroy the sublimation of emotions. Third: the editing is chaotic, such as after Frank escapes from prison in the end, he also writes about the alumni meeting, and only after Frank has escaped far away does he connect a shot of a police car chasing him. The scene where Frank says goodbye to his classmates and teachers is indeed the most moving scene in this film, and the grasp of the mood and atmosphere is strong enough, but the carelessness of the editing reveals a conflict in time.</p>
<p>A mediocre director is a great loss to actors, and can also destroy a good script. The tragic failure of "Peach and Plum Tribulation" is a great pity.</p>
<h3>Brief Art News</h3>
<p>The Soviet film "Pugachev" is now showing at the Huiguang Grand Theater. The story of this film is tragic and the scenes are grand. It is said that ticket sales are very good.</p>
<p>The Yixing Amateur Drama Club will hold its first public performance on the 6th at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen Association. The scripts include "New Father", "Dawn", "In the Shikumen" and "Four College Students". The directors are Song Chao, Ma Ling, Chen Mingxun, etc.</p>
<h3>Mei Lin Leaves the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Bu Zhi</p>
<p>For two years, the film industry has lacked the activities of Mei Lin. No, judging from Mei Lin's current living environment, perhaps, perhaps her light-hearted smiling shadow will never be reflected on the screen again.</p>
<p>The reason is: Mei Lin wants to gradually dilute and even eliminate everything about her in the audience's minds because of certain problems and relationships. Summer has arrived, and now, the black cannon car is carrying Mei Lin flying along the wide Edward Road. With him protecting her, her spirit appears more radiant and happier than before. The thin material of her clothing, the new-style sanction of 1339, sets off her slender figure, and the sound of her high-heeled leather shoes is so crisp and loud.</p>
<p>Most people know that Mei Lin is Mei Lin, but they don't understand that Mei Lin's original surname and name is Pan Zhaolin. At that time, she changed her name because she was afraid that her parents would object to her entering the film industry. She is from Shanghai and used to study at Moore Hall English School. Mei Lin is beautiful, so when Ruan Lingyu passed away, she was given the nickname of Sai Ruan Lingyu. But Mei Lin's innocence is more likely to attract the attention of the audience than her beauty.</p>
