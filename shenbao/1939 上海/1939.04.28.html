<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐局與日本所徬徨</h3>
<p>本報昨刋路透社電，據稱英倫二報，有紀述如左：</p>
<p>泰晤士報東京電稱、日政府內部目前繼續不斷之考盧、甚關重要、何所適從、猶在未定之天、星期五日、希特勒在德國國會中無論作何鼓勵人心之語、然未必能謂日本願在太平洋中為軸心國作戰也、此種局勢，以及日內閣之前途、今皆甚微妙云、</p>
<p>每日捷報外交記者稱、義國外相齊亞諾本有往遊柏林之說、但何日起程、迄無消息、此殆為反共公的變為軍事盟的談判、業已破裂之象徵、據羅馬負責方面消息、齊亞諾現已取銷其列席德國國會聆聽希特勒演說之計劃、至日本之猶豫不決、則其海軍當局、見羅斯福總統集中美艦隊於太平洋之命令、有所忌憚也、但希特勒刻尙作最後之努力、欲使日政府改變態度云、</p>
<p>二報所紀述，錯雜縱橫。所涉至廣，所關尤遠。蓋橫斷整個世界問題之一面觀，亦毫釐千里，莫測究竟之一大謎也以。問題之嚴重複雜，殆非任何力量所得控制其演變，亦非任何智慧所得把握其前途。問題中人，其惟埋頭猛進，加强其大我，以求結果之較有利；不然，惟有靜觀事實之趨歸；若居今日而預卜休咎，必無是處。雖然，有得泛言之者；侵略者貪得無饜，終必遭遇抵抗而潰敗；日本必敗於遠東，德義必敗於歐陸，德義日本而沆瀣一氣，終必同歸毀滅；毀滅之遲速不易測，但蘇聯美國態度愈强，則反侵略陣綫制勝愈速。</p>
<p>謎之所以為謎，乃因問題之自始至終，將不知分為若干階段；每一階段，各有其若干歧途；途必有終而不知其所終，更不知其所終之形態。以最近之階段言之；德義在歐洲之作為，囊括鯨吞，得步進步，似無止境，乃以美國總統羅斯福之去電呼籲，驟見頓挫，形成歷史上之一階段；而今晚德國元首希特勒所將答復之者，實為繼往開來之表示，亦新階段之始也。新階段可能之開展方式極多；陽示拒絕和平建議，陰事停止侵略行為，假以時日，許以紆廻，於是而國際種種分贓議價之談判繼之，此方式一；虛相委蛇，競張實力，左顧右盼，因利乘便，賡續其巧取豪奪之生涯，此方式二；反脣相稽，劍拔弩張，圖窮七見，短兵相接，此方式三；三者其大較。若乃出入擒縱，游刃於時間空間，則可能之方式允多，不拘一格矣。惟此種種可能，亦即成為影響及於遠東之種種不同之前提；惟前提之不同，故無自而斷言日本究為劇中何角；况如英倫泰晤士報之報告，日本對此，根本上尙在繼續玫慮之中，而不知所適從。易辭申言之；德義進，日將與俱進乎，將尼之乎，抑將遠之乎？德義徘徊，日本將勵之乎，抑將阻之乎？德義主和，日本將主戰乎，將取為在遠東「下台」之機會乎，抑將對歐局主和，對遠東主戰乎？所謂和，和英美乎，和蘇聯乎，和中華民國乎，所謂戰，戰於印度洋乎，戰於太平洋乎，抑戰於東海濱州與貝加爾湖之間乎？日本所「不知適從」者，有若是焉。然則何得逆覩問題之所終。</p>
<p>曩嘗論之；德義軸心以反共為號召，引日本為伴侶；自日本侵略中國，遭遇抗戰，消耗其實力殆盡，德義當可恍然於無取乎此伴侶，日本亦必自知無所裨補於德義。如是云云，以彼所謂反共為之主題者也。時勢推移，彼所號召者愈偽，離主題者愈遠；於是德義所欲利用其伴侶者，亦別有所在；蓋事實上既不務反共，即不待夾擊蘇聯之歐亞兩端，而在稍稍裨補德義所絕對不足之海軍。誠以反共而攻蘇聯，雖大可鄙薄此躓於中國之跛友；顧在海上，則日本固當世三强之一。謂德國元首希特勒對日猶作最後努力者，非無故也。此在日本，詎不知之；彼積數十年心血所建之海軍，豈為備德義作工具？而日德義三國海軍之總積，既不足以當英法；歐洲各小國之左袒英法者，復各有其最低度之軍艦；然則日本海軍何為而戰所不可勝？况美國艦隊復眈視其後，得隨時拊其背耶？日本知之而猶徬徨不堅拒德義者，無他，中國有最後勝利之自信，而日人之至剛愎者，至今日而不復有制勝之自信矣；自陷愈深，自拔愈難，然有一念焉，以為歐洲動亂乃為日本自拔之機會，所猶豫不決者，究將如何預聞歐亂始得助彼自拔？倒行逆施，孤注一擲，安得自拔，徒以自速其亡而已。</p>

<p>（柏林）希特勒元首定于明日午間在衆議院發表演說、答覆美國總統羅斯福刪電、全世界各國現皆引領以待、德國人民又足引以自豪、據一般人推測、元首發言時、舉凡德國宣傳所慣用之各項論據、勢必一一提及之、例如德國舊有殖民地之被攘奪一也、協商各國業已違反美國故總統威爾遜十四項原則二也、希特勒兀首迭次提議限制軍備、各民治國均加以拒絕三也、各民治國與以破壞為事之鮑爾希維克主義相勾結四也、此外、元首或當努力說明德國凡與他國所簽訂之協定、均巳嚴格遵守、例如德國與敎廷所訂立之敎務條的、曁與波蘭國所訂立之互不侵犯協定、均當用以答覆外間對于德國違反慕尼黑協定兼併捷克之責言、此在政界人士則謂、元首未必發出驚人的表示、即英國決定實施徵兵制之舉、亦不致以影響加諸元首演詞、觀於本日午後各報均謂英國此舉、乃係虛聲恫嚇紙上談兵、可以見矣、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>張伯倫說明　兩案要點　授政府全權　以三年為期</h3>
<p>（倫敦）首相張伯倫今日在下院宣稱、吾人今實不得不感覺對於整軍經武、雖嘗作極大之努力、然能使世界感覺吾國抱有對侵略作堅毅抵抗之決心、莫如吾國之接受强迫軍役原則一事、</p>

<p>首相向下院說明政府所以實行徵兵制之理由、謂此制歐陸已普遍實行矣、志願制有一明白之弱點、即其人於貼鄰正專心受訓以備應戰之際、而猶專務尋樂或謀利是、在戰爭時代、軍役入手即將為强迫性質、此巳為一般人士了解而予接受矣、首相繼曰、余迄今以為在承平時代無實施此種計畫之必要、余嘗重申所予包爾溫勳爵（前首根）之諾言、即在此一國會之生活中、決不於承平時代提出强迫軍役是、吾人今未遭遇戰事、但在各國竭力集其所有資力以作戰備、維持和平之信念已被摧毀、人人皆知假使戰爭到臨、則吾人之加入戰爭必非數星期內而為數小時內之事件之時、無人敢謂今日猶為承平時代、而能適當用此名詞以稱之、按照議案規定、在不安靖之時期中、有召集某項志願軍及若干正規軍士員、以增强吾國防空制之必要、此極時期或尙將經過長久時日也、此將使志願軍之被召集者作較彼等應募時所料之史大而史長久之犧牲、政府已決定為應付新特殊狀况起見、目前有實施强迫軍訓之必要、余之云「目前」者、　余願切實聲明政府之建議、將包含於取名軍訓議案之第二議案中、而為暫時性質也、</p>
<p>首相繼謂兩議案所授予政府之權力將以三年為期、如情勢更變、得以閣會終止之、但在三年期滿時、亦能展長一年、惟須於兩院通過確定之決議案而後一司、（廿六日路透電）</p>

<h3>英實施强迫軍役　法國外交勝利　法美輿論表示滿意</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國政界今日對於英國實施徵兵制之決心、表示慶賀、並認此乃法總理達拉第外交上之勝利、法全國今日對於英方宜吿、為給予希特勒氏之眞實消息、深為慶幸、按達拉第於數日前、即堅持英國須實施徵兵、並與法國共同負責維持歐洲現狀、據此間軍事專家估計、若英國微兵制完成、則英法兩國當有軍力在一〇·〇〇）〇·〇〇〇左右云、（二十七日美聯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國內閣決定實施徵兵制之後法國負責人士、咸皆表示極大滿意、謂此乃英國歷史上空前創舉、邇來歐洲各國其主權獨立領土完整凡受有威脅者、已由英國自動接受的束為之保障、此决又決定實施徵兵制、於以見其履行的束之決心云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）「辯論報」標題曰「甚大之事件」、此可為法全國對於英相張伯倫宣布徵兵之典型的態度、「時報載稱、今日之決定與昨日之預算演詞、即意謂英國刻正將其道德與物質力之全部重量、置於天秤中以待試驗、俾應付大局、並忠實盡其國家與國際間之責任、德國如認英國微兵為挑釁、則將鑄一大錯、蓋德國已破壞條的之精神與文字、而重行國民軍杖也、）二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）英國決定實施徵兵制之後美國各界人士、無不表示滿意、咸謂軸心各國今後若果企圖用武力變更歐洲現狀、英國已決定以一切方法、加以反抗、此層可由該國實施徵兵制獲一明證、抑此舉乃係英國切實放棄「慕尼黑政策」之徵兆、英法兩國新近向歐洲各小國所提供之安全保障亦且因此而更為各小國所信任云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間對於英國實行微兵、均不加批評、大部分或將於得見英國選舉區與自治領如何反響後、始發評言、衆認張伯倫以目前非「承平時期為理由、辯明承平時期實行微兵之正當、無疑的將被視為與渠所保證各階級作同等犧牲之努力相背、近來美國各報切言英國有藉整軍與防空工作而作不正當之牟利者、美國國會今方以各種計畫、防杜「藉戰爭牟利」、並主張戰時當微發資金及人力、一般人士以為英人為求平等起見、將要求施行與美國相同之計畫、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>德報譏英　紙上談兵</h3>
<p>（柏林）英國政府決定實施徵兵制事、頃由此間各報加以評論、見解各殊、　相刺謬或謂英國此舉係屬暫時性質、能吾收效尙在未定之犬、或則目此為英國包圍政策之一部份、因而感覺不安、柏林波森日報載稱、「英國徵兵制之方式、僅有軍事專家感覺興趣、不値深論、但別有其政治上意義、此則張伯倫首相所作解釋、昌言不諱、換言之、英國實施微兵制、乃係外交上之工具、意在迫令各小國加入包圍政策、如是而已、」地方指導報載稱、「英國此舉乃係政治上一種行動、意欲煽惑各小國加入包圍政策、國際之隉杌不安、危機四伏、人心惟戰禍是懼、英國煽惑家固不能辭其責任」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）昨晚柏林各報咸有長篇記載、評論英國實施强迫兵役事、其言略謂、英國採取此項步驟之動機有二、一為欲在元首希特勒向國會發表演說之前夜、以壓力加之柏林、二為欲使歐洲各小國得一印象、以堅其對英國之信託、「柏林晚報」之言有謂、「包圍國」最近所採取之種種外交的與軍事的措施、並未予德國以若何深刻印象、德國嗣後仍當賡續推行其已定政策、「覓取德國不可或缺的生存空間」、對於反對軸心國家之策略在所不顧云、（二十七日海通電）</p>
<h3>羅馬深刻印象</h3>
<p>（羅馬）英相張伯倫所發關於徵兵之宣言、巳在義國政界人士發生重大心理上之影響、彼等認此事不啻英國政治中之「內部革命」、英國駐義代辦諾爾査理士、曾於今晨訪問義外相齊亞諾、吿以英國此項決定、因英國對於此項決定、在事前預示柏林及羅馬、故衆皆感覺甚大之滿意、軍界人士則認此項微兵計畫、為英法集團實力之大見增加云、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）英國實行强迫徵兵制而給予義大利官方之印象，甚為深刻、據義官方昨晚承認、英國此舉乃在準備採取堅定立塲、不再予集權國家以任何讓步、同時此間各晚報謂英國決心採取徵兵立法、或係因受法國壓力之結果、各報措詞均企圖給予一般印象、謂炎政府此舉、並未獲得人民之擁護、（二十七日海通電）</p>
<h3>東報評論一斑</h3>

<h3>日本決無餘力　助軸心國作戰　與德義訂軍事同盟　全國人民一致反對</h3>

<h3>香島球屑</h3>
<p>— 南燕自港寄</p>
<p>（一）張榮才最初到香港來的時候，挺走運的，後來又隨着南華會到西貢跑了一趟，紅得發紫了，南華的軍師莫慶還說：「張比包家平譚均幹都好呢」。不過，張榮才這傢伙，能拼命倒是真的，低三路的球，曾經露過幾手，的確有他的長處。似乎太興奮了的緣故，或者多打生疲的緣故，回到香港後，有一個不短的時期，表演得令人失望，幸虧這是發寒熱的病症，現在慢慢地又恢復常態了。</p>
<p>（二）羅斗文最近在南華會裏，亦跌了一個「跟斗」，戰星中華時，一度起用向踢石翼的楊水益，這是失面子的事情，當然此中有些花樣。不過，事實上楊水益並沒有比羅斗文好，這是瞞不過香港各球迷的。但是，話又要說回來，羅斗文亦有些不是，不敢拼命倒是真話，老是萎萎縮縮的，好像主張多一事不如少一事，搶球的時候，差一股子勁兒，教人看了怪不爽快的。總而言子，最大的毛病是：盤弄時拖泥帶水，進攻時缺少一些男子應有的　勁。</p>
<p>有一個時期，就連人家看得亦替他着急了，勸他的嬌妻，早點回上海，省得對於練球上，發生阻力，可是，「內子」不答應，外交沒有辦妥，亦就不了了之。後來，「內子」感覺到有些情形不大樂觀，於是乎祇得忍痛分離。現在，當然要看「外子」怎樣了。</p>
<p>（三）南華到安南去一次，着實賺了一筆錢，東方會看看情形還算好，量量實力亦還算好，想想名望亦還算好，於是拉了幾支人馬，决定亦跑一　，陳福愉很不錯的樣子，做了領隊，許文奎曹秋亭當了要角。截至現在止，一共打了四仗，結果三勝一和，面子　足，不過陳容裏多了一個張金海，算行程，張金海要從重　到海防，最快的話，四月中旬還差不多，這裏面當然有點玄虛。張榮才說：這不是真的張金海，而是由香港聖約瑟請去的金氏。好在安南人亦不認識，管他那一套。</p>
<p>鐘勇森亦去了，東方會愉或為「外江佬」的市面。（未完）</p>

<h3>海關統計表顯示　泰西各國對華貿易慘落　日對華輸出激增四倍　德意商業受同樣損害</h3>
<p>大陸報云、據最近海關統計表透露、泰西各國之對華貿易、突降至近代商業史上所未見之低落、而日本則在侵佔區中之封鎖門戶後、獲得豐厚之酬報、日政府雖堅決吾認在侵佔區內實施之限制貿易條例、乃圖　　歧視外商</p>
<p>但本年最初三月之海關統計表顯示、各主要國家輸華貨物、甚至較去年同期受戰爭影響之數字、降落猶甚、而日本對華輸出、則增四倍以上、日本各殖民地對華輸出、亦達此比例、日本對公開抵制其貨物的中國之輸出、在去年最初三月為一六·九三一·〇〇〇元、本年同期為七一·三八八·〇〇〇元、與此相反、英國對華輸出</p>
<p>降落甚巨</p>
<p>去年一月至三月之數字為二二·二五一·〇〇〇元、降至本年同期之一五·五四九·〇〇〇元、僅中國與英國自治領及殖民地之貿易增加、始予以恢復英國在華貿易之優勢、去年一月至三月、澳洲。英屬東西非。印度。暹羅。加拿大。錫蘭。埃及。香港。紐絲綸。與</p>
<p>英國對華</p>
<p>輸出、共計三四·一二二·〇〇〇元、本年同期、計為五二·四六二·〇〇〇元、因日本限制而受害最巨者、為另兩「軸心」國之德·意·此點頗堪注意、去年最初三月、德國對華輸出、値四五·一八四·〇〇〇元、本年同期僅一八·三二三·〇〇〇元、意國受害尤巨、計自去年最初三月之一三·六八四·〇〇〇元、降至本年同期之一·八四七·〇〇〇元、統計表中最</p>
<p>顯著特色</p>
<p>厥為中國對外輸出之激增、本年最初三月、計一九四·五八三·〇〇〇元、較去年同期數字增加六〇·一二五·〇〇〇兀、此種激增之結果、已使入超巳自去年最初三月之九五·八一二·〇〇〇元、减至本年同期之七九·八五六·〇〇〇元、</p>
<h3>失業日人井上　左工部局切腹　但未達目的而傷勢轉佳　「光榮的犧牲」無從說明</h3>
<p>大陸報云、失業日人井上、年三十五、昨日（二十六日）上午十一時五十分、入工部局大厦、在長廊中徘徊數分鐘、未圖與任何人會晤、即在二樓財務處扶梯口、掏出切腹匕首、企圖切開其胃部、雖血流甚多、但</p>
<p>未受重傷　由救火會救護車飛送北四川路福民醫院、昨晚聞其傷勢、大見好轉不久可望痊愈、據警務處探員於日當局辦理此案前所能確知者、井上係十日前由日來滬、卜居蓬路四四一號、聞渠來上海乃謀工作、但每决申請無不失望、此次企圖切腹、渠未舉原因、但衆信乃經濟困難所逼彼而出此、昨據聲稱、此案不比尋常、因切腹在日本乃認為</p>
<p>消弭罪行之光榮方法、或係犧牲者之殉身、但井上此案、旣未留函、亦未發動人之詞、昨晚據日方消息稱、井上來滬、意欲充華人傀儡之保鑣、彼之圖結束其生命、乃一種抗議、反對工部局處理反日活動之「不忠實」與日當局對工部局取「冷淡」態度云、</p>
<h3>滬甬綫封航後　寗波連遭空襲　圖炸老太平輪但未中的　地方案謐物價略見高漲　鎭海洋面現無日艦踪跡</h3>
<p>本市意商中意輪船公司之恩德輪、前經浙省當局核准、於十九日由滬裝運美麥赴甬、原可即行返滬、旋因徇各方請求裝運土產來滬、經奪波防守司令部電呈第十集團軍核示、當蒙核准裝連酒，錫箔。棉花。棉紗。蛋品。等五種貨物出口、惟絕對不准搭客、該輪奉令後、即於前日下午四時啟椗離甬、業於昨晨七時抵滬、又悉寗波太豐廠現續請當局、准由恩德輪二次裝麥赴甬、但尙未奉核准、</p>
<p>鎭海口外　已無日艦　據恩德輪華籍職員證現代社記者、該輪駛甬時、於二十日晨在鎭海口外、曾遭日艦盤查、除詢問國籍、施行檢査外、並向意籍船主探聽領海華軍凖備情形、意籍船主常答以事關軍情、外人不得而知、日軍無奈、該輪旋即進口、又悉二十一日鎮海聽水門洋面、駛來五號日艦一艘、並未停留、即駛入奉化港湖頭渡、搜査過往民船、至午前十一時許該艦始退出湖頭渡、突向橫山埠與湖頭渡之間海岸、開砲三發、其後迄至恩德離甬時止、未聞日艦騷擾消息、該輪於前日下午駛出鎭海口時、亦未發現日艦踪跡、故地方情形、極為安謐、</p>
<p>日機連日飛甬空襲</p>
<p>又據吿稱、寗波於廿五日上午十時許、突發現日機三架、侵入城空、防空部隊立即發出空襲警報、日機盤旋數匝後、即飛至江北岸上空、竟向停泊招商局碼頭之老太平輪（按該輪係留備沉作封鎖鎭海口之用者）投彈轟炸、計達五六枚、但彈多落江心、並未中的、僅一枚落江邊、碼頭略被損毀、並無死傷、又昨日下午四時、本市航業界接得電吿、寗波昨日又有空襲警報、第一次為上午八時廿分、至九時四十分解除、第二次為十時、至十一時廿五分解除、至有無投彈、則未述及</p>
<p>停航期中物價高漲</p>
<p>自滬甬綫封航後、甬埠各項物價、因來源斷絕、遂見高漲、綢布廣貨等類、平均售價、增達百分之廿五至三十左右、至茶食點心麵粉等、平均亦增價百分之卄至卅、而食米一項、因存糧不充、每担最高價售十五元六角、最低價則為十四元、當局為調劑民食、芷向贛省積極採辦、疏通來源、現時每月仍有八萬包運浙，又鮮鹹貨、因交通困難、亦見增價、惟笋類一項、則因各鄕到貨擁塞、無法運滬、價格反見低跌、</p>
<p>外商油輪已准進口甬江口自於本月五日起、宣告封鎖後、所有船隻、均一概禁阻出入、茲悉民間帆船、業經核准、凡領有通行旗證者、仍准出入甬江、同時甬定航綫、亦經核准天寶高登兩輪、恢復行駛、最近外商亞細亞美孚德士古等三油公司、呈請准予油船進口、業蒙防守部核准、仍照前頒臨時通航辦法規定、計亞細亞三次、美孚三次、德士古二决、</p>

<h3>名人訪問　虞洽卿先生服務社會的精神　生平服膺忠信勤儉四字　數十年奮鬥為中外折服　舊　聞新抄均上海之掌故</h3>
<p>商團中華隊　自大閙公堂案結束之後，本人即發生兩種感想：（一）華人市政權，（二）華人自衛力，對茲兩事，立意堅決，誓必達到目的。爰先致函工部局，要求加舉華人為工部局董事，忿與市政，旋復函僅允本人一人。本人以去題甚遠，非合力要求不可，因即發起華商公會，凡寓居租界各帮各業之領袖商人，一律加入，組織成立，其職權不啻為華人代表委員會，日後之華董，擬即由此產生。惟爭持日久，惜無結果。當巡捕罷崗時，曾由萬國商團出而維持，不但因言語不通，與路人及居民時啟糾紛，且對於華人之利害，往往漠視，益徵華人自衛力之不容忽視，所謂自衛力者，即平民化之有槍階級是也。就租界言，萬國商團，即其自衛力也。無如我國商人，對於武術，一無門徑，故非先加訓練不可，於是由本人發起創立華商體操會，函請各業領袖加入，其經費則由各藥分担。闢操塲於閘北，（即現在華興坊華安坊原址）聘請外國學校肄業而練習兵操之商人為敎練員，登報後，報名者雖衆，但對於穿着黃布之操衣操帽，則皆望而却步，遂由本人與胡寄梅，袁恒之兩君躬先穿着是項衣帽，行走於大庭廣衆，以示表率，衆方踴躍加入，預操者至四五百人之多。經年餘之練習，程度日進，乃商准工部局在萬國商團中添設中華一隊，其隊昌即就體操會會員中遴選百人以充任之。復由本人一一出具保單，以祖保其行為，耗盡心力，費盡脣舌，方能得此結果，但工部局仍有兩種限制：（一）中華隊隊長須由英國人充任，（二）華隊隊員，遇操時向工部局領槍，操畢須繳存工部局，不得持回家中。彼時合埠商人及全隊隊員，以上列兩點，認為工部局有意歧視，表示不滿，本人則以為此係資格及信用問題，非一時口舌之爭，所能收效，事在人為，惟各加勉而巳。自是而後，諸隊員服務成績，既極優良，品性行為，亦均高尙，本人認為時機巳至，始向工部局商准所有華隊隊員之搶，亦許持回家中。至此萬國商團中華隊之待遇，始得與別國商團完全平等，而中華隊服務精神，人人自愛，尤為國人所同聲贊許。是以滬南閘北以及各省各埠，次第仿行組織商團保衛團，而革命軍且藉南市商團之力，以光復上海。夫以服務社會之團體，而竟為國家効力，未始非萬國商團中華隊推及之效果也。</p>
<p>四明銀行及甯紹公司</p>
<p>査各國商業，莫不以輪船銀行為先鋒，本人有意仿行，待機而動，預定步驟，先鄉後國。光緒末葉，華人銀行僅有通商一家，但主權旣操諸外人，而貸借又僅便官宦，是以本人有創辦四明銀行之舉，兼辦儲蓄，以期便和，普及於民衆，名以四明，俾符先鄕後國之本旨也。又滬甬水程，一夜可達，甬人往來，為數尤多，光緒末葉，行駛此航綫者，僅太古之北京及招商之江天兩輪，行旅固屬有求過於供之苦，而統艙票價每人一元，復較他綫為昂。於是法人組設東方公司，以立大輪船加入行駛，而太古聯合招商跌價以相競爭，其統船票價，遂减至五角。厥後相持一年，三公司協議同盟，將票價漲至一元，本人分向三公司接洽，要求將統艙票價永遠以五角為限，否則甬人當自創公司，　船行駛，往復磋商，未嘗許可。本人遂邀集同鄉發起組織寗紹公司，惟彼時鄉人先進之旅滬者，間有因別種關係，均不肯加以贊助，幸民智漸開，而一般普通之工商界，則頗加以擁護，慘淡經營，公司方得以成立。第輪船營業以碼頭為唯一之工具，當時黃浦沿岸較好地段，悉為外人佔定，故先向日人商租外白渡橋東洋公司碼頭未成，繼向三德堂商租法領館對出之外洋涇橋南首碼頭又未成，後擇十六舖外灘；而其時南市十六舖迤南岸綫，又悉被大達輪埠公司所包租。該公司股東復與東方公司有關，是以又未成，不得已乃分向南京兩江總督及北京農工商部請願，得南通張季直先生之助，始得租定，且得從事建造棧房焉。爰本統艙水，而同綫同業，聯合跌價，由堅持一元之票價，减至兩角，以冀藉資本力量，而打倒寗紹，同鄉諸君，同心協力，組織航業維持會，慕集現款，對外由該會賣票，定為三角，不足之數，由該會認貼，為數達十餘萬元之巨，中國民族之團結，遂漸為外人所注意矣。（三）</p>

<p>……愛情生長於春天，莫辜負了良辰……</p>
<p>這是已婚男女或是未婚情侶的切身問題。當此快樂的春天，有的夫婦果然情深如海，樂勝於飛。生育着伶俐的子女，組織美滿的家庭，融融洽洽，有說不盡的幸福！然而也有不少的夫婦，雖然在此月白風淸的春之良宵，演出同床異夢，或竟勃谿失歡等等的悲劇！春天應當是生長愛情的天，今愛情反在春天而動搖了，毀滅了，此何故呢？</p>
<p>我們研究愛情的基礎，實少不了此三大要件，就是環境，心情，以及天賦的本能。夫婦間如果感覺到，老是株守在家屋中，缺少了興趣，那末乘此春光明媚的季節，去到花園中或是郊野之外小作遊逛，或作短期的旅行，則一朝縱目千里之外，眼看雙雙蝴蝶紛飛，對對池魚游躍，萬紫千紅點綴成錦繡的春色，此時此景，旣愉悅了心神眼界，他倆的愛情也必增長百倍，這就是環境增長了愛情的事例，此外男子在外得了一個好消息，或是做了一件滿意的事或是得了一筆意外的進款，這時，因他心情的歡喜，他們夫婦問的愛情亦必增長百倍，所以愛情與環境及心情，實息息相關，聰明夫婦必能善用之。</p>
<p>不過，愛情雖與環境及心情有莫大的關係，主要的基礎乃為天賦的本能，一個聰明的健壯丈夫，他必能利用環境，創造環境，來陶冶心情，愉悅心情。所以這是不成問題的。要是男子於早年犯有自凟遺精，或荒淫縱慾以及憂勞斵傷之故，在天賦的本能上爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精力渙散，久婚不育等症，則雖當此良晨美景，心情愉悅之時，愛情亦必幻滅於頃刻，然而他的妻子因得不到歡慰，感覺年華虛度，能不悲忿？家庭悲劇，大都即由此而生，欲謀補救唯一辦法，即服雄壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最為對症特效。因此劑於服後即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，上述各症必可於短期內完全治愈，並可收延年益壽之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速。患者若能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療注射，手術等各種科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>乳峯發育的新方法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>優美的乳峯，的確可以增加女子健美的姿態。所謂曲線，那無疑地完全為乳峯所操縱。假使沒有高聳的乳峯，試問曲線可能豐富而顯露嗎？我想自然是不能的，所以乳峯發育，幾成為摩登女子的必修課。她們鑒於發育的不能達到標準。便不惜用種種方法來魚目混珠。可是當春閨喜劇序幕揭開的時候。這種西洋鏡依然拆穿，被男子看得半文錢都不値，或甚至冷言熱諷，使她羞愧無地！</p>
<p>然則女性胡為而有此缺陷？此據中西著名婦科醫師及余研究結果。均認為完全由於營養不良，自凟，白帶，大病侵害，惡瘧經年，月經不調，以及產後失於調補等各種原因，遂致卵巢機能失健，景響新陳代謝作用，故乳房鬆弛而萎　，甚至平坦一如男子，臀部瘦削，肌肉枯槁，而允其覺得可憎者，雖在妙齡年華，而額上已滿佈皺紋，以這樣醜陋的女子，而欲角勝情塲，或博得丈夫的歡心，尙可得乎？唯一補救辦法，祗有服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最為對症而特效。蓋此劑係由德國醫聖斯丹那博士歷三十餘年之艱辛實騐發明，復經歐美名醫多人之化騐證明，認為藥性和平，功效偉大，無論各種婦女隱病，均能在短期內統治全愈。如繼續服用，不惟可使萎瘪的乳峯，變成高聳，同時還能消滅子宮病患。促進姙娘機能，美顏烏髮，長註靑春。</p>
<h3>遺精青年遭遇的悲慘</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>靑年人性的苦悶，這誠然是有的。不過，你們應有豐富的理智，來引導你們走上光明大道，胡為被情性一時的衝動，而墮入了萬丈深淵。我們也知道，在春情發動期的性慾，是强烈的。可是切不可因性的苦悶，就犯上自凟，要知自凟一次之後，即有二次再犯的傾向，極易迭成惡習。惡習旣深，遺精幾為不可避免的事。</p>
<p>精液在體內，功能助長發育機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，滋養各部神經。遺精初起，如果治療得早，對於身體的損害尙少，且較易治愈，若因循苟且，勢必至精枯血竭，那發育機能受阻，致發育不全，局部短小如指者有之，新陳代謝作用減退，腦，脊髓，性三大神經受其摧殘，凡腦衰健忘，失眠多夢，腰酸背痛，早洩陽萎，精薄不育等症必相繼而來，此種靑年，多病多痛，不特學術與事業無成，為社會所吐棄，並因面黃肌瘦貌之不揚，必為女性所不喜，陷於失戀痛苦，總之，他所遭遇者，無非悲慘而已！</p>
<p>遺精的特效療法，在此時祇有服「希米晚氏固精片」最為可靠，因此劑於服後卽能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，遺精自可痊愈。若因遺精巳引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可早日完全恢復健康。患者如能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療注射手術等各種對症療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<p>白濁論壇</p>
<p>— 淋病專科戴德醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：北京路四川路轉角</p>
<p>義務送診僅收號金四角</p>
<h3>淋濁爲何要再發？</h3>
<p>在於經騐的臨床家，對於淋毒這種毛病，必然努力爲病家根治至完全根治爲止，他决不放棄中途放棄神聖的責任，而使用霸烈的藥物，笨拙的手術，施行不正當之療法，使病情强制壓伏，致釀成後患。</p>
<p>例如在急性白濁時期，醫家因了要博到病家的信仰起見，使用强烈的洗滌法，或霸烈的藥物，結果暫覺排膿停止，尿液澄淸，或於小便時僅僅看到二三點淋系，此時醫家往往對病家説，你的病已完全好了，不必治療了，可是許多病家往往回家没有幾天，依然就要再發了。要知淋毒的病原菌，不僅繁殖於粘膜之全面，而且往往由粘膜的深入，或蔓延到鄰接的附屬器官，在此等部分內又重新搆成病灶。所以雖用强烈之洗滌藥，縱然僥倖把粘膜表面上的病象治好，而鄰接的各附屬器官，又復發作起來了。要知尿中有淋系固然是未根治，即肉眼看去尿液已經澄淸了，也不能斷定牠已治愈。</p>
<p>要避免上列各種弊端，只有使用德國濾淋平流電療法，及超特之化學療法兼用，才能迅速將淋菌撲滅，因濾淋平流電療具有廣泛而深入的强大殺菌力，並能澄淸其毒素，更齊之以超特療法。與敏捷無痛之手術，那麽因爲殺菌力既然十分透徹，而毒素更爲之澄淸，那末一經治愈，絶無再發之事。</p>
<p>診時：上午九時至午後六時止　　科目</p>
<p>兼治梅毒。横痃。下疳及無痛苦新法割除包皮。</p>

<h3>足以興奮的事實</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>幾天來的沈悶，為了足以興奮的消息—不，事實，掃去了不少。這是南昌的克復，這是英國的徵兵。</p>
<p>本來一地的得失，在我們全盤的抗戰計劃之下，是無足輕重的，所以各大城市有時可以放棄，但南昌很重要；據電傳巳克服了，而開封巳三進三出。因此現在，我軍的攻入南昌，並不單是說，我軍收復南昌的可喜，乃更是說，我軍有足以攻入南昌的力量的可喜，南昌旣足以攻入，何地不足以攻入！我軍的實力，可見一斑，誰不為之興奮！</p>
<p>以言英國，自從張伯倫決心阻遏侵略者的野心以來，盤馬彎弓，也不知取過多少方式，有過多少手續，一直至最近，似乎還沒有什麽切實的成就，未免令人失望。現在他所領導的政府，毅然決然，實施微兵制了，這一個舉動的成就，我以為不在反侵略組織果然見諸實行之下。因為：一，從此英國有所準備，不致臨事而懼，一味遷就侵略者了；二，法蘇各民治國，對英國也就格外放心，知道她不見得以別國為貓脚爪，為她在炭火裹取爆栗了。英國的決心，初次切實見之行動，誰不也為之興奮，</p>
<p>當然，我們不能以興奮為滿足。因為興奮大都是一時的，缺少永久價値的。因此，我們於這决的興奮之餘，我們還是要冷靜下來，而促使這足以興奮的事實，終於成為足以滿足的勝利。</p>
<p>我希望；在這一個興奮之下，我們全國同胞，不論在前方或後方，都能够加强我們的力量，使我們最後的勝利，早　得以實現。攻入開封之後而攻南昌，我們已確實走上勝利之途了。</p>
<p>我希望：在這一個興奮之下，英國不再遊移不定，果然能够切實做去，使侵略者無所施其伎。實在，最近漢特森的返任，希特勒不見，外長不見，僅見决長，也可以說受盡奚落了，在這一個刺激之下，至少也應該有所醒悟吧！</p>
<p>我相信：精神超過一切，只耍誰都有決心，滿足的勝利準是會從速實現的，又豈但興奮的事實而已！</p>
<h3>細雨</h3>
<p>— 恝栔</p>
<p>窗外又下起濛濛的畨雨，細得像秋毫之末，飛到坡璃窗上，將玻璃模糊了。</p>
<p>細雨飛到大地上，細小的水點融和攏來，大地濕了。</p>
<p>細雨飛到人底臉上，像鋼針一般，把臉刺得發痛。</p>
<p>細雨又飛到人底身上，鑽進衣服的布隙裏，擰得下水來。</p>
<p>這細雨，一次次地下着，連綿不斷。它究竟是為了些什麽啊？</p>
<p>大地上，佈滿了灰塵，垢汚，卑鄙和無恥。窒息了人們底呼吸，遮沒了人們底視覺；把淸白底人染上汚穢，把崇高底人壓得卑下。魔鬼乘機大施橫行，世界是在瘋在起來啦</p>
<p>人們，在這種情形之下，完全失去了他們底理智；好似受了不可解救的迷藥，辨別不了一切，絲毫沒有一點兒反抗，儘量地俯伏在魔鬼脚下，任憑魔鬼們玩弄，欺侮。</p>
<p>人們所做底事業，因為失去了主人，一齊停頓下來。毀的毀了，汚的汚了，再也不能放出萬丈的光芒，來做人們底助手。整個的社會立刻向後馳轉，永遠不會前進了。</p>
<p>黑暗呑沒了全世界；</p>
<p>細雨，它看不慣這情形，它不願再忍耐下去，它要洗刷滌盪全世界，逐走魔鬼，使得灰塵，垢汚，卑鄙和無恥，永久不再生長。它鼓起勇氣，雖然它底力量是那末小，但是它不屈不撓地，一决，二次，三次，飛着，飛着，飛着。</p>
<p>玻璃窗模糊了，它是在使得人們來揩拭，逐走黑暗，重新見到光明。</p>
<p>大地濕了，它是使得人們來洗刷滌盪灰塵和垢汚，得着淸朗。</p>
<p>人底臉發痛，它是在使得人們警覺，不要再做迷夢，快撲滅外來的打擊囂張。</p>
<p>鑽進衣服的布隙裏，它是在使得人們有勇氣，有毅力，來阻止魔鬼的侵蝕，要竭力反抗！</p>
<p>一次次地下着，它是在訓練人們有恒久的精神來奮鬥，不容許在中途輟止！</p>
<p>哦，連綿的細雨，是多麼偉大的啊！</p>
<p>我們秉着奮鬥的精神，我們受着細雨的暗示，我們來廓淸我們底社會，施給到整個的地球，光明在前面了！</p>
<p>窗外飛着的濛濛的細雨，是驅除黑暗的明燈！</p>
<h3>蘆葦叢中</h3>
<p>— 思方</p>
<p>！！趙家渡的一夜</p>
<p>趙家渡，黃浦江上一個荒凉的小渡口。隱伏在蘆葦叢裏，船隻很少在這裏碇泊，鎭日的靜寂得可怕，風吹着蘆葦，蕭蕭地在響。</p>
<p>現在是晚上了，黃浦江的夕潮，拍擊着灘岸，呼嘯聲像凄厲的哀哭。蘆葦叢給埋葬在濃濃的夜色裏，灣着牠們的頭，夜風打着嗚咽的唿哨吹過來，那些頭向左向右的擺動着。</p>
<p>在黝黑的天空裏，掛着像死人面孔一樣慘白的月亮，灑下來的淡白的光，更慘愁而哀怨。</p>
<p>突然，蘆葦叢中發出着悉索的聲響。還有脚步在淺水裏移動的孔孔的水聲，同降輕微的低語聲，混和着嗚咽的風聲，高一陣低一陣的聽不淸楚。</p>
<p>半個鐘頭以後，什麼聲音都沒有了，祇有江水壓着沈重的嗓昔在吶喊着，一大團一大團的泡沫，打着漩渦，衝到灘邊，滾入蘆葦叢中。</p>
<p>月亮給一團烏雲遮住了，沒有一絲微光，四下裏完全像漆一般的黑。</p>
<p>蘆葦叢中，有非常輕微的，但是很急促的呼吸聲透露出來。黃浦江的吶喊的夕潮聲中，有木槳潑水的聲音，嘩啦嘩啦的響着。</p>
<p>有一隻小船從對岸很迅捷的搖過來。</p>
<p>從墨黑的夜色中，可以隱的地看到船上坐着五六個穿着黃衣服的人，身上全背着槍，睜大着如鷹鷲一般的眼睛，貪婪地看着漆黑的夜空。有幾個在愉快地打着唿哨，有時候發出高聲的笑語。</p>
<p>——搖得快一點！</p>
<p>一陣吆喝聲像急雷一般的在寂靜的夜空裏爆散開來，於是木槳的潑水聲更急促，船也行得更快了。</p>
<p>蘆葦叢中，輕輕的有一陣騷動，有脚步在水聲裏移動。</p>
<p>——快！預備好！赤老的船搖近了。</p>
<p>有一聲低沈的命令，繼着是相互間的嘁嘁喳喳的低語聲之後，又什麽都靜靜的了，只有夜風的嗚咽聲，潮水的拍岸聲，和中流木槳打水的聲音，像合奏着抑鬱的交響樂。</p>
<p>小船漸漸的搖近岸邊了，船上的人高興的笑着。</p>
<p>——砰！</p>
<p>第一響槍聲從蘆葦叢中響了出來，繼着一速串的槍聲響起來了。彈流朝着小船的方向射過來，像疾雨裏夾帶着堅硬的冰雹，一股子濃烟從蘆葦叢中湧了出來，火光閃躍在黑暗的夜空裏。</p>
<p>等黃衣人從驚愕中跳起來，提起槍瞄準的時候，有兩個已經躺倒在船頭上了，鮮紅的血從船頭上汨汨地流到江中。</p>
<p>不盡的彈流從蘆葦叢中射出來，船上的槍彈也無目的地向蘆葦叢中射進去。</p>
<p>靜寂的趙家渡現在是熱閙了，子彈像瘋在一般的在空中飛嘯着，蘆葦叢中的喊聲，像從幾千支喉嚨裏發出來的怒吼聲；火光燒紅了半個天。</p>
<p>一個鐘頭以後，在暴的槍聲過去了，火光也消滅了，火藥臭，血腥氣，混雜着飄浮在寗靜的空氣中。</p>
<p>黃浦江上一隻小船翻了身，幾個屍體隨了波浪翻滾着，黃濁的流水中混着鮮紅的血。</p>
<p>蘆葦叢中也有鮮紅的血流到江中，有幾個人在發出慘痛的呻吟聲，可是給雄壯的呌喊聲和歡歌聲遮沒了。</p>
<p>這時候天已黎明了，晨光射到茂密的蘆葦叢中。</p>
<h3>軸心遇阻</h3>
<p>— 麗華</p>
<h3>孔云亭與與盧梭</h3>
<p>— 窮夫</p>
<p>—展卷有益錄</p>
<p>孔云亭在「桃花扇」底前記裏面叙述他這個劇本的流傳的經過，有這樣兩條：</p>
<p>「桃花扇」本成，王公薦紳莫不借鈔，時有紙貴之勢。乙卯夕，內侍索桃花扇」甚急。予之繕本，忘懷遺傳何所，乃於張平州中丞家覓得一本，午夜進之直邸，遂入內府。</p>
<p>庚辰四月，予巳解組，木庵先生招觀「桃花扇」，一時翰部臺省羣公咸集，讓予獨居上座，命諸伶更番進觴，邀予品題。</p>
<p>座客嘖嘖指顧，頗有凌雲之氣。</p>
<p>這一看就知道作者是在引為榮耀的。但這却細想不得。「桃花扇」是「以抒寫明朝亡國之痛為主旨」的，而作者却以得到淸朝皇帝底垂顧和淸朝王公大人底捧塲為得意，眞呌人想不通是怎麼一回事。難道眞的證實了我們一些「學者」底主張，所謂作品和作者底人格竟一點都不相關嗎？</p>
<p>但是也隨牠，就讓那些「學者」去高興好了。不過我却因為這個想起了會經被我們「學者」所痛罵過的一位法國底古人。</p>
<p>盧梭在他底「懺悔錄」第八卷中叙述到他底歌劇「Le　devin　du　village」上演時的情形，眞有點和孔云亭所得意的塲面相像。他說他以作者的身分也坐在一間包廂裏面，就在他對面却坐着皇帝，皇后，所有宮庭中的人物，而他是鬍子也不剃，衣服也不換，就那樣高坐在那兒，靜聆着四圍那些貴族太太們底讚賞，品評，唧哩咕嚕。他又叙述到上演後的情形，却比較孔云亭所得意的更要値得羨慕。他說一到了第二天，皇帝就耍召見他，還要親自賜給他年金。</p>
<p>大家都知道盧梭是皇帝和貴族的死敵，就是在當時算是成功了的那個劇本，固然現在已經公認是不高明的作品了，但那內容却還是抒寫平民底情感，在發揮着他底主張的。但是他把皇帝和貴族對他要好的情形那樣叙述出來，却好像表明牠自己在引為榮耀。這分明和孔云亭一樣，也是自己在打着自己的耳光。</p>
<p>照這樣看來，我們底「學者」痛駡盧梭，實在是不應該的。盧梭不是也帮着證明了諸位底主張了嗎？</p>
<p>但是莫忙。盧梭雖然叙述了他和皇帝，和貴族坐在一起，可是他所得意的却是他的毫不修飾，以平民的服裝，和皇帝和貴族坐在一起的這一點上。接着他還大大地發揮了一下他不剃鬍子，不換衣服的道理，意思是：我看我的戲，管他媽的去。雖然也叙述了皇帝要見他，但即刻就說他不要見皇帝，而且還用諷刺的筆法說了一些他不要見皇帝的理由。盧梭畢竟有些「煞風景」，終於不能像我們底孔云亭，所以結果只落得一個毫不得意。</p>
<p>到頭是中國有的，外國實在未必有，盧梭就是不湊趣的一個，我現在纔明白我們底「學者」要痛罵他的原因了。</p>
<p>但是莫忙。你倘是讀過從前我們底一位「學者」介紹懺悔錄」的大著，讀到關於上面說的那兩段時，却就呌你不能不為之愕然。盧梭和皇帝，和貴挨坐在一起，是被介紹了；可是盧梭發揮他看不起上流裝束的一大堆話，却完全被逐出了「化外」，不見一點影子。皇帝要見盧梭，也介紹了；可是盧梭說他不要見皇帝的那種諷刺的文字，却被改換面目地意譯了兩句完事。原來我們這位「學者」硬要使盧梭和我們歷史上的文學作家一模一樣。這工作算是做成功了。只是那般痛駡盧梭的「學者」又好像沒有看見這個大著，可惜，可惜。</p>

<h3>中國新歌劇在誕生中</h3>
<p>— 夏洛</p>
<p>歐亞劇藝公司改名國際劇藝公司　國際大劇院决定今年年底前落</p>
<p>有人把皮簧和崑劇等稱為「中國的歌劇」。皮簧和崑劇是吾可以算是「中國的歌劇」？目不說它，而中國的新歌劇還未建立起來則是事實。</p>
<p>誠然，我們也看到過揚子江暴風雨」（可惜該劇的編者和主演者聶耳先生巳經死了），在最近，更看到了吳曉邦編劇，陳歌辛配樂作曲，而由中法劇藝學校同學演出的「罌粟花」。這些都是中國新歌劇的樣品，但以質和量上來說，我們都還不能滿足，尤其是，要沒有一個經常的組織來做開拓的工作，則自生自滅，是很難把新歌劇建立起來的。</p>
<p>新歌劇的內容和形式應該怎樣？這有待於高明者的討論，也不是這短的篇幅所能允許的。不過大體上是可以想像得到的？一方面吸收和融化歐美歌劇的所長，一方面，也將有中國自己固有的成份，兩者融合，中國的新歌劇才於焉確立。</p>
<p>這裏所要報告給諸位的，是中國的新歌劇將在有計劃下誕生的消息。</p>
<p>我們大概不會忘記在不久之前，蘭心大戲院曾演過一次歌劇、卡門」。演出這戲的是歐亞劇藝公司。「卡門」在那次演出雖是法國歌劇，但演出這戲的歐亞劇藝公司則頗有雄心使中國的新歌劇建立起來。在一卞門一公演之後，他們更是熱心於這點，現在計劃已經決定，並且隨了組織的增多和擴大，連名稱也決計改稱為一國際劇藝公司」。</p>
<p>國際劇藝公司的計劃大致是分四個部門：（一）原有的法國歌劇班，最近將到西貢，河內，爪哇，新加坡一帶去作旅行表演，在這决旅行表演中，他們打算再向法國邀請幾位歌劇人才來，然後在西貢，河內和上海建立起一個表演網，使得以後可以輪流上演。西貢和河內，戲院是不成問題的，因為法政府對藝術相當提倡，那邊的法國當局一定能給他們一個好戲院，至於上海，則他們打算自己建立一個戲院。（二）這個戲院，除表演外國歌劇之外，也打算演中國的歌劇和話劇，乃至改良平劇和崑劇，務使在設備上是最完備，最適合於表演話劇和歌劇的戲院，在上演節目上，也是十足是精神食糧的倉庫。戲院的名稱呌國際大劇院，地點在法租界中區，鬧中有靜，同時交通則十分便利，戲院的圖樣在起草中，股款也募得差不多了，若干餘額，則準備不久後公開招募（三）至於表演中國新歌劇的團體，則最近巳組織就緖，劇本也正在寫作中。可以報告讀者的。則是他們已經開過好幾决的劇本討論會，下星期一起，並且將開始排練，社名是國際歌劇社，和國際藝劇公司的關係是等於中法聯誼會戲劇組織和上海劇藝社。參加者的名字和社址等等，現在暫時還得保守一下秘密，這是要向讀者吿罪的；可以透一點天機」的，是他們決定社員（特別是演員）儘可能的使用新人，務期不使和話劇方面的發生衝突，以免分散人力，好在新歌劇旣是新的拓荒工作，就讓新的人員來拓荒也更有意思。（四）同時為了造就新的歌劇幹部人才起見，他們還打算設立一個歌劇訓練班，這批新的生力軍一方面可使將來演出水準的提高，而在量上，將來歌劇運動發展開來，也的確需要他們來充實和領導，正如現在話劇那樣，需要新的生力軍來補充和充實。歌劇訓練班的設立，雖然將在歌劇社的工作有了步驟以後，但目下也巳開始在找尋房子，因為歌劇社的工作，相信在最近就可以走上正軌的。</p>
<p>這些計劃在現在雖然大部份還是紙面上的，不過已經開始在力行了，所以不久之後，當能具體起來，並且當能有點成績可以見到，例如國際大劇院，就準備在今年年底前落成，而那時，國際劇藝社的吻個歌劇，也該早巳公演過了。</p>
<h3>「西宮春怨」觀感</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>“Girl　School”</p>
<p>哥倫比亞公司出品　大上海映</p>
<p>「西宮春怨」告訴我們美國一所女學校（其實也可以說是一般的）的情形。這情形也落了「外國有，我們也有」的差不多情形，譬如，本刋上曾登過一篇「劇壇外史」，王蘋小姐就為了演戲，被學校當局認為「有玷校譽」而開除的。而一般的為了「戀愛」所鬧出來的「風潮」，也是多得很。舍監的檢査學生書信，女宿舍的宛如禁宮，但是這樣的小心防範，事實上是吾完滿呢？這不用我來回答，「風潮」的發生就是最確實的答案。自然，年輕的女孩子們，對於她們的「終身大事」該慎之又愼的，但是矯枉過正，也能適得其反地為害更大呢！</p>
<p>「西宮春怨」中的琳璉，就因為一夜未歸而被學校當局決定開除了，開除的理由是「有玷校譽」。但是當琳璉的父親辛浦森願「出資興建圖書館，捐贈學校」之後，校長亦「遂寢其事」。這樣，不免使人想到「學校」之稱為「學店」，並不是過份的諷刺。並且，「西宮春怨」尙有更甚的諷刺，就是最後那位年逾花信的女敎員，第一個偕其情人私奔。這或許是「演戲」，但是人總是人倒底是事實，要那些年輕的女學生們，像囚犯一樣的鎖在「宮」里，是不是最好的「管理」方法呢？</p>
<p>我們不反對學校當局的防範森嚴，也不反對為了「違背校規」而開除，但是在用着漂亮的名詞「有玷校譽」的時候、該想一想這「管理」方法是不是合理的，也是不是有什麼「不到之處」？因為旣經發生了「事故」，學校當局至少也該負一些責任的啊！</p>
<p>「西宮春怨」在暴露某些學校的「假正經」，不能不說它是一個比較有意義的劇本。但是，因為導演者的手腕軟弱，它祇是牛鋪直叙的吿訴我們這樣一個「故事」，諷刺的力量是一些也看不到的。同時如女學校的空氣，及琳璉和萊特麗的始而交惡，繼而結為好友，它的過程也是不够的。即是本片中最熱鬧的一塲戲—聯歡會，也並不出色。</p>
<p>幾個演員，也是平平而已張蘭亭先生：</p>
<h3>代郵</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>張蘭亭先生：</p>
<p>承賜關於「英雄小戰士」挿圖之敎言，我們非常感謝你的指正，同時更將自勉，決不辜負讀者愛護本刊的熱忱，但是最後一點，事實是最有力的證，明儘可請先牛釋懷的。並希望其他的讀者能時賜敎言，不勝幸甚。</p>
<h3>美國加州初期的華僑</h3>
<p>— 伯明</p>
<p>美國加利福尼亞州新近發現的紀錄，對於華人在加州參加採金和建造鐵路的範圍，有了新的發現。華工建造美國和加拿大各橫貫大陸鐵路的西端，是衆所熟知之事，但華人在加州參加早期的採金，知者尙少。附圖表示華人從事淘金和建造鐵路，原載一份舊報紙上，現在是從舊金山區供華僑孤兒就學的中美學校機關報中美紀事報上轉載過來的。</p>
<p>據該報所載一文稱：最先移殖加州的華人，乘美國帆船　號，一八四八年二月在舊金山登陸，計男子二，女子一，女子在吉萊斯巴氏家中帮傭，兩男子則往當時新發現的令礦中去作工。其他消息還說有販賣茶，扇，肩巾筆東方物品的陳明（譯音），在一八四七年到達加州。那末，陳明還比三人先到。陳也加入淘金，獲金頗多，立即致書廣州友人蔡雲（譯音），不久蔡雲和其妻也到加州覓金。</p>
<p>加州發現黃金的消息傳到廣州，幾乎和美國東海岸一樣的大起哄動。華人稱它為金山，至今仍用此名呼加州。一八四八年杪，在加州全境登記的華人祇七名，但至一八五〇年一月，巳有八百人：是年底，已有四千人；而至一八五一年杪，竟增至一萬二千人；一八六〇年調査戶口所得，幾有三萬人；一八七〇年，已逾六萬人；而在一八八〇年，華人人口達空前的高度，計有十萬餘人。</p>
<p>由於發現黃金而造成的特殊社會情况，舊金山華人乃操洗衣業，後來這種活動傳遍全美國。「紳士」和早期在加州淘金致富者的標徵是摺漿白襯衫，它却成為眞正的奢侈品，因為人人都從事淘金，婦女又少，所以洗滌白襯杉成為嚴重的問題，洗衣費漲得過份昂貴。有許多人把襯衫交船隻帶往火奴魯魯洗滌，確實較為經濟。就在那時候，勤勉的華人覺得這是極好的機會，便從事洗漿白襯衫，於是華人洗衣店到處紛紛開設，大受歡迎，被稱為「互惠協會」。</p>
<p>但有許多華人入山採金，也有許多發現多量的貴金屬，華人源源而入礦山，所得工資，較愛爾蘭移民所得的為低，致發生偏見與仇視，卒起暴動，和反華人運動。在鐵路上也是如此，愛爾蘭移民勞工和大多為愛爾蘭籍的土著政治家，都因華人而發生嚴重糾紛，後來，採金日益困難，且有費鉅資購備機械的必要，華人遂轉而經營商店，栽培園圃和其他事業。（譯自密勒氏評論週報）</p>
<h3>CHINSE　IN　CALIFORNIF-EARLY　DAYS</h3>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　含悲菇苦淚灑四廂　崇儉習勞體勤十畝</p>
<p>且說蘇理雅太太與金澹雲，商量開辦家庭式的新型汽車公司。金澹雲說是為試辦起見，假定資本為三百萬元。蘇理雅太太算了一算，說是：『那種車子，平均製造費，每輛要三萬元。我們姑且以五十輛車子計算，就得一百五十萬元。其餘的一百五十萬元，為種種設備之用。總行當然是設在上海，我們先在江南的公路上試辦起來，譬如在南京，蘇州，杭州等處，也設立幾處分行。好在造房子倒不必花什麼大價錢，只要能安放車輛就是了。這五十輛車子之中，預備供家庭用的，是三十輛；預備工程師用的，是十輛；預備學者們探訪用的，也是十輛。雖然這是一個假定，但也有一點意思。為的是普通還是供家庭旅行之用，最好是一夫一妻，至多還添一個小孩子。允其是適用的，供人家新夫婦的蜜月旅行，在這個蜜月之中，擇風景最佳麗的地方，把車子開到那裏，就住到那裹，豈不是最自由嗎？在我們歐美，最尊重新婚蜜月，我記得十餘年前，從美國飛行到中國來的大型飛機，什麽飛剪號中，每一飛機，就預備一間新夫婦同居的房，以便他們蜜月旅行之用。直到如今，這些大型飛機上，每備有夫婦同居的房間。此刻我們流行了這種車子，單是做蜜月旅行的這筆生意，可就不少咧。所以我預備供家庭旅行用的要佔五分之三，關於工程師用的，少些也不妨。為的將來倘有大的工業機關，工程師必須要用此等車子的，他們也許要自己打出樣子來，託汽車製造公司給他們製造。或者是測量用的，或者是監工用的，一個大工業機關，自己應該置備那些車子的，未必要向人家租賃。至於學者們研究探索用的車子呢，我們固然要備的；不過學者們的硏究所，到底在室內的居多數，在車內的居少數。而且有許多是要另外一種設備的，所以只好少備一些一。蘇理雅太太這樣的計畫，金澹雲覺得很是。但蘇理雅太太在中國投資創辦一種實業，她不肯獨資經營，她一定要與中國朋友合作，資本方面，她可以担任一半，利益平分。（九七）</p>

<h3>從劉寶全說到藝人的修養</h3>
<p>— 海測</p>
<p>優伶名角，享名不久，</p>
<p>運氣人緣，無甚關係；</p>
<p>全是烟·財·酒·色作崇！</p>
<p>鼓王劉寶全，在大鼓一行中，眞好比得平劇的譚鑫培，漢調的余洪元，非但空前，簡直是絕後的了。我聽他的玩藝，還在他第一次到滬時節，距今已有二十餘年，地點似在新世界雜耍部，聽的戲有截江奮斗，戰長沙，烏龍院，草船借箭等幾　現在是第三次來滬，——第二次在三年前，未聽。當年聞名而往，因我是南人，不能完全領略他的詞兒，但覺得他音節之妙，確與白雲鵬不同，現在可以重溫舊曲，而且也許是最後的一次了。（劉年已七十一，此次北返，不知再來何日？）</p>
<p>我前天見到了劉寳全的風度，長方的臉，比前淸　得多了，頭上已禿得明晃晃的，只有腦後一撮斑白的禿髮，他雖年逾古稀，精神却還矍鑠，馳名數十年，藝術至今不衰，嗓音依然瀏亮，聽說有一大原因：他生平絕對沒有一些嗜好，烟，酒，色，和共他消極的消遣，什麽都不喜歡，可見藝人對於「修養」，是有絕大的關係，許多優伶名角，像曇花一現般的，享名不久，便又寂然無聞，他們委之「運氣」或「人緣」等說，其實還是「修養」做了主要原因，佔了最大的成分呢！</p>
<h3>劉寶全律己之嚴</h3>

<p>鼓界大王劉寶全。前歲獻藝於本埠大中華書塲後。成績甚佳。雖座價高到一元。每日仍必客滿。足證滬人對其藝術歡迎之熱烈矣。按劉本係出身梨圖。習生行。文武兼擅。後以見當時鬚生人材鼎盛。如欲出人頭地。殊非易易。因遂棄伶而專研鼓業。彼天賦歌喉。高朗圓潤。一時無出其右者。兼以幼會習武。故奏一戰長沙」關黃對刀之身段時。宛如舞台上在譚諸大名伶之工架。且唱時有聲有色。能使合座動容。精神被其吸引以去。觀其怒。台下亦怒。聞其悲。台下亦悲。其演「寗武關」也。則可以振奮人心。廉頑立懦。其歌「大西廂」也。則又婀娜娉婷。活畫出一對才子佳人之聲調姿態。所謂裝誰像誰。對於書中人之個性。性別。均能體貼入微也。且大鼓書之難。難在一人而兼摹男女老幼。文武尊卑種種不同之聲音笑貌。語言動作。寳全歌來。不但均能維妙維肖。且其腔調之佳。嗓音之圓。在在均足以壓倒儕輩。「大鼓大王」之崇銜。乃幾於衆口一詞。萬人中無一異言　。吁。劉氏誠可謂藝術界之傑矣。</p>
<p>劉氏現年已七十一歲。生子女各一人。女適徐州人李某。子名紹卿。係北平滙文學院畢業生。中英文頗有根柢。平素西裝革履。絕不類藝人子。寳全縱橫歌壇數十年。家中頗有積蓄。不願其干紹繼箕裘。故曾獨資創辦劉氏私立小學於舊京。紹卿自任校長。成績斐然。近年紹卿以乃翁春秋日高。復時往外埠奏技。遂不得不擺脫校務。隨侍老親。並處理對內對外一切事務。余與紹卿係十年舊友。據其吿余云。其尊人平素律己綦嚴。對於衣食住行。皆有一定之規則。茲略述其極概如后。</p>
<p>劉氏之衣　渠性嗜樸素。所服之衣。多係一二十年前所製。雖式樣古舊。然整潔異常。登台之前。彬彬有禮。迨向觀衆鞠躬致敬後。必先詳述本日所唱書中之情節。然後徐徐脫其所御之馬褂。於是手執楗板。即開始奏其佳曲矣。</p>
<p>劉氏之食　彼平時以素食為主。對於酸辣及含有激刺性之食物。一槪摒絕。肉食亦絕少入口。每値友朋招宴。多謝絕不往。必不得已時。輒令紹卿代之。數十年來。彼始終能維護其佳喉無稍損傷者。蓋其得力於飲食之有節制。不作無謂之酬應。斯有以致之耳。</p>
<p>劉氏之住　北平前門外。有其自購之住宅一所。院落淸潔。室內設備幽雅。門窗啟閉。概有定時。對於空氣之流通。起居之有規律。皆為劉氏數十年來一成不變之生活。樸而無華。不尙外表。於此亦可見其性情之一斑矣。</p>
<p>劉氏之行　劉氏家居時。每於飯後。輒作戶外運動。緩步當車。常至空曠之地。繞行半小時。藉以輔助消化。非至必不得已時。概不御車。其儉樸之風。亦可以為法矣。</p>
<p>劉氏之所以能享高齡。且其嗓音老而彌佳者。此亦有其主因在也。（一）彼平素不親女色。常盤膝靜坐或讀經閱書以自遣。（二）彼每於曲終入後台時。必急以熱毛巾折疊後罩於頂上。額際亦均遮起。一人仰臥沙發上。約一刻餘鐘。迨全身及面部熱汗完全浸乾後。始行洗面更衣。離去後台。常其閉目休憇之時。無論何人均不得向其談話。或起閉鬥窗。以免寒風內侵也。大鼓書之習慣皆係先慢後快愈唱愈急。雖靑年人歌此。亦必力竭聲嘶。惟寳全則如長江大河。一瀉千里。字宇均能打入聽衆耳鼓。唯共如是。故一曲甫終。即遍體盡濕。倘不作充分之休息。將汗乾透。則風邪一入毛孔。必患感買及咳嗽諸症。途致影響嗓音之圓潤。此雖小節。然劉氏能持之以恒。數十年從不稍變。故其令譽乃能持之永久耳。</p>
<h3>劉寳全彈唱時之神情</h3>
<h3>故宮影展觀感記</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>鼓都風光，憧憧心頭者垂二十年矣，苦為事牽，迄未能一攬其勝，徒呼負負。蘆溝橋七七事變之前一月，老友李子新甫，有故都之遊，堅的偕行，予以職務覊身，欲行不得，卒婉謝之。比李子返而戰禍作，故都旋吿淪陷，予益為之懊喪不置。吾友丁虹博士，適亦於戰前往遊，攝得影片數百幀而返，一若於其彌留之前，為攝遺影也者，噫，可恫也！日者海上收藏家，為籌措醫藥經費而舉行歷代書畫展，成績斐然。丁博士痼癏在抱，因亦繼起舉行故宮攝影展覽會，選其最精者一百餘點，一一放大，陳之會塲。咋往觀光，覺其攝影藝術，巳臻爐火純靑之候，而使人於流連光景之餘，油然而起光復故土之念，則其意義亦殊深長也。（附以人像與國外景物六十餘點，亦足資觀賞。）中如天壇，玉闌十二層，畫棟雕梁，九龍壁，皇穹宇，　廊諸點，具見吾國前代之建築美，而太和殿，祈年殿，法輪殿，雍和宮，故宮斜陽，明思宗殉國處諸點，則弔古傷今，令人低徊不盡。其有如予之未獲一遊故都者，則厠身其間，彷彿蠟屐親臨，誠足為臥遊之好資料也。觀罷歸來，感不絕於予心，因賦二絕句以示丁博士：</p>
<p>十萬貔貅一夕空，蘆溝橋上血殷紅，河山信美非吾土，熱淚潺湲弔故宮。</p>
<p>北望燕雲黯碧穹，彌天刦火泣哀鴻，前塵夢影從頭記，盪氣　腸說故宮。</p>
<h3>蒨蒨室劇話（下）</h3>
<p>— 張肖傖</p>
<p>談瓊林宴之技巧</p>
<p>余叔岩唱瓊林宴，是他認為生平傑作之一，凡是到各處打泡，無不拿這齣戲與台下相見，他也有兩種特點：一種是問樵一塲，問明樵夫巳得妻兒下落之後，卽行入塲，待樵夫再喚他回來時，叔岩從下塲門出來的一種似瘋似顚而不大情願回來的神氣，直逼老譚，好極好極。還有一特點，我現在要說明，老譚的掛箱，是隨隨便便之中出箱的，小余便不然，是身在箱中而用頭頸枕在箱口之一端，又用脚枕在箱口之一端，運用全身力氣把身體伸直，再從箱口滾落台上，這一點與老譚大不相同。此種工夫，現在呌馬連良譚富英楊寳森來這一手，恐怕都吃不消。拿技巧來講，不能不說是小余的工夫，但是把當時的情理來講，范仲禹受傷昏厥之後，醒轉過來，決不致有這種氣力表演如小余的樣子吧。所以我對於小余的出箱，是稱許他的技巧，而不贊成他的劇情，不過話須說回來，老譚在鬧府一塲之丟鞋子落頭頂一層，也不是戲情所必有的，與小余的出箱，同一祗可說技巧而不能談情理的。</p>
<p>老譚的丟鞋子落頭頂，今人以為是老譚百發百中的絕技，實在並不如此，我所見的三决，其中一次，是老譚看見鞋子丟得甚有把握，聲色不動的聽其鞋子落在頭上。一次是丟得不甚得法，就用手在頭頂之上，接住了。一次是恐怕鞋子落地，用手伸在頭上，及鞋子將近頭頂，把手縮下，聽鞋子落到頭頂的。可見老譚自己並沒有十分把握，也可以曉得他對於此道，是練得純熟的了。</p>

<h3>會審張輔泉案邑尊拂袖而起</h3>
<p>（見遜清同治十一年四月份本報）</p>
<p>張輔泉為孫阿助扭縣控吿一案，因張某為洋人用人，應得公堂會訊；是以道憲按照舊章，飭委陳司馬會同葉邑尊、領事、翻譯會審：先提當日幫扭之李隆貴等三名，葉邑尊將有訊詰，西官禁使勿言，葉邑尊謂：「旣不欲我一言訊詰，何以謂之會審，且又何必會審乎。」拂衣而起，階下候審者，見邑尊入內，亦皆一鬨欲散，洋巡捕頭急令閉門，陳司馬一面安西官之心，一面服邑尊之禮，於是復登公堂。訊明張輔泉不應悮信妓館幫工之婦，恃勢兇橫，將孫阿助私穽，實屬大干禁例；而孫阿助與張輔泉挾有微嫌，輙於租界地方，糾人强拉，亦未免有不合處。於是定讞，原被各與監禁六月，以儆凶頑，共餘幫同拖拉之李隆貴等，罪已歸於首，各枷號五日，以示薄懲。當訊問時，有一短髮長衫，口稱小的之人，徑上公堂，屹然不跪，云係為張輔泉作見證者。陳司馬招之近前，問其何事，其人欲有所言；乃孫阿助在下叱曰：「此一隻烏龜也，乃何敢立於公案之旁乎。」看審之人，均為忍俊不禁。（按張輔泉者，本是無賴之徒，作惡多端，經西人使用之後，更肆無忌憚矣。當其犯法干禁之時，以為西人足以護身，不知是非自有公論，西人亦斷不能袒護也。）</p>

<h3>金融　預料希特勒演辭溫和　現金價繼續向榮　終以外銀行不絕地供塞　在港幫買勢下止漲稍回</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、繼續向榮、蓋承上日之餘風且大眾生漸信今日希特勒之演說、對歐洲時局之軸心、無所影響、因之一般殷富收藏儲心思復濃、紛托錢兌業爭前吸收、故晨間遂昂達二千零八十兀高峯、嗣後雖錢兌業續來吸購、兼某銀樓（代香港幫）亦跟蹤購買、但以銀樓幫暨金號趁高脫售、加以某銀號代外銀行續來供塞、漲風遂　、漸呈盤旋局勢、結果續漲五元半、惟中途起落范圍、依然平庸、各方人心穩定、交易稍旺、約七百十兩、銀樓飾金掛大一元、海關金仍平、中英純金等復向上升、</p>
<p>烚赤再漲五元半</p>

<h3>中國布應用中國紗　華廠紗有似獄中囚　日廠紗乃如出柙虎　囤積居奇無補國產　漲風重見為因多端</h3>
<p>久疲不振之紗市、前昨兩日忽又狂漲、此其故、固由於捷報頻傳、人心振奮、勝利日期、相接愈近、因之日鈔狂跌、偽幣大落、津幫之持有日偽鈔者、轉向上海日廠大買其紗布、於是日本紗布頗見昂騰、華廠出品、求之愈切、茲擦索其漲因所在、</p>
<p>一　本年以十支粗紗及三十二支單紗四十二支雙股綫價、與二十支紗差額日見接近、有一部份紗廠視粗紗利潤既厚銷路又俏、有將錠子稍為改變、而廠方所有期貨、早被北方天津幫預定搜羅殆盡、同時寗波和豐廠專紡粗紗、自封江以後、來源中斷、直至昨日始由恩德輪裝來一千二百包、但亦無濟於事、</p>
<p>二　在前月中、華廠紡製四支五支六支八支紗之數量殊巨、據調查所得、約有五六萬包、交貨期現已開到五六七八九月為止、據云、此項棉紗、廠方利息較他紗為雄、然紗商之盈利更豐、</p>
<p>三　邇來日紗步步飛漲、大有扶搖直上之勢、查其原因、一則在青島取引中拋空者、吃了大虧、於是轉向滬上、不問一切、窮拖濫進、二則為華北日偽貨幣下降、買者又在滬上大買日紗、因此在二三星期中、橫跳三四十元之譜、二十支藍鳳水月、見戰後之新高峯、據聞此次上海幫吃　殊鉅、盈利者少、津青幫得利滿載而歸矣、</p>
<p>四　日紗猛騰之後、影響及於華紗、天津北洋恒源兩華廠之紗、向被日紗排擠於市場之外、止得南運謀出路、豈料近來與日紗比較、該紗大為便宜、（售價全係匯劃價）晤中更為合算、於是天津幫、心意靈敏、將二十支三　八仙十七支三　等紗、紛紛收進、裝回老家去、經其一掠之後、市價當然趨緊矣、</p>
<p>五　就以上情況論之、二十支本紗價格為最廉、一般投機商目標注重於此、至殷富者復來囤藏、故在最近以來、浙東甌江雖自動封鎖、輪運停駛、南方閩海日艦　集、紛擾不休、紗布疋頭一律止裝止辦、依然未遭打擊、反能站在穩定之境、在四百元關口、屢進屢退、為時甚久、前昨兩日又突發漲風、</p>
<p>六　內地廣西幫、久已不辦、近則需要稍起、且專辦二十支雙馬為大宗、天女特金城次之、於是　積已久之二十支、今得實際交易扶植、乃發生激烈之飛騰、一般投機商在市播放空氣、推波助瀾、愈形劇烈、不過實銷固暢、現貨一時不敷供求、當然上升、然漲力過強、又礙實銷發展也、至二十支中身貨、即新創紗廠之出品、價格既廉十餘元、銷路仍滯而不活潑也、據業中人云、二十支紗前途或仍有趨昂可能性、因日紗價昂、內地幫改辦華英需用、圖利為厚、大眾心理須觀四百二十元、不過十支粗紗價上身貨已達三百五十元、在比較方面著想、不能說其廉宜矣、但他廠不紡、北路有需要、然查其該幫買去之數量及同行中之開進額量、亦屬不少、</p>
<p>上漲之原因如是、但求其實際、恐有未許樂觀、據聞中國紗為一般投機商及殷富儲藏於堆棧中、有八萬包之巨、擱殺雄厚之資財、掀起投機之漲風、擴大日紗之銷路、加重國布之成本、此皆囤戶祇顧私利、使中國紗頓似獄中之囚犯、日本紗乃如出柙之虎兒、若不改圖、將使華廠之紗、永不能適過日紗、織布廠家、專銷日紗、則所織之布、焉得謂之國布、中國商人果知利害輕重、應使中國布廠用中國紗、方為大利所在、無以囤積居奇為能也、</p>
<h3>美棉內消有津貼說　本埠印棉至貨日旺　火機花昨下跌五角</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初較為靜寂、後因各方對於美棉出口津貼者日見增多、昨日有傳說政府因各方反對出口津貼殊烈、擬先實行國內消棉津貼、俟成功後、再行出口津貼、因之引起空頭抵補、銀行界及同業羣起購買、結果棉價激漲十一磅音、昨日印度漲三羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、利物浦現貨猛漲十磅音、折合法幣、計美棉漲一元、印棉漲一元二角、埃及漲二元、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、近日來雖紗價步高、而各廠未見大量訂購、昨日又以外棉價格過高、各廠均無交易聞、近日外棉到貨甚多、前各花號所訂之白洛區亦已相繼到滬、故各廠若有缺貨、亦可隨時向花號方面配購現貨、尚屬便利也、茲將昨日棉市折合送廠價錄下、</p>
<p>本棉生意、依然稀少、售價稍挫、火機花下跌半元、廠需甚滯、實緣各廠購訂之外棉、業已源源抵滬、廠方需用不虞斷之、所以對於本棉交易、殊見清澹、然各路來源仍中斷、下降程度迂緩也、棉市根本問題、無精采可言、蘇北至通花僅一百九十八包、浙棉由恩德輪船抵滬、帶來六千三百餘件、又今日出口有六十件棉花運汕頭、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<h3>疋頭　避免『偽鈔』暴跌損失　津商在滬改囤布疋　東疋因之迭創新價　染廠擇廉采用國布</h3>
<p>國布　許棉紗東疋　漲風更　、人心激昂、質地較優之細布如大鵬·富貴·砲車·明魚·各牌、以現市較東胥廉宜、適合染坯用途、故各染廠亟起采用、某銀行自運昆明銷售大鵬·富貴等牌細布、刻以需額未足、廠盤提高、乃積極向同業搜集、市上貨底空虛、售盤晨市每疋漲五分、午後又漲一角、成交細布一百餘包、蘇北及粵閩幫辦一百包、細斜廠盤漲二三角、染廠以需要不濃、售盤雖增、實際交易尚寡、僅粵幫辦下檔愛字等牌五六十包、怡和粗布市面亦緊、廉額手貨經同業連續搜羅後、漸漸稀少、大生振中廠十六磅貨漲價一角、各華廠十一磅·九磅貨漲價五分、由本街及囤戶吸進二百餘包、漂染布胥以坯布步昂、售價亦一再上騰、新成交難以談洽、西南川滇粵幫預定各種色布·色斜·漂布·府綢·條漂布積極裝運、均係便宜額子、本街出貨亦什九出取定貨坯布及製成品、游擊區以蚌埠幫需胃最濃、以色布色斜為大宗、逐日有數千疋運往、</p>
<p>東布　白貨因北幫　繼續旺辦、細布·細斜·迭見高峰、昨十二磅彩球細布下月份已售開每疋十四元、現貨為十三元八角、其餘各牌如龍頭·陽鶴·雙魚·飛魚·藍鷄·喇叭·等一致飛騰、俱創新盤、期貨較現貨、每疋均各提升二角至二角半、天津幫采辦尤鉅、猛進各牌細布·細斜有二千件之譜、青島幫亦進辦千件左右、本街同業染坯去路亦近千件、洋行訂開下月份期貨細布一千七八百件、細斜缺額、竟至無貨可售、市勢之俏、實所罕見、據聞天津偽『聯銀劵』暴跌、人心搖動、津商浮資過多、為防免損失計、故皆在滬囤貨、近日辦胃雖旺、實際北裝之貨、並不見多、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭今日（二十八）出口、計有一百十四件運青島、一百六十五件運天津、二十五件運廈門、五十五件運汕頭、三百六十件運香港、</p>
<h3>糧食　本粉客銷不寂　售盤高定次堅</h3>
<p>廠粉　昨日本廠現給予交易尚旺、客幫經連日活動後、雖少整批交易、而零星去化不弱、蓋北洋幫以天津匯水上落太巨、均不敢大量采取、惟對於次檔粉進胃尤佳、南洋幫零銷亦盛、統市成交五六萬包、其中有一部份三四號粉售價、反為堅挺、乃目下各廠存產兩少之故也、二號粉本客一律仍為四元四角半原盤、次檔雜牌略有參差、市面正在醞釀中、查麺粉出口、今日有八千包運天津、又五千八百包運廈門、又二萬二千包運汕頭、又　皮五百包運香港、</p>
<p>洋粉　昨市平穩、新到貨暫告缺乏、市上流通貨仍少、本客交易均清、故中檔牌子仍守四元四角半匯劃、與本粉廠盤並道而馳、</p>
<p>小麥　昨交易仍淡、粉廠定麥、已有新到一船、對於本麥需要更不貪取、聞近日新到之京鎮等麥、大都直接送廠或配銷某方收去、價為六元八角左右、但市上喊價仍須七元光景、正市雖無做開、暗市已趨鬆疾矣、</p>
<h3>油餅　生豆油昨祇皮球交易　到貨不絕　行情下降</h3>
<p>昨日生豆油、晨初承上日之餘威、且盛傳日本有需用外匯之說、故市氣頗覺堅硬、但入後因到貨源源不絕、實銷又不起、市場中祇有踢皮球交易、致操縱手段無從實現、行情一致下降瀉、計先開路貨膠州生油五十件、價為三十八元二角、現貨成交二百件、價為三十九元三角、膠州豆油四十件、價為三十三元五角、大連現豆油二百桶、價自四十七元五角、續跌至四十六元五角、連歧大簍做開一百件、價為四十四元五角、</p>
<p>豆子二十七日出口、運香港三百七十九包、運廈門二百三十包、</p>
<h3>進出口　恩德輪運麥赴南　裝來花紗黃酒</h3>
<p>本月五日、鎮海日本令禁止船隻出入後、滬甬航綫遂告中斷、貨運因之停頓、茲悉前中意公司恩德輪在滬承裝德商太豐麺粉廠之洋麥一萬六千五百包赴甬、得軍事機關之批準、於十八日駛甬、卸清後於昨晨返滬、該輪在甬得軍事機關允許、計裝來貨二萬一千三百餘件、內棉花六千零七十餘件、木機花二百七十五件、棉紗一千二百件、鮮蛋四千六百二十件、黃酒三千零三十件、土紙五千一百餘件、此外均為草帽、草蓆等雜貨、及綢子一百二十五件、</p>
<p>又昨日煙葉有一千零六十六噸、由紐約運來、今（二十八日）有土紙二百三十件、運往青島、</p>
<h3>來函　大有餘餅之原料　油廠公會來函聲明</h3>

<h3>潤腸食品</h3>
<p>— 曹錫萬</p>
<p>便秘一癥，有關人體康健，至重且巨。患者除精神常感不舒外，甚有引起其他病癥之虞。療治之法，首當分別輕重，重者仁麻仁之屬。然前者性太猛烈，有尅伐正氣之弊，後者性雖和緩，而含油質太重，亦碍胃氣。故上述　種，對於體弱胃虛，習慣性便閉，及有阿芙蓉癖之腸燥者，均非所宜。惟蜂蜜天花粉一物，性味和平，而對於潤導之功頗著。茲分述如下。</p>
<p>蜂蜜　其味甘和而無毒，功能益氣補中，滋養脾胃，調和營衡，滋潤臟腑，古法之蜜煎導，（此物靈極）即以蜜提煉而成，其潤導之有功，不言可知。然上述數種，皆為外用，若改為內服，對於高年體　，及習慣性便閉等慢性病患者，頗為合宜，且其味甘芳可口，而無傷正敗胃之弊，惟市上純粹之品甚少，購時加注意。（服法）每日三次，每次一匙，食後一二小時用開水沖服，或參入其他食料中，服之亦佳。</p>
<p>天花粉（即括藥根）為根莖類植物，其形與薯芋相似，味甘平略酸，性微苦微寒，論其效用，方書所載頗多，惟主要功能，不外生津止渴，潤燥養胃，潤導通便，其功不亞於蜂蜜。此物產地，以嘉定為最著，故佳者稱為嘉定天花粉。出品分藥用食用二種。藥用者，由泥中取出，洗淨，去皮，切片，即可入藥。食用者，洗淨去皮之後，須即入臼，搗汁，去渣，待汁沉澱，晒乾，研細成粉，然後可供食用。此種天花粉，常服之後，對於體虛胃弱，及慢性便閉，頗有效益。如慾嘗試，可向南貨店詢購，服法與藕粉同。</p>
<h3>白帶食治</h3>
<p>— 鄒德民</p>
<p>白帶幾為婦人通病，其病原則都有濕熱下注，氣虛不攝；或因房事過度，子宮內有粘膩狀物，如黃膿，如魚腦，如血液者，由生殖器內流出。濁熱素盛者，其氣臭穢。日久形容憔悴，腰痛背　，腦力衰弱，記憶減退甚至影響月經，妨礙生育，而入未老先衰之狀，誠婦女界最纏綿之惡症者也。</p>
<p>白帶質量亦有多寡，少者固無碍健康，多者即為病象，中西醫治療此症，僅能使之減少，而皆無澈底辦法，蓋調治雖有賴於醫藥，然一面尤須自知攝養，戒思慮，節房勞，皆為當務之急。今有長期食養一法，堪為患者告：方用茨實苡仁各一兩，熟地五錢，紅栆十枚，每日燉食，作為點心亦可，既經濟，又簡便，常服數月，收效必著。蓋茨實苡仁功能固　，又為滲濕之品，熟地紅栆，乃補血健脾之物，故食後與病體殊有裨益也。</p>
<h3>形態色澤常之痧子　症情順逆與飲食宜忌</h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>痧子之正常者，能自然透達，助以藥力，發疹較易，發熱後之三四日，即能透達於外。先見於耳之前後，前額，口圍等處，遂漸向下體蔓延。此疹在皮膚上之位置，恒與毛孔一致，即先於毛孔發生圓形之小結節，次由小結節之固　，漸發一紅暈，此紅暈恒較附近之皮膚稍稍隆起，故以手撫之，可覺發疹部之皮膚，不及康健皮膚之平滑，合小結節與紅暈，乃成一類圓形之痧疹，其大小約與麻仁相似，故又稱之曰麻疹。</p>
<p>吾人之毛孔，無據慮千萬，而痧子之透發，並不舉所有之毛孔而盡發之；聞亦有一部之毛孔，痧疹齊透者，則必密集成片，造成異常之形態。蓋吳人之各毛孔，距離甚近，遍發而無隙處，則痧疹連接為一，成斑成塊，其小而顏色正常者，尚無大妨，若一片平坦，或綿紋斑爛，恍若遍體赤霞，內熱已甚，每有痙厥之處、治療之法，偏於清解，石膏，元參，連翹，天花粉，知母，麥冬，黃苓，葛根等，皆可隨證施用；故飲料亦宜清涼，　根，紅皮蔗，橘子汁，或銀花露，青蒿露，皆可與服。本症熱甚之由來，與腸胃積滯，不無關係，故食物宜禁止，否則如火添油，如沸加薪，其勢將反增劇也。又有一種如水泡之痧疹，其證狀為心胸煩悶，嘔吐清水，身溫熱。由於患者血行障礙，或飲食不節，處理失宜，胸滿腹脹，緊逼血絡，即血中之水分，往往透過血管，滲於痧疹之中，成為水泡狀。因其熱度甚高，亦以清熱為主，另加貫仲，防風，芥穗；如由於飲食不節者，則以消導為主，　內金，萊菔子，山查炭，橘皮，　牙，為必需之品。</p>
<p>痧子與痘，病原不同，辦症亦各異，即以色澤而論，其診斷方法，大不相同，大抵痘怕大紅，皮嫩易破，必生瘙癢；痧疹之色，最喜通紅，色之紅者，毒得盡發，乃為正兆、如精神不振，疹子之色淡白而不鮮紅者，乃心血不足，不早治療，急者成為痙症，慢者延為　癆。藥治以當歸，地黃，紅花，陳皮等益血活血為主、食療方面，赤豆加生姜，煎湯服，尚能中肯，惟袛可啜湯，赤豆與沈澄物，宜棄去。如顏色過紅，兼見大便閉結，唇口赤燥，此實火內　，大熱症也。此時胃納不開，十五食物方面，已無探討之必要，清涼飲料，多服亦無妨。若不早治，則內熱極而出血，痧疹由紫而黑，難於救治，飲料方面，橘汁宜多服，綠豆衣煎湯冷飲，或金銀花露服之亦可；然杯水車薪，實不足以遏其炎炎之勢，投大劑犀角地黃，或始有挽救之望。</p>
<h3>胃氣病</h3>
<p>— 顧宗文</p>
<p>胃氣痛一病，或因　怒而起，或由煙酒過度，以致脾胃失常，而有脘腹脹痛，噯氣，反噁，吐酸，不能飲食，食則更痛等症，此即西醫所謂「胃酸過多症」是也。近之患胃氣病者每服小蘇打，服後確可止痛，但不久即復發，蓋小蘇打一物，含有　性作用，服後則與分泌過量之胃酸起中和作用，故能立止疼痛。然稍過數日，胃酸又多，則痛復作矣。欲求澈底治療，必須先藉藥石之力　其肝，開其　，使肝胃和，則病自霍然。但一面又須患者自知攝生，並注意食餌療養，始可永不復發。</p>
<p>禁止一切雜食，為胃氣痛患者首須注意之事，即每日正當之食量，亦宜減少，每次最多食二小碗，　食物能完全消化而盡得其營養，切勿任意過食，復損脾胃。且胃部既弱，當然不能消化堅硬之食物，故宜食稀飯，如有焦米稀飯更佳，因其味較香，可開胃口，且經炒焦之後，易於消化，但此稀飯亦不可過薄，因含水太多，易使胃酸上泛也。至於平日所食之蔬菜，以豆類及豆腐衣，豆腐皮之屬，總以含有鹼性之食物為佳，一切含有刺激性，及酸辣生冷之食物，務須絕對禁絕。平日可以佛手，或代代花，泡水代茶，以暢胸腹，入市經數月或半年之後。脾胃漸復，食量亦增，乃可食飯及稍疏禁忌，但尚不宜過於　怒或憂慮，庶不致前功盡毀也。</p>
<p>少吃多滋味，多吃壞肚皮：揀吃補生理，濫吃傷身體。</p>
<h3>煎藥</h3>
<p>— 張羅</p>
<p>煎藥一事，病家往往忽視，然若煎之不得其法，藥力便易消失，且傭僕代煎，實有加以指導之必要。</p>
<p>大凡病內傷者，藥宜用微火，久煎，蓋其中多培補正氣之品，若少煎則藥力不得使出。病外感者，則宜用急火一滾即可，不應多煎，蓋其藥多芳香透達，久則過性而失其功效。如遇方中用丸散及枇杷棄旋覆花等者，俱應包煎，使湯藥不致過於渾濁，難以入口，並防微毛嗆入喉中。便有元明粉芒硝等，均宜煮後去渣，須淨，羚羊，沉香末等，亦不可納入他藥共煎，而應沖服，西洋參人參等則應另煎沖服，以免藥汁耗費。其他如「先煮」「後下」等藥，亦不可不注意及之：如龍骨，牡蠣等，質地堅實者，其藥味煎出非易，均當先煮而後納人他藥同煎；而薄荷砂仁蒄仁　香佩蘭芳香之藥，則宜後下，俟一沸即起火。筆者以為當醫生處方時必須詳註，病家必須遵照，庶幾事半功倍矣。</p>
<h3>食鹽</h3>
<p>— 丁時乘</p>
<p>食鹽為人類必需品之一，除調味醃臘外，尚可用以療治各種疼痛病。如患足根痛，骨節痛，神經痛等症，可用食鹽一二斤，滾水一大壺泡湯，俟溫熱適度，將痛之部分乘熱浸入，至水涼而後止，如是每日行之，少則二月，多則三月，其病自愈。如痛在胃部，或其他部分不能侵水者，可將食鹽炒熱，用白布紮緊，除徐熨擦痛處，俟冷即重行炒熱（一人炒，一人擦，）熨之，旅途遇雪，步行數里，始得遇船，已一盡夜未換潮濕鞋襪，不數月即患膝蓋　痛症，是底軟綿，步履維艱，苦痛無已，服藥數月餘，均未根除，逢節氣及陰天，往往作痛。後山同學某君教以一法。即用洋鉛桶二隻，徑可五寸，高過膝一二寸，注熱鹽湯於其中，每夜浸一二小時，未會間斷，浸時覺全身蒸發，涔涔汗出，非常舒適，睡眠亦安，不兩月，果霍然而愈，至今已逾四年，從未復發。其功效誠不　可思議矣。</p>
<h3>飴糖</h3>
<p>— 張汝偉</p>
<p>飴糖（即麥精）甘溫補中。甯粘凝滑潤之性，以糯米煎熬者良，凡中氣虛弱，腹痛不和，面黃肌削，大便　泄，咳嗽音啞者，服之均妙。中國自古已用之，仲景小建中湯，即以此物為主，因原方為桂枝加芍藥湯，加一味飴糖，即改名建中，若去飴糖，而加黃芪，即名黃芪　物湯。可知飴糖為建中之主藥，非佐使之品也。因益氣養血有利中守化之巧，千金酥蜜膏，亦用飴糖為君，主治氣竭聲嘶之症。今海上飴糖，頗難購到，宜訪購之。</p>
<h3>談談牛乳下</h3>
<p>— 丁濟民</p>
<p>中國人千年來沒有吃過這個牛乳，一旦初吃這個又甜又膩又腥（有人說香）的牛乳，當然不免有人發生反應，甚則便秘，或胃部不舒，口臭，腹瀉的了。所以牛乳的性質，據我的觀察，亦和孫氏一樣，性平，沒有什麽熱和寒的性質。有的是對於中國人的胃口慣不慣的問題。所以熱者以上為熱，寒者以上為寒，　是各人的反應。</p>
<p>關於牛乳性寒性熱，及其滋養力的問題，於此可得一結論：就是慣的人，盡可吃吃，不慣的人，不妨不吃。下面要講到牛乳對於病人的營養價值了。</p>
<p>在古代，我們拿牛乳來治病的方劑也很多，其中有一張呌韭汁牛乳飲。是專治噎膈反胃的。另有一張呌五汁飲，是用牛乳六份，韭安藕黎汁各一份，也是同樣的功用。噎膈反胃，多數是食過生了東西，乾的食糧，曣不下去，當然要吐出來了。上面的兩張方劑，可收滋養潤澤，及待期治療之功。證以近代的營養學，亦是很合理的。</p>
<p>許多氣體衰弱和換著慢性病的人，牛乳卻可以吃；除了不慣（亦許吃吃可慣）的人之外。</p>
<p>平常的人。每天吃牛乳，確可似孫思邈所說的，補血脈益心，長肌肉。身體康強潤澤，面目光悅，志氣不衰。然而必須附合他說的條件：「一日弗　，當使恣意充足」。（完）</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Within Nanchang City; Fengxin Also Surrounded by Chinese Forces; Baishi Ridge, Gaoyou City, Xiangfu Temple All Captured by the Chinese Side; Foreign Reports Claim Nanchang City and the Japanese Airfield Have Also Been Completely Recovered; Chinese Forces in the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Border Area Launch a Three-Pronged Counteroffensive with Smooth Progress</h3>
<p>Zhangshu: Fengxin City has been surrounded on three sides by Chinese forces. Yesterday morning, over a thousand Japanese soldiers, along with more than ten tanks, launched a counteroffensive against the Chinese forces. The fierce fighting lasted until around 10 a.m., with five tanks destroyed by the Chinese army. The Japanese soldiers fled back into the city. This morning, the Japanese army reinforced with over a thousand additional soldiers and sixteen tanks, launching another counteroffensive against the Chinese forces. The fighting is still ongoing. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: Chinese soldiers who stormed into the Nanchang airfield engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese, advancing and retreating several times, killing three to four hundred Japanese soldiers. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Chinese army launched an offensive with three major units attacking Tongcheng, Chongyang, and Yueyang. After a day and night of bloody fighting, significant progress has been made on all fronts. A certain Chinese division attacking Yueyang has approached Xinqiang, and the Japanese army shows signs of retreat. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Several hundred Jiangxi Chinese guerrillas stormed into Nanchang yesterday afternoon, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army captured Phoenix Mountain west of Fengxin and is besieging the city. The Chinese army has occupied Xiliang Mountain near Liangjiadu. The Japanese army counterattacked Gaoan, and the Chinese army dispatched troops to intercept them. The Chinese army in southern Hubei launched a fierce attack on Chongyang, and the Japanese are collapsing towards Xianning. The fighting at Nanlin Bridge in Baini Bridge is still fierce. The Japanese army in Yueyang has been continuously reinforced with three thousand men in recent days. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received here today from the Chinese front lines, after a large-scale counteroffensive by the Chinese army, they have already recovered the key Jiangxi fortress of Nanchang. According to earlier Chinese reports, the Chinese army attacked Nanchang on April 24th, breaking through the Japanese defense lines. Fierce street fighting is still ongoing between both sides. A Chinese person said that the city is burning, and corpses block the roads. The Chinese army advanced towards Nanchang after occupying Liantang. When the Chinese army attacked Nanchang, the Japanese army transferred their garrison in Liantang to strengthen the defense on the Nanchang side. Therefore, the Japanese force in Liantang was extremely weak, and the Chinese army took the opportunity to attack, reportedly annihilating the remaining Japanese troops. The Chinese army in Nanchang had infiltrated the Japanese airfield and engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. After several fierce battles, Nanchang itself and the airfield have been completely occupied by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops are retreating northward. (26th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese reports, the Chinese army has recovered Baishi Ridge, located three miles northeast of Gaoan (Baishi Ridge is 30 miles west of Nanchang). Eight hundred Chinese soldiers are using Baishi Ridge as a base, attempting to cut off the Japanese retreat route from Gaoan. According to Chinese reports from Yichang, in the past week, the Japanese army transported 10,000 corpses from Nanchang to Jiujiang for cremation. (27th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: On the morning of the 26th, a certain Chinese army advanced towards the Japanese army in Jing'an and has now approached the city suburbs, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese. Gan Shujiaji, outside Jing'an city, was originally garrisoned by over two hundred Japanese soldiers. On the morning of the 27th, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack, killing more than half of the Japanese soldiers. The remnants fled into the city. (27th dispatch)</p>

<h3>The European Situation and Japan's Dilemma</h3>
<p>This newspaper published a Reuters dispatch yesterday, which stated that two British newspapers reported the following:</p>
<p>The Times of London Tokyo dispatch stated: "The ongoing internal deliberation within the Japanese government is of utmost importance. It remains undecided on what course to take. No matter what encouraging words Hitler may deliver in the German Reichstag on Friday, it cannot be said that Japan is willing to fight for the Axis powers in the Pacific. This situation, as well as the future of the Japanese cabinet, is now very delicate."</p>
<p>The Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent stated: "Italian Foreign Minister Ciano was originally scheduled to visit Berlin, but there is no news of when he will depart. This is probably a symbol that the negotiations to turn the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance have broken down. According to informed sources in Rome, Ciano has now canceled his plan to attend the German Reichstag to listen to Hitler's speech. Japan's hesitation is due to its naval authorities being wary of President Roosevelt's order to concentrate the US fleet in the Pacific. However, Hitler is still making a final effort to get the Japanese government to change its attitude."</p>
<p>The reports from the two newspapers are complex and interwoven. They involve a wide range of issues and have far-reaching implications. They represent a panoramic view of the entire world problem, a great mystery of which even a hair's breadth can lead to a distance of a thousand miles, and its true nature is unfathomable. The severity and complexity of the problem are such that no force can control its evolution, nor can any wisdom grasp its future. Those involved in the problem can only bury their heads and strive to strengthen their own position in order to achieve a more favorable outcome; otherwise, they can only observe the course of events. To predict fortune or misfortune today is pointless. However, some general remarks can be made: Aggressors, insatiable in their greed, will ultimately encounter resistance and collapse. Japan will inevitably be defeated in the Far East, and Germany and Italy will inevitably be defeated in Europe. If Germany, Italy, and Japan collude, they will ultimately perish together. The speed of destruction is difficult to predict, but the stronger the attitudes of the Soviet Union and the United States, the faster the anti-aggression front will prevail.</p>
<p>A mystery is a mystery because the problem, from beginning to end, will be divided into an unknown number of stages. Each stage has its own set of divergent paths. Each path must have an end, but we do not know where it will end, nor do we know the form of its end. Taking the most recent stage as an example: Germany and Italy's actions in Europe, encompassing and swallowing everything, seem to have no end in sight, but President Roosevelt's telegram of appeal suddenly caused a setback, forming a historical stage. Now, the reply that German leader Hitler will give tonight is a representation of both the past and the future, and the beginning of a new stage. There are many possible ways to unfold the new stage: Overtly rejecting peace proposals while covertly stopping acts of aggression, allowing time to pass and flexibility to maneuver, thus followed by various international negotiations for division of spoils and price negotiations, this is Method One; outwardly acting evasively while competing to expand strength, looking left and right, taking advantage of opportunities, continuing their lives of cunning seizure, this is Method Two; replying with sarcasm, drawing swords and stretching bows, revealing the hidden agenda, engaging in close combat, this is Method Three. These are the three general possibilities. If it involves entering and exiting, capturing and releasing, moving deftly through time and space, then there are many possible ways, not confined to one pattern. However, these various possibilities also become different premises that affect the Far East. Only with different premises can we not determine what role Japan will play in the drama. Moreover, as reported by The Times of London, Japan is still pondering the matter fundamentally and does not know what course to take. To put it another way: If Germany and Italy advance, will Japan advance with them, resist them, or stay away from them? If Germany and Italy hesitate, will Japan encourage them or hinder them? If Germany and Italy advocate peace, will Japan advocate war, take it as an opportunity to "step down" in the Far East, or advocate peace in Europe but war in the Far East? What is meant by peace - peace with Britain and the United States, peace with the Soviet Union, peace with the Republic of China? What is meant by war - war in the Indian Ocean, war in the Pacific, or war on the coast of the East Sea and between the shores of Lake Baikal? Japan's "not knowing what course to take" is such that there is no way to foresee the end of the problem.</p>
<p>We have previously argued that the German-Italian Axis called for anti-communism to attract Japan as a partner. Since Japan's invasion of China, encountering resistance and almost exhausting its strength, Germany and Italy should have realized the uselessness of this partner, and Japan must also know that it is of no benefit to Germany and Italy. So it goes, with their so-called anti-communism as the theme. As the situation shifts, what they call for becomes more and more false, and they stray further and further from the theme. Thus, what Germany and Italy want to use their partner for lies elsewhere - since they are not actually engaged in anti-communism, they do not need to attack the Soviet Union from both ends of Eurasia, but rather to supplement Germany and Italy's absolutely insufficient navy. Indeed, while it may be contemptible to attack the Soviet Union in the name of anti-communism with this lame friend bogged down in China, at sea, Japan is one of the three strongest powers in the world. It is not without reason that German leader Hitler is still making a final effort for Japan. Japan knows this; why would they use the navy they built with decades of hard work as a tool for Germany and Italy? The combined total of the navies of Japan, Germany, and Italy is not enough to match Britain and France. The smaller European countries that side with Britain and France also have their own minimum number of warships. So, what is Japan's navy fighting for if it cannot win? Furthermore, the US fleet is watching from behind, ready to strike at any time. Japan knows this, yet it still hesitates and does not firmly reject Germany and Italy. There is no other reason than that China has confidence in ultimate victory, while even the most stubborn Japanese no longer have confidence in victory today. The deeper they sink, the harder it is to pull themselves out. However, they have the notion that the turmoil in Europe is an opportunity for Japan to extricate itself. What they are hesitating about is how to participate in the European turmoil to help them extricate themselves. Going against the tide and making a desperate gamble cannot lead to extrication; it only hastens their demise.</p>

<h3>Outline of Battlefield Propaganda Made by the Military Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) (Continued from the previous section) (10) Propagate the fact that the enemy can only control the points and lines in the areas "occupied" by the Japanese invaders, and that most of the rest of the country is still under our control, so that the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines believe that as long as we work hard, the enemy's power will shrink even further. (11) Propagate the enemy's indiscriminate use of poison gas on the front lines to slaughter our heroic soldiers, the enemy's massacre of our people in the war zone, the burning of our homes, rape, and plunder, and the indiscriminate bombing of our undefended cities in the rear, deliberately destroying our charitable cultural institutions, etc., in order to arouse the hatred of the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines. (12) In the war zone, it is especially necessary to expose the enemy's various conspiracies and deceptive propaganda, expose the sinister intentions of the enemy's petty favors, and explain that these petty favors are temporary deceptive measures, so as to awaken the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines and prevent them from drinking poison to quench their thirst and causing future troubles. (13) Expose the ugly faces of the traitors and puppet organizations, announce the past evil deeds of the large and small traitors who misled the country, harmed the people, and acted arbitrarily in their hometowns, as well as the various shameless acts of selling out the motherland and oppressing the people, in order to arouse the hatred of the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines for the traitors. (14) Propagate the facts of victories achieved through military-civilian cooperation in various places (such as the cooperation between the residents of Jiang County and Nanqiao Village in Shanxi and the army, completely annihilating more than 200 enemies), so that the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines deeply understand that military-civilian cooperation is the only key to our victory over the enemy. (15) Widely publicize and explain the general outline of the National Spiritual Mobilization and its implementation methods, the National Civic Code and its oath, convene soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines on a regular basis, hold National Monthly Meetings, take an oath to abide by the National Civic Code, and earnestly implement the National Spiritual Mobilization to establish an indomitable and steadfast national spirit and complete the main conditions for winning the war of resistance. (16) Widely publicize and explain the military-civilian cooperation code formulated by this department, and strive to make the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines abide by it in order to improve our only key to defeating the enemy.</p>
<p>(B) Key Points of Propaganda for Battlefield Troops: (1) Follow the instructions of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek that "The second phase of the War of Resistance is the period when we turn from defense to offense and from defeat to victory," in order to elaborate on the characteristics of the second phase of the strategy, and explain that "The second phase of operations is to complete all the deployments on the strategy of winning the final victory after consuming and exhausting the enemy's forces in the first phase." (Chairman Chiang's words) From then on, turn from defense to offense to achieve "Destroying the enemy's dream of aggression and causing him to fail" (Chairman Chiang's words) and win the final victory. (2) Regular troops stationed behind enemy lines must, when necessary, send out some squads to engage in guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla teams can gather some teams to form regular troops. There is no absolute boundary between the two, so it is necessary to make both understand the necessity of learning from each other's essential functions. (3) The second phase of the War of Resistance has expanded the war zone, and the war front has become longer and more difficult to defend. Transportation is more inconvenient, and the enemy's forces are more insufficient to be distributed, so they will inevitably leave us with many gaps that can be taken advantage of. Therefore, we must strengthen the cooperation and contact of operations in all directions in the operation, and must strive to cultivate the spirit of love and mutual assistance of the troops towards friendly forces to ensure the victory of our operations. (4) The army cannot win victory without the help of the people. The troops staying behind enemy lines, especially the guerrillas, must rely on the people's love, cover, and support. Therefore, the troops in the war zone must have good discipline. "Judging from the experiences in various places in the first phase of the War of Resistance, as long as the government asks the people to do something, as long as there are good methods, the people will be enthusiastic and happy to follow. It can be seen that only the army has let down the people, and no people have let down the army." (Minister's words) Therefore, political workers in the troops behind enemy lines must do everything possible to publicize and infinitely improve the automatic political and military discipline of the troops. "(A) Political Discipline: The troops must "zi" enter and exit to publicize, "chou" clean up, "yin" return borrowed things, "mao" compensate for losses, "chen" be fair in transactions, "yi" speak politely, "wu" strictly abide by all the regulations of the New Life Movement, and "wei" respect good folk customs, so that the people do not hate them, and the troops actively strive to realize the principle of "service is propaganda," earnestly help the people solve difficulties, serve the people, and win the favor of the people. (B) Military Discipline: Must absolutely obey superiors and faithfully execute orders, "cultivate the concept that officers and soldiers value orders more than life," be sincerely united with comrades, manage and love subordinates, be kind and helpful to friendly forces, be hardworking and enduring, and study and research at any time to develop the ability to "fight on their own" once in a difficult environment, and cherish bullets, guns, livestock, utensils, etc. (5) Battlefield troops must be responsible for establishing and consolidating revolutionary political power and organizing revolutionary people. Based on the principle of "propaganda is education," train cadres and strive to make every officer and soldier a propagandist and organizer of the people. Based on their knowledge and abilities, they should propagandize, educate, and organize the people in order to expand the effectiveness of political work and consolidate our political power. (6) Battlefield troops, especially guerrillas, often operate behind the Japanese lines. The Japanese will definitely use all kinds of methods to "sweep" us, and use means of sowing discord, threatening, and enticing to disintegrate us. Therefore, every combatant or other worker must have a strong belief in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance, and must have the determination to sacrifice for the country and the nation in order to consolidate the anti-Japanese base area, develop the guerrillas, and create the power to crush the Japanese. This requires political workers to resolutely and continuously promote and educate them, improve their cultural level, constantly correct their incorrect ideas and views, and constantly enlighten them so that they have a correct understanding. (7) For the scattered soldiers and vagrants who are stranded on the battlefield, and even ruffians and bandits, we must try to take them in and use propaganda and education methods to persuade them, educate them, and put them on the right track so that they are not used by the Japanese. (8) Cooperate with the people to eliminate traitors and enemy spies. Those who can turn over a new leaf and no longer work for the enemy should be allowed to reform themselves and be exempted from punishment in accordance with the government's self-surrender measures for traitors.</p>
<p>(C) Key Points of Propaganda for the People in the War Zone: In addition to the outline of propaganda for the people of the whole country and the above-mentioned common propaganda points, the following matters must be paid attention to in the propaganda for the people in the war zone: (1) First of all, we must at any time publicize the specific facts of the enemy's atrocities, deception, and conspiracies in order to arouse the people's hatred for the enemy. In particular, we must at any time point out "it is best to use our examples of defeating the enemy to prove" the enemy's crisis and weakness, eliminate the people's fear of the enemy, and encourage the people to help destroy the enemy's transportation, hinder the enemy's political, economic, and cultural facilities, and even participate in guerrilla warfare and fight the enemy. We must publicize and educate the people through practical work. (2) We must awaken the people behind enemy lines and raise their vigilance so that they are not deceived and anesthetized by the enemy. (Zi) Do not attend schools and various training classes run by the enemy and traitors, do not read books, newspapers, and magazines published by the enemy and traitors, and all propaganda materials, and mobilize various religious missionaries to lead their followers in the war zone to resist the enemy's and puppets' missionaries and crush the enemy's and traitors' policy of enslaved education. (Chou) Do not believe the enemy's false propaganda. After understanding the enemy's deceptive propaganda, we should tell others so that they will not be fooled again in order to crush the enemy's anesthesia policy. (Yin) Promote the New Life Movement, ban the smoking of drugs "such as morphine and heroin," prostitution, gambling, etc., in order to crush the enemy's poisoning policy. (3) Publicize the people's air defense and cleanup training and preparations. (4) Help the people build the culture of the war zone, that is, help the people in the garrison to restore and establish schools, set up literacy classes, etc., in order to improve the culture of the war zone, eliminate illiteracy, improve the national consciousness of the people, cultivate and promote the spirit of sacrifice, and complete the mission of national spiritual mobilization. (5) Propagate the increase in production in order to improve the people's lives and increase the power of long-term resistance. Political workers should especially mobilize troops to help the people's production labor in their spare time, thoroughly implement the principle of "service is propaganda," and expand the influence of propaganda. (6) In the propaganda for military service, we should pay attention to the environment of the war zone. In areas where it is not easy to implement conscription, we should encourage the people to volunteer and enlist in the army or join the guerrillas to achieve the purpose of military service propaganda. (7) We should cultivate many young and passionate cadres in propaganda and education to supplement and expand our military and political power in the war zone. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>German Head of State Hitler to Deliver a Speech Today; It Is Generally Expected That He Will Show Off His Propaganda Skills and Present Arguments to Refute Roosevelt's Telegram</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Head of State Hitler is scheduled to deliver a speech in the Reichstag at noon tomorrow in response to US President Roosevelt's telegram. All countries around the world are now eagerly awaiting it, and the German people are proud of it. It is generally speculated that when the Head of State speaks, all the arguments that German propaganda is accustomed to using will inevitably be mentioned one by one, such as the usurpation of Germany's old colonies; the fact that the Allied countries have violated the Fourteen Points of the late US President Wilson; Hitler's head has repeatedly proposed to limit armaments, but all the democratic countries have refused; the fact that the democratic countries are colluding with the Bolshevik ideology that destroys everything. In addition, the Head of State may try to explain that Germany has strictly adhered to all the agreements it has signed with other countries, such as the concordat signed between Germany and the Vatican, and the non-aggression pact signed with Poland, which should be used to respond to the outside world's accusations against Germany for violating the Munich Agreement and annexing Czechoslovakia. It is said in political circles that the Head of State may not make any shocking statements, and even the UK's decision to implement conscription will not affect the Head of State's speech. This can be seen in today's afternoon newspapers, which all said that the UK's move is just empty words and wishful thinking. (Havas dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is reported that Hitler once told an official of the National Socialist Party that when he delivers a speech in the Reichstag on Friday, he will reject all calls for peace. It is said that his reason is that it is an unprecedented event in history for the head of one country to ask the ruler of another country to swear to maintain peace for a long time. According to reports, Roosevelt asked Hitler to swear to maintain peace for at least ten years. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) When Hitler replies to his call for peace on Friday, Roosevelt will be sleeping in bed. Roosevelt will leave Washington tonight. He will arrive at his Hyde Park home when Hitler delivers his speech at 6:00 PM. He does not intend to get up early in the morning to listen to the broadcast of Hitler's speech. (Associated Press dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Diplomatic circles here now believe that if Hitler's speech in the Reichstag tomorrow does not close the door to peace, President Roosevelt will make another peace call to Hitler. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin is now hiring many workers to decorate the Grand Theater as the venue for the German Reichstag meeting on the 28th of this month. The large-scale decorations celebrating Hitler's birthday a few days ago will welcome Hitler as he drives from the Head of State's residence to the Grand Theater. However, there will be very few pedestrians along the way. The workers in the factories, the students in the schools, and the employees of the shops will all follow the orders of Propaganda Minister Goebbels and gather beside the wireless electric machine to quietly listen to Hitler's speech. General Goering will announce the opening of the meeting in his capacity as Speaker of the Reichstag, and then Hitler will stand up and speak. It is reported that Hitler is scheduled to speak during the day so that his speech and the official reactions to his speech in the capitals of various countries can be published in the morning world newspapers. A Reuters reporter heard from official circles that Hitler has now drafted his speech, in which he will publish Germany's reply to the UK's implementation of compulsory military service. Today, most of the newspapers here criticized the UK's decision to implement compulsory military service. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>The UK Notifies the Four Powers Separately About the Implementation of Conscription</h3>
<p>(London) Ambassador to Germany Henderson visited German Deputy Foreign Minister Weizsäcker today to inform him that his country fully supports President Roosevelt's call and has decided to implement conscription and promote the new policy with the greatest determination. In addition, the government has not only notified the governments of the United States, France, and Italy separately about the decision to implement conscription, but has also informed the autonomous territories. According to responsible sources, the government has taken all appropriate measures to ensure that "the Military Training Bill can be implemented within two or three days after it is voted on by the parliament. (Havas dispatch on the 26th) After the British cabinet suddenly decided to implement conscription, German political figures were deeply impressed because they did not expect it to be so fast, but they also tried to conceal it, saying that this move was only a "gesture" and did not need to be taken too seriously. The outline of Germany's foreign policy, as well as the content of the speech to be delivered by Hitler on the 28th of this month, will not be changed as a result. The German national character has always been strong and decisive, and will never be shaken by it. In addition, the Hamburg Foreign Review reported that the fact that British Prime Minister Chamberlain has broken the country's traditional spirit shows that the influence exerted on the world by all the omnipotent countries is quite significant. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) British Chargé d'affaires Sir Charles visited Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon to solemnly inform him that his country has decided to implement conscription. Political figures here commented that the UK's move may not be effective. The country's army lacks staff officers and will remain insignificant in the coming years. If a war breaks out at this time, the current balance of power in Europe will not be changed as a result. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Avoids Meeting with the British Ambassador; British Labor Party Members Suspect It Is an Insult</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the government had not instructed Ambassador Henderson to Germany to submit any suggestions or proposals to the German government. We believe that in the current environment, Henderson should remain in his post and inform Germany of the developments in British foreign policy at any time. A member asked if Henderson would meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop before Hitler's speech on Friday. The Prime Minister replied that Henderson had been received by German State Councillor Weizsäcker this morning. Although a meeting with Ribbentrop could not be scheduled at the moment, Henderson would find a way to meet with Ribbentrop at any time in the future. Labor Party member Belenji then spoke, implying rumors that the German Foreign Minister could not meet with Henderson because he did not have time, and asked if this situation was a direct insult to the British ambassador. The Prime Minister replied that there was no need to make such speculation. According to what he had heard, the German Foreign Minister was busy because the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković was visiting Berlin. (Reuters dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Takes His Time; On the Eve of Delivering His Speech, He Watches the Miss America Dance</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler stopped his work on preparing his speech last night and went to the Metro Pole Theater to watch a musical comedy performed by the famous American dancer Miss Verna. According to reports, Miss Verna was summoned to the Prime Minister's private residence for a performance a few weeks ago. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels also invited her to perform when he entertained guests. It was decided that when Hitler went to the theater to visit, he only had a small number of guards to protect him, and the theater authorities were not notified in advance. (Associated Press dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>The British Government's Military Training Bill Is Submitted to the House of Commons for Discussion; The Prime Minister Strongly Argues That the Times Are Critical and Urges Speedy Passage</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain introduced a motion to welcome compulsory military service in the House of Commons today, and mentioned consulting with other parties, stating that the government did not want to keep them in the dark. He continued that the government was doing this under pressure and did not have time to consult in detail. If this resolution is delayed until next week, it will be considered to be related to Hitler's speech tomorrow. The Prime Minister replied to a question from opposition leader Attlee, saying that he believed that this matter was of utmost importance to the country, so the House of Commons should vote tonight. The House of Commons could hold a debate on the second reading of the bill next week. The full text of the bill will be published early next week. The Prime Minister and the Destructive Argument section cited his previous remarks on the issue of conscription and said, "The situation in two of these things is very different from today. Neither of them had the war looming large, and at that time, no one had in mind a problem that seemed to be leading to war. Today, we no longer believe that the needs of the country can be met by the voluntary system. If we do not assess the situation and change our previous views, then there is nothing more likely to lead the country to disaster than this. To say that we cannot change our previous views is tantamount to saying that we cannot take a plan to protect the country unless we hold a general election. Now the situation is very urgent, so the government has no other way but to implement compulsory military service." (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Explains Key Points of Two Bills: Government Given Full Authority for Three Years</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that, while we have made great efforts in military preparations, nothing makes the world feel that our country has the determination to resist aggression more than our acceptance of the principle of compulsory military service.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced the government's new conscription plan, stating that the government will propose two bills. One is to allow various military service departments to call up any level or type of reserve and auxiliary forces. The main points of the other bill are: (1) the power to call up all men between the ages of twenty and twenty-one for military training; (2) this training will only be given in Great Britain, but in the event of war, the responsibility of serving overseas will be uniformly applied; (3) the men called up will first receive six months of military training, after which they will be discharged, but if they are willing, they may join the National Defense Volunteer Force for three and a half years, during which time they may be called up to perform the normal duties of a volunteer soldier, or be called up and transferred to the special reserve of the regular army; (4) provisions will be made to allow individuals to state valid reasons for being called up for training a few days earlier or later, depending on the circumstances of the country at the time; (5) provisions will be made so that conscientious objectors may be exempted from military service by the conscription tribunal, provided that they undertake work of significant benefit to the country in lieu of military service.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister explained to the House of Commons the government's reasons for implementing conscription, saying that this system is already widely implemented in Europe. The voluntary system has a clear weakness, namely that people are busy seeking pleasure or profit while their neighbors are focusing on training for war. In times of war, military service will immediately become compulsory, which is already understood and accepted by the general public. The Prime Minister continued, saying that until now, he did not believe it was necessary to implement such a plan in peacetime. He reiterated the promise he made to Lord Baldwin (former Prime Minister), that he would never propose compulsory military service in peacetime during the life of this Parliament. We are not currently facing war, but the belief in maintaining peace has been destroyed as countries exhaust all their resources for war preparations. Everyone knows that if war comes, our entry into the war will be a matter of hours, not weeks. No one dares to say that today is still peacetime and can properly use this term to describe it. According to the bill, in times of unrest, it is necessary to call up certain volunteer forces and regular army personnel to strengthen our national air defense system. This extreme period may last a long time. This will cause those called up in the volunteer army to make a greater and longer sacrifice than they expected when they volunteered. The government has decided that it is currently necessary to implement compulsory military training to cope with the new special situation. When I say "currently," I want to clearly state that the government's proposal will be included in the second bill, named the Military Training Bill, and will be temporary in nature.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued that the powers granted to the government by the two bills will be for a period of three years, which can be terminated by the cabinet if the situation changes. However, at the end of the three-year period, it can also be extended for one year, provided that a definite resolution is passed by both houses. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Labor Groups Joint Meeting Passes Labor Party Amendment</h3>
<p>Expresses Regret Over Government Actions - Executive Committee of the Trades Union Congress, Executive Committee of the National Labor Party, and Executive Committee of the Parliamentary Labor Party held a joint meeting today and unanimously passed the amendment proposed by the Labor Party in the House of Commons, expressing regret over the government's abandonment of the principle of voluntary conscription, and stating that compulsory conscription is ill-considered. The National Labor Council will meet on May 1 to consider its position based on the situation of today's debate in the House of Commons. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<h3>London Air Defense Forces Ordered to Emergency Readiness to Cope with Crisis Within 24 Hours</h3>
<p>(London) Today, British Prime Minister Chamberlain strongly urged Parliament to quickly pass the conscription bill because "no one can claim this is a time of peace." The bill will allow Britain to conscript 300,000 young men into the army each year. Chamberlain hopes to pass the bill in the House of Commons before nightfall. This move comes on the eve of Hitler's speech and is a warning to Hitler, indicating that Britain is prepared to join the war if necessary. The British government has issued an emergency order to prevent unexpected events, instructing all national anti-aircraft gun teams to prepare for a crisis within 24 hours. The British military spent all night last night preparing to replenish the strength of the national air defense gun teams, which will first include the 20-year-old conscripts. Chamberlain announced that Britain had to call up national defense guard members and non-regular air force personnel to reinforce the national air defense gun teams. This precautionary measure was taken afterward, similar to the measures taken during the crisis last September. Yesterday, hundreds of people gathered at conscription offices in London, preparing to enlist. The conscription of 20-year-olds ended at midnight. At 3 a.m., doctors were specially called to examine the physical condition of those enlisting. The auxiliary forces of the air force, including lookouts, defense balloons, searchlights, and anti-aircraft gun teams, were ordered to guard key locations in London and along the coast to watch for enemy aircraft. There are a total of 14,000 lookouts nationwide. The auxiliary air force currently has twenty flying squadrons, mostly fighter squadrons. There are ten defense balloon teams near London. The government's move is intended to make the public believe in the necessity of conscription. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<h3>Canada to Train Air Force Personnel for Britain - Agreement Reached</h3>
<p>Ottawa - Canadian Defense Minister Mackenzie stated in the House of Commons today that the British and Canadian governments have now concluded a three-year plan to train air force pilots in Canada. Britain will send 50 students and pilots to Canada each year. (Reuter, 26th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Mussolini has summoned cabinet members to meet on Saturday morning. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>Romania Will Not Fall into Germany's Embrace - Close Relations Between Britain and Romania - Gafencu Arrives in France for Talks</h3>
<p>(London) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, after completing his visit to London, issued a communique stating that the talks were extremely frank and sincere, and focused on the general common outlook on current issues between the two governments. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed political sources here recently declared that after the Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's talks with the British authorities in recent days, relations between Britain and Romania have become closer, and the possibility of Romania falling into Germany's embrace has completely disappeared. Economically, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, is currently in the Romanian capital negotiating an agreement with the Romanian authorities. Once the agreement is reached, Romania will be economically and financially free from the control of Germany and Italy. Politically, the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Poland has had a significant impact on the talks between the British and Romanian authorities. It is reported that the Soviet government no longer insists on revising the current guarantee treaties of the Baltic countries to explicitly target Germany. At the same time, the British government will also instruct its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, to urge the Soviet Union to provide a guarantee that if any neighboring countries are invaded and seek assistance from the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will provide assistance to the extent specified by the invaded country. In addition, the issue of cooperation between Romania and Turkey is also one of the goals of the talks between the British and Romanian authorities. Regarding this, it is expected that significant progress will be made after Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin's visit to the Turkish capital. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here from London at 11 p.m. tonight. Foreign Minister Bonnet, the Romanian Ambassador Tataresco, and many dignitaries welcomed him at the station. Foreign Minister Gafencu is scheduled to return home with Premier Daladier via Rome and the Yugoslav capital on the 29th of this month. According to responsible sources here, Foreign Minister Gafencu will inform the French authorities of the talks he had with the authorities of Poland, Germany, Belgium, and Britain during his visits, and will conduct talks with them on various issues related to France and Romania, as well as the general international situation. To this day, the harmony of Franco-Romanian relations is unprecedented, and both sides can frankly exchange views. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>British Implementation of Compulsory Military Service - French Diplomatic Victory - French and American Public Opinion Express Satisfaction</h3>
<p>(Paris) French political circles today expressed congratulations on Britain's determination to implement conscription, and recognized this as a diplomatic victory for French Prime Minister Daladier. The entire French nation today was deeply pleased that Britain's announcement gave Hitler a real message. According to military experts here, if the British conscription system is completed, the military strength of Britain and France will be around 10,000,000. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the British cabinet decided to implement conscription, French officials expressed great satisfaction, saying that this was an unprecedented initiative in British history. In recent years, countries in Europe whose sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity have been threatened have been automatically guaranteed by Britain. This decision to implement conscription shows Britain's determination to fulfill its commitments. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) "Le Débat" titled "A Very Significant Event," which is a typical attitude of the French nation towards British Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement of conscription. "Le Temps" stated that today's decision and yesterday's budget speech mean that Britain is placing the full weight of its moral and material strength in the balance to face the situation and faithfully fulfill its national and international responsibilities. Germany would make a big mistake if it considered British conscription a provocation, as Germany has destroyed the spirit and letter of the treaties and resumed national military power. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After Britain decided to implement conscription, people from all walks of life in the United States expressed satisfaction, saying that if the Axis powers attempt to change the European status quo by force in the future, Britain has decided to resist by all means. This is evidenced by the country's implementation of conscription. This move is also a sign that Britain has effectively abandoned the "Munich policy." The security guarantees recently provided by Britain and France to the small countries of Europe will also be more trusted by these small countries. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) There is no criticism here of Britain's implementation of conscription. Most people will wait to see how the British constituencies and dominions react before commenting. It is generally believed that Chamberlain's justification for implementing conscription in what is not "peacetime" will undoubtedly be seen as contrary to his efforts to ensure equal sacrifices from all classes. Recently, American newspapers have strongly criticized Britain for making improper profits through military buildup and air defense work. The US Congress is now using various plans to prevent "profiting from war" and advocates conscripting funds and manpower during wartime. The general public believes that the British will demand the implementation of plans similar to those in the United States in order to achieve equality. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Mock Britain - Talking on Paper</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The British government's decision to implement conscription has been commented on by various newspapers here, with varying opinions. Some ridicule the move, saying that it is temporary in nature and its effectiveness remains to be seen. Others see it as part of Britain's encirclement policy and therefore feel uneasy. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung stated, "The British conscription system is only of interest to military experts and is not worth discussing in depth. But it has its own political significance, which Prime Minister Chamberlain has explained frankly. In other words, Britain's implementation of conscription is a diplomatic tool, intended to force small countries to join the encirclement policy, and that is all." The Lokalanzeiger stated, "Britain's move is a political action, intended to incite small countries to join the encirclement policy. The international situation is precarious, and people are afraid of war. British agitators cannot shirk their responsibility." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Last night, Berlin newspapers carried lengthy reports and comments on Britain's implementation of compulsory military service, stating that Britain's motive for taking this step was twofold: first, to put pressure on Berlin on the eve of Chancellor Hitler's speech to the Reichstag, and second, to give the small countries of Europe an impression to strengthen their trust in Britain. The "Berliner Nachtausgabe" said, "The various diplomatic and military measures recently taken by the 'encirclement countries' have not made a deep impression on Germany. Germany will continue to pursue its established policy of 'seeking indispensable living space for Germany,' regardless of the strategy of the countries opposed to the Axis." (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<h3>Deep Impression in Rome</h3>
<p>(Rome) Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration on conscription has had a significant psychological impact on Italian political figures, who see it as an "internal revolution" in British politics. The British Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Noel Charles, visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano this morning to inform him of Britain's decision. Because Britain gave advance notice of this decision to Berlin and Rome, everyone feels greatly satisfied. Military figures believe that this conscription plan is a major increase in the strength of the Anglo-French bloc. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The official Italian impression of Britain's implementation of compulsory conscription is very deep. According to Italian officials last night, this move by Britain is in preparation for taking a firm stand and making no further concessions to the totalitarian states. At the same time, the evening newspapers here stated that Britain's decision to adopt conscription legislation may be the result of French pressure. The wording of the newspapers attempts to give the general impression that the government's move has not received the support of the people. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Eastern Newspaper Comments</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The British government's decision to implement compulsory military service has attracted widespread attention here. The Japan Broadcaster stated that Britain's determination to cope with the current crisis in Europe is being expressed daily. The most surprising thing is the introduction of the Compulsory Military Service Bill in Parliament, as a warning to Hitler before his speech on April 28 that any further harm to European peace will be met with determined resistance. The Asahi Shimbun stated that this decision by Britain will cause a major reaction in Europe. However, it is doubtful how effective hundreds of thousands of troops can be after only a few months of training. Britain made this move at the request of France, and France will definitely gain some comfort from it. However, Britain's decision comes before Hitler's speech, and the situation may become more serious as a result. The Hochi Shimbun stated that this decision by Britain will not ease the European situation, but will only make it more serious. This is an indication of an offensive against Germany and Italy, which will stimulate the Axis powers. Britain obviously wants to ease Hitler's speech on April 28, but it is feared that it will backfire, and the rift between the Axis powers and the democracies will deepen from now on. Britain is encircling Germany and now implementing compulsory military service, and cannot be regarded as a peace-loving country. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Germany, even if it loves peace, cannot negotiate peace with Britain unless Britain abandons its intimidating behavior, because Britain is now intimidating Germany with compulsory military service and encirclement policies. If Britain does not abandon its hostility towards Germany and show its sincerity in seeking peace, the European crisis cannot be eliminated. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japan Has No Spare Capacity to Help the Axis Powers in War - The Entire Nation Opposes Military Alliance with Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>(London) The Times' Tokyo correspondent stated that no matter what Hitler says in his speech on the 28th, he cannot claim that Japan will fight for the Axis powers in the Pacific. The entire Japanese nation, except for the military, opposes a military alliance with Germany and Italy. The majority of cabinet members also hold this view. The fact that a bill not allowing the strengthening of Axis relations was formally introduced in the Diet shows this. The proponents of an alliance with Germany and Italy are mainly the army, and the attitude of the Japanese army is influenced by the troops in China. This faction believes that all the difficulties encountered in the war against China are due to British aid to China. As for the navy, it is difficult to support a policy that would cause the navies of various countries to join the Soviet Union in confronting Japan. (27th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to reports from the scene, a tragic explosion occurred at the Yubari coal mine in southwestern Takizawa Prefecture, Hokkaido. As a result, 1,200 miners were buried underground. Although rescue efforts began after the accident, only 160 workers have been rescued so far. The fate of the other 1,040 is unknown. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Press Delegation Arrives in Yokohama Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A 13-member German press delegation, led by Forster, Chairman of the German-Japanese Society in Berlin, arrived in Yokohama at 5 p.m. today after traveling by ship from Genoa on March 29. They will stay in Tokyo for a week and plan to study Japan's activities in the political, economic, industrial, and cultural fields. Japan has prepared a welcoming program, and Foreign Minister Arita will hold a reception, while the Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will host a banquet. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<h3>British Empire Implements Conscription - Ireland and Canada Express Support</h3>
<p>(London) According to London political figures, the Irish Free State will not oppose Britain's announcement yesterday of the implementation of compulsory military service, and there will be no difficulties in conscripting and training Irish people residing in England. It is said that this "friendly attitude" of the South Irish government would have been impossible a year ago. It is estimated that from 1932 to 1938, the total number of people who moved to England from South Ireland was more than 220,000, of which 90 percent were between the ages of 19 and 45. (Haitong, 27th)</p>
<p>Ottawa - The decision by Britain to implement conscription has been well-received by political figures here, but there is no consensus on whether the Canadian Federation should establish the same principle, and the debate is quite heated. Those who usually tend to cooperate with Britain have expressed support, while people in the western provinces, such as Quebec, have mostly expressed opposition. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>British War Office Explains the "Home Defense" Bill</h3>
<p>(London) The War Office recently issued a communiqué explaining the "Home Defense" Bill, stating that there are currently two things regarding the Ministry's defense that are well-known to the public: (1) if this defense needs to be undertaken by the regular army or the reserves, the more active responsibilities that these troops must assume at the beginning of any incident will be hindered; (2) these troops must quickly go to the scene at the beginning of any incident. In view of this, the government has decided to form the Home Defense, making it part of the reserve force, dedicated to the Ministry's defense. The uniforms, weapons, and equipment needed by the soldiers of this Home Defense will be supplied by the War Office. Each soldier will receive military training for a certain period, and their pay and allowances will be the same as those of reserve soldiers. All retired officers and soldiers who are too old to re-enter the regular army and air defense forces can find an opportunity to serve the country here. The British Veterans Association has officially expressed its support for this matter. (Havas, 27th)</p>

<h3>Chao-Shan Emergency Evacuation of Population</h3>
<h3>Completed Within Three Days Starting on the 19th</h3>
<h3>Military and Police Deployed Along the Coast to Prepare for the Enemy</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Chao-Shan authorities convened a meeting of representatives from various sectors on the 19th and set a three-day deadline for the emergency evacuation of the population. When this news spread, various businesses telegraphed Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other ports to stop distributing goods. Some medicinal herb shops, seeing the shortage of seasoned medicines in Chaozhou and Meizhou and fearing that Chao-Shan would be blockaded by Japanese warships, making it impossible to treat patients in the interior, specially sent partners to Hong Kong to search for medicines produced in Yunnan, regardless of the price, to snap them up and store them in the interior.</p>
<p>The Chao-Shan Railway Company opened up trains all night starting on the evening of the 19th to transport the population. The Garrison Headquarters also earnestly implemented the evacuation measures. The populations of Chao'an, Chenghai, and Raoping counties gradually moved upstream to Meizhou starting on the 10th. The boats and vehicles that had been requisitioned for military use were released as much as possible to provide transportation. The provincial government has telegraphed Zhou Jingzhen, the administrative commissioner of the Sixth District, instructing him to notify the counties of Meizhou that when the evacuated people arrive, each village should set up inquiry stations to provide tea and water or temporary overnight accommodation, and strictly prohibit raising house rents and prices. Any officials who dare to take the opportunity to exploit and profit will be charged with profiteering from national crisis and executed without mercy. Starting on the evening of the 19th, the population began to move upstream. The military and police jointly launched a major curfew in the coastal suburbs. Only able-bodied men who were not allowed to evacuate were left in the coastal villages. Large inland armies (including artillery) appeared along the coast starting on the 20th, practicing shooting and guarding the newly completed fortifications day and night, assisting in maintaining local order. This evacuation of the population is a necessary strategic action to strike at the enemy. Chao'an, Shantou, Chenghai, and Raoping counties and cities are executing it simultaneously. At least one million people will be evacuated.</p>
<p>Shantou City's emergency evacuation of the population must be completed within three days. The evacuation measures are as follows: (A) Population Migration: (1) All elderly, weak, women, and children over 60 years old and under 15 years old, and unemployed vagrants in the city must be evacuated within three days, by the 23rd. (2) The police bureau will immediately send police to persuade households door-to-door. The town and Baojia chiefs will earnestly assist in persuading evacuation. (3) Those who cannot evacuate due to economic hardship or other reasons will be investigated and coordinated by the police bureau. (4) Impoverished children will be investigated by the police bureau and reported to the Guangdong Children's Welfare Association by the garrison headquarters, who will send personnel to Shantou to take them in, bring them to the orphanage, and raise them. (5) All levels of schools must move to the interior within three days. The city government will set detailed measures separately. Evacuated students are requested to be allowed by the city government to be admitted to various primary and secondary schools in the interior to join classes. (6) Children who fail to evacuate after the deadline will be forcibly taken in by personnel sent by the garrison headquarters. After the evacuation, residents remaining in the city should prepare to form teams to assist the military and police in combat and be determined to fight the enemy to the death, and must not move freely. (B) Material Migration: (1) All large and small shops, market goods, funds, and large and small factories must be moved to the interior within three days. Those that cannot be moved (electricity, tap water) may be requested to be moved and kept by the government and be subject to government control. (2) The principle of factories and market goods is to move to the interior and must not be moved abroad or to occupied areas. (3) Factories and materials that cannot be dismantled or are unwilling to move will be the responsibility of the chamber of commerce to convene representatives of various guilds to discuss the results, list them, and report them to the garrison headquarters, which will telegraphed the China Industrial Cooperative Society to send engineers to Shantou to dismantle, move, and manage them. (4) The 100,000 bags of rice currently stored in the city will be telegraphed by the garrison headquarters to the counties of Meipu to quickly come to Shantou to purchase as much as possible, and instruct rice merchants to leave 2 million catties within three days for the city to use for one month in response to the war. The rest will be transported to the interior. Rice merchants must continue to procure rice and transport it to the interior within one week after import. (5) All banks should disperse to borrow money according to previous plans. (6) During the evacuation period, the customs and tax bureaus and various relevant agencies should handle all material and mechanical certification procedures for merchants moving day and night. (7) If various guilds need to convene meetings on material evacuation, they should speed up the meeting results and not delay the time. The above are resolutions that the authorities forcibly implemented. In recent days, the highways have been destroyed for the second time. The Chao'an, Jieyang, and Fengshun avenues will definitely be bombed by the end of this month and will no longer be open to traffic.</p>
<h3>Tragic Situation of Japanese Aircraft Bombing Hengyang</h3>
<h3>Most of the Urban Area Was Burned Down</h3>
<h3>Even the Wounded Soldiers' Hospital Was Damaged by Bombing</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that Mrs. Kilpatrick of Shanghai recently received a letter from her husband, Pastor Kilpatrick, from Hengyang, Hunan. The letter stated that on April 6, Hengyang was attacked from the air. Around 10:00 AM, the first air raid siren sounded. The Chinese people rushed into the church buildings and took refuge in the air raid shelters that had been dug shortly after the military uprising. They did not appear to be particularly alarmed. After circling in the sky over the city for a few minutes, a team disappeared quietly. After this siren, at 11:00, a Japanese plane flew in from the east and reconnoitered the city, but also did not drop a bomb and left. But soon, the buzzing sound of planes was heard, and 18 bombers were seen flying towards the city. The people in the houses of the city had not yet had time to return to the air raid shelters when the sound of bombs exploding was heard. Japanese planes dropped bombs in this undefended city, and the hissing sound of the bombs falling could be heard. Many bombs fell nearby, causing a terrible shock. After each plane dropped all of its bombs, it circled the burning city once and left. Kilpatrick knew that some bombs must have hit nearby. As soon as the sound of the planes gradually faded, he immediately left the air raid shelter. At the door, he met two Chinese women covered in dust and almost unrecognizable. They told him that a house where several people were taking refuge had been hit twice. Kilpatrick and two other foreigners rushed to the site and saw that although the walls had not collapsed, the roof was completely destroyed, and they faintly heard shouts coming from inside the house. At first, they did not know where the shouts were coming from, but then they saw a hand waving from the rubble, and they realized that it was leading to the cellar, where several people were taking refuge. The rescuers removed the rubble and rescued one Chinese person who was crushed inside. Fortunately, he was not seriously injured. Another Chinese person had his right arm and left leg struck by falling timber and was carried to the hospital after being rescued. He died the next day. At that time, fires broke out in the city, and thick smoke filled the air. The missionaries expected that most of Hengyang would be in the fire. Further investigation revealed that most of the commercial buildings along the telegraph station and post office, as well as a Chinese hospital with wounded soldiers, were all destroyed. The hospital had a Red Cross flag clearly marked. Few of the people in the hospital escaped, and the rest were buried in the fire. The 15-minute air raid turned a prosperous city into a huge pile of rubble.</p>
<h3>The Silkworm Cocoons of Jiangnan Were All Seized</h3>
<h3>Controlled by the "Central China Company"</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Now is the height of the spring silkworm season. The villagers in the counties of Wuxi and Chengxiang have always regarded sericulture as a major sideline industry in rural areas. Driven by profit, many people raise silkworms. However, it is all controlled by the Japanese "Central China Company." It is estimated that more than 200,000 freshly hatched silkworms have been distributed. The silkworms have now reached the first sleep stage. The "Central China Company" is actively preparing for the cocoon harvest. Based on current weather forecasts, a bumper cocoon harvest is expected. There are more than 100 cocoon shops in the counties of Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiangyin, Danyang, Jintan, Dantu, Jurong, and Yixing that have signed contracts, all of which are controlled by the "Central China Company" in Wuxi for cocoon collection. Wuxian, Changshu, Wujiang, and other counties are managed by the "Central China Company" in Suzhou. The silkworm cocoons of Jiangnan were all seized, which is very distressing.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Gaoyou Recovers Hehuatang</h3>
<h3>Chinese Army in Yiling Attacks Fairy Temple</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The military strength, heavy artillery, and other military equipment of the Japanese army entrenched in the Huai River area are now being moved to Xuzhou, and the fortifications they have built are being automatically destroyed. Their intentions are unclear, and it seems that they intend to abandon them.</p>
<p>The Wang Brigade of the Chinese Army in Gaoyou has recovered Hehuatang. On the morning of the 18th, a battalion of the Chinese Army in Yiling was ordered to lead a team to attack the Japanese army in Fairy Temple. They engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army for several hours in the areas of Doutian Temple, Jiangjia Bridge, and Wenchang Palace in the southeast of the town. The Japanese army was accustomed to shooting with machine guns and firing artillery to show their power, consuming a lot of ammunition. The Chinese army, believing that the task of consuming the Japanese strength had been achieved, safely returned to their defenses. The Japanese army has recently completed the construction of the highway from Zhaoguan Dam to the front of Shaobo to facilitate the reinforcement and delivery of grain when the Chinese army launches a general counterattack. However, the Chinese army has been launching fierce attacks and bravely advancing day and night, and has also launched surprise attacks from hidden locations on the flanks, and has destroyed part of the newly built highway. The Japanese army feared that their retreat would be cut off, so they urgently retreated to the strongholds south of Zhaoguan Dam to defend. The two sides are currently in a stalemate.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Yeshe and Songyin</h3>
<h3>Two Traitors Beheaded</h3>
<p>Jinshan Correspondence: After the Chinese army's Yuan Yingjie unit reorganized the guerrillas in the Tianma Mountain area and received a large number of new weapons, they were led by Cai Xiren, the administrative commissioner of the Fourth District of Jiangsu Province, to launch a large-scale encirclement of the Japanese army in the Yeshe, Songyin, Ganxiang, and Zhangze areas. Yuan Yingjie led a death squad of 100 men to directly attack the rear of the Japanese army. Fierce fighting took place along the entire line for three days and nights. Many were captured. In all areas of Jinshan Tong, Luxiang Zhongdai, and Xincang, the Japanese army forced the chairman of the Zhongdai Maintenance Association, Mr. Yu, and Gu, a fake staff member of the Jinshan pseudo-county government, to force the people to rush to build highways day and night. However, after the highways were built, they were destroyed by the Chinese army's plainclothes teams. Yu and Gu were also captured by the Chinese army and beheaded. Recently, there has been fierce fighting in Qiaoxingta, Qianjiawei, and Hougang. More than 1,000 regular troops have also been opened to Luxiang.</p>

<p>The matters carried out in social education before and after the war are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Promoting Mass Education: (A) "Promoting the Literacy Movement": Suzhou, Zhejiang, and the Beijing area have achieved better results. (B) "Promoting Public Schools": Since 1936, each county and city must increase the number of public schools by 20 to 40 each year. Each school enrolls two terms per year, with two classes per term and 50 students per class. On average, each county can train 6,000 out-of-school people, calculated by 30 schools. The whole country can train 12 million people with 2,000 cities and counties. If it increases year by year, it is expected to complete the initial popularization work in six years. As a result of the implementation in 1936, 12 million illiterate people have been eliminated. (C) "Promoting Phonetic Symbols": Since July 1936, all new textbooks and books compiled for primary schools and public schools must be printed with attention to Chinese characters, otherwise they will not be approved.

The teaching period was shortened to two months, and it was limited to one year of popularization. Unfortunately, it was not fully successful due to the impact of the war. Subsequently, the education halls of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Gansu were ordered to conduct preliminary studies in Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, Lanzhou, and their important counties and cities. It is expected that after one year, all illiterate people in the important cities and counties in the rear can be eliminated.</p>

<h3>Sports News from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Sent by Nan Yan from Hong Kong</p>
<p>(1) When Zhang Rongcai first came to Hong Kong, he was very lucky. Later, he followed the South China Athletic Association to Saigon for a trip, and he became very popular. South China's strategist Mo Qing even said: "Zhang is better than Bao Jiaping and Tan Junqian." However, Zhang Rongcai is indeed a hard worker. He has shown some skills in low-level balls, and he does have his strengths. Perhaps because he was too excited, or because he was too tired from playing too many games, he performed disappointingly for a long period after returning to Hong Kong. Fortunately, this was a feverish illness, and he is slowly recovering to his normal state now.</p>
<p>(2) Luo Douwen has recently suffered a "fall" in the South China Athletic Association. When fighting Xinghua, he once used Yang Shuiyi, who used to kick the stone wing. This is a matter of losing face, and of course there are some tricks in it. However, in fact, Yang Shuiyi is not better than Luo Douwen, and this cannot be hidden from the Hong Kong fans. However, I must also say that Luo Douwen also has some faults. It is true that he is afraid to work hard. He is always shrinking back, as if he advocates doing less is better than doing more. When grabbing the ball, he lacks a bit of energy, which makes people feel uncomfortable. In short, the biggest problem is that he drags his feet when dribbling, and he lacks some of the strength that a man should have when attacking.</p>
<p>For a while, even people who watched it were anxious for him, and they advised his beloved wife to return to Shanghai earlier, so as not to create obstacles to training. However, his "wife" did not agree, and the diplomacy was not settled, so it was over. Later, his "wife" felt that some situations were not optimistic, so she had to endure the pain of separation. Now, of course, it depends on how the "husband" is doing.</p>
<p>(3) South China made a lot of money on their trip to Annam. The Eastern Athletic Association saw that the situation was still good, measured their strength, and thought that their reputation was also good, so they pulled together a few people and decided to take a trip as well. Chen Fuyu seems to be doing very well, serving as the leader, and Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiuting are playing key roles. As of now, they have played a total of four games, resulting in three wins and one draw, which is enough face. However, there is an extra Zhang Jinhai in Chen Rongli. According to the itinerary, it will take Zhang Jinhai almost mid-April to get from Chongqing to Haiphong at the earliest, and there is obviously something mysterious about this. Zhang Rongcai said: This is not the real Zhang Jinhai, but a Mr. Jin who was invited from St. Joseph's in Hong Kong. Fortunately, the Annamese don't recognize him, so let him do whatever he wants.</p>
<p>Zhong Yongsen has also gone, and the Eastern Athletic Association is happy to be a "foreigner" in the market. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Customs Statistics Show - Western Countries' Trade with China Plummets - Japan's Exports to China Increase Fourfold - German and Italian Commerce Suffers Similarly</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the latest customs statistics reveal that the trade of Western countries with China has suddenly fallen to a level unprecedented in modern commercial history, while Japan has received a rich reward after blocking the gates in the occupied areas. Although the Japanese government firmly denies that the trade restriction regulations implemented in the occupied areas are intended to discriminate against foreign merchants, the customs statistics for the first three months of this year show that the goods imported into China by major countries have fallen even more than the figures for the same period last year, which were affected by the war, while Japan's exports to China have increased more than fourfold. Japan's colonies' exports to China have also reached this proportion. Japan's exports to China, which openly boycotted its goods, were 16,931,000 yuan in the first three months of last year, and 71,388,000 yuan in the same period this year. In contrast, the United Kingdom's exports to China have fallen sharply.</p>
<p>The figures for January to March last year were 22,251,000 yuan, which fell to 15,549,000 yuan in the same period this year. Only the increase in trade between China and the British Commonwealth and colonies restored the advantage of British trade in China. From January to March last year, Australia, British East and West Africa, India, Siam, Canada, Ceylon, Egypt, Hong Kong, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom's exports to China totaled 34,122,000 yuan, and in the same period this year, they were 52,462,000 yuan. The two other "axis" countries, Germany and Italy, were most severely affected by the Japanese restrictions. This is quite noteworthy. In the first three months of last year, Germany's exports to China were worth 45,184,000 yuan, while in the same period this year, they were only 18,323,000 yuan. Italy suffered even more, falling from 13,684,000 yuan in the first three months of last year to 1,847,000 yuan in the same period this year. The most prominent feature in the statistics is the sharp increase in China's exports. In the first three months of this year, the total was 194,583,000 yuan, an increase of 60,125,000 yuan over the same period last year. As a result of this sharp increase, the import surplus has been reduced from 95,812,000 yuan in the first three months of last year to 79,856,000 yuan in the same period this year.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Japanese Man, Inoue, Commits Seppuku at the Public Works Department - But Does Not Achieve His Goal and His Injury Improves - No Explanation for the "Glorious Sacrifice"</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, Inoue, an unemployed Japanese man, 35 years old, entered the Public Works Department building at 11:50 AM yesterday (the 26th), wandered in the corridor for several minutes, did not attempt to meet with anyone, and then at the escalator entrance of the Finance Department on the second floor, pulled out a seppuku dagger, intending to cut open his stomach. Although he bled a lot, he was not seriously injured. He was rushed to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road by a fire brigade ambulance. Last night, it was heard that his injury had improved greatly and he is expected to recover soon. According to what the police detectives of the Police Department were able to confirm before the Japanese authorities handled the case, Inoue came to Shanghai from Japan ten days ago and lived at No. 441 Peng Road. It was heard that he came to Shanghai to seek work, but every application was unsuccessful. This time, he attempted seppuku, and he did not mention the reason, but many believe that he was forced to do so by economic difficulties. Yesterday, it was claimed that this case was not ordinary, because seppuku is considered in Japan to be a glorious way to eliminate crimes, or a martyrdom of a sacrificed person. However, in Inoue's case, he did not leave a letter, nor did he utter words of motivation. According to Japanese sources last night, Inoue came to Shanghai intending to be a bodyguard for a Chinese puppet. His attempt to end his life was a protest against the Public Works Department's "disloyalty" in handling anti-Japanese activities and the Japanese authorities' "indifferent" attitude toward the Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>After the Shanghai-Ningbo Line Was Closed - Ningbo Suffered Repeated Air Raids - Attempt to Bomb the Old Taiping Steamer Failed - Local Area Was Peaceful, Prices Increased Slightly - No Trace of Japanese Warships on the Zhenhai Waters</h3>
<p>The Enderby steamer of the Italian company Zhongyi Steamship Company in this city was approved by the Zhejiang Provincial Authorities to transport American wheat from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 19th. It could have returned to Shanghai immediately, but due to the requests of various parties to transport local products to Shanghai, the Ningbo Garrison Command sent a telegram to the Tenth Army for instructions, and it was approved to transport five kinds of goods, including wine, tin foil, cotton, cotton yarn, and egg products, for export, but passengers were absolutely not allowed. After receiving the order, the ship left Ningbo at 4:00 PM the other day and arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday. It is also learned that the Ningbo Taifeng Factory is now continuing to request the authorities to allow the Enderby steamer to transport wheat to Ningbo a second time, but it has not yet been approved.</p>
<p>No Japanese Warships Outside Zhenhai Estuary. According to Chinese employees of the Enderby steamer, the ship was inspected by Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Estuary on the morning of the 20th while sailing to Ningbo. In addition to asking about nationality and conducting inspections, they also inquired to the Italian shipowner about the preparations of the Chinese army in the territorial waters. The Italian shipowner often replied that it was a military matter and outsiders could not know. The Japanese army had no choice but to let the ship enter the port. It is also learned that a Japanese warship No. 5 sailed into the sea area of Tingshui Gate in Zhenhai on the 21st, and did not stop, but sailed into the Houtou Ferry in Fenghua Port, searching passing civilian ships. The ship did not withdraw from Houtou Ferry until about 11:00 AM, and suddenly fired three cannons at the coast between Hengshanbu and Houtou Ferry. Since then, until the Enderby left Ningbo, there was no news of Japanese warships harassing the area, so the local situation was extremely peaceful. When the ship sailed out of Zhenhai Estuary the other day afternoon, no trace of Japanese warships was found, so the local area was peaceful.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Repeatedly Flew to Ningbo for Air Raids</p>
<p>It was also reported that Ningbo suddenly discovered three Japanese planes invading the city's airspace at about 10:00 AM on the 25th. The air defense force immediately issued an air raid alarm. After circling several times, the Japanese planes flew to the airspace above the Jiangbei shore and bombed the old Taiping steamer (the ship was reserved to be sunk to blockade Zhenhai Estuary) moored at the China Merchants Bureau dock, dropping a total of five or six bombs. However, most of the bombs fell into the river and did not hit the target. Only one bomb fell on the riverside, and the dock was slightly damaged. There were no deaths or injuries. Also, at 4:00 PM yesterday, the shipping industry in this city received a telegram that Ningbo had another air raid alarm yesterday. The first time was at 8:20 AM and was lifted at 9:40 AM. The second time was at 10:00 AM and was lifted at 11:25 AM. Whether or not bombs were dropped was not mentioned.</p>
<p>Prices Rise During the Suspension of Navigation</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Ningbo line was closed, the prices of various commodities in Ningbo have risen due to the disruption of supplies. The average price of silk fabrics and general merchandise has increased by about 25% to 30%. The average price of tea, snacks, and flour has also increased by 20% to 30%. As for rice, due to insufficient reserves, the highest price was 15.6 yuan per dan, and the lowest price was 14 yuan. In order to regulate food supply, the authorities are actively purchasing from Jiangxi Province to clear the source, and 80,000 bags are still being transported to Zhejiang every month. Also, fresh and salted goods have also increased in price due to transportation difficulties. However, the price of bamboo shoots has fallen due to the congestion of goods arriving from various villages and the inability to transport them to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Foreign Oil Tankers Have Been Approved to Enter Ningbo Estuary. Since the Ningbo Estuary was declared closed on the 5th of this month, all ships have been prohibited from entering or leaving. It is now learned that private sailboats have been approved, and those with a pass flag are still allowed to enter or leave the Ningbo Estuary. At the same time, the regular Ningbo route has also been approved, and the Tianbao and Gaodeng steamers have resumed operation. Recently, the three oil companies, Asia, Mobil, and Texaco, have applied for permission for oil tankers to enter the port, and have been approved by the garrison command, still according to the previously promulgated temporary navigation regulations, with Asia granted three times, Mobil three times, and Texaco two times.</p>
<h3>Flag Issue - Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>Reply Telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>After the flag dispute occurred in the French Concession of this city, the relevant organizations in this city telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate. The reply telegram is as follows: The French Concession forcibly unloaded, confiscated the national flag, and arrested residents. I have received your telegram. After checking, the ministry has negotiated with the French embassy on this matter, and has been approved to reply that the national flag has been returned, and the arrested residents have also been released, etc. The flag issue is still under negotiation. Special reply. Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Visits Refugee Area - Praises Highly</h3>
<p>More Than 38,000 Refugees Rely on Daily Provisions</p>
<p>French Ambassador Cosme, because of the high praise of Father Jacquinot de Bésange's Nanshi Refugee Zone, wished to see the facilities and living conditions of the refugees in the area. He specially visited yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, accompanied by French Consul General in Shanghai Baudot and two aides. Father Jacquinot and Gu Lun, director of the general office, accompanied them to visit the Chenghuang Temple Main Hall refugee food warehouse, the Yanhai Road First Refugee Hospital, the Wanzhu Street Ci'an Hospital, and more than ten shelters. The ambassador praised the zonal management of the area, which was well-organized, and the emphasis on cleanliness and hygiene in the area. The visit ended at around 11:00 AM. The refugee area is now divided into eight zones for management, with 88 shelters. There are currently more than 38,000 refugees and poor residents relying on the office to provide daily provisions.</p>
<h3>American Donated Wheat for China - Second Batch Will Be Shipped to Shanghai Next Month - Totaling 8,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The American Red Cross is continuing to donate the second batch of American wheat, totaling 12,000 bags, to relieve Chinese refugees. It has already been shipped to China by the American ship "Potocki." Among them, 4,000 bags will be donated to Chinese refugees in South China, and the remaining 8,000 bags will be handled by the American Consulate in Shanghai. According to Red Cross sources, the batch of American wheat will arrive in Shanghai in early next month and will be distributed to charitable organizations in various places for the purpose of relieving refugees.</p>
<h3>American 10,000-Ton Cruiser Sailing to Shanghai Tomorrow - Also Coming Is the Flagship of the Asiatic Fleet - Other Ships Will Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the American 10,000-ton cruiser Astoria, which recently carried the ashes of former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito back to Japan, and the flagship of the American Asiatic Fleet, the Augusta, will arrive in Shanghai on Saturday. The Astoria will be berthed at buoys No. 4 and No. 5, where Japanese ships are usually berthed. The Augusta will be berthed at a buoy opposite the Customs Wharf in the middle of the Huangpu River. According to the current plan, the Astoria will arrive in port at around 10:30 AM on Saturday, and will only berth for one day, and will sail to Manila the next morning. The ship's soldiers can go ashore for a tour on Saturday afternoon. The Augusta will stay in Shanghai for several weeks, and then sail to the waters of North China, and is expected to return to Shanghai in late June or early July. Also, Admiral Hart is scheduled to succeed Admiral Yarnell as the commander-in-chief of the American Asiatic Fleet around July 15. Other ships of the Asiatic Fleet, such as destroyers and submarine squadrons, are scheduled to set sail from Manila in late May or early June and arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Ship "Promise" Detained Again: "Prosper" Negotiates for Release, "New Life" Remains Docked in Hong Kong and Not Detained</h3>
<p>After Japanese warships arbitrarily inspected and detained merchant ships of various countries, hindering international shipping in China, the ten Portuguese merchant ships, including the "Tangbei," were detained. Despite protests from the Portuguese Consul-General, the Japanese authorities, using the excuse of unclear nationality, delayed their release. Now, the Norwegian merchant ship "Promise," represented by the Pacific Shipping Company, was loaded with 5,000 bags of flour and 140 pieces of general cargo in Shanghai on the 20th of this month and sailed to Fuzhou. The company has not received any telegrams from the shipowner confirming its arrival in Fuzhou. Based on the scheduled voyage, it should have already arrived. Moreover, the company sent telegrams to call for it, but there has been no response. Now, an Associated Press report from Hong Kong confirms that the ship was detained by a Japanese warship en route from Shanghai to Fujian. It is reported that the company will wait for full confirmation of the ship's detention before reporting it to the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai to negotiate with Japan. Additionally, the Norwegian merchant ship "Prosper," represented by the New Chang'an Company, loaded wood planks and general cargo in Fuzhou on April 18th and sailed to Shanghai. It was detained by a Japanese warship and forced to sail to Taiwan. The company has reported this to the Norwegian Consul-General in Shanghai and requested negotiations with the Japanese side. Furthermore, the "New Life" ship, also represented by the New Chang'an Company, is currently docked in Hong Kong, and reports of its detention are inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Trade Approaching Unification: Improved Market Control, Increased Transaction Volume</h3>
<p>Regarding rice prices in Shanghai, since the last sharp increase, transactions among brokers have been extremely chaotic. Some sell directly without going through the market, and others trade privately at prices that do not match the market rate. Consequently, market prices have been inconsistent. The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee believes that if this kind of long-standing problem is not quickly stopped, it will worsen over time, reduce legitimate market transactions, and diminish the effectiveness of management. As a result, regulating the food supply and controlling prices for Shanghai residents will be impossible. They are actively planning sound methods to correct this situation. Since the supervisors led brokers to implement improvements one month ago, market transactions have gradually increased. Although it is difficult to guarantee that direct transactions between brokers are completely eliminated, they have indeed decreased. At the same time, rice industry groups have diligently persuaded individual members to unify prices. Although Shanghai rice prices have fluctuated slightly in recent days, the amount is very small. This is related to the quantity of supplies from inland areas and the amount of sales, but it has no impact on the overall rice market.</p>
<h3>Chinese Military Authorities Officially Deny: Ji Xingwen Has Not Died and Is Not in Shanghai, but Still Commanding at the Front</h3>
<p>A Reuters report from Chongqing on the 27th stated that Chinese military authorities here officially deny the news of Ji Xingwen's death in Shanghai. They stated that Ji Xingwen is neither in Shanghai nor ill, but is commanding troops at the front.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Ministry of Transportation" Covets All Property Rights of the Dredging Bureau: Recently Requested Takeover from Japan, Awaiting Response from Various Countries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dredging Bureau, an international organization, has been completely paralyzed since the end of the year before last, when the Japanese side towed away more than 30 dredging vessels and survey boats, including the "Jianshe Hailong," "Haihu," and "Haibao." All dredging work on the Huangpu River has been completely suspended for 17 months, leading to the accumulation of sediment on the riverbed, which has significantly affected shipping. Since the establishment of the puppet "Maritime Administration Bureau" by the puppet "Reformed Government Ministry of Transportation" on North Sichuan Road in Hongkou, in addition to issuing a false "proclamation" in an attempt to lure foreign ships to register, it has recently turned to Japan and requested to take over all movable and immovable property of the Dredging Bureau, control the Huangpu River dredging work, and assign the position of engineer in the bureau to a Japanese person. It is rumored that the Japanese side has agreed to this principle and is awaiting consultations on the details of the takeover. It is now awaiting responses from various countries. If no one comes forward to oppose it, the ownership and work of the Dredging Bureau will soon fall into the hands of the puppets.</p>
<h3>Indian Prince Departs Shanghai Yesterday: Continues World Tour</h3>
<p>Prince Kapurthala of India, the second wealthiest man in the world, and his son, who are on a world tour, arrived in Shanghai on the Italian mail ship "Baika Meno" on Tuesday. They were received by Clayton of the British Consulate and are currently staying at the Cathay Hotel. It is learned that the Indian prince left Shanghai yesterday to continue his voyage. Prince Kapurthala visited Shanghai once 35 years ago and this is his second visit. He rules over 650 square miles in India with a population of approximately 300,000.</p>
<h3>Trade Association Urges All Industries to Handle Commissions</h3>
<p>The Trade Association of the Refugee Relief Association, recognizing that there are more than 300 trade associations in Shanghai, but only about half have handled refugee donations, has issued another notice strongly urging all industries to decide to handle refugee donations to benefit the disaster victims. The original letter is excerpted below: "Respected Sirs, The refugee problem in this city is becoming increasingly serious. It is everywhere, and all who have feelings cannot help but shed tears and give money. Although various trade associations and philanthropists have generously donated to allow refugees in the city to barely survive, it is now summer, and the heat is returning, and medicine is urgently needed to prevent unforeseen events. However, due to limited funds, there is no solution. Therefore, in addition to further fundraising, we also ask your trade association to handle business commissions starting today to support charitable efforts. We hope to receive a reply."</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees Find New Land in Africa: Intention to Allocate Land in Abyssinia for German Jewish Refugees to Cultivate</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that a letter from Vienna received here yesterday (26th) revealed that the Italian government has already allocated a large area of fertile land in Abyssinia for German Jewish refugees to cultivate and develop. The letter was sent by a Jewish relief organization in Vienna, whose organizers are the Dutch millionaire Kitmister and the Austrian Kofler, the owner of the largest brewery in Central Europe. The purpose of the organization is to help poor Jews leave Germany. Many Jewish refugees in Shanghai have received assistance with travel expenses from them. According to the letter, the Italian government has expressed its willingness to provide all possible cooperation to allow Jewish refugees to cultivate in Ethiopia. A large area of land has been allocated for the organization to distribute to Jewish refugees who are willing to colonize the Italian territory in Africa. Therefore, please report the names and other details of Jewish refugees in Shanghai who are willing to go to Ethiopia.</p>
<h3>Hongkou HSBC Bank Denies Selling Property: Would Consider Selling if Offered a Reasonable Price</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that the rumor that the Hongkou branch of HSBC Bank has been sold has been denied today (27th). However, Mr. Han Zhimeng, manager of the Shanghai branch of HSBC, told reporters this morning that if someone offers a reasonable price, he would be willing to sell the property. To date, HSBC Bank has only received proposals to lease the building. Although there have been mentions of purchasing the property, there have been no concrete proposals. Because the building is on the west end, he would be willing to consider a reasonable price. It is reported that the Hongkou branch of HSBC Bank is located at the corner of Broadway and Huade Road. Since the outbreak of the war, it has been operating at the office on the Bund. HSBC Bank has a large amount of property on Xiaoshadu Road and plans to open a branch there.</p>
<h3>Postal Remittance Bureau Resumes Telegraphic Transfers to Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate remittances to their hometowns for Guangdong natives traveling to Shanghai, the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, in addition to resuming money orders in February of this year, has now learned from a reporter from the New Voice News Agency that telegraphic transfers to the entire province of Guangdong have been resumed. The charging method is the same as for telegraphic transfers to other regions. In addition to paying the usual remittance fee, if the telegram does not exceed 20 characters, the fee is one yuan and two jiao and five fen, plus a handling fee of one jiao. For telegrams exceeding 20 characters, an additional one jiao and two and a half fen will be charged. For each short comment attached by the remitter, the charge is two jiao and five fen per word. As for Beijing, Hankou, Xiamen, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, Kaifeng, Jiangxi, and other places, the service has not yet been restored. Also, starting today, a supplementary water fee of two fen per yuan will be charged for the entire postal area of Hebei.</p>

<h3>Puppet Army of Xu Hongfa Forced to Leave Pudong: Under the Coercion of the Japanese Army, Part of the Force Has Set Out to the Front Lines</h3>
<p>The "puppet army" of Xu Hongfa in the area of Shangchuan in Pudong has been continuously recruiting bandits and expanding its power, and the motley crowd now numbers more than 2,000. It is learned that the Japanese side, due to excessive casualties at the front, has ordered this "puppet army" to be transferred to replenish the battle. According to people from Chuansha, a batch of "puppet army" has been dispatched to other places under the suppression of the Japanese army. The "puppet army" originally had no combat power to speak of, and they are all timid and afraid of death. Therefore, before the departure, many deserted at the Chuansha railway station.</p>

<h3>Hankou's Past and Present Are Vastly Different: Foreigners Can Hardly Gain a Foothold, Foreigners Arriving in Shanghai Describe Their Suffering in Hankou: The Most Luxurious Hotel Has No One, Soviet Embassy Counselor Refuses to Meet Journalists</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the American warships Isabel and Wake brought 23 Americans, 11 Soviets, 4 Swedes, and 1 Norwegian from Hankou and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (26th) afternoon. Their general attitude is that Hankou is no longer a commercial center for foreigners and is the place they least want to reside. There are many reasons for this, mainly:</p>
<p>The following items: (1) Hankou has no water. Although the authorities claim that the water taps are open from 9 to 10 am and from 1 to 3 pm, there is no water when they are opened. It is not their fault. (2) Business between foreigners and Chinese is not thriving. (3) Japanese merchant ships continue to transport Japanese goods, but foreign goods are prohibited. (4) Puppet figures are likely to increase anti-foreign activities. (5) The Japanese army imposes restrictions, and foreigners cannot move freely. Most of the American expatriates arriving in Shanghai yesterday were church workers, and a few were businessmen, including Fitz Simon of Mobil Oil Company. It is heard that the kerosene business in Hankou is almost at a standstill. Currently, the Japanese warships are the biggest user of oil in the area, and most of the oil is transported by Japanese naval oil tankers. Coal is still difficult to obtain. It seems that there is plenty of food, but the use of electric lights is also restricted. Water is often insufficient. The Japanese army is trying to facilitate public convenience and restore normalcy, but it is not easy. The remarks made by Fan Liev, a reporter from TASS stationed in Hankou, who returned to Shanghai yesterday, can be seen as a glimpse of the lack of commerce in Hankou. Mr. Fan originally stayed at the Deming Hotel. When he left the hotel on the Wake and returned to Shanghai, the hotel</p>
<p>There was not a single guest in it, and the Swiss manager became a watchman. The Deming Hotel is the largest of its kind in Hankou. Before the fall of Hankou, the hotel was often full of customers, but now there are no travelers. Foreigners arriving in Shanghai also stated that the number of Japanese expatriates in Hankou has been increasing, and a thriving commercial district has been established, where transactions are conducted only in Japanese yen, and the customers are all Japanese. Chinese who are forced to return to Hankou have little surplus money to buy other things besides essential items such as food. As for the number of Japanese expatriates in Hankou, the figures vary. The lowest number is three thousand, and the highest is five thousand, but they all admit that it is continuing to increase. In the French Concession of Hankou,</p>
<p>Everywhere you can see Japanese people building houses. The French Concession authorities issue permits allowing them to enter. Japanese geisha houses have also begun to appear in the French Concession. There are about 300 foreigners still staying in Hankou. Due to restrictions, social life is not very active. Soviet Embassy Counselor Tayrabarin and his wife also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, but Mr. Tay refused to meet with journalists. It is said that he is quite exhausted, and if he decides to talk to journalists, it will be after he has rested.</p>
<h3>China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks Lay Out a Financial Network in the Interior: Carried Out in Four Phases, to Be Completed by the End of the Year: Efforts to Handle Discounting and Loans to Assist in Rural Construction</h3>
<p>The Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, in addition to organizing joint offices and discounting committees to vigorously regulate national finances, have also been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to jointly carry out the layout of a financial network in the interior, closely coordinate, and step up work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lay out a financial network: Recognizing the importance of finance in the rear, the China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks, through the decision of the Joint Office of the Four Banks, are setting up a financial network in the southwest and northwest provinces as a pioneer in economic development. Those currently being planned in Sichuan Province are Jin, Taihe, Nanbu, Mianyang, Guangyuan, Youyang, and Daxian. Other provinces such as Gui, Qian, Dian, Shanxi, Long, and Sui are also planning to establish branches successively in four phases, to be completed before the end of this year. After the completion of the financial network layout, the finance of the rear will be linked and connected, laying the foundation for future recovery. The prosperity of the interior depends on this.</p>
<p>Handling discounts and loans: The total amount of loans released by the Four Banks Discount Committee after the war has reached more than 20,000 yuan. The recent balance is still more than 70 million yuan. Local industries such as agricultural products, salt, hardware, electrical materials, and shipbuilding, as well as various manufacturers, all businesses directly or indirectly related to military affairs, can receive assistance from the four banks, thus making capital turnover flexible, increasing production, and doubling exports. Other work, such as lending money to store grain and maintain financial institutions, has also achieved remarkable results. The Discount Committee has become widespread in major cities across the country. The amount of discounts in Shanghai and Chongqing is more than 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>Revival and construction: Recently, the government has strongly advocated dispersing the urban population to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The four banks have taken the initiative to allocate funds to build houses in nearby villages. They have now sent personnel to inspect suitable locations and are rushing to design them in order to complete them as soon as possible for the evacuation of citizens. The estimated cost is 10 million yuan. At the same time, in view of the fact that cities such as Zhushi have been severely bombed, resulting in the destruction of most of the prosperous areas, the Guizhou Provincial Government is actively planning for revival and has requested loans from the four banks to build city housing. The four banks have agreed to provide loans to assist in the revival.</p>
<h3>May 1st: German National Day</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily News on the 27th, it is heard that May 1st is German National Day. At that time, the German Consul General will hold a tea party at the Garden Club at No. 454 Haig Road to entertain foreign guests.</p>
<h3>Interview with a Celebrity: Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Spirit of Serving the Community: His Life Was Devoted to Loyalty, Faithfulness, Diligence, and Thrift: Decades of Struggle Have Convinced Both Chinese and Foreigners: Old News and New Transcriptions Are All Anecdotes of Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Chinese Team of the Merchant Corps: Since the end of the case of the riot in the public hall, I have had two thoughts: (1) Chinese municipal power, (2) Chinese self-defense force. I am determined to achieve these two things. I first sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting that more Chinese be elected as directors of the Municipal Council to participate in municipal affairs. Later, the reply only allowed me to be one person. I thought that the proposal was too far from the goal and that it was necessary to demand it jointly. Therefore, I initiated the establishment of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and all leading merchants of various professions residing in the concessions joined the organization. Its authority was no less than that of a Chinese representative committee, and the future Chinese directors were planned to be produced from this. However, after prolonged disputes, it was a pity that there was no result. When the police went on strike, the International Merchant Corps came out to maintain order. Not only was there a lack of communication due to language barriers, which often caused disputes with passers-by and residents, but also the interests of the Chinese were often ignored, which further proved the importance of the Chinese self-defense force. The so-called self-defense force is the armed class of civilians. In the concessions, the International Merchant Corps is its self-defense force. However, Chinese merchants have no knowledge of martial arts, so it is necessary to train them first. Therefore, I initiated the establishment of the Chinese Merchant Gymnastics Association and invited leaders from various industries to join. The expenses were shared by each industry. A training ground was opened in Zhabei (the original site of the current Huaxingfang and Hua'anfang), and merchants who had studied at foreign schools and practiced military exercises were hired as instructors. After the advertisement was published in the newspaper, although many people signed up, they all hesitated when it came to wearing the yellow cloth exercise clothes and hats. Therefore, Mr. Hu Jimei, Mr. Yuan Hengzhi, and I took the lead in wearing these clothes and hats and walking in public to set an example. Everyone enthusiastically joined, and there were as many as four or five hundred people who participated in the exercises. After more than a year of practice, the level of progress improved day by day. It was then agreed with the Shanghai Municipal Council to add a Chinese team to the International Merchant Corps. The team commander was selected from the members of the Gymnastics Association to fill the position. I also issued a guarantee for each of them to ensure their behavior. I exhausted my heart and my words to achieve this result. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council still had two restrictions: (1) The captain of the Chinese team must be a British person, (2) Chinese team members must receive guns from the Shanghai Municipal Council when exercising, and they must be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council after the exercise and not taken home. At that time, the merchants of the whole port and all the team members believed that the above two points were intentionally discriminatory by the Shanghai Municipal Council and expressed their dissatisfaction. I thought that this was a matter of qualifications and credit and that it could not be achieved by a momentary argument. It depended on human effort. Therefore, I encouraged everyone. Since then, the team members' service performance has been excellent, and their character and behavior have been noble. I believed that the time had come, and I began to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to allow all Chinese team members to take their guns home. At this point, the treatment of the Chinese team of the International Merchant Corps was completely equal to that of the merchant corps of other countries, and the Chinese team's service spirit and self-love were praised by the people of the country. Therefore, merchant corps and defense corps were successively organized in Hunan, Zhabei, and various provinces and ports, and the revolutionary army even relied on the power of the Nanshi Merchant Corps to recover Shanghai. The fact that a group that served the community actually served the country was perhaps the result of the Chinese team of the International Merchant Corps.</p>
<p>Ningbo Commercial and Savings Bank and Ning Shao Company</p>
<p>It is observed that the commerce of all countries takes shipping and banking as the vanguard. I intend to imitate this and wait for an opportunity to act, and the pre-planned steps are to focus on the hometown first and then the country. At the end of the Guangxu Dynasty, there was only one Chinese bank, the China Merchants Bank, but the sovereignty was in the hands of foreigners, and loans were only convenient for officials and dignitaries. Therefore, I had the idea of establishing the Ningbo Commercial and Savings Bank and also handling savings, in order to facilitate and popularize it among the people. The name "Ningbo" was used to conform to the principle of focusing on the hometown first and then the country. Also, the water journey from Shanghai to Ningbo can be reached in one night, and the number of people traveling to and from Ningbo is particularly large. At the end of the Guangxu Dynasty, only the Beijing of Taikoo and the Jiangtian of China Merchants were operating on this route. The journey was indeed a case of demand exceeding supply, and the steerage fare was one yuan per person, which was more expensive than other routes. Therefore, a French person organized the establishment of the Oriental Company, which added large ships to operate, and Taikoo and China Merchants jointly reduced prices to compete with each other, and the steerage fare was reduced to five jiao. Later, after a year of stalemate, the three companies agreed to form an alliance and raised the fare to one yuan. I contacted the three companies separately, requesting that the steerage fare be limited to five jiao forever. Otherwise, the people of Ningbo would create their own company and operate their own ships. After repeated consultations, permission was never granted. Therefore, I invited fellow villagers to initiate the organization of the Ning Shao Company. However, at that time, some of the more advanced fellow villagers who traveled to Shanghai were unwilling to provide support due to other reasons. Fortunately, the people's intelligence gradually opened up, and the general ordinary industrial and commercial circles supported it quite a bit. Through hard work, the company was able to be established. The wharf is the only tool for the shipping business. At that time, the better sections of the Huangpu River were all occupied by foreigners. Therefore, the company first negotiated with the Japanese to lease the Toyo Company wharf east of the Waibaidu Bridge, but it was unsuccessful. Then, it negotiated with Sande Hall to lease the wharf south of the Waiyangjing Bridge opposite the French Consulate, but it was also unsuccessful. Later, it chose the Bund at the 16th Pier; however, the coastline south of the 16th Pier in Nanshi was all leased by the Dada Steamboat Company. The shareholders of the company were also related to the Oriental Company, so it was also unsuccessful. The company had no choice but to petition the Governor-General of Liangjiang in Nanjing and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce in Beijing. With the help of Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong, it was able to lease the land and engage in the construction of warehouses. Therefore, it adopted the same steerage water and the same industry on the same route and jointly reduced prices, from insisting on a fare of one yuan to reducing it to two jiao, hoping to use capital strength to defeat Ning Shao. Fellow villagers worked together and organized a shipping maintenance association, raising cash. The association sold tickets to the outside world, setting the price at three jiao. The association recognized and subsidized the shortfall, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan. The unity of the Chinese nation gradually attracted the attention of foreigners. (3)</p>
<h3>Shifting of Financial Center Inward: Rapid Increase in Southwestern Banks; Various Banks Centralizing Strength to Merge Operations; Utilizing Floating Capital to Develop the Interior</h3>
<p>Shanghai has always been the financial center of the nation. After the war, the center is shifting to the southwestern provinces, especially Chongqing and Kunming in Sichuan and Yunnan. The reserve funds of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank have long been moved to safe areas. The number of branches of the West China Bank and South China Bank has increased dramatically. Various banks are advocating for merging operations to concentrate their strength. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Wartime Distribution of Bank Branches: Banks are categorized by the geographic distribution of their head and branch offices. East China has 87 head offices and 573 branch offices; North China has 16 head offices and 347 branch offices; Central China has 11 head offices and 279 branch offices; West China has 17 head offices and 195 branch offices; South China has 12 head offices and 199 branch offices; Northeast China has 30 branch offices; Northwest China has 3 head offices and 26 branch offices; Overseas has 12 head offices and 42 branch offices. In total, there are 158 head offices and 1,691 branch offices, totaling 1,849 offices. Compared to before the war: (1) Head offices decreased by 3 in East China and 1 in West China; (2) Branch offices decreased by 12 in North China, increased by 1 in East China, increased by 12 in Central China, increased by 28 in West China, increased by 29 in South China, and increased by 6 overseas.</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Branches of Chartered Provincial and Municipal Banks: Banks are classified as commercial savings banks, agricultural and industrial banks, and specialized banks. Commercial savings banks decreased by 3, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 1, and specialized banks decreased by 2. (Branch offices) Central and chartered banks increased by 23, provincial and municipal banks increased by 33, commercial savings banks increased by 7, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 1, and specialized and overseas Chinese banks each increased by 1. The following is a record of various banks in the past two years: (1) Central and Chartered (previous year) 4 head offices, 491 branch offices; (last year) 4 head offices, 514 branch offices; (2) Provincial and Municipal (previous year) 26 head offices, 464 branch offices; (last year) 26 head offices, 497 branch offices; (3) Commercial Savings (previous year) 73 head offices, 408 branch offices; (last year) 70 head offices, 415 branch offices; (4) Specialized Agricultural and Industrial Overseas Chinese (previous year) 61 head offices, 264 branch offices; (last year) 58 head offices, 265 branch offices.</p>
<p>Paid-Up Capital of 400 Million Yuan: Regarding the paid-up capital of banks, provincial and municipal banks increased by 3 million yuan, commercial savings banks increased by 1 million yuan, agricultural and industrial banks decreased by 800,000 yuan, and specialized banks decreased by 1.4 million yuan. The following is a record of the paid-up capital in the past two years: (2) Central and Chartered (previous year) 167.5 million yuan; (last year) 167.5 million yuan; (3) Provincial and Municipal (previous year) 76.884 million yuan; (last year) 79.884 million yuan; (3) Commercial Savings (previous year) 83.248 million yuan; (last year) 84.248 million yuan; (4) Agricultural and Industrial (previous year) 29.486 million yuan; (last year) 28.686 million yuan; Specialized (previous year) 19.539 million yuan; (last year) 18.139 million yuan; (6) Overseas Chinese (previous year) 57.645 million yuan; (last year) 57.645 million yuan. The above units are in thousands of yuan. As of 1938, the total paid-up capital of various banks was 436.1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Concentrating Strength and Merging Operations: In the past, the problems with banking operations lay in mutual competition rather than cooperation. As a result, financial strength had several negative impacts on society and the economy. Before the implementation of the new currency system, there was competition in speculation on real estate, bid bonds, public debt, and foreign exchange. Only after the implementation of the new currency system did things gradually move towards legitimate avenues. To concentrate strength, the banking industry advocated for merging operations. In fact, the Jiang Zhe Bank merged with the Chung Hwa Bank, the Taiping Bank merged with the Kuo Hua Bank, and the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank jointly operated with the Jiangsu Bank. After the war, the Sichuan-Kangting Bank, Chongqing Civilian Bank, and Sichuan Commercial Bank merged to become the Sichuan-Kangting Civilian Bank. Guangdong Industrial and Sichuan Silk Industry merged with the Guangdong Provincial Bank.</p>
<p>Utilizing Floating Capital to Develop the Interior: After the war, all banks in Shanghai experienced a surplus of floating capital. Therefore, banks in Shanghai and other places appropriately reduced deposit interest rates to alleviate the burden. However, entrusted by depositors and for their own future, banks, after repeated and careful consideration of the use of funds, believed that utilizing floating capital to develop the interior was the most appropriate approach at present. At the same time, it could assist the government in completing the construction of the interior and developing the rich resources of the southwest. Simultaneously, the Guangdong Provincial Bank and the Fujian Provincial Bank, among others, established special agricultural departments one after another, using all their strength to develop agriculture in the interior, striving to increase agricultural products to facilitate the export of local goods. In addition, some banks, in response to complex social and economic structures, established trust departments to handle trust matters. As for the closure of banks after the war, in reality, there were only three, but Hengli has already announced its resumption of business.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Jiangyin: Closing American Church Hospital; The Reason Given is Failure to Register with the Puppet "Ministry of Health"; The Church Has Reported to the Shanghai Consulate for Action</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Japanese troops are continuing to infringe on the rights of foreigners in the occupied areas. At the end of last week, officers from the Japanese military's special affairs department closed the Jiangyin Hospital, run by the American Presbyterian Church. The reason given was that the American doctors at the hospital refused to register with the puppet "Reformed Government" Ministry of Health. According to church personnel, the matter has been reported in detail to the authorities at the American Consulate in Shanghai, who have agreed to take action on behalf of the church.</p>
<p>However, what official action will be taken has not been confirmed here as of last night. It is reported that the Jiangyin Presbyterian Church suffered only minor damage during the fighting in the area. However, after the city fell, a "suspicious" fire broke out in the church buildings. Although there were no fatalities, nineteen to twenty-two church buildings were indeed</p>
<p>burned to the ground. The destroyed buildings included a hospital and two schools. Only the former boys' dormitory, a nurse's residence, and the residence of a Chinese doctor remained. The two schools have now withdrawn from Jiangyin and relocated to the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. The undamaged Jiangyin school buildings are now being used as a sanatorium, managed by the elderly Dr. Moffett, who has lived in Jiangyin for over thirty years and has done much to help with relief efforts during and after the war.</p>

<h3>Research on the Foundation of Love</h3>
<p>— Co-authored by Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor, and Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, at the intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>(Time) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Closed on Sundays</p>
<p>...Love grows in the spring, do not waste the good times...</p>
<p>This is a pressing issue for married couples or unmarried lovers. In this happy spring season, some couples indeed have deep affection like the sea, and their joy surpasses flying. They give birth to clever children, organize happy families, and live harmoniously, with endless happiness! However, there are also many couples who, even in this bright moon and clear wind of the spring evening, enact tragedies of sleeping in the same bed but having different dreams, or even quarreling and losing harmony! Spring should be the season for love to grow, but now love is shaking or being destroyed in the spring. Why is this?</p>
<p>Our research on the foundation of love cannot do without these three major elements: environment, mood, and innate instincts. If couples feel that they are always stuck at home, lacking interest, then take advantage of this bright and sunny season to go to the garden or the countryside for a small stroll, or take a short trip. Once you gaze upon thousands of miles beyond, seeing pairs of butterflies flying, pairs of fish swimming, and myriad colors decorating the embroidered spring scenery, at this time and in this scene, both your minds and eyes are pleased, and their love will surely increase a hundredfold. This is an example of how the environment increases love. In addition, if a man gets good news outside, or does something satisfactory, or gets an unexpected amount of money, at this time, because of his happy mood, the love between him and his wife will surely increase a hundredfold. Therefore, love is closely related to the environment and mood, and smart couples will surely be able to make good use of it.</p>
<p>However, although love has a great relationship with the environment and mood, the main foundation is innate instincts. A smart and strong husband will surely be able to use the environment, create an environment, to cultivate the mood and please the mood. So this is not a problem. If a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been promiscuous and indulgent, or has been injured by worry and labor, resulting in seminal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, and infertility after long marriage, then even in this good time and beautiful scenery, when the mood is happy, love will surely vanish in an instant. However, his wife, unable to get comfort and feeling that her years are wasted, can she not be sad and angry? Family tragedies mostly arise from this. The only way to remedy this is to take the "Reproductive Element," a strong animal gonad preparation, which is the most effective treatment. Because this agent can produce sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate blood circulation, and nourish nerves after taking it, continuing to take it will surely cure all of the above symptoms completely in a short period of time, and can also achieve the effect of prolonging life. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hemitot's Sperm Consolidation Pills" to consolidate the sperm gate and stop the leakage, then both the root and the symptoms will be treated, and the effect will be even faster. If patients can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by expert doctors and then receive various scientific treatments such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Beauty</p>
<h3>New Methods for Breast Development</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Beautiful breasts can indeed increase a woman's beauty. The so-called curves are undoubtedly completely controlled by the breasts. If there are no high breasts, is it possible for the curves to be rich and exposed? I think it is naturally impossible. Therefore, breast development has almost become a required course for modern women. In view of the inability to reach the standard of development, they do not hesitate to use various methods to pass off fish eyes for pearls. However, when the curtain of the spring boudoir comedy opens, this trick is still exposed, and men see it as worthless, or even give cold words and sarcasm, making her ashamed to have no place to go!</p>
<p>But why do women have this defect? According to the results of research by famous Chinese and Western gynecologists and myself, it is considered to be entirely due to various reasons such as malnutrition, masturbation, leukorrhea, major illness, perennial malarial fever, irregular menstruation, and failure to recuperate after childbirth, which leads to impaired ovarian function and affects metabolism. Therefore, the breasts become loose and withered, even flat like a man's, the hips are thin, the muscles are withered, and what makes them feel hateful is that even at the age of youth, their foreheads are already covered with wrinkles. With such an ugly woman, if she wants to win the love arena or win the husband's heart, is it still possible? The only way to remedy this is to take the ovarian preparation female "Reproductive Element," which is the most effective treatment. This agent was invented by the German medical saint Dr. Steinach after more than thirty years of arduous experiments, and has been proven by many famous European and American doctors to have peaceful medicinal properties and great efficacy. Regardless of various women's hidden diseases, they can be completely cured in a short period of time. If continued, not only can it turn withered breasts into high breasts, but it can also eliminate uterine diseases, promote pregnancy function, beautify the face and blacken the hair, and prolong youth.</p>
<h3>The Tragedy Encountered by Young People with Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>The sexual distress of young people is indeed present. However, you should have rich reason to guide you onto the bright road, why be driven by the temporary impulse of passion and fall into the abyss. We also know that the sexual desire during the period of spring passion is strong. However, you must not commit masturbation because of sexual distress. You should know that after one masturbation, there is a tendency to commit it a second time, and it is easy to develop into a bad habit. Once the bad habit is deep, nocturnal emission is almost inevitable.</p>
<p>Semen in the body functions to promote developmental function, invigorate metabolism, and nourish nerves in all parts of the body. If nocturnal emission is treated early, the damage to the body is less and it is easier to cure. If you delay and muddle through, it will inevitably lead to exhaustion of essence and depletion of blood, then developmental function will be blocked, leading to incomplete development, and some parts will be as short as a finger. The metabolic function will decline, and the brain, spinal cord, and sex, the three major nerves, will be destroyed. All kinds of symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and dreaminess, back pain, premature ejaculation and impotence, thin semen and infertility will follow. This kind of youth is sick and in pain, not only will they fail in academics and career and be abandoned by society, but also because of their sallow and thin appearance, they will not be liked by women and will fall into the pain of unrequited love. In short, what he encounters is nothing but tragedy!</p>
<p>At this time, the most reliable effective treatment for nocturnal emission is to take "Hemitot's Sperm Consolidation Pills." Because this agent can consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves after taking it, nocturnal emission can be cured naturally. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above symptoms, you must also take the gonad preparation "Reproductive Element" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continuing to take it will surely restore health completely as soon as possible. If patients can come to this clinic in person to be diagnosed by expert doctors and then receive various symptomatic treatments such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Why Does Gonorrhea Recur?</h3>
<p>Experienced clinicians must strive to completely cure gonorrhea for the sake of the patient. They will never give up their sacred responsibility halfway and use brutal drugs, clumsy surgery, or perform improper treatments, causing the condition to be forcibly suppressed, leading to future troubles.</p>
<p>For example, in the acute stage of gonorrhea, doctors use strong washing methods or brutal drugs in order to gain the patient's trust. As a result, the discharge of pus temporarily stops, the urine becomes clear, or only two or three strands of gonorrhea are seen during urination. At this time, doctors often tell patients that your illness is completely cured and does not need to be treated anymore. However, many patients often relapse after a few days at home. You should know that the pathogens of gonorrhea not only breed on the entire surface of the mucosa, but also often penetrate deep into the mucosa or spread to the adjacent accessory organs, where they re-form lesions. Therefore, even if strong washing drugs are used, even if the symptoms on the surface of the mucosa are fortunately cured, the adjacent accessory organs will relapse. You should know that the presence of gonorrhea strands in the urine is of course not a complete cure, and even if the urine looks clear to the naked eye, it cannot be determined that it has been cured.</p>
<p>To avoid the above drawbacks, only the use of German Leuren-Pingliu electrotherapy and ultra-special chemotherapy can quickly eliminate gonorrhea. Because Leuren-Pingliu electrotherapy has a wide and deep powerful bactericidal power and can clarify its toxins, and it is even more complete with ultra-special therapy and agile and painless surgery. Then, because the bactericidal power is very thorough and the toxins are clarified, once cured, there will be no recurrence.</p>

<h3>Renfeng Factory Workers Accuse Factory Owners of Embezzlement; Alleging Factory Owners Embezzled Over 40,000 in Dividends; Defendants Deny This and Await Sentencing</h3>
<p>Xu Tingkeng (38 years old, from Nantong, residing at 152 Difeng Road), the current factory owner of Shanghai Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Xie Keming, the former factory director from Ningbo (46 years old, residing at 160 Edward Road), previously filed a private prosecution in the criminal court of the Special District Court against Zhu Gengtao (52 years old, from Jiading, residing at 94 Masnan Road), the general manager of the factory, for breach of trust and embezzlement. The first instance has just been judged. Now, Cao Xingbin, Wei Tingzhu, Jiang Lianqing, Xi Yufa, Chen Minkui, Yao Linsheng, Zhang Fuguan, and other 77 employees of the Renfeng Factory</p>
<p>jointly hired Wu Chuliang and Xie Ju, two lawyers, to file a private prosecution in the criminal court of the Special District Court against Xu Tingyu, Xie Keming, Zhu Gengtao, and others, the factory directors and manager of the Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, for jointly embezzling bonuses, requesting a legal investigation and ordering the funds to be handed over for distribution. According to the complaint, the plaintiffs are employees of the Renfeng Factory with very low monthly salaries, ranging from two to ten yuan, and rely on year-end bonuses to maintain the lives of their families. The Renfeng Factory’s annual</p>
<p>surplus, after deducting public accumulation, is distributed according to fifteen shares. Shareholders receive ten shares each, while employees and managers each receive two and a half shares. The surplus for 1936 reached 650,000, but the defendants only claimed a surplus of 170,000 and distributed 25,000 yuan, concealing more than 41,000 yuan. Now, during the case of Xu and Xie suing Zhu Gengtao, Zhu confessed that the surplus for 1936 was 650,000, meaning the defendants embezzled the bonuses. It is requested that a legal investigation be conducted. The court, according to the complaint, held a hearing with Judge Zhu Chuzhe.</p>
<p>Because the defendants did not arrive, the order was changed to a different time. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, another court hearing was held. The plaintiffs, Cao Xingbin, Chen Minkui, and Yao Linsheng, accompanied by their lawyers, attended the court and stated the circumstances of the embezzlement by the defendants. The defendants, Xu, Xie, and Zhu, accompanied by their defense lawyer, Chen Wencan, attended the court. According to Xu Tingyu, there was no embezzlement of bonuses. There are no fixed rules for annual bonus distribution. In addition to the employee bonuses, there is also a public fund distributed every three months, generally</p>
<p>at a rate of six or seven yuan per yuan of salary. The other two defendants, Xie and Zhu, were questioned. Xie Keming stated that the Renfeng Factory was originally founded by me, and I sold it to Xu Tingyu in 1935. Zhu Gengtao stated that there was no embezzlement. The plaintiffs also stated that Xie and Xu are related by marriage. Because of the Jinde Bank incident, Xie superficially sold the factory to Xu, but in reality, he is still the boss. The court verified the statements and, considering that the case was simple and clear, ordered that the debate be opened and then announced its conclusion, with sentencing scheduled for May 1.</p>
<h3>Shui Mingda: Abandoning His Victim After Seduction; Seduced a Young Girl and Abandoned Her; Court Orders Out-of-Court Settlement</h3>
<p>Fan Liu, a woman from Jiangyin residing at 8 Dongshengli, Dongxinqiao, in the British Concession, acting as the legal representative, accompanied by her daughter Fan Yueying, 19 years old, hired lawyer Liu Liang to file a private prosecution in the criminal court of the Special District Court, stating that Yueying was seduced by Shui Mingda, the son of Shui Fuxiang, a compradore for the Haifu Shipping Company residing at 63 Mercer Road, to a hotel in September of the lunar calendar last year, and after they had relations, a marriage agreement was made, setting a date for the wedding. However, after reaching his goal, Shui Mingda</p>
<p>abandoned her and ignored her. The girl is now six months pregnant. When approached, Shui avoided meeting. It is requested that a trial be conducted for the crime of disrupting family relations, and a supplementary civil suit is filed, seeking compensation of 2,000 yuan and lifelong alimony of 4,000 yuan. The court, according to the complaint, ordered the court director, Liao, to hold a hearing.</p>
<p>Because the defendant did not appear, the hearing was postponed. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, another</p>
<p>court hearing was held. The defendant, Shui Mingda, accompanied by his defense lawyer, attended the court. His parents and third older sister were also present in court to listen. The plaintiff, mother and daughter, also attended the court with their lawyer. According to Fan Liu, her daughter was seduced, and I went back to my hometown, so I didn't know. When I came to Shanghai and saw that my daughter was pregnant, I asked and found out. Now, if the defendant marries my daughter, then I have no objection. Otherwise, I request that he be prosecuted. Fan Yueying stated that the defendant's third sister opened</p>
<p>a room in the Dafang Hotel, with the window facing my sister's residence. I was seen by the defendant at my sister's place. On September 15, he waited for me outside the alley and took me to a hotel room. After I became pregnant, he abandoned me and ignored me. I looked for him but couldn't meet him, so I came to sue him. The marriage agreement was written by the defendant himself. Shui Mingda admitted to having a relationship with the girl and making a marriage agreement, setting the wedding for October of this year. They first met at the Great World, and his parents agreed to the engagement. The court verified the statements and ordered both parties to reach an out-of-court settlement. The hearing was rescheduled for May 11. The defendant was released on bail by his defense lawyer.</p>
<h3>Bandit Gang Plots Robbery of Pig Brokerage, Encounter Mishap on Arrival, Rob Officer of Handgun and Flee, Culprits Subsequently Arrested and More Accomplices Captured</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:15 PM, four bandits suddenly appeared at the accounting room of the Longtai Pig Brokerage, located at numbers 4 and 5 of the Xuehua Fang on Xuehuali Road in the French Concession. Two of the bandits were armed with handguns. The bandits initially entered through number 4, intending to proceed to the accounting room at number 5. However, upon reaching the reception hall of number 4, they encountered a young woman sitting there, holding a baby in her arms. Upon seeing the intruders wielding handguns, the woman recognized them as troublemakers. She threw the baby to the ground and ran into number 5, shouting for help to catch the thieves. Realizing their plan had gone awry, the bandits abandoned the robbery and fled through the doorway. At that moment, Yuan Hefu, the security guard of the lane, arrived upon hearing the alarm and was about to draw his handgun. Unexpectedly, one of the bandits spotted him first and pointed his gun at Yuan, restraining him and seizing Yuan's handgun. They then fled north along Xuehuali Road, through Pingyuan Fang, across Jiaeryi Ai Road, and towards Dapu Bridge. Upon reaching Xujiahui Road, they turned around and saw Yuan Hefu, the security guard whose gun they had stolen, still pursuing them relentlessly. The bandits then fired two shots in the air as a warning. However, by this time, only two bandits remained, as the other two had already escaped midway. The two bandits then hailed two rickshaws on Xujiahui Road, intending to escape by taking the opportunity, but Yuan continued to pursue them closely, shouting as he chased. Coincidentally, a Chinese constable, badge number 56 from the French Concession police, was returning home on a bicycle. Hearing the alarm, he joined the pursuit, passing through Tailasituo Road, Fulili Road, and arriving at Beidang Road. The number 56 Chinese constable ran to the Beidang Road police station to report the incident. A large number of detectives were immediately dispatched to surround and capture the bandits. As a result, two bandits were intercepted by a detective on the spot, and two handguns were found on them, one of which was the one stolen from Yuan. They were immediately taken into custody. After a strict interrogation by the police chief, they identified themselves as Li Rusheng and Qiu Yishou, both from Zhenru. One of the bandits had a gunshot wound on his arm, which he claimed was accidentally inflicted by his companion when firing a warning shot midway. At the same time, the two bandits also revealed the addresses of their accomplices. Two people were apprehended in room 340 of the Dongya Hotel in the Public Concession, and seven people were apprehended near a certain location near Dongxin Bridge. The case is currently under further investigation.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Car Crash, Mrs. Li Li and Western Police Chief Both Lose Memory, Remain in Comatose State</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that in a car crash on Broadway on Sunday evening, Western Police Chief Wimsett was injured and suffered a concussion. He has lost all memory of the events leading up to the accident. As a result, personnel from the Public Concession Police Department have been unable to further investigate the circumstances that led to the tragic accident. Doctors caring for Mr. Wimsett have attempted to question the injured Western police chief, but it is said that the injured party immediately forgot everything after the accident. It is unheard of. It is reported that Mr. Wimsett not only does not remember any of the details of the collision, but also cannot even remember getting into the car of Mr. and Mrs. Li Li. Doctors hope that Mr. Wimsett will soon recover from this condition and be able to speak. Mrs. Li Li was still unable to speak to police yesterday. It has now been confirmed that Mr. Wimsett was originally stationed at the Waibaidu Bridge when he was summoned by a foreign couple, apparently Mr. and Mrs. Li Li. According to witnesses, Mr. Wimsett was standing near the sentry box of the British West Fortress Highland Regiment when he was summoned to assist Mr. and Mrs. Li Li in resolving a traffic dispute. A Japanese navy spokesman denied on Tuesday that the Li Li's car had reached the Waibaidu Bridge after being held up by wire mesh obstacles on Broadway Bridge.</p>
<h3>Claims to be Artificial Silk Salesman, Scams Silk Firm Out of Payment, Continuously Frauds to Cover Up, Case Exposed, Arrested and Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Li Genfu, a local resident who used to be an artificial silk salesman and lives at number 86 Fujian Road, recently claimed to be a salesman at the Japanese-owned Kawabe Ichiyo Foreign Firm at number 223 Sichuan Road. He solicited goods from various silk firms. Li contacted Mr. Chen, the manager of Hengfengtai Silk Firm at number 284 Guangdong Road, by phone, offering to sell ten boxes of artificial silk, stating that the price was 335 yuan per box, with payment upon delivery.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the funds, Mr. Chen sent his younger brother, Chen Genquan, to Kawabe Ichiyo Foreign Firm to meet with Li Genfu. After handing over the payment of 3,350 yuan, five boxes were immediately delivered, with the remaining five boxes to be delivered one hour later. However, after waiting for a long time, Chen did not see the goods arrive, so he inquired about Li, who kept dodging, claiming that the goods had already been sent out. Chen Genquan then requested to go with Li to find them, but to no avail. Knowing that he had been deceived, he handed Li over to the Old Gate Police Station, which transferred him to the General Patrol Police Station. Detective Zhu Wanjun questioned Li, who admitted to the fraud. He claimed that of the funds he received, 1,675 yuan for the five boxes had already been paid, 1,000 yuan for the remaining five boxes had been returned to Liu Ganyuan, 600 yuan had been deposited with the old treasurer Xu Acai, and 75 yuan had been used as Xu Acai's transportation fee. It turned out that Li had used the same trick on the 20th of this month to swindle 1,226 yuan from Liu Ziyuan, a silk merchant at number 19, Taian Lane, Tiantong Road. Because Liu was pressing for repayment and he could not make up for it, he used the method of "cutting flesh to mend sores" and defrauded Chen Longquan out of funds to return to Liu. After the detective verified the confession, he went to Liu Ziyuan and Xu Acai at number 36 Shenchang Lane, Haining Road, and recovered 1,600 yuan of the stolen money. Li was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the Criminal Court No. 4 of the First Special District Court, who prosecuted him for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code and stated the above situation. According to the reports submitted by Liu Ziyuan and Chen Genquan, the representative of Hengfengtai Silk Firm, who clarified the details of the deception, Li Genfu's confession was evasive. Judge Dai Rongduo verified the confession and ordered Li to be detained to await sentencing on May 4th. The recovered stolen money of 1,600 yuan should be returned to Chen Longquan for collection. The organization has always been fully committed to animal protection work, such as investigation and publicity, and has achieved remarkable results, which has greatly benefited society and people's hearts, not only reducing unnecessary suffering for livestock.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I read in your newspaper's local news column on April 26th that your lawyer represented Mrs. Wei in a case against Locke Qiu for damages, requesting mediation from the Second Special District Court, saying that Kaituo Wei is the alias of Gan Weilu. This is not in accordance with the facts, because the client entrusted to our lawyer is a female transliteration Kai Wanwei, which is very different from your newspaper's description of Gan Weilu's alias Kaituo Wei, etc. I am afraid that the inaccurate words will be passed on and become untrue, which will affect the fairness and integrity of our lawyer's handling of cases, so I hereby send a letter to clarify and ask for correction, and I am very grateful for it. Sincerely, Lawyer Tang Huaiqun, April 27th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have just read the news in the local news column of your newspaper on the 23rd of this month, "Drug Agency Cracked in Xujiahui," and the main culprit is at large. I was very surprised when I read it. It concerns my reputation and is of great concern to the police, so I have to state the details and ask for correction, which I will be very grateful for. I have been a doctor for more than ten years, and the profession has been passed down through generations. I hold a doctor's license from the Municipal Sanitation Bureau and have always used medicine for a living. Moreover, I am a member of the intellectual class in the medical field, and I would never dare to engage in illegal business. In March of this year, I rented out my spare room to a Mr. Chen. Only after Mr. Chen moved in did I know that he had an opium addiction. Knowing this, I was afraid of violating the ban and hindering my responsibility as a second landlord, so I repeatedly warned him to terminate the lease, but Mr. Chen refused on the grounds that it was difficult to find a rental. As a result, it has been delayed until now. Unexpectedly, after 12:00 midnight on the 21st of this month, after I had already fallen asleep, Chinese and Western detectives suddenly came to my place to search, saying that someone had reported that I was selling opium and drugs. After a thorough search, only a set of smoking paraphernalia and a small amount of opium were found in Mr. Chen's room, with no morphine or other drugs. Therefore, Mr. Chen's family of three and the smoking paraphernalia were taken to the police station for questioning. Because of my relationship as the second landlord, I ordered my wife to go to the police station with me to be questioned. However, the police station only imposed a fine for the matter of opium smoking. Unexpectedly, I now see a newspaper report that is very inconsistent with the facts, making irresponsible remarks and spreading rumors. It can be seen that someone must be against me, deliberately slandering me and destroying my reputation. I cannot cover up the truth from the public, and the police station has a record to prove it, so I specially send a letter to request correction to set things right. This is my sincere prayer. To the Editor of the News Department of the Shenbao, Wang Huikang respectfully, residing at 55 Zhenbei Street, Xujiahui.</p>
<p>The meteorological forecast from Xujiahui Observatory at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong is sunny, very warm, with fog, and strong northwesterly to southwesterly winds.

<p>The gloom of the past few days has been swept away by news, no, facts, that are enough to excite. This is the recapture of Nanchang, this is the British conscription.</p>
<p>Originally, the gain or loss of a place is insignificant in our overall war of resistance plan, so major cities can sometimes be abandoned, but Nanchang is very important; according to reports, it has been recaptured, and Kaifeng has been attacked and defended multiple times. Therefore, now, our army's attack on Nanchang is not only saying that it is gratifying that our army has recovered Nanchang, but also that it is gratifying that our army has the strength to attack Nanchang. If Nanchang can be attacked, what place cannot be attacked! The strength of our army can be seen at a glance, who is not excited by it!</p>
<p>Speaking of the United Kingdom, since Chamberlain decided to curb the ambitions of the aggressors, he has been preparing for war in many ways and through many procedures, but until recently, it seems that there has been no substantial achievement, which is inevitably disappointing. Now, the government he leads has resolutely and decisively implemented the conscription system. The achievement of this move, I think, is no less than the effective implementation of the anti-aggression organization. Because: first, from now on, the United Kingdom will be prepared, and will not be afraid of the event, blindly accommodating the aggressor; second, France, the Soviet Union, and other democracies will be more at ease with the United Kingdom, knowing that she will not use other countries as cat's paws to take chestnuts from the fire for her. The determination of the United Kingdom, for the first time, is actually seen in action, who is not excited by it!</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot be satisfied with excitement. Because excitement is mostly temporary and lacks permanent value. Therefore, in addition to this decisive excitement, we must still calm down and promote these exciting facts so that they finally become a satisfying victory.</p>
<p>I hope that under this excitement, our compatriots across the country, whether in the front or the rear, can strengthen our strength so that our final victory can be realized as soon as possible. After attacking Kaifeng and then attacking Nanchang, we have indeed embarked on the road to victory.</p>
<p>I hope that under this excitement, the United Kingdom will no longer waver and will indeed be able to do it effectively so that the aggressor has no means to use his tricks. In fact, Huntington's recent return to office, Hitler did not see him, the foreign minister did not see him, only the director saw him, which can also be said to be a great humiliation. Under this stimulus, at least he should wake up!</p>
<p>I believe that spirit surpasses everything, as long as everyone is determined, a satisfying victory will surely be realized soon, and it will be more than just exciting facts!</p>
<h3>Drizzle</h3>
<p>— Jiaqi</p>
<p>Outside the window, a misty drizzle began again, so fine it resembled the tip of an autumn hair, flying onto the glass, blurring the window.</p>
<p>The drizzle flew to the earth, tiny droplets merging together, and the earth became wet.</p>
<p>The drizzle flew onto people's faces, like steel needles, piercing their skin with pain.</p>
<p>The drizzle flew onto people's bodies, seeping into the gaps of their clothes, so wet they could be wrung out.</p>
<p>This drizzle, falling time and again, continuous and incessant. What is it for, after all?</p>
<p>The earth is covered with dust, filth, baseness, and shamelessness. It suffocates people's breathing, obscures their vision, taints the innocent with dirt, and oppresses the noble into the lowly. Demons seize the opportunity to run rampant, and the world seems to be going mad.</p>
<p>People, in this situation, have completely lost their reason, as if under an incurable spell, unable to distinguish anything, without the slightest resistance, prostrating themselves under the demons' feet, allowing themselves to be played with and humiliated.</p>
<p>The endeavors that people undertake, having lost their masters, all come to a halt. What can be destroyed is destroyed, what can be sullied is sullied, unable to release any more radiant light to assist humanity. The entire society immediately regresses, never to move forward again.</p>
<p>Darkness swallows the whole world.</p>
<p>The drizzle, unable to tolerate this state of affairs, unwilling to endure it any longer, wants to wash and cleanse the world, drive away the demons, so that dust, filth, baseness, and shamelessness will never grow again. It gathers its courage, though its power is so small, yet it unyieldingly, once, twice, thrice, flies on, flies on, flies on.</p>
<p>The glass window is blurred, urging people to wipe it clean, banish the darkness, and see the light again.</p>
<p>The earth is wet, urging people to wash away the dust and filth and attain clarity.</p>
<p>The pain on people's faces is urging them to wake up, to stop dreaming, and quickly extinguish the external attacks.</p>
<p>Seeping into the gaps in the clothes, it is urging people to have the courage and perseverance to stop the demons' erosion and to strive to resist!</p>
<p>Falling time and again, it trains people to have the enduring spirit to fight and not to stop halfway!</p>
<p>Oh, the continuous drizzle, how great it is!</p>
<p>We uphold the spirit of struggle, we receive the drizzle's hint, we purify our society, extending it to the entire earth, the light is ahead!</p>
<p>The misty drizzle flying outside the window is a bright lamp dispelling darkness!</p>
<h3>Among the Reeds</h3>
<p>— Sifang</p>
<p>!! One Night at Zhao's Ferry</p>
<p>Zhao's Ferry is a desolate little crossing on the Huangpu River. Hidden in the reeds, few boats anchor here, making the silence all day long terrifying. The wind blows through the reeds, rustling eerily.</p>
<p>Now it is evening. The evening tide of the Huangpu River beats against the beach, its roar like a mournful cry. The reed beds are buried in the thick of the night, bowing their heads as the night wind whistles mournfully past, causing those heads to sway left and right.</p>
<p>In the dark sky hangs a pale moon, like the face of a corpse, scattering its faint light, making everything seem even more sorrowful and mournful.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a rustling sound comes from the reeds. There are also the sounds of footsteps moving in the shallow water, and faint whispers, mixed with the weeping of the wind, rising and falling, making it difficult to hear clearly.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, there is no sound, only the river shouting in a heavy voice, great clumps of foam swirling and rushing to the beach, rolling into the reeds.</p>
<p>The moon is covered by a cloud, with no trace of light, and everything is as black as ink.</p>
<p>From the reeds, a very faint, but rapid breathing sound is revealed. Amid the shouting evening tide of the Huangpu River, the sound of wooden oars splashing through the water rings out.</p>
<p>A small boat is rowing swiftly over from the opposite bank.</p>
<p>From the inky blackness of the night, it can be vaguely seen that five or six people in yellow clothes are sitting in the boat, all with guns on their backs, their eyes wide open like those of eagles, greedily watching the dark night sky. Some are whistling happily, sometimes uttering loud laughter.</p>
<p>—Row faster!</p>
<p>A shout, like a sudden thunderclap, bursts out in the silent night, and the sound of the oars splashing through the water becomes more urgent, and the boat moves faster.</p>
<p>In the reeds, there is a slight stir, and footsteps move in the water.</p>
<p>—Quick! Get ready! Old Chi's boat is getting close.</p>
<p>There is a low command, followed by a low murmur between each other, and then everything is quiet again, with only the wailing of the night wind, the lapping of the tide, and the sound of wooden oars striking the water in the middle of the river, like a somber symphony being played together.</p>
<p>The small boat gradually rows closer to the shore, and the people on the boat laugh happily.</p>
<p>—Bang!</p>
<p>The first gunshot rings out from the reeds, followed by a rapid burst of gunfire. The bullets shoot towards the small boat, like hard hailstones mixed in a violent rainstorm, and a puff of thick smoke pours out of the reeds, with flames flashing in the dark night sky.</p>
<p>By the time the men in yellow jump up in surprise and raise their guns to aim, two have already fallen on the bow of the boat, fresh red blood flowing from the bow into the river.</p>
<p>Endless bullets shoot out of the reeds, and the bullets from the boat shoot aimlessly into the reeds.</p>
<p>The quiet Zhao's Ferry is now lively, with bullets whistling through the air like madmen. The shouts from the reeds are like angry roars coming from thousands of throats, and the flames turn half the sky red.</p>
<p>An hour later, the burst of gunfire has passed, and the flames have been extinguished, leaving the stench of gunpowder and blood mixed and floating in the quiet air.</p>
<p>On the Huangpu River, a small boat has capsized, and several corpses are rolling with the waves, the turbid water mixed with fresh red blood.</p>
<p>Fresh red blood also flows into the river from the reeds, and some people are groaning in agony, but their cries are drowned out by the heroic shouts and songs of joy.</p>
<p>By this time, dawn has broken, and the morning light shines into the dense reeds.</p>
<h3>Axis Blocked</h3>
<p>— Lihua</p>
<h3>Kong Yunting and Rousseau</h3>
<p>— Qiongfu</p>
<p>— A Record of Beneficial Reading</p>
<p>Kong Yunting, in the preface to his "The Peach Blossom Fan," narrates the story of the play's circulation, with these two points:</p>
<p>"After 'The Peach Blossom Fan' was completed, princes, dukes, officials, and gentry all borrowed copies, creating a paper shortage. On the evening of Yimao, a eunuch urgently sought 'The Peach Blossom Fan.' I gave him a carefully transcribed copy, forgetting where the original manuscript was. Then, I found a copy at the home of Zhang Pingzhou, the grand censor, and presented it to the imperial residence at midnight, thus entering the imperial palace."</p>
<p>"In the fourth month of Gengchen, after I had resigned from my post, Master Mu'an invited me to see 'The Peach Blossom Fan.' At that time, officials from the Hanlin Academy and the provincial governments all gathered, letting me sit alone in the seat of honor, ordering the actors to toast me in turn, inviting me to critique the play.</p>
<p>The guests whispered and pointed, with a quite proud air."</p>
<p>One can see at a glance that the author takes pride in this. But this cannot bear close scrutiny. "The Peach Blossom Fan" "mainly expresses the pain of the fall of the Ming Dynasty," but the author is pleased to receive the Qing Dynasty emperor's attention and the Qing Dynasty princes and officials' support, which is truly incomprehensible. Is this really proof of what some of our "scholars" claim, that the work and the author's personality are completely unrelated?</p>
<p>But let it be, let those "scholars" be happy. However, this makes me think of an ancient Frenchman who was once denounced by our "scholars."</p>
<p>Rousseau, in the eighth volume of his "Confessions," narrates the scene when his opera "Le Devin du Village" was performed, which is somewhat similar to Kong Yunting's proud scene. He says that he, as the author, was also sitting in a box, and opposite him were the emperor, the queen, and all the figures in the court. He, with his beard unshaven and his clothes unchanged, sat there high, listening to the praises and comments of the aristocratic ladies around him. He also narrates the scene after the performance, which is more enviable than what Kong Yunting took pride in. He says that the next day, the emperor was going to summon him and personally give him an annuity.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Rousseau was a mortal enemy of the emperor and the aristocracy. Even the successful play at that time, although it is now generally recognized as a mediocre work, still expressed the emotions of the common people and promoted his ideas. But he described the emperor and the aristocracy being so kind to him in such a way that it seemed he himself was taking pride in it. This is clearly like Kong Yunting, slapping himself in the face.</p>
<p>From this point of view, our "scholars" should not have denounced Rousseau. Didn't Rousseau also help prove the opinions of the scholars?</p>
<p>But don't rush to conclusions. Although Rousseau narrated that he sat with the emperor and the aristocracy, he was proud of being unadorned, sitting with the emperor and the aristocracy in the clothes of a commoner. Then he greatly elaborated on the reason why he didn't shave his beard or change his clothes, meaning: I'm watching my play, to hell with it. Although he also narrated that the emperor wanted to see him, he immediately said that he didn't want to see the emperor, and even used sarcastic language to say some reasons why he didn't want to see the emperor. Rousseau was, after all, a bit of a "killjoy," and in the end, he gained nothing to be proud of like our Kong Yunting.</p>
<p>In the end, China has something that foreign countries may not have. Rousseau is not a pleasant person, and I now understand why our "scholars" want to denounce him.</p>
<p>But don't rush to conclusions. If you have read the great work of one of our "scholars" introducing "Confessions," when you read the above two paragraphs, you will be surprised. Rousseau sitting with the emperor and the aristocracy was introduced; but Rousseau's elaboration that he looked down on the clothes of the upper class was completely banished from "civilization" and was not seen at all. The emperor wanting to see Rousseau was also introduced; but Rousseau's sarcastic words about not wanting to see the emperor were translated into two sentences with a changed face. It turned out that our "scholar" insisted on making Rousseau exactly the same as the literary writers in our history. This work was considered a success. It's just that those "scholars" who denounced Rousseau didn't seem to have seen this great work, which is a pity, a pity.</p>

<h3>A New Chinese Opera is in the Making</h3>
<p>— Xialuo</p>
<p>The Ouya Theater Company Renames Itself the International Theater Company. The International Grand Theater is Scheduled to be Completed Before the End of This Year</p>
<p>Some call Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera "Chinese opera." Can Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera be considered "Chinese opera"? Let's not talk about it for now, but it is a fact that a new Chinese opera has not yet been established.</p>
<p>Indeed, we have also seen "Storm on the Yangtze River" (unfortunately, the playwright and star of the play, Mr. Nie Er, has passed away), and more recently, we have seen "The Poppy Flower," written by Wu Xiaobang, with music composed by Chen Gexin, and performed by students of the Sino-French Theater School. These are all samples of new Chinese opera, but in terms of quality and quantity, we are still not satisfied. Especially, without a permanent organization to do the pioneering work, it is very difficult to establish a new opera that can survive on its own.</p>
<p>What should be the content and form of the new opera? This awaits discussion by experts and is not allowed by this short space. However, it can be generally imagined. On the one hand, it should absorb and melt the strengths of European and American operas. On the other hand, it will also have China's own inherent components. The two will merge, and the new Chinese opera will be established.</p>
<p>What I want to report to you here is the news that a new Chinese opera will be born under a plan.</p>
<p>We probably won't forget that not long ago, the Lyceum Theater performed the opera "Carmen." The Ouya Theater Company performed this play. Although "Carmen" was a French opera in that performance, the Ouya Theater Company, which performed the play, was quite ambitious to establish a new Chinese opera. After the performance of "Carmen," they were even more enthusiastic about this point. Now the plan has been decided, and with the increase and expansion of the organization, the name has also been decided to be changed to the "International Theater Company."</p>
<p>The International Theater Company's plan is roughly divided into four departments: (1) The original French opera troupe will soon travel to Saigon, Hanoi, Java, and Singapore to perform. During this travel performance, they plan to invite several opera talents from France again, and then establish a performance network in Saigon, Hanoi, and Shanghai, so that they can perform in rotation in the future. There is no problem with theaters in Saigon and Hanoi, because the French government is quite supportive of the arts, and the French authorities there will definitely give them a good theater. As for Shanghai, they plan to build a theater themselves. (2) This theater, in addition to performing foreign operas, also plans to perform Chinese operas and dramas, and even improve Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera, so that it is the most complete and suitable theater for performing dramas and operas in terms of equipment, and the programs staged are also a full warehouse of spiritual food. The name of the theater is the International Grand Theater, located in the central area of the French Concession, quiet in the midst of the hustle and bustle, and the transportation is very convenient. The design of the theater is being drafted, and the shares have been almost raised. For the remaining balance, it is planned to be publicly raised soon. (3) As for the group that performs new Chinese operas, it has recently been organized, and the script is being written. What can be reported to readers is that they have held several script discussion meetings. Starting next week, they will also begin rehearsals. The name of the company is the International Opera Company. The relationship between the International Opera Company and the International Art Theater Company is equivalent to the drama organization of the Sino-French Friendship Association and the Shanghai Theater Company. The names and addresses of the participants, etc., must be kept secret for the time being. This is to apologize to the readers; what can be "revealed" is that they have decided to use new people as much as possible for the members (especially the actors), so as not to cause conflicts with the drama aspect, so as to avoid dispersing manpower. Fortunately, since the new opera is a new pioneering work, it makes more sense to let new people pioneer. (4) At the same time, in order to cultivate new opera cadres and talents, they also plan to set up an opera training class. This batch of new blood can not only improve the level of future performances, but also, in terms of quantity, when the opera movement develops in the future, they will indeed need them to enrich and lead it, just like the drama now, which needs new blood to supplement and enrich it. Although the establishment of the opera training class will be after the work of the opera company has taken steps, they have also begun to look for a house, because the work of the opera company is believed to be able to get on the right track soon.</p>
<p>Although most of these plans are still on paper at present, they have already begun to be implemented, so they will soon be concrete and will be able to see some results. For example, the International Grand Theater is scheduled to be completed before the end of this year, and by that time, the opera of the International Theater Company should have been premiered long ago.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "Spring Grievances in the Western Palace"</h3>
<p>— Ruhua</p>
<p>“Girl School”</p>
<p>Produced by Columbia Pictures, Shown at the Grand Shanghai Theater</p>
<p>"Spring Grievances in the Western Palace" tells us about the situation of a girls' school in the United States (in fact, it can also be said to be a general one). This situation also falls into the almost "foreign countries have it, we also have it" situation. For example, this journal once published an "Unofficial History of the Drama Circle," in which Miss Wang Ping was expelled by the school authorities for acting, which was considered to be "defaming the school's reputation." And the "storms" caused by "love" in general are also very many. The dormitory headmistress checks the students' letters, and the girls' dormitory is like a forbidden palace, but is such careful prevention actually perfect? I don't need to answer this. The occurrence of "storms" is the most accurate answer. Naturally, young girls should be cautious about their "lifelong events," but going too far can also be counterproductive and more harmful!</p>
<p>In "Spring Grievances in the Western Palace," Lin Lian was expelled by the school authorities for not returning one night. The reason for the expulsion was "defaming the school's reputation." However, when Lin Lian's father, Xin Puson, was willing to "invest in the construction of a library and donate it to the school," the principal also "stopped the matter." In this way, people can't help but think that the term "school" as a "learning shop" is not an excessive satire. Moreover, "Spring Grievances in the Western Palace" has even greater satire, that is, the last female teacher, who is over the age of flowers, is the first to elope with her lover. This may be "acting," but people are always people, after all, and it is a fact. Is it the best "management" method to lock those young female students in the "palace" like prisoners?</p>
<p>We do not oppose the strict prevention of the school authorities, nor do we oppose expulsion for "violating school rules," but when using the beautiful term "defaming the school's reputation," we should think about whether this "management" method is reasonable and whether there is any "inadequacy." Because after an "accident" has occurred, the school authorities should at least bear some responsibility!</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that "Spring Grievances in the Western Palace" is a relatively meaningful script in exposing the "hypocrisy" of some schools. However, because the director's skills are weak, it just tells us such a "story" in a straightforward manner, and the power of satire cannot be seen at all. At the same time, such as the atmosphere of the girls' school, and the initial discord between Lin Lian and Laiteli, and then becoming friends, its process is also insufficient. That is, the most lively scene in this film—the party, is also not outstanding.</p>
<p>The few actors are also mediocre.</p>

<h3>Substitute Mail</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Lanting:</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your comments on the illustrations of "Heroic Little Warriors." At the same time, we will encourage ourselves and will never fail the readers' enthusiasm for loving this publication, but the last point, the facts are the most powerful proof, and you can ask the master to release your worries. And I hope that other readers can give us comments at any time, and I am very lucky.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Early California</h3>
<p>— Boming</p>
<p>Recently discovered records in California, USA, have led to new discoveries regarding the extent to which Chinese participated in gold mining and railroad construction in California. It is well known that Chinese laborers built the western end of the transcontinental railroads in the United States and Canada, but few people know about the participation of Chinese in early gold mining in California. The attached drawing shows Chinese engaged in gold panning and railroad construction, which was originally published in an old newspaper and is now reprinted from the "Sino-American Chronicle," the organ of the Sino-American School in the San Francisco area, which provides education for Chinese orphans.</p>
<p>According to an article in the newspaper: The first Chinese to emigrate to California landed in San Francisco on the American sailing ship [missing ship name], in February 1848, with two men and one woman. The woman worked as a domestic servant in the Gillespie family, and the two men went to work in the newly discovered gold mines. Other news also said that Chen Ming (transliteration), who sold tea, fans, shawls, and other Oriental goods, arrived in California in 1847. Then, Chen Ming arrived earlier than the three. Chen also joined the gold rush and earned a lot of gold. He immediately wrote to his friend Cai Yun (transliteration) in Guangzhou. Soon Cai Yun and his wife also went to California to seek gold.</p>
<p>The news of the discovery of gold in California caused almost as much of a sensation in Guangzhou as it did on the East Coast of the United States. The Chinese called it Gold Mountain, and still use this name to refer to California. At the end of 1848, there were only seven Chinese registered in California, but by January 1850, there were already 800 people: by the end of that year, there were 4,000 people; and by the end of 1851, the number had increased to 12,000; according to a census in 1860, there were almost 30,000 people; in 1870, there were more than 60,000 people; and in 1880, the Chinese population reached an unprecedented height, with more than 100,000 people.</p>
<p>Due to the special social situation caused by the discovery of gold, the Chinese in San Francisco engaged in the laundry business. Later, this activity spread throughout the United States. The symbol of "gentlemen" and those who became rich by panning for gold in California in the early days was a starched white shirt, but it became a real luxury because everyone was engaged in gold panning and there were few women, so washing white shirts became a serious problem, and laundry fees became excessively expensive. Many people sent their shirts to Honolulu by ship for washing, which was indeed more economical. At that time, the diligent Chinese felt that this was an excellent opportunity, so they engaged in washing and starching white shirts. As a result, Chinese laundries sprung up everywhere and were very popular, and were called "mutual benefit associations."</p>
<p>However, many Chinese went into the mountains to pan for gold, and many also discovered large amounts of precious metals. Chinese people poured into the mines, and the wages they earned were lower than those earned by Irish immigrants, which led to prejudice and hatred, and eventually to riots and anti-Chinese movements. The same was true on the railroads. Irish immigrant laborers and native-born politicians, most of whom were Irish, had serious disputes because of the Chinese. Later, gold mining became increasingly difficult, and it was necessary to purchase machinery at great expense, so the Chinese turned to running stores, cultivating gardens, and other businesses.

<h3>CHINSE　IN　CALIFORNIF-EARLY　DAYS</h3>
<h3>Rain After the Storm</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Nine:  Sorrowful Mushrooms Bitterly Sprinkle Tears on All Sides, Frugality Cultivated Through Diligence Creates Ten Mu of Land</p>
<p>Let's talk about Mrs. Su Liya and Jin Danyu discussing the establishment of a family-style new car company. Jin Danyu said that for the sake of a trial run, the assumed capital would be three million yuan. Mrs. Su Liya calculated and said, "That kind of car costs an average of 30,000 yuan to manufacture per vehicle. Let's calculate with fifty cars, which would cost 1.5 million yuan. The remaining 1.5 million yuan will be used for various equipment. The head office will of course be located in Shanghai. We will first start a trial run on the highways of Jiangnan, setting up branches in Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. Fortunately, building houses doesn't cost too much, as long as they can accommodate the vehicles. Among these fifty cars, thirty will be prepared for family use, ten for engineers, and ten for scholars to use for exploration. Although this is a hypothetical, it has some meaning. The most common use is for family travel, preferably one husband and one wife, with at most one child. It is suitable for honeymoon travel for newlyweds. During this honeymoon, they can choose the most beautiful scenic spots, drive the car there, and stay there. Isn't that the most free? In Europe and America, we highly respect the honeymoon. I remember more than ten years ago, the large airplanes flying from America to China, like the Clippers, each had a room prepared for newlyweds to live together, for their honeymoon travel. Even today, these large airplanes have rooms for couples. Now that this type of car is popular, the honeymoon travel business alone will be quite substantial. Therefore, I plan to allocate five-thirds of the cars for family travel. It doesn't matter if there are fewer for engineers. In the future, if there are large industrial organizations, engineers will need to use such cars. They may want to create their own designs and ask car manufacturers to produce them. Whether for surveying or supervising construction, a large industrial organization should equip itself with those cars and not necessarily rent them from others. As for the cars used by scholars for research and exploration, we should certainly prepare them; however, most scholars' research is mostly done indoors, with fewer in cars. Moreover, many require different equipment, so we can only prepare fewer of them." Jin Danyu thought Mrs. Su Liya's plan was very good. However, when Mrs. Su Liya invested in establishing an enterprise in China, she was unwilling to operate it solely. She insisted on cooperating with Chinese friends. She could bear half of the capital, and the profits would be divided equally. (97)</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>From Liu Baoquan to the Cultivation of Performers</h3>
<p>— Hai Ce</p>
<p>Famous actors and actresses enjoy fame for only a short time,</p>
<p>Luck and connections have little to do with it;</p>
<p>It's all about indulging in smoking, wealth, alcohol, and lust!</p>
<p>Liu Baoquan, the King of Drum Song, is truly like Tan Xinpei in Peking Opera and Yu Hongyuan in Han Opera in the world of drum song. He is not only unprecedented, but simply unparalleled. I heard his performances when he first came to Shanghai, more than twenty years ago. The location seemed to be in the New World Variety Show. The plays I heard included "Intercepting the River and Fighting," "Battle of Changsha," "Wulongyuan," and "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats." Now it's his third time in Shanghai—the second time was three years ago, I didn't hear it. I went because of his fame back then, and because I am from the South, I couldn't fully understand his lyrics, but I felt that the beauty of his rhythm was indeed different from Bai Yunpeng. Now I can revisit the old tunes, and perhaps it's the last time. (Liu is already seventy-one years old. After returning north this time, who knows when he will come again?)</p>
<p>I saw Liu Baoquan's demeanor the other day. His face is rectangular, much thinner than in the late Qing Dynasty. His head is already bald and shiny, with only a tuft of graying hair at the back. Although he is over seventy years old, his spirit is still vigorous. Having been famous for decades, his art has not declined to this day, and his voice is still clear and bright. It is said that there is a major reason for this: he has absolutely no hobbies in his life. He dislikes smoking, alcohol, lust, and other passive pastimes. This shows that "cultivation" is of great importance to performers. Many famous actors and actresses are like昙花一现 (ephemeral), enjoying fame for only a short time before disappearing into obscurity. They attribute this to "luck" or "connections," but in reality, "cultivation" is the main reason and accounts for the largest component!</p>
<h3>Liu Baoquan's Strict Self-Discipline</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Liu Baoquan, the King of Drum Song, performed at the Da Zhonghua Bookstore in this city a few years ago. The results were very good. Even though the seat price was as high as one yuan, it was still packed every day. This proves the Shanghai people's warm welcome to his art. Liu was originally from the Pear Garden and studied Sheng roles. He was skilled in both civil and military roles. Later, seeing that there were many talented Sheng actors at the time, it would not be easy to stand out. Therefore, he abandoned acting and specialized in drum song. He had a natural voice, high-pitched, clear, and mellow, and no one could surpass him at the time. In addition, he had learned martial arts in his youth, so when he performed "Battle of Changsha," Guan Yu and Huang Zhong fighting with swords, his posture was like that of the famous Tan actors on stage. Moreover, his singing was vivid and colorful, able to move the audience and attract their spirit. When he was angry, the audience was also angry. When they heard his sorrow, the audience was also sad. His performance of "Ningwuguan" could inspire people and encourage the cowardly. His singing of "The Great West Chamber" was graceful and charming, vividly portraying the voices and postures of a talented scholar and a beautiful lady. He was truly able to imitate anyone he played. He could understand the personality and gender of the characters in the book in detail. The difficulty of drum song lies in one person simultaneously imitating the different voices, laughter, appearances, languages, and actions of men, women, old, young, civil, military, noble, and humble people. When Baoquan sang, he was not only able to imitate them vividly, but his tone and voice were also excellent, enough to overwhelm his peers. The honorable title of "King of Drum Song" was almost unanimously agreed upon by everyone. Alas, Liu can truly be called a genius in the art world.</p>
<p>Liu is now seventy-one years old and has one son and one daughter. His daughter is married to a Mr. Li from Xuzhou. His son, Shaoqing, is a graduate of Huiwen College in Peiping. He has a good foundation in Chinese and English. He usually wears a suit and leather shoes and does not resemble an artist's son at all. Baoquan has been in the singing world for decades and has accumulated a lot of savings. He does not want his son to follow in his footsteps, so he independently founded the Liu Private Primary School in the old capital. Shaoqing served as the principal and achieved remarkable results. In recent years, Shaoqing, seeing that his father was getting older and often went to other cities to perform, had to give up his school affairs to accompany his elderly parent and handle all internal and external affairs. I have been friends with Shaoqing for ten years. According to what he told me, his father is usually very strict with himself. He has certain rules for clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Here is a brief description of his general situation.</p>
<p>Liu's Clothing: He is very fond of simplicity. Most of the clothes he wears were made ten or twenty years ago. Although the styles are old, they are exceptionally clean. Before going on stage, he is polite and courteous. After bowing to the audience, he must first explain in detail the plot of the book he will sing that day, and then slowly take off his mandarin jacket. Then, holding the clapper, he begins to perform his excellent songs.</p>
<p>Liu's Food: He usually eats vegetarian food. He avoids sour, spicy, and stimulating foods. He rarely eats meat. He often declines invitations from friends to banquets. When he cannot avoid it, he asks Shaoqing to attend in his place. Over the decades, he has been able to maintain his excellent voice without any damage, which is due to his moderation in diet and avoiding unnecessary social engagements.</p>
<p>Liu's Residence: He has a house he bought himself outside Qianmen in Peiping. The courtyard is clean, and the interior is elegantly furnished. The doors and windows are opened and closed at fixed times. Liu has maintained a consistent lifestyle for decades, paying attention to air circulation and regular living. It is simple and unadorned, and does not emphasize appearance. From this, we can see a glimpse of his personality.</p>
<p>Liu's Transportation: When Liu is at home, he often exercises outdoors after meals. He walks slowly instead of riding in a car. He often goes to open areas and walks around for half an hour to aid digestion. He generally does not use a car unless absolutely necessary. His frugal style can also be taken as a model.</p>
<p>The reason why Liu can enjoy longevity and his voice becomes better with age is that there are main reasons for this: (1) He usually does not engage in promiscuity. He often sits quietly with his legs crossed, or reads scriptures and books to pass the time. (2) Every time he finishes a song and enters the backstage, he must quickly fold a hot towel and cover his head, and also cover his forehead. He lies on a sofa and reclines for about a quarter of an hour. Only after the sweat from his whole body and face has completely dried can he wash his face and change clothes and leave the backstage. When he is resting with his eyes closed, no one is allowed to talk to him or open or close the windows to avoid cold air entering. The habit of drum song is to start slow and then speed up, singing faster and faster. Even young people who sing this must be exhausted and hoarse. However, Baoquan is like a long river, flowing thousands of miles. Every word can hit the audience's eardrums. Because of this, his whole body is wet as soon as a song ends. If he does not get enough rest and let the sweat dry completely, then if the wind enters his pores, he will definitely suffer from colds and coughs, which will affect the roundness of his voice. Although this is a small matter, Liu can persevere in it and has never changed for decades, so his reputation can last forever.</p>

<h3>Impressions of the Palace Museum Photography Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>The scenery of the old capital has been in my heart for almost twenty years. I have suffered from being tied down by affairs and have not been able to see it all at once, and I can only lament my failure. A month before the July 7th Incident at the Lugou Bridge, my old friend Li Zixin had a trip to the old capital and strongly urged me to go with him. I was hindered by my duties and could not go, so I politely declined. When Li returned, the war broke out, and the old capital soon fell. I was even more distressed. My friend Dr. Ding Hong also went to visit before the war and took hundreds of photos and returned, as if taking a posthumous photo before his death. Alas, how sad! The other day, collectors in Shanghai held an exhibition of calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties to raise funds for medical expenses, and the results were remarkable. Dr. Ding, suffering from illness, also followed up with a photography exhibition of the Palace Museum, selecting more than 100 of the most exquisite works, enlarging them one by one, and displaying them in the exhibition hall. I went to visit yesterday and felt that his photographic art had reached perfection, and while allowing people to linger in the scenery, a thought of restoring our homeland arose spontaneously, so its significance is also very profound. (Attached are more than 60 portraits and foreign landscapes, which are also worth viewing.) Among them, such as the Temple of Heaven, the twelve-layer jade railing, the painted beams and carved ridges, the Nine Dragon Wall, the Imperial Vault of Heaven, and the corridor, all show the architectural beauty of our country's predecessors, while the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, the Falun Hall, the Yonghe Temple, the sunset over the Forbidden City, and the place where Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty died for his country, evoke feelings of nostalgia for the past and sadness for the present, leaving people lingering with endless thoughts. For those like me who have not had the opportunity to visit the old capital, being among them is like personally visiting with wax clogs, which is really a good source of information for lying-in travel. After watching and returning, my feelings are endless, so I composed two quatrains to show to Dr. Ding:</p>
<p>Ten thousand brave soldiers vanished in a night, the blood on Lugou Bridge was crimson,</p>
<p>The rivers and mountains are beautiful but not our land, tears flowed as I mourned the Palace Museum.</p>
<p>Looking north at Yanyun, the sky is dim and green, a catastrophe fills the sky and a flock of wailing geese cry,</p>
<p>Remembering the dreams of the past, the Palace Museum with the energy and intestines shaken.</p>
<h3>Qian Qian Studio Drama Talk (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiao Chan</p>
<p>Talking about the Skills of the Qionglin Banquet</p>
<p>Yu Shuyan's singing of the Qionglin Banquet is one of his masterpieces in his life. Whenever he went to various places to perform, he would always show this play to the audience. He also had two characteristics: one was the scene of asking the woodcutter. After asking and knowing the whereabouts of the woodcutter's wife and children, he immediately entered the stage. When the woodcutter called him back, Shuyan's demeanor of coming out of the stage door, looking like a madman but unwilling to come back, was very similar to Lao Tan, very, very good. There is another characteristic that I want to explain now. Lao Tan's exit from the box was casual, but Xiao Yu's was different. He was in the box with his head and neck resting on one end of the box opening, and his feet resting on the other end of the box opening. He used the strength of his whole body to stretch his body straight, and then rolled onto the stage from the box opening. This point is very different from Lao Tan. This kind of skill, if you ask Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, or Yang Baosen to do it now, I'm afraid they can't handle it. In terms of skills, it must be said that Xiao Yu's skill is good, but in terms of the rationality of the situation at that time, after Fan Zhongyu was injured and fainted, he would definitely not have the strength to perform like Xiao Yu, right? Therefore, I praise Xiao Yu's skills, but I do not approve of his plot. However, I must say that Lao Tan's throwing shoes and dropping them on his head in the Nao Fu scene is not necessarily something that the plot requires. It is the same as Xiao Yu's exit from the box. You can only talk about skills and not talk about rationality.</p>
<p>Lao Tan's throwing shoes and dropping them on his head is now considered to be Lao Tan's unparalleled skill of hitting the target every time. In fact, it is not so. In the three times I saw it, one time was when Lao Tan saw that the shoes were thrown with great certainty, and he listened to the shoes falling on his head without changing his expression. One time, it was thrown improperly, so he used his hand to catch it on top of his head. One time, he was afraid that the shoes would fall to the ground, so he stretched his hand over his head, and when the shoes were close to the top of his head, he retracted his hand and listened to the shoes falling on the top of his head. It can be seen that Lao Tan himself was not very sure, and he also knew that he had practiced this skill very well.</p>

<p>Old Newspaper New Excerpt (13)</p>
<h3>The County Magistrate Flings His Sleeves and Leaves in the Zhang Fuquan Case Hearing</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper from April of the eleventh year of the reign of Tongzhi of the abdicated Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Zhang Fuquan was sued by Sun Azhu in a case involving twisting the county. Because Zhang was employed by a foreigner, he was supposed to be jointly interrogated in court. Therefore, Dao Xian ordered the Chief Adjutant Chen to join County Magistrate Ye, the consul, and the translator for a joint trial. First, three people, including Li Longgui, who had helped with the twisting that day, were brought forward. County Magistrate Ye was about to interrogate them, but the Western official forbade him from speaking. County Magistrate Ye said, "If you don't want me to say a word to interrogate, why do you call it a joint trial, and why bother with a joint trial at all?" He flung his sleeves and left. Those waiting for the trial below the steps saw the county magistrate entering the inner chambers and all wanted to disperse in a commotion. The foreign patrol captain quickly ordered the doors to be closed. Chief Adjutant Chen comforted the Western official and persuaded the county magistrate, so he returned to the court. After questioning, it was clear that Zhang Fuquan should not have mistakenly believed the women working at the brothel to act aggressively and violently, privately trapping Sun Azhu. This was a serious violation of the regulations. Sun Azhu and Zhang Fuquan had a minor feud, and he gathered people in the concession to pull and drag him forcefully, which was also inappropriate. Therefore, the verdict was set, with each of the original defendants sentenced to six months of imprisonment to warn the wicked. Li Longgui and others who helped with the dragging were punished lightly, each wearing a wooden collar for five days to show a light punishment. During the interrogation, a man with short hair and a long gown, calling himself a small person, went straight to the court and stood upright without kneeling, saying that he was a witness for Zhang Fuquan. Chief Adjutant Chen beckoned him closer and asked him what was the matter. The man wanted to say something, but Sun Azhu scolded him below, "This is a turtle (cuckold), how dare he stand next to the case?" Those watching the trial couldn't help but laugh. (Note: Zhang Fuquan was originally a rogue who committed many evils. After being employed by a Westerner, he became even more unscrupulous. When he broke the law, he thought that the Westerner was enough to protect him, but he didn't know that there was public opinion on right and wrong, and the Westerner would definitely not be able to protect him.)</p>

<h3>Finance:  Expecting Hitler's Speech to be Mild, Cash Prices Continue to Prosper, Ultimately Foreign Banks Continuously Supply, Stop Rising Slightly Under the Buying Power of Hong Kong Gang</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market situation for cash 烚赤 (smelting red silver) continued to prosper, inheriting the afterglow of the previous day, and the public gradually believed that Hitler's speech today would have no impact on the axis of the European situation. Therefore, the rich and wealthy people's intention to collect and store recovered, and they competed to absorb funds through money changers. Therefore, in the morning, it soared to a high peak of 2,080 yuan. Afterwards, although money changers continued to absorb purchases, and a certain silver shop (on behalf of the Hong Kong gang) also followed suit, but the silver shop gang and gold shops took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and a certain silver shop continued to supply on behalf of foreign banks, so the rising trend weakened and gradually presented a fluctuating situation. As a result, it continued to rise by 5.5 yuan, but the range of ups and downs in the middle was still mediocre. The people's hearts were stable, and the transaction was slightly busy, about 710 taels. Silver shop jewelry was up by one yuan, customs gold was still flat, and Sino-British pure gold and other items rose again.</p>
<p>烚赤 Rose Again by Five and a Half Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the initial buying intention of money changers for each bar (ten taels) has been very strong, and the Hong Kong gang also wanted to absorb purchases. Therefore, sellers temporarily waited and watched, and the buying price was shouted up from 1,073.4 yuan to 80 yuan before a deal was seen. First, a certain money changer (on behalf of speculators in this city) entered the gold shop for 50 taels, with 2,080 yuan as the opening price, which was 8.5 yuan higher than the previous close. After the opening, a certain money changer also entered the gold shop for 50 taels, with the same price as the morning opening. Then, another money changer also entered the gold shop for 50 taels, with a price of 79 yuan. Later, the money changers did 50 taels with the same price. After that, although a certain silver shop absorbed purchases on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, it was not affected because the silver shop gang had a good intention to supply. A certain silver shop entered the trade for 100 taels and the gold shop for 50 taels, both at 78 yuan. Later, the silver shop gang sold 50 taels back to the money changers, also at 78 yuan. At that time, a certain silver shop suddenly sold on behalf of the receiving bank, so the potential was slightly weak. A certain silver shop sold 50 taels each to a certain silver shop and a certain money changer, both at 77 yuan. After that, it extended to noon and no business was seen, so the noon closing price was still 77 yuan. In the afternoon, because a certain money changer continued to absorb purchases, the initial opening was raised by 2.5 yuan. Then, a certain money changer entered the silver shop gang for 50 taels, with a price of 79.5 yuan. After that, the gold shop took advantage of the high price to sell again, and it immediately fell back. The gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain money changer, with a price of 77 yuan. Later, at 4:10, a certain money changer entered the trade for 50 taels, also at 77 yuan. However, a certain money changer still wanted to absorb purchases, and once shouted 77.5 yuan to buy, but it was still difficult to find an opponent, so no business was done. Therefore, the evening closing price was still 2,077 yuan. As a result, it rose by 5.5 yuan compared to the previous close (only 3 yuan difference throughout the day). The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 2,082 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,072 yuan. The spot gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and no business was done.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rose by One Yuan</p>
<p>Silver shop jewelry, the exchange price per tael, was not changed at first. When it came to about 10 o'clock, because 烚赤 opened at 2,080 yuan in the morning, it was raised by one yuan. There were no changes after that. Datonghang changed to 211 yuan, Xintonghang was 209 yuan, and the purchase price was 203 yuan.</p>
<p>British Gold Suddenly Rose by Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 26th: British pure gold suddenly rose by half a penny per ounce, rising to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pennies. As a result, the central bank's Chinese cash purchase price also rose to 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold was still flat, calculated at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 4 jiao, calculated at 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants and Foreign Firms Vigorously Settle Foreign Exchange: Forward Rates Slightly Tight, Spot Rates Flat</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, major foreign firms and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (acting on behalf of Japanese banking circles) aggressively bought and sold. Asiatic Petroleum and Texaco also followed suit, settling for June and July deliveries of British and American currency. However, foreign banks such as British and American ones showed slightly less interest in providing forward contracts, while remaining willing to supply spot currency. As a result, the forward market showed a slight softening. The swap between spot rates and May rates could have been eliminated, but now the British pound needs to soften by 0.015625, and the U.S. dollar tighten by 0.03125. However, the spot market was stable due to the support of foreign banks and the selling by Bombay money houses, resulting in little change. The final result was flat, with brisk trading. As for the Hong Kong dollar, foreign firms showed strong buying interest, so the transactions between yarn brokers and foreign firms were not affected, and the final result was also neutral.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London telegraphic transfers, both near and far, remained flat. The New York silver price remained unchanged. The London spot gold price rebounded by half a penny. In foreign exchange, the pound was flat against the dollar, Shanghai currency, and the French franc. The dollar was down by 0.0125 against the pound, flat against Shanghai currency, and down by 0.0625 against the French franc. The central bank's posted exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling rates of 8 pence and 25/100 for the pound and 16.0625 yuan for the dollar, both flat compared to the previous close. After the opening, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (acting on behalf of Japanese banking circles) and major foreign firms continued to buy and sell actively. However, as British and American banks continued to show strong willingness to supply currency, there was no impact. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (acting on behalf of Japanese banking circles) and foreign firms settled spot pound rates at 8 pence and 25/100 with HSBC, Mercantile Bank, and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, and also settled spot dollar rates at 16.0625 yuan with Banque Belge pour l'Etranger. HSBC's posted rates remained unchanged, and the announced silver equalization tax also remained unchanged, still at a slight 5.25%. Later, Asiatic Petroleum felt a sense of security and aggressively absorbed forward British and American currency, but foreign banks showed less interest in providing forward contracts, leading to a slight softening of the market. Asiatic Petroleum settled forward pound rates for June and July at 8 pence and 21875/100000 with HSBC. Subsequently, Texaco also purchased forward dollar rates for June and July at 15.9375 yuan with an unspecified bank. Nearing noon, trading became quieter, with a slight amount of Hong Kong dollar trading. Foreign banks, including Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms and yarn brokers at 55.875 and 55.75 yuan, a fairly stable situation. By the afternoon close, banks' spot selling rates for both British and American currency were the same as the morning opening, with the Hong Kong dollar at 55.75 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign firms and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank continued to buy and sell, but in small amounts, leading to a quieter market. First, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (acting on behalf of Japanese banking circles) settled spot pound rates at 8 pence and 25/100 with the Bombay money house. Subsequently, foreign firms purchased spot dollar rates at 16.0625 yuan from an unspecified American bank. Afterward, foreign firms absorbed spot Hong Kong dollars from foreign banks at 55.75 yuan, resulting in no change in the process. By the late close, banks' spot selling rates were 8 pence and 25/100 for the pound, 16.0625 yuan for the dollar, and 55.75 yuan for the Hong Kong dollar. As a result, the British, American, and Hong Kong currencies were all neutral compared to the previous afternoon close.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yen Plummets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot gold in London rose by half a penny, and the pound-dollar exchange rate fell by 0.0125. In the local market, foreign firms were actively settling accounts for British and American currencies, and banks were supplying them smoothly. Market prices remained stable as before. Banks were actively absorbing Hong Kong dollars, but the supply was not strong, so market prices were slightly tight. The black market opened with money changers buying and selling in sudden spurts. The supply from gold shops and customers was relatively scarce, and market prices were firm. Later, bulls took profits at high prices, and the upward trend slowed slightly. In the afternoon, money changers' absorption revived, and customer supply was also strong, showing a revolving pattern. The final result was a significant increase. There was strong demand for foreign British and American gold pounds, because forward exchange rates were soft, and the black market rose sharply. The price of British gold pounds was firm and slightly higher. Demand for British and American gold notes was very strong, and banks were absorbing large quantities. Trading among peers was very frequent, and market prices rose slightly. There was a slight supply of Hong Kong, Singapore, and rupee notes, but demand was very scarce, and prices fell slightly. Japanese gold notes were in abundant circulation, and very few Chinese people collected them. Even Japanese people entering and leaving the country were subject to restrictions. Moreover, military needs were enormous, and over-issuance was getting worse. Demand was scarce, supply was high, and the market was weak. The value was approximately one yuan. Trading at the guild was very active. Qintai sold 50 pounds of British gold notes to Dingyuan, Hengmao sold 1,000 yuan of American gold notes to Xiangkang, Xiangkang sold 10 pounds of British gold notes to Hongchang, Qintai sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Hongchang, Zhenxing sold 20 pounds of British gold notes to Hongchang, and also sold 200 yuan of American gold notes to Tongfeng, and also sold 200 yuan of American gold notes to Xiangkang. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pounds up 10 cents, British gold notes up 1 cent, American gold notes up 2 li, Hong Kong notes down half a cent, Singapore notes down 1 cent, rupee notes down half a cent, and other currencies unchanged.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Currency Reaches Its End: A New Low Price Seen Yesterday, Worth Only 76 Cents</h3>
<p>In North China, since the puppet "Provisional Government" stipulated that the use of legal tender be prohibited from March 11, forced its exchange, and imposed severe penalties, the people, due to the "counterfeit currency" having no reserves, are facing it becoming worthless paper. Although under the power and violence, they still collect legal tender.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Chinese army has not only won victories in the Jiangxi and Guangdong wars, but also achieved successive victories in Jin and Yu. The hope of winning the war of resistance is growing stronger. The people of North China are even more afraid of using counterfeit currency and do not want to accept it. As a result, the exchange rate of legal tender has become increasingly firm. Yesterday (27th), Tianjin reported that the black market rate of the counterfeit "Federal Reserve Certificate" opened in the morning, continuing to be cheaper by five yuan compared to the morning opening on the 26th. 100 yuan of legal tender could be exchanged for 130.05 yuan of "Federal Reserve Certificates," meaning that one yuan of "Federal Reserve Certificate" was worth only 76 cents and 6283524/10000000 legal tender. It can be seen that the people of North China believe in legal tender and their enthusiasm for supporting the National Government. The policy of the Japanese puppets to destroy legal tender has already been declared a failure.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops by 1.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Stabilized</p>
<p>(Tianjin) 27th Dispatch: Compared to the previous day, the exchange rate was longer by 0.125 for British currency and longer by 0.25 for American currency. The Shanghai currency exchange rate dropped by 1.5 yuan. The opening price this morning is listed below:</p>

<p>American Currency 16.25 Yuan</p>
<p>Shanghai Currency 99 Yuan</p>
<p>(The Shanghai currency is the amount receivable in Tianjin for 100 yuan of Shanghai currency)</p>
<p>"Note" The credit of legal tender in Tianjin is high. According to yesterday's market, legal tender is more expensive in Tianjin than in Shanghai. It is calculated that British currency is higher by 0.0625 pence per national currency yuan, and American currency is higher by 1875/100 yuan per national currency 100 yuan.</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) 27th Dispatch: The exchange rate opened this morning, compared to 11:30 a.m. yesterday, the British currency did not change, the American price shrank by 0.0625, and the Shanghai currency fell by 0.25 yuan.

<p>Shanghai Currency 178.5 Yuan</p>
<p>(The Shanghai currency is the amount of Shanghai legal tender equivalent to 100% of Hong Kong currency)</p>
<h3>Securities: Bulls and Bears Evenly Matched in Domestic Bonds; Principal and Interest on the Hai River Bonds Paid on Schedule</h3>
<p>The trend in the securities black market remains hovering. The bulls are still struggling. Some original bulls are exiting, while new bulls are also present, but the confidence is not as strong as before. Large investors are not pushing up prices as eagerly as before. There is a situation where one side is pushing up prices while the other side is selling. For many days, number 38 has been consistently selling, and spot goods are flowing out steadily, which is noteworthy. The selling sentiment from the Northern brokers is quite strong. Numbers 14, 35, and Defu are all constantly selling. The trend is expected to continue hovering downwards. Yesterday's developments: the opening was firm due to buying by Tiansheng, Tongkang, and other firms, followed by fatigue due to selling by the Northern brokers. Although Zhenkang, Maotai, Hongda, and number 42 had some demand in the middle, number 38, Zhifeng, Xieda, and Runli continued to sell. Type A closed slightly lower at 1.1 yuan. In the afternoon, number 20 had buying, still struggling to push up prices. Numbers 5, 38, 41, and Tongsheng all had selling. Retail investors also had more buying than selling. Market prices rebounded by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The final result of market prices was slightly better by 0.1-0.2 yuan, except for Type A, which was slightly lower by 0.05 yuan. The total trading volume was estimated at about 700,000-800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 6.675 yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The short-term public bonds for dredging the Hai River in Hebei Province, guaranteed by the 8% surtax on the customs duties collected by the Tianjin Customs, were issued in April of the 14th year of the Republic of China, totaling 4 million yuan, with a term of 10 years and a monthly interest rate of 8%. Principal and interest were repaid once every year on April 20 and October 20. April 20 of this year is the date for full repayment. The total of 200,000 yuan of principal and 9,600 yuan of interest, totaling 209,600 yuan of legal tender, has been paid on schedule by the Pingjin Central and Jiaotong Banks.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Industry Association reported: The market is sluggish, but the underlying potential is good. Sellers are holding back, and people are paying close attention to various reports regarding Japan's attitude. In this time of European conflict, the obstacles to market progress can be eliminated. Jardine Matheson shares closed with a buying price of 20.01 yuan and a selling price of 20.03 yuan. Trading volume was minimal. Other stocks are also in the same situation. Prices of raw rubber in London and New York have risen slightly, and there have been slight inquiries about local rubber stocks.</p>
<p>London British Far East Companies' stock market quotations on the 26th of this month (Wednesday): all stocks were neutral.

<h3>Sugar Market: Manufacturers Repurchase Short-Term Futures, Dutch Sugar Rises Again, Local Refined White Sugar Follows Suit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dutch raw white sugar's price rose strongly because producers in the region, through Jardine Matheson in Shanghai, repurchased 7,300 bags of June raw white sugar at a price of about 9.10 Dutch guilders. Therefore, sentiment was even more bullish. In the guild's trading, 24 raw white sugar spot goods at the warehouse initially traded at 26.8 yuan, then called for 27 yuan. Transit goods rose 0.35 yuan, rising to 18.7 yuan. Jardine Matheson's "B" mark bagged sugar at the eastern warehouse traded at 26 yuan, with 100 bags traded. The western warehouse traded 300 bags at 26.35 yuan, OW mark at 26.15 yuan, CX mark at 26.05 yuan, DY mark at 25.9 yuan, HX mark at 25.75 yuan, H mark raw sugar at 17 yuan.</p>
<p>Dutch sugar production prices, according to reports, are 8.65 Dutch guilders for September, and 9.15 for July and August. Jardine Matheson's bagged white sugar for June has been sold out, and the July supply will not be available until next month, with a price of about 10.60 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>Local refined white sugar's price also rose along with the frequent increase in raw granulated sugar prices. Zhenji No. 1 was 26.7 yuan, No. 2 was 16.2 yuan, No. 3 was 25.7 yuan, No. 4 was 25.2 yuan, No. 1 factory crystal sugar was 32 yuan, and Jingming crystal sugar was 33.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Guotang Shantou refined white sugar opened for more than 400 bags, with Sanjian at 24.6-24.8 yuan, Sanyu refined raw at 15.4 yuan, the next grade at 15.2 yuan, and old raw granulated sugar opened at 12.8 to 11.7 yuan, totaling more than 100 bags. Yesterday, 3,230 bags of sugar were shipped from Shantou.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Fueling the Flames, the Surge in Cotton Yarn is Unstoppable; Customer Sales are Strong: Peers Rampantly Accumulate and Overstock; Trading is Active: Totaling 4,765 Bales</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the surge is very strong. Although the actual demand from Guangxi is less than before, Yunnan is also developing, and sentiment is unusually lively. Because the available supply of spot goods has been significantly depleted, general investors have a strong bullish outlook, so the momentum is even more robust. Trading among peers is very brisk. As for those who are cornering the market, they are buying even more aggressively due to the tense situation, adding more weight. The market then soared upwards. The 20-count Double Horse yarn is particularly hot, with new highs appearing one after another. However, Guangxi, which was the most active buyer the day before yesterday, has become less interested in buying because selling prices have been rising rapidly. However, the floating traders in the market, influenced by all kinds of rumors, are accumulating and overstocking even more rampantly and becoming even more excited. In the afternoon, buyers from Yunnan and other inland areas arrived in droves, the market tightened sharply, and the surge was very strong. The price of 20-count Special Jincheng has reached 420 yuan. Although trading in the market is active, a significant portion is factory sales.</p>
<p>Regarding the spot yarn situation, the market was calm at the opening this morning. Customers were not active, and the public expected a small correction, so the opening was down by 1.5 yuan, with the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn at 407.5 yuan. However, Hong Kong still had a small need, and prices rebounded. However, large-scale transactions were still lacking, so although it rose to 409 yuan in the middle, the warehouse price was 401.5 yuan. Before long, certain individuals suddenly started manipulation, and prices suddenly fell. A few brokers were calling out in the market, "Do you want Double Horse? Only selling for 401.5 yuan!" Unexpectedly, they fell into someone's trap. By the time of the close, the price surge started again. In an instant, the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 410.5 yuan, and the warehouse price was 403.7 yuan, a rise of over 2 yuan in an instant. In the afternoon, purchasing from Yunnan and other inland areas suddenly increased, and the market continued to advance. According to statistics, all buyers in the day totaled 4,765 bales. The prices of 20-count Tiannu Double Horse rose by 3-4 yuan, and other yarns rose by 2-3 yuan. The factories opened: Tongyi Factory opened 100 bales of 10-count Golden Rooster at a price of 325 yuan, 245 bales of 20-count Golden Rooster at a price of 402-403 yuan, Yong'an Factory opened 100 bales of 10-count Special Jincheng at a price of 348 yuan, Chongxin Factory opened 350 bales of 20-count Dafa at a price of 384 yuan, 360 bales of 10-count Dafa at a price of 322 yuan, Anda Factory opened 300 bales of 20-count Flying Tiger at a price of 412 yuan, from June to August. Today, 470 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, 5 pieces to Xiamen, 405 pieces to Shantou, and 530 pieces to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by each group are listed separately on the left:</p>
<p>Peers 1,505 Hong Kong 230</p>
<p>Inland 1,010 Yunnan 1,720</p>
<p>Sichuan 200 Tianjin 215</p>
<p>Shantou 205 Statistics totaling 4,765</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market remains firm as before, with the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn at 378 yuan, and 382 yuan for next month, still up about 2 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cloth Should Use Chinese Yarn: Chinese Factory Yarn is Like a Prisoner in Jail; Japanese Factory Yarn is Like a Tiger Released from Its Cage; Hoarding for Speculation Does Not Help National Production; The Resurgence of the Price Surge is Due to Many Factors</h3>
<p>The long-sluggish yarn market suddenly surged again in the past two days. The reason for this is that frequent good news has boosted morale, and the date of victory is getting closer and closer. As a result, the Japanese yen has plummeted, counterfeit currency has fallen sharply, and those in Tianjin who hold Japanese and counterfeit currency have turned to Shanghai to buy Japanese factory yarn and cloth in large quantities. As a result, Japanese yarn and cloth have risen quite sharply, and the demand for Chinese factory products has become more urgent. Now, let's explore the reasons for the price surge:</p>
<p>1.  The price difference between 10-count coarse yarn, 32-count single yarn, 42-count double-ply yarn, and 20-count yarn is becoming increasingly narrow. Some yarn factories see that coarse yarn has high profits and sells well, so they have slightly changed their spindles. All of the factory's futures have already been booked and bought up by the northern Tianjin group. At the same time, Ningbo Hefeng Factory specializes in spinning coarse yarn. Since the river blockade, the source has been cut off. Only yesterday did the Ende ship bring 1,200 bales, but it was still not enough.</p>
<p>2.  In the previous month, the amount of 4-count, 5-count, 6-count, and 8-count yarn spun by Chinese factories was very large. According to surveys, it was about 50,000-60,000 bales, with delivery dates now extending to May, June, July, August, and September. It is said that the factory's profit on this cotton yarn is higher than other yarns, but the yarn merchants' profits are even greater.</p>
<p>3.  Recently, Japanese yarn has been rising step by step, with a great upward trend. The reasons for this are: First, those who sold short in Qingdao's transactions suffered heavy losses, so they turned to Shanghai, regardless of everything, rampantly accumulating and overstocking. Second, with the decline of Japanese and counterfeit currency in North China, buyers are also buying Japanese yarn in large quantities in Shanghai. Therefore, in two or three weeks, it has jumped 30-40 yuan. The 20-count Blue Phoenix and Water Moon have seen new highs since the war. It is said that the Shanghai group has suffered huge losses this time, with few earning profits. The Tianjin and Qingdao groups have made a full profit and returned home.</p>
<p>4.  After the sharp rise in Japanese yarn, it has affected Chinese yarn. The yarn from Tianjin Beiyang and Hengyuan, two Chinese factories, has been squeezed out of the market by Japanese yarn and can only be transported south to find a way out. Unexpectedly, compared with Japanese yarn recently, this yarn is much cheaper (the selling price is all based on exchange rates), and it is even more cost-effective to remit. Therefore, the Tianjin group, with their quick wits, has collected 20-count Three Rings Eight Immortals 17-count Three Rings, etc., and loaded them back to their hometown. After their sweep, market prices have naturally tightened.</p>
<p>5.  Based on the above situation, the price of 20-count local yarn is the cheapest. General speculators focus on this. The wealthy are hoarding it. Therefore, in recent times, although the Oujiang area in eastern Zhejiang has been automatically blockaded, and shipping has been stopped, and Japanese warships have gathered in the southern Fujian and coastal areas, and there has been constant unrest, yarn and cloth have not been attacked, but have been able to stand in a stable situation, repeatedly advancing and retreating at the 400 yuan mark for a long time. In the past two days, there has been a sudden price surge again.</p>
<p>6.  The inland Guangxi group has not been buying for a long time, but recently the demand has risen slightly, and they are mainly buying 20-count Double Horse, followed by Tiannu Special Jincheng. Therefore, the long-accumulated 20-count yarn has now been supported by actual transactions, resulting in a sharp rise. General speculators are spreading rumors in the market, fueling the flames, making it even more intense. However, actual sales are strong, and spot goods are temporarily in short supply, so prices are naturally rising. However, the surge in prices is too strong, hindering the development of actual sales. As for the medium-quality 20-count yarn, that is, the products of newly established yarn factories, the prices are 10+ yuan cheaper, but sales are still sluggish. According to people in the industry, there is still a possibility that the price of 20-count yarn will rise in the future, because the price of Japanese yarn is high, and inland groups are changing to Chinese and British products to make a greater profit. The general public must look at 420 yuan. However, the price of 10-count coarse yarn has reached 350 yuan for medium-quality goods. Thinking in terms of comparison, it cannot be said to be cheap. However, other factories do not spin it, and there is demand from the north. However, after checking the amount purchased by the group and the amount opened by the peers, it is also quite a lot.</p>
<p>The reasons for the price increase are as such, but seeking the actual situation, I am afraid it is not permissible to be optimistic. It is said that Chinese yarn is stored in warehouses by general speculators and wealthy individuals, amounting to 80,000 bales, killing huge amounts of capital, igniting speculative price surges, expanding the sales of Japanese yarn, and increasing the cost of Chinese cloth. All of this is because hoarders only care about their own interests, making Chinese yarn seem like a prisoner in jail, and Japanese yarn like a tiger released from its cage. If this is not changed, the yarn of Chinese factories will never be able to compete with Japanese yarn, and weaving factories will only sell Japanese yarn. Then, how can the cloth they weave be called Chinese cloth? If Chinese merchants truly know the importance of the matter, they should make Chinese cloth factories use Chinese yarn, which is the greatest benefit, and not hoard for speculation.</p>
<h3>There is a Saying that U.S. Cotton Has Subsidies for Domestic Sales: Local Indian Cotton Deliveries Are Getting Busier; The Spot Price of Fire Machine Cotton Fell by 5 Jiao Yesterday</h3>
<p>The foreign cotton market: the New York cotton market was relatively quiet in the early morning. Later, due to the increasing number of people talking about U.S. cotton export subsidies, there was a rumor yesterday that the government, due to strong opposition to export subsidies, planned to first implement domestic cotton sales subsidies, and then export subsidies after success. This led to short covering, and banks and peers bought in droves. As a result, cotton prices rose sharply by 11 pound-sounds. Yesterday, India rose by 3 rupees, Egypt rose by more than 10 pound-sounds, and Liverpool spot prices rose sharply by 10 pound-sounds. Converting to legal tender, U.S. cotton rose by 1 yuan, Indian cotton rose by 1.2 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai: although yarn prices have been rising recently, factories have not been ordering in large quantities. Yesterday, because foreign cotton prices were too high, no transactions were heard from any factories. There have been many foreign cotton deliveries recently. The Belochistan cotton that each cotton firm ordered earlier has also arrived in Shanghai one after another, so if factories are short of goods, they can also purchase spot goods from the cotton firms at any time, which is still convenient. The following is a record of yesterday's cotton market price converted to factory delivery price:</p>
<p>Local cotton business remains scarce, and selling prices have fallen slightly. The price of Fire Machine cotton has fallen by 0.5 yuan, and factory demand is very sluggish. This is because the foreign cotton ordered by the factories has already been arriving in Shanghai, so the factories do not worry about running out of supplies. Therefore, transactions in local cotton are very quiet. However, the sources from all directions are still cut off, and the degree of decline is slow. The fundamental problems of the cotton market are not interesting. There are only 198 bales of Sutong cotton from northern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang cotton arrived in Shanghai on the Ende ship, bringing more than 6,300 pieces. Also, today's exports include 60 pieces of cotton shipped to Shantou. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Avoiding Losses from the Sharp Decline in "Counterfeit Currency," Tianjin Merchants in Shanghai are Changing to Hoard Cloth; Eastern Cloth Has Been Repeatedly Creating New Prices; Dyeing Factories Choose to Use National Cloth to Reduce Costs</h3>
<p>National Cloth: Cotton yarn is allowed, Eastern Cloth is up. The price surge is stronger, and sentiment is excited. Higher quality fine cloths, such as Da Peng, Fugui, Cannon, and Ming Yu brands, are cheaper in the current market than Eastern Xushe, and are suitable for dyeing blanks, so dyeing factories are eagerly adopting them. A certain bank transports and sells Da Peng, Fugui, and other brands of fine cloth to Kunming. Currently, because the required amount is insufficient, the factory's price has increased, so it is actively collecting from peers. The existing stock in the market is empty. The morning market selling price of each piece has risen by 0.05 yuan, and it has risen by 0.1 yuan again in the afternoon. Over 100 bales of fine cloth were traded, and buyers from northern Jiangsu and Guangdong and Fujian bought 100 bales. The factory price of fine twill has risen by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Dyeing factories have less demand, so although the selling price has increased, the actual transactions are still small. Only Guangdong buyers bought 50-60 bales of Ai Zi and other lower-grade brands. The market for Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth is also tight. Inexpensive handheld goods have gradually become scarce after being continuously collected by peers. The price of Dasheng Zhenzhong Factory's 16-pound goods has risen by 0.1 yuan, and the price of various Chinese factory 11-pound and 9-pound goods has risen by 0.05 yuan. Over 200 bales have been absorbed by local merchants and hoarders. The selling price of bleached and dyed cloth Xushe has also risen repeatedly due to the increased price of grey cloth. New transactions are difficult to negotiate. Southwest Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong buyers are actively transporting various colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, poplin, and striped bleached cloth, all of which are cheap. The local street's shipments are also mostly used to obtain fixed orders for grey cloth and finished products. The guerrilla zone has the strongest demand from the Bengbu gang, with colored cloth and colored twill being the most popular, with thousands of pieces being transported every day.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: White goods have continued to be actively purchased by northern buyers, and fine cloth and fine twill have repeatedly reached new highs. Yesterday, 12-pound Caiqiu fine cloth was sold for 14 yuan per piece for next month, and the spot price was 13.8 yuan. Other brands, such as Longtou, Yanghe, Shuangyu, Feiyu, Blue Rooster, and Laba, have all soared, creating new prices. Futures are higher than spot goods, with each piece increasing by 0.2-0.25 yuan. Tianjin buyers have been buying heavily, buying about 2,000 pieces of various fine cloth and fine twill. Qingdao buyers have also been buying about 1,000 pieces. Local street peers have also been dyeing nearly 1,000 pieces. Foreign firms have ordered 1,700-1,800 pieces of fine cloth for next month's futures. The shortage of fine twill has reached the point where there are no goods to sell. The prosperity of the market is truly rare. It is said that the counterfeit "Federal Reserve Certificate" in Tianjin has plummeted, and people are shaken. Tianjin merchants have too much floating capital, so they are all hoarding goods in Shanghai to prevent losses. Although purchases have been strong recently, the actual amount of goods shipped north is not seen much.</p>
<p>Exports: Today's (28th) exports of piece goods include 114 pieces shipped to Qingdao, 165 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 25 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 55 pieces shipped to Shantou, and 360 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Grains and Food - Native Flour Sales Not Stagnant, Selling Prices Consistently Firm</h3>
<p>Factory Flour: Yesterday, spot transactions at domestic factories were still active. Although there were fewer bulk transactions from merchant guilds after days of activity, retail sales were not weak. This was because North China merchant guilds were hesitant to purchase in large quantities due to the significant fluctuations in Tianjin exchange rates. However, their appetite for lower-grade flour was particularly strong. Retail sales by Southeast Asian merchant guilds were also brisk. A total of 50,000 to 60,000 bags were transacted in the market, with the selling price of some No. 3 and No. 4 flour being firm, mainly due to the current low inventory levels at various factories. The standard price for No. 2 flour remained at 4.45 yuan per bag for local merchants. Prices for lower-grade mixed brands varied slightly, and the market was brewing. According to investigations, 8,000 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin today, along with 5,800 bags to Xiamen, 22,000 bags to Shantou, and 500 bags of bran to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: The market was stable yesterday. New arrivals were temporarily scarce, and the amount of goods circulating in the market remained low. Transactions by local merchants were brisk, so mid-range brands maintained a price of 4.45 yuan with exchange included, diverging from the prices of domestic flour factories.</p>
<p>Wheat: Transactions remained slow yesterday. Flour factories have already received a new shipment of wheat. Their need for local wheat is not as strong. It is reported that recently arrived wheat from Beijing and Zhenjiang is mostly sent directly to factories or distributed to certain parties. The price is around 6.80 yuan, but the asking price in the market is still around 7 yuan. Although there are no open transactions in the regular market, the informal market is trending towards loosening.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes - Raw Soybean Oil Trading Only for Speculation Yesterday, Arrivals Continuous, Prices Declining</h3>
<p>Yesterday, raw soybean oil initially continued the momentum from the previous day, with rumors circulating that Japan needed foreign exchange. Therefore, the market sentiment felt quite firm. However, as the day progressed, due to the continuous arrivals and weak actual sales, the market only saw speculative trading. As a result, manipulation tactics failed to materialize, and prices declined across the board. The initial transaction involved 50 pieces of newly arrived Jiaozhou raw oil at 38.20 yuan, followed by 200 pieces of spot transactions at 39.30 yuan. Forty pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were sold at 33.50 yuan. Two hundred barrels of Dalian spot soybean oil fell from 47.50 yuan to 46.50 yuan. One hundred pieces of Dalian large baskets were traded at 44.50 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 27th, 379 bags of soybeans were exported to Hong Kong and 230 bags to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports - Ende Vessel Carries Wheat to the South, Loads Cotton Yarn and Yellow Wine</h3>
<p>Since Zhenhai, Japan, banned ships from entering and exiting on the 5th of this month, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has been interrupted, causing freight transport to halt. It is now known that the former Sino-Italian company's Ende vessel, chartered by the German merchant Taifeng Flour Mill, loaded 16,500 bags of foreign wheat in Shanghai to transport to Ningbo. With the approval of military authorities, it sailed to Ningbo on the 18th. After unloading, it returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. The vessel was allowed by military authorities in Ningbo to load over 21,300 pieces of cargo, including 6,070+ pieces of cotton, 275 pieces of wooden looms, 1,200 pieces of cotton yarn, 4,620 pieces of fresh eggs, 3,030 pieces of yellow wine, and over 5,100 pieces of local paper. The rest were miscellaneous goods such as straw hats and straw mats, as well as 125 pieces of silk.</p>
<p>Additionally, 1,066 tons of tobacco leaves arrived from New York yesterday. Today (the 28th), 230 pieces of local paper will be shipped to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Letter - Oil Mill Association Statement Regarding the Origin of Raw Materials for Dayouyu Oil Cakes</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shenbao:</p>
<p>Regarding the question of the origin of soybean cakes mentioned in the commercial news section of your esteemed newspaper Xichang today, which involves whether the raw materials produced by the Dayouyu factory are domestic, we hereby clarify that this factory is a member of our association. Since the "August 13th" incident, all the soybeans used in the production of soybean cakes have been purchased from areas in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and Tongchonghai. The brokers involved include Yongfengchang, Yixiangfeng, Xinhe, Tairun, Shenyuanlai, and Yongshengchang, all of whom have documented records. The factory's raw materials have been limited to domestic products recently, resulting in daily production figures that are only one-tenth or one-twentieth of pre-war levels. If we were to follow what your esteemed newspaper published today, the intention would be ambiguous and could confuse the public. Therefore, we provide a detailed and truthful account in the hope that this letter will be published to correct any misinformation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Traditional Chinese Medicine and Diet Therapy</p>
<h3>Intestine-Moistening Foods</h3>
<p>— Cao Xiwang</p>
<p>Constipation is a condition of utmost importance and significance concerning human health. Patients often experience mental discomfort and are at risk of developing other illnesses. The treatment should first differentiate between mild and severe cases. For severe cases, treatments like peach kernel oil or hemp seed oil are used. However, the former is too potent and can harm vital energy, while the latter, although mild, contains too much oil, which can impede stomach function. Therefore, the above-mentioned remedies are not suitable for those with weak bodies, deficient stomachs, habitual constipation, or those with opium addiction-induced intestinal dryness. Only honey and trichosanthes root powder are peaceful in nature and have significant intestine-moistening effects. These are described as follows.</p>
<p>Honey: Its taste is sweet, harmonious, and non-toxic. Its functions include invigorating energy, tonifying the middle, nourishing the spleen and stomach, harmonizing nutrients, and moisturizing the internal organs. The ancient method of honey-based suppositories (this is extremely effective) is made by refining honey. Its intestine-moistening effect is self-evident. However, the above methods are all for external use. If changed to internal consumption, they are quite suitable for the elderly, those with weak bodies, and those with chronic diseases like habitual constipation. Furthermore, its sweet and fragrant taste is palatable and does not harm vital energy or damage the stomach. However, pure products are rare on the market, so be careful when purchasing. (Dosage) Three times a day, one spoonful each time, taken with warm water one to two hours after meals, or mixed with other foods.</p>
<p>Trichosanthes Root Powder (Gua Lou Gen): It is a root and stem-type plant, similar in shape to potatoes and yams. It tastes sweet, balanced, slightly sour, and has a slightly bitter, slightly cold nature. There are many records of its effects in medical books. However, its main functions are to generate fluids, quench thirst, moisturize dryness, nourish the stomach, and moisten the intestines for bowel movement, which is no less effective than honey. The most famous producing area of this product is Jiading, so the best ones are called Jiading Trichosanthes Root Powder. The products are divided into medicinal and edible types. For medicinal purposes, it is taken out of the mud, washed, peeled, and sliced before being used in medicine. For edible purposes, after washing and peeling, it must be immediately put into a mortar, mashed into juice, strained to remove the residue, and allowed to settle. After the juice has settled, it is dried in the sun and ground into a fine powder before it can be consumed. Regular consumption of this trichosanthes root powder is quite effective for those with weak bodies, weak stomachs, and chronic constipation. If you want to try it, you can inquire at a Southern Goods store. The method of consumption is the same as lotus root flour.</p>
<h3>Diet Therapy for Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Zou Demin</p>
<p>Leukorrhea is almost a common disease among women. The pathological principles are mostly damp-heat pouring downward, and qi deficiency causing prolapse; or due to excessive sexual activity, the uterus contains sticky substances such as yellow pus, fish brains, or blood, flowing out from the reproductive organs. Those with excessive turbid heat are foul-smelling. Over time, they become haggard, suffer from lower back pain, weakened brainpower, memory loss, and even affect menstruation, hindering fertility, and entering a premature state of aging. It is truly the most protracted and evil disease in the female world.</p>
<p>The quality and quantity of leukorrhea also vary. A small amount is harmless to health, but a large amount is a sign of disease. The treatment of this disease by both Western and Chinese medicine can only reduce it, but there is no thorough solution. Although treatment relies on medicine, it is even more important to be self-aware, avoid overthinking, and moderate sexual activity. Now there is a long-term diet therapy method that can be told to patients: Use one tael each of Gorgon fruit and Coix seed, five qian of Rehmannia glutinosa, and ten red dates, stewed and eaten daily, as a snack. It is economical and convenient. Regular consumption for several months will definitely be effective. Gorgon fruit and Coix seed have the function of consolidating and are also products that seep out moisture. Rehmannia glutinosa and red dates are things that nourish blood and strengthen the spleen, so eating them is especially beneficial to the sick body.</p>
<h3>Manifestation, Color, and Normal Characteristics of Rubella - Favorable and Adverse Conditions and Dietary Dos and Don'ts</h3>
<p>— You Xuezhu</p>
<p>Normal rubella can naturally manifest and, with the help of medication, the rash is easier to develop. After a fever, it can develop externally in three or four days. It first appears in front of and behind the ears, on the forehead, around the mouth, etc., and then gradually spreads down the body. The position of this rash on the skin is always consistent with the pores, that is, round nodules first appear on the pores, and then a red halo gradually develops from the solid nodules. This red halo is always slightly raised above the surrounding skin, so when touched with the hand, the skin in the rash area can be felt to be less smooth than healthy skin. The small nodules and the red halo together form a circular rubella rash, about the size of a hemp seed, hence the name measles.</p>
<p>Our pores are countless, but the development of rubella does not cause all pores to develop rashes. It has been heard that if a part of the pores are all covered with rashes, they must be densely packed together, creating an abnormal shape. Since the pores of Wu people are very close, the rashes are connected together and form spots and patches. If the small rash has a normal color, it is not a major problem. If it is flat or has mottled textures, as if the whole body is covered with red clouds, the internal heat is already very high, and there may be convulsions. The treatment focuses on clearing and resolving. Gypsum, scrophularia, forsythia, trichosanthes root, anemarrhena, ophiopogon, scutellaria, and pueraria can all be used as appropriate. Therefore, drinks should also be cooling. Reed root, red sugarcane, orange juice, honeysuckle dew, and artemisia annua dew can all be taken. The heat of this syndrome is related to the accumulation in the stomach and intestines, so food should be prohibited, otherwise it will be like adding oil to a fire, or adding fuel to a boiling pot, and the momentum will increase. There is also a type of rubella rash that looks like blisters, and the symptoms are chest tightness, vomiting of clear water, and warm body. This is due to blood circulation disorders or dietary indiscretions. Improper handling, chest fullness, abdominal distension, and tight blood vessels will cause the water in the blood to often penetrate the blood vessels and seep into the rubella rash, becoming blister-like. Because of its high heat, the focus is also on clearing heat, and add Spikemoss, Saposhnikovia, and Mustard Flower; if due to dietary indiscretions, then focus on digestion, Gallus gallus domesticus, Radish Seed, Charred Hawthorn, Tangerine Peel, and Hordeum germinatum are necessary.</p>
<p>Rubella and smallpox have different causes and different diagnoses. Even in terms of color, the diagnostic methods are very different. In general, smallpox is afraid of bright red, the skin is tender and easily broken, and it must cause itching; rubella rash is most fond of being red, the redder the color, the more completely the toxin is released, which is a positive sign. If the spirit is weak and the color of the rash is pale and not bright red, it is a sign of insufficient heart blood. If treatment is not sought early, it will become convulsive in acute cases, and develop into consumption in chronic cases. The treatment is based on Angelica sinensis, Rehmannia glutinosa, Carthamus tinctorius, and aged tangerine peel to benefit and activate blood. In terms of diet therapy, red beans with ginger, decocted and taken as a soup, can still be appropriate, but only the soup can be sipped, and the red beans and heavy sediment should be discarded. If the color is too red, accompanied by constipation and dry lips and mouth, this is a sign of internal flaming fire and extreme heat. At this time, the stomach's acceptance is not open, and there is no need to explore fifteen food matters. Cooling drinks, taking more of them is also harmless. If not treated early, internal heat will be extreme and cause bleeding. The rubella rash will turn from purple to black, and it will be difficult to save. In terms of beverages, orange juice should be taken more, mung bean peel decoction and cold drinks, or honeysuckle dew can also be taken; however, a cup of water can't extinguish a burning cart of firewood, it is really not enough to stop the raging flames. A large dose of Rhinoceros horn and Rehmannia decoction may offer a chance of salvation.</p>
<h3>Stomach Qi Disease</h3>
<p>— Gu Zongwen</p>
<p>Stomach Qi pain is a disease that can be caused by anger or excessive smoking and drinking, leading to dysfunction of the spleen and stomach. Symptoms include fullness and pain in the epigastrium and abdomen, belching, nausea, acid regurgitation, inability to eat, and increased pain upon eating. This is what Western medicine calls "hyperacidity." Recently, patients suffering from stomach Qi disease often take sodium bicarbonate. It can indeed relieve pain after taking it, but it soon recurs. Sodium bicarbonate contains an alkaline effect. After taking it, it neutralizes the excessive stomach acid, so it can immediately stop the pain. However, after a few days, the stomach acid increases again, and the pain recurs. To seek thorough treatment, one must first use medication to calm the liver and regulate Qi, so that the liver and stomach are harmonized, and the disease will naturally recover. However, patients must also be self-aware and pay attention to self-care and diet therapy, so that it will never recur.</p>
<p>Prohibiting all miscellaneous foods is the first thing that patients with stomach Qi pain must pay attention to. Even the proper daily food intake should be reduced. At most, eat two small bowls each time. The food can be completely digested and obtain all its nutrients. Do not overeat arbitrarily, and damage the spleen and stomach again. Since the stomach is weak, it naturally cannot digest hard foods, so it is advisable to eat porridge. If there is burnt rice porridge, it is even better, because its taste is more fragrant and can open the appetite, and it is also easier to digest after being stir-fried, but this porridge should not be too thin, because it contains too much water and easily causes stomach acid to rise. As for the vegetables eaten on weekdays, bean and tofu skin are generally better, always taking alkaline foods. All irritating and spicy, raw, and cold foods must be absolutely prohibited. On weekdays, you can use Buddha's hand or Citrus aurantium to make tea, to relieve chest and abdomen discomfort. After several months or half a year, the spleen and stomach gradually recover, and the appetite also increases. Then you can eat rice and slightly loosen the restrictions, but you should not be too angry or worried, so as not to destroy all previous efforts.</p>
<p>Eat less and taste more, eat more and hurt your belly: choose to eat to nourish your body, eat indiscriminately and hurt your health.</p>
<h3>Decoction of Medicine</h3>
<p>— Zhang Luo</p>
<p>Patients often neglect the matter of decocting medicine, but if it is not decocted properly, the efficacy of the medicine will easily disappear, and it is necessary to provide guidance to servants who decoct the medicine.</p>
<p>In general, for those with internal injuries, the medicine should be decocted with a low flame for a long time, because it contains more products that nourish vital energy. If decocted for a short time, the efficacy of the medicine cannot be exerted. For those with external infections, it should be decocted with a high flame to a boil, and it should not be decocted for a long time, because its medicine is mostly aromatic and penetrating, and it will lose its efficacy if it is left for a long time. If the prescription contains pills, powders, or loquat leaves, Inula flower, etc., they should all be wrapped and decocted to prevent the decoction from becoming too turbid and difficult to swallow, and to prevent micro-hairs from choking into the throat. Salts such as Mirabilitum and Sodium Sulfate should be boiled and filtered, and impurities should be removed. Antelope horn and agarwood powder should not be added to other medicines for decoction, but should be taken by infusion. American ginseng and ginseng should be decocted and infused separately to avoid the loss of medicinal juice. Other medicines such as those that require "boiling first" and "adding later" should also be noted: such as keel and oyster shells, which are solid in texture, their medicinal flavor is not easy to decoct out, and should be boiled first and then added to other medicines for decoction; and fragrant medicines such as mint, amomum, cardamom, agastache, and eupatorium should be added later, and remove from heat as soon as it boils. The author believes that doctors must provide detailed notes when prescribing prescriptions, and patients must follow them, so that efforts will be multiplied with half the effort.</p>
<h3>Table Salt</h3>
<p>— Ding Shicheng</p>
<p>Table salt is one of the necessities for mankind. In addition to flavoring and curing, it can also be used to treat various pain illnesses. For example, for those suffering from heel pain, joint pain, neuralgia, etc., one or two pounds of table salt can be soaked in a large pot of boiling water. After the water is warm and suitable, immerse the painful part in it while it is still hot, until the water is cold. Do this every day. In two to three months, the illness will heal itself. If the pain is in the stomach or other parts that cannot be immersed in water, the salt can be stir-fried until hot, tied tightly with white cloth, and then slowly rubbed over the painful area. Re-stir-fry until cold (one person stir-fries, one person rubs), and iron it. On one trip, there was snow on the road. After walking for several miles, I finally met a boat. I had not changed my wet shoes and socks all night. Within a few months, I suffered from knee pain, which was soft and weak, making it difficult to walk, and the pain was endless. I took medicine for several months, but it was not eradicated. It often ached on holidays and cloudy days. A classmate, Mr. Mou, taught me a method: use two metal buckets, about five inches in diameter, one or two inches higher than the knee, pour hot salt water into them, and soak for one or two hours every night, without interruption. I felt that my whole body was steaming, sweating profusely, which was very comfortable, and I slept well. In less than two months, I recovered and have not relapsed in four years. Its efficacy is truly unbelievable.</p>
<h3>Maltose</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruwei</p>
<p>Maltose (i.e., malt extract) is sweet, warm, and tonifies the middle. It has a sticky, cohesive, and lubricating nature. Maltose boiled with glutinous rice is of good quality. It is excellent for those with weak middle qi, abdominal pain and disharmony, sallow complexion, emaciation, loose stools, and hoarse cough. China has used it since ancient times. Zhang Zhongjing's Xiao Jian Zhong Tang (Minor Construct the Middle Decoction) uses this as the main ingredient. Because the original prescription was Guizhi Jia Shaoyao Tang (Cinnamon Twig Decoction plus Peony), the addition of maltose changed its name to Jian Zhong (Construct the Middle). If maltose is removed and Astragalus is added, it is called Huangqi Jian Zhong Tang (Astragalus Decoction to Construct the Middle). It can be seen that maltose is the main medicine for Jian Zhong, not a supporting ingredient. Because it benefits Qi and nourishes blood, it has the clever effect of benefiting the middle and maintaining transformation. Qianjin Su Mi Gao (Thousand Gold Crispy Honey Paste) also uses maltose as the main ingredient, mainly to treat aphonia caused by Qi depletion. Today, maltose is difficult to purchase in Shanghai. It is advisable to inquire and purchase it.</p>
<h3>Talking About Milk Consumption</h3>
<p>— Ding Jimin</p>
<p>Chinese people have not eaten this milk for thousands of years. Once they start eating this sweet, greasy, and fishy (some say fragrant) milk for the first time, it is inevitable that some people will react, even with constipation, stomach discomfort, bad breath, and diarrhea. Therefore, in my observation, the nature of milk is the same as that of Sun Simiao, neutral, without any hot or cold properties. What matters is whether the Chinese stomach is accustomed to it. Therefore, those who perceive it as hot will perceive it as hot, and those who perceive it as cold will perceive it as cold, which is each person's reaction.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of the nature of milk being cold or hot, and its nutritional value, a conclusion can be drawn here: those who are used to it can eat it as much as possible, and those who are not used to it may as well not eat it. Next, I will talk about the nutritional value of milk for patients.</p>
<p>In ancient times, we also had many prescriptions using milk to treat diseases, one of which is called Jiucai Zhi Niuruyin (Chive Juice Milk Drink). It is specially used to treat dysphagia and vomiting. Another one is called Wuzhiyin (Five Juice Drink), which uses six parts of milk and one part each of chives, lotus root, and pear juice, and has the same effect. Dysphagia and vomiting are mostly caused by eating raw things and dry food that cannot be swallowed and will naturally be vomited out. The above two prescriptions can nourish, moisturize, and provide waiting treatment. This is also very reasonable in light of modern nutrition science.</p>
<p>Many people who are weak and suffering from chronic diseases can eat milk; except for those who are not used to it (maybe they can get used to it if they eat it).</p>
<p>Ordinary people. Eating milk every day can indeed, as Sun Simiao said, replenish blood vessels, benefit the heart, and build muscle. The body is healthy, strong, and moisturized, the complexion is bright, and the spirit is not diminished. However, it must meet the conditions he said: "do not limit it for one day, and should allow it to be sufficient and abundant." (The End)</p>
