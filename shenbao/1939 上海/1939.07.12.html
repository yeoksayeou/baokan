<h3 id="c10">但澤與歐局 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>有吳卓愚君投書本報，「從但澤問題推論歐洲局勢」。本報關於但澤與歐局，屢屢申論，皆就其演變之每一階段，陳述觀感；而吳君則從頭說起，綜述其歷史地理之前因後果；凡此資料，原屬公開之現實，初非嶄新之發見；顧爲本報所未嘗叙述也。爰節錄吳文於决，深信讀者諸君必能有得於斯文。記者識</p>
<p>現在歐洲風雲之緊張，關鍵繫於德意志與波蘭之但澤自由市爭執。德波爭執之關鍵，繫於「但澤巿」。原但澤巿是波蘭國「維斯杜拉河」之出海港口，面積僅七百五十四方哩，人口共三十八萬，多日耳曼人。歐洲大戰後，由國際聯盟委其管理於波蘭。但澤自由市之於波蘭，乃波羅的海之唯一大商港，而爲德國歷年所不忘情之一大問題。希特勒上臺後，曾與波蘭訂十年互不侵犯協定，近始廢止。在波蘭方面除獲得但澤巿經營商業之外，並從德國西部與東普魯士之間，形成走廊，爲出海要道，但波蘭亦自知但澤自由市之早晚必生問題，故於但澤市之北面，再闢一特尼亞商港，以圖擴充波蘭之對外貿易，使位處中歐之大陸國波蘭，保持出海之要道。德意志固野心勃勃，况但澤乃其故土。波蘭深知德意志之野心所在，故亦終年戒備，未敢或懈；誠以但澤市一旦變色，則波蘭走廊等於虛設，其對外貿易將瀕於絕境。故爲整頓工商，努力建設，活躍國內經濟起見，波蘭之必保持但澤巿與走廊，固亦波蘭立國之命運所關；而決無絲毫退讓餘地者也。縱使因此爆發戰爭，而有所犧牲，亦屬義無反顧。此爲波蘭秣馬厲兵，枕戈待旦以爭但澤命運之所由來也。</p>
<p>至於英法，對於波蘭之存亡，咸有極大之關繫，此爲一般人所能瞭解。誠以英國自希特勒氣炤在張，以至攫奧吞捷之後，感到不列顚威嚴之將受絕大威脅，是屬無可諱言。波蘭處於歐洲之中部，欲使歐局永久和平，唯有保障波蘭之始終獨立。蓋波蘭南隣德境，不啻爲阻德國勢力向東北發展之屏障；而波蘭東北昆連蘇聯，又不啻爲西歐諸邦築一長城；以故英法欲維持其固有之莊嚴威望，實以保障波蘭爲先。故張伯倫氏對波德爭持時之一切言論，皆極堅定。至於法國，法波之間，更見唇齒相關，此爲兩國所共認；以故於一九二一年二月，法波兩國成立同盟條的。因此之故，英法波三國；行動一致，以及波蘭一旦有事時，英法之決不坐視，自在意中矣。</p>
<p>希特勒式之侵略，政治與軍事並進，證諸攫取奧捷兩國，已能說明其手腕。波蘭自復國以後，鑒於自身之阽危，故歷年對於外交，備極活躍，其允顯著者，例如爲防德國自南侵犯，乃與羅馬尼亞簽訂同盟條的；更因國內烏克蘭族問題，與蘇聯在一九二一年三月十日簽訂蘇波條的；一九三二年，更與蘇簽訂互不侵犯之條的；一九三三年，波蘭爲固定國際地位，使他國無從活動起見，於是與蘇聯，阿富汗，愛沙尼亞，拉特維亞，波斯（現改爲伊朗）羅馬尼亞，土耳其諸國，簽訂反侵略之定義條的。一方面努力於國內建設，整軍經武，同時爲防備德國之藉端起釁起見，由貝克外長與德國談判邦交問題，終於一九三四年一月二十六日，成立德波互不侵犯條的，其有效期間爲十年。凡此種種，爲波蘭二十年來提心吊膽，『謹防賊盜』之一貫政策。洎乎今日，波蘭已有陸軍一百萬人，後備軍人達二百萬之多，而全國人口亦由二千七百十八萬而達三千五百萬。在彼國內，無論農工商各業，均在改進發展之中。蓋波蘭對於未來之歐洲大戰，早已肯定爲早晚必有爆發之一日；而亡國之慘，固允波蘭所久已領略者也。</p>

<h3 id="c50">新匯劃流通市面　整個金融已安定　銀行提存風潮已經平息　籌碼增加行莊恢復放款 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>滬巿金融、自財政部馬電、限制提存後、投機交易、均巳受限制而銳减、銀錢業推行新匯劃、調整舊匯劃、增加市面籌碼流通、故當些二十八年度開始之時、整個金融、已趨安定、茲分誌各情如决、</p>
<p>限制提存風潮平息</p>
<p>財部馬電到滬後、銀錢業一致遵照實行、限制提存、不明眞相之存戶及投機份子、紛紛向各銀行提取存款、故華商銀行提存風潮、繼續發生、雖每戶每週限制爲五百元、但積少成多、爲數已屬可觀、自銀錢業各行莊半年決算休假開市後、巿塲人心漸趨安定、各行逐日支付、已能扯平、且有一部份行莊存款、較付款爲多、故提存風潮、已告平息、</p>
<p>失面流通籌碼增加</p>
<p>銀錢業推行之新滙劃制度、自本月四日起、由各行莊向銀行聯合準備委員會開始領用以來、已在市面流通、總額雖暫定爲五千萬元、但尙未領用足額、頭寸頗爲豐富、同時各行莊存款、在銀錢兩業準備會庫之舊滙劃二千二百萬元、亦巳由銀行聯合準備會改爲法鞘往來戶、於四月起、由各行莊領用法幣、應付存戶提款、巿塲籌碼、經此調劑、活潑不少、</p>
<p>現鈔收縮投機减少</p>
<p>財部爲防止資金外流、安定滬巿金融起見、特規定存款支付辦法、實行限制提存、收縮市面現鈔、杜絕吸收法幣、轉購外匯等投機、實施以來、頗收成效、蓋外匯·現金·棉紗·豆米·等巿塲、均因現鈔缺乏、匯劃貼現飛漲、投機者已不能如前之爲所欲爲、雖未能全部杜絕投機活動、但交易已告銳减、</p>
<p>整個金融已趨穩定</p>
<p>自外匯變動、繼以財部限制提存後、滬市金融突轉緊縮、往來信用停滯、旋經銀錢業議決安定市面辦法、調整匯劃票據、推行新匯劃制度、增加流通籌碼、調劑同業資金、輔助工商各業、實行以來、爲時雖暫、但整個金融、已趨穩定、各行莊對於工商各業抵押信用各種放款、亦已恢復、在可能範圍內、接受辦理、</p>
<p>票據交換改定時間</p>
<p>銀錢兩業七月四日起、集中票據交換之後、因銀行收錢莊之票據時間太遲、致事務上發生種種困難、錢業領袖裴雲卿、曾提出改善辦法、建議公會、新聲社記者咋向銀錢業探悉、業經銀行聯合準備委員會與錢業聯合準備庫商妥、昨已通告、准十二日起實行、茲錄通告如下、「逕啟者、本庫自以委託方式加入票據交換以來、因銀行收錢莊之票據、時間太遲、致事務上發生種種困難、茲已商請銀聯會之同意、自本月十二日起、票據交換時間、提前半小時（三時）舉行、嗣後各莊所有銀行票據、亦請提前半小時（二時）交付本庫、二時以後、請逕付銀聯會、該會收票時間、以二時半爲限、相應函達、至希洽照辦理爲荷」、</p>

<h3 id="c65">記錢業元老　秦潤卿先生（下） <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>秦先生首先叙述上海錢業盛衰的簡史，他說：在太平軍興以前，上海錢業最發達的地點，是在南市，因爲那時外埠的船隻，都是帆船，停泊在十六舖一帶，所以商賈都薈集在這個地方。後來太平軍進入東南，那時上海地方也是成爲游資集中之區，到光緒中葉，上海錢莊設在南市的四十家，設在北市的五十家，但營業範圍，也很有限，每家全年的收付，不及百萬銀兩；因爲當時利息較厚，開支較省，所以多數都有盈餘。就拿當時薪給來講，錢莊經理每年不過二三百元，普通職員每年十元或數十元，嗣經甲午庚子兩决軍事，錢菜乃呈中落之象。宣統初年，受橡皮風潮的影響，繼之以鼎革之役，上海甫北市錢莊在數量上就减少了一半。民國以來，在十一二年的時候，爲錢業最發達的時期。十六年以後，銀行遂漸增加，錢業因經幾决變故，發展較難，民國二十四年政府實施白銀政策，錢業因受地產抵押的關係，愈覺較前减色，到現在錢業本身都能確保信用，鞏固業務，這是値得欣慰的。</p>
<p>秦先生繼續談到錢業的前途，他確信錢業是決不會失敗，理由是錢業已有百餘年的歷史，是夙以信用放款爲主要業務，凡是各業資金不敷周轉，大都賴錢業調劑。百餘年來工商百業之以少許資本，成就偉大規模者，所在皆是，或者不幸營業失敗，錢業是抱定苟可爲力，無不儘量抉助，因以起衰振微，重復舊觀者，也常有所見。中國的經濟組織，幼稚落後，無庸爲諱，凡百行業，全賴信用貸款，以資挹注，故錢業所經營的業務，就中國工商經濟狀况而言，前途仍極有望。</p>
<p>憑着他經營錢業成功的歷史與經騐，他相信，錢莊如果專心在業務上努力，斷不會遭受挫折，其所以挫折的原因，都是因私人情感的關係，或者放賬太濫，或者個人兼營其他事業，因爲受了不可預料的影響，以致使錢莊連帶受累。就是職員個人，如果專心於本業，處處從本業利害上着想，是决不會有出乎意外的挫折發生。他的結論，是不圖私利，不會失敗，個人如此，事業如此，這眞是經騐之談，不可磨滅的。</p>

<h3 id="c66">渣華新輪　芝楂連加參觀記 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 文星</p>
<p>凡是稍爲注意歐洲班和美洲班郵船的人，都知道有意郵·大英·北德·總統·昌興，等幾家郵船公司，因爲這幾家郵船。噸位很大，設備華麗，素有海上王宮的尊稱，這是無可諱言的。其實，和中國同胞關係最稱密切，乘客以中國人爲最多的，還應當首推渣華輪船公司。</p>
<p>渣華輪船公司的航綫，在南洋羣島一帶，它的第一航綫係由上海經厦門，香港，小呂宋，宿務，萬鴉佬，孟加錫，峇厘而達泗水，第二航綫是從上海出發，經厦門，香港，文島，吧城，井利汶，三寳瓏，而到泗水。</p>
<p>我們看見上面這些南洋羣島的地名，或許還有點生疏，但是我們不容忽視，這許多地方，都是華僑胼手胝足，慘淡求生的所在，要是提到今日燦爛的南洋，可以說是華僑建立的。渣華公司輪船的航綫，是終年航行着華僑寄跡之處。每年從厦門到南洋，或者由南洋回到厦門的僑胞，不知道有幾千萬人，都是乘渣華船的。</p>
<p>渣華的輪船，有芝尼加拿，芝沙丹尼，芝沙路亞，芝巴德，芝沙力等幾艘，噸位相常大，設備非常舒適，尤其是合於中國人的習慣，餐廳的佈置，好像上海的杏花樓，紅木的圓桌，長的睡椅，十足表現華南的風味，僑胞上了船，似乎到了家一樣。</p>
<p>現在渣華公司又有一條新船處女航來滬，船名芝楂運加M．S．Tjitjalengka，是嗬囒造船廠所造，總噸數一七一五〇噸，馬力六〇〇〇匹，每小時速率十五海哩，船身長四七四呎十吋，闊六四呎六吋。自艙面至艙底深三八呎六吋，吃水二八呎九吋，載貨噸數九九三〇噸。載客可一四二〇人，頭等艙六四人（每間各有浴室），二等艙五五人，三等艙一〇〇人，統艙一二〇〇人。這條新郵船，較「芝沙丹尼」號的式樣和設備，更爲進步完美。有運動塲，游泳池，無綫電台，圖書館，醫院，藥房，其他如交際室，吸烟室，理髮窒，酒排間。甲板上尙有以玻璃做成的雨天散步處，夜間燈光裝配的美善，與冷熱氣設備的適合，均是很難得的。各客艙，裝有無綫電播音機，隨時播送各種音樂興時事報告。橱房及食物儲藏室，亦有特殊設備，能使食物鮮美可口。</p>
<p>昨天薄暮，我們幾個人，應渣華公司的邀請，去參觀這條處女航來滬的新輪，小輪從新關碼頭出發，這「司各脫一號」的拖駁船上，擠滿了許多的參觀者，人數的衆多，眞出於我們意料之外；船一開動，江風徐來，大家很覺高興。大的經過了二十餘分鏡，大家便抵新的「芝沙連加」船旁了。</p>
<p>上了船，眼前就覺得一亮，眞像鬧新房似的，放在我們前面的，都是可喜悅的新」的陳飾；而大家也充滿了十分的欣慰情緒。我們從頭等艙到上甲板，到船首船尾看了個暢快：到六時之後，才搭着原拖輪返滬。</p>
<p>晚上，渣華公司又在新新酒樓設讌款待各界，由大班葛禮藹，華經理錢冲甫以及重要職員陳世德，朱壽彭等招待，中西來賓，大的有八百餘人，一片歡樂之聲，到夜深才散。</p>

<p>到多銷少供過於求</p>
<p>國米市價、日來因到貨漸暢、已由穩定而轉趨回跌、內河交通亦逐漸恢復、河下到貨增加、在松江一帶被阻米船、已經釋放、先後到滬、來源大增、十日由各地到貨、如河下到船八九艘、火車裝到十餘車、航輪運到五六千包、總計共達萬餘包以上、十一日到貨亦有七八千包、而銷路方面、則因（一）大氣炎熱不宜囤儲、（二）現鈔缺乏、（三）米行囤戶棧存各貨均向市上求脫、（四）到貨隨市脫售因此市塲銷路淸淡、供過於求、致米價回跌頗猛、一律回至限價以內、平均回小三五角不等、足證各米棧存貨、雖已減至三十九萬九千九百零二包、但各米店內棧存貨及市民購儲之貨頗多、足敷三個月之需、故各米號門市交易、已轉談、各界希望租界當局、在此時機、再將限價予以調整、減輕市民負擔、</p>
<p>洋米起運月底抵滬</p>
<p>上海雜糧商委託達孚洋行訂購之西貢洋米、總的六百噸、業已裝輪起運、約本月底抵達、聞西貢米分伐羅·哥昆·百塞·三種、此次訂購之米、爲哥昆米、產於哥昆地方、形圓質堅、品質較優、爲上等米、該項洋米、每包一石二斗半、價格的二十一元、且係免稅進口、但抵滬之後、因滬巿國米價格回跌、故恐難獲厚利、</p>

<p>歐美科學先進之國家，人民富裕，靑年求學之機會固甚多，然其窮苦之靑年，在困難環境中努力奮鬥者，爲數仍屬不少。就中在科學上有偉大成就者，其勤苦奮鬥之精神，皆足爲吾國靑年感發興趣之資·茲述一事，願吾國靑年，聞風而自勵焉。美國有一窮苦學生，其父係農夫，常爲人傭。此生幼時甚好學，在中等學校於萬般困難之下，幸得舉業。欲入大學，苦於經濟無着，其父以累年所積資金盡予之，不過七十五元。彼入最廉之大學，而學費書籍等項，盡耗其所有。乃入飯館工作，每日可得三餐。在人家地室寄宿，爲之照料爐火，鑱草澆花，得免宿費。在校中各敎室司洒掃，並在校外各商店郵局作短時間之服役，獲酬資以便零用。終日上課作工，無片刻之暇，而其功課成績，因勤勞努力，甚優越。至第四年級之時，敎授嘉其有志，擢爲助敎，遂得較豐之薪給，無須再作雜工。畢業後，仍留校服務，爲正式敎員，始得返里省親，計囊中所餘，盡奉共父，而其數適爲七十五元，鄉人傳爲佳話。此人後爲著名科學家，歷任各大學校長，各學會會長，對於提倡高深研究，與促進科學敎育之事業，貢獻甚大。在專門科學上著作等身，而於文，哲，敎育，歷史，社會等學，論述亦極宏富，為美國科學界領袖者幾四十餘年，嘗旅行歐洲，各國之大學研究所，及其他學術機關，請其講演者數百次。又主張世界和平，反對侵略戰爭，爲人類之信睦與幸福努力焉，誠可謂豪傑之士，爲吾國靑年所宜取法者。然美國之學校及社會，對於窮苦靑年，皆格外予以臂助，半工半讀，甚爲風行。吾國窮苦靑年，不少英俊可造之才，甚望國內之學校與社會注意此點，師人之所長也。（此人名David　Starr　Jordan）</p>

<p>大自然是殘酷的，動物界的歷史，簡直就是一部爭鬥的歷史。但是世界上祗有兩種動物最慣於自相殘殺。一種是人類，另一種是螞蟻。</p>
<p>眞是怪事！這兩種動物在形式上有如此不同，而彼此的社會生活與習慣却十分相像。螞蟻生活在政治修明的國度裏，飼養家畜，種植食物——大多是小菌——積貯糧食，建造居屋，牠們的建築比原始人類的建築要高明得多。</p>
<p>最奇怪的，螞蟻的戰爭，竟與人類的戰爭極相像。蟻軍的戰衛與戰峪，恐怕還要給我們的軍事家奉爲典型哩。</p>
<p>若從天賦的武器說，螞蟻實在要比人强得多。可憐的人類毫無防禦武器，一對拳頭在攻擊的價値上極爲有限。而螞蟻倒有一套堅甲，還有一付强有力的顎。但是這些祗是牠們的基本武器，還有看門家伙呢！</p>
<p>在人類戰爭裏所知最可怕的毒氣是芥氣。大自然也給與螞蟻一種很相似的武器。有幾種螞蟻能射出一種液體到很遠的地方。若打中了敵蟻，那可憐的遭難者就動彈不得，不久即死。就是較大的動物如蜘蛛和小鳥，若遭受這種毒液，也不能幸存。</p>
<p>好多種螞蟻並沒有這種可怕的武器，都專靠牠的顎來咬破敵人的頭顱，或者竟然把敵人撕成碎片。</p>
<p>螞蟻的敵人就是敵羣中的任何螞蟻，不問來者是吾同種，可是在本羣中決沒有蟻奸。牠們具有非常發逮的嗅覺。能辦別出誰是朋友，誰是敵人。一遇到外來的侵略者，抗戰立刻開始。牠們不會屈膝求饒，也不會中途講和。</p>
<p>假使雙方各有少數螞蟻相遇，那麽蟻數較小的隊伍，立刻成散兵綫，準備厮殺。若是在大軍相對，惡戰開始時，牠們就會運用眞正的戰略，陣勢排得很完密，一切計劃都是成竹在胸，一絲不亂。</p>
<p>戰爭的起因，不是領土的爭執，便是爲蟻口過剩而開拓疆土。有一個瑞典的科學家曾把一袋螞蟻傾倒在另一君螞蟻的邊境附近，便引起了一塲大戰。他描寫如下。</p>
<p>起初沒有什麽動靜，因為雙主都沒有知道敵人的所在。不久。有幾隻路過螞蟻偶然被侵略者捕獲，立刻處死，不使他們有發送警報的機會。於是侵略部隊立即向前推進。而對方自衛的健兒也就在茂密的草　裏佔了優勢的軍略據點，以待敵人之進攻。</p>
<p>戰事初起時，守軍因爲衆寡不敵，敗退回城。這位作壁上觀的科學家，目見後方的蟻軍眞是萬分驚惶，東竄西奔，紛亂極了。正當緊急關頭，好！大出意料的一枝援軍到了。</p>
<p>這大隊的援軍，事先埋伏在城裏。現在以迅雷不及掩耳的姿態，突進戰塲。經過了一小時又半的殊死戰之後，敵軍兇熖頓挫。最後却潰不成軍，四竄逃命。爲自衛而奮鬥的蟻兒們，終得最後勝利。</p>
<p>螞蟻和戰爭，大槪都是如此。但有幾種螞蟻喜歡採用奇襲，或者包抄敵人，却不直接進攻。另有一種游擊螞蟻，時常神出鬼沒，聲東擊西，擾亂敵人，可算是最高明的戰略了</p>
<p>例如非洲的西亞福蟻（Siafuauts）在行軍的時候，常成一個密集的縱隊，隊形有四十呎闊，數哩之長。若一進入敵國的境界，立刻分出一隊戰士，而主力則仍舊繼續前進。這隊戰士又立刻再度分開，一部把所要攻擊的城市的一切出口完全封鎖起來，另一部則向前直衝，於是虞鬥開始。</p>
<p>有時一隊一隊的戰士不斷地從大本營派遣，各依一個角度前進。他們總是從兩翼或大本營之後撥出，這樣可使前綫始終保持其力量，以防奇襲。</p>
<p>一到肉搏的時候，在世界上誰也不能像螞蟻那樣的堅忍勇敢，一口咬住了敵人之後，到死不肯放鬆。就是自己的頭已經斷了，牠的鐵顎還楚那麽死命地咬住。</p>
<p>一個懦怯不前的人，不如一個螞蟻，一個爲虎作倀的人，更要被螞蟻所睡葉。</p>

<h3 id="c85">虎威 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>虎爲猛獸，捕殺犬羊等動物以為食。動物之較弱小者多畏之。所最奇者，已死之虎，甚至肢體磔裂者，仍足以威嚇他動物。十數年前，厦門警察在山中射殺一虎。此虎係孟加拉灣種（Bengaltigerr），體較高而色蒼，與中國內地所產者不同。數人舁至城中，以便民衆觀覽。而街市之犬，見此虎屍，率拽尾而遯，顯露畏懼之狀。旋由廈門大學生物系諸人為之剝製，成一標本。當其腑臟各器字之擲棄地上，犬見之者亦首鼠而竄。最後將其骨骼盛於一筐，携往校中，途中之犬遇之，皆急行奔避。蓋嗅虎之氣味而生畏乎？動物本能之發達，實亦不可否認者矣。</p>
<h3 id="c86">虎肉 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>當虎之骨骼舁至厦大生物室也，上下兩顎骨之基部，附着肌肉兩巨塊，即所胃嚼肌（Massetermuscle）也。余命製標本者將其取下而臠切之，滿盛一大鍋，雜以香料，醬油等物煮炙焉，若紅燒牛肉者然。經一日夜之久，始形熟爛。因思人之一生，　虎肉者能有幾次，此乃罕有之機會也。於是邀校中同人共嘗之。有一嘗而去者，亦有徒來觀看而徘徊不敢一試者。余食數塊，覺其肌理甚粗，味似羊肉，又似牛肉，不可名狀。最後余以其羹澆飯，甫下咽即忽欲嘔，其味雖不惡，而有不可形容者。令人之胃不能接受，誠不亦知其何故也。</p>
<h3 id="c87">醉度計 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 茸人</p>
<p>英國近有人創造一種醉度計，能使法庭上的法官不但易於斷定被告是吾酒醉，並且如果確是酒醉，更能辨別他究竟醉到什麼程度。</p>
<p>先令被告將呼出的氣吹滿一個氣球，然後將氣通過曾由一種過錳酸鹽着色劑，處理過的一舔硫酸溶液。這種溶液的顏色本像「刺腎垤爾」花（Lavender）的顏色，如果通氣後變爲灰黃色，就表示被告呼出的氣中含有充分的酒精，足以斷定他是酒醉。</p>
<p>這種酸溶液的顏色只有酒精足以使之起變化。酒醉程度的高下，只需視使溶液變色所需用的氣體數量。</p>
<p>無需和醉漢辯論。如果他吹入球中的氣能使溶液變色，必醉無疑。</p>
<h3 id="c88">最新冰凍療法 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— （顧不問）</p>
<p>病人冰凍五天施行醫療　經過佳良可愈癌腫</p>
<p>今據七月二日</p>
<p>美國密蘇利州聖路依斯城路透電云：現有一種醫學上空前之新試騐，即以病人，施行冰凍治療，使其陷於暫時之假死狀態。此事促進醫學界極端之注意，係由費辣苔菲亞城之鄧波費（Dr．Temple　S．Fay）與勞倫史密司（Dr．Lawrence　W．Suriah）兩大醫師，就其癌腫患者若干人中，實施試騐而得。彼倆尙欲以此冰凍療法，施以於肺病及心臟病癲狂症以及其他各種疾病之患者。</p>
<p>此種冰凍療法，已由二大醫師，報告於美國醫學會之年會上，其槪略如下：</p>
<p>病人脫衣裸臥</p>
<p>週身加以碎小冰塊，幷用電扇，旋轉煽鴦，如是經過三小時以後，病人體溫降至九十度以下，當即安然入睡，形似假寐。雖受凍殭，但其經過正常，毫無痛苦。室內保持相當冷度，以便碎冰移動時，亦仍照常寒冷。如是經過五日之久，然後進以熱咖啡以及熱飲料，喚醒病人。其時，病人面現微笑，而有喜色，但對一切經過情形，不復記憶。乃據病徵實騐所得，此種冰凍之冷力，對於猖獗繁殖之癌　細菌幼芽，至少可以殺滅百分之十以至百分之九十。</p>
<p>此種暫停生命</p>
<p>之療法，不僅驚愕於醫舉界，且於一時，不易令人知其優點所在，因此，促起醫學界，急於研究冰凍療法之必要步驟。</p>
<p>當其冰臥之時，病人脈搏停止，惟藉心動電流描記器（Electrocardiograph）、乃查吧表示其心臟，仍在跳動。最堪駭異者，即其經心跳，雖甚輕微，但其節拍完整，毫無異狀。又其腎臟以及消化器官，均已停止活動，但此僅屬尋常頻死之徵象而已，似無意外危險。因在同時，對其血液之分析，乃知體內已列渣滓廢料之充填，故亦無物堪以排泄也。</p>
<p>新陳代謝—滋養料促進生活力之程序—此時已由百分之二址，降至百分之十。總之，受有此種冰凍療法之病人，決不因此感染肺炎感冒，而其整個結構上細菌幼芽之發育，顯已大受陰碍矣。</p>

<p>眞正的套頭呢料、是呢絨行號直接向外國廠家特別訂定的、（少數高尙西服店家亦有自定的、）花式例多每套一種、數量以「冠料」每套三碼二五爲足、假使要辨別套頭呢料的眞僞、只要認看那套料末尾的碼牌就好了、因爲碼牌上、是印明着那套套料的出產處、廠名·地名·數量·和號碼等等的、</p>

<p>套頭呢料的價格、每套大多得在一百元之外、百元關內的、眞是少之又少、最近自外匯大縮、非二百元左右不能購置一套了、（駿）</p>

<p>粉市毫無變化、客銷依然呆滞、南北兩幫除少數零星點綴外、迄無大額去化、而廠方鑒於客銷一時尙無希望、且値炎暑、故暫將一部份停車、以冀生產略爲减少、此亦受環境所支配也、昨日統市交易仍恃本街零批爲主、計由本街及內地帮辦去各牌二號粉的計一萬餘包、價仍爲四元六角半現鈔、現洋粉喊價尚須四元七角半現鈔、但亦屬有行無市而已、</p>
<p>麥市趨勢績降、因滬寗路帶、到貨逐漸增多、而華廠則以粉銷久滯、洋麥存積尙充、迄無正式辦意、更兼澳洲洋麥又有一船將到、人心益形不支、本街囤戶均鮮問津、僅恃日廠一路取辦、統市成交南京蕪湖常州丹陽等麥共計一千五百餘包、價六元六角七分至五角八分、較前續降數分至一角左右云、</p>

<p>變元　亦續步低二角、惟因市價已低、已引起問津矣、</p>
<p>客秈　昨晨開市後、本客進胃均懈、且傳產地報小、更可照常搬運、因此一部份行囤客販頗有貶價求脫、旋被粳米狂瀉影響、市面允見下趨、高决各檔一致猛落、較小二三四角不等、宿决者更爲軟弱、繼有杭州等內地帮趁小收買近千包、本街鄉莊亦稍問津、市乃漸見回定、而全日成交數、亦加至三千包云、</p>

<h3 id="c110">廣智 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>誰都願意做聰明人，智者，不願意做蠢笨人，愚者，因爲聰明人處處佔使宜，蠢笨人處處吃虧，而誰都願意佔便宜而不願意吃虧。因此，誰都要聰明，不聰明要研究，甚至不妨「自作」起來。聰明旣有如此的需要，我將牠，智，聰明的另一名稱，廣一下，不至於是不智的辦法吧。不過我得聲明，我所謂廣者，還是於一般所謂的聰明之外，必須有所增加，有所替代之故，於是：</p>
<p>從一個人的幼年說起。幼年的孩提，我們以前所知道的聰明是應對進退，彬彬有禮，或者會吟詩作對，被譽爲神童。現在的聰明孩子則不然：會掉槍花，會騙入，會油嘴滑舌，會講都市下流社會的俚言俗語，會罵人，會偷家裹甚至別人的東西，會賭錢，……</p>
<p>在學校裏，不論是小中大那一等學校，以前我們所看見的聰明學生是：讀書成績好，學問有根秖，即使在科舉時代，所看重的聰明學生也是會做文章，會憑着眞才實學，入學中舉考進士。現在則又不然：第一，只要有錢，可以按步就班，買到洋博士爲止，眞正讀書的聰明為不必要，於是聰明的天才，用之於他途：考試時請同學「派司」，自己抄襲，請敎員的客，……據說，有幾個學校，甚至不必去上課，一樣可以有學期成續和畢業成績，有幾個國外學校，甚至不必到校，一樣可以取到牠們的博士等學位，這些當然又是聰明學生的好手段。</p>
<p>一入社會，新式的聰明花樣，就格外多了，博而的之，彙成原則，則有：識時務者爲俊傑，好漢不吃眼前虧，見風使舵，手臂望裹彎，偷拳頭，損人利己，……而原來所謂一智者不惑」，明事理，辨是非，諸般經天偉地之才，處世爲人之道，爲古聖先賢所稱道者，不預焉。最使我佩服的，是他們這些人的善於假癡假呆，就是所謂「若愚」或「若拙」，在對於他們不利時，坦然施展出來。因爲他們假使單單有那些「大智」或「大巧」的存心，而沒有這種「大智」或「大巧」的表演，假癡假呆，他們是要功虧一簣，難於成功的。惟其他們能够假癡假呆，於是人們可以被他們瞞過，以施行他們偷犬換日頭的手段。</p>
<p>自然，我的意思只是將從前和現在的所謂聰明智慧，作一會比較，推廣其範圍而已，並不想抑彼揚此，或輕此重彼。萬一有人要我表示一些意見，考考我的聰明程度，那末，我的確要說，現在的智是適合時代的，衆醉，餔其糟而啜其醨就是了，何必獨醒，適成其爲「阿木林」！假使你以爲這不是我的由衷之言，我也沒法使你相信，因爲我畢竟並非智者，可以說得天花亂墜；不過請你看看他們的結果，你就可以相信：</p>
<p>一個孩子，有了現代的廣智，就可以得到父母的歡心，親族的稱讚，被譽爲乖孩子，千里駒，克家令子；一個學生，有了現代的廣智，就可以讀書不費氣力，穩步登天，取靑紫如拾芥；至於一個成人，在社會中有了廣智，那當然更其可以建功立業，爲聞人，爲名流，爲富翁，爲高官，給人稱羨，認爲人生到此，並不寃枉。你看，他們不都是天之驕子，現代的成功者麽？那末你也就可以相信我對於他們的崇拜了；因爲崇拜成功者，是古今人的通例，我也未能免俗，故而有此中心悅而誠服也的崇拜，因崇拜而願人人有此廣智，也就可見是我的至心誠意了。</p>
<p>所困難的是，這樣的廣智雖然也可以用學習和修養來獲得，而由於其人的得天獨厚，却究竟是不易的定理。像我，天份就差得多，甚至「千慮」而無「一得」，只好眼看別人的「千慮」而無「一失」，深深地鼓羨着。未能廣己，焉能廣人，也許我之所廣，給眞正的智者看來，不値一笑吧。</p>

<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>——戰地追記</p>
<p>折回商城，知道章乃器先生已經徒步入皖了。也許大華飯店交進『鴻運』，竟掛上了『客滿』牌子，掌櫃表示着不能通融的歉意，眞有點進退兩難起來；因爲距離戒嚴時間祇有半小時，要是住夜問題不能解決，除了街頭露宿，此外就沒有辦法；露宿原算不了什麽一回事，但吳小姐跟小沈却不的而同的生起瘧疾來，所帶的奎寗藥片，偏又一路送光了。大家正在躊躇的當兒，老姚忽然在旅客名牌上發現了熟人——冷雋，「啊，雋人也在這裹，問題解決了，」他簡直像發現了新大陸一樣，指手畫脚跳躍起來。於是由掌櫃引道，跑進院子，穿過一條黝暗的背弄，果然在十四號房問見到了那位『同路人』。</p>
<p>「你怎麽還沒有回安徽？」雋人笑容可掬地問，但顯然有點驚疑的神氣。</p>
<p>「可不是，圈子兜大啦！」我簡單地答復着。</p>
<p>說起雋人，就想到他在漢口告訴我的故事：當盧溝橋的曉月被黑影吞沒了之後，山東韓復榘的熊度到底如何，便立刻使人感到憂慮；這就是說，「韓靑天』能不能負起守土的責任，而給予南下的他們迎頭痛擊，彷彿成了一個不易猜度的謎。就在這時侯，他率領着第二宣傅大隊從南京渡江出發，溯平浦路北上，待到了泰安，而放棄德州的消息便證實了，而且復電拒絕宣傳隊的走進濟南。「老韓眞靠不住，」事實證明了他的憂慮，只得退回徐州，跟第一大隊會合，取道隴海綫往鄭州。「老韓自己不肯打，又不讓別人開進他的防地，在一髮千鈞的緊要關頭，居然還存着封建的地盤思想，並且拱手送掉了濟南，這傢伙實在要不得！」他在『韓靑天』伏法的前夜，仍這樣憤慨地說。</p>
<p>這决他被派到皖西去，原因是「人地相宜」。他的確是挺肯負責的鬥士，「我要跟立煌共存亡！」他堅決地宣言說。直到現在，他果然沒有離開偉大的大別山，沒有拋棄神聖的工作。</p>
<p>當夜，我們安了兩位病人，便席地而臥；斗大的一問破屋，由十二個人平均分配，不要說伸腰，述伸脚都很困難。「聽說六安已經接觸了，你有沒有知道？」他又開動了話匣子，將獨山周圍的形勢傾述着，同時把地圖打開來，詳細地研究了一下，「六安也許不容易久守的，祇要麻埠能够保牢，他們要是再向東南挺進，那就自投羅網了！」他說，快意的微笑，從他瘦削的臉上掠過去，大家的精神似乎越加振舊起來，我便在他的那冊「全國分省精圖」上題了一首七律：</p>
<p>茫茫禹城渺無垠，客裏披圖搔首頻；</p>
<p>西北巖疆嗟破碎，東南半壁復沉淪！</p>
<p>攘夷惟有同流血，衛國豈徒效臥薪？</p>
<p>會看收京歌凱日，共君江上去垂綸。</p>

<p>— 公超</p>
<p>「甜心」是愛人的別稱；但現在却成爲一部運輸車的名字</p>
<p>李開興是一個二十二歲的靑年，他的父親是馬尼拉的富商。戰事爆發前，他担任一家日文報館的訪員，除感語外，還會講流利的美，日，法等國語言。七七事變發生，他立刻辭職。於一九三八年和同志的朋友們一齊回國，在祖國的軍隊裹，開始了運輸車駕駛員的生活。</p>
<p>他們這菲律濱華僑戰地服務團，一共有十五個，矯健的靑年團員。李開興就担任團長。每個人都出身於富裕的家庭，但是他們敝展了享樂的生活，駕着運輸車，馴驅於揚子江南岸的戰區裹，把軍用品運到前錢，受傷者送回後方。他們立誓長留在祖國的土地上，繼續這種有價值的工作，直到最後勝利實現的那一天。</p>
<p>李團長，和一切團員一樣，帶了自己的車子回到祖國來，他愛護這部車子，正和愛護情人一樣熱烈，親切，常常自己洗滌，修理，從不假手他人。他稱牠爲“Second　Sweatheart”（第二個甜心）。有一天，當他們正在前綫馳騁的時候，忽然遇着飛機，牠追躡着他們用炸彈森炸，用機槍掃射。李的車子，就帶了十五個槍眼。——也僅僅十五個槍眼罷了，此外毫髪未受損傷。而這十五個槍眼，李開興以爲是牠的最美的服飾。</p>
<p>李的第一個甜心是他那年輕美麗的妻子。他們結褵後四十四天，他就離開她，回到祖國來服務了。這位年青的團長每月獲得生活費六十元，把一半寄給了妻子。一半留着自己用，大部份却買了香烟。當他必須在大雨滂沱之下，或一片漆黑的深夜裹一連駕駛幾個鐘頭的時候，香烟是他唯一的好伴侶。</p>
<p>他常在路上奔波，不能有規律地日進三餐，因此，他的工具箱裹常常充滿着零星的食物，以便隨時充饑。挨餓一整天，或一連二三夜不得休息，這樣的生活對於這位富商之子，是很新奇的，而他爲了祖國的生存，很高興地過着這種生活。</p>
<p>經過一年的服務時問，不但李的車子有了十五個槍眼，其餘十四部車子也是彈痕纍纍。但幸運得很，雖然不斷受着轟炸，掃射，他們中只有一僩在腿上受了傷，到軍醫院裹去休養着。</p>
<p>他們的團裹，充滿着友愛精神。不論何時，何地，一聽到求救的暗號，大家就奔集相援。當他們休暇的時候，他們叉是最活躍的一羣，給在司令部裹或醫院中休息，療傷的武裝同胞們熱烈地敎着菲律濱民歌，土風舞，島國遊戲。</p>

<p>「打我嗎？」阿玖斯尼亞问他。</p>
<p>「是！不打不成……」瓦西卡說。</p>
<p>他們走到廚房時，他命令她脫掉衣服。</p>
<p>「請別打得太狠呀……」阿玫斯尼亞哀求着。</p>
<p>『哼，好的好的……』</p>
<p>她脫得只剩一件襯衫。</p>
<p>『再脫！』瓦西卡命令着。</p>
<p>『什麽，你可不知羞恥的！』她歎息着連裹衣都脫下來了。</p>
<p>瓦西卡鞭打着她的肩頭。</p>
<p>『你到底要怎様呢？現在不是冬天嗎？……我會凍死啊……』</p>
<p>「正要你凍死呀！你還在發昏呢？……」</p>
<p>他把她推出廚房門口拿皮鞭打着。打到大門口，趕到院子裹，就命令她躺在雪堆上。</p>
<p>「瓦西亞……你眞的？」</p>
<p>「快，快！」</p>
<p>於他把她的臉掀倒在雪裏去，把她的頭埋進雪裹，悶住她的呌聲，鞭打她好久好久，一邊說：</p>
<p>「你睡，你睡，你睡……」</p>
<p>等他放了她時，她因了痛苦和寒冷抖着，一面流着淚，一面後悔的，對他說：</p>
<p>「瞧著，瓦西卡！你會碰到我手裹的，……那時你別哭，老天有眼睛的呀！瓦西卡！</p>
<p>「儘你嚼舌根去！」他不當回事的說。</p>
<p>「你再在客堂裹睡陲看！那我就把你拖到院子裹，拋掉，拿水灌你頂，……」</p>
<p>人生自有他的　智，那名字呌做「機會」！它時常給予我們許多酬報。然而更其常見的是復仇，正如太陽給每件物事以蔭影一樣，人生的睿智總無時無地都準備着對各各的行復仇。這是確實的，這是不可避免的，而且是我們都應該知道這而且想到這，……（六）</p>

<p>— （新夢）</p>
<p>一張死亡表格損失大於戰事</p>
<p>健身房內每晚放映衛生電影</p>
<p>八仙橋青年會照例每年要舉行一次衛生運動的，這一次自十日起又舉行一個衛生教育週，一共七天，到十六日閉幕。的確，住在上海的人們，尤其是在今日的情形之下，每一個人能够注意衛生，才能免除疫病。所以舉行公開的衛生運動，來增進一般市民的衛生常識，自有其重要的意義。</p>
<p>在衛生教育週內，青年會用種種方法，使人增進衛生常識，所以這幾天你到八仙橋青年會去，走到樓上，就可見滿處貼有圖畫標語。人體是如何構成，疫病怎樣可怕，傳染病的媒介是什麼，人們用什麼方法才可預防傳染疾病？除了圖畫之外，更有標語，都是很警惕的，使人目覩之下，立刻可理會到衛生的重要。</p>
<p>好多圖表的裹面，特別使人注意的是中間的一副巨畫。居中寫着字句，說明：「歐美各國，每年的死亡率，每千人中有十五人，中國則在三十人以上。以四萬萬人口計算，每年死亡人數當在六百萬以上，損失的巨大，　任何戰爭為烈。枉死一人，使社會就遭受經濟上的損失，平均每人以五百元計，每年的損失，就有三十萬萬元。用此款可舉辦下列任何事業的一種：（一）建築鐵路三萬里；（二）開辦大工廠八百所；（三）開辦大學校一千所；（四）開辦小學校十萬所；（五）開辦醫院五千所；　建築城市自來水工程六百處；（六）修築柏油公路十萬里。四周有着象徵上面各種事業的圖畫，這筆損失有如此鉅大，的確是驚人的。</p>
<p>除了樓上以外，健身房的四壁，也　有各種　　表格。在這個衛生教育週內，青年會更派員往各里弄宣傳衛生教育，散發傳單，並舉行健康比賽，每天的晚上，有名人演講，和各種　藝表演，放映衛生影片，地點就在健身房裹，參觀不必購票，可在該會事務所索取入座券的。開幕的第一天，七時還沒有到，青年會的健身房內，已擠滿了人，娘兒們倒也不少，但小朋友的數字却比大人多。</p>
<p>七點鐘開始演講，主講的是黃子芳醫師，講題是「都市生活與公衆衛生。」他在簡短的演講詞中，　於都市中人對於衛生問題，特別是個人衛生，應怎樣的注意，說得很明白，更指出好多衛生的方法。演講完畢之後，由兩江及　國女體師的女同學作體育表演，內中以機械表演和火棍最精彩。還有猶太難童，表演單人舞，德國操，使人對於這一羣從德國新近逃出來的小難民，格外同情。最後放映衛生影片，一共兩部，「身體的構造」和「衣服的清潔」，是科達公司特製的。據說在這一星期中，游藝節目和影片是逐日更換，完全不同的，這樣的宣傳衛生教育，造福人羣，自然不淺哩。</p>
<h3 id="c119">惇信路第一難童學校　病童實驗班參觀記 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 慕徐</p>
<p>皮膚病童約佔百分之二十</p>
<p>悉心醫療痊瘉回原級上課</p>
<p>我這次到惇信路第一收容所去，參觀了「上海難民救濟協會第一難童學校」的病童實驗班。這種重視兒童健康的設施，非常重要，很有為文介紹的價值。</p>
<p>我去參觀的那天是在下午，當身軀　　的徐校長帶我進教室的時候，一個青年教師正向病童講述衛生常識。墻壁上　着不少的衛生掛圖與疾病統計圖表。他們都精神飽滿，聽得津津有味。向右面一看，那知教室的佈置，不同平常　空間從隔一幅藍色的布幕，「幕內還有什麼？」我經校長帶領，掀幕一看，裹面有十幾個赤祼祼的一絲不掛的兒童，身體上部患著膿血的疥瘡，一個年輕的女醫師，也就是收容所內小醫院的醫士，笑嘻嘻的替病童洗滌跟醫療。那些病童，已經快要痊瘉，他們白嫩的皮膚上，却留着不少的疥瘡的　痕，昭示着醫療的成績。還有十幾個患　　頭的兒童，交互的在下洗　，敷藥。我問一個十歲的病童：「你的皮膚病好得多了罷？」</p>
<p>「我的疥瘡，已生了一年又七月，」他含笑地答，「自入病童班每日醫療之後，　病一天天减少，疥瘡一天天就痊，朱先生告訴我，再過一週，就要痊瘉了。」當時，校長檢出該生的一張醫療記載表給我看，表上顯示着　漸就痊的良果，我不由的替這般受　苦難的病童慶幸不置。</p>
<p>據校長說：「這是病童實騐級的午斑，還有早班在上午七時至十時上課。兩班共有一百多人。這般治瘉的病童，不久就要重回原學級上課。有一個患了九年疥瘡的兒童，目下也已治瘉。他們因為身體恢復了健康，學業乃加倍的進步，就是心理的衛生，也無形　飛速的增進。最近，全校學生數比開學時增加了三百多名，患皮膚病的約佔百分之二十，刻正計劃添設晚班的病童級，以適應當前的需要，普救苦難的病童。」</p>
<p>在歐美各國，重視特種教育的設施，其中的露天學校，就是選取身心虛弱的兒童？一面治療，一面施教，等他們體健恢復以後，再回原校讀書。該校病童班的創辦，是和露天學校可以媲美的。</p>

<p>— 風波</p>
<p>衣服像在河流中浸過一樣</p>
<p>頭腦被熱度熏得暈濁發漲</p>
<p>一個銀樓學徒的生活報告</p>
<p>五點鐘起身，望望　　表的水銀柱停　在九十度，周遭連一絲微風都沒有，知道今天氣候一定熱得利害。</p>
<p>匆匆做完了學徒應做的工作，就跑到先生們的臥室中，更換起破舊的青布短衫褲，揀選了幾隻　周的上紅色的　子。「怪熱天，烤金子，生爐了，真犯關囉！」睡在床上的寗波胖先生望了望我，眼光中好像閃耀出無限惻隱憐惜的金星。</p>
<p>我笑了笑，迅速地鑽進了爐房。將灰與炭　出清後，立刻生起爐灶來，熊熊的火光透過了堆積像邱陵般的炭　，照　在十幾尺寬的屋子內。等所有的炭全部燒得泛起了紅光的時候，將罐子里盛着的熱炭倒除在一旁，然後把它煨在炭的中央。</p>
<p>約二小時後，罐子紅了，我們的工作——溶金子，也就正式開始。風　呼拍呼拍的開始拉起來，巨大的火　又重新　起，冒出萬丈的光華。青藍色的火舌緊接着火柱，不時地跳躍得很高很長，冷炭驟然遇到強烈的勢力，劈拍劈拍的炸烈起來，跟着火星四濺，臉上手上胸口，都可能的時時蒙受它的突擊。</p>
<p>罐子紅得透時了，金黃色的金子分批的投入，於是，我用盡了所有的氣力，急促拉着龐大的風箱，呼拍呼拍震動了我的耳膜，　　了我的頭腦。</p>
<p>把度的火力將金子也演成了液汁，不用說，我們的皮膚給火燄薰得一個個毛孔像在炸裂，甚至於　大了。衣服因為拼命地工作，竟像浸沉河裹一樣，額上的汗，像雨下的滴下，　去了後又湧出，只好任讓它去。努力地拉着風箱，盡管頭腦在暈濁發漲，也不能稍微鬆懈。否則，金子將要頓破罐子而逃漏，這暗賬是永遠被我們認為最可怖的成　；它使我們服服貼貼的努力演金子。演好了一罐又一罐，眼看着還有許多未溶的金子時，心頭雖冒起萬丈火燄，但工作更努力了。</p>
<p>溶好了金子，走出爐房的時候，雖站在熱得發燒的日光下，却也已感到無限的凉快，你想從幾百度的爐房裹，回到百度的自然下，怎　不可算幸福透了呢？那裹　會嚷着熱呢</p>

<p>且說朱村長陪同何家兩位小姐，以及愛人愛　等，從省立第十三　種製造來，天色已經　暮了。　雙　等這一回來，不預備　在自由村，還是跟隨着朱愛人回去。到下一個星期日，再到自由村來。倘然下一個星期日，愛人有睱的，依然坐了她的車子同來。假使她沒有工夫，也不要緊，她姐姊妹倆，也可以來。因為從安樂鎮到自由村，有公共汽車，來往也很是使得。而且何　玉她們，以前在美國曾學開汽車，但沒有像朱愛人，金澹雲那般熟　。歸國以後，因為她們家裹雇有汽車夫，不大開車，要得生疏。到　此地見許多姊妹們都是自己開車。因想到將來在此地開辦工廠，也非有汽車不可，自已開車，就自己便當，因此也想學習開車。她們本來就會開車的，稍為借愛人的車子習練幾次就成了。近來有許多姑娘們，學習駕駛飛機的也很多，開汽車更當是　得普及咧。那時他們再回到朱村長家裹，朱太太還想留他們吃了夜飯回去。倒是朱村長說：『她們旣不住在這裹，還是讓她們早一點回去吧！下一星期來，可以看看我們新村的設備。這是一個白地建設起來的新村，不能說怎樣的發展，我們就想在這個小範圍內，一步一步的做去。希望每村如此，也就好了。』原來像自由村那樣的前途，不愁它不繁榮，只怕它不能整齊攬　，朱村長就是要守住那一點良好的鄉風。因此凡是有一家人家，遷移到自由村來的，他們要經幾度審查，方許他們　來。第一，倘然是個沒有職業的人，僅僅靠一些產業的有產階級，惟以坐食為事的，他們便不願意他來。就是有職業的人，也須審查他是什麼職業，倘然從事於大都市那種奢華職業的，他們也不願意他來。他們自由村有自由村的規約，要能守他們村中規約的，方許算他們的村民。倘然違背了他們村中的規約的，小則警戒懲罰，大則就要請他搬出這自由村了。因為住在自由村的人，大家有天賦　有的自由，要是你犯了規約，妨害到別人的自由，那就不客氣，教你也失去自由了。（一五七）</p>

<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>結論是「必紅無疑」</p>
<p>玉蘭在校，成績甚佳，（成績係劇藝，實習，文藝，操行四種總平均。）自二十四年度第一學期至二十七年度第一學期，七個學期考試，玉蘭考列甲等第一名者四次，其餘均在前五名內。因其勤學好問，志趣純潔，品行端正，師長與學友均重視之。畢業後，戲校聘為助教，並留校參加實習公演。　嘯伯組班，特約其合作，並牌合演，　客常滿，聲譽　起。與奚合作第一聲，為王寶釧之武家坡三　，凌　漢閣特往觀之，有短評一則，文曰：</p>
<p>『侯玉蘭菩宏　而唱細緻，氣象非凡。她這回好比諸葛亮初出茅廬第一功，前程遠大。當樓上樓下掌聲雷動之時，　　合掌向　土致敬三十分之久，祝此「女侯爺」之速速升到「大王。」』</p>
<p>玉蘭搭外班後，舊都評劇家劉步堂君有兩點感想：</p>
<p>『二十年來旦角一席，無疑的由梅氏領銜，程荀尚佐之，成為四大名旦局勢。今也四氏行將老矣，所謂四小名旦者，能否承繼衣缽，尚在未定之天。斯時也，戲校高材生侯玉蘭出而問世。</p>
<p>侯生之　如何，在社會上已有定評。顧其個人之勤，儉，孝，謙，實為將來成大器之由。書至此，不佞有兩種感想：（一）為今之所謂四小名旦揑一把汗。（二）將來繼梅等之稱旦界王座者，為男乎？　為女乎？又將與孟小冬之　生牛耳有一質疑之價值焉。』玉蘭　性渾厚，天真爛縵。事　盡孝。待人誠實正直，彬彬有禮。自奉儉樓，不　時尚。畢業後捧角者未嘗一登其門，而報上仍有譽無毀，可見公道自在人心，為女演員開一新紀録。玉蘭此次應聘來　，凌　漢　臨別贈言：</p>
<p>『……願她將來得一藝員伴侶，以戲劇終身。如喜彩　之例，夫唱婦隨，或婦唱夫隨。』</p>
<p>玉蘭登臺後，愚觀其劇者已兩次：一為「販馬記」，一為「四郎探母」，　其唱工，念白，表情，以及手　身法步，無一不合成名角之條件，販馬記尤為滿意，吾今效老友蘇少卿先生之言曰：「此　必紅無疑！」</p>

<p>— 周璇</p>
<p>島上市容　潔，椰子樹到處點　着明媚風光，印象可說是很好，不過氣候實在太熱了。我們一行團員全住在戲院裹，白天裹簡直熱得不能出門，日常的表演，也只晚間八時至十時一塲。唯一的特殊生活，每天自晨至暮，身上總得用冷水沖洗幾次，要不然，就會生起病來。</p>
<p>這裹的僑胞很多，大部份全是福建人和廣東人；某國人開的商店也不少；可是僑胞都很熱心，絕對不到那裹去購物的。假如有人貿然失察，跑了進去；立刻便會引起路人注目，寫一字條去　　代言；那人如能認錯還只罷了，否則明天經報上宣布出來，那就是一件難以見人的莫大恥事。我們許多夥伴自知人地生疎，要出去買東西時，因亦深具戒心，非得諸人引導不可。</p>
<p>全島區域極小——看來還沒有上海公共租界那裹廣大。一條名呌「美國街」的馬路上，高級的外國電影院多至七八家；開映國產片的戲院，亦有「中央」「亞洲」兩處，上海許多新出品，且都映得很早。全市交通工具，電車是沒有的，汽車亦甚少，只有馬車最多而又很便宜；祇須五分錢，就得隨便趁往各處。在晚間海風飄拂中，我就最喜歡坐這馬車去沿海兜風。</p>
<p>我們出演的所在，就是那家亞洲大戲院。這時期正值廢　新年，　價分一元，五角兩等，每天都是擁擠不堪。表演節目規定每天十種，每三天更換一次，末塲戲是我的話劇。這裹係歸美國統治，好得　演期之內，演了九個劇月；僑胞們的愛國心真熱烈極了，每次遇有激昂慷　的表演，或是揚起有國旗的，總得掌聲雷動，歡　若狂的來上一番狂熱的騷動，我們在舞臺，因此分外興奮其至興奮到禁不住流下淚來因為氣候太炎熱，這生活實在過不慣；當在演滿兩個月以後，我們更都急於歸　，重回上海來了。我知道自己年紀太輕，無甚閱歷，但有一點感想，認為海外直傳是一件很急要的工作。</p>

<h3 id="c127">口琴隊在上海 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— 李馨吾</p>
<p>口琴界史科之一</p>
<p>口琴的玩意，自經幾位名家宣傳提倡以後，曾吸引了許多青年羣衆。上海可以說是中國口琴音樂的發祥地，數年以來，人才輩出，到處可以聽見口琴的演奏，其中更有許多集合吹奏的口琴隊，仿大樂隊的組織，奏大樂隊的樂曲，不獨顯露藝術的價值，抑且發揮合　的精神，雖然表現力量終覺渺小，可是凡事從小做起，它們却負着發揚光大的使命呢！</p>
<p>在上海，最上的口琴隊當推　夏大學口琴隊，那時大約在民國十八年，其次是中華口琴隊。以後五年中，人才愈出愈多，就有青年會的大華口琴隊以及光明，青光等隊損　成立，其餘小隊，不知其數。不過那時正在萌芽時代，一切都很幼稚，直到最近的三五年中，才突飛猛進，那些落伍的口琴隊也漸歸淘汰。　下在這　島上，規模較大而陣容挺秀的口琴隊，共有四個，它們各有相當的地位和聲望，而且　在進步之中。這裹值得把它們的概況來說一說：</p>
<p>（一）中華口琴隊</p>
<p>它的資格最老，將有十年的歷史，中間經過不少滄　之變，迄今猶能存在，總算很不容易。指導人為王氏兄弟，是一對不知為何人的口琴專家，從學的人極多。現有基本隊員約二三十人，至於附從隊員，則復分甲，乙，丙，丁及女子五隊，合計人數在一百以上。樂隊的內容，除以大小各種口琴為主體外，另外加入大低音提琴，手風琴，六小鼓定音鼓等樂器，組織之完備，為其他各隊所不及。</p>
<p>（二）大衆口琴隊</p>
<p>它是常年喧嚇一時的青年會大華口琴隊的化身，隸屬於大衆口琴會，由上海極有名的口琴家石人望氏領導，已有三年多的歷史，隊員也　着不少。石氏因「我主耶穌」的關係，在教會團體中很占勢力。他隊中的特點；就是有大掛手　琴為伴奏，對於演奏聖樂（Sacred　　fus　）之類，極能顯出和聲的優美。</p>
<p>（三）上海口琴隊</p>
<p>隸屬於上海口琴會，是前大上海口琴隊所改組領導人為陳劍晨氏。這一隊規模較小，　全隊的精神極佳，大家都肯　幹，其作風完全不脫初時期中華口琴隊的本色，這也許是領導人出身中華的緣故。最近該隊也在人丁興旺中。</p>
<p>（四）華聯口琴隊</p>
<p>隸屬於華聯同樂會，它的隊員全是以上各隊的優秀隊員，因此陣容極強。指導者為，郁郁星氏，是一個為口琴界中很有名的人物，可是他是一個「悲觀派」的青年，須等他興奮的時候，方能領導他的隊員大步　進，華聯口琴隊就在這個狀况下支持着。這一隊是一個純綷業餘的組織，也可說是全滬名流會萃之所，祇可惜組織上太散漫一些，如果振作起來，定能　倒一切。</p>
<p>在不久以前，有幾位口琴界的領袖人物，曾發動過一次全滬各口琴隊聯觀會，出席者不下二三百人。我想如果這麼許多名手來舉行一次慈善性質的聯合演奏會，定能轟動一時，不知口琴的名家們肯為難胞造福否？</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) A dispatch from Chongqing reports that the focus of the war remains in Shanxi. The Japanese army has launched another fierce offensive, with over ten thousand troops advancing along the Datong-Puzhou Railway towards towns in southern Shanxi. The vanguard, comprising three to four thousand soldiers, is operating in the areas of Anyi, Xiaxian, Jiangxian, and Wenxi, as well as north of Zhongtiao Mountain, where fighting continues. In eastern Shanxi, three to four thousand Japanese troops are engaged in combat with Chinese forces near Qin County and Qinyuan County for three days and nights. Their momentum is gradually waning, and the battle situation is stabilizing. Chinese reinforcements have successively reached their destinations and are advancing in separate directions, with successful counteroffensives expected to bring further victories. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese military sources, Japanese naval landing forces, under cover of intense naval artillery fire and aerial bombardment, landed at Dongliu and Liushui on the northern part of Pingtan Island (fifty kilometers east of Fuqing County, Fujian Province). They then captured Pingtan County. Chinese forces have retreated to newly constructed defensive positions outside Pingtan City and are continuing to resist. (Eleventh Day Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman stated this afternoon at a press briefing that although the Japanese army's offensives in various parts of Shanxi Province appeared to be isolated, they were in fact ambitious actions aimed at encircling the Chinese forces east of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, south of the Zhengtai Railway, and north of the Yellow River. The Japanese have deployed more than four divisions for this decisive battle, launching simultaneous attacks from the east, west, and north to seize the Chinese forces defending the southeastern part of Shanxi Province.

<h3 id="e5">Possible Blockade of the Hankou Concession <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) The possibility of a blockade of the French Concession in Hankou has been increasing daily. A certain Mr. Zhang, the "mayor" of Hankou under Japanese protection, issued a note to French Consul General Renard, making three demands because the French Concession prohibited Chinese demonstrators from parading in the concession on July 7, the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War: (1) A formal apology for interfering with the movement to establish a New Order in East Asia. (2) The release of a certain Mr. Yang who was arrested for distributing flags. (3) The return of confiscated flags and leaflets. French Consul General Renard replied as follows: (1) The "mayor" should apologize because he did not notify the French authorities in advance that a parade would pass through the French Concession and obtain their consent. (2) There was no case of Mr. Yang being detained. (3) The flags have been distributed and the leaflets have been returned. A certain official of the "municipal government" said today that if satisfaction is not obtained, the supply of water and electricity to the French Concession will be cut off, but no deadline was mentioned. It is rumored that a certain party has requested that the French authorities de facto recognize the current Wuhan municipal government, but it is now known that this is not the case.

<p>Moscow: To mark the 15th anniversary of the founding of the "Outer Mongolian Republic," the army newspaper "Red Star" published a special edition, containing various articles. One article stated: "Outer Mongolia covers an area of 1.5 million square kilometers, with a population of 900,000. The Soviet government has no selfish intentions towards Outer Mongolia, so the people of Outer Mongolia regard us as friends and desire our assistance." As for the strength of the Outer Mongolian army, the newspaper did not reveal any surprising news, only stating that Outer Mongolia produces many horses, with an average of two horses per resident, so the army is mainly cavalry. 30% of the cavalry belongs to the People's Revolutionary Party, whose organization resembles the Communist Party. Another 50% of the cavalry are members of the Revolutionary Youth League. In addition, Outer Mongolia's tank and armored vehicle units are actively training and developing rapidly. Outer Mongolia currently has a military school, which has all the departments except for aviation. In short, the combat power of the Outer Mongolian army is exceptionally strong, and the soldiers are extremely resilient and accustomed to fighting in the desert. If Outer Mongolian territory is invaded in the future, the Soviet Union will regard it as its own territory and defend it. This has already been stated by Stalin and Molotov.

<p>Japanese-Soviet Aerial Combat Unfolds</p>
<p>An Eleventh-Day Reuters Dispatch from a Special Correspondent: Today, from an observation point three miles from the Khalkhin Gol River, I witnessed two Soviet air raids. The first one, under a bright blue sky, was an aerial dogfight. There were twenty-four Soviet aircraft, and the number of Japanese aircraft that met them was unclear. As a result, two Soviet aircraft were hit, caught fire, and crashed, while the remaining ones flew back to their base. Shortly after, eighteen more Soviet aircraft appeared in the sky, disregarding heavy anti-aircraft fire, and bombed the Japanese air force's water source. Later, I saw bomb fragments, which, according to the Japanese, were bacteriological bombs. The Soviets intended to use them to poison the water. The Soviet aircraft dropped a total of twenty-five bombs, which the Japanese are now collecting and sending to a chemical laboratory for analysis. Although the Japanese artillery and infantry launched a fierce attack, the Mongolian army is still holding the east bank of the Khalkhin Gol River, refusing to abandon the position which the Japanese claim was originally part of "Manchukuo."</p>

<h3 id="e10">Danzig and the European Situation <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhuoyu has submitted an article to this newspaper entitled, "Inferring the European Situation from the Danzig Question." This newspaper has repeatedly elaborated on Danzig and the European situation, presenting our views on each stage of its evolution. Mr. Wu, however, starts from the beginning, summarizing the historical and geographical causes and consequences. All this information belongs to the realm of public reality and is by no means a new discovery; but it is something that this newspaper has not previously narrated. We have excerpted Mr. Wu's article for publication, confident that readers will gain insight from it. The Reporter</p>
<p>The current tension in Europe hinges on the dispute between Germany and Poland over the Free City of Danzig. The key to the German-Polish dispute lies in "Danzig." Originally, Danzig was the port of exit for Poland's Vistula River, covering an area of only 754 square miles, with a population of 380,000, mostly Germans. After the European War, the League of Nations entrusted its administration to Poland. Danzig is Poland's only major commercial port on the Baltic Sea, and a major issue that Germany has never forgotten. After Hitler came to power, he signed a ten-year non-aggression pact with Poland, which he recently terminated. On the Polish side, in addition to obtaining the right to operate businesses in Danzig, a corridor was formed between western Germany and East Prussia, providing a vital sea outlet. However, Poland is also aware that the Danzig Free City will inevitably create problems sooner or later. Therefore, a new port, Gdynia, has been built north of Danzig to expand Poland's foreign trade and maintain Poland's sea route, as a landlocked Central European country. Germany is inherently ambitious, especially since Danzig is its former territory. Poland is well aware of Germany's ambitions and remains vigilant at all times; as once Danzig changes hands, the Polish Corridor would become practically useless, and its foreign trade would be on the verge of collapse. Therefore, in order to consolidate industry and commerce, work hard on construction, and invigorate the domestic economy, Poland must maintain Danzig and the corridor, as it concerns the fate of Poland and has no room for retreat. Even if war breaks out as a result, any sacrifice would be made without hesitation. This is why Poland is preparing for war and waiting for the destiny of Danzig.</p>
<p>As for Britain and France, the survival of Poland is of great concern to them, as most people understand. Since Hitler's arrogance was exposed, and after the seizure of Austria and Czechoslovakia, Britain felt that the prestige of the British Empire was under great threat, which is undeniable. Poland is located in the center of Europe, and the only way to achieve permanent peace in Europe is to guarantee Poland's independence. Because Poland borders Germany to the south, it serves as a barrier to Germany's expansion to the northeast; and because Poland is connected to the Soviet Union in the northeast, it acts as a long wall for the Western European countries. Therefore, Britain and France must guarantee Poland first in order to maintain their inherent dignity and prestige. Therefore, Chamberlain's statements on the German-Polish dispute are all very firm. As for France, the relationship between France and Poland is even more closely linked, as recognized by both countries; therefore, in February 1921, France and Poland established a treaty of alliance. For this reason, the actions of Britain, France, and Poland are consistent, and it is natural to expect that Britain and France will not stand idly by if Poland is attacked.</p>
<p>Hitler's style of aggression, both political and military, is demonstrated by the seizure of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Since its restoration, Poland has been acutely aware of its perilous situation. Therefore, Poland has been extremely active in diplomacy over the years. A prominent example is the signing of a treaty of alliance with Romania to prevent Germany from invading from the south; and because of the Ukrainian issue within the country, the Soviet-Polish treaty was signed with the Soviet Union on March 10, 1921. In 1932, a treaty of non-aggression was signed with the Soviet Union. In 1933, in order to solidify its international position and prevent other countries from taking action, Poland signed a definition treaty against aggression with the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Estonia, Latvia, Persia (now Iran), Romania, and Turkey. On one hand, it worked hard on domestic construction and military buildup. At the same time, in order to prevent Germany from starting trouble, Foreign Minister Beck negotiated diplomatic relations with Germany, and finally, on January 26, 1934, the German-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty was established, with a term of ten years. All of this is Poland's consistent policy of being wary and "guarding against thieves" for the past twenty years. As of today, Poland has an army of 1 million people, with reserves of 2 million, and the national population has also increased from 27.18 million to 35 million. Within the country, all industries, whether agricultural, commercial, or industrial, are being improved and developed. Poland has long affirmed that a major European war will break out sooner or later; and the disaster of national subjugation is what Poland has long since experienced.</p>

<p>Washington: US State Department officials announced last night that the United States has lodged new, strong protests with Japanese authorities in Tokyo, Washington, and Shanghai, objecting to the continued bombing of Chongqing by the Japanese air force. The lives and property of American nationals there are under threat from Japanese bombs. US Secretary of State Hull personally presented the aforementioned protest to Japanese Ambassador to the US, Horinouchi, yesterday. US Chargé d'Affaires to Tokyo, Dooman, also lodged a protest with the Japanese Foreign Ministry. US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, lodged the same protest with the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai on Saturday. The US protest condemned the Japanese bombing of Chongqing in its entirety, which has threatened the temporary embassy of the US in China and endangered the life of US Ambassador to China, Johnson. Some in diplomatic circles believe that the recent US protests are related to the US efforts to peacefully resolve the Tianjin incident. They believe the US has attempted to make Japan understand that the US continues to be and is extremely concerned about Japanese actions in China. (Eleventh Day Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

The National Daily was not affected because it was printed by the Southwest Printing Company, which has always treated its workers well. All other newspapers were unable to publish on the 11th.

<h3 id="e13">Qingdao Incident: Intense Anti-British Movement; Stones Destroy British Consulate and Seven British Shops <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Yesterday, Japanese and Chinese individuals here held an intense anti-British movement. Demonstrators destroyed the British consulate and seven British shops with stones. The British protection ship "Roseforth" plans to arrive here today to protect the lives and property of British expatriates. The British Consul-General in Qingdao lodged a serious protest with the Japanese authorities last night, stating that he had personally warned the Japanese Consul-General twenty-four hours earlier that he had obtained a plan by the Japanese to instigate an attack on the British Consulate. Britain intends to lodge a similar protest with the Tokyo authorities. According to reports, yesterday morning, in front of Japanese troops and Chinese police, a Chinese mob, mixed with many Japanese in plain clothes, paraded in front of the British Consulate, throwing large stones and firecrackers at the consulate building. Numerous large stones shattered the consulate's windows, scattering broken glass throughout the consulate's offices. The mob used firecrackers to shatter the glass and shouted anti-British slogans. The Japanese guards, who were officially requested by the British to protect the British Consulate, turned a blind eye to the throwing of large stones and firecrackers at the consulate and did not stop them. Although demonstrators were not allowed to enter the British Consulate's premises, the Japanese guards and Chinese police made no attempt to interfere with the attack on the consulate or other British property. Finally, the mob attacked seven British shops, smashing many glass windows with stones. Fortunately, none of the Britons who were attacked were injured, as they had fled to shelter before the glass windows were shattered. Britons walking on the street had already taken refuge before the mob approached. Japanese sources claimed that the demonstrators had been repelled by the Japanese marines and that no British property had been lost, but the British side has denied this claim. According to eyewitnesses, the Japanese marines did not attempt to disperse the demonstrators at the time, only preventing them from entering the British Consulate. Furthermore, after the incident, telegrams sent by foreign journalists were detained by Japanese inspectors and only allowed to pass after fourteen hours. (Eleventh Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) A group of Chinese people resumed an anti-British demonstration parade yesterday afternoon, marching in formation near the British Consulate here, throwing stones and setting off firecrackers, causing minor damage to the British Consulate. These Chinese also attacked two British bank buildings here, smashing doors and windows. Demonstrators distributed many anti-British leaflets during the parade. The police and guards made absolutely no effort to interfere with the marchers. The British Consul-General attaches great importance to this matter and is currently drafting a detailed report to London. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan Masses Party today instructed all provinces, cities, and villages to engage in anti-British movement activities, requesting that the party's branches pass resolutions urging the government to adopt a tough attitude towards Britain. At the same time, leaders within the party are likely to turn small grievances into major hatred, so the anti-British movement has the potential to expand nationwide. From today onwards, the Social Masses Party will also follow the example of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties and adopt a policy of opposing Japan's pro-British stance. The Tokyo People's Anti-British League is scheduled to convene a mass anti-British rally on July 14th, and the Osaka City Council also passed a largely anti-British resolution yesterday.

<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons today, Conservative MP Mrs. Claitzel urged Prime Minister Chamberlain to advise German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to extend the exchange plan agreed upon by Germany and Italy regarding the residents of Tyrol to the city of Danzig and the French protectorate of Tunisia in North Africa. (Note: There are Italian minorities in the German province of Tyrol, and German minorities in the Italian province of Tyrol. The residents of Danzig are mostly of German ethnicity, and there are many Italians in Tunisia.) Foreign Office official Butler immediately replied, "The Foreign Secretary, Halifax, is unable to express an opinion on whether the Tyrol resident exchange plan can be extended to Danzig and Tunisia. A suggestion can only be made after detailed information is received regarding a universal application of the exchange plan. In short, the government will pay attention to all important considerations regarding this matter." (Tenth Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Political figures here believe that Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on the Danzig issue in the House of Commons yesterday contained nothing new and failed to change the current situation. The general opinion is that "We should pay attention to Chamberlain's statement that both Germany and Poland were misled by unfounded rumors in March of this year and mobilized for no reason. As for Chamberlain's statement that the steps taken by Poland and the guarantees provided by Britain to Poland prove that the Prime Minister's measures are entirely malicious. Chamberlain believes that Danzig has become an international issue, which is a big mistake. The Danzig issue is only related to the citizens of Danzig themselves. The city of Danzig has the full right to determine its own destiny and does not need Britain to overstep its authority." (Eleventh Haitong Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The Times commented today on Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks on Danzig, stating that the positions of Britain and Germany are now very clear, leaving no room for misunderstanding.

<p>(Paris) The newspapers here today welcomed Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks yesterday, but a few commentators expressed concern about the Prime Minister's suggestion that negotiations might be possible between Poland and Germany. Le Peuple stated that Chamberlain clarified Britain's position without leaving any doubt. Le Figaro stated that the Prime Minister's words made it clear what value the Western European powers placed on their commitment to Poland. Le Petit Parisien stated that Chamberlain did not rule out the possibility of a peaceful solution, but this possibility seems very difficult to realize at this time. Le Temps stated that the Prime Minister's remarks regarding the possibility of negotiations were unfortunate, as Germany would only agree to reconcile with Poland after it ceded Danzig.

<p>Warsaw: Polish government officials recently declared that Prime Minister Chamberlain's firm statement in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government is determined to fulfill its guarantees to Poland has made Poland "very satisfied."

Although this declaration does not create new elements for the overall situation, it has confirmed the British government's attitude. (Eleventh Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) American newspapers criticizing Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday mostly said that they were a boundary stone on the road from Munich to Danzig. The New York Times stated that the position on the Vistula River is the last point of victorious resistance to military domination. There are two reasons why this position should be taken now: one is that Hitler is currently showing signs of hesitation, and the other is that if Britain and France do not provide assistance while the Anglo-Soviet stalemate continues, it is tantamount to inviting Hitler to move forward. Lippmann, a famous political commentator who has just returned to the United States from Europe, published an article in the New York Herald Tribune, stating that the situation has now reached the point where if the Axis powers want to achieve further significant conquests, it will inevitably lead to a full-scale war.

<p>(London) According to news from the British Air Ministry, British military aircraft began practicing in French airspace today. There are twelve squadrons participating, with a total of more than 150 aircraft, mostly medium and heavy bombers. All British military aircraft only soared in the sky after entering French territory and never landed. Each aircraft carries a sealed secret order that can only be opened after flying out of British territory. The British Air Ministry stated that the territory of the British mainland is not large enough for high-speed aircraft, and it is difficult to fully utilize their capabilities if they are limited to flying within the airspace. Furthermore, British aircraft pilots lack the opportunity to practice flying in foreign airspace, so flying to French airspace will definitely be beneficial. It is self-evident that the scale of participation in this decision is around 1,000 people. The French Air Ministry has agreed to provide all assistance and has indicated that it will send an aircraft squadron to British airspace for training. (Eleventh Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The Aviation Department, in order to actively train Air Force pilots, has dispatched twelve squadrons of bombers, totaling 150 aircraft, to France today with the consent of the French government for exercises. This is the first time that France has allowed the air force of another country to fly in its airspace during peacetime. It is reported that the bombers will fly to France via two routes. Several squadrons of heavy bombers plan to fly non-stop to the port of Bordeaux and then return, a total distance of 1,200 miles. The remaining squadrons are medium-sized bombers and will fly to the city of Le Mans via the northern city of Orleans and then return to the country, their routes forming a triangle. The aircraft are fully equipped, each carrying three to five pilots, and flying at an altitude of 6,000 feet. When passing through major cities, they will descend to 1,000 feet. The heavy bombers will fly in French airspace for up to five hours. (Eleventh Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Government authorities, in order to complete large-scale public works to promote "national interests," are actively promoting the "General Mobilization of Ordinary People" plan throughout the country. Many male employees of public and private institutions have been conscripted. After a medical examination, they are assigned to various local areas to build military projects, construct roads, and build a large station in Tempelhof Town near here. The vacancies left behind are to be filled as much as possible by female employees. Originally, the employees hired by small-scale shops in Germany already felt insufficient. Now, since the implementation of the "General Mobilization of Ordinary People" plan, it has become even more difficult to transfer them. All industries are affected, and it is said that the number of barbers who have been conscripted is the highest, accounting for 75% of the total. Many waiters in hotels and cafes have also been conscripted. As for workers in the transportation industry, their physical fitness is known to be strong, and they will be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort in various tasks. The government authorities have reportedly decided to conscript them all. In addition, government authorities have issued orders to the National Socialist Youth League, the Labor Front, and personnel from other National Socialist Party organizations, university students, and army soldiers to participate in wheat harvesting work.

<h3 id="e25">US Neutrality Law Amendment Issue; Affects Entire Foreign Policy; Isolationist Forces in Congress Growing Stronger; Roosevelt Prepares to Exert Full Effort to Fight <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to study the Neutrality Law issue in order to decide whether to submit the Bloom Bill with the Willis Amendment attached (Note: The Willis Amendment stipulates the maintenance of the arms embargo clause) to the Senate for discussion, or to choose another one among various proposals. The State Department and political figures are currently silent. However, among the 96 members of the Senate, 34 have agreed to oppose any suggestions that the current government may put forward, and are vehemently opposed to the abolition of the arms embargo clause. When the Senate discussed the bill to extend the President's monetary and financial powers some time ago, only 6 senators used delaying tactics, and the bill was not passed in time. Now that there are 34 opponents, it is feared that it will not be easy for the Neutrality Law issue to reach a decision during the current session of Congress. In addition, the government forces in the Foreign Relations Committee are only on par with the opposition. If the committee cannot reach a clear conclusion at its meeting tomorrow, the government's proposal to submit the Neutrality Law issue to the Senate for discussion may be temporarily abandoned. In recent days, the Neutrality Law issue has taken on political significance, unlike when the House of Representatives began discussing it. The issue of whether to retain or abolish the arms embargo clause was originally the crux of the matter, but in the view of most congressmen, this point has receded to a secondary position and will not seriously affect the attitude of the United States after a war occurs in the future. The current situation has actually evolved into a dispute between President Roosevelt and Congress over the entire foreign policy. The President's current foreign policy is to work for the maintenance of world peace. Although its outline has won the support of the majority of public opinion, there is no shortage of congressional representatives who oppose it, saying that everything that hinders the complete independence and absolute neutrality of the United States is what the people urgently want to avoid. Therefore, President Roosevelt may depart early to tour the Pacific coast states and deliver several speeches along the way to defend the current foreign policy. (Tenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Bloom, the drafter of the Bloom Neutrality Law, declared today that the government still hopes to have the bill voted on in the Senate.

As for the figures for any particular country, they have never been published as a matter of practice.

<p>(Tientsin) After a few days of calm here, two incidents occurred again this morning: (1) The British resident, Howorth, who was previously subjected to the humiliation of a strip search, entered the British Concession this morning with three other British people. The others were not inconvenienced and were allowed to pass, but Howorth was again ordered by the Japanese to take off his shoes and socks for detailed inspection, and then ordered to take off his trousers for a thorough search, before being allowed to enter the British Concession. (2) At 9:00 a.m. this morning, a Chinese sampan carrying many passengers from the Third Special District arrived at the British Concession. The passengers immediately dispersed, leaving only the boatman on board. A few minutes later, several armed Chinese and Japanese police officers arrived at the British Concession in a small boat, docked by the river. Two Chinese police officers then went ashore, intending to take the boatman away. The British police explained to them the reasons why they could not allow them to arrest the boatman, and asked them to go to the British police station, guaranteeing that if the procedures were proper, the British police authorities would consider it themselves. The two Chinese police officers then returned to the boat and reported the situation to the Japanese. Shortly afterwards, the boat left and nothing more was heard. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) On the eve of the upcoming Tokyo-Tientsin talks, the Japanese here seem to be attempting to blockade the Hai River.

Therefore, the Japanese side intends to impose stricter control on ship traffic. In addition, several incidents have occurred in the past few days, so the Japanese side may blockade the Hai River. Furthermore, the Japanese military spokesman did not mention a word about the shooting of a Chinese sailor yesterday.

<p>Shantou Correspondence: The number of Japanese troops in Shantou is decreasing daily. Japanese warships and aircraft carriers outside the port left Shantou for Fujian on the 3rd. There are two gunboats, two transport ships, three shallow-draft ships, and fifteen or sixteen motorboats in the port, plus rubber boats, armed fishing boats, and small steamships captured in Shantou, totaling over 100 ships. They carry troops and move around every day, sailing from the Xiangzi Bridge in Chaoan, down to Chenghai, around the Huidong Bridge in Shantou, and into the Pengzhou Wharf, Guanbu, and forts on the Tuo River. The Japanese troop movements are very erratic, sometimes advancing towards Fengxi, Fuyang, and Anjie Road. The Chinese forces there, led by the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade, are holding strongholds in Sangpu Mountain, Wuyang Mountain, Guanji, Dajiao, and Jinshi. The Japanese troops moving south from Chaoan have consistently failed to break through both the Chao-Shan Railway and the An-Jie Road lines. Currently, the Japanese troops still rely on steamships to travel back and forth on the Han River tributaries. As for Yunbu, Longhu, and Meixitou, three locations along the Huti Road Zhong Station, they were recaptured by the Chinese army on July 1. On June 30, Japanese motorboats concentrated at the Xiangzi Bridge and attacked Caijiayuan and Dongjin, attempting to attack Chen's position on Han Mountain. All three advances were repelled because there are many bamboo forests on the riverbank, and the Chinese army is hiding in the bamboo forests to protect Han Mountain. Although the city of Chaoan has been abandoned, it is still under the control of the Chinese bamboo pole mountain artillery. The two sides are in a stalemate. In the past, there were five battles for mountain positions, such as Anbu Panlong Mountain, Guanxi Wuyang Mountain, Fengshan below Longhu, Hulu in West Lake of Chao City, and Qingmao Mountain near Fuyang. With the help of Japanese aircraft, heavy artillery formed a fire net to attack, but they still could not cross and suffered unexpected damage. Therefore, the Japanese troops who attacked Jieyang changed their route to advance northward along the Tuo River front. From the 26th, they continuously moved troops from Chaoan to attack Fort Guanbu. The Japanese troops are too few, with only two full regiments (8,000 men). They are composed of various types of troops. The attack on Jieyang began fiercely on June 28. Along the Tuo River tributaries, they used rubber boats to carry troops to advance to Fengkou Quxi. There were ambushes by soldiers and civilians on the shore, intercepting them everywhere, sinking 16 steamships and rubber boats. Because this tributary originates from Jiaomen in Chaoan, drawing Han River water into the Tuo River, the water flow is rapid. The Chinese had previously laid obstacles at the bends of the creek. When the motorboats traveled upstream during high tide, they were blocked by broken boats on the riverbed. With a slight delay, artillery shells from the shore would fly over. The first batch of Japanese soldiers attacking Jieyang was defeated by the Chinese army. Fortunately, shallow-draft gunboats provided artillery cover, and they retreated from Fort City to Guanbu on the morning of the 29th. On the 30th, the White Army attacking Jieyang changed its route from Sangyuan and Xilu to enter Guanbu, forcing Chaoyang Guiyu Chendian, with the intention of entering Puning Liusha, and instead invading Mianhu of Jieyang. The two armies are fiercely fighting at Fort Quxi on the Tuo River front, and Chinese reinforcements are arriving continuously. The Japanese troops have been running east and west, and transferring north and south since the war began on the 21st, sometimes Chenghai, sometimes Guanbu, and it is still the Masaki Detachment, without any new reinforcements.</p>

The offices and warehouses of various foreign firms are surrounded so that not a drop of water can leak through. A notice from the "Shantou Local Maintenance Committee Preparatory Committee" is posted on Yongping Building, signed by "Chairman" Chen Juemin and "Deputy" Yang Jixiang. The old site of the Guangdong Bank, opposite Yongping Building, has been changed to the Japanese Consulate. The Consul General, Takaido Suehiko, and the Deputy Consul, Matsudaira Tadahisa, work there. On the 26th, the British Consul in Shantou and Captain Scott of the British warship HMS Scout visited the building to meet Matsudaira to negotiate the entry and unloading of passengers and cargo by foreign ships, but Matsudaira refused. He only allowed one British ship to enter Shantou each week to carry mail and food to supply foreign residents in Shantou. Other ships, such as those of the Jardine Matheson Line, are not allowed to enter. The British Consul, seeing that the negotiation was ineffective, telegraphed his superiors for instructions. HMS Scout went to Hong Kong on the 28th to meet with Admiral Noble, the Commander-in-Chief, Far East, who had returned to Hong Kong from Singapore, to request instructions on future escort methods. At this time, ships returning to Shantou from Singapore, Siam, and Annam did not enter, but instead went to Hong Kong to unload passengers and cargo. It is said that the price of a large cabin ticket from Hong Kong to Singapore has risen to 250 Hong Kong dollars per ticket. At this time, demand exceeds supply, and it is not easy to buy even if you are willing to pay a high price. Other British ships that usually travel along the coast of South China, such as the Xinhai Gate, Haicheng, Haitan, and Haiyang, docked near the Ludouzhow Lighthouse outside Mayu when passing through Shantou. Before June 26, several ships had entered under the protection of British warships, stopped for four hours and then sailed out, knowing that they could not load or unload passengers or cargo, but they were unwilling to give up the navigation rights of the treaty port, even if they came and went empty. Until recently, no British ships have been seen sailing in again, only British warships dispatching motorboats to pick up Hong Kong mail and deliver it to the British Consulate, which then forwards it to various foreign residents. If British warships were not willing to perform their duties, news between Shantou and the outside world would be completely blocked, with no water leaking through. The city of Shantou is extremely desolate. There are no electric lights or street lights, and there is no postal or telegraph service. The fresh water that is needed every day cannot be obtained. The machinery of the electric light factory was blown into scrap iron on the 21st. The water tower on Zhongma Road was blown down, and the tap water factory at Meixitou was destroyed by artillery fire. At least 20,000 to 30,000 merchants and residents who have not evacuated Shantou still remain. At this time, it is impossible to walk out. There are no boats to pass through to Guanshi or Chenghai. As for the source of fresh water, it is taken from the small river in Zhongshan Park or the Qi Lu well, which has some salty taste. Coolies carry it into the city and sell it along the streets, tasting it first before buying it, at three or four jiao of silver dollars per load. Vegetables, fish, and meat are out of stock. In the villages and stockades outside the city, strong men are guarding the gates, not allowing strangers to approach, and not interacting with Shantou City. Guanshi and Shantou, separated only by a stretch of water, are gazing at each other from afar, becoming a fairy island that can be seen but not reached. Neither side can fly across. The fighting is extremely fierce in Chaojie. The key points along the Chao-Shan Railway are fighting bitterly. The Japanese troops who landed in Dahao have been attacked several times and suffered heavy losses. They are now retreating to Donghu Aotou, building positions based on the terrain, and dare not extend into Guanshi. The Japanese troops who landed at Fort Guanbu were heavily attacked by the Chinese army on July 1. The Japanese troops in Chaoshan number at most 10,000 men. The largest strongholds, such as Shantou, have only 300 to 500 guards. All the foreign residents in Shantou are unwilling to leave. The prosperity of Shantou in the past depended entirely on Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, as almost everyone knows. Now that transportation between Hong Kong and Shantou has been cut off, it has almost become a dead city.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government Poisons the People: Establishes a Charitable Hall to Specially Sell Opium <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The puppet Jiangsu provincial government is poisoning the people in the occupied areas. It originally set up a so-called "Opium Prohibition Bureau" to issue permits and openly allow smoking. Now, the puppet side has changed its methods and set up a separate "Local Opium Addiction Bureau," starting with Suzhou City. It has selected the west entrance of Nanxianzi Alley as the location of the bureau. The puppet bureau chief, Yang Qincheng, will abolish the former "Raw Opium Shops" and set up a "Hongji Charitable Hall" to specially sell opium. "Raw Opium Shops" will be renamed "Retail Shops," and each shop must pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan and a monthly permit fee of 50 yuan. "Selling and Smoking Places" are called "Rehabilitation Places," and the monthly permit fee is 30 yuan, divided into three grades: A, B, and C. Offices are set up in Wuxi and Wujin counties, divided into grades A and B, specializing in the promotion of opium. All smokers must also re-register, with grade A costing 5 yuan per quarter, allowing them to smoke freely at home. Grade B costs 3 yuan per quarter, and they are only allowed to go to "Rehabilitation Places" to smoke with a permit. The whimsical ideas of the puppet side are evident.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Chen Lifu Tells Haitong News Agency: China Strives for Education; More Than Half of Schools Destroyed; Rebuilding in the Inland Provinces <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing, Haitong News Agency, 11th) Chen Lifu, the Minister of Education of China, met with Mr. Mezze, the Far East General Manager of Haitong News Agency, yesterday and made a statement, declaring that more than half of China's universities and other schools have been destroyed in this decisive battle, but they are now being rebuilt in the inland provinces. All facilities are being expanded rapidly. Fortunately, the valuable books in the libraries of Wuhan and Central Universities have been preserved, but the loss of laboratory equipment is great. Among them, the scientific equipment of Tongji University, which was jointly run by China and Germany, has been completely lost. Chen continued to say that previously, China's academic institutions were only concentrated in some coastal areas, but now efforts are being made to distribute them throughout the country. However, due to the difficulty of construction funding, progress is quite difficult. The government has decided to keep some universities in the interior even after the war ends, so that the people in the interior have equal opportunities to learn. Because engineers and scientists will be urgently needed for post-war construction, it is hoped that foreign German scientists will be allowed to come to China to teach in order to promote China's construction work. Chen praised Germany's scholarship for Chinese students, saying that it has been of great benefit to Chinese students in their studies. Chen stated that this war is an excellent education for China, proving what is truly needed and what is still lacking.</p>
<p>Now, it is actively improving according to this result in order to adapt to future needs. Chen continued to discuss the importance of mass education, saying that schools are the focus of political training in nearby areas. In addition, mobile lecture teams traveling across the country by car and boat, as well as films, phonograph records, and broadcast speeches, are used to improve the educational level of the general public. Finally, Chen expressed the hope that China and Germany will continue to cooperate culturally, sending German teachers to China to assist in cultural undertakings, so as to promote the welfare of the two countries.</p>

<p>Ms. Jiang Yushuang, Principal of Chengdu Xiehe Women's Normal School, after returning to China from Europe, plans to establish a model kindergarten and nursery. The plan has been drawn up and will be implemented soon. The school's student production movement uses spare time to manufacture children's toys, and the proceeds are used as contributions to save the country. The number of students in the school's affiliated primary school and kindergarten has increased. Recently, it plans to raise funds to build a new school building in order to accommodate poor and war-torn children from the war zone in Sichuan.</p>
<p>Huaying Girls' High School has merged its senior and junior high schools this term, personnel have been adjusted, and all facilities have been completely renewed. There are 230 students in the whole school, including more than 30 visiting students, mostly from various war zones or nearby war zones. In addition to focusing on classroom teaching, the school has achieved many results in providing extracurricular knowledge and various activities, such as donating money to comfort the soldiers on the front line and sewing winter clothes.

The school presented him with a retirement fee of 3,000 yuan, and Huada hired him as an honorary director. Wu Xianyou has been publicly elected to act as the principal. The school believes that the number of students in the English and mathematics classes is large, and the teachers cannot supervise the students' writing practice. This term, the English and mathematics classes have been separated in order for the teachers to focus their energy. The implementation of the tutor system is also being carried out with great effort.</p>
<p>The private Huamei Girls' High School has been established for 40 years. Since the war, the number of students from the war zone in Sichuan has increased, and classes have been added, increasing to more than 200 students. Because the school buildings are insufficient, it has negotiated with the board of directors to raise funds to expand the school buildings. This year's summer vacation, classrooms will be added and student dormitories will be purchased. The classroom has been completed, and the dormitory is under construction. This term, the school is divided into nine classes, with 280 students. Students transferred from the war zone account for one-third. The special matters that are particularly emphasized this term are (1) improving moral education and piloting the tutor system, (2) paying special attention to student health, (3) paying attention to scout training, (4) student extracurricular activities, and (5) conducting special education training.</p>

<h3 id="e50">New Remittance Drafts Circulate in the Market - Overall Financial Situation Stabilized - Bank Deposit and Withdrawal Panic Subsides - Increased Capital Enables Banks to Resume Lending <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting deposits and withdrawals, speculative transactions in the Shanghai market have been curtailed and sharply reduced. The banking and money industries have implemented new remittance drafts, adjusted old remittance drafts, and increased the circulation of capital in the market. Therefore, as the 28th year began, the overall financial situation has stabilized. The various situations are described in detail below.</p>
<p>Restriction of Deposit and Withdrawal Panic Subsides</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance's telegram arrived in Shanghai, the banking and money industries unanimously complied with the implementation of deposit and withdrawal restrictions. Depositors and speculators who did not understand the truth rushed to withdraw deposits from various banks. Therefore, the deposit and withdrawal panic in Chinese banks continued to occur. Although the limit was 500 yuan per household per week, the cumulative amount was considerable. Since the banks and money houses reopened after the half-year settlement holiday, the market sentiment has gradually stabilized. Daily payments by various banks have been able to balance out, and some banks and money houses have even experienced more deposits than payments. Therefore, the deposit and withdrawal panic has subsided.</p>
<p>Increased Circulation of Capital in the Market</p>
<p>The new remittance draft system implemented by the banking and money industries has been circulating in the market since the banks and money houses began to receive them from the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks on the 4th of this month. Although the total amount is temporarily set at 50 million yuan, the full amount has not yet been received, and the capital position is quite abundant. At the same time, the 22 million yuan in old remittance drafts deposited by the banks and money houses in the Joint Reserve Treasury of the banking and money industries has also been converted by the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks into legal currency current accounts. Starting in April, the banks and money houses will receive legal currency to meet depositors' withdrawals. The market capital has become much more active after this adjustment.</p>
<p>Contraction of Cash and Reduced Speculation</p>
<p>In order to prevent capital outflow and stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the Ministry of Finance has specifically stipulated deposit payment methods, implemented deposit and withdrawal restrictions, contracted the cash in the market, and eliminated speculation such as absorbing legal currency and purchasing foreign exchange. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable results. The foreign exchange, cash, cotton yarn, and bean and rice markets have all suffered from a lack of cash, soaring remittance discounts, and speculators have been unable to do as they pleased as before. Although it has not been possible to completely eliminate speculative activities, transactions have been sharply reduced.</p>
<p>Overall Financial Situation Tends to Stabilize</p>
<p>Since the foreign exchange fluctuations, followed by the Ministry of Finance's deposit and withdrawal restrictions, the Shanghai financial market suddenly turned tight, and credit transactions stagnated. Subsequently, the banking and money industries discussed and decided on measures to stabilize the market, adjust remittance drafts and bills, implement the new remittance draft system, increase the circulation of capital, adjust interbank funds, and assist industry and commerce. Although the time has been short since its implementation, the overall financial situation has tended to stabilize. Various banks and money houses have also resumed mortgage credit and various loans to industry and commerce, and are accepting applications within the possible scope.</p>
<p>Bill Exchange Time Changed</p>
<p>Since the concentration of bill exchange by the banking and money industries on July 4, the time for banks to receive bills from money houses was too late, causing various difficulties in the work. Pei Yunqing, a leader in the money industry, once proposed improvements and suggested to the guild. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency inquired from the banking and money industries yesterday and learned that the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks and the Joint Reserve Treasury of the money industry had agreed and announced yesterday that it would be implemented from the 12th. The announcement is recorded below. "Respectfully inform you that since this treasury joined the bill exchange in a entrusted manner, the time for banks to receive bills from money houses has been too late, causing various difficulties in the work. It has now been agreed by the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks to move the bill exchange time forward by half an hour (3:00 PM) starting from the 12th of this month. Afterwards, all bank bills from various houses should also be delivered to this treasury half an hour earlier (2:00 PM). After 2:00 PM, please pay directly to the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks.

<p>In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, domestic port shipping is freely controlled by the Japanese, and after increasing the number of ships sailing to various ports, the guerrillas in various ports have been appearing and attacking unpredictably, posing a significant blow. According to a reporter from Xinxin News Agency, on the evening of the 9th, a Chinese mobile force suddenly attacked Tianshenggang, burning down the local tax revenue office. After completing the mission, they withdrew. The ship schedule has now been suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Hozdeng City Ship Loses, Returns to Shanghai From Danger - Master Mariner Steadfast and Outstanding - Refuses Japanese Rescue <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese-language Shanghai newspaper North-China Daily News reports that the ten-thousand-ton motor ship Hozdeng City, after running aground on Jeju Island in heavy fog last week, has now entered the dry dock of the Yangshupu Wharf. The bottom below the waterline has been severely damaged. The ship left Shanghai on July 3 for L興 (transliteration) in northern Korea to transport beans to the UK. While sailing near Jeju Island off the southern coast of Korea, it suddenly encountered dense fog and ran aground. A Japanese surveyor on the island immediately boarded the ship, intending to provide assistance. However, the Master Mariner of the Hozdeng City refused all rescue suggestions, stating that he would use the ship's own power to refloat it. Although the surveyor stated that this was impossible, the Master Mariner insisted and eventually succeeded in refloating the ship and sailing it to Shanghai. The weather was clear all the way, and it arrived in Shanghai without any further misfortunes. It has not yet been decided whether the ship will be repaired here. This matter will be decided by insurers in London. The ship was built in 1924 and belongs to William Reardon Smith &amp; Sons, Ltd. of Cardiff, UK.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Three British Factories Along the Riverbank Are Cut Off by the Japanese Army - Barbed Wire Fences Erected Along the Suzhou Creek Disrupting Traffic - British Consulate Lodges Protest with the Japanese <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese-language Shanghai newspaper North-China Daily News reports that after the three British commercial factories located along the north bank of the Suzhou Creek in Kaibei were cut off by the erection of barbed wire fences by the Japanese military authorities yesterday (the 10th), the British Consulate has lodged a protest, opposing the Japanese ban on anyone reaching the riverbank wharves of the three factories. After the Japanese took this action, Liaison Officer Hunter immediately began negotiations, stating that this action would cause difficulties, as the trade of the three factories mostly originated from the wharves along the river, and now the wharves were blocked by barbed wire fences. The three factories are the China General Edison Company, as well as the Chongxin and Zhentai cotton mills, all of which are British-owned. The three companies complained to the British authorities yesterday about the Japanese action, stating that unless the obstacles were removed, their trade would suffer significant losses as a result, as their trade relied heavily on the Suzhou Creek. The China General Edison Company, which manufactures heavy items such as trams, was the most affected by the Japanese action. All of the company's manufactured goods were loaded onto boats at the Suzhou Creek wharf, and the employees of the three companies also took sampans from the Public Concession across the river to enter the factory. As a result of this Japanese action, the only channel into the three factories was through a bridge guarded by Japanese soldiers. The cotton mill employees, mostly women, would strongly object to crossing the bridge to enter the factory, as those crossing the bridge were all subjected to Japanese soldier inspections. According to the Japanese military authorities, erecting barbed wire fences to cut off the cotton mills was part of a general plan to isolate the entire north bank of the Suzhou Creek with barbed wire fences in order to prevent undesirable elements from sneaking into the western district of the Public Concession. According to the Japanese, these undesirable elements crossed the river to enter. The Japanese also stated that there was absolutely no question of discrimination because the three factories were British-owned, but that the isolation was due to the fact that these properties were located on the north bank of the river. The China General Edison Company and the Chongxin Cotton Mill are currently in operation, but the Zhentai Cotton Mill has not yet started operations because the Japanese did not recognize its British ownership and prevented it from resuming work after the Shanghai war. After lengthy negotiations, the Zhentai Cotton Mill was handed over to its original owner in May and left under the care of people, and its machinery and buildings have been repaired in preparation for starting operations. The three factories all face the Italian military defense zone on the outer roads of the western district of the Public Concession.</p>

<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the American warship Henderson arrived today (the 11th), two days later than scheduled. The ship will carry Marine Corps soldiers whose term of service in China has expired and will sail back to the United States on the 21st of this month.

<p>The Chinese-language Shanghai newspaper North-China Daily News reports that it learned yesterday (the 10th) from official naval circles that Rear Admiral Hart is scheduled to replace Admiral Yarnell as Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet in Shanghai on July 25. Rear Admiral Hart is currently aboard the President Coolidge and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on July 19. The flagship of the US Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, carrying Admiral Yarnell, is scheduled to arrive here on July 18 and will be berthed at the head of the line of warships in the Huangpu River. Admiral Yarnell has scheduled July 25 as the day of the handover. On that day, a ceremony will be held on the aft deck of the flagship. Admiral Yarnell will read his orders and hand over the command of the fleet to Rear Admiral Hart. Rear Admiral Hart will then read his orders in front of the officers and men of the flagship, stating that he has taken over as Commander-in-Chief. Then Admiral Yarnell's flag will be lowered and replaced with Rear Admiral Hart's flag. Rear Admiral Hart will be promoted to full admiral immediately after taking office as Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet. There are only four full admirals in the US Navy. The other three admirals are the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commander-in-Chief of the US Fleet, and the Commander of the Battle Force of the US Fleet. It is learned that Rear Admiral Hart is coming to Shanghai from Washington, where he was the Chairman of the General Board of the Navy. He recently relinquished his position. Rear Admiral Hart was born in Davison, Michigan, on June 12, 1897. He graduated from the US Naval Academy and the Naval and Army War Colleges. He was promoted to Rear Admiral in 1929 and served as Superintendent of the US Naval Academy from 1931 until he relinquished his position in 1935. Admiral Yarnell is scheduled to leave Shanghai on August 1 aboard the President Coolidge.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Despite Zhejiang Coast Blockade - Sales Unaffected - Trade Commission Issues Tea Funds of 450,000 Yuan to Various Counties <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial War Zone Products Transportation and Sales Office recently released the following information on the province's recent product transportation and sales situation. (1) The problem of tea procurement. The procurement of tea in Zhejiang Province this year was originally entrusted by the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission to the provincial government. Later, because the China Tea Company presented to the central government for approval to purchase tea in Zhejiang, the China Tea Company and the Products Transportation and Sales Office are now purchasing tea at the same time. However, the autumn tea starting in the second half of the year may be purchased solely by the company. (2) The problem of future product exports. Even if the Zhejiang sea coast is completely blockaded in the future and there are difficulties in exporting special products, it will not be a problem because the central government has already paid attention to planning early on. The intermodal transport by water and land between Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces is becoming increasingly developed, and the transportation and sales of Zhejiang's special products will not be hindered. This is clearly visible. (3) The problem of tea funds in various counties. The Trade Commission has now allocated 450,000 yuan, which will be transferred by the Products Transportation and Sales Office to various counties.</p>

The rumor that the police are not allowing rickshaws to raise their canopies on sunny days is absolutely untrue.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Hongkou is the Center for Pirated Books - Great Losses for Chinese Merchants - Textbooks for Large, Medium, and Small Schools Included - Content Altered and Covers Also Changed <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese-language newspaper Continental Daily News reports that in Hongkou and other parts of the Japanese-occupied area, the piracy of books is also rampant. The victims are not foreign publishers, but Chinese commercial firms in this city. Those engaged in this business appear to have the permission and encouragement of the Japanese authorities and are currently reprinting thousands of books whose copyrights are exclusively owned by well-known publishing companies in this city. This information was provided by reliable sources, and those who provided this information have suffered huge losses in the printing and publishing business since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. It is said that the headquarters of the pirated books in Hongkou is located at the World Book Bureau Printing Factory at 130 Dalian Bay Road, named Huazhong Printing Company. The World Book Bureau Printing Factory was one of the few Chinese large commercial firms that did not move its machinery and inventory out of the war zone during the military uprising the year before last. Tens of millions of books stored in the warehouses of the book bureau were confiscated by the Japanese, and the Japanese army and navy authorities used the building as a headquarters. More than tens of millions of textbooks were confiscated and transported to Japan. Several million copies have been retained here as originals for reprinting. A certain bookseller in the Public Concession has collected these pirated books and showed them to reporters yesterday (the 10th). All kinds of books used in large, medium, and small schools, such as revised Chinese and English textbooks, have been reprinted by this new company in Hongkou. The content has been modified, and the names of the publishers have also been changed. Many scientific books among the pirated books have not been changed from the original, except that the covers are no longer the same. According to the bookseller who collected these books, the reason for confiscating books owned by Chinese people was that they were anti-Japanese. If that is the case, why are the Japanese themselves reprinting and selling them today? This is really no different from robbery.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Resuming the Joint Venture Plan - Japanese Monopoly on the Match Industry - The So-Called "General Office" is Established in Tianjin - Shanghai "Branch Office" Operates in the Enterprise Building - Participants Include as Many as Twenty-Two Companies <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The "China National Match Joint Venture", a Sino-Japanese joint venture before the war, is now being revived, and the "Shanghai Branch" will open soon. Details are explored below.</p>
<p>Shanghai Branch Established</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the "National Joint Venture" was established in Shanghai by Sino-Japanese manufacturers in a joint venture, but it only appeared briefly before fading into obscurity. Now that the Japanese side is gradually expanding the occupied areas in an attempt to control the Chinese economy to achieve its aggressive ambitions, it is implementing controls separately, and the Chinese match industry is also being coveted. It is heard that under the direction of the Japanese authorities, in addition to establishing the "China National Match Joint Venture General Office" in Tianjin, a "Branch Office" has recently been established in Shanghai. The Japanese Mr. Sawada serves as the chairman, and the representatives of the Chinese factories are merely appendages of the company, with no rights or interests to speak of.</p>
<p>Participating Factories</p>
<p>According to sources in the match industry, the Chinese manufacturers participating in the company include Shanghai Ying, Zhen Ying, Zhonghua, Guanghua, Hong Sheng, Yu Sheng, Zhengda, Tong Sui, Chu Sheng, Zhongguo, Dahua, Huai Shang, Daming, Minsheng, Sui Chang, Guangming, Zhongnan, Jiangbei, Ganxing, Hefeng, Bianmin, Meiguo, and twenty-two others. Each is assigned one to two, three, or four "representatives" to the company. However, most of the above factories have been forcibly occupied and put into operation by the Japanese, so they are actually no different from Japanese businesses.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Open</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Branch" is currently located on the fifth floor of the Enterprise Building at 33 Sichuan Road. Preparations are already in place. When a reporter from the Daguan News Agency visited the company yesterday, as Chinese merchants were participating, they saw Chinese and Japanese people together in high spirits and busy with cooperative work. They refused to meet with visitors and refused to reveal any information. Later, it was learned from relevant sources that the company will open around the 15th of this month. In the future, the business of various Chinese factories will be controlled by the Japanese, and the conspiracy of economic plunder will be actively implemented. It is heard that many manufacturers are aware of the overall situation and are willing to sacrifice themselves, vowing not to cooperate with them.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Foreign Banks Control Black Market Exchange Rates, Stabilization Committee Exerts Effort to Stabilize Exchange Rates, Authorizes HSBC to Restrict Swap Transactions <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued regulations for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods, and established a Foreign Exchange Examination Committee in Chongqing, businesses wishing to apply must request it from the committee. However, legal foreign exchange is not granted for goods transported to occupied areas. Therefore, goods transported to Shanghai, whether necessities or luxury goods, must still purchase foreign exchange on the Shanghai black market. The Shanghai black market exchange rate is still maintained by the British-owned HSBC Bank. The bank's listed rates are kept at a horizontal level, namely six and a half pence for the British pound and 12.625 yuan for the US dollar. However, to prevent speculators from manipulating the market, foreign exchange swaps are restricted. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee still adheres to its established policy of exerting effort to stabilize foreign exchange prices and maintains the Shanghai black market. It also cooperates with the British-owned HSBC and Mercantile Banks. Therefore, the decision to restrict foreign exchange swaps is said to have been authorized by the committee to HSBC. Although the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has been ordered to cease processing applications for legal foreign exchange from various businesses, it still publishes the legal foreign exchange rates daily, namely two shillings and a half pence for the British pound and 30 US dollars. From now on, legal foreign exchange for the import of necessities will be subject to review by the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee, which will designate the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to handle it. However, the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications do not handle applications for foreign exchange from various businesses because Shanghai is an occupied area. The import of foreign goods into Shanghai will inevitably be unable to obtain legal foreign exchange and must purchase it on the black market. However, the black market is controlled by foreign banks and already has a standard exchange rate as a blueprint. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee continues to perform its function of balancing exchange rates, making it difficult for speculators and those attempting to profit from foreign exchange purchases to do as they please. Therefore, the foreign exchange market is unlikely to undergo any significant changes.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Commemorative Stamps Celebrating American Independence Acquired by Shanghai Philatelists, Embellished with Chinese and American Flags and a Map of the Republic of China, Banned in Occupied Areas, Not Sold in Shanghai <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts issued commemorative stamps celebrating the 150th anniversary of American independence. These stamps were discovered in Shanghai yesterday, purchased by philatelists from Chongqing. However, the Shanghai post office has not yet received them and there is no prospect of them being sold, making them particularly valuable.</p>
<p>Stamp Design</p>
<p>The commemorative stamps for the 150th anniversary of American independence issued by the Directorate General of Posts were printed by the American Bank Note Company. The complete set consists of four types, each 39 cm high and 54 cm wide. The words "Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of American Independence" are printed on them in a horizontal arrangement. In the upper left corner, the national flag of the Republic of China (Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth) is printed, and in the lower corner, the American flag is printed. In the center is a map of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Colors and Values</p>
<p>The commemorative stamps are divided into four colors according to their value: the five-cent stamp is green, the 25-cent stamp is blue, the 50-cent stamp is brown, and the one-yuan stamp is pink. The Chinese and American flags are printed in their original colors, making them vivid and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Not Issued in Shanghai</p>
<p>These stamps were printed by the American Bank Note Company. The first batch was printed and sold by the Kunming Postal Administration. However, each purchase was accompanied by a small English envelope containing a Chinese translation with the following serious words: "We advise you not to use these stamps on mail sent to occupied areas." From the above wording, it is unlikely that the Shanghai post office will be able to sell these commemorative stamps. A photograph of this valuable commemorative stamp is reproduced above.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Remembering Mr. Qin Runqing, a Veteran of the Money Shop Industry (Part 2) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>Mr. Qin began by recounting a brief history of the rise and fall of the Shanghai money shop industry. He said: Before the Taiping Rebellion, the most developed area for money shops in Shanghai was in the Nanshi (South City) because at that time, ships from other ports were all sailing vessels and docked near the 16th Pier, so merchants gathered in this area. Later, when the Taiping army entered Southeast China, Shanghai became a region where floating capital concentrated. By the middle of the Guangxu era, there were 40 money shops in Nanshi and 50 in Beishi (North City) in Shanghai, but their business scope was also limited. The total annual receipts and payments of each shop were less than one million taels of silver. Because interest rates were higher and expenses were lower at that time, most of them had surpluses. Taking salaries at the time as an example, the manager of a money shop earned no more than 200 or 300 yuan per year, and ordinary employees earned 10 yuan or tens of yuan per year. After the Sino-Japanese War and the Boxer Rebellion, the money shop industry began to decline. In the early years of the Xuantong era, it was affected by the rubber stock craze, followed by the Revolution of 1911, and the number of money shops in Shanghai Beishi was reduced by half. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the period around 1922 and 1923 was the most developed period for the money shop industry. After 1927, banks gradually increased, and the money shop industry found it difficult to develop due to several changes. In 1935, the government implemented the silver policy, and the money shop industry felt increasingly inferior due to the mortgage of real estate. Now, the money shop industry itself can ensure credit and consolidate business, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Mr. Qin continued to talk about the future of the money shop industry. He firmly believed that the money shop industry would never fail. The reason is that the money shop industry has a history of more than 100 years and has always regarded credit lending as its main business. When the funds of various industries are insufficient, they mostly rely on money shops to adjust. Over the past 100 years, there have been many cases of industries and businesses with small amounts of capital achieving great scale. If they unfortunately fail in business, the money shop is determined to help as much as possible, and it is common to see them revive and restore their former glory. China's economic organization is immature and backward, which is undeniable. All industries rely on credit loans to inject funds. Therefore, in terms of China's industrial and commercial economic situation, the business operated by money shops still has great prospects.</p>
<p>Based on his successful history and experience in running the money shop industry, he believed that if money shops concentrate on their business efforts, they will never suffer setbacks. The reason for their setbacks is all due to personal relationships, or excessive lending, or individuals running other businesses concurrently. Because they are affected by unpredictable influences, the money shop is also affected. Even if an employee concentrates on his job and thinks about the interests of the business everywhere, unexpected setbacks will never occur. His conclusion is that if you don't seek personal gain, you won't fail. This is true for individuals and for businesses. This is truly a matter of experience and cannot be erased.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Qin expressed his sincere love, concern, and encouragement to this newspaper. He said: "I love to read the Shen Bao. I hope that the Shen Bao can provide more materials needed by the general public and provide guidance."</p>

<h3 id="e66">A Visit to the New Java Liner "Tjitjalengka" <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Xing</p>
<p>Anyone who pays a little attention to European and American liners knows the names of several shipping companies, such as Lloyd Triestino, British India, Norddeutscher Lloyd, President Lines, and China Merchants. This is because these liners have a large tonnage and luxurious facilities, and have a reputation as "sea palaces," which is undeniable. In fact, the Java Line is the closest to the Chinese people and has the most Chinese passengers.</p>
<p>The Java Line's routes are in the area of the South Seas Islands. Its first route is from Shanghai via Xiamen, Hong Kong, Little Luzon, Cebu, Manado, Makassar, Bali to Surabaya. The second route is from Shanghai via Xiamen, Hong Kong, Wen Island, Batavia, Cirebon, Semarang to Surabaya.</p>
<p>We may still be a little unfamiliar with the names of these South Seas Islands, but we must not ignore that these places are where overseas Chinese work hard and struggle to survive. It can be said that today's brilliant South Seas were built by overseas Chinese. The Java Company's liners sail year-round to places where overseas Chinese live. Every year, tens of millions of overseas Chinese travel from Xiamen to the South Seas or from the South Seas back to Xiamen, all on Java ships.</p>
<p>The Java Line has several ships, such as the "Tjinegara," "Tjisadane," "Tjisaroa," "Tjibadak," and "Tjisalak," which have a large tonnage and very comfortable facilities. In particular, they are suitable for Chinese customs. The layout of the restaurant is like the Xing Hua Lou in Shanghai, with round mahogany tables and long sleeping chairs, fully expressing the flavor of South China. When overseas Chinese board the ship, they seem to be at home.</p>
<p>Now, the Java Company has a new ship making its maiden voyage to Shanghai. The ship is named "M.S. Tjitjalengka," built by the Netherlands Shipbuilding Company, with a gross tonnage of 17,150 tons, a horsepower of 6,000, a speed of 15 nautical miles per hour, a length of 474 feet and 10 inches, and a width of 64 feet and 6 inches. The depth from the deck to the bottom of the cabin is 38 feet and 6 inches, the draft is 28 feet and 9 inches, and the cargo tonnage is 9,930 tons. It can carry 1,420 passengers, 64 in first class (each with its own bathroom), 55 in second class, 100 in third class, and 1,200 in steerage. This new liner is more advanced and perfect in style and facilities than the "Tjisadane." It has a sports field, swimming pool, radio station, library, hospital, pharmacy, and other facilities such as a social room, smoking room, barber shop, and bar. There is also a glass-enclosed walkway on the deck for rainy days. The lighting is beautifully arranged, and the heating and cooling equipment is suitable. Each cabin is equipped with a radio, which broadcasts various music and current events reports at any time. The kitchen and food storage room also have special equipment that can make the food fresh and delicious.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, several of us were invited by the Java Company to visit this new liner on its maiden voyage to Shanghai. The small boat departed from the Custom House Wharf. The "Scott No. 1" tugboat was crowded with many visitors. The large number of people was truly beyond our expectations. After more than 20 minutes, we arrived at the new "Tjitjalengka."</p>
<p>When we boarded the ship, we felt a sense of brightness in front of us, like a new house. What was placed in front of us were all happy and "new" decorations, and everyone was filled with a sense of joy. We looked at the first-class cabin to the upper deck, to the bow and stern, to our heart's content. After 6 o'clock, we took the original tugboat back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>In the evening, the Java Company hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel to entertain guests from all walks of life. The event was hosted by the manager Mr. Ge Li Ai, the Chinese manager Qian Chongfu, and important staff members Chen Shide and Zhu Shoupeng. There were more than 800 Chinese and foreign guests, and the sound of joy lasted until late at night.</p>
<p>The Magnificent Appearance of the "Tjitjalengka"</p>
<h3 id="e67">Rice Market Supplies Increased Greatly in the Last Two Days, About 10,000 Bags Arrived Daily, Sales Were Sluggish, Hoping the Authorities Would Set Price Limits Again During This Period <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The rice in the Shanghai market comes from Songjiang, Minhang, Tongli, Pingwang, Luxu, Zhu Jing, Qingpu, Zhangyan, Ba Chi, Zhu Jiajiao, and Zhejiang in Jiangsu Province, which is called the South Gang. Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, Wujin, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Yixing, etc. are called the North Gang rice. Those who come from Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei are called Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei rice, and are divided into glutinous and indica rice. New rice from various places will be launched soon, with the new japonica rice from Pudong being the earliest, around early August. Jiaxing's Yangjian and Wuhu's Indica rice will be available in mid-August, while Du rice will be available around the end of August. However, the late rice will be fully available before the end of September.</p>
<p>More Arrivals Than Sales, Supply Exceeds Demand</p>
<p>The price of domestic rice has recently shifted from stable to declining due to the gradual increase in arrivals. Inland river transportation has also gradually recovered, and the number of arrivals from the river has increased. Rice boats that were blocked in the Songjiang area have been released and have arrived in Shanghai one after another, greatly increasing the supply. On the 10th, arrivals from various places included eight or nine ships from the river, more than ten trucks by train, and five or six thousand bags by sea, totaling more than ten thousand bags. On the 11th, there were also seven or eight thousand bags. However, due to (1) the hot weather is not suitable for hoarding, (2) the lack of cash, (3) rice shops and hoarders are trying to sell their goods on the market, and (4) arrivals are sold on the market, the market sales are sluggish, and the supply exceeds demand, causing the rice price to fall sharply, returning to within the price limit. The average decline is about three or five corners. This proves that although the rice stored in each rice warehouse has been reduced to 399,902 bags, there is a lot of rice stored in each rice store and by citizens, which is enough for three months. Therefore, the transactions at each rice shop have shifted to negotiation.

<p>Imported Rice to Arrive at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Saigon imported rice commissioned by the Shanghai Grain Merchants Association from Da Fu Foreign Company, totaling 600 tons, has been loaded and shipped and is expected to arrive at the end of this month. It is reported that Saigon rice is divided into three types: Fa Luo, Ge Kun, and Bai Sai. The rice ordered this time is Ge Kun rice, produced in Ge Kun, which is round and firm, with excellent quality, and is a superior rice. The price of each bag of the imported rice, which is one stone and two and a half buckets, is 21 yuan, and it is imported tax-free. However, after arriving in Shanghai, due to the decline in the price of domestic rice in Shanghai, it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain a large profit.</p>

<p>The disaster in Jiangxi Province has been extremely serious, with hundreds of thousands of people displaced, without clothing or food. At this time of extreme heat, there is a risk of disease and increased mortality everywhere. Jiangxi natives here have received Jiangxi letters one after another and are very anxious. Therefore, a Jiangxi Natives in Shanghai Jiangxi Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee was organized a few days ago. Hu Siyi, Yu Jiancheng, Qi Litang, Li Hanqing, Zhu Chi Yang, Dai Yuheng, Hui Shimei, and other seven people were elected as standing committee members. The Yumin Bank on Ningbo Road was used as the meeting place, and fundraising was actively carried out. In a few days, they plan to appeal to various groups and people from all walks of life in the city, requesting donations to save them.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Check Number Error, Cash Out Deposit, Obviously Embezzled, Original Account Found Error, Person in Charge Detained for Investigation <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>On March 31st of this year, the Yongxin Hemp Weaving Company at No. 406 Jiangxi Road had a current account with the China Reclamation Bank at the intersection of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road, with 100 yuan in legal tender. The bank filled out a checkbook with account number 6641. Soon, the company suddenly stated that it would cancel the account and return the checkbook. The China Reclamation Bank then returned the deposited funds and canceled the registration. Until the day before yesterday, Ge Yanqing, account number 6755 of the bank, issued a check to withdraw 300 yuan from the China Reclamation Bank. However, after the bank staff checked, Ge had withdrawn 300 yuan on July 4th, and the current balance was less than 300 yuan, so they refused to pay. However, Ge stated that she had not recently withdrawn any funds from the bank, so she negotiated with the bank. After a detailed investigation by the bank, the check for 300 yuan withdrawn on July 4th was found to have the check number 3511170, which was previously issued to Yongxin Company, account number 6641. Furthermore, the account number on the check, 6641, had been涂off, and the account number 6755 of the depositor was added to it. Obviously, someone was embezzling deposits from others. Therefore, Manager Wang Boyuan reported to the General Patrol Room. Detective Yang Peisheng and detective Qian Xianting rushed to investigate and believed that Zhou Liankui, a Ningbo native (residing at No. 476, Beisuzhou Road) and a staff member of the cashier department of the bank, was the person in charge of this matter and was suspected of embezzlement. He was detained and taken back to the police station. However, Zhou confessed. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the first criminal court of the Special First District Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested that Zhou be temporarily detained pending investigation on the grounds that the case still needed to be investigated in detail. After Judge Feng Shide approved the report, he ordered that he be returned to custody and the hearing be rescheduled for one week.</p>

<p>Li Mingzhi, the owner of Wanbao Silk Factory at No. 53 Singapore Road, received a letter at about 10 a.m. on the 10th, falsely claiming to be the Iron Blood Eradication Troupe, saying that you are really a traitorous merchant, and our brothers lack food and pay, so we are lending at least 600 yuan in legal tender. A person must be sent after 8 p.m., wearing a western suit and holding an umbrella as a symbol, to send the above-mentioned military pay, wrapped in paper, to the vicinity of the Golden Grand Theater in Ba Xian Bridge, French Concession, and wait for someone to contact you, otherwise your life will be difficult to protect.</p>
<p>The words were fierce. After receiving the letter, factory owner Li was very frightened and reported the letter to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detective Wang Cheng Ying ordered the factory staff surnamed Pan to dress in a western suit and leather shoes, holding an umbrella, and wrap the newspaper in the appearance of 600 yuan in legal tender. At that time, Detective Wang, along with detectives Lu Gen Di and Xu Gui Rong, detectives Xia Shutang, Bu Zongding, Bai Wenqi, Chen Shanji, and Western detective Yue Tailai, accompanied Representative Pan.</p>
<p>They first went to the vicinity of the Golden Grand Theater and lingered, while Detective Wang and Detective Xia dressed as merchants and stood at the entrance of the theater to observe the situation. After a while, a 14-year-old boy from Siyang came slowly from the Gongguan Road in the French Concession, saw Representative Pan, and asked, "Are you sent by our silk factory to deliver the money?" (The answer was yes). He then asked him to follow him to Gongguan Road. Detective Wang and Detective Xia followed closely.</p>
<p>When they arrived near a large cake stall at No. 35 Xiafei Road, Gong Enyue, an 18-year-old Tianjin native, suddenly walked out of the stall, holding a wooden stick, and without asking why, threw the paper bag containing 600 yuan of legal tender at the head of Representative Pan. At this time, Detective Wang and Detective Xia, along with the Western detective Yue Tailai and the Chinese detectives, surrounded Meng Gong and the cake stall and arrested them, including the stall owner, Cun Tang, a 42-year-old Siyang native.</p>
<p>They were taken back to the police station for detention and escorted to the third criminal court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 446, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law for attempted extortion by intimidation and stated that there was still one principal offender at large in the case. Since the victim Li Mingzhi has not arrived, please detain the defendants pending further investigation, etc. Then, Representative Pan testified to the course of events. The three defendants were questioned, and their confessions were ambiguous. Judge Huang Ri Jie ordered that they be returned to custody and the hearing be rescheduled.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Letter <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Madam Sun Zhu Ruizhen, who claims that the reports in the Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, and Shibao on July 8 regarding her lawsuit against Jiang Guopei for a loan were largely inaccurate and should be corrected. According to Madam Sun, although her husband, Sun Shaoqing, was prosecuted by the police for suspected barratry, the case was remanded for retrial by the Supreme Court. Subsequently, due to Mr. Sun's death, the case was dismissed by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Therefore, Mr. Sun's crime of barratry was not confirmed, and it is inappropriate for the Shen Bao and Shibao to refer to him as the "famous barrator Sun Shaoqing." As for the loan case against Jiang Guopei, it was indeed a cash loan initially. Witnesses Zhao Zelin and lawyer Li Gengxiang both stated that they had asked Jiang Guopei at the time, and he confirmed that the money had been received in full, as evidenced by court transcripts. Jiang Guopei obtained the deed of conveyance because he entrusted Zhao Zelin to negotiate with Madam Sun to obtain it for applying for a certificate of administration of inheritance. Furthermore, Jiang Guopei personally issued a receipt as proof. If Madam Sun had returned the deed of conveyance out of fear that Jiang Guopei would report her, why would Jiang Guopei have issued a receipt? The above points are significantly different from the newspaper reports and should be corrected separately. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e83">A Remarkable Story in the Scientific World <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>In countries with advanced science in Europe and America, the people are wealthy, and young people have many opportunities to study. However, there are still many poor young people who struggle hard in difficult circumstances. Among those who have achieved great success in science, their spirit of diligence and hard work is worthy of inspiring interest among young people in our country. I will tell one story here, hoping that young people in our country will be encouraged by it. There was a poor student in the United States whose father was a farmer who often worked as a hired laborer. This student was very studious from a young age and was fortunate enough to complete his studies at a secondary school with great difficulty. He wanted to enter university but was troubled by a lack of financial resources. His father gave him all the money he had saved over the years, but it was only seventy-five dollars. He entered the cheapest university, and his tuition fees and books exhausted all his money. So, he worked in a restaurant and got three meals a day. He lived in a basement and took care of the furnace fire and watered the flowers to avoid paying for lodging. He swept each classroom in the school and also worked short hours in various shops and post offices outside the school to earn pocket money. He spent his days in class and at work, with no free time, but because of his hard work and diligence, his academic performance was excellent. In his fourth year, the professor praised his ambition and promoted him to teaching assistant, so he got a better salary and no longer had to do odd jobs. After graduating, he stayed at the school and served as a regular teacher. Only then could he return home to visit his parents, and the money he had left in his pocket was all given to his father, and the amount was exactly seventy-five dollars. The villagers spread this story as a good one. This man later became a famous scientist, served as president of various universities and academic societies, and contributed greatly to promoting advanced research and promoting scientific education. He wrote extensively on specialized science and also wrote extensively on literature, philosophy, education, history, and social sciences. He was a leader in the American scientific community for more than forty years. He traveled to Europe, and universities, research institutes, and other academic institutions in various countries invited him to give lectures hundreds of times. He also advocated world peace and opposed wars of aggression, working for the harmony and happiness of mankind. He can be called a hero and is worthy of emulation by young people in our country. However, schools and society in the United States provide extra help to poor young people, and working part-time while studying is very popular. There are many talented young people in our country who are capable of being made, and I hope that domestic schools and society will pay attention to this point and learn from others' strengths.

<h3 id="e84">Ants: Natural Warriors <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Shang Yao</p>
<p>Nature is cruel, and the history of the animal kingdom is simply a history of struggle. But there are only two kinds of animals in the world that are most accustomed to killing each other. One is humans, and the other is ants.</p>
<p>It's really strange! These two kinds of animals are so different in form, but their social lives and habits are very similar. Ants live in politically enlightened countries, raise livestock, grow food—mostly small fungi—store grain, and build houses. Their buildings are much more advanced than the buildings of primitive humans.</p>
<p>The strangest thing is that ant wars are very similar to human wars. The tactics and strategies of ant armies are probably still considered a model for our military strategists.</p>
<p>In terms of natural weapons, ants are really much stronger than humans. Poor humans have no defensive weapons, and a pair of fists has very limited offensive value. But ants have a set of sturdy armor and a pair of powerful jaws. But these are just their basic weapons; they also have watchmen!</p>
<p>The most terrifying poison gas known in human warfare is mustard gas. Nature also gives ants a very similar weapon. Some ants can shoot a liquid a long distance. If it hits an enemy ant, the poor victim will be unable to move and will soon die. Even larger animals such as spiders and small birds cannot survive if they are exposed to this venom.</p>
<p>Many kinds of ants do not have this terrible weapon and rely entirely on their jaws to break the heads of their enemies, or even tear them to pieces.</p>
<p>The enemy of an ant is any ant in an enemy group, regardless of whether the intruder is of the same species, but there are no traitors in the group. They have a highly developed sense of smell and can distinguish who is a friend and who is an enemy. Once an external aggressor is encountered, the war begins immediately. They will not kneel down and beg for mercy, nor will they make peace midway.</p>
<p>If only a few ants from each side encounter each other, then the team with the smaller number of ants will immediately form a skirmish line and prepare to fight. If large armies face each other, when the fierce battle begins, they will use real tactics, the formation is very complete, and all plans are well thought out and without any mistakes.</p>
<p>The cause of war is either a dispute over territory or the expansion of territory due to an overpopulation of ants. A Swedish scientist once poured a bag of ants near the border of another ant colony, which caused a great war. He described it as follows.</p>
<p>At first, there was no movement because neither side knew where the enemy was. Soon, a few passing ants were accidentally captured by the invaders and immediately executed so that they would not have the opportunity to send an alarm. So, the invading forces immediately advanced. And the defending warriors also occupied advantageous military strongholds in the dense grass to await the enemy's attack.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, the defending army was outnumbered and retreated back to the city. The scientist, who was watching from the sidelines, saw that the ant army in the rear was really panicked, scurrying east and west, and extremely chaotic. At a critical moment, a force of reinforcements arrived unexpectedly.</p>
<p>This large team of reinforcements was ambushed in the city in advance. Now, with the swiftness of lightning, they rushed into the battlefield. After an hour and a half of desperate fighting, the enemy's fierce flames were dampened. Finally, they were defeated and fled in all directions. The ants who fought for self-defense finally won the final victory.</p>
<p>Ants and war are probably like this. But some kinds of ants like to use surprise attacks or surround the enemy instead of attacking directly. Another kind of guerrilla ant often appears and disappears unpredictably, making feints to the east and attacking in the west, disrupting the enemy. This can be regarded as the most brilliant tactic.</p>
<p>For example, when the Siafu ants of Africa march, they often form a dense column that is forty feet wide and several miles long. If they enter the territory of an enemy country, a team of soldiers is immediately dispatched, while the main force continues to advance. This team of soldiers then immediately separates again, one part completely blocking all the exits of the city to be attacked, and the other part rushes forward, and then the fight begins.</p>
<p>Sometimes teams of soldiers are constantly dispatched from the main camp, advancing at different angles. They are always dispatched from the flanks or behind the main camp, so that the front line always maintains its strength to prevent surprise attacks.</p>
<p>Once it comes to hand-to-hand combat, no one in the world can be as tenacious and brave as an ant. Once it bites an enemy, it will not let go until it dies. Even if its own head has been cut off, its iron jaws will still bite so desperately.</p>
<p>A person who is cowardly and does not move forward is not as good as an ant, and a person who is a tool of the tiger should be even more despised by ants.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Tiger's Might <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>Tigers are fierce beasts that prey on dogs, sheep, and other animals for food. Smaller animals mostly fear them. What is most strange is that even dead tigers, even those with dismembered limbs, are still enough to intimidate other animals. More than ten years ago, Xiamen police shot and killed a tiger in the mountains. This tiger was a Bengal tiger, taller and paler in color than those produced in mainland China. Several people carried it to the city so that the public could view it. And the dogs in the streets, seeing the tiger's corpse, all tucked their tails and fled, showing fear. Later, people from the Biology Department of Xiamen University skinned it and made it into a specimen. When its internal organs and various organs were thrown on the ground, the dogs that saw them also hesitated and fled. Is it because they smelled the tiger's scent and were afraid? The development of animal instinct is indeed undeniable.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Tiger Meat <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>When the tiger's bones were carried to the biology lab at Xiamen University, there were two large masses of muscle attached to the base of the upper and lower jaw bones, which are called the masseter muscles. I ordered the specimen maker to take them off and cut them into pieces, filling a large pot. I mixed them with spices, soy sauce, and other things and stewed them, like braised beef. After a day and a night, they were finally cooked and tender. Because I thought that in one's life, how many times can one eat tiger meat? This was a rare opportunity. So, I invited colleagues from the school to taste it together. Some tasted it and left, while others came to watch but hesitated to try it. I ate a few pieces and felt that the muscle texture was very coarse, and the taste was like mutton, and also like beef, indescribable. Finally, I poured its soup on rice, but as soon as I swallowed it, I suddenly felt like vomiting. The taste was not bad, but there was something indescribable that made my stomach unable to accept it. I really don't know why.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Alcohol Meter <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Ren</p>
<p>Someone in England recently invented an alcohol meter that can not only make it easier for judges in court to determine whether a defendant is drunk, but also, if he is indeed drunk, to distinguish to what extent he is drunk.</p>
<p>First, have the defendant fill a balloon with exhaled air, and then pass the air through a lick of sulfuric acid solution that has been colored by a permanganate coloring agent. The color of this solution is like the color of "Lavender" flowers. If it turns gray-yellow after ventilation, it means that the air exhaled by the defendant contains enough alcohol to determine that he is drunk.</p>
<p>Only alcohol is sufficient to change the color of this acid solution. The degree of drunkenness only needs to look at the amount of gas needed to change the color of the solution.</p>
<p>No need to argue with a drunk. If the air he blows into the balloon can change the color of the solution, there is no doubt that he is drunk.</p>
<h3 id="e88">The Latest Cryotherapy <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— (Gu Buwen)</p>
<p>Patients are frozen for five days to receive medical treatment, and tumors can be cured with good results.</p>
<p>According to July 2nd</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from St. Louis, Missouri, USA, reports: There is now an unprecedented new medical experiment, which is to freeze patients and put them into a temporary state of suspended animation. This matter has attracted the extreme attention of the medical community. It was obtained by two major physicians, Dr. Temple S. Fay and Dr. Lawrence W. Suriah of Philadelphia, who conducted experiments on some of their cancer patients. They also want to apply this cryotherapy to patients with lung disease, heart disease, epilepsy, and various other diseases.</p>
<p>This cryotherapy has been reported by the two major physicians at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association, and its outline is as follows:</p>
<p>Patients undress and lie naked</p>
<p>Small pieces of ice are added all over the body, and electric fans are used to rotate and fan. After three hours, the patient's body temperature drops below ninety degrees, and they fall asleep peacefully, appearing to be napping. Although they are frozen, the process is normal and painless. The room is kept sufficiently cold so that even when the crushed ice moves, it remains cold as usual. After five days, the patient is awakened with hot coffee and hot drinks. At this time, the patient smiles and looks happy, but has no memory of everything that happened. According to the results of practical experiments on symptoms, this freezing cold force can kill at least 10% to 90% of the germs of rampant cancer cells.</p>
<p>This kind of life suspension</p>
<p>therapy not only amazes the medical community, but also makes it difficult to know its advantages for a while. Therefore, it has prompted the medical community to urgently study the necessary steps of cryotherapy.</p>
<p>When the patient is lying on the ice, their pulse stops, but by means of an electrocardiograph, it is found that their heart is still beating. What is most surprising is that although their heartbeat is very weak, its rhythm is complete and without any abnormalities. Also, their kidneys and digestive organs have stopped functioning, but this is only a sign of ordinary moribundity, and there seems to be no unexpected danger. Because at the same time, the analysis of their blood shows that it is filled with slag waste, so there is nothing to excrete.</p>
<p>Metabolism—the process of nourishing materials to promote vitality—has now dropped from 2% to 10%. In short, patients who have received this cryotherapy will definitely not be infected with pneumonia or a cold, and the development of germs in their entire structure has been significantly hindered.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Finance: Operators Seem to Be Waiting, Cash Transactions Are Unusually Quiet <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market continued to improve, but the activity was extremely dull. The whole rotation was around 2,590 yuan, and the transaction was light. Blue operators were waiting for the clarification of the international political situation, so both buying and selling were always cautious. As a result, the price rose by five yuan because a certain money exchange industry came back and advanced again, and Tianjin Gang also stopped supplying. Although speculators once came to sell in the middle, it did not have any impact. Only about 300 taels were traded in the morning, and only dozens of taels in the afternoon. Gold ornaments in jewelry stores remained unchanged throughout the day, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Cash Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened higher by two yuan because a certain money exchange industry had a particularly good buying intention, resulting in a good market. First, a certain gold store bought twenty taels from a jewelry store at a price of 2,587 yuan, and then bought fifty taels from a peer at the same price. It then returned fifty taels to a certain money exchange industry at the original price. At that time, a certain money exchange industry also absorbed a total of 100 taels from a certain gold store (on behalf of a speculator) and fifty taels from a jewelry store, all at a price of 87 yuan. After that, a certain money exchange industry still had an appetite for the above transaction price, but there were no sellers watching, causing the market to be quiet for a while. Around 11 o'clock, the underlying trend continued to be slightly firmer, rising by three yuan. The gold stores mutually traded fifty taels at a price of 90 yuan. At noon, it jumped up another two yuan. A certain money exchange industry bought fifty taels from a peer at 92 yuan as the closing price at noon. In the afternoon, the transaction became clearer, and the trend was also flat. First, a jewelry store sold ten taels to a gold store at a price of 92 yuan. After entering, it was lowered by two yuan, and the money exchange industry mutually traded fifty taels at 2,590 yuan as the closing price at night. As a result, it continued to rise by five yuan compared to the previous day. The cash store's own brand gold was sold at a price of 2,595 yuan and bought at a price of 2,585 yuan. It is said that there are few transactions at present, with the bid gold being about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Remains Unchanged Throughout the Day</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael has not changed because the cash market is in a state of rotation. The Daretong Hang still hangs at 262 yuan, while the Xintong Hang is at 260 yuan, and the purchase price is 254 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Stable</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 10th, British pure gold remains unchanged, fixed at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 6 pence per ounce, so the market prices of the central banks have also not changed. The Chinese cash purchase price is 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao, the listed customs gold is 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen and 6 li, and the Shanghai standard bid gold price is 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Foreign Currencies Gradually Rise <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rates for British pure gold and British-American exchange remained unchanged. Foreign exchange houses in this city were actively settling accounts. Foreign banks readily supplied funds, and market prices remained stable as before. On the open market, gold shops and silversmiths were avid buyers, with the market price at 2,587 yuan. Later, enthusiastic buying from trade associations and retail investors drove the price upward, closing at 92 yuan in the high range at noon. The afternoon opened at the same price, but trading was thin, closing at 2,590 yuan in the evening, a further increase of five yuan from the previous day. The supply and demand for British-American gold pounds were not strong, with British gold pounds firm and American gold pounds slightly weak. Demand for both British-American gold notes was high, and the tension in forward exchange rates remained. The market price was firm and brisk. Hong Kong and German gold notes were also in strong demand, but supply was insufficient, resulting in firm prices across the board. Japanese gold notes continued to rise, with the evening price at 9 jiao, 9 fen, 8 li. Demand for large notes was even greater, at 1 yuan, 0 fen, 7 li. Korean notes remained stable, unchanged at 8 jiao, 7 fen. Trading in the association was thin. Hongchang sold five British-American gold pounds to Changtai, and also sold 50 British gold pound notes to Maofeng, and 30 British gold pound notes to Tongfeng. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: British gold pounds up 5 fen, British gold notes up 2 fen, American gold pounds down 1 jiao, American surplus notes up 8 li, Hong Kong notes up 6 li, Annam and Italian notes up 1 fen each, German gold notes up 8 fen, and Australian gold notes up 1 jiao. All other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Stronger Demand for U.S. Futures Exchange <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC posted rates without any changes. The black market for British-American exchange was very sluggish, presenting a monotonous state. This was because, although foreign firms had some settlement of accounts, foreign banks continued to provide ample supply, so the future trend was calm and activity was difficult. In the seven- and eight-month futures trading, US exchange dominated. The Western merchant Sassoon resumed buying in the middle, but the Bombay Silver Company continued to release funds, so the result was neither good nor bad. August futures were slightly firmer due to the dumping by Chinese firms and silver companies. There were very few seven- and eight-month swaps opened today. It was heard that banks were willing to post prices with a monthly interest rate of over 3 fen, but such opportunities were rare. Trading throughout the day was flat. Sassoon was only heard to have bought US exchange, and no settlement of shillings was heard. The Hong Kong exchange rate broke into the 44 yuan range, likely because foreign firms were taking advantage of profitable force purchases.</p>
<p>British-American Exchange Rates Remain Mediocre</p>
<p>Early in the morning, recent London large bar prices plummeted 8.125, and forward rates contracted sharply by one basis point. The price of silver in New York fell sharply by 1.75. The price of London refined gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate for British versus American was down slightly by 0.3 hao, flat against Shanghai, and down by 1 shengding against French. The exchange rates for American versus British, Shanghai, and French all remained unchanged. Central-listed exchange rates remained as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was British gold at 6 basis points, 5625, and US exchange at 12 yuan, 78125, with no increase or decrease compared to yesterday. After opening, foreign firms first force-bought HSBC spot British gold at 6 basis points, 5625, and also bought and settled a certain bank's spot US exchange at 2 yuan, 78125. The process was extremely flat. When HSBC announced its listed prices, there were no changes. And the balance tax for silver remained exempt from taxation. After this, trading in US exchange futures was more active, but the market trend was also very mediocre. It is estimated that a North China seller traded US exchange to the Orient company this month at 12 yuan, 625. Then, Huaxing Guohua transferred US exchange for August to a certain silver company at 12 yuan, 1875. Later, the Western merchant Sassoon bought US exchange from the Bombay Silver Company for this month at 12 yuan, 59375, and also August US exchange at 12 yuan, 1875. Near noon, there were only transactions in Hong Kong exchange. A foreign firm vigorously bought spot prices of the foreign bank Anda at only 44 yuan, in a rather soft state. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price for British exchange was calculated at 6 basis points, 5625, and US exchange was 12 yuan, 78125, no different from the morning opening.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Enters 44 Yuan</p>
<p>In the later market, foreign firms continued to force the settlement of spot British gold at 6 basis points, 5625, and spot US exchange at 12 yuan, 78125, with HSBC and other foreign banks and a certain US bank, and the situation remained flat. Afterward, the Indian Silver Company transferred to a certain bank US exchange for this month at 12 yuan, 625. The futures market trend was also stable. At that time, a foreign firm vigorously bought spot Hong Kong exchange from the foreign bank Holland at only 43 yuan, 875, and the market situation continued to soften. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling prices were British gold at 6 basis points, 5625, US exchange at 12 yuan, 78125, British gold for July at 6 basis points, 46875, US exchange at 12 yuan, 59375, British gold for August at 6 basis points, 25, and US exchange at 12 yuan, 1875. As a result, spot and July prices showed no difference, while August was slightly higher by 0.03125 for British, and slightly harder by 0.0625 for US. The Hong Kong exchange rate, calculated at the transaction price, was surprisingly tight by 0.375.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Discount Rate Shows Slight Decline <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills and notes decreased slightly. In the morning, it was still 93 yuan per thousand yuan. It wasn't until the afternoon that it gave way, falling to 92 yuan, which was slightly lower than the previous day by one yuan. The interest rates for money changers remained unchanged, at 1 jiao and 8 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3 id="e93">American Silver Falls Sharply Again <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>A London dispatch on the 10th reports that the silver market saw widespread selling and lacked support. India and speculators bought at low prices. After the close, the market stabilized. India took in deliveries at the listed price, but because sellers' intentions gradually faded, most were largely watching. Recent large bar silver prices fell sharply by 8.125, and forward rates contracted sharply by one basis point. A New York telegram reports that American spot also fell sharply by 1.75 to 3.5. A Bombay telegram reports that the Indian silver market collapsed, with spot prices down 23 anna, July down 28 anna, and August down a small 30 anna. A total of 300 transaction orders were made.</p>
<h3 id="e94">No Date Set for Issuance of Fractional Currency Notes <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance replied to the Chamber of Commerce via telegram stating that fractional currency notes will be issued by the Central Bank. Reports also say that they have already been printed in Hong Kong and may be issued at the beginning of next month. However, according to investigations, relevant departments in Shanghai have not yet seen any official documents, so the date of issuance is still unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Securities, Domestic and Foreign Bonds Plunge Simultaneously <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>In the informal securities market, the downtrend did not subside yesterday. Public sentiment gradually shifted from being soft to becoming panicked. Since rumors arose about the issue of interest payments, bondholders have been in a fog, groping in the dark for whether to buy or sell. The slightest stimulus would cause a tremor, so the market's instability was entirely affected by this. According to common sense, changing the payment of principal and interest to exchange settlement is beneficial and cost-effective. The current market price is also commensurate. If it is stopped, even temporarily, financial chaos will inevitably arise. The relationship between gain and loss is extremely important. Drinking poison to quench thirst is something the wise do not do. Yesterday's market was initially strong but then weakened, down by a small amount from the previous day. Initially, Shunheng Tiansheng was buying, and Fuchun and retail investors also had a strong appetite. Then, No. 35 was selling, especially Type C. Lianhe was active in selling Type A. In addition, Nos. 20, Xiedafeng, Yuanyuan Tongsheng, etc., were all providing supply, so the price could not be supported. At the same time, Nos. 11 and Tongkang slightly compensated, but the number was small, resulting in a low closing price. The trend is still quite uncertain. As a result, the market price was down by 1.12 to 1.6 yuan from the previous day. The total number of transactions was estimated at 6-700,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 25 shares of Commercial Press were traded at a price of 67.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The price reported by the Public Industry Association seems stable, and there is little trading activity. There are no unexpected news items that could increase buying power. Although there are unfavorable situations, the stock market has already been hit, but selling pressure has not been crowded. According to convention, trading is often slack at this time of year, but there are still inquiries in the market. The traded shares are also slightly broader. Last week, the stock of British rubber raw materials decreased by another 1,700 tons. Progress continues to be seen in the statistical situation of commodity raw materials.</p>
<p>The listed prices of London British-owned Far East companies' shares on the 10th of this month (Monday) fell slightly. HSBC Bank shares each fell by half a pound. Shares registered in London were 79 pounds, and shares registered in Hong Kong were 80 pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine and Korean Coal Mine each fell by 3 pence, the former being 17 shillings and 9 pence, and the latter being 4 shillings and 9 pence. All others remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The listed prices of London Chinese foreign debt on the 10th of this month (Monday). The main bonds guaranteed by the upper-level salt tax have fallen again. Sino-French US dollars (with seal) and British-French loans (British-issued) each fell by 4 pounds. The new low prices were all 40 pounds. All others fell by 1 pound. British-German Continuation (British-issued) was 46 pounds, Crispe was 21 and a half pounds, and Reorganization (British-issued) was 32 and a half pounds. The Beining Railway's public price was 44 pounds. All others remained unchanged. London spot offers for sale include 1,500 pounds of Reorganization (French-issued, with seal), selling at 30 pounds, 15 shillings, down 1 pound, 15 shillings compared to the British-issued listed price. Also, 1,500 pounds of German-issued (with seal) were sold at 27 pounds, 2 shillings, 6 pence, down 5 pounds, 7 shillings, 6 pence compared to the British-issued listed price. Also, in this city, there are also 600 pounds of Reorganization (French-issued) for sale, but the price has not been offered.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Yarn and Cotton: Speculative Maneuvering Ultimately Unsustainable, Cotton Yarn Market Takes a Sharp Turn Downward, Difficult Transportation and Limited Actual Sales, "Double Horse" and Other Yarns Fall by 10 Yuan Each <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen sharply the previous day, suddenly declined yesterday, and the speed of the changes and the magnitude of the fluctuations made it very difficult to grasp. This situation was entirely due to the actions of general speculators. According to investigations, the goods transported by the Guangdong guild mostly entered and exited through Mazhang. That place requires the addition of taxes on goods passing through. Cotton yarn, in particular, is heavily taxed. Secondly, because of the concentration of Japanese warships in Beihai, the situation is tense. Thus, the market reacted abruptly and turned downward. According to people in the industry, in fact, from the perspective of the cotton yarn itself, with tight credit, it is impossible to accept loans. All seaports are blocked and obstructed everywhere. However, the bullish concept in the industry has never stopped. Rumors of North China collecting cash and not recognizing it in legal tender were met with deep suspicion. Everyone was buying in, and as a result, the market price advanced steadily. Unexpectedly, when prices are high, buyers can profit, and the desire to exit the market arises spontaneously. For a time, everyone in the industry took the same step. When the market had few takers, the downtrend was intense, and the market turned sharply downward. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn went from 490 yuan straight to 477 yuan, and there was still difficulty selling it at the closing price. This situation is inevitably too violent.</p>
<p>The current yarn market situation: At the opening of the morning market, carrying on the momentum of the previous day, industry peers gathered together and unanimously shouted prices high. However, it already showed signs of being at the end of its strength, with hesitation to move forward. The ticket price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn opened at 482 yuan, and the outside price was 489 yuan, both up 2-3 yuan. As soon as these prices opened, sellers on the table poured out. Guangdong guilds also had agents who made some progress at the opening, but then were seen releasing. As a result, the market situation was greatly relaxed. Shouting prices were small, and bad news came in droves. Although Mr. So-and-so, etc., had the intention to maintain prices, even though their economic situation was considered sufficient, at this urgent time, the money industry could not be accommodated, and there was no way to think. They had no choice but to leave. Until the closing price, the spot price of "Double Horse" was 477 yuan, and the ticket price was 469 yuan. Checking the opening and closing prices reveals a huge difference of 13-14 yuan. As a result, the half-day transaction statistics were 895 bales, with 20-count "Double Horse" down 10.5 yuan, "Shepherd" down 7 yuan, "Double Globe" down 10 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn also down 2-3 yuan. The factory opened with 30 bales of 23-count Dafa from Chongxin Factory, with a price of 117 yuan, all cash. The amounts bought by various guilds are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Hong Kong 355 Industry Peers 520</p>
<p>Inland 10 Total 805</p>
<p>Previous Day's Transactions 190</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market began to rise again, and then gradually declined, resulting in a very tired market. This is because the route for yarn sales is declining, and all routes are affected by tight credit, making it difficult to move goods. The current price for 20-count Yueqin yarn is 386 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Shenxin Urges Delivery of Goods, Deadline for Advance Payment This Month, Customers Who Have Made Profits of 100 Yuan But Have Not Yet Delivered Goods <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Shenxin Yarn Factory has recently notified all customers that the yarn that was purchased previously, including the 20-count "Double Horse" yarn opened last year at a price of 368.5 yuan, and 390 yuan, are all 30% cash and 70% exchange, and the 410 yuan is all cash. According to the current market price, each piece of cotton yarn can profit 5-60 yuan to 100 yuan. However, these customers have not yet come to the factory to advance payment for delivery. The deadline is now set at July 15, after which they will be canceled and invalid.</p>
<h3 id="e98">US Loan Cotton Prices Will Be Maintained Above Eight Points, Trading in Local Cotton Turns Dull Again <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: At the opening of the fine and short cotton market, the industry was active due to the reduction in the weekly field report, and banks and other parties were vigorously buying. The opening price rose by 6 pounds. It is widely rumored that the US government will exchange cotton for goods from other countries and is currently in negotiations. According to news from Washington, the US cotton export subsidy plan will be announced this weekend, with each pound subsidized at a large amount, perhaps around 1.5 fen. Loan cotton prices will also be maintained between 8.25 points. As a result, people are extremely excited, and the price has surged by 17-18 pounds. However, due to the impact of US cotton subsidies, India, along with predictions, has fallen sharply by 2 rupees, and Egypt has fallen by more than 40 pounds.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is becoming increasingly difficult. Although credit is extremely tight, larger factories have enough inventory to last for five months, so trading is particularly quiet. The difficulty is that it will be difficult for various industry players to operate in the future.</p>
<p>Trading in local cotton has entered a dull path again because the yarn market is sluggish, the factory's needs are quiet, and industry players also find it difficult to raise cash, so even if they have the intention, it is difficult to develop. The quietness of business is the reason for this. There was only one transaction by industry players, which was a mixed price, with Bailuo taking 200 pieces at a price of 101 yuan, HSBC settlement, and a smooth flow of goods from northern Jiangsu. 734 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Piece Goods, Autumn and Winter Futures Trading Scattered <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market price was still soft. The factory prices for white goods were all high. However, the industry and hoarders have a very large stock of goods on hand. Recently, they have been affected by the tightening of credit, and most tend to sell. Only a few with financial resources still have plans to increase the amount of hoarding. Very few futures orders are opened. First, the prices of most long-term goods are viewed favorably, and the opening prices are all high. Second, customers lack confidence in future business operations and are also afraid that credit will be squeezed in the future. Therefore, although the autumn and winter season is approaching, long-distance customers are not as keen to open orders as early as in April and May. This can show the dominance of speculators. Current sales are still very weak. The Guangdong and Hong Kong guilds handled more than 50 bales of Fugui Aizi fine twill and Dapeng Fugui fine cloth, and 40-50 boxes of colored cloth, colored twill, and printed goods. The Sichuan and Yunnan guilds have tight credit and lack wholesale transactions. Bulk transactions in colored cloth are common in Taizhou and other places in northern Jiangsu, with more than 1,000 pieces transacted. The Ningbo guild in eastern Zhejiang has approved two batches of imports, totaling nearly 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, and group cloth. Various ports in eastern Zhejiang continue to ship small amounts of coarse cloth using sailboats. Foreign business is progressing quite well, with Singapore and Siam continuing to handle 1,000 several hundred pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and printed cloth. Shipments to Tianjin and Yantai in North China are also continuing.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, the momentum of white goods in the street showed slight activity, with more than 700 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill transacted. Therefore, the Longtou fine cloth has risen back to 13 yuan and 5 jiao. However, the prices of fine cloth and fine twill of each brand in the lower tier still have not improved. Selling pressure has gradually stabilized, and the downtrend has slightly subsided.

<p>True pullover woolens are specially ordered directly from foreign manufacturers by woolen cloth firms (a small number of upscale Western clothing stores also custom-order them). The patterns are usually one type per set. The amount is sufficient for "crown material", with each set being 3.25 yards. If you want to identify the authenticity of pullover woolens, just look at the yardage tag at the end of the set. Because the yardage tag is printed with the place of origin, factory name, place name, quantity, and number of the set.</p>
<p>Currently, the brands of pullover woolens in Shanghai include J&amp;J Minnis, August Dormeuil &amp; Cie, also known as ADC for short, George Roberts &amp; Co, and Harding &amp; Messenger. Some time ago, "Genbiao" pullover woolens were also popular for a time, but now the most fashionable, popular, and expensive should be a type of "Minnis". The "Dormeuil" products have a relatively long history of sales. Its George Roberts and Harding Messenger, etc., have only recently appeared in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The price of pullover woolens is mostly above 100 yuan per set. Those under 100 yuan are rare. Recently, since the exchange rate has shrunk greatly, it is no longer possible to purchase a set for less than around 200 yuan. (Jun)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Grains, Flour Sales Are Sluggish, Factories Are Already Reducing Production, Only Japanese Merchants Are Buying Wheat <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The flour market has not changed. Customer sales are still sluggish. In addition to a few sporadic embellishments in both the north and south, there has been no large-scale movement. As factories do not have hope of customer sales for the time being, and as it is hot summer, they have temporarily shut down some equipment in order to reduce production slightly. This is also subject to environmental control. Yesterday, the unified market trading still relied mainly on the street's retail sales. More than 10,000 bags of No. 2 flour of each brand were removed from the street and by traders from mainland guilds, at a price of 4.6 yuan in cash. The asking price for current Western flour is still 4.7 yuan in cash, but it is only a matter of asking without sales.</p>
<p>The wheat market continues to decline because shipments on the Shanghai-Nanjing route are gradually increasing. Chinese factories have been accumulating Western wheat for a long time because the sales of flour have been sluggish. There has been no formal intent to buy. In addition, another boat of Australian Western wheat is about to arrive, and people are becoming increasingly unsupported. Hoarders on the street rarely ask questions. Only the Japanese factories have been taking deliveries. A total of more than 1,500 bags of Nanjing, Wuhu, Changzhou, Danyang and other wheat were traded on the unified market, with prices ranging from 6.67 yuan to 5.58 yuan, which is a continuation of the decline of several points to about 1 jiao compared to the previous time.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Round and Fine Rice: The Future Market Will Improve <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Du Round Grain: Customer shipments, from He Xia, a total of more than 1,000 bags of Songjiang No. 5 were delivered to the Songjiang guild. Donglun Baozi is still coming from Fengjing. The early market opening showed that the street sales market was still sluggish. Mainland guilds did not move, resulting in a continued weak situation. The market for thick and thin round grain fell by another 0.2 jiao. But in the afternoon market, the price had fallen through. Suddenly, there was a move, and the market situation gradually became more active. Sellers had already started shouting prices high, but as a result, there was still no change.</p>
<p>Variant Yuan: Also continued to decline by 0.2 jiao. But because the market price was low, it has aroused inquiries.</p>
<p>Customer Fine Grain: After the opening of the market yesterday morning, customers' appetite for imports slackened, and reports that the place of origin was low and that it could be transported as usual. As a result, some wholesalers and traders were depreciating to sell, and then were affected by the wild crash of round grain. The market clearly showed a downward trend. All levels of high grain fell sharply, by as much as two, three or four jiao. Lodging decision makers were even weaker. Later, Hangzhou and other inland guilds took advantage of the opportunity to buy nearly 1,000 bags. The street countryside also slightly asked questions, and the market gradually stabilized. The total number of transactions throughout the day also increased to 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Oil Cake, Hankou Late Beans, Sold Open Yesterday, The First Time Since the War <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Soybean market conditions: One, because it is currently the time of year when new crops are not yet available, and two, Dalian beans are subject to exchange rate controls, and commercial transportation is restricted, and the source is greatly affected. As a result, public sentiment is booming. The previous market (10th) saw all beans rise sharply by three, four, or five jiao. Yesterday, although traders from Changshu and the inner river district of the main street were still eager, the potential trend was already tending to level off. Statistics show that 14 cars of Dalian Siping Street were sold at 9.92 yuan, 9.95 yuan (goods are outside the warehouse, so they are cheaper because external fees must be added), and 10 yuan (goods are in this warehouse). 40 bags of Pudong Large Grain beans were priced at 11 yuan. More than 300 bags of Hankou Zha beans were priced at 9.1 yuan. Also, 350 bags of Hankou Late Beans were priced at 9.2 yuan. It is said that this Chenyun bean was the first to be listed since the war, and the goods were transported by Japanese merchants.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. According to Reuters dispatches, there was a slight decline. August at 7 shillings, 10 pence. December at 6 shillings, 3 pence. March of next year at 6 shillings, 4 pence. The public association's listed prices for spot 24 coarse whites were slightly loose. 29.8 jiao in this warehouse. 29.6 jiao outside the warehouse. 21.5 yuan for transshipment goods. Taikoo sugar had little change. Only H Mark cart red was transacted at 20.2 yuan for cash, a total of 3,000 bags. All others remained unchanged. After several days of sharp rises, the price of domestic sugar has been high and the market sentiment has gradually stabilized. Only a few dozen bags of superior white powder were opened yesterday at 29.5 yuan. The rest was just shouting prices.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Dried and Preserved Goods: Xuzhou Vegetable Ascends to New Levels, Excellent Body and Color, Sold for 40 Yuan <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Daylily: Yesterday, I heard that 6 pieces of new goods from Shao Zijis Estate arrived, with excellent body and color, and were purchased by Guangdong guilds for 40 yuan. Check that the yield this year is very good, with dry bodies and bright colors, and everything. As the source of supply in northern Huai is blocked, the opportunity for these goods is quite good, and the large next batch will be arriving soon.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Silk and Tea, Some Transactions in Tin Silk <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Silk Market: Yesterday, there was nothing to speak of in terms of increase or decrease. The spot price in Yokohama was the same as the previous market. The long-term price was 1118 yuan. There have been no increases or decreases for several days. The recent price in New York rose by 1.5 fen. The long-term price remained unchanged. Spot prices all fell by 1 fen. Only 19 files were transacted in the New York silk market yesterday, only one-tenth of the heyday. The dull situation in the foreign silk market can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Local Silk Market: There were slight sporadic transactions in Wuxi silk, with no up or down in prices. In the local factory silk market, new silk has not yet been produced, and there are still many twists and turns in transportation prospects. Therefore, manufacturers generally do not sell off temporarily. Yesterday, only 30 dan of white factory silk and Jiaxing silk were transacted.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Hardware, American Tinplate Sales Still Smooth <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Trading in American tinplate has been smooth recently. Traders from Tianjin, Qingdao, Wenzhou, Yantai, and Fujian are showing vigorous appetites. Factories on this street are also actively purchasing. The main reason why this goods can be active in the market and not be crowded out by Japanese goods is that the quality of the goods is high, the color is dazzling, and the standards have to rise. Currently, the selling prices on the market are 38 yuan per picul for 18 to 24 gauge, 41 yuan for 26 gauge, and 43 yuan for 28 gauge. Other 48-sheet thin goods, 3.7 feet each, sell for 4.2 yuan per sheet, an increase of 6-7 yuan (per picul) and 6-7 jiao (per sheet) compared to the previous time. It is said that 2-300 bundles were opened yesterday.</p>

<p>Recently, new spot white lead wire is extremely tight. General customers and factories are all actively dealing in white lead wire, and the standards have also been raised. The actual delivery side is satisfactory. Yesterday, about 5-600 piculs were opened, and the market price increased by 3-4 yuan. For example, No. 1 to No. 7 sells for 16 yuan, No. 8 to No. 13 sells for 18 yuan, and No. 14 to fine patterns sells for about 20 yuan. The unit is calculated per market picul. White lead wire such as No. 8 to No. 16 is 25.5 yuan, No. 16 to No. 20 is 30 yuan, and No. 21 to No. 25 is 50 yuan. Although the selling price is inferior to the golden age, it has risen appreciably compared to normal times.</p>

<p>Since the exchange rate changes, Indian bituminous coal has been active at one time by local customers due to hoarding, but recently the doing price has become higher and higher, so that the running customers have withdrawn and the sales stomach is weak. The daily arrival of the cargo has become broader, and the market price has also dropped slightly. Yesterday, a certain firm opened, calculating the price of Indian unified coal at 46 yuan per ton, and screened blocks at 48 yuan.

<h3 id="e110">Intelligence Widely Applied <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>Everyone wants to be smart, intelligent, and wise, and no one wants to be foolish or stupid, because smart people benefit from everything, while stupid people always suffer losses, and everyone wants to gain advantages and avoid losses. Therefore, everyone wants to be smart, and if they are not smart, they want to study and even "create" intelligence. Since there is such a need for intelligence, perhaps broadening it—intelligence, another name for smartness—is not an unwise approach. However, I must state that what I mean by broadening is to add and replace things that go beyond what is generally considered smart. Therefore:</p>
<p>Starting from a person's childhood. In the past, the intelligence we knew in young children was proper behavior and politeness, or being able to recite poems and write verses, and being praised as child prodigies. Now, smart children are different: they can twirl guns, deceive people, have oily tongues, speak the slang of the urban lower class, curse, steal things from their homes and even from others, gamble, ...</p>
<p>In schools, whether elementary, middle, or high, the smart students we saw in the past were those with good grades and a solid foundation of knowledge. Even in the imperial examination era, the smart students valued were those who could write well and pass the exams based on genuine talent and learning. But now, things are different: First, as long as you have money, you can buy your way step by step to a foreign doctorate; genuine book learning is unnecessary, so the genius for intelligence is used for other things: asking classmates to "pass" during exams, copying, seeking favors from teachers, ... It is said that in some schools, one doesn't even need to attend classes to get semester grades and graduation grades. In some foreign schools, one doesn't even need to go to school to get their doctoral degrees, etc. These are, of course, good methods for smart students.</p>
<p>Once in society, new-style smart tricks are even more numerous. Summarizing them into principles, we have: Those who understand the times are heroes, a wise man avoids immediate losses, steer with the wind, bend one's arm inward, steal punches, benefit oneself at the expense of others, ... While the original concept of "a wise man is not perplexed," understanding reason, distinguishing right from wrong, and all the talents for managing the world and people, praised by ancient sages and worthies, are not included. What I admire most is their ability to feign foolishness, so-called "seeming foolish" or "seeming clumsy," which they readily display when it is disadvantageous to them. Because if they only had those "great wisdom" or "great skill" in mind but did not perform this "great wisdom" or "great skill," feigning foolishness, they would fail and find it difficult to succeed. Only because they can feign foolishness can people be deceived by them so they can carry out their tricks of substitution.</p>
<p>Of course, my intention is only to compare the so-called intelligence of the past and present, and to broaden its scope. I do not want to suppress one and promote the other, or belittle one and emphasize the other. If someone wants me to express some opinions, to test my degree of intelligence, then I must say that modern intelligence is suitable for the times. When everyone is drunk, it is enough to eat the dregs and sip the thin brew. Why be the only one awake, only to become an "Ah Q"! If you think this is not my heartfelt statement, I cannot convince you, because I am, after all, not a sage who can speak eloquently. But please look at their results, and you can believe it:</p>
<p>A child with modern widespread intelligence can gain the love of his parents, the praise of his relatives, and be praised as a good child, a promising talent, and a worthy son; a student with modern widespread intelligence can study effortlessly, steadily ascend to success, and obtain official ranks as easily as picking up mustard seeds. As for an adult with widespread intelligence in society, he can certainly establish a career, become a celebrity, a famous person, a wealthy man, or a high official, be admired by others, and feel that life has not been in vain. Look, aren't they all darlings of fortune, modern successful people? Then you can believe my admiration for them, because admiring successful people is a common practice for people of all ages, and I am not immune to this custom, so I have this heartfelt and sincere admiration. Because of this admiration, I wish everyone had this widespread intelligence, which shows my sincerity.</p>
<p>The difficulty is that, although such widespread intelligence can also be acquired through learning and cultivation, it is ultimately a difficult principle due to a person's unique endowment. Like me, my talent is much worse, even "a thousand thoughts" yield "no gain," so I can only watch others' "thousand thoughts" without "a loss," deeply envious. Unable to broaden myself, how can I broaden others? Perhaps what I have broadened is not worth a smile in the eyes of true intelligent people.</p>

<h3 id="e112">A Heartbreaking Story <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>——War Zone Report</p>
<p>Returning to Shangcheng, I learned that Mr. Zhang Naiqi had already walked into Anhui. Perhaps the Dahua Hotel had handed in "Good Luck" and put up a "Full" sign. The manager expressed his apologies for not being able to accommodate us, which put us in a bit of a dilemma; because there was only half an hour left before curfew, if the overnight accommodation problem could not be solved, there would be no choice but to sleep on the street. Sleeping on the street was not a big deal, but Miss Wu and Little Shen both contracted malaria, and the quinine pills we had brought had all been given away along the way. As everyone was hesitating, Lao Yao suddenly found a familiar name on the guest list—Leng Jun, "Ah, Jun is also here, the problem is solved!" He was so excited he jumped up and down. So, led by the manager, we ran into the courtyard, through a dark alley, and indeed found that "fellow traveler" in room number fourteen.</p>
<p>"Why haven't you returned to Anhui yet?" Jun asked with a smile, but with a hint of surprise.</p>
<p>"Well, I've taken a big detour!" I replied simply.</p>
<p>Speaking of Jun, I thought of the story he told me in Hankou: After the morning moon over Lugou Bridge was swallowed by shadows, people immediately worried about the attitude of Han Fuqu, the governor of Shandong; that is to say, whether "Han Qingtian" could shoulder the responsibility of defending the territory and giving the southward invaders a head-on blow seemed to be an unpredictable mystery. At that time, he led the Second Propaganda Brigade to set out from Nanjing across the Yangtze River, heading north along the Pingpu Railway. When they arrived in Tai'an, the news of the abandonment of Dezhou was confirmed, and a telegram was sent refusing the propaganda team to enter Jinan. "Old Han is really unreliable." The facts proved his concerns, and they had to retreat to Xuzhou, join the First Brigade, and take the Longhai Railway to Zhengzhou. "Old Han himself is unwilling to fight, and he won't let others enter his defense zone. At this critical moment, he still has feudal territorial ideas and handed over Jinan with both hands. That fellow is really unbearable!" He said indignantly on the eve of "Han Qingtian"'s execution.</p>
<p>This time he was sent to western Anhui because it was "suitable for people and place." He was indeed a responsible fighter, "I will coexist with Lihuang!" he declared firmly. Until now, he had not left the great Dabie Mountains and had not abandoned his sacred work.</p>
<p>That night, we settled in the two patients and lay down on the floor; a large dilapidated room was divided equally among twelve people, and it was difficult not to mention stretching legs, even stretching the waist. "I heard that Liu'an has been contacted, do you know?" He opened the floodgates of conversation again, describing the situation around Dushan, and at the same time opened the map and studied it in detail. "Liu'an may not be easy to defend for long. As long as Mabao can be kept, if they continue to advance to the southeast, they will be throwing themselves into a trap!" he said, a satisfied smile flitting across his thin face. Everyone's spirits seemed to be reinvigorated, and I wrote a seven-character律 poem on his "National Provincial Fine Map":</p>
<p>The vast Yu city is boundless, a guest pondering over the map and scratching his head;</p>
<p>The northwest frontier is broken and sighed, and the southeast half is submerged again!</p>
<p>To resist the invaders, we must shed blood together; to defend the country is not merely like tasting gall;</p>
<p>We will see the day when we recover the capital and sing songs of triumph, and together we will go fishing by the river.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Second Sweetheart <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Gong Chao</p>
<p>"Sweetheart" is a nickname for a lover; but now it has become the name of a transport vehicle.</p>
<p>Li Kaixing is a 22-year-old young man whose father is a wealthy businessman in Manila. Before the war broke out, he worked as a reporter for a Japanese newspaper, and in addition to his native language, he also spoke fluent English, Japanese, and French. After the July 7th Incident, he immediately resigned. In 1938, he returned to China with his like-minded friends and began his life as a transport vehicle driver in the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Their Philippine Chinese Overseas Battlefield Service Group consists of fifteen brave young members. Li Kaixing serves as the leader. Everyone comes from wealthy families, but they abandoned their lives of pleasure and drove transport vehicles, traveling back and forth in the war zone on the south bank of the Yangtze River, transporting military supplies to the front lines and sending the wounded back to the rear. They vowed to stay on the land of their motherland and continue this valuable work until the day of final victory.</p>
<p>Like all the members, Captain Li brought his own car back to the motherland. He cherishes this car as passionately and intimately as he cherishes a lover, often washing and repairing it himself, never entrusting it to others. He calls it "Second Sweatheart" (Second Sweetheart). One day, while they were racing on the front lines, they suddenly encountered a plane that chased them, bombing them with bombs and strafing them with machine guns. Li's car was hit with fifteen bullet holes. —And only fifteen bullet holes, nothing else was damaged. And Li Kaixing considered these fifteen bullet holes to be its most beautiful decorations.</p>
<p>Li's first sweetheart is his young and beautiful wife. He left her forty-four days after they got married and returned to his motherland to serve. This young captain received a monthly living allowance of sixty yuan, half of which he sent to his wife. He kept half for himself, but most of it was used to buy cigarettes. When he had to drive for hours in torrential rain or on pitch-black nights, cigarettes were his only good companion.</p>
<p>He is often on the road and cannot have regular three meals a day, so his toolbox is often filled with scattered food for occasional sustenance. Starving all day or not being able to rest for two or three nights in a row, such a life is very novel for this son of a wealthy businessman, and he is happy to live this life for the survival of his motherland.</p>
<p>After a year of service, not only Li's car had fifteen bullet holes, but the other fourteen cars were also covered in bullet marks. Fortunately, despite the constant bombing and strafing, only one of them was injured in the leg and was resting in a military hospital.</p>
<p>Their group is full of camaraderie. Whenever and wherever they hear a distress signal, everyone rushes to help. When they are on vacation, they are also the most active group, enthusiastically teaching Philippine folk songs, folk dances, and island games to their armed compatriots who are resting and recuperating in the headquarters or hospitals.</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Yesterday's illustration "Mr. Earth in Encirclement" was upside down. We hereby correct it. However, in fact, "Mr. Earth" is indeed in a state of "being hung upside down and suffering," so this mistake may be excusable. A smile.</p>

<p>— Written by Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>"Are you going to hit me?" Asunnya asked him.</p>
<p>"Yes! I have to hit you..." Vasika said.</p>
<p>When they got to the kitchen, he ordered her to take off her clothes.</p>
<p>"Please don't hit me too hard..." Asunesnya pleaded.</p>
<p>"Humph, okay, okay..."</p>
<p>She took off everything but her shirt.</p>
<p>"Take it off!" Vasika ordered.</p>
<p>"What, aren't you ashamed!" She sighed and took off her outer garment.</p>
<p>Vasika whipped her shoulders.</p>
<p>"What do you want? Isn't it winter now?... I'll freeze to death..."</p>
<p>"I want you to freeze to death! Are you still dreaming?... "</p>
<p>He pushed her out of the kitchen door and whipped her. He whipped her to the gate, drove her to the yard, and ordered her to lie on the snowdrift.</p>
<p>"Vasya... really?"</p>
<p>"Quick, quick!"</p>
<p>Then he threw her face down in the snow, buried her head in the snow, muffled her cries, and whipped her for a long, long time, saying:</p>
<p>"Sleep, sleep, sleep..."</p>
<p>When he let her go, she was shivering with pain and cold, crying and regretfully saying to him:</p>
<p>"Look, Vasika! You'll fall into my hands,... then don't cry, Heaven has eyes! Vasika!</p>
<p>"Go ahead and wag your tongue!" He said indifferently.</p>
<p>"Don't you sleep in the parlor again! Then I'll drag you to the yard, throw you out, and pour water on your head..."</p>
<p>Life has its own intelligence, and that name is called "opportunity"! It often gives us many rewards. But even more common is revenge, just as the sun gives shadows to everything, the wisdom of life is always and everywhere ready to take revenge on everyone's actions. This is true, this is inevitable, and this is what we should all know and think about,... (6)</p>

<p>It is heard that the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau has been ordered since the first three months to make shells, bombs, and all kinds of small firearms, etc., for the Westerners' Lai Fu, namely the rifled new cannons and the Krupp cannons and the Widget cannons. The projectiles used weigh forty pounds and twenty pounds respectively, and two hundred and five pieces can be cast every day. As for the gunpowder bureau, it is also able to serve the public to the best of its ability, and can manufacture one thousand five hundred pounds every seven days. It is also heard that the warships stationed at the Wusong estuary are all practicing daily, firing newly installed Krupp cannons. There is a Krupp cannon bureau where Westerners specially sent from Germany teach the boatmen of Feng and Shanghai warships, who are sent to Wusong in turns to learn. According to this method, everything is perfect! What is gratifying is that Western friends say that the Chinese already have methods for firing cannons.</p>

<p>HSBC Bank in Shanghai has recently been thriving, and shareholders have profits to earn every year. Because the original site is narrow, a large building is now being built next to the new customs house on the Bund. Although the project has not yet been completed, its outline can already be seen. The building is three stories high, each floor is very high and large, and the interior rooms are also high, spacious and wide, very different from ordinary buildings. The outer brick pillars and verandas are decorated in a magnificent way, almost dazzling. This is indeed a novelty on the Bund! In the past, the houses of the Liru Bank were rich and magnificent, and the doors and windows were well-equipped and superior. The interior floor was smooth, and the equipment was neat, ranking first among the major buildings in Shanghai. After the HSBC building is completed, the houses of Liru will no longer be able to claim to be the best. It is heard that this house has cost six or seven thousand taels of silver, and the base of the American flag company has also paid sixty thousand taels. As for the interior decoration, it is not included in the count. However, the fact that this bank can spend so much silver is enough to show a glimpse of its affluence.</p>

<p>— (New Dream)</p>
<p>A Death Certificate Represents a Greater Loss than War</p>
<p>Health Films Shown Every Night in the Gymnasium</p>
<p>The Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, as usual, holds a health movement every year. This time, a health education week was held again from the 10th, lasting seven days, and closing on the 16th. Indeed, people living in Shanghai, especially under today's circumstances, can avoid epidemics only if everyone pays attention to hygiene. Therefore, holding a public health movement to increase the general public's knowledge of hygiene has its important significance.</p>
<p>During Health Education Week, the YMCA uses various methods to increase people's knowledge of hygiene, so if you go to the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA these days, you can see pictures and slogans posted everywhere upstairs. How the human body is constructed, how terrible epidemics are, what are the vectors of infectious diseases, and what methods can people use to prevent infectious diseases? In addition to pictures, there are also slogans that are very vigilant, so that people can immediately understand the importance of hygiene upon seeing them.</p>
<p>Among many charts, what is particularly striking is a giant painting in the middle. In the center are words stating: "In Europe and the United States, the annual mortality rate is 15 per 1,000 people, while in China it is over 30. Calculating with a population of 400 million, the annual death toll should be over 6 million, the huge loss is more severe than any war. One person dying in vain causes the society to suffer economic losses. Averaging 500 yuan per person, the annual loss is 3 million yuan. This money can be used to start any of the following businesses: (1) Build 30,000 miles of railways; (2) Open 800 large factories; (3) Open 1,000 universities; (4) Open 100,000 elementary schools; (5) Open 5,000 hospitals; Build 600 urban waterworks projects; (6) Build 100,000 miles of asphalt roads. Surrounding it are pictures symbolizing the above-mentioned businesses. The scale of the loss is so huge, it is indeed alarming.</p>
<p>Besides upstairs, the four walls of the gymnasium also have various forms. During this Health Education Week, the YMCA also sent people to various neighborhoods to publicize health education, distribute leaflets, and hold health competitions. Every night, there are celebrity speeches and various entertainment performances, showing health films. The venue is in the gymnasium. Admission is free and admission tickets can be obtained from the association's office. On the first day of the opening, before seven o'clock, the gymnasium of the YMCA was already crowded. There were quite a few women, but the number of children was more than adults.</p>
<p>The lecture began at seven o'clock, and the speaker was Dr. Huang Zifang, whose topic was "Urban Life and Public Health." In his short speech, he explained very clearly how people in cities should pay special attention to hygiene issues, especially personal hygiene, and pointed out many methods of hygiene. After the lecture, female students from the Liangjiang and China Women's Physical Education Teachers College gave a physical education performance, among which mechanical performances and fire sticks were the most exciting. There were also Jewish refugee children performing solo dances and German exercises, which made people particularly sympathize with this group of small refugees who had recently escaped from Germany. Finally, two health films were shown, "The Structure of the Body" and "The Cleanliness of Clothes," which were specially made by Kodak. It is said that during this week, the entertainment programs and films are changed daily and are completely different. Such publicity for health education, benefiting the people, is naturally not small.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Visit to the Sick Children's Experimental Class at Duncin Road First Refugee Children's School <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Xu</p>
<p>Skin Disease Patients Account for About 20 Percent</p>
<p>Careful Medical Treatment for Recovery and Return to Original Class</p>
<p>This time I went to Duncin Road First Shelter to visit the "Shanghai Refugee Relief Association First Refugee Children's School" sick children's experimental class. This kind of facility that emphasizes children's health is very important and has the value of being introduced in an article.</p>
<p>The day I went to visit was in the afternoon. When the Principal Xu, who was thin and weak, led me into the classroom, a young teacher was telling the sick children about hygiene knowledge. Many hygiene posters and disease statistical charts were posted on the walls. They were all in high spirits and listening with great interest. Looking to the right, I knew that the classroom was arranged differently than usual. A space was separated by a blue curtain. "What's behind the curtain?" Under the leadership of the principal, I lifted the curtain and saw more than a dozen children, naked and unclothed, with pus-filled scabies on their upper bodies. A young female doctor, who was also a doctor in the small hospital in the shelter, was smiling and helping the sick children wash and treat their illnesses. Those sick children were about to recover. On their fair skin, there were still many scars from the scabies, showing the results of the treatment. There were also more than a dozen children with head lice, alternately washing their hair and applying medicine. I asked a ten-year-old sick child: "Has your skin disease gotten much better?"</p>
<p>"I've had scabies for a year and seven months," he replied with a smile, "Since entering the sick children's class and receiving daily medical treatment, the illness has decreased day by day, and the scabies has healed day by day. Mr. Zhu told me that it will be cured in another week." At that time, the principal took out a medical record sheet of the student for me to see, and the sheet showed the good results of gradual recovery. I couldn't help but feel happy for these sick children who suffered.</p>
<p>According to the principal, "This is the afternoon class of the sick children's experimental grade. There is also an early class from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM. There are more than 100 students in the two classes. These cured sick children will soon return to their original grades. One child who had scabies for nine years has now also been cured. Because their bodies have recovered their health, their studies have improved doubly, and their psychological hygiene has also improved rapidly. Recently, the number of students in the whole school has increased by more than 300 compared to when it opened. Those with skin diseases account for about 20 percent, and there are plans to add evening classes for sick children to meet the current needs and universally save suffering sick children."</p>
<p>In European and American countries, facilities that emphasize special education are valued. The open-air school selects children with weak bodies and minds, treats them, and teaches them at the same time. After their health is restored, they return to their original schools. The establishment of the school's sick children's class is comparable to an open-air school.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Working in a Furnace Room in Summer <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— A Whirlwind</p>
<p>Clothes as if soaked in a river</p>
<p>Head dizzy and swollen from the heat</p>
<p>A Silversmith Apprentice's Life Report</p>
<p>I get up at 5 o'clock, and looking at the thermometer, the mercury column is stuck at 90 degrees. There isn't even a trace of breeze around, knowing that today's weather will be terribly hot.</p>
<p>After hurriedly finishing the work that an apprentice should do, I ran to the masters' bedroom to change into old, patched blue cloth short shirt and trousers, and picked out a few bright red collar buttons. "It's so hot, smelting gold, starting the furnace, it's really troublesome!" The fat Ningbo gentleman sleeping on the bed looked at me, and his eyes seemed to sparkle with endless pity and compassion.</p>
<p>I smiled and quickly slipped into the furnace room. After shoveling out the ashes and charcoal, I immediately started the stove. The raging fire shone through the charcoal piled up like hills, illuminating the room that was over ten feet wide. When all the charcoal was burning and glowing red, I poured the hot charcoal from the pot to one side, and then placed the pot in the center of the charcoal.</p>
<p>About two hours later, the pot turned red, and our work – smelting gold – officially began. The bellows started to be pulled with a whooshing sound, and a huge fire surged up again, emitting a brilliant light. The bluish-purple flames closely followed the pillar of fire, jumping very high and long from time to time. The cold charcoal suddenly encountered a strong force and exploded with cracking sounds, with sparks flying everywhere. The face, hands, and chest could all be attacked by it at any time.</p>
<p>When the pot was red and transparent, the golden gold was poured in batches. Then, I used all my strength to pull the huge bellows rapidly, and the whooshing sound vibrated my eardrums and dazed my mind.</p>
<p>Turning the gold into liquid with extremely high heat, needless to say, our skin was smoked by the flames, and each pore felt like it was exploding, even swelling up. Because of working so hard, our clothes were like being soaked in the river. The sweat on our foreheads dripped down like rain. After wiping it away, more sweat welled up, so we had to let it be. I pulled the bellows hard, and even though my mind was dizzy and swollen, I couldn't relax even a little. Otherwise, the gold would break the pot and leak out. This hidden debt has always been considered the most terrible punishment by us; it makes us obediently work hard to smelt the gold. We smelt pot after pot, and when we saw that there was still a lot of gold that hadn't been melted, although ten thousand flames were rising in our hearts, we worked even harder.</p>
<p>When I walked out of the furnace room after smelting the gold, even standing in the scorching sunlight, I felt infinitely cool. Imagine going from a furnace room with hundreds of degrees to a natural environment of a hundred degrees, how could that not be considered extremely happy? Who would still be complaining about the heat there?</p>

<p>Chapter 14: Thousands of Homes in the Countryside Cooperate, Myriad Miles of Waves for Overseas Flight</p>
<p>Let's talk about Village Chief Zhu accompanying the two Miss He's, and Lover and Beloved, etc., coming from the Provincial 13th Seed Manufacturing Institute. The sky was already getting dark. Shuangquan and the others did not plan to stay in Freedom Village this time, but instead followed Zhu Lover back. They would come to Freedom Village again next Sunday. If Lover had time next Sunday, they would still come in her car together. If she was busy, it didn't matter. Her sisters could also come, because there was a public bus from Anle Town to Freedom Village, which made it very convenient to travel back and forth. Moreover, He Qiyu and her sisters had learned to drive in the United States before, but they were not as skilled as Zhu Lover and Jin Danyu. After returning to China, because their family hired a chauffeur, they didn't drive much, so they were getting rusty. When they came to this place and saw that many sisters were driving themselves, they thought that they would need a car to start a factory here in the future, and driving themselves would be more convenient. Therefore, they also wanted to learn to drive. They already knew how to drive, and they would be able to drive well after practicing with Lover's car a few times. Recently, many girls have been learning to fly airplanes, and driving cars should be even more popularized. At that time, they returned to Village Chief Zhu's home. Mrs. Zhu wanted to keep them for dinner before they went back. But Village Chief Zhu said, "Since they are not staying here, let them go back earlier! Next week, they can see the equipment in our new village. This is a new village built from scratch. We can't say how it will develop, but we just want to do it step by step within this small scope. I hope every village will be like this." Originally, with a future like Freedom Village, he was not worried that it would not prosper, but only afraid that it would not be able to be organized and complete. Village Chief Zhu wanted to maintain that good rural custom. Therefore, whenever a family moved to Freedom Village, they had to go through several inspections before they were allowed to come. First, if they were unemployed, only relying on some property as a property-owning class, living only by sitting and eating, they would not want them to come. Even if they were employed, they would also have to examine what kind of profession they had. If they were engaged in the kind of luxurious profession in big cities, they would not want them to come either. Their Freedom Village had the regulations of Freedom Village. Only those who could abide by the regulations of their village would be considered their villagers. If they violated the regulations of their village, they would be warned and punished for minor offenses, and asked to move out of Freedom Village for major offenses. Because the people living in Freedom Village all had the freedom endowed by nature. If you violated the regulations and harmed other people's freedom, they would not be polite and would teach you to lose your freedom as well. (157)</p>

<h3 id="e124">A General Review of Hou Yulan (Part 2) <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master</p>
<p>The Conclusion is "Undoubtedly a Star"</p>
<p>Yulan's grades at school were very good (grades are the overall average of drama, practice, literature, and conduct). From the first semester of the 24th year to the first semester of the 27th year, in the seven semesters of examinations, Yulan was ranked first in the first class four times, and the rest were all within the top five. Because of her diligence in learning, her inquisitiveness, her pure interests, and her upright character, teachers and classmates alike all valued her. After graduation, she was hired by the drama school as a teaching assistant and stayed at the school to participate in practical performances. When Xiao Bo formed a troupe, he specially invited her to cooperate and co-star, and the theater was always full, and her reputation rose. Her first collaboration with Xi was "Wu Jia Po" from Wang Baochuan, and Ling Xiao Hange specially went to see it and wrote a short commentary, which read:</p>
<p>"Hou Yulan has a broad voice and sings delicately, with an extraordinary air. This time, she is like Zhuge Liang's first accomplishment when he first came out of the thatched cottage, with a great future. When the applause resounded upstairs and downstairs, she clasped her hands together and paid tribute to the audience for thirty minutes, wishing this 'Lady Marquis' a speedy promotion to 'Great King'."</p>
<p>After Yulan joined an outside troupe, Liu Butang, a Pingju critic in the old capital, had two thoughts:</p>
<p>"For the past twenty years, the leading role of female Dan has undoubtedly been led by Mei, with Cheng and Xun assisting her, forming the situation of the Four Famous Dans. Now that the four are getting old, whether the so-called Four Little Famous Dans can inherit their mantle is still uncertain. At this time, Hou Yulan, a top student from the drama school, emerged.</p>
<p>What kind of talent Hou has, there is already a consensus in society. Considering her personal diligence, frugality, filial piety, and humility, she is truly a reason for her future success. Writing to this point, I have two thoughts: (1) I sweat for the current so-called Four Little Famous Dans. (2) Who will inherit the throne of the Dan world after Mei and others in the future, a man or a woman? And there will be a value of questioning with Meng Xiaodong's talent." Yulan has a simple and honest nature, and is innocent and lively. She is filial in everything she does. She treats people honestly and uprightly, and is polite. She lives frugally and does not pursue fashion. After graduation, no one has ever come to her door to woo her, but the newspapers still praise her without any criticism, which shows that justice is in people's hearts and sets a new record for female actors. This time, Yulan was hired to come to Shanghai, and Ling Xiao Hange gave her a farewell message:</p>
<p>"...I hope that she will find an actor partner in the future and dedicate her life to drama. Like the example of Xi Caiyun, the husband and wife sing together, or the wife sings and the husband follows."</p>
<p>After Yulan took the stage, I have watched her plays twice: one was "Selling Horses" and the other was "Si Lang Visits His Mother". Her singing, recitation, expression, as well as her hand gestures, body movements, and steps, all meet the conditions of a famous actor. "Selling Horses" was especially satisfactory. I now echo the words of my old friend Mr. Su Shaoqing and say: "This person is undoubtedly a star!"</p>

<h3 id="e125">Trip to the Philippines (Part 2) <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xuan</p>
<p>The city of the island is very clean, and coconut trees dot the beautiful scenery everywhere. The impression can be said to be very good, but the climate is really too hot. Our entire group of members all lived in the theater. During the day, it was simply too hot to go out. The daily performances were only one show from 8 pm to 10 pm. The only special thing in our lives was that we had to rinse our bodies with cold water several times a day from morning to night, otherwise we would get sick.</p>
<p>There are many overseas Chinese here, mostly from Fujian and Guangdong. There are also many shops opened by people from a certain country; however, the overseas Chinese are very enthusiastic and absolutely do not go there to shop. If someone rashly lost sight and ran in, it would immediately attract the attention of passers-by, who would write a note to politely dissuade them. If the person admitted their mistake, it would be fine; otherwise, if it was announced in the newspaper the next day, it would be a great disgrace that was difficult to face. Many of our partners knew that they were unfamiliar with the place, so when they wanted to go out to buy things, they were very wary and had to be guided by others.</p>
<p>The entire island area is very small – it doesn't seem as large as the Shanghai Public Concession. On a road called "American Street," there are as many as seven or eight high-end foreign movie theaters. There are also two theaters showing domestic films, "Central" and "Asia". Many new Shanghai productions are shown very early. The city's transportation includes no trams, very few cars, and mostly horse-drawn carriages, which are very cheap; for just five cents, you can go anywhere. In the evening, when the sea breeze was blowing, I liked to take a horse-drawn carriage along the coast.</p>
<p>The place where we performed was the Asia Grand Theatre. This period was the end of the lunar new year. Ticket prices were one dollar and fifty cents, and it was crowded every day. The performance program stipulated ten kinds of performances every day, and they were changed every three days. The last show was my drama. This place is ruled by the United States. Fortunately, during the performance period, we performed for nine lunar months. The patriotism of the overseas Chinese is truly extremely enthusiastic. Every time there was an impassioned performance or a national flag was raised, there was thunderous applause and a frenzy of cheering. We were therefore particularly excited on stage, to the point of being unable to hold back our tears. Because the climate was too hot, this life was really unbearable. After performing for two months, we were all eager to return to Shanghai. I know that I am too young and have not experienced much, but I have one feeling, which is that overseas direct transmission is a very urgent task.</p>

<p>— Fengxiang</p>
<p>MGM Pictures is a well-known brand in Hollywood. It not only has a long history, and is estimated to be the number one "Big Brother" in Hollywood, but also has a very strong cast of actors. There are as many as twenty-six who are well-known on the screen and have been promoted as pillars of the company, which can truly be called "a gathering of talents."</p>
<p>Now, let's list their names below, in alphabetical order by last name: Fred Astaire, Lionel Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Eddie Cantor, Joan Crowford, Robert Donat, Nelson Eddy, Clark Gable, Greta Garbo, Hedy Lamarr, Myrna Loy, Jeanette MacDonald, the Marx Brothers, Robert Montgomery, Eleanor Powell, William Powell, Mickey Rooney, Rosalind Russell, Norma Shearer, Margaret Sullavan ("The Shopworn Angel" female lead), Robert Taylor, and Spencer Tracy.</p>
<p>The above list already has twenty-five people. There is also the male lead of "The Shopworn Angel", which is currently being shown at the South Cinema, whose name is James Stewart. MGM recently raised his status and made him one of the pillars.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Harmonica Bands in Shanghai <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xinwu</p>
<p>One of the Historical Materials of the Harmonica Circle</p>
<p>The harmonica, after being promoted by several famous players, has attracted many young people. Shanghai can be said to be the birthplace of harmonica music in China. Over the years, many talents have emerged, and harmonica performances can be heard everywhere. Among them, there are many harmonica bands that play together, imitating the organization of a large orchestra and playing the music of a large orchestra, which not only reveals the value of art, but also demonstrates the spirit of cooperation. Although the power of expression is ultimately small, everything starts from small, and they are shouldering the mission of promoting and carrying forward.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the best harmonica band is the Fudan University Harmonica Band, which was around 1929. The second best is the China Harmonica Band. In the next five years, more and more talents emerged, and the YMCA's Dahua Harmonica Band, as well as the Guangming and Qingguang Bands, were established one after another. There are countless other small bands. However, that was still in the budding stage, and everything was very immature. It was not until the recent three to five years that there was rapid progress, and those outdated harmonica bands were gradually eliminated. Currently, there are four harmonica bands on this island that are larger in scale and have a more refined lineup. They each have considerable status and reputation, and they are all progressing. Here, it is worth talking about their general situation:</p>
<p>(1) China Harmonica Band</p>
<p>It has the oldest qualifications, with nearly ten years of history. It has gone through many vicissitudes, but it has still been able to exist, which is very rare. The instructors are the Wang brothers, a pair of harmonica experts whose names are unknown. There are a large number of students. There are currently about twenty to thirty basic members. As for the attached members, they are further divided into five teams: A, B, C, D, and women's, with a total number of more than one hundred. In addition to various sizes of harmonicas as the main body, the orchestra also includes large double basses, accordions, six small drums, timpani, and other instruments. The completeness of the organization is unmatched by other teams.</p>
<p>(2) Public Harmonica Band</p>
<p>It is the incarnation of the once-popular YMCA Dahua Harmonica Band, affiliated with the Public Harmonica Association, and led by Shi Renwang, a very famous harmonica player in Shanghai. It has been around for more than three years, and there are also quite a few members. Because of "My Lord Jesus," Shi occupies a strong position in church groups. A special feature of his team is that there is a large hanging hand piano to accompany them, which can show the beauty of harmony when playing sacred music.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Harmonica Band</p>
<p>Affiliated with the Shanghai Harmonica Association, it is the reorganization of the former Greater Shanghai Harmonica Band, led by Chen Jianchen. This team is smaller in scale, but the spirit of the entire team is excellent, and everyone is willing to work hard. Its style is completely in the original style of the China Harmonica Band in the early days, which may be because the leader came from China. Recently, the team has also been thriving.</p>
<p>(4) China United Harmonica Band</p>
<p>Affiliated with the China United Recreational Association, its members are all excellent members from the above teams, so the lineup is extremely strong. The instructor is Yu Yuxing, a very famous figure in the harmonica circle, but he is a "pessimistic" young man. He needs to be excited before he can lead his team to make great strides. The China United Harmonica Band is supported in this situation. This team is a purely amateur organization, and it can also be said to be a gathering place for celebrities in Shanghai. It is a pity that the organization is too loose. If it is revitalized, it will definitely be able to overwhelm everything.</p>
<p>Not long ago, several leading figures in the harmonica circle launched a joint viewing meeting for all harmonica bands in Shanghai, with no fewer than two or three hundred attendees. I think that if so many masters were to hold a charity united concert, it would definitely be a sensation. I wonder if the harmonica masters would be willing to create benefits for the suffering compatriots?</p>

<p>— Silver Thread</p>
<p>Bu Wancang is preparing for the filming of the "Ding Shi" costume drama these days, and is very busy. The props for this film are designed by Hu Xuguang, and the costumes are designed by Lu Shihou, and they are all being processed. The seedlings that were planted in the pond before have now grown tall and graceful. In another month, the lotus flowers will be in full bloom, and this outdoor scene can be filmed.</p>
<p>The second costume film of China Film Company, "Wang Baochuan", has been partially filmed. The scenery is extremely gorgeous. The artist plans to complete this film before the Mid-Autumn Festival, so that it can be released during the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>The name of "Desperado", directed and starred by Wang Yin, has been decided and will not be changed. Seven or eight tenths of the film has been completed. It is said that it will be listed as a production of Huacheng Film Studio, and will meet the audience at the Grand Theatre.</p>
<p>Chen Yunang set off for Shanghai on the 22nd. In Hong Kong, Chen wrote a long autobiographical article for the Zhujiang Daily, called "Reminiscences of the Past", which was published daily. Some newspapers in Shanghai also reprinted it.</p>
<p>Qiu Yun joined Xinhua. The first play was originally "The Flying Corpse of Lan Mu", directed by Xu Xinfu. Now, because Qiu Yun is in Guohua and is filming "Little Swordswoman" (starring with Hu Rongrong), she is not able to divide herself for the time being. Therefore, there is another rumor that the heroine of "The Flying Corpse of Lan Mu" will be replaced.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Xu Biyun Violates the Taboo of the White Tiger in the Pear Garden</p>
<p>His appearance was not very beautiful, especially his eyebrows and eyes had a murderous aura, and he had no charming appearance for playing the female Dan role. However, he was still young at the time, and he was not addicted to bad habits. In addition, he had several fashionable and beautiful outfits. Therefore, it was not difficult to look good when he walked out of the room. At that time, in addition to the Four Famous Dan, he was the most promising male Dan. Whether he performed in Pingjin or Shanghai, he could get good reviews. In addition to his good plays such as "Green Pearl", he also had "The Complete Jade Hall Spring", which competed with Xun Huisheng. He was also very much in the limelight for those few years.</p>
<p>Experienced people often say that there are both advantages and disadvantages in everything. Advantages and disadvantages are always connected. Biyun's popularity was mostly due to Meng Jun's support, who provided him with money to spend. However, his downfall and his current slump are also somewhat related to Meng. It can be seen that if an artist does not think about his own art, does not seek the general praise of society, but only relies on the praise and support of a few members of the bourgeoisie, then that time is the shortest and the most affects the development of his personal future. According to reports, Meng was the richest man in Dongwei County. There were many people in the clan, but they had not yet separated. Northerners have always attached great importance to several generations living under one roof, so the Meng family did not want to be an exception. Their patriarch had a unique perspective, so the family rules he established were also very special. All the children of the clan were not allowed to engage in prostitution or gambling. Those who violated this would be severely punished. However, they not only did not prohibit the smoking of opium, but also encouraged it. Every three to five days, they would cook hundreds of taels of opium and place it in a large vat. All the children of the clan would take small porcelain jars and receive opium paste from the cashier according to the household. The cashier was like an old slave of the opium den. (57)</p>

<p>Kun Dan, Qiu Yunyan, follows Jin Biyan. The Jin Bi Yan couple learn art, with great progress. Recently, the Modern Drama Theatre once invited her, but her parents politely declined. This beauty is planning to travel north for further study. Du Juchu has contacted Liu Zhenting and intends to invite her to Ping for performances, with a profit-sharing system. Liu is still considering.</p>
<p>Liu Hanchen is currently working hard on compiling private plays. His masterpiece is "Red Dust Swordsman". The first two volumes have been performed in Tianjin. Volumes nine and ten have recently been completed, but the title pages have not yet been completed. When the weather is slightly cooler, he will re-edit volumes eleven and twelve, whether it will be leaked and performed is undecided.</p>
<p>Musician Xuan Dingyi has recently been composing songs for the film Wen Suchen, which is very laborious. According to him, the film plans to shoot two volumes first, and the first volume has already been filmed. It is scheduled to be screened in Shanghai during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The theater has not yet been decided.</p>

Recently, we received letters from readers requesting us to continue publishing and asking the editor to add comments for research purposes. It is very difficult to comment on the games of famous players, because they are already famous players and must have considerable qualifications. The moves and steps each have their own mysteries. Winning is certainly gratifying, and losing is also worth learning from. We must not judge them by winning or losing, but must examine how the situation is conceived and how the application is skillful, and then add comments to get the essence of it. Therefore, commenting on the games of famous players requires considerable expertise, otherwise one will inevitably be ridiculed for showing off one's skills. The editor should follow the request of the readers and add comments, intending to conduct joint research. If there is anything inappropriate, I hope that experts will correct me.</p>
