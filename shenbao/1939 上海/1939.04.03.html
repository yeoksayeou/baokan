<h3 id="c8">汪精衛再主媾和 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>三五日前，香港電傳，在精衛撰文再主媾和，來電簡的，不知其所云。進則忘形，昧於政事而不識大體；退則怨允，乞靈文字而罔知邏輯；中國歷來書生，大都如此面目，如此結習；如在精衛者，謂非其儔歟？頃偶見在文譯文。其粗淺幼稚。至可慨歎。當彼叛國出奔，放言高論，或惜之以自絕國人，自絕前途；其實彼天賦不薄，徒以往年際遇，使彼不知復求長進，遂致滯留於幼稚粗淺之階段；是可惜在暴昔而不在今後也。在文初不值理會，不值駁斥；顧針對其謬誤，以說明和戰之分際，報人自有不容緘默者，請分別言之：</p>
<p>其一，戰爭之結束，必是議和，此乃最簡單之事理；故在戰爭中途，不但不虞和平之無日，且必愈戰而離和平之日愈近；所爭者，如何始爲把握最善條件之議和時機。條件不合，决不議和；時機未至，決不議和；不然，無論據何理論，取何口實，其客觀之結果，必是屈服。傳二十六年十二月初，即八一三後之百餘日，德國駐華大使陶德曼氏，曾向中國當局，轉述日本方面之結束戰爭條件。條件未經公表。但據聞其內容，視二十七年十二月二十二日近衛之聲明，較爲溫和；蓋近衛聲明，既有內地雜居與駐兵之要求，復觸及中國中央政府之體態；儼然以戰勝國自居，而以和平爲滅華之烟慕；聞德大使所傳不若是也。是以中國當局當初對於德大使如何應付，雖非局外人所得而知，亦未可遽信叛國者之所傳述；但以條件言之，先後既有出入，即未許謂應付德大使之態度如此，故對於近衛聲明亦務必如此。况抗戰之最初三四月，中國方面配備不及而驟逢勁敵，前方後方，均未穩定；閱年餘而至去年底，雖戰綫轉移，而軍事方面對於最後勝利之把握，允較初期爲强固。反之，日本方面敗徵弱點。暴露愈多。以是時機言之，未許謂去年底同於前年底也。</p>
<p>第二，和戰乃國家之大事，非同兒戲，未許輕赴也。故在危機當前，將戰未戰，可戰可讓之日，主持國家大計者，自應集思廣益，考慮周詳；而爲之國民者，無論在朝在野，皆應殫思竭慮，以貢獻於國家；於是決定戰或不戰。及至戰事既已爆發，惟有舉國一德一心，共赴大難；有國家，無小已；有國策，無成見；一切以軍事爲第一。無論在國民方面應自動將一已之生命資產，貢獻於國家，一已之言論行動，務合於國策；是在國家方面，自有全權控制國民之生命資產言論行動；對於任何性質之事事物物，凡有妨戰事者，自有嚴厲制裁之必耍。政府有執行之大權，人民有其隨時隨地愛護國家國策之天職。今明明自冒不韙，作此違反國策之言論行動，乃復歸咎於人「駡讒謗」；是無異根本吾定國家組織之存在以及國家組織之論據與價值矣。</p>
<p>第三，所謂中日相戰則兩敗俱傷，相和則兩俱榮存；此係空虛之哲學八股；今乃取爲主和之惟一論據，幼稚粗淺，莫此爲甚。蓋所謂相戰，必先問何爲而戰；所謂相和，必先問如何可和。中國不欲戰，僅爲生死存亡所關而不得不抗戰；不抗戰則死則亡，豈但傷而已。換言之，戰之發動在彼，彼不但不撒兵停戰，且進兵侵略之不已；試問中國除抗戰之外，詎有他途？在此不得不抗戰之局勢之下，竟反對抗戰而主張和平，試問除屈服投降之外，詎有他意？要知此决戰爭，不但戰爭之發動在日本，卽戰事繼續與吾之關鍵，至現在爲止，亦在日本。蓋必中國抗戰至於日本幡然改圖，撤兵停戰，中國始無所用其繼續抗戰。或抗戰至於日本實力消耗殆盡，不復能侵略，不得不撤兵，中國始有議論和戰之餘地。戰終於和，顧非所語於今日之中國也。若所謂東亞百年大計，百年安定，中日兩國共存共榮，日人言者多矣，言之久矣，顧其安定與存榮之內容，則征服中國也，其實行之方式，則征服中國也；奈何中國放棄以抗戰圖存之唯一途徑而應之耶？</p>

<p>威廉哈文港　德國三萬五千噸主力艦「鐵爾俾資」號、昨日午後在本港舉行下水典禮、希特勒元首躬親主持、並發表演說、其要旨如下、（一）德國以切望和平之旨願、簽定英德海軍條約、（二）如英國不存此旨願、則此的前提失效、（三）德國不欲攻繫他國、但僅欲發展其經濟利益、（四）德國在他國相迫時、將繼續其軍備、希氏演詞未有驚人之處、雖譏諷英國、但非責罵、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>先從戰前舊賬說起</p>
<p>威廉哈文港　希特勒昨日在十萬聽衆之前、發表萬衆久待之演說、希氏首先敘述過去德國所受之不公允的待遇、一九一九年與德爲敵之各國侵奪其領土、剝削其利權、德國處於四面楚歌境遇、自不能不有所活動、但一九三九年之國社黨大會、可稱之爲和平大會、（聽衆歡呼）德國之志願、固以和平爲鵠的也、希氏又稱、當威廉哈文初闢爲港漸臻繁榮時、德國與他國競爭、係採用和平之方法、但他國報之以猜忌、終至干戈相見、良堪惋惜、彼時英國對德採取包圍政策、英國曾表示勝德之後、各國皆可獲利、而彼時德國不幸採取坐觀其變之政策、不務自衛、終至戰禍爆發、諸事不利、良可慨也、然世人皆知德國英勇抗戰、奮不顧身、不幸而敗、非戰之罪、飢　摧殘其體力、而敵方之詭譎的宜傳、更炫惑其視聽、當威爾遜十四條原則公布之時、德國之　袖以爲和平可期而待矣、希氏言至此、列舉數端、以證明事實之結果與威氏之宜言完全南轅而北轍者、謂德國彼時誤信威氏之言、而捲甲息戈、初不料他國以剽竊之術、對德一再欺凌壓迫甚至生存之權、亦復備受朘削也、彼時德國遇事妥協、委曲求全、結果若是、余乃惕然憬悟、立志救國、以消泯國內之敵、聯合舉國之力、摧毀凡爾賽之惡勢力、爲按步就班之計劃、常他國政洽家宣傳維持世界之正義時、吾人之答復爲—所謂一九一九年之正義、非眞正之正義、乃少數國專橫武斷之暴令也、德意志國族立足於天地之間、應以保衛其自存之根本的利益爲職買、並非爲保障所謂英國的正義或法國的正義而生存、此義固彰彰明甚母待贅辭、</p>
<p>新德國已今非昔比</p>
<p>希氏復作豪語曰、而今德國已團結堅强、不必逢迎他國政治家之意旨、不必以他國之喜怒爲顧忌矣、於是氏將一九三三年以來德國之進展、作簡要之叙述、然後引諺語以自詡曰、「自助者　助之」、吾人兢競業業、自强不息、數年之間、德國果出幽谷而達光明之境域焉、倘英國政治家今認爲德國應經由談判途徑、與各國解決一切問題、然則十五年前、各國何不推行此議、作公正之解決方案、常時德國亦深望經由日內瓦機構、獲致良好結果、所可遺憾者、乃未能遂願耳、嗣此德國乃積極推行內政與外交、戮力建國、孰知世界竟同指德義兩國復興國家之舉爲罪行、得母佔有廣大領土之國家、始可謂爲善行耶、</p>
<p>譏英缺德體無完膚</p>
<p>按之實際、英國三百年來、有何品德可言、今乃以品德爲說敎、異矣、即就最近二十年來英國之作爲而論、實顯其並未了解品德之眞諦、此可由英國在戰後處置德國之作爲覘之、余誠不知世間究有品德兩字吾、溯自余秉政之初、早有經由談判途徑、解決重要問題之提議、惜乎全被拒絕、倘英國要求討論德國內政問題、則余亦將提出同樣要求、余相信其答復、必爲一巴勒斯坦與君無關」、所以德國生命攸關之利益所在、亦與英國無關、其理實相同、德國人民處此生存競爭之時、決不能放棄與生命攸關之重大利益、各國前乘德國柔弱之際、不顧正義、改更歐洲地圖、今則事勢已變、德國決不容忍之德國對捷克人民並無憎恨、此爲英國政治家所不能了解者、實則普拉格之聖維德斯敎堂、並非英法人所建、乃德國人所建也、</p>
<p>併捷係戰略上需要</p>
<p>由此觀之、捷克領土在過去一千年中、已爲吾人之利益範圍、德國此舉、實亦防範將來自身之危機、故已不能再事容忍矣、關於此點余可以法國前空軍部長之言爲證、蓋其會謂捷克乃進攻德國之根據地、此實爲吾利益攸關之大問題、環顧形勢、亦無和平解決之可能、余遂不得不以地理歷史之共通根據、將其兼併矣、捷克人民嗣後得享受以前所未得之自由、德國今盡最大之力、將對德國之戰鬥工具、改爲德國之安全基礎、所以余將命名今年之國社黨大會、爲「國社黨之和平大會」、蓋德國實無攻擊他國之意向也、</p>
<p>發展經濟唯一願望</p>
<p>德國現今之唯一願望、乃擴展對外經濟關係、德國之生產與消費、亦屬歐洲經濟制度之一、德國當以光榮之熊度、與各國進行貿易、以和平爲前提、對句圍政策是所不能容忍、</p>
<p>涉及英德海軍協定</p>
<p>至於德國與英國所打立之海軍恊定、亦爲德國對和平努力之一、倘英國繼續此志、則該項海軍協定自當繼續有效、但其他國家倘賡續擴軍、則德國亦不願落人之後、以保衛國家之安全、倘有某某國家欲測量德國之軍力、德國人民當不惜與之周旋、德國友邦對此當亦表同情、</p>
<p>德義軸心未嘗削弱</p>
<p>常見外國報章　稱、德義軸心國家之關係現已荏弱、甚至有決絕之論、此乃政治破壞工作之一、於事實全不相符、反之軸心國家間之關係、較其他任何國家間之協定更爲堅全、蘇聯與英吉利兩國如願合作、而不致使國際情勢益趨緊張化、則余亦願向其道賀、無論如何、德義兩國　思想之聯鎖、較之英國資本主義以及民治主義的思想與史丹林之波爾雪維克的思想、其組合之自然與吾、融治如何、明眼人可自得結論矣、</p>
<p>慶賀西國民軍勝利</p>
<p>希氏繼稱、最近數日之內吾人體騐得一極大之勝利、雙有一國脫離波爾雪維克主義之蹂躪、而獲得自由焉吾人對西班牙之勝利、固應欣然致賀也、德國之靑年協助友邦、獲得民族自決權、而他國之人則有往日以軍火供給紅軍、而今復欲與國民軍通商謀利者、人之度量相越豈可同日語耶、</p>
<p>不恤犧牲保衛疆土</p>
<p>總之、吾人內部業已團結、經濟生活方興未艾、日耳曼人得重居德土者不下數百萬、吾人願賦予中歐以和平、並當出力以捍衛之、前决歐戰、德人之爲國捐軀者不下二百萬人、而今大德國幸得完成、乃先烈之犧牲奠其基、吾人始得成其業、今後更當不惜任何犧牲以維護之、則先烈之或仁爲不虛矣、此心耿耿、願世人共鑒之、同志乎、他國之願簽締協約與發表宣言者聽之、余不信紙上之言、余所信者諸君也、（二日海通社電）</p>
<p>警吿波蘭勿作冒險</p>
<p>希氏演辭中並向波蘭發出警吿云、凡準備爲大國利益而冒險者、亦當準備食其後果、無論如何、他國倘以恫嚇政策、或以包圍政策加諸吾國、吾人決難予以容忍、吾國茲已決定保衛生存攸關之權利、非任何集團所能阻撓、（哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>耳、而所發生之事實、爲日本以一種日圓票源源流入華北、惟此種日圓票曾易一名稱以爲掩飾、此可以最初實行此舉時、日本銀行即不得不拒絕以大量聯準紙幣自由兌換日圓證明者也、蓋自由兌換勢必使日圓在日本趨弱、但另一方面、苟欲樹立日圓集團、此兩種貨幣之自由兌換、實屬必要、質言之彼等四項目的之一、迄今巳歸失敗矣、華北各外滙銀行之拒絕以聯準紙幣出售外匯也、日軍方面已頗多喧譁、指爲惡作劇、彼等甚目聲稱、</p>
<p>此等紙幣</p>
<p>之迄今未能獲得彼等認爲應得之正確價値者、即因不能購買外滙之故、日方如規定新貨幣與中國法幣同一價値、則日軍之怨言或具若干根據、但日圓官價旣爲一先令二便士、則當然不能出此、蓋日方如出此、則新貨幣已與法幣連繫、而非與日圓連繫矣、故聯準銀行一元紙幣乃規定一先令二便士之價格、但以價値八便士之貨幣購買物產之華北出口商、如被迫以價値一先令二便士之貨幣購物顯無與世界市塲相競爭之望、結果出口貿易乃吿停頓、日軍亦因此全未獲得出口業所餘之外匯、於是另一項目的、遂亦失敗、日人今似已處於進退維谷之境、蓋無論頒令與吾、聯準銀行紙幣必隨日圓下跌、使聯準紙幣緊隨日圓、與限制此兩種貨幣間之自由匯兌、勢必使進出口商業同歸停頓、如任其無限制兌換、則又必使日圓續趨軟弱也、</p>

<p>第六是運動戰與游擊戰的配合，只有游擊戰是不行的，一定要同時運用運動戰，不斷殲滅敵人給敵人更大的耗費，使敵人在全國這樣大的地區，兵力不够分配才能使他只能守着幾個據點，而不能維持廣大地區的統治。第七我們認爲今後作戰一定要軍事，政治指揮統一，使軍事和政治合於我們的戰爭要求，爲了便於戰爭，非政治與軍事配合一致不可。第八、在經濟上封鎖敵人，而自己要有辦法，要能自給，我們認爲在道樣戰爭趨勢上，在敵人動態上說，必須採取這些原則與方針以爭取今後戰爭的勝利，及第二階段抗戰的開展與完成，以便達到很快的把我們的力量準備好，爭取我們的反攻階段的迅速到來。</p>
<p>最後的結論：我們結論很簡單，是三個結論合攏作一個總的結論。</p>
<p>甲·根據一年來的抗戰經騐，我們應該：（一）發展我們在這一年中听得到的成績與我們的優點。（二）改正我們在這一年的抗戰中問所存在的缺點。</p>
<p>乙·根據一年來的敎訓，我們應該：（一）堅强我們的政治工作，發揮我們政治工作的效能到最高度。（二）不間斷的提高我們的軍事技術到必要程度，使適合於我們作戰的要求。（三）澈底肅淸游擊主義習氣，使我們軍隊一切入於正規。（四）根據這個敎訓鞏固和健全各種制度，使我們的軍隊成爲一個最靈活而有最大效用的一座機器。</p>
<p>丙·根據今後作戰的趨勢，我們應該：（一）學習運動戰使游擊戰與運動戰配合起來。（二）我們要到處組織和發動羣衆的游擊戰爭。（三）加强我們的宜傳工作和民衆運動。（四）要把敵軍工作（即對敵軍的宣傳和爭取他們反叛的工作）在全軍中間開展起來，變成我們全軍作戰員共同的工作，同時變成廣大民衆的抗戰工作。（五）保持和發揮我們新四軍的優良傳統。而目要創造我們新的優良傳統作風。這是我們適應着二十八年的戰鬥任務，第二階段的抗戰任務，並完成第二階段的任務，只有這樣才能使我們一天一天的健全起來，使我們一天一天的把弱點克服。我們在總結這一年來的經騐與敎訓，不僅是爲要找出我們的成績，而主要是認識我們的成績是從什麼地方來的，同時找出我們的弱點，在抗戰中有些什麽妨碍，怎樣克服？使我們成爲最健全，最有力的一個抗戰軍隊，使我們能在抗戰第二階段中有更大的貢獻，有吏大的勝利來完成我們的任務！（完）</p>

<p>— 特公</p>
<p>本文係Guenther　Stein氏於昨年底在香港時所著，原題爲“PacificAffairs”載本年三月份出版之“The　Yen　and　the　Sword”該刊方到滬，即爲四月一日出版之The　China　Wcekly　Review轉載，其令人注意可知，現蒙本報伍特公先生抽暇爲本刊迻譯，伍先生譯筆久膾人口，堪稱名著名譯，本刊對該問題，會於前週邀集貨幣專家舉行座談會，該項紀錄，業於上期本刊發表，今復助以外人對此問題之見解，更可相得而益彰，希讀者注意！惜以本刊地位有限，只得分兩期發表，尙祈譯者與讀者原諒。　編者</p>
<p>上期本刊會載座談會討論日人在華北統制金融問題的紀錄，頗受讀者歡迎。茲見美國有名經濟記者史坦Gueuther　Steiu　所著關於同一問題論文一篇，足以補充當日座談會諸先生所發表的意見，急把牠譯出，戰在下面。讀此一文，可見日本的對華戰爭，縱然不因軍事上受有重大打擊而淪於失敗，也必因經濟上的束手無策，而全功盡棄；只要中國能够持久抗戰，不達到最後勝利的目的，決不罷休。這是確無疑的。</p>
<p>中日戰前之貨幣前哨戰</p>
<p>貨幣已證明是此次中日戰爭中決勝的武器之一。許多密切觀察戰事者對於貨幣的重要性，雖估量太低，但中日雙方却早已明白這個事實，在軍事敵對行動實在發作前兩年許，中日貨幣戰爭業已活躍進行了。日人在一九三五年初，卽取攻勢，企圖將華北貨幣和「日圓集團」聯成一氣。他們滿望北方五大省能用這個方法和中央分離，卒由日本不流一滴血，不費一顆彈，完全征服。他們對心不甘服的國家强施這一着，不但憑籍外交和軍事的壓力，還利用北方種種不同的紊亂的政冶活動。原來那時中國陳舊的銀幣已呈危險狀態，日人深覺在金融市塲儘有取直接侵略行動的機會，他們所取的方一式，是從事搜括中國允其北方數省的白銀，那是中國的法定通貨。</p>
<p>因此日本便派員在華北依當時中國銀幣折合外滙的反常廉價收買銀幣和銀條，在當地日當局審愼指導之下進行順利，得數甚巨。中政府對於白銀出口，雖曾頒行禁令，終不能堵絕白銀走私運往日本。運到日本的總數，並不載見官方發表的輸入報吿中。但一經運到日本，便可大明大白地轉運赴英，據日本公布的對外貿易統計，自一九三四年至三六年運往英國的白銀，共計値日金二萬七千五百萬元以匕。此項白銀，不用說，都是來自中國的，因爲日本並非產銀之國。白銀運到倫敦以後，便按照美政府購銀政策所維持的世界高率市價售去，獲利甚豐。可是獲利一層，却出於巧遇機會。日本道種運動的眞正動機，不在求利，而在刦取華北根深蒂固的貨幣準備金，使牠不能保持金融上的地位，然後便不得不投人「日圓集團一的掌握，將來並可甩同樣手段逐漸處置整個中國</p>
<p>這種攻擊，雖使中國大受損失，但未能達到日人的主要目的。因爲中政府臨機應變，突然在一九三五年十一月三日實行幣制改革，這着固然已覺太遲，但仍不失爲亡羊補牢之圖，於是白銀完全收歸國有，不再作爲法定通貨，不准再流通市上，而用政府銀行所發行的紙幣爲代替物。換一句話說，中國已改用一種「管理的」貨幣，以避免日本的打擊，這是其他各國從前大都實行過的。中國立卽從事搜羅仍留在國內的所有白銀，政府所能收得的，至少還有十萬萬元（華幣）之譜，中國因此便搶前了日本一步。因爲這些白銀，不但在承平時可充新紙幣的硬貨準備金，並且遇到戰爭時，還可作爲一種潛能的應急基金，由政府自由處置，供在海外購辦軍火之用。</p>
<p>中國在不宣的貨幣戰爭中所取合於邏輯的對抗行動，上述兩端，允其是後一端，足使日人大爲不安，於是日本對付中英兩國政治態度立轉强硬，她所以仇對英國的原故，因爲據傳中國的對抗行動是由英國策動的。日本初猶深信中國的幣制改革，就純粹經濟方面而論，會在短時期中淪於失敗的。她以爲中國是一個落伍，僅僅半統一，且無法管理的國家，政府的權力和信義，都不够使現代所行國家管理的貨幣實行成功；再加中國人民數千年來用慣了白銀的，現在呌他們忽然改用紙幣，這種紙幣雖能購買外滙，却不能掉換現金，決不會稍獲人民的信任；中政府的這番改革，雖己挽回貨幣上的難關，但不久便將發生新難關，甚至比前一難關更見厲害，到了那時，「日圓集團一便有種種意想不到的膨脹機會。誰知中國的幣制改革，居然一帆風順，成效卓著，結果使一般經濟的進步，神速出乎中政府的意料，等到這種改革顯然已成一種工具，而由中政府利用，使國家的政治統一，利用海外的信用都迅速增進，日本若干方面的恐慌，便日益擴大。</p>
<p>法幣抗戰之驚人威力</p>
<p>若說日本此决對中國作武裝侵略，全由中國的幣制改革得到這些效果有以致之，那未免言之過甚，但歷史大的自會證明這是日本作戰的一個主要原因，正因爲將中國廣大區域併入「日圓集團」的志願，雖確然不是日本在華經營一切的唯一目的，然而這種志願在她計謀將來的方案中却常常流露，而比一般人所想像的爲大。日本的偉大軍事機耩到底在中國作大規模的運動了。貨幣武器目前當然已居决要，可是並未久擱不用。日本始終不忘她的原有目的，所以在北平新傀儡政權成立之後，最先促令實行的兩種計畫，其用意求奠定使「日圓集團」在佔領區，得以擴大的基礎：（一）設立「中國聯合準備銀行，」便牠發行的紙幣倚賴日圓；（二）頒行减低人口稅的新稅則，便利日圓新勢力範圍內的日本貿易的擴張。</p>
<p>中國也大大依賴新鑄成的貨幣武器的奮鬥價値。起初爲了純粹金融和自衛的原因，將白銀收歸國有，而因此產生的戰爭基金，其數至少等於日本銀行存金的一半，全由政府操在手中，充分利用。中國所以能發揮長期抗戰的驚人能力，這是一個主要因素。但是中國還知道用貨幣武器本身來自衛，而且防衛得很周密，無論何處中國正規軍遇到軍備優越的日軍，不得不撤退時，除留下許多游擊隊，困擾戰勝者的後方以外，還留下一件東西，甚至更令日軍痛心疾首：那便是紙幣，日人滿心希望將佔領地區併入「日圓集團」逼令中國人民和日人合作；開發經濟利源至於極度；且從軍事佔領得到新的實業和財政力量，這一切一切的計畫，都因爲中國的法幣僅僅是一張紙，便成泡影。</p>
<p>中國的貨幣抵制日人在佔領地區作根深蒂固的企圖，竟有如此巨效，這不是僥倖成功的。經過承平時兩年的完善統制，使新法幣得到民間的信用，於是政府便能根據這信用進行積極政策，甚至在日人所管轄的地區也發生效果。這種政策的主要目的，是在保持中國法幣的固有價格，而而高過日圓，或日人用刺刀尖在佔據地區强迫行用倚賴日圓的任何新貨幣。這便是說，法幣仍可自由掉換外滙，而持有日圓或附屬日圓的貨幣者都不能享受這種重要便利。中國爲了保守這穩固原則，不得不把在外國售去國有白銀所得的外滙準備金首先犧牲了一大部分，即在此時，法幣依然可以掉換外匯。這些準備金的源源流出，（大都因爲拋空投機之故。）使法幣在耗費極巨的一年半戰爭期內逐漸地减低原値的半數；不過法幣雖跃價，牠把中國境內「日圓集團的」貨幣也拉低到同樣的程度。一般人却仍願行使中國法幣，牠的信用的堅强，流行的普遍，根基的鞏固，和未貶價以前全然相同</p>
<p>在一九三八年底，中日貨幣戰爭呈現膠着的狀態。中國仗了精明堅定的政策，已能使大見低落的外匯準備金减少流出，在若干月中流出之數，幾等於零。廣州武漢雖都陷落，中國雖未得外方金融上的援助，中國仍能使她的收入和外匯的義務相平衡。故中國能够繼續維持穩固的法幣，幾無窮期，一面父能推翻「日圓集團一的遠大計畫—至少在日本未籌得有效的新攻勢之際，這種情形必無變動。日本呢，一向只能踏着步子，處於守勢；這確然不是因爲她舊有的野心缺乏任何熱誠，却因爲她遭遇了重大的困難，迄今沒有克服的方法。</p>
<p>日圓的血刃與背景</p>
<p>同時，原來包括日本朝鮮台灣「滿洲國」關東租借地的「日圓集團」，已以有名無實的方法展至華北；又以更有名無實的狀態展至華中的日軍佔領地區；至於該集團展至華南，那是薄弱極了。日方從未發表這一舉動的實在程序，或實在條件，但將這事分析一下，可知牠的兩大目的和牠的目前發展狀况：（一）便利日本對軍事佔領區域輸出的擴張；（二）使日本得自由從這些區域輸入物品，而免有外滙的任何支出；這一着且可使日本可以將道些區域內的過剩物產在海外出售，所得的外匯，全數供她專用，至於地方上所受的損害，却置之不顧。日人所以要對這些區域實行貨幣的充分統制，不僅爲了要吿成道兩種目的，並且爲了借此可成一有力的槓杆，推動日本的一般經濟發展，那推動的方法，當然適合日本軍部的願望，和日本自己經濟的需要。</p>
<p>日本必須源源不絕地擴張她輸出的售賣，這是由於日本國內實行兩種彼此牴觸的政策所致：一種是限制而非增高她本國人民的購買力；一種是增高國內製造工業的產量，達到牠的技術能力的極度。日本輸出貿易的數量，近來的確有驚人的增長。自「滿洲事變」發生的一九三一年起，至中日戰事發生的前一年一九三六年止，這五年中增多足足百分之百。對外貿易的發達，其中至少一部分是由於削减售價而使國家作大犧牲才能得到。假使戰爭的準備並未吸收日本工業所增的出產，那未，日本國內購買力和日本工業所製造的貨物數量相距日遠的罅隙，仍不能因輸出售賣的增高而塡沒。軍事上和工業上的戰爭準備，且具借此以謀繼續增高輸出的目的。假使目前對華戰爭不能如預望得到在會經擴大的「日圓集團」內覔獲解決的結果，問題在將來更要跋重。就下述的情形觀來，日本藉奪取中國市塲以制勝輸出問題的機會，的確是很薄弱的，甚至想大大解除問題的困難，也不可得的。可是這種不利的氣象，却使日本添了一個圖將中國經濟隸屬（日圓集團的原因，以便在華遇到無論什麼貿易機會，便可盡力發展到極充分的可能程度。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c40">外滙平凖下之暗市匯價 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— 章榴</p>
<p>章榴先生係某經濟擊家之筆名，以熟悉金融市况受人器重，該文係對今後外滙暗市之一種有力的推測，關心本問題者希注意之</p>
<p>編者</p>
<p>一　外滙平凖基金與暗市</p>
<p>外滙平準基金委員會是在香港成立了，所謂平準基金，當然是平準法幣的滙價，但現在巾國實際上巳有兩個滙價，一是中央銀行掛牌的官價，一是暗市中的私價。那末，今後外滙平準基金實施平準的滙價，是官價呢私價呢？</p>
<p>從下面的理由上，我們假定今後實施平準的滙價，是私價，而不是官價。因爲</p>
<p>第一，中央銀行的匯價至今極穩定，照原</p>
<p>牌毫無變更，根本就用不着平準。况在幣制改革以來，政府在倫敦紐的，卽有平準基金的專款，暗市發生後，中國銀行又出而調整，（見宋子文氏談話）就當時的暗市滙價與後來滙價比較，可見中國外滙平準基金有盈無虧。也就是說中國的外滙基金，在戰後雖或沒有增加，但決不至受有損失，這樣自無補充外滙基金的必要，此决設置的基金，自然供平準暗市之用</p>
<p>第二，這是以暗市滙價存在而定。因爲暗市如果不存在，那末滙價只有一個，自然母須問他是平準那一個了。從實際上言，假定英美銀行有決心，肯帮中國國家銀行的忙，共同來消滅暗市，似乎並非沒有可能。旦是在現在市勢中，他們旣以八辦士可易得中國價値一元之商品，爲什麽一定要做一先令二辦士半的官價來交換的笨伯呢？</p>
<p>第三，設置外滙基金時倫敦方面發表談話，認爲對英國商業有利。而目前的各國貿易，差不多集中於暗市，是以所謂有利當然也指暗市。就委員銀行的地位說：匯豐麥加利是商業銀行。中交兩行雖與中央同以國家銀行系統見稱，在商業銀行中也佔重要地位，如果是平準官價，就不應沒有中央銀行在內。再决，就成立的地點說，如果他是中國的外滙機關，總樞紐應設在重慶，香港應爲辦事處，而此决外匯平準基金委員會，明明係倫敦發源，而置重心於香港，所以其平準目標也必在於穩定暗市，而便利中英貿易無疑。</p>
<p>二　九辦士乎八辦士乎</p>
<p>從有外滙暗市以來，市價大致一往直下，從最初的一先令二辦士半，降到最近的八辦士二五左右。其間却有一個特點，即最近三個月，市價特別顯示穩定。其穩定之趨勢，就經騐中觀察（一）遇有大最放出時，麥加利，滙豐兩行常爲吸收人，（二）遇頭寸非常緊湊時，麥加利匯豐兩行常爲供給人，（三）市價伸出八辦士二五以後，不久必重新回復到八辦士二五；而市價縮入八辦士二五，不久也必平衡在八辦士二五之上，從（一）（二）兩點來說，顯然滙豐麥加利兩行實際上已在負平準匯市的工作，從（三）點說，則顯然外滙暗市中的標準已安定在八辦士二五之上</p>
<p>等到外滙基金的消息傳出後，才知道麥加利滙豐兩銀行原是外匯平準基金委員會中之負責份子，則今後之暗市平衡標準究將如何？</p>
<p>（一）一說是抬到九辦士，理由是八辦士半或八辦士二五的滙價，跟法定官價相去過遠。上海洋商進出口商行，據傳曾要求以九辦士給予外滙。八辦士二五之水準，安定業有數月，如果驟然放長，必立即予金融市塲以收縮作用。所以就現率出發，把滙價抬到九辦士最有可能</p>
<p>（二）也有一說，以爲滙市不會動，將永遠安定在現價八辦士二五之上。理由以爲現價，業己安定數月之久，因滙價貶低所受之刺激，反予上海以提高物價的利益，發生了特殊景氣。各國如要支持貿易，就必須維持此種景氣存在，也就是必須維持低滙價的水準。</p>
<p>（三）更有一說，以爲外滙暗市在今後將無水準的上下，外滙委會之任務，固在安定外滙暗市，却不是供給外滙暗市。所以外滙委會對今後英國的正當貿易商，或者用一種津貼的方法，使英國商人能以九辦士的市價購得外滙，至其他商人，則置之不理。同時，對於暗市的外滙買賣，仍用「頭寸多時儘量吸入，頭寸少時，以一定限度放出」的方法來安定滙市。</p>
<p>上面三說，都有若干理由，也都有若干可能性。最近市勢還看不出，當局究將採取何種辦法。不過有幾點可以先決下來：第一，外滙暗市再縮下去大致是不可能的。第二，外匯基金委員會必將直接參加外滙暗市。或者用某種標準，却不一定維持某種標準。</p>
<p>三　暗市與官價之將來</p>
<p>早有人主張把官價貶低，換言之，是把官價撤消，而俯就暗市，這種主張固沒有實現，且不會實現；實現起來，在中國必有害而無利。如果把官價取消，無異在說明政府已沒有維持原匯價的誠意，同時，暗市中非正式的滙價，因取消了官價，無形中就予以合法的承認，所以事實上决不會實行的。</p>
<p>最後，就外滙平衡基金的本質來說，外滙平衡會維持暗價可取之處便極少。因爲外滙暗市之發生，由於中國管理外匯。如果使暗市能够予取予求，則何必在戰時管理外滙呢？</p>
<p>但轉過來說，對中國究竟是有利的。外匯平衡基金的增厚，是表示中國貨幣基礎日益鞏固；同時，該項委員會旣由巾英專家負責處理其事，當然不會給第三國利用。</p>

<h3 id="c41">「現代貨幣思潮及世界幣制趨勢」 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 姚慶三先生著　國民經濟研究所發行</p>
<p>我國素無健全幣制，有之應以新貨幣政策實施爲始。之前，囚國外銀價之暴漲暴跌，變幻莫測，我國經濟爲其左之右之，大受其苦，對於經濟學素無研究興趣之國人，獨對於貨幣問題，早爲朝野所重視。但能切實根據中國經濟實情，以謀解答貨幣學上一切問題，以淺見如余者，更覺其爲絕無僅有而引憾。</p>
<p>自法幣政策實施以來，縈繞於吾人腦際之懸案，雖已吿一段落，但此現代最進步之管理貨幣，已將世界貨幣學史，大爲改造。允自中日戰事發生以來，我國外滙竟能穩定至半年以上；雖自統制外滙後即發生暗市，甚至日方現在「華北」竟實行禁用法幣，但法幣流通上之信用，屹然不動，此中玄妙，益使國人對於貨幣學大感興趣。因此而益感應以本國實情闡明貨幣理論之必要。但能適應此項必要者，猶無所獲。</p>
<p>現得姚著「現代貨幣思潮及世界幣制趨勢」一書，雖係通論現代之貨幣思想及一般之貨幣制度，但已部份的根據中國之實情，而對貨幣理論，作深切之研討；從而發現現代之不少權威的貨幣學說，皆與我國之實情不符；甚至相反，如卡塞爾敎投Prof.　Cassle倡購貿力平價說，以爲物價漲跌同時，滙價必因而變動，以相關節。但姚氏根據近十年來我國匯價與物價之變動實情，發覺滙兌率之變動，輒在物價變動之後，故將此說修正爲「我國之購買力平價，實受滙率之支配，而非匯率受購買力平價之支配一，又如費歇敎授Prof.　Fihesr之稱貨數量說，亦爲一般解釋貨幣與物價關係者所樂用，以爲交易總量即使不變，但通貨數量變動時，物價必隨之變動。但經作者硏究我國近年之通貨與物價的實在情形，頗覺有因果倒置之事。且以爲「通貨數量之變動，亦不必與物價水準之變動相符合；縱令通貨數量之變動，與物價水準之變動，背道而馳；亦可由流通速率之變動而使貨物勞務交易之總値（PT），與一切交易之支付總額（　IV　　M'V'），在同一時期內趨於平衡」。購買力平價說與貨幣數量說之價値，原早爲世人所懐疑。然以中國之實情而作學術上之重估者，或已爲作者開其端矣。</p>
<p>惟該書之最大貢獻，尙在根據最新事實與統計，將現代一切貨幣思想，一一予以重新估價。使護者在學理上咸得正確之理解。此爲國人開闢一硏究歐美學術之門徑，此鬥徑爲何？即依吾人所處之環境，而予以判斷是也。</p>

<p>溫州·寗波·兩地前因海關查禁物品運滬、以致棉花·腸衣·絲繭·蛋品·茶葉·桐油·布疋等土貨滯積在兩埠者頗多、自經濟部公佈運滬查禁貨物審核辦法後、阻滯之土貨、均已由商會等保證、驗明先後放行、今該兩地已奉令設法疏散積貨、經兩地商會邀集各業集議後、決定（一）滯阻之土貨、盡量設法裝輪運出、（二）已運抵溫甬之進口貨、於短期內搬運至後方、</p>
<p>外商派輪裝運土貨</p>
<p>給核準行駛浙東溫州·寗波·兩口岸之外輪、如英商太古·意商中意·葡商美利·正德·美商華美·德商禮和·魯麟·等、均已派輪行駛滬溫滬甬及港甬港溫各航線、承裝溫甬兩地土貨出口、所以連日抵上海及香港之土貨頗多、溫甬兩地積貨、已逐漸減少、至於進口貨物、因浙贛湘桂直達車停駛、運往西南之貨物、均改道海防、因此各外商輪船去貨空前銳減</p>

<p>來源疏通　米價穩定</p>
<p>米糧評價委員會自評定米價為十四元、中次照別後、市場管理委員會切實執行限價、取締囤積居奇投機操縱、同時勸告販商顧全大局、盡量向產地採辦運滬接濟、今因內地米價、已回跌每石元許、販商運滬之米、雖無厚利、但不致虧耗、所以由內河及鐵路外輪運抵滬之米漸增、市場米價、得以穩定、一般囤戶、深恐為委員會查出受罰、相率出售、</p>
<p>存米共六十五萬包</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨晤米糧評價委員會委員張念萱氏、據談、關於公共租界及法租界內之存米、業已由本委員會派員詳查、但估計目前存米、總約六十五萬包、是項包子米、分一石二斗半及一石五斗·兩種、合計約八十萬石至九十五萬石之譜、連日雖因天雨關係、到滬稍減、預料天放晴後、即可增加、蘇州·無錫·嘉興·蕪湖·等處、均有國米運滬、</p>
<p>米號門售酌加佣金</p>
<p>米號業公會會員米號、依照公會議決案、自四月一日起、各號門售米價每石酌加佣金雜費四角、因各米號為維持限價、門售過去並不增加分文、以致均遭受虧折、今酌加佣金及雜費旨在維持血本、對於限價、並無影響、所以目前頭號白米、在市場上批發行市、雖為每擔十四元、而米號門售、則為每石十四元四角、但公會方面、認為門售行市、不能認為超過限價、</p>

<p>整個入超逐漸減少</p>
<p>全國對外貿易、向為入超、例如民國二十一年入超為八萬六千七百十九萬一千元、旋經政府竭力設法消除、於是逐漸減少、二十二年為七萬三千三百七十三萬九千元、二十三年為四萬九千四百四十五萬一千元、二十四年為三萬四千三百四十萬零二千元、二十五年為二萬三千五百八十萬零三千元、二十六年為一萬一千五百十三萬元、二十七年為一萬二千三百五十五萬八千元、但戰後二十六年九·十·十一·十二·四月、均為出超、自二十七年十月起、又變為入超</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>腎虧本是一種可壓的疾病，何況更因治不得法而變陰瘘，許多腎虧患者，以此病既難圓春閨好夢，生殖無望，患者往往得不到速治機會，急不擇藥，而購服春藥，此何異飲酖而止竭，其次市上又多效力薄弱的內分泌劑，空擲金錢，與病無補，故雖馬齒繼增，而膝下猶虛，此誠悲痛之至！</p>
<p>我們做醫生的人，對於這種人的治療，是非常為之小翼翼。第一得調查其病因，而且這種病都由自瀆　傷，或荒淫過度而來，因此青春腺無力振作，形成調零現象，致生理上所產生的血液呈枯竭不繼狀態，一方面不能刺戟性器而使之勃起，一方面因此而不能促進新陳代謝的機能，影響腦力與體力。此外又因睪丸中的精子稀少而脆弱，故雖有生育力健全的妻子，依然不克生子。故今鄭重地忠告不妊的夫婦們，若欲獲得子嗣以繞歡膝下者，宜在平時加以節慾，以免浪費精液，實為上策。</p>
<p>然而，此種方法，雖在應用上發生效力，但患有上述各症的丈夫不能調理痊癒，自然仍歸泡影！</p>
<p>近來，在我的醫院裏，應用著所謂睪丸內分泌的療法，就是用優良有睪丸精質製劑以補性力不足及生殖薄弱的人。結果，獲得非常美滿的效果，但必須服以真正從猩猩睪丸中抽出的精質製成的續質製的panticome「補體康」，方有名副其實之效驗，決不至於使服者失望的，餘前曾治癒一個久婚不育的夫婦，其經過頗有醫學上研究的價值，故特敘述如下：</p>
<p>患者是一個陰萎及神精衰弱者，經合理的治療後，並為內服「補體康」三月，上述症完全治好，然仍難護妊，旋乃診斷其妻，始知月經雖潮，因健康水平線低下，致其排卵期甚短，故事實上與精子相接機會甚少，因囑其妻內服女用「補體康」，結果健康進展，旋卒生一子。以此證之，則不論任何疾病，必須加以精密的診斷，實為必要！</p>

<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>治療肺病，其法甚多，而苦無一特效藥可以根治，伊古以來，乃不知有多少肺病患者犧牲於無特效藥一語之下。深為可悲！</p>
<p>近因科學發達，醫藥學均呈突飛猛進之勢，而肺病治療法，也有長足之進展。「補肺拿爾」一藥，即受科舉之推動力而發明者，此劑經世界各國名醫試驗，證明對於各期肺病，有短期奏效之功。因不論肺病已屆某一危險時期，服「補肺拿爾」，使患者本身發生抵抗結核菌之能力，並可使肺部空洞部分逐漸縮小。以至平伏如恆，因此該藥遂推為肺癆病內服藥中之祭酒，確非過譽之言。</p>

<p>患者趙進榮，二十三歲，江西峽江人，十六歲時，即犯自凟，後閱今古奇觀蔣興哥重會珍珠衫一段，不覺情不自禁，每於深夜人靜，自凟愈烈，如是以後，遺精滑精接踵而來，而自凟惡習尤不能戒絕，至今三載有餘，不僅面色蒼白，精神萎頓，而於白晝間亦有見色流精之象，去秋奉父母之命結婚，每行房事，必患早洩，腰酸背痛，病勢愈轉惡化。乞治云云。余乃囑其戒絕自凟之習，嚴守攝生，並令暫戒房事，每日電療十五分鍾，投以遺精專藥，「耐而斯遺精片」以止遺精滑精，又令購服德國睪丸內分泌劑男用「補體康」培補虧損，並治早洩，趙君遵余言而行，半個月後，遺精滑精全無，一個月後，已無早洩現象，而精神恢復，腰酸背痛亦愈，趙君鑒於「補體康」一藥卓效，故連服三月，至今健康恢復，面色紅潤，體重已增加九磅（診時體重衹一百零二磅）</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>淋毒與婚姻之幸福，有著極大之關係，因無人不知淋毒為一極富於傳染之淋毒，故如已結婚之男子，不幸而為淋毒所傳染者，最佳於治癒時始可同衾合枕，否則，如妻子一朝被染此毒，則將輾轉傳染，而使妻子的白帶淋漓，浸潤膣道，刺痛異常。一方又因淋毒而致絕孕，發生雙方感情上之破裂，更加雙倍之痛苦。但如果短期內不為之治愈，則男子勢亦必難長期禁慾。</p>
<p>花柳病的患者，我們不必拿什麼「道德」兩個字眼去譴責他，我們是醫家，是解決人家痛苦的醫家，應該談談一些有效的切實療法，並切應該考察花柳病的社會上的原因。</p>
<p>從各個醫學者上的統計，知道花柳病的患者，以淋毒患者占最多數，原來淋毒治癒極為不易，若誤服一般市上成藥，致病與藥不相對症，結果非但無益，反而有害。如淋毒患者，因此而腐蝕其關節，成為癱瘓殘廢之人，因淋菌並不是僅留居於局部尿道粘膜上的，乃是散處於體內深部組織及血液中，所以治療必須徹底，男子患了淋病，睪丸先被損壞，女子患了淋病，卵巢即行毀傷，因此之故，男子的輸精管，和女子的輸卵管，都因發炎而致阻塞，永不能受孕。</p>
<p>為速行撲滅此兩性將來不幸之慘劇起見，可服用德國淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，因此劑為蛋白體黃色素混合製成，服後能使用細胞發生抗淋病噬菌之偉大功效，故為一般淋病患者所最賞用的。凡一切新老白濁，只要服用「克淋儂」後數小時，即發生上述種種效力。將流散血液等處的淋菌，徹底掃蕩，再男子外用「抗淋水」女子外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，如此在急性淋時可三星期治癒，慢性時期在五星期，無不收根治之效。如已結婚夫婦同患淋病者，可同時治療，以免輾轉傳染，而收十全之效。此為余多年來實地之經驗。</p>

<p>輸精管之被侵</p>
<p>輸精管是握著生殖機能極大的權力。假如無此器官，或此器官被外界之細菌所侵襲，則此管腔內炎症之發生，而腫大閉塞，所以生殖自然陷於絕望，而且當淋病患者發生輸精管炎時，尿道內恆有如螞蟻咬一樣的痛苦，尤其是肛門與會陰等處，脹痛如裂，小便艱窘，努責之後，始有微量之尿液排出，但亦有不少之膿血相混，小腹亦加疝痛，此時如果用Ｘ光線照映之，必更能證明患者之輸精管腫大逾恒，這樣如不從速治療，當然要失去牠的生殖力了。</p>
<p>治騐案的示例</p>
<p>前有患者龔小栱君，年念八歲，因其平生好運動，馳馬掣劍，素稱能手，自患淋病之後，除因急性淋時，不得不略事休養外，一過急性淋時期，又故態復萌，蓋龔君之病，在急性淋時誤遇庸手，再誤於劣藥，蹉跎一載有餘，故改變此疾患也。余乃為之使用德國靜電療法，及Ｘ線交相為用，同時又用淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，作為內服劑，使其殺菌功效，集中病灶，所以於二星期內。輸精管之炎腫已消，繼續治至五星期，此種痛苦不堪之淋病，徹底治癒！去年與王媚菊女士結婚，生活極為和諧云</p>

<h3 id="c77">弁言 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 陳鶴琴</p>
<p>四月四日是我們中華民國的兒童節，國家所以要規定兒童節，是有偉大的意義，我們應當深切的認識，盡力推行，使兒童節的紀念，普及全國各地，全國的兒童都快快樂樂過此慶祝節，使他們明瞭自己在人類歷史中所負的責任和使命，才會努力奮鬥，才會改造現社會，建設新國家。</p>
<p>今天的兒童，就是將來國家的主人翁，古人說：「後生可畏一，西哲也說：」「國家文明的進步，隨着兒童的脚跟一·這都是說明兒童是國家的寳貝，民族的生命，文明的基石，我們對於現代兒童，實有無上的希望。</p>
<p>慶祝兒童節，我們要使一切兒童—幸福的和不幸福的—都得到幸福，所謂幸福兒童，我們檢査他們所得到的幸福當中，也許還有許多不幸福的地方，就家庭方面說，家庭的環境，應該盡量含有敎育的意義，打破兒童養尊處優的習慣，養成兒童一們在家庭中自動學習自動硏究及參加家庭工作如燒飯，洗衣，掃地等勞動習慣。</p>
<p>就學校方面說，死的書本知識不够，敬愛的敎師應該處處爲兒童着想，多補充一些活的敎材，呆板的敎學法可以改得活潑一些，避免注入式的方法，採用討論和硏究的方法，讓兒童可以多呼吸一些自由的空氣。</p>
<p>慶祝兒童節，單就所謂幸福的兒童講，値得敎師們家長們注意和硏究兒童眞正的幸福問題。至於成千成萬不幸的兒童，我們要用一切力量來使他們得到幸福。鼓勵兒童帮助兒童，動員成人帮助兒童。爲不幸的兒童謀幸福，應該多舉辦兒童事業，如推進難冀敎育，設立報童學校，成立丐童敎養院，組織童工敎護委員會，設立學徒學校，設立兒童法庭等，這些都是爲不幸兒童謀幸福的具體工作，籌備會除臨時慶祝的工作而外，還計劃作幾件永久事業，以資紀念，希望各界熱心人士起來贊助。則兒童幸福，國家興隆，民族光榮，實利賴之。</p>
<h3 id="c78">從兒童節說到難童敎育之重要 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 陳濟成</p>
<p>我國舉行兒童節，已第八屆矣。</p>
<p>兒童節舉行之意義，不僅欲鼓舞兒童興趣啟發兒童愛羣愛國愛家庭之心理，並欲喚起社會對於兒童事業之注意。所謂兒童事業，其在平時爲兒童之保健娛樂，虐待防止，以及特殊兒童之敎育，流浪兒童之處置等等。我人務必審愼計劃，努力推進，今者國危家亡，哀鴻遍野，滬地形成孤島，託庇以安難童麕集數逾十萬。其敎其養，尙能兼籌並顧，决第施行。苟一出禁戒綫外，則足跡所至，耳目所及，五尺之童，莫不失學。倘戰事一日不止，則此輩一日不得受敎，年復一年，轉瞬學齡已過，則蠢蠢之衆，皆爲社會中堅，言之可慨！至於窮荒僻壤牛民兒童，更有不僅失學，且又失養者生命，尙不能保，何遑受敎。惟兒童事業，乃建國事業，欲建健全之國家，須有健全之國民，欲求健全之國民，不可不先培植健全之兒童。故救濟難童，比救濟難民爲要；而敎育難童，比救濟難竄爲更要。泰西各國，從事敎育諸人，莫不致力於孤貧兒童之敎育，若法蘭西在伯拉與養女洛易塞布蘭爾之設立農村託兒所，若瑞士裴斯塔羅齊之設立孤兒院，若英吉利巴托在維思之在蘇格蘭巴拉那地方，設立敎育該地工人子女之保育所，若德意志福祿培爾之受瑞士政府之聘任布爾德爾福孤兒院院長，若意大利蒙台梭利之曾任羅馬市慈善團體所發起之貧兒學校，監督其事業，皆彰彰在人耳目。其中如裝斯塔羅齊目擊斯塔基地方兵災慘重，孤兒流連過多，乃賃一寺院收容蒙難兒童八十餘人，施以孤兒敎育，雖因孤兒之疾病惡習及校舍之不備，外界之誤會，致迭生困難，然能以至純之愛與犧牲之精神感格，一切不及半年，卒能收最大之效，此允足爲我人舉辦難童敎育絕好之模範。我國古時，越王勾踐，十年生聚，十年敎訓，德國斐希德氏主張復興，德國先從培養優良國民種子入手，難童敎育之重要，蓋亦可以深長思之矣！</p>
<p>上海第八屆慶祝兒童節　功參化育</p>
<p>— 周邦俊題</p>
<h3 id="c79">兒童節敬吿兒童之父兄與師長 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 吳志騫</p>
<p>際此第八屆兒童節，環顧國中，河山變色，風景全非，新亭之淚，何能自已，而我中華國運所寄託與最有希望之兒童，在此連天砲火聲中，度其最有價值之兒童佳節，斯誠最堪欣幸之事，余雖欲嘿無一言，其可得乎。</p>
<p>我以爲在此非常時期，我人之所期望於兒童者，比平時爲更切，父兄之詔勉其子弟，師長之啟迪其學生，亦應較平時爲更重要，此我所以際此佳節而不得不爲兒童之父兄師長敬吿一言也。</p>
<p>我之欲爲兒童父兄吿者，家庭敎育應與學校敎育同時並進，爲父兄者不可將子弟送進學校，即爲己盡已責，允應在家庭之間，敎以動作進退言語酬酢等等各種禮儀，而於待人接物之道，更應切實指導，以養成其優良之品性。所謂入則孝出則悌，原爲古聖賢敎人立身之大道，而今日之子弟，大都視爲陳言腐語。莫有遵行者矣，此爲父兄者所亟應闡明指導者也。</p>
<p>我之欲爲兒童師長吿者，兒童之入學校爲求學問智識也，爲師長者除授以課本上之學識外，更應外察大勢，內審國情，使兒童充分明瞭國家之地位，與夫國際間之狀况，以啟發其愛國之心，幷須鍛鍊其體格，養成尙武之風，庶幾將來能爲捍衛國家之用，此爲師長者應有之責也。</p>
<p>其次更欲爲兒童本身吿，汝等生長在此大時代，良非偶然，汝等在此求學之年，一宜用心於功課，以求學識之豐富，二宜注重於體格，以求身體之健全，將來學成之後，即可担當國家之事業，爲我國揚眉吐氣，汝等須知我國數十年來，所受之奇恥大辱。均待汝等爲之湔雪，汝等所負之使命甚大，不可不刻苦自勉，以無負生長在此大時代中也。</p>
<p>佳節欣逢，無以爲祝，撮舉三點，藉以互勉，若以爲老生常談，則我豈敢。</p>
<h3 id="c80">兒童玩具與兒童敎育 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 邵鳴九</p>
<p>兒童是民族的基礎，要想民族優良强盛，必先耍培養優良健全的兒童。</p>
<p>以兒竄爲本位的敎育，近幾年來才在中國倡行，兒童才開始爲人們所注意，於是在敎育方面，則以適應兒童的興趣，兒童的需要爲實施的原則；書局方面，發行兒童文庫，幼童文庫；報紙方面，有兒童敎育新聞，兒童畫報；社會方面，有慈幼協會，上海兒童保育會，中華兒童用品社等組織。並規定兒童節，兒童年，以示鄭重提倡。爲着我們民族的前途，爲着我們兒童的幸運，這眞是値得慶欣的一件事。</p>
<p>硏究兒童敎育者，誰都知道兒童的天性是愛好遊戲的，所以敎育也該從兒童的遊戲中去着手實施。而遊戲時所用的工具，便是兒童的玩具。因此兒童的玩具，間接地也便成了兒童敎育實施的工具。不但在理論上是如此，就是在事實的表現上，也證明了玩具在兒童敎育上是佔着很大的勢力。</p>
<p>兒童的玩具，在兒童的敎育上旣顯示得這樣的重要，那麼我們對於兒童的玩具，當如何的留意呢？我以爲在消極方面，要積極的盡力取締不良的兒童玩具，因爲不良玩具之影嚮於兒童，比不良書本影響於兒童還大。其原因就是玩具容易發生興趣，所以給予兒窒的印像，比書本上所得的印像要來得深刻些。至於取締的方法，則必須從家庭學校和社會三方面共同努力進行，才能收到效果。</p>
<p>（一）家庭方面</p>
<p>因爲兒童在家庭中的時間最長，玩的時候當然也更多，如果不有些東西供給他們遊戲，勢必使兒童終日乾燥無味，或鬧得到處不安。可是如果不加選擇，一遇不良的玩具，即易養成其不良的習慣。例如有些家庭，常令兒童以賭具爲遊戲。此種賭博的玩具，給予兒童的影響，至爲深刻，將來卽欲以敎育的力量去糾正，都難發生較大的效力，應該絕對的禁止與兒童接近。</p>
<p>（二）學校方面</p>
<p>學校是兒童的第二家庭，兒童除去在家庭的時間外，大部分的時間都是在學校中度過的。當然我相信在每個學校所設備的兒童玩具，決不會有什麽不良的，不過有些學校因爲設備的簡單，或學生人數太多，不易管理，常常也會由兒童自己帶些不良的玩具到學校來玩，或自己尋找些玩具，作無意識的遊戲。這種地方，負有兒童敎育責任的人，應該加以特別注意。</p>
<p>（三）社會方面</p>
<p>兒童除去家庭和學校活動之外，有時也和社會環境接觸，社會上各種專爲引誘兒童的遊戲或玩具，不勝枚舉。兒童常爲好奇心所激蕩，自然而然的，會去接近他。例如街坊小攤上之轉彩摸紙牌，擲骰子等遊戲，不止以兒童爲營利的對象，而且是給予兒童種種惡影響，養成種種惡習慣。此種玩具和遊戲，應該加以切實的取締。共力量則有賴於敎育行政當局了。</p>
<p>總之，凡耗財費時而與兒童心身毫無裨益的遊戲工具皆當設法取締，同時另一方面，我們還要積極的提倡能啟發民族思想，有益於社會建設，切合兒童身心發達的玩具。以樹立民族優良健全之基礎，其方法，亦可由家庭，學校，社會三方面去努力提倡推行，工欲善其事，必先利其器，願關心兒童敎育者，能注意及此。</p>

<p>— 陳征帆</p>
<p>（一）上海工部局兒童保障科</p>
<p>上海工部局兒童保障科成立於一九三八年十二月，由邢德女士（Fleanor　M.　Hinder）主持辦理；協助者爲吉志廷及其他對於社會調查與處理個案具有豐富經騐之社會服務人員。該科設立之目的，在對於被非直系親屬領養而受虐待及剝削之兒童及少年，提供適當而迅速之保障。該科長除進行保障一般兒童外，對於保護婢女問題，更加以最大之注意。工部局董事會會通過保護原則二項：（一）本局應依照其他地方所日漸發展之觀念，對於婢女身份，或任何類似奴隸之身份，概不承認。（此項原則，含有不應將婢女另行登記之意。）（二）本局叉應如其他地方之鄭重注意，對於被轉讓之兒童及少年，務應用一切可能方法，使將此項轉讓事件向本局主管人員報吿，並設法保護被轉讓人，藉以表示本局之責任心。</p>
<p>兒童保障科對於上海各慈幼機關均發生關係，維持密切之聯絡。凡經由法院發交各慈幼機關之兒童，各該慈幼機關應於每月塡具報吿，寄予兒童保障科參玫。除非與兒童保障科商酌並獲得同意，任何慈幼機關不得將法院發交兒童送往工廠，或允人領養，或爲擇配，或以其他方法處置之。</p>
<p>（二）中華慈幼協會上海辦事處</p>
<p>中華慈幼恊會以推進全國兒童福利爲宗旨；全面抗戰發生後，爲辦理救濟工作利便計，該總會遷設重慶，在上海改設辦專處（地址在愛多亞路中滙大樓二〇八號）。該處之負責人，爲林康侯，趙晋卿，吳維德等。其全部事務，分爲救濟，保障，衛生，敎育等項。廿七年度內，該處共救護兒童一千八百五十七名；除安置者外，尙餘留兒童八百九十五名，仍在繼續收容中。其他，又辦理虐待兒童案件，爲兒童診病，舉行健康比賽等。</p>
<p>上海之慈幼機關林立，彼此甚缺少認識及聯絡機會。據筆者所知，慈幼協會上海辦事處已派員研究該項問題，希望發現最適當之解決方法。</p>
<p>（三）上海兒童保育會</p>
<p>上海兒童保育會成立於廿七年六月六日，理事長爲陳鶴琴，陳濟成，黃定慧等，負責人爲吳志騫，趙一葦，邵鳴九等。其宗旨：「採取最經濟，最迅速，最持久之方法，力謀保育兒童，以養成中華民國之健全國民。」所有工作，分爲五項：（一）硏究兒童保育事業，（二）舉辦兒童保育事業，（三）聯絡或協助兒童保育之機關團體，（四）培養兒童保育人才，（五）編輯兒童保育材料。</p>
<p>由成立迄今，兒童保育會已設立報童學校十四所，共敎育報童六百餘名。該項報童學校，擬再設立十所，使全市報童，均享受敎育機會。此外，又準備組織童工敎護委員會，協助工廠改善童工生活，推進童工敎育，設立丐童敎養院，收容全市丐童，予以敎育機會及生產訓練。</p>

<h3 id="c88">中國無「排外運動」 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>至少在現在，中國沒有排外運動，只有抗敵運動。凡是以友邦待我們的外國，我們也以友邦待她，歡迎之不暇，絕對沒有排斥的道理。若是存心侵略我們的外國，或者正在侵略我們的外國，則我們必誓死抵抗，豈但排斥而一！</p>
<p>據最近大陸報和一般內地來的消息說，有許多華字報紙，居然在表示中國人的排外，允其排英，而此項傳單標語，也應有盡有，情况似乎很熱烈。這種滑稽劇，不必說明眼人，就是三尺童子，也知道牠的來源，還不是我們的敵人在弄的鬼？說破了眞正不值一笑！</p>
<p>因此我希望我們的友邦，允其英國，一些不要相信中國在排外，這不過是我們的敵人，用假借民意的方式，壓迫他們的傀儡玩出來的把戲；而這些傀儡呢，本來已自絕於其同胞，算不來中國人，更不能代表中國。</p>
<p>同時，我希望我們在游擊區內的同胞確實認淸楚友與敵的區別，旣不會受敵人小信小惠的蠱惑，將敵作友，更不會受敵入這種毒性的宣傳，將友作敵。總之，援助我們的是我們的友，侵略我們的是我們的敵。至於何者爲援助，何者爲侵略，則眼前的事實很多，處處可以證明，也就不必我來多所說明了。</p>
<p>看到敵人這一種手法，自然會使我們知道敵人的用意所在。他們要逐出在中國的所有外國人，由他們稱心如意地獨佔着，當然爲他們應有的目的。然而他們避不出面，嗾使他們的傀儡，出而在吠，諉爲中國人的「自動，」這樣的計劃，則允其狡而且毒。因爲他們想這樣一來，他們旣可以避免責任，而我們的友邦，也許竟會因此引起誤會，懐恨我們，不來援助我們了。不過這一個計劃的當然不生效力，是無可諱言的，而其卑鄙無恥的程度，則眞使人舌撟不下。</p>
<p>因此，我們不排外；我們只抗敵；我們允其不排援助我們的外，而允其要抗誣蔑我們排外的敵！</p>
<h3 id="c89">離開了宋莊 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>——徐州突圍回憶記</p>
<p>從禹王山撤退下來時，命令上說是要退守鳳凰山，扒頭山，宿羊山的，不想到宋莊休息了兩天，又一個命令傳了來：退守雲龍山！</p>
<p>雲龍山在什麽地方呢？據說是在徐州。那時，敵人已悄悄的從蒙城、永城之間竄到隴海路上，將黃口鐵橋炸斷，正向徐州包圍了來……</p>
<p>但我們不相信徐州就會失去的，以前由平漢路轉隴海路，經過徐州到台兒莊來時，我們對徐州只有隨便認識了一眼，便匆匆分別了，現在聽到了要退守雲龍山的命令，我們都很高興！因爲我們又可以到徐州耍去了。但同時，叉感到有些悲酸：這許多土地，這許多麥子，將要給敵人的鐵蹄來踐踏了！</p>
<p>帶着無限惜別的情意，在一天夜裏，在宋莊的老百姓的熟睡中，悄悄的離開宋莊向徐州出發了。</p>
<p>人，一個跟一個的急急的只是走着，騎兵安逸的。騎在雄健的馬身上，半跑着搶到前面去，那用八匹大騾子拉着的重砲，慢吞呑的在隊伍的後面滾動着，黃灰可怕的向着人的鼻孔裏相嘴裏續，使人感到有些窒息。</p>
<p>拉軍用品的貨車，不時吱吱的呌着從後面趕了來，那强烈的燈光，使人不敢回過頭去對牠看一看，只得站在路旁讓牠過去了，便嗆在那灰塵裏追趕上前面的隊伍去。</p>
<p>天上點綴着無數亮晶品的星星，大地是那末黑沉沉的，白犬給微風撫摸着，活潑的在田野裏輕搖着的那一片極目無邊的麥子，已被黑暗呑蝕去了。樹呈現出一團黑影，像一個巨人似的矗立着。帶着幾分寒氣的夜風，不時向着人吹來，使人感到有些冷！</p>
<p>遠近的村落裏，常給人馬的脚步聲引來了一陣陣的狗吠聲，除此，便一點聲音也沒有，什麼都是這末靜靜的。</p>
<p>無盡的隊伍，像一條黑流似的，默默的只是在北方的那廣大的原野裏洶湧的流着，沒有停息，彷彿都是一些鐵鑄的人馬，永遠不會疲倦似的。</p>
<p>到了天亮，爲躲避敵人的飛機，便停在一個只有四五家人，但人已跑空了的呌做黃光的小村荘裏裏休息着。到了黃昏，隊伍便沿着那浮着三四寸深黃灰的公路繼續前進。</p>
<p>拍！拍……忽然前面傳來了一陣淸脆的槍聲，接着越來越密，在那亂紛紛的槍聲裹，砲聲也宏亮的在響着，不久，前面便浮起了一個通紅的火光，把天空都映得那麽火紅紅的。</p>
<p>「這是什麽事？」</p>
<p>「大概是同敵人接觸了！」</p>
<p>但完全不像同敵人接觸的樣子，隊伍沒有一點懼怕的依然前進着，子彈鳴嗚的呌着從身旁掠過去。</p>
<p>轟隆！突然一個像閃電似的紅光，隨着一聲驚人的爆炸聲，亮了起來，把附近被黑暗籠罩着的村莊，都照得那末淸淸楚楚的，這使我們不禁驚異的呌了一聲，不由自主的趕快把頭縮了下去：</p>
<p>「這是幹什麼事情呢？」</p>
<p>沒有人知道。大家懐着一顆緊張的心，機械的只是跟着走着，但不久一個消息從前面傳了過來：這是奉令撤退的一枝友軍，在隴海路的大許家車站，將無法帶走的軍火自動焚毀的。這雖然是沒有辦法的事情，這雖然破壊了隴海路，使從邳縣南下的敵軍，不能沿鐵路綫前進，但想到那用老百姓的血汗換來的子彈，不能一顆顆打進敵人的胸膛裏，我們都感到一種難說的痛心！</p>
<p>一些不知什麽地方壊了的汽車被扔棄在路旁沒有人管着，拖軍用品累死了的馬牛，蒙着一身黃灰躺在公路上，使人感到一種凄然：連馬牛都走死了，難道我們的這兩隻脚會抵得過馬牛的嗎；不過我們到底不是馬牛，走！走！走！</p>
<p>不停的走着，一速兩夜沒有得睡過的眼睛，就好像有什麽東西壓在那眼皮上似的，那眼皮時時只是想閉攏，頭是那末昏沉沉的，已經是在一種半睡眠的狀態裏，但是我們的腦筋是淸醒的，我們還是警戒着。</p>
<p>到了東方吐出朦朧的晨曦時，我們好容易到了宿營地——佟村了。</p>
<h3 id="c90">沙漠中的旅人 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 柳攸</p>
<p>這裏不是深山僻野，也不是在洋大海，這是茫茫一地一片，無數黃沙堆積成的大沙漠。</p>
<p>千里，萬里，見不着去路，顧不到盡頭，所見的是陰曇的天空，縱橫無邊際的沙土，見不到可愛的悅目的靑色綠色，感不到蓬勃的生氣。</p>
<p>終年是那麽沉靜，沒有半點兒人烟，無此的凄凉，這沙漠阻止了人們的去路，好似一座聳入雲霄的巍峨峻嶺，走不過去，跳不過去，飛也不能過去！</p>
<p>渡過一條大江，跨過一片大海，不需什麽力量，可是，越過這茫茫的沙漠，却耍有若偉大的毅力！</p>
<p>沙漠間，誰也不敢深入；惟有那苦鬥的英雄，和他們的忠實的旅伴—駱駝，以超越的精神，路過這荒凉的世界！</p>
<p>沒有日光，沒有水，更沒有憇息的地方，祗有艱苦地前進，忍耐着飢渴！</p>
<p>那一陣旋風，捲起了沙士，使旅人迷失了路途，可是這不給他們絲毫畏懼，他們停留了片刻，振起精神，重向前進！</p>
<p>茫茫的一片，經過了無限的時候，還沒有到達目的地，可是，他們不會氣餒，仍然慢慢地進行。他們知道：有一天，他們跳出死一般的世界，踏上「成功」之途！</p>
<h3 id="c91">生命的血酒 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 梅依白</p>
<p>『飮我以生命的血酒，還我以自由與光明。』</p>
<p>我要跳，我要號呌，我要痛哭，不；我快要瘋了。</p>
<p>週圍是漆黑的一片，看不見天日也沒有一些光明，甚至一顆星星。</p>
<p>人說春天已經來了，然而我看不見，是被高大的建築物遮掩了嗎？是被砲火唬走了嗎？也許給掩埋在瓦礫堆裹了。啊！春在那裏呢。</p>
<p>我愛自由，但偏有人不許你自由，你要懸掛國旗嗎？他們會呌你撤下，你愛你的國家嗎？也許有人會干涉你。啊！你是沒有自由的，知道嗎？</p>
<p>看幽靈的生物，他們歡笑，他們歌舞；他們出賣靈魂，出賣一切。</p>
<p>任何事情都圍繞着你，黑暗向你侵襲，恐怖向你突擊，利祿向你引誘。使你呼吸窒息，使你忿怒，使你厭惡。</p>
<p>這是孤島！沒有自由，沒有光明，不許你動，祇有安分守已的做一個人。</p>
<p>給我以生命的血酒吧，因爲我太苦悶了。</p>
<h3 id="c92">飲食·男女·起居· <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>這幾個禮拜，忙着寄航空信。信是用專電式的措辭，總算不滿一紙便了之；而信外附去的東西，那就無法縮短，夜長夢多，因此，郵票一層，就化得可觀。爲了自己沒有坐過飛機，而寄託精神的東西，能彀有機會「乘長風破浪三千」，倒也感覺到一種平凡生活上的新鮮味。飄飄然，滿天星斗，行文太上，就是飛機再要失事，倒也落得個名副其實的「落花水面皆文章」了！</p>
<p>因爲這，我就想起一點人生問題來。哪！又來了！人生，人生不得，當一鼓作氣抗戰的時候，朋友！異端之耗，要洩氣的。且夫疏散人口，也就所以「陳力就列」也。個人的子彈和集團的子彈，一樣不講究人生，焉用佞！偃武修文之後再來吧！</p>
<p>於是我想起開槍還得要瞄準，而瞄準者，無非是爲「認淸敵人」瞄而不準，敵人在你的槍口上「打哈哈」；道件事，自然不是我道樣從未奔赴戎機者所可說得明白的。</p>
<p>且說——道「且說」很有理由，而不用話分兩頭，原來「抗戰高於一切」，只有這一頭去迎頭，已經够了。然而住在這個旣不是前方，又不是後方，一半像「鈹金城」，一半像「象牙塔」裏的「明眸皓齒」，有些時候還來一陣義義憤填膺的溫柔愛國風雅抗戰的仕女，委實可以寒心！</p>
<p>人之忙，簡直可說沒有空閒的時問了。一些事弄完了，父有一些來；又有的完了，叉之又又，又得蒼蒼者化而爲白，動搖者或脫而落，而且還有一些旣無明令委派，又不是要的方式規定的不是職務的職務：飲食，男女，起居等等「軋鬧猛」於其間，弄得一個人除了談談愛（國）與抗（敵）之外，不得不身體力行於飮食男女起居之間，道一個方面，孤島上的士夫及其相手方諸色人等，最能勝任愉快，有人呌做「紅血的開心」！「不到黃河心不死，到了黃河又想跨過去」，這才是慾海滔天，無可救藥！</p>
<p>飲食，男女，起居，人之大慾存焉！古人說的「食色性也」，就是今人的吃飯，戀愛，睏覺，少一件也不會來的。</p>
<p>郁達夫先生以爲「朱門酒肉臭，野有凍死骨，所以要階級鬥爭，一邊是後宮佳麗三千，盡日君王看不足，一邊是石壕村裏夫妻別，夫戍蕭關妾在吳，所以要革命，」——接着他又說明：</p>
<p>「然而食色兩慾，因爲是基本的慾望，滿足滿足是非常容易的。仟你是一個怎樣的大食家，只敎有斗酒隻鷄，三碗白飯，一個大餅，總也可以打得倒了。吃飽之後，就是你再請客，再也吃不下去的。至於色字，無論怎樣的精力家，最多十個女人也就可以對付了罷，經過十個女人之後，就是西施太眞，再也挑不起性慾來了。」</p>
<p>這似乎解決了一部份人生的慾念了，原來也不必往下再說。</p>
<p>然而，「吃飽飯之後，你當做他們去愛國嗎！「再也挑不起性慾」之後，你當做他們去抵抗或踏上救亡陣綫嗎？沒有，沒有，卑之母甚高論！自從有了梁啟超設計過的那架「造糞機器」之後；自從扁鵲說過「精生則體固一之後；自從「環境關係一之後；自從假借「後方一名義之後；自從現在暫不做漢奸之後；自從「自己人有啥話頭，要上同××人去上」說來頭頭是道，恰巧合符民族高於一切的最高原理之後，這才掩旗息鼓，大家團團圍住飮食，男女，起居之間，人生行樂耳。</p>
<p>大幅的廣吿，大批的蠕蠕顫動的行人，立體的建築，櫃窗的設計，這一切都努力地替本文做註脚，局部的負責舉證出來。</p>
<p>我不明白社會問各個羣的心理，所以說來都是不中聽的話。誰又能够離開白飯，男女，睏覺呢？</p>
<p>惟其不能離開，所以過去掀動政潮來做公債買賣，現在國難臨頭，也有難財可發，至於尅扣難糧，嚇禁聲張，弄點外滙化頭，飽滿私囊，然後大慾八八六十四卦，卦卦皆通。</p>
<p>曹聚仁先生曾經把漢奸和傀儡分辨出一個界說。眼前看到的這一班人，大槪不大會個個都去做漢奸，不過當傀儡，好像有可能的因素包含其間。</p>
<p>到了那個時候，於是飮食，男女，起居之後，又有一重「環境壓迫」，出於萬不得已的新理由產生了，則我們一羣在筆頭上趕着無事忙的朋友，也終於覺得徒然！</p>

<h3 id="c93">上海之新藥業  孫籌成 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>藥以治病，本無所謂新舊。現在之所謂新藥者，別於數千年來專用原質，不加精製之國藥而言。此項名稱，係新藥界先進餘姚黃楚九先生所訂定，因民國十六年國民革命軍底定東南，各大藥房合組同業公會時，黃先生以近來藥房內所售各種藥品間有中藥原料東藥名詞雜其中，原稱西藥二字，似不足以包括完全；况內務部已將西醫改爲新醫，則西藥亦應改爲新藥，提出討論，衆皆贊同而遂決定。蓋我國自神農嘗百草以來迄今數千年，所有藥品，以質地言，大都草木蟲石；以製法言，不外炒炙蒸浸，臨時水煎，量多味苦，病者胃口薄弱，吞服不便，不若西藥之化騐提煉，取共精英，去其糟粕，量少力宏，美觀而易服也。此西藥之所以能乘間輸入，而奪我利權。有識之士，鑒於科學昌明，民衆信仰西藥之心理日盛，苟不設法補救，則利權外溢，與國計民生頗有關係，故皆移轉目光，竭力仿製，冀塞漏卮，此亦提倡國貨聲中之好消息。上海爲通商鉅埠，藥房藥廠較各省市特多，且內地藥房所售之貨，大都批自上海，所以上海之新藥　，執全國之牛耳，全國新藥業同業公會聯合會亦設於上海。衛生署對於管狎藥商所訂規程，亦請該會推派代表，參加意見，以冀使於推行也。現在已加入上海市新藥業同業公會者計有一百另八家，名稱分藥房、藥行藥廠三種，組織有獨資、兩合股份之別。門市批發並重者計有五洲、中法、中西、中英、華美、華洋、華英、南洋、集成、太和、愛華、新華、寳華、天華、大陸、大華、大生、萬國、公達、正威、宏興、佛慈、濟倉、永和、濟華堂、太平洋、聯昌德、衛爾康等廿八家；偏重枇發者，　有新亞、信誼、羅威、正德、九福、九能、丹維、父子、大中、大夏大隆、華勝、華孚、華羅、勤康、滙康、中華、中國、元下、仁壽、好友、好來、百靈、百中、海普、立達、同仁、志樂、靑成、沛記、金龍、科達、威靈、美利、泰和、泰信、亞美、亞洲、國泰、國民、新星、新一、新生新康、會豐、福豐、福爾、德華、耀華、履瀛、萬國、永信·復康·振業·致德、柯爾登、海彌登、拜樂登、美林登、頣恩氏、司登氏、悅軒齋、安立思、哈巴特、奇默克、華興昌等六十六家；偏重門市者，計有世界、中和、中歐、中德、明華、翔華、東方、束南、寳德、華德、華成、天一、崇濟、大生堂等十四家。相互合作，日求進步，其他未入會者，除先施永安新新大新四公司西藥部外，尙有利濟、國泰、屈臣氏、老德記等數十家。對於會內所定之業規，按照部頒章程，亦須遵守。年來因自製之新藥，功效能與同性質之舶來品並駕齊驅，而價格則低廉多矣。故外貨銷路日减，每年挽回利權不少。以民國二十七年度營業而言，大槪批發方面，因交通不便，運輸困難，淪陷區域內，人民窮苦，購買力薄弱，商業不振，所以較戰事未發生以前减色；間有數家所出之品，係家居旅行所必需備，而便於携帶者，則銷路未减，此係例外。門市方面，因滬上人口激增，且各處來滬之人，大都輾轉逃避，飽經風霜，備受艱辛，一遇感冒，容易患病，故銷路反比前年八一三以前增加；而外滙緊縮，原料飛漲，存貨較多者，獲利較厚。外埠藥房受戰事影響，關閉日多，去年八一三以後，雖改爲現款交易，但八一三以前所放之賬，則無法收回，吃虧甚大。通盤計算，因貨價提高關係，二十七年全年之營業，以出品之數量言，較前年少；以進出之貨款言，較前年多，各家均有盈餘，惟多寡須視其存貨充足與吾而定高下耳。</p>
<h3 id="c94">上海最近之建築業　唐澤南　山睛甫 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>溯自八一三戰事發生，虹口南市諸區民衆多數避入租界，於是租界人口激增，原有房屋租賃一空，即歷年久廢無人過問者亦無不賃得善價，其後避地來滬者，日益衆多，供求之勢，更相懸殊，一榻之地，需數十金，壟斷居奇，糾紛日出；蓋利之所在，勢所必至也。</p>
<p>本年春問，建築事業因之大爲活動，大批住屋，分別建造，然其辦法大都將工程所需費用，由承租者一决交付後，可以居住若干年，或將基地房屋一併出售，固可解決一部份問題；然亦倣限於有財力者可以購辦，其無力者依然望梅不能止渴也</p>
<p>現今建築材料因外滙激漲，交通阻塞，又因特殊情形之下，其價蛟前少者增加百分之五上，多者逮一倍以上，建築需費自不得小隨之增高。需耍房屋者旣無力自營，而有力投資者，自亦不得不計算其應得之利息，故目前房金之增高，亦理之固然也。今將普通建築材料戰前戰後之市價，舉例於次，以資比較：</p>
<p>蓋建築需要，旣屬供不應求，地價高漲，亦勢所必至；然而來者仍不絕於途，不以高昂而裏足，誠以上海雖形成孤島，尙能保持表面之安全，故工廠住宅，勃然薈集，據最近統計：</p>
<p>新建廠房的一千餘所店　房的一千餘幢</p>
<p>住屋的三千餘幢　住宅的四百餘宅</p>
<p>現在所造各種房屋，大都已將所用材料，設法减輕，或將材料等級略予改換，以求造價之平衡；然而較之以前，已不能以道里計矣。西區一帶，造有大批木屋，暫濟一時之需；蓋中等以下居民，其力不能担負，不得不趨集於是。於法當然不合，然不得不予以通融而濟其窮也。</p>
<h3 id="c95">近百年來之船運業  潤民 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>近百年來英商怡和洋行及其各創辦人，均能刻苦經營，賴東西洋間貿易上之結合，將東方之古代文明及西方之機械進步冶於一爐，使變方各蒙其利。基於此種商業結合而成之友誼，不特過去已有一世紀以上之歷史，即來日之發揚光大，亦可預下焉。</p>
<p>當一八三四年搿茲拉夫牧師在廣州擔任怡和洋行翻譯時，常乘怡和洋行之船隻，往來海上。搿牧師曾有一函致渣甸博士云：</p>
<p>「閣下對於歐西各國與中國自由貿易之事務，業已克盡協力增進之責；來日在科學與商業方面，定可獲得美滿之結果。」</p>
<p>觀上所言，即知怡和洋行對於政治問題，素不聞問；惟賴營業以增進雙方之文化與道德，蓋此種結果，決非涉及政洽者所能完成。故「以經營商業爲服務目的」一語已成該行之格言。値此非常時期，該行之令譽仍能保持於不墮，推本溯源，亦即在此。</p>
<p>怡和洋行之略史，可作如下之紀述：</p>
<p>一八零二年時渣甸博士方服務於東印度公司，即覺遠東貿易，頗有發展之可能，惟因格於公司定章，雇員不得儘量經營事業，乃辭去東印度公司之職位而買棹去澳。適遇麥克納格，晤談之下，頓成莫逆。時麥氏任麥克納格公司之經理，且已獲得東印度公司所頒發之營業執照矣。</p>
<p>麥西遜當時服務於彼伯父在加爾加答所經營之商店中，因性喜冒險，故於一八一八年時前赴廣州，即加入渣甸與麥克納格共同出資組織麥克納格公司，由渣甸運貨於中國印度之間，麥西遜則常駐印度，所有由渣甸自遠東方面運來之貨物由彼分配，而麥克納格則往來於廣州澳門間，任印度及海峽殖民地進口貨物之代理人。</p>
<p>至一八三二年六月三十日麥克納格公司結束後，即於是年七月一日正式成立今日之怡和洋行（亦稱渣甸洋行）。現任該行之總大班渣甸爵士即當日渣甸博士之曾姪孫。即現任該行之董事，亦大半出自此世家望族。彼等之生長地爲蘇格蘭之頓費　鄉。</p>
<p>一八四二年八月二十九日南京條的簽訂後，翌年十一月十七日，上海被闢爲通商海港。年終前即有外船七艘，駛抵此間，共中噸位之最大者即怡和洋行之「依立薩·斯蒂華脫號」，載重達四百二十三噸。</p>
<p>當時中國尙無海上運輸公司之設立，故如營貿易即須自置船隻，怡和洋行即擁有此種船隻甚多。當時大半著名快船，無不樹有「白水碧海一之旗幟。</p>
<p>中國南北洋之貿易，開始於一八三年，由雙桅帆船一梅洛潑號行駛。及後沿海及揚子江內，亦均有怡和船往來其問。至一八五八年日本開放門，怡和洋行即最先派船行駛。現任常務董事托苪凱捷克之祖父—威廉凱捷克先生，對於日本貿易，允感興趣。彼一生中之大半時間，即盡瘁於增進日本與國外貿易之事業中。</p>
<p>此類事業嗣後合併組織一中印輪船公司，從事於增進印度及遠束間之貿易，目前仍有五大巨輪，輪流行駛於加爾加答及遠束之間。</p>
<p>一八二九年，麥西遜乃介紹蒸汽機至遠東。彼雇有一拖船「福勃斯號」拖引滿載貨物之雙帆船「的美雪娜號」至中國。因自信必有把握，乃與他人作賭謂：如於三個月內不達目的地者，　　以一千金爲壽。不幸天時欠佳，結果較預定時間遲到二日，麥西遜之初衷遂吿失敗。</p>
<p>惟此種實騐不復舉行，蓋發覺廣州一地，無適當煤斤可供蒸汽機之應用，及後福勃斯號即以木村代煤作燃料，滿載貨物，駛歸加爾加答，幷應允貨主如在一個月內到達目的地，則運費减半收取，此行結果，尙稱圓滿。</p>
<p>一八三五年該行擬以第一艘蒸汽輪船運至中國，以俾行駛於廣州澳鬥之間。奈因無此先例，被滿淸皇帝硃筆所批駁。於是船中之引擎雖已裝置就緒，仍不免被迫卸除。該船遂以帆船形式，往來於沿海各埠</p>
<p>是年中印輪船公司之快船「雪爾夫號」以十七日又十七小時之時間，自加爾加答駛至林丁。此决造成之帆船速率紀錄，迄今未被打破。</p>
<p>迨一八四四年，簽訂合同，該行始得於廣州香港間，舉行最初之蒸汽輪客運，船名「考賽阿號」，故言中國海岸行駛汽輪，當以一八四四年爲嚆矢，機械之偉能旣奪天然之風力而去，晴天碧海中，富有詩意之白帆遂不克與汽輪爭勝矣</p>
<p>當時之輪船乃單層甲板，而艙位均圍繞於划水輪之四周者，吾人今日所知之暗輪猶未發明，在洶湧大海之中，日聞划水輪擊水之聲，旅行者之痛苦，吾人當能想像得之。</p>
<p>雖然，速率之增加乃最有功效之舉，故所有缺點，經數度改良即吿完善，該行之輪船隊遂急速擴張，中國日本之主要城市及加爾加答等地，均有怡和輪船之踪跡，最初之輪船載重不過五百噸，及後逐步擴充，時至今日，怡和輪船之規模宏大，已因內河吃水及碼頭容量之限制，而達無以復加之境地矣。</p>
<p>今日怡和洋行（即中印輪船公司）之輪船隊，其設備之完美，足堪與世界任何輪船公司並駕前驅。雖因迫於環境，不能盡量擴充，然事實上已足敷用。該公司最近建造之「德生，永生，泰生」，已將中國沿海之貿易，自天津經各主要口岸而擴展至海防。每小時可行十五海里。此類船隻已超越中國沿海所行其他輸船之速度，即以「泰生」號言，自汕頭至上海，途中航行不過四十二小時耳。</p>
<p>至於中國招商局前向英國定購之四新輪，最近由庚款委員會轉售該行後，亦已重加修理。速度雖不過十二海里，惟自香港經汕頭而至上海之航程，即遇東北季節風，所費亦不過三日又半，此類船隻已易名爲怡生，裕生，和生，民生，各該輪速率之增加，定能獲得貨主，辦貨者及乘客之贊許。對於艙位亦已大加改良，允以後述之四輪爲甚。蓋各等華人艙位之設備，業爲仟何行駛於中國沿海岸之其他輪船所不及。怡和洋行即將此項優良船隻分別航行於沿海一帶。因得貨主乘客之通力合作，使輪船來往均按時刻，而貨主及乘客自身亦受其益。</p>
<p>怡和洋行因欲適應目前之困難環境起見，曾煞費苦心，努力籌維。職是之故，怡和洋行之旗幟，仍能飄揚於中國各地，無論沿海及內江之航述，亦能保持效力，勝仟愉快。蓋今日之情形與開創時期相埒，爲適應公衆需要計，不得不作臨時之籌劃與新路之開闢。即觀今日怡和洋行經理處之遍佈四方，可見已遠超過去之範圍矣。</p>
<p>爲達到上項目的並兼顧尊重條的計，乃另行與中和運輸公司密切聯絡合作，該公司由張瑞芝先生經理。中和運輸公司與該行已有多年之關係，自一九三五年來，更與該公司實行簽發負責聯運提單自各岸逕發交各內地，即遠如陝省之西安府亦能辦理水陸聯運。此種辦法，實施以來，頗收成效，對於貨主，裨益更大。</p>
<p>一九三七年八月，長江交通，發生阻碍。幸賴該公司之忠誠服務乃得將滬漢間數萬噸之貨物，繞道江北，輾轉運輸，實行數月，成效甚著。及至最近，該行又與中和運輸公司合作，移轉目光至海防一綫，而辦理滬滇水陸聯運。</p>
<p>中和運輸公司自一九三八年八月起，於海防，昆明，重慶一帶已分設分公司及代理處，所有貨物亦用水陸聯運制度，暢行各地。此種措施，乃完全依照怡和洋行之營業方針而實行，除商業意義外，不涉其他。最近廣州灣亦已設有分公司及倉庫，大批貨物均經此由汽車路運入內地。</p>
<p>是項設施，困難殊多，惟因當事者振作精神，遂能順利克復。按今之處世與往日不同，惟勇於任事不畏艱難之人，其事業始克成功。怡和洋行之遭遇困難，非自今日始；惟今日之怡和洋行，因有輪給職工之擁護，及中和這輸公司全體同人之通力合作，更能以不屈不撓之精神，戰勝困難。董怡和洋行得有今日之聲譽，亦由此種精神所締造者也。</p>

<h3 id="c96">掃蕩僞鈔 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 巴盾</p>
<p>抗戰近二年，我國金融穩固如初，法幣信用益形卓著·爲了這，敵人不知道絞去多少腦汁，企圖擾亂我金融，幻想破壊我法幣的信用。比如製造僞「聯合準備銀行」發行僞幣，在控制區域內强迫使用，吸收法幣套取外滙和大量製造僞票，使奸徒在市面上混用等都是。但這些都被我政府抵制得當，予敵人的陰謀以重大打擊。正當敵人黔驢技窮而苦悶不堪的時候，以維護法幣信用的平準基金突吿成立。這無異給敵人當頭一棍。所以無怪乎日本軍閥急得走頭無路，策動他們的喉舌說什麽：「吾人可謂英國維持中國法幣，不啻已加入中國之經濟游擊戰」而在吠報復了！</p>
<p>今後我國法幣將更加穩固，當然毫無疑義；但是吾們能以爲日本因此而會放棄這陰謀嗎？絕對不會！非但不會，而且敵人會利用他們的爪牙擴大和加緊這個侵略！最近敵人在華北强制使用僞「聯銀」的僞幣，以及報載財政部近據密報謂日方在大連僞造巨額僞鈔，已有二千二百萬企圖在各淪陷區混用，故特電令各省政府轉飭所屬及商會一體密切防範之電文，都是明證。</p>
<p>關於敵人在華北强制使用「聯銀」僞幣，前（三月二十七日）本報經濟專刊的第一次座談記錄，「華北禁用法幣之今後」一文裏已有詳明透徹的闡述，毋須我再來喋喋。在這裏筆者想說的就是我們怎樣來對付這有組織有計劃在市面上大規模混用的仿冒法幣的僞鈔問題。</p>
<p>僞紗在市面上魚目混珠，本不自現在始。在戰前早有流行，而成爲金融界的心腹之息。不過，那時候，一者有法律可以制裁，軍警當局的嚴密取締，使一般不肖之徒有所顧忌；二者因製造僞鈔的機關規模較小，印刷的技術也很惡劣，即使是沒有多大經騐的也能鑑別，故其威脅還不致於甚大。然而，現在情勢大不同了，擾亂者已不是脊小而是蓄意不削弱吾法幣決不肯罷休的敵人了。他們製造機關的規模既大，印刷技巧叉精明，而又是作大量生產。所以爲害之大，已遠非昔比。如果再不奮起掃蕩，其影響於法幣信用以及人民生活者將不堪設想。故無論爲鞏固金融以保障最後勝利計，或爲免遭自身的損失計，撲滅偽鈔已是急不容緩的事了。</p>
<p>日前筆者遇到服務於金融界的友人某君，談起這件事，他也頗具同感。經過一番熱烈的討論，吾們得到了四個結論。這四個結論雖然不能把僞幣全部撲滅，但至少可以使侵略者感到棘手，而終於迫使他們不得不放棄這個毒計。結論如下：</p>
<p>（一）督促租界軍警當局嚴密取締。</p>
<p>（二）銀錢業公會以及各同業公會應規定一種「統一」的戲記，通知各會員，如遇到僞鈔時立即加蓋上去；並以這規定的戮肥公諸社會。</p>
<p>（三）收集各種僞票，公開展覽，俾使一般民衆有所防範</p>
<p>（四）對鑑別僞票有特殊經騐者，應以僞鈔的弱點公吿社會（關於這一點，筆者以爲接觸鈔票最多的金融機關的收支人員應負起這個責任來。）</p>
<h3 id="c97">談「不吃魚翅」 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 雁</p>
<p>魚翅是菜餚中的一種高貴食物，是山錯海味中的珍品，但也是無上的奢侈品。牠的產地，除呂宋與婆羅洲外，便是日本；中國的海岸錢雖長，而且是產巨鯊的名地，但因捕魚方法，尙未臻上科學的設備，所以僅賴土法的捕捉，魚翅是絕不易生產的。上海方面的魚翅來源，以從日本進口的爲最多，從南洋方面輸入的，僅係最少數；因此，就目前抗戰時期的立塲，肯定地說魚翅全是「劣貨」，藉以使國人根絕不喫，實在沒有過甚其詞的地方。</p>
<p>最近市商會勸吿各商店及住戶，凡喜慶婚喪宴會必需之酒筵，應廢除採用魚翅，以節省糜費，盡良心上的職責，濟助難胞；這不論從「節的濟難」，及「國民精神總動員」的原則上說，都是刻不容緩，應當由每一個孤島上的有錢的中國人來切實踐行的事。同時，爲了保住抗戰的國力，不作無謂消耗——特別是這消耗含有「資敵」的成份，則更應該澈底廢食的！</p>
<p>但，如果不喫魚翅以後，依然採用其他名貴之菜，如以燕菜，銀耳，熊掌，鹿筋等菜餚代替之，則雖再無「資敵」之咎，然於「節約」與「精神動員」的原則上，仍大相抵觸，仍有「換湯不換藥」之嫌！</p>
<p>我們的目標：要把這從每席酒筳上「不喫魚翅」所節省下來的金錢，全數移作濟難和獻金。</p>
<p>全上海的同胞們！我們勿再連這一些良心上的覺悟，永遠沒有了喲？</p>
<p>生活報吿</p>
<h3 id="c98">三年以後　練習生的苦悶 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— （無光）</p>
<p>我們公司裏的規定：練習生的練習期限爲三年。進來的第一年每月月規爲二元，以後逐年加一二元不等，三年滿了後則每個月可領薪十元。</p>
<p>三年似乎是一個漫長的時間吧，而希望却就是這區區的十元。但在這個「吃飯難」的年頭，「粥少僧多」，也就伏伏貼貼地進來了。</p>
<p>好容易，漫長的時間在灰色的氛圍下溜了過去，然而希望却變成了一個破碎的幻夢。爲什麼呢？……</p>
<p>我們每個月從會計科長那只肥大的手裏領到的却還是二張破舊的鈔票。我們能埋怨自己的命運嗎？于是，我們開始反抗了：</p>
<p>「×先生，我們已三年了呀！」</p>
<p>「不錯。但是「八一三」後，廠裏始終停頓着，公司已沒有了收入，你們總也該知道的。」</p>
<p>我們沒有話說，接過了那二張破舊的鈔票，默默地離開了會計室。</p>
<p>但前幾年公司裏營業的興盛，我們也是知道的：廠裏開了夜工，貨品不斷的漲價，公積金就積起了一百多萬。</p>
<p>那麽，這一百多萬錢在「八一三」後是吾也受到損耗了呢？沒有！一些都沒有。而公司却借了「八一三」的名義，連我們三年以後所應得的每個月僅有的十元錢也不肯照付了。</p>
<p>偌大的一個公司難道必須斤乎較量這數元錢嗎？况且，員也裁過了，薪也扣過了。</p>
<p>無疑的，這是一種無理的壓力！我們是受騙了，三年以前是二元，三年以後還是二元。那麽四年以後，五年以後呢？中國的抗戰是長時期的，我們每個月領二元錢的月規也該是長時期的了吧</p>
<p>而年齡是一年年的在增加着。誰剝奪了我們的寳貴的歲月？誰侵蝕了我們的靑春的生命？連一個渺少得可憐的希望也破碎了。——呵—我們是受騙了。</p>
<p>反抗嗎？根本沒有這一回事。反正在這個年頭有的是人，你不願意在這裏，滾好了！</p>
<p>卽使進一步說：聯合同一的階層，用集體的力量來作鬥爭。但我們已認淸了這個時代，在抗戰期間，不願掀起鬥爭的浪潮。</p>
<p>于是，我們苦悶着。</p>
<p>我們沒有什麽奢望，願公司當局能瞭解我們這個小小的苦悶，實踐從前的諾言：然後讓大家合作起來，渡過這個艱苦的偉大的時代。</p>
<h3 id="c99">河上戀歌 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>“St.Louis　Biues”</p>
<p>派拉蒙公司出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>桃樂姗拉摩　勞合瑙倫合演</p>
<p>自從「獸國情侶」，「獸國女皇」以後，桃樂姗拉摩道名字已深深地烙印在觀衆的腦膜上。道果然是拉摩的歌聲的誘惑性和挑撥性爲一般靑年觀衆所眷愛，但她的豐腴的體格，嫵媚的眼風，修長的秀髮，以及富於南國情調的作風，都是爲愛好好萊塢作品的觀衆所癖愛的。所以像「靑年戀愛營」那樣僅僅由拉摩客串唱一支歌，也以桃樂姗拉摩主演的宇樣來號召觀衆了。</p>
<p>「河上戀歌」呢，它確有一個拉摩型的故事的，而且是抄襲了「畫舫緣」的形式，羅曼斯的發生就在密西西貝河上的「聖路易士藍」畫舫中。故事是簡單得不能冉簡單，拉摩因爲不願冉演穿錦秀圍裙的南海土女角色，不顧經理人的合同，逃上「聖路易士藍」畫舫。於是，和船主代夫墮入情網，終成眷屬。</p>
<p>在我們的肥憶上，如這樣同型的故事是要多要少舉例出來的，拋開意義不談，但也有好多由於編製和導演的優越，可以給我們技術上的學習的，而「河上戀歌」這二點都是失敗的。</p>
<p>第一：這故事發生在畫舫上，由於分幕的不週密，顯得非常瑣碎，混亂。而桃樂姗拉摩除了歌唱之外，不能給她更多演戲的機會，也是可惜的。</p>
<p>第二：導演者果然以喜劇底手腕，運用小噱頭來博取觀衆的笑聲，但同樣不能集中在主綫上，渲染，强調，使它深刻動人。至於利用音樂，及河上的反光來陪襯畫舫的情調，在個別的畫面上果然有使人悠然神往的境地，但它不能使人有溶化地感覺。最大的缺點是拉摩和勞合瑙倫的戀愛過程，寫得非常糢糊，如勞合瑙倫特地撰擇了一支歌曲，請拉摩歌唱的時候，拉摩因經理人登報警吿的關係，悲泣不能成歌那塲戲，導演者也淡淡的放了過去。同株拉摩歸來的那塲戲也是不够突出的。其他織接的不够明快，也是大缺點。</p>
<p>即如最後那塲戲，應該是本片的高潮，導演者雖然四面八方都顧到了，熱鬧或許楚熱鬧了，但從黑女歌唱起一直到拉摩歌畢，這熱鬧祇是浮面的。</p>
<p>而拉摩最後畢竟穿了土女的圍裙出現了，這或許是表示她對勞合瑙倫熱愛之忱，也可以說是她對經理人的示戚，然和開塲她拒絕演飾土女的話剛相反，這與其說是劇作者的矛盾，不如說好萊塢電影公司的矛盾，宋雅海妮是以溜冰成名的，他們以後肯放棄溜冰片嗎，即使叫部電影以來，使觀衆看厭了，但誰敢吾定宋雅海妮的下一部作品不是溜冰片呢。拉摩的圍裙也是同樣，不能例外的。</p>
<p>勞合瑙倫從前是專演偵探片的，這里的代夫不見出色。</p>
<p>這里的幾支歌，將如Moonlight　at　Shadow　一樣，會流行在舞塲里的，因爲它都是充滿着藍色的情調。</p>

<p>第七回　乳燕新鶯影聯雙璧　越羅吳錦機織七襄</p>
<p>這時由童海嬰給何家兩姊妹，三位小弟弟合攝一影，又由何儷玉給三個小孩子攝了一影，再把他們的保姆康寗女士，也攝了進去。再到各處去巡游一回，然後回去。何家兩位小姐，一連在這裏住了幾天，便和這裏的幾位姊妹很熟了。不過她們是都有職務的，不能時常陪着她們去游玩，而她們也能自己到各處游散，並不擾亂她們的職務。此外她們兩姊妹，都是工業家，都是紡織工業的專門家，她們雖在那個小市鎭上，也藉以攷察一切。她們父親臨行的時候，的定隨時通電通信。父親在北平所住的地方，她們是知道的，因此到了安樂鎭的明天，便打了個電報去。報吿她們現在已到了朱愛人那裏了，望父親不必掛念。安樂鎭雖然是一個市鎭，也有電報局和郵政局，交通非常便利。而且近年以來，中國國內的電報費，降至十分低廉。因爲電信旣已發達，收入增多，况且電報爲國家所辦，爲了利便國民，當然更加便利。有許多小城市，小村鎭，電報局都和郵政局在一起的。就像安樂鎭，電報局也就在郵政局裹，佔了一角地方。爲的郵政局是很熱鬧，電報局是較淸閑。何家兩位小姐，預備在安樂鎭至少要住兩星期，就是這兩星期之內，要到自由村的話，父親若有回電和回信來，只消轉一轉到自由村就得了。因爲從安樂鎭到自由村，沒有多路，汽車汽船，一天到晚往來着，經過的人就不知多少。兩位小姐旣打了電報給父親，詳細的情形，又寫了快信去。在戰前的郵政局，因爲中國有許多地方，交通阻塞，一封信常常耽擱了好幾天。像中國內地，舟車不通，山川隔閡的地方，竟有耽擱到十幾天，幾十天的。至於邊遠地方，幾個月通一封信，也是有的。現在却大不相同了，要知道我們中國的戰後恢復力極大，第一就在於交通便利。不僅是恢復了戰前的交通，而目開闢了許多戰後的交通。因此政府當局，努力進行。因爲中國的土地如許之廣，人民如此其多，交通愈發達，實業愈進展，國家社會的進步，眞好比大雨下降，沛然莫之能禦了。（七七）</p>

<h3 id="e1">New Deployments of Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangxi Completed, Japanese Invaders in Trouble; Japanese Troops Peep at Gao'an Along Nanwan Highway, Meeting Strong Resistance; Chinese Increase Fortifications and Implement Guerrilla Warfare; Shaping Recovered, Chinese Troops in Jiangmen Shift to Favorable Terrain; Chinese Troops and Local Militias in Xinhui Jointly Encircle Japanese Troops <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) New deployments and military preparations by the Chinese forces in northern Jiangxi are complete. They continue to attack the Japanese troops. Chinese troops north of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway have largely taken control of everything. The Japanese troops invading Nanchang are already in trouble. The Japanese troops that invaded Jing'an and Wuning are engaged in battles with the Chinese troops nearby. (Morning dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Xiushui: On the morning of the 2nd, approximately two regiments of Japanese troops, along with an artillery battalion, advanced on Gao'an along the Nanwan Highway. The Chinese troops bravely resisted northeast of Gao'an, about ten *li* away, and the battle was extremely fierce. Many Japanese armored vehicles were seen in the western hills of Wanshou Palace. Japanese troops north of Xiangtang are reportedly building fortifications. The Japanese troops occupying Wuning have made no progress. Overall, the current deployment of the Japanese troops suggests that their main focus is on the Nanwan Highway. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Xiushui: Japanese troops from Xiangfuguan, northeast of Gao'an, about ten *li* away, briefly invaded the area and engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese troops. At dawn on the 2nd, the Chinese troops launched a fierce counterattack, engaging in close combat with the Japanese troops throughout the day, killing three to four hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing many ponchos and gas masks. Fierce fighting continued in the area into the evening. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: After Xiangfuguan fell into Japanese hands on the 1st, Chinese troops launched a major counterattack at dawn on the 2nd, one route heading towards Shiling, northwest of Xiangfuguan, and the other towards Sigongshan, east of Xiangfuguan, launching fierce attacks. Heavy fighting ensued, resulting in the death and injury of three to four hundred Japanese soldiers and the capture of many spoils of war. By around 9 a.m., the fighting had subsided. In the afternoon, Chinese and Japanese troops made contact again, and the stalemate continues to this day. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: The Japanese troops that invaded Huangxishi, north of Hualiangjiadu along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Highway, have been completely repelled by the Chinese troops after fierce resistance. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Newspapers here are discussing the future goals of the Japanese troops. Many believe that after capturing Nanchang, the Japanese troops will continue to advance towards Changsha, then turn south to coordinate with the Japanese troops advancing from northern Guangdong. Chinese military reports confirm a large westward advance, seemingly aimed at Gao'an, but the ultimate goal appears to be Changsha, as the Japanese troops are increasingly active in northern Hunan. The Chinese strategy to cope with this involves strengthening fortifications in key cities and towns, and implementing guerrilla warfare near Nanchang to prevent the Japanese troops from advancing rapidly. The *Dagongbao* newspaper emphasized in a commentary that the future strategy of the Chinese troops should focus on preventing the Japanese troops from advancing. (Dispatch from Huitong News Agency on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to dispatches from the Chinese front lines, fighting continues in the vicinity of Gao'an, southwest of Nanchang. However, the Japanese advance has been halted two miles south of Wuning. Fighting is reportedly taking place between Jiangmen and Xinhui in southern China. After reinforcements arrived, the Chinese troops are now defending Chen Village, east of Xinhui. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Xiushui: The city walls of Wuning are surrounded by mountains, forming a basin, and the Xiushui River winds around its southwest, further hindering any westward invasion. On the 31st, the 1st, and the 2nd, small groups of Japanese soldiers crossed the river to probe three kilometers southwest. The Chinese troops bravely counterattacked, and the Japanese soldiers, fearing annihilation due to their position with their backs to the river, fled back to the city walls. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops advancing along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Nanchang are still engaged with the Chinese troops near Liangjiadu. The section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway west of Yingtan, up to Jinxian, has been destroyed by the Chinese troops. Fighting remains intense near Gao'an, southwest of Nanchang. The Japanese troops advancing from Wuning towards Xiushui are being held back by the Chinese troops northwest of Wuning, at Qiantian Bridge and Yangang. (Dispatch from Kuai Xun News Agency on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi are currently advancing westward in two routes: one from Wuning towards Xiushui, and the other along the Hunan-Hubei Highway, attempting to converge on Changsha. It is reported that the first route of Japanese troops is being intercepted by Chinese troops at Fenkou Town, twenty-five kilometers northeast of Xiushui. The second route of Japanese troops is still engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops in the Shanghuxu and Huipu areas near Gao'an. The main force of the Chinese troops that withdrew from the Nanchang area has now reached a new position forty-five miles southwest of Nanchang. This new position was constructed after the loss of De'an last year. The trenches and fortifications are built in the mountains, stretching for dozens of kilometers, forming the only route for the Japanese troops to attack Changsha from Jiangxi Province. It is widely believed that if the Japanese troops continue to advance southwest, they will suffer extremely heavy losses in that area. (Dispatch from Kuai Xun News Agency on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Chinese counterattack on Jiangmen continued into the morning of the 2nd, with fighting still ongoing. The entire North Street area has fallen into Japanese hands. Chinese troops and militias from Xinhui, Kai, and Taishan counties are encircling the Japanese troops in the Xinhui city area. Fierce fighting raged throughout the night of the 1st. More than twenty Japanese aircraft bombed Xinhui city and Shankoushui in Kaiping in the afternoon of the 1st, dropping over a hundred bombs, causing severe damage. Shaping has been recovered by the Chinese troops. Militia units from Heshan have successively arrived in Xinhui as reinforcements. The situation in Zhongshan is extremely tense. The county government reports that the Qiguan Highway is ready to be destroyed if necessary. (Special dispatch at 9 p.m. on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The Japanese troops invading Jiangmen continue to advance westward along the Ningyang Railway, attempting to attack Xinhui County. Another force is coordinating with the Japanese troops along the highway and railway from North Street. Chinese militia units are currently holding Lile Village, southeast of the railway. The village is heavily populated with thousands of able-bodied men, who have risen up to assist in the defense. The Chinese militia units are deployed to block the Japanese troops invading from North Street. The village is fifteen *li* away from Xinhui County, and its strategic location suggests that fierce fighting is expected. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Sihui: The Japanese troops invading North Street in Jiangmen continued to receive reinforcements yesterday, dividing into two forces to probe along the railway and highway. They were intercepted by local civilian defense groups along the way. The Chinese militia units lured the Japanese troops to Lile Village, about ten *li* southwest of Jiangmen, and launched a fierce joint attack with thousands of able-bodied men from the village. The Japanese troops were repulsed and dared not advance further. As of the evening of the 1st, the Chinese militia units were still holding the watchtowers in the village, launching attacks from high ground, inflicting heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese troops are still in a stalemate with the Chinese militia units outside the village. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Sihui: The Japanese troops invading Jiangmen were met with a head-on attack by Chinese militia units on the night of the 29th, suffering heavy casualties. They attacked again on the afternoon of the 31st. When the Japanese troops approached the outskirts of the city, the Chinese troops suddenly launched an ambush, resulting in fierce fighting for three hours, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops, unable to withstand the attack, retreated in disarray. They then reinforced with over three hundred more men, launching a fierce attack on Beijiebu, about six *li* south of Jiangmen. Shallow-water warships also opened fire in support. The Chinese troops, facing attacks from both the north and south, withdrew from Jiangmen on the night of the 31st and shifted to defend advantageous positions in the west of the city, continuing the resistance. The stalemate continued until midnight. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: Xinhui County Magistrate Li Wuzi, under orders, led the city militia to defend the city. Women and children in the city纷纷 evacuated along the Ningyang Railway and by waterways. Many able-bodied men remained in the city, preparing to assist the militia and defend the city to the death. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Sihui: The Chinese team counterattacking Shaping, after a day and night of brave fighting, completely recovered Shaping on the 30th. The remaining Japanese troops abandoned dozens of bodies and retreated towards Gulao. (Dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, Jiangmen was recaptured by the Japanese yesterday. The fighting is gradually expanding towards the southwest. Several Japanese aircraft again bombed the Shiqi area yesterday. Chinese refugees have been fleeing to Macau since yesterday morning. (Dispatch from Kuai Xun News Agency on the 2nd)</p>

<p>Yang: The Chinese troops' counterattack on Xinyang has resulted in victories on all fronts. The Japanese headquarters outside Xinyang City was breached by Chinese troops the day before yesterday. The Japanese troops responded in a panic, and over fifty officers and soldiers were killed by the Chinese. The Japanese ammunition depot at the Xinyang train station was set on fire by Chinese troops the night before last, and it was completely destroyed. A certain Chinese division commander, with a spirit of certain death, led his troops to scale the North Gate yesterday, destroying two Japanese cannons and killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, the Japanese troops reinforced with over a thousand men, and the Chinese troops withdrew to a certain section and continued fighting the Japanese.

<h3 id="e8">Wang Jingwei Advocates Peace Again <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Three or five days ago, a dispatch from Hong Kong reported that Jingwei had written an article advocating peace again. The dispatch was brief, making it unclear what he meant. When advancing, he becomes ecstatic, unaware of political affairs and lacking a sense of the bigger picture. When retreating, he complains and resorts to writing, oblivious to logic. Chinese scholars have always been like this, with these kinds of faces and habits. Is Jingwei not one of them? Recently, I happened to see a translation of his article. Its shallowness and immaturity are truly lamentable. When he betrayed the country and fled, making lofty pronouncements, some lamented that he had cut himself off from the people and his future. In reality, he is not without talent, but his past experiences have prevented him from seeking further progress, causing him to remain in a stage of immaturity and superficiality. It is unfortunate that he is stuck in the past, not that he has no future. The article is not worth addressing or refuting, but given the fallacies it contains, and the need to clarify the distinctions between peace and war, a journalist cannot remain silent. Let me explain them separately:</p>
<p>First, the end of a war must involve negotiations for peace. This is the simplest of principles. Therefore, in the midst of war, one should not fear that peace will never come, and indeed, the more one fights, the closer one gets to the day of peace. The issue is how to seize the best opportunity for peace negotiations. If the conditions are not met, there should be no negotiations. If the timing is not right, there should be no negotiations. Otherwise, regardless of the theory or the pretext, the objective result will be surrender. In early December of the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic, 1937], a little over a hundred days after the August 13th Incident, German Ambassador to China Oskar Trautmann conveyed to the Chinese authorities the Japanese side's conditions for ending the war. The conditions were not made public, but it is said that their content was milder than the statement made by Konoe [Fumimaro] on December 22nd of the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, 1938]. Konoe's statement included demands for inland residency and the stationing of troops, and it touched on the structure of the Chinese central government. It was as if he was a victorious power using peace as a smokescreen for the destruction of China. It is said that the German ambassador's message was not like this. Therefore, although outsiders cannot know how the Chinese authorities responded to the German ambassador, we cannot hastily believe what the traitor has reported. Given that the conditions varied at different times, we cannot say that the response to the German ambassador should have been the same as the response to Konoe's statement. Moreover, in the first three or four months of the war of resistance, the Chinese side was ill-equipped and faced a powerful enemy. Neither the front lines nor the rear were stable. After more than a year, by the end of last year, although the battle lines had shifted, the military had a stronger grasp on ultimate victory than in the initial stages. Conversely, the signs of defeat and weakness on the Japanese side were becoming increasingly apparent. Therefore, the timing at the end of last year cannot be said to be the same as the timing at the end of the previous year.</p>
<p>Second, war and peace are major national affairs, not child's play, and should not be undertaken lightly. Therefore, in the face of a crisis, when war is imminent, when it is possible to fight or concede, those in charge of national planning should gather ideas and consider things thoroughly. As for the citizens, whether in or out of government, they should all rack their brains and contribute to the nation. Thus, a decision is made to fight or not to fight. Once the war has broken out, the entire country must be of one mind and heart, facing the great calamity together. There is a nation, and there is no individual selfishness. There is national policy, and there is no preconceived notion. Everything puts the military first. Regardless of the citizens, they should automatically contribute their lives and assets to the nation, and their words and actions should conform to national policy. As for the nation, it has the full authority to control the lives, assets, words, and actions of its citizens. For any matter, thing, or object that hinders the war effort, there must be severe sanctions. The government has the power to execute, and the people have the inherent duty to protect the nation and its policies at all times and in all places. Now, clearly disregarding what is right and engaging in speech and actions that violate national policy, and then blaming others for "scolding and slandering," is tantamount to fundamentally denying the existence of the national organization and the arguments and values that underpin it.</p>
<p>Third, the so-called "if China and Japan fight, both will be hurt; if they make peace, both will prosper" is an empty philosophical cliché, and it is extremely immature and superficial to take it as the sole argument for advocating peace. In so-called fighting, one must first ask what they are fighting for. In so-called peace, one must first ask how peace can be achieved. China does not want war but has no choice but to resist because it is a matter of life and death. If it does not resist, it will die or perish, which is more than just being hurt. In other words, the war was initiated by the Japanese. They have not only failed to withdraw their troops and cease hostilities but have also continued to invade. I ask, does China have any other option besides resistance? In this situation where resistance is unavoidable, to oppose resistance and advocate peace is to ask, what else is there besides submission and surrender? One must know that this decision to wage war, not only was the war initiated by Japan, but also the key to whether the war continues or ends, up to this point, lies with Japan. Only if China resists until Japan changes its plans, withdraws its troops, and ceases hostilities will China have no need to continue its resistance. Or, if resistance continues until Japan's strength is depleted and it can no longer invade and has no choice but to withdraw its troops, China will then have room to discuss peace. The war will end in peace, but that is not what is being discussed in China today. As for the so-called hundred-year plan for East Asia, hundred-year stability, and coexistence and co-prosperity between China and Japan, the Japanese have said it often and for a long time, but the content of their stability and prosperity is the conquest of China, and the way they are implementing it is also the conquest of China. How can China abandon its only path to survival through resistance and respond to it?</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japanese Plan to Permanently Station Heavy Troops in China; Establish Factories Locally to Manufacture Munitions; Plunder Raw Materials and Squeeze the Lifeblood of the People <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources here, the Japanese military, in order to permanently station heavy troops in China and at the same time eliminate the need to transport munitions and supplies, plans to establish munitions industries and various other military supply factories in the areas where troops are stationed in China. At a recent session of the Japanese Diet, someone asked Army Minister Itagaki [Seishiro] about the troop stationing plan in China. Itagaki replied, "For the sake of sound national defense, the best approach is to develop important industries on the mainland that can produce munitions. In this way, our heavy troops can be stationed on the mainland for a long time to prevent any unforeseen changes." One of the Diet members then asked, "If our country were to obtain raw materials from Manchuria and China based on the economic grouping of the "Japan-Manchukuo-China" triangle, and then transport them back to Japan for processing and manufacturing, wouldn't that be more beneficial?" Army Minister Itagaki replied, "In my opinion, our entire plan should be based on the policy of local self-sufficiency." Furthermore, in the budget subcommittee of the Lower House, a Diet member inquired about the military's purchase of raw materials in China, revealing the following facts: (1) The Japanese military will purchase various local products in the occupied areas and will attempt to squeeze out third-country buyers. (2) The main products purchased by the Japanese are cotton, ramie, wool, and animal hides. (3) The military plans to allocate 60 million yen to purchase these products this summer. (4) The prices of the various raw materials purchased by the Japanese military in the occupied areas are entirely determined by the Japanese side, but in order to promote the recovery of local vitality, they do not plan to excessively suppress prices. (5) Various products that the Japanese military does not need in China will be transported back to Japan by transport ships to be manufactured into commodities for export.

<p>(Dalian) There is an extreme shortage of leather in Japan, so snake skin and toad skin must also be collected for national use. The Japanese authorities are asking the public to donate snakes and toads in exchange for compensation. Even the people within Manchuria must participate in this campaign. The Japanese have recently discovered that sharkskin is an excellent substitute for cowhide. Former Foreign Minister Ugaki has been wearing shoes made of sharkskin for the past few months.

<p>Japanese Warlords Openly Interfere in Politics; Draft Reform Plans and Force Hiranuma to Implement Them</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese army leaders are now planning political actions so that the Hiranuma cabinet can adopt clear steps to implement certain domestic reform plans that the military deems necessary, such as the creation of an independent Ministry of Commerce, the fundamental reorganization of the Cabinet Planning Board, and the study of munitions and military supply prices. People in the army are even planning to form an investigation committee to investigate rear-area activities and advocate that the army should assume responsibility for various issues related to Japan's domestic situation and seek to resolve them. According to the opinion of army leaders, the army committee should investigate the following matters: (1) Whether there are shortcomings in the administration of providing for the families of soldiers at the front. (2) The reemployment and livelihood of disabled soldiers. (3) Whether there have been delays in the consolation money received by the families of soldiers injured in the war in China. (4) The convenience and conditions of army hospitals. The *Jiji Shimpo* newspaper stated that since the establishment of the Konoe cabinet, the army has not been very involved in civil affairs, but now the trend is changing, and it is exerting its efforts that were previously suppressed in order to realize the events it expects from the government. This move will have a real impact on the future position of the Hiranuma cabinet. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 2nd)</p>

<p>Xingji: Japanese troops in Shanxi have repeatedly been attacked by Chinese troops and cannot bear the hardship. They have adopted a strategy of offense as defense, conducting guerrilla warfare everywhere.

East of Tongpu, after Chinese troops recaptured Fushan and Anze, most of the Japanese troops were transferred to the railway line. Except for a portion of Chinese troops now approaching Koucheng and holding out against the Japanese troops, other areas east of the railway are also trending toward quiet. The current battle situation seems to have shifted to southern Shanxi again. Japanese troops have been reinforcing southward from the Linfen Houma area for several days. Thousands of Japanese troops are concentrated in Zhangdian Town south of Xiaxian, conducting guerrilla warfare toward the Xianghe coast. Therefore, the situation in the Pinglu Maojin area is relatively tense. Chinese troops are dividing their forces to block them. This decision by the Japanese troops to turn to southern Shanxi is also a strategy of offense as defense. (2nd day telegram)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The China-Soviet air route "Lanzhou" aircraft, which previously flew to Hami for a test flight, has now flown back to Chongqing. According to the aircraft's Chinese engineer, Lin Qingtai (transliteration), to a Reuters reporter today, the overall weather conditions were very good. The high mountains that must be passed are Qipan Mountain between Xi'an and Lanzhou, Wuxiaoling between Lanzhou and Liangzhou (transliteration), and Daxueshan between Liangzhou and Suzhou. Because each mountain is more than 1,200 feet high, the aircraft had to fly at an altitude of more than 13,000 feet. The Soviet section of the air route between Almaty and Hami has not yet started flying due to snow accumulation at the Urumqi airport. However, it is reported that Soviet Ambassador to China Orelski, who took a car from Chongqing on March 26 to return to Moscow, has already taken the full route through Urumqi.

Since the Japanese occupied the customs, the Chinese government has established a stronger transportation tax system to compensate for the losses. To date, the government has issued 160,000,000 yuan in domestic debt since the start of the war. (2nd day Associated Press)</p>

(2) If England does not have this desire, then this premise fails. (3) Germany does not want to attack other countries but only wants to develop its economic interests. (4) Germany will continue its armament when pressed by other countries. Hitler's speech was not surprising. Although he satirized England, he did not scold it. (2nd day Reuters)</p>
<p>Starting with Old Accounts from Before the War</p>
<p>William Haigang: Hitler delivered a long-awaited speech yesterday before 100,000 listeners. Hitler first described the unfair treatment Germany had suffered in the past. In 1919, the countries that were enemies of Germany seized its territory and exploited its rights. Germany, in a state of being attacked on all sides, could not but take action. However, the 1939 National Socialist Party Congress can be called the Peace Congress (listeners cheered). Germany's aspiration is to make peace its goal. Hitler also said that when William Haigang was first opened as a port and gradually prospered, Germany competed with other countries using peaceful methods, but other countries responded with suspicion, eventually leading to war, which is truly regrettable. At that time, England adopted a policy of encircling Germany. England had stated that after defeating Germany, all countries could benefit. At that time, Germany unfortunately adopted a policy of watching from the sidelines, not engaging in self-defense, eventually leading to the outbreak of war. Everything was unfavorable, which is truly regrettable. However, everyone knows that Germany fought bravely, regardless of personal safety. Unfortunately, it was defeated, not due to the fault of war. Hunger ravaged its physical strength, and the enemy's cunning propaganda further blinded its vision. When Wilson's Fourteen Points were announced, Germany's leaders thought peace could be expected and waited. Hitler, speaking to this point, listed several examples to prove that the outcome of the facts was completely opposite to Wilson's stated intentions, saying that Germany mistakenly believed Wilson's words and rested, never expecting that other countries would repeatedly bully and oppress Germany with plagiarism, even depriving it of its right to survival. At that time, Germany compromised on everything, accommodating itself, and the result was this. I was shocked and determined to save the country, to eliminate domestic enemies, unite the strength of the whole country, and destroy the evil forces of Versailles. As a step-by-step plan, when other countries' politicians advertised maintaining world justice, our reply was—the so-called justice of 1919 is not true justice but the arbitrary tyranny of a few countries. The German nation stands between heaven and earth and should make protecting its fundamental interests its duty and not live to protect the so-called justice of England or the justice of France. This meaning is very clear and needs no further explanation.</p>
<p>New Germany Is No Longer What It Used to Be</p>
<p>Hitler then spoke in a heroic manner, saying that now Germany is united and strong, no need to cater to the wishes of other countries' politicians, no need to worry about the joy and anger of other countries. Thus, he made a brief description of Germany's progress since 1933, and then quoted a proverb to boast, "God helps those who help themselves." We have worked diligently, constantly striving to improve ourselves. In a few years, Germany has indeed emerged from the valley and reached the realm of light. If English politicians now believe that Germany should resolve all issues with other countries through negotiations, then why did the countries not implement this proposal 15 years ago and make fair solutions? Germany also deeply hoped to achieve good results through the Geneva organization. What is regrettable is that it failed to achieve its wish. Since then, Germany has actively promoted domestic and foreign affairs, working hard to build the country. Who knew that the world would regard the national revival of Germany and Italy as a crime? Only countries that do not occupy vast territories can be said to be good deeds?</p>
<p>Mocking England's Lack of Virtue Is Thorough</p>
<p>In reality, what virtues has England had in the past three hundred years? Now it uses virtue as a sermon, which is strange. Even judging from England's actions in the past twenty years, it clearly shows that it does not understand the true meaning of virtue. This can be seen from England's treatment of Germany after the war. I really do not know if there is such a thing as virtue in the world. Ever since I took office, I had proposed to resolve important issues through negotiations, but all were rejected. If England requires discussion of Germany's internal affairs, then I will also make the same request. I believe its response will be "Palestine has nothing to do with you." So the interests that are vital to Germany are also unrelated to England. The principle is the same. The German people cannot abandon the vital interests in this survival competition. Countries ignored justice when Germany was weak, changing the map of Europe. Now the situation has changed, and Germany will not tolerate it. Germany has no hatred for the Czech people. This is something English politicians cannot understand. In fact, St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague was not built by the English or French but by Germans.</p>
<p>Annexing Czechoslovakia Is a Strategic Need</p>
<p>From this perspective, Czech territory has been within our sphere of interest for the past thousand years. Germany's move is also to prevent future crises. Therefore, it can no longer be tolerated. Regarding this point, I can use the words of the former French Air Force Minister as proof, because he said that Czechoslovakia is a base for attacking Germany. This is a major issue that concerns our interests. Looking around the situation, there is no possibility of a peaceful resolution. I had no choice but to annex it based on common geography and history. The Czech people will then enjoy freedoms they have never had before. Germany is now doing its utmost to turn the tools of war against Germany into the foundation of Germany's security. Therefore, I will name this year's National Socialist Party Congress the "National Socialist Party Peace Congress," because Germany really has no intention of attacking other countries.</p>
<p>Developing the Economy Is the Only Desire</p>
<p>Germany's only desire now is to expand its foreign economic relations. Germany's production and consumption are also part of the European economic system. Germany should conduct trade with all countries with an honorable attitude and on the premise of peace. The encirclement policy is intolerable.</p>
<p>Involving the Anglo-German Naval Agreement</p>
<p>As for the naval agreement established between Germany and England, it is also one of Germany's efforts for peace. If England continues this aspiration, then the naval agreement should continue to be effective. But if other countries continue to expand their armaments, Germany is also unwilling to fall behind in order to protect the security of the country. If a certain country wants to measure Germany's military strength, the German people will not hesitate to deal with it. Germany's allies will also express their sympathy for this.</p>
<p>The German-Italian Axis Has Not Weakened</p>
<p>Foreign newspapers often claim that the relationship between the German-Italian axis countries has weakened and even discuss breaking up. This is one of the acts of political sabotage, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. On the contrary, the relationship between the axis countries is more solid than the agreements between any other countries. If the Soviet Union and England are willing to cooperate without making the international situation more tense, then I am also willing to congratulate them. In any case, the ideological link between Germany and Italy is more natural and harmonious than the combination and integration of British capitalism and democracy with Stalin's Bolshevik thought. The discerning person can draw his own conclusions.</p>
<p>Celebrating the Victory of the Spanish National Army</p>
<p>Hitler continued, "In recent days, we have experienced a great victory. A country has been liberated from the ravages of Bolshevism and has gained freedom. We should gladly congratulate Spain on its victory. German youth helped friendly countries obtain national self-determination, while others once supplied the Red Army with arms and now want to trade with the National Army for profit. How can the scale of people's minds be compared?"</p>
<p>Not Sparing Sacrifices to Defend Territory</p>
<p>In short, we have been internally united, and economic life is thriving. No less than millions of Germans have returned to German soil. We are willing to give Central Europe peace and should contribute to defending it. Before the European war, no less than two million Germans sacrificed themselves for the country. Now that Greater Germany has been completed, the sacrifices of the martyrs laid its foundation, and we can achieve its cause. In the future, we should not spare any sacrifices to maintain it, so that the martyrs' benevolence will not be in vain. This heart is sincere, and I hope the world will recognize it. Comrades, those who wish to sign agreements and issue declarations in other countries, listen. I do not believe in words on paper. I believe in all of you. (2nd day Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Warning Poland Not to Take Risks</p>
<p>In his speech, Hitler also issued a warning to Poland, saying that those who are prepared to take risks for the benefit of a major country should also be prepared to eat the consequences. In any case, we will not tolerate it if other countries impose a policy of intimidation or a policy of encirclement on our country. Our country has now decided to protect its rights that are vital to its survival, which cannot be obstructed by any group. (Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Speech Broadcast Once Interrupted <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The speech delivered by Führer Hitler at Wilhelmshaven today has been secretly preserved by the authorities through extraordinary measures. When the head of state spoke, the first section was broadcast by radio, but it was immediately suspended. At the same time, the authorities notified journalists from various countries that they were not allowed to leave their seats before the end of the speech. The reporters originally thought that the head of state had made shocking remarks, but after listening to the entire speech, they did not find anything particularly exciting. Observers from various countries who had once felt uneasy were greatly relieved. As for why the broadcast was suddenly interrupted, it is still a mystery. Some people believe that the authorities originally did not want to broadcast the head of state's speech. Various radio stations directly broadcast it, which was due to a misunderstanding, so it was temporarily stopped. Later, at 7:00 PM, the authorities handed over the recorded phonograph record of the head of state's speech to various radio stations across the country for broadcast. (1st day Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e22">Aiming to Defend Against Aggression; England's Current Policy Remains Unwavering; Anti-Aggression Group Indirectly Includes United States and Soviet Union; If Germany Has Sincere Intention to Disarm, England Is Willing to Reopen Negotiations <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>British political figures responded to the speech delivered by German Führer Hitler today with a very calm attitude, saying that Hitler's intention is to stabilize German public opinion. Although he focused on criticizing England, England's current policy should still aim to defend against aggression and will not waver because of it. However, if Germany is willing to reduce its armaments and abandon its intimidating tactics, then England is also prepared to reopen negotiations with it to discuss disarmament. As for the anti-aggression group currently being planned by various countries, it will indirectly include the United States and the Soviet Union. In other words, when war breaks out in the future, the United States and the Soviet Union do not have to join the democratic front to fight together, but they will supply unlimited arms and raw materials to the democratic countries, so that they will maintain an absolute advantage in armaments.

<p>Berlin Newspapers Comment One After Another</p>
<p>(Berlin) The speech delivered by Führer Hitler yesterday has recently been commented on by various newspapers, which all said that this is Germany's response to England's policy of encircling the country. The German Summary Report used the headline "How the Space for Germany's Survival Is Relevant Has Nothing to Do with England." The Anglo-German Naval Agreement has now become a problem. The Public Observation Report stated that "The head of state has replied and settled old accounts. Germany's strength cannot be defeated by any country in the world. The head of state has also announced to England that whether the Anglo-German Naval Agreement can continue to exist should be determined by whether the prerequisites for the establishment of this agreement can be maintained." The Local Guidance Report stated, "The head of state's speech yesterday still leaves England a period of consideration. We should wait quietly for a reply. If the country's anti-German attitude is not changed, we should know what to do." The Hamburg Foreign Affairs Report stated, "Germany has politically maintained great authority. The scope of its new policies should be determined by itself and cannot be interfered with by others." (2nd day Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>London Believes It Is Intentional Humiliation</p>
<p>(London) Today, British officials believe that Hitler's speech actually contains the meaning of accepting England's challenge, which will continue its ambition to expand its territory in Europe. Every point in Hitler's speech is intended to humiliate England. (2nd day Associated Press)</p>
<p>Italian Newspaper Defends Germany and Attacks England</p>
<p>Milan: Italian newspapers expressed a very friendly impression of Hitler's speech, while the Fascist System Report satirized England and criticized it severely, saying that England is willing to guarantee Poland's independence. Reflecting on the past, we cannot help but worry for Poland. Why? Haven't you seen Abyssinia, Czechoslovakia, and the Spanish Republican Government? After England and France came forward to guarantee them, the gods of misfortune followed one after another. The world has those who encourage other countries to fight bravely but themselves never help others to fight. Poland should be wary of this. (2nd day Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Sweet Words, Poisoned Heart; Poland Anesthetized</p>
<p>Warsaw: There is great interest here in Hitler's speech. Although there were many critical remarks about England in the speech, the listener naturally paid attention with joy because he repeatedly declared that Germany has the aspiration to maintain peace. Furthermore, Hitler also named the 1939 National Socialist Party Congress the National Socialist Party Peace Congress. In contrast, it can be seen that Hitler also uses peace as a slogan. (2nd day Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Political figures here have shown great attention to Hitler's speech, but because there is nothing directly involving Poland in the speech, they are unwilling to comment on it. However, because Hitler solemnly declared his aspiration to support peace, they have a generally good impression of his speech. (2nd day Haitong News Agency)</p>

<p>(Paris) After German leader Hitler's speech yesterday, although the French newspapers were quite comforted, they still expressed great doubts. The right-wing "Paris Echo" reported, "Since the Munich Conference, Leader Hitler has spoken extravagantly of peace, never so resolutely as now. Whether this speech can reassure the people is unknown, but it is a sign nonetheless. However, his intentions toward Poland are not without threat, and we should be seriously vigilant." "Le Petit Parisien" reported that Hitler stated that if countries wish to impose policies of intimidation or encirclement on Germany, he will never tolerate it; this is a threat to those countries willing to aid Poland. "Le Temps" reported that Hitler claimed that the National Socialist Party Congress scheduled for September would be called the "Peace Congress," intending to anesthetize us so that he can take action again in a short period. "Fortunately, the matter of collective security organization is progressing smoothly. If peace-loving countries wish to save themselves, there is no other way." "L'Ordre" reported, "As of today, Germany almost certainly understands that any act of violence is sufficient to immediately provoke war and place the country in an unfavorable position. For the sake of the country, there are only two paths to follow: one is to provoke war before Britain and France complete their rearmament plans; the other is to delay, to work calmly, hoping for a comeback. Judging from Hitler's speech, Germany has probably taken the second path." (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>United States: Words Quite Ambiguous, Situation Does Not Permit Optimism</p>
<p>(New York) American newspapers recently commented on Hitler's speech, generally saying that after Britain issued a warning, Germany's attitude has become hesitant. The "New York Evening Post" reported, "Leader Hitler has been ambiguous on certain points, and the tone of the Italian side is also quite mild, which shows that the stance adopted by various democratic countries is strong and effective." The "New York Times" reported that Leader Hitler did not address Po-</p>

<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull this morning telegraphed the Spanish Nationalist government, informing them that the United States is prepared to establish diplomatic relations with the Nationalist government. He then issued a statement to the newspapers, briefly saying that after studying the various facts in Spain, the government decided to recognize the Nationalist government. The first ambassadorial candidate has not yet been decided. Political figures recently commented, saying that as of yesterday morning, Secretary of State Hull had no intention of recognizing the Nationalist government; it was not until after a long-distance telephone conversation with President Roosevelt last night that the decision was made. Moreover, this decision was announced before the Nationalist government's reply telegram arrived, which is contrary to custom. President Roosevelt recently issued a public announcement from Warm Springs, which stated: "A resolution passed by Congress on January 8, 1937, declared that a civil war had broken out in Spain. Now that the civil war in that country has ended, the circumstances under which the order issued on May 1, 1937, prohibiting the shipment of arms to that country, no longer exist.

The parliamentary side has paid great attention, saying that although Canadians oppose conscription, they do not refuse to help Britain. Those familiar with the matter say that if the Canadian Federation does not act in concert with the British Empire, it will be isolated, which is well known to Canadians. Therefore, if war breaks out in Europe in the future, it will help Britain with all its resources and send volunteer troops and technical personnel. As for the extent of the assistance, it will be announced when the war breaks out. As far as the current situation is concerned, Quebec is strongly opposed to conscription, so the federal government authorities have to be extremely cautious. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>

Foreign Minister Beck is expected to pass through Berlin in the evening and arrive at Ostend, Belgium, tomorrow morning to transfer to a ship, arriving in London at 4:20 PM in the afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, is about to arrive in London to hold talks with the British authorities. The Sunday Times recently commented on it, saying that the goal of these talks is to conclude a "Mutual Guarantee Treaty" between Britain and Poland, and Britain intends to lend Poland £20 million as a huge sum to expand its military. At the same time, the two issues of Jewish emigration from Poland and the Free City of Danzig will also be raised for discussion. In short, the goal is for all countries that have decided to resist German aggression to unite with each other, in other words, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Poland, Yugoslavia, Turkey and Greece to unite with each other and form a unified front as a plan for self-preservation, in which Turkey is very important, because if a war breaks out in the future, the British fleet's activities in the eastern Mediterranean will depend on the ports of Turkey. The Observer reported that "No matter what excuse Germany makes, if it attempts to interfere with or change the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Poland, the Polish government will resist with force. However, the situation in the Free City of Danzig is different, and it cannot be regarded as Polish territory. On the contrary, the Polish Corridor is an integral part of the country's entire territory. In this sense, if Germany wants to incorporate the city of Danzig into East Prussia, it cannot be regarded as an act of aggression, but if Germany wants to connect East Prussia with the western provinces of the country, thereby infringing on the Polish Corridor, then Britain and France will fulfill the guarantee they have provided and intervene. However, the key to their actions will still depend on whether Poland resists Germany. At that time, if Poland repeats the mistakes of Austria and Czechoslovakia and enters Germany's urn, then Britain and France will of course not want to stand up and only stand by and watch."

Once relations between Germany and Poland ease, Britain will extend the guarantees it currently provides to Poland to other countries in Central and Southeastern Europe. The Italian government did not reject this suggestion, but said that the actions of the United Kingdom should not be aimed at encircling Germany, otherwise Italy would firmly oppose it. Political figures here also said that whether the current contacts between Britain and Italy can achieve something will depend on Germany's attitude and the demands it makes of Poland. However, Italy does not intend to initiate a Central and Southeast European security system, and unless the various demands made by France are met one day, Europe will not be able to ensure peace for a day.

<p>Polish People's Anti-German Movement: Germany Makes False Propaganda</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National News Agency received news from the Katowice province of Poland, claiming that two German consulate personnel there were beaten by Poles and seriously injured. It also said that the owner of a German printing bureau in Karvin, a German national, was also beaten by Poles for speaking German and was receiving medical treatment. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Responsible persons here recently refuted the news issued the other day by the Deutsche Nachrichtenbüro, a semi-official German agency, that employees of the German consulate in Shenyang were beaten by Poles, saying that they knew nothing about it. However, the vigorous propaganda campaign carried out by the Germanic peoples in Poland, claiming that they have been subjected to abuse, or have been exploited by the German side, is quite worrying. Those in political circles say that the German tribal media are collecting various dispute information and issuing a list every week. The so-called disputes are probably Poles and Germanic peoples fighting each other, or Germans being punished for disturbing public order, and Polish officials prohibiting National Socialist Party meetings, and so on. These trivial matters, which no one paid attention to in the past, are now being exaggerated by the German side. Peering into their intentions, they probably want to use this to oppress Poland, just like the previous oppression of other countries. German Ambassador Moltke visited Foreign Minister Beck on March 29 to protest the anti-German movement in Bydgoszcz (March 26 incident). Although this issue did not have any developments afterwards, Poland's determination to resist Germany can be seen in the arrest of Von Funk, a reporter for the German News Agency stationed in Bydgoszcz (a German national but a Polish citizen), for sending false news.

<p>Loubet Memorial Unveiling Ceremony: French President Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Montélimar, France: President Lebrun presided over the unveiling ceremony of the memorial to the late President Loubet here this morning. Although it was raining heavily, the majority of the people still enthusiastically participated. President Lebrun immediately delivered a speech, praising President Loubet's political achievements during his lifetime. He said that this man achieved many achievements at home and abroad during his tenure. In terms of domestic affairs, the unity of the whole nation has been achieved. In terms of foreign affairs, he finally enabled France to achieve relations with the nations and allied countries. He recalled that when he visited Russia in 1902, the Franco-Russian alliance treaty was completed because of this, and then visited Britain in 1903, and the Entente Cordiale was also established. Later, in 1904, he visited Italy, and France and Italy increased their friendship as a result. As for President Lebrun's participation in the general election, he did not say a word about it.

<p>Siamese Military Reorganization is Purely for Self-Defense, Willing to Abide by Treaty Obligations, Maintain Friendship with Friendly Nations</p>
<p>Bangkok: Siamese Foreign Minister said here recently that the Siamese military reorganization program is purely for national defense purposes. If war breaks out in Europe, Siam is unwilling to take aggressive action against any neighboring country. British and French inspection teams recently came to Siam and expressed their goodwill. They must have realized that Siam is a peaceful country. Since the world is reorganizing its troops, Siam has no choice but to follow suit. However, Siam is doing this for no other reason than self-defense, and has no intention of aggression. Siam has concluded new treaties with thirteen countries, and Siam strictly abides by treaty obligations, so it has won the name of law-abiding country. Siam has never concluded a secret treaty with any foreign country. Siam is sparsely populated. It hopes that other countries will respect the natural desire of the Siamese people to pass on their country to their descendants and give them due respect. Siam is prepared to abide by international agreements and is willing to express its due fairness and goodwill to all friendly nations. The crowd believed that the foreign minister's remarks were in response to rumors that if war broke out in Europe, Siam would try to take advantage of the opportunity. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Belgian Parliamentary Re-election Completed: Ancient Hatreds Between the Two Tribes Released: Foreign Troubles Promote Unity</p>
<p>Brussels: The re-election of the Senate and House of Representatives was held this morning. 202 members of the House of Representatives and 101 members of the Senate were elected. It has been completed by 1:00 PM. The process was very calm. The election results will be announced tomorrow night. Since Dr. Martens (who was sentenced to death for treason during the European War, then fled to the Netherlands, and then returned to Belgium under amnesty) was appointed as a researcher at the Royal Flemish Academy of Medicine, it was generally believed that the Flemish and Walloon tribes would have fierce competition during the election. Because of the events in Central Europe, the tribes abandoned their hatreds and spoke well of each other. Even the far-right Flemish National Party advocated tribal unity and issued a declaration today, briefly saying, "We do not want to be oppressed by the Walloons, and we do not want to be oppressed by Germany." If German leader Hitler attacks Belgium, we will stand on the first line of defense and resist. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Brussels: Official circles recently announced that Dr. Martens has resigned from his position as a researcher at the Royal Flemish Academy of Medicine, and the dispute between the Flemish and Walloon tribes can be resolved as a result. According to reports, Dr. Martens was sentenced to death for treason during the European War and then fled to the Netherlands without being executed. Then, during the tenure of former Prime Minister Zeller, he was allowed to return to Belgium under amnesty for political prisoners. It was not until February of this year that former Prime Minister Spaak appointed him as a researcher at the Royal Academy of Medicine. At that time, Walloon people, including the Liberal Party and war veterans, rose up in opposition. Spaak was even beaten and injured, causing a political storm, and the Spaak cabinet had to resign. Later, the de Broqueville cabinet still failed to resolve the matter and dissolved the parliament last month, until now. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>British and Swedish Negotiation of a Commercial Agreement: Based on Free Trade</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: British Secretary for Overseas Trade Hudson recently arrived here from the Swedish capital of Finland and will work with the Swedish government authorities to negotiate a commercial agreement based on free trade and without barter methods, just like the ones he negotiated in Poland, the Soviet Union, and Finland. This trip has no political connection and will return to London by plane on the 4th of this month to complete commercial negotiations while taking advantage of the visit of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to the United Kingdom. He recently told reporters that he had visited Poland, the Soviet Union, and Finland and that the process was extremely satisfactory. The Soviet Union and Finland will send commercial delegations to London in a short period of time to formally conduct commercial negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>

The detailed measures are as follows: (1) Each member shall complete one inspection cycle of the designated county every six months, and the inspection date shall be reported to the provincial government meeting in advance. (2) During the inspection period, each department shall dispatch one senior official to accompany the member. (3) Matters handled by each member during the inspection period shall be promptly notified to the provincial government and the relevant departments, and important matters shall be submitted to the meeting for retroactive approval. (4) Upon arriving at the counties, each member shall first console the people, collect as many local opinions as possible, convene public speeches at any time, demonstrate the government's determination to resist the war, and guide local self-defense strategies.

<h3 id="e33">North China Issues "Federal Reserve" Currency, Japanese Attempts All Fail, Allowing Exchange Will Weaken the Yen Further, Restricting Exchange Will Halt Commerce <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Zi Lin Bao, Tianjin, March 24th: The "provisional government" of North China's financial order stipulating that each yuan of the Federal Reserve Bank currency is equal to one shilling and two pence has proven to be almost absurd due to the recent declaration by the Japanese Finance Minister to the Diet's budget committee that the yen will inevitably have to inflate. Currently, the financial situation in North China is chaotic.</p>
<p>The import and export trade is adversely affected as a result. This proves the truth of the saying "each acts on their own." The adoption of the new currency in North China was originally initiated by the Japanese military without regard to the strong advice of Japanese financiers. But if Japanese bankers try to influence the military strategy of the Japanese army in China, what kind of uproar will these soldiers make? At first glance, the adoption of a completely new currency in North China seems like a good financial strategy that can achieve four different goals in one fell swoop: (1) to crush the Chinese legal currency and inflict a fatal blow on the Chiang Kai-shek government politically and financially; (2) to issue worthless paper money to help pay for military expenses, and the Chinese people must exchange goods for this paper money; (3) to use this as a starting point to bring China into the yen bloc; (4) to enable the Japanese army to obtain the foreign exchange it urgently needs through the export of North China's products. Even those with less financial knowledge will immediately see that several of these goals are mutually contradictory. The</p>
<p>most serious</p>
<p>problem is that the soldiers who support this plan obviously did not consider the various resistances they would inevitably encounter. They probably thought they could force the oppressed people to accept the new currency, but later they seemed to be mixing war and finance into one, and believed that they could use bayonets to give this new currency real value. What is said above is at least the only explanation for their implementation of this policy. If the Federal Reserve Bank has been supported by the Chinese public, and has thus tried to establish a strong reserve, the new currency may have achieved satisfactory results. However, this has not been realized. The only support the new bank has received is the vague guarantee from a Japanese banking group to supply a small amount of funds. Therefore, the Federal Reserve Bank is actually just a</p>
<p>front organization.</p>
<p>What happened was that Japan poured yen notes into North China, but this yen note was given a different name for disguise. This can be proven by the fact that Japanese banks had to refuse to freely exchange large amounts of Federal Reserve currency for yen when this was first implemented. Free exchange would inevitably weaken the yen in Japan. However, if you want to establish a yen bloc, free exchange between these two currencies is necessary. In short, one of their four goals has failed so far. There has been a lot of noise from the Japanese military regarding the refusal of North China's foreign exchange banks to sell foreign exchange in Federal Reserve currency, accusing it of being a prank. They even claimed that</p>
<p>these currencies</p>
<p>have not yet obtained the correct value that they believe they deserve because they cannot buy foreign exchange. If the Japanese side stipulates that the new currency has the same value as the Chinese legal currency, then the Japanese army's complaints may have some basis. However, the official price of the yen is one shilling and two pence, so of course it cannot be less than this. If the Japanese side does this, then the new currency has been linked to the legal currency, not to the yen. Therefore, one yuan of the Federal Reserve Bank's currency is set at a price of one shilling and two pence, but North China's exporters who buy goods with currency worth eight pence obviously have no hope of competing with the world market if they are forced to buy goods with currency worth one shilling and two pence. As a result, the export trade came to a standstill, and the Japanese army did not obtain any of the foreign exchange left over from the export industry. Thus, another goal also failed. The Japanese now seem to be in a dilemma. Whether or not an order is issued, the Federal Reserve Bank's currency will fall along with the yen. Making the Federal Reserve Bank's currency closely follow the yen and restricting the free exchange between these two currencies will inevitably cause import and export trade to come to a standstill. If unlimited exchange is allowed, then it will inevitably cause the yen to continue to weaken.</p>

<p>Sixth, the coordination of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla warfare alone is not enough. It is necessary to simultaneously use mobile warfare, constantly annihilate the enemy, and cause the enemy greater losses. Only when the enemy's forces are not enough to allocate in such a large area of the country can they only guard a few strongholds and cannot maintain control over a vast area. Seventh, we believe that in the future, military and political command must be unified, so that military and political affairs meet the requirements of our war. In order to facilitate the war, political and military cooperation must be consistent. Eighth, economically blockade the enemy, and we must have a way to be self-sufficient. We believe that in terms of the trend of such a war and the enemy's dynamics, these principles and policies must be adopted to win the victory in the future war and the development and completion of the second stage of the war, so as to quickly prepare our forces and strive for the rapid arrival of our counter-offensive stage.</p>
<p>Final conclusion: Our conclusion is very simple. It is a combination of three conclusions into one general conclusion.</p>
<p>A. Based on the experience of the Anti-Japanese War over the past year, we should: (1) Develop the achievements and advantages we have gained in this year. (2) Correct the shortcomings that exist in our Anti-Japanese War this year.</p>
<p>B. Based on the lessons of the past year, we should: (1) Strengthen our political work and maximize the effectiveness of our political work. (2) Continuously improve our military technology to the necessary extent to meet the requirements of our operations. (3) Thoroughly eliminate the habits of guerrillaism and make our army completely regular. (4) Based on this lesson, consolidate and improve various systems, so that our army becomes the most flexible and most effective machine.</p>
<p>C. Based on the trend of future operations, we should: (1) Learn mobile warfare to combine guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare. (2) We must organize and launch guerrilla warfare among the masses everywhere. (3) Strengthen our publicity work and mass movement. (4) We must develop enemy army work (i.e., propaganda to the enemy army and strive for their rebellion) among the entire army, and turn it into the common work of all our combatants, and at the same time turn it into the anti-Japanese work of the broad masses. (5) Maintain and develop the excellent traditions of our New Fourth Army. And we must create our new excellent traditions and style. This is how we adapt to the combat missions of the twenty-eighth year, the anti-Japanese missions of the second stage, and complete the missions of the second stage. Only in this way can we become healthier day by day and overcome our weaknesses day by day. Our summary of the experience and lessons of the past year is not only to find out our achievements, but mainly to recognize where our achievements come from, and at the same time find out our weaknesses, what hinders us in the Anti-Japanese War, and how to overcome them? So that we become the healthiest and most powerful anti-Japanese army, so that we can make greater contributions in the second stage of the Anti-Japanese War and have greater victories to complete our mission!

The preparatory committee has now made appropriate allocations and can issue all of them this afternoon (3rd). However, since there are currently many child welfare organizations, and the number of refugee children is more than 40,000, it may be impossible to distribute them universally. The preparatory committee will handle the situation at its discretion.</p>
<p>Issuance of Passes</p>
<p>The total number of children who have signed up to visit the gardens this year is 9,397. All amusement park passes will be issued by the Shanghai Office of the Child Welfare Association starting at 2:00 p.m. today (3rd). Please send personnel from various organizations to collect them. When visiting the park, all children must strictly abide by the park rules. Yesterday's newspaper reported that ten major theaters were offering preferential treatment to refugee children to watch movies. It is now learned that the Huguang Theater is also preparing to entertain refugee children with the screening of the film "Miss Tomboy." The theater plans to entertain 1,200 refugee children. Therefore, the total number of refugee children watching free movies this year is 8,700. All movie tickets are scheduled to be issued by the preparatory committee this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Guangxi Province Authorities Set This Year as Guangxi Province Adult Education Year, Implementation Plan Already Set <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) Guangxi Province has designated the 28th year of the Republic of China as the "Adult Education Year" and has formulated an implementation plan for the Adult Education Year. Since 1934, Guangxi Province has combined compulsory education for children with adult literacy education into "National Basic Education" and has taken on the task of eliminating illiteracy. Therefore, the number of illiterates has gradually decreased. According to statistics, in 1935, there were a total of 3,369,999 out-of-school adults aged 18 to 45 in the province, accounting for 58% of the 5,777,287 adults in the province. In the past four years, a total of 1,550,425 people have been reduced. As of the end of 1938, only 1,863,995 people remained. According to this statistic, the total reduction in four years was more than 46%. The "Adult Education Year" aims to eliminate the remaining adult illiterates, which account for more than 55%. (The reason why the percentage exceeds 100% is that the rate at which children become adult illiterates is higher than the mortality rate of adult illiterates). As for the implementation plan, there are a total of 19 chapters and 64 articles. The 19 chapters are titled: Main Purpose, Objectives, Implementation Principles, Organization Setup and Equipment, Enrollment and Staffing, Teachers, Curriculum and Teaching Materials, Teaching, Guidance, Graduation, Continuing Education, Special Ethnic Group Education, Supervision, Assessment, Funding, Implementation Procedures, Summary, and Supplementary Provisions. In addition, the following methods are also stipulated: (1) Students must be pure illiterates aged 18 to 45 who have never attended school or who have attended school but cannot understand the texts of volumes 1 and 2 of the People's School textbook. (2) Teaching adopts a class system, with a minimum of 25 people and a maximum of 50 people per class. Classes should be separated by gender in principle. Each county should hold at least two "Exemplary Adult Classes." Students should not only use coercive methods to enroll, but also use lotteries in stages, with four terms per year, each term lasting two months, and classes lasting two hours per day. Adult classes should be established by national basic schools at all levels, private secondary schools above the county level, and local cultural and industrial groups, and existing equipment should be used as much as possible. (3) There are five types of courses: 1. Anti-Japanese Speech; 2. National Language; 3. Current Affairs Reports; 4. Anti-Japanese Songs; 5. Assembly Activities. (4) Guidance standards are divided into: Political New Life Movement, Propaganda Work, Production Knowledge and Skills, Rescue Training, and Special Training for Women. (5) There are four sources of teachers: 1. Transfer the directors of the guidance departments of the central basic schools; 2. Transfer teachers from basic schools at all levels; 3. Transfer surplus teachers from each county who have been adjusted according to the Guangxi Province Wartime Basic Education Implementation Measures; 4. If the number of people dispatched from the above items is insufficient, then public officials and intellectuals will be dispatched to supplement the number. According to the above total number of illiterates, which is 1,863,995, assuming 40 per class, there are a total of 46,600 classes. Divided into four terms, there are 11,700 classes per term. Stipulating that each teacher teaches two classes, there are a total of 5,850 teachers needed. There are 2,291 directors of guidance at the central basic schools. The main teachers from the third source above are exempt from the obligation to perform corvée labor and military service during their service period. (6) The budget for expenses is 92,200 yuan for office expenses, 233,000 yuan for teacher subsidies (5 yuan for each completed class), and 355,900 yuan for teacher living expenses (10 yuan per person per month, calculated for ten months), plus travel expenses for provincial supervisors and reserve expenses, totaling 931,100 yuan, with an average cost of 20 yuan per class and a cost of 5 jiao to eliminate one illiterate. Textbooks are separate. Last year, the Ministry issued 3 million sets of People's School textbooks, and students also provide their own stationery. At the beginning of the event, teachers are trained first. Each county concentrates on its own, with a week as the duration. The training subjects are: Adult Education Notes, Mass Organization and Training, How the Masses Resist Japan, Outline of Anti-Japanese Propaganda, Outline of Guangxi Construction, Spiritual Speech, Anti-Japanese Songs, Air Defense and Poison Prevention, etc. There are three levels of promotion agencies: 1. Provincial Government; 2. Commanders of the People's Regiments in each district; 3. County Government. In addition, the province has established a "Provincial Adult Education Year Promotion Committee" and the county has established a "County Promotion Committee" to be responsible for the design and promotion of adult education in the province and county. As for the adult education methods for special ethnic groups such as the Miao and Yao, "Guangxi has special ethnic groups such as the Miao, Yao, Dong, and Zhuang, totaling more than 300,000, scattered in 49 counties (excluding the Zhuang, who number more than 5 million, accounting for about five-thirteenths of the province's population, but because they have been deeply assimilated by the Han people, only the language is different, so they are not regarded as a particularly serious problem). They live in poverty, and most of them have languages but no writing. Several years ago, a special teacher training institute was established, but the teachers trained are not enough to distribute. The initial step in eliminating the illiterate of special ethnic groups with low culture and different languages is to start with teaching Chinese characters, so that they feel that learning foreign languages is the same. I am afraid there will be problems if they can go through it." It will be formulated separately, and it has not yet been formulated. For adult illiterates from special ethnic groups, because the problems of teaching materials and writing are greater than economic problems, it is not a problem of Guangxi Province alone. The Ministry of Education should be asked to invite experts in ethnic, language, writing education, and other aspects to jointly discuss effective solutions.</p>

<p>Chairman of Zhejiang Province Increases Funding for Western Zhejiang Middle School</p>
<p>Sends a Telegram to the Central Government Requesting Disaster Relief Funds</p>
<p>Zhejiang Correspondence: The enrollment of the Temporary Middle School in Western Zhejiang has already passed, but young people from the war zone and guerrilla zone, regardless of whether the enrollment time has passed or not, and regardless of whether they are admitted or not, are always coming in droves. The problems have therefore arisen. First, the original quota has long been exceeded. Second, there is no way to get funding. The salaries of teachers and staff have been reduced again and again. Up to now, not a penny has been paid, and in fact, it still cannot be spent. Third, even student accommodation and meals cannot be solved. Recently, Provincial Chairman Huang went to the school to observe the various difficult situations and expressed his great emotion. He has approved the school authorities' request to prepare to increase funding, so as to accommodate as many out-of-school young people as possible and train a large number of new cadres. At the same time, he also ordered the county magistrates of the war zone and guerrilla zone to encourage young people with achievements in the war zone to study in the rear as much as possible. Regarding disaster relief funds, in addition to the assistance provided by the province, a telegram was sent to the Central Disaster Relief Committee to request assistance. In addition, Provincial Inspector Chen Chuanwen also went to Yuqian the day before yesterday to visit the school and observe.</p>

The strength of the two sides is very different. Youxing will be able to win easily. The second game is between Gongnüzhong and Su Keer. The former is currently the leader in the second division. Su Keer has had mixed results since the start of the season. A fierce battle may occur between the two sides. The last game is between Zhengxin and Adixue. Adixue's results are the same as Gongnüzhong, with two wins in two games. Zhengxin has only lost one game to Gongnüzhong. This meeting is expected to be exciting. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Youxing vs. Peide (Women's 1) 7:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Gongnüzhong vs. Su Keer (Women's 2) 8:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Adixue vs. Zhengxin (Women's 2) 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Arts Sports Congress has broken past records in terms of the number of participants, and the situation is unprecedented. Yesterday, Chu Minyi donated many valuable prizes. Since this National Arts Sports Congress is charitable in nature, the sales of tickets from all parties have been excellent. Unfortunately, the weather was not good. There were continuous cloudy and rainy nights the day before yesterday and yesterday. Yesterday morning, there were also drizzling rain, so it was decided to postpone it to this Sunday (April 9th), starting at 9:00 a.m., still at the private Shanghai Middle School at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road. The tickets that have been sold are still valid. The staff of the conference and all the contestants were also notified separately yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. by the Commercial Radio Station (wave 1060).</p>
<h3 id="e38">Yesterday's Triangle Cross-Country Race: Dispute Arises; Runners Go Astray; Re-run on the 9th of This Month <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The second "Shun Kee Cup" cross-country triangle race, with participants from the Huizhen, Hongkou, and French Army teams, started at 7:30 yesterday morning in the rain in front of Minzhi Middle School. Huizhen won the championship with absolute dominance, with team members Liu Guangfa, Huang Jinfu, and Lin Guoyou taking the top three places. Hongkou's Wan Jinsheng finished fourth. However, after the race, the French Army team reported that Huizhen's Ma Riji, between Daxilu and Haigelu, went via Yidingpanlu. Two French Army team members also committed the same violation. The French Army dispatched two military vehicles for support along the route, and an ambulance followed. However, the ambulance mistakenly took the wrong route, and Ma Riji and the two French Army team members followed the ambulance, leading them astray. According to the rules, all three were disqualified. After reviewing the team scores, Huizhen had less than 30 points. The difference between Hongkou and the French Army was significant, so Huizhen should retain the championship title. However, due to the aforementioned incident, both sides held their own positions, almost leading to unpleasantness. Later, the race organizer, Liang Yaoting, mediated the situation and explained that the dispute was actually caused by the French Army's ambulance. To emphasize sportsmanship and preserve friendly relations, this race was treated as a practice race. The scores for all three teams were not counted, and a re-run was scheduled for the 9th (Sunday) at the same location.</p>
<p>Youth Basketball Competition</p>

<p>The St. John's University John Drama Society originally scheduled to perform "Moonlight" on the 8th and 9th of this month to raise funds for unenrolled children. However, because the 9th is Easter, the drama society, adhering to the school's Christian spirit, cannot perform on that day. It is reported that the Tianxia Drama Society has agreed to substitute for the John Drama Society and perform "Moonlight" on the 9th. Tickets are priced at five, three, two, and one yuan, and all proceeds, excluding theater rental costs, will be used to support children. (Note: The script for "Moonlight" is published by Zhulin Bookstore at Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, and is priced at three jiao per copy.)</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Yen and the Sword <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Te Gong</p>
<p>This article was written by Mr. Guenther Stein in Hong Kong at the end of last year, originally titled "The Yen and the Sword" in "Pacific Affairs," published in March of this year. The journal just arrived in Shanghai and was reprinted in "The China Weekly Review" published on April 1st. The fact that it was reprinted demonstrates its importance. Now, we are grateful to Mr. Wu Te Gong of this newspaper for taking the time to translate it for this publication. Mr. Wu's translations have long been praised, and he is known as a famous translator of renowned works. This publication convened a symposium of monetary experts on this issue the previous week. The minutes of that meeting were published in the previous issue of this publication. Now, we are adding an outsider's perspective on this issue, which can be even more beneficial. We hope readers will pay attention! Unfortunately, due to the limited space of this publication, it can only be published in two installments. We hope the translator and readers will forgive us. Editor</p>
<p>The previous issue of this publication contained a record of the symposium discussing the issue of Japanese control of finance in North China, which was well-received by readers. Now, we have come across an article on the same topic by the famous American economic journalist Gueuther Steiu, which is sufficient to supplement the opinions expressed by the gentlemen at the symposium that day. We have hastily translated it and present it below. Reading this article, it can be seen that Japan's war against China, even if it does not fail due to major military setbacks, will inevitably fail due to economic helplessness. As long as China can persevere in the war of resistance and never give up until the final victory is achieved, there is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>Monetary Skirmishes Before the Sino-Japanese War</p>
<p>Currency has proven to be one of the decisive weapons in this Sino-Japanese War. Although many close observers of the war have underestimated the importance of currency, both China and Japan have long understood this fact. The Sino-Japanese currency war had been actively underway for approximately two years before actual military hostilities broke out. In early 1935, the Japanese took the offensive, attempting to link the currency of North China to the "Yen Bloc." They fully expected that the five major northern provinces could be separated from the central government by this method, and that Japan could completely conquer them without shedding a single drop of blood or firing a single bullet. They imposed this tactic on the unwilling nation not only with diplomatic and military pressure, but also by exploiting various chaotic political activities in the north. Originally, China's old silver currency was in a dangerous state, and the Japanese felt that there was ample opportunity to take direct aggressive action in the financial market. The method they adopted was to engage in looting China's silver, which was the legal tender in its northern provinces.</p>
<p>Therefore, Japan sent personnel to North China to purchase silver coins and silver bars at abnormally low exchange rates against foreign currencies. Under the careful guidance of the local Japanese authorities, this was carried out smoothly and yielded substantial results. Although the Chinese government had issued a ban on the export of silver, it was ultimately unable to stop the smuggling of silver to Japan. The total amount transported to Japan was not recorded in official import reports. However, once it arrived in Japan, it could be openly transferred to England. According to Japanese foreign trade statistics, a total of 275 million yen worth of silver was transported to England from 1934 to 1936. Needless to say, this silver all came from China, as Japan is not a silver-producing country. After the silver arrived in London, it was sold at the high world market price maintained by the US government's silver purchasing policy, yielding substantial profits. However, the profit-making aspect was a coincidence. The true motive behind Japan's movement was not to seek profit, but to loot the deeply rooted monetary reserves of North China, making it unable to maintain its financial position, and then forcing it to fall into the grasp of the "Yen Bloc," and in the future, gradually dispose of the entire China in the same way.</p>
<p>Although this attack caused great losses to China, it failed to achieve Japan's main goal. Because the Chinese government responded decisively and suddenly implemented currency reform on November 3, 1935. Although this measure was somewhat late, it was still a remedial action. As a result, silver was completely nationalized and no longer served as legal tender, nor was it allowed to circulate on the market. Instead, paper money issued by government banks was used as a substitute. In other words, China had adopted a "managed" currency to avoid Japanese attacks, as most other countries had done before. China immediately set about collecting all the silver still remaining in the country. The government was able to collect at least one hundred million yuan (Chinese currency). China had therefore taken a step ahead of Japan. Because this silver could not only serve as a hard currency reserve for the new paper money in peacetime, but also serve as a potential emergency fund in times of war, freely disposed of by the government for purchasing military supplies overseas.</p>
<p>China's logical counter-actions in the undeclared currency war, especially the latter, made the Japanese greatly uneasy. As a result, Japan's political attitude towards China and Britain turned sharply. The reason why she hated Britain was because it was rumored that China's counter-actions were instigated by Britain. At first, Japan firmly believed that China's currency reform would fail in the short term from a purely economic perspective. She believed that China was a backward, only semi-unified, and unmanageable country. The government's power and credibility were insufficient to successfully implement the modern state-managed currency. Furthermore, the Chinese people had been accustomed to using silver for thousands of years. Now, suddenly asking them to switch to paper money, which could be used to purchase foreign exchange but could not be exchanged for cash, would not gain their trust. Although the Chinese government's reform had averted a monetary crisis, new crises would soon arise, even more severe than the previous one. At that time, the "Yen Bloc" would have all sorts of unexpected opportunities for expansion. Who knew that China's currency reform would proceed smoothly and achieve remarkable results? As a result, the general economic progress was so rapid that it exceeded the Chinese government's expectations. When this reform had clearly become a tool used by the Chinese government to rapidly increase national political unity and overseas credit, panic in some aspects of Japan grew.</p>
<p>The Amazing Power of Legal Tender in the War of Resistance</p>
<p>It would be an exaggeration to say that Japan's decision to launch an armed invasion of China was entirely due to the effects of China's currency reform, but history will prove that this was a major reason for Japan's war. Because the ambition to incorporate vast areas of China into the "Yen Bloc," although certainly not the sole purpose of Japan's operations in China, often surfaced in her plans for the future, and was greater than generally imagined. Japan's great military machine was ultimately engaged in large-scale movements in China. The currency weapon was of course crucial at the moment, but it was not shelved for long. Japan never forgot her original purpose. Therefore, after the establishment of the new puppet regime in Beiping, the first two plans she urged to implement were intended to lay the foundation for the expansion of the "Yen Bloc" in the occupied areas: (1) The establishment of the "United Reserve Bank of China," so that the paper money it issued would depend on the yen; (2) The promulgation of new tax rules to reduce population taxes, facilitating the expansion of Japanese trade within the new sphere of influence of the yen.</p>
<p>China also greatly relied on the fighting value of the newly forged currency weapon. Initially, for purely financial and self-defense reasons, silver was nationalized, and the resulting war fund, which was at least equal to half of the gold reserves of the Bank of Japan, was fully controlled and utilized by the government. This is a major factor in China's ability to exert the amazing ability to resist for a long time. But China also knew how to use the currency weapon itself to defend itself, and defended it very thoroughly. Wherever the Chinese regular army encountered the Japanese army, which had superior equipment, and had to retreat, in addition to leaving many guerrillas to harass the rear of the victors, they also left one thing that even made the Japanese army heartbroken: that was paper money. The Japanese hoped to incorporate the occupied areas into the "Yen Bloc," force the Chinese people to cooperate with the Japanese, develop economic resources to the extreme, and obtain new industrial and financial strength from military occupation. All these plans were reduced to nothing because China's legal tender was just a piece of paper.</p>
<p>China's currency resistance to the deeply rooted attempts by the Japanese in the occupied areas has had such a great effect, and this is not a lucky success. After two years of perfect control in peacetime, the new legal tender gained the trust of the people, and the government was able to carry out active policies based on this trust, even in areas under Japanese control. The main purpose of this policy was to maintain the inherent price of Chinese legal tender, which was higher than the yen, or any new currency that the Japanese forced to use in the occupied areas with the tips of their bayonets and which depended on the yen. This means that legal tender can still be freely exchanged for foreign currency, while holders of yen or yen-affiliated currencies cannot enjoy this important convenience. In order to maintain this solid principle, China had to sacrifice a large part of the foreign exchange reserves obtained from selling nationalized silver abroad. Even at this time, legal tender could still be exchanged for foreign exchange. These reserves flowed out continuously (mostly due to short-selling speculation), causing the value of legal tender to gradually decrease to half of its original value during the year and a half of costly war. However, although the value of legal tender fell, it also dragged down the value of "Yen Bloc" currencies within China to the same extent. The general public still prefers to use Chinese legal tender. Its strong credit, widespread circulation, and solid foundation are exactly the same as before the devaluation.</p>
<p>At the end of 1938, the Sino-Japanese currency war was at a stalemate. China, with its shrewd and firm policies, had been able to reduce the outflow of its greatly reduced foreign exchange reserves, with the outflow in some months almost zero. Although Guangzhou and Wuhan had fallen, and China had not received foreign financial assistance, China was still able to balance its income and foreign exchange obligations. Therefore, China can continue to maintain a stable legal tender almost indefinitely, and at the same time can overturn the "Yen Bloc's" grand plan - at least this situation will not change until Japan has developed an effective new offensive. Japan, on the other hand, can only move step by step and remain on the defensive; this is certainly not because her old ambitions lack any enthusiasm, but because she has encountered major difficulties that she has not yet overcome.</p>
<p>The Yen's Sword and Background</p>
<p>At the same time, the "Yen Bloc," which originally included Japan, Korea, Taiwan, "Manchukuo," and the Kwantung Leased Territory, has been expanded in a nominally effective way to North China; and in an even more nominally effective state to the Japanese-occupied areas of Central China; as for the expansion of the group to South China, that is extremely weak. The Japanese side has never announced the actual procedures or actual conditions of this move, but analyzing this matter, it can be seen that its two major purposes and its current development status are: (1) To facilitate the expansion of Japanese exports to military-occupied areas; (2) To allow Japan to freely import goods from these areas without any expenditure of foreign exchange; this move can also allow Japan to sell surplus products in these areas overseas, and all the foreign exchange obtained will be used exclusively by her, regardless of the damage caused to the local area. The reason why the Japanese want to implement full currency control in these areas is not only to achieve these two purposes, but also to use this as a powerful lever to promote Japan's general economic development, and the method of promotion will of course suit the wishes of the Japanese military and Japan's own economic needs.</p>
<p>Japan must continuously expand her export sales, which is due to the implementation of two conflicting policies within Japan: one is to restrict rather than increase the purchasing power of her own people; the other is to increase the production of domestic manufacturing industries to the extreme of its technical capabilities. The volume of Japan's export trade has indeed grown surprisingly recently. From 1931, when the "Manchurian Incident" occurred, to 1936, the year before the Sino-Japanese War broke out, it increased by a full hundred percent in these five years. The development of foreign trade, at least in part, was achieved by reducing selling prices and making great sacrifices to the country. If war preparations had not absorbed the increased output of Japanese industry, then the gap between Japanese domestic purchasing power and the quantity of goods manufactured by Japanese industry would not have been filled by increased export sales. Military and industrial war preparations also have the purpose of continuing to increase exports. If the current war against China cannot achieve the hoped-for results in seeking a solution within the expanded "Yen Bloc," the problem will be more difficult in the future. Judging from the following circumstances, Japan's chances of winning the export problem by seizing the Chinese market are indeed very slim, and it is even impossible to greatly alleviate the difficulties of the problem. However, this unfavorable situation has added to Japan's reasons for seeking to subordinate the Chinese economy (to the Yen Bloc), so that it can fully develop whatever trade opportunities it encounters in China to the fullest possible extent.

<h3 id="e40">Foreign Exchange Stabilization and the Black Market Exchange Rate <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Liu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Liu is a pen name of a certain economic expert, and is highly regarded for his familiarity with the financial market situation. This article is a powerful prediction of the future of the foreign exchange black market, and those concerned about this issue should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>I. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Black Market</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has been established in Hong Kong. The so-called stabilization fund is, of course, to stabilize the exchange rate of legal tender. But in reality, China already has two exchange rates: the official rate quoted by the Central Bank, and the private rate in the black market. So, in the future, which exchange rate will the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund implement stabilization on, the official rate or the private rate?</p>
<p>Based on the following reasons, we assume that the exchange rate to be stabilized in the future will be the private rate, not the official rate. Because:</p>
<p>First, the Central Bank's exchange rate has been extremely stable to this day, remaining unchanged from the original quotation, and there is no need for stabilization at all. Moreover, since the currency reform, the government has had special funds for the stabilization fund in London and New York. After the emergence of the black market, the Bank of China also stepped in to adjust (see Mr. Song Ziwen's remarks). Comparing the black market exchange rate at that time with the subsequent exchange rate, it can be seen that China's Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund has been profitable. In other words, even if China's foreign exchange fund has not increased after the war, it will certainly not suffer losses. In this way, there is naturally no need to replenish the foreign exchange fund, and this established fund will naturally be used to stabilize the black market.</p>
<p>Second, this is determined by the existence of the black market exchange rate. Because if the black market does not exist, then there is only one exchange rate, and naturally there is no need to ask which one to stabilize. Practically speaking, assuming that British and American banks are determined and willing to help China's national banks to eliminate the black market, it does not seem impossible. However, in the current market situation, since they can easily obtain goods worth one yuan in Chinese currency for eight pence, why would they want to be fools who exchange at the official rate of one shilling and two and a half pence?</p>
<p>Third, when the Foreign Exchange Fund was established, London issued a statement that it was beneficial to British commerce. And currently, almost all international trade is concentrated in the black market, so the so-called benefit naturally refers to the black market. Judging from the position of the committee banks: HSBC and Mercantile Bank are commercial banks. Although the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are both known as national bank systems alongside the Central Bank, they also occupy an important position among commercial banks. If it were to stabilize the official rate, there should be the Central Bank involved. Furthermore, judging from the location of the establishment, if it were China's foreign exchange agency, the central hub should be located in Chongqing, and Hong Kong should be an office. But this Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is clearly originating in London and focusing on Hong Kong, so its stabilization target must also be to stabilize the black market and facilitate Sino-British trade without doubt.</p>
<p>II. Nine Pence or Eight Pence?</p>
<p>Since the existence of the foreign exchange black market, the market price has generally been declining, from the initial one shilling and two and a half pence to around eight pence and a quarter recently. However, there is a special feature, that is, the market price has shown particular stability in the last three months. From the experience of observing the trend of stability: (1) When there is a large amount of release, Mercantile Bank and HSBC are often the absorbers; (2) When the position is very tight, Mercantile Bank and HSBC are often the suppliers; (3) After the market price rises above eight pence and a quarter, it will soon return to eight pence and a quarter; and when the market price falls below eight pence and a quarter, it will soon balance above eight pence and a quarter. From points (1) and (2), it is clear that HSBC and Mercantile Bank are actually undertaking the work of stabilizing the exchange market. From point (3), it is clear that the standard in the foreign exchange black market has stabilized above eight pence and a quarter.</p>
<p>After the news of the Foreign Exchange Fund came out, it was known that Mercantile Bank and HSBC were originally the responsible parties in the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. So, what will be the future black market balance standard?</p>
<p>(1) One theory is to raise it to nine pence, on the grounds that the exchange rate of eight and a half pence or eight pence and a quarter is too far from the legal official rate. It is rumored that Shanghai foreign merchants and import/export firms have requested to be given foreign exchange at nine pence. The level of eight pence and a quarter has been stable for several months. If it is suddenly lengthened, it will immediately give the financial market a contraction effect. Therefore, starting from the current rate, raising the exchange rate to nine pence is most likely.</p>
<p>(2) There is also a theory that the exchange market will not move and will always stabilize above the current price of eight pence and a quarter. The reason is that the current price has been stable for several months. The stimulus caused by the devaluation of the exchange rate has instead given Shanghai the benefit of raising prices, resulting in a special boom. If countries want to support trade, they must maintain this boom, which also means they must maintain the level of a low exchange rate.</p>
<p>(3) There is another theory that the foreign exchange black market will have no level of ups and downs in the future. The task of the Foreign Exchange Committee is indeed to stabilize the foreign exchange black market, but not to supply the foreign exchange black market. Therefore, the Foreign Exchange Committee may use a subsidy method for legitimate British traders in the future, so that British merchants can purchase foreign exchange at a market price of nine pence. As for other merchants, they will be ignored. At the same time, for the foreign exchange trading in the black market, the method of "absorbing as much as possible when the position is large, and releasing it to a certain limit when the position is small" will still be used to stabilize the exchange market.</p>
<p>The above three theories all have some reasons and some possibilities. The recent market situation still does not show what method the authorities will adopt. However, a few points can be decided in advance: First, it is generally impossible for the foreign exchange black market to shrink further. Second, the Foreign Exchange Fund Committee will directly participate in the foreign exchange black market. Perhaps using a certain standard, but not necessarily maintaining a certain standard.</p>
<p>III. The Future of the Black Market and the Official Rate</p>
<p>Some have long advocated lowering the official rate, in other words, abolishing the official rate and aligning with the black market. This proposal has not been realized and will not be realized. If it were realized, it would be harmful and not beneficial to China. If the official rate is abolished, it is tantamount to stating that the government has no sincerity in maintaining the original exchange rate. At the same time, the informal exchange rate in the black market, due to the abolition of the official rate, is implicitly given legal recognition. Therefore, it will definitely not be implemented in practice.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of the essence of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund, the value of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund maintaining the black market is very little. Because the foreign exchange black market arises from China's management of foreign exchange. If the black market can be allowed to ask for whatever it wants, then why manage foreign exchange during wartime?</p>
<p>But conversely, it is ultimately beneficial to China. The increase in the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund indicates that China's monetary base is becoming increasingly solid. At the same time, since the committee is handled by Chinese and British experts, it will certainly not be used by third countries.</p>
<p>Book Review</p>
<h3 id="e41">"Modern Monetary Thought and World Monetary Trends" <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Mr. Yao Qingsan, Published by the National Economic Research Institute</p>
<p>Our country has never had a sound monetary system, and if there is one, it should start with the implementation of the new monetary policy. Before that, due to the sharp rise and fall of foreign silver prices, which were unpredictable, our country's economy was greatly affected, and even Chinese people who had no interest in economic research paid attention to the issue of currency. However, I believe that it is extremely rare and regrettable to be able to answer all questions in monetary science based on China's economic reality with my limited knowledge.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the pending case that has lingered in our minds has come to an end. However, this most advanced modern management currency has greatly transformed the history of world monetary science. It is true that since the Sino-Japanese War, our country's foreign exchange has been able to stabilize for more than half a year. Although a black market has emerged since the control of foreign exchange, and even the Japanese are now implementing a ban on the use of legal tender in "North China," the credibility of the circulation of legal tender has remained unshaken. This mystery has made the Chinese people greatly interested in monetary science. Therefore, it is increasingly felt that it is necessary to explain monetary theory based on the actual situation of our country. However, there is still nothing that can meet this need.</p>
<p>Now I have obtained Yao's book "Modern Monetary Thought and World Monetary Trends." Although it is a general discussion of modern monetary thought and general monetary systems, it has partially studied monetary theory in depth based on China's actual situation. It has been discovered that many authoritative monetary theories of modern times are not in line with China's actual situation, or even contradictory to it. For example, Professor Cassel advocates the Purchasing Power Parity theory, believing that when prices rise and fall, the exchange rate must change accordingly to correlate. However, based on the actual changes in China's exchange rate and prices in the past ten years, Yao has discovered that the change in the exchange rate often occurs after the change in prices. Therefore, this theory has been revised to "China's Purchasing Power Parity is actually governed by the exchange rate, not the exchange rate governed by the Purchasing Power Parity." Another example is Professor Fisher's Quantity Theory of Money, which is also used by general interpreters of the relationship between money and prices, believing that even if the total amount of transactions does not change, when the amount of currency changes, prices will inevitably change accordingly. However, after the author studied the actual situation of currency and prices in our country in recent years, it was felt that there was a causal reversal. Moreover, it is believed that "the change in the amount of currency does not necessarily conform to the change in the price level; even if the change in the amount of currency runs counter to the change in the price level; it can also be made by the change in the velocity of circulation to make the total value of goods and services transactions (PT) and the total amount of payments for all transactions (M'V') tend to balance within the same period." The value of Purchasing Power Parity and the Quantity Theory of Money has long been doubted by the world. However, the author may have started the re-evaluation of academics based on China's actual situation.</p>
<p>However, the greatest contribution of this book lies in re-evaluating all modern monetary thoughts one by one based on the latest facts and statistics. It enables the protectors to gain a correct understanding in academic theory. This opens up a path for the Chinese people to study European and American academics. What is this path? That is, to make judgments based on the environment in which we are located.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Securities The Stock Market in a Week <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai stock market has been following the lead of the New York and London stock markets, and has been completely dominated by political news. At the beginning of last week, because the Italian Prime Minister's speech was still good, and the German-Polish agreement was concluded, it was believed that the European situation could be temporarily maintained. Therefore, investors and speculators acted together. By the weekend, due to the tense situation on the German-Polish border, Chamberlain suddenly roared, and the situation in Eastern Europe tended to worsen. New York securities followed suit and plummeted. Therefore, the public was again restrained and waited to see.</p>
<p>Several stocks still had new records last week, such as Jardine Matheson (36 yuan) and Jardine Matheson (20.50 yuan). The stock with the largest turnover was still Jardine Matheson, no less than 7 shares. The price at the beginning of the week continued the strong momentum of the previous Saturday, still opening at 20.50 yuan. Subsequently, due to the successive sales of profitable bulls, the price fell slightly by 2 or 3 angles. Then, due to the decline in yarn prices and the unfavorable international situation, it fell back into the 20 yuan level. On the weekend, it was as low as 19.20 yuan. Fortunately, someone absorbed it at a low price and returned to 19.50 yuan at the close.</p>
<p>The turnover of Shanghai Silver Company's stock was also strong last week, above 20,000 shares. The highest price was 6.20 yuan, and it fell to 5.90 yuan on Friday afternoon. There was no turnover on Saturday. The turnover of Jardine Matheson was more than 10,000 shares. The highest price was 36 yuan, the lowest was 34.25 yuan, and the weekend was 34.50 yuan. Trolley stock hovered around 40 yuan. The price of Ye Guang real estate has been as low as 9 yuan. At the weekend, the seller asked for 8.85 yuan, and there was no transaction. The Gonghexiang Wharf stock is quite favored by investors. After deducting 10 yuan in interest at the weekend, the buyer offered 195 yuan, and the seller asked for 200 yuan.</p>
<p>The turnover of various bonds last week reflected the abundance of funds in the city. Among them, the 5% bonds of the Electric Power Company had the most turnover, followed by Puyi Real Estate, and the Shanghai Municipal Bonds (Republic of China 21st Year) also had 3,400 yuan of turnover, with a price of 56.50 yuan. As for rubber stocks, except for English Zhaohua, Qiaolao Buddha, etc., which had a little embellishment, the rest were never asked about. In addition, the Longhai Road bonds were traded for 5,000 pounds, with a price of 18 yuan. The Sino-French US dollar bonds (no seal) were traded for 600 yuan, with a price of 63%. The turnover from March 24th to March 30th is listed below.</p>
<p>Last week, in the Chinese Securities Market, the Chinese stock market was firm. It was heard that Nanyang Tobacco is expected to pay interest soon. On Friday, 50 shares were traded, with a price of 6.50 yuan, an increase of half a yuan compared to before. On Saturday, it rose another angle to 5 points, and 400 shares were traded. The buyer of China Merchants Securities stock offered 28.50 yuan, which was also half a yuan higher than before, while the seller asked for 29 yuan, and no transaction was made. 200 shares of Yarn Exchange shares were traded on Monday, and the price was still 38 yuan. 70 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded on Thursday, and the price was 6.50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Grain Dumai Arrivals Are Relatively Strong, Market Prices Vary <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, various gangs came from the source, and a total of 12 cars were transported down the river, including Su Tong gang and Kunshan gang, etc., with more than 3,000 packages. However, the sales market was slack, and the hoarding households were also indifferent, and there were more arrivals, so the sellers' thoughts were not as firm as before. Those who were willing to sell made slight concessions, and those who were unwilling still had the intention of persisting, resulting in a mixed situation in the market. Thick and thin japonica rice and high-quality dumplings kept the original price, and there was not much fluctuation. However, the river goods have been repaired by a few points to a corner. Duyang tip and pointed goods are scarce, and still set, and the way to change the yuan is still stagnant, falling by one or two corners.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Sugar Market 10,000 Bags of Taikoo Sugar Traded in May <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market was tight the day before yesterday due to the recent lack of cargo for thick and white, and five yuan and one angle in September failed to trade. 10,000 bags of Taikoo sugar in May were traded at 9 yuan and 5 and a half angles in Hong Kong dollars, and then rose by one angle to 9 yuan and 6 and a half angles. However, the reply was not transferred, which shows a glimpse of the tight situation. The guild’s drawing board, 24 thick white transit goods suddenly rose by 3 angles, and 300 bags were traded at 17 yuan. The spot market outside the warehouse delivered at 24 yuan and 9 angles, the warehouse delivered at 25 yuan, and the Da Jin Qian mark at 25 yuan and 3 angles. The Taikoo A mark rose by one angle to 24 yuan and 7 and a half angles, and the Taikoo Chebai B mark rose by 5 points, with the West Warehouse at 24 yuan and 8 and a half angles, and the East Warehouse at 24 yuan and 7 angles. OW mark six angles, CX mark five angles, DY mark three angles, HX mark two and a half angles, and the national sugar Shantou cotton white also appeared to be tight, rising by two or three angles, opening at 23 yuan, 5 and 6 angles, and trading 300 outer packages. The Shimen Slices Qing has not changed much, with more than 100 packages traded at 11 yuan and 3 angles.</p>

<p>Tong'an sun-dried dried longan has been slow to arrive since the red plate was opened. After checking, the Shenguang wheel entered the port from Quanzhou the day before yesterday, and 45 pieces were transferred, all of which were small boxes, with a total weight of less than 40 dans. According to the letter from the guest party, the cost is higher than before, so the market is gradually becoming tight, and there may be a slight increase.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Piece Goods Spring Woolens Are Selling Well <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Light gray and light-colored woolens are now selling well due to the approach of Qingming Festival this spring. Yesterday, fabrics such as Palikas yarn wool, Wanli Ding flannel, and light-colored spring thin flower woolens were selling well. Among them, woolen cloth with Western characters on the selvage (transliterated as Shimeitaikesi) is very popular, because both pullover and spring coat styles are popular. Deep and light colors, and stripes, checks, and solids are all available. It is said that wide stripes are fashionable and sell well. The first batch has been sold out, and the next batch needs to be imported in a week. The wholesale price is 12 yuan and 5 angles in national currency per yard.</p>
<p>Zhi Nail and Sub Nail Are Becoming More Lively</p>
<p>In the hardware trade, both the customer gang factory and the family came to purchase yesterday, and the turnover of various hardware goods still reached 3,000 to 4,000 dans. The market situation has little change, but the situation of Zhi nail and Yuan nail was unusually lively the day before yesterday. The individual situation is described separately below.</p>
<p>The Customer Sales of Zhi Nails Are Unusually Developed Zhi nails (also known as sesame nails) sales were the most in the local shoe market more than ten years ago. Other factories also had some embellishments from time to time. The customer gang sales have rarely developed. Recently, the situation has changed completely. Gangs from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai have purchased them one after another. A total of 500 boxes were opened the day before yesterday, with a market price of 46 yuan and 5 angles per box for three points, 43 yuan and 5 angles for four points, 42 yuan and 5 angles for five points, and 41 yuan and 5 angles for six points. Because the factory's shipment is not much, people's hearts are very good, so each plate is one yuan better than before. However, the business in this street has been unusually rare recently. Except for a few purchases in the market, there is no large-scale transaction. The Road to Sub Nails Is the Largest Sub Nail Business The local factory and the Small Hardware Gang are very happy to buy Sub Nail, and the factory's shipments are not much. There is often a shortage of goods in the market, so the price is very strong. Four points are sold for 36 yuan per barrel, five points for 31 yuan, and six points for 26 yuan. Fifty or sixty barrels were opened the day before yesterday, all opened by hardware shops in the North Suzhou Road area. The Tianjin Gang handled the customer road transaction for only ten or so barrels, and other gangs rarely touched it. As for the market situation, according to the people in the industry, because the factory's shipments are very few, they are often not enough to meet the buyers' needs, so it is not easy to relax the price in the later market.</p>
<p>Thin Iron Prices Fall Sharply</p>
<p>The thin iron market was previously rare due to the arrival of goods, and there was little inventory, which led to a soaring market standard. The highest price was sold at 135 yuan per box. Recently, because of the arrival of wild chicken goods, the quoted price of the regular goods was dragged down. Recently, each box is only sold for 115 yuan, but the transaction is still rare. Only ten or so boxes were traded yesterday, and they were handled by Xiangyan factories. Other biscuit companies, toy factories, etc. only asked. As for the wild chicken goods market, it has been very lively recently, and the quoted price is only 78 yuan per box. Can factories, cigarette factories, and toy factories all have some embellishments. It was found that 50 or 60 boxes were traded yesterday, all opened by hardware shops in the North Suzhou Road area.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Wen and Yong are Ordered to Find Ways to Disperse Accumulated Goods Wen and Yong Chambers of Commerce Invite All Industries to Discuss and Decide on Measures That Have Been Implemented <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Since the tense situation in Eastern Zhejiang, the coastal and river areas have been closely guarded. The Oujiang River in Wen and the Yongjiang River in Yong will be completely blocked when necessary. Now the two places have been ordered to disperse accumulated goods, and the local chambers of commerce have invited all industries to discuss and disperse them. The details are as follows</p>
<p>Find Ways to Disperse Accumulated Goods in Both Places</p>
<p>Wenzhou and Ningbo had a large backlog of local goods such as cotton, casings, silk cocoons, egg products, tea, tung oil, and cloth in the two ports due to the customs prohibition of goods being shipped to Shanghai. Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced the examination and approval measures for prohibited goods shipped to Shanghai, the obstructed local goods have been guaranteed by chambers of commerce and other guarantees, and released after verification. Now the two places have been ordered to find ways to disperse accumulated goods. After the two local chambers of commerce invited all industries to discuss, they decided (1) to try to ship out the blocked local goods as much as possible, (2) to move the imported goods that have arrived in Wenzhou and Yongbo to the rear in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Send Ships to Load and Transport Local Goods</p>
<p>The foreign ships that have been approved to sail to the Wenzhou and Ningbo ports in Eastern Zhejiang, such as British Taikoo, Italian Sino-Italian, Portuguese Meili, Zhengde, American China-America, German Lihe, Lulin, etc., have sent ships to sail the Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Yongbo, and Hong Kong-Yongbo, and Hong Kong-Wenzhou routes to undertake the export of local goods from Wenzhou and Yongbo. Therefore, many local goods have arrived in Shanghai and Hong Kong in recent days. The accumulated goods in Wenzhou and Yongbo have gradually decreased. As for imported goods, the through trains to southwestern China from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi have been suspended, and the goods to the southwest have been rerouted to Haiphong. Therefore, the outgoing goods of various foreign merchant ships have been drastically reduced.</p>

<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported that, according to Japanese sources, Italian Ambassador Ma Qiu recently arrived in Tianjin from Qinhuangdao and will stay in the port for two days. Afterwards, he will go to Beiping for a long-term residence. However, the cruiser he is on will go to Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e51">After the Source Is Smooth, the Market Rice Price Is Stable The Total Stock of Rice in the Two Concessions Is 650,000 Bags The Entire People's Food Will Not Be Deficient for the Time Being <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The people's food in the Shanghai Concession has been stabilized after the rice industry groups organized a rice price evaluation committee and made every effort to stabilize it. Now the source has been smoothed out and the inventory is sufficient. The market rice prices are all within the 14 yuan price limit, so the Shanghai people's food will not be deficient for the time being. The details are as follows</p>
<p>The Source Is Smooth The Rice Price Is Stable</p>
<p>After the Rice Price Evaluation Committee assessed the rice price at 14 yuan, the Market Management Committee implemented the price limit, cracked down on hoarding, speculation, and manipulation, and at the same time advised vendors to take the overall situation into account and try their best to purchase and transport rice from the producing areas to Shanghai for relief. Now, because the domestic rice price has fallen back to 1 yuan per stone, although the rice transported to Shanghai by vendors has no high profits, it will not be depleted, so the rice transported to Shanghai by inland rivers, railways, and foreign ships has gradually increased, and the market rice price can be stabilized. The general hoarders are afraid of being found out and punished by the committee, and they sell them one after another.</p>
<p>The Stock of Rice Is 650,000 Bags</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Zhang Nianxuan, a member of the Rice Price Evaluation Committee, yesterday. According to the discussion, the committee has sent people to investigate the stock of rice in the Public Concession and the French Concession. It is estimated that the current stock of rice is about 650,000 bags. These packages of rice are divided into two types: 1 stone, 2 dou and 1 stone, 5 dou. The total is about 800,000 to 950,000 stones. Although the arrival in Shanghai has decreased slightly in recent days due to the rainy weather, it is expected to increase after the weather clears. National rice from Suzhou, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Wuhu, and other places is being transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Rice Shop Door Sales Add a Commission</p>
<p>Member rice shops of the Rice Industry Association, in accordance with the association's resolution, have added a commission of 4 corners per stone for miscellaneous expenses for the price of rice sold at the door from April 1. Because each rice shop maintained the price limit in the past, no commission was added, resulting in losses. The commission and miscellaneous expenses are added to maintain the blood capital, and have no impact on the price limit. Therefore, the wholesale market price of first-class white rice is 14 yuan per dan, while the rice shop door sales are 14 yuan and 4 corners per stone. However, the association believes that the door sales market price cannot be considered to exceed the price limit.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Eastern Zhejiang Has a Warm Anti-Japanese Sentiment Strong Men Voluntarily Join the Army Wenling Strong Men Correctly Unite Comrades to Join the Army Local Institutions Greet Each Other Extravagantly <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the conscription system in various parts of Eastern Zhejiang, strong men have been very enthusiastic about enlisting in the army. Wenling, Zhejiang Province, is located on the coast and has a closed atmosphere. In the past, ordinary strong men were afraid of conscription. Now, after the government's efforts to publicize, not only the conscripted strong men are happy to be soldiers, but also inspire many young strong men to take serving in the army to kill the enemy as a national responsibility. Li Yanding and other strong men from Henghe Township in the county specially united 40 comrades to go to the county to enlist. After learning about it, the county government immediately notified various institutions, groups, and schools to go to the outside of Sanxing Bridge to warmly welcome them, treat them favorably, hold a welcome meeting, and perform anti-Japanese dramas. When they set off to enter the camp, all sectors of society warmly welcomed them again. It is now heard that the 40 strong men have entered the camp to kill the enemy. It is heard that last year on the July 7th anniversary, all sectors of Wen held a torch parade, gathering up to more than 100,000 people. At present, Wenzhou is carrying out anti-war work very smoothly, and its will is particularly firm. The people of Dinghai, Haimen and other places are also very enthusiastic about the anti-war sentiment.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in order to strengthen transportation institutions, adjust water and land transportation, meet the demands of wartime transportation, and promote the sale of specialty products from the inland to promote new economic development, has specifically formulated the Zhejiang Province Wartime Water and Land Transportation Tool Control Measures Guidelines. It has been passed and implemented in meetings. Hereafter, all water and land transportation tools within the province, regardless of whether they are publicly or privately owned, mechanical or manual, and all tool owners and operators, must abide by these guidelines. The Transportation Department directly under the government will manage them separately according to the nature of the tools through the Ship Brigade, Automobile Brigade, and Handcart Brigade.</p>

<p>Jinshan County is located on the coast and is a vital waterway for entering and exiting Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Since the fall of Greater Shanghai, Jinshan has also fallen into enemy hands. In order to promote local armed forces and integrate them with the party, government, and military, the National Government appointed Xu XX as the county magistrate of Jinshan County and concurrently the head of the Self-Defense Corps, and Lu XX as the secretary-general of the county party headquarters. After receiving the order, Xu went to Jinshan three months ago to take office, entered the Japanese army's rear, and led the people to engage in anti-Japanese sabotage work. Over the past few months, the anti-Japanese self-defense corps organized by Xu leading the local people has been established and has repeatedly defeated the Japanese army, recovering more than a dozen towns. A few days ago, Xu personally led the self-defense corps from XX to attack the Japanese army entrenched in Zhujing. The battle between the two sides was fierce. Although the Japanese army held its fierce artillery fire and desperately resisted, the self-defense corps warriors still bravely charged and fought, and their momentum was unstoppable. Until they engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the Japanese army was unable to withstand it and was defeated. Xu then led his team to follow and pursue, and no Japanese soldier survived. In this battle, more than sixty Japanese soldiers were annihilated, more than twenty rifles, three machine guns, and several boxes of grenades were seized. The town was then recovered by the self-defense corps. It is reported that the Japanese side has mobilized the navy in an attempt to "counterattack." Under the leadership of Xu, the self-defense corps has made considerable arrangements.</p>
<p>Contents of Japanese Army Bunkers on Two Routes</p>
<p>The Japanese army on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes has been forcibly conscripting civilians in the countryside for days, and searching for wood, bricks, and stones to build bunkers at various stations along the lines to prevent guerrilla attacks. These bunkers are shaped like bell towers, about three feet high, with observation decks and machine gun positions, as well as speaking tubes for communicating with the lower-level Japanese army. Four towers are built at each large station, and two at each small station, totaling more than two hundred towers. Currently, the bunkers at the two major stations in Nanjing and Hangzhou have been completed, and the rest of the stations are currently being built. It is said that each bunker costs 10,000 Japanese yen to build.</p>
<p>The Puppet Regime Plans to Establish a "Anti-Communist Corps"</p>
<p>The Nanjing puppet "Reformed Government" has recently been actively planning to form an "Anti-Communist Youth Corps," using students from the Jiangwan "Reformed Academy" as basic cadres, and recruiting another 1,000 young people between the ages of sixteen and thirty-two as members, providing them with three months of training, and then assigning them to various places in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to be responsible for investigating "terrorist" elements. The estimated start-up cost is about 1.5 million, and the position of the future head of the corps may be held by Ren Yuandao, the puppet "Pacification Department" minister, and key Japanese personnel will be invited to serve as consultants. This conspiracy plan is in progress.</p>

<p>Sir Sassoon, the richest Jewish man in this port, came to Shanghai from Washington last month regarding the issue of the Jewish refugees. Due to business needs, he recently stayed in Hong Kong for a short period of time. It is now known that Sir Sassoon has completed his affairs in Hong Kong and returned to Shanghai on the Empress of Asia on the first of this month. Dr. Peggy, who has traveled around the world, and many other well-known foreign businessmen in this port also came to Shanghai on the President Coolidge on the first of this month.</p>

<p>According to foreign sources, since the Japanese launched the war of aggression against China, due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army on all fronts, the casualties have been unexpectedly heavy. Therefore, the Japanese soldiers who are constantly being sent to China are only being transported back to their country as piles of ashes. The shortage of domestic soldiers has reached the point where no more can be drawn. The situation is extremely miserable. Since the focus of the war shifted to Central China, the Japanese army's casualties have become even more severe. All wounded soldiers are mostly transported by Japanese warships from the Yangtze River to Shanghai for treatment. The Japanese wounded soldier hospitals originally set up in the Hongkou district were already full. Recently, as Japanese wounded soldiers from Central China continue to be transported to Shanghai, the Gongda Yarn Factory, which stores military materials, has also been temporarily converted into a wounded soldier hospital. It is reported that most of the newly arrived wounded soldiers are young people who have not yet reached the age of service and cannot withstand the hardships of the battlefield. Therefore, anti-war sentiments are extremely prevalent. When in the hospital, they often cry out of homesickness, which shows the collapse of the Japanese warlords.</p>

<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that although direct trains from Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Hunan-Guangxi have been suspended, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Hunan-Guangxi lines are still operating as usual. However, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line ends at Guixi. Regarding the highways in Zhejiang Province, except for those along the coast and rivers related to military affairs, which have been dismantled, the remaining roads are operating as usual. There is definitely one or two passenger trains on each route every day. All parts of eastern Zhejiang are peaceful and the defenses are very solid. Outside rumors are not credible.</p>

<p>After the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers were ordered by the Ministry of Finance to collect and exchange old and damaged banknotes as much as possible, it has been stipulated that the legal tender of each bank will be exchanged by each bank as much as possible. As for the Zhejiang Xingye, Agricultural and Commercial, Agricultural and Industrial, Sining, Tongshang, and Zhejiang Bao banks, the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers are designated to collect and exchange them on their behalf. In places where the four banks of China, Communications, Jiaotong, and Farmers are not located, the post office was responsible for exchanging them before the war, and the four banks had signed a contract with the post office.

<p>After the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance managed the country's foreign trade, it exerted itself to restrict imports and promote exports, reduce the import surplus, and, apart from customs in occupied areas where its authority does not extend, tried to eliminate import surpluses at various customs stations to replenish foreign exchange reserves and complete the cause of resistance and construction. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Overall Import Surplus is Gradually Decreasing</p>
<p>The country's foreign trade has always been in surplus. For example, in 1932, the import surplus was 86,719,100 yuan. The government then tried its best to eliminate it, so it gradually decreased. In 1933, it was 73,373,900 yuan, in 1934, it was 49,445,100 yuan, in 1935, it was 34,340,200 yuan, in 1936, it was 23,580,300 yuan, in 1937, it was 11,513,000 yuan, and in 1938, it was 12,355,800 yuan. However, after the war, in September, October, November, and December of 1937, there were all trade surpluses. Since October of 1938, it has turned into an import surplus again.</p>
<p>Tianjin and Shanghai's Power over Opium and Cigarette Matters is Insufficient</p>
<p>The customs station with the largest import surplus from January to February of this year was Tianjin, with 26,859,000 yuan. Shanghai was second, with 14,486,000 yuan. Jiaozhou was next, with 7,197,000 yuan. Yantai was 2,766,000 yuan. The customs station with the largest export surplus was Mengzi, with 2,342,000 yuan. Shantou was second, with 1,588,000 yuan. Beihai was next, with 789,000 yuan. Wenzhou was 738,000 yuan. The customs stations with import surpluses are all in occupied areas, and the customs stations with export surpluses are all in non-occupied areas, which proves that the government has made every effort to eliminate the import surplus after the war. However, it is impossible to eliminate it in the occupied areas because its authority does not extend there.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Dumped in Occupied Areas</p>
<p>After the war, a large amount of Japanese goods was imported and dumped in the occupied areas, so the occupied areas are full of Japanese goods. In 1938, the import of Japanese goods was valued at 20,986,400 yuan in national currency, ranking first among the imports from all countries to China. The ports of entry for these goods were Shanghai, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, Jiaozhou, etc. As for the customs stations in non-occupied areas, the import of Japanese goods has disappeared. Imported Japanese goods are mainly cotton cloth, piece goods, rayon, seafood, flour, liquor, sundries, etc. As for goods from Britain, the United States, and third countries, they cannot be sold to occupied areas due to Japanese obstruction.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Kidney Deficiency in Men: The Crisis of Infertility and Divorce <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, a graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Kidney deficiency is a suppressible disease. What's more, it can turn into a yin fistula due to improper treatment. Many kidney deficiency patients, because this disease makes it difficult to fulfill their conjugal dreams and have no hope of reproduction, often do not get the opportunity for rapid treatment. They desperately choose medicine and buy aphrodisiacs, which is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Secondly, there are many weak endocrine agents on the market, which waste money and do not help the disease. Therefore, although they grow older, they still have no children. This is truly the most painful thing!</p>
<p>We doctors are very careful in treating such people. The first thing we must do is investigate the cause of the disease, which is caused by masturbation, injury, or excessive indulgence. As a result, the youth gland is unable to rejuvenate, forming a decline phenomenon, causing the blood produced physiologically to be in a state of exhaustion and failure. On the one hand, it cannot stimulate the sexual organs to make them erect, and on the other hand, it cannot promote the function of metabolism, affecting brainpower and physical strength. In addition, because the sperm in the testicles is scarce and fragile, even if there is a wife with healthy fertility, she is still unable to have children. Therefore, I solemnly advise infertile couples that if they want to have children to enjoy family happiness, they should practice abstinence at ordinary times to avoid wasting sperm, which is the best policy.</p>
<p>However, although this method is effective in application, if the husband suffering from the above-mentioned symptoms cannot be treated and cured, it will naturally be in vain!</p>
<p>Recently, in my hospital, I have been using the so-called testicular endocrine therapy, which is to use high-quality testicular essence preparations to supplement people with insufficient sexual power and weak reproduction. As a result, very satisfactory results have been obtained, but it is necessary to take panticome "Buti Kang," a renewal preparation made from pure essence extracted from chimpanzee testicles, to have a truly effective effect and never disappoint the takers. I once cured a couple who had been married for a long time without children, and the process has considerable medical research value, so I will describe it as follows:</p>
<p>The patient was a man with impotence and neurasthenia. After reasonable treatment, he took "Buti Kang" for three months, and the above symptoms were completely cured, but it was still difficult to conceive. Then, his wife was diagnosed, and it was found that although her menstruation was normal, her health level was low, resulting in a very short ovulation period, so in fact, there was very little chance of contact with sperm. Therefore, she was instructed to take "Buti Kang" for women, and as a result, her health improved, and she eventually gave birth to a son. This proves that no matter what the disease is, it is necessary to make a precise diagnosis!</p>
<h3 id="e61">Progress in Treating the Lungs <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>There are many methods for treating lung disease, but there is no specific medicine that can cure it completely. Since ancient times, I don't know how many lung disease patients have been sacrificed under the saying that there is no specific medicine. It is very sad!</p>
<p>Recently, due to the development of science, medicine has made great strides, and the treatment of lung diseases has also made great progress. "Bufei Naier" is a medicine that was invented with the driving force of the imperial examination system. This agent has been tested by famous doctors in various countries and has proven to have the effect of short-term effectiveness for lung diseases in various stages. Because no matter what dangerous stage the lung disease has reached, taking "Bufei Naier" enables the patient to develop the ability to resist tuberculosis bacteria, and can gradually shrink the cavities in the lungs until they are as flat as usual. Therefore, this drug is promoted as the chief wine of internal medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis, which is indeed not an exaggeration.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Cured Case of Many Years of Spermatorrhea <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Diagnosis by Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>The patient Zhao Jinrong, 23 years old, is from Xiajiang, Jiangxi. When he was 16 years old, he committed masturbation. Later, after reading the section of "Jiang Xingge Reunites with the Pearl Shirt" in "Ancient and Modern Wonders," he couldn't help but masturbate more and more intensely in the quiet of the night. After that, spermatorrhea followed, and the bad habit of masturbation could not be stopped. For more than three years, not only was his face pale and his spirit weak, but he also had the appearance of dripping sperm when seeing women during the day. Last autumn, he was ordered by his parents to marry. Every time he had sexual intercourse, he suffered from premature ejaculation and back pain, and the illness became worse and worse. He asked for treatment. I instructed him to abstain from the habit of masturbation, strictly observe health preservation, and temporarily abstain from sexual intercourse. He received electrotherapy for 15 minutes every day and was given a special medicine for spermatorrhea, "Nairis Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop spermatorrhea. He was also ordered to buy and take the German testicular endocrine agent "Buti Kang" for men to cultivate and replenish his losses and treat premature ejaculation. Zhao followed my words and actions. Half a month later, spermatorrhea was completely gone. A month later, there was no premature ejaculation, and his spirit was restored, and his back pain was also cured. Zhao, in view of the remarkable efficacy of the drug "Buti Kang," took it for three consecutive months. Now his health has been restored, his face is rosy, and his weight has increased by nine pounds (his weight at the time of diagnosis was only 102 pounds).</p>

<h3 id="e63">Gonorrhea and Marital Happiness <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Gonorrhea and marital happiness have a great relationship, because everyone knows that gonorrhea is an extremely infectious disease. Therefore, if a married man is unfortunately infected with gonorrhea, it is best to sleep with his wife only after he is cured. Otherwise, if the wife is infected with this poison one day, it will be transmitted again and again, causing the wife's leucorrhea to drip, infiltrating the vagina, and causing abnormal stinging pain. On the one hand, it can also lead to infertility due to gonorrhea, causing a breakdown in the feelings between the two parties and doubling the pain. However, if it is not cured within a short period of time, it will be difficult for men to abstain from sex for a long time.</p>
<p>We don't need to condemn venereal disease patients with the words "morality." We are doctors, doctors who solve people's pain, and we should talk about some effective and practical treatments, and we should also investigate the social causes of venereal diseases.</p>
<p>From the statistics of various medical scholars, we know that gonorrhea patients account for the largest number of venereal disease patients. It turns out that gonorrhea is extremely difficult to cure. If ordinary over-the-counter drugs are mistakenly taken, the disease and the medicine will not be opposite, and the result will not only be useless but also harmful. If gonorrhea patients corrode their joints as a result, they become paralyzed and disabled. Because gonococci do not only stay on the local urethral mucosa, they are scattered in the deep tissues and blood in the body, so the treatment must be thorough. If a man suffers from gonorrhea, the testicles are first damaged. If a woman suffers from gonorrhea, the ovaries are immediately destroyed. Therefore, the vas deferens of men and the fallopian tubes of women are both inflamed and blocked, and they can never conceive.</p>
<p>In order to quickly eradicate this tragedy of future unhappiness for both sexes, you can take the German gonorrhea special drug "Kelinong." Because this agent is made of a mixture of protein pigments, it can produce a great effect of using cells to resist gonorrhea bacteriophages after taking it, so it is most appreciated by general gonorrhea patients. For all new and old leucorrhea, the above-mentioned effects will occur within a few hours after taking "Kelinong." Completely sweep away gonococci from flowing blood and other places. Men use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally and women use "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories, so that it can be cured in three weeks in acute gonorrhea and five weeks in the chronic period, and the effect of root cure will be achieved. If married couples suffer from gonorrhea at the same time, they can be treated at the same time to avoid transmission and achieve perfect results. This is my practical experience over the years.</p>
<p>New Gonorrhea Terms</p>

<h3 id="e64">Gonorrhea with Ants Biting in the Penis <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Invasion of the Vas Deferens</p>
<p>The vas deferens holds great power over reproductive function. If there is no such organ, or if this organ is attacked by external bacteria, inflammation occurs in this lumen, and it swells and closes. Therefore, reproduction naturally falls into despair, and when gonorrhea patients develop vas deferens inflammation, there is always pain like an ant bite in the urethra, especially in the anus and perineum, where the swelling pain is like a split, urination is difficult, and after exerting effort, a small amount of urine is discharged, but there is also a lot of pus and blood mixed in. Lower abdominal pain also increases. At this time, if X-rays are used, it will definitely prove that the patient's vas deferens is swollen beyond constant. If you do not treat it promptly, you will of course lose its reproductive power.</p>
<p>Example of a Cured Case</p>
<p>Previously, there was a patient, Gong Xiaogong, 18 years old. Because he liked sports all his life, riding horses and wielding swords, he was known as a capable hand. After suffering from gonorrhea, in addition to having to take a little rest during the acute gonorrhea period, he resumed his old habits after the acute gonorrhea period. Gong's disease was caused by encountering an incompetent doctor during the acute gonorrhea period, and then being mistaken by inferior medicine, wasting more than a year, so he changed this disease. I used German static electricity therapy and X-rays alternately, and also used the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" as an internal medicine to concentrate its bactericidal effect on the lesions, so that within two weeks. The inflammation and swelling of the vas deferens has subsided, and after continuing the treatment for five weeks, this painful gonorrhea was completely cured! He married Ms. Wang Meiju last year, and their life is very harmonious.</p>

<p>Since Japanese warships disturbed the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, Japanese fishing boats, protected by Japanese warships, took the opportunity to invade fishing in the Zhoushan Islands, and arbitrarily burned fishing boats and massacred fishermen. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has approved the establishment of an aquatic product transportation and sales office to make every effort to relieve the livelihoods of fishermen. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang Fishermen Suffer Greatly</p>
<p>Hangzhou Bay, Ningbo Bay, Xiangshan Bay, Shipu Bay, Sanmen Bay, Taizhou Bay, Wenzhou Bay, and the Zhoushan Islands are the base of our country's fishing grounds. The fish produced are mainly large yellow croaker, small yellow croaker, cuttlefish, and hairtail, totaling 21,459 fishing boats. The annual catch is more than 97,230,000 yuan. The Shenjiamen area of the Zhoushan Islands is the gathering place for fishing boats. The fish caught are sold exclusively in Shanghai. After the war, Japanese warships were often found in the waters of eastern Zhejiang, arbitrarily burning fishing boats and massacring fishermen, so that the fishermen in the Zhoushan Islands did not dare to go out to sea to fish, and the fishing production was greatly affected as a result.</p>
<p>Japanese Fishing Boats Take the Opportunity to Invade Fishing</p>
<p>Japan has been deliberately infringing on our fishing rights for a long time. Japanese fishermen took advantage of the Japanese warships disturbing eastern Zhejiang, and with the Japanese government giving them various conveniences, they took the opportunity to invade fishing in the Zhoushan Islands. Today, in the waters off Changtu Island, Zhenzuimen, and Zhanggongmiao in Dinghai County, on the 25th of last month, a Japanese warship sailed from the southeast, followed by more than 40 Japanese fishing boats catching aquatic products, each flying a Japanese flag, and carried out fishing. By the 27th, they went to the Putuo waters to invade fishing. It is reported that since last month, Japanese fishing boats have been invading fishing in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang from time to time, and Japanese warships have been protecting them. These fishing boats are all of the latest type. The number of fish caught every day is quite large and they are all sold in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Establish a Transportation and Sales Office to Relieve Fishermen</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Wartime Product Adjustment Office approved the organization of the Ningbo Aquatic Product Transportation and Sales Office. The founding meeting was held at the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 am on the 28th of last month. At the same time, in order to divide the administrative powers of fisheries in various regions, the provincial government meeting approved that all fishery administrative matters in the future should be under the jurisdiction of the fishery administration offices in various regions. As for the functions of the fishermen's Baojia committees in various regions, they are to handle submitted resolutions and other matters to avoid difficulties in the promotion of work. In addition, funds are allocated to relieve unemployed fishermen and implement fishermen's land reclamation, etc., which have been implemented separately according to the original plan.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Weaving Industry Donation Payment Methods</p>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Industry and Weaving Industry Associations of this city held a joint meeting the other day to discuss promoting donations for refugees. It was stipulated that when businesses in both industries receive a certificate of origin for domestic goods, a refugee donation of one cent will be collected for each piece. Those who receive a certificate for zero pieces will be charged 5 cents for each piece of colored cloth and 3 cents for each piece of white cloth. The payment method is stipulated as follows: A. Those who receive a certificate of origin for domestic goods shall pay the attached refugee donation in full on the spot in addition to the handling fee, and the association will issue an official receipt (Shanghai Refugee Relief Association) to clear the procedures. B. Those who receive zero-piece certificates shall pay the refugee donation due according to the number of pieces listed in the general table, once every six months.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reported that the staff of the British American Methodist Church in Shanghai were quite shocked to hear the shocking news that Rev. Li was bombed to death by Japanese aircraft in Pingjiang on March 15. Yesterday (March 31), it was learned that the church has planned to inject Rev. Li's remains with medicine to prevent them from rotting. Although the general church has not yet received direct news from Pingjiang, Rev. Li's death has been confirmed by the responsible party and a protest has been lodged with the Japanese authorities by the British Foreign Office. Yesterday, it was learned from Shanghai that regarding the request for a rapid continuation of the bombing of church buildings, a request is currently being made to the Japanese side. The information received in Shanghai today fully confirms the previous news that church property was clearly marked with flags during the air raid. According to eyewitnesses of the attack, it seems that the Japanese aircraft deliberately bombed it. Li was standing in the place where the bomb landed.</p>
<p>Explosion</p>
<p>Li was bombed to death immediately. Another church worker, Clark, narrowly escaped death and fainted from the shock. It is impossible for Japanese pilots not to notice the flags, because the church buildings are magnificent and marked with huge British flags, and the ground is also painted with huge white letters.</p>

<p>According to the French-language "Peiping (Beijing) Political News," since the "Provisional Government" banned the use of legal tender (Chinese currency), the control over foreign exchange has become increasingly stringent. All export goods must sell the foreign currency earned from exports to the Yokohama Specie Bank at the "statutory" exchange rate. However, Japanese merchants can sell their foreign exchange earnings at high prices in the open markets of Tianjin and Shanghai. As a result, foreign groups in Peiping and Tianjin have engaged in negotiations with the Japanese, protesting the unfair commercial treatment of Japanese and foreign nationals and demanding improvements. The Japanese side responded by asserting that all foreign exchange earned by Japanese merchants from exporting Chinese products also passes through Japanese banks to be converted into Japanese yen, and that the exchange rate of Japanese yen is aligned with the counterfeit currency of the "United Reserve Bank," so the gains of Japanese merchants are equal to those of other foreign nationals. However, it is reported that foreign merchants in Peiping and Tianjin are dissatisfied with the Japanese response and are planning to jointly submit further protests to their governments against Japan.</p>
<p>Pseudo "Fresh Pork Market" Determined Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Seize Fresh Pork Business</p>
<p>Pork Industry Resolves to Not Participate</p>
<p>The pseudo "Fresh Pork Market" has been unable to establish due to opposition from pork merchants. Today, a certain Japanese firm is attempting to seize the fresh pork business by prohibiting foreign ships from loading at various ports in the Jiangbei production area, and buying and transporting fresh pork to Shanghai from Jiangbei. A few days ago, 600 head of fresh pork were shipped from Xingang (New Port), unloaded at the Yangshupu dock, and transported to markets in the Public and French Concessions for sale. The pork industry has already held a meeting to discuss countermeasures and decided to not participate in the pseudo "Fresh Pork Market." Therefore, no matter what, it will be difficult to realize.</p>
<p>Shanghai Refugee Shelter General Situation of Provisions</p>
<p>Total Number of People Exceeds 90,000</p>
<p>Savings Can Sustain for Three Months</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," there are now 55,000 Chinese refugees in the refugee camps of the Public and French Concessions. Another 40,000 refugees are being cared for by the Nanshi (South City) refugee area. Among these refugees, women account for 40%, and men and children each account for 30%. The monthly cost of provisions for refugees in the two concessions is 150,000 yuan, and the monthly cost of provisions for refugees in the Nanshi refugee area is 45,000 yuan. It is reported that the Nanshi refugee area can obtain about 45,000 yuan per month from charitable lottery tickets, which can be used for maintenance. Various refugee relief organizations in the city now have savings of 550,000 yuan, which can be used to maintain the refugee shelters for three months.</p>
<p>San Francisco Radio Station Broadcasting to the Far East</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reports that (yesterday, the 2nd) according to the US Commercial Counselor, the newly built radio station in Bao Island, San Francisco, with the call sign WCXBE, began regular broadcasts directly to the East on Tuesday. Its frequency is 9.530 (31.48 meters), broadcasting music, world news reports (Shanghai time from 8:30 PM to 10:00 PM), and other programs from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM Shanghai time.

<p>Mr. Esson M. Gale, Senior Financial Advisor to the American High Commissioner to the Philippines, stated to the American press while in the Philippines that "the key to world events can be found in the Far East." It is learned that Mr. Gale arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines on April 1 aboard the President Coolidge. Shortly after arriving in port, Mr. Gale visited the American Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Gauss. According to Mr. Gauss, he does not intend to stay in Shanghai for long and will soon visit the Shanghai war zone and tour major stores in the area. Before Mr. Gale came to Shanghai, he stated in a newspaper in San Francisco that "after the turbulent movements of the world stage, various things in the Far East, one part is calm, and another part is turning to high-speed changes." He also said, "The outbreak of events in the Far East is like the key to world events." Mr. Gale and his wife may leave Shanghai on the same ship after arriving in Shanghai.</p>

<p>March 4th of this year is the anniversary of the founding of the Congress of the United States of America. The United States Constitution was created in 1787, so since 1937, democratic countries around the world, such as France, Russia, Spain, and various American countries, have successively issued commemorative stamps to celebrate. Recently, reporters inquired at the post office and learned that our country's commemorative stamps for the 150th anniversary of the American Constitution, which had been ordered from the United States for a long time, arrived in late last month and are now scheduled to be issued from April 15th. It is heard that the design of the stamps is a portrait of President Sun and Washington, lined with the Chinese and American flags. The full set of stamps has four types, totaling five cents, twenty-five cents, fifty cents, and one yuan, with a total face value of one yuan and eighty cents. It is also heard that only 1.5 million sets will be issued, and Americans have already pre-ordered nearly hundreds of thousands of sets, so stamp collectors consider these stamps to be quite valuable.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Kong Xiangxi Encourages Research on Insect Control Methods, Aphids Are Most Damaging, Annual Loss of 100 Million Yuan, Commends Wu Zhenzhong for Research and Invention of Control Agents <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Aphids are a major pest in our country's agricultural products, causing the most severe damage to cotton, vegetables, fruit trees, tobacco, etc. It is estimated that the national losses are over 100 million yuan each year. The former Central Cotton Improvement Institute sent Wu Zhenzhong to research control methods. After hundreds of experiments and repeated research in the most severely affected areas, he successively invented inexpensive pest control agents, one called cottonseed oil emulsion and the other called cottonseed oil soap. The control methods were inexpensive and highly effective. Once promoted, farmers rushed to imitate them. At that time, within a period of one month, they were promoted in more than 140 villages, controlling 15,000 mu of cotton fields, increasing income by ten yuan per mu. The following year, the control of cotton fields was expanded to 620,000 mu, increasing income by 6 million yuan. If cotton, vegetables, fruit trees, tobacco, etc., throughout the country are universally controlled, the income can be increased by more than 100 million yuan. After the Anti-Japanese War, the agency was abolished, causing Wu's research work to fall short of success. It is learned that Premier Kong Xiangxi believes that this kind of research is beneficial to agriculture and that it is a pity to abandon it halfway. He has already summoned Wu to inquire about everything, which is very commendable. Wu has been specially assigned to work in the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee to continue researching aphid control methods to achieve complete success, contribute to the country, and benefit the people.</p>
<p>Tian Yao Qiao Opening the Dam Pros and Cons</p>
<p>Tang Puzhuang Writes to the French Municipal Council</p>
<p>Harmful to Drinking Water of Residents of Puhuitang</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council is dredging the Zhaojiabang River, which borders the Chinese and French areas, due to siltation, in order to facilitate water transport. However, it is heard that there is a plan to excavate the dam foundation of Tian Yao Qiao (Tian Yao Bridge). If this is true, the polluted water of the Zhaojiabang River will inevitably flow westward, and the health and drinking water of hundreds of thousands of residents on both sides of the Puhuitang River will be harmed, causing panic. Therefore, Mr. Tang Puzhuang, the former member of the Puhuitang dredging promotion committee, was appointed to write to the French authorities to stop it. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Sirs, Recently, your council has been working to dredge the Zhaojiabang River, which is silted up, to facilitate shipping. I greatly appreciate your concern for water conservancy. However, I have heard that there is a plan to excavate the dam foundation of Tian Yao Qiao, and I do not know if this is true. The construction of this dam is related to the rivers on both sides of Puhuitang River, such as Xiaozha, Hongqiao, west to Qibao Sijing, and diversion to Caohjing Laofenshan and other villages and towns for residents' sanitary water. If it is excavated, the sewage east of the dam will inevitably be discharged, and Puhuitang will be the final drainage point, harming the daily drinking water of hundreds of thousands of residents. The matter is of great importance. Therefore, when Puhuitang was dredged a few years ago, the local people fought to the death to build the dam to prevent the river water from being polluted (the committee built a pavilion and erected a monument on the west side of the Zhongshan Road Bridge, which can be verified). If your council excavates it, the disputes of the past will inevitably be repeated today. The appeal to dredge Puhuitang took more than ten years and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, which was not easy. Residents regard it as a source of life, and how can they easily destroy it and go against public opinion? I, Puzhuang, participated in the dredging of Puhuitang River in the past, and I cannot sit idly by and watch the previous achievements be abandoned. Even if the excavation plan is heard from hearsay and may not be true, in order to prevent problems before they occur, I have to write to your council to ask you to handle it carefully to benefit the people. I am most eager to pray for this. Sincerely, Tang Puzhuang, former member of the Puhuitang River Dredging Promotion Committee, to the French Municipal Council."</p>

Among them is a young man named Fan Shaochun, who is even more enamored with her, and dances with Chuan every night without fail. Chuan also sees that Fan is young and handsome and seems to be wealthy, so they gradually become close, and their feelings are not shallow. Unexpectedly, last night around 11:00 PM, after Fan Shaochun stepped into the Dahai Dance Hall, he suddenly changed his usual style and danced with other women. This made Chuan angry and upset, and she fainted in the dance floor. At that time, there was a performance in the hall, and people were surprised to see this. They called her but she was unconscious. So Fan Shaochun was also very anxious and quickly sent Chuan home, but seeing that her expression was different, he knew that she had taken poison, so he transferred her to Baolong Hospital. Dr. Luo examined her and ordered her to be hospitalized to observe whether the symptoms changed. The Xinzha police station received the news and sent a Chinese detective to investigate. As for the inside story, it is said that there are other things involved, and her mother's opposition to her dating Fan is also a reason. As for Fan Shaochun, he is well known in various dance halls, and people often call him Little Fan.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Dockyard Hoodlums Take Advantage to Extort Passengers, This Trend Has Become More Rampant Lately, Passengers Suffer Greatly <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Although Shanghai is currently an isolated island, the concession areas are still relatively safe on the surface. Therefore, people from the surrounding war zones and guerrilla zones in the interior are still flocking to this isolated island one after another, hoping to live in peace. As a result, the passengers arriving at the port on foreign and inland river steamers are very crowded. Originally, there was a kind of dockyard hoodlums who stayed there all day long, and when they saw passengers disembarking, they took the opportunity to extort them. The methods used varied from person to person and had no rules. Business travelers suffered greatly from these hoodlums. Lately, this kind of</p>
<p>Extortion Trend</p>
<p>has become more rampant. In addition to losing money, passengers' suitcases and bedding are often snatched away. A month ago, a Ms. Guo went to Haimen, Zhejiang Province, to visit her brother. When she returned, the suitcase filled with clothes she was carrying disappeared the moment she disembarked and hired a car, resulting in a loss of hundreds of gold. Although she searched repeatedly, there was no trace. At the end of last month, Ji Youshun from Zhenjiang also wanted to go to Wuhu on business. At the 6th Bund Pier, he encountered</p>
<p>These Hoodlums</p>
<p>In addition to being defrauded of a boat ticket to Wuhu, the luggage he was carrying was also taken away. After Ji's hometown was occupied, his family was scattered, and he drifted on the sea, working as a servant at Mao Jinji on Jing'an Temple Road. Recently, his brother in Wuhu visited him and sent a letter inviting him to reunite. Therefore, Ji bought a boat ticket on the 31st and took his luggage to the 6th pier to wait for the boat. Suddenly, a man named Shi Yunfeng saw that Ji looked like a villager and approached him, claiming to be from the same hometown as Ji and running a cigarette paper shop in Wuhu. He was also going to Wuhu to buy goods. Since they were from the same hometown and were going to the same place, they could</p>
<p>Travel Together</p>
<p>To avoid loneliness on the journey and take care of each other. Ji was a young man who had little experience of the world, so he was captured and regarded as a good companion. The man also learned that Ji had bought a boat ticket, so he first used the trick of defrauding the ticket, saying that Ji had spent too much on the ticket price. He had an acquaintance in the shipping company and could return the ticket and buy a half ticket. When he spoke, he asked a man in his forties to go with Ji to the shipping company on Hankou Road to return the ticket. Ji's belongings were placed on a cargo box on the pier, saying that these were all the goods he was transporting and he could take care of them. Later, Ji handed the boat ticket to the man who went with him and went to a certain</p>
<p>In Front of the Building</p>
<p>The man told Ji to wait outside the door while he went inside to return the ticket. Unexpectedly, from noon to evening, the man did not come out again. He had already defrauded the boat ticket and escaped through the side door. When Ji returned to the pier, all his luggage was also gone. While he was in a panic, he saw Shi Yunfeng wandering nearby. He argued with him and demanded his belongings, but Shi turned his eyes and pretended not to know him, and pointed out that Ji was a gangster and called his accomplices to beat Ji. The patrolling police arrived and took both Ji and Shi to the general patrol station and sent detectives to find out that Shi Yunfeng usually</p>
<p>Extorted at the Pier</p>
<p>So he was detained. However, all of Ji's luggage and boat ticket are still missing. On Saturday morning, the police escorted the suspect to the First Special District Local Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case and asked for severe punishment. Judge Dai interrogated them carefully and sentenced Shi Yunfeng to six months in prison. There are many similar behaviors like Shi's in the dockyards. If the victims can report them one by one like Ji, then these people can be restrained and cause less harm.</p>
<p>Possessing Opium and Smoking Paraphernalia</p>
<p>Woman Fined</p>
<p>Yisheng Rubber Factory was founded by Hong Liansheng from Ningbo, producing Arrow Drum brand galoshes. Yishengchang General Distribution Office was set up at 52 Xingsheng Street, French Concession. After the outbreak of the war, Hong's family also moved to the upper floor of the distribution office. Hong has an opium addiction and has smoking paraphernalia at home. Recently, the French police received a secret report that Hong was privately selling opium and selling it secretly. Therefore, the police sent Chinese and Western detectives to search the address a few days ago. Fifty packs of opium, one tael each, and a set of smoking paraphernalia were found in Hong's room. The opium pipe was made of rhinoceros bone and was quite expensive. Hong happened to be away at the time, so his wife, Hong Su, was taken to the police station along with the opium and smoking paraphernalia for investigation. Hong went around looking for people to rescue her, and the police took her statement that the opium was for her husband's own smoking and that he had bought it before, etc. The next day, she was sent to the Special First Court, where the lawyer of the French Concession Administration sued her for possessing opium and smoking paraphernalia. After Judge Qiu Huanying interrogated her in the Eighth Criminal Court, he announced the conclusion and sentenced Hong Su to a fine of 300 yuan and confiscated the opium and smoking paraphernalia. After the defendant was sentenced, she paid the fine and regained her freedom.</p>
<p>Refugees Ju Peiyuan and His Wife</p>
<p>Sued for Abduction Not Guilty</p>
<p>Injustice Can Be Exonerated</p>
<p>Ju Peiyuan, a native of Suzhou, and his wife, Xia, who used to live on Baoshan Road in Zhabei, took refuge in the Public Concession after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident and became beggars in the Xiamen Road area, sleeping in the alleys. Recently, they were suspected of abducting the eleven-year-old daughter, Xiudi, of Wu Changyao, a peddler from Ningbo who lived on Beishan West Road. The girl's father found out and reported it to the police, who took them to the Laozha Police Station along with the ten-year-old child, Ju Jiaqi, and transferred them to the Huisi Police Station and sent them to the First Special District Court. The two defendants stated that the boy, Ju Jiaqi, was born to Xia, and Ju Peiyuan used to be a bookkeeper at the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, which could be investigated. They were not abductors. It was ordered that Wu's daughter be returned to her father, and Ju's child was temporarily sent to the Labor Bureau Children's Education Center for care. The two defendants were detained. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial in court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the police sent detectives to the Commercial Press during the adjournment and found that Ju Peiyuan did work at the bookstore in 1923, but did not mention that he had a wife and children. He asked the court for a free opinion. Ju Peiyuan stated that the child, Jiaqi, was not born at that time, so he did not report it. Judge Huang carefully examined the child and found that the child's face looked like the mother and the eyes looked like the father. He also asked Ju's child if he wanted to go back with his parents or study at the Children's Education Center. The child said that he wanted to return with the two defendants, so Judge Huang ruled that Ju Peiyuan and Xia were not guilty and released them in court. Ju's child was taken back by his father.</p>

<p>Jing Jiaxun from Nanxun, aged 46, formerly worked at the Salt Affairs Bureau. He is currently unemployed and lives with his wife in apartment number 9, at number 121, Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. With nothing to do on weekdays, the elderly couple often frequented gambling dens in western Shanghai. However, they consistently lost. The night before last, they took two thousand yuan with them to a certain gambling den, making a final desperate bet, but unexpectedly lost everything. Overwhelmed with grief and anger, they decided to commit suicide after returning home, both consuming a certain poisonous liquid. The next morning, around 10 a.m., the servant employed in the apartment entered the room to clean and discovered Jing's wife groaning in bed, her expression drastically changed. Jing Jiaxun had already died. The servant immediately reported this to the accounting room, which in turn reported it to the police. Detectives were dispatched to the scene for investigation. Two empty bottles of poisonous liquid were found on the table, along with four suicide notes prepared in advance. Two of the notes were addressed to his nephew, and their content roughly stated that "someone from a certain quarter repeatedly urged him to take a false position, but even though he was in dire financial straits, he was determined not to sell his soul, preferring to commit suicide." Jing's wife was rushed to Renji Hospital by detectives for treatment, but due to the excessive amount of poison ingested, she died at approximately 10:15 p.m. last night. Her body, dressed in a purplish-brown silk cheongsam, with a shaven head and a full set of fake permed hair, red fingernails, and small bound feet, was immediately sent to the coroner's office to await examination by the court.</p>

<p>Zhu Xuexi, a 19-year-old youth from Changzhou residing at number 1, Xixiang Lane, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, was walking alone near the southern end of Gu'en Temple on Vermont Road, near the Wusong River intersection, at 6 p.m. on the 29th of last month. He saw Tang Caiming (age 31), a Chongming native, performing magic tricks and selling his skills near the foot of the foreign cemetery wall. He had hung a picture on the wall, specifically</p>
<p>teaching various magic trick</p>
<p>techniques. Zhu, driven by curiosity, approached to watch. Tang Caiming immediately engaged Zhu in conversation, saying, "I see that your complexion is ruddy and your fortune is about to bloom. If you want to make a fortune, I have a peach wood figure that can turn one into ten. If you give me one yuan in legal tender, it can be turned into ten yuan." Zhu was moved by this and immediately took out his wallet to check. He had a total of eight yuan and two jiao in legal tender, which he handed over to Tang to transform. After receiving the money, Tang put it into a red cloth bag he had prepared and, while</p>
<p>muttering incantations</p>
<p>, wrapped the bag and handed it to Zhu, instructing him to take it home and open it, at which point it would have turned into eighty-two yuan in legal tender. However, he instructed Zhu not to open or look into it midway. Zhu accepted the bag, carefully hid it on his person, and happily returned home. After taking out the red cloth bag and inspecting it, he found that the bag contained only folded old newspapers and no legal tender whatsoever.</p>
<p>Realizing he had been swindled</p>
<p>, he reported it to the French police station, who dispatched detectives to accompany him to the original location, where they apprehended Tang and brought him back to the police station. Under interrogation, he confessed that he also had a master and that he was only an apprentice, having been learning for only three days. The plaintiff came and asked to be taught a complete set of "spontaneous magic tricks," for which he charged one jiao. He denied having received eight yuan and two jiao with the promise to turn it into eighty-two yuan. The case was</p>
<p>transferred to the Special District Court No. 2</p>
<p>Criminal Division 8, where the lawyer Fei Xizhen from the French Concession Administration charged him with obtaining money by fraud and explained the details of the case. The defendant maintained his previous statement, but the plaintiff recounted the experience of being defrauded in vivid detail. Judge Jiang Liquan reviewed the statements and, considering the case required further investigation, adjourned the hearing for seven days. The defendant was detained.</p>

<p>Qiu Weiqing, a major paint merchant, profited greatly during the European War and built a Western-style house at the corner of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road in this city. Qiu's first wife did not bear any children, so they adopted a son named Changsheng, who is now in his thirties. Qiu felt that the adopted son was not his own flesh and blood, so he took the younger sister of Jia Yaochen from Yangzhou as a concubine. Jia gave birth to a daughter on May 17, 1921, named Shuying (who is not yet eighteen years old this year), and a son the following year, named Changyin (who is not yet seventeen years old this year). Qiu</p>
<p>died of illness</p>
<p>around 1925, leaving behind an estate of over five million, which was managed by his concubine Qiu Jia and others. In 1932, Jia also died of illness, leaving a will designating Chang Shuliu, the tutor she hired for the family, as the guardian of Qiu Shuying and Qiu Changyin. Their estate was jointly managed by Ren Jian'an, an old shop employee hired by Qiu Weiqing before his death, and Qiu Changsheng. Chang Shuliu passed away due to illness on November 27 of last year. Qiu Changyin and Qiu Shuying</p>
<p>are both underage.</p>
<p>Since Chang Shuliu's death, because there was no one in the order listed in Article 1094, Paragraph 1, Item 4 of the Civil Code to act as guardian, Jia Yaochen, uncle of Qiu Changyin, Zhu Henian, cousin, Zhou Shuqing, paternal cousin, Xi Qiu Lianzhu, paternal aunt, and Bian Zhu Hezheng, maternal aunt, held a family meeting on January 4 of this year. Zhu Henian, Bian Zhu Hezheng, Jia Yaochen and others decided to hire Hu Weiyun, younger brother of the late banking tycoon Hu Bijiang, to succeed as the guardian of Qiu Changyin and Qiu Shuying. Zhu Henian and others</p>
<p>based on the Civil Code</p>
<p>Article 1094, Paragraph 5 decision, and hired lawyer Zhang Danping as a consultant. When Hu Weiyun, hired as the guardian of Qiu Changyin and Qiu Shuying, went to the Qiu residence to exercise his guardianship, he was refused by Qian Jian'an, Qiu Changsheng, Chang Xiaosong (son of the late Chang Shuliu), and others. At the same time, Wang Jian'an's father applied to the First Special Court for the designation of Qiu Changsheng as the successor guardian, even though the</p>
<p>ruling was approved</p>
<p>, Zhu Henian and others have filed an appeal according to the law. Hu Weiyun recently hired lawyer Wu Qilun and others to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the First Special Court, accusing Ren Jian'an, Qiu Changsheng, Chang Xiaosong and others, requesting confirmation that he is the guardian of Qiu Changyin and Qiu Shuying. The court accepted the case. The court, based on the complaint, summoned Jia Yaochen and others as witnesses for questioning. After a brief hearing, the court deemed it necessary to investigate the case further and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Mass Weekly, No. 8, Special Children's Day Edition</p>
<p>— Chen Qin Title</p>
<h3 id="e78">Preface <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Heqin</p>
<p>April 4th is our Republic of China's Children's Day. The state's establishment of Children's Day has great significance, which we should deeply recognize and vigorously promote. We must ensure that the commemoration of Children's Day spreads throughout the country, so that all children across the nation can happily celebrate this festival, understand their responsibilities and missions in human history, strive diligently, transform the current society, and build a new country.</p>
<p>Today's children are the future masters of the country. As the ancients said, "The younger generation is to be regarded with respect," and as Western philosophers have also said, "The progress of national civilization follows in the footsteps of children." These statements all illustrate that children are the treasures of the country, the life of the nation, and the cornerstone of civilization. We have boundless hope for modern children.</p>
<p>When celebrating Children's Day, we must ensure that all children—both the fortunate and the unfortunate—receive happiness. As for so-called fortunate children, when we examine the happiness they receive, there may still be many areas where they are not happy. From a family perspective, the family environment should be as educational as possible, breaking the habit of children being pampered and cultivating in them the habits of autonomous learning, autonomous research, and participation in household chores such as cooking, washing clothes, and sweeping.</p>
<p>From a school perspective, dead book knowledge is not enough. Respected teachers should always consider the children's needs and supplement with more living materials. Stale teaching methods can be made more lively, avoiding the method of indoctrination and adopting methods of discussion and research, allowing children to breathe more freely.</p>
<p>When celebrating Children's Day, just discussing so-called fortunate children is not enough; teachers and parents should pay attention to and study the true happiness of children. As for the tens of thousands of unfortunate children, we must use all our strength to make them happy. We should encourage children to help children and mobilize adults to help children. To seek happiness for unfortunate children, more children's services should be established, such as promoting education for refugee children, establishing schools for newsboys, establishing orphanages for beggar children, organizing committees for the protection of child laborers, establishing apprentice schools, and establishing juvenile courts. These are all concrete efforts to seek happiness for unfortunate children. In addition to temporary celebratory activities, the preparatory committee also plans to undertake several permanent projects as a commemoration, hoping that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will come forward to support them. Then children will be happy, the country will prosper, and the nation will be glorious; truly, our future relies on it.</p>
<h3 id="e79">From Children's Day to the Importance of Refugee Children's Education <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jicheng</p>
<p>This is the eighth Children's Day celebration in our country.</p>
<p>The significance of Children's Day lies not only in stimulating children's interest and inspiring in them a love for the community, the country, and the family, but also in arousing society's attention to children's affairs. Children's affairs include peacetime measures such as children's health care, entertainment, prevention of abuse, education for special children, and the handling of homeless children. We must carefully plan and vigorously promote these. Now, with the country in peril and homes destroyed, and with refugee children congregating in the isolated island of Shanghai numbering over one hundred thousand, their education and care must still be comprehensively planned and decisively implemented. If they step outside the restricted zone, everywhere they go, everything they see, children as young as five feet tall are unable to attend school. If the war does not stop for a single day, these children will not be able to receive education for a single day. Year after year, in the blink of an eye, they will be past school age, and this throng of ignoramuses will become the backbone of society. It is lamentable to think of! As for children in remote and barren areas, they not only lose the opportunity to attend school, but also lack care. Their lives cannot be guaranteed, let alone education. Yet, children's affairs are nation-building affairs. To build a sound nation, we must have sound citizens; to have sound citizens, we must first cultivate sound children. Therefore, rescuing refugee children is more important than rescuing refugees, and educating refugee children is even more important than rescuing refugees. In Western countries, those engaged in education all devote themselves to the education of orphans and impoverished children. For example, in France, Mr. and Mrs. Beraud and their adopted daughter Louise Blanc established a rural nursery; in Switzerland, Pestalozzi established an orphanage; in England, Barto in Weiss established a nursery in Ballana, Scotland, to educate the children of local workers; in Germany, Froebel was hired by the Swiss government as the head of the Boulderford Orphanage; and in Italy, Montessori served as the supervisor of the poor children's school initiated by the Charity Group of Rome. All these are clearly visible to everyone. Among them, Pestalozzi, witnessing the devastation caused by military disasters in Starkey, with too many orphans wandering about, rented a temple to house more than eighty affected children and provide them with orphan education. Although he faced repeated difficulties due to the orphans' diseases, bad habits, inadequate school buildings, and external misunderstandings, he was able to move people with his pure love and spirit of sacrifice. In less than half a year, he achieved the greatest results. This can serve as an excellent model for us to carry out refugee children's education. In ancient times in our country, King Goujian of Yue spent ten years accumulating resources and ten years teaching his people. Fichte in Germany advocated revival, and Germany first started with cultivating excellent national seeds. The importance of refugee children's education can be deeply considered!</p>
<p>Shanghai's Eighth Children's Day Celebration – Meritorious Participation in Transformation</p>
<p>— Titled by Zhou Bangjun</p>
<h3 id="e80">A Respectful Message to the Fathers, Brothers, and Teachers of Children on Children's Day <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhiqian</p>
<p>As we celebrate the eighth Children's Day, looking around our country, the landscape has changed and the scenery is no longer the same. I cannot restrain my tears at the New Pavilion. Yet, the children in whom our nation's destiny and greatest hope are invested are spending their most valuable childhood holiday amid the continuous sound of gunfire. This is truly a most gratifying event. Even if I wanted to remain silent, how could I?</p>
<p>I believe that in these extraordinary times, what we expect of children is even more urgent than in ordinary times. The exhortations of fathers and brothers to their children, and the enlightenments of teachers to their students, should also be more important than in ordinary times. This is why I must offer a respectful message to the fathers, brothers, and teachers of children on this auspicious occasion.</p>
<p>What I want to tell the fathers and brothers of children is that family education should advance simultaneously with school education. Fathers and brothers should not think that they have fulfilled their responsibility by sending their children to school. They should teach them various etiquettes in the home, such as actions, advances and retreats, and manners of speech, and should provide concrete guidance on how to treat others, so as to cultivate their excellent character. The so-called "entering the home with filial piety and leaving with brotherly love" was originally the great path for ancient sages to teach people how to establish themselves, but today's children mostly regard it as stale and rotten words. There are few who follow it. This is what fathers and brothers should urgently clarify and guide.</p>
<p>What I want to tell the teachers of children is that children enter schools to seek knowledge and wisdom. In addition to imparting knowledge from textbooks, teachers should also observe the general situation and examine the national conditions, so that children fully understand the country's position and the international situation, in order to inspire their patriotism. They must also strengthen their physique and cultivate a martial spirit, so that they can be used to defend the country in the future. This is the responsibility that teachers should have.</p>
<p>Next, I want to tell the children themselves. It is no accident that you were born in this great era. During your years of study, you should first focus on your studies to enrich your knowledge, and second, focus on your physical condition to achieve physical health. After you complete your studies in the future, you can take on the country's affairs and make our country proud. You must know that the humiliation and great shame that our country has suffered for decades are waiting for you to wash away. The mission you bear is great, and you must work hard to encourage yourselves, so as not to fail to live in this great era.</p>
<p>I am happy to celebrate this auspicious festival, and I have nothing to wish for except to list three points to encourage each other. If you think it is a cliché, then how dare I?</p>
<h3 id="e81">Children's Toys and Children's Education <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Mingjiu</p>
<p>Children are the foundation of a nation. If we want the nation to be excellent, strong, and prosperous, we must first cultivate excellent and healthy children.</p>
<p>Child-centered education has only been advocated in China in recent years, and children have only begun to be noticed by people. Therefore, in education, the principle of implementation is to adapt to children's interests and needs. In terms of bookstores, children's libraries and young children's libraries are published. In terms of newspapers, there are children's education news and children's pictorials. In terms of society, there are organizations such as the Child Welfare Association, the Shanghai Children's Care Association, and the China Children's Products Company. Children's Day and Children's Year are also stipulated to show solemn advocacy. For the sake of our nation's future and our children's happiness, this is truly something worth celebrating.</p>
<p>Anyone who studies children's education knows that children's nature is to love games, so education should also be implemented from children's games. And the tools used in games are children's toys. Therefore, children's toys indirectly become tools for the implementation of children's education. Not only is this the case in theory, but also in the expression of facts, it proves that toys occupy a large force in children's education.</p>
<p>Since children's toys are so important in children's education, how should we pay attention to children's toys? I believe that in a negative way, we must actively try our best to ban inferior children's toys, because the influence of inferior toys on children is greater than the influence of inferior books on children. The reason is that toys are easy to generate interest, so the impression given to children is more profound than the impression obtained from books. As for the methods of banning, we must work together from the three aspects of family, school, and society to achieve results.</p>
<p>(1) Family Aspect</p>
<p>Because children spend the longest time in the family, they naturally play more. If there is nothing to provide them with games, it will inevitably make the children dry and tasteless all day long, or make them restless everywhere. However, if they are not selective, they are easily exposed to bad habits when they encounter inferior toys. For example, some families often use gambling tools for children to play. The influence of this kind of gambling toys on children is extremely profound, and even if you want to correct it with the power of education in the future, it is difficult to have a greater effect. It should be absolutely forbidden to approach children.</p>
<p>(2) School Aspect</p>
<p>School is the second family of children. Children spend most of their time in school other than in the family. Of course, I believe that the children's toys equipped in each school will definitely not have anything bad, but some schools are often brought by children themselves because of the simple equipment or too many students and it is not easy to manage some bad toys to play in school, or find some toys themselves, for unconscious games. People who are responsible for children's education should pay special attention to this place.</p>
<p>(3) Social Aspect</p>
<p>In addition to family and school activities, children sometimes come into contact with the social environment. There are countless games or toys in society that are specially designed to attract children. Children are often agitated by curiosity and will naturally approach him. For example, games such as turning colorful cards and rolling dice on small street stalls not only target children for profit, but also give children all kinds of bad influences and develop all kinds of bad habits. This kind of toys and games should be effectively banned. The joint force depends on the educational administrative authorities.</p>
<p>In short, all game tools that consume money and time and have no benefit to children's physical and mental health should be banned, and at the same time, we must actively promote toys that can inspire national thought, are beneficial to social construction, and meet the physical and mental development of children. In order to establish a good and healthy foundation for the nation, the methods can also be promoted and implemented by the three aspects of family, school, and society. If you want to do your job well, you must first sharpen your tools. May those who care about children's education pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Overview of Shanghai Child Welfare Undertakings <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhengfan</p>
<p>(1) Shanghai Municipal Council Child Protection Section</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Child Protection Section was established in December 1938, and was managed by Ms. Fleanor M. Hinder; assistants were Mr. G.S. Hall and other social service personnel with rich experience in social investigation and handling of individual cases. The purpose of the establishment of the section is to provide appropriate and rapid protection for children and adolescents who are adopted by non-direct relatives and are abused and exploited. In addition to protecting general children, the section chief paid maximum attention to the issue of protecting maids. The Municipal Council Board of Directors passed two principles of protection: (1) The Bureau should, in accordance with the gradually developing concept in other places, not recognize the status of maids or any similar slave status. (This principle contains the meaning that maids should not be registered separately.) (2) The Bureau should also, as other places pay serious attention to, use all possible methods to ensure that the transfer of children and adolescents is reported to the Bureau's responsible personnel, and try to protect the transferees, so as to show the Bureau's sense of responsibility.</p>
<p>The Child Protection Section is related to all child welfare institutions in Shanghai and maintains close contact. For children issued by the court to various child welfare institutions, each child welfare institution should fill out a report every month and send it to the Child Protection Section for reference. Unless discussed with and agreed by the Child Protection Section, no child welfare institution may send court-issued children to factories, or allow people to adopt them, or choose a spouse for them, or dispose of them in other ways.</p>
<p>(2) Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association aims to promote national children's welfare; after the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, in order to facilitate relief work, the general association moved to Chongqing, and an office was set up in Shanghai (address: No. 208, Central China Building, Edward Road). The persons in charge of the office are Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Wu Weide, etc. All its affairs are divided into relief, protection, health, education, etc. In the 27th year of the Republic of China, the office rescued a total of 1,857 children; in addition to those who were placed, there were still 895 children left, who are still being continuously taken in. In addition, it also handled cases of child abuse, treated children's diseases, and held health competitions.</p>
<p>There are many child welfare institutions in Shanghai, and they lack opportunities for recognition and contact with each other. As far as the author knows, the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association has sent personnel to study the issue, hoping to find the most appropriate solution.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai Children's Welfare Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association was established on June 6, 27th year of the Republic of China. The directors are Chen Heqin, Chen Jicheng, and Huang Dinghui, etc., and the persons in charge are Wu Zhiqian, Zhao Yiwei, and Shao Mingjiu, etc. Its purpose: "Adopt the most economical, fastest, and most sustainable method to strive to protect children and cultivate healthy citizens of the Republic of China." All work is divided into five items: (1) Studying children's welfare undertakings, (2) Holding children's welfare undertakings, (3) Contacting or assisting children's welfare agencies and groups, (4) Cultivating children's welfare talents, (5) Editing children's welfare materials.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Children's Welfare Association has established 14 schools for newsboys, educating more than 600 newsboys. The newsboy schools plan to establish another 10 schools, so that all newsboys in the city can enjoy educational opportunities. In addition, it is also preparing to organize a committee for the protection of child laborers, to assist factories in improving the lives of child laborers, to promote child labor education, to establish orphanages for beggar children, to accommodate beggar children in the city, and to provide them with educational opportunities and production training.</p>

<h3 id="e89">China Has No "Anti-Foreign Movement" <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>At least for now, China has no anti-foreign movement, only a resistance movement against the enemy. For any foreign country that treats us as a friendly nation, we also treat it as a friendly nation, and we welcome it with open arms. There is absolutely no reason to exclude it. If it is a foreign country that intends to invade us, or is invading us, then we will certainly resist to the death, not only excluding it!</p>
<p>According to recent reports from mainland newspapers and general inland sources, many Chinese newspapers are actually expressing Chinese people's xenophobia, allowing anti-British sentiments, and there are also all kinds of slogans and leaflets, and the situation seems very enthusiastic. This kind of farce, not to mention discerning people, even three-foot-tall children, know its source, isn't it the ghost of our enemy? Once it's said, it's really not worth laughing at!</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that our friendly nations, including Britain, will not believe that China is anti-foreign. This is just our enemy, using the method of borrowing popular opinion, to put pressure on their puppets to play out a trick. And these puppets, who have already cut themselves off from their compatriots, do not count as Chinese people, let alone represent China.</p>
<p>At the same time, I hope that our compatriots in the guerrilla areas will clearly recognize the difference between friends and enemies. They will not be deceived by the enemy's small favors and treat the enemy as a friend, nor will they be influenced by the enemy's poisonous propaganda and treat a friend as an enemy. In short, those who help us are our friends, and those who invade us are our enemies. As for what is assistance and what is invasion, there are many facts before our eyes, which can be proven everywhere, so I don't need to explain it further.</p>
<p>Seeing this kind of enemy's trick will naturally make us know the enemy's intention. They want to drive out all foreigners in China, so that they can monopolize it to their heart's content, which is of course their due purpose. However, they avoid showing their faces and incite their puppets to come out and bark, claiming it as the "automatic" action of the Chinese people. This plan is indeed cunning and poisonous. Because they think that in this way, they can avoid responsibility, and our friendly nations may even be misunderstood and resent us, and will not come to help us. However, it is undeniable that this plan will certainly not be effective, and the degree of its meanness and shamelessness makes people unable to speak.</p>
<p>Therefore, we do not exclude foreigners; we only resist the enemy; we allow not to exclude foreigners who help us, and we want to resist the enemy who slanders us for excluding foreigners!</p>

<p>——Recollections of the Breakthrough from Xuzhou</p>
<p>When we retreated from Yuwang Mountain, the order was to defend Phoenix Mountain, Batou Mountain, and Suyang Mountain. Unexpectedly, after resting in Songzhuang for two days, another order arrived: Retreat to Yunlong Mountain!</p>
<p>Where is Yunlong Mountain? It is said to be in Xuzhou. At that time, the enemy had quietly infiltrated the Longhai Railway between Mengcheng and Yongcheng, blown up the Huangkou Iron Bridge, and was surrounding Xuzhou...</p>
<p>But we did not believe that Xuzhou would be lost. When we previously transferred from the Pinghan Railway to the Longhai Railway, passing through Xuzhou to Taierzhuang, we only casually glanced at Xuzhou and hurriedly parted ways. Now, upon hearing the order to retreat to Yunlong Mountain, we were all very happy! Because we could go to Xuzhou to have fun again. But at the same time, we felt a bit of sadness: all this land, all this wheat, was about to be trampled by the enemy's iron hooves!</p>
<p>With endless feelings of reluctance, one night, while the people of Songzhuang were sound asleep, we quietly left Songzhuang and set off for Xuzhou.</p>
<p>People walked urgently one after another. The cavalry rode comfortably on strong horses, half-running to get ahead. The heavy artillery, pulled by eight large mules, rolled slowly at the back of the队伍, with terrible yellow dust continuously entering people's nostrils and mouths, making people feel somewhat suffocated.</p>
<p>Trucks carrying military supplies, creaking from time to time, rushed up from behind. The strong lights made people afraid to turn around and look at them, so they had to stand by the roadside to let them pass, and then choked in the dust to catch up with the队伍 ahead.</p>
<p>The sky was dotted with countless bright stars, and the earth was so dark and沉沉的. The endless wheat field, gently swaying in the breeze, had been swallowed by the darkness. The trees appeared as dark shadows, standing like giants. The night wind, carrying a hint of coldness, blew towards people from time to time, making them feel a little cold!</p>
<p>In the villages near and far, the sound of horses' hooves often brought about bursts of dogs barking, and other than that, there was no sound at all. Everything was so quiet.</p>
<p>The endless队伍, like a black stream, silently surged across the vast northern plain, without stopping, as if they were all iron men and horses, never tired.</p>
<p>At dawn, to avoid enemy planes, we stopped to rest in a small village called Huangguang, with only four or five families, but the people had already fled. At dusk, the队伍 continued to advance along the highway covered with three or four inches of yellow dust.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang... Suddenly, a series of crisp gunshots came from the front, followed by increasingly dense fire. Amidst the chaotic gunshots, the sound of artillery also resounded loudly. Soon, a glowing fire rose in front, illuminating the sky so fiery red.</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>"Probably encountered the enemy!"</p>
<p>But it didn't seem like an encounter with the enemy at all. The队伍 continued to advance without any fear, and bullets whizzed past.</p>
<p>Boom! Suddenly, a red light like lightning flashed, followed by a startling explosion, illuminating the nearby villages shrouded in darkness so clearly. This made us exclaim in surprise and quickly duck our heads:</p>
<p>"What are they doing?"</p>
<p>No one knew. Everyone walked mechanically with a tense heart. But soon, news came from the front: This was a friendly army ordered to retreat, and they had automatically burned the military supplies they could not take away at the Daxujia Station on the Longhai Railway. Although this was unavoidable, and although it damaged the Longhai Railway, preventing the enemy forces advancing from Pixian from moving along the railway line, we all felt a kind of indescribable heartache when we thought that the bullets bought with the people's blood and sweat could not be fired into the enemy's chest!</p>
<p>Some cars that had broken down somewhere were abandoned on the roadside without anyone caring for them. Horses and oxen that had been dragged to death carrying military supplies lay on the highway covered in yellow dust, making people feel a sense of sadness: even horses and oxen have walked to death, how can our two feet withstand more than horses and oxen? But we are not horses and oxen after all, walk! walk! walk!</p>
<p>Walking non-stop, eyes that hadn't slept for one day and two nights felt as if something was pressing on the eyelids, and the eyelids kept wanting to close. The head was so昏沉沉的 and we were already in a state of half-sleep, but our minds were clear, and we were still vigilant.</p>
<p>When the east spat out a hazy dawn, we finally reached the camp - Tongcun.</p>
<h3 id="e91">A Traveler in the Desert <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Liu You</p>
<p>This is not a remote mountain area, nor is it the vast ocean, but a boundless expanse of land, a vast desert composed of countless sand dunes.</p>
<p>Thousands of miles, tens of thousands of miles, unable to see the path ahead, unable to see the end. What is seen is a cloudy sky, and a vast expanse of sand and soil, unable to see the lovely and pleasing green, unable to feel the vibrant life.</p>
<p>All year round, it is so silent, without a trace of human habitation, extremely desolate. This desert blocks people's way, like a towering mountain soaring into the clouds, impossible to walk past, impossible to jump over, impossible to fly over!</p>
<p>Crossing a big river, crossing a vast ocean, does not require much strength, but crossing this vast desert requires great perseverance!</p>
<p>In the desert, no one dares to venture deep; only the struggling heroes, and their faithful companions—camels, with a spirit of transcendence, pass through this desolate world!</p>
<p>No sunlight, no water, and no place to rest, only struggling forward, enduring hunger and thirst!</p>
<p>A whirlwind rolls up the sand, causing travelers to lose their way, but this does not give them the slightest fear. They pause for a moment, rally their spirits, and move forward again!</p>
<p>Vast expanse, after endless time, they still have not reached their destination, but they will not be discouraged, and they continue to proceed slowly. They know that one day, they will jump out of this death-like world and embark on the path of "success"!</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Blood Wine of Life <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Yibai</p>
<p>"Drink me with the blood wine of life, return to me freedom and light."</p>
<p>I want to jump, I want to shout, I want to cry, no; I'm going crazy.</p>
<p>Everything around is pitch black, unable to see the sky and the sun, without any light, not even a star.</p>
<p>People say that spring has already arrived, but I can't see it. Is it obscured by tall buildings? Has it been frightened away by artillery fire? Perhaps it has been buried under piles of rubble. Ah! Where is spring?</p>
<p>I love freedom, but some people won't let you be free. Do you want to hang a national flag? They will tell you to take it down. Do you love your country? Perhaps someone will interfere with you. Ah! You are not free, do you know?</p>
<p>Look at those ghost-like creatures, they laugh, they dance; they sell their souls, they sell everything.</p>
<p>Everything revolves around you, darkness assaults you, terror ambushes you, wealth and status entice you. Making you suffocate, making you angry, making you disgusted.</p>
<p>This is an isolated island! No freedom, no light, not allowed to move, only to be content to be a human being.</p>
<p>Give me the blood wine of life, because I am too depressed.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Food, Sex, and Shelter <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>These past few weeks, I’ve been busy sending airmail letters. The letters are written in a telegram-like style, barely filling a single page; but the items attached to the letters are impossible to reduce. The nights are long and fraught with dreams, so the postage adds up quite a bit. Since I’ve never flown in an airplane myself, the fact that these dispatched spiritual emissaries have the chance to “cleave the waves, journeying thirty thousand *li*” does give me a fresh feeling in my otherwise mundane life. I’m floating on air, among the stars, writing in the style of high antiquity. Even if the plane should crash, at least I’d have the satisfaction of literally causing “fallen petals to write on the water’s surface”!</p>
<p>Because of this, I’ve been thinking about life’s big questions. Here we go again! Life, one can’t have it both ways. When we’re in the throes of resistance, friends! Don’t let heterodox theories deflate you. Moreover, dispersing the population is also a way of “performing one’s duties in rank.” Personal bullets and group bullets are equally indifferent to the meaning of life, so what’s the point of being clever? Let’s talk about that after we’ve laid down our arms and promoted culture!</p>
<p>Then I remember that one still has to aim when shooting, and the point of aiming is none other than to “clearly identify the enemy.” Aiming without hitting the target just means the enemy will “laugh in your face.” Of course, I’m not the one to speak clearly on this matter, having never taken to the field of battle myself.</p>
<p>Let’s just say—the “let’s just say” is quite reasonable. Instead of digressing, let’s stick to the point that “resistance is above all else.” Simply embracing that one point is already enough. However, living in this place that is neither the front lines nor the rear, in a place that’s half “tin can town” and half “ivory tower,” even the “bright eyes and gleaming teeth” of cultured women who occasionally become seized by patriotic passion during this war of resistance can really be disheartening!</p>
<p>People are so busy, it’s practically impossible to find a free moment. As soon as one thing is finished, something else comes up. And after that’s finished, yet another thing keeps coming up, until the dark-haired grow old, and the steadfast are shaken off. And then there are those duties that are neither specifically assigned nor officially required—the non-duties that are eating, sex, and shelter—that keep butting in, making it so a person must strenuously carry out the business of food, sex, and shelter in addition to speaking of love (for one’s country) and resistance (against the enemy). It is the gentlemen of the isolated island and their partners of all kinds who excel most joyfully at this, in what some call “red-blooded happiness”! “One won’t give up until reaching the Yellow River, and once there, one wants to cross it.” That’s what makes the sea of desire so boundless, beyond all hope of rescue!</p>
<p>Food, sex, shelter: the deepest desires of mankind exist here! The ancients said that “food and sex are human nature.” Eating, making love, and sleeping: these are today’s equivalents, and one can’t get by without any of them.</p>
<p>Yu Dafu once said, “Behind vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while in the fields, there are corpses of the frozen. That’s why there must be class struggle. On one side, there are three thousand beauties in the emperor’s harem, and the king never tires of looking at them. On the other side, there is a wife’s separation from her husband in Stone Rampart Village, her husband garrisoned at Xiao Pass while she stays in Wu. That’s why there must be revolution.” And then he went on to explain:</p>
<p>“However, because the desires for food and sex are so basic, they are very easy to satisfy. No matter how great an epicure you are, you can be knocked out with just a flagon of wine, one chicken, three bowls of white rice, and a big flatbread. Once you’re full, even if someone invites you to a feast, you can’t eat another bite. As for sex, no matter how virile you are, you can only deal with at most ten women. After ten women, even if it were Xi Shi or Yang Guifei, they couldn’t arouse your desire.”</p>
<p>That seems to resolve part of life’s desires, so perhaps there’s no need to say any more.</p>
<p>However, “Once they’re full, do you expect them to love their country? After they’ve ‘lost all sexual desire,’ do you expect them to resist or step onto the front lines of national salvation?” No, no, that is a very lofty theory! Ever since Liang Qichao designed that “manure-making machine”; ever since Bian Que said that “when semen is generated, the body is strengthened”; ever since the doctrine of “environmental relations”; ever since the pretense of “rear-area duty”; ever since the decision “not to be a traitor for the time being”; and ever since the idea that “if you have something to say, you should say it to your own people first” was articulated so reasonably that it perfectly aligned with the supreme principle that the nation is above all else, only then did everyone quietly retreat and huddle together in eating, sex, and shelter, seeking pleasure in life.</p>
<p>Large advertisements, a throng of writhing pedestrians, towering architecture, window displays—all of this is striving to add a footnote to my text, locally providing evidence.</p>
<p>I don’t understand the psychology of various groups in society, so everything I say comes out wrong. But who can live without white rice, sex, and sleep?</p>
<p>It is precisely because one cannot live without them that some people stirred up political turmoil to make money off government bonds in the past, and now that the nation is in crisis, some are able to profit off the nation’s plight. As for embezzling relief grain, silencing those who speak out, and skimming some foreign exchange to stuff their own pockets, their great desires are so well-versed in the sixty-four hexagrams that they can make use of any of them.</p>
<p>Cao Juren once distinguished between traitors and puppets. The kind of people one sees before one’s eyes probably won’t all become traitors, but there seem to be elements that contain the possibility of becoming puppets.</p>
<p>When that time comes, then after eating, sex, and shelter, there will be a new excuse arising from the “pressure of the environment,” and then we, a group of friends who are rushing to be busy for nothing with our pens, will finally feel it was all in vain!</p>

<h3 id="e94">New Pharmaceutical Industry in Shanghai Sun Chucheng <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Medicines are for curing diseases, and there is essentially no such thing as old or new. What is currently called new medicine refers to national medicine that has been used for thousands of years without refinement. This term was established by Mr. Huang Chujiu of Yuyao, a pioneer in the field of new medicines. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, when the National Revolutionary Army settled in Southeast China, major pharmacies formed an industry association. Mr. Huang suggested that the various medicines sold in pharmacies recently included Chinese herbal ingredients and Eastern medicines, and the original term Western medicine seemed insufficient to fully encompass them. Moreover, the Ministry of the Interior had changed Western medicine to new medicine, so Western medicine should also be changed to new medicine. After discussion, everyone agreed and decided on the change. Since Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs in our country thousands of years ago, all medicines have been mostly herbs, trees, insects, and stones in terms of quality; in terms of manufacturing methods, they are nothing more than stir-frying, steaming, soaking, and temporary decoction. The quantity is large and the taste is bitter. It is inconvenient for patients with weak appetites to swallow them. This is not as effective as the extraction and refinement of Western medicines, which take the essence and remove the dregs. The quantity is small and the power is strong. They are beautiful and easy to take. This is why Western medicines can be imported and seize our rights and interests. Enlightened people, in view of the prosperity of science and the increasing belief in Western medicine among the people, if they do not find ways to remedy the situation, the outflow of rights and interests will have a significant impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, they have all shifted their focus and tried their best to imitate them, hoping to block the loopholes. This is also good news in the voice of advocating domestic products. Shanghai is a major trading port, and there are more pharmacies and pharmaceutical factories than in other provinces and cities. Moreover, the goods sold in pharmacies in the interior are mostly wholesale from Shanghai, so the new pharmaceutical industry in Shanghai leads the country. The Joint Association of New Pharmaceutical Industry Associations across the country is also located in Shanghai. The Ministry of Health also invited representatives from the association to participate in the regulations for managing drug dealers, in order to promote it. Currently, 108 companies have joined the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association. The names are divided into pharmacies, drug stores, and pharmaceutical factories, and the organization has sole proprietorship, partnership, and stockholding. The following 28 companies emphasize both retail and wholesale: Wuzhou, Sino-French, Sino-Western, Sino-British, Huamei, Huayang, Huaying, Nanyang, Jicheng, Taihe, Aihua, Xinhua, Baohua, Tianhua, Dalu, Dahua, Dasheng, Wanguo, Gongda, Zhengwei, Hongxing, Foci, Jicang, Yonghe, Jihuatang, Pacific, Lianchangde, and Weierkang. The following 66 companies emphasize wholesale: Xinya, Xinyi, Luowei, Zhengde, Jiufu, Jiuneng, Danwei, Fuzi, Dazhong, Daxia, Dalong, Huasheng, Huafu, Hualuo, Qinkang, Huikang, Zhonghua, Zhongguo, Yuanxia, Renshou, Haoyou, Haolai, Bailing, Baizhong, Haipu, Lida, Tongren, Zhile, Qingcheng, Peiji, Jinlong, Keda, Weiling, Meili, Taihe, Taixin, Yamei, Yazhou, Guotai, Guomin, Xinxing, Xinyi, Xinsheng, Xinkang, Huifeng, Fufeng, Fuer, Dehua, Yaohua, Luying, Wanguo, Yongxin, Fukang, Zhenye, Zhide, Keerden, Haimideng, Bailedeng, Meilindeng, Yien's, Sideng's, Yuexuanzhai, Anlisi, Habate, Qimoke, and Huaxingchang. The following 14 companies emphasize retail: Shijie, Zhonghe, Zhongou, Zhongde, Minghua, Xianghua, Dongfang, Dongnan, Baode, Huade, Huacheng, Tianyi, Chongji, and Dashengtang. They cooperate with each other and seek progress every day. In addition to the Western medicine departments of the Sincere, Wing On, Sun Sun, and The Sun department stores, there are also dozens of companies such as Lizhi, Guotai, Watson's, and Lao Deji that have not joined the association. They must also abide by the industry regulations set by the association in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the ministry. In recent years, the efficacy of self-made new medicines has been able to keep pace with imported products of the same nature, and the prices are much lower. Therefore, sales of foreign goods have decreased day by day, and many rights and interests have been recovered every year. Taking the business in the 27th year of the Republic of China as an example, the wholesale aspect has decreased compared to before the war due to inconvenient transportation, difficult transportation, poor people in the occupied areas, weak purchasing power, and sluggish business; occasionally, several products are essential for home travel and are easy to carry, so sales have not decreased, which is an exception. On the retail side, the number of people in Shanghai has surged, and people from all over the world have mostly escaped to Shanghai, who have been weathered and suffered hardships. Once they catch a cold, they are prone to illness, so sales have increased compared to before the 813 Incident last year; and as foreign exchange has tightened, raw material prices have soared, and those with more inventory have made more profits. Many pharmacies in other cities have closed down due to the war. Although they were changed to cash transactions after August 13 last year, the accounts released before August 13 could not be recovered, and they suffered great losses. In terms of overall calculation, due to the increase in the price of goods, the sales volume in the 27th year was less than the previous year; in terms of the amount of goods in and out, it was more than the previous year, and each company had a surplus. However, the amount of surplus depends on the adequacy of its inventory.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Recent Construction Industry in Shanghai Tang Zenan, Shan Qingfu <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13 Incident, most of the people in Hongkou and Nanshi areas have fled into the concessions, so the population of the concessions has surged, and the original houses have been completely rented out. Even those that have been abandoned for many years are rented at a good price. Later, those who came to Shanghai to avoid the war became more and more numerous, and the supply and demand situation became even more disparate. A single bed needed dozens of gold, and the monopolization of the market and speculation led to daily disputes; it is inevitable where there is profit.</p>
<p>In the spring of this year, the construction industry was greatly active as a result, and a large number of houses were built separately. However, the method was mostly to have the tenants decide and pay all the expenses required for the project, and then they could live for a certain number of years, or sell the base and the house together, which could solve part of the problem; however, it was also limited to those with financial resources who could purchase it, while those without financial resources still could not quench their thirst by looking at plums.</p>
<p>Currently, the price of construction materials has increased by 5% to 100% compared to before due to the soaring foreign exchange, traffic congestion, and special circumstances, and the construction cost has naturally increased accordingly. Those who need houses have no ability to operate on their own, and those who have the ability to invest must also calculate the interest they should get, so the increase in the price of houses is also a matter of course. Now, the market prices of ordinary building materials before and after the war are listed below as an example for comparison:</p>
<p>Since the demand for construction is in short supply and land prices have soared, it is inevitable; however, those who come are still endless, not being deterred by the high prices. This is because Shanghai, although it has formed an isolated island, can still maintain the surface of safety, so factories and houses are thriving together. According to recent statistics:</p>
<p>More than 1,000 new factories, more than 1,000 shops,</p>
<p>More than 3,000 houses, and more than 400 residences</p>
<p>The various houses currently being built have mostly found ways to reduce the materials used, or slightly changed the grade of materials, in order to balance the cost; however, compared to before, it can no longer be calculated in reason. A large number of wooden houses have been built in the western district to temporarily meet the needs; the residents below the middle class cannot afford it, so they have to gather here. Of course, it is not in line with the law, but it is necessary to give them accommodation and help them out of their poverty.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Shipping Industry Over the Last Century by Runmin <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Over the last century, the British firm Jardine Matheson and its various founders have diligently managed their business, relying on the combination of trade between the East and the West to integrate the ancient civilizations of the East with the mechanical progress of the West, benefiting all parties. Based on this commercial partnership, the friendship has not only lasted for over a century but is also expected to flourish in the future.</p>
<p>When Reverend Gutzlaff served as a translator for Jardine Matheson in Guangzhou in 1834, he often traveled the seas on Jardine Matheson's ships. Reverend Gutzlaff once wrote a letter to Dr. Jardine, saying:</p>
<p>"Your Excellency has done your utmost to assist in promoting free trade between the Western countries and China; a satisfactory result will be achieved in science and commerce in the future."</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that Jardine Matheson has always been uninvolved in political issues, relying solely on business to enhance cultural and moral exchange between both sides, a result that could never be achieved by those involved in politics. Therefore, the motto "serving as the purpose of doing business" has become the company's guiding principle. During these extraordinary times, the company's reputation has remained intact, which can be traced back to this very principle.</p>
<p>A brief history of Jardine Matheson can be described as follows:</p>
<p>In 1802, Dr. Jardine, then working for the East India Company, recognized the potential for development in Far Eastern trade. However, restricted by the company's regulations, which prevented employees from extensively managing businesses, he resigned from his position at the East India Company and set sail for Australia. He happened to meet MacNagg, and after a conversation, they became close friends. At the time, MacNagg was the manager of MacNagg &amp; Co. and had already obtained a business license issued by the East India Company.</p>
<p>Matheson was then working in a store in Calcutta run by his uncle. Due to his adventurous spirit, he went to Guangzhou in 1818 and joined MacNagg &amp; Co., jointly funded by Jardine and MacNagg. Jardine transported goods between China and India, while Matheson was stationed in India, distributing all goods shipped from the Far East by Jardine. MacNagg traveled between Guangzhou and Macau, acting as an agent for imported goods from India and the Straits Settlements.</p>
<p>After MacNagg &amp; Co. was dissolved on June 30, 1832, Jardine Matheson (also known as Jardine's) was officially established on July 1 of the same year. The current taipan of the company, Sir Jardine, is the great-nephew of Dr. Jardine. Most of the current directors of the company also come from this esteemed family. Their birthplace is the parish of Denfee in Scotland.</p>
<p>After the Treaty of Nanking was signed on August 29, 1842, Shanghai was opened as a trading port on November 17 of the following year. By the end of the year, seven foreign ships had arrived, the largest of which was Jardine Matheson's "Ilyza Stewart," with a tonnage of 423 tons.</p>
<p>At that time, there were no shipping companies in China, so those engaged in trade had to own their own ships. Jardine Matheson possessed a large number of such vessels. Most of the famous clippers flew the "white water, blue sea, one" flag.</p>
<p>Trade between northern and southern China began in 1833 with the brig "Mermaid." Subsequently, Jardine Matheson ships also traveled along the coast and within the Yangtze River. When Japan opened its ports in 1858, Jardine Matheson was among the first to send ships. The grandfather of the current managing director, Mr. William Keswick, was very interested in Japanese trade. He devoted most of his life to promoting trade between Japan and foreign countries.</p>
<p>These businesses were later merged to form the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company, engaged in increasing trade between India and the Far East. Currently, five large vessels regularly operate between Calcutta and the Far East.</p>
<p>In 1829, Matheson introduced the steam engine to the Far East. He hired a tugboat, the "Forbes," to tow the fully loaded sailing ship "The Mechane" to China. Confident in his success, he bet that if they did not reach their destination within three months, he would pay a penalty of one thousand gold coins. Unfortunately, due to unfavorable weather, they arrived two days later than expected, and Matheson's initial plan failed.</p>
<p>However, this type of experiment was not repeated, as it was discovered that there was no suitable coal in Guangzhou for the application of steam engines. Later, the "Forbes" used timber instead of coal as fuel, fully loaded with cargo, and sailed back to Calcutta, promising the cargo owners that if they arrived at their destination within one month, the freight would be halved. This trip was considered successful.</p>
<p>In 1835, the company planned to ship the first steamship to China for use between Guangzhou and Macau. However, due to the lack of precedent, it was rejected by the Manchu Emperor with a rescript. Therefore, although the ship's engine was already installed, it was forced to be removed. The ship then operated as a sailing ship between various coastal ports.</p>
<p>In the same year, the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company's clipper "Sylph" sailed from Calcutta to Lintin in 17 days and 17 hours. This sailing speed record has not been broken to this day.</p>
<p>In 1844, after signing a contract, the company began the first steam passenger service between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, with the ship named "Corsair." Therefore, it can be said that the use of steamships on the Chinese coast began in 1844. The great power of machinery replaced the natural force of wind, and the poetic white sails in the clear blue sea could no longer compete with steamships.</p>
<p>The steamships at that time were single-decked, and the cabins were all located around the paddle wheels. The stern wheelers known today had not yet been invented. In the turbulent sea, the sound of the paddle wheels splashing water was constant, and one can imagine the suffering of travelers.</p>
<p>However, the increase in speed was the most effective measure, so all shortcomings were improved and perfected. The company's fleet of ships rapidly expanded, and Jardine Matheson ships could be found in major cities in China, Japan, and Calcutta. The initial steamships had a load capacity of only 500 tons, but they gradually expanded. Today, the scale of Jardine Matheson ships is so large that it has reached its limit due to the restrictions of inland river draft and dock capacity.</p>
<p>Today, the Indo-China Steam Navigation Company (part of Jardine Matheson) has a fleet of ships with perfect facilities, comparable to any shipping company in the world. Although it cannot be fully expanded due to environmental constraints, it is practically sufficient. The company's recently built "Desheng, Yongsheng, Taisheng" have expanded trade along the Chinese coast from Tianjin through various major ports to Haiphong, traveling at 15 nautical miles per hour. These types of ships have exceeded the speed of other transport ships traveling along the Chinese coast. Taking "Taisheng" as an example, the voyage from Shantou to Shanghai takes only 42 hours.</p>
<p>As for the four new ships that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company previously ordered from the UK, they have been resold to the company by the Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) Committee and have been reconditioned. Although the speed is only 12 nautical miles, the voyage from Hong Kong via Shantou to Shanghai, even with the northeast monsoon, takes only three and a half days. These types of ships have been renamed Yisheng, Yusheng, Hesheng, and Minsheng. The increased speed of these ships will surely be appreciated by cargo owners, freight forwarders, and passengers. The cabins have also been greatly improved, especially the four ships mentioned above. The facilities for various classes of Chinese passengers are unmatched by any other ships operating along the Chinese coast. Jardine Matheson will operate these excellent ships separately along the coast. With the cooperation of cargo owners and passengers, the ships will arrive and depart on time, benefiting both cargo owners and passengers.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson has made great efforts to adapt to the current difficult environment. For this reason, Jardine Matheson's flag can still be seen flying throughout China, and its navigation along the coast and inland rivers remains effective and pleasant. The current situation is similar to the early days of the company, and temporary plans and new routes must be developed to meet the needs of the public. The widespread distribution of Jardine Matheson's management offices today shows that it has far exceeded its past scope.</p>
<p>To achieve the above objectives while respecting treaty terms, the company has established close cooperation with the Zhonghe Transportation Company, managed by Mr. Zhang Ruizhi. Zhonghe Transportation Company has had many years of relationship with Jardine Matheson, and since 1935, it has implemented the issuance of responsible intermodal bills of lading directly from various ports to inland areas, even as far as Xi'an Prefecture in Shaanxi Province. This approach has been quite effective and has greatly benefited cargo owners.</p>
<p>In August 1937, traffic on the Yangtze River was disrupted. Fortunately, the company's loyal service enabled the transportation of tens of thousands of tons of goods between Shanghai and Hankou, rerouting them through Jiangbei. This was implemented for several months and proved very effective. More recently, the company has cooperated with Zhonghe Transportation Company to shift its focus to the Haiphong route, handling the Shanghai-Yunnan intermodal transportation.</p>
<p>Since August 1938, Zhonghe Transportation Company has established branches and agencies in Haiphong, Kunming, and Chongqing, and all goods are transported through intermodal transportation systems, flowing smoothly throughout the regions. These measures are implemented entirely in accordance with Jardine Matheson's business policy, without involving other interests than commercial ones. Recently, a branch and warehouse have also been established in Guangzhou Bay, with large quantities of goods transported inland via motorways.</p>
<p>These facilities are fraught with difficulties, but those involved are able to overcome them with a spirit of enterprise. The way things are done today is different from the past, but only those who are brave and unafraid of difficulties can succeed in their careers. Jardine Matheson has faced difficulties not just today, but today's Jardine Matheson, with the support of its loyal employees and the full cooperation of all colleagues at Zhonghe Transportation Company, can overcome difficulties with an indomitable spirit. Jardine Matheson's reputation today has also been built on this spirit.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Sweeping Away Counterfeit Money <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Dun</p>
<p>For nearly two years of the war of resistance, our country's finance has remained as stable as ever, and the credibility of legal tender has become increasingly prominent. For this, the enemy has racked their brains, attempting to disrupt our finance and fantasizing about undermining the credibility of our legal tender. For example, manufacturing counterfeit currency issued by the "United Reserve Bank," forcing its use in controlled areas, absorbing legal tender to obtain foreign exchange, and manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit notes to allow unscrupulous individuals to mix them into the market. But these have been properly resisted by our government, dealing a significant blow to the enemy's conspiracy. Just as the enemy was at their wit's end and extremely frustrated, the Equalization Fund for maintaining the credibility of legal tender was suddenly established. This was tantamount to a head-on blow to the enemy. Therefore, it is no wonder that the Japanese warlords were so anxious that they were at their wit's end, prompting their mouthpieces to say something like: "It can be said that Britain's maintenance of Chinese legal tender is tantamount to joining China's economic guerrilla warfare" and barking out for revenge!</p>
<p>There is no doubt that our country's legal tender will become more stable in the future; but can we assume that Japan will therefore abandon this conspiracy? Absolutely not! Not only will they not, but the enemy will use their claws to expand and intensify this aggression! Recently, the enemy has forcibly used the counterfeit currency of the counterfeit "United Reserve Bank" in North China, and the Ministry of Finance has recently received confidential reports stating that the Japanese are counterfeiting huge sums of counterfeit money in Dalian, with 22 million yuan already attempting to be mixed into various occupied areas. Therefore, it has specifically telegraphed to the provincial governments to instruct their subordinates and chambers of commerce to closely guard against it. All of these are clear evidence.</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy's forced use of "United Reserve Bank" counterfeit currency in North China, the first symposium record of the Economic Supplement of this newspaper (March 27), the article "The Future of Legal Tender Ban in North China" has already provided a detailed and thorough explanation, so there is no need for me to repeat it. What I want to say here is how we should deal with the problem of counterfeit legal tender that is organized, planned, and used on a large scale in the market.</p>
<p>Counterfeit yarn mixing into the market with genuine ones did not begin now. It had been prevalent before the war and became a confidant concern in the financial industry. However, at that time, first, there were laws that could be sanctioned, and the strict crackdown by military and police authorities made the general unscrupulous people have scruples; second, because the scale of counterfeit money manufacturing agencies was small, and the printing technology was also very poor, even those without much experience could identify it, so its threat was not very great. However, the current situation is very different, the disruptors are not small, but deliberately will not weaken our legal tender and will not give up. They have a large-scale manufacturing agency and sophisticated printing techniques, and they are mass-producing. Therefore, the harm caused is far greater than in the past. If we do not rise up to sweep away counterfeit money, the impact on the credibility of legal tender and people's lives will be unimaginable. Therefore, whether it is to consolidate finance to ensure the final victory, or to avoid our own losses, eliminating counterfeit money is a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I met a friend Mr. So-and-so who worked in the financial industry, and when talking about this matter, he also had a strong sense of agreement. After a heated discussion, we reached four conclusions. Although these four conclusions cannot completely eliminate counterfeit money, they can at least make the invaders feel thorny, and finally force them to give up this poisonous scheme. The conclusions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Urge the military and police authorities in the concession to strictly crack down.</p>
<p>(2) The silver and money industry associations and various trade associations should stipulate a "unified" drama record and notify all members to immediately stamp it when they encounter counterfeit money; and make this stipulated signature public to the society.</p>
<p>(3) Collect various counterfeit tickets and exhibit them publicly so that the general public can guard against them</p>
<p>(4) Those who have special experience in identifying counterfeit tickets should announce the weaknesses of counterfeit money to the public (Regarding this point, I believe that the revenue and expenditure personnel of financial institutions that have the most contact with banknotes should assume this responsibility.)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Talking About "Not Eating Shark Fin" <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Shark fin is a noble food in cuisine, a delicacy among mountain delicacies and seafood, but also an unparalleled luxury. Its origin, in addition to Luzon and Borneo, is Japan; although China's coastline is long, and it is a famous place for producing giant sharks, due to fishing methods, it has not yet reached scientific equipment, so relying solely on indigenous methods of capture, shark fin is extremely difficult to produce. The source of shark fin in Shanghai is mostly imported from Japan, and only a small number are imported from Southeast Asia; therefore, from the current standpoint of the war of resistance, it is definitely said that shark fin is all "inferior goods," so as to make the people completely stop eating, there is really no place for excessive words.</p>
<p>Recently, the Chamber of Commerce of the city has advised all shops and households that wine banquets necessary for celebrations, weddings, funerals, etc., should abolish the use of shark fin, in order to save extravagance, fulfill their conscience duties, and help refugees; this is both from the principle of "saving to help the needy" and "National Spiritual Mobilization," and it is a matter of urgency, which should be earnestly practiced by every wealthy Chinese on the isolated island. At the same time, in order to preserve the national strength of the war of resistance and not make unnecessary consumption - especially this consumption contains the element of "funding the enemy," then it should be completely abolished!</p>
<p>However, if other precious dishes are still used after not eating shark fin, such as replacing them with bird's nest, white fungus, bear paws, deer tendons, etc., then although there is no longer the blame of "funding the enemy," it still greatly violates the principles of "economy" and "spiritual mobilization," and there is still the suspicion of "changing the soup without changing the medicine"!</p>
<p>Our goal: to transfer all the money saved from "not eating shark fin" at every wine banquet to disaster relief and donations.</p>
<p>Fellow compatriots in Shanghai! Let us no longer lose this conscience-driven awakening, forever, okay?</p>

<h3 id="e99">Three Years Later, The Sorrows of an Apprentice <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— (Wuguang)</p>
<p>Our company's regulations: The apprenticeship period for apprentices is three years. In the first year of entry, the monthly fee is two yuan, and then it increases by one or two yuan each year. After three years, you can receive a salary of ten yuan per month.</p>
<p>Three years seems like a long time, and the hope is this meager ten yuan. But in this year of "difficult to eat," "less porridge and more monks," so I obediently came in.</p>
<p>Finally, the long time slipped by in a gray atmosphere, but the hope became a broken illusion. Why? ...</p>
<p>What we receive every month from the fat hand of the accounting section chief is still two dilapidated banknotes. Can we complain about our fate? So, we started to resist:</p>
<p>"Mr. ×, we have been here for three years!"</p>
<p>"That's right. But after 'August 13th,' the factory has been stagnant, and the company has no income. You should know that."</p>
<p>We had nothing to say, took the two dilapidated banknotes, and silently left the accounting office.</p>
<p>But we also know that the company's business was booming in the past few years: the factory started night work, the prices of goods kept rising, and the accumulated fund accumulated more than one million.</p>
<p>So, has this one million yuan been depleted after "August 13th"? No! Not at all. But the company borrowed the name of "August 13th" and even refused to pay the meager ten yuan per month that we should have received after three years.</p>
<p>Does such a large company have to haggle over these few yuan? Moreover, the staff has also been laid off, and the salary has also been deducted.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is an unreasonable pressure! We were deceived. It was two yuan three years ago, and it is still two yuan three years later. Then what about four years later, five years later? China's war of resistance is long-term, and our monthly fee of two yuan per month should also be long-term, right?</p>
<p>And the age is increasing year by year. Who has deprived us of our precious years? Who has eroded our youth? Even a meager and pitiful hope has been shattered. - Ah - we were deceived.</p>
<p>Resist? There is no such thing. Anyway, there are many people in this year, if you don't want to be here, get out!</p>
<p>Even further, unite the same class and use collective power to fight. But we have recognized this era. During the war of resistance, we do not want to stir up a wave of struggle.</p>
<p>So, we are depressed.</p>
<p>We have no extravagant hopes. We hope that the company authorities can understand our small sorrow and fulfill the previous promise: and then let everyone cooperate to tide over this difficult and great era.</p>
<h3 id="e100">River Love Song <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Ruhua</p>
<p>"St. Louis Blues"</p>
<p>Paramount Pictures Production, Nanjing Grand Theater Screening</p>
<p>Dorothy Lamour and Lloyd Nolan Co-star</p>
<p>Since "Animal Crackers" and "The Jungle Princess," Dorothy Lamour's name has been deeply imprinted on the minds of the audience. Lamour's alluring and provocative singing voice is indeed loved by the general young audience, but her plump figure, charming eyes, slender hair, and Southern flair are all loved by audiences who love Hollywood works. Therefore, even if Lamour only makes a cameo appearance singing a song in "College Holiday," it is also used to call on the audience by the character that Dorothy Lamour plays.</p>
<p>"River Love Song" does have a Lamour-style story, and it copies the form of "The Boat Show," and the romance happens in the "St. Louis Blues" showboat on the Mississippi River. The story is too simple to be simpler. Lamour, because she doesn't want to play the role of a South Sea woman in a brocade apron anymore, ignores the manager's contract and escapes to the "St. Louis Blues" showboat. So, she falls in love with the boat owner Dave and eventually becomes a family.</p>
<p>In our memory, there are many examples of similar stories, but there are also many that can give us technical learning due to the superiority of the compilation and direction, but "River Love Song" has failed in these two points.</p>
<p>First: This story takes place on a showboat. Due to the lack of detailed scene division, it appears very trivial and chaotic. It is also a pity that Dorothy Lamour cannot be given more opportunities to act besides singing.</p>
<p>Second: The director does use comedic skills and small gimmicks to win the laughter of the audience, but he also cannot focus on the main line, rendering, emphasizing, making it deep and moving. As for using music and the reflection on the river to set off the showboat's mood, there are indeed scenes that make people leisurely fascinated, but it cannot give people a feeling of dissolving. The biggest drawback is that the love process between Lamour and Lloyd Nolan is written very vaguely. For example, when Lloyd Nolan specifically selected a song and asked Lamour to sing it, Lamour was so sad that she could not sing because of the manager's newspaper advertisement, but the director let it go faintly. The scene where Lamour came back was also not prominent enough. Other connections are not clear enough, which is also a major flaw.</p>
<p>Just like the last scene, which should be the climax of the film, although the director has taken care of all aspects, the excitement may be excitement, but from the black woman singing until Lamour finishes singing, the excitement is only superficial.</p>
<p>And Lamour finally appeared in the apron of a native woman, which may be a sign of her love for Lloyd Nolan, and it can also be said to be her forgiveness for the manager, but it is just the opposite of her refusal to play the native woman at the beginning. This is not so much a contradiction of the playwright as a contradiction of the Hollywood film company. Sonja Henie became famous for skating, will they give up skating movies in the future? Even if a movie is made to make the audience tired of watching it, who dares to say that Sonja Henie's next work is not a skating movie? Lamour's apron is the same, no exception.</p>
<p>Lloyd Nolan used to specialize in detective films, and Dave here is not outstanding.</p>
<p>The few songs here, such as Moonlight at Shadow, will be popular in the dance halls, because they are all full of blue emotions.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Paired Swallows and Warbling Orioles Cast Reflections, Yue Silk and Wu Brocade Weave Seven Patterns on the Loom</p>
<p>At this moment, Tong Haiying took a photograph of the He family's two sisters and their three younger brothers together. Then, He Liyu took a photograph of the three children, and their nanny, Ms. Kang Ning, was also included. Afterwards, they went around for another tour before returning. The two Misses He had been staying here for several days and had become quite familiar with the sisters here. However, they all had duties and could not accompany them on outings all the time, and they could also wander around on their own without disturbing their duties. Furthermore, the two sisters were both industrialists and specialists in the textile industry. Even in that small town, they took the opportunity to investigate everything. When their father left, he made sure to keep in touch by telegram and letter at any time. They knew where their father was staying in Beiping, so the day after arriving in Anle Town, they sent him a telegram, reporting that they had arrived at Zhu Ai’ren’s place and asking him not to worry. Although Anle Town was a small town, it had both a telegraph office and a post office, and transportation was very convenient. Moreover, in recent years, domestic telegraph rates in China had dropped to a very low level. Because telecommunications had developed, and revenue had increased, and since telegraphs were operated by the government for the convenience of the people, it was naturally made even more convenient. In many small cities and towns, the telegraph office and the post office were together. Just like in Anle Town, the telegraph office was in a corner of the post office. The reason was that the post office was very busy, while the telegraph office was relatively quiet. The two Misses He planned to stay in Anle Town for at least two weeks. If their father were to send a telegram or letter during these two weeks, it would only need to be forwarded to Freedom Village. Because from Anle Town to Freedom Village, it was not a long way, with automobiles and steamers running back and forth all day long, and countless people passing through. After the two Misses He sent the telegram to their father, they also wrote a detailed letter. In the pre-war postal service, because transportation was blocked in many parts of China, a letter often took several days to arrive. In inland China, where boats and vehicles were not available, and mountains and rivers separated places, it could take more than ten or even dozens of days. As for remote areas, it was possible to receive a letter every few months. But now it is very different. You should know that the post-war recovery power of our China is extremely strong, and the first reason is the convenience of transportation. Not only has it restored pre-war transportation, but it has also opened up many post-war transportation routes. Therefore, the government authorities are working hard. Because China's land is so vast and its people are so numerous, the more developed transportation is, the more developed the industry will be, and the progress of the country and society will be like a heavy rain, unstoppable.
