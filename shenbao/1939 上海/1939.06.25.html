<p>社評</p>
<h3>天津事件與美國</h3>
<p>天津事件發生到今已經十多天了，英國還是首鼠兩端。所謂「報復」，所謂「强硬對付」，至少在目前還不過表現了一種準備的姿態，夜長夢多，侵略者的凶燄正不知何時才得戢止！然而，在這滿天晦暗中，却也透露出一線曙光，那就是美國的態度正逐漸明朗起來。</p>
<p>在中國，在美國，乃至全世界的輿論，都認爲美國的行動，在今日對遠東問題具有決定的力量。日方當然未嘗昧於此理，所以當天津事件發動時，就赶緊表示媚態，聲明對美國人特別優惠。當然日本的眞意，並不想永遠優惠美國，在所謂建立東亞新秩序的口號之下，歐美在遠東的利益，反正同樣地會受排擠的；目前日本的媚美，不過企圖緩和國際空氣，和離間民治國家的魔術罷了。總之，日本對於美國內心的忌憚，那是無論什麼小信小惠的表面文章所掩飾不了，而是美國人所看得淸淸楚楚的。</p>
<p>老實說：美國在天津的利益關係並不怎樣重大，全市美僑不過四百名，財產不過一千二百萬元，假定美國是只重私利的國家，美國對於天津事件正不妨隔岸觀火。假定美國爲私利而出賣天津利益，日本準情願加利補償。而且美國如果要自私自利，國內正有代表一部分資本家利益的所謂孤立派加以歌誦；正有日本所頤使的「準」代言人，加以讚美。自從中日開戰以來，日本一向就利用着孤立派與準代言人的存在，時常向美國傳送秋波；目前更因爲美國在天津並沒有主要的利害關係，索性再施展離間的伎倆，企圖美國從此離開了遠束的民治國家聯合陣綫。</p>
<p>然而日本的企圖顯然又失敗了。美國對遠束夙主門戶開放政策，這在過去，磕破了瓜分的陰謀，在目前却成爲反對侵略的壁壘，保障遠東乃至世界和平的鐵則。美國對遠東問題從來沒有漠視過，吾則何必在一九二一年召集太平洋會議？更何必在九一八以後大聲疾呼抗議對華侵略？原來遠東大局一經動搖，太平洋風雲豈得安靜？假使太平洋不得安靜，美國豈但一時感受威脅，簡直是放棄了優越地位，而把美金工資所造的軍備，與東方低工資所造的軍備來競爭生產，競爭買賣利鈍。這又是公忠體國的美國人所看得淸情楚楚的。天津地方對美國的關係雖然並不怎樣重要，可是這次事件對美國無非是一種試金石，「是可忍孰不可忍」，假使天津的利益可以放棄，上海的利益何如？甚至關島，雅浦島，檀香山羣島，斐列賓羣島等處，又何如？因此，日本的一些小惠手段，斷不能動搖美國的根本國策。不過自從中日戰爭發生以後，美國一向準備着與民治國家聯合動作，不願單獨發動，、所以此决天津事件初起，美國一時不能立即有所動作；然而美國政府第一天就聲明着對於遠東事件必須與各民治國家態度一致，這不啻已是不受蠱惑的一種嚴正表示。果然本月二十一日美國正式向日本提出了反對天津封鎖限制的抗議，而且在天津抗議以前，又先提出關於轟炸美國財產和反對鼓浪嶼封鎖的爾種强硬抗議，表示美國對遠束一切問題的立塲是一貫的。</p>
<p>美國如果聽受日方的蠱惑，對天津事件抱着隔岸觀火的態度，那末他會得到怎樣的報酬？美國的報紙上已說得很淸楚：「自日人封鎖天津英法租界之後，美人利益亦同樣遭受打擊，日人之意，全在試探西方民治國家反對東亞新秩序政策之準備與決心；至於美國所受之打擊何以與英法同？因全部外人在華之經濟利益，其地位將以此一事件之結果爲前例也」。美國對於天津事件如果不抱着隔岸觀火的態度，那麼應該採取怎樣的立塲？美國政府人員也有很質直的說明：「中國境內不斷發生事故之後，美國將不得不在下開二途之中擇一行之。質言之，苛不完全退出遠東，即須堅强出而抵抗」。這就是美國必須參加天津問題出來仗義執言最重要的理由。</p>
<p>侵略者的野心，當然不是這樣的仗義執言所能遏止的；美國既然能仗義執言，當然還可能發動進一步的實際力量。况且自從天津問題發生以後，華盛頓倫敦巴黎間接洽頻繁，美國能出來說話，民治國家間當然已經有了一種契合。所以今後天津問題的怎樣開展，全看各民治國契合到怎樣的程度和實際力量怎樣的發揮。美國一向是中國的良友，在地理上是太平洋束西對峙的兩大國家，在歷史上彼此之問從來很少惡感；允其兩國國民，因傳敎經商留學等種種關係，很有密切的接觸，建立了兩國間的情感。八一三以來，美國對中國的援助本不算少；但是遠東反侵略國際統一戰綫的完成，還端賴美國起來領導。因爲祇有美國對遠東問題最少牽制，最適合做這種領導的工作。中國人民對美國的仗義精神，一向十分欽佩；而在欽佩之外，還存着殷切的期待。這又是美國人所知道得明明白白的。這次美國對天津問題的過問，不但應該是天津問題本身的曙光，還應該是遠東國際反侵略統一戰綫完成的起點。</p>
<h3>美重視在華權益　倘受侵犯必以全力維護　目下對日態度漸趨堅强　亞洲艦隊行動極堪注意</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）目前美國一輩民衆所給予政府領袖之意見、已顯示美國民衆對遠東問題、已採取更積極的態度、至於官方態度、則認爲美方對天津事件雖無直接關係、但由日方引起之更大糾紛、美國極爲關切、彼等指出因日方行動已停阻美國商業、故已將美國捲入天津問題、同時國務部已逐漸探取堅强之立塲、拒絕日方使事件擴大之一切要求、惟官方尙不致立卽向日方探取强硬行動、事實上美方已表示願作天津事件之調停人、至於美國亞洲艦隊之行動、華盛頓觀察家予以嚴密之注意、彼等認爲該艦隊之行動、足以顯示美政府之基本政策、目前尙未經政府所批准之計劃、若被通過、必將影響日本對外貿易、而此項計劃是否將被探納、將視日方此後行動之傾向而定、國會一部份人主張以嚴厲手段對付日本、但一般孤立派人物則仍反對此種政策、（二十四日美聯社電）</p>

<h3>婚後幸福的不二法門</h3>
<p>愛人者人恒愛之。這是千古不朽的名言，一個只圖自己享受而不管人家死活的自私者，終究必將自食其惡果。我們耳所聞目所見的婚後男女的種種悲劇，不能不歸咎於封建殘餘社會裏丈夫的自私，妻是他的玩物，附屬品，至多也不過視如財產。丈夫可以任性縱慾，而妻子只好三從四德。因此，在夫婦生活中，妻子的被犧牲就以爲當然的事了。</p>
<p>智識吿訴我們女子的性潮是有週期的。因爲這個緣故，在動物界雌性動物常居優越地位。而雄性不過爲適應雌性的要求而已。像蜜蜂，蠶等動物，雄性者的唯一責任，就是爲適應雌性的交配，交配以後牠的生命也就完了，人類則因雄性者因體格的雄健，在社會上常處於優越地位。因此把女性就壓迫着，重男輕女，雖在今日文明社會中恐仍有着殘餘的勢力。在這樣男女結合不平衡的生活裏，必有一方被犧牲，但另一方也並不便宜。這是很普遍的現象，妻子因性生活的不合理，患有經亂白帶，不感不娠，或多產貧血，乳癟顏瘦，未老先衰等症，致家庭裏失却了內助。同時因丈夫的早婚縱慾，或多妻荒淫，或早年犯有自凟遺精，在性機能上每爆發種種病態，如早洩陽委，滑精漏精，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症，試問此種病態丈夫，將怎能營夫婦美滿生活，組織快樂家庭？</p>
<p>然則欲求男女婚後幸福將如何？曰：惟有男女平等，在妳體量我我體量妳的相五愛的協調中，慾的一致裏去尋求。那末，在身心上既無一方被犧牲，而可以相互得到歡慰，健康將因之增進，幸福則與健康的增進而亦日進無疆！</p>
<p>要是已因婚前的自誤與婚後生活的不合理，男女而患有上述各症，則必須及早作澈底治療，吾則因循貽誤，後患無窮！治療之法，在今日醫學昌明的時代，如能採用生殖腺內分泌補給療法，則治愈上述各症，亦並非難事。男用女用之生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，卽根據此種原理由雄壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，熊鹿，海狗等體中提取其生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成。所以品質純粹，養料完全保存，服後於一小時效力卽開始，二十四小時男則生精補腎，女則調經除帶若繼續服用，則助長發育，滋養神經，調整新陳代謝，健腦活血，於短期內可以根治各症，長服更可收延年益壽返老還童之功。所以世界名醫均推爲內分泌劑中唯一聖藥，惟男有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（五洲中西等大藥房有售）以制止遺洩則收效尤速！</p>
<h3>遺精生理與病理的判別</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>男子體內的精液，在生理學上言，就是生殖腺內分泌液，一部分由外導管而貯於精囊，待營生殖作用，一部分即直接滲於血液內以調整新陳代謝，助長發育，滋養神經，幷興奮情緒，一個健壯的未婚男子或與妻遠別的丈夫，因生理上所產生的精液過賸，在一兩月內或有一二决遺精，遺後毫不感覺倦怠頭昏等狀態者，此爲生理的溢精，但亦總以不溢爲愈佳，要是於一月之內有二三决的遣精，遺後並覺倦京腦衰者，有夢者爲夢遺，無夢者謂之滑精，皆是病態的遺精無疑，若偶見女色，或在大小便時，或用腦用力過度雖在白日亦有精液漏出者，這是遺精症象惡化後的滑精症。</p>
<p>據醫學家的結究結果，知道一滴精液等於八十滴血液的可貴，遺精一决等於失血一磅，這是多麽驚心動魄的可怕呢？所以靑年人一有遺精必須從速治愈，若因循失治，那沒有不貽後患的，遺精失治後最普遍的症象就是腦衰腎虧，發育不全，面黃肌瘦，神經衰弱等症，此種病態靑年普遍在今日社會上，不特爲學習業難以成就，即在夫婦生活上亦不能美滿爲妻憎恨，或子女無出，或自己一命嗚呼釀成人生莫大悲慘！</p>
<p>遺精並不楚不治之症，如能服特效藥物必可收藥到病除之功，特效藥物，全世界名醫均推崇「希米脫氏固精片」因服後即能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，夜得安眠，夢幻减少，遺精可於當夜立止，若因遺精失治而有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可早日根治各症，並使身體益臻健康，患者能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，則收效允速。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯美在夏季</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>在赤日炎炎，暑氣薰蒸的熱的世界裏，惟有一般健美的女性，才可以大出風頭。你瞧：她們的衣服多麽少，多麽薄，裏面僅穿一身輕鬆的汗衫褲，外面裹上蟬翼似的旗抱，有幾個穿香雲紗衣服的女性，甚至並汗衫都不穿，以這樣輕巧的打扮，無疑地，把她們所具有的特微，正似彈性豐富的彈簧槃香，一旦壓力减輕，便益發挺了起來，一對高聳的乳峯，在胸前左右並峙，而兩個乳頭，更似初發的葡萄，益顯得挺綻可愛！此外如身材的苗條，臀部的豐腴，在行動的姿態上，自然越發覺得肉感動人，美妙無比了。所以她們在處女時，便到處香噴噴爲人所愛，很如心的擇到一位多情丈夫，一旦出嫁以後，兩性間的愛情，又是非常濃厚，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，這是多麽榮耀而可喜！惟早歲曾犯自凟束胸，或月經不調，病後虧弱，白帶纏綿，營養不良，致卵巢機能遭受摧殘，影響新陳代謝作用，遂致乳峯萎癟，健美喪失者，則不但無比幸福，而且每爲丈夫所憎惡，其命運必非常悲慘！欲謀補救，祗有信賴科學，據世界著名婦科專家康德林，及美容能手威泥基博士等研究與實騐結果。均一致公認以服生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用「生殖素」，最爲對症而特效。蓋此劑係提取壯健動物的卵巢精華，更和以礦植物的補血，補腦成分，經科學方法精密配製，故服後一日夜間，卽可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼繼服用，不但可使萎癟的乳峯，日形高聳，瘦削的臂部，漸見豐腴，且能使面頰紅潤，靑春長駐。</p>

<h3>淋濁局部治療與全部治療説</h3>
<p>淋濁療法，不拘一格，有宜於局部治療者，有宜於全部治療者，各隨症適用，始免偏見之弊，而致貽誤病機。不幸現在一般市醫，往往因設備之不周，與手術之疎略，僅備數種小件之醫械，或固執成見，僅固用某種成藥，而攻擊其他設備之現代化，治療之科學化的專家。顛倒是非，混淆黑白，以冀人之受其欺，殊於醫家之道德有關。蓋隨症處治，則不拘於一格，法隨病變，而不以法待病，則頑固難愈之白濁，未有不完全爲吾人所治愈者。</p>
<p>治療淋病，局部療法，全部療法，兩者均不可廢，如淋毒在初起時，　淋菌完全集於前尿道，此時如用局部療法，未嘗不合科學之原則。但除此而外，則注射自家菌苗，以增　病抗家毒素，亦未嘗無補於病體也。若病毒已竄入血液，成爲全身傳染，如淋毒性關節炎等，則縱將尿道部分切除，亦無補於事。然而愚拙之醫家，仍誇耀其局部療法之如何神奇也。不過用全部療法時，同時又用局部療法，固亦未嘗不可耳。余於新舊一切淋病之治療方法，素採安全科學的方法爲之治療。如德國希氏血淸，德國濾淋平流電療法，自䄸菌苗，攝護腺按摩法，菩齊尿道擴張法，局部洗滌法，或先用殺菌藥液注射尿道內後，隨即用濾淋平流電療之導子插入尿道而放以電流，如此又能發揮殺菌之功。</p>

<h3>金融　流言孔多　現金跌後又回漲　　天熱祇做半日成交逹七百兩</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、僅有上午半天行市蓋因邇來天時酷熱、且本日適逢外滙週六無市、後經同業議決停市半天、唯上午形勢頗形恍惚、中途動輒竟有二三十元、然而價勢大致先猛跌而後暴漲、初因上日疲風未息、且聞外滙內盤帶硬、更以某種空氣甚　塵上、致人心益疲、現金號賣意允濃、競相拋塞不休、兼錢兌業亦稍來吐出、雖其時某金號代投機家吸收、無如扳價頗夥、故市勢傾向下疲、竟打破二千五百元大關、一度曾降達二千四百八十五元低盤、嗣後忽聞匯劃貼現回跌至八十元、且又聞市上將有五千萬元流通券發行之謠傳、人心頓被激動、買風陡起、一再呈昇、價竟飛漲七十五元、重回出二千五百元大關、而達二千五百六十元高峯、卒因某錢兌業獲利吐售而稍回挫、結果以二千五百五十元收槃、較隔昨軋跌十二元、半天交易尙旺、達七百兩光景、銀樓飾金亦隨之先跌後回、結果小二元、海關金與中英純金等一致均平、</p>
<p>烚赤再跌十二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞外滙繼續報硬、且人心本疲、買者觀望、故開市即做小三十二元、現金號共塞於銀樓帮五十兩、價均二千五百三十元、時塲中某種空氣謠傳甚熾、加之現金號繼續傾吐、但某余號代投機商趁機扳價吸收、現金號賣予某金號五十兩、價五百二十八元、繼之現金號又塞予某金號九十兩、價五百二十元、後某錢兌業亦跟踪吐售某金號五十兩、價五百十五元、不久現金號再售予某金號五十兩、價五百十元、時某金號止進觀望、市勢愈疲、立破入五百元大關、銀樓帮賣予某錢兌業五十兩、價四百九十五兀、瞬息處於賣風下又猛跌十元、錢兌業互做五十兩、價四百八十五元、爲當日最低價、此後賣者漸缺、且聞匯割貼現大跌、已破入百元關內、時千元僅貼出八十元、且其時利多傳說、致進戶趁低競相搜羅竟一刹那抬起四十五允、錢兌業進證券帮五十兩、價五百三十元、繼而某錢兌業獲利吐予現金號二十兩、價五百二十五元、未幾某錢兌業又吐予同業五十兩、價五百三十元、時售者更稀、且另一錢兌業代殷富買意頗切、竟又在抬三十元、錢兌業（代殷富）進銀樓帮及同　各五十兩、價均五百六十元爲當日最高價、時殷富進意雖濃、奈某錢兌業獲利又來吐售、潛勢略回、錢兌業互做五十兩、價五百五十五元、十一時三刻錢兌　又互做五十兩、二千五百五十元爲午收價、午後因天時酷熱且適値週六外洒無市、致同業議決停市半天、結果較上日軋跌十二元、半天七十五元上落、現金號之本牌金照烚赤價較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十分光景、據詢均鮮有做開、</p>
<p>飾金亦先跌後回</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初開大同行仍懸二百六十元、十時十五分因聞炩赤開市、即疲三十餘元、故亦掛小三元、十時五十五分、因烚赤已破入五百元關內、故又猛落四元、後至十一時五十分、因烚赤回高六七十元、故亦回起五元、午後因烚赤市塲休業、致均無變化、計結果均掛小二元、計大同行改懸二百五十八元、新同行爲二百五十穴元、收進二百五十元、</p>
<p>中英純金均不動</p>
<p>二十三日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊轉平、致亦米起　化、每盎司仍屬七鎊八先令六辦士、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦仍爲一千二百十二元三角、掛牌海關金仍平、計二元三角九分穴厘、上海樓準標金價亦未更動，計一千二百〇七元六角、</p>
<h3>外滙無特殊變化　日行仍塞形勢續鬆</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况滙豐掛牌悉無變化、暗市情勢、雖洋行界結款仍繁、無如外行竇意蓬勃、且日行正金等亦復來大量塞出、致形勢續告鬆動、唯半日間尙無特殊愛化、成交尙旺、至港滙因外行供塞亦力、故亦續鬆、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近還均升一八七五、紐的銀行呆定、倫敦生金亦未更動、匯兌英對美·對滬·對法均平、美對英未更、對滬大三角五分、對法長〇六二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金六辦士六八七五、美滙十三元〇九三七五、較之前收英平、美長〇三一二五、開後日行正金續來吐予外行滙豐·麥加利等現貨英金六辦士七五、繼而外行轉吐予洋行現貨英金六辦士六八七五、市勢略硬、迨睢豐掛牌褐曉勿動、及白銀平衡揭曉大一分、計徵百分之一·七五時洋行叉來扒結匯豐華比現貨英金六辦士六八七五及七五繼而再來結進美行現貨美滙十三元一二五、將近午刻、英美兩滙、成交轉稀、但港滙則略有成交、計外行華義·荷蘭相繼塞予洋行現貨價四十五元二五、狀况亦硬、延至午收銀行現貨賣價、英金六辦士七五、美滙十三元一八七五、結果較之前收、英長〇六二五、美硬一二五、港滙照成交價軋過亦賤二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<h3>英美金票　交易復盛</h3>
<p>昨日英純金與英美滙兌俱未更動、本埠外滙、洋行結款甚殷、外銀行供結暢連、日銀行需要法幣、回出英匯頗湧、市况過程趨鬆、結果英匯爲六辦士七五、較上日長零六二五、美匯爲十三元一八七五、亦升一二五、週六下午無市、炩赤開盤、因外滙趨鬆、金號錢兌業供給頗股、市價做低三十二元、入後流言頗盛、市况益虛弱、跌至二千四百八十五元、金號趁低吸納、且貼現率降低、又可奪取現幣、買風趨盛、午收爲二千五百五十元、結果較上日下跌十二元、下午交易未做開、外幣英美金鎊、需要復股、供給尙暢、市價穩定、英美金票、交易頗盛、因供給未暢、市價堅俏、法郎票新加坡票荷蘭票、需要頗稀、俱趨下降、日金票需要殷、市價回高、晚市爲九角七分一釐、朝鮮票市况穩定、仍爲八角六分、公會交易稀少、永豐出實祥進美金票一千元、厚吉出通源進英金票五十鎊，昨日市價、英金票升一角、美金票升二分、法郞票降二釐、新加坡票降五分、荷蘭票降一角、斐律賓票升五分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>貼現續跌十元</h3>
<p>昨日滙劃票據貼現率、漸較穩定、每千元由一百元漸見步低至八十元、但至下午忽又回上十元至九十元、比前日續低十元、錢業拆息仍未更、上下午均掛二角五分、</p>
<h3>英印銀市况堅挺</h3>
<p>二十三日倫敦電、銀市印度買進、投機家賣出、交易少市商平、收盤後市况帶硬、大衆照掛牌價高〇六二五買進、但出者仍無供意、大條銀近遠期均續漲一八七五、又紐的電美現貨呆定如故、叉孟買電、印銀市况堅挺、現貨與七月均長九安那、八月亦昇七安那、</p>
<h3>新限制提存辦法之眞相</h3>
<p>財政部近鑒於滬市自外滙暗盤行市緊縮以後，一般資產階級及投機者，競購外滙，再加外商銀行因現鈔頭寸關係，吸收信用借款，即將外匯暗市做成近賤遠貴，近期與遠期差額巨大，外滙套息利率萵至數分，因此近日資金流入外商銀行之數，甚爲警人，若不規定適當辦法，本市華商銀行之資金，勢必逃避一空。財部爲防止資金逃避，安定上海金融市塲起見，援有馬電之限制提存辦法，對於普通法幣存戶，每週支取現鈔以五百元爲限，而對於本市櫃劃存款，以及上海以外之其他各埠，仍照舊法辦理，不受新辦法之限制。且本市銀錢業於二十二日召集緊急會議，規定實施辦法七項，已在各報披露，可見此决限制提存辦法，意旨在於限制華商銀行鉅額法幣存款之資金逃避，對於零星小額儲蓄存款，毫無影饗，事實甚爲明顯。但因存戶未有明瞭，誤信謠言，聞自二十二日起至二十四日止三天，本市各銀錢業之活期往來存款，發生提存風潮，各銀行人山人海，支取者頗爲擁擠，而大部份均爲零星存戶，每人支取僅數十元或一百元者。據所得報吿，較大之銀行，三日中，每日支付現鈔總數在十萬及數十萬元，不少亦有付達百萬元者。希望本市各界對於財部馬電眞相，向大衆加以解釋，勿要聽信謠言，中奸人之計，而使全市金融，發生動搖。並且在此奇熱暑天，各存戶若無急用，不要至銀行支取現鈔，收藏家中，一則，免市面現鈔奇缺，而使金融發生不安，二則，須知謾藏誨盜之風險。本市銀錢業對於小額存款，決不停止支付，大衆持以鎮靜，免上投機者及奸人之當。試觀近日外滙暗市之轉鬆，與金市之轉跌，可證謠言不足信。（英君）</p>
<p>編者按：爲了外銀行不受財部的命令拘束，對於中外存戶現鈔如額照付，相形之下，更打動一般有資金者向外逃避的心理，這大是可慮！</p>
<h3>紗花　現紗暗盤昨已做開　售價比節前多傾跌付款手續尙未議妥</h3>
<p>自財政部馬電到滬、銀錢業各行莊一體遵行後、市塲趨勢、大爲安謐、現紗市塲已停市兩日、今則現貨到會探聽消息者頗不乏人、集會者雖較平時爲稀、然客帮亦來會略行採辦、暗盤交易已做開、人心高低不一、啻論紛紜、莫裏一是、由廣帮靈南帮購買二十支·十支粗細紗一二百包、市價二十支特金城始做五百零五元、雙地球價爲四百五十五元半、二十支牧羊三百九十元、比端節前之價跌十餘元、成交幾十包、一霎間某號賣出三叫十包、愛地球比開價忽跌十五元、爲四百四十元、牧羊亦跌十元、爲三百八十元、特金城爲四百九十五元、二十支雙馬廣　還價爲四百七十元、買方意堅未能妥協、至十一時二十支變馬多喊四百八十元、有人要買、亦未成就、午後人氣稍振、又有利多空氣、二十支牧羊又昂、做到三百九十二元、雙地球做到四百五十五元、二十支　駡爲四百九十二元、成交七八十包、須待星期一再決雌雄、以上做就之交易都係照舊規、絕無更動、聞華廠以前向例售出三七計算三成劃頭、七成匯劃、現將劃頭升一成、均改全劃頭出貨、此項尙未決定、其中情形依然複雜、前途問題多端、又有人說、大槪以照老辦法、但自以後華廠售貨辦法恐改全劃頭、午後紗業公會亦召集同業會議、大概對於日紗買賣之手續、及付款問題也、</p>
<h3>舶掉風吹散黃梅雨　戽水挿秧……農民受殃</h3>
<p>入　就是　江下游的雨季，中國向來以雨季的來臨，調為芒種節之後的丙日。有人說，仍免不了五行生尅之說；其實現在高喊破除迷信的人們，簡直不明白何者是迷信，何者不是迷信了。中國雖用的是陰　，而一年二十四節氣，實際上恰是跟陽暦走的，所以芒種夏至節的前後，常是雨季；可是雨季最怕是吹的西南風，西南風一起，雨氣戲把他消滅了。民國二十三的大旱，正爲霉令早吹了西南風緣故。</p>
<p>西南風在舊時行海的人稱爲舶掉風。當歐亞用帆船來往的時候，那時全靠風向；西南風一吹，洋船就可開來中國海岸；爲的是船向東北行，一定要仗西南風助力。</p>
<p>中國有句老農諺，「夏至西南漫小橋」，言夏至日有西南風，將來雨水必多「漫小橋」正言其水漲之甚。這也許爲是夏至正當霉令雨季，當雨不雨，過了頭仍舊要雨的，一定有相常應騐，故能流傳到今朝。</p>
<p>「錯過黃梅弗種田」，種田挿秧需要水，故應趁黃梅雨季去蒔秧，等到過了黃梅，一則種田已遲了，二則需要戽水種田，那不是雙重損失麼？但是黃梅無雨，高田常要戽水種秧，農夫大受其殃。然亦並不是黃梅無雨，即爲旱災，災不災，尙要看此後的天氣，何况「旱災一條綫，水災一大片，」所以黃梅時節的晴燥，苦了農民多費些力氣是眞的，與目前的民食是無甚關係。（中）</p>
<h3>英政府訂購美棉　值六百萬金鎊與八萬噸橡皮交換</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、昨日殊爲俏　、同業均以農業救濟金案之通過、故羣起購買、利物浦及孟買來電良好、引起南方現貨價格更為堅定、同時英美以棉花橡皮為戰時重要原料、英政府願向美購買六百萬金鎊之美棉、將以英產之八萬噸橡皮交換之、依照二國之意、如將來世界並無戰爭、雙方均願將此項易得之品、藏貯七年云、該項合同已於昨日在英簽訂、故各方殊為與舊、結果紐約棉市上漲十四五磅音、印度連同預測小一羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因洋行付款尙無覓得適當辦法、各方甚形混亂、且日來到貨日擠、而堆貨之碼頭、實因存貨過多、管理者以事繁而疏忽、故碼頭時有火災時生、殊使各方之焦慮也、廠方及同業日來均召開會議、共商善策、諒於日內定有解決之法、</p>
<p>停滯兩日之棉市昨因紗價暗盤之開始、人心安定、同業中意思活動、本棉同行中做開一筆交易、火機花一百包、價爲八十八元、係現鈔棧交、蘇北一路近日來源較爲暢旺、碼頭到貨計通州花一千四百六一包、</p>
<h3>證券　外債再見新低價</h3>

<h3>五金　英鋼板市面冷落</h3>
<p>行情反增六七元</p>
<p>英鋼板市面久吿岑寂、日前因現貨充塞、故標準售盤、一度回落、但自外滙緊縮後、行情隨即飛黃騰達、惟敢近以來、天津帮因環境特殊、對該貨並無急需、烟台靑島諸帮、雖有點綴、但爲數絕微、至本街各廠家及同業等、亦無意購辦、故市况冷落、昨日成交紙數十擔而已、惟行情反較前市漲起有六七元之多、如五喱及七喱半沽二十五元、一吩售二十元、一吩半沽十九元、二吩則開十八元五角、（單位每市擔）、</p>
<h3>糧食　四戶歛跡　米價回落二三角</h3>
<p>杜粳　各帮來源、河下無到、車輪包子、則有常州南帮到貨二千餘包、采市自兩公部局令限高粳二十一元、白尖十七冗後、國戶已見絕跡、僅本街店胃稍有添購、不過因金融關係、殊鮮大宗交易、故形勢較疲、市面回低、結果厚薄粳價照眼光相別、已落二三角、杜洋尖客尖亦並降二角有奇、</p>
<p>變元　去路有限、惟因價格已與粳米接進、未肯再貶、呈平定之局、</p>
<p>客秈　昨市已經恢復常態、本街與內地己有問津、惟行情被現鈔枯乏與限價關係、已見抑落二三角、內地辦去砶米七百多包、價開十五元七八角至十五元半、本街各戶去京蕪秈一千三四百包、高十七元、中决十六元半及十六元、售開價悉在限價以內、且存底充實、全滬尙存三十萬包以上、而來源仍見絡繹不絕、後市或能逐决趨平、然據皖商消息、目下蕪價已昂、後首恐難通劃云、</p>
<h3>粉市平淡　太倉新麥六元七</h3>
<p>現粉續吿淸淡、因値週未之期、且廠槃自改爲四元路角半現鈔後、對於滙割談價、暫爲拒絕、故客帮交易、依然無形停頓、僅本街方面三五十包與一二百包之零批交易而已、市面在此環境、毫無變動、大致須待金融問題穩定後、方有正式市面云、</p>
<p>新小麥來源連日有滬寗路一帶、零星到埠、適值現鈔缺乏聲中、市面亦曾一度擯局、昨市本街方面、略有問津計開出太倉新麥二百餘包、價爲六元七角、熱烈市面、恐尙須有待云、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白回鬆</h3>

<h3>疋頭　夏貨呢料　銷路一斑</h3>
<p>夏貨呢絨、日來市銷零多整少、一因實銷有限、隨出隨進、二因外匯劇縮、賣價欲漲、三因客需已停、單靠本街、</p>
<p>派立斯　門莊帮華服剪銷、較之西服帮爲廣、標準行市初因漲、後因國貨洪盛寅豐有出品、香港被扣之東貨、續有裝到、市勢見平、近來賣方欲漲價買方謂實銷已過去、又成搜持之局、</p>
<p>羽紗呢　今夏以條子爲最暢銷、小格子决之、素色出路較呆、西貨目下大半已多售完、怡和申織品、大路西裝走銷頗盛、因每碼祇售五兀餘、致極形普及云、</p>
<p>萬立頂　新近風行特甚、米色與常靑格外暢銷、英製者市貨多見斷檔、標準先後會躍漲半元餘、國貨無出品、東貨質薄且含人造毛、買方少用、</p>
<p>巴勒呢與胖別取　市銷皆暢、然以時新條子爲俏活、素色需銷較鈍、行情因之互有堅疲、大半均視花樣爲轉移、越高檔好貨走銷越見迅繁、</p>
<p>白嗶嘰白直貢　白嗶嘰走銷暢活、英掣者缺乏俏貴、東貨充斥未能上升、白直貢趨勢較白嗶嘰爲佳、英製者大半齊須沽十元以上、永興宏康申織者、多下檔而有小辮子、致未能代替銷出、</p>
<p>紗蔴膠布　蔴膠布、最初市氣頗緊而漲、後同業到來見光、兼國廠小機戶、齊有冲貨織出、致行悄步入下游、今爲滙票關係、方始復又回漲一二角、紗綫帆布東貨進口較往年减缺三分之二、貨價步漲、國貨出品暢銷甚盛、昨　輻頭號售八角半、二號售七角八分，</p>
<h3>海味　海蜇頭皮銷路盛</h3>
<p>海蜇爲冷食品、不須烹製、以愈陳而愈脆、淸潔衛生、最宜於夏、故近日銷塲頗暢、刻市兩年陳蟄皮每擔售十七元、上年貸十四元、蟄頭爲十二元五角、其勢穩健、</p>
<h3>藥材　金銀花當令淡銷</h3>
<p>金銀花宣通氣血、消散　疽外症中推爲聖藥、時常夏節、正届銷令、刻查市上陳貨尙厚、新貨近由渝帮運到七八件、嗣爲走銷不甚熱閙、故近日售盤、祇開每市担爲六十元、</p>

<h3>活潑金融調劑市面　請儘量供給法幣　銀錢業電部飭四行照辦　各業紛盼另訂補充辦法</h3>
<p>財政部馬電限制支付存款辦法後、銀錢兩業公會除遵辦外、昨電部請飭四行儘量供給法幣、昨又奉部漾電、解釋限制辦法適用上海一埠、各業仍盼另訂補救辦法、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>財部另有　漾電到滬</p>
<p>中中交三銀行奉財政部馬電（二十二日）後、即通知銀錢兩業公會遵辦、上海市商會及銀錢兩業公會、於昨日奉財政部漾電、內容與馬電略同、惟規定此項限制辦法、適用於上海一埠、至於上海以外各埠、仍照廿六年八月十六日部頒安定金融辦法及八月十七日部批安定金融補充辦法辦理、即每週提取存款數目爲百分之五、但最高額每週不得超過一百五十元、</p>
<p>電部儘量　供給法幣</p>
<p>上海銀錢兩業公會、除通吿遵辦外、並會同決定七項應付辦法、今各銀行錢莊均已照辦、該兩公會爲調整市塲法幣頭寸起見、已於昨日由兩公會聯）名電財政部、要求中·中·交·農四行、儘量供給同業法幣、以利各萊交易、而免金融呆滯、聞財政部方面、對銀錢業之請求、允對正當之需要法幣、繼續儘量供給、</p>
<p>各業請求　補救辦法</p>
<p>上海各業、鑒於財政部限制提要辦法、實爲安定滬金融唯一之耍策、均表示一致奉行、貫澈政府之戰時金融政策、惟各業因購買原料正當用途、需要法幣、盼望財政部另訂補充辦法、以便繼續生產而維勞工生計、聞已有某某等業函請市商會要求電部肆議、望當局體恤商艱、迅頒補救辦法、</p>
<p>市塲穩定　投機减少</p>
<p>金融市塲自馬電漾電先後到滬後、人心已安、謠言平息、銀行提存、反較前减少、一切投機事業、如現金·棉紗·雜糧·麵粉·豆米·證券·外匯·等、因現鈔頭寸缺乏、成交數目大减、市塲轉趨穩定、各種物價、因無投機之操縱、預料不久或可回降、有益市民生計、此實財政部馬電所賜、至於匯刻貼水率、今已有正式行市、</p>
<h3>限制提存　與貼現難並立　旣可貼現卽無所謂限制　聞蘭亭氏評論貼現制度</h3>
<p>銀錢業應謀根絕方法</p>
<p>本報肥者昨以事訪問聞蘭亭氏、曾論及最近財政部馬電限制提存的問題、聞氏以十二分的熱烈情緒、表露出他含蓄了相當時間、不吐不快的神情說道、在這個時候、發國難財的不知多少、財政部馬電</p>
<p>限制提存</p>
<p>爲的是有人購買外滙、所以這個限制辦法、用意甚善、可是上海市上依舊有所謂貼現、他個人以爲旣然限制、就不能貼現、旣可貼現、就無限制、他繼續說、貼現的用途、可以說大部分用以購買外滙的投機、一方要杜絕外滙投機、而一方又可以貼現、所以對取締投機、是勢難收效的、或者可以說因爲貼現才爲這般投機者開</p>
<p>操縱之門</p>
<p>現在政府規定、國家需要·慈善事業·發放工資、都不在限制提存之列、那末所謂貼現、有何必耍、他相信貼現存在一日、外滙投機、即一日無法根絕、如果市上無所謂貼現、物價自然趨平、人民生活當可安定、這個重大的金融問題、爲國家經濟所關、</p>
<p>民族命脈</p>
<p>所繫、殊應早謀澈底辦法、聞氏目擊事實、心有未安、所以很希望金融界·銀錢業·和全體市民、都能認識大我、犧牲小我、爲整個金融謀根本安定之方云云、</p>

<p>按照限價　互相買賣</p>
<p>米市塲昨晨九時照常開市、自經荳米公會佈吿、齣後市塲交易皆須遵照規定限價交易、故昨晨市塲米價、遂趨回跌、中决各米、亦均下跌至限價、人心已趨安定秩序漸見好轉、兩租界當局之米糧管理委員會、已定於二十七日（星期二）召開會議、聞屆時將討論（一）穩定米價、各米商必須依照規定限價交易、（二）竭力疏通國米來源、</p>

<h3>日軍又强行登陸　定海現有戰事　普陀山等處日曾數度登陸與浙東整個防務毫無影響</h3>
<p>日軍在定海登陸消息甚引起旅滬浙人之注意、惟僅見日方宜傳、滬上並未接到定海直接電報、兼之滬定現方斷航、故情形更爲間隔、惟上海某輪公司上海辦事處、於前日午後五時、會接發自輪上之電報、因該輪係行駛定海寗波間者、電文內曾涉及定海有戰事一語、該輪昨晨自甬駛定、於抵瀝港洋面時、即逕開石浦、中止開定、由此推想、定海情形、似欠安靜也惟定海係集島成治、陸路不通浙東、故即使發生變化、亦無足重視、</p>
<p>日方宣傳　登陸消息</p>
<p>自日海軍當局於昨晨發表、日海軍陸戰隊於二十三日晨、在舟山羣島强行登陸後、新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、舟山羣島（即定海縣）爲浙東寗波鎭海口外之海島、包括岱山·普陀·衢山·定海·等島、四岸臨海、在軍事上無關緊要、戰後並無駐軍、僅由人民自衛團及縣府警察維持秩序、普陀山等日海軍曾數度登陸、旋即自動撤退、今岱山及衢山於上月間、即爲日海軍賀尹作部隊佔領、惟時遭中國游擊隊之襲擊、因此日海軍司令之辦公處、現已移至兵艦上、該山之一維持會」會長費公宰、已於本月二十日、爲游擊隊擊斃、</p>
<p>高登輪電　現有戰事</p>
<p>至於定海因爲縣政府之所在地、有德商魯麟洋行之高登輪、行駛寗波定海間、商業較縣屬其他各地爲繁盛、定海旅滬同鄕會昨曾電定海縣政府詢問眞相、因無綫電中斷、致無法通音、但行駛甬定之高登輪、昨曾有電到滬、謂定海現有戰事、則可證實登陸之日海軍、已遭當局民團及警察之猛烈抵抗、但因定海係一海島、日軍雖已登陸、與浙東整個防務、毫無影響、</p>
<p>甬定航行　暫行停頓</p>
<p>行駛寗波定海間之外輪、爲德商魯麟洋行之高登輪、及德商施毅德洋行之天寳輪、今高登輪由甬向滬報吿、謂定海有戰事、但航行是吾已斷絕、並未提及、據航業界觀察、如果定海已有戰事、則定甬錢及定海沈家門錢、以及由定海通石浦寗海等錢、無論輪船帆船、勢必完全暫行停航、至於行駛滬定之哈納輪、早已改駛溫州、</p>
<p>滬溫滬甬　照常開駛</p>
<p>關於上海寗波綫及溫州上海綫之行、並未定海事件之影響、各外商輪船公司照常派輪行駛、意商中意公司之德平輪、已於昨晨四時、由滬裝貨駛甬、當晚五時安抵寗波、意商義華洋行之寳利輪、及德商魯麟洋行之飛康輪、均定明日結關、後日由滬駛溫州、除裝載貨物外，並發售客票、惟須當地殷實保人、</p>
<h3>滬山間航輪　照常開行</h3>
<p>據大通社記者向航業界探悉上海與汕頭航路、並未阻斷、各外輪仍照常開行、如怡和洋行之大順輪、已定二十六（下星期一）日自滬開汕頭、</p>
<h3>高級郵員　續有調動</h3>
<p>副郵務長調渝</p>
<p>上海郵政管理局最近調動大批高級郵員、分赴川滇黔各地、已吿首途村、有押運組長陳聲揚·機工監事組長卞千仭·外洋包裏組長梁紹楝等、茲悉署副郵務長運輸股長史詒堂、亦於日前奉命調渝、聞史君爲上海高級郵昌中最具才幹者、此决奉調、滬局同人、深表惋惜、</p>

<h3>英教士來滬　述日軍搜檢事　親身經歷備遭無禮待遇最受打擊者為中國苦力</h3>
<p>字林報云、英國某敎士、（不便舉其名）星期二日自天津來滬、據談、英人入天津租界、以經萬國橋者爲最多、因無需竚立長行華人苦力之後、鵠候准許入內也、渠於本月十六日晨由平抵津、僅携一小皮包、內置睡衣與襯衫等物、日哨兵聞渠係英人、乃導之入檢查小舍、小皮包中各物、先被傾出檢查、一便衣日軍官索閱護照、並加盤詰、旋命去衣、渠</p>
<p>乃禠襯衫</p>
<p>與襪履、但若不准其入鄰室、則拒不褫褌、日人知渠非圖掩匿何物、乃未經令去禈旋將其衣履及袋中紙張詳加檢查渠若不鎭靜如恒、當已發生事端矣、據渠之意、日軍官僅向英人施行此等敵對行動、乃圖激起被查英人之憤怒、若加抗拒、則以抗拒軍官爲言、而施逮捕、查畢、其皮包中諸物</p>
<p>被擲於地</p>
<p>渠拾起襯衫、而圖拂去塵垢時、便衣日軍官竟揮拳擊其肩、日哨兵亦持上槍刺之步槍逼近、渠不欲與之惹起事端、乃不復行動、旋有另一日軍官到塲操英語詢明後即助渠整理皮包、並代致歉意、一小時後、始得入租界、星期一日</p>
<p>渠離租界</p>
<p>復遭相同之檢查、記者詢華人不欲入租界之說確吾、據稱麕集各入口處欲入租界之華人甚夥、而以苦力居多、但每二十分鐘、僅有四人准許入內、故最受封鎖之打擊者、即屬此等苦力、因彼等不能入租界工作、即不得一日之糧也、兩苦力不耐久待、圖</p>
<p>泅水過河</p>
<p>而人、但均被逮捕、租界中牛乳消耗雖巨、但每日僅少數送牛乳之俄人准許入內、蔬菜絕對缺乏、渠離津之日、外僑已無肉可食、因封鎖前運入之肉類無足量之冰貯藏、故信食之不適衛生也、</p>

<h3>李律師與林立珍　通姦案續審記　時期問題成為爭執焦點髮妻請賠償損害金一元</h3>
<p>律師李　（又名李樹德）、自與其妻沈綺文反目、迫令歸寗之後、遂與情人王立明（本名林立珍）姘居天遼路五百四十六弄六十五號屋內之擱樓上、雖居處爲蓬門圭賽、上下須用活動竹梯、但以生活甜蜜、反覺甚樂、惜乎好事不常、近經沈氏訪知、乃投該管匯司捕房吿發、本月一日黎明、中西探員奉派按址</p>
<p>馳往捉姦</p>
<p>當將一對野　鴦從擱樓中拘入捕房、偵訊之下、仍令歸去、一面向第一特區地方法院對李林提起通姦公訴、業已一度傳審、各情曾誌前報、昨晨又由方慶還推事開庭傳集兩造人證繼續訊究、被吿林立珍（即王立明）裝飾入時、與李　並肩亭亭玉立、面無病容、當係厥疾已痊矣據該婦供、今年二十五歲嘗爲</p>
<p>家庭教師</p>
<p>與李　相識已三年，同居亦有兩載、初實不知李已有妻、庭上乃轉訊沈綺文、去年七月在間丁香花園所遇、李携手偕遊之女性、是吾爲林、而沈氏則答曰、吾、並稱與李之信內所云、李有外遇、並非指林婦、當時雖聞李有盧林兩女友相往來、但因未獲確證、故不能行使吿訴權、絕非縱容或宥恕云云、旣復訊</p>
<p>據林婦供</p>
<p>稱、與李同居之後、偶於途中遇沈氏、始據李言、伊人即係其妻、因彼此不睦、且其妻已出居母家、不再干涉渠之行動、我則因同居已久、雖　催李舉行婚禮、奈其每每藉故推延、故亦無可如何等語、嗣由李所舉證人朱長林到庭作證、謂去年七月二十以前、彼在丁香花園遇李林同行、旋見原吿亦至、彼此甚注意、當</p>

<p>目的端在金錢、觀彼前於調停時所提條件爲繼續分居、由李給予國幣一萬元、及此後每月生活費數百元等項、自可明瞭用意之所在也、而林婦亦延吳正矱律師辯護一過、最後沈氏之律師乃對兩被吿提起附帶民訴、請求判令兩被吿共同賠償損害金國幣一元、但兩被告對此一元之損失、均當庭表示不能負祖、旋出庭上論候宣判</p>

<h3>怎樣過暑假？</h3>
<p>— 奮飛</p>
<p>趕快打定暑期工作計劃</p>
<p>暑假快要到了！我們在這兩個月的假期以內，打算怎樣？如何可以使時間不是虛擲過去？那末，我想：或許諾位早已立下工作計劃吧！大凡在這個暑假裏頭，必定有着許多已經畢業或升級或就業的小朋友，各人預備自己「應做的工作，可是，在這許多小朋友中，說不定也有一小部分的小朋友，貪玩——整天的遊戲，這常然是孩子天性的特微，我因爲諸位犯有上述情事，便趁今天的機會，向諸位提出「怎樣過暑假」？</p>
<p>第一「充實智識」；你們辛苦了一年，試問究竟得到了些什麽智識？雖然在成續報吿單上已有證明了，但是你是不是充實？換句話說，就是這些成續是不是自己的本領，畢業的小友，朋固然快活，然而你在暑期中，應該仍加緊努力，非但不要忘記以前所學得的智識，並且還有充分的智識，才可投考中學，如果一旦忽略，把光陰虛擲，學業便似「舟行逆水」，「不進則退」。夏天雖熱，早晚必凉，正可利用時間，把舊時所學得的智識重行慢慢地研究一下，所謂一溫故而知新」。允其一般未畢業，未升級的小朋友，更要努力不可，吾則，你們到明年還是一留級」，現在我願你們不必害羞，不必胆怯，只要肯用心，前送還是有希望的。第二修養道德」；你們在學校裹，或者因爲師長的嚴厲，不敢犯校規，等到一出校門，便似野馬一般自由，允其整天在家庭中遊戲，很可以碰到「頑皮的孩子」，古人云，「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」的確可以引誘你走上「歧途」，這是很危險的呀！所以我們雖然離開了學校，依然遵守校規，切勿可「頑皮」成性，做父母的，應該注意自己的兒女，品行如何？非要嚴厲不可，放任就成「溺愛」。的最大的惡果。一般就業的小朋友，自己的品行，絕對不可放任，須記住「一失足成千古恨」的敎調。第三「保衛身體」；你們在學校裏，時常有淸潔檢查，所以一定很注意衛生，如果一旦出了校門，說不定要忽視了，允其在上海的地方，鴿室蝸居，更在這夏天的時候，夏令衛生格外要注意，否則疾病很容易發生，一個人生了病，當然苦惱，或者遇到傳染病，便可以波及到全家的人，甚至有生命的危險。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友！你門一定早已立下一張工作計劃表了，上面不過是一個大槪的情形，有許多細目還待你們自己去定吧！同時，希望你們對於「智德體」三方面，在兩個月的暑期內不要懈怠忽視，方不負師長的敎訓。</p>
<p>（註）溫習功課可以依照平日的「課程表」按着重複溫習。</p>
<h3>爲什麽要發生衝突</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>在小朋友中間，時常爲了一件小事，就不相和睦，卽使是很好的朋友，也彼此不肯讓，甚至相駡相打，有時家長們爲了疼愛兒女的緣故，引起成人們的反臉，可是不一會兒小孩于又和好如初了，像這種反復的事情，一天中不知要發生幾次，這又是小朋友們的缺點，應當快些改過的。我現在把小朋友們衝突的原因，略講幾點於下，你們細細想一想，這些話對不對。</p>
<p>一·爲了小我的利益……什麼呌做小我的利益，就是只顧自己的私利，而不管公衆的利害的，這一點可以說是主要的原因。你們時常有了他人和自己意見不同，因此大家不快樂的分散，例如有許多同伴相處，預備做一種遊戲，而各人不肯容納他人的意思，就玩不成了；而每人還不以爲自己固執，只是責備人；還有在利害衝突時，叉要反臉了。這都因爲太自私自利的緣故。</p>
<p>二·搬弄是非的害處，……有些小朋友，喜歡把他人講的話畫蛇的添足的，說給他要好的同伴聽，才以爲自己對朋友已盡了責，而不知在同學間又增加了糾粉和怨恨。</p>
<p>三·缺乏原諒的心……他人或者不故意的傷犯了你，你却變本加厲的責備他，例如某同學不留心踏痛你的脚，他已請過原諒，而你駡他打他，直到他哭了才算得到勝利。這種小朋友最易被人看輕。</p>
<p>我想小朋友們一定知道人是不能脫離團體而生活的，允其在他們中間接觸的機會更多，如果時時只爲自己打算，那麼衝突的機會愈多，久之他們都不喜和你作伴了，那時你孤零零一人，好不寂寞，有何樂趣。反之，肯犧牲自己，盡力帮助他人，而和藹可親，這時你的朋友一定很多，不但精神上獲得愉快，學業也能日日向上。小朋友們，你們羨慕那一種人，只要你們時時留心减少衝突的原因，那麼你們以後的團體也是和睦的，快樂的，互助的。</p>
<h3>給小朋友們的禮物</h3>
<p>— 來</p>
<p>給小朋友們的禮物　來－本市護畜會贈送福幼報動物專號三千冊</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！你們知道上海有一個「護畜會」嗎！它的宗旨就是要我們大家來愛護家畜；不要讓它們受飢餓和寒冷，更不許它們受虐待，因爲我們知道狗兒，貓兒，鴿子等，不但爲我們服務，而且也是我們的良伴。在必要的時候，他們也願爲我們犧牲它們的生命哩！記得有一個外國朋友告訴我一件事實：在某年冬天，他和他的朋友駕了一輪五隻狗兄拖的雪車去旅行，不料半路遇到了一隻狼，雖然他們拚命的趕着雪車逃命，可是終不及那狼來得快。當那狼快要迫近他們的一剎那，突然有二隻狗跳了出去和狼搏鬥，其餘的三隻依然拉着雪車向前奔跑，結果，那二隻義狗竟毅然地爲它們的主人犧牲了。又如普法戰爭時，法國有一隻軍用鴿在千鈞一髮的境遇中救出了幾百名法軍。像這樣的故事眞是多得很呢！</p>
<p>就是在前年淞滬戰事爆發的常兒，有一位匈牙利的小朋友，忽忽地跟他的父母逃出了楊樹浦，後來發覺在他的家裏遠有三個好朋友沒有出來。那三個好朋友就是他所愛的一隻狗，一隻公鷄，和一隻芙蓉鳥，爲了他不忍使它們在那邊活活的餓死，就不顧一切的從浦東波江到楊樹浦去，自然在途中遭遇了許多不測的危險，但是終於帶了他的三位好朋友脫難了戰區。後來上海的「護畜會」（馬霍路一八西號）知道了這事，就報吿給美國的總會和英國的分會，他們就贈他一塊金牌和一塊銀章來獎勵這位小英雄。</p>
<p>上海的「護畜會」因爲耍提倡愛護家畜的緣故，特地借「廣學會二福幼報出版動物專號一期，預備分送給各位小朋友。內容有「一封請願書」，「皇帝的夜鶯」，「忠心的小黃」，「變戲法」…等，當你們看到了這個好消息之後，請快去吿訴你們的同學們，並且請你們的校長寫信到上海博物院路一二八號廣學會」福幼報社索取。</p>
<h3>烽火裏的兩隻小驚鴻</h3>

<h3>畢業的典禮（上）</h3>
<p>— 老杜</p>
<p>這天，我們的學校裏舉行一個盛大的畢業典禮，成千成萬的人在禮拜堂前擁擠。我費了不少的力，總算也被他們軋進去，想找一個在中央的坐位，可是事實上早被聽衆們佔去了。我更擠向前去，東找西尋的去注意着那裏有空的坐位，在很前的二三排，好容易的被我找到了一個。</p>
<p>這裏有一個女孩讓一些空位給我，更睜大了褐色的眼珠瞧着我。伊的臉龐好似在晨曦下的玫瑰一般的豔麗。漸漸地我也發覺自己的視綫射在伊的臉上可是每一决都和伊活靈而微笑的眼光接觸了。這女孩似乎有意和我做一個朋友。伊帶着伶俐的笑容送還我那掉在地下的手帕，我很感激的謝了伊一聲，這一聲兩方認爲最適當的介紹了。這時另有一人擠下來坐在我旁邊，這倒使我更和伊接近了一些，因此我們立刻就很相熟了。</p>
<p>「這裏擠得很」！伊對我說。</p>
<p>「不錯」，我回答着，「每個人都喜歡看看學生進入社會的最後一個階段」。伊的臉微笑着，父很驕傲的說道：「我的哥哥今天要畢業了，他還要上台去演說，因此我幣來了這個花球，預備在他演說完了的時候拋上去」這花不是花房裏的珍品，是家庭裏很普通的供花，正像我們俘着老祖母一個樣兒。「可是」，我想：「這花雖是普通的，而伊哥哥一定是喜歡的，因爲道是他妹妹送的緣故」。</p>
<p>「那是我的哥哥」。伊凝視着花球而這樣的說着。</p>
<p>「是不是有淺色頭髮的那一個」？我問道。</p>
<p>「不」，伊微笑的搖着頭，似乎是無意的責備我。「不是那個生得平常的。他是很漂亮咖啡色而有波紋的頭髮，眼珠瞧上去是棕色的，其實是深棕色的。在那邊，他的手高舉着，你瞧到了沒有」？</p>
<p>伊很急切的從我瞧着他，叉從他瞧着我，似乎極力的要使我瞧見那個是伊的哥哥。</p>
<p>「瞧見了」，我說。「他是一僩挺漂亮的哥哥」。</p>
<p>「是的，他是很美麗的」，伊欣喜得很坦白的說着：「他是這樣的良好，又是這樣的用功！當我媽媽死後，他便當心着我。他現在雖不是一個代表臨別贈言的人，但他在一級中已得了榮譽」。</p>
<p>我想伊對於這學校是很親密，而允其關心伊哥哥的讀書，希望和成功。</p>
<h3>小朋友的馬路安全運動</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>小朋友們！公共租界和法租界自六月十八日起舉行馬路安全運動週。的確，上海這都市之中，自汽車數量增多而後，肇禍案件也因而逐年增加。允其是租界人口激增之後，汽車下面的枉死鬼，也開了空前未有的新紀錄。爲的在肇禍案件中，死傷的兒童，數字也不少，所以小朋友們對於馬路安全運動一問題，也應相當的注意。</p>
<p>小朋友們的馬路安全，我們當然希望一般小學敎師，在上課時，隨時利用機會，灌注一些有關馬路安全的常識，使一般的小朋友都知道行路耍當心，對於各種交通規則也都能熟悉。但另一面却要小朋友們自己隨時注意馬路安全，這樣在行路時才不致遇到危險。</p>
<p>凡是十歲以下的小朋友，切不可單獨在馬路上行走，出去應田家長或大人陪着走，關於這點，做家長的當然也要特別注意。放了學出來，在馬路上同學互相戲逐，很易肇禍，至於在馬路上溜冰，學騎自由車，那更是危險。這些惡習，是絕對不應當沾染的。</p>
<p>關於馬路交通規則，每一個小朋友是應得知道的。走路靠左邊走，要走在兩旁的行人道上，中叫是車馬的過道；穿馬路格外要留心：有交通燈的地方，開綠燈才可過去，紅燈是不能走的；另有一種自動交通燈，有三種燈色，除了紅綠燈之外，更有黃燈，是表示燈色將要改換，一見黃燈。也不能穿過去；沒有交通燈的地方，巡捕舉了手欄着，就是不能過去的指示；汽車上面，轉灣的時候，有的裝有自動指針，有的由開車的人做手勢，無論是指針或手勢，向那一面指，就是表示車子耍向那一面轉灣；這些是大家應得知道的。</p>
<p>小朋友最容易聽人的指示，知道了十九會照法做去。但對於馬路安全的種種常識，小朋友們不但自己知道了就算，還要負責向人宜傳和轉述。家裏的人如果不大明瞭以及內地來的親友對於上海的交通規則完全不知道，那就在小朋友們能够吿訴他們。這樣不但目己行路可以安全，連得別人行路，也因你們的轉述而得以安全。好吧，在這馬路安全運動週內，我們深望所有上海的小朋友對行走安全能够格外注意，從事宣傳。</p>

<h3>夏季的自然界</h3>
<p>— 李毓鏞</p>
<p>在夏季，寒暑表的水銀懶洋洋地伸着身體，除非到了很凉快的時候，懶得一動都不肯動。</p>
<p>早上起來，如果到草地上走一趟，鞋上便被草葉上的露水弄濕了。那些翅膀被露水弄濕的粉蝶，一直到八九點鐘才飛出來，這時候，討厭的蒼蠅也出來了。傍晚，只聽見蚊子嗡嗡作聲：在電燈光下，還看見許多小燈蛾，浮塵子等在飛擾着；於是許多人用大蒜掛起來，使它們不會飛近。可是關了電燈，臭蟲便出來咬人了。</p>
<p>如果在更熱的時候，還可以聽見知了的呌聲，從沿街那些法國梧桐的濃蔭裏傳出來，池邊有許多蜻蜓在飛翔着，有時候飛近水面，連串地產下許多卵子，在鄕間，傍晚一到，滿野螻蛄的呌聲，被人誤作蚯蚓，蝙蝠在暗中拍拍拍的捉着蚊，蛾，螢蟲點着燈範在草叢間飛着。</p>
<p>有時候碰到氣候轉變，我們還可以看到更多的小動物。差不多要下雨了，蜘蛛就不再做精緻的網，成羣的蜻蜓和幾隻孤獨的馬大頭就在這時候飛、出來。等到大雨過了，蝸牛在牆上爬着，蚯蚓從滿水的洞裏逃出來，害病死了。</p>
<p>在郊外，這時候正是野花盛開的季節。如果我們稍稍留意，便可以知道它們的花早上在什麼時候開，晚上在什麼時候開，都有一定的。所以有人把它們照開花時間的遲早排成一個「鮮花錶」。只是我們在孤島上面，好久沒有看見野花了，好玩的「鮮花錶」，等着勝利以後再做吧。</p>
<h3>畜生道中（六）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>諾克斯受了這傷害之後，心裏憤憤不平，口中喃喃有詞的，足足有半小時之久，它也不知道是那一個傷害它的。不多一會，它却漸漸地睡熱了，夢中瞧見了它的仇人，便向着他在吠不休。</p>
<p>彭共旣把諾克斯刺了一下，就溜出去和勒夫一塊兒玩耍了。他取了一枝手杖，向它拋去；勒夫不敢怠慢，連忙用牙齒來接住了。彭其走過去，握住了手杖的一頭，用力地打着旋子，勒夫的身子，也就跟着着它旋轉這玩意它原是弄慣了的。但是這一回它那牙齒的力量以乎减少了勁兒，旋到第五决時，就和那手杖脫雛了關係，這是他先前所不曾有過的。</p>
<p>勒夫一看彭其的眼睛，霍霍地射出兩道兇光，料知這一回定要矣丁了，於是一赫一個廻旋，沒命的逃開去了。彭其追了一程，追不到它，却撞見了小湯，正在追趕一頭蘇格蘭獵狐狗，一面追，一面拋着石塊。彭其以爲這是一個好玩意，立時加入了他的陣綫，一塊大石頭拗過去時，恰恰不偏不倚的打中了那狗的頭立時結果了它的性命。</p>
<p>這夜隣家便失去了一頭挺好的獵狐狗，而河面上又多了一具狗尸。</p>
<p>彭其上牀去睡覺時，轉側了好一會，竟不能睡熟。他追悔剛才不該把那狗拋到河中去，這一回事恐怕又要多出麻煩事來了。記得從前爲了古特門先生的一頭捲毛獵狗，曾挨了一頓打，後來爲了德白爾太太的貓，又險些挨打，幸而推在勒夫身上，寃枉受了責罰，但是這罪惡却明明是他犯的。他料知諾克斯今天雖給他刺了一下，但是沒有什麽大不了事，明天一淸早太陽上升的時候，包管它又要到河邊去幹它的慈善工作了。只要一給它銜起了這明獵狐狗的尸體，不用說叉有許多麻煩够他扳受哩。彭其一向有自知之明，早上是萬萬不會起早的；倒不如趁這夜色朦朧之下，悄悄地溜到河邊去，拿一柄抓草的鐵义子把那狗尸撩了起來，把它藏過或掩埋，那就沒有事了。</p>

<h3>從百物昂貴說到　一個勞工家庭</h3>
<p>— 浮雲</p>
<p>大家全靠兩手勞力合作　建立了一個美滿的家庭</p>
<p>在這物價飛漲，衣·食·住·日用品昂貴的現在，孤島居民，允其是由「八一三」砲火下，逃出來的未死者，在度着苟延殘喘的生活的時候，遇着這種難以支持的狀態，無人不喊·「日子難過！」所以，有多少已經租了房子的，因爲房租的漲價，日用品的昂貴，（雖是昔日繳一元錢一年地租的滬西一帶的茅草屋，現在租給人家，也要三五元一月的房租。）向慈善機關，請求住難民自給所，（自給所，係各人購飯自食，現救濟協會，在延平路的第二收容所，每磅白米飯，售價三分，或由難民自己購米自燒，）同時，在收容所內已經得着相當工作的難民，論其收入，可以維持一家三四人的生活，但是因爲房租担負不起，一時還不能晚離難民生活。</p>
<p>從前有人說過：「荒年餓死懶漢，」這話的確不錯，莫說是受戰事影響的今日，就是在太平時候，若是一個人，」味的偷安苟活，因循坐誤，就是有些積蓄，，長久的坐吃，終要吃的一干二凈。昔日住居戰區的，受了砲火的犧牲，家破，人亡，同住在戰區的親友，同時也家散，業失，若不自尋出路，又有誰好靠呢？筆者也是昔日住在戰區的難民，在這兩年裏，見着許多由戰區逃出，身無長物的難民，先入收容所，一家老小，度難民生活，後來自尋生路，找工作，現在都已脫離難民生活。在這許多人中，我想舉出友人余君的家庭，他們一家六人，沒一個吃閑飯的，在這六人的團結合作，各人努力各人的生產工作，雖在這生活昂貴的環境下，仍然保持美滿的家庭團聚樂趣，實是難能可貴！余君的尊翁，已過世幾年了，他老人家是吃筆墨飯的，他就自己的遭際，和經騐，感覺到吃筆墨飯的文人，所謂擱筆窮，」這種生活，是靠不住的：因此他就决定他的兒子，做工人，依自己的技能和勞力吃飯。所以余君的弟兄，都做了工人，余君是電氣匠出身，在戰前住南市，開過電料行，做過老闆。「八一三」戰事爆發，一家六人，（老母·妻·妹·弟·弟媳婦·余自己）都入了收容所，弟·兄·妻·妹·都在所內担任服務工作，去年脫離難民生活，找了一處十二元一月的房子，他家的開支，是取衆擎易舉的辦法，分配担任。他弟是銅匠，每月二十元工錢，就担任這十二元一月的戾錢。妻，和妹，是在一家布廠內做工，每月每人，有一二十元工資，每人貼家內六元的米錢。（余弟，兄，及弟媳，是不在家裹吃飯的，）弟媳是住廠做工的，每一星期回來一次，帶些燒好了的菜去，每月貼家內四元。余君自己在電料行裹做事，每月二十餘元工資，担任每日的小菜。燒飯，洗衣，一切家務，都是共同合作的。他的老母，除主理家政外，還不時代他們做針綫，他家各人穿的衣服，是毋須出裁縫工錢的。最近余君又兼一家機器廠的事，是他的朋友，拉他合辦的。這樣的一偭家庭，大家全靠兩手的勞力，做出來，分担一切費用，成了一個很美滿的家庭。由此，更可證明「團結」和「努力，是會給予我們滿意的答覆的</p>

<h3>「大地茫茫一糞翁」</h3>
<p>— 余鐵契</p>
<p>不久在報上看到一條糞翁先生將舉行書刻個人展覽會的新聞，筆者震於這位藝壇怪傑的業績，便設法探知了他的寓所，不揣冒味地跑去作一次毛遂自薦的訪晤。</p>
<p>一向曾聽到一些關於糞翁先生的奇特的性格的傅說，因此筆者當走到他家門前時，脚步反而遲疑起來，但一小時的談話的結果，證明傳說之不確。因爲糞翁先生實在不是我先前所想像的那種以怪僻的行徑來標榜一己的風格的人物，相反地，從他的誠摯，坦白和不自滿足的心理，正可以看出他處處洋溢着一個具有數十年的苦練的藝人的氣度。</p>
<p>筆者被引進糞翁先生作藝的一間屋子時，他剛正寫畢一個臨懐素草書自叙的手卷，該手卷長四丈有奇，是一幅罕見的偉構。筆酣徵飽，縱橫如意。（那個手卷也是即將開幕的糞翁個展的出品之一）。</p>
<p>糞翁先生寫後正在休息，他手裏夾着一支烟捲，額俞飄着幾絲白髮，身子斜躺在沙發上，悠然意遠地像在思索着什麼。他招待我坐下，滔滔不絕地回答我預先擬就的一串問題。據說：他自去年夏天參加杯水展覽會後，許多愛好他的書刻的人們，莫不慫恿他單獨舉行一次個展。但他因當時正在籌備開辦側簡樓金石畫法講座，忙於撰寫講義，直到今年春天才得到空閒，於是積極從事本决的個展的準備。現在決於六月二十八日起至七月二日止，假座虞洽卿路大新公司四樓連續舉行畫刻個展五天，屆時不收門券，歡迎各界人士前往參觀。統計全部出品有二百餘點，並有扇面白餘頁，而且在個展期內，定有刻印特例，石印每方八元，牙印每方十二元，這比原潤要廉得多了。</p>
<p>說起印，糞翁先生浸淫於這一門的學問，幾達三十年。他最初是沒有師承的，但曾遍臨浙派諸作，由於篆勢的謹嚴，故在雄奇中不涉於野。後來他執贄於虞山趙古泥之門，盡得其薪傳。那位趙老先生是昌碩吳先生逝後的一代大印人，自趙老先生也物故後，糞翁先生便接受了他的傳統。近年來糞翁先生更致力於兩漢官私印的摹臨，因此他的作品愈發顯出了樸茂的神韻。據說他所曾手摹的兩漢王侯印一卷，也預備在本决個展中陳列。</p>
<p>關於糞翁先生的絕藝，我只抄下黨國元老柏文蔚先生送給糞翁先生的一首詩，作本文的結束吧，那是：「漢魏精神唐宋氣，詩書金石擅兀功，古人不見江山冷，大地茫茫」「糞翁。」</p>
<h3>糞翁白蕉合作扇面</h3>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　勸學務農儲材為國　留强汰弱選種有塲</p>
<p>且說這一段趙樂大與潘佩英的戀愛佳話，凡是趙樂天的朋友，都曉得了。朱村長從前與趙樂天同過事，也算是老朋友了，當然也知道一切。在趙樂天與潘佩英結婚的時候，中日的戰事已經中定。趙樂夭父是喜歡熱鬧的，明白潘佩英是眞心愛他，得着了他戰死消息後，守貞不嫁，現在兩人還是成就良緣，所以很大大地請了一回客。許多朋友，便互相傳述，以爲佳話，而朱愛羣大槪也是聽她的叔祖朱村長所講的了。不過愛羣所知道的，恐怕沒有這樣詳細，因此作者把趙潘兩人的事，細述了一番。當時朱村長便笑着說道：『像我們那位徐村長的老當益壯，枯楊生梯，到底是舉世稀有的事。便是他自己，也覺得是出於意外吧？至於趙樂天，那又當別論，他是正在壯年呢。雖說他有一段戀愛佳話，但他還是種因於先，收果於後。因爲裏面有些離離合合的事跡，倒很有些像傳奇小說，人家便稱爲佳話。到底也不是人喜微他一條腿，選婿特爲要選取一條腿的人呀。不過現在像我那樣，也覺得很爲舒服，人要作退一步想，凡事要知足。古人說的「知足常樂」，我是很服膺這句話的。你們想：自古以來，爲了不知足，就鬧出了許多驚天勸地的事來。爲什麽有侵略者？就是一個不知足的心，侵襲了他。他那時便野心勃勃，覺得侵佔人家一些，便好一些。人家自然也不肯相讓，於是爭奪相殺之事，便起來了。所以大之國家，小之個人，也總是一樣。我們從前，爲了人家來侵略我，欺侮我，我們自然要抗拒。總算到頭來，我們這個犧牲，不是白犧牲的。保衛我們的土地，維護我們的主權，不曾損傷了分毫。我們並不要侵略人家，但是我們也不給人家侵略了去。倘然人家要來打擊我，我也老實不客氣的就要回手，道要呌做一予打擊者以打擊」。此刻我們仍舊安居樂業，回復我自由之天，做一個老百姓。我的年紀也差不多了，那個時候沒有死，只丟了一條膀子，算是徼天之幸。以後的歲月，就是我的餘生。所以我想起來，趙樂天的名字，喚作樂天，我倘然要改一個名字，應該喚作餘生咧。』（一四五）</p>
<h3>張叔通先生行書</h3>
<h3>為何須要信耶蘇？（一）因為世人都犯了罪</h3>
<p>— 吳</p>
<p>經上說：『因為世人都犯了罪，虧缺了上帝的榮耀。』又說『如今卻蒙上帝的恩典，因基督耶蘇的救贖，就白白的稱義。』在以上這二段經文中，叫我們清楚的知道，人為什麼需要相信耶蘇？並且叫我們認識，上帝是絕對公義的。他旣不欺窮，也不抱富；把全世界的人都圈在罪中，你我也都在其內。無論古今中外，男女老幼貧賤富貴，都犯了虧缺上帝榮耀的罪；因為字宙萬物都是上帝所造，我們世人的生活，動作，存留，也都在乎地。諸君！上帝賜你生命氣息…，給你享受大自然的快樂。請問：你心裏有感謝他嗎？嘴裏頌讚他嗎？著是沒有！那就是犯了罪，虧缺了上帝的榮耀·正像見女兒對待父母的不孝·悖道，那樣罪孽深重。按照上帝的律法，罪孽的報應，就是死·但上帝上忍世人滅亡，就設立赧罪的救法·就如上面一須聖經中所說的：『如今卻蔡上帝的恩典，因基督耶穌的救贖：就白白的稱義。』所以我們一身所犯的罪衍，就靠著督耶蘇十字架的救贖得蒙赦免，從罪人的地位，而遷到義人的地位，而得與上帝和好，儼然父子重逢，相紀的度亦　天的生活。（待續）　上海基督敎文字佈道會郵笛一二二十號</p>

<h3>觀毛世來等演南界關</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>毛世來二次應聘黃金戲院，比前大見進步，日前觀其辛安驟，美則美矣，未盡善也，曾爲文希望他從「狠」字上下功夫，六月二十日復觀其南界關，此戲是其所演劇中之巨擘，何也？世來惟患不能狠耳，今於此戲能「狠」矣，况又是大戲，非巨擘而何。請先述南界關故事，然後細批終身焉。</p>
<p>後周命趙匡胤侵略南唐，壽春主將劉仁瞻及夫人徐金花固守不降，劉中劍養傷，妾花迎春乘隙與參將何延錫私通，且盜令獻城降敵，城破，劉被擒，徐氏懐保幼子，轉戰入敵營，與夫相見，手刃奸夫淫婦焉。</p>
<p>世來扮徐金花，開打及巡城，蹻工出色驚人，（躍步，跑步，碎步，挫步，走圓塲，種種花樣，層出不窮，）快而且猛，把子，亮相，亦有可觀，巡城一塲唱崑曲，且唱且舞，非常吃重，惟嗓子低音尙不發達，還須用功鍊出，賞菊一塲之西皮元板，證明巳竟會唱時行調，將來唱工亦有希望。</p>
<p>此劇塲子頗緊湊，關子有精彩之處，劇本詞句亦可取，想是崑曲傳奇改編，有憲義，有價値，世來等演出賣力，可以賣錢，可以走紅，與江油關，荀灌娘同爲歷史好戲，宜多加提唱。窺奸一塲，向妾說話，忽加入京白甚多，此係創舉，蓋極好戲情，恐用韻白灣下不能全然了解，所以忽改京白歟？</p>
<p>世來此劇中，有一處關節，似乎不妥，巡城回府時，徐夫人望見敵兵將丈夫擒去，拔劍作欲鬬之狀，口中云：看劍，而敵兵不聞不問，下塲而去，夫人只得收劍入鞘，此節無結果，宜改之爲是。依卑人意思，改爲敵兵下塲，夫人拔劍追望，白口云：本當追救丈夫，一來寡不敵衆，二來幼子須得保存，回府救子，再作道理，不知可吾？</p>
<p>是日世來特別賣力，有一二處用力過猛，幾乎有失，必有人將勸其以後不要太猛，以求保險，吾不調然，此是朝氣之表現，年輕人讓他有點火氣，即使有些閃失，亦無妨礙，經騐旣多，自然穩也。若時刻要保險，則近於溫，溫則難進步矣。（以上關於毛世來）</p>
<p>高盛麟扮高懐亮，起覇，武工皆好。貫盛習扮趙匡胤，唱工白口都結實，嗓子低音稍差，沙世鑫扮劉仁瞻，稱職，二三年後，嗓子出來時，必能走紅。艾世菊扮劉延錫，有方巾丑之規模，且擅開口跳之技能，嗓子音稍低，不能響亮是一缺憾</p>
<p>最後應談坤角于素蓮扮劉妾調情之藝衛矣，于素蓮天生一位花旦材料，面雕，五官，皮膚，均稱上選，於風流勾當，捨得做，亦能做得到，嗓音雖不大，而極淸圓，是劇中扮花迎春，私的延錫臥室相會，旣見之後，假意變卦，浸漸而敬情人以酒，浸漸而相諸下塲，及徐夫人呌門，伊上塲時，淸態入妙，眞捨得做，又做得到者也。是日有目共見，予不能詳細描寫，犯綺語之戒。</p>
<p>總之，此劇有調情兩塲穿插，故人人喜看，于素蓮又能做得到，於是乎全劇生動矣。</p>
<h3>舞女聯誼社　演劇籌欵觀感</h3>
<p>— 之華</p>
<p>舞業姊妹們去年演過一個獨幕劇「舞女淚」，我是看過的。那是她鬥的集體創作，雖然缺少寫作上的經騐，然而眞實的生活却使寫作上的技術成爲决要。這是弱者的一聲呻吟，可是這呻吟却是雄壯的，這是自覺的開始。</p>
<p>今年她們又要演戲了，戲是兩個：「舞女淚」和「上海一舞女」。兩個都是獨幕劇，那大概是由於時間以及別的限制的緣故。「上海一舞女一的寫作時日，是在舞女淚」之前的好幾年，那是描述「都會的一角」中一個舞女的不幸的遭遇的，戲是一個Sketch，但這裏却向我們說明了造成舞女的社會原因之一；以我所看到的幾决演出來講，是都有很好的舞台效果的。</p>
<p>「上海一舞女」是說明了一個失去了蒙鄉的女孩子在這個社會中祇能以她的色情來錫口，而她的愛人則又因經不起高利貸的剝削而被送進了捕房；「舞女淚」雖還是一聲弱者的呻吟，然而那已是舞女自覺後的呼聲了，至於花濺淚一，則是那裏面給我們看到了丁香，她們已從自覺中有了自尊：「我們是舞女，自由職業的女性；我們是舞女，中華民國的國民」，而目，她們已淸淸楚楚的看到這般，滿天風雲！</p>
<p>這次演戲的目的是爲籌募基金，道也就是說，她們已感到集團力量的重要，「一根竹竿容易容，三根棉錢拉斷難」，允其是被侮辱與被損害的弱者，她們史須有一個集團來做她們的後盾，同時她們已是這集團中的一員，才有保障。而最重要的目的，她們要做一個「人」，做一個堂堂的人！</p>
<p>時代的巨輪誰也拉它不住，不跟着它跑，就祗好在它輪下輾死。而明年，「上海一舞女」，「舞女淚」，「花濺淚」之外也一定會更有新的關於舞女生活的劇本產生，這裏面，丁香是更多，就連米米和顧小妹，她們也會更積極起來的。她們將是鋼鐵一樣堅强中的一環。（義賣窽金）</p>

<h3>溜冰術（六二）</h3>
<p>— 蓮君琦珍合編</p>
<p>四邊（續）</p>
<p>二·第二練習法，先將一足完全用身之位置第一式，做一外進圈，閱終客足仍不落地，主足繼續用身之位置第二式，疊在第一圈之上，做第二圈，每足運做二圈，合成雙運瓊或8字形。</p>
<p>初學者覺此法非常困難，但多練必成，而所下苦功必不枉費·身之位置第一第二兩式學會後，卽須學第三第四兩式</p>
<p>第三式對於高級溜冰非常有用，如外退正搖轉之後，外進環結之前，內退反三字轉之後，或外進三字轉之前，均適用之。</p>
<p>第三式客肩客臂在前，頭向圈之中心，客腿則仍留於後。身自臀部以上，適與第一式相反。</p>
<p>第四式腰以上適與第二式相反，客臂客肩在後，客腿在前，內退三字轉之後，與外退反搖轉之後必用之。</p>
<p>此四種身之位置，如能完全明瞭，且能善爲運用，則將來自由比賽，及到高級程度時，花樣自可隨意翻新，而不覺有若何困難矣。</p>
<p>二·內進用鞋之裹邊進前，較用外邊爲稍易，因全身天然向內傾也。但一足不易持久，須先練習足灣不使內傾，而能使行動之足獨行，並須將客腿留於後，且以愈能持久爲愈佳，內進開始，腰以上身之位置，與外進開始相反，因客屬客臂先在前，待身起始旋動時，客肩輕輕移後，在後之客腿移至主腿之前，與主腿之上，（亦卽是在弧綫之上）圈終時主肩在前，客臂稍交在身前，主臂仍在後，圈終時身稍向外傾，客腿交主腿須交得透，客足使到圈綫外，如此可免成6字形。</p>
<p>內進難在開步，一般人之通病厥爲跨步太大，且足跟不易向外，最好兩足靠近，兩膝大屈，祗須着邊，並用力在足跟可矣，固母庸猛力推動也。按以上係用身之位置第一第二兩式。換足時，客肩先移前，俾全身面向前而不側。</p>
<p>第三式腰部以上，與第一式相反，主肩在前，客腿在後，內進三字轉之前，內退正搖轉之後，與外退反三字轉之後均用此式。</p>
<p>第四式腰部以上，與第二式相反，客肩客臂客腿在前，肩之動作在腰部旋動，客足在弧錢之上，如第二式，按此式實非常重要，蓋凡做以下花樣，均不能不用此式。內進反三字轉之第一弧，內退反搖轉之後，內退環結之後，故弟三第四兩式，須與第一第二兩式同樣練習也。</p>

<h3>Continuous Arrival of Chinese Reinforcements; Intense Battle Expected in Shantou; Wu Qihui Ordered to Take Command in Eastern Guangdong and Lead the Counter-Offensive; New Defensive Positions Established North of Anbu, Battles Ongoing; British Shipping Companies Ordered to Resume Hong Kong-Shantou Service</h3>
<p>Chao'an: On the 23rd, the defending Chinese forces in Shantou engaged in a fierce battle with over 400 Japanese troops at Sijiewei, driving them back to the Chenhe New Village area. As of the evening of the 23rd, they were still in a stalemate in the suburbs of Shantou, with intense fighting. Additionally, over a hundred Japanese troops attempted to land at Baopu, west of Shantou, on the evening of the 22nd, but were immediately repelled by Chinese forces. Fresh Chinese reinforcements are now arriving continuously, boosting morale. An even more intense battle for Shantou city is expected. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shaoguan dispatch: The authorities do not feel that the Japanese landing in Shantou is particularly serious. The Chinese defending forces, commanded by Hua Zhenzhong, Huang Tao, and others, are strong. At the same time, troops have been increased to defend the outskirts of Shantou and the Chao'an area. A major battle may occur in the future. There is currently fierce fighting fifteen li north of Shantou, where Japanese troops are attempting to advance along the Chao-Shan Railway, but are being fiercely attacked by Chinese forces. The railway has been destroyed, making it difficult for the Japanese to advance. Over a hundred Japanese plainclothes soldiers invading Anbu were annihilated by Chinese forces. The Chinese and Japanese armies are currently facing off at Meixi. Wu Qihui has been ordered to take command in eastern Guangdong, leading the counter-offensive and defending the territory. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, Chinese forces withdrew from Anbu, northwest of Shantou, yesterday morning. New defensive positions have been established in the northwestern suburbs of Anbu, and fighting is ongoing. It is also said that after occupying Anbu, the Japanese attempted to advance northwest, but were met with a fierce counterattack by Chinese forces and retreated. (24th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chao'an: Frontline telephone dispatch: Most of the Japanese warships have left the Shantou sea, their intentions unknown. Only five Japanese warships remain anchored at Mayukou. In the Anbu area, there are still over thirty Japanese motorboats. In the Chaoyang Da'hao area, over two hundred Japanese reinforcements landed at 3:00 AM on the 23rd to harass the area. Chinese defending forces rose to meet them, engaging in a fierce battle for four hours. The Japanese made no progress. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chao'an: After Chinese forces recaptured Anbu on the evening of the 22nd, they continued to advance south on the morning of the 23rd. The Japanese troops retreated in disarray and did not dare to attack throughout the day, but occasionally fired artillery at the Chinese forces from across the river from Anbu to show their strength. The Japanese troops who attacked Meixi, southeast of Anbu, were fiercely attacked by Chinese forces and were also unsuccessful. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chao'an: After the Japanese troops attacking Meixi were defeated by Chinese forces on the 23rd, the remaining hundred or so Japanese troops were heavily surrounded by Chinese forces and were completely annihilated on the 24th. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) British shipping companies in Hong Kong have obeyed the navy authorities' notice and are dispatching ships to resume shipping services to Shantou. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to an official announcement today, the Japanese naval authorities in Shantou have recognized the right of British ships to enter Shantou port, effective from noon today. Mail, food, and passengers can now land in Shantou, but cargo cannot be unloaded. Since the ban on ships entering and leaving Shantou, there has been widespread anxiety in Hong Kong, presenting a serious situation, as most of the fresh, perishable food needed by Hong Kong comes from Shantou. Therefore, after the announcement of this decision, concerns about food in Hong Kong have been alleviated. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese political figures here are still paying close attention to the situation in Shantou. Military figures claim that there was still fierce fighting near Shantou last night. They doubt whether the Japanese can hold the city, as the Japanese army, in view of the fierce Chinese counter-offensive, has already requested reinforcements. (24th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Newspapers here have expressed great satisfaction that Britain and the United States have rejected Japan's request not to withdraw their ships and personnel from Shantou, considering this the first sign of a strong British Far East policy. Chongqing's only English-language newspaper, the "Hankou Herald," published an editorial yesterday, declaring that the Japanese occupation of Shantou has not diminished Chinese military strength in any way, as Shantou is not militarily important. Furthermore, China's transportation with foreign countries still has more than two routes. As for the Japanese explanation that the occupation of Shantou is necessary to blockade the South China coast, it is unbelievable. First, as mentioned above, Shantou is not militarily important. If the occupation of Shantou were indeed necessary to blockade the South China coast, the Japanese would have occupied it long ago. Why wait until today? What, then, is the purpose of the Japanese attack on Shantou at this time? In a word, it is nothing more than to show that "Japan has won another victory." (24th Meitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Hankou English Chu Pao published an article yesterday, declaring that the only explanation for the Japanese landing in Shantou is that "Japanese soldiers, in view of the protracted stalemate in the war against China, are bound to cause dissatisfaction among the Japanese people, so they launched a new adventure to try to support the Japanese domestic war spirit." According to the report, this newspaper is the only English-language newspaper published in the rear of China. The views expressed often reflect the official Chinese opinion. The newspaper believes that the Japanese pretext for occupying Shantou to make the blockade of the Chinese coast effective is not sufficient, because according to this situation, the Japanese would have already occupied Shantou. It is the Japanese newspaper that publicly admits that the Japanese army lacks new vitality, and the Japanese military action will undoubtedly "end," but the ending will not be "pleasant" for the invaders.

<h3>Anti-British Movement Spreads Throughout North China; Japanese Incite Anti-British Rallies; Efforts to Involve White Russians; Semenov's Arrival in Tianjin Sparks Speculation; British People in Tianjin Repeatedly Humiliated by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources from Beiping, major cities in North China, such as Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang, held anti-British mass rallies yesterday. It is reported that this was to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the Guangzhou Incident of "1925, when a large number of Chinese students in Guangzhou were machine-gunned and killed by British troops." The mass rally in Beiping passed a resolution stating that "Britain is a disturber of China's peace and order," and that China will never achieve peace if Britain "does not change its pro-Chiang attitude and uses its concessions in North China as a base for activities that disturb peace and order." The resolution urged Britain to reconsider its attitude and "warned Britain that unless Britain clarifies its pro-Chiang attitude and agrees to cooperate with North China to build a new order in East Asia, the people of North China will continue their anti-British movement." It is reported that these resolutions have been distributed to all sectors in the form of leaflets. After the mass rally, demonstrators marched through the streets of Beiping. Furthermore, Japanese newspapers reported from Tianjin that anti-British disturbances were rampant, with demonstrators including sailors, stevedores, workers, inn servants, school teachers, and merchants. The 130,000 Muslims in Tianjin also participated in the anti-British movement. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The anti-British movement in North China has recently spread to Qingdao. Anti-British slogans have been plastered everywhere, including on buildings, the walls of the British Consulate, and shops. Chinese and White Russians are now being forced to participate in anti-British mass rallies and parades. Yesterday's mass rally even staged a parade in front of the British Consulate. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Admiralty last night, the British escort ship "Rossdorf" has been ordered from Tianjin to Beidaihe and Shanhaiguan to ensure the safety of British nationals in those areas. Furthermore, the British Consulate in Yantai requested the dispatch of a warship for protection, as anti-British demonstrations had occurred in the area and had endangered the lives and property of British people. (24th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today is the eleventh day of the blockade of the concessions. Not only have the restrictions on food and personal movement not been relaxed, but the anti-British propaganda movement has become even more intense. Newspapers, radios, wireless telegraphs, leaflets, and other methods are being widely used as tools to spread the anti-British movement. The latest development in Tianjin is the Japanese attempt to involve the White Russians in this movement. The Japanese-sponsored Yong Pao published a report stating that 300 members of the White Russian volunteer team organized by the Anti-Communist Committee under Japanese protection would assemble armed in the First Special District on Sunday afternoon and march in a parade towards the British Concession. General Iglau, the commander of the team, is said to have ordered all members to be present at the time, and those who are prevented by their employers due to work reasons must resign immediately. The most important news in the Tianjin newspapers this morning was the Reuters report from London that British Foreign Secretary Halifax had met with Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu Kui specifically regarding the incident of the humiliation of British nationals in Tianjin. The general public expressed hope that the British will now take a firm stand. This news is exciting to the White Russian community in Tianjin. Since the Tianjin blockade of the concessions, the people most affected besides the British have been the White Russian expatriates. There are over 5,000 of these people, who fled from their home country, were expelled from Manchuria, and eventually came to Tianjin, where they were able to live in peace under the protection of the British Concession. If they lose this refuge again, they will have nowhere to live. Today, a pro-Japanese Chinese small newspaper in Tianjin published a message saying that all Chinese who sympathize with the new Chinese regime should withdraw from the concessions from now on. According to sources with access to information, the ratio of Chinese allowed to enter and leave the concessions by various search offices is four to one, meaning that four Chinese must leave the concessions before one Chinese is allowed to enter. Although this ratio may not be accurate, there is no doubt that it is easier for Chinese to leave the concessions than to enter. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Director-General of the Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council, Thibaut, told an Associated Press reporter today that the hope of direct local negotiations has now been abandoned, but he believes that there is still a possibility that the blockade issue can be resolved diplomatically. Thibaut also said that the Municipal Council has always adhered to its firmly established policy of strict neutrality, and the police cooperation requested by the Japanese has always been accepted by the British side of the concession. (24th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Today, the first incident occurred in which a British military officer was prevented from entering the Japanese Concession. Although the British military authorities are unwilling to make any confirmation, reliable sources told Reuters that this morning, a British military officer in uniform, driven by a British soldier in a military vehicle, arrived at the Asahi Street entrance and exit, wanting to enter the Japanese Concession, but was refused by the Japanese, who asked him to change to a rickshaw and be searched before being allowed to pass. The officer refused and immediately turned back. Mr. Davis, a British grocer and honorary agent for New Rylands, was embarrassed by the Japanese for the third time today, standing in the crowd, waiting for inspection in the hot sun for seventy minutes. It is reported that at half past twelve this afternoon, Mr. Davis and another British man, Mr. Whiteley, who is currently the secretary of the Tianjin Country Club, wanted to enter the First Special District from the end of the Racecourse Road. The Japanese ordered the two to stand behind a group of Chinese coolies, waiting for inspection, standing for seventy minutes before they were released. People of other nationalities were released directly without any delay. When the two walked to the inspection booth, the Japanese ordered them to enter separately. Mr. Davis was searched first, and his clothes were stripped off and thoroughly examined, even his mouth was inspected, and he was ordered to squat down to show that he was not carrying anything. While the search was in progress, people from several countries passed by, including a German woman who Mr. Davis knew well. Mr. Whiteley received the same treatment, but after the Japanese finished searching him, they threw his clothes outdoors and ordered him to put them on outside. Mr. Davis told a Reuters reporter today that he had a carpet factory in the First Special District that he had to supervise himself, so he had no choice but to enter the district. It is reported that Mr. Whiteley has lived in Tianjin for twenty-six years and went to the Country Club today to work. Although the British Concession has been blockaded, many foreigners have gone to the club in recent days to breathe fresh air. It is rumored that the famous Cossack leader General Semenov has arrived in Tianjin. Although this has not been confirmed by officials, it has come from a reliable source. Semenov played an important role in Admiral Kolchak's Siberian campaign. The admiral's activities in the Outer Baikal region were greatly restricted. He is currently the leader of the Far East White Russian Anti-Communist Movement sponsored by the Japanese. The White Russian community in Tianjin is united with him. Semenov's arrival in Tianjin has sparked much speculation, which is believed to be related to the tense situation in Tianjin. This proves that the Japanese are now trying to link the White Russian movement with the anti-British movement in North China. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Tianjin Incident and the United States</h3>
<p>More than ten days have passed since the Tianjin Incident occurred, and Britain is still hesitant. The so-called "retaliation" and "strong confrontation" have, at least for now, only shown a posture of preparation. As time passes, the invaders' ferocity may not be contained at any time! However, in this dark sky, a ray of dawn is also revealed, that is, the attitude of the United States is gradually becoming clear.</p>
<p>In China, in the United States, and even in world opinion, it is believed that the actions of the United States have a decisive force on the Far East issue today. The Japanese side certainly has not been ignorant of this, so when the Tianjin Incident was launched, it quickly expressed its flattery, declaring special preferences for Americans. Of course, Japan's true intention is not to permanently favor the United States. Under the slogan of establishing a new order in East Asia, the interests of Europe and the United States in the Far East will be equally squeezed out anyway; Japan's current appeasement of the United States is only an attempt to ease the international atmosphere and alienate democratic countries. In short, Japan's inner fear of the United States cannot be concealed by any superficial articles of petty faith and petty favors, but is clearly seen by the Americans.</p>
<p>To be honest, the interests of the United States in Tianjin are not very significant. There are only about 400 American expatriates in the city, with assets of only 12 million yuan. Assuming that the United States is a country that only values ​​private interests, the United States may as well sit on the sidelines of the Tianjin Incident. Assuming that the United States sells out its interests in Tianjin for private gain, Japan is willing to compensate with additional benefits. Moreover, if the United States wants to be selfish, there are so-called isolationists at home who represent the interests of some capitalists to praise it; there are "quasi" spokespersons instructed by Japan to praise it. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has always used the existence of isolationists and quasi-spokespersons to constantly send autumn waves to the United States; currently, because the United States does not have major interests in Tianjin, it simply uses alienation to try to get the United States to leave the united front of democratic countries in the Far East.</p>
<p>However, Japan's attempt has apparently failed again. The United States' long-standing Open Door Policy in the Far East, which in the past blocked the conspiracy of division, has now become a bulwark against aggression and an iron rule to protect peace in the Far East and even the world. The United States has never been indifferent to the Far East issue. Why else would it have convened the Pacific Conference in 1921? Why else would it have loudly protested against Chinese aggression after the September 18th Incident? Originally, once the overall situation in the Far East is shaken, how can the Pacific situation be quiet? If the Pacific is not quiet, the United States will not only feel threatened for a while, but simply abandon its superior position and compete in production and sales with military equipment made with American wages against military equipment made with low Eastern wages. This is another point that the patriotic Americans can see clearly. Although the relationship between the Tianjin region and the United States is not very important, this incident is nothing more than a touchstone for the United States. "If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated?" If the interests of Tianjin can be abandoned, what about the interests of Shanghai? Even Guam, Yap, the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippine Islands, and other places, what about them? Therefore, Japan's small favors cannot shake the fundamental national policy of the United States. However, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States has always been prepared to take joint action with democratic countries, unwilling to launch alone. Therefore, when the Tianjin Incident first occurred, the United States could not take immediate action; however, the US government declared on the first day that its attitude towards the Far East event must be consistent with that of various democratic countries, which is tantamount to a solemn indication that it will not be confused. Sure enough, on the 21st of this month, the United States formally protested to Japan against the blockade and restrictions in Tianjin, and before protesting in Tianjin, it first filed strong protests regarding the bombing of American property and the opposition to the Gulangyu blockade, indicating that the United States' position on all Far East issues is consistent.</p>
<p>If the United States listens to Japan's seduction and adopts a wait-and-see attitude towards the Tianjin Incident, what rewards will it receive? American newspapers have already stated very clearly: "Since the Japanese blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin, the interests of Americans have also been hit. The Japanese intend to test the Western democratic countries' preparation and determination to oppose the New Order in East Asia; As for why the impact on the United States is the same as that on Britain and France? Because the position of the economic interests of all foreigners in China will take the result of this incident as a precedent." If the United States does not adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards the Tianjin Incident, what position should it take? US government personnel also have a very straightforward explanation: "After accidents continue to occur within China, the United States will have no choice but to choose one of the following two ways. In other words, if it does not completely withdraw from the Far East, it must stand up strongly and resist." This is the most important reason why the United States must participate in the Tianjin issue to speak out for justice.</p>
<p>The ambition of the aggressor is certainly not something that such speaking out for justice can contain; Since the United States can speak out for justice, it is certainly possible to launch further practical forces. Moreover, since the Tianjin issue occurred, Washington, London, and Paris have been in frequent contact, and since the United States can speak out, there must already be a kind of tacit understanding between the democratic countries. Therefore, how the Tianjin issue will develop in the future depends entirely on the extent to which the democratic countries tacitly understand each other and how practical forces are exerted. The United States has always been a good friend of China. Geographically, it is the two major countries facing each other in the east and west of the Pacific Ocean. Historically, there has been very little ill feeling between each other. It is said that the people of the two countries have very close contact due to missionary work, business, studying abroad, and other relationships, which has established a bond between the two countries. Since August 13th, the United States' assistance to China has not been small; However, the completion of the international united front against aggression in the Far East still depends on the United States to take the lead. Because only the United States has the least amount of constraints on the Far East issue and is most suitable to do this leading work. The Chinese people have always greatly admired the spirit of righteousness of the United States; And in addition to admiration, there is still an eager expectation. This is another point that the Americans know very well. This time, the United States' intervention in the Tianjin issue should not only be the dawn of the Tianjin issue itself, but also the starting point for the completion of the unified international front against aggression in the Far East.</p>
<h3>U.S. Values Rights and Interests in China; Will Defend Them With All Its Strength If Violated; Current Attitude Towards Japan Gradually Becoming Stronger; Actions of the Asiatic Fleet Highly Noteworthy</h3>
<p>(Washington) The opinions currently given to government leaders by the American people have shown that the American people have adopted a more active attitude towards the Far East issue. As for the official attitude, it is believed that although the U.S. has no direct relationship with the Tianjin incident, the U.S. is extremely concerned about the larger disputes caused by the Japanese. They pointed out that the actions of the Japanese have stopped American commerce, thus involving the United States in the Tianjin issue. At the same time, the State Department has gradually explored a stronger position, rejecting all Japanese requests to expand the incident. However, officials will not immediately explore strong actions against the Japanese. In fact, the U.S. has expressed its willingness to act as a mediator in the Tianjin incident. As for the actions of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Washington observers are paying close attention to it. They believe that the actions of the fleet are sufficient to show the basic policy of the U.S. government. If the plans that have not yet been approved by the government are passed, they will inevitably affect Japan's foreign trade. Whether this plan will be adopted will depend on the tendency of the Japanese actions thereafter.

<p>(Washington) According to Secretary of State Hull yesterday, U.S. representatives in Tianjin and Gulangyu are currently negotiating with the Japanese in order to transport a large amount of food into foreign concessions. It is said that according to a report from the U.S. Consul General in Tianjin, there is a large amount of food stacked in the ships at Dagukou, waiting to be transported into the Tianjin concession for supply. However, the Japanese military authorities have repeatedly refused the ships to transport food into Tianjin. The observers here generally believe that this negotiation by the U.S. is another major move after the protest against Japan. The U.S. has included a list of the losses suffered by U.S. expatriates in Tianjin in the protest letter, urging the Japanese to pay attention. Also, the U.S. has protested to Japan because of the blockade of Gulangyu, but the Japanese have not only refused the request, but also said that the food in Xiamen is not enough to supply the needs of the Gulangyu concession. In fact, the food in Xiamen not only has a surplus of food to supply to the outside, but also the Chinese in that area are quite willing to transport food to Gulangyu, but it has not been realized due to the Japanese navy's additional restrictions.

<h3>British Foreign Policy: Cannot Be Directed by Other Countries - Chamberlain's Speech to the Public</h3>
<p>(London) Today, when Prime Minister Chamberlain addressed an open-air demonstration in Cardiff, he touched upon the unacceptable insults and high-handed pressures exerted by Japanese soldiers against British nationals. He firmly stated that the British government's foreign policy would not be directed by other countries. The Prime Minister stated that the local dispute between Japan and us arose because several Chinese were accused of participating in an assassination attempt. The British and French concessions in Tianjin were subsequently blockaded, and Japanese soldiers exerted unacceptable pressures and intolerable insults on British nationals. This matter has been further complicated by public statements made by local Japanese officials. Japan is using this unfortunate incident as a pretext to make far-reaching demands that cannot be granted, seeking to change the policies that we and other governments have followed in these territories to date. As of now, the Japanese government has not made a formal request of this nature. If this case remains limited to the original dispute, there is still a possibility of resolving it through negotiation. The Prime Minister concluded by saying, "I feel obliged to add one more point: the British government's foreign policy must not be directed by other countries. Therefore, I firmly believe that it is right for us to expect that the Japanese government has no such intention." (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) All newspapers have given prominent coverage, with large headlines, to the violence inflicted by Japanese sentries in Tianjin on Mr. Davis and six other Britons. The newspapers have given great importance to Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks yesterday regarding this intolerable insult. Although the Prime Minister later said that he did not believe it was yet time to take retaliatory measures, the newspapers expressed approval of the aforementioned remarks. Foreign affairs correspondents for the various newspapers praised Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax for clearly informing the Japanese Ambassador, Mamoru Shigemitsu, of the British government's sense of displeasure. The Daily Mail reported that there are a total of 15,000 Britons residing in China and Japan who could be harassed by the Japanese, while there are 50,000 Japanese residing in British Empire territories who are under British protection. The Washington correspondent of The Times claimed that the American government has fully demonstrated its tolerance for Japanese discrimination and countless acts of tyranny, but it is now showing signs that it can no longer endure this situation.

<h3>British Nationals Mistreated in Tianjin, Britain Lodges Another Protest with Japan, Britain Will Be Forced to Make Important Decisions</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax held a meeting with Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu for twenty minutes this afternoon, during which he lodged another protest with the ambassador regarding the mistreatment of British nationals in Tianjin and inquired about Japan's intentions regarding the Tianjin issue. However, not only was Ambassador Shigemitsu unable to provide a clear explanation on this matter, but there was also no reliable information from Tokyo. Therefore, whether the Japanese government supports our claim to assist the Chinese people and wants to "generalize" the Tianjin incident, or whether it is willing to treat it as a local incident and find a way to resolve it, diplomatic circles here are still unable to understand. Generally speaking, the British government still intends to wait for some time before deciding on retaliation against Japan. However, according to people in Parliament, the government will wait for no more than a few days. If Japan is still unwilling to resolve the Tianjin case through diplomatic channels at that time, the government will be forced by public opinion to make an important decision, first abolishing the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911, and then further restricting the amount of Japanese goods imported and imposing special taxes on Japanese goods. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu at the Foreign Office yesterday and lodged a serious protest against the "intolerable insults" inflicted by Japanese troops in Tianjin on British nationals. The Foreign Secretary also asked the Japanese Ambassador to submit the British protest (and warning) to the Tokyo authorities. During the conversation, Halifax listed the various facts of British nationals being insulted and issued a warning, saying that if Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin continue to be rude to foreigners, the crisis in the area will be even more difficult to resolve. It is said that Shigemitsu has agreed to forward the British protest to the Tokyo authorities and said that he could not answer regarding the solution to the Tianjin case as a local matter. After Shigemitsu bid farewell to the British Foreign Secretary, the London police authorities dispatched many additional patrol officers to guard the Japanese Ambassador's residence because there was a suspicious person in front of the residence, driving a car back and forth for a long time without leaving. According to the person, he was only testing the car's brakes and had no other intentions, so the patrol officers released him after a brief interrogation. Detectives from Scotland Yard left afterward, but many police officers remained around the Japanese Ambassador's residence, guarding and protecting it. It is said that the British Foreign Secretary had asked the Japanese Ambassador to clarify the situation in Tianjin, because the British are still unclear as to whether Japan is treating the Tianjin case as a local matter and can resolve everything locally, or whether, as the head of the Japanese troops in the area said, the blockade can only be lifted after the British authorities recognize the puppet regime in Beijing and stop aiding the Chongqing government. British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated the British government's position in the House of Commons yesterday, so the wording of the Foreign Secretary's protest must be very strong and without doubt.

It is believed that the mastermind of the conference is currently maintaining close contact with the United States. It is heard that the Japanese invasion of southern China, the occupation of Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands are currently under discussion, and the representatives are also paying attention to the urgency of protecting the oil fields in Borneo in the event of war in the Far East.

Also, yesterday, the Singapore conference decided that Britain and France do not need to increase their naval strength in the Far East for the time being. It is said that they believe that the current British and French navies in the Far East are sufficient to deal with the Japanese side, and after an incident occurs, Britain and France can immediately transfer the navy to China from the Mediterranean.

The newspaper continued that Britain intends to include Siam in the Far East strategic outline, because once a war breaks out in the Far East, Singapore and the Malay Archipelago are at risk of being cut off from contact, unless Siam joins the Far East strategic outline and becomes the hinterland of Britain's Far East defense line, the safety of Singapore and the Malay Archipelago can be guaranteed. "The Daily Telegraph" reported that the Dutch East Indies authorities are also paying close attention to the Singapore military conference and have sent officials to Singapore to informally exchange views with the British and French military authorities at the conference.

<h3>Goebbels' Speech, Germany Needs Colonies, Self-Reliance and National Strength Are Now Different From the Past, Determined to Strive for Interests Vital to Survival</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, following his speech in the city of Danzig, delivered an important speech yesterday to more than 20,000 workers of the Berlin Transport Company, elaborating on Germany's current policies. His remarks were roughly as follows: "If it is said that countries pursuing imperialism harbor the ambition to conquer the world, then the policies pursued by Germany have no such intention. If it is said that pursuing imperialism lies in seeking the needs vital to the survival of a nation, then Germany is truly an imperialist. Germans firmly believe that the position we occupy does not meet the requirements that we should rightfully deserve. Germans do not want to continue to live under the sanctions of the Treaty of Versailles. Since the accession to power of the leader Hitler, Germany's national strength has been increasing day by day, and its military strength ranks first in the world. German engineers and workers have completed a wall of steel in the west," and one day they will reap the rewards of years of hard work. "Today we still demand colonies, not because Germany wants to become a rich country, but for the German people. We live in this space, which is severely restricted, without natural resources, raw materials, gold, silver, and other countries all possess such resources, so we should announce this situation to all countries. Today, countries around the world should be able to understand Germany's peaceful demands, which are also the demands of our entire nation. If countries cannot understand this demand, then Germany will closely consider the needs that are indispensable to its survival. All our workers should abide by the policy principles of the National Socialist Party. It must be known that the policies pursued by the leader Hitler are all based on the interests of our entire nation." (Haitong, 24th)</p>

The British government will supply the United States with rubber of equal value to the American cotton, with a total amount not exceeding 80,000 tons. The purpose of this agreement is to enable the two governments to cooperate in storing important items to prevent possible war. Britain wants to store cotton, and the United States wants to store rubber. The storage of these items is solely for the purpose of preventing war and will not be transferred for commercial use. The first clause of the agreement stipulates that in the absence of war, these items must be stored for at least seven years. When they need to be cleared, the two governments are responsible for consulting each other and making every effort to avoid disturbing the market. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Reaffirms Diplomatic Strategy: Aiming to Establish Peace, Hoping for Early Restoration of International Confidence, Determined to Resist Any Aggressive Attempts</h3>
<p>Cardiff, England: Prime Minister Chamberlain recently attended a Conservative Party meeting here and delivered an important speech. He first expressed his respects to the King and Queen, saying that the King and Queen received a warm welcome during their tour of the Americas. "This matter is of great benefit to the unity of the British Empire and the friendship between the British and American peoples. To this day, the unity of the Empire is more important than ever, and it is gratifying that the King and Queen inspected Canada this year. Some accuse Britain of being one of the 'rich countries,' deliberately making things difficult for 'poor countries,' which is completely unfounded. The reason is that Britain has not exploited its colonies to benefit its own country. On the contrary, it regards itself as a trustee, intending to assist culturally backward races, so as to improve their living conditions and govern themselves without our assistance. This principle is gradually being implemented, because all members of the British Empire adhere to the ideals of freedom and independence, and the strength of their union always aims to establish peace and maintain peace. This is known throughout the world. For this reason, the British Empire can be said to be a pillar of peace. As far as the relationship between Britain and Germany is concerned, what I regret most is that the future of Europe is now being destroyed by unfounded suspicion and false propaganda. For example, the German people are indeed uneasy, saying that Britain is implementing an encirclement policy against them, or that Germany's natural and reasonable development in commerce is now being contained by other countries, and is encountering economic oppression, so that their living standards are gradually declining, until they are destroyed. All these rumors are endless. It is lamentable that our country's attitude is being misinterpreted in this way. In fact, our country's foreign policy has always been consistent. In short, what our country seeks is to establish world peace, so that all nations can live and work in peace. In this world, if countries can restore mutual confidence, Britain and Germany will also be able to cooperate with each other to develop inexhaustible resources. However, if Germany cannot abandon its unfair suspicions of other countries and is unwilling to openly discuss with rational nations, then this happy future is just a pipe dream."</p>
<p>Then the Prime Minister touched on the situation in the Far East (see page 4) and explained that Britain's military strength today is not only very different from what it was a year ago, but is also expanding day by day, so no matter what happens in the future, it can be dealt with calmly and without fear. As for "our country's navy is invincible in the world, and although it is not convenient to tell you how many aircraft our air force has, I dare to say that the rapid development of the air force in the past year has exceeded the expectations of ordinary people. The combat effectiveness of the air force officers and soldiers and the speed and power of the aircraft are beyond the reach of other countries. As for our country's methods of protecting civilians, progress is very rapid, and the organization is complete and detailed. In short, although our country's military preparations are not intended to threaten other countries, we will definitely resist any aggressive or controlling attempts. Our country's mutual assistance agreements with various related countries have this as their sole objective. In other words, our country will naturally protect the independence of all countries that are fearful of the fate suffered by other countries. Thinking of this, what I want to reiterate is that changing the status quo is only possible through discussion and cooperation. If you want to achieve your goals by force, then we will definitely resist it. I hope that all nations who seek peace can adopt a firm will and a calm attitude, so that they can achieve their wishes." (24th dispatch from Havas)</p>

(5) After signing this declaration, France and Turkey may still freely conclude various agreements with other countries for the general interests of peace.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Bonnet made a statement, explaining the importance of this declaration, saying that its content is the same as the British-Turkish mutual assistance declaration of May 12. The three countries of Britain, France, and Turkey therefore have the same obligations to each other, which will definitely help peace and is sufficient to prove that the friendly relations between France and Turkey are seamless, which is very gratifying. Turkish Ambassador Suad also expressed his joy. (23rd dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>Ankara, Turkey: Regarding the issue of incorporating the Sanjak region (French mandate) of the Syrian Republic into Turkish territory, the French-Turkish agreement was signed by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu and French Ambassador Massigli at 1:10 PM today. This issue is completely resolved. The French troops stationed in the area will be completely withdrawn by July 22. (23rd dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the issue of incorporating the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic into Turkish territory, France and Turkey have signed an agreement in the Turkish capital. The terms have not yet been published, but responsible sources claim that the main points of the agreement are four:</p>
<p>(1) France, within the scope of its rights, agrees to cede the Sanjak region to Turkey. (2) Turkey recognizes that the current boundaries of the Syrian Republic are immutable and that any measures that could endanger the territorial integrity and internal security of the Syrian Republic should be avoided. Residents of the Sanjak region who do not wish to obtain Turkish nationality may sell all their property and leave the area within six months. (3) The Küpeli Akra highlands in the Sanjak region still belong to Syria.</p>
<p>Diplomatic figures here recently declared that from now on, there will be no more barriers between France and Turkey. It can be predicted that the friendly relations between the two countries will be further enhanced. In addition, Foreign Minister Bonnet, on behalf of the government, issued a declaration, stating that France does not intend to abandon its mission in the Syrian and Lebanese Republics during the current mandate period and allow third countries to obtain convenience.

<h3>Democratic Countries Express Joy, While Germany and Italy Are Quite Indignant</h3>
<p>Paris: The mutual assistance declaration signed between France and Turkey has recently been commented on by diplomatic figures. Turkey's current policy, although seeking harmony with the Soviet Union, does not follow the Soviet Union's lead, which can be seen from this. Members of Congress also said that Britain and France are eager for the Soviet Union to join the international security mechanism as soon as possible. At this time, Turkey has stated its position before the Soviet Union joins, so the position of Britain and France when negotiating with the Soviet Union can be strengthened. In addition, France delayed signing a mutual assistance declaration with Turkey because the Sanjak region had not been resolved. Germany took the opportunity to urge Turkey to change its policy, but it did not get its wish. At this time, Turkey is also conspiring to get closer to Egypt, and Egypt is also planning to conclude a mutual assistance agreement with Greece and conclude commercial agreements with Yugoslavia and Romania, which can also allow the Balkan Entente countries to obtain external assistance. (23rd dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>London: Although the signing of the French-Turkish mutual assistance declaration was expected, political figures here were still very happy to hear about it, believing that it was enough to supplement the British-Turkish mutual assistance declaration, thereby ensuring the safety of the eastern Mediterranean, and at the same time allowing the strength of peace-loving countries to be strengthened in order to resist aggressive attempts. (23rd dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Regarding the mutual assistance declaration recently signed between France and Turkey, political figures here all expressed joy, saying that this is "an effective guarantee for maintaining the status quo in the eastern Mediterranean," which is also a necessary supplement to the British-Turkish mutual assistance declaration of May 12 and opens the way for the Turkish-Egyptian agreement. (23rd dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>Washington: Diplomatic figures here expressed a warm welcome to the mutual assistance declaration signed between France and Turkey, saying that the strength of the European peace front will be strengthened as a result, and it will also have a good impact on the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (23rd dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin: After the establishment of the French-Turkish mutual assistance declaration and the agreement on the Sanjak region, German political figures expressed indignation, believing that this move was also "a link in the encirclement chain," and also pointed out that the cession of the Sanjak region was an "immoral" action, therefore taking the opportunity to loudly demand the recovery of old colonies and various places currently ruled by various countries. The Nazi Party's organ, the "People's Observer," stated that "The democratic countries are now arbitrarily destroying the current treaties. After the establishment of the French-Turkish mutual assistance declaration, Italy's position in the Mediterranean will be affected. The agreement established between Britain and Italy on April 16 last year strictly stipulated that the status quo in the Mediterranean should be maintained. This provision is now destroyed by France." (23rd dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The "Foreign Traffic News" stated that the return of Alexandretta to Turkey is destroying the status quo in the Mediterranean and France's "sacred trusteeship obligation." Since the Great War, the Western powers have first decided to return the stolen property to its original owner, but those people have used all possible tricks to refuse to return Germany's colonies. (23rd dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome: The transfer of the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic (French mandate) to Turkey was recently commented on by Fascist figures here, who said that France has already violated the obligations of a mandate power. During the Abyssinian War, the League of Nations made many demands on Italy. Now France arbitrarily disposes of a part of the territory of a mandate territory, and the League of Nations has not expressed any objection, which is inevitably strange. (23rd dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>Turkey Considers Fortifying the Sanjak Region, Turning It into a Strategic Base</h3>
<p>Ankara: It has been learned here that Turkey intends to turn Alexandretta into a valuable strategic base. In view of its new obligations to Britain and France in the Mediterranean, the country has recently considered plans to modernize and re-fortify the Sanjak region, so that the area becomes part of an important military area. (24th dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>German-Danish Non-Aggression Pact Enters into Force</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German-Danish non-aggression treaty has entered into force after both parties recently exchanged ratification documents here. (24th dispatch from Havas)</p>

<h3>Situation Before Shantou Fell: Japanese Side Buys Off Bandits to Disrupt Chinese Forces, Japanese Planes Bomb Wuhua, Xingning, and Longchuan for Days, British and American Ships Stationed in Shantou to Protect Foreign Ships Entering and Exiting</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese warship at Mayu Estuary in Shantou dispatched a speedboat on the 14th to break through the Mayu blockade line and advanced towards Getou Village in Aotou, attempting to land. It was repelled by Chinese forces. It was heard that Chen Qiaer, the bandit leader of Shalong, Chaoyang, was also assisted by Japanese warships and attempted to respond in Shalong and Mawei to disrupt the rear of the Chinese forces in Dahao and Haimen. When it was heard that the Japanese speedboat had been defeated and three ships had been sunk, killing and wounding 20 to 30 people, Bandit Chen also remained hidden, but secretly extorted military supplies from wealthy families in nearby villages and wrote threatening letters. The wealthy families ignored him. Li Kejiang, the shop owner of Tongli Fish Bank in Dahao, was therefore kidnapped by Bandit Chen in Mawei, his hometown, and a ransom of 6,000 yuan was demanded. Wealthy families in various villages were terrified upon hearing the news, and many came to Shantou to stay temporarily on the 18th, and some fled to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Starting on the 16th, the Japanese army dispatched multiple aircraft to drop bombs on the Guangdong-Jiangxi Highway in Dalongtian, Xingning. After dropping the bombs, they opened fire and strafed, causing considerable local losses. At 9 AM on the 17th, another 15 Japanese aircraft, in three batches, attacked Wuhua and Xingning. The aircraft took off from Guangzhou. At approximately 8 AM, two aircraft flew to Longchuan in the upper reaches of the Dong River, passing through Laolong and Zijin into Wuhua, dropping five bombs in Shuizhai and Xikeng. At approximately 10 AM, Japanese aircraft were spotted over Heyuan, Dongxi, Longchuan, Laolong, and other places, heading straight for Xingning to destroy the land transportation on the Guangdong-Jiangxi border. At 4 PM, another two Japanese aircraft flew to Xingning to scout for an hour, but did not drop bombs. The Mei area suffered considerable losses. On the morning of the 19th, an additional Japanese aircraft carrier arrived offshore of Shantou, bringing the total to seven ships, including cruisers, destroyers, and transports, anchored in deep water off Nan'ao. At 8 AM, two Japanese aircraft took off from the sea, scouting along the coastline before flying to Yixi Station outside the North Gate of Chao'an, strafing along the land and water transportation lines. The Yongning electric ferry was hit by gunfire on the Caijiawei River, killing four passengers and wounding over 20. The Japanese aircraft then turned towards Jieyang and went out to sea, firing all the way, killing and wounding over 30 people near Quxi, killing four and wounding three in Paotai City. Wherever the Japanese aircraft passed, there were casualties in various villages. The actual numbers are unknown. Zhalin, Huanggang, Qiandong, and other places also suffered gunfire attacks. The citizens scattered in panic, and the order was chaotic for a time.</p>
<p>The first section of the Chao-Shan Railway has been dismantled, and the main station has been moved to Anbu. Since the 17th, the railway company has provided two electric ferries to transport passengers, departing from Shantou to Anbu once every morning from 5 AM to 4 PM. Passengers disembark at Meixitou and walk a mile before they can take a car. After the forced evacuation in Shantou City, according to the household registration section's investigation, there are still over 40,000 residents. The municipal government has decided to conduct a general registration of citizens. Those who do not need to be evacuated will be issued "residence permits." Those without "residence permits" will be forcibly evacuated to avoid being constrained during an emergency battle. There is one British and one American warship in Shantou harbor, anchored at Qilu and Jiaoshi, respectively. Another larger British warship is anchored outside the Mayu Estuary to protect foreign ships from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia entering and exiting. On the 18th, the Haicheng ship returned to Shantou from Fuzhou and Quanzhou. According to the crew, the goods transported from the port to Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen could not be unloaded. Every time a small boat tried to come to connect, it was shot at and strafed by Japanese armed fishing boats and returned to the port. The original goods are now being returned to Hong Kong, and the freight is also being returned to the shippers. The shipping company lost over 200,000 yuan. The blockade of Gulangyu is even stricter. All boats are not allowed to travel. British ships cannot load and unload passengers and goods, while Japanese ships, such as the Guangdong Maru, often load goods from Taiwan to Xiamen. Transportation between Gulangyu and Xiamen is entirely controlled by Japanese warships. Ships and boats with passes, as well as Japanese and Taiwanese people, can travel between Gulangyu and Xiamen. The Japanese people living in Gulangyu do not have to worry about a shortage of grain. British ships also transport food to help foreigners living in Gulangyu. What is pitiful is that the 50,000 Chinese people there are facing food prices that are twice as high. The situation there is no different from Shantou. There are multiple American, British, and French warships stationed in Gulangyu to protect overseas Chinese without any changes. Shantou and Xiamen are only separated by a narrow strip of water, and their interests, fortunes, and misfortunes are closely related. After Xiamen was severely blockaded, many people from southern Fujian entered and exited through Shantou. There are British ships traveling to Manila that cannot disembark in Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen, so they specially diverted to Shantou. All countries attach great importance to Shantou. Rear Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. South China Fleet, arrived in Shantou from Gulangyu on the cruiser No. 227 on the 16th and visited Mayor Wu at the municipal government. The U.S. Consul held a banquet in his honor. In the evening, the U.S. Commander returned to Hong Kong on the original ship.</p>
<h3>After the Bombing of Chengdu, Population and Materials Evacuated; Over Seven Hundred Civilian Casualties on the 11th</h3>
<p>Chengdu Air Report: Twenty-seven Japanese aircraft raided Chengdu on June 11, indiscriminately bombing civilian and commercial areas, causing tragic casualties among the people and burning down numerous civilian houses. The Municipal Government and the City Defense Corps issued separate loss statistics on the 13th and 16th. (1) According to the Municipal Government's statistics, there were four categories: burnt, hit by bombs, collapsed due to impact, and demolished. Based on addresses, there were 1,215 numbers; assuming five households per number, there were 6,075 households. Among them were three cultural institutions: West China University, Provincial Chengdu Normal School, and Huayang County Middle School. The rest were civilian residences, factories, and shops. (2) According to the City Defense Corps' statistics, a total of 61 bombs were dropped, of which 19 were unexploded, 24 were incendiary bombs, with nine unburnt, 498 houses were shaken by the impact, and 741 houses were burned. Forty-three members of the Defense Corps died in the line of duty, 23 were seriously injured, 58 were slightly injured, 576 civilians were injured, and 168 died.</p>
<p>During the air raid, Chengdu Medical Director Chen Zhongyao and police officer Cao Chun heroically sacrificed their lives. More than a dozen others were injured. On the 15th at noon, the Provincial Capital Police Department held a public memorial service for the loyal souls of Chen and Cao within the department. All police officers in the city wore flowers to mourn. Except for those on duty, all participated in the memorial service. The Provincial Capital Police Chief Zhou Jiying also led important police officers to visit injured police officers in various hospitals. Furthermore, over 500 rickshaw pullers in Chengdu spontaneously organized on the 12th and 13th, under the leadership of the Municipal Government, to clean the streets. Chengdu Mayor Yang Quanyu praised the rickshaw pullers for their tireless efforts and awarded each of them 25 cents in foreign currency on the 14th, and each team received one yuan for cigarette expenses as a reward. Additionally, the Ministry of Education reported that over 360 members of the five major rescue teams, including those from West China University, set out to work in the bombed areas immediately after the air raid, rescuing 43 slightly injured and 85 seriously injured individuals. Ms. Huang Xiaolian, a team member, sacrificed her life due to a facial injury, and Ms. Cui Zhihua's foot was penetrated by a bullet. Team member Gan Yongxiang vomited blood due to excessive effort during the rescue. Special commendations were issued on the 16th. The teachers and students of the five major schools deeply mourned Ms. Huang Xiaolian's loyalty and sacrifice and held an enlarged memorial service on the 16th. Furthermore, Deng Xihou, the Commander of the Sichuan Provincial Air Defense, decided to provide compensation to the families of the Defense Corps members who died in the line of duty and to provide proper treatment to those injured, and had produced many honorary medals for the injured, which were distributed to the injured members. He also used white satin to make several banners with the inscription "Glorious Sacrifice" and presented them to the families of the deceased Defense Corps members as a sign of honor.</p>
<p>Various parties are actively preparing for future air raid relief work. The Sichuan Provincial Poor People's Housing Management Office is completing a certain location as a reception center for injured citizens within the week. The poor children's orphanage also started construction on the 13th. The timber for the poor people's housing has been purchased and construction will begin immediately to facilitate the evacuation of the general poor population. The Chengdu Air Raid Emergency Relief Center held an ad hoc meeting on the 16th and decided to establish two field hospitals for seriously injured individuals at Koukou'an and Koukouqiao, equipped with 1,000 beds for rescue purposes. Two temporary shelters were set up at Huayang County Middle School and Lida Middle School to accommodate the elderly, weak, women, and children. A bandage station was established outside the four city gates to facilitate the treatment of minor injuries. The Chengdu Municipal Women's Movement Committee is now organizing five rescue teams, with some medicine, to participate in rescue work in the event of an air raid.</p>
<p>Merchants and residents have been evacuating day and night in recent days. By the 17th, the evacuation was largely completed. During the intensified evacuation, the city and its outskirts were filled with bustling traffic day and night. Now the city's material resources have also been evacuated. Shops have only a few samples and goods. Buyers must register first and can only receive the goods the next day, or go to the countryside to buy them directly. The magnificent glass decorations of department stores have been transported to the countryside and replaced with printed cloth or paper. Only a few goods remain in the watch shops. The large glass mirrors in barbershops are nowhere to be seen. The business hours of restaurants have also been changed. Theaters and cinemas have been closed since June 1 and are looking for new locations to build in the countryside. Watching plays and movies also requires going to the countryside. All production businesses have been moved to the evacuation areas, and producers are working diligently in the countryside with peace of mind.</p>
<h3>A Brief Record of the Fujian Provincial Assembly; The Resolutions Include About Four Meanings</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The first session of the Provisional Fujian Provincial Assembly opened on May 15 and closed on the 38th, lasting 14 days. All 35 assembly members, with 31 members in attendance. The speaker was Zheng Zuyin, an executive member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the deputy speaker was Chen Peikun, a standing committee member of the Provincial Disaster Relief Association and the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce. Seven general meetings were held for decisions, seven sessions for review, and 94 proposals were submitted. Apart from one important policy guideline submitted by the Provincial Government for discussion, the rest were proposed by the assembly members, including six general proposals, 24 related to special wartime political affairs, 22 related to civil affairs, 18 related to financial and economic construction, and 13 related to education and culture. After being reviewed by various review committees, these 94 proposals were organized and consolidated into 60 items. Among them, 49 items were passed by the General Assembly, six were withdrawn, one was retained, one was withdrawn by the original proposer, and three were left for discussion in the next session. Generally speaking, most of the proposals were passed. The resolutions of important nature include the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization, the protection of civil rights, the elimination of malpractices in conscription, the improvement of tax collection methods, the evacuation of coastal residents and the solution of livelihood issues for people relocating inland, the adjustment of educational administration, the promotion of women's work, and the protection of children. As for inquiries to the government, there was one related to the evacuation of the population, one related to civil affairs, five related to financial and economic construction, and one related to education and culture, all of which received detailed and satisfactory answers. After the meeting was adjourned, a declaration was issued, which stated that "the resolutions of this session have four meanings: (1) To strengthen military power by mobilizing the masses; (2) To protect civil rights without infringing on national sovereignty; (3) To gather national power without harming the people's strength; and (4) To strengthen emergency-period orders without disrupting fundamental national policies."</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Orders Each County to Repair Dikes and Embankments, Urging the Masses to Expedite Work During Agricultural Downtime</h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously formulated rules and regulations for each county to repair dikes and embankments to defend against floods, and instructed each county to comply. Now, in order to expedite the construction of dikes and embankments by the masses and quickly achieve results, it is once again instructing each county to expedite the process. The order reads as follows: "Upon investigation, the Yellow River breach in Henan last summer has been repeatedly appealed to the relevant ministries and departments of the Central Government to quickly find ways to close it. However, due to its proximity to the war zone, it is temporarily difficult to start construction. Northern Jiangsu is located downstream, and even the Huai River is difficult to contain. Now that the Yellow and Huai Rivers have converged, once they flow down, the floods will be rampant and unstoppable. Millions of people will fear for their lives. Now that the best strategy of closing the breach is difficult to implement temporarily, we have to take temporary measures, organize an engineering committee to be responsible for dredging the rivers downstream into the sea to allow for the smooth discharge of accumulated water and empty the reservoirs. At the same time, we will prepare a plan for closing and repairing the Yun River and renovating the gates, and request funding from the Central Government for construction, to serve as a defense. However, the construction of dikes and embankments in each county and the dredging of silted river channels are also important for flood prevention. When the water rises, they can defend against floods, and when the water is low, they can store water for irrigation. Their benefits are closely related to the people. In order to expedite the work and facilitate implementation, the temporary measures for the construction of dikes and embankments in each county have been formulated and circulated for compliance. It is noted that while some counties are earnestly complying, there are also many instances of treating them as mere formalities and evading responsibility. It is essential to know that this matter is of great importance to the lives of the people. Now that the floodwaters have receded and the rice seedlings have been planted, it is the agricultural downtime. Urgently send personnel to each district, township, and town to strictly supervise and mobilize the entire population to complete the construction of dikes and embankments within the shortest possible time, so that there is a defense during the upcoming flood season, and to prevent a catastrophe. It is hereby ordered that each county comply and report for record."</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Kunshan Blockade Chenmu Town to Prevent Guerrilla Attacks</h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: Chenmu is an important town bordering Kunshan, Lian, Wu, and Kun counties, with thriving commerce and convenient transportation. Since last autumn, the Japanese army has stationed a part of its troops in the town. The guerrillas stationed near the village of × near the town suddenly attacked the town the night before last. The Japanese army responded in a hurry, resulting in casualties on both sides. The Japanese army rushed to the Kunshan military headquarters to request additional troops to be stationed to prevent further guerrilla attacks. At the same time, the Japanese army further blockaded Chenmu Town, and strictly inspected the passing steamships and civilian ships, and did not allow them to pass through the town. It has been more than a week, and the town is experiencing a great shortage of food and daily necessities, causing great panic among the residents.</p>
<h3>The Puppet County Government of Qingpu Collects Folk Books</h3>
<p>In the Name of Restoring the Library</p>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: Under the pretext of restoring the library, the puppet county government of Qingpu has been collecting folk books on a large scale in recent days, and has forced the former director of the county library to hand over the books in the library. Most of the books in the county library were donated by local people, so there are many rare books. After the war, these books were gradually transported to the countryside, so although the library was looted, the losses were minimal. It is recently heard that the director has fled elsewhere due to threats.</p>
<h3>The Circumstances of the Murder of Yu Guozhen, a Veteran of the Anti-Japanese War in Wuxi; The New Fourth Army Has Arrested and Executed the Culprits</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The Hua Fang military authorities previously sent Shangguan Yunxiang to Jiangsu to reorganize the guerrilla forces in various counties, with the cooperation of the New Fourth Army. In Wuxi, three brigades have been established: Wu Yaozu in Anzhen, Yang Xiaonan in Erhouqiao, and Zhou Afu in Qianqiao. Yu Guozhen's troops in the northern countryside had already accepted reorganization when Dong Huimin and Guo Xishi lured him a week ago under the pretense of a banquet. They ambushed him on the way, shot Yu to death, and completely killed his family. Everyone who heard about it felt sorry for him. Yu had worked very hard in the anti-Japanese war, such as the loss of more than 100 boxes of bullets by the Japanese army at the railway station, the assassination of two senior Japanese officers near the railway station, the interception of Japanese weapons on the Wuxi-Shanghai highway, and the assassination of traitors Wu Zhengrong and Zhong Jiyue in the downtown area of the city, and the attack on the puppet secret service police station in the Retin area of Beitang were all done by Yu Guozhen. Therefore, the Japanese offered a reward of 100,000 yuan to try to capture him, which shows the importance the Japanese attached to Yu. The New Fourth Army was furious at Yu's murder and sent a brigade to the Bashiqiao area to arrest Dong Huimin, Guo Xishi, etc. Dong fled with his gang upon hearing the news, while Guo Xishi was arrested on the spot and executed immediately.</p>
<p>At present, the guerrilla forces in various villages have three names: (1) Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, (2) Third War Zone Guerrilla Brigade, (3) Military Commission Wuxi Guerrilla Brigade. At the same time, there is also the County Security Team. The Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army is mainly led by Zhou Zhengang, the Third War Zone is led by Cai Renqi and Gao Zugao, the Military Commission is led by Deng Benduan and Qiang Xuehui, and the Security Team is led by Ji Boqin and Mao Mujun. It is a pity that they have not been able to unite. It is heard that the New Fourth Army is engaged in incorporating and training the guerrilla forces.</p>

<h3>The Only Way to Marital Bliss</h3>
<p>He who loves others is constantly loved by others. This is an eternal saying. A selfish person who only seeks his own enjoyment and does not care about the life or death of others will eventually suffer the consequences of his evil deeds. The various tragedies of married men and women that we hear and see cannot but be attributed to the selfishness of husbands in the remaining feudal society. The wife is his plaything, appendage, and at most, is regarded as property. The husband can be willful and indulge in lust, while the wife can only follow the three obediences and four virtues. Therefore, in married life, the wife's sacrifice is taken for granted.</p>
<p>Knowledge tells us that a woman's sexual tide is cyclical. For this reason, female animals often occupy a superior position in the animal kingdom. The male is only to meet the needs of the female. Like bees, silkworms, and other animals, the only responsibility of the male is to adapt to the mating of the female. After mating, its life is over. Humans, however, because of the male's physical strength, often occupy a superior position in society. Therefore, women are suppressed, and the emphasis on men over women still seems to have remnants of power in today's civilized society. In such an unbalanced life of male and female combination, one party must be sacrificed, but the other party is not necessarily better off. This is a very common phenomenon. The wife suffers from irregular menstruation and leukorrhea due to unreasonable sexual life, infertility, or multiple births, anemia, shriveled breasts, and premature aging, resulting in the loss of domestic help in the family. At the same time, due to the husband's early marriage indulgence in lust, or polygamy and licentiousness, or early self-abuse and spermatorrhea, various pathological conditions often erupt in sexual function, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, spermatorrhea, incomplete development, sperm deficiency and infertility, and neurasthenia. How can such a pathological husband live a happy married life and form a happy family?</p>
<p>Then, how can men and women seek marital happiness? It is said: Only in the harmony of mutual love and coordination of you being considerate of me and me being considerate of you, in the unity of desires. Then, since neither party is sacrificed physically or mentally, and they can mutually obtain pleasure, health will be improved accordingly, and happiness will increase day by day with the improvement of health!</p>
<p>If men and women suffer from the above-mentioned diseases due to premarital self-error and unreasonable married life, they must seek thorough treatment as soon as possible. If they delay treatment, the consequences will be endless! In today's era of advanced medicine, if the endocrine supplementation therapy of reproductive glands can be adopted, it is not difficult to cure the above-mentioned diseases. The "Germinal Substance", a reproductive gland hormone preparation for men and women, is reproduced according to this principle by extracting reproductive gland hormones from strong animals such as apes, gorillas, bears, deer, and sea dogs using scientific methods. Therefore, the quality is pure, the nutrients are completely preserved, and the efficacy begins within one hour after taking it. Within 24 hours, it will nourish sperm and kidneys for men, and regulate menstruation and remove leukorrhea for women. If taken continuously, it will promote development, nourish nerves, regulate metabolism, strengthen the brain, and activate blood circulation. It can cure various diseases radically in a short period of time, and long-term use can prolong life, rejuvenate, and restore youthfulness. Therefore, it is praised by world-renowned doctors as the only sacred medicine in endocrine agents. However, men with spermatorrhea must also take "Himi's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" (available in Wuzhou Zhongxi and other major pharmacies) to stop ejaculation for better results!</p>
<h3>Differentiation of Physiological and Pathological Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>In terms of physiology, the semen in a man's body is the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands. Part of it is stored in the seminal vesicles through the vas deferens, waiting to perform reproductive functions, and part of it directly seeps into the blood to regulate metabolism, promote development, nourish nerves, and excite emotions. A healthy unmarried man or a husband who is separated from his wife for a long time may have one or two spermatorrheas within one or two months due to the excess of semen produced physiologically. Those who do not feel tired or dizzy after the ejaculation are considered to have physiological spermatorrhea, but it is always better not to have it. If there are two or three instances of ejaculation within a month, and one feels tired and mentally exhausted afterwards, dreamful ejaculation is called nocturnal emission, and dreamless ejaculation is called spermatorrhea, which are undoubtedly pathological ejaculations. If semen leaks out even during the daytime after seeing female beauty, or during bowel movements or urination, or when using the brain excessively, it is a manifestation of spermatorrhea worsening into spermatorrhea.</p>
<p>According to the research results of medical scientists, it is known that a drop of semen is as precious as eighty drops of blood. An ejaculation is equivalent to losing one pound of blood. How shocking and terrifying is this? Therefore, young people must cure spermatorrhea as soon as possible. If they delay treatment, there will be endless consequences. The most common symptoms after untreated spermatorrhea are cerebral weakness and kidney deficiency, incomplete development, sallow complexion and thin muscles, and neurasthenia. This kind of pathological youth is common in today's society. Not only is it difficult to achieve academic success, but also in marital life, it cannot be happy, causing hatred from the wife, or no children, or one's own life ends, resulting in the greatest tragedy in life!</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is not an incurable disease. If effective medicine is taken, it can be effective. Effective medicines are praised by world-renowned doctors as "Himi's Semen-Consolidating Tablets". After taking it, it can consolidate the essence gate, calm the nerves, and allow for peaceful sleep, reduce dreams, and stop spermatorrhea on the same night. If there are the above-mentioned symptoms due to untreated spermatorrhea, you must also take the reproductive gland hormone agent "Germinal Substance" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use can radically cure various diseases as soon as possible and make the body healthier. Patients can come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections to achieve faster results.</p>

<h3>The Beauty of Breasts in Summer</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>In the hot world of scorching sun and sweltering heat, only healthy and beautiful women can stand out. Look: Their clothes are so few, so thin, with only a light sweat shirt and pants inside, and a cicada-wing-like qipao wrapped outside. Some women who wear Xiangyun gauze clothes don't even wear a sweat shirt. With such a light dress, undoubtedly, their characteristics are like the elastic springs, once the pressure is reduced, they become more upright. A pair of towering breasts stand side by side in front of the chest, and the two nipples are like newly budding grapes, becoming more and more upright and lovely! In addition, the slenderness of the figure and the plumpness of the buttocks naturally make the posture in action feel more moving and infinitely beautiful. Therefore, when they are virgins, they are fragrant everywhere and loved by people. They choose a passionate husband very much to their liking. Once married, the love between the sexes is very strong, forming a happy family and giving birth to clever children. How glorious and gratifying this is! However, those who have committed self-abuse in their early years, breast binding, or irregular menstruation, weakness after illness, prolonged leukorrhea, and malnutrition, resulting in the destruction of ovarian function, affecting the metabolism, and thus causing the breasts to atrophy and the loss of health and beauty, are not only unmatched in happiness, but are also hated by their husbands, and their fate must be very tragic! If you want to remedy it, you can only trust science. According to the research and experiments of world-renowned gynecologists such as Dr. Kang Delin and beauty experts such as Dr. Weiniqi, they all unanimously agree that taking the reproductive gland ovary endocrine preparation "Germinal Substance" for women is the most suitable and effective medicine. This agent is an extract of the ovarian essence of strong animals, and is combined with blood-nourishing and brain-nourishing components of mineral plants, and is precisely formulated by scientific methods. Therefore, after taking it, the ovarian function can be nourished, the metabolic activity can be enhanced, menstruation can be adjusted, the palace can be warmed and leukorrhea can be stopped within one day and night. If you continue to take it, not only can the atrophied breasts gradually become erect, and the thin arms gradually become plump, but also can make the cheeks rosy and youth last forever.</p>

<h3>On the Local Treatment and Total Treatment of Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>There is no fixed way to treat leukorrhea. Some are suitable for local treatment, and some are suitable for total treatment. Each should be applied according to the syndrome, so as to avoid the disadvantages of prejudice and delay the opportunity for treatment. Unfortunately, nowadays, general city doctors often only have a few small medical instruments due to insufficient equipment and negligent surgery, or stubbornly adhere to their prejudices, only adhering to certain ready-made medicines, and attacking experts with other modern equipment and scientific treatment methods. They reverse right and wrong, confuse black and white, in order to deceive people, which is related to the morality of doctors. By treating according to the syndrome, there is no fixed way. The method changes with the disease, and does not wait for the disease with the method. Therefore, stubborn and difficult-to-cure leukorrhea can all be completely cured by us.</p>
<p>For the treatment of gonorrhea, both local therapy and total therapy are indispensable. If the gonococcus is completely concentrated in the anterior urethra at the beginning, it is not inconsistent with the principles of science to use local therapy at this time. But other than that, injecting autogenous vaccine to increase the body's resistance to disease is also beneficial to the body. If the virus has entered the bloodstream and become a systemic infection, such as gonorrheal arthritis, it is useless to remove the urethra. However, clumsy doctors still boast about the magic of their local therapies. However, it is not impossible to use local therapy at the same time when using total therapy. I have always adopted safe and scientific methods for the treatment of all new and old gonorrhea. Such as German Hisch serum, German Filtrin current therapy, autogenous vaccine, prostate massage, Buqi urethral dilation, local washing method, or first inject bactericidal liquid into the urethra, and then insert the Filtrin current therapy conductor into the urethra to release electric current, so that it can also exert its bactericidal effect.</p>

Over 2,000 people attended, including university presidents, teachers, graduates, parents, and guests, all admitted by invitation. The upper and lower levels of the Grand Theater, with approximately 2,000 seats, were completely filled. The national flag of the Republic of China was hung on the right side of the hall, and the American flag on the left. In the center were the flags of the six participating universities. The stage was decorated with many pots of fresh flowers, creating a dignified and elegant atmosphere. The ceremony began on time, with the US Navy Band playing harmonious music, which invigorated the audience. Guests were ushered to their seats, and the male and female presidents and teachers of each university, as well as university graduates, all wearing doctoral and bachelor gowns, entered in an orderly fashion to the sound of music, creating a solemn and dignified atmosphere. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ceremony Proceedings</p>
<p>The ceremony began at 10:00 AM with music played by the US Navy Band. Then, guests, teachers, and graduates entered in order, and the entire audience stood at attention and sang "The Beautiful Land of China." Next, Dr. Bu Fangji gave a blessing, followed by a speech by President Fan Zhengkang and an address by American Judge Helmick. Immediately after, designated personnel from each university presented diplomas and awarded degrees. Dr. Bu Fangji then gave a final address and distributed awards to outstanding students. The ceremony concluded at around 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Number of Graduates</p>
<p>This year's graduates include 18 from Ginling College, 3 from Shanghai Women's Medical College, 30 from Hangchow University, 55 from Soochow University, 91 from Shanghai University, and 126 from St. John's University, totaling 323. Among them, the most were Bachelor of Arts, with 151, followed by Bachelor of Science with 83, Bachelor of Laws with 25, Doctor of Medicine with 24, Bachelor of Commerce with 15, Bachelor of Engineering with 11, Bachelor of Education with 8, and 3 with teacher's certificates. A total of 43 students received awards. 91 high school graduates from St. John's Middle School and 69 high school graduates from Soochow Middle School also attended the ceremony yesterday.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches</p>
<p>(1) President Fan Zhengkang of Shanghai University, representing all the universities, gave the opening speech, briefly stating that Christian higher education in Eastern China has temporarily opened in Shanghai in the past year or two due to environmental factors. Many difficulties and efforts have been encountered during this time, which cannot be fully described in a few words. However, gathering in one place due to the environment has given us a very good opportunity for cooperation, especially in the field of science. Due to the cooperative relationship, all science courses have been tested one by one, and books are gathered in one place for joint reading. The collection is rich, and there are many references. Furthermore, each university utilizes vacations and various gatherings to make cooperation more convenient. Based on past experience, cooperation is possible. Before cooperation, it cannot be said that there were no difficulties at all, but by overcoming difficulties and working hard, success will eventually be achieved. The success of this cooperation among the Christian universities of Eastern China can be considered a new era in the history of Chinese education. Today's joint graduation ceremony further demonstrates the spirit of cooperation among the universities. I use "struggle" and "union" to describe the current situation. In this great era, I feel that the four words "united struggle" are especially needed, so I submit this report and encourage each other. Today, we are honored to have American Judge Helmick and other guests present, and we respectfully ask for your guidance. (2) American Judge Helmick delivered a speech in English, mainly stating that in the past seventy-five years, scientific inventions and technological advances have brought both good and bad to mankind, depending on how they are applied. The current world economic system is flawed, with a vast gap between the rich and the poor, leading to various struggles between capital and labor. In my opinion, it is necessary to study the distribution of resources and the improvement of methods. You, who have received higher education, should take on some responsibility for the above two points when you go out into the world. Use new brains of the twentieth century, with fresh ideas, courageous aspirations, bright hearts, and noble personalities, to distinguish right from wrong, and know what to take and what to leave. In this way, you can find the truth and be happy in your heart. This kind of happiness comes from within, not from external sources. Otherwise, the more science is invented and the more skilled human beings become, without morality to help them, the progress of material things will only increase the cruelty of mankind. You must strive for this. Furthermore, the striving spirit of the school authorities is admirable, resulting in today's full house of graduates. I hope that progress will be boundless. I, on behalf of the American people, express sympathy and support for cooperation in Chinese education. (3) Dr. Bu Fangji gave a final address in English, mainly stating that when you graduate and leave school, whether you dedicate yourself to the country or serve the society, the success or failure of your future careers is related to the reputation of your alma mater. You must strive for this. Now, all countries in the world have university graduates. University graduates are cultivated by the country and nurtured by the family, and they receive relatively generous treatment. Therefore, the responsibilities you bear in all aspects after graduation are also heavier. You must strive for this. (4) Dean Shen Siliang gave a reply, briefly stating that today, the six Christian universities of Eastern China jointly held a graduation ceremony. We are very fortunate and grateful to have American Judge Helmick and other guests present to provide guidance. We are also very grateful to the owner of the Grand Theater for providing the venue for a large gathering.</p>

<h3>The Baoyin Charity Basketball Tournament Concludes Successfully - The Baoyin All-Stars Defeat Youyou by a Large Margin - The Result is 49 to 27 - In the Women's Game, the Black Eagles Easily Defeat the White Team</h3>
<p>The charity basketball tournament organized by the Shanghai Banking and Insurance Industry Association continued yesterday at the China Youth Gymnasium. Despite the hot weather, there were still over 500 spectators, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. In the first women's game, the Black Eagles were originally scheduled to play against the Isolated Island team. However, due to the absence of the Isolated Island team, the White team was temporarily selected to play. In the first half, the five-on-five game was evenly matched. In the end, the Black Eagles easily defeated the White team by 20 to 9. In the second men's game, the Baoyin All-Stars played against Youyou. Cai Yanxiong of the Baoyin All-Stars scored first, greatly boosting the morale of the All-Stars. Xue Chong scored three times in a row, and Xilin and Xue Chong and Yanxiong added eight more points. Youyou was at a loss. In the first half, the All-Stars scored 24 points, while Youyou scored 8 points. During the break, Zhuang Zuhan, the chairman of the Banking and Insurance Industry Association, publicly auctioned off the cold ball. Shao Changling, the chairman of Ning Shao Insurance Company, purchased it for 300 yuan, demonstrating admirable enthusiasm. The game continued, and Sun Damiao of Youyou added three points in a row, showing signs of revival. However, the All-Stars became active again, and at 13:30, the difference was as high as 17 points. Xue Chong made horizontal and vertical dunks, and the score soared. In the end, the Baoyin All-Stars defeated Youyou by 49 to 27.</p>

<h3>The Faber Cup Division Two - Lidu is the Champion</h3>
<p>Yesterday, they defeated China by 1 to 0</p>
<p>In the Faber Cup mini-football league, China played against Lidu in Division Two yesterday at 5:15 PM. China had won every game, while Lidu had one loss and one draw. However, since Hengchang Heng withdrew, the games were canceled and not counted, resulting in Lidu only having one draw. Therefore, this game was no less than the final of this division. If China could win or draw, they would win the championship. Otherwise, the championship would belong to Lidu. Therefore, both sides played very intensely and excitingly. Zhang Mingsheng of Lidu scored a goal in the first half. There were no goals in the second half. In the end, Lidu defeated China by 1 to 0 and won the Division Two championship. China was miserably eliminated, which was a pity. In the other two games, Fuhua and Paramount drew 3-3 in Division One. Beixi Tongquan was disqualified in the game against Shisheng. The Division Two game between Fuguang and Weiguang was postponed.</p>

<h3>Finance - Many Rumors - Cash Drops Then Rebounds - Hot Weather, Only Half-Day Trading, Volume Reaches 700 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold dark market only operated for half a day due to the recent hot weather and the fact that it was Saturday, when foreign exchange markets are closed. The situation was quite erratic, with fluctuations of 20-30 yuan at times. However, prices generally fell sharply first and then rose sharply. Initially, the bearish sentiment from the previous day persisted, and there were rumors of a firming foreign exchange market and some disquieting news. This increased pessimism, and cash dealers were eager to sell, constantly offering gold. Some money changers also started selling. Although some gold dealers absorbed the selling on behalf of speculators, their efforts to push prices up were limited. As a result, the market trended downward, breaking through the 2,500 yuan mark and briefly falling to a low of 2,485 yuan. Subsequently, news broke that exchange drafts had fallen back to 80 yuan, and there were rumors of a 50 million yuan currency issuance. This stirred the market, and buying interest suddenly rose, pushing prices up repeatedly. The price soared by 75 yuan, returning to above 2,500 yuan and reaching a peak of 2,560 yuan. Eventually, some money changers sold to realize profits, causing a slight pullback. The market closed at 2,550 yuan, down 12 yuan from yesterday's close. Trading volume was still active at 700 taels. Gold jewelry also initially fell and then rebounded, ending down slightly at two yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Falls Again by Twelve Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened at 2,532 yuan due to expectations of continued strength in foreign exchange and bearish sentiment. Cash dealers sold 50 taels to jewelers at an average price of 2,530 yuan. At the time, rumors were rampant in the market, and cash dealers continued to sell. However, some Yu-numbered dealers took the opportunity to push prices up and absorb the selling on behalf of speculators. Cash dealers sold 50 taels to some gold dealers at a price of 528 yuan. Subsequently, cash dealers sold another 90 taels to some gold dealers at a price of 520 yuan. Later, some money changers also started selling, selling 50 taels to some gold dealers at a price of 515 yuan. Shortly thereafter, cash dealers sold another 50 taels to some gold dealers at a price of 510 yuan. At this point, some gold dealers stopped buying and observed the market, causing it to weaken further and break through the 500 yuan mark. Jewelers sold 50 taels to some money changers at a price of 495 yuan. The market quickly fell another ten yuan under selling pressure, and money changers traded 50 taels at a price of 485 yuan, the lowest price of the day. Afterwards, sellers gradually disappeared, and news broke that exchange drafts had fallen sharply, breaking through the 100 yuan mark. At that time, 1,000 yuan only yielded 80 yuan. Also, favorable rumors prompted buyers to rush in to snap up gold at low prices, pushing the price up by 45 yuan in an instant. Money changers bought 50 taels from securities dealers at a price of 530 yuan. Then, some money changers sold 20 taels to cash dealers to realize profits at a price of 525 yuan. Shortly thereafter, some money changers sold another 50 taels to their peers at a price of 530 yuan. Sellers became even scarcer, and another money changer, acting on behalf of a wealthy client, was eager to buy, pushing prices up another 30 yuan. Money changers (acting on behalf of wealthy clients) bought 50 taels each from jewelers and peers at a price of 560 yuan, the highest price of the day. Although the wealthy client's buying interest remained strong, some money changers sold to realize profits, causing the market to pull back slightly. Money changers traded 50 taels with each other at a price of 555 yuan. At 11:45, money changers traded another 50 taels with each other at 2,550 yuan, which was the afternoon closing price. In the afternoon, due to the hot weather and the fact that it was Saturday with no foreign exchange market, dealers decided to close the market for half a day. As a result, the market closed down 12 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 75 yuan in half a day. Cash dealers' benchmark gold was priced 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price. Current marked gold was around 50 cents lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were few trades.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Also Initially Falls and Then Rebounds</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold jewelry was initially 260 yuan per tael at Da Tonghang. At 10:15, due to news of spot gold opening lower, it also fell by a small three yuan. At 10:55, because spot gold had broken through the 500 yuan mark, it fell sharply by another four yuan. Later, at 11:50, due to spot gold rebounding by 60-70 yuan, it also rebounded by five yuan. In the afternoon, because the spot gold market was closed, there were no changes. The final result was a decrease of a small two yuan. Da Tonghang changed its price to 258 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was 257 yuan, buying in at 250 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>A London dispatch on the 23rd stated that British pure gold did not change due to the stability of the pound. The price remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce. As a result, the central bank's purchase price of Chinese cash also remained at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed Customs gold also remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, and 9 li. The standard price for Shanghai floor gold also remained unchanged at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>No Special Changes in Foreign Exchange - Bank of Japan Continues to Sell, Situation Remains Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. In the dark market, although foreign firms were still busy settling accounts, foreign banks were eager to sell, and the Bank of Japan (Yokohama Specie Bank) also continued to sell large quantities, causing the situation to remain loose. However, there were no special changes in half a day, and trading volume was still active. Hong Kong exchange rates also remained loose due to strong selling by foreign banks.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London Telegraph was quoted at 1.875 higher, New York bank was stable, and London raw gold also did not change. Exchange rates for the pound against the dollar, against Shanghai, and against France were all flat. The dollar against the pound was unchanged, against Shanghai increased by 5 points, and against France increased by 0.0625. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The banks' opening selling prices for spot were 6 shillings and 6.875 pence for the pound and 13.09375 yuan for the dollar, flat for the pound and up 0.03125 for the dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, the Bank of Japan continued to sell spot pounds at 6 shillings and 7.5 pence to foreign banks such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank. Then, foreign banks resold spot pounds at 6 shillings and 6.875 pence to foreign firms. The market slightly firmed up. When HSBC announced that the exchange rates were unchanged and the silver balance was revealed to be 1 point, levied at 1.75%, foreign firms rushed to settle accounts with HSBC and Banque Franco-Chinoise for spot pounds at 6 shillings and 6.875 pence and 7.5 pence. Then, they settled spot dollars with American banks at 13.125 yuan. Near noon, trading in both pounds and dollars slowed down, but there were some trades in Hong Kong dollars. Foreign banks such as Banca Italiana per la Cina and Netherlands Trading Society successively sold to foreign firms at a spot price of 45.25 yuan, and the situation also firmed up. By the afternoon close, the banks' selling prices for spot were 6 shillings and 7.5 pence for the pound and 13.1875 yuan for the dollar, up 0.0625 for the pound and 0.125 firmer for the dollar compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange rates, calculated based on the transaction price, were also cheaper by 0.025. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Trading in British and American Gold Notes Resumes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were settling accounts at a high rate, and foreign banks were continuously supplying funds. The Bank of Japan needed fiat currency and released a large amount of British exchange, leading to a looser market situation. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6 shillings and 7.5 pence, an increase of 0.0625 from the previous day. The American exchange rate was 13.1875 yuan, an increase of 0.125. There was no market on Saturday afternoon. Spot gold opened lower due to the loosening of foreign exchange, and gold dealers and money changers supplied a large amount of gold, pushing the market price down to 32 yuan. Later, rumors were rife, and the market situation became even weaker, falling to 2,485 yuan. Gold dealers took the opportunity to buy at low prices, and the discount rate decreased, making it possible to seize cash and increasing buying interest. The afternoon close was 2,550 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 12 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no trading in the afternoon. Demand for British and American gold pounds resumed, and the supply was still smooth, keeping market prices stable. Trading in British and American gold notes was quite active. Due to limited supply, market prices were firm. Demand for French franc notes, Singapore notes, and Dutch guilder notes was low, and prices declined. Demand for Japanese gold notes was high, and market prices rebounded. The evening price was 9 jiao, 7 fen, and 1 li. The market for Korean notes was stable at 8 jiao and 6 fen. There was little trading in the association. Yongfeng sold 1,000 yuan of American gold notes to Shixiang, and Houji sold 50 pounds of British gold notes to Tongyuan. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold notes up 1 jiao, American gold notes up 2 fen, French franc notes down 2 li, Singapore notes down 5 fen, Dutch guilder notes down 1 jiao, Philippine notes up 5 fen, and other currencies unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Continues to Fall by Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts and bills gradually stabilized, falling from 100 yuan to 80 yuan per thousand yuan. However, in the afternoon, it suddenly rebounded by 10 yuan to 90 yuan, 10 yuan lower than the previous day. Interbank lending rates remained unchanged at 2 jiao and 5 fen in both the morning and afternoon.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Market Conditions are Firm</h3>
<p>A London dispatch on the 23rd stated that the silver market saw buying from India and selling from speculators. Trading was light, and market makers were flat. After closing, market conditions were firm. The public was buying at 0.0625 above the listed price, but sellers showed no intention of supplying. Both near and far-term silver futures increased by 0.1875. A New York dispatch stated that the American spot market remained stable. A Bombay dispatch stated that the Indian silver market conditions were firm, with spot and July futures increasing by 9 annas and August also increasing by 7 annas.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the New Restriction on Withdrawals</h3>
<p>Recently, in view of the fact that since the tightening of the Shanghai foreign exchange dark market, the general bourgeoisie and speculators have been competing to purchase foreign exchange, and foreign banks have been absorbing credit loans due to cash position issues, the Ministry of Finance believes that this has led to a situation where near-term rates are low and far-term rates are high in the foreign exchange dark market, and the interest rate spread is as high as several points. Therefore, the amount of funds flowing into foreign banks has been alarming recently. If appropriate measures are not taken, the funds of Chinese commercial banks in this city will inevitably be depleted. In order to prevent capital flight and stabilize the Shanghai financial market, the Ministry of Finance has adopted the restriction on withdrawals measure from a telegraph, limiting cash withdrawals to 500 yuan per week for ordinary fiat currency depositors, while interbank transfers in this city and transactions with other ports outside Shanghai will still be handled according to the old method and will not be subject to the new regulations. Moreover, the banking and money industries in this city convened an emergency meeting on the 22nd to establish seven implementation measures, which have been disclosed in various newspapers. It can be seen that the purpose of this decision to restrict withdrawals is to limit the flight of large amounts of fiat currency deposits from Chinese commercial banks, and it has no impact on small savings deposits. The fact is very clear. However, because depositors did not understand and mistakenly believed rumors, it was reported that from the 22nd to the 24th, a run on current accounts occurred in various banking and money industries in this city. Banks were crowded with people, and those withdrawing money were very congested, with most of them being small depositors withdrawing only a few dozen or a hundred yuan each. According to reports, the larger banks paid out a total of 100,000 or several hundred thousand yuan in cash each day for three days, and some even paid out up to one million yuan. It is hoped that all sectors of this city will explain the truth about the Ministry of Finance's telegraph to the public and not believe rumors or fall for the tricks of villains, which would shake the city's financial system. Furthermore, in this unusually hot weather, depositors should not withdraw cash from banks unless it is urgently needed, and keep it at home. This will alleviate the shortage of cash in the market and prevent financial instability. Secondly, it is important to know the risks of hiding valuables. The banking and money industries in this city will definitely not stop paying out small deposits, so the public should remain calm and avoid being deceived by speculators and villains. As can be seen from the recent loosening of the foreign exchange dark market and the decline in the gold market, rumors are not credible. (Ying Jun)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Because foreign banks are not bound by the orders of the Ministry of Finance and pay cash to Chinese and foreign depositors in full, this further motivates those with funds to flee abroad, which is a major concern!</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Spot Yarn Dark Market Opens Yesterday - Selling Price Falls More Than Before the Holiday - Payment Procedures Not Yet Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance's telegraph arrived in Shanghai, all banks and firms have followed the regulations, and the market trend has become much calmer. The spot yarn market had been closed for two days. Today, many people arrived to inquire about news. Although the number of people attending the meeting was smaller than usual, customers came to the meeting to make some purchases. Dark market trading has begun, and people's opinions vary. It is reported that Guangdong and Lingnan firms purchased one or two hundred bales of 20-count and 10-count coarse yarn. The market price for 20-count special Jin Cheng yarn initially traded at 505 yuan, the price for Double Earth yarn was 455.5 yuan, and the price for 20-count Shepherd yarn was 390 yuan, more than 10 yuan lower than the price before the Dragon Boat Festival. Several dozen bales were traded. In an instant, a certain firm sold 30 bales. The price of Ai Di Qiu yarn suddenly fell by 15 yuan to 440 yuan. Shepherd yarn also fell by 10 yuan to 380 yuan, and special Jin Cheng yarn was 495 yuan. The counteroffer for 20-count Double Horse Guang was 470 yuan, but the buyer's position was firm, and no agreement was reached. At 11:00, many shouted 480 yuan for 20-count Bian Ma yarn, but no one was willing to buy. In the afternoon, sentiment slightly improved, and there was also favorable news. The price of 20-count Shepherd yarn rose again, trading at 392 yuan. Double Earth yarn traded at 455 yuan, and 20-count [unclear] traded at 492 yuan, with seventy to eighty bales traded. The outcome will have to wait until Monday. All of the above transactions were conducted according to the old rules without any changes. It is reported that Chinese factories used to calculate 30% of sales as drafts and 70% as exchange transfers, but now they will increase the drafts by 10% and ship goods only with full drafts. This matter has not yet been decided, and the situation remains complicated with many uncertainties. Some say that the old method will probably be used, but Chinese factories may change their sales method to full drafts in the future. In the afternoon, the Yarn Industry Association also convened a meeting of industry members, probably to discuss the procedures for trading Japanese yarn and payment issues.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Blows Away the Yellow Plum Rains - Pumping Water to Transplant Rice Seedlings... Farmers Suffer</h3>
<p>Entering the "mold" season is the rainy season in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. China has always adjusted the arrival of the rainy season to the bing day after the Mangzhong (Grain in Ear) solar term. Some say that this still cannot avoid the theory of the five elements. In fact, those who are now shouting to break superstitions simply do not understand what is superstition and what is not. Although China uses the lunar calendar, the 24 solar terms of the year actually follow the solar calendar, so the period around Mangzhong and the Summer Solstice is often the rainy season. However, the rainy season is most afraid of the southwest wind, which blows away the rain. The great drought of 1934 was precisely because the mold season blew the southwest wind early.</p>
<p>The southwest wind was called the "ship off wind" by sailors in the old days. In the days when Europe and Asia traded by sailboat, everything depended on the wind direction. When the southwest wind blew, ocean ships could sail to the Chinese coast, because ships sailing northeast must rely on the assistance of the southwest wind.</p>
<p>There is an old Chinese agricultural proverb, "Summer Solstice, southwest wind crosses the small bridge," meaning that if there is a southwest wind on the Summer Solstice, there will be a lot of rain in the future, enough to "cross the small bridge," indicating that the water level will rise very high. This may be because the Summer Solstice is during the rainy season. If it doesn't rain when it should, it will still rain eventually, and there will be a corresponding sign, so it has been passed down to this day.</p>
<p>"If you miss the yellow plum rains, you won't plant rice." Planting rice seedlings requires water, so you should take advantage of the yellow plum rainy season to transplant seedlings. If you wait until after the yellow plum season, it will be too late to plant, and you will have to pump water to plant, which is a double loss. However, if there is no rain during the yellow plum season, high-lying fields often have to be irrigated to plant seedlings, which greatly affects farmers. However, not having rain during the yellow plum season does not necessarily mean a drought. Whether there is a disaster or not still depends on the weather afterwards. Moreover, "drought is a line, flood is a sheet," so the sunny and dry weather during the yellow plum season truly makes farmers suffer by making them exert more effort, but it has little to do with the current food supply.

<h3>British Government Orders American Cotton - Worth Six Million Pounds Sterling in Exchange for Eighty Thousand Tons of Rubber</h3>
<p>The foreign cotton market, especially the New York cotton market, was quite buoyant yesterday. Dealers were all buying because of the passage of the Agricultural Relief Act. Reports from Liverpool and Bombay were good, causing the price of spot cotton in the South to become even more firm. At the same time, the British and American governments believe that cotton and rubber are important raw materials for wartime. The British government is willing to purchase six million pounds sterling of American cotton and exchange it for eighty thousand tons of British-produced rubber. According to the intentions of the two countries, if there is no war in the future, both parties are willing to store these easily obtained goods for seven years. The contract was signed in England yesterday, so all parties are very happy. As a result, the New York cotton market rose 14-15 pound-ons. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by a small rupee, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than ten pound-ons.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, it is difficult to find a suitable payment method for foreign firms, which is causing great confusion among all parties. Moreover, the number of goods arriving daily is increasing, and the wharves are congested due to excessive inventory. The managers are negligent due to the complexity of the work, so fires occur frequently at the wharves, causing great anxiety among all parties. Factories and dealers have been holding meetings daily to discuss solutions, and it is expected that a solution will be found soon.</p>
<p>The cotton market, which had been stagnant for two days, became stable yesterday due to the start of dark market trading in yarn. There was activity among dealers. A transaction was made among local cotton merchants for 100 bales of Fire Machine cotton at a price of 88 yuan, paid in cash and delivered at the wharf. The supply of cotton from northern Jiangsu has been relatively smooth recently. The number of goods arriving at the wharf included 1,461 bales of Tongzhou cotton.</p>
<h3>Securities - Foreign Debt Sees New Low Prices</h3>
<p>The London stock market quotations for Chinese foreign debt on the 23rd of this month (Friday) fell sharply again, reaching new low prices. Among the upper-tier bonds, the Sino-French American dollar (with seal) and the Rehabilitation English dollar bonds fell by 3 pounds each, with the former quoted at 19 pounds and the latter at 34 pounds. The English dollar bonds from the Anglo-German continuation loan and the Crisp Loan fell by 2 pounds each, with the former quoted at 50 pounds and the latter at 23 pounds. Among the lower-tier railway bonds, the Da Qing bond also fell by 3 pounds to a price of 15 pounds, and the Beijing-Shanghai bond fell by 2 pounds to a price of 18 pounds. The Tianjin-Pukou original continuation bond fell by 1 pound to a price of 12 pounds. There were no changes in the other bonds. The domestic debt market remained closed.</p>
<p>The stock market at the Zhongye Association was quiet yesterday, unlike the previous Saturdays, but the underlying trend was stable and firm. Trading was focused on Jardine Matheson shares, opening at 18.7 yuan and closing with a bid price of 18.9 yuan and an offer price of 19 yuan. Trading volume was not high. Trading in the other industrial stocks was quiet. A small number of Wheelock Marden shares were traded at 34.5 yuan (up half a yuan). Tramway shares were relatively firm at 41 yuan. The rubber stock market was stable with weak demand. The prices of Anglo-Chinese Plantations and Rubber Trust shares saw slight increases.</p>
<p>The stock market quotations for British Far Eastern companies in London on the 23rd of this month (Friday) saw a rebound in bank shares. Mercantile Bank shares rose slightly by 2 shillings and 6 pence to a price of 7 pounds, 2 shillings, and 6 pence. The HSBC London-registered shares rose by 3 pounds to a price of 80 pounds, and the Hong Kong-registered shares rose by 2 pounds to a price of 82 pounds. However, Kaiping Mines shares fell by 3 pence to a price of 17 shillings and 9 pence. There were no changes in the other stocks.</p>
<h3>Metals - British Steel Sheets Market is Quiet</h3>
<p>Prices Increase by Six to Seven Yuan</p>
<p>The market for British steel sheets has been quiet for a long time. Previously, due to the abundance of spot goods, standard prices had fallen at one point. However, since the tightening of foreign exchange, prices have risen sharply. Recently, due to the special circumstances in Tianjin, there is no urgent need for this product. Although there are some inquiries from Yantai and Qingdao, the quantity is very small. The factories and dealers on this street also have no intention of purchasing, so the market situation is quiet. Only a few dozen loads were traded yesterday. However, prices have risen by six to seven yuan compared to the previous market. For example, 5 li and 7.5 li are selling for 25 yuan, 1 fen is selling for 20 yuan, 1.5 fen is selling for 19 yuan, and 2 fen is offered at 18.5 yuan (unit per market load).</p>
<h3>Grains - Four Dealers Disappear - Rice Prices Fall by Two to Three Jiao</h3>
<p>The source of Du Geng [glutinous rice variety] from various dealers has stopped. There are no arrivals from Hexia. There are over two thousand packages of "Wheel Bun" rice from Changzhou Nan, however. After the Two Publics Bureau issued an order limiting high-grade glutinous rice to 21 yuan and white pointed rice to 17 yuan, national dealers have disappeared. Only shops on this street have slightly increased their purchases. However, due to financial conditions, there are very few large-scale transactions, so the situation is weak. The market has fallen. As a result, the prices of thick and thin glutinous rice vary depending on the quality, falling by two to three jiao. Du Yang pointed and customer pointed also fell by two jiao or more.</p>
<p>Sticky Rice - Limited outlets, but because the price is close to glutinous rice, dealers are unwilling to lower it further, resulting in a stable situation.</p>
<p>Ke Xian [rice variety] - Yesterday the market had returned to normal. There were inquiries from both domestic and foreign dealers. However, due to the cash shortage and price limits, the market has been suppressed by two to three jiao. Domestic dealers sold over seven hundred packages of crushed rice from Jiangsu, with prices ranging from 15.7 yuan to 15.5 yuan. Dealers on this street sold one thousand three hundred to four hundred packages of Jingwu rice from Anhui, with high-grade priced at 17 yuan and middle-grade priced at 16.5 yuan and 16 yuan. Selling prices were all within the price limits, and inventory was abundant. There are still over 300,000 packages in Shanghai, and the supply continues uninterrupted. The market may gradually stabilize. However, according to news from Anhui merchants, the current price in Anhui has risen, making it difficult to supply in the future.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Quiet - Taicang New Wheat at 6.7 Yuan</h3>
<p>The market for prepared flour continues to be quiet. Because it is the weekend, and the factory has changed to 4 yuan, 8 jiao, and half the cash price, they are temporarily refusing to negotiate exchange transfer prices, so transactions with customers remain effectively suspended. There are only small wholesale transactions of 30 to 50 packages or 100 to 200 packages on this street. The market remains unchanged in this environment. The general expectation is that the official market will only reopen after the financial issues stabilize.</p>
<p>New wheat supplies have been arriving in small quantities along the Hu Ning Road area for several days. In the midst of the current cash shortage, the market had become stagnant. Yesterday, there were slight inquiries from this street, with over two hundred packages of Taicang new wheat offered at 6.7 yuan. A lively market may still have to wait.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw White Recovers Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight increase due to Dutch telegrams.</p>
<p>July/August was quoted at 8.60 Dutch guilders, September/October at 8.30 Dutch guilders. London telegrams showed a slight decline: August was down 0.75 at 7 shillings, 3.5 pence; December down 0.25 at 6 shillings, 2.5 pence; March of next year down 0.5 pence at 6 shillings, 3 pence. The local guild’s prices continued to recover slightly. Spot prices were 24 yuan for raw white, 29 yuan at this company, 28.8 yuan at other companies, and 20.8 yuan for transit cargo (200 bags). Bonded goods were 20.5 yuan (400 bags), up a little 0.45 yuan. Taikoo refined white B mark was up a little 0.2 yuan, with 100 bags traded at 28.6 yuan. Jardine Matheson’s red mark was 18.6 yuan (100 bags). There was little change in the price of Dutch red sugar spot, up 0.2 yuan to 20 yuan, transit cargo was 14 yuan. The national product was still quoted high and there were no real transactions. Due to sales and exchange considerations, prices are bound to rise.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Summer Fabrics and Woolens - Sales are Uneven</h3>
<p>Sales of summer fabrics and woolens have been mostly retail lately, with few wholesale transactions. This is partly due to limited actual sales, with goods being sold as soon as they arrive, partly due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, leading to sellers wanting to raise prices, and partly due to customer demand having stopped, relying only on local customers.</p>
<p>Paris: The sales of Chinese clothing trimmings at the door-front stores are wider than those of Western-style clothing trimmings. The standard market price initially rose, but later, due to the abundance of national products from Yinfeng, and the continued arrival of goods from Hong Kong that had been detained, the market trend became stable. Recently, sellers have wanted to raise prices, but buyers say that actual sales are over, leading to a stalemate.</p>
<p>Feather Yarn Wool: This summer, striped patterns are the most popular, followed by small checks. Plain colors are less popular. Most of the Western goods have already been sold out. Jardine Matheson’s woven goods, especially Western-style suits, are selling quite well, as they are only priced at a little over 5 yuan per yard, making them extremely popular.</p>
<p>Wanliding: This has become very popular recently, with beige and evergreen being particularly popular. British-made goods are often out of stock. The standard price has jumped by more than half a yuan. There are no domestic products, and Eastern goods are thin and contain artificial wool, so buyers use them less.</p>
<p>Baleni and Panbiequ: Both are selling well, but fashionable stripes are more popular, while plain colors sell less well. As a result, prices vary in strength. Most depend on the pattern. The higher the grade and the better the goods, the faster they sell.</p>
<p>White Drill and White Zhigong: White drill is selling briskly, but British-made goods are scarce and expensive. Eastern goods are plentiful but cannot rise in price. The trend for white zhigong is better than that for white drill. Most British-made goods must be sold for more than 10 yuan. Yongxing Hongkang and Shenzhi products are mostly lower grade and have small flaws, so they cannot replace the sales of the better qualities.</p>
<p>Yarn Linen Tarpaulin: Tarpaulin was initially in short supply and the price rose, but later, other companies brought in goods, and small domestic factories also produced goods, causing prices to fall. Now, due to exchange rate issues, prices have begun to rise again by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Imports of Eastern yarn and canvas are down by two-thirds compared to previous years, and prices are rising. Domestic products are selling very well. Yesterday, the best quality was selling at 0.85 yuan, and the second quality at 0.78 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Jellyfish Head Skin Sells Well</h3>
<p>Jellyfish is a cold food that does not need to be cooked. It becomes more crisp the longer it is aged, and it is clean and hygienic, making it ideal for summer. Therefore, sales have been quite brisk recently. The current market price for two-year-old jellyfish skin is 17 yuan per picul, compared to 14 yuan last year. Jellyfish head is 12.5 yuan. The trend is stable.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Honeysuckle is in Season, Sales are Slow</h3>
<p>Honeysuckle is said to clear the qi and blood and dissipate carbuncles. It is considered a sacred medicine for external diseases. The summer season is usually the peak sales period. However, current market inventory of aged honeysuckle is still large. New goods have recently arrived from Chongqing, about 7-8 pieces. However, sales are not very brisk, so the current selling price is only 60 yuan per picul.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Goods from Wenzhou are Quite Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, goods from Wenzhou were quite brisk, with 7,260 pieces of wood panels, 200 pieces of leather oil, 1,220 pieces of fresh eggs, 69 pieces of tobacco leaves, 30 pieces of tea oil, and 1,228 pieces of tea leaves arriving. There were also 10,600 pieces of charcoal. In addition, 800 pieces of sunflower fans arrived from Hong Kong, 22,640 pieces of bean cake from Yantai, and 2,800 bags of fertilizer were shipped to Ningbo on the 20th.</p>
<p>April: Changes in Shanghai Industry and Commerce (Continued from May 29th)</p>
<p>— Hui</p>
<h3>Changes in Industry and Commerce in May</h3>
<p>The total number of changes in Shanghai industry and commerce in May was 183, a decrease of 19 from April. The nature of these changes is explained below:</p>
<p>New Openings: There were 46 new openings, an increase of 5 from April, including 4 factories and 42 businesses.

<h3>Actively Adjusting Finances to Stabilize the Market: Please Provide Legal Tender as Much as Possible. The Banking Industry Telegraphs the Ministry to Instruct the Four Banks to Comply. All Industries Eagerly Hope for Additional Measures</h3>
<p>Following the Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram on restricting the payment of deposits, in addition to complying, the banking industry telegraphed the Ministry yesterday to instruct the four banks to provide legal tender as much as possible. Yesterday, they also received a telegram from the Ministry, clarifying that the restriction measures apply to Shanghai only. All industries still hope for supplementary measures. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Sends a Different Telegram to Shanghai</p>
<p>After the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications received the Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram (22nd), they immediately notified the banking industry to comply. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the banking industry received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, with content similar to the Ma Telegram, but stipulating that the restriction measures apply only to Shanghai. The ports outside of Shanghai, however, shall still comply with the Measures for Stabilizing Finance issued by the Ministry on August 16th, 1937, and the Supplementary Measures for Stabilizing Finance approved by the Ministry on August 17th, 1937, namely that the number of withdrawals per week shall be 5 percent, but the maximum amount shall not exceed 150 yuan per week.</p>
<p>The Telegraph Department Maximally Supplies Legal Tender</p>
<p>In addition to issuing a notice to comply, the Shanghai Banking Industry Association jointly decided on seven response measures. All banks and money shops are now complying. In order to adjust the market’s legal tender balance, yesterday, the two associations jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank to supply legal tender to their peers as much as possible, so as to facilitate transactions and avoid financial stagnation. It is said that the Ministry of Finance has agreed to the banking industry’s request to continue to provide legal tender as much as possible for legitimate needs.</p>
<p>All Industries Request Remedial Measures</p>
<p>Given that the Ministry of Finance’s restriction on withdrawal measures is the only important strategy for stabilizing finance in Shanghai, all industries have expressed their unanimous adherence to implementing the government’s wartime financial policy. However, all industries need legal tender for legitimate uses such as purchasing raw materials, and they hope that the Ministry of Finance will introduce supplementary measures to facilitate continued production and maintain the livelihood of workers. It is said that certain industries have written to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to request the Ministry to deliberate, hoping that the authorities will understand the difficulties of businesses and quickly promulgate remedial measures.</p>
<p>Market Stabilizes, Speculation Decreases</p>
<p>Since the Ma Telegram and the Different Telegram successively arrived in Shanghai, people’s hearts have been at ease, rumors have subsided, and bank withdrawals have decreased compared to before. All speculative activities, such as cash, cotton yarn, miscellaneous grains, flour, soybeans, rice, securities, foreign exchange, etc., have greatly decreased in transaction volume due to the lack of cash balance, and the market is turning towards stability. Various prices are expected to fall soon due to the lack of speculative manipulation, which will benefit the livelihood of the citizens. This is truly a gift from the Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram. As for the foreign exchange discount rate, there is now an official market.</p>
<h3>Restriction on Withdrawals and Discounting Cannot Coexist. If Discounting is Allowed, There is No Restriction. Mr. Lan Ting's Comments on the Discounting System</h3>
<p>The Banking Industry Should Seek Fundamental Solutions</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper’s reporter interviewed Mr. Lan Ting on the recent Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram regarding the restriction on withdrawals. Mr. Lan expressed his emotions, which he had been holding back for a long time, with great enthusiasm, saying, "At this time, countless people are profiting from the national crisis. The Ministry of Finance’s Ma Telegram</p>
<p>Restricts Withdrawals</p>
<p>Because some people are buying foreign exchange, so this restriction measure is well-intentioned. However, Shanghai still has so-called discounting. He personally believes that if there is a restriction, there should be no discounting. If discounting is allowed, there is no restriction." He continued, "The purpose of discounting can be said to be mostly for speculation in foreign exchange. On one hand, you want to curb foreign exchange speculation, and on the other hand, you allow discounting, so it is difficult to effectively curb speculation. Or it can be said that discounting opens the door</p>
<p>to Manipulation</p>
<p>for these speculators. Now the government stipulates that national needs, charitable causes, and wage payments are not subject to the restriction on withdrawals. Then what is the need for discounting? He believes that as long as discounting exists, foreign exchange speculation cannot be eradicated. If there is no discounting in the market, prices will naturally stabilize, and the people’s lives can be stabilized. This important financial issue concerns the national economy and</p>
<p>the National Lifeline</p>
<p>It is very important to seek a thorough solution as soon as possible." Mr. Lan has witnessed the facts and feels uneasy, so he hopes that the financial community, the banking industry, and all citizens can recognize the greater good, sacrifice the lesser self, and seek a fundamental solution for the stability of the entire financial system.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Gradually Fall Back. Fixed Price Limit for Medium Quality Rice. Yesterday, the Rice Industry Groups Decided to Comply. Rice Transactions are All Settled in Cash</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the International Settlement and the French Concession have fixed the price limits for white keng and ke sin rice in order to maintain the people’s livelihood and stabilize prices, and have appointed supervisors to be stationed at the rice market to investigate and deal with those who exceed the price limits, the Qianhengyu Rice Store on Xinzha Road has already received a warning. The rice industry groups held a joint meeting yesterday and decided to set standard prices for medium quality rice. Market transactions have all fallen to the price limit. The Rice Management Committees of the two Concessions will hold a meeting on the 27th to discuss rice prices and facilitate the flow of rice. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Rice Industry Groups</p>
<p>The rice industry groups held a joint meeting at the market at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The attendees included Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang from the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, and Qu Zhenhua from the Rice Store Association, Yan Jiyun, Xia Zhengxiang, and Zhu Qiuiong from the South Helper Association, Jiang Shiya from the Rice Transporters Association, Zhang Songtao from the Rice Retailers Association, Cai Weixiang from the Broker Friendship Association, and Fu Qiangeng, Wang Tianchou, Gu Yisheng, and Zhou Zhibai from the Market Management Committee. The meeting was chaired by Fu Qiangeng, and recorded by Wang Zhanting. First, the chairman reported on the authorities of the two Concessions fixing the price limits for white keng and ke sin rice in order to maintain the people’s livelihood. However, although the prices of the various grades of rice have been stipulated to be reduced separately, it seems that the standard prices of the various grades of medium quality rice should be stipulated to facilitate transactions. Then, the standard prices were set (see the public notice). The meeting adjourned at 10:15 a.m.</p>
<p>Standard Prices for Medium Quality Rice</p>
<p>The Market Management Committee issued a public notice at the market yesterday, saying, "Recently, the representatives of the rice industry groups at the city’s rice market decided at a joint meeting that, in addition to the price limits set by the authorities, the prices of all grades of goods will be tentatively set as follows: (1) Top quality Xichang white keng: 21 yuan; (2) Suzhou, Kunshan, Changzhou, etc. white keng: 20.8 yuan; (3) Same grade rice: 20.6 yuan; (4) Special thin rice: 21 yuan; (5) Large market thin rice: 20.6 yuan; (6) Lower river special thin rice: 20.5 yuan; (7) Early rice: 20.2 yuan. The above are based on fresh rice as the standard. Those from last season should be adjusted accordingly. All expenses shall be handled in accordance with previous regulations. This notice."</p>
<p>Report Daily Sales Volume to the Authorities</p>
<p>The Soybean and Rice Market Management Committee issued a public notice stating, "In order for the British Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council to inquire about the total daily sales volume of the market, from now on, all businesses shall still fill out the forms with the daily sales volume and send them to the Association for compilation and reporting. The daily sales volume report forms can be obtained from the Association’s office. All businesses are expected to comply uniformly and not be negligent. If any hindrance occurs due to failure to report, this Association will not be able to guarantee protection. All businesses should pay attention to this."</p>
<p>Buy and Sell Each Other According to Price Limits</p>
<p>The rice market opened as usual at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Since the Soybean and Rice Association issued a public notice that all market transactions must comply with the stipulated price limits, the rice price in the market fell back yesterday morning. The prices of all grades of medium quality rice have also fallen to the price limit. People’s hearts have become stable and order has gradually improved. The Rice Management Committees of the two Concessions have scheduled a meeting for the 27th (Tuesday). It is said that the meeting will discuss (1) stabilizing rice prices, and all rice merchants must trade in accordance with the stipulated price limits; (2) making every effort to facilitate the flow of domestic rice.</p>
<p>Association Meeting Decides on Cash Settlement</p>
<p>The Soybean and Rice Industry Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. The attendees included Yu Bingwen, Chen Shide, Xing Zhigang, Yang Heqing, Zhu Zixiang, Zhu Xiangyun, Jin Zhaoyun, Yan Xiaoquan, Jiang Hongbin, He Xianggu, Wu Zisheng, He Quansheng, Huang Zhihe, Fu Qiangeng, and Chen Ziyi, totaling 15 people. Chen Ziyi was elected as the temporary chairman. First, the chairman reported that the Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent speculators from purchasing foreign exchange with cash and disrupting the financial system, has stipulated the restriction on withdrawals in the Ma Telegram in order to safeguard the financial market. How should this industry handle buying and selling? Please share your opinions, etc. After discussion, it was decided that since rice is related to the people’s livelihood and is of utmost importance, it should still be settled in legal tender as usual. At the same time, it was decided that future meetings will be held at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Public Notice to the Market for Uniform Compliance</p>
<p>After the Association reached a decision, it immediately issued a public notice at the market, saying, "Recently, the city’s financial system has been changed by order. All rice transactions completed before the 20th of this month should still be settled in cash, as stated in the public notice issued on the 23rd of this month. As for subsequent rice transactions, the price should still be paid in cash. This has been decided at the joint meeting of directors and supervisors. Therefore, this case is recorded and announced, and it is hoped that everyone will comply. This is a special public notice." In addition, the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association also posted the same public notice at the market.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Forcibly Land Again. There is Now Warfare in Dinghai. Japanese Troops Have Landed Several Times at Putuoshan, etc., But It Has No Impact on the Overall Defense of Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>The news that Japanese troops landed in Dinghai has aroused the attention of Zhejiang natives in Shanghai. However, only Japanese propaganda has been seen. Shanghai has not received direct telegrams from Dinghai. In addition, shipping between Shanghai and Dinghai has been cut off, so the situation is even more isolated. However, the Shanghai office of a certain shipping company in Shanghai received a telegram from a ship at 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. Because the ship was sailing between Dinghai and Ningbo, the telegram mentioned that there was warfare in Dinghai. The ship sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai yesterday morning, and when it arrived at the waters off Ligang, it went directly to Shipu and suspended its voyage to Dinghai. From this, it can be inferred that the situation in Dinghai seems to be uneasy. However, Dinghai is a cluster of islands, and there is no land connection to eastern Zhejiang, so even if there are changes, it is not worth emphasizing.</p>
<p>Japanese Propaganda on Landing News</p>
<p>Since the Japanese naval authorities announced yesterday morning that Japanese naval landing forces had forcibly landed on the Zhoushan Islands on the morning of the 23rd, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from related parties yesterday that the Zhoushan Islands (i.e., Dinghai County) are islands off the coast of Ningbo and Zhenhai in eastern Zhejiang, including Daishan, Putuo, Qushan, Dinghai, etc. The four sides are adjacent to the sea and are not important militarily. There are no troops stationed there after the war, and only the people’s self-defense forces and county government police maintain order. Japanese naval forces have landed several times at Putuoshan and other places, and then automatically withdrew. Daishan and Qushan were occupied by Japanese naval forces led by He Yin last month. However, they were attacked by Chinese guerrillas from time to time, so the office of the Japanese naval commander has now been moved to a warship. The president of the "Maintenance Association" of the mountain, Fei Gongzai, was killed by guerrillas on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Gaodeng Ship Telegrams on Warfare</p>
<p>As for Dinghai, because it is the seat of the county government, the Gaodeng ship of the German-owned Lulin Company sails between Ningbo and Dinghai, and commerce is more prosperous than in other parts of the county. The Dinghai Natives Association in Shanghai telegraphed the Dinghai County Government yesterday to inquire about the truth. Because wireless communication was interrupted, it was impossible to communicate. However, the Gaodeng ship sailing between Ningbo and Dinghai sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, saying that there is now warfare in Dinghai, which confirms that the Japanese naval forces that landed have encountered fierce resistance from the local government, militia, and police. However, because Dinghai is an island, the Japanese troops have landed, but it has no impact on the overall defense of eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Ningbo-Dinghai Shipping Suspended</p>
<p>The foreign ships sailing between Ningbo and Dinghai are the Gaodeng ship of the German-owned Lulin Company and the Tianbao ship of the German-owned Shi Yide Company. Now the Gaodeng ship has reported from Ningbo to Shanghai that there is warfare in Dinghai, but shipping has been cut off. It did not mention it. According to the observation of the shipping industry, if there is warfare in Dinghai, then the routes from Ningbo to Dinghai and from Dinghai to Shenjiamen, as well as from Dinghai to Shipu and Ninghai, whether by steamboats or sailboats, will inevitably be completely suspended. As for the Hana ship sailing between Shanghai and Dinghai, it has long been changed to sail to Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Ningbo Sail as Usual</p>
<p>The route between Shanghai and Ningbo and the route between Wenzhou and Shanghai have not been affected by the Dinghai incident. The foreign shipping companies continue to send ships as usual. The Deping ship of the Italian Zhongyi Company sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo at 4:00 a.m. yesterday, and arrived safely in Ningbo at 5:00 p.m. that evening. The Baoli ship of the Italian Yihua Company and the Feikang ship of the German-owned Lulin Company are scheduled to clear customs tomorrow and sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou the day after tomorrow. In addition to loading cargo, they also sell passenger tickets, but a reputable local guarantor is required.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Shantou Ships Sail as Usual</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired in the shipping industry, the shipping route between Shanghai and Shantou has not been interrupted. The foreign ships still sail as usual. For example, the Dashun ship of Jardine Matheson is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Shantou on the 26th (next Monday).</p>
<h3>Senior Postal Staff Continue to be Transferred</h3>
<p>Deputy Postmaster Transferred to Chongqing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration recently transferred a large number of senior postal staff to various places in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. They have already left. There are Chen Shengyang, head of the escort team, Bian Qianren, supervisor of the mechanic team, and Liang Shaolian, head of the foreign parcel team. It is now learned that Shi Yitang, the acting deputy postmaster and chief of the transportation section, has also been ordered to be transferred to Chongqing a few days ago. It is said that Mr. Shi is the most talented of the senior postal staff in Shanghai. This decision to transfer him is deeply regretted by his colleagues in the Shanghai Bureau.</p>

<p>Eulogy (Eulogy 1): On this, the twenty-fourth day of June in the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Local Associations Council, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai French Concession, the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the Shanghai Banking Association, the China General Association for the Relief of Women and Children, the National New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai National Medicine Association, the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Shanghai Frozen Seafood Industry Association, the Shanghai Medicinal Materials Industry Association, the Shanghai Western Paint Industry Association, the Shanghai Cotton Brokerage Industry Association, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association's Northern Branch Office, the Shanghai Rice Merchants' Market Management Committee, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, the Shanghai Sauce and Pickles Industry Association, the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, the Shanghai Chaozhou Sugar and Sundries Industry Association Organizing Committee, the Shanghai Dried Goods Industry Association, the Shanghai Northern Goods Industry Association, the Shanghai Fruits and Native Products Industry Association, the Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association, the French Concession Branch Office of the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association, the Shanghai Salted Fish Industry Association, the Shanghai Noodle Industry Association, the Joint Office of the Shanghai Chicken and Duck Trade, Huida Tobacco Factory, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Luxin Tobacco Company, Weili Han Company, Sino-French Pharmacy, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Kangyuan Canning Factory, Hengfeng Printing and Dyeing Factory, Yifeng Enamel Factory, American Asia Company's Deli Factory, Xinfu Trading Company, Greater China Rubber Company Limited, Renshe, Lunshe, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai Paper Industry Association, China Needle Factory, Central Cosmetics Factory, Minsheng Canteen, Wuxi Shanghai Association, Renyi Shan Association, and others, reverently offer simple sacrifices of coarse grain and wine, clear water and plain dishes, in tribute to the spirit of Mr. Cao Bingsheng, saying: Alas, heroes are made by the times, and the wise adapt to circumstances. Heaven endows talents for a purpose, but great talents are often envied by fate. If Heaven intended to create him, why did it allow him to be killed? This is the unkindness of fate. Oh, vast heavens, we knock but receive no answer. Life is like a dream, a bubble, a fleeting moment that quickly becomes a past trace. But when the coffin is sealed, merits and demerits are revealed. In his thirty years, Mr. Cao was diligent in learning and questioning, accumulating profound knowledge. He was kind and loving, making friends far and wide. He resolved difficulties like a skilled craftsman and identified and punished evil like the clear light in the Qin court. In his daily life, he was public-spirited and selfless, with merits and no faults. Yet, he sacrificed himself in the line of duty. Mr. Cao was blameless towards his family, friends, society, and the people. Therefore, his death is mourned by gentry, merchants, scholars, and workers, those who knew him and those who did not. Even his Western colleagues of many years wept for him. Human nature is generally the same, and how much more so for us, whose pillar has collapsed, leaving us without support. The smallest offering of duckweed and the shallowest water cannot repay his spirit. Everyone has one death, and one's words, actions, and deeds during life are all related to society and human customs. We often disregard them, but after death, when we recall them one by one, we realize the importance of the person, but the person cannot be revived. We look but cannot reach him, we think but cannot see him, yet his voice and appearance will forever remain in our hearts. Mr. Cao's body is no longer his own and will decay with the world, but in our hearts, we will always see Mr. Cao's lively spirit, just as when he was alive. Therefore, we know that cutting paper to summon the soul is a Taoist illusion, and preserving the remains is an artistic expression. Paper ashes flying like butterflies are a sign of faith. Buddha said that everything is created by the mind. Now, to ensure that this heart does not forget, we specially establish a school and name it after him, so that his memory will be eternally preserved. A model for humanity and a role model for society, only Mr. Cao can fulfill this. Murmuring streams, misty clouds, the spirit banner is in sight, come and receive this offering. May you enjoy it. (Eulogy 2): On this, the twenty-fourth day of June in the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Jin Tingsun, Jiang Yiping, Yao Zhaodi, Huang Dinghui, Zhang Nianxuan, Yao Yongyan, Cao Zhigong, Huang Zhenshi, Song Menghua, Xu Datong, Li Yun, Sun Du Yuesheng, Xu Jilü, Xu Xiaochu, Xiang Kangyuan, Pan Zhaobang, Tian Shujun, Yu Songyun, Zhang Qiyang, Qu Zhenhua, Cheng Tongsheng, Xue Gengxin, Hu Guoqiao, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Zhang Jinghu, Sun Hegao, Yang Zhixiong, Gu Shouxi, Zhang Yishu, Shen Boying, Yu Ziqing, Ge Futian, Liu Zhongying, Cheng Ziqing, Sun Xiangji, Guan Jiongzhi, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Caicheng, Xu Guanqun, Ding Jiwan, Fei Xizhen, Hu Yongqi, Wei Tinghua, Chen Zhigao, Long Jingyan, Chen Xuanzhang, Zhu Liangbi, Sun Daosheng, Pu Qiting, Huang Qianzhi, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Yao Huiquan, Yuan Jiahuan, Lu Gaoyi, Zhang Yi, Feng Zhizhong, Zhang Yichen, Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, Ling Youguang, Jin Weiwei, Yu Qiaqing, Huang Jinrong, Xue Dubi, Ji Yunqing, Xu Jinchun, Ma Honggen, Cai Hongsheng, Chen Fukang, Chen Yiting, Dai Chunfeng, Wei Dunyi, Long Xiaoyun, Liu Chunpu, Sun Choucheng, and others, reverently offer sacrifices of livestock and wine in tribute to the spirit of Mr. Cao Bingsheng, saying: Alas, death is an eternal separation, a divide between yin and yang. Philosophers say that although the body dies, the soul lives forever. Then, Mr. Cao must know of our public memorial. With Mr. Cao's profound knowledge, he could have created great deeds and achieved immortality. With his healthy body, he could have enjoyed happiness and lived a long life. This year, he was only thirty years old, bleeding within ten steps, killed by a bullet. Is this fate? Mr. Cao had a strong sense of responsibility from a young age and never neglected his duties. Why did this misfortune befall him? He sacrificed himself, but he was not guilty. In these difficult times, countless people have sacrificed themselves, but none are more deserving of mourning than Mr. Cao. Mr. Cao contributed to society and now departs forever. We regret that we cannot redeem him with a hundred lives. Mr. Cao has now left this world. Has he ascended to heaven or been reborn in the Pure Land? We are still lost in a dream. If Mr. Cao has knowledge after death, we hope he will come to us in a dream. Since ancient times, those who are born must die, and only those who are not born are immortal. Birth and death are common occurrences, but in these extraordinary times, Mr. Cao's responsibilities were great. Now, he has abandoned his duties and left us forever. This is our misfortune and also what Mr. Cao would not have wanted. We mourn at his coffin, our voices filled with sorrow. The world is vast and the future is dark. The empty building only saddens us that the crane has gone, and we only see swallows returning to the old fortress. Tears splash on the waters of the spring river, and sighs rise with the tide of the Huangpu River. The spirit banner flutters, come and receive this offering. Alas, how sad. May you enjoy it.</p>
<p>Words of Thanks: Mrs. Cao Bingsheng then delivered a thank-you speech, briefly saying, "Today, I am honored by everyone's attention in initiating this memorial service for Bingsheng. I am truly unworthy of it, but my gratitude to everyone's kindness is beyond words. People can die any day, but Bingsheng's death was tragic. I could also die, but who will manage Bingsheng's remaining property? Who will educate and raise the young children? I fear there is no one. Thinking of this, I can only silently endure the deep pain and resign myself to my bitter fate. Furthermore, Bingsheng's family situation is bleak, and seeking help is impossible. This is truly worrisome. Thank you all for your kindness."</p>
<p>Funeral Wreaths: Many funeral wreaths were sent by various groups. (Political Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council): "The spirit never dies." (Shen Bao): "A wise man has withered." (Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce): "He was able to be fully devoted to his duties in public and possessed great talent. He had a heroic posture at a young age, but how could he be taken so soon?" (Local Associations Council): "The world lacks capable officials, and suddenly, when the building was swaying, a poisonous hand was applied. Who will be the assassin? There are fellow heroes who will forever remember the deep injustice." (Banking Association): "He achieved benevolence and took righteousness."</p>
<h3>Safety Campaign Promotion Week Ended Yesterday; 500 Scouts Assisted with the Promotion, Showing Great Diligence; the Rickshaw Group Achieved the Best Results</h3>
<p>The Safety Campaign Promotion Week, initiated by the Shanghai Municipal Council, has been proceeding smoothly since the 18th. Yesterday was the last day.

Motorbikes, bicycles, and "collapsing carts" were less impressive.</p>
<h3>British Missionary in Shanghai Describes Japanese Military Search; Personal Experience of Rude Treatment; Chinese Coolies Were Most Affected</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that a British missionary (name withheld) arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin on Tuesday. He stated that most British people enter the Tianjin Concession via the Wanguo Bridge, as they do not have to stand in long lines behind Chinese coolies waiting for permission to enter. He arrived in Tianjin from Peiping on the morning of the 16th with only a small bag containing pajamas and shirts. The Japanese sentry, upon learning that he was British, led him into a small inspection room. The contents of the bag were dumped out for inspection. A Japanese officer in plainclothes demanded to see his passport and interrogated him. He then ordered him to undress.</p>
<p>He removed his shirt</p>
<p>and socks, but refused to remove his trousers unless he was allowed into the next room. The Japanese realized that he was not trying to hide anything and did not order him to remove his trousers. They then thoroughly inspected his clothing and papers in the bag. If he had not remained calm, an incident would have occurred. In his opinion, the Japanese officers were deliberately engaging in such hostile actions towards the British to provoke anger. If they resisted, they would be arrested for resisting a military officer. After the inspection, the contents of his bag</p>
<p>were thrown on the ground.</p>
<p>When he picked up his shirt and tried to dust it off, the Japanese officer in plainclothes punched him in the shoulder. The Japanese sentry also approached with a bayonet. He did not want to cause trouble and did not move. Then, another Japanese officer arrived and, after inquiring in English, helped him repack his bag and apologized on behalf of the others. He was only allowed to enter the concession an hour later. On Monday,</p>
<p>when he left the concession,</p>
<p>he was subjected to the same inspection. When asked if it was true that Chinese people did not want to enter the concession, he said that many Chinese people, mostly coolies, were gathered at the entrances trying to enter the concession. However, only four people were allowed to enter every twenty minutes. Therefore, the coolies were the most affected by the blockade, as they could not enter the concession to work and could not earn a day's wage. Two coolies could not wait any longer and tried</p>
<p>to swim across the river,</p>
<p>but they were both arrested. Although the consumption of milk in the concession was high, only a few Russians delivering milk were allowed to enter each day. There was an absolute shortage of vegetables. On the day he left Tianjin, foreigners had no meat to eat, as the meat that had been brought in before the blockade was not enough to be stored frozen, so it was believed to be unsafe to eat.</p>
<h3>Passenger Issues on Shanghai-Ningbo Liners</h3>
<p>Actual Number of Passengers Exceeded Two Hundred</p>
<p>Regarding the passenger issue on Shanghai-Ningbo liners, according to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Deping, which sailed to Ningbo yesterday morning, had no fewer than two hundred passengers who had guaranteed tickets. However, they were all legitimate merchants with medical certificates. The Moufu, which sailed to Ningbo yesterday, also carried about two hundred passengers, all of whom were legitimate merchants with guarantees, so there were no issues with landing. However, if the number of passengers exceeds the limit, there may be disputes, which merchants should be aware of.</p>
<h3>Financial Situation Stabilizing; Sir Otto Niemeyer to Visit China; Sir Charles Addis to Go to Chongqing from Hong Kong; Rumors of Song Ziwen's Visit to England Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that banking circles in Shanghai received news from Hong Kong yesterday (the 23rd) that Sir Otto Niemeyer, the British government's chief economic advisor, would soon be visiting China again, which caused great concern. It was also reported that Sir Charles Addis, chairman of the Sino-British Stabilization Fund Committee and of the Bank of England, would soon be going to Chongqing to discuss important matters with the Chinese government. After that, he is expected to leave for England. Banking circles in Shanghai believe that the rumored visit of Sir Otto Niemeyer to China is of particular significance due to the current restrictions on withdrawals from bank deposits. Banking circles in Shanghai also believe that new methods will soon be implemented for the sale and purchase of foreign exchange. Previous telegrams from Hong Kong predicted that Song Ziwen, chairman of the Central Bank, would soon lead an economic delegation to London. However, banking circles in Shanghai expressed doubt about the rumor of Song's visit to England, believing that Song was too busy with domestic affairs to make the trip. Banking circles also hinted that they frequently consulted with Song, as Song had considerable influence in banking circles.</p>

<h3>Investigation into the Responsibility for the Collision of the HSBC Vessel; Norwegian Consulate Investigating; Vessel Did Not Sink, Towed to Yantai; Part of Cargo Thrown Overboard</h3>
<p>The Norwegian vessel HSBC, chartered by the Fufeng Shipping Company on Jiangxi Road in Shanghai, departed from Shanghai on the 20th to Tianjin. On the evening of the 22nd, it encountered heavy fog near Weihaiwei and was struck by the Japanese vessel Kaiun Maru. All crew members were rescued. The company received a telegram yesterday stating that the vessel had not sunk and had been towed to Yantai. The Norwegian consulate is investigating the cause of the accident to negotiate with the Japanese side. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Vessel Did Not Sink Despite the Collision</p>
<p>The Fufeng Shipping Company received a telegram from the shipowner at about 8:00 AM on the morning before yesterday (the 23rd) regarding the accident involving the HSBC near Weihaiwei. They immediately telegraphed to inquire whether the vessel had sunk, but had not received a reply. A certain radio station received a report that the vessel had already sunk. The company received another telegram from the shipowner Danielsen at 8:00 AM yesterday morning stating that although the HSBC was severely damaged in the collision, it had not sunk.</p>
<p>Temporary Repairs and Towing to Yantai</p>
<p>The company received a telegram from the Kaiun Maru at 12:00 PM today stating that after the HSBC sent out a radio distress call, the Kaiun Maru and two other Japanese vessels, including the Zuitang Maru, did their best to rescue it. They plugged the damaged parts. The Kaiun Maru has now towed it to Yantai. However, part of the cargo has been thrown overboard. The HSBC will now enter the shipyard for repairs, and the cargo that was not thrown overboard has been unloaded in Yantai. All sixty-five crew members were rescued and arrived safely in Yantai. The shipowner will travel to Dalian with the Kaiun Maru.</p>
<p>Norwegian Consulate Investigating for Negotiations</p>
<p>A Dagong News Agency reporter learned from the company that the Norwegian consulate is investigating the responsibility for the accident to determine who should bear it. If the responsibility lies with the Japanese vessel, they will negotiate with the Japanese shipping company to claim compensation for all losses incurred by the ship and cargo as a result.</p>
<h3>Ye Huating Ordered to Fulfill Land Lease Contract</h3>
<p>Ye Huating, a local resident, leased a plot of land measuring one acre and two fen located at the intersection of Guanchang Road and Seymour Road, i.e., Block 144, District 12 North, Shangyi District, to Anbu Enterprise Company on November 15th of last year for the construction of houses. The lease term was twenty years, with an annual rent of 1,200 yuan per acre in national currency. The land and buildings were to be returned at the end of the term. It was stipulated that Ye Huating would be responsible for arranging tile pipes, connecting sewer pipes, and filling soil for the gully leading from the land to Seymour Road after receiving a deposit of 500 yuan. He was also to guarantee that there would be a road of at least fifteen feet wide at the entrance to Seymour Road. A receipt for the land lease deposit issued by Ye Huating served as proof. However, after receiving the deposit, Ye Huating delayed the filling work. Despite repeated requests, he evaded the issue and failed to comply. Anbu Enterprise Company hired lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jin Zhan to sue in the First Special District Court and petitioned for compulsory fulfillment of the land lease contract. After a trial presided over by Judge Mo Runhua of the Civil Court, the arguments concluded, and a verdict was rendered yesterday at 2:00 PM, ordering the defendant (Ye Huating) to fulfill the contract in accordance with the plaintiff's (Anbu Enterprise Company) request. The counterclaim filed by the defendant (Ye Huating) was rejected, and the litigation costs were to be borne by the defendant.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiters Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Counterfeit Bills Worth 7,200 Yuan Confiscated</p>
<p>On the 11th of this month, the Gordon Road Police, based on information from an informant, arrested Liu Jinkui and two other men from Shandong at the Huxi Hotel No. 13 on Carter Road and No. 15 Ciaan Lane on Lafayette Road for selling counterfeit currency of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. They confiscated 7,200 yuan of counterfeit bills found in a double-bottomed suitcase and brought them to the police station. Judge Jiang of the First Special District Court interrogated them and remanded them in custody pending sentencing. Yesterday morning, at the sentencing date, Judge Jiang presided over the Third Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought to the court for sentencing. Liu Jinkui was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for collecting counterfeit bills with the intention of using them. Liao Zhankui was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for jointly collecting counterfeit bills with the intention of using them. Yang Zijian, a recidivist, was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for collecting counterfeit bills. The 7,200 yuan of counterfeit bills and the double-bottomed suitcase were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Announces Blockade of Haimen; Foreign Vessels Ignore; Japanese Warship Shells Xingang; British Warship Docks to Protect</h3>
<p>The Japanese military recently announced to foreign shipping companies, citing military measures, that they intended to blockade the Beisha shipping route and prevent foreign vessels from sailing. However, according to the Dagong News Agency, the Taikoo Company's Wantong and the Far Eastern Company's Haiyi sailed to Beisha as usual, carrying passengers and cargo. The Jardine Matheson Company's Yihe sailed out the day before yesterday, stopping at various ports to load and unload passengers and cargo. A small warship dispatched by the Japanese Navy was docked near Songji Port, and armed motorboats patrolled the sea from time to time, but they did not take any action against foreign vessels. Regarding the occurrence of war in the area, a Dagong News Agency reporter inquired with passengers from Beisha, who said that at about 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship sailed to Xingang, a port downstream, and shelled Xingang Town. Two shells landed in the rice fields one mile outside the town and did not explode. The other two shells hit a tofu shop and a mill, destroying more than ten houses and causing a fire. An elderly woman and a young child were killed or injured. The Chinese army on shore did not retaliate. The Japanese warship then sailed away. A British warship is now docked in the sea area, reportedly to protect British vessels and maintain transportation between Shanghai and Beisha.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Li and Lin Lizhen Adultery Case Continued Trial Record: The Timing Issue Becomes the Focus of Dispute; Wife Requests Compensation of One Yuan</h3>
<p>Lawyer Li (also known as Li Shude), after falling out with his wife Shen Qiwen and forcing her to return to Ningbo, cohabitated with his lover Wang Liming (real name Lin Lizhen) in the attic of house number 65, lane 546, Tianliao Road. Although the residence was humble, requiring a movable bamboo ladder for access, they found joy in their sweet life. Alas, good times don't last. Recently, Shen learned of their affair and reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police. At dawn on the first of this month, Chinese and foreign detectives were dispatched to the address to:</p>
<p>Raid for Adultery</p>
<p>They apprehended the pair from the attic and took them to the police station. After questioning, they were released. Simultaneously, a public prosecution for adultery was filed against Li and Lin in the First Special District Court. A preliminary hearing had already taken place, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Fang Qinghuan convened a court session to continue questioning the two parties and witnesses. The defendant, Lin Lizhen (i.e., Wang Liming), was fashionably dressed and stood gracefully beside Li, showing no signs of illness, indicating her ailment had healed. According to her testimony, she is twenty-five years old this year and once worked as a:</p>
<p>Private Tutor</p>
<p>She has known Li for three years and cohabitated with him for two. Initially, she claimed she was unaware Li was married. In court, Shen Qiwen was questioned about a woman encountered in the Dingxiang Garden last July, whom Li escorted hand-in-hand. Shen replied that it was Lin. She also stated that the "affair" mentioned in her letters to Li did not refer to Lin. Although she had heard Li was seeing both Lu and Lin, she could not exercise her right to sue due to lack of concrete evidence, and there was no condoning or forgiving on her part. Afterwards, the court examined:</p>
<p>Lin's Testimony</p>
<p>She claimed that after cohabitating with Li, she encountered Shen on the street. Li then told her that Shen was his wife, but they were estranged, and Shen had moved back to her mother's home and would no longer interfere with his actions. She, Lin, had been cohabitating for a long time and repeatedly urged Li to get married, but he always made excuses. Therefore, she was helpless. Then, Zhu Changlin, a witness presented by Li, testified that before July 20th last year, he saw Li and Lin together in Dingxiang Garden, and then saw the plaintiff also arrive, and they were very aware of each other.</p>
<p>Li informed him</p>
<p>That she was his wife. However, he was not very clear on how many people the plaintiff was with that day. After Judge Fang finished questioning, he ordered the commencement of arguments. First, police lawyer Zhang Shizhu briefly recounted the facts of the case, emphasizing the key point of contention: when the plaintiff learned of the defendants' adultery – before or recently after the Dingxiang Garden encounter? He requested the court to use its discretion in rendering a judgment. Then, Li's defense lawyer, Feng Xizui, argued on Li's behalf that Shen Qiwen did not want to endure the pain of childbirth and, therefore, separated from her husband. She definitely condoned Li's cohabitation with Wang Liming beforehand and forgave him afterwards.</p>
<p>The current accusation</p>
<p>Is purely for money. Her intentions are clear from the conditions she previously proposed during mediation: continued separation, with Li providing 10,000 yuan in national currency and several hundred yuan in monthly living expenses. Lin also hired lawyer Wu Zhengwai for her defense. Finally, Shen's lawyer filed an incidental civil lawsuit against both defendants, requesting the court to order them to jointly compensate her for one yuan in damages. However, both defendants stated in court that they could not bear the responsibility for this one yuan loss. The court then adjourned to deliberate and pronounce judgment.</p>
<h3>Tranquility at Tushanwan</h3>
<p>According to someone from Tushanwan, the area is currently very tranquil. The report in the previous newspaper about the new Tushanwan police station increasing defenses was a misrepresentation. No new police station has been established in Tushanwan.</p>
<h3>Rihua Travel Agency Forges Epidemic Prevention Certificates; Three Japanese and Twelve Chinese Youths Arrested; A Young Man and Woman Were Stopped En Route to Qingdao</h3>
<p>Recently, a young man and woman planned to travel to Qingdao on a Taikoo Shipping Company vessel. When the person in charge of the vessel requested their epidemic prevention certificates, the pair presented certificates issued by the Rihua Travel Agency, a Japanese business located in rooms 16 and 18 on the second floor of 110 Sichuan Road. The vessel deemed these certificates invalid, requiring certificates from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department. The couple stated that</p>
<p>The certificate</p>
<p>Was purchased for over two yuan. They requested it be returned to seek reimbursement from Rihua and get vaccinated by the Municipal Council. The vessel's manager tore off the signature of doctor Wang Jifang from the certificate and returned the certificate. Afterwards, the company reported the torn signature to the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, which relayed it to the police department. The General Inspectorate launched an investigation. Chinese detective Fan Defu ordered Chinese detective Sun Minchang to on the 19th</p>
<p>Disguise Himself and Go To</p>
<p>The Rihua Travel Agency. He pretended to want to travel to North China and needed to purchase a ticket. He bought a ticket for twenty-six yuan and an epidemic prevention certificate and a smallpox vaccination certificate for four yuan. Sun had not actually received any vaccinations. He reported this, and on the 23rd, Chinese detective Yang Peisheng, along with Sun, Japanese detective Kobayashi, and other Western detectives, went to Rihua</p>
<p>Travel Agency And</p>
<p>Arrested eight Chinese: Zhang Wenbao, Zhang Luo, Yang Qincai, Zhang Yurun, Hua Anzhang, Ye Changnian, Huang Huide, and Huang Huiming, as well as three Japanese. Along with blank epidemic prevention certificates, they were taken back to the General Inspectorate. Later, at 230 Southern Hotel, 462 Jiulu Road, an affiliate was uncovered, and four more Chinese: Zhang Furong, Zhang Zhengrong, Wang Acai, and Huang Jintang, were arrested. More epidemic prevention certificates were also confiscated. Except for the three Japanese who were</p>
<p>Sent to the Japanese</p>
<p>Consulate, the remaining twelve Chinese were sent to the Special District Court's Fourth Criminal Division yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the situation and charged them with forgery. He requested an extension for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Dai Duo, he ordered them to be detained and await a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Husband Falsely Accuses Wife of Adultery; Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Pang Qingbao, the owner of Xiaoleyi Vegetable Restaurant on Zhejiang Road, previously set a trap to falsely accuse his wife Cao Fuzhen of adultery with his friend Lu Zhicheng in room 320 of the Far Eastern Hotel. He reported this to the Old Zha Police Station, who dispatched detectives to arrest Cao and Lu Zhicheng. They were sentenced by the First Special District Court to three months imprisonment each, with the option of paying a fine in lieu of imprisonment. Cao, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After a thorough investigation, the High Court found many doubts, indicating a deliberate false accusation. The original judgment was overturned, and Cao Fuzhen was declared innocent. The First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, considering Pang Qingbao's actions despicable, initiated an investigation by Prosecutor Song Genshan. Pang Qingbao was prosecuted for false accusation in the same level criminal court and was released on bail. The case has been heard once by the Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Peishen held a second hearing in the Second Criminal Court. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Jiang Baolian also appeared. After arguments, the court adjourned the case and scheduled a sentencing date. Pang Qingbao was ordered to increase his bail by 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Temperature Approached 100 Degrees; Heatwave Hits Shanghai; Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Overflowing</h3>

<p>Unbearable Heat</p>
<p>Last year, during the same period, the temperature was only 77.5 degrees. The heat this year is truly unprecedented. Moreover, a warm southwest wind continued last night. The heatwave may be difficult to dispel today. All of Shanghai is surrounded by the heatwave.</p>

<h3>Shooting of a Vietnamese Policeman Case; Three Suspects Released</h3>
<p>On the night of the 2nd of last month, at 11:00 PM, Vietnamese policeman Nguyen Tuan Tuo (transliteration) of the French Concession Police Department, number 522, was on duty at the intersection of Avenue Petain and Rue Bayan, when he was shot and killed. On the 10th of the same month, the police, based on clues, and in cooperation with the Public Concession Police, arrested three White Russians at Beijing Road and Hongkou: Gu Shijin Aimililao, Geli Mofu Fumi Guya, and Fa Xilang Gu Gemiguya. They were sent to the Second Special Court for questioning and detention. Yesterday afternoon, presiding judge Liao attended the First Criminal Court to examine the case.

The court, after reviewing the case, ordered the cancellation of the detention warrants for the three defendants and released them in court.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador and British Consul General Visit Nanshi Refugee Area</h3>
<p>Belgian Ambassador Baron Guillaume and his wife, along with British Consul General Phillips and his wife, visited the Nanshi refugee area at around 8:00 AM yesterday.

<h3>Shooting on Avenue Joffre Last Night; Victim Knew of Threat; Prepared Gun for Self-Defense but Failed; Dada Shipping Ticket Agency Located on the Bund</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoping (reported as Wang Shaoting yesterday), a Ningbo native residing at No. 6, Lane Lafayette on Avenue Joffre, operated a Dada Shipping Ticket Agency on the Bund. He was 44 years old. At 7:50 PM on the 13th, as he left home and waited at the bus stop at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet, suddenly an assailant approached from behind and fired a Mauser pistol at Wang's head,</p>
<p>Penetrating His Forehead</p>
<p>Wang fell to the ground and died instantly. The patrol police on the scene captured one assailant, seized the murder weapon, a Mauser pistol, and took him back to the police station for investigation. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Examination Office for autopsy. According to reports, the deceased had received news unfavorable to him, and thus obtained a license and purchased a self-defense pistol, which he carried with him to prevent accidents. However, at the time of the incident, the assailant approached from behind, so the deceased</p>
<p>Did Not Notice</p>
<p>Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Qian of the Second Special Court and a forensic doctor inspected the body. The investigating detective reported the progress of the investigation after the incident. The deceased's wife, Wang Xu (44 years old, from Suzhou), applied to claim the body for burial. The apprehended assailant was not yet sent to the court for trial as the police were still investigating. The official ruled that Wang Xiaoping died from a gunshot wound, and the body was released to Xu</p>
<p>Wang for burial. A Western officer from the police department came to the office, photographed the body, and examined the wound in detail to be used as evidence in future trials. After the procedure, the family prepared clothes and a coffin for burial. The name of the captured assailant is unknown, but the details should be released to the court for investigation tomorrow.</p>
<p>Furthermore, last night at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet, a Ningbo native Wang Shaopin (44 years old) was shot dead by a man. The man was arrested on the spot. It is now known that the man's name is Xu Ji, who admitted to shooting Wang. Wang's body has been inspected by the court and released to his family for burial. The police are thoroughly investigating the details of the case.</p>

<h3>Elderly British Woman Murdered; Room in Disarray Suggests Robbery</h3>
<p>The residence at 211 Rue de Saigon in the French Concession belonged to Toe Freeman, a British citizen and president of the pistol club. Freeman recently passed away two weeks ago. His elderly wife, 74 years old and still in good spirits, continued to live there alone. At approximately 6:30 AM yesterday morning, a Chinese maid entered the house to clean. She glanced at Freeman's wife, who was lying diagonally on the sofa with her hands and feet bound. Upon closer inspection, she was dead. The items in the room were in a state of disarray. The maid, terrified, immediately reported it to the police, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They took footprints to begin the investigation and reported it to the British Consulate to send personnel to examine the scene. Afterwards, it was speculated that Freeman's wife was strangled by burglars who broke into the house to steal. When Mrs. Freeman discovered them and called for help, she was attacked by the burglars.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at 9:00 AM yesterday, the 74-year-old British woman Mrs. Freeman, residing at 211 Rue de Saigon, was suddenly murdered in her bedroom by criminals who tied her hands and feet. Based on initial observations, the case appeared to be a robbery. The room's drawers were turned upside down and ransacked. It appeared the criminals were familiar with the elderly woman's routine and possessed a key to the room, as the police did not find any signs of forced entry. While the exact cause of the British woman's death is still undetermined, the primary cause seemed to be suffocation with a pillow. Currently, the British authorities in Shanghai and the French Concession Police are conducting a thorough investigation into the case.</p>
<h3>The Li Yongkuan and Sons Case Continued Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>Further Investigation Needed; Rescheduled for Trial</p>
<p>Li Yongkuan, Li Jia Zhou, and Li Bihua, three infamous salt smugglers from Anhui, formed a bandit gang in the Xihutang Ruanxiang area of Punan, Songjiang County, after the Nationalist army withdrew westward two years ago. They arbitrarily set fires, murdered, looted, and forcibly abducted Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian from Xihutang. They forced them to marry the two sons, namely Jia Zhou and Bihua. They also shot Lin's mother, buried her in a pit, and robbed the Lin and She families three times. Finally, they sold the Lin family's house to a local tyrant, Lu Baoren. After the regular army disarmed them, the Lis</p>
<p>Fled to Shanghai</p>
<p>They hid in No. 11, Zhongxing New Village, Ciyou Road, behind the Xujiahui Catholic Church. They confined Lin and She and restricted their freedom. On January 10th of this year, the two women seized an opportunity to escape and reported to the Sacred Heart Convent, which reported to the French Concession Police. The police arrested the Li father and sons and confiscated stolen goods from the Lin and She families, including gold bracelets, rings, and leather clothing.</p>
<p>After Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>They were sent to the First Special Court and indicted on charges of robbery and murder. Because the incident occurred inland, the Second Special Court requested the Supreme Court's Shanghai Special District Branch to designate the Second Special Court to handle the case. After Criminal Court President Liao repeatedly convened hearings, Li Yongkuan fell ill in custody, and the hearing was rescheduled. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the court convened another hearing. Li Yongkuan, supported by his two sons, Jia Zhou and Bihua,</p>
<p>Was Helped to Court</p>
<p>The victims' incidental civil lawsuit was represented by lawyer Xu Yannian, while the Li father and sons were represented by lawyers Xuan Zhenjun and Lan Xuzhang. The court summoned the plaintiffs Lin Xiuhua and She Yuexian to detail how they were kidnapped, forced into marriage, and how their families were robbed. The defendants, the Li father and sons, vehemently denied the kidnapping, claiming that it was</p>
<p>A Formal Marriage</p>
<p>Judge Liao conducted the inquiry for half an hour. Due to the case still requiring further investigation, he announced that the hearing would be rescheduled for July 13th at 8:00 AM. Li Yongkuan's lawyer requested bail, but the court denied it due to the seriousness of the case and ordered him to be remanded to custody.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Opium Dens General Strike Yesterday; Protest Against Increased Taxes</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, hundreds of opium dens in the "Tsu-Tu" area of Shanghai West went on a general strike today (June 24th) to protest the "Great Way" police arresting thirty den owners and smokers, enforcing the new regulations of the "Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau" (established only a week ago) by the "Renovation Government." The sudden closure of the dens has created a serious situation among addicts without their own smoking sets. Many addicts, unaware of the strike, went to the area and returned disappointed. Some even stood in front of the doors of the closed dens, yawning and stretching as their addiction kicked in. This dispute began a few days ago when the "Director of the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau," Yu Zhongqing (transliteration), set up an office in the Broadway Mansions and sent a letter to all opium dens, requiring them to re-register and pay taxes according to the new regulations. He then sent another notice, ordering them to comply with the new regulations within three days. The opium dens ignored the notices. The "Shanghai Anti-Smoking Bureau," with the cooperation of the "Great Way" police, went to enforce its regulations yesterday (June 23rd) at 6:30 PM. In the "Little Moon Palace" and "One Four Five Six" opium dens in Xinkang Lane near Connaught Road, more than thirty den owners and smokers were arrested and are still in custody. It is said that the arrested den owners were hired imposters to prevent their own arrests. Other den owners, upon hearing the news, decided to go on a general strike to protest what they called "high-pressure tactics." It is believed that the "Anti-Smoking Bureau" is now planning to implement a new tax rate based on the number of opium pipes. The "Anti-Smoking Bureau" has promised better protection for opium dens to prevent extortion after the new tax rate is implemented. The den owners are reportedly skeptical of this promise. Today's strike not only affects opium but also the trade of red pills and white powder, as most opium dens sell all three drugs.</p>
<h3>Zhaofeng Park Brass Band Concert</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Band is scheduled to hold a brass band concert at Zhaofeng Park this month on the 25th from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM (weather permitting). The program includes seven items.</p>
<h3>Tragedy at Asia Hotel; Husband Angrily Kills Wife; Hu Wu Suffers Fourteen Knife Wounds</h3>
<p>Two people who appeared to be a married couple checked into room 148 of the Asia Hotel at 571 Hankou Road. At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a tea server at the hotel heard cries for help from the room. He immediately opened the door and saw the woman covered in blood, injured and lying on the floor. He urgently reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to the scene and arrested the man inside the room. It was discovered that the woman had been stabbed as many as fourteen times. The man arrested, claiming to live at No. 3 Wangzhi Road in the French Concession and surnamed Hu, confessed that the injured woman was his wife, Hu Wu, 23 years old. His remaining statement was evasive. The police are currently investigating the case.</p>
<p>Robbery in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>Near the corner of Sichuan Road and Nanjing Road near Hall and Holtz, at approximately 11:50 AM yesterday, a man was walking when two assailants chased him from behind. One assailant brandished a pistol and threatened him, resulting in 500 yuan in national currency being stolen from his pocket. The robbers fled with the loot. Furthermore, at 503 Connaught Road in Shanghai West at approximately 6:30 AM yesterday, six assailants broke in, three of whom were carrying pistols. They ordered everyone to be silent. As a result, watches, cash, and clothing were stolen, totaling 90 yuan.</p>
<p>Waiter Fell and Injured</p>
<p>Shen Lianggen, 37 years old, a local, worked as a waiter at the Yibing room on the seventh floor of the Sincere Company on Nanjing Road. At approximately 11:30 AM yesterday, Shen was sweeping the room when he accidentally fell, rolling from the seventh floor to the sixth floor, severely injuring his head. An ambulance was called to rush him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Refugee Injured While Delivering Goods</p>
<p>Hu Shaoqing, 32 years old, a refugee from Anhui at the Shanghai West Daxilu International Second Refugee Camp, was pulling a large flat cart to deliver goods to the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Avenue Saipo Sai at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. A bicycle was speeding toward him from the left. Hu turned the cart to avoid it but used too much force. Hu was knocked onto the sidewalk, and the cart wheels ran over his chest and back, crushing his right fingers. He was bleeding profusely. A patrol officer arrived and sent him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Young Woman Fell and Severely Injured</p>
<p>Wu Ruibao, a 17-year-old local girl residing at 10 Seymour Road, fell from the third-floor balcony at 8:00 AM yesterday, suffering severe injuries. Her family immediately rushed her to the hospital for treatment. It was reported that her injuries were critical and her life was in danger. It was later learned that the girl had previously studied at a certain girl's school. As the summer vacation was approaching, a major exam was held, and her performance in several subjects was slightly inferior, causing her to be depressed for nearly ten days.

<h3>Thugs Lurk in the Shadows, Stab a Couple</h3>
<p>Around 11:35 PM last night, in an alley next to the Central Savings Society at No. 1 Tianjin Road, a couple was stabbed in the abdomen and waist by an enemy using a knife. Afterwards, they were both sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The victims are identified as Peng Hanzhang, a Cantonese man, 49 years old, and his wife, Ms. Li, 43 years old. Both reside in the French Concession. Before the war, they operated a shop in Hongkou and employed an accountant named Wang. During his employment, Wang engaged in fraudulent activities, leading to his dismissal by Peng Hanzhang, which created a grudge. Last night, Wang learned that Peng and his wife were playing mahjong at a friend's house on Tianjin Road. He waited silently, hiding a sharp knife, and ambushed the Peng Hanzhang couple in the dark alley. He stabbed Peng twice in the abdomen and Ms. Li once in the right waist. The assailant fled without a trace. The injured were carried by the police to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhang Shutong's Calligraphy and Painting Examples</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Shutong's calligraphy, in the style of the Northern Wei Dynasty cursive script, has long been famous. Connoisseurs recognize that there are few who can compare to him among contemporary calligraphers.

Recently, requests for paintings have been coming one after another, and he cannot cope with them. He has no choice but to set a price list to limit them. The price list can be obtained at the inquiry office of the Shen Bao Newspaper, the Gu Xiang Studio on Wuma Road, and the Duoyunxuan on the Pouqiu Market.</p>

People from all walks of life are following each other to seek them. They have already received more than fifty or sixty pieces. It is said that the two gentlemen are too busy and will limit it to 200 pieces. Each page is priced at six gold coins. If only Bai Jiao's calligraphy or Fen Weng's rubbings are requested, the price is halved. The receiving address is Room 412, Zhonghui Building, 402 Avenue Edward VII, and the Social Daily Newspaper at 160 Avenue Edward VII, as well as Mr. Zhu Youde, Guanghua Affiliated Middle School, Securities Building, Sanma Road, and No. 82 Mouyi Lane, Shanhai Pass Road.</p>

<h3>How to Spend the Summer Vacation?</h3>
<p>— Fenfei</p>
<p>Hurry Up and Decide on a Summer Work Plan</p>
<p>The summer vacation is coming soon! What are we going to do during these two months? How can we ensure that time is not wasted? Well, I think perhaps you all have already made a work plan! Generally, in this summer vacation, there must be many children who have graduated, been promoted, or are employed, each preparing themselves for "the work they should do." However, among these many children, there may also be a small portion who are playful - playing games all day long. This is naturally a characteristic of children's nature. I am afraid that you have committed the above, so I am taking this opportunity to propose to you "How to Spend the Summer Vacation?"</p>
<p>First, "Enrich Your Knowledge": You have worked hard for a year. May I ask, what knowledge have you gained? Although it has been proven on the report card, are you enriched? In other words, are these grades your own abilities? Graduating friends are certainly happy, but during the summer vacation, you should still work hard. Not only should you not forget the knowledge you have gained before, but you should also have sufficient knowledge to apply for middle school. If you neglect it and waste your time, your studies will be like "a boat sailing against the current," "if you don't advance, you will retreat." Although summer is hot, it will be cool in the morning and evening. You can use this time to slowly study the knowledge you have learned in the past, which is "reviewing the old to know the new." Those general children who have not graduated or been promoted must work even harder, otherwise, you will "repeat a grade" next year. Now I hope you don't be shy or timid, as long as you are willing to put your heart into it, there is still hope. Second, "Cultivate Morality": In school, perhaps because of the strictness of teachers, you dare not violate school rules. Once you leave the school gate, you are as free as a wild horse, and you may encounter "naughty children" in the family all day long. As the ancients said, "Those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black" can indeed lure you onto a "wrong path." This is very dangerous! Therefore, even though we have left school, we still abide by school rules and must not be "naughty" by nature. Parents should pay attention to the behavior of their children. It must be strict, and indulgence becomes "doting." The biggest bad result. Generally, employed children must never let go of their own behavior. Remember the teaching that "a false step becomes a regret forever." Third, "Protect Your Body": In school, there are often cleanliness inspections, so you must pay attention to hygiene. If you leave school, you may neglect it. In Shanghai, where there are pigeonhole houses, and especially in the summer, summer hygiene should be especially noted, otherwise diseases can easily occur. When a person gets sick, he is naturally distressed, or if he encounters an infectious disease, it can affect the whole family, even endangering life.</p>
<p>Dear children! You must have already drawn up a work plan. The above is just a general situation. There are many details that you have to decide for yourself! At the same time, I hope that you will not slacken or neglect the three aspects of "intellect, morality, and body" during the two months of summer vacation, so as not to fail the teachings of the teachers.</p>
<p>(Note) Reviewing homework can be done according to the usual "schedule" by repeating the review.</p>
<h3>Why Conflicts Occur</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Among children, they often become unhappy over a small matter. Even good friends are unwilling to give in to each other, even scolding and fighting. Sometimes, parents cause adults to turn against each other because they love their children, but soon the children reconcile as before. This kind of recurring thing happens several times a day. This is another shortcoming of children and should be corrected quickly. I will now briefly explain a few reasons for conflicts among children below. Think carefully, are these words correct?</p>
<p>One. For the sake of small personal interests… What is meant by small personal interests is only caring about one's own selfish interests, regardless of the interests of the public. This can be said to be the main reason. You often have different opinions from others, so everyone disperses unhappily. For example, many companions get along and prepare to do a game, but each person is unwilling to accommodate the other's meaning, so it cannot be played; and everyone does not think that they are stubborn, but only blames others; and when there is a conflict of interest, they will turn against each other. This is all because they are too selfish.</p>
<p>Two. The harm of gossiping… Some children like to add embellishments to what others say and tell it to their good friends, thinking that they have fulfilled their responsibilities to their friends, but they do not know that they have increased conflicts and resentment among classmates.</p>
<p>Three. Lack of forgiveness… Others may unintentionally hurt you, but you rebuke him even more severely. For example, a classmate carelessly stepped on your foot. He has apologized, but you scold him and hit him until he cries before you consider yourself victorious. This kind of child is most easily looked down upon.</p>
<p>I think children must know that people cannot live apart from groups, and the opportunities for contact among them are even greater. If you always plan only for yourself, then the more opportunities for conflict, and after a long time, they will not like to be with you. At that time, you are all alone, how lonely, what fun is there. On the contrary, if you are willing to sacrifice yourself, do your best to help others, and are kind and friendly, then you will definitely have many friends. Not only will you get spiritual pleasure, but your studies will also improve day by day. Children, which kind of person do you envy? As long as you always pay attention to reducing the causes of conflict, then your future group will also be harmonious, happy, and mutually supportive.</p>
<h3>Gifts for Children</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Gifts for Children Lai - This City's Animal Protection Association Donates 3,000 Copies of the Animal Special Issue of the Fuyou Newspaper</p>
<p>Dear children! Do you know there is an "Animal Protection Association" in Shanghai! Its purpose is to have us all love domestic animals; do not let them suffer from hunger and cold, and do not allow them to be abused, because we know that dogs, cats, pigeons, etc., not only serve us, but are also our good companions. When necessary, they are also willing to sacrifice their lives for us! I remember a foreign friend told me a true story: One winter, he and his friend were traveling in a sleigh pulled by five dog brothers when they encountered a wolf halfway. Although they tried their best to drive the sleigh to escape, they were ultimately no match for the wolf. Just as the wolf was about to approach them, two dogs suddenly jumped out and fought the wolf, while the remaining three continued to pull the sleigh forward. As a result, the two righteous dogs resolutely sacrificed themselves for their master. Also, during the Franco-Prussian War, a French military pigeon rescued hundreds of French soldiers in a desperate situation. There are really many stories like this!</p>
<p>During the Songhu Battle two years ago, a Hungarian child suddenly followed his parents and fled from Yangshupu. Later, he discovered that three good friends were still in his home. The three good friends were a dog, a rooster, and a parrot that he loved. Because he could not bear to let them starve to death there, he went from Pudong across the river to Yangshupu regardless of everything. Naturally, he encountered many unexpected dangers along the way, but he finally brought his three good friends out of the war zone. Later, the Shanghai "Animal Protection Association" (No. 18 Ma Huo Road) learned about this and reported it to the American headquarters and the British branch, and they awarded him a gold medal and a silver badge to reward this little hero.</p>
<p>Because the Shanghai "Animal Protection Association" wants to promote the protection of domestic animals, it specifically borrowed the "Guangxue Society's Fuyou Newspaper to publish an animal special issue, preparing to distribute it to you children. The content includes "A Petition," "The Emperor's Nightingale," "Loyal Little Yellow," "Magic"... etc. After you see this good news, please quickly tell your classmates, and please ask your principal to write to the "Fuyou Newspaper at No. 128 Museum Road, Shanghai Guangxue Society" to request it.</p>
<h3>Two Little Swans in the Flames of War</h3>

<h3>Graduation Ceremony (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Lao Du</p>
<p>On this day, our school held a grand graduation ceremony, with tens of thousands of people crowding in front of the chapel. I spent a lot of effort and was finally squeezed in by them. I wanted to find a seat in the center, but in fact, it had already been taken by the audience. I squeezed forward even more, looking around for an empty seat. In the very front two or three rows, I finally found one with great difficulty.</p>
<p>Here, a girl left some empty seats for me and looked at me with her wide brown eyes. Her face was as beautiful as a rose in the morning light. Gradually, I also realized that my gaze was fixed on her face, but every time it met her lively and smiling eyes. This girl seemed to want to be friends with me. She returned my handkerchief that had fallen to the ground with a clever smile, and I thanked her gratefully. This sound was considered the most appropriate introduction by both parties. At this time, another person squeezed down and sat next to me, which made me even closer to her, so we immediately became very familiar.</p>
<p>"It's very crowded here"! She said to me.</p>
<p>"That's right," I replied, "Everyone likes to see the last stage of students entering society." Her face smiled, and her father said very proudly: "My brother is graduating today, and he will also go on stage to give a speech, so I came with this bouquet of flowers, ready to throw it up when he finishes his speech." This flower is not a treasure from the flower shop, but a very common offering flower in the family, just like we are holding our grandmother. "But," I thought, "This flower is ordinary, but her brother must like it, because it was sent by his sister."</p>
<p>"That's my brother." She said, gazing at the bouquet.</p>
<p>"Is it the one with the light-colored hair"? I asked.</p>
<p>"No," she shook her head with a smile, seemingly unintentionally blaming me. "Not the one who looks ordinary. He has very beautiful coffee-colored and wavy hair, and his eyes look brown, but they are actually dark brown. Over there, his hand is raised high, have you seen him"?</p>
<p>She looked at him very eagerly from me, and looked at me from him, as if trying her best to make me see that he was her brother.</p>
<p>"I see him," I said. "He is a very handsome brother."</p>
<p>"Yes, he is very beautiful," she said very happily and frankly: "He is so good and so hardworking! After my mother died, he cared for me. Although he is not a representative to give farewell words, he has won honors in his class."</p>
<p>I thought she was very close to this school and was particularly concerned about her brother's studies, hopes, and success.</p>
<h3>Children's Road Safety Campaign</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Children! The Public Concession and the French Concession will hold a Road Safety Campaign Week starting from June 18th. Indeed, in this city of Shanghai, after the number of cars has increased, the number of accidents has also increased year by year. After the population of the concession increased sharply, the number of victims of car accidents also set a new record. Because the number of children killed and injured in accidents is not small, children should also pay considerable attention to the issue of road safety campaigns.</p>
<p>Regarding the road safety of children, we of course hope that general elementary school teachers will take the opportunity to instill some common sense about road safety in class, so that general children know to be careful when walking, and they can be familiar with various traffic rules. But on the other hand, children should also pay attention to road safety at all times, so that they will not encounter danger when walking.</p>
<p>Children under the age of ten must not walk on the road alone, and should be accompanied by parents or adults when going out. Regarding this point, parents should of course pay special attention. After school, students chasing each other on the road can easily cause accidents. As for roller skating and learning to ride a bicycle on the road, it is even more dangerous. These bad habits should absolutely not be contaminated.</p>
<p>Every child should know the road traffic rules. Walk on the left, walk on the sidewalks on both sides. The middle is the passage for vehicles; be extra careful when crossing the road: where there are traffic lights, you can only pass when the green light is on, and the red light cannot be walked; there is also a kind of automatic traffic light with three colors of lights, in addition to the red and green lights, there is also a yellow light, which indicates that the color of the light is about to change. Once you see the yellow light. You can't cross over either; where there are no traffic lights, the policeman raises his hand to block you, which is an indication that you can't cross over; some cars are equipped with automatic pointers when turning, and some are gestured by the driver, no matter whether it is a pointer or a gesture, which side it points to, it means that the car is going to turn to that side; these are things everyone should know.</p>
<p>Children are most likely to listen to instructions, and will do as they are told once they know them. But for all kinds of common sense about road safety, children should not only know it themselves, but also be responsible for promoting and relaying it to others. If people at home do not understand or relatives and friends from the inland do not know the traffic rules of Shanghai at all, then children can tell them. In this way, not only can you walk safely, but even others can walk safely because of your relay. Well, during this Road Safety Campaign Week, we sincerely hope that all children in Shanghai can pay extra attention to walking safety and engage in publicity.</p>
<h3>One Stroke Drawing</h3>

<h3>The Natural World in Summer</h3>
<p>— Li Yuyong</p>
<p>In summer, the mercury in the thermometer stretches lazily, unless it is very cool, it is too lazy to move at all.</p>
<p>When you get up in the morning, if you take a walk on the grass, your shoes will get wet with the dew on the grass. Those butterflies whose wings have been wetted by the dew do not fly out until eight or nine o'clock. At this time, the annoying flies also come out. In the evening, you can only hear the mosquitoes buzzing: under the light of the electric light, you can also see many small moths, floaters, etc. flying around; so many people hang garlic to prevent them from flying close. But when the electric light is turned off, bed bugs come out to bite people.</p>
<p>If it is even hotter, you can also hear the cicadas chirping, coming from the thick shade of those French parasol trees along the street. There are many dragonflies flying by the pool. Sometimes they fly close to the surface of the water and lay many eggs in a string. In the countryside, as soon as the evening arrives, the sound of the mole crickets in the fields is mistaken for earthworms. Bats are catching mosquitoes and moths in the dark, and fireflies are lighting up and flying in the grass.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the climate changes, we can see even more small animals. The spider will no longer make a delicate web when it is about to rain, and swarms of dragonflies and a few solitary horseheads will fly out at this time. When the heavy rain is over, snails crawl on the walls, and earthworms escape from the full water holes and die of illness.</p>
<p>In the suburbs, this is the season when wildflowers are in full bloom. If we pay a little attention, we can know that their flowers bloom at what time in the morning and at what time in the evening, and they all have a certain time. So some people arrange them into a "flower clock" according to the time of flowering. It's just that we haven't seen wildflowers for a long time on the isolated island, so let's wait for victory to make the fun "flower clock".</p>
<h3>Among the Beasts (6)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>After being injured, Knox felt resentful and mumbled to himself for a full half hour, not knowing who had hurt him. Before long, however, he gradually fell asleep and dreamed of his enemy, barking at him incessantly.</p>
<p>Peng Qi, having stabbed Knox, slipped away to play with Le Fu. He picked up a cane and threw it at him. Le Fu dared not be negligent and hurriedly caught it with his teeth. Peng Qi walked over, grabbed one end of the cane, and spun it around vigorously. Le Fu's body followed the spinning cane, something he was used to. However, this time his teeth seemed to have weakened, and by the fifth spin, he lost his grip on the cane, something that had never happened before.</p>
<p>Le Fu, seeing the fierce glint in Peng Qi's eyes, knew he was in for a beating. With a bark and a spin, he fled for his life. Peng Qi chased him for a while but couldn't catch him. Instead, he ran into Xiao Tang, who was chasing a Scottish foxhound, throwing stones at it. Peng Qi thought this was a great game and immediately joined the chase. A large stone he threw struck the dog's head squarely, instantly ending its life.</p>
<p>That night, a neighbor lost a fine foxhound, and the river gained a dog's corpse.</p>
<p>When Peng Qi went to bed, he tossed and turned for a long time, unable to fall asleep. He regretted throwing the dog into the river, fearing it would cause more trouble. He remembered getting a beating for Mr. Gutman's poodle and nearly getting one for Mrs. de Beer's cat, only to have Le Fu wrongly blamed, even though he was the culprit. He knew that although Knox had been stabbed today, it wasn't a big deal. Tomorrow morning, as soon as the sun rose, he was sure to resume his charitable work by the river. Once he picked up the foxhound's corpse, there would undoubtedly be more trouble for him to bear. Peng Qi, knowing himself, would never get up early in the morning. It would be better to sneak down to the river under the cover of darkness, use a hayfork to lift the dog's corpse, and hide or bury it. Then there would be no problem.</p>

<h3>From the High Cost of Everything to A Laboring Family</h3>
<p>— Fu Yun</p>
<p>Everyone relies on the cooperative effort of their own hands to build a happy family</p>
<p>In this time of soaring prices and expensive clothing, food, housing, and daily necessities, the residents of the isolated island, especially those who escaped the "August 13th" artillery fire, are living a precarious existence. Faced with such unsustainable conditions, everyone cries out, "Life is hard!" As a result, many who have already rented houses are seeking refuge in refugee self-sufficiency centers due to rising rents and expensive daily necessities (even the thatched huts in the western suburbs of Shanghai, where the annual land rent used to be one yuan, now rent for three to five yuan a month). (The self-sufficiency centers require individuals to buy their own meals. Currently, the Relief Association at the Second Shelter on Yanping Road sells white rice at three cents per pound, or refugees can buy their own rice and cook it themselves.) At the same time, refugees who have found suitable work within the shelters, earning enough to support a family of three or four, cannot leave refugee life immediately because they cannot afford the rent.</p>
<p>Someone once said, "In a famine, the lazy starve to death." This is certainly true. Not just today, when affected by war, but even in peaceful times, if a person is lazy and seeks only comfort, procrastinating and sitting idle, even if they have some savings, they will eventually eat it all away. In the past, those who lived in war zones suffered the devastation of artillery fire, with families broken and lives lost. Relatives and friends who lived in the same war zones also scattered and lost their livelihoods. If they don't find their own way out, who can they rely on? The author is also a refugee who used to live in a war zone. In the past two years, I have seen many refugees who escaped from war zones with nothing to their name, first entering shelters, where entire families lived as refugees. Later, they found their own means of survival and work, and now they have all escaped refugee life. Among these people, I would like to highlight the family of my friend, Mr. Yu. All six members of his family work and contribute. Through their united cooperation and individual efforts in their respective production work, they still maintain the joy of a happy family reunion in this environment of high living costs. This is truly commendable! Mr. Yu's father passed away several years ago. He was a scholar, and based on his own experiences, he felt that the life of a scholar who relies on writing was unreliable. Therefore, he decided that his sons should become workers, relying on their skills and labor to earn a living. So, Mr. Yu's brothers all became workers. Mr. Yu was originally an electrician and ran an electrical supply store in Nanshi before the war, working as a boss. During the "August 13th" battle, all six members of his family (his elderly mother, wife, sister, brother, sister-in-law, and himself) entered a shelter. The brother, sister, wife, and sister-in-law all took on service work within the shelter. Last year, they left refugee life and found a house for twelve yuan a month. His family's expenses are covered by a system of collective support and shared responsibilities. His brother, who is a coppersmith, earns twenty yuan a month and is responsible for the twelve yuan monthly rent. His wife and sister work in a cloth factory, each earning between one and twenty yuan a month, and each contributes six yuan to the household for food (Mr. Yu's brother, sister-in-law, and himself do not eat at home). His sister-in-law lives at the factory and comes home once a week, bringing back cooked dishes, and contributes four yuan to the household each month. Mr. Yu himself works in an electrical supply store, earning over twenty yuan a month, and is responsible for daily groceries. Cooking, laundry, and all household chores are done cooperatively. His elderly mother, in addition to managing household affairs, also helps with sewing from time to time. Their family's clothes do not require paying a tailor. Recently, Mr. Yu also took on a job at a machine factory, co-founded by his friend. This kind of family, everyone relies on their own labor to make a living, sharing all expenses, has become a very happy family. From this, it can be further proved that "unity" and "effort" will give us a satisfactory answer.</p>

<h3>"A Humble Old Man on the Vast Earth"</h3>
<p>— Yu Tieqi</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw a news item in the newspaper that Mr. Fen Weng was going to hold a solo exhibition of calligraphy and seal carving. I was so impressed by the achievements of this eccentric figure in the art world that I tried to find out his address and boldly paid him a visit.</p>
<p>I had heard some strange stories about Mr. Fen Weng's unique personality, so when I arrived at his door, my footsteps faltered. But after an hour of conversation, the rumors proved to be untrue. Mr. Fen Weng was not the kind of person I had imagined, who flaunted his own style with bizarre behavior. On the contrary, from his sincerity, candor, and lack of self-satisfaction, one could see that he was brimming with the demeanor of an artist with decades of rigorous practice.</p>
<p>When I was led into the room where Mr. Fen Weng creates his art, he had just finished writing a handscroll in the cursive style of Huai Su. The handscroll was more than forty feet long, a rare masterpiece. The brushstrokes were full of vigor and flowing freely (that handscroll was also one of the exhibits in the upcoming Fen Weng solo exhibition).</p>
<p>Mr. Fen Weng was resting after writing. He had a cigarette in his hand, a few strands of white hair drifted from his forehead, and his body reclined on the sofa, seemingly lost in thought. He invited me to sit down and answered a series of questions I had prepared in advance. It is said that since he participated in the Cup Water Exhibition last summer, many people who loved his calligraphy and seal carving had urged him to hold a solo exhibition. But because he was preparing to open the Ce Jian Lou Jin Shi Painting and Calligraphy Lecture, he was busy writing lecture notes, and only had free time this spring. So he actively engaged in the preparations for the current solo exhibition. It is now decided that from June 28th to July 2nd, the painting and seal carving solo exhibition will be held for five consecutive days on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Yuchaqing Road. Admission is free, and all are welcome to visit. A total of more than two hundred pieces are on display, as well as more than a hundred fan surfaces. During the solo exhibition, there will be special carving rates: stone seals are eight yuan per seal, and ivory seals are twelve yuan per seal, which is much cheaper than the original price.</p>
<p>Speaking of seals, Mr. Fen Weng has been immersed in this art for almost thirty years. He initially had no teacher, but he extensively studied the works of the Zhejiang School. Because of the rigor of the seal script, his works do not veer into wildness despite their grandeur. Later, he became a student of Zhao Guni of Yushan and fully inherited his mantle. That old Mr. Zhao was the leading seal carver of his generation after the death of Changshuo Wu. After Mr. Zhao also passed away, Mr. Fen Weng accepted his tradition. In recent years, Mr. Fen Weng has devoted himself to imitating the official and private seals of the Han Dynasty, so his works have become more and more imbued with a simple and vigorous spirit. It is said that a scroll of Han Dynasty royal seals that he has personally copied will also be displayed in the current solo exhibition.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Fen Weng's superb artistry, I will only copy a poem sent to him by the party and state elder, Bai Wenwei, as the conclusion to this article. It reads: "The spirit of the Han and Wei dynasties, the atmosphere of the Tang and Song dynasties, poetry, calligraphy, gold, and stone are all outstanding achievements. The ancients did not see the cold mountains and rivers, the vast earth is a humble old man."</p>

<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Encourage Learning, Promote Agriculture, and Store Resources for the Nation; Retain the Strong and Eliminate the Weak, Select Seeds with Fields</p>
<p>It is said that everyone who was a friend of Zhao Letian knew about the love story between Zhao Letian and Pan Peiying. Village Chief Zhu had worked with Zhao Letian before and was considered an old friend, so he naturally knew everything. By the time Zhao Letian and Pan Peiying got married, the Sino-Japanese War had been settled. Zhao Letian's father liked excitement and understood that Pan Peiying sincerely loved his son, and after receiving news of his death in battle, she remained chaste and did not marry. Now that the two were finally united in marriage, he held a grand feast. Many friends spread the word, considering it a beautiful story, and Zhu Aiqun probably heard it from her grand-uncle, Village Chief Zhu. However, Aiqun probably didn't know the details, so the author has recounted the events of Zhao and Pan in detail. At the time, Village Chief Zhu smiled and said, "Our Village Chief Xu is still strong and vigorous in his old age, a withered poplar growing ladders, which is a rare thing in the world. Even he himself probably thinks it's unexpected, right? As for Zhao Letian, that's another matter. He's still in his prime. Although there's a love story involved, he still sows the cause first and reaps the result later. Because there are some ups and downs in the story, it's very much like a romantic novel, so people call it a love story. But it's not as if people admire his one leg, and specifically want to choose a man with one leg as their son-in-law. However, I feel very comfortable now, too. People should take a step back and be content with everything. As the ancients said, 'Contentment brings happiness,' and I really admire this saying. You see, since ancient times, many earth-shattering events have been caused by not being content. Why are there aggressors? It's because of a lack of contentment in their hearts, which has invaded them. At that time, they are ambitious, feeling that occupying a little of someone else's territory is good. Naturally, others are not willing to give in, so disputes and killings arise. Therefore, whether it's a large country or a small individual, it's all the same. In the past, because others came to invade and bully us, we naturally had to resist. Fortunately, in the end, our sacrifice was not in vain. We protected our land and safeguarded our sovereignty, without losing a single bit. We don't want to invade others, but we won't let others invade us either. If someone wants to attack me, I will honestly and without hesitation strike back, which is called 'striking the attacker with a strike.' At this moment, we still live and work in peace, restoring our freedom, and being ordinary people. My age is almost up, and I didn't die at that time, but only lost an arm, which is considered a blessing. The years that follow are my remaining life. So when I think about it, Zhao Letian's name is Letian, and if I were to change my name, I should be called Yusheng [Remaining Life]!" (145)</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Shutong's Running Script</h3>
<h3>Why Must One Believe in Jesus? (1) Because All People Have Sinned</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The scripture says, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." It also says, "And are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus." In these two passages, we are clearly told why people need to believe in Jesus, and we are made to recognize that God is absolutely just. He neither deceives the poor nor favors the rich; he has confined all the people in the world to sin, and you and I are included. Whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, male or female, old or young, rich or poor, everyone has committed the sin of falling short of the glory of God; because the universe and all things were created by God, and the lives, actions, and existence of us human beings are also in His hands. Gentlemen! God has given you the breath of life... and given you the joy of enjoying nature. May I ask: Do you have gratitude in your heart? Do you praise Him with your mouth? If not! That is committing sin, falling short of the glory of God, just like a daughter's unfilial and disobedient treatment of her parents, a sin that is so deep. According to God's law, the retribution for sin is death. But God forbears the destruction of the world and establishes a way of salvation for sin. As it says in the scripture above: "And are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus." Therefore, the sins we have committed in our lives are forgiven through the redemption of Jesus Christ on the cross, and we are transferred from the status of sinners to the status of the righteous, and we are reconciled to God, like a father and son reuniting and living a life of mutual understanding.

<h3>Watching Mao Shilai and Others Perform "Nanjie Pass"</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Mao Shilai's second engagement at the Golden Theatre shows great improvement compared to before. I watched his "Xin An Zhou" some time ago, and although it was beautiful, it was not perfect. I wrote an article hoping that he would work hard on the "fierce" aspect of his performance. On June 20th, I watched his "Nanjie Pass" again. This play is the pinnacle of his performances. Why? Shilai's only concern is his inability to be fierce. Now, in this play, he can be "fierce." Moreover, it is a grand play, so what else could it be but a masterpiece? First, let me describe the story of "Nanjie Pass," and then I will give a detailed commentary.</p>
<p>The Later Zhou Dynasty ordered Zhao Kuangyin to invade the Southern Tang Dynasty. Liu Renzhan, the chief general of Shouzhou, and his wife, Xu Jinhua, firmly defended the city without surrendering. Liu was injured by a sword and recuperating, so his concubine, Hua Yingchun, took the opportunity to have an affair with the adjutant, He Yanxi, and stole the command to surrender the city to the enemy. The city fell, Liu was captured, and Xu, carrying her young son, fought her way into the enemy camp. There, she met her husband and personally killed the adulterer and adulteress.</p>
<p>Shilai plays Xu Jinhua. Her opening fight and patrolling of the city are exceptionally impressive, with amazing stilt skills (leaping, running, shuffling steps, setbacks, walking in circles, all kinds of tricks, one after another), fast and fierce. Her postures and poses are also worth seeing. The city patrolling scene involves singing Kunqu Opera while dancing, which is very demanding. However, her low voice is not yet developed and still needs hard work. The Xipi Yuanban in the appreciating chrysanthemums scene proves that she has mastered popular tunes, so there is hope for her singing in the future.</p>
<p>The scenes of this play are quite tight, and the critical moments are wonderful. The words of the script are also worth appreciating. It seems to be adapted from a Kunqu Opera romance, with loyalty and value. Shilai and others perform with great effort, which can make money and make them popular. Along with "Jiangyou Pass" and "Xun Guan Niang," it is a good historical play that should be promoted more. In the peeping scene, when speaking to the concubine, she suddenly adds a lot of Pekingese dialect. This is an innovation, probably because it is a very good play, and she is afraid that the audience cannot fully understand the rhyming language, so she suddenly changed to Pekingese dialect?</p>
<p>In this play, Shilai has one part that seems inappropriate. When returning to the mansion after patrolling the city, Madam Xu sees enemy soldiers capturing her husband and draws her sword as if to fight, saying, "Watch my sword!" But the enemy soldiers ignore her and leave. The Madam has no choice but to put her sword back in its sheath. This section has no outcome and should be changed. In my opinion, it should be changed to the enemy soldiers leaving, and the Madam drawing her sword and shouting, "I should chase and save my husband, but I am outnumbered, and I must protect my young son. I will return to the mansion to save my son and then make a plan." I wonder if that would be good?</p>
<p>On this day, Shilai performed with particular effort. There were one or two places where she used too much force and almost made a mistake. Some people will surely advise her not to be too fierce in the future, in order to be safe. I don't agree. This is a manifestation of vigor. Let young people have some fire, even if there are some slips, it doesn't matter. With more experience, they will naturally become stable. If you always want to be safe, then you are close to lukewarm, and lukewarm makes it difficult to progress. (The above is about Mao Shilai)</p>
<p>Gao Shenglin plays Gao Huailiang. His entrance and martial skills are all good. Guan Shengxi plays Zhao Kuangyin. His singing and dialogue are solid, but his low voice is a little weak. Sha Shixin plays Liu Renzhan adequately. In two or three years, when his voice comes out, he will surely become popular. Ai Shiju plays Liu Yanxi. He has the scope of the old "square scarf" role, and is good at jump-opening. His low voice, which is not clear and loud, is a defect.</p>
<p>Finally, I should talk about the Kun corner of Yu Sulian, who plays Liu's concubine. Her art of flirting is extraordinary. Yu Sulian is a natural material for a flower girl. Her face, features, and skin are all excellent. She is willing to do amorous things and is able to do them well. Although her voice is not loud, it is extremely clear and round. In this play, she plays Hua Yingchun, secretly meeting Yanxi in his bedroom. After seeing him, she feigns a change of heart, gradually offering wine to the lover, and gradually leading him offstage. When Madam Xu calls at the door, her appearance is wonderfully charming, truly willing to do it and able to do it. It was obvious to everyone that day, and I cannot describe it in detail, lest I commit the sin of lewd words.</p>
<p>In short, this play has two scenes of flirting interspersed, so everyone likes to watch it, and Yu Sulian is able to do it well, so the whole play is lively.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Drama Performance to Raise Funds by the Dancers' Mutual Aid Society</h3>
<p>— Zhihua</p>
<p>The sisters of the dance industry performed a one-act play called "Dancer's Tears" last year, which I saw. It was a collective creation, and although it lacked writing experience, the truth of life made the writing techniques seem important. This is a groan of the weak, but this groan is magnificent, and this is the beginning of self-awareness.</p>
<p>This year they will perform again. The plays are two: "Dancer's Tears" and "A Dancer in Shanghai." Both are one-act plays, probably due to time and other limitations. "A Dancer in Shanghai" was written several years before "Dancer's Tears." It describes the unfortunate encounters of a dancer in a "corner of the metropolis." The play is a sketch, but here it explains to us one of the social reasons for the creation of dancers. From the performances I have seen several times, they all have good stage effects.</p>
<p>"A Dancer in Shanghai" illustrates that a girl who has lost her hometown in Mongolia can only earn a living in this society through her sexuality, and her lover is sent to the police station for failing to withstand the exploitation of high-interest loans. "Dancer's Tears," while still a groan of the weak, is already the cry of the dancers after self-awareness. As for "Tears of Flowers," it is there that we see Dingxiang. They have self-esteem from self-awareness: "We are dancers, free professional women; we are dancers, citizens of the Republic of China." And they clearly see this scene, the sky full of wind and clouds!</p>
<p>The purpose of this performance is to raise funds, which means that they have realized the importance of group power. "One bamboo pole is easy to break, three cotton threads are hard to pull apart." Especially the weak who are insulted and harmed, they must have a group to back them up. At the same time, they are already members of this group, and only then will they have security. And the most important purpose, they want to be a "person," a dignified person!</p>
<p>No one can stop the giant wheels of the times. If you don't follow it, you can only be crushed under its wheels. And next year, in addition to "A Dancer in Shanghai," "Dancer's Tears," and "Tears of Flowers," there will definitely be new plays about the lives of dancers. Inside, there will be more Dingxiangs, and even Mimi and Gu Xiaomei will become more active. They will be as strong as steel in a ring. (Charity Sale for Funds)</p>

<h3>Hou Yulan's Theatrical Life</h3>
<p>— Bosheng</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai for Sightseeing and Experience, Her Theatrical Skills are Improving Day by Day, and Her Hopes are Endless.</p>
<p>Following Mao Shilai, the Golden Theatre has hired the Tan-style old male role actor, Yan Jupeng, to come south. Hou Yulan also came with him, as reported in this newspaper earlier. Recently, Yulan has performed with the famous old male role actor, Xi Xiaobo, in Beijing. It was still the first decision. On the first day of performing in Huale Garden, the sold-out sign was hung up at eight o'clock, which shows her appeal. Yulan is a senior student of the Peking Opera School. In every school-wide examination, she ranked first. Not only are her theatrical skills outstanding, but her literary foundation is also excellent. She just graduated last winter during the Bathing Buddha Festival at the young age of twenty-one. Her father, Yueting, is an amateur who specializes in the old male role. He is over forty years old and often engages in the life of Pear Garden in Tianjin. Her mother is still alive and only gave birth to Yulan, whom they love dearly. She loved drama since she was a child and once studied with a female actress. At the age of eleven, she played Cai Lou Pei in a private performance. Because of her intelligence and talent, she was encouraged by relatives and friends to study at the opera school. She went on stage in just a few months. The first time she sang "Entering the Palace Twice," and her co-stars were Zhao Deyu and Wang Helin. She was an instant hit and was valued by the school. Yulan is quiet by nature, does not like to dress up, and is devoted to learning art, so her progress is very fast. Since Zhao Jinrong left the school, Yulan has been promoted to be the best. After graduation, some people urged her to form a troupe, but she felt that her academic strength was insufficient, so she stayed at school to observe. The school hired her as an assistant teacher, giving her only fifteen yuan a month, and her daily income from performances was not very high. Yulan said that she was content to be able to provide for her mother, and her filial piety is admirable. Two months ago, her father Fang Nuo brought more than a thousand yuan to make dozens of fashionable clothes for her, waiting for an opportunity to try them out. Other places offered high prices to hire her, but she was unmoved. This time, she came to Shanghai with Jupeng. At first, there were changes. After someone explained to her parents that she was coming to Shanghai for sightseeing and to gain experience, Yulan decided to come with Yan. Here, there is a lack of leading female actors. Yulan can improve her skills day by day, and her future prospects are endless.</p>
<h3>Dance Hall Women's Association Performing a Play</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dance Hall Women's Association, in order to raise funds, is scheduled to perform a public performance tomorrow morning (the 25th) at 10:00 AM at the Carlton Grand Theatre. ("Tears of a Dancing Girl," directed by Gong Jianong, starring Shu Shi, Ni Wenxian, Wang Qinzhen, Yin Meifeng, Wei Chuyun, and Jin Didi. "Shanghai Dancing Girl" is directed by Zeshan Wucun, starring Bai Yun, Xu Li, Yang Wenying, Fang Xiang, Wu Ying, and Xiao Juan. The joint performance by the film, drama, and dance industries should be regarded as a groundbreaking effort. Using the life experience of dance hall women to perform a play with the theme of dance hall women, its authenticity and touching nature can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Skating Technique (62)</h3>
<p>— Jointly Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen</p>
<p>Four-Sided (Continued)</p>
<p>2.  Second Practice Method: First, use the first body position with one foot completely to make an outward circle. After completing the circle, the guest foot should not land. The main foot continues to use the second body position to overlap the first circle, making a second circle. Each foot should make two circles, forming a double-movement pattern or an 8-shape.</p>
<p>Beginners find this method very difficult, but it will be achieved with practice, and the hard work will not be in vain. After learning the first and second body positions, the third and fourth positions must be learned immediately.</p>
<p>The third position is very useful for advanced skating, such as after an outward backward swing turn, before an outward forward bracket, after an inward backward three-turn, or before an outward forward three-turn.</p>
<p>In the third position, the guest shoulder and arm are in front, the head faces the center of the circle, and the guest leg remains behind. The body from the hips up is the opposite of the first position.</p>
<p>The fourth position, from the waist up, is the opposite of the second position. The guest arm and shoulder are behind, and the guest leg is in front. It must be used after an inward backward three-turn and after an outward backward swing turn.</p>
<p>If these four body positions can be fully understood and used well, then in future free skating competitions and at an advanced level, patterns can be created at will without feeling any difficulty.</p>
<p>2.  Inward progress using the inner edge of the shoe is slightly easier than using the outer edge because the whole body naturally leans inward. However, it is not easy to maintain with one foot, so you must first practice the foot arch so that it does not lean inward and can allow the moving foot to walk independently, and the more you can keep the guest leg behind, the better. For inward progress, the body position from the waist up is the opposite of the outward progress start, because the guest shoulder and guest arm are in front first. When the body starts to rotate, the guest shoulder gently moves back, and the guest leg moves to the front of the main leg and above the main leg (that is, on the arc). At the end of the circle, the main shoulder is in front, the guest arm crosses slightly in front of the body, and the main arm remains behind. At the end of the circle, the body leans slightly outward, and the guest leg must cross the main leg completely, making the guest foot reach outside the circle line to avoid forming a 6-shape.</p>
<p>The difficulty of inward progress lies in taking the first step. The common problem is taking too large a step, and the heel is not easy to turn outward. It is best to keep both feet close together, bend both knees deeply, only touch the edge, and apply force to the heel. There is no need to push hard. The above is based on the first and second body positions. When changing feet, the guest shoulder moves forward first, so that the whole body faces forward instead of sideways.</p>
<p>In the third position, from the waist up, it is the opposite of the first position. The main shoulder is in front, and the guest leg is behind. This position is used before an inward forward three-turn, after an inward backward swing turn, and after an outward backward three-turn.</p>
<p>In the fourth position, from the waist up, it is the opposite of the second position. The guest shoulder, guest arm, and guest leg are in front. The movement of the shoulder is in the rotation of the waist, and the guest foot is on the arc, as in the second position. This position is actually very important because this position must be used for all of the following patterns: the first arc of an inward forward three-turn, after an inward backward swing turn, and after an inward forward bracket. Therefore, the third and fourth positions must be practiced in the same way as the first and second positions.</p>

<h3>Construction of a Wharf on the Bund</h3>
<p>According to regulations, the Huangpu Bund Road in the French Concession ends at the Jinliyuan Wharf, and no wharves or warehouses are allowed to be built along the riverbank in order to allow pedestrians to see the river surface and prevent the view from being blocked by the warehouses. Now, Jardine Matheson is planning to build a wharf in the water opposite the road in front of the newly purchased Gongzheng old base warehouse to facilitate the berthing and unloading of its ships traveling to and from Hankou. Once the plan was finalized, it wrote to the French Engineering Department on the one hand and started piling work on the other. This is encroaching on the river boundary. The French believe that the land does not belong to him alone, and the water surface in front of the land can be used by him. However, if this principle is extended, the entire river will belong to the owners of the land along the riverbank.</p>
<h3>Additional Patrol Officer Appointed to the Eight Immortals Bridge</h3>
<p>The Eight Immortals Bridge in Xinzha is connected to the foreign concessions and far from the city walls. Due to the difficulty of surveillance, it has always been a place for harboring criminals. After Shen the Investigator dispatched Yuan Sima Shuxun to lead the patrolmen to be stationed at the Great King Temple in Xinzha for patrols at any time, the alternate official Yao Gong was now additionally commissioned to join the patrol.</p>
<h3>Land for Sale</h3>
