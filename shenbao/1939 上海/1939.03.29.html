<p>種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆；若滿淸之覆亡，共和之建立，決非偶然，決非倖致也。蓋閱二十餘年之革命運動，經志士仁人之悲壯犧牲，前仆後繼，百折不撓，義聲所樹，羣情嚮往；，故至辛亥十月而瓜熟蒂落。謂以淸政不綱，官貪兵惰，斯如摧枯拉朽，然當時義師亦豈勁旅，所謂民軍能有幾何；誠非革命意念普遍遐邇，深入人心，詎得一舉成功哉！是在雙十之前：歷年或以語言蒙難，或以文字興獄，或暗殺疆吏，或舉旗倡義；凡此革命性之作為，雖若無所成就，然轟轟烈烈，發聾振瞶，其效即在廣播革命種子，灌輸革命意念；辛亥發難於武昌，而響應者四起。固以此為直接因素者也。其問最著者，即為二十八年前三月二十九日廣州之役；與其役者僅百餘人，殉其役者七十二。猶憶去年今日，憑弔黃花崗前者，自朝至暮，數逾十萬；抑亦年年此日，是此景象；茲則粵垣未復，遙望白雲山麓，陰霾四蔽，然豐碑矗立，固猶宛然雲表也。</p>
<p>每讀革命史乘，領悟其人其事之所以為偉大，求諸現實主義機會主義功利主義所交織之現代，完全不可同日而語；輒景仰其人如超人，想像其事如別在一宇宙。蓋今世之尙現實，趨機會，務功利者，以小己目前之利害得失禍福難易為一切行動之標準；益於小已則行則為，無益於小已則望望然去之。於是而社會道德國際道德之水準銳降，世界浩刧瞬至，有由來也。若黃花崗七十二烈士，與為革命而死難之無數烈士，赴湯蹈火，義無返顧，夫何所為者？彼不計酬報而為之，埋名隱姓而為之；彼或明知失敗，或不以為竟有成功之一日，惟視為應為而毅然為之；彼或深信終能成功，深知成功之有造於衆人，顧乃視死如歸，不求及身享受而欣然為之；取義成仁，為國為族：夫豈現實主義機會主義功利主義之徒所得夢見哉。</p>
<p>英靈不爽。光復華夏，雖爾後一二十年，中國國運顚沛，必重違諸烈士爭取共和之素志；然最近二十一個月抗戰之成績，乃至抗戰建國後之燦爛前途，猶應歸功於諸烈士。試一假想之：侵略國家之處心積慮，希圖兼併中國而實現其大陸政策之野心者，歷數十年於茲，蓋遠在辛亥之前；若滿淸苟延殘喘而不亡於辛亥，則侵略國家之發動武力，必不待一九三一年之九一八，而先若干年有九一八之變矣；侵略所至滿淸必無能戰之君臣，國民亦豈為滿淸而作戰，更按之彼「寗送友邦，不予家奴」之意識，必納欵稱臣，以繼朝鮮之後矣；豈復有抗戰餘地如今日哉？是以摧毀滿淸者，諸烈士也；為國族造就復興之機會者，亦諸烈士也。不特如此而已，滿淸二百餘年，自宮廷以迄胥吏，卑汚苟賤，馴至朝野幾無些微正氣；爭於朝，爭於野者，莫非機會也，功利也。幸而革命烈士，充分發揮獻身國族之精神，並以行動昭示犧牲小己之模楷；使國族五千年來智仁勇之文化，不絕如縷。試看抗戰二十一月。前綫之將領士兵，赴湯蹈火，義無返顧；後方人民，亦能以為國犧牲相勗勉；此種景象，絕對不能想像於滿淸統治之下，顧何一而非追踪當年烈士之後塵，而足以先後映輝者哉！是以革命烈士之事蹟，在於辛亥前後，而其精神之所以振發國族者，昭垂千古而不替。</p>

<p>木軍作戰經過概述與作戰成續，就是說我們在民國二十七年作戰以及二十七年戰鬥的經過到底怎樣？</p>
<p>第一，我們作戰可以分成兩個階段。以時間說，雖然民國二十七年一個整年，在十二個月中間因為我們要改編，集中，開進與展開，事實上作戰的時間，江北算起來經過只有七個半月，江南講起來只六個半月，在半年多的時間，我們作戰的經過，大概可以分為兩個階段。</p>
<p>A是我們的進攻，我們積極的進攻，在這個積極進攻的階段中間，又可分為兩個部份：一是江南地區在我們軍隊未進入以前，情形是很紊亂的，允其是很多紀律很壞的游擊隊，在各地區不僅不能執行抗戰的任務，實行配合全國作戰，並且相反的在這一地區阻碍抗戰的發展，帮助日本帝國主義，便於他們來維持交通，維待統治，所以本軍第一步工作為了能够有力的直接的進攻日本帝國主義，不得不把我們進攻的障碍除掉，將阻碍民衆抗戰的游繫隊解散或整理，我們開始到這個地區以後，先把朱永祥，陳得功等等遊繫司令，江南人稱為小日本的，奉春令解除武裝，有的調回後方加以改編，因為這些障碍的除掉，對於江南作戰有很大的利益，同時因為我們進入作戰地區的時候，由於沒有一個正式的中國軍隊在這地區堅持作戰，反而有些壞的游擊隊，於是竟成了江南偽政權的發展，可以說，除了日本帝國主義者勢力所不能達到的地方以外，是普遍的建立了偽政權。正因為偽維持會的發展阻碍了江南民衆抗戰局面的展開與廣大民衆抗戰情緒的提高，所以掃除這些維持會，偽政權，是必須的工作，這樣才能使江南民衆由消沉的情緒和障碍下面發動起來，積極來參加抗戰。開展江南的抗戰局面，這是第一階段的第一部份。</p>
<p>第部份是全面的向日寇進攻。隨後當徐州失陷，敵人積極向武漢進攻的時候，我們更用最火的努力激烈的戰鬥，在江南戰塲來執行保衛武漢的戰鬥，來配合武漢周圍的友軍，以取得保衛武漢任務的完成。這時候的進攻可以分做兩個方面：一方面向着京滬路的兩側，一方面向着京蕪路。這是鐵路方面。在公路上，向着京杭國道以及京滬與京杭國道問的地區。在江南自六月十八號起進行了許多的大小戰鬥，如衛崗，竹子崗，新　，下蜀，新塘，市東，西謝村的戰鬥，南京麒麟門的戰鬥，進攻泗涇，進攻句容，進攻江寗車站，這些大小的戰鬥，都是我們在作戰的第一階段向敵人採取堅決的進攻開始配合保衛徐州，繼續配合保衛大武漢的戰鬥。白從六月十八日起一直到九月初是我們積極進攻的階段，堅決進攻的階段。</p>
<p>Ｂ第二階段是由於我們的進攻使敵人不得不採取攻勢的防禦。不得不對我們的進攻來一個反攻。從九月十日以後敵人開始向着鎮江與丹陽中間地區寳堰分五路進攻，以後敵人放棄了宜城溧陽等地，集中兵力向京滬間迂迥，開始了敵人向我們進攻。為什麼敵人要反攻呢？我們說有三個原因：（一）由於本軍到達江南地區以後，三個月問的積極進攻，使敵人的南京，鎭江，感受威脅，南京鎮江是敵人在南方作戰的戰略點和樞紐，京滬綫是交通的命脈，京滬錢京蕪綫在我們破壞襲擊下面，敵人交通受了極大的阻碍。經常的叉有我們的人到南京城內去擾亂，這樣便威脅了日寇，他為了除掉這些威脅，不得不向我們反攻。（二）在江南戰區中間，我們所擔負的任務，只是游擊區域四分之一，一方面由於我們進攻的積極，一方面由於四分之三的地區沒有戰鬥或是沒有積極的戰鬥，而我們作戰的四分之一地區，恰恰是敵人戰略上，敵人兵力轉移上的重要地區，使敵人不得不把其他地區的兵力抽調回來，以主力來對付我們，以减輕他的威脅，所以那時宜城，蘇州，無錫等地的日軍，大批的向鎮江，南京，蕪湖開動。（未完）</p>

<p>我想施敎、也同施政是差不了許多、古人對於施政、亂世要用重典、只就說是不但要管、還要管得很岐、俗語說、棒頭上、出孝子、筷頭上出逆子、也自有一點、理由、導之以政、齊之以刑、雖然民免而無恥、而信賞必罰、也是不得已的辦法、在施政的人、自己勉勵自己、當然要進一步的導之以德、齊之以禮、然當了上無道揆、下無法守的時候、就是諸葛亮、也就不能不吃點辛苦、罰二十亦必親　、且顧了政刑要緊、吾則對黃巾賊去讀孝經、我就記起一件家庭的小事來、我有個朋友、呌范素行先生、他的父親是道學先生、所以范先生根深氣厚、言矩行方、朋友個個欽敬他、他的夫人却是一個知府的女兒並不算什麽惡劣、止是個中人、可是他官家女兒、看慣婆媳不合的終不見得十分孝順、我們的范先生講起來、就用一篇大道理、大都只中人的女子、是聽不大懂的、於是每到媳婦與婆婆吵嘴、他到了沒法、就跪到他父親的木主前面、把自已的皮鞋脫下來、打自己的嘴巴子、只也算十足的導之以德了、可是每到如此、他夫人便哈哈的笑將起來、對丫頭老媽子說道、你們看、只一套又來了、范先生三十歲便氣死了、只恐怕就是不能合理的管住、感化也是失敗了、又如近來節的運動、其實我們最高領袖、十幾年來請客西餐、止有四色無酒無烟中餐火鍋一隻、便菜四小碗，還有一位領袖、遇到不能不筵宴、就用一隻一品鍋代替、只也可以算十足道地的導之以德了、然而東也聚餐、西也緊餐、酒肉狼藉、盌盞滿臺、不知還算豪闊、還算敬、規定了八元一席、暗中還貼到十六元二十元、只個以身作則的敎、終於在只個人人失了管束的時候、收效太少、似乎非不客氣的管起來、起來不可、旣然以身作則、禁也不能有怨言、</p>
<p>所以敎育家拚命只顧把理論說得十分高超、却忘記了好好的管束、只無異做了官、只是貼點標語式的吿示、而警察却辦得沒有力量、恐終不能無為而治的罷、且世界上壞人到有六十五、對中人以下的人去對牛彈琴、孔夫子上了當、所以斷言是不可、孔夫子敎絕等人物的顏淵、也不過「博我以文、的我以禮」、還耍「循循善誘」、就是無形的管着、所以子貢也說「夫子之文章，可得而聞也、夫子之言性與天道、不可得而聞也」、若拚命的要想做改良孔夫子，把性與天道、對中人以下的人、要硬硬輸到他的腦子裏去、其實他止看見是一套罷了只不但枉費工夫、而且還有意外的危險、如其諸位不信、聽我慢慢在下面貫獻、（未完）</p>

<p>據航業界接到電吿、（一）偷渡富春江登陸日軍、經華軍奮勇抵抗、已全部肅淸、現東沙洲已無日踪、錢江南岸華軍雲集、防務鞏固、故江南局勢、頗為安定、（二）華軍為牽制日方兵力、特派勁旅渡錢江北進、準備向杭州進攻、業已將周家浦凌家橋等處先後克復、（三）餘姚洋面日艦、近因小潮汛、恐防擱淺、業已全數離去、甌江及海門洋面、均無日艦、沿海安謐如常、</p>
<p>浙東防務記者昨向航業界探悉、江西之南昌軍事雖吃緊、並已發生激烈之巷戰、但浙東之防務、由第十集團軍總司令劉建緒、浙江省政府主席黃紹竑。等部隊、嚴密戒備、異常鞏固、日軍如欲進犯、決難得逞、聞浙贛·湘桂·兩鐵路客貨車雖照常開行、但浙桂直達車、因軍事關係、有停開之說、</p>
<p>軍事影響貨物說减</p>
<p>自浙桂直達通車之後、西南各省貨物、由浙東寗波·溫州·兩處、轉至金華裝車運往者日多、於是滬溫滬甬間貨物驟繁、今因聞浙桂直達軍停駛、目南昌軍事吃緊、於是各帮對運往西南各地貨物、均暫行中止運浙、改道海防轉入、所以行駛浙東各外輪連日去貨大減、各輪船公司為維持航綫計、決仍派輪、行駛浙東、</p>
<p>日艦駛入杭州濁向餘姚南岸姚北鄉臨山菴東等地開砲轟擊之日艦十一艘、因連日小潮汛、日艦深恐擱淺、業已完全駛返杭州灣、樂淸洋面、日前發現日艦五艘、似係路過、並未停留、惟浙東洋面時有日艦弋巡、沿海漁船均奉令中止出海、避免日艦之暴行、因浙東洋面之日艦、途遇漁船及帆給任意扣留、焚燒船隻、</p>
<p>溫州安謐謠言無稽</p>
<p>杭州灣日　集中有登陸企圖、因沿海沿江我軍已嚴密戒備、日軍始終不敢輕自登陸、咋日盛傳溫州之甌江口有日軍登陸之說、航商常電溫詢問眞相、及至下午四時三十分、意商中意公司之康沙義輪電兩、「溫州安謐如常、外傳小確」、滬溫間之航行照常、美達·寶利·棠貝·新生·等四輪、均已於咋日由滬駛溫州、大陸報云、今日（二十八日）為偽「維新政府」成立一週年之日、公共租界各馬路有强勁之巡邏隊從事警務工作、英軍·美·意·陸戰隊·與萬國商團、均與公共租界警務處合作、除搜查隊與巡邏隊自今晨七時起四出工作外、公共租界蘇州河南岸區域、並無此一週年日之</p>
<p>其他徵象</p>
<p>警務處請萬國商團於晨間七時派出、大半由白俄隊與裝甲汽車為代表之流動部隊、巡邏福州路·虞洽卿路·北京路·與外灘以內之中區、直至警務處下令散隊而後巳、外國防軍亦加派部隊、各自保護其防區、以防杜可能的肇事或游行、巡捕巡邏隊之實力、經均增强、捕房特別科亦繼日驚戒以待、預料蘇州河北岸將</p>
<p>舉行游行並有「日人製造」之節日氣氛、日本陸戰隊與陸軍之巡邏隊負責維持該地之安靜與秩序、又大美晚報云、公共租界與法租界警務處、自今晨七時起實行特别戒備、將至午夜為止、如有必要、是項戒備將實行至午夜以後、日機一架、會在中區天空散發偽「維新政府」鼓吹之傳單、又據本報訪員報吿云、昨日下午一時許起、新閘橋上</p>
<p>檢查行人亦突然加嚴、先由日軍官指揮華警、將橋中攔阻之　絲刺網三架、搬至橋之南端橋上原有賣買玻璃紙套（俗呼派司套）之小販均驅逐、並不准行人在橋上站立、日本海軍陸戰隊指揮官及日兵等屢决拔出指揮刀、追逐橋上站立之行人至橋南、有一送石灰至閘北之</p>
<p>華人小工</p>
<p>因停在橋中被該日軍官不問情由、揮刀亂擊、並將挑石灰之扁擔及頭上打落之銅盆帽一頂、擲入河中、有一年的三十餘歲穿藍布長衫之某甲、因身上攜有銅錫、由閘北過橋往租界、被日兵扣留、除罰站外、並加毆擊、甲乃復押禁崗事中、不知如何發落、另有一形似小工者緣出示通行證較遲、亦被日兵掌頰、並擊以槍柄、又令舉起二手站立崗亭旁的二小時餘始釋、有一少女、不知何故亦罰站亭旁的一小時餘、至四時後放行、其他行人如敬禮欠周、忘記晚帽等、遭拳足木棍掌頰等侮辱亦甚多、</p>
<p>今日為黃花崗七十二烈士殉國紀念節、曾經中央規定、將三月二十三日鄧仲元先生殉國紀念。五月十二日胡展堂先生逝世·五月十八日陳英士先生殉國·八月二十日廖仲愷先生殉國·九月二十一日朱執信先生殉國·十月三十一日黃克強先生逝世·等各紀念日合併、為革命先烈紀念節、本市各界、以時值國難餒重、追憶先烈殉國精神、益增惕勵敬仰之心、故決自動下半旗、停止娛樂宴會一天、海關·郵局·法院·暨各團體·各學校·並循例休假、各遊藝塲所·各播音台、均將自動停業一天、以誌哀思、全市市民、茹素節的、推進救難獻金及精神動員、藉以爭取最後勝利、完成建國大業、</p>

<p>大陸報雲、南京「維新政府」顯受日軍唆使、頃已開始激烈之排外運動、其主要者為直接反對英國、日方統制下之傀儡、利用各式標語.巨榜.報端撰文與社評、從事反對在遠東的第三國之運動、是項消息、係不便宣佈之可靠外人方面向記者所報告、據稱、南京近舉行「陸軍日」、會公開請華籍民眾加入是項運動、強迫店主購買</p>

<p>— 鏡清</p>
<p>中國自接受西方文化以來，已經七八十年，何以中國的科學進步却很慢呢？這原因是在國人對於科學的認識不足。以爲從西洋搬些機器，抄些陳法，卽是科學。航空要建設，但不必致力於最理論的流體力學，無綫電要提倡,而無需埋頭於電磁波的研究。國人但知享受西方物質文明而不求西方科學精神所在，所以練海軍，造槍砲，興礦務，辦航業已垂數十年，而中國科學幼稚如故。須知科學非從根本上著手不可，應當明瞭科學的天然奧妙，以充分獲得科學的知識,再應用到事實方面，才能發揚光大，會有很大的成就。若僅東搬西襲，享受一些現成，猶如摘一朶無根的，花到中國來，但可資點綴，決不能使它發榮滋長，於中國的科學有什麽裨益呢？</p>
<h3 id="c91">人類遺傳與結婚 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 星球</p>
<p>种瓜得瓜種豆得豆，這就是一語道破生物遺傳的奥妙。自從孟德耳大帥在寺院裹用高豌豆矮豌豆交配而得遺傳定律之後，這種硏究便掀起科學界的注意，用果蠅用植物終於決定一切生物的遺傳都是由遺傅因基所統制。到了近代就有改良人種的優生學出現，所謂强大民族，得先由改良人種人手，以後的進展大有可觀，</p>
<p>現在已經確定遣傅物質完全由性細胞所攜蒂，曾有人喜言世界人類約十五萬萬，其中精子只有一滴。這一滴遺傳物質造成具有這許多特性的人類，實是件可怪的事。科學上關於動物的受精作用，實際在十九世紀後半期才完全發現的。人類遺傅重大的事項一個就是克力刻家族（Ｋallikak　family）的調査。他先後同一個優秀的和一個下劣女子結婚，所產生的無數後代，簡直前後兩支不能相比。其次就是萵爾頓（Galthn）建立祖先遺傳定律，就是說愈靠近的上代對於後代影響更大，因此對於遺傅的調查工作就很盛行了。前幾年像潘光旦先生對於梅蘭芳的家譜也做過這方面的硏究，述及名伧的成就至少與遺傅有關，（載淸華學報）。遺傅的確和環境同樣是创造人生的兩大因子。</p>
<p>人類遗傅據现有結分果可分做兩方面，但是往往遇到特種情形，也并不是完全顯著的。在體質上，如虚腫，多尿病，色盲，黄胆病，頸大病的抵抗力，壽命畏短，血型，·臀，隱睾病，·生，疝症，羊癲瘋，糖尿症，這些都有遺傳上的證實，但是除了像色盲已經確切證明女子遺傅機會較多之外，其他各種的遺傅形式，雖還未完全明瞭，可是具有遺傅可能，已屬證明無疑。</p>
<p>其次關於精神上的遺傳，這與高爾頓的祖先遺傳說法相仿，在智慧上非常明顯。就所謂先天的稟賦，例如白癡，低能的遺傳，這都是醫生所熟知。反之，高超的知能如科學家，政治家，文學家，他們的遺傳都是很普通。達爾文的家系中自祖父以下五代間，竟出十六位鼎鼎大名的科舉家，豈是偶然的事。龍生龍，鳳生鳳的流行俗談，是很有道理的。</p>
<p>近親結婚，在遺傳上也有硏究。植物上的證明硏究。植物上的證明，因為近親受粉的關係，往往在後代中有不良的結果。我國古來皆信近親結婚，所生子孫大都體質薄弱，精神缺損，蕃殖力衰頹。根據一八五九年裴密斯（Bemiss)調查八百三十組近親結婚，其後代健全者約占22%，不健者則有76%，這顯然指明近親結婚是不合宜的。但是相反方面，要是上代均屬德佳體健，則近親聯婚反而多生優秀之士。因此這一個問題，目前所得的結論是凡族系近具有優良形質者，反而得以近親聯婚而維持其特性於後代，要是近親彼此間遺傅上有可疑之點，應避免結婚，以防增加悪劣遺傅的危險。要之，近親結婚以減少爲宜。</p>
<p>婚姻的選擇與其本身及後代有關，同時對國家民族均有影響，舉世盛倡的優生優育，其目的即在天性與環境的改良。種實是靠先天的遺傅，後天是賴敎育的環境。在這民族復興的聲浪中，大家對於這人類遺傳的常識或許是很急需的，優者保全，劣者淘汰，至少於我們的一個家系有重大的關係，婚姻豈足一件沒有科學條件的事。</p>

<p>降雨或降雪，爲吾人習見之事，然與地面　動植物之孳長，及人類之生存，實有较密切之　”關係。良以陸地之水，幾無一滴非自天空降落　之雨雪而得。苟無雨雪，則陸地上之一切生物　，將悉歸絕滅，即雨雪較少之區域，亦必成爲　荒漠，而不適於人類之生存。上古游牧之民，　逐水草以居，故雨量豐沛之處，每爲民族發祥　之地。及捨游牧而事耕耘，則雨陽時若，尤爲　農田之所利賴。至於雨雪降於地面後，尙有大　部分匯爲溪澗江河，而歸入湖泊海洋，其有益　於人類之處，更難縷舉矣。</p>
<p>雨雪對於人類之關係，旣重要如此，顧自　有史以來，均認降雨或降雪爲造物所主宰，而　未嘗加以深切之注意及硏究。即在歐美各國，　亦至近百年內，始有人加以提倡，而從事觀測。　惟不久即被政府視爲國家要政之一，大加擴　充，歲費鉅帑，歷久时不輟。吾國科學踢幼稚，　關於觀測雨带量一事，自亦未免落後。惟於近十　年內，亦幾追蹤欧美，粗具規模。惜自中日戰　事發生，舉國騷然，此事遂亦未追顧及矣。</p>

<p>（一）　雨量之觀測，係包括降於地时之一切　水量而言，故雪霰雹亦在其內，惟雨量居最　大部分，故統稱之。测驗雨量之儀器，名曰雨量計。</p>

<p>（三）　雨量均以降於地面之水深若干毫米mm計之，故所集之雪霰雹，應先融化成水，然後量之。量雨管中所積之水深，適為雨量之十倍，故設法用一木條量得管中水深之厘米數，即相當於雨量之毫米數。</p>
<p>（四）　雨量計須置於室擴平坦之地，始可得準確之記錄，其設置地位切不可置於高出地面過甚之屋頂或土早。</p>
<p>（五）　觀測雨量，應按日於規定時刻為之，並宜以上午七八時為佳，庶可將所得之記錄，作為隔日之雨量。惟遇暴雨時則應分次量計，並計其降雨起迄之時刻。</p>

<h3 id="c94">人造水晶 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 心君</p>
<p>石英是一種很普通的礦物,成份和砂石一樣。天然產純粹透明的叫水晶，但是也有同爲含著雜質，故而有顏色不很透明的。透明的水晶用途很廣，大塊的儐値很高。但現在可以大宗製造了。這是經過十年的硏究，才有了適當的方法。因此不但重要的工業得了幫助，並且科學硏究和藝術方面亦得了進展。因爲砂石（二氧化矽）約佔了十英里地殼的五分之三，原料不虞缺乏，最重要的當然是在機械設備和資本等等。</p>
<p>水晶最重要的性質是能透光，從紅內錢(熱綫)到極短的紫外綫都能透過。並且經熱之後，膨脹很少，每升高攝氏一度，祇有〇·〇〇〇〇〇〇五八，僅抵玻璃的十四分之一，白金十七分之一，銅三十四分之一。一米長的水晶棒，溫度高起一千度，只膨脹出一萬分之六。這樣長的棒，光從一端進去，可以有百分之九十三從那一端穿出。無論可見的光和不可見的光都能隨著水晶·曲經過，不致大受損失，就是說很透明的。</p>
<p>電影院用的玻璃聚光鏡頭，壽命是很短的，因爲受高熱的緣故，通常在一二日中就會碎裂。改用水晶做的，可以用到七八個月。時鐘裹的擺常因冷熱爾脹縮，使鐘走不準。若用水晶做鐘擺，就不怕有脹縮了。玻璃的寒暑表和水晶的寒暑表同時放在冰裏(ＯOG),拿出來熟到五一五〇，再放到冰裏時，玻璃的會顯出零度以下四度。而水晶的仍是保住〇〇。天文臺上的大透鏡和返光鏡都同為冷熱漲縮的關係，凡是玻璃做的，必須要想種種方法保持一定的溫度’才能得到準確的結果。改用了水晶做的，這些手續就可以減省了。</p>
<p>四分之一英寸粗的玻璃管熱到發紅的時候，浸入水褢，就要碎裂。同樣的水晶管熱到華氏表三千二百度(白金烊點),浸入水裏，冷下去，不會碎。這也是因為熱脹冷縮得很小的綠故。</p>
<p>水晶製的水銀燈所發的紫外綫，可以對著一根·的水晶棒穿過去。因此人身的凹處或是別的不容易達到的地方可以照相，可以直接考査了。</p>
<p>製造水晶的方法是用天然的晶體小粒，裝在一個石罩或碳製坩堝裏，擠壓得很緊密，不致於等到濃度加高，品需要爆裂的時候，各部分散開來，讓氣鑽進隙縫中成氣泡。在一種真空爐裏，將水晶燒烊到約一八〇〇〇，須在三刻鐘以內，愈快愈妙，壓力愈低愈妙。化成的透明渣滓，含有些小氣泡，裝在別一個石墨坩堝裏，垂直的掛在炭管爐中間。用一根石墨棒裝聚在坩堝中做成活塞狀，上面冉加重壓。爐灰燒到烊了之後，氣泡給重壓所壓破，同時將水晶壓下去，做成棒狀，管狀，或旁的式様。如要造大塊的水晶，那末用一個眞空爐可以耐高壓的，水晶放在裏面，等到熱烊之後，就將芪空的活門關緊，歷力加高。道樣就成極大了水晶塊，中間沒有氣泡，要比最好的光學玻玻璃都好。</p>

<p>英國某種經病醫院新近闢一奇怪牧場，不養牛羊等家畜而吞蚊蟲，其目的在把瘧疾傅染給人類。但是讀者不要以爲這種畜牧場又是什麽未來細菌戰爭中的殺人魔養成成所，它對於人類卻有很大的裨益，因爲據試騐有幾種神經病可用瘧疾來醫治，只須用蚊蟲做媒介，使病人生著輕微的瘧疾即得。</p>
<p>這畜牧場裏所畜的馼蟲，爲英國土產，從卵中孵出後，餵以兎血數日。然後把它們放在玻璃瓶內，把瓶口吻著患瘧疾的腿。這些蚊蟲從他的腿內吸了少量的血，便變爲傳送瘧疾細菌的媒介。</p>
<p>嗣用此蚊蚊蟲十五或二十只，放在另一只瓶內，把瓶口吻著患神經病者的皮膚。它們叮皮時，即將細菌傅於神經病人，不久此人便發生輕微的瘧疾。在多數情形下，這種瘧疾對於醫治神經病確有很大的功效。這醫院所用的瘧疾細菌，原自馬大加斯加島輸入，是一種比較無害的細菌。</p>

<h3 id="c99">死的意義 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>今天是黃花岡七十二烈士殺身成仁的二十九週年祭日。，凡是中華民國的人民，當然都是很紀念他們的。我呢，在紀念之餘，不禁又撫今思昔，感覺到了死的意義。</p>
<p>耶穌說：凡想要保全生命的，必要喪掉生命；凡喪掉生命的，必救活生命。這話，雖然原來是有宗敎意味的，菠們卻不妨取來活用一下：前段可以說是對一般貪生怕死，苟延殘喘的人說的，後段則正可以移贈我們的烈士，因爲要不他們的慷慨犧牲，我們那裏會有獨立目主的中華民國、來免除異族的宰割昵！</p>
<p>現在，我們的獨立自主，又遭受到極大的危險了，而且黃花岡也踐踏在敵人的鐵蹄下了，我們在今天，或者說從今天起，應該怎樣才對得起我們的先烈呢？應該怎様才對我們的國家不再受異族的宰割昵？當然，我們還是要追蹤我們先烈的精神，慷慨犧牲，不惜死！</p>
<p>在抗戰以前，我總覺得我們的民氣？有些銷沉；抗戰一起，眼見許多志士仁人，爲了救國，赴湯蹈火，萬死不辭，我就轉向了樂觀。現在，除了孤島上一部份人還在醉生夢死，不管興亡以外，其他簡直已經全體動員，在作恒古以來所未有的大搏鬥了。我可以說，大家有這樣的改變，就是因爲大家都已經知道死的意義，也就是大家都已經備具著七十二烈士不惜死的精神。</p>
<p>七十二烈士死後不久，嶄新的中華民國就成立了；現在數百千萬的烈士死後不久，我也可以預言，輝煌的中華民閾，就可以雄視在全世界了。</p>
<p>死有輕於鴻毛的，有重於泰山的。為國家民族而死，常然重於泰山。文官不愛錢，武官不怕死，國家就有得救的希望。我願毎一個國民，不論文武，在必要時，都會作那重於泰山的死，使抗戰的勝利早日實現！</p>
<p>與其作綿羊的貪生，不如作雌獅的赴死。現代人都應該有這現代的氣魄！黃花岡的烈士，都是雄獅，只有「和平主義」的漢奸，才是棉羊，我們起來吧，踏著先烈的腳印趕上去：死！死！死！從死中去求生！</p>

<p>— 明枝</p>
<p>老奶奶將一大桶飯取了出來，一夥的人都蹲在地上，各自取碗盛了吃著。可是今天的情形，卻有了些異樣。於是老奶奶笑著說：</p>
<p>「你們往常總是嘻嘻哈哈，吃得很開心的，爲什麽今天這樣的唉聲歎氣，好像有心事呢？」</p>
<p>「老奶奶，」一小隊長王明源說，「的確有些心事。不過說給你聽也不懂。」</p>
<p>他們這一夥，住在老奶奶的家裏，已經半個月了，所以彼此都很熟，沒有什麽拘束。老奶奶給他們燒飯，一様有工錢，老奶奶的兒子照常在田裏做活，媳婦和孫子也照常在家中過日子，幫著老奶奶燒飯。老奶奶時常和他們談天，他們也當老奶奶一家是自己人，有話並不瞞著。</p>
<p>「你倒說說看，」老奶奶居然催問著，『也許我竟能夠慌</p>
<p>「哪，」王明源就說了出來。</p>
<p>原來他們今天接到「上頭」的命令，要他們明天將一些傢夥和傳單，送到城裹一個指定的地方去。後天便要四路攻城，城裹已經有他們的人進去，就等傢夥和傳單到了，屆時可以起而接應。但是這幾天城門口的檢查，非常嚴密，不要說不能帶任何東西進去，便是通常的男子，一走到城門口，也就不免有意外的危險。他們就爲了這事，心裏不安，所以連吃飯也不起勁了。</p>
<p>「這個有什麽難呢，」老奶奶還是笑著說，「我給你們去辦就是了。」</p>
<p>「這個使不得！」王明源說。</p>
<p>「使不得，使不得！」其他的「弟兄」也這様說。</p>
<p>老奶奶的媳婦在腰門邊聽見了，也遙遙的對老奶奶說，「使不得！」</p>
<p>「這有什麽使不得！」老奶奶不笑了，決然說。</p>
<p>「我拿得動這些東西，走得了這些路。</p>
<p>「不是這樣說的，」王明源趕緊幾口，將飯吃完了說，「這事很危險，不能叫你這樣年紀的老奶奶去作。」「那末是笑話了，」老奶奶泠笑說，「年紀大了有什麽用？理應作這樣的險事才是！況且這是爲國家：你們在不顧性命打，我這老婆子躱起來做什麽！趙老太太不也是一個老婆子麼！」</p>
<p>這真有些出於一夥人的意外了，老奶奶居然懂得這些，並且有此決心。但是這到底不是意外的，因為這半個月內，這一夥人所講的話，不論是有意或無意的，老奶奶已經聽到不少，便是趙老太太的故事，她也已經聽得很熟很熟了。</p>
<p>王明源一時沒有話說，就立起來對老奶奶看看，見她是一個五十多歲精神非常優旺的老婦人，平常就治家有條理，處事有決斷力，現在立在一夥人的面前，那樣有自信力的神氣，的確使人相信，她可以做成這事。</p>
<p>「那末你想怎樣辦呢？」王明源不由得這樣說。</p>
<p>「明天早上看我的辦法。」</p>
<p>「好，明天看你的辦法。」王明源只好這樣應著。</p>
<p>晚上，老奶奶的兒子回來了，知道這事，很是不安，勸她的母親不要冒此大險，有事還是由他去做。後來他知道他自己的確做不來，而老奶奶又那樣的堅決，他也只好乾著急，弄得一夜睡不著！</p>
<p>但是老奶奶在夜間卻睡得很熟，天還沒有亮透，她就起來了。她本來起得早，爲了要準備一夥人的茶水和早餐。今天則她格外早些，先和她的媳婦將每天例行的事辦好，吩咐了幾句，就走到一夥人的裏面，對他們說：</p>
<p>「你們的東西都拿出來罷，我要準備了。」</p>
<p>她說了，就回到房裏去。等到她再走出來，大家不由得吃了一驚，再仔細一看，又不由得哈哈大笑起來。原來她已經完全化裝了，化裝成為一個老丐婦，身上··百結，頭上髮如飛蓬，固然不要說，而面上搽了鍋屑灰，手上和露出的腳背上，更塗了不少紅蠟燭油和染布的紅水，看起來眞是膿水淋漓，齪齪不堪。此外，她的兩手裏又分攜著一根竹棒和一隻破籃，籃則有一隻破碗和一些破布。</p>

<p>— 明天</p>
<p>天下正有許多事情，看了使人著急，為難，而竟是無可奈何。看到「猢猻爬樹，勿死勿住」，恐怕也是這種事例之一吧。</p>
<p>猢猻旳精神是可佩服的。牠不肯休息，牠耍爬。好好地走下來，還要爬；不幸中下來，也還要爬。爬到旁枝上去了，要爬；爬到頂上去了，也要爬。一爬再爬，爬之不已，爬到死為止。諸葛亮的「鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已」，也不過是這種精神。</p>
<p>我們稱讚諸葛亮，所以也稱讚蝴猻；我們稱讚猢猻，所以也稱讚現在和猢猻一樣的人，因爲按之算學通則，現在和猢猻一様的人，就諸葛亮。</p>
<p>最普通的是賭客。他們贏了錢，想多贏，還是要賭下去；輸了錢，想翻本，更是要賭下去，一直要賭得一無所有，輕則流爲癟三，重則自殺爲止。還有最普通的是色鬼。他們見一個愛一個，今朝跳舞，明天進妓院，一定要弄得傾家蕩產，週身毒瘡，不能見人才停止。其他實例很多，在在都可以舉出來，並且也是人人所耳聞日見的，說來也不足爲奇。</p>
<p>他們都有猢猻精神，所以有人說，「此「諸葛亮」之所以爲『諸」也！」</p>
<p>不過所奇的是，於今交通發達，文化溝通，這種具有猢猻精神之「葛亮」,居然一「諸」之下，「諸」到了外國。於是有些「葛亮」，根本著「六出祁山」的攻勢，一再出兵：大的國併吞了，不肯停止，小的港口收回了，不肯停止；在某一事上佔到利益了，想再多佔些，不肯停止，在某一事上沒有沾潤到什麽，非要沾潤到不可，益發不肯停止：確確實實，要做到五丈原「死而後己」的地步！</p>
<p>還有，於今文明進步，事事超過從前，這種具有「葛亮」精神的猢猻，居然一再「諸」之下「諸」到不可勝數，在中國一大片土地上，幾乎處處可以碰到。牠們本著爬樹習慣，有路固然要走，沒有路，也要瞎闖。牠們拾了便宜，還想多拾些，吃了虧，也想報復，更要西鑽東鑽。牠們在實行著「勿死勿住」的原則。</p>
<p>看了這些現象，只有讚美，「猗·盛哉」，牠們的確有著堅忍不拔之志，非達到死的目的不止。</p>
<p>好得天從「猢猻」願，牠們這樣的努力，大都如願以償。有些目前還沒有逹到目的的，只要牠們果然「勿住」，遲早就會爬不動，不是摔死，便是疲勞而死。</p>
<p>「劉姥姥」吳稚暉老先生曾經有過一句語，呌作：「猢猻弄X，弄出血來」。這種精神正可以和爬樹五相發明。因爲我們在樹下很可以看見許多已「住」的猢猻，或沒有「住」而淋著「血」的猢猻。牠們都成了「一邱之貉」。可惜此「邱」不是「首邱」。</p>
<p>有人還想勸勸牠們，不要這樣爬之不已，卻完全沒有用。蓋「猩猩能言，不離走獸」，人獸究竟無理可講，也只有看著牠們盡爬，爬到爬不動爲止。</p>

<p>十四　重見天日</p>
<p>葉國長的軍隊反攻進合浦鎮來，可說不費吹灰之力，連一些抵抗都沒有，不論那一路都是如此。這完全得力於陳鎮長的妙計，把所杆的X偽軍都召去赴狂歡大會，完全撤去了平時的一應防飼。雖然也有幾個在路上輪流偵班的步哨，但大都來不及逃回報名，便被我軍射殺了。葉團長的三路大軍，浩浩蕩蕩，殺奔合浦鎮來，把·成僞「維持會址的鄕公所團團圍住，那些X僞軍還都被瞞在鼓褢，照常在鄉公所裹面歡呼暢飲，儘量狂歡。</p>
<p>及至一聲號砲，步槍機關槍聲雜作，子彈亂紛紛的只是向鄉公所裏飛，他們才都慌亂起來。這事情，完全是出於X偽軍意外的，他們看見他們的長官忽然無緣無故的都七孔流血，死在外面廳堂上，已經知道事情不妙，但沒有料到葉團長的軍隊反攻過來，又會有這麽快捷。他們原是來赴狂歉大會的，多半沒有攜帶武器，這時彷彿成了甕中之鼈，除了滿口罵著「馬鹿」以外，只有柬手受擒；少數帶有武器的人還妄想頭抗，藉著兩邊牆壁的掩蔽向外射擊，可是他們所攜的彈藥畢竟有限，到了彈盡的時候，便不得不豎起降旗來了。</p>
<p>葉團長命一部開進鄉公所去，解除敵軍武裝，監視俘虜，一部到鎭上和附近去拽索殘餘敵軍，又命趙德勝大隊萇立刻率領所部開拔到東南方去，和朱參謀所率的一中隊兩縦隊取得聯絡，就在那邊嚴密佈防，以防茗溪鎮的敵軍前來進攻。一切部署完畢，葉團長這線輕蔑地用指揮刀挑下了鄕公所門前那塊「合浦鎮地方維持會」的牌子，提起腳來，略一用勁，「喳」的聲踏了個粉碎，大踏步的走進鄕公所去。</p>
<p>鄕公所裏到處杯盤狼藉，桌倒椅翻，殿堂上橫陳著幾個屍首，其中只有陳鎮長的死狀最慘，不但中了毒，七孔流血，而且頭部還中了X軍官的槍彈，天靈蓋都碎了，腦漿流滿了一地。他雖然殺身成仁，沒有親眼看見合湧鎮的光復，然而他的任務無疑地是全部完成了。</p>
<p>葉團長看了陳鎮長那慘死的模樣，不禁淒然流下淚來，他親自動手把一幅青天白日滿地紅國旗蓋在他的身上，感傷地對大家說：</p>
<p>「毋求生以害仁，有殺身以成仁，這一點陳鎮長是完全做到了。他的死是光榮的，希望大家都能效法他這種殺身成仁捨身取義的精神。」（四五）</p>

<h3 id="c105">完成先烈們的理想 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 席夢</p>
<p>我們這個閉關自守的古老國家，由於她內部的腐蝕，所以一八四二年的鴉片戰爭的砲火，經不起一擊而被轟開了大門。喘息於殘酷的封建剝削下的中國農村經濟，遂開始為資本主義的巨靈之掌所破壞，整個的國民經濟亦就日益走向於殖民地化的道路。可憐的中國，從此就像一葉小舟，浮飄在駭濤洶浪的在洋之上，如果不為求生存而奮鬥的話，那末覆滅的危險，眞是隨時隨地都有發生的可能。</p>
<p>但是求生存是人類的本能，中國的人民要生存在世界之上，必須要脫離殖民地化的運命。因此，血債總得要用血去償淸，為求中國之獨立自由幸福，無數的烈士流了他們的鮮血在祖國的土地之上，黄花崗七十二烈士的犧牲，一方面是他們踏着他們的先烈的血路而猛進的結果，而同時在另一方面，也是為我們未死的後一代，開闢成了一條更為寬廣的民族革命的康莊大道。</p>
<p>在黃花崗之役之前，我們中國的民族革命，先後有萍醴之役：潮，意，欽，　之役；鎭南關，河口之役，以及廣州新軍之役等。然而黄花崗之役，却決定了辛亥革命的勝利的基素。</p>
<p>黄花崗的烈士們是犧牲了，辛亥革命後來也總算在表面上或功了，然而，中國的民族革命的仟務却仍未完成。直到今天，我們偉大的中華民國，是已到了生死存亡的關頭：「不是死，就是生！」中華民國的命運是已決定在我們這一次的全民的持久抗戰之上了！</p>
<p>我們今天所走的路子，在本質上，還是走黄花崗諸先烈們所走過的路子。然而無疑的，今天我們所走的路子，是比黃花崗諸先烈們所走的是更加百干倍地艱難。我們今天來紀念黃花崗諸先烈們的英勇犧牲，首先，我們得學習他們的犧牲「小我」而成全「大我」的精神。因此，在我們中國這次艱苦的持久戰爭中，我們如果不上戰塲上去的，不管是工廠商店的大老關，或者是工廠商店的工人小店員，總之，一切人民，都須沉着奮發，來節的獻金，不和敵人往來合作。</p>
<p>其次，我們在黄花崗諸先烈犧牲的那時期來說，民族革命的意識，早已普遍於全國人民的頭腦間，不管淸朝怎樣殘暴的壓迫，然而淸朝的命運是總究完畢了。而這民族革命的意識，在今天非但沒有消失，而反之更為堅强，我們本諸先例，我們確信我們中國的最後勝利是必可獲得而無疑的。因此，我們今天來紀念黄花崗的七十二烈士，我們一定要堅持「抗戰必勝建國必成」的信念，肅淸悲觀動搖妥協的亡國意議</p>
<p>黄花崗諸先烈們的理想，在這次偉大的神聖的抗戰中是一定要給以實現了！</p>

<p>— 納爵</p>
<p>在民族危機日益深刻的今天，恰逢廣州起義烈士殉難的二十九周年紀念，那麼我們追維先烈們捐軀建國的精神，在意義上感覺到愈加重大。</p>
<p>二十八年前的三月二十九晚上十二點鐘，民黨的同志們在廣州再來一决革命運動；事前由胡漢民先生密設機關，主持一切，派黃克强等分任指揮進攻督署；不料事機洩漏，督署方面已有戒備，事遂失敗，是役陣亡及被捕殉難的先烈共有百數十人，是武昌起義以前歷次革命中最慘酷的一次，也就是最後失敗的一次。</p>
<p>當時由潘冷善君收拾遺骸祗得七十二具，葬於廣州東郊之野；其餘數十位烈士，忠骸雖失，但其革命精神，將與七十二先烈永垂千古。</p>
<p>民國十二年由現任國府主席林森將七十二烈士遺骸移葬黃花崗，並為調查姓名籍貫，以崇偉烈，以報豐功。茲將七十二烈士籍貫分析計：</p>
<p>廣東　四二　福建　九</p>
<p>湖南　五　　廣西　四</p>
<p>浙江　四　　四川　三</p>
<p>安徽　三　　江蘇　二</p>
<p>民國二十二年革命紀念會查有徐國泰華金元等十三人也參加斯役，當塲殉難；其籍貫得</p>
<p>廣東　九　　江蘇　三</p>
<p>廣西　一</p>
<p>這次犧牲的革命黨人，竟佔有八個省份那是値得我們重視的。他們祇有熱忱，不顧什麼成敗利鈍，人數上，武器上，都不能和當時的滿淸政府相提並論，但革命先烈們覺得義之所在，惟有前仆後繼，再接再厲，把他們所流的鮮血，去培殖中華民國的種子。所以廣州起義，可說是武昌革命成功的先聲。先烈們從容就義，忠勇不屈的精神，我們要敬仰！要效法！</p>
<p>全國同胞在今天紀念廣州起義的時候，我相信每一個人一定有深刻的感覺，決心承繼先烈們的精神，以完成抗戰必勝，建國必成的使命。</p>

<p>你道起立發言的是那一個，那就是領隊的英雄黃克强。他原名黃興克强是他的號，湖南人氏留學過外洋。身體魁捂面容豐滿，心思兒縝密他的性兒剛。他早年發起了一個興華會，一心要把滿淸來推翻。起事不成流亡海外，同盟會擴大組織遇了孫中山。這一次領命回國主持大事，早決定烈烈轟轟做一塲。正所謂明知有虎偏要山中往，不將成欺掛心旁。會議告終連忙佈置，衆黨員磨拳擦掌準備試鋒鋩，黃昏時煮好大鍋蝦米飯，出發之前各飽餐。只聽得觀音山上一聲砲響，兵分五路殺氣瀰漫。第一路進攻督署二路佔領飛來廟，第三路堵截官兵埋伏在城南。第四路沿着消風橋進逼旗界，第五路監視督練所兼保觀音山。誰知道督署事先有準備，早發出緊急號令一體嚴防。第一路剛剛走到雙門底，巡城的警隊攔住開了槍。一塲混戰把官兵擊潰，賈餘勇一鼓攻到督署旁。裏面的衛隊得了信，硬着頭皮上前抵當。只聽得轟隆隆，轟隆隆，炸彈着地連聲響，一霎時梁摧練折四面冒火光。黃克强率領隊伍直衝而進，張總督忙携印信越過後墻。又聽得號聲響亮齊聲喊殺，衆衛隊手慌脚亂棄械逃亡。看看奪了總督署，忽然間水師提督領兵增了防。衆黨員困在垓心無法施展，首先是吹號的林文中了槍，黄克强再把炸彈擲出去，不留心右手三指受了傷，沒奈何殺出重圍奪路而走，其他的四路因此同時失主張。觀音山放下紅燈命令把兵退，衆官兵趁勢追來似虎狼。一部分黨員退走不及遭擒獲，一部分黨員拚死扺抗陣中亡。只殺得血流成渠屍橫遍地，只殺得天愁地慘星月無光。黄克强知事不妙連忙走脫，喬裝改扮出南關。衆官兵事後抄查革命黨，未走的黨員多數自戕，遭擒之人齊被拷問，一個個激昂慷慨渾不管鐵索　鐺，有的笑，有的駡，沒有一人呈怯懼，倒使那審問的官員滿面羞慚。有一位西裝少年儀容俊秀，可是他的言詞慷爽激烈非常，他說：「你們只知道恭承台旨做奴隸，曾吾把世界大　略作推詳？現在的中國是誰的中國？你情願做走狗把手足傷殘。蠢東西！你憑什麽高坐堂皇來問我？你這回沒死，張鳴岐！你的命也不會長。你知道什麽呌革命？我們是為了民族的生存來拯救危亡。與其作奴隸而生不如為自由而死。瞧你面上堆着笑可知你血冰凉」。駡猶未了一人忙接口，說是：「林同志你眞太熱腸。這種狗奴才也和他談理論，狗才們！我們都是革命黨用不着再推勘」！問官聞言赧然說道：「你們這種舉動够多麽荒唐，毫無計畫造什麽反，到今日失機被捉豈不慚惶」？厮鎯鎯鐵鍊一抖又有人大聲道：「胡說！你以為我們失敗了嗎？嚇，瞧着罷！說不定明天就要你把命償」。問來問去沒有頭緒，一個個從容就義歸了天堂。殉難的烈士七十二位，成仁後遺體葬在黃花崗，中華民國奠基於這一舉，衆烈士，從此名垂竹帛間，千古永流芳。這就是三月二十九日一段史實，到後來才有那武昌起義還我河山。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c110">抗戰與游藝 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 王韜</p>
<p>這次抗戰是最堅苦的生死搏鬭，我們應該在各方面都加強戰鬥而力量；尤其在第二期抗戰的現在，是一個展開全面戰鬥和更艱難的時期，所以我們應該在各方面都動員起來，為爭取最後勝利，民族解放而努力，而鬥爭！</p>
<p>因此，游藝界的從業員，同樣也應該參加在抗戰的洪流　，負擔起積極的抗敵使命。雖然處於魔影四伏的孤島上，但我們不能忘記我們還是一個有血性的黃帝子孫，不能忘記我們的祖國正在苦鬥中生長起來。我們應該站在抗敵的大　下，緊緊的團結起來，為了國家，也為了自己，來負起神聖的抗戰責任</p>
<p>並且，游藝是敎育大衆的優良的利器，我們應當好好的利用它，來發揮它偉大的敎育力量。大家知道，一味拿色情化的低級趣味，已不能吸收一般的觀衆和聽衆了。並且我們相反的可以指出，在游藝塲中的某一個滑稽班上唱着一支「難民苦」，當唱到敵人的瘋在和殘忍，難民流離失所的痛苦時，立刻博得了臺下一片劇烈的鼓掌，贏得了觀眾熱烈的愛好。</p>
<p>可見，在任何游藝部門裏，我們祇要灌輸進抗戰建國的意識進去，一定立刻會被觀衆所接受。同時，也表示出中國人的決心，中國人對抗戰前途充分抱着樂觀的堅定信念。</p>
<p>游藝界從業的各位先生們！努力起來吧！為了祖國，為了中華民族，也為了我們自己，我們應該利用各種不同的方式，把抗敵的意識滲透到觀眾的心裏去！在唱詞裹灌輸進抗敵意識的游藝，才是新生的游藝，前進的游藝，而且也是大衆所需要的！因為新生與前進的游藝，正與復興的中國一齊生長起來！</p>

<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>輓近以來，淨行人才，日益寥落，裘桂仙故去，董俊峰潦倒，銅錘一門，後起無人，裘子盛戎，希望較多，惟近來尙嫌氣分單薄，魄力不夠；王泉奎材具尙佳，惜無名師為之指正，粗製濫造，究不足以登大雅之堂：所賴以支撐淨行局面而聲望日臻隆盛者，環顧南北，亦惟有金少山郝壽臣侯喜瑞三人而已。</p>
<p>金為名淨金秀山之子，初習副淨，不為人重，自與梅畹華配演別姬以後，聲勢乃為之一振，近年以來，更致力於正淨諸戲，大氣磅礴，精彩非凡，去年北上，自組大班，以淨角而掛頭牌，其風頭之健，為從來淨角所未有，去秋攜吳素秋遨遊東北三省，越時二月，獲資萬餘，直至冬初，始載譽歸來，名利雙收，少山誠倖運兒哉！少山之劇，自以架子為佳，連環套法門寺審李七三齣，為其拿手傑作，正淨戲功夫亦不弱，如御菓園草橋關打龍袍上天台斷密澗諸劇，大部從話匣中研摹所得，咬字行腔，一以其先人為法，蓋秀山生前，留有唱片甚多，少山之腔，幾完全得之於唱片者也。</p>
<p>郝壽臣，名瑞，京兆人，係名淨李連仲之嫡傳弟子，童年時藝名小奎祿，會與在大頭（桂芬）配演『取帥印」一劇，極得觀衆之稱許，其名之起，蓋自此始。後以敗嗓，由正淨而改為副淨，因仰慕黃三之劇，遂一意以黃三為法。平生以表演曹操諸戲，享名最盛，故一時有「活曹操」之譽。能戲甚多，如除三害，忠孝全，下河東，賽太歲，白綾計，飛虎夢，法鬥寺，黃一刀，連環套，陽平關諸劇，尤稱傑作，與楊小樓合演野猪林大名府二劇，璧合珠聯，享名尤盛，今則息影家居，不冉以絕藝示人矣。</p>
<p>侯喜瑞，喜瑞為常連成科社第一科畢業生，出科後，亦從李連仲習副淨，武工根底，遠在金郝之上，嗓音雖不夠淨角條件，然善於運用，故紮扮登塲，亦自具叱咤風雲之氣概，唱白俱宗黃三，與郝壽臣並駕齊驅，無分軒輊，丁甲山，盜御馬，鬧江州，戰宛城，霸王莊諸劇，匠心獨運，為其不朽之作；偶與畹華配太眞外傳之安祿山，與玉霜配風塵三俠之虬髯公，與綺霞配十三妹之鄧九公，亦均有獨到處，惜近來已久無會合之機緣耳。</p>

<p>陳雲裳回港展期</p>
<p>陳雲裳「榮歸故鄉」，回港拍戲。原定二十八日首途，嗣以「雲裳仙子」片拍演不及，行期展緩，改定下月五日乘輪南去。俟將「啟明」「南行」「民族」等三公司前訂五片合同如的拍完，然後重行來滬，再為華成公司攝片。此去為免影響滬片營業關係，攝片將以粵語為限，概不拍演國語影片。</p>
<p>袁紹梅續舞兩月</p>
<p>袁紹梅　聘明星公司，行將脫却舞衣，重度銀燈生涯。合約規定自六月份起，訂期一足年。因為她在白樂門舞廳方面，甫於事前簽定了三個月的合同。磋商結果，不允放棄。為此受及縛束，還得仍隸該應繼續伴舞，直到五月底約滿以後，方能轉換環境，開始拍戲工作。</p>
<p>鄭小秋升任導演</p>
<p>鄭小秋前以體胖日甚，不適於飾演小生角色。他從主演「姊妹花」再生花兩片以後，便早改弦易轍，放棄演員工作，專心習練技術。近數年來，他在張石川導演提携之下，久任副導演職務，資以臨塲實習。小秋家學淵源，又兼富於藝術天才。最近，張導演以其經騐學術，已甚豐富，因使獨當一面，升任導演。處女作「夜明珠」片開拍多天，小秋指揮若定，游刃有餘；將來攝成出映，成續必甚可觀。此片主演人為朋稼農與嚴月閒。</p>
<p>吳村將拍玉堂春</p>
<p>吳村導演富於「孟姜女」後，即事專力新劇本「玉堂春」編寫工作。此片故事係將舊劇全本玉堂春作為藍本，參以若干新的意識改編而成。女主角定由龔秋霞担任，劇名或將改為「蘇三艶史」。現俟全稿殺靑，便須着手開拍。</p>
<p>張翠紅演王賓川</p>
<p>藝華攝製　王實川」古裝影片，是早經確定的計劃。關於導演一職，近已聘定吳村担任。吳導演現為「明星」唯一基本要員，此次「楚材晋用」，膺聘藝華，僅攝一片，差不多是客串性質。據吳導演談：「王寶川」男主角為王元龍，女主角經久物色，亦已擬定出張翠紅飾演。」翠紅舊為秦淮名歌史，既於平劇藝術，夙具修養，以前拍演數片，亦尙可觀。藝華任為此片主角，也是一位蛟適當的人物。</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>在以前封建時代，舊禮敎中人最講究名分出處，像曹操司馬師那樣的奸惡，逼宮的事都作得出，但是篡奪的事，却一個留給兒子作，一個還要敎他後人玩個受禪台的把戲，瞇着百姓的眼，由此足見古人所謂「正名定分」是如何的重要了。諸葛亮在戲劇中雖是把他演成個有道術的人一樣，實則他老先生那樣的人格學識，就是不算聖也可算賢的，我們讀了他的出師表，一唸到「鞠躬盡瘁，死而後巳，」這兩句，就不由得起了一種欽敬的心理，覺得這個人太忠實了；同時也覺劉禪個小混蛋太不把他老子的基業看重了。當諸葛先生六出祁山九伐中原的時候，要不是他二番兩次的在後方搗亂，無緣無故的聽信讒言，將他的尙父由前綫調回，就許早已滅了魏吳，一統中原了。孔明初扶先主的時候，就受了　張許多的悶氣，要不是他有函養，也早已回歸他的臥龍崗啦。張三爺在「黃鶴樓」劇中闖帳的當兒，一手拉着諸葛亮，口口聲聲要交還他的大兄王，那種野蠁不可理喻的樣兒，着實能把人氣的發在，後來玄德安然而返，並沒短少一根頭髮，張三爺才漸漸的把他那種　肉時粗野的性子改了。要說道這位關二爺，他是老西，脾氣更扭，那種剛愎自用的性兒，幾隻牛都拉不回來，眼中除了他大哥，誰都沒瞧得起。徜使初扶玄德的諸葛亮要不顯點神通，用些手段，治服了關張兩人，那末，以後的軍令全不靈啦。他們與先主都是誓同生死的弟兄，打也打不得，殺也殺不得，動不動就在三軍及衆將跟前，發他們的　脾氣，罵他牛鼻子老道，呌他這個電師何以服衆呢？所以孔明在治服　肉的張老三之前，須得先把推　的　老二降服啦，才可以放膽做事，嗣後發號施令，也不致受關張的輕視，而貽誤軍機啦。關羽曾受曹操　恩，二人見面，定必叙起舊日感情，俗云：鞕能服硬，　孟德本奸雄，雲長是硬漢，曹操在萬分狼狽的時候，見了故人一下小，（下小即求情意）關公勾起舊感，心不自主的就會把曹操放了。</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、因財部對繼續維持債信聲明、羣疑釋然、同時因南昌忽告緊急、人心又覺軟化、論檯面情形、因大戶多頭堅持不放、籌碼甚乾、論環境多故、零戶及散戶放出甚多、致使抬頭不起、因此市况恍惚不定、在一二角市價內、波動不已、似此情形、雖有小面、亦屬有限、昨日經過、上午開盤、丙種在五十一元內外盤旋、戊種在五十元內外盤旋、比之隔日大致略堅、惟甲種稍疲、買進有潤利樂茂聯和恒孚等號、賣出有五號及三十八號、以及松茂及同康等、洽豐號則賣甲買戊、　價因此擯持不已、勢均力敵、午後洽豐及潤利吸收、天生及同康賣出、仍屬旗鼓相當、在關口盤旋、因今日有一日之休假、乃更使一般人不敢下手市價結果參差不一、丙戊種完全無上落、餘則相差五分一角而已、成交總數、共計約六十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>市價雖跌實銷終嫌不振佔成交額中祗五分之一</p>
<p>紗市仍在平疲之境、且波動甚巨、起伏靡當、忽升忽降、使人殊難捉摸、實則連朝在跌以來、下落程度已深、市况稍定、提撿回風者復來拖進、即刻上漲、旋以客銷依然呆滯如故、加之價格回高、引起囤戶又來出檔、一霎間復入疲途、總之環境欠佳、使得人心恍惚不定、就市塲趨勢論之、因在此五天中、墮落巳二十餘元、暫時或有一度大盤旋、前途若何、還須待實需能吾暢健、市價再作方針也、午後賣戶較稀、但客需仍淸、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤市上傳說紛紜、大都不看好、或者還有跌面、故開價跌二元、二十支雙馬棧單價為三百六十三元半、少頃某紗號心思堅昂、復來拉提、吸收之額殊巨、且放價收進、故市價徐徐上升、市塲陡現紊亂之象、塲中呌價參差不一、須臾間二十支雙馬棧單價漲至三百六十八元、現紗做到三百六十九元、比開盤價均漲四元半、但價漲以後、浮多乘勢了結、又形軟弱、回小二元、現貨雙馬價為三百六十七元、午後市塲掮客頗湧、但成交尤稀、市價進退在一元之間無大變遷、查全日各帮成交統計一千四百三十包、行情二十支雙馬天女比上日漲五角、十支粗紗以津帮納胃仍强市面較平、廠方未有舉動、昨由香港來紗五十件、今日則有十件運港、二百五十件運汕頭、二十五件運廈鬥、各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<p>洋粉亦漲五分本麥開價七元</p>
<p>廠粉　昨現粉市塲、交易漸活、自本粉與洋粉競銷以來、廠方對於北洋帮格予推廣、竟有二度特價之競爭、不免引起客戶之垂靑、據津帮消息、該地市價可售五元二三角、頗有利益可沾、故近日北洋帮對於洋粉及本粉均有大額採取、連日成交總額已達二十餘萬包之多、惟南洋帮近以時局關係、僅有零星點綴交易、故廠盤亦不遷就、聞昨市本街及南洋帮零批價格、仍須四元五角五分、而北洋客盤及回籠貨則屬例外、市面趨勢、或可站定一時、</p>
<p>洋粉　昨洋粉市面亦趨上展、查上週末新到美粉一船、除陸續配銷各路客帮及本街零化外、市上浮存籌碼已見减少、而北洋帮近日需要頗佳、故整票執戶、大都不願輕售、昨開高牌「經日當天」等粉共計四萬包有奇、價為四元三角現鈔、中檔售價四元五角滙劃、比前已見升五分云、</p>
<p>小麥　市塲、擯持已久，連日鎭揚等處、略有零星小票抵埠、貨方以成本高貴、一味扳持、而近日粉市步降、環境未免不良、故售方亦不得不稍事遷就、昨有鎭江小麥開出三百餘包、價為七元、係由客帮辦去、而廠家收價仍在七元以內云、</p>

<p>Fengcheng: Despite the threat of Japanese aircraft and intense artillery fire, the Chinese troops defending Nanchang are still fighting bravely to this day, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army everywhere. The Chinese troops defending the city are determined to coexist and perish with the city, vowing not to retreat and demanding an appropriate price from the Japanese troops invading Nanchang. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: On the morning of the 26th, several hundred Japanese troops crossed the river successively from Shengmi Street and Xinzhou near Xishan. The Chinese army fiercely blocked them, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese army. However, a small group detoured and sneaked into the urban area of Nanchang, where fierce street fighting is now taking place. (Dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Xiushui: The battle on the outskirts of Nanchang has entered a tense stage. A unit of the Japanese light troops, under the cover of six tanks and four mountain guns, sneaked into Shengmi Street southwest of Nanchang on the morning of the 28th. The Chinese field army is bravely engaging them. At the same time, fierce battles have also broken out between the Chinese and Japanese forces in Fengxin and Jing'an. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army broke into Nanchang city last night, and street fighting is still ongoing in the city. According to battle reports, the current situation in Nanchang city is that every street is like a battlefield, and every house is like a fortress. The Chinese army detachment is fighting a rearguard battle and is currently resisting the Japanese occupation. At the same time, the Japanese army that invaded westward along the Gan-Xiang Highway is now blocked east of Wuning. It is also said that the isolated army guarding Guling is still constantly harassing the rear of the Japanese army. (Dispatch of the 28th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: The Japanese troops who attempted to invade Liantang from Shengmi Street and Xianghe were blocked by the Chinese army in Wotou Lane, ten miles west of Liantang. Fierce fighting has been going on all day, and there has been no change so far. The Japanese army has not gained an inch. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the suburbs of Nanchang. The Japanese troops east of Wuning have also divided their forces to invade. The Chinese army is resisting fiercely, and fierce fighting is also ongoing. After Fengxin and Wucheng fell, the advanced units of the Japanese army have sneaked into Gao'an and Jing'an. The intensity of the Nanchang battle is rare in recent months. The Japanese army has suffered extremely heavy casualties. The Chinese army now has other arrangements to inflict heavy damage on the Japanese army. (Special dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Zhangshu: The Chinese army in the Wuning area has launched fierce counterattacks against the Japanese troops who crossed the river to invade in recent days. The Japanese army has been unable to gain a foothold and has retreated to the north bank of the Xiushui River. Key strongholds such as Dongkou and Luoping on the south bank have been recaptured by the Chinese army successively on the 26th. The Chinese army is taking advantage of the victory to cross the north bank and pursue the enemy. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese side has claimed to have occupied Nanchang, but the Chinese side here denies it. It is said that the Chinese army is still firmly defending key points on the outskirts of Nanchang. It is also said that a small group of Japanese troops crossed the Gan River yesterday at a certain point near Xinzhou (transliteration), ten miles southwest of Nanchang. After the Chinese reinforcements arrived on Sunday, they launched a counterattack on both flanks of the Japanese army to relieve the crisis in Nanchang. As of yesterday evening, although Niuhang, the terminal station of the Nanxun Railway towards Nanchang, has been occupied by the Japanese army, Nanchang is still in the hands of the Chinese army. The artillery units of both sides are fiercely bombarding each other across the Gan River. According to Chinese sources on the Nanchang front, the Chinese army in southern Anhui launched a general offensive on March 26, and one of the forces is currently advancing towards Jishan, southeast of Guixi. It is believed that this move by the Chinese army is intended to alleviate the pressure exerted by the Japanese army on Nanchang. (Dispatch of the 28th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: The Japanese troops who crossed the river from Shengmi Street on the 27th invaded Liantang Guashan (30 miles south of Liantang) in two directions, but were repelled by the Chinese troops defending the city.

<p>Fengcheng: The Chinese army in the Tujiapu area on the front line of the Nanxun Qian Railway has always maintained its original positions until the 26th and has repeatedly defeated stubborn enemies. However, because the front line was too prominent, there was a risk of having its rear cut off by the Japanese army from time to time. Therefore, at noon on the 26th, it moved to Lehua, concentrated its main force at a key point in a certain place, and searched forward. The scattered units of the Japanese army encountered along the way were all defeated or annihilated by the Chinese army. The battle results were extremely outstanding. By about 10 p.m. on the 26th, they had crossed a certain location separately and safely reached a certain place. On the 27th, they joined up with the reinforcements and moved into a favorable position to continue the counterattack. After a fierce battle for one day and one night, the Japanese army on the Wanjiafu to Fengxin highway was completely defeated. The remnants of the Japanese army fled in all directions north and south of the highway. The Chinese army is continuing to search and encircle them. In this battle, 400 to 500 Japanese troops were killed or wounded, and many were captured. The situation is being investigated. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>

<p>Fengcheng: The Chinese troops defending Nanchang have repeatedly engaged the Japanese army in magnificent and fierce battles. The Japanese troops who landed from Xinzhou have been repelled by the Chinese army again and again after several hand-to-hand combats. Another group of Japanese troops who crossed the river from Shengmi Street, 30 miles south of Nanchang, attempted to invade Liantang and cut off the rear of Nanchang. The Chinese army immediately dispatched troops to block them and launched flanking attacks separately. They are currently stalemated in a small town more than ten miles northwest of Liantang. (Dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese military observers declared today that the battle situation in Jiangxi Province has reached a decisive stage. Both the Chinese and Japanese armies now have a large number of reserves, which can be mobilized if needed. According to news received here, a large number of Japanese troops have crossed Xiushui, which means that the first line of defense of the Chinese army has been breached. Chinese military figures admit that the Japanese mechanized troops can attack Nanchang under the cover of the air force, while other Japanese troops are simultaneously attacking Qingjiang, south of Nanchang, from Gao'an, in an attempt to cut off the rear of the Chinese army along the railway. However, the Chinese army has now mobilized a large army to attack the Japanese army from another direction, so that their strategy cannot be realized. Therefore, the Chinese army is actively advancing north of Xiushui, hoping to stop the Japanese advance and prevent the Japanese army from receiving reinforcements. Although Chinese military figures here acknowledge the seriousness of the battle situation in Nanchang, they do not believe that it is hopeless. It is said that there are only 60,000 Japanese troops in Nanchang, while the Chinese army has more than two or three times that number. Therefore, the Nanchang battle is obviously not yet at the final stage. (Dispatch of the 28th, Haitong News Agency)</p>

<p>As you sow, so shall you reap; the overthrow of the Manchu Qing and the establishment of the Republic were by no means accidental or fortuitous. It was the result of more than 20 years of revolutionary movement, the tragic sacrifices of patriots and people of virtue, who persevered and never gave up. Their righteous voices resonated and people yearned for it; hence the fruit ripened and fell in October of Xinhai. To say that the Qing government was corrupt and the officials were greedy and the soldiers were lazy, and that it was as easy as crushing dry weeds, is simply to ignore the fact that the insurgent army was not a strong army, and the so-called people's army was not very large; it would not have been possible to succeed in one fell swoop if the revolutionary idea had not been widespread and deeply rooted in people's hearts! Before the Double Tenth, every year people suffered hardship for their words, were imprisoned for their writings, or assassinated high-ranking officials, or raised flags and advocated righteousness; all these revolutionary actions, though seemingly without any achievement, were nonetheless earth-shattering and deafening, and their effect was to spread the seeds of revolution and instill revolutionary ideas; the uprising of Xinhai broke out in Wuchang, and those who responded rose up everywhere, which was the direct factor. The most notable of these was the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29, 28 years ago; there were only a little over a hundred participants, and 72 died in the uprising. I still remember that on this day last year, those who paid their respects at Huanghuagang numbered more than 100,000 from morning till night; and every year on this day, it is the same scene; now that Yueyuan has not been recovered, we look out to the foot of Baiyun Mountain in the distance, shrouded in clouds and fog, but the towering monument still stands out in the clouds.</p>
<p>Whenever I read the history of the revolution, understanding why these people and their deeds were so great, and compare them with the modern world interwoven with realism, opportunism, and utilitarianism, they are completely different; I admire them as superhumans, and imagine their deeds as if they were in another universe. Those in today's world who value realism, pursue opportunity, and strive for utilitarianism take the gains and losses, fortunes and misfortunes, and difficulties and easiness of their own small selves as the standard for all actions; they act when it benefits their small selves, and they turn away when it does not. As a result, the level of social morality and international morality has plummeted, and the world is on the verge of catastrophe, which has its origins. But the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and the countless martyrs who died for the revolution, went through fire and water without looking back, what were they doing for? They did it without considering rewards, and they did it in anonymity; they either knew that they would fail, or did not think that there would be a day of success, but regarded it as something that should be done and did it resolutely; they either deeply believed that they would eventually succeed, or knew that success would benefit everyone, but they regarded death as returning home and did it with joy without seeking to enjoy it themselves; they chose righteousness and became benevolent, for the sake of the country and the nation: how could those who pursue realism, opportunism, and utilitarianism dream of such a thing?</p>
<p>The spirits of the martyrs are not lost. Although the recovery of China was delayed by one or two decades, and China's national fortune was declining, it must still be attributed to the original aspirations of the martyrs who fought for the Republic; even the achievements of the past 21 months of the war of resistance, and the bright future of national reconstruction after the war of resistance, should still be credited to the martyrs. Let us imagine this: the invading country has been plotting for decades to annex China and realize its ambition of a continental policy, long before the Xinhai Revolution; if the Manchu Qing had dragged on and not perished in the Xinhai Revolution, then the invading country would not have launched its military force until the September 18th Incident of 1931, but several years earlier; wherever the invasion reached, the Manchu Qing would have no able emperors and ministers to fight, and the people would not have fought for the Manchu Qing, and based on their ideology of "rather give to foreign friends than to domestic slaves," they would have paid tribute and become vassals, following in the footsteps of Korea; how could there have been any room for resistance as there is today? Therefore, it was the martyrs who destroyed the Manchu Qing; it was also the martyrs who created the opportunity for the nation to revive. Not only that, but the Manchu Qing dynasty of more than 200 years, from the palace to the petty officials, was base and lowly, and gradually there was hardly any integrity in the court or in the people; those who fought in the court and those who fought among the people were all about opportunity and utilitarianism. Fortunately, the revolutionary martyrs fully displayed the spirit of dedication to the nation, and demonstrated the model of sacrificing oneself in action; so that the culture of wisdom, benevolence, and courage of the nation for 5,000 years did not become extinct. Look at the 21 months of the war of resistance. The generals and soldiers on the front line went through fire and water without looking back; the people in the rear were also able to encourage each other to sacrifice for the country; such a scene was absolutely unimaginable under the rule of the Manchu Qing, but every one of them followed in the footsteps of the martyrs of that year, and was able to shine before and after! Therefore, the deeds of the revolutionary martyrs were in the Xinhai era and before and after, and their spirit of inspiring the nation will last forever.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Northeast Guerrilla Force Has Strong Strength, Activity Area Has Reached More Than Sixty Districts, Japanese Army Launches Large-Scale Attacks Without Gaining Anything <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources familiar with the current military situation in the Northeast, while the Japanese army is conducting a "suppression" guerrilla movement in North China, the Kwantung Army is also conducting a "suppression" guerrilla movement in the eastern three provinces. The Chinese guerrilla forces in the three eastern provinces are mostly local farmers, and have recently been reorganized into 50,000 regular troops and 100,000 "farmers' self-defense forces." During combat, the "farmers' self-defense forces" are led by the regular troops. The 50,000 regular troops are divided into 12 armies of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army, which are directly controlled by the Northeast Military Commission, and the Northeast Military Commission is directly under the Military Commission in Chongqing. Li Du, a famous anti-Japanese general who was recently appointed as the chairman of Jilin Province and the chairman of the Northeast Military Commission, will soon leave Chongqing to take office. According to what he told reporters, the Twelfth Army was formed half a year ago by the Eighth Route Army that entered the four eastern provinces from eastern Hebei, and is now active in southern Rehe, destroying the railway between Jinzhou and Rehe. The Twelfth Army has a total of 3,000 troops and is still in contact with the Eighth Route Army in North China. The Second Army is Korean and was reorganized from the "China-Korea Anti-Japanese Allied Army" that was previously active in the three eastern provinces and Korea. Its area of activity has been extended to various counties in northern Korea. The remaining armies are active in the areas of Hunchun and Dongning on the border between Jilin and the Soviet Union. Almost all of the mountainous areas in eastern Jilin are in the hands of the Chinese guerrilla forces. The area of activity of the Chinese guerrilla forces occupies more than 60 districts in the eastern three provinces. The Japanese army has designated many "bandit areas" in the eastern three provinces, and strictly prohibits the supply of goods. Travelers from "bandit areas" are also strictly inspected, with the aim of using economic blockade and military action to "suppress" the Chinese guerrilla forces. In the past two months, the Japanese army has mobilized 35,000 troops to "suppress" the Chinese guerrilla forces, but the results have been nil. According to Japanese announcements, in the two months up to December 15 last year, the Japanese army in the "Sanjiang Province" of "Manchukuo" had 321 fierce battles with the Chinese guerrilla forces. At present, the Japanese Kwantung Army has a total of 250,000 troops, and the puppet army has 150,000 troops, most of whom are stationed on the Soviet border to prevent the Soviet army from attacking. Therefore, the Japanese have a total of 400,000 regular troops in "Manchukuo." (American dispatch of the 28th) Foreign Secretary Butler reported in the House of Commons</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to an official announcement today, seventeen Chinese university presidents jointly sent a telegram to the U.S. Congress today, requesting that they distinguish between aggressors and victims when considering amendments to the Chinese Exclusion Act. The gist is as follows: We earnestly request that, when drafting a new Chinese Exclusion Act, you must, based on humanitarianism and justice, distinguish between aggressors and victims. This new Chinese Exclusion Act should include practical measures to provide assistance to the victims. Without the above provisions, measures in the Chinese Exclusion Act to curb the war will only make it extremely difficult for China to resist Japanese aggression. This is because China has neither a navy nor merchant ships, and therefore has no way to utilize the "cash and carry" clause. This move would only disadvantage China and encourage Japan.

It is reported that the Soviet side firmly insists that any action to "contain Hitler" must also include a plan to "contain Japan." However, some people in the British government believe that if a war breaks out in Europe and the Soviet Union is not drawn into the vortex, Japan may still be able to remain neutral. However, the attitude of the United States will have a significant impact on Japan. (Reuter dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Londoners with ties to the Far East welcome the news of the reopening of Qingdao. The Japanese side said that this is the first result of the efforts of the moderate faction in Japan to reconcile the strict policies of the radical faction, and hopes that foreigners will recognize this as a genuine effort by Japan to satisfy the wishes of a third party. It is expected that there will be similar concessions in the future. (Reuter dispatch from the 28th)</p>

<p>(London) The city editor of The Times drew general attention to the exciting effect of public anger in China since the Chinese government announced that the interest coupons on Crisp and Sino-French bonds would be paid on schedule. He said, "The full payment of these interest coupons is indeed a good omen, because loans secured by salt revenue are naturally considered to be superior to loans secured by customs duties. If we feel that there is any possibility of delay in the repayment of customs-guaranteed loans due in July, then at a minimum, it can be reasonably determined that it is currently impossible to fully repay the aforementioned interest coupons."

<h3 id="e27">A True Record of the Fierce Fighting in Northern Jiangxi in the Last Two Weeks The Japanese Army Launched a Large-Scale Invasion with Heavy Troops on Land, Sea, and Air Casualties Exceeded 15,000, Which Was Not Originally Expected <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Pingjiang: The situation on the northern Jiangxi front, which had been quiet for a month, suddenly turned tense. Over the past month, the Japanese army has been continuously adding troops to the south, with a total of four divisions having been identified. It is generally believed that they must have new plans in that direction. Because of this, the reporter crossed the curtain and passed through Wuning in a car a few days ago to inspect the front line. Along the way, the wheat seedlings were lush, the willow branches were drooping, and a hundred flowers were waiting to bloom. It was truly the return of spring to the earth.</p>
<p>After four months of training, the Chinese army has new vitality. The Xiu River, also known as the West River, originates from Mount Mufu and flows east to Wucheng, where it joins the Gan River and enters Poyang Lake. It is 500 miles long. Wucheng is separated from Xingzi and Duchang by the lake, forming a strategic triangle. It is the inner gateway to Poyang Lake. Although Xingzi was lost last autumn, the Japanese army still has Duchang and Wucheng in our hands, and Poyang Lake is still under our control. On the 13th of the month, the enemy used two warships and two planes each to cover 300 to 400 Japanese troops and first invaded Pingshan, 20 kilometers northwest of Duchang.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 14th, they again used three warships and nine steamships, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, to land on the west bank of Xingzi City, at Laoye Temple and Dashishan, three kilometers west of Duchang. In total, the Japanese army attacked Dashishan three times, and all three times they were bravely repulsed by our counterattacks. The intensity of the fighting and the ferocity of the sacrifices were truly unprecedented. General Wang, who commanded the Chinese army on that line, wrote a seven-character quatrain when he recovered Dashishan on the 17th, which included the line "Ten thousand troops clapped their hands in unison, Wang Lang seized the eldest sister back" (Dajie is a homophone for Dashishan and is used here as a metaphor). The Japanese army's dream of invading Duchang has been completely shattered by the Chinese side.</p>
<p>Because the Japanese army's invasion of Duchang was unsuccessful, they shifted their forces to harass Wucheng. Since the morning of the 17th, they have used more than 20 warships and 40 steamships every day, under the cover of crazy bombing by enemy aircraft, attempting to forcibly land in Wucheng in order to achieve their goal of controlling Poyang Lake and then transferring to the Xiu River and Gan River. However, after three days of such fierce attacks, the Japanese side gained nothing, and instead sank one warship and more than ten steamships, with casualties of 400 to 500 officers and soldiers. The Japanese military has always preferred to attack where defenses are weak. So from this point on, in addition to continuing to try to land on Songmenshan, Hexilong, and other piles, they also shifted their main force to the Yongxiu area on the north bank of the Xiu River to prepare to cross the river. Furthermore, a portion of their troops was divided into two routes, one westward and one southward, to block our left-wing troops from moving east and to attack their flanks.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 21st, the Japanese army took advantage of some kind of relationship to cross the Xiu River east of Qiujin, and proceeded directly along the highway from Gouziling and Xiongliuzhuang to Tanxi. They were resisted by our Chinese army and failed to move south. On the morning of the 22nd, the Japanese army, under the cover of artillery, erected a pontoon bridge between Zhanggongbo and Qiujin. At the same time, a unit of infantry, covered by twenty or thirty tanks and many armored vehicles, launched a large-scale attack across the river to the south. They also deployed balloons that rose high into the air to indicate the direction of artillery fire. The frontal troops still fought bravely in the face of the Japanese army's combined land and air attacks. Therefore, although the invading Japanese army occupied Anyi by the evening of the 23rd, in the battle of Mantou Mountain north of the city, more than 2,000 people, including the commander of the Japanese Iino Regiment, mostly achieved the "silent triumph" that the Japanese army spoke of. On the same day, another unit of the Japanese army, via the Tanxi Shangu Avenue, passed through Long'an Bridge and Baitianpu, and harassed Fengxin via Anyi and Jing'an. They were intercepted by a certain Chinese elite force and completely repulsed.</p>
<p>On the 24th, the Japanese army attacked Jing'an with one unit and Fengxin with the main force. After achieving the glorious battle result of killing another regimental commander Miyazaki and other officers and soldiers, the Chinese army abandoned its defense. At this time, on the right flank, in the Wucheng area, the Japanese army landed successively on Songmenshan, Hexilong, and Yejiazhou, and advanced towards Wucheng Town in several directions. The town has been subjected to crazy bombardment by the Japanese army's naval, land, and air artillery fire for a week. All 20,000 houses in the town (Wucheng is one of the four major towns in Jiangxi Province) have been reduced to ashes, and all fortifications have been destroyed. However, the loyal and brave Chinese Regiment XX and Regiment XX, after suffering heavy casualties, still used the ruins as cover and calmly resisted. Until dawn on the 24th, because the front was too prominent, they received orders to join the troops at Tujiapu and Wanjiafu and retreat to the line of Fengan Changbu Street. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese troops from Fengxin and Anyi simultaneously attacked Gao'an, Nanchang, and Lehua. The two wings of the Japanese army moving south towards Gao'an were intercepted by a certain Chinese loyal army in front of Dacheng Village Qianjie. At this point, the Japanese army turned east and joined the troops moving south from Lehua to attempt to capture Nanchang. A fierce battle, unprecedented since the Battle of Wuhan, was fiercely launched in the Gan River Delta area. In the afternoon of the 26th, after releasing a large amount of poison gas, the Japanese army attempted to forcibly cross the Gan River at Shengmi Street to continue attacking the flanks of Nanchang.</p>
<p>In summary, the Japanese army's attack on Nanchang this time has lasted less than half a month, but the number of divisions used, as far as has been discovered, is five divisions. In addition to the naval landing force, the actual strength is more than three divisions. Casualties were heavy, exceeding 15,000 people. This is what the Japanese army has been broadcasting recently as comparable to the Battle of Luxembourg in the European War, which was certainly not originally expected. The implication is that the losses outweigh the gains. As for the Wuning area in the upper reaches of the Xiu River, the Chinese army has repeatedly won victories in counterattacks. The Japanese army has not been able to advance further on the Hunan-Jiangxi Highway, and the isolated army on Mount Lu is constantly attacking the rear of the Japanese army, and may even be cut off.

<p>(Berlin) Since the beginning of this week, the European political situation has been relatively quiet. Reports received by the German Foreign Office from representatives stationed abroad all state that there are no disturbances. It is said that although the government has resigned in Lithuania, the atmosphere is calmer than before. The movement of troops in Poland has been reduced to a minimum. All German countermeasures have been recognized by us. News has also come from the Swiss side that the anxiety caused by the news that German troops were concentrated near the border has been alleviated. (Reuter dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Most members of the French cabinet today seem to believe that Mussolini's speech has opened the door to Franco-Italian negotiations to resolve issues such as Djibouti, the Suez Canal, and Tunisia. The ministers exchanged views and held meetings all day today, and as a result, adopted this attitude. However, as for the negotiations, the cabinet has not yet issued a statement. People here believe that Foreign Minister Bonnet may resign so that he can negotiate with Italy on its demands as soon as possible. Bonnet does not approve of the policy of reconciliation, but his name cannot be separated from French foreign policy, so the Rome-Berlin axis no longer trusts him. (Associated Press dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday, France is prepared to discuss any diplomatic proposals with Italy in order to resolve the Mediterranean issue. Bonnet said that although Mussolini's speech during Fascist Commemoration Week has opened the door to Franco-Italian negotiations, it has not yet mentioned the basis for the negotiations. French Premier Daladier is currently drafting a speech to the Chamber of Deputies tomorrow, which will state that although France is willing to negotiate with Italy to establish a political understanding, France is determined not to cede an inch of land. (Associated Press dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed sources, if the Italian government expresses its readiness to negotiate and clearly stipulates the matters to be negotiated, then France intends to conduct decision-making. The various points that should be discussed regarding Djibouti, the Suez Canal, and Tunisia, although they do not have to be included in the true structure of the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement, cannot be far from this basis. France is not prepared to restore the status of Italians in Tunisia under the 1896 treaty unless the Italian side indicates that it will follow this approach. Otherwise, it would be useless for the country to engage in negotiations, because if they fail, the current situation will worsen. (Reuter dispatch from the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It is rumored here that former French Prime Minister Laval has now gone to Rome to inquire about the exact scope of Italy's requirements. The general public, given that Laval was the signatory of the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement, attaches great significance to the above rumors. According to people in the Senate lounge, the Senate has heard rumors last week that if the government gives Laval full authority, Laval is prepared to go to Rome in the near future. Since then, rumors have spread, giving the opposition party a handle to attack Laval. Diplomatic sources pointed out that Laval is the spokesman for the French financial community and strongly opposes France's armed conflict with any country. Therefore, it is generally believed that if Laval's opinion indirectly reflects the attitude of the French external, then Laval can gain Mussolini's trust. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the rumors that France has sent Senator and former Prime Minister Laval to Italy, the authorities have not yet confirmed it. According to people close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if France is willing to conduct diplomatic negotiations based on the points raised in Mussolini's speech, then logically, it should instruct the ambassador stationed in Italy to conduct it. Political figures and public opinion have expressed their opinions on Franco-Italian diplomatic negotiations, saying that before France begins to join the negotiations, it must know the true content of Italy's demands. It should be noted that Mussolini's note delivered on November 17 of last year, in its content, in addition to repeating the old text of the 1935 Laval-Mussolini Agreement, has no specific expression. What benefit is there in the matter? The French newspapers generally advocate that the Italian side should first make a statement on the negotiations. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Congressman Gruber, just now submitted a request to the Chamber of Deputies to publish the letters exchanged between former Prime Minister Laval and Mussolini at the beginning of the 1935 Abyssinian War. According to Gruber, Laval stated in the letter that France approved of Italy's war against Abyssinia. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Gayda's Thesis Explains Wishes German Newspaper Speaks for Italy German Newspaper Speaks for Italy <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Gayda, the chief writer of the Italian News, published an article in the newspaper yesterday, giving a detailed elaboration on Mussolini's speech the day before. He said, "The Prime Minister's speech can be regarded as the policy of the Italian Empire, and can also be regarded as the formula for European peace. The key to its peace plan is that each country should revise the status quo and obtain the territory that each country deserves in a spirit of fairness without violating historical basis. To realize this plan, there is no need to resort to force, and mutual understanding is sufficient to achieve results. No one wants war, and even totalitarian countries want world peace so that they can engage in construction work. The demands put forward by Italy are completely consistent with the rights stipulated in the London Agreement. Italy's demands on France do not incite war." Gayda sharply criticized those French people who still hold a tough attitude after Mussolini's speech. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers here continued to comment on the international situation, paying close attention to the speech delivered by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini a few days ago. The Paris Echo reported, "The writings published by Gayda, the spokesman for the Italian Prime Minister, in recent days are no less important in nature than the Italian Prime Minister's speech. Gayda has explained the ambitions of Italy." The newspaper also carried a telegram from a Copenhagen correspondent in Denmark saying that there are rumors that Germany has certain intentions for Iceland, which is noteworthy. The Daily reported, "If it is said that diplomatically, there is no other way to invite the Italian government to explain its intentions for Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal than to conduct formal negotiations with Italy, it is not entirely true. But if you ask about Germany's intentions for the Free City of Danzig, then only one person can answer, and that is Hitler. The Danzig issue is more serious than the Memel issue, because what is involved in this matter is Poland, not an isolated and helpless Lithuania." The Little Daily reported, "Regarding the Tunisia issue, we must point out that there are still 2.5 million people living there, who are neither French nor Italian. These people (referring to the natives) naturally have the right to speak on all issues involving the land where they live and work." The Little Parisian reported, "Our government has sent Ambassador Ponsot to Rome, and the Italian government has sent Ambassador Garriglia to Paris. We think it is time for the ambassadors sent by both sides to be allowed to do something." The Radical Socialist Party's business newspaper reported, "We are neither hostile to other countries nor deliberately deaf, but we believe that we have the right to be cautious." A right-wing French Action reported, "Does Italian Prime Minister Mussolini want to see Germany's power expand endlessly? Does he believe that Italy will not suffer the consequences one day?" The Times reported that there are countless German delegations in Italy participating in various activities. German Air Force Commander General Maedde and Aviation Minister General Goering even regard Italy as their common hometown. On this day when Fascism has repeatedly won victories, the Fascist front may not give people a chance to take advantage of it. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The "People's Observer," the mouthpiece of the National Socialist Party's central organ, recently published an article expressing its approval of the three points raised by Mussolini in his speech the day before: Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. The newspaper also published a front-page article criticizing France's evasive attitude, saying that the French dignitaries imagine that Italy will abandon its axis policy, which is really incomprehensible. It is not clear on what basis this statement is made. The French people's reaction to Mussolini's speech reveals this kind of fantasy about German-Italian common goals. The newspaper continued to comment on Mussolini's demands, saying that Mussolini's demands are very moderate and there is no reason to call them blackmail by a threatening politician. Fascist Italy cannot be compared with "Italy in 1881. Italy's demands are based on the colonial guarantees provided by Britain and France in 1915. Britain has already expressed its intention to fulfill its promises, while France refuses to make any concessions. However, today's Italy has seen its manpower and national power increase day by day, so it is necessary to expand its territory. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)</p>

Ambassador Chen responded by stating that he was honored by the grand reception hosted by the China Research Society and the Far East Association.

<h3 id="e41">After 28 Months of Siege, Madrid Garrison Finally Surrenders; Nationalist Troops Enter the City without Resistance; Fascist Salutes Visible Everywhere; Government Personnel Retreat to Valencia <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Madrid After being besieged by Nationalist forces for over 28 months and withstanding no fewer than five major offensives, Madrid has surrendered today, after enduring thousands of Nationalist artillery shells and bombs and attacks by elite infantry. White flags were initially displayed in the city, indicating the surrender of the Madrid Defense Committee to General Franco. Last night, government troops withdrew from all front lines into the city. Today, there is no trace of government troops in the city. General Casado, the military and political chief of the Defense Committee, issued a pre-emptive radio broadcast stating that the Defense Committee urgently desired a ceasefire and that anti-fascists on all fronts had withdrawn, and the mobilized conscripts had been ordered to demobilize. Defense Committee member Marin also broadcast on the government radio, saying, "The Defense Committee has cooperated with all parties to prepare for the evacuation of all those whose lives are threatened by the invaders," and instructed everyone not to abandon their positions. For the first time since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War on July 17, 1936, the Spanish national flag appeared on the roof of the 14-story telephone company building, riddled with bullet holes. The first unit of Nationalist troops entered the city from northern Madrid after 11:00 this morning, encountering no resistance. (Associated Press Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Madrid Madrid has surrendered after being besieged for two and a half years, with white flags hanging everywhere. However, it is not yet known when Franco's troops will enter the city. Colonel Casado, leader of the Defense Committee, has left headquarters, and the central troops, under the command of Colonel Prada, have surrendered. It is widely believed that Franco will enter Madrid on April 1st. Although the news of Madrid's surrender has not been officially announced, the Nationalist arm salute is visible everywhere. The news of the surrender spread quickly, and the disappearance of the Republican flag seemed like magic. All the exits of the city are crowded with refugees, who are desperately trying to escape for fear of retaliation. However, due to the lack of gasoline, there are very few cars. The streets are filled with soldiers retreating from the front lines. Shops have refused to accept Republican banknotes. Republican leader Colonel Casado left the city before Madrid surrendered, and his whereabouts are unknown. Police stand by and do not interfere as supporters of the Nationalists hold demonstrations. Nationalist troops are now approaching Madrid. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters has received reliable information that Spanish militiamen will begin occupying Madrid at 5:00 AM this morning. The first troops to enter the city will be from the contingent transferred from the University City. Troops from the north, south, and west will converge at the Puerta del Sol. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Madrid The city of Madrid surrendered to the Nationalist forces this morning. The Republican government's Minister of Defense, General Casado, and all cabinet members have left for other locations. Government troops on the front lines have all raised white flags, and all soldiers have left their trenches and retreated into the city. Nationalist flags are hanging everywhere in the city, and pedestrians are using the fascist salute. Most residents are trying to flee to the port of Valencia, but due to the lack of gasoline, they cannot use cars and have to leave the city on foot, which is quite a mess. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>Burgos General Franco's offensive line against Madrid extends for 300 kilometers. Yesterday was the second day of the general offensive, with forces near Toledo advancing northeast along the Tagus River and Jarama River, directly towards Albacete. The Madrid front is bounded by the Manzanares River, and Nationalist troops are advancing using important strongholds near Campo, Fuencarral, and Aravaca. On the western side of the Madrid front, Nationalist troops have occupied Brunete, the site of fierce fighting in the summer of 1937. Southwest of the Escorial front, Nationalist troops have approached the Sierra de Guadarrama, which is connected to the highway between Madrid and Valladolid, 55 to 80 kilometers from Madrid. General Franco fought fiercely in the mountainous area near there several times in March 1937. (Haitong Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Toledo General Franco is now at the Toledo front, commanding 100,000 fully equipped troops, including a mechanized unit, in a general offensive. General Varela's Maestrazgo troops and General Solchaga's Navarre troops launched a joint offensive against government troop positions 15 kilometers south of Toledo yesterday, breaking through the line between Guadamar and Agés. After General Puente led his troops across the Tagus River, they continued to advance towards Ventosilla. General Varela's troops advanced 10 kilometers and occupied the high ground controlling Toledo, bringing its artillery within 50 kilometers of Toledo. Due to the government troops' scarcity of guns and cannons, no Nationalist soldiers were killed or injured in this offensive. Only a donkey was injured and died. It is expected that Nationalist troops will encircle the city of Madrid in the next few days. (Haitong Telegram, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e44">The Changing Situation in Spain is Difficult to Understand; Possibly Due to Foreign Interference, Which Could Affect Franco-Italian Relations <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Political figures here have commented on the surrender of Madrid to Nationalist forces. The course of events is difficult to understand. Although the fall of Madrid was expected, the breakdown of peace negotiations between the Republican government and the Nationalist government was likely due to foreign interference. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini seems to have pressured General Franco not to reconcile with the Republican government and to insist on the Republican government's unconditional surrender. The Nationalist troops, including Italian troops, entered the city of Madrid with great fanfare. This can be seen by the fact that the day the peace negotiations broke down was also the day Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech announcing that Spanish Nationalist troops would enter the city of Madrid. However, the surrender of Madrid may immediately affect the situation in the Mediterranean. Prime Minister Mussolini once said that there is an "obstacle" between France and Italy. Once the Spanish issue is resolved, this obstacle can be removed. However, if the Nationalist government joins the Anti-Comintern Pact, the relationship between Spain and Germany and Italy will increase to a certain extent, causing a fatal blow to Franco-Italian relations and eliminating any hope of reconciliation. This is very worrying. (Havas Telegram, 28th)</p>

<p>(London) Former Naval Minister Toughought delivered a speech today at Caxton Hall, advocating for a united front against dictatorial nations and supporting the implementation of conscription. He stated that Germany has removed its mask, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in his recent speech, once again advocated for a permanent peace that is inherently prone to causing harm. The dictatorial leaders, especially Hitler, have made their desire to control Europe and the world through force abundantly clear. Now is the time for all nations to rise up and resist. "I believe war can still be avoided, but only if nations take swift, resolute, and united action." As for Britain, I advocate for forming a smaller cabinet to expedite action. "After the establishment of this cabinet, all important measures related to national security can be put into practice. In short, a system where all citizens participate in service according to their strengths can be implemented. I am not saying that all citizens must wear uniforms or that all young people must join the army, but the nation must have the right to demand military service from all able-bodied men in times of crisis. This principle must be thoroughly implemented. I also believe that once this is achieved, it will have a significant impact on world opinion," he said. (Havas News Agency, 27th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in Guangdong Province has been stalemated for the past ten days. The Japanese army's attempt to invade Hainan Island failed, and they have been unable to penetrate deeply and eliminate the Chinese army units. They have only established defensive fortifications in several counties, including Haikou, Chengmai, and Wenchang. On one hand, they are replenishing their troops. Recently, several transport ships have arrived, and reinforcements have landed in Haikou, totaling six to seven thousand men. According to those who have just escaped from Hainan, the Japanese army was severely defeated by the Chinese army in Longmen City, Ding'an County, suffering over a thousand casualties. Since that battle, the Japanese army in Lingao, Qiongshan, Chengmai, and Wenchang has had its morale dampened. Chinese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Japanese military camps in Haikou, Wenchang, and Ding'an, destroying their defensive fortifications. Also, before the Japanese army attacked Chengmai, the main force of the Chinese army withdrew in advance and set an ambush in front of the county. The Japanese army, under the cover of air power, advanced rapidly and set up camp in Nanjiao City, north of the county. In the evening, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack. The Japanese army was caught off guard and trampled on each other, resulting in over a hundred casualties. The regimental commander, Kyota, also died in the camp, and a large amount of supplies and military equipment was lost. Currently, many of the Japanese soldiers stationed in various places are unable to acclimatize to the local conditions, and many are dying from disease. At the same time, the miscellaneous troops forced to come south have no intention of fighting and often defect in groups, surrendering to the local forces with their weapons. The Japanese leaders are now paying extreme attention, either driving these troops to the front lines or not issuing them ammunition, fearing that they might mutiny.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Attempts to Invade Haikang</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army on the island does not dare to penetrate deeply, on the one hand, it is urgently setting up defensive fortifications, appearing to be shifting to a defensive posture. However, at the same time, the number of Japanese warships in the Haikou area has not decreased, and they are constantly watching the Leizhou Peninsula and the Qinzhou-Lianzhou coast. They have also sent dozens of rubber boats to the waters off Xuwen to survey the depth. Small warships have also secretly sailed to the small islands of Dianbai and Shuidong to plunder food and fresh water. They chase and capture fishing boats, burn the boats, and drown the fishermen. As for Haikang in Leizhou, its terrain is more important than Xuwen. The Japanese army's attempt to spy on Xuwen is purely a feint to the east while attacking the west. In reality, it seems to aim to invade Haikang. Haikang is the transportation hub for entering Lianjiang, and the Kang River is the land transportation hub from Gaozhou-Leizhou to Qinzhou-Lianzhou. Moreover, it can follow the highway to the Guangxi cities of Luchuan and Yulin, as well as Leizhou and Qinzhou-Lianzhou, making it nothing less than the vanguard line of Guangxi Province. The Guangxi army has recently stationed heavy troops here, and the Guangdong Self-Defense Corps is jointly holding various sections. Recently, Qu Shounian's division of the Guangxi military region has been completely transferred to southern Guangdong, and two other divisions have also been sent to deploy defenses. The highways connecting the coast to the interior have all been destroyed. Bai Chongxi, director of the Southwest Theater of Operations of the Military Affairs Commission, believes that the status of southern Guangdong is important. Although the generals of the various armies have made comprehensive plans for national defense matters, he is still afraid that even the most meticulous plans may have oversights. He has recently dispatched a staff delegation from the Theater of Operations to Lianzhou to first inspect the coastal fortresses and strongholds. If they believe that any additions or changes should be made, they will consult with the local senior officers to quickly improve them. It is reported that the staff delegation is an organization established during wartime and will be permanently stationed at the front, liaising with military officers and providing advice on military matters.</p>
<p>The People of Xuwen Share a Common Hatred for the Enemy. The able-bodied men of Xuwen, Haikang, and Suixi counties on the Leizhou Peninsula are currently being concentrated for training. Xuwen has the largest number, with no less than 60,000 men. Xuwen has recently been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft. Up to now, a total of 1,416 houses have been destroyed in the county. Among them, the disaster area in Nanmentang is the largest, with 1,170 houses destroyed in the field and 44 shops on the main street. A total of 315 households have been left homeless and are currently being rescued by local organizations. They have also submitted a request to the provincial authorities for disaster relief for the refugees. The able-bodied men of the affected families are furious at the cruelty of the Japanese and are all determined to join the Self-Defense Corps to fight the Japanese to the end and avenge the destruction of their families. (21st) Jinshan Correspondence: The Japanese army in Songjiang, in order to clear the way to Zhangyan and Langxia and relieve the siege of Pinghu, dispatched over 400 men from a small regiment on seven motorboats the day before yesterday. They joined forces with the Japanese army from Songyin and Tinglin, attempting to sweep away the Chinese 45th Brigade's base in Qianjiawei in one fell swoop. The Chinese 45th Brigade at that location has over 2,000 men, a sufficient force. Originally, they were taking over the defense from Ding Xishan's Loyal National Salvation Army. After the Japanese army arrived, the Chinese army immediately rose up to resist. Jiaogang, Bochi Temple, and Tang Bridge were the areas where the two armies fought fiercely. All the villages in the area were burned down by the Japanese army. During the fierce fighting, farmers hid in the rapeseed fields and were killed by machine gun stray bullets, numbering over a dozen. The fierce fighting lasted for about a day. In the end, the Japanese army gradually became unsustainable and retreated to Songyin and Tinglin, suffering many casualties. Three motorboats were sunk. Qianjiawei and the areas to its north and south remained unscathed. Four brave soldiers in the Chinese army who fought valiantly have been recommended by the brigade commander to Cai Xiren, commander of the Songhu Garrison, for commendation and promotion.</p>
<p>An Overview of Our Army's Operations and Achievements: In other words, what was the process of our operations and battles in 1938?</p>
<p>First, our operations can be divided into two stages. In terms of time, although 1938 was a full year, in the twelve months, due to our reorganization, concentration, advancement, and deployment, the actual time of operation, considering the area north of the Yangtze River, was only seven and a half months. In the area south of the Yangtze River, it was only six and a half months. In just over half a year, the process of our operations can generally be divided into two stages.</p>
<p>A. Our offensive, our active offensive. Within this active offensive stage, it can be further divided into two parts: First, the situation in the Jiangnan area was very chaotic before our troops entered, especially with many undisciplined guerrilla forces. These forces not only failed to carry out the task of resisting the war and cooperating with the national operations in various areas, but on the contrary, they hindered the development of the resistance war in this area, helping Japanese imperialism to maintain transportation and governance. Therefore, the first step of our army was to remove the obstacles to our powerful and direct offensive against Japanese imperialism, disbanding or reorganizing the guerrilla forces that hindered the people's resistance war. After we began to arrive in this area, we first disarmed Zhu Yongxiang, Chen Degong, and other guerrilla commanders, whom the Jiangnan people called "Little Japanese," and some were transferred back to the rear for reorganization. The removal of these obstacles greatly benefited the Jiangnan operations. At the same time, because there was no formal Chinese army insisting on fighting in this area when we entered the operational area, and instead there were some bad guerrilla forces, it led to the development of the Jiangnan puppet regime. It can be said that, except for the areas where the power of Japanese imperialism could not reach, puppet regimes were universally established. Precisely because the development of these puppet maintenance societies hindered the unfolding of the Jiangnan people's resistance war and the improvement of the broad masses' anti-war emotions, it was necessary to eliminate these maintenance societies and puppet regimes. This was the only way to mobilize the Jiangnan people from their depressed emotions and obstacles to actively participate in the resistance war and develop the Jiangnan anti-war situation. This is the first part of the first stage.</p>
<p>The second part is a comprehensive offensive against the Japanese invaders. Subsequently, when Xuzhou fell and the enemy actively attacked Wuhan, we made our best efforts and fought fiercely on the Jiangnan battlefield to carry out the battle to defend Wuhan, cooperating with the friendly forces around Wuhan to achieve the task of defending Wuhan. The offensive at this time can be divided into two aspects: on the one hand, towards both sides of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, and on the other hand, towards the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway. This is the railway aspect. On the highway, towards the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway and the area between the Nanjing-Shanghai and Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highways. Since June 18th, many battles of all sizes have been fought in Jiangnan, such as the battles of Weigang, Zhuzigang, Xintang, Xiashu, Xintang, Shidong, and Xixie Village, the battle of Qilinmen in Nanjing, the attack on Sijing, the attack on Jurong, and the attack on Jiangning Station. These battles of all sizes were all our firm offensives against the enemy in the first stage of the operation, beginning to cooperate in defending Xuzhou and continuing to cooperate in defending Greater Wuhan. From June 18th to the beginning of September was our stage of active offensive, a stage of resolute offensive.</p>
<p>B. The second stage was that our offensive forced the enemy to adopt a defensive posture. They had to launch a counter-offensive against our offensive. After September 10th, the enemy began to launch a five-pronged attack on Baoyan, in the area between Zhenjiang and Danyang. Later, the enemy abandoned Yicheng, Liyang, and other places, concentrated their forces to bypass between Nanjing and Shanghai, and began their offensive against us. Why did the enemy want to counter-attack? We say there are three reasons: (1) Due to the active offensive of our army in the Jiangnan area for three months, the enemy's Nanjing and Zhenjiang felt threatened. Nanjing and Zhenjiang are strategic points and hubs for the enemy's operations in the south, and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is the lifeline of transportation. Under our sabotage and attacks, the enemy's transportation on the Nanjing-Shanghai and Nanjing-Wuhu lines was greatly hindered. Our people often went to Nanjing city to cause disturbances, which threatened the Japanese invaders. In order to eliminate these threats, they had to counter-attack us. (2) In the Jiangnan theater, the task we undertook was only one-quarter of the guerrilla area. On the one hand, due to our active offensive, and on the other hand, because there was no battle or no active battle in three-quarters of the area, and the one-quarter of the area where we were fighting was precisely an important area for the enemy's strategy and troop transfer, the enemy had no choice but to withdraw troops from other areas and use their main force to deal with us in order to reduce their threat. Therefore, Japanese troops from Yicheng, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places moved in large numbers towards Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Due to transportation issues in Chongqing, prices have risen considerably, especially for imported goods. Cigarette prices: Small Great Britain, Old Knife Brand, Platinum Dragon, 1.2 yuan per tin; Qianmen Brand 1.5 yuan; Big Cannon Platform 3.4 yuan; Small Cannon Platform 2.1 yuan. Rice is cheaper than in Shanghai, costing 9.8 yuan per picul. The Military Affairs Commission, in order to strictly prevent bad people, has ordered all agencies that employees cannot use official envelopes for private letters. Economic expert Ma Yinchu recently published an article titled "China's Silver Policy and Gold Policy," arguing that the government's promulgated measures to supervise the exchange of gold by jewelers are neither adopting an absolute national gold system nor following the old system of free buying and selling of gold, but rather a peaceful control policy suitable for national conditions. However, he believes that the penalty of suspending business for jewelers and gold shops that violate the regulations seems somewhat rigid.</p>

<p>(Jinhua News) The Siku Quanshu Collection in Wenlan Pavilion, West Lake, Hangzhou: Since the outbreak of the war, Hangzhou has also fallen. In order to preserve cultural relics, the Zhejiang provincial authorities transported the collection to eastern Zhejiang early on. Recently, it has been transported from eastern Zhejiang to Sichuan for preservation to ensure its safety. The collection was initially stored in the Wenlan Pavilion on Gushan Island in West Lake, to the left of the Qianlong Imperial Palace. The tall buildings and magnificent pavilions were extremely impressive, with three large rooms divided into three floors, and the entire collection was arranged according to its categories. After the 1911 Revolution, the Imperial Palace was converted into Zhongshan Park, and the entire collection was moved to the Da Fangbo Library in the city. Before long, the new building of the Gushan Library was completed, and it was moved in again. Later, the Zhejiang Provincial Library was established, and it was placed in that library. When the War of Resistance began and alarm bells were frequently heard, the authorities, because Japanese aircraft were accustomed to destroying cultural institutions, sent personnel to first transport the collection to Lanxi in eastern Zhejiang for temporary storage. This year, various classic books have been successively moved west. The Ministry of Education, in order to preserve this last remaining achievement, ordered Chen Shuliang, the director of the library, to be responsible for transporting it safely to a certain place in Sichuan for storage. It has now safely arrived at its destination and is being properly guarded and stored by personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>Of the thirteen Christian universities nationwide, four are currently in Shanghai, three in Sichuan, one in Guangxi, one in Hong Kong, two in Fujian, one in Shandong, and one in Beiping. The student numbers for these thirteen schools in the past three years are as follows. From the above description, it is clear that there are only thirty-five students who are average or above, while there are sixty-five students who are below average. When we laymen talk about education, we want to find a word to help it. How can we help it? Only our leaders can see it early. They have specially emphasized the word "management" outside of the word "education," which is often said in colloquial language. I have a way to deal with the sixty-five students who are below average, and I will definitely make them do it and not allow them not to do it. The effort of "speaking above" may sometimes be wasted a little on the "education" aspect, but it is best to save a little effort. What is the effort of "speaking above" in the "management" aspect? That is, for the education aspect, we must say "it must be done, and we must explain why it must be done." This is when there is no alternative but to teach all one hundred people. What is meant by wasting effort? It means that when it comes to explaining that it must be done and why it must be done, there are definitely thirty-five people below average who have no hope of being able to follow automatically. However, it is best to teach them all together. There is no way to clearly recognize the thirty-five people who are above average, and there is even no way to immediately recognize the thirty people below average who can be guided. Therefore, it is best to put a little effort into all one hundred people and speak to them more forcefully, hoping that the thirty-five people above average will all understand and come to manage people together. We also hope that the thirty people below average can believe and follow suit, becoming good people. If there are sixty-five good people and the thirty-five bad people are managed, it will become a good world. If the management and education are not effective and the education lags behind, only thirty-five good people are left, unable to manage the sixty-five bad people. The good people become helpless and can only care for themselves. The world will become a mess. This phenomenon is because there are too few people and everyone is out of control. To reverse this situation, it seems that it does not require thirty-five good people to get up and work hard and take on the "speaking above" education, but initially requires thirty-five good people to work twice as hard and take on the management, which is the smart way.</p>
<p>I think implementing education is not much different from implementing politics. The ancients said that in turbulent times, severe laws should be used. This means that it is not only necessary to manage, but also to manage very strictly. As the saying goes, "Filial sons come from the rod, rebellious sons come from the chopsticks," which also has some reason. Guiding them with politics and regulating them with punishment, although the people avoid it and have no sense of shame, rewards and punishments are also an unavoidable way. Those who implement politics must encourage themselves to further guide them with virtue and regulate them with etiquette. However, when there is no principle above and no law below, even Zhuge Liang has to suffer a little and personally inflict punishments. And when political punishment is important, I would go to read the Classic of Filial Piety to the Yellow Turban bandits. I am reminded of a small family matter. I have a friend named Fan Suxing. His father was a Confucian scholar, so Mr. Fan was deeply rooted, spoke uprightly, and acted according to the rules, and his friends all respected him. His wife, however, was the daughter of a prefect and was not considered particularly bad, but just average. However, as a prefect's daughter, she was used to seeing discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and was not very filial. When Mr. Fan spoke, he used a lot of great principles, which most average women did not understand. So every time the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law quarreled, when he couldn't help it, he would kneel in front of his father's memorial tablet, take off his leather shoes, and slap himself in the face. This was considered guiding with virtue to the fullest extent. But every time this happened, his wife would laugh and say to the maids, "Look, here comes that act again." Mr. Fan died of anger at the age of thirty, probably because he couldn't manage it reasonably, and his emotional influence failed as well. Another example is the recent thrift campaign. In fact, our highest leader has been serving Western food for guests for more than ten years, with only four dishes of Chinese hot pot without wine or cigarettes, and four small bowls of side dishes. Another leader, when he had to hold a banquet, would use a one-pot dish instead. This can be considered a very authentic way of guiding with virtue. However, there are gatherings for meals everywhere, with wine and meat in a mess and the table full of dishes. I don't know if it is considered extravagant or respectful. The regulations specify eight yuan per table, but secretly it costs sixteen or twenty yuan. This example of teaching by example ultimately has little effect in a time when everyone is out of control. It seems that we must start managing impolitely. Since they are leading by example, they cannot complain even if they are restricted.</p>
<p>Therefore, educators desperately try to make their theories very advanced, but forget to manage well. It is no different from an official just posting slogan-style announcements, but the police are not strong enough. I am afraid that they will not be able to achieve non-action governance in the end. And there are sixty-five bad people in the world. It is like playing the lute to a cow when you talk to people below average. Confucius was fooled, so he asserted that it was impossible. Confucius even taught Yan Yuan, an outstanding figure, but it was only "broaden me with literature and regulate me with etiquette," and he still had to "guide me step by step," which is managing invisibly. Therefore, Zigon also said, "The Master's articles can be heard, but the Master's words on human nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard." If you desperately want to be a reformed Confucius and force human nature and the Way of Heaven into the brains of people below average, they will actually see it as just a set. It is not only a waste of effort, but also a danger. If you don't believe me, listen to me slowly as I continue to offer my opinions below. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Increased by 35 Percent</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of young students in Hong Kong has increased dramatically. Therefore, the number of newly established schools has also increased by more than 35 percent compared to before. The number of young students who have recently arrived in Hong Kong has reached over 50,000.</p>
<p>The Cadar Road Global Student Association declared that the academic year at universities in various countries begins mostly in mid-October and early November in Europe, and mostly in mid-September and early October in the Americas. Although the time of going abroad depends on individual circumstances, it is generally advisable in July and August. The procedures to be completed before going abroad, such as applying for a study abroad certificate, passport, and reserving a seat on the ship, must be prepared early. Those studying in the United States must first obtain an admission permit from the United States before proceeding with other procedures. Because the processing of this certificate takes time, it is essential to start the application three or four months before going abroad. Anyone who aspires to study abroad and wants to know all the details can write to the association for inquiries and will receive a satisfactory reply. It is also reported that the association has a very detailed investigation of the contents of famous universities in various countries and has compiled a list of famous universities and excellent subjects in various countries for students going abroad to use as a reference when choosing a school.</p>

<p>(Kovno) As a result of Germany's occupation of Memel, a political crisis has occurred within the Lithuanian government, leading to the resignation of the Mironas cabinet yesterday. President Smetona has immediately appointed Chief of Staff Varnelis to attempt to form a new cabinet. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Kaunas) The new Lithuanian cabinet was formed today. The Prime Minister is Major General Černius, the Deputy Prime Minister is Bizausskas, the Foreign Minister is Ubšys, the Interior Minister is Major General Skucas, the Justice Minister is Damasaitis, and the Finance Minister is Sutkus (listed as a retired general), the Education Minister is Bistras, the Agriculture Minister is Krikščiūnas, the Communications Minister is Germanas, and the Defense Minister is Musteikis. From the perspective of the above organization, it can be seen that the new cabinet is a mixed cabinet. In light of the severity of the current situation, the opposition party and the ruling party have resolutely shouldered the heavy responsibility together. For example, Deputy Prime Minister Bizausskas, Education Minister Bistras, and Agriculture Minister Krikščiūnas are all well-known figures in the opposition party. (Reuter dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Kaunas) Lithuanian Army Chief of Staff Nastikas delivered a speech here last night, revealing the reasons for the Lithuanian government's collective resignation. Nastikas declared that the Mironas cabinet, which had been in power for thirteen years, had been subjected to a joint attack by some members of the government, officers of the military, and supporters of former Prime Minister Voldemaras in October of last year, demanding the resignation of the cabinet and the reorganization of parliament. After the decision to return Memel to Germany, the need for the nation to concentrate various political forces to cope with the new situation became even more urgent. Therefore, the resignation of the cabinet was almost a natural consequence of the loss of Memel. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Kaunas) The Mironas cabinet resigned en masse yesterday. Stimulated by the current situation, the people of the whole country have launched demonstration movements for days, promoting patriotic spirit. Various newspapers have reprinted the appeal to the people by the Army Volunteer Association, earnestly requesting the people of the country to unite as one and form a patriotic front, holding weapons to defend the country's freedom. Army Commander General Raštikis delivered a broadcast speech yesterday afternoon, roughly stating that there are four essential elements for maintaining national security: (1) pursuing a realistic foreign policy; (2) maintaining domestic order; (3) resisting foreign forces culturally, spiritually, and economically; and (4) training a strong army. "We will never easily give up the independent sovereignty enjoyed by our country without a struggle," he said. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Bucharest) Prime Minister and Defense Minister Călinescu addressed the Supreme Committee of the National Defense Front today, mentioning the defense actions taken by the Romanian government in the recent crisis, saying that Romania is determined to defend its territory. The recent trade negotiations between Romania and Germany did not involve the issue of independence. If it does, we will certainly not proceed. Germany had requested Romania to attack Ruthenia last fall but was rejected. Recently, when the Romanian government ordered mobilization, it notified the great powers, declaring Romania's decision to defend its territory. Therefore, several grades of new recruits were specially mobilized into the army. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, Foreign Minister Gafencu rose to speak, saying that Romania's relations with Poland and the Balkan Entente have recently been strengthened. Gafencu especially cited the guarantee of Turkey received during the crisis, as being credible. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Heavy rain is pouring in the area on the border between the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, and Hungary, and military operations have been halted. However, the government of the Slovak state is still actively mobilizing its air force and air defense forces, and has published notices in various newspapers, calling up specialist reservists. Regarding the boundary demarcation issue, after the Slovak representative delegation arrived in the capital of Hungary, it notified the Hungarian authorities that if the country's troops do not withdraw completely, the Slovak state will be unable to conduct negotiations. The chief representative of the delegation also telegraphed the state's Foreign Minister Černák, stating that the following three requests would be made: (1) demarcating the boundary line; (2) demanding compensation for damages; (3) determining responsibility for the incident.

<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that Kino, a 36-year-old Japanese national and deputy director of the Chinese personnel section of the No. 3 Factory of the Shanghai Textile Company, was riding in a rickshaw along Linqing Road at 7:40 this morning when he was shot near Hangzhou Road. The bullet pierced his head, and he was critically wounded. The assailant immediately fled. The Japanese military police immediately carried the wounded man to the headquarters on Huacheng Road, and then transferred him to the affiliated hospital of a certain yarn factory, where he</p>
<p>died immediately.</p>
<p>After the shooting, traffic was immediately halted. The Japanese authorities stopped all vehicles coming and going in Yangshupu, inspecting them, so all roads were extremely congested. This ended at about 9:30. As a result of the incident, the Japanese authorities immediately ordered martial law to be implemented north of the Suzhou Creek. Japanese marines and military police set up a cordon at the shooting location. Rickshaw pullers and several Chinese people nearby were</p>
<p>detained for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department is assisting the Japanese military police in investigating this case. Their only clue is a single shell casing. According to the news agency, at around 6:00 a.m. yesterday morning, Japanese marines suddenly deployed sentries and searched houses along Yangshupu Road and Linqing Road, waking up the residents. However, after the search,</p>
<p>nothing was found.</p>
<p>It has been learned that Makino, the Japanese director of the personnel section of the No. 2 Factory of the Shanghai Textile Company, was walking with a woman to the intersection of Linqing Road and Zhoujiazui Road yesterday morning when several gunshots suddenly rang out. Makino was shot three times and fell to the ground and died; the woman was not injured. After receiving the report, the Japanese authorities sent a large contingent of Japanese soldiers to conduct a major search.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Fierce Anti-Foreign Movement Begins in Nanjing; Opposition to Britain Is Particularly Blatant; Clearly Under the Direction of the Japanese Military <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>*The Continental Times* reports that the Nanjing "Reformed Government," apparently instigated by the Japanese military, has recently begun a fierce anti-foreign movement, the main target of which is direct opposition to Britain. Puppets under Japanese control are using various slogans, large posters, newspaper articles, and editorials to engage in a movement against third countries in the Far East. This information was reported to the reporter by a reliable foreign source who is not allowed to be named. It is said that Nanjing recently held an "Army Day" and publicly invited Chinese civilians to join this movement, forcing shopkeepers to purchase</p>
<p>anti-foreign posters.</p>
<p>Police officers are forcing rickshaws and all vehicles to put up slogans, and during the "New Order Week" parade, leaflets denouncing third countries are widely distributed. People in Nanjing are forced to join the parade, and participants are given three sheng of rice, or even cash, to reward their "loyalty." However, those who participate in the parade are mostly beggars and local ruffians. According to equally reliable foreign sources, similar anti-foreign parades have also been held in other county towns along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway for the past ten days. Newspaper criticism and the text published on the front page are directly</p>
<p>opposed to Britain.</p>
<p>"White imperialism" is being denounced by all. After publishing a fierce anti-British editorial, the Nanjing official publication *Xin Bao* (transliteration) reprinted the following slogans in bold type: (1) Tear down the British flag; (2) Boycott British goods; (3) Confiscate British property in China; (4) Take back all British concessions; (5) Expel British people from the country; (6) Vow not to cooperate with the British. Prior to this, newspapers had also written articles requesting Chinese people employed in British businesses and British consulates to resign, and published detailed plans</p>
<p>for providing subsistence allowances if they lost their jobs as a result of resigning.</p>
<p>When the Japanese spokesman received reporters last night, he replied to questions about anti-British propaganda in Nanjing newspapers, saying that he had not heard of this before. When a reporter asked if the spokesman would investigate the matter and take appropriate action, the spokesman replied, "Yes, but the investigation will take some time." It is also heard that the sale of narcotics in Nanjing is still rampant. Currently, heroin seems to be less available, but opium is even more abundant than before. After Dr. Fisk exposed the narcotics situation last autumn, the Japanese have mostly removed public narcotics advertisements, and newspapers no longer carry advertisements. However, although there is less publicity now, the</p>
<p>trade continues</p>
<p>. Narcotics agencies now use only a simple sign saying "Earth Shop," and there is a very large amount of unregistered narcotics trade that avoids paying some taxes. The Samsung Company at No. 49 Taiping Road and two other earth shops are the most prominent in this business. It is also heard that every day from fifteen to one hundred and fifty wounded or sick Japanese soldiers are transported from the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway to Shanghai. Some of them were wounded in battles with guerrillas, and some were wounded in battles upstream of the Yangtze River, while others were suffering from ordinary illnesses. After each major battle upstream of the Yangtze River, the number of wounded soldiers is particularly high. The Chinese guerrillas closest to Nanjing are about thirty miles away. They and the Japanese army do not pay much attention to each other.</p>

<p>The French-language *Journal de Shanghai* reported on the 28th that at a Japanese military press briefing last night, an American foreign reporter pressed the Japanese military spokesman hard, asking whether the repeated bombing of church property in various places by Japanese military aircraft was intentional. The reporter also asked if, according to general speculation, the destruction of foreign property by the Japanese military was in fact intentional, with the aim of gradually forcing foreign forces to withdraw from China by this means. At that time, the Japanese military spokesman, hearing this question, looked very displeased and strongly claimed that this kind of speculation had no basis whatsoever and was purely intended to undermine the relationship between the Japanese military and foreigners. The spokesman also claimed that the Japanese military's expulsion of foreign forces from China was in fact mostly due to misunderstandings. Finally, the spokesman said that Qingdao has recently been opened, allowing foreigners to do business, which shows that the Japanese military has no intention of excluding foreigners from "legitimate business" in China.</p>

<p>*The Continental Times* reports that Mrs. Moore, an employee of the Japanese English *Kochi News*, who will travel throughout Central China, North China, and the Three Northeastern Provinces, arrived here a few days ago. Yesterday (27th), she told reporters about the wartime situation in Japan, saying that the number of Japanese men going to the front lines in China has increased sharply, so men's positions in Japanese industrial organizations are now being replaced by women. Male ticket collectors on Tokyo buses have all been drafted into the army, and their positions are now filled by women. In many factories, women are doing heavy work that was previously done by men. The prosperity of geisha businesses in Japan is unprecedented. There are now thousands more geishas than before. The standard of living in Japan is higher than in China. The Japanese are a war-loving people, but there are still pacifists in the country who oppose war. The Japanese generally have a limited understanding of the situation in China, as all newspapers are subject to strict censorship. Everything is subject to control, according to Mrs. Moore, who has lived in Japan for two wars. She will stay in Shanghai for several days and then travel to the Three Northeastern Provinces via Dalian, returning to work in about six weeks.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Developing Overseas Trade; Government Encourages Production; Important Local Products Gathered in Hong Kong for Large-Scale Export; Executive Yuan Will Convene a National Production Conference <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan will convene a National Production Conference, striving to make all production enterprises in the country more and more prosperous, so as to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance and National Construction. Management offices have been established in various provinces to be responsible for production matters. Important local products are all concentrated in Hong Kong by the Export and Trade Committee for export. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tung Oil Tung oil is one of China's special products, and is a necessary product for the paint industry. Recently, our country's loan to the United States uses tung oil as the main guarantee. Production areas such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Sichuan, etc., have been working hard to produce. Last year, the output value was 39.237 million yuan in national currency. From January to February this year, the output value was 3.484 million yuan in national currency, of which the value of exports to Hong Kong for transshipment was 33.96 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Tea Tea is mostly produced in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Zhejiang. During the War of Resistance, after the authorities actively developed it, last year's exports not only did not decrease due to the war, but actually increased by 2.26 million yuan. The Japanese dream of destroying our tea production areas and trying to occupy overseas sales fields has been shattered without a trace. This year, our foreign trade has been actively developed, and management offices have been established in various provinces to increase production. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 1.167 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Mineral Sands Mineral sand production areas are concentrated at the junction of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Hunan provinces. Although the flames of war swept across the country last year, under active development, the output did not decrease due to the war, and the export volume did not decrease due to transportation difficulties. Last year's exports were valued at 10.2452 million yuan in national currency, an increase of 5.571 million yuan compared with the previous year. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 14.157 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials In addition to domestic sales, medicinal materials are shipped to the places where overseas Chinese live every year, such as Malaysia, Annam, Siam, the Americas, etc., in large quantities, and are all exported from Hong Kong. Sichuan produces the most. Last year's exports were valued at 11.443 million yuan in national currency, a decrease of 405,000 yuan compared with the previous year. From January to March this year, exports were valued at 1.83 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Raw Silk The silk production areas are Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as Guangdong, Shandong, and Sichuan. After the war, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, and other provinces were occupied. In the areas that have not been lost, the authorities actively encourage farmers to increase production, and guide farmers in breeding silkworms and reeling silk in several inland provinces. Currently, sericulture management offices have been established in Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, and other provinces to specifically handle sericulture matters. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 10.565 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Egg Products The export of egg products flourished during World War I, including dry and wet egg white, egg yolk, fresh eggs, frozen eggs, etc. Their uses are either for food or as industrial raw materials. The export season is mostly in spring, as the climate is more suitable. Last year's exports were valued at 48.96 million yuan in national currency. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 7.022 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Animal Casings The export of animal casings is a matter of the past 20 years or so. During the European War, all countries felt a shortage of food and sought to supplement it from other countries. Chinese animal casings also began to be exported at this time to supply various countries. The export ports are concentrated in Shanghai and Tianjin. The intestine industry was greatly affected by the outbreak of the war. Foreign firms took the opportunity to set up factories and manufacture them themselves, but due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials, they did not achieve much. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 1.97 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Cotton Cotton has always been concentrated in the three major commercial ports of Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin. Most of it was sold to Japan and its territories. In addition to industrial raw materials, smokeless gunpowder and other products also used cotton as raw materials. After the Japanese puppets gained control in North and Central China, a large amount of cotton was exported to Japan. Last year, it was valued at 89.897 million yuan in national currency. From January to February this year, it was valued at 2.926 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Pig Bristles Pig bristles are the basic raw material for making brushes, and are divided into black and white. Sichuan and Hunan provinces are the main production areas. Initially, British and Japanese merchants operated the exports, and later some Chinese also operated them. Most of them are sold to the United States, accounting for half of the export value, followed by Britain, etc. However, very few are exported to Japan. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 4.7 million yuan in national currency, an increase of 1.8 million yuan compared with the same period last year.</p>

<p>In the past week, the police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have been conducting exceptionally thorough search operations within their territories, day and night, taking shifts to go out on patrol. Anyone even slightly suspected is subject to investigation. As a result, petty thieves have disappeared, and theft cases have been solved repeatedly. They are paying even closer attention to the border areas and public places. At around 8:30 PM last night, the Public Concession reserve team and search team police, under a temporary emergency assembly order, joined with the White Russian squad of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and set off together to the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII for another search. Even the search personnel did not initially know where they were going. After the police vehicles arrived at their destination, police officers directed the Volunteer Corps to take charge of security. All the police reserve teams were immediately divided into several small teams and began to thoroughly search the hotel's various floors and guest rooms.

<p>A fire suddenly broke out at the intersection of Guangxi Road and Hankou Road at around 4:40 AM yesterday. At the time, it was not yet dawn, and laborers were all asleep, so they were initially unaware. It was only when nearby patrol officers noticed white smoke coming from the burning building that they discovered it and rushed to knock on doors and shout. However, the fire inside had already spread and was beyond control. Before long, it broke through the roof and spread to neighboring buildings. Zhang Daxin, a</p>
<p>Ningbo Apprentice</p>
<p>at the Shuren Jewelry Store at numbers 6 and 7, was sleeping upstairs. Once startled awake, he saw that the ladder had been burned through and he could not get downstairs. He jumped out of the window, causing a jaw injury and was sent to the hospital for treatment. At this time, neighbors to the left and right were also awakened one after another and fled, grabbing clothes and rushing out the door. Some were rescuing business ledgers, while others were carrying important boxes and cabinets as they ran.</p>
<p>Shouting and Screaming,</p>
<p>it was a scene of utter chaos. Upon receiving the alarm, the Central Fire Brigade immediately ordered all firefighters to mobilize and drive to the scene to extinguish the fire. However, at this moment, the wind was raging, so the fire used the wind to increase its ferocity. All the neighbors to the left and right, such as the Hengchang Department Store at number 272 on Guangxi Road, the Guanghua Electrical and Plumbing Supplies store at numbers 274 to 276, the Yuanchang Hardware Store at number 278, and the Lao Rongtai</p>
<p>Cosmetics Store</p>
<p>at numbers 672 and 674 on Hankou Road, as well as number 676 and part of the Lianyuan Hotel in the alley behind the Shuren Bookstore, were all caught in the flames. The flames soared, and the fire blazed into the sky. Moreover, the goods in the stores on fire were highly flammable, so extinguishing the fire for a long time was ineffective. At the same time, the firefighters learned that men and women were still trapped inside each burning building, so they had to focus on rescuing people, running back and forth, working extremely hard. After about two hours of</p>
<p>Courageous Firefighting,</p>
<p>the fire was gradually extinguished. As a result, all the affected families suffered enormous losses. Most unfortunately, none of the men and women inside the buildings where the fire started were seen escaping and are believed to have perished in the fire. Firefighters then began digging and found one male corpse at the scene. Yesterday morning, they continued to find two more corpses. One was charred beyond recognition, but according to acquaintances, they were all employees of the Lao Rongtai Cosmetics Store. The three corpses have been</p>
<p>Sent to the Morgue</p>
<p>for examination. In addition, it is rumored that there are two more unidentifiable bodies that are currently being investigated. As for the cause of the fire, there are also varying rumors, and the police are conducting separate interviews and a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that at around 11:15 AM today (the 28th), four Japanese in plainclothes shot and killed one Chinese farmer and injured another on Hongqiao Road. Foreigners passing by the area saw the deceased's body and the injured person, who was tightly bound on a rickshaw to prevent his escape, lying on the roadside. The four Japanese, dressed in Chinese clothing, were riding bicycles. It was unclear whether they were Japanese soldiers or mercenaries. They were inspecting pedestrians on Hongqiao Road. According to witnesses, the two Chinese were clearly farmers walking along Hongqiao Road. Upon seeing the inspection team, they hesitated and paid attention to these four individuals, who appeared to be Chinese. Unwilling to be inspected or questioned by the Japanese, they turned around to leave. The four Japanese then pulled out handguns and fired at them. One Chinese man fell to the ground and died, while the other was injured but managed to escape. He was then captured and tied up. Thirty minutes later, one of the Japanese summoned a car and took the Chinese man to the Japanese military headquarters, along with the corpse.</p>

<p>On the night of January 15 of this year, the Yitaixing Coal Yard on Xinza Road was robbed of 30,000 yuan in legal tender. Later, police detectives, accompanied by Hu Tingxiang and Meng Zhenjia, employees of the coal yard, investigated the gang of thieves on various roads and public places. When they passed the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hardoon Road, Hu and Meng saw that the</p>

However, upon further investigation, it was learned that the person arrested was named Lin Jiabin, the owner of the Fuhua Hosiery Factory, and had no connection to the robbery. He was immediately released. However, Lin, feeling aggrieved that he had been detained for a week due to the identification by Hu and others,</p>

<p>hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Lu Qi to file a lawsuit against Shen Jinzhou, the manager of Yitaixing, as well as Hu Tingxiang and Meng Zhenjia, for perjury and false accusation in the First Special District Court. On the other hand, the defendants also hired lawyers Li Guozhen, Yu Ting, and Li Yujun to defend them, arguing that Shen Jinzhou had never participated in the identification process and therefore could not be accused of false accusation. Moreover, Hu and Meng were not intentionally framing him and did not</p>

Afterward, according to Jiang, after dinner, he went out to get some water when he suddenly encountered several bandits in the dark who intended to rob him. He resisted with all his might, incurring the hatred of the thugs, who then drew their guns and shot him, causing his injuries.</p>

<p>The puppet government is facing increasing financial difficulties.

Last month, the puppet "Police Bureau" made a massive cut of over one hundred puppet police officers. The puppet "District Public Office" was also entirely placed on "leave with pay." This month, the puppet "Education Bureau" has also suffered the same fate, cutting two puppet "Chief Section Chiefs," eight puppet "Section Chiefs," twelve "Clerks," and six puppet "Medical Aides." The puppet "Section Chief" of the puppet Second Section has also been forced to leave his puppet "post."

Therefore, several years ago, it established a Sinology Department within the firm's organizational structure to study Chinese culture and social issues so that it can respond to and contribute to Sino-German relations in the future. It is heard that the department is divided into two units: one is called the Chinese Language Group, and all German staff members of the firm must join this group and study Chinese language and writing. The highest standard is to be able to speak fluent Chinese Mandarin and draft ordinary Chinese documents. The other unit is called the Translation Group, which specializes in collecting important books, periodicals, and newspapers related to China for the firm's authorities to reference. In addition, various materials are collected, translated, and archived. It is heard that the Sinology Department held its annual banquet on the 15th of this month at the Tai Lai Restaurant on the Fourth Horse Road, chaired by Mr. Ledes (Mr. Li is one of the managers of Youfu Foreign Company and concurrently serves as the director of the Sinology Department). Attendees included Mr. Fulaise (Mr. Fu is the supervisor of the Sinology Department) and many other staff members of the firm. During the banquet, many methods for improving the firm were discussed and agreed upon.</p>

<h3 id="e84">A Visit to the Cheng Teh Pharmaceutical Factory <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Teh Pharmaceutical Factory's pure and mixed Gui Guai Kang Fu Duo liquid, a targeted domestic tonic and cough remedy, has recently undergone a lengthy research and development process, resulting in the invention of sugar-coated Kang Fu Duo tablets, which are convenient to carry and easy to take. As a result, business is booming. Considering that the domestic pharmaceutical industry is still in its infancy, the factory's products not only rival foreign goods but also represent further innovation, demonstrating a commendable spirit of hard work and progress. Our reporter recently took a trip to visit the factory and will briefly describe the production process and facilities below for your information.</p>
<p>Laboratory: Upon arriving at the factory, we were greeted by Mr. Chen Xingwu, the factory manager, and Mr. Zuo Gu'er, a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, who first showed us the laboratory. They explained that for modern medicines to remain effective over time, the raw materials must be properly identified and the ingredients must be combined according to established standards. After production, the ingredients must still be tested to ensure consistent quality and effectiveness. Therefore, the factory pays close attention to the laboratory's facilities, which include reference books, precise analytical instruments, refrigerated storage, ultraviolet lamps, and more. In addition to the three products currently available—Kang Fu Duo tablets, liquid, and infant tablets—the factory is actively engaged in research on several imported specialty drugs. As a result, several chemists in the laboratory are busy at work, in an orderly and well-organized manner.</p>
<p>Preparation Room: In the preparation room, super-strength cod liver oil is being extracted using a small electric heating vacuum distiller. On average, one kilogram of super-strength cod liver oil can be extracted from each kilogram of concentrated cod liver oil. This extract is added to Kang Fu Duo tablets, ensuring that each tablet contains at least 500,000 international units of Vitamin A. Therefore, the medicinal effect of each tablet is comparable to one tablespoon of Kang Fu Duo liquid. Additionally, electric tablet testing machines, electric mixers, filters, and other equipment are fully equipped.</p>
<p>Extraction Room: This room is used for raw material extraction and mixing. Several raw materials in Kang Fu Duo liquid, such as wild cherry bark powder, must be extracted for their active ingredients before they can be used in the formula. The room contains over forty blue vats, which are used to hold the extracted ingredients and to mix the raw materials. After the extracted ingredients are prepared, they are combined with nourishing ingredients such as malt extract, calcium, iron, potassium, manganese, and quinine. After careful mixing and blending, the mixture is poured into a transport funnel and flows into a centrifugal clarifier in the mechanized workshop for clarification.</p>
<p>Mechanized Workshop: The centrifugal clarifier in this room is designed based on the principle of centrifugal force in physics. Its storage device can completely remove even the finest impurities from Kang Fu Duo. As a result, the Kang Fu Duo liquid is exceptionally pure and does not produce sediment even after long storage. After being clarified, the Kang Fu Duo is poured into an electric automatic conveyor, which lifts it to the packaging room on the second floor for further packaging. The structure of this conveyor is extremely ingenious. When the appropriate volume of Kang Fu Duo has entered, the motor pump automatically starts and lifts the liquid upward. Once the lifting is complete, the motor pump automatically shuts off. Using this machine not only reduces labor but also reduces the liquid's contact with air, ensuring its cleanliness, as the transport pipes are directly connected to the bottling process. There is also a large vacuum distiller, the principle and use of which are completely the same as the small electric heating vacuum distiller in the preparation room. The difference is that one uses regular heat while the other uses steam heat. This large distiller has a large capacity and produces a large quantity, making it suitable for extracting ordinary cod liver oil. The dual-purpose fire and steam heated distilled water machine is used to produce distilled water for preparing Kang Fu Duo.</p>
<p>Tablet Production Workshop: This factory is dedicated to the production of Kang Fu Duo tablets. Inside, there are double-ball powder mills, mixers, sand granulators, ambient temperature electric heating dryers, tablet making machines, sugar coating machines, polishing machines, and more, arranged in an orderly fashion. Not only are the designs aesthetically pleasing, but the production efficiency of each machine is also substantial. All of these designs are the result of the factory's authorities' ten years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry and countless research and improvements, enabling them to achieve this level of perfection. The success of Kang Fu Duo tablet production is due to the prior invention of extracting super-strength cod liver oil from cod liver oil. This super-strength cod liver oil is used as the main ingredient, combined with the existing ingredients in Kang Fu Duo liquid, such as manganese, iron, calcium, potassium, quinine, and guaiacol, which are mixed with a mixer. Raw materials with coarser textures must first be ground to the desired fineness using a double-ball powder mill before mixing to ensure complete and even blending. Distilled water is then added, and the mixture is granulated with a sand granulator, dried in an ambient temperature electric heating drying cabinet at a temperature not exceeding 60 degrees Celsius, and then formed into tablets by a tablet making machine. Subsequently, the tablets are coated with chocolate sugar in a sugar coating machine and finally polished in a polishing machine, completing the production of the tablets. Upon close inspection, the tablets are not only smooth and uniform but also brightly colored and eye-catching. Chocolate-colored sugar coating is particularly difficult to produce. Without sufficient research and experience, the color will easily become dull, and it will be difficult to achieve uniform coverage. The factory's products have reached a level of perfection, and their spirit of painstaking research is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Packaging Room Walls: Three Kang Fu Duo storage tanks are installed above, receiving the liquid medicine lifted by the automatic conveyor from the mechanized workshop. Each tank has hoses for bottling. The remaining packaging steps, such as installing wooden stoppers, tightening screws, steaming, sealing, applying tin bottle caps, gluing, attaching product inserts, and wrapping the outer layer of printed paper, are then completed. The aforementioned tin bottle caps are custom-made by a German manufacturer, preventing theft, leaks, and counterfeiting, while also appearing neat and beautiful, and making it easier for distributors in various ports to identify the product. This is truly a multi-beneficial approach.</p>
<p>Boiler Room: Two 30-pound steam pressure boilers are placed on the left and right, which can be used as needed, allowing for flexibility in daily work and avoiding unnecessary waste.</p>
<p>Overall, the factory's facilities are as described above. The various machines installed are not only exquisitely crafted but also entirely designed and manufactured by domestic machine factories, which is particularly commendable and valuable. Furthermore, the site utilization is well-arranged, systematic, and orderly, suitable for application, convenient for management, and exceptionally clean. Recently, we learned that in addition to producing Kang Fu Duo liquid and tablets, the factory is also working hard on the invention of several new specialty drugs, which should be available to the public soon.</p>

<h3 id="e90">The Rootless Flower <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Qing</p>
<p>China has been accepting Western culture for seventy or eighty years, so why is China's scientific progress so slow? The reason is that the Chinese people do not have a sufficient understanding of science. They think that moving some machines from the West and copying some old methods is science. Aviation needs to be developed, but there is no need to focus on the most theoretical fluid mechanics. Radio needs to be promoted, but there is no need to bury oneself in the study of electromagnetic waves. The Chinese people only know how to enjoy Western material civilization but do not seek the Western scientific spirit. Therefore, training the navy, building guns and cannons, developing mining, and operating shipping have been going on for decades, but Chinese science remains immature. It must be known that science must be approached from the root. One should understand the natural mysteries of science, fully acquire scientific knowledge, and then apply it to practical aspects in order to promote and develop it and achieve great success. If one only moves things from the East and copies things from the West, enjoying some ready-made things, it is like picking a rootless flower and bringing it to China. It can only be used for decoration and cannot make it flourish. What benefit is this to China's science?</p>
<h3 id="e91">Human Heredity and Marriage <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Qiu</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Plant melons and get melons, plant beans and get beans," which aptly reveals the mystery of biological inheritance. Ever since Mendel used tall and short pea plants in the monastery to obtain the law of inheritance, this research has attracted the attention of the scientific community. Using fruit flies and plants, it was finally determined that the inheritance of all organisms is controlled by hereditary factors. In modern times, eugenics has emerged to improve the human race. So-called strong nations must first start with improving the human race, and future progress will be considerable.</p>
<p>It is now confirmed that hereditary material is entirely carried by sex cells. Someone once joked that the world's human population is about 1.5 billion, of which sperm only accounts for one drop. This drop of hereditary material creates humans with so many characteristics, which is truly a strange thing. Scientifically, the actual process of fertilization in animals was not fully discovered until the second half of the nineteenth century. An important matter in human heredity is the investigation of the Kallikak family. He married an excellent woman and an inferior woman, one after the other, and the countless descendants produced were simply incomparable between the two branches. Second, Galton established the law of ancestral inheritance, which states that the closer the ancestors, the greater the impact on the descendants. Therefore, the investigation of inheritance became very popular. A few years ago, Mr. Pan Guangdan also conducted research on the genealogy of Mei Lanfang, stating that the achievements of famous actors are at least related to inheritance (published in the Tsinghua Journal). Inheritance is indeed one of the two major factors creating life, along with the environment.</p>
<p>Human inheritance can be divided into two aspects according to existing research results, but it is often not completely obvious when encountering special circumstances. In terms of physical constitution, such as edema, diabetes insipidus, color blindness, jaundice, resistance to goiter, shortened lifespan, blood type, hemorrhoids, cryptorchidism, hernia, epilepsy, and diabetes, there is genetic confirmation. However, except for color blindness, which has been clearly proven to have a higher chance of inheritance for women, the inheritance forms of other various conditions have not yet been fully understood. However, the possibility of inheritance has been proven undoubtedly.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of spiritual inheritance, this is similar to Galton's ancestral inheritance theory and is very obvious in terms of intelligence. In terms of so-called innate endowment, the inheritance of conditions such as idiocy and mental deficiency is well known to doctors. Conversely, superior intelligence, such as that of scientists, politicians, and writers, is very common in their inheritance. In Darwin's family, from his grandfather onwards, there were sixteen famous scientists in five generations. Is this a coincidence? The popular saying "Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes" is very reasonable.</p>
<p>There is also research on consanguineous marriage in inheritance. Plant-based studies have shown that due to inbreeding, there are often adverse results in subsequent generations. In China, it has been believed since ancient times that children born from consanguineous marriages are mostly physically weak, mentally deficient, and have declining reproductive capacity. According to a survey of 830 consanguineous marriages by Bemiss in 1859, about 22% of their descendants were healthy, while 76% were unhealthy, which clearly indicates that consanguineous marriage is not appropriate. However, conversely, if the ancestors are all virtuous, good, and healthy, then consanguineous marriage may produce more outstanding individuals. Therefore, the current conclusion on this issue is that if the lineage has excellent traits, consanguineous marriage can maintain its characteristics in future generations. If there are doubts about inheritance between close relatives, marriage should be avoided to prevent the risk of increasing adverse inheritance. In short, it is better to reduce consanguineous marriage.</p>
<p>The choice of marriage is related to oneself and one's descendants, and also has an impact on the country and the nation. The eugenics and eugenic education that is popular all over the world aims to improve both nature and the environment. Seeds rely on innate heredity, while the day after tomorrow depends on the educational environment. In this wave of national rejuvenation, everyone may be in urgent need of this common sense of human inheritance. The superior should be preserved, and the inferior should be eliminated. At least it has a significant relationship with our family, so how can marriage be a matter without scientific conditions?</p>
<h3 id="e92">Spiral Helicopter <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Ren</p>
<p>Currently, airplanes require large airfields to maneuver freely, hover, and take off and land. It is still difficult to fly from private residences. This is an obstacle to the widespread use of airplanes, which urgently needs to be solved by inventors. There are now several types of helicopters that take off and land vertically. The most common one is the rotorcraft with a windmill-shaped blade on top of the fuselage. Recently, an inventor in California, USA, designed a completely different type of helicopter.</p>
<p>The wing of the aircraft spirals like a coil spring, encircling a vertical shaft. The wing is filled with gas, and the shaft stands upright on a spherical fuselage. Rudders and stabilizers are mounted on a yoke, which is mounted on the horizontal axis of the spherical fuselage and can move to control the direction of the aircraft. The aircraft has another feature: if the engine is damaged midway, the bottom containing the engine and fuel tank can be detached and fall freely, while the other parts of the aircraft can slowly descend like a parachute.</p>
<p>Although it is expected that the speed of the aircraft cannot compete with current airplanes, it can take off and land in a very small area, which gives it special uses such as transportation between rural areas and cities, military reconnaissance, map making, and maritime rescue. It is especially convenient for private use. The diagram shows the shape of the spiral helicopter. The wing is spiral, winding around the axis and filled with gas. The bottom containing the engine and fuel tank can be detached.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Observation of Rainfall <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Compiled by</p>
<p>Rainfall or snowfall is a common phenomenon for us, but it has a close relationship with the growth of plants and animals on the ground and the survival of humans. Almost every drop of water on land comes from rain and snow falling from the sky. Without rain and snow, all living things on land would be extinct, and areas with less rain and snow would become deserts, unsuitable for human habitation. In ancient times, nomadic people lived by water and grass, so areas with abundant rainfall were often the birthplace of ethnic groups. When they abandoned nomadism and engaged in farming, timely rain and sunshine were especially beneficial to farmland. As for the rain and snow that fall on the ground, most of them converge into streams, rivers, and lakes and flow into lakes and oceans, and it is difficult to list all the benefits to mankind.</p>
<p>Since rain and snow are so important to mankind, since ancient times, people have believed that rainfall or snowfall is controlled by the creator and have never paid close attention to and researched it. Even in European and American countries, it was not until the last hundred years that people began to advocate it and engage in observation. However, it was soon regarded by the government as one of the important national policies, which was greatly expanded, and huge sums of money were spent every year, which lasted for a long time. The country's scientific kick is immature, and it is inevitable that it lags behind in observing rainfall. However, in the past ten years, it has also been following Europe and the United States, roughly forming a scale. Unfortunately, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the country has been in turmoil, and this matter has not been taken care of.</p>
<p>This article will briefly describe the simple principles of observing rainfall, so as to introduce it to the people of the country. Those who are interested in this matter can engage in it individually, without waiting for the government to promote it before organizing it. Then, after the war is over, they can still maintain a relatively long-term record, which is not a way to contribute to the country.</p>
<p>(1) The observation of rainfall includes all water volume falling on the ground, so snow, sleet, and hail are also included in it, but rainfall accounts for the most part, so it is collectively called it. The instrument for measuring rainfall is called a rain gauge.</p>
<p>(2) There are many types of rain gauges. The one used in our country is shown in the attached figure, which is composed of (1) a rain-collecting funnel, (2) an outer cylinder, and (3) a rain-measuring tube. The diameter of the rain-collecting funnel is eight inches, and the remaining dimensions can be obtained according to the scale in the figure.</p>
<p>(3) Rainfall is measured in millimeters (mm) of water depth falling on the ground, so the collected snow, sleet, and hail should be melted into water first, and then measured. The water depth accumulated in the rain-measuring tube is exactly ten times the rainfall, so find a way to use a wooden strip to measure the number of centimeters of water depth in the tube, which is equivalent to the number of millimeters of rainfall.</p>
<p>(4) The rain gauge must be placed on a flat ground in the room to obtain accurate records. The location should not be placed on the roof or soil that is too high above the ground.</p>
<p>(5) Rainfall should be observed daily at a specified time, preferably at 7 or 8 AM, so that the obtained record can be used as the rainfall for the following day. However, in the event of a heavy rain, it should be measured and recorded in installments, and the start and end times of the rainfall should be recorded.</p>
<p>(6) The data obtained from observing rainfall should be recorded in a table, with the unit of rainfall being one millimeter, and calculated to one decimal place. Any day with rainfall less than 0.1 mm is considered as no rain, which is related to the statistics of rainy days.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Man-Made Crystal <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>Quartz is a very common mineral, its composition the same as sand and gravel.  When naturally produced and purely transparent, it is called crystal. However, some contain impurities, resulting in non-transparent colors. Transparent crystal has a wide range of uses, and large pieces are highly valued. But now it can be mass-produced. This is due to the proper methods being found after ten years of research. Therefore, not only has important industry been helped, but also scientific research and the arts have progressed. Because sand and gravel (silicon dioxide) account for about three-fifths of the Earth's crust for ten miles, there is no need to worry about a shortage of raw materials. The most important things are of course mechanical equipment and capital, etc.</p>
<p>The most important property of crystal is its transparency to light, allowing it to transmit from infrared rays (heat rays) to extremely short ultraviolet rays. Moreover, its expansion after heating is very small, only 0.0000058 per degree Celsius increase, only one-fourteenth of that of glass, one-seventeenth of platinum, and one-thirty-fourth of copper. A one-meter-long crystal rod, when the temperature rises by a thousand degrees, only expands by six ten-thousandths. With such a long rod, light entering from one end can have 93 percent pass through to the other end.  Whether visible or invisible light, it can pass through the curve of crystal without much loss, meaning it is very transparent.</p>
<p>The glass condenser lenses used in cinemas have a very short lifespan because they are subject to high heat and usually crack within one or two days. If made of crystal, they can be used for seven or eight months. The pendulum inside a clock often expands and contracts due to cold and heat, causing the clock to run inaccurately. If the pendulum is made of crystal, there is no fear of expansion and contraction. When a glass thermometer and a crystal thermometer are placed in ice (0 degrees), and then brought out to a heat of five thousand one hundred and fifty degrees, and then placed back in ice, the glass thermometer will show four degrees below zero.  But the crystal one will still maintain 0 degrees. Large lenses and reflectors in observatories are subject to expansion and contraction due to cold and heat. All those made of glass must be maintained at a constant temperature by various methods in order to obtain accurate results. If crystal is used instead, these procedures can be reduced.</p>
<p>When a quarter-inch thick glass tube is heated until it turns red and then immersed in water, it will crack.  A similar crystal tube heated to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit (the melting point of platinum) and then immersed in water to cool down will not crack. This is also because the thermal expansion and contraction are very small.</p>
<p>The ultraviolet rays emitted by a crystal mercury lamp can pass through a crystal rod. Therefore, photographs can be taken of recesses in the human body or other places that are not easily accessible, and direct examinations can be carried out.</p>
<p>The method of manufacturing crystal is to use small grains of natural crystal, placed in a stone or carbon crucible, pressed very tightly, so that when the concentration increases and the product needs to burst, each part does not scatter, allowing gas to enter the gaps to form bubbles.  In a vacuum furnace, the crystal is melted at about 18,000 degrees, the faster the better, within three quarters of an hour, and the lower the pressure, the better. The transformed transparent dross, containing some small bubbles, is placed in another graphite crucible, hung vertically in the middle of a carbon tube furnace. A graphite rod is installed to gather in the crucible to form a piston shape, with heavy pressure added on top. After the furnace ash is burned and melted, the bubbles are crushed by the heavy pressure, and at the same time, the crystal is pressed down, forming rods, tubes, or other shapes. If large crystals are to be made, then a vacuum furnace that can withstand high pressure can be used, the crystal placed inside, and after it is melted by heat, the vacuum valve is closed tightly and the pressure is increased. In this way, extremely large crystal blocks are formed, with no bubbles inside, and are better than the best optical glass.</p>

<p>A certain mental hospital in England has recently opened a strange ranch, not raising cattle and sheep and other livestock, but raising mosquitoes, the purpose of which is to transmit malaria to humans. But readers should not think that this ranch is some kind of killer monster training ground in a future germ warfare, it has great benefits for humans, because according to experiments, several kinds of neurological diseases can be treated with malaria, just use mosquitoes as a medium to make the patient suffer from mild malaria.</p>
<p>The mosquitoes raised in this ranch are native to England. After hatching from eggs, they are fed rabbit blood for several days. Then they are placed in glass bottles, and the mouth of the bottle is placed against the leg of someone suffering from malaria. These mosquitoes suck a small amount of blood from his leg, and then become a medium for transmitting malaria germs.</p>
<p>Then use fifteen or twenty of these mosquitoes, place them in another bottle, and put the mouth of the bottle against the skin of a person suffering from a neurological disease. When they bite the skin, they transmit the germs to the neurological patient, and soon this person develops mild malaria. In most cases, this malaria is very effective in treating neurological diseases. The malaria germs used in this hospital are imported from Madagascar and are a relatively harmless type of germ.</p>

<p>The life-saving belt is a device that uses chemical action to save people from drowning. It is a new invention of the British Lyf-Boy company. The central part of the belt stores a kind of mixed chemical medicine, which can be transformed into gas, causing that part to swell. When in use, the rescuer fastens the belt around the chest of the person in distress and squeezes the center of the belt forcefully to make it expand, thus obtaining a kind of buoyancy, helping the person in distress float to the surface of the water, making it easier for the rescuer to drag him to the shore. The reason for the expansion is that when squeezing, a dilute acid solution splashes onto a small amount of acidic sodium carbonate, resulting in the generation of expanding gas.</p>

<p>Now many people in the world are paying attention to soaring in the air, and at the same time, some people are working hard to travel in the water. The underwater spectacle is no less than the illusion in the air, and traveling in the water is indeed worthy of our attention.  Connett, a Chicagoan in the United States, recently plans to travel from Chicago to Michigan City in a self-made fish-shaped one-person submarine, traveling underwater for a distance of thirty-seven miles. This fish-shaped one-person submarine has an extremely small body, only eleven feet long, twenty-three inches wide in the chest, and only thirty-seven inches high. It can be called the smallest submarine in the world. Connett has taken this submarine underwater 347 times, reaching a depth of 31 feet and a distance of 14 miles. The submarine relies on two sets of batteries for power, and also has all the equipment of a submarine, such as a respirator, air supply, air pump, and periscope.</p>

<p>Vein Patterns on the Back of the Hand</p>
<p>Vein patterns on the back of the hand, like fingerprints, can also be considered a unique sign of each person. This is a new theory advocated by German Dr. Forck. According to him, the vein patterns on the back of each person's hand are crisscrossed, and the patterns formed are different from each other and have their own characteristics. The vein patterns on the back of the hands of twins are indeed very similar, which is an exception, just like the fingerprints of twins.  All other people have absolutely no identical patterns. The doctor used infrared photography to study this issue and came to this conclusion.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Meaning of Death <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Today is the 29th anniversary of the Yellow Flower Mound Seventy-Two Martyrs' sacrifice for righteousness. All the people of the Republic of China, of course, are very much commemorating them. I, in addition to commemorating them, cannot help but reflect on the past and feel the meaning of death.</p>
<p>Jesus said: "Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will save it." Although this sentence originally had a religious meaning, we may as well take it and use it flexibly: the first part can be said to be for those who are generally greedy for life and afraid of death,苟延残喘 (eke out an existence), and the second part can be given to our martyrs, because if it were not for their generous sacrifice, where would we have an independent and autonomous Republic of China to avoid being slaughtered by foreign tribes!</p>
<p>Now, our independence and autonomy are again facing great danger, and Yellow Flower Mound has also been trampled under the iron hooves of the enemy. What should we do today, or from today onwards, to be worthy of our martyrs? How can we ensure that our country will no longer be slaughtered by foreign tribes? Of course, we still need to follow the spirit of our martyrs, make generous sacrifices, and not be afraid of death!</p>
<p>Before the War of Resistance, I always felt that our national spirit was somewhat depressed. When the War of Resistance began, I saw many people with lofty ideals and integrity, for the sake of saving the country, going through fire and water, and not hesitating to die, and I turned to optimism. Now, except for a few people on the isolated islands who are still living in a drunken dream, regardless of rise and fall, everyone else has simply been fully mobilized and is engaged in a great struggle that has never been seen before in ancient times. I can say that everyone has such a change because everyone already knows the meaning of death, that is, everyone already has the spirit of the Seventy-Two Martyrs who are not afraid of death.</p>
<p>Soon after the Seventy-Two Martyrs died, the brand-new Republic of China was established. Now, soon after hundreds of millions of martyrs die, I can also predict that the glorious Republic of China will look down on the world.</p>
<p>Death can be lighter than a feather, or heavier than Mount Tai. To die for the country and the nation is naturally heavier than Mount Tai. If civil officials do not love money and military officers are not afraid of death, the country has hope of being saved. I hope that every citizen, whether civil or military, will make that death heavier than Mount Tai when necessary, so that the victory of the War of Resistance will be realized soon!</p>
<p>It is better to be a lioness who rushes to death than a sheep who is greedy for life. Modern people should have this modern spirit! The martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound are all lions, and only the "pacifist" traitors are sheep. Let us rise up and follow in the footsteps of the martyrs: Die! Die! Die! Seek life from death!</p>

<p>— Ming Zhi</p>
<p>Grandma took out a large bucket of rice, and a group of people squatted on the ground, each taking a bowl and eating. But today's situation was a little different. So Grandma said with a smile:</p>
<p>"You used to be always laughing and talking, eating happily, why are you sighing like this today, as if you have something on your mind?"</p>
<p>"Grandma," said a small team leader, Wang Mingyuan, "we do have something on our mind. But you wouldn't understand if we told you."</p>
<p>This group of them had been living in Grandma's house for half a month, so they were all very familiar with each other and there was nothing to be restrained about. Grandma cooked for them, and they were paid the same wages. Grandma's son still worked in the fields as usual, and his wife and grandchildren also lived at home as usual, helping Grandma cook. Grandma often chatted with them, and they also treated Grandma's family as their own, and did not hide anything.</p>
<p>"Tell me about it," Grandma actually urged, "maybe I can figure it out."</p>
<p>"Well," Wang Mingyuan said it.</p>
<p>It turned out that they had received an order from "above" today, asking them to send some equipment and leaflets to a designated place in the city tomorrow. The day after tomorrow, they would attack the city from four directions. Their people had already entered the city and were waiting for the equipment and leaflets to arrive so they could rise up and respond at that time. But in the past few days, the inspection at the city gate had been very strict. Not to mention that they could not bring anything in, even ordinary men would inevitably be in danger when they walked to the city gate. They were uneasy about this matter, so they were not even motivated to eat.</p>
<p>"What's so difficult about this," Grandma still said with a smile, "I'll take care of it for you."</p>
<p>"This won't do!" Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>"This won't do! This won't do!" The other "brothers" also said this.</p>
<p>Grandma's daughter-in-law heard it by the waist door and also said to Grandma from afar, "This won't do!"</p>
<p>"What's so wrong with it!" Grandma stopped smiling and said resolutely.</p>
<p>"I can carry these things and walk these roads."</p>
<p>"It's not like that," Wang Mingyuan quickly took a few bites, finished his meal, and said, "This matter is very dangerous. We can't ask you, such an old grandma, to do it." "That's a joke," Grandma said coldly, "What's the use of being old? I should be doing such dangerous things! Besides, this is for the country: you are fighting regardless of your lives, what am I, an old woman, hiding for! Isn't Grandma Zhao also an old woman!"</p>
<p>This was really somewhat unexpected for the group of people. Grandma actually understood these things and had this determination. But this was not unexpected after all, because in the past half month, the group of people's words, whether intentional or unintentional, Grandma had heard a lot. Even the story of Grandma Zhao, she had heard it very well.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyuan had nothing to say for a while, so he stood up and looked at Grandma. Seeing that she was an old woman in her fifties with very good spirits, who was usually organized in managing her family and decisive in dealing with things, now standing in front of the group of people, with such a confident look, it really made people believe that she could do this.</p>
<p>"Then what do you want to do?" Wang Mingyuan couldn't help but say this.</p>
<p>"Watch my method tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>"Okay, we'll see your method tomorrow." Wang Mingyuan had no choice but to respond this way.</p>
<p>In the evening, Grandma's son came back and knew about this matter. He was very uneasy and advised his mother not to take such a big risk. He should do it himself. Later, he knew that he really couldn't do it, and Grandma was so determined, so he had no choice but to worry, making it difficult for him to sleep all night!</p>
<p>But Grandma slept very soundly at night. She got up before dawn. She used to get up early to prepare tea and breakfast for the group of people. Today, she got up even earlier, first did the daily routine with her daughter-in-law, gave a few instructions, and then walked into the group of people and said to them:</p>
<p>"Take out all your things, I'm going to prepare them."</p>
<p>After she said that, she returned to her room. When she came out again, everyone couldn't help but be surprised. When they looked closely again, they couldn't help but laugh out loud. It turned out that she had completely disguised herself, disguised as an old beggar woman, with rags on her body and disheveled hair on her head, not to mention that, but she had smeared pot ash on her face, and red candle oil and red dye water on her hands and exposed insteps, which looked really like pus flowing, filthy and unbearable. In addition, she was carrying a bamboo stick and a broken basket in her hands, and the basket contained a broken bowl and some rags.</p>

<p>— Ming Tian</p>
<p>There are indeed many things in the world that make people anxious and embarrassed when they see them, but they are helpless. Seeing "monkeys climbing trees, not stopping until they die," I am afraid it is one of these examples.</p>
<p>The spirit of monkeys is admirable. They refuse to rest, they want to climb. If they walk down well, they still want to climb; if they unfortunately fall down, they still want to climb. If they climb to a side branch, they want to climb; if they climb to the top, they still want to climb. Climb and climb again, climb endlessly, climb until they die. Zhuge Liang's "exerting himself to the utmost, until his death" is nothing more than this spirit.</p>
<p>We praise Zhuge Liang, so we also praise monkeys; we praise monkeys, so we also praise people who are like monkeys now, because according to the general rules of arithmetic, people who are like monkeys now are Zhuge Liang.</p>
<p>The most common are gamblers. If they win money, they want to win more, so they still want to gamble; if they lose money, they want to make a comeback, so they want to gamble even more, until they gamble away everything. If they are lucky, they will become tramps, and if they are unlucky, they will commit suicide. The most common are lustful ghosts. They love one when they see one. Today they dance, and tomorrow they go to a brothel. They must lose all their family property and have sores all over their bodies before they stop. There are many other examples that can be cited everywhere, and they are also heard and seen by everyone, so it is not surprising to talk about them.</p>
<p>They all have the spirit of monkeys, so some people say, "This is why this 'Zhuge Liang' is a 'Zhu'!"</p>
<p>But what is strange is that nowadays, transportation is developed and cultures communicate, and this kind of "Ge Liang" with the spirit of monkeys has actually "Zhu" to foreign countries after one "Zhu". So some "Ge Liang" are simply using the offensive of "Six Expeditions to Qishan" and sending troops again and again: if a large country is annexed, they refuse to stop; if a small port is taken back, they refuse to stop; if they gain benefits in one thing, they want to gain more, and refuse to stop; if they do not get anything in one thing, they must get it, and they refuse to stop even more: they are really going to reach the point of "dying after exerting themselves to the utmost" in Wuzhangyuan!</p>
<p>Moreover, nowadays, civilization is progressing and everything is surpassing the past. This kind of monkey with the "Ge Liang" spirit has actually "Zhu" to countless times after one "Zhu", and can be encountered almost everywhere on a large piece of land in China. They follow the habit of climbing trees. If there is a road, they certainly want to take it; if there is no road, they also want to break through blindly. They pick up bargains and want to pick up more. They suffer losses and want to retaliate, and they want to drill east and drill west even more. They are implementing the principle of "not stopping until they die."</p>
<p>Seeing these phenomena, one can only praise, "Ah, how prosperous!" They do have a firm and unyielding will and will not stop until they achieve the purpose of death.</p>
<p>Fortunately, heaven follows the wishes of the "monkeys". Their efforts are mostly rewarded as they wish. Some who have not yet achieved their goals will sooner or later be unable to climb if they really "do not stop". They will either fall to their death or die from fatigue.</p>
<p>"Grandma Liu" Wu Zhihui once had a sentence, called: "Monkeys playing with X, drawing blood." This spirit can be invented in conjunction with climbing trees. Because we can see many monkeys under the tree who have already "stopped", or monkeys who are "not stopping" but dripping with "blood". They have all become "one hill of badgers". It is a pity that this "hill" is not the "first hill".</p>
<p>Some people still want to persuade them not to climb endlessly like this, but it is completely useless. Because "orangutans can speak, but they do not leave beasts", there is ultimately no reason to talk to humans and beasts, so we can only watch them climb as much as they can, until they can't climb anymore.</p>

<p>Fourteen　Seeing the Light of Day Again</p>
<p>It can be said that Ye Guozhang's army recaptured Hepu Town without any effort, without any resistance at all, and this was true in all directions. This was entirely due to Chen Zhenzhang's clever plan to summon all the puppet troops to attend a carnival meeting and completely remove all the usual defenses. Although there were a few sentries patrolling on the road, most of them did not have time to escape back to report and were shot to death by our army. Ye Tuanzhang's three-way army, mighty and magnificent, rushed to Hepu Town and surrounded the Township Office, which had been turned into a fake "Maintenance Association". Those puppet troops were still kept in the dark, cheering and drinking freely inside the Township Office, enjoying the carnival as much as possible.</p>
<p>It was not until a cannon shot and rifle and machine gun sounds were mixed together, and bullets were flying into the Township Office in a chaotic manner, that they all panicked. This matter was completely unexpected for the puppet troops. They saw their officers suddenly dying with blood flowing from their seven orifices for no reason in the outer hall, and they already knew that things were not good. But they did not expect that Ye Tuanzhang's army would counterattack so quickly. They had originally come to attend a carnival meeting, and most of them did not carry weapons. At this time, they seemed to be turtles in a jar. Apart from cursing "fool" in their mouths, they had no choice but to be captured. A small number of people carrying weapons still delusionally resisted, using the walls on both sides as cover to shoot outwards. But the ammunition they carried was limited after all. When they ran out of ammunition, they had no choice but to raise the white flag.</p>
<p>Ye Tuanzhang ordered a unit to enter the Township Office to disarm the enemy troops and monitor the prisoners, and another unit to go to the town and nearby to search for the remaining enemy troops. He also ordered Zhao Desheng, the brigade commander, to immediately lead his troops to the southeast to establish contact with the first company and second column led by Zhu Canmou, and to deploy defenses tightly there to prevent the enemy troops in Mingxi Town from attacking. After all the deployments were completed, Ye Tuanzhang contemptuously used his command knife to pick off the plaque of the "Hepu Town Local Maintenance Association" in front of the Township Office, raised his foot, and with a "cha" sound, crushed it into pieces, and strode into the Township Office.</p>
<p>Inside the Township Office, there were broken cups and plates everywhere, tables and chairs were overturned, and several corpses were lying on the hall. Among them, Chen Zhenzhang's death was the most tragic. Not only was he poisoned and blood flowed from his seven orifices, but his head was also hit by a bullet from a Japanese officer, his skull was shattered, and his brains were flowing all over the ground. Although he sacrificed himself for righteousness and did not see the restoration of Hepu Town with his own eyes, his mission was undoubtedly fully completed.</p>
<p>Ye Tuanzhang looked at Chen Zhenzhang's tragic death and couldn't help but shed tears sadly. He personally put a blue sky, white sun, and crimson ground flag on his body and said to everyone sadly:</p>
<p>"Do not seek life to harm benevolence, but sacrifice life to achieve benevolence. Chen Zhenzhang has completely done this. His death is glorious, and I hope everyone can learn from his spirit of sacrificing himself for righteousness and taking righteousness over life." (45)</p>

<p>— Xi Meng</p>
<p>Our ancient, closed-off country, due to its internal corruption, could not withstand the cannons of the Opium War in 1842, and its doors were blasted open. The Chinese rural economy, gasping under cruel feudal exploitation, began to be ravaged by the giant hand of capitalism, and the entire national economy gradually moved towards colonization. Poor China, from then on, was like a small boat, floating on the terrifying waves of the ocean. If it did not fight for survival, then the danger of destruction was truly possible at any time.</p>
<p>But survival is a human instinct, and the Chinese people must break away from the fate of colonization in order to survive in the world. Therefore, blood debts must be paid with blood. For the sake of China's independence, freedom, and happiness, countless martyrs shed their blood on the land of their motherland. The sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang was, on the one hand, the result of their advancing fiercely along the bloody path of their predecessors, and on the other hand, it opened up a wider avenue of national revolution for us, the yet-to-die later generations.</p>
<p>Before the Battle of Huanghuagang, our Chinese national revolution successively included the Pingli Uprising, the Chao, Yi, Qin, and Uprising; the Zhennanguan and Hekou Uprisings, and the Guangzhou New Army Uprising. However, the Battle of Huanghuagang determined the basic elements of the victory of the Xinhai Revolution.</p>
<p>The martyrs of Huanghuagang sacrificed themselves, and the Xinhai Revolution eventually succeeded on the surface, but the mission of China's national revolution has not yet been completed. Until today, our great Republic of China has reached the critical moment of life and death: "It is either death or life!" The fate of the Republic of China has been decided on this all-out and long-lasting war of resistance!</p>
<p>The path we are taking today is, in essence, still the path taken by the martyrs of Huanghuagang. However, without a doubt, the path we are taking today is a hundred or a thousand times more difficult than the one taken by the martyrs of Huanghuagang. Today, when we commemorate the heroic sacrifice of the martyrs of Huanghuagang, first of all, we must learn their spirit of sacrificing the "small self" to fulfill the "big self." Therefore, in this arduous and long-lasting war of resistance in China, if we do not go to the battlefield, whether we are the bosses of factories and stores, or the workers and clerks of factories and stores, in short, all the people must be calm and strive to save money, and not cooperate with the enemy.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the period when the martyrs of Huanghuagang sacrificed themselves, the consciousness of national revolution had already spread widely among the minds of the people throughout the country. No matter how cruelly the Qing Dynasty suppressed it, the fate of the Qing Dynasty was ultimately over. And this consciousness of national revolution has not only not disappeared today, but has become even stronger. Based on past precedents, we firmly believe that our final victory in China is certain and without doubt. Therefore, today, when we commemorate the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, we must adhere to the belief that "resistance will surely be victorious and nation-building will surely succeed," and eliminate pessimistic, wavering, and compromising ideas that lead to national subjugation.</p>
<p>The ideals of the martyrs of Huanghuagang must be realized in this great and sacred war of resistance!</p>

<h3 id="e107">Commemoration of the Guangzhou Uprising <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Na Jue</p>
<p>In today's increasingly profound national crisis, coinciding with the 29th anniversary of the martyrdom of the martyrs of the Guangzhou Uprising, our recollection of the spirit of the martyrs who gave their lives to build the country feels even more significant in its meaning.</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock on the night of March 29, twenty-eight years ago, the comrades of the Min Party launched another revolutionary movement in Guangzhou. In advance, Mr. Hu Hanmin secretly set up an organization to preside over everything, and dispatched Huang Keqiang and others to command the attack on the Governor's Office; unexpectedly, the plan was leaked, and the Governor's Office was already on guard, so the matter failed. In this battle, a total of more than one hundred martyrs were killed in action and captured and martyred. It was the most tragic and the last failed of all the revolutions before the Wuchang Uprising.</p>
<p>At that time, Mr. Pan Lengshan collected only seventy-two remains and buried them in the wilderness of the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou; although the loyal bones of the remaining dozens of martyrs were lost, their revolutionary spirit will last forever with the seventy-two martyrs.</p>
<p>In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, Lin Sen, the current Chairman of the National Government, moved the remains of the seventy-two martyrs to Huanghuagang, and investigated their names and origins to honor the great martyrs and repay their great achievements. The analysis of the origins of the seventy-two martyrs is as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 42 Fujian 9</p>
<p>Hunan 5 Guangxi 4</p>
<p>Zhejiang 4 Sichuan 3</p>
<p>Anhui 3 Jiangsu 2</p>
<p>In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the Revolutionary Memorial Association found that Xu Guotai, Hua Jinyuan and other thirteen people also participated in this battle and died on the spot; their origins were</p>
<p>Guangdong 9 Jiangsu 3</p>
<p>Guangxi 1</p>
<p>The revolutionary party members who sacrificed this time accounted for eight provinces, which is worthy of our attention. They only had enthusiasm, regardless of success or failure, the number of people and weapons could not be compared with the Manchu Qing government at that time, but the revolutionary martyrs felt that where righteousness lies, they could only follow one another, and continue to work hard, using the blood they shed to cultivate the seeds of the Republic of China. Therefore, the Guangzhou Uprising can be said to be the prelude to the success of the Wuchang Revolution. We must admire and emulate the spirit of the martyrs who calmly went to justice and were loyal and unyielding!</p>
<p>Today, when compatriots across the country commemorate the Guangzhou Uprising, I believe that everyone will have a deep feeling, and will be determined to inherit the spirit of the martyrs to complete the mission of winning the war of resistance and building the country.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Young Swallows and Orioles Show Off Their Twin Talents, Yue Luo and Wu Jin Weave Seven Splendid Patterns</p>
<p>Let's talk about Zhu Airen leading the two Miss He's to visit the nursery. First, they looked at the Youya Garden, and found the children to be innocent and lovely. Ms. Tong Haiying also taught them to sing, and the little girls had a kind of shy appearance. Although they sang a few children's songs, the childish voices were cute and pleasant to listen to. They also performed a game before it was time for tea. When it was time for tea, all the children sat quietly on small chairs. In front of each person was a small plate, with two cookies on the small plate. There was also a small cup, with a shallow cup of black tea in the small cup. These were all prepared by the nannies in each group, and the older kindergarten students in each group held a milk jug and poured some milk into each cup of black tea. There were also older male kindergarten students in each group, holding a sugar bowl and adding a cube of sugar to each cup of black tea. Why did they have to do it themselves? This was also a way to get used to working. Even so, the nannies were all standing by, paying attention, especially afraid that they would spill the tea cups or break the plates. After the tea, they were dismissed from school, the younger ones walking in front, and the older ones following behind, and they filed out. Zhu Airen and Tong Haiying led them to see a group of babies who were not yet able to go to kindergarten, which was the largest group in the nursery. They were also assigned to the nannies in the nursery, each nanny taking care of several children. These nannies, some were married, some were unmarried. They treated the babies they cared for as if they were their own children. And those babies treated the nannies who cared for them as if they were their own mothers. Women have a maternal instinct. I remember that among the nannies, there was a Ms. Wang, who was a widow and had no children of her own. She came to the nursery to work as a nanny, and Doctor Lao Zhang assigned her three girls and two boys to take care of. She spent all day with these little angels, putting all her troubles behind her. But these were children fostered here by others, and when it came down to it, they were still other people's children, not Ms. Wang's children, nor the nursery's children. One of the five children she cared for was a girl, who was five years old this year. Her parents had to go somewhere else for something, so they wanted to take her out of the nursery. But when Ms. Wang heard the news, she couldn't even eat her meal, and just wept. Doctor Lao Zhang comforted her, saying: "You are crazy! The parents are still there, the child is theirs, why should we be reluctant to let her go?" (73)</p>
<h3 id="e109">Huanghuagang (Drum Ballad) <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Bai</p>
<p>Since the Guangzhou city change, people are uneasy. Governor Zhang also knows that the situation is unusual. He is fearful and suspicious, and sends out secret agents to inquire in detail. At this time, the revolutionary party members are prepared, distributing guns and bullets and agreeing on the time. It was originally agreed to launch the uprising simultaneously on the first day of April, and the headquarters had already been set up in Guanyin Mountain. I don't know which side leaked the news, and several agencies were seized in a few days. In the blink of an eye, it was the twenty-sixth day, and the officials' inspection was even more strict and the precautions were even more busy. The leaders saw that the situation was not right, and suddenly held a meeting to discuss the plan. The time was advanced, but they were afraid that the timing would not be hot and the wish would be difficult to fulfill. They wanted to wait quietly for the first day, but the party members had already revealed their whereabouts. After a meeting with no results, the atmosphere of the search was even more tense on the twenty-eighth day. In a mansion within the Eight Banners, several boxes of violent explosives were seized. The leaders gathered again that night to discuss, and someone suggested quickly closing the shop, "The gathered party members should be disbanded immediately, otherwise, wouldn't it be a waste of effort." Everyone hesitated to speak, and one person stood up in the seat and raised his hand quickly. Said: "Today's situation is like riding a tiger, if you don't want to do it, I will go alone. It is easy to make a mountain nine feet high, but it falls short, and this time the previous efforts are ruined and more effort will be spent later. If you can't bear to sacrifice, you can't accomplish great things, and now how can you allow you to hesitate. The more you can't do it, the more you have to do it, which shows the spirit of revolution and the patriotism. Give it to me! Those who don't want to go, disband first, and the ambitious men will follow me to the battlefield"! The proposer was silent, and then it was decided that the revolution would be initiated on the twenty-ninth day.</p>
<p>Do you know who the person who stood up to speak was? That is the leader, the hero Huang Keqiang. His original name was Huang Xing, Keqiang was his courtesy name, he was from Hunan and studied abroad. He was tall and burly, with a full face, and his mind was meticulous and his nature was rigid. He founded a Xinghua Society in his early years, determined to overthrow the Manchu Qing. The uprising failed and he fled overseas, and the Tongmenghui expanded its organization and met Sun Yat-sen. This time he was ordered to return to China to preside over the major events, and he had already decided to do it in a grand and earth-shattering way. As the saying goes, knowing that there are tigers in the mountains, he still wants to go to the mountains, and he doesn't take failure to heart. The meeting ended and he quickly arranged, and the party members rubbed their fists and prepared to try their swords. At dusk, a large pot of dried shrimp rice was cooked, and everyone had a full meal before departure. Only the sound of cannons was heard on Guanyin Mountain, and the troops divided into five routes, filled with murderous intent. The first route attacked the Governor's Office, the second route occupied the Feilai Temple, the third route blocked the officers and soldiers and ambushed in the south of the city. The fourth route advanced along Xiaofeng Bridge to force the Banner Boundary, and the fifth route monitored the Governor's Training Institute and protected Guanyin Mountain. Who knew that the Governor's Office was prepared in advance, and issued an emergency order to strictly defend the whole area. The first route had just reached Shuangmen Bottom, and the patrol police team stopped them and opened fire. In a mixed battle, the officers and soldiers were defeated, and Jia Yuyong attacked the Governor's Office in one go. The guards inside received the news and braced themselves to resist. Only the rumbling, rumbling, bombs landed and rang in succession, and in an instant the beams collapsed and the practice broke, and fire was everywhere. Huang Keqiang led the team straight in, and Governor Zhang hurriedly took the seal and crossed the back wall. Again, the sound of the horns was loud and the killing was shouted in unison, and the guards panicked and abandoned their weapons and fled. Seeing that the Governor's Office was captured, suddenly the Admiral of the Navy led troops to increase the defense. The party members were trapped in the Gaehe and could not use their strength, and first the trumpeter Lin Wenzhong was shot. Huang Keqiang threw the bomb again, and inadvertently his right hand was injured by three fingers. There was no way to break out of the encirclement and flee, and the other four routes therefore lost their positions at the same time. Guanyin Mountain put down the red light to order the retreat of the troops, and the officers and soldiers took advantage of the situation to chase like tigers and wolves. Some of the party members failed to retreat in time and were captured, and some of the party members fought to the death in the battle. Only the blood flowed into rivers and the corpses lay everywhere, only the sky was sad and the earth was miserable and the stars and moon were without light. Huang Keqiang knew that things were not good and ran away quickly, disguising himself and leaving the South Gate. After the officers and soldiers searched for the revolutionary party, most of the party members who had not left committed suicide, and those who were captured were interrogated, one by one, they were excited and impassioned, regardless of the iron chains, some laughed, some cursed, no one showed fear, which made the interrogating officials ashamed. There was a young man in a suit with a handsome appearance, but his words were very straightforward and fierce. He said: "You only know how to respectfully follow the orders and be slaves, have you ever detailed the world situation? Whose China is China now? You are willing to be a lackey and hurt your brothers and sisters. Stupid things! What are you sitting on to ask me? You won't die this time, Zhang Mingqi! Your life won't be long either. Do you know what is called revolution? We are saving the danger for the survival of the nation. It is better to die for freedom than to live as a slave. Look at the smile on your face, you know your blood is cold". Before the scolding was over, one person hurriedly interjected, saying: "Comrade Lin, you are too warm-hearted. Why talk theory with this kind of dog slave, dogs! We are all revolutionary parties, and we don't need to investigate." The interrogating official said with shame when he heard the words: "Isn't this kind of action of yours absurd, what kind of rebellion are you making without any plan, and aren't you ashamed to be captured today"? With a clang, the iron chain shook and someone shouted: "Nonsense! Do you think we failed? Haha, watch out! Maybe tomorrow you will have to pay for your life." After asking again and again, there was no clue, and one by one they calmly went to justice and returned to heaven. Seventy-two martyrs were martyred, and their remains were buried in Huanghuagang after they became benevolent. The Republic of China was founded on this one move, and the martyrs, from then on, their names will be recorded in the annals of history and will be famous forever. This is a historical fact of March 29th, and later there was the Wuchang Uprising to return my rivers and mountains. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e110">War of Resistance and Entertainment <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Tao</p>
<p>This war of resistance is the most difficult life-and-death struggle, and we should strengthen our combat and strength in all aspects; especially in the second phase of the war of resistance, which is a period of full-scale combat and more difficult times, so we should mobilize in all aspects to strive for the final victory and national liberation!</p>
<p>Therefore, the practitioners in the entertainment circle should also participate in the torrent of the war of resistance and shoulder the active mission of resisting the enemy. Although we are on the isolated island surrounded by demons, we cannot forget that we are still descendants of the Yellow Emperor with blood, and we cannot forget that our motherland is growing up in the midst of a bitter struggle. We should stand under the big banner of resisting the enemy, unite closely, and shoulder the sacred responsibility of the war of resistance for the sake of the country and for ourselves.</p>
<p>Moreover, entertainment is an excellent tool for educating the masses, and we should make good use of it to exert its great educational power. As everyone knows, simply taking sexually suggestive and low-level tastes can no longer attract the general audience and listeners. On the contrary, we can point out that in a certain comedy class in the entertainment arena, singing a "Refugee Hardship," when singing about the enemy's madness and cruelty, and the pain of refugees being displaced, immediately won a fierce applause from the audience and won the audience's enthusiastic love.</p>
<p>It can be seen that in any entertainment sector, as long as we instill the awareness of resisting the war and building the country, it will definitely be accepted by the audience immediately. At the same time, it also shows the determination of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people fully hold an optimistic and firm belief in the future of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Dear gentlemen in the entertainment industry! Strive! For the motherland, for the Chinese nation, and for ourselves, we should use various methods to permeate the audience's hearts with the awareness of resisting the enemy! Entertainment that instills the awareness of resisting the enemy in the lyrics is the new entertainment, the progressive entertainment, and it is also what the public needs! Because the new and progressive entertainment is growing together with the revived China!</p>
<h3 id="e111">Three Great Masters of Jing Role: Hao, Hou, and Jin <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Hermitage Master</p>
<p>In recent years, the talents of the Jing role have become increasingly rare. Qiu Guixian has passed away, Dong Junfeng is down and out, and there is no successor in the copper hammer school. Qiu Zisheng is in the military, and there is more hope, but recently he is still too thin in energy and lacks courage; Wang Quankui has good materials, but unfortunately there is no famous teacher to correct him, and he is crudely made, which is not enough to enter the hall of elegance: The only ones who rely on to support the Jing role situation and whose reputation is becoming increasingly prosperous, looking around the north and south, are only Jin Shaoshan, Hao Shouchun, and Hou Xirui.</p>
<p>Jin is the son of the famous Jing, Jin Xiushan. He first studied the second Jing, and was not valued by people. Since he partnered with Mei Wan Hua to play Farewell My Concubine, his momentum has been greatly boosted. In recent years, he has devoted himself to the plays of the positive Jing, which are magnificent and wonderful. Last year, he went north and formed his own big class, and hung the head brand as the Jing role. His momentum is unprecedented for the Jing role. Last autumn, he took Wu Suqiu to travel in the three northeastern provinces for two months, earning more than 10,000 yuan. He did not return with praise until the beginning of winter. He gained both fame and fortune. Shaoshan is truly a lucky child! Jin's plays are best in terms of frame, such as Lianhuan Tao, Famen Temple, and the three plays of Trial of Li Qi, which are his masterpieces. The kung fu of the positive Jing plays is not weak either, such as the Imperial Fruit Garden, the Grass Bridge Pass, the Dragon Robe, the Ascension to Heaven, and the Breaking of the Secret Gap. Most of the plays are learned from the record player. The pronunciation and singing are based on his ancestors. Xiushan had many records left during his lifetime, and Shaoshan's tune is almost completely obtained from the records.</p>
<p>Hao Shouchun, named Rui, is from Jingzhao and is the direct disciple of the famous Jing Li Lianzhong. His stage name was Xiao Kuilu when he was a child, and he partnered with Datou (Gui Fen) to play the play "Taking the Marshal's Seal," which was highly praised by the audience. His name rose from this. Later, due to a broken voice, he changed from Zheng Jing to Fu Jing. Because he admired Huang San's plays, he devoted himself to Huang San as a method. He is most famous for performing Cao Cao's plays, so he has the reputation of "Living Cao Cao" for a time. He is able to perform many plays, such as除三害, 忠孝全, 下河東, 賽太歲, 白綾計, 飛虎夢, 法鬥寺, 黃一刀, 連環套, 陽平關, which are especially called masterpieces. He partnered with Yang Xiaolou in the two plays of 野猪林 大名府, which were a perfect combination and enjoyed even more fame. Now he is retired and living at home, no longer showing his unique skills to others.</p>
<p>Hou Xirui, Xirui is a graduate of the first class of the Chang Liancheng Science Society. After leaving the class, he also followed Li Lianzhong to study Fu Jing. His martial arts skills are far above Jin and Hao. Although his voice does not meet the requirements of the Jing role, he is good at using it. Therefore, when he dresses up and appears on stage, he has his own domineering aura. His singing and lines are all based on Huang San, and he is on par with Hao Shouchun, without distinction. 丁甲山, 盜御馬, 鬧江州, 戰宛城, 霸王莊 are his immortal works. Occasionally, he partners with Wan Hua to play An Lushan in The Legend of the True Princess, and with Yu Shuang to play Qiu Ran Gong in The Three Heroes of the Wind and Dust, and with Qi Xia to play Deng Jiugong in The Thirteenth Sister, all of which have unique features. Unfortunately, there has been no opportunity to meet for a long time.</p>

<p>Chen Yunshang Returns to Hong Kong to Extend Her Stay</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang "returned to her hometown in glory" to make movies in Hong Kong. It was originally scheduled to set off on the 28th, but the filming of "Fairy Yunshang" was not completed in time, and the schedule was postponed, and it was rescheduled to take a boat south on the 5th of next month. After completing the five film contracts previously ordered by the three companies "Qiming," "Nanxing," and "Minzu," she will return to Shanghai to shoot films for Huacheng Company. To avoid affecting the business relationship of Shanghai films, the filming will be limited to Cantonese and no Mandarin films will be made.</p>
<p>Yuan Shaomei Continues Dancing for Two Months</p>
<p>Yuan Shaomei was hired by the Star Company and is about to take off her dancing clothes and start a new career in the silver screen. The contract stipulates that it will be valid for one full year from June. Because she had just signed a three-month contract with the Ballroom of White Happiness in advance. After consultation, it was not allowed to give up. For this reason, she was bound and had to continue to dance until the end of May when the contract expired before she could change the environment and start filming.</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoqiu Promoted to Director</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoqiu was previously deemed unsuitable for playing young male roles due to his increasing obesity. After starring in the two films "Sister Flowers" and "Rebirth Flowers," he changed his course early, gave up acting, and concentrated on practicing techniques. In recent years, under the guidance of Director Zhang Shichuan, he has served as assistant director for a long time, giving him on-the-spot practical experience. Xiaoqiu has a family tradition and is also rich in artistic talent. Recently, Director Zhang felt that his experience and academic knowledge were very rich, so he made him stand alone and promoted him to director. The filming of his debut work, "Night Pearl," has been going on for many days, and Xiaoqiu is commanding with ease and ease; the results will be very impressive when it is filmed and released in the future. The leading actors in this film are Peng Jianong and Yan Yuexian.</p>
<p>Wu Cun Will Film Yu Tang Chun</p>
<p>After Director Wu Cun was rich in "Meng Jiangnv," he devoted himself to writing the new script "Yu Tang Chun." The story of this film is based on the old play "The Complete Yu Tang Chun" and adapted with some new ideas. The heroine is scheduled to be played by Gong Qiuxia, and the title of the play may be changed to "The History of Su San." Now, after the complete draft is finished, he will start filming.</p>
<p>Zhang Cuihong Plays Wang Bin Chuan</p>
<p>The production of the costume film "Wang Baochuan" by Yihua Film Company is a plan that has been confirmed long ago. Regarding the position of director, Wu Cun has recently been hired. Director Wu is currently the only basic member of "Star." This time, "recruiting talents from Chu for Jin," being hired by Yihua, only to shoot one film, is almost a cameo. According to Director Wu: "The male lead of "Wang Baochuan" is Wang Yuanlong, and the female lead has been sought for a long time, and it has been decided that Zhang Cuihong will play the role." Cuihong used to be a famous singer in Qinhuai, and she has been cultivated in Pingju art for a long time. She has also made several films before, which are still worth watching. It is also an appropriate character for Yihua to appoint as the protagonist of this film.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>In the old feudal era, people who adhered to the old etiquette emphasized titles and origins. Even treacherous figures like Cao Cao and Sima Shi could carry out palace coups, but they left the act of usurpation to their sons. One even taught his descendants to put on a show of abdication, blinding the common people. This shows how important the ancients considered "rectifying names and defining roles." Although Zhuge Liang is portrayed as a person with Taoist skills in dramas, in reality, his character and learning were at least virtuous if not saintly. When we read his "Chu Shi Biao" (Memorial on Dispatching the Army), we cannot help but feel admiration upon reading the lines "I will exhaust myself in the performance of my duty until death!" At the same time, we also feel that Liu Chan, the little rascal, did not value his father's legacy. When Mr. Zhuge was launching his six expeditions to Qishan and nine campaigns to the Central Plains, if he had not repeatedly caused trouble in the rear and listened to slander for no reason, recalling his Shangfu from the front lines, he might have already destroyed Wei and Wu and unified the Central Plains. When Kongming first assisted the late lord, he endured a lot of resentment from Zhang Fei. If he had not been tolerant, he would have long returned to his Wolonggang. During Zhang Fei's intrusion into the tent in the play "Yellow Crane Tower," he grabbed Zhuge Liang and repeatedly demanded the return of his elder brother. That kind of barbaric and unreasonable behavior was truly infuriating. Later, when Xuande returned safely without losing a single hair, Zhang Fei gradually changed his rough and barbaric nature. Speaking of Guan Erye, he was from the west and even more stubborn. His obstinate nature was unyielding. In his eyes, he only respected his elder brother and looked down on everyone else. If Zhuge Liang, who initially assisted Xuande, had not displayed some divine powers and used some means to subdue Guan and Zhang, then all future military orders would have been ineffective. They were sworn brothers with the late lord, sharing life and death. He could not beat them or kill them. They would often lose their tempers in front of the three armies and the generals, calling him an old Taoist priest and questioning how this electrician could command the troops. Therefore, before subduing the rash Zhang Laosan, Kongming had to first subdue the arrogant Lao Er so that he could act boldly. Afterwards, issuing orders would not be met with contempt from Guan and Zhang, thus avoiding delays in military operations. Guan Yu had received kindness from Cao Cao. When the two met, they would inevitably reminisce about old feelings. As the saying goes, "Force can subdue the strong." Mengde was a cunning hero, and Yunchang was a tough man. When Cao Cao was in a desperate situation, showing a little weakness to his old friend (xiǎ xiǎo meaning begging for mercy), Guan Gong would be reminded of old feelings, and his heart would involuntarily let Cao Cao go.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Finance: Both Cash Supply and Demand are Sluggish <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Only Over Two Hundred Taels Traded All Day</p>
<p>Yesterday's cash speculation market conditions were dull due to the indifference of brokers, with almost no interest. Therefore, trading was extremely light, and prices were slightly weak and stable, hovering around 2,080 yuan. Although a certain gold shop continued to buy, Silver Banks and another gold shop successively sold, causing the price to fall by another two yuan. The transaction volume was 200 taels in the morning and 70 taels in the afternoon. Gold jewelry in silver shops remained firm, while customs gold and Sino-British pure gold rose slightly.</p>
<p>Speculative Red Drops Only Two Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, each bar of ten taels initially had little trading volume due to scarce supply and demand. It was not until after 10:00 that a certain gold shop advanced fifty taels from the Silver Bank, with an opening price of 2,081 yuan, slightly different from the closing price of the previous day. After opening, a certain gold shop advanced another fifty taels from the same industry at the same price, followed by another fifty taels from the same industry at a price of 80 yuan. Thereafter, supply and demand turned sluggish again, and the price also stagnated. It was not until around 11:00 that the Silver Bank mutually traded fifty taels at a price of 79 yuan. Until noon, there was no trading, so the noon closing price remained at 79 yuan. In the afternoon, the lack of supply and demand became more pronounced, so the situation was quite stable. Initially, the gold shop sold fifty taels to the Silver Bank at a price of 79 yuan. Later, until 4:00, the gold shop sold another twenty taels to a money exchange business at a price of 2,079 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it dropped by two yuan compared to the previous day's noon closing price. (The difference throughout the day was only two yuan.) The selling price of cash gold from this shop was 2,090 yuan, and the buying price was 2,075 yuan. The current spot gold price was about 500,000 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with no trading.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Remains Firm at the Original Price</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops has not changed because the speculative red has remained stable. Da Tong Hang still lists 211 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang lists 209 yuan, with a buying price of 203 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Suddenly Increases by Half a Penny</p>
<p>A London cable on the 27th reported that British pure gold suddenly increased by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Bank of China's cash purchase price also rose to 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold also increased by 2%, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The high price of the Shanghai standard sample also rose by 3 jiao, totaling 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Demand for Japanese Currency is Uniquely Strong <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.0625. Foreign exchange, oil companies, and foreign firms in this port had substantial settlements. Foreign banks and Hong Kong Telecom provided ample supply, and supply and demand were equal. The market price was extremely stable. Retail investors of speculative red slightly absorbed, and gold shops and money exchange businesses supplied ample supply. The market price changed very little, and the trend was hovering and weak. Because the exchange rate was stable, the transaction volume of foreign currency was sparse, the market price was hovering, with slight fluctuations. Only the demand for Japanese gold notes was very strong. The guild's transactions were not open. Yesterday's market price: the British gold pound decreased by 1 jiao, the British gold note increased by 1 fen, the American surplus note decreased by 1 li, the Dutch note increased by 5 fen, the Italian note decreased by half a fen, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Although Month-End Settlements are Busy, Foreign Exchange is Not Affected <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday was busy due to the approaching month-end, with frequent settlements by oil companies, foreign firms, Asiatic Petroleum, and major foreign firms. However, Hong Kong continued to dump, and foreign firms such as HSBC were still willing to supply, so the potential trend was quite stable, and there were few changes in the middle. Trading was brisk in the morning and extremely light in the afternoon. The Hong Kong exchange rate remained unchanged because supply and demand corresponded.</p>
<p>Initially, the London large bars narrowed by 0.0625 for both near and far terms, New York silver prices remained flat, London raw gold increased by half a penny, the exchange rate of British against American increased by 7 hao, against French increased by a small 3 centimes, against Shanghai increased by 3.75 (quoted but no market), American against British increased by 0.0625, against French increased by 0.0625, against Shanghai unchanged. The central listed exchange rates remained as before. The bank's morning opening selling price of British exchange was 8 pence and 25, and the American exchange was 16 yuan and 0.09375, which were the same as the previous closing prices. After opening, oil companies and Asiatic Petroleum first settled with HSBC at 8 pence and 25 for British exchange, and the situation was quite stable. When HSBC's listed prices were revealed to be unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was revealed to be a little over half a point, calculated as 4.50%, Hong Kong suddenly offered the Dutch exchange to Holland at 16 yuan and 125 for American exchange, so the trend was even more stable. Then, a foreign firm settled with a certain bank at 16 yuan and 0.09375 for American exchange. Later, the foreign firm absorbed 55 yuan and 375 for the Dutch Anta Hong Kong exchange, and the situation remained unchanged. Until the noon closing, the bank's selling price was the same as the morning opening.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign firms' settlements turned sparse, and Hong Kong Telecom also stopped dumping, so the situation was quite quiet, and the price was stable. It was only heard that a foreign firm settled with HSBC at 8 pence and 25 for British exchange (today's term). There was no trading in the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange rates. Until the evening closing, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 25 for British exchange and 16 yuan and 0.09375 for American exchange. As a result, both the British and American exchange rates did not rise or fall, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also did not rise or fall. The day's trading records are listed below.</p>

<p>British-German and British-French Bonds Jump Five Pounds, Other Debts Rise One or Two Pounds, Only Domestic Debt is Constrained by the Environment and Cannot Rise</p>
<p>The London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds market prices on the 27th of this month (Monday) were stimulated by the remarks made by Finance Minister Kong, rising by one to five pounds. Only the British-German continued loan and British-French bonds decreased slightly by half a pound, with a price of 74 and a half pounds. Salt tax guaranteed bonds, because this period's interest is guaranteed, the British-French loan and British-French bonds jumped by five pounds, with a price of sixty pounds. The Hukwang Railway Bonds issued in German with stamps also jumped by two and a half pounds, with a price of twenty and a half pounds. The Crisp Bonds and the Customs Guaranteed Rehabilitation Bonds issued in British currency each rose by two pounds, with prices of thirty pounds and fifty-one and a half pounds, respectively.

The HSBC shares continued to rise by one pound, with a price of eighty-five pounds. The Kaiping Coal Mine shares continued to rise by nine pence, with a price of eighteen shillings. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>Yesterday's security gray market conditions were relieved due to the Ministry of Finance's statement on continuing to maintain creditworthiness. At the same time, people felt softened by the sudden emergency in Nanchang. Looking at the situation on the table, the long positions of large investors insisted on not releasing, and the chips were very dry. Considering the environmental instability, many small and retail investors released a lot, causing the market to be unable to rise. Therefore, the market situation was uncertain, fluctuating within one or two jiao. In this situation, even small fluctuations were limited. Yesterday's events: The Class C stocks revolved around 51 yuan in the morning, and the Class E stocks revolved around 50 yuan, which was generally slightly firmer than the day before. However, the Class A stocks were slightly weak. Runli, Lemao, Lianhe, and Hengfu bought, while No. 5, No. 38, Songmao, and Tongkang sold. Qiafeng sold Class A and bought Class E, so the price was fiercely supported and evenly matched. In the afternoon, Qiafeng and Runli absorbed, while Tiansheng and Tongkang sold, still evenly matched, revolving around the key points. Because there was a one-day holiday today, people were even more afraid to take action, and the market price results were uneven. The Class C and E stocks had no ups and downs at all, and the others differed by only 5 fen or 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 5740 5720 5735 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Unified B 5140 5090 5135 Up 0.10</p>

<p>Market Rises Gradually</p>
<p>Due to restrictions on the source of walnuts by a certain party, the curtain is tightening day by day, and market prices are mostly shouting high. For example, Matou walnuts, which were previously sold for 26 or 27 yuan, now require 30 yuan. Hand-picked walnuts are shouting to rise by 4 or 5 yuan, and all others are following suit. There is still a possibility of continued tightening in the future.</p>

<p>Fifty Bundles of Chi Li Silk</p>
<p>The overseas silk market had very slight fluctuations. The New York silk prices remained unchanged. The exchange's opening price rose by half a point for the near term and fell by half a point for the far term. The Yokohama raw silk price slightly fell by 5 yuan for spot goods and remained stable for the far term. The Lyons prices rose by 1 franc each. The Shanghai factory's exports have gradually developed, because the actual sales have been sluggish for a long time. Some factories are eager to sell, and speculators are also hoping to emerge. Therefore, yesterday, the French factory issued 2,022 bundles back at 1,650 yuan, so a transaction was possible. Robin Hood's spleen was uneven and returned, selling for 1,700 yuan, which was purchased by a certain bank. The transaction was 50 bundles. The upper body Chi Li silk's sales to the United States are gradually becoming active. The sixth-grade top brand was traded yesterday for 50 bundles, with a price of 1,000 yuan. Observing the market situation, if the customer does not raise the price too high, then the development of silk sales is promising.</p>
<p>Today, eighty-one pieces of Hu silk will be shipped to Europe.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Changes Three Times a Day <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Although Market Prices Fell, Actual Sales Were Still Sluggish, Accounting for Only One-Fifth of the Transaction Volume</p>
<p>The yarn market is still in a flat and weak state and fluctuates greatly, rising and falling erratically, making it difficult to grasp. In fact, since the continuous decline in recent days, the extent of the decline has been deep. The market situation is slightly stable, and those who pick up the wind are coming to drag in, immediately rising. Because customer sales are still as sluggish as before, and the price has risen back, causing speculators to come out again, it enters a weak path in an instant. In short, the environment is poor, making people uncertain. Judging from the market trend, because it has fallen by more than 20 yuan in these five days, there may be a major spin for a while. What will happen in the future? We still have to wait for the actual needs to be healthy before the market price can make a direction. The sellers were scarcer in the afternoon, but the customer needs were still weak.</p>
<p>As for the current yarn situation, rumors were flying at the market's opening this morning, and most people did not see it well, or there was still room to fall, so the opening price fell by 2 yuan. The unit price of 20-count Double Horse stack was 363 yuan and a half. After a short while, a certain yarn shop was determined and came to pull up, absorbing a huge amount and releasing prices to buy in, so the market price gradually rose, and the market suddenly appeared disordered. The prices in the market varied. In a short while, the unit price of 20-count Double Horse stack rose to 368 yuan, and the spot yarn was priced at 369 yuan, which was 4 and a half yuan higher than the opening price. However, after the price rose, many short sellers took the opportunity to close out, and it weakened again, falling back by 2 yuan. The spot Double Horse price was 367 yuan. The brokers poured into the market in the afternoon, but transactions were still rare, and the market price moved between 1 yuan without major changes. According to the statistics of transactions of various gangs throughout the day, there were 1,430 packages. The price of 20-count Double Horse Heavenly Girl was 5 jiao higher than the previous day. The Tianjin gang's demand for 10-count coarse yarn was still strong, and the market was relatively flat. The factory side did not take any action. Yesterday, 50 pieces of yarn arrived from Hong Kong, and today, 10 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 250 pieces were shipped to Shantou, and 25 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Peers: 1,135 Tianjin: 245 Hong Kong: 5</p>
<p>Xiamen: 25 Sichuan: 10 Wenzhou: 5</p>
<p>Mainland: 1 Total: 1,430</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market remained firm and expensive, and it ran counter to the Chinese yarn market, continuing to rise. However, the demand was not strong, and most people were optimistic, so the bulls were pulling tight and not loosening. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn was 341-2 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 331-2 yuan, about 1.2 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e128">It's Difficult for US Cotton Export Subsidies to be Realized, Japanese Factories Compete to Buy Brazilian Cotton <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Cotton Prices Fall One After Another</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market price and the New York cotton market both feel quiet, likely because all companies are waiting for developments in Washington. However, the news from Washington is contradictory and difficult to grasp. Yesterday, there were widespread rumors that the proposal for cotton export subsidies may not be realized, but that the release of loan cotton could be implemented within days. This claim is currently difficult to verify. Yesterday, the New York cotton market rose two to three points due to good news from Liverpool. Indian futures were also predicted to rise two rupees, and Egyptian futures rose more than twenty points. Exchange rates were relatively stable yesterday, and cotton prices converted to legal tender all increased, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rising thirty cents, Indian cotton rising more than fifty cents, and Egyptian cotton rising one yuan.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, due to the war situation, the yarn price has not improved, so cotton mills are very lukewarm about purchasing raw cotton. Only Xinyu received 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, White Broach. Japanese factories were active yesterday, and they handled thousands of bales of foreign cotton again yesterday. Among them, Gongda imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton, Shanghai imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton, Rihua imported 500 bales of American cotton, and Donghua and other companies each imported 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton. The prices of foreign cotton yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Raw Material Category Price delivered to factory, including tax</p>
<p>60 count Egyptian cotton, superior grade 107.90</p>
<p>Also Also Medium grade 105.00</p>

<p>32 count American M. T. 86.00</p>
<p>31 count 42 count American Pengapu 90.45</p>
<p>The native cotton business has suddenly become cold, and the market price is also trending downwards. This is because yarn sales are sluggish and prices have plummeted, making it difficult for factories to operate and reducing profits. Therefore, there is no need for raw materials at all, and all purchases have stopped. As a result, the price of Tonghua cotton suddenly fell by 1.5 yuan, and the price of Huo Ji cotton also fell by more than 50 cents. The source of Su Bei is smooth, and 1,003 bales of Tongzhou fine lint cotton arrived at the dock, as well as 570 pieces of Qidong cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Changshu Mozi 74.50 Wang Fulong Import 210 bales Cash on delivery at warehouse</p>
<p>Huo Ji Cotton 71.20 Imported by fellow traders 200 bales Also Also</p>

<h3 id="e129">Grains: Northern Merchants Make Large Purchases, Flour Mills Gradually Stabilize <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Flour Also Rises by Five Cents, Local Wheat Priced at Seven Yuan</p>
<p>Factory Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market gradually became active. Since local flour and foreign flour began competing for sales, the factory has been giving the Northern merchants promotions, resulting in two rounds of special price competition, which has inevitably attracted the attention of customers. According to news from Tianjin, the local market price can be sold for 5.23 yuan, which is quite profitable. Therefore, the Northern merchants have recently made large purchases of both foreign flour and local flour. The total transaction volume has reached more than 200,000 bags in recent days. However, the Southern merchants have only had scattered transactions due to the current situation, so the factory price has not changed. It is reported that yesterday's retail prices for local flour and Southern merchants were still 4.55 yuan, while prices for Northern customers and returned goods were exceptions. The market trend may stabilize for a while.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market also trended upwards. It was found that a ship of new American flour arrived at the end of last week. In addition to the gradual distribution to various customers and retail sales, the floating capital on the market has decreased. The Northern merchants' demand has been quite good recently, so most of the wholesale dealers are unwilling to sell lightly. Yesterday, they offered more than 40,000 bags of high-end brands such as "Jing Ri Dang Tian", priced at 4.3 yuan in cash and 4.5 yuan for medium-grade flour via wire transfer, which is an increase of five cents compared to before.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market has been maintained for a long time. In recent days, some scattered small lots have arrived from Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. The goods are holding firmly because of high costs. However, the flour market has been declining recently, and the environment is unfavorable. Therefore, sellers have had to make some concessions. Yesterday, more than 300 bags of Zhenjiang wheat were offered at a price of 7 yuan, which was handled by the customer. However, the factory's purchase price is still within 7 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 46,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin and 3,000 bags were shipped to Yantai. Today, 7,000 bags will be shipped to Shantou and 3,000 bags to Xiamen. 2,000 bags of wheat bran will be shipped to Shantou.</p>

<p>Rice Prices at Menzhuang Have Broken the Limit, Jingwu Xian Rice Continues to Arrive</p>
<p>The source of Du rice is still scarce, with only the 7th truck arriving at Hexia, with more than 700 bags from Baozi Su and others, more than 1,000 bags from Xi, 7-800 bags from Chang, and 125 bags from Kunshan. Therefore, the sellers' intentions are still firm. Sales in this area are moving but not solid, and the hoarding is also weak, so the result is a reluctant stabilization. In fact, the situation is already showing softness. The prices of thick and thin Japonica rice are all maintained at the original levels. Du Yang Jian, Bu Jian, and Bian Yuan also have no changes.</p>
<p>The customer's Xian rice has a tendency to hoard and sell back, and the rising trend has been thwarted again. Jingwu Xian rice continues to be transported by truck, and the owners' intention to sell has eased. However, this street and the customer's hoarding are taking advantage of the half-absorption. It is also heard that the highest price of Japonica rice in the market has reached 14.4 yuan, a 4-cent increase. Retailers are also greedy, and the total transaction volume for the day has increased to 3,700-3,800 bags. The market is tired but stabilized again. The selling price of Wu Xian rice is similar to the previous market, and the high-quality goods have been maintained. Jing Xian rice is also offered at a price of 13.35 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Oilcake: Soybean Oil Prices Fluctuate <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Crude Oil Futures Fall by One Yuan</p>
<p>Peanut oil has promising sales to customers, but is sluggish locally. Furthermore, sources continue to arrive, and Jiaozhou oil (transported by sailboat) for delivery in April is still being sold off. Yesterday, 150 pieces were traded at a price of 27 yuan, which is a sharp drop of one yuan compared to the previous market. The situation has not yet stabilized.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: Following the indications from the previous day, the market opened weakly. Later, telegrams were tight, and the situation became clear. The market price once exceeded the previous day's closing price by 2-30 cents. However, in the afternoon, it was known that the Dalian market was downstream, and general operators turned from buying to selling, resulting in a flat result. The previous day's closing price is now the standard for buying and selling, and there is no certainty at all. Therefore, speculation by outsiders is even more blind. The transaction volume yesterday decreased compared to the previous market, but there were many twists and turns throughout the day. According to the overall market, 50 barrels of Fengnian oil were offered at the original price of 32.2 yuan, 200 barrels of Dalian spot oil were priced from 32.55 yuan to 32.3 yuan, 600 barrels for April were also priced from 32.55 yuan to 32.3 yuan, 400 barrels for May were also flat, and the spot oil market was priced from 32.55 yuan to 32.4 yuan. Soybean cake spot goods were not opened. The price of Dalian futures cake was opened at more than 15,000 pieces, priced at 3.13 yuan for May and 3.161-3.165 yuan for June, a decrease of 2-30 cents compared to the previous market. Soybean exports: Yesterday, 30 tons were shipped to Bombay, and today 1,040 bags will be shipped to Xiamen and 400 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Piece Goods: Scheduled Goods from Wenzhou and Ningbo Are Resold One After Another <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong and Guangdong are the Most Enthusiastic in Adding Purchases, Dyed and Unfinished Cloth Sales Continue on this Street</p>
<p>Domestic cloth is slightly weak. This is because the amount of goods loaded by the Wenzhou and Ningbo merchants in eastern Zhejiang is extremely small, and the products scheduled by various factories are resold on the market. The market situation is extremely chaotic. However, the factories' intentions are very firm because the cost of weaving has not decreased, and the Japanese cloth market is stable. The selling price of Japanese fine twill has increased, exceeding that of fine cloth, so the fine twill business of this factory is assisted by spot sales, and the price is still firm. Fine cloth and coarse cloth continue to decline by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Coarse twill is in short supply in the market due to the sudden increase in the destination of dyed fabrics. The factory has opened a price increase of 1-20 cents per piece. The price of Ewo &amp; Co.'s Golden Pagoda bleached cloth has fallen by 10 cents per piece. The price of bleached fine twill from various factories has risen by 1-20 cents per piece. Actual sales are most enthusiastic from Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants, with more than 300 boxes of various colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, poplin, bleached twill, fine cloth, and fine twill being traded. The Tianjin merchants in the north specifically purchased more than 100 boxes of patterned goods such as patterned cloth, poplin, and khaki cloth. Retail sales in this area and sales in the inland guerrilla areas are also quite colorful. The factory is still rushing to produce popular goods day and night to meet sales, and dyeing factories are purchasing a huge amount of unfinished fabrics such as fine twill, satin, patterned cloth, and poplin.</p>
<p>East cloth fell in the morning but rebounded at noon, and the trend is still firm. This is because the dyed and unfinished fabrics of fine cloth and fine twill continue to be sold on this street, and the inventory of fine twill is insufficient, and spot goods are particularly tight. The price of lower-grade actual-sale fine twill was shouted up to 11.7 yuan per piece yesterday, and then raised by another 10 cents. The rise and fall of fine cloth are uncertain and difficult to grasp. The price of Longtou once fell to 11.875 yuan in the early market, but then rebounded and was shouted to 12 yuan at closing time. The overall market trend is not too small.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 400 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Dalian and 500 pieces were shipped to Yantai. Today, 120 pieces will be shipped to Shantou, 20 pieces to Xiamen, and 100 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Sugar Market: Diaoqing Arrives in a Rush, Market More Sluggish <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the rising forward price of 24 Dutch coarse white sugar in June and July by 10 cents, the trade association uniformly followed suit and shouted up the price of spot goods and transit goods. However, today is the day of closing the customs, resulting in few transactions. Only hundreds of packages of high-grade white sugar from local sugar factories were offered at 23.3 yuan, and the second-grade sugar was offered at 22.6 yuan. Diaoqing sugar: It was found that yesterday the Jinan Wheel from Xiamen imported an overwhelming amount, reaching a total of 3,979 bags, as well as 450 bags of Taikoo White sugar, 300 pieces of box sugar, 33 pieces of rock sugar, and 411 bags of Haikou red sugar transferred from Hong Kong. With so many Diaoqing arrivals, the market is even more sluggish, and the market is bound to fall.</p>
<p>Yesterday's imports: 410 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, 4,765 bags from Xiamen.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Seafood: Wenzhou Dried Shrimp Rose Again by Two Yuan <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Raw Starch Arrives Sparsely, Sales are Active</p>
<p>Dried Shrimp: Various merchants continue to handle Wenzhou goods, and the market is tight. Yesterday, the price of Kaicheng was sold at 64 yuan, which is an increase of 2 yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>Raw Starch: Demand is still high, and arrivals are scarce, so the market is quite firm. For example, the current market price for Fei Qilin brand is 17 yuan, and the price for 3X brand is 16.5 yuan, both up half a yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Metals: Eastern White Iron's Downturn Has Not Stopped <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Since the factory has been vigorously pushing out Eastern white iron, coupled with frequent arrivals, the market has been in a slump. The local merchants and Rong merchants are rarely purchasing, so the standard is difficult to be optimistic. For example, 7-foot sheets are sold for 2.75 yuan each, and 6-foot sheets are sold for around 2.23 yuan each, both of which are down 2-30 cents from before. There are only sporadic transactions. The market does not look optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Hunan Tin Sales are Still Smooth <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The sales of pure tin produced in Hunan, China are gradually becoming active every day. It has been found that the destinations are certain organizations and merchants, etc., but the sales in this area are still unmoved. It is heard that yesterday the quoted price was 1,450 yuan per ton, which is 2-30 yuan better than before. It has been found that the actual transaction volume has been around 7-80 tons recently.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Coal: Hoarders Are Eager to Sell <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Underground Market for White Coal is Loosening</p>
<p>Although Henan white coal still appears to be maintained on the surface, the big hoarders are secretly seeking to sell off their goods and cash out as the end of the month approaches. The market situation is chaotic, with a difference of two yuan per ton. The price of Henan screened lump coal is 44 yuan per ton, the price of mixed coal is 42 yuan, and the price of Xiaoji is 39 yuan. The prices from fellow traders' warehouses are listed, and an additional charge for transportation is added. For delivery from Menzhuang, a premium of 4 yuan is added.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Medicinal Materials: Jianqu Production Price Rises by Three Yuan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Because Fuzhou was bombed by enemy aircraft, the production price of Jianqu has risen by three yuan. Arrivals have also been scarce recently, and the trade is unanimously bullish. The sales prospects may turn better in the future, and continued increases should be guarded against.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Bitter Almonds See Fluctuations <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Because the source of bitter almonds was blocked, the top two grades of goods had been sold for 70 yuan per dan, which was quite tight. Therefore, those with goods in hand scrambled to release them, but the destination turned sluggish, and the price immediately fell back to 61 yuan. Recently, Hong Kong has been handling them again, so the price has rebounded, and the current market price is 65-68 yuan, and the remaining stock is also small.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Imports and Exports: Fresh Eggs and Jianmu Arrive in Large Quantities <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, 358 pieces of fresh eggs were shipped from Qidong, and 2,300 pieces arrived from Xingang. The day before yesterday (27th), 114,580 pieces of Matsuban also arrived from Fuzhou.</p>
