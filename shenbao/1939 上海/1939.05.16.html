<h3 id="c11">歐洲局勢已緩和否 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>墨索裡尼前天在都林演說，除了誇耀德義軸心團結的堅固外，認為「歐洲各項問題，均無足以引起戰爭者」。這段話，在英法政界方面所引起的反響是「滿意」；據哈瓦斯社電傳：「倫敦有些人以為義國在德義軸心中具有調節的能力。…軸心各國將在若干時期內避不出暴力舉動，各民治國或可乘此時機。與之進行經濟談」又謂巴黎政界的某負責任深覺「此公語氣頗為溫和，其聲明德義兩國志在和平一段，尤足令人滿意」。然而事實上，歐洲各項問題時否「均無足引起戰爭」？歐洲的局勢，是否確已緩和了？要明白這一點，我們必須對歐洲最近發生的事實作一個簡要的分析。</p>
<p>目前的歐洲，正是「密雲不雨」的情景。民治國家和法西斯國家，侵略國家和被侵略國家，正在勾心鬥角地進行著劇烈的外交鬥爭。每一個外交使節的往來，每一個要人的演說，都含有「潛在戰爭」的意義。但是在這瞬息萬變的國際局勢中，我們卻可以把握幾個基本的趨向。根據基本趨向的認識，我們對於國際形勢的發表，就不致有迷亂的錯覺；一切外交戰略上的言辭，就不足以蒙蔽我們的耳目，擾亂我們的視聽了。</p>
<p>今天歐洲政治的發展，顯然由三個動向相激璗而化合演變；莫謂千端萬緒，莫謂蒼狗白雲，始終不能超越此基本範疇。</p>
<p>第一，德義軸心對民治國家的恫嚇挑寡，將進一步的繼續下去。由於英法的瞻顧彷徨，特別是英國的動搖不定，由是初期的集體安全運動，歸於泡影，爾德義聯合侵略的攻勢因此日益銳利，日益擴大，他們表面先唱了反共軸心的雙簧，背後早已搬演締結軍事同盟的序幕。軍事同盟的對象，無疑是英法，以及其他弱小國家。在目前，波蘭是侵略的第一個目標。而但澤發生事變的危險，即在旦夕。當墨索尼併吞啊比西尼亞與啊爾巴亞的時候，希特勒是幫兇，希特勒餅圖奧地利傑克米梅爾的時候，墨索裡尼是幫兇；他們的調門姿態、是每一次變換的。現在波蘭問題明明危在旦夕，希特勒磨刀霍霍，而墨索里尼高唱其英法紳士所認為滿意的和平。</p>
<p>第二，侵略集團公式的加緊，證明了英法「绥靖」政策的失敗；同時卻也推動了集體的安全制的進展。蘇波，蘇士談話的舉行，英士互助協定的成立，以及英法總理堅決保障波蘭的表示，都是促進集體安全的幾個重要的成就。最可注意的，是一度頓挫的英蘇談話，現在又重行開始；昨天莫斯科消息，且有協定遺精成立的形跡。這證明英法對侵略者妥協政策失敗以後，實逼處此，不得不努力走這條路。</p>
<p>第三，反侵略陣綫的逐漸嚴禁，當然是侵略者所引以為懼的。他們正在採取各種各樣的戰略，先從宣傳上外交上分別反攻。例如德國對英士協定的多方阻撓，對巴爾幹和波羅的海諸小國的百般脅誘，就是明證。德國有所顧忌而暫時展緩其侵佔但澤的行動，騰挪了時間空間，由墨索裡尼來大唱其「和評論」。說什麽「歐洲各項問題，均無足以引起戰爭者」一類的話，正是「欲擒故縱」的策略，在反侵略陣地裏方了催眠的煙幕，在英法散漫的民間散播了麻醉的細菌。</p>
<p>在遠東，日本也正在執行著法西斯集團拆散和平陣綫的聯合戰略。誰都知道日本正在採用種種變態的戰略，向英法進攻。日本屢次揚言拒絕加入德義軍事同盟。又謂將來仍必尊重各國在遠東的利益，這都是誘；建議締結三國對蘇聯的軍事同盟，以及最近日軍在鼓浪嶼的登陸，這都是愶。一句話，這都是響應德義，而使英法趋趄不前的戰略。</p>
<p>從上面幾點的認識，我們可以知道國際兩大陣綫室正在加緊外交搏鬥中。歐洲局勢現在還談不到緩和。今後的能否緩和，那要看外交鬥爭的結果；還要看和平陣綫能否加緊團結，來遏制侵略者的邁進；要看集體安全制能否建立起來；要看英法人民能否督責他們政府改變「妥協」政策，而採取堅決反侵略的政策。</p>

<p>紗市平靜之局、客銷華南。香港。雲南。汕頭等帮採辦尙稱不弱、故市情安謐、但生意良好、市價本看漲面、無奈一般浮多根子鑒於紗價在高峯盤旋、加之日紗售價轉疲、且日見下挫、致久懷堅挺之意、稍帶活動之念、續來斬結、致市態穩定、但操業者與實力充足者。仍在市搜羅不絕、午後因廠方復有開出、人心略平、市態於前市無甚進出、但中身二十支紗售價依然奄奄不振云、</p>

<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市昨日轉爲堅定、開盤之初因利物浦及印度電告良好、因之市價上漲、然後一部份同業結價及盛傳華盛頓與西班牙談判進行賒購棉麥、因之同業心思頗堅、政府之貸款棉放出尙無確息、市上現貨奇緊、此乃棉市上漲之主因、結果上漲七至十二磅音、印度猛漲三羅比、埃及停市、預測上漲十磅音、折合法幣、棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西棉每擔漲八角、印棉漲一元二角、埃及漲九角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易殊爲靜寂、良以海外棉價過高故也、然日來各廠到貨甚多、此亦廠方購意稍懈之因、同業亦趨靜寂、聞同業訂購外棉證金將加多一成、作三成計算、故預料今後之同業交易、將受影響也、茲將昨日棉布、折合送廠價列下、</p>

<p>麵粉　現粉市况、平淡如常、雖値週初之期、客銷毫無起色、查北洋帮去化、已旬日未見活活、原因由於犬津方面、受華興銀行開慕之影響、當地粉價跌去三角之巨、一般糧商、究難明瞭其內慕如何、莫不各有戒心、未敢任意販運、各廠爲維持成本計、更兼深悉目下客銷一時難期開展、故亦暫無遷就之必要、一俟交易活動、再談新盤、是以二號粉廠盤仍站四元五角半之原盤、但回　貨仍有別小五分至一角者、不能作爲正式市面也、統市成交的三萬餘包、均係本街及內地零星辦去、客帮去化、僅併數湊裝之零星小數耳、</p>

<p>洋米邇日被本客秈激漲帶好、昨西貢米已喊高至十九元半、與國外電訊二十元之價祇差半元、倘運費與捐稅上能有特別辦法者、已可通劃、故市上盛傳某洋行已經接受一批定貨、但於糧商洋行雙方、仍未能正式證實、</p>

<p>— EL</p>
<p>—訪問蘇阿德先生印象記—</p>
<p>上星期六，在博物院路亞洲文會（Royal　Asiatic　Society）和會長蘇阿德（Arthur　de　C．Sowerby）先生會了一面，他的我昨日上午，到他家裏去看他。當告訴我住址的時候，他還畫了一個簡略的地圖，並且說：「你看見了福世花園，一轉灣便到了。」</p>
<p>初夏的陽光，像能令人微醉的啤酒，晒在大西路英國兵營前的小草地上，把那花架上鮮艷砍滴的紅玫瑰，烘得一朶一朶的花瓣似乎要綻裂的樣子。一隊蘇格蘭兵正在道旁歇息着，細碎的笛聲，簇新的制服，也似乎受了天氣的支配，微露着柔和的色調哩。</p>
<p>灣進了羅森納路，「市聲」漸漸地離開耳邊，我的目的地，却漸漸地近起來。</p>
<p>「福世花園」已在眼前，再走上五六步路，在寂靜的環境中，忽聽得「答答…答」的打字機聲，從窗子裏隱隱地漏出來，我已經站在被訪問者的門前的階沿上。</p>
<p>蘇先生親自出來應門—兩重碧紗門，他的笑臉和照呼的聲音，剛給我注意的常兒，四條犬同時的向着他們主人的客人進攻。蘇先生一面引導我進去，一而對我說道：一不要睬它們，它們不會咬人的。」十六條腿在我們之前，向着客室裏迅速地移動着。</p>
<p>客室中已經有了一位客人，蘇何德先生爲我介紹時說：「這是倫敦泰晤士報的馬禮遜君」，原來我們是同行。後來我又知道他是馬禮遜博士的哲嗣，生於北平，正爲他所代表的報紙，搜集關於中國博物方面的材料呢。</p>
<p>從談話和現成的材料中，我得知蘇阿德先生的過去，和他愛好和研究中國博物，美術，考古等種種的成績，尤其關於哈克納士夫人和楊君在西藏邊境獵獲世上稀有的珍獸等，Panda白熊的考證。當然，蘇先生在亞洲文會博物院，和他貢獻於科學界的著作也都是我所渴欲知道的。</p>
<p>第一，我問他：「蘇先生，你的華文譯名是不是呌「溫培」，—我們在報紙上常給他譯成這兩字的。</p>
<p>他說：「不，不，不。我呌蘇阿德，這是護照上面的譯名，由來已久哩」。我對他說，「阿」字比較通俗，不過有些人以爲不雅。他却很高興的，一面把他的中文著作—尙未出版—上的華文姓名指給我看；一面又呌我把這三個中國字，填寫在他給予馬禮遜君的亞洲文會工作簡報中他英文姓名後的華文譯名中。</p>
<p>我們叙談所在的客室，環境很是優美：天然方面，因爲隔離市塵較遠，十分靜寂。靠南是一個小圃，綠油油的草坪，充滿了樂觀的色彩，兩扇落地的長紗窗外，搭着一個葡萄架，下面隨意植着些花竹，紅紫鬬妍，異卉爭放，在樂觀的織錦上面，又綴上了許多奔溢的熱情，十足衣現了初夏的景緻。</p>
<p>室中的用具陳飾，不用說，像蘇先生的愛好中國美術一樣，自然而然的生出一秤吸引的力量。古瓷，碎瓦，漢玉，字畫，件件都放在適當的地位—主人是個專家，精於鑒賞，當然不像「貧兒暴富」的只講堆積而已。</p>
<p>蘇先生喜歡狩獵研究動物學，舉凡飛禽，走獸，魚蝦，鱗介，都要仔細考證一下。所以他的愛養狗，似乎除了僅僅愛好之外，也蒙上了科學研究的氣味。他對我們說，那四條犬—常常代表主人對客人表示善意的，是英國種而帶有美國血液的Bull　Dog，兩代同堂，大狗不過六歲光景。當我們談話的時候，兩只小犬常在它們母親的左右分別站着哺乳；吸飽以後，又往來追逐，嬉游不已。在長紗窗的下面，特別爲他們闢有一扇可以進出的小門，直達園子裏，這也足見主人體貼他們之至意了。</p>
<p>我們談了一會關於亞洲文會博物院等之後，蘇先生邀我們參觀他所搜羅的中國古物，動物標本，藏書，和書室等。我們上樓，進了一問小室，那裏面有兩個大橱，兩個書橱，一張半桌—完全是中國式的。好像走進了一家古董舖子，屋頂和地板上似乎也充滿了古氣</p>
<p>蘇先生指示着幾件古物，像秦鏡，漢玉，殷商的銅器，古瓷，牙刻等給我們看，並且解釋它的年代，制作，特徵等。馬禮遜君對這些東西大爲贊賞，我呢，似乎對於古物的關係，有着特殊的情分，祇在腹中爲它們默禱而已。</p>
<p>我問：「蘇先生，你特別愛好些什麼？」</p>
<p>「我什麼都歡喜呢。」</p>
<p>「你特別愛好中國的瓷器麼？」</p>
<p>「是的，我很歡喜中國的古瓷，可惜它們容易碎破，倒不如其他的東西便於處理。</p>
<p>他指着一個牙刻的馬可波羅像，短裝佩劍，神彩奕奕；和一個磁的駱駝，盛稱它們制作之美。</p>
<p>還有許多好束西，在「更上一層樓」呢！四條犬又隨法我們三個人上樓，有它們陪着，旣能調和古董和動物標本的枯燥，而主人呢，又格外覺得有興，譬如由二樓到三樓的扶梯上，蘇先生拍着他的愛犬們說；「我每天上下樓梯，它們不知要跟上跟下多少次呢」！</p>
<p>這是我們博物學者的書室，也就是這屋子的心臟，如果我們不說是蘇先生「絞腦汁」的所在的話，這一間房子和其他各室略有不同了。書籍，文卷，標本，圖畫…等等，眞是琳琅滿目。地板上堆滿了許多書，牆壁上掛了許多鏡框，裏面大都爲蘇光生手描的禽獸標本圖，問或有些風景畫之類，也是這位老先生的手筆。</p>
<p>他指着一幅在山西所寫生的山景道：「我是仿着中國山水筆法畫的呢」，說着，他笑了，其實那畫作得並不壞哩。</p>
<p>兩個大櫥裏，起初我不知道他藏着些什麽寳貝，後來他抽開來給我看，原來裏面藏着的，可以代表着他以往三十年中研究博物學史上光榮的一頁，那這都是動物標本。</p>
<p>好像皮貨舖子裏堆着的灰鼠，狐皮，一只只抽屜裏都是藏着動物標本，大的有四尺多高的猴子標本，小的有二三寸長的老鼠標本，都用樟腦丸窩放着。其他如穿山甲，雉鷄……等等，每個標本都附有一個標簽，記着它的科學名稱，獵取的日期地點等。蘇先生楚製造標本的老手，博物院路亞洲文會附設的上海博物院中，就有許多標本，是他親手「執行死刑」！獵取，和「檢製」！剝皮保藏的。</p>
<p>他在一只長抽屜裏，檢出一隻老鼠標本，毛茸茸的四脚畢直，看上起似乎沒有什麼特異，後來經過了蘇阿德先生的一番說明，恍然它是大有來歷的。</p>
<p>原來這是一種沙漠中的鼠，能够跳躍。一九零八年，蘇阿德參加安特生氏領導的「彼得福公爵的東亞四亞探險隊」，在「哇獨士一沙漠中所捕得的。科學名稱爲Dtpus　So　werby—用蘇先生的姓來表示楚他所發現的。小小的一隻鼠標本，已有如是的來源，無怪他著名的豐富了。</p>

<p>— 恂</p>
<p>現時流行中國社會問，有古代流傳下來的舊醫學，和取諸東西洋的新醫學，然而可以說，這兩種都不是十分健全的。好比一個是　　老叟，一個是　齡孺子：應當如何使老者少之，幼者長之，都變得精强力壯，方始好克服一切病魔；强國强族，庶幾有望。按醫學進步，端賴實騐；基礎學理固不可缺，臨牀經騐，尤為重要。良以醫學無止境，並且變化無窮，應隨時學習，　有進步可言，所以不論執業醫師或醫學生，必須有放膽去做的機會，不受環境的束縛，得到了自由保障，然後能精研深探，反顧吾國社會，乃不得不令人悵然於懷。人民對於醫學常識，不過一知半解：而對於醫學界的信仰，叉是等於零。舊醫處方，倘請「高明裁正」，便好像侮辱而草率：處方藥劑，必定要「四平八穩」，「決無毛病」方好。其實呢，旣然請高明裁正，何必偏勞處方，而四平八穩，決無毛病的藥方，亦決難見效。這並不是國醫先生不肯負責，實在是受了環境的束縛，不敢放膽。我們新醫，豈獨非然。因為我們不是單開方了事，所以動輒得咎的機會，比較還多。近年來醫病糾紛，耳聞目睹，不知凡幾。而大半是不合邏輯的。持權歁人者有之，無琿取鬧者有之，籍端敲詐者亦有之。於是乎深於世故者，遇到了危難病症，祇求無過，不求有功。積極辦法，略涉危險者，不敢輕用。因此對於病家，難免敷衍塞責，對於醫事，放棄了研求進取的機會。茍不然，設有不測，不問是非，便不免詞訟之累，或且更有甚於斯者。試問在這種情形之下，那裹能精研深探？那裹能增進臨床經騐？更那裹能談得到改良進步？這不是由中國醫學進步的一大障碍麼！</p>

<p>（一）乙種維生素缺乏症。即脚氣病。此症本流行於監獄，棲留所，學校，工廠，輪舶，及軍隊駐屯之所。其發作之原因。均認爲食光澤潔白之米。及過於精製之麵包所致。去歲食糧恐慌。市民都食洋米。其色光白而質遜於國米。故食之者。易患脚氣症。而允以監獄與難民所爲最盛。查米之糠皮。與麥之麩皮。富於乙種維生素之成分。而此種成分。乃維持人體之發育及防止多發性神經炎之要素，其維繫心臟之力量。更屬偉大。美國的韋司氏及威爾金氏曾檢查一百廿大的心臟病。確知乙種（乙種維生素之縮號）之缺少。能激起心臟與脈管的變化。而此等變化。都由神經系血行系與心肌而發作。其顯明的症狀。爲速心與慢心症。奔馬律心動症。迷走神經反射過激症。心臟擴大症氣急症肺充血症靜脈弛懈症全身浮腫症。（未完）</p>

<p>勞力與勞智者，其食養亦有所異。蓋因勞力者，其動作使身體全部運動，活血强筋，促進新陳代謝作用，因之堅固筋骨，而生勁力。故其操作，莫不增强發育，是以勞力者，其食慾日增，精力逐漸增加，習武術者，藉以鍛鍊精骨也。但勞智者，其操作之區域，僅限於腦部，腦部乃神經系統，爲百部之主動者也。其組織之細胞，旣屬特殊，且各有專司，故其形態各不相同。於一九三七年，經柏氏（Berger），華氏（Walt）羅氏（Loomiz），哈氏（Harvey），何氏（Hobert），葛氏（Grifiths），及倪氏（Nevin）諸人之研究，知腦內之一切操作，均係感電而生，且其電流，常川不息，惟其電波之變化，循諸感電之異同而別，腦如發生病態，如羊癎瘋，長眠症等，其電波亦現有異狀，故現已用之診斷腦病也。勞智者旣係用腦，其操作又屬電流，其所用之熱量，則微小可知。今經班氏（Benedict）之實騐，半粒花生米所生之熱量，足以供給勞智者一小時之用，查勞智者雖智，其人之體魄；因失應用，則退化。因退化，新陳代謝作用則不振，新陳代謝作用不振，食慾則不旺，食慾不旺，消化能力則日减，消化能力日减，體魄則日虛，體魄日虛，欲無病，其可得乎。</p>
<p>蘭氏（Dr．Lombard）研究勞智者身體各部之體溫，在思想之際，腦部充塞血液，溫度上升，四肢溫度下降，久用則易生頭痛，四肢冷　也。又宣稱食，勞，憇三者，須要分配得法，三者缺一，欲完美健康者，必不可得。葛蘭斯頓（William　Ewart　Hadstone），英國良相也。爲相四决，世界公認之爲大政治家。國遂為之傭有四馬之車，如非禮節所拘，必不一乘，出入壛步行。此外其於公忙之中，剖材鋸木，日必操勞一小時之久，以資銀鍊其體魄。自汽車風行於世，步行視爲不雅，以美國爲允甚，故其國人士，患有糖尿病者，甲於全球，此乃該國汽車大王之所賜，吾人豈可不心　而自省乎哉。</p>
<p>胖非爲健康之徵象，然在常人則視爲良徵，並美其稱曰「發福也」也。蓋發福者，其身體內多增脂肪也。脂肪多，重量加，重量加，行動難，行動難，脂肪越增，因飲食多變爲脂肪，脂肪越多，肌系之空隙易為侵佔，久則成為各部肌系脂肪化症（Fatty　infitration），其人則虛弱更甚，終日思眠，寸步難移，食而不用，其害豈可限量乎。（本節完）</p>

<p>— 邢光祖</p>
<p>早期提倡新文學的人，經過了不少的困難，終於斬除了那些「頑固」的　　；廿多年來靠着許多新的作家的栽培和灌溉：新文學的園地裏，已然產生出不少美麗的花卉，但是近年來，却有同一種子內所生長出來的植物，在這園子裏妨害着其他值物的生長，我認爲是很可惜的。</p>
<p>我常常以爲整個新文學運動是一個新詩的運動，不信，我們很可以舉出一些實例。用白話寫散文的有明淸的小品，以白話作小說的有曹雪芹施耐庵做前驅，甩白話寫戲劇的有元代的戲曲（允其是那些念白），至於以白話寫詩的，還純粹是新文學運動的產兒。白居易雖然想使詩「老嫗能解一，但祇還是詩的理論，沒有實踐。幷且我們試看良友新文學大系文學理論集內胡適之先生的「逼上梁山」一文，就會明白他的文學革命的主張是以白話寫詩做骨幹的。所以新詩是新文學運動的特產，是新文學運動的主腦；那些侮蔑新詩的，就是侮蔑新文學運動。</p>
<p>侮蔑新詩的，除了先前彭嘯殊所說的「古迷」人物外，很出人意料的，却是一些話劇編作者，丁西林在他的獨幕劇「隻馬蜂」中，曾經諷刺過新詩，但是好像爲時間所消蝕，已不爲人注意。比較近一點的，如阿英的「春風秋雨」，借用劇中人倪教授的口吻，用幾段「歪詩」來贊美他的愛人鳳雲，以及最近馮執中所改編的戲劇名呌「裝腔作勢」內，其中有一大段是嘲弄新詩的，而且裝腔作勢得很利害。不過（一個很有力的「不過」），新詩雖然經過了一隻馬蜂的毒刺，依舊巍然地存在着：春風秋雨，祇是一時地捺亂人心；至於裝腔作勢，也徒然使人感到它做作和虛僞而已。</p>
<p>記得史蒂文孫（R．L．Stevenson）會經說過：「我時常猜疑，覺得公衆趣味是一種混雜的產物，是墨守成法和虛僞的結合。」對於新詩，那些頑固派抱輕視的態度，正是因爲他們墨守成法的執見太深的緣故，至於那些諷刺新詩的文學家，也祇因爲對於新詩缺少深切的認識和研究，一則不看新詩一則淺嘗新詩，兩派都是沒有入門，都是俗人，不足以談詩。「說詩管蒯」曾說，「好詩乃俗人之藥」，我也是同樣的主張這些「心俗」的人必需消除他們岐視的心理，多讀一些新詩集才是。</p>
<p>也許一般諷刺新詩的劇作者，並沒有存心。在戲劇裹運用一點諷刺，正如藥店廣告一樣，不過是想多吸引一些觀衆。例如馮執中的「裝腔作勢」（可以不必用引號）中所寫的一首詩：「啊，啊，啊！偶而地不留心，這還不要緊，我偷偷地望了你一眼，你兩隻電燈泡似的眼睛偷去我的心。賊啊，賊啊」！（這是我從中法劇藝社演員台詞中記起的，或者有錯誤。）他在戲劇裏參揷了這段，也許是用乖訛的（Incongruous）言辭，來換取看客的笑聲的。如其是這樣，那麼我們也要要求作者的健全的藝術良心。</p>
<p>同時我們也得反躬自省，來細察一下現有的新詩壇，當然我們不能吾認許多新詩的確是有缺陷和幼稚的。多年來蝸牛似地演進，確乎會呌一般愛瞧熱鬧的人着急。不過我總相信幼稚並不足詬責新詩，時間還長，大器向來是晚成的，（祇要你不夭折，你總會見到它花開茂盛的季節。）况且新文學中，不論是散文，小說，或是戲劇，都犯着同樣的症候。誰能說曹禺的「日出」或魯迅的「徬徨」「吶喊」勝過孫毓棠的「寳馬」八百行的長詩？在這裹，我跟洵美先生一樣，要套用語堂先生的調子說；新文學的成功，新詩的成功也。」</p>
<p>新詩在新文學內的所以不鋪張的原由，據人家說：「我們祗有寫新詩的人，而沒有讀新詩的人。」任何雜誌的編者，總感到新詩的投稿人最多；而所有書賈都覺得詩刊和詩集的銷路最少。這種畸形的現象之所以存在，據我推測，不外乎兩點：一是因爲詩人們大抵是孤芳自賞和不事鋪張的，最上乘的詩人慣常是最拙劣的廣告宜傳員。幷且詩人自有他完整的個性和高尙的趣味，他決不肯投羣衆所好，悉心遷就。另一點是因爲從事文藝者或詩的批評家缺乏同情和鼓勵，這種無情的抨擊與冷酷的諷刺，平常總是那些勢利小人（Snobs）的技倆。</p>
<p>末了，我們得感謝那些譏諷新詩的人，因爲「諷刺是善意的朋友」，朱吉爾（Churchill）不是說過的麽？同時我們也得規勸那些挖苦新詩的人，因爲培根（Bacon）說得好：「那些有諷刺人家的脾氣的和使人害怕他們機智的鋒鋩的人，得祖心人家把他們永遠地記起。」</p>

<p>—老奶奶的故事—</p>
<p>上面有命令下來，要我們去襲擊靑鎭。</p>
<p>本來，我們是以襲擊爲事的，奉到了命令，自然就應該進行。可是，王明源隊長，和其他幾個隊長，商量之下，却不免於躊躇，原因是我們不曉得靑鎭上的實情，不能作完備的佈置，所以便也不能貿然就去。我說，這事還是只有請教老奶奶。</p>
<p>我一想起老奶奶，大家都笑了開來。『好，馬上去請老奶奶來。』王明源說。</p>
<p>老奶奶不知正在作什麼，拍着衣裳從裏面出來了。</p>
<p>『靑鎭你很熟麽』？王明源問。</p>
<p>『很熟；我有一個姨甥就住在那鎭上。』</p>
<p>『你知道現在靑鎭上有多少「人」？多少槍？多少砲？』</p>
<p>『這個我却不知道。』</p>
<p>『你有方法知道麼？』</p>
<p>老奶奶想了一想，點點頭說，『有方法的；限我三天給回信，好不好？』</p>
<p>這樣說好之後，她就去準備，似乎忙了一夜。明天，她一個人背了幾袋東西，就到了她的姨甥錢阿森的家裏。</p>
<p>她對錢阿森說，近來家裏零用錢一個都沒有，想到鎭上來作一些小買賣。她將布袋裏的東西倒了出來，錢阿森一看，原來是各種可吃的蠶豆。錢阿森並不以爲意，因爲這樣的事情，是眞正的鄕下老婦人所常幹的。</p>
<p>在明天一早，她向錢阿森借了一隻淺沿的大籃子，將各種豆放在裏面，就到街上去賣。她已問明白，那些（人）駐紮的地方是公大繭行，所以她就一直到那繭行對面的大茶樓上來。</p>
<p>她在茶樓上略略兜了一個圈子，賣了一些豆之後，就　趄地走到臨街的窓口來，遙矚着對面繭行的大門不走開。</p>
<p>繭行門口有人站着岡，進進出出的人很多。她一目不瞬的注視着，似乎要找一個熟人的樣子。有時有人喊她買豆，她也幾乎忘了。</p>
<p>『你這老太婆，爲什麽生意不做，專門看着對面？』多間的茶客中，有人這樣說。</p>
<p>『鄉下人是難得看見異物的，所以要賞識實識了。』也有人這樣代她回答。</p>
<p>『可不是，』她一看見有人和她搭話，便連忙接應上去，『我們鄕下人眞是難得看見的。不曉得這裏有多少「人」？』</p>
<p>『不少吧；不大仔細。』究竟是不關心，不負食的答復。</p>
<p>她又在窓口看了好久，終於注意到了一個人。這人大的近四十歲的年紀，黑赤赤的臉腔，穿着短衣，是個農人的模樣。他已進出了好幾决，每决出來時是空手的，進去時便有一些東西在手裹，可見又是個當差的。正當她幾經考慮，要想下去的時候，這人却走進這邊屋裹，上樓來了。她心頭一喜，就作着她的準備。</p>
<p>那人一上樓，毫不猶豫就到窓口的一個座位上坐下了。茶博士一看見他坐定，不等他開口，早就將茶送了來。</p>
<p>『吃些五香豆吧？』老奶奶好像很隨便的樣子，走到他的桌邊。</p>
<p>『不要。』他喝了一口茶說</p>
<p>『那末黃沙豆爽脆些。』她指指籃子裏。</p>
<p>『好，就來一些黃沙豆。』他看了看籃子。</p>
<p>老奶奶一聽，就滿滿地握了兩把，放在他的面前，並且笑喀嘻看着他的面孔說：</p>
<p>『我好像是認得你的；你住在那裹？』</p>
<p>『我住在李家橋。』說時，他也對老奶奶看看，見她是六十來歲一個鄉間老婦人，身上的衣服雖舊，却很淸潔，滿面春風，和氣迎人，好像正是個熟人。『我也好像認得你，』他不免也就湊了這一句。</p>
<p>『喔，李家橋。我娘家就在李家橋。』老奶奶高興的聲氣。『你呌什麼？』</p>
<p>『我呌李金根。』</p>

<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>寂寞的時候，心頭的冷落禁不住幻想的空愁，像是墜入地球的深縫，掉進千萬丈的深淵去。</p>
<p>一身凉，攪着寂靜的思想。</p>
<p>我要唱，唱一曲沒有聲音的歌。</p>
<p>記得（其實是一個美麗動人的謊）多少年前，天上人間是一般的，人與神亦沒有分野。春天的風像一陣輕烟，在空中飄出一座女神的模像—你信嗎？你相信人間眞有過和平嗎？</p>
<p>朋友，別傻！除了女神之外，你也應該知道還有魔鬼吧。魔鬼，是的，魔鬼也會在太陽落山以前跋扈過一時。牠會踏破了女神的像，也打碎了和平的高碑。但是，你也該懂得：太陽打東邊起來，雖然中午時，威勢逼人，可是終於在西邊落山。</p>
<p>我又記得幼時最愛看的景物—湖上落日。</p>
<p>是玄武湖。柳枝的縫里，紅色的雲中，我看見過血輪沉沒在台城的磚石下面。那時候，湖面的色，湖面的空氣，湖面的韻律，綴成了阿波羅筆下的風景畫。</p>
<p>也是北海。漪瀾堂前的廊間，仿膳的岸邊，五龍亭的左右，我曾留下個不深不淡的痕迹。如今叉是五月天氣，落日的美景又是上市的時候，我在地球的深縫，千萬丈的深淵里，拾得一片記憶。南京，北平，雖不是家鄕，也還是親切的故土；値得在這一片記憶中掏出一絲情趣，留在眼珠上，神經邊，供我寂寞時的憑念。</p>
<p>我要唱，唱一曲淡有聲音的歌。</p>
<p>可是我遠聽得一聲低音奏，吟着生命的力。</p>
<p>瞧，天邊浮來一朶藍—是女神隨手灑在碧空的星點—是宇宙頭上的一絲柔髮—是天上人閒生命的源泉。</p>
<p>當我憶起舊日看得高興的落日美景；我笑了，冥想中，太陽浮在水面，飄着輕快的調子。穿過水面，在泥沼深處，又有魔鬼的形迹，沉在水底。</p>
<p>不是嗎，太陽雖然在午間威勢逼人，可是終於在西邊落山。</p>
<p>我要唱，唱一曲沒有聲音的歌。</p>
<p>但是，一身凉，　着寂靜的思想；抬頭，又瞧見天邊一朶藍，那永生的美。</p>

<p>來了陣在風，從遙遠的天際；吹開了黃金夢的包裹，在這裹跳出了喜悅的種子。</p>
<p>幻夢並沒有成泡沫，印上了會心的徵笑的深渦。</p>
<p>一切的陰霾，將摧殘盡了，東方有些微暈，帶來了活躍的聲響。晨曦的光芒，照明了鬱塞的心坎，啟勁了心扉，是一個偉大的時表呀！</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>我以爲話劇作家的故意運用不像樣的新詩，並不能說存心「侮蔑」新詩，因爲一則話劇作家固然爲了「博取看客的笑聲」，有時要來上這一手，無傷大雅，而一則有些新詩的確也不免於濫調，如劇中所說的那樣，不妨諷刺一下。我就看不出這些話劇作家在故意「侮蔑」整個新詩。不過那光祖先生的意見，也很有理由，新詩是新文學運動的重要收穫之一，不應予以摧殘，所以樂於爲之發表。我希望不會因此引起什麽糾粉，因爲大家本來都是新文學運動的忠實信徒。</p>

<h3 id="c129">源來之菸及菸水談 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>連口見上海市水菸業公會為假水菸事，登有啟事。歷述水菸之起源及其利益，并以漢丞相諸葛亮征孟獲時所用　藥芸香草，其後轉輾移榷於甘肅蘭州一帶，即為水菸之　矢，此則未敢為之定論。但據舊時筆記所載，云菸自小呂宋等地，於明萬曆年間流入，稱之為「淡巴菰」，即Tobacco之譯音也，自為外邦輸入無疑，然亦未嘗說明於淡巴菰未輸入前，中國即無菸之出產；所可斷言者，吸煙之風，明季漸興，爾自清初迄今，愈見其盛行，俗諺有之，「小韃子敲潮煙」於以見滿人進關之後，吸煙之流行。</p>
<p>舊時之煙，大都為旱煙之類，以竹竿通節為煙管，一頭挖一孔，以納煙，一頭吸之。煙桿甚短，可以藏之於腰際，煙爐乃敲去其煙蒂，故曰敲煙。煙草切成絲，以荷包盛之。滿洲人腰擊荷包，其原始之作用，為遊獵時盛儲乾糧，亦以為貯煙之用。其後荷包乃成為為清皇室珍賞裝飾之品，　與原意相失矣。</p>
<p>何以知清初吸煙之風始盛，此則可於「禁」字知之。大凡一種新嗜好發生，至於相習成風，引起當局之注意時，必出於藥，禁則往往又不生效力，反促其盛行。清初對於吸煙之記載漸眾：如海寧相國陳文簡公元龍，及溧陽相國史文靖公貽直，均以吸煙著稱於當時。相傳二公酷嗜淡巴菰，不能釋手，清聖祖惡之，時南巡駐蹕德州，特以水晶煙管賜之，二公喜甚，用以吸煙，火焰直衝喉際，嗆甚，懼爾不敢再吸，康熙乃傳禁天下吸煙，蔣學士陳錫有詩紀其事：</p>
<p>碧椀瓊漿漱艷開，肆筵先已戒深杯，</p>
<p>瑤池宴罷雲屏敞，不許人間煙火來。</p>
<p>禁雖禁爾吸者吸，嗜之者寧可挨餓，爾煙有不能不吸者。如武進劉文定公綸未遇時，貧至絕食，以竹煙袋乞煙草於鄰，鄰人請之曰：「煙草消食，勿多吸也。」公笑受之。</p>
<p>蓋時人以煙可消食，故鄰人識笑其無食爾猶不忘情於煙也，如此。</p>
<p>尤可證明康熙雖禁煙爾煙乃流行者，如紀大煙斗是也。</p>
<p>紀大煙斗者，即是紀文達公曉嵐也。紀喜吸煙，其煙斗甚巨，一斗之煙，自出寓至朝門始盡，故有此稱。紀嘗值上書房，某日經乾隆帝召見，紀以為數言可畢，勿　間納煙斗於靴筒中爾入見，不意談甚久，煙斗之煙內炙皮膚，紀頓現局促不安之狀，高宗怪爾詢之，紀以實對，曰：「臣靴筒內走了水，」高宗乃揮之出，靴筒走水，恐亦亙古所罕聞也。</p>
<p>水菸之製，亦見於乾隆間，蓋乾隆一代，為清之黃金時代也。享用之奢侈，當無期匹。寒煙之自改為水菸，疑亦發生於此時，蓋自旱煙進而為水菸，乃為吸煙術之進步·旱煙之管，至多以銅為煙斗，象牙金屬為其嘴。水菸袋則全以金屬為之，光亮整潔，一也；菸自水中濾過，氣味和順，二也；可以用人裝煙，三也。何以知其為乾隆時代已盛行，則可於乾隆四十一年十月徇曹閣學之請，禁吸水煙是也。又何以之其以前尚未流行，則可觀於紅樓夢一書，所紀皆為雍正至乾隆初元事。紅樓夢書中於吸煙竟未之多見，只有一百零一回中，薛寶釵向鳳姐兒　了一袋煙所謂一袋煙者，其為旱煙可知·假使當時已有了水菸，窮奢極慾之賈氏，決無不有此物之理·而且賈母王夫人以及赦政諸人都不見吸煙，惟鼻煙已自西洋流入，書中亦已見及其時之水煙袋，似乎非一般人民所同得享用。即官吏之間，於旱煙水菸二者之間，尚有階級之分。咸豐八九年間，王有齡經兩江總督何桂清之拔　，不數年間，以一監大使，爾至江蘇布政使，與總督互相倚重，視巡撫蔑如也。巡撫趙德轍稱疾去，繼之者為湖南布政使徐有壬。徐知王之專橫也，思有以折之。會王往謁，左右兩俊僕各執白銅煙袋，裝送水菸，徐語之曰：「君仕至兩司，尚未知官場通例乎？藩司謁巡撫，但許吸旱煙，不准吸水煙，君雖才略無雙，定例其未可遠也！」　揮二俊僕去，王出不意，喪氣爾出。可知常時之水菸，顯有階級存乎其間也。</p>
<p>又該啟事述及水菸之益，余亦深服其說。蓋余早年喜吸水菸，其後兼吸紙煙，近八年來二者俱已摒絕矣。水菸之吸用，在余看來，確實吸煙術中之最衛生者。蓋煙之為害：一則火氣直逼咽喉，故喉頭常多病，余所以將二十七年吸煙歷史，忍痛割絕，正為當時喉嚨啞之故，；二則煙毒尼古丁吸入肺腦，俱易為害，惟水菸乃以煙氣經水中濾過之作用，一部分煙毒已溶解於水中，可以減少毒質。清季齊先生曾根據水菸袋之原理，爾有衛生旱煙管之創作，系於煙管之內，置有螺旋一枚，使煙氣經過螺旋之盤旋，爾冷卻粘滯於螺旋之上，以減少煙毒直接沖入喉際·　師并盛稱水菸袋吸煙之進步。謂外國紙煙有其便利爾無期衛生·惜乎水煙袋攜帶較不便：二則煙蒂滿地噴，易致不潔：三則在現代之辦公室內吸用水菸，在形式上當然無紙煙之易於收藏·實則將來如注意到吸菸之真意義，焉知不有一日重複以水菸袋為最妥善煙具·蓋水菸與紙煙之比較，無非為時髦與不時髦，便利與不便利，爾此兩點尚非水菸根本失敗之原因也。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十回　椎髻青裙賢良有母　銀髯翠袖矍鑠是翁</p>
<p>今天朱愛人的汽車來時，早聽得鳴鳴的喇叭聲了兩聲，這個喇叭聲是聽熟了，他們知道是愛人的汽車來了。朱村長今天因為是星期日，所以在家。倘在往常日子，他上午要到小學校里去，下午要到村事務所去，一天也是很忙的。他正坐在自己的　裳籬下，曬著太陽，知道他的孫女兒來了。自己孫女兒是不客氣的，但她今天是自己伴著兩位同學而來的，我們要盡主人之禮。因此他便命朱愛妻迎接了出去。朱太太知道今天家中有賓客來臨，要留她們吃飯的，早已忙碌一早晨。雖然家中也還有人幫忙，但朱太太還是事必躬親，方繼稱了她的心。此刻剛脫去了她胸前的白蘭裙，也隨著朱愛妻出來。愛人把她的母親，和她的堂姐，介紹給何家兩位小姐。何家兩位小姐，先和朱愛　　著手，見她是一個健　顧家的女子。開出口來，又好似非常爽朗的。再見到朱太太時，完全是一個　下已過中年婦人的打扮，全身都是布衣服，再也我不出一些見絲織物。她頭上的頭髮，也沒有剪去，卻高高地挽著一個小髮髻，不過顯得狠是整潔。原來朱太太的頭髮，不是沒有剪去過得。在朱村長那時當遊擊隊長的當兒，朱太太也投身在救護隊中。她是　因健有力的婦人，救護隊中也非常歡迎她。因為女人們總比較男子力氣小，但朱太太則不然。譬如一個傷兵，兩人抬不動的，朱太太便一個人把他負起來了。她本來原也沒有剪去頭髮的，因為在救護隊中，日夜辛苦，不能有什麽工夫，自己去理髮。一過十幾天，頭髮便蓬亂得不堪，而且發出氣味來了。朱太太是喜歡爽快的，　自己的頭髮里不清楚，便索性不理了，她用一把剪刀，齊根兒一剪，再用清水洗洗，不是比長髮快捷得多嗎。她的剪髮，和家人因為美觀爾剪髮，其意旨是大不相同的。到後來時世平了，她還是養起頭髮來，本來這也是各人的自由。何家兩位小姐見朱太太這樣的簡樸，真教人肅然起敬。因想到這位太太，聽說是個農婦出身，沒有受到什麽學問的，但她卻天然有一　無學問中德學問呢。</p>

<p>無論GIMAN的智勇驚人，無論偵探網的佈置過密，爾社會上惡勢力的存在，也正比例地隨著滋長；即使在金元國家中，那些暴露性的電影，就是最有力的證據·至於怎樣才能徹底消滅這種惡勢力的滋長呢？那是「觀感」以外的問題了。</p>
<p>「我入地獄」里的流氓首領布爾勃南遜，竟是和政客朋比為奸。及至犯罪證據確實，被判入獄，也由於他的特殊勢力，能夠在獄中出入自如，而且奪去了監獄長的職權。雖然劇作者聲明這些人物都是虛構的，可是爲什麽要虛構這些人物來編制「我入地獄」呢？這也許正是「欲蓋彌彰」吧！</p>
<p>新聞記者丁姆海登，不但於報端撰文，對惡勢力抨擊不遺餘力，並且要證實這流氓在獄中橫暴的情形，竟故意犯罪入獄，去　集證據，這種「我不入地獄，誰入地獄」的大無畏精神正是此時此地的新聞記者應該深自反省的。</p>

<h3 id="c135">小型影劇院　對待顧客應講禮貌 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 顧不問</p>
<p>五月十日，本報載有「光畢影戲國際查兇怒顧客一場紛擾」之新聞一則，內云：稽查强拖顧客，老叟購理力爭，有事後呼喝自傲，致屬另客之怒，仍欲二次强拖，全體代抱不平等語。字裹行間，願滑稽查之威福，惹起顧客之反響。此事難非目見，誰是誰非？姑不置論，但該稽查之目中無客，禮貌太差，是可斷言也。筆者前會以涉足該院可以其距程之近也，至則人頭擠擠，爭先購票，而售票甚慢。迨余擠近窗口，幾告客滿，繞幸一票在手，然仍挨立人護，焦候幕門之開放，一時汗酸氬臭，挨鼻難甚，而不容卻退縮也。門有守衛者二三，莫不雄赴赴氣昂昂，一若鬼門關之獄卒，睥睨一切，唯我獨尊。余所不解者，一般受其「廉價」之誘惑，不遠數里而來，何竟甘受如是之屈服乎？惟在此種職員之心目中，以為在此「廉價」勢力之下，「禮貌」二字，似乎絕對無效？於是根本之錯誤，即基於此矣。及至幕門一啓，顧客奪門而入，秩序大亂等力弱者往往不得其門，婦孺　被傾跌，或成眾推之的，此書院內處理之不得法也。</p>
<p>尚有一家與「光華」可稱昆仲之某影戲院，其中收票稽查，以及茶役，亦皆缺乏禮貌，同具侮客之病，每見收票補票，常起無謂之糾紛，一若「廉價」即等於救濟性質，而視顧客為難民。某夕，筆者亦會一度觀光，座前有一女客，懷抱二三歲之小孩，收票時，稽查定欲令其補購一票，女客人以小孩不占座位，不允補票，即見茶役在旁惡罵，稽查一再書問，最後竟稱此地，不可看白戲等語，侮辱女客。當時，余甚代抱不平，奈以茶役助威，無禮太甚，或恐吃其眼前之虧。今日果見光華新聞，登諸報章，可知紛擾之素因，出來已久。愛將某院員役侮客觀盛，附志於此。筆者此向院，本無恩怨，實以見聞所及，竭誠告勉而已。蓋規模雖小，票價雖廉，便不有忠門前之冷落，但顧客究屬營業之對象，亦不可不加禮貌，已符商業之道德也。是否採納，是否逆耳，日觀該院以後之秩序，即可證驗我言之不謬也。（義實戲金）</p>

<p>— 德綱</p>
<p>銀幕歐默大師卓別林的作品久已不見問世了，最近卓別林林氏因鑒於許多野心國家的獨裁者任意凌辱弱小民族，置正公義理於不願，所以他變李然親自出馬，主演獨裁者（Diccacor）一片，片中的大意是描寫一個流浪的乞丐，被禁困在一個德國的集中營裹，後來因為這個乞丐的面貌酷似當今德國元首希特勒，於是一般神經過敏的朋友，便當他眞是布特勒，請他安然出獄，以後他便將錯就錯，鬧成許多令人棒腹的笑話。</p>
<p>自從卓別林攝製「獨裁者」一片的消息傳到蘇聯的便決議會譽動章，蘇聯最高令全國，卓別林五十誕辰那天起，各戲院都一致放映卓氏所攝影片一星期，以致紀念，因為卓氏並非單是美國好萊塢一個藝人而已，他是利用電影反抗資本主義和資產階級的有力者，他的破靴，冬瓜帽，和舊手杖，真是打倒集權政治鞏固民主政治最佳的法寶，所以凡愛自由和平的國家人民，都應一致向他致最敬禮。</p>

<p>好萊塢哥影片公司也都各派攝影配記者，來到中國各地去攝製難民的複雜書，及流離頗沛的情形，以開麥拉眼來代替電訊，自然是更真實，更可發引人類的同情。哥倫比亞公司現在特地攝製了一倦短片，片名叫「難民」，全片是一隻歌曲，配上後各地攝來的戰事寫真與難民頗沛的畫面：並且製成英語，華語，德語。西班牙語，及猶太語物種拷貝。片首附有字幕，說明該片的製作表示目的，僅在向各國兵災難民表示同情而無政治主義。將來開映時，全部收入即作為救濟難民之用。</p>

<p>（一）劇本　「五胡情侶」與荊軻傳之劇情，均取材於眾續，意義甚為深長。編劇者麥友蕓君，煞費苦心，成此佳作，洵學劇界特殊之新發現。</p>
<p>（二）人才　該社人才濟濟，如郭琳爽·唐觀鵬·麥友蕓·鐘鳳華·郭傭·羅慧堂·馮永康等，悉係一時俊傑，而角色支配，尤極適合，故演出方面，均能稱職，導演楊業堂君勞苦功高。</p>
<p>（三）演技　此二劇均係古裝名劇，表情全在於細處出之。各個角色，演來婿合劇中人身份，且演技嫺熟，當今令人有意想不到之滿意。此非過譽，蓋事實如此，如五胡情侶一劇，郭琳爽飾主角范　，將當時剛强男兒氣與溫柔兒女態，在不同的情景下，分別傳出，誠屬表情能手。而鐘鳳華小姐飾西施，唱工做工，均極穩重，扮相豔霞，尤覺神似。他若袁文紹飾伍員之端莊之佳，俱　化境。（義賣默金）</p>

<p>大李五好惡作劇</p>
<p>有些最討人厭的小孩子　和專門好訂聽新聞無事忙兒，都一齊跟在爐子屁股後頭，放佛傑瞧騎木爐子遊街似的，越聚人越多，幾乎阻礙交通，後來巡警看了，遣派他的不是，說他故意替它的爐子勾上臉，招搖過市，犯了警章，差一點沒把他帶到巡警局去。他又累又氣又羞又冤，直把大李五罵了一路子，沒過幾日，他也想了個報復的法兒。</p>
<p>有一天大李五演「搶桃穆天王」，他去劇中的楊六郎，等他出場後，大蓄類故意攀著去報子的這人說東道西，老不讓他出場，理順亭坐在臺上，專候報子到來報告宗保被擒的消息，方能捉搶上馬進奔穆柯寨去，誰知報子已被余老闆圈住，後告的人又都受過李大五的戲弄，因此就不約而同的全都置之不理，也不替他代催一聲，他枯坐在臺上左等也不來，右等也不來，雖是用眼睛向上場門溜了兩遍，仍然毫無動靜，按舊劇的規矩，場上的人是不許無緣故向後臺喚人的，況且報子是離開軍營，在外邊探聽消息的人，當然與時常侍候元帥的中等不同，李大五往日一肚皮壞主意，最是機械不過的聰明人，然而今天冷不防卻被人在這種小關節上擺弄一下，讓台下喊了幾個倒好。可見好等人家開心的人，今天也有丟人現眼的時候呢。幸而李五資格老練，還能力自鎮定，他暗想老僵住在臺上不是辦法，隨即編了幾句詞道：「天到這般時候，還不見探馬來，來，帶馬。」他藉此才趟了下去。（一二）</p>

<p>(Luoyang) The tense situation in southern Henan has stabilized since the Chinese army successively recovered Xinye and Tanghe, greatly boosting morale. In this decisive battle to retake Tanghe, the Chinese army killed and wounded as many as a thousand Japanese soldiers in one night of fierce fighting, killed five or six hundred Japanese war horses, and captured seventy or eighty. The remaining main force of the Japanese army was defeated by the Chinese army. This is the unprecedented great victory in southern Henan this year. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The Chinese troops advancing towards Ping's County, southeast of Tanghe, after a fierce battle, captured Ping's County today, annihilating countless Japanese soldiers.

<p>(Tokyo) Today, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman admitted that the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, the American Ambassador Grew, and the French Ambassador Henry had all made representations to the Japanese government regarding the Japanese bombing of Chongqing, and said that the content of the representations made by the three ambassadors was generally the same, but none were in the nature of protests. It is believed here in well-informed circles that the Japanese government will refute the representations of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France based on the following reasons: The Japanese side considers Chongqing to be the location of the National Government. According to a news dispatch from Chongqing on May 1, Chongqing's air defense equipment includes twelve anti-aircraft guns and sixty anti-aircraft machine guns, indicating that the city is not undefended. Any losses suffered by foreign consulates due to Japanese bombing are regrettable, but the Japanese aircraft were forced to retaliate against the fierce bombardment of Chinese anti-aircraft guns. It is rumored that these anti-aircraft gun positions were installed near the consular area. All countries should demand that the National Government remove Chinese military equipment near foreign property to prevent damage to foreign property. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Has the European Situation Eased? <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>In his speech in Turin the day before yesterday, Mussolini, in addition to boasting about the solidarity of the German-Italian Axis, asserted that "none of the European issues are enough to cause war." This statement has been met with a "satisfied" reaction in British and French political circles. According to a Havas dispatch, "Some people in London believe that Italy has the ability to mediate within the German-Italian Axis.... The Axis powers may avoid violent actions for some time, and the democracies may take this opportunity to conduct economic talks with them." A responsible figure in Parisian political circles reportedly felt that "this person's tone is quite moderate, and his declaration that Germany and Italy are committed to peace is particularly gratifying." However, are "none of the European issues enough to cause war" in reality? Has the European situation truly eased? To understand this, we must briefly analyze the recent events in Europe.</p>
<p>The current situation in Europe is like "dense clouds but no rain." The democracies and the fascist states, the aggressor states and the victim states, are engaged in intense diplomatic struggles, each plotting against the other. Every visit by a diplomatic envoy, every speech by a key figure, contains the meaning of "latent war." However, in this rapidly changing international situation, we can grasp a few basic trends. Based on an understanding of these basic trends, our pronouncements on the international situation will not be misled by illusions; the rhetoric of all diplomatic strategies will not be able to deceive our eyes and ears or disturb our hearing and vision.</p>
<p>The development of European politics today is clearly the result of the interaction and transformation of three trends; no matter how complex and varied, they cannot transcend this basic scope.</p>
<p>First, the German-Italian Axis's intimidation and provocation of the democracies will continue further. Because of the British and French hesitancy and hesitation, especially the British vacillation, the initial collective security movement has become a bubble, and the offensive of the German-Italian joint aggression has therefore become increasingly sharp and expanding. On the surface, they first sang a duet about the Anti-Comintern Pact, but behind the scenes, they had already staged the prelude to the conclusion of a military alliance. The target of the military alliance is undoubtedly the United Kingdom, France, and other small and weak countries. Currently, Poland is the first target of aggression. The danger of an incident in Danzig is imminent. When Mussolini annexed Abyssinia and Albania, Hitler was an accomplice; when Hitler annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, Mussolini was an accomplice; their tone and posture changed each time. Now that the Polish question is clearly on the verge of crisis, Hitler is sharpening his knives, while Mussolini is singing the praises of peace that British and French gentlemen find satisfactory.</p>
<p>Second, the intensification of the aggressor group formula proves the failure of the British and French "appeasement" policy; at the same time, it has also promoted the progress of collective security. The Soviet-Polish and Soviet-Turkish talks, the establishment of the British-Turkish mutual assistance agreement, and the firm expression of the British and French prime ministers to guarantee Poland are all important achievements in promoting collective security. Most noteworthy is that the once-stalled British-Soviet talks have now restarted; yesterday's Moscow news even suggested that an agreement has already been reached. This proves that after the failure of the British and French policy of compromise with the aggressors, they are forced to take this path.</p>
<p>Third, the gradual prohibition of the anti-aggression front is naturally feared by the aggressors. They are adopting various strategies to launch counter-attacks separately from a propaganda and diplomatic perspective. For example, Germany's various obstructions of the British-Turkish agreement and its various threats and inducements to the Balkan and Baltic states are clear evidence of this. Germany, with some reservations, has temporarily delayed its actions to occupy Danzig, buying time and space for Mussolini to sing his "peace commentary," saying things like "none of the European issues are enough to cause war," which is precisely a "playing hard to get" strategy, releasing a hypnotic smoke screen in the anti-aggression camp and spreading the germs of anesthesia among the British and French public.</p>
<p>In the Far East, Japan is also implementing the joint strategy of the fascist group to dismantle the peace front. Everyone knows that Japan is adopting all kinds of abnormal strategies to attack the United Kingdom and France. Japan has repeatedly stated that it refuses to join the German-Italian military alliance. It also said that it will continue to respect the interests of all countries in the Far East, which is all inducement; suggesting the conclusion of a three-country military alliance against the Soviet Union, as well as the recent landing of Japanese troops on Gulangyu, are all threats. In a word, this is all a strategy to respond to Germany and Italy and make the United Kingdom and France hesitate.</p>
<p>From the above points of understanding, we can know that the two major international camps are intensifying their diplomatic struggle. The European situation is far from easing now. Whether it can ease in the future depends on the results of the diplomatic struggle; it also depends on whether the peace front can strengthen unity to curb the advance of the aggressors; it depends on whether a collective security system can be established; it depends on whether the British and French people can supervise their governments to change their "compromise" policy and adopt a firm anti-aggression policy.</p>

<p>(London) All the newspapers here printed the news of the Japanese landing in Gulangyu in large type, but without criticism. People in both political and business circles are fully aware of the seriousness of the situation, because if the Japanese army can implement its demands in Gulangyu without resistance, it will take the same action in other more important foreign settlements or concessions. Officials are still awaiting reports from the Xiamen Consul and the Navy, but have made it clear that any attempt by the Japanese to forcibly interfere with the administration of Gulangyu will not be tolerated. The Japanese sending Marines to land there to protect their national interests cannot be blamed, but other countries also enjoy the same rights. According to Reuters news, the British Cabinet is now keenly concerned about the interests of the Far East and may consider the situation in Gulangyu at its regular meeting on Wednesday. Members of the House of Commons China Committee will probably raise questions in the House of Commons and urge Britain to send sailors to land there to prevent the Japanese from monopolizing the right to garrison the concession. It is reported that the US Navy authorities are also preparing to land troops. (15th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>If Japan Takes Unusual Actions in Shanghai, Anglo-Japanese Relations Will Inevitably Lead to Unfortunate Results; British Under-Secretary of State Declares in the House of Commons: The Japanese Government Should Not Misunderstand</p>

After reviewing the situation, Foreign Under-Secretary Butler said that the British government has instructed British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie to protest against Japan's forcible interference with the Gulangyu Municipal Council, because the council was established in accordance with the agreements signed between the Chinese government and the treaty powers. Butler continued, if Japan takes the same action in the public concession in Shanghai, Anglo-Japanese relations will inevitably lead to unfortunate results. The Japanese government should not misunderstand this. Some members of parliament asked the government to guarantee that Japan's occupation of Gulangyu was only temporary. Butler replied that he was now awaiting intelligence from British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie.

<h3 id="e15">Major Losses for Japanese Forces in Northern Shanxi <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Recent military affairs on both Shanxi fronts have entered a stalemate. Strongholds in the triangle area and east of the Tongpu Railway remain under siege and surveillance by Chinese forces. The main force of the Japanese army in northern Shanxi, the 20th Division, has suffered heavy losses. Some regiments have only 700-800 men remaining. It is rumored that Division Commander Ushijima, having failed in his command, was reprimanded by Sugiyama and may be transferred to Tianjin or Beiping for some training duty. Most of the key points outside Anze and Fushan are controlled by the Chinese army, with the Japanese only defending the city gates. Since the beginning of the month, Japanese troops from Hongdong have launched eastward attacks in the area between Anze and Fushan, but after being attacked in separate groups by the Chinese army, they suffered heavy losses in the west. The northern section of the Baijin Highway is also beyond the Japanese army's ability to attack south. They are currently entrenched in several towns and villages such as Nanbei Guanwang and He, building fortifications and repairing roads to defend against Chinese attacks. The Jicwang Mountains on the west side of Tongpu and the north and south banks of the Fen River have intermittent skirmishes. The highways in Xinjiang, Jishan, Hejin, Wanquan, and Ronghe are constantly being sabotaged by the Chinese. In the Xinji area, the Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to divide and harass villages and towns in the southern passes of the Lüliang Mountains, but has so far been unsuccessful. North of Hejin, the eighty bends of Guzhen Xizhai Pass are important high ground controlling the Yumen Ferry. The Chinese army is currently besieging them. There have been no major changes at Tumen Heilong Pass in western Shanxi. In addition to continuing the siege, the Chinese army also frequently ambushes Japanese troops on the move. The area west of Zhaocheng, Huoxian, and the Fen River is currently the center of Japanese occupation in western Shanxi. More than 1,000 Japanese troops were added to Wan'an on the 8th, indicating that there will be a major battle in the area. The southern section of the Tongpu Railway has been repeatedly and extensively damaged by the Chinese army, making it extremely difficult for the Japanese to mobilize and transport supplies. At present, the Chinese have dismantled a total of 70-80 li of track, both north and south of Zhaocheng. Iron bridges such as those south of Huoxian City and at Xinzhi, south of Linfen, and at Zhaoqu Chaizhuang have all been destroyed. About 1,000 Japanese troops from Zhongyang Lishi Dawu area, reinforced by Fenyang, have a westward attack pattern. The key points near Pian Pass in northwestern Shanxi have been successively recovered by the Chinese army. The remaining Japanese troops have been driven into the city. The Japanese army in the Wutai area, transferred north from Taiyuan, numbers about 10,000 and are divided into several groups within the city. On the line from Dongzhi Town to Doucun, they began an eastward offensive on the 7th, invading Dongru Village Hengqiangwan. Japanese aircraft have also been unusually active in the area for several days. Last autumn, the Japanese mobilized 50,000 troops for a ten-pronged attack on Wutai, but ultimately suffered a disastrous defeat. There is no doubt that this renewed disturbance will be crushed by the Chinese. (14th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese military sources, the Eighth Route Army in Shanxi Province has reportedly captured Hekou northwest of Taiyuan. At the same time, Pian Pass in northwestern Shanxi is also under siege. Fierce fighting is also taking place in central and southern Shanxi. The Eighth Route Army there has completed the reorganization of self-defense forces and militia to deal with the newly arrived Japanese reinforcements. It is also reported that the Japanese army in Taiyuan has dispatched 7,000 troops to Wutai Mountain to conduct its so-called "mopping-up" operation again. (14th Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The newly appointed Chongqing Mayor He Guoguang told reporters today that after taking office, he will first start a plan to strengthen air raid preparedness and implement a procedure to reduce the city's population to below 200,000, so that residents can take shelter in air raid shelters during air raids. Fire lanes will also be added, and the construction of Chongqing's underground tunnel will be completed as soon as possible. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, according to officials of the "New Life Movement," after Japanese planes bombed Chongqing wildly, the number of workers participating in the New Life "Industry Camp" in the mountains near Chongqing suddenly increased. Before the Japanese air raids on Chongqing, workers said that the camp was too far from Chongqing and they did not want to join. But now, workers are deeply aware that places near Chongqing cannot avoid Japanese bombing, so they have resolutely gone to the camp's office to register. (15th Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to the Tianjin Yong Bao, the currency situation in Tianjin, caused by the disparity in value between legal tender and "United Reserve" currency, is affecting prices and people's livelihoods. Therefore, the North China authorities are currently drafting a plan to deal with this situation. It is rumored that the authorities intend to remove the Tianjin concession from the "United Reserve Zone," recall the "United Reserve" currency currently circulating in the concession, and allow legal tender to circulate within it. The authorities also plan to expand the types of goods subject to export controls, expand the current five million yuan foreign exchange fund, and buy and sell foreign exchange at an exchange rate of one yen to eight pence.

Currently, there are three aircraft flying, and two others have been damaged and are currently being repaired. According to Mr. Pang, the company's aircraft are sufficient for flying on China's western route, but it really wants to purchase several more aircraft to meet any unexpected needs.

<p>(Moscow) Sun Ke, President of the Chinese Legislative Yuan, recently held talks with the Soviet authorities here. It is said that he has now left for other destinations. The Soviet side seems to be very satisfied with the outcome of the talks. It is impossible to know what was discussed. Some believe that several Chinese financial experts have also arrived here to discuss loan issues. Regarding the various news about Sun Ke carried in Japanese newspapers, the Soviet side only stated that China and the Soviet Union are both independent nations and have absolute freedom to sign any agreements. Although it is not yet known whether an agreement has actually been signed, rumors spread by Japan that China's foreign policy must first seek Soviet consent are actually slandering China as a vassal of the Soviet Union, which can be described as extremely absurd. Although the Japanese side said that after Sun Ke came here, the Soviet Union would expand its assistance to China, Japan has not yet put forward any</p>

<p>(Warsaw) The people of Warsaw today felt greatly relieved because Mussolini, in his speech in Turin yesterday, stated that there was nothing at present to cause war, and became optimistic about the issues between Germany and Poland. It is pointed out that Poland has never given up hope that Mussolini would mediate to make Germany adopt a more moderate policy. Another good sign that could ease the situation is that the National Socialist Party reportedly planned to hold a demonstration in Danzig tonight and German newspapers have stopped anti-Polish propaganda. However, there are still one million Poles serving in the army, and a large number of the most elite troops are concentrated near Danzig. Yesterday, the Polish Minister of War left here for Paris, and it is believed that their trip is to discuss the plan to purchase French equipment and develop Poland's arms industry. (15th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Evening News recently published a telegram from its Berlin correspondent stating that, regarding the dispute between Germany and Poland, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is reportedly no longer acting as a mediator. Therefore, a serious incident may occur in the Free City of Danzig in the near future. "It is rumored that the city council will soon issue a declaration, stating on the one hand that it respects the interests held by the Polish nation in the city, and on the other hand, declaring that the city will be incorporated into Germany, and other borders will become German borders. If Poland interferes, it will be invading German borders. In this way, the mutual assistance agreement previously concluded between Poland and Britain and France, which can only be implemented when the country is threatened, cannot be invoked if the country attacks German borders. Regarding this level, German officials are deeply convinced that they can control the situation with certainty and are now further studying the issue of the Polish Corridor." (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Warsaw) According to Polish reports last night, more than 10,000 young Germans have arrived in Danzig in the past ten days, with the aim of participating in today's National Socialist Party demonstration. However, Polish officials said that they are convinced that no disturbances will occur, and said that the Polish side will not stop today's National Socialist Party demonstration in Danzig. It is rumored that a printing factory in Danzig is currently printing a large number of ballots, with the character "Yes" printed in large font and the character "No" printed in small font, perhaps in preparation for a future public vote.

<p>(Rome) Political figures here recently stated that Mussolini's speech in Turin yesterday has had a good reaction in various democracies. Newspapers have published telegrams from their correspondents stationed abroad, all stating that Mussolini's statement that "there are no problems in Europe at present that are enough to cause war" has been received with joy by all countries, especially in London. The Roman People's News wrote, "The desire for peace between Germany and Italy has been clearly expressed by Prime Minister Mussolini, thereby clarifying the international situation. Although Italy and Germany have confirmed that there are no problems in Europe at present that are enough to cause war, if war cannot be avoided after all, the responsibility for this rests clearly with the democracies. It must be known that the democracies' continued adherence to a stubborn attitude toward poor countries is enough to endanger the world's culture. Conversely, if they can be open and honest based on the minimum amount of justice, and address the current issues such as the city of Danzig, Germany's recovery of its former colonies, Gibraltar, Tunisia, and the Suez Canal, it would not be difficult to achieve a solution. Wouldn't it be good to ensure peace in Europe for the next fifty years? At this point, Italy and Germany have already expressed their desire for peace, and the United Kingdom and France should take action to adapt accordingly." (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Dictatorial Countries Reiterate Wishes, Hoping to Satisfy Demands for Territorial Expansion</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German Academy of Law held a meeting in Munich today to discuss colonial issues, and Italian representatives also participated. Minister Frank immediately delivered a speech, stating, "Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany are both fighting for the rights and space vital for survival. Whether in political issues or in colonial issues, they have formed an indestructible united front." Italian representative Merigazzi (who is a senior official in the African colonies) then explained Italy's colonial policy, stating, "We want to create a new culture in Africa that can serve as a model, and we do not want to promote false European culture or a mixed European-African culture in Africa." General Alb, Chairman of the German Colonial Society and Governor of the Province of Bavaria, finally delivered a speech, stating, "Germany is now using justice as a weapon to fight for land rights to ensure colonial interests, but to obtain such rights, it must still use force as its backing." (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) On the eve of the opening of the German Colonial Congress, German comments and newspapers have begun to promote the recovery of Germany's former colonies. The Axis powers will obviously help each other in order to obtain the rights they believe are vital for survival. This opinion can be seen in the first comments published by newspapers after Mussolini's speech in Turin yesterday. An editorial in the Mantags Post stated that Rome and Berlin's determination to satisfy their colonial demands has been clearly stated by representatives of both countries.

<p>(Milan) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently presided over the completion ceremony of the new building of the Fiat car factory here and delivered a speech to 50,000 workers, stating, "Our country desires peace. I made a clear statement in my speech in Turin yesterday. However, there are still several issues in Europe that remain unresolved. If this continues to drag on, all European countries will feel the danger, so we should seek a solution as soon as possible." (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Political figures here commented on the speech made by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Turin, saying that there are no problems in Europe at present that are enough to cause war. It can be seen that Italy has a restraining force in the German-Italian axis. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently told German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Milan that the dispute between Italy and France will not constitute a pretext for war, and that Germany and Poland should reach a friendly solution on the issue of the Free City of Danzig. It can be seen that the Axis countries will not resort to violent actions for some time, and the democracies may take this opportunity to conduct economic negotiations with them. However, it is worrisome that Italy and Germany may not ultimately give up the use of violent means. (14th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible figures here commented on the speech made by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Turin, saying that his tone was quite moderate and that his statement that Germany and Italy were committed to peace was quite satisfactory. As for the assertion that the democracies are being aggressive, the only goal of the guarantee measures advocated by Britain and France is to prevent aggression. If the Axis countries do not harbor aggressive ambitions, they will not be implemented. Moreover, this guarantee measure is open in nature, and any country can join it and has not excluded the Axis countries. Premier Daladier and British Prime Minister Chamberlain have repeatedly made declarations on this point. (14th Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Government circles here today believe that Mussolini's speech in Turin yesterday was still moderate. Some circles believe that Mussolini's moderate speech was the result of the understanding reached between Britain, France and Turkey last week. Observers speculate that this speech may lead to a peaceful resolution of the issues between France and Italy. (15th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German political circles warmly welcomed Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in Turin yesterday, which included the statement that there was no reason for a general war in Europe because the situation was not acute enough. They regarded it as British Prime Minister Chamberlain's approval of their position on the Danzig issue. According to the opinion of a political commentator, some issues must be resolved, but there is no need to use force to resolve them. However, the democracies have repeatedly issued declarations that they can use negotiations to change the status quo. How can this be proven to be in the democracies' favor? The people of Danzig have the rights of democracy and self-determination to do what they want. If others want to prevent the implementation of this right, then those who cause a devastating disaster are those who are arrogant. From now on, the Axis powers want to observe Britain's actions rather than its words to test Britain's peaceful intentions, because words are not enough to gain trust. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Observers here recently stated that the evolution of the European situation is considered unfavorable to the Axis powers by Germany and Italy, so they have made separate statements to allow their respective populations to regain confidence. Hitler's inspection of the western "Siegfried Line" and Mussolini's speech in Turin are clear evidence of this. The Monday Report stated that Hitler inspected the fortifications along the Rhine River while Mussolini was speaking in Turin, and these two facts have parallel significance. It is rumored that Hitler advanced the date of his inspection by twenty-four hours to coincide with the Turin speech. The location of Mussolini's speech, near the French border, is also quite noteworthy. (14th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Trier, Germany) Head of State Hitler inspected the "Siegfried Line" in the Aachen area yesterday, and continued to inspect the fortifications between Cologne and Trier this morning. (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This morning, newspapers here provided detailed commentary on Head of State Hitler's inspection of border defenses in the west yesterday. It is claimed that the German western fortifications in Aachen, near the Belgian border, are the most modern fortifications, even more solid than other points along the entire western line. The fortifications along the entire line are made of reinforced concrete and can be called an iron wall defending Germany's western border. Hitler personally inspected the west in order to know the detailed equipment there and ensure Germany's security. (15th Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>(Aachen, Germany) After arriving here, Head of State Hitler spent the entire day inspecting fortifications in the west, paying particular attention to the first and second lines of defense.

<p>(Paris) Polish Minister of War General Kasprzycki arrived here at 9:55 this morning. French Chief of Defense Staff General Gamelin and Polish Ambassador to France Lukasiewicz welcomed him at the station. The ambassador accompanied him to the embassy for rest. (15th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Warsaw) Minister of War General Kasprzycki set off for Paris this morning for an informal visit. It is generally said that this trip will be a meeting with French military leaders, and its significance is self-evident. Since the establishment of the mutual assistance agreement between the UK and Poland, the current alliance between France and Poland has been strengthened. General Kasprzycki's visit to France is the first direct meeting between the military authorities of the two countries after the strengthening of this alliance, and its importance can be known. The last meeting between the military authorities of France and Poland was in 1936, when French Chief of Staff General Gamelin visited Warsaw on August 12 of that year, and Commander-in-Chief of the Army Smigly-Rydz visited France in return on August 28 of the same year, and signed the Langpouy Agreement with the French authorities, whereby France loaned Poland a huge sum of 100 million Zlotys (equivalent to approximately 500 million francs).

<p>(New York) Martin, editor and founder of Time magazine, admits that events in Europe are changing so fast that even the predictions of prophets cannot keep up. Martin wrote a book last year called "Common Man Power," which included predictions for a 1996 "Stop Hitler" movement, the annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1943, the outcome of the Greek Revolution in 1940, the expansion of Italian power to the Balkans, reaching Greece via Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, and the conquest of Asian countries by the Communist Party in 1951. In his book, Martin also predicts events sixty years later, that Rogge (now a senator) will be the President of the United States, Queen Elizabeth (the current 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth) will ascend to the British throne, Queen Juliana will abdicate the Dutch throne, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will "still be as strong as ever." Regarding the predictions for German Head of State Hitler, Martin said that in 1943, Britain and France would defeat Hitler's expansion plan, causing Hitler to become mad. The Head of State may retire to his mountain residence and occasionally appear to the German people on radio transmissions. Martin anticipates Indian independence but still within the British sphere of influence. As for the conquest of Asia, absorbing Japan, China, and Korea to become an Asian Soviet Union, and the time to replace the Japanese organization in China, it will be after the end of the Russo-Japanese War in 1951. Martin said, "Then the Western powers will begin to encounter the fundamental results of the world, that is, the East and the West will be involved in the final war, which is a duel between individualists and collectivists. In the 1958 war, the combatants will be the American superman army. The people of the warring countries will not suffer any consumption or even be disturbed." (14th Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Soviet Premier and Foreign Minister Molotov today delivered the Soviet Union's response to the British proposals to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds. The document has been forwarded to London. Its contents have not yet been announced here. Seeds spoke with Molotov for half an hour today. It is reported that the conversation was quite amicable. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of forming an anti-aggression bloc, the Soviet government has delivered its reply to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir William Seeds. It is reported that the Soviet Union still insists on mutual guarantees, namely that after the Soviet Union provides guarantees to Britain, Britain must also provide guarantees to the Soviet Union. This is coupled with the fact that certain British cabinet members are still unwilling to sign a military alliance treaty with the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the Spanish government recently stated that if Britain and the Soviet Union were to sign a formal military alliance treaty, Spain would establish closer relations with the Axis powers. Certain British cabinet members are therefore even more vociferous in advocating a cautious approach. As for Britain's ultimate attitude, it will depend on how the situation in the Free City of Danzig develops. This much can be stated with certainty. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Political figures here recently declared that the Soviet Union has indeed decided to cooperate with Western European countries, but not at any cost. The Soviet Union has absolutely no intention of abandoning the idea of a military mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The new counter-proposal put forward by Britain was previously rejected once and is still not intended to be accepted. However, if Britain can accept the Soviet proposal to allow Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, or even Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland, to conclude a mutual assistance agreement, then the situation would be different. Furthermore, although Britain and France are taking joint action, based on the recent diplomatic negotiations, France seems to be more aligned with the Soviet viewpoint than Britain. The sudden dismissal of the former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, was due to his readily accepting British views. It can be seen that although the Soviet Union is now prepared to cooperate with Western European countries, it must do so based on the current balance of power in Europe and within the framework of a realistic policy structure. As for the plan previously proposed by the Soviet Union, the specific details can certainly be revised, but the key points must be accepted by the Western European countries. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government mouthpiece, *Izvestia*, today expressed approval of the British-Turkish agreement, saying that the British-Turkish mutual assistance agreement currently being prepared is a step towards establishing an effective peace front and is one of the only effective chains to prevent aggression. Turkey occupies an important strategic position and has long been coveted by aggressor nations. Turkey is also aware of this danger. This is why the British-Turkish negotiations have achieved satisfactory results. The newspaper continued, saying that it must be understood that Turkey's warnings to aggressor nations must be taken into account, as they are trying to prevent Turkey from joining the anti-aggression front of the great powers. In this regard, it is recalled that the German Foreign Office, without Turkey's request, hastily advised Turkey not to negotiate with democratic countries and hinted that if Turkey did so, there would be dire consequences. Turkish newspapers and public opinion recognized the greater good and gave it due censure, stating that Turkey could not tolerate foreign interference in its foreign policy. The Soviet Union always welcomes all efforts by countries to organize genuine national defense for pacifism. Therefore, the Soviet Union is satisfied with the steps taken by Turkey in adopting this policy. The recent consultations between the Turkish and Soviet governments have seen a coincidence of views on the current international situation and the need for the two countries to unite more closely for the sake of peace. This is proof of the solid friendship between the two countries. The newspaper concluded by saying that Soviet public opinion and all those who sincerely desire peace will view the British-Turkish agreement as a contribution to peace, and that the Soviet Union's commitment to maintaining peace remains unwavering.

According to current information, widespread disturbances occurred in Brno on May 1st, and it is reported that German soldiers and members of the National Socialist Party's protection units were forced to charge the crowd with fixed bayonets.

They are dissatisfied with President Hacha's servility in going to Berlin to congratulate Hitler, the Führer.

In addition, he is implementing a policy of brainwashing, preventing the general public from knowing about various major international events. However, the Czech nation is not deceived. News about international events is spread by word of mouth, from ten to a hundred, until the whole country knows. The German rulers cannot control their mouths. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>Snyder, a wealthy man from Miami and Chicago, Florida, in the United States, known as the "Iron Lung Man," suddenly suffered severe paralysis while traveling in China in 1937. Fortunately, he was able to survive thanks to an iron lung, which has been the case for one or two years. Although his condition has improved in recent years, he still cannot leave the iron lung for a moment. To speed up his recovery, he departed today for the world-famous grotto in Lourdes, France, where the Virgin Mary appeared, to "pray sincerely" in the hope of using the miraculous power of God to cure this persistent disease. When he departed, he used a specially made train car. Upon arriving in New York, he will take a mail ship to Le Havre, France, and then travel through Tours and Bordeaux to Lourdes. He is scheduled to return to New York next month on the 26th and return to his hometown of Chicago after visiting the World's Fair. He is accompanied by one doctor, five nurses, two "iron lung" experts, and a chauffeur, as he will be traveling in a specially made car in France. (Havas, 14th)</p>

These bombers will take off from the west of the city and be intercepted by fighter planes. Tonight, a blackout will be implemented in an area of 400 square miles. Transport riverboats have been mobilized to test the evacuation of residents. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Premier Kung's Opening Address at the Production Conference <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the government, recognizing the enormity of war expenditures and the scarcity of national resources, has promoted frugality on the one hand to reduce unnecessary consumption and encouraged production and resource development on the other to supplement resources. All domestic public and private production enterprises have been vigorously promoted and supported to reduce their difficulties, strengthen their capabilities, and increase their efficiency. Matters such as assisting the relocation of factories, organizing agricultural and industrial loans, and subsidizing production capital have been pursued with the greatest effort and courage. To ensure convenient operation and rapid results, in addition to the supervision and management by the relevant departments, new agencies such as the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee and the Industrial Cooperative Association have been established to engage in production work. However, although promotion has been vigorous, the effectiveness of the efforts still requires a detailed review to remedy shortcomings and achieve rational and smooth development. Therefore, the purpose of convening this conference is to "review past work and promote future production." Now, I would like to offer a few opinions on these two goals for your reference. First, the establishment of a production system. Regarding national economic construction, the late Premier has already given detailed instructions, which we should follow as guidelines and strive to implement. What we should strive for today is, on the one hand, to meet current needs and increase the production of various necessities to strengthen the war effort, and on the other hand, to follow the legacy of the late Premier and establish a long-term plan to lay the foundation for national reconstruction. Since the War of Resistance, the government has paid attention to three things: first, the formulation of regional economic plans; second, the coordination of state-owned enterprises and private enterprises; and third, the relief of the rural economy. Our country is vast and rich in resources, and large-scale production can be planned everywhere. However, the mutual coordination of the natural environment and production enterprises requires consideration of the strengths and weaknesses in each location. In the past, economic development was not able to proceed entirely according to plan, and corrections should be made in the future. The government has now considered the resources and transportation of the southwestern provinces and decided to select appropriate locations within Sichuan province as the first phase of industrial development, engaging in the exploitation of coal mines, petroleum, and coal gas, and has already established alcohol plants, power plants, chemical plants, etc. Plans are still underway for paper mills and sugar factories. The formulation of this type of regional economic plan is the main point in current economic construction. Under the principle of national livelihood, restricting private capital and preventing a few capitalists from monopolizing the market and controlling finance are necessary measures. Therefore, the government's economic construction plan follows the legacy of the late Premier. Heavy industry and defense industry are based on state ownership as a principle, while light industry is based on government-encouraged private ownership as a principle. Currently, the main means of transportation in the country have long been nationalized, and the larger-scale mining areas, especially those related to defense industry and heavy industry, have also been designated as state-owned mining areas. However, private enterprises must also be vigorously promoted and supported to achieve division of labor, cooperation, coordination, and progress. Therefore, the government has recently paid special attention to the revision of the Company Law, the encouragement of private enterprises, and issues such as cooperation between government and business. As for the relief of the rural economy, close attention was paid to it even before the war, such as promoting rural cooperation, agricultural experiments, and the establishment of the Agricultural Bank, which had already been actively underway. Since the outbreak of the war, the work of the Agricultural Bank has focused more on the southwestern provinces, such as establishing county cooperative treasuries, organizing agricultural warehouses, investing in farmland irrigation, and purchasing cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and food for transportation to the rear, which has made considerable progress. We should continue to work hard to achieve universal effectiveness. However, such plans, whether they are perfect or not, are of great importance to the future of the enterprise, and it is necessary to carefully review them based on social conditions and individual experience, and special attention should be paid to the following two points. (1) The choice of production type and nature. In general, production enterprises are mostly beneficial to the national economy, but the effectiveness varies among the urgency and priority. Therefore, the nature and type of production must be in line with the current practical needs. Recently, prices in various places have been rising repeatedly. The main reason is that supply and demand cannot be adjusted. People feel a lack of daily necessities, while luxury goods and consumables still flood the market. This is a very unreasonable phenomenon. In the future, not only should imports be required to be in line with needs, but domestic production enterprises should also strive to reduce the manufacture of consumables and luxury goods, concentrate all capital, and work hard to produce necessities, export trade goods, and defense industrial products. Among the necessities, special attention should be paid to increasing food production and promoting the textile industry. Although our country is known as an agricultural country, the amount of food imports is very large. Now that the occupied areas are expanding and import routes are interrupted, it is not enough to meet the urgent needs without striving to increase production in the interior. The textile industry has always been concentrated on the coast of North China. Now the clothing problems of the military and the people depend on the establishment of the inland textile industry. Export trade production is also very important at present. Since the War of Resistance, all the replenishment of foreign exchange funds, the replenishment of armaments, and the purchase of various necessities have been compensated by the export of local products, such as tung oil, tea, fur, and other items, which should be promoted and expanded. As for the construction of the defense industry, it is not only related to the future of the War of Resistance but also to the plan of national reconstruction, so it should be comprehensively planned and actively carried out. Now the southwestern and northwestern provinces are our base for the War of Resistance and where our national essence lies. The essence of the southeast has been destroyed. We must first succeed in building the southwestern and northwestern provinces before we can exert economic power as the basis for national revival and prosperity. Therefore, current economic construction should focus on the southwestern and northwestern provinces, considering the source of their raw materials, and striving to adapt to the state of supply and demand, to determine which place is suitable for which enterprise and when is suitable for which production, and comprehensively plan to achieve the most appropriate. Second, the promotion of production work. The success of an enterprise requires not only a detailed plan but also the effort to promote its work. Now that the War of Resistance is urgent, everything must be done promptly and quickly, with agile means, to achieve the greatest effect. The purpose of this production conference is to meet for production, not to meet for the sake of meeting. Therefore, all matters discussed and decided at the meeting must be implemented immediately to respond to the opportunity. The following points should also be noted regarding the promotion of work. (1) The improvement of the organization of production agencies. The self-organization of various production enterprises should strive to be sound, and the organizations should also coordinate and cooperate with each other. In the past, production agencies in various places often lacked close ties and presented a state of partiality. There were often several organizations in charge of the same enterprise, and there were also some enterprises that should be promoted but no one paid attention to. As a result, on the one hand, they overlapped and conflicted with each other, reducing production efficiency. On the other hand, due to the lack of capital and labor, the enterprises could not be fully developed. As for the internal organization of each agency, it is also large and complex, not only inflexible in operation but also unclear in the division of powers, resulting in friction between many people. This type of situation is likely to be found in government-run enterprises. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e43">Mysterious Plane Crashes, Intrudes Into Hong Kong, Flies Low Over Ships, Hong Kong Conducts Third Air Defense Exercise <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Several months ago, mysterious planes were repeatedly spotted flying over Hong Kong. Later, it was learned that this squadron of mysterious planes was Japanese warplanes. As a result, all Hong Kong residents were in an uproar, as if they were talking about a tiger. The Hong Kong government remained tight-lipped about the matter. Fortunately, no similar incidents occurred afterward, and people gradually forgot about it. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 pm on the 8th of this month, a squadron of mysterious planes, totaling three, was spotted over the airspace of Tai O. At that time, there was a British shallow-water warship patrolling the Tai O sea. The squadron of mysterious planes flew low over the ship, at a distance of no more than 800 meters, so the fuselage was clearly distinguishable. At the same time, the general public also saw that the tail of the squadron of mysterious planes was red and that there was a red emblem under the wings. Of course, it was undoubtedly a Japanese plane again. However, after the incident, the Hong Kong government remained silent. Hong Kong's air defense facilities are constantly being strengthened. The air defense authorities recently announced that starting from the 8th of this month, a third city-wide blackout will be held at any time within ten days. No prior notice will be given. After the air raid alarm is issued, all shops and residences in Hong Kong must turn off their lights. At that time, all air defense personnel and rescue teams will be mobilized for practice to test whether Hong Kong can cope with an air raid.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Hua Army Approaches Xu, Close to Battle with Japanese Forces at Yinping; Japanese and Puppet Flags Removed from Xu Station <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>A unit from Zhou Shi made contact with Japanese forces at Yinping, near Hanzhuang. The Japanese forces deployed seven armored vehicles, 500 artillerymen, and aircraft for support. The Hua army utilized the mountainous terrain and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese forces, eventually repelling them and continuing their advance, now approaching the north of Xu city.</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese Air Force has been attacking Xu Zhou to assist the main forces in assaulting Xu. To prepare, the Japanese forces in Xu Zhou have removed all Japanese and puppet flags from the station since the 6th of this month to reduce conspicuous targets. Large quantities of supplies stored at the Yu Zhou garrison are also being dispersed, with most being transported to Jinan. Various Japanese units in Xu Zhou have recently received a significant number of new recruits from the north, mostly from the Northeast, with very few Koreans. Many are young men aged fifteen or sixteen. The factories and recruitment offices set up by the Japanese in Xu Zhou were seen by the local population as a disguised form of conscription, and no one enlisted. Therefore, they had to change their recruitment efforts to the western routes, and have now recruited over six thousand men who are being transported north through Xu, forcibly incorporated into the puppet army of the Japanese forces in Xu Zhou.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Plots an Offense</p>
<p>They deeply resent the resistance organization of the people of Pei County. Previous so-called "mopping-up" operations were repeatedly repelled by the Hua army. Recently, the Japanese army dispatched 500 mechanical soldiers and again launched an offensive against Pei County. During the first month of last month, they launched three consecutive attacks. The first attack used the puppet army of Wang Xian's unit as the vanguard, and a fierce battle broke out with the regular Pei unit at Mengzhuang. The small contingent of Japanese and puppet forces were routed. In this battle, the Hua army killed over forty Japanese and puppet soldiers, and wounded more than twice that number. The next day, County Magistrate Feng led his team to attack the Japanese army at Erlangmiao, killing six and capturing one alive. They are currently confronting the Japanese army at Erlangmiao Dazhangzhai in the county, and sporadic clashes continue. As for the puppet army of Wang Xianchen's unit, of the original three detachments, only over a hundred men of Han Jiyao's detachment remain after being routed. Wang now seeks protection under the wing of the Japanese and dares not engage in further activities.</p>
<p>Longhai Railway Is Difficult to Repair</p>
<p>The eastern section of the Longhai Railway is currently being forcibly repaired by the Japanese army using conscripted laborers to rebuild the roadbed. However, most of the population near the railway has fled. The Japanese army is rushing to lay tracks day and night, but the previous damage inflicted by the Hua army was severe, making repairs difficult. At the easternmost point, repairs have only reached Xin'an Town. However, the bridges over the Grand Canal and the Si River were destroyed, and wooden structures are being used to temporarily fill the gaps and lay tracks, making it impossible for heavy trains to pass. The Japanese are using automobiles to transport supplies back and forth, but these are frequently attacked by guerrillas, so they dare not travel at night.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Tragic Boat Capsizing Disaster in Shantou Waters; Refugees Returning to Shantou from Jiaoshi Encounter Storm; Numerous Boat Sinkings and Drownings; Garrison Command Forbids Women and Children from Returning to Shantou <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>A communication from Shantou states that at noon on the 7th, a Japanese aircraft carrier from Naozhou sailed towards southern Fujian. Before leaving, it sent a plane to bomb Guanghua Wharf in Shantou, dropping four bombs. One bomb landed near a match factory, causing some damage to its machinery, and another landed in the river. After the Japanese warship left, another plane was sent to scout Chaozhou and Shantou. Refugees, hearing of the warship's departure, were relieved and rushed back to Shantou from various villages and Jiaoshi to inspect their shops for damage. In the past three days, two to three thousand people had fled to Jiaoshi across the sea. On the afternoon of the 7th, around 20,000 refugees gathered at the pier in front of the British Consulate, continuously hiring boats to cross the sea. Numerous barges crowded the sea, traveling back and forth. However, around 5 PM, due to the extremely hot weather of recent days, there was a drastic change in air currents. Dark clouds gathered, a whirlwind suddenly arose, sand and rocks flew, and sea waves rose high, sweeping across the boats. Then, a torrential rain began, adding to the wind's ferocity. At that time, there were over a hundred boats carrying refugees on the sea. The boatmen, unable to withstand the violent waves, were unable to maintain control, resulting in many boats sinking and numerous refugees drowning. Around 7 PM, the wind and rain began to subside. Various charitable organizations dispatched teams to the customs to recover bodies. According to those who returned to Shantou from Jiaoshi, they witnessed four ferries capsizing in the middle of the sea when the storm began. Due to the excessive wind and waves, no one dared to attempt a rescue, and over twenty passengers were drowned. According to a gentleman who was rescued from the disaster, his boat from Jiaoshi to Shantou had traveled halfway when a violent wind arose and waves rose over ten feet high. The boat was taking on water and was about to capsize. At this critical moment, he managed to bring the boat close to the British warship "So-and-So." The British sailors courageously came to their aid, rescuing the passengers of three or four small boats one by one onto the warship, totaling over seventy people, including thirty or forty women and children. The friendly foreign sailors also provided milk and biscuits to the thirsty and hungry, and led the women to their rooms to breastfeed their infants, providing attentive care. Around 7 PM, a foreign company from Neimen, an English merchant, dispatched an electric boat to transport the refugees safely ashore from the warship. After dusk, rescue teams from various charitable organizations dispatched numerous boats to search the sea, but the sea was dark and the search was difficult. The British warship turned on searchlights to illuminate the sea and sent sailors in boats to assist. However, when the boats capsized, the wind was strong and the waves were high, and the bodies that had fallen into the water had already drifted away. After the tragic boat capsizing, the people waiting for boats in Jiaoshi dared not cross the sea. After the wind and rain had subsided, the charitable organizations hired large ships and electric boats to transport them back to Shantou. Over a thousand people stayed overnight in Jiaoshi, housed and fed porridge by the Jiaoguang Middle School, Jiaoshi Elementary School, and the American church. They began to return to Shantou the next day. The Hai Cheng, Hai Yang, and Mei Zhong Mei ships in the harbor also contributed to the rescue, saving three or four hundred people onto their ships. It was also reported that four ferries from Dabu also capsized while carrying refugees back to Shantou, and the fate of the passengers is unknown. Many cargo ships also sank at Chaoyang Port. The number of casualties on this day is currently being investigated, and it is expected that many have lost their lives in the water. Natural disasters and man-made calamities have struck Chaozhou and Shantou in succession these past few days, which is truly unfortunate.</p>
<p>The Shantou Garrison Command, believing that the general population still harbors a sense of complacency and is reluctant to leave Shantou and its industries and move inland, issued an order on the 8th to all sentries to strictly prohibit women and children who had already fled the city from returning to Shantou, under penalty of detention. Additional police were dispatched to train stations and piers to enforce the order. In light of the boat capsizing tragedy, which was caused by ferries overloading passengers and charging exorbitant fares, it was stipulated that the fare for crossing the sea should be eight copper coins per person, and each sampan should only carry eight people, while larger ships should carry twenty people. Shantou shops now open at night and take refuge during the day. Japanese warships are now gathered near Shao'an, and bombing raids are being carried out on cities in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Overview of Studying Abroad in Various European Countries (1) Most Students Studied in France and the United States in the Past Ten Years; Future Plans Involve Both Restrictions and Incentives <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing) The situation of Chinese students studying abroad has been investigated in detail by the Ministry of Education. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>History of Studying Abroad</p>
<p>China officially began sending students abroad with the dispatch of young students to the United States in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign. In the first year of the Guangxu reign, four groups of 120 people were sent. Later, due to disagreements between the ambassador and the supervisor, the students were recalled in the seventh year of the Guangxu reign. It was not until the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign that thirteen government-sponsored students were sent to Japan. In the twenty-fourth year, Zhang Zhidong sent thirty students to Japan to study military affairs. Since then, students have been sent every year, and the number of self-funded students has also increased. At that time, there were as many as 15,000 students studying in Japan. In the thirty-first year, the Japanese side planned to promulgate regulations to restrict foreign students, which caused a great deal of opposition from the students, who returned home in large numbers, temporarily reducing the number of students. Later, the regulations were not promulgated, and many students returned to Japan to resume their studies. At this time, very few students were sent to study in the West, and the number of self-funded students was also small. In the thirty-third year, the Qing court declared its educational policy and sent education commissioners from various provinces to Japan for inspection, leading to a movement to promote education. With the return of the Boxer Indemnity from the United States, the Qinghua School was established, and the number of students studying in Europe and the United States gradually increased. In the fourteenth year of the Republic, Qinghua was reorganized into a university and stopped sending all students to the United States using previous American methods. Instead, a general examination method was adopted, setting an annual quota. According to statistics, the school had sent over 1,900 students one after another. Many students were also sent by various provinces. After the founding of the Republic, the number of students studying in Japan fluctuated. In the fourth year of the Republic, Japan forced the signing of the Twenty-One Demands, and students studying in Japan were motivated by righteous indignation and returned home in large numbers. In the thirteenth year of the Republic, China and Japan concluded the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement, establishing Gengzi Indemnity scholarship quotas, and the number of students studying in Japan increased year by year. Although the Ministry of Education decided to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement in the nineteenth year of the Republic, there were still increasing numbers of students going to Japan.</p>
<p>Among the European countries, France had the largest number of Chinese students. Especially after the First World War, the number of students participating in the Diligent Work-Frugal Study movement increased dramatically, reaching a peak of 1,600. Later, with the establishment of the Sino-French University in Lyon, it became convenient for students to study in France. In the fourteenth and fifteenth years of the Republic, the Soviet Union established Sun Yat-sen University, and the Guangdong government sent students to study in Russia at that time, which was later discontinued. In the twentieth year of the Republic, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees established annual quotas for government-funded students to study in the UK, who were selected through examinations. This has been done for six terms.</p>
<p>Management of Studying Abroad</p>
<p>For the management of overseas studies, two supervisors were assigned to the young students sent to the United States in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign. These were effectively the study abroad supervisors. For the dispatch of students to Japan, most of the initial management was entrusted to Japanese individuals. In the third year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education dispatched one supervisor, and each province dispatched one or several managers to manage the affairs of students studying in Japan. In the fourth year of the Republic, a supervisor was established to manage students studying in Europe, while the affairs of students studying in Russia were still handled by the embassy in Russia. A supervisor for students studying in the United States was established to manage the affairs of students studying in the United States. After the establishment of the National Government, the supervisor for students studying in Japan was retained until the outbreak of the War of Resistance, when it was temporarily abolished. The supervisors for students studying in Europe and America were discontinued.</p>
<p>Qualifications for Studying Abroad</p>
<p>Chinese students going abroad to study should be limited to those who cannot obtain domestic instruction and facilities and are needed by the country. Before the twenty-first year of the Republic, students studying abroad only needed to have a high school diploma or above. After the promulgation of regulations in the twenty-second year, qualifications were raised: "Government-funded students must meet one of the following qualifications: (1) Graduates of public or registered private vocational schools or higher education institutions at home and abroad, and have held technical positions related to their field of study for more than two years; (2) Graduates of public or registered private vocational schools or higher education institutions at home and abroad, who have continued to study their field of study for more than two years and have valuable specialized writings or other achievements; (3) Graduates of public or registered private universities or independent colleges at home and abroad, with excellent grades." "Self-funded students" must meet one of the following qualifications: (1) Graduates of public or registered private vocational schools or higher education institutions; (2) Graduates of public or registered private senior vocational schools, and have held domestic technical positions for more than two years.</p>
<p>Assessment of Studying Abroad</p>
<p>In recent years, the Ministry of Education has tightened the selection process for government-funded students studying abroad, and the subjects of study are mostly agreed upon in advance with the dispatching agencies. For self-funded students going abroad, in addition to raising qualifications, most provinces have scholarships to subsidize self-funded students with good grades. Students studying abroad must submit research results periodically and apply for registration to the Ministry of Education after returning home. All these regulations make the management of students studying abroad much stricter than before. The subjects of study for government-funded students are, in principle, practical subjects such as science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine. This principle has been followed for many years. The number of self-funded students studying practical subjects has also increased year by year.</p>
<p>Number of Students Studying Abroad</p>
<p>In the most recent ten years (years 18 to 27), there were a total of 7,545 people, of which 6,781 were self-funded and 764 were government-funded. The proportion of government-funded students to self-funded students is one-ninth. In terms of each year, the year with the most self-funded students was the 18th year (1,568), because the qualifications for studying abroad were relatively broad at that time, so many people went abroad. The year with the fewest was the 27th year (33), which was due to the restrictions on studying abroad during the war. The year with the most government-funded students was the 23rd year (141), because it was a period of construction, so a particularly large number of government-funded students were selected. The year with the fewest was the 27th year (26), which was also due to the restrictions on studying abroad. In terms of country, the United States had the most government-funded students (319), followed by the UK (220), and Italy, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands had the fewest. With the exception of Japan (before the war), the United States also had the most self-funded students (526), followed by France, and the Netherlands had the fewest. In the past ten years (from the 18th year to the 27th year), the number of students who received study abroad certificates was 597 in the UK (including 220 government-funded), 600 in Germany (82 government-funded), 706 in France (34 government-funded), 188 in Belgium (13 government-funded), 24 in Italy (2 government-funded), 40 in Sweden and Switzerland (2 government-funded), 25 in Austria (self-funded), 6 in Denmark (2 government-funded), 3 in the Netherlands (2 government-funded), 1,845 in the United States (319 government-funded), 14 in Canada (self-funded), 3,483 in Japan (84 government-funded), 10 in Russia (self-funded), 3 in India (self-funded), 12 in the Philippines (self-funded), and 16 in other countries (self-funded). In total, there were 7,545 people in the past ten years, including 764 government-funded and 6,781 self-funded.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Sino-American Cultural Association Hong Kong Branch Established; Madame Sun Yat-sen Appointed Honorary President <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Hong Kong) The Sino-American Cultural Association Hong Kong Branch held its inaugural meeting recently at the Kong Sheng Hall on the second floor of the Exchange. Attendees included former Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting, Sir Zhou Shoushen, and American figures such as Citibank General Manager Biding and Wilson, totaling more than fifty people. The atmosphere in the meeting hall was extremely harmonious. Before the meeting began, everyone exchanged views in a cheerful manner. After Chairman Zhou Shoushen briefly announced the opening of the meeting, American Diasgen reported on the preparatory process, stating that the Sino-American Cultural Association was established in Chongqing in February of this year, with the aim of promoting Sino-American cultural relations and enhancing friendship between the two countries. A similar organization also existed in Shanghai. Recently, Sino-American figures in Hong Kong also felt the need to organize a similar group. Based on the principles of the Chongqing General Association, the Hong Kong Branch was established. It is hoped that Sino-American figures in Hong Kong will work together towards common goals, common interests, and common efforts to achieve success.

In the second set, Gongnü Middle School replaced Wang Zuyi with Yang Wenhuan, but Adi Snow continued their momentum, leading remotely with a score of 8-1. Gongnü Middle School then replaced Zhang Qixia with Tu Yueyuan, but there was still no improvement, and they fell into a hopeless situation with a score of 4-14. At this critical moment, Gongnü Middle School suddenly rallied their spirits, calmly fought back, and scored twelve consecutive points in one breath, tying the score at 16-14 and recovering a set. Adi Snow's morale was already declining in the third set, and they became obviously flustered. Gongnü Middle School took an absolute advantage with a score of 10-3, but after a slight oversight, they lost six consecutive points, leading by only one point. But Adi Snow failed again, and eventually lost again with a score of 11-15. As a result, Gongnü Middle School defeated Adi Snow by a score of 2-1, winning the championship of this division.

<h3 id="e62">Balanced Supply and Demand in Financial Cash Market <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for raw gold continued its meaningless gyrations, and prices were quite sluggish, remaining steady around 2,126 yuan. However, a certain gold shop continued to purchase actively on behalf of local banks, and securities firms and a certain bank also followed suit slightly. However, a certain gold shop, which had aggressively bought on behalf of South China banks in the past few days, suddenly started selling, and a certain silver shop also released holdings on behalf of wealthy bulls. Other silver shops also sold slightly, resulting in a balance between supply and demand, with little change. However, the result was ultimately a 2-yuan increase due to purchases by a certain money exchange. Trading was mediocre, with only over 700 taels transacted. Silver jewelry was marked up by one yuan. The prices of Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Barely at Two Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, although a certain gold shop purchased aggressively, the market remained stable due to ample supply from another gold shop and a certain silver shop. The opening price was 2,125 yuan per bar (ten taels), with no advantage or disadvantage compared to the end of last week. After opening, the market rose slightly as sellers' willingness to supply waned. A certain gold shop bought a total of 100 taels from a silver shop and other dealers, at an average price of 26 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops traded 50 taels among themselves at the same price. Later, a securities firm bought 50 taels from a silver shop at 27 yuan. After this, gold shops began selling again, and the market leveled off slightly. A certain gold shop bought 100 taels from other dealers at 26 yuan. The Russian bank also bought 50 taels from a gold shop at 25 yuan. The silver shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange at 25.5 yuan. Later, the silver shop sold another 50 taels to a money exchange at 25 yuan. Afterwards, a certain money exchange still had a buying interest, but no deals were made because sellers were waiting, so the midday closing price was still 25 yuan. Trading was even sparser in the afternoon, but a certain money exchange continued to show buying interest, and the market price rose slightly again. It first bought 50 taels from a gold shop at 26 yuan, and then another 50 taels from a gold shop at 27 yuan. By evening, the closing price was 2,127 yuan, resulting in a 1-yuan increase compared to the end of last week. The total fluctuation for the day was only two yuan. The current selling price of gold at cash shops is 2,130 yuan, and the buying price is 2,125 yuan. The current standard gold price is listed about 50 yuan lower than the posted price, but there were no deals made.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Marked Up by One Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of jewelry from silver shops remained unchanged. However, around 4 PM, as the trend for raw gold became quite stable, the price was marked up by one yuan, with Datong offering 216 yuan and Xintong offering 214 yuan, with a buying price of 208 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remains Stable</p>
<p>The buying price of Chinese cash at the Central Bank remained at 1,212.3 yuan. The posted price of Customs gold also remained stable at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207.2 yuan. This was due to the London telegraph of the 13th, which reported that the price of British pure gold remained stable at £7 8s 5.5d per ounce.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Aggressive Forward Exchange Purchases with Favorable Rates <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday remained rigid in the spot market. Although the Bank of England (on behalf of Tianjin banks and Japanese banks) and foreign firms competed to buy, the market price remained unchanged as foreign banks continued to supply. However, there was some change in the futures market. It once tightened due to aggressive buying with favorable rates, with July dropping to 15.75 yuan. Later, Hong Kong telegrams and Chinese banks took advantage of the high price to sell, and arbitrageurs also became active, causing a slight pullback and gradually narrowing the swap rates. Currently, the daily difference is: spot British exchange at 8.25 pence, this month at 8.12875 pence, June at 8.1875 pence, July at 8.125 pence, August at 8.0625 pence; spot US exchange at 16.0625 yuan, this month at 16 yuan and 16.03125 yuan paired, June at 15.9375 weak, July at 15.8125, August at 15.6875. From spot to August, the British exchange difference narrowed by 1.875 pence, and the US exchange weakened by 0.375. According to a certain gentleman from a Chinese bank, based on three and a half months (excluding commissions), the monthly interest rate is about 6%. Current futures trading is still active. The Hong Kong exchange rate remained stable due to equal supply and demand.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London telegraphs showed both near and far prices stable, the New York silver price remained unchanged, and London raw gold also tended to stabilize. The exchange rates for British versus US, versus Shanghai, and versus French were all stable. The US versus British exchange rates were slightly at 0.0625, and the rates for Shanghai and French remained unchanged. The Central Bank's posted rates for various exchanges remained the same. The opening selling prices for spot exchange rates at banks were 8.25 pence for British exchange and 16.0625 yuan for US exchange, with no change compared to the previous close. Although there were favorable rates (on behalf of Tianjin banks) and foreign firms competing to buy after opening, there was little change as foreign banks were quite willing to supply. A certain favorable rate and foreign firm successively bought HSBC and Maijiali spot British gold at 8.25 pence, and also bought a certain bank’s spot US exchange from Maijiali for 16.0625 yuan. HSBC’s posted rates remained unchanged, and there was no increase or decrease announced for the silver balancing tax, which remained at 5.25%. After this, favorable rates frequently bought futures for both British and US gold, briefly tightening the market. However, Chinese and foreign banks competed to supply, and Hong Kong telegrams also slightly sold, in addition to arbitrageurs who were also active. A Dutch bank sold British gold for this month at 8.2875 pence to a favorable rate, and then an overseas Chinese bank also sold US exchange for this month to a favorable rate at 16.03125 yuan. Later, Hong Kong telegrams and Chinese banks in Shanghai and Guangdong successively sold US exchange for June to a favorable rate at 15.9375 yuan, and US exchange for August at 15.6875 yuan. Near midday, Chinese banks traded spot Hong Kong exchange at 55.5 yuan, once weakening to 55.375 yuan, but recovering to 55.5 yuan at midday close. The bank's selling prices for spot exchange rates at midday close for both British and US exchange rates were unchanged from the morning opening.</p>
<p>Although foreign firms and Chinese merchants bought in the afternoon market, the situation was difficult to change as sellers were quite willing to supply. Foreign firms bought spot British gold from Maijiali and East Asia at 8.25 pence, and foreign banks traded spot US exchange among themselves for 16.0625 yuan. The Russian Chinese bank also traded US exchange for June at 15.9375 yuan. Later, Chinese speculators bought British gold for July from Huayi at 8.125 pence. After entering, Anda and Holland frequently sold spot Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 55.5 yuan, and the situation was also flat. The bank's selling prices for spot exchange rates at the evening close were 8.25 pence for British exchange, 16.0625 yuan for US exchange, and 55.5 yuan for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, there was no change in the British, US, and Hong Kong exchange rates compared to the midday close on the end of last week. Futures rates tightened slightly.</p>

<p>The yarn market is in a calm state. Sales to South China, Hong Kong, Yunnan, Shantou, and other regions are still not weak, so the market situation is peaceful. However, because the floating speculators generally believe that the yarn price is hovering at a high peak, and the selling price of Japanese yarn has weakened and continued to decline, the market stabilizes. However, operators and those with sufficient strength continue to scour the market. In the afternoon, the market calmed down slightly as factories resumed offerings, and the state of the market did not change much from the morning.</p>
<p>As for the current yarn situation, the market opened in the early morning, and the market situation did not change much. The momentum was stable, and some were slightly less willing to support prices due to the bad environment. The opening price fell by 1.5 yuan, and the single price of 20-count Double Horse Inn yarn was 422.5 yuan. The same industry traded 10 bales, but the sales of existing yarn were not prosperous. The selling price was lower than that of inn yarn. The opening price was 431 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan. There were few eaters, but Yunnan banks purchased the most 20-count coarse yarn. The demand for 20-count yarn decreased. Hong Kong and Shantou banks mostly purchased 32-count yarn. As a result, 20-count yarn fell again by 2 yuan to 429 yuan. The afternoon opening market was normal and unchanged. It was found that 1,955 bales were traded in the morning and 595 bales in the afternoon, totaling 2,550 bales. The price of 20-count Tiannv Double Horse yarn fell by about 1 yuan. The other items were largely unchanged from the previous day. Factory Shenxin No. 9 offered 2,380 bales of 20-count tickets with the Horse brand, priced at 410 yuan (all cash transactions). The deposit for the June-July term was 40 yuan per bale. Xinsheng Factory offered 200 bales of 20-count yarn with the Gold brand, priced at 405 yuan for the June-July term. Today, 300 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 1,330 pieces were shipped to Shantou, and 200 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. The amount of purchases from each bank is listed on the left:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market continued to decline because demand in various regions was weak. According to the market, the yarn and cloth market prices in Qingdao and Tianjin were weak and weaker than in Shanghai. As a result, business decreased, and the market was unstable. The price of 20-count Yueqin yarn was 362 yuan, which was 8 yuan lower than the price on Saturday.</p>

<p>As for foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market turned firm yesterday. At the beginning of trading, the market price rose due to good news from Liverpool and India. Then, some industry players settled prices, and it was rumored that Washington and Spain were negotiating to purchase cotton and wheat on credit. Therefore, the industry was quite optimistic. There was no confirmed news about the government's loan cotton release. Spot goods in the market were extremely tight. As a result, the price of American cotton increased by 7 to 12 points. Indian cotton increased sharply by 3 rupees. The Egyptian market was closed, and the price was predicted to increase by 10 points. Calculated in Legal Tender, the price of cotton all increased, with American and Brazilian cotton each increasing by 0.8 yuan per dan, Indian cotton increasing by 1.2 yuan, and Egyptian cotton increasing by 0.9 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai was very quiet because the price of foreign cotton was too high. However, many goods have arrived at various factories in recent days, which is also why the factories' willingness to purchase has weakened slightly. Industry players have also become quiet. It is heard that the security deposit for industry orders of foreign cotton will increase by 10%, calculated as 30%. Therefore, industry transactions in the future are expected to be affected. The cotton cloth prices converted to factory delivery prices yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>The arrival of a large number of Indian cotton in Shanghai has been reported previously. The BaromBelhavaea of the British Company, loaded with 33,000 pieces of Indian cotton, arrived at Wusongkou yesterday afternoon. Because there was no space on the pontoons in the inner wharves of the Huangpu River, the vessel anchored outside the mouth, and it can be imported today. In addition, the irregular Himalaya of the Italian Postal Steamship Company also brought 7,019 pieces of cotton from Karachi, India (phonetic translation). It is heard that the above cotton was handled by Japanese merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Piece Goods Sales Are Erratic; Trading on This Street Is Still Good <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The domestic cloth market is sluggish, and sales are barely fluctuating. This is because sales to customers are erratic. Shantou has suffered repeated bombings, and the rise in cloth sales was abruptly stopped. Yesterday, there was a telegram with a message to stop loading goods. However, the transfer of goods to Sichuan and Yunnan via the coastal defense is still frequently shipped. Recently, purchases have weakened. Wenzhou merchants purchased small amounts of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and twill cloth in batches of 50 or 60. The purchase by Xinghua, Taizhou, and Dongtai in northern Jiangsu is more active, with 30-odd packages of fine cloth, coarse cloth, and other fabrics being sold. Nearly 3,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, linen gauze, printed satin, and patterned cloth were sold. The purchase from the occupied areas of Bengbu and Wuhu is the most active, with the majority purchasing Japanese-made cloth. The products of Chinese factories are mostly mixed twill and colored cloth, totaling more than 3,000 bolts. Merchants from Nanjing purchased light-colored fabrics such as poplin, striped bleached cloth, linen gauze, and bleached twill, totaling more than 1,000 bolts. Wholesale transactions on this street are still good.</p>
<p>The prices of Dong cloth, white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill are stable. The morning opening price rose slightly by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, but the market showed signs of fatigue later in the day. The current price of spot Dragon Head fine cloth is still 13.95 yuan, and the future price is 14.05 yuan. Trading on this street is still lively, with over 800 more pieces being traded, because the industry's thinking remains stable.</p>
<p>Exports today include 80 pieces of piece goods shipped to Yantai, 60 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 300 pieces shipped to Shantou, 110 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, and 58 pieces shipped to Wenzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Paris Cloth Sales Are Strong <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>With the weather gradually warming up, both Chinese and Western clothing are being made in a timely manner, resulting in a sharp increase in sales and strong market prospects. Wholesale sales are also increasing day by day. There is also strong demand for woolen goods, foreign goods, silk and satin shops, and Western-style tailoring shops. The goods that were previously imported have mostly been sold out one after another. The standard market atmosphere is becoming firmer. The Lixing brand is even more popular. It is said that no more goods will arrive. Yesterday, the price for a whole box was 4.325 yuan, and the price for a single bolt was 4.4 yuan. The price for a small cut was an additional 0.1 yuan. The price for the Yongfeng Xiangtesheng brand was 4.2 yuan. The price for artificial wool Paris cloth was 3.75 yuan. The wholesale price for British-made first-class Paris cloth was 7.25 yuan, the second-class price was 6.6 yuan, and the price for Yihua Shen's first-class product was 5 yuan, the second-class price was 4.45 yuan, and the wholesale price for Hongsheng's single-width cloth was 2.25 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Silk and Tea: Yokohama Silk Prices Rise Again <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The New York market was closed yesterday. The Yokohama silk market rose sharply again. The spot price was 1,293 yuan, up 28 yuan. The forward price was 1,187 yuan, up 23 yuan. Judging from the sentiment of the Eastern market and various conditions, the Yokohama spot price has a possible jump to 1,300 yuan. Some silk merchants in Shanghai even believe that it can rise to 1,500 yuan. There were no transactions in the Shanghai silk market with the UK and the US, but there were frequent telegrams from Lyon. The Da Changren Company and others imported more than 50 dan of 20/22 grades of white factory silk, priced at 1,810-1,820 yuan.</p>
<p>In recent months, the Chinese and foreign silk markets have been on a path of continuous appreciation. The rising trend has often taken a curved path. Every excessive increase is followed by a period of decline, but the second wave of price increases will inevitably surpass the previous record. The chairman of the London Silk Association recently pointed out that the reason for the continuous rise in the world silk market is that Japan intends to take advantage of the difficult situation of Chinese silk and monopolize the market. However, this is only a one-sided view. Due to the impact of the war, Japanese silk has followed other industries (except the arms industry) in withering and reducing its production. In addition, the propertied classes of Japan fear the instability of the Japanese yen and hoard goods, which is also an important factor. Under these circumstances, silk merchants in Shanghai can only seize the best opportunity and do their best to promote foreign sales.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Securities: Bullish Positions Are Unstable; Bond Prices Fall Again <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>There was a significant change in the securities gray market yesterday. Cracks have appeared in the bullish positions. In addition, with the opening of "Huaxing" Bank and the unrest in the local situation, government bonds have suffered, so it is impossible to raise their prices. However, the great decline is not yet imminent. There are not a few who take advantage of small opportunities to short sell. Throughout yesterday, the initial opening was due to some people being very optimistic about the market price. No. 18 Datong, Tongkang, Shuntai, and Yongkang all bought, while Xingyuan, Zhenkang, Hongkang, and Defu all sold, so the price gradually weakened. No. 20 once bought in the middle, and the market price temporarily stabilized. But because Lianhe continued to sell, the price fell again. Type A bonds have fallen by 1 yuan. At the close, they rose slightly again. The trend was slightly more stable in the afternoon. Datong, Sankai, Wukang, and No. 41 bought, while Songmao, Dayu, Lemao, and Yongfeng No. 38 sold. The market price was weak and recovered, but was still below the morning closing price. The full-day market price resulted in a decrease of 0.55 to 0.85 yuan. The total transaction volume was around one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>In the stock market, 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 7.35 yuan, which was 0.15 yuan higher than before.</p>
<p>The Public Association reported that there were not many transactions yesterday. In the morning, all of the transactions were for the delivery of extremely large spot transactions from the previous week, so the transaction volume on that day was only enough to offset the tail number of previous transactions. However, the market atmosphere was quite good. Reclamation shares and Jardine shares had good demand. Shanghai Yarn Factory shares were weak, with buyers only offering 112 yuan. The selling price of Ruirong shares was 7.885 yuan. The buying price for water stock was as high as 645 yuan, but sellers continued to hold back, waiting for higher prices. There was active trading in electricity preferred shares, and there were large transactions at a price of 127 yuan. The trend of corporate bonds was weak, with many sellers. The rubber market was firm, but there was very little activity because operators were waiting for the results of tomorrow's Rubber Production Restriction Committee meeting. The price of Rubber Trust shares was 4.2 yuan, and the price of Yingzhaohua shares was 15.2 yuan. Demand for the above two types of shares was very strong.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Flour Sales to Tianjin Stalled; Inexhaustible Supply of Wheat <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Flour: The current flour market is as flat as usual. Although it is the beginning of the week, there is no improvement in customer sales. It has been ten days since the sales of northern banks were active. The reason is that the opening of Huaxing Bank in Tianjin has caused the local flour price to fall by as much as 0.3 yuan. Most grain merchants do not know how this happened, and all are wary and dare not transport goods arbitrarily. In order to maintain costs, the factories also know that customer sales are difficult to develop for the time being, so there is no need to make concessions for the time being. The second-grade flour factory still has a quota of 4.55 yuan. However, there are return goods that are cheaper by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, which cannot be regarded as the official market price. Among the 30,000-odd packages traded in the unified market, all were small batches sold by this street and the interior. The customer's sales were only small batches put together.</p>
<p>Wheat: The supply of wheat yesterday and the day before yesterday was continuous, but the quantity was not large. Most of them were goods from the Changshu-Wuxi area of ​​Jiangbei. Recently, because the foreign wheat raw materials of various flour mills are still sufficient, the demand for local wheat is relatively small. All scattered sellers to the factory are being priced down for acquisition. It is said that the selling price is just over 6 yuan. However, Japanese merchants have been purchasing at a price of 6.3-6.4 yuan. The number of transactions is 2,000 to 3,000 packages per day, but there has been no official market.</p>
<p>Exports: 4,000 packages of flour were shipped to Tianjin and 31,000 packages were shipped to Shantou on the 16th. Also on that day, 6,000 packages of bran and 250 packages of soybeans were shipped to Shantou, and 500 packages of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Short-Grain Rice Market Still Present Under the Table; Regular Short-Grain Rice at 17.00 Yuan <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of different groups of short-grain rice in Dujiang included 4 from the Nangang group, wheel packages, Sudong and other groups came to 3,600-3,700 packages. The source is gradually being dredged, and it is heard that there is no longer a border closure in Wuhu, so people are discouraged and customer trading slacks off, and the market fell a little. The black market for short-grain rice has also seen a slight decline, but it is still difficult to eliminate completely. It is heard that regular short-grain rice is at 17 yuan, and Sudong and other short-grain rice are at 16.3-17 yuan, Tijing is at 16.6-17 yuan, and early river-bottom rice is at 15.6-17 yuan. However, there has been no trading of high-quality thin rice. Shangxi Yangjian is at 16.2-3 yuan. In short, since the association and the evaluation committee have repeatedly and strictly enforced regulations, there is inevitably a slight concern, and the black market has disappeared a little. Only glutinous rice is still lacking in fluctuations.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Customers Are Arriving, and Prices Drop Again by 0.2-0.3 Yuan; Foreign Rice Set to Become a Batch <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The supply of customer long-grain rice is continuous and has not been interrupted. Yesterday, two more batches arrived from the Yangtze River, and both vendors and hoarding households sold off their stocks. With two shipments mainly consisting of stock, the market plunged by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The price of high-quality goods also fell slightly. More than 5,000 packages were sold in the overall market, mainly in this street. The Wuxian rice in the general market opened at 14 yuan, and high-quality goods are still unwilling to sell cheaply. High-quality Wuxian rice must be 14.4-5 yuan, Nanjing Xian rice is 14.5-6 yuan, and the selling price of coarse rice varies. According to news from Anhui, the new certificate in Wuhu has not yet been implemented, and the transport certificates that are currently allowed to be exported are still those issued previously. The total amount is about 40,000-50,000 packages.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has been stimulated by the rise in customer long-grain rice in recent days. Yesterday, Saigon rice had already been called up to 19.5 yuan, only half a yuan away from the price of 20 yuan in foreign telegraphs. If there can be special measures on freight and taxes, it can be planned. Therefore, it is rumored in the market that a certain foreign firm has already accepted a batch of orders, but both the grain merchant and the foreign firm have not yet officially confirmed it.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Oil Cakes: The Oil Market Settles, Bean Cake Prices Rise Slightly <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Raw Bean Oil: The market price has gradually declined from its peak, with a decrease of about three to four yuan, providing some relief to the general public. However, the market conditions have recently been overshadowed by negative sentiment, causing uncertainty among people. Prices have generally risen more than they have fallen. Yesterday, the market sales were still active, and the market trend temporarily settled. The total volume of transactions included 150 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, priced at 29 yuan; 200 pieces of Yantai Dalian bean oil, priced at 28 yuan; 20 pieces of Lianyungang oil, priced at 36 yuan; and 23 pieces of large barrel oil, priced at 35 yuan and 8 jiao. Jiaozhou bean oil, 100 pieces, was priced at 27 yuan and 5 jiao to 2 jiao. Dalian barrel oil, 550 barrels, was priced at 38 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean Cake Spot and Futures Market: Since the decline began last Thursday, trading has not weakened at all. Yesterday, the market uniformly rose slightly. Transactions included 1,000 pieces of Yuanji spot cakes, priced at 2 yuan, 8 jiao, and 5 fen; 2,000 pieces of assorted brand cakes, priced at 2 yuan, 8 jiao, and 3 fen. For June delivery, 8,000 pieces of Yuanji cakes were priced at 3 yuan, 0 jiao, 1 fen and a half and 3 yuan. For June delivery, 3,000 pieces of mixed brand cakes were priced at 2 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen and a half, and 2 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen and 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Sugar Market: Dutch White Sugar Drops by 3-5 Jiao <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a softening of Dutch sugar prices. According to reports, the price per dan for June was Dutch 5.78, for July-August 5.76, and for September-October 5.17. Therefore, the guild's quotation continued to ease slightly. Spot prices fell by a small jiao, with No. 24 coarse white sugar at the company's warehouse priced at 27 yuan and 5 jiao, and at other warehouses at 27 yuan and 3 jiao. Goods from the customs warehouse were relatively cheaper, with 500 bags transacted at 19 yuan and 2 jiao. Dutch white sugar, after being held for a long time, also saw a decline. Spot prices fell by 3 jiao to 18 yuan and 7 jiao, while transit goods suddenly fell by a small 5 jiao to 13 yuan, with 100 bags transacted. Taikoo refined white sugar fell by a small jiao, with the Western warehouse "♡" mark priced at 27 yuan and 1 jiao, with 200 bags released. The "◇" mark was at 26 yuan and 9 jiao, the "△" mark at 26 yuan and 7 jiao, the "□" mark at 26 yuan and a half, and the "○" mark at 26 yuan and 4 jiao. Military red sugar was at 19 yuan.

<h3 id="e78">North-South Goods: Rice Prices Soar Excessively <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Locust flower rice, due to the war in northern Jiangsu and the intentional release of the Yellow River, has had its supply almost completely cut off. Even the small amount that arrives is as rare as morning stars, causing prices to rise unexpectedly. The current market price for high-quality goods has reached as high as 43-44 yuan, but there is still no supply to meet the demand. Future goods may set new records.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Coal: Indian Coal Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Three ships carrying a total of more than 21,000 tons of Indian coal have arrived one after another. Today's imports include 6,080 tons of coal on the Ingola, managed by Jardine Matheson, which is docked at floating dock numbers 22 and 23 for unloading. In addition, the Harberton, carrying 7,600 tons of coal, is berthed at floating dock numbers 31 and 32 for transshipment. Furthermore, the Alice Moller, also managed by Jardine Matheson, carrying 7,617 tons of coal, is also scheduled to arrive today. Because there is no available dock or floating dock space in the Huangpu River, it is temporarily anchored at the Wusongkou, and is scheduled to enter port tomorrow, the 17th.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Hardware: Local Factory Nails See Brisk Spot Sales, Weak Futures <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Lead and Iron Sales Remain Active</p>
<p>Local Factory Nails: Due to the Tianjin gang's efforts to procure them, it is estimated that they have purchased more than 30,000 barrels in the past two weeks, causing spot prices in this area to temporarily rise to 19 yuan and 5 jiao. However, futures prices for June (18 yuan), July (17 yuan and 5 jiao), and August (17 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen) are all lower than previous market prices. This is because the Tianjin gang's purchases have recently become sluggish, and other gangs such as Qingdao and Yantai have also reduced their activity, resulting in a more stable market.</p>
<p>Lead and Iron: Recently, the market supply of new lead and iron is limited. However, with no new goods arriving, market sentiment is very strong. Customers from other areas and local factories are frequently increasing their purchases, creating an imbalance between supply and demand in the market. The market price has risen as high as 50 yuan per box. Although sales prices of 46-47 yuan are sometimes heard, they are all previous sell-offs, and with no new overseas goods being determined, holders are unwilling to sell lightly.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Tensions Gradually Rise in the Shanghai Concessions, British Warships to Sail North, British Admiral Has Gone to Xiamen and Will Come to Shanghai, Tokyo Telegram Says Final Decision Made <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 15th: British Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, Admiral Noble, departed this morning on the cruiser HMS Birmingham for Xiamen, and will personally investigate the situation in the Gulangyu Public Concession, which was occupied by Japanese forces last week. Afterwards, Noble will proceed to Fuzhou and Shanghai. Reuters, London, 15th: British Foreign Secretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today (15th), in response to a question from Labour MP Noel-Baker, that if the Japanese take the same action in the Shanghai Public Concession as they did in Gulangyu, the British-Japanese relations will inevitably have unfortunate consequences. The Japanese government cannot easily misunderstand this.</p>
<p>Three British Warships Continue North</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Hong Kong, 15th: Since the news spread that the Japanese internal circle has decided to take action in Shanghai, British warships stationed in Hong Kong have been ordered to sail north, attracting great attention here. British Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, Admiral Noble, has already embarked on the HMS Birmingham to Xiamen this morning for a "routine trip." According to reports, the ship has a maximum speed and only requires 24 hours to travel from Xiamen to Shanghai. In addition, there are three cruisers sailing north.</p>
<p>Tokyo Adopts a Strong Stance</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th: Yomiuri Shimbun reports that since Britain and the United States have taken a stubborn attitude, Foreign Minister Arita has made a final decision to adopt a fundamental and strong stance to resolve the Shanghai Public Concession dispute. In this regard, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, who returned here for consultations with Arita, will hold an important meeting this afternoon. Yomiuri Shimbun's editorial also stated that the Japanese government now holds a firm view that the Public Concession dispute cannot be resolved by superficial methods, and feels the need to perform surgery.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Miura's Talk in Kobe</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Report yesterday carried a Domei News Agency dispatch from Kobe on the 14th, stating that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, arrived here this morning on the Japanese Yusen Kaisha Haruna Maru, and told Japanese reporters that Japan is now seeking to reorganize the Shanghai Municipal Council according to the fundamental policy of establishing a new order in East Asia. In order to maintain peace and order in the Public Concession, it is necessary to</p>
<p>Reorganize the Municipal Council</p>
<p>This point is only opposed by a small number of people in Shanghai, and most people admit that the current system based on the land regulations is a typical anachronism. The root problem regarding the dispute over the Shanghai Public Concession must eliminate the foreign pressure that leaves China in a semi-colonial state. It is necessary to immediately pay attention to the issues of amending or abolishing the land regulations, strictly controlling</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Publications</p>
<p>Changing the status of Chinese courts, and prohibiting the hanging of the Chinese national flag. Although some foreigners in Shanghai acknowledge the necessity of Japan having a greater say in the Municipal Council, they believe that changing the land regulations without the permission of the Nationalist government is an illegal act. The issue of amending the land regulations should be resolved by the Nanjing Reformed Government and the Shanghai Consular Body. Foreigners fear</p>
<p>Japan Will Use Force</p>
<p>To solve this problem in its own favor. Miura believes that resolving the dispute over the French Concession court is simpler than resolving the same issue in the Public Concession, because the status of the two foreign-administered areas is different. Miura is going to Tokyo to hold talks with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He left here by train at 12:27 PM today (14th).</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities Investigate Households Flying Flags</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that, according to today's (15th) Japanese newspapers in this city, the Japanese authorities are currently conducting door-to-door investigations in the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek and in the French Concession to compile a list of those flying the Chinese national flag. This action is being taken "for future use." Chinese people who fly the Nationalist flag at this time are all anti-Japanese. The authorities in both concessions, knowing that the Japanese are preparing to compile such a list, are watching the Japanese activities with obvious distaste and attention. According to the two concession authorities, the Chinese national flag is permitted to be flown on eight commemorative days throughout the year. When a Japanese reporter asked a Japanese army officer about this matter, it was reported that he was unaware of this activity, but that the Japanese would certainly regard those who fly the Chinese national flag as enemies.</p>
<p>Sato Acting Japanese Consul-General</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has received a notice stating briefly that during the temporary absence of Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, the affairs of the Consulate-General will be handled by the Acting Consul-General Sato.</p>

<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the US Special Commissioner to the Philippines, McNutt, accompanied by his family, arrived in Shanghai at 8:45 AM this morning (15th) on the American warship USS Chaumont. When reporters and members of the US Chamber of Commerce welcome committee prepared to go to the USS Chaumont by ferry, they learned that McNutt had already landed with US Commander of the Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, and would</p>
<p>Meet the reporters at the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM this morning, reporters finally met McNutt at the Cathay Hotel. When asked about his chances of being nominated as a presidential candidate by the Democratic Party in 1940, McNutt replied that this matter would be determined by fate. McNutt refused to discuss politics.</p>
<p>A Pleasure Trip</p>
<p>Only. The white-haired special commissioner also said that his two years as special commissioner to the Philippines had been the most enjoyable and interesting period of his life, and a very satisfactory experience. When asked if he would resign immediately after arriving in the United States, McNutt replied that he could not discuss the matter of resignation until he had met with President Roosevelt. When asked about the purpose of his trip to North China, McNutt replied that he could not leave the East without visiting China's most interesting</p>
<p>Ancient Capital, Beijing.</p>
<p>This trip was also intended to allow his wife and daughters to appreciate the scenery of the East, as his wife and daughters had not left the islands since arriving in the Philippines in 1937. McNutt continued to talk about the commercial future of Britain and the United States in the East, saying that he had asked himself this question in the morning, but could not predict the development of this situation. When asked whether the Philippines, in light of the current world chaos, would be willing to remain under the American flag, McNutt said that he would like the Filipinos to answer this question themselves, but according to his opinion, the feelings of the Filipinos on this matter indicate that they are willing to remain</p>
<p>Under American Administration</p>
<p>Until after 1946. If McNutt resigns, his successor is likely to be the current Under Secretary of State and Chairman of the Philippine Islands Affairs Committee, Sayre. McNutt and his family are scheduled to depart Shanghai at 5:00 PM today on the USS Chaumont for Qinhuangdao, stay briefly in Tianjin, and continue to Beijing, planning to stay until the 28th of this month. Then, at the end of the month, they will return to Shanghai, stay for a week, and take the President Coolidge liner to the United States.</p>

<p>The left-hand figure reprints the "Tokyo Official Gazette," showing the huge expenses of Japan in the current Sino-Japanese War, which can be compared with the expenses of Japan in several decisive wars in modern history. This figure allows one to represent the great increase in China's strength. In 1894, Japan only spent 200 million Japanese yen to defeat imperial China. From 1904 to 1905, Japan was able to defeat Tsarist Russia with military expenditures of 1.7 billion yen, but from 1937 to 1939, the Japanese Diet had to allocate nearly 1.2 trillion yen, which was still not enough to defeat modern, democratic China.

<p>The Jiangsu Province Relief Affairs Association and the Jiangsu Province Branch of the Extraordinary Period Refugee Relief Committee have been reorganized into the Provincial Relief Society in accordance with the organizational regulations of the relief societies in various provinces promulgated by the National Government. The members of the association have now been separately appointed. In addition to the chairman being concurrently held by the acting chairman and the members of the provincial party committee being ex officio members, public groups and gentry in the province who are enthusiastic about relief work have been hired as members of the association, including Zhang Yipeng, Du Yuesheng, Yan Huiqing, Wen Lanting, Han Guojun, Zhou Zuomin, Chen Taoyi, Huang Qinglan, Wang Qingmu, Pan Xulun, Di Chuqing, Tang Wenzhi, Wu Yunzhai, Yu Xiujia, Lu Xigeng, Yang Yongqing, Liu Yiwei, Yu Nan, Wang Shuzha, Shen Enfu, Wu Tongju, Cai Pei, Yang Weiyu, Xie Shiqiang, Yu Shushen, Shen Weixian, Qu Wenzhong, Jiang Zhaojiu, Qian Jihou, Li Xichun, Zhang Jingli, Cai Mailian, Xu Nian, Shen Baojun, Liu Zhongzhuo, Su Qiliu, Qian Linshu, Jiang Ruo, Wang Hongzao, Zhu Bofu, Pang Shusen, Gu Jisheng, Zhou Tongcheng, Tian Yuban, Zhu Jiazhen, Yu Fengming, Huang Pichen, Shi Mingyong, Wang Xueyi, Liu Kejun, Zhu Shaowen, Ji Longtu, Wu Chongxue, Shi Shengzhi, and Zhu Tinghua.

<p>After the "China Workers' Welfare Association" was "established" under the instigation of the Japanese puppets, in order to expand its popular strength, the "Secretary-General" Lin Zhi-jiong sent henchmen to lure various trade unions in the city to participate in cooperation, but they were all sternly rejected. The association had no choice but to use "relief for the unemployed" and the free issuance of inland passes as a pretext to entice ignorant workers to join. The general unemployed masses and idle elements took the opportunity to join, and fabricated trade union names to deceive the Japanese puppets and embezzle allowances. Recently, due to the uneven distribution of loot among some internal elements, a shootout occurred. Tang, of the Shuidian Workers' Union in the former Nanshi District, was reported to the Japanese military police and arrested, causing panic among the general members of the Welfare Association, who resigned en masse. Therefore, although the association is still extremely active on the surface, it has actually fallen into disintegration and is likely to eventually dissolve itself.</p>

<p>After the meat industry shops and stalls in the city were forced to suspend business, yesterday was the third day. All shops were open as usual and order was good. Yesterday, slaughtered white pork was transported from Hongkou and offered to various households, but was rejected by all. The authorities attached great importance to the trend and were planning a solution. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Closed Shops and Stalls in Good Order</p>
<p>Since the city's more than 2,000 meat industry shops and meat stalls were illegally seized fresh pork by the "Livestock Market" and were forced to suspend business on the 13th of this month, yesterday was the third day. Although there were no goods on the market, the shop doors were open as usual. All the staff were stationed in the shops, and order was good. The industry endured the pain of sacrificing business and respected the city appearance within the boundaries, and the degree of collective adherence to the law is commendable.</p>
<p>Hongkou Meat Cannot Be Sold</p>
<p>In addition to the three slaughterhouses on Mintiniyin Road in the French Concession and North Chengdu Road in the Public Concession, which have officially stopped slaughtering fresh pigs, there is also the slaughterhouse established by the Municipal Council at 10 Shajing Road, Disweiru Road, Hongkou, which is larger in scale than the three. , it is still slaughtering pigs as usual. All the fresh pigs transported to Shanghai by Japanese ships and German and Italian commercial ships every day are slaughtered at the Shajing Road slaughterhouse. After being stamped by the Municipal Council's Health Inspection Office, they are still sold within the boundary. At the same time, the pork slaughtered by Japanese merchants is cut into small pieces and placed in cloth bags. It is transported from Hongkou to the Public Concession in small carts and peddled to various meat shops. General meat shops refused to accept it. Since the meat industry shop</p>
<p>The Authorities are Planning a Solution.</p>
<p>Since the overall shutdown of the market, the authorities of the two concessions are considering a solution for the sake of the industry's business. According to news obtained by the Dagang News Agency, the Municipal Council, in addition to advising the hunting industry and other groups in the meat industry to order their colleagues to resume business as soon as possible, has stated that due to the complexity of the dispute, it may submit the situation to the consular body for discussion and handling.

<p>English language, Da Mei Evening News, said that according to news from the inland, the people of Su, Wan, Lu, and Yu provinces, under the direction of the Japanese Army Special Service Department, organized the Anti-British Joint Association, and will engage in large-scale anti-British activities in various districts in late April and early May, with Xuzhou being the most important. The anti-British movement in that area began on April 23. On that day, a mass rally was held in the afternoon, with participants shouting</p>
<p>Anti-British slogans</p>
<p>Afterwards, they sang anti-British songs. The general idea was as follows: "Since the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, Britain has been the chief culprit. Since the Opium War, Britain has forced us to pay reparations and opened treaty ports. Now we will stop the British from invading China and strengthen our anti-British front." The anti-British movement procedure mainly used by each joint association starts with anti-British propaganda, and then</p>

<p>The Gaodeng wheel of the German firm Lulin Foreign Company sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai on the afternoon of the 30th of last month, and was intercepted by a Japanese warship on the JinTan waters of Dinghai on May 1st and taken to Shanghai, where it was anchored at No. 21 floating dock on the Yangshupu River. It has been more than half a month since then. After the ship was detained, the German Consulate in Shanghai protested to the Japanese side, and after several negotiations, it was released. According to Dagang News Agency reporters who visited the Gaodeng wheel office at 452 Jiangxi Road in this city yesterday, the ship was released at 5:00 p.m. yesterday (15th) and sailed to Roosevelt Pier that night and moored there, but the flight schedule has not yet been determined. In addition, the Tianbao wheel of the German firm Shi Yide Foreign Company and the Weijin wheel of Hengshi Foreign Company will also be released.</p>
<p>De Ping to Wen</p>
<p>The De Ping wheel of the Italian Zhongyi Company was detained by a Japanese warship. Because the ship is entirely owned by Italian merchants, it was released after the Italian Consul General in Shanghai negotiated with the Japanese side, and anchored at the No. 29 Customs floating dock. It is learned that the ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning with the Ende wheel. De Ping carried some passengers and cargo, which was the first return voyage after the ship was released.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Min Flight Halted</p>
<p>In recent days, Japanese warships have been traveling frequently along the coast of Fujian Province, harassing the shore with artillery fire from time to time, and Japanese aircraft have also bombed Fuzhou and Quanzhou. The situation is very tense. The military authorities in Fujian Province have stepped up their alert. Shanghai-to-Min flights, except for Quanzhou, which has banned sailing, are still allowed to sail in Fuzhou and Xinghua, but various shipping companies are watching because of the tense situation there. However, Jardine Matheson's Lisheng wheel is scheduled to sail to Fuzhou on the 19th, and if Xinghua is peaceful, it also plans to sail to the bay.</p>
<p>Dinghai Tranquil</p>
<p>The Hana Wheel of the German Far East Company, the second decision to travel on the Shanghai-Dinghai Line, returned to Shanghai from Dinghai on the 13th. It was expected to arrive at 4:00 p.m. on the 14th, but because it was inspected by a Japanese warship on the Dinghai waters for two hours, it did not arrive in Shanghai until 7:00 a.m. on the 15th. In the afternoon of the same day, it departed from Shanghai to Dinghai for the third time. According to passengers who took the wheel from Dinghai to Shanghai, the situation in Dinghai is currently tranquil and normal. All the rumors outside are unfounded.</p>

<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that the Italian mail ship Caesar, which chartered to transport German and Austrian Jewish refugees, is scheduled to carry the refugees to Shanghai this afternoon (15th). This morning, the reporter asked a person in charge about the housing problem for the large number of refugees who are about to arrive. It is reported that it is expected that 702 refugees will take the Caesar wheel. We have been able to make them get a place to live. Some people can live in Riverside Mansion, and others can live in Jewish families already in Shanghai. However, the future problems are quite serious. Many more houses are needed to cope with it. There are 116 refugees suffering from scarlet fever in the temporary hospital on Zhaofeng Road. Only one new case was reported yesterday, so the spread of scarlet fever is expected to end.</p>

<p>To maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens, the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee suggested that the concession authorities order foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai, find ways to clear internal supply routes, and strictly enforce price limits. The market situation yesterday morning showed signs of improvement, and public sentiment was stabilizing, but underground transactions were still not completely eliminated. It is also understood that Wuhu in Anhui Province has lifted its export ban, and the amount of grain being transported has been increasing recently. The seventh survey of rice reserves has been completed, with a total of 553,248 bags. The Chamber of Commerce has also replied, agreeing to send representatives to participate in the Evaluation Committee. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Market Stabilizing, Underground Transactions Not Suppressed</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of goods and manipulation by domestic traders in the soybean and rice market in recent days, public sentiment was uneasy, and the market once tended towards disorder. Underground transactions also resurfaced. After the Evaluation Committee strictly enforced price limits and ordered the Market Management Committee to conduct strict inspections and reward whistleblowers, the market opened as usual at 9:00 yesterday morning. Underground transactions were not suppressed, but because the supply of goods gradually increased, public sentiment has been stabilizing, and the market situation is better than before.</p>
<p>Increasing Shipments from Suzhou and Changzhou</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the rice industry yesterday that in the rice-producing areas of Suzhou and Changzhou, merchants were previously discouraged from transporting rice due to increased levies and taxes in the area, making it unprofitable. Now, after the Evaluation Committee strongly urged them to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens, they have successively begun purchasing rice together. In addition to the small amount of grain transported on the 13th, more rice continued to arrive by train on the 14th, including over 2,600 bags of Suzhou rice and 650 bags of Changzhou rice from Houses 11 and 12 of the He Xia Nan Gang gang. It is also understood that Wuhu in Anhui Province is a major rice-producing area, and many merchants used to transport rice to Shanghai. However, due to the export ban, merchants stopped trading. It is now known that the area has lifted the ban, allowing exports. Hearing the news, merchants from various gangs are preparing to go and purchase rice. A large batch of Wuhu rice should arrive soon.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Replies, Sending Representatives</p>
<p>The Rice Industry Evaluation Committee not only suggested that the concession authorities order foreign rice and find ways to clear internal supply routes but also asked the Chamber of Commerce to send representatives to participate in the Evaluation Committee to provide guidance. It is now known that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce replied to the committee yesterday, saying, "We have received your letter and are fully aware of the painstaking efforts you have made to regulate rice prices, which we greatly admire. Regarding your request for our Chamber to send representatives to participate, it is our duty to do so. We will send another letter with our chosen representatives after they are designated. We are replying in advance for your information."</p>
<p>Rice Reserve Registration: Pessimistic Outlook</p>
<p>The Rice Industry Evaluation Committee decided to conduct registration of rice owners, which began on the 12th of this month, scheduled for one week, ending on the 18th. As of yesterday, although there were many rice owners who came to collect registration forms, very few filled them out and registered, all taking a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the prospects for conducting rice owner registration are quite pessimistic. It is heard that the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee will report the situation to the two concession authorities and the Chamber of Commerce to facilitate investigation and action.</p>
<p>Seventh Survey: Accurate Rice Reserve Numbers</p>
<p>The seventh rice reserve survey ended yesterday. The total amount of rice stored in the city is 553,248 bags, a decrease of 13,890 bags compared to the previous period.

<p>The Zi Lin News reports that Latvian people around the world are celebrating the rebirth of Latvia today (the 15th). Before May 15, 1934, the Latvian parliament had one hundred members divided into twenty-six political parties, which was quite chaotic. On May 15, 1934, Dr. Ulmanis dismissed the former government and took office as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, leading the National Cabinet. The government has made great efforts in trade and education, such as promoting exports, increasing foreign trade, and providing long-term loans to poor students from funds deposited in the Latvian Bank. Compared to students from other countries, the percentage of students in Latvia is extremely high, with 7,000 students studying at the University of Latvia out of a population of two million. Latvia also has special laws for medical assistance, and those suffering from lung diseases can be isolated and recuperate in government sanatoriums. In the past five years, the government's efforts have brought about many reforms and remarkable achievements. To commemorate this day, the Latvian community in Shanghai has organized the "Latvian May 15th Federation" and will gather at 86 Di Feng Road today to celebrate, inviting Latvian nationals and people from other countries to participate.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Requesting a Stop to Underground Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Rice Shop Association convened an emergency meeting and resolved to write to the two concession authorities and the Chamber of Commerce about the chaotic situation of underground transactions in the rice market, requesting them to devise appropriate measures to stop underground transactions and balance rice prices to maintain the food supply for the people. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully, since this spring, rice prices have been rising steadily without end. Although price limits have been maintained, with a maximum of 14 yuan per picul for the highest quality white rice, market transactions still far exceed the price limit, and it is impossible to restrain them. Later, after a joint meeting of rice industry organizations, based on the situation at the time, it was decided to change the price limit to a maximum of 15 yuan per picul for the highest quality white rice, with clear decisions and penalties to be strictly enforced. Unexpectedly, in recent days, the rising trend has become even more severe, and the market's underground transactions have reached 17 yuan, exceeding the price limit by 2 yuan, pushing market disorder to its extreme. The reason for this is that the number of buyers from the surrounding towns and villages of the city has suddenly increased, which is one of the reasons for the rising trend. Another reason is that speculators have absorbed large quantities of rice and bought it up in the market at inflated prices. With underground transactions rising to 17 yuan, no goods can be bought at the limited price of 15 yuan. Member rice shops are supplying food to the citizens, and cannot stop sales because of this problem. They have to endure buying at underground prices to supply retail sales, suffering huge losses in the dark. If the time is short, they can barely endure the pain and sacrifice. But now the rising trend has been prolonged and has not declined, how can they endure the losses for long and maintain their business? Moreover, after checking the current rice storage in the city's warehouses, it is still sufficient, and although the supply has not arrived as rapidly as before, it has not reached the point of being cut off. Under these circumstances, there should not be such a serious situation, all of which is caused by speculators who have lost their minds, disregard the people's food supply, and only know how to monopolize and seek heavy profits. This has caused member rice shops to suffer the pain of buying expensive and selling cheap. Price limits are like a formality and have no restraining effect. Member rice shops have come to the association one after another to report their difficulties, and we are unable to cope. The difficulties are very great. Moreover, there is still a long time before the new rice is available. The current underground rice price in the market has reached 17 yuan, and the common people have difficulty keeping warm and full. If effective methods are not devised to stop the rising trend, it is not known where it will end. The reason why rice and food are directly related to the people's food and indirectly related to local security is that this letter describes the chaotic situation of the rice market and reports it to the committee, hoping that you will review and approve it, and devise appropriate measures to stop underground transactions in the market, so as not to affect security."</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the pseudo-"Municipal Government" has indiscriminately levied heavy taxes, increasing the burden on the people. Recently, the pseudo-"Public Works Bureau" has started a motor vehicle driver registration, ordering all drivers in the city to go to register and be examined to collect registration fees. But all drivers in the city understand the righteousness and resolutely refuse to participate in the pseudo-organization's examination because no one is willing to work in Nanshi and Zhabei. Yesterday was the first day of registration, and the so-called "Vehicle Management Office of the Public Works Bureau, Shanghai North Branch" (located on Qiujiang Road in Shanghai North) was deserted, with no one going, which was quite desolate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, for the sake of convenient investigation, has specially stipulated that anyone purchasing postage stamps over 50 yuan must fill out a "Postage Stamp Purchase Order" in advance from today onward before purchasing from the ticket seller. The announcement is excerpted as follows: "In order to facilitate checking whether the number of postage stamps purchased by each parcel sender matches the amount of parcel postage paid, from today onward, all parcel senders who purchase postage stamps at each parcel group of the branch in National Currency of 50 yuan and above must fill out a "Postage Stamp Purchase Order" before purchasing from the ticket seller."</p>

<p>According to people from Haining, at around 1:00 a.m. on the 14th of this month, a Japanese military train heading from Hangzhou to Shanghai derailed between Xiashi and Wangdian because the railway tracks were destroyed by guerrillas. It is said that the guerrillas ambushed around the area at the time and shot at the train, fighting with the Japanese soldiers inside until dawn. Yesterday, after inquiring with passengers from Hangzhou, they said that when they passed by, they still saw the destroyed train head lying next to the tracks. The passenger train that left Shanghai on the 14th was delayed for four or five hours while repairing the tracks.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Impact on Foreign Businesses After Establishment of the Pseudo "Huaxing Bank": Attempt to Control Sino-International Trade in Central China, Opening Under Control Equals Closure <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>At first, the Japanese side in the Suzhou-Zhejiang area indiscriminately issued banknotes from colonial banks to make up for their financial difficulties. But as a result of indiscriminate issuance, the currency value plummeted and could not be maintained. Then they changed to issuing so-called "military tickets" to solve their problems. However, the economic goal still could not be achieved, because when the military tickets reached the hands of Chinese and foreign merchants, the merchants used them to buy goods from the Japanese, and the Japanese export merchants took the military tickets back to their own country. So they instigated the "Reformed Government" to establish the "Huaxing Bank" in Shanghai. According to the French-language Beijing Political News, it was recently reported that the Japanese side's policy of controlling "international trade" in North China is about to be extended to Central China to obtain large amounts of foreign exchange. It is said that the implementation of this control is closely related to the establishment of the "Huaxing Commercial Bank." This is completely the same as the control implemented after the establishment of the "United Reserve" in North China. But at this time, opening under control is actually equivalent to closure.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai war, the city's population increased sharply, and residents' housing suddenly became a problem. As a result, there were endless disputes over rent increases, demolition of houses, and forced evictions. The landlord of Yu Fu Li on Kai Zi Er Road, Cheng Ye Company, sued the original tenants for eviction under the pretext of renovating the house after signing a lease with Tong He Company (which is said to be an agent for Xie Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Store) last year. The tenants hired lawyers to defend themselves. After two trials by the Second Special Court and the Third Branch of the High Court, Cheng Ye Company lost the case. Zhu Xue Zeng, the legal representative of the company, was not satisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court. The tenants in the neighborhood filed a complaint with the Supreme Court because Zhu Xue Zeng took advantage of the situation to force them to move out with the intention of making a profit, detailing the lack of grounds for Zhu Xue Zeng's lawsuit for eviction and requesting the appeal to be rejected. Tong He Company filed a complaint with the Second Special Court because Zhu Xue Zeng had not yet handed over the house, suing for compensation of 21,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Le'anfang on Avenue Joffre belongs to the property of a wealthy Cantonese merchant surnamed Zheng and is managed by the British company Tailey. Since February of this year, the company suddenly notified residents of a 20% rent increase. More than 90 households all felt that their livelihoods were already difficult in this extraordinary period. Most of the residents came to seek refuge from the war zone and could not afford it. Moreover, before the war, the houses in Le'anfang were not rented out because the address was remote and most of the houses were empty. Now, due to the war, all of them have been rented out and have made a great profit, while the residents have suffered losses due to the war. There was originally no conflict, and everyone could live together peacefully. But now there is a rent increase. After all the residents insisted on opposing it and sent representatives to negotiate with the company's management, the company said that the owner had instructed it and only agreed to reduce the rent by 10%, and refused to collect the rent as a passive resistance. All the residents have now hired a lawyer to represent them and have been approved by the Shanghai Second Special District District Court to deposit the rent in the court on April 15. After that, the landlord's unreasonable rent increase has been guaranteed by the court, and the people will benefit greatly.</p>

<p>— EL</p>
<p>—An Impressionistic Record of a Visit to Mr. Arthur de C. Sowerby—</p>
<p>Last Saturday, I met Mr. Arthur de C. Sowerby, President of the Royal Asiatic Society on Museum Road, and yesterday morning, I went to his home to see him. When he told me his address, he even drew a simple map and said, "You will see Fosse Garden, and a turn will take you there."</p>
<p>The early summer sunshine, like slightly intoxicating beer, shone on the small lawn in front of the British barracks on Great West Road, baking the bright red roses on the flower rack, making each petal seem about to burst. A squad of Scottish soldiers was resting by the roadside, their delicate flute music and brand-new uniforms seeming to be subdued by the weather, revealing a gentle tone.</p>
<p>Turning into Rosenna Road, the "noise of the city" gradually faded from my ears, and my destination gradually approached.</p>
<p>"Fosse Garden" was already in sight. After walking another five or six steps, in the quiet surroundings, I suddenly heard the "tap tap..." of a typewriter, faintly leaking from the window. I was already standing on the steps in front of the door of the person I was to interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Sowerby himself came to answer the door—a double screen of green gauze. His smiling face and welcoming voice were just what I noticed when suddenly, four dogs simultaneously charged toward their master's guest. Mr. Sowerby, while leading me in, said to me, "Pay them no mind, they won't bite." Sixteen legs moved swiftly ahead of us toward the guest room.</p>
<p>There was already a guest in the guest room. Mr. Sowerby introduced him to me, saying, "This is Mr. Morrison from the London Times." It turned out we were colleagues. Later, I learned that he was the son of Dr. Morrison, born in Beijing, and was collecting material about Chinese natural history for the newspaper he represented.</p>
<p>From the conversation and the readily available materials, I learned about Mr. Sowerby's past, his love for and research into Chinese natural history, fine arts, archaeology, and other achievements, especially regarding Mrs. Harkness and Mr. Yang's hunting of rare and precious animals on the Tibetan border, and the study of the Panda white bear. Of course, Mr. Sowerby's work at the Royal Asiatic Society Museum and his contributions to the scientific community were also what I eagerly wanted to know.</p>
<p>First, I asked him, "Mr. Sowerby, is your Chinese transliteration called 'Wen Pei'?—We often transliterate it as these two characters in the newspapers."</p>
<p>He said, "No, no, no. I am called Su A-de. This is the transliteration on my passport, and it has been around for a long time." I said to him, "The character 'A' is relatively colloquial, but some people think it is not elegant." He was very happy, and pointed out his Chinese name on his Chinese works—not yet published—and also asked me to fill in these three Chinese characters in the Chinese transliteration of his English name in the Royal Asiatic Society work report he gave to Mr. Morrison.</p>
<p>The environment of the guest room where we were talking was very beautiful: In terms of nature, it was very quiet because it was far away from the noise of the city. To the south was a small garden, with a lush green lawn full of optimistic colors. Outside the two floor-to-ceiling gauze windows, there was a grape trellis, and below it were planted some flowers and bamboo, red and purple vying for beauty, and exotic flowers blooming, adding many overflowing passions to the optimistic brocade, fully expressing the scenery of early summer.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the furnishings in the room, like Mr. Sowerby's love for Chinese art, naturally produced a scale of attraction. Ancient porcelain, broken tiles, Han jade, and calligraphy were all placed in appropriate positions—the host was an expert, proficient in connoisseurship, and certainly not like a "poor man suddenly rich" who only cared about accumulation.</p>
<p>Mr. Sowerby likes hunting and studying zoology. He examines birds, beasts, fish, shrimps, scales, and shells carefully. Therefore, his love for raising dogs seems to be tinged with the aroma of scientific research in addition to mere affection. He told us that the four dogs—who often represent the owner in expressing goodwill to guests—are British breeds with American blood, Bull Dogs of two generations. The older dog is only about six years old. While we were talking, two puppies stood separately on either side of their mother, nursing; after they were full, they chased each other back and forth, playing endlessly. Under the long gauze window, a small door was specially opened for them to enter and exit, directly reaching the garden, which also fully shows the host's thoughtfulness towards them.</p>
<p>After we talked for a while about the Royal Asiatic Society Museum, Mr. Sowerby invited us to visit his collection of Chinese antiques, animal specimens, books, and study. We went upstairs and entered a small room, which contained two large cabinets, two bookshelves, and a half table—completely in the Chinese style. It was as if we had entered an antique shop, and the roof and floor seemed to be filled with an ancient atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mr. Sowerby pointed out several antiques, such as Qin mirrors, Han jade, bronze wares from the Yin and Shang dynasties, ancient porcelain, and ivory carvings, and explained their age, production, and characteristics. Mr. Morrison greatly admired these things, and as for me, I seemed to have a special affection for antiques, and only silently prayed for them in my heart.</p>
<p>I asked, "Mr. Sowerby, what do you particularly like?"</p>
<p>"I like everything."</p>
<p>"Do you particularly like Chinese porcelain?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I like ancient Chinese porcelain very much, but unfortunately it is easily broken, so other things are easier to handle."</p>
<p>He pointed to an ivory carving of Marco Polo, dressed in short clothes and wearing a sword, with a spirited expression; and a magnetic camel, praising their beauty of production.</p>
<p>There are still many good things "upstairs"! The four dogs followed us three people upstairs again. With them accompanying us, they could harmonize the dryness of antiques and animal specimens, and the host felt even more interested. For example, on the escalator from the second floor to the third floor, Mr. Sowerby patted his beloved dogs and said; "I go up and down the stairs every day, and they don't know how many times they have to follow me up and down!"</p>
<p>This is our naturalist's study, which is the heart of this house. If we don't say it is where Mr. Sowerby "wracks his brains," this room is slightly different from the other rooms. Books, documents, specimens, pictures... etc., are really dazzling. The floor was piled with many books, and the walls were hung with many picture frames, most of which were hand-drawn specimens of birds and beasts by Su Guang-sheng. Some landscape paintings and the like were also the work of this old gentleman.</p>
<p>He pointed to a landscape he sketched in Shanxi and said, "I painted it in imitation of the Chinese landscape style." As he spoke, he laughed, but in fact, the painting was not bad at all.</p>
<p>At first, I didn't know what treasures he had hidden in the two large cabinets. Later, he pulled them open for me to see. It turned out that what was hidden inside could represent the glorious page in his history of natural history research in the past thirty years, and these were all animal specimens.</p>
<p>Like gray squirrels and fox skins piled in a fur shop, each drawer contained animal specimens, the large ones being monkey specimens more than four feet high, and the small ones being rat specimens two or three inches long, all of which were placed with camphor pills. Other animals such as pangolins and pheasants...etc., each specimen was attached with a label, recording its scientific name, date and place of hunting, etc. Mr. Sowerby is an old hand at making specimens. Many of the specimens in the Shanghai Museum attached to the Royal Asiatic Society on Museum Road were "executed" and "inspected and manufactured" by him! The skins are peeled and preserved.</p>
<p>In a long drawer, he pulled out a rat specimen, with fluffy fur and straight feet. It didn't seem to have anything special at first, but after Mr. Sowerby's explanation, I realized that it had a great origin.</p>
<p>It turned out that this was a type of desert rat that could jump. In 1908, Mr. Sowerby participated in the "Duke Peter of Oldenburg's East Asia Expedition" led by Mr. Andersson, and was captured in the "Wah Tu Shih I Desert". The scientific name is Dtpus So werby—using Mr. Sowerby's surname to represent that he discovered it. A small rat specimen has such an origin, no wonder his is famously rich.</p>

<p>Zhu Jin-hou, a salt merchant residing at 1045 Gordon Road, received three threatening letters from bandits impersonating guerrillas demanding loans from April to the 14th of this month. The wording was very strong. The first letter stated that he must contribute 50,000 yuan, and that someone would be sent to deliver the money in a paper package at the elevator on the third floor of the Dahua Hotel on Edward Road at 19:00 last month, with the person holding</p>
<p>an umbrella</p>
<p>a newspaper, etc. Zhu Jin-hou ignored it, did not send anyone to negotiate, nor did he report it to the police. On the 10th of this month, he received a second letter stating that the location was not good and that he should send it to the elevator on the second floor of the Dafang Hotel on the same road within three days, and the final date was set for 16:00 on the 12th, and the loan was increased to 100,000 yuan, otherwise, when you go out in a car, you will be thrown at with hand bombs. Zhu Jin-hou was</p>
<p>exhausted by these people's</p>
<p>constant harassment, so he reported the situation to the Putuo Road Police Station. Hua Detective Feng Baishun received secret information from a source and arrested two bandits, Qiu Yunlong and Xia Zengfu, from Suzhou, at the corner of Loulang Road and Hed Road at noon yesterday. A threatening letter was found on Qiu's person (agreeing to send someone to hand over the money at Room 12 of the Dongxing Hotel on Lafayette Road in the French Concession on the afternoon of the 17th), and</p>
<p>brought to the police station</p>
<p>yesterday morning to be sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted for attempted extortion under Article 346, Paragraph 3, and requested an extension of the detention of accomplices. The two defendants' confessions were vague. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further review.</p>
<p>A Young Girl Fell Ill and Sought Medical Treatment: The Doctor Abducted and Raped Her, Instigated Her to Run Away and Live Together: The Girl's Mother Found Out and Filed a Criminal Lawsuit</p>
<p>Chen Wangshi, a Suzhou woman, 46 years old, residing at 1 Wu Feng Lane, at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Luban Road, hired lawyer Yan Hu-yongsheng to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing lacquer Lin-sheng (54 years old, Henan native), a gynecology doctor residing at 10 Yongyu Lane, at the intersection of Belle Road and Lafayette Road, of abducting her daughter Chen Sannan (19 years old this year) and raping her,</p>
<p>instigating her to run away</p>
<p>and live together, disrupting the family, and requesting investigation and punishment in accordance with Article 241, and filing a civil lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 1,000 yuan in consolation money and 2,000 yuan in alimony for life. It is said that the plaintiff's daughter Sannan was treated by the defendant in May and June of last year because of illness. After several consecutive decisions, the defendant saw that Sannan was beautiful and young and could be deceived, and used teaching</p>
<p>medicine as a reason</p>
<p>to seduce her. On October 7 of the same year, Sannan suddenly took soft luggage and clothes and went out and did not return. After her daughter disappeared, the plaintiff sent people to look for her everywhere without a trace. Until April 12 of this year, the plaintiff met Sannan at the Xiaocai Chang on Ximen Road and ordered her to go home together. She began to ask in detail about seeking treatment from the defendant due to illness and being seduced to live together in the house at 225 Belle Road, and being</p>
<p>seduced and raped.</p>
<p>Therefore, she negotiated with the defendant, but he ignored it. Compelled, she sued according to the law. The court, based on the complaint, opened the Second Criminal Court by Judge Liao Yuan yesterday afternoon to summon the defendant. Both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Hu Yongsheng, stated the intent of the lawsuit. Then, the defendant's lawyer Ji Chao said that the defendant was originally scheduled to appear in court today, but someone asked him to treat an emergency, so</p>
<p>he couldn't make it in time.</p>
<p>He will definitely appear in court next time, and stated his defense intentions. The court ruled that in criminal cases, the defendant must appear in court in person before the trial can proceed. Today, the defendant has no valid reason for not appearing, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, it was ruled that the hearing would be rescheduled to the 20th of this month. If the defendant does not appear again, he will be arrested without fail.</p>

<p>Liang Bifa, a native of Yancheng, 52 years old this year, residing at 92 Tianzhu Tang Street (near the new North Gate) in the French Concession, previously hired lawyer Yang Huchen to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing his fellow villager Zhou Butian (30 years old, serving as a guard at the No. 110 branch of the Bank of Communications near the New North Gate, the younger brother of Zhou Buguang, a former French police detective) of enticing his daughter Liang Gendi, 19 years old this year, hiding her, disrupting the family, and requesting an investigation and punishment in accordance with the law, and also filing a civil lawsuit,</p>
<p>ordering the person to be handed over</p>
<p>and listing neighbors Ni Fengwu and Ni Xue's wife as helping to entice the defendant. The court, based on the complaint, held a hearing by Judge Liao Yuan. The defendants refused to admit the enticement and hired lawyers Zhu Yanqing and others to defend them. It was ruled that the defendants should be released on bail and the hearing should be rescheduled. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing was continued. The plaintiff and the defendant appeared in court with their lawyers. The plaintiff presented the witness, the young daughter Dawangzi, to testify about the process of Zhou Butian and the Ni couple colluding to entice Liang Gendi, and claimed that Gendi</p>
<p>was enticed to go out</p>
<p>on the sixth day of the first lunar month. When questioned, the defendants still refused to admit the enticement, and Liang Gendi, also known as Liang Baolan, appeared in court with lawyer Qu Shiji, and testified that she was 21 years old this year, and had been working at the Maochang Egg Factory for six years, with annual insurance policies to prove it. She did not know Zhou Butian, and there was no matter of being enticed to leave home. It was because her father wanted to sell her to someone to be the fourth concubine. She refused and feared being forced, so she left home and sought legal relief from lawyer Qu. She only asked for</p>
<p>freedom of marriage</p>
<p>and was now outside, without any improper affairs with other men. She did not want to go home with her father today, fearing oppression, and would wait until the procedures were completed before returning home. The court verified the testimony and ordered a debate, then announced the end of the trial, and scheduled the verdict for the 20th. Liang Gendi was allowed freedom, and the defendants were still released on original bail. After the court adjourned, Liang Bifa, along with his brother-in-law Li Hongfu and Li Hongfu, and his aunt, wanted to forcibly drag his daughter Gendi home. Because the daughter refused, she cried and shouted loudly, and the sound of people shook. The bailiff's attempt to stop her was ineffective, and she</p>
<p>cried out injustice</p>
<p>even more frantically. The bailiff called a Western bailiff, Li Hong (transliteration), to come and suppress her. Judge Liao reopened the court, arguing that violence could not be used in the court. Liang and Li insisted on being allowed to take their daughter home, but the daughter insisted on not going back, even if she died in court. Finally, the court ruled that Liang Gendi should be temporarily detained in the detention center of this court, pending verification. The daughter's father and others reluctantly left.</p>

<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" stated that a British man's arm was violently twisted by a Japanese sentinel on the Suzhou River Bridge yesterday morning (14th), proving that there are still impolite Japanese sentinels on the Suzhou River Bridge. The British man recently protested to the British Consulate and the Public Works Department. He was driving across the Waibaidu Bridge yesterday morning when he saw a long line of trucks being checked for passes, so he drove to the right to overtake the trucks. Suddenly, a Japanese sentinel jumped onto the running board of the car, grabbed the British man's right arm and twisted it. The British man did not resist and drove the car back several yards. An example of disrespect also occurred on Sichuan Road. Two British women were in a car driven by a Chinese driver. After the Japanese sentinel checked the driver's pass, he suddenly threw it into the car onto a vase, breaking the flowers in the vase.</p>

<p>Jiang Yonglu, a native of Wuxi, 24 years old, residing at 150 Zao Pilian Lane, Pu En Ji Shi Road, in the French Concession, recently followed the flower club kings Mao Axiang and Li Xiaoxian, and opened a flower club listening tube in his home. Because a group of gangsters in the area failed to extort unspoken rules, they harbored a grudge. At 8 p.m. the night before, someone came to his house and called Jiang out to talk. Jiang, unprepared for an accident, happily followed him out. When he walked to the intersection of Pu En Ji Shi Road and Mai Er Xi Ai Road, he was stopped by more than a dozen people, who first threw lime on Jiang's face, and then stabbed Jiang's right head, both ribs, and both thighs several times, injuring him and causing him to fall to the ground, shouting for help. No. 1147 Chinese police officers heard the sound and rushed to arrest the murderers Li Bingfa (27 years old, native of Hangzhou), Jin A Jin (49 years old, native of Suzhou), Wang Daodao, also known as Wang Longyong (40 years old, native of Tongzhou), and Shi Longbao (40 years old, native of Chongming), and found two murder weapons. They took them to the police station and sent the injured person to the hospital for treatment. His injuries were very serious. Yesterday, the police station sent the defendants to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Zhang Minsheng questioned them. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case and requested an extension of the investigation, waiting for the victim to recover from his injuries to sue. Then, detective Cao Chuanbiao reported the process of investigating and arresting the defendants after the incident, and presented the murder weapon and blood-stained clothes to the court. When questioned, Li Bingfa confessed that because Jiang refused to distribute the 560 yuan won at the flower club, he invited Jin and the other three to commit the crime. Jin, Wang, and Shi all confessed that Li invited them to help. The court verified the confession and ordered the hearing to be rescheduled to the 19th. The defendants were detained.</p>
<p>Inspector Was Assaulted</p>
<p>Gu Songlin (34 years old), a native of Pudong, an inspector at the Cade Theater on Cade Road in the Public Concession, was walking through Fuxiang Lane on Sima Road last night when suddenly a dozen or so gangsters, holding wooden sticks, beat Gu more than a dozen times without asking why. Gu's head and body were injured at the time. The perpetrators, seeing that their goal had been achieved, dispersed in a commotion. Later, Chinese police officers sent Gu by car to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>A man and a woman went to the Commercial Hotel on Avenue Edward VII to book a room the day before yesterday (the 11th). The bellboy led them to room 144. It is said that the man's name was Wu Zhiliang, 28 years old, a native of Suzhou, and the woman's name was Wang Fengmei, 27 years old, also a native of the same town. It has been four days now. Unexpectedly, at about 6 a.m. yesterday morning, the man and woman committed suicide by swallowing poison in the room, and wrote a suicide note in advance, addressed to Wang Xiuji Optical Shop at No. 94 Tangjia Lane, Qipu Road. The night shift bellboy, Wang Dexing, a local, discovered it and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, summoning an ambulance to the scene and transporting them to Baolong Hospital, but the rescue was ineffective, and they died one after another. Afterwards, it was learned that the man, Wu Zhiliang, was a craftsman in Wu Rensheng Optical Shop in Yude Lane on Yunnan Road, with a monthly income of more than 20 yuan, which was enough to make a living. Wang Fengmei had been a female greeter at Xianshi Amusement Park. The two were passionately in love, inseparable. But the man had a wife, and the woman had a husband, so they could not grow old together, which was a pity. They resorted to this desperate measure, emulating the lovebirds.</p>
<p>Couple Took Poison: Wang Jinsheng, 23 years old, a native of Changshu, and his wife Xie, 22 years old, lived in the countryside of Changshu for generations. They came to Shanghai to avoid the war and stayed at his brother's home at No. 30 Hongshou Lane, Xinzha Road, in the Public Concession, for a year and a half. Recently, due to economic pressure, they suddenly had the idea of ​​being tired of the world. A few days ago, he and his wife Xie went to the Daxin Hotel at No. 442 Guangxi Road and booked room 222 for accommodation. At about 1 p.m. yesterday afternoon, the tea man discovered that the couple had committed suicide by swallowing poisonous liquid.

<h3 id="e116">A Major Obstacle to the Progress of Chinese Medicine <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>Currently circulating in Chinese society are both the old medicine inherited from ancient times and the new medicine acquired from the West. However, neither of these can be said to be entirely sound. It's like one is an old man, and the other is a young child. How can we make the old younger and the young older, so that both become strong and vigorous, and able to overcome all diseases? Only then can we hope for a strong nation and a strong people. The progress of medicine relies on experimentation. Basic academic theory is indispensable, but clinical experience is even more important. Medicine has no limits and is constantly changing. Continuous learning is necessary for progress to be made. Therefore, whether practicing physicians or medical students, they must have the opportunity to boldly practice, free from environmental constraints and with guaranteed freedom. Only then can they delve into deep research. Looking back at our society, one cannot help but feel disappointed. People's understanding of medical common sense is superficial, and their faith in the medical community is practically zero. If one asks a "highly skilled" old-style doctor to revise a prescription, it is considered an insult or a sign of haste. Prescriptions and medications must be "well-rounded" and "without flaws." In reality, if one is already asking a highly skilled doctor for revision, why bother with a prescription at all? And a well-rounded prescription without flaws is unlikely to be effective. It's not that traditional doctors are unwilling to take responsibility, but they are constrained by the environment and dare not be bold. Are our new doctors any different? Because we don't simply write prescriptions and be done with it, we have more opportunities to be blamed. In recent years, we have heard and witnessed countless medical disputes, most of which are illogical. Some abuse their power, some make unreasonable demands, and some use the situation to extort money. As a result, those who are well-versed in worldly affairs seek only to avoid mistakes and not to achieve success when faced with difficult illnesses. They dare not lightly use aggressive treatments that involve some risk. Therefore, they inevitably deal with patients perfunctorily, abandoning opportunities for research and advancement in medical matters. Otherwise, if something unexpected happens, regardless of right or wrong, they will inevitably face lawsuits, or even worse. In this situation, how can they delve into deep research? How can they increase clinical experience? And how can they even talk about improvement and progress? Isn't this a major obstacle to the progress of Chinese medicine!</p>
<p>Common Sense About Diseases</p>
<h3 id="e117">Various Vitamin Deficiency Diseases <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Guangdi</p>
<p>At this time of widespread warfare, expanding war zones, and increasing numbers of refugees, the hardship of life has reached its extreme. The most significant factor affecting human health is the scarcity of food sources and soaring prices, leading to widespread nutritional deficiencies among the general population. In the past twenty-two months, there have been alarming records. I will briefly describe them, hoping that those concerned about nutrition will listen.</p>
<p>(1) Vitamin B Deficiency Disease, also known as Beriberi. This disease is prevalent in prisons, shelters, schools, factories, ships, and military encampments. The cause is generally attributed to the consumption of polished white rice and overly refined bread. Last year, during the food crisis, citizens ate foreign rice, which was white in color but inferior in quality to domestic rice. Therefore, those who consumed it were prone to beriberi, especially in prisons and refugee camps. Rice bran and wheat bran are rich in vitamin B, which is essential for maintaining human development and preventing polyneuritis. It also plays a vital role in sustaining heart strength. American physicians Wiese and Wilkins examined 120 cases of heart disease and confirmed that a deficiency of vitamin B (abbreviated as B) can trigger changes in the heart and blood vessels. These changes originate from the nervous system, circulatory system, and heart muscle. The obvious symptoms include rapid and slow heart rate, gallop rhythm, excessive vagal nerve reflexes, cardiomegaly, shortness of breath, pulmonary congestion, venous relaxation, and generalized edema.

<p>Common Sense on Dietary Therapy</p>
<h3 id="e118">Scientific Research on Dietary Therapy (Continued from Issue 16) <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhenyu</p>
<p>The dietary therapy for those who engage in physical labor and those who engage in mental labor should be different. Physical labor involves the full movement of the body, invigorating the blood, strengthening muscles, and promoting metabolism, thereby strengthening bones and producing strength. Therefore, such activities enhance development, increasing appetite and gradually increasing energy. Martial artists use this to train their bones. However, mental labor limits activity to the brain, which is the nervous system and the controller of the body. Its constituent cells are specialized and have their own functions, so their forms are different. In 1937, research by Berger, Walt, Loomis, Harvey, Hobert, Griffiths, and Nevin revealed that all brain activity is generated by electrical impulses, and these currents are constant. However, changes in electrical waves vary depending on the differences in electrical stimulation. If the brain develops abnormalities, such as epilepsy or lethargy, the electrical waves also exhibit abnormal patterns. Therefore, this is now used to diagnose brain diseases. Since mental labor involves using the brain and its operation is electrical, the amount of heat consumed is minimal. Experiments by Benedict have shown that the heat generated by half a peanut is sufficient to supply the needs of a mental worker for one hour. Although mental laborers are intelligent, their physical strength deteriorates due to disuse. Due to deterioration, the metabolic rate declines. When the metabolic rate declines, the appetite decreases. When the appetite decreases, the digestive capacity decreases. When the digestive capacity decreases, the physical strength weakens. If the physical strength weakens, how can one avoid illness?</p>
<p>Dr. Lombard's research on the body temperature of mental laborers showed that during thinking, the brain is filled with blood, the temperature rises, and the temperature of the limbs decreases. Prolonged use easily leads to headaches and cold limbs. He also stated that diet, labor, and rest must be properly allocated. If one is lacking, perfect health cannot be achieved. William Ewart Gladstone, a British Prime Minister, was known as a great statesman worldwide. He often walked when entering or exiting, unless required by protocol. In addition to his official duties, he sawed wood daily for an hour to exercise his body. Since the popularity of automobiles, walking has been considered uncouth, especially in America. As a result, the country has the highest rate of diabetes in the world. This is due to the American automobile tycoons. Should we not reflect on this?</p>
<p>Being fat is not a sign of health, but ordinary people see it as a good sign and call it "getting blessed." Getting blessed means that there is more fat in the body. More fat means more weight. More weight makes movement difficult. More difficult movement leads to more fat accumulation, as more food is converted into fat. As fat increases, it easily occupies the gaps in the muscle system. Over time, this leads to fatty infiltration of various muscle systems, making the person even weaker, constantly sleepy, unable to move easily, eating without using, and the harm is immeasurable.

<h3 id="e120">A Defense of New Poetry <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Guangzu</p>
<p>The early promoters of new literature experienced many difficulties, finally eliminating those "stubborn" obstacles. Over twenty years, thanks to the cultivation and irrigation of many new writers, the garden of new literature has produced many beautiful flowers. However, in recent years, plants grown from the same seeds have hindered the growth of other plants in this garden, which I think is very regrettable.</p>
<p>I have always believed that the entire New Literature Movement is a new poetry movement. If you don't believe me, we can cite some examples. There were informal essays written in vernacular prose during the Ming and Qing dynasties, novels written in vernacular prose pioneered by Cao Xueqin and Shi Nai'an, and dramas written in vernacular prose during the Yuan Dynasty (especially the spoken parts). However, poetry written in vernacular prose is purely a product of the New Literature Movement. Although Bai Juyi wanted his poems to be understood by old women, it was only a theory, not a practice. Furthermore, if we look at Hu Shi's "Forced to Liangshan" in the Collection of Literary Theories of the Liangyou New Literature Series, we will understand that his literary revolution was based on writing poetry in vernacular. Therefore, new poetry is a special product of the New Literature Movement, the core of the New Literature Movement. Those who denigrate new poetry are denigrating the New Literature Movement.</p>
<p>Those who denigrate new poetry, besides the "ancient fans" mentioned by Peng Xiaoshu earlier, surprisingly include some playwrights. Ding Xilin satirized new poetry in his one-act play "Only a Hornet," but it seems to have faded with time and is no longer noticed. More recently, A Ying's "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain" used the character Professor Ni to praise his lover Feng Yun with several "bad poems," and recently, Feng Zhizhong's adapted play "Putting on Airs" contained a long segment mocking new poetry, doing so in a very pretentious way. However (a very powerful "however"), new poetry still exists majestically despite being stung by a hornet. Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain only disturbed people's hearts temporarily. As for Putting on Airs, it only makes people feel artificial and hypocritical.</p>
<p>I remember R.L. Stevenson once said, "I often suspect that public taste is a mixed product, a combination of adherence to tradition and hypocrisy." The contemptuous attitude of the traditionalists towards new poetry is precisely because their adherence to tradition is too deep. As for the writers who satirize new poetry, it is only because they lack a deep understanding and study of new poetry. They either do not read new poetry or only superficially sample it. Both groups have not entered the door and are vulgar people, not worthy of discussing poetry. "Shuoshi Guankui" said, "Good poetry is the medicine of vulgar people." I also share the same view that these "vulgar-minded" people must eliminate their discriminatory mentality and read more collections of new poetry.</p>
<p>Perhaps the playwrights who satirize new poetry do not have malicious intentions. Using a little satire in the play is like a drugstore advertisement, just to attract more audiences. For example, the poem written in Feng Zhizhong's "Putting on Airs" (quotation marks are unnecessary): "Ah, ah, ah! I carelessly glanced at you, and your two light bulb-like eyes stole my heart. Thief, thief!" (I remembered this from the actors' lines at the Sino-French Drama Society, there may be mistakes.) He inserted this passage into the play, perhaps using incongruous words to elicit laughter from the audience. If so, then we must also demand a sound artistic conscience from the author.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must also introspect and examine the existing new poetry scene. Of course, we cannot deny that many new poems do have defects and are immature. Years of snail-like evolution will indeed make people who love to watch the excitement anxious. However, I always believe that immaturity is not enough to criticize new poetry. There is still plenty of time, and great things are always late to mature. (As long as you don't die young, you will always see its flourishing season.) Moreover, in new literature, whether it is prose, novels, or dramas, they all suffer from the same symptoms. Who can say that Cao Yu's "Sunrise" or Lu Xun's "Wandering" and "Call to Arms" are better than Sun Yutang's long poem "Baoma" of eight hundred lines? Here, I, like Mr. Xunmei, want to use Mr. Yutang's tone to say: "The success of new literature is also the success of new poetry."</p>
<p>The reason why new poetry is not popular in new literature, according to people, is: "We only have people who write new poetry, but no people who read new poetry." Editors of any magazine always feel that new poetry has the most submissions, while all booksellers feel that poetry journals and collections have the fewest sales. The existence of this deformed phenomenon, in my estimation, is due to two points: one is that poets are mostly self-admiring and do not promote themselves. The best poets are usually the worst advertisers. Moreover, poets have their own complete personality and noble tastes, and they will never cater to the masses and carefully compromise. The other point is that those engaged in literature and art or poetry critics lack sympathy and encouragement. This ruthless criticism and cold satire are usually the tricks of snobs.</p>
<p>Finally, we must thank those who mock new poetry, because "satire is a well-intentioned friend," as Churchill said. At the same time, we must also advise those who ridicule new poetry, because Bacon said well: "Those who have the habit of satirizing others and making people afraid of their sharp wit must make people remember them forever."</p>

<p>— Mingzhi</p>
<p>—The Story of Grandma—</p>
<p>Orders came down from above to attack Qingzhen.</p>
<p>Originally, we were in the business of attacking, so upon receiving orders, we should naturally proceed. However, Captain Wang Mingyuan and several other captains, after discussing the matter, couldn't help but hesitate. The reason was that we didn't know the actual situation in Qingzhen and couldn't make complete arrangements, so we couldn't rashly go. I said, "This matter can only be solved by asking Grandma."</p>
<p>As soon as I thought of Grandma, everyone laughed. "Okay, go and invite Grandma right away," Wang Mingyuan said.</p>
<p>Grandma didn't know what she was doing, she patted her clothes and came out from inside.</p>
<p>"Are you familiar with Qingzhen?" Wang Mingyuan asked.</p>
<p>"Very familiar; I have a nephew who lives in that town."</p>
<p>"Do you know how many 'people,' how many guns, and how many cannons there are in Qingzhen now?"</p>
<p>"I don't know about that."</p>
<p>"Do you have a way to find out?"</p>
<p>Grandma thought for a moment, nodded and said, "I have a way; give me three days to reply, okay?"</p>
<p>After agreeing on this, she went to prepare, seemingly busy all night. The next day, she carried several bags of things alone and went to the home of her nephew Qian Asen.</p>
<p>She said to Qian Asen that the family had no pocket money lately and wanted to come to town to do some small business. She poured out the things in the bags, and Qian Asen saw that they were various kinds of edible broad beans. Qian Asen didn't take it to heart, because such things were commonly done by genuine country old women.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, she borrowed a shallow large basket from Qian Asen, put various beans in it, and went to the street to sell them. She had already found out that the place where those (people) were stationed was the Public Silk Cocoon Guild, so she went straight to the big teahouse opposite the guild.</p>
<p>She made a brief circle in the teahouse, sold some beans, and then limped to the window facing the street, staring at the gate of the cocoon guild without leaving.</p>
<p>There were people standing guard at the entrance of the cocoon guild, and many people were going in and out. She stared intently, as if looking for an acquaintance. Sometimes someone called her to buy beans, and she almost forgot.</p>
<p>"Why don't you do business, old woman, and just stare at the opposite side?" said someone among the tea guests.</p>
<p>"Country people rarely see strange things, so they have to appreciate them," someone answered for her.</p>
<p>"That's right," she said, seeing someone talking to her, and quickly responded, "We country people really rarely see them. I wonder how many 'people' there are here?"</p>
<p>"Not many, I guess; I don't pay much attention." It was an indifferent and irresponsible reply.</p>
<p>She looked at the window for a long time, and finally noticed a person. This person was nearly forty years old, with a dark red face, wearing short clothes, and looked like a farmer. He had entered and exited several times. Each time he came out, his hands were empty, and when he went in, he had something in his hands, indicating that he was also a servant. Just as she was considering going downstairs, this person walked into the teahouse and came upstairs. She was overjoyed and made her preparations.</p>
<p>As soon as the man came upstairs, he unhesitatingly went to a seat by the window and sat down. As soon as the tea server saw him seated, he brought tea to him without waiting for him to open his mouth.</p>
<p>"Would you like some spiced beans?" Grandma walked to his table as if casually.</p>
<p>"No," he said, taking a sip of tea.</p>
<p>"Then the fried yellow beans are crispier." She pointed to the basket.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll have some fried yellow beans." He looked at the basket.</p>
<p>When Grandma heard this, she grabbed two handfuls and put them in front of him, and smiled and looked at his face and said:</p>
<p>"I seem to recognize you; where do you live?"</p>
<p>"I live in Li's Bridge." As he said this, he also looked at Grandma, saw that she was a rural old woman in her sixties, her clothes were old but clean, her face was full of spring breeze, her manner was amiable, as if she was really an acquaintance. "I also seem to recognize you," he couldn't help but add.</p>
<p>"Oh, Li's Bridge. My mother's family is in Li's Bridge." Grandma's voice was excited. "What's your name?"</p>
<p>"My name is Li Jingen."</p>

<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>When lonely, the coldness in my heart can't help but bring about empty sorrows of fantasy, as if falling into the deep seam of the earth, dropping into a bottomless abyss.</p>
<p>A chill runs through me, stirring quiet thoughts.</p>
<p>I want to sing, sing a song without sound.</p>
<p>I remember (actually a beautiful and moving lie) how many years ago, heaven and earth were the same, and there was no distinction between humans and gods. The spring breeze was like a wisp of light smoke, drifting in the air to form the image of a goddess – do you believe it? Do you believe there really was peace on earth?</p>
<p>Friend, don't be silly! Besides the goddess, you should also know that there are devils. Devils, yes, devils can also be arrogant for a time before sunset. They will trample on the image of the goddess and smash the monument of peace. But you should also understand: the sun rises from the east, and although its power is overwhelming at noon, it finally sets in the west.</p>
<p>I also remember the scenery I loved to see most when I was young – the sunset on the lake.</p>
<p>It's Xuanwu Lake. Through the gaps in the willow branches, in the red clouds, I saw a bloody wheel sinking under the bricks and stones of the Terrace City. At that time, the color of the lake, the air of the lake, the rhythm of the lake, formed a landscape painting under Apollo's pen.</p>
<p>It's also Beihai. In the corridor in front of Yilan Hall, on the shore of Fangshan, and to the left and right of the Five Dragon Pavilions, I have left a shallow mark. Now it is May again, and the beautiful scenery of the sunset is coming into season again. In the deep seams of the earth, in the bottomless abyss, I pick up a piece of memory. Nanjing and Beiping, although not my hometowns, are still familiar homelands. It's worth taking a trace of interest from this memory and leaving it on my eyeballs and nerves to rely on when I'm lonely.</p>
<p>I want to sing, sing a song with a faint sound.</p>
<p>But I faintly hear a bass note, chanting the power of life.</p>
<p>Look, a patch of blue floats in the sky – it's a stardust sprinkled by the goddess on the blue sky – it's a strand of soft hair on the head of the universe – it's the source of life between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>When I recall the beautiful sunset scenery that I enjoyed watching in the old days, I smile. In my imagination, the sun floats on the water, drifting with a light and cheerful melody. Through the water's surface, in the depths of the swamp, there are also traces of devils, sinking to the bottom.</p>
<p>Isn't it, although the sun's power is overwhelming at noon, it finally sets in the west.</p>
<p>I want to sing, sing a song without sound.</p>
<p>But a chill runs through me, stirring quiet thoughts. I look up and see a patch of blue in the sky again, that eternal beauty.</p>

<p>Everything ferments in the moist, cloudy weather; new aspirations are still buried in unseen gaps; it's not the darkness before dawn, it's still far from the dawn!</p>
<p>A little bird is bound by the cruel web threads, struggling desperately as the express train of news reports rushes through every gap. It will give itself a golden, achievable illusion.</p>
<p>A gust of wind came, from the distant sky; it blew open the package of the golden dream, and seeds of joy jumped out from within.</p>
<p>The illusion did not turn into a bubble, it was imprinted with a knowing smile deep in the vortex.</p>
<p>All the haze will be completely destroyed; there is some light in the east, bringing active sounds. The light of the morning illuminates the congested heart and inspires the mind. It is a great time – shoulder to shoulder, in the new torrent, new calls resound. (Fundraising for Charity)</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>I think that the deliberate use of awkward new poetry by playwrights cannot be said to be intentional "denigration" of new poetry, because on the one hand, playwrights do sometimes use this trick to "win the audience's laughter," which is harmless, and on the other hand, some new poems are indeed prone to clichés, so it is okay to satirize them, as mentioned in the play. I don't see these playwrights deliberately "denigrating" the entire new poetry movement. However, Mr. Guangzu's opinion is also very reasonable. New poetry is one of the important gains of the New Literature Movement and should not be destroyed, so I am happy to publish it. I hope this won't cause any disputes, because everyone is originally a faithful believer in the New Literature Movement.</p>

<p>(See the May issue of this newspaper in the eleventh year of the reign of Tongzhi of the late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Sanlintang is located in Pudong, bordering Kunlian in the county of Nanhui. The river project is a total of 2,974 zhang long. Large dams have been built on both the east and west sides, and dredging began yesterday. The funds are obtained through a surtax: 2 wen per bolt of cloth, 20 wen per stone of rice, 10 wen per bale of cotton, 40 wen per pig, and surtaxes on southern goods stores, dye houses, and pharmacies are levied daily based on the size of the shop, ranging from 15 to 40 wen. The county has also initiated donations of 300,000 cash. The supervising committee for this project consists of candidates Gao Er and Yin Yuanxun. The directors are Tang Dezeng, Qiao Yongxiu, Zhao Zeng, Shen Xueshi, and Zhou Dunfu. The short notice issued by Magistrate Ye is recorded below: "The Sanlintang River in this area has been dammed and dredging has begun. Each 15 mu of land is required to provide one worker. If the client does not have a worker, they must hire one. The dredging costs must not be considered insignificant. Work must begin at dawn and end at dusk. The water is shallow at the bottom of the river, so the first priority is to deepen them uniformly. The excavated soil must be placed beyond 10 zhang and must not be dumped for convenience. This is a special and earnest warning, and it must not be regarded as a mere formality."</p>

<p>There is a thatched shed in Xiaguan, set up by Jardine Matheson as a waiting area for passengers boarding Yangtze River steamers, providing accommodation until the ship arrives. It is only a few dozen paces away from the Fireworks Camp. On the fourth day of the month, thirty to forty passengers were sitting around their luggage. In the middle of the night, there was a very urgent door-knocking. At first, it was said to be a fire, but then it was a robbery. Chests were overturned, and many people were injured by knives during the struggle. Some passengers escaped through holes in the wall to seek help from the Fireworks Camp. After a long time, they finally agreed to send troops, but the robbers had already dispersed. During the robbery, one of the robbers said, "If you want to ask me, I'm in the Fireworks Camp!" It is said that there were patrols and sentries in the camp at night. The robbers were only seven people, yet they were so bold as to kill and set fire at the gate of the camp. The situation must be thoroughly investigated.</p>

<h3 id="e129">The Origin of Tobacco and Discussions on Water Pipes <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Water Pipe Industry Association recently published a notice regarding the issue of counterfeit water pipes. It elaborates on the origins of water pipes and their benefits, even claiming that Prime Minister Zhuge Liang of the Han Dynasty used *yaoyunxiang* grass during his campaign against Meng Huo, which was later transferred to the Lanzhou area of Gansu, becoming the origin of water pipes. However, I dare not definitively confirm this. According to old notes, tobacco entered China from places like Little Luzon during the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty, called "淡巴菰 (Dan Ba Gu)," a transliteration of "Tobacco," undoubtedly imported from foreign lands. However, it doesn't state that China had no tobacco production before the import of 담바고. What can be asserted is that the habit of smoking gradually rose during the late Ming Dynasty, and from the early Qing Dynasty to the present, it has become increasingly prevalent. As the saying goes, "Little Tartars knock on the tide of tobacco," indicating the popularity of smoking after the Manchus entered the pass.</p>
<p>The old tobacco was mostly of the dry tobacco type, with bamboo poles used as pipes. A hole was dug at one end to insert the tobacco, and the other end was used for smoking. The pipe was very short, able to be hidden at the waist. The ash was knocked out of the pipe after smoking. The tobacco was cut into strands and kept in a pouch. Manchus wore pouches at their waists, originally used for storing dry food during hunting, and also for storing tobacco. Later, the pouch became a prized decorative item for the Qing imperial family, losing its original purpose.</p>
<p>How do we know that the habit of smoking became prevalent in the early Qing Dynasty? We can tell from the word "prohibition." Whenever a new habit arises and becomes commonplace, attracting the attention of the authorities, they inevitably issue prohibitions. However, prohibitions often prove ineffective, instead promoting its prevalence. Records of smoking increased during the early Qing Dynasty: such as Chen Yuanlong, the Minister of the State of Hai'ning, and Shi Yizhi, the Minister of the State of Liyang, both were known for smoking at the time. Legend says that both men were avid smokers of 淡巴菰, unable to let it go. Emperor Shengzu of Qing detested this. During a southern tour, he stayed in Dezhou and specifically gifted them crystal pipes. The two men were delighted and used them to smoke, but the flames shot straight into their throats, causing them to choke severely. Fearing this, they dared not smoke again. Kangxi then issued a ban on smoking throughout the country. Academician Jiang Chenxi had a poem recording this event:</p>
<p>Jade bowls and jade liquor rinsed open with splendor, a prohibition on deep cups had already been announced at the feast.</p>
<p>The Jade Pond banquet ended, cloud screens were opened, forbidding human smoke from entering.</p>
<p>Although there was a prohibition, those who smoked still smoked. Those addicted would rather go hungry, and there were those who had to smoke. For example, when Liu Lun, the Duke Wending of Wujin, was down on his luck, he was so poor that he had nothing to eat. He begged tobacco from his neighbor with a bamboo pipe. The neighbor advised him, "Tobacco aids digestion, don't smoke too much." The Duke smiled and accepted it.</p>
<p>At the time, people believed that tobacco could aid digestion, so the neighbor laughed at him for still being fond of tobacco even when he had nothing to eat.</p>
<p>Even more proof that tobacco was prevalent despite Kangxi's ban is the story of Ji Da's large pipe.</p>
<p>Ji Da's large pipe refers to Ji Xiaolan, Duke Wenda. Ji enjoyed smoking, and his pipe was very large. One pipe of tobacco would last from his residence to the palace gates. Ji once served in the Imperial Study. One day, he was summoned by Emperor Qianlong. Ji thought the conversation would be brief, so he hastily stuffed the pipe into his boot before entering. Unexpectedly, the conversation lasted a long time, and the burning tobacco inside the boot scorched his skin. Ji looked restless and uneasy. Emperor Gaozong found this strange and asked him. Ji told the truth, saying, "Water has entered my boot." Gaozong waved him away. "Water in the boot" is probably unprecedented.</p>
<p>The making of water pipes also appeared during the Qianlong era. The Qianlong era was the golden age of the Qing Dynasty. Luxury and enjoyment knew no bounds. The change from dry tobacco to water pipes likely occurred at this time. The transition from dry tobacco to water pipes was an advancement in the art of smoking. Dry tobacco pipes at most used copper for the bowl, and ivory or metal for the mouthpiece. Water pipes were made entirely of metal, shiny and clean, firstly; the smoke was filtered through water, making the taste mild, secondly; and a servant could load the pipe, thirdly. How do we know that it was prevalent during the Qianlong era? Because Cao Ge's request was granted in October of the forty-first year of Qianlong to ban water pipes. And how do we know that it wasn't popular before then? We can observe the "Dream of the Red Chamber," which recorded events from the Yongzheng to the early Qianlong eras. Smoking isn't often seen in "Dream of the Red Chamber." Only in the 101st chapter does Xue Baochai ask Fengjie for a pipe of tobacco. This "pipe of tobacco" was likely dry tobacco. If water pipes already existed at the time, the extravagant Jia family would definitely have had them. Moreover, Jia Mu, Wang Furen, and the others did not smoke. Only snuff, which had entered from the West, is mentioned in the book. At that time water pipes seemed to not be something ordinary people could enjoy. Even among officials, there was a hierarchy between dry tobacco and water pipes. During the years of Xianfeng eight and nine, Wang Youling was promoted by He Guiqing, the Governor-General of Liangjiang. In a few years, he went from a jail warden to the Jiangsu Provincial Administration Commissioner, relying heavily on the Governor-General and despising the Governor. The Governor Zhao Dezhe resigned due to illness, and was succeeded by Xu Youren, the Hunan Provincial Administration Commissioner. Xu knew of Wang's arrogance and sought to curb him. When Wang went to pay his respects, two handsome servants each held a white copper pipe, preparing and sending water tobacco. Xu said to him, "You have risen to the position of Provincial Commissioner, yet you don't know the customs of officialdom? When a Provincial Commissioner visits the Governor, only dry tobacco is allowed, not water tobacco. Although you are extraordinarily talented, the rules cannot be ignored!" He waved the two handsome servants away. Wang was caught off guard and left dejected. It can be seen that there was a clear hierarchy associated with water pipes at that time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the notice mentions the benefits of water pipes, and I deeply admire its points. I used to enjoy smoking water pipes in my early years, and later also smoked cigarettes. In the past eight years, I have quit both. In my view, smoking water pipes is indeed the most hygienic method of smoking. The harms of smoking are: firstly, the heat directly affects the throat, causing frequent throat ailments. The reason I painfully quit my 27-year smoking habit was precisely because of a hoarse throat at the time; secondly, the toxic nicotine is inhaled into the lungs and brain, easily causing harm. However, with water pipes, the smoke is filtered through water, dissolving some of the toxins, reducing the harmful substances. During the late Qing Dynasty, Mr. Qi created a hygienic dry tobacco pipe based on the principle of the water pipe. A spiral was placed inside the pipe, causing the smoke to pass through the spiral's coils, cooling and adhering to the spiral, reducing the direct impact of toxins on the throat. Mr. Qi also praised the advancement of water pipes in smoking, saying that foreign cigarettes have their convenience but lack hygiene. Unfortunately, water pipes are less convenient to carry; secondly, the tobacco residue is spat all over the ground, easily causing uncleanliness; thirdly, smoking water pipes in a modern office is not as easily concealed as cigarettes in terms of style. In reality, if the true meaning of smoking is considered, who knows if one day water pipes might be considered the most appropriate smoking tool again. Comparing water pipes and cigarettes is nothing more than considering fashion versus unfashionable, convenience versus inconvenience. These two points are not the fundamental reasons for the failure of water pipes.</p>

<p>Chapter 10: A Mother of Virtue and Talent with a Bun and Blue Skirt; A Vigorous Old Man with a Silver Beard and Emerald Sleeves</p>
<p>Today, when Zhu Ai’s car arrived, we had already heard the two honks of the horn. We were familiar with this honking, and we knew it was Ai’s car. Village Chief Zhu was at home today because it was Sunday. Usually, he would go to the elementary school in the morning and the village office in the afternoon, keeping him busy all day. He was sitting under his own vine trellis, basking in the sun, when he learned that his granddaughter had arrived. His granddaughter was usually unreserved, but today she had brought two classmates with her, so we had to act as good hosts. Therefore, he ordered Zhu Ai's wife to greet them. Mrs. Zhu knew that there would be guests at home today, and that they would be staying for dinner, so she had been busy all morning. Although there were others in the house helping, Mrs. Zhu still took care of everything herself, to her heart’s content. At this moment, having just taken off her white apron, she followed Zhu Ai's wife out. Ai introduced her mother and her cousin to the two Misses He. The two Misses He first shook hands with Zhu Ai, seeing that she was a healthy and family-oriented woman. When she spoke, she also seemed very frank and cheerful. Upon seeing Mrs. Zhu, they saw a middle-aged woman in plain clothes. She was entirely clad in cloth, and not a single piece of silk fabric could be seen. She hadn’t cut her hair, but had pulled it up high into a small bun that looked very neat. Originally, Mrs. Zhu had not always kept her hair. When Village Chief Zhu was a guerilla leader, Mrs. Zhu had also joined the medical team. She was a strong and capable woman, and the medical team welcomed her. Women are generally weaker than men, but not Mrs. Zhu. For instance, if two people couldn’t lift a wounded soldier, Mrs. Zhu could carry him alone. She had not cut her hair originally, but because she worked day and night in the medical team, she didn’t have time to get a haircut. After about ten days, her hair would be messy and would smell. Mrs. Zhu liked to be neat, and because she couldn’t keep her hair clean, she simply ignored it. She would take a pair of scissors and cut it off at the roots, then wash it with clean water – wasn’t that much faster than having long hair? Her cutting her hair was very different in intention from women who cut their hair for beauty. Later, when times became peaceful, she grew her hair out again, which was also her own freedom. The two Misses He saw how simple Mrs. Zhu was, and they felt a deep respect for her. They thought that this woman, who was said to be a peasant and had not received much education, seemed to possess a kind of wisdom that was beyond the knowledge of the educated.</p>

<p>— Qihua</p>
<p>“Blackwell's Island”</p>
<p>Regardless of GIMAN's extraordinary intelligence and courage, or the detective network's intricate arrangement, the existence of evil forces in society grows proportionally with them; even in gold-standard countries, those explicit films are the most powerful evidence. As for how to completely eliminate the growth of these evil forces? That is a question beyond "observations."</p>
<p>The gang leader Bull Burnhamson in "I Enter Hell" is in collusion with politicians. Even when the evidence of his crimes is solid and he is sentenced to prison, he can move freely in and out of prison due to his special influence, and even usurp the authority of the prison warden. Although the playwright claims that these characters are fictional, why fabricate these characters to create "I Enter Hell"? Perhaps this is precisely "to cover up is to reveal"!</p>
<p>News reporter Tim Hayden not only wrote articles in newspapers, sparing no effort in criticizing evil forces, but also deliberately committed a crime to go to prison in order to verify the gangster's tyranny in prison and collect evidence. This fearless spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" is exactly what journalists in this time and place should deeply reflect on.</p>
<p>John Caffarel and Ruthmary Land are both new faces among the "Four Thousand Golden Boys." I think John is more suitable for playing villains; here, he is just a qualified reporter. Ruthmary Land has too few scenes, only a few shots. The director is mediocre.</p>

<p>Songs, poems, lyrics, and odes scatter fragrance. The spring night is sad, sitting until the screen is exhausted.</p>
<p>If it weren't that the nine provinces share calamities, who would listen to the smashing of coral?</p>

<p>Only the empty king understands the weary people. One can truly see the small grass in the Yuanzhi plant.</p>
<p>The Spring and Autumn Annals' biased pen should not write too much. What can be done about my scattered disciples?</p>
<p>It's hard to pull proportions from historians. Tao Qian's poems like to talk about Jing Ke.</p>
<p>It's hard to dispel the twilight feelings at the banquet. I have no fortune to row a boat on the Qinhuai River.</p>
<p>I also watch the old trees in the mountains. The prime of life and energy are exhausted by nine points.</p>
<p>The horse carriages in the western suburbs are all used up. Not as good as chicken pine's endurance to the cold.</p>
<p>The water is exhausted, the mountain's meaning is deep. The nature of the common people, ancient and modern, is still the same.</p>

<p>Writing books is all for a means of livelihood. Frugal bellies and lofty talks worry me.</p>
<p>If, by chance, I drift into the sea of literature, there will be a small Spring and Autumn in the southeast.</p>

<p>Ten thousand records, no one lifts a pen. The bamboos east of the villa want to connect to the sky.</p>
<p>A hundred years of heart's desires return to plainness. I want to restrain my wildness and gradually turn to Chan.</p>
<p>I come again to Xiao Temple to ask about the years. I can't bear the fleeting flowers of the human world.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Small Cinemas Should Be Polite to Customers <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Buwen</p>
<p>On May 10th, this newspaper published a news item titled "Guanghua Cinema Investigator Angers Customer with International Espionage." It stated: "The investigator forcibly dragged the customer, an old man, who argued strongly. Afterwards, he shouted arrogantly, angering other customers, and attempted to drag him again, with everyone voicing their discontent." The words reveal the investigator's abuse of power, provoking the customer's reaction. This matter is difficult to judge, who is right and who is wrong? Let's not discuss it for now, but it is safe to say that the investigator had no respect for customers and lacked basic manners. I have previously visited the cinema because of its proximity, only to find a crowd of people pushing and shoving to buy tickets, and the ticket sales were very slow. When I finally squeezed near the window, I was almost told it was sold out. Fortunately, I managed to get a ticket, but I still had to stand and wait, anxiously waiting for the opening of the curtain, enduring the smell of sweat and body odor, which was difficult to bear, but I couldn't retreat. The guards, two or three of them, all looked fierce and arrogant, like the jailers of the underworld, looking down on everyone, as if they were the only ones who mattered. What I don't understand is, generally people are tempted by the "cheap price" and come from afar, why do they willingly accept such humiliation? It seems that in the minds of these employees, under the power of "cheap price," the word "courtesy" is absolutely ineffective? Therefore, the fundamental mistake lies here. When the curtain is raised, customers rush in, causing chaos, and the weak are often unable to enter, and women and children are knocked over or pushed around. This shows the improper handling of the cinema.</p>
<p>There is another cinema that can be called a sibling of "Guanghua." The ticket collectors, investigators, and tea servers all lack courtesy and share the same disease of insulting customers. I often see unnecessary disputes arising during ticket collection and ticket verification, as if "cheap price" is equivalent to providing relief, and customers are regarded as refugees. One evening, I also visited once. In front of my seat was a female customer with a two- or three-year-old child. When collecting tickets, the investigator insisted on her buying another ticket. The female customer argued that the child was not occupying a seat and refused to buy a ticket. Then I saw the tea server cursing rudely by the side, and the investigator questioned her repeatedly, finally saying that this place doesn't allow "free shows," insulting the female customer. At the time, I felt very indignant, but because the tea server was there to back him up and was too rude, I was afraid of being wronged in front of him. Today, I saw the news about Guanghua published in the newspaper, and I know that the root cause of the disturbances has been around for a long time. I am now attaching the observation of certain cinema staff insulting customers here. I have no grievances with these cinemas. In fact, based on what I have seen and heard, I am giving sincere advice. Although the scale is small and the ticket price is cheap, there should be no lack of courtesy. After all, customers are the target of business, and it is essential to be polite, which aligns with commercial ethics. Whether it is adopted or sounds unpleasant, you can observe the future order of the cinema to verify that my words are not false. (Charity Sale)</p>

<p>Charlie Chaplin, the master of the silver screen, has not been seen producing new works for a long time. Recently, Mr. Chaplin, in view of the fact that dictators of many ambitious countries arbitrarily humiliate small nations and disregard justice and reason, has decided to personally star in the film "The Dictator." The main idea of the film is to depict a wandering beggar who is imprisoned in a German concentration camp. Later, because the beggar's appearance is very similar to that of the current German leader Hitler, some nervous friends mistake him for Hitler and release him from prison. Afterwards, he takes advantage of the situation and creates many hilarious jokes.</p>
<p>Since the news of Chaplin's production of "The Dictator" was transmitted to the Soviet Union, they resolved to award him the Medal of Honor. The Soviet Supreme Command ordered that all theaters across the country uniformly screen Chaplin's films for a week from the day of Chaplin's 50th birthday to commemorate him, because Mr. Chaplin is not only an artist in Hollywood, USA, but also a powerful person who uses films to resist capitalism and the bourgeoisie. His broken boots, bowler hat, and old cane are really the best magic weapons to overthrow authoritarian politics and consolidate democratic politics, so all people in countries that love freedom and peace should pay him the most respect.</p>

<p>In the present situation in which the fascists of all the Shepherd Relief Refugees in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres are carrying out aggressive wars, thousands of innocent people are sacrificed under their tools, and more people are also reduced to refugees because of the devastation. Righteous people from all over the world have seen this unprecedented catastrophe and are all providing material resources and giving human sympathy.</p>
<p>Hollywood's Columbia Film Company has also sent photographers and reporters to various parts of China to film the complicated books of refugees and the situation of displacement, using the camera eye to replace telecommunications, which is naturally more real and can evoke human sympathy. Columbia Company has now specially filmed a short film called "Refugees." The entire film is a song, accompanied by war photos and refugee images taken from all over the place: and it is made into English, Chinese, German. Spanish and Jewish copies of the species. The film begins with subtitles explaining that the purpose of the production of the film is only to express sympathy to the victims of war from all over the world and has no political ideology. In the future, when it is screened, all income will be used to help refugees.</p>

<p>Yong'an Pharmaceutical Company has pleaded for the lives of the victims, and Mr. Guo Linmai, general manager of Yong'an Company, personally took the stage to star. I'm pleased to have this opportunity, and I took a special car to watch. I'm reporting the impressions I gained in a brief report.</p>
<p>(1) The scripts of "Five Barbarian Lovers" and "The Story of Jing Ke" are both based on the masses and have a very profound meaning. The screenwriter, Mr. Mai Youyun, put a lot of effort into making this masterpiece. It is truly a special new discovery in the world of drama.</p>
<p>(2) Talents: The company has a wealth of talent, such as Guo Lingshuang, Tang Guanpeng, Mai Youyun, Zhong Fenghua, Guo Yong, Luo Huitang, Feng Yongkang, etc., all of whom are outstanding talents of the time, and the role assignment is extremely appropriate, so the performances are all competent, and director Yang Yetang has worked hard.</p>
<p>(3) Acting: These two plays are both ancient costume plays, and the expression is entirely in the details. Each character plays the role of the person in the play, and the acting is skilled, making people unexpectedly satisfied now. This is not an exaggeration, because the facts are like this, such as in the play "Five Barbarian Lovers," Guo Lingshuang plays the protagonist Fan Li, and he conveys the masculine spirit of a strong man and the gentle state of children in different situations, and is truly a master of expression. And Miss Zhong Fenghua plays Xi Shi, and her singing and acting skills are very stable, and her costume is gorgeous, which is especially lifelike. Others, such as Yuan Wenshao playing the dignified role of Wu Zixu, have all reached the realm of transformation. (Charity Sale)</p>

<p>Big Li Wu's Mischief</p>
<p>Some of the most annoying children, along with those who specialize in eavesdropping on news and being busybodies, all followed behind the stove, as if admiring a procession of someone riding a wooden stove. More and more people gathered, almost obstructing traffic. Later, the police saw this and reprimanded him, saying he deliberately put makeup on his stove to parade it through the streets, violating police regulations, and nearly took him to the police station. He was exhausted, angry, ashamed, and wronged, and cursed Big Li Wu all the way. After a few days, he thought of a way to get revenge.</p>
<p>One day, Big Li Wu was performing in "Robbing the Peach, King Mu of Heaven." He played Yang Liulang in the play. After Yang Liulang's appearance, he deliberately clung to the person reporting the news, chatting endlessly, preventing him from going on stage. Li Shunting was sitting on stage, waiting for the messenger to report the news of Zongbao's capture, so he could grab his horse and rush to Mukezhai. Who knew that the messenger had been detained by Boss Yu, and the people who had been teased by Big Li Wu before all tacitly ignored him, and no one urged him. Li Shunting sat on the stage, waiting and waiting, but the messenger didn't come. Although he glanced at the stage entrance twice, there was still no movement. According to the old rules of the play, the people on stage were not allowed to call to the backstage for no reason. Moreover, the messenger was someone who left the military camp to gather information outside, of course, different from the attendants who served the marshal. Big Li Wu usually had a belly full of bad ideas and was an extremely clever person, but today, he was caught off guard and tricked in this small detail, which caused the audience to shout "Bravo!" It can be seen that those who like to make fun of others will also have embarrassing moments. Fortunately, Li Wu was experienced and able to calm himself down. He thought to himself that staying stiff on the stage was not a solution, so he quickly composed a few lines: "It's this late, and still no scout has arrived. Come, bring the horse!" He used this to step down. (12)</p>
