<p>社評</p>
<h3>西班牙與遠東</h3>
<p>三數日前，倫敦泰晤士報駐東京記者，當就美英法三國對日送致尊重九國公的之强硬照會後，日本方面所生反應，作概括報吿。其言略謂：日本殆將不得不放棄其某種幻想；然彼在華軍事旣有若千勝利，復有鑒於全能諸國在歐洲之舉動，不無所得，則自有其所憧憬者矣。所稱日本行將放棄之幻想，究何所指，爲原電所未詳；察之日本首相平沼與外相有田輩，日前在彼國會所發表之演說，本報曾評之爲空虛浮泛，毫無新提示；顧較之三國照會前日本迭决之表示，執迷依然亦可謂爲毫無新覺悟；則謂日本不得不放棄某種幻想者，固猶無可徵信也。更證以最近數日情報，謂日本在太原與台灣，方事組織巨量新軍，予以特殊訓練，專爲應付中國游擊戰之用；而晋西鄂西粵西前綫，於久經沉寂之後，近日日軍顯有準備再取攻勢之跡象；於是觀之，三國以外交行動應付遠東瘋在侵略，將無殊於目覩鄰居遭殺人放火之劇盜，流彈橫飛，火燄四竄，而示之以徒手體操而已。謂係過甚其辭，西班牙事固殷鑒也。</p>
<p>西班牙共和政府與國民軍勢力之消長，直接影響及於英法者，本報昨日社評，論之已詳，即跨大西洋而在美國，亦感受國民軍勝後之異常威脅，此則前昨二日之美國輿情，旣透露無餘蘊矣。夫伺以政府軍形勢日非，有如今茲？則不干涉政策重爲之魔，於是封鎖邊界焉，禁運軍火焉，堅壁淸野，以待燎原。謂英法美三國初料不及此。則明察秋毫而不見輿薪之類，不可信也。應救不救，可救不救；及至今日有急轉直下之觀，幾何其不及救矣！於是相顧失色，議聲援焉，議解禁焉；明知禍及眉睫，惶惶然惟恐不復能獨善其身，而翹然日我必有以自保也。我人未聞世有戰略，可以坐視前綫淪陷而僅設防於大本營之戶限者；顧英法美對於西班牙問題之政策，則此戰略之類也。</p>
<p>英法美是吾恍然於片面不干涉之失着？是吾瞿然於唇亡齒寒，休戚攸共而援西班牙共和政府？非所逆覩。及至今日而猶僅以解禁爲援西，是吾可挽頹勢？亦難預卜。而頃傳柏林電訊，謂德國報紙則認爲西班牙之運命，至是而註定矣！同時倫敦與巴黎方面所惓念者，却爲墨索里尼氏勝後撤兵，决不駐兵西境，覬覦西土之諾言。二者對比，能不爲西班牙「註定之運命」預掬同情之淚耶！抑或不必作如是觀，祗要英法美諸國及今急起直追，不難倒挽在瀾。理有可信，勢殆難能。蓋援西以今茲爲最後之時機，亦以今茲爲最壞之形勢；援於往昔，易如反掌，而時機逝矣；援於今茲，則所需力量殆必十百倍於往昔，謂同情之者備此犧牲，發此宏願乎？惟其如此，我人無可禱祝，惟禱墨索里尼氏不食諾言，以爲英法美祝福！</p>
<p>噬臍之悔，最可悲憫。於是我人應取西班牙問題爲殷鑑而論遠東。遠東目前情况之中，僅因西班牙事而留一黑影；即泰晤士報記者所謂日本憧憬於全能諸國在歐洲不無所獲，而目前西班牙可能之不幸，即全能國家之又一獲也；日本不將允見獵心喜乎？除此黑影，盡是光明。中國在天時，在地勢，在戰略；旣入有利階段；士氣民心，復再接再厲。日本筋疲力盡，更以一百萬萬之空前預算加諸人民；師老無功，軍心渙散，欲進不得，欲罷不能。國際則對華同情已深入民間，對日憎惡已達沸點。故一切環境，適與西班牙問題相反。申言之：今茲制日，則因利乘便，如摧枯，如拉朽。援華則以今茲爲最好之時機，亦最好之形勢。不若是而期待日本捐棄其幻想，惟有期待中國抗戰之勝利；顧休戚攸共何爲而任中國久於獨當其衝！</p>

<h3>粵海漁民一筆血賬　漁船被焚約近萬艘　漁民死傷超過十萬</h3>
<p>香港通訊、自日軍侵犯華南以來、粵省平民生命財產之捐失、固無法加以統計、而除此以外、廣東沿海各地漁民之慘遭焚殺、一年餘來、更無法詳加調查、而共數字之驚人、情狀之慘酷、决非一般所可想像、橡粵省沿海各地、漁產豐富、故貧苦人民之依漁撈爲生者、自潮汕以至粵南、爲數當在百萬以上、即以香港廣州附近各區而論、其數量亦在三四十萬左右、此輩漁民、平日生活之辛苦、自不待言、迨日軍艦封鎖中國海岸後、漁民出海捕魚、即被日軍慘殺、迄於今日、貧苦漁民之死於非命者、數逾鉅萬、此一筆血賬、當亦爲中國民衆、永永不忘也、</p>
<p>溯自粵省沿海遭封鎖後、一般漁民、不知利害、依然駕舟出海捕魚、有幸者未遇日艦、固能照常滿載而歸、不幸者爲日艦所遇、即連船帶人、扣於艦旁、侮辱毆打之餘、復將全船婦孺扣留、逼令男子至岸上代購糧食、有時且將私鹽私糖交與漁民、着其登岸售賣、以賣得之軟、購買糧食蔬菜而歸、設有不從、即將漁船焚燒、全船男女老幼悉數殺死、如此的經三月、事爲粵省沿海人民所知、均相率不賣糧食與一般可疑漁民、日艦見計已不售、乃於扣得漁船後、留下男子、逼令婦女上岸購糧、如此又經數月、沿海漁民、咸不敢冒險出海、或出海時、遙見日艦、即揚帆逃遁、日艦遂又開槍掃射、或以小汽艇追趕、趕到後、强姦婦女、毆辱壯丁、搜刦財物、無所不爲、至此、一般漁民、十九均不敢再往捕魚、其膽敢冒險出海者、往往一去不返、此爲去年初春之現象、</p>
<p>馴至春末夏初、日艦之活動於華南海面者、日見頻繁、而日本漁船、隨來公然盜漁、此時一般漁民因生活無着、乞援無門、勢難長此坐食、在迫於飢餓之下、祇得冒死出海工作、然一遇日艦或日漁船、必生慘劇、船中之人、無論老幼男女、均遭慘殺、船身則灌以火油、引火焚燒、有時且將漁民綁於船中、然後放火、將其活活燒死、慘不忍聞之慘劇、幾無日無之、其幸能泅水逃回者、百不得一、據非正式統計、自「八一三」迄今、潮汕粵南一帶大小漁船之被焚燬者、的近萬艘、漁民之死傷、超過十萬、其中死於海上者、至少有一二萬人、即以香港一地而論、香港漁民在附近海面捕魚、其船其人、在法律上實受英國之保護、但每遇日艦、燒殺之禍、亦未能倖免、有時日艦且侵入香港領海、焚船殺人、據香港漁民一協會最近報吿、過去十四個月內、香港漁民之被殺者、共計一千零九十二人、漁船被焚燬者六百二十八艘、財產損失約有八百萬之多、香港為華南沿海一極小之漁撈區、且有英國之保護、漁船漁民之慘遭焚殺者、即若是其多、其他各地、其慘毒情况、殊難令人想像也、</p>
<p>日軍侵犯華南以後、各地漁民之慘遭蹂躪、更加酷烈、及至日軍佔領廣州、日艦　集於大亞灣·大鵬灣·珠江口各海面、香港漁船、即在英屬領海界內工作、生命亦無保障、慘劇之生、日必數起、而萬千漁船、停泊港中、無數漁民、飢餓欲死、同時市上魚鮮來源斷絕、售價飛漲、問題之嚴重、顯而易見、當此之時、香港各報、忽然有香港當局爲救濟漁民生活與日軍訂一「紳士協定」之紀載、在此協定中、明白規定凡在港府登記之漁給及土生香港之漁民、出海捕魚、日艦不得干涉、但隨後香港當局即發表聲明、謂與日方簽訂「紳士協定」、並無其事、而多數漁船、仍不能出海捕魚、不過在此過程之中、（的在一個月前）香港附近、確無焚殺漁船之慘劇發生、但至最近、報上又時有漁船被焚之消息、每星期至少在二次以上、以此而觀、則香港當局與日方確未簽訂任何條的、</p>
<p>目下粵省沿海漁民、生活已陷絕境、過去粵省當局、雖擬救濟、並有將漁民移墾內地之議、然一因經費無着、一因辦理無人、不果施行、至於喧騰一時之武裝漁民、組織海上游擊隊運動、亦成泡影、目下潮汕及南路各地漁民、因終年不能出海、生活無着、兒啼女哭、自殺者有之、餓斃者亦有之、挺而走險或流爲乞丐者、爲數亦不在少、大小漁船、擱於沙灘之上、一任風雨之摧折、形同廢物、而若干漁民在忍無可忍之餘、、抱定以其餓死寗願被殺之决心、冒險出海、其能安然回歸者、幾不可聞、且此輩漁民與陸上難民不同、彼等旣無耕種經騐、又不善長途跋涉、如無當局爲之領導、作有計劃之遷移、則彼等祗有眼看海天、坐以待斃、其情乃殊慘也</p>

<p>據稱滇西邊地，自然條件極佳、山水秀麗、氣象雄偉、簡直不像夷方、氣候介在溫帶與熱帶之間、較之內地與南洋一帶均有過之、耕地則芒市·隴川·兩盆地與昆明不相上下、農作物如稻米·棉花·茶葉·菸草·菜物·等類、均可大規模種植、畜牧桑蠶等、更易發展、礦物豐富、且極便開發、當地土人技術幼稚、每日勞動不及四小時、而所得報酬遠在內地農民以上、其富有便利可以想見、人口每區不及一二萬、合上三區計算、僅六七萬人、故移運難民來此從事開發、實爲最好之理想地、且近公路完成、各地方均可暢達無阻、交通便利、隨地可到、對於移運、更無問題、惟該地瘴氣確相當利害、但若大規模開發、衛生設備、自不能免、故亦極易消滅、</p>
<p>民族問題</p>
<p>民族問題、該地本以民族複雜著稱、計共有擺夷·山頭·崩童·縹縹等四族中以山頭最野蠻慓悍、時出殺人掠刦、擺夷則秉性馴良、夷女之美、向爲人所顚倒、貞操觀念、較之漢族、可謂極其文明、卽在未嫁之前、可隨便追求異性、藉尋性之安慰、每於山頭嶺地、常見彼等足跡、以吹笛爲求愛之表示凡爲其所鍾者、則立求性慾之解决、父母絕不干預、但結婚之後、則絕對保守貞操、其於經濟生產、尤負重大責任、絕不倚靠男性、故絕無所謂輕女之風、此族若加以敎化、前途實無可限量、至於崩童·縹縹·不如擺夷山頭之大、且性亦馴良、更易於感化、實際上滇邊民族問題、實乃爲山滇路問題、但若敎導得法、亦不難使之感化、以其本性勇敢慓悍、訓練之爲抗戰將士、對於國家、更有莫大帮助、且該地接壤緬甸、於防衛邊疆上言、更有訓練之必要、</p>
<p>政治情形</p>
<p>滇邊各區、除主要縣份設縣治外、餘均爲設治局·土司、土司同土會、爲一地之主、勢力最大、故欺詐剝創、在所難免、且地處邊陲、交通不便、省府督責不易、弊病之多、實應徹底改革、</p>
<p>以上乃就該團考察觀感所及者、其詳細情形、當俟各項材料整理淸楚之後、現該團工作人員、除一部份仍留緬甸考察外、餘均已返省、各項材料、均在整理之中、一俟整理完竣、卽由林氏帶渝報吿、</p>

<h3>崑山偽縣署歛錢新策　塡平河流待價而沽　並利日軍汽車往還</h3>
<p>崑山通訊、崑山城內、河道紛岐、縱橫相通、或利於船舶往來、或便於飲水消防、蓋內地無自來水之設備、天然河流、爲都市唯一之大動脈也、自日軍侵略佔據崑山後、城中大街、瓦礫滿目、無人過問、偽組織忽異想天開、雇工將所有瓦礫、塡置城內各河流、首先實行者、爲中大街酒坊橋之兩旁河道業已塡滿、一旦火警發生、不知將何法應付、城中旣無公井、水源何來、此種作法自斃之政策、商人怵於淫威、敢怒而不敢言、次爲南街之河流、亦已有數處塡平、偽署並出有布吿、准許人民繳價購地、因南街一帶、向爲人烟稠密區域、地價昂貴、自不待言、今僞方如此劃策、以爲可增加不少收入、同時又擬塡平後浜河流、其用爲爲拓寬街道、便於日軍汽車往來、蓋日軍宜撫班在風車浜、往來縣府、必經後洪、恒以街道狹小爲憾、僞組織此舉、無非爲取媚日人之計、現有公民杜元善等、以此種辦法、實屬妨害公益、罔恤民艱、特聯名呈請僞知事、打消此議、尚不知結果何若也、</p>
<h3>天津漢奸發行偽報搖惑人心　勢血份子組織誅奸團　日軍檢查行人極嚴厲</h3>
<p>天津通信、日軍自佔據天津市後、對於英·法·兩租界、屢施高壓手設、致英法兩租界當局與日軍時生糾粉、最近日軍變本加厲、授意漢奸創辦日報、（江東日報即爲其一）刋載荒謬消息、廉價售諸英法兩租界內、以期麻醉人心、惟租界內熱血份子、爲抵制漢奸起見、亟以油印機秘密油印小型報紙、報吿抗戰眞實消息、以糾正僞方報紙之謬誤、而民衆購閱者、爭先恐後、同時又組織「誅奸團」、探訪漢奸行踪、初則寫信警吿、倘仍執迷不悟、則爲進一步之對付、</p>
<p>巿內日軍與漢奸、因中國熱血份子之活動、惶惴不安、遂更加嚴密檢査、凡由外埠開來之船隻、旣達大沽、必待日偽檢査員登船將船員船客逐一檢查、並騐明防疫證認爲無疑慮時、始許放行進口、英法兩租界與華界交通之處、僅爲一深長窄狹之甬道可通、道首有一日憲兵把守、並監視漢奸檢查出人行人、出入華界、雖無須通行證·防疫證、但須脫光衣襪、赤身裸體、不分男女、立於甬道、聽候共細細搜查、即鞋襪亦難免其搜視、在此冬季寒風凜冽之際、來往行人、赤身鵠立道上、無不戰慄不已、苟稍吐怨言、爲漢奸察覺、必被日兵拳打脚踢、行人受此虐待、唯有忍辱含羞、噤若寒蟬而已、至因體弱不勝寒冷而凍死道旁者、數亦不鮮、日軍與漢奸、又同時檢查民居，每於深更半夜、敲門搜入屋內、逕往臥室檢點人數、倘有不符、輕則被繫入獄、重則有性命之處、惟市郊之遊擊隊員、不因檢查之故而减少、常公然與日軍搏鬥、故每於夜深人靜、輒　斷續槍聲、突破沉寂、此即遊擊隊員之怒吼也、</p>
<h3>靖江日軍犯泰興不　湯家莊兩軍曾激戰</h3>
<p>泰縣通訊、靖江日軍四百餘名，附輕便機關槍四架重機關槍兩架、企圖分五路進犯泰興、於二十日晨八時、先犯蝦蟆圩、當經華方游擊隊出動迎擊、接觸至十二時許、日軍不支、仍向靖江退去、是役雙方傷亡、尚未查明、</p>
<p>揚州仙女廟日軍七八十名、二十日上午四時許向江家橋進犯、同時另一部份向張王溝進犯、在湯家莊與華軍遭遇、激戰甚烈、另有日軍三四十名、由孔家莊。大涵莊、企圖向磚橋華軍陣地進犯，嗣知華軍有備、未敢蠢動、當雙方在湯家莊激戰猛烈時、仙女廟日軍、開砲二三十發示威、同時揚州日軍、亦在東關外開砲饗應助戰、揚州並開來日軍五六十名、邵伯又開來日軍二三十名增援、雙方激戰至十時許始停、日軍向霍家橋而退、</p>

<p>滬戰發生以來、租界當局對於界內糧食問題、極爲關注疏通來源、調劑供求、並嚴格限制食米由滬轉口、江海關爲遵奉非常時期糧食調節辦法、拒絕大量轉口、故滬市食米、進多出少、據業中人調查、目下全滬存米、頗爲充足、各棧均已儲滿、米店存貨、亦堆積如山、總數的在七十萬包以上、且來貨仍源源不絕、滬市民食、可吿無虞、惟日商與華北商民合組公司、向產地直接採辦、殊爲積極、大都由常陰沙·白茆口·等處、裝輪運至楊樹浦、再裝日輪運至靑島、轉往華北或逕運日本、爲數的達百餘萬担、故食米私運出口、仍甚猖獗、</p>

<p>局方職員</p>
<p>無一人列席、故建議應邀請與商人代表相等人數之職員與會，出任委員之商人、與局方之惟一聯繫者、厥爲工部局銓叙委員會主席密區爾、兩年餘之前、曾將職員薪金大加减低之經濟委員會、密氏亦其中委員之一、工部局職員感覺至少應准許代表兩人列席、其一由職員聯合會推出、另一則由警務處</p>
<p>巡捕推出</p>
<p>蓋巡捕不准加入聯合會、而彼等之觀點、或爲局方或新委員會所不悉也、迄今爲止、該委員會甫進行調查、而西人史蒂華諸人所組織之工部局納稅人調查委員會、亦繼續進行、據史氏語一記者云、商界代表委員會、並不酬報、故</p>
<p>以理度之</p>

<p>似覺不能</p>

<h3>日方壓制烟台外人貿易　各國使狗館謀應付　一俟烟台情况明　卽將採取適當行動</h3>
<p>大陸報云、烟台日方當局頃宜佈、凡在一月十五日以前所定貨物、准許發給出口許可證、至月三十一日爲止、故日方之壓制烟台外商出口貿易、已展緩半月、但據昨（二十三日）晚所接烟台消息、對於日方暫行寬放之辦法、是吾外滙條例亦行寬放、則未說明、是項條例之實施、凡出售外匯、確實均由橫濱正金銀行所獨佔、苟日方</p>
<p>賡續厲行</p>
<p>其外滙之「正式滙率、則烟台必失其興盛之花邊與麻布貿易、而由汕頭起代之、昨自向來可靠方面探悉、駐北中美大使館對於烟台情况之報吿、仍加以研究、據稱、關於日方取締貿易之情報、旣不完全、抑且言之不淸、故有關各外國大使館一俟烟台情况明瞭、即將採取</p>
<p>適當行動</p>
<p>烟台消息並稱、日海軍當局在靑島所取壓制該地外商營業之方法、與目下在烟台所用辦法、兩者顯相雷同、按照烟台之貿易限制、日方所設統制出口之辦事處有拒不以出口許可證發給中外商人之權、是項新限制、乃緊隨刻已完全實行之</p>
<p>統制貨幣</p>
<p>新條例而施行、事實上烟台商人不能照市塲上之匯率購買滙兌、而被迫依照日方所定匯率購買之、致使彼等不能與他埠按照市塲匯率而購匯兌之商人相競爭、是項新條例、雖展緩實行、但昨據本埠商界稱、彼等以爲觀于日方頻加干涉、烟台之進出口商行將</p>
<p>發覺彼等</p>

<h3>一九三八年份　工部局工業報告　（續）</h3>
<p>（工業上之意外事件）經向工部局報吿之工業上及職業上之意外事件、全年共有一·五一三起、（一九三七年有一·九七六起一九三六年有二·二○○起）上年初、各工廠之工人數目、比往年爲少、此乃意外事件减少之一種原因、但下半年之工人旣多、意外事件當見增加、事實上所以相反者、或係報吿不翔實所致、故本年必須重新設法、以便搜集報吿、有醫院若干家、徇工業科之請、按期錄送報吿、另有若干家、報吿較少、就全年之紀錄計算、自醫院方面收得之報吿、僅佔百分之三十八、而一九三七年有百分之六十三、警務處救火會救護軍股、以及少數工廠廠主、亦有報吿、工業科欲使負責之工廠廠主、按時呈報意外事件、但事實上之成績、距此目標甚遠、上年份之工人死亡率、比前數年爲高、在工作時受傷之工人一·五一三名中、有八十八名身死、（一九三七年有五十八名一九三六年有九十五名）由此可知意外事件之百分之六·一、致工人死亡、前兩年之死亡率、則分別爲百分之三及百分之四·五、試將上年與一九三六年之數字相對照、上年經紀錄之意外事件較少、而死亡人數、竟與一九三六年相差無幾、建築業之工人、（包括建築房　及　路）死亡最多、共有二十一名、其中十一名因墮下而殞命、此外有運輸業工人十六各、機器五金業工人十三名、紡織業工人十一名、均重傷身死、與用機械力發動之機器有關之致命事件、共有十四起、因電氣而發生之致命事件、共有十二起、因工廠失火而喪生之工人共有十一名、因墮下而身死者有二十九名、爲墮下之物體擊傷致死者有八名、就上開之數字而觀、可見因墮下而肇禍之决數最多、死亡人數、竟比因機器而喪生者增多一倍有奇、受傷之工人、以屬於運輸業者爲最多、共計三二五名、內有二十一名身死、此種職業之工人中有七十六名、在上午九時與十二時之間慘遭意外、另有五十六名、在下午三時與六時之間受傷、可見各街道上在上開時刻以內之擁擠狀况、爲出事原因之一、</p>
<p>（受傷工人之年齡）年齡在十五歲與十九歲之間之工人、最易受傷、上年之百分率爲二一一、（一九三七年爲百分之二六·六·一九三六年爲百分之二六·八一九三五年爲百分之三三·三）比上開年齡冉高一級之工人、亦易遭意外、就情理而言、工人數目最多之一級中、受傷之工人數目亦必最多、故本埠工廠所用工人、可推定爲童工居多、此等童工、來自鄉村未久、手藝生疏、缺少經騐、以致常因意外事件而被犧牲、</p>
<p>漸見起色之各種工廠中、大都需要蒸汽、方能製造出品、因此新工廠內裝設之鍋爐及其他汽壓機器、爲數甚多、例如繅絲廠靛染廠紡紗廠及紙廠等、無不以汽壓機器爲主要工具、工部局所定之管理鍋爐規則、已施行二年餘、在施行期間、曾有鍋爐四五四具及其他汽壓機器四十五具、陳請登記、此等鍋爐中有裝於蘇州河以北各處之七十六具、未經使用、故已經登記而效力者、尚餘三七八具、</p>
<p>工部局工業科實行管理之目標、在使所有工廠中之鍋爐、無論何時、確備有效之證書、上年間受監督之鍋爐、共有一九三具、（內有裝於西區界外馬路上之工廠內者三三具）、其中一○七具、已備有效之證書、此外八十六具、尚未完全適台工程師所定條件、監督鍋爐之事務、雖未盡如願而償、然已有實在之進步、倘工部局未曾訂定監督規則、現在經工程師注意之大多數鍋爐、必無從檢騐、</p>
<p>工部局曾登記機械工程師、每家工廠必須聘用經核准之工程師一人、該工程師負責裝置機器、並使其能以滿意而安全之方法運用、因此機器之安全、將來能有保障、而意外事件、當可因防患於未然而减少、</p>
<p>（鍋爐管理員訓練班）工業科會於上年間開辦鍋爐管理員訓練班四次、最後一屆、至年底時尚未結束、受訓練之鍋爐管理員有四十五人、如連以前三屆之學員合計、共有一五三人、前年受過訓練者有二十一人、每人聽講十二决、每决二小時、課程之內容爲汽壓機之構造及其功用等、現有之一班中、除上開之管理員四十五人以外、尚有工頭及管理鍋爐之其他人員四十五人、經工業科准其隨班聽講、此種集團訓練方法、當能更見改良、而施於他種工人、將來不久即可着手試辦、（未完）</p>
<h3>開發西南西北富源　竭力完成鐵路綱　湘票款通車成渝完成在卽　川滇緬寶成積極進行</h3>
<p>我國政府鑒於欲開發西南西北富源、必先完成交通建設、允以鐵路爲最重要、因大量貨運、非鐵路不足以担負此重任、交通部决以全力完成鐵路建設、同時修築公路、以爲鐵路之輔助、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>西北西南　原有鐵路</p>
<p>中國之西部包含西北之陝西·甘肅·靑海·寗夏·新疆·等五省、西南之四川·西康·貴州·雲南·廣西·等五省、此十省之土地面積四百九十二萬方公里、人口總數的一萬萬人、在鐵路方面、現有三線、除滇越路成立較早外、其他二綫之完成、亦爲最近數年之事、隴海之潼關西安段·及西安寶鷄段·箇碧石鐵路、均完成於二十五年、三綫合計僅九百公里、此外尚有川北鐵路、其長度不過二十二公里、</p>
<p>成渝鐵路　完成通車</p>
<p>成渝鐵路本爲川漢鐵路之西段、自川漢鐵路失敗後、擱置達二十年之久、民國二十五年三月、鐵道部遵照五中全會之議案、首先籌建成渝路、分八隊測量、自成都至重慶全爲川省物產富饒之區、長凡五百二十三公里、需款五千萬元、除組川黔鐵路公司收足資本二千萬元外、並由法國銀團承借料款三千四百五十萬元、於前年二月開工、俟戰事發生後、奉令提前完工、今年春間、即可通軍、</p>
<p>籌建川滇　滇緬兩路</p>
<p>目前正在積極籌劃之新路、爲川滇·滇緬·兩大幹綫、前者自四川叙府至雲南昆明、後者自昆明至緬甸、爲長江與印度洋間之主要交通綫、兩路共長一千五百公里、統歸川滇鐵路公司承建、該公司資本二千萬元、沈昌任川滇鐵路工程局長、薩福鈞任滇緬鐵路工程局長、川滇路已開工、限二年半完成、滇緬路經費、在英貸華興建廣梅鐵路之信用借款中支付、</p>
<p>湘票路分　四段興建</p>
<p>湘桂鐵路自粵漢路衛陽站往桂林·柳州·邕寗·龍州·至桂越交界之鎭南關、與滇越鐵路支綫接軌、全路長九百五十公里、分四段興築、以衡陽桂林爲第一段、桂林柳州爲第二段、柳州邕寗爲第三段、邕寗鎭南關爲第四段、其衡陽桂林段長凡三百公里、需費三千六百萬元、經一年半之工作、已於去年十月一日通車、其餘三段路基已完成、預定今年冬全路通軍、</p>
<p>完成寶蘭　寶成兩綫</p>
<p>隴海鐵路通至寶鷄後、即有西上與南下二議、西上者以蘭州爲目標、南下者以成都爲終點、賣成線之經濟價值較大、且爲西南西北兩大鐵路系統之主要連絡綫、乃决定先行建築、該路長凡五百公里、需款五千萬元、並經向比國銀公司籌借、自二十五年秋間派隊實施勘測以來、行將開始動工興建、至於寶蘭綫、决俟寶成綫完成後、再行動工興建、</p>
<p>湘黔鐵路　株湘一段</p>
<p>自浙贛鐵路公司擬改中國鐵路公司後、欲將由長沙經貴陽至重慶之西南鐵路·槪歸該公司承辦、此議雖未實現、而湘黔鐵路工程局已於二十五年六月成立、决定先築株州至湘瑯一段、全路長約一千公里、需建築設備費一萬六千萬元、自經動工興築後、現在工程已進行至何種程度、尚無所聞、一說該路工程因戰事關係、業已暫行停頓、</p>
<p>計劃完成　西南鐵綱</p>
<p>以上七綫、共長的五千公里、需款至少五萬萬元、今交通部决以全力先完或竇成·成渝·川滇·滇緬·湘桂·五大幹綫、此五大幹綫長爲三千五百公里、完成之後、西北西南、可以連成一氣、且有國際通道三綫、（一）由昆明出仰光、（二）由昆明出海門、（三）由柳州出海防、此外並擬以貴陽爲中心、北築川黔在重慶與成渝相連、西修滇黔、在曲靖與川滇相連、東建湘黔、在株州與粵漢相連、南建桂黔、在柳州與湘桂相連、</p>
<p>然後再建　西北各路</p>
<p>再决則以蘭州爲中心、按次建築隴海路之實蘭段、在實鷄與實成相連、包蘭路自蘭州至寗夏再至包頭、與平綏路相連、甘新路自蘭州經哈密·迪化·至塔城與蘇聯鐵路相連、甘靑路自蘭州至西寗、川甘路自隴海路之天水至成都、與寶成·成渝·二路相連、更延長至康定、而完成西北鐵路系統、此上各項計劃、决按步逐漸實施、</p>

<p>搶刦未遂　一盜就擒</p>
<p>天潼路七百二十七弄一百十三號某姓住宅內、於昨日下午五時三十分許、突有匪徒六名、前往行刦、內中僅一匪挾有手槍、另一匪徒則持假手槍一柄、當將入屋之際、事被女主發覺、即登樓閉戶、在呼捉强盜、各匪見事敗露、立即退出、急向弄外奔逃、不謂該屋中人、亦追踪而出、奔吿崗捕、因此即在弄口將殿後之匪拘獲、並抄出假手槍一柄、乃一併帶入捕房暫押、一面根據錢索、四出搜捕餘黨、</p>

<h3>學徒自訴　經理舞弊</h3>
<p>僅憑空言並無實據　顯係誣吿拘獲訊辦</p>
<p>厦門路景豐紗號學徒、海寗人蔣樹康、近向第一特區法院以刑事自訴該號股東兼經理劉縈福、其起訴意旨略稱、在民國二十三年夏間起、本人與劉曾共同將購進之紗於售出時、在每一大包內、竊出一小部、另行出售、</p>
<p>如此舞弊</p>
<p>迄至二十四年底止，的得不法利益數千元、本的定共同分潤、乃今竟爲劉一人獨佔、是以提起控訴、乃當庭訊之時、蔣不能提出證據、證明其所起訴之事實、僅憑空言主張、故結果諭知不受理、而蔣心猶不甘、上訴於高二分院、經高分院審訊之下、除將蔣之</p>
<p>上訴駁回</p>

<p>將蔣收押</p>
<p>一面由徐院長於十一日備文連同卷宗發交老閘捕房偵查一，經華探長陳永貴。西探長司密司。詳細偵查、並向與景豐素有往來之盈昌鑫泰等紗號調查，均能證明蔣所控事</p>

<h3>我國會計學術與會計職業之回顧與前瞻　（續）</h3>
<p>— 潘序倫</p>
<p>以上所舉官廳簿記與銀行簿記二項，制度內容，均倣日本。鐵路會計統一委員會之工作，則由美國亞當士氏（H．C．Adams）主其事，故我國鐵路會計，可謂源出美國。以言各該改革於我國會計界影響之最大者，則莫如銀行會計。蓋政府機關與鐵路兩者，與工商界之關係均頗疏遠，銀行界與工商界之關係則極爲密切，銀行會計制度之爲工商界所倣用，自較易易。迄於今日，我人仍見許多工商機關，應用銀行習用之傳票及日記賬格式者，非無因也。</p>
<p>以言會計敎育，據我人所知，除前述北平簿記講習所外，南京民國法政大學於民國元年曾開設簿記學班，本人亦爲該班學生之一。民國三年北平有會計講習所之設，公私大學，設有商科者較少，開設簿記會計班决者更少所聞，而會計學譯著之出版，亦復寥若晨星。</p>
<p>自民國六七年至民國十六年問爲北，我國會計學術及會計職業漸趨發展。因當歐戰之際，列强無暇東顧，我國新式企業如紗廠，麵粉廠等創設頗多，銀行業務亦趨發達，束南繁盛之區，公私大學及專門學校因事實上之需要，多添設商科，如南京高等師範商科之設，（民國十年），武昌高等商業學校，及上海商科大學之設立，中國公學復旦大學商科之創辦，以及中等學校程度之上海商業專門學校等均是。簿記會計譯著，自民國九年起亦遂逐漸增多，其間不乏較佳著作，如楊端六氏之商業簿記與記賬單位論，吳應圖氏之會計學與審計學，謝霖氏之實用銀行簿記等均是。新式會計之應用範圍，亦逐漸自政府，銀行鐵路等擴大及於工商企業，民十年左右，商務印書館，南洋兄弟烟草公司卽已改用新式會計，其他企業，採用者亦夥，惜限於見聞，未能一一調查列出耳。</p>
<p>專門之會計師職業，亦於是漸萌其初芽。民國七年，前北政府農商部頒行會計師暫行章程，惟國人需求未亟，新制推行不廣。民國十年，滬上始有會計師事務所之設立，又三載，上海會計師公會發起，經營匝載，以十四年三月成立。至民十六年止，上海會計師公會會員凡五十七人，其中確實執行業務者，復不及三分之一。</p>
<p>綜觀自遜情末葉起至民十六年止，我國會計學術軍閥割據。大規模企業雖有設立，然歐戰後又現衰落，而經營方法，未臻健全，故新式會計之應用繼圍亦殊狹窄。直至國民政府統一全國，會計學術及職業方有蓬勃發展之現象焉。（未完）</p>

<h3>壯烈犧牲</h3>
<p>— 支錫百</p>
<p>—亡友陸君企賢週年紀念</p>
<p>成羣的飛機，徘徊在滬靑公路的上空，拍拍……一陣陣機關槍掃射聲，轟轟轟……一個個炸彈的爆裂聲，震動了趙巷的房屋，河流，樹木：玻璃窗格格地響了，水面上起了鄰鄰的波紋，枯葉在飄着。</p>
<p>河裏的船隻，連一接二地駛過，每個船上的舵工，都使用加倍的力量，臉上的表情、很是緊張，顯示着十分的慌亂。</p>
<p>「軍已到佘山了！」有人氣喘喘地跑進福興園，向大衆驚慌地報吿，滿園的茶客，都起了戰慄，臉色頓時都發了白</p>
<p>「走吧！不走聽死嗎？」滿園的人，一哄而散，霎時趙巷鎭上，起了一陣劇烈的騷亂，男的女的老的小的，都奔向家裏去。</p>
<p>「可是走到那裏去呢？生活不了啦。」每個人腦海裏同樣地湧現了一個嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>陸先生底家裏站滿了好些驚慌的人。</p>
<p>不錯，陸先生是趙巷的明燈，他能指點趙巷人應走的道路，不論在什麼時候。</p>
<p>「時間已到不能不走的當兒了。壯丁們把武器收拾起來，把老幼婦女裝上船，讓他們先走。我們年輕的在後面照顧，繞過靑浦，才有我們的生路。」陸先生向大衆嚴正地直捷地說，而且給他們解釋，爲什麼耍如此辦。</p>
<p>下午，一切都準備妥貼了，十幾條大船，滿裝着男女老幼，以及簡單的行裝，少許的糧食。中間的一條，安放着趙巷鎭所有的武器，用六個壯丁看守。每僩船上蓋着草棚，免得敵機轟炸。</p>
<p>開船了，十幾條船，連接成一條長蛇，陸先生的一家，排列在最後，這是陸先生預備有什麼事變時，他可以起來應付，而讓其餘的船毫無阻碍的過去。</p>
<p>船慢慢地向西逝去，趙巷的背影，逐漸在趙巷人限中消逝。</p>
<p>船到靑浦東門外，離松靑路只有二三里路了，驀然背後拍的一槍，接着「靠船聲音，猶如猛獸在吼。</p>
<p>陸先生揮着手，意思是呌前面的船，儘管向前開去，什麼事都由他抵擋，他更忘不了的是一船趙巷的武器。</p>
<p>「靠船！」又是一聲在吼，陸先生的船不得不停岸了。</p>
<p>「你是誰？」</p>
<p>「……」陸先生沒有回答，他沒有明白對方是甚麼東西。</p>
<p>「間你是誰？」</p>
<p>「我是中國人！」當陸先生看淸了問話的是一個中國人而鋼盔上嵌着圓形的紅徽時，他乾脆地說。他明瞭屈服是羞恥，偷生不如成仁，好在大衆已加速地前進，犧牲至多也只有自己一家。</p>
<p>「媽的，誰不知道你是中國人！你是誰？」</p>
<p>「我是陸企賢！」</p>
<p>「你做甚麼事的？」</p>
<p>「我是中國人，生於現代的中國，做中國需要做的工作。」</p>
<p>「抓他起來！」對方羞了，惱了。</p>
<p>「不用抓，我自已會起來！陸先生往岸上爬。</p>
<p>「……對方沒有話。</p>
<p>「你是誰，你不是中國人嗎？你幹的什麼工作？要是五萬萬中國人都爲自己國家打算，你們背後的異族人，怎會闖進這地方來？」陸先生像對羣衆演講似的，痛快地責問了一番。</p>
<p>一羣猛獸的異族人，睜圓了眼睛，急促地咕噥了一陣，把手一揚，意思是不耐等了，動」手吧！</p>
<p>問話的舉起了雪亮的槍刺，陸先生却坦然伸長了脖子，聽他們擺佈。</p>
<p>「說吧！前面有沒有兵隊　「有！多得很，他們等你多時了。他們要用機關槍和手溜彈歡迎你們！」</p>
<p>「你不實說？」</p>
<p>一實說！你以爲我和你同樣的嗎？你眞侮辱我了。」</p>
<p>嘹！雪亮的刺刀在陸先生面上削過，接着陸先生的眼鏡，從鼻樑上溜到地上，鮮紅的熱血，從陸先生左頰上淌下。</p>
<p>嚓！刺刀又一閃，陸先生右頰也流血了。</p>
<p>「認得這傢伙嗎？」</p>
<p>「認得！不久以後，這傢伙將溜到我軍的手中，變爲找民族復興的動力！」說着，陸先生揚了揚眉，他覺得兩頰有些發燒。</p>
<p>「砰！」陸先生應聲而倒，兩隻脚不住地伸屈着，却睜圓了眼睛，在呼着「中華民國萬歲！打倒××帝國生義！殺盡漢奸！……」</p>
<p>「砰！」又是一聲，陸先生沒有聲音了。</p>
<p>三柳的水汨汨地在淌着淚；九學俯下了頭表示傷悲。在地上，破碎的眼鏡片，却在閃閃地發出光亮，在象徵着最後的光榮。</p>
<h3>捷訊隨年至　軍連似歳新</h3>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<h3>「靈感」</h3>
<p>— 求眞</p>
<p>蘇聯作家M左勤克，在他的「我怎樣寫作」中說：</p>
<p>「…我有兩種工作方法。一種方法是：什麼時候有了靈感，什麼時候我便以創作的衝動去寫。這時候工作進行得很輕快，又沒有缺點。全部的圖面，全部的事物的結構，都在自然而然中組成了。</p>
<p>「第二種方法是當沒有靈感的時候。遇到這樣的塲合，我便以技術的訓練去寫。在這種工作方法上，我像通常由潛意識所做的那樣去做：自己建起主題的計劃，自己適當地處置母一段和每個字，由字，演成故事。……」</p>
<p>不過，他到後又更進一步說，「它（靈感）對於作家，對於作家的全部工作是一種唯一的要素。技術固能帮助靈感，能補充靈感的不足；也能代替靈感，—有了技術，也能終於不致低墜了自己的質量；然而若永遠沒有仟何樣的靈感，那個作家一定無法去得到深遠的進境。」</p>
<p>「靈感」之所以爲文藝寫作時不可缺少的要素，不但爲了便於寫作—以一般經騐而論，有了靈感的衝動而寫作，的確要寫得輕快而且圓滿；並且更是爲了文藝這東西，在形象的表現之中，必得蘊藏着動人的情緒。它是借了形象，通過了感性，而後轉入到認識中去的。作家的認識陪伴着情感　迸寫出的創作，才能予讀者以「共鳴」，發生文藝的效用。如果沒有眞實情感的話，那末無論作家的世界觀怎樣地正確，技術怎樣地熟練，他所寫出的，至多是原則的說明，形象的摹寫，它總是死的，沒有感染性的東西。所謂「公式主義」，所謂「八股」，除掉由於技巧的毛病外，作者的沒有靈感，也是一大原因。</p>
<p>然則什麼呌做「靈感」呢？左勤克認爲「靈感是肉體健康，心力，神經活潑和堅定自信的一種幸福的結合，這種結合將自己的全部能力投送到一處地方—在一個塲合—在文學中。」</p>
<p>這個解釋不大明瞭。我認爲，所謂「靈感」，是認識和情感的結合，也就是意識的衝動。它决不是像一般人所誤認爲天上掉下來的虛無飄渺的聖靈，而是在生活實踐中與事物有所交涉而生產的精神狀態。所以靈感也是現實的產物，離開了現實，那它便是本洞的，虛偽的。</p>
<p>這樣看來，作家們就不用因爲沒有靈感而發愁。只要你去接觸現實，去體騐生活，深入到你所要描寫的社會中去實踐，去領會，那末，跟着你的正確的世界觀或認識而來的，一定會有許多不同景况的正義感發生。要這樣地去追求和把握着靈感而寫作，才能寫得眞實，有感染性，而全讀者共鳴。</p>
<p>光有認識和題材，而生呑活剝地寫出來，終究耍使人讀來覺得牽强的；因爲這雖然不一定就是文字的游戲，也到底不曾做到文藝的眞實。作家們應當把認識還原到現象中去，把題材還原到現實中去，—就是，要去實踐生活，以使認識和題材經過自已所由勃生的情緒的鍛鍊而融化，體現成爲眞　的靈感而後寫將出來，這才好。</p>
<p>當然，倘若已經具有這樣靈感的人，寫作起來就更容易成功了。我希望他們能够大胆地多多寫作。</p>
<h3>江陰義民別傳</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>關於這本「江陰議民別傳」（胡山源作，共十六個短篇，世界書局版，四角）的思想，楊非在「紅茶」第八期上已經介紹過，現在我想試一試探究這本書的技巧或藝術。</p>
<p>作者所根據的材料，都收在附錄，可以讓我們對照着看，明白作者所曾經下過的苦功。比較簡單的似乎是用明祝純嘏的「江陰後錄」和淸計六奇的「黃毓祺起兵竹塘」來寫「黃毓祺」，用「天香閣隨筆」來寫胡志學」「徐五」和「李介立」，用「虞初新志」來寫戚三朗」。較費工夫的就從淸韓菼的「江陰城守紀」，淸許重熙的「江陰城守後紀」以及淸沈濤的江上遺聞」等篇來寫「許用」「季氏兄弟」「程璧」「王華」「湯三老兒」「陳憲欽一「徐玉揚」等篇，大的側重點如下：六月初一二日（許用及季氏兄弟），十五日（程璧），七月十二及二十九日（湯三老兒），二十至二十七日（徐玉揚），八月初二日（王華），初八日（陳憲欽）。不過「湯三老兒」和「湯姓童子」不一定就是父子，扭台在一起，更爲有趣，這是作者大胆而且聰明的地方，因爲小說究竟不是信史，是不必斤斤較量的。「許用」篇中所加的五更調，勸降歌以及答歌雖是作者代擬，却比一語帶過有趣得多。</p>
<p>最複雜的大的是「黃明江」「何氏兄弟」以及「陳二郞」這三篇。黃明江這名字是得自傳說的，所以言人人殊，「江陰城守紀」和「江上遺聞」寫作黃明江，「後紀」和「鹿樵紀聞」則作黃雲江，「天香閣隨筆」又作王雲岡，三個字完全不同。作者斟酌其間，把這五種文字穿織在一起，並且很有趣的作唱句式的對白，是煞費了一番苦心的。何氏兄弟即何常何泰，作老把「明季南略」裏的「兄弟二人」就拉來裝在何氏弟兄頭上了，這也是頗爲巧妙的。「陳二郞」雖　「明淸兩代軼聞大觀」，却把城破以後的許多軼事巧妙地祖織在一起。開端引用了一難民口述」中的佛殿藏人一節，中段又借陳二郞的遊玩，揷進兩件悲慘的事實，（女屍影和裸婦叢箭，均見天香閣隨筆）就算是陳二郎眼裏看出來的，也頗費匠心。</p>
<p>依我個人的私見，認爲下列叫篇，當爲全書壓卷，就是：「湯三老兒」「陳憲欽」「何氏兄弟」以及「陳二郞」，一方面固然是故事本身刺激性最大，一方面也出於作者的技巧純熟。「湯三老兒」寫得如火如荼，像讀水滸三國一樣的有趣。「陳意欽」一結，故弄狡獪，雖未明言水底刺客是誰，但讀者已經無有不知此即陳憲欽的了。並且，按照野史，這刺客不一定就陳憲欵，作者這樣隱約的寫，倒恰好與野史不悖了。「何氏兄弟」幾乎全篇以錢莊衛語比擬對淸兵作戰，語妙絕倫，確是一篇難得的好文章。九歲的「陳二郞」父寫得極可愛，宛如小孩動作和口吻，阿里達不知人與人之間的樂趣，也刻畫入微。</p>
<p>所引爲遺憾的，就是「閻典史」，這江陰城守的支持者倒不曾有一篇小說，雖然他楚典史，究竟也是江陰『義民」，不能因爲做了官，就把做百姓的資格取消；况且，他本已歸隱，做典史不過爲民衆所推戴罷了。還有，沒有女性的抗戰者；比方說，黃毓祺的妻子屢决自殺就是很好的材料。但這未免是求全責備了。</p>
<p>（按）屢决自殺的是黃毓祺之媳。她的自殺，似乎爲了殉夫，不是爲了抗滿，作者不寫她，或即因此。</p>

<h3>母親的歡心</h3>
<p>— 摺痕</p>
<p>——呈遠在沙塲的哥哥</p>
<p>當你在月白風消荒凉遍野的沙塲上，懷念起母親而作還鄉之念時，請你牢記着這句話：「沒有民族的自由，是沒有母親的。」</p>
<p>母親的淚珠，是愛你憐你懷繫着你的表現，但是你不要因此而起傷感，因爲母親的淚珠，是幸福的南針，假若我們被壓制在敵人的鐵蹄下時，將有欲哭無淚的日子。</p>
<p>母親險上的皺痕，一天天的在加深了，母親的身軀，像蘆葦般的瘦弱了，母親的變頰，日漸乾枯下去，……倘若你憶起這些時，那麼你就奮發起精神，拿起槍桿，上好了刺刀，去殺盡敵人的頭　，帶一點血回來去給母親痛飲，養胖了蘆葦般的母親。</p>
<p>現在天寒了，母親總喜歡沐浴在白日的陽光之流裹，得來一點溫暖，假若一天天陰了，那你應該舉起你底變拳揭開烏烟般的雲幕，讓靑的天，白的日，照紅了大地。</p>
<p>你的靑春，你的快樂，你的幸福，你的智慧，你的前程，你的光明，你的壯志……以及你的一切呵！不要在母親的淚珠裏面喪失了。</p>
<p>母親在閑暇時，常談起岳飛的故事，她是怎樣地欽佩岳武穆的忠勇呵！你如果要博得母親的歡心的話，那你就整好旗鼓，在自由的火花下，登上露天的舞臺，去份演岳飛的故事吧！</p>
<p>在全國民衆慶祝全面抗戰勝利的一天，你　着自由的榮耀的軍冠回來，常你走到站在碼頭上遙望着愛兒凱旋歸來的母親的慈懷之前時，你應該微笑着說：「母親！你的愛兒帶着自由回來了。」</p>
<h3>最好你不要想</h3>
<p>— 路弓</p>
<p>最好你不要想，</p>
<p>那美麗的家鄉，</p>
<p>它現在已經燬滅，</p>
<p>並且變了墳塲。</p>
<p>田園早就沒人耕種，</p>
<p>瓦　裏的鐮刀開滿黃花，</p>
<p>那十多年的老屋，</p>
<p>祇剩幾根支柱東傾西斜。</p>
<p>到今天已經流亡幾千里，</p>
<p>區區家鄉儘可忘記，</p>
<p>向前走吧，我勸你，</p>
<p>前面另有新天地。</p>

<p>晨　初以倫敦大條近平遠縮、紐約銀價勿動、倫敦生金亦無變更、滙兌英對美大三厘七、對法長十丸生丁、對滬升一二五、美對英漲二五、對法降一二五，對滬大一角、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行早開現貨賣價英滙八辨士四二一八七五、美滙十六元四〇六二五、較之前收、英平美長〇三一二五、開後英美烟公司結進華比花旗現貨美匯初十六元四三七五、繼僅三七五、兼之洋行亦吸收大英有利現貨英金八辨士四二一八七五、旋步軟至八辨士四〇六八二五、滙豐掛牌及白銀平衡稅揭曉均未更動、此後外電香港與西商沙遜相繼賣予美行華比有利英金八辨士四三七五、及美金十六元四三七五、加之錢兌業亦售於荷蘭安達華義現貨港滙五十七元、與五十六元八七五、是以狀况轉硬、午收英金八辨士四二一八七五、美金十六元四〇六二五、</p>
<p>後市初因港電沙遜等賣意不淡、又來售予滙豐現貨英金八辦士四三七五、及售予荷蘭麥加利美金十六元四三七五、故狀態仍鬆、入後某行突來吃進華行美滙僅十六元三七五、加之日行亦起扒結華比十六元三七五、並又購進華義有利英金祇八辨士三九〇六二五、更以華義荷蘭吸收錢兌業港滙元十六元八七五、故潛勢趨緊、晚收銀行賣價英匯八辨士四〇六二五、美滙十六元三七五、結果較之前收英軟〇一五六二五、美無榮辱、港滙略鬆一二五、</p>
<h3>貼現率已定</h3>

<p>二十三日倫敦電、投機家少數賣出、市面平定、收盤後市面繼續平靜、大條銀近期未更、遠期回縮〇六二五、紐的銀電、美銀價依舊有行無市、又孟買銀電、印銀市况平靜、現貨與近遠期均無變動、</p>
<h3>外幣大都升</h3>
<p>昨日英純金未動、英美滙兌升二五、外匯結款甚旺、外電供給殷切、供求尚平、市價盤旋帶軟、烚赤浮多仍多塞出、惟港帮吸牧米懈、市價變動甚狹、趨勢微軟、外幣因外匯趨軟、市價多趨上升、公會交易稀少、振茂出永泰進英金鎊五十個、惠通出永泰進英金鎊五十個、勤泰出同豐進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金鎊升一角、英金票升二分、美金鎊升一角、美金票升一分半、法郞票升一厘、新加坡票升一分、坎拿大票升四分、斐律濱票升一分、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>大戶觀望　金市沉寂</h3>
<p>呆定於二零九元</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、突轉呆悶局勢、毫無精彩、終日逗留於二千〇〇九元行市之中、蓋一般大戶多呈旁觀、以視歐洲局勢之變化爲目標、中途雖港帮暗中繼續搜羅、但爲數有限、僅百兩左右、且本市銀樓帮暨錢兌業等相繼拋塞頗湧、致市價終則軋跌三元、各方人心平定、交易寥落無幾、銀樓首金未見更動、海關金曁中英純金等亦一致未更、</p>

<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、因烚赤呆定、致未更動、大同行老慶雲等仍懸原價二百〇四元、新同行懸二百〇二元、收進一百九十六元、</p>
<p>純金已止漲趨平</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况由疲軟而漸漸引起跌風、前之劇跌，未能因辦法宣佈後、而遽見回漲、已足覘人心之不振、數度盤旋、漸漸萎靡、在逼近發息期、不應有此現象、祇以一般人認此種新辦法、未免不滿、商人惟利是圖、羣起拋售、但此終爲一時的現象、整個公債前途依然樂觀也、昨日經過、初開時、市價堅穩、旋因散戶多頭及協大號先後出籠或求售、使市價站立不定、重復下降、午後交易已淸淡、十號賣出甲種、乙丙兩種、爲十一號賣小、全日趨勢、交易雖不甚旺、趨勢則完全在賣氣籠罩中、高壓重重、一時尚不易振作也、市價結果、一致趨跌、計小一角半至八角半不等、成交總數約計四十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後</p>
<p>股票交易仍不踴躍、各種價目似已漸漸趨堅、昨成交華成烟草公司股數十股、價爲二十二元、又比前稍形堅硬云、</p>

<h3>紗花　現紗市場投機居多　雙馬紗竟作標準看　全市成交同行占十之七五　日紗祗皮球交易尚稱熱鬧</h3>
<p>紗市平穩如常，客銷華南滇帮對於粗細紗納胃尚稱不惡、香港帮亦來採辦、致人心愈堅、但其他帮口仍呆滯無勁、浙東方面亦無動辦消息、因此現紗賣價、未能十分趨升、漲勢益覺和平、尚有一部份紗價因銷路不暢、反見疲落、惟申新九廠出品之二十支雙馬紗熱俏異常、且一般業外者及金融界囤藏極其熱烈、一般尚有加價收買者、足見其興趣之濃厚、查囤戶何以獨收雙馬紗一牌、因其市上熱銷，而每日有行市做開、兼之廠方出貨旣多、而客帮銷路父闊、一旦變遷、容易進出、不受阻碍、所以做心思者、將其作爲標準看待也、</p>
<p>查現紗市塲情形、晨初開盤氣勢平平、惟雙馬棧單貨銀行界有委託巨量收進、但開價與上日無甚軒輊、客銷亦不旺盛、現貨價反見開低一元半、少頃同業搜羅愈殷、香港帮雙馬現貨亦有胃扣、轉趨上升、此後中途高低不一、上下一二元之間、迨至收盤、雙馬紗又復回昂、在四百〇四元收市、查雙馬棧單貨非常俏利、成交計五百五十包、其餘犬女及雙馬現貨棧單兩項亦成交七百包、可見市塲上投機交易歿爲活動也、上午成交二千二百三十五包、同行成交占四分之三、客方成交五百丸十五包、行情二十支雙馬紗比上日漲二元、天女平、雙地球漲三元、特金城平、十支粗紗漲一二元、惟十支雙地球獨漲四元、聞崇信廠開出二十支大發三千包　價爲三百九十元至丸十五元、現鈔價、二三月期出淸、茲將各帮口買去之額列左、</p>
<p>日紗市塲情形、依然遲鈍如故、實需甚滯、各路皆無生意、因此市價暗澹無勁、惟本月份皮球交易尚稱熱鬧也、二十支水月現紗價爲三百十七元至六元、本月份價爲三百十六元至十五元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百十三元至十二元、本月份價爲三百〇一元半至〇七元云、</p>

<p>本市外棉外交易、因本棉存底甚薄、來貨日見稀少、價格因之日見高漲、而外棉價格反日見低廉、故近日交易殊甚熱鬧、即花號亦有大枇購進、昨日華廠方面、申新又進印棉二千包，巴西棉一千包、安進美種辛特二千包、送廠價爲七十一元、崇信亦進美種辛特二千包、通成公司進白洛區及奧默拉共二千包、碼頭交貨價爲七十一元及六十五元、尚有其他花號共進印棉二千餘包、茲將成交件及價格列後、</p>

<p>本埠洋行白廠絲交易、依然淸堅、用戶及囤戶購胃亦似滿足、蓋絲價騰漲過速、與海外市價距離過遠、亦使人不敢十分樂觀也、乾繭價昨售開三三〇元繭商討價已漲至三五〇元以上、折算絲本已近一四〇〇元餘、最近預測絲市、暫尚無法打開僵局、昨洋行僅有印度絲交易、用戶初吸購好牌子之廠絲、後則要求較低、全日成交的計三〇担、昨有湖絲一百九十三件運歐洲、</p>
<h3>大宗茶葉運歐洲</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、永興怡和協和等行、共成交珍眉三百四十餘箱、俱屬高中莊貨、售盤最高爲一四五至一七三元、最低爲八〇二至八〇五元、佈出之樣、雖尚有四千六百餘件、高中莊珍眉珠茶等暢銷之貨、爲數較稀、低次貨之針眉秀眉等、存底較豐、顧各洋行仍存抑價之意、昨日有茶葉二百十二噸、運往歐洲、而出香港運來茶磚一百件、</p>
<p>外棉市價、因歐洲政局行勢趨向不定、引起證劵暴跌、棉市受此打擊、亦趨下沉關於政府貸欵棉事、農部又有建議提呈政府、規定辦法係獎勵凡願將棉田荒廢不種者、其應獲之棉量、得由政府將貸款棉之一部份派給之、此法旣能减低新棉之產量，又能使政府之存棉减少、政府或有實行之希望、咋日紐的跌十磅昔、印度連同預測跌二羅比、埃及珞潑二三磅音、昨日匯兌略長、折合法幣棉價俱跌、美棉及巴西棉每旦跌一元二角餘、印棉及坎卽棉跌一元餘</p>

<h3>到貨凋零　本棉成交稅減　花號改業外棉</h3>
<p>本棉生意仍　寥若晨星、但售價堅挺如恒、蓋花號對於白包花進出尚不斷絕、獨廠家始終未曾採辦、日廠絕無舉動做開、全係同業成交、額量旣絀、擔脚更少、實則各方到貨凋零、市上存貨稀薄之故也、中外各廠處此環境之下、非採辦外棉个克補救也、因此邇來購訂印棉與日俱進、花號商鑒於內地情形紊亂、棉區存貨漸罄有一部份業已改變宗旨、販運美印棉交易、蘇北一帶來源尚稱不薄、碼頭上到通州花三千七百七十七包、出口棉有五十件運汕頭、五百二十件運香港、八十件運北海、又海門來花一千二百件、白茆來花三百十件、茲將現棉成交之額量並市盤列左、</p>
<h3>疋頭　改牌日貨有混充國布運港</h3>
<p>被強佔之蘇綸廠　出貨已來滬銷售</p>
<p>國布　紗價步昂、國布囤戶擇廉囤藏、金融界亦頗有問津之意、惟現銷除川滇帮外、均趨淡薄、色布花色貨價殊堅昂、白貨市價呈混亂狀態、散額均較躉批爲廉、汕頭帮來電以當地謠言甚熾、各貨緩辦、惟急待應銷之貨、仍有裝去、怡和粗布加價後、市上小額手貨照市廉一二角、由本街及甬帮搜購近百件、香港帮國貨細斜續有購辦、昨成交三四十件、而改牌日貨細布斜紋、亦有混充國貨裝往、川滇帮進胃特健、成交花紫府綢花布色丁洋紗條漂布上林布漂白斜紋等貨三百餘件、二月份期貨滇帮亦已購進三百件之譜、</p>
<p>東布　晨市白貨售盤、因市塲賣風濃厚、本街進胃呆滯、細布細斜續趨鬆軟、龍頭細布曾喊盤十一元二角半、後市聞烟台靑島帮動辦、進細布細斜三四百件、本街亦有少數成交、形勢轉堅、惟較前日行市猶挫落每疋二分半左右、淪陷區廠之被日方强佔統制出貨者、昨市上已有蘇州蘇綸廠之神鷹粗布及細布出內外綿接辦發售、十六磅藍神鷹粗布開價每疋十三元二角、又十二磅神應細布十元〇九角、本街各批發莊進的五十包、開封帮辦去內外美華廣泰等廠出品之新花嗶嘰貢呢色丁的四十餘箱、俱係郵包裝運、花嗶嘰每碼四角一分半、花貢呢四角二分半、各檔色丁每疋在十元〇三四角之間、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉產不足</h3>
<p>尚難儘量供給需要　今日出口二萬餘包</p>
<p>昨現粉客銷、續見活潑、惟成交難以冉旺、因各廠目下生產未足、對於大帮去化、尚難儘量供給、而客銷數量、亦　零多　少、昨市天津方面、砲軍兵船等粉需要漸佳、南洋帮汕間等處、亦陸續需辦年貨、統市成交續有六萬包以上、連本街零批一併在內、二號粉各牌悉照四元八角原盤紅財神紅　花等粉、擯住未有成交、</p>
<p>今日麺粉出口、計有一萬包運天津、二千包運厦門、九干五百包運汕頭、</p>
<h3>麥不願廉售　大宗雜糧運南方</h3>
<p>昨小麥去路、廠需銳减、產價不鬆、到貨漸少、且二批阜豐定麥尚須本月杪抵滬、故市上存麥、大都不願再事貶脫、廠方亦難壓抑、故市面跌風漸息、高檔貨一律定立、中决貨與潮麥、依然鬆疲不一、全市成交以蕪湖麥爲大宗、江北南京麥决之、共開五千餘包、計由福新廠辦去三千包、阜豐廠辦去二千包、最高價仍爲六元五角云、</p>
<p>雜進口者昨有黃豆二百包自海門運來、又出口方面昨有豆子五百二十五噸運孟買、二百四十八噸運哥倫布，今日又有麩皮一千包運汕頭、豆子五百五十包運厦門、二千二百包運汕頭、一千七百六十包運汕頭、豆餅六百九十片運汕頭、生仁四百包蓬汕頭、叉四千七百七十包運香港、</p>
<h3>糯米獨俏　粳米萎靡　逃不出供求律</h3>
<p>昨日粳米各貨、均見小勢、獨變元又俏、因全市祗　三百包、而茶食店及酒釀作坊銷路頗好、賣方卽奇貨可居、抬價至十五元、後經再三講價、結果成交特貨開出十四元八、市面已較升二角、誠　意所難料、至於厚薄粳等各貨、其來源雖河下祇到五艘、但輪船來奢竟達一萬包出零、而火車抵埠者亦有五千包左右聞因近臘銀根關係所致、人心因之更虛、作客大都觀望、上半市竟形成不聞不問、半粒無交之勢、及後經售方轉舵甩價、但終難邀彼納意、是故結果、本街及囤戶所進多不過在四千包左右、此種淸寂景象、實近月來所未見、而若厚薄粳行情悉再降落一角有奇、杜洋尖埠尖、際此亦難立足、同疲角許</p>
<h3>蕪秈產價報漲</h3>
<p>客戶競辦直接轉口　洋米售價亦見提高</p>
<p>客秈晨市續見疲軟、京蕪各秈一度續小四五分、旋得蕪湖消息、該地被販戶直接轉口者之競辦、行情抬起三四角、貨主乃即擯守不肯續出、市亦逐步回振、特高貨又喊到十一元、而大市蕪湖秈亦已跨出十元、惟目下滬存充實、車輪來源絡繹不絕、後市如何、尚難預測、昨本街各戶進胃較活、全日成交有二千餘包云、</p>
<p>洋米邇日零星去化漸活、而市上存稀到乏、囤戶堅持、浮貨售罄、故行販配店行情、趁機提高、一號西貢連車費已喊至十四元五六角、無費凈盤亦討十四元三四角、比月初售價已提二三角、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮糖成倒懸狀</h3>
<p>昨糖市仍見穩秀，二四粗砂白轉口貨成交二百餘包、價十六元八角、現貨呌二十五元一角、未成交、太古糖無甚上落、國產糖潮帮開出奇白數十包、價十九元五角、赤砂百餘包、十五元四角半、據訊潮糖新提莊靑劃申須十五元、而此間對斯價暫難接近、形成倒懸之象、昨有糖二百三十包自泉州來、又九十包自典化來、</p>
<h3>南北貨　興泉圓棗到滬</h3>
<p>昨日自泉州運來　圓二百三十箱、興化來四百八十箱、秀　來三百九十箱、父泉州來桂圓肉十箱，興化來蜜棗駛箱子、</p>
<h3>煤炭　高次烟媒　混合推銷</h3>
<p>烟煤各貨，近雖各方　要激增、但高等貨每嫌價昂、售價不易喊高、推鉗爲難、而純用次貨、火燄旣低、且易凝結爐中、故又非顧客所歡迎、因此不得不將高次貨混合、以輕成本、昨某號開出克拉子煤二百餘噸、大都係是項貨品、計開節塊三四元五角統煤三十三元、頗形旺盛、</p>
<h3>來函　徵詢小型磨粉機</h3>
<p>頃接黃橋加力宋君函絕、鑒大半仍取給於獸力磨坊、粉質欠佳、成本又不過廉、久擬設小型麵廠、以增生產、曾投函上海數洋行詢問小型磨麵機、未得要領、現思先生對於上海市塲旣稔、諒於此種情形、亦必知悉、用特冒昧投函臺端、敬請示知滬上何廠或洋行有用三至十餘馬力之小型磨麵鋼磨鋼篩等機器出售、每小時出麵若干、售價若干、國產與歐美產優劣比較等情、如能代索圖樣說明尤佳、</p>
<p>編者、按徵詢事原不涉編輯事、宋君之原函甚長、用意良深、在抗戰時期、祗有各盡各大以求成效、故爲之發表，如各工廠各洋行以及一般讀者能知有此種機器者乞　見示、以便轉知、</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>親善</h3>
<p>— 彥公</p>
<p>「親善」是外交家常用的術語，正常的運用，便有」睦鄰」」善鄰」中張以爲一國外交政策的圭臬；其目的，就在造成國際間的和平相處，共存共榮；其條件，是必須建築在「正義」「和平」「誠信」的基礎上。然而目前一般野心家却正充份利用着「親善」作爲「勾結」「欺騙」「誘惑」的工具，口頭上儘管說得天花亂墜，究其實，只是一種「烟幕」「糖衣包」而已。</p>
<p>「親善」的反面，便是「仇恨」，侵略者標榜着的親善，因其本質上是背情悖理，形式上是笑裹藏刀，作用上是愚弄人算計人，所以結果是不斷地造成了天地間種種不可磨滅的「仇恨」。這種陰謀狡計，縱然一時僥倖成就，也祇是爲將來播種若干鬥爭殺戮的根苗，仍然不能獲得根本的解决。</p>
<p>國際間的親善運用，正到了登峯造極的化境。東西侵略者爲耍互相呼應，串同實施「敲」「嚇」「詐」，便以親善爲名，打伙結伴，締結侵略集團，美其名曰一反共同盟一，實則不耍說是不想反共，不敢反共，也無力反共，其唯一的企圖，祗在覬覦弱小。</p>
<p>德義利用這個動人的名詞，會誘惑了英法，在慕尼黑會議中獲得極大的成功，結果是犧牲了捷克，把捷克一割再割。希特勒勝利了，墨索里尼便接着要索法國的領土，以達成輪流敲詐的連臺好戲。</p>
<p>我們的東鄰「友邦，久已利用了這個名詞，夢想由「親善」而「提携」，而「獨佔中國」「呑滅中國」，進而雄覇世界」。只可憐中國早已洞燭其奸，一任他目言自語，却把鐵血粉碎了他的陰謀詭計。爲了計不得售於中國，便掉轉槍頭，效學德義，大言不慚，自詡爲和平砥柱，大唱其單想思的情調，想重建英日的親善關係，拉攏英國以便利他呑滅中國的企圖。可是英國已痛定思痛，不會直上日本的當，而主要的則是中國並非捷克，重光葵的演說，只覺搖尾乞憐已矣。</p>
<h3>車廂中的「王道」宣傳</h3>
<p>— 大康</p>
<p>五路公共汽車從北河南路底，帶着燬於砲火的實山路的殘餘的火燒焦臭氣息，直向三茅閣橘駛去。車廂中的乘客並不擁擠，不知道是不是因爲對於像墓塚一樣荒凉的寶山路，發生了一點悲憤的威喟，所以乘客們臉上的神情，都顯示出一種回思的沉默，大家都很呆然。</p>
<p>當車子停在天后宮橋的站頭上的時候，就湧上很多的乘客來，車廂中的空氣頓時騷擾了起來。車子一開，奇怪的，乘客們却個個都變得活潑起來了，眼光互相交射着。在賣票員的喊嚷中，乘客們有的在摸銅板；有的點燃了烟捲兒，抽起烟來了；有的似乎要跟人談起話來的樣子。</p>
<p>這時候，有一個身材魁梧，穿着一件黑色的馬庫呢大衣，戴着一頂咖啡色銅盆帽的傢伙，正跟他旁邊的一個矮個子搶着買票：「我來　我來！」「啊！我來！我來！」客氣得非常熟鬧，引起車廂中乘客們的特別注目。大家這樣熟烈的客氣過後，就各自坐下座位來。於是身材魁梧的傢伙開始用着響亮的聲調說起話來了：</p>
<p>「喂喂！你曉得麼，最近虹口貼出一張佈吿來，說是蔣委員長已接受汪精衛的議和條件，準備和日本講和了！」</p>
<p>「眞的麼？」矮個子有點驚奇，可是立刻神情鬆弛了下來，先歎了一口氣，然後緩慢地說道：「中國再跟日本這樣硬拼下來，也實在不是道理呀！唉！還是跟日本講了和，大家和和氣氣做生意，不是很好麼？」</p>
<p>身材魁梧的傢伙，早已點燃起烟捲了，一口濃烟噴出來，跟着就是一聲：「可不是麼？」於是聲音提高了一點，說：「照這樣打下去，就是苦了我們老百姓呀！你看，內地老百姓，受游擊隊的苦眞是一言難盡呀！」</p>
<p>一百矮個子眉頭一皺，右手向自己的大腿部狠命地拍了一記，似乎有一點憤憤然，聲音是也提得很高她說：「說起遊擊隊，他媽媽的，眞是可惡極是！……」</p>
<p>於是矮個子開始講游擊隊的「可惡一來了。</p>
<p>這時，車廂中的乘客們，對那兩位縱論「國家大事」的傢伙們，都用着憤恨的眼光瞧着。可是那個身材魁梧的傢伙却又說了起來：「抗戰，抗戰，只抗得一片焦士！一</p>
<p>說着，那兩個傢伙都深長地歎着氣，可是乘客們中間，有的却憤恨地罵了出來。。「漢奸！漢奸！」</p>
<p>一放屁！」同時車廂中孔出了罵聲。</p>
<p>可是四馬路到了。身材魁梧的，矮個子的，他們一齊站起身來，下車去了。當車又駛動的時候，噴恨的罵聲充滿了一車廂：不要臉的畜生！」「下决再遇到這種人，一定要打死他們！」…</p>
<p>一直到三茅閣橋，乘客們雖然下車了，可是大家的面孔上，還是被一種極度的噴恨的紅色充塞着</p>
<h3>談談僞「印花稅」</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>購買印花稅時請詳細辨別以免魚目混珠</p>
<p>自從大上海淪陷以後，印花稅就遭到空前的厄運，郵局被迫而停售了，愛國商人只能在「郵局停售，無從購貼」的條件下苦悶着！但是不久，國民政府的印花稅，由香港運滬，委托市商會分派各同業公會代售。而同時僞「統稅局」也發行了偽「印花稅」，但正式商人大都不去購買，因此便陷於停止狀態中。現在就來談談這種僞一印花稅」，因爲它的式樣和眞的差不多，恐它魚目混珠，欺騙一般識字不多的商人：同時也可以使大家得以明白的認識！</p>
<p>這種偽「印花稅」共分成八種：計六種小號，二種大號。居然也有一分二分和黃藍各種的區別，若是把它分成價值和顏色計有下列：</p>
<p>一分（黃色）二分（藍色）一角（　色）二角（淡藍色）五角（紫色）一元（紅色）以上小號共計六種</p>
<p>一角（玫瑰）一元（深黃）以上大號，共計二種</p>
<p>價值顏色大槪如上述，至於表面，四週也和眞印花一般環繞以花紋，常中却和眞的不同了，印的是一幢塔，塔畔有一似杭州西子湖裏的三潭印月之一，背後抱之以森林，林後有山隱的；票上的字樣，小號印有「蘇浙皖印花稅票，」英文價值和眞的印得差不多，例如一分的印着Cent，一元的印着r.Dollar。大號的除了和小號具有同樣的字樣之外，在上面並添着「中華民國」四字，這也許用來蒙蔽中國民衆的眼目吧？</p>
<p>所以，由於傀儡們的處心積慮，一般商人，允其孤島上的商人，對於印花購買上，却不能不加以澈底的辨別！</p>
<h3>投稿生活的一羣</h3>
<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>讀完了「投稿生活的一羣」使我非常感動，因爲每天確有个少「心血的結晶」，被我投入了字指　，但是這不同的一待遇一，事實上也有許多不得已的困　在，這是每一位投稿者應予以原諒的。同時，每一個副刋，是需要讀者，作者，編者携手起來的，我誠意地希望讀者們時賜教言，作者們給我寶貴的材料，不勝幸甚。　編者</p>
<p>每次，當報館裏發稿費的那幾天中，會計處的領款窗前總會擁擠滿了許多人，這些人中當然是靑年佔多數，他們挨着决序，一個一個地把稿費領了出來，有幾角的，也有幾元的，甚至有幾十元的；檢點過了數目，便笑盈盈地離開了領款窗前。這樣挨着擠着從開始發稿費的鐘點起，一直要到停止發稿費的鐘點止，在那兩小時時間裏，幾位會計先生只是忙不迭的接稿費單，核對稿費簿，結算稿費數目，忙得幾乎連喝茶的工夫也不會有。</p>
<p>大家把稿費領着了，於是舒了一口氣，踏出那報館的門來；但道些領稿費的人中，也有許多不同的心理，譬如有的人，拿到了那一個月的心血所換來的法幣，是準備去還債，付房租，買柴米的，有的却想把這稿費去買幾本畫，或添辦一點另外的東西。可是我相信目前的一般投稿同志中，應該屬於前者的多數。他們，有的雖有職業而收入不够，於是便把投稿作爲副業，聊以彌補。有的是失業朋友，自然唯一的出路就是賣文爲活，終日在那裏絞腦汁，嘔心血，以資養家活口，其情形的確十分悽慘的。至於後者，他們的舞文弄墨，原爲偶然與來之舉，至多也不過想挨得一點稿賽，去員幾本書讀讀而已。所以屬於後者的投稿者，大都是學生界。並且這些人不一定經常寫稿。</p>
<p>在上海投稿的人究有多少，實在無從統計起，但我相信靠投稿生活的人一定不在少數，因爲除了雜誌等定期刋物的寫稿者，及報館特的撰述釣不算外，上海還有可投稿的日夜報（大型報）十來種之多，道裏雖然稿費厚薄不一，需要稿子的材料不同，可是投稿的門路總究很多，像每種日報至少有兩個副刊，夜報也有一個剔刊，裏面所登的文字，不外是一般文藝作品，小品，隨筆，散文，雜文等，討論專門學術的副刊却很少。此外，報紙除了電訊版和一般通訊社供給的稿件外，本埠新聞，地方新聞，經濟版，敎育與體育，以及有價值的特寫等，都歡迎外稿，所以，投稿者只須擇自己最接近，最熟悉的一門寫作了投到自己所欲投的報館裏去。那未，幸運起來，也許自己也有被延爲特的寫稿的可能。</p>
<p>不過，上海雖有這們多的投稿門路，但失望的投稿者還是很多，因爲，在每一隻編輯先生的檯子上（尤其是副刊親者），每天總耍堆着至少三十多封稿件的信，這些信的命運，結果有大部份是　裁判入了字簏，一部份讓郵差帶還了投稿者，另一部分是由編者先生保存在抽屜裏，準備修改一下刊用，或等稿缺的時候登出，至於刋出的不過三四薦，佔全部份祇有十分之一。</p>
<p>呵！被裁判入字簏的，讓郵差帶還的，由編者先生保存的，在報紙刊出的，同樣都是投稿者的心血結晶，然而它們所得到的待遇却不同。至於，我們在領稿費時所見的笑臉，却想不到還有那些領稿費無份的悲哀！</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二回　林工師妙解標準化　金導員高談平等觀</p>
<p>他們正說笑時，只聽那邊有個女子聲音，喊道：「澹雲姊！你門從那裏來牙一！衆人　目看時，只見一位俊俏的女子，年的二十歲光景，胸前束了一條雪白的圍巾，是個女，侍者打扮，取了筷碟等食其走過來了。金澹雲連忙站起來道：「阿呀呀！靜妹妹，你父輪着這裹服務了嗎」？原來那位女子姓在，單名是個靜字，和金澹雲關着點兒親戚咧。在靜笑瞇瞇的走過來，向林建成點了一點頭，似乎是認識他的，對於何家兩位小姐却是初相見，不認得的。金澹雲連忙給她們兩方面介紹，還說：「那位汪靜妹妹，我們還是親戚呢」。汪靜便把菜單子遞過來道：「請你們點菜吧！這幾天裹也沒有什麼菜可吃一。金小姐接受了的菜單，她便轉身去泡茶去了。這時何家兩位小姐，有些納罕。余　雲知道她們的意思，便道：一我們這位汪靜妹妹，她也是這裹遺族學校的小學校敎師呢。她們不知如佝，却與這個餐　訂了一個交換條件，每一個月裏，要到這餐室裏來常幾天女侍者。或者小學的敎師，或者高中的學生，七八人一班，大概這一期也輸着她了」。何雙玉道：一我們從前在開什麼慈善會的常兒。也曾當過女侍者，這樣長期輪流的當着女侍者，却沒有過」。何　玉道：「女侍者的風氣，在我們廣東倒行了好久了，但是一向視爲賤役，高貴的人，部不屑去當」。金澹雲道：「這也是慢慢兒改變過來的。譬如像上海那個地方，各種餐室茶宰裹，僱用女子，也已久了。從前僱用女子，作爲招引游蜂浪蝶的食客之具。而且美其名曰女招待一班不良少年，常常說：「喂！我們去契女招待去！一！你們想：喫女招待，成功一種各詞嗎？但那班女招待也目取其咎，不過當初是這樣一種社會，無法處置。自從吾國戰後，男子有男子的事，餐室侍應等，全用女子了，還有那些色情狂的男子，，對於女侍者漂亮一些的，小賬特別加多。後來女子服務社，出了一張檬語式的傳單，貼在女子服務的各餐室茶室道：「付小賬與女子者，即是侮辱女子。」這樣的吿誡他們　。（二二）</p>

<h3>導演程步高的一席談</h3>
<p>— 聶格自港寄</p>
<p>名導演程步高光生在抗戰發動以後，他就離開了上海，加入了中央電影製片廠，盡力於國防片的製作，國防電影固是抗戰期中文化宜傳上的重要的一環；但因某些救亡工作更迫切的需要幹員的時候，程君就轉進了這個救亡工作的集團。</p>
<p>作者在一個宴曾中得晤到這位實踐救亡工作的電影藝人，我們從遠談到近，又談到他爲海上某些小報對他造謠生事的間題，對於這，程先生有了非常的噴慨，他說：在這决到香港來的機會中，他抽暇回到上海去探視別了一年多的家庭，因爲上海的家庭函電紛投，極盼他回去一次，但是他到了上海，雖是幾天的勾留，而謠言四起，對他和談瑛作種種不近情理的猜疑，一個正從事於救亡工作的人，到了在另一個勢力底下的上海，他的家庭又在上海，自不能標榜出他正是一個從事救亡工作的人，所以程先牛對上海某些報作種種無是生非　言，他都充耳不聞</p>
<p>上海的許多老友都請他留在上海，張善琨願以高酬請他加入新華，家庭中更盼望他留在上海，但是，爲了五千年的祖國，他不肯在戰事沒有終止的以前，放棄了救亡工作。</p>
<p>對於抗戰後一般影人的　落，他是非常的憤怒，他說得好：一抗戰好比是一面鏡子，那些卑鄙惡濁的，淸高潔白的，勇敢前進的，怕死消沉的，以至於漢奸走狗的民族罪人，都在抗戰發動以後把他們的形骸反映出來了！」</p>
<p>眞的，就文化界一環的電影界從業員而言，沒有發動抗戰之前，不乏高唱愛國口號的人物，然而抗戰發動了以後，最卑鄙惡濁的却泰半是這些人。反之，從沒有在口頭上標榜過獻身爲國的人，反在這决抗戰中參加了實際的救亡工作。抗戰眞是一面鏡子，它反映了每一個人的形骸，要想逃遁也不可能了。</p>
<p>程先生又說，電影從業員的生活是免不了帶點一　曼蒂克」色彩的，他在從前差不多每夜到跳舞塲去尋求麻醉，然而，現在他的生活走到了最嚴肅，最紀律化了。他忘去了一切的享樂，而事實也不容許他有享樂的時間。在上海，他出外不是乘坐汽車，就是人力車代步，而現在他多半是步行了，這是他一生中生活最嚴肅的時期。但他不以爲苦，他說：中國的歷史上有過幾次這樣有意識的戰事？這次是雪去以前的種種恥辱，討還歷决的血債，每偶人都應在這個時期刻苦的從事救亡的。</p>
<p>有些人對他作過這樣的諷刺：靠你程步高一個人參加救亡，中國就會有救了嗎？他的回答是：不是這樣說，我的個人力　固小，但合羣的力量便大，如果每個人都存着這種心理，那麼讓誰來作救中國的工作呢？</p>
<p>他現在担任軍事委員會政治部第三廳科長之職，戰時的月薪只一百二十元，他按月寄回滬上家庭七十元，雖然他的夫人談瑛在新華公司亦可自食其力的。現在他已轉道海防到重慶去了，與他同來的楊翰笙則已先他而行了。</p>
<h3>顧傳玠下月訂婚　未婚夫人爲—崑曲女票友</h3>
<p>顧傳玠是崑劇小生中的唯一優秀人材，過去自新樂府」以至蛻化爲「仙霓社一，他曾與朱傳茗合作過很久的時間，但「仙霓社」以曲高和寡之故屢决失敗，後來在某一决過程中，</p>
<h3>顧傳玠下月訂婚　未婚夫人爲一崑曲女票女</h3>
<p>傳玠便與朱傳茗同時退隱；顧　玠發憤攻書，並且恢復了他的原名「志成」，先進蘇州東吳，後轉學南京金陵大學，專攻農科，畢業後曾在鎭江金大所辦的農塲幹過一番「到農村去」的工作。砲聲饗後，纔放下鐮刀鋤頭，來至孤島。</p>
<p>最近，顧傳玠從銀行家嚴渭漁遊，生活相當安定，除偶應私人集團之請，登塲　弄外，大部份的時問是用在書本子上面，他預備將崑曲的工尺譜翻成五綫譜，庶幾便於一般人學習，這工作已完成了一半，將接洽一家書局發行。</p>
<p>顧傳玠的婚事，最近由「紅茶」編者胡山源的介紹，已經决定，將於下月三日舉行訂婚的儀式，他的未婚夫人姓張，是一位崑曲女票友，這與　傳玠可說是同志，自然是美滿姻緣了。</p>
<h3>天蟾舞台角色大更動　田少梅等明夜登台</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>天蟾舞台角色有大更動，除邀妥李如春，董志揚，志成昆仲，尚有坤旦田少梅，武生張雲鶴加入，定二十六號（星期四）登台，先演舊劇，劇目尚未派出。田少梅係初决來申，色藝俱佳，開出三天打砲戲爲玉堂春，賀后罵殿，六月雪，小三麻子等有脫離之說。該台接角主任張健飛，咋日自北平中國飯店三十五號拍來電報報吿，所邀角色，大致就緒，該台已於昨日由上海銀行電滙二千元赴平，當晚顧氏派員接名且黃桂秋到寓，商妥大局，立覆電張君，原文如下：</p>

<h3>郵政儲匯組　聯歡會的觀感</h3>
<p>— 高歌</p>
<p>上海市跟錢業業　聯誼會中郵政儲滙組的聯歡會，是在二十一日的晚間便公演話劇了，他們借定了寗波同鄉會的大廳來表現業餘愛好話劇者研究的精神。七點半左右便開始公演，所演的話劇共有四齣。第一個劇本是「紳士請客」，係偉藍導演，劇中寫一個貴族慳吝的家庭；第二齣「春兒」爲夏風導演，此劇是表現農村的破產。第三齣「白茶」由胡導導演；是描寫大學生因經濟的恐慌，連飯都吃不起，茶葉也沒錢買，但是他們還滿抱着救人救世的心理，預備救那些——賣唱生涯的女伶，受生活重壓的女裁縫。最後，自然是不能達到他們的願望：而他們仍舊的是飢餓與窮困，失望與灰心。</p>
<p>最末一齣是描寫上海灘上因戰事而失業的工人的悲劇，劇名「黎明」，爲吳銘導演。這失業的工人——福生因工廠被燬以致賦閒着遭遇到　痛苦的命運，可是僥倖他的妻子還有一個微末工資的工作，以維持這家庭重大的　負，但也只好說以補萬一罷了。</p>
<p>綜觀上面的叫個短劇，都各有　獨到之處，允共趁在最後的一劇「黎明及第二劇「春兒　更能將現實的農村與社會的慘態充分的顯露，而激發人們的同情。就整個舞台的燈光道具，與服裝而論，也是值得研究的，我們先談燈光，我說燈光便是舞台的第二生命，因爲日，夜，悲，喜，窮，富，等：不同的狀態下都可以燈光去配置，去表示，所以燈光的眾要是不减扮劇人的言語與動作。在這决燈光的配置是很精美，自然史能增加劇中的精彩了。</p>
<h3>記汪洋</h3>
<p>— 莫古夫</p>
<p>汪洋的名字，讀者大概還不甚陌生，因爲她的芳名，在藝華出品的「女人」一片中，掛得相當高，兹將其小傳列後：</p>
<p>汪洋本姓錢，名愛華，據最可靠方面消息，今年才十七歳，嘉定籍，自幼即富於冒險性，十四歳時即隻身來滬求學，名運動家錢行素，是其堂姊。</p>
<p>前年秋季，入藝華公司，任職接片間，供膳宿外，月薪大洋八元。時錢活潑玲瓏，一若依人小鳥，見者無不愛之。在「三星伴月，」「初戀」等片中，亦曾漏臉多次，然時人均無注意者。迨「八一三」戰事爆發，藝華停止拍戲，錢之生活，發生動摇，又回不得家鄉，正當其進退維谷之際，適有某公司開麥拉助手姚某，誘其下海伴舞，錢固不諳世情，即改名汪洋，欣然從之。於是始而國際，繼而大都會，百樂門，仙樂，名噪舞林，儼然一紅舞孃矣！</p>
<p>自下海以來，怱怱已一週年，最近錢語人，謂必須改變目前生活，蓋火山上討生活，亦甚痛舌也。去年冬天，藝華復業，汪洋仍任藝華演員，回復其銀幕生活。上圖是她初入藝華時所攝，一幅鴨蛋形的面容，依然不脱天真爛漫的本質。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army Strengthens the Guangdong-West River Defense; Large Forces Stationed in Guangdong-West River to Consider the Southern Route, Commanded by Xia Wei; Chinese Aircraft from Guilin Bomb and Destroy Three Japanese Warships in Beihai</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Chinese side has fully deployed military arrangements in the North River area and is now strengthening military operations in the West River and southern Guangdong to resist the Japanese army, adopting a large-scale encirclement strategy. Several divisions of the Guangdong army have been ordered to move to western Guangdong, also taking into account the southern route, commanded by two famous generals and under the overall command of Xia Wei. They are now arriving at their destinations one after another. Zhang Fakui also plans to convene a military conference at the end of the month with generals above the rank of army commander, including Wu Qiwai, Xia Wei, Yu Hanmou, Li Hanhun, Li Zhenqiu, Ye Zhao, Zhang Da, and Deng Longguang, to plan a counter-offensive. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guilin reports that the Guangdong authorities convened a meeting of guerrilla commanders from various regions in a certain place to discuss and coordinate guerrilla tactics. Zhang Yan and Deng Shizeng have gone to Guilin to attend. Zhang stated that it is highly possible that the enemy will land in Yangjiang, so they have taken strict precautions. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A report from Macau states that several Chinese planes flew from Guilin to the vicinity of Beihai and bombed the Japanese fleet, destroying three Japanese warships. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, 2,000 Japanese soldiers landed on Huizhou Island south of Beihai. Last night, the Japanese army bombed Shantou and the Huizhou area, and Danshui was also within the bombed area. Reports also say that the Japanese army occupied Huaxian, 25 kilometers north of Guangzhou. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, this office received secret information from the Chinese side that the Japanese army, continuing north along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, occupied Huaxian on the evening of January 21st. 2,000 Japanese soldiers have landed on Weizhou Island, opposite Beihai, apparently planning to establish a base there to facilitate a landing in Beihai. General Yang, commander of the Hainan garrison, informed guests that the Japanese army has not yet attempted to land in Hainan, and that the Chinese military authorities are prepared for anything. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to information received here, the situation in Beihai is becoming increasingly tense. In recent days, a large number of Japanese warships have been concentrating outside the port of Beihai, and Japanese aircraft have been continuously flying reconnaissance and bombing missions over Beihai, Dianbai, Nanning, and Wuzhou. This proves that the Japanese invasion of Guangxi is imminent. A senior Chinese official recently told reporters that the Japanese army does indeed intend to invade Guangxi Province from the Beihai area in the near future. However, the Chinese army has sufficient troop deployments and strong fortifications on all fronts, and if the Japanese dare to invade, they will certainly inflict heavy damage. According to Chinese sources, there are currently a total of 23 Japanese warships concentrated on Weizhou Island, opposite Beihai, including three aircraft carriers, five cruisers, and other destroyers and transport ships. There are more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers on Weizhou Island. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources, the fighting in the suburbs of Guangzhou is becoming increasingly fierce. The sounds of gunfire can be heard in Guangzhou City from time to time. According to unconfirmed reports, the Chinese military authorities, in order to unify command of the military power in Guangdong Province, appointed General Zhang Fakui as the commander-in-chief of all army corps in Guangdong yesterday. General Zhang was originally the leader of the Iron Army and has an excellent war record. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Chinese army in the North River area is continuing to attack the Japanese army along the Shiling line in Huaxian and is forcing the Japanese army on the Yuehan Railway line to retreat south. The fighting in the West River area is currently most intense around Lubao. The Japanese army attacking Lubao added over a thousand troops yesterday, and their intention seems to be to launch a westward attack on Sihui from Lubao, thereby threatening the Chinese army in the Zhaoqing area. (Decisive News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, General Zhang Fakui will convene a meeting of commanders of various guerrilla areas in a certain place in northern Guangdong in early next month to discuss future guerrilla strategies. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Still Attempts to Invade Guangdong, Shanxi, and Hubei; The Chinese Army's Forward Deployment is Strict; Japanese Army in Western Shanxi Has Been Repelled</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Telecommunications, as of last night, the general situation in various places was quiet and there was no fierce fighting, but local contacts were still intense. Judging from the Japanese army's troop movements, they are still attempting to invade Guangdong, Shanxi, and Hubei on three fronts. The Chinese army's forward deployment is strict to prevent and await them. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shaanxi reports that the Japanese army attacking the Great Wall line in western Shanxi has been repelled. There are still contacts near Helv, Jixian, and Quwo. Fighting has also been taking place in the border area between Hebei and Chahar for several days. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Pingjiang This office received a telegram from a certain unit in northern Jiangxi stating that the Japanese army on the north bank of the Xiu River has been constantly shelling southward, all of which is for harassment purposes. The Japanese army there seems to have a mobile artillery unit, with a limited number of cannons and frequently changing positions, so they are putting on a show of force. Although the Japanese army has adopted an encirclement attitude towards the Chinese guerrilla area in Mount Lu, there are no active preparations for a large-scale attack. (Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) There is currently fierce fighting near Zhongxiang southwest and Yuejiakou northeast of Qianjiang on the Hanyi Highway, with heavy casualties on both sides. The Japanese army's attempt to attack Shashi and Yichang westward is gradually becoming clear. The Japanese army in the Jingshan area is continuing to advance northwest, and their actions suggest that they will take the route through Zhongxiang and Jingmen to attack Yichang westward. The Japanese army in Tianmen will take the route through Qianjiang directly to Shashi, and then travel south along the highway to attack Fenxian in northern Hunan Province. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Miluo There was a rumbling sound of cannons on the morning of the 23rd, coming from Yuezhou. It is reported that the Chinese guerrillas attacked the outskirts of Yuezhou. A small Japanese warship and more than 20 speedboats arrived at the lakeside of Yuezhou on the 23rd, with unclear intentions. Also, the Japanese army has recently been building fortifications in the Yanglousi area, seemingly intending to abandon Yuezhou and use Yanglousi as a second line of defense.

<h3>A New Era in Southwest Transportation: Foreign Goods Arrive Directly in Kunming; Resistance Strength Will Increase from Now On</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a foreigner who recently traveled from Yangon to Kunming, it is now possible to travel by car from Yangon to Kunming via the new Burma Road. The cheapest way to transport goods into China is to transport them by water to Bhamo, a town in Burma 40 miles west of the Sino-British border, and then have them carried across the border by mules directly to Kunming. However, this method of transportation is not entirely suitable for all kinds of goods. Generally, merchants are very interested in this new road connecting Kunming and Yangon. It is expected that various goods going to and from China will be transported continuously on this Burma Road. It is reported that the Chinese banks are now planning to establish branches in Yangon to facilitate commerce. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Spain and the Far East</h3>
<p>A few days ago, the London Times correspondent in Tokyo made a comprehensive report on the Japanese reaction to the strong note from the United States, Britain, and France to Japan, respecting the Nine-Power Treaty. His words roughly stated: Japan will probably have to abandon some of its illusions; but with its many military victories in China, and in view of the actions of the omnipotent powers in Europe, it has not been without gains, and thus has something to aspire to. What the so-called "illusion that Japan is about to abandon" refers to, the original telegram did not detail; judging from the speeches made by Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita in the Japanese parliament some time ago, this newspaper has criticized them as empty and superficial, with no new proposals; compared to the repeated expressions of determination by Japan before the note from the three countries, the persistence in its delusions can also be said to be a complete lack of new awareness; then to say that Japan has to abandon some kind of illusion is still not credible. This is further evidenced by recent information, which states that Japan is organizing a huge number of new troops in Taiyuan and Taiwan, giving them special training specifically for dealing with Chinese guerrilla warfare; and on the front lines of western Shanxi, western Hubei, and western Guangdong, after a long period of silence, the Japanese army has recently shown signs of preparing to launch another offensive; thus, looking at it, the three countries' diplomatic actions to deal with madness and aggression in the Far East will be no different from seeing a thief committing murder and arson in one's neighborhood, bullets flying and flames spreading, and demonstrating barehanded calisthenics. To say that this is overstating the case, the Spanish affair is a clear lesson.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the Spanish Republican government and the National Army's forces directly affected Britain and France, as this newspaper's editorial yesterday discussed in detail. Even across the Atlantic, in the United States, an unusual threat was felt after the National Army's victory. The sentiments in the United States yesterday and the day before have revealed this without reservation. If the government forces' situation is deteriorating day by day, as it is now, then the "non-intervention" policy is weighing heavily on people's minds. So borders are closed, arms are embargoed, and a scorched-earth policy is adopted, waiting for the fire to spread. To say that the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States initially did not expect this is like seeing firewood but not a cartload, which is unbelievable. Not rescuing when rescue is needed, not rescuing when rescue is possible; now that there is a prospect of a rapid decline, how much longer can it be before it is too late to rescue! So they look at each other in dismay, discussing giving support, discussing lifting the embargo; clearly knowing that disaster is imminent, they are fearful that they will no longer be able to protect themselves alone, and haughtily say that they will definitely protect themselves. We have never heard of a strategy that allows the front lines to fall while only defending the door of the headquarters; but the policies of Britain, France, and the United States on the Spanish issue are like this strategy.</p>
<p>Are Britain, France, and the United States suddenly realizing the mistake of one-sided non-intervention? Are they terrified of the danger of close neighbors suffering the same fate, and supporting the Spanish Republican government? This cannot be foreseen. Even today, they are only using the lifting of the embargo as a way to aid Spain. Can they reverse the decline? It is difficult to predict. But a telegram from Berlin states that German newspapers believe that Spain's destiny has been decided! At the same time, what London and Paris are concerned about is Mussolini's promise to withdraw his troops after the victory and not station troops in the west or covet Spanish territory. The contrast between the two cannot help but make us shed tears of sympathy for Spain's "determined destiny"! Or perhaps we should not view it this way, as long as the countries of Britain, France, and the United States rise up to catch up, it is not difficult to reverse the situation. It is credible in theory, but probably impossible in practice. For supporting Spain now is the last opportunity, and it is also the worst situation; supporting it in the past would have been as easy as turning one's hand, but the opportunity has passed; supporting it now requires almost ten or a hundred times the strength of the past. Can those who sympathize with it bear this sacrifice and make this great vow? Because of this, we have nothing to pray for, only to pray that Mussolini will not keep his promise, to bless Britain, France, and the United States!</p>
<p>Regretting something that has already happened is the most lamentable. So we should take the Spanish issue as a warning and discuss the Far East. In the current situation in the Far East, there is only one dark shadow due to the Spanish affair; that is, as the Times correspondent said, Japan aspires to the fact that the omnipotent powers in Europe have not been without gains, and the possible misfortune of Spain is another gain for the omnipotent powers; will Japan not rejoice at this? Apart from this dark shadow, everything is bright. China has the advantage of time, terrain, and strategy; it has entered a favorable stage; and the morale and support of the people are being rekindled. Japan is exhausted, and is imposing an unprecedented budget of one hundred million yuan on the people; its troops are old and ineffective, its military morale is scattered, and it cannot advance or retreat. Internationally, sympathy for China has penetrated deep into the people, and hatred for Japan has reached a boiling point. Therefore, all circumstances are completely the opposite of the Spanish issue. In other words, restraining Japan now is taking advantage of the situation, like destroying rotten wood or pulling up weeds. Supporting China now is the best opportunity, and also the best situation. If this is not the case and we expect Japan to abandon its illusions, we can only expect the victory of China's resistance; but why should we let China bear the brunt of the responsibility for a long time!</p>
<h3>Imposing Economic Pressure by the Great Powers - Japan Deeply Alarmed - Hiranuma Declares He Has Countermeasures - The Eastern News Advocates Inviting British Cabinet Members to Visit Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) During yesterday's House of Representatives session, Prime Minister Hiranuma, in response to questions from Representative Yuya, firmly stated that Japan intends to implement an unswerving policy towards China and is prepared to counter the economic pressure exerted by the Great Powers with a plan of resistance.  The verbatim transcript of his response is as follows: The questioner asked whether Japan's policy toward Chinese affairs had changed since Konoe's declaration of December 22nd last year. I now especially announce that the declaration of December 22nd clarified Japan's unswerving policy. This policy has not changed or been revised because of that document. Japan must overcome all kinds of difficulties and implement its unswerving policy in any situation.  The questioner then asked whether the government feared the economic pressure exerted by third-party powers or whether the government would succumb to this pressure. I specifically announce that the government also has its own countermeasure plan to forcefully respond to the economic pressure from third-party powers.  I hope this situation never arises, but the government is determined to resolutely deal with such a possible situation. Regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, if a new government, namely the "Central Government of China," can be formed, the government intends to assist it and realize the objectives clarified in the December 22nd declaration.  Japan is prepared to relinquish extraterritorial rights in China. The government will proceed according to this policy, so that other foreign countries also relinquish their extraterritorial rights in China; this is a natural consequence. Hiranuma concluded by saying, "If a 'New Central Government of China' is formed, it is only natural for Japan to expand its assistance to this government." (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The close attention paid to the East Asian policies of Britain and the United States and the responses expressed in yesterday's Diet session can all be seen in this morning's newspapers. The Kokumin Shimbun anticipates that Foreign Minister Arita will invite British Prime Minister Chamberlain or Foreign Secretary Halifax to visit East Asia to gain a correct understanding of the current situation. The Miyako Shimbun stated that although Japan is now forced to resort to military force, it truly desires China to enjoy peace and prosperity. The countries guilty of invading China, namely Britain, the United States, and France, hope that they will eventually fully understand Japan's justice. The Kokumin Shimbun reviewed Chamberlain's flight to Munich, saying that Chamberlain or British Foreign Secretary Halifax's visit to East Asia would be very timely. Britain's supply of new loans to the Chiang Kai-shek government suggests a threatening policy toward Japan. Britain is clearly afraid that if the overall situation is allowed to continue as it is, Japan will ultimately control all of China. It should be understood that Japan's utmost resolve will not be shaken by the joint anti-Japanese action planned by Britain, France, and the United States. If British politicians are willing to travel to Japan, personally observe the reality of this part of the world, and have sincere discussions with Japanese leaders, their contribution to world pacifism will undoubtedly be significant.

<h3>The Japanese Economy in Dire Straits - How to Raise Funds? - The Finance Minister's Answer Was Vague</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese House of Representatives began its question-and-answer session on the 23rd. In addition to the questions from Constitutional Democratic Party member Toyota as reported yesterday, there were also questions from Seiyukai member Miyazawa. The main points were that reforming all government affairs, boosting morale, and establishing a wartime system are the urgent tasks of the new cabinet, but how to digest public bonds and revitalize foreign trade are prerequisites. Will the government compensate for the huge military expenditure in the past by increasing prices or taxes? What methods will be used to ensure the digestion of the huge amount of public bonds next year? Instead of restricting imports, how about revitalizing exports? What are the government's countermeasures? Finance Minister Ishiwata only replied that although the sale of public bonds has been hindered since October last year, it has gradually recovered this spring. Bank of Japan banknotes were issued to more than 2.85 billion yen at the end of the year, but this has now been reduced. He painted an optimistic picture of a bleak situation, while avoiding discussing the crucial points. Social Democratic Party leader Abe asked how the government intends to concentrate national strength for the so-called long-term construction. Hiranuma had no concrete plan to answer. Miura, a leader of the right-wing Toho Kai, asked why Arita's diplomacy was still compromise diplomacy and why the government did not adopt a proactive policy to deal with the "China Incident." Arita replied that there was an unswerving policy towards China, but there was no need to cause unnecessary friction with third countries. The first round of questioning in the House of Representatives thus came to an end. Judging from the questions from the various parties, their concerns about the future were clearly visible, while the responses from Hiranuma, Arita, and Ishiwata were still a set of clichés.

<h3>The Japanese Military is Consuming Enormous Resources - Few Troops Available for Deployment at Home - Military Advocates Extending Military Service</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to foreign sources, the Japanese government has no hope of ending military operations in China in the near future, but it feels it is very difficult to transfer new troops from the home country. Many of the soldiers in China are about to have their service terms expire, so their strength is increasingly lacking. It is now heard that the Japanese Army and Navy Ministries, in order to remedy the shortage of soldiers, have submitted a bill to this year's annual meeting to extend the national limit for first-line reserve soldiers. It is heard that the content of this new bill stipulates that the army's military service should be extended by three years, and the navy's military service should be extended by one to two years.

<h3>Japanese Legislator Proposes Castration - Advocates Racial Eugenics - Considers it a Pressing Need</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Two members of the Constitutional Democratic Party criticized the Ministry of Health and Welfare for being too cautious and slow, resulting in a lack of satisfactory results in the near future. Therefore, they plan to submit a bill on castration to the Diet. They believe that this case is now an urgent matter. A member who initiated the case said that this term sounds frightening, but after the necessary surgery, men can return to work as soon as possible, and women only need to rest for two or three days. Japan recently raised the issue of castration for eugenics for public discussion. Opposition arose from all sides, and the momentum was very strong. Therefore, the Ministry of Health and Welfare did not dare to act rashly, decided to conduct a careful study of the issue, and did not promote this legal system. However, dissatisfied with this, two members of the Diet decided to directly promote this move in the Diet and named their bill the "Racial Eugenics Protection Act" and prepared to explain the reasons for its introduction in the Diet and vigorously defend it. Among other things, it stipulates that anyone can be subjected to surgery after being requested by a proper official, parent, or guardian, and approved by the Supervisory Committee. The rules of the committee will prevent the abuse of this principle so as not to adversely affect marital relations. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>Churches Protest Japanese Bombing of Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The China Inland Mission, Friends Service Council, Methodist Church, National Bible Society, Seventh-day Adventist Church, and United Church of Canada sent a telegram to the League of Nations, protesting the Japanese aircraft bombing of Chinese civilians in Chongqing. The gist of the telegram is as follows: Our churches protest on behalf of the suffering non-combatants of Chongqing. The indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft on January 15th killed more than a hundred civilians. The bombed areas were not military targets. We request that the League of Nations arouse world public opinion to stop this barbaric behavior. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Commit Atrocities and Massacred Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) Recently, more than 270 overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia boarded the British De Gillies Shipping Company's Haimen steamer in Rangoon to return to their home country. Unexpectedly, on the 14th, when the ship arrived outside Shantou, it was suddenly encountered by two submarines, which ordered it to stop. A large number of Japanese soldiers swarmed onto the ship, tied up all the passengers, and brutally murdered more than 200 Cantonese overseas Chinese. The ship was covered in blood and gore, a gruesome sight. Only more than 60 Fujianese overseas Chinese were able to survive and reach Fujian. The shipowner was also seriously injured, and the cargo was looted. This shows that the violence and cruelty of the Japanese army are increasing day by day. (24th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Indiscriminately Bomb Luoyang</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) In the past week, Japanese aircraft have once again wreaked havoc in Henan Province. Tongguan, Shaanxian, Nanyang and other counties have been bombed one after another. Luoyang was bombed by nine Japanese aircraft this morning at 10:00 AM. After the Japanese aircraft invaded the city's airspace, they first strafed with machine guns, then bombed indiscriminately, dropping a total of more than 60 bombs. The four main streets of the city's commercial center, east, west, north, and south, and the Nanguan area were all ravaged. More than one hundred houses were destroyed, and the number of deaths and injuries already identified is fifty. In addition, the Swedish Christian Church on Beida Street, which had a clear Swedish national emblem, also had several houses destroyed by Japanese aircraft. This is another clear example of the Japanese disregarding foreign property. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Japanese aircraft harassed Tongguan three times today. The first time was around 9:00 AM, when one Japanese aircraft scouted over Tongguan for a week before fleeing northeast. The second time was around 10:00 AM, when seven Japanese aircraft were spotted by civilians and fled south. They passed through Zhaoyi and Huayin before reaching the airspace above Tongguan around 11:00 AM, dropping forty-two bombs in the city and the Dongguan and Beiguan areas, destroying twenty-two houses, and injuring only one civilian before fleeing. The third time was around 11:50 AM, when one aircraft circled over Tongguan several times before fleeing east. (24th dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Side Uses Assassination as a False Flag Operation to Coerce the Tianjin Concessions</h3>

It is said that the Japanese side intends to use this as a means to coerce the concession authorities, accusing them of harboring anti-Japanese elements, and demanding the inspection or blockade of the British and French Concessions.

<h3>A Puppet Regime in Wuhan is Difficult to Establish</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Japanese in Hankou are attempting to form a "Special Municipal Government" for the three towns of Wuhan, but due to the difficulty in finding "talent," they have not yet succeeded. Moreover, the Japanese consider Wuhan to be close to Chongqing and an important forward base for the Japanese army, so it is difficult to feel at ease without the cooperation of powerful Chinese traitors. In Wuhan, water and electricity facilities are not fully functional, and Japanese military currency is flooding the market. Therefore, Chinese who have taken refuge in the countryside still dare not return to their former residences. In addition, there are frequent disputes between the Japanese and the French Concession authorities, and the people feel increasingly uneasy, making it even more difficult for a puppet regime in Wuhan to show its face.

<h3>Miscellaneous News from Beijing and Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Beijing) According to Chinese sources, Japanese engineers have recently been engaged in surveying the opening of a waterway between Tianjin and Shijiazhuang. The purpose of this is to connect the Ziya River, Hutuo River, and other rivers so that Tianjin and Shijiazhuang can be connected by navigation. This was one of many important events discussed by the Japanese side and the Hebei-Chahar authorities before the outbreak of the war. Building a railway from Tianjin to Shijiazhuang was also one of them, and now a waterway will be opened between the two places to replace the railway. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Chinese sources report that the Tianjin Bank of Communications will be reorganized as a branch of the so-called "Joint Reserve Bank."

<h3>A Blood Debt Owed to Fishermen of Guangdong: Nearly Ten Thousand Fishing Boats Burned, More Than One Hundred Thousand Fishermen Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondent: Since the Japanese army invaded South China, the loss of life and property among civilians in Guangdong Province has been impossible to calculate. In addition to this, the brutal burning and killing of fishermen along the coast of Guangdong has been impossible to fully investigate for more than a year. The sheer size of the numbers and the cruelty of the situation are beyond general comprehension. The coastal areas of Guangdong Province are rich in marine resources, so the number of poor people who make a living by fishing, from Chaoshan to Southern Guangdong, should be over one million. Even in the areas near Hong Kong and Guangzhou, the number is around 300,000 to 400,000. The hardship of these fishermen's daily lives goes without saying. Since Japanese warships blockaded the Chinese coast, fishermen who went out to sea to fish were brutally killed by the Japanese army. To this day, the number of poor fishermen who have died unnatural deaths exceeds tens of thousands. This blood debt should also be one that the Chinese people will never forget.</p>
<p>Since the blockade of the Guangdong coast, ordinary fishermen, unaware of the dangers, still sailed out to sea to fish. Those who were lucky enough not to encounter Japanese warships were able to return as usual with a full load. Those who were unlucky enough to be encountered by Japanese warships were detained by the ships along with their boats and crew, insulted and beaten. The women and children on the ship were detained, and the men were forced to go ashore to buy food. Sometimes, the fishermen were also given contraband salt and sugar and asked to sell them ashore and use the money to buy food and vegetables to bring back. If they refused, the fishing boats were burned, and all the men, women, old, and young on board were killed. This continued for three months. The news was known to the people along the coast of Guangdong, and they all refused to sell food to suspicious fishermen. When the Japanese warships saw that their plan had failed, they left the men behind after detaining the fishing boats and forced the women to go ashore to buy food. This continued for several months. Fishermen along the coast generally dared not risk going out to sea again, or when they saw Japanese warships in the distance, they set sail and fled. The Japanese warships then opened fire or chased them with small motorboats. When they caught up, they raped the women, beat and humiliated the men, and plundered their belongings. By this time, most fishermen no longer dared to fish, and those who dared to risk going out to sea often never returned. This was the phenomenon in the early spring of last year.</p>
<p>As the spring turned into early summer, the activities of Japanese warships in the South China Sea became more frequent, and Japanese fishing boats came along to openly steal fish. At this time, ordinary fishermen, unable to make a living and with no one to turn to for help, could not sit and eat any longer. Driven by hunger, they had to risk their lives to go out to work. However, whenever they encountered Japanese warships or Japanese fishing boats, tragedy would strike. Everyone on board, regardless of age, gender, or sex, was brutally killed, and the boats were doused in kerosene and set on fire. Sometimes, the fishermen were tied up in the boats and then set on fire, burning them alive in horrific tragedies that occurred almost every day. Few were lucky enough to swim back to shore. According to unofficial statistics, since August 13th, nearly 10,000 fishing boats, large and small, have been burned in the Chaoshan and Southern Guangdong areas, and more than 100,000 fishermen have been killed or injured, with at least 10,000 to 20,000 dying at sea. Even in Hong Kong alone, Hong Kong fishermen who fished in nearby waters, their boats and people, were legally protected by Britain, but they were not spared from the disasters of burning and killing whenever they encountered Japanese warships. Sometimes, Japanese warships even invaded Hong Kong territorial waters to burn boats and kill people. According to a recent report from a Hong Kong fishermen's association, in the past fourteen months, a total of 1,092 Hong Kong fishermen have been killed, 628 fishing boats have been burned, and property losses are estimated at around 8 million. Hong Kong is a very small fishing area on the coast of South China and has British protection. The fact that so many fishing boats and fishermen have been brutally burned and killed is a testament to the horrific situation in other places, which is difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army invaded South China, the devastation of fishermen in various places became even more severe. When the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, Japanese warships gathered in the waters of Daya Bay, Dapeng Bay, and the Pearl River Estuary. Hong Kong fishing boats, even when working within British territorial waters, had no guarantee of safety. Tragedies occurred every day, and thousands of fishing boats were docked in the port, with countless fishermen starving to death. At the same time, the source of fresh fish in the market was cut off, and prices soared. The severity of the problem was obvious. At this time, Hong Kong newspapers suddenly carried reports that the Hong Kong authorities had reached a "gentleman's agreement" with the Japanese army to rescue the fishermen. The agreement clearly stipulated that Japanese warships should not interfere with fishing boats registered with the Hong Kong government and fishermen native to Hong Kong who went out to sea to fish. However, the Hong Kong authorities subsequently issued a statement stating that there was no "gentleman's agreement" signed with the Japanese side, and most fishing boats were still unable to go out to sea. However, during this process (about a month ago), there were no tragic incidents of burning fishing boats near Hong Kong. However, recently, there have been reports of fishing boats being burned again, at least twice a week. From this point of view, the Hong Kong authorities have not signed any agreement with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Currently, the livelihoods of fishermen along the coast of Guangdong Province have reached a dead end. In the past, the Guangdong Provincial Government had intended to provide relief and had proposed moving fishermen to the interior for resettlement, but this did not happen due to a lack of funds and personnel. As for the once-clamorous movement to arm fishermen and organize a maritime guerrilla force, it also became a pipe dream. Currently, fishermen in Chaoshan and Southern Guangdong have been unable to go out to sea for years, and their lives are unsustainable. Children are crying, women are weeping, some commit suicide, and others starve to death. The number who take risks or become beggars is also not small. Large and small fishing boats lie stranded on the beach, left to be destroyed by wind and rain, like waste. Some fishermen, unable to bear it any longer, are determined to be killed rather than starve to death, and they risk going out to sea. Few of those who can return safely are heard of. Moreover, these fishermen are different from land refugees. They have no farming experience and are not good at long-distance travel. Without the leadership of the authorities and a planned relocation, they can only look at the sea and sky and wait to die. Their situation is truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Four Japanese Soldiers Captured on Qingpu Highway - Japanese Army Burns Qibao Dujiaxiang</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondent: At about 10:00 AM on the 21st, a Japanese army truck carrying four Japanese soldiers was traveling from Qingpu to Shanghai when it was discovered by a Chinese army sentry stationed in Dujiaxiang near Qibao. They immediately launched an attack. The Japanese soldiers also got out of the truck and fought back, but they were eventually surrounded on all sides by the defense team. Seeing that the situation was critical, the Japanese soldiers knelt down and begged for mercy. The guerrillas then disarmed the four Japanese soldiers and escorted them to the team headquarters. On the 22nd, a large group of more than 50 Japanese and puppet troops, led by Jin Honggao, went to the countryside and saw the truck still on the side of the road near Dujiaxiang, six li west of Qibao. They went to the village to search, but because the guerrillas moved unpredictably, they only found a shotgun in Zhang Haisheng's house. They then suspected that Zhang Haisheng had colluded with the enemy and escorted him onto the truck. On the same day, another seventy or eighty Japanese and puppet troops, still led by Jin Honggao, went to Qibao Town to search, and a part of them set fire to Dujiaxiang, turning the houses in the east village into a scorched earth.</p>

<h3>US Closely Watches European Situation, Willing to Help Britain and France Strengthen Military, Jointly Resist Threat from Aggressor Nations</h3>
<p>(Washington) The world is paying close attention to the US attitude towards the European situation, especially the Spanish Civil War. Well-informed sources here recently stated that Britain and France are resisting coercion from totalitarian states. President Roosevelt intends to help democratic countries strengthen their military by more direct means. This approach involves assisting Britain and France in expanding their military, especially their air force. Regarding the Spanish issue, President Roosevelt is concerned that if the Nationalist forces win, the totalitarian states will gain a foothold across the Atlantic, threatening the Americas. Therefore, he is eager to express support for the Spanish Republican government. However, the President is still hesitant to decide alone on the matter of lifting the arms embargo. Legal advisors at the White House are also divided on whether the President has this authority. Military and political officials also hold differing views on whether lifting the arms embargo would be effective, given the rapid turn of events in the Spanish Civil War. Consequently, the US government has not yet decided how to respond to the Spanish problem. However, it is certain that they are paying special attention to Britain and France expanding their military. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Italy Pressures France, Paris Deeply Wary</p>
<p>(Paris) The rapid advance of the Spanish Nationalist forces in the Catalonia front is causing great unease in France. Political figures deeply believe that once the Spanish Civil War ends, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will formally present various demands to France and refuse to honor promises. He will maintain troops stationed in mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands in the western Mediterranean to exert pressure on France. The French government only hopes that Prime Minister Mussolini's guarantee not to covet Spanish territory will remain effective and does not intend to take any action. However, if Italian troops do not withdraw from the Balearic Islands, France will also have the right to send troops to Spanish Morocco and other places in Africa. The "Times," known for its moderation, also expressed agreement on this point, which is noteworthy. The newspaper also suggested that the French government should send commercial representatives to Burgos, the seat of the Spanish Nationalist government, and consult with Germany in accordance with the Franco-German peace declaration of December 6th of last year to avoid creating an emergency situation that would force France to take action. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers are closely watching the developments in the Spanish Civil War, many saying that the fate of Barcelona and even the Spanish Republican government is already sealed. The "Völkischer Beobachter" reported that Britain and France have felt "disappointed" regarding the current situation in Spain. The Berlin Stock Exchange Daily reported that the mechanized units belonging to the Spanish Nationalist forces must continue to advance and wipe out the remnants of the Red Army (referring to the government forces) until the last drop of gasoline in the tanks is used. The Red Army cited the events of Madrid as an example (referring to the Nationalist forces besieging Madrid for two years without capturing it). In reality, the power of the Nationalist forces is different from that of 1936. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Stimson's Letter to Hull: Sympathy for the Spanish Government; US Newspapers Publish Contents</h3>
<p>(New York) Former Secretary of State Stimson's letter to Secretary of State Hull regarding the lifting of the embargo on arms shipments to Spain (sent on the 21st of this month, but not yet released by the State Department) has been published by the New York Times. Stimson's argument explains the legal status of the Spanish Republican government and compares the attitude the US has historically taken towards foreign wars similar to the Spanish Civil War, as well as the US stance during the European War. He concludes that the embargo on Spain should be lifted, arguing that the embargo is not related to ideological differences, but is actually for the sake of the US's own interests. The following is an excerpt from the original letter: "The Spanish Republican government is the only legitimate government in that country. The governments of Britain, France, and the United States have all recognized it. This recognition transcends everything. Once recognized, it does not matter whether the recognized regime is communist, fascist, monarchist, or democratic. These ideological concepts are purely internal Spanish matters and should not be interfered with by other governments. Therefore, the Spanish Republican government, as a member of the international community, is entitled to all the privileges it deserves, the most important of which is to take defensive measures to deal with all kinds of rebellion and to maintain its power. Neighboring and friendly countries should also provide friendly assistance to countries threatened by civil war, allowing them to purchase arms to stop the rebellion, and should exercise restraint and refuse to provide assistance to parties that defy the law. This should be the obligation of all friendly and neighboring countries. To implement neutrality laws in the midst of a rebellion, before the rebels have acquired the status of belligerents, is fundamentally not applicable. The non-intervention agreement established by European countries completely obliterates international norms for limiting the expansion of conflicts. As a result, the legitimate government of Spain can no longer purchase arms in world markets. On the contrary, the rebels are not only not restricted in their supply of arms, but also have the assistance of Italian troops. How can this be considered fair? The US is in a different position from other countries. US interests are not directly involved. Arms purchases by the Spanish government can be allowed without fear of causing a crisis. Today, the Spanish Republican government has resisted aggression on land, sea, and air for thirty months. If the result is still failure, the reason is obvious: they have been deprived of the arms necessary for self-defense by various countries. At this point, President Roosevelt should immediately lift the arms embargo. In my opinion, the President not only has the authority to take this measure, but also has sufficient reason to do so in light of the international situation of the past two years. The original purpose of the arms embargo was to prevent unforeseen events from threatening US peace. Who would have thought that the impact of the embargo would instead harm US peace? As for abandoning our country's traditional spirit and hoping to avoid hostility from countries that disregard international law, I fear that this attitude is not enough to enhance our country's prestige and security."

<h3>Spanish Rebels Approach Barcelona, ​​Defenders Resist Strongly; Government Agencies Relocate, Preparing for a Last Stand in the Northern City</h3>
<p>Lérida: The Nationalist forces are advancing rapidly, taking advantage of the clear weather. The town of Martorell, fourteen miles from Barcelona, ​​an important intersection on the highway, is reportedly occupied by the Nationalist forces. It is also reported that two Nationalist divisions launched an encirclement operation towards Manresa yesterday afternoon. Last night, the Moroccan troops of the Nationalist forces approached the Barcelona airport in the southern coastal area, with the range of their artillery almost reaching the airport. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Lérida: The Nationalist forces have completely surrounded the town of Manresa and began attacking the city this morning. Tanks and artillery are covering the infantry's advance. Although the government forces' defenses are extremely strong, Nationalist forces personnel expect the town to be captured before noon today. (24th Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a dispatch from Perpignan received here today, the Spanish administrative departments have withdrawn from Barcelona and moved north to Girona or Figueres. However, the government remains in Barcelona and has not moved, and it is said that the government forces are still resisting the Nationalist forces. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to today's "Le Matin", the defense of Barcelona will be led by General Miaja, the hero who defended Madrid. It is reported that General Miaja is expected to arrive in the city by plane today. Everyone hopes that General Miaja can repeat the history of 1937, when he reorganized the ranks in Madrid at a critical moment, and therefore the city was not captured by the Nationalist forces. (24th Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Barcelona: Nationalist aircraft have bombed the city a total of 26 times in the past 50 hours. Air raid alerts have been almost continuous. The docks and the old city center have been heavily damaged. The atmosphere in the city is extremely tense, and many residents have fled. The government departments have also prepared everything to move elsewhere if necessary. All intersections on the main streets are heavily guarded by the military to prevent Nationalist sabotage teams from taking the opportunity to create disturbances. As for the front line, the war has at least temporarily stalled. The Garraf Massif is the last barrier for the city of Barcelona. The Nationalist forces' three attacks today were repelled. In addition, in the cities of Capellades and Piera, although the Nationalist forces launched fierce attacks on Martorell and Manresa, they were also met with fierce counterattacks by the government forces and failed to achieve their goals. The government forces are also rushing to build strong fortifications everywhere to block the enemy's advance. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian and German Air Forces Participate in the War and Indiscriminately Bomb; Many British Cargo Ships Hit</h3>
<p>Barcelona: Italian and German aircraft, under the leadership of rebel leader General Franco, carried out large-scale bombings today, sinking four British cargo ships and damaging four other British ships. After the rebels dropped dozens of bombs on the harbor area of Barcelona, ​​at least two British sailors were killed and many others were injured. The total number of casualties after today's air raid was 12. The coast has become a pile of scrap iron and rubble. It is expected that bodies can still be found in the rubble. The British transport ship "Yorkbrook I" was hit several times yesterday and was attacked again today. Because all the structures on the deck were destroyed by the bombing, it sank. Another British ship was continuously bombarded and sank at noon today after the sailors abandoned it. The ship had previously entered the harbor for repairs due to engine problems, but was suddenly attacked yesterday. Six sailors were killed in the second attack this morning. The British transport ship "Huntress" was bombed yesterday and attacked again this morning, causing 14 injuries to the hull. Fortunately, it did not sink. The crew area of the "Dover Harbour" was completely destroyed, and the hull was pierced by bullets in three places. The "Stanbrook," which had been bombed several times in the Spanish war, was bombed again today seven miles off the coast by the rebels. The extent of the ship's damage is not yet known, but it is believed that it will not sink. Two people were killed when the "Soulpepper" was bombed. In the past few days, British ships that have been attacked include "African Mariner," "Yorkbrook," "Huntress," "Dover Harbour," "Coast Sprite," "Stanhemen," "Soulpepper," and "Stanbrook." In addition, the French transport ship "Charles Heienic" was also bombed yesterday. (24th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>British and American Nationals Prepare to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Barcelona: British and American warships are prepared today to evacuate their respective nationals. The US consulate has warned American citizens to move to safe areas outside the city and has asked them to gather in Calella, 20 miles north of Barcelona, so that they can be transported by US warships. At the same time, British warships are also waiting there for the evacuation of British nationals. It is now determined that 30 British nationals will leave Barcelona.

<h3>British Cabinet Subcommittee Discusses How to Deal with the European Situation; Germany's Eagerness to Prepare for War Cannot Be Ignored; Berlin Denies Army Mobilization Next Month</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain met with opposition Labor Party leaders Attlee and Greenwood this afternoon to inform them of the recent talks in Rome between British and Italian cabinet members. He then convened an emergency cabinet subcommittee meeting. Foreign Secretary Halifax, Home Secretary Hoare, Minister for Coordination of Defence Inskip, President of the Board of Trade Stanley, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs MacDonald, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan, and the British government's foreign policy advisor Vansittart were all present. The discussions, which lasted from 3 PM to 5 PM, reportedly focused on the German issue. Since the dismissal of Schacht, President of the German Central Bank, the situation has changed. In addition, the German government has recently issued several military orders and concentrated all power in the Nazi Party, which must be watched closely. It is also rumored that the German army will partially mobilize in mid-February. It is said that once the Spanish Civil War ends, Germany and Italy will raise the entire colonial issue. Upon hearing this, Britain has been commenting extensively, saying that French Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to deliver a speech to the French National Assembly tomorrow, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a speech in Birmingham on the 28th of this month, explaining where "British resistance" lies. German leader Hitler is scheduled to deliver a speech on the 30th of this month, the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. The state of the international situation will be revealed at that time. (23rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the rumor that the German army will hold exercises in mid-February, a military spokesman here recently issued a statement to Havas denying it, saying that the German army, navy, and air force will not hold joint exercises until next autumn. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Calls on People to Join Voluntary Service, Preparing for Self-Defense to Prevent Disasters</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain gave a radio address last night to launch the government's campaign to recruit national defense volunteers, saying that this is a plan to train us to prepare for war. However, this does not mean that war is about to break out. He has done everything in his power to maintain peace for his country and for others, which is known to everyone. He will continue to devote himself to this in the future. Although Britain will never start a war, it may be forced to join a war started by other countries. If other governments believe that Britain cannot effectively defend itself, then Britain may be attacked. The more prepared we are to defend ourselves against the enemy, the less likely aggressor nations will attempt a victory that is by no means certain. Modern warfare is very different from previous wars. Since the development of the air force, the inland safety of the past is no longer available. Civilians will be the victims of war, no different from soldiers, sailors, and airmen. Not only that, civilians may be the first to be sacrificed. This is true not only in Britain, but also in other countries on the continent. Therefore, if we want to protect civilians in wartime, we must have the necessary organizational preparations in peacetime and have adequate training. If we start training only when the war has already started, it will be too late. Therefore, the plan to recruit volunteers is a common plan to prevent disasters, which is as necessary for our security as battleships, cannons, and aircraft. He hopes that people will read the national defense handbook, which contains words related to the entire nation, and will see that there are many types of services to assist public safety in wartime. All those who have not yet engaged in this necessary work are requested to choose one of the services that they consider most suitable for themselves and immediately receive the necessary training. People must know that this is a voluntary system. Some people have advocated a compulsory system, believing that compulsion is more effective than voluntarism. However, we live under a democratic system and have a tradition of freedom, so a compulsory system is incompatible with this. We firmly believe that Britain will be able to obtain the volunteers it desires without the need for compulsion. Today, most people are asking how they can help. Our suggestions to the people have given the people the opportunity to show the world how free people prepare to contribute to defending their freedom and ideas. He firmly believes that this call will be answered by the whole country. (24th Reuter dispatch)</p>
<h3>Spanish Refugees, Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young, Flee into France</h3>
<p>Perpignan, Southern France: As the Spanish Nationalist forces advance towards Barcelona, ​​many Spanish refugees have fled into France. The French authorities have decided to increase the number of gendarmes patrolling the border. When Spanish refugees enter the country, they will first be questioned and sent to designated locations for temporary shelter, and then sent back to their country in batches. In addition, after the Spanish Republican government decided to declare martial law in all its territories, Spanish Republican government officials here commented that this move is extremely important and that Catalonia's autonomous system has been temporarily abolished as a result.

<h3>Italy Conscripts Young Men into the Army; Standing Army Increases to 500,000; Navy Strengthens Submarine Fleet</h3>
<p>(Rome) It has been confirmed that Italy has conscripted young men born in 1901. As a result, Italy's standing army will increase from 300,000 to 500,000. Currently, the standing armies of other European countries are: France, 654,000; Britain, 218,000; Germany, 750,000. Italy's decision to increase its standing army may be to cope with the international changes after the end of the Spanish war. It is also possible that Italy has 73 classes of manpower that can be mobilized in wartime, totaling 9 million people. (24th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Naval authorities here have revealed that plans have been made to build 20 new submarines in the past, 14 of which are over 1,000 tons. Those sailing in the ocean have a range of 6,000 to 10,000 miles. Including the newly built ones, Italy will have a total of 47 submarines. (24th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign rumors that the Italian authorities have conscripted 200,000 reserve soldiers born in 1901 have been denied by the authorities here, saying that the number of Italian reserve soldiers entering training this year is the same as in previous years. Some of them belong to special units of radio and tanks. The bustling scene in the barracks in Rome is due to the upcoming 16th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party army on the 1st of next month, when a military parade will be held. At that time, 20,000 specially trained army soldiers equipped with the latest weapons will participate in the inspection. There is no other reason. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Will Visit Berlin to Woo Hungary and Yugoslavia; Diplomacy Has Been Successful</h3>
<p>(Paris) "Le Journal" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that, according to German sources, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to go to Berlin on the 28th of this month to hold talks with German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the situation in Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and Spain. When Hitler delivers a speech in the Reichstag on the 30th of this month, the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, he is expected to explain Germany's attitude towards Italy's wishes and declare that if France dares to aid the Spanish Republican government, it will cause serious repercussions. In addition, the Italian government recently sent former Finance Minister Volpi to Berlin to discuss economic issues with the German authorities. German Four-Year Economic Plan Dictator and Aviation Minister General Göring is scheduled to go to Rome in early next month to hold talks with the Italian authorities and then travel to Italian Libya in North Africa. The frequent contacts between the German and Italian authorities can be seen from this. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Eden Speech: Opposes Compromise; Britain and France Should Resolutely Defend Mediterranean Interests</h3>
<p>(London) Former Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in Coventry last night that the world can understand sooner rather than later that democratic countries cannot be confused or intimidated into ceding their legitimate rights, and that all parties concerned can benefit more. Developments in Spain are very worrying. In the current state, the greatest contribution that Britain and France can make to peace is to express their resolute defense of their interests in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. What Britain and France are most concerned about in Spain is respect for Spain's political independence and territorial integrity. If General Franco wins, it will be a victory for foreign countries. Some countries, although verbally claiming that they will not interfere in the Spanish war, have interfered to such an extent as to guarantee General Franco's victory. However, these countries say that if France dares to do even a small part of what they have done, they will reconsider the overall situation. I ask, can this kind of arbitrariness be the basis of friendship? (22nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Future Trends in German Diplomacy: Development Towards Eastern Europe, Detailed Analysis by British Press</h3>
<p>(London) The Berlin correspondent of the Times recently published an article analyzing the current state of Germany. The article stated that the future steps of German foreign policy are a matter of general speculation. Major clues will only be revealed after Hitler delivers his speech to the Reichstag on January 30th. Regarding the visit of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Warsaw today, although Germany promotes the principle of self-determination, it has not yet attracted all parties. However, Germany is in a position to demand active cooperation from neighboring countries in its Eastern European policy. Poland will first seek complete intelligence regarding Germany's Eastern European intentions before isolating itself from Western Europe and joining anti-communist causes. On the German side, Berlin may inform Poland about the redistribution of African territories within the Axis powers and national processes, assuring them that Poland's demands will not be forgotten when the time is right. As for the dismissal of the President of the German National Bank, Schacht, and the transfer of Hitler's confidant, Weidemann, to the post of Consul General in San Francisco, it is evident that Hitler and Ribbentrop's foreign policy seems to disregard any adverse effects on Germany's monetary future and aims to complete the maximum possible military preparations in the shortest possible time. As for Eastern Europe, being the weakest line of resistance, it is speculated that Germany will devote all its efforts there in the near future. It is said that Germany aims to secure its food and raw material supply first before confronting Western European countries, and will therefore focus its efforts on Eastern Europe.

<h3>Germans Purchase Land in Central America, Possible Naval Base, U.S. Political Circles Feel Uneasy</h3>
<p>(Washington) The news that a German, Eisberg, purchased a rubber plantation in Samaná Bay, Dominican Republic, Central America, has caused great unease among political figures here. It is said that the bay could be used as a naval base. The U.S. government once considered this and President Roosevelt personally inspected it during his cruise in Central American waters. The fact that the Germans now have a foothold there should be given attention. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-German Trade Relations: Distribution of World Markets, Britain Hopes for Reasonable Solution</h3>
<p>(London) The London German Chamber of Commerce held its annual meeting today. A large number of leading figures from British and German business circles attended. The German Ambassador to Britain, Dirksen, personally attended as chairman and delivered a speech, expressing optimism about the future of Anglo-German trade relations. He said: "The merits of each country's economic system can be set aside. It is possible for each country to meet its domestic needs through trade. This has been the case in the past and remains so today. We must pay attention to the evolution of the situation, adapt to the times, and ensure that each issue is resolved. In this regard, if the British and German industries can establish closer cooperation, it will definitely be of great benefit to the future of bilateral trade." (It is noted that the German Industrial Federation will conduct negotiations with the Federation of British Industries.) The British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, also gave a reply, saying that the difficulties currently faced by German commerce are due to the active expansion of military preparations. ... If countries want to develop trade, they must strive to improve the international situation and restore international confidence, which is a necessary step. If the current tense situation in Europe is not eased, there is no hope for the improvement of international trade. Our Prime Minister Chamberlain has repeatedly strived to resolve various international disputes through peaceful negotiations. It would be fortunate if other governments could respond with similar actions. I deeply hope that Britain and Germany can reach a reasonable and satisfactory solution to the issue of the distribution of world markets as soon as possible." (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt's National Defense Plan: Landon Expresses Support, Vinson Demands Appropriation for Harbor Construction, House Committee Begins Review</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to House Republican Majority Leader Martin, the House has formed an eleven-member National Defense Committee, chaired by Republican Congressman Vreeland, to review President Roosevelt's foreign policy. According to most observers, the Republican Party will be able to support President Roosevelt's defense policy, because the 1936 Republican presidential candidate Landon yesterday expressed full support for President Roosevelt's foreign policy and asked the people of the country to unite to prevent aggression by dictatorial states at a time when their expansionist ambitions are at their peak.

<p>(Washington) The House Naval Affairs Committee will hold a public hearing tomorrow on the Vinson Act, which calls for the immediate appropriation of $650 million. This fund is intended for the construction of fifteen emergency naval ports in the U.S. Pacific and Caribbean regions. Senior naval officers are currently drafting a letter to the Naval Affairs Committees of both houses, supporting the Navy's request to immediately arm Guam. At the same time, the Navy is urging Congress to quickly allocate $5 million to dredge Guam's harbor and for other improvements on the island. According to the Navy, the development of Guam is not only beneficial to military affairs but also to commerce. In the Caribbean region, there are also two naval bases awaiting armament: Great Corn Island and Fonseca Bay. These are both leases concluded between the United States and Nicaragua in 1914, with a term of 99 years. After these two places are armed, the Panama Canal and the proposed Nicaragua Canal will be protected. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>

<h3>The Caliphate Issue</h3>
<p>(London) The title of Caliph of Islam has historically been held by the Turkish Emperor, who, in addition to holding religious authority, also exercised jurisdiction over the Islamic holy sites. However, since the Turkish Revolution, this relationship has disappeared. Recently, there has been talk of King Farouk II of Egypt assuming the position of Caliph. British officials have not received any definite information and refuse to comment, but Arab人士 here are very interested after hearing the news. The Egyptian royal family has hoped that King Farouk would assume the position of Caliph for some time. The obstacle lies in the long-standing custom that anyone who assumes the position of Caliph should not only be in a leading position in religion, but also be the head of state in the administration of the Islamic holy sites, namely Medina and Mecca in the Hejaz, and Jerusalem in Palestine. Therefore, if the King of Egypt were to be the Caliph, it would have a great impact on the Hejaz. Regarding this, King Ibn Saud of the Hejaz has not expressed his support so far. According to人士 in the Hejaz, the representatives of the Arab countries are currently gathered in the Egyptian capital, but their purpose is only to make a pilgrimage, and they have no right to elect a Caliph. Moreover, if the election of a Caliph is inevitable, it should be jointly participated in by representatives of Muslims from all over the world, and should not be done solely by representatives of the Arab nationalities. Moreover, the Caliphate system was originally a relic of the former Turkish Empire. Now that the Turkish Empire has disintegrated, even if one wants to restore this system, it is difficult to force other countries of the Arab nationalities to submit to it. Therefore, it is generally believed that if one wants to promote cooperation among the countries of the Arab nationalities, one should find other more solid foundations than restoring the Caliphate system. The urgent task is to first make the people of Egypt unanimously love King Farouk, instead of eagerly seeking the support of the countries of the Arab nationalities. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Amidst Japanese Army's Westward Invasion, Guangxi Province's Scorched Earth Policy: Japanese Army Attempts to Invade Guangxi in Three Routes, Guangxi Evacuates Population and Destroys Highways</h3>
<p>Guangxi Correspondence: Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Japanese army's forces have extended to the Sanshui River estuary and Makou area of the West River for more than two months. The Chinese and Japanese armies have formed a state of confrontation in the West River area. Guangxi Province is located upstream of the West River. Since the Sanshui River estuary was occupied by the Japanese army, the Japanese fleet has also frequently appeared in Beihai of Qinzhou and Lianzhou. In the past week, more than 20 large and small Japanese warships have gathered in the Beihai waters, and have occupied Weizhou Island, which is more than 20 miles away from Beihai waters, and opened up a large airfield. According to information obtained by the Guangxi authorities, it is said that the Japanese army is preparing to divide its troops into three routes to invade Guangxi Province. One route is to advance from Sanshui in the West River, first take Zhaoqing as a stronghold, and then advance up the river to attack Wuzhou. The second route is to advance from Sihui and Guangning to Huaiji, bypass Babu and Hexian, and attack the back of Wuzhou. The third route is to land in Beihai, pass through Qinzhou and Lianzhou, and attack Nanning. In recent weeks, the Japanese troops on the above three routes have slightly increased. The number of troops in the Sanshui River estuary has increased to more than 3,000 including those previously stationed. The vanguard of the Japanese army in the Sihui area has advanced to Langgang Market, separated from the Chinese army by only a small river, facing each other. It is only 35 miles away from the county seat of Sihui. If Sihui is lost, Guangning will also be in danger, and the impact will inevitably extend to Huaiji. It can be seen that the situation in the West River is gradually becoming tight. However, the Guangxi authorities have long prepared defenses for national defense. After Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi returned to Guangxi, more precise planning was made for the coordination of arms and the replenishment of equipment. Generally speaking, preparations for resistance are divided into two aspects: active and passive. The active aspect is roughly to enrich all military preparations. This matter is related to military secrets, and outsiders should not know the details. The passive aspects are roughly: (1) All women, children, and the elderly in cities, towns, and villages within 30 miles of both banks of the river from Wuzhou to Nanning are evacuated to other areas. Grains, miscellaneous grains, kerosene, raw oil, medicinal materials, and other items stored in cities, towns, and villages on both sides of the coast are only allowed to retain enough for the use of residents of each city, town, and village for one month. If there is any surplus, it must be transported to areas more than 30 miles away. (2) All roads in Guangxi Province, except for the main trunk lines (i.e., the Guilin-Liuzhou-Nanning-Longzhou line), other lines, such as the Yongqin Highway (Nanning to Qinzhou), the Guilin-Yulin Highway (Guixian to Yulin), the Wubo Highway (Pingnan Wulin Market to Bobai), the Rongcang Highway (Rongxian to Cangwu), and the Yulu Highway (Yulin to Luchuan), are all destroyed. In addition, the highways from Guangxi Province to Lingshan, Lianjiang, Huaxian, and Hepu, which are connected to Guangdong, are also completely destroyed, starting from January 1st. Residents near each highway, from the age of 15 to 50, regardless of gender, must be conscripted to undertake road destruction work. Therefore, every day on each road, there are more than 10,000 male and female workers engaged in destruction, which also shows the spirit of national mobilization. After the destruction of each road, no vehicles can pass from Guangxi Province to Beihai and Guangzhou Bay and other places. Only single people and horses can carry things on their shoulders and backs and travel along small roads. Fortunately, the治安 along the way from Guangxi Province to Nanning is good, and there is no robbery. After destroying the highways along the way, the residents of the villages within 30 miles of the highways, and the stored food, are still relocated 30 miles away in the same way as the evacuation measures along the West River. Buildings near the highways and village self-defense碉樓 are also demolished when necessary. This method is probably a kind of scorched earth plan.</p>
<h3>Central Relief Committee Sends Personnel to Inspect Western Yunnan Border Region: Plans to Relieve Refugees and Reclaim Borderlands</h3>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: Since the War of Resistance, the war zone has expanded and the number of refugees has increased sharply. In order to provide relief and reclaim the borderlands, the Central Relief Committee has specially sent its member Lin Chongyong to Yunnan to organize a Western Yunnan Inspection Group to inspect the situation on the Yunnan border to prepare for resettlement. Mr. Lin came to Yunnan in early September of last year. After more than a month of preparation, on November 2, he and the members of the group set out from Kunming along the Yunnan-Burma Highway, passing through more than a dozen counties including Chuxiong, Dali, Baoshan, and Longling, and went west to the Burmese border for more than a month before returning to the province. Now, the situation of his experience is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organization Process</p>
<p>The working staff of the group totaled 25 people, mostly scholars and experts. The work was divided into three groups: social, agricultural and forestry, and mineral resources. The social group was divided into social, border administration, economic, ethnic, transportation, and health items. The agricultural and forestry group was divided into crop, forest, soil, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and pest items. The mineral resources group was divided into geology, soil, and products items. The local object was mainly the territory under the jurisdiction of the Tusi of the three administration bureaus of Luxi, Ruili, and Longchuan in Yunnan Province. The inspection period was originally set for two months. However, due to convenient transportation, the work was able to be intensified, and the task was completed in fifty days.</p>
<p>General Itinerary</p>
<p>The group departed from Kunming on November 2, arriving in Chuxiong on the evening of the 2nd, and arriving in Dali on the 3rd, and immediately began to work in groups. Working in Dali for five days, they arrived at Huanglianpu on the 9th, Yongping on the 10th, and Baoshan on the 11th. Working for a week, they arrived at Longling and Mangshi on the 19th, and Zhaofang on the 24th. On the 28th, they entered Burma's Mujie, and on the 30th, they arrived at Mengmao. On December 5, they arrived at Longchuan, and on the 11th, they arrived at Mujie. The places they passed were all areas inhabited by blind夷. Each time they arrived at a place, each member of the group went in batches to inspect the work they were responsible for.</p>
<p>Economic Status</p>
<p>It is said that the natural conditions in the border areas of western Yunnan are excellent, with beautiful mountains and rivers and majestic atmosphere. They are simply unlike barbarian lands. The climate is between temperate and tropical, which is better than inland and Nanyang areas. The cultivated land in the two basins of Mangshi and Longchuan is comparable to that of Kunming. Crops such as rice, cotton, tea, tobacco, and vegetables can be planted on a large scale. Animal husbandry and sericulture are easier to develop. Minerals are abundant and very easy to develop. The local土人 technology is immature, and they work less than four hours a day, while the income they receive is far above that of inland farmers. Its wealth and convenience can be imagined. The population in each area is less than 12,000. Calculated together in the three areas, there are only 670,000 people. Therefore, transporting refugees here to engage in development is the best ideal place. Moreover, the completion of the near highway makes all places accessible and unimpeded, and transportation is convenient and accessible everywhere. There is no problem for transporting. However, the瘴氣 in the area is indeed quite serious, but if large-scale development and sanitary equipment are inevitable, it is also very easy to eliminate.</p>
<p>Ethnic Issues</p>
<p>Ethnic issues, the area is known for its ethnic complexity, with a total of four ethnic groups, including Baiyi, Shántóu, Bēngtóng, and Biāobiāo. The Shántóu are the most barbaric and fierce, often committing murder and plunder. The Baiyi are docile in nature, and the beauty of the Yi women has always been intoxicating. The concept of chastity is more civilized than that of the Han people. Even before marriage, they can freely pursue the opposite sex to seek sexual comfort. They are often seen on Shántóu ridges, using flute playing as a sign of courtship. Whoever they are fond of will immediately seek to resolve sexual desire, and their parents will never interfere. However, after marriage, they are absolutely committed to chastity. They are especially responsible for economic production and never rely on men, so there is no so-called disregard for women. If this ethnic group is educated, the future is limitless. As for the Bēngtóng and Biāobiāo, they are not as large as the Baiyi and Shántóu, and their nature is also docile, making them easier to be 感化. In reality, the ethnic issue in the Yunnan border is actually the Shántóu road issue. However, if taught properly, it is not difficult to 感化 them. Because of their brave and fierce nature, training them to be soldiers to resist Japan can be of great help to the country. Moreover, the area borders Burma, and it is even more necessary to train them to defend the border.</p>
<p>Political Situation</p>
<p>In addition to the main counties in the Yunnan border areas that have county seats, the rest are administration bureaus and Tusi. The Tusi and local council are the masters of a place, with the greatest power. Therefore, fraud and exploitation are inevitable. Moreover, the area is located on the border, transportation is inconvenient, and supervision by the provincial government is difficult. There are many malpractices that should be thoroughly reformed.</p>
<p>The above is only the feelings of the group's inspection. The detailed situation will be available after all the materials are sorted out clearly. Currently, the working staff of the group, except for a part that remains in Myanmar for inspection, have all returned to the province. All the materials are being sorted out. As soon as they are sorted out, Lin will take them to Chongqing for reporting.</p>
<p>Work Assignment</p>
<p>The work of the group members is assigned as follows: First Social Group, leader Li Jinghan, Social Li Jinghan, Chen Maosui, Zhao Bo, Economy Chen Bisheng, Lin Dayu, Border Administration Lin Chongyong, Yin Huagong, Ethnicity Zhao Zhu, Jiang Yingliang, Transportation Ouyang Zheng, Wu Xueyun, Hygiene Yao Xunyuan. Second Agricultural and Forestry Group, leader Li Jidong, Agriculture and Forestry Li Jidong, Valuation Feng Zefang, Xiong Tingzhu, Guo Wenming, Plants Wu Zhengqi, Soil Song Daquan, Water Conservancy Wu Zunjue, Pests Zhou Shaomo, Surveying Zhang Hongji, Wu Zunjue, Zhou Shaomo. Third Geological and Mineral Investigation Group, leader Zhang Xiti, Geology Zhang Xisheng, Wang Jiayin, Minerals Zheng Duoxuan, Soil Song Daquan.</p>
<h3>New Strategy for Money Collection by the Kunshan Puppet County Government: Filling Rivers and Selling at a Price to Facilitate Japanese Army Car Traffic</h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: There are many rivers in Kunshan City, which are connected vertically and horizontally, which are either beneficial to ship traffic or convenient for drinking water and fire prevention. Because the inland has no tap water facilities, natural rivers are the only main artery of the city. Since the Japanese army invaded and occupied Kunshan, the main streets in the city have been filled with rubble, and no one cares. The puppet organization suddenly had a whimsical idea to hire workers to fill all the rivers in the city with rubble. The first to implement this was the river on both sides of Jiufang Bridge on Zhongdajie, which has been filled. Once a fire occurs, I don't know what method to deal with it. There is no public well in the city, so where does the water come from? Merchants are afraid of this policy of self-destruction and dare to be angry but dare not speak out. Secondly, the rivers in Nanjie have also been filled in several places. The puppet government has also issued a notice allowing people to pay for land purchase. Because the Nanjie area has always been a densely populated area, the land price is expensive, needless to say. Now the puppet side is planning like this, thinking that it can increase a lot of income. At the same time, it also plans to fill the Houbang River, the purpose of which is to widen the street and facilitate the Japanese army's car traffic. Because the Japanese army's Yifuban is in Fengchebang, and going back and forth to the county government must pass through Houhong. They have always been regretting the narrow streets. This move by the puppet organization is nothing more than a plan to please the Japanese. Now citizens Du Yuanshan and others believe that this method is really harmful to public interests and disregard民艱, and have jointly petitioned the puppet知事 to dismiss the proposal. I still don’t know what the result will be.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Traitors Publish Fake Newspapers to Confuse People's Hearts: Enthusiastic Elements Organize Anti-Traitor Group: Japanese Army Checks Pedestrians Very Strictly</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the Japanese army occupied Tianjin, they have repeatedly put pressure on the British and French concessions, causing frequent disputes between the British and French concession authorities and the Japanese army. Recently, the Japanese army has intensified its efforts and instructed traitors to create a Japanese newspaper (the Jiangdong Daily is one of them) to publish absurd news and sell it cheaply in the British and French concessions in order to 麻醉人心. However, in order to resist the traitors, the enthusiastic elements in the concessions are eagerly using mimeographs to secretly mimeograph small newspapers to report the true news of the War of Resistance in order to correct the errors of the fake newspapers. People scramble to buy and read them. At the same time, they also organized an "Anti-Traitor Group" to find out the whereabouts of traitors. At first, they would write letters of warning. If they were still obsessed with their mistakes, they would take further action.</p>
<p>The Japanese army and traitors in the city are uneasy because of the activities of the Chinese enthusiastic elements, so they have tightened their inspections. All ships coming from other ports must wait for the Japanese puppet inspectors to board the ship and check the crew and passengers one by one after reaching Dagu, and verify that the epidemic prevention certificate is undoubtedly questionable before they are allowed to enter the port. The only place where the British and French concessions and the Chinese界 traffic is a deep, long, narrow aisle. There is a Japanese soldier guarding the head of the道, and the traitors monitor and check the行人 coming in and out. Although there is no need for a pass or epidemic prevention certificate to enter and exit the Chinese界, they must take off their clothes and socks and stand naked in the aisle, regardless of gender, to wait for the people to search carefully. Even shoes and socks cannot escape their search. In this cold winter, pedestrians who come and go are naked on the道 and are all shivering. If they complain a little, they will be noticed by the traitors and will be punched and kicked by the Japanese soldiers. Pedestrians are only able to endure insults and be as silent as cicadas when being abused in this way. As for those who die on the roadside due to weakness and cold, there are not a few. The Japanese army and traitors also simultaneously check民居, knocking on the door in the middle of the night to search the house and go directly to the bedroom to check the number of people. If there is any discrepancy, they will be imprisoned lightly and killed severely. However, the guerrillas in the suburbs have not decreased due to the inspection. They often fight with the Japanese army in public. Therefore, whenever it is late at night and quiet, there are intermittent gunshots breaking the silence. This is the roar of the guerrillas.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang Japanese Army Invades Taixing unsuccessfully: Fierce Battle Between Two Armies in Tangjiazhuang</h3>
<p>Taixing Correspondence: More than 400 Japanese soldiers from Jingjiang, with four light machine guns and two heavy machine guns, attempted to invade Taixing in five routes. At 8 am on the 20th, they first attacked Hamawei. The Chinese guerrillas came out to meet the attack. After the contact lasted until 12 o'clock, the Japanese army was unable to support themselves and retreated back to Jingjiang. The casualties on both sides have not yet been ascertained.</p>
<p>About 70 or 80 Japanese soldiers from Xiannvmiao in Yangzhou attacked Jiangjiaqiao at about 4 am on the 20th. At the same time, another part attacked Zhangwanggou. They encountered the Chinese army in Tangjiazhuang and fought fiercely. Another 30 or 40 Japanese soldiers from Kongjiazhuang and Dahanzhuang attempted to attack the Chinese army's position at Zhuanqiao. After learning that the Chinese army was prepared, they did not dare to act rashly. When the two sides were fighting fiercely in Tangjiazhuang, the Japanese army in Xiannvmiao fired 20 or 30 shells to show off their power. At the same time, the Japanese army in Yangzhou also fired shells outside Dongguan to help. About 50 or 60 Japanese soldiers came from Yangzhou, and 20 or 30 Japanese soldiers came from Shaobo to reinforce. The fierce battle stopped at about 10 o'clock, and the Japanese army retreated to Huojiaqiao.</p>

<p>Telegram One:</p>
<p>Washington Chinese Embassy, forwarded to Mr. Stimson, Chairman of the "Do Not Abet Japanese Aggression Committee," with respect. On behalf of all merchants and residents of Shanghai, we express our sincere gratitude and admiration to you for initiating the "Do Not Abet Japanese Aggression" movement.

<h3>"January 28th" Approaches, All Circles Commemorate with Grief, Half-Mast Flag Throughout the City and Closure of Entertainment Venues for One Day, Japanese Side Alarmed, Implementing Preparations Starting Today</h3>
<p>The eighth anniversary of the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident is approaching. Various circles in Shanghai will commemorate with deep sorrow. All entertainment venues in the city will prepare to voluntarily close for one day on that day. The Japanese side, deeply fearing guerrilla attacks taking advantage of the opportunity, has accelerated the implementation of preparations starting today, blockading the ports. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Circles to Commemorate with Grief</p>
<p>All circles in Shanghai, taking the 28th of this month as the eighth anniversary of the Shanghai Incident, are now in a period of intense and comprehensive resistance. Millions of soldiers are fighting staunchly to protect the nation and defend the territory, striking back against the enemy. At this commemorative festival, it is even more alarming. In order to commemorate the martyrs of the resistance and the compatriots who died in the disaster, the entire city will fly flags at half-mast to express grief on that day. The city's frugal movement committee also advocates that citizens be vegetarians for one day, and the money saved will be transferred to donations and disaster relief funds. All entertainment venues in the city will voluntarily close for one day to express mourning.</p>
<p>Japanese Fear Attack, Intensify Preparations</p>
<p>The Japanese military authorities, deeply fearing that Chinese guerrilla forces will use practical actions to commemorate the anniversary of "January 28th" and launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army, are quite panicked. For several days, in the areas surrounding Shanghai, such as Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Longhua, and other Japanese-puppet garrison areas, they have built mat sheds and set up temporary sentry posts. On all major transportation routes, sandbags have been added and defensive works have been thickened. Their panicked and uneasy emotions are evident.</p>
<p>All Ports to be Closed Starting Today</p>
<p>In addition to intensifying defenses, the Japanese side has also dispatched warships and speedboats to patrol the ports on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River for several days. It has also been decided to close all ports today and reopen them after "January 28th" has passed. Furthermore, it has been decided to prohibit all ferry services between Pudong and Puxi, as well as small inland river ferries on the Suzhou River and Huangpu River. In addition, the authorities of the two concessions have decided to implement temporary preparations to maintain security within the concessions.</p>
<h3>This City's Rice Supply is Sufficient, Stockpiles Reach 700,000 Bags, but Private Smuggling Exports are Quite Rampant</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the concession authorities have been extremely concerned about the issue of food in the area, smoothing the sources of supply, regulating supply and demand, and strictly restricting the transit of rice from Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs, in compliance with the measures for food regulation during the emergency period, refused large-scale transit. Therefore, the import of rice into Shanghai is greater than the export. According to a survey by people in the industry, the current rice reserves in Shanghai are quite sufficient. All warehouses are full, and the stock of rice in rice shops is also piled up like mountains, with a total number of more than 700,000 bags. Moreover, the goods continue to arrive in a steady stream. There is no fear of food shortages for the citizens of Shanghai. However, Japanese merchants and merchants in North China have jointly formed a company to purchase directly from the producing areas, which is very active. Most of them are transported by ship from Changyinsha, Baimaokou, and other places to Yangshupu, and then loaded onto Japanese ships to Qingdao, and then transported to North China or directly to Japan, totaling more than one million dan. Therefore, the private smuggling of rice exports is still very rampant.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador's Wife Cares for Refugee Children, Praises the Gonghua Refugee Shelter, and Generously Donates</h3>
<p>The Gonghua Refugee Shelter, founded by the Education Committee of the Chinese Staff Association of the Public Works Department, was originally located at 27 Tianjin Road. Later, because the landlord reclaimed the place for his own use, it was moved to 9 Zhengxiu Lane, Kaifeng Road yesterday. There are currently 320 refugee children, and all education and upbringing expenses are borne by the members of the association. Recently, it has been learned by the wife of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, who deeply praised the enthusiasm of the members of the association for public welfare and the perfect management of the Gonghua Shelter, and generously donated 500 national currency to cover the expenses of the shelter. It is said that the association decided yesterday to use this amount as a fund for establishing a refugee children's library. The library is located in the Gonghua Shelter, but children from other shelters can also enter to read. Currently, the association employs more than a dozen teachers, and the education provided to refugee children is mainly practical. In the future, it plans to increase the number of refugee children to 500 and transform the shelter into a refugee education and upbringing institute.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees Continue to Receive Sassoon's Donation, Twenty-Five Bales of Cotton Yarn, etc.</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that yesterday (the 23rd), it was learned that Sir Victor Sassoon had sent the second batch of donated goods to Jewish immigrants in Shanghai. Sir Victor donated 150,000 yuan last year. The current donation consists of twenty-five bales of cotton yarn and rayon goods, to be disposed of by the local relief committee, either for sale on the open market or for the use of Jewish immigrants. Six bales, shipped by the Bombay office of Sassoon's Indian yarn factory, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, and arrangements were immediately made to be inspected and imported by the Jianghai Customs. It is said that the rest have already been shipped from Bombay and will arrive in Shanghai soon. Yesterday, it was learned that the main Jewish people in Shanghai have continued to donate, but the relief committee still needs funds.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Chamber of Commerce Telegram Requesting Resumption of Navigation, Fish Products Cannot Be Transported and Sold, Supply of General Merchandise is Cut Off</h3>
<p>After the prohibition of navigation in Dinghai (i.e., Zhoushan), East Zhejiang, the Dinghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed requesting resumption to facilitate freight transportation. The telegram reads: "To the Honorable County Chief of Dinghai, all ships in our county were ordered to suspend navigation due to incomplete registration procedures, which has been going on for a month. At this time of abundant fishing season, the fish products of our county cannot be transported and sold. Not only are fishermen and merchants facing a dangerous situation, but the social economy is also greatly affected. On the Zhen and Wen days of this month, we received telegrams from the commander of the Tenth Army Group stating that the registration of the Hana, Hai Fu, and Gaodeng ships had been approved, and also telegraphed the Ningbo Defense Commander to investigate and handle various matters. Since then, another week has passed, and we have not received an order to resume navigation, causing panic among more than 400,000 people. Fish products are bound to rot, and the supply of general merchandise is cut off. Therefore, we specially telegram requesting your honorable county chief to consider the public opinion, and report the situation to the Ningbo Defense Headquarters, and quickly resume navigation to provide relief. The telegram does not express the urgency of waiting for orders."</p>
<h3>Citizen Group Fundraising Association, Team Leader Meeting, Reporting the First Fundraising Results, Group Photo and Presentation of Commemorative Medals</h3>
<p>The Citizen Group Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association sent letters to all fundraising team leaders and deputy team leaders yesterday, scheduling a meeting for all team leaders at 2:00 PM on Thursday, January 26th, at the Ningbo Association on Yu Qiaqing Road, to report the first fundraising results, decide on various fundraising guidelines, and take a group photo of all team leaders and present commemorative medals as souvenirs.</p>
<p>Dingda Shareholder</p>
<p>Cai Shiqing, a shareholder of Dingda Zhenhao in this city, out of compassion for the suffering of refugees, in addition to recognizing donations during the Citizen Group radio broadcast, will now withdraw two-tenths of the current profit under his shareholder name, totaling 300 national currency, to donate to the Citizen Group as adoption expenses. He also solicited donations from Yuan Shunxiang and Zhang Rongji, 48 yuan of national currency, to adopt two refugees for one year.</p>
<p>Sea Cucumber and Bird's Nest Trade</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sea Cucumber and Bird's Nest Trade Association generously recognized refugee relief expenses for six months, to be paid in monthly installments.

<h3>U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Visits Along the River, Inspects Church Associations and Commercial Properties, No One on Board Saw Mines Along the Way</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that, according to responsible sources last night (the 23rd), Rear Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, sailed along the Yangtze River aboard his flagship USS Isabel, landing at Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu to inspect American church associations and commercial properties. After a hasty voyage to Wuhu, USS Isabel was moored in the Huangpu River at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The ship set sail from Shanghai on Wednesday morning, and all was well on the journey, which was to be a quick inspection of American properties along the Yangtze River. For this reason, formal calls on naval officers of other countries were omitted. Yarnell learned that a certain church was short of medicine, and gave the church pharmacy several boxes of bandages prepared by the USS Isabel. Responsible sources also claimed that the American flagship was not shot at, and no one on board had seen mines. U.S. Consul General Gauss in Shanghai and Mr. Herrless, Far East Manager of the United Press Association, also took the USS Isabel to Wuhu and returned. Mr. Meter, the Nanjing Manager of Standard Oil Company, also took the ship from Shanghai to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Salary Review Committee, Taxpayers Willing to Attend, Department Employees Dissatisfied Because No One Attends, Westerner Stewart Conducts Investigation</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that after the Shanghai Municipal Council established a salary review committee, other taxpayers intended to provide the committee with all possible information, and therefore requested an opportunity to attend and state their views, and have already made a formal application. At the same time, Department employees are also dissatisfied, not with the committee members or their fairness, but because</p>
<p>No Department Officials</p>
<p>Attend. Therefore, it is suggested that a number of officials equal to the number of merchant representatives should attend. The only connection between the merchants serving as members and the Department is Mr. Mitchell, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Appointments Committee. Mr. Mitchell was also a member of the Economic Committee, which greatly reduced the salaries of employees more than two years ago. The Department employees feel that at least two representatives should be allowed to attend, one nominated by the Employees' Union and the other by the Police Department.</p>
<p>Police Constables Nominated</p>
<p>Because police constables are not allowed to join the union, and their views may not be known to the Department or the new committee. So far, the committee has only begun its investigation, and the Shanghai Municipal Council Taxpayers' Investigation Committee organized by Westerners Stewart and others is also continuing. According to Stewart, a reporter said that the Merchant Representatives Committee does not pay, so</p>
<p>Reasonably</p>
<p>A report can be expected soon, because their time is precious. Stewart wrote to the committee, requesting permission for him and several other taxpayers to express their opinions. He received formal notification from the committee that his application would be considered at a meeting this afternoon (the 24th). The "Investigation Committee" has been supplied by the Department with</p>
<p>Recent Salary Increase</p>
<p>Various documents and papers, and is currently studying them, so it refuses to discuss any aspect of the matter. The reporter visited the committee chairman, Hawkins, and did not meet him. He then visited American member Gillilan again this morning. According to him, he began to study the situation after being appointed, so</p>
<p>It Seems Unable</p>
<p>To Discuss. As to whether the committee will invite members of the Employees' Union to attend, or ask taxpayers to express their opinions, he could not answer. It is said that the committee is scheduled to reopen this afternoon. So far, the members are still studying the situation from various aspects.</p>
<h3>Detained New Annerley Ship, Released, Already Docked and Unloading Cargo, This Morning Returned to Shanghai Directly From Ningbo</h3>
<p>The New Annerley, chartered by the American company Wisner &amp; Co., had not yet had its cargo handling procedures approved separately, and set sail from Shanghai to Taiwan on the morning of the 15th, and then to Ningbo. On the 18th, it entered the Yong River. The Ningbo Defense Headquarters detained the ship for violating the navigation order, and prevented the unloading of cargo. The shipowner asked Mr. Xie Baosheng, a well-known person from this city who was on board, to go to Jinhua to explain and request its release. Yesterday, reporters from the Modern News Agency learned from the Shanghai head office that after arriving in Jinhua, Xie met with Xu Zhigan, Chief of Staff of the ×th Army Group, and stated that the shipowner violated the order due to unfamiliarity with the procedures, and requested leniency in consideration of the difficulties of the business. Xu understood and ordered that the procedures be completed and approved, and then released. The shipowner immediately complied. The ship was docked in Ningbo yesterday morning to unload cargo, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai directly from Ningbo at 9:00 AM today. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tonight. If the docking is slightly delayed, it will be delayed until tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Team Intercepts Japanese Military Spies, Yesterday Near Chengjiaqiao, Five Japanese and Puppet Troops Were Intercepted</h3>
<p>According to many residents in the Hongqiao Road area, after the Chinese guerrilla forces arrived in the area outside the Western District of the concession, Japanese troops and Japanese puppet police in western Shanghai were often killed. At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, four Japanese people in plain clothes and one puppet police officer, each holding guns, were traveling in a sedan car from east to west. When they arrived east of Chengjiaqiao, not far from Zhongshan Road, they were discovered by the guerrilla team and intercepted and detained. At that time, the Japanese and others attempted to resist with guns, but were immediately surrounded by the guerrilla team and ordered to surrender their weapons and were tied up and taken away. It is said that the Japanese in plain clothes were Japanese military spies. The car was parked on the side of the road and had not left as of yesterday.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Search for Ramie in Shanghai, Transport it to Japan to Supply Military Raw Materials, Shanghai Stocks Have Been Exhausted</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that ramie is a special product of our country and is famous in the international market. The largest purchaser is Japan, because although Japan also produces hemp, its quality is inferior, so it still purchases a large amount from our country as one of the textile fibers. It has a strong waterproof performance. In addition to being suitable for making ordinary clothing, it is also suitable for making canvas curtains, nets, ropes, and paper. The sky curtains, canvas boats, military uniforms, ropes, etc. used by the armed forces of various countries are made of ramie fabrics. The producing areas are Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and other provinces. After the war, because it is related to military use, its export is prohibited. However, Japanese merchants are searching for it in Shanghai and other places at high prices and transporting it to Japan on Japanese ships. Last year, 11,000 metric tons were transported to Japan, worth more than one million yuan. The value of exports to Japan the year before last was more than 29.6 million yuan. Now the ramie in the occupied areas and Shanghai has been almost exhausted by the Japanese. Some unscrupulous merchants, in order to make small profits, are purchasing from Hunan, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other provinces, and trying to smuggle it to Shanghai to supply Japanese merchants.</p>
<h3>Shanghai City Bank Prepares to Return Deposits to Depositors</h3>
<p>There have been rumors about the resumption of business of Shanghai City Bank in recent days. The reporter visited the person in charge of the bank to inquire. According to him, the deposits of the City Bank's depositors have been approved by Mayor Yu to be allocated and returned by the Central Government. The procedures for preparing to return the deposits are currently being handled. Once completed, the deposits of the depositors will be returned in accordance with the methods prescribed by the Ministry of Finance. Hope that depositors will not be fooled into selling their passbooks. It is also heard that the Xingye Trust Company will also decide to return the deposits.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province's Postal Remittances Temporarily Suspended, Remittances to Hunan are Stalled, Shanghai Savings and Remittance Bureau Implemented Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau received an express mail telegram from the Hunan Provincial Postal Administration on January 23, stating that in order to protect remittances from all walks of life, it has been decided to temporarily suspend the opening of remittances to various counties in the province. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau stopped opening Hunan province remittances as of yesterday. All remittances to various counties in the province from Nanjing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Jinan, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Beiping, and other places are also temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Tonghe Ship Foreman Died En Route, Li Lange Died of Stroke, Jianghai Customs Inspected and Released</h3>
<p>The British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yangtze River ship Tonghe, now sails to the lower reaches of the port of Xinhang, Zhanghuanggang, etc. Li Lange, a foreman accompanying the ship, 50 years old, from Chaozhou, went out with the ship the day before yesterday (the 23rd). At about 8:00 outside the Wusongkou, the foreman issued small worker passes as usual for work. After the delivery, he stood in the aft cabin and suddenly collapsed due to a stroke. A certain watchman helped him up and sent him to bed. This afternoon, the ship was carrying cargo back to Shanghai from the ports of Xinhang, etc. At about 1:00 PM, the worker foreman suddenly died. He immediately reported to the captain, who telegraphed the head office. After receiving the telegram, the head office forwarded the information to the Customs Quarantine Office and his family. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 5:30. After the corpse was inspected by the Quarantine Office, it was taken away by his family for burial.</p>
<h3>Fengjie Sacrifices to Gods, Changed to Worshipping Qi Jiguang</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters believes that the Fengjie sacrifice to the gods is a folk custom. If it can be changed to worship General Qi Jiguang, who defended Zhejiang against the Japanese pirates in the Ming Dynasty, it can promote the folk custom of admiring former sages and conform to the customs. It is heard that the various god model shops have begun to sell the god model of General Qi.</p>

<h3>Japanese Suppress Foreign Trade in Yantai, Embassies and Consulates Seeking to Cope, Once the Situation in Yantai is Clear, Appropriate Action Will Be Taken</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the Japanese authorities in Yantai recently announced that export licenses will be issued for goods ordered before January 15 until January 31. Therefore, the Japanese suppression of foreign export trade in Yantai has been extended for half a month. However, according to the news from Yantai received last night (the 23rd), whether our foreign exchange regulations will also be relaxed in response to the Japanese temporary relaxation measures is not stated. The implementation of these regulations means that the sale of foreign exchange is indeed monopolized by Yokohama Specie Bank. If the Japanese continue to strictly enforce</p>
<p>Continuation of Strict Implementation</p>
<p>Its foreign exchange "official exchange rate", then Yantai will surely lose its prosperous lace and linen trade, which will be replaced by Shantou. Yesterday, it was learned from reliable sources that the embassies and consulates in North and Central America are still studying the report on the situation in Yantai. It is said that the information on the Japanese suppression of trade is neither complete nor clear. Therefore, the relevant foreign embassies and consulates will take</p>
<p>Appropriate Action</p>
<p>Once the situation in Yantai is clear. The Yantai news also said that the method used by the Japanese naval authorities in Qingdao to suppress the business of foreign merchants is similar to the method currently used in Yantai. According to the trade restrictions in Yantai, the office set up by the Japanese to control exports has the power to refuse to issue export licenses to Chinese and foreign merchants. This new restriction is closely following the already fully implemented</p>
<p>Control of Currency</p>
<p>New regulations are implemented. In fact, Yantai merchants cannot purchase remittances at the market exchange rate, but are forced to purchase them at the exchange rate set by the Japanese, which makes them unable to compete with merchants in other ports who purchase remittances at the market exchange rate. Although the implementation of these new regulations has been delayed, business circles in this city said yesterday that they believe that in view of the frequent Japanese interference, Yantai's import and export firms will</p>
<p>Find Themselves</p>
<p>Unable to continue to operate in North China. Earlier this month, Mr. Yamanaka, the "Deputy Director of the Yantai Port Office", a Japanese, published a notice in the Yantai newspapers, stating that from January 15 of this year, all ships entering and leaving the port must report the names of the passengers, goods, and crew members carried to the "Office". It is heard that after the implementation of this new regulation, the result has completely destroyed Yantai's foreign trade, and according to news from the area, Yantai merchants are pessimistic about trade opportunities in the area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Stipulates Measures for Passage Through Hongkou, Restricted Passage Time, Restricted River Crossing Locations</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of passage between the concession and the Hongkou area, the Japanese side had previously notified the prohibition of passage and closed the Waibaidu Bridge, North Sichuan Road Bridge, and Zhapu Road Bridge. It is now learned that the passage measures have been re-established by the Japanese naval authorities. Those who hold passes can pass through the Hongkou area from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM. The passage time for private cars and rickshaws is from 5:00 AM to 1:00 AM, but after 11:00 PM, they are not allowed to pass north of the Suzhou River. Chinese people who pass through the area in groups must submit their passes for inspection and have a police officer in charge. The inspection time is from 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM. The passage time for members of the Third International (foreigners) is from 5:00 AM to 1:00 AM the next morning. Those who pass through the area must abide by the regulations on the passage time. As for Zhoujiazui (near the fish market near Dinghai Bridge) and other places, passage is prohibited. It is stipulated that only private cars, chartered cars, taxis, carriages, and pedestrians can pass through the Waibaidu Bridge. It is stipulated that private cars, chartered cars (limited to private vehicles), pedestrians, groups of coolies, small carts, and rickshaws are allowed to pass through Zhapu Road Bridge. The opening time is from 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM. It is stipulated that empty trucks, private vehicles, carriages, taxis, and pedestrians are allowed to pass through the Sichuan Road Bridge.</p>
<h3>Pre-War Rented Chinese Ships: Japanese Merchants Attempt Hijacking, Violate Contracts, Refuse to Pay Rent, Chinese Shipping Companies' Negotiations Fail</h3>
<p>Prior to the war, Japanese merchants rented over twenty ships, including the "New Taiping," "Shunfeng," "Wuyang," "Huamao," and "Huaxin," from Chinese shipping companies such as Zhongwei, Jiping, Huaxin, and Zhengji. At the time, rental contracts were signed stipulating the term and rent, to be paid in installments. After the August 13th Incident, the Japanese merchants attempted to hijack the rented ships, refusing to pay rental fees and failing to return them upon expiration. The Chinese shipping companies negotiated with the Japanese merchants, but with the exception of the "Songpu" ship of the Sanbei Company, which had been sold to the Italian-Chinese Company and whose release was negotiated by the Italian consul with the Japanese, the rest of the ships yielded no results. It is said that the Japanese merchants verbally agreed to temporarily deposit the rent in a Japanese bank and return it after the war, but in reality, they were definitely attempting to hijack the ships for their own use.</p>
<h3>Job-Seeking Women: Don't Go to "Manchukuo," Those Responsible Have Ulterior Motives</h3>
<p>Those responsible have ulterior motives. Yesterday, a classified advertisement appeared in the "Personal" section of the English-language North-China Daily News, stating: "Warning" to young Chinese women: "If you are preparing to go to 'Manchukuo' and are being offered lucrative positions in foreign commercial firms in Shengjing, Shenyang, or Harbin, be aware of the tragic consequences that may follow, as those responsible have ulterior motives. Readers, please inform your Chinese friends about this matter." The person who placed this advertisement is to be admired for their benevolence, chivalry, and humanitarian spirit.</p>
<h3>Surprise Attack by Special Forces North of Dongtang Market, Changshu, Achieves Success: 70-80 Japanese Soldiers Killed, 13 Captured, 150 Boxes of Bullets and 40 Rifles Seized</h3>
<p>On the 21st of this month, over 300 Japanese soldiers of the Takahashi unit transported a large quantity of ammunition and supplies, taking a dozen or so small motorboats and civilian vessels from Changshu. Around 11 PM that night, they passed the Xiaojiaqiao area, about four miles north of Dongtang Market in Changshu County. The special forces of the Military Affairs Commission, led by Xiong, received intelligence and immediately ordered Zhao, the commander of the ××th Regiment, to lead troops to intercept them. Fierce fighting ensued, lasting for over ten hours, from 11 PM that night until noon the next day. As a result, 70 to 80 Japanese soldiers were killed, 13 wounded Japanese soldiers were captured, and two small motorboats, over 150 boxes of bullets, and 40 rifles were seized. On the Chinese side, only three soldiers were wounded and one was killed. This decisive battle was one of the most victorious guerrilla battles in the area.</p>
<h3>"Heda" Ship: Japanese Side Has Agreed to Release, Detained in Qingdao at the End of Last Year, Confirmed to Be a Panamanian Merchant Ship</h3>
<p>The "Heda" ship, a Panamanian vessel represented by the Norwegian trading company Wah Lun, loaded cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Fujian, then to Qingdao. At the end of last year, it was detained by the Japanese navy in Qingdao. The Panamanian consul then negotiated with the Japanese. This reporter learned from the shipping industry that after investigation by the Japanese side, the ship was confirmed to be a Panamanian merchant ship and has been agreed to be released.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Cables Shanghai Banking Association, Prohibiting Private Purchase of Gold and Silver; If Used as Reserve for Banknotes, Issuing Bank Should Be Notified First</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking and Money Trade Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: The purchase and exchange of gold and silver is a wartime financial policy. The Ministry has already designated the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China to establish gold and silver exchange offices, and to entrust commercial firms and other organizations to handle the exchange affairs. Jewelry stores and gold shops are no longer allowed to privately purchase gold and silver, in order to promote unified purchasing and prevent speculation and smuggling. However, financial institutions may still need to purchase gold and silver in the interior to provide reserves for banknotes issued by issuing banks. Considering that the purpose of purchasing is to deposit gold and silver with the four banks to back the banknotes, it can assist in the promotion of the legal tender and the exchange of gold and silver. However, in order to prevent abuse of the name for private gain, the following regulations should be established: Hereafter, if banks and money shops in various places have concluded banknote issuing agreements with the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and therefore purchase gold and silver as reserves, they should first report to the issuing bank with which they are negotiating for banknote issuance, and also report to the gold and silver exchange office or its branches, for entrusted processing according to the case. The exchange office shall supervise the process to prevent fraud. Those who have not concluded banknote issuing agreements, or who do not report for entrustment, or who do not accept supervision, and still purchase gold and silver, will be considered as private purchases for profit, and the Ministry of Finance should be reported, and according to the circumstances, the gold and silver will be forcibly purchased, or other sanctions will be applied. In addition to sending separate telegrams, please forward this information to all financial institutions for compliance, and first report the date of receipt of the telegram and the compliance situation to the Ministry for record. Ministry of Finance, Ma Yuqian.</p>
<h3>1938 Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial Report (Continued)</h3>
<p>(Industrial Accidents) A total of 1,513 industrial and occupational accidents were reported to the Shanghai Municipal Council throughout the year (1,976 in 1937, 2,200 in 1936). At the beginning of the year, the number of workers in various factories was less than in previous years, which is one reason for the decrease in accidents. However, as the number of workers increased in the second half of the year, accidents should have increased. The opposite occurred, perhaps due to incomplete reporting. Therefore, new methods must be devised this year to collect reports. Several hospitals, at the request of the Industrial Department, regularly submitted reports. Others submitted fewer reports. Based on the records for the entire year, reports received from hospitals accounted for only 38%, compared to 63% in 1937. The Fire Brigade Ambulance Division of the Police Department, as well as a few factory owners, also submitted reports. The Industrial Department wanted factory owners to submit accident reports on time, but the actual results fell far short of this goal. The worker mortality rate last year was higher than in previous years. Of the 1,513 workers injured at work, 88 died (58 in 1937, 95 in 1936). This shows that 6.1% of accidents resulted in worker deaths. The mortality rates for the previous two years were 3% and 4.5%, respectively. Comparing last year's figures with those of 1936, there were fewer recorded accidents last year, but the number of deaths was almost the same as in 1936. Workers in the construction industry (including building and road construction) suffered the most deaths, with a total of 21, of whom 11 died from falls. In addition, 16 transportation workers, 13 machinery and metalworkers, and 11 textile workers were seriously injured and died. There were 14 fatal incidents related to mechanically powered machinery, 12 fatal incidents due to electricity, 11 workers died in factory fires, and 29 died from falls. Judging from the above figures, it can be seen that falls caused the most accidents, with the number of deaths being more than double that caused by machinery. Transportation workers suffered the most injuries, with a total of 325, of whom 21 died. Among workers in this occupation, 76 were injured between 9 AM and 12 PM, and another 56 were injured between 3 PM and 6 PM. This shows that the congestion on the streets during the above times is one of the causes of accidents.</p>
<p>(Age of Injured Workers) Workers between the ages of 15 and 19 are most likely to be injured. Last year's percentage was 21.1 (26.6% in 1937, 26.8% in 1936, 33.3% in 1935). Workers in the next age group are also prone to accidents. Logically speaking, the age group with the largest number of workers should also have the largest number of injured workers. Therefore, it can be inferred that the factories in this city employ mostly child labor. These child laborers have come from the countryside not long ago, are unskilled, and lack experience, which often leads to them being sacrificed in accidents.</p>
<p>In various factories that are gradually improving, steam is needed to produce products. Therefore, the number of boilers and other steam-powered machinery installed in new factories is very large. For example, silk reeling factories, dyeing factories, spinning mills, and paper mills all use steam-powered machinery as their main tools. The Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations for the management of boilers have been in effect for over two years. During this period, 454 boilers and 45 other steam-powered machines have been registered. Among these boilers, 76 installed in various places north of the Suzhou Creek have not been used. Therefore, there are still 378 boilers that have been registered and are in effect.</p>
<p>The goal of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Department in implementing management is to ensure that all boilers in all factories have valid certificates at all times. A total of 193 boilers were inspected last year (including 33 in factories located on roads outside the Western District). Among them, 107 have valid certificates. In addition, 86 have not fully met the conditions set by the engineers. Although the task of supervising boilers has not been fully achieved, there has been real progress. If the Shanghai Municipal Council had not established supervision regulations, most of the boilers that are now being inspected by engineers would not have been inspected at all.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has registered mechanical engineers. Each factory must hire an approved engineer who is responsible for installing the machinery and ensuring that it is operated in a satisfactory and safe manner. Therefore, the safety of the machinery will be guaranteed in the future, and accidents can be reduced by preventing them before they happen.</p>
<p>(Boiler Operator Training Class) The Industrial Department held four boiler operator training classes last year. The last class had not yet ended at the end of the year. 45 boiler operators were trained. Including the students from the previous three classes, there were a total of 153. 21 people were trained the year before, each attending 12 sessions, each session lasting two hours. The content of the course included the structure and function of steam engines. In the current class, in addition to the 45 boiler operators mentioned above, there are also 45 foremen and other personnel who manage boilers, who have been approved by the Industrial Department to attend the classes. This group training method will be further improved and will soon be implemented for other types of workers. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Developing the Rich Resources of the Southwest and Northwest: Striving to Complete the Railway Network; Xiang-Gui Railway Opened to Traffic, Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Nearing Completion, Sichuan-Yunnan-Burma and Baoji-Chengdu Railways Actively Underway</h3>
<p>The Chinese government, recognizing that the development of the rich resources of the southwest and northwest must begin with the completion of transportation infrastructure, deems railways as the most important, as large-scale freight transportation cannot be undertaken without railways. The Ministry of Communications is determined to complete railway construction with all its efforts, while simultaneously building highways to assist the railways. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Northwest and Southwest Original Railways</p>
<p>The western part of China includes the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in the northwest, and the five provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi in the southwest. The land area of these ten provinces is 4.92 million square kilometers, and the total population is 100 million. In terms of railways, there are currently three lines. In addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which was established earlier, the completion of the other two lines has also taken place in recent years. The Tongguan-Xi'an section and the Xi'an-Baoji section of the Longhai Railway, as well as the Gejiu-Bisezhai Railway, were all completed in 1936. The three lines total only 900 kilometers. In addition, there is the Northern Sichuan Railway, which is only 22 kilometers long.</p>
<p>Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Completed and Opened to Traffic</p>
<p>The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway was originally the western section of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway. After the failure of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway, it was shelved for 20 years. In March 1936, the Ministry of Railways, in accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session, first prepared to build the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, dividing it into eight surveying teams. The entire area from Chengdu to Chongqing is a rich area of Sichuan Province, with a length of 523 kilometers and requiring 50 million yuan. In addition to forming the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to raise a capital of 20 million yuan, a loan of 34.5 million yuan was borrowed from the French banking syndicate for materials. Construction began in February of the previous year. After the outbreak of the war, orders were received to complete the project ahead of schedule. This spring, it will be open to traffic.</p>
<p>Planning to Build the Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Burma Railways</p>
<p>The new roads currently being actively planned are the two major trunk lines of Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Burma. The former runs from Xufu, Sichuan, to Kunming, Yunnan, and the latter runs from Kunming to Burma, forming a major transportation line between the Yangtze River and the Indian Ocean. The two roads are 1,500 kilometers long and are contracted by the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway Company. The company has a capital of 20 million yuan. Shen Chang is the director of the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway Engineering Bureau, and Sa Fujun is the director of the Yunnan-Burma Railway Engineering Bureau. Construction of the Sichuan-Yunnan Road has begun and is scheduled to be completed in two and a half years. The funds for the Yunnan-Burma Road are paid from the credit loan for the construction of the Guangzhou-Meizhou Railway in the British loan.</p>
<p>Xiang-Gui Railway Divided into Four Sections for Construction</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui Railway runs from Weiyang Station on the Yuehan Railway to Guilin, Liuzhou, Yongning, Longzhou, and Zhennanguan on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam, connecting to a branch of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The entire road is 950 kilometers long and is built in four sections: Hengyang-Guilin as the first section, Guilin-Liuzhou as the second section, Liuzhou-Yongning as the third section, and Yongning-Zhennanguan as the fourth section. The Hengyang-Guilin section is 300 kilometers long and requires 36 million yuan. After one and a half years of work, it was opened to traffic on October 1 of last year. The roadbed for the remaining three sections has been completed and is scheduled to be open to traffic.</p>
<p>Completing the Baoji-Lanzhou and Baoji-Chengdu Lines</p>
<p>After the Longhai Railway reached Baoji, there were two options: to go west to Lanzhou or to go south to Chengdu. The economic value of the Baoji-Chengdu line is greater, and it is the main connecting line between the two major railway systems of the southwest and northwest. It was decided to build it first. The road is 500 kilometers long and requires 50 million yuan, which was borrowed from the Belgian bank. Since the dispatch of surveying teams in the autumn of 1936, construction will soon begin. As for the Baoji-Lanzhou line, it was decided to start construction after the Baoji-Chengdu line is completed.</p>
<p>Xiang-Qian Railway, Zhuzhou-Xiangtan Section</p>
<p>After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company planned to change to the China Railway Company, it wanted to contract the southwest railway from Changsha via Guiyang to Chongqing to the company. Although this proposal was not realized, the Xiang-Qian Railway Engineering Bureau was established in June 1936, and it was decided to build the Zhuzhou-Xiangtan section first. The entire road is about 1,000 kilometers long and requires 160 million yuan for construction and equipment. Since the start of construction, it is not known to what extent the project has progressed. It is said that the construction of the road has been temporarily suspended due to the war.</p>
<p>Planning to Complete the Southwest Railway Network</p>
<p>The above seven lines are 5,000 kilometers long and require at least 500 million yuan. Today, the Ministry of Communications is determined to complete the five major trunk lines of Baoji-Chengdu, Chengdu-Chongqing, Sichuan-Yunnan, Yunnan-Burma, and Xiang-Gui with all its efforts. These five major trunk lines are 3,500 kilometers long. After completion, the northwest and southwest can be connected as a whole, and there will be three international channels: (1) from Kunming to Yangon, (2) from Kunming to Haiphong, and (3) from Liuzhou to Haiphong. In addition, it is planned to take Guiyang as the center, building the Sichuan-Qian Railway to the north, connecting Chongqing and Chengdu, building the Yunnan-Qian Railway to the west, connecting Qujing with Sichuan and Yunnan, building the Xiang-Qian Railway to the east, connecting Zhuzhou with Yuehan, and building the Gui-Qian Railway to the south, connecting Liuzhou with Xianggui.</p>
<p>Then Build the Northwest Roads</p>
<p>Then it was decided to take Lanzhou as the center and build the Shilanzhou section of the Longhai Road in order, connecting Shiji with Shicheng, the Baolanzhou Road from Lanzhou to Ningxia and then to Baotou, connecting with the PingSui Road, the Ganxin Road from Lanzhou via Hami and Dihua to Tacheng connecting with the Soviet railway, the Ganqing Road from Lanzhou to Xining, the Guanghan Road from Tianshui on the Longhai Road to Chengdu, connecting with the Baoji-Chengdu and Chengdu-Chongqing lines, and extending to Kangding to complete the Northwest Railway System.

<h3>Charity Lottery Drawing Advanced, Sales Break Record, Approaching January 28th Anniversary, Many Purchasers Buy Tickets in Advance</h3>
<p>The sixth phase of the French Jiji Refugee Charity Lottery will be drawn on February 3rd, two months ahead of schedule. There are only nine days left to purchase tickets. Yesterday, this reporter passed by Nanjing Road and saw that the sales department of the lottery's general sales agent, Dagong Enterprise Company, at the Guizhou Road intersection was unusually crowded. Its door was like a market, and the enthusiastic situation of purchasing tickets before the previous drawing reappeared before my eyes. The psychology of ticket purchasers must be delayed until the day before the drawing before they go to buy tickets in a flurry in order to improve their financial luck. Therefore, curiosity arose, and when I asked someone from the company, they said that the current issue was drawn ahead of schedule because there are not many days left, and with the approach of the January 28th anniversary, the concessions will be heavily guarded, and temporary transportation will be inconvenient. Therefore, purchases are made in advance to avoid losing the good opportunity to do good and get rich. The actual sales of tickets by the company have exceeded the record compared to previous issues.</p>

<h3>Servant Closely Follows, Secretly Reports to Police About Robbers, One Robber Shot Dead on the Spot</h3>
<p>A pistol and four bullets were left behind. The robber, Qiu Zhenquan, had committed many crimes. – Many robbery cases occurred yesterday. –</p>
<p>At around 7:30 AM yesterday, while the Jin Zhou family, living at No. 1, Alley 292, North Zhejiang Road (i.e., He Kang Li), was having breakfast, two robbers suddenly broke in. One robber, wielding a gun, threatened the people in the house and held them captive, while the other, unarmed robber, searched the rooms, stealing over 160 yuan in cash. They then called their accomplices and fled out of the house together, heading south along North Zhejiang Road and turning into North Suzhou Creek Road, hoping to escape. Unexpectedly, although the homeowner was a woman, she was extremely careful and resourceful. Taking advantage of the robbers' hasty exit, she secretly sent her servant to follow them closely. When the robbers fled to the intersection of North Suzhou Creek Road and North Xizang Road, where a Chinese police officer was stationed, the pursuer went to report the crime without making a sound. Upon receiving the information, the officer immediately drew his gun and gave chase. Suddenly hearing urgent footsteps, the two robbers quickly turned around. Seeing the police officer chasing them, they knew things were bad. The robber with the gun immediately raised it and fired two shots at the officer, but fortunately, he was not hit. The Chinese officer also quickly returned fire while chasing, firing a total of 18 shots, hitting the armed robber, who fell to the ground, shot in the head, and died on the spot. However, the unarmed robber, unfortunately, escaped into the crowd. At this time, the police department also received the alarm and quickly dispatched a large number of armed detectives to the scene to search the area, but to no avail. They then transported the dead robber's body to the morgue for examination and confiscated the self-loading pistol left behind by the dead robber, with the number N3160 and four bullets, and took them back to the police station for safekeeping. They also learned that the dead robber's name was Qiu Zhenquan, who had previously committed many crimes within the concession.</p>
<p>Robbery Foiled, One Robber Captured</p>
<p>At around 5:30 PM yesterday, six robbers suddenly went to rob a certain residential house at No. 113, Alley 727, Tiantong Road. Only one robber had a pistol, and another robber had a fake pistol. As they were about to enter the house, the female homeowner discovered them and went upstairs to lock the door, shouting for help. Seeing that the plan had failed, the robbers immediately retreated and fled out of the alley. Unexpectedly, the people in the house also chased them out, running to report to the police officer. As a result, the robber at the rear was arrested at the entrance of the alley, and a fake pistol was confiscated. They were all taken to the police station for temporary detention, and based on the information, the remaining accomplices were searched for in all directions.</p>
<p>Wanton Robbery, Escaping with Stolen Goods</p>
<p>At around 9 PM last night, six robbers suddenly came to the house of Zhao Zhou, a local woman, at No. 12, Alley 238, Avenue Poncet in the French Concession. Two robbers had pistols. After entering the house, they drove all the people in the house into one room and then wantonly robbed them. After half an hour, they each left with the stolen goods. After detailed investigation of the losses, it was found that clothing, jewelry, and cash totaling more than 300 yuan had been robbed. A list of losses was immediately prepared and reported to the police station, requesting investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Carrying Remittance, Robbed on the Way</p>
<p>Yu Hejiang, from Tongzhou, has long worked as a senior clerk at the Hengdali Watch Store on Nanjing Road. At around 10 AM yesterday, Yu was assigned to carry 1,050 yuan in cash to the Bank of Communications on Avenue Joffre for deposit. While traveling along Rue Pu Shi, several robbers suddenly blocked his way, threatening him with guns, robbing all the cash, and fleeing in different directions. Afterwards, Yu reported to the police station in charge, requesting investigation and arrest.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Accuses Manager of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Only Relying on Empty Words with No Evidence, Clearly a False Accusation, Detained for Interrogation</p>
<p>Jiang Shukang, an apprentice from Haining at the Jingfeng Yarn Store on Xiamen Road, recently filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against Liu Yingfu, a shareholder and manager of the store. The main points of his complaint stated that from the summer of 1934 onwards, he and Liu had jointly stolen a small portion of the yarn purchased in each large package when it was sold and sold it separately.</p>
<p>Embezzling in This Way</p>
<p>Up until the end of 1935, they obtained thousands of yuan in illegal profits. It was originally agreed to share the profits together, but Liu now occupied them alone, so he filed a complaint. However, during the court hearing, Jiang could not provide evidence to prove the facts of his complaint, only relying on empty words to claim, so the result was that the case was not accepted. Jiang was still unwilling and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. After interrogation by the High Court Branch, in addition to dismissing Jiang's</p>
<p>Appeal</p>
<p>And also because Jiang had a real suspicion of making a false accusation, even if it belonged to the facts, his behavior was a crime, then Jiang also committed a criminal responsibility, and because self-accusation cases have recently been found to have a false accusation nature, if not given appropriate punishment, it is not enough to warn efficacy, so the High Court in July of the 7th in court</p>
<p>Jiang was Taken into Custody</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Xu Dean on the 11th prepared a document along with the dossier and sent it to the Old Zha Police Station for investigation. After detailed investigation by Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and Western Detective Smythe, and investigation to Yingchang Xintai and other yarn stores that had been dealing with Jingfeng, they could all prove that Jiang's accusation</p>
<p>The Facts Were Inconsistent</p>
<p>Therefore, Jiang was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court in the morning, and the police lawyers Ru Bao Yi, Li Zhi Shan, and Chen Ming explained the process and prosecuted for the crime of false accusation under Article 169 of the Criminal Law. After detailed interrogation by Judge Feng Shide, the order was given to reschedule the case for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Women and Newborns Accuse of Seduction and Abandonment, Demanding 6,000 Yuan in Upbringing Expenses; Defendant Denies and Files Counter-Suit for False Accusation</h3>
<p>He Rui-tang (40 years old, native), owner of the Hetai Fruit Store at 1548 Avenue Joffre and the Futai Catering Company at 1749 Avenue Edward VII, was sued in the Criminal Division of the Special Court No. 2 by his cousin's widow, He Lin-alai (29 years old, native), acting as the legal guardian, along with her 20-day-old newborn son, represented by lawyers Wu Xiang-xian and Li Peng-cheng. She accused him of seducing her, causing her pregnancy, and then abandoning her, requesting a thorough investigation. Additionally, she filed a civil suit demanding that the defendant pay for the upbringing and education of herself and her child.</p>
<p>The Fostering and Educational Expenses</p>
<p>are set at 50 yuan per month, calculated over ten years, totaling 6,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Liao convened a court session and summoned both parties for a hearing. According to the plaintiff, He Lin-alai, she had already been seduced by the defendant while her husband was alive. After her husband's death, their interactions became more overt, with the defendant giving her irregular monthly allowances of 20 or 30 yuan. Last autumn, while she was working as a domestic helper for the Yao family on Weihaiwei Road, the defendant came and asked her to leave,</p>
<p>offering to take me as a concubine.</p>
<p>He instructed her to manage the affairs inside the new Futai store. Believing him to be sincere, she went to oversee the store's business. They cohabitated until February of this year. In May, after she became pregnant, the defendant had a dispute with his wife. He then told her to leave. Initially, he said he would rent another room for her to live in. However, after she left, he abandoned her and paid her no heed. He did not care even when she gave birth. Helpless, her younger female friends helped her</p>
<p>give birth in a hospital.</p>
<p>On the 3rd of this month, she gave birth to a boy, whom the defendant ignored. Attempts to reason with him through intermediaries were also ineffective, leaving her with no choice but to file a lawsuit. The defendant, accompanied by his defense attorney, appeared in court. He admitted to having a relationship with the plaintiff. He said she had lived in Hongkou but went to work as a domestic helper after the August 13th incident. She was dismissed by her employer for repeatedly staying out at night. She then came to him, pleading for assistance and offering to work as a servant. Out of kinship and pity for her plight,</p>
<p>I took her in at home,</p>
<p>explaining that she would be paid a wage. However, after less than a month, she began going out every night to see her younger female friends and eventually brought men into his house. Considering her improper conduct and the effect on his reputation, he dismissed her, paying her five yuan in wages. Afterward, she repeatedly came to him, forcibly demanding loans which he refused. Then, on December 4th of last year, she gathered eight men and three women, arrived in a car, and attempted to kidnap him, extorting money. He reported this to the Rue Pétain police station. The men escaped, but only the three women were apprehended and detained at the station overnight before being released. There was no</p>
<p>relationship with her</p>
<p>or any pregnancy or childbirth. It was all a malicious accusation out of spite, and he requested a thorough investigation, also filing a counter-suit for false accusation. After repeated questioning of both parties in court, the judge declared the case clear and ordered closing arguments. The verdict was set for the 28th. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were released on bail with their respective lawyers acting as guarantors, pending further notice.</p>
<h3>Pitiful Death of a Maid: Pregnant and Burdened While Working in Shanghai, She Suffers a Miscarriage and Dies Just Half a Month Later</h3>
<p>Chen Cheng-shi, a 24-year-old woman from Shaoxing, came to Shanghai alone due to poverty, relying on domestic work for a living. On the 5th of this month, she was recommended to work at 343 Rue de la Gare through the Chen De-ming (39 years old, from Gaoyou) employment agency located at 18 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. She had only been there for half a month, until the 20th. As she was four months pregnant and unable to bear the heavy work, she quit and returned to the employment agency to rest. Unexpectedly, the work had harmed her fetus, and on the afternoon of the 23rd, at 3 PM, she miscarried in the employment agency. Three hours later, she died from the complications of the miscarriage. Since the owner of the employment agency knew that she had no family or relatives in Shanghai and feared being implicated, he reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. Yesterday, a request was made to the Special Court No. 2, and Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic doctor arrived at the scene. They determined that the death was indeed caused by a miscarriage, and the body was handed over to the charity for burial, pending identification by relatives.</p>
<h3>Two Suicide Attempts, One Fatal, One Critical</h3>
<p>At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, a local man in his thirties was found attempting suicide by opium in a room at the Far Eastern Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. The tea boy discovered him and reported it to the police, who summoned an ambulance to Renji Hospital. Due to severe poisoning, treatment was ineffective, and he died around 11 AM. The reason for the suicide was reportedly due to economic pressures.</p>
<p>A woman named Zhu Wu-shi, 44 years old, residing at 430 North Jiangxi Road, had an argument with her husband yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Afterward, feeling despondent, she secretly ingested opium in an attempt to kill herself. Discovered by her family, she was sent to the hospital. She had reportedly taken too much poison and her life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Fierce Monsoon Capsizes Boat at Sea</h3>
<p>Three fishermen seek relief from the fellow villagers' association. Recent winds at sea have been frequent. Considering the current season, typhoons have long disappeared. This strong wind is likely a monsoon. Recently, near Shenjiamen in Dinghai, a fishing boat owned by a Zhou family fish merchant, carrying hairtail for sale in Shanghai, was struck by a monsoon on the morning of the 21st of this month while sailing in the waters of Dajiyan off the coast of Wusong. The boat immediately capsized. Fortunately, the three crew members were rescued by other passing ships. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday and went to the Dinghai Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, where the association arranged for them to purchase tickets to return to their hometown of Shenjiamen.</p>
<p>Special Shanghai Edition</p>
<h3>A Review and Prospect of China’s Accounting Scholarship and Accounting Profession (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Xulun</p>
<p>The above-mentioned systems for both official and banking bookkeeping were modeled after Japan. The work of the Railway Accounting Uniformity Committee was led by the American Mr. H.C. Adams. Therefore, Chinese railway accounting can be said to originate from the United States. Of these reforms, the one with the greatest impact on the Chinese accounting community was banking accounting. Government agencies and railways were relatively distant from the industrial and commercial sectors, while the banking sector had very close ties with the industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, the adoption of banking accounting systems by the industrial and commercial sectors was relatively easier. Even today, we still see many industrial and commercial organizations using the voucher and journal formats commonly used in banking, which is not without reason.</p>
<p>Regarding accounting education, to our knowledge, in addition to the aforementioned Beijing Bookkeeping Training Institute, the Nanjing Republic University of Law and Politics established a bookkeeping class in the first year of the Republic (1912), and I myself was a student in that class. In the third year of the Republic, a bookkeeping training institute was established in Beijing. Few public and private universities had commerce departments, and even fewer were known to offer bookkeeping and accounting classes. The publication of accounting translations was also extremely rare.</p>
<p>From the sixth or seventh year of the Republic to the sixteenth year of the Republic, China’s accounting scholarship and accounting profession gradually developed. During World War I, the powers were preoccupied with affairs in the West, and many new-style enterprises in China, such as cotton mills and flour mills, were established. The banking industry also became more developed. In the flourishing regions of the Southeast, public and private universities and specialized schools added commerce departments due to practical needs. Examples include the establishment of the Commerce Department at Nanjing Higher Normal School (1921), the establishment of Wuchang Higher Commercial School and Shanghai College of Commerce, the establishment of the Commerce Department at China Public School Fudan University, and the Shanghai Commercial Specialized School at the secondary school level. The number of bookkeeping and accounting translations also gradually increased from 1920, and there were many excellent works, such as Yang Duanliu’s "Commercial Bookkeeping and the Theory of Accounting Units," Wu Yingtu’s "Accounting and Auditing," and Xie Lin’s "Practical Banking Bookkeeping." The application of modern accounting gradually expanded from the government, banks, railways, and other sectors to industrial and commercial enterprises. Around 1921, the Commercial Press and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company had already adopted modern accounting. Many other enterprises also adopted it, but due to limited knowledge, we were unable to investigate and list them all.</p>
<p>The specialized profession of certified public accountant also gradually emerged. In 1918, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce of the former Northern Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Accountants, but domestic demand was not urgent, and the new system was not widely implemented. In 1921, the first accounting firm was established in Shanghai. Three years later, the Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants was initiated and established in March 1925 after a year of preparation. By 1927, the Shanghai Institute of Certified Public Accountants had 57 members, but less than one-third of them were actually engaged in practice.</p>
<p>In summary, from the end of the Qing Dynasty to 1927, China’s accounting scholarship was fragmented by warlordism. Although large-scale enterprises were established, they declined after World War I, and their management methods were not sound. Therefore, the application of modern accounting was still very narrow. It was not until the National Government unified the country that accounting scholarship and the accounting profession experienced vigorous development. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Sailboat "Sea Dragon" Prepares to Cross the Pacific</h3>
<p>Breaking the "Thirteen" Taboo: Expedition of 3,500 Miles</p>
<p>The British author, traveler, and adventurer, Mr. Halliburton, plans to sail with twelve comrades across the Pacific Ocean to the United States in the sailboat "Sea Dragon" in the near future. The boat will be displayed at the San Francisco World's Fair.</p>
<p>The Number Thirteen</p>
<p>is generally regarded as unlucky by Westerners, but Mr. Halliburton boldly breaks the superstition, gathering thirteen people to undertake this adventurous endeavor. It can be said that he is extremely brave and fearless. Currently, including Mr. Halliburton, twelve people have joined, with one spot remaining for the thirteenth. Mr. Halliburton intends to find a photographer to capture the journey along the way, but as the departure date is approaching, if one cannot be found, then anyone</p>
<p>can join</p>
<p>to reach the full number. Of the eleven already joined, one is Zhang Liangqu, a shipowner with rich navigation experience. The second is Bard, who owns a sixty-foot sailboat and therefore has extensive experience as well. The third is Duray, Bard's old comrade. The fourth is Feller, an engineer who will manage the</p>
<p>100-horsepower</p>
<p>diesel engine installed on the ship. The fifth is Davis, from Honolulu, who will serve as an assistant engineer. The sixth is Peterlee, a radio operator. The seventh is Monnet, a journalist who will assist Mr. Halliburton in writing articles to fund the trip. The eighth is Baston, a graduate of the New York Conservatory of Music, who will be responsible for music and</p>
<p>entertainment on board.</p>
<p>The ninth is Heins, also a college dropout traveler. The tenth is Kaile, only seventeen years old, the youngest of the group. The eleventh is Sly, an American cook with twenty years of experience, who will prepare meals for the entire crew. The Sea Dragon is 75 feet long and weighs 80 tons,</p>
<p>equipped with three sails</p>
<p>and a diesel engine. The sails are red, yellow, and white. Each side of the hull is painted with a dragon, and the stern is painted with a phoenix, making it extremely beautiful. The interior is lavishly decorated, and for security purposes, it is equipped with three small cannons, three rifles, and two pistols,</p>
<p>sufficient to defend against enemies.</p>
<p>It has been undergoing sea trials in recent days. Although the departure date has not been determined, it is expected to be within the month. The first stop will be Keelung in northern Taiwan to replenish food and fuel before preparing for the 3,500-mile journey to Midway Island. From Midway Island to Honolulu is 1,500 miles, and from Honolulu to San Francisco is about 2,500 miles.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit to Confirm Marriage: Focus on the Method of Union</h3>
<p>A couple separated due to criminal charges now contests the marital relationship</p>
<p>Xu Ke-min, the owner of a hardware store at 384 Weihaiwei Road, married Shen Yu-ying, a young woman from Changshu. Initially, their relationship was harmonious, and they lived together in his shop. However, their feelings soured last year, and their relationship deteriorated. Shen filed criminal charges against Xu, accusing him of rape, leading to their</p>
<p>separation.</p>
<p>Shen now resides at 100, Lane 51, Xinzha Bridge Road. She hired a lawyer and filed a civil lawsuit in the First Special District Court, seeking confirmation of their marital relationship. The court accepted the case and issued a summons, sending a bailiff to summon the defendant, Xu Ke-min, for questioning. However, people in the hardware store denied that Xu lived there. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo Run-hua held a hearing. The defendant,</p>
<p>unable to be summoned,</p>
<p>did not appear in court. The plaintiff, Shen Yu-ying, also did not attend, but was represented by her lawyer, who requested a postponement, stating that the plaintiff was ill. The lawyer also briefly recounted the past lawsuits between the two parties. The court then inquired about the initial method of their union. The lawyer stated that they had gone through marriage formalities, but the marriage certificate and other documents were taken away by the defendant when they lived together, so the plaintiff is now requesting confirmation of their marital relationship. Judge Mo then ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur of Yuan Shikai's Sixth Son Sentenced for Selling Car and Defrauding</h3>
<p>Xu A-lin, from Haimen, a driver for the sixth son of the late President Yuan Shikai, falsely claimed to Hu Ming-chu, a driver for Tian Baixiang, a Cantonese employee of the Renji Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road, that his master's car was for sale. Hu, knowing that his employer was planning to buy a car, informed Tian Baixiang. After negotiating with Xu, they agreed on a price of 3,500 yuan in legal tender. They handed the money to Xu, who then refused to acknowledge the transaction. Tian reported this to the police, who sent detectives to arrest Xu, as well as Cao Cai-lin, who was hiding the money for Xu, and Zhao Mao-lin, who lived with Cao and introduced Xu to a lawyer. All the funds were recovered and sent to the First Special District Court. After investigation, they awaited sentencing, as previously reported. Yesterday was the date for the verdict. The police escorted Xu and the other two to the court, where Judge Dai announced the sentence. Xu A-lin was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Zhao Mao-lin was acquitted. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu immediately declared that he would appeal the Zhao Mao-lin part of the case and requested that Zhao remain in custody pending consideration during the statutory appeal period. The court then ordered Zhao Mao-lin to remain in custody during the appeal period.</p>

<h3>Puppet "City Government" Gang is Impoverished, Resulting in Double Salary Uproar</h3>
<p>False Treasury Empty, Rumors Spread of Xiao-an Breaking Promises, Su Xiwu Exploits Opportunity to Stir Up Trouble and Incite Uproar</p>
<p>The puppet "City Government" has recently been embroiled in a dispute over demanding double salaries for the abolished Lunar New Year. As the puppet officials collectively made this request last month, the puppet "Secretary-General" Su Xiwu also joined in stirring up trouble, expressing his support. The puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiao-an was initially reluctant to refuse and promised to consider it. He even discussed and decided on a preliminary plan: generally, the lower-ranking puppet "officials" with smaller salaries would receive an additional two months' salary, for a total of three months including their original salary. The other puppet officials who had served for more than six months would receive an additional month's salary, for a total of two months including their original salary. Those who had served for less than six months would receive an additional half-month's salary, for a total of one and a half months including their original salary. However, many days have passed, and nothing has been done. The puppet officials have heard rumors that the puppet "Mayor" is using the pretext of an empty puppet "treasury" to cancel the previous agreement, so they are pressing Fu to bring up the matter again, determined not to give up until their goal is achieved. It is said that this undercurrent was stirred up by Su Xiwu to retaliate against the Fu faction for excluding members of the Su faction.</p>
<h3>Suicide Due to Unemployment</h3>
<p>Judge Examines Corpse, Family Members Sign Agreement to Claim Body</p>
<p>Jin Fu-qing, a 31-year-old from Ningbo, was lodging with his older sister at 4 Tongchang Lane, North Jiangxi Road, Haining Road. Recently, he suffered from unemployment and economic pressure. On the 18th of this month, he went out. That night, he went to the Yuandan Hotel at 491 Edward VII Road (west end of the Great World amusement center) in the French Concession and checked into room 55. He stayed there until the night of the 21st when he suddenly had a moment of despair and secretly drank poison to commit suicide. It was not until 1:00 PM on the 2nd that the tea boy, Qu Jinyuan, urged him to get up but received no response. He forced open the door and found Jin's face pale and his mind confused. He could not speak. He immediately reported it to the French police, who sent him to Renji Hospital. He had been poisoned too severely to be saved and died at 1:00 AM yesterday. The French police took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination and sent detectives to find his family. Yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren of the Special Court No. 2 and a forensic doctor arrived at the scene at noon to examine the body. They determined that Jin Fu-qing had indeed died from drinking poison. His brother-in-law, surnamed Chen, arrived, signed an agreement, and claimed the body.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Number 9 Crushes a Woman from the Countryside to Death</h3>
<p>A woman surnamed Wang, about 40 years old, from 12 Kongjia Stone Bridge, Pudong, crossed the river from Pudong to Shanghai with her neighbor Chen Liugen yesterday morning. At 10:40 AM, while walking across the road at 139 Avenue Edward VII (corner of Rue du Moulin in the French Concession), from north to south, as Ms. Wang was walking on the south side of the road, a No. 9 public bus, number 15144, of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, driven by driver Yu Zixi (27 years old, from Shandong), was coming from east to west. Ms. Wang was unable to avoid it and was knocked down by the right fender of the bus. The wheel ran over her chest, killing her instantly. The police arrived, recorded the number, and reported it to the McTaggart police station. They sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination, pending notification of her family. A request was made to the court today to send personnel to inspect the scene. The transportation company also sent personnel to take photos and measurements at the scene for future investigation.</p>

<h3>The French Concession Police Cracked Down on Seven Gambling Dens Within Half a Day</h3>
<p>Numerous Male and Female Offenders Arrested and Sent to Court</p>
<p>Not long after his release from prison, Mao Axiang, a key figure in gambling syndicates, recently exploited the unique environment of Caojiadu to establish a large gambling den. He dispatched his accomplices to set up gambling networks throughout the Special District. Gambling devices such as "listening tubes" and "shipping boats" were everywhere. Countless citizens were victimized, and many have even resorted to murder after losing heavily in gambling. Consequently, the concession authorities instructed the police to crack down severely on gambling. On the day before yesterday, between noon and 6:00 PM, Chinese detectives Liu Kunbao, Wang Wenwei, Zhang Huaiqi, Chen Tinghuai, and Zhang Jianyun from the French Concession Police, within half a day, successively raided seven gambling dens using "listening tubes" and "shipping boat" devices: (1) No. 8, Alley 222, Avenue Albert; the "listening tube" boss, Zhu Chengde, a native of Yangzhou, and his accomplice, Shuai Shunyou, a native of Taizhou, were arrested. (2) No. 27, Rue du Père Robert, Baixiang Village; the "shipping boat" boss, Wang Shisheng, a native of Wuxi, and gamblers Cai Yongfu and Madame Ma Yuan, were arrested. (3) No. 26, Baixiang Village; the "shipping boat" boss, Chen Zhiliang, a native of Ningbo, was arrested. (4) Alley off No. 16, Rue du Père Robert; the "shipping boat" boss, Zhang Yuxiang, a native of Jiangbei, was arrested. (5) No. 32, Zhicheng Fang, Rue Galle; the "shipping boat" boss, Ji Yutang, a local, was arrested. (6) Intersection of Route Wagner and Route de Montauban; the "shipping boat" boss, Zhang Yuming, a native of Danyang, was arrested. (7) No. 6, Xinglong Street, Xujiahui Road; the "listening tube" boss, Gao Chunsheng, a native of Jiangbei, and gamblers Liu Shifu and Zhang Yousheng, were arrested. A large amount of gambling slips and cash from the seven gambling dens were confiscated and taken to the police station. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for prosecution. Judge Zhu Chuzhe presided over the hearing. All the defendants pleaded guilty. Judge Zhu addressed the defendants, stating, "Currently, some unscrupulous individuals are exploiting the unique environment to open large gambling dens outside the concessions, endangering society. You are not afraid of facing lawsuits and are actually acting as accomplices to those evil individuals, which is extremely reprehensible." Judge Zhu announced that after a debate, Ji Yutang, Zhang Yuxiang, Wang Shisheng, and Chen Zhiliang were sentenced to four months of imprisonment for intending to profit from and engaging in public gambling. If they choose to pay a fine instead, it would be calculated at three yuan per day. Gao Chunsheng and Zhang Yuming were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment. Liu Shifu, Zhang Yousheng, Cai Yongfu, and Madame Ma Yuan were each fined four yuan. As for Zhu Chengde and Shuai Shunyou, the two offenders were remanded in custody and their hearing was postponed to January 30th.</p>

<h3>New Trends in Enslavement Education by the Puppet Organization in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Plotting to Seize Private School Property, Paying Attention to Students' Hat Badges</p>
<p>(Suzhou Dispatch) Since Pan Zhenxiao resigned from his concurrent position as the head of the puppet "Jiangsu Education Department," Qin Mianjun, a native of Wuxi, has succeeded him. Since Qin took office in the middle of the semester, all measures have followed the old regulations, with very few innovations. Now that this semester has come to an end and the second semester is about to begin, he has specifically formulated the following methods to actively promote enslavement education. Here are a few of the key points to observe the new trends in enslavement education.</p>
<p>The Puppet Jiangsu Provincial Government governs Wu County, Wuxi, Wujin, and other counties, which were originally areas with developed private schools. Last summer, Dongwu University and its affiliated middle school, Taowu, Yancheng, Cuiying, Huiling, Zhensheng, Shude, and Leyi in Wu County, Sixi Middle School and Jingzhi Girls' Middle School in Wuxi, and Changzhong Middle School in Wujin all moved to Shanghai and resumed classes one after another. Therefore, the Japanese Special Service Department was very displeased and sent people to visit the head of the puppet "Jiangsu Education Department" to express that the "friendship" between the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles could not be fully realized and that measures should be taken to stop it. After thinking it over again and again, Qin came up with an idea and formulated six articles of the puppet "Methods for Private Primary and Secondary Schools in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province to Apply for Resumption of Classes at the Original Site": "(1) Private primary and secondary schools registered in various counties of this province before the war should all open classes at the original site. (2) Private primary and secondary schools in various counties should apply to the county government for resumption of classes. (3) Private primary and secondary schools in various counties should submit two copies of the resumption of classes application form. (4) Private primary and secondary schools in various counties that do not open classes locally should be ordered to move back to the original site to apply for resumption of classes. (5) If private primary and secondary schools in various counties delay applying for resumption of classes, or have applied for resumption of classes but do not open classes, or do not open classes locally and do not comply with the order to move back to the original site, their school property and equipment should be investigated and kept in custody by the county government and allocated to other schools for use after being submitted to the Education Department for approval. (6) The deadline for private primary and secondary schools in various counties to apply for resumption of classes is stipulated from December 1938 to the end of March 1939. After the county governments have completed the application for resumption of classes, they should report to the Education Department for verification within one week." Judging from its intention to preserve the school property and equipment of private schools, they are bound to move back to the original site to attend classes. However, all private middle schools moved to Shanghai to attend classes, relying solely on their spirit to gain social sympathy. The school property and equipment of the past were originally not worth cherishing. The puppet organization's conspiracy only reveals its futile efforts. Since the incident in each county, string music has ceased, and many tutorial academies have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. In addition, private middle schools have also been established intermittently. All of these institutions have registered with the puppet "Education Department." Now, the puppet organization has issued orders to all counties that the recruitment of students by private tutorial academies and middle schools should be marked with the words "Approved for Establishment by the Puppet Jiangsu Education Department" or "Registered with the Puppet Jiangsu Education Department upon Verification." The puppet organization's means of educational control can be seen from this. In order to please the Japanese side, the puppet "Suzhou Education Department" pays special attention to students' hat badges. All those with anti-Japanese and national salvation words must be discarded and not used again. Recently, a special notice was issued to all counties ordering them to strictly investigate and not be negligent. Obsequiousness and servility are meticulous in order to please the Japanese, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Yangzhou Middle School's Schools in Taizhou and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou Middle School is one of the best middle schools in the country and enjoys a long-standing reputation. In November 1937, when Yangzhou fell into the war zone, the school suspended classes and disbanded. Some of the teachers and students fled to Shanghai, and most retreated to various counties north of the Yangtze River. Parents of students and people from all walks of life felt it was a pity that such an excellent middle school could not hold classes, so they requested and assisted the school to resume classes. Principal Zhou Houzhu consulted with the teachers and staff by letter and telegram and established two schools in Shanghai and Taixian. Zhou entrusted Huang Tai to act as the principal of the Shanghai school of Yangzhou Middle School, and Ji Naiquan to act as the principal of the Taixian school of Yangzhou Middle School. Both schools have now resumed classes for more than one semester, each with more than 500 students in eleven grades. The teachers are all excellent teachers from Yangzhou Middle School. All aspects of administration, teaching, and discipline management are based on Zhou's spirit of rigorousness and diligence in running Yangzhou Middle School for more than ten years, so the school spirit is very disciplined and valued by all parties.</p>

<h3>Heroic Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Zhi Xibai</p>
<p>— In Memory of My Late Friend, Lu Jixian, on the Anniversary of His Death</p>
<p>A swarm of airplanes hovered in the sky above the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, "Pa pa..." bursts of machine-gun fire, "Boom boom boom..." the explosions of bombs shook the houses, rivers, and trees of Zhaoxiang: windowpanes rattled, ripples spread across the water, and withered leaves fluttered.</p>
<p>Boats in the river passed one after another, each boatman using double the strength, his face tense, showing extreme panic.</p>
<p>"The army has reached Sheshan!" Someone ran breathlessly into Fuxing Garden, reporting the alarming news to the crowd. All the tea drinkers in the garden trembled, their faces turning pale.</p>
<p>"Let's go! Are we staying to die?" The crowd scattered, and a violent commotion broke out in Zhaoxiang Town. Men, women, old, and young all rushed home.</p>
<p>"But where can we go? We won't be able to live." The same serious question emerged in everyone's mind.</p>
<p>Lu's house was filled with frightened people.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Lu was the guiding light of Zhaoxiang. He could point out the path that the people of Zhaoxiang should take, no matter the time.</p>
<p>"The time has come when we must leave. The able-bodied men should gather their weapons and put the elderly, women, and children on the boats to leave first. We young people will take care of things from behind. We can only survive by going around Qingpu." Mr. Lu said sternly and directly to the crowd, explaining why they had to do so.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, everything was prepared. More than a dozen large boats were filled with men, women, old, and young, as well as simple luggage and a small amount of food. The weapons of Zhaoxiang Town were placed on one of the boats in the middle, guarded by six strong men. Each boat was covered with a grass shed to prevent enemy bombing.</p>
<p>The boats set sail. More than a dozen boats connected into a long snake. Mr. Lu's family was at the end, because Mr. Lu was prepared to deal with any incident, allowing the remaining boats to pass unhindered.</p>
<p>The boats slowly moved westward, the silhouette of Zhaoxiang gradually disappearing from the view of the people of Zhaoxiang.</p>
<p>When the boats reached outside the east gate of Qingpu, only two or three li away from the Song-Qing Road, a gunshot suddenly rang out from behind, followed by the sound of "docking the boat," like the roar of a beast.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu waved his hand, signaling the boats in front to keep moving forward, that he would withstand everything, and that he would never forget the weapons on the boat for the people of Zhaoxiang.</p>
<p>"Dock the boat!" Another roar, and Mr. Lu's boat had to land.</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"..." Mr. Lu did not answer. He did not understand what the other party was.</p>
<p>"I'm asking you, who are you?"</p>
<p>"I am Chinese!" When Mr. Lu clearly saw that the person asking the question was Chinese and that the steel helmet was inlaid with a circular red badge, he said straightforwardly. He understood that surrender was shameful, and that it was better to die with honor than to live in disgrace. Fortunately, the crowd had accelerated their advance, and at most, only his family would be sacrificed.</p>
<p>"Damn it, who doesn't know you're Chinese! Who are you?"</p>
<p>"I am Lu Jixian!"</p>
<p>"What do you do?"</p>
<p>"I am Chinese, born in modern China, doing what China needs to be done."</p>
<p>"Arrest him!" The other party was ashamed and angry.</p>
<p>"No need to arrest me, I'll get up myself!" Mr. Lu climbed ashore.</p>
<p>"..." The other party had no words.</p>
<p>"Who are you? Aren't you Chinese? What are you doing? If 500 million Chinese people all worked for their own country, how could the barbarians behind you have broken into this place?" Mr. Lu questioned them fiercely, as if giving a speech to the crowd.</p>
<p>A group of barbarian beasts widened their eyes and mumbled urgently for a while, then waved their hands, indicating that they were impatient and should start.</p>
<p>The questioner raised a shiny bayonet, but Mr. Lu calmly stretched out his neck, ready to be dealt with.</p>
<p>"Speak! Are there any troops ahead?" "Yes! A lot of them, they've been waiting for you for a long time. They're going to welcome you with machine guns and hand grenades!"</p>
<p>"Are you not telling the truth?"</p>
<p>"I am telling the truth! Do you think I'm the same as you? You really insult me."</p>
<p>With a "whoosh!" the shiny bayonet slashed across Mr. Lu's face, and then Mr. Lu's glasses slipped from the bridge of his nose to the ground, and bright red blood dripped from Mr. Lu's left cheek.</p>
<p>With a "shick!" the bayonet flashed again, and blood also flowed from Mr. Lu's right cheek.</p>
<p>"Do you recognize this guy?"</p>
<p>"Recognize him! Not long after, this guy will fall into the hands of our army and become a driving force for national rejuvenation!" Saying that, Mr. Lu raised his eyebrows. He felt his cheeks were a little hot.</p>
<p>"Bang!" Mr. Lu fell to the ground in response, his feet stretching and contracting non-stop, but his eyes were wide open, shouting "Long live the Republic of China! Down with ×× Imperialism! Kill all traitors!..."</p>
<p>"Bang!" Another sound, and Mr. Lu was silent.</p>
<p>The water of Sanliu River was flowing silently, shedding tears; Jiuxue lowered its head to show sorrow. On the ground, the broken lenses of the glasses were flashing brightly, symbolizing the final glory.</p>
<h3>Good News Comes With Each Year, The Military Camp Seems New With Each Passing Season</h3>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<h3>"Inspiration"</h3>
<p>— Qiu Zhen</p>
<p>The Soviet writer M. Zoshchenko, in his "How I Write," says:</p>
<p>"...I have two methods of working. One method is: whenever I have inspiration, I write with creative impulse. At this time, the work progresses lightly and without flaws. The entire picture, the entire structure of things, is naturally formed.</p>
<p>"The second method is when there is no inspiration. When I encounter such a situation, I write with technical training. In this method of working, I do what is usually done by the subconscious: I build the plan of the theme myself, I properly dispose of each paragraph and each word, and develop the story from the word..."</p>
<p>However, he later further said, "It (inspiration) is the only essential element for a writer, for all the work of a writer. Technique can certainly help inspiration, supplement the lack of inspiration; it can also replace inspiration—with technique, one can eventually avoid lowering one's own quality; however, if there is never any kind of inspiration, that writer will certainly not be able to achieve profound progress."</p>
<p>The reason why "inspiration" is an indispensable element in literary writing is not only for the convenience of writing—generally speaking, writing with the impulse of inspiration is indeed lighter and more satisfactory; but also because literature and art must contain moving emotions in the expression of images. It borrows the image, passes through sensibility, and then turns into recognition. The creation written by the writer's recognition accompanied by emotion can give the reader "resonance" and produce the effect of literature and art. If there is no real emotion, then no matter how correct the writer's worldview is, how skilled the technique is, what he writes is at most a description of principles, a depiction of images, it is always dead, and has no infectiousness. The so-called "formulaism" and the so-called "eight-legged essay," in addition to the problems of technique, the author's lack of inspiration is also a major reason.</p>
<p>Then what is "inspiration"? Zoshchenko believes that "inspiration is a happy combination of physical health, mental strength, lively nerves and firm self-confidence, a combination that throws all one's abilities into one place—in one occasion—in literature."</p>
<p>This explanation is not very clear. I think that "inspiration" is the combination of cognition and emotion, that is, the impulse of consciousness. It is by no means the ethereal holy spirit falling from the sky that is generally misunderstood, but a spiritual state produced in the practice of life and in contact with things. Therefore, inspiration is also a product of reality. Without reality, it is hollow and hypocritical.</p>
<p>From this point of view, writers don't have to worry about not having inspiration. As long as you go to contact reality, to experience life, to go deep into the society you want to describe to practice, to understand, then, followed by your correct worldview or cognition, there will surely be many different situations of righteousness. To pursue and grasp inspiration in this way and write, can you write truthfully, infectiously, and resonate with the entire readership.</p>
<p>It is ultimately coercive to write only with knowledge and themes without digesting them, because although this is not necessarily a game of words, it still fails to achieve the reality of literature and art. Writers should return the cognition to the phenomenon, return the themes to reality—that is, to practice life, so that cognition and themes are tempered and melted by the emotions from which they arise, and embodied as the true inspiration before writing, this is good.</p>
<p>Of course, if a person already has such inspiration, it will be easier to succeed in writing. I hope they can write boldly and more.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Biographies of the Righteous People of Jiangyin</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——National Novels</p>
<p>Yang Fei has already introduced the thoughts in this book "Unofficial Biographies of the Righteous People of Jiangyin" (written by Hu Shanyuan, a total of sixteen short stories, published by World Book Company, four corners) in the eighth issue of "Black Tea". Now I want to try to explore the techniques or artistry of this book.</p>
<p>The materials on which the author is based are all included in the appendix, which allows us to compare and see clearly the hard work the author has put in. The simpler seems to be using Ming Zhu Chunyu's "Jiangyin Hou Lu" and Qing Ji Liuqi's "Huang Yuqi's Uprising in Zhutang" to write "Huang Yuqi", using "Tianxiang Pavilion Random Notes" to write "Hu Zhixue", "Xu Wu" and "Li Jieli", and using "Yuchu New Records" to write "Qi Sanlang". More effort was spent writing "Xu Yong", "The Ji Brothers", "Cheng Bi", "Wang Hua", "Old Man Tang San", "Chen Xianqin" and "Xu Yuyang" from Qing Han Tan's "Records of Jiangyin City Defense", Qing Xu Chongxi's "Post-Records of Jiangyin City Defense" and Qing Shen Tao's "Jiangshang Relics" and other articles, with the main focus as follows: June 1st and 2nd (Xu Yong and the Ji brothers), 15th (Cheng Bi), July 12th and 29th (Old Man Tang San), 20th to 27th (Xu Yuyang), August 2nd (Wang Hua), 8th (Chen Xianqin). However, "Old Man Tang San" and "Tang Surname Boy" are not necessarily father and son. Twisting them together is more interesting. This is a bold and clever place for the author, because novels are ultimately not trustworthy history and do not need to be weighed so carefully. Although the Wugeng Tune, Persuasion Song and Answer Song added in the "Xu Yong" article are drafted by the author, they are much more interesting than a single sentence.</p>
<p>The most complex and large are the three articles "Huang Mingjiang", "The He Brothers" and "Chen Erlang". The name Huang Mingjiang comes from legend, so everyone says different things. "Records of Jiangyin City Defense" and "Jiangshang Relics" write Huang Mingjiang, "Post-Records" and "Lu Qiao Records" write Huang Yunjiang, and "Tianxiang Pavilion Random Notes" write Wang Yungang, with three completely different characters. The author considered the time between them, weaved these five types of text together, and also made interesting couplet-style dialogues, which took a lot of painstaking effort. The He brothers are He Chang and He Tai. The author cleverly pulled the "two brothers" from "The Southern History of the Late Ming Dynasty" and put them on the heads of the He brothers. Although "Chen Erlang" is from "A Grand View of Anecdotes from the Ming and Qing Dynasties", many anecdotes after the city was destroyed are cleverly organized together. The opening quote of a section about people hiding in the Buddha hall in "The Oral Account of a Refugee", and the middle section inserts two tragic facts (female corpse shadows and naked women with arrows, both seen in Tianxiang Pavilion Random Notes) through Chen Erlang's play, even if they are seen through Chen Erlang's eyes, also took a lot of thought.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, I think the following articles should be the highlight of the entire book, namely: "Old Man Tang San", "Chen Xianqin", "The He Brothers" and "Chen Erlang". On the one hand, the story itself is the most stimulating, and on the other hand, it is due to the author's skillful technique. "Old Man Tang San" is written as hot as fire, as interesting as reading Water Margin or Three Kingdoms. In the "Chen Yiqin" section, the author deliberately plays tricks. Although he does not explicitly state who the underwater assassin is, the reader already knows that this is Chen Xianqin. Moreover, according to unofficial history, this assassin is not necessarily Chen Xianqin. The author's vague writing just does not contradict unofficial history. "The He Brothers" almost entirely use the analogy of the Qianzhuang dialect to compare fighting against the Qing soldiers. The language is wonderful and it is indeed a rare good article. The nine-year-old "Chen Erlang" is written very cutely, just like a child's actions and tone, and Arida's ignorance of the joy between people is also portrayed in detail.</p>
<p>What is regrettable is "Yan Dian Shi". This supporter of the Jiangyin City Guard does not have a novel. Although he is Chu Dian Shi, he is also a "righteous person" of Jiangyin. He cannot be stripped of his qualifications as a commoner because he became an official; moreover, he had already retired and only became a Dian Shi because he was supported by the people. Also, there are no female resistance fighters; for example, Huang Yuqi's wife's repeated suicide attempts are good material. But this is inevitable nitpicking.</p>
<p>(Note) Huang Yuqi's daughter-in-law repeatedly tried to commit suicide. Her suicide seems to have been to die for her husband, not to resist the Manchus. The author did not write about her, perhaps because of this.</p>

<h3>Mother's Joy</h3>
<p>— Zhe Hen</p>
<p>——Presented to my brother who is far away on the battlefield</p>
<p>When you are on the battlefield, with the moonlight and winds fading and the wilderness everywhere, and you miss your mother and want to return home, please remember this sentence: "Without national freedom, there is no mother."</p>
<p>Mother's tears are an expression of her love, pity, and concern for you, but don't be saddened by this, because mother's tears are the needle of happiness. If we are suppressed under the enemy's iron hooves, there will be days when we want to cry but have no tears.</p>
<p>The wrinkles on mother's face are deepening day by day, mother's body is as thin as a reed, and mother's cheeks are becoming drier day by day... If you remember these things, then you should be motivated, pick up your gun, fix your bayonet, and kill all the enemies. Bring back a little blood for your mother to drink heartily, and fatten up the reed-like mother.</p>
<p>Now it's cold, and mother always likes to bathe in the stream of daylight, to get a little warmth. If the days become overcast, then you should raise your clenched fist and tear open the smoky cloud curtain, let the blue sky and the white sun shine red on the earth.</p>
<p>Your youth, your happiness, your joy, your wisdom, your future, your light, your ambition... and everything you have! Don't lose it in your mother's tears.</p>
<p>In her spare time, mother often talks about the story of Yue Fei. How she admires Yue Wumu's loyalty and bravery! If you want to win your mother's joy, then you should prepare your banners and drums, and on the open-air stage under the spark of freedom, go and perform the story of Yue Fei!</p>
<p>On the day when the national people celebrate the victory of the all-out war of resistance, you, wearing the crown of freedom and glory, return. When you walk to the loving arms of your mother, who is standing on the dock and looking forward to her beloved son's triumphant return, you should smile and say, "Mother! Your beloved son has returned with freedom."</p>
<h3>It's Best If You Don't Think</h3>
<p>— Lu Gong</p>
<p>It's best if you don't think,</p>
<p>Of that beautiful hometown,</p>
<p>It has now been destroyed,</p>
<p>And turned into a graveyard.</p>
<p>The fields have long been uncultivated,</p>
<p>The sickle in the tiles is full of yellow flowers,</p>
<p>That old house of more than ten years,</p>
<p>Only a few pillars remain, leaning east and west.</p>
<p>Having been exiled for thousands of miles to this day,</p>
<p>You can forget your small hometown,</p>
<p>Move forward, I advise you,</p>
<p>There is a new world ahead.</p>

<h3>Finance: Japanese Banks Suddenly Aggressively Settle Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Sassoon Has Supply, Once Loosened, Then Reported Softening</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were many settlements by British and American foreign firms in the foreign exchange market, along with aggressive absorption by Japanese banks, which led to a tightening of the situation. Although Hong Kong Telecom and Sassoon provided mutual supply in the middle, tending to loosen, they ultimately could not hold for long due to insufficient supply to meet demand. There were slight fluctuations throughout the day, and the volume of transactions was quite active.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large bar was close to a further reduction, the New York silver price did not move, and there was no change in the London gold. The exchange rate was 3.7% against the US dollar, 10 French centimes against the French franc, and 1.25 against Shanghai. The US dollar rose 25 against the British pound, fell 1.25 against the French franc, and was one dime larger against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. At the bank's early opening, the spot selling price was 8 pence 421875 for British exchange and 16.40625 yuan for US exchange, compared to the previous close, British exchange was flat and US exchange was 0.03125 yuan higher. After opening, British American Tobacco Company settled spot US exchange through Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and Citibank, initially at 16.4375 yuan, then only at 375. In addition, foreign firms also absorbed spot British exchange from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Banque de l'Indochine at 8 pence 421875, then gradually softened to 8 pence 406825. There was no change in the announcement of the HSBC listing and the silver equalization tax. After that, foreign telegrams indicated that Hong Kong and Sassoon successively sold spot British exchange to American banks Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and Banque de l'Indochine at 8 pence 4375 and US dollars at 16.4375 yuan. In addition, money changers also sold spot Hong Kong exchange to the Dutch banks Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij and Banca d'Italia at 57 yuan and 56.875 yuan. Therefore, the situation turned hard. The afternoon closing price was 8 pence 421875 for British exchange and 16.40625 yuan for US exchange.</p>
<p>In the after-market, the situation remained loose at first because the selling intentions of Hong Kong Telecom and Sassoon were not weak. They also sold spot British exchange to HSBC at 8 pence 4375 and US dollars to the Dutch bank Maclaine Watson at 16.4375 yuan. Afterwards, a certain bank suddenly bought spot US exchange from Chinese banks at only 16.375 yuan. In addition, Japanese banks also began to settle through Banque Belge pour l'Etranger at 16.375 yuan, and also bought spot British exchange from Banca d'Italia and Banque de l'Indochine at only 8 pence 390625. Furthermore, Banca d'Italia and the Dutch bank absorbed Hong Kong exchange from money changers at 16.875 yuan. Therefore, the underlying trend tightened. The evening closing selling price at banks was 8 pence 40625 for British exchange and 16.375 yuan for US exchange, resulting in British exchange softening by 0.015625 and US exchange being unchanged compared to the previous close, and Hong Kong exchange loosening slightly by 0.125.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Set</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for foreign exchange draft bills stopped falling and leveled off, fluctuating around 35 yuan per thousand packages throughout the day. The final price was 35.25 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price.</p>
<h3>Large Bar Near Distant Reduction</h3>
<p>London telegram on the 23rd: Speculators sold a small amount, and the market stabilized. The market continued to be calm after closing. The near-term of the large silver bar remained unchanged, and the distant-term was reduced by 0.0625. New York silver telegram: the US silver price remained unchanged with no market. Bombay silver telegram: The Indian silver market was calm, and there were no changes in spot and near- and far-term futures.</p>
<h3>Most Foreign Currencies Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold was unchanged, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 25. Foreign exchange settlements were very active, and foreign telegram supply was eager. Supply and demand were still balanced, and the market price hovered with a slight softening trend. Local merchants still sold more, but Hong Kong merchants were sluggish in absorbing. The market price fluctuated very narrowly, with a slightly soft trend. There were few transactions in the association. Zhenmao sold 50 British gold pounds to Yongtai, Huitong sold 50 British gold pounds to Yongtai, and Qintai sold 500 US dollar bills to Tongfeng. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pound rose by 1 dime, British gold bill rose by 2 cents, US dollar pound rose by 1 dime, US dollar bill rose by 1.5 cents, French franc bill rose by 1 li, Singapore dollar bill rose by 1 cent, Canadian dollar bill rose by 4 cents, Philippine dollar bill rose by 1 cent, and other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Major Investors Watch, Gold Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Fixed at 2009 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cash raw gold after-hours market conditions suddenly turned into a dull stalemate, with no excitement at all, lingering at 2,009 yuan all day long. Generally, major investors were mostly on the sidelines, aiming to observe the changes in the European situation. Although Hong Kong merchants secretly continued to collect in the middle, the number was limited, only about a hundred taels. Moreover, the local silver shops and money exchange businesses successively dumped and sold a considerable amount, causing the market price to eventually fall by three yuan. Everyone's mood was calm, and there were very few transactions. Silver shop jewelry gold did not change, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold also remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar of ten taels opened initially because it was heard that foreign exchange opened, and Hong Kong telegraph and Western merchants vigorously dumped, tending to loosen. The price was then called down from 2012 yuan to 09 yuan, before transactions were seen. First, a money exchange business made 50 taels, with a price of 2009 yuan as the opening price. Then, a certain silver shop (on behalf of Hong Kong merchants) advanced 50 taels each from money exchange businesses and colleagues, at the same price. Later, a gold firm advanced 50 taels from silver shops, also at 09 yuan. After that, the potential of foreign exchange was quite stable, causing the market to suddenly turn stagnant. Transactions were still not seen until noon. Therefore, the noon closing price was the same as the morning opening. It was heard that after closing, a certain money exchange business sold 50 taels to a colleague, also at 09 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation became even more dull. At first, only money exchange businesses mutually made 50 taels, still at 09 yuan. Later, because it was heard that foreign exchange was being vigorously pulled back by Japanese banks and weakened, sellers mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Transactions were still not seen until after 4 o'clock, so the evening closing price was still 2009 yuan, a decrease of three yuan compared to the previous day. The selling price of spot gold from cash firms was 2020 yuan, and the buying price was 2005 yuan. The current premium gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Silver shop jewelry gold, per tael for exchange, did not change due to the fixed price of raw gold. Da Tong Hang and Lao Qing Yun and others still hung the original price of 204 yuan, while Xin Tong Hang hung 202 yuan, and the buying price was 196 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Has Stopped Rising and is Trending Flat</p>
<p>London, 23rd - London pure gold per ounce did not change because people's hearts had turned stable due to the British pound returning to growth. The calculation is still £7, 8 shillings, 8 and a half pence. Therefore, the listed price of the central bank also remained unchanged. The buying price of Chinese pure gold (raw gold) is also still 1213 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed price of customs gold is still calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 9 li. The Shanghai standard premium gold price is also still hanging at 1209 yuan, 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Securities London Foreign Debt Has a Quote But No Market</h3>
<p>But Prices are Continuing to Rise, Domestic Debt is Still Shrouded in Selling Pressure</p>
<p>The listed market price of London Chinese foreign debt on the 23rd of this month (Monday) has again entered a state of stagnation with quotes but no market. Various bonds have generally risen by one or two pounds. The Anglo-German renewed loan, Anglo-French bond coupons, and Crisp loan have each risen by one pound. The former is priced at 73 pounds, and the latter is priced at 34 pounds. The Vickers aircraft bond coupons have shrunk back by half a pound, priced at 12 and a half pounds. Railway bonds, such as Daokow-Singiang Railway, Hukuang Railway, and Shanghai-Nanking Railway, have each risen by two pounds. The Daokow-Singiang Railway bond is priced at 23 pounds. The non-German-issued Hukuang Railway bond coupon is priced at 22 pounds, and the German-issued bond coupon is priced at 20 pounds. The Shanghai-Nanking Railway bond is also 22 pounds. The Kowloon-Canton Railway bond has risen by one and a half pounds, priced at 18 and a half pounds. The original and renewed bond coupons of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway have each risen by one pound, and the market price is 16 pounds. The supply and demand of spot goods in London are still quite lively. It is heard that 10,000 pounds of Anglo-French bond coupons of the British Gold Rehabilitation Loan are being sold, and the selling side is very firm and demanding a tight price. There are also German-issued bond coupons being sold at a selling price of 45 pounds and 15 shillings, slightly lower than last week by five shillings. At the same time, the buying side is also interested in 2,500 pounds, offering only 43 pounds and 2 and a half shillings. It seems difficult for both sides to agree. There is also 1,500 pounds (i.e., 7,500 US dollars) of the French-American 5% bond coupon, higher by half a pound. As for railway bonds, the supply and demand are also quite strong. 2,000 pounds of the non-German-issued Hukuang Railway bond coupon have been sold at a selling price of 23 and a half pounds, raising the price by one and a half pounds according to the market. However, 2,500 pounds of the drawn bond coupon of the said bond are being sought, offering 23 pounds, raising the price by one pound according to the market. 2,000 pounds of the German-issued undrawn bond coupon of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway renewed loan have been sold at a selling price of 17 pounds, raising the price by one pound according to the market. 1,000 pounds of the Daokow-Singiang Railway bond have been sold at a selling price of 25 pounds, raising the price by two pounds according to the market. 5,000 pounds of the Kowloon-Canton Railway bond have been sold at a selling price of 19 pounds, raising the price by half a pound according to the market. It is heard that the old price of the Kowloon-Canton Railway bond market is 16 and a half pounds, and the old price of the Vickers aircraft bond coupon market is 13 pounds and 15 shillings.</p>
<p>The listed market price of London British Far East companies' stocks on the 23rd of this month (Monday) has changed very little. The shares of the Mercantile Bank of India and China have fallen by two and a half shillings, priced at 8 pounds and 17 and a half shillings. The bearer shares of the Kailan Mining Administration have continued to fall by six pence, priced at 16 shillings and three pence.</p>
<p>The after-hours market for securities yesterday gradually developed a downward trend from weakness. The previous sharp decline failed to see a rebound after the announcement of the measures, which is enough to show the lack of enthusiasm. After several fluctuations, it gradually declined. It should not have this phenomenon as the interest payment period approaches. It is only because the general public is somewhat dissatisfied with this new measure, and merchants, who only seek profit, have started selling off in droves. But this will ultimately be a temporary phenomenon, and the future of the entire public debt is still optimistic. The market price was stable at the beginning of yesterday's session, but then scattered bulls and Xie Da Company successively came out or sought to sell, causing the market price to be unstable and repeatedly decline. Trading was light in the afternoon. No. 10 sold Class A, B, and C, and No. 11 sold small amounts. Throughout the day, although trading was not very active, the trend was completely shrouded in selling pressure, with high pressure all around, and it was not easy to recover for a while. As a result, market prices uniformly declined, ranging from one and a half jiao to eight and a half jiao. The total number of transactions was estimated to be more than 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading is still not enthusiastic, and various prices seem to have gradually become firm. Several shares of the Hua Cheng Tobacco Company were traded yesterday at a price of 22 yuan, which is slightly firmer than before.</p>
<h3>Cocoons are Shipped to Hamburg: Another Material Among Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Raw silk cocoons are also a newly invented use among military supplies. Since August 13th, approximately from November of the 26th year, more than 20,000 tons of dry cocoons have been shipped to Germany to date (equivalent to more than 340,000 dan according to the old scale). Before the transportation was completed, another 214 tons of dry cocoons were shipped to Hamburg, Germany yesterday by a British steamer, and the quality of the cocoons was not allowed to be pressed or folded, for fear of damaging the silk quality, because they are for military use.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculation is Prevalent in the Spot Yarn Market, Double Horse Yarn is Actually Seen as the Standard. 75% of All Transactions are Done by Fellow Merchants, and the "Rubber Ball" Trade in Japanese Yarn is Still Quite Lively</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable as usual, and customers from South China and Yunnan are still accepting coarse and fine yarns quite well. Merchants from Hong Kong also come to purchase, which makes people more determined. However, other regions are still stagnant and weak, and there is no news of any action in eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, the selling price of spot yarn has not been able to rise much, and the increase is more peaceful. Some yarn prices have even weakened due to poor sales. However, the 20s Double Horse yarn produced by Shenxin No. 9 Factory is extremely popular, and non-industry people and financial circles are hoarding it extremely enthusiastically. Some people are even buying it at a premium, which shows how strong their interest is. The reason why hoarders only collect the Double Horse yarn brand is because it is selling well on the market, and there is a market price every day. In addition, the factory ships a lot of goods, and the sales channels for customers are also wide. Once there are changes, it is easy to enter and exit without being hindered. Therefore, people who are thinking of speculation treat it as a standard.</p>
<p>Checking the situation of the spot yarn market, the momentum at the beginning of the morning session was flat. However, banks were commissioning huge amounts of Double Horse warehouse orders, but the opening price was not much different from the previous day. Customer sales were also not strong, and the spot price was actually opened 1.5 yuan lower. After a while, the collection by fellow merchants became more enthusiastic, and Hong Kong merchants also put in bids for Double Horse spot goods, turning to rise. After that, the price was uneven in the middle, fluctuating between one and two yuan. Until closing, Double Horse yarn rose again, closing at 404 yuan. Checking the Double Horse warehouse orders, they were very popular, with 550 bales traded. In addition, 700 bales of Inu Musume and Double Horse spot warehouse orders were also traded, which shows that speculative trading is very active in the market. 2,235 bales were traded in the morning, with fellow merchants accounting for three-quarters and customer transactions accounting for 555 bales. In terms of prices, 20s Double Horse yarn rose by 2 yuan compared to the previous day, Inu Musume was flat, Double Globe rose by 3 yuan, Te Jin Cheng was flat, and 10s coarse yarn rose by 1 or 2 yuan. Only 10s Double Globe rose by 4 yuan. It is heard that Chongxin Factory launched 3,000 bales of 20s Da Fa at a price of 390 yuan to 405 yuan, spot price, and February-March futures were sold out. The amount bought by each region is listed on the left.</p>
<p>The situation in the Japanese yarn market is still sluggish as before, with very slow actual demand. There is no business in any region, so the market price is bleak and weak. Only the "rubber ball" trade in this month is still quite lively. The spot price of 20s Mizutsuki yarn is 317 yuan to 6 yuan, and the price for this month is 316 yuan to 15 yuan. The spot price of 20s Blue Phoenix yarn is 313 yuan to 12 yuan, and the price for this month is 301.5 yuan to 07 yuan.</p>
<p>80 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 30 bales to Amoy, 360 bales to Swatow, 120 bales to Hong Kong, 90 bales to Haikou, 160 bales to Beihai, and 800 bales to Haiphong today for export.</p>
<p>Because the inventory of native cotton is very thin and the arrival of goods is becoming increasingly rare, the price of native cotton is rising day by day, while the price of foreign cotton is decreasing daily. Therefore, trade has been very lively recently. Even the cotton firms have purchased a large amount. Yesterday, in terms of Chinese factories, Shenxin again imported 2,000 bales of Indian cotton, 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton, and 2,000 bales of American upland Sinter. The price delivered to the factory was 71 yuan. Chongxin also imported 2,000 bales of American upland Sinter. Tongcheng Company imported a total of 2,000 bales of White Rock and Omera. The price delivered to the dock was 71 yuan and 65 yuan. There were also other cotton firms that imported more than 2,000 bales of Indian cotton. The amount of transactions and prices are listed below.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Stalemate</h3>
<p>Difficult to Break for the Time Being</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price of silk in New York, Japanese silk 83 cents up 4 cents, 75 cents up 3 cents, Shanghai silk 78 cents and Guangdong silk each up 2 cents. Lyon Japanese silk up 1.50 francs, Shanghai silk A up 1.50 francs, B up 1 franc. The futures market price on the exchange slightly rebounded by half a cent to two and a half cents. Yokohama spot futures rose by two to three yuan.</p>
<p>The white factory silk trade of foreign firms in this port is still firm, and the purchasing interest of users and hoarders also seems to be satisfied. Because the price of silk has risen too quickly and the distance from overseas market prices is too far, it also makes people dare not be too optimistic. The dry cocoon price was sold at 330 yuan yesterday, and cocoon merchants have already discussed the price to more than 350 yuan, which is equivalent to a silk cost of nearly 1400 yuan. Recent forecasts for the silk market are that it is temporarily impossible to break the deadlock. Foreign firms only had Indian silk transactions yesterday. Users first absorbed and purchased factory silk of good brands, and then asked for lower prices. The total transaction volume was 30 dan. 193 pieces of Huzhou silk were transported to Europe yesterday.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Tea are Transported to Europe</h3>
<p>In the tea market of foreign firms in this port, Yongxing, Jardine Matheson, and Xiehe and other firms have transacted more than 340 boxes of Fine Eyebrow tea, all of which are high and middle-grade goods. The highest selling price was 145 to 173 yuan, and the lowest was 802 to 805 yuan. Although there are still more than 4,600 pieces of samples on display, the number of fast-selling goods such as high and middle-grade Fine Eyebrow Pearl Tea is relatively rare. The inventory of low-grade goods such as Needle Eyebrow and Elegant Eyebrow is relatively abundant. Therefore, various foreign firms still intend to suppress prices. 212 tons of tea were transported to Europe yesterday, and 100 pieces of tea bricks were transported from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Due to the uncertain trend of the European political situation, the foreign cotton market price caused a sharp drop in securities. The cotton market was also depressed by this blow. Regarding government loans for cotton, the Ministry of Agriculture has submitted another suggestion to the government, stipulating that the method is to reward those who are willing to abandon cotton fields and not plant them, and the amount of cotton they should receive can be allocated from a portion of the government's loan cotton. This method can reduce the production of new cotton and reduce the government's cotton reserves. The government may have hope of implementing it. Yesterday, New York fell by ten British pence, India, including forecasts, fell by two rupees, and Egypt Liverpool fell by two or three pounds sterling. The exchange rate rose slightly yesterday, and the legal currency price of cotton all fell. American cotton and Brazilian cotton each fell by more than 1 yuan and 2 jiao per dan, while Indian cotton and Kampuchea cotton fell by more than 1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Swatow Golden Hook Shrimp Tails</h3>
<p>Sold as Soon as They Arrive, Kylin Vegetables are Stable</p>
<p>Swatow Golden Hook Shrimp Tails arrived yesterday, and the goods are still good and were immediately sold out. The higher ones were 95 yuan, and the lower ones were 90 yuan. The trend is stable, sales can be said to be good, and the market is stable. Yesterday, West Orchid vegetables sold for 20 yuan and 5 jiao, and Dragon Tooth vegetables for 19 yuan.</p>
<h3>Arrivals are Declining, Native Cotton Transactions are Tax-Reduced, Cotton Firms are Switching to Foreign Cotton</h3>
<p>The native cotton business is still scarce, but the selling price is firmly constant. The flower shops are still constantly buying and selling white-packaged cotton, but the factories have never purchased it. Japanese factories have no action at all, and all transactions are done by fellow merchants. The amount is limited, and the number of carriers is even smaller. In fact, arrivals from all sides are declining, and the inventory on the market is scarce. Under this environment, Chinese and foreign factories have no choice but to purchase foreign cotton to make up for the situation. Therefore, the purchase of Indian cotton has been increasing day by day. The cotton firms, seeing the chaotic situation in the mainland and the gradual depletion of cotton stocks in the cotton-producing areas, have changed their principles and are trading in American and Indian cotton. The source of supply in the Subei area is still quite abundant. 3,777 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the dock. 50 bales of cotton were exported to Swatow, 520 bales to Hong Kong, and 80 bales to Beihai. In addition, 1,200 bales of cotton came from Haimen, and 310 bales of cotton came from Baimao. The amount of spot cotton traded and the market price are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Renamed Japanese Goods are Mixed with Domestic Cloth and Shipped to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Su Lun Factory that was Seized is Shipping Goods to Shanghai for Sale</p>
<p>National Cloth: As yarn prices rise, domestic cloth hoarders choose to hoard cheaper goods, and the financial circles are also quite interested. However, except for merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan, spot sales are generally weak. The price of colored cloth and fancy goods is particularly firm and high, while the market price of white goods is chaotic. Small amounts are cheaper than wholesale. Swatow merchants telegraphed that local rumors are very rampant, and each shipment is handled slowly, but the goods that need to be sold urgently are still being shipped. After the price increase of Yihuo coarse cloth, small amounts of spot goods on the market are 1-2 jiao cheaper according to the market. Nearly 100 pieces have been purchased by this street and merchants from Ningbo. Hong Kong merchants continue to purchase fine twill of domestic goods. 30-40 pieces were transacted yesterday. Fine cloth and twill of renamed Japanese goods are also mixed with domestic goods and shipped there. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan have been actively placing bids, transacting more than 300 pieces of flower crepe de chine, flower cloth, satin, foreign yarn, stripe bleached cloth, Shanglin cloth, and bleached twill. Merchants from Yunnan have also purchased 300 pieces of February futures.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth: In the morning market, the selling price of white goods was weak due to the strong selling wind in the market. Bids on this street were sluggish, and fine cloth and fine twill continued to soften. Longtou fine cloth was once bid at 11 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. Later, it was heard that merchants from Yantai and Qingdao were taking action, purchasing 300-400 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. There were also a few transactions on this street, and the situation turned firm, but the market price still fell by about 2 and a half fen per piece compared to the previous day. The output of factories in the occupied areas that are forcibly occupied and controlled by the Japanese has been sold on the market yesterday, including Shenying coarse cloth and fine cloth from Suzhou Su Lun Factory, which are distributed by Nei Wai Mian Co. The opening price of 16-pound Blue Shenying coarse cloth is 13 yuan and 2 jiao per piece, and the opening price of 12-pound Shenying fine cloth is 10 yuan and 9 jiao. The wholesale dealers on this street bought 50 bales. Merchants from Kaifeng handled more than 40 boxes of new flower serge and broadcloth, satin from Nei Wai, Meihua, Guangtai and other factories, all of which were shipped in postal packages. Flower serge is 4 jiao and 1 and a half fen per yard, flower broadcloth is 4 jiao and 2 and a half fen, and satin of each grade is between 10 yuan and 034 jiao per piece.</p>
<p>Export: 40 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen, 350 pieces to Swatow, 20 pieces to Hong Kong, 55 pieces to Haikou, 80 pieces to Beihai, 520 pieces to Haiphong, and 50 pieces to Yantai today.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Rises Sharply and Then Falls Slightly, Raw Oil is Quietly Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot and near-term prices of soybean oil were firm, but the far-term prices fell slightly. The overall trend is under a high wave and cannot escape the situation of a small pullback. A total of 500 pieces of Yantai Qishan oil were opened, priced at 21 yuan. More than 100 pieces of Dalian Qi soybean oil were priced at 26 yuan and 2 jiao. More than 70 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were priced at 28 yuan, 2 jiao and a half to 3 jiao. 50 barrels for delivery in three or four days were priced at 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. 100 barrels for delivery at the end of January were priced at 28 yuan and 05 fen and 27 yuan and 9 jiao. 100 barrels to be loaded in the second half of January were priced at 27 yuan and a quarter jiao and a half. 50 barrels to be loaded in the second half of February were priced at 28 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. Although peanut oil did not trade yesterday, it is said that under the insufficient supply, the market situation is quite popular. Among the export goods, 410 tins of raw oil are being shipped to Xiamen today, and 240 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Grains: Insufficient Flour Production</h3>
<p>Still Difficult to Fully Supply Demand, More Than 20,000 Bags Exported Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market continued to be active, but it was difficult for transactions to become active again. Because the current production of each factory is insufficient, it is still difficult to fully supply large merchants, and the number of customer sales is also scattered. Yesterday, in the Tianjin market, the demand for flour from the artillery, navy ships, etc. gradually improved. Merchants from Nanyang, Swatow and other places are also purchasing goods for the New Year one after another. The total market transaction volume continued to be more than 60,000 bags, including retail sales on this street. The original price of each brand of No. 2 flour was 4 yuan and 8 jiao, while Hong Caishen and Hong Xinghua flour did not trade.</p>
<p>The export of flour today includes 10,000 bags to Tianjin, 2,000 bags to Xiamen, and 9,500 bags to Swatow.</p>
<h3>Wheat Merchants are Unwilling to Sell Cheaply, Large Quantities of Miscellaneous Grains are Shipped to the South</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for wheat from the factories decreased sharply, the production price did not loosen, and the arrivals gradually decreased. In addition, the second batch of Fufeng Ding wheat still has to arrive in Shanghai at the end of this month. Therefore, most of the wheat in stock on the market is unwilling to depreciate and sell off again. The factory is also difficult to suppress the price, so the downward trend in the market has gradually subsided. High-grade goods are all fixed, while the price of mid-grade goods and tide wheat is still uneven. The bulk of the transactions in the whole market was Wuhu wheat, followed by Jiangbei Nanjing wheat, totaling more than 5,000 bags, which was purchased by Fuxin Factory for 3,000 bags and Fufeng Factory for 2,000 bags. The highest price was still 6 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Among the miscellaneous imports, 200 bags of soybeans were transported from Haimen yesterday. In terms of exports, 525 tons of beans were transported to Bombay, and 248 tons were transported to Columbus yesterday. Today, there are also 1,000 bags of wheat bran shipped to Swatow, 550 bags of beans shipped to Xiamen, 2,200 bags of beans shipped to Swatow, 1,760 bags of beans shipped to Swatow, 690 pieces of bean cakes shipped to Swatow, 400 bags of raw peanuts shipped to Swatow, and 4,770 bags of peanuts shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Glutinous Rice is Uniquely Popular, Japonica Rice is Sluggish, Cannot Escape the Law of Supply and Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, each grade of japonica rice showed a small decline. Only glutinous rice was popular, because there were only 300 bags in the whole city, and the sales of tea shops and distilleries were very good. The sellers immediately hoarded the goods and raised the price to 15 yuan. After repeated bargaining, the transaction was finally opened at 14 yuan and 8 jiao for special grade goods. The market had already risen by 2 jiao, which was truly unpredictable. As for the other grades of japonica rice, although there were only five ships from the lower reaches of the river, as many as 10,000 bags arrived by steamer, and about 5,000 bags arrived by train. It is said that it was due to the financial situation near the end of the year, which made people even more nervous. Most of the merchants were on the sidelines, and the upper half of the market was completely silent and without any transactions. Later, after the sellers changed their course and sold off, they were still unable to get the acceptance of the buyers. Therefore, as a result, the amount purchased by the merchants and hoarders on this street was no more than about 4,000 bags. This kind of quiet scene has not been seen in recent months, and the price of thick and thin japonica rice has fallen by more than 1 jiao. Du Yangjian and Bu Jian also had difficulty standing firm at this time, and they all declined by a similar amount.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Indica Rice Production Price is Reported to be Rising</h3>
<p>Customers are Competing to Handle Direct Transshipment, and the Selling Price of Foreign Rice is Also Seeing an Increase</p>
<p>The morning market of Ke indica rice continued to be weak, and each Jingwu indica rice once continued to decline by 4-5 fen. Then, news came from Wuhu that the shippers were directly transshipping and competing to handle it, and the market price rose by 3-4 jiao. The owners immediately hoarded the goods and refused to continue selling them. The market also gradually rebounded, and the special high-grade goods were again quoted at 11 yuan, and the market price of Wuhu indica rice had also crossed 10 yuan. However, the current stock in Shanghai is full, and the source of supply by rail is endless. How will the later market be, it is still difficult to predict. Yesterday, the purchase by each merchant on this street was more active, and the transaction volume for the whole day was more than 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>The scattered sales of foreign rice have gradually become active recently, and the stock on the market is scarce. Hoarders are holding firm, and floating goods have been sold out. Therefore, the market price of vendors and distributors is taking the opportunity to increase. No. 1 Saigon, including freight, has been quoted at 14 yuan and 5-6 jiao, and the net price without freight is also asking for 14 yuan and 3-4 jiao, which is an increase of 2-3 jiao compared to the selling price at the beginning of the month.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaozhou Sugar is Upside Down</h3>
<p>The sugar market was still stable yesterday. 200 bags of #24 raw sugar and transshipment goods were traded at a price of 16 yuan and 8 jiao, and spot goods were quoted at 25 yuan and 1 jiao, but no transactions were made. Taikoo sugar did not fluctuate much. Merchants from Chaozhou quoted dozens of bags of special white domestic sugar at a price of 19 yuan and 5 jiao, and more than 100 bags of red sand sugar at 15 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. According to news, the newly extracted Zhuang Qing Hua Shen of Chaozhou sugar requires 15 yuan, but it is difficult to approach this price here for the time being, forming an upside-down phenomenon. 230 bags of sugar came from Quanzhou yesterday, and 90 bags came from Dianhua.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Xingquan Round Dates Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>230 boxes of round dates were shipped from Quanzhou yesterday, 480 boxes from Xinghua, 390 boxes from Xiumu, and 10 boxes of longan pulp from Father Quanzhou. Boxes of honey dates were shipped from Xinghua.</p>
<h3>Coal: High and Low-Grade Bituminous Coal are Mixed and Sold</h3>
<p>Although the demand for each grade of bituminous coal has recently increased sharply, high-grade goods are often too expensive, and it is not easy to raise the selling price, making sales difficult. However, the use of only low-grade goods has low flames and is easy to solidify in the furnace, so it is not welcomed by customers. Therefore, it is necessary to mix high and low-grade goods to reduce costs. Yesterday, a certain firm opened more than 200 tons of Karazi coal, most of which was this type of goods. The price of lump coal was 34 yuan and 5 jiao, and the price of mixed coal was 33 yuan, which was quite prosperous.</p>
<h3>Letter: Inquiry about Small Flour Milling Machines</h3>
<p>I recently received a letter from Mr. Jia Li Song of Huangqiao, stating that most of the flour is still supplied by animal-powered mills, the quality of the flour is poor, and the cost is not low. He has long intended to set up a small flour factory to increase production. He has sent letters to several foreign firms in Shanghai to inquire about small flour milling machines, but has not received any guidance. He now thinks that since you are familiar with the Shanghai market, you must also know about this situation. Therefore, I boldly send this letter to you, and respectfully ask you to inform us of which factories or foreign firms in Shanghai sell small flour milling steel mills and steel screens with 3-10 horsepower, how much flour is produced per hour, what is the selling price, and the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of domestic and European and American products. It would be even better if you could provide drawings and instructions.</p>
<p>Editor: The inquiry matter does not involve editorial matters. Mr. Song's original letter is very long and his intention is profound. In the era of the War of Resistance, we must all do our best to achieve results, so we publish it for him. If each factory, foreign firm, and the general public know of this kind of machine, please let us know so that we can pass it on.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Amity</h3>
<p>— Yan Gong</p>
<p>"Amity" is a term frequently used by diplomats. When used normally, it embodies the principle of "good neighborliness" and "beneficial neighborliness," which China considers the cornerstone of a nation's foreign policy. Its purpose is to create peaceful coexistence and shared prosperity among nations. The prerequisite is that it must be built upon the foundations of "justice," "peace," and "integrity." However, current ambitious individuals are fully utilizing "amity" as a tool for "collusion," "deception," and "enticement." Though their rhetoric may be flowery and deceptive, in reality, it is nothing more than a "smokescreen" or a "sugar-coated pill."</p>
<p>The opposite of "amity" is "hatred." The amity touted by aggressors is inherently immoral and unreasonable. In form, it is a smile concealing a dagger. In effect, it is used to fool and scheme against others. Therefore, the result is the continuous creation of indelible "hatred" throughout the world. Even if such conspiracies and cunning schemes succeed temporarily, they only sow the seeds of future struggles and slaughters, and ultimately fail to provide a fundamental solution.</p>
<p>The application of amity in international relations has reached an extreme level of sophistication. To echo each other and collude in implementing "blackmail," "intimidation," and "fraud," Eastern and Western aggressors use amity as a pretext to form aggressive cliques. They call themselves "anti-communist allies," but in reality, they have no intention of opposing communism, dare not oppose communism, and are unable to oppose communism. Their sole aim is to prey on the weak.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy used this alluring term to entice Britain and France, achieving great success at the Munich Conference, which resulted in the sacrifice of Czechoslovakia, carving it up again and again. Hitler was victorious, and Mussolini followed by demanding French territory, presenting a continuous performance of extortion in turns.</p>
<p>Our Eastern neighbor, a "friendly nation," has long used this term, dreaming of progressing from "amity" to "guidance," then to "exclusive control of China" and "annexation of China," ultimately to dominate the world. It is a pity that China has long seen through its treachery. No matter how much it talks to itself, China has shattered its conspiracies with iron and blood. Unable to succeed in its designs on China, it turned its guns and, imitating Germany and Italy, shamelessly proclaimed itself a pillar of peace, singing a one-sided love song, hoping to rebuild amity with Britain to facilitate its attempt to annex China. However, Britain has learned its lesson and will not fall for Japan's tricks. More importantly, China is not Czechoslovakia. Shigemitsu Mamoru's speech felt like mere groveling.</p>
<h3>"Kingly Way" Propaganda in a Tramcar</h3>
<p>— Da Kang</p>
<p>The No. 5 bus, carrying the lingering burnt smell of the ruined Shanshan Road, destroyed by gunfire, traveled directly from the end of North Henan Road towards San Mao Ge. The tramcar was not crowded. Perhaps because of the tragic awe that arose when passing the desolate Baoshan Road, which resembled a graveyard, the passengers' faces displayed a contemplative silence; everyone was listless.</p>
<p>When the tram stopped at the Tianhougong Bridge stop, a large number of passengers surged in, and the air in the tramcar was suddenly disturbed. As the tram started moving, strangely, the passengers all became lively, their eyes darting at each other. Amid the conductor's shouts, some passengers fumbled for coins, some lit cigarettes, and others seemed to be about to start conversations.</p>
<p>At this moment, a burly fellow, wearing a black broadcloth overcoat and a brown bowler hat, was vying with a short man next to him to buy tickets: "Let me! Let me!" "Ah! Let me! Let me!" Their politeness was overly familiar, attracting the special attention of the tramcar passengers. After this display of excessive courtesy, they each took their seats. Then, the burly fellow began to speak in a loud voice:</p>
<p>"Hey, hey! Do you know? Recently, a notice was posted in Hongkou saying that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has accepted Wang Jingwei's peace negotiation terms and is preparing to make peace with Japan!"</p>
<p>"Really?" The short man was somewhat surprised, but immediately relaxed, sighed, and then slowly said, "It's really not reasonable for China to keep fighting Japan like this! Alas! Wouldn't it be better to make peace with Japan, and everyone could do business harmoniously?"</p>
<p>The burly fellow had already lit a cigarette, exhaled a puff of thick smoke, and then said with emphasis, "Isn't that right?" Then, raising his voice a little, he said, "Fighting like this only makes the common people suffer! Look, the common people in the interior are suffering from the guerrillas; it's really hard to describe!"</p>
<p>The short man frowned, slapped his thigh hard with his right hand, seemingly a little indignant, and raised his voice as well: "Speaking of guerrillas, damn it, they are extremely hateful!..."</p>
<p>Then, the short man began to talk about the "hatefulness" of the guerrillas.</p>
<p>At this time, the passengers in the tramcar were looking at the two fellows discussing "national affairs" with resentful eyes. But the burly fellow spoke up again: "Resistance, resistance, only leads to scorched earth!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, both fellows sighed deeply, but among the passengers, some angrily cursed out loud. "Traitors! Traitors!"</p>
<p>"Bullshit!" At the same time, curses echoed in the tramcar.</p>
<p>But Simalu arrived. The burly fellow and the short man stood up together and got off the tram. As the tram started moving again, resentful curses filled the tramcar: "Shameless beasts!" "Next time I encounter such people, I will definitely beat them to death!"...</p>
<p>All the way to San Mao Ge Bridge, although the passengers got off the tram, their faces were still filled with an intensely resentful red.</p>
<h3>Talking about the Fake "Stamp Tax"</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>Please Carefully Distinguish When Purchasing Stamp Tax to Avoid Being Fooled</p>
<p>Since the fall of Greater Shanghai, the stamp tax has suffered unprecedented misfortune. Post offices were forced to stop selling it, and patriotic merchants could only suffer under the condition of "post offices no longer selling, no way to purchase and affix stamps!" But soon, the stamp tax of the National Government was transported from Hong Kong to Shanghai and entrusted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to distribute to various trade associations for sale. At the same time, the pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau" also issued pseudo "stamp tax," but formal merchants mostly did not buy it, so it fell into a state of suspension. Now let's talk about this pseudo "stamp tax," because its style is similar to the real one, and it is feared that it will be confused with the real thing, deceiving general merchants who are not very literate: at the same time, it can also make everyone able to understand it clearly!</p>
<p>This kind of pseudo "stamp tax" is divided into eight kinds: a total of six small sizes and two large sizes. It also has distinctions between one-cent, two-cent, and yellow and blue colors. If we divide it into value and color, it has the following:</p>
<p>One cent (yellow) Two cents (blue) One dime ( color) Two dimes (light blue) Five dimes (purple) One yuan (red) The above small size has a total of six kinds</p>
<p>One dime (rose) One yuan (dark yellow) The above large size has a total of two kinds</p>
<p>The value and color are roughly as described above. As for the surface, the four weeks are also surrounded by patterns like real stamps, but the middle is different from the real ones. It is printed with a pagoda, next to which is one of the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon in West Lake in Hangzhou, embraced by forests in the back, and mountains hidden behind the forests; the words on the stamp, the small size is printed with "Suzhou, Zhejiang, Anhui Stamp Tax Ticket," and the English value is printed similarly to the real ones, for example, one cent is printed with Cent, and one yuan is printed with r.Dollar. In addition to having the same words as the small size, the large size also adds the four characters "Republic of China" on the top. This may be used to deceive the eyes of the Chinese people?</p>
<p>Therefore, due to the puppets' deliberate efforts, general merchants, especially merchants on isolated islands, must thoroughly distinguish stamp purchases!</p>
<h3>A Group Who Live by Submitting Articles</h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>After reading "A Group Who Live by Submitting Articles," I was very moved, because every day, a small amount of "crystallization of blood" is thrown into the character basket by me, but this different treatment - in fact, there are also many unavoidable difficulties - this is what every contributor should forgive. At the same time, every supplement needs readers, writers, and editors to work together. I sincerely hope that readers will often give us advice, and writers will give us valuable materials, I am very fortunate. - Editor</p>
<p>Each time, during the few days when the newspaper office issues payment for articles, the payment window of the accounting office is always crowded with many people. Of course, young people account for the majority of these people. They line up in order, one by one taking out the payment for their articles, some for a few cents, some for a few yuan, and even some for dozens of yuan; after checking the amount, they leave the payment window with a smile. In this way, starting from the hour when the payment for articles begins, all the way until the hour when the payment for articles stops, in those two hours, the few accountants are only busy receiving the payment receipts, checking the payment books, and calculating the payment amounts, busy almost without even having the time to drink tea.</p>
<p>Everyone takes the payment for their articles, and then breathes a sigh of relief, stepping out of the door of that newspaper office; but among these people receiving payment, there are also many different psychologies, for example, some people, having received the legal tender exchanged for their month's hard work, are preparing to repay debts, pay rent, buy firewood and rice, while others want to use the payment to buy a few paintings or add a little something else. However, I believe that among the general contributing comrades at present, the majority should belong to the former. Some of them, although they have a job, the income is not enough, so they use submitting articles as a side job to make up for it. Some are unemployed friends, and naturally the only way out is to sell their writing to make a living, racking their brains and straining their hearts all day long in order to support their families, and the situation is indeed very miserable. As for the latter, their writing and ink-slinging is originally a casual and occasional act, at most they only want to earn a little payment for articles to buy a few books to read. Therefore, the contributors belonging to the latter are mostly from the student world. And these people do not necessarily write regularly.</p>
<p>The exact number of people who submit articles in Shanghai is impossible to count, but I believe that the number of people who make a living by submitting articles must be not small, because in addition to the writers of magazines and other periodic publications, and the special writers of newspaper offices, there are more than a dozen kinds of daily and evening newspapers (large newspapers) in Shanghai where one can submit articles. Although the payment for articles varies in thickness and the required materials are different, the avenues for submitting articles are always many. For example, each daily newspaper has at least two supplements, and the evening newspapers also have one supplement, and the texts published inside are nothing more than general literary works, short essays, essays, prose, and miscellaneous essays, etc., and there are very few supplements discussing specialized academics. In addition, in addition to the telegraphic edition and the manuscripts supplied by general news agencies, newspapers also welcome external manuscripts for local news, local news, the economics edition, education and sports, and valuable features, so contributors only need to choose the subject they are closest to and most familiar with, write and submit it to the newspaper office they want to submit to. Then, if they are lucky, they may even have the possibility of being extended as a special writer.</p>
<p>However, although there are so many avenues for submitting articles in Shanghai, there are still many disappointed contributors, because on each editor's desk (especially the supplement editor), there are always at least thirty or more letters of manuscripts piled up every day, and the fate of these letters is that the majority are sentenced to the character basket, a part is sent back to the contributor by the postman, and another part is kept by the editor in the drawer, ready to be revised and published, or to be published when there is a shortage of manuscripts, as for those that are published, there are only three or four recommendations, accounting for only one-tenth of the total.</p>
<p>Ah! Those sentenced to the character basket, those returned by the postman, those kept by the editor, those published in the newspaper, are all the crystallization of the contributor's heart, but they receive different treatments. As for the smiling faces we see when receiving payment for articles, we cannot imagine the sorrow of those who have no share in receiving payment!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Engineer Lin Cleverly Explains Standardization, Guide Jin Eloquently Discusses Equality</p>
<p>As they were joking, they heard a woman's voice calling out, "Sister Danyun! Where did you come from!" When everyone looked over, they saw a beautiful young woman, about twenty years old, with a snow-white scarf tied around her chest, dressed as a waitress, walking over with chopsticks, plates, and other food. Jin Danyun hurriedly stood up and said, "Oh! Sister Jing, are you serving here?" It turned out that the woman's surname was Wang, and her given name was Jing, and she was a relative of Jin Danyun. Wang Jing walked over with a smile, nodded slightly to Lin Jiancheng, seeming to know him, but it was the first time she had met the two Miss He, and she did not recognize them. Jin Danyun hurriedly introduced them to each other, and said, "This Miss Wang Jing is also a relative of ours." Wang Jing then handed over the menu and said, "Please order! There are not many dishes to eat these days." Miss Jin accepted the menu, and she turned to make tea. At this time, the two Miss He were somewhat puzzled. Yu Danyun knew what they meant, and said: "This Sister Wang Jing, she is also a teacher at the Yu Clan School here. They do not know what to do, but they have made an exchange condition with this restaurant, and they must come to this restaurant for a few days each month as waitresses. Either elementary school teachers or high school students, a class of seven or eight people, probably this period is her turn." He Shuangyu said: "We used to be at the Charity Association. I have also been a waitress, but I have never been a waitress on a long-term rotation basis." He Yuyu said: "The trend of waitresses has been popular in Guangdong for a long time, but it has always been regarded as a lowly service, and noble people do not bother to do it." Jin Danyun said: "This is also slowly changing. For example, in a place like Shanghai, various restaurants and teahouses have been employing women for a long time. In the past, women were employed as a tool to attract bees and butterflies to eat. And it is beautifully called a female hostess, a group of bad teenagers often say: "Hey! Let's go to a female hostess!" You think: to eat a female hostess, is it a kind of phrase? But that group of female hostesses also takes the blame, but at first it was such a society, and there was no way to deal with it. Since our country's war, men have men's affairs, restaurant waiters, etc., all use women, and there are also those erotic men, for the female waiters who are prettier, the small accounts are especially increased. Later, the Women's Service Agency issued a mnemonic-style leaflet and posted it in various restaurants and teahouses where women serve, saying: "Those who pay small accounts to women are insulting women." Such a warning to them. (22)</p>

<h3>A Conversation with Director Cheng Bugao</h3>
<p>— Nie Ge, Sent from Hong Kong</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the famous director Cheng Bugao Guang Sheng left Shanghai and joined the Central Film Studio, devoting himself to the production of national defense films. National defense films were indeed an important part of cultural propaganda during the War of Resistance; but when some salvation work urgently needed cadres, Mr. Cheng transferred to this salvation work group.</p>
<p>The author had the opportunity to meet this film artist practicing salvation work at a banquet. We talked from far to near, and then talked about the question of some Shanghai tabloids spreading rumors and creating incidents against him. Regarding this, Mr. Cheng was very indignant. He said: On this opportunity to come to Hong Kong, he took the time to return to Shanghai to visit his family, whom he had been separated from for more than a year, because the family in Shanghai had sent many letters and telegrams, eagerly hoping that he would return once, but when he arrived in Shanghai, although it was only a few days of stay, rumors arose, and all kinds of unreasonable suspicions were made about him and Tan Ying. A person who is engaged in salvation work, when he arrives in Shanghai under another force, and his family is in Shanghai, naturally cannot publicize that he is a person engaged in salvation work, so Mr. Cheng turned a deaf ear to the various unfounded statements made by some newspapers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Many old friends in Shanghai asked him to stay in Shanghai. Zhang Shankun was willing to hire him to join Xinhua with high pay, and his family even hoped that he would stay in Shanghai, but for the sake of the five-thousand-year-old motherland, he was unwilling to abandon salvation work before the war ended.</p>
<p>He was very angry about the decline of general film artists after the War of Resistance. He said well: "The War of Resistance is like a mirror. Those who are base and filthy, those who are pure and clean, those who are brave and advancing, those who are afraid of death and decadent, and even the national sinners who are traitors and running dogs, all reflected their forms after the outbreak of the War of Resistance!"</p>
<p>Indeed, as far as the film industry, a link in the cultural world, is concerned, before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there was no shortage of people who chanted patriotic slogans, but after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, most of the most base and filthy people were these people. On the contrary, those who had never proclaimed their dedication to the country on the surface participated in actual salvation work during this War of Resistance. The War of Resistance is truly a mirror; it reflects everyone's form, and it is impossible to escape.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng also said that the life of a film practitioner is inevitably a bit "romantic." In the past, he almost went to the dance hall every night to seek anesthesia, but now his life has become the most serious and disciplined. He has forgotten all the enjoyment, and in fact he is not allowed to have time for enjoyment. In Shanghai, he traveled by car or rickshaw, but now he mostly walks, which is the most serious period of his life. But he did not think it was bitter. He said: How many times has there been such a conscious war in Chinese history? This time it is to wash away all the previous shame and reclaim the blood debt of the past, and every individual should work hard for salvation during this period.</p>
<p>Some people have satirized him like this: Can China be saved by relying on you, Cheng Bugao, alone to participate in salvation? His answer is: It's not like that. My personal strength is small, but the strength of the group is great. If everyone has this kind of mentality, then who will do the work of saving China?</p>
<p>He is now the section chief of the Third Department of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, and his wartime monthly salary is only one hundred and twenty yuan. He sends seventy yuan back to his family in Shanghai every month, although his wife Tan Ying can also support herself in the Xinhua company. Now he has transferred to Chongqing via the coastal defense, and Yang Hansheng, who came with him, has already left before him.</p>
<h3>Gu Chuanjie's Engagement Next Month - Fiancée is a Kunqu Opera Amateur</h3>
<p>Gu Chuanjie is the only outstanding talent among the young male Kunqu opera actors. In the past, from "Xin Yuefu" to the transformation into "Xian Ni She," he had cooperated with Zhu Chuanming for a long time, but "Xian Ni She" failed repeatedly due to its highbrow nature. Later, in a certain process,</p>
<h3>Gu Chuanjie's Engagement Next Month - Fiancée is a Kunqu Opera Amateur</h3>
<p>Chuanjie and Zhu Chuanming both retired at the same time; Gu Chuanjie was determined to study and restored his original name "Zhi Cheng." He first entered Soochow University in Suzhou, and then transferred to Jinling University in Nanjing, majoring in agronomy. After graduation, he worked in the agricultural field run by Jinling University in Zhenjiang, doing a "go to the countryside" job. Only after the sound of gunfire did he put down his sickle and hoe and come to the isolated island.</p>
<p>Recently, Gu Chuanjie has been befriended by banker Yan Weiyu, and his life is quite stable. In addition to occasionally performing at the invitation of private groups, most of his time is spent on books. He is preparing to translate the gongche notation of Kunqu opera into staff notation, so that it will be easier for the general public to learn. This work has been half completed and will be contacted by a bookstore for publication.</p>
<p>Gu Chuanjie's marriage has recently been decided through the introduction of Hu Shanyuan, the editor of "Hongcha," and the engagement ceremony will be held on the third of next month. His fiancée's surname is Zhang, and she is a Kunqu opera amateur. It can be said that she and Chuanjie are comrades, and it is naturally a happy marriage.</p>
<h3>Major Changes in Roles on the Tianchan Stage - Tian Shaomei and Others to Appear Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>— Sea</p>
<p>There are major changes in roles on the Tianchan Stage. In addition to inviting Li Ruchun, Dong Zhiyang, and the Zhi Cheng brothers, there are also female actor Tian Shaomei and martial arts actor Zhang Yunhe joining. They are scheduled to appear on the 26th (Thursday), first performing old plays, and the repertoire has not yet been released. Tian Shaomei is coming to Shanghai for the first time, and her performance is excellent. The opening three-day program is said to be Jade Hall Spring, Cursing the Palace of Empress He, June Snow, Little San Mazi, etc. Zhang Jianfei, the director in charge of the stage, telegraphed from Room 35 of the China Hotel in Beiping yesterday, reporting that the roles invited were generally ready. The stage has already telegraphed 2,000 yuan to Beiping from the Shanghai Bank yesterday. That night, Gu sent personnel to meet Ming and Huang Guiqiu at their residence to discuss the overall situation, and immediately sent a telegram to Mr. Zhang, the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Zhang Jianfei, China Hotel, Beiping, Xian has been wired, Wenyuan Shou Shan will be handled as is, Jing will be changed to Yuan Shihai or Ye Shengmao, Xiaosheng is best Gao Weilian or Ru Fulan, if the payment is large, change to Du Fulong."</p>
<h3>Kuang Zhongmou - Founding the Baile World</h3>
<p>— Fang Lin</p>
<p>The Baile Commercial Plaza at the intersection of Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple, is about to be completed, and it will be realized soon. At that time, the market around Jing'an Temple will become more lively, which can be imagined. Recently, a large-scale amusement park will be discovered near the Baile Commercial Plaza, named Baile World. It is said that the capital is very strong, and the founder is Kuang Zhongmou, the owner of the former Penglai City Market in Xiaoximen, Nanshi. These days, he is designing and planning, proceeding separately, and only after things are mature will he expand publicity and engage in collecting various entertainment. At that time, the residents of Luoxi can find entertainment venues nearby, and do not have to go far away.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the Postal Savings and Remittance Group's Joint Party</h3>
<p>— Gao Ge</p>
<p>The joint party of the postal savings and remittance group of the Shanghai Federation of Money Industry Associations was a drama performance on the evening of the 21st. They borrowed the hall of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to express the spirit of amateur drama enthusiasts' research. The performance began around 7:30, and a total of four dramas were performed. The first script was "Gentleman Entertaining Guests," directed by Wei Lan, which wrote about a noble and stingy family; the second play "Chuner" was directed by Xia Feng, and this play showed the bankruptcy of the countryside. The third play "White Tea" was directed by Hu Dao; it described how college students could not even afford to eat because of economic panic, and could not afford to buy tea leaves, but they were still full of the mentality of saving people and saving the world, preparing to save those - female actors who make a living by singing, and female tailors who are under heavy pressure of life. In the end, naturally, they cannot achieve their wishes: and they are still hungry and poor, disappointed and disheartened.</p>
<p>The last play described the tragedy of workers in Shanghai who lost their jobs due to the war, titled "Dawn," directed by Wu Ming. This unemployed worker - Fusheng, who was unemployed due to the destruction of the factory, encountered a painful fate, but fortunately his wife still had a low-paying job to maintain the family's major responsibility, but it could only be said to supplement one in ten thousand.</p>
<p>Looking at the above several short plays, each has its own unique features, and in particular, the last play "Dawn" and the second play "Chuner" can fully reveal the tragic state of the real countryside and society, and arouse people's sympathy. As far as the lighting props and costumes of the entire stage are concerned, it is also worth studying. Let's talk about lighting first. I say lighting is the second life of the stage, because day, night, sadness, joy, poverty, wealth, etc.: different states can be configured and expressed by lighting, so the importance of lighting is not less than the words and actions of the actors. The configuration of the lighting is very exquisite, and naturally it can increase the brilliance of the play.</p>
<h3>A Record of Wang Yang</h3>
<p>— Mo Gufu</p>
<p>The name Wang Yang may not be unfamiliar to readers, as her name was prominently featured in the Yi Hua production, "Woman." A brief biography is listed below:</p>
<p>Wang Yang's original surname was Qian, her given name Ai Hua. According to the most reliable sources, she is only seventeen years old this year and is from Jiading. She has been adventurous since she was a child, coming to Shanghai alone at the age of fourteen to study. The athlete Qian Hangsu is her cousin.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year before last, she joined the Yi Hua Company, working in the film receiving room, receiving food and lodging in addition to a monthly salary of eight silver dollars. At that time, Qian was lively and exquisite, like a small bird nestling close to someone, and everyone who saw her loved her. She had also appeared fleetingly in films such as "Three Stars Accompanying the Moon" and "First Love," but no one paid attention to her at the time. When the "August 13th" incident broke out, Yi Hua stopped filming, and Qian's life became unstable. Unable to return to her hometown, she was in a dilemma. At that moment, Yao, an assistant cameraman from a certain company, tempted her to go to the sea to accompany dances. Qian was ignorant of the ways of the world and changed her name to Wang Yang, happily agreeing. Thus, she started at the International, then the Metropole, Paramount, and Ciro's, becoming famous in the dance scene, truly a popular dance hostess!</p>
<p>Since going to sea, a year has passed in haste. Recently, Qian told people that she must change her current life, as making a living on a volcano is very painful. Last winter, Yi Hua resumed business, and Wang Yang returned to Yi Hua as an actress, returning to her screen life. The above picture was taken when she first joined Yi Hua, a face in the shape of a duck egg, still exuding her innocent and uninhibited nature.</p>
<p>New Cantonese Opera News</p>
<h3>Luo Jiaquan Stars in Sakyamuni</h3>
<p>— Long Yun</p>
<p>The latest Xin Wu Tai stage has been performing Cantonese opera, gathering many talents. Luo Jiaquan, a lead actor in the troupe, had previously retired from the stage due to special circumstances for five years. He resolutely moved south and is showing off his skills again on the red carpet, which is highly praised by the people of Shanghai. Luo Jun can sing in the "Gong" character tone, with a stable beat and a round, clear, and moving voice. Among the four great clown actors in Guangdong, Luo Jun should be the leader in terms of singing skills. His movements are all in accordance with the rules, quite different from the clumsy and pretentious actions of ordinary amateurs. It is rumored that Luo Jun has a wealth of newly written scripts, and the play "Sakyamuni's Birth" is said to have been meticulously structured by Luo Jun with mysterious plots and innovative lyrics, and polished by famous writers. The opening date is scheduled for next Saturday evening, with a planned run of four consecutive days. According to Cantonese opera customs, the program is changed daily. A play that can be performed continuously is only a famous play like the one mentioned above, and a famous actor like Luo Jun would never dare to try it lightly. It is hoped that the patrons will wait and see.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden in the Former Capital (85)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Guo Zhongheng was Gong Yunfu's yin-yang follower</p>
<p>Besides the early death of Deng Yuanfang, among the insiders, only Wang Fengqing could inherit Da Tou's style, and among the outsiders, Guo Zhongheng. Fengqing originally sang the role of a young clown, but later changed to a civil and military young male lead. Because his voice was quite good in the past, he changed to singing the role of a bearded man. He did indeed receive three plays passed down from Da Tou: one is "Zhao Guan," the second is "Chengdu," and the third is "Taking the Master's Seal." Some say that "Zhao Guan" was revised by Da Tou, and "Cinnabar Mole" was taught by the Luo family. In any case, Fengqing had obtained the true transmission of several signature plays in the style.</p>
<p>The deceased Guo Zhongheng originally studied Western medicine, but later joined the Chunyang Society and studied Da Tou's tunes. His voice was also passable. He performed the play "Chengdu" in various associations and was praised by the audience. Later, seeing Ju Peng going to the sea as an amateur and being very popular, and the income being much higher, it was much better than being a doctor, so he also went to the sea. When Yan Qiu came to Shanghai for the first time, the old male lead and young male lead he brought were all amateurs. The old male lead was Zhongheng, and the young male lead was Wang Quan, nicknamed "Heart to God Knows." (Furthermore, Quan's sung words were completely incomprehensible, and his voice was extremely low, so his colleagues gave him this nickname). Zhongheng was a fat man, so he was very qualified to play the role of the king in the Wang Mao opera.</p>
