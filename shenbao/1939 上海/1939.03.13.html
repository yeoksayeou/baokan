<p>社評</p>
<h3>申論國民總動員</h3>
<p>一週之前，本報嘗論精神總動員事，並評述其綱領與實施辦法；尤期望於社會領袖與青年，以及各界各機構中之領導者，務身體力行。茲者，重慶電傳精神總動員綱領與實施辦法之全文，並及國民公約誓辭與其組織，具刋昨今報端，閱讀這餘，頗發見其間有若干點，不但為前論所未及，抑且為原文所未明白提示者，請申言之。</p>
<p>所謂總動員當然無例外。然若軍事總動員，以有關軍事者為限，其他勿與也。經濟總動員，以有關經濟者為限，其他勿與也。即就軍事或經濟總動員之實施而論，或分若干期，或分若干部分，在其期，與在其分者，一聲總動員令，必須立即遵令行事，自不待言；其有未及其期，不在其分者，準備而已，初非遽動；更自紀律組織與秩序言之，亦可謂不容遽動。故各種總動員之所謂無例外，固猶相對之原則也。精神總動員則不然，凡屬國民，務須一律接受，一體行事，而絕對無例外，此應認識者一也。</p>
<p>凡百集會，以信仰為中心，以志願為發動；故適用所謂結社自由，思想自由，言論自由，要之，槪以自由為原則；惟自由，故不盡同，亦不强同；道合志同，斯為一會。今之精神總動員，在組織上亦以會稱，中央省縣，莫不稱會，并以國防最高委員會委員長兼會長。顧其性質，與其他之凡百集會，逈不相侔。申言之，國民之於精神總動員會，决非志願者始參加，亦决不容許有所謂志不同道不合之國民；若於精神總動員而竟謂道不同志不合，則决非會員與否之問題，而根本上發生其為國民與否之問題。職是之故，凡屬國民，當然在精神總動員之列，亦卽當然在精神總動員會之中；無例外，亦决不許置身事外，此應認識者二也。</p>
<p>動員：是事實，是行為，必具體，必積極；獨精神總動員稍稍異是，國民公約僅為左列十二條：</p>
<p>（一）不違背三民主義、</p>
<p>（二）不違背政府法令、</p>
<p>（三）不違背國家民族的利益、</p>
<p>（四）不做漢奸和敵國的順民、</p>
<p>（五）不參加漢奸組織、</p>
<p>（六）不做敵軍和漢奸的官兵、</p>
<p>（七）不替敵人和漢奸帶路、</p>
<p>（八）不替敵人和漢奸探聽消息、</p>
<p>（九）不替敵人和漢奸做工、</p>
<p>（十）不用敵人和漢奸銀行的鈔票、</p>
<p>（十一）不買敵人的貨物、</p>
<p>（十二）不買糧食和一切物品給敵人和漢奸、</p>
<p>皆曰「不」，是消極之限制，亦不行為之條欵也。我人茲不必註釋凡此限制條欵具有如何積極之意義，更不必　言如何可能之功效；然此限制條欵之平凡易行，則必廳為戰時之任何國家任何國民所共認。夫以國家在抗戰時期所需於國民者而論，以國民在抗戰時期，對於國家應負之責任，應盡之義務而論，無不遠在此十二限制條欵之上；故國民而對此公約忠誠信守，猶不足以言無媿為抗戰時期之國民；今乃在精神總動員之下，所責望於國民者，僅此十二項，然則國民之應忠誠接受，可謂最低限度之義務，此應認識者三也。</p>
<p>公約所涉之事項，或有人焉，或買或賣，或以勞力生活，頗因緣為利矣；此其人，雖或逼於衣食兒孫，其心無他，然其客觀之結果，何嘗可諒！至於一般人，或以為公約所厲禁，誠無可議，然絕對信守公綂，或有不便焉，或有不利焉，惟不便不利，斯稍稍出入而猶以為可諒也。抑知善惡之分安在乎？賢不肖之分安在乎？可諒不可諒之界限且對於小已，對於目前，亦便亦利，此則人人能為之，人人樂為之，亦必人人爭為之矣；人世間豈復有惡有不肖有不可諒者哉？蓋所謂善所謂賢，必不計目前小已之利害，而惟分別是非而取舍之；明知其非，雖便已利己不為；明知其不便不利絕不茍且出入而務守其是；必如是，始為善，始為賢。換言之，善惡賢不肖之分，即在能否犧牲小己之便利，取得捨非而已；不能犧牲小己之便與利而茍且為非，固無可諒餘地也。故於公約所禁，不容為利害打算，務必忠誠信守，此應認識者四也。</p>
<h3>國民精神總動員綱領　集結國民精神於共同目標　對自身確立同一救國道德　對國家堅定同一建國信仰</h3>
<p>（重慶）國民精神總動員鋼領、（續　）</p>
<p>（五）精神之改造</p>
<p>國民所以確立之同一道德與同一信仰旣已闡明矣、於是吾人乃進而探討何者為適合於今日國家民族軍事利益而足以達成抗戰建國目的之健全精神、從而分別扶植或淘汰之、以造成共同一致之良好環境、而澈底改造我國國民之精神、類而舉之、則有下列之數項、</p>
<p>（甲）醉生夢死之生活必須改正</p>
<p>生活者、精神之根本、無合理之生活、即無健全之精神、是以沉溺於聲色貨利之醉生夢死的生活、必須加以澈底改正、而實行新生活之信條、否則不僅個人之精耗神散、自誤誤國、必致相習成風、使整個社會頓呈亡國現象、而招致世界之鄙視與寇仇之深入、不唯有害於國家、尤且影響於軍事、</p>
<p>（乙）奮發蓬勃之朝氣必須養成</p>
<p>次於醉生夢死之生活而為國民精神之蟊賊者、厥為消沉頹廢之風氣、此風氣之存在、實由於心理與心理兩方面之原因所造成、在心理方面、由於民族自信心、與個人自强心之缺乏、不謂民族無復興之望、即視民族復興之事業於已無關、此兩種心理若不糾正、國民奮發蓬勃之朝氣即無法養成、在生理方面、則運動·衛生·齊整·清潔、乃至早起之習慣、均須提倡與實行、然後能使國民精神充實、朝氣煥發、以擔當非常之革命事業、</p>
<p>（丙）茍且偷生之習性必須革除</p>
<p>抗戰中有一不可不注意之精神現象焉、即在前方之民衆欠缺誓死復仇之决心、而在後方之人員、多有避難就易之私圖也、前一現象、足使敵人之順民增多、而敵氛益張、後一現象、足使民族之戰士减少、戰意薄弱、究其動機、則皆由民族至上之觀念不固、茍且偷生之習性猶存、欲糾正前一現象、在於闡明春秋大復警主義、所謂「為國復　雖百世可也」、使　於失地之國民、永不忘國家至上民族至上之觀念、糾正後一現象、在提倡「見危授命」之風氣、表揚殉職死難之忠烈、更須嚴飭綱紀、昌明正義、使人人　視規避職守、潛圖安全、為莫大之恥辱、而後革命之精神、乃能樹立、</p>
<p>（丁）自私自利之企圖必須打破</p>
<p>只圖保全個人之生命財產、增長個人之名位與權利、而不顧民族全體之利害與存亡、亦猶有兵權者之欲保存其實力與地盤、同一自私的動機也充此自私之心理、必至私見高於一切、私和高於一切、乃至於個人名譽地位權利慾望之擴張與滿足、必先於一切、推衍所極、必至犧牲民族利益、破壞抗戰計劃而後已、今當抗戰劇烈存亡呼吸之際、而猶不自覺悟、豈唯不智、實亦不仁、在國民精神總動員之目的下、此種痼習、必須排除、所當發揚與論之權威、加以盡量之指正、務使盡袪私見、共輸肝膽、而歸於至公與至誠、</p>
<p>（戊）紛歧錯雜之思想必須糾正</p>
<p>抗戰以來、全國之思想與言論、在根本上雖已形成統一、而枝葉上紛歧、仍所在多有、若任其雜然並存、勢必導民志於吾人上述國家民族至上、軍事勝利第一、意志力量集中之原則下、確立標準、分別糾正、俾統一之基礎獲得進一步之鞏固、尤必積極疏導、造成共同之國論、俾吾國民與青年、在認識上對國家前途懷抱同一之理想、即以萬衆一心而克敵制勝、亦所以造成戰後全國永久之團結、而免於紛歧與牴牾、此之標準、當根據當前事實需要與民族利益、為全國國民所義當接受亦樂於接受者、約而舉之、則為、　不違反國民革命最高原則之三民主義、　不鼓吹超越民族之理想與損害國家絕對性之言論、　不破壞軍政軍令及行政系統之統一、　不利用抗戰形勢以達成國家民族利益以外之任何企圖、一切思想言論、悉以此準繩、有違此義、則一體糾正、共同擯絕、合乎此義、則多方獎進、使由此基礎、充實發展、蔚為風氣、</p>
<p>如上五者、僅略舉其大端、吾人欲達到國民精神之澈底改造、更須推而廣之、首求國民精神之充實、次求國民精神之集中、而更求國民之革命化、所謂充實者、即使其蓬勃煥發、堅强貞固、有克服環境抵抗艱難之力量、所謂集中者、即求其密合團結、萬衆一心、衆志成城、以達於休戚利害絕對相共及永不離散之境地、所謂革命化者、即本於愛民族愛國家之至高無上的觀念、以獻身於革命之事業、對內則矢忠於政府與主義、對外則抵抗民族之敵人、必也寶貴不能淫、貧賤不能移、威武不能屈、進而以此精神感化同胞、更進而以此精神戰勝敵國、吾國民精神之改造、誠能達此三者之標準、則國民精神總動員之目的、始可謂為完成、</p>
<p>（六）動員領導</p>
<p>精神總動員之對象、雖為全體之國民、而率先負有倡導實行之責者、則為下述各類之人員、</p>
<p>一·黨員與公務人員</p>
<p>本黨　承總理遺志、實行國民革命、春　命未成時期、本黨負政府施政之責、今多少省區、陷於　手、千萬民衆、備受摧殘、本黨黨員應如何自責自勉、切實省察其公私行動、是否是為一般國民之模範、在實施一般國民精神動員之始、首先須由黨員精神總動員、每一黨員、必須其道德的實踐、無愧於非常時期之天職、較之一般國民、必須更刻苦精勤、更節約廉介、亦更能勇敢犧牲、此就黨員言之也、至於公務人同、特別為各級行政官吏與地方自治人員、負有施行政令、協和軍民、充實軍事準備之重責、其精神行動、更須足以取得國民之信仰、堪為國民之表率、故精神總動員之實施、黨員以外、即須由公務人員首先實行、以倡導一般之國民、</p>
<p>二·全體軍人</p>
<p>吾全體軍人應一致認識　軍人之本分、不僅對敵軍之戰鬥、更應知軍隊代表國民威權、軍人應代表國民精神、且中國在一切民衆組織尚未完備之今日、國軍即為國家實力之中心、故軍人必須在道德上成為國民信仰之中心、今日救國家救民族之重大責任、全在我軍人肩上、故我全軍將士、必須首先實行軍人精神總動員、凡我軍人、絕對應具有救國道德與建國信仰、具備抗戰復興所必需之　健全精神、盡忠盡孝、時刻不忘、且須對同胞盡仁愛、對長官袍澤與部下盡信義、而最後則尤必重人道、重紀律、以發揚吾民族固有崇高之和平理想、誠使全國軍人一致力行精神動員、發揚中國固有道德的光輝、則此種偉力、其表現之於軍事者、將無可計量、而全國同胞必一致感動、一致響應、更無疑義矣、</p>
<p>三·全國各界領袖</p>
<p>吾人在實施精神動員於一般國民之前、更熱望全國文化·實業界·宗教界·與各職業團體的領袖、以及社會中堅份子、與各地之耆賢父老、均同情於國民精神總動員之　趣而躬為之侶率、抗戰以來、全國賢達、盡力為國家軍事之後盾、其貢獻甚大、而諸戰區各種文化事業與產業之被摧殘、其所受犧牲亦至鉅、但今後國家之艱難困苦、益將加深、迄今為止、全國各界在精神上所表現之力量、尚不足以應國家富前之需要、深望更進一步、率先實行精神總動員、一心一德、貢獻全部力量於國家民族、各界領袖與中堅人士能躬行實踐以為之倡、則各地方各職業部門之國民、益有以景從而風起、至於文化界·言論界·著作家之人士、更望省察國家安危民族盛衰之責任、百世禍福、千載興亡、均視各界領袖於此時機能否接受精神總動員之意旨而為共同之奮鬥以為斷、</p>
<p>四·全國靑年</p>
<p>靑年為國家之命脈、吾人對於全國曾受及現受教育之青年、無論是否失學或失業、均特致其深切之期望、國家民族之命運、在將來固全賴青年担負、而此日亦賴青年之盡瘁與努力、日本欲征服我中國、其最所仇　者、即為中國之青年、是以在敵人佔領地區、無數青年、殞身受禍、而軍　以來、前綫後方、均有不少青年忍飢耐寒、勤奮工作、此實國家所宜特別愛護與督導者、今日實施國民精神總動員、切盼全國青年、均一致參加、先於一般國民、而為熱烈之倡導、吾人特別屬望於吾國青年、一致實踐中國固有之救國道德、一致信仰三民主義·勿分歧·勿疑惑·勿頹廢·勿暴棄·一致篤信國家至上民族至上、與軍事第一、勝利第一之至理、而共同努力、以從事於抗戰復興之奮鬥、</p>
<p>（七）動員實施</p>
<p>精神動員之實施、大部份有賴於每個國民良知之自覺、而相互之勉勵與啟發、則為助成其自覺之手段、至於法紀糾繩、僅當以之輔佐啟發與勉勵之所不及、故主要工作、重在倡導與宣傳教化之合宜、至實施之際、必先測度每一工作效果如何、是否能如吾人所預期、然後懸的以求、悉力以赴、選擇經濟之辦法、以求簡單迅速與確實、力避官樣文章與繁重之手續、運用旣成之組織自然之方式、因勢利導、以免擾民耗時與妨害事業、茲將其實施方面、分為實施之主體、實施之步驟、實施之方法、與實施之事項、分別敘述、</p>

<p>一九三五年、義大利進攻阿比西尼亞、加以佔領、一九三六年、德義兩國開始武力干涉西班牙、德國在西班牙北部及西屬摩洛哥建立統治、義大利則在南部及巴列牙群島、一九三七年、日本於佔領滿洲之後、進而侵入華北及華中、佔據北平·天津·上海·並開始將各國之競爭者、擠出佔領區外、一九三八年初、德國佔領奧大利、秋聞、又奪去捷克之蘇臺德省、同年底、日本占領廣州、一九三九年初、更佔海南島、如此逐漸蔓延之戰爭、已漸將五萬萬以上之人口、引入其圈內、延及由天津·上海·及廣州經過阿比西尼亞至直布羅陀海峽之廣大土地、「第一次帝國主義大戰後、各戰勝國、主要為英未能美三國、曾建立一種新國際關系體系、即戰後和平體系、此體系之主要支柱為遠東之九國公約、歐洲之凡爾賽和約、用其他數條約、在此體系中、國際聯盟當以各國之聯合陣線、集體保障國家安全之原則為基礎、調整各國間之關係、但在個侵略國家及所掀起帝國主義大戰、已將此戰後和平體系全部推翻、日本已撕碎九國公約、德義則毀裂凡爾賽和約、為自由行動起見、彼等又退出國際聯盟、於是新帝國主義戰爭仍成事實、</p>
<p>一時至今日、不顧任何條約、不問與讑、突然加入戰爭原非易事、此點資產階級政客固深知之、法西斯首領等亦然、因此、彼法西斯首領等乃於掀起戰爭之前、設法鼓動與論、欺騙之、引之入歧途、以便達到自己目的、</p>
<p>「彼等若曰、德義軍事集團敵對英法兩國在歐洲之利益乎、安有此事、「吾人」豈有任何軍事集團、「吾人」所有惟無害之「柏林羅馬軸心、」不過係某種關於軸心之幾何學公式、（大笑）、德義日軍事集團敵對美英法三國在遠東之利益乎、安有此事、「吾人」絕無軍事集團、僅有無害之「柏林羅馬東京三角」、關於幾何學傾斜之問題耳、（全場大笑）、進攻英法美三國利益之戰爭乎、絕無此理、「吾人」僅從事反共產國際戰爭、絕無此理、「吾人」僅從事反共產國際戰爭、絕無敵視上述各國之意、君如不信、可閱德義日三國締結之「共產國際公約」、</p>
<p>「侵略國諸公欺騙與論時其所思所言即如上述、此種偽裝之笨拙無聊、自極易察破、緣於蒙古之戈壁、阿比西尼亞之山嶺、西屬摩洛哥之荒原中、尋覓共產國際之「中心」、」此不問而可知其荒謬絕倫、（大笑）夫戰爭乃强項固執之物、絕不能藏於幃後、任何「軸心」「三角」及「反共產國際公約」、絕不能掩飾下列事實、即在時期中、日本已攫取中國大遍土地、義大利已攫取阿比西尼亞、德國又攫取奧大利及蘇臺德省、德義兩國聯合已攫取西班牙、而心此一切均屬違反不侵略國家之利益、戰爭終為戰爭、侵略國軍事集團終為軍事集才、侵略國終為侵略國、</p>
<p>「新帝國主義戰爭的特質、在於此戰爭尚未普遍化、侵略國的戰爭、侵犯非侵略國如英如法如美的權益、而後者則步步退讓、公開的世界再分割的行動、劃分勢力範圍的行動、正在進行、以打擊非侵略國的利益、而後者則不但不加以抵拒、反而有縱容之情形、可謂怪事、然亦為事實、」</p>
<p>「新帝國主義戰爭之此種奇異特殊現象、將如何加以解釋、非侵略國家原具有一切能力、而竟毫無抵預收棄具原來地們、以圖取悅於侵略國、此種情勢何以可能、是否因非侵略國國力不足所致、當然不是、非侵略國家集合的力量、毫無疑義的遠超於侵略國、無論經濟軍事皆然、既如此、則彼等對侵略國之有系統的讓步、究應如何解釋、方為適當、彼等或因畏懼大戰爆發播於全球、自身被擲入漩渦後、將列發革命運動、資產階級政治家已知第一次世界大戰造成世界上、最大國家之一的革命勝利、他們甚恐二次大戰將使革命在其他國家中爆發而成功、</p>
<p>「可是在目前、以上解釋並非唯一的且不是主要的理由、主要理由乃因非侵略國家、尤以英法為最、已放棄其集體安全政策、而採取不干涉主義及中立主義、形式上言之、不干涉主義可作如下解釋、「聽由各國努力自保、以抗拒侵略、我輩不必過問、我輩不妨與侵略國及被侵略國同時進行貿易、」事實上則不干涉主義等於縱容侵略、鼓勵戰爭、因此、即等於改變侵略為世界大戰、不干涉主義政策包含容許侵略之願望、不欲阻止侵略國强盜行為、不欲阻止日本對華作戰、或更好對　聯作戰、不欲防止德國製造歐洲事件、對蘇聯作戰、聽憑交戰國沉入戰爭之泥淖中、鼓勵彼等向此路進行、聽憑其耗竭自身力量、俟其耗竭之後、乃以全力出而干涉、「維護和平」、而對已經耗竭之交戰國、隨意支配、獲利既多、又復省力、（未完）</p>

<p>（紐約）各全能國他日與各民治國作戰進、美國須當以具體方式、援助各國一層、日益為美國與論所贊同、此可於民意研究院測騐民意結果覘之、該院會經提出問題數項、其為「歐洲若果發生戰事、吾國應否以糧食售予英法兩國」、所有答案、屬於肯定者、佔全數百分之七十六、其二為「歐洲發生戰事時、吾國應否以軍械售予英法兩國」、所有答案、屬於肯定者佔百分之五十二、其三為「吾國應否派遣海陸軍援助各治國」、所有答案屬於否定者、佔百分之八十三、但主張援助各全能國者、僅佔百分之一、按美國人在慕尼黑協定成立之前半月、不願以軍械售予各民治國者、原佔有絕大多數、茲則贊成之人反佔多數、於以見羅斯福總統現行政策已為大部份人民所擁護矣（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>造就飛機人材　遠東航校設備完善　飛行科男女兼收不限國籍　畢業後可領得英機師執照</h3>
<p>本報香港特訊，在飛行時代的今日，軍事的國防上固然需要空防的建設，經濟的國防上也需要航空交勇的發展，中國目下在抗戰時期中，軍事空防，當局正在迎頭趕上的建設中，後期的抗戰，已在開始，未來的勝得，日益迫近，在不久的將來，新興的中國，是需要解除交通運輸的困難，更需要和世界各國實業界取得密切聯繫、就目下說：中英帝航公司汎美航空公司的國際航空綫路，巳經和中國通航，歐美交通，瞬息千里，航空業務，將來在交通運輸上自然是關係上十分重大，中國的企業家今後要在國際商業上爭得一席地，自然再不容不預為綢繆，對於航空界人材的培植，正該在這個時候，從事訓練，中國的青年，也應該投身到這個前途無量的事業中。記者昨在香港參觀遠東唯一設備完全之遠東航空學校，獲悉該校種種狀況，頗足為中國航空事業上作參考，足為有志青年的一種研討，爰誌其情形如次：</p>
<p>中英合作　該校校址，在香港啟德飛機場，佔地約一百五十英畝，位於香港九龍間之海灣昆連處，蓋一極佳之水上飛機根據地。該航空學校成立於一九三四年春季，其主旨在予遠東人士以航空術之訓練，並且規定此種訓練與英國皇家空軍飛行中及機械員所受者相同，俱有考取英國政府所發給航空執照之機會。至所招的學生，不分國籍，該校和中國國民政府，英國航空部，香港政府，帝國航空公司（遠東）都訂有合約，為一有限公司之組織。</p>
<p>設備完善　該校董呈為鄧遜，司密士，摩理遜，史默斯四氏，飛行科主任為美國皇家空軍軍官史默斯少校，機械科主任為皇家空軍英國航空機械學會之尼路氏，該校課程的訓練，以地上訓練為最主要，設有課室和部點修工作，都在校內實施，故學員可親見所乘坐飛機之發動及各部裝合，為一般航空訓練者不易得天之訓練。</p>
<p>入學資格　入學的手續，年齡規定在十七歲以上，會受相當普通教育，放機械科者，由機械科主任口試，如無相當學論者，須在第一學期同時補習初級算學。放飛行科者，隨時可以報名入學。先檢騐體格，女生亦兼收。學中如無充分英語學識，亦可用華語應考，該校聘有華籍助理及傳譯員，代為翻譯，上課時並幫助講課，凡稍通英語者，俱不難領會，萬一飛行學員中有不精通英語者，可在飛行完畢後，由華籍助理，重行解釋。</p>
<p>上課辦法　機械科每年分正月至三月·四月到六月·七月至九月·十月至十二月四學期，通常上課時為上午八時至下午一時，飛行科上課時間，由星期一至星期五每日上午九時至十二時半，下午二時至五時，星期上午九時至十二時半，由該校一飛行時間，學員亦可同時學習兩科，凡學員入校必須謹守校規，尤其飛行命令，必須加意遵守。</p>
<p>飛行訓練　該校訓練時，甲·飛行科，第一科為備領取英國私用機師甲種執照者，規定初級高級變人教練十二小時，單獨飛行三小時，第二科初級軍事飛行科，訓練期間為四個月至六個月，其訓練完全與英國空軍相同，其教授程序，為乘客飛行，滑走術，及運用飛機方法，平直飛行，逆風起飛，中轉灣，翔降轉灣，急斜轉灣，初高級迫降，遇火患時動作，特技飛行，載客試騐，盲目飛行等二十七項，第三科盲目飛行科，第四科輕便飛機飛行教師科，第五科中級機及特技飛行飛機之教師科、第六科高級特技飛行術，第七科（凖備投考英國乙種機師執照）第七科甲、商用機師兼機械全科、</p>
<p>機械學習　乙·機械科，第八科第九科飛機機械科，學習時間較長，約為兩年，第一學期實習初級木材建造三個月，第二學期實習實級金屬建造三個月，第三學期實習高級木材建造三個月，第四學期實習高級金屬建造三個月，第五學期第六兩學期實習內燃機半年，第七學期實習機架保管法三個月，第十科為降落傘之處理，第十一科為高壓力飛機　烘氣銀合。</p>
<p>等於留學　如能將飛行科或機械科各科修業完畢，自與鉅資出洋向英設入航空學校效力相同，而且其學力殆與英國空軍人員相等，該校對於學員畢業領得執照後，並盡力使其得有職業出路，其學費甲飛行科，第一科港幣（以下均以港幣計算）七百五十元，第一科四千二百六十元，第三科六百元，第四科五百元，第五科九百元，第六科六百元，第七科七千元，第七科甲九千八百元，乙·機械科第八科，每月一百元，第九科每月一百元，第十科二百元，第十一科三百五十元，如有匯率變動，則臨時核算確定云。</p>

<h3>戰時上海金融市塲</h3>
<p>— 朱博泉</p>
<p>戰時之上海金融，本刊屢有論者發表，現承朱博泉先生又賜鴻文，朱先生在國内金融界之地位，想爲讀者所素　，　以業中人之眼光，觀察戰時上海金融市塲之動態，自較一般人更爲深刻，詳盡猶在其次，故不嫌重複，亟爲發表，希讀者注意。　編者</p>
<p>一　前言</p>
<p>上海爲我國通簡巨埠，握全國金融樞紐。據各方統計，一九三七年六月底止上海之銀行。占全國銀行總數百分之三二以上，（分支行不計在内）其中四十一家會員銀行之實收資本，占全國銀行實收资本總額百分之四五，資產總額，占全國百分之四四·五，各種存款，且占全國銀行存款百分之七六左右，而中央銀行及其他非會員銀行，尚不在內。此外尚有外商銀行，錢莊，信托公司，銀公司，儲蓄會等金融組織，而外商銀行及錢莊在上海金融市塲中，尤有久遠之歷史，深厚之勢力，與華商銀行成鼎足之勢。</p>
<p>近數年來，滬市金融界，飽經憂患，故力圖改進，如一二八滬變之後，上海銀錢業先後有聯合準備會之組織，其後銀行業復成立票據交換所及票據承兌所，團結日堅，實力益充。一九三五年十一月改革幣制，集中全國經濟命脈之白銀，統一發行，金融基礎，更臻穩定。此種成就，在中日戰事發生之前，早已發揮其效能，而在戰事期中，尤可充分證明其價值。</p>
<p>二開戰前後之金融市塲</p>
<p>一九三七年上半年國內一般經濟情形，均呈蓬勃氣象，自一九三五年幣制改革後，一般物價即開始上升，工商業受物價上漲刺激，莫不欣欣向榮，各市塲交易頻繁，殆爲近數年來所罕見，一九三七年上半年上海銀行票據交換總額，較上年同時約增六分之一，金融狀况，亦極安定。市塲拆息，恒盤旋於一角左右。外滙市况，始終受政府銀行控制，穩定異常。公債行市，六月間高達八十九元以上。金融業存放業務，亦一致遞增。不意　溝橋事件爆發，市塲震撼，上海虹橋飛機塲事件繼之以起，中日全面戰爭，於焉展開。</p>
<p>白蘆溝橋事件爆發後，首受影響者，即爲上海之金融界。公債市况，自七月七日以後，即急劇下降，交易所一日停拍數次，幾爲常事，迄至七月份交割時期，政府規定最低價以七十元爲限。始告平靖。斯時一般懷疑法幣者，已紛紛提取存款，購買外匯或轉存外商銀行，資金逃避，爲數甚鉅。八月初旬，滬局愈趨嚴重，提存之風，其勢益甚。迨八一三滬戰爆發，上海頓成戰區，人心恐慌，無法抑制。各交易所首先停市，銀錢業亦奉命於八月十三日起停業四天。財政部爲維持金融計，特公布安定金融辦法，限制提存，同時復由銀錢　擬訂補充辦法，就交換制度，加以利用，釐定票據匯劃方法，金融恐慌，始得减免。八月十七日起，銀錢業一律復業，一時要求提取存款者，雖仍紛至沓來，但以定有限度，且因中中交農四行貼放會及銀行業聯合準備會已有調劑同業辦法，故能應付裕如，人心亦趨安定，至年終各行莊之存戶，頗有將以前提出之款重行存入者，蓋依財政部安定金融辦法，凡於戰後以法幣交付銀行錢莊續存或聞立新戶者，得隨時照數支取法幣，不加限制，同時復困戰前活期存款，在提存限額之外，儘得以同業匯劃票流通，因此各行存款數額，不致大量减少。至當時市塲情形，一般均呈通貨緊縮之象，信用停滞，如以交易阻梗，各地與上海之商業往來瀕於斷絕，工商各業，幾均陷於停頓狀態。且因貨物來源阻塞，物惯飛漲，尤以燃料糧食等必　品爲最甚。惟當時政府對於外匯價格，始終維持，所以鞏固法幣信用者，實非淺鮮。</p>
<p>三戰時金融市塲之演變</p>
<p>戰事發生以來，上海之各種金融狀熊，大率随環境而變嚴，且彼此均有連帶關係，或互爲因果，如欲加以分析，實非易事。爲便於叙述起見，試就年餘來金融市塲之　要演變，分述於下：</p>
<p>（一）同業滙劃與貼水掉現　戰前上海銀錢業之支付工具，除法幣現鈔外，計有兩種票據，一爲劃頭票據，當日可以取現，與現鈔無異，一爲滙劃票據，隔日方能取現。安定金融辦法，規定凡戰前所存三百元以上之后期存款，每星期提款，以存款餘額百分之五爲限，至多不得超過一百五十元，同時復由上海銀錢業呈准財政部規定：「各行莊活期存款除遵照部定辦法支付法幣外，其在商業部往來，因商業上之需要，得於部定限止外，以同業滙劃票據付給之。」此種同業滙劃票據，祇准在上海同業之間劃帳，不付法幣，並不得　購外滙，與戰前隔日取現之滙劃票據，完全不同，其目的在便利工商資金之流通，而向時避免資金之逃避。一二八滬戰時，上海錢莊所出本票，亦曾一度停止隔日取現，祇准同業滙劃，蓋與此次情形，大同小異。按上海工商交易，在平時皆係轉帳劃付，以法幣支付者，木屬少數，戰後滙劃票據祇准同業轉帳，不得付現，對於商業上之需要，本無　何影響。惟上海一部分外商銀行，因與華商銀錢業素無往來，間有不願收受此種票據者；而一般進口洋商，因其布能轉購外滙，漸存歧視，更有缺少珐幣頭寸之家。爲便於使用起見，往往願以滙劃票據百元作現款九十八九元掉換現鈔，遂開滙劃掉現貼水之端。一般投機商人見有利可圖，爭以掉現爲業；於是滙劃票據，遂成買賣對象。其初每千元貼水，約在四五元至二一十元上下，其後市面之滙劃票據流通日多，而貼水掉現者亦愈衆；加以租界人口驟增，生活所需均須法幣現鈔，又因外滙統制後，黑市塲交易活躍，影響所及，貼水慮機長增高，至上年六月份，每千元貼水一度曾高達七十餘元。嗣經銀行業聯合準備曾出而維持，大量調劑，始將貼水穩定於五十元左右。上年十一月間，廣州武漢相繼失守，人心不安，又多以滙劃票據掉换現鈔，轉購外滙或現金者，貼水率復曾高漲至六十元以上，不久戰局穩定，亦即回至四十五元左右。本年一月間，經銀行業聯合準備會每日公布買進及賣出行市，正式加以管理後，貼水率已穩定每千元三十五元左右，每日僅有數角之上落。本年三月初，因受外滙及現金市況之影響，同時華北復有擾亂幣制之說，準俯會公布之貼現率，提高至每千元四十元，不久又升至五十元，目下市面貼現率仍在四十八元左右。</p>
<p>（二）同業貼放與利率　一九三五年幣制改革之後，政府原有將中央銀行改組爲中央準備銀行之計劃，籌備未成熟而滬戰已起，財政部除限制提存外，故復令中央中國交通中國農民等四家政府銀行，就各重要都市，組織聯合辦事處及聯合貼放會，以便統一事　，共負調劑金融之職責。上海四行貼放會專辦同業抵押放款从商業票據之貼現，以貼放劃頭款項爲主。至同業滙劃款項之貼放，則由四行貼放會委託銀行業聯合準備會與該會原有各項拆放合併辦理。前年九月底止，貼放會之放款，共約一千八百餘萬元，銀行業聯合準備會所放同業滙劃款項亦達一千萬元左右。戰後銀錢業爲準備提存，需款甚殷，得斯接濟，乃能應付裕如。據上年六月底之統計，四行貼放會各地貼放數額，總計五千餘萬元，至上年年底爲止，四行貼放在外之款，據財部發言人談，總計已達八千九百萬元，其中在上海貼放者，約一千六百餘萬元，占總數百分之二十左右，較前年九月間已减少。一百萬元。上海銀行業聯合準　合同業滙劃拆放數額。至上年底爲止，計五百餘萬元，較前年九月間减少五百萬元左右。</p>
<p>上海金融市塲之拆息，向有二種，一爲錢業公會之拆息，係錢莊同業間拆款之利率。一爲銀行業聯合準備會之拆息及貼現率，係銀行同業問拆款貼現之利率。自四行貼放會成立後，每日亦公布拆息及貼現率，上海金融市塲，乃有三種不同之利率。</p>
<p>錢業公會之拆息，在前年六七兩月，均爲每干元日息一角一分，八月初旬，因滬局形勢轉緊，每日遞升，至十三日高達一角九分，十七日銀錢業開市後，遂站定二角。十一月與十二月降爲一角五分，上年一月復降至一角，以後無大上落。十月一度升至一角四分，旋即回平。目下盤旋於一角二分左右。</p>
<p>銀行業聯合準備會之拆息與貼現率，分匯劃，國幣二種。前年七月份應劃及國幣拆息，均爲每千元日息一角一分，貼现率爲一角二分。八月十三日滬戰發生後，國幣拆息及貼現率高全三角，滙劃亦達二角，十月十一月匯劃拆息及貼現率降爲一角八分，十二月復升至二角，上年八月初，國幣之拆息與貼現率，更降至二角五分，迄今並無變動。</p>
<p>貼放會前年八月份所開貼現率爲週息八厘，放款息爲每千元日息三角，上年八月起，貼現率改爲週息七厘半，放款息改爲每千元每日二角半，與銀行業聯合準備會所開利率相等。</p>
<p>觀銀錢業拆息之　動，可知滬市金融情勢，已由緊張而漸趨寬弛。惟上述錢業拆息，戰後似較銀行拆息爲低，相差幾達一半，推原其故，實因匯劃本爲錢業之記賬本位，各銀行所有之匯劃頭寸，向來集中於錢業，而錢業對於同業存息，係照拆息計算，若拆息增高，則錢莊對於同業存放之滙劃存息，自須隨之增高，無異增加錢莊之負　，且戰後滙劃票據，不得付現，錢莊之滙劃頭寸，較前寬裕，更不願抬高拆息，目加負擔，實則錢莊對外放款，照坐盤加每月平均拆息，共利率亦須月息八厘左右，（如今年二月份錢業拆息月差三元加坐盤四元半爲七元半即月息七厘半）與銀行放貸利率，不相上下也。</p>
<p>（三）法幣之發行額　自幣制改革後，全國通貨之發行權，專屬於中中交農四行，各行之發行準備，亦集中於統一管理之下。經此空前改革，金融基礎，益臻健全，故前年戰事爆發後，人心雖極度恐慌，而貨幣方面，得以毫無問題。</p>
<p>當戰事發生之初，一般人十鑒於歐戰之往事，頗有以通貨膨脹爲慮者，然就戰後發行準備管理委員會歷次檢查報告之數字加以觀察，發行總額，雖有遞均，然與戰事前後比較，似尚無通貨膨脹之現象。據該會之檢查報告，一九三七年終發行總額爲一，六三九，〇九八，〇〇〇元，一九三八年六月底增至一，七二六，九九八，〇〇〇元，其增加率，實不及改革初期之速。蓋自一九三五年十二月至一九三六年十二月，法幣發行額共增五萬六千八百萬元，自一九三六年十二月至一九三七年十二月，共增三萬七千九百萬元，而一九三八年上半年則僅增加八千七百餘萬元。一九三八年六月以後之發生數字，該會未有正式公布，目前無從統計。</p>
<p>至於滬市法幣流通數量與其流通之速度，一般觀察，更無顯著增加。反限制提存後，一部份通貨，變爲封鎖賬目，加以工商停滯，通貨之流通速度且在大减。</p>
<p>（四）外滙統制與外滙暗市　我國對外匯價，在幣制改革前，向任其自然上落，幣制改革後，外滙買賣由國家銀行集中管理，對外匯價，始臻穩定。戰事爆發之初，國內資金，曾一度發生逃避，當時論者，　以統制外滙爲戰時必要之措置；惟政府當局，以我國環境特殊，尚不願貿然處置。至上年三月初，華北設立所謂「聯合準備銀行」發行不兌現紙幣，圖掉换法幣，套取外匯；政府爲防範計，乃不得不於上年三月十四日，公布外滙請核規則，規定各銀行因正當用途，於收付相抵後，需用外匯時，得向中央銀行申請購買，經中央銀行核准後，按照法定匯價售與外滙，其無正當用途或不必要之貨物進口，則不得申請購買。七年六月聞復絡續規定限制進口貨物之總類，並規定各銀行在申請外匯時，應提供同額法幣現款，以防故意逾額申請之弊。同時爲增加外匯基金起見，對於出口貿易之外匯，亦由國家銀行集中管理。凡商人運貨出口所得外匯貨價，亦應售與國家銀行。上年八月八日起，又規定凡上年一月一日以後装運入口之進口貨申請外匯，中央銀行不再接受，但對於必需品之進口，仍酌量予以供給，至是外匯統制益臻嚴密。</p>
<p>在外匯統制以前，上海外匯行市，概照中央銀行公布之滙價爲標準，各洋商銀行亦均遵守紳士協定，照中央銀行掛牌，自實行統制後，此項紳士協定，無形取消，同時一般進口商人因不能向中央銀行如數購到外滙，不得不在中央銀行以外以高價收買，以應其需要，復以租界人士之善於杞憂者，爲個人財產之一種保險計，紛紛購買外匯，故中央銀行對於核准之外滙，雖仍照原定滙價供給，而上海市上之外滙暗市，巳遠較法定匯率爲昂。</p>
<p>外滙暗市之存在，於滬市貿易金融均有不良之影響，補救辦法，實有賴於外商銀行及各友邦之合作，最近中英一千萬鎊新借款成立，並指定充平衡法幣外滙之用。是以穩定我國外滙之國際條件，業已確保，今後惟盼國人厲行節約，少購舶來品，勿圖私利，勿作投機，使外滙去落不致增加，叫暗市不特可日漸穩定，且不難達根本消滅之目的。</p>
<p>（五）公債之暗盤交易，公債市塲，在上海金融機構中，亦占重要地位，銀錢業對於公債買賣，不但視爲可靠之投資，同時亦可用爲調節資金之方法，游資多時，購储公債，缺時即　之市塲，具有第二重營業準備之性質。國內公債，過去有三十餘種之多，經一九三六年之整理，巳歸併爲一種年息六厘之統一公債，分甲乙丙丁戊五種發行，又爲平衡國庫收支，復興經濟起見，發行復興公債一種，此項公債，在市塲並無交易。經此整理後，財政基礎，益臻健全，債信轉形穩固，價格日漸提高。一九三七年六月，各債行市，最高曾達八十九元左右，自戰事爆發後，形勢乃突變。</p>
<p>在前年七月初旬蘆　爆發以後，滬上公債市况，即呈急劇下降之勢，交易所一日停拍數次，幾爲常事，卒由財政邻限制統一公債最低價爲七十元，始告平靖。滬戰爆發，上海華南證券交易所暫停營業，惟塲外交易，依然活動，每日成交數自一二十萬元增至六七十萬元，其後，逐漸成爲半公開之市塲。最初暗盤市價，在四十元左右，上年一月底，政府爲免除資金逃避起見，對於統一公債之還本付息，改付同業滙劃款項，暗盤行市，跌進四十元以內，二月份最低價曾達三十七元之新紀錄。自三月至六月，最低價爲四十元，最高爲六十元。迨七月底到期公債本息，仍由政府照付　幣，暗盤行市，始穩定於五十四五元左右。九月底歐局緊張，全世界證券跌價，上海亦未能免此，各債每日有數角上落，和平消息傳出後，始復舊觀。嗣後因外滙行市穩定，套買外滙無利可圖，一部份游資逐　赴公債市塲，各債市價，一致上升，至今年一月間，統甲公債，創見六十三元之高價。惟本年初，財部以我國自失大宗關稅，以關稅擔保之債務，由政府墊付之款，已累積至一萬七千五百萬元之鉅，故特宣佈對於戰前各長期債務，今後不再墊付，消息傳來，公債市塲，乃引起軒然大波，一日間多者跌至六元有餘。後政府公布對於一月底到期內債本息仍舊償付法幣，惟改在重慶付款，上海方面，可向中中交三行六期領取，於六個月內付清，於是人心稍定，債市回堅。最近中英新借款成立，市況更　積極，目下各債行市，若與戰前市價比較則已跌落三十元左右。戰後發行之救國公債，市價恒在三十六元左右。迄無變動。（未完）</p>

<h3>美國今日流行之經濟學説</h3>
<p>— 凡</p>
<p>據本年一月二十一日出版之倫敦Econowist雜誌所載：最近美國之經濟思想界，有四種概念，極爲流行。且其理論，頗有演成新學説之趨勢，兹摘譯其要旨介紹如次：</p>
<p>購買力之補償説　此説與「過剩蓄積論」，特别是「由增加歳入以再分配國民之所得」的租税論，密切相關。彼等以爲購買力存在時，始有需要之存在；需要存在，乃可刺激生産之增加。故與其謂爲「購買力係生産之結果，」「毋寗謂爲，生産之可能性，在於需要之刺激力；即在於購買力之存在。」彼等以爲昨年美國鐵道事業之衰落，由於工資之削减。由工資削减而造成購買力之减退，從而使景氣之恢復不易。同時又以爲提高關税，足以維持較高工資，從而可使購買力增加。此種理論，不僅在今日之美國經爲流行；即在其他各國，特别是法國之思想界，亦頗多共鳴者。唯風行之程度，不若美國爲廣耳。</p>
<p>國庫金調整國民經濟説　國庫雖貧乏，但國家得採用增加通貨之方法，或其他可以增加國民儲蓄之方法，藉以造出國民所得。移轉國庫金至民間，國庫金果將虧短，國民所得（非國民生産總值，而係各個人所得之總額）則可望增加。同樣，增加國庫金，即有增加國民所得之可能。如因堅持國家預算平衡之原則，而使國民所得，限於所謂一般的「正常」水準以下，就國民經濟之觀點言，實係失策之至。由於此種見解，故將國家財庫，視爲調整國民所得之「唧筒」；並由於國庫虧短可增大國民所得；故進而主張此種「唧筒」，必需「噴水」；並演進而爲「信用的膨脹政策」。</p>
<p>縮短工時之恢復景氣説　普通基於工人之健康觀點，而主張每週工時，不得超過四十八小時。今則爲恢復景氣之故，進而主張將每週工時，减至四十八小時之下。美國一九三三年之産業復興法中，已規定每週工作四十小時制。其後雖即廢止，但在産業界方面，對此四十小時工作制度，已成習慣者頗多而在繼續維持者。甚至復以此爲傳統權利而擁護者。因减少工時之另一面，足以增加工人之就業率，亦即提高一般之購買力，基於購買力之補償説觀之，自可恃爲恢復繁榮之一種手段也。</p>
<p>應給與老弱及失業者以最低限之生活費説　對於失業者，及年老者，應承認其有享受最低生活費之權利；即非對彼等給以購買力不可。此種理論之原則，可由其對於養老金之態度上發現之。依美國現行之養老金法，規定每月應給以三十元之政府年金。其中一半由聯邦政府支付，另一半則由地方政府負担。此外，在社會裕民法中，亦有養老年金之規定。當昨年總選中，增加養老年金額，一時成爲美國之輿論中心。且有每月即給付二百元，亦未必較二年前之實際收入爲多。此種理論，且有遍及全美之勢。咸以爲年金制度，可以增加購買力，從而可喚起一般的消費，以至於刺激生産之增加。國庫支付年金負担之增重，國庫金自易發生虧損。然此種虧損，不過「唧筒之噴水。」故此項理論，實又爲「國庫金調整國民經濟説」之延伸。亦係「購買力補償説」之延伸。</p>

<h3>蘇北華軍集中待命　向日軍作弧形包圍　沿港居民紛紛向內地疏散日圖封鎖各港口無法實現</h3>
<p>蘇北通如崇海啟五縣華軍、業已奉令進駐在長江下游之各港口、將天生港·青龍港·等處之日軍、已作弧形式之包圍、待機反攻、沿江居民、向內地疏散、日方原擬以三月十日起、封鎖各港企圖、難以實現、茲經現代社記者探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>各路華軍進駐沿港　原駐在蘇北南通·如　·崇明·海門·啟東·五縣華軍、業奉第三戰區第二十四集團軍總指揮部命令、於三月九日晚起、同時由內地向沿江挺進駐防、現自海門宋季港起、迄至如　新生港止、約一百五十餘海程距離內、華軍約有七萬至九萬人密佈、並已取得聯絡、將沿海日方軍事根據地之海門青龍港·南通天生港·如　新生港·等處之日軍、作弧形之包圍、並疊築堅强之防禦工事、及進襲日軍時之壕道、</p>
<p>港口居民疏遷內地　軍事當局、以總反攻期即將開始、因鑒於歷次日軍國殘暴行爲、飛機大砲、濫施轟炸、累及無辜民眾之生命財產、爲減少或避免此種慘痛起見、業經下令沿江各口居民迅即向內地疏遷、是故近日間各港遷移者、各處擁塞情形、已入戰事狀態、各商業亦進行結束、俾於必要時遷避、現各輪雖照常開航、但貨運方面均銳減、</p>

<h3>每月節省兩元　可救一命　遊藝廣播委會發表告各界書</h3>
<p>上海難民救濟協會市民組遊藝廣播委員會、爲籲請各界參加認養難民運動、特發表告各界書云、都市中的人們、出去玩一次、吃一次、跳一次舞、看一塲影戲、或叉一次小麻將、用去了兩塊錢、算不得一回事、可是在困苦的難民方面看來、這兩塊錢、已</p>
<p>足夠他們　維持一個月的生命了、因此本會有「每月節省兩元、可救難民一命、」的口號、籲請各界、一致參加認養難民運動、現在本市難民、爲數尚多、而且還在那裏增加着、同時維持他們生活的日期、也遠比以往發生天災人禍後、所要救濟的日期長、所以很大的一筆經費、</p>
<p>很可能的　在一個很短的時期中用去了、至於改善他們的生活、不必談了、可是我們的目的、不但要維持他們的生活、而且還要利用他們空閒的勞力、使他們在可能的範圍內、也能利用他們自己的勞力、來供給他們自己日常生活上的需要、使我市民將來的負擔、可減輕些、本組本設有播音勸募委員會、辦理廣播宣傳事宜、現在承蒙關心社會前途的遊藝界的領袖、各電台的主人、和各界慈善人士、</p>
<p>熱心贊助　參加工作、特將該委員會範圍擴大、成立遊藝廣播委員會、今後用遊藝廣播方法、向各界宣傳、請各界對難民的前途更關心、對難民的痛苦更憐恤、因此拿出更多的錢來救濟他們、務使在這最短的期內、籌募到更巨的經費、除去茍延他們的生命以外、還能購辦若干</p>
<p>生產工具　使他們漸入自給的大路、申曲中尚唱着「窮的那有窮到底、富的那有富到頭、」尤其在這痛苦的時期中、一切不可揣摩的環境、很能使生活發生很大的轉變、所以救濟難民、也可以說是爲了自己的前途、希望各界今後努力和本會合作、爲難民造福、和爲我全市民造安全、</p>
<h3>僞「軍」一批駐防滬西　游擊隊將痛勦　僞「軍」配備窳劣並無槍彈帶滬西農民畏避騷擾相率引退</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨（十一日）悉、滬西租界防區外、已有「維新政府」之僞軍調到、會同日軍在鐵路交叉點、與虹橋路·羅別根路·區域中之重要橋樑及交叉地放哨、昨晚、據華人方面聲稱、已往數月來活躍於此等區域中之游擊隊、誓將此輩僞軍殲滅云、虹橋路與哥爾夫球塲附近某地之鄉民、昨晚均已撤退、虹橋區居民、已見</p>
<p>僞軍與日哨兵　出現於鐵路交叉點、若輩似屬劣等之士兵、且配備窳劣、雖携步槍、但無槍彈帶、鐵路交叉點迤西、已有一部份僞軍替代日哨兵、常見駐有日軍兩名之某橋樑上、昨日見駐有日軍僞軍兩名、日軍僅一名、即僞警局亦由僞軍防衛、據觀察者稱、虹橋路旁某鎮似已設有僞軍總部、遍鎮均見僞軍、但未能猜測其數若干、昨日午後、突起槍聲數響、致</p>
<p>傳游擊隊攻擊　該地鄰近之僞軍、但未能證實之、據向鄉民探悉、游擊隊已宣稱將肅清僞軍、故該區中之農民、相率引退、惟至昨日深晚、鄰近未聞槍聲、亦未發生稍能證實謠傳之事件、猶憶數星期前、傳僞「維新政府」決派僞軍來滬、協助在租界上從事所謂「靜默的戰事」、已證明其虛張聲勢、蓋聞來滬者僅新在南京受訓練之</p>
<p>僞警三四十名　若輩抵滬、昨日頗引起外界揣測、又據大陸報云、據昨日（十一日）本埠日文大陸新報透露、日方擬成立僞軍三百萬名、其經費每名五角、該「軍」將由青年編成、由南京僞「維新政府」開始此運動、是項計劃之經費、爲一百五十萬元、該「軍」將致力於「三省中樹立和平與秩序、與開發新中國」</p>
<p>其迫切之目的爲遏「制赤色威脅」云、但據華人方面消息、日軍當局乃企圖利用其「補充兵」、對付邇來益趨活躍而引起日軍嚴重關切之游擊隊、又據大陸軍新報之譯文稱、今在日本之「維新學院畢業生」、將組成該「軍」之核心、此等青年、經特殊指導後、將返侵佔區內各地、俾編立提議中之「軍隊」云、</p>
<h3>美新聞記者　觀察戰局前途　本年內日不能大舉進攻皖浙蘇地帶華兵力加强—太湖區駐軍有重要性—</h3>
<p>大陸報云、美國新聞記者貝爾登、游歷華中華南、甫返上海據稱、中國陸軍軍官之一般見解、以爲日軍非至明年、不致復行大舉進攻、彼等雖未能決定此後日本之行動、但信今日東京方面所主要關切者、爲向英法施加壓力、而迫使中國終止抗戰、若此舉失敗、日軍或將開始侵入廣西、籍以切斷中國與外界之交通、今中國正規軍與游擊隊一百師、計</p>
<p>一百萬人　在揚子江南岸之第三·四·九戰區中嚴陣以待、但該各區中雖駐此大軍然揚子江南岸多月來無巨大之軍事行動、如日軍進侵廣西、則該省或將成爲「第二個山西」、除廣西之地勢、難以進攻外、日軍復將遇民眾之堅決抵抗、蓋廣西民眾、刻正準備應付任何不測也、爲戒備起見、該省重要公路、大都已加破壞、且於可能之地、以水</p>
<p>淹沒公路　此舉縱不能阻止日軍、亦能緩滯其前侵、該省所取之另一方法、爲將公路旁五哩內之民眾遷往他處、並充份準備於接得通知時作第二次遷移、貝氏於廣東韶關曾染微恙、不得不勾留於英國醫院中、據謂該醫院忙碌從事、治療難民與貧困之平民、皖·浙·與蘇省南部之游擊隊、與正規軍已重加組織、估計人數達十五萬人之强、不久或可見彼等</p>
<p>益趨活躍　尤以太湖區四週爲最、該區均由顧祝同將軍指揮、蓋一九三七年冬、華軍撤退時、顧氏即統一其軍隊也、今在顧氏指揮下之區域、目前雖在戰略上不關重要、但戰事進行、該區或將有更大之重要性、清代曾國藩於太平起義時、亦退入該區、重編軍隊、十年之後、復率部眾而起、予叛軍以致命之打擊、鑒於日軍之經濟與軍事根據地及僞政權所在地之南京、距該區均不遠、故該區益</p>
<p>增其重要　貝氏認顧祝同爲蔣委員長部下最幹練而效忠者之一、著名之八十七師·八十八師·與其後之三十六師、乃顧氏舊部所編成、而爲中央軍最精銳部隊之一、顧氏及其部眾退入蘇浙區後、許多軍官、均派入內地受特殊訓練半截、在此期間、彼等參加作戰練習、受戰略訓練、利用訓練地爲戰地實騐室、</p>
<p>顧氏軍隊　已有若干閒入游擊區、江蘇省之揚子江南岸、目下駐有游擊隊約十五萬人、且有新部隊加入而逐漸增强、蘇省全部游擊隊之司令、爲黃埔畢業生冷欣、不久猶任中央軍師長、今兼任其軍隊所管理區域之民政長官、冷氏曾語貝氏云、游擊隊改編已竣事、該區中之流動戰、可望有顯著之增加、渠並邀貝氏視察其管理區域、貝氏因</p>
<p>另有約會　故謝絕之、貝氏批評游擊隊局勢云、一般人以爲中國軍隊今已悉數作游擊戰、實屬錯誤、且與事實大不相符、據彼估計、渠所經過之第三戰區中一百萬士兵內、改編成游擊隊者、不出十五萬人、大多數游擊隊、均由在後方受半載特殊訓練之軍官所率領、全部游擊隊之改編、亦由此等軍官從事、故貝氏以爲游擊區內之游擊隊、將益增其活動也、</p>

<h3>日憲兵　侵入美軍防區　在邵式軍寓所前被圍經美軍官說明後退去僞員傾軋愈烈之一證</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨日午前十時三十分甫過、駐滬美國第四海軍陸戰隊武裝士兵一卡車、由軍官兩名率領、駛抵南陽路三十九號「統稅局長」邵式軍之寓所前停止、將警務處探員數名與日憲兵部便衣人員四名包圍、旋見美軍官兩名行近日人、聞係彼等說明、日人不准在美軍防區內取單獨行動、據</p>
<p>目擊者言　日人聞言後、即行離去、昨晚向美陸戰隊總部探詢、然未有所透露、叩諸其中人員、據謂渠並無可告者、即向總巡捕房與靜安寺捕房探詢亦未獲得此事之消息、此事之性質、今尚不能確知、就現象察之、警務處與日憲兵部刻正各自調查中、但日方軍官之到塲、似可表示此事必屬</p>
<p>政治性質　或半政治性質、蓋此前發生罪案、未聞有日憲兵部在公共租界內調查者、此說似可以前數星期來盛傳「維新政府」華籍僞員間、傾軋頗烈、竟至互相告發之說證實之、茍昨日之事、亦在此列、則似屬有人告發邵式軍、而日人與警務處人員同時加以調查、大致雙方即在其寓所前偶然相遇、據目擊者談、美兵到塲後、似未起</p>
<p>決裂局勢　當時美陸戰隊與日憲兵之軍官談話、亦未聞恫嚇之語調、按照常例、日方警務人員欲在公共租界內調查案件、應請警務處協助、然後照例撥探員若干、偕日人前往、但就昨日之事件判斷之、日人似未照前行辦法、按「統稅局」爲「維新政府」最重要部份之一、邵氏軍爲該局「局長、」</p>

<h3>各團體追悼　張退庵　儀式隆重備極哀榮</h3>
<p>南通已故實業家張退庵氏、客歲作古於滬上、張氏生前所經營紡織·鹽墾·教養·慈善·各事業等二十餘團體、以慨念退公遺風、特於昨日假檳榔路玉佛寺開追悼會、並舉行公祭、儀式隆重、是日風和日麗、來賓甚眾、各團體計到南通大生紡織公司·大達輪船公司·墾牧·大豐·大有晋·大豫·華成·二十餘鹽墾公司、南通學院·南通女子師範·南通中學·紡織學友會·南通各慈善團體·通如崇海啟五縣同鄉會等、名流計到陳陶遺·沈信卿·李拔可·吳蘊齋·李耆卿·徐靜仁·王丹揆·等來賓共計千餘人、躋躋蹌蹌、盛況空前、一時檳榔路上、素車白馬、銜接不絕、尤以各名彥致送輓聯詞章、琳瑯滿目、備極哀榮、自上午十時起、至下午三時止、各團體領袖以次舉行公祭、佈置方面、大門口高懸「南通張退庵先生追悼會」匾額、中廳懸退公遺容、自正廳以至寺門走廊等處、遍懸各名流彥碩之祭幛輓聯、不下千餘副、如朱慶瀾氏聯云、「數實業大家、瑚璉賢名傳衛賜、吊平生摯友、江淮高節慕田疇」、韓國鈞氏聯云、「爲實業界開新紀元、獨至高年飽憂患、於劇亂時得大解脫、幸看後起已騰驤」、哲嗣敬禮、並迭接重慶方面孔院長·張部長·等各要人唁電數十通、足見張氏生前從事實業、深爲國人所崇仰也、</p>
<h3>美海軍當局　向工部局提抗議　對允許日方在租界檢查恐怖份子而發</h3>
<p>本報特訊、美海軍當局以工部局與日方成立協定、准日軍在公共租界內於巡捕在塲之時、檢查「恐怖份子」嫌疑犯藏匿之權、影響美軍防區之權限、特於日前向工部局提出抗議、</p>
<h3>米業穩定市價　組評價委員會　市塲管理方法似欠周密米糧根本未至嚴重時期要在取締投機操縱囤積</h3>
<p>上海米市塲、受日僞直接向產區收買影響、以致價格飛漲、自經公會規定限價後、暗盤竟逾越限價、荳米·米號·碾米·經售·等米業公會、及南幫公所·常熟公所·等、定今日下午二時、舉行聯席會議、集議穩定市價辦法、決組織評價委員會、取締囤積居奇、投機操縱、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>米業派員陳述一切　荳米業公會、除函公共租界工部局法租界公董局、請爲未雨綢繆計、速妥籌善策外、並於前晨推派委員陳子彝·朱子香·符前耕、會同米號業公會主席張念萱、向兩租界當局陳述一切、由何德奎等接見、彼此交換穩定米價意見、聞租界當局認爲訂購洋米未到其時、應先設法疏通來源、務使滬市民食、不致發生缺乏恐慌、</p>
<p>聯席會議穩定米價　市塲管理委員會除勸告各地販商、恢復販運外、並邀集各行號維持限價、今因市塲次號各米、均已漲至限價、而一般囤戶、不允限價出售、販商因成本關係、不敢大量販運、以致暗盤交易、頭號白米漲至十五元、荳米業公會以米價暗盤逾越限價、事關滬市民食甚鉅、故已定今日下午二時、召集米號·碾米Ｚ·經營·等公會、及南幫常熟公所、集議穩定辦法、</p>
<p>决定組織評價委會　據米業團體消息、依照政府頒佈之非常時期糧食調節辦法規定、「各地方糧食價格、如因奸民投機操縱、致發生不正常漲落情事、應由地方政府或糧食調節機關、施行適當處置、予以制止、並得在糧食重要市塲、斟酌實際情形、妥慎規定糧食最高或最低價格、以防止操縱、故決組織評價委員會、評定米價、委員人選、俟今日聯席會議中推定之、將來每週或每日先評定米價、然後由市塲公布行市交易、並擬於行客在交易之前、須採用成交單、以避免囤戶或空頭掮客、從中播動、影響行市、」</p>
<p>工部局將開會討論　租界當局、鑒於連日滬市米價飛漲、平民生計攸關、除督責米業團體、妥爲穩定市價、並監視交易市塲情況、設法制止外、爲調節今後滬市民食、將於本星期內、由工部局召集董事會例會時、提出討論後、再交食糧聯席會管理會、負責規劃一切、</p>
<p>取締投機操縱囤積　上海荳米市塲米價暗盤、已逾越每石十四元之限價、其主因雖爲受日僞直接向產區鉅量採辦之影響、致內地米價抬高、販商因成本關係、不敢大量販運、但難免不有囤戶居奇、投機操縱情事、今決派員澈查有無奸商壟斷操縱情事、依照政府頒佈之戰時農礦工商管理條例第十五條第二款之規定辦理、並請兩租界當局予以充分之協助、</p>
<p>提議訂購預防缺乏　政府規定如糧食缺乏、認爲有免稅或減稅運進洋米、以資調劑之必要時、應呈請財政經濟兩部、轉呈行政院核准後購運之、今各米業團體、鑒於目前滬市倖存底充足、暫時不致缺乏恐慌、將來青黃不接之際、難免有缺乏之虞、故希望兩租界當局、仿照二十六年冬季辦法、訂購洋米、分批運滬、交米業團體辦理平　、並請政府特准免稅進口、並供給外滙、</p>
<p>民食未至嚴重時期　昨據米業巨子張念萱語現代社記者云、近日滬市米價飛漲、各方頗多煩言、溯其原因、不在於內地米糧之來源、與滬上儲存之多寡、實歸咎於市塲運用管理方法、似欠週密所致、照目前滬地存數計之、足敷三四個月之民食、根本未至嚴重時期、即以後論、亦無匱乏恐慌之憂慮、據個人意見、（一）疏通來源、（二）評定市價、（三）同業應得之利益、循此三項原則進行、則囤戶方面、亦無從施其技、而米價亦可趨平穩、</p>
<h3>滬甬輪公益費　照淨貨噸繳納　煤艙水艙噸位不在計算之內</h3>
<p>行駛滬甬綫之德平·謀福·棠賽·山泰·新北京·等輪、昨函航業公會、轉電浙省府暨財政廳云、查輪船繳納進口公益費、照章應依輪船淨貨噸計算、當時德平等輪、誤將煤艙水艙所佔噸位、亦一並報到在內、茲將該船各部所佔噸位、繕具明細噸額、表附呈請准予改正、依照輪船貨淨噸繳納、以輕負担、</p>
<h3>公敎進行會昨　祈禱教皇康寗　恭行求主彌撒教徒均往參加</h3>
<p>天主教羅馬教皇庇護第十一世薨逝後、紅衣主教大會、業已選舉國務卿柏牙利紅衣主教、升任教皇、爲庇護第十二世、本市公教進行會、爲宣揚天主教唯一組織、該會陸隱耕朱子堯等、日前業已致電羅馬祝賀、幷爲表示祝賀起見、特於昨日清晨七時三十分、在霞飛路聖心堂、恭行求主彌撒、賜祝新教皇聖躬康泰、由徐宗鐸指導司鐸、該會各教友均遵時前往參情況至爲熱烈、</p>
<h3>僞『市長』傅筱庵　向工部局要求　提出多款儼如夢囈</h3>

<h3>婚後真正的愛情須從健康中　鍜錬而來</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<p>有許多人雖已到了結婚的目的，但欲維持婚後的愛情於永久，確非易事，蓋兩性的結合，決不是一件小事情，實是人生的無上重要事件，若僅能顧到結婚儀式的舉行，而不能發揮夫婦生活合作的精神，終究會造成莫大的悲劇的。</p>
<p>在社會上常有許多離婚的慘劇演出，構成此種慘劇的原因雖有多端，然主要的一點，多由於愛情不能融合所致。因男女之愛，須從健康中鍜錬而來，若喪失此健康的體魂，則任憑你有優裕的生活環境，也是徒然！</p>
<p>要保持吾人的健康不因結婚生活而喪失，則第一問題，端賴婚前之善保童貞，切忌自凟，婚後尤宜節慾，庶既兩性愛情，不致用一時生殖力之缺乏而頹然自廢，但如果真有生殖力失常的話，切不可諱疾忌醫，除對於生殖的衛生格外注意外，並宜採用德國最有功效的青春腺素製劑男用「補體康」則生殖力返老還童，愛情亦久婚如新矣。</p>
<p>生殖雖爲人類天賦本能，然因性感的感受性發生病象，以至失却夫婦之樂趣者，未始無之，在醫學上名曰性機能衰弱症，如早洩，陰萎，及女性常患之不感症是也，患此實爲自身體質衰弱的症象。年過四子的人，因生理關係，生殖的熱力減退，此蓋由於主宰性力的青春腺由强轉弱之故，因一個人的性慾隨年歲的增加而逐漸消失，此不僅性慾如此，凡精神，皮膚等處均然。今既明瞭性力的健全在青春腺的繁榮，故德國性病專家梅倫博士所發明之雄壯動物青春腺內分泌製劑「補體康」，確爲二十四紀醫學結晶的偉大發明，服後腦力清爽，精神振作，面色紅潤，食慾增進，性機能非常健全，絕無早洩，陰萎等病狀，且能促進生育機能，幫助性器發育，能恢復中年人的性力補腦，補腎，補血，均其卓效，寮爲老幼滋補聖品，其女用「補體康」爲調經種子，治療貧血，乳癟的對症良藥，尤其對於婚後所生之不感症，一服本劑，頓變多情矣。</p>

<h3>白濁新治法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>淋病之不易治療，和一向無妥速根治之製劑，只要是慢性淋病患者，沒有不知道這句話的。因爲他們害了三五年淋病，服了許多藥物，都不曾得到根治，就是從前歐美各國的人，說起淋病兩字，也往往談虎色變。</p>
<p>如今因科學進步，對於淋病治療，由學者們埋頭不斷之研究，發明一種非特異性療法，以增加抗淋噬菌作用，頓形强大，因而如火如荼之淋菌的兇鋒，頓形挫抑，蓋淋病最善東逃西竄，治愈甲處，乙處又被攻入而興風作浪，故不論那一部的器官，均能竄進，如骨節，內臟深部，至於生殖與泌尿器兩大器官，更不必說了。可是如能將此種撲滅淋菌的療法，作實際之努力，則不難鏟除之。因非特異性療法能抗進撲滅淋菌之功能，德國彼德博士竭三十餘年之研究，根據此種學理，採用特製蛋體黃色素等混合製成「克淋儂」一藥，於是千古來未有人將征服之淋病，今因不得不爲「克淋儂」一藥所征服，茲試析其特點如下：（一）「克淋儂」具有抗淋殺菌作用，此作用分佈全體細胞，凡淋菌所到之處，「克淋儂」殺菌作用，無不盡量發揮。（二）「克淋儂」係純用科學方法提煉製成，絕對無不良副作用，與一般透膜殺菌，及檀香油等製劑有副作用者，大異其趣。（三）「克淋儂」因其有抗淋殺菌之功所以具有鎮痛利尿清濁之功。凡上等之功效，對於根治淋病之條件，業已完全具備。如能一方輔用「抗淋水」爲外用藥，女子以「卡而雪地陰道片」爲陰道坐藥，則凡是一切急慢性淋，無不迅速斷根</p>
<h3>爲自凟青年的前途着想</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>青年因生理的成熟，由於意志薄弱，致犯上自凟癖者，爲數頗多。講到自凟爲害的原因，因斵傷過度射精中樞過敏所致，常犯夢遺與神經衰弱，以致形容憔悴，精神頹唐，凡事消極而悲觀，雖自凟之害已使精關弛鬆，失其收束機能，釀成遺精滑精等癥狀時，患者亦往往羞見有聲望之名醫，而秘密自療。至於療法，首在診察其所以致病的原因，然後按病理療之很易治好，然均復數星期不輟之治療，及隨時攝生，而遺精等症始可痊愈。</p>
<p>要治療遺精，須先戒絕自凟，然後服以遺精專藥「耐而斯遺精片」該劑功能鞏固精關，解射精中樞的過敏狀態，如遺精已久，則兼以睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」服之，所有神經衰弱等症，即可澈底根治矣。否則此時尚再悍然不顧，不僅對於健康與幸福喪失，而對於壽命亦有莫大之影響。</p>
<h3>怎樣撲滅癆菌</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>任何人都知是肺病的預後，是可怕的，但如何能使肺病造成這樣可怖的？關於這個問題，首得要對肺病的病理，作精細之剖視，然後對此病才可有正確的認識和治療法，原來肺病是一種極渺小的結核菌作梗。他的體積，須高倍之顯微鏡，染色後才能觀察得到。而且它的繁殖力，異常的迅速，故要求肺病之根絕，宜對肺結核菌完全有搜捕而撲滅之功，而有此種功效之藥劑，惟「補肺拿爾」一藥而已，余在肺病之臨床上，業已數十寒暑，每感內服藥之缺乏，但自有「補肺拿爾」一藥發明以來，此種缺恨，業已彌補矣。</p>

<h3>淋病關節炎之速治</h3>
<p>淋毒性關節炎，本來是淋毒性全身傳染之一，此病之成因甚多，而歸根結底言之，不外淋病患者，遷延失治，餘毒內伏，復因飲酒房勞等刺戟，此狡猾淋菌，隨血液之循環，傳播全身，若淋菌稽留關節，即成爲關節炎，患者寒熱交作，關節腫大，突然劇痛，呈緊張與波動之狀態，倦怠，食慾不進，其淋毒範圍，至此日益擴大，故變幻莫測，更非一般局部手術及透膜殺菌等劑所可奏功。</p>
<p>蓋全身關節，既多有此等淋菌盤踞作祟，勢不能作一枝一節之驅除，而必須統籌全局，作根本之解決，故自非予以全身細胞皆起抗毒素而奏殺菌不可。要求此種理想的療法之實現，今已藉科學方法之研究而成功。即在理學療法上用德國X線電及靜電療法之交互施用，又血清注射方面，則德國抗淋血清亦有偉大之功效。而內服藥方面，則淋病聖藥「克淋儂」一藥，確亦不可少也。</p>
<p>因「克淋儂」一藥，係採用蛋白體黃色素等混合製劑。故服之能發生抗淋噬菌作用，凡服「克淋儂」後，於短期內體內即發生此種抗淋殺菌作用，一方助以抗淋血清，與靜電X治療，以助內服藥，使其殺菌作用，盡量發揮，而匿藏關節深部之淋菌，全部肅清，一方又獲消炎鎮痛防腐之效。故關節腫痛，如內部未化腫者，服「克淋儂」可以防止而消滅之。是又其他淋病內服藥中所不能望其項背者。而此種使人殘廢之淋毒性關節炎，無不迅獲治愈，並恢復原來之健全。毫無不良之遺留也　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號，每號僅取號金五角。</p>

<p>甬人張富昌、往歲在閘北光復路升仁煤號充送貨老司務之役時、現開恒潤煤號之吳曉卿、亦任升仁協理、吳見張服務頗勤、人復誠篤、遂存提携之念、勸勿依人作嫁、茍有志自立、彼當加以臂助、張經吳勉勵之後、如圖當發、未幾、果自創一業東煤球廠於虹口、營業</p>

<h3>小學生與難童通訊</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>這次我們為籌募難民生產教育經費，推行樂善章募捐運動，本市各小學學生，一致踴躍捐輸，使十萬難民，均有參加生產教育訓練的機會，真是利民救難，功德無量！</p>
<p>各難民收容所裏，有許多「難童」，他們聽說將來也有讀書的機會，也有做工的機會，都喜形於色，異常高興，意忘記肚皮裏飢餓的痛苦了。</p>
<p>難童在收容所裏的生活情形，小學生應該知道；小學生在學校裏的生活情形，難童也應該知道。為謀雙方互相明瞭起見，我們擬倡導小學生與難童通訊。</p>
<p>下面是小學生與難童難訊的簡單辦法：</p>
<p>一，小學生與難童，如喜歡通訊，可將姓名開交自己的老師，　印一份通訊錄，分發各難民收容所與各小學。</p>
<p>通訊錄格式如下表：</p>
<p>姓名　年歲　性別　那裏人　在什麼學校收容所　地址</p>
<p>二，各小學學生與各收容所難童，接到通訊錄，即可彼此通訊。</p>
<p>三，通訊範圍，除報告自己狀况和調查受信人生活情形外，並可約期參觀，約期舉行聯合表演，以增興趣。</p>
<h3>一個難童的感言</h3>
<p>— 懿</p>
<p>離開了家鄉已過了二個冬天了，悲傷痛苦彌滿了我的心。我的前面是黑暗，是失望，我是個世上最不幸的孩子。</p>
<p>昨天偶然上馬路走走：看見許多同我一樣大的孩子，他們攙着媽的手，手中又拿著糕呀餅呀！氣球呀……而上又露出一種　得意的神氣。使我突然想起二年前的我，不是和他們一樣嗎？快快樂樂的過新年，現在呢？他們是天之矯子，幸福的人們。我呢？是一個無父無母無家孤苦零仃的人們我的父母再能復活嗎？我的姊妹再能相聚嗎？我的家已成了瓦屑堆，我的幸福再到何處去找？世上一切的幸福，都不是我所能享受的……不，我以前的思想完全是錯誤了，我不應消極，我的新生命在未來，用自己的能力創造未來的種種。現在我的家雖被毀了，但是收容所是我現在的家，我的父母雖被殺死了，姊妹失散了；但是我同病的難胞們就是我唯一的親人，我的學校雖被燒毀，現在收容所中的教育　能增進我的智識，我們不用頹喪悲觀，用我們的全能來和環境奮鬥！</p>

<h3>難童蓆地聽講</h3>
<h3>通信運動</h3>
<p>— 舜江</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！現在我誠摯地來發起這個『通信運動』，希望大家來把它執行，推進！</p>
<p>提倡這運動的目的！</p>
<p>（一）是在使你們能與難童連絡起來，去瞭解難童的生活，和指示難童的教育。</p>
<p>（二）是在想練習你們的寫作能力。</p>
<p>（三）是在　動你們對於『節約救難』運動的熱心。</p>
<p>它的內容，大路可分兩大類：</p>
<p>（一）報告生活事實——包括個人的，家庭的，　　的生活，以及感思等等。</p>
<p>（二）互相交換　識——包括書本上和其他實際知識。</p>
<p>這一個運動，先暫定高級的小朋友們來自由參加，低級的及中級的小朋友們，要是也高興參加的話，自然也可以，不過須要有恒心的努力地去幹。</p>
<p>至於通認的辦法：</p>
<p>（一）以一個小學校與難童學校為單位，由彼此派定適當的人數。</p>
<p>（二）由難童學校閒列名單，任小朋友們選擇一個人為對象。</p>
<p>（三）通信時期，暫定二星期一次——或看各方面的需要，而隨時增减次數。</p>
<p>（四）信稿在課外寫作，最好先請給導師看過，加以改正；若是不喜歡這樣做的話，那麼也隨便。</p>
<p>（五）難童寄信的郵資，由小朋友們負責——因為難童已失去經濟的來源，沒有力量來負擔這個經濟上的重擔。</p>
<p>附帶的還希望各學校的導師與小朋友們幾點：</p>
<p>（一）希望各導演能多多的鼓勵或幫助小朋友們，多供給點材料，或臨時開會討論，使得這個運動，能很快的發展開來。</p>
<p>（二）希望小朋友們，多多的借書維難童，使他們能在課外有書閱讀。</p>
<p>（三）希望大家能隨時去作個人的或集體的拜訪，或者，舉行各種比賽，開交誼會等。</p>
<p>大衆唱詞</p>
<h3>花木蘭</h3>
<p>— 張夢飛</p>
<p>木蘭從軍的故事，原是我國古時女界中很偉大很光榮的一個，一首木蘭詩，什麼「喞喞復喞喞」，傳在民間，差不多男女盡知，現下作者演為彈詞，投入大衆週刋，給讀者們唱唱，或給各彈詞家電臺上去播播音，以便更外普及，諒必大衆所歡迎的吧。</p>
<p>（木蘭引）雄兔脚撲索，雌兔眼迷離，兩兔在地走，莫辦雄與雌。</p>
<p>（木蘭白）我乃木蘭是也，十　年代你從軍，吃下了多少艱辛，而今邊寇掃平，回歸故里，也算得一椿莫大的幸事，此刻待我到門外去見伙伴者。</p>
<p>（唱）木蘭是孝心一點去從軍，</p>
<p>為國　勞受苦辛，</p>
<p>女扮男裝誰識得，</p>
<p>此時邊寇已征平。</p>
<p>功成歸里心歡喜，</p>
<p>重作閨中一娉婷，</p>
<p>脫去戰時袍一襲，</p>
<p>舊時衣服又穿身，</p>
<p>青絲挽就時新髻，</p>
<p>一朶花兒插髪雲，</p>
<p>柳葉眉兒分八字，</p>
<p>秋波黑白見分明，</p>
<p>瑤鼻，</p>
<p>紅嘴唇，</p>
<p>果然嫵媚更輕盈，</p>
<p>濃裝艷抹美人樣，</p>
<p>不若軍中殺氣生，</p>
<p>出門特地尋陪侶，</p>
<p>那知道伙伴登時膽戰驚。</p>
<p>（伙伴甲）啊喲！我的哥，快快來看呀，裏首出來的可是花將軍麼？</p>
<p>（伙伴乙）面貌一些兒不差，不過身上穿了女子的服裝，祇怕不對吧！難道是花將軍的姊妹不成？</p>
<p>（木蘭白）衆位請了，我真是木蘭，</p>
<p>（伙伴們作驚慌狀）啊喲啊喲！你是花將軍，怎麼如此裝束起來？花將軍呀，</p>
<p>（伙伴唱）我們是此番一起去從軍，同食同眠十二春，好比同胞相彷彿，未曉將軍是女身，倘然知曉你女流輩，一定要勸阻郷家不入放行，自古女兒家裏宿，拋頭露面不該應，况且是千里從軍非易事，女兒家何必去長征，吃盡千辛與萬苦，問問你到底卿家什麼心？豈非苦處自家討，難道是閨中未讀女兒經，可算得不守閨門第一人。</p>
<p>（衣白）伙伴們將這些荒唐言語，來　備木蘭，木蘭並不見氣，只向他們冷笑了幾聲，從容的向他們說道，</p>
<p>（木蘭唱）你們見識太低徽，</p>
<p>不該應今日前來把我　？</p>
<p>你可知我此番千里從軍去，</p>
<p>為只為老父年邁已古稀，</p>
<p>代父之勞全孝道，</p>
<p>女裝男扮有何奇，</p>
<p>况且是國家興亡人人責，</p>
<p>執戈衛國昔汪琦，</p>
<p>今番邊寇圖人急，</p>
<p>我是為國犧牲責任宜，</p>
<p>可笑你們介淺，</p>
<p>竟然男女獨拘泥，</p>
<p>可憐守舊未知變，</p>
<p>偏把女兒如玩物欺，</p>
<p>弄得來一輩女兒盡葬送，</p>
<p>愛國心腸總不知，</p>
<p>國家觀念沒　　，</p>
<p>所以我打破歷朝舊習慣，</p>
<p>拋頭露面入軍機，</p>
<p>但知國在人民在，</p>
<p>殲滅邊寇固國基，</p>
<p>倘然是全國女兒都如我，</p>
<p>何至於國弱民貧被人欺，</p>
<p>所以是愛國何分男與女，</p>
<p>同仇敵愾一心齊。</p>
<p>（表白）木蘭說完了這一大篇的話，伙伴們個個佩服，說道，</p>
<p>（衆伙伴白）花將軍言之有理，小弟們自知理屈，請將軍恕罪吧。</p>
<h3>賣大餅的難民</h3>

<h3>愛的敎育（十）</h3>
<p>— 亞米契斯著　雲舫繪</p>
<p>忽洛佩梯開口說，「我的書包呢？」被救的母親拿着書包淚說，「讓我拿了吧，讓我替你拿了吧！」這話聽的人們現出笑容，洛佩梯終於被小心的送上馬車了。　（災難完）</p>
<h3>「生」與「活」</h3>
<p>— 難記者</p>
<p>養難民，使難民能「活」，但養了一輩子，難民依然是難民。</p>
<p>授難民以生產技能，使難民能「生」；每個難民有了生產技能，難民就是有能力的國民。</p>
<p>敎育難民，不但使難民能生活，而且使難民能過「有意義的生活」；這樣，難民就成為有能力又有知識的好國民了。</p>
<p>以前曾經出力出錢救濟難民的人們，請大家對這次難民協會籌募生產教育經費的事，再努力一下，完成澈底的「救人」功德！</p>
<p>科學常識</p>
<h3>槓桿的偉大</h3>
<p>科學家說：「沒有槓桿，就沒有機器」　從這句話看來，槓桿的重要，也就可想而知了，槓桿即是機器的原始呀！</p>
<p>但是什麼呌做槓桿呢？這名詞未免帶點書卷氣，但照字面上講也就不十分難懂，槓就是槓子，桿就是桿子，牠是棍棒一類東西而已，手枚可以呌槓桿，扁担也可以呌槓桿，不過牠的形狀並不一定是直的，隨運用而變易罷了。</p>
<p>人們最初利用槓桿，就等於運用機器一樣，當樵夫去打柴，他怎樣的用斧頭？怎樣的用扁担？然後又怎樣的挑起那担柴？這完全表現出槓桿的作用，所以人們利用槓桿來代替勞力，增加生產，其意義和現在人使用機器，實在沒有什麼兩樣，因為槓桿，牠也以在一固定點的周團轉動自如，可以在工作效能上發生機器的作用。</p>
<p>現在讓我們看看天平的構造吧，天平的臂是槓桿，兩端各掛　一盤，便可應用，牠的臂的中　被支持着，兩盤的重量相等便算是平衡，若放一物在一端，則此盤馬上受地心吸力作用而下降，但若放同等物於另一端，則兩盤依然恢復平衡，因此兩盤對地心吸力是相等的，這天平的臂便是槓桿，支持着臂的樞　的一點呌「支點」。</p>
<p>此外學校小孩遊戲的撓板，也是槓桿，牠是一條長板担在木架上，這支持着的一點，同樣的也呌支點，小孩子坐在兩端，可以上下推動，其重心相差或同等，則上下平衡之象立見。因此槓桿的原理是「小力和長臂的長積，等於大力和短臂的乘積」。</p>
<p>對槓桿的一端所加的力，呌「動力」，反抗其作用的另一端的叫「重量」，每個槓桿無論其形狀如何，皆有三點，即「力點」·「重點」·和「支點」。</p>
<p>但這三點並不是固定的，有時也根據其作用而　動呢，比方說吧，天平撓板的動力，或用力在一端，重量或反抗力在另一端，而支點則在中間。但與此同類的如剪刀拉鈴等皆是，——皆是支點在動力和重量之間的。所以此種槓桿，我們呼之為第一類槓桿。</p>
<p>但有時支點在一端，重量及抵抗力反在中間，如此動力則又在另一端。在這種情形之下，我們便呼之為第二類槓桿。例如陸上的獨輪車，車輪是支點車身是重量，車夫是動力，又如水裏的划船，在水裏的漿身是支點，船身是重量，船夫是動力。</p>
<p>此外還有第三類的槓桿，支點在一端重量在另一端，動力則在中間，比如人的臂膀即是一例，手上捧着物品是重量，肘的連結處是支點，撓骨上的筋力便是動力。</p>
<p>但是槓桿不是固定於一個形式的，有時牠可從第一類變為另一類槓桿，比如說罷一個人想從地面上把梯子對墻或對石頭舉起，墻或石頭便是支點，梯子本身是重量，同時是臂；人的手是動力。</p>
<p>當人開始舉梯的時候，以手棍其一端，則重量在支點和動力之間，故屬於第二類。但當梯子漸被舉起時，人手向下移動，梯的體積大部分轉在人手之上，即動力介於支點與梯之一端之中間，故為第三類槓桿。</p>
<p>知道槓桿的原理和其日常應用的實例，這是有趣的事情，因為牠能使你用小力制勝大的抵秔力，以輕的物體移動重的物體。牠的原理，即支點的一邊的力，乘其到支點的距離，等於另一邊的力乘其到支點的距離。若小孩重三十公斤，棒長三公尺，支點在距其他一端半公尺處，則可移動約重一百五十公斤的石頭。</p>
<p>近來科學發達，槓桿的作用被廣汎的利用到鐵路的機器，摩托車，活動橋　，印刷機，起重機，以及其他種種進化的器械上。</p>
<p>讀者們不妨體會槓桿的原理，了解槓桿構造，利用槓桿的功能，這是本文的用意。</p>

<h3>報販的話</h3>
<p>第十報童學校袁祥生</p>
<p>在滬戰未爆發之前，那時我在蘇州賦閒着沒有事做，趕到上海想找些事情做做，居住在我哥哥的家裏，約有一月多的光景，發生了戰事，戰後的生活愈覺得難過，百物昂貴，我哥哥受了經濟的壓迫，家庭間現出難以維持的狀况，我想减輕哥哥的負担，於是開始過那報販的生活，起初覺得是很榮苦，後來漸漸的慣了，也並不覺得怎樣，現在我每日早上五點起身，天還未破曉，有些人還正在好夢未醒時，致在路上和好些勞工們走着，到了望平街，守候那報紙出版，大約在六點多吧，各種報紙才陸續出版。（未完）</p>
<h3>一週戰事</h3>
<p>鄂中日軍西進</p>
<p>鄂中戰事，本週來，頗形活躍，據謂日軍近欲打開局勢，曾由武漢調師開贛，更由合　調師開粵，有南侵北海，北攻南昌之企圖，故日來日軍分三路進攻漢水，沿漢公路步步前進，一在永隆之舊口前進，更有一路正在應城方面進攻。由於十餘日來日軍之全力進犯，鐘祥已為日軍所陷，華軍一面用全力與日軍應戰，一面更於鐘祥陷落時取得日軍之最大代價。據聞侵入鐘祥之日軍，損失盈萬，當時戰事激烈，混戰數日，日軍用大量瓦斯，迫華軍後退，並以猛烈砲火向華軍攻擊，華軍奮勇爭奪，前仆後繼，陣地被毀，乃改守有利地帶，報報載，侵入鐘祥之日軍，仍沿公路向北猛犯，直至現在為止，漢水東　各重要據點，雖有一部份已為日軍侵佔，但西岸華軍，兵力雄厚，工事堅固，而鄂北之洪山脈，現仍在華軍控制之下，故日軍欲在　下渡河西犯，斷難辦到。又，自京山北進之日軍攻入鐘祥後，即沿公路北犯，企圖配合淅河方面之日軍進攻鄂北重鎮襄陽及樊城。經華軍一度逆襲後，已退回鐘祥。</p>
<p>（按此日軍進攻目的顯係在切斷襄陽沙市間之交通綫，最後之目的，乃欲佔據宜昌及沙市，因沙市為交通咽喉，而宜昌更可用作空軍根據，從而轟炸重慶，成都，昆明，及中國西部各城市）。</p>
<p>廣東戰局</p>

<h3>收復我們的東北</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>假使不是出於過份的謙虛，便是出於無謂的膽怯。近來居然有一部份人說：「恢復『七七』以前原狀」，「速撤華中華南之兵」。這些又是什麼話！</p>
<p>這些話雖然不是我們最高當局的主張，也不是大多數民眾的信念，而牠們的影響却相當地大，并且相當地惡劣，我們不能不一再辭而闢之，斥爲荒謬！</p>
<p>敵人的貪慾，得寸進尺，歷來已得到了充份的證明。當初不是有人挨次說過：我們只要守住錦州；我們只要保牢長城；我們只要保全河北；我們只要安定黃河以南，這一套話麼？而敵人的行動是怎樣呢？假使我們現在說，恢復「七七」以前原狀，他們當然連「八一三」以前的原狀也不肯與以恢復；速撤華中華南之兵，當然只有更加進兵西北。我們要遏滅他們的貪慾，雖然不必高唱進攻高麗或臺灣，却至少要收復我們的東北。</p>
<p>這不是說，討了大價，預備對方還價。這是說，我們只有懸了這樣的目標，全力以赴之，才能達到抗戰的最後目的：保全我們的領土與主權，而徹底摧毀敵人的貪萌。</p>
<p>不久之前，我們的中央政府已經派出了東北四省的主席，這真是可喜的消息：可見我們的中央政府沒有丟棄或忘却我們的東北，而此後事有專責，收復東東北的希望，就容易實現了。</p>
<p>據昨天美聯社的電報，東北有「東北抗日會」主持「二十萬人共分十軍」的游擊隊，又有馬占山「已抵熱河西部」，其「目標爲齊齊哈爾」的消息，益發使我們歡欣鼓舞起來。只有這樣，才是全面抗戰，徹底解決的辦法。過份的謙虛，無謂的膽怯，都是用不着的！</p>
<p>現在，假使要談條件，我們至少要說：恢復「九一八」以前的原狀；速撤我國境內各地之兵！換言之：我們要收復我們的東北！</p>
<h3>張阿炳</h3>
<p>— 李紹忠</p>
<p>搬進宿舍已經一個多星期了。每天早晨我們都還睡着的時候，這老頭兒就輕手輕腳地跑進寢室裏來掃地揩桌。我第一天一瞥見他，就覺得很面熟，屢次想問，都給他臉上憂抑而沉默的表情所打斷了。今天中午，這老頭忽然蹣跚地跑上樓來通知我有電話。我一聽他的杭州口音，就開口問了。果然，這老頭就是「張阿炳」。張阿炳也十分驚奇地張大了他那雙老花眼睛望着我，嘴裏「呵呵」地冒着熱氣，差不多有五分鍾講不出話來。</p>
<p>眞的，整整有四年了。他額上的皺紋已更深地陷了下去，花白的頭髪已全變白了。現在他忽然又遇到一個闊別四年的青年小友，真是難得的機緣啊。</p>
<p>那年第一屆學生集中軍訓開始，我們被集中在杭州南星橋一座大軍營裏，足足訓練了三個月。營房側門邊有一家小雜貨舖，這舖子還帶賣「餛飩」，五分錢一大碗，味道不錯。舖主是一對老年夫婦，他們有一位天真秀美的小姑娘。</p>
<p>雖然我們僅不過停留了三個月，可是一千多個「學生軍」至少有一半以上是和這雜貨舖老夫婦混熟了的，尤其大家都曉得小舖裏有一位小姑娘阿蘭。</p>
<p>每當我們的一區隊值班站門崗時，我自己完畢任務以後總要向區隊長告一刻小假，跑到小舖裏去飽餐一頓餛飩，抽上幾枝香烟。每次，那老頭兒總會拖着那根細長的旱烟袋走了過來和我攀談着。</p>
<p>他吿訴我呌張阿炳，在年青時也當過兵，退伍以後就在這營房邊擺着一個雜貨舖，專做兵大爺的生意，倒不算惡。他夫婦倆和兒子媳婦也可以度日了。後來兒子跟着軍隊奔跑，一去三年沒有一點消息回來，年青的媳婦不久也沒了，留下這一個孫女兒，就是阿蘭。</p>
<p>當我向他提醒說我在四年前曾在南星橋大營盤受過軍訓時，他不覺走近過來一把拉着我兩隻手，高聲呼了出來：</p>
<p>「李先生，真難得，我們在這裏又碰頭了。」</p>
<p>「眞也想不到，你怎的會到此地來做事的？你一家人現在都在上海嗎？」</p>
<p>張阿炳聽了我這問話，突地把頭低了下去，聲音更加發啞：「李先生，這却說來話長：前年冬天，××人攻下了杭州。我們原沒有想到會亂成那個樣子，況且我們又沒有錢，所以沒有逃避。不想××人真兇惡，阿蘭被他們拖去要××，我的老太婆號啕着趕上去要和他們拚命，這有什麼用呢？結果兩個人都被拖了去。我一個老頭兒上天無路，入地無門，一無辦法，跟着一大批難民逃到上海來，咳！這真呌人……呵，不錯，李先生，你不是有電話在下面嗎？……」</p>
<p>「好，我先去接了電話，再來和你詳細談談」。</p>
<p>我轉過身預備跨出房門去，衹見張阿炳呆立在那裏不動，低着的面孔上正掛着兩行熱淚。我頭也不敢回，匆匆跑下樓去。</p>
<p>狐狸：兎兄，你渡我過去；我們永遠和平合作。</p>

<h3>論「她媽的」（上）</h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>文章寫不好，往往想去幹點救亡實踐之類，等到踏上了沙塲，立刻又想起槍幹之外，仍然不能廢棄筆頭，折中派的告訴：應該雙管齊來。這也隨他，姑存此說。</p>
<p>我本來想寫一些關於「萬里長城和運甓習勤」等類的題材，接着「姦不姦亦各方其志耳論」又那麼橫衝直撞了我的思意陣綫。這才擱筆抽烟，憬悟了洋洋洒洒萬言書，都不大有道理，倒不如一句「她媽的」來得風靡一世，板眼鏗鏘，既挺又硬又實胃。</p>
<p>且說「七君子可以託六尺之孤，可以寄百里之命」，假如一旦和「她媽的」精神脫鈎，也還是枉然。大概「孤」與「命」，都要有幾分「積極性」的人，才可與言「寄」「託」，否則那裏談得上「臨大節而不奪者」的「君子人歟」呢？</p>
<p>筆頭一展，又那麼走進「忠賢祠」去談鬼經了，於是趕忙退出，「先天下之憂而憂」的憂了一陣，「後天下之樂而樂」，尚未到門，有人說：「快啦！」　當口，我找到一聲「她媽的」。</p>
<p>本文所要論列的「她媽的」，　罵也，永以爲好也。更非執「她媽的」來敲扑或鞭笞天下，實在由於這一聲「非同小可」的「她媽的」滾出來之後，如果運用前瞻與後顧的眼光，這其間該是產生了一些怎樣新鮮的東西，值得我們大書特書而紀念一回的呵！</p>
<p>提起了這個「名不虛傳」的「國罵」，自然有它的世系年代，不過以前「流產」居多，兩片唇皮迸裂出一聲「她媽的」之後，看勁頭，雖然有「我不入地獄誰入地獄」的姿勢，臨了，「銜妝疾走」的，不止一次，大概有所期待，或者息事寗人，是頂天立地的「衛生之道」也未可知。的確「庸何傷」了！</p>
<p>基於這，識者謂失策，說者謂得策，這且慢點去批評，而「她媽的」本身上一波再折回來，感覺到當世士夫，既未可與立，又未可與傳，茫茫大地，知音者希，將誰與共而謀徹底的大展經綸，於是這一聲很完善的「勵令」，冤哉枉也地掛上販夫走卒們的「捉襟見肘」後的遮蓋門面的口角邊而成功，士大夫階層認爲俗不耐的東西。活生生貶入草莽英雄間的口吻者，還是許多「功名文章」之外的文章裏，才有得看到</p>
<p>然而不然，「她媽的」竟縱橫了當代！摧枯拉朽地奠定了中國的新基礎！</p>
<p>這是國民性轉變時期中的一個新　　嗎？</p>
<h3>江陰城守記及其他</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>據小說小話云：「江陰城守記，即荊駝遺史中之一種，而易爲通俗小說」。孫楷第「中國通俗小說書目」錄入並註明「未見」。按，遺字當爲逸字之誤。小說小話又云：「書中四王八將，皆有姓氏，而稽之別種紀載，幾若亡是公。且國初王之陣亡者，僅有尼堪與孔有德，事在滇粵，不在江陰也。大約所謂王者，係軍中綽號。蘇郡之變，有所謂八大王者，亦其倫也。」</p>
<p>小說小話的作者曾見過「七峯遺編」，因爲該書第十五回即爲「爲薙髪激反姑蘇郡，詐拈香襲殺八大王」，所以纔引「八大王」來作例證。殊不知就在通俗小說本所根據的文言的「江陰城守記」（清韓菼作）裏，就有如下的記載：「損去三王十八將。」「（八月）十一日，大清兵攻北門，七王死之。」「十二日，大清兵仍攻北門，二都督死之。」「十四日，江陰詐降，薛王死之。」「二十九日，大清陽攻南城，十王死之。」據「江上孤忠錄」所云，則另有所謂八王者，於八月十二日觸銃而死。其他諸王之死，與「江陰城守記」記載相同。小說小話的作者於此似稍嫌忽略。</p>
<p>小說小話另引的「雙忠記」（以抵抗元兵的張順張貴爲主人翁）「雪窖冰天錄」（阿計替南渡錄的改編）以及「采石戰記」（以虞允文戰功爲主），與「江陰城守記」一樣，都是我所嚮往面亟欲一讀的小說，可惜似乎都已失傳了。</p>
<p>因講到江陰城守記之便，使我想起「江陰義民別傳」，我有一位朋友讀過別傳以後說道：</p>
<p>「只要百姓人人都肯抵抗，國家絕對不會亡於異族之手！人人都肯抵抗，則政治的腐敗不會發生，任何邪說都成不入耳之談，當然不會有漢奸，並且格外會引起國際間的同情，而獲得援助，百姓的力量是大的，遠超出任何力量之上。不信，我們就可以看看明末江陰百姓的抵抗滿清。他們以彈丸之地，烏合之眾，抵抗滿清數十萬大兵，至八十三天之久，而與以重創。不信，我們也可以看看現在山西和河北一帶，遊擊戰的成績，他們究竟給了日軍以怎樣的打擊。</p>
<p>「我希望閱讀本書的人，有這樣一個想像：清兵和韃子就是今日的什麼？劉良佐就是傀儡政府裏的漢奸，七王和二都督之流，就是什麼井，什麼川等；而抵抗他們的江陰，是國內任何縣市：許用是我們現代學校裏的學生；高瑞和徐玉揚是我們目前的鄉農；黃明江和湯三老兒是我們日常所見的機匠和小工；程璧和何氏兄弟是我們都市間作着一般買賣的商人。這裏所寫的一切戰爭」，就是現代的戰爭。敵人的兇殘，我們的奮鬥，也都是眼前的事實。我更希望我們同胞，人人有作許用以至陣二郎和黃毓祺的決心，而我們的賢明長官，人人會有閻陣二典史的智勇和忠烈。從前江陰的終於失敗，不足爲奇，因爲那時並沒有第二個江陰，現在我們處處就是那時的江陰，我們決不會失敗。因此，我們自不必因從前江陰的失敗而喪氣，却反要因其失敗，而激發我們的同仇之心。這樣，我們便一定會成功，來報復我們的國仇。」</p>
<p>因爲他的話很是警闢，所以鈔在這裏，以便讀者參閱。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>大家留神一聽，果然警鍾還在「噹噹」的亂響，不禁發了聲喊，一窩蜂的向門外逃，女人和孩子被擠倒地的很多，哭喊聲閙成了一片。葉團長正待喝呌大家守秩序，誰知敵機業已飛到了頭上。他到底比較有經騐，情知這里正是目標，連忙跳下戲臺，三腳兩步越過大井；剛剛跑到寺門口，炸彈業已落下來了，「轟」的一聲，大雄寶殿的一角連同戲臺，嘩啦啦的坍了下來，接着又投下來一顆燒夷彈，報恩寺裏很快的冒起了一團火，一蓬烟。</p>
<p>葉團長來不及回頭細看，一個勁兒的只是向鄉公所跑，還沒跑到鄉公所門口，便聽得東南兩面起了一陣機關槍和步槍聲，接着又是「蓬」的一聲小鋼砲響。</p>
<p>「了不得！他們居然竟乘虛進攻了！」葉團長心下一急，連忙闖進鄉公所去，恰好梁團附也正從裏面跑出來，兩下撞了個滿懷，因爲來勢過猛，幾乎都跌下地去。</p>
<p>葉團長把手扶住了門，喘着氣，還沒有開口，便有一個步哨氣急敗壞的跑來報告說：</p>
<p>「報告團長，獨眼李聯合了×軍，從東南兩方面向這里進攻，現在趙大隊長正在七里墩地方堵截。」</p>
<p>「趕快傳我的命令，調一大隊兩中隊去增援。」葉團長向那步哨揮了揮手，又回頭對梁團附說：「你趕快去呌鎮上的民衆準備逃難，這里的一切，都由我來佈置。」</p>
<p>這時，敵機還在不斷的投彈，爆炸聲和坍屋聲，不絕於耳，到處火光沖天，民眾鬼哭神嚎的四處亂竄，世外桃源頃刻間變成了人間地獄。葉團長咬了咬牙齒，立刻動手來作巷戰的佈置。他對這一帶的地形，平時就曾不厭求詳地細心研究過，要在怎樣一個有利條件下，才會獲得克敵致勝的效果，即使是一草一木，也都不肯放鬆。他先利用獨眼李逃回去的那片樹林，作爲掩蔽全鎮的陣地；此外，鎮上有一條小河的支流，許多樓房臨河建築着，他便呌兵士埋伏在樓房裏面，踞高臨下的向敵軍射擊；又利用河畔民房和大樹，分別埋伏兵士，建築機關槍陣地。</p>
<p>一切都佈置好了，葉團長正待到前綫去巡視，忽然看見他弟弟方英，背着一桿步槍在路上跑，連忙喊住了他說：</p>
<p>「方英，你快回家去，呌家裏人都上船。」</p>
<p>「不，我要到前面去打敵人。」方英倔强地說。</p>
<p>「你先回去了再來也來得及，和敵人打仗的機會是很多的，我們要忠孝兩方面都顧全。」</p>
<p>方英很不樂意的向回家去的路上走了，葉團長也開始到前綫去巡視，對一個埋伏着待機的部隊，都作着這樣的訓話：</p>
<p>「弟兄們，獨眼李和×軍這次乘虛來犯，我們千萬不可怕他們，在和他們接觸的時候，要絕對的鎮靜！記着，要鎮靜！」（三一）</p>

<h3>救救學徒</h3>
<p>— 亮</p>
<p>我們應該注意學生意的階段　希望實行保育會擬定的辦法</p>
<p>「學徒」這兩個字，在吾們的心目中，恐怕不會顯得陌生吧。在今日中國無數的舊式商店或工廠裹，大多都有着這種所謂「學徒」。他們的生活是挺可憐，挺悲慘的：他們的父母，為了貧窮，爲了飢餓，却不得不將他們的那些可愛的，活潑伶俐的小孩子，送進商店與工廠裏去「學生意」，去當「學徒」。</p>
<p>每個學徒，就好像是一個「僕役」，一個「傭工」，不過在年齡上較為小些罷了；大概都在十歲以上，约十二三歲的光景。當吾們一走進上海的那些商店裏的時候，吾們就準會看見一個或幾個十二三歲的學徒，身上穿着一套破舊的，千縫百補的衣服，正在忙着趕做各項打雜的事情的。</p>
<p>提到學徒，他們的生活眞會使人傷心悲痛。每日早晨天剛開亮，當別人尙在甜蜜的睡鄉中的時候，他們就要起身了，之後，就開始工作，一直到晚上，必須要等到其餘的「夥計」，「先生都去睡了的時候，才得睡覺。任何艱難，任何吃重的工作，都會推在當學徒的身上去，他們既沒有充分的時間，可以用來休息休息，或者消遣消遣；也沒有什麼例假的日子，可以呌他們來「樂」上一天的—好容易，只有逢到了節日，如廢曆年，端午，巾秋等日子，他們才有機會刷刷鞋子，理理衣服，鬆一口氣，去「玩」一天了；之外，就簡直找不出第二個日子，可以供他們的「遊」「玩」與「休息」，總之，他們的日常生活，就是「繁忙」與『劇力」而已。</p>
<p>反而，假使事務見忙了，他們還得做夜工，而偶然不小心地如果將事情做錯了，他們更要受到嚴厲的責罰，好像罰立，罰跪，打耳光，打屁股，打手心…之類，一切都是使他們的生活，覺得難堪的。雖在天熱的時候，汗一身一身地在淌下來，或者在天冷的時候，兩只手凍得都發紅而裂開了，他們却始終還要做那些如燒飯，洗衣服，抱小孩，倒夜壺的雜差—這種非人的生活，一定要經過三年或五年的辰光，才算學習滿期，才結束了「學徒生活」。「滿期」這一個名詞，對每一個當學徒的，眞是怎樣好聽，開心的字眼呵！就是他們的父母，聽見了他們的兒子，現在是「滿師」了，心中也是覺得無限地歡欣，愉快的他們的兒子，匕經「做出頭」了，升了「夥計」，「司務」之後，人家至少得對兒子稱上一聲「先生」呢!而在商店與工廠方面，也必須你做了先生，才正式許可支用薪金；在當學徒的一個階段中，照例都是沒有薪金的，即使有，也不過是極少極少的一些鞋襪錢，理髮洗浴錢而已</p>
<p>諸位讀者，看了上面這些關於學徒的生活狀况的記述，心中總不免耍有些不安與憐恤吧。在事實上這種度着悲慘的生活學徒，在上海，在中國，正不知道有着多少。吾們知道，現在在做學徒的人，在將來未始也不可以變成大商店與大工廠裹的經理，而現在在當經理的人，在往昔的確也是那些學徒呀。所以，學徒的時期是重要的，學生意的階段是値得吾們注意的，只有在學徒這一個時期裏，預先養成豐實的經騐與至上的道德，然後，吾們才可希望有優良的，高超的工商業經理，職員產生；那末，我們為什麼又要使學徒們度那可憐的日子呢？</p>
<p>現在有上海兒童保育會者，擬定了救濟學徒的辦法數則以供關心工商業的人們的研究和參考，其用意可謂是極好的，茲照錄於後，獻於讀者。</p>
<p>（一）我國政府，亟應厘訂「學徒法規」，量低限度，要限制學徒工作時間，每天以八小時為準，至多不得過十小時。</p>
<p>（二）學徒的年齡，最小要在十五歲以上。</p>
<p>（三）學徒的工作，要在學習範圍以內，如燒餐，洗衣，抱小孩，倒夜壺等事，不得呼喚學徒操作。</p>
<p>（四）學徒的期限，至多不得過三年。</p>
<p>（五）僱主除供給學徒食宿外，應酌給生活費用，每月至少三元。</p>
<p>（六）每天晨晚，僱主應給予學徒進修的機會，如進夜學校或補習學校。一切學費，應由僱主負担。</p>
<p>「僱主們－救救學徒吧！」吾不禁發出了這一句呼聲。</p>
<h3>妙手療心</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>“Young　Dr.　Kildare”</p>
<p>米高美公司出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>醫師所負的責任，是可以左右一個病人的生命。我們有句俗語，呌做「醫師有割股之心，」這果然是接受了「割股」可以療疾的錯誤，但也可見醫師對於一個病人所應該負的責任至巨且大了。在上海，（自然各地，各國都有。）因為近在我們身邊，就時常看到了，聽到了醫師的「玩忽業務」的慘案發生，這是應該從醫師本身組織健全起來，而社會也應該予以糾正的。在電影上，我們自然不會忘了「萬古流芳，」那個為了發明徽菌，受盡了揄椰，而終於為後來的病人造福的法國大醫師路易士巴士登。</p>
<p>「妙手療心」也是敘述一個少年，呌詹姆士吉爾載的，怎樣忠於他的責任。他在醫校畢業以後，他的父母，他的愛人，都希望他在本鄉服務，但他為了以求深造，投身到紐約平民醫院去實習。在這中間，因為他助手的大意，致死了一個病者，於是受到社會的抨擊，甚至院方將革除他的職務。同時他也診治着一位企圖自殺的富家女，精神病專家南波迪奧斯醫師診斷她確患精神病，吉爾戴獨持異議。為了要明白這富家女的病狀，他自然又受到了許多阻難，但他終於從各方面去證實她不是精神病，而「妙手療心，」連那位「性烈如火」的跛足老醫師願意傳其絕技。</p>
<p>這是好萊塢電影，我們自然不苛求第個醫師還要兼職偵探，不過對於一個病人的病狀，是不能憑浮面所看到的而加以診治，這樣，往往會置人於死地的。如那位精神病專家似的，因為自己是專家，而以病人的生命如兒戲；同時，也就因為是專家，才有不斷的慘案發生。我希望這電影能够收到它預期的效果。</p>
<p>劉亞理斯的詹姆士吉爾戴，演得有沉着有力，尤其是他看到富家女病起時的內心欣喜之狀，表演得很深刻。里昂巴里摩亞的跛足醫師，正如說明書上所描寫的「性烈如火，暴躁易怒，」以他精湛的演技，來演飾這種角色，自然是迎刃有餘的。</p>
<p>至於導演，不能把這影片處理得輕快，活潑一點，自然是他失敗的地方。開場吉爾戴學成歸來那段戲，却是很好的</p>
<h3>「蘇彝士」觀感（下）</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>坐在銀幕底下，膠片一格格在眼前閃過，「運河之偉大工程，卒吿完成，雷氏策騎登山巔，俯瞰船隻航行運河中，廻念前情，如烟如夢，但東妮平日勉勵之言，似猶犖廻耳際」，是的，我是為劇中人所感動的，回得家來，坐在書桌前，為了想寫這篇觀後感，我又重復去搜索我的印象，我是又不自禁的浸淫在這複雜的感情中，而「蘇彝士」影片中的大塲面呢，它却祗為思索劇情中速帶記起來的陪客，我細細一想，我才記起來，「蘇彝士」中大塲面是不少，不過這些大塲面用的大都是遠景，在直織上不能很好的處理它，氣氛不够，他給我門的印象，也就並不如何深刻了。</p>
<p>導演者所擅長的倒還是在「倚紅偎翠」「生離死別」這些上面，如雷塞布的出使埃及和郡主分別，雷塞布和東妮的初見，雷塞布回法看見郡主已嫁拿破崙，雷塞布父親的死等等，在這些塲面上，不僅幾位演員的戲上，在織接上，也特別顯得可愛，例如雷塞布和郡主相別，其中有一塲是這樣接的：（一）郡主在樓窗上向下望（近景）（二）雷塞布登馬車　（中景，俯攝）（三）郡主原地位的近景，身體漸轉，（表示雷塞布離去，一直到看不見）然後回轉身來，走近沙發，坐下，壓不住離情，伏到沙發上低泣。這塲戲，在織接上是活潑自然，並且氣氛濃郁，而洛麗泰陽的戲，也非常可愛。</p>
<p>像這樣可愛的戲，洛麗泰陽是有好幾塲，泰納鮑華也有二塲，（一）加法時顯見郡主坐在拿破崙旁，（二）他的父親死；至於安娜蓓拉呢，她是更可愛的，從所謂「淸溪裸浴」起，一直到她死止，她那種奔放，熱情的性格，是扮演得非常突出的</p>
<p>也許這是我的癖愛，因為這樣熱情奔放的性格眞是少年人的朝氣的最好說明。但，誰又不能為那樣的性格所感動呢</p>

<p>石家飯店地方不大，倒也還幽靜。坐定以後，朱愛人便問：何家兩位小姐，用些什麼菜？何家兩位小姐說：『我們都是外行，好在我們什麼東西都吃。仍請你們兩位，當地人熟悉一些，隨便有幾樣菜，我們就可以吃飯了。」吳君素道：『我已問了一問，鲃肺湯是有的了，此外還要幾樣菜。』朱愛人道：『我們這裹，因為是個水鄉，魚蝦倒也新鮮。記得我初從美國回來時，吃東西非常謹愼，什麽都不敢吃。見家鄕人吃那些醉蟹醉蝦，把我嚇也嚇死了，因想那種不衛生的東西，如何入口。但現在也已司空見慣了，不過那種東西，我勸人家燒熱了吃為宜。要照我們當翳生的說起來，這也不好吃，那也不好吃，可吃的東西太少了。』朱愛人說時，吳君素已經開好了幾樣菜，授與朱愛人道：『請衛生家過過目！』那也不過五六樣菜，自然魚蝦的菜較多。她又說道：『從前有兩句詠蘇州風景的詩道：「蝦菜蠡湖月，鶯花虎阜春，」我們很賞它對仗的工整，也可見這裹的蝦菜是早有名的了。』朱爱人笑道：『文學家終究是個文學家，開口來，便是什麽詩咧，詞咧，君素姊真是出口成章，和我們雅俗不同。』吳君素道：『別罵人啦！這菜單經衛生家檢定以後，我們就吃飯。吃飯後還要借重你的車子，送我上學堂咧。』這時何　雙玉問道：『剛纔君素姊所說兩句詩中的虎阜，我知道就是虎邱了。但是蠡湖是在那裏？與這石湖相近否？」吳君素道：『蠡湖也不過一個故事中名兒。因為從前有個范蠡，什麼載了西子，泛舟太湖而去，後人便用了這個古典，稱之為蠡湖。如今蘇州有好幾個鄉鎮，用這個蠡字的，如蠡市，蠡口之類。總之中國人，一向就喜歡把有名人物，冠在地名上。兩位姊姊此番從上海來，那上海的別名有好多，什麼申江，黃浦，歇濱等等名稱，都不是為了從前戰國時有了黃歇一人的史事嗎？』說到那裏，儷玉向雙玉看看，因想昨天我們在到先烈墓的車子裏，還談過這事。還說把人名冠在地名上，是學的西洋人的樣，現在可知中國人就早有此風了（五九）</p>

<h3>續談崑劇　「哭像」「拾畫」曲譜之異同</h3>
<p>— 霽庵</p>
<p>長生殿「哭像」一折。悱惻纏綿。歌壇傳誦。實則脫胎於王　甫西廂。不特曲牌聯套。完全相同。即平仄襯字。亦步趨相隨。「快活三」之後。即緊接「朝天子」。別無他曲介於其間也。元曲聯套。「快活三」之後。輒接「鮑老兒」或「朝天子」爲特多。蓋套曲至「快活三」。劇已過半。緊張之後。必迂緩以舒其氣。「快活三」爲由快而緩之曲。「朝天子」爲緩曲。劇情至於「朝天子」。爲另一階段。而以之承前啟後者。則「快活三」也。故兩曲之間介以他曲者。以余之陋。實未見之。目「快活三」與「朝天子」同爲中呂入正宮之曲。「殿前歡」則屬雙角。雙調之曲。雖亦有借入正宮「端正好」聯套書。「殿前歡」一曲則不經見。又一劇曲韻。自始至終。例不更換。其換韻者。南曲衹「哭相思」。北曲中衹「貨郎兒」。「哭像」全劇用江陽韻。而間以家麻韻之「殿前歡」。亦鮮此例。襌翁君所舉。當有所本。甚願明示。以祛余惑。</p>
<p>牡丹亭「拾畫」折。先上小生唱引子「金馬兒」。「金瓏璁」前三句。「驚春誰似我。客途中都不問其他。風吹綻蒲桃褐。」接「風馬兒」後三句云。「雨淋殷杏子羅。今日晴和。曬衾單兀自有殘雲渦。」接上石道姑唱「卜算仙」。詞云。「無奈女冠何。識的書生破。知他何處夢兒多。每日價欠伸千簡。」然後引入圖中。小生唱「顏子樂」「錦纏道」「千秋歲」三支正曲。拾畫歸觀。道姑復上。小生唱尾云。「一生爲客爲情多。過冷澹園林日午　。（老姑姑你道不許傷心）你爲俺再尋一箇定不傷心何處可。」如此方爲一折完全之「拾畫」。無奈梨園中人。定要連唱並不銜接之「玩真」（即現在通稱之呌畫）將「拾畫」任意刪節。引子只唱二句。「錦纏道」及尾聲完全刪去。石道姑亦不上。惟清客單唱「拾畫」者。仍多唱「錦纏道」及尾聲。以存其真。而引子則通行只唱二句。石道姑亦皆不上。正如長生殿「哭像」折。「快活三」前有「滿庭芳」一支「朝天子」「四邊靜」之後，有「耍孩兒」「五煞」二支。今已刪去不唱。成爲通例矣。</p>
<h3>影壇動態</h3>
<p>四院對台映國片</p>
<p>怪事年年有，今年特別多。誰想得到在戰後的上海，國產影業會有這種飛黃騰達的一天。號稱美商的新華製片廠巨片迭出，現在居然快要佔據了四家首輪戲院了。自從本月十五日起，大上海將開映「武則天」。於是完成了四家頭輪戲院專映新華新片的新形勢，這是破天荒的一個盛舉。四院所映新華影片如下。</p>
<p>滬光：「木蘭從軍」</p>
<p>新光：「少奶奶的扇子」</p>
<p>金城：「化身人猿」</p>
<p>大上海：「武則天」</p>
<p>同時開映首輪西片的戲院，却減爲三家。即大光明，南京，和國泰。</p>
<p>「影城」打進大光明</p>
<p>藝華新近攝成的巨片「影城記」，係由路明主演。現在已經打算在一家華貴的頭輪戲院開映，茲探悉正在接洽中的是大光明，這樣一來，國產片向西片戲院繼續侵入的形勢日益露骨了。</p>
<p>「文素臣」徵求男角</p>
<p>老牌製片廠的聯華公司不久也要動工了。據說資本是由吳性栽籌集，用合眾影片公司的名義攝製「文素臣。」這部「文素臣」是採自舊說部「野叟曝言，」係費穆編劇，曾由京劇名角麒麟童王熙春合演於卡爾登，賣座甚盛，現將搬上銀幕，將全部儘量採用新人，現在最感到困難的是男主角，因此合眾公司便登報徵求。有志銀幕的青年（年齡一十至三十五歲）均可應徵。</p>
<p>影塲爭攝跳舞塲</p>
<p>吳邨繼「孟姜女」的新片「歌聲淚痕」前日假百樂門舞廳拍攝舞景，並奏唱新歌。塲面十分偉大，同進岳楓導演的「雲裳仙子」也在新華攝影塲拍攝跳舞塲的偉大塲面。該片係陳雲裳繼「木蘭」後的時裝悲情巨片，係黃嘉謨新作劇本。有偉大的歌舞塲面。像這次國華新華都在拍舞塲的戲，足見舞塲佈景在影片中的重要性了。</p>
<p>新導演兩名上市</p>
<p>國產製片業發達的結果，形成導演額供過於求的現象。因此在醞釀中的已有兩位新導演快要產生了。一位是技術專家陳翼青，陳君供職影界十年於茲，對攝影剪接卡通均曾致力，經騐豐富。他將要開拍黃嘉謨的劇本「三劍客。」由韓蘭根殷秀岑劉繼羣合演。另一位是王引，他是演技老到的男明星，現將初試導演的滋味，片名暫定「新亡命者。」將由袁美雲主演。</p>
<p>胡蝶在港俞環肥</p>
<p>據新近由港來滬之影人稱：最近曾看見胡蝶，她的玉體較前越發肥胖了。雖然體重幾鎊，胡蝶拒絕宣佈，但看看已經够發福了。真合俗語所說「心廣體胖」四字。按胡蝶已答應主演新華新片「楊貴妃，」這樣肥胖的身體，真像我們的玉環姐姐了。</p>

<h3>歡宴金素琴席上　歐陽予倩談改良舊劇</h3>
<p>— 聶格</p>
<p>金素琴四日抵港後，翌日歐陽予倩，顧無爲。廬翠蘭及中藝劇團團員十數人特假桂園舉行歡宴，席間各人隨便發表意見，而形成一小小座談會，金素琴首先說：「在淪陷區的上海，四面在敵人的獰視下，什麼救亡工作都不很容易展開，一般的同胞是在度着驕奢淫靡的生活，我自從演出了「梁紅玉」，「桃花扇」這幾齣戲，敵人便注視了我，歐陽先生被逼走之後，我更感到窘困，連行勸也失去了自由。在歐陽先生由廣西回到香港時，我就有來港的動機，但一延再延，直到今天才能够南來，我也許可以呼吸一口較自由的空氣了吧。今後預備努力實行自己的工作，並多參加義演。」</p>
<p>歐陽予倩於是論到改良舊劇的題目上去，他說：「改良舊戲，因爲味兒不同，所以引起很多人的反感，正像老八股反對白話文，浪漫派和古典派的鬥爭一樣。但久而久之就會好的，大凡一件有意義的工作，開始必然艱難，只要我們抱定決心努力去做定有好的收獲；在戲劇史上，定有光榮的一頁，雖然別人說金小姐最先上了我的當，可是，最先成功也是她呢，現在戲班裏正多着醒悟的女性，但爲着飯碗，都沒有勇氣跑出來，希望她們能够跟着時代前進。」</p>
<p>接着，顧無爲說舊戲在這個時候，已走到了末路，每個前進的藝人對它已不發生興趣，但它也有的特長，我們應該取其長，捨其短，配合現代要求來演出，所以我們要把它改良，但話劇工作者，把牠撇開了，所以幾十年來，都沒能把牠扶得起來，甚至漸漸衰落了下去，我們今後就要循着這目標前進。</p>
<h3>「琵琶記」與「趙五娘」</h3>
<p>— 玉繩</p>
<p>兩公司不謀而合同時攝製　在銀幕上將形成對峙之局</p>
<p>因爲古裝片的「風靡一時」，顯然對於取材方面已感覺到枯澀，這可以由華新製片廠攝製「琵琶記」，而國華影業公司也同樣的攝製「趙五娘」一事證之。</p>
<p>華新的「琵琶記」，爲楊小仲繼「化身人猿」以後的新作，楊小仲以前沒有導演過古裝片（默片時代例外），這樣是破題兒第一遭的嘗試，劇本特地鄭重其事的請陳大悲編寫，服裝由廬世侯設計，趙五娘一角由闊別多時的陳燕燕飾演，蔡伯喈則由劉瓊担任，華新準備在陣容方面取勝。</p>
<p>國華同時也準備攝製「趙五娘」，這與華新可說是「不謀而合」，所見略同。國華的「趙五娘」大概仍將由「孟姜女」的女主角周璇主演。趙五娘的故事在意　方面似乎沒有什麼可取處，但「情節」是極哀感動人的。兩影片公司之所以競取以爲題材，不外爲此。國華目下正在招考「趙五娘」的男女演員，大概不久亦將開攝；也許將與華新的「琵琶記」在同一時期完成。華新的出品，向歸新光大戲院開映，而國華出品的首映權則屬之於金城大戲院，屆時雙方各顯神通，勢必形成對峙之局了。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一一八）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>連環套是武戲中的羣戲</p>
<p>朱光祖進山盜鈎時，真是冒了極大的危險，運用着他的計巧，幸而才得如願以償，將一位英勇無敵的綠林前輩用藥酒灌醉，在他項邊插上他黃賢弟的單刀，盜走了竇爾墩的虎頭雙鈎。要是次日竇爾墩醒來，看見單刀插在項邊，再一發現應手的兵刃失落，這不用猜想就知道是黃天霸夜人連環套啦。這可以先顯點手段給姓竇的看看，呌他曉得姓黃的不但是本領高强，而且還念他是位不採花的前輩綠林好漢，故而不肯暗害於他，只在他的脖頸旁邊插下一把刀，藉以表示暫時保留他的首級之意。第二天雖是雙方約定比武，但是姓竇的已經失去應手的兵器，再加以自己年邁，天霸方在少年，萬一第二次再被姓黃的殺敗，豈不更將英名丟盡。所以後來經能言巧辯的朱光祖當面一質問，說「你姓竇的有幾個腦袋，你不念我們黃賢弟的恩義，反倒真要動起手來，豈不是太不懂交情了麼？」竇爾墩自覺無言可對，才用「插刀盜鈎恩情重，血海冤仇一筆鈎」。的幾句詞來結束這塲公案。試想如此滔天大禍，這樣困難的一椿大事，並未殺死一人一卒，就把御馬取回，兇犯擒獲，這件大功勞不完全要歸到姓朱的身上麼？但是事又不然，朱光祖不但不願居功，反倒受了極大的一個委屈，那天累了一夜，好容易把雙鈎盜回寓處的當兒，頂頭遇着天霸等出來尋找於他，見了面不容分說，先抓住他的衣襟，說他偷盜自己的兵器及連環套的腰牌，不知幹什麼勾當去啦。這一盆冷水望頭上一澆，無論那位再有涵養的朋友，此際也要表明心跡，另投門路去了。所以朱光祖將入山情由原原本本叙述一遍之後，就要一別而去，最後兩句話也說的很漂亮，他說「事情可是姓朱的作的，讓黃賢弟露這一回臉。咳！交朋友也無非是這個樣子吧。」</p>

<h3>Fourteenth Anniversary of the Premier's Death: Chairman Chiang's Telegram to the Nation Announces the Implementation of Spiritual Mobilization, Hoping that the Transformation of the Spirit Will Be Reflected in Practical Actions to Comfort the Soul of the Premier and the Martyred Heroes in Heaven; Li Zongren Says Chiang's Leadership in the War of Resistance Has the Support of the Whole Country and Should Be Recognized as the Guarantee of Achieving Final Victory</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the entire nation on the 12th, announcing the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization. The full text is as follows: To the Commanders of all War Zones, Commanders-in-Chief, Pacification Commissioners of all Provinces, Chairmen of Party Headquarters in all Provinces and Cities, Governors of all Provinces, and to be forwarded to all officers and soldiers, and all compatriots across the country: Today is the fourteenth anniversary of the Premier's death. I, Chiang Chung-cheng, with the utmost sincerity and solemnity, announce the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization. All the outlines, methods, and national covenants have been published in full and printed in newspapers. The Premier said, "Man has the use of the spirit, not relying solely on the material body." He also said, "Weapons are material, and the ability to use these weapons depends entirely on the spirit. Comparing the two, the power of the spirit accounts for nine-tenths, and the power of matter only accounts for one-tenth." The Premier devoted his life to the revolution and experienced battles. All his teachings were based on personal experience and trustworthy words. Examining the historical facts of the revolution, we initially overthrew the Qing Dynasty with bare hands and established the Republic of China. Later, we swore to launch the Northern Expedition, removed the obstacles of warlords, and completed national unification, all relying on the triumph of the spirit to lay this foundation. Unfortunately, the revolution was not completed, the mentor passed away early, the national crisis deepened day by day, and foreign aggression became increasingly urgent. Now the War of Resistance has entered its second phase. Looking north to Yanyun and east to Jingguo, the fierce edge of the bandit's aggression has not been curbed, the pilgrimage to the mausoleum is not possible, countless compatriots are awaiting rescue from suffering, and the lifeline of the nation and the people is in the balance of life and death. The success of the revolutionary nation-building cause is still extremely distant. Tracing the reasons for this, it is purely due to our failure to vigorously embrace the Premier's doctrines and teachings, our failure to invigorate the spirit, and our failure to concentrate our will. Or, although we were temporarily inspired, we failed to be strong and persistent, so that the enemy and bandits still harbored the idea of attacking our spirit and winning over the hearts of our people. Self-insult invites insult, and there is a reason for this. Thinking of this shame, we can understand it. The current peril of the national destiny and the rampant arrogance of the powerful bandits are due to our past spiritual and behavioral decadence and laxity, which have led to these adverse results. Now, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, the stakes of victory or defeat and survival or demise are extremely high. If we still do not strive to improve, catch up quickly, jointly restore the inherent morality of our nation, and consistently develop the revolutionary spirit of the Premier, and unite under the three common goals of national supremacy, national interest supremacy, military first, victory first, and concentrated will and concentrated power, eliminate the obstacles of decadence and corruption, cultivate a vigorous and enterprising spirit, each exert their ability, and each fulfill their common duty, and work together to strive in the great cause of the War of Resistance and nation-building, how can we save ourselves and the country, and how can we face our national ancestors and the descendants of future generations? I, Chiang Chung-cheng, mourn the loss of the Premier, remember the teachings that can be followed, and recognize that National Spiritual Mobilization is the foundation for building the army, building the country, and overcoming the enemy. Following this path, one can equal one hundred, and ten can equal one thousand. I sincerely hope that all officers, soldiers, men, women, and compatriots from all walks of life in the front and rear, in all provinces and cities across the country, will be sincere and faithful, deeply understand and consistently implement the points revealed in the outline and promulgation of regulations, pledge to implement the National Covenant, establish the will to resist the war, transform the spirit, and embody it in practical actions, to make a concrete commemoration of the fourteenth anniversary of the Premier's death, to comfort the soul of the Premier and the martyred soldiers and civilians in heaven. This is where we, as those who survive, can fulfill our duty to be loyal to the country, and this is where we can wash away the great shame of the Chinese nation being invaded, trampled, raped, burned, and killed by the brutal enemy. As the saying goes, "Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone." It is imperative to be consistent inside and out, and do not treat it as commonplace. Chiang Chung-cheng respectfully serves in the Secret Bureau, Chongqing. (Telegraph of the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Zongren, in a certain place, formerly told a reporter from this newspaper that Chiang is wise and decisive in leading the War of Resistance, and the military and civilians of the whole country are united in supporting him to the end. We should recognize this as the guarantee of achieving the final victory. After the war situation turned to a new stage, the Japanese army is already in a position of being besieged on all sides. However, they are still trying to fight like a cornered beast. In the future, there will still be local offensives, but it is impossible to take anything more than a few points. The situation in the second phase of the War of Resistance is expanding day by day, and Japan's resources, military strength, and finances are all extremely difficult. The result is to squeeze the people and incite anti-war actions. He estimates that Japan's war of aggression will fail in a maximum of two years. We have already determined a plan to continue fighting for five or ten years. When talking about the weaknesses of the previous phase of the War of Resistance and the adjustment of domestic affairs, he said that because the War of Resistance is intensifying, sweeping away all corrupt phenomena can achieve twice the result with half the effort. He deeply regretted Wang's initiative to negotiate peace with Japan. (Special dispatch at 11:00 PM on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guilin telegram: Bai Chongxi and Xu Yongchang, on the evening of the 10th, gave speeches separately at the closing ceremony of the military conference. Bai instructed all generals to pay attention to training soldiers, leading soldiers, and using soldiers, and all political and staff members to work hard to serve, enhance party power, and implement the political training of one party, one doctrine, one country, and one nation. Army Commander Du Yuming, on behalf of the whole body, replied that he would resolutely follow Chairman Chiang's instructions at the Nanyue Conference and the instructions of Director Bai and Minister Xu, work hard to reorganize and train the troops, and accomplish the mission. All the generals then returned to their defenses. Xu Yongchang spoke freely on the 11th about the situation of the northern and southern war situations, saying that after the Battle of Wuhan, it was extremely difficult for the Japanese side to find the main force of China. They had no choice but to expand and organize puppet troops, and the actual crisis was even greater because the puppet troops could revolt at any time. The military actions in Ji, Jin, Su, and Lu provinces were swift, and they specifically sought to win battles against the Japanese army and avoid defeats. If Japan's attempt to oppress failed, it would be equal to failure. Yan insisted on resisting the war in Jin province and worked hard to strengthen the political work of the army. As for the entire reorganization and replenishment work of the Chinese army, it has been largely completed, and the troops have long been replenished. The material equipment has also been strengthened, and in terms of morale, since the July 7th Incident, the morale has been rising day by day. (Special dispatch at 9:00 PM on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Elite Troops from Guangxi Recently Transferred to Southern Guangdong to Increase Defenses; Japan Attempts to Invade the Mainland from Qiong Island; Heavy Casualties for the Japanese Army in Central Hubei</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Japanese warships along the coast of eastern Guangdong have failed in their intimidation tactics towards Chaozhou and Shantou and have fled elsewhere. The West River is still quiet. Japanese troops at Lan Gang were defeated and retreated back to Sanshui City. There are no traces of Japanese troops in the Lan Gang Jiting area. On the South Road front, Director Bai recently transferred a certain elite division from Guangxi to the designated location to increase defenses. At the same time, along the coastal areas of Hepu and Fangcheng, Bai also telegraphed orders to intensify the monitoring of the Japanese army's actions. (Fast News Agency telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is actively invading the mainland from Hainan Island. The local Chinese army is bravely resisting. In recent days, the Japanese army has suffered more than 2,000 deaths. There are currently about one division of Japanese troops on the island, 20 armored vehicles, 200 armored cars, and 40 aircraft. The new Japanese airfield in Haikou has been completed, and six Japanese warships are moored outside Haikou port, patrolling the sea. (Fast News Agency telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army in central Hubei has been ambushed by the Chinese army in the vicinity of Yuan Yangzi Town and Changchou Store, north of Zhongxiang, and has suffered heavy casualties. They are now holding the line of Zhongxiang Jiukou, waiting for reinforcements, and dare not continue to advance north. The Chinese army on the front of the Hanyi Highway is continuing to counterattack Yonglong River, threatening the flank of the Japanese army on the Jingzhong Highway. (Fast News Agency telegram on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Active Near Jing Le</h3>
<p>Xing Ji: The Chinese army has been extremely active in Tianzhu Mountain and Chaoyang Mountain near Jing Le in recent days. On the evening of the 6th, they attacked the northeast two passes in separate groups. The Chinese army bravely charged into the North Pass, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. By dawn, they had completely withdrawn. The Japanese army in the city has the appearance of continuing to invade Loufan and Lanxian counties. The Japanese army at Heilongguan Pass has suffered considerable casualties after days of attacks by the Chinese army. Local people have personally seen Japanese wounded soldiers being transported eastward through Tumen, and the number has reached more than 400. (Telegram of the 11th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Western Zhejiang Recovers Zhapu</h3>
<p>Jinhua: A certain unit of the Chinese army in western Zhejiang, after recovering Haiyan on the 9th, continued to attack and advance towards Zhapei. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army resisted for a time, but after a brave attack by the Chinese soldiers, the remaining Japanese troops fled from Pinghu towards Jiaxing and Jiashan. Zhapu was then recovered. (Telegram of the 12th)</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on National Mobilization</h3>
<p>A week ago, this newspaper discussed the matter of spiritual mobilization, and commented on its outline and implementation measures; in particular, it hoped that social leaders and youth, as well as leaders in various circles and institutions, would practice what they preach. Now, the Chongqing telegram transmits the full text of the outline and implementation measures of spiritual mobilization, as well as the National Covenant Pledge and its organization, which are published in yesterday's and today's newspapers. After reading this, it is found that there are some points that were not only not covered in the previous discussion, but also not clearly stated in the original text. Please elaborate on them.</p>
<p>So-called mobilization, of course, has no exceptions. However, if it is military mobilization, it is limited to matters related to the military, and nothing else is involved. Economic mobilization is limited to matters related to the economy, and nothing else is involved. Even in terms of the implementation of military or economic mobilization, it may be divided into several phases or several parts. In its phase and in its part, an order for general mobilization must be obeyed and acted upon immediately, needless to say; those that have not reached their phase or are not in their part are only preparing, and it is not a hasty move; moreover, from the point of view of discipline, organization, and order, it can be said that hasty action is not allowed. Therefore, the so-called no exceptions in various mobilizations is still a relative principle. Spiritual mobilization is different. All citizens must accept it uniformly and act as one, and there is absolutely no exception. This is the first thing that should be recognized.</p>
<p>All gatherings take faith as the center and volunteerism as the driving force; therefore, the so-called freedom of association, freedom of thought, and freedom of speech are applicable. In short, freedom is the principle; only with freedom, there is not complete agreement, nor is agreement forced; those who share the same path and the same aspirations form a society. Today's spiritual mobilization is also called a society in terms of organization. From the central government to the provinces and counties, all are called societies, and the chairman of the National Defense Supreme Committee is also the chairman of the society. However, its nature is completely different from that of all other gatherings. In other words, citizens' participation in the Spiritual Mobilization Society is by no means limited to volunteers, nor is it permissible to have citizens who are so-called not sharing the same path or the same aspirations; if one were to say that they do not share the same path or the same aspirations in spiritual mobilization, then it is by no means a question of whether or not they are members, but fundamentally a question of whether or not they are citizens. Therefore, all citizens are naturally in the ranks of spiritual mobilization, and are naturally in the Spiritual Mobilization Society; there is no exception, and it is absolutely not allowed to stand aside. This is the second thing that should be recognized.</p>
<p>Mobilization: is a fact, is an action, must be concrete, must be active; only spiritual mobilization is slightly different. The National Covenant has only the following twelve articles:</p>
<p>(1) Do not violate the Three Principles of the People;</p>
<p>(2) Do not violate government laws and decrees;</p>
<p>(3) Do not violate the interests of the nation and the people;</p>
<p>(4) Do not be a traitor or a submissive subject of the enemy;</p>
<p>(5) Do not participate in traitorous organizations;</p>
<p>(6) Do not be an officer or soldier of the enemy or the traitor;</p>
<p>(7) Do not lead the enemy and the traitor;</p>
<p>(8) Do not spy for the enemy and the traitor;</p>
<p>(9) Do not work for the enemy and the traitor;</p>
<p>(10) Do not use the enemy's and the traitor's bank notes;</p>
<p>(11) Do not buy the enemy's goods;</p>
<p>(12) Do not buy food and all items for the enemy and the traitor;</p>
<p>All say "do not," which are negative restrictions, and are not provisions for action. We do not need to annotate the positive significance of all these restrictive provisions, nor do we need to mention their possible effectiveness; however, the simplicity and ease of implementation of these restrictive provisions must be recognized by any country or any citizen in wartime. In terms of what the country needs from its citizens during the War of Resistance, and in terms of the responsibilities and obligations that citizens should bear to the country during the War of Resistance, they are all far above these twelve restrictive provisions; therefore, if citizens are loyal and faithful to this covenant, it is still not enough to say that they are not ashamed to be citizens during the War of Resistance; now, under spiritual mobilization, what is expected of citizens is only these twelve items, then the citizens' faithful acceptance can be said to be the minimum obligation. This is the third thing that should be recognized.</p>
<p>The matters involved in the covenant, or someone sells, or earns a living through labor, and thus gains profit; although this person may be forced by the needs of food, clothing, and children, and has no other intention, how can their objective results be understood! As for the general public, some may think that the prohibitions of the covenant are indeed beyond reproach, but that absolute faithfulness to the covenant may be inconvenient or disadvantageous, but because it is inconvenient and disadvantageous, there is a slight deviation, and it is still considered understandable. But where does the distinction between good and evil lie? Where does the distinction between the virtuous and the unworthy lie? The boundary between what is understandable and what is not is also easy and beneficial for the individual and for the present. This is what everyone can do, what everyone is happy to do, and what everyone will strive to do; how can there still be evil, unworthiness, or what is unpardonable in the world? The so-called good and the so-called virtuous must not consider the immediate petty interests of the individual, but only distinguish between right and wrong and choose accordingly; knowing that it is wrong, even if it is convenient and beneficial to oneself, one will not do it; knowing that it is inconvenient and disadvantageous, one will never be perfunctory and deviate, but must adhere to what is right; only in this way can one be good, only in this way can one be virtuous. In other words, the distinction between good and evil, virtuous and unworthy, lies in whether or not one can sacrifice the convenience of the individual, obtain the renunciation of what is wrong; one cannot sacrifice the convenience and benefit of the individual and perfunctorily do what is wrong, and there is no room for understanding. Therefore, one must not calculate gains and losses in what is prohibited by the covenant, and must be loyal and faithful to it. This is the fourth thing that should be recognized.</p>
<h3>National Spiritual Mobilization Outline: Gathering National Spirit Towards a Common Goal, Establishing a Unified National Salvation Ethic for Oneself, and Firmly Believing in a Unified Nation-Building Faith for the Country</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) National Spiritual Mobilization Outline (Continued)</p>
<p>(V) Transformation of the Spirit</p>
<p>Now that the unified morality and unified faith that the people should establish have been clarified, we will then proceed to explore what kind of sound spirit is suitable for the military interests of the country and nation today, and is sufficient to achieve the goals of resisting aggression and building the nation. We will then cultivate or eliminate them separately to create a good, consistent environment and thoroughly transform the spirit of our nation's people. To list them by category, there are the following:</p>
<p>(A) The Dazed and Dreamlike Existence Must Be Corrected</p>
<p>Life is the foundation of the spirit. Without a rational life, there is no sound spirit. Therefore, the dazed and dreamlike existence of indulging in sensual pleasures and material gains must be thoroughly corrected, and the creed of a new life must be practiced. Otherwise, not only will the individual's energy be depleted and their spirit scattered, harming both themselves and the country, but it will inevitably become a common practice, causing the entire society to suddenly exhibit the phenomenon of national subjugation, inviting the world's contempt and the enemy's deepening intrusion, which is not only harmful to the country but also affects the military.</p>
<p>(B) An Aspiring and Vigorous Vitality Must Be Cultivated</p>
<p>Following the dazed and dreamlike existence, that which acts as a parasite on the national spirit is the atmosphere of despondency and decadence. The existence of this atmosphere is actually caused by both psychological and physiological reasons. On the psychological side, it is due to the lack of national self-confidence and individual self-improvement. People do not believe that the nation can be revived, or they view the cause of national revival as unrelated to themselves. If these two kinds of psychology are not corrected, the aspiring and vigorous vitality of the people cannot be cultivated. On the physiological side, exercise, hygiene, orderliness, cleanliness, and even the habit of getting up early must all be promoted and practiced. Only then can the national spirit be enriched, and vitality be radiated, to undertake the extraordinary revolutionary cause.</p>
<p>(C) The Habit of Living for the Moment and Seeking Personal Safety Must Be Eradicated</p>
<p>There is a spiritual phenomenon in the war of resistance that cannot be ignored, namely, the lack of determination to swear revenge among the people at the front, and the prevalence of private plans to avoid hardship and seek ease among the personnel in the rear. The former phenomenon will lead to an increase in the enemy's compliant subjects, and the enemy's influence will spread. The latter phenomenon will lead to a decrease in the nation's soldiers and weaken the will to fight. The motivation for both is due to the lack of a firm concept of national supremacy and the persistence of the habit of living for the moment and seeking personal safety. To correct the former phenomenon, it is necessary to clarify the principle of great revenge from the Spring and Autumn period, which is, "Even after a hundred generations, revenge for the country is permissible," so that the people in the lost territories will never forget the concept of national supremacy and national supremacy. To correct the latter phenomenon, it is necessary to promote the atmosphere of "offering one's life in the face of danger," and commend the loyal and righteous who have died for their duties. It is also necessary to strictly enforce discipline and promote justice, so that everyone regards avoiding duty and secretly seeking safety as the greatest shame. Only then can the spirit of revolution be established.</p>
<p>(D) Selfish and Self-Serving Attempts Must Be Shattered</p>
<p>Only seeking to preserve one's own life and property, and increase one's own fame, position, and rights, without regard for the interests and survival of the entire nation, is the same as those who have military power wanting to preserve their strength and territory, with the same selfish motive. If this selfish psychology is allowed to develop, personal opinions will inevitably be placed above all else, private reconciliation will be placed above all else, and even the expansion and satisfaction of individual fame, position, rights, and desires will take precedence over everything. Pushed to the extreme, it will inevitably sacrifice national interests and undermine the war of resistance plan. Now, when the war of resistance is fierce and survival hangs in the balance, if one is still not aware of this, it is not only unwise but also unkind. Under the purpose of national spiritual mobilization, this kind of ingrained habit must be eliminated. The authority of public opinion should be promoted and fully corrected, so as to eliminate selfish views, contribute wholeheartedly, and return to the utmost impartiality and sincerity.</p>
<p>(E) Conflicting and Confused Thoughts Must Be Corrected</p>
<p>Since the war of resistance, although the thoughts and opinions of the entire country have fundamentally formed a unity, there are still many branches and leaves that are divergent. If they are allowed to coexist in a mixed manner, they will inevitably lead the people's minds away from the principles of national and national supremacy, military victory first, and concentration of will and strength mentioned above. Therefore, it is necessary to establish standards, correct them separately, so that the foundation of unity can be further consolidated. It is especially necessary to actively guide and create a common national opinion, so that our people and youth can embrace the same ideal for the country's future in their understanding, that is, to overcome the enemy and win victory with one heart and one mind. This is also to create a permanent unity throughout the country after the war and avoid divergences and conflicts. This standard should be based on the current factual needs and national interests, which all the people of the country should and willingly accept. Briefly, they are: 1. The Three Principles of the People that do not violate the supreme principles of the National Revolution; 2. Speeches that do not advocate ideals that transcend the nation and harm the absoluteness of the country; 3. Not to undermine the unity of military and political orders and administrative systems; 4. Do not use the situation of the war of resistance to achieve any attempt other than the interests of the country and nation. All thoughts and opinions should follow this yardstick. Those that violate this meaning should be corrected and rejected together. Those that conform to this meaning should be promoted in many ways, so that from this foundation, they can be enriched, developed, and become a general trend.</p>
<p>The above five are only a brief overview of the main points. If we want to achieve a thorough transformation of the national spirit, we must further expand it. First, we must seek the enrichment of the national spirit, then the concentration of the national spirit, and even more the revolutionization of the people. The so-called enrichment means to make it vigorous and vibrant, strong and firm, and have the power to overcome the environment and resist difficulties. The so-called concentration means to seek its close unity, with one heart and one mind, turning the people's will into a fortress, so as to reach the state of absolute sharing of weal and woe and never being separated. The so-called revolutionization means to dedicate oneself to the revolutionary cause based on the supreme concept of loving the nation and loving the country, to be loyal to the government and doctrine internally, and to resist the enemies of the nation externally. One must be incorruptible by wealth and honor, immovable by poverty and lowliness, and unyielding by force. Furthermore, one must use this spirit to influence compatriots, and even further use this spirit to defeat enemy countries. If the transformation of our national spirit can truly reach these three standards, then the purpose of national spiritual mobilization can be said to be completed.</p>
<p>(VI) Mobilization Leadership</p>
<p>Although the target of spiritual mobilization is the entire nation, the following types of personnel are the first to bear the responsibility of advocating and implementing it:</p>
<p>1. Party Members and Civil Servants</p>
<p>Our Party, inheriting the legacy of the Leader, is implementing the National Revolution. Before the revolution's fate is achieved, our Party bears the responsibility of administering the government. Now, many provinces and regions have fallen into enemy hands, and tens of millions of people have suffered devastation. How should our Party members blame and encourage themselves, and earnestly examine whether their public and private actions are models for the general public? At the beginning of implementing spiritual mobilization for the general public, the spiritual mobilization of party members must first be carried out. Every party member must have the moral practice worthy of the heavenly duty in this extraordinary period. Compared with the general public, they must be more hardworking and diligent, more frugal and honest, and more courageous to sacrifice. This is in terms of party members. As for civil servants, especially administrative officials at all levels and local self-government personnel, they bear the heavy responsibility of implementing government orders, coordinating the military and civilians, and enriching military preparations. Their spiritual actions must be sufficient to gain the people's faith and be worthy of being models for the people. Therefore, in the implementation of spiritual mobilization, in addition to party members, it must first be implemented by civil servants in order to advocate for the general public.</p>
<p>2. All Military Personnel</p>
<p>All of our military personnel should unanimously recognize the duty of a soldier. It is not only to fight against enemy troops, but also to know that the army represents national authority and that soldiers should represent the national spirit. Moreover, in China today, when all the people's organizations have not yet been fully established, the national army is the center of the country's strength. Therefore, soldiers must become the center of the people's faith in morality. Today, the great responsibility of saving the country and the nation rests entirely on the shoulders of our soldiers. Therefore, all our officers and soldiers must first implement the spiritual mobilization of soldiers. All our soldiers should absolutely have the national salvation morality and nation-building faith, possess the sound spirit necessary for resisting aggression and reviving the nation, and never forget loyalty and filial piety. They must also be benevolent to their compatriots, trustworthy to their superiors and subordinates, and above all, respect human rights and discipline, so as to promote our nation's inherent lofty ideal of peace. If all the military personnel in the country unanimously strive to carry out spiritual mobilization and promote the glory of China's inherent morality, then the power of this will be immeasurable in its manifestation in the military, and there is no doubt that all the compatriots in the country will be unanimously moved and unanimously respond.</p>
<p>3. Leaders from All Walks of Life Across the Country</p>
<p>Before implementing spiritual mobilization among the general public, we also eagerly hope that the leaders of the national cultural, industrial, religious, and various professional organizations, as well as the backbones of society, and the respected elders in various places, will all sympathize with the purpose of national spiritual mobilization and personally act as its leaders. Since the war of resistance, the virtuous and talented people across the country have done their best to be the rear support for the country's military, and their contributions have been great, and the destruction of various cultural undertakings and industries in the war zones, and the sacrifices they have suffered, are also enormous. However, the difficulties and hardships of the country in the future will be further deepened. So far, the spiritual strength shown by all walks of life across the country is not enough to meet the needs of the country's wealth. We deeply hope that they will take a further step, take the lead in implementing spiritual mobilization, with one heart and one mind, and contribute all their strength to the country and the nation. If leaders and backbones from all walks of life can personally practice and advocate for it, then the people in various localities and professional departments will have a greater chance to follow suit and the trend will rise. As for the cultural world, the media world, and the writers, we hope that they will examine the responsibility for the safety of the country and the rise and fall of the nation. The misfortune and fortune of hundreds of generations, and the rise and fall of thousands of years, depend on whether the leaders of all walks of life can accept the meaning of spiritual mobilization at this time and fight together.</p>
<p>4. National Youth</p>
<p>Youth are the lifeline of the country. We have special expectations for the youth across the country who have received or are receiving education, regardless of whether they are out of school or unemployed. The fate of the country and the nation will certainly depend on the youth in the future, and today it also depends on the youth's efforts and dedication. Japan wants to conquer our China, and what it hates most is the youth of China. Therefore, in the enemy-occupied areas, countless youths have lost their lives and suffered misfortune. Since the military campaign, many youths in the front and rear have endured hunger and cold and worked diligently. This is something that the country should especially cherish and supervise. Today, as we implement national spiritual mobilization, we earnestly hope that the youth across the country will unanimously participate and take the lead enthusiastically before the general public. We especially hope that the youth of our country will unanimously practice China's inherent national salvation morality, and unanimously believe in the Three Principles of the People. Do not be divided, do not be doubtful, do not be decadent, do not be reckless. Unanimously believe in the supreme truth of national supremacy, national supremacy, military first, and victory first, and work together to engage in the struggle for resisting aggression and reviving the nation.</p>
<p>(VII) Mobilization Implementation</p>
<p>The implementation of spiritual mobilization largely depends on the self-awareness of each citizen's conscience, and mutual encouragement and enlightenment are the means to help them become self-aware. As for legal discipline, it should only be used to supplement the enlightenment and encouragement that is lacking. Therefore, the main work focuses on the appropriateness of advocacy, propaganda, and education. When implementing it, we must first measure the effectiveness of each work, whether it can be as we expected, and then set the goal to seek, and devote our efforts to it. Choose economical methods to seek simplicity, speed, and certainty. Avoid official articles and cumbersome procedures. Use the existing organizations and natural methods, guide the situation, so as not to disturb the people and waste time and hinder the cause. Now, the implementation aspects are divided into the subject of implementation, the steps of implementation, the methods of implementation, and the matters of implementation, which are described separately.</p>
<p>(A) The Subject of Implementation</p>
<p>The work of spiritual mobilization should be carried out by the entire party, government, military, and people, working together and jointly, in order to be thoroughly implemented. (1) On the party side, on the one hand, supervise the party members under its jurisdiction to unanimously implement spiritual mobilization, and conduct assessments and training. On the other hand, lead party departments and members at all levels, and connect with cultural institutions, using various propaganda methods to publicize the essentials of spiritual mobilization to the entire nation, negatively correct the discrepancies in the people's thoughts and opinions, and actively provide the theory to promote spiritual mobilization. (2) On the government side, on the one hand, reform the decadent and lax bad habits in society, and crack down on the life of drunkenness and dreams. On the other hand, supervise the civil servants and local self-government personnel under its jurisdiction to implement spiritual mobilization and popularize it among the entire people. At the same time, guide schools at all levels to implement spiritual mobilization education. (3) On the military side, on the one hand, political departments at all levels stipulate that spiritual mobilization is the main subject of spiritual education for soldiers, and also take the lead in promoting spiritual mobilization among the people. On the other hand, commanders of all levels of troops implement the implementation of spiritual mobilization level by level to all soldiers. (4) On the social side, various cultural groups, people's groups, professional groups, and various magazines and newspapers should unanimously use the essentials of spiritual mobilization to assist the work of spiritual mobilization by the party, government, and military, so as to be able to implement it effectively and thoroughly. (5) On the family side, on the one hand, create an environment for promoting the main points of spiritual mobilization (such as practicing thrift, diligence, hygiene, and getting up early). On the other hand, use the method of mutual encouragement by fathers, mothers, and brothers to urge all members of the family to strive for the great purpose of resisting aggression and reviving the nation. It is also necessary to universally cultivate the concept that national interests are higher than family interests. (6) Responsible Mainstay: The people responsible for promoting spiritual mobilization should be the leaders at all levels in the government and troops, the parents in the family, the principals and teachers in the school, the chairman in the group, the editors in the newspaper and magazine, and the county magistrates, township chiefs, and baojia chiefs in the county, district, and village. These are all the leaders of the group and the mainstays of the cause. On the one hand, they must be required to set an example, transform the wind, and move the wind. At the same time, they must also regard spiritual mobilization as their necessary duty, and carry it out throughout their entire cause.</p>
<p>(B) Implementation Steps</p>
<p>The steps for implementing spiritual mobilization, in addition to the planning, assessment, and interpretation of the outline for the entire spiritual mobilization work, and the supplementation of methods, etc., should set up a spiritual mobilization guidance and promotion agency to implement it. All party, government, military, and civilian agencies and groups should conduct the following steps in a practical manner: (1) Formulate Specific Plans: The supervisors and those in charge of party, government, military, and civilian agencies and groups should formulate systematic and orderly specific plans in accordance with the instructions of the spiritual mobilization outline, according to the nature of the matters listed, which belong to their own powers or business scope, and implement them in a practical manner. (2) Penetrate Subordinate Members: On the one hand, party, government, military, and civilian high-level agencies or groups should first supervise their direct subordinates and all lower-level agencies, and use opportunities such as small group meetings to formulate appropriate methods according to the actual environment, and implement them in a practical manner. They must supervise layer by layer and use methods such as competition and inspection to learn from each other, and truly penetrate every member of their subordinates to popularize it among the general public. (3) Utilize Inherent Groups: In addition to the people's groups and cultural agencies directly led or managed by the party and government agencies, other inherent groups in society, such as religious groups, hometown groups, and trade groups, should also be utilized as much as possible to help promote the work of spiritual mobilization. (4) Pay Attention to Liaison and Conduct: The promotion of spiritual mobilization in various places should be based on the principle that party, government, military, and civilian agencies and groups should do their best to promote it in accordance with the established plans. Those that involve the general public or multiple aspects depending on the nature of the matter should be linked and cooperated with each other.</p>
<p>(C) Implementation Work</p>
<p>The work of spiritual mobilization can be divided into the following four types according to its nature:</p>
<p>(1) Propaganda and Creation: For example, the suggestion of the main points of spiritual mobilization, the establishment of national concepts, the promotion of national morality, the establishment of confidence in victory, the refutation of wrong remarks, the transformation of absurd psychology, and the development and explanation of the theory and practice of spiritual mobilization, etc. This work should be carried out by the propaganda department of the party, the political department of the army, and various newspapers, schools, and cultural agencies and groups. (2) Training and Improvement: Propaganda and creation are only the first step in spiritual mobilization. What follows is training and improvement. For example, if the error of the people's thoughts has been enlightened by the method of propaganda, it must be further used to gather and other training methods to hone the revolutionary personality, establish the awareness of resisting aggression, discuss the general trend of the world, and study the historical facts of the rise and fall of the country and the prosperity and decline of the nation and foreign enemies, so as to progress together in the enrichment and unity of the spirit. Also, if the decadence of the people's will has been pointed out through publicity, it must be further promoted to expand military training and the study of hygiene, and the implementation of the new life, etc., to improve the people's physical and mental work. This work should be implemented by the social department of the party, the political department of the army, and educational institutions and schools. (3) Supervision and Persuasion: The promotion of spiritual mobilization, although it originates from top to bottom, but in order to make its effect real and not deceptive, it must also rely on the mutual supervision and encouragement of the people. In the family, family members and brothers should warn and encourage each other. In agencies and groups, all members should encourage and learn from each other. In society, regardless of the status of the people, they should supervise and persuade each other in the relationship of comrades and compatriots to promote their reform. (4) Research and Promotion: The work of spiritual mobilization is neither a perfunctory matter, nor is it enough to proceed with common sense in peacetime. It must have the spirit of research and creation. Today is an extraordinary period, so there must be extraordinary work to adapt to it. To have extraordinary work, there must be extraordinary research and design. Therefore, if we want to seek long-term progress in all aspects of spiritual mobilization, it depends on the party, government, military, and people from all walks of life to wholeheartedly research and strive to promote it.</p>
<p>(D) Matters of Implementation</p>
<p>The matters of implementing spiritual mobilization are based on the aforementioned improvement of the spirit, and the following matters are shown as a brief example, so as to touch the other things of the same kind. Detailed sub-items need to be supplemented. The following is described in detail: (1) Regarding correcting life: 1. Rectify the daily life of the people, and crack down on all inappropriate entertainment; 2. Ban luxury and falsehood and all unnecessary waste; 3. Limit consumption and reduce the import of luxury goods; 4. Persuade the people to reduce their living standards and implement universal austerity. (2) Regarding Cultivating Vitality: 1. Cherish time, cherish human resources, and material resources; 2. Expand wartime production and increase the working hours and efficiency of the whole country; 3. Organize and train the people and give them appropriate wartime work assignments. (3) Regarding Eradicating Bad Habits: 1. Publicize the failure of the enemy's strategy and the fact that our army is getting stronger and stronger in battle; 2. Expose all idle and lazy elements, and force them to serve in wartime; 3. Eliminate the dependence on international countries, fluke psychology, and the illusion of a compromise in the middle. (4) Regarding Shattering Attempts: 1. Resolutely eliminate corruption; 2. Encourage the people to destroy their homes to help the country and donate personal property to the war effort; 3. Collect all military supplies and contribute to the national government; 4. Resolutely promote various movements to contribute to the country spiritually or materially. (5) Regarding Correcting Thoughts: 1. Rectify the organization and training of people's groups; 2. Unify the organization and work policy of cultural groups; 3. Ban disputes and illegal activities that hinder the war of resistance; 4. Correct the tendency of opinions in various newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>(VIII) Conclusion</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the content and implementation outline of spiritual mobilization have been briefly described here. Finally, there are still three meanings that must be told to those responsible for implementing spiritual mobilization, namely: (1) The implementation of spiritual mobilization must seek its thoroughness inside and out, and the entire renovation. Do not allow it to grow due to small details, so as to harm the spirit of the people. Therefore, we should examine our body and mind and strive for governance, and we must focus on the initial germination of wrong habits, and we must also start with the small details of life. (2) We must seek the persistence of its effect. Spiritual mobilization is by no means just an encouragement of temporary blood and emotion, generating a five-minute national salvation fervor. It is necessary to deeply instill the supreme concept of the country and nation in the minds of the people, and it must be verified in daily life and behavior, so that there is no guilt in the heart, and then the event can not exceed the yardstick. (3) The establishment of national spirit must seek its perseverance and steadfastness. If it is swayed by external pressure and temptation, then this spirit is not enough to complete the extraordinary cause. Therefore, the theory of the revolutionary outlook on life must be thoroughly promoted. This is also what needs to be paid attention to during implementation. In short, national spiritual mobilization is the main condition for resisting aggression and winning victory, and also the latest weapon for saving the country and building the country. Today, if the people of China are not absolutely emotionally numb, there is no one who does not deeply feel the grief and indignation of the precarious national situation and the suffering people. Therefore, it is to identify the goal and strive forward in unison, not only to fulfill one's national duty, but also to seek the highest comfort in life. And the future destiny of the nation and the nation for thousands of years will surely begin here. We hope that our compatriots will rise up together. (11th telegraph)</p>

<h3>Navigation on the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River: Restrictions are Getting Stricter</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to today's news, the restrictions imposed by the Japanese on foreigners' navigation on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are becoming stricter than before. The Japanese are not only inspecting passengers and cargo on foreign merchant ships more severely, but also, from March 1st, foreign ships without a Japanese procurement certificate will not be allowed to handle or transport goods. However, last week, when Jardine Matheson's "Tonghe" ship went to purchase rice not far from Shanghai, the Japanese refused to issue a procurement certificate. When German merchant ships went to purchase rice and cotton, they were also refused by the Japanese and were only allowed to carry passengers and other small amounts of goods. The only reason given by the Japanese for refusing foreign merchants to handle goods and navigate is that the right of inland navigation in the southeastern Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been transferred to the Japanese Nisshin Company for exclusive operation.

Pius XII then walked to the loggia, where countless faithful in the square shouted "Long live the Pope!" with great enthusiasm. The chief cardinal priest, Domenico, then approached Pius XII, removed his mitre, and replaced it with the papal tiara. The faithful present were all solemnly silent. Pius XII then recited a public prayer, and the faithful knelt down. The Pope then gave a blessing to the crowd, who rose and cheered thunderously. The churches rang their bells again until the end of the ceremony, which lasted until 1 p.m. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>Communist Party in Madrid Attacks Suburbs; City Reportedly Cleared</h3>
<p>Burgos – It is reported that the Communist Party is attacking the Salamonga residential area in the outskirts of Madrid and has occupied part of it. Fierce fighting is underway around the radio station of the National Defense Committee. It is also reported that Republican troops have been driven out of the three towns of Murcia, Alicante, and Cartagena by Communist forces. Several actors and actresses, identified as secret advisors to former Prime Minister Negrín, are said to have been arrested in Barcelona. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The remaining Communist Party members in this city were completely expelled yesterday evening by the troops of the National Defense Committee. The strongholds they occupied in the eastern and northeastern districts have been abandoned, and they are retreating to the outskirts. The whole city is as peaceful as usual, but gunshots and artillery fire can still be heard from time to time in the outskirts, as government troops are still pursuing the remaining Communist forces. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The Communist Party's provincial headquarters was originally located in the "Ritz Hotel" in this city. After the party launched its uprising, it stubbornly resisted there. Government troops immediately opened fire, causing the building to catch fire after being hit. When the remaining Communist forces retreated to the suburbs yesterday, they burned all files and documents, causing the hotel to burn down to rubble by this morning. According to a lieutenant of the government army, the fire brigade has successively retrieved a large number of new-style firearms and a large amount of food, such as sardines, meat, condensed milk, and even soap, from the hotel, which have been extremely scarce in the city since the outbreak of the war. They have been transported away in batches in as many as five military trucks, indicating that the Communist Party had been stockpiling military supplies for more than just a day. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Valencia – Several members of the Communist Party attempted to drive into the city in four tanks today, causing a rebellion. They were immediately intercepted by the detection team of the National Defense Committee. As a result of the engagement, all the Communists were arrested, and several were injured. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The Central Committees of the Communist Party in various provinces surrendered unconditionally to the National Defense Committee this afternoon. However, the "civil war within a civil war" has not stopped immediately. Some Communist Party members are still entrenched in buildings, resisting the enemy. For example, the northeastern part of the city is still the focal point of Communist resistance. Republican troops have now recaptured the Salamanca district and the famous Alcalá Street. The trenches there are in a mess, and bloodstains are still visible. Acts of ambush from various locations have not ceased. However, the city center is relatively peaceful, and the fighting is currently limited to the eastern district. The National Defense Committee has obtained the support of newspapers and the management rights of radio stations. It is now accusing the Communist Party of colluding with Franco, saying that the Communist Party suddenly rebelled when the country was in crisis, helping Franco's momentum and weakening the Republican army. At the same time, the Communist Party retorted, saying that Colonel Casado intended to cede the territory currently held by the Republican army to Franco, and that the Communists had seized the vehicles used to transport milk for the elderly and the weak. Although transportation in dangerous areas is difficult, the authorities are still distributing food. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Vienna) – Slovak Minister of Public Works, Ďurčanský, recently made another speech, attacking the Czech government, saying that its dissolution of the Tiso cabinet was illegal, because the cabinet could only be dissolved after the Slovak Parliament passed a vote of no confidence.

<p>(Berlin) – The German government authorities are closely watching the conflict between the Czech and Slovak ethnic groups. The former Prime Minister of the Autonomous Government of the Slovak Province, Tiso, is said to have sent a note to the German government, stating that the Czech central government's reorganization of the provincial government was a violation of the constitution and requesting that Germany uphold justice and act as protector to restore a legitimate political system. As of now, the German government has not responded. Although German newspapers say that the country does not intend to recognize the new cabinet of the Slovak Province, observers believe that the German government is unwilling to take a clear position on the "protection" of the Slovak ethnic group, so as not to cause unease in countries with minority ethnic groups, especially Romania, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Hungary. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – Foreign Minister Colonel Beck made a speech yesterday at the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, involving the political situation in Czechoslovakia, briefly stating that the national concept of the Slovak ethnic group has gradually crystallized over the past twenty years.

<h3>American Dock Workers Refuse to Load Scrap Metal for Japan; U.S. Authorities Ignore Japanese Representations; Another Aid China Rally Held in London; All-India Congress Condemns Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>(Washington) – According to news here today, the Japanese Embassy has asked the U.S. government to assist in obtaining wrought iron and other military raw materials in the U.S. The five ships worth of scrap iron that Japan currently intends to load in the three ports of Portland, Astoria, and Oregon have been unanimously rejected by dock workers, preventing them from being shipped out. Therefore, they have asked the U.S. government to facilitate this. The Japanese Embassy stated that this was a request, not a protest. Afterwards, when reporters interviewed State Department officials, the State Department declined to comment on the Japanese request, but its attitude seemed unwilling to take any action that would benefit Japan. The dock workers and overseas Chinese vigilantes on the West Coast of the United States have been refusing to load scrap iron for the Japanese for several weeks. To date, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the dock workers has become increasingly pervasive, with a great tendency to spread throughout the entire West Coast. (United Press dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Chamberlain Plans to Initiate World Conferences; Roosevelt Reportedly Fully Agrees; to Resolve Issues Such as Arms Limitation</h3>
<p>(London) – The Evening Standard recently reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain plans to convene a world peace conference in London, followed by a world disarmament conference. The detailed plan includes four items: (1) resolving disputes between Germany and Italy; (2) Western European countries establishing a new Locarno Pact, ending the arms race in air forces, and prohibiting bombing civilians by airplanes; (3) convening a world conference to resolve Germany's colonial demands and other issues; (4) convening a disarmament conference. U.S. President Roosevelt is said to have fully agreed to this plan. According to government officials, the international situation is clearer than at any time in the past year. Foreign Secretary Halifax had talks with the Italian Ambassador Grandi and the French Ambassador Corbin yesterday. In the weeks following the meeting, further talks are expected to be held to discuss ways to resolve the disputes between France and Italy. Although the Italian Embassy issued a statement, saying that Ambassador Grandi's visit to Foreign Secretary Halifax was for ordinary matters, most people still believe that this trip was related to the French-Italian problems, and that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had asked Britain to mediate between France and Italy. Italy has decided not to formally make any demands on the French island of Corsica and the port of Nice. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<h3>Stalin's Report (Continued)</h3>
<p>"The most important event that occurred during the period we are now reviewing is sufficient to show that a new imperialist war has already begun. I will describe it as follows:</p>
<p>In 1935, Italy attacked and occupied Abyssinia. In 1936, Germany and Italy began armed intervention in Spain. Germany established its rule in northern Spain and Spanish Morocco, while Italy established its rule in southern Spain and the Balearic Islands. In 1937, after occupying Manchuria, Japan further invaded North and Central China, occupied Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and began to squeeze out competitors from the occupied areas. In early 1938, Germany occupied Austria, and in the autumn, it seized the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. At the end of the same year, Japan occupied Guangzhou. In early 1939, it occupied Hainan Island. This gradually spreading war has gradually brought more than 500 million people into its circle, extending from Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou through Abyssinia to the Strait of Gibraltar. After the First Imperialist War, the victorious countries, mainly Britain, the United States, and France, established a new international relations system, namely the post-war peace system. The main pillars of this system were the Nine-Power Treaty in the Far East, the Treaty of Versailles in Europe, and other treaties. In this system, the League of Nations should adjust relations between countries based on the principle of a united front of countries and collective security. However, individual aggressive countries and the imperialist wars they launched have completely overturned this post-war peace system. Japan has torn up the Nine-Power Treaty, and Germany and Italy have torn up the Treaty of Versailles. In order to act freely, they have also withdrawn from the League of Nations. Thus, a new imperialist war has become a reality.</p>
<p>It is not easy to suddenly join the war today, regardless of any treaties. Bourgeois politicians know this well, as do the fascist leaders. Therefore, before launching the war, these fascist leaders tried to instigate public opinion, deceive it, and lead it astray in order to achieve their own goals.</p>
<p>"If they say, do the German-Italian military groups oppose the interests of Britain and France in Europe? How can this be? 'We' do not have any military groups. 'We' only have a harmless 'Berlin-Rome Axis,' which is just some kind of geometric formula about an axis (laughter). Do the German-Italian-Japanese military groups oppose the interests of the United States, Britain, and France in the Far East? How can this be? 'We' have absolutely no military groups, only a harmless 'Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Triangle,' which is just a matter of geometric inclination (whole audience laughs). A war of aggression against the interests of the United States, Britain, and France? Absolutely not. 'We' are only engaged in the anti-Comintern war, and have absolutely no intention of antagonizing the above-mentioned countries. If you don't believe it, you can read the 'Comintern Pact' concluded by Germany, Italy, and Japan."</p>
<p>"When the aggressor countries deceive public opinion, what they think and say is as described above. The clumsiness and boredom of this kind of disguise are extremely easy to see through. Searching for the 'center' of the Comintern in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia, the mountains of Abyssinia, and the wilderness of Spanish Morocco is absurd and outrageous (laughter). War is a stubborn and persistent thing, and it can never be hidden behind a veil. Any 'axis,' 'triangle,' and 'anti-Comintern pact' cannot conceal the following facts: during this period, Japan has seized large areas of China, Italy has seized Abyssinia, Germany has seized Austria and the Sudetenland, and Germany and Italy have jointly seized Spain. All of this is in violation of the interests of non-aggressive countries. War is still war, a military group of aggressor countries is still a military group, and an aggressor country is still an aggressor country.</p>
<p>"The characteristic of the new imperialist war is that this war has not yet been generalized. The war of the aggressor countries infringes upon the rights and interests of non-aggressive countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, while the latter retreat step by step. Open actions of redistributing the world and dividing spheres of influence are underway, attacking the interests of non-aggressive countries, while the latter not only do not resist, but even indulge in such behavior. It can be said to be strange, but it is also a fact."</p>
<p>"How can this strange and special phenomenon of the new imperialist war be explained? The non-aggressive countries originally have all the capabilities, but they have no resistance and give up their original positions in order to please the aggressor countries. How is this situation possible? Is it because the national strength of the non-aggressive countries is insufficient? Of course not. The combined power of the non-aggressive countries undoubtedly far exceeds that of the aggressor countries, both economically and militarily. If so, how should their systematic concessions to the aggressor countries be properly explained? They may be afraid that the outbreak of a large-scale war will spread globally, and that after being thrown into the vortex, revolutionary movements will erupt. Bourgeois politicians know that the First World War caused the revolutionary victory in one of the largest countries in the world. They are very afraid that the Second World War will cause the revolution to break out and succeed in other countries.</p>
<p>"But at present, the above explanation is not the only and not the main reason. The main reason is that the non-aggressive countries, especially Britain and France, have abandoned their collective security policy and adopted a policy of non-interference and neutrality. Formally speaking, the policy of non-interference can be explained as follows: 'Let each country work hard to protect itself and resist aggression. We don't have to intervene. We may as well trade with both the aggressor countries and the invaded countries at the same time.' In fact, the policy of non-interference is equivalent to condoning aggression and encouraging war. Therefore, it is equivalent to changing aggression into a world war. The policy of non-interference includes the desire to allow aggression, not wanting to stop the aggressor countries' robbery, not wanting to stop Japan's war against China, or better, the war against the Soviet Union, not wanting to prevent Germany from creating European incidents, or the war against the Soviet Union, letting the warring countries sink into the quagmire of war, encouraging them to go this way, letting them exhaust their own strength, and then intervening with all their strength after they have exhausted themselves, 'maintaining peace,' and freely controlling the exhausted warring countries, gaining more profits and saving effort (to be continued)."</p>
<h3>American Munitions No Longer Shipped to Japan; British and French Purchases Predominate; American Isolationists Increasingly Lose Ground</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States' active aid to various democratic countries can be clearly seen in the figures for munitions and aircraft exports for February of this year. According to official statistics, the actual number of munitions and aircraft exported in that month was worth a total of $6,425,077. Of this, $1,920,551 was shipped to France, $1,871,000 to the United Kingdom, and $1,239,709 to the Netherlands. Smaller amounts went to Peru, Colombia, Brazil, China, and Czechoslovakia. Also, in that month, munitions merchants applied to the State Department for export licenses for a total value of $16,239,396. Of this, aircraft destined for the United Kingdom accounted for $7,115,600, aircraft for France accounted for $5,000,000, and munitions for China accounted for $17,299. However, none were destined for Japan. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(New York) The idea that the United States should aid the democratic countries in a concrete way should they be at war with totalitarian countries is gaining increasing approval in American public opinion. This can be seen in the results of a public opinion poll conducted by the Public Opinion Research Institute. The institute posed several questions, including: "If war breaks out in Europe, should our country sell food to Britain and France?" The number of affirmative answers accounted for 76 percent of the total. The second question was: "If war breaks out in Europe, should our country sell arms to Britain and France?" The number of affirmative answers accounted for 52 percent. The third question was: "Should our country send naval and ground forces to aid the democratic countries?" The number of negative answers accounted for 83 percent. However, those advocating aid to the totalitarian countries accounted for only 1 percent. Prior to the Munich Agreement, half a month ago, the majority of Americans were unwilling to sell arms to the democratic countries. Now, those who favor it are in the majority, which shows that President Roosevelt's current policies are supported by the majority of the people. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Killing of Chinese in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Japanese authorities in Guangzhou have strengthened street patrols, intensified searches of pedestrians, and suddenly searched residents' homes. According to reliable sources, more than a hundred people have been arrested in recent days. Among them, forty-one were convicted of armed robbery or theft. After being paraded through the main streets in military trucks, they were subjected to the first group execution since the fall of Guangzhou. Japanese sentries search pedestrians, feeling all over their bodies regardless of gender, women included, receiving no better treatment than men. Even items in pockets must be taken out for inspection. The authorities have recently announced the levy of a "police tax" to maintain the city's increasing police force. All shops must pay this tax according to the nature and scope of their business, with higher turnover resulting in heavier taxes. According to the "authorities'" regulations, shops must pay a monthly tax ranging from twenty cents to several yuan. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) In order to stabilize public morale, the Japanese side has issued a semi-official explanation for the artillery fire frequently heard at night, stating that the Japanese army is test-firing heavy artillery left behind by the Chinese army during its retreat last year to see if it is still useful, hence the artillery fire. The Japanese side also denies that the Japanese army in the outskirts of Guangzhou is under heavy pressure from Chinese guerrillas, saying that the area around the city is safe, as evidenced by the many Chinese who travel by water and land to and from neighboring villages. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Chinese police here carry only batons and no firearms, and are therefore unable to cope with armed bandits. The Maintenance Association has now decided to add 500 police officers and has issued a public notice instructing former police officers to register. It is reported that the newly recruited police officers will be trained by the Japanese. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>All Teachers and Students of the Sichen School Participate in the War of Resistance; Their Loyalty, Bravery, and Heroism are Unprecedented</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A truce. During the recent Japanese invasion of southern Hebei, the staff and students of the "Sichen School," as weak and scholarly youths, fought a desperate battle against the Japanese army. Their deeds are enough to move ghosts and gods to tears and terrify the Japanese army. At 2 PM on the 15th of last month, about two or three hundred Japanese and puppet troops, consisting of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, attacked the Zhao Jiaquan and Li Jia Dian area of Hengshui, where the "Sichen School" was stationed. The staff and students of the school immediately engaged the Japanese army with rifles. The Japanese army then infiltrated the villages, and the school staff threw hand grenades from the rooftops, killing fifty or sixty Japanese soldiers and destroying three vehicles. The Japanese army collapsed and retreated to outside the villages, and the school staff and students immediately chased them down, resulting in fierce street fighting. Although the Japanese army relied on superior weapons to launch a fierce attack, they were ultimately repelled by the generous and courageous spirit of the students. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce artillery attack on the students. After three or four hours of fierce fighting, the students ran out of ammunition and launched a charge. Most of the students in the school were underage youths, and some of the younger ones were unable to follow the charge. The staff and students who did break out returned to charge and kill, and finally broke out completely at 12:30 AM. The staff and students, due to their strong blood and energy, often snatched guns with their bare hands, but the disparity in numbers was too great, and the equipment was too inferior, so the casualties were quite heavy. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed and five Japanese vehicles were destroyed. Five teachers, including Wang Jieliang, and thirty-two students were injured. Two teachers and eleven students were killed in action. Since the July 7th Incident, there have been very few schools in the country that have participated in the War of Resistance as fully as the "Sichen School." Furthermore, their loyalty, bravery, and heroism are worthy of being a model for teachers and students across the country. The government has given preferential treatment to the school's teachers and students in terms of awards and pensions. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Frenziedly Bomb Luoyang Twice</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) From 11 AM to 11:30 AM this morning, Japanese planes frenziedly bombed Luoyang twice. The first time, there were seven Japanese planes, and the second time, there were nine.

When the Japanese planes dropped bombs today, they also dropped 40 or so stones the size of washbasins. This action is not only shameless on the part of the Japanese, but also a testament to the fact that the Japanese are running out of bombs. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Special Telegram from our Newspaper in Hong Kong. In today's age of aviation, military national defense certainly requires the construction of air defenses, and economic national defense also requires the development of aviation transportation. China is currently in a period of resistance against Japan, and the authorities are catching up in the construction of military air defenses. The later stages of the war of resistance have begun, and future victories are drawing closer. In the near future, a newly emerging China will need to alleviate transportation difficulties and establish close ties with the business communities of various countries around the world. Currently, international air routes of companies such as China National Aviation Corporation and Pan American Airways have already connected with China, and transportation between Europe and the United States is instantaneous. Aviation business will naturally play a very important role in transportation in the future. Chinese entrepreneurs who want to gain a foothold in international commerce in the future must prepare in advance, and the cultivation of aviation talent should be undertaken at this time. Chinese youth should also devote themselves to this promising career. Yesterday, the reporter visited the only fully equipped Far East Aviation School in Hong Kong and learned about the various conditions of the school, which can serve as a reference for China's aviation industry and as a research topic for aspiring young people. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sino-British Cooperation. The school site is located at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, covering approximately 150 acres, located on the Kun Lian Bay between Hong Kong and Kowloon, making it an excellent seaplane base. The aviation school was established in the spring of 1934, with the aim of providing aviation training to people in the Far East. It is stipulated that this training is the same as that received by pilots and mechanics in the British Royal Air Force, and that they have the opportunity to take the British government-issued aviation license. The students recruited are of all nationalities. The school has contracts with the Chinese National Government, the British Aviation Department, the Hong Kong Government, and Imperial Airways (Far East), and is organized as a limited company.</p>
<p>Well-Equipped. The directors of the school are Messrs. Dunson, Smith, Morrison, and Smithers. The director of the Flight Department is Major Smithers, an officer of the American Royal Air Force. The director of the Mechanical Department is Mr. Nero of the Royal Air Force British Aeronautical Engineering Society. The school's curriculum focuses on ground training, and classrooms and local repair work are all carried out on campus. Therefore, students can personally see the engine and various parts of the aircraft they are riding in, which is a kind of training that is not easily obtained by general aviation trainees.</p>
<p>Admission Qualifications. The admission procedure requires that applicants be at least 17 years old, have received considerable general education, and those applying for the Mechanical Department will be given an oral test by the Director of the Mechanical Department. If they do not have sufficient academic discussion, they must also take introductory arithmetic in the first semester. Those applying for the Flight Department can apply for admission at any time. A physical examination is conducted first, and female students are also accepted. If students do not have sufficient English proficiency, they can also take the exam in Chinese. The school employs Chinese assistants and interpreters to translate and assist with lectures during class. Those who have a little English proficiency will not find it difficult to understand. In the event that there are flight trainees who are not proficient in English, the Chinese assistant can re-explain after the flight is completed.</p>
<p>Class Arrangement. The Mechanical Department divides the year into four semesters: January to March, April to June, July to September, and October to December. Classes are usually held from 8 AM to 1 PM. Flight Department classes are held from Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 12:30 PM and 2 PM to 5 PM, and Saturday, 9 AM to 12:30 PM. While in school, trainees must strictly abide by school rules, especially flight orders, which must be carefully observed.</p>
<p>Flight Training. A. Flight Department. The first course is for those preparing to obtain a British private pilot's license, and stipulates 12 hours of primary and advanced variable person training and 3 hours of solo flight. The second course is the primary military flight course, with a training period of four to six months. The training is exactly the same as that of the British Air Force. The teaching procedure includes passenger flight, taxiing techniques, and methods of using aircraft, straight flight, upwind takeoff, medium turn, gliding turn, sharp turn, primary and advanced forced landing, actions in the event of a fire, aerobatics, passenger testing, blind flight, and other 27 items. The third course is the blind flight course, the fourth course is the light aircraft flight instructor course, the fifth course is the intermediate aircraft and aerobatic aircraft instructor course, the sixth course is the advanced aerobatics course, and the seventh course (preparing to take the British Class B pilot's license) seventh course A, commercial pilot and full mechanical course.</p>
<p>Mechanical Learning. B. Mechanical Department. The eighth and ninth courses are the aircraft mechanical courses, with a longer learning time of about two years. The first semester is a three-month internship in primary wood construction, the second semester is a three-month internship in real metal construction, the third semester is a three-month internship in advanced wood construction, the fourth semester is a three-month internship in advanced metal construction, the fifth and sixth semesters are a six-month internship in internal combustion engines, and the seventh semester is a three-month internship in airframe storage methods. The tenth course is the handling of parachutes, and the eleventh course is the high-pressure aircraft... mixing.</p>
<p>Equivalent to Studying Abroad. If one can complete all the courses in the Flight Department or Mechanical Department, it is the same as spending a lot of money to go abroad to an aviation school in the UK, and their academic ability is almost equal to that of British Air Force personnel. The school also makes every effort to help graduates find employment after obtaining their licenses. The tuition fees are as follows: A. Flight Department, the first course is HK$ (hereinafter, all amounts are in HK$) 750, the first course is HK$4,260, the third course is HK$600, the fourth course is HK$500, the fifth course is HK$900, the sixth course is HK$600, the seventh course is HK$7,000, and the seventh course A is HK$9,800. B. Mechanical Department, the eighth course is HK$100 per month, the ninth course is HK$100 per month, the tenth course is HK$200, and the eleventh course is HK$350. If there are exchange rate fluctuations, the amounts will be calculated and confirmed temporarily.</p>

<h3>Puppet Troops of Yangzhou Carry Weapons and Surrender</h3>
<p>Taixian Dispatch. The puppet troops of the Yangzhou Pacification Army, suffering too much oppression from the Japanese army, have come to realize their mistake. On the night of February 22nd, a group of about a hundred of them escaped with their weapons and headed northwest. It is reported that they have surrendered to the Hua Army × Unit and returned to the right path. The Japanese army in Yangzhou is now afraid that the puppet troops will escape again, so they have recently increased their defenses.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Establishes a Trade Bureau to Manage Goods</h3>
<p>Yongkang Dispatch. In order to manage the import and export trade of the province and increase financial income, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has submitted a proposal to the Provincial Government Meeting to establish the Zhejiang Provincial Trade Bureau. Huang Zupei, Director of the Department of Finance, is concurrently the manager, and Xu Enpei, Director of the Zhejiang Local Bank, is concurrently the deputy manager. The bureau will have a general affairs department, a business department, and an accounting office. The bureau will be organized and established this month and will begin work. It is reported that it will start with the management of imports.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Construction Department Formulates Measures to Manage Spring Silkworm Eggs</h3>
<p>Lishui Dispatch. As Zhejiang Province is a silk-producing area, and since western Zhejiang, including Hangzhou and Jiaxing, has fallen into guerrilla areas, there are still many sericulture counties in eastern Zhejiang. With the end of winter and the approach of early spring, the time for sericulture is approaching in the blink of an eye. In order to consider adjusting the needs of silkworm farmers for silkworm eggs in the spring of the 28th year, the Zhejiang Construction Department has specially formulated management measures for spring silkworm eggs, which are managed by the Silkworm Egg Inspection Office established by the affiliated Agricultural Improvement Institute. The silkworm eggs produced in various egg-producing places for the spring of the 28th year will be purchased by the institute at a price, which is set at sixty cents per silkworm egg sheet. Sixteen million sheets have been ordered from various fields. One ocean and one corner will be paid first for each sheet, two corners and seven points will be paid after the silkworm eggs are handed over, and the remaining two corners and three points will be paid after the orchid collection is completed. Silkworm farmers in various places who need silkworm eggs must order them from the various silkworm industry improvement areas or the county governments of each county. The price per silkworm egg sheet is set at four corners. The seed money will be collected at three corners when the seed is ordered, and the remaining one corner will be paid when the seed is issued. Those who sell silkworm eggs will receive a handling fee of three points per sheet, which will be deducted from the number when the ordering unit submits the seed money for distribution. The number of silkworm egg sheets ordered and the seed money in various places must be sent to the designated location of the Improvement Institute before March 25. Silkworm egg farms that wish to sell their silkworm eggs directly to various silkworm areas must first report to the Improvement Institute for record. The seed money shall be handled by the farm itself. When silkworm eggs from other provinces are imported, they must also be reported to the Improvement Institute in advance, and they can only be distributed to silkworm farmers for breeding after being verified. Currently, various counties have separately requested to register, including 60,000 sheets in the guerrilla area, 60,000 sheets in Zhuji, and 42,000 sheets in Sheng County, totaling more than 230,000 sheets, which are still waiting for overall planning, distribution, and issuance.</p>

<h3>Charity Football Match Ends: Donghua Loses to Portugal Yesterday, 1-3; Donghua's Left Wing Too Weak; Zhu Hongyi Purchases Third Ball for 600 Yuan</h3>
<p>After days of continuous spring rain, the sun shone brightly yesterday morning. The third charity football match, organized by the Shanghai International Relief Committee and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, between Donghua and Portugal, was held at Yiyuan at 10:30 AM. The French Army band came to the field to play music, and the fans were enthusiastic about the charity, with no fewer than 5,000 people attending, making the atmosphere more lively than the second match. The Portuguese team had a well-organized lineup, with many veteran players, making their victory expected. Donghua, on the other hand, suffered a great loss in left-wing strength due to the absence of key player Wan Xianghua. As a result, they were defeated by the Portuguese, losing 1-3. They were behind 1-2 in the first half. Donghua's defeat was undeniably due to the weakness of the left wing, Wan Jin and Sun Huizhang. They missed countless good opportunities, and Dai Linjing repeatedly passed the ball to the left wing, which was a huge mistake. Portuguese defender Masan'er was incredibly strong, and Donghua frequently ran into a wall against him. Costa's center back played both offense and defense, which was quite formidable. For Donghua, Dai Linjing and Jia Youliang performed the best, but unfortunately, they lacked coordination. The team's effort was commendable, but playing football in the mud was not easy. Zhou Dayun was injured in the hand shortly after the start of the game, which hindered his movements, making it difficult to cope. Fa Fanxiao scored the first goal after contact, and Dai Linjing equalized. Fa Fanxiao scored again, and the Portuguese team took the lead 2-1 in the first half. After switching sides, the competition was fierce. Donghua was slightly negligent and Remy Di scored a goal. In the end, Donghua had many good chances, but they all missed. As a result, they lost 1-3. Yesterday, Mr. Pan Lidi, the commander of the French Army stationed in Shanghai, came to the field to kick off the game and, during the break, presented the previous match ball to Mr. Pu Zaiyuan, who bid 500 yuan. After the game, the third ball was auctioned off and purchased by printer Zhu Hongyi for 600 yuan. Yesterday, 2,498 yuan was sold in temporary tickets, and about 3,000 yuan was obtained including pre-sales. The lineups of both sides in yesterday's game are as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Association</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun, Zhuang Youren, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Xu Chengdong, Cai Shengsen, Shu Shigeng, Wan Jin, Sun Huizhang, Dai Linjing, Shen Shiyan, Jia Youliang</p>

<p>When the time came, the referee Zhang Le and Mr. Pan Lidi, commander of the French Army stationed in Shanghai, accompanied by Mr. Li Guiyong, a member of the Standing Committee of the International Relief Committee, entered the field to the sound of military music and kicked the ball, starting the battle. Donghua got the ball and attacked first. Wan Jin went deep but was blocked. Sun Huizhang got the ball from the back and passed it to Dai Linjing. Dai kicked the ball towards the goal, but Rocha Liao caught it and threw it out. Oliveira passed the ball far forward, but Fa Fanxiao and Rocha Liao both missed. Zhuang Youren calmly kicked it out. Soon after, Sun Huizhang and Dai Linjing advanced side by side, but due to the wet and slippery ground, they were unable to shoot and were saved by Victor Tai, with no success. Fa Fanxiao attacked from the middle, and Zhuang Youren rushed to the rescue without error. Remy Di then attacked from the right and passed to Kola Sha, who crossed the ball. Fa Fanxiao headed the ball, but it went over the crossbar. After fifteen minutes, Rocha Liao attacked the goal. Although Zhou Dayun saved the ball, he injured his hand. The game was suspended for a moment, and then continued. Both sides remained evenly matched, with no score after twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Portuguese Lead 2-1</p>
<p>After twenty-two minutes, Laurel hooked the ball from the left. Zhou Dayun pushed it out not far enough, and Fa Fanxiao rushed up and shot hard. Dayun was unable to save it, and Donghua conceded the first goal. In less than two minutes, Jia Youliang received a pass from Sun Huizhang and crossed the ball. Dai Linjing saw an opportunity and swept the ball from fifteen yards away, equalizing the score. What was gained easily was also lost easily. Two minutes later, Fa Fanxiao scored again on his own, and the Portuguese team took the lead again. Donghua counterattacked. Wan Jin dribbled the ball deep, but Victor Tai blocked it, resulting in a corner kick. Wan's kick was ineffective. After Rocha Liao shot wildly, Su Ruo committed a foul. Jia Youliang took a free kick, and Mayuer headed the ball out. Fa Fanxiao's attack was caught, and he came back again. Dayun caught and patted the ball, turning the danger into safety. Wan Jin's attack was unsuccessful. Remy Di dribbled and hooked the ball, fortunately hitting the goal post. Wan Jin rose again, passed Victor Tai, and crossed the ball. Ah Dai missed his footing, and Shen Shiyan passed the ball to Jia Youliang. Jia shot angrily, but Rocha Liao dived and saved it. Sun Huizhang rushed up to meet it, but unfortunately, the ground was slippery and he could not control it, losing a good opportunity. Everyone stomped their feet. Xu Chengdong passed the ball far. Ah Dai headed the ball, and Huizhang kicked it towards the goal but it was caught. Kola Sha shot twice, but both were ineffective. As a result of the first half, the Portuguese team led 2-1.</p>
<p>Another Goal Lost</p>
<p>After the break, Costa passed the ball to Kola Sha. Jiang Zhaoxiang blocked his path. Fa Fanxiao rushed forward, but committed a foul. The ball was then passed out from Donghua's position. Linjing passed the ball to Wan Jin, who kicked it towards the goal, but Rocha Liao jumped and caught it. Su Ruo shot the ball far, but Dayun pressed it down. Ah Dai rushed into the enemy camp and shot from the right. The ball passed in front of the goal. Wan Jin pressed it down and swept it, but Rocha Liao knelt down and saved it. Kola Sha dribbled the ball and rushed over. Zhuang Youren blocked it, resulting in a corner kick. Remy Di kicked it very well, and Xu Chengdong headed the ball out of danger. Laurel attacked the goal, Dayun caught it and slid down, fortunately no one rushed in. He picked it up again and threw it out. After twenty-one minutes, Kola Sha scored with the help of Fa Fanxiao, but he was offside and the goal was disallowed. The Portuguese team was unwilling to give up and launched another fierce attack. Five minutes later, Fa Fanxiao broke through in the middle, but Zhuang Youren failed to block him. The ball fell to Remy Di's feet, who shot quickly and scored a goal. Donghua tried hard to counterattack, with great momentum. Jia Youliang continued to pick the ball up, but Sun Huizhang and Wan Jin both shot wide, missing good opportunities. Finally, Fa Fanxiao shot over the crossbar, Costa hit the goal post, and the silver whistle blew for a long time. The Portuguese team defeated Donghua 3-1, and the charity match ended.</p>

<h3>Education News: The Puppet Regime Falsely Uses the Name of the Youth League to Privately Recruit Students from Various Schools; School Authorities Have Strictly Paid Attention</h3>
<p>Since the Central Government promulgated the organizational methods of the Three Principles of the People Youth League, various places have successively proceeded with its organization. In this city, because of the large number of student youths, the Central Government also plans to send personnel to Shanghai to organize it. However, at present, it is still in the preparation stage and has not actually started working. Recently, various schools have suddenly discovered that the puppet regime is also using the name of the Youth League to privately contact and recruit students from various schools, which is obviously for other purposes. The schools have already strictly taken precautions. Once the Central Government officially sends personnel to Shanghai, they will naturally strive to promote it.</p>
<h3>Chen Lijiang Discusses China's Education in the Past Year (3): The Ferocity of Destruction Has Fueled the Courageous and Diligent Efforts of This Year, Laying a Solid Foundation</h3>
<p>(E) Other Reforms and Progress (1) "The Ministry of Education Added Various Educational Design and Research Organizations." The Ministry of Education added various committees in the morning, such as the Wartime Education Problem Research Committee, the Agricultural Education Research Committee, the Industrial Education Research Committee, and the Music Education Committee. These are all important design and research organizations. For the planning and improvement of various educations, indelible achievements have been demonstrated in this year. (2) "The New Facilities of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee," such as subsidizing scientific workers, subsidizing education in the Northwest, and rewarding scientific research, are all far-sighted measures. (3) "The Organization of the Three Principles of the People Youth League." In June of last year, President Chiang led the organization of the Three Principles of the People Youth League for the training of a large number of youths, and served as the leader of the League. Now it has a thorough and strong meaning. (4) "The Implementation of Concentrated Military Training for Female Students." In the past, high school students and above were concentrated for military training, and female students were allowed to be exempt. Since the morning's concentrated training, female students have also participated across the board. Therefore, female students in high schools and above have since obtained specialized skills such as military affairs and nursing. (G) Furthermore, in terms of social dynamics, there are also many reforms and progress as follows: (1) "The Booming of Wartime Education Publications." Wartime education publications have sprung up everywhere this year. In terms of magazines, educational magazines, teaching and learning, and educational research are all magazines that publish articles on wartime education. In addition to this, there are new magazines such as Education Newsletter, This, Balance, and Wartime Education, which were all produced during this year. In terms of books, there are countless pamphlets published this year, especially popular educational readings. The Popular Series for the People in the Emergency Period by the Zhengzhong Bookstore (compiled by the Popular Reading Materials Committee of the Ministry of Education), the Anti-Japanese War Education Series by the Commercial Press, the Wartime Popular Readings by the Life Bookstore (edited by the Popular Readings Compilation and Publication Society), and the Farmers' Anti-Japanese War Series by the Ping Church are only the authors. (2) "Unprecedented Progress and Unity of Chinese Educational Academic Groups." The work of Chinese educational academic groups last year saw unprecedented progress, and there was also unprecedented unity between the various academic groups. (3) "The Establishment and Development of Wartime Education and Cultural Groups." Many wartime education and cultural groups were established last year, such as the Wartime Children's Protection Association, the National Wartime Education Association, the China Wartime Children's Relief Association, and the National Literary and Art Circles Anti-Enemy Association, all of which were established last year, and developed practical and urgent wartime education work. (4) "The Flourishing Development of Mass Training and Women's Training, and the Vigorous Development of Singing and Drama." Everywhere last year, various mass training and women's training activities, as well as the rise of singing and drama groups, could be seen. (5) "The Conduct of Academic Research." Although in the difficult environment of the War of Resistance, academic research was not slackened. All of this is enough to prove the progress of education last year and the greatness of its strength. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Promoting Family Education: Various Schools Form Promotion Associations</h3>
<p>In order to improve the lives of the general public and increase the strength of the War of Resistance and national construction, the Ministry of Education has formulated measures for middle schools and below to promote family education, and has ordered the education authorities of various provinces and cities to instruct all schools to comply. It is reported that after receiving this instruction, the principals of various schools in this city discussed the promotion measures a few days ago, and decided that each school should establish a Family Education Promotion Committee based on the circumstances, and a general office should be jointly established by each school to exchange opinions at any time. The promotion measures will not only be handled in accordance with the special rules promulgated by the Ministry, but the general office will also formulate detailed rules and distribute them to various schools for implementation. It is heard that the promotion is being carried out very actively these days.</p>
<h3>Soochow University School Buildings Returned to Owners: Huge Losses; Jinghai School Buildings Also Returned</h3>
<p>The Mainland Newspaper reported that Soochow University in Suzhou was returned to its original American owners last Thursday after being occupied by the Japanese military authorities for 17 months. It was discovered that the property losses were huge. This time, the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church regained control of the school. A large number of equipment in the school, except for those that had been shipped out, had been destroyed. Not only was the valuable laboratory equipment stolen, but also the heavy furniture and pianos were stolen. The above was stated by Dr. William, a staff member of the school, when he met with reporters last night. He was also present at the scene when the school buildings were taken over. Dr. William also said that the Academy of Sciences of Dongda suffered the greatest losses. Medical equipment was completely stolen, and very little equipment was left in other parts. Most of the scientific equipment was ordered from the United States, and the cost of replacing it was huge. Suzhou Yinghai Women's Normal School was also returned at the same time as Soochow University. The losses of the two schools were quite similar. Six staff members of Dongda and one representative of the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church, the original owner of the property, went to Suzhou last Sunday to prepare for the takeover of the school. The Japanese army finally handed over the property with a very good attitude and cooperated with us. They and a group of Japanese soldiers inspected the entire school on Sunday to determine which property belonged to the school and which belonged to the Japanese army. This work went smoothly. The representative of the Japanese army was Captain Takahashi. On Tuesday and Wednesday, they repeatedly entered the school buildings to arrange everything, and on Thursday, the Japanese army completely withdrew. Dr. William also said that although there were no problems during the takeover, the property had been gradually damaged since Suzhou fell and the property was occupied, mostly because the buildings were not repaired after being damaged. Water was still accumulated in the classrooms that had been hit by bombs. Only two buildings were actually hit during the air raids. In addition to the quite valuable and lighter equipment being stolen or destroyed, a large amount of heavy property such as furniture was also transported away. After the fall of Suzhou, Dongda was occupied almost immediately. Even if some local Chinese stole the equipment in the school before it fell, they would not have stolen things like pianos. It will take a long time to repair the damaged property now, and the cost of replacing the equipment is huge. Professor Xilai is now staying in Suzhou to assist in the repair and cleaning of the school buildings. According to reports, Dongda was occupied in November 1937. During the 17 months that the Japanese army controlled the school, it was mostly used as a military hospital. On January 15 last year, Bishop Moore of the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church and several other Americans were allowed by the Japanese army to visit the property. At that time, it was discovered that the school had suffered losses and damage. Thereafter, it was not until August 30 that foreigners were allowed to visit the library and the Academy of Sciences and transport out many books. The remaining scientific equipment was all stored. After that, the original owner of the school could occasionally visit. Last autumn, the Japanese army agreed to return the school by the end of February, which was implemented last Thursday. According to reports, Dongda was founded in 1930 by the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church. After the outbreak of the war, it moved to Tunxi, Anhui Province, and then returned to Shanghai. It is now holding classes in the Cishu Building.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Difficult-to-Educate Expenses: Achievements of Various Schools</h3>
<p>Qinghua Primary and Secondary School: Qinghua Primary and Secondary School, No. 428 Baike Road, has always been enthusiastic about various charitable activities. This time, they have done their best to support the Refugee Relief Association's Education Group in raising funds for production education. After days of active promotion, the achievements are remarkable. It is heard that they have now raised 1,208 yuan in national currency. Among them, the most donations were from Li Weicheng of Middle School 2 Autumn (50 yuan), Chen Zongqiu (30 yuan), Liang Huifu and Chen Yaoxi (21 yuan each), Wu Pinji and Han Renkuan of Middle School 3, Ying Rende and Chen Hongzhi of Middle School 2 Autumn, Sheng Yuping and Hu Dingdao of Middle School 1 Autumn, Yao Maozong of Elementary School 5 Autumn, and Sheng Yulong of Elementary School 3 Spring (20 yuan each). All donations have been uniformly submitted to the Shanghai Bank for collection.</p>
<p>Early Spring Primary School: Early Spring Primary School and Kindergarten have always been enthusiastic about charitable activities.

<h3>Wartime Shanghai Financial Market</h3>
<p>— Zhu Boquan</p>
<p>Regarding Shanghai's wartime finance, numerous commentators in this publication have already expressed their views. Now, we are pleased to receive a learned article from Mr. Zhu Boquan. Mr. Zhu's position in the domestic financial world is, I believe, well-known to our readers. His observations on the dynamics of Shanghai's wartime financial market, seen through the eyes of an industry insider, are naturally more profound than those of the average person. The comprehensiveness is only secondary. Therefore, without concern for repetition, we are publishing it with haste, hoping it will capture the readers' attention. — The Editor</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>Shanghai is the great port for foreign exchange in our country, holding the financial heart of the nation. According to various statistics, as of the end of June 1937, the banks in Shanghai accounted for over 32% of the total number of banks in the country (excluding branch banks). Among them, the paid-up capital of the 41 member banks accounted for 45% of the total paid-up capital of all banks in the country, and their total assets accounted for 44.5% of the national total. Various deposits also accounted for about 76% of the total bank deposits in the country, excluding the Central Bank and other non-member banks. In addition, there were also foreign banks, native banks, trust companies, silver companies, savings societies, and other financial institutions. Among them, foreign banks and native banks have a long history and deep influence in the Shanghai financial market, forming a tripartite balance with Chinese banks.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Shanghai financial community has endured many hardships, so it has strived to improve. For example, after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the Shanghai banking and money industries successively formed the Joint Reserve Board. Later, the banking industry established the Clearing House and the Acceptance House, making the unity firmer and the strength more abundant. In November 1935, the currency system was reformed, concentrating the nation's economic lifeblood of silver and unifying the issuance of currency, making the financial foundation more stable. This achievement had already demonstrated its effectiveness before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and its value was fully proven during the war.</p>
<p>II. The Financial Market Before and After the Outbreak of War</p>
<p>In the first half of 1937, the general domestic economic situation showed a booming atmosphere. Since the currency reform in 1935, general prices began to rise. Stimulated by rising prices, industry and commerce were thriving. Transactions in various markets were frequent, which was rare in recent years. In the first half of 1937, the total amount of Shanghai bank note exchange increased by about one-sixth compared with the same period last year, and the financial situation was also extremely stable. The interbank lending rate hovered around 10% consistently. The foreign exchange market has always been controlled by government banks, with exceptional stability. The public debt market price reached over 89 yuan in June. The deposit and loan business of the financial industry also increased consistently. Unexpectedly, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out, shocking the market. The Shanghai Hongqiao Airport incident followed, and a full-scale war between China and Japan was launched.</p>
<p>After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out, the first to be affected was the financial community in Shanghai. The public debt market price dropped sharply after July 7th. It was common for the exchange to suspend trading several times a day. Until the settlement period in July, the government stipulated a minimum price of 70 yuan, and it was then calmed. At that time, those who suspected legal tender were already withdrawing their deposits one after another, purchasing foreign exchange or transferring them to foreign banks. The number of capital flight was huge. In early August, the situation in Shanghai became more serious, and the trend of withdrawals became even more intense. When the August 13th Shanghai Battle broke out, Shanghai suddenly became a war zone, and people's hearts were panicked and uncontrollable. All exchanges were the first to suspend trading, and the banking and money industries were also ordered to suspend business for four days from August 13th. In order to maintain finance, the Ministry of Finance specially announced measures to stabilize finance, restricting withdrawals and deposits. At the same time, the banking and money industries formulated supplementary measures, utilizing the exchange system to determine the method of bill remittance. The financial panic began to be alleviated. From August 17th, the banking and money industries resumed business uniformly. Although there were still many people who asked to withdraw deposits, they were limited to a certain extent. Moreover, since the four government banks and the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry had methods to regulate the industry, they were able to cope with ease, and people's hearts also became more stable. By the end of the year, many depositors in various banks and native banks had re-deposited the money they had previously withdrawn. According to the financial stabilization measures of the Ministry of Finance, those who deposited legal tender into banks and native banks or established new accounts after the war could withdraw legal tender at any time without restriction. At the same time, wartime current deposits could be circulated through interbank remittance bills in addition to the withdrawal limit. Therefore, the deposit amount of each bank did not decrease significantly. At that time, the general situation in the market showed a deflationary trend, and credit was stagnant. Due to the obstruction of transactions, commercial exchanges between various places and Shanghai were on the verge of collapse. Almost all industries and commerce were in a state of stagnation. Moreover, due to the blockage of the source of goods, prices soared, especially for necessities such as fuel and food. However, the government has always maintained the foreign exchange rate, so it is not superficial to consolidate the credit of legal tender.</p>
<p>III. Evolution of the Wartime Financial Market</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, various financial conditions in Shanghai have generally changed with the environment, and they all have a related relationship or are mutually causal. It is not easy to analyze them. For the convenience of narration, I will try to describe the main evolutions of the financial market in the past year below:</p>
<p>(1) Interbank Remittance and Discounted Cash Exchange: Before the war, the payment tools of the Shanghai banking and money industries, in addition to legal tender cash, included two types of bills: one was a payment bill, which could be cashed on the same day and was no different from cash, and the other was a remittance bill, which could only be cashed the next day. The measures to stabilize finance stipulated that for wartime deposits of more than 300 yuan, withdrawals were limited to 5% of the deposit balance per week, with a maximum of no more than 150 yuan. At the same time, the Shanghai banking and money industries were approved by the Ministry of Finance to stipulate: "In addition to paying legal tender in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry, current deposits of each bank and native bank may be paid with interbank remittance bills for commercial needs beyond the limits stipulated by the Ministry." This kind of interbank remittance bill was only allowed to be transferred between Shanghai banks and native banks, and no legal tender was paid, and no foreign exchange could be purchased. It was completely different from the remittance bill that could be cashed the next day before the war. Its purpose was to facilitate the circulation of commercial funds and to avoid capital flight. During the January 28th Shanghai Battle, the promissory notes issued by Shanghai native banks were once suspended from being cashed the next day and were only allowed to be remitted between banks, which was similar to the current situation. According to Shanghai's industrial and commercial transactions, transfers are usually paid by transfer, and payments in legal tender are a minority. After the war, remittance bills were only allowed to be transferred between banks and could not be paid in cash, which had no impact on commercial needs. However, some foreign banks in Shanghai were unwilling to accept this kind of bill because they had no dealings with Chinese banks and native banks. In addition, general importers of foreign goods gradually became discriminatory because they could not convert foreign exchange, and some even lacked legal tender funds. In order to facilitate the use, they were often willing to exchange 100 yuan of remittance bills for 98 or 99 yuan of cash, which led to the beginning of discounted cash exchange for remittance. Generally, speculative merchants saw that there was profit to be made, and they scrambled to engage in cash exchange as a business; therefore, remittance bills became an object of trade. Initially, the discount for each thousand yuan was about 4 or 5 yuan to 10 or 20 yuan. Later, the circulation of remittance bills in the market increased, and the number of people exchanging discounted cash also increased. In addition, the population of the concessions suddenly increased, and the daily necessities needed legal tender cash. Also, after the foreign exchange control, the black market was active, and the impact was that the discount increased. By June of last year, the discount for each thousand yuan had once reached more than 70 yuan. Later, the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry came out to maintain it and made a large number of adjustments, which stabilized the discount at about 50 yuan. In November of last year, Guangzhou and Wuhan were lost one after another, and people were uneasy. Many people also exchanged remittance bills for cash to purchase foreign exchange or cash. The discount rate once rose to more than 60 yuan. Soon the war situation stabilized, and it returned to about 45 yuan. In January of this year, after the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry officially managed it by announcing the buying and selling market price every day, the discount rate has stabilized at about 35 yuan per thousand yuan, with only a few cents of rise and fall every day. In early March of this year, due to the influence of the foreign exchange and cash market, and at the same time, there was a saying in North China that the currency system would be disrupted, the discount rate announced by the Quasi-Government Association was increased to 40 yuan per thousand yuan, and soon rose to 50 yuan. At present, the market discount rate is still around 48 yuan.</p>
<p>(2) Interbank Discount and Interest Rates: After the currency reform in 1935, the government originally planned to reorganize the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank. However, the preparations were not yet mature when the Shanghai War broke out. In addition to restricting withdrawals and deposits, the Ministry of Finance ordered the four government banks, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, to organize joint offices and joint discount associations in major cities in order to unify affairs and jointly assume the responsibility of regulating finance. The Shanghai Four Bank Discount Association specializes in interbank mortgage loans and discounting of commercial bills, mainly discounting the amount of payment bills. The discounting of interbank remittance funds is entrusted by the Four Bank Discount Association to the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry to be handled together with the original various interbank lending of the association. As of the end of September of the previous year, the loans of the Discount Association totaled more than 18 million yuan, and the interbank remittance funds lent by the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry also reached about 10 million yuan. After the war, the banking and money industries were in great need of funds to prepare for withdrawals and deposits. With this assistance, they were able to cope with ease. According to the statistics at the end of June of last year, the total amount of discounting by the Four Bank Discount Associations in various places was more than 50 million yuan. As of the end of last year, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Finance, the total amount of funds discounted by the Four Banks was 89 million yuan, of which about 16 million yuan was discounted in Shanghai, accounting for about 20% of the total, which was 1 million yuan less than in September of the previous year. The amount of interbank remittance lending by the Joint Reserve Association of Shanghai Banks. As of the end of last year, it was about 5 million yuan, which was about 5 million yuan less than in September of the previous year.</p>
<p>There are two types of interbank lending rates in the Shanghai financial market: one is the interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association, which is the interest rate for lending between native banks, and the other is the interbank lending rate and discount rate of the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry, which is the interest rate for interbank lending and discounting between banks. Since the establishment of the Four Bank Discount Association, it also announces the interbank lending rate and discount rate every day, and there are three different interest rates in the Shanghai financial market.</p>
<p>The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.1% per thousand yuan per day in June and July of the previous year. In early August, due to the tightening of the situation in Shanghai, it increased every day, reaching 1.9% on the 13th, and then stabilized at 2% after the banking and money industries opened on the 17th. It dropped to 1.5% in November and December, and then dropped to 1% in January of last year, and there was no major rise or fall after that. It once rose to 1.4% in October, and then returned to normal. At present, it is hovering around 1.2%.</p>
<p>The interbank lending rate and discount rate of the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry are divided into remittance and national currency. In July of the previous year, the remittance and national currency interbank lending rates were both 1.1% per thousand yuan per day, and the discount rate was 1.2%. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War on August 13th, the national currency interbank lending rate and discount rate were 3%, and remittance also reached 2%. In October and November, the remittance interbank lending rate and discount rate dropped to 1.8%. In December, it rose to 2%. In early August of last year, the interbank lending rate and discount rate of national currency dropped to 2.5%, and there has been no change since then.</p>
<p>The discount rate opened by the Discount Association in August of the previous year was 8% per week, and the lending rate was 3% per thousand yuan per day. From August of last year, the discount rate was changed to 7.5% per week, and the lending rate was changed to 2.5% per thousand yuan per day, which was equal to the interest rate opened by the Joint Reserve Board of the banking industry.</p>
<p>From the movement of the interbank lending rate of the banking and money industries, it can be seen that the financial situation in Shanghai has gradually become relaxed from being tense. However, the above-mentioned interbank lending rate of the Money Industry seems to be lower than the interbank lending rate of the bank after the war, with a difference of almost half. The reason for this is that remittance has always been the accounting standard of the Money Industry. All remittance positions of banks have always been concentrated in the Money Industry, and the Money Industry calculates the interest rate on interbank deposits according to the interbank lending rate. If the interbank lending rate increases, then the Money Industry must increase the interest rate on interbank remittance deposits accordingly, which is equivalent to increasing the burden on the Money Industry. Moreover, after the war, remittance bills cannot be paid in cash, and the Money Industry's remittance position is more abundant than before, and it is even more unwilling to raise the interbank lending rate and increase the burden. In fact, the Money Industry's external loans are calculated at an interest rate of about 8% per month, including the average interbank lending rate per month (for example, in February of this year, the monthly difference of the Money Industry's interbank lending rate is 3 yuan plus the sitting plate of 4.5 yuan is 7.5 yuan, which is a monthly interest rate of 7.5%), which is not much different from the bank's loan interest rate.</p>
<p>(3) The Amount of Legal Tender Issued: Since the currency reform, the right to issue currency in the country has been exclusively assigned to the four government banks, including the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, and the issuance reserves of each bank have also been concentrated under unified management. After this unprecedented reform, the financial foundation has become more sound, so after the outbreak of the war in the previous year, although people's hearts were extremely panicked, there were no problems in terms of currency.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, some people were mindful of the events of the European War, and they were quite concerned about inflation. However, judging from the figures in the inspection reports of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee after the war, although the total amount of issuance has been increasing, it does not seem to be an inflationary phenomenon compared with before and after the war. According to the inspection report of the committee, the total amount of issuance at the end of 1937 was 1,639,098,000 yuan, and it increased to 1,726,998,000 yuan at the end of June 1938. The rate of increase was actually not as fast as in the early days of the reform. From December 1935 to December 1936, the amount of legal tender issued increased by a total of 56.8 million yuan. From December 1936 to December 1937, it increased by a total of 37.9 million yuan. In the first half of 1938, it increased by only 87 million yuan. The committee has not formally announced the number of occurrences after June 1938, and there is currently no way to count it.</p>
<p>As for the amount of legal tender circulating in Shanghai and its speed of circulation, general observations show that there is no significant increase. On the contrary, after restricting withdrawals and deposits, a part of the currency has become locked accounts, and the stagnation of industry and commerce has greatly reduced the speed of currency circulation.</p>
<p>(4) Foreign Exchange Control and the Foreign Exchange Black Market: Before the currency reform, our country's foreign exchange rate was allowed to rise and fall naturally. After the currency reform, the purchase and sale of foreign exchange was centrally managed by the national bank, and the foreign exchange rate became stable. At the beginning of the war, domestic funds once fled. At that time, commentators believed that controlling foreign exchange was a necessary measure during wartime. However, the government authorities believed that our country's environment was special and were unwilling to deal with it rashly. Until the beginning of March of last year, the so-called "Joint Reserve Bank" was established in North China to issue inconvertible paper money in an attempt to exchange legal tender and obtain foreign exchange. In order to prevent this, the government had to announce the Foreign Exchange Application Rules on March 14 of last year, stipulating that when banks need foreign exchange for legitimate purposes after offsetting receipts and payments, they may apply to the Central Bank to purchase it. After being approved by the Central Bank, the foreign exchange will be sold at the statutory exchange rate. Applications for goods imported without legitimate purposes or unnecessarily will not be approved. In July, the government continued to stipulate the types of goods to be restricted from import, and stipulated that banks should provide the same amount of legal tender cash when applying for foreign exchange to prevent the abuse of deliberately applying for excessive amounts. At the same time, in order to increase foreign exchange funds, the foreign exchange of export trade was also centrally managed by the national bank. All foreign exchange received by merchants from the export of goods should also be sold to the national bank. From August 8 of last year, it was stipulated that the Central Bank would no longer accept applications for foreign exchange for imported goods shipped after January 1 of last year. However, imports of necessities would still be supplied in appropriate amounts, and foreign exchange control became increasingly strict.</p>
<p>Before the foreign exchange control, the Shanghai foreign exchange market price was generally based on the exchange rate announced by the Central Bank, and all foreign banks also abided by the gentleman's agreement and followed the Central Bank's quotation. After the implementation of the control, this gentleman's agreement was virtually cancelled. At the same time, general importers could not purchase the full amount of foreign exchange from the Central Bank and had to purchase it at a high price outside the Central Bank to meet their needs. In addition, people in the concessions who were good at worrying about the future purchased foreign exchange for the insurance of their personal property. Therefore, although the Central Bank still supplied the approved foreign exchange at the original exchange rate, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai was far more expensive than the statutory exchange rate.</p>
<p>The existence of the foreign exchange black market has a negative impact on Shanghai's trade and finance. The remedy depends on the cooperation of foreign banks and friendly countries. Recently, a new loan of 10 million pounds from China and the United Kingdom has been established and designated for balancing the foreign exchange of legal tender. Therefore, the international conditions for stabilizing our country's foreign exchange have been secured. In the future, we only hope that the people of the country will practice thrift, purchase fewer imported goods, and not seek private interests or speculate, so that the decline in foreign exchange will not increase. Not only can the black market gradually stabilize, but it is not difficult to achieve the fundamental goal of elimination.</p>
<p>(5) Over-the-Counter Trading of Public Bonds: The public bond market also occupies an important position in Shanghai's financial institutions. The purchase and sale of public bonds by banking and money industries is not only regarded as a reliable investment, but also can be used as a method to adjust funds. When there is a lot of floating capital, public bonds are purchased and stored, and when there is a shortage, they are sold. The market has the nature of a second-tier business reserve. In the past, there were more than 30 types of domestic public bonds. After the reorganization in 1936, they were merged into a unified public bond with an annual interest rate of 6%, which was issued in five types: A, B, C, D, and E. In order to balance the national treasury's revenue and expenditure and revive the economy, a Revival Public Bond was issued. This public bond has no transaction in the market. After this reorganization, the financial foundation became more sound, the credit of debt was transformed and stabilized, and the price gradually increased. In June 1937, the market price of each debt reached a maximum of about 89 yuan. After the outbreak of the war, the situation suddenly changed.</p>
<p>After the Lugouqiao Incident broke out in early July of the previous year, the Shanghai public bond market showed a sharp downward trend. It was common for the exchange to suspend trading several times a day. Finally, the Ministry of Finance limited the minimum price of unified public bonds to 70 yuan, and it was then calmed. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai-South China Stock Exchange suspended business, but over-the-counter transactions were still active. The daily turnover increased from 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Later, it gradually became a semi-open market. Initially, the over-the-counter market price was around 40 yuan. At the end of January of last year, in order to eliminate capital flight, the government changed the principal and interest of the unified public bond to interbank remittance funds, and the over-the-counter market price fell below 40 yuan. The lowest price in February reached a new record of 37 yuan. From March to June, the lowest price was 40 yuan and the highest was 60 yuan. By the end of July, the principal and interest of the maturing public bond were still paid in legal tender by the government, and the over-the-counter market price stabilized at around 54 or 55 yuan. At the end of September, the European situation was tense, and securities prices fell all over the world. Shanghai was not immune to this. Each debt had a rise and fall of a few cents every day. After the peace news came out, it returned to its old appearance. Afterwards, because the foreign exchange market was stable and there was no profit to be made from hedging foreign exchange, a part of the floating capital went to the public bond market. The market price of each debt rose consistently. In January of this year, the Unified Jia Public Bond created a high price of 63 yuan. However, at the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced that because our country had lost a large amount of tariff revenue and the funds paid by the government for debts guaranteed by tariffs had accumulated to a huge amount of 175 million yuan, it would no longer pay for the long-term debts before the war in the future. When the news came, the public bond market caused a huge wave, and in one day, the decline was more than 6 yuan for many. Later, the government announced that the principal and interest of the domestic debt due at the end of January would still be paid in legal tender, but the payment would be made in Chongqing. The Shanghai side could receive it from the three banks of China, China, and Communications in six installments, which would be paid off within six months. Then people's hearts were slightly settled, and the debt market recovered. Recently, a new loan from China and the United Kingdom has been established, and the market situation is more active. At present, the market price of each debt has fallen by about 30 yuan compared with the market price before the war. The market price of the National Salvation Public Bond issued after the war has always been around 36 yuan. There has been no change so far. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Summary of Famous Works</p>
<h3>American Economics Popular Today</h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>According to the London "Economist" magazine published on January 21 of this year: Recently, there are four concepts that are extremely popular in American economic thought. Moreover, their theories have a tendency to evolve into new doctrines. The following is a summary translation of their main points:</p>
<p>Purchasing Power Compensation Theory　This theory is closely related to the "excess accumulation theory," especially the tax theory of "redistributing national income by increasing tax revenue." They believe that purchasing power must exist for demand to exist; and that demand must exist to stimulate increased production. Therefore, rather than saying that "purchasing power is the result of production," "it is better to say that the possibility of production lies in the stimulating force of demand; that is, in the existence of purchasing power." They believe that the decline of the American railway industry last year was due to wage cuts. Wage cuts led to a decline in purchasing power, thereby making it difficult to restore the economy. At the same time, they also believe that raising tariffs can maintain higher wages, thereby increasing purchasing power. This theory is not only popular in the United States today, but also resonates with many thinkers in other countries, especially France. However, its prevalence is not as widespread as in the United States.</p>
<p>National Treasury Adjustment of National Economy Theory　Even if the national treasury is poor, the state can adopt methods of increasing currency or other methods that can increase national savings, thereby creating national income. Transferring national treasury funds to the people will indeed cause the national treasury to suffer a deficit, but national income (not the gross national product, but the total amount of individual income) can be expected to increase. Similarly, increasing national treasury funds has the possibility of increasing national income. If, due to adhering to the principle of balancing the national budget, national income is limited to the so-called general "normal" level, it is a great mistake from the perspective of the national economy. Due to this view, the national treasury is regarded as a "pump" for adjusting national income; and because a national treasury deficit can increase national income, it is further advocated that this "pump" must "spray water"; and it has evolved into a "credit expansion policy."</p>
<p>Shortening Working Hours to Restore Economic Prosperity Theory　Generally, based on the health of workers, it is advocated that weekly working hours should not exceed forty-eight hours. Now, for the sake of restoring economic prosperity, it is further advocated that weekly working hours be reduced to below forty-eight hours. The U.S. National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 stipulated a 40-hour work week. Although it was later abolished, in the industrial sector, many people have become accustomed to this 40-hour work system and continue to maintain it. Some even uphold it as a traditional right. Because reducing working hours can increase the employment rate of workers, that is, increase general purchasing power. Based on the purchasing power compensation theory, it can be regarded as a means of restoring prosperity.</p>
<p>Theory of Providing the Elderly, Weak, and Unemployed with a Minimum Living Allowance　The unemployed and the elderly should be recognized as having the right to enjoy a minimum living allowance; that is, they must be given purchasing power. The principle of this theory can be found in its attitude towards pensions. According to the current U.S. pension law, it is stipulated that a monthly government pension of $30 should be given. Half of it is paid by the federal government, and the other half is borne by the local government. In addition, the Social Security Act also has provisions for old-age pensions. During last year's general election, increasing the amount of old-age pensions temporarily became the center of American public opinion. And paying $200 per month may not necessarily be more than the actual income two years ago. This theory has a tendency to spread throughout the United States. It is generally believed that the pension system can increase purchasing power, thereby stimulating general consumption, and even stimulating increased production. The increased burden of national treasury payments for pensions will easily cause a deficit in the national treasury. However, this deficit is just the "spraying of water by the pump." Therefore, this theory is actually an extension of the "National Treasury Adjustment of National Economy Theory." It is also an extension of the "Purchasing Power Compensation Theory."</p>

<h3>Finance　British Pure Gold Remains Stable, No Cash Transactions Open</h3>
<p>The after-hours market for cash clamshells was quiet. Due to the weekly holiday, few members attended.

<h3>Securities　Chinese and Western Stock Markets in One Week</h3>
<p>Last week, foreign stock trading outside the General Chamber of Commerce was particularly strong, and the market remained strong. Several stocks reached their highest records in the past two years, such as Telephone (80 yuan), Electric Power Preferred Stock (132 yuan), Gonghexing (205 yuan), and Yangzi Silver Company (6.95 yuan).

<h3>Comparison of Foreign Debt in the Past Week</h3>
<p>In the past week, the announcement of the establishment of the exchange equalization fund loan of 10 million pounds from the four Chinese and British banks was welcomed by all parties, and people were excited.

<h3>Changes in Shanghai's Industry and Commerce in the Past Year (Continued from the 23rd of Last Month)</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Liquidation and Closure</p>
<p>In the past year, a total of 149 industrial and commercial firms closed down due to difficulties in maintaining operations or due to other accidents. Among them, there were 20 factories and 129 commercial firms. Among these 149 liquidations and closures, according to the classification of industry and commerce, the clothing industry ranked first with 31 firms, followed by the food and beverage industry with 27 firms, the financial industry with 22 firms, the daily necessities industry and the metal and electrical industry with 9 firms each, the cultural industry with 8 firms, the transportation industry with 7 firms, the civil engineering industry with 4 firms, the health industry, the transportation industry, and the fuel industry with 3 firms each, the travel industry with 2 firms, and the decoration industry, the pharmaceutical industry, the entertainment industry, the public utility industry, and special industries with 1 firm each.

<h3>Grain　Nearly 10,000 Bags of National Rice Arrive Again, Market Price is Clearly Stable but Secretly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of national rice, the lower reaches of the river, did not arrive. However, there were quite a few bags of rice transported by rail, nearly 10,000 bags. Since the previous rumors in the market that the price would be lowered by one yuan, the situation seemed to be falling, but this effect was inevitably self-defeating. The Rice Industry Association repeatedly stated that the price was strictly limited and should not exceed 14 yuan. Therefore, although it was a bluff, the result was ultimately difficult to violate the facts. Yesterday, the market opened and people's hearts were relaxed. Most of them returned the goods they had received the day before, and the source was also strong. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice and Duyang sharp-tip rice did not rise or fall, but in fact, they showed a clear stability but a secret weakness. The price of bianyuan rice was flat at 19.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market　Taikoo Granulated White Sugar Rises by Two Corners</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Taikoo granulated white sugar also rose because the opening price increased. B spot price: 24.6 yuan at the dock, 24.96 yuan at the west dock, CW brand 24.55 yuan, CX brand 24.42 yuan, DY brand 24.35 yuan, HX brand 24.15 yuan, H brand raw red sugar still 16.6 yuan, and the near-term price of 24 Dutch coarse white sugar was once 5.17 yuan. Yesterday's call plate increased slightly, but there were no transactions. The association's plate was flat at 24.7 yuan outside the dock and 24.85 yuan at this dock. The price of the Da Jinqian brand was 25.15 yuan, the price of Taikoo XA brand was 24.7 yuan, the spot price of Dutch red sugar was 16.6 yuan, and the price of transit goods was 11 yuan. As the price of coarse white sugar rose, the price of the local factory's cotton white sugar also followed closely. The price of Zhenji No. 1 was 24.8 yuan, the prices of No. 2, 3, and 4 remained unchanged, and the price of No. 1 ice sugar was 33.3 yuan. There were sporadic transactions of domestic sugar, with only a few dozen bags of Qi white sugar opened, priced at 19 yuan. Xinghua white sugar was called at 23.5 yuan, and Hainan red sugar still held the original price. It was found that the goods previously opened at 13.9 yuan were still in the hands of the firm, so although the source was scarce, the receivers were extremely rare.</p>
<h3>Hardware　High Costs (Continued)　Sales Plates for Various Goods are All Increased, but Customer Sales are Reduced</h3>
<p>Local Nails　Since the factory increased the price, the association's negotiated price also increased accordingly. Therefore, the market price for each barrel of Bessemer steel nails is 17 yuan, but there are still many secret transactions at a price of 16.89 yuan. Recently, transactions have been smoother with Sichuan and Fujian merchants, while other merchants only have sporadic transactions.</p>
<p>Purple Copper Ingots　Transactions with local customers are all quiet. However, the Ordnance Factory and Copper Bureau still have purchases, so the market situation is still good. The market price is affected by the sharp increase in the fixed price and the increase in the association's red plate, so the opening price is always around 90 yuan and 92 yuan.</p>
<p>Tinplate　Sales are the widest with Shaoxing merchants, because the tin foil produced there is sold throughout the country. Currently, affected by the war, transportation is blocked, and the market for tin foil is sluggish, so sales have stagnated. However, the market price in Shanghai is very strong as decided by the red plate, with an opening price of 370 yuan per dan, but there are few real transactions and a lack of large quantities, so the market atmosphere is quiet.</p>
<p>Lead　Since overseas fixed prices have skyrocketed and the local port's shilling exchange rate has increased, the market price has suddenly risen to 37 yuan. However, real transactions are only sporadic, so the market is very quiet. It is heard that mixed lead firms are only selling for about 26 yuan, but real sales are still sluggish, making it even more difficult to develop transactions in foreign lead (i.e., imported goods).</p>
<p>Pure Antimony　Due to the impact of the war and the active expansion of armaments by various countries, the pure antimony produced in Hunan, China, is being absorbed as much as possible, so the transactions are quite large. The opening price of spot goods is also very considerable, with the highest market price opening at 1,400 yuan, and the market atmosphere is unusually stable. (End)</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Concentrated in Northern Jiangsu Awaiting Orders　To Form an Arc-Shaped Encirclement of Japanese Troops　Residents Along the Ports Flee to the Interior One After Another Japanese Attempts to Block Various Ports Cannot be Realized</h3>
<p>The Chinese troops in the five counties of Tongzhou, Rugao, Chongming, Haimen and Qidong in northern Jiangsu have been ordered to station themselves at the various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, forming an arc-shaped encirclement of the Japanese troops at places such as Tiensheng Harbor and Qinglong Harbor, awaiting an opportunity to counterattack. Residents along the river are evacuating to the interior. The Japanese side's original plan to blockade the ports from March 10 will be difficult to realize. The following is a report from the modern press reporter:</p>
<p>Troops from All Sides Stationed Along the Ports　The Chinese troops originally stationed in the five counties of Nantong, Rugao, Chongming, Haimen, and Qidong in northern Jiangsu have been ordered by the General Headquarters of the 24th Army Group of the Third War Zone to advance from the interior to the ports for defense starting on the evening of March 9. Currently, about 70,000 to 90,000 Chinese troops are densely deployed within a distance of approximately 150 nautical miles from Songji Harbor in Haimen to Xinsheng Harbor in Rugao, and have established contact, forming an arc-shaped encirclement of the Japanese military bases along the coast, such as Qinglong Harbor in Haimen, Tiensheng Harbor in Nantong, and Xinsheng Harbor in Rugao. Strong defensive fortifications and trenches for attacking the Japanese troops have been built.</p>
<p>Port Residents Evacuate to the Interior　The military authorities, considering that the general counteroffensive is about to begin, and in view of the past brutal acts of the Japanese army, indiscriminately bombing with planes and artillery, harming the lives and property of innocent civilians, have ordered the residents of all ports along the river to evacuate to the interior as soon as possible in order to reduce or avoid such tragic events. Therefore, in recent days, the situation of congestion everywhere due to the migration of various ports has entered a state of war. Various businesses are also winding down in order to evacuate when necessary. Although the ships are still sailing as usual, the cargo volume has decreased sharply.</p>
<p>Japanese Blockade of Ports Difficult to Realize　The Japanese side originally planned to implement a blockade of all ports on the North Jiangsu line that are not stationed by Japanese troops starting on March 10, cutting off the transportation and communication of the Chinese troops. Unexpectedly, this plan was foreseen by the Chinese troops, who moved their troops to the ports before the Japanese blockade. If the Japanese side takes any action, they will be severely attacked. According to the authorities, although the Japanese army has the superior position of naval bombardment along the coast, the Chinese troops have strong deployments and troop deployments on land. In fact, it may not be possible to recover all the lost territory, but at least it can consume a large amount of Japanese ammunition.</p>
<h3>Zhuanqiao Tense Situation Japanese Casualties Quite Heavy Villagers Flock to Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the Chinese army moved west, Shanghai County became a guerrilla area. Zhuanqiao, Beiqiao, Maqiao, Tangwan and other places are controlled by the Chinese guerrillas. Yesterday, according to a Zhuanqiao villager who came to Shanghai, recently, a small puppet of the Zhuanqiao puppet organization, Yao, used to be an employee of Toyota Spinning Factory. Recently, in order to please his "master," he went to various villages and towns to widely collect cotton, arbitrarily lowering the price of cotton and exploiting the good people. Therefore, the general farmers all hate him. Yesterday, he was attacked by the 47th Tourist Detachment of Baima Mountain. Yao reported to the Japanese side for revenge and surrounded him. However, the guerrillas were prepared. On that day, the fierce battle lasted for a day and a night. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and the guerrillas suffered slight casualties. Therefore, in recent days, the situation in Zhuanqiao, Beiqiao and other places has been very tense, and the villagers have been leaving their homes to avoid Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Various Circles Commemorated the Passing of the Premier; Today is Industry Propaganda Day; Various Trade Unions Issue Letters to Fellow Workers; The Industrial Sector Voluntarily Formulates Endeavor Guidelines</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the 14th anniversary of the passing of the Premier. Various circles in the city flew flags at half-mast for the entire day. Various organizations held commemorative meetings and observed a moment of silence at noon to express their condolences. Entertainment venues also voluntarily closed to express their sorrow. Yesterday was the commercial sector propaganda day for the first publicity week of the second phase of the war of resistance in the city. Various commercial organizations issued letters to fellow members of the business community, encouraging them to strive to promote domestic goods and to vigorously develop the rich resources of the southwest and northwest. Today is industry propaganda day. The following is a record of the letters from various trade unions to all workers in the city and the industry's endeavor guidelines:</p>
<p>Fellow workers of the city, today, as the war of resistance has surpassed twenty months, we see the bravery and sacrifice of the soldiers at the front, the increasing depletion of the enemy's strength, and the approaching of final victory. At this juncture, we need to intensify our efforts and strive to overcome all kinds of difficulties and complete the great task of resistance and nation-building. In the past, the efforts of all Shanghai workers in resisting the enemy and saving the nation have had great manifestations. Now, the second phase of the war of resistance has already begun, and we should continue the spirit of the past, and more widely and deeply intensify our efforts. First, since Shanghai fell, most of our country's factories have been destroyed by the enemy, while the enemy's factories are trying to recover, attempting to use the low wages of our workers to dominate the markets of the Far East. Our patriotic workers who understand the righteousness of the matter should voluntarily not work in the enemy's factories. Workers who are already working in the enemy's factories should immediately and voluntarily withdraw. At the same time, we hope that the workers working in our country's factories can embrace the spirit of national supremacy, ethnic supremacy, and self-sacrifice, and voluntarily increase working hours to promote the production business, or voluntarily reduce wages, shorten hours, and other methods, to accommodate workers who withdraw from the enemy's factories, as well as the general unemployed workers. Second, most of our country's factories have moved to the interior, so there is an urgent need for skilled and technical workers in the rear. Among the unemployed workers in Shanghai, there are many skilled and technical workers. If they stay in Shanghai and suffer the pain of unemployment, it is better to summon up the courage to find work in the rear. On the one hand, the country's needs and supplies can be coordinated, and on the other hand, production can be strengthened, national strength can be enhanced, and at the same time, personal life can be solved, so that human resources will not be wasted. Third, the workers of Shanghai have always been rich in the spirit of loving the country and loving the nation. Especially in this great era of national resistance, we should embrace the meaning of "everyone is responsible" to participate in this sacred war. Therefore, we warmly hope that the workers of the city will actively rise up and go to the interior to serve in the military as much as possible. Looking at the past wars in European countries, overseas Chinese living abroad have all automatically returned to their countries to participate in the military. Could it be that our compatriots living in the country cannot go to the interior to serve in the military? We must know that being idle in this isolated island of Shanghai is the most cowardly and shameful thing. Fourth, the workers of Shanghai have always been organized, and their strength and greatness have a glorious history in the Chinese revolutionary movement. At this critical moment of life and death for the country and the nation, this organizational force should do its utmost for the country and the nation. Our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, has repeatedly instructed us, "Before the country and the nation, we should sacrifice all private opinions, selfishness, private interests, private gains, and even sacrifice personal freedom and life." Therefore, at this juncture, all labor-capital disputes should no longer occur. Labor and capital should work together in the spirit of sharing the same boat and being like hands and feet, and make the best efforts for the country. The above four points are deeply hoped that the workers of the city will be of one mind and one heart to promote their realization. Shanghai Municipal Trade Unions</p>
<p>Attached: Industry Publicity Day Endeavor Guidelines (1) Do not work in the factories of the enemy and traitors (2) Do not be obedient people (3) Do not buy the enemy's goods (4) Do not spy for the enemy and traitors (5) Go to the interior to serve in the military (6) Go to work in the rear (7) Help unemployed workers find legitimate work (8) Labor and capital cooperate closely (9) Improve trade union organizations (10) Do not participate in traitor trade unions or pseudo-organizations</p>
<h3>Saving Two Dollars a Month Can Save a Life; The Variety Show Broadcasting Committee Issues a Letter to All Circles</h3>
<p>The Variety Show Broadcasting Committee of the Citizen Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to appeal to all circles to participate in the refugee adoption movement, specially issued a letter to all circles, saying that people in the city, when going out to play, eat, dance, watch a movie, or play a small game of mahjong, spend two dollars, which is not considered a big deal, but from the perspective of the poor refugees, these two dollars are enough for them to maintain a month of life. Therefore, the committee has the slogan "Saving two dollars a month can save a refugee's life," appealing to all circles to participate in the refugee adoption movement. At present, there are still many refugees in the city, and they are still increasing. At the same time, the date of maintaining their lives is much longer than the dates of relief after previous natural disasters. Therefore, a large amount of funds is very likely to be used up in a very short period. As for improving their lives, there is no need to talk about it, but our purpose is not only to maintain their lives, but also to use their spare labor so that they can also use their own labor to supply their own daily needs within the possible range, so that the burden on our citizens in the future can be reduced. The group has a broadcasting fundraising committee to handle broadcasting publicity matters. Now, with the enthusiastic support and participation of the leaders of the variety show industry, the owners of various radio stations, and charitable people from all walks of life who care about the future of society, the scope of the committee has been expanded and the Variety Show Broadcasting Committee has been established. In the future, the variety show broadcasting method will be used to promote to all circles, please pay more attention to the future of the refugees, and have more pity for the suffering of the refugees. Therefore, take out more money to help them, and strive to raise more funds in the shortest period, in addition to prolonging their lives, but also to purchase some production tools to gradually put them on the road to self-sufficiency. Shanghai opera also sings, "The poor are not poor forever, and the rich are not rich forever." Especially in this painful period, all unpredictable environments can make great changes in life. Therefore, relieving refugees can also be said to be for one's own future. It is hoped that all circles will work hard to cooperate with the committee in the future to benefit the refugees and create safety for all our citizens.</p>
<h3>A Batch of Pseudo-"Troops" Stationed in Western Shanghai; Guerrilla Forces Will Painfully Suppress Them; Pseudo-"Troops" Equipped With Inferior Weapons and No Ammunition; Western Shanghai Farmers Fearing Harassment Retreat Together</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin newspaper reported that yesterday (the 11th), it was learned that the pseudo-troops of the "Reformed Government" had been transferred to the area outside the concession defense zone in western Shanghai, and together with the Japanese army, they were sentries at railway intersections and important bridges and intersections in the Hongqiao Road and Robogen Road areas. Last night, according to Chinese sources, the guerrilla forces, which have been active in these areas in recent months, vowed to wipe out these pseudo-troops. The villagers in a certain place near Hongqiao Road and the golf course all retreated last night. Residents in the Hongqiao area have seen pseudo-troops and Japanese sentries appear at railway intersections. These people seem to be inferior soldiers, and their equipment is inferior. Although they carry rifles, they have no ammunition. West of the railway intersection, a part of the pseudo-troops has replaced the Japanese sentries. A certain bridge, which is often stationed by two Japanese soldiers, was seen yesterday with two Japanese soldiers and pseudo-troops stationed there, and only one Japanese soldier. Even the pseudo-police station is defended by pseudo-troops. According to observers, a certain town next to Hongqiao Road seems to have established the headquarters of the pseudo-troops. Pseudo-troops can be seen throughout the town, but it is impossible to guess how many there are. Yesterday afternoon, several gunshots suddenly rang out, causing rumors that the guerrilla forces attacked the pseudo-troops in the vicinity, but it could not be confirmed. According to inquiries from the villagers, the guerrilla forces have declared that they will eliminate the pseudo-troops, so the farmers in the area have retreated together. However, until late last night, no gunshots were heard nearby, nor did any events that could prove the rumors occur. It is still recalled that several weeks ago, it was rumored that the pseudo-"Reformed Government" decided to send pseudo-troops to Shanghai to assist in the so-called "silent war" in the concession, which has been proven to be bluffing. It is said that only thirty or forty newly trained pseudo-police officers in Nanjing came to Shanghai. These people caused speculation from the outside world yesterday when they arrived in Shanghai. According to the mainland newspaper, the Japanese mainland newspaper in the city revealed yesterday (the 11th) that the Japanese side intends to establish 3 million pseudo-troops, with a cost of five jiao per person. The "army" will be composed of young people, and the movement will be started by the pseudo-"Reformed Government" in Nanjing. The cost of this plan is 1.5 million yuan. The "army" will be dedicated to "establishing peace and order in the three provinces and developing a new China."</p>
<p>Its urgent purpose is to contain the "threat of the Reds." However, according to Chinese sources, the Japanese military authorities are attempting to use their "supplementary soldiers" to deal with the increasingly active guerrilla forces that have caused serious concern to the Japanese army. According to the translation of the mainland military newspaper, the "graduates of the Reformed Academy" in Japan will form the core of the "army." After special guidance, these young people will return to various places in the occupied areas to compile the proposed "army."</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Reporter Observes the Future of the War; Japan Cannot Launch a Major Offensive in the Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Areas This Year; Chinese Military Strength is Strengthened; Garrison in the Taihu Lake Area is Important</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland News, American newspaper reporter Belden, who traveled through Central and South China, has just returned to Shanghai. It is said that the general view of Chinese army officers is that the Japanese army will not launch a major offensive until next year. Although they have not been able to determine Japan's future actions, they believe that what Tokyo is mainly concerned about today is to exert pressure on Britain and France to force China to end the war of resistance. If this move fails, the Japanese army may begin to invade Guangxi in order to cut off China's communication with the outside world. Now, one hundred divisions of the Chinese regular army and guerrilla forces, totaling one million people, are waiting in battle in the third, fourth, and ninth war zones on the south bank of the Yangtze River. However, although a large army is stationed in these areas, there has been no major military action on the south bank of the Yangtze River for many months. If the Japanese army invades Guangxi, the province may become the "second Shanxi." In addition to the difficult terrain of Guangxi, the Japanese army will also encounter the resolute resistance of the people. The people of Guangxi are now preparing to deal with any eventuality. For the sake of precaution, most of the important highways in the province have been damaged, and the highways have been flooded with water where possible. This move may not be able to stop the Japanese army, but it can slow down their invasion. Another method taken by the province is to relocate the people within five miles of the highway to other places and fully prepare for a second relocation when notified. Mr. Bell became slightly ill in Shaoguan, Guangdong, and had to stay in a British hospital. It is said that the hospital is busy treating refugees and poor civilians. The guerrilla forces and regular troops in southern Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces have been reorganized, and it is estimated that the number has reached 150,000. It may soon be seen that they are becoming more active, especially around the Taihu Lake area. The area is under the command of General Gu Zhutong. When the Chinese army withdrew in the winter of 1937, Gu unified his army. Although the area under Gu's command is currently not strategically important, the area may be of greater importance as the war progresses. During the Taiping Rebellion, Zeng Guofan also retreated into the area to reorganize his army. Ten years later, he led his troops again and dealt a fatal blow to the rebel army. In view of the fact that the Japanese army's economic and military base and the location of the puppet regime, Nanjing, are not far from the area, the area is even more important.</p>
<p>Mr. Bell believes that Gu Zhutong is one of the most capable and loyal subordinates of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The famous 87th Division, 88th Division, and the later 36th Division were formed by Gu's old troops and are one of the most elite units of the Central Army. After Gu and his troops retreated to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, many officers were sent to the interior for special training. During this period, they participated in combat exercises, received strategic training, and used the training ground as a battlefield laboratory.</p>
<p>Some of Gu's troops have entered the guerrilla area. There are currently about 150,000 guerrilla forces stationed on the south bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, and new troops are joining and gradually strengthening. The commander of all the guerrilla forces in Jiangsu Province is Leng Xin, a graduate of Huangpu, who soon served as a division commander of the Central Army. He is now also the civil administrator of the area managed by his army. Leng told Mr. Bell that the reorganization of the guerrilla forces has been completed, and a significant increase in mobile warfare in the area can be expected. He also invited Mr. Bell to inspect the area under his administration. Mr. Bell declined because he had other appointments. Mr. Bell criticized the situation of the guerrilla forces, saying that it is a mistake to assume that all Chinese troops are now fighting guerrilla warfare, and it is not in line with the facts. According to his estimation, no more than 150,000 of the 1 million soldiers in the third war zone he passed through have been reorganized into guerrilla forces. Most of the guerrilla forces are led by officers who have received special training for half a year in the rear. The reorganization of all the guerrilla forces is also carried out by these officers. Therefore, Mr. Bell believes that the activities of the guerrilla forces in the guerrilla area will be increased.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Police Intrusion into US Military Defense Zone; Surrounded in Front of Shao Shijun's Residence; Retreat After Explanation by US Military Officer; Evidence of Intensifying Infighting Among Pseudo-Officials</h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin newspaper, just after 10:30 yesterday morning, a truck of armed soldiers from the Fourth Marine Corps of the United States stationed in Shanghai, led by two officers, drove to No. 39 Nanyang Road, the residence of Shao Shijun, the "Director of the Unified Tax Bureau," and stopped. Several detectives from the police station and four plainclothes personnel from the Japanese military police department were surrounded. Then, two US military officers were seen approaching the Japanese. It was heard that they explained that the Japanese were not allowed to take independent action in the US military defense zone. According to witnesses, the Japanese left after hearing this. Inquiries were made with the headquarters of the US Marine Corps last night, but nothing was revealed. When asked by one of the personnel, it was said that he had nothing to tell. No information about this matter was obtained from the General Patrol Room and the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room. The nature of this matter cannot be determined at present. Judging from the phenomenon, the police station and the Japanese military police department are currently investigating separately, but the presence of Japanese military officers seems to indicate that this matter must be of a political nature or a semi-political nature. It has not been heard that the Japanese military police department has investigated criminal cases in the Public Concession before. This statement seems to be able to prove the rumors that have been circulating for several weeks that the infighting among the Chinese pseudo-officials of the "Reformed Government" is quite fierce, and they have even accused each other. If yesterday's events were also in this category, it seems that someone accused Shao Shijun, and the Japanese and police station personnel investigated at the same time. Roughly, the two sides met by chance in front of his residence. According to witnesses, there was no break-up situation after the US soldiers arrived. At that time, the officers of the US Marine Corps and the Japanese military police did not hear any threatening tone in their conversation. According to the usual practice, if the Japanese police personnel want to investigate cases in the Public Concession, they should ask the police station for assistance, and then allocate some detectives as usual and go with the Japanese. But judging from yesterday's events, the Japanese did not seem to follow the previous practice. The "Unified Tax Bureau" is one of the most important parts of the "Reformed Government," and Shao Shijun is the "Director" of the bureau.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Reconsiders British Election</h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin newspaper, the British in Shanghai have arranged to pre-select five British people as candidates for the Municipal Council election according to the procedures of last year. The British Chamber of Commerce, the China Association (Shanghai Branch), and the Overseas British Association have all issued ballots, listing the names of ten tax-paying British people who are willing to serve as candidates for the council. The tax-paying British people will cross out the names of five people who they do not wish to recommend, and send the ballots to the voting inspector, Wilkinson, before March 16. Then, five of them will be selected as candidates for the council. The Municipal Council election is scheduled to be held on April 12 and 13.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Mourn Zhang Tuaian; The Ceremony Was Grand and Extremely Sad</h3>
<p>The late Nantong industrialist Zhang Tuaian passed away in Shanghai last year. More than 20 organizations, including the textile, salt reclamation, education, and charity undertakings operated by Mr. Zhang during his lifetime, held a memorial service and public memorial at the Jade Buddha Temple on Binlang Road yesterday in memory of Mr. Zhang's legacy. The ceremony was grand. The weather was sunny and beautiful on this day, and there were many guests. The organizations that attended included Nantong Dasheng Textile Company, Dada Shipping Company, Kenmu, Dafeng, Dayoujin, Dayu, Huacheng, more than 20 salt reclamation companies, Nantong College, Nantong Women's Normal School, Nantong Middle School, Textile Alumni Association, Nantong charitable organizations, Tongruchonghaiqi Five County Fellow Association, etc. Celebrities included Chen Taoyi, Shen Xinqing, Li Bako, Wu Yunzhai, Li Qiqing, Xu Jingren, Wang Dankui, etc. There were more than a thousand guests in total. The scene was unprecedentedly grand. For a time, on Binlang Road, plain cars and white horses were connected endlessly. In particular, the elegiac couplets and poems sent by various celebrities were dazzling and extremely sad. From 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m., leaders of various organizations held public memorials in order. In terms of arrangement, a plaque with the words "Memorial Service for Mr. Zhang Tuaian of Nantong" was hung high at the entrance. Mr. Zhang's portrait was hung in the central hall. From the main hall to the corridor of the temple gate, more than a thousand elegiac banners and couplets from various celebrities were hung everywhere. For example, Mr. Zhu Qinglan's couplet said, "Counting the great industrialists, Hu Lian's virtuous name is passed down to Wei Ci, mourning the lifelong best friend, Jiang Huai's noble character admires the fields." Mr. Han Guojun's couplet said, "Opening a new era for the industrial world, being full of worries until the highest years, getting great relief in times of great chaos, fortunately seeing the latecomers rising." The sons and daughters paid their respects, and dozens of condolences from various dignitaries such as Dean Kong and Minister Zhang from Chongqing were received one after another, which shows that Mr. Zhang's engagement in industry during his lifetime was deeply admired by the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>US Naval Authorities Protest to the Municipal Council Regarding the Permission Given to the Japanese to Inspect Terrorists in the Concession</h3>
<p>This newspaper's special report, the US naval authorities to the Municipal Council to establish an agreement with the Japanese side, allowing the Japanese army to inspect "terrorist" suspects in the Public Concession when the patrol room is on the ground, affecting the US military defense area jurisdiction, especially the previous day to the Municipal Council to protest.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Stabilizes Market Price; Establishes Evaluation Committee; Market Management Methods Seem to Lack Thoroughness; Rice and Grain Have Not Yet Reached a Serious Period; It is Necessary to Ban Speculation, Manipulation, and Hoarding</h3>
<p>The Shanghai rice market is affected by direct purchases from the production area by the Japanese puppets, resulting in soaring prices. Since the association stipulated a price limit, the underground market has exceeded the price limit. The bean and rice, rice shop, rice milling, sales, and other rice industry associations, as well as the South Gang Guild Hall, Changshu Guild Hall, etc., are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss and stabilize the market price. It is decided to organize an evaluation committee to ban hoarding, speculation, and manipulation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Industry Sends Representatives to Explain Everything; In addition to sending letters to the Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession Public Board of Directors, asking them to take precautions and quickly prepare good policies, the Bean Rice Industry Association also sent members Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and Fu Qiangeng to the two concession authorities to explain everything together with Zhang Nianxuan, chairman of the Rice Shop Industry Association. He De Kui and others received them and exchanged opinions on stabilizing rice prices. It is heard that the concession authorities believe that it is not yet time to order foreign rice and should first find ways to dredge the sources, so as to prevent the panic of lack of food for Shanghai citizens.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting to Stabilize Rice Prices; In addition to advising merchants from various places to resume transportation, the Market Management Committee also invited various firms to maintain the price limit. Now, because the prices of various rice in the market have risen to the price limit, and the general hoarders are unwilling to sell at the price limit, merchants dare not transport in large quantities due to cost reasons, resulting in underground transactions. The Bean Rice Industry Association believes that the price of rice in the underground market exceeds the price limit, which is a matter of great importance to the food of Shanghai citizens, so it has been decided to convene the Rice Shop, Rice Milling, and Business Associations, as well as the South Gang Changshu Guild Hall, at 2:00 p.m. today to discuss stabilization methods.</p>
<p>Decision to Organize Evaluation Committee; According to news from rice industry organizations, in accordance with the regulations on food adjustment during the extraordinary period promulgated by the government, "If the local food prices fluctuate abnormally due to speculation and manipulation by unscrupulous people, the local government or food adjustment agencies should take appropriate measures to stop them, and they may carefully stipulate the highest or lowest prices of food in important food markets, taking into account the actual situation, to prevent manipulation. Therefore, it is decided to organize an evaluation committee to assess rice prices. The candidates for the committee will be nominated at today's joint meeting. In the future, the rice price will be assessed weekly or daily first, and then the market will announce the market transaction, and it is planned that the market customers must use transaction orders before the transaction to avoid hoarders or empty-headed brokers from spreading rumors and affecting the market."</p>
<p>Municipal Council Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss; In view of the soaring rice prices in Shanghai in recent days, which is related to the livelihood of the common people, in addition to supervising rice industry organizations to properly stabilize the market price and monitor the situation in the trading market and find ways to stop it, in order to regulate the food of Shanghai citizens in the future, the Municipal Council will hold a board meeting this week, and then submit it to the Food Joint Management Committee to be responsible for planning everything.</p>
<p>Banning Speculation, Manipulation, and Hoarding; The underground market price of rice in the Shanghai Bean Rice Market has exceeded the price limit of 14 yuan per stone. The main reason is that the direct purchases from the production area by the Japanese puppets have raised the price of rice in the interior, and merchants dare not transport in large quantities due to cost reasons, but it is inevitable that there will be hoarding and speculation. It is now decided to send members to thoroughly investigate whether there are unscrupulous merchants monopolizing and manipulating, and deal with it in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, Paragraph 2 of the Wartime Agricultural, Mining, and Industrial and Commercial Management Regulations promulgated by the government, and ask the two concession authorities to provide full assistance.</p>
<p>Proposing to Order to Prevent Lack; The government stipulates that if there is a lack of food and it is considered necessary to transport foreign rice with tax exemption or tax reduction to adjust it, it should be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and Economics and then to the Executive Yuan for approval before purchasing and transporting it. Now, the rice industry organizations, in view of the fact that there is sufficient reserve in Shanghai at present, there will be no panic of lack for the time being, but there will inevitably be a lack in the future when the old and new crops are not connected. Therefore, it is hoped that the two concession authorities will follow the methods of the winter of 1937 and order foreign rice, transport it to Shanghai in batches, and hand it over to the rice industry organizations for equal distribution, and ask the government to specially approve tax-free imports and provide foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Food Has Not Reached a Serious Period; According to Zhang Nianxuan, a rice industry tycoon, told the Modern News reporter yesterday, the soaring rice prices in Shanghai in recent days have caused a lot of complaints from all parties. Tracing the reasons, it is not the source of rice in the interior and the amount of storage in Shanghai, but it is due to the market operation and management methods, which seem to lack thoroughness. According to the current amount of storage in Shanghai, it is enough for three or four months of food for the people, and there is no serious period at all. Even in the future, there is no worry of lack and panic. According to personal opinion, (1) dredge the source, (2) assess the market price, (3) the benefits that the industry should get, proceed according to these three principles, then the hoarders will have no way to use their skills, and the rice price can also tend to be stable.</p>
<h3>Public Benefit Fees for Shanghai-Ningbo Ships to be Paid According to Net Cargo Tonnage; Coal Bunkers and Water Tanks Not Included in Calculation</h3>
<p>The shipping lines operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, including the "De Ping," "Mou Fu," "Tang Sai," "Shan Tai," and "Xin Beijing," sent a letter yesterday to the Shipping Association, which was then telegraphed to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Department of Finance. The letter stated that the public benefit fees for imported goods paid by the ships should be calculated according to the net cargo tonnage, as per regulations. However, the "De Ping" and other ships had mistakenly included the tonnage occupied by coal bunkers and water tanks in their reported tonnage. The letter included a detailed table of the tonnage occupied by each part of the ship and requested permission to correct the error and pay public benefit fees based on the net cargo tonnage of the ships, to alleviate the burden.</p>
<h3>Catholic Action Society Held Prayers Yesterday for Pope Pius XII; Mass Attended by Many Catholics</h3>
<p>After the death of Pope Pius XI, the College of Cardinals elected Secretary of State Cardinal Pacelli as Pope Pius XII. The Catholic Action Society, the sole Catholic organization in this city, led by Lu Yin Geng and Zhu Ziyao, sent a telegram to Rome congratulating the new Pope. To express their congratulations, they held a Mass at 7:30 AM yesterday at the Sacred Heart Church on Avenue Joffre, praying for the health and well-being of the new Pope. Father Xu Zongduo presided over the Mass, and many members of the society attended, making the occasion very lively.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an Makes Demands to the Shanghai Municipal Council, Uttering Delusional Requests</h3>
<p>According to the *North China Daily News*, the Japanese-backed "Mayor" of Shanghai, Fu Xiao'an, lodged a protest yesterday (the 11th) with the Shanghai Municipal Council (Chairman Fessenden and Secretary General Feester) and the consular body. He demanded improvements in policing methods to curb terrorism and communist crimes in the International and French Concessions, and the return of the "Avenue Road" police station in the western district, which had recently been closed by the British military authorities. In addition, he demanded house-to-house searches for terrorists and communists in the International Settlement, the immediate handover of the Special Court to the new municipal government, the surrender of all official documents and archives of the former Land Office, and the prohibition of the Kuomintang flag in the International Settlement. He warned that if the Council refused to accept his protest and fulfill his demands, it would be responsible for any losses and consequences that might arise.</p>
<h3>Japanese Boat Carrying Munitions Intercepted in Zhagang; Over Forty Japanese Soldiers Annihilated in Tangwan; Martial Law Imposed and Electric Fences Installed in Coastal Areas</h3>
<p>On the 10th, four Japanese gasoline boats loaded with munitions were sailing near Zhagang when they were spotted by Ding Xishan's guerrilla forces. The guerrillas fired shots to stop them, and the Japanese soldiers on board returned fire, attempting to provide cover for the boats' advance. The guerrillas bravely charged forward, surrounding the boats and detaining them. They seized over thirty boxes of bullets and twelve boxes of hand grenades, and captured eight Japanese military police hiding in the cabins, who were taken to headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle in Tangwan. In Tangwan Town, Shanghai County, traitors Wang Fugen and Gu A'bao forcibly abducted women on the evening of the 5th. Guerrilla forces killed Wang Fugen, but Gu A'bao escaped. The next day, Gu led a Japanese company of about forty soldiers from the direction of Beiqiao, surrounding the town and setting it on fire. Qian Bin, the leader of the guerrilla forces, upon hearing the news, led his troops to attack. A fierce battle ensued for over three hours, resulting in the annihilation of all the Japanese soldiers and the capture of thirteen alive. Over thirty civilian houses in the town were burned down.</p>
<p>Martial Law in Coastal Areas. The atmosphere in Pudong has been extremely tense recently. Yesterday (the 11th), the Japanese military imposed martial law. Electric fences have been installed and sandbags piled up along the Huangpu River to the Fanli area. The coastal area is guarded by the Japanese Marine Corps, while the urban area is controlled by Japanese military police. Several streets have been blockaded, and there are very few pedestrians on the streets.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Refund Procedures</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance announced that the process of refunding income tax in provinces and counties, which originally required submitting requests level by level, was time-consuming due to the back-and-forth of documents. To expedite the process and provide convenience to taxpayers, the Income Tax Administration has revised the "Provisional Measures for Tax Refunds," consisting of fifteen articles, which have been approved by the Ministry and are now being implemented. According to the new regulations, tax refunds of less than 100 yuan can be approved by the provincial administration, while refunds of 100 yuan or more must still be submitted to the Ministry and the Administration for approval. These measures will be effective from July 1st of this year, which is the beginning of the 28th year of the Republic (1939).</p>

<p>Japanese and Puppet Regime Attempt to Seize Southeastern Electricity and Water Utilities</p>
<p>All Companies Under the Control of Central China Water and Electricity Company Firmly Refuse Cooperation</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army withdrew from Shanghai, the Japanese have established the so-called "Central China Water and Electricity Company," with the intention of seizing all water and electricity utilities in the Southeast. The Japanese government directed the "Central China Government" in Nanjing to formulate regulations entrusting the "Central China Water and Electricity Company" with the management of various water and electricity plants in the Southeast. The Japanese had already seized the assets of plants in Shanghai and the surrounding area, treating them as their own. However, most water and electricity companies in other regions were still staffed by employees, making it difficult to seize them without a pretext. Although the Japanese had repeatedly requested cooperation from these companies, they had been firmly refused. Last month, the puppet "Ministry of Industry" in Nanjing suddenly published an announcement inviting representatives from major power plants and water companies along the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou lines to attend a meeting to discuss the so-called cooperation. The announcement stated that if they failed to attend, the "reorganization measures" stipulated by the Ministry would be implemented. Major power plants in Nanjing, Wuxi, and Hangzhou ignored the announcement and refused to attend, causing the meeting to fail. Seeing that their attempts to acquire the utilities through trickery had failed, the Japanese have decided to disregard everything and order the puppet authorities to directly assign the water and electricity plants to the "Central China Water and Electricity Company."</p>

<h3>True Love After Marriage Must be Forged Through Health</h3>
<p>— By Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>Although many people reach the goal of marriage, it is not easy to maintain love after marriage forever. The union of two sexes is by no means a small matter, but the supremely important event of life. If one can only take care of the wedding ceremony and cannot give play to the spirit of cooperation in married life, it will ultimately create a great tragedy.</p>
<p>There are often many tragedies of divorce played out in society. Although there are many reasons for these tragedies, the main point is mostly due to the failure of love to merge. Because the love between men and women must be forged from health. If you lose this healthy body and soul, then no matter how superior the living environment you have, it is in vain!</p>
<p>To keep our health from being lost due to married life, the first question depends on cherishing virginity before marriage and avoiding self-abuse. After marriage, it is especially important to restrain sexual desire, so that the love between both sexes will not be abandoned due to a temporary lack of reproductive power. However, if there is a true abnormality in reproductive power, you must not avoid medical treatment. In addition to paying extra attention to reproductive hygiene, you should also use the most effective German youth glandular preparations for men, "Bokang", so that reproductive power will be rejuvenated and love will be as new as ever.</p>
<p>Although reproduction is a natural human instinct, there is no guarantee that the enjoyment of marital pleasure will not be lost due to pathological symptoms of sexual sensitivity. In medicine, this is called sexual dysfunction, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and female frigidity. Those who suffer from this are indeed a symptom of their own physical weakness. People over forty years of age have a decline in reproductive energy due to physiological factors. This is because the youth gland that governs sexual power changes from strong to weak. This is because a person's libido gradually disappears with age. This is not only true for libido, but also for the spirit, skin, and other parts of the body. Now that we understand that the health of sexual power lies in the prosperity of the youth gland, "Bokang", the male and robust animal youth glandular endocrine preparation invented by German venereal disease expert Dr. Meulen, is indeed a great invention of 24th-century medical crystallization. After taking it, the mind is clear, the spirit is uplifted, the complexion is ruddy, the appetite is increased, and the sexual function is very healthy. There are absolutely no symptoms of premature ejaculation or impotence, and it can promote reproductive function and help the sexual organs develop. It can restore the sexual power of middle-aged people, nourish the brain, kidney, and blood, all of which are its outstanding effects. It is a sacred tonic product for the old and young. The female "Bokang" is a good medicine for regulating menstruation and promoting pregnancy, treating anemia and breast atrophy, especially for frigidity that occurs after marriage. One dose of this medicine will immediately turn you into an affectionate person.</p>

<h3>New Treatment for Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— By Huang Zhongchang, MD, USA</p>
<p>The difficulty of treating gonorrhea and the lack of effective and rapid cures have long been known to patients with chronic gonorrhea. They have suffered from gonorrhea for three to five years and taken many medications without being cured. Even in Europe and the United States in the past, the word gonorrhea was often talked about with fear.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to scientific advances, scholars are constantly studying gonorrhea treatments and have invented a non-specific therapy to increase the anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect, making it stronger and suppressing the fierce attack of gonorrhea. Gonorrhea is best at escaping and scurrying around. If one place is cured, another place will be attacked and cause trouble. Therefore, no matter which part of the organ, it can penetrate, such as the joints, deep internal organs, and even the two major organs of reproduction and the urinary system. However, if this method of eliminating gonorrhea can be put into practical effort, it will not be difficult to eradicate it. Because non-specific therapy can resist and eliminate the function of gonorrhea, German Dr. Peter devoted more than 30 years of research and, based on this theory, adopted a special mixture of egg yolk pigment to create the medicine "Kelinong." Thus, gonorrhea, which no one has conquered for thousands of years, is now conquered by the medicine "Kelinong." The characteristics are analyzed as follows: (1) "Kelinong" has anti-gonococcal and bactericidal effects. This effect is distributed to all cells. Wherever gonorrhea is, the bactericidal effect of "Kelinong" will be fully exerted. (2) "Kelinong" is purely refined and manufactured by scientific methods and has absolutely no adverse side effects, which is very different from general membrane-permeable sterilization and sandalwood oil preparations that have side effects. (3) "Kelinong" has the functions of relieving pain, diuresis, and clearing turbidity because of its anti-gonococcal and bactericidal effects. All the above-mentioned effects are fully equipped for the conditions for radically curing gonorrhea. If you can also use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" as an external medicine, and use "Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets" for women as vaginal suppositories, then all acute and chronic gonorrhea can be quickly and radically cured.</p>
<h3>Thinking about the Future of Young People Who Self-Abuse</h3>
<p>— By German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>Due to the physiological maturity of young people, many are addicted to self-abuse due to weak will. Speaking of the causes of the harm of self-abuse, it is caused by excessive damage to the hypersensitivity of the ejaculation center, often causing nocturnal emission and neurasthenia, leading to a haggard appearance and decadent spirit, and everything is negative and pessimistic. Even though the harm of self-abuse has loosened the sperm gate and lost its astringent function, causing symptoms such as spermatorrhea, patients often shy away from seeing reputable doctors and secretly treat themselves. As for treatment, the first step is to diagnose the cause of the disease, and then treat it according to the pathology, which is easy to cure. However, the treatment must be continued for several weeks without interruption, and life must be taken care of at all times, so that the symptoms of spermatorrhea can be cured.</p>
<p>To treat spermatorrhea, you must first quit self-abuse, and then take the spermatorrhea medicine "Nailesi Spermatorrhea Tablets." This agent has the function of consolidating the sperm gate and relieving the hypersensitive state of the ejaculation center. If spermatorrhea has been going on for a long time, combine it with the testicular sperm preparation "Bokang" for men. All symptoms of neurasthenia can be completely cured. Otherwise, if you still ignore it at this time, you will not only lose your health and happiness, but it will also have a great impact on your life.</p>
<h3>How to Eradicate Tuberculosis Bacteria</h3>
<p>— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the prognosis of lung disease is terrible, but how can lung disease be so terrible? Regarding this question, we must first have a detailed analysis of the pathology of lung disease, and then we can have a correct understanding and treatment method for this disease. Originally, lung disease is caused by extremely small tubercle bacilli. Its volume must be observed under a high-power microscope after staining. Moreover, its reproductive power is extremely rapid. Therefore, to eradicate lung disease, it is necessary to have the ability to completely search for and eliminate tubercle bacilli, and the only drug that has this effect is "Bufei Naer." I have been in the clinic for lung diseases for decades, and I often feel the lack of internal medicine. But since the invention of "Bufei Naer," this kind of regret has been filled.</p>

<h3>Rapid Treatment of Gonococcal Arthritis</h3>
<p>Gonococcal arthritis is originally one of the systemic infections of gonococcus. There are many causes of this disease, but to get to the bottom of it, it is nothing more than patients with gonorrhea who are delayed in treatment, and the remaining poison is dormant inside. Due to alcohol and sex labor and other irritations, this cunning gonococcus circulates throughout the body with the blood. If the gonococcus stays in the joint, it becomes arthritis. Patients have alternating chills and fever, swollen joints, sudden sharp pain, tension and fluctuation. Tiredness, loss of appetite, the range of gonococcus is increasingly expanded, so it is unpredictable, and it cannot be effective with general local surgery and membrane-permeable sterilization agents.</p>
<p>Since there are so many gonococci entrenched in the systemic joints, it is impossible to drive them away one by one. We must take overall planning and solve the problem fundamentally. Therefore, it is necessary to make all the cells in the body have antitoxin and bactericidal effects. The realization of this ideal therapy has now been achieved through scientific research. That is, in physical therapy, the German X-ray electricity and electrostatic therapy are used alternately, and in terms of serum injection, the German anti-gonorrhea serum also has great efficacy. And in terms of internal medicine, the gonorrhea holy medicine "Kelinong" is indeed indispensable.</p>
<p>Because the medicine "Kelinong" is a mixed preparation using protein and yolk pigment. Therefore, taking it can produce anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect. After taking "Kelinong", this anti-gonococcal bactericidal effect will occur in the body in a short period of time. One side assists with anti-gonococcal serum and electrostatic X-ray therapy to help the internal medicine, so that its bactericidal effect can be fully exerted, and the gonococci hidden in the deep parts of the joints are completely eliminated. On the one hand, it also has the effects of anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antiseptic. Therefore, joint swelling and pain, such as those that have not suppurated internally, taking "Kelinong" can prevent and eliminate them. This is also something that other gonorrhea internal medicines cannot hope to achieve. And this kind of gonococcal arthritis that makes people disabled will be quickly cured and restored to its original health. There is no bad legacy at all. Diagnosis time: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting from today, 20 numbers will be sent for diagnosis every day, and each number will only cost 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Notice: Each bottle of Bokang for men and women is 5 yuan, Nailsi Spermatorrhea Tablets is 2 yuan per bottle, Bufei Naer is 2.5 yuan per bottle, Kelinong is 2.5 yuan per bottle, Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets is 2.5 yuan per bottle, Anti-Gonorrhea Water is 2.5 yuan per bottle, all are sold in pharmacies. For out-of-town purchases, please remit money directly to Haimi Deng Pharmacy, 9 Ningbo Road, British Concession, Shanghai and it will be sent immediately.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Unloading Sand and Gravel: Three Defendants Sentenced to Detention and Ordered to Pay Over 500 Yuan in Damages</h3>
<p>Since the war, there has been a shortage of sand and gravel for construction, causing prices to skyrocket. Shanghai is in the midst of a construction boom, creating a high demand for sand and gravel. Zheng Chunfang and others formed a company called Wan Tai and rented barges at the Kenye Building on Beijing Road to purchase sand and gravel from Sijiao and transport it to Shanghai. The sand and gravel needed to be unloaded by laborers, so they invited bids. Xia Zhiji won the bid with a price of 1.4 jiao per ton, but Wan Tai Company had not joined the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry Association. This led to various disputes. Some people claimed that Wan Tai Company was organized by traitors and local bullies who were using special powers to control the industry. The Sand and Gravel Industry Association also issued a notice to all sectors to boycott the company. On the 12th, when Wan Tai's goods arrived at Suzhou Creek and Xia Zhiji ordered the laborers to unload them, a large group of laborers forcibly intervened and prevented the unloading, leading to a clash. The police were dispatched to the scene to suppress the situation and arrested the leaders, Fang Jinxiang, Liu Chunqing, and Zhou Fuqing, on charges of obstructing freedom, etc., and prosecuted them in the military criminal court of the Special First District Court. The court sentenced each of them to 30 days of detention. Wan Tai claimed that due to Fang's obstruction, the goods were delayed for more than a day, resulting in a loss of 511.50 yuan in handling fees and guarding fees. They submitted various pieces of evidence and hired lawyer Jin Ximin to file a lawsuit with the civil court of the Special Court against Fang and the other two, seeking compensation for damages. The Special Court, presided over by Guo Wei, announced its judgment yesterday, ordering the defendants to jointly compensate Wan Tai Company 511.50 yuan and bear the litigation costs. Wan Tai Company has also entrusted lawyer Jin to file a lawsuit with the Special First District Court against Lu Gui, Fang Changgen, Xu Yongde, and others, the chairman of the Shanghai Sand and Gravel Industry Association, accusing them of being traitors and instigating the disturbances. They are seeking to have them punished according to the law for defamation and inciting obstruction and are requesting that the judgment be published in full in prominent advertisements in major newspapers for three days. The Special Court has accepted the case and will schedule a hearing soon.</p>

<h3>Manager of Huadong Coal Briquette Factory Accused of Damaging Creditor Rights; Concealing Assets and Fraudulently Applying for Bankruptcy; Hengrun Coal Company Sues to Recover Debts</h3>
<p>Zhang Fuchang, a native of Ningbo, worked as a delivery clerk at the Shengren Coal Company on Guangfu Road in Zhabei. Wu Xiaoqing, the current owner of the Hengrun Coal Company, also served as an assistant manager at Shengren. Wu saw that Zhang was diligent and honest, and he wanted to help him. He encouraged him not to be a hired hand and promised to assist him if he aspired to start his own business. Zhang was inspired by Wu's encouragement and soon established the Huadong Coal Briquette Factory in Hongkou, and his business flourished. Over the years, he made considerable profits. Wu's Hengrun Coal Company then conducted business with Huadong, providing a large amount of coal on credit to fulfill his promise of assistance. After Zhang went from being a poor man to a capitalist, he felt no sense of gratitude to Wu. Taking advantage of the outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai War, he used the excuse of fleeing the war to abandon his business and return to his hometown with his assets. At that time, he owed Hengrun more than 20,000 yuan in coal payments. Although he had given several checks before the war, they were all bad checks with no funds. Wu later learned of the whereabouts of Dong Jinguan, the accountant of Huadong, and obtained Dong's consent to properly preserve all the factory's books for future liquidation. When the war in Shanghai subsided, Zhang assumed that Huadong's books had been destroyed and that he would not have to worry about debts to the company. Last year, he came to Shanghai from Ningbo and filed a petition with the First Special District Court, applying for bankruptcy. His application was approved, and accountant Pan was appointed as the bankruptcy administrator. However, the balance sheet submitted by Zhang was largely false and incomplete. Wu then submitted the preserved accounting records to the court, which were handed over to the administrator. The liquidation is still underway because the accounts were mostly fabricated and the assets were concealed. Wu Xiaoqing, believing that Zhang intentionally harmed the interests of his creditors, has hired lawyers Yan Hongxiang and Zhu Ya Kui to file a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against Zhang Fuchang, detailing the defendant's fraudulent application for bankruptcy and listing the facts of his concealment of assets: (1) An examination of the books shows a profit rather than a loss. (2) The factory's income was not deposited into the bank that the factory dealt with but was deposited into his personal bank. The repayments were made with checks from a bank where Huadong had no deposit. (3) There were only 50 tons of coal dust in stock, but the balance sheet falsely listed 300 tons. (4) Huadong's deposits were withdrawn and deposited in another name, as evidenced by his account book. (5) During a search of the defendant's home by local authorities, more than 1,500 yuan in cash, 2,000 yuan in passbooks, and 500 yuan in bank drafts were found, as well as a large number of real estate properties, none of which were listed in the bankruptcy statement. Such fraud and concealment constitute a crime under Articles 153 and 254 of the Bankruptcy Law. The judge opened a court session yesterday to investigate the case and then adjourned the court for a further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>美文綢廠怠工　工人要求復戰前工資迭經交涉廠方拒不接受</h3>
<p>Meiwen Silk Factory Goes on Strike: Workers Demand Restoration of Pre-War Wages; Repeated Negotiations Fail as Factory Refuses to Accept</p>
<p>Over three hundred workers at the Meiwen Silk Factory on Xiaoshadu Road went on strike because, when work resumed on the first of this month, the factory forced workers to sign guarantee forms, causing opposition from all workers. At the same time, the cost of living in Shanghai for workers is increasing daily. After "August 13th," the factory reduced wages by 30%, and they have not yet been restored. The factory's operating surplus last year reached over ten thousand, so an all-workers' meeting was immediately convened, unanimously passing six demands: restoring pre-war wages, improving hygiene and equipment, and canceling unreasonable guarantee forms. Representatives were sent to negotiate with the factory, but without satisfactory results, leading to a strike. Later, personnel from the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council were dispatched to persuade the workers to resume work first, and the six demands would be mediated again. In order to take the overall situation into consideration, the workers set a three-day deadline for the factory to respond and resumed work at the factory on the 8th of this month. The deadline expired the day before yesterday. When the day and night shifts changed over at 7 PM, all the workers gathered at the factory to await the factory's reply. Because the factory director was out, no one could act as a proxy to answer the factory director's opinion, saying that a reply would have to wait several days. All the workers felt that the factory was deliberately prolonging the time and could no longer endure this, so they immediately began a go-slow strike. Currently, the workers are all sitting quietly in the workshops, awaiting the factory's reply and urgently requesting assistance from all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>靑年倉皇奔逃　巡捕開槍恐嚇　不料適中要害移時斃命</h3>
<p>Young Man Flees in Panic: Constable Fires Warning Shot, Accidentally Hits Vital Organ, Dies Shortly After</p>
<p>At 8:35 PM last night, Chinese Constable No. 33 from the Shanzhong Road Police Station in the French Concession was on duty at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Shanzhong Road when he suddenly saw a young man, about twenty years old, wearing short clothes and resembling a worker, coming towards him. Seeing the constable, the young man looked flustered. The constable became suspicious and ordered him to stop, intending to search him. Unexpectedly, the young man panicked and fled. The constable chased closely from behind to the left, loudly warning that if he did not stop, he would shoot. However, the young man continued to run wildly. At this point, the constable drew his pistol, aimed at the young man's lower body, and fired a shot. Unexpectedly, when the bullet was fired, the muzzle was shaken upwards, hitting the young man in the back, striking a vital organ. He immediately fell to the ground and was apprehended. The constable immediately reported to the police station and sent the young man to Guangci Hospital. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The body was then sent to the coroner's office to await a report to the Second Special Court for examination. The police station is currently investigating the young man's name and origin.</p>
<h3>傀儡邵小愚　拘解虹口　任偽「統稅局」庶務股長肥職在手專事搜刮舞弊</h3>
<p>Puppet Shao Xiaoyu Detained and Sent to Hongkou: Serving as Head of General Affairs Section in the Pseudo "Unified Tax Bureau," Holding a Lucrative Position, Specializing in Extortion and Malpractice</p>
<p>Shao Xiaoyu, the younger brother of Shao Shijun, the pseudo-"Director of the Unified Tax Bureau," was suddenly arrested by the Japanese the day before yesterday. The detailed circumstances are recorded below.</p>
<p>Arbitrary Extortion: Since assuming the position of pseudo-"Director of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau," Shao Shijun has arbitrarily installed private individuals and filled positions with unqualified people. Therefore, almost all of the senior officials in the pseudo-"Bureau" are his personal associates. Later, he appointed his younger brother, Shao Xiaoyu, to the pseudo-position of Head of the General Affairs Section of the "Bureau." After taking office, Shao Xiaoyu, believing that this was a lucrative position, arbitrarily extorted money, accumulating a significant amount of wealth to date.</p>
<p>Arrogant and Overbearing: However, Shao Xiaoyu is only twenty-four years old. Having achieved success overnight, he is arrogant and overbearing, causing considerable dissatisfaction among the puppets. Recently, rumors have spread everywhere, and someone has reported his misdeeds to the Japanese, causing Shao to feel uneasy. Consequently, he took sick leave last week and hid at No. 23, Lane 1355 (i.e., Zhaofeng Village), Yuyuan Road, to temporarily avoid the storm.</p>
<p>Detained and Sent to Hongkou: At 6:50 AM the day before yesterday (the 11th), the Japanese suddenly dispatched personnel from the military police in a car to the village. They went directly to the house. Unexpectedly, Shao received the news upstairs, realized the situation was bad, and tried to escape over the roof. However, it seemed that the people who came knew he would try to escape, so they secretly deployed personnel around his residence. As a result, Shao was still apprehended and taken to Hongkou.

<p>Shen Sun Shi: Shen Sun Shi, a woman from Jiangsu, 37 years old, residing at No. 127, Danhua Lane, North Shanxi Road, became despondent due to her husband's long-term unemployment and financial difficulties.

Soon, the poison took effect and could not be controlled. People summoned Street Patrolman No. 255 and urgently hired a car to rush her to Renji Hospital for treatment.

<h3>華方游擊隊　注意西區烟賭　期一舉肅清為社會除害</h3>
<p>Chinese Guerrillas Pay Attention to Opium Dens and Gambling Houses in the Western District, Hoping to Wipe Them Out in One Fell Swoop to Eliminate Harm for Society</p>
<p>Opium dens and gambling dens in the Shanghai West Outlying Areas have become increasingly rampant since receiving protection from a certain party. The harm to society is not insignificant. Petty criminals and lawbreakers regard this as a paradise, frequenting the area and repeatedly committing crimes, causing unrest and difficulty in maintaining public order. The Public Concession Police Authority, in order to maintain order and tranquility within the concession, has specifically sealed off the main roads in the border area and strictly inspects pedestrians entering and exiting. As a result, criminals have disappeared from the concession. However, those addicted to gambling and opium are still stubborn and pursue it madly, leading to all kinds of tragic incidents. The reports in the newspapers are too numerous to count. The owners of gambling dens and opium dens have been repeatedly warned, but they remain unrepentant. According to rumors yesterday, it is said that these dens that poison people's livelihood have been noticed by the Chinese army guerrillas in the Western District, who are extremely resentful and are planning effective measures to wipe them out in one fell swoop, eliminating harm and creating benefits for society.</p>

<h3>小學生與難童通訊</h3>
<p>Correspondence between Elementary School Students and Refugee Children</p>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>This time, we are raising funds for refugee production and education expenses, and promoting the Charity Badge fundraising campaign. Elementary school students in this city have enthusiastically donated, providing 100,000 refugees with the opportunity to participate in production and education training. It is truly beneficial to the people, helps those in need, and is immeasurable virtue!</p>
<p>In various refugee camps, there are many "refugee children." They heard that they will also have the opportunity to study and work in the future, and they are all overjoyed and extremely happy, forgetting the pain of hunger in their stomachs.</p>
<p>Elementary school students should know about the living conditions of refugee children in the camps, and refugee children should also know about the living conditions of elementary school students in schools. In order to promote mutual understanding between the two parties, we propose to encourage correspondence between elementary school students and refugee children.</p>
<p>The following are simple methods for elementary school students to communicate with refugee children:</p>
<p>1. Elementary school students and refugee children who like to correspond can submit their names to their teachers. Print a directory of correspondents and distribute it to various refugee camps and elementary schools.</p>
<p>The directory format is as follows:</p>
<p>Name Age Gender Where are you from At what school/camp Address</p>
<p>2. Students from each elementary school and refugee children from each camp can contact each other as soon as they receive the directory.</p>
<p>3. The scope of communication, in addition to reporting your own situation and investigating the living conditions of the recipient, you can also schedule visits, and schedule joint performances to increase interest.</p>
<h3>一個難童的感言</h3>
<p>A Refugee Child's Reflections</p>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>It has been two winters since I left my hometown, and sorrow and pain fill my heart. My future is dark, it is disappointment, and I am the most unfortunate child in the world.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to take a walk on the road. I saw many children about the same age as me. They were supporting their mothers' hands and holding cakes, biscuits, and balloons. They also revealed a kind of proud look. It suddenly reminded me of myself two years ago. Wasn't I the same as them? I was happily spending the New Year. But now? They are the darlings of heaven, the happy people. What about me? I am an orphan without parents or a home. Can my parents be resurrected? Can my sisters reunite? My home has become a pile of rubble, and where can I find my happiness? All the happiness in the world is not something I can enjoy... No, my previous thoughts were completely wrong. I should not be negative. My new life is in the future. Use my own ability to create the various aspects of the future. Now, although my home has been destroyed, the camp is my current home. Although my parents were killed and my sisters are scattered, my fellow refugees are my only relatives. Although my school has been burned down, the education in the current camp can increase my knowledge. We don’t need to be depressed and pessimistic. Use our full power to fight the environment!</p>

<h3>Refugee Children Listening to Lectures on Mats</h3>
<h3>Correspondence Campaign</h3>
<p>— Shunjiang</p>
<p>Dear children! Now I sincerely initiate this "Correspondence Campaign," hoping that everyone will implement and promote it!</p>
<p>The purpose of advocating this campaign!</p>
<p>(1) Is to enable you to connect with refugee children, to understand their lives, and to guide their education.</p>
<p>(2) Is to practice your writing skills.</p>
<p>(3) Is to arouse your enthusiasm for the "Save the Refugees Through Thrift" movement.</p>
<p>Its content can be broadly divided into two categories:</p>
<p>(1) Reporting on life facts—including personal, family, and social life, as well as thoughts and feelings, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Exchanging knowledge—including knowledge from books and other practical knowledge.</p>
<p>This campaign is tentatively open to senior children for free participation. If junior and middle-level children are also happy to participate, they are naturally welcome, but they must have perseverance and work hard.</p>
<p>As for the method of communication:</p>
<p>(1) Take a primary school and a refugee school as a unit, and each side appoints an appropriate number of people.</p>
<p>(2) The refugee school compiles a list, allowing the children to choose a person as their partner.</p>
<p>(3) The communication period is tentatively set at once every two weeks—or the frequency can be increased or decreased at any time depending on the needs of all parties.</p>
<p>(4) Manuscripts should be written outside of class. It is best to have them reviewed and corrected by the instructor first; if you don't like to do this, then it's up to you.</p>
<p>(5) The postage for letters sent by refugee children will be borne by the children—because the refugee children have lost their source of income and have no strength to bear this economic burden.</p>
<p>In addition, I hope the instructors and children of each school will take note of the following points:</p>
<p>(1) I hope that the directors can encourage or help the children more, provide more materials, or hold temporary meetings for discussion, so that this movement can develop quickly.</p>
<p>(2) I hope that the children will borrow more books for the refugee children so that they can have books to read outside of class.</p>
<p>(3) I hope everyone can make personal or collective visits at any time, or hold various competitions, friendship gatherings, etc.</p>
<p>Popular Lyrics</p>
<h3>Mulan</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>The story of Mulan joining the army was originally a very great and glorious one among women in ancient China. The poem "Mulan," with lines like "Chi chi fu chi chi," is known to almost everyone, men and women alike. Now the author has adapted it into a ballad and put it in the Popular Weekly for readers to sing, or for ballad stations to broadcast, so that it can be more widely popularized. It is expected that the public will welcome it.</p>
<p>(Mulan's Introduction) The male rabbit kicks and thrashes, the female rabbit's eyes are blurred. When two rabbits run on the ground, it's hard to tell male from female.</p>
<p>(Mulan's Dialogue) I am Mulan. For ten years you joined the army, and endured so much hardship. Now that the border bandits have been quelled and you have returned home, it can be considered a great blessing. Now I will go outside the door to see my comrades.</p>
<p>(Song) Mulan's filial piety led her to join the army,</p>
<p>Serving the country and enduring hardship,</p>
<p>Dressed as a man, who recognized her?</p>
<p>Now the border bandits have been pacified.</p>
<p>Returning home with a joyful heart,</p>
<p>She becomes a beautiful woman in her boudoir again,</p>
<p>Taking off the battle robe,</p>
<p>She puts on her old clothes again,</p>
<p>Her hair is styled in a fashionable bun,</p>
<p>A flower is inserted into her cloud of hair,</p>
<p>Her willow-leaf eyebrows are divided into eight strokes,</p>
<p>Her autumn-wave eyes are clear,</p>
<p>Her jade nose,</p>
<p>Red lips,</p>
<p>Indeed, she is more charming and graceful,</p>
<p>The heavily made-up beauty,</p>
<p>Is not as imposing as when she was killing on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Going out, she specially looks for her companions,</p>
<p>Who are shocked when they see her.</p>
<p>(Companion A) Oh my! My brother, come quickly and see, is that General Hua coming out of there?</p>
<p>(Companion B) The face is exactly the same, but she is wearing women's clothes. I'm afraid it's not right! Could it be General Hua's sister?</p>
<p>(Mulan's Dialogue) Greetings, everyone. I am indeed Mulan.</p>
<p>(The companions show a look of panic) Oh my! Oh my! You are General Hua, how are you dressed like this? General Hua,</p>
<p>(The companions sing) We went to join the army together, ate and slept together for twelve years, like blood brothers. We didn't know that you were a woman. If we had known that you were a woman, we would have dissuaded you from going, and not let you go. Since ancient times, daughters have stayed at home, and should not show their faces in public. Moreover, it is not easy to join the army thousands of miles away. Why did you, a daughter, go on a long expedition, enduring all kinds of hardships? Tell us, what was your intention? Isn't it just inviting suffering upon yourself? Didn't you read the "Daughters' Classic" in your boudoir? You can be considered the number one person who doesn't guard the boudoir.</p>
<p>(Dialogue) The companions are using these absurd words to criticize Mulan, but Mulan is not angry. She only smiled coldly at them and said calmly to them,</p>
<p>(Mulan Sings) Your knowledge is too shallow,</p>
<p>You shouldn't come here today to ridicule me!</p>
<p>Do you know that this time I went to join the army thousands of miles away,</p>
<p>It was only because my old father is old and frail.</p>
<p>Taking my father's place is fulfilling my filial piety,</p>
<p>What's so strange about dressing as a man?</p>
<p>Moreover, everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country,</p>
<p>Holding weapons to defend the country, like Wang Qi in the past,</p>
<p>Now the border bandits are eager to attack us,</p>
<p>I am sacrificing myself for the country, as it is my responsibility.</p>
<p>It's laughable that you are so narrow-minded,</p>
<p>Actually sticking to the distinction between men and women,</p>
<p>Pitifully clinging to the old ways and not knowing how to change,</p>
<p>And treating daughters like playthings,</p>
<p>Resulting in a generation of daughters being ruined,</p>
<p>Without any patriotic spirit at all,</p>
<p>Without any national consciousness,</p>
<p>That's why I break the old habits of the past,</p>
<p>And showed my face in public to join the military,</p>
<p>Knowing only that when the country is there, the people are there,</p>
<p>Annihilating the border bandits to secure the foundation of the country,</p>
<p>If all the daughters in the country were like me,</p>
<p>Why would the country be weak and the people poor and bullied?</p>
<p>Therefore, loving the country does not distinguish between men and women,</p>
<p>We must unite with one heart to fight against the enemy.</p>
<p>(Narration) After Mulan finished speaking these words, the companions all admired her and said,</p>
<p>(The companions all say) General Hua is right. We know that we are wrong. Please forgive us, General.</p>

<h3>"Life" and "Living"</h3>
<p>— Refugee Reporter</p>
<p>To support refugees is to enable refugees to "live," but if they are supported for a lifetime, the refugees are still refugees.</p>
<p>To teach refugees productive skills is to enable refugees to "live." When every refugee has productive skills, the refugees are capable citizens.</p>
<p>Educating refugees not only enables them to make a living, but also enables them to live a "meaningful life." In this way, refugees become good citizens who are both capable and knowledgeable.</p>
<p>People who have previously contributed money and effort to help refugees, please make another effort for the Refugee Association's fundraising for production education funds, and complete the thorough "saving people" merit!</p>
<p>Scientific Knowledge</p>
<h3>The Greatness of Levers</h3>
<p>Scientists say: "Without levers, there would be no machines." From this sentence, the importance of levers is self-evident. The lever is the origin of machines!</p>
<p>But what is called a lever? This term is a bit bookish, but in terms of the literal meaning, it is not very difficult to understand. A lever is a lever, a pole is a pole, it is a kind of stick. A hand tool can be called a lever, and a carrying pole can also be called a lever, but its shape is not necessarily straight, and it changes according to its use.</p>
<p>People first used levers in the same way as using machines. When a woodcutter goes to chop firewood, how does he use an axe? How does he use a carrying pole? And then how does he pick up that load of firewood? This fully demonstrates the function of levers, so people use levers to replace labor and increase production. Its meaning is not much different from that of people using machines now, because the lever can also rotate freely around a fixed point, and can exert the function of a machine in terms of work efficiency.</p>
<p>Now let's take a look at the structure of the balance. The arm of the balance is a lever, and a pan is hung on each end, which can be applied. The center of its arm is supported. When the weights on both pans are equal, it is considered balanced. If an object is placed on one end, then this pan immediately descends due to the earth's gravitational pull, but if an equal object is placed on the other end, then the two pans will return to balance. Therefore, the earth's gravitational pull on the two pans is equal. The arm of this balance is the lever, and the point that supports the pivot of the arm is called the "fulcrum."</p>
<p>In addition, the seesaw used by school children is also a lever. It is a long board supported on a wooden frame. This point of support is also called the fulcrum. Children sitting on both ends can push up and down. If the center of gravity is different or equal, the phenomenon of up and down balance will be immediately seen. Therefore, the principle of levers is "the product of a small force and a long arm is equal to the product of a large force and a short arm."</p>
<p>The force applied to one end of the lever is called the "effort," and the other end that resists its action is called the "load." Every lever, no matter what its shape, has three points, namely "effort point," "load point," and "fulcrum."</p>
<p>But these three points are not fixed, and sometimes they also change according to their function. For example, the effort of the balance seesaw, or the force is at one end, the load or resistance is at the other end, and the fulcrum is in the middle. But things of the same kind, such as scissors and bell pullers, are all like this—the fulcrum is between the effort and the load. Therefore, we call this type of lever the first class lever.</p>
<p>But sometimes the fulcrum is at one end, and the load and resistance are in the middle, so the effort is at the other end. Under these circumstances, we call it the second class lever. For example, a wheelbarrow on land, the wheel is the fulcrum, the body is the load, and the carter is the effort, just like rowing in the water, the oar in the water is the fulcrum, the hull is the load, and the boatman is the effort.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a third type of lever, where the fulcrum is at one end, the load is at the other end, and the effort is in the middle. For example, a person's arm is an example. Holding an object in the hand is the load, the connection of the elbow is the fulcrum, and the muscle strength on the radius is the effort.</p>
<p>But the lever is not fixed in one form. Sometimes it can change from the first class to another class of lever. For example, if a person wants to lift a ladder against a wall or a stone from the ground, the wall or stone is the fulcrum, the ladder itself is the load, and is also the arm; the person's hand is the effort.</p>
<p>When a person starts to lift the ladder, using his hand to support one end, the weight is between the fulcrum and the effort, so it belongs to the second class. But as the ladder is gradually lifted, the person's hand moves downwards, and most of the ladder's volume is transferred to the person's hand, that is, the effort is between the fulcrum and one end of the ladder, so it is a third class lever.</p>
<p>Knowing the principle of levers and the examples of their daily application is an interesting thing, because it can enable you to use a small force to overcome a large resistance, and to move heavy objects with light objects. Its principle is that the force on one side of the fulcrum, multiplied by its distance to the fulcrum, is equal to the force on the other side multiplied by its distance to the fulcrum. If a child weighs thirty kilograms, the stick is three meters long, and the fulcrum is half a meter from one end, then it can move a stone weighing about one hundred and fifty kilograms.</p>
<p>In recent years, with the development of science, the function of levers has been widely used in railway machines, motorcycles, movable bridges, printing presses, cranes, and other kinds of advanced equipment.</p>
<p>Readers may wish to appreciate the principle of levers, understand the structure of levers, and use the function of levers. This is the intention of this article.</p>

<h3>The Newsboy's Words</h3>
<p>Yuan Xiangsheng, Tenth Newsboy School</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, I was unemployed in Suzhou. I rushed to Shanghai to find something to do and lived in my brother's house. About a month later, the war broke out, and life after the war became more difficult. Everything was expensive, my brother was under economic pressure, and the family was in a difficult situation to maintain. I wanted to reduce my brother's burden, so I started the life of a newsboy. At first, I found it very hard, but later I gradually got used to it and didn't feel anything. Now I get up at five o'clock every morning, before dawn, when some people are still in the midst of good dreams, and walk on the road with many workers. When I arrive at Wangping Street, I wait for the newspapers to be published. Around six o'clock, various newspapers are published one after another. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Week of War</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops in Central Hubei Advance Westward</p>
<p>The war in central Hubei has been quite active this week. It is said that the Japanese army recently wanted to open up the situation. They transferred troops from Wuhan to Ganzhou, and from Hebei to Guangdong, attempting to invade Beihai in the south and attack Nanchang in the north. Therefore, in recent days, the Japanese army has been attacking the Hanshui River in three directions, advancing step by step along the Han Highway. One is advancing in front of the old mouth of Yonglong, and another is attacking in the Yingcheng area. Due to the full-scale attack by the Japanese army for more than ten days, Zhongxiang has been captured by the Japanese army. The Chinese army is fighting the Japanese army with all its strength, and at the same time, it has obtained the greatest price from the Japanese army when Zhongxiang fell. It is said that the Japanese army that invaded Zhongxiang suffered losses of over ten thousand. At that time, the war was fierce and there were several days of mixed battles. The Japanese army used a large amount of gas to force the Chinese army to retreat, and attacked the Chinese army with fierce artillery fire. The Chinese army fought bravely, one after another, and the positions were destroyed, so they changed to defend favorable areas. According to reports, the Japanese army that invaded Zhongxiang is still attacking fiercely north along the highway. As of now, although some of the important strongholds in the east of the Hanshui River have been occupied by the Japanese army, the Chinese army on the west bank has strong troops and solid fortifications, and the Hongshan Mountains in northern Hubei are still under the control of the Chinese army. Therefore, it is difficult for the Japanese army to cross the river and attack the west. Also, the Japanese army that advanced north from Jingshan, after attacking Zhongxiang, attacked north along the highway, attempting to coordinate with the Japanese army in the Xihe area to attack Xiangyang and Fancheng, important towns in northern Hubei. After a counterattack by the Chinese army, they have retreated to Zhongxiang.</p>
<p>(Note: The purpose of the Japanese army's attack is obviously to cut off the transportation line between Xiangyang and Shashi. The ultimate goal is to occupy Yichang and Shashi, because Shashi is a transportation hub, and Yichang can be used as an air force base, thereby bombing Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, and other cities in western China).</p>
<p>The Guangdong War Situation</p>
<p>The Japanese side transferred troops from Taiwan and North China to South China for reinforcements. Therefore, the number of Japanese warships in Kure Island and Tokyo Bay has increased sharply. They are concentrated and do not leave, and their attempt to invade Guangxi is quite urgent. According to reports, the Japanese army plans to attack Nanning Longzhou from Qinzhou County in order to cut off the transportation between Guangxi and Vietnam. The reason for this is that for several months, the Japanese army in Guangzhou has been under close surveillance by the Chinese army's three-way army and has made no progress. The suburbs of Guangzhou are also frequently attacked by Chinese guerrillas in an elusive manner, so they have changed their plans and are directly approaching Nanning. However, the Chinese soldiers are excited and have been prepared. Now the Japanese army in eastern Guangdong is fiercely attacking east in two directions. One is attacking Boluo from Zengcheng via Fushan, and the other is attacking Huiyang east along the Guangzhou-Shantou Highway, slanting out of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway from Shilong. Shima, east of Zhangmutou on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, has been lost. Also, six Japanese warships jointly attacked Huilai, and the atmosphere in Lufeng is also tense. The Chinese army in Shima is now guarding the Masi Longjiao new position and continuing the resistance. The Japanese army attacking Dagangling is also in a stalemate. The Chinese army has been continuously increasing its defenses recently. It is expected that although the war situation in eastern Guangdong is tight, the Chinese side is still confident of victory.</p>
<p>Hainan Island</p>
<p>The Japanese army that invaded Hainan Island suffered considerable losses due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army and civilians. The Japanese troops who landed were originally only the Hata unit, with only one brigade in number, which was already insufficient. Now they are transferring three regiments of reinforcements from Taiwan to Hainan, which are ready to depart. Japanese aircraft frequently bomb civilians. There has been contact since the beginning of the month. Recently, all highway bridges and culverts have been destroyed by the Chinese side. The Japanese mechanized units feel that there is no place to use their strength. Moreover, the area is densely forested and has natural terrain to defend. Some of the Chinese troops have adopted guerrilla tactics and are engaged in stubborn resistance against the Japanese army.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is out of excessive humility, or perhaps it is out of unnecessary timidity. Recently, some people have actually said, "Restore the original state before July 7th," "Quickly withdraw troops from central and southern China." What are these words!</p>
<p>Although these words are not the proposition of our highest authorities, nor are they the belief of the majority of the people, their influence is quite large and quite bad. We cannot but repeatedly refute them and denounce them as absurd!</p>
<p>The enemy's greed, inch by inch, has been fully proven throughout history. In the beginning, didn't someone say one after another: We only need to hold Jinzhou; we only need to keep the Great Wall; we only need to protect Hebei; we only need to stabilize south of the Yellow River? And what was the enemy's action? If we now say that we will restore the original state before July 7th, they will certainly not even restore the original state before August 13th; if we quickly withdraw troops from central and southern China, of course they will only send more troops to the northwest. To curb their greed, although we don't have to sing loudly about attacking Korea or Taiwan, we must at least recover our Northeast.</p>
<p>This is not to say that we are asking a high price in preparation for the other party to bargain. This is to say that we can only achieve the ultimate goal of the War of Resistance: to preserve our territory and sovereignty, and to completely destroy the enemy's greed, by setting such a goal and going all out for it.</p>
<p>Not long ago, our central government had already dispatched the chairmen of the four northeastern provinces. This is really good news: it shows that our central government has not abandoned or forgotten our Northeast, and that there is now a special responsibility for things. The hope of recovering the Northeast is easier to realize.</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Associated Press report, in the Northeast there is the "Northeast Anti-Japanese Association" presiding over the guerrilla force of "200,000 people divided into ten armies," and there is also news that Ma Zhanshan "has arrived in western Jehol" and that his "target is Qiqihar," which makes us even more excited. Only in this way can there be a comprehensive war of resistance and a thorough solution. Excessive humility and unnecessary timidity are of no use!</p>
<p>Now, if we want to talk about conditions, we must at least say: restore the original state before September 18th; quickly withdraw troops from all parts of our country! In other words: we want to recover our Northeast!</p>
<h3>Zhang Abing</h3>
<p>— Li Shaozhong</p>
<p>I have moved into the dormitory for more than a week. Every morning, when we are still asleep, this old man quietly runs into the dormitory to sweep the floor and wipe the tables. The first day I glanced at him, I felt very familiar. I wanted to ask him several times, but was interrupted by the melancholy and silent expression on his face. At noon today, this old man suddenly staggered upstairs to notify me that I had a phone call. As soon as I heard his Hangzhou accent, I asked him. Sure enough, this old man is "Zhang Abing." Zhang Abing also widened his old, presbyopic eyes in great surprise, looking at me, with hot air coming out of his mouth, and he could hardly speak for almost five minutes.</p>
<p>Really, it's been four years. The wrinkles on his forehead have deepened, and his gray hair has turned completely white. Now he suddenly met a young friend he hadn't seen for four years. What a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>That year, the first group of students began centralized military training. We were concentrated in a large military camp at Nanxingqiao in Hangzhou, and trained for three full months. There was a small grocery store next to the side gate of the camp. This store also sold "wonton noodles," a large bowl for five cents, which tasted good. The store owner was an elderly couple, and they had an innocent and beautiful little girl.</p>
<p>Although we only stayed for three months, at least half of the more than a thousand "student soldiers" were familiar with this grocery store couple, especially everyone knew that there was a little girl named Alan in the store.</p>
<p>Whenever our district team was on duty at the gate, after I finished my mission, I would always ask the district team leader for a short leave, run to the store to eat a bowl of wonton noodles, and smoke a few cigarettes. Each time, the old man would drag his thin, long-stemmed pipe and come over to chat with me.</p>
<p>He told me that his name was Zhang Abing. He had also been a soldier when he was young. After retiring from the army, he set up a grocery store next to this camp, specializing in the business of soldiers. It wasn't too bad. He and his wife, son, and daughter-in-law could make a living. Later, his son followed the army, and there was no news for three years. The young daughter-in-law also died soon after, leaving behind this granddaughter, Alan.</p>
<p>When I reminded him that I had received military training in the Nanxingqiao barracks four years ago, he couldn't help but come closer and grab my hands, shouting loudly:</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, it's really rare that we met here again."</p>
<p>"I really didn't expect that you would come here to work. Are your family all in Shanghai now?"</p>
<p>When Zhang Abing heard my question, he suddenly lowered his head, and his voice became even more hoarse: "Mr. Li, it's a long story: the ×× people captured Hangzhou in the winter before last. We didn't expect it to be so chaotic, and we didn't have any money, so we didn't escape. I didn't expect the ×× people to be so fierce. Alan was dragged away by them to do ××. My old wife wailed and rushed up to fight them, but what's the use? In the end, both of them were dragged away. As an old man, I had no way to go to heaven, no way to enter the earth, and no way to do anything. I followed a large group of refugees and fled to Shanghai. Alas! It's really…… Oh, that's right, Mr. Li, didn't you have a phone call downstairs?……"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll answer the phone first, and then talk to you in detail."</p>
<p>I turned around and prepared to step out of the door, only to see Zhang Abing standing there motionless, with two lines of hot tears hanging on his lowered face. I didn't dare to look back and hurriedly ran downstairs.</p>
<p>Fox: Brother Rabbit, take me across; we will forever cooperate peacefully.</p>

<h3>On "His Mother's" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>When one cannot write a good article, one often thinks of engaging in some practical work to save the nation. But once on the battlefield, one immediately remembers that even with a gun in hand, one cannot abandon the pen. The moderate faction advises: one should do both. Let them say what they will, we'll provisionally accept that.</p>
<p>I originally wanted to write about topics like "The Great Wall and Diligent Practice with Bricks," but then "A Discussion on Whether or Not Adultery is a Matter of Personal Choice" rushed headlong into the line of my thoughts. So I put down my pen, lit a cigarette, and realized that voluminous ten-thousand-word essays are largely meaningless; they're not as effective as the phrase "his mother's," which is all the rage, rhythmic and forceful, both firm and substantial.</p>
<p>It is said that "one can entrust a seven-year-old orphan, one can entrust a hundred-li of territory" to a capable person. But if this is decoupled from the spirit of "his mother's," it will all be in vain. Generally, "orphan" and "territory" require someone with a bit of "initiative" before you can talk about "entrusting" them. Otherwise, how can you talk about a "gentleman who cannot be swayed in the face of great adversity"?</p>
<p>As soon as I pick up the pen, I seem to be entering the "Temple of Loyal Ministers" to talk about ghost stories. So I quickly withdraw, "worrying about the world before the world worries," and before I can "rejoice after the world rejoices," someone says, "Hurry!" At that moment, I found a sound: "his mother's."</p>
<p>The "his mother's" that I am discussing here is a curse, but I consider it to be good. It's not about using "his mother's" to knock down or whip the world. It's truly because after this "no small matter" of "his mother's" rolls out, if we use foresight and hindsight, what kind of fresh things will be produced between them that are worth writing about in detail and commemorating once!</p>
<p>Mentioning this "well-deserved" "national curse," it naturally has its lineage and history. However, in the past, there were mostly "miscarriages." After the two lips burst out with a "his mother's," judging by the momentum, although there was a posture of "if I don't go to hell, who will?", in the end, more than once, they "hastened away with makeup still on," probably expecting something, or appeasing people, which may be the supreme "way of hygiene." Indeed, "why worry about mediocrity"!</p>
<p>Based on this, the discerning call it a misstep, the speakers call it a success. Let's hold off on criticizing for now, and as the "his mother's" itself returns, feeling that contemporary gentlemen are neither worth standing with nor worth passing on knowledge to, and that in this vast land, there are few who understand, who can one share with to thoroughly plan a great undertaking? So this very complete "order to strive" is wrongly and unjustly hung on the corners of the mouths of peddlers and laborers, covering up their "hand-to-mouth" existence, and succeeds, but the literati class considers it unbearably vulgar. The fact that it vividly descends into the tone of heroes among the common people can still be seen in many articles outside of "fame and accomplishments."</p>
<p>However, it is not so. "His mother's" has actually dominated the contemporary era! Decisively laid the new foundation of China!</p>
<p>Is this a new thing in the period of national character transformation?</p>
<h3>Records of the Defense of Jiangyin and Others</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>——Chatting about National Novels</p>
<p>According to "Novel Chats," "Records of the Defense of Jiangyin is a type of Record of Lost History of Jing Tuo, made into a popular novel." Sun Kaidi's "Chinese Popular Novel Bibliography" includes it but notes "Not seen." It should be noted that the character 遺 (yi, "lost") is a mistake for 逸 (yi, "lost, escaped"). "Novel Chats" also says: "The four kings and eight generals in the book all have surnames, but when compared with other records, they are almost nonexistent. Moreover, among the kings who died in battle at the beginning of the dynasty, there were only Nikan and Kong Youde, whose events were in Yunnan and Guangdong, not in Jiangyin. Presumably, the so-called kings are military nicknames. During the Su Prefecture rebellion, there were so-called Eight Great Kings, which are similar."</p>
<p>The author of "Novel Chats" had seen "Lost Writings of Qifeng," because the fifteenth chapter of that book is "Instigating Rebellion in Suzhou Prefecture for Shaving Hair, Deceitfully Burning Incense to Assassinate the Eight Great Kings," so he cited "Eight Great Kings" as an example. Little did he know that in the classical Chinese "Records of the Defense of Jiangyin" (written by Han Tan of the Qing Dynasty) on which the popular novel is based, there are the following records: "Lost three kings and eighteen generals." "(August) 11th, the Qing soldiers attacked the north gate, and seven kings died." "12th, the Qing soldiers still attacked the north gate, and two commanders died." "14th, Jiangyin feigned surrender, and King Xue died." "29th, the Qing soldiers attacked the south city, and ten kings died." According to "Records of Loyalists on the River," there was another so-called Eight Kings who died by gunshot on August 12th. The deaths of other kings are the same as recorded in "Records of the Defense of Jiangyin." The author of "Novel Chats" seems to have been slightly negligent here.</p>
<p>"Records of Two Loyalists" (with Zhang Shun and Zhang Gui, who resisted the Yuan soldiers, as the main characters), "Records of Snow Cellars and Ice Heavens" (a revision of Aji's Journey South), and "Records of the Battle of Caishi" (mainly about Yu Yunwen's military achievements), which "Novel Chats" also mentions, are, like "Records of the Defense of Jiangyin," novels that I yearn for and eagerly want to read, but unfortunately, they all seem to have been lost.</p>
<p>Speaking of Records of the Defense of Jiangyin reminds me of "Unofficial Biographies of Righteous People of Jiangyin." A friend of mine said after reading the unofficial biographies:</p>
<p>"As long as all the people are willing to resist, the country will never be lost to foreign races! If everyone is willing to resist, political corruption will not occur, any heresy will not be heard, there will naturally be no traitors, and it will especially arouse international sympathy and gain assistance. The power of the people is great, far beyond any other power. If you don't believe it, we can look at the resistance of the people of Jiangyin to the Manchus at the end of the Ming Dynasty. They used a small place and a disorganized crowd to resist hundreds of thousands of Manchu soldiers for as long as eighty-three days, and inflicted heavy damage on them. If you don't believe it, we can also look at the achievements of the guerrilla warfare in Shanxi and Hebei now, and see what kind of blows they have given the Japanese army.</p>
<p>"I hope that those who read this book will have such an imagination: the Qing soldiers and Tartars are what today? Liu Liangzuo is the traitor in the puppet government, the Seven Kings and Two Commanders are what someone Jing and someone Chuan are; and Jiangyin, which resisted them, is any county or city in the country: Xu Yong is a student in our modern school; Gao Rui and Xu Yuyang are our current rural farmers; Huang Mingjiang and Tang San Lao'er are the mechanics and laborers we see every day; Cheng Bi and the He brothers are businessmen doing ordinary business in our cities. All the wars written here are modern wars. The cruelty of the enemy and our struggle are also facts before our eyes. I hope that our compatriots will all have the determination to be Xu Yong and even Zhen Erlang and Huang Yuqi, and that our wise officials will all have the wisdom, courage, loyalty, and valor of Magistrate Yan Zhen Er. The ultimate failure of Jiangyin in the past is not surprising, because at that time there was no second Jiangyin. Now we are Jiangyin everywhere, and we will never fail. Therefore, we don't have to be discouraged by the failure of Jiangyin in the past, but instead, we should be inspired by its failure to arouse our common hatred. In this way, we will surely succeed and avenge our national hatred."</p>
<p>Because his words were very insightful, I copied them here for readers to refer to.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Everyone listened carefully, and sure enough, the alarm bell was still ringing wildly, and they couldn't help but shout and swarm out of the door. Many women and children were knocked to the ground, and cries and screams mixed together. Regiment Commander Ye was about to yell at everyone to maintain order when the enemy planes had already flown overhead. He was, after all, more experienced, and knowing that this was the target, he immediately jumped off the stage and crossed the large well in three steps. Just as he ran to the temple gate, the bomb had already fallen, and with a "boom," a corner of the Great Hero Hall, along with the stage, collapsed with a crash. Then, an incendiary bomb was dropped, and a ball of fire and smoke quickly rose from Bao'en Temple.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye didn't have time to look back carefully and just kept running towards the township office. Before he reached the entrance of the township office, he heard a burst of machine-gun and rifle fire from the southeast. Then there was a "poof" sound of a small mortar.</p>
<p>"This is terrible! They actually took the opportunity to attack!" Regiment Commander Ye was anxious and rushed into the township office, where Battalion Commander Liang was also running out. The two collided head-on, and because of the momentum, they almost fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye held onto the door, panting. Before he could speak, a sentry ran over in a panic and reported:</p>
<p>"Reporting, Regiment Commander, One-Eyed Li has joined forces with the x army and is attacking here from the southeast. Now Battalion Commander Zhao is blocking them at Qilidun."</p>
<p>"Quickly pass my orders, and send the first battalion, second company to reinforce them." Regiment Commander Ye waved his hand at the sentry, then turned to Battalion Commander Liang and said, "Quickly tell the people in town to prepare to flee. I'll take care of everything here."</p>
<p>At this time, enemy planes were still dropping bombs, and the sounds of explosions and collapsing houses never stopped. Flames soared everywhere, and the people were screaming and running around in chaos. Paradise was instantly turned into hell on earth. Regiment Commander Ye gritted his teeth and immediately began to arrange street fighting. He had carefully studied the terrain in this area in detail, without tiring himself, and knew what favorable conditions would lead to victory. He wouldn't let go of a single blade of grass or a single tree. He first used the woods that One-Eyed Li had escaped back to as a position to cover the entire town. In addition, there was a tributary of a small river in the town, and many buildings were built along the river. He ordered soldiers to ambush in the buildings and fire down on the enemy. He also used the houses and trees on the riverbank to separately ambush soldiers and build machine-gun positions.</p>
<p>Everything was arranged, and Regiment Commander Ye was about to go to the front line to inspect when he suddenly saw his younger brother, Fang Ying, running on the road with a rifle on his back. He quickly stopped him and said:</p>
<p>"Fang Ying, go home quickly and tell everyone to get on the boat."</p>
<p>"No, I want to go to the front to fight the enemy." Fang Ying said stubbornly.</p>
<p>"You can go back first and come back later. There are many opportunities to fight the enemy. We must take care of both loyalty and filial piety."</p>
<p>Fang Ying unwillingly walked towards home, and Regiment Commander Ye also began to inspect the front line, giving this speech to a unit waiting in ambush:</p>
<p>"Brothers, One-Eyed Li and the x army have taken the opportunity to attack this time. We must not be afraid of them. When we come into contact with them, we must be absolutely calm! Remember, be calm!" (31)</p>

<h3>Save the Apprentices</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>We should pay attention to the apprentice stage - Hoping to implement the measures formulated by the Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>The word "apprentice" probably wouldn't seem unfamiliar to us. In countless old-fashioned shops or factories in China today, there are mostly these so-called "apprentices." Their lives are quite pitiful and tragic: their parents, because of poverty and hunger, have no choice but to send their lovely, lively, and clever little children into shops and factories to "learn a trade" and become "apprentices."</p>
<p>Each apprentice is like a "servant" or a "worker," only younger in age; generally, they are over ten years old, about twelve or thirteen. When we walk into those shops in Shanghai, we are sure to see one or several apprentices of twelve or thirteen years old, wearing a set of old, patched-up clothes, busy doing various chores.</p>
<p>Speaking of apprentices, their lives really make people sad and mournful. Every morning, just as the sky is dawning, when others are still in sweet sleep, they have to get up. After that, they start working, and they must wait until the other "shop assistants" and "teachers" have gone to sleep before they can sleep. Any difficult or heavy work will be pushed onto the apprentice. They don't have enough time to rest or relax; nor are there any holidays that can allow them to "enjoy" a day—with great difficulty, only during festivals, such as the lunar New Year, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival, do they have the opportunity to brush their shoes, tidy their clothes, take a breath, and "play" for a day; other than that, it is simply impossible to find a second day to provide them with "play," "relaxation," and "rest." In short, their daily life is just "busy" and "strenuous."</p>
<p>On the contrary, if things get busy, they still have to do night work, and if they accidentally do things wrong, they will be severely punished, such as being forced to stand, forced to kneel, slapped in the face, spanked, hit on the palms of their hands... all of which make their lives feel unbearable. Even when it's hot and sweat is dripping down their bodies, or when it's cold and their hands are frozen red and cracked, they still have to do chores such as cooking, washing clothes, carrying children, and emptying chamber pots—this inhuman life must last for three or five years before the apprenticeship is considered complete, and the "apprentice life" ends. "Completion" is such a good and happy word for every apprentice! Even their parents, hearing that their son is now a "journeyman," feel infinitely happy and joyful—their son has "made a name for himself," and after being promoted to "shop assistant" or "manager," people must at least call their son "teacher"! And on the shop and factory side, they must officially allow you to use wages only after you become a teacher. During the apprentice stage, there is usually no salary. Even if there is, it is only a very, very small amount of money for shoes, socks, haircuts, and baths.</p>
<p>Dear readers, after reading the above description of the life of an apprentice, you can't help but feel uneasy and pity them. In fact, there are countless apprentices leading such tragic lives in Shanghai and in China. We know that the people who are apprentices now may well become managers of large shops and factories in the future, and those who are managers now were indeed those apprentices in the past. Therefore, the apprentice period is important, and the stage of learning a trade is worthy of our attention. Only by cultivating rich experience and supreme morality in advance during the apprentice period can we hope to have excellent and outstanding industrial and commercial managers and employees. Then, why should we make apprentices live such pitiful lives?</p>
<p>Now, the Shanghai Child Welfare Association has formulated several measures to help apprentices for the research and reference of people who care about industry and commerce. The intention can be described as excellent. Now I will copy them below and offer them to the readers.</p>
<p>(1) Our government should urgently revise the "Apprentice Regulations" and set low minimum standards to limit apprentices' working hours, with eight hours per day as the standard, and not exceeding ten hours at most.</p>
<p>(2) The minimum age of apprentices should be over fifteen.</p>
<p>(3) Apprentices' work should be within the scope of learning, and apprentices should not be called upon to do things such as cooking meals, washing clothes, carrying children, and emptying chamber pots.</p>
<p>(4) The term of apprenticeship should not exceed three years at most.</p>
<p>(5) In addition to providing apprentices with food and lodging, employers should give them a reasonable living allowance of at least three yuan per month.</p>
<p>(6) Every morning and evening, employers should give apprentices the opportunity to continue their studies, such as attending night school or remedial school. All tuition fees should be borne by the employer.</p>
<p>"Employers - save the apprentices!" I can't help but utter this cry.</p>
<h3>Skillful Hands Heal Hearts</h3>
<p>— Ru Hua</p>
<p>"Young Dr. Kildare"</p>
<p>Produced by MGM - Showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater</p>
<p>The responsibility of a doctor can determine the life of a patient. We have a saying, called "the doctor has the heart to cut flesh," this really accepted the error that "cutting flesh" can treat diseases, but also shows that the doctor should bear great responsibility for a patient. In Shanghai, (naturally everywhere, every country has them.) because it is close to us, we often see and hear the tragedy of doctors "neglecting their duties," this should be organized from the doctors themselves to be sound, and society should also correct it. In the film, we will naturally not forget "The Story of Louis Pasteur," the great French doctor Louis Pasteur, who suffered ridicule in order to invent the microbe and eventually benefited later patients.</p>
<p>"Skillful Hands Heal Hearts" also tells the story of a young man, named James Kildare, how loyal he is to his responsibilities. After graduating from medical school, his parents, his lover, all hoped that he would serve in his hometown, but in order to seek further study, he joined the New York Civil Hospital as an intern. In the middle of this, because of the carelessness of his assistant, a patient died, and he was attacked by society, and even the hospital was going to dismiss him. At the same time, he also treated a wealthy woman who attempted suicide, a psychiatrist Dr. Nambodioth diagnosed her with mental illness, Kildare disagreed alone. In order to understand the condition of this wealthy woman, he naturally suffered many difficulties, but he finally proved from all sides that she was not mentally ill, and "skillful hands healed hearts," even that "fiery" lame old doctor was willing to pass on his skills.</p>
<p>This is a Hollywood film, we will naturally not demand that every doctor also be a part-time detective, but for a patient's condition, it can not be diagnosed and treated based on the surface seen, this often leads to death. Like that psychiatrist, because he is an expert, he treats the patient's life as a child's play; at the same time, it is because he is an expert that there are constant tragedies. I hope this film can achieve its intended effect.</p>
<p>Lew Ayres' James Kildare plays with calm and strength, especially his inner joy when he sees the wealthy woman's illness, performed very profoundly. Lionel Barrymore's lame doctor, as described in the instructions "fiery, irritable," with his superb acting skills, to play this role, is naturally easy.</p>
<p>As for the director, not being able to handle this film in a light and lively way is naturally his failure. The scene where Kildare returns after graduation is very good</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Suez" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>Sitting under the screen, the film flashed frame by frame before my eyes, "The great project of the canal was finally completed, Mr. Lesseps rode his horse to the top of the mountain, overlooking the ships sailing in the canal, recalling the past, like smoke and dreams, but Tony's words of encouragement seemed to still linger in his ears." Yes, I was moved by the people in the play, returned home, sat at my desk, in order to write this post-viewing feeling, I repeatedly searched my impression, I could not help but immerse myself in this complex emotion, and the big scenes in the "Suez" film, it was just a guest to quickly bring up in my mind when thinking about the plot, I thought about it carefully, I only remembered that there were many big scenes in "Suez", but most of these big scenes used distant shots, which could not handle it very well in the straight weave, the atmosphere was not enough, and it did not give us a very deep impression.</p>
<p>What the director is good at is still in "leaning against red and embracing green" and "life and death parting," such as Mr. Lesseps' envoy to Egypt and the parting of the princess, Mr. Lesseps and Tony's first meeting, Mr. Lesseps' return to France to see that the princess had married Napoleon, Mr. Lesseps' father's death, etc., in these scenes, not only the acting of several actors, but also the weaving is particularly lovely, for example, Mr. Lesseps and the princess say goodbye, one of the scenes is connected like this: (1) The princess looks down from the window (close-up) (2) Mr. Lesseps gets on the carriage (medium shot, bird's eye view) (3) Close-up of the princess' original position, gradually turning her body, (indicating that Mr. Lesseps is leaving, until he can't be seen) then turning around, walking to the sofa, sitting down, unable to suppress her parting feelings, lying on the sofa and sobbing. This scene, the weaving is lively and natural, and the atmosphere is rich, and Loretta Young's acting is also very lovely.</p>
<p>Loretta Young has several such lovely scenes, Tyrone Power also has two scenes, (1) When he marries, it is obvious that the princess is sitting next to Napoleon, (2) His father dies; as for Annabella, she is even more lovely, from the so-called "clear stream naked bath" to her death, her unrestrained, passionate personality is played very prominently</p>
<p>Perhaps this is my pet love, because such a passionate and unrestrained personality is really the best explanation of the spirit of youth. But, who can not be moved by that kind of personality</p>
<h3>Give Blows to Those Who Strike</h3>

<h3>Feng Yumei (4)</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Scene Six</p>
<p>(Four lackeys enter) (A) As long as we can eat our fill, (B) it doesn't hurt to be a bandit. (C) Although we get a bad name, (D) it's better than starving to death. (A, speaking) Brothers—we are ordered to patrol, everyone beware of strangers hiding in the dark. (Young man hastily enters, sings a quick rhythm) To relieve famine, it turns out, the people suffer. Golden words, can't wake up, the hearts of bandits. (Speaking) Alas—I really hoped that good words and kind speech could persuade the king to surrender to the Song Dynasty. Who knew that he was stubborn and unyielding? I have no choice but to pack my bags and go my own way. (Lackeys) Got him! (Young man) What are you doing here? (A) Patrol the camp, checking for bad people. You're out so late, hurrying along. What's your business? (Young man) Me?… (A) Something's not right about you. Are you thinking of deserting? The military situation is urgent, you can't just be so casual. (Young man) Wait—where are you brothers from? (Lackeys) Haha, we're naturally Chinese! (Young man) Then the soldiers and officers who we drove out of Jianzhou? (Lackeys) They're also Chinese! (Young man) Aha! If we're all Chinese, why are Chinese fighting Chinese? (A) That's really not right. We're just following King Fan Ruwei. He wants us to fight, so we fight. Now that you say so, I suddenly realize it, that's really not right. (B) That's right! Why should Chinese fight Chinese? (Young man) Good! What about the soldiers who crossed the river to the south, wanting to annex the Great Song? (Lackeys) They're from the Jin Dynasty! (Young man) Should we fight to defend our country, the Chinese, or should we fight the Jin, who are invading our country? (A) We should fight the Jin! (Young man) I have repeatedly advised the king to surrender to the Song Dynasty, but the king won't listen. Therefore, I think I might as well go all the way and take this opportunity to join General Yue's army and serve the country. If you want to stop me, (draws his sword) please let's see who's better. (Lackeys) No need for that. We are willing to follow you to join the army. (Young man) Aha, aha, aha haha haha! (Raises his thumb) These are my good friends! It is said: Break open the jade cage and let the colorful phoenix fly, release the golden lock and let the dragon go. (Exeunt together)</p>
<p>Scene Seven</p>
<p>(Drumming starts, Han Shizhong confronts Fan Ruwei.) (Han) Name the general, (Fan) I am Fan Ruwei. Are you Han Shizhong? (Han) So you're just a bandit. Now that you know my name, why don't you dismount and surrender? (Fan) Take the sword! (They fight, Fan is defeated, commits suicide, Han's subordinates present his head to Han) (Han) The Fan clan will not be pardoned, and everyone else will be recruited! General Feng, thank you for your hard work in searching everywhere! (Enter, in agreement, then exeunt.)</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Spring Arrives, Green Vines Fragrant, Snow Sea Floating; Flowers Fly at Tiger Hill, Moon Fills Li Lake</p>
<p>The Shijia Restaurant isn't large, but it's quite secluded. After being seated, Zhu Ai'ren asked, "What would the two Miss Hes like to order?" The two Miss Hes replied, "We're both novices here, but luckily we eat anything. Please, you two locals are more familiar, just order a few dishes and we'll be happy." Wu Junsu said, "I already asked, they have Squirrel Fish Soup. What else shall we get?" Zhu Ai'ren said, "Since we're in a water town, the fish and shrimp are very fresh here. I remember when I first came back from America, I was very careful about what I ate, and didn't dare eat anything. When I saw the locals eating those drunken crabs and drunken shrimp, it scared me to death, because I thought, how could anyone eat such unsanitary things? But now I'm used to it. Still, I advise people to cook those things before eating them. If you listen to us doctors, nothing is good to eat, and there would be too little left to eat." As Zhu Ai'ren spoke, Wu Junsu had already ordered a few dishes and handed the list to Zhu Ai'ren, saying, "Please let the sanitation expert take a look!" It was only five or six dishes, naturally with more fish and shrimp. She also said, "There used to be two lines of poetry praising the scenery of Suzhou: 'Shrimp dishes, Li Lake moon; Orioles and flowers, Tiger Hill spring.' We admire its perfect parallelism, and it also shows that the shrimp dishes here have long been famous." Zhu Ai'ren laughed, "A literary person is always a literary person. As soon as you open your mouth, it's all poetry and lyrics. Sister Junsu, you truly speak like a book, so different from us common folk." Wu Junsu said, "Don't scold me! After the menu has been approved by the sanitation expert, we'll eat. After eating, I'll need to borrow your car to take me to school." At this time, He Shuangyu asked, "Just now, Sister Junsu mentioned Tiger Hill in those two lines of poetry. I know that's Tiger Hill, but where is Li Lake? Is it near this Stone Lake?" Wu Junsu said, "Li Lake is just a name from a story. Because there was a Fan Li who, according to legend, carried Xi Shi and sailed away on Tai Lake. Later generations used this classical reference and called it Li Lake. Now, several towns in Suzhou use the character 'Li' in their names, such as Li City, Li Kou, and so on. In short, Chinese people have always liked to put the names of famous people on place names. You two sisters came from Shanghai this time. Shanghai has many other names, such as Shenjiang, Huangpu, Xiebin, etc. Aren't all these names derived from the historical events of Huang Xie during the Warring States period?" Hearing that, Liyu looked at Shuangyu, remembering that yesterday we had discussed this very thing in the car on the way to the martyrs' cemetery. We even said that putting people's names on place names was imitating Westerners, but now we know that the Chinese have had this custom for a long time. (59)</p>

<h3>Continued Discussion on Kun Opera: Differences and Similarities Between the "Crying at the Portrait" and "Picking Up the Painting" Scores</h3>
<p>— Ji An</p>
<p>The "Crying at the Portrait" scene from *The Palace of Eternal Life* is poignant and touching, widely sung in the opera world. In reality, it is derived from Wang Shifu's *Romance of the Western Chamber*. Not only are the tune sequences identical, but even the tones and filler words follow closely. After "Kuai Huo San," it immediately follows "Chao Tian Zi," with no other tunes in between. In Yuan Dynasty tune sequences, "Kuai Huo San" is often followed by "Bao Lao Er" or "Chao Tian Zi." This is very common. Generally, when the tune sequence reaches "Kuai Huo San," the play is already halfway through. After the tension, it is necessary to relax the atmosphere. "Kuai Huo San" is a tune that goes from fast to slow, and "Chao Tian Zi" is a slow tune. When the plot reaches "Chao Tian Zi," it is another stage, and "Kuai Huo San" is the link between the previous and the following. Therefore, in my humble opinion, I have never seen another tune inserted between the two. Now, "Kuai Huo San" and "Chao Tian Zi" are both tunes in the Zhonglü mode entering the Zheng Palace mode. "Dian Qian Huan," however, belongs to the double-corner mode, a tune of the Shuangdiao mode. Although it is also sometimes borrowed into Zheng Palace tune sequences, such as "Duan Zheng Hao," the tune "Dian Qian Huan" is rarely seen. Furthermore, in opera music, the rhyme usually doesn't change from beginning to end. The only Southern opera that changes rhyme is "Crying of Longing," and the only Northern opera is "Peddler." The entire "Crying at the Portrait" uses the Jiangyang rhyme, but inserting the Jiama rhyme "Dian Qian Huan" is also rare. What Chan Weng Jun mentioned must have a basis. I sincerely hope he can clarify to dispel my doubts.</p>
<p>In the *Peony Pavilion* "Picking Up the Painting" scene, the young male character first sings the introductory tune "Jin Ma Er," the first three lines before "Jin Long Cong": "Who is like me in admiring spring? I don't ask about anything else on my journey. The wind blows open the grapes." Then follows the last three lines after "Feng Ma Er": "Rain soaks the crimson apricots. Today it is sunny and warm. Drying the quilt, there are still remnants of clouds." Then the Taoist nun enters and sings "Bu Suan Xian," with the lyrics: "What can a nun do? Recognizing the poor scholar. Knowing he has many dreams. Every day he yawns a thousand times." Then, he is led to the painting. The young male character sings the three main tunes "Yan Zi Le," "Jin Chan Dao," and "Qian Qiu Sui." After picking up the painting and returning to view it, the Taoist nun re-enters. The young male character sings the closing lines: "All my life, I've been a traveler, full of emotions. I pass by the desolate garden at midday... (Old nun, you say I'm not allowed to be sad.) Where can you find me another one who definitely won't be sad?" Only then is it a complete "Picking Up the Painting" scene. Unfortunately, people in the opera world insist on singing the unconnected "Wan Zhen" (now commonly called "Jiao Hua") and arbitrarily shorten "Picking Up the Painting." The introduction is only sung for two lines, and "Jin Chan Dao" and the ending are completely deleted. The Taoist nun also does not appear. Only the soloists who sing "Picking Up the Painting" still often sing "Jin Chan Dao" and the ending to preserve its authenticity. However, the introduction is usually only sung for two lines, and the Taoist nun also does not appear. This is just like the "Crying at the Portrait" scene from *The Palace of Eternal Life*, where there is a "Man Ting Fang" before "Kuai Huo San," and "Shua Hai Er" and "Wu Sha" after "Chao Tian Zi" and "Si Bian Jing." Now, they have been deleted and are not sung, becoming the norm.</p>
<h3>Film Industry News</h3>
<p>Four Theaters to Show Domestic Films Simultaneously</p>
<p>Strange things happen every year, but this year is especially numerous. Who would have thought that in post-war Shanghai, the domestic film industry would have such a meteoric rise? The New China Film Studio, supposedly an American company, is producing blockbusters one after another and is now about to occupy four first-run theaters. Starting from the 15th of this month, the Da Shanghai Theater will open with "Wu Zetian," completing the new situation of four first-run theaters exclusively showing New China's new films. This is an unprecedented grand event. The New China films being shown in the four theaters are as follows:</p>
<p>Hu Guang: "Mulan Joins the Army"</p>
<p>Xin Guang: "The Young Mistress's Fan"</p>
<p>Jin Cheng: "The Ape-Man"</p>
<p>Da Shanghai: "Wu Zetian"</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of theaters showing first-run Western films has decreased to three: Da Guangming, Nanjing, and Guotai.</p>
<p>"Film City" Breaks into Da Guangming</p>
<p>The Art China's newly filmed blockbuster "Film City," starring Lu Ming, is now planning to open in a luxurious first-run theater. It is reported that they are currently in negotiations with Da Guangming. In this way, the trend of domestic films continuing to encroach on Western film theaters is becoming increasingly apparent.</p>
<p>"Wen Su Chen" Seeking Male Lead</p>
<p>The old-established film studio, Lianhua Company, will also start work soon. It is said that the capital is being raised by Wu Xingzai, and the film "Wen Su Chen" will be produced under the name of United Pictures Company. This "Wen Su Chen" is adapted from the old novel *A Rustic Old Man's Idle Talks*. The script is written by Fei Mu, and it was co-performed by the famous Peking opera actor Qilin Tong Wang Xichun at the Carlton Theatre to great success. Now it will be brought to the screen and will mostly use new actors. The most difficult thing now is the male lead, so United Pictures Company has published an advertisement seeking actors. Young people (aged 18 to 35) who aspire to be on the screen are welcome to apply.</p>
<p>Studios Compete to Film Dance Halls</p>
<p>Following "Meng Jiangnu," Wu Cun's new film "Tears of Song" filmed dance scenes at the Paramount Ballroom the other day, and new songs were played and sung. The scene was very grand. At the same time, Yue Feng's "Fairy in Cloud Garments" is also filming grand dance scenes at the New China Film Studio. This film is a modern-dress tragic blockbuster starring Chen Yunshang after "Mulan," with a new script by Huang Jiamo. It has grand song and dance scenes. The fact that both Guohua and New China are filming dance hall scenes this time shows the importance of dance hall sets in films.</p>
<p>Two New Directors to Enter the Market</p>
<p>The development of the domestic film industry has resulted in a situation where the supply of directors exceeds demand. Therefore, two new directors are already in the works. One is the technical expert Chen Yiqing. Chen has worked in the film industry for ten years and has devoted himself to photography, editing, and cartoons. He has rich experience. He will be filming Huang Jiamo's script "The Three Musketeers," starring Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, and Liu Jiqun. The other is Wang Yin, who is an experienced male star. He will now try his hand at directing for the first time. The film is tentatively titled "The New Outlaw," starring Yuan Meiyun.</p>
<p>Hu Die in Hong Kong, Yu Huan Obese</p>
<p>According to filmmakers who recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, they recently saw Hu Die. Her body is even fatter than before. Although she refuses to announce her weight gain, she is definitely getting plump. It really fits the saying "A broad mind makes a fat body." It is said that Hu Die has agreed to star in New China's new film "Yang Guifei." Such a plump body is just like our Sister Yu Huan.</p>

<h3>An Account of Wang Jingyan</h3>
<p>— Wang Hongni</p>
<p>Wang Jingyan, a Kun opera dan (female role) player, is from the former capital. Her father, Shengkui, was a martial arts actor, but without much fame. Jingyan specializes in playing flirtatious, licentious dan, huashan (elaborate female roles), and also daoma (female warrior roles). She is skilled in stage combat. She excels in walking on stilts and is stable, which is rare among female actors. She was with Xin Xin for many years, and worked with Yang Jusheng and Wang Yunsen for a long time, but was not noticed. Later, she joined the Hangzhou Grand Stage and won the top billing. In the summer of 1936, she came to Shanghai and joined the Xin Shijie Grand Peking Opera Troupe, where she became a pillar. Now, one can see the depth of her artistry, and Yu Sulian and Zhang Wenqin are no match for her. Wang Jingyan is now with You Er Geng. The picture shows Jingyan as Fan Lihua in *Moving Mountains and Overturning Seas*.</p>
<h3>A Feast for Jin Suqin: Ouyang Yuqian Discusses Reforming Traditional Opera</h3>
<p>— Nie Ge</p>
<p>After Jin Suqin arrived in Hong Kong on the 4th, Ouyang Yuqian, Gu Wuwei, Lu Cuilan, and a dozen members of the China Art Troupe held a feast at Guiyuan the following day. During the feast, everyone freely expressed their opinions, forming a small symposium. Jin Suqin first said, "In Shanghai under the enemy's occupation, it is not easy to carry out any work of saving the nation under the enemies’ constant stare. Most compatriots are living a life of extravagance and depravity. Ever since I performed plays such as *Liang Hongyu* and *The Peach Blossom Fan*, the enemy has been watching me. After Mr. Ouyang was forced to leave, I felt even more embarrassed, and even the freedom to persuade others was lost. When Mr. Ouyang returned to Hong Kong from Guangxi, I had the motivation to come to Hong Kong, but it was delayed again and again, until today when I was finally able to come south. Perhaps I can breathe a freer air. In the future, I plan to work hard to carry out my own work and participate in more charity performances."</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian then discussed the topic of reforming traditional opera. He said, "Reforming traditional opera causes a lot of resentment because the taste is different, just like the old eight-legged essay opposing the vernacular. A struggle between the Romantic and Classical schools. But over time, it will get better. Generally speaking, any meaningful work is bound to be difficult at the beginning. As long as we are determined to work hard, we will definitely have good results. There will be a glorious page in the history of theater. Although others say that Miss Jin was the first to be fooled by me, she was also the first to succeed. Now there are many enlightened women in the opera troupes, but for the sake of their livelihoods, they don't have the courage to come out. I hope they can keep up with the times."</p>
<p>Then, Gu Wuwei said that traditional opera at this time has reached its end. Every progressive artist is no longer interested in it, but it also has its own strengths. We should take its strengths and abandon its weaknesses, and perform it in accordance with modern requirements. Therefore, we must reform it, but spoken drama workers have abandoned it, so for decades, they have not been able to support it, and it has even gradually declined. We must move forward along this goal in the future.</p>
<h3>"The Story of the Pipa" and "Zhao Wuniang"</h3>
<p>— Yu Sheng</p>
<p>The two companies are producing them simultaneously without prior consultation, which will create a confrontation on the silver screen.</p>
<p>Because of the "craze" for period dramas, it is obvious that the material being taken is becoming stale. This can be evidenced by the fact that China New Film Studio is producing "The Story of the Pipa," and Guohua Film Company is also producing "Zhao Wuniang."</p>
<p>China New's "The Story of the Pipa" is Yang Xiaozhong's new work after "Ape-Man." Yang Xiaozhong has never directed a period drama before (except in the silent film era), so this is his first attempt. The script was specially commissioned to be written by Chen Dabei, and the costumes were designed by Lu Shihou. The role of Zhao Wuniang is played by Chen Yanyan, who has been away for a long time, and Cai Bojie is played by Liu Qiong. China New is preparing to win in terms of cast.</p>
<p>Guohua is also preparing to produce "Zhao Wuniang" at the same time. This can be said to be a "coincidence" with China New, and they have the same ideas. Guohua's "Zhao Wuniang" will probably still star Zhou Xuan, the leading actress of "Meng Jiangnu." The story of Zhao Wuniang doesn't seem to have much to recommend it in terms of ideas, but the "plot" is extremely sad and touching. The reason why the two film companies are competing to use it as a subject is nothing more than this. Guohua is currently recruiting actors for "Zhao Wuniang," so it will probably start filming soon. Perhaps it will be completed at the same time as China New's "The Story of the Pipa." China New's productions are usually shown at the Xin Guang Theater, while the premiere rights for Guohua's productions belong to the Jin Cheng Theater. When the time comes, both sides will show their skills, and a confrontation will inevitably form.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Yanmen Pass, a Song No Longer Heard for Twenty Years</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiangfeng</p>
<p>The play *Yanmen Pass* is a secret script of the inner court Nanfu, and the veteran actor Wang Yaoqing created and staged it twenty years ago, and it is still praised as a good story. In the past ten years or so, the play world, north and south, has long gone silent. The truth is, the "singing," "recitation," and "acting" of this play are extremely demanding. Moreover, the entire play has as many as two hundred scenes. If it were to be performed in one go, there would definitely be difficulties in terms of time. Recently, Ms. Zhang Eyun will be performing this play at the Golden Dew. According to what Eyun said, this play has been slightly modified from the original eight-volume outline. All the lengthy transitions have been deleted, and interesting interpolations have been added to complete a valuable masterpiece. The complete list of the play's scenes is recorded below for the information of those who care about this play.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City Opera in the Former Capital (118)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>When Zhu Guangzu entered the mountain to steal the hooks in *The Linked Rings*, he really took a great risk, using all his skill, and luckily he got his wish. He drugged an invincible hero of the green forest with medicated wine, inserted his sworn brother Huang's saber at his neck, and stole Dou Erdun's tiger-head double hooks. If Dou Erdun woke up the next day and saw the saber inserted at his neck, and then discovered that his handy weapon was missing, he would know without guessing that Huang Tianba was night-raiding the linked rings. This could first show the Dou fellow a bit of skill, let him know that the Huang fellow was not only highly skilled, but also respected him as a green forest hero who never molested women, so he was unwilling to harm him in the dark. He only inserted a saber next to his neck to show that he was temporarily reserving his head. Although the two sides had agreed to a duel the next day, the Dou fellow had already lost his handy weapon, and he was also old, while Tianba was young. If the Dou fellow was defeated by the Huang fellow a second time, wouldn't he lose all his reputation? Therefore, after being questioned face-to-face by the eloquent Zhu Guangzu, who said, "How many heads do you, Dou, have? You don't appreciate the kindness of our sworn brother Huang, but instead really want to fight? Aren't you too unfeeling?" Dou Erdun felt he had nothing to say, so he used the lines, "Inserting a saber and stealing the hooks, the kindness is heavy; the blood feud is canceled." to end this case. Just imagine, such a catastrophic disaster, such a difficult major event, did not kill a single person or soldier, but retrieved the imperial horse and captured the perpetrator. Doesn't all the credit for this go to the Zhu fellow? But things are not so simple. Zhu Guangzu not only did not want to take credit, but suffered a great grievance. That day, after working hard all night, he finally stole the double hooks and returned to his residence. He ran into Tianba and others who came out to look for him. Without allowing him to explain, they grabbed his collar and said that he had stolen his own weapon and the waist badge of the linked rings. They didn't know what kind of mischief he was up to. After this bucket of cold water was poured over his head, no matter how tolerant a friend was, he would have to make his position clear and seek another path. Therefore, after Zhu Guangzu narrated the whole story of entering the mountain, he wanted to leave. The last two sentences were also very beautiful. He said, "The matter was done by the Zhu fellow, to let sworn brother Huang show his face this time. Sigh! Isn't this what friendship is all about?"</p>
