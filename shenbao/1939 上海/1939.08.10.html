<h3>日德義關係之剖析</h3>
<p>關於日本加入德義軍事盟的問題，本報既一再論之；最近數日，未見何種新作爲，新發展，然亦頗有足供吾人賡續探討者。</p>
<p>柏林與羅馬方面，對於此類事，夙尙張揚，多方渲染；獨於此决日本之駐德大使大鳥與駐義大使白鳥，爲本問題而會晤於塞諾皮歐；日人方大吹大擂，出賣其雷雨風雲；各國亦多側目而視，視爲國際大局或於是而發酵；而德義輿情則自始沉默，近數日沉默依然。此一現象，甚耐體會；蓋謂爲偶然之反常，當然不足以說明其眞相；謂爲諒解下之沉默，則何解於日方之宣傳；謂爲德義對日本冷淡之徵，則據巴黎方面之觀察，方謂加盟問題之高潮，固德義主動之也。</p>
<p>日本方面，昨日內閣秘書發表公報日：五相會議於午後一時四十分開始，六時三十分散會，檢討歐洲局勢，但未成立決定；故五相對於此事，將再行考慮」。所謂五相者，日本政治上之惟一核心，重要國策所由內定焉；所謂檢討歐洲局勢者，絕非從旁研究之謂，故有其未能成立之決定；此其以日本加入德義軍事盟的問題爲五相會議之主題，甯待言宣。天以五相歷議五小時而無所決定，何難想像日本當局應付本問題之嚴重，見解之紛歧，與其國策之徬徨。顧昨日羅馬電訉，謂日本駐義大使白鳥發表談話，稱「日本正式加入義德軍事同盟，俟將詳細辦法於最近時期內商就後，即可實現」；其意蓋謂基本政策業已決定，惟待補充細目，即告完成，且期不在遠矣。以彼內閣秘書之公報，與白烏大使之談話，相提並論，不幾使人如墜五里霧中歟？</p>
<p>依據上述種種，吾人尙難遽得本問題現階段之實在情况。但更得鈎稽之於其他種種方面，可知本問題初步之癥結凡二：（一）軍事盟的之適用範圍，德義主張廣泛，即三國中之任何一國，對於任何一方面，需要軍事行動時，加盟國家必須立即自動履行其盟的義務；而日本主張分兩橛，即對於蘇聯需要軍事行動時，加盟國家立即自動履行盟的義務，但對於蘇聯以外，則日本在原則贊成軍事合作，但是否援用盟的須因時因事經彼此徵詢後分別決定應付。（二）軍事盟的之方式，德義主張公開，日本主張訂爲密的。凡此二點，未可視爲彼此態度有其程度之差，蓋其本質上絕不相侔。就第一點言之，德義所需於日本者絕非對付蘇聯，若僅對付蘇聯，則盟的成爲無用之長物；需日本共同對付他國而日本僅許以空泛之原則，則以日本對於他國顧忌之多，豈肯於「彼此徵詢，分別決定」之際，決定援用盟的，不援用，則所謂原則之贊成即等於具文。就第二點言之，日本所懼者，以軍事盟的之公開而遍樹敵人，自陷絕境；德義所求者，以軍事盟的之公開，盡其在歐洲威脅利誘，不戰而定之妙用；亦即德義所期以盟的取得英法之屈膝而綏靖，日本所慮以盟的而使英法對日本成爲尖銳之對立。此初期之癥結也。</p>
<p>及此近頃，情况劇變。蓋英法與蘇聯，雖互助協定迄未告成，然參謀會議已經發動；是德義方面私願離間英法蘇聯而換得蘇聯之保持中立者，既已絕望；而英法方面於再三遷就蘇聯之餘，三國之政治軍事協定，俱有水到渠成之之象，緣是而氣勢大張。况美國與英法間之關係，不着痕跡而漸臻化境，此又利於英法而不利德義。此一劇變，使德義今後之舉措，不宜採行曩日一貫之作風，而所需於日本者，遂亦不若曩日之急迫。同時，日本在中國滿蒙間與蘇聯之軍事衝突，在德義必視爲不必要而不免包藏危機，則三國軍事盟的成立之日，德義將何以克副此不必要而危險之盟的義務。不但如此而已，美國對日漸嚴峻，英國對日漸强硬，是在德義方謀收歛曩日作風，而日本對英美之惡劣尖銳却漸至不易轉圜之地步。此一劇變，使德義對於日本之作爲懷抱戒心，而日本期待德義之呼應反而殷切。抑如是云云，非謂德義與日本有其遼闊之鴻溝也。原三國軍事同盟最初淵源於德義，德義於盟的之運用，固自操其機樞者也；於是日本所虞，僅爲德義之工具。及至今茲，以日本國際環境之惡化達於極點，於是德義所虞，縱非機樞之將盡繫於日本，至少亦虞或將以日本遭逢國際之逆流而使德義不能獨操其機樞。此其間而德義與日本不能發見圓滿之方案，則所謂軍事盟的也者，勢將長期滯留於「俟將詳細辦法商就」之階段中！</p>

<h3>張伯倫的路綫　幻想世界「新秩序」　英日妥協英國輿論表示失望</h3>
<p>張伯倫重大陰謀之揭發　英擬貸款與德作和平的代價　幷圖瓜分中國與蘇聯一部份　倫敦航信　叔棣</p>
<p>爲了保全她目前帝國的內容與範圍，英國眞是用盡了心機。這一層，我們應當加以體諒。所以如果中日戰爭，確實是到了這麼一個階段，再沒有外援的話，日本就會立即「整個滅亡了，」那末，那樣的時候，設若英國出面挽救日本，俾便仍然維持遠東方面的均勢，在我們，是不能加以苛求，指摘她是與中國敵對的。英國任何抱着帝國主義心胸的內閣在台上，大概都會那麼做的。除非最進步的黨派已經在英國執政了，那就又當別論。然而目前的客觀形勢，日本並沒有到了那種危念的階段，相反的，她依然瘋在得無法無犬，固執着要呑併中國，獨霸遠東。這時候，英國竟然出而與日本妥協，這一舉，不僅是出賣了友邦中國的利益，同時，也根本動搖英國本身的基本立塲。在這裏，英國目前「張伯倫內閣」與大多數英國人士不同的處所，就鮮明地劃分出來了。</p>
<p>我强調地再在這裏說一句；目前英國「張伯倫內閣的路錢」的的確確，是一個非常特殊的東西！</p>
<p>如果說，張伯倫一流人物的政策，和其他英國任何集團人士們的政見之間，所差者，不過「五十步與百步」而已。這種看法，是非常不精密的，有時候我們反會陷進了嚴重錯誤，容易踏進了難以挽救的危機；而等到一旦眞相揭穿，反弄到手足無措。去年的捷克，就是上了這種認識不淸的大當；以爲英國絕不能坐視她的滅亡，因而張伯倫也不能坐視她的斷送。</p>
<p>我們必須認淸張伯倫一流人物，不獨對於歐洲，有他們的特殊「路綫」就是對於遠東，也是有着他們的另一套。不僅如此而已，他們的全盤計劃如果行得通的話，那時候，眞會創造出一個世界「新秩序」的。這些事，在眞相未揭穿前，不去說它也好，因爲反正在努力着打擊張伯倫路綫的勢力，是在全世界上蓬勃着的，這一個特殊路綫，絕無成功的可能；現在這裹果說得太多，恐怕一般的看法，反會以爲是駭人聽聞，但我的意思，不過僅僅在提醒中國人，千萬記住，在目前這個世界上，有着這麼一個毒到像「赤練蛇」一般的東西存在着的事實，而從中國方面，最好的，對於打擊道個路錢的貢獻，就是加强抗戰。</p>
<p>過去兩年多的英國對於中國抗戰的物質與精神支持，是一個難以抹殺的事實。不過這，祇是英國全國輿論和民意平均的結果；而允其應當感謝的，自然是那些有進步思想的人們以及眞正熱烈的人道主義者們的推動。連對這張伯倫一流人物，也在時時反對着，阻碍着的。如果我現在吿訴大家，英國一般進步與開明人士們對於中國抗戰的支持，是經過了一番苦鬥而來，而且時時刻刻，還不斷在爲着應付反動而奮鬥着的話，恐怕在中國國內，也許還楚第一决聽到吧。可是這却是鐵一般的事實。我想這裏有一個最好的例子；（這些例子，在以前，我是不願意舉出來，戳穿表面美麗事實的眞象的）去年夏天，大家都記得，會經一度喧傳過英國已經允許貸兩千萬鎊給中國了。到後來，忽然毫無踪影地消失了。那末，僅僅是謠傳麼？並不然。實際的眞相，却是；英國的其他方面，當時已經完全同意，連哈立法克斯外相，也作了正式的手續，而最後在財相西門手裏，却被縊斃了。所謂西門也者，就是「張伯倫路綫」的支柱之一。</p>
<p>張伯倫一流人物，自始至終，對中國絕沒有存過什麼好感。如果我們把英國帮助中國的種種事實，也上在張伯倫的賬上，因而對他存淸種種希望，而一遇到失望時，又籠統地埋怨起英國來時，那樣，祇能算是我們自己認識的不淸而已</p>
<p>這一回，英國的突然與日本妥協，這消息眞是來得太兀突了！記者在這裏是目覩到一切的，所以我想我很可以簪英國全國的奧論以及大部份人士做一個證人，證明這一舉措的完全出於他們意料之外。他們事前對於日本的憤慨，事後對於他們政府的痛恨與惶惑，比起我們來，是有過之無不及的。本來，像英國這樣言論自由的，德謨克拉西空氣濃厚的國家，通常的狀態下，對於政府的外交措施，如果大家說是事前毫無所聞的話，那末，也許是欺人之談。然而這一回，却的確是一個少見的例外。去年慕尼黒會議的前夜，少數比較消息靈通的人們，是早就知道一點風聲的，所以，事後的一般情緒，僅僅是爲捷克悲痛而已，但並沒有惶惑。而對於這　回英日的妥協，第二天太晤士報的外交記者，却很有意味地寫着道；「昨天一夜裹，全倫敦不知有多少顆心。是爲着這件事而在焦思着啊！」</p>
<p>這一種現象的出現，絕不是偶然的；道是由於英政府當局這回對於消息的嚴格封鎖。一直到東京正式宜佈談判結果的前一天，在英國國內，大家所能知道的，政府對於牠駐日大使的訓令，也還是嚴格地限於天津問題的地方事件，絕不涉及較大問題。即使在東京正式宣佈談判的結果之後，這裹大家探詢的結果，也還是認爲東京的消息，要加以相當的保留後，才能接受。一直等到張伯倫首相冷冰冰地在議會裏站起來，宣讀着所謂「方式」的具體條文時，大家方始知道他們政府確實已經完全屈服於日本之前，而出賣了自己和各友邦的利益。</p>
<p>爲什麼英政府要這麼幹呢？對這，是有幾個最方便的藉口的，比如：英國爲的集中力量應付歐洲情勢啊，或因爲美國對於天津事件不願出面啊，……等等。不過，現在在這裏，一切內慕，巳經完全明白了，大家都知道這一决對日本的屈服，不過是張伯倫首相當前計畫的一部份而已，一切的藉口，皆是白費的，絕對不能令人置信。因而，照政府這兩天來應付輿論指摘的舉動看，牠的着力點，也還是爲牠整個的路綫作辯護，對於東京談判屈服的事，似乎也不再白費力氣去爲萬難掩飾的罪過作辯解了。</p>
<p>張伯倫這一决的整個計畫，本來是預備等到國會休會之後，來大爲施展一下。那時候，不用說，是完全封鎖着一新聞，進行絕對嚴格的秘密外交。至於目前爲了安慰人心，正在進行着央法蘇談判以及英波談判，到那時，大概是決定立即予以停頓的。寫到這裏，我想順便再指明一件事。最近看到寄到此地的中國報紙，那上面，充滿了路透和哈瓦斯兩社對於英法兩政府左一次右一次的所謂「新訓令」的電訊。要是一一講起來，不由你不得到一個印象，以爲蘇聯的外交作風，似乎太——用中國通俗的說法——「搭架子了」。其實呢，這完全是誤解。實際的眞象是：英法兩政府，直到今天爲止，對於他們代表所下的訓令，與史德隆初到莫斯科去時所携的訓令，實際上，完全是一模一樣的，從來沒有「新過」。史德隆早就非常難以自處，向政府請示，打算回來了；然而政府的意思，是縱使談判毫無進展，也要「耗」在那兒，不必回來。那作用，却一共有兩個；一個是藉以堵塞住德國向蘇聯提議緩衝的接洽，另一個是安慰英法（允其是法國）兩國惶惶不可終日的人心。可是實際上，德國向蘇聯直接或間接的接洽及示意，始終沒有堵住過。最可憐的，倒是英法兩國一般民衆，在他們政府把他們國家的前途，一天一天推上危險途上時，他們還被蒙在鼓裏哩，路透與哈瓦斯（假如你注意一下，你允可以看出哈瓦斯對英法蘇同盟的迫切希望。）的電訊，一部份是在安慰人心，一部份却確實是代表了英法人民的願望。據此地一個消息靈通的外交記者統計，自英法蘇在莫斯科談判舉行以來，每决英法代表向政府請示，由莫斯科而倫敦巴黎，由倫敦而巴黎，由巴黎而倫敦，再由倫敦巴黎而返莫斯科，每决最少躭擱三天，多則七天：而蘇聯的答覆，每决談判之後，第二天即可以提出來了。這是一個非常有趣味的統計，我們應當回味一下。</p>
<p>現在再回到張伯倫當前的整個計畫上去。張伯倫道一决的陰謀，是駭人聽聞的。七月二十二日那一天，此地的每日電訊報（Daily　Telegraph）忽然以最顯著地位，揭出了一個重大的陰謀，這就是最近沸動全世界的所謂赫德生（Hudson）的和平計畫。當時該報的記載，祇說，按照這一計畫，由英國借十萬萬鎊給德國，作爲「和平」的代價。這已經震動了全個世界！可是，這幾天來的消息繼續傳播，已經知道的內容，還不僅僅道一點。有更爲荒謬的重大陰謀，是預備瓜分中國，瓜分蘇聯一部份，重分菲洲殖民地，並默認德意向南美洲進出。據赫德生說，未來世界二三十年內的「和平」，就繫之於這一計畫的能吾實現了。當時赫德生提出的內容，是否僅僅這些，因爲消息絕對封鎖，現在還不知道。</p>
<p>不過，如果僅僅就表面了解，我們還是不會了解這些陰謀家的詭計的。在這裏，我想把我在此地搜求及討論的結果，再索性寫些出來。這一計畫提出之後，立刻德國就予以拒絕。爲什麼呢？德國知道，英國一面與日本妥協，一面叉向德國提出這個龐大計畫，實際上，是想在德意與蘇聯·美國·中國·之間，造下一個鴻溝，引起嚴重衝突。如果德意眞是和英國去討論這一計畫的話，那末，要不了很久，美國就一定會積極起來，領導反侵略陣綫，這是一；其次，日本是意在獨佔中國的，這樣一來，德日意陣綫是拆散了，第三，當前德國就失去中國一個大好的主顧，這原是英國一般商人早就眼紅的事；將來中國戰後建設時的一大筆生意，還不去說。</p>
<p>所以，德國立刻堅決地予以拒絕。反過來，她問英國；你的所謂十萬萬鎊，據德國所知，你眼前是拿不出的；那末，你到那裏去籌道筆錢呢？赫德生的答覆是：「由國際共同籌借。」所謂國際也者，是英法美三國而已。——事情一揭穿，現在已經成爲一個笑柄了</p>
<p>每日電訊報，原是保守黨兩大機關報之一，與太晤士報並稱。這一决揭穿張伯倫陰謀，使牠不能實現，郡後面，是有着邱吉爾·艾頓·一流保守黨的背景的。他們知道，這樣下去，不是德意或其他任何國的危機，最大的危機，是恰恰落在英法身上，所以，這實在是對張伯倫一流路綫的一個重大打擊。</p>
<p>除了這一打擊而外，美國昨天的忽然宣佈通知日本，廢除美日通商協定，其用意也在阻止英日的進一步妥協，而中國蔣總裁最近的表示，也在英國發生了很大力量，這又是張伯倫陰謀的兩大打擊。（七月二十八日）</p>

<p>夏天的早晨和秋天的夜晚，均是十分地豐富着詩意的。晶瑩純潔的明月，高掛在上空，格外顯得光亮地普遍的照耀着大地，這時暑氣已消，心情幽然，若有愛侶的人們，能不雙雙對對，情話盈盈，夫婦間的魚水之歡，這是人生「及時行樂」的表現。不過，朋友：你莫做愛情中的罪人！</p>
<p>愛情猶如花木，要牠繁榮，必須要種植在肥沃的泥土中，或者能時常的動於灌溉，那也是有益的。時代的丈夫精力充沛，他們的愛悄必能依時蓬勃，試想一對男健女美的夫婦，當此春花秋月的季節，怎能不愛情繾綣，生男育女，組織着美滿的家庭。有時丈夫偶感精力不濟，那將立時從事培補。這猶花木的必須勤於灌溉是一樣的理由。可是世間只望收穫而不問耕耘的男子實在太多了：或於早年不知寳貴其童貞，而犯有自凟遺精：或於婚後浪費其生殖腺液，不時荒淫縱慾，遂致精枯血竭，爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育等症，於是美人恩卽無法消受，那雖半老之徐娘，恐怕也耍惱恨塡膺，夫婦間頓生着悲慘的陰霾，家庭更陷於痛苦的愁城中。在今日社會上，因爲夫婦愛情的不協調，而興私奔離婚等糾紛者，眞是司空見慣！</p>
<p>自從生殖腺補給療法的研究成功，上述各症已有特效的治法。衰弱丈夫如能積極服用生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」則必能解救其悲慘之命運，而復在康樂的途徑上前進。因爲「生殖素」係由雄壯動物如猩猩，熊鹿，海狗等體中提取生殖腺素復加配培補腦腎之貴童原料，用科學方法複製而成。服後能於一日夜間發揮生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，助長發育之功能。繼續服用，必可於短期內根治各症，秋冬常服更可收延年益壽返老還童之功。此爲中外名醫所證明而推爲內分泌製劑中之聖藥。惟有遺精症者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」（永安先施西藥部及中西五洲中法等大藥房均售）以制止遺洩，則治標治本並施，收效必更爲神速。</p>
<h3>遺精症的三個階段</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>一個健壯男子，因爲生理上所產生精液久貯不用而有溢精的現象，這是不在本文討論範圍之內的。因爲溢精的次數是很少的，在數月之內不過有一二次類似遺精，遺後身體毫無疲倦或其他異狀。也有一種男子簡直沒有溢精，雖和他的愛妻別離數年之後。</p>
<p>遺精症在初起時，雖也疑爲溢精的，但多半因受夢境的刺激而遺，溢精則不一定有夢，雖有夢境刺激亦不一定遺精。遺精症之初期，則稍受夢境刺激，即有遺洩，所以遺精之此數，輕者每月有二三次，重者恒至五六次以上。在此階段，醫家通常稱之謂夢遺。</p>
<p>夢遺稍久，精關愈益鬆弛，此時雖無夢境的刺激，精液亦不知不覺地遺出，遺洩的次數亦見加多，每月常有至十餘次以上者。在此階段，謂之滑精。夢遺與滑精在治療上尙屬容易，據余經騐，祗須服特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」則卽可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，使夢幻減少，當夜即可收安眠止遺之效。所最壞者，仍因循自誤，那精關就將全無約束能力，精囊中如稍有精液，則雖在白日因偶女色，或大小便後均可有精液滲出，在此階段，就成爲最可怕的漏精症。有了滑精或漏精，精液勢必枯竭，是以凡腦弱失眠，記憶不良，腰酸背痛，腎萎早洩，發育不全，精力渙散等症即相繼爆發。此種靑年不特在學術與事業上無法謀進展，就是在男女交際上，每爲異性所棄，夫婦生活上，亦必不能美滿，家庭陷於悲慘境地！</p>
<p>此種症象治法，果仍須服「希米脫氏固精片」，以制止遺洩，但必兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦，腎，神經及精血，則標本並治，始能收</p>
<p>患者吳志仁君，皖人，年二十五歲，在某大學讀書，初因自凟遺精，繼患腦弱腎虧甚劇，客歲結婚，夫婦愛情淡薄，行將畢業學業成績不能及格，衷心痛苦，乃就余診治，除囑在五洲大藥房購服「希米脫氏固精片」及「生殖素」外，並施以電療注射，未及一月病已完全霍然，本屆暑期畢業後日前聞已偕其夫人赴港就銀行界之新職云。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎癟的女性請猛省！</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>『臨淵羨魚，不如退而結網』，這的確是句名言。因爲我們如果看到淸溪里的游魚，在活潑潑地游泳，而聯想到它們的鮮美，欲求一飽口福的時候，假如祇是呆呆地痴望，而不知所以設法羅致，那便是痴望了一輩子，也是想不到口的。</p>
<p>一個乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削以致健美喪失的女性，看到旁人的姿態優美，肉感動人。老是旣妬且恨，或是艷羨不止，這也正似臨淵羨魚一樣來得可哂！因爲乳峯萎癟的原因，在我們醫學上論斷，完全根據於卵巢機能的健全，如果卵巢機能健全，那不特乳峯自然會高聳起來，就是臀部亦必發達豐腴，聲調婉轉。性情更覺溫和而多情，同時新陳代謝作用亦必旺盛，在皮膚，肌肉，血液等部分，產生着多量新生細胞，所以肌肉可以保持常年細膩滑潤，面頬更似春日之花，顯得嬌艷欲滴，此等女性，即使不施脂粉，已覺美麗非常，年齡雖增，可以靑春長駐。夫婦生活，允其非常甜蜜，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，這是多麼幸福而可喜！但過去如犯自凟束胸，或患月經不調，白帶纏綿，營養不良等症，卵巢機能遭遇摧殘，影晌乳峯發育者。則不但健美喪失，生育無望，甚至夫婦間的愛悄，亦將發生極大裂痕，結果其命運必不堪設想！欲謀補救，必先積極從培補卯巢機能着手，據中西各國婦科名醫及余經騐。均公認以服卵巢內分泌製劑女用『生殖素』最爲對症而特效。蓋此劑因成分高貴，配製精良，故服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，消滅子宮病患，如繼續服用，必可於短期內使乳峯高聳，臀部豐腴，曲線明顯，增進健美。</p>

<h3>日機轟炸宜昌英輪　負傷大副脫險　兩輪雖焚燬但仍浮水面　宜昌無辜華人多名慘死</h3>
<p>字林報云、日本軍用飛機星期日晨兩度襲擊宜昌英人集中地點之一、怡和公司新昌和輪加拿大籍大副鄧育於第二次襲擊時受傷頗重、昨（八日）聞已脫離險境、第二决襲擊時、嘉和輪尾部被直接擊中燒夷彈一枚、而與共姊妹輪新昌和號一併焚燬、幸英艦塘鵝號駛近、艦員竭力灌救、故而輪雖焚至</p>
<p>水線以下、而昨仍浮江面、由海軍官員與商務人員加以視察、俾確悉其確實損壞、鄧氏係在新昌和輪上被炸傷、較早發來上海之電訊稱、鄧氏傷勢沉重、故已通知其在英之父母、但咋據宜昌電訊稱、渠傷勢並不嚴重、查鄧氏自一九三六年十一月起入怡和公司服務、長江英艦隊司令賀爾特海軍少將向日海軍當局提出之</p>
<p>抗議兩件、昨日並未接得答覆、日海軍否認其飛機參加襲擊宜昌、而將是項抗議轉交日陸軍、星期日首决空襲之後、英艦塘鵝立刻駛泊英人集中地點之商輪旁、而於第二决襲擊時、新昌和與嘉和輪起火、該艦實處危險地位、而仍作</p>

<h3>經濟部電令制止　棉紗投機買賣　日紗買賣違反查禁條例　華商往來須杜外商羼入　日方夢想擾亂交易失敗</h3>
<p>新聲社云、經濟部以據報告、上海棉紗開做交易、國人進出有一二千人之多、查係江西路二五九號安達銀行地址、門口懸有上海市紗業業餘研究會、樓上又懸有上海市紗業居間執中社招牌各一面、每日上下午、有各紗號及紗廠人家、胸有襟章入內、開做交易、無證章者不得入塲、其所做者爲國紗日紗兩類、全以棧單爲交易、</p>
<p>棧單成交　操縱紗價</p>
<p>棧單分內外兩種、外棧單係已有貨在棧之憑單、隨時可以提貨者、可視爲現貨交易、內棧單則係尙未做出之貨、預以棧單爲憑而交易者、買賣客家、祇須先給紗號證金若干、棧單則存在紗號手中、以作代客家墊款之押據、如遇善價、雙方可隨時了結、每包市價較外棧單减少六元、可視爲期貨交易、實含有投機性質、其方式不拍板、不懸掛、滬市紗價、即係由此處交易而成之市價云云、查查禁條例、及禁運物品條例、均有禁止及處罰明文、滬市各業商　、務須恪遵條例規定、以符經濟絕交原旨、</p>
<p>同业買賣　杜绝买入</p>
<p>現該買賣塲所、係以国紗日紗開做交易、其傳達介紹日紗買賣、即屬於查禁行爲、而在此種塲所、拋賣國紗、更難免資人利用、亟應嚴行制止、至該塲買賣、分作期貨現貨、並以棧單成交、最易招致投機操縱之弊、亦應予以糾正、當由部電令各參加買賣之紗廠紗號、將該項買賣塲所之違法行爲、尅日停止、其華商同業間互爲買賣、務須杜絕外商羼入、並遵守行規、母得巧立名目、或另以具有投機性質之方法、開做交易、</p>
<p>日圖再做　金業交易</p>
<p>大光社云、日　方鑒於本埠紗布金業證券麵粉雜糧等五交易所、因滬地淪陷停頓後、對於混做買賣擾亂市面之企圖、已成夢想、乃密遺杉村英一、糾合一般奸人四出活動、計劃祖織大規模非法金業交易所、希圖再做財部廢止之日滙金業交易、地址並已覓定四川路某大樓上、經紀人規定由一號至五十號、誘致商人、希冀早日實現、結果以華人深明大義、不願合作、供彼利用、業已形成流產、</p>
<p>日滙交易　已不可能</p>
<p>昨據交易所界某君語大光社記者、日方活動之非法交易、籌備期間已久、其一切作用、仍不外統制經濟、操縱市面之慣技、我國商人、不與合作則已、使一經失足、便百身莫贖、永遠難逃其網羅、今據多方觀察、日商擬做日滙之交易所、已無法再使實現、至於外傳目前在日人統制下之金業買賣、仍如以前之非法組織、其規模簡陋、營業淸淡、殊不足注意、</p>
<h3>砂石全被統制　前訂契約作廢　市塲交易暫吿停頓　建築工程無法進行</h3>
<p>本市各營迭廠所需砂石、皆由各帮販商向泗礁採購而來、惟自滬戰以還、滬市環境特殊、砂石亦被統制、曾一度發生事端、茲復被統制、來源斷絕、存貨告罄、砂石業同業公會無法可施、除要求租界當局予以設法疏通外、對營造廠所訂契的亦告廢止、並市塲交易停頓、前途誠堪憂慮、茲分誌於次、</p>
<p>市塲停頓</p>
<p>四馬路砂石市塲、由砂石業同業公會各會員行號所組織成立、其營業時間以每日下午五時起至七時止、同業間所有各貨皆在市塲接洽買賣、茲因各地砂石全遭統制、無貨運滬、雖經該業公會再三設法疏通來源、卒因掖力不及、無法可施、並迭决要求予以設法、俾免界內建築事業停止、而維同業行號營業、茲砂石市塲全告停頓、前途可憂、</p>
<p>契約作廢</p>
<p>砂石業同業公會昨特再行通告云、茲因某方統制吾業、本會會員等向來自用船隻採運砂石、供應滬市建築事業、如上月杪、裝船到滬者悉被扣卸、而未裝運船隻現亦不能前往採運、以致界內砂石來源完全絕跡、前所堆存界內早已告罄、所有會員與營造廠家及用戶訂立定貨契的、以致無法履行、現因時局常有變遷、亦非力所能及、曾恐營造業方面尙有不明眞相者、爲特鄭重再行聲明、以前所訂契的概行作廢、祈各營造業及用戶予以原宥、特此公告、諸希諒鑒、</p>
<h3>經政府闢謡後　金融市塲轉趨穩定　行莊奉行政府命令始終不懈　惟一般投機者依然操縱如故</h3>
<p>自財政部與中央銀行闢謠之後、上海金融市塲、稍趨穩定、惟投機者依然操縱如故、但行莊竭力杜絕投資、保守實力、並分投資金於西南、同時奉行政府命令、始終不懈、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>游資集滬　投機勃興</p>
<p>淪陷後之上海、雖金融貿易重心內移但國際滙兌、仍以上海爲中心、、並因各地避滬民衆日增、以前流入內地之資金、至此復集中於上海、界內小工商業及地產業、頗形活潑、而資金之運用、因優良之投資途徑、益趨狹隘、於是益感困難、造成投機事業之勃興、如黑市外滙套利、外幣黃金證券之買賣、各種商品之囤積、地產房屋之租造、以致金融市塲投機者作祟、故意造謠、市塲發生波動、物價高翔、影饗平民生計、</p>
<p>保富士康實力　殖資西南</p>
<p>至於正式各銀行錢莊、雖因正常投資途徑、但均不作與政府戰時金融政策不符之投機事業、並對於投機事業之各項放款、一致拒絕、而免助長投機之勢、關於自身注重保守實力、或漸圖分殖其資力於西南、對於資金之活動、力求其平衡與穩健、使直接間接、裨益於金融全局、同時奉行政府命令、始終不懈、至其有國際性之上海、其地位與狀况、能吾恢復戰前之原狀、或演變至如何程度、皆難逆料、</p>
<p>匯劃制度　頗收宏效</p>
<p>自銀行業聯合準備委員會辦理領用同業滙劃後、今因制度良好、行莊領用者日增、中中交三行爲撥付統一到期本息、亦向該會具領、流通市面、聞目前流通市面者、總額已逾一千萬元、市塲籌碼、已不虞缺乏、惟爲防止助長投機起見、對領用滙劃、特別鄭重、關於中中交三行、對上海市塲通貨、難採用緊縮政策、但爲調劑同業金融、及應付行莊五百元以下之提存、故對行莊存會庫之二千二百萬元滙劃、分期掉成法幣、以資週轉、</p>
<p>設法杜絕　匯劃貼水</p>
<p>自滙劃票據制度實施後、滙劃供過於求、因此發生滙劃貼水、今已由每千元六七元逐漸升至二百餘元、以前雖曾經中中交三行出而維持、於是貼水始穩定於五十元左右、自新滙劃制度實行後、三行對滙劃貼水、已不予維持、因維持貼水、反助長投機、同時上海市商會最近曾電財政部請求取締、並迅籌妥善有效辦法、聞銀錢兩業公會現已研究如何杜絕滙劃貼水、而兩公會會員行莊誓不經營此不正當營業、</p>
<h3>米市已越常軌　市塲謠言百出秩序混亂　高粳漲無止境提早收盤</h3>
<p>豆米市塲因投機奸商不顧商人道德、播送是非、操縱米市大量扒進囤積、爰乘機活躍、私做暗盤、視法律如無物、致市塲秩序混亂、謠言百出、人心不安、雖經兩租界當局與豆米業領袖往返接洽、穩定米市、卒因米糧存底趨减、國米來源不旺、暗盤愈趨猖獗、昨市塲九時開盤、各貨繼續上漲、高粳白米竟破二十六元大關、人聲嘈雜、不得已市塲於十一時半提早收槃、</p>
<p>堆棧存米　調查竣事</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向豆米市塲關係方面探悉、兩租界當局米糧管理委員會、爲欲明悉滬市米棧存米確實數目起見、特籌劃調查米棧存數、俾便設法增加存底、茲該項調查手續業已竣事、一俟整理就緒、即可正式發表、屆時將勸告囤戶出籠、供應市塲、藉維民食、並對於目前市塲暗盤、決心取締、</p>
<p>警權所及　決予保護</p>
<p>本市米號業同業公會、前因億定盤路米店、被無賴滋擾、轉函工部局、請予制止去後、茲接工部局復函、以本年七月七日、億定盤路某米店、送米與同路附近某號門牌、適在工部局警權不及之地點內、該購米者、僅允按照每石十五元價格付款、店夥不允、因大起口角、後來米由店夥收回、隨即了事、此後在同一區域內、並無同樣事件發生、總之、工部局對警權所及之各米店、自當加意保護、但貨物送往管轄以外之區域、當然無從保護也、</p>
<h3>萬通輪承辦　津沽駁運</h3>
<p>英商太古公司長江輪武林號　於前年冬中國軍退出漢口後、與長沙輪吳淞輪、及怡和之隆和·寶和·吉和·等各輪、停泊漢口江面、斯時遭特殊威脅、不能移動、至今仍復如是、武林輪乃於本年六月初該公司蕪湖輪傤運駐漢英風代部隊抵漢時、</p>
<p>替調回滬</p>
<p>適行駛下游新港班之武穴輪入塢修理、該輪遂代替航行、武穴輪現已工竣、定後日（十二日）晨復航、武林輪又將有停航之虞、適該公司前行駛啟海綫之萬通輪、最近奉調赴津、作爲塘沽天津間之駁船、因盛京順天兩輪、近來白河水淺、不能駛津、即在塘沽停泊、故運津之客貨、須另用駁船運至天津、萬通輪即往承辦</p>
<p>白河駁運</p>
<p>事宜、啟海錢航行、即由武林輪接替、定今晨首航啟海、至怡和洋行之同和輪、此决修理鍋爐工竣後、於前日（八日）晨開航行駛啟海、昨據該公司云、同和輪下班（即明晨）又駛新港、以後一班啟海綫、一班新港綫、例如明日駛新港、下决又駛啟海、義和輪仍常駛啟海、</p>
<h3>分幣券行駛後之　郵票處置　收回辦法極爲困難　仍許貼用比較可行</h3>

<p>郵票處置</p>
<p>問題、漸引起各界之焦慮、因此種郵票、代替錢碼行使日久、已大都汚損、按之郵政章則第九條、有「已汚損之郵票、失其效力、明信片爲特製郵簡、上表示價值之花紋、有汚損時、亦同、」之規定也、大通社記者、以此事關係民間、</p>
<p>利害綦鉅</p>
<p>爰於咋日上午、訪謁郵政管理局帮辦王偉生氏、記者即以此項郵票之處置問題爲問、據王氏談、本人對此事、以私人立塲言、與民間極表同情、即本人之家庭、亦將有是種郵票也、惟就郵局立塲言、則格於郵政章程、其屬汚損郵票、當然失其效力、</p>
<p>不能貼用</p>
<p>於任何郵件上、而王氏言雖如是、第當記者以郵票而至代替錢幣行使、不可謂非中國幣制上一大變、當時手訂郵政章程者、未必爲其始料所及、故此種變態事實、不可無合於情理上之變通處置也、王氏對此、於記者提出假如有合法團體、向郵局</p>
<p>提供意見</p>
<p>時、郵局將吾予以接受一點、則表示郵局自必衷心樂於接受、惟須轉呈郵政最高當局核示云、記者繼訪支局管理組長黃寶華、渠對此事、亦表示同情、惟於將郵票收回一點、認爲困難、因如一分郵票、其印刷成本、並不下於票面價值、則此種損失、自難由郵局負担、惟</p>
<p>仍許貼用</p>
<p>比較可行、但照目前情况、不乏以已經蓋戳之廢棄郵票、用水澆刷、而仍作僞行使者、故深恐於鑑別眞僞上、亦有問題、黃君並聲明、以上所談、純屬私人性質、因此事在未經覓得解决方法前、不便有所表示、</p>

<h3>紗花　廣幫放價搜羅　雙馬紗做到七百元</h3>
<p>紗市續見升騰、形勢雖猛、不過僅係二十支雙馬一牌、大有紗荒之象、其他牌子棉紗趨勢極其溫和、查雙馬何以如此獨見在漲、則由於二十支特金城紗早已飛漲達六百九十元至七百元、昔日雙馬與金城紗市價之比例、相差均在五元至十元間、最近以來、要拔開百元之數、至於銷路方面亦處在同等地位、而金城出了高價、且購現殊感困難、於是港帮對於雙馬放價在拖、人心激動、一般投機家及金融界趨炎附勢、漲風乃出於意外、然此種情况、開紗業有史以來之新錄也、</p>
<p>現紗晨初即狂跳十元至二十元、雙馬外棧貨價為六百七十元至八十元、棧單價較爲和平、在六百二十九兀至四十一元、少頃市塲傳言、外匯改縮、買風瀰漫、一般呌喊者如醉如在、須臾間二十支雙馬廣帮亦抬價吸收、做到七百元、棧單價爲六百四十七元、旋以漲力未免鋒鋩、引起獲利者吐出、回挫十餘元收盤、查半日間成交一千三百六十五包、又日上午後成交七百五十五包、雙馬漲三十五元、特金城僅漲五元、牧羊漲十元、其他新牌紗漲五元、今日有棉紗八百七十件運香港、又二百件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、香港七五〇天津九五同行五二〇統計一、三六五</p>
<p>日紗市面開盤尚和平、但以後聞華紗市場漲風大熾、市價跟進、二十支月琴紗本月份價爲四百九十八元、回小至九十五元、不到一刻間、漲出五百元關外、爲五百零二元、</p>
<h3>廠方有減工計劃　棉花售價鬆動　同業開始訂美棉</h3>

<p>另訊、滬埠外匯交易、各同葉間聞及廠方將有減工之舉、故棉花售價、已轉鬆動、同業交易尚稱熱鬧、日來雖紗價飛騰、但原棉高漲、除永安之金城及申九之雙馬、尚能獲得薄利外、其他各廠之出品成本均高過售價、允以小廠之新牌紗爲最、故莫不呌苦離天、故大部廠方均有减工之計劃也、棉市價、紐的棉市、晨初殊爲平靜、政府棉產報告爲一千一百四十一萬二千包、較之昨日預沒者、尚少十三萬包、市價遂漲、惟因利物浦及孟買來電下落、而將此利多之良好消息抵消、因之引起投機者之拋賣及多頭獲利了結、及傳來久旱之Texas昨已得雨矣，市價因之下況、結果較之日前跌十五磅間、印度連同預測跌二羅比、埃及漲六磅　、</p>

<h3>蜜蜂型的文章</h3>
<p>— 陳友琴</p>
<p>羅馬詩人曾留下了一種名言，說是：「詩銘這種文體，如果要能寫得好，應該備有合乎蜜蜂所具有的三個條件。一刺，二蜜，三是小身體。」</p>
<p>時至今日，不但詩銘之類的文章要備羅馬詩人所說的三個條件了，生事日繁，時間日益寶貴，人們的生活緊張，緊張到連靠沙發讀說部的餘裕也沒有了，於是乎小身體的文章乃切合時耍。編報紙副刊的先生，沒有一個不在稿的上再三可嚀着說：「來稿以短潔爲宜，勿過千字。」甚至編雜誌的先生們，也需要三千字至五千字以內的短文了，太長了，連續刋載下去，編者讀者，兩不方便，「小身體」之受歡迎，不是例外的幸運，乃屬於時勢的要求。何况在抗戰期間紙張太貴，文短省紙，更合於經濟的條件呢？</p>
<p>其决是刺，沒有刺的作品，其病在柔軟而無骨，其態必諂媚而可憎，倘若三百篇有「美」而無「刺」，早就眞該把他丟到毛坑裹去了，還留得到今天嗎？箴銘之類的文章以刺人爲最大任務，更是顯然。蜜蜂的刺，本是它防衛自己的武器，可是沒有刺，它就不能很悠然地去做工，也就不能替人類增加額外收穫的營養料。</p>
<p>其次是蜜，蜂蜜，誰不愛吃，這正同好的文學作品人人愛看是一樣的。蜜蜂辛辛苦苦地釀出蜜來，結果給人們一古腦兒拿去吃了，還被吃的人咂咂嘴批評什麼不甜不香或者不好吃，其實他們自己是不會釀蜜不負責任的。吃得好，稱贊一下，究竟也無補於蜜蜂。</p>
<p>蜜蜂究竟「爲誰辛苦爲誰忙」呢？不過因爲它們生性如此，釀蜜作工，是它們的本分罷了。文學者和蜜蜂一樣，木來也應該是爲別人而勞動，爲社會而勞動的。</p>
<p>據養蜂家告訴我，蜜蜂必須在花木極盛的地方，纔會繁殖，纔會做出很好的作品來，纔會給養蜂家極多極大的收成。</p>
<p>今日從事於文學的人們，那兒是花木極盛的地方呢？沒有多量的花粉，便釀不出好的蜜來，想也是當然的事。（允其是身居內地的作家，買不到新的好的書報，正和蜜蜂採不到花粉是一樣的情形。）</p>
<p>記得前幾年葉紹鈞先生寫過一篇「養蜂」，他譏刺養意大利蜂種的新事業家，並不即實行採蜜，致使養蜂成爲空虛的事業。這好比一般好高騖遠的朋友，專會批評某副刊的文章不好，某雜誌上的文章太壞，甚至說是一無價值的，結果，他們自己也釀不出一點點好蜜來給人家嘗當。</p>
<p>一刺，二蜜，三是小身體的文章作家，是和「吃力不討好」的蜜蜂，有同等的遭際和命運啊。</p>
<h3>德國勞動集中營（下）</h3>
<p>— 謀周譯</p>
<p>九百個犯人從事開掘意斯托惠近的沼地，把它掘到兩三碼深。喬裝農工部官員的「衝鋒隊」也在那裏，看有沒有人挺起背來。兩個看守者審查每一個犯人所做的工作，而懲罰那些所謂偷懶者。在所想出來的罰法上，看守者顯出了他們奇特的幽默性：他們呌犯人蹺起脚趾一直朝太陽站着，跳過闊得跳不過的溝渠，以致他墜了下去。在排水渠的邊緣上，他們强迫犯人做出一連串奇形怪狀的動作來。如果犯人自己不跌到渠裏去，看守者就把他推落完事。</p>
<p>不顧犯人的年紀，氣力，或是身體如何，每人分派到的工作，都是一樣的多少。工作是以掘好的地面而計算的。但是有時候第一層地土祇蓋着薄薄的一層沼澤，在別的地方，沼澤却有三四碼深。有時，沼澤裏還埋着必須被掘起來的樹身。可是看守者却不爲這些小事而麻煩自己。那個沒有完成分派給他的工作的不幸者，就呌他到「監視所」裏去工作。</p>
<p>對於不慣戶外生活的衰弱的犯人，起初幾天的苦工是可怕的。但是過了幾時，求生的天性得到了勝利。犯人逐漸習慣了。在起初的幾星期裏，差不多沒有一個犯人，不是雙手血肉糢糊的，　柄被血染紅的</p>
<p>然而最可怕的，還是「監視所，」它就是多數慘殺案子所發生的地方。凡是刑期在五年以上的都被歸入了道一個所裹。德國當局對於政治犯所判的重刑，使「監視所」裏永遠不會缺少大量的政治犯。那裏的一切工作，必須以高速度完成。從一九三八年的正月到同年的四月十五日，意斯托惠近的「監視所」裏槍殺了無數的犯人</p>
<p>「監視所」的一個特別組，就是「運便組」，它必須掃淸厠所裏的污物，把它裝上容量二百公升的糞車而運到新近掘好的地方。推糞車的，是八個犯人。派到這一號工作的，是那些請求過醫治而被醫生認爲假病者的犯人。凡是熱度沒有達到一百另一度的，當他跑近醫生的面前，他立刻被認爲是假病者。這樣，就發生了下列的一件事情：——馬克斯。畢爾斯克（Marx　PIRSCH）——他患着沉重的腎臟病——被歸入了「運便組」。被迫得絕望了，他請求監視那一組的看守者邁克立斯（Michalis）槍決他。一當然，你所做的一切都是想設法逃走，」後者回答說。畢爾斯克轉來轉去，躊躇不定，而當他還沒有走開五碼之遙的時候，一槍巳經放出來了。「在想逃走時被槍殺的，」看守者報告他的長官說。報上却連這一個報告都沒有。</p>
<p>在畢爾期克死後的幾天，又發生了一件慘殺案：——「監視所」裏的一個犯人，被看守者隨意揀了出來，被當作一個逃犯。爲了懲罰他起見，看守者命他不斷地從一個哨崗奔到另一個哨崗。一偭哨兵戲弄地阻止他奔到第二個哨兵那一裏去，祇許他朝另外一個方向一跑。忽然瞭望台上傳來了機關槍的劈劈拍拍聲，又一條性命被送掉了。</p>
<p>罪犯集中營大都設在離開荷蘭邊疆祇有三哩路的地方，而且犯人常常就在邊界上工作。然而警備是十分的嚴密，所以難得有犯人逃走。兩三年前在那個地方所完成的第一個計劃，就是在邊界上敷設一條公路。瞭望台分設在公路上，並且有着經常的巡邏隊。一發現犯人失蹤，整個邊界上的巡邏隊就動員找尋。</p>
<p>在一九三六年的春天，當犯人在離開荷蘭邊疆祇有一百碼的紐薩斯德羅與奧博浪琴（Oberlangen）之間工作的時候，有三個人企圖逃亡。兩個被槍彈打中而倒在德國土地上。第三個設法越過了國境，却沒有被荷蘭當局找着。好幾個月過去了。收割期到了。在收割的時候，荷蘭的農夫在草墓中發現了一具仍舊穿着罪犯號衣腐壞的屍體。這一個犯人是頸上中了一彈而流血身死的</p>
<p>這些情形使許多犯人陷入了絕望的深淵，所以他們自戕起來——有時斬去幾個手指，有時斬去整只手。爲了這個緣故，從前在營裏十分普通的斧頭，現在幾乎看不到了。但是那些鐵鏟（爲了開掘沼地起見，它們必須是十分鋒利的）可以容易地用來代替斧頭。當惡名四播的施卡福（Schaefer）前任奥藍尼恩堡Oranienberg）集中營營長）被調來指揮延姆斯營的營務時，他立刻佈告說。。就是殘廢的犯人，也仍須在沼地的營裹工作。特別的工具也被設計出來了，所以連祇有一只手的犯人都可以在沼地工作。此外，自戕者還耍受到在「監視所」裏工作三個月的刑罰。可是自戕事件繼續增加着。單是在一九三七年的八月裏，就登記了二十四件。</p>
<p>雖則有着這些恐怖，然而喪失勇氣的政治犯仍是不多。他們咬緊自己的牙齒，而忍受着一切。他們以一種希　增加了自己的勇氣；那一種希望，就是一個總算賬的日午總會破曉的。（譯自Magazine　Digeat）</p>
<h3>鷗之夢</h3>
<p>— 葉筱嘉</p>
<p>一點白星，直向波濤投去。白的浪花湔着白的羽毛，畫一個圓，翻個滾，周遭激起白色的泡沫。該格外的潔白了—翅膀上的羽翮，胸背上的柔毛。</p>
<p>突然飛起了！一圈白色的圓暈，懸在澄靑天幕下。伸直兩翅，背負靑天，下臨大海，瞑目隨風畫圈；聽濤聲輕歌，幽泣</p>
<p>它把目閉得更緊，圓圈畫得格外輕　。在想，在想一個美麗的夢。如它現在般的：沒有塵俗，呌囂，灰埃，烟陣……無限純靜，無限潔美：似披羽衣帶桂冠的詩人，花下對月吟哦。</p>
<p>「唔！」它輕快的笑了！又該向波裏打個滾兒去！</p>
<p>忽然，一種奇怪的聲響，使它遲疑了飛行角度。細聽：决不像同類的高歌，也不似浪花的呌喊。這聲音是不平常的。</p>
<p>它儘着視力搜求，始發見到遠遠的一點黑影。迎上去。</p>
<p>漸漸近了，漸漸大了！是件長方形的勞什子，上面還有些高出的細條條，直指大空，迎風破浪，向前邁進。頭迎着浪的襲擊，尾將浪兩處分開。</p>
<p>「這個蠢東西，它敢駛到這聖地來！」有點憤怒了，它迎上</p>
<p>挨到目的物上空時，以脫弦之矢的急勢，垂直的墜下去！</p>
<p>一咕！咕！蠢物在吼了。一陣熱暈，使它微顫：趕緊飛起，腹背覺得有點粘膩。怪物上籠着團團的黑霧。</p>
<p>它反視自身，如雪　羽毛上竟沾了點點黑星。</p>
<p>它飛投海波，努力剔除，洗湔</p>
<p>再度飛起時，純白的處所染成灰色，黑的竟淡了許多。</p>
<p>怪聲的東西，影子已遠已淡，漸漸的，漸漸的，不見了。</p>
<p>淚懸上它的眼角。它想到潔白的羽衣，感到夢的悽哀。</p>
<p>海在呼嘯了！長空仍一碧如洗。</p>
<p>老丈攜孩兒歩向官前憩　獨陳淪陷悲感激且流涕</p>
<p>— 次愷</p>
<h3>離別草</h3>
<p>— 雷大芬</p>
<p>我不知離愁是淡淡地哀怨如輕雲，還是像夢裏的惆悵？</p>
<p>不是送友人長征或是跟愛人生離，而是整年整月厮混在一塊兒的同學，一天爲了傳統的習慣—說是畢業了，遂决然的東西分飛了。它不足以使你傷心得嗚咽，流淚，伏在桌子上聳着肩胛，而是一種輕微的感傷；但卻老纏著你，不肯放鬆，如長長的絲帶。</p>
<p>天下沒有不散的筵席，前人的話對的。留戀什麼，大踏着步奔向前去吧！朋友的言語更不錯。可惜我沒有那種達觀的胸襟。一個平凡的人是有着過多的可哀的。</p>
<p>在人生的途程上，我們走到了一個分歧的路口，於是彼此說着道別的話語。。</p>
<p>「再見。」</p>
<p>大家都替自己織好了一個夢，期待着驚奇：他鄉遇故知</p>
<p>但，我更記起了眼前年靑的人該走的道路。活在苦難的時代裏，年靑的人要在戰鬥中成長，要投進風暴中去。祖國在向我們親切的招手呵：「來啊！去吧！」</p>
<p>陳不久將飄過海到遼遠遼遠的地方去了。有人說：「陳，你是幸福的孩子。」「非常慚愧，在這樣的時代裏，眞不該離賂祖國。」陳苦笑着說。</p>
<p>我憶起另外友人的詩句：</p>
<p>「在遠方有你日夜祈禱着的光明。」</p>
<h3>簷溜</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>散文</p>
<p>我們還都習於說這樣慣口的句子：「生活永遠是散文，沒有一行詩；」咀咒着一串串平凡，鬆懶，散漫的日子。許是渴望一顆露珠樣的新山，許是嚮往在濤般的動盪和緊張。</p>
<p>日子從太息聲中，從手指尖上悄悄地滑過去了。一旦想起來，誰都說是一個損失。然而，難道是能撈回來的嗎？</p>
<p>於是人們又會說：於我如浮雲。散文，散文，永遠地散文下去了。</p>
<p>要像詩嗎？首先得樹起生活的規律來。</p>
<h3>答一個孩子的問</h3>
<p>— S.T.Coleridge作錫金譯</p>
<p>是你問那些鳥兒說什麼？那麻雀，那鴿子，</p>
<p>那紅雀和畫眉說，「我愛和我愛！」</p>
<p>在冬天他們沉默了了——那風刮得這末兇；</p>
<p>牠說什麼，我不知道，祇是牠唱個大聲的歌。</p>
<p>但到綠葉，和花兒，和陽光溫暖的氣候，</p>
<p>那些歌唱，那些愛——一夥兒全都回來。</p>
<p>這是天鷚如此的爲愛和歡喜充滿，</p>
<p>下面臨着綠野，上面負着靑天，</p>
<p>他唱着，他這麼唱着，並且他一直唱——　　「我愛我的愛，我的愛也愛我！」</p>

<h3>「夜上海」的演出</h3>
<p>— 泡沫</p>
<p>沉寂了相當時間的上海劇藝社，終於用了簇新的姿態，在璇宮劇塲演出了。</p>
<p>擁有上海劇壇優秀劇作家，導演，演員，及一切技術人材的劇藝社，在他們成長中的一年中間，正如他們自己所說：「為了得不到演出塲所，我們曾經佈過「背水陣」，冒險地在平劇封箱了的年關關口內，包過「卡爾登」院子；我們也作過「塹壕戰」，退守地在電影卡通塲的星期早晨，租「新光」來舉行連續十二個星期天早塲的實騐演出。」</p>
<p>假如正如他們自己所說，在戰鬥了一年來的劇劇劇藝社眞佈過「背水陣」和「塹壕戰」的話，那麼，這次劇劇劇藝社改成了職業劇團，租定了戲院，凖備長期公演的計劃，應該是建立了堡壘，作長時間的「陣地戰」吧。</p>
<p>實在的，無論由那一面說，經歷了困難重重千辛萬苦的上海劇藝社，在這苦門的一年中間，她的確變得更堅强，更健壯了。因此，對於上海劇藝社這次的演出，是應該致相當的敬意的。這次公演的劇劇劇目，是于伶先生繼「女子公寓」。及「花濺淚」以後的新作。為了便於演出，為了趕付排演，「夜上海」能够在這短時間以內和我們相見，這的確是値得欣喜的。</p>
<p>「夜上海」在義上講，應該是最寫實的力作。于伶先生的全部作品中間，把戰後所有在素材，統統都彙合起來，在飽嘗了辛酸苦辣的上海人，看到了「夜上海」的演出，該會發生無限的感喟的吧。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們看見有南市鐵柵飛擲燒餅油條的景緻；（演出時已刪去）有買不到米排着隊站在米店門口的速寫；有銅元缺乏，拿郵票代用最新的現像；有和小鬚子作「通商」「貿易」喫子彈的傢伙；也有凶狠毒辣比殺人還狠的二房東；也有為了付不出房金出賣聖處女的悲劇……，有為了生活下海伴舞的女學生……。</p>
<p>看起來像是喜劇，實際每一幅盡，每一樣素材，都是在彫擊着一幅最悲壯的悲劇。</p>
<p>關於于伶先生的作風及技術，我不願在這裏多談。不過我個人感覺，「夜上海」包容的素材雖多，事實雖新鮮，但它不够戲劇化，戲的發展始終很平，它沒有伏綫，沒有高潮，我們與其說「夜上海」是一齣悲壯的悲劇，還不如說它是一首凄凉的散文詩。這正如李健吾先生所說：于伶先生自己有着「詩情的心靈」與「銳敏的感受」。但它能够使這些詩情與感受組織化，戲劇化，那麼「夜上海」的演出，一定能獲得更高的收穫的。</p>
<p>為了劇本的限制以及部份的被刪去，「夜上海」的演出，究竟受了很多影響。</p>
<p>全劇的調子，以這樣的題材，我以為還應當更加快一些，也許因為是獻演，（星期日晚塲）演員都感覺生疏吧。</p>
<p>演員中間，徐立的錢愷之，很穩重；柏李的梅綦輝，能加强羞澀少女的風采，一定會好得多；蘭藍的吳姬，出塲時間太短，有的戲，相當穩健而已，潑辣的味道，能够再乾脆一點就好了；維拉的後母，到是很合個性的演員；唐玄凡的孫煥君，一種奸刁相，外型很好，但動作對白有時太慢了；文飄的雲姑，是新人中問很成功的一個；葉小梅的小雲，口齒很淸楚；王邢絮發音太低，動作還應該誇張一點，一種沉鬱的氣氛，不够明鮮；梅珠的錢毅很穩·能够再老練一點就好了；丁芝的馮鳳及慕容婉兒的房東太太都還好。</p>
<p>這篇東西，只能算是個人的觀感。</p>

<p>— 肖傖</p>
<p>—實爾墩盜馬時投書之研究</p>
<p>言菊朋臨雖最後一天之日戲，高盛麟裘盛戎之全本連環套，裏盛戎飾寶爾墩，於下山盜馬時，率馬從下塲門出塲，其投信之表演，一如金少山之將信任意投擲於地，即行進塲。此一點，看似無甚重要，實則全劇關鍵，皆繫於此信，盜馬後全劇之波瀾，皆起於此。愚在民國二三年間歷觀黃潤甫與楊小樓李鑫甫合演時（黃潤甫與小樓演兩次，與鑫甫演一次，）潤甫在盜馬時之表演，即逈異於尋常伶工，當彼盜得御馬至塲中時，以一手取信注視作得意狀，然後俯視地上作覓一適當之所以備投擲書信之計，此乃必不可少之描寫神情，與劇中應有畫龍點睛之筆，蓋此信而不能入於其人之目，則其費盡心力以盜馬之舉，實為多事也矣。潤甫演此時，特別精細，台下亦多凝神而觀，李連仲亦能傳潤甫之神，今如郝壽臣金少山裘盛戎輩，皆無潤甫之精彩表演矣。此豈小節，一經道破，必有以愚言為可資研究者，舊劇之衰落，不得不婦咎於名伶之組心忽略，而負敎戲之責者，於此等細微而實關重要之點，實應深長思之也。</p>
<p>裘盛戎此劇頗具工力，而亦有失之過火處，殆一意求好，這不免賣力太過耳。高盛麟之黃天覇，唱念皆師法小樓，亦有可取處，是日王福山之朱光祖，因病未露，愚於王長林逝世之後，即一王福山亦綠　一面，而是蘭與王福山，而福山終不得見，其惟俟賭異日是耳。</p>

<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Women　in　the　Wind”</p>
<p>最近膠片飛漲，各國產電影公司有建議將片子長度自一萬尺縮至七八千尺。其實這問題，是很容易解決的，一切拖泥帶水的過塲戲，導演者應該儘力避免，這些贅纍的膠片，不但沒有利益，有時反而能損害整個戲的發展的。反之，多化一二千尺膠片，求本身的精彩，也不會得不償失的。</p>
<p>「羣鶯亂飛」不是一部最優秀的作品，但是在導演者明快的處理，及簡潔的織接下，覺得七八千尺的膠片也够應付一部電影了。因之，提到上面這問題。</p>
<p>如介紹飛行家亞斯出塲，及男女主角的相遇，都非常簡省而活潑。</p>
<p>前後兩塲天空飛行，也處理得很緊凑。珍妮駕機飛翔時，亞斯急得不知所措，導演者把天空的飛行險狀，及地面上各人的危急狀態，描寫得十分可愛的。最近在珍妮的五號機危急之前，先寫十號機的失事，這加强後面的緊張空氣，也是很總明的。</p>
<p>凱茀葛茜絲的珍妮，在火油告罄，及機輪撞去一隻，不能下降的時候，幾個特寫，面部表情像平常時一樣，一點沒有焦慮的表演，而且外形（太胖）和年齡都不像一個少女。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops on Entire Northern Hubei Front Retreat Southeast Toward Sui County; Chinese Troops Recapture Important Strongholds Such as Gaocheng and Lishan; Japanese Troops Attacking Taihang Mountains in Five Routes Suffer Crushing Defeat; Chinese Air Force Continuously Bombs Japanese Ships in the Pearl River Estuary</h3>
<p>Fancheng: Japanese troops in the Yu-E Border Region attacked the northern side of the Tongbai Mountains but were repelled by Chinese troops. They changed their attack to the southern side, capturing Gaocheng and Lishan, and advanced in three routes towards Zaoyang. The mobile Chinese garrison retreated to lure the Japanese troops deeper, while simultaneously dispatching units to flank them. Troops from the area of [missing word] launched a pincer attack. After the Japanese troops attacking north of Yangzi were defeated by the Chinese crossing-river troops, they urgently coordinated with fresh troops to launch a fierce counterattack. The intruding Japanese troops, under pressure from three sides of the Chinese forces, suffered heavy losses. On the evening of the 8th, Gaocheng, Lishan, Qigumiao, Jiangjiahe, and other places were all recaptured. The entire front retreated southeast towards Sui County, and the Chinese troops are in pursuit. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Chinese Air Force has been flying continuously over the Pearl River Estuary and the Humen area to reconnoiter and bomb Japanese warships. All missions have been completed and they have safely returned to base. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Japanese warships have concentrated again near Hengmen, and the atmosphere is tense again. The Chinese army is closely monitoring the situation. (9th Special Dispatch) According to military sources, the Japanese troops who launched an attack on the Taihang Mountains in five routes had their military operations hindered by heavy rains and floods, and were also subjected to fierce attacks by large Chinese forces in multiple directions. Their dreams vanished like a fleeting cloud. They have now begun to retreat. The Japanese troops attacking Jincheng north from Bo'ai were shaken because their rear in Qinyang was surrounded by Chinese troops. They withdrew 3,000 to 4,000 of the troops harassing Jincheng towards Daoqing and Qiancun, and nearly 1,000 of them went directly to reinforce Qinyang. As for the Japanese troops attacking east along the Yi-Jin Highway from Yicheng, they had already been frightened after the battles of Dongfeng and Yangcheng. They suffered another major defeat in the battle of Qingshui. This group of Japanese troops has been cut into two by the Chinese army. Apart from a small part fleeing east to Jincheng, the majority retreated towards Yicheng and Jiangxian. In addition, the Japanese troops attacking east along the Hongtun Avenue once raided Tunliu, and then attacked Changzhi and Gaoping to the south. When the Chinese army launched an attack on Changzhi and Gaoping, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand it and retreated in defeat. Furthermore, the Japanese troops in Fushan attempted to reinforce Gaoping at the beginning of the month, but were ambushed by the Chinese army, resulting in over a thousand casualties. Five officers, including the regimental commander, Tamamitsu Tai, were killed by the Chinese army. Furthermore, the Japanese troops who went south along the Bai-Jin Highway, after raiding Changzhi and Gaoping, attempted to make contact in Jincheng. On the 22nd of last month, the Japanese forces launched a combined attack on Lingchuan from Changzhi, Gaoping, and Jincheng in three routes. The Chinese army quickly rose up to meet them, killing a large number of Japanese troops, including their battalion commander, Yamashita. The Chinese army then recaptured Changzhi. Recently, it has also been reported that Gaoping has also been recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops have already retreated north, but the Bai-Jin Highway has been thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese, so the remaining Japanese troops trapped in Jincheng, surrounded on all sides, feel even more stuck between a rock and a hard place. In addition, the Japanese troops who attacked Linxian west from Anyang originally attempted to launch another westward attack to open up communication between Henan and Shanxi, and at the same time relieve the siege of Changzhi. However, after the Chinese army captured Linxian on the 4th, and Changzhi was also recovered, the Japanese realized that their strength was exhausted and had to retreat back to Anyang. Communication between Henan and Shanxi is still blocked. Recently, the Yahe and Honghe rivers in northern Henan have all flooded. The Japanese have applied the despicable tactics they used in central Hebei to Henan, breaching dikes everywhere, trying to drown all the people in this area to vent their anger at their defeat. The flood situation in northern Henan is extremely dire. According to the current situation, the Japanese military's attempt to attack the Taihang Mountains has completely failed. The Southeast Shanxi war situation has temporarily come to an end. However, the Japanese’s decision to breach dikes to vent their anger after their defeat is worthy of our serious attention. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shashi: Chinese troops have been attacking Japanese troops near Zhongxiang for days, making rapid progress. The Japanese troops in Huangmiao, repeatedly assaulted by Chinese troops, have fled in disorder to the east, and the area has also been recovered. Another unit of the Chinese army encountered Japanese troops near Zhangjiatai on the 4th. After a fierce battle lasting several hours, more than fifty Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese troops, unable to withstand it, fled. The Chinese army took the opportunity to occupy the Zhangjiatai stronghold. The Japanese troops in Zhongxiang are now extremely panicked, and the Chinese army is in pursuit. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Converge on the Outskirts of Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to information obtained here, regular Chinese troops are currently gathering on the outskirts of Shanghai. It is said that Chinese troops are currently advancing towards Shanghai along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing railways. It is reported that the Chinese troops along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line intend to concentrate in Xujiahui, Xinlonghua, and Xinzhuang, while those on the Shanghai-Nanjing line intend to concentrate in Nanxiang, Zhenru, Huangdu, Anting, and Kunshan.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Organizes Economic Guerrillas</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Military Affairs Commission's War Zone Military and Political Affairs Committee is actively organizing "Economic Guerrillas," with the aim of overturning the economic system of the occupied areas, and attempting to spread anti-war propaganda, non-cooperation ideas, and arming the peasants among the Japanese troops. The committee is chaired by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, with Li Jishen as his deputy. The committee recently held a plenary session here, deciding to unify the management of party, government, and military affairs in the guerrilla areas. At present, four branches have been established, and it is planned to establish a branch in each war zone soon. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Consulate in Shantou Lodges Strong Protest with Japan; Mob Disturb British Overseas Chinese Property; Japan Makes Five Demands to Britain</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Regarding the anti-British incident that occurred in Shantou on Monday, as reported by the Japanese side, according to semi-official British sources, anti-British Chinese masses disturbed the property of British overseas Chinese, causing a small squad of unarmed sailors from the British destroyer HMS Thracian to land to protect them. However, the masses became more agitated when they saw them, and threw stones and other objects. In order to avoid conflict, the British sailors withdrew to the British Consulate. Afterwards, Japanese troops arrived and the masses dispersed. As a result, only one Chinese person was mistakenly injured by a compatriot. It is reported that the British Consulate in Shantou has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese Consulate. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It has recently been learned that the masses instigated by the Japanese attempted to destroy the British Consulate in Shantou this Monday. Therefore, the British warship HMS Thracian, which was docked in the port, immediately dispatched sailors to land and implement protection. According to British officials here, the British sailors landed at the request of the consul. It is reported that the Chinese masses once rushed into the gate of the British Consulate, threw stones at the consulate buildings, and shouted anti-British slogans. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news here today, after the British warship HMS Thracian sent a team to land in Shantou on Monday, the Japanese authorities in Shantou made five demands to the British side. The reason for the British warship sending troops to land was that the British Consulate in Shantou was threatened by anti-British Chinese mobs, so they sent troops to land for protection. It is reported that the demonstrators entered the grounds of the British Consulate, engaged in construction, and shouted various anti-British slogans. However, the British landing troops were all unarmed and tried their best to avoid conflict with the provocative Chinese people, taking refuge in the British Consulate. Before long, the Japanese military police also arrived at the scene to suppress the situation. After the Chinese mobs dispersed, the British soldiers returned to the ship. According to Japanese sources, yesterday the Japanese leader visited the British Consulate and made five demands: (1) The British Consulate must admit that British soldiers also participated in the riots; (2) Compensation for the injured Chinese; (3) An apology from the British side; (4) Punishment of the British naval soldiers; (5) No recurrence of similar unfortunate events in the future. According to the British side here, the facts of this unfortunate incident are not as such. The Chinese mobs did invade the British Consulate and did throw bricks and stones at the building, shouting slogans. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Pays Attention to Anti-Opium Policy</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to the three chairmen of Chengdu Wang, Kangding Liu, and Guizhou Wu, increasing their responsibilities, urging them to eliminate private opium smokers in the three provinces. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangxi Comfort Mission Arrives in Chongqing Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Li Xianhua, the acting leader of the Guangxi All Sectors Comfort Mission to the Expeditionary Soldiers, and a group of twenty people, arrived in Chongqing on the afternoon of the 9th. Within days, they will present flags to the leader and pay their respects. They will stay in Chongqing for one week, observing the construction of the new capital, and then go to Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan to provide comfort. This trip focuses on providing spiritual comfort to the expeditionary soldiers. Therefore, in addition to the comfort bags donated by all sectors, they also brought comfort letters from the families and friends of the expeditionary soldiers, recent photos of the clans, and reports on the construction of Guangxi's politics, economy, education, and culture in the past two years.

<h3>Xikang Expedites Road Construction</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing News: The road connecting Xikang to Calcutta, India, and Xining in Qinghai, as well as Kunming in Yunnan, is currently being expedited, with over 130,000 workers mobilized. The section from Dajianlu to Chengdu can be completed by next spring. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a member of the Xikang inspection group today, Xikang is indeed the richest virgin province in all of China. The most difficult problem at present is the transportation problem, but the government is actively trying to solve it. The province's roads are being built on a large scale, so Xikang's economic resources will soon be able to reach the outside world directly. The road from Chongqing to Kangding is 880 miles long and will be completed next spring. As for the roads from Kangding to Xining in Qinghai, and from Kangding to Kunming, so as to connect with Burma, they are also being surveyed. It is said that the Xikang people's contentment, happiness, and simplicity are rare in the western provinces of China. Religion has a great power over people's lives. Two-thirds of the people's income must be handed over to the temples, so the political power of the temples is becoming increasingly powerful. People's lives are very simple, and wheat flour is their main food. The people there are content if they have food and can dance in the evening. There are almost no lawsuits, because they are peaceful people. Many young people in Xikang do not like to study. Most of the students in school are representatives studying for others. The power of local chieftains is still very strong. Although county magistrates have been established in Xikang since it was changed to a province in January last year, they still obey the orders of their chieftains in every move. The way Xikang people deal with criminals is also quite straightforward. For example, if someone kills another person, the murderer does not need to pay with his life in Xikang, but all his property must be confiscated and handed over to the relatives of the victim. People's concept of wealth is also primitive. All food and other objects are wrapped in animal skins. The language of the Xikang people is in the same system as Tibetan, and their customs and religions are all the same. Although the province has only three million people, there are thousands of lamas, most of whom are graduates of Lhasa University. (8th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Reviews British and American Policies</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily published an editorial today reviewing the history of British and American policies in the Far East, and studying the rights and interests of the two countries in China, urging Britain and the United States to adopt the same policies in the Far East and take parallel actions. When the interests of either country are invaded by Japan, the other country will also be affected. At the same time, if one country protects its interests, the other country will also feel safe. The various difficulties that Britain is facing in the current environment are self-evident. The newspaper concluded by saying that in recent years, the policies of Britain and the United States towards the Far East have shown signs of divergence. The United States' announcement of the abolition of the trade treaty with Japan is an opportunity and encouragement for the two countries to take parallel actions in the Far East. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chongqing-Hong Kong Wireless Telephone to Open Scheduled Calls</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing-Hong Kong-Philippines wireless telephone has been successfully tested. Scheduled calls between Chongqing and Hong Kong will be opened on the 15th. The methods and prices will be announced soon. Preparations for the Chongqing-Philippines line have not yet been completed, and the opening of calls will be slightly delayed. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan is Assisting the Vietnamese Revolutionary Party</h3>
<p>(Xianghe) According to reliable sources, the Japanese are currently assisting the Vietnamese Revolutionary Party to resume its activities. They recently invited former Vietnamese Emperor's younger brother Nguyen Phuc Canh to Tokyo to discuss matters, and gave him 30,000 Japanese yen for travel expenses. More than ten members of the party gathered in Guangzhou last month and decided to telegraph Nguyen Phuc Canh to go to Guangzhou immediately to preside over the meeting. The party leader Tan Jianxi has gone from Haiphong to Guangzhou. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Analysis of the Relationship Between Japan, Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly discussed the issue of Japan's joining the German-Italian military alliance. In recent days, there have been no new actions or developments, but there are still some things that are worth continuing to explore.</p>
<p>Berlin and Rome have always been keen to publicize and exaggerate such matters. However, in this case, the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima, and the Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori, met in Selopio to discuss this issue. The Japanese were boasting and exaggerating, making a lot of noise, and other countries were watching closely, regarding it as a potential catalyst for a major change in the international situation. However, public opinion in Germany and Italy has remained silent from the beginning, and it remains silent in recent days. This phenomenon is very thought-provoking. It is certainly not enough to explain the truth by saying that it is an accidental abnormality. If it is said that it is silence under understanding, then how to explain the Japanese propaganda? If it is said that it is a sign of German and Italian coldness towards Japan, then according to observations in Paris, it is said that the climax of the alliance issue was initiated by Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Cabinet Secretary of Japan issued a communiqué stating: "The five-minister conference began at 1:40 p.m. and ended at 6:30 p.m. to review the European situation, but no decision was made. Therefore, the five ministers will reconsider this matter." The so-called five ministers are the only core of Japanese politics, and the important national policies are internally determined by them. The so-called review of the European situation is by no means a study from the sidelines, so there is a decision that could not be made. It is needless to say that the issue of Japan's joining the German-Italian military alliance was the theme of the five-minister conference. Given that the five ministers spent five hours discussing it without reaching a decision, it is not difficult to imagine the seriousness with which the Japanese authorities are dealing with this issue, the divergence of opinions, and the hesitation of their national policy. However, yesterday's telegram from Rome stated that the Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori, issued a statement saying, "Japan will formally join the Italian-German military alliance. After the detailed methods are discussed in the near future, it can be realized." The meaning is that the basic policy has already been decided, and it will be completed as soon as the details are supplemented, and it is expected to be in the near future. Comparing the communiqué of the Cabinet Secretary with the statement of Ambassador Shiratori, does it not make people feel like they are lost in a fog?</p>
<p>Based on the above, it is still difficult for us to quickly obtain the actual situation of this issue at this stage. However, further investigation into other aspects reveals that the initial crux of this issue lies in two points: (1) The scope of application of the military alliance. Germany and Italy advocate a broad scope, that is, when any one of the three countries needs military action against any party, the allied countries must immediately and automatically fulfill their alliance obligations. Japan, on the other hand, advocates dividing it into two parts, that is, when military action is needed against the Soviet Union, the allied countries immediately and automatically fulfill their alliance obligations, but for countries other than the Soviet Union, Japan in principle agrees to military cooperation, but whether or not to invoke the alliance must be decided separately after mutual consultation depending on the time and circumstances. (2) The method of the military alliance. Germany and Italy advocate openness, while Japan advocates keeping it secret. These two points cannot be regarded as a difference in the degree of each other's attitude, because their essence is absolutely not the same. From the first point of view, what Germany and Italy need from Japan is by no means to deal with the Soviet Union. If it is only to deal with the Soviet Union, then the alliance becomes a useless object. If Japan is required to jointly deal with other countries, but Japan only promises a vague principle, then given Japan's many concerns about other countries, how could it decide to invoke the alliance during the "mutual consultation and separate decision"? If it does not invoke it, then the so-called agreement in principle is equivalent to a mere formality. From the second point of view, what Japan fears is that the openness of the military alliance will create enemies everywhere and put itself in a desperate situation. What Germany and Italy seek is to use the openness of the military alliance to the full extent of its power to threaten and lure in Europe, and to settle things without a war. That is, what Germany and Italy expect is to use the alliance to gain the submission and appeasement of Britain and France, while what Japan is worried about is that the alliance will make Britain and France acutely opposed to Japan. This is the initial crux.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation has changed dramatically. Although the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has not yet been concluded, the staff meeting has already been launched. The private wish of Germany and Italy to alienate Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in exchange for the Soviet Union to remain neutral has been dashed. In addition, after repeated concessions to the Soviet Union, the political and military agreements between the three countries are all coming to fruition, and as a result, their momentum has greatly increased. Moreover, the relationship between the United States and Britain and France is gradually reaching perfection without any trace, which is also beneficial to Britain and France and not to Germany and Italy. This dramatic change makes it inappropriate for Germany and Italy to adopt the consistent style of the past in their future actions, and what they need from Japan is also not as urgent as it was in the past. At the same time, the military conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union in China and Manchuria must be regarded by Germany and Italy as unnecessary and inevitably containing a crisis. What will Germany and Italy do to fulfill this unnecessary and dangerous alliance obligation on the day the three-nation military alliance is established? Not only that, but the United States is becoming increasingly stern towards Japan, and Britain is becoming increasingly tough towards Japan. Germany and Italy are seeking to restrain their past style, while Japan's deterioration and acuteness towards Britain and the United States is gradually reaching a point where it is difficult to reverse. This dramatic change makes Germany and Italy wary of Japan's actions, while Japan's expectations for Germany and Italy's response have become more eager. Even so, it is not to say that there is a vast gulf between Germany and Italy and Japan. The original three-nation military alliance originally originated from Germany and Italy, and Germany and Italy naturally control the key to the operation of the alliance. Therefore, what Japan is worried about is only becoming a tool of Germany and Italy. Now, with the deterioration of Japan's international environment reaching its peak, Germany and Italy are worried that even if the key is not entirely tied to Japan, they are at least worried that Japan will encounter international headwinds and make Germany and Italy unable to control their key alone. If Germany and Italy and Japan cannot find a satisfactory solution in the meantime, then the so-called military alliance will inevitably be stuck in the stage of "waiting for the detailed methods to be discussed" for a long time!</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement Intensifies; Japanese Troops in Xuzhou Arrest Canadians; Taoyuan Churchgoers Kidnapped with Japanese Driving Cars; Beijing Offers Reward for Anti-British Songs; Henan Demands Return of Fufeng Company Coal Mine</h3>
<p>(Beijing) The anti-British movement in North China is spreading more and more. Two Canadians and four Chinese in Xuzhou have been arrested by the local Japanese garrison authorities. According to semi-official Japanese sources, this is another case of British spies. It is said that the Canadians organized an anti-Japanese national salvation association in the church they managed, and that they provided the Chongqing government with news of Japanese military actions. All the Chinese employees employed by the British travel agency in Beijing have resigned because one of them was detained by the Japanese, fearing that the Japanese would take unfavorable actions against them. It is rumored that the Chinese servants employed by the British will all resign around August 15.

<p>(London) Regarding the matter of the "official office" under the control of the Japanese in Henan Province, China, intending to confiscate the British Fufeng Company's Bai Mei Mine, the government has instructed Sir Craigie, the ambassador to Japan, to lodge a protest with the Japanese government. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Woodrow, the general manager of the British Fufeng Company, said today that the Henan Provincial Government under the protection of the Japanese has indeed demanded the return of the Fufeng Company's coal mine. He believes that this is the first attempt to seize British property in China. He has petitioned the British Foreign Office to quickly negotiate with Tokyo on this matter, and to inform the French and Belgian directors of the Fufeng Company to ask their governments to pay attention.

<p>(London) The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has been instructed to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese government regarding the confiscation of British coal mines in Henan Province.

<p>(Beijing) According to a telegram from Qingdao, the large-scale anti-British demonstration originally scheduled to be held there today has been postponed for a week. Certain people here believe that the sudden change of the original plan by the local anti-British committee may be related to the arrival of the British cruiser HMS Kent in Qingdao. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Chamber of Commerce here has recently received a report from the British Chamber of Commerce in Qingdao, stating that the Chinese people who participated in the anti-British demonstration in Qingdao on July 23 were either forced or subsidized. For example, Chinese officials of the Sanitation Bureau, under the protection of the Japanese army, posted anti-British slogans on the walls of the British Consulate General, various British commercial houses, and public places. Many Japanese people expressed opposition to this. It can be clearly seen from the fact that several large Japanese commercial houses did not allow demonstrators to post slogans in their commercial houses. The general public believes that the anti-British movement was launched by the local Japanese army authorities. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the anti-British movement in Tianjin and other places in North China, political figures here regard it as a major threat to British interests in the Far East. It is reported that the British government has now instructed the British Consul General in Tianjin to lodge another protest with the Japanese military authorities, demanding that the Japanese military protect British shops and companies outside the British Concession in Tianjin. Since receiving the detailed report of the Qingdao British Chamber of Commerce on the boycott of British goods movement, the British have become more concerned about the evolution of the situation in the Far East.

<h3>Highway Transportation Administration Formally Established</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, highway transportation has become increasingly frequent. In order to improve efficiency and meet the needs, the Ministry of Communications has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to separate the highway transportation business from the engineering management. The method is to separate the transportation business of the various highway bureaus directly under the Ministry of Communications and establish a highway transportation bureau to handle it, and another highway transportation administration is established to lead it. The engineering improvement and traffic management are still promoted separately by the Highway Management Office of the Ministry of Communications. Now the Highway Transportation Administration has been formally established on August 1, and various highway agencies have been re-adjusted, with the following results: (1) The original Southwest Highway Transportation Administration has been abolished. (2) The Southwest Highway Management Office has been established to handle the engineering management of the highways from Chongqing via Guiyang to Liuzhou, and from Changsha via Guiyang to Kunming. (3) The Sichuan-Guizhou Highway Transportation Bureau has been established to manage the transportation business of the Chongqing-Guiyang-Liuzhou-Changsha line. (4) The Sichuan-Yunnan Highway Management Office has been established to handle the engineering management of the Kunming-Luzhou line, and also兼 the transportation business of the line. The Northwest Highway Agency is being adjusted. (9th)</p>
<h3>American Consul General in Hankou Goes to Jiujiang to Inspect Overseas Chinese Affairs</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The American Vice Consul in Hankou, Davis, took a Japanese ship to Jiujiang today in order to inspect the situation of American overseas Chinese in Jiujiang, Guling, and Nanchang. In June of this year, according to Japanese sources, many anti-Japanese leaflets and pamphlets were found in the home of American missionary Holen in Nanchang. Since then, Holen has disappeared, so the American side has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, requesting that it be facilitated to go and find out the truth. In addition to Holen, it is said that the situation of three American female missionaries in a church hospital in Nanchang is also unclear. (9th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Regarding Restrictions on the British Concession in Tianjin: Japanese Side Claims Intensification; Dissatisfaction Expressed with Negotiations in Tokyo; Demands for Resolution of Economic and Police Affairs</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) British architect Anderssen, who has resided in China for a long time, at 12:20 PM today, when passing through the barricade at the Shanxi Road intersection, was ordered by Japanese soldiers to take off his clothes. However, after Anderssen argued with the Japanese soldiers, he was not made to take off his clothes and was released. This is an unprecedented instance since the blockade of the Tianjin concession. However, according to a Japanese military spokesperson today, the Japanese side will intensify restrictions on the British concession due to extreme dissatisfaction with the British side's delaying tactics in the Tokyo talks. Unless the British side shows sufficient sincerity in resolving both economic and police issues simultaneously, the Japanese side will intensify its blockade of the British concession. "We are not afraid of the British's waiting policy; what we demand is a straightforward 'yes' or 'no' answer," they said. They also stated that the British government is constantly concerned about the humiliation suffered by British nationals in Tianjin, but if Britain does not resolve the Tokyo talks within the next few days, it will face even more severe blockades. They added that the Japanese side is well aware that the British current policy is entirely aimed at prolonging the situation in order to establish a British-Soviet military alliance and to seek the opinions of Washington and Chongqing.

<p>(Tianjin) Beef, which had been cut off for nearly a week, reappeared today, but within the concession, it sells for 60 cents a pound, while outside the concession, it only sells for 40 cents a pound. It is heard from butchers that this beef has to pay a passage fee when passing through the entrance to the concession, hence the higher price. As for the reason for the reappearance of this beef, according to Yong Bao, it is the result of a compromise reached between the slaughterhouse and the farmers. (AP dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Mrs. Anderssen, the wife of a British national, accompanied by her friend, Mrs. Warhara, went to the Special District No. 1 this morning on important business. When leaving the British concession, there were no difficulties. However, when they attempted to return to the British concession through the Shanxi Road entrance after finishing their business, they were stopped and told that they had to re-enter the British concession through the Zhongjie entrance they had used when entering the Special District No. 1. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at that location, they were still not allowed to pass. Mrs. Anderssen then telephoned her husband, and Mr. Anderssen drove to the Shanxi Road entrance to pick up his wife and friend, showing his passport. The guards there told him that he must undergo a strip search. Mr. Anderssen firmly refused, saying that he only had glasses and miscellaneous items in his pockets and that he was not hiding anything else and that they could search him. After arguing for about five minutes, they finally allowed him to pass. Anderssen is a well-known architect in Tianjin and has resided in China for quite some time. Mrs. Warhara is the wife of the director of a foreign company, Gaolin. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>China Sells Large Quantity of Silver to the United States; Worth Two Million US Dollars; Silver Sale Agreement Established One Month Ago; Used to Maintain Legal Tender and Purchase Military Supplies</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is heard that the US Treasury has decided to purchase 6 million ounces of silver from the Chinese government at the prevailing foreign silver price upon delivery. It is generally believed that this silver is already en route. This silver purchase agreement was established about a month ago. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Express recently commented on the US Treasury's agreement to purchase 6 million ounces of silver from China, stating, "The United States' purchase of silver from China, worth more than two million US dollars, is a direct act of assistance to China, because the United States' interests in the Far East are already under threat. The US government is fully aware of this and has taken proactive measures to make Japan aware of the US's attitude. This should also be seen as support for Britain in its negotiations with Japan, and if the negotiations break down, it should take consistent action with the United States to protect common interests." (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) An Associated Press reporter learned today that China will use the revenue from selling 6 million ounces of silver to the US government to maintain legal tender or purchase US military supplies. The negotiations between the US Treasury and China to purchase 6 million ounces of Chinese silver for two million US dollars were completed in mid-July, but US Treasury officials still refused to discuss the contents of the agreement. These types of transactions are said to be kept "secret." The silver shipped from China to the United States is made by melting silver dollars. The transportation of silver is extremely secretive. The location where the silver is shipped from and the location where it is unloaded in the United States are unknown, as the Chinese government deeply fears that revealing the details will endanger the transportation. (AP dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Official sources here have confirmed the news of the US Treasury purchasing 6 million ounces of Chinese silver. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The claim in the Daily Herald that the Soviet government has agreed to lend 700 million rubles to China is not believed by Chinese circles in London. They believe that this claim originated from the commercial agreement signed between China and the Soviet Union in May of this year. It is generally believed that the agreement must stipulate that the Soviet Union will grant China a certain amount of credit, but the amount is unknown. The News Chronicle strongly argues that the US Treasury's purchase of 6 million ounces of Chinese silver has significant political implications and that its importance is equivalent to the US government's abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty.

<h3>No Possibility of US-Japan Concluding New Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the newly appointed State Department official, Grady, speaking to reporters today, he believes that there is no possibility of the United States concluding a new commercial treaty with dictatorial countries such as Germany and Japan. The US government is at least not opposed to concluding new treaties under certain conditions, but because the systems promoted by dictatorial countries are fundamentally contradictory to our interests, there is absolutely no possibility of concluding new agreements. (AP dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding reports in Japanese newspapers stating that Japan intends to begin negotiations for a new commercial treaty with the United States, this has not been confirmed as of yet. Yesterday, in an intelligence meeting, reporters questioned Assistant Secretary of State Welles about this issue. According to his response, neither the Japanese ambassador to the United States nor the US chargé d'affaires in Japan have reported on this matter, so Washington is unaware of it.

<h3>US Treasury Secretary's European Trip: Anglo-Franco-American Monetary Agreement to Undergo Significant Revision</h3>
<p>(London) US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is currently touring Denmark. Although it is said that this trip is purely of a personal nature, financial circles in both Britain and the United States believe that he will take the opportunity to hold talks with the financial authorities of Britain and France, hoping to make significant revisions to the Anglo-Franco-American Monetary Agreement, as the situation has changed since the agreement was established in 1936. For example, the French economy has improved, and the position of the French franc has been restored, which is one reason. The European situation is tense, and British gold is fleeing to the United States, which is another reason. Therefore, for the benefit of the three signatory countries, it is necessary to make adjustments. It is expected that the revision of the monetary agreement will not be based on complete mutual spirit between the three countries, but that the United States will grant credit to Britain and France. Regarding this, the British Exchange Equalisation Account still holds a huge amount of gold, valued at 350 million pounds. If its strength is further enhanced in the future, so that temporary measures will not be taken to harm the British currency market in the event of an emergency, this would be wise. In addition, former Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland is scheduled to come to London within days to meet with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, and financial circles here are also paying close attention to this.

<h3>Economic Issues Difficult to Compromise: Anglo-Japanese Negotiations at a Standstill; Japanese Side Insists on Resolving Economic and Police Issues Simultaneously</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese conference is being delayed because the British government is consulting with third-party powers, and the Japanese government is showing signs of impatience. The leader of the Japanese delegation, Kato, has sent a message to British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie, questioning the long delay in the arrival of new instructions from the British government, stating that Britain and Japan can resolve the disputes over police and economic affairs. The official also reiterated that the Japanese government opposes interference from third parties. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In the afternoon of the 8th, British Ambassador Craigie, who had returned to Tokyo from Hakone, invited Major General Pigott, Consul Halford, and various secretaries to the embassy to discuss the central issue of the instructions from their home government. However, the instructions that have arrived successively since the evening of the 7th are only the final views of the British side on the security issue, on which the representatives of the two countries have already reached an agreement. As for the important instructions regarding the economic issues that are currently being negotiated, they have not arrived at all. Therefore, Ambassador Craigie met with Minister Kato at the Tokyo Club at 5:00 PM on the 8th, stating that although half of the instructions from the British government regarding the Tianjin local issue have arrived, they mainly concern security and police issues, while the instructions regarding economic issues have not been received at all. Therefore, given the current situation, if the seventh conference were to be held, it would only be possible to discuss and resolve the security issue first, and there would be no other way. As for the economic issues, the home government is currently consulting with third countries, and it is uncertain when those third countries will accept the home government's views. Therefore, if Japan intends to discuss both the security issue and the economic issues at the next meeting, it is difficult to determine when the next meeting can be notified. Of course, the British side has no intention of deliberately delaying the situation and sincerely hopes to advance the conference. He hoped that the Japanese side would understand this. Minister Kato replied that it was regrettable that the British home government was delaying the conference due to its relationship with third countries. As for the delay in the situation, the Japanese government also has its own opinions to express and does not intend to respond specifically. The meeting then ended, and Minister Kato went to the Foreign Ministry. (Domei dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Possibility of Negotiations Breaking Down</h3>
<p>(London) A financial news political reporter stated that the date for the resumption of the Tokyo talks has not yet been determined, and there may even be a possibility that they will never resume. There is currently reason to believe that the British government will consider a compromise solution to the issue of Chinese currency and silver reserves, based on handing over the silver reserves to the Japanese while continuing to support Chinese legal tender. However, political observers yesterday were highly doubtful that the Japanese side would be willing to accept a solution that only satisfies part of its demands. If the British attitude remains firm in the future, the prediction that the negotiations will break down may eventually be realized. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed observers here believe that there is no basis for the claim in the Financial News that Britain is currently seeking a compromise solution to the issue of Chinese currency and silver. According to them, this compromise solution, in which Britain hands over the Chinese silver reserves in the British concession in Tianjin while continuing to support Chinese legal tender, has been discussed but abandoned due to opposition from the most powerful official opinions. Observers emphasized that the most important issue for Japan today is to gain recognition of the puppet currency by the powers. We believe that Japan's various attempts to obtain foreign currency will fail. They also believe that the devaluation of Chinese legal tender is a deliberate move by the National Government to implement a "scorched earth policy" on foreign exchange in order to resist Japan's new economic warfare against China.

<h3>British Foreign Office Drafts New Instructions</h3>
<p>(London) According to news from here last night, the British Foreign Office has drafted new instructions to British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie. The new instructions include Britain's attitude towards Japan's demands regarding the currency system and silver issues in North China. British officials said that the new instructions still need to be briefly discussed before they can be telegraphed to Tokyo. (AP dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Concede on Security Issues</h3>
<p>(London) It is claimed that today Britain intends to extradite four Chinese terrorist suspects detained in the British concession in Tianjin, partially or entirely, to the Japanese military authorities. (The British authorities initially refused to extradite these suspects, which was the main reason for the Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin.) Britain is also prepared to compromise on Japan's demand to participate in maintaining order in the British concession. (London dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>British Press Comments on Currency Issues</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Star Evening News recently published an editorial on the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo, paying close attention to the issue of British aid to Chinese legal tender, stating that if Britain ceases to aid legal tender, the commercial interests of all countries in China will be harmed, including the United States. Therefore, the most important issue being discussed in Tokyo is this one. Japan intends to force Britain to recognize the new currency issued by the Japanese. "This is part of Japan's overall plan, which is to drive the interests of all countries out of China, or at least place them completely under Japanese control. Chinese legal tender is a sound currency; conversely, the so-called new currency is difficult to trust due to Japanese management of exchange rates and arbitrary manipulation. If Britain ceases to aid legal tender, its first impact will be to allow a currency of questionable nature to replace a sound currency, and Japan's attempt to exclude the interests of all countries in China will gain progress. Commercial interests of all countries will henceforth be completely subject to Japan." (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Tianjin Indignant Towards Britain</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The local Japanese military authorities are greatly dissatisfied with the British side's deliberate delay of the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. At 12:30 PM on the 9th, they issued a statement as follows: "The British authorities have consistently adopted a fence-sitting policy, equivocating between Tokyo and Chongqing, and engaging in double-dealing. This can be clearly seen from the course of events up to today, based on the principles agreed upon. Moreover, regarding the issue of legal tender and silver, the British side has wasted more than ten days and has not yet telegraphed back its instructions, deliberately obstructing the progress of the Tokyo negotiations. However, regarding this issue, the US Secretary of State has stated his intention to take an independent stance, and France has also expressed its intention to follow the British policy. Therefore, the British side's claim of consulting with relevant countries is no longer an issue. Now, the British side is using consultations with the United States and France as an excuse to try to prolong the resolution of this issue as much as possible. There is no doubt that this is a delaying tactic on its fence-sitting policy. The British side's intention is nothing more than to implement its initial claim of 'separating economic issues from security and police issues' so that during this period, it can hurry to conclude a British-French-Soviet defensive alliance with France and the Soviet Union, and, if possible, try to resolve the crisis in the European situation, especially the Danzig issue, while observing the attitudes of the United States and Chongqing, and then gradually deal with the Far Eastern issue. However, the Japanese are not so easily deceived and have patience. If the British side consistently expresses its insincere attitude, then there is no need to ask meaningless trivial questions, but simply say 'yes' or 'no' straightforwardly. The local Japanese military authorities are carefully applying technical measures to the blockade of the concession amid the ups and downs of the Tokyo negotiations. If the British side shows no sincere attitude, then even if Prime Minister Chamberlain's so-called 'intolerable insults' are repeated, it is the British side that is to blame and should not be criticized by the Japanese side. We are currently quietly waiting for the British side to answer 'yes' or 'no'." (Domei dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japan Negotiating Military Alliance with Germany and Italy; German Side Accommodating Japanese Views; Issue of Joining Alliance Gradually Taking Concrete Shape</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign dispatches, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Hiroshi Oshima and Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori met on the shores of Lake Como in Italy on the 4th of this month to discuss the issue of Japan joining the German-Italian alliance. According to well-informed sources, the issue of Japan's joining has made great progress. In the first half of June, the Japanese government submitted a counterproposal to the suggestions of Germany and Italy, with the content divided into three items: (1) Japan is willing to conclude an unconditional and automatic military alliance to deal with the Soviet Union. (2) For other enemy countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact's triangular group, Japan agrees in principle to accept mutual assistance constraints, but the implementation method will be mutually consulted and decided when various emergencies occur. (3) This alliance must not be publicized to avoid agitating British and American public opinion. The German and Italian authorities, especially Hitler and those around him, were dissatisfied with the above points and rejected them. Ambassadors Oshima and Shiratori then reopened negotiations and agreed on compromise methods for the second and third points. Regarding the third point, Japan accepted the German view that the publication of the alliance had both advantages and disadvantages and could be done. However, regarding the second point, Japan had many concerns about confronting the Soviet Union and Britain after accepting the European policies of Germany and Italy, and the two sides consulted for a long time without reaching an agreement. Germany, in view of the evolution of the international situation in the past two months, also agreed to accommodate Japan's views. However, there was infighting between young Japanese military officers and moderates. Recently, the Anglo-Japanese talks, the moderates tended towards Britain, which caused the military alliance proposal to be hit. The moderates had to actively act and forced the Japanese government to take action, and at the same time, to test the intentions of various countries. (Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Japanese Ambassador to Rome Toshio Shiratori, speaking alone to an Associated Press reporter yesterday, stated that Japan's formal joining of the Italian-German military alliance could be realized after the detailed methods were negotiated in the near future. He said, "Japan's joining the military alliance of the Axis countries is not related to the US government's abolition of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty, the Tianjin situation, or the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo." Shiratori continued, "Japan's decision to join the German-Italian military alliance is not linked to the conclusion of a military alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, as Japan had already decided to participate before all these things happened." He had met with Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima in Cernobbio in the morning to discuss the revision of the proposed agreement. "The agreement will soon be signed." According to the initial public declaration of Japan's decision to join the military alliance of the Axis countries, it was issued by Ambassadors Shiratori and Oshima in Cernobbio. Later, news from Tokyo stated that the Japanese government was considering joining the military alliance of the Axis countries, and the final decision had not yet been made. Shiratori continued, "American friends in Japan have expressed concern about Japan having to conclude a treaty that the American people hate, but Japan has no choice and has no choice but to do so." He believes that Japan has abandoned its plan to join the Italian-German military alliance, and according to instructions, "the signing of the treaty must go through a long period of negotiation before it can become a reality." All parties are working hard to make the terms of the agreement satisfactory to all three countries. "After my conversation with General Oshima in Cernobbio, I spoke to Italian journalists with a light touch. I did not intend to leak diplomatic secrets about my decision with General Oshima, because the fact is that every Japanese had already understood. I was surprised to see the news published in the United States, because the military alliance is the path that our country (Japan) should take. In fact, the principle of the military alliance was decided months ago, and only the details need to be sorted out." He did not mention when and where the military alliance would be formally signed. He said that the announcement of the final decision on this issue would be issued in Tokyo. He deeply believed that the United States would appreciate the nature of "Japan's noble goals in China" in the future. (Special dispatch from Associated Press correspondent Igenes, 9th)</p>
<h3>Churchill Encourages Chinese Resistance</h3>
<p>(London) Former British Navy Minister Churchill said in a broadcast to the United States today that the sound of Japanese bombs falling on Chinese cities and universities or exploding near British and American ships has provoked condemnation not only throughout Europe but also throughout the world. The Chinese seem to be fighting very hard, and wise judges believe that the Chinese are about to win. Let us wish the Chinese happiness. Let us give the Chinese encouragement, as US President did last week when announcing the abolition of the treaty. (AP dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Exercises to be Conducted by British Army, Navy, and Air Force; Simulated Battle Held in London Skies Yesterday; Thousands of Aircraft and Tens of Thousands of Personnel Participating; Naval Reserve Force to be Inspected by the King</h3>
<p>(London) The British Army, Navy, and Air Force will successively conduct large-scale exercises starting today. Afterward, all officers and soldiers of the three forces will continue their duties until the end of September. The participants in the exercises include 118,000 Air Force personnel, the entire fleet of the main Navy force and a large part of the reserve fleet, and 750,000 Army personnel. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Air Force will begin its exercises from 8:00 PM tonight. In addition to 1,300 aircraft, there will also be ten barrage balloon squadrons and 20,000 air defense team members participating. The objective of the exercises is to protect the 26 southeastern counties, especially the densely populated areas of industrial and commercial centers, from air raids. The "attacking" aircraft will first head to Beauvais in northern France to practice night flying, then return to England, and carry out eleven air raids within forty minutes. However, according to a public statement issued by the Air Ministry, the air defense listening equipment is extremely sophisticated, so the "attacking" aircraft will have nowhere to hide. From tomorrow onwards, the "attacking" force will carry out continuous air raids day and night to test the efficiency of the anti-aircraft artillery units and the "defending" fighter planes and barrage balloons. From midnight tomorrow to 4:00 AM on the 10th, the 26 southeastern counties, including the London city area, will implement a blackout, creating a world of darkness.</p>
<p>(2) The naval exercises are scheduled to begin tomorrow. At that time, 133 warships belonging to the reserve fleet will be inspected by King George VI, accompanied by French Naval Chief of Staff Admiral Darlan, in the waters of Weymouth Harbour. Afterward, half of this fleet will join the entire main fleet to begin exercises. Participants include six battleships, several aircraft carriers, twenty-four cruisers, sixty-five destroyers, and several submarines and auxiliary ships. The theme of the exercises is being kept strictly secret by the authorities and cannot be ascertained.</p>
<p>(3) The Army is also scheduled to conduct exercises from September 10th to the 21st, simulating wartime conditions from the coast of Hampshire in the south to Yorkshire in the north. The theme is to test the Army's ability to rapidly transfer troops from the rear to the front via roads and railways to reinforce troops that have already engaged in battle. (Havas Radio, August 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Britain conducted its most intense simulated air battle last night. 1,300 of the world's fastest and most effective bombers were dispatched at 8:00 PM last night and will engage in combat day and night over half of the skies of England in the coming days, until the exercises conclude at 7:00 PM on Friday. From midnight tonight until 4:00 AM on Thursday, the exercises will be at their most intense. Twenty-eight counties in southern England will implement a blackout, and aircraft will concentrate their attacks on many targets in the area. 200,000 volunteers, as well as Air Force soldiers, Home Guard soldiers, and 7,000 members of the surveillance teams, will participate in ground exercises organized by local authorities in the area. In addition, all transportation agencies, factory owners, and civilians, including thousands of vacationers, will cooperate to complete the blackout. A highlight of the exercises will be 500 bombers taking off from airfields in England, crossing the English Channel to the French coast, and then returning to targets in England, where they will be intercepted by 800 fighter planes. Anti-aircraft guns and hundreds of searchlights have been set up at the war stations, and a hundred balloons have been raised in the London area. Although the entire barrage balloon squadron will participate, each team will only raise a few balloons in rotation. (Reuters, August 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the air defense exercises, the Air Ministry issued a public statement this morning stating that, "The air defense exercises began last night and continued until 1:00 AM today. The air force of 'Eastern Country' (i.e., the hypothetical enemy aircraft) launched a large-scale attack on 'Western Country' (the defending side), no fewer than 160 times. The 'enemy' aircraft successively concentrated their bombing on targets in the Thames Estuary, Surrey, Kent, Essex, and certain areas in southern London. However, the skies over the British mainland were cloudy last night, and there was continuous rain within a forty-mile radius around Sheffield and Brighton, making air defense work very difficult. As for the 'enemy' aircraft's attack, about 100 attackers were counted in the south, and the defending side initially dispatched more than 60 fighter planes to intercept them. Some of the 'enemy' aircraft were intercepted midway and failed to penetrate. Subsequently, several bombers were dispatched to counterattack throughout the night. Although the cloud cover was low, the reconnaissance teams were still able to work smoothly. Many barrage balloons prepared by the air defense auxiliary teams were also raised high into the air, and no accidents occurred. In addition, the 'enemy' aircraft carried out air raids at an altitude of 9,000 feet, and the anti-aircraft artillery units of the air defense team fired fiercely. When the 'enemy' attacked Portsmouth Harbour, the enemy's air raid proved to be a complete failure due to the intense fire of the anti-aircraft artillery units and the interception of many fighter planes. Until dawn, more than 60 'nimble' aircraft turned and attacked the northern districts. The Air Ministry has not yet received reports on the results." (Havas Radio, August 9th) The King traveled overnight from Scotland by special train, and today inspected the largest gathering of the British reserve fleet since the European War at Weymouth Bay. From large warships such as the flagship "Iron Duke," on which Admiral Jellicoe, the naval commander in the Battle of Jutland, served, to the latest small motor torpedo boats, a total of 133 warships were arranged in fourteen long rows, moored in the giant bay. Since the King passed through the town three weeks ago on his way to Dartmouth, the temporary residents in the town have more than doubled. In addition to 30,000 vacationers, another 50,000 people arrived by road and rail in the morning. Among those who arrived the previous evening, many could not find accommodation and stayed in beach huts and cottages. The 12,000 officers and soldiers of the reserve fleet were busy making arrangements early in the morning. At 8:00 AM, flags and banners were hung on each ship to await the arrival of the King. The ships were divided into rows, and the military appearance was solemn and awe-inspiring. Several hours before the King arrived, the roads that the royal procession would pass were already crowded with people. Soon, the King arrived at the seaside by car from the station, and the cheers were thunderous wherever the car passed. First Lord of the Admiralty Earl Stanhope and Naval Aide-de-Camp to the King Rear-Admiral Sir Rothes were waiting on the beach to welcome the King to board the royal yacht. At that time, the major warships fired a 21-gun salute. The King then began the inspection, first inspecting the 1,500 reserve soldiers on the aircraft carrier "Courageous," and then successively inspecting the other ships. The royal yacht traveled fourteen miles to complete the inspection. The sun was shining brightly in the morning, but the weather deteriorated later, and visibility was poor. (Reuters, August 9th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Franco-Soviet Military Negotiations to be Held Soon; Soviet Union Denies Inviting Poland to Participate</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Staff members of the British, French, and Soviet armies will conduct talks here within days. The British and French military delegations are scheduled to arrive in Leningrad at 1:00 AM on the 10th. British Embassy Military Attaché Colonel Firebrace and French Embassy Military Attaché General Palasse have already gone to Leningrad to greet them and will then come here together by car. They are expected to arrive here before noon on the 11th, at which time Soviet Army Chief of Staff General Shaposhnikov and representatives of the military delegation will welcome them at the station. (Havas Agency, August 8th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union has specially appointed the following personnel as Soviet representatives to conduct military negotiations with the British and French delegations: Chief Representative Marshal Voroshilov, People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union; Representatives General Shaposhnikov, Chief of the General Staff of the Army; Admiral Kuznetsov, People's Commissar of the Navy of the Soviet Union; Lieutenant General Rodionov, Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force; and Commander Smorodinov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff.

<p>(Moscow) Rumors that the Soviet government has invited Poland to participate in the talks between British, French, and Soviet staff members have been denied by responsible authorities. (Havas Agency, August 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Rumors that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov had asked Polish Ambassador Grzybowski to invite a Polish military delegation to Moscow to participate in the talks between British, French, and Soviet staff members have been denied by the governments of the Soviet Union and Poland, but rumors continue to spread. Poles here claim that Poland has not established a political agreement with the Soviet Union and is therefore not in a position to participate in military talks. However, the military attaché of the Polish Embassy in the Soviet Union may be able to assist in communication between the Polish government and the British and French military delegations, which would, in effect, be equivalent to participating in the talks between the staff members of the three countries. The main purpose of these talks is to ensure the security of countries bordering Germany through the cooperation of the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is important to the British that Poland and Romania participate in the talks. Regarding this matter, Polish Ambassador to the UK Raczynski is scheduled to return to London with precise instructions from his government at the end of this week. At the same time, Romanian Minister to the UK Tilea is also scheduled to return to his country tomorrow to report on this matter. (Havas Agency, August 8th)</p>

<h3>Progress in German-Soviet Trade Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Political figures here claim that a new German-Soviet trade agreement is expected to be signed in the next few days. It is said that German-Soviet trade negotiations have now entered a favorable stage, but officials are still maintaining a silent attitude on this matter, and newspapers have not mentioned it at all. Regarding the news from Japan that Japan intends to conclude a military alliance with the Axis powers, newspapers here have also not mentioned it. (Haitong Telegram, August 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The "Daily Mail" claims that after the establishment of a British-Soviet military alliance, the two countries will sign a new trade agreement allowing the Soviet Union a credit loan of £10 million from England to maintain trade balance. (Reuters, August 9th)</p>
<h3>German Mechanized Units Conduct Exercises</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The first phase of the German mechanized units' exercise, which is said to be extremely large-scale and unprecedented, began today. The exercise started near Risa, twenty miles northwest of Dresden, with a river crossing exercise. Engineering teams and advance teams cooperated to build a pontoon bridge on the Elbe River. In the next few weeks, there will be large-scale exercises in the northeast of the area. Many schools in Berlin are preparing to provide their school buildings for the use of passing troops. The content of the exercise is still being kept highly secret. Although British officers are also formally participating in the review of the exercise, the detailed arrangements have not yet been made public. Civilian vehicles have been requisitioned, mostly limited to trucks and motor bicycles, but private cars will likely also be requisitioned soon. The gasoline supply has not improved. Although Berlin can obtain a sufficient supply, the supply in the provinces is extremely scarce. Gas stations have been ordered to store between 550 and 300 gallons of gasoline for military use. In order to comply with the order, gas stations are unable to fully supply the needs of private individuals. (Reuters, August 8th)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Suffers from Heart Disease, Complicated by Stomach Cancer</h3>
<p>(London) According to private sources here, Mussolini is currently suffering from severe heart disease complicated by stomach cancer. Mr. Mussolini has now gone from Bologna to Rome for medical treatment. In the past, Mussolini would wait for the completion of the Italian military exercises before leaving, but he recently left an exercise before it ended. However, most people believe that Mr. Mussolini is in good health and may recover soon. This news was transmitted from sources close to Mr. Mussolini. (Associated Press, August 9th)</p>

<h3>Poland is Not Isolated; Germany Would Not Risk War; Forster Visits Hitler and Immediately Returns to Danzig; Negotiations on Polish Customs Officials to Begin Shortly</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German newspapers have been vehemently attacking Poland in recent days. In addition, Danzig Nazi leader Forster has come to Germany to pay homage to Führer Hitler. In view of this, some quarters are deeply concerned that Germany may take action against Danzig at any moment. However, most people in political circles do not believe this and say that Poland is not isolated, as Germany is aware. Therefore, unless Germany is determined to cause a general war, it will generally not take any action against Poland. It is the consensus that Germany is not in a position to risk a major war at this time. It is suspected that the reason why the newspapers are attacking Poland is to test the opinions of various countries and to induce Poland to take rash action so that the peace front can be broken. In reality, this is not a sign that something will happen to Poland immediately. Considering that the Danzig authorities finally yielded to Poland on the customs issue, this is not without evidence. On the other hand, Germany is continuing its military preparations. All kerosene merchants have been ordered to store 15,000 to 25,000 liters of kerosene to supply the military during the army's autumn exercises. All retail sales must be temporarily suspended. In addition, several schools in Berlin will vacate their buildings at the end of this week for use as accommodation for army troops participating in the exercises. (Havas Telegram, August 8th)</p>
<p>Danzig Residents of Danzig will gather in a public square tomorrow evening to hold a mass meeting to protest Poland's threat to Danzig. Danzig Nazi leader Forster returned here today from Berchtesgaden and will deliver a speech to the mass meeting tomorrow night. (Haitong Telegram, August 9th)</p>
<p>Danzig The tense situation here has now eased slightly. It is generally believed that Danzig Senate President Greiser will meet with Polish Commissioner-General Chodacki on Thursday to find a possibility to begin discussions on the status of Polish customs inspectors in the Free City. Nazi newspapers today protested vehemently because a Polish newspaper carried a report that if the Danzig authorities imposed a fait accompli on Poland, Poland would have to shoot, even if it loved the walls of Danzig. (Reuters, August 9th)</p>
<p>(London) It is widely rumored here that the authorities of the Free City of Danzig and representatives of Poland are scheduled to hold negotiations within this week to discuss various issues related to the city's customs. However, this has not yet been confirmed. (Havas Agency, August 9th)</p>
<p>Danzig Regarding the issue of Polish customs officials in the city's customs, after the city council sent a reply to Poland yesterday, the Polish government is drafting a note, and bilateral negotiations can begin in a short period of time. (Havas Agency, August 8th)</p>
<p>Danzig Poland has a military factory and stationed troops in Westerplatte near this city. The Nazi newspaper "Danziger Vorposten" recently reported that Polish troops are digging trenches and installing barbed wire in Westerplatte, which should be protested. It is also difficult to tolerate the presence of Polish troops within the borders of the Free City. (Havas Agency, August 8th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Meets with German Ambassador; Contents of Talk Kept Secret; Possibly Related to Danzig Issue</h3>
<p>(Paris) The authorities are keeping the talks between French Foreign Minister Bonnet and German Ambassador to France Weizsäcker yesterday very secret. There are several reasons to believe that the issue of Franco-German press relations was mentioned in the talks. Some quarters also believe that these talks are related to German military activities and the Danzig issue. U.S. Ambassador Bullitt also visited Bonnet yesterday, and it is expected that Soviet Ambassador Suritz will visit the French Foreign Ministry today. (Reuters, August 9th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Cabinet Reshuffled; Franco Concurrently Serves as Prime Minister; Gains Control of Military and Political Power</h3>
<p>Burgos The new cabinet list was announced today. General Franco will continue to serve as Prime Minister concurrently. General Jordana will be Deputy Prime Minister without concurrently holding a ministerial portfolio. The post of Foreign Minister will be held by Colonel Beigbeder, High Commissioner of Spanish Morocco in North Africa. It was previously said that Interior Minister Suñer would take over as Prime Minister, but he is now slated to concurrently serve as Director of the Political Department of the Falange, which has very broad powers and directly dominates the lives of the Spanish people. The cabinet list is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Prime Minister General Franco (incumbent), Deputy Prime Minister General Jordana (former Foreign Minister), Foreign Minister Colonel Beigbeder (new), Interior Minister Suñer (incumbent), Minister of the Navy Suances (former Minister of Economy), Minister of the Army Davila (former Minister of National Defense), Minister of Finance Larraz (new), Minister of Industry and Commerce Lequerica (current French Ambassador to France), Minister of Agriculture Carcerais (new), Minister of Justice Beles (new), Minister of Education Martin (new). (Havas Agency, August 9th)</p>
<p>In addition, a General Staff Headquarters will be established to supervise the affairs of the staff departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. General Franco will be responsible for the General Staff Headquarters. At the same time, General Franco will also be responsible for the National Defense Council. General Franco may issue decrees on his own without having to convene a cabinet meeting. (Haitong Telegram, August 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid Political figures here recently declared that the Spanish cabinet reshuffle has consolidated General Franco's position and power. The fact that General Franco can issue decrees without having to convene a cabinet meeting has attracted the attention of all sectors of society. In addition, the establishment of a General Staff Headquarters to supervise the Army, Navy, and Air Force, with General Franco in charge of the General Staff Headquarters, means that the Army, Navy, and Air Force are also under General Franco's control.

<h3>German-Japanese Trade Agreement to be Provisionally Implemented from the 15th of this Month</h3>
<p>(London) Responsible sources here recently declared that the German-Japanese trade agreement was initialed on July 28 and will be provisionally implemented from the 15th of this month, officially signed in September, and fully implemented on October 1. Thereafter, when Japanese goods are imported into Germany, the price will be paid in marks into a special account of the Yokohama Specie Bank's Hamburg branch. When German goods are imported into Japan, three-quarters of the price will be paid by Japan in cash, and the remaining one-quarter will be transferred by the Yokohama Specie Bank's Hamburg branch. This agreement applies to the entire territory of Germany, with the exception of the German protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia. (Havas Agency, August 8th)</p>
<h3>In Response to Future Events, Britain Increases Troops in Singapore, Making it the Military Center of the Far East</h3>
<p>(Singapore) The Fifth Regiment of the 14th Punjab Regiment left for Penang by car today. Two more batches of troops will arrive here from India this Friday. (Associated Press, August 9th)</p>
<p>(London) According to "The Yorkshire Post," which has close ties to former Foreign Secretary Eden, Britain has been continuously deploying troops to reinforce Singapore in recent days in order to transform this important British naval and air base in the Far East into an important military center to cope with possible future situations. According to the report, the British government plans to increase the garrison in Singapore to 12,000 men. In the future, the garrisons to be sent to Hong Kong and other parts of the Far East will be dispatched directly from Singapore instead of being drawn from India. If war breaks out in the Far East, Australia and New Zealand will also send troops to Singapore. (Haitong Telegram, August 9th)</p>
<h3>Inflation in Japan; Sharp Increase in the Amount of Paper Money in Circulation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In recent years, the amount of paper money in circulation in Japan has increased sharply. The average amount of paper money in circulation in July was 2,286,000,000 yen, an increase of 380,000,000 yen compared to July 1938 and an increase of 814,000,000 yen compared to the same month in 1937 when the China Incident first broke out. Before the outbreak of the China Incident, the increase in the issuance of Japanese paper money averaged 100,000,000 yen per year. "Asahi Shimbun" claims that if the expansion of Japan's economic enterprises keeps pace, the sharp increase in the amount of paper money in circulation will not be harmful. Unfortunately, the current situation is not so. After the expansion of industry, the nation's ability to absorb public bonds held by financial institutions and the public must increase accordingly. The amount of public bonds currently stored in Japan's treasury shows that the large expansion of Japan's economic enterprises has not yet been realized. (Reuters, August 9th)</p>
<h3>Course of the War in the Nomonhan Region; Soviet-Mongolian Forces Launch a Large-Scale Counterattack and Recross the Khalkhin Gol River</h3>
<p>(Paris) "Le Temps" sent a reporter, Jil, to the Nomonhan region on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo" to report on the war. He recently sent an article that was published in today's "Le Temps." According to the report, the Japanese side regards the Khalkhin Gol River as the boundary line between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia, while the Soviet side believes that the boundary line is north of the river, including the Buerkhia Obo and Noro highlands, and stops south of Hailar City. The boundary dispute remains unresolved. Although this Soviet-Japanese conflict is said to be caused by the boundary line, there are other fundamental reasons: (1) The Soviet side wants to restrain Japan at an opportune time to assist China. (2) The Japanese side, because it is bogged down in a stalemate in China, wants to win a victory on another front to stimulate domestic public opinion. During the first phase of the war, from early May to late June, the Soviet-Mongolian forces advanced to within 80 kilometers of Khalarshan (a strategic railway line starting from Changchun and ending there). In the second phase of the war, several divisions of the Japanese army, with a large amount of military equipment, launched an offensive and drove the Soviet-Mongolian forces out of "Manchukuo" from July 3 to 11. According to the Japanese side, "If a certain person in Tokyo had not come to comfort them at that time, the Japanese army would have definitely followed the wishes of Lieutenant General Komatsubara and invaded Mongolia." Later, the Soviet-Mongolian forces launched a large-scale counterattack with 200 tanks and recrossed the Khalkhin Gol River, but according to the Japanese communiqué, this offensive was repelled. The two sides have only continued to exchange artillery fire, and the air forces have occasionally been active. (Havas Agency, August 8th)</p>
<h3>North Sakhalin Oil Mine Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Reports received here from the Far Eastern Soviet side state that the dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union regarding the oil mines in North Sakhalin Island has been resolved last night, mitigating another crisis between the two countries. It is reported that Japanese oil mine operators in North Sakhalin Island have increased the wages of Soviet workers by 15%. Initially, the Japanese navy adopted a serious attitude towards the North Sakhalin Island dispute because a large portion of its fuel depends on that area. The Soviet court recently ruled that Japanese businesses in North Sakhalin Island be fined. If the Japanese businesses do not pay the fine, their property will be confiscated. The Japanese businesses are accused of violating labor contracts signed with Soviet workers. (U.S. Associated Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Accuses Congressmen of Gambling with Lives; Congressional Delay of Neutrality Act is a Dangerous Gamble</h3>
<p>Hyde Park, USA. President Roosevelt recently hosted reporters at his villa here, marking his first statement since the congressional recess. He stated that a minority of Democratic congressmen, accounting for 20 to 25 percent of the total, collude with Republican congressmen to reject amendments to the Neutrality Act. This behavior is akin to gambling with the lives of the nation, wagering that no war will occur between now and when Congress reconvenes in January next year, so that the Neutrality Act issue can be leisurely discussed after reconvening. This is truly treating the lives of 150 million people as a joke, because if the bet is lost, 150 million lives will be affected. A portion of Congressmen, unaware of their errors, continue to restrain my actions, not allowing me to possess any power to prevent the outbreak of war. Their responsibility is extremely grave. For the sake of all countries in the world and the United States, it is hoped that these people's views are not mistaken and that they can win the bet. I also do not intend to directly consult the people on the Neutrality Act amendment issue. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Chamberlain's Route: Imagining a World "New Order"; British Public Opinion Expresses Disappointment at Anglo-Japanese Compromise</h3>
<p>Revelation of Chamberlain's Major Conspiracy: Britain Plans to Loan Money to Germany as the Price of Peace, and Attempts to Divide China and a Portion of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>London Airmail, Uncle Di</p>
<p>In order to preserve the content and scope of its current empire, Britain has truly exhausted its efforts. We should be understanding of this. Therefore, if the Sino-Japanese War has indeed reached a stage where, without foreign aid, Japan would immediately "perish entirely," then at such a time, if Britain were to step forward to save Japan in order to maintain the balance of power in the Far East, we cannot harshly criticize her for being hostile to China. Any cabinet with imperialist ambitions in Britain would probably do the same, unless the most progressive party is already in power in Britain, in which case, it would be a different matter. However, in the current objective situation, Japan has not reached such a precarious stage. On the contrary, she is still acting madly, stubbornly wanting to annex China and dominate the Far East. At this time, Britain actually comes out to compromise with Japan. This move not only betrays the interests of its ally, China, but also fundamentally shakes Britain's own basic stance. Here, the differences between Britain's current "Chamberlain Cabinet" and most British people are clearly demarcated.</p>
<p>I emphatically reiterate here: the current "Chamberlain Cabinet's Route" in Britain is indeed a very special thing!</p>
<p>If one says that the difference between the policies of Chamberlain and his ilk and the political views of any other group of people in Britain is only a matter of "fifty steps versus a hundred steps," this view is very inaccurate. Sometimes we may fall into serious errors and easily step into irretrievable crises. Once the truth is revealed, we will be at a loss. Last year's Czechoslovakia fell into such a trap of unclear understanding, believing that Britain would never sit idly by and watch its demise, and therefore Chamberlain could not sit idly by and watch its destruction.</p>
<p>We must recognize that Chamberlain and his ilk not only have their special "route" for Europe, but also have their own set of plans for the Far East. Not only that, but if their overall plan works, it will truly create a "new order" in the world. It is better not to talk about these things before the truth is revealed, because the forces striving to combat Chamberlain's route are flourishing all over the world anyway, and this special route has no chance of success. If I say too much about it now, the general public may think it is alarmist, but my intention is only to remind the Chinese people to remember that in the current world, there is such a poisonous thing as a "red snake" existing, and the best contribution from China to combat this route is to strengthen the war of resistance.</p>
<p>The material and spiritual support that Britain has given to China's resistance war in the past two years is an undeniable fact. However, this is only the average result of public opinion and popular will throughout Britain. What should be thanked are naturally the progressive thinkers and truly passionate humanitarians who have promoted it. Even Chamberlain and his ilk are constantly opposing and hindering it. If I now tell everyone that the support of the general progressive and enlightened people in Britain for China's resistance war has come after a hard struggle, and that they are constantly fighting to cope with reaction, perhaps it will be the first time this is heard in China. But this is an ironclad fact. I think there is a best example here; (I was unwilling to bring these examples up before, to expose the truth behind the beautiful surface facts) Last summer, everyone remembers that it was once rumored that Britain had allowed a loan of 20 million pounds to China. Later, it suddenly disappeared without a trace. So, was it just a rumor? Not at all. The actual truth is that other aspects of the British government had already fully agreed, and even Foreign Secretary Halifax completed the formal procedures, but in the end, it was strangled to death in the hands of Finance Minister Simon. The so-called Simon is one of the pillars of the "Chamberlain Route."</p>
<p>Chamberlain and his ilk have never had any goodwill towards China from beginning to end. If we attribute all the facts of Britain's help to China to Chamberlain's account, and therefore have all sorts of hopes for him, and then complain about Britain in general when we encounter disappointment, then it can only be said that our own understanding is unclear.</p>
<p>This time, Britain's sudden compromise with Japan, this news really came too abruptly! As a reporter who has witnessed everything here, I think I can vouch for all of Britain's public opinion and most of the people to prove that this move was completely beyond their expectations. Their indignation towards Japan before the event, and their hatred and bewilderment towards their government afterwards, are no less than ours. Originally, in a country like Britain with freedom of speech and a strong democratic atmosphere, under normal circumstances, if everyone says that they have not heard anything about the government's diplomatic measures beforehand, then it may be a lie. However, this time, it is indeed a rare exception. On the eve of the Munich Conference last year, a few people with relatively informed sources knew a little about it in advance, so the general mood afterwards was only sorrow for Czechoslovakia, but there was no bewilderment. As for this Anglo-Japanese compromise, the diplomatic correspondent of the Times wrote very meaningfully the next day: "Last night, countless hearts in all of London were agonizing over this matter!"</p>
<p>The emergence of this phenomenon is by no means accidental; it is due to the strict sealing off of news by the British government authorities this time. Until the day before Tokyo formally announced the results of the negotiations, what everyone in Britain could know was that the government's instructions to its ambassador to Japan were still strictly limited to the local incident of Tianjin, and did not involve larger issues. Even after Tokyo formally announced the results of the negotiations, the results of everyone's inquiries here still believed that Tokyo's news should be accepted with considerable reservations. It was not until Prime Minister Chamberlain coldly stood up in Parliament and read out the specific clauses of the so-called "formula" that everyone realized that their government had indeed completely succumbed to Japan and betrayed the interests of itself and its allies.</p>
<p>Why did the British government do this? There are several most convenient excuses for this, such as: Britain is concentrating its efforts to deal with the European situation, or because the United States is unwilling to intervene in the Tianjin incident, etc. However, now here, everything inside is completely clear, and everyone knows that this surrender to Japan is just a part of Prime Minister Chamberlain's current plan. All the excuses are in vain and absolutely unbelievable. Therefore, judging from the government's actions in responding to public criticism in the past two days, its focus is still on defending its entire route, and it seems that it is no longer wasting effort to defend the unmaskable sins of the Tokyo negotiations.</p>
<p>Chamberlain's entire plan was originally prepared to be greatly implemented after the congressional recess. At that time, needless to say, news would be completely blocked and absolutely strict secret diplomacy would be conducted. As for the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations and Anglo-Polish negotiations currently underway to appease the public, it is likely that they will be decided to be stopped immediately at that time. Writing here, I would like to point out one more thing by the way. Recently, I saw Chinese newspapers sent to this place, which were filled with Reuters and Havas dispatches about the so-called "new instructions" of the British and French governments, left and right. If you talk about them one by one, you can't help but get the impression that the Soviet Union's diplomatic style seems too——in popular Chinese terms——"building a frame." In fact, this is completely a misunderstanding. The actual truth is that the instructions given by the British and French governments to their representatives, up to this day, are exactly the same as the instructions carried by Strang when he first arrived in Moscow, and have never been "new." Strang has long been very difficult to handle, and asked the government for instructions, intending to return; however, the government's intention is to "consume" it there, even if the negotiations make no progress, and not return. The effect of this is twofold; one is to block Germany's proposal to the Soviet Union for buffer contacts, and the other is to appease the British and French (especially French) people who are terrified. However, in fact, Germany's direct or indirect contacts and suggestions to the Soviet Union have never been blocked. The most pitiful thing is the general public of Britain and France, while their government is pushing the future of their country onto a dangerous path day by day, they are still kept in the dark. Reuters and Havas (if you pay attention, you can also see Havas' urgent hope for the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance.) dispatches, some are to comfort people, and some do represent the wishes of the British and French people. According to a well-informed diplomatic reporter here, since the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations in Moscow, every time the British and French representatives ask the government for instructions, from Moscow to London and Paris, from London to Paris, from Paris to London, and then from London and Paris back to Moscow, it takes at least three days, and up to seven days; while the Soviet Union's reply can be submitted the next day after each negotiation. This is a very interesting statistic that we should savor.</p>
<p>Now let's go back to Chamberlain's current overall plan. Chamberlain's conspiracy is shocking. On July 22, the Daily Telegraph here suddenly revealed a major conspiracy in the most prominent position, which is the so-called Hudson peace plan that has recently stirred up the world. At that time, the newspaper's report only said that, according to this plan, Britain would lend 100 million pounds to Germany as the price of "peace." This has already shocked the entire world! However, the news that has been spreading continuously in the past few days has already known the content is not only that. There are even more absurd major conspiracies, which are prepared to divide China, divide a part of the Soviet Union, re-divide African colonies, and tacitly allow Germany and Italy to enter and exit South America. According to Hudson, the "peace" in the world in the next two or thirty years depends on the realization of this plan. Whether the content put forward by Hudson at that time was only these, because the news is absolutely sealed off, it is still unknown.</p>
<p>However, if we only understand it on the surface, we still will not understand the tricks of these conspirators. Here, I would like to simply write down some of the results I have searched for and discussed here. Immediately after this plan was put forward, Germany rejected it. Why? Germany knows that while Britain is compromising with Japan, it is also putting forward this huge plan to Germany. In fact, it wants to create a gap between Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union, the United States, and China, causing serious conflicts. If Germany and Italy really go to discuss this plan with Britain, then it will not be long before the United States will definitely become active and lead the anti-aggression front, this is one; secondly, Japan intends to monopolize China, in this way, the German-Japanese-Italian front will be dismantled, third, Germany will lose a good customer in China, which is something that British businessmen have long been jealous of; not to mention the big business of China's post-war construction in the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, Germany immediately firmly rejected it. In turn, she asked Britain; your so-called 100 million pounds, as Germany knows, you can't take it out right now; so, where are you going to raise that money? Hudson's answer was: "Raised jointly by the international community." The so-called international community is only the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States. ——Once the matter is revealed, it has now become a laughing stock</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph, originally one of the two major newspapers of the Conservative Party, is known as the Times. This time, the exposure of Chamberlain's conspiracy, making it unable to be realized, has the background of Churchill, Eden, and other Conservative Party figures behind it. They know that if this continues, it is not the crisis of Germany, Italy, or any other country, the biggest crisis is precisely falling on Britain and France, so this is indeed a major blow to Chamberlain's route.</p>
<p>In addition to this blow, the United States' sudden announcement yesterday to notify Japan of the abolition of the U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement is also intended to prevent further compromise between Britain and Japan, and China's President Chiang's recent statement has also exerted great power in Britain. This is another two major blows to Chamberlain's conspiracy. (July 28)</p>
<h3>Nantong Tangzha: Puppet Police Defect and Capture One Japanese Soldier</h3>
<p>Tianshenggang Communication: At the end of last month, the puppet police of Tangzha, ×××, regretted their past mistakes and lured out a Japanese soldier to surrender to the Chinese army. The captured Japanese soldier's name is Yoshio Yamada, from Osaka, and is currently being held at ××.</p>
<h3>Chongming Guerrillas Eliminate Dissidents and Prepare to Attack Chongcheng</h3>
<p>Chongming Communication: The Su Province Border Region Guerrilla Commander Lu Zhoufang's troops, formerly stationed in Haimen and Qidong, were reorganized into the Third Column of the × War Zone × Route last winter, and Lu was appointed as the Column Commander and Zhang Rong as the Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff. Internally, they actively trained. This spring, Lu and Zhang, believing that the Japanese army was entrenched in Chongming, led their troops across the river and launched a fierce attack, fighting between Baozhen and Chenjia Town, killing many Japanese soldiers. However, because there were still miscellaneous troops such as Jiang Xuzhou and Cui Zhenxing's units in the area, who were being used by others to make trouble in the rear, Lu and others recently resolved these miscellaneous troops. Currently, the entire territory of Chongming is under the control of Lu's troops. Lu and others are rectifying their subordinates and preparing to attack Chongcheng.</p>
<h3>Haimen Sanhe Town: Japanese Bomb Falls, Made with Chinese Copper Coins</h3>

Afterwards, villagers went to inspect it and found thousands of Chinese copper coins cut into triangles scattered all over the field. The words "Da Qing", "Guangxu", and "Ten Wen" on the copper coins were still clearly visible.</p>

<h3>Love is Flourishing in the New Autumn</h3>
<p>May all great men in the world not be sinners in love!</p>
<p>Summer mornings and autumn nights are both very rich in poetry. The clear and pure bright moon hangs high in the sky, shining particularly brightly and universally on the earth. At this time, the summer heat has subsided, and the mood is serene. If there are lovers, how can they not be together in pairs, filled with sweet words? The joy of husband and wife is the expression of "seizing the moment" in life. However, friends: do not be sinners in love!</p>
<p>Love is like flowers and trees. To make it flourish, it must be planted in fertile soil, or be frequently irrigated, which is also beneficial. Husbands of the times are full of energy, and their love must be able to flourish in a timely manner. Imagine a couple, both strong and beautiful, how can they not be filled with tender love, give birth to sons and daughters, and form a happy family in this season of spring flowers and autumn moon? Sometimes, husbands occasionally feel lack of energy, and they will immediately engage in cultivation and replenishment. This is the same reason why flowers and trees must be diligently irrigated. However, there are too many men in the world who only want to harvest without asking about cultivation: or they do not know how to cherish their virginity in their early years, and commit self-indulgence and seminal emission: or they waste their reproductive gland fluid after marriage, indulging in荒淫縱慾 from time to time, resulting in depleted essence and exhausted blood, erupting with spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation and impotence, underdevelopment, thin essence and infertility, etc. As a result, the beauty's kindness cannot be enjoyed, even if it is a middle-aged woman, I am afraid she will also be filled with resentment, and a miserable haze will arise between the couple, and the family will fall into a painful city of sorrow. In today's society, it is common to see disputes such as elopement and divorce due to the disharmony of love between couples!</p>
<p>Since the successful research on reproductive gland replenishment therapy, the above-mentioned symptoms have effective treatments. Weak husbands who can actively take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" will be able to save their miserable fate and move forward on the path of health and happiness. Because "Shengzhi Su" is extracted from the bodies of strong animals such as gorillas, bears, deer, and sea dogs, and the reproductive gland hormones are added with precious raw materials for nourishing the brain and kidneys, and replicated by scientific methods. After taking it, it can exert the functions of producing essence and replenishing the kidneys, strengthening the brain and activating blood, nourishing nerves, and promoting development in one day and night. Continued use will surely cure various symptoms radically in a short period of time, and regular use in autumn and winter can achieve the effects of prolonging life, returning to youth, and rejuvenating. This has been proven by famous Chinese and foreign doctors and promoted as a holy medicine among endocrine preparations. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Simito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" (available at Wing On Sincere Pharmacy Department and major pharmacies such as Zhongxi Wuzhou Zhongfa, etc.) to stop emissions, so that both symptomatic and radical treatments are applied, and the effect will be even more rapid.</p>
<h3>Three Stages of Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>A healthy man has the phenomenon of semen leakage due to the long-term storage of semen produced physiologically without use, which is not within the scope of this article. Because the number of semen leakage is very small, there are only one or two similar spermatorrheas in a few months, and the body is not tired or has other abnormalities after leakage. There are also men who simply do not have semen leakage, even after being separated from their beloved wife for several years.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea in its early stage is also suspected to be semen leakage, but it is mostly caused by the stimulation of dreams, while semen leakage does not necessarily have dreams, and even if there is the stimulation of dreams, it does not necessarily cause spermatorrhea. In the initial stage of spermatorrhea, it is easy to leak with slight stimulation from dreams, so the number of spermatorrheas is two or three times a month for mild cases, and often five or six times or more for severe cases. At this stage, doctors usually call it nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>After nocturnal emission has been around for a while, the sperm gate becomes more and more relaxed. At this time, even without the stimulation of dreams, semen will leak out unconsciously, and the number of leakages will also increase, often reaching more than ten times a month. At this stage, it is called spermatic leakage. Nocturnal emission and spermatic leakage are relatively easy to treat. According to my experience, just taking the special medicine "Simito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, reduce dreams, and achieve the effect of sleeping soundly and stopping leakage that night. The worst thing is still self-misuse, then the sperm gate will have no binding power at all. If there is a little semen in the seminal vesicle, then even in the daytime, semen may seep out due to occasional female lust, or after defecation, in this stage, it becomes the most terrible stage of sperm leakage. With spermatic leakage or sperm leakage, semen will inevitably dry up, so symptoms such as weak brain and insomnia, poor memory, back pain, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, underdevelopment, and scattered energy will erupt one after another. Not only can this kind of young people not make progress in academics and careers, but they are also often abandoned by the opposite sex in social interactions, and the married life will not be happy, and the family will fall into a tragic situation!</p>
<p>If the treatment for this kind of symptom still requires taking "Simito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to stop leakage, but it must also be combined with the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to cultivate the brain, kidneys, nerves, and sperm blood, then both symptomatic and radical treatment can be effective.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Wu Zhiren, from Anhui, 25 years old, studying at a certain university, initially suffered from seminal emission due to self-indulgence, and then suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency. He got married last year, and the love between the couple was weak. He was about to graduate, but his academic performance was not good enough. He was deeply distressed, so he sought treatment from me. In addition to instructing him to purchase "Simito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" and "Shengzhi Su" at Wuzhou Pharmacy, he was also given electrotherapy injections. In less than a month, the disease had completely recovered. I heard that he graduated during the summer vacation and went to Hong Kong with his wife to take a new job in the banking industry a few days ago.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>Women with Shrunken, Withered Breasts, Please Reflect!</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>"Envy the fish in the deep pool, better to return and weave a net." This is indeed a famous saying. Because if we see the fish swimming lively in the clear stream, and think of their deliciousness, wanting to satisfy our appetites, if we just stare blankly and don't know how to catch them, then we will be staring blankly for a lifetime and will never taste them.</p>
<p>A woman with shrunken, withered breasts and a thin buttock, so that the health and beauty is lost, seeing the graceful posture and touching beauty of others, constantly feeling both jealous and hateful, or just endlessly envious, is just as ridiculous as envying the fish in the deep pool! Because the reason for shrunken, withered breasts, in our medical judgment, is completely based on the health of the ovaries. If the ovaries are healthy, then not only will the breasts naturally rise high, but the buttocks will also be developed and plump, the voice gentle and melodious, and the temperament will be more gentle and affectionate. At the same time, metabolism will also be vigorous, producing a large number of new cells in the skin, muscles, blood, and other parts, so the muscles can remain delicate and smooth all year round, and the cheeks are more like flowers in spring, appearing delicate and charming. Such women, even without makeup, already feel extremely beautiful, and although age increases, youth can remain. Marital life will be very sweet, building a happy family and giving birth to clever children. This is so happy and joyful! But if in the past there were acts like self-desecration by binding the chest, or suffering from irregular menstruation, persistent leucorrhea, malnutrition, and other symptoms, the ovarian function has been damaged, affecting breast development, then not only will health and beauty be lost and there be no hope of childbirth, but even the love between husband and wife will develop a huge rift, and the fate of such a person will be unthinkable! To seek remedy, one must first actively start with cultivating and tonifying ovarian function. According to famous Chinese and Western gynecologists and my experience, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian endocrine preparation for women, "Reproduction Hormone," is the most effective remedy for the symptoms. Because the ingredients of this agent are precious and well-formulated, after taking it, ovarian function can be cultivated and tonified within a day and night, boosting metabolism, adjusting menstruation, and eliminating uterine diseases. If you continue to take it, breasts will rise high and buttocks will become plump with obvious curves in a short period of time, enhancing health and beauty.</p>

<h3>The Two Concessions are Jointly on Alert, Inspecting Pedestrians with Utmost Rigor; Thousands Arrested for Suspicious Behavior; the Western Badlands of Shanghai are Almost Desolate</h3>
<p>As the second anniversary of the Shanghai War approaches, the authorities of the two concessions, in order to strengthen their security forces, have taken special precautions since yesterday morning. All non-essential roads and lanes at the junction of the two concessions have been blocked off with barbed wire at night, and traffic has been cut off. The defense forces of various countries and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps have been mobilized to assist in the guard, and the precautions are extremely strict. The Japanese side has blockaded the traffic on the Huangpu River and sent motorboats to patrol. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Alert, Strict and Thorough</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Municipal Council, in order to effectively maintain security within the concessions as the anniversary of the Shanghai War approaches, have ordered their respective police departments to step up their alert in advance to prevent unrest. The necessary measures for implementing these precautions have already been jointly agreed upon by the authorities of the two concessions, and special precautions have been started since yesterday morning. All the British, American, French, Italian and other defense forces stationed in Shanghai, as well as the volunteer teams of the French Concession, have been mobilized to assist in the guard. All members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps have also been ordered to work in their offices since yesterday morning, so that they can be mobilized within ten minutes of receiving an order. The thoroughness of the defense is greater than in the past, but the curfew time has not been brought forward.</p>
<p>Blocking Traffic, Deploying Barbed Wire</p>
<p>In the area bordering the British and French Concessions, from the Bund to the Western District, except for the Bund, Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Zhengjia Muqiao, Zhejiang Road, Yu Qiaqing Road, Ma Huo Road, Chongqing Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, and other places that have been left with entrances and exits, all other roads have been ordered by the authorities of the two concessions to be blocked with barbed wire at the intersections by workers starting at midnight yesterday morning. All the lanes along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch in the French Concession have also had their iron gates closed, and residents are entering and exiting through the back lanes. The China United Building has also closed its west-facing gate, leaving only the east-facing gate for entry and exit.</p>
<p>Men and Women Inspected, Separate Searches</p>
<p>In addition to ordering a large number of detectives and dispatching armored vehicles and armored cars to patrol the roads and inspect pedestrians at any time, the police authorities are carrying out extremely strict inspections of pedestrians and vehicles entering and exiting the road intersections at the border. Each passing intersection is guarded by Chinese and Western armed detectives who are carrying out strict searches. The French Concession has also dispatched female inspectors to search women passing to and fro. The situation of the precautions is undoubtedly tense.</p>
<p>Japanese Alert, Motorboats Patrol</p>
<p>Fearing that Chinese guerrillas would take the opportunity to strike, the Japanese and puppet sides were extremely panicked. All the suburbs have already stepped up their alert. All bridges in the Hongkou District, such as Sika Zi Bridge, Yokohama Bridge, Xin Bridge, Jiaxing Road Bridge, Oujia Road Bridge, Waihong Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, Li Hong Bridge, etc., have been uniformly fitted with barbed wire and additional sentry posts have been deployed. It is reported that traffic on the Huangpu River and inland rivers will be blocked in advance, and that many motorboats with machine guns mounted on their bows have been dispatched since yesterday morning, driven by the Japanese navy, and are patrolling between Wusong and Gaochang Temple, and in the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<h3>Uniform A-Type Government Bonds, Eighth Drawing This Morning; Creditworthiness Unparalleled in All Countries; National Salvation Bonds to Pay Interest at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Uniform Government Bonds A-Type Bonds will be drawn for redemption this morning in Shanghai. The National Salvation Bonds will pay interest for the second time at the end of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Creditworthiness Unparalleled in All Countries</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued five types of bonds in 1936: Uniform Government Bonds A, B, C, D, and E. Principal and interest were repaid every year at the end of January and the end of July. After the war, the principal and interest due were repaid on schedule without delay. The creditworthiness has become increasingly good. After the customs duties were seized, the government announced that it would no longer overdraw principal and interest on all previous customs-guaranteed debts. However, in order to protect the interests of bondholders, the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications seventh decision was to allow discounting of the principal and interest of the Uniform Government Bonds. This started on January 31st of last month. Recently, many bondholders have gone to the Shanghai branches of these banks to apply for discounting. In this period of the most intense foreign war, the government is still able to protect the interests of government bondholders, which is unmatched by any country. Therefore, the creditworthiness is unprecedented.</p>
<p>All Side Roads and Lanes Blocked</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the French Concession and Public Concession authorities, in cooperation with the military forces stationed by various countries, began this morning (the 9th) to prevent any atrocities during the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War. Military uniforms and obstacles are "decorating" the streets of Shanghai. Except for a few major thoroughfares, all side roads and back streets are blocked off with obstacles. The methods adopted by the defense forces last year are the same. Defense forces and police patrols are maintaining a strict alert in the two concessions.</p>
<p>Nearly a Thousand Detained</p>
<p>Police in the two concessions conducted continuous searches of various taverns, hotels, and small hostels all night yesterday and this morning. By this afternoon, nearly a thousand people had been detained. These people were arrested because the police investigation into their identities and the reasons for their stay in the investigated area were unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Searching Lodgings, Many Arrested</p>
<p>Starting at 6:00 PM yesterday, police in the Zhabei and Central districts began preventive measures. Special search teams searched hostels and taverns. By night, nearly 350 people had been arrested for failing to provide satisfactory answers when questioned by patrol teams. They will be imprisoned until the current alert is lifted on August 16th.</p>
<p>The Western Badlands of Shanghai are Desolate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps were fully armed and standing by since 5:00 AM this morning, ready to be dispatched at any time to patrol the Public Concession, assisting the police and defense forces, and this will continue until about 5:00 AM on Saturday. The worst area in the Western "Badlands," the Five Corners Market on Avenue Henri Bazin, has become a "no-man's-land" today. Since obstacles have been erected and police patrols have almost doubled, smokers and gamblers are refraining from approaching. The area is desolate, like a town during an air raid warning. Italian troops are maintaining a strict alert in this troublesome area, and patrol teams are patrolling the roads.</p>
<h3>The Two Concessions Began Joint Alert Yesterday</h3>
<p>To prevent the second anniversary of the Shanghai War, the police authorities of the two concessions began special alert yesterday morning, jointly defending. In addition to important traffic arteries, remote lanes and alleys were blocked off. Particular attention was paid to the area bordering the outside of the Western part of Shanghai. On the streets, men and women inspectors separately searched pedestrians and vehicles with extreme rigor. The picture on the left shows the scene of yesterday's alert.

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb British Ship in Yichang; Seriously Wounded First Mate Escapes Danger; Although Both Ships Were Burned, They Still Float on the Water; Many Innocent Chinese in Yichang Die Tragically</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that Japanese military aircraft attacked a British concentration point in Yichang twice on Sunday morning. The Canadian first mate of Jardine Matheson's SS Hsinchangho, Deng Yu, was seriously injured in the second attack. Yesterday (the 8th), it was reported that he was out of danger. During the second attack, the stern of SS Kiaohwa was directly hit by an incendiary bomb and burned along with her sister ship, SS Hsinchangho. Fortunately, the British gunboat HMS Gannet sailed close by and the crew made every effort to put out the fire, so although the ship was burned to the waterline, it was still floating on the river yesterday. Naval officers and commercial personnel are inspecting it to ascertain the actual damage. Deng was injured on the SS Hsinchangho. Earlier telegrams to Shanghai stated that Deng's injuries were serious, so his parents in England had been notified. But yesterday, a telegram from Yichang stated that his injuries were not serious. Deng has been working for Jardine Matheson since November 1936. The two protests submitted by Rear Admiral Holt, commander of the British Yangtze Flotilla, to the Japanese naval authorities have not been answered as of yesterday. The Japanese navy denied that its planes participated in the attack on Yichang and forwarded the protest to the Japanese army. After the first air raid on Sunday morning, HMS Gannet immediately berthed alongside the commercial ships at the British concentration point. During the second attack, SS Hsinchangho and SS Kiaohwa caught fire. The ship was in a dangerous position, but still did rescue work. Three representatives from Jardine Matheson boarded the British ship HMS Scorpion yesterday to thank the British navy for their assistance. HMS Gannet, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walbourne, braved the danger of being bombed by Japanese planes and sailed close to the burning SS Kiaohwa and SS Hsinchangho to extinguish the fire. Then, it assisted other commercial ships and tugboats to sail to safety. The first air raid occurred at 5:00 AM on Sunday morning. Twelve Japanese planes dropped bombs on the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil depots. Two bombs directly hit a warehouse. Other bombs fell into the river near SS Kiaohwa and SS Hsinchangho, as well as on the property of Moller &amp; Co. At 11:00 AM, the second air raid occurred. Japanese planes dropped bombs on almost the same locations. The second bomb hit the stern of SS Kiaohwa and started a fire. The flames immediately spread to SS Hsinchangho. Both ships were destroyed. Two Chinese sailors on SS Hsinchangho died and three were injured. Yichang city was bombed, and material losses were heavy. Many non-combatant Chinese died tragically.</p>
<h3>Corpses from the Two Concessions Cannot be Transported Into Each Other; Funeral Homes Have Requested Accommodation</h3>
<p>Because the funeral parlors and coffin depositories in the Public Concession are full of corpses and coffins, and it is difficult to accommodate the storage of corpses and coffins from outside the concession, which hinders public health, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has notified all funeral parlors to prohibit the acceptance of corpses for funerals and coffin deposition from outside the concession from now on. At the same time, the French Concession Municipal Council has also stopped issuing permits for the transport of corpses from within the French Concession into the Public Concession. However, the funeral parlors believe that such restrictions will inevitably have a considerable impact on their business, so they plan to request the authorities of the two concessions to provide accommodation.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Cables Order to Stop Speculation in Cotton Yarn; Trading in Japanese Yarn Violates Prohibition Regulations; Chinese Merchants Must Prevent Foreign Merchants from Interfering; Japanese Dreams of Disrupting Trade Fail</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reported that, according to reports, there are one to two thousand Chinese people doing cotton yarn trading in Shanghai. It has been investigated that the address is 259 Jiangxi Road, the location of the Anda Bank. There is a sign hanging at the entrance that reads "Shanghai Cotton Yarn Industry Amateur Research Association," and a sign hanging upstairs that reads "Shanghai Cotton Yarn Industry Intermediary Society." Every day, in the morning and afternoon, people from various yarn firms and yarn factories with badges enter to do business. Those without badges are not allowed to enter. What they are trading is domestic and Japanese yarn. All transactions are based on warehouse receipts.</p>
<p>Warehouse Receipt Transactions, Manipulating Yarn Prices</p>
<p>Warehouse receipts are divided into internal and external types. External warehouse receipts are for goods already in the warehouse and can be picked up at any time. They can be regarded as spot transactions. Internal warehouse receipts are for goods that have not yet been produced and are traded based on the warehouse receipt. Buyers and sellers only need to give the yarn firm a certain amount of margin. The warehouse receipt is stored with the yarn firm as collateral for advances to customers. If a good price is encountered, both parties can settle at any time. The market price per bale is six yuan less than external warehouse receipts and can be regarded as futures transactions. It actually contains speculative properties. The method is without bidding and without hanging signs. The Shanghai yarn price is the market price formed by transactions in this place. The prohibition regulations and the regulations on prohibited items all have clear provisions prohibiting and punishing this. Shanghai merchants in all industries must strictly abide by the regulations in order to comply with the original intention of economic severance.</p>
<p>Intra-Industry Trading, Prevent Purchases</p>
<p>Currently, this trading place is trading in domestic and Japanese yarn. Its transmission and introduction of Japanese yarn trading is a prohibited act. Furthermore, the sale of domestic yarn in this kind of place will inevitably be exploited by people. It should be strictly stopped. In addition, the trading place is divided into futures and spot trading, and the warehouse receipts transactions are most likely to lead to speculation and manipulation. It should also be corrected. The Ministry should cable the yarn factories and yarn firms participating in the trading to stop the illegal behavior of the trading place by a certain date. Trade between Chinese merchants in the same industry must prevent foreign merchants from interfering, and they must abide by industry rules, not create clever names, or open up transactions using other methods with speculative properties.</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt to Re-Establish, Gold Industry Trading</p>
<p>Da Guang She reported that the Japanese side, in view of the fact that the five exchanges for yarn, cloth, gold, securities, flour, and miscellaneous grains in this port have been suspended due to the fall of Shanghai, and their attempt to disrupt the market with mixed trading has become a dream, secretly sent Eiichi Sugimura to collude with a group of traitors to carry out activities everywhere, planning to organize a large-scale illegal gold exchange, hoping to re-establish the Japanese exchange and gold industry trading that the Ministry of Finance had abolished. The address has already been found on a certain building on Sichuan Road. The number of brokers is set from number one to number fifty, enticing merchants, hoping to realize it soon. As a result, the Chinese people are deeply aware of righteousness and are unwilling to cooperate and be used by them, and it has already ended in miscarriage.</p>
<p>Japanese Exchange Trading Impossible</p>
<p>Yesterday, a person from the exchange industry told the Da Guang She reporter that the illegal trading being promoted by the Japanese side has been in preparation for a long time. All its functions are still nothing more than the usual techniques of controlling the economy and manipulating the market. Chinese merchants must not cooperate, because once they take the wrong step, they will be unable to redeem themselves forever and will never escape their nets. According to many observations, it is no longer possible for Japanese merchants to re-establish an exchange for Japanese currency. As for the gold trading currently under Japanese control, it is still an illegal organization like before. Its scale is simple and its business is slack, and it is not worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3>Sand and Gravel are Completely Controlled; Previously Signed Contracts are Void; Market Transactions are Temporarily Suspended; Construction Projects Cannot Proceed</h3>
<p>The sand and gravel required by various construction factories in this city are all purchased from Sijiao by various help dealers. However, since the Shanghai War, the environment in Shanghai has been special, and sand and gravel have also been controlled. An incident once occurred, and now it has been controlled again. The source has been cut off, and the stock has been exhausted. The Sand and Gravel Industry Guild has no way to deal with it. In addition to requesting the concession authorities to help dredge, the contracts signed with construction factories have also been voided, and market transactions have been suspended. The future is truly worrying. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Market Suspended</p>
<p>The Simalu Sand and Gravel Market is organized and established by the member firms of the Sand and Gravel Industry Guild. Its business hours are from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day. All goods between the industry are negotiated and traded in the market. Now, the sand and gravel from all places have been controlled, and no goods are shipped to Shanghai. Although the industry guild has repeatedly tried to dredge the source, it has been unable to do so because of its inability to support it. It has also repeatedly decided to request to help dredge it, so as to avoid the suspension of construction projects within the concession and maintain the business of the industry firms. Now, the sand and gravel market has been completely suspended, and the future is worrying.</p>
<p>Contracts Void</p>
<p>The Sand and Gravel Industry Guild issued another special announcement yesterday, saying that because the industry is controlled by a certain party, members of the guild have always used their own ships to mine and transport sand and gravel to supply the construction industry in Shanghai. As in late last month, ships that were loaded and arrived in Shanghai were all detained and unloaded, and ships that have not been loaded cannot go to mine and transport, so the source of sand and gravel within the concession has been completely cut off, and the stock stored within the concession has long been exhausted. All contracts signed by members with construction factories and users cannot be fulfilled. Now, because the situation is constantly changing, it is also beyond our ability to do so. We are afraid that there are still construction companies who do not understand the truth, so we solemnly declare again that all contracts signed before are void. We hope that all construction companies and users will forgive us. We hereby announce, please understand.</p>
<h3>After the Government Denied the Rumors, the Financial Market Became Stable; Banks and Qian Zhuang Persisted in Implementing Government Orders; However, General Speculators Still Manipulated as Usual</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank denied the rumors, the Shanghai financial market became slightly more stable, but speculators still manipulated as usual. However, the Qian Zhuang made every effort to prevent investment, preserve its strength, and diverted investment funds to the Southwest. At the same time, it persisted in implementing government orders. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hot Money Gathers in Shanghai, Speculation Flourishes</p>
<p>Although the center of finance and trade has shifted inward after the fall of Shanghai, international exchange rates are still centered on Shanghai. Furthermore, because the number of people fleeing to Shanghai from various places is increasing day by day, the funds that previously flowed into the interior have now re-concentrated in Shanghai. Small industry, commerce, and the real estate industry within the concession are quite active, but the use of funds is becoming increasingly narrow due to the excellent investment channels, making it even more difficult, and creating the rise of speculative activities, such as black market foreign exchange arbitrage, trading in foreign currency, gold, and securities, hoarding of various commodities, and renting and building of real estate, leading to speculators in the financial market to create rumors intentionally, causing market fluctuations, soaring prices, and affecting the livelihoods of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Preserve Strength and Colonize Resources in the Southwest</p>
<p>As for the formal banks and Qian Zhuang, although they have normal investment channels, they do not engage in speculative activities that are inconsistent with the government's wartime financial policies. They unanimously reject loans for speculative activities in order to avoid fueling speculation. Regarding their own emphasis on preserving strength, they are gradually trying to divert their resources to the Southwest. Regarding the movement of funds, they strive for balance and stability, so that it will directly and indirectly benefit the overall financial situation. At the same time, they persist in implementing government orders. As for the international Shanghai, it is difficult to predict whether its position and situation will be able to restore its pre-war state, or how it will evolve.</p>
<p>Remittance System Highly Effective</p>
<p>Since the joint preparatory committee of the banking industry handled the use of interbank transfers, the number of Qian Zhuang using it has increased day by day due to the excellent system. The Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications also applied to the committee for the payment of the principal and interest of the Uniform Government Bonds due for circulation in the market. It is said that the total amount of funds currently circulating in the market has exceeded 10 million yuan, and there is no shortage of chips in the market. However, in order to prevent fueling speculation, special emphasis is placed on the use of remittances. Regarding the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, it is difficult to adopt a tight monetary policy in the Shanghai market, but in order to regulate interbank finance and cope with the withdrawal and deposit of 500 yuan or less by Qian Zhuang, they will convert the 22 million yuan in remittances deposited in the treasury by Qian Zhuang into legal tender in stages for circulation.</p>
<p>Find Ways to Stop Remittance Discount</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the remittance bill system, the supply of remittances has exceeded demand, so remittance discounts have occurred. Now, it has gradually increased from six or seven yuan per thousand yuan to more than two hundred yuan. Previously, the Bank of China, the Central Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications once came out to maintain it, so the discount stabilized at around 50 yuan. Since the implementation of the new remittance system, the three banks have no longer maintained the remittance discount, because maintaining the discount would fuel speculation. At the same time, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting it to ban it and quickly devise sound and effective measures. It is said that the Banking and Qian Zhuang Guilds are now studying how to stop the remittance discount, and members of the two guilds have vowed not to engage in this improper business.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Has Deviated from Normal; Market Rumors Abound, Order is Chaotic; High Quality Rice Rises Endlessly, Closing Early</h3>
<p>Because speculative merchants disregard merchant ethics, spread rumors, manipulate the rice market, and hoard large quantities, they take the opportunity to be active, make secret deals, and disregard the law, causing market order to be chaotic, rumors to abound, and people to be uneasy. Although the authorities of the two concessions and leaders of the bean and rice industry have repeatedly contacted each other to stabilize the rice market, the stock of rice has decreased and the source of domestic rice is not strong, so secret deals are becoming more and more rampant. Yesterday, the market opened at 9:00 AM, and the prices of all goods continued to rise. The price of high-quality japonica rice broke the 26 yuan mark. The market was noisy, and the market had no choice but to close early at 11:30 AM.</p>
<p>Warehouse Rice Stock Investigation Completed</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng She reporter learned from the relevant parties in the bean and rice market yesterday that the Rice Management Committee of the two concessions, in order to find out the exact number of rice stocks in Shanghai rice warehouses, planned to investigate the number of rice stocks in order to find ways to increase the stock. Now, the investigation procedures have been completed. Once it is sorted out, it can be officially released, and at that time, it will advise the hoarders to release the rice and supply the market in order to maintain the people's food. It is also determined to ban the current secret deals in the market.</p>
<p>Decision to Protect Within the Police Authority</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Shops Industry Guild previously sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting it to stop the harassment of the Yiding Panlu rice shop by thugs. Now, the Municipal Council has replied, saying that on July 7th of this year, a Yiding Panlu rice shop delivered rice to a certain address near the same road, which happened to be in a location outside the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council police. The buyer only agreed to pay 15 yuan per picul. The shop assistant refused, and a quarrel broke out. Later, the rice was taken back by the shop assistant, and it was over. Since then, no similar incidents have occurred in the same area. In short, the Municipal Council will of course pay more attention to protecting all rice shops within the scope of the police authority, but it is of course impossible to protect goods sent to areas outside its jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Man Tung Steamer Takes Over Transportation Between Tianjin and Tanggu</h3>
<p>The British Taikoo Company's Yangtze steamer "Wu Lin" remained berthed on the Hankou riverfront after Chinese troops withdrew from Hankou in the winter of the year before last, along with the Changsha steamer "Wu Song" and Jardine Matheson's "Long He," "Bao He," and "Ji He" steamers, etc. They were under constant threat and could not move. The "Wu Lin" steamer, at the beginning of June this year, was replaced and returned to Shanghai after the company's Wuhu steamer transported British troops stationed in Hankou to Hankou.</p>
<p>The "Wu Xue" steamer, which usually travels the downstream Xin'gang route, entered the dock for repairs, and the "Wu Lin" steamer replaced it. Now that the "Wu Xue" steamer has completed repairs, it is scheduled to resume sailing the day after tomorrow (the 12th). The "Wu Lin" steamer will likely be suspended again. However, the company's "Man Tung" steamer, which previously traveled the Qi-Hai line, has recently been transferred to Tianjin to serve as a lighter between Tanggu and Tianjin. Because the "Sheng Jing" and "Shun Tian" steamers cannot sail to Tianjin due to the shallow water in the Bai River recently, they remain berthed in Tanggu. Therefore, passengers and cargo bound for Tianjin must be transported to Tianjin by lighters. The "Man Tung" steamer will take over the</p>
<p>Bai River Lighter Transportation</p>
<p>matters. The Qi-Hai route will be taken over by the "Wu Lin" steamer, scheduled to begin its first voyage to Qi-Hai this morning. As for Jardine Matheson's "Tong He" steamer, after completing boiler repairs, it set sail on the Qi-Hai route on the day before yesterday (the 8th). According to the company yesterday, the next voyage of the "Tong He" steamer (tomorrow morning) will be to Xin'gang, and the subsequent voyage will be to Qi-Hai. For example, it will sail to Xin'gang tomorrow and then sail to Qi-Hai on the next voyage. The "Yi He" steamer will continue to regularly sail the Qi-Hai route.</p>
<h3>Handling of Postage Stamps After the Circulation of Fractional Currency Notes; Extremely Difficult to Recall; Allowing Their Use Seems More Feasible</h3>
<p>One-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes are rumored to be available for use in Shanghai by the end of this month, resulting in concerns regarding postage stamp usage. The stamps have been in circulation for a long time and are worth about 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The issue of</p>
<p>postage stamp disposal</p>
<p>is gradually causing anxiety in all sectors. Because these postage stamps have been used in place of cash for a long time, most are damaged. According to Article 9 of the postal regulations, "Damaged postage stamps lose their validity. The same applies to postcards, which are specially made postal stationery, where the value indicated by the design is damaged." A reporter from the Datong News Agency, believing that this matter concerns the public and involves</p>
<p>significant interests,</p>
<p>visited Mr. Wang Weisheng, assistant to the postal administration bureau, yesterday morning. The reporter asked about the issue of disposing of these postage stamps. According to Mr. Wang, from his personal standpoint, he sympathizes with the public, including his own family, who will have such postage stamps. However, from the perspective of the post office, according to postal regulations, damaged postage stamps are of course invalid and</p>
<p>cannot be used</p>
<p>on any mail. Although Mr. Wang said this, the reporter pointed out that the use of postage stamps as currency is a major change in China's monetary system. Those who originally drafted the postal regulations may not have foreseen this. Therefore, this abnormal situation requires handling with flexibility and reason. Regarding this, Mr. Wang indicated to the reporter that if a legitimate organization were to</p>
<p>provide suggestions</p>
<p>to the post office, the post office would certainly be happy to accept them. However, it must be submitted to the highest postal authorities for approval. The reporter then visited Mr. Huang Baohua, head of the branch office management team, who also expressed sympathy for the matter. However, he believed that it would be difficult to recall the postage stamps because the printing cost of a one-cent stamp is no less than its face value. Therefore, it would be difficult for the post office to bear this loss. However,</p>
<p>allowing their continued use</p>
<p>is more feasible. But in the current situation, there are many cases of discarded postage stamps that have already been stamped being washed and reused fraudulently. Therefore, there are concerns about identifying genuine stamps from fake stamps. Mr. Huang also stated that his remarks were purely personal in nature, as he could not express any official position until a solution was found.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Road Construction Workers Request Wage Increase</h3>
<p>Road construction workers in the Public Concession have jointly sent a letter to the First Special District Citizens' Federation, which reads: "We respectfully inform you that due to the constant rise in prices, life is becoming increasingly difficult. The coolies who rely on wages for a living are finding it impossible to survive. Even the large pancakes and fried dough sticks that coolies rely on for sustenance have increased by 100% (last month, each item was only one cent; since this month, it has increased to two cents). Other expensive items are beyond the reach of coolies. Now, various industries have increased salaries, and even the Public Works Department, the administrative body of the concession, has implemented salary increases. Unfortunately, lower-level coolies have not been able to enjoy the same rights, which is deeply regrettable. We are all coolies serving the Public Works Department, with a daily wage of only 65 cents. There is no wage on Sundays or when work is stopped. When it rains, there is only half a day's work. According to annual statistics, the working time is less than two-thirds of the year. Based on this calculation, our road workers' wages are less than 45 cents per day. It is impossible to survive on such low wages and afford expensive living expenses, let alone support a family. Because this matter concerns our personal suffering, we have repeatedly requested the Public Works Department to grant us the same salary increase as Chinese and foreign employees, to help the coolies. We have long admired your association's concern for the suffering of ordinary people. Therefore, we specially request you to forward our situation to the Public Works Department for consideration of the difficult times and to grant an appropriate increase to provide relief, which would be greatly appreciated."</p>

<h3>Da Zhong Bank Employee Chen Weiling Entices and Conceals Wei Gong Dance Girl; Lin Shuzhen Missing Without a Trace; Two Other Persons Involved Based on Confessions</h3>
<p>Chen Weiling, a Wuxi native and employee of Da Zhong Bank at No. 8, Lane 597, Seymour Road, was reported to the Lao Zha police station by Lin Zhencheng, the father of Lin Shuzhen (19 years old), a dance girl from Wei Gong, on suspicion of enticing and concealing her. Chen was handed over to the First Special Court, requesting detention for investigation. The details have been published in the newspapers. During the investigation, according to Chen's confession, on the afternoon of the 26th of last month, Lin Shuzhen used a telephone to invite him to</p>
<p>discuss leaving her family.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, Shuzhen agreed to temporarily hide with him at the Guotai Hotel on Baliqiao Street. During the day, she hid at the home of Dong Meimei (20 years old, from Pudong), a relative of Chen, at No. 5, Zhu Jia Ku, Haig Road. The police immediately ordered detectives to arrest them at the address, but Lin Shuzhen had already fled elsewhere. Only the suspect, Dong Meimei, was arrested. According to Dong's confession, Li Yuanqing (28 years old, Ningbo native, customs water police), a person involved in the matter, was also arrested and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One, requesting detention. The head of the Criminal Division, Qian Hongye, interrogated them.</p>
<p>According to Dong Meimei's confession,</p>
<p>Chen Weiling accompanied Lin Shuzhen to her house every morning from the 27th of last month and accompanied her back to the Guotai Hotel in the evening. After the incident, Lin was taken away by Li Yuanxiang and hid at No. 1, Lane 739, Maichiqi Road in the French Concession. According to the defendant Li Yuanqing's confession, he did not know about the matter. After he was arrested, he was taken to Maichiqi Road for a search by police detectives. After reviewing the statements, the court ordered the defendants to be detained and scheduled to be tried together with Chen Weiling on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>Landlord Sun Wenquan Accused of Defamation; Accused of Calling Tenant a Guerrilla After Failed Attempt to Force Rent Increase</h3>
<p>Sun Wenquan, who runs the Xingda, Zhengda, and Xieda rice stores in the French Concession, owns several houses on Avenue Joffre. Recently, Tao Jianhua, his tenant at No. 578, Avenue Joffre, hired lawyer Sun Qiying to file a private prosecution against Sun in the Criminal Division of the Special Court for defamation and other crimes. It is claimed that the plaintiff has rented the defendant's house on Avenue Joffre for ten years and has never been in arrears. The defendant insisted on forcing a rent increase, and when that failed, he spread rumors that the plaintiff was the commander of a guerrilla unit, was arrested by someone, and there has been no news of him since. Therefore, he took back the house, falsely claiming that the plaintiff owed fifty yuan in rent, deceiving the court into executing the eviction. As a result, the court rejected the claim. Therefore, a lawsuit was filed for defamation under Article 313 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, the court summoned the plaintiff based on the complaint, and the plaintiff testified as above. When questioned, the defendant Sun Wenquan admitted to the above. The court reviewed the statements and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3>Woman Fickle; Man Abandoning; Pawnshop Clerk Entices Newlywed Woman; Sued for Enticement and Fraud</h3>
<p>Li Nianzhen, a woman from Sichuan, is 21 years old and beautiful. After marrying Peng Dajiang in Shanghai on January 12th of this year, a Ningbo native named Zhang Qiujiang, 27 years old, who works as an accountant at Hechang Canvas Shop at No. 23, Ningbo Road, saw Li's beauty and tried to seduce her by bragging about his wealth. Li was deceived by Zhang's</p>
<p>sweet words and hired Zhang to hire a lawyer to handle the divorce proceedings with her husband, Peng Dajiang. On May 4th, Zhang enticed Li to the Lushan Apartments, booked rooms 14 and 24, and had illicit relations with her for several nights. Then, they continued to meet at the Continental Hotel. Later, Zhang, under the pretext of safekeeping, swindled Li out of her 1,000 yuan savings passbook in the Bank of China and then disappeared. After being abandoned, Li realized she had been deceived. She is now pregnant and has no means of support. She has lost both her chastity and her money and is extremely angry. Recently, she filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Zhang of</p>
<p>enticement and fraud. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Minsheng opened the Second Criminal Court to hear the case. The plaintiff, Li Nianzhen, tearfully recounted the circumstances of being enticed and defrauded. The defendant, Zhang Qiujiang, evaded the questions, claiming that the plaintiff was making false accusations. The court reviewed the statements and ordered the defendant to post bail, scheduling another hearing for the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Opened Fire to Resist Arrest; Three Thieves Caught; Detained for Further Investigation and Interrogation</h3>
<p>On July 30th, detectives from the Gordon Road police station arrested three bandits, Bao Bichen, Wang Jinlong, and Gao Yongshou, all from Jiangbei, near Shunde Road and McLean Road. They were handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent back to the Third Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that during the investigation, it was found that the defendants, Dou Bichen and Wang Jinlong, colluded with Wang Wangzi and other eight accomplices, each armed with pistols, Mauser pistols, and hand grenades, at approximately 9:10 PM on December 24th of last year, invaded the machine factory of Huang Jingui, a Yancheng native, at No. 117, Lane 714, Xiaoshadu Road. Knowing that it was time to pay workers' salaries, they were certain that there would be money. They used their guns to threaten and prevent anyone from making noise, robbing 200 yuan in banknotes and gold jewelry, totaling 386 yuan. They tried to escape. The detectives from the Gordon Road police station rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest, and a Western police officer from No. 66, Sandao Wharf, was almost hit. At that time, the bandits escaped from the factory roof. It was found that the defendant Dou Bichen was a relative of the victim, Huang Jingui, and was the one who tipped them off. It is requested that the case be adjourned for further investigation. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the defendants and ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Stole Manager's Handgun; Planned Illegal Activities; Zheng Azhen Detained Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>Zheng Azhen, a Ningbo native and tea boy at the Netherlands Bank, stole a handgun belonging to the manager, Huisaier, on March 8th of this year and hid it under the floor of the Shenghongtai Wine Shop at No. 386, Zhejiang Road. On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, he discussed with his fellow shopkeepers, Wang Ayan and Zhang Youliang, taking out the gun, hiding it on their bodies, and going to the Xian Shi Amusement Park's Beijing opera to commit illegal acts. Detectives learned of this, arrested them, and handed them over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the police filed a public prosecution for endangering public safety and theft. After a brief interrogation by Judge Qian, he ordered them to be detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Million-Dollar Inheritance Case; Accountant Sues for Unpaid Fees</h3>
<p>Jiang Guopei, a Nanjing native, 28 years old, residing at No. 43, Yongnian Lane, Baike Road, is the youngest son of Jiang Xingjie, a descendant of Jiang Donkey. After Jiang Xingjie died of illness in 1934, his millions of yuan in assets were controlled by his stepmother, Jiang Yangshi. In 1936, Sun Shaoqing hired lawyers He Shimie, Ling Qihong, Fan Gang, and accountant Wang Zikang on behalf of Jiang Guopei to file a lawsuit to divide the million-yuan inheritance and audit the accounts. At that time, it was agreed that He Shimie's fees would be 20,000 yuan and Wang Zikang's would be 6,000 yuan. As a result, the case was settled, and Jiang Guopei only received tens of thousands of yuan. The lawyers' and accountants' fees were paid by Sun Shaoqing on his behalf. He Shimie's fee was reduced by 3,000 yuan, but Wang Zikang has not yet received his fee. Recently, he filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering Jiang Guopei to pay the 6,000 yuan fee. Yesterday, Judge Gui summoned him for questioning. The defendant, Jiang Guopei, appeared in court with his lawyer, Zheng Lintong, and submitted evidence that Sun Shaoqing had paid the fees on his behalf. The court ordered an adjournment for investigation and further questioning.</p>
<h3>After Autumn Begins, The Weather Is Hot and Sultry; Yesterday's Temperature Was 93.2 Degrees</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has been hotter than the peak summer heat since the Beginning of Autumn on the 8th. Yesterday at noon, the temperature rose to 93.2 degrees. Shortly after, there was a heavy downpour. It rained again in the evening, but it stopped soon after, and the weather remained hot and sultry.</p>
<h3>Tea Exports Show Robust Growth; Exports to Hong Kong Surge; Account for More Than Half of Total Exports</h3>
<p>Tea is a major export commodity for China, with an annual foreign trade value of over 10 million yuan. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, tea-producing areas in Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces have either been occupied or faced transportation obstacles, making procurement and transportation difficult. However, since the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission controlled the purchase, tea produced in various provinces has been transported overseas according to the planned plan. Although the total national export volume from January to May this year decreased by more than 12,000 piculs compared to the same period last year, according to Hong Kong trade statistics, the volume of Chinese tea shipped to Hong Kong from April to May this year increased by more than 21,000 piculs compared to the same period last year. This is because the Chinese authorities have been committed to the national economy since the War of Resistance and have established a special trading company in Hong Kong as a transshipment hub. According to reliable estimates, Chinese tea exports to Hong Kong account for more than half of all exports, making it the largest export destination. Morocco and various European and American countries also have considerable numbers. The high volume of green tea exports further demonstrates the success of the government's efforts to support the tea industry.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Manager Accused of Theft and Embezzlement; Address Unknown, Awaiting Further Summons for Verification</h3>
<p>Jin Zhenchao, 27 years old, a Ningbo native and manager of Tianyuanxiang Department Store at No. 1183, Haig Road (Xujiahui Town), hired lawyer Liu Yan to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court against the former manager, Bao Ruichen, for robbery, theft, and embezzlement, with an attached civil suit seeking the return of keys, account books, and other items. It is claimed that the defendant was the former manager of Tianyuanxiang Department Store. Due to violations of partnership agreements, the board of directors resolved to remove him from his position as manager on July 7th of this year and elected the plaintiff as manager. However, after being removed from his position, the defendant continued to live in the store. On the 25th of this month (i.e., July), the defendant suddenly urged the store's employees and apprentices to close the store early at 9:00 PM. Everyone believed that the defendant had already been dismissed and had no right to make such demands, so they did not obey his orders. The defendant suddenly grabbed a bunch of keys from the plaintiff, opened the cash box himself, and stole all the account books. After the plaintiff reported this to the shareholders, they ordered the defendant to return them, but he refused. The next day, the defendant reported to the police station, accusing the plaintiff of injuring his body. After the police chief's interrogation, it was determined that the defendant's report was false and rejected the case. The defendant's actions constitute the crimes of robbery, theft, and embezzlement. A lawsuit is filed to investigate and prosecute, and to recover the keys and account books. Based on the above,</p>
<p>Judge Zhang Minsheng opened a court hearing yesterday morning, but the defendant did not appear because his address was unknown and the summons could not be delivered. The plaintiff was also represented by a lawyer and presented the case. The hearing was adjourned and the defendant was ordered to be summoned again for verification.</p>
<h3>Family Dispute Causes Principal Issue</h3>
<p>Zhang Fuhua, the principal of Jingli Primary School on North Shanxi Road in Shanghai, was allegedly encouraged by his mother and sister to have the board of directors appoint lawyer Shen Ronghua as the principal due to a family dispute. Shen once went to the school to take over but was refused. Recently, lawyer Shen, in his capacity as the new principal, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering the transfer of duties. The court summoned both parties for questioning on the 2nd of this month. The case was</p>
<p>deemed incomplete and</p>
<p>rescheduled for a retrial at 10:00 AM yesterday, with all board members summoned to court. Judge Peng Shi presided over the hearing in the Civil Division One. Lawyer Shen Ronghua, representing the plaintiff, and lawyers Dai Ningrui and Chen Mao Xuan, representing the defendant, arrived. Only Wu Yaqin, a member of the board of directors, arrived for the board of directors. Wu claimed that Zhang Fuhua's knowledge was immature, his experience was weak, and that he had held the school's administration without being appointed by the board of directors, acting as principal without authorization. The defendant's lawyer presented a rebuttal, proving that the defendant had a high school diploma and</p>
<p>was legally qualified</p>
<p>to serve as principal. Furthermore, the defendant was a founder and a natural member of the board of directors, so how could the board of directors hold a secret meeting? The appointment of the defendant as principal was officially approved by the board of directors a year ago, as evidenced by the minutes of the meeting, and cannot be said to be unauthorized. Furthermore, appointing a lawyer as a small school principal is contrary to educational laws. The board of directors had previously published an advertisement in the newspapers, publicly claiming that the defendant had falsely claimed to be a founder as an adopted son. So, what does</p>
<p>adopted son have to do with</p>
<p>the board of directors? Director Wu had no response. Finally, the defendant's lawyer stated that the defendant had separately sued the board of directors for holding an illegal meeting and requested that the resolution be declared invalid. This case should be suspended pending a judgment on the defendant's lawsuit. The judge approved and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Inspectors Arrested</h3>
<p>Five men wearing Chinese and Western clothing with badges suddenly appeared at the Guole Pharmacy on Huang兀 Road, Haig Road, Xujiahui, claiming to be inspectors from the Shanghai Charity Federation's refugee relief health team. They stated that they had discovered that the pharmacy was distributing unclean medicines to refugees, which was harmful to their health, and came to investigate. They showed their badges and their tone seemed to be intended to extort money. The pharmacy inquired with the Charity Federation and other organizations, but found no such thing, and reported to the local French police station, who sent detectives to arrest two of them. The remaining criminals had escaped.</p>
<h3>Water Bills Increased Not Long Ago; Another 30% Rent Increase; Tenants in Siwen Lane Can't Afford It</h3>
<p>In Siwen Lane, East and West, on Xinzha Road, a rent dispute occurred once this spring. Later, the tenants agreed to pay an additional water fee equal to 10% of the rent, starting in March of this year, in order to avoid trouble. However, all the tenants in the lane received a rent increase notice from lawyer Guo Qiming, representing Yifeng Foreign Company, which read: "We hereby inform you that our client, Yifeng Foreign Company, has recently received a letter from the owner of Siwen Lane, stating that at the beginning of this year, the exchange rate of the British pound was above eight pence, but recently it has shrunk sharply to four pence, resulting in a loss of more than 100%. It is requested to increase the rent by 50% to compensate. Although a small amount of water fee was collected in March of this year, the water fee paid by our company in recent months has increased by more than 1,000 yuan (the water fee in March was only over 2,000 yuan, but recently it has increased to 4,000 yuan). The small amount of water fee collected earlier cannot make up for the loss. In addition, the price of gold has soared, and the exchange rate of the British pound has shrunk sharply. The landlord's loss, just comparing the exchange rate in March with this month, is indeed more than 100%. Therefore, increasing the rent is unavoidable. However, a sudden increase of 50% is also inappropriate. Therefore, our company, taking into account the long-term relationship between the landlord and the tenants, and the interests of both parties, has decided to increase the rent by 30%, effective from September of this year. Therefore, we entrust you with the task of sending a letter to each tenant, requesting that you understand our company's difficult situation, and agree to this increase, so as to avoid disputes. I sincerely hope that all tenants will take note of this and send a representative to our office within a week to discuss this matter in person, so that it can be resolved peacefully and avoid disputes. I pray for this."</p>
<h3>Retrial of the Chen Tingsheng Murder Case; Four Criminals Confess to Being Instigated by Tao Boqing; Chen Said He Was Afraid of Being Killed If He Didn't Kill Him</h3>
<p>Chen Tingsheng (aka Chen Sanzi), a gangster, was shot and stabbed to death in his residence at No. 39, Haig Lane, Haig Road, on the morning of March 20th of this year. After the case occurred, Chen's concubine, Cao Ali (16 years old), came forward to report that her husband was murdered by his first wife, Chen Wangshi (30 years old, also known as Wang Guizhen, the younger sister of Wang Xinda, a gangster from Fahua Town), in collusion with her lover, Tao Boqing (a member of the Hongbang gang), who</p>
<p>hired assassins.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the French Concession police successively arrested the adulterous woman Chen Wangshi, her lover Tao Boqing, the criminals Xing Ali, Wang Susheng, Cao Jinfa, Shen Xingfa, and the bandits Wu Agou, Yu Fugen, Zhu Miaoxiang, and Xu Yougen, and seized weapons such as handguns. They were jointly handed over to the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The two defendants, Chen Wangshi and Tao Boqing, were prosecuted for inciting murder. The four criminals, Xing Ali, Cao Jinfa, Wang Susheng, and Shen Xingfa, were prosecuted for</p>
<p>committing murder.</p>
<p>The five defendants, Shen Xingfa, Xu Yougen, Zhu Miaoxiang, Yu Fugen, and Wu Agou, were prosecuted for jointly committing robbery. After Judge Liao Tan's trial last month, the case of robbery committed by Shen Xingfa et al. occurred on Hongqiao Road and other places, so it was ordered that the defendants be returned to custody, pending submission to the Supreme Court for designation of jurisdiction. Now that the Supreme Court has designated the case to be heard by the Second Special Court, the Second Special Court sent Judge Sun Pengxian to open Criminal Division One yesterday afternoon for a</p>
<p>new trial.</p>
<p>The criminal Wang Liansheng confessed to firing the gun and wielding the knife. Shen Xingfa confessed to climbing the building to help Wang Liansheng commit the murder. Cao Jinfa and Na Ali also confessed to going to commit the murder together, but all claimed to have been instructed by Tao Boqing, who promised to pay a reward of 400 yuan after the matter was completed. According to Tao Boqing, Chen Tingsheng mistakenly believed that he and Chen Wangshi were having an affair. If he did not act first, he was afraid that Chen would kill him. According to Chen Wangshi, she</p>
<p>denied her involvement, claiming</p>
<p>that she lent 100 yuan to Tao Boqing as gambling money and did not order Tao to hire someone to kill her husband. The court briefly questioned the robbers Xu Yougen et al. and then announced an adjournment, pending investigation and further questioning. The defendants were all returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Gaoqiao Situation Very Serious; Guerrillas Approaching; Japanese Aircraft Reconnoitered Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gaoqiao and San Yigang in Pudong are located opposite Wusongkou. Guerrillas active in the Baoshan County area, led by Captain Tian, have been crossing the river one after another, gathering along the coast of Pudong. They have established contact with Zhang Huifang's guerrilla unit and are jointly controlling the coast with guerrillas from Baoshan County. Japanese troops are unfamiliar with the terrain and dare not venture deep inland, but the active area of the guerrillas is only one kilometer away from the Gaoqiao pier. At the same time, after Chen Guanfu, the head of the Gaoqiao puppet army, was arrested for attempting a mutiny, the Japanese side realized the instability of the miscellaneous troops. Therefore, the puppet police station in Gaoqiao Town has built defensive fortifications, separating the puppet army from the urban area after nightfall, and ordering the puppet army sentries to retreat three miles beyond the town. In addition, Japanese troops from Gao Miao have been dispatched to Donggou and Gaoxing to maintain vigilance, taking a monitoring stance. Two Japanese aircraft flew from Wusong yesterday morning, surveying the situation along the coast, and the situation is very serious.</p>
<h3>Pudong Rumors Abound, Japanese Troops Enforce Martial Law in Datuan, Zhoupuzhen is Peaceful</h3>
<p>Rumors have been rife in Pudong recently, claiming that scorched earth tactics will be implemented, burning down towns and cities for thorough warfare. Although merchants and civilians do not believe it, people are uneasy. The Japanese army is also quite alarmed, recently observing that the Datuan town in Pudong has been attacked by guerrillas at night for several days. Due to insufficient troop strength in the area, it is difficult to cope with the situation. Therefore, yesterday, the Japanese troops originally stationed near Dongchang Road in Pudong transferred more than two hundred soldiers to Datuan for reinforcement. It is also reported that barbed wire and sentry posts have been set up at the northern and southern ends of the town and on major roads. Martial law is enforced starting at 6:00 PM every day, and pedestrians disappear. As for the rumor that guerrillas attacked Zhoupuzhen, there were only gunshots in the suburbs at the time. The Japanese army failed to effectively resist, and the guerrillas soon withdrew, and the town remained peaceful.</p>

<h3>Coal Market: Trade Resumes, Forex Market Eases, Buyers Purchase in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Due to the recent tightening of foreign exchange in the black market, the coal market in this city saw a sharp rise in the price of all goods. Buyers were waiting and watching, and market transactions came to a standstill. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited a leader in the coal industry yesterday and learned that the price fluctuations of various goods in the market are determined by the foreign exchange market. Yesterday, the black market foreign exchange market eased again, and the prices of various goods in the coal market have fallen back. Market transactions have resumed, and buyers are negotiating prices and purchasing goods in large quantities. However, few people are interested in Japanese coal.</p>
<h3>Tianjin White Russians Assist Tyranny, Abuse Compatriots with Impunity, Russian Emigrants Return to Shanghai and Describe Their Suffering</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," a White Russian residing in Shanghai, aged 29, returned to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday (the 8th). He recounted the abuse he suffered in Tianjin at the hands of the White Russian political party "Anti-Communist Party," which is protected by the Japanese. He was imprisoned for 83 days, tortured and kicked for several days, and suffered unbearable hunger. Eventually, he received food, but it was often dirty and inedible. The White Russian refused to reveal his name, fearing that his parents, who still live in Tianjin, would suffer misfortune. However, he removed his shirt to prove the suffering he endured. In addition to the adhesive bandages and gauze on his body, which covered wounds caused by heavy sticks, there were several other scars.</p>

<h3>"Puppet Consolidated Tax Bureau" Obstructs Export of Domestic Cigarettes, Deliberately Delays Inspection Procedures, Conspires to Suppress Sales of Domestic Cigarettes to the Interior</h3>
<p>There are no fewer than three or four hundred cigarette and cigar factories in this port. In the past, the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to supervise production and encourage exports, which led to rapid progress in the business of each factory. Since the Battle of Shanghai, each factory has barely survived and struggled to maintain the status quo. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side attempted to control the economy of all industries. In addition to establishing the "Puppet Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Consolidated Tax Bureau" to levy heavy taxes, they have a special desire for each cigarette factory. Yesterday, it was learned that the puppet "Consolidated Tax Bureau" has dispatched so-called "resident personnel" and "investigators" to each factory. Instigated by the Japanese side, they are invisibly implementing a so-called "export inspection" procedure, implementing a "suppress export" conspiracy, and deliberately delaying inspection procedures. Once the inspection is delayed, they threaten to stop export, preventing domestic goods from being sold to the interior, so that they can take the opportunity to dump Japanese goods and counterfeit cigarettes.</p>

<h3>Under Double Buying Spree in Finance, Cash Reaches Unprecedented High Price</h3>
<p>4,190 Yuan, Up a Total of 550 Yuan in 5 Days…</p>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the cash gold market was initially sluggish, then surged to unprecedented heights. In the beginning, it was heard that non-professionals in the foreign exchange market were willing to sell, so securities firms and others intended to sell, and the price opened at 4,000 yuan, dropping to a low of 3,980 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop aggressively bought on behalf of Hong Kong firms, and it was rumored that a certain bank was buying on behalf of a wealthy overseas Chinese individual. In addition, securities firms also turned from sellers to buyers, and at that time, the foreign exchange rate was tight, so the willingness of sellers was very low. As a result, the price soared, reaching a high of 4,150 yuan. At noon, it slightly retraced, closing at 4,110 yuan. In the afternoon, because general non-professionals believed that the trend was upward, considering the closing price of British gold at noon was 4,740.06 yuan and the closing price of the US dollar was 4,802.06 yuan, and that the future of foreign exchange was still expected to tighten, they had strong appetites. In addition, a certain bank continued to search for gold on behalf of clients, causing the market to open up to 4,160 yuan. After the opening, there were very few sellers, and the price soared to 4,190 yuan, an unprecedented peak. Before the evening closing, gold shops sold at high prices to lock in profits, and the surge was immediately curbed, eventually closing at 4,150 yuan, another 142 yuan higher than the previous day. The situation in the middle was still extremely chaotic. In short, people were panicked, with everyone buying and sellers difficult to find. Trading was brisk, at 1,200 to 1,300 taels. Jewelry gold rose by 15 yuan accordingly, reaching a new high of 420 yuan, the highest price since the market existed. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold, etc., presented a rigid state.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Rose Another 142 Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, the initial price per bar (ten taels) opened lower by 8 yuan due to the stable but tired sentiment after hearing that the foreign exchange rate was quite flat. A gold shop sold ten taels to a money exchange firm at a price of 4,000 yuan. Then it fell another 5 yuan. A cash gold firm sold ten taels to a money exchange firm at a price of 3,995 yuan. Later, it fell another 15 yuan. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,980 yuan, the low of the day. Later, a certain gold shop's aggressive absorption turned the market upward, immediately returning to above the 4,000 yuan level. A certain gold shop bought 60 taels from fellow firms at prices of 4,005 yuan and 4,010 yuan. At that time, a certain bank also started buying, aggressively buying more than 100 taels, and when the opening foreign exchange rate weakened, it soared by more than 20 yuan. A certain bank bought ten taels from a money exchange firm at a price of 4,035 yuan. After that, it once retraced slightly by 20 yuan. A cash gold firm sold ten taels to a money exchange firm at a price of 4,015 yuan, but soon after, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate continued to tighten, and a certain bank fiercely advanced again, and the securities firms also bought more than they sold. Cash gold firms and gold shops all stagnated, so the surge became intense, soaring by 135 yuan. A certain bank bought 50 taels from gold shops at a price of 4,150 yuan. It was already noon at this time. Later, because the buyer stopped advancing, it fell back by 40 yuan. The cash gold firm sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm for 4,110 yuan, which served as the noon closing price. It was heard that a certain bank bought dozens of taels more after closing, at a price of 4,120 yuan. In the afternoon, because a certain bank continued to advance fiercely, and money exchange firms also had appetites, the opening immediately rose by 50 yuan. A money exchange firm bought 30 taels from a gold shop at a price of 4,160 yuan. After opening, the buying interest was still strong, and the price rose another 30 yuan. A certain bank bought 20 taels from a money exchange firm, reaching an unprecedented shocking peak of 4,190 yuan. At that time, there were many sellers at the 4,200 yuan limit price, and cash gold firms and gold shops came to sell, so it retraced by 50 yuan. Gold shops mutually traded 20 taels at a price of 4,140 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop came to absorb it slightly, and it rebounded by 25 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 20 taels from a money exchange firm at a price of 4,165 yuan. Finally, gold shops mutually traded 20 taels for 4,150 yuan, which served as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose another 142 yuan compared to the previous day. It has been rising for five consecutive days, for a total of 550 yuan. The daily range was 210 yuan. The gold price quoted by cash gold firms was also 10 yuan higher than cash gold. The premium for cash gold was about 50 yuan lower than the quoted gold price. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Hung High at 420 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial price for jewelry gold sold by gold shops was still 405 yuan at major firms. When it reached 11:00, it rose by 5 yuan, and at 12:00 it rose another 5 yuan. At 2:00 in the afternoon, it rose another 5 yuan. After that, there were no changes. Major firms changed the price to 420 yuan, and new firms to 418 yuan.</p>
<h3>British and American Exchange Supply Cannot Meet Demand Due to Purchases by Japanese and Hong Kong Merchants</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation was that the HSBC posted rate remained unchanged. In the dark market for British and American exchange, the market was initially stable because non-professionals were still willing to sell. Later, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of China aggressively bought, and speculators from Hong Kong also frequently wired in orders. In addition, HSBC bought more than it sold. It was heard that it had absorbed 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of British gold from a certain overseas Chinese bank. Although many old bulls took profits and exited, the demand still exceeded the supply. As a result, the market steadily tightened, and by the noon closing, the unprecedentedly tight new prices of 3 pence 75 for British gold and 7.3125 yuan for the US dollar were created (similar to HSBC's posted rates). The forward prices for this month also tightened accordingly, and the actual arbitrage rate (excluding commissions) for the current 7-8 month swap was only 2.7% (calculated on a 22-day basis). Trading was still strong for half a day. As for the selling price of Hong Kong exchange, it also narrowed to 26.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Steadily Tightening</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bars had a recent term of 0.0625 higher and a distant term of 0.125 higher. The New York silver price was stable, and London's raw gold was still flat. The exchange rate for British vs. US and vs. French were flat, and vs. Shanghai was down 0.15 yuan. The US vs. British and vs. French had no change, and vs. Shanghai was down 0.25 yuan. The central posted rates for various exchanges remained the same. The banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning of 3 pence 875 for British gold and 7.5625 yuan for the US dollar, with no change from the previous close. After opening, foreign firms first settled Makali's British gold for this month at 3 pence 75, then bought spot British gold from non-professionals at 3 pence 8125, and spot US dollars at 7.5 yuan. Then, when HSBC's posted rate was announced to be unchanged and the silver balancing tax was announced to remain exempt, the Bank of China's buying intent was eager, and speculators from Hong Kong also wired in purchase orders. In addition, the Bank of Japan's absorption was also strong, and the supply from foreign firms was not smooth, so the market immediately tightened. The Bank of Japan, the Bank of China, and Hong Kong electric companies successively settled spot British gold from Huabi at 3 pence 78125, and spot US dollars at 7.375 yuan. Near noon, foreign firms settled a small amount of spot British gold from HSBC at only 3 pence 75. At that time, it was heard that the selling price of Hong Kong exchange from non-professionals also narrowed to 26.25 yuan. Until the noon closing, the banks' spot selling prices were 3 pence 75 for British gold and 7.3125 yuan for the US dollar. British gold for this month was 3 pence 65625, and the US dollar was 7.125 yuan, all unprecedentedly high prices. As a result, spot British exchange tightened by 0.125 and the US dollar narrowed by 0.25 compared to the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

The "Joint Note" dark market was down by 0.5 yuan to 101.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Retraces Slightly by 5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange bill discount rate fluctuated lower, once retreating within 200 yuan per thousand yuan. The initial rate was around 205 yuan, with a maximum of 210 yuan, then suddenly dropping to 195 yuan, soon gradually rising to 203 yuan at noon, and remaining at 205 yuan throughout the afternoon, 5 yuan lower than the previous day. The money exchange association's call loan rate also tended to stagnate, opening at 0.18 for both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Large Bars Continue to Rise, Indian Silver Calm</h3>
<p>London, 8th. Silver market short covering, Indian imports and exports uncertain, US merchants selling, the market is very flat.

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Maintains Balance, Waiting to See the Strength of Both Sides</h3>
<p>The situation in the securities dark market yesterday still showed no sign of recovery. The number of pledged loans being sold off has come to an end, while the shorts on the counter took the opportunity to fuel the fire, trying to create a sense of terror. Those who did not know the truth were fooled, believing that it had to do with the high gold price and tight exchange rates. In fact, the counter is narrow, and black market trading does not prevent or defend against rules, so it is easily exploited by small groups. After this type of manipulation was leaked, the wise all stopped, and the market became even tighter. The opening slightly covered shorts yesterday, with Class C rising to 40 yuan and Class E also rising past the 40 yuan mark. However, the counter was still acting as a defensive gate, and arbitrarily pushed down the prices of customer goods, and the price retreated into a 40 yuan trading situation. There were many scattered buyers and few concentrated sellers. The sellers started with Runli, followed by Yuankang Shunheng and No. 49. The buyers were led by Songmao, followed by Daqing Chengkang Hengfu Lianyi. Retail investors also slightly covered shorts. As a result, the market prices fluctuated between 0.1 and 0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Commercial Press stock were traded at a price of 67.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning showed no major fluctuations in prices due to no major changes in foreign exchange and the political situation.</p>
<p>London British Merchants Far East Companies Stock Market Prices on August 8th (Tuesday): HSBC Bank London registered shares rose by half a share, price 74.5 pounds, Hong Kong registered shares rose by 1 pound, price 77 pounds.

<h3>US Dollar Breaks 100 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency situation was that due to the weakening of the foreign exchange rate and the sharp rise in cash gold, British and American gold pounds were firm and sharply increased. The British gold pound was 98 yuan, and the US gold pound was 101.5 yuan. British and American gold bills were in high demand and rose sharply. Hong Kong bills and French franc bills both tended to be firm. Singapore bills, Dutch bills, etc. were all in strong demand and prices were expensive. The supply and demand for Japanese gold bills were equivalent, and the evening price was still 1.09 yuan. Korean bills were firm, and the evening price was 0.915 yuan. There were few transactions at the association. Yesterday's market prices were that British and American gold pounds both rose by 2.5 yuan, British gold bills rose by 2 yuan, American gold bills rose by 0.4 yuan, Hong Kong bills rose by 0.1 yuan, French franc bills rose by 0.01 yuan, Singapore bills and Dutch bills both rose by 0.1 yuan, Annam bills and Philippine bills both rose by 0.1 yuan, Canadian bills rose by 0.3 yuan, Australian gold bills rose by 2 yuan, and the rest of the currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Guangdong Firms Loosen Prices to Collect, Double Horse Yarn Made to 700 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise. Although the situation is fierce, it only applies to 20-count Double Horse brand, with a sign of yarn shortage. The trend of other brands of cotton yarn is very gentle. Upon investigation of why Double Horse is rising so uniquely, it is due to the fact that 20-count Special Jincheng yarn has already soared to 690 yuan to 700 yuan. In the past, the ratio of market prices between Double Horse and Jincheng yarn was always between 5 yuan and 10 yuan apart. Recently, it has been necessary to separate hundreds of yuan. As for the sales volume, it is also in the same position. However, Jincheng has come out with high prices, and it is particularly difficult to purchase spot goods. Therefore, Hong Kong firms are loosening prices on Double Horse, people's hearts are excited, and general speculators and financial circles are fanning the flames, so the surge is unexpected. However, this situation is a new record in the history of the yarn industry.</p>
<p>Spot yarn jumped wildly by 10 yuan to 20 yuan in the early morning. The price of Double Horse foreign warehouse goods was 670 yuan to 680 yuan. The price of warehouse receipts was more peaceful, at 629 yuan to 641 yuan. Soon, the market spread the word that foreign exchange had shrunk and the buying spree was pervasive. General callers were as if drunk or dreaming. In an instant, 20-count Double Horse Guangdong firms also raised prices to absorb, making it to 700 yuan, and the price of warehouse receipts was 647 yuan. Then, the momentum of the surge was inevitably too sharp, causing those who made profits to sell, and it retraced by more than 10 yuan at the close. Upon investigation, 1,365 bales were traded in half a day, and 755 bales were traded after the morning. Double Horse rose 35 yuan, Special Jincheng only rose 5 yuan, Shepherd rose 10 yuan, and other new brand yarns rose 5 yuan. Today, 870 pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Hong Kong, and 200 pieces were transported to Haiphong. The amount of each company's purchase is listed on the left: Hong Kong 750, Tianjin 95, Peers 520, Total 1,365</p>
<p>The opening of the Japanese yarn market was still peaceful, but later, it was heard that the Chinese yarn market was surging, and the market price followed. The price of 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month was 498 yuan, retracing slightly to 495 yuan. In less than an instant, it rose past the 500 yuan mark to 502 yuan.</p>
<h3>Factory Side Has Plans to Reduce Work, Cotton Prices Loosen, Peers Begin to Order American Cotton</h3>
<p>The transaction of native cotton has turned quiet, but peers have begun to purchase American Lumite Ling. This raw material is enough to spin 22-23 count yarn, but the variety and silk are very different. If the quality is superior, it can be used to make single yarn with plenty to spare, so the selling price is also different. As for the Indian cotton transaction, it is very cold. Most of the spot goods have been sold out, and the source of northern Jiangsu has also decreased. The wharf has 40 bales arriving from Tongzhou. The current situation of spot cotton is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Another piece of news: In Shanghai foreign exchange transactions, various peer firms have heard that the factory side will have plans to reduce work, so cotton selling prices have loosened. Transactions between peers are still quite lively. Although yarn prices have soared in recent days, but raw cotton prices have risen sharply. Except for Yong'an's Jincheng and Shenjiu's Double Horse, which can still obtain meager profits, the cost of products from other factories is higher than the selling price, especially the new brand yarn of small factories. Therefore, they all bitterly complain to the heavens, so most factory sides have plans to reduce work. The cotton market price, the New York cotton market, was very peaceful in the early morning. The government cotton production report was 11,412,000 bales, which was 130,000 bales less than the anticipated amount yesterday, so the market price rose. However, the news from Liverpool and Mumbai falling prices canceled out the good news, causing speculators to sell and bulls to take profits, and it was reported that the long-drought Texas had rain yesterday, so the market price went down. As a result, it fell 15 pounds compared to the previous day, India fell 2 rupees including prediction, and Egypt rose 6 pounds.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Production Amount - Government Report</h3>
<p>576,000 Bales Less Than Last Year - Washington (August 8th) The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that the first cotton harvest for this year is 11,412,000 bales, 576,000 bales less than the same period last year. The estimated situation for the same period in the past five years is recorded on the left (unit: thousand bales)</p>
<h3>Grain: No Official Rice Market, Transactions Difficult and Inactive, Only Black Market, Price Limits Have Reached the Point of Existing in Name Only</h3>
<p>The source of native rice turned slightly more yesterday, with an estimated 14 boats arriving from He Xia and Songjiang, totaling more than 4,000 ancestral units, and over 1,000 packs of Che Lun Baozi. Rice merchants, accustomed to black market transactions, are still unwilling to show samples. Those that are openly traded are those not subject to price limits, such as Dongshuang opening at 24.3 yuan, Bianyuan at 25.5 yuan, and rough Geng at 22 yuan. The real buying and selling, on the other hand, is outside the market. Although there is no official market price, rice vendors are holding out for high prices. It is rumored that Gao Hou Geng is being offered at 26 yuan, thin Dao and early and late Dao are being offered at 14 to 15 yuan, Gao Jian is being offered at 22 yuan, Zhong Jue is also wanting 20 yuan, and Po Jian is being offered at 18 yuan. Because it is a black market, it is difficult to confirm whether it is credible or just propaganda. If it is true, it will rise by another yuan compared to the previous black market. It is estimated that the number of transactions inside and outside the market is no less than 7,000 to 8,000 Dan. In the past two days, rice trucks were commonly seen in front of rice shops in the two concessions, indicating that more goods have arrived. Now the price limits exist in name only, the rice market is a formality, and the black market is very developed. According to the current situation, this strange phenomenon should not exist, and it damages the credibility of the price limits, which is not appropriate. It is thought that the concession authorities must have a way to improve the situation.</p>
<p>The lifting of the guest enamel ban has been rumored for a long time, but it has not yet been realized. Yesterday, storekeepers in this street competed to handle it, and each enamel was again increased by 0.7 to 1 yuan, and special top goods were still not easy to find. The general market for Gao Jing Xian also reached 21.5 yuan. The goods side does not want to completely sell the less than 70,000 bales in stock. Throughout the day, less than 2,000 packs were openly traded.</p>
<p>The demand for foreign rice imports is very greedy. New Saigon is being offered at 28 yuan, but no one is willing to sell. It is rumored that foreign countries are pulling it to 33 to 34 yuan, and it is difficult to pass the customs. However, rice merchants are suggesting that they request six offices to settle foreign exchange, and the Shanghai authorities should come forward to apply, and the rice payment will be shared by the rice industry, and the losses from selling at a loss at the limited price will also be borne by both parties. How this matter will evolve will be proven by the facts.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Strangely Brisk, Customer Orders Not Accepted, Wheat Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Wheat flour is selling very briskly yesterday, mainly because foreign exchange rates have continued to decline in recent days, the gold market has soared, and wheat prices have skyrocketed. The cost of flour is increasing daily. The price of No. 2 flour from the factory has reached five yuan and fifty cents in cash. Local dealers have not been able to immediately increase prices. Therefore, factories, in addition to supplying the daily retail needs of local dealers, are restricting large-scale customer hoarding and those with slightly larger demands. As a result, formal customer orders have virtually stalled. The total market turnover is only about 12,000 bags. Some returned goods have been sold, with prices comparable to factory prices. According to factory sources, flour prices may need to rise again.</p>
<p>The wheat market saw relentless price increases yesterday. Since the end of last month, when flour mills officially began purchasing new wheat, grain prices have soared and financial markets have undergone changes. The upward trend has continued unabated. Prices have risen by more than one yuan in just ten days. Yesterday, both Chinese and Japanese mills added to their purchases, and hoarders have also been actively buying. The total market turnover was more than 30 cartloads, with Chinese mills purchasing over 10 cartloads, and hoarders and Japanese mills jointly purchasing 20 cartloads. The highest price has reached eight yuan and thirty cents, while the average price is also around seven yuan and seventy or eighty cents. Market prices have risen by another ten to twenty cents.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Some Cloth Returns to the Market, 1,000 Pieces of East India Fine Cloth Released</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>The situation has stabilized, and opening prices are moderate. Due to high market prices and tight credit, some dealers and hoarders are taking advantage of high prices to sell off their holdings. Therefore, new buying interest has weakened. Local wholesale dealers are specifically seeking bleached and finished goods to hoard. Jardine Matheson's "Deer" twill flannel, 16-pound, is priced at 20 yuan in cash, and 13-pound at 18 yuan and 50 cents in cash, with 37 cases sold. Jardine Matheson's "Three Pagodas," "First Bloom," and other brands of bleached cloth, Hongzhang and other factory-made line flannel and serge, and Guangzhong tribute cloth, have seen over 100 cases sold. Outside hoarders have purchased over 100 bales of Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth, Fugu fine cloth, fine twill, and other goods. Customer sales are weak, and some original orders at lower prices are awaiting shipment, with a wait-and-see attitude towards new goods. Hong Kong and Southeast Asian buyers are demanding strict price limits, only purchasing 40 to 50 pieces of 11-pound "Three Deer" coarse cloth and miscellaneous fine twill. Over 1,000 bolts of bleached cloth, dyed twill, and red foreign-labeled goods.</p>
<p>East India Cloth</p>
<p>White cloth rose in the morning but stabilized in the afternoon, with the upward trend still strong. September futures for 2-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at a high price, with sales reaching 20 yuan per bolt, 19 yuan and 50 cents for the current month, and 19 yuan for spot goods, an increase of 50 cents to one yuan. However, in the afternoon, dealers sold off their holdings for profit, with prices slightly retreating by 10 cents or so per bolt. Buyers from the northern routes of Yantai, Qingdao, and Qinhuangdao purchased over 700 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Local dealers only added 100 to 200 pieces. Trading houses such as Ito and Toyo Cotton have taken advantage of high prices to place orders for over 1,000 pieces of future and spot fine cloth and fine twill. "Dragon Head" fine cloth is priced at 19 yuan and 50 cents for the current month, 19 yuan and 75 cents to 20 yuan for next month, "Flying Fish" at 18 yuan and 50 cents, "Double Dragon Pearl" at 17 yuan and 50 cents. Yesterday, colored "Four Gentlemen" serge was sold at 55 cents per yard.</p>
<h3>Grains: June White Soybeans from Hankou Enter the Market - Opening Price at Eleven Yuan</h3>
<p>In previous years, new yellow soybeans from Hankou, known as "June White," were the earliest to enter the market. However, this year, due to extraordinary circumstances, the arrival of these goods has been delayed by more than a month. Yesterday, the first shipment of over 500 bags was transported by Japanese merchants. The quality is still good, but due to uneven weather conditions, there are many shriveled beans. The opening price is eleven yuan, with over 400 bags sold, all distributed by local dealers. It is said that the cost of transporting these beans to Shanghai is only about eight yuan, but it is not accessible to outsiders. It is feared that the restrictions in Hankou are not permanent, and subsequent shipments may not be able to connect. Other soybeans have increased by another thirty to forty cents. Wuhu beans are selling at 300 bags for eleven yuan and thirty cents, Huaian beans at 140 bags for ten yuan and five cents and two cents, Changzhou cowhide yellow beans at 180 bags for ten yuan and six cents, and Hankou [unclear] beans at 200 bags for ten yuan and nine cents and a half. Dalian beans show a mediocre trend, with the opening price at eleven yuan and fifty cents for the original shipment, with one cartload sold. The sales market for all beans is still limited to local dealers.</p>
<p>100 bags of beans and 435 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong on the tenth. 2,000 cans of tung oil arrived from Tianjin and 1,280 pieces of green oil came from Ningbo, imported on the ninth.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Prices Receive Double Boost, New York Futures and Spot Prices Diverge</h3>
<p>The local silk market saw a further decline in foreign exchange rates yesterday, and New York's near-term prices suddenly rose by five cents. Benefiting from this double boost, prices soared. White factory sales were firm, but not very uniform. RR sales opened at 3350 yuan to 3400 yuan yesterday, with Xinfu and Dachang making small transactions. Shanghai manufacturers are holding prices firmly and are generally unwilling to sell. Sales of silk waste to India and Africa are gradually expanding, but due to the large amount of inventory in that port, prices have not been able to rise in proportion to the exchange rate. Yesterday, sales to British, American, Indian, and African markets totaled over 30 bundles.</p>
<p>In the international silk market, the prices of futures and spot markets have recently been inconsistent, and even diverging. Yesterday, New York's near-term prices rose by five cents, while far-term prices rose by one cent. Conversely, spot prices fell by one cent. Lyon's raw silk fell by 3.50 francs, and Shanghai silk B fell by one franc. Yokohama's spot prices rose by ten yuan, and futures prices rose by five yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Imported Sugar Recovers Slightly</h3>
<p>According to London telegrams, the sugar market saw little change yesterday. Near-term December futures were at a small halfpenny, at 5 shillings and 11 pence, March of next year at 6 shillings, and June at 6 shillings and 0.75. The local association's set prices are 24 for crude white small triangles, 34 yuan and 10 cents for local warehouses, 34 yuan for external warehouses, 25 yuan and 80 cents for transshipment goods, a small 20 cents, Taikoo car white small 45 cents, East Warehouse B Mark 39 yuan, CW 38 yuan and 80 cents, CX 38 yuan and a half, DY 38 yuan, West Warehouse 38 yuan and 20 cents, HX wheat 38 yuan.

<h3>The Bee-Type Essay</h3>
<p>— Chen Youqin</p>
<p>A Roman poet once left behind a famous saying: "If the genre of epigram is to be written well, it should have the three qualities that bees possess: 1. a sting, 2. honey, 3. a small body."</p>
<p>Today, not only epigrams should have the three qualities mentioned by the Roman poet, but with life becoming increasingly complex and time becoming more precious, people's lives are tense, so tense that they no longer have the leisure to read novels on the sofa. Editors of newspaper supplements repeatedly remind contributors, "Submissions should be short and concise, not exceeding 1,000 words." Even magazine editors need short articles of 3,000 to 5,000 words or less. Anything longer would be inconvenient for both editors and readers to publish serially. The popularity of a "small body" is not an exceptional stroke of luck but a demand of the times. Moreover, during the war of resistance, paper is too expensive, and short articles save paper, which is more in line with economic conditions.</p>
<p>The first is the sting. A work without a sting suffers from softness and bonelessness, and its attitude is inevitably obsequious and detestable. If all 300 poems in the Book of Odes had "beauty" but no "sting," they would have been thrown into the latrine long ago. How could they have survived to this day? Essays such as maxims and inscriptions have the greatest task of stinging people, which is even more obvious. The bee's sting is its weapon to defend itself, but without a sting, it cannot work leisurely and cannot add extra nutrients to human beings.</p>
<p>The second is honey. Who doesn't love to eat honey? This is the same as everyone loving to read good literary works. Bees painstakingly produce honey, only to have people take it all away and even criticize it for not being sweet, fragrant, or delicious. In fact, they themselves cannot make honey and are irresponsible. It doesn't help the bees to compliment it if it tastes good.</p>
<p>For whom do bees toil and for whom do they busy themselves? It's just because it is in their nature. Making honey and working is their duty. Writers, like bees, should also work for others and for society.</p>
<p>Beekeepers tell me that bees must thrive in places where flowers and trees are abundant in order to produce good works and give beekeepers extremely large harvests.</p>
<p>Today, for those engaged in literature, where are the places where flowers and trees are abundant? It is only natural that good honey cannot be produced without a large amount of pollen. (This is especially true for writers living in the interior, who cannot buy new and good books and newspapers, just like bees cannot collect pollen.)</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago, Mr. Ye Shaojun wrote an essay called "Beekeeping," in which he satirized new entrepreneurs who raised Italian bees but did not immediately implement honey collection, making beekeeping an empty business. This is like some friends who are ambitious but impractical, who only criticize the articles in a certain supplement as bad, the articles in a certain magazine as too bad, and even say they are worthless. As a result, they themselves cannot produce a little bit of good honey for others to taste.</p>
<p>The author of a piece of writing with a sting, honey, and a small body has the same fate as the "laborious but thankless" bee.</p>
<h3>German Labor Concentration Camps (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Mou Zhou</p>
<p>Nine hundred prisoners were employed in digging up the marshland near Istorwöhe, digging it to a depth of two or three yards. Stormtroopers, disguised as officials from the agricultural labor department, were also there, watching to see if anyone straightened their backs. Two guards checked the work done by each prisoner and punished those who were allegedly lazy. In the punishments they devised, the guards showed their peculiar sense of humor: they ordered prisoners to stand on their toes facing the sun, to jump over ditches that were too wide to jump over, causing them to fall in. On the edges of the drainage ditches, they forced prisoners to perform a series of bizarre movements. If the prisoner did not fall into the ditch himself, the guards would push him in.</p>
<p>Regardless of the prisoner's age, strength, or physical condition, everyone was assigned the same amount of work. The work was calculated based on the area of land dug. However, sometimes the topsoil only covered a thin layer of swamp, while in other places the swamp was three or four yards deep. Sometimes, the swamp also contained buried tree trunks that had to be dug up. However, the guards did not bother themselves with these minor details. The unfortunate prisoner who did not complete the work assigned to him was sent to work in the "surveillance unit."</p>
<p>For weak prisoners unaccustomed to outdoor life, the hard work of the first few days was terrible. But after a while, the instinct for survival prevailed. The prisoners gradually got used to it. In the first few weeks, almost every prisoner had hands that were a bloody mess, with the handles of the tools stained with blood.</p>
<p>However, the most terrible thing was the "surveillance unit," which was where most of the massacres took place. Anyone sentenced to more than five years was assigned to the unit. The harsh sentences handed down by the German authorities to political prisoners meant that the "surveillance unit" never lacked a large number of political prisoners. All work there had to be completed at a high speed. From January 1938 to April 15 of the same year, countless prisoners were shot in the "surveillance unit" at Istorwöhe.</p>
<p>A special group within the "surveillance unit" was the "waste transport group," which had to clear the waste from the toilets, load it onto carts with a capacity of 200 liters, and transport it to newly dug areas. Eight prisoners pushed each cart. Those assigned to this job were prisoners who had requested medical treatment but were deemed to be faking illness by the doctors. Anyone whose temperature did not reach 101 degrees Fahrenheit was immediately considered to be faking illness when they approached the doctor. This led to the following incident: Marx Pirsch, who was suffering from a severe kidney disease, was assigned to the "waste transport group." Driven to despair, he asked Michalis, the guard supervising the group, to shoot him. "Of course, everything you do is to try to escape," the latter replied. Pirsch turned around, hesitated, and before he had gone five yards, a shot had already been fired. "Shot while trying to escape," the guard reported to his superiors. There was not even a report of this in the newspaper.</p>
<p>A few days after Pirsch's death, another massacre occurred: a prisoner in the "surveillance unit" was randomly selected by the guards and designated as an escapee. As punishment, the guards ordered him to run continuously from one guard post to another. One guard mockingly prevented him from running to the second guard, only allowing him to run in another direction. Suddenly, the machine gun on the observation tower began to chatter, and another life was lost.</p>
<p>Most of the criminal concentration camps were located only three miles from the Dutch border, and prisoners often worked right on the border. However, security was very tight, so it was rare for prisoners to escape. The first project completed in that area a few years ago was the construction of a road along the border. Observation towers were set up along the road, and there were constant patrols. As soon as a prisoner was discovered to be missing, the entire border patrol was mobilized to search.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1936, while prisoners were working between Neusustede and Oberlangen, only one hundred yards from the Dutch border, three men attempted to escape. Two were hit by bullets and fell on German soil. The third managed to cross the border but was not found by the Dutch authorities. Several months passed. The harvest season arrived. During the harvest, Dutch farmers found a rotting corpse in the grass, still wearing the prisoner's uniform. The prisoner had died of blood loss from a bullet wound to the neck.</p>
<p>These conditions drove many prisoners into the depths of despair, so they resorted to self-mutilation, sometimes cutting off a few fingers, sometimes cutting off an entire hand. For this reason, axes, which were once common in the camp, were now almost never seen. However, shovels (which had to be very sharp for digging up the marshland) could easily be used instead of axes. When the notorious Schäfer (former commander of the Oranienburg concentration camp) was transferred to command the Ems camp, he immediately announced that even disabled prisoners would still have to work in the marshland. Special tools were also designed so that even prisoners with only one hand could work in the marshland. In addition, those who attempted suicide would also be punished with three months of work in the "surveillance unit." But incidents of self-mutilation continued to increase. In August 1937 alone, twenty-four cases were recorded.</p>
<p>Despite these horrors, there were still not many political prisoners who lost their courage. They gritted their teeth and endured everything. They increased their courage with a hope: that a day of reckoning would eventually dawn. (Translated from Magazine Digest)</p>
<h3>Seagull's Dream</h3>
<p>— Ye Xiaojia</p>
<p>A speck of white plunges straight into the waves. White spray washes white feathers, drawing a circle, turning over, and stirring up white foam all around. It should be extraordinarily clean – the feathers on its wings, the soft down on its chest and back.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it takes flight! A halo of white hangs beneath the clear blue sky. Stretching out its wings, bearing the blue sky above and overlooking the vast sea below, it closes its eyes and draws circles with the wind; listening to the gentle song and sob of the waves.</p>
<p>It closes its eyes even tighter, drawing the circles even more lightly. Thinking, dreaming of a beautiful dream. Like it is now: without the dust of the world, clamor, ash, and smoke... infinitely pure, infinitely beautiful: like a poet wearing a feathered robe and laurel wreath, chanting under the moonlit flowers.</p>
<p>"Hmm!" It laughs briskly! It must go roll in the waves again!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strange sound makes it hesitate in its flight angle. Listening carefully: it is definitely not like the high-pitched song of its kind, nor does it resemble the cries of the waves. This sound is unusual.</p>
<p>It strains its vision to search, and finally finds a small black shadow far away. It flies towards it.</p>
<p>Gradually closer, gradually larger! It is a rectangular contraption, with some high, thin strips pointing straight into the sky, riding the waves and advancing forward. The head facing the onslaught of the waves, the tail splitting the waves in two.</p>
<p>"This stupid thing dares to sail into this sacred place!" A little angry, it flies up to meet it.</p>
<p>When it reaches above the object, it plummets vertically with the speed of an arrow released from a bow!</p>
<p>"Coo! Coo!" The stupid thing roars. A wave of heat makes it tremble slightly: it quickly flies up, feeling a little sticky on its abdomen and back. The monster is shrouded in swirling black mist.</p>
<p>It looks back at itself, and the snow-white feathers are covered in black specks.</p>
<p>It flies into the sea waves, trying hard to remove and wash away the stains.</p>
<p>When it flies up again, the pure white place has been stained gray, and the black has faded a lot.</p>
<p>The shadow of the strange-sounding thing is far away and faint, gradually, gradually, disappearing.</p>
<p>Tears well up in its eyes. It thinks of its pure white feathered robe, and feels the sorrow of the dream.</p>
<p>The sea is howling! The long sky is still as blue as it was washed.</p>
<p>An old man leads a child to rest before the official's desk, recounting the sorrow of the fall and overflowing with emotion and tears.</p>
<p>— Ci Kai</p>
<h3>Farewell Grass</h3>
<p>— Lei Dafen</p>
<p>I don’t know if the sorrow of parting is a faint lamentation like light clouds, or a dreamlike melancholy?</p>
<p>It is not sending a friend off on a long journey, nor is it a separation from a loved one, but classmates who have mingled together all year round are scattering in all directions one day for the sake of traditional customs — saying they have graduated. It is not enough to make you sob sadly, cry, or slump over a desk with your shoulders shaking, but it is a slight sense of sadness; but it always entangles you and refuses to let go, like a long ribbon.</p>
<p>There is no banquet in the world that does not end, as the ancients said. What is there to be nostalgic for? Stride forward! Friends' words are even better. It's a pity that I don't have that kind of optimistic mind. An ordinary person has too many sorrows.</p>
<p>On the journey of life, we have come to a fork in the road, so we say farewell to each other.</p>
<p>"Goodbye."</p>
<p>Everyone has woven a dream for themselves, expecting surprises: to meet an old friend in a foreign land.</p>
<p>But I remember even more the path that the young people before my eyes should take. Living in an era of suffering, young people must grow in battle and throw themselves into the storm. The motherland is beckoning to us intimately: "Come! Go!"</p>
<p>Chen will soon be sailing across the sea to a far, far away place. Someone said: "Chen, you are a fortunate child." "I am very ashamed. In such an era, I really shouldn't leave my motherland," Chen said with a wry smile.</p>
<p>I recalled another friend's poem:</p>
<p>"In the distance, there is the light that you pray for day and night."</p>
<h3>Eaves Drip</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Prose</p>
<p>We are still accustomed to saying such clichés: "Life is always prose, without a line of poetry," cursing a string of ordinary, lazy, and scattered days. Perhaps yearning for a dewdrop-like novelty, perhaps longing for a wave-like turbulence and tension.</p>
<p>The days slip by quietly from sighs, from the tips of our fingers. Once we think about it, everyone says it is a loss. However, can it be recovered?</p>
<p>So people will say: Like floating clouds to me. Prose, prose, forever prose.</p>
<p>Want to be like poetry? First of all, you have to establish the rhythm of life.</p>
<h3>An Answer to a Child’s Question</h3>
<p>— S.T. Coleridge 作 Xi Jin 译</p>
<p>You ask what the little birds say? The sparrow, the dove,</p>
<p>The linnet and thrush say, “I love and I love!”</p>
<p>In the winter they’re silent – the wind is so strong;</p>
<p>What he says, I don’t know, but he sings a loud song.</p>
<p>But green leaves, and blossoms, and sunny warm weather,</p>
<p>And singing, and loving – all come back together.</p>
<p>But the lark is so brimful of gladness and love,</p>
<p>The green fields below, and the blue sky above,</p>
<p>That he sings, and he sings; and for ever sings he –</p>
<p>"I love my Love, and my Love loves me!"</p>

<h3>Performance of "Shanghai Nights"</h3>
<p>— Foam</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama Society, which had been quiet for quite some time, finally performed at the Palace Theater with a brand-new look.</p>
<p>The Drama Society, which has excellent playwrights, directors, actors, and all technical talents in the Shanghai theater scene, just as they said themselves, during their year of growth: "In order to not get a performance venue, we once set up a "do or die" formation, risked wrapping up the "Carlton" courtyard within the Lunar New Year period when Peking opera was closed; we also fought a "trench warfare," retreating to the movie cartoon venue on Sunday mornings, renting "New Light" to hold a series of twelve Sunday morning performances as an experiment."</p>
<p>If, as they themselves said, the Drama Society, which has been fighting for a year, has indeed set up a "do or die" formation and "trench warfare," then this time, the Drama Society has changed into a professional theater troupe, rented a theater, and prepared a long-term performance plan, it should be establishing a fortress and engaging in a long "positional warfare."</p>
<p>Indeed, from any perspective, the Shanghai Drama Society, which has experienced countless difficulties and hardships, has indeed become stronger and healthier in this difficult year. Therefore, the performance of the Shanghai Drama Society this time should be paid considerable respect. The repertoire for this public performance is Mr. Yu Ling's new work after "Women's Apartment" and "Tears of Flowers." In order to facilitate the performance and to rush the rehearsals, it is indeed gratifying that "Shanghai Nights" can meet us in such a short time.</p>
<p>In terms of meaning, "Shanghai Nights" should be the most realistic masterpiece. Among all of Mr. Yu Ling's works, all the materials after the war have been gathered together. When the Shanghai people who have tasted the bitterness of life see the performance of "Shanghai Nights," they should have infinite sighs.</p>
<p>Here, we see the scene of flying pancakes and fried dough sticks from the iron fences of Nanshi (the performance has been deleted); a sketch of people queuing in front of rice shops because they can't buy rice; the latest phenomenon of using stamps instead of copper coins due to a lack of them; a guy who "trades" and "does business" with small mustaches, eating bullets; also vicious and merciless landlords who are more ruthless than murderers; also the tragedy of selling a virgin because they can't pay the rent... and female students who go to the sea to dance for a living...</p>
<p>It looks like a comedy, but in fact, every picture and every material is carving out the most tragic tragedy.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Yu Ling's style and technique, I don't want to talk much about it here. However, I personally feel that although "Shanghai Nights" contains a lot of material and the facts are fresh, it is not dramatic enough. The development of the play is always very flat. It has no foreshadowing and no climax. Instead of saying that "Shanghai Nights" is a tragic tragedy, it is better to say that it is a desolate prose poem. This is just as Mr. Li Jianwu said: Mr. Yu Ling himself has a "poetic mind" and "keen perception." But if he can organize these poetic sentiments and perceptions and dramatize them, then the performance of "Shanghai Nights" will definitely gain even greater harvest.</p>
<p>Due to the limitations of the script and the deletion of some parts, the performance of "Shanghai Nights" has indeed been greatly affected.</p>
<p>With such a subject matter, I think the tone of the whole play should be faster. Perhaps because it was a benefit performance (Sunday evening show), the actors all felt unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Xu Li's Qian Kaizhi is very stable; Bai Li's Mei Qihui can strengthen the demeanor of a shy girl, and will definitely be much better; Lan Lan's Wu Ji has too little stage time, some of the scenes are quite stable, and the spicy taste can be more decisive; Vera's stepmother is indeed a very suitable actor for the role; Tang Xuanfan's Sun Huanjun has a cunning appearance and a good appearance, but his movements and lines are sometimes too slow; Wen Piao's Yun Gu is a very successful newcomer; Ye Xiaomei's Xiao Yun is very clear; Wang Xingxu's pronunciation is too low, and the movements should be more exaggerated, the depressed atmosphere is not clear enough; Mei Zhu's Qian Yi is very stable, can be more sophisticated; Ding Zhi's Feng Feng and Murong Wan'er's landlady are both good.</p>
<p>This article can only be regarded as a personal observation.</p>

<h3>"Made in China" Special Effects War of Resistance Film "Defending the Four Counties" Screening in Hong Kong Favorable Results Official Release Soon</h3>
<p>— Hui Cun</p>
<p>Since moving from Hankou to Chongqing, the China Film Studio has been actively filming the most outstanding film practitioners, actively shooting story films, and dispatching photography teams to various battlefields and behind Japanese lines to capture the heroic achievements of soldiers on the spot.</p>
<p>Recently, the story film "Defending the Homeland" has been completed and screened in Chongqing, with unprecedented success. As for newsreels, "Special Issue on the Bombing of Chongqing" and "Defending the Four Counties" have been completed one after another. In addition, there is also the filming of the song collection "May Commemoration," with a total of seven songs from May 1st to May 30th, which is quite solemn and majestic!</p>
<p>"Special Issue on the Bombing of Chongqing" not only captured the brutal scenes of Japanese planes bombing Chongqing on the spot, but also captured the brave operations of our planes and the fierce shooting of anti-aircraft guns, which made people feel indignant! Admired.</p>
<p>"Defending the Four Counties" is a newsreel about the War of Resistance in South China. The Four Counties refer to Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, and Xinhui in Guangdong. The "Made in China" authorities sent a photography team to various places in the Four Counties to capture on-the-spot footage. It took more than two months to complete it.</p>
<p>In this film, we can see the dynamics of every village in the Four Counties, which are displayed before our eyes. The compatriots of the Four Counties who miss their hometown can see the heroic resistance of their fathers and brothers in this film!</p>
<p>In every place, we can see the women and strong men practicing, and the broken walls and rubble after being bombed by Japanese planes, as well as the activities of the Pioneer Team of Children in Taishan and Kaiping.</p>
<p>In this film, we can see General Gu Dinghua, General Deng Bohan, General Yang Qianji, the first security commander of Guangdong Province, and Zhang Ping, the deputy commander of the elite troops in the Jianghui Battle, inspecting the war zone and comforting the compatriots. Here, we can also see the southern national mothers, Madam Zhou, Madam Situ, Madam Xie, etc., leading a group of women to rush to make various comfort products.</p>
<p>Finally, when we see the brave soldiers in the Jianghui Battle! waving flags and shouting, fighting for the front, we can't help but feel admiration.</p>

<h3>Chatting About the Qiantian Chamber Opera</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>— Research on Tou Shu When Shi'erdun Stole the Horse</p>
<p>Although Yan Jupeng's last day of opera was a daytime performance, Gao Shenglin and Qiu Shengrong's complete "Linked Rings" featured Qiu Shengrong as Bao Erdun, who led the horse out of the stage door when he went down the mountain to steal the horse. His performance of throwing the letter was just like Jin Shaoshan throwing the letter arbitrarily on the ground before proceeding to the stage. This point, which seems unimportant, is actually the key to the whole play. The ups and downs of the whole play after stealing the horse all originate from this letter. During the Republic of China years 2-3, I watched Huang Runfu and Yang Xiaolou Li Xinfu perform together (Huang Runfu and Xiaolou performed twice, and with Xinfu once.) Runfu's performance when stealing the horse was different from ordinary actors. When he stole the imperial horse to the center of the stage, he took the letter with one hand and looked at it with a complacent expression, then looked down at the ground to find a suitable place to throw the letter. This is an indispensable description of the expression, and it is the finishing touch of the play. If this letter cannot enter the eyes of the person, then the act of stealing the horse with all his efforts is actually meddling. Runfu's performance at this time was particularly meticulous, and the audience watched intently. Li Lianzhong can also convey Runfu's spirit. Now, people like Hao Shouchun, Jin Shaoshan, and Qiu Shengrong do not have Runfu's brilliant performance. How can this be a small matter? Once it is revealed, there must be those who think that my words are worth studying. The decline of the old opera has to be blamed on the famous actors' negligence, and those who are responsible for teaching the play should deeply consider these subtle but important points.</p>
<p>Qiu Shengrong's performance in this play is quite skillful, but it also has its excesses. It is probably because he is too eager to do well, so he inevitably overdoes it. Gao Shenglin's Huang Tianba sings and recites like Xiaolou, which is also commendable. On that day, Wang Fushan's Zhu Guangzu was absent due to illness. After the death of Wang Changlin, I thought of seeing Wang Fushan, but Fushan was never seen in the end. I can only wait for another day.</p>
<h3>Brief News from the Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Tian</p>
<p>According to reliable information: Xu Xingzhi, Shu Yan, Wu Tian, and Wu Xiaobang have all left the Sino-French Drama Society, and more than 20 students from the Sino-French Drama School have also withdrawn at the same time. The "Ideal Wife," which was originally scheduled to be staged today, has naturally "blown." As for what happens next, no one can predict.</p>
<p>The Quick News Agency reported that Yuan Muzhi and Chen Bo'er were arrested in northern Shanxi. According to news among friends, someone recently received a letter from Chen Bo'er from Chongqing. The Quick News Agency's telegram may be as inaccurate as Zhao Dan's arrest in Hankou last year.</p>
<p>For the day shows of "Shanghai Nights" yesterday and the day before yesterday, Ding Zhi played the role of Wu Ji, because Lan Lan was rushing to complete a set of scenery for "Women's Apartment" at the Yihua Company.</p>
<h3>A Swarm of Orioles Flying in Confusion</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Women in the Wind"</p>
<p>Recently, film prices have soared. Domestic film companies have suggested reducing the length of films from 10,000 feet to 7-8,000 feet. In fact, this problem is easily solved. Directors should try their best to avoid all the protracted and redundant transitional scenes. These cumbersome films not only have no benefits, but sometimes can even damage the development of the entire play. Conversely, spending an extra one or two thousand feet of film to pursue brilliance is not a loss.</p>
<p>"A Swarm of Orioles Flying in Confusion" is not the most outstanding work, but under the director's brisk handling and concise weaving, it feels that 7-8,000 feet of film is enough to cope with a movie. Therefore, I mention the above question.</p>
<p>For example, the introduction of the aviator Yas and the meeting of the male and female protagonists are very brief and lively.</p>
<p>The two sky flights before and after are also handled very compactly. When Jenny was flying the plane, Yas was so anxious that he didn't know what to do. The director described the dangerous situation of the sky flight and the critical state of everyone on the ground very cutely. Recently, before the emergency of Jenny's No. 5 plane, the accident of No. 10 plane was written first, which strengthened the tense atmosphere behind it, which is also very clever.</p>
<p>When Kaifu Gexisi's Jenny ran out of gasoline and one of the landing gear was hit and could not descend, several close-ups showed that her facial expressions were the same as usual, with no anxious performance at all, and her appearance (too fat) and age did not look like a girl.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>General Long Legs Busy Hanging and Splitting Plaques at a Party</p>
<p>On April 8th of the 13th year of the Republic of China, it was the 71st birthday of General Zhang Changtui's mother. At that time, Zhang was the commander of the First Army of the Feng Army and the commander of the bandit suppression, and a large army was stationed in Xuzhou. Although it was called an army, it actually consisted of five mixed brigades, with Cheng Guorui, Bu Yupupu, Fang Zhenwu, Fang Yongchang, and Bi Shucheng all serving as brigade commanders. At that time, after the Jiangzhe War, which had not been quelled for long, Lu Zijia, in a dejected mood, went north to Tianjin and Beijing, and went to Fengtian to meet the King outside the pass. After being appointed as a high-ranking official by the Duan government as an envoy of consolation, he was granted heavy troops by Feng Zhang. After the failure, he suddenly had such momentum, and at the same time, he was protected by General Long Legs. He set foot on Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province again, avoiding being an envoy of consolation. In fact, it was a show of force in front of the Zhili military officials Su Qiwan and Chen. Zhang Zongchang was a friend who liked to join in the fun and liked to stand up for the underdog, so he took the opportunity to celebrate his mother's birthday and made a big show of it. On the one hand, he sent people to Tianjin and Beijing to invite all the famous actors to Xuzhou to hold a grand party. On the other hand, he sent telegrams to the military and political authorities of various provinces to send representatives to Xuzhou to participate in a certain meeting. Provinces that were far away and had nothing to do with him could of course come or not. However, it seemed that the military and civilian leaders of Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu could not help but perfunctorily deal with him, because he guarded Xuzhou, which was located at the junction of the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways, and Lu Yongxiang was stationed in the city as an envoy of consolation. They could not take him too lightly. Therefore, after receiving the news, they all enthusiastically sent people to participate in the event, in order to directly please Lu and Zhang, and indirectly win the favor of Duan Zhizheng and Marshal Zhang. (At that time, the military and political power of the Beiyang government was in the hands of Duan Hefei and Zhang Zuolin. Lu was close to Duan, and Long Legs was Zhang's newly appointed army commander, so these two had close relations with Duan and Zhang.) (7-8)</p>
