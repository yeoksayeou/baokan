<p>社評</p>
<h3>英國在遠東</h3>
<p>本月十二日，英國陸軍部公告：「為軍事便利起見，英國依據一九零一年（辛丑）條約駐在中國平津間之軍隊，茲特飭令撤退其大部分；此後英國在彼處僅留足以保護英國財產及維持秩序之兵士，此項決定，業已通知駐兵華北之各國政府」。於是撒兵，法國繼之。</p>
<p>自平面觀察近日之遠東，無新變化；其實人人不能無所感覺，即凡百新變化，正在醞釀之中。自平面觀察英國之撤兵，則據二日來英國方面正式與非正式之說明，有要點凡七：（一）撒退駐軍之範圍，限於華北，而駐在中國他處之軍隊，並不撒退；（二）撒退華北駐軍之大部分，却非全部撒退；（三）為歐戰軍事上之原因而撒退，非為遠東或中國或華北有何其他原因而撒退；（四）為冬令營房設備不周而撒退；（五）為營房受水災影響，修繕須耗英金萬鎊而撒退：（六）保留駐兵權及依據辛丑條約之其他一切權利；（七）早有撒退之規劃，祗以撤之曩日，則有接受日本威脅之嫌疑，且有準備放棄華北一切權利之嫌疑，及今撤退則認為不致為世人或日人若此誤會。法國方面之說明，謂撒兵之性質與範圍，俱同英國。英法在歐戰為同盟國，茲在遠東，亦表見其所謂「政策平行」，「行動平行」。就事論事，雖英國陸軍當局發為公告，外交當局通知各國，備見鄭重其事，不同凡響；然吾人寗願深信英法關於本問題所說明之忠實；故於平面觀察之外，我人不必更予檢討；亦即不妨視為無關大局之小動作，無關宏旨之小新聞可也。雖然，在此小動作小新聞之四周，有可推論者。</p>
<p>本年五月間，英法美三國曾以同數之水兵，在鼓浪嶼登陸；當時國際論壇僉謂三國對遠東採行平行政策，爰作平行行動，此其發端，行見遠東局勢漸且淸澄。爾後事實所示，淸澄之效未覩，而平行之局旋廢。故英國單獨談判於東京，美國毅然宣布廢商約；英國陸軍部纔公告撒退華北駐軍之一部分，美國國務卿即聲明駐軍不撤，政策不變，誠以英法之環境與國勢，曁其政策之基本信念與美國逈不相若，自有其不能平行者在焉。原今日英法之所亟，端在對德，故於凡百問題，悉以所影響及於對德問題之利害為權衡中心，從而分別取舍從違。英國對華，再三聲明具有同情，維持其原來政策；然試推其意念，殆以為對華政策之維持與吾，無關對德；而對日關係之妥善與吾，則將予對德問題以嚴重之影響；是以英人在主觀上絕不「出賣中國，」而其舉措輒惟避免對日磨擦是求。更玫英國之所由搆成如此意念者：一因對德僅感制勝之必要，而必勝之信心不足以副之；故重視對德之一時戰爭。忽視其他方面悠久之得失。二因英國在海外之權利，奉物質之威力為唯一之保障；故對於他國所挾之威力，非有以防範之，即謀有以利用之；此類傳統觀念之中，每每否認深厚之感情具有最後決定之力量，因此不善培養感情，甚且不恤犧牲感情。三因英國自視過高，以為予人微笑，即是無上恩情，而不知野心者眈眈逐逐，決無饜足；餌之，適以亢進其慾求。因此三者，英國對遠東，實有其內在之徬徨；遠東戰爭方事創作近代史，而英國今日對遠東徬徨之程度乃為彼近代史中所未有也。徬徨之甚，抑且久於徬徨，所由不致退却者無他，美國未嘗挾英國以平行，然英國為對付德國計，未能與美國背道而馳。美國之遠東政策固確切不移者也。</p>
<h3>英大使通知外部　撤華北駐軍一部　維護在華條約權利　英美立場保持不變</h3>
<p>重慶　此間英大使館已於今日照會中國外交部、略謂因歐洲方面之需要、已將華北英軍撤退一大部、惟法大使館尙無類似之通知送達外部、據法大使署對美國合衆社記者言、使館方面尙未接獲巴黎方面關於此點之訓令、（十四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>香港　港陸軍部公吿、津滬英軍將有一部撤退、但香港方面不受影響、駐軍員額無變動（十三日電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間官方連國務卿赫爾在內、昨日向新聞記者聲稱、雖英法撤退駐華軍隊之一部份、然美國遠東政策仍不改變、當記者詢問美國是否因英法撒兵之故、而將增加或减少駐華軍隊實力、赫爾答稱、「吾人政策與前無異」、記者復詢問美國有否企圖將菲列濱駐軍調至中國、赫爾答稱、渠對該次計劃、一無所知、赫爾繼稱、目前並無任何計劃擬增加美國駐華軍隊、以代替即撤退之英法軍隊之意、（十四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　接近此間中國大使館之人士、雖不滿英法撤退駐華軍隊之一部份、然對撤兵之舉亦不驚異、蓋因英國會向中國保證其遠東政策仍未改變、且英國並未「出賣」中國也、英駐日大使克萊琪爵士最近在東京舉行談話時、曾向日方鄭重聲稱、英國撤兵之舉、並不包含犧牲根據與中國所訂條約獲得之權利及利益、（十三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　「每日電聞」政治記者探悉英政府撤回華北駐兵一部分之決定、係適用於天津、津營之被水淹乃此項決定之一原因、津營損毀如加修理、需費英金一萬鎊、營中狀况殊不適於駐兵、尤以在嚴冬將屆時爲甚、英政府遲至今日始決定撤退駐津英軍一部者、因早日撤兵恐引起英國被迫撤兵之誤會也、現覺英日關係可使此舉不發生誤會、乃有此決定、官場並切實聲明、此舉旣非放棄任何原則、亦不碍及其他條約國、同時此舉不妨視爲英國準備承認日本所作的任何友好姿勢之表示云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　「泰晤士報」今日載有林德賽·畢夫利芝·羅斯·與洛威四人署名一函、言英國遠東政策之問題、首先稱讚美政府利用其駐日大使格魯所發言論之政治家風度、繼謂格魯以友善而堅決之意旨發表言論、其言實獲我心、可代表英國人民之心理、吾人應使美政府確知英國對於此事與美國同一立場、吾人固可歡迎英相所發吿日本人民之文、聲明英國對於日本人民無所怨懟、但吾人更應特別說明、英國亦不放棄其主張之原則、如恪守九國公約之基本義務維護中國之完整與獨立、即此原則之一也、英國應儖力爲美國後援、否則美國之能力與信心或將受影響、而長期騷擾之種籽將萌芽於遠東矣云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日本「廣知報」評論英政府撤回華北駐軍一部分之決定、略謂英國之减少駐華軍隊、似對於兩月前日本所表示之願望、至少予以一部分之依允、英國自稱此舉出於事理由、而未言及日本希望歐洲交戰國撤回其駐華海陸軍一事、惟無論其動機何在、結果則一、此可在英日關係上益多害少云、朝日新聞」倫敦訪電稱、華北英軍將减至一百人或一百五十人、預料英國且將撤退上海與他處軍隊、英軍所遺職務將由美軍接任、蓋依照英美兩國間業已成立之協定也、依此協定、英人在華權利由美　代為照料云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>西園寺憂慮　日本國際地位　對列强改採緩和攻勢　反美宣傳又銷聲匿跡</h3>

<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均平、紐約銀價亦平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美。對法俱平、對滬跌零六二五、美對英長七分二五、對滬升五分、對法大四分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五便士一一五、美匯八元三七五、較假前、英緊零六二五、美反硬零六二五、乃滙兌回長之故、開後出口商首來塞出、兼某行亦有賣意、故市勢即吿硬化、計賣予有利華比現貨美匯八元四三七五及四六八七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡揭曉亦無升降、此後港電亦來吐售、致情形繼續步鬆、計售予外行現貨英金五便士一八七五、同時荷蘭大通亦吐予有利現貨美匯八元半、後最硬曾喊過五便士二零三一二五及八元五三一二五、旋以紗花帮突來扒結、趨勢頓形轉軟、計扒進有利等外行現貨、英金五便士一八七五及一五六一一五、並現貨美匯八元半與四三七五、嗣因扒者中止活動、且某行賣意復萌、是以為狀重見步硬、計某行與荷蘭售予同行現貨英金五便士一八七五、及現貨美滙八元四六八七五至五三一二五、午收銀行現貨賣價、英金五便士二零三一二五、美匯八元五三一二五、比晨開英回鬆零七八一二五、美續硬一五六二五、</p>
<p>新借款說後市重鬆</p>
<p>後市初時出口商塞予滙豐現貨英金、竟硬至五便士二五、時某行與大通稍有吃胃、故市象遂回軟至五便士一八七五及八元半、入後因傳聞中美有新借款成功之說、加以港電復來吐出、致狀態重見鬆硬、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五便士二一八七五、美匯八元五六二五、本月份已與現貨相仿、十二月份英金五便士零九三七五、美匯八元三七五、結果比上週六、現貨英鬆零三一二五、美硬二五、本月份英賤零四六八七五、美長二八一二五、十二月份鬆度與現貨相同、</p>
<p>香港滙市美鬆英平</p>
<p>香港十四日電、今晨滙市開盤平平、英滙現期均不動、美滙現貨猛鬆三七五、為二十四元五六二五、申滙不動、仍開二百八十五元、日匯現貨回鬆二元、為一百零二元、十一時三十分平靜無榮辱、下午二時三十分開盤亦無變化、</p>

<h3>港幫止進　金市跌風又起</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、趨勢仍難脫疲境、且跌風漸熾、實以外匯步鬆、及香港採辦額子轉少、故一般散戶鑒於環境欠佳、不利多方、若手中有貨者、極願隨時薄利了結、但某投機商逢小仍在加碼、無如獨力難拉、晨開即因匯市帶硬、一跌十八元以三千六百九十元開盤、惟入後外匯雖繼續報硬、香港帮一時吸量極宏、且賣風已吿稍殺、一霎那即回高達三千七百十八元、但好景不常、港帮停進、加之匯市鬆途未更、尤聞前曾代港帮吸入之某金號等、忽代浮多吐出、遂又撳小至三千六百七十五元、後雖稍回、但延至午收仍祗三千六百八十元、午後開盤再降至三千六百五十元低盤、其因外匯續硬、及某錢兌業復賣所致、尙幸外匯曾轉緊軟、某金號代投機商亦力進數百兩、漲起廿五元、終以外匯吿鬆人心難振、三千六百六十二元遂為當日收盤價、結果較上週末慘落四十六元、全天交易尙旺、約一千五百兩光景、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌四十六元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞外匯帶硬、人心稍疲、開市竟撳小十八元、證券帮塞予某金號二十兩、為三千六百九十元、嗣外滙雖仍報硬、但香港帮忽委某金號及某錢兌業代為猛吸五百餘兩、故一般散戶拋出者頓形轉少、不久即抬起二十八元、錢兌業進銀樓帮二十兩、為三千七百十八元、此後港帮止進、且外匯仍趨鬆途、加以銀樓帮及錢兌業等紛來爭先吐塞、故又不支卜瀉、傾跌四十三元、銀樓帮售予金號一十兩、為三千六百七十五元、旋以外匯一度轉軟、又起回風、步高二十元、錢兌業進證券帮五十兩、為三千六百九十五元、其時外匯復吿鬆動、且前代香港帮所進之某金號等忽代客戶出籠、故重見下降、步跌十五元、錢兌業賣予證券帮十兩、為三千六百八十元作午收價、午後初開即小五元、某錢兌業售予金號二十兩、為三千六百七十五元、後因外滙頗硬、且某錢兌業頻來復出、續跌二十五元、銀樓帮賣予證券帮三十兩、為三千六百五十元、時外匯突然回軟、且某金號代投機商力進數百兩、遂回起二十五元、某金號進錢兌業二十兩、為三千六百七十五元、入後外滙忽再硬、且某余號進胃吃足、故跌風又起、重小十五元、銀樓帮吐予金號五十兩、為三千六百六十元、後錢兌業售予金號十兩、為三千六百六十二元作晚收價、結果比上週末軋小四十六元、全天六十八元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進的减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元之譜、</p>
<p>首飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百七十五元、迨至下午三時掛小五元、結果大同行改懸三百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收進的均改小十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣銳落</h3>

<h3>銀行準備會　更改利率</h3>

<h3>印銀回跌英美平</h3>
<p>十三日倫敦電、銀市沉寂而平、缺乏變化、收盤後仍平、大條銀近遠期均無更動、紐的銀電、美現貨呆定、又孟買銀電、印銀市况略疲、現貨縮三安那十二月降七安那、一月小九安那、</p>
<h3>證券　內債興奮　外股觀望</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况忽有轉風、空方於最初時猶在壓迫、但以進戶及補空湧起、市價一度壓小、旋即引起反動、同時市塲謠言中美父有新借款之說、事實如何、在不可知之數、但久經壓迫之人心、得此已覺興奮、市價上騰、惜消息恐非事實、故收盤父趨小數角、昨日初開益昌照市賣出、市價冉小二三角、旋以買戶蠭起、大豐久豐五號二十號以及潤利聯和等均有買進、午收反跌為漲、午後昌記補進三十八及五十號亦有需要、大豐轉出、順亨鴻大亦有出脫、而價仍堅强、丙種復穿出七元、結果市價比前漲起數角至一元二角、惟收盤後市價忽瀉落二三角左右、成交的一百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股市交易、成交大中華火柴公司股五十股、價為十七元二角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所下午股市交易、因時間短促、了無特色、大衆興趣極微、投機家似在期待星期四新帳來臨時、再定行止、一股股價、與前無異、祇實業股方面、有數種當價格稍形盤上時、略呈賣多於買景象、橡皮股微軟、</p>
<p>本埠匯通洋行經理之斯呢王橡皮有限公司昨經董事會議決、定十一月二十五日開派截至一九四〇年一月底止一年度之中期股息、每股國幣三元、並決定於十一月二十日起至廿五日止、停止股票過戶、</p>

<p>倫敦十三日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍告平穩、上下檔各公債均無榮辱、</p>
<h3>紗花　粗紗客銷獨健　廠開為額亦鉅</h3>
<p>紗市　入平靜之境、實則海外逐步上升、以致原棉基礎穩固、所以人心安定望好、同時實銷雖不見發達、然港帮對於十支粗紗納胃旣健、而搜羅殷切、且大數向廠方直接開購、惟細紗採辦尙屬平席、故市態遂呈細平粗堅之象也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開同業相聚談論、謂上日封關中、廣幫粗紗辦進二三百包、大都由廠家售出、人心尙平、旋以匯票開出又見放長、人氣平凡、二十支雙馬呌喊為六百四十五六元、然廣幫銷路仍缺乏、惟同業鑒於海外棉市上升、心思看好、復來收進二三百包、市價回高、升二三元至六百四十九元、查半日間成交統計一千四百四十五包、上日成交五百七十五包、行情二十支雙馬疲五角、天女雙地球平平、與上日之價無甚軒輊、廠方由永安廠開出十支特金城二百五十包、價為五百五十五元、統益廠開出金鷄一百二十包、價為五百十八元、崇信廠開出十支大發一百二十包、價為五百十八元、振華廠開出十八支雙龍一百包、價為五百八十五元、今日出口棉紗有三百二十件運烟台、又一百八十件運天津、十件運動新加坡、茲將各帮口買去之額量列下、</p>
<h3>原棉看好　同業活動搜購</h3>
<p>本棉交易尙稱發展、同業買賣尤其熱鬧、且市上議論大衆心理看樂觀、原因是歐美棉市一致昂騰、認為華棉有脚地、所以推測前途、漲向多而跌面少、否則早已飛跳、幸美滙日見放長、滙兌之鬆度、與棉價塊角之比率關係允為密切、美金加長半元、美棉價格假使不動、採算價每担要廉十餘允也、蘇北來源、計通花二千包、常陰沙一千一百八十九包、茲將現棉情形錄左（成交價廠買送廠巳烘水、同業係棧交、）</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來又趨靜寂、紗廠以紗銷無起色，對原棉暫無購意、同業間以靜默巳久、極欲思動、擬購辦四十二支原棉之意頗濃、惟因滙兌之不穩定、故祇能暫時觀望也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、日來殊為堅挺、昨日晨初即因受投機者之購買而漲、布疋銷數日見暢通、因之引起同業及大衆之購買、現貨交易異常活躍、此乃上漲之主因、後因空頭抵補近期、結果收盤、近期較之上日漲起十餘磅音、遠期漲三四磅音、印度停市、預測漲五羅比餘、埃及停市、利物浦漲十便士、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布銷零星　甬幫裝運尙旺</h3>
<p>布市以各路現銷不振、售盤微挫、白貨粗布。粗斜每疋跌五分至二角、細布·細斜跌一二角、漂染印花布疋開價平平、一部份跌價一角至二角半、各種絨布價亦趨疲、蓋市上存貨充足、客路需胃零星、門市店因時令關係、添辦稍稀之故、本街成交白貨粗布·細斜紋二百餘包、色布·漂布·印花貨·絨布一百餘箱、滇帮添辦印花·嗶嘰·直貢花布·綫呢·士林藍布五六十箱、閩帮辦色斜·綫呢四五十箱、甬帮辦粗有·細布·一百數十包、色布·色斜·印花絨·漂布·羽綢四五十件、近以溫州航綫時遭阻碍、滬甬綫裝貨更形擁擠、</p>
<h3>糧食　粳米來源尙不弱　客秈操縱獲利出籠　各米行市先漲後疲</h3>
<p>昨日各帮米糧來源、河下無到、車輪運來有蘇同崑太等貨十餘車、靑泗楓嘉等貨八九車、及常帮貨山白茆口與滸浦口轉到一二千包尙不為巨、大局市面、自前因囤戶操縱、各貨價突飛猛晋、昨則開手尙有餘波、一般囤戶旣欲謀保全巳進之貨、更圖牟利心思、晨間即復出手搜求、故各價在客家提抬之中、一律喊高半元有奇、一種混沌景象、不亞於前市、本鄉作客、以各價一路飛升、計已達頂盤、都呈戒心、不敢貿然競進、除應需稍事添購外、均即袖手觀望、實胃旣屬小暢、囤戶遂亦無能為力、所以近午銷場轉呆、市面節節下降、除客秈所漲特多、所回亦較少外、至於新粳及蘆羊尖情形亦屬相仿、若常特粳初開三十二半、收盤亦僅好二三角為三十一元二三角、特蘆尖自二十九元後至二十八元七八角、特粳自二十八元半、後至二十八元二三角、南港早稻二十九元至二十八元六七角、次二十七元八角、獨窰菉種及變元等以去路素僅零星、昨則際此環境、自始至終、未見業辱耳</p>
<h3>粉市廠子盤　降低一角　麥市呆滯</h3>
<p>現粉廠盤、改為七元二角、比上週來降低一角矣、蓋因近日客銷岑寂、更受內地雜牌粉與日廠粉傾銷影饗、政市而一蹶不振、昨日廠盤雖巳降低、而實銷仍感缺乏、除本街零批、日當交易外、客化亦祇靑島帮微動、故砲車粉仍須七元三角、而車船牌棧單貨、則比廠盤又別小五分至一角不等、市面尙在靜疲過程中、</p>
<p>小麥市况、又趨擯持、連日雖有到貨、而為數不多、各廠與行囤進胃一致呆懈、貨方尙不願廉價求脫、除少數直接送廠外、正式市面、無形停頓云、十五日麵粉三千五百包運天津、五百包運塘沾、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖平庸</h3>
<p>昨日糖市仍不振、公會劃盤、粗砂白老貨五十一元七角、新貨五十二元七角、轉口貨比前日降落八角、為四十二元、太古車白B嘜五十六元一、H嘜車赤四十元、荷赤仍為四十二元、其餘無上落、國糖聞某號開出即出漳刁八百包、價為現鈔三十一元、太古四川輪到黃江靑五百包、因其貨好歹不一、故扯價為三十六元、東鄕赤開出百餘包、價三十四元五角、嗬蘭糖昨有五百噸來滬、</p>
<h3>海味　安南蝦尾獻新</h3>
<p>安南蝦尾以靑黃不接、市間早已乏存、値茲秋冬之交、新貨開始見樣、前日首水貨到十五箱、身份色澤尙佳、隨則開通、其價為二百十五元、冬菇二十二件、昨由寗波運來、</p>
<h3>煤炭煤球再跌</h3>
<p>煤球行情、日前因浦東某廠成立、競爭跌價、廠盤削低、但終因雙方不能諒解、加之新廠以贈品為號召、機製煤球業會員各廠、為謀應付計、不得不犧牲到底、一跌再跌、昨夜又集議廠盤續跌兩元、計開義泰興·南洋·國華·東方大廠煤球、同業送到、每噸六十元、小廠貨便宜一兩元不等、</p>
<h3>進出口　豆麻運往南京</h3>
<p>昨日生油三百聽、自靑島運來、出口往新加坡有豆子六百包、芝蔴四百九十八包、運往庇能有豆千五十包、寗波來靑烟三百廿件、紙八千七百六十件、</p>

<h3>二批分幣券發行期　臨時公佈</h3>
<p>外傳巳運滬將發行　純係各方推測之詞</p>
<p>中央銀行發行一分五分分幣券後、首批五十萬元早已發行完竣、二批五十萬元由美商永寗公司承印、依照合同分批解貨、中央銀行上海分行已準備於短期內發行、流通上海市面、外傳已由香港運抵上海、及定二十一日發行之說均不確、至於發行日期、該行迄未決定、</p>
<p>角票缺乏</p>
<p>近來市上角幣、極不敷行用、致少數烟兌店對國幣折易角幣、陡然提增差率、大致國幣一元、僅能易換角幣九角九分、甚至在偏僻地點、尙不到此數、亦有以角幣缺乏而拒絕兌換者、若干商店對國幣出找角幣、大都須購貨在二角以上、上述情形、居民已極感不便、據中央銀行消息、上次於第一批分幣券發行時、曾兌出角幣二百餘萬元、但兌進者、多將新角票收藏、致未普遍、現第二批角票不日運滬、故角票之流通並無問題云、</p>

<h3>模型飛機競賽　可以鼓動各界人士　去研究航空的知識</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>在科學產物突飛猛進的現在，在戰雲光彌漫地球週遭的現在，航空知識的獲取和灌輸，無可否認的，是有其相當的重要性。尤其是我們，於忍受慘酷轟炸的今日，更是不容忽略的。我們目前雖不能獲得飛機構造的實體來觀摩與練習，但從形象的模型中，也未始不可取得其中的原理和功效，至少，較製作別種趣味化的模型，總有一點意義，總有一點價值。</p>
<p>這個模型飛機競賽大會，是規定了中外人士都可以自由參加。其款式，不論飛行模型，或實體模型均可，不過所採用的原料，必須有一部份是用鋼精製成的才合格，不論鋁片，鋁箔，鋁粉（因為主辦的是鋼精廠）。這雖然不免含有）點推銷其產料的營業意味，但因與賽飛機的模型，繪圖，設計，製作，均須參加者實地動手製造出來，所以，我們是樂於參加的。</p>
<p>從事製造模型，自然需要相當時間。該會日期雖規定在一九四零年一月九日在大新公司舉行，而現在就開始宣傳。有這一個多月的時間，自然很可以從容地研究製作。對於轟炸機，驅逐機，戰鬥機，偵察機，運輸機等，形式雖不固定，然其外觀的角度和內部的設備結構，是必須要酷肖眞的。因為愈用心血去研究，愈有經騐，而航空知識也愈益豐富，所以其評判的原則，就係根據構造準確，設計完善，整潔，美觀，而評判出等級（鋼精多少是不生影饗的）。</p>
<p>假使我們準備參加，而從事製造這種模型的時候，非但於自己有興趣，而且，還可收得敎育子女的功效。如晃你家裏有兒童的，正不妨當他們的面動手做，間接鼓動天眞的小心坎，使他們對航空發生興趣。也許由於這種側面的觀摩，會立下一個凌雲的壯志，將來成為空軍的幹員，保衛祖國的領空；或者做一個飛行家去橫渡海洋，甚至做一個飛機工人，這種收穫都是無法可以評價的。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十七回　習外勤報人新領域　服內務學舍小排場</p>
<p>當時她們結伴到上海去吃余澹雲喜酒的人，已有六人。朱愛人，何家兩位小姐，吳君素姊妹，還添了一位新朋友邵慧華。邵慧華本來一輛機器脚踏車，不到一小時，就可以到上海了，她此刻擠在她們一起。原來她是喜歡朋友的，到了蘇州，與吳君索姊妹同行，一路上在火車裏談談說說，比較舒服一點。沒有什麽急事，何必騎了機器脚踏車去。但是這機器脚踏車，倒要隨身帶的，也許到了上海，報館裏個命令，便要出發的。到了火車站，只向行李車裏一寄，不是也到了上海嗎？她到吳君素那裏，尙未吃過飯，就在她們的宿舍食堂裏胡亂吃了一餐飯。因為邵慧華把旅行作為家常，到處可以吃飯，到處可以睡覺，她有兩句口號，呌做：「睡眠就地滾，吃飯滿天飛。她已成了一個健全的體魄，不似從前的千金小姐一般，動一動就要人來扶持。又不似中國舊小說上所描寫的，弱不禁風的，那種林黛玉式的身體。她並不是中國俠義小說上的那種飛劍斬人頭的女俠客，但她也有自衛的力量，出人也常帶精鍊的武器。現在吳君素吿訴了她，午後三點鐘還有三位朋友來，是一同到上海去的，她格外高興。說起朱愛人她是曉得的，說起何家兩位小姐，她却並未見過面。又因為她們是雙生，說她們面貌是模一樣的，她更要看看，何况她素來是愛好朋友的呢。今見了何家兩位小姐，自然見傾心，愛好朋友的人，自然朋友多個，好一個。這時朱愛人便問吳君素道：「我們什麽時候去呢？到了車站上，不是要買票嗎？我們早一點去不好嗎？」吳君素笑了笑，把她的書桌抽屜開了，拿出了六張火車票來，給她看了道：「火車票小是已經買好了，還要什麼火車票呢？」朱愛八道「咦！你已經派人到火車站去買了嗎？」吳君素道：「何必到火車姑呢？這裏便有個旅行社咧。」原來這個東吳大學校，敎職員　學生們，就有三千多人。加着附設中學，鄰近大學的，總共也有五千多人。他們學校裏，便有個信託服務社，而服務社內，又附設一個小小旅行社。（二〇二）</p>

<h3>編結師與結絨綫女工　營業競爭劇烈絨線店添聘編結師　結絨線女士均係包工制待遇較差</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>天冷了，絨綫又上市啦。雖然為的受了歐戰的影響，今年的絨綫，舶來品每磅九塊多，國產絨線也要七八塊一磅。但我們由於大小百貨商店，都把整個廚窗堆滿了絨錢，以及娘兒姐兒在穿梭般來往，走進百貨商店去選購絨綫，事實吿訴你，絨綫的價錢儘讓它貴，穿絨錢結成的衣服的人還是不少哩。</p>
<p>近年來在上海這都市裏面，不拘大小商店，一般的商人對於營業方面，競爭得相當劇烈，想出了種種的方法來號召顧客。廣吿學，廚窗學，已在長足的進步中。在這樣的一個環境裏面，出售絨綫的商店，當然也不致例外，霓紅燈的廣吿，大减價的旗幟，另外添設特價貨品部，更有許多出售絨綫的商店，自本年起，添聘了編結師，義務為買絨錢的顧客指導編結方法，目的當然也在吸引顧客。</p>
<p>大家知道，法租界的興聖街是絨綫市塲的總匯。在那邊，一般的絨綫店，除了佈置裝璜比往年又更進一步外，差不多每一家都聘有編結師，坐在店堂裏面，拿了針，絨錢，在指導精巧的編結方法。四面圍滿了娘兒們，姑娘們，有的在看，有的在學。除了興聖街之外，就是其他的馬路上面，規模大些的百貨公司，在出售絨線的櫃上，也多半聘有編結師，為顧客當面的指導。據說這些編結師，大部分是馮秋萍女士所創的那個編結學校編結裏的畢業生。這極職位是臨時的，絨線過時了就會解僱。待遇方面，大致每月二三十元至四五十元不等，看絨綫店的規模和編結師的藝技而定的。關於膳宿方面，大概是供膳不供宿。當一個編結師，如算有半年工作，那麼也可賺到二三百塊錢呢！</p>
<p>但在上海，偏有許多娘兒姐兒祇知享樂，不做女紅，想穿衣服，不拘什麽，都去買現成的。結果就使一般的百貨商店，除了絨錢之外，更出售結好的絨綫衣物。絨線衫，絨線襪子，雖然用機製的居多，但手工結成的也是不少。因此，一到了冬天，便會有好多女工，靠結絨線生活哩。</p>
<p>結絨線的女工，有的由百貨公司直接僱定，有的由結絨線的工廠僱用，結成了大批絨線衣物，再批發到百貨商店裏去的。以待遇說來，兩種女工，都是包工制度的。結成了一件絨綫衣服，就付你一件的代價。絨線雖比去年貴一倍多，可是結絨線女工的工資還是和去年差不多，結成一件馬甲，祇一塊錢多些的工資，一件絨綫衫，祇有兩元。而且憑你手脚怎樣快，一件絨線衫也要結兩三天，所以平均每月賺不到三十塊錢。以今日「孤島」的生活稈度說來，那麼替人家結絨錢，除去個人的故食，所剩也有限，同樣是結絨錢，却比編結師要差多哩。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>游藝與人生</h3>
<p>— 晏然</p>
<p>淤藝－良好而有意義的游藝，對於觀衆們的影響，是很巨人的。它能鼓勵大衆生活的興趣，指導我們處世的方針，做人的態度，……這些，還不算偉大，在這抗戰通近勝利的關頭，它更能在無形之中，堅定大衆抗戰必勝建國必成的決心。就這一點看來，目今的游藝界，不僅負起了指導大衆向上奮鬥的使命，就民族抗爭的立塲而論，它尤其含有不容忽視的偉大的職責呢。</p>
<p>然而，游藝與人生的關係，以及對抗戰前途的影響，固然這樣。可是，在如今孤島的游藝界中，能够眞實的負起這個神聖的使命的，誠然小少；而掛着游藝的招牌，天天幹着陷害靑年大衆的勾當的，却也很多，這是很使我們感到痛心的一件事。</p>
<p>因此，我們希望孤島的游藝界，應該自己檢察一番，同業與同業之間，更該老實不客氣的互相監督着。如果發覺某一個游藝場合，在幹那！「掛羊頭賣狗肉」的陷害大衆的勾當時，必須予以嚴厲的制裁，以維持游藝界的風紀。因為唯有這樣，才能减少靑年大衆墮落的機會，而間接增加抗·建·的力量。</p>
<p>總之，游藝對於人生的影響，以及抗戰的前途，是有着密切的關係。怎樣才能完成這個偉大的使命呢？這是有待於游藝界同人的努力，和一般從業員身體力行的效果。</p>
<h3>論新都之「汾河灣」</h3>
<p>— 遊記者</p>
<p>「汾河灣一」，重在說白與做工。按平劇裏面，說白大致分為引，詩，表，白，歌五類；做工的分表情，身段，武工三節；此劇特重於「白」和「表情」。該劇內之生旦對白，必須語氣流利自然，同時加以表情，又須維肯維妙。苟當劇者工力稍遜，則全劇精采，喪失殆盡了。</p>
<p>筆者昨日赴新都劇塲，觀于素蓮與楊瑞亭兩藝人合演「汾河灣」。到時恰巧素蓮上塲。素蓮飾柳迎春，深深刻劃出劇中人的身份性格，楊瑞亭去薛仁貴，自然是老到極了。兩人對白，十分動聽。對白的語句，與原劇本略有增减。夫妻倆在寒審內小口角時，均特別增加對白，頗為風趣。惟有兩句刪了原劇本的就是仁貴拿黃金印出來的時候，柳迎春先當作沒有用的銅，再由仁貴說明這是黃金印。這裏本來仁貴要接着說：「如今你是一品夫人吓。柳迎春也說：「哈哈，一品夫人了。一同時就有喜上眉梢的表情。這兩句「一品夫人」頗重要，似不宜刪去。</p>
<p>總觀全劇，于楊配搭洵屬得當，說白簡潔老練，蓋說白最忌拖泥帶水，尤重咬字韻味。筆者對於陰陽之分，尖團之辨，未敢亂說，然聽素蓮的說白，字音旣凖，聲調也輕重疾徐，恰到好處；同時能將喜怒哀樂驚懼愛惡，儘量自然地形於面部，的確非常動人。此劇唱工不多，只兩段西皮與二六，素蓮唱來，亦十分悅耳。據筆者所知，素蓮能戲甚多，花旦戲身段戲均佳，武工亦嫻熟，至於楊瑞亭，則為早享盛名的平劇名角，他與素蓮合演，堪稱功力悉敵，藝人濱佳劇，自是不同凡響啦！</p>
<h3>劉繼羣昨晨逝世</h3>
<p>— 銀笛</p>
<p>前晚播音突中風　遺體定明日大殮</p>
<p>滑稽明星殞落</p>
<p>中國影壇上的丑角之一，一向和一瘦皮猴」韓蘭根做着老搭檔的大胖子劉繼羣，突然在昨晨逝世了！這是繼尙冠武之後，又一顆巨星的殞落。</p>
<p>是前天（十三日）的晚上，劉繼羣經人邀請，到大美電台去播音，不幸突然中風，當時播音室中人，大為驚恐，連忙將他車送同仁醫院，誰知醫院當局因劉繼羣的神智已經昏迷，竟拒絕不納，於是祇好改送到西愛咸斯路愼成里三號他的家中，結果雖經延醫診視，終因血管爆裂，無法挽救，延至寅時，也就是昨日上午，終於一瞑不視，與世長辭了。</p>
<p>劉繼羣是江蘇武進人，享年四十歲，遺有一子一女，子十七歲，女十四歲，還都在求學時代。劉夫人在繼羣逝世後，號啕大慟，哀傷得了不得。遺體巳舁入世界殯儀館，定十六日大殮。</p>
<p>劉從事於水銀燈生活，已有十餘年的歷史，他的第一部作品是太平洋影片公司的「摘星之女」，是與王漢倫台演的。前幾年，他在聯華影業公司，開始和韓蘭根合作，纔獲得了東方勞萊哈台的雅號。現在，則是新華影業公司的基本演員之一；他在銀幕上，不僅以小丑的姿態演出，就是老年人一類的角色，他也是相常擅長的。</p>
<p>他的最後遺作，是湯傑導演的「二房東與三房客」滑稽片，劉繼羣在此片中，飾小陳一角，幸而全片巳在劉逝世之前攝竣，不久且將在新光大戲院公映。此後這一位「東方哈台」，祗有在銀幕上看到他的音容了！</p>
<h3>銀海一勺</h3>

<p>新華邀史新吳素秋拍「盤絲洞」，尙在談判中，或有成議之望。</p>
<p>「孔夫子」戲本現由費穆編寫竣事，巳定於本月十七日在聯華總廠開拍，服裝道具已在趕製中。惟孔子二角演員人選迄未決定，一說聘蕭英担任，日內可見分曉。</p>
<p>國華新明星陳重，初名陳根生，自「李三娘」後，即改名陳重，他和舞臺藝人鄭重，恰像一對異姓同名的勞萊哈台。</p>
<h3>大華將開幕　首映金玉滿堂</h3>
<p>大華大戲院的全部工程，巳經達到塔尖的頂巓。復旦大學土木系的學生，平素對於本市的偉大建築，常作事前的巡禮，以作理論的實證。特地寫了封信給大華當局，徵求他的同意。當山該院總經理李迪雲覆函允許。就在十日的下半天，全體出席，參觀全院，對於建築師陳植的改造工作，表示衷心的欽佩。聽說該院的開幕鉅片，已經決定「金玉滿堂」，全片滑稽歌唱，米基羅納的表演，壓倒了埃第康泰，是一九三九年的示威作品。開幕日期，還沒有正式決定呢</p>
<h3>梨園外紀一齮表揚民族英雄的戲劇</h3>
<p>— 徐慕</p>
<p>說罷，卽起身進入後堂。此時祇夫人幼子在側，恩愛夫妻，固難割捨，而父子之情，亦不忍永別，詎奈賊兵已邇，殺聲震犬，於是遇吉乃不得不以毅然之手段，逼詢夫人曰：「我為國死，不知汝能為我守節否？」時當封建時代，夫人又中年貌美，自亦無怪周有此問，但夫人亦深明大義者，今為堅定周之信心起見，乃竟拔其佩創，肖刎夫前，公子見慈母被逼慘死，遂亦碰壁而亡。遇吉方在悲妻傷子，忽兒後院火光燭天，原來老夫人入內更衣後，急命家將搬連柴草，園繞後堂，並堅囑點火焚房，巳則端坐室中，靜等一死，老家將以身受主人三世厚恩，不忍目覩主母死難慘狀，遂亦投身烈熖中殉主而亡。迨遇吉趕至，已莫可施救，自思老母妻子俱已慘死，當然無可掛念，因向火光中叩拜祝聯，面後折至前廳，聚集家將及城內敢死之士，一齊殺出城來。此時人人抱必死之心，個個懷報國之志，以一當百，殺死賊兵，不計其數，但卒以衆寡懸殊，賊兵矢石如雨，均集周身，故終至力竭氣盡，死於亂箭之下。總計忠孝節義四宇，乃為周氏合家佔全，故該劇又名「滿門忠烈」者，亦就事實而言也。（一四一）</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Mostly Eliminated in the Xian Mian Area of Central Hubei; Remnants of Japanese Troops in Zhongxiang Withdraw Outside the City; Japanese Troops Southeast of Nanchang Repelled</h3>
<p>Changde: Japanese troops intruding into the Xiantao and Mianyang areas of central Hubei have been thoroughly swept away by various Chinese military units and have been mostly eliminated. Currently, only four to five hundred remnant Japanese troops remain entrenched in Xiantao Town, and a certain Chinese unit is currently encircling and annihilating them. In addition, the number of Japanese warships on the Bai Luoji river surface has slightly increased compared to before. There are currently five Japanese warships and dozens of motorboats docked there. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: Chinese troops shelled Zhongxiang County on the 12th, destroying part of the ammunition depot inside the city. The remnant Japanese troops have already moved outside the city. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Pingjiang: Sporadic artillery battles still occur from time to time between Chinese and Japanese forces on the Jiuling front, and the situation remains unchanged. In the Xiu River area, both sides have been in a stalemate since October 10th on the line between Chapi'ao and Changlunshan in the western suburbs of Wuning. There are only occasional contacts between patrols. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: Chinese troops in northern Hunan briefly recovered Wu Li Pai on the evening of the 13th. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: Japanese troops in the southeast of Nanchang previously launched repeated harassment attacks, all of which were repelled. They no longer dare to act rashly. On the evening of the 12th, Chinese troops dispatched a team to attack the Hujia area south of Wucunxu. The Japanese troops responded in panic and were quite overwhelmed. Chinese troops then bravely charged into the Japanese formation, engaging in fierce fighting for about two hours, killing many Japanese soldiers. Subsequently, Japanese reinforcements counterattacked, and the Chinese withdrew to their original defenses. Many military supplies were seized in this battle. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman stated today that the main events of the past week were the Japanese attempt to occupy the operational bases of Chinese mobile troops in the provinces of Shanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Anhui. In western Shanxi, Japanese troops attacked Chinese positions on the east bank of the Yellow River near Jixian, Yixian, Puxian, and Xiangning. Chinese troops attacked the westward-moving Japanese troops from both the north and south routes. The northern route of Chinese troops moved out from Zhongdu, and the southern route of Chinese troops moved northeast from the north bank of the Fen River. As a result of the Chinese counteroffensive, the Japanese troops in western Shanxi have now retreated eastward, and there is no trace of Japanese troops on the east bank of the Yellow River in western Shanxi. In the battles on the north bank of the Yangtze River in western Hubei, Chinese troops launched a three-pronged counteroffensive to recapture Mianyang, which was occupied by Japanese troops, and recaptured the city on November 10. Japanese troops have retreated towards Xiantao Town. As for northern Anhui and Jiangsu, Chinese troops have been very active in attacking the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the Grand Canal. Therefore, Japanese troops attacked the bases of Chinese mobile troops in Fengtai and Shouxian, southwest of Bengbu. Both locations were recaptured by Chinese troops on November 7, and the Chinese side has gained an advantageous position to attack the railway. In addition, Chinese troops also recaptured Gaoyou and Shaobo, enabling them to cut off traffic on the Grand Canal. Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi attacked Chinese troops based in Minshan, because these troops often raided the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway. Japanese troops also launched attacks from Yangxin and De'an, but they also failed. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Warships at Humen Struck Chinese Mines and Sank; All Japanese Soldiers on Board Drowned; Japanese Side Announces Blockade of Humen</h3>

(14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continuing East of Xiangning</h3>
<p>Xingji: On the morning of the 12th, Chinese troops attacked Duanshanling, east of Xiangning, and continuously breached two lines of Japanese defenses, directly assaulting the Japanese artillery position. Fierce fighting lasted for quite some time. The Japanese stubbornly resisted on one side and reinforced with over two hundred troops from Yitaitou, harassing Jin Gangling in an attempt to cut off the Chinese rear. They were met with dense artillery fire from Chinese troops, and Japanese soldiers fell into the mountain gullies one after another. Another unit of Chinese troops simultaneously advanced to the area east of ×××. As of the evening of the 13th, fierce fighting was still ongoing. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: Over three hundred Japanese troops from southern Shanxi, on the 4th, invaded Taishanmiao from Liuguancun (southeast of Yongji). Three Japanese aircraft assisted in the air.

(14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Engage in Firefight Northwest of Changtaiguan</h3>
<p>Nanyang: On the evening of the 9th, several hundred Japanese troops from Changtaiguan sneaked to the vicinity of Denggang (northwest of Changtaiguan) and had a misunderstanding with the Japanese troops entrenched in Denggang. They immediately engaged in a fierce firefight, resulting in many casualties. A certain unit of Chinese troops seized the opportunity to attack, engaging in fierce fighting throughout the night, killing countless Japanese troops. By the morning of the 10th, the remaining Japanese troops fled back to Changtaiguan. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops East of Funing Recapture Hexing Town</h3>
<p>A certain location in northern Jiangsu: Chinese troops have been attacking Japanese troops in Funing and Hexing Town (east of Funing) for days, achieving many victories. Japanese troops in Funing have retreated north, and Chinese troops are currently encircling and attacking the remaining Japanese troops. Hexing Town has been recaptured by Chinese troops. Japanese troops abandoned over a hundred corpses and fled in defeat. Chinese troops are currently in pursuit. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Use Painted Mines; Aircraft Bombs Destroyed</h3>
<p>Xi'an: On the 1st, Chinese troops planted mines near Yejiagang, a suburb of Lanfeng, on the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, destroying a train of Japanese ammunition and artillery vehicles. The ammunition and artillery exploded completely. For a time, there was a huge roar, heard for several miles. The Japanese troops were extremely shocked. At 6:00 AM on the same day, a train of Japanese engineers arrived from Nei Huang Station and ran into the second mine. The locomotive was also destroyed, and more than 10 Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. Traffic on the Bian-Xu route was once again blocked. This was the greatest loss for the Japanese since the opening of the Bian-Xu line. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Officer Writes Article Reviewing Sino-Japanese War; Japanese Attempt to Invade Repeatedly Fails; Chinese Troops Resist Firmly and Can Counterattack</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Trud newspaper, the organ of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, today published an article by Soviet Army Colonel Vorobyov reviewing the situation in China. The article stated that the Japanese attempts at invasion and offensive over the past two months have repeatedly failed. Since occupying Guangzhou and Hankou in the autumn of 1938, the Japanese army has consistently failed to have a good organization to cope with large-scale warfare or make large-scale offensive. The Japanese army's attempt to encircle and annihilate the Chinese army repeatedly failed. The Chinese army used mobile warfare in conjunction with guerrilla warfare to deal a serious blow to the Japanese army. The great victory in northern Hunan almost indicated the failure of the Japanese army's strategy. Recently, the Japanese troops on each front have been unable to be in an advantageous position, and the initiative of the war is on the Chinese side rather than the Japanese side. The activities of the Japanese troops in North China and Shanxi not only encountered strong resistance from the Chinese troops, but the Chinese troops were also able to implement counter-offensives. The Japanese troops in South China have been forced to abandon their initiative, and their state of operational retreat is extremely embarrassing. Recently, battles have occurred in the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou triangle area, and the Japanese troops have also been unable to be in an active position. The Japanese troops must simultaneously fight on two fronts: they must deal with the regular army on the front and deal with the guerrillas in the rear. The situation in which the guerrillas in the three provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong and in the Shanghai-Nanjing-Guangdong areas disrupt the Japanese army's rear is extremely fierce. Although Japanese troops are stationed on each railway line, guerrillas come and go on the railway line every day. The guerrillas' raids annihilate small groups of Japanese troops or isolated units every night. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain in the Far East</h3>
<p>On the 12th of this month, the British War Office announced: "For military convenience, the British troops stationed in Tianjin and Beijing, China, under the 1901 (Xinchou) Treaty, are hereby ordered to withdraw most of them; thereafter, Britain will only leave soldiers there sufficient to protect British property and maintain order. This decision has been notified to the governments of all countries stationed in North China." So the troops are withdrawn, and France follows.</p>
<p>From a superficial observation of the recent Far East, there are no new changes; in fact, everyone cannot help but feel that all kinds of new changes are brewing. From a superficial observation of Britain's withdrawal of troops, according to the formal and informal explanations from the British side in the past two days, there are seven key points: (1) The scope of the troop withdrawal is limited to North China, and the troops stationed elsewhere in China are not withdrawn; (2) Most of the troops stationed in North China are withdrawn, but not all of them; (3) The withdrawal is for military reasons in the European war, not for any other reason in the Far East, China, or North China; (4) The withdrawal is because the winter barracks facilities are inadequate; (5) The withdrawal is because the barracks were affected by floods, and repairs would cost tens of thousands of British pounds; (6) The right to station troops and all other rights under the Xinchou Treaty are retained; (7) There were plans to withdraw earlier, but withdrawing in the past would have been suspected of accepting Japanese threats and of preparing to abandon all rights in North China, and the withdrawal now is considered not to be misunderstood by the world or the Japanese in this way. The French side's explanation is that the nature and scope of the troop withdrawal are the same as Britain's. Britain and France are allies in the European war, and they also express their so-called "policy parallelism" and "action parallelism" in the Far East. Speaking of the matter itself, although the British Army authorities issued a public notice and the diplomatic authorities notified various countries, it showed solemnity and extraordinary features; however, we are willing to deeply believe in the loyalty of the British and French explanations on this issue; therefore, in addition to superficial observation, we do not need to review it further; that is, it may as well be regarded as a small action that is irrelevant to the overall situation, and a small news that is irrelevant to the grand purpose is also possible. However, around this small action and small news, there are things that can be inferred.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Britain, France, and the United States landed in Gulangyu with the same number of sailors; at that time, the international forum stated that the three countries adopted a parallel policy towards the Far East and therefore took parallel actions. This was its beginning, and it was expected that the situation in the Far East would gradually become clearer. However, as the facts showed later, the effect of clearing was not seen, and the parallel situation was soon abandoned. Therefore, Britain negotiated alone in Tokyo, and the United States resolutely announced the abolition of the commercial treaty; as soon as the British War Office announced the withdrawal of a part of the troops stationed in North China, the US Secretary of State immediately stated that the troops would not be withdrawn and the policy would not change. Indeed, the environment, national power, and basic beliefs of Britain and France are very different from those of the United States, and there are things that cannot be parallel. What Britain and France are urgently needed today is Germany, so for all issues, they weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the impact on the German issue as the center, and then separately choose whether to adopt them. Britain has repeatedly stated that it has sympathy for China and maintains its original policy; however, if we try to infer its intentions, it probably believes that maintaining its policy towards China has nothing to do with its policy towards Germany; and that the proper handling of relations with Japan will have a serious impact on the German issue; therefore, the British people never "sell out China" in their subjectivity, and their actions always seek to avoid friction with Japan. Furthermore, the reasons why Britain has formed such ideas are: First, it only feels the necessity of defeating Germany, but the confidence to win is not enough to match it; therefore, it attaches importance to the temporary war against Germany and ignores the long-term gains and losses in other aspects. Second, the rights of Britain overseas take the power of material as the only guarantee; therefore, for the power held by other countries, it either prevents it or seeks to use it; in this kind of traditional concept, it often denies that deep feelings have the final decisive power, so it is not good at cultivating feelings, and even sacrifices feelings. Third, Britain overestimates itself, thinking that giving people a smile is the supreme grace, but it does not know that ambitious people are greedy and will never be satisfied; giving them bait is only to promote their desires. Because of these three factors, Britain actually has its inherent hesitation in the Far East; the Far East War is creating modern history, and the degree of Britain's hesitation in the Far East today is unprecedented in its modern history. The hesitation is so great, and it has been hesitating for so long. The reason why it has not retreated is nothing else, the United States has never held Britain in parallel, but for the sake of dealing with Germany, Britain has been unable to go against the United States. The United States' Far East policy is indeed steadfast.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Notifies Foreign Ministry of Withdrawal of Part of Troops Stationed in North China; Upholding Treaty Rights in China; US Position Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The British Embassy here notified the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, stating that due to the needs in Europe, a large part of the British troops in North China has been withdrawn. However, the French Embassy has not yet sent a similar notification to the Foreign Ministry. According to the French Embassy to the United Press reporter, the embassy has not yet received instructions from Paris on this point. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Hong Kong Army Department announced that a part of the British troops in Tianjin and Shanghai will be withdrawn, but the Hong Kong side will not be affected, and the number of troops stationed will not change. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Officials here, including Secretary of State Hull, told reporters yesterday that although Britain and France are withdrawing a part of their troops stationed in China, the US Far East policy will not change. When reporters asked whether the United States would increase or decrease the strength of its troops stationed in China because of the troop withdrawal by Britain and France, Hull replied, "Our policy is the same as before." Reporters further asked whether the United States intended to transfer troops stationed in the Philippines to China. Hull replied that he knew nothing about the plan. Hull continued that there were no plans to increase the number of US troops stationed in China to replace the withdrawing British and French troops. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: People close to the Chinese Embassy here, although dissatisfied with the withdrawal of a part of the British and French troops stationed in China, are not surprised by the troop withdrawal, because Britain has assured China that its Far East policy has not changed, and Britain has not "sold out" China. British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie recently stated solemnly to the Japanese side during talks held in Tokyo that the British troop withdrawal does not include sacrificing the rights and interests obtained under the treaties signed with China. (13th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The "Daily Telegraph" political reporter learned that the British government's decision to withdraw a part of its troops stationed in North China applies to Tianjin. The flooding of the Tianjin camp is one of the reasons for this decision. The damage to the Tianjin camp would cost 10,000 British pounds to repair. The conditions in the camp are not suitable for stationing troops, especially as the severe winter is approaching. The reason why the British government delayed its decision to withdraw a part of the British troops stationed in Tianjin until today is that early troop withdrawals might cause misunderstandings that Britain was forced to withdraw troops. It is now felt that British-Japanese relations can prevent this from being misunderstood, so this decision was made. Officials also firmly stated that this move does not abandon any principles or hinder other treaty countries. At the same time, this move may be regarded as an expression of Britain's willingness to acknowledge any friendly gestures made by Japan. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: "The Times" today published a letter signed by Lindsey Biffle Richie Ross and Lowe, discussing the issue of British Far East policy. First, they praised the American government for the statesmanlike manner in which it used the remarks made by its ambassador to Japan, Grew. They continued that Grew's remarks were expressed in a friendly and firm manner, and his words were in their hearts and could represent the psychology of the British people. They should make the American government sure that Britain is on the same position as the United States on this matter. They can welcome the Prime Minister's statement to the Japanese people, stating that Britain has no grievances against the Japanese people, but they should also specifically state that Britain will not give up the principles it advocates, such as adhering to the basic obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty and maintaining the integrity and independence of China. This is one of the principles. Britain should spare no effort to support the United States, otherwise the United States' ability and confidence may be affected, and seeds of long-term harassment will germinate in the Far East. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese "Kōchi Shimbun" commented on the British government's decision to withdraw a part of its troops stationed in North China, stating that Britain's reduction of its troops stationed in China seems to be at least partially in accordance with the wishes expressed by Japan two months ago. Britain claims that this move is for factual reasons and did not mention Japan's hope that the European belligerents would withdraw their naval and land forces stationed in China. However, no matter what its motives are, the result is the same. This can only be helpful to British-Japanese relations. The "Asahi Shimbun" London dispatch stated that the British troops in North China will be reduced to one hundred or one hundred and fifty people. It is expected that Britain will also withdraw troops from Shanghai and other places. The duties left by the British troops will be taken over by the US troops, because this is in accordance with the agreement that has been established between Britain and the United States. According to this agreement, the British rights in China will be taken care of by the United States. (14th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Saionji Worried About Japan's International Status; Adopting a Moderate Offensive Against the Powers; Anti-American Propaganda Disappears Again</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The "Kokumin Shimbun" newspaper declared today that Japan's last remaining Genro, Saionji, is quite worried about Japan's position both internationally and domestically. He will meet with Prime Minister Abe to discuss national affairs. According to reports, Saionji and Abe have never met. (14th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to observers here today, the Japanese government and the military will adopt a "moderate offensive" policy towards third countries in China. The purpose of this move by the Japanese government is to quickly end the Sino-Japanese War, deal with US economic retaliation, and plan to profit from the new world trade situation after the outbreak of this European war. Observers paid close attention to the changes in Japanese newspaper opinion in the past few days. Japanese newspapers previously published anti-American remarks in a prominent position, saying that "even if it is forced, Japan will never back down an inch in confronting the United States." Now, they have reversed their past attitude and no longer make attacks against the United States. The Japanese side announced in Shanghai yesterday that the "Nanjing government" under Japanese control is now trying to improve relations with foreign clergy in the Nanjing area, which is a sign of Japan's attempt to improve relations with third countries. The Japanese business community here believes that Japan's status as a neutral country in the current world market will be far more profitable than what it can gain in China.

<h3>Chongqing Municipal Government Conducts Anti-Smuggling Work; He Guoguang Issues Strict Prohibition on Goods Entering the Territory; Weng Wenhao Discusses the Deteriorating Economic Situation in Japan</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chongqing Municipal Government, in order to carry out anti-smuggling work, convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies and organizations today, deciding to establish the Chongqing Anti-Smuggling Committee. Representatives present and county magistrates from neighboring counties all serve as committee members, with He Guoguang as the chairman. Internally, it is divided into four groups: General Affairs, Storage, Inspection, and Appraisal. Responsible agencies and organizations were nominated on the spot to initiate the work. The inspection work is limited from the 14th to the 16th of the month, and the appraisal work is limited from the 17th to the 19th of the month. The Social Bureau will dispatch personnel to thoroughly inspect all major transportation routes, streets, and shops, starting from the 14th. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese government issued a public notice today stating that anyone who imports Japanese goods from occupied areas in the future will be sentenced to death. This will be implemented uniformly in all areas under the authority of the Chinese government. Chongqing Mayor He Guoguang specifically issued a notice to Chongqing merchants and residents regarding this matter, urging them not to treat their lives as a game. The municipal government is determined to strictly enforce the government's intention to ban Japanese goods. Before He Guoguang issued the notice, he convened a special meeting of responsible officials from various police stations, military police inspectors, customs personnel, the military, youth corps, and members of the Chamber of Commerce, immediately establishing an anti-smuggling committee, with He Guoguang as chairman. Afterward, He Guoguang received 40 representatives from various industries, informing them of the government's determination to ban smuggled goods, hoping that all sectors would voluntarily hand over all Japanese goods to the government before November 16th. According to officials speaking to the Associated Press, the dumping of Japanese goods in China has recently made inroads into areas under the control of the Chinese government. This is the latest form of economic offensive by the Japanese side. Therefore, the strict measures currently set by the government are nothing more than an economic counter-attack by China. It is also said that there are many routes for importing Japanese goods into the Chinese mainland, and many Japanese goods have counterfeit trademarks, places of origin, and manufacturers' names, claiming to be Chinese domestic goods. Some of these goods are imported without paying customs duties. Furthermore, the "Anti-Smuggling Committee" established today, together with the military authorities, has started working today. Japanese goods in Chongqing commercial firms are all subject to search and confiscation. (14th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao, speaking to the Associated Press today, the recent large-scale dumping of Japanese goods in the world market with words such as "Made in China" and other counterfeit trademarks is due to the extremely poor economic situation in Japan and the urgent need for foreign exchange. According to Dr. Weng, Japanese goods are widely promoted in the Philippines, all labeled with words such as "Made in China." The Japanese side's unscrupulous dumping policy, adopting illegal actions, fully demonstrates its poor economic situation. What we are currently concerned about is how to prevent losses suffered by buyers of Japanese goods. Last December, we published two types of lists: a list of Japanese trademarks and a list of Japanese-controlled factories in occupied areas. If various agencies need these forms, they can obtain them from Chinese chambers of commerce and consulates in various places. At the same time, inquiries regarding whether goods are truly domestic products can also be made to Chinese chambers of commerce and consulates in various places. (14th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Mail Ship "Sena Dana" Sunk by Mine in Singapore Bay; Over a Hundred Chinese Passengers Luckily Escape</h3>
<p>Singapore: The British-Indian mail ship "Sena Dana" (7,745 tons) struck a mine in Singapore Bay yesterday, causing the ship to sink within fifteen minutes. Eleven Asian passengers on deck, mostly children, have died, and nine passengers are still missing. The ship was carrying 137 deported Chinese, mostly confined in the front cabin, separated by iron bars. When the ship encountered danger, the guards managing these people urgently tried to open the iron gate. Thus, the confined Chinese were able to rush out when seawater entered the cabin and escape by lifeboat. The famous American magician Nicholas and his wife and members of the magic troupe were returning home on this ship after performing in Australia and the Far East. Although they were all fortunately rescued, hundreds of tons of their equipment, luggage, and decorations were lost. Nicholas told a Reuters reporter afterward that he and his wife jumped onto the last small boat as the ship was sinking.

As far as our Czechoslovak nation is concerned, the entire nation is spiritually united and carrying out the movement to restore the country. I can say that our country will one day see the light again. At this time, we will not make any demands. Once peace is restored, we hope that our country's final border line can be drawn by a majority of experts. These experts must recognize that the Czech Republic can be self-sufficient in agriculture and industry. In short, for the sake of establishing lasting peace in the world, this is an immortal undertaking, and our Czechoslovak country is also prepared to contribute. We will gladly accept all decisions that can be treated equally." (14th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Finnish Foreign Minister Indicates Willingness to Negotiate with the Soviet Union; Stalemate in Opinions; Submitted for Discussion by All Parties</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko recently met with journalists and, when talking about the delegation's return from Moscow, said that negotiations had made no progress for five days, and the government needed to re-engage with the delegation, so it recalled the delegation. Finland still maintains a positive attitude and does not want to stop negotiations indefinitely, and plans to continue to find ways to express goodwill. The government has already allowed the national delegation to return from Moscow to submit a report on the negotiation process. At that time, the government will notify the parliamentary party groups of the demands made by the Soviet Union. It is true that Soviet newspapers have been wantonly attacking our country in recent days, but this has nothing to do with our delegation's return. To understand, to obtain accurate and satisfactory results, the delegation will go to Moscow again after its report. The Soviet Union's proposal and Finland's counter-proposal will be submitted to the parliamentary groups for discussion, but they are not intended to be made public. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Foreign Minister Erkko recently told the newspaper that our country has always maintained a compromising attitude, and will continue to do so in the future.

<p>Moscow: The Communist Party's newspaper Pravda recently published news from the capital of Finland, saying that the entire country has become a fortress and economic life has come to a standstill.

President Smetona has instructed Vilnius District Commissioner Mackevičius to form a coalition government of the Christian Democratic Social Democratic parties. (14th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital: The formation of a new Lithuanian government is difficult to achieve at this time.

<h3>No Strikes or Work Stoppages Allowed in the British Wartime Coal Industry</h3>
<p>London: Representatives of coal mine owners and miners in Lancashire and Cheshire, England, recently met in Manchester and resolved that there should be no strikes or work stoppages during the war and for six months after the armistice. When discussing the British unemployment situation, Minister of Labor Bevin said that the increase in the number of temporary unemployed is unavoidable when the state of peace turns into a state of war. The transition is faster now than in 1914, and the increase in the number of unemployed is not as large as in 1914. As for people between the ages of sixteen and sixty-four, there are also more than in 1914. It is expected that the demand for labor needed for wartime purposes will soon surge. Bevin elaborated on the importance of organizing free organizations to integrate labor and capital, saying that labor and capital sometimes have disputes, but once the points of contention are thoroughly understood and a compromise is reached, both sides will be determined to work with everything. The effectiveness of this is far beyond what can be achieved by forced industry. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>If the Appeals of the Netherlands and Belgium Fail, They Will Still Seek Other Paths; Dutch Prime Minister Issues Statement; US Minister Calls on Dutch Queen</h3>
<p>The Hague: Dutch Prime Minister De Geer said in a broadcast speech today that if the peace appeals of the monarchs of Belgium and the Netherlands fail, the heads of state of Belgium, the Netherlands, and other countries will take new steps within a certain period of time. The dawn of Europe must come from neutral countries. The more countries that maintain neutrality, the greater the possibility of saving Europe from destruction. The military measures taken by the Netherlands near the border are not because the danger has increased, but because of precautionary measures. There is no reason to spread rumors of the Netherlands' imminent danger overseas. These rumors seem to be caused by news spread by foreign radio and newspapers and certain actions of the Dutch government. The danger is no greater now than when the Dutch defense forces were fully mobilized in early September. (13th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Berlin: Germany's reply to the peace telegrams from King Leopold of Belgium and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands has been drafted. It is expected that this reply will be delivered simultaneously in The Hague and Brussels today.

<h3>Japanese Troops from Shuyang Ambushed En Route to Suqian</h3>
<p>Chinese Troops Obtain Large Quantities of Military Supplies</p>
<p>Over one hundred Japanese soldiers from Suqian were ordered to Shuyang to reinforce. On the afternoon of the first, they returned to Sucheng via Hanji from Shuyang. After receiving a report, Commander of the × District Team of the Chinese Army, Mr. So-and-so, supervised over one hundred soldiers from the ××× and ××× detachments, together with the × Company of the ×× Battalion of the Regular Army, to ambush in the Zhaozhuang area. When the Japanese troops passed through the area, they launched a joint attack. The Japanese troops also returned fire at the Chinese army. The two sides held out for four hours.

Sun Zhuang on the south bank of the Xintao River was originally controlled by the ×× Team of Xinxing Township, but temporarily left their position due to the threat of Japanese bombing. Zhao Binwu of the × Company arrived with the × Detachment. The Japanese and puppet troops were crossing the river when they were killed by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops then retreated back to Henan and stubbornly resisted by the embankment. In the evening, the ×× Company of the Chinese Army arrived and rushed to reinforce the Longyan and Xintao River lines. The Japanese and puppet troops then fled in different directions towards Suqian and Shucheng. In this battle, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered seven casualties, while the Chinese side suffered one casualty.</p>

<p>Also, in October, the Chinese army also reported frequent victories, as follows: (1) The Japanese army entrenched in Wenling and Longfa in Qiongshan County were besieged by the Chinese army for many days and were terrified. At 7:00 p.m. on the 3rd, the 1st Company of the 1st Battalion of the 15th Regiment of the Chinese Security Team, together with the local guerrilla team, took advantage of the night of strong winds and heavy rain to rush into Wenlingshi. The Japanese army could not hold on and collapsed in a disheveled manner. At the same time, Battalion Commander Wu personally led the 2nd and 3rd Companies to pursue Longfa fiercely. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and fled in panic. The cities of Wenling and Longfa were simultaneously recovered by the Chinese army. When the Japanese army collapsed, a company of the Chinese army, together with the 4th Brigade of the guerrilla team, advanced along the small roads and ambushed them on the small roads from Sanpo to Yidong and from Wenling to Longfa. Battalion Commander Wu personally led the 2nd and 3rd Brigades to search and pursue along the main road. At the eastern end of Dali, they encountered twelve Japanese armored vehicles and more than a hundred infantrymen. They then dispatched the 2nd Company to detour along the Beichangdu Highway and advance along the Lingjiao Meiguan to meet the enemy, in order to achieve a pincer attack. He personally led the 3rd Company to pursue from behind with the most fierce firepower. Because the Japanese army was pressured from the front and rear, they only resisted for half an hour before boarding the vehicles and fleeing north. (2) At 5:00 p.m. on the 5th, dozens of Japanese troops from Xinglongshi in Wanning County invaded the villages of Huangzhu and Dapo near the city in an attempt to plunder food. They were ambushed by the Chinese teams and local armed civilians along the way. After a period of fierce fighting, more than a dozen were wiped out, and the rest fled in a disheveled manner. Several soldiers of the Chinese army were killed. After the Japanese army suffered a disastrous defeat, they became enraged and burned dozens of civilian houses along the way. (3) At noon on the 7th, the Chinese team ambushed and intercepted a Japanese military vehicle at the Guanzhan Bridge near Longgunshi, killing several people and destroying a vehicle. Three soldiers of the Chinese army were injured, but they destroyed the bridge and returned to their original positions. (4) At 9:00 a.m. on the 9th, dozens of Japanese infantry engineers from Wenchang County went to Lingcun Bridge on the Wenqing Highway to repair the bridge. The Chinese team, which had been ambushing in advance, launched a surprise attack, killing more than a dozen people on the spot. The Japanese army from Qinglan heard the alarm and arrived to aid. The Chinese army, having achieved its goal, retreated to its original defense. Only a few soldiers of the Chinese army were injured. (5) At dawn on the 7th, the Chinese army took advantage of the heavy fog to launch a surprise attack on the Japanese troops in the cities of Baoluoxiwei in Wenchang County. When they rushed into the city streets, the Japanese army fought back in a panic for an hour, then collapsed towards the cities of Sanjiang and Puqian. In this battle, more than a dozen people were killed, and a large number of military supplies were seized. The Chinese side suffered only a few casualties, six villagers were killed, and dozens of shops were burned. (6) On the 11th, 12th, and 13th, the Japanese army in Maihaoshi, Wenchang County, repeatedly harassed the villages of Songshuling and Jiusuocen. They were all ambushed and routed by the Chinese army, killing more than a dozen people. (7) On the night of the 9th, the Chinese army divided into two routes to besiege the Japanese army in Jiajishi, Qiongdong County. One route attacked the Japanese camp from the north gate, and the other route attacked the puppet maintenance association from the south gate. Both routes rushed into the urban area at the same time and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. The Japanese army relied on fortifications and it was difficult to capture them. The Chinese army destroyed the puppet maintenance association and killed more than thirty Japanese and puppet troops before retreating to their original defense. In this battle, more than ten soldiers of the Chinese army were injured. Since the Japanese army in the city was attacked by the Chinese army, a great panic has arisen. The general traitors and obedient people have fled one after another. The Taito Company and the liquor company, which were opened by the Japanese army in the city, have closed and ceased operations. The situation is extremely embarrassing. (8) On the morning of the 21st, more than a hundred Japanese troops from Yongxingshi in Qiongshan County invaded Anrenshi in the county and were severely attacked head-on by the Chinese army. Another unit was dispatched to outflank and intercept the Japanese army on the side. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army could not hold on and left behind many corpses and fled in panic. They were intercepted again by the Chinese armed civilians along the way. In order to vent their anger, the Japanese army burned more than two hundred civilian houses along the way. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and the Chinese army suffered slight losses. (9) On the 25th, more than two hundred Japanese troops from Naliu and Fengying in Qiongshan County invaded the cities of Shishan and Daotang in different routes and were ambushed by the Chinese reinforcements, suffering a disastrous defeat and fleeing in panic.

<h3>Japanese Army in Jiangyin Forcibly Orders Puppet Government to Repair Roads</h3>
<p>Streets in the City are Also Widened</p>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The Japanese army in Jiangyin regards the highway as its transportation line. The bridges and road surfaces on the Zhencheng Highway had long been destroyed by the Chinese army, and the Xicheng Road was also frequently attacked. The Japanese army could not repair them. Now, it has ordered the puppet provincial government to order the puppet county governments to add engineering personnel to specialize in repairing bridges and roads on the transportation line, and to store sufficient materials to avoid temporary emergencies. However, without funds, it is just empty talk. Even if they are repaired, they can be destroyed at any time, which is a waste of effort.</p>

<h3>A Glimpse into Talent Supply and Demand in Shanghai Two Years After the War (5)</h3>
<p>Pan Wenan, Zheng Wenhan, Shen Guanglie</p>
<p>Demand for Talent</p>
<p>Opportunities for talent can be seen from Table 6. In the past year, the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center was entrusted to find a total of 2,027 people, which is equivalent to more than four-fifths of the number of job seekers. Compared with the year before and after the war, there was an increase in opportunities. On the surface, it seems easier to find employment. In fact, the success rate of introductions is not much different from before (see Table 9). Among them, many are indeed due to unsuitable talents, but the main reason is that employers take advantage of the severe unemployment situation and excessively lower the wages. If we study by gender analysis, the opportunities for men account for 77.26%, while the opportunities for women account for 22.74%. Judging by the numbers alone, there are more opportunities for men. However, according to the analysis of the number of job seekers, the number of male job seekers accounts for 82.1%, while women only account for 17.9%. In proportion, the opportunities for men are slightly rarer than those for women, and the competitiveness between men and women may be equal.</p>

<h3>Important Changes to the Rules of This Year's West Youth Basketball Tournament Invitation Letters Issued Yesterday Little Bears and Giants Have Signed Up to Join</h3>
<p>The 12th West Youth Invitational Basketball League is scheduled to kick off on the 5th of next month. Registration will close on the 20th of this month. This year, it is divided into Group A and Group B. The competition adopts a single round-robin system. The registration fee is 50 yuan for Group A and 35 yuan for Group B. Each team must also pay a security deposit of 15 yuan. The American basketball rules adopted by the league have several important changes this season (1939-40). The ticket price for this year has been decided to be 1 yuan (courtside) and 5 jiao (upstairs), and the price has also been increased. The invitation letter for the competition was distributed to the teams that participated in the previous session yesterday (the absence of China United and Duwo). The Little Bears and Giants of West Youth have signed up to join. According to the invited teams, some have changed their names and some have disbanded, so it is difficult to meet the quota. Therefore, if there are any teams that have not received an invitation letter but want to join, they can contact the Sports Department of the Association. According to the Sports Director of the Association, Mr. Gao Guoguang, the referee for this competition will still be assigned by the Shanghai Branch of the American Basketball Referees Association. The translated changes to the competition and the names of the invited teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Rule Changes</p>
<p>(1) The distance between the blocking plate and the baseline is 4 feet (the old rule was 2 feet). If the length of the court is insufficient, it can be changed. The maximum and most ideal court length for university team games is 94 feet, and the distance between the two blocking plates is 86 feet. (2) After a technical foul free throw, regardless of whether the free throw is made or not, the team making the free throw throws the ball out of bounds at the center line (the old rule was a jump ball in the center circle). When a personal foul is penalized, the captain of the fouled team may give up the right to free throw and instead have a teammate throw the ball out of bounds at the center line (the old rule had no right). If it is a series of free throws, it only applies to the last free throw. Double fouls are not included in this case. (3) If a player is fouled from behind or rudely dragged from any direction while throwing the ball, regardless of whether the ball is thrown or not, two free throws will be awarded (the old rule was one free throw after the throw). (4) Any player can request a timeout, and it is no longer limited to the captain having this right. (5) In overtime, each team can request one more timeout for each overtime period (the old rule was that each team could request five timeouts for each game, regardless of whether the game was overtime or not. Exceeding this limit would result in a technical foul). (6) Section 9 of Article 14 removes the words "or blocking plate" (the old rule stipulated that if the free throw was inaccurate, the basketball or blocking plate would be thrown out of bounds by the other party). In addition, there are many changes in wording, but there is not much difference from the original meaning.</p>

When the market opened in the afternoon, exporters continued to sell, which made it harder to reach 5 pence 25. However, HSBC still had an appetite for the upper price, and American banks also followed suit with a strong intention to buy, which tightened again to 5 pence 1875 and 8 and a half yuan. After entering the market, rumors spread that a new Sino-US loan had been established, and Hong Kong electricity came again to sell, which eventually led to fatigue.

<p>At the beginning of the afternoon market, exporters sold spot British gold to HSBC, which hardened to 5 pence 25. At that time, a certain bank and Datong had a slight appetite for buying, so the market situation softened to 5 pence 1875 and 8 and a half yuan.

<h3>Hong Kong Gang Stops Entering The Gold Market Plunges Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot crude gold off-market situation still hardly escaped the tired situation, and the plunging trend gradually intensified. In fact, the exchange rate was loose and the Hong Kong procurement quota turned less, so the general retail investors considered the environment to be poor and unfavorable to the multi-party. If they had goods in hand, they were extremely willing to close out at any time with a small profit, but a certain speculator was still adding chips when the price was low, but he could not pull it alone. At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate took a hard lead and fell by 18 yuan to open at 3,690 yuan. However, although the exchange rate continued to report hard afterwards, the Hong Kong gang temporarily absorbed a huge amount, and the selling trend had eased slightly. In a flash, it returned to a high of 3,718 yuan. However, the good times did not last long, and the Hong Kong gang stopped entering. In addition, the exchange rate continued to be loose. It was also heard that a certain gold shop that had previously absorbed for the Hong Kong gang suddenly released more floating profits, so it was pressed down to 3,675 yuan. Although it rebounded slightly afterwards, it was still only 3,680 yuan at the noon closing. The market opened again in the afternoon and fell to a low of 3,650 yuan. The reason was that the exchange rate continued to harden and a certain money exchange firm sold again. Fortunately, the exchange rate had turned tight and soft, and a certain gold shop also vigorously entered hundreds of taels on behalf of speculators, rising by 25 yuan. In the end, the exchange rate was loose and people's hearts were difficult to boost. 3,662 yuan became the closing price of the day. As a result, it tragically fell by 46 yuan compared with the end of last week. The whole day's transactions were still strong, about 1,500 taels. The gold ornaments in the silver shop were listed at 5 yuan, and the customs gold was still flat.</p>
<p>Crude gold fell by 46 yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels) fell by 18 yuan when it was heard that the exchange rate was taking a hard lead and people's hearts were slightly tired. The securities gang sold 20 taels to a certain gold shop, for 3,690 yuan. Afterwards, although the exchange rate still reported hard, the Hong Kong gang suddenly entrusted a certain gold shop and a certain money exchange firm to absorb more than 500 taels, so the general retail investors who sold out turned less. Soon, it rose by 28 yuan. The money exchange firm entered 20 taels for the silver shop gang, for 3,718 yuan. After that, the Hong Kong gang stopped entering, and the exchange rate was still on a loose path. In addition, the silver shop gang and the money exchange firm rushed to sell out, so they could not support the downward trend. The silver shop gang sold 10 taels to the gold shop, for 3,675 yuan. Then, the exchange rate once turned soft and the wind rose again, rising by 20 yuan. The money exchange firm entered 50 taels for the securities gang, for 3,695 yuan. At that time, the exchange rate reported loosening again, and a certain gold shop that had previously entered on behalf of the Hong Kong gang suddenly left the cage, so the decline was seen again, falling by 15 yuan. The money exchange firm sold 10 taels to the securities gang, for 3,680 yuan as the noon closing price. At the beginning of the afternoon, it was 5 yuan less. A certain money exchange firm sold 20 taels to the gold shop, for 3,675 yuan. Later, because the exchange rate was quite hard, and a certain money exchange firm came out again, it continued to fall by 25 yuan. The silver shop gang sold 30 taels to the securities gang, for 3,650 yuan. At that time, the exchange rate suddenly softened, and a certain gold shop vigorously entered hundreds of taels on behalf of speculators, so it rose by 25 yuan. A certain gold shop entered 20 taels for the money exchange firm, for 3,675 yuan. After entering, the exchange rate suddenly hardened again, and a certain Yu shop had enough to eat, so the falling trend started again, falling by 15 yuan. The silver shop gang sold 50 taels to the gold shop, for 3,660 yuan. Later, the money exchange firm sold 10 taels to the gold shop, for 3,662 yuan as the closing price. As a result, it was 46 yuan less than the end of last week. The whole day's price fluctuated by 68 yuan. The selling price of the current gold shop's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher than that of crude gold, and the purchase price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry gold is listed at 5 yuan less</p>
<p>At the beginning, the exchange price of gold jewelry in silver shops was still 375 yuan, but at 3:00 PM, it was listed at 5 yuan less. As a result, the exchange price of gold jewelry in silver shops was changed to 370 yuan, which was the same as the previous price, and the purchase price was reduced by 15 yuan.</p>

<h3>Securities Domestic Debt Excited, Foreign Stocks Watchful</h3>
<p>The off-market situation of securities suddenly turned around yesterday. The shorts were still pressing at the beginning, but the market price was once pressed down due to the surge of entrants and short covering, which immediately caused a reaction. At the same time, the market rumored that Sino-US fathers had a new loan. How true this is is unknown, but the long-oppressed people were excited by this, and the market price rose. Unfortunately, the news may not be true, so the closing price tended to be a small number of jiao. At the beginning of yesterday, Yichang sold according to the market price, and the market price rose by 2 or 3 jiao. Soon, buyers surged, and Dafeng Jiufeng No. 5 and No. 20, as well as Runli Lianhe, all bought. The noon closing turned from falling to rising. In the afternoon, Changji covered 38 and 50, and there was also demand. Dafeng transferred out, and Shunheng Hongda also sold out, but the price remained strong. Category C broke through 7 yuan again. As a result, the market price rose by a few jiao to 1 yuan and 2 jiao compared with the previous day. However, the market price suddenly fell by about 2 or 3 jiao after the closing. The transaction volume was about 1 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock market transactions, 50 shares of Dachina Match Company were traded at a price of 17 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market transactions in the afternoon at the Public Industry Office were not characteristic due to the short time. The public's interest was extremely low. Speculators seemed to be waiting for the arrival of the new account on Thursday to determine their actions. Stock prices were no different from before. Only in terms of industrial stocks, some showed more selling than buying when the price rose slightly. Rubber stocks were slightly soft.</p>
<p>The board of directors of Siniwang Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by Huitong Foreign Firm in this port, decided yesterday to pay an interim dividend of 3 yuan per share in national currency for the year ending January 1940, and decided to suspend stock transfer from November 20 to 25.</p>

The rest was flat.</p>
<p>London, 13th Telegram, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable today, and all public bonds in the upper and lower ranges were free from honor or disgrace.</p>
<h3>Gauze Flowers: Coarse Yarn Sales Strong, Factory Openings Also Substantial</h3>
<p>Yarn Market: Entering a state of calm, but overseas markets are actually rising gradually, leading to a solid foundation for raw cotton. This is why people are optimistic. Although actual sales are not booming, Hong Kong merchants have a strong appetite for 10-count coarse yarn and are eager to procure it, with large orders placed directly with factories. However, the purchase of fine yarn remains weak, hence the market presents a picture of fine yarn being flat and coarse yarn being firm.</p>
<p>This morning, yarn merchants gathered to discuss the market, saying that 200 to 300 bales of coarse yarn from Guangdong were shipped in yesterday before the border closure, mostly sold by factories. Sentiment was still stable. Subsequently, as drafts were issued, the exchange rate rose again, dampening the mood. 20-count Shuangma yarn was quoted at 645-646 yuan, but sales in Guangdong were still lacking. However, fellow merchants, seeing the rise in overseas cotton markets, were optimistic and bought another 200-300 bales, pushing the market price back up by 2-3 yuan to 649 yuan. Statistics show that 1,445 bales were traded in half a day, compared to 575 bales yesterday. The price of 20-count Shuangma was down by 5 jiao, while Tiannv Shuangdiqiu was unchanged, with little difference from yesterday's price. Factories reported that Yong'an Factory sold 250 bales of 10-count Te Jincheng at 555 yuan, Tongyi Factory sold 120 bales of Jinji at 518 yuan, Chongxin Factory sold 120 bales of 10-count Dafa at 518 yuan, and Zhenhua Factory sold 100 bales of 18-count Shuanglong at 585 yuan. Today, 320 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai, 180 pieces to Tianjin, and 10 pieces to Singapore. The amounts purchased by various merchants are listed below:</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Looking Good, Merchants Actively Searching for Purchases</h3>
<p>Trading in local cotton is still developing, and merchants are particularly active. The market is discussing optimistic psychological expectations, the reason being the unanimous rise in European and American cotton markets, believing that Chinese cotton has a firm footing. Therefore, they predict that the future will be more upward than downward. Otherwise, it would have jumped long ago. Fortunately, the US exchange rate is increasing daily. The relationship between the loosening of the exchange rate and the price of cotton is very close. If the US dollar rises by half a yuan and the price of US cotton remains unchanged, the calculated price per dan would be more than ten cheaper. From Northern Jiangsu, a total of 2,000 bales of Tonghua and 1,189 bales of Changyinsha were delivered. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left (transaction price for factory purchases includes delivery and drying, merchants are trading at the docks):</p>
<p>Another report on the Shanghai foreign cotton trade indicates that it has become quiet again in recent days. Yarn factories, seeing no improvement in yarn sales, have no intention of purchasing raw cotton for the time being. Merchants, having been silent for a long time, are eager to move and are quite interested in purchasing 42-count raw cotton. However, due to the instability of the exchange rate, they can only wait and see for now.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market has been particularly strong recently. It rose yesterday morning due to purchases by speculators. Cloth sales are becoming more smooth daily, thereby arousing purchases from merchants and the public. Spot trading is unusually active, which is the main reason for the rise. Later, short sellers covered their positions in the near term, resulting in the closing price for the near term rising more than ten points compared to the previous day, and the far term rising three or four points. The Indian market is closed, predicting a rise of more than five rupees. The Egyptian market is closed, and Liverpool is up ten pence.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Sporadic, Ningbo Shipments Still Strong</h3>
<p>Due to the weak actual sales in all regions, the cloth market has seen a slight drop in sales prices. White coarse cloth and coarse twill are down by 5 fen to 2 jiao per bolt, while fine cloth and fine twill are down by 1-2 jiao. The asking prices for bleached, dyed, and printed cloths are unchanged, with some down by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. The prices of various flannels are also trending weaker, as market inventories are sufficient, customer demand is sporadic, and retail stores are slightly less active due to seasonal factors. This street saw transactions of over 200 bales of white coarse cloth and fine twill, and over 100 boxes of colored cloth, bleached cloth, printed goods, and flannels. Yunnan merchants purchased 50-60 boxes of printed cloth, serge, Zhigong floral cloth, woolen cloth, and Prussian blue cloth. Fujian merchants purchased 40-50 boxes of colored twill and woolen cloth. Ningbo merchants purchased 100+ bales of coarse and fine cloth, and 40-50 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, printed flannel, bleached cloth, and silk gauze. Recently, with the Wenzhou shipping route often obstructed, the shipment of goods on the Shanghai-Ningbo line has become even more congested.</p>
<h3>Grains: Japonica Rice Supply Still Not Weak, Traders Profiting from Manipulating 客秈, Various Rice Market Prices Rise First Then Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday's grain supply from various merchants: none arrived from Hexia, and more than ten carts of goods from Suzhou, Tongkun, and Tai were transported by rail, eight or nine carts of goods from Qingsi and Fengjia, and one or two thousand bags transferred from Changbang goods Shanchaibao and Hupukou were still not huge. Regarding the overall market situation, because of hoarding operations, the prices of various goods surged sharply. Yesterday, there were still aftereffects. General hoarders wanted to ensure the safety of the goods they had already purchased, and they also had thoughts of making profits, so they started searching again in the morning. Therefore, the prices were all raised by more than half a yuan by the merchants. A chaotic scene, not inferior to the previous market. Local customers, seeing the prices rising all the way, estimated that they had reached the top and were all wary, and did not dare to compete rashly. In addition to making some purchases for immediate needs, they all watched with their hands folded. Because the actual appetite was already small, hoarders could not do anything, so the sales yard turned dull near noon, and the market declined steadily. Except that the rise in 客秈 was particularly large and the decline was also less, the situation regarding new japonica and 蘆羊尖 was similar. For example, Chang Tejing opened at 32.5, and the closing price was only 2.23 yuan better at 31.23 yuan. Te Lujian went from 29 yuan to 28.78 jiao, Te Jing went from 28.5 yuan to 28.23 jiao, and Nangang early rice went from 29 yuan to 28.67 jiao, second grade 27.8 jiao. Du Yao 菉種 and Bianyuan, etc., because the way out has always been sporadic, yesterday in this environment, never insulted the ears from beginning to end.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Factory Disc Price Reduced by 1 Jiao Wheat Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>The current flour mill price has been changed to 7 yuan and 2 jiao, which is 1 jiao lower than last week. This is because recent customer sales have been quiet, and are even more affected by the dumping of domestic miscellaneous brand flour and Japanese flour, causing the political market to collapse. Although the factory price has been reduced yesterday, actual sales still feel lacking. In addition to this street's retail and daily transactions, customers have only made slight movements from Qingdao merchants, so Paoche flour still needs 7 yuan and 3 jiao, while the prices for Chechuan brand dock goods are 5 fen to 1 jiao different from the factory price. The market is still in a static and weak process.</p>
<p>The wheat market situation is trending towards rejection again. Although there have been arrivals in recent days, the number is not large. The factories and firms have unanimously been in a state of stagnation, and the suppliers are still unwilling to sell at low prices. Except for a few direct deliveries to factories, the formal market has stopped invisibly, it is said. 3,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin on the 15th, and 500 bags to Tangzhan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market remained sluggish. The guild set the price for coarse sand white old goods at 51.7 yuan, new goods at 52.7 yuan, and transshipment goods at 42 yuan, down 8 jiao from the previous day. Taikoo Chebai B mark was 56.1 yuan, H mark red was 40 yuan, and Dutch red was still 42 yuan. There were no changes in the rest. It was heard that a certain firm opened 800 bags of Zhang Diao domestic sugar at a price of 31 yuan in cash. 500 bags of Taikoo Sichuan wheel Huang Jiangqing arrived, and because the goods were of varying quality, the price was negotiated at 36 yuan. Dongxiang Red opened more than a hundred bags at a price of 34.5 yuan. 500 tons of Dutch sugar arrived in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Annam Shrimp Tails Present New Crop</h3>
<p>Annam shrimp tails have long been scarce in the market due to the transition between seasons. At this time of the autumn and winter equinox, the new crop has begun to appear. The first batch of goods arrived two days ago, fifteen boxes, and the identity and color are still good, then opened for sale, and the price is 215 yuan. Twenty-two pieces of winter mushrooms were shipped from Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal and Coal Balls Drop Again</h3>
<p>The price of coal balls has fallen due to the establishment of a certain factory in Pudong and price competition. The factory prices have been reduced. However, because the two sides cannot agree, and the new factory is using gifts as a selling point, each factory member of the machine-made coal ball industry has to sacrifice to the end in order to deal with it. After another drop, another collective meeting was held last night to reduce the factory price by another two yuan. It is estimated that Yitaixing, Nanyang, Guohua, and Dongfang's large factory coal balls will be delivered by fellow traders at 60 yuan per ton, and the small factory goods will be one or two yuan cheaper.</p>
<h3>Import and Export: Soybeans and Sesame Shipped to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 300 cans of raw oil were shipped from Qingdao. 600 bags of soybeans and 498 bags of sesame were exported to Singapore. 1,050 bags of soybeans were shipped to Penang. 320 pieces of Qing smoke and 8,760 pieces of paper came from Ningbo.</p>

<p>Aurora University</p>
<p>Aurora University and the Catholic Church in this city have decided to hold a Requiem Mass at 7:30 am today at St. Peter's Church on Luban Road to mourn the passing of Ma Xianglao, and are actively preparing for the memorial service. It is learned that the Mass to be held today will be the largest ever held, and all Catholics in this city are invited to participate, and music will be added during the Mass to show solemnity. The two bishops originally scheduled to preside over the ceremony, Zhu Xianmei from the Haimen District and Hui Jiliang from the Shanghai District, were unable to come to Shanghai due to matters. It has now been changed to Father Yao Zhanchen, the president of the Society of Jesus, to serve as the presiding priest, and Fathers Cai Ermeng and Qiao Dianai, two school directors, have also been designated as assistants.

The school also issued a public announcement stating that Ma Gongxiangbo had accumulated moral virtue and articles, led the masses, and was famous all over the world. At the age of 100, he ran thousands of miles and worked diligently for national affairs, and his voice shook the world. He was beneficial to the times in life and left a legacy after death. There is no need for us to say more. We, either because of the same school or the same religion, will temporarily put aside national affairs and discuss the contributions he made to Catholicism and the school, and it is impossible to not be moved or to not show it outwardly when we hear the bad news. Therefore, the two chairmen of the Alumni Association and the Catholic Action Association of Huixiao, in view of this, specially invited Dean Zhang of Xuhui College to hold a Requiem Mass at 8 am on the 17th of the month in the school's Immaculate Conception Chapel. We sincerely hope that all members will take the time to attend, pray together, and admire the legacy together.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes to Be Issued: Announcement to Be Made Imminently</h3>
<p>Rumors That It Has Already Been Shipped to Shanghai for Issuance: Purely Speculation from All Sides</p>
<p>After the Central Bank issued one-fen and five-fen fractional currency notes, the first batch of 500,000 yuan had already been issued. The second batch of 500,000 yuan was printed by the American Yongning Company and delivered in batches according to the contract. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has prepared to issue it in the short term and circulate it in the Shanghai market. The rumors that it has been shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai and that it is scheduled to be issued on the 21st are untrue. As for the date of issuance, the bank has not yet decided.</p>
<p>Lack of Dime Coins</p>
<p>Recently, dime coins have been in extremely short supply in the market, causing a few cigarette and exchange shops to suddenly increase the exchange rate for national currency to dime coins. Generally, one yuan of national currency can only be exchanged for 9 jiao and 9 fen of dime coins, and even less in remote locations. There are also those who refuse to exchange due to the lack of dime coins. Most shops require a purchase of 2 jiao or more when giving out dime coins for change. The aforementioned situation has caused extreme inconvenience for residents. According to Central Bank news, more than 2 million yuan of dime coins were exchanged during the previous issuance of the first batch of fractional currency notes. However, those who exchanged them mostly collected the new dime coins, so they were not widely circulated. It is said that the second batch of dime coins will be shipped to Shanghai in a few days, so there is no problem with the circulation of dime coins.</p>

<h3>German Consulate: Clarification and Denial</h3>
<p>Shanghai Special Dispatch from Haitian News Agency: Regarding the rumor spread by a certain news agency in this port that German nationals in Shanghai are withdrawing deposits from the Netherlands Bank, and that this move was a notice from the German Consulate, Haitian News Agency recently inquired with the German authorities in Shanghai and learned that this statement is completely inaccurate. The German Consulate General has never issued such a notice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the German Consul General in Shanghai sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday stating: "Dear Sir, today's issue of your newspaper carries a news item that 'German nationals in Shanghai withdrew huge sums of money from the Netherlands Bank in one day. This move by German nationals was due to a notice from the German Consulate in Shanghai.' This Consulate has never issued such a notice. We hereby inform your newspaper accordingly, and request that you investigate and correct it as soon as possible. Sincerely, [signed] Consul General Fischer, November 14."</p>
<h3>British Army Strengthens Defenses, Controls Yidingpan Road, Ensures Security in the Defense Zone to Prevent Future Troubles, Pseudo Police in the Shengs Ancestral Hall Have Moved In</h3>
<p>At the northeast corner of the intersection of Pingyuan Road and Yidingpan Road, the British Defense Forces demolished the previous defensive works yesterday and rebuilt them, with the western end reaching the sidewalk of Yidingpan Road, with a larger and stronger scope than before. The main reason for such a facility is to guard the northern end of Yidingpan Road. In the future, the defense of that area should be secure.</p>
<p>Sheng Shrine Occupied</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Sheng Ancestral Hall at No. 11 Jiesifeier Road, an extraterritorial road, has a huge building that was originally leased to the Hanyeping Coal Mining Company for use as a clubhouse. After August 13th, it was opened as a refugee shelter. This summer, two bamboo huts were added to the open space behind the building to open a children's middle school. Since September 9, after a part of the houses were occupied by the Japanese puppet military police, the situation has changed day by day. Refugees and children were uneasy, but they continued in a tense atmosphere for two months. Recently, the Japanese puppets attempted to expand their police power, expanded the "Shanghai West Police Sub-bureau" organization, and selected the giant building as the new location. Therefore, the refugee shelter and the children's middle school suffered the same fate and were forced to disband one after another, and the pseudo police sub-bureau moved in the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Building Basements</p>
<p>Currently, the interior is actively renovating the houses, building traffic roads, and transforming the basements for use as prisons. The sandbag defenses built at the entrance have been restored into concrete bunkers. The school buildings for children have also been demolished since yesterday. Pseudo police guarding the gate are prohibited from entering inside, and the rest live separately in the No. 3, 34, and 58 shelters of the Cilian Sub-Association, waiting for follow-up arrangements.</p>

<h3>Unauthorized Establishment of Courts by Jews: Numerous Drawbacks</h3>
<p>Chinese Legal Circles Have Already Criticized, European Lawyers Also Vehemently Oppose</p>
<p>According to the Mainland News, regarding the Shanghai Committee for the Assistance of European Jewish Refugees' recent establishment of a court, the legal advisor of the committee, Grossman, stated that the so-called "court" is only an arbitration committee organized by fifty people from the main foreign communities in Shanghai to complete matters publicly encouraged in accordance with Chinese adjudication procedures. It is expected that cases submitted for arbitration will be resolved in accordance with Chinese law and local customs. The spirit of the established articles of association is not to undermine China's sovereignty, but to cooperate with Chinese courts in adjudication. The articles of association also stipulate that arbitrators shall make all arbitration rulings through Chinese courts. However, at the same time, the arbitration court has been attacked from two sides. Chinese legal circles claim that the court is a deliberate attempt to undermine China's sovereignty, and eighteen European lawyers have also opposed the court. It is said that the articles of association were drafted solely by Grossman, with numerous drawbacks, and that the Refugee Committee clearly has no right to participate in adjudication matters.</p>
<h3>Japanese Information Minister Suma to Fly to Shanghai Today</h3>

<h3>Preparing for Next Year's People's Food: Grain Storage Is a Matter of Utmost Urgency, Work Bureau Chinese Directors Are Particularly Concerned</h3>
<p>Since the First Special District Citizens' Federation suggested that the authorities of the two concessions purchase food and establish warehouses for storage to meet regulatory needs, all sectors have hoped that this suggestion can be implemented. According to a certain industry leader, although the domestic food supply this year has been a good harvest, the occupied areas have been extensively purchased by a certain party, and the people's inventory has become apparently weak. Non-occupied areas, the National Government is also implementing wartime controls, to the extent that the supply of foreign rice, whether affected by the expansion of the European War, is also very difficult to know, so the food problem for the coming year, the establishment of no prior preparation, the future is more hidden worries, storing food against famine is a good strategy for regulating the people's food in our country's history, and now Shanghai has a population of 4 million, with more consumers than producers, the burden of living is increasing day by day, and the threat of food is apparent, so storing grain for regulatory purposes is a necessity, and it is hoped that all parties will work together to promote and implement it, which is the gospel of the people's food future, and the Chinese directors of the Work Bureau are also very concerned about this, and are studying and considering the suggestion of the City Federation.</p>

<h3>Nikka Asia Institute Publicly Controls Egg Purchases, Notifies Third-Country Merchants to Cease Operations, British and American Sides Planning Appropriate Response</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that among the foreign companies operating egg businesses in Shanghai, there are two American and five British firms. The Japanese side and the Nikka Asia Institute recently instructed Mitsui &amp; Co. to inform a certain company that an egg-packing company owned by a merchant from a third country must cease purchasing eggs to avoid hindering Japan's economic development in China. Mitsui &amp; Co. also notified another foreign egg-packing company that it must stop buying eggs because the egg trade must be controlled by Mitsui &amp; Co. It is reported that the value of eggs purchased by the seven British and American companies and forcibly seized by Mitsui &amp; Co. has reached 500,000 yuan. It is also said that the Nikka Asia Institute now requires "transport permits" for goods to be transported to Shanghai, which is another obstructive tactic by the Japanese side to prevent eggs purchased by the seven foreign companies at the mouth of the Yangtze River from being transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>When eggs are shipped from several Yangtze River ports, the Japanese side has already issued such permits. However, some ports are now no longer issuing permits. The result is that the Nikka Asia Institute is demanding permits that it has never issued. Currently, about 2,000 baskets of eggs are detained outside the North Railway Station by the seven foreign egg companies. According to these companies, after the Japanese side's massive seizure of 500,000 yuan worth of eggs, it is now adopting a strategy of making third-country companies feel intimidated from engaging in the egg business. Most of these companies are about to close down, but they are still purchasing a small number of eggs to continue working and resist coercion. Although Japan claims to want to improve relations with Britain and the United States, and the British and American consuls in Shanghai have repeatedly protested, Mitsui &amp; Co. has not abandoned its attempt to seize the entire trade of British and American companies. The British and American embassies in Tokyo have received reports and are currently considering the matter, but at the same time, the Japanese policy of encroachment in Shanghai continues.</p>
<h3>Second Meeting of Garrison Troops from Various Countries</h3>
<p>Discussion of Japanese Agenda Seems to Have No Result</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources yesterday, the Shanghai International Settlement's international defense plan was revised in 1934. On September 14th, Shishido, commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Force, convened a committee to revise the joint defense plan in his capacity as a defense committee member, gathering the commanders of the garrison troops from various countries stationed in Shanghai. Yesterday morning at 10:30, the second subcommittee meeting was held at the Naval Club. Attendees included Kurihara, senior staff officer of the Japanese Naval Landing Force; British Major Ashworth; American Lieutenant Colonel Stark; Lieutenant Sten; Italian Captain Bentiogli; and Merchant Corps Major Corbin. After various discussions on the issues raised by the Japanese side, a luncheon was held in a separate room at noon.</p>
<h3>British Withdrawal of Some Garrison Troops Does Not Mean Abandoning Interests in North China, Shanghai British Merchants Regret It as a Sign of Weakness, Frankly Tell Japanese Side Not to Cause Misunderstandings</h3>
<p>Since Britain decided to withdraw some of its garrison troops from North China, Chinese and foreign figures have paid close attention, especially British commercial firms with interests in North China. A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency visited many well-known British merchants in Shanghai yesterday to inquire about their opinions. Generally, they believed that the withdrawal of British troops from North China was not entirely unexpected. However, various parties inevitably have all sorts of complex feelings about this. The British government is certainly adopting what it considers to be a sound policy, but the Tianjin incident has not been resolved, and the Japanese army's blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin remains the same. Wouldn't the British army's withdrawal at this time be seen as a sign of weakness to the Japanese side? Some of them expressed a deep hope that the British garrison in North China would not be completely withdrawn, as reported by the telegram. Furthermore, the statement from Washington that the U.S. Marine Corps will increase its numbers to fully protect the interests of foreigners in North China was eagerly emphasized by most people. However, the manager of a certain British commercial firm in Shanghai, who has invested heavily in North China, replied to the reporter's inquiry, saying, "From my point of view, there is no reason to believe that the withdrawal of British troops in North China will affect British interests in that area." When the reporter asked whether, according to his argument, the British side was relying on the protection of the Japanese army in North China, the manager pondered for a moment and replied, "I hope the Japanese authorities do not think that the withdrawal of British troops is a sign of weakness or a decision to abandon British rights and interests in North China." However, another British merchant manager spoke frankly and directly told the reporter, "The presence of British troops in North China was certainly not intended for armed resistance against Japan. Except in critical moments when it was necessary to protect the interests of British nationals, they never displayed their weapons. However, the presence of British troops in North China was a kind of 'calming force' for the Japanese army. What I am worried about is that after the withdrawal of British troops, the Japanese side will easily misunderstand and want to think that this is an opportunity to seize all affairs in North China."</p>

<h3>Deadline for Exporting German Goods Stranded in Haiphong Has Been Officially Canceled, Can Still Be Expedited for Export Afterwards, Other Goods Can Pass Freely, Shanghai Post Office Not Responsible for German Goods Parcels</h3>
<p>Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce Announcement [Zhong Zi No. 39]: The current French government of Vietnam has stated that German goods purchased by Chinese merchants before the war and stranded in Haiphong can still be expedited for export after October. Please send the French consular visas (i.e., proof that the price has been fully paid before September 3rd) to Haiphong as soon as possible to facilitate the retrieval and shipment of goods. The previously announced departure deadline of October 30th for the French government of Vietnam's ban on the export of goods has now been canceled and is no longer restricted. Hereafter, all transit goods, except for German goods, can pass freely. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Urgent Instructions for Visa Processing</p>
<p>The Sino-French Express Company has received a telegram from the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce stating that for German, Austrian, and Czech goods stranded in Haiphong belonging to Chinese merchants, please inform the cargo owners to quickly request endorsements from the French consulate in the place of purchase, certifying that the German, Austrian, and Czech goods were indeed paid for before September 3rd of this year, and send this visa document to Haiphong to facilitate the retrieval of the goods and their transfer to the Chinese mainland. If cargo owners have any unclear procedures, they can inquire with China Travel Service or Sino-French South China Express Company and entrust them to handle all procedures on their behalf.</p>
<p>German Goods Parcels Prohibited from Transit</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration issued Announcement No. 15 yesterday, stating that because the Vietnamese government has prohibited the transit of German goods and items sent from or to German people, the sender is responsible for any parcels containing German goods and sent from or to German people via Vietnam. Furthermore, for domestic or international parcels transiting through Vietnam, a tax declaration list and a parcel delivery form must be included, clearly stating the contents of the parcel and the names and addresses of the sender and recipient to facilitate Vietnamese customs inspection. This is hereby announced for public knowledge. [Signed] Director Cha Peilin.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Kunming Intermodal Transport Increases Freight</p>
<p>Shanghai-Kunming intermodal transport of goods via Saigon, Vietnam, is very safe and fast. Now, Sino-French and Sino-South China Express Companies have had to slightly increase freight rates to maintain costs because French postal ships are charging more for water freight and Vietnamese railways are charging more for train freight, dramatically increasing the cost of land and sea intermodal transport. Starting from the 13th shipment, freight per ton will be increased by one-seventh of the original amount. At the same time, the conversion of Hong Kong dollars to legal tender will be calculated based on the opening exchange rate of Hong Kong dollar telegraphic transfers at the Shanghai HSBC on the customs settlement date.</p>
<h3>Slandered for Transporting National Goods to the Philippines, Personnel Sent to the Philippines to Explain, Newspaper Rumors Inaccurate Leading to Misunderstandings Among Overseas Chinese, National Goods Factories Unanimously Reject Japanese Materials</h3>
<p>Manila, in the Philippines, is a gathering place for overseas Chinese, and more than half of its commerce and finance is controlled by them. However, due to environmental restrictions, past import trade has mostly come from the United States, and it has not been possible to freely transport and sell goods from within the country. Recently, due to changes in foreign exchange rates, domestic goods have taken the opportunity to be exported. In recent months, a large number of cotton textiles and other miscellaneous goods have been shipped to the Philippines on ships such as the Victoria, Queen, Clement, President Quezon, and Asian Queen. However, overseas Chinese organizations such as the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, etc., have never heard of the production of so many domestic goods in Shanghai, and therefore suspect that they are Japanese goods disguised as domestic goods. Newspapers there have also published untrue rumors that a large shipment of Japanese goods was being transferred to the Philippines at the Shanghai Whangpoo Wharf, causing exports of products from well-known domestic goods factories in Shanghai to the Philippines to be detained and their stocks sealed for investigation. Yesterday, the reporter met with a certain gentleman from the Chinese National Goods Exporters Association, who said that he had received telegrams from the Manila Chinese National Goods Chamber of Commerce and the Manila Chinese Overseas Chinese Importers and Exporters Association, instructing them to inform the factories to send representatives to the Philippines to explain and provide small samples of raw materials and products, as well as proof of the operation of each machine, proving that they are definitely not disguised and that there is no Japanese joint venture or control. After the factories learned of the above news, they have requested that the respective trade associations handle the matter separately and complete the certification procedures. According to the dyeing and weaving industry, this setback in the export of domestic goods is due to the lack of external publicity by domestic goods factories in peacetime, which is the main reason for the misunderstandings among overseas Chinese. Therefore, the industry has decided to focus on this in the future, such as the 28th-year supplement to the Creditworthiness Collection of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry, which is currently being compiled.</p>
<h3>Lang Jingshan Photography Exhibition A Grand Occasion</h3>
<p>More than Fifty Frames of A-Pin-Hsiang-commissioned Photography, Group Visit Tickets Half Price</p>
<p>Renowned photographer Lang Jingshan, carrying his precious camera equipment, has traveled all over China. Recently, he displayed 142 frames of his masterpieces from his travels in Sichuan and his meticulously crafted works over the years on the fourth floor of the New World Department Store for a three-day exhibition. Those from all walks of life who love Lang's work have come to visit in an endless stream, making it a grand occasion. Because the dates are very temporary, it will close tonight. Therefore, major and minor schools and groups in the city, such as Soochow University, sent representatives to contact Lang yesterday, hoping to be allowed to visit as a group. Lang has always been open to art and has spared no effort in supporting younger generations. He should not make the young students buy tickets again. Since the purpose of this exhibition is to use all ticket revenue to assist refugees in the mainland, tickets for schools and public groups to visit are calculated at half price. Yesterday, Mr. Xu Tongpei, general manager of A-Pin-Hsiang Inn on Tibet Road, considering that many Westerners visit and stay at the inn, specially went to pre-order more than 50 frames of Lang's famous works to be hung in each room to promote Chinese culture and art. Famous paintings and exquisite rooms complement each other. It is said that more than 100 frames of famous works were pre-ordered by various sectors yesterday. A finely printed "Special Edition" is also sold inside the venue for three yuan per copy, which is of great value for those who love Lang's art to collect.</p>

<h3>Three Siblings Incited by Cousin Steal Grandfather's Bankbook, Withdraw 3,500 Yuan from Bank, Forge a Threatening Letter to Conceal Crime, Driver's Delivery Leads to Exposure and Arrest</h3>
<p>Zhao Wenxuan (71 years old, from Hangzhou), a wealthy silk merchant residing at No. 62, Lane 815, Seymour Road, has one son suffering from paralysis who is bedridden day and night, unable to manage affairs. Grandson Fengzhang (18 years old), second grandson Jinkun (17 years old), and granddaughter Xunmei (20 years old) are all students at schools such as Shanghai Guang. Zhao Wenxuan is over seventy years old and still has concubines. Recently, due to</p>
<p>family disputes</p>
<p>which are quite complex, brothers Zhao Fengzhang and Zhao Jinkun, incited by their cousin Shao Jiajun from Huzhou, planned to open a movie theater, requiring thousands of dollars in capital to achieve their goal. Unable to raise the funds, they discussed it with their sister Zhao Xunmei. Later, Jinkun came up with a method: he saw that his grandfather Zhao Wenxuan had a leather bag containing bankbooks and other valuables, which was often unlocked. He also</p>
<p>conspired with Shao Jiajun</p>
<p>about the theft. At 1:30 PM on the 8th of this month, Zhao Wenxuan loved to visit Bamboo Grove. At that time, he and his concubine were playing mahjong downstairs to pass the time, so the three siblings Zhao Fengzhang took advantage of the opportunity to sneak into their grandfather's bedroom and take two bankbooks, 180 yuan in cash, and five seals from the leather bag. They went to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Beijing Road to withdraw 2,500 yuan in deposits and went to the China</p>
<p>Bank on Tongfu Road</p>
<p>to withdraw 1,000 yuan. The money was transferred to the Pudong Bank on Avenue Edward VII for temporary storage. Afterwards, Zhao Fengzhang, Shao Jiajun, and Shao You (a local, 20 years old, a student at a certain school) jointly discussed that they needed to find a way to conceal the matter. Shao You proposed writing a threatening letter in the name of the Caojiadu People's Self-Government Corps, demanding 3,500 yuan for military expenses, otherwise they would take drastic measures. They wrapped the stolen bankbooks and seals, along with the letter</p>
<p>in paper</p>
<p>and at around 6:00 PM, Shao You went to the Guanglu Automobile Company on Route Paul Beau, French Concession, to hire a car, falsely claiming that he was going to the Paramount Theater near the Racecourse to watch a play. The driver Chen Bugao drove to the vicinity of the theater, where he got off, gave him 5 yuan, and asked him to deliver the paper package to No. 62, Seymour Road, falsely claiming that it was his home. They said that the 3,500 yuan withdrawn from the bank would be handed over to the People's Self-Government Corps, and their grandfather would not pursue the matter if he received the threatening letter. However, Zhao Wenxuan was greatly shocked upon opening it and immediately</p>
<p>detained the driver</p>
<p>and reported it, along with the threatening letter, to the Gordon Road police station. Chinese Detective Wang Chengying and Detective Xie Zhiguang rushed to Zhao's house to investigate. The driver's statement that he knew nothing about the threatening letter, bankbook, and seals in the package revealed that the case was committed by his own family. He immediately took the three siblings Zhao Fengzhang, Jinkun, and Xunmei to the police station and questioned them about the entire incident. Shao Jiajun and Shao You were subsequently apprehended and separately detained. Yesterday, they were transferred to the First Special District Court, where the police lawyer Li Zhishan requested detention, which was approved by Judge Jiang, and the hearing was postponed.</p>
<h3>Bizarre Car Theft Case, Blood Stains in the Car, Police Investigating</h3>
<p>At 6:30 PM the night before last, the Japanese-owned Xinxing Automobile Company at No. 170, Wusong Road, Hongkou, suddenly received a phone call from a customer hiring a car to go to the Bund on Beijing Road. The company sent car No. 17986, but it never returned. The company reported it to the police station, but at 8:50 AM yesterday, the car was suddenly discovered by a patrol near Longmen Road in the Racecourse. There was no one inside, and the driver was nowhere to be found. A bullet was found in the car, and there were blood stains on the driver's seat. The police station is now investigating the case.</p>
<h3>Thugs Snatch Gun Near Yangtze Hotel, Flee After Firing Warning Shot</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that a gang fight broke out at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Hankou Road at around 6:00 PM the night before last. A patrolman was unable to stop it and shot and wounded a pedestrian, Chen Axi. It has now been learned that it was not a gang fight. A Chinese patrolman was on duty near the entrance of the Yangtze Hotel when several thugs tried to snatch his self-defense gun. The patrolman, seeing that he was outnumbered, fired a warning shot, and the thugs fled.</p>
<h3>Coal Stove Poisoning, One Dead, One in Critical Condition</h3>
<p>Winter has arrived, and the cold is biting. Every year at this time, the number of residents poisoned by burning coal stoves for heating is countless. This year, it has not yet been discovered, but yesterday alone, two people were poisoned by coal, one being a woman named Hong, who died of severe coal poisoning at No. 9, Boundary 1285, Avenue Haig at 7:15 AM yesterday, and the other being Li Buyun of No. 57, Siming Villa, Yuyuan Road, who is still in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Burglary, More Than Ten Families Robbed in One Night</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 PM the night before last, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived in Liujia Lane, west of Caohejing Town, Shanghai West, and robbed several families, including farmers Liu Qiusheng, Liu Gensheng, and Shen Ajian. After stealing the loot, they went to the homes of carpenter Wu Yougen and Shen Yinlian in Wu Jiabang, north of the town, and robbed them of clothes and more than a hundred silver dollars. The thieves were still not satisfied and went to Qian Yonglian, Qian Adong, and their neighbors Qian Quansheng and Qian Xingsheng, who worked as chefs in Qianjiatang, No. 4 Bridge, Qinghu Road. By this time, the villagers had sounded the gong to gather a crowd, and the noise was deafening. The thieves did not dare to stay long and fled with their loot. That night, they robbed more than ten families in three villages, and the losses are unknown.</p>
<h3>Chen Linshi's Death Case, Chaozhou Hospital Publishes Account</h3>
<p>Regarding the news of Chen Linshi's death and exhumation for autopsy, it was reported in the newspaper the day before yesterday, but the factual record and content are slightly different. Zhang Kanglong, a director of the Chaozhou Heji Hospital, spoke about the factual account as follows:</p>
<p>On the 20th of last month, Chen Linshi came to the Chaozhou Heji Hospital for treatment, accompanied by her brother Lin Zaokun. When she arrived at the hospital, she was already dead. Dr. Shen Dingyang of the hospital observed that she was already dead and could not be treated. According to regulations, she could not be admitted and was not given any medication or injections. Lin Zaokun carried the body back himself. The hospital's responsibility is to save lives. Her breathing had stopped and she could not be treated, so there was no need for a detailed examination. The cause of her death was unknown, and there were no special signs to indicate suspicion or poisoning, so there was no need for a thorough investigation. If the hospital had known it was poisoning, it would have reported it. On the 6th of this month, the police summoned the hospital staff member Hu Xianrong and learned about Chen Linshi's poisoning. The hospital, fearing being wronged, found the deceased's relative Lin Zaokun, who had accompanied her, the next day to report the case and be questioned to clarify the truth. The previous report that the hospital injected a heart stimulant and accepted bribes to deliberately conceal the matter was completely untrue and had been corrected by various newspapers. Zhang Kanglong stated that the hospital is a charitable hospital established by Chaozhou compatriots to provide relief to the poor and sick. The hospital's employment and management are very strict. Hu Xianrong's character is noble and his service is loyal. There is no possibility of bribery or corruption. Now that the case has been clarified, he has been thoroughly investigating the matter since Hu was detained and feels that the hospital has no responsibility in this case. He also said that the hospital's primary goal is charity and hopes that people from all walks of life will provide enthusiastic maintenance and strict guidance.</p>
<h3>Liyuanfang Rent Increase Case, Landlord Sues Tenants, Requests Court Order to Increase Rent by 40% Per Household, Tenants Resist Unanimously, Verdict Scheduled</h3>
<p>Bao De (transliteration), the legal representative of the China Business Company, recently entrusted lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, and Yang Sicheng to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court's Civil Division against 33 tenants in the Liyuanfang area of Blue Vein Road and Kangti Road, including Fang Guiqing, Qiu Gu Mao, Yu Zhibu, Fang Guoliang, Chen Jiliang, Wang Jinqi, and Wo Yongtang, requesting a court order to increase the rent by 40% per household from July 1st of this year. The court accepted the lawsuit and held a hearing yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Li Liang. The plaintiff was represented by a lawyer, who stated the reasons for requesting the rent increase. The defendant tenants were represented by lawyer Yu Xiufang, accompanied by proxy lawyers Shan Yuhua, Chao Kun, and Zhao Yuxiang, who opposed the rent increase and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The grounds for the defense were that the rent increase for real estate must have a legal basis and cannot be based on the current rise and fall in value, and they cited Article 442 of the Civil Code and Shanghai character No. 70 precedent of the 26th year to oppose it. They also argued that due to the extraordinary times, traffic in the area was blocked, storefronts were closed, and there was no business. In addition to the current rent, the tenants are responsible for the water bill. If the rent is increased again, it will exceed the original amount by more than 60%, which the defendants cannot bear. They requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court verified the situation, allowed both parties' lawyers to debate, announced the conclusion, and scheduled the verdict for the 18th.</p>
<h3>Huangpu River Ferry Collision Case, More Bodies Found</h3>
<p>At around 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, the large wooden civilian ferry of local resident Zhu Jinbiao at the Lingjia Muqiao ferry crossing, west of Yangjing, Pudong, carrying more than 100 passengers, was sailing to the Qiqihar Road pier on the opposite bank when it was hit head-on by a pointed-head Japanese motorboat that came out of the "Fish Market" pier on Qiwupu Road, drowning more than 60 male and female ferry passengers. It has now been learned that the damaged ship was filled with water and was towed to the bank of the Lingjia Muqiao in Pudong yesterday morning, where it was stranded. The bow of the ship was broken open and split in two. From dawn to dusk yesterday, a large number of relatives of the deceased were salvaging the bodies. Another six or seven male and female bodies were salvaged on the beach in Pudong and identified by their relatives. As of last night, 40 bodies had been recovered. It is believed that more than 20 bodies have drifted elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Fourteen-Year-Old Boy Injured by Car, Life in Danger</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, a boy of about fourteen years old was playing with other children in front of the Lafayette Theater on Route Lafayette in the French Concession. The boy suddenly ran into the middle of the road, when a Route 24 trolley bus came speeding along. The boy was unable to avoid it and was knocked down and run over. He was rescued from under the bus by Chinese police officers, but he had already suffered serious injuries and was unconscious. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment, but his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Zhonghe Village Landlord Stops Water Supply, Court Rules Against It, All Tenants Petition Landlord to Restore Water Supply, Willing to Pay Existing Fee, Oppose Rent Increase</h3>
<p>The houses in Zhonghe Village on Rue Bourgeois in the French Concession are managed by lawyer Zhu Yisheng. Water for the tenants has always been supplied by the landlord, with each household paying a monthly water fee of two yuan. However, in May of last year, the landlord announced to the tenants that the water fee would be increased by three yuan per building, totaling five yuan. The tenants agreed at the time. Unexpectedly, the landlord became more demanding. On August 23rd of this year, he announced to the tenants that starting from October of this year, the rent would be increased by five yuan per building.</p>
<p>Each tenant would also be required to install their own water meter, and the water bill would be entirely the responsibility of the tenants. At that time, the water supply would be stopped. Therefore, the tenants of the village believed that the landlord's demand for both rent increases and cutting off the water supply was unreasonable, both legally and morally. Moreover, the water supply was a pre-existing contract and could not be unilaterally cancelled. According to procedures, it should be resolved through litigation. Now the landlord is attempting to change the status quo without pursuing this route,</p>
<p>stopping the water supply to the residents,</p>
<p>which would seriously endanger the safety of hundreds of people. Therefore, they jointly commissioned lawyer Tang Hao to file a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the landlord from cutting off the water supply. The case was reviewed by Judge Chen Can, who ruled that the landlord could not stop the water supply to the petitioners before the litigation was resolved. After receiving the ruling, Feng Ningsheng and others jointly commissioned lawyer Tang Hao to file a petition with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering the landlord to</p>
<p>withdraw the agreement to increase rent,</p>
<p>restore the water supply as before, and have each tenant pay five yuan per building for the water bill, as before. Yesterday, the court accepted the petition, and Judge Chen Ziguan convened a fourth session to summon the defendant, Zhu Yisheng, the manager of Zhonghe Village, who complied. The plaintiff's lawyer, Tang Hao, detailed the facts and reasons why the landlord should not take advantage of this extraordinary period to seek profits. After hearing the arguments, the court instructed that the case be adjourned to November 24th for further hearing, and advised both parties to resolve the matter peacefully in the meantime. Both parties complied and withdrew.</p>
<h3>Repeated Robberies in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Around 7:25 PM last night, in the Columbia Road area of western Shanghai, a foreigner was returning home when he was stopped by two robbers. One of the robbers pulled out a gun, threatened him, and forbade him to move. As a result, he was robbed of 120 yuan in cash before the robbers fled. Afterwards, the foreigner reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation.</p>
<p>In the area near the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads, robberies have been occurring repeatedly in recent times, causing unrest among the residents. Yesterday afternoon around 7:40 PM, robbers broke into No. 14, Lane 32, Jessfield Road, and the total loss of property amounted to over 3,000 yuan. At the time, all the people in the house were held captive by five armed robbers, so they could only let them do as they pleased. After half an hour, the robbers finally left. The homeowner quickly checked the losses and reported them in detail to the police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Summary of Robberies</h3>
<p>At 8:45 AM yesterday morning, a certain person was riding in a hired car when two thugs suddenly rushed out from the side of the Museum Road. One of them pulled out a handgun, stopped the driver from moving forward, and threatened the passenger. As a result, they were robbed of 8,000 Japanese yen before the robbers fled.</p>
<p>On Yu Yuan Road in western Shanghai, around 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, two women were passing by when two thugs suddenly emerged from the roadside.

<h3>Model Airplane Competition Can Encourage People from All Walks of Life to Study Aviation Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>In this era of rapid advancements in scientific products, and with the shadow of war looming over the globe, the acquisition and dissemination of aviation knowledge is undeniably of considerable importance. This is especially true for us, enduring brutal bombings today, where it cannot be ignored. While we may not currently have access to actual aircraft structures for observation and practice, learning the principles and effects from model representations is not impossible. At the very least, it holds more meaning and value compared to making other kinds of recreational models.</p>
<p>This model airplane competition allows free participation for both Chinese and foreigners. The style can be either a flying model or a static model. However, the materials used must include some steel to qualify (because the organizer is a steel factory). While this inevitably contains a business element of promoting their products, we are happy to participate because the participating aircraft models, drawings, designs, and production must be created by the participants themselves.</p>
<p>Creating models naturally requires considerable time. Although the competition is scheduled to be held on January 9, 1940, at the Great World Department Store, promotion has already begun. With more than a month of preparation time, research and creation can be undertaken at leisure. The appearance of bombers, destroyers, fighters, reconnaissance aircraft, and transport aircraft may not be fixed, but their external angles and internal structural equipment must closely resemble the real thing. The more effort invested in research, the more experience gained, and the richer the aviation knowledge becomes. Therefore, the judging criteria are based on structural accuracy, design perfection, cleanliness, and aesthetics to grade the results (the amount of steel used does not affect the judgment).</p>
<p>If we prepare to participate and create such models, it will not only be of interest to ourselves but also have an educational effect on our children. If there are children in your home, you may as well work on it in front of them, indirectly stimulating their innocent little minds and sparking their interest in aviation. Perhaps through this indirect observation, they will develop a lofty ambition to become members of the air force in the future, defending the motherland's airspace; or become aviators to cross the ocean, or even become aircraft workers. The benefits of such an outcome are inestimable.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Learning Fieldwork, a New Realm for Reporters; Practicing Internal Affairs, a Small Scene in the Dormitory</p>
<p>At that time, there were already six of them who had joined together to go to Shanghai for Yu Dan Yun’s wedding. Zhu Airen, the two Miss He's, the Wu Junsu sisters, and also added a new friend, Shao Huihua. Shao Huihua originally had a motorcycle, and could reach Shanghai in less than an hour, but she was now squeezed in with them. Originally, she liked being with friends, and after arriving in Suzhou, she traveled with the Wu Junsu sisters. It was more comfortable to chat and talk on the train along the way. There was no urgent matter, so why ride a motorcycle? But this motorcycle had to be carried along, and perhaps after arriving in Shanghai, an order from the newspaper office would require her to depart. After arriving at the train station, would it not arrive in Shanghai by simply sending it to the baggage car? She had not yet eaten at Wu Junsu's place, so she ate a casual meal in their dormitory cafeteria. Because Shao Huihua treated traveling as a common occurrence, she could eat and sleep anywhere. She had two slogans, called: "Sleep wherever you roll, eat wherever you fly." She had become a healthy body, unlike the delicate young ladies of the past, who needed to be supported with the slightest movement. Nor was she like the frail and delicate bodies of Lin Daiyu depicted in old Chinese novels. She was not the kind of female knight-errant who could decapitate people with a flying sword in Chinese chivalry novels, but she also had the power to defend herself, and often carried sophisticated weapons when going out. Now, Wu Junsu told her that three more friends were coming at three o'clock in the afternoon to go to Shanghai together, and she was especially happy. She knew of Zhu Airen, but she had never met the two Miss He's. Moreover, since they were twins, and it was said that their faces were identical, she wanted to see them even more, especially since she had always loved being with friends. Seeing the two Miss He's now, she would naturally fall in love with them. People who love being with friends naturally have more friends, the more the better. At this time, Zhu Airen asked Wu Junsu, "When are we going? Won't we have to buy tickets when we get to the station? Wouldn't it be better to go a little earlier?" Wu Junsu smiled, opened her desk drawer, took out six train tickets, and showed them to her, saying, "The train tickets have already been bought, what other tickets do you need?" Zhu Ai said, "Huh! Have you already sent someone to the train station to buy them?" Wu Junsu said, "Why go to the train station? There's a travel agency here." Originally, this Soochow University had more than 3,000 faculty, staff, and students. Adding the affiliated middle school and the nearby universities, there were more than 5,000 people in total. Their school had a trust service society, and the service society had a small travel agency attached to it. (202)</p>

<h3>Knitting Masters and Woolen Yarn Workers, Intense Business Competition, Woolen Yarn Shops Hire Knitting Masters, Woolen Yarn Ladies All Contract System, Poor Treatment</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>It's getting cold, and woolen yarn is on the market again. Although affected by the European War, this year's woolen yarn, imported goods cost more than nine yuan per pound, and domestic woolen yarn also costs seven or eight yuan per pound. But because of the fact that large and small department stores are filling their entire windows with woolen yarn, and young women are coming and going like shuttles, walking into department stores to buy woolen yarn, the fact tells you that the price of woolen yarn is allowed to be expensive, there are still many people wearing clothes knitted from woolen yarn.</p>
<p>In recent years, in the city of Shanghai, regardless of the size of the store, merchants in general have been competing fiercely in business, and have come up with various methods to attract customers. Advertising and window dressing have made considerable progress. In such an environment, shops selling woolen yarn are certainly no exception. Neon advertising, banners for large discounts, and the addition of special-priced goods departments are common. Moreover, many shops selling woolen yarn have hired knitting masters from this year on, to provide free guidance on knitting methods to customers who buy woolen yarn, the purpose of course is also to attract customers.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Xing Sheng Street in the French Concession is the general gathering place for the woolen yarn market. There, in general woolen yarn shops, in addition to the layout and decoration being even more advanced than in previous years, almost every store has a knitting master hired, sitting in the store hall, taking needles and woolen yarn, and guiding the ingenious knitting methods. The four sides are surrounded by young women, some watching, some learning. In addition to Xing Sheng Street, in other roads, department stores with larger scale, on the counters selling woolen yarn, also mostly have knitting masters hired, to guide customers face-to-face. It is said that most of these knitting masters are graduates of the knitting school founded by Ms. Feng Qiuping. This extremely position is temporary, and they will be laid off when the woolen yarn is out of season. In terms of treatment, it is roughly between twenty or thirty yuan to forty or fifty yuan per month, depending on the scale of the woolen yarn shop and the skills of the knitting master. Regarding food and lodging, it is probably food provided but no lodging. As a knitting master, if you count on half a year of work, then you can also earn two or three hundred yuan!</p>
<p>But in Shanghai, there are many young women who only know how to enjoy themselves and do not do needlework. If they want to wear clothes, no matter what it is, they go to buy ready-made ones. As a result, general department stores, in addition to woolen yarn, also sell knitted woolen yarn clothing. Woolen yarn shirts and woolen yarn socks, although mostly machine-made, there are also many hand-knitted ones. Therefore, once winter arrives, there will be many female workers who rely on knitting woolen yarn for a living.</p>
<p>Some of the female workers who knit woolen yarn are directly hired by department stores, and some are hired by woolen yarn factories. Knitted into large quantities of woolen yarn clothing, and then wholesale to department stores. In terms of treatment, both types of female workers are paid on a contract basis. If you knit a woolen yarn garment, you will be paid the price of one piece. Although woolen yarn is more than twice as expensive as last year, the wages of female workers who knit woolen yarn are still about the same as last year. Knitting a vest, only one yuan or so in wages, a woolen yarn shirt, only two yuan. And no matter how fast your hands and feet are, it takes two or three days to knit a woolen yarn shirt, so on average you can't earn thirty yuan a month. In terms of the current living standards of "isolated island", then knitting woolen yarn for others, removing personal food expenses, what is left is limited. The same is knitting woolen yarn, but it is much worse than a knitting master.</p>

<p>Entertainment</p>
<h3>Entertainment and Life</h3>
<p>— Yanran</p>
<p>Entertainment – Good and meaningful entertainment has a huge impact on audiences. It can encourage the public's interest in life, guide us in our way of dealing with the world, our attitude towards life... These are not even the great aspects; at this moment of approaching victory in the war of resistance, it can even, imperceptibly, strengthen the public's determination to win the war of resistance and build the nation. From this point of view, today's entertainment industry not only shoulders the mission of guiding the public to strive for progress, but also contains a great responsibility that cannot be ignored, especially from the standpoint of national resistance.</p>
<p>However, the relationship between entertainment and life, as well as the impact on the future of the war of resistance, is certainly like this. But in the entertainment industry of the isolated island today, there are very few who can truly shoulder this sacred mission. On the other hand, there are many who hang up the signboard of entertainment and engage in activities that harm the young public every day, which is something that makes us feel very painful.</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that the entertainment industry of the isolated island should examine itself, and that colleagues should honestly and frankly supervise each other. If it is discovered that a certain entertainment venue is doing that! When engaging in activities that harm the public, such as "hanging a sheep's head and selling dog meat," they must be severely punished in order to maintain the discipline of the entertainment industry. Because only in this way can we reduce the chances of the young public falling into depravity, and indirectly increase the power of resisting Japan and building the nation.</p>
<p>In short, entertainment has a close relationship with the impact on life and the future of the war of resistance. How can we accomplish this great mission? This depends on the efforts of the people in the entertainment industry and the effect of the personal practice of the general employees.</p>
<h3>On "Fen River Bay" in Xindu</h3>
<p>— Traveling Reporter</p>
<p>"Fen River Bay" emphasizes dialogue and acting. According to Peking Opera, dialogue is generally divided into five categories: introduction, poetry, exposition, explanation, and song; acting is divided into three sections: expression, movement, and martial arts. This play specifically emphasizes "explanation" and "expression." The dialogue between the male and female leads in this play must be fluent and natural in tone, and must also be expressed, and must be maintained subtly. If the actors in the play are slightly less capable, then the highlight of the entire play will be lost completely.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to the Xindu Theater to watch the performance of "Fen River Bay" by artists Yu Sulian and Yang Ruiting. When I arrived, it happened to be when Sulian took the stage. Sulian, who plays Liu Yingchun, deeply portrays the identity and personality of the character in the play, and Yang Ruiting, who plays Xue Rengui, is naturally extremely experienced. The dialogue between the two is very pleasant to listen to. The sentences in the dialogue have been slightly increased or decreased from the original script. When the husband and wife have a small argument in the cold cell, they both specifically add dialogue, which is quite humorous. The only two sentences deleted from the original script are when Rengui takes out the gold seal, Yingchun first treats it as useless copper, and then Rengui explains that it is a gold seal. Here, Rengui was originally going to say, "Now you are a first-rank madam." Liu Yingchun also said, "Haha, a first-rank madam." At the same time, there should be a happy expression. These two sentences "first-rank madam" are quite important and should not be deleted.</p>
<p>Overall, the combination of Yu and Yang is indeed appropriate, and the dialogue is concise and experienced. Dialogue is most taboo for being long-winded, and it emphasizes the rhyme of the words. I dare not speak randomly about the division of yin and yang and the distinction between sharp and round sounds, but listening to Sulian's dialogue, the pronunciation is accurate, and the tone is also light, heavy, fast, and slow, just right; at the same time, she can express joy, anger, sorrow, joy, fear, love, and disgust on her face as naturally as possible, which is indeed very moving. There are not many singing segments in this play, only two segments of Xipi and Erliu. Sulian's singing is also very pleasant to the ear. As far as I know, Sulian can perform many plays, and is good at both Hua Dan plays and body movement plays, and is also proficient in martial arts. As for Yang Ruiting, he is a famous Peking Opera star who has enjoyed fame for a long time. His collaboration with Sulian can be described as equally matched in skill. With excellent artists and a good play, it is naturally extraordinary!</p>
<h3>Liu Jiqun Passed Away Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>— Yindi</p>
<p>Stroke During Broadcast Last Night, Remains Scheduled for Grand Funeral Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Death of a Comedian Star</p>
<p>Liu Jiqun, one of the clowns on the Chinese film scene, the big fat man who has always been partnered with a skinny monkey" Han Langen, suddenly passed away yesterday morning! This is the fall of another superstar after Shang Guanwu.</p>
<p>It was the night before yesterday (the 13th) that Liu Jiqun was invited by someone to broadcast on the Damei Radio Station, when he unfortunately suffered a sudden stroke. People in the studio were terrified at the time and quickly took him to Tongren Hospital, but the hospital authorities refused to admit him because Liu Jiqun's mind was already unconscious, so they had no choice but to change to No. 3, Shenchengli, West Aimes Road, his home. As a result, although he was given medical treatment, he eventually died of a burst blood vessel, unable to be saved, and passed away at Yinshi, that is, yesterday morning, finally closing his eyes and leaving this world.</p>
<p>Liu Jiqun was a native of Wujin, Jiangsu, and enjoyed a life of 40 years. He left behind a son and a daughter, a son of seventeen and a daughter of fourteen, both of whom are still in school. After Jiqun's death, Mrs. Liu wailed and was extremely sad. The remains have been moved to the World Funeral Home and are scheduled for a grand funeral on the 16th.</p>
<p>Liu has been engaged in the life of mercury lamps for more than ten years. His first work was the Pacific Film Company's "The Daughter Who Picks Stars," in which he co-starred with Wang Hanlun. A few years ago, he started working with Han Langen at Lianhua Film Company, and only then did he earn the nickname of Eastern Laurel and Hardy. Now, he is one of the basic actors of Xinhua Film Company; on the screen, he not only performs as a clown, but he is also quite good at roles such as old people.</p>
<p>His last posthumous work is the comedy "The Second Landlord and the Third Tenant" directed by Tang Jie. Liu Jiqun plays the role of Xiao Chen in this film. Fortunately, the entire film was completed before Liu's death, and it will soon be shown at the New Light Grand Theater. From then on, this "Eastern Hardy" can only be seen on the screen!</p>
<h3>A Scoop of Silver Sea</h3>
<p>— Diyin</p>
<p>"A Desolate Pagoda Holds a Grievance", co-starring Chen Yanyan, Tong Yuejuan, Sun Min, and Wang Xianzai, directed by Yang Xiaozhong, is now decided to be renamed "Legend of the White Snake", the film has been shot seven or eight tenths.</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang's new work "Yue Fei" has recently started filming, with Liu Qiong as Yue Wumu, Xia Xia as Yue's mother, Huang Naishuang as Li, Zhang Zhizhi as Niu Gao, and Hong Jingling as Zhang Bangchang.</p>
<p>Diao Banhua has lost some weight after giving birth, and will now star in "Burning the Biyun Palace", directed by Wen Yimin.</p>
<p>Xinhua invited Shi Xin and Wu Suqiu to film "Pan Si Dong", which is still under negotiation, and there is hope of an agreement.</p>
<p>The script for "Confucius" has now been completed by Fei Mu and is scheduled to start filming on the 17th of this month at the Lianhua General Factory. Costumes and props are being rushed to be made. However, the choice of actors for the role of Confucius has not yet been decided. It is said that Xiao Ying will be hired to take the role, and the outcome will be known in a few days.</p>
<p>Xinhua's new star Chen Chong, formerly named Chen Gengsheng, changed his name to Chen Chong after "Li Sanniang". He and the stage artist Zheng Zhong are just like a pair of Laurel and Hardy with different surnames and the same name.</p>
<h3>Dahua to Open, Premiering "Golden Jade Hall"</h3>
<p>All the engineering work of the Dahua Grand Theater has reached the top of the spire. Students of the Civil Engineering Department of Fudan University often make prior pilgrimages to the city's great buildings as practical evidence of their theories. They specially wrote a letter to the Dahua authorities, seeking their consent. Li Diyun, the general manager of the hospital at the time, replied, granting permission. On the afternoon of the 10th, all the students attended to visit the entire hospital and expressed their heartfelt admiration for the transformation work of the architect Chen Zhi. It is said that the theater's opening blockbuster has been decided to be "Golden Jade Hall", a full-length comedy with singing, in which Mickey Rooney's performance overwhelms Eddie Cantor, a demonstration work of 1939. The opening date has not yet been officially decided.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Opera World: A Drama Praising a National Hero</h3>
<p>— Xu Mu</p>
<p>Having said that, he immediately got up and entered the inner hall. At this time, only the wife and young son were by his side. The loving couple found it difficult to part, and he couldn't bear to be separated from his son forever. However, the rebel soldiers were approaching, and the sounds of killing shook the land. Therefore, Yu Ji had no choice but to use resolute means to force his wife to answer, saying, "I am dying for the country. I wonder if you can keep your chastity for me?" At that time, it was a feudal era, and his wife was middle-aged and beautiful, so it was no wonder Zhou had this question. However, the wife also deeply understood the great righteousness. To strengthen Zhou's confidence, she drew her dagger and, in front of her husband, pretended to cut her throat. When the son saw his loving mother being forced to die tragically, he also banged his head against the wall and died. Yu Ji was grieving for his wife and lamenting for his son when suddenly, the backyard was ablaze with fire. It turned out that after the old madam went inside to change clothes, she urgently ordered the family general to move firewood and straw, surrounding the back hall, and firmly instructed him to set fire to the room, then sat upright in the room, quietly waiting for death. The old family general, having received three generations of deep grace from his master, could not bear to witness the tragic death of the mistress, and also threw himself into the raging flames to die for his master. By the time Yu Ji arrived, it was too late to save them. He thought that his old mother and wife had all died tragically, so there was nothing to worry about. Therefore, he kowtowed and prayed towards the fire, then turned to the front hall, gathered the family general and the daredevils in the city, and charged out of the city together. At this time, everyone was determined to die, and everyone had the ambition to repay the country. They fought one against a hundred, killing countless rebel soldiers. However, due to the disparity in numbers, the rebel soldiers' arrows and stones fell like rain, all hitting Zhou's body. Therefore, he finally exhausted his strength and died under a rain of arrows. In total, the four virtues of loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness were all possessed by the Zhou family. Therefore, the play is also named "Full Family of Loyalty and Martyrs," which is based on the facts. (141)</p>
