<h3 id="c20">英美聯合經濟制日問題 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>近幾天來，英美對淤日本關閉中國門戶的企圖，已有聯合採取強硬態度的傾向，日昨倫敦路透電稱，英美對遠東問題已相互交換意見。內容如何，雖不得而知，但據一般觀察，兩國當已根據同樣事實而有同樣的決定、若干對日報復行動，可以希望採用。現在美國會中正在討論對日制裁問題和足以影響中日戰爭的中立法案，英首相張伯倫也已表示對遠東問題將隨美國的態度而轉移，如美國對日制裁和中立法的修正案能夠成立，則目前所傳的對日經濟報復問題，立即可以成爲事實。在遠東黑暗而混亂的現勢下，英美這種行動將會展開一個新的局面。</p>
<p>照目前形勢看來，中日戰爭已屆緊要關頭，英美等國要保全她們在遠東的權益，維持世界的正義與和平，以現時戰爭的情勢和英美國內的環境，都是對日施行經濟報復最適當的時候：就遠東方面言，中國自轉入第二期抗戰階段後，軍事上的地位日趨有利，政治上因妥協動搖分子的肅淸而愈益明朗，英美若於此時對日實行經濟報復，直接固係反對法西斯主義的侵害權益，間接就是加强中國抗戰的力量，足令中國縮短獲得最後勝利的期限。現在的日本，在對華侵略戰上已是一籌莫展，而國內黃金的大量外流，對外貿易的迅速降落，物價的高漲和失業的增加，又已使整個經濟開始崩潰。現在英美能夠利用這個機會對日實施經濟壓力，自然足以迫令日本停止她的侵略行動。</p>
<p>並且，日本在華的侵略行動，因國內外形勢的日趨不利，對於排斥歐美在華勢力和擴大侵略範圍的工作，瘋在地在加緊進行。前不久日本大言不慚的宣稱所謂「對華樹立新秩序」的在言，最近已有封鎖華北各港口的事實表現。日本在遠東的企圖，决不以掠取中國爲滿足，這已有許多事實可以證明：日本的輿論界，去年底間也已公開表示，日本應奪取香港新加坡以及印度等地，英美現在若不及時設法阻止日本野心的發展，一待侵略者毛羽豐滿之後，英美等國不但在中國以及遠束各國的權益無法保全，就是要想維持她們本身的和平，恐怕也不可能。這或者也是促令她們覺悟必須聯合經濟制日的原因吧！</p>
<p>就英美本身方面情形言，過去英國民衆對於中國的抗戰　，始終是抱着同情的態度，而政府則時常想從現實主義中和侵略者來妥協。可是英政府的妥協政策，結果也終於大失所望。現在英國一般民衆對於經濟制裁日本的要求，固是非常迫切，如旅華英僑，已兩决電請政府以有效的方法，保全她們在華的權益！國內銀行界和出口商，也正在設法使政府改變她的妥協政策；便是英國政府方面，也已覺悟到在遠東政策方面非改變態度不可。他們知道英國對華二萬五千萬鎊的投資現在已不能從妥協中獲得安全的保證。例如英國有投資關係的京滬鐵路，在日軍控制之下早已通車營業，不僅不允許英人有所干預，甚至連英人要求視察也遭拒絕。這便是給英國政府很好的敎訓。所以英首相張伯倫於美羅斯福總統發表抨擊侵略行爲的言論後，也就立即以書面談話表示贊同，並即召集閣員考慮增加日貨關稅和對華經濟特惠待遇等辦法。這就是表示英國政府也已承認祗有採取經濟報復手段才是保全她們在華權盆的最有效的辦法了。</p>
<p>至於美國政府和人民，對於中國的抗戰，向來就有極熱烈的贊助，過去雖曾有少數孤立主義者表示反對，但以日本侵略暴行的不斷演出，他們也已逐漸地改變態度，如美國運往侵略國家的軍火，過去的數額非常鉅大，自經美國務卿赫爾勸阻後，現在却大大地减少了。羅斯福總統這决在國會中所提出的中立法修正案，無疑的乃是對於援華工作將有積極的表示。並且現在已得到一般輿論的贊助，美國和平與民治協會的七十五萬會員，聯合上書政府要求禁運軍火和停供信用貸欵予侵略國家，可見美國政府和人民對於經濟報復日本的問題，也已有漸趨一致的表示。</p>
<p>英美兩國聯合對日經濟報復行動的必要與其趨勢，現時旣已這樣顯著，目前所成爲重大問題的，乃是具體的實行方法問題。我們知道一般金融資本家所注意的私人物質上的利潤，未必常和具有遠大眼光的大政治家的政策響應；而英美等國各殖民地對日經濟關係的密切，允足令經濟報復的舉動，不無實際困難存在，此則惟有盼望英美等國眼光遠大的政治家如羅斯福赫爾艾登愛理彭克輩向英美人民多作幾决呼籲，動員民衆的力量，想總可以易收成效吧！</p>

<p>有許多男子因為不知衛生，或犯上不良的嗜好，致減弱了新陳代謝的機能，故雖年歲尚輕，而精神與肉體均陷於衰頹狀態，所謂腎虧一症，都屬早衰而來，蓋青年正當元陽充沛之時，照理決無此種毛病；但因自　與縱慾的關係，年尚年壯，其生殖力就要逐漸衰退了。無論遇上何種機會，均不能發揮其健全之精力，此即腎虧的現象也。</p>
<p>本來人到中年之後，方有此不幸的現象；此由於生理衰退之故，致青春腺亦隨而衰老。照一般的情形觀察，普通健康的男性，大約在廿歲左右時青春腺異常繁榮，俟至中年之後，勢已成強弩之末，無能為力矣，但若不知　生，則未到中年，此種疾病即已爆發，此誠人生之一大悲劇也。</p>
<p>然則，此時如能將雄壯動物的青春腺（即睪丸部分）精質，以補入人體，即可促進其繁榮，解除早衰，而恢復其固有的精力，以獲得返老還童，此即現代醫學最新發明之臟器療法是也。</p>
<p>譬如一個四十歲的人，感覺精力衰退，從事此種療法之後，上述之弊害至少可再遲至十年始得發生，其治療成績，在臨床上已有確實之證明。</p>
<p>青春腺素製劑男用「補體康」之應用於臟器療法者，業已有攸久之歷史，吾輩做醫師者，已正確認出其藥力，一小時藥力開始，廿四小時即生精袖腎，故富有活潑其神經及補腎，補血，補腦之數大功能，不論患者之疾是屬於早洩或神經衰弱，未老先衰，甚至發育不全，婚後不姙，服「補體康」之後，即得回春效果，在一千例中，失望者幾乎幾無一有</p>
<p>早衰腎虧之後，不僅使夫婦之愛情如此淡薄，如若早年患此，將演出終身絕嗣的悲哀</p>
<p>蓋生殖能力與健康成正比例，故早衰腎虧的人，積極服以青春腺素製劑男用「補體康」之後，不僅能發揮健全的生殖力，且身體已日漸健康矣。</p>

<p>手淫遺精，並不是不治之症，如若症狀輕微，並無何種弊害，而在結婚後即可自動消滅於無形，如若手淫過度，或有滑精及遺精頻繁現象，則應速治。尤宜先戒絕手淫，從事高尚遊戲，清心寡慾，很易轎正手淫惡癖。然後服以「耐而斯遺精片」，每日於睡前用璥水吞服三片，有當晚止遺之功，同時以睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」培補虧損，注意攝生，即可在短期間內恢復固有的健康，此種家庭療法，不僅經濟而簡易，且功效確實，毫無流弊。德國醫學博士鄭</p>

<p>白濁數天包好已被事實擊破</p>
<p>近來對於一般淋藥之治療，已墜入五里霧中，蓋餘因診務關係，時有病人乞餘治療，而大概多向餘陳述被一般服藥三五天包好之市上成藥所誤。服了一二個，依然如石投大海，金錢損失不貲，而所壓之痛苦尤深、真是貪小而失大、而考其實際，仍然是陳腐之劣質，如畢澄茄，檀香油等混質。而美其名為某種新的成分，真有「借屍還魂」的企圖。其實此輩毫無醫學常識之病家，對於淋病，不去想想看那有三五天包好的事，就是以梅毒的「六〇六」而論，也沒有三五天可以斷根之事，我們說淋毒可以治好的特效藥，是有的。但要此等特效藥在三五天之內可以根治，那豈非欺人的鬼話。好在一般數天包好的市上劣藥，已經此等鐵一般事實所打破。無復顧戀餘地。</p>
<p>現在吾人以真確之科學知識，指導病家轉趨光明之途，在萬刧不磨之淋病內服藥中，以德國淋病學大師彼德博士所發明之「克淋儂」一藥，功效最為優勝。因博士以天縱之才、刻苦自勵、經三十餘年之研究，根據非特異療法原理，發明採用蛋白體黃色素混合製劑而成「克淋儂」，其功效曾經著名淋病臨床實騐家希哈勒博士，作精細之分析的研究試騐，知每一淋病患者，服「克淋儂」以後，其細胞因受「克淋儂」藥力之鼓動，而發生一種抗淋殺菌的微妙作用。故不論淋病初起，抑久服其他淋藥所不愈者，服「克淋儂」絕對可以治愈之。但並非一般市上成藥相比。因為「克淋儂」一藥，按病情之輕重深淺，而確定其治愈之時期，並非一概說三五天可根治，因正確的淋病特效藥，不能作毫不合理之宣傳。而必須以「效力」二字示人，方可呌病家信服，因為事實勝於雄辯，我們不能用掛羊頭賣狗肉之欺人之言，以博病家之一試。</p>

<p>如何才可稱為白濁全治</p>
<p>治淋不可掛一漏萬</p>
<p>治一種傳梁病，在有經騐之醫師，決不僅僅顧到病家一己之病情，而對於其親屬，亦當作萬全之準備，例如患淋病者，其已結婚之男子，苟一染到此病，則對方之妻子，決難守身如玉，而能避免淋毒之蹂躪，因淋菌一物，其傳染力甚強，雖偶爾接觸一次，即可傳染，何況同衾共枕之夫婦，其能免於淋病之侵襲乎？故醫家在此時期，對病家必給以道德上之指示，萬一不幸失婦雙方均已染毒，則更宜同時治療，庶無掛一療萬，輾轉傳染，永難有治愈之虞，故其惟一解決方法，必須雙方同時治療，例如男子已將淋病徹底治愈，而不注意其妻子之淋病，則又因性的關係而再染。</p>
<p>夫妻無毒方許同居</p>
<p>據吾人之經騐，處置此等兩性淋病，並非難事。不論男子淋病初起，或患淋病已十年以上之長遠歷史，概可選用德國X線或抗淋血清，及靜電療法，更用淋病　劑「克淋儂」為必須之內服藥，在吾臨床實騐之統計上，服「克淋儂」自三星期至五星期，無不克秦根治之效。女子淋毒除服「克淋儂」外，更可外用「卡而　地陰道片」為坐藥，以滌除　道白帶與淋菌，亦可於三星期中根治之。必須證明雙方確無淋毒後，方可稱為全治而許其同居　診時上午十時至下午六時，自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角</p>
<h3 id="c34">肺病應付方策 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>近因科學發達，醫藥學均呈突飛猛進之勢，而肺病治療法，也有長足之進展，「補肺拿爾」一藥，即受科學之推動力而發明者，此劑證明對於各期肺病，有短期奏效之功。並可使肺部空洞部分逐漸縮小，以至平伏如恒，因此「補肺拿爾」遂推為肺　菌內服藥中之祭酒，確非過譽之言。此外凡老年哮喘，夜不安枕，小兒百日咳，均有良效，其補肺抗癆之力，遠駕各種魚肝油之上，此為中外醫家所公認，故能在肺病藥中執其牛耳。</p>

<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>公偵交易雖已化爲暗盤，但外商經營之所謂「衆業公所」，則始終在公開吸牧國內資金。開戰以來，國內資金外流之中，由此門戶出亡者爲數至鉅，試觀下表可知：</p>
<p>今昨年一至十二月十六日止衆業公所證券成交股數</p>
<p>種數　一九三七年成交數　一九三八年成交數</p>
<p>（註）來源根據North　China　Daily　News</p>
<p>Dec．17．1938．</p>
<p>於該所上塲之各種股票與債券，皆爲外商所發行，本年各種證券之成交數，幾莫不較前激增。被吸收之國資，爲數必甚鉅大。回憶歐戰時各國，祗有向海外獲取資金，收回本國在外之證券投資，而我國獨反是。至可嘆也！</p>
<p>上海於去冬淪陷，故各銀行祗辦結賬，不辦結束。至本年，各行大都已陸續補行結束，並將資產貸借對照表公布。茲將會員銀行中國，浙江興業，通商，中國農工，上海商業，浙江實業，中國墾業，華僑，四川美鹽，聚興盛，東亞，中孚，國華，浦東，中國勸工，至中，通和（已於本年停業）永大，永亨，中和，川康，中國企業，中南等二十三家資產負債重要各項，分別統計，並與前年度比表如次（單位國幣千元）</p>
<p>上海二十三家會員銀行重要營業項目統計表</p>
<p>民二十六年度　民二十五年度實收資本　一一六，四三〇　一〇九，一二八公積金　二八，八八〇　三三，四八二　現金　四八一，六二〇　一三一，一七六兌換券　二二二，二八一　……各項放款一，一六七，九七九　一，四九六，六〇二有價證券　二三四，五五七　一六八，三八八</p>
<p>（註）本表由作者根據各行資產借對照表，分別歸併統計而成，如有錯誤，尙希讀者指正</p>
<p>上表中有一至可驚人數字，即公積金之减低，百思不得其解。至於放款之收縮，存款之略减，現金屯有價證券之增大，充分表露戰時狀態。純益固亦較前激减，但除中國銀行一家二十六年度係純　外，餘皆一致略有盈餘。而最可觀者爲華僑，東亞，中南，四川美豐，中國農工，國華，浙江實業，浙江興業等數行，皆在二十萬元之上。餘則多者十數萬，少者二千多元者不等。會聞某行於八一三後，從未執行安定金融辦法，限制存戶提款，因之吸進仔款至鉅；其後在外滙暗市上之出進亦最力云云。而今固亦在大獲純益之中；殊令人至堪痛恨也！</p>
<p>如扣除純損之中國銀行不計，二十六年年度純益者共二十二家，實收資本共七六，四三〇，〇〇〇元，則其純益率爲穴，四四％，在戎馬倥惚砲彈紛飛下而復如是，可謂着實不錯矣。然反觀英商滙豐銀行之報吿，去年純益額達一二，一二七，五四二港元，而其實收資本僅二〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇港元，相形之下，能不觸目驚心？邇來各國政府之所以鼓吹銀行合併，此豈僅爲各銀行自身之完全已哉？</p>
<p>至於本年各銀行之營業情形如何？目前可得之材料極少，姑以某大銀行一家之資產貸借對照表觀之：</p>

<p>自爲星相家</p>
<p>乃以林木森爲名、俾遂其欺世之技、有住居靜安寺路八十二號之少婦薛氏、因惑於電台廣播之誇大言詞、自上年六月間竟往求卜、該婦與所天、適不甚和洽、被華窺悉隱衷、當由此一弱點、進言煽惑、正抓住該婦之癢處、認爲靈異、於是華以彼有奇術可回復其夫婦愛情相誘、隨以白色細粉少許付之、命携歸潛置於茶內</p>

<p>本市外棉交易、各華廠因本棉價格之高昂、且父無大量數額可購、故對外棉之購意、異常濃厚、一部份華廠已在此苛刻條件之一成定銀下訂購、尙有一部份華廠仍在拒購外棉之相持中、昨日各日廠因舉行會議、故亦無大量交易、茲將昨日成交件額及現貨行市、分列於後、</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>——戰地旅行雜感</p>
<p>一個晴明的初冬的早晨，我獨自從鵝湖書院沿斜塔爬上峰頂山的高峰；朝陽初出，濃霧瀰谷，路旁的白茶花蒙着露潤，顯得格外有生氣。那天，也不知由於這有名的哲學家—朱陸二氏勝會之地，引起我的懷古之念？還是由於這冷悄肅穆的初冬氣氛，激刺我的其想？胸中總覺得有點異樣，默默的想，緩緩的走，想到朱陸當年在此論學，各有異同，他們携手同行，有時無言，有時激辯，有時心契，不知他們也想到千百年後，由同得異，由異歸同，別開許多壯闊波瀾吾？</p>
<p>正當冥想神會之際，空中嗡嗡飛機之聲，打斷了我的思路；其時，我忽轉一念，提出這樣的問題：假使朱熹和陸象山都生在現代，和朱陸都立一部分異的呂祖謙（金華學派大師）也到鵝湖參加討論，三人舌辯風生，各不相下的時候，敵人的機飛來了，他們三人的態度究竟怎樣？這倒是極耐人思索的。陸象山也許正襟危坐，神色不變，朱熹也許想到聖人行權之道以及「君子不立於巖牆之下」的古訓；呂帆謙呢，大概立刻停止參加辯論，覺得挖防空壕比哲理辯論切於實際。飛機過後，誰是誰非，又可以寫破每人的筆尖；但若鵝湖書院中的弟子是現在正在唸書的靑年，他們的判斷立刻可以定下來，因為他們相信敵人的飛機眞會投下炸彈來，把正襟危坐的陸九淵炸成肉餅的，他們會覺得金華學派所走現實的路是正路。</p>
<p>下山時，斜塔的頂尖又觸動我另一種心念：鵝湖書院，這儒家的聖地，和峰頂山宏濟寺，那佛家的聖地，她們之間又怎麽一種交涉？難道山脚的斜塔，就算爾疆我境的分水綫，彼此不會側目互睨嗎？或者陸象山的態度，比較接近峰頂山那一邊，朱熹則屬於鵝湖書院的圈子，呂祖謙則在鵝湖的圈子以外，他們的門弟子對於山寺沙彌的態度，允有根本的不同之處。這樣推導下去，這問題就越來越複雜；那天早晨，我的心頭，就成熟了一種人生哲學—亂世的人生哲學。</p>
<p>在峰頂山與鵝湖之間，其基本上有絕不相同的生命觀；佛家主張靜的美，以「湼般」為生命的歸宿，儒家中張動的美，以「自强不息」為「變易的大道，陸偏於佛，故主明心見性」，朱偏於儒，故主「窮理處事一，呂祖謙葉水心陳同甫以及淸初顏李學派，更近於儒，故主「閱歷世事，窮究經濟一。（經濟指民生經濟而言。）靜的美，容易體會；人到中年，更懂得閒靜安適的味兒。動的美，却非有正面對着現實的勇氣不能領略；跟着動而來的，擺在眼前便是亂得一團糟　現實，過慣着安閑生活的人，只知道一團糟只是和他的生活秩序開玩笑，什麽舊的法程，都不能讓他好好兒應付，動亂就使他頭痛，不斷的頭痛。等到他懂得動亂之下，活躍着生命之流，那生命之流父飛躍着向前面去，又使他覺得頭痛了，此所以朱熹局居於鵝湖的圈之中，而儒家也只苟全於中庸之道。處在亂世，「中庸」是不够的，得有一副更積極的人生態度。</p>
<p>西諺云：「少年人多熱而少光，中年人多光而少熱」。動亂的世界，乃是火的世界，非多熱的人不能迎頭趕上去。</p>

<h3 id="c156">疏散 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>號角在古城頭上奏出了雄亮的音調，搶刺在初昇的朝陽中閃閃地生光；雖然是寒冬的氣候，晨風裏還帶著些溫柔，吹拂著那一羣昨夜開來的戰士</p>
<p>我望到戰士們敏捷地跑步，忙碌地分佈到各條市街和郊野，那一種激昂而勇毅的情緒，使我意會到，劇烈的消耗戰叉將在這裹展開了。</p>
<p>果然，時間已不再允許非戰士對這古城留戀，和靄的憲警，也來催促安伏在家圜裏的人們，向四野裏疏散；緊張而嚴肅的空氣，冲淡了一羣人的自私觀念，增加了一羣人對流亡的認識，於是，我們把這個古老的城坦，當作了一個旅途送別的友人，平凡地離開了。</p>
<p>再會罷，古老的城坦！將來我們邁　歸來，美麗的山河已恢復了完整，强大的民族已獲得了目由，那被毀的焦土上，我們一定可以重新建立起史美麗的家園！現在，我們在充滿了期望的興奮中，只好扶持着龍鍾的老者，牽引着孩童，跟隨着前導的憲警，嚴肅而整齊地，走過狹窄的市街，穿過半圯的城門洞，擠過縱橫交錯的鐵絲網，向那蓬勃繁榮的後方投奔！</p>
<p>像流雲似的人羣，蠕動在那空無所有的田路上，不知道分散成了若干批！有的爬上了高山，有的繞過了森林，有的渡過了灘河，有的已超越了人眼的視線，隱沒了；祗有開來佈防的部隊，像列車似的疾駛而來，人影由微小而放大，而和疏散的人羣背道而行，撲向那古城週遭的陣地上去；那麽緊密而連接的英勇戰士，就像初春的田裹新出來的麥苗，透露着蓬勃向榮的雄姿，再加上溫柔太陽光的照射，愈顯出他們的偉大與清高！</p>
<p>這一切，因而加增了非戰士的期望，堅定了被疏散者的勝利信念，在緊張的情緒中，誰都把一個引敵深人的使命，寄託在那埋伏的勇士隊羣，誰都熱望那空虛的死城，變成窺伺者的墓塚。</p>
<p>走呵，走罷！我跟隨着最後疏散開來的一批壯丁，穿過了鐵絲網時，偶爾回首凝望，哦！古老的城頭，祇有孤寂與空虛，異樣的嚴峻，異樣的冷漠，使我作起劇烈的寒慄，使我加速着步伐，趕奔前程。</p>
<p>在堅壁淸野了的田路上，每前進一程，人數也减了些，待到我望不着那座古城，看不到那些田野與河流，聽不到洪亮而莊嚴的號角時，就只剩着我一個人，在崎嶇的山路上獨步行進。太陽爬上了天頂，變換了一道淡白色的强烈光芒。熾强</p>
<h3 id="c157">鬍子實錄 <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 强</p>
<p>偶然打了一個『欠伸』，張口舒出一肚皮閒氣的時候，眼眶裏也吹皺『一泓秋水』！（應該鄭重聲明的：這裏沒有秋波，凡我同胞，請釋錦注。）——當沒有伸手把面部據上一把之前，倒也覺得抗戰以來，精神一爽最感幽閒味的一瞬了。</p>
<p>可是情形並沒有這麽簡單。『三徑就荒！』立刻覺得上唇有些『棘手』，而且不無『跋扈』之處。</p>
<p>在深悔之餘，想起這一舉動，並非蓄意挑釁，或圖謀不軌：不過『欠伸』之後，似乎照例應該有這麼一手；最大努力，最終任務，也無非是按摩按摩，招撫變動後的肌肉，有無『就範』而已。</p>
<p>然而，這——非但多餘，委實是自尋煩惱，找出幾根不可收拾的愁絲，空來一陣悲切</p>
<p>『攬鏡』，沒有這個勇氣；『追踪』更其麻煩；雖然中國已經踏上一個大轉變的大時代，人們應該帶了十分十的『積極性』。而我，這回旣不『追踪』，而又懶於『攬鏡』，未免自暴自棄。其實，姑存此一格，庸何傷？况且『跋扈』由它『跋扈』，『火燭』我自『小心』之，亦不失為崗位上的一員。</p>
<p>提耙鬍子，說來話長，還覺得討厭。</p>
<p>回想淸黨運動時期，寄宿舍中，的確有幾個蓄着沒有『板眼』而且『格局』毫不『淸奇』的鬍子，受着嚴重的監視。問官感覺到犯罪證據不足，恨恨地盯了一眼。據說還發出這麽一個驚人的結諭：</p>
<p>『鬍子這樣——看行逕，安分總不是安分的！』</p>
<p>我那時候雖然想不到『司馬光』後來耍變成『馬克司』，不過自己往光光的唇板上一擄，『得天獨厚』，喜出望外而安心找一點課外讀物像『司馬光』的『資治通鑑』等類的書籍了。</p>
<p>然而每一想及那幾個爲了『不修邊幅』和幾根未就愛改編彷彿像黃鼠狼的鬍子的鬍子，未嘗不中心怦怦感覺到『救國應該小忘鬍子』了。</p>
<p>事實最雄辯，越加『不忘』，而鬍子也越加『跋扈』起來。半世浮沉，不可多得的幾點靑春派頭和一些蓬勃的『狂簡味』，却給幾根荒凉的鬍子掃去一大半。其實何必斤斤在這個形骸問題上兜圈子。</p>
<p>可是，朋友整整襟領，『廓淸門庭』，未嘗不想起根除鬍子『為當務之急』，以及『正本淸源，舍此莫屬』。據多數經騐家的報吿，認為比較可靠的標準手腕：與其勤於芟　於後，不如根本挖苗於前。因此：『刮不如剪；剪不如拔』；一串串聯珠式的理論的體系，油然產生。行動家握住這個『治本』的『百年大計』而大大的運用于對銅板，往各該唇板上『吹毛求疵』起來了。如果說『吃角子老虎』而有前因的話，那末，至少應該認定吃鬍子（老虎）的銅板是一條『一報還一報』的蛛絲馬跡了。</p>
<p>從統制經濟的提案通過之後，短短的一個時期裏，曾經鬧着一個硬質輔幣的不够流通市面的問題，向來運用銅板夾住鬍子來貫澈主張的朋友，也自然脫不了這毬經濟條件的　絆，不能不『面面相覬』而且『鰓鰓過慮』了。雖然娘姨或小大姐之流不無體卹鬍子的『沒有銅板泡開水』而輕易地從腰間掏出幾個來，作暫時救荒的挹注；然而用這個暖洋洋的銅板背地裏去拔鬍子，非但不會感覺得『柔情繾綣』，而且『銅臭』之外，作興還有『銅臭』。</p>
<p>物質條件，使多數靑年鬍子提起剪刀當機立决；但『橡皮膏布』，父跟踪則來。這雖然例外的遭逢，然而『綢繆未雨』，終於應該『將就』一點。</p>
<p>其實，這些事情，都是自尋煩惱，後來據有力的證明，說鬍子的短小精悍是促成一切『接吻』的原動力，這才使許多朋友醒悟回來，改變作風，把向來維持得牢牢的『剪』『拔』的主張，一律取消。而鬍子以前所受的生呑活剝和無謂的摧殘，也都得救回來，愛之欲其生，刮之欲其硬，頻繁是速决政策了。</p>
<p>然而我自己，依然是一個落伍者，『拔』的潮流，澎湃聲中，不追踪；『刮』的潮流變本加厲中，又不追跡。蔓草荒凉中找唇板，空留這塊荒蕪於人間，又有何益。</p>

<p>二毛子眉毛一挺，倐的跳將起來，手指直點他老婆的鼻上，怒吼似的：「放屁！你說什麽？你說什麽的！」</p>
<p>他老婆噤住了不作聲，低着頭，拍着懷裹的小孩喂乳。</p>
<p>小孩本來含着乳頭眼花瞇瞇的快將入睡，被他這一嚇，重又哭了起來。</p>
<p>「你怎麼不呌我去做强盜，做賊呢？不還乾凈些嗎！」</p>
<p>老婆仍不作聲，却抬起頭來對他盯了一眼，眼眶裏滿貯着淚水。</p>
<p>這倒使二毛子軟了下來。小孩子哭個不止，覺得室裏的空氣異常煩躁；二毛子推開窗子，吐着大氣兒的望着天空。</p>
<p>天空裏有月，有星，也有浮盪的流雲，可是在二毛子的眼裏，只是一片模糊。</p>
<p>好容易小孩子住了哭，老婆拍呀拍的放到床上去了。他方才回過頭來，望着她瘦削的背影，一年前衣服，活像掛在竹竿上似的了；禁不住一陣難過，長嘆一聲，默默的坐了下去。</p>
<p>老婆熊瞧他的臉色，緩緩的說道：「我不過同你商量商量，又不是一定呌你去的。………動不動就光那麽大火。你知道自己的脾氣近來壞到怎樣地步？……講到做强盜做賊，都是為了沒有飯吃；沒有見個有穿有喝的人去搶去偷的。但是走這條路的人，有許多却是很體面，很有聲價；醫如拿楊大爺來說吧，他難道少吃少穿？况且你去了也不過跟在他身邊當當差，又不是直接呌你當着　　人呌爺呌祖的去陪笑臉。也是劉二哥好意，巴巴的跑來邀你，不去呢，他怕沒有別的朋友？人家謀都謀不到呢！」微微的嘆口氣，「你這樣的脾氣，要是劉二哥知道了，人家的臉子下得去嗎？」</p>
<p>「你曉得什麽？偏有那麼許多歪理的！」</p>
<p>「我原同你說過是商量商量的呀。……並不又是我急你，房租三個月不付了，家裏的柴，米，零用，那一天少得來！吃盡當光，借叉沒處借！……你的脾氣，我怕不知道，耍是勉强能過，我也早替你回了，誰不要抬着頭兒做人的！」頓一會兒，「所以我想我們該有個過日子的辦法，總不能開着眼睛等餓死呀！」一</p>
<p>二毛子皺着眉尖，沒有回答。</p>
<p>室內的空氣，又顯得十分沉悶。</p>
<p>抉梯上一陣皮鞋聲，走上來一個人。</p>
<p>「二毛哥！」</p>
<p>噢，劉二哥！」老婆趕着回答，讓進房來。</p>
<p>二毛子打了一聲招呼，見劉二身上穿着一套新的衣褲，不由的心裹起了一陣厭惡。</p>
<p>料不到劉二坐下來時，也嘆了一口氣：「唉！沒有事兒的時候，一個大錢都借不到；聽說有了差使啦，一借就二十元；還問我够不够呢！你們想，自己的娘舅都這麽勢利的！」</p>
<p>「啊，二哥，你也太難弄了，借又不好，不借又不好。」老婆又搶先說着。</p>

<p>人們的慾　是沒有止境的，尤其是一般志高氣傲的靑年們！祗知道羨慕，懊惱！不知道『知足者常樂』這幾個字。要曉得我們誠然要時求發展，但决不會一舉即能如意，我們應一面利用機會或留心機會，一面還要時常保持樂觀的態度與精神，這樣，我們始可聊以自慰。不信的話，我們就把我們衣，食，住，行而言，就可了然了！</p>
<p>當我們在穿衣服的時候，一定常想穿二三塊錢一尺的綢緞，或是一百多元一身的西裝，但是不，我們决不可有這種妄想。我們祇要有普通的衣服，可以抵抗塞冷，保護身體也就够了。何况於比較那無屋可住，無衣可穿的難民，或是衣衫襤褸的化子，那眞要好得多了。</p>
<p>當我們在吃飯的時候，一定常想吃西餐，嘗魚翅，海參等珍品，但是不，我們祇要適口，合衛生，可以飽肚子也就好了。這樣，比較那沒得吃的，或是沿門求乞的，巳好得多了。</p>
<p>當我們住在屋裏，睡在硬鋪板上的時候，一定常想住高樓大厦，或是西式洋房，睡的最好是席夢思的彈簧床，但是不，我們祗要可以避風雨，能令眠，合衛生好了。比那沒得住所，躱在衖堂裹，睡在水門汀上的，可眞要好得多了。</p>
<p>當我們坐在電車裹的時候，見二旁飛馳着的流綫型的汽車，心中也恨不得能出門坐汽車，進門坐汽車；但是若想起一天到晚為生活而奔跑的黃包車夫，塌車夫，那眞更幸運得多了。</p>
<h3 id="c160">我國旗袍　流行海外 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 飛飛</p>
<p>我國一般人之喜穿西服，據那些喜穿西服的人說有兩種理由：　意在炫奇學時，似乎穿了西裝革履，才能够顯出自己是一個摩登人物。　取其便利活潑，因為西服不但在形式上好看，而且比了長袍輕便爽快。然而相反的，有些外國人却愛穿中國服裝；譬如美國的婦女，有不少歡喜穿着中國的旗抱，伊們算是出風頭的。因此，近年來我國的絲織品，在美國銷路很好，但可惜美國的進口稅太高，像絲織品及顧綉　一類東西，抽稅竟達百分之百二十以上，為了這個原因，我國的絲織品輸美頗感困難。同樣的，日本的婦女界也頗多愛　中國旗袍，並且非常盛行呢。</p>
<p>講到日本的服裝，其形式派頭猶沿守着我國唐宋時代的遣風，像這種衣服，非但不便利，而且十分累贅，女性的曲綫美及活潑姿態，亦被它遮掩無遺，實在非常難看。因着這個緣故，幾年來日本的婦女界也曾提倡改良服裝，司是終為了積重難返，所以毫不見效。於是，我國的旗袍却在東京流行起來了。起先，愛穿旗袍的不過是那些藝妓咖啡座女侍等；在最近幾年中，其範圍已愈見推廣，一般新劇演員，電影明星，甚至貴挨婦女們，也都競相穿着，並且漸漸地，這喜穿中國旗袍之風，便吹遍了島國。</p>
<p>但是有一點覺得遺憾，就是日本婦女雖然愛穿中國旗袍，在東京却沒有一家專製中國服裝的成衣店，雖則我們中國人也有幾家洋服店在東京開設着，然而只會做西裝，中國衣服呌他們做起來反而不大高明了，允其是旗袍，其式樣要是在上海人眼中看起來，那應該是落伍的。否則，如果在東京也有幾家專門製中國裝的時裝裁縫店，能够像匕海一樣的推陳出新的話，我相信中國旗袍在日本還要風行一時呢。</p>

<p>— 茜夢</p>
<p>做大事業的人，往往愈會把日常的生活，看的最輕鬆，不介意，實行的也最簡單；事實上，他們把精神用到了大處，就難兼顧瑣屑。</p>
<p>所以希特勒就是沒有例外的一個，他不斤斤較量於衣食住行的一切，特別對於食，更隨便，什麼菜他都吃得來，而且吃的有味，這就更難了！</p>
<p>他不吸烟，也不飲酒，就是說他沒有惡的嗜好；一天中有時祗吃了午餐晚餐二頓；這樣决定了他食量的可驚，他能把二决用的菜在一下子吃完！不過，在許多菜之中，鷄蛋就佔了他食量的大部份，就是他最喜歡吃鷄蛋，他時常吃各式各樣燒法的鷄蛋；他有一個專鬥的廚司，能够有三十多種方法來燒鷄蛋，若在他需要參加一個集會的時候，他必命廚司親自把鷄蚤和一片片的黑絲鰵帶去燒；他在獨個子吃的時候，就很簡單的讓蛋煮沸一下，這就算是他特選的食料了！不過他也常吃魚，鷄，生菜，　　和牛油同煮的蔬菜；總之，他的膳食是冉隨便也沒有的！</p>
<p>在這種營養之下，他漸漸的發胖，體力也逐漸加重了，兩個下頷慢慢的在掛下來，腹部亦在發生異樣傾斜的活躍，這對他太憂慮了，因為他還想永遠做德國的獨裁者，甚至做全世界的；但是，這樣對他的野心，也太有害了！</p>
<p>俾尼多是很明瞭一個偉大領袖的精神，對於食物的嗜好，是具着極密切的關係的，所以他曾像下定理一般的說過：「有野心的人是絕對不允許吃多量的牛排的」！</p>
<p>希特勒的睡眠時間是下午十時，他時常說：「不充足或太多的休息，無論是肉體上或精神上，都是無益於人生的，允其對於有大志的人」！</p>
<p>吃的消息吳人嗜小食，早點喜以湯糰充飢，蓋可以隨食量之大小，而多寡之。昔戰前南市喬家栅中，有一肆，因製湯　而得名。其所製之湯　，肉餡堅而實，其粉滑而糯，嚙之則肉湯四濺，味美絕倫。一般老饕。每嚙去其皮，而留其肉餡，再加綫粉若干，用以佐餐，儼然一碗綫粉肉元湯矣。又有抽筋菜圓子一種，在卅年前祗城內三牌樓某肆有出售，以齋菜去筋，揀其嫩葉，再加精製而成，入口淸香酥滑，鮮腴可口，在近年來絕未見他肆有出售者。近聞喬家柵湯糰肆，日內已在亞爾倍路二七六號復業，且亦有菜圓子出售，電話送貨七三〇五〇號，一般老饕，又可一飽口福矣。</p>

<p>— 張鎮山</p>
<p>德高望重的林主席，雖然是有這麼大的年齡，雖然是貴為國民政府的主席，但是，他個人的私生活却不因年事高大而求舒適，優美；也不因職位尊高而傲僈，自私，他沒有虛偽，沒有殘忍，也不懦弱，也不孤僻；他總是那麼正直，儉樸，溫和，慈祥，充分地表示出我們中華民族固有的美德！</p>
<p>不論是辦公的時候或者家居休息的時候，他總是長袍短褂的裝束，春天，就是一件藍綢的薄棉袍，夏天，就穿一件白夏布長衫，秋天，就是一件薄絲棉袍，外加馬褂，冬天，就是一件羊皮袍，外加一件黑呢大　；在春秋冬三個季節裏，他總要在長袍之外再加一件藍布罩衫，藉以遮護長袍的淸潔。每逢到國府集會或各耍人宴請時，才臨時將罩衫脫去，所以他老人家常穿的衣服總是那麽的整潔。遇到有隆重的典禮！例如元旦授勳，及各國大使呈遞國書時，他就換穿一身簇新的藍綢長袍和黑緞馬褂的國服。在這些衣服之中，其質料絕對都是國貨，近三十年來他不曾買過一點舶來品，這也是一般人所沒有的優點。</p>
<p>他日常的食品，和普通人比較却沒有什麼分別，幾樣蔬菜，一碗白飯，一碗薄粥，蔬菜中以豆腐鷄蛋為最多，不過，他對於食物有一個標準，那就是：「滾，爛，淡。」能够在這三個條件下的食物，他才可以吃。</p>
<p>什麼呌做「滾爛淡」呢？「滾就是熱，無論什麼食品，消退了熱度的總不吃，「爛」就是熟與軟的意思，蔬菜必須經長時間的溫火煮爛，這也許是因為牙齒的關係不適宜服用硬質食料的緣故吧？「淡」就是不　，因為食品過於緘了，食後必然的口舌不爽而要飮多量的水以致腸胃膨脹，這也是衛生上一個値得注意的問題。</p>
<p>他公館裏的佈置是非常簡樸的，臥室眞和普通人的臥室差不多，一張床，一張方桌，一張書案，二椅一茶几；休息，起臥，看書報，批閱私人函件，都在這間小室中，他因為愛好古玩的緣故，公館裏也擺設一些琴棋書畫，瓶劍爐缸等等，書案上擺的一隻小瓶，還是他自己徒步在古董店裏買來的。</p>
<p>說到主席的行，在南京時我們是不大看到他走長路的，因此，我們總以為他因年高力衰而不能多走吧？其實不然，中央每屆開大會及總理生日謁陵時，他也是徒步的，那麽長的中山路，那麽多的陵前石級，他都能走，並且，還能走下石級，走回到官邸，只須稍事休息，就可恢復未走前的神態，表面上他雖然是年高的長者，但其實，他却有靑年一般的精神和腿力。</p>
<p>去年在廣西時，他和李宗仁將軍，白崇禧將軍，黃旭初將軍，及其他高級長官等，同遊桂林山水，他也走了不少的路，並且，愈走愈興奮，那麽淸秀的風景眞使他忘却了脚部的疲乏。「桂林山水甲天下，眞是不錯！」和而强健的音浪時時對着山水讚羨，同時，也一程又一程的走着。</p>
<p>末了，我們遙祝他老人家精神矍　，壽逾期頣，永遠愉快地調度國事！</p>

<p>舞蹈姿態就隨著內容的轉變的。所以，欣賞舞蹈應　其內容與其姿態對比，比如古典主義舞蹈的內容是宗敎的崇拜，那就要看其姿態是吾有那末嚴肅、典雅與樸實，同時，還須聯繫起舞蹈與其所由產生的民族特性來看，譬如德國的舞，看牠的錢條是吾粗悍？法國的舞的姿態秀麗不秀麗？英國的舞老氣不老氣？以及俄國的舞大方不大方？</p>
<p>四、舞臺與燈光</p>
<p>燈光是增加舞臺舞的特殊効果的。譬如我們看着「巴斯達收穫舞一利用的黃紅色的燈先與舞蹈者面部表情，似乎就顯出是一羣農民在太陽光下一動一動而且歡笑地收穫。那末，我們除了看舞蹈者的姿態以外，還得欣賞其利用的燈光的情調如何？若一幕歡樂活潑的舞蹈配置的是沉悶的燈光，那就看得出其姿態的效果會减到水平綫以下的。</p>
<p>五、舞蹈與音樂伴奏</p>
<p>舞蹈的步伐完全依賴昔樂節奏的推動，因此音樂成為舞蹈的客觀要索，那麽音樂的利川須適應舞蹈的情趣與背景，吾則，不但舞蹈效果會不健全，而且也會减低舞蹈者的情緒的。所以，舞蹈昔樂的配置，不可只求節奏的和諧，還應使彼此的情趣調和，而且一幕舞蹈當有特為牠作的音樂，不然會貽害其效果的。訊得幾年以前北平六國飯店大禮堂一位中國女舞蹈者跳的一幕名「希臘女神舞一和一位男舞蹈者跳的「西班牙騎士舞」，所配置的音樂完全離開了原舞蹈的情趣，而且這音樂正是我所知道的。因為這音樂非舞蹈音樂而是近代的純昔樂，把純音樂去配置「騎土」與「女神」的姿態動作，那無異於吾認了音樂與舞蹈的連環性。因此，我們對於舞蹈本身的賞鑑以外，還須對音樂的配置加以考察。</p>
<p>六、舞蹈的動作</p>
<p>舞蹈動作的綫條也是被其內容所决定的。十六七世紀人的生活注重形式，所以，古典舞的綫條也是側重於小姿態的形式美，所謂細綫條舞，同時，這時代的各種舞蹈，都是從共通步伐之基本原則下創立的。十八世紀提倡人的個性發展，所以，浪漫舞的錢條盡量使其個別化，動作也更自由，十九世紀舞蹈受印象主義的影響，於是其動作專求綫條的糢糊。至於現代，因為要求力的表現，於是舞蹈的綫條與姿態專在輪廓的大動作着眼，所謂立體粗綫條的舞蹈，同時以集體舞為單位。於是可知賞鑑舞蹈應與其內容對看的。</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>東皋公擅換容術</p>
<p>此外還有一層難處，就是唱。打。拉。三個人都要合得來，三人中倘有一位稍快或稍慢，那就得碰的個亂七八糟。（唱角最忌與塲面碰上，他碰準得脫）。以上所論，尙係僅僅關於唱的部分，要講到表情，更非易事。因為子胥雖懷有父母兄長的大仇，可惜在這鞠戲裏沒有個人或物的對象，讓他來痛痛快快的發洩一下。所以凡是吹鬍子，瞪眼睛等等的作工，一些都用不上去。戲中沒有對象的表情，最不易作；當初汪桂芬就是好在全成兩隻大眼睛，他能將滿腹憤恨之氣，完全在眉目之間，表現出來，無怪此剝惟為他的絕唱了。</p>
<p>唱戲最怕死臉子「沒眼睛」死臉子就是不論喜。怒。哀。樂。悲。悸。驚。愁。全是那一副面孔，沒眼睛就是天生的眼睛小，不能傳神，雖有兩眼，簡直在台上沒有甚麼用處，這樣謂之沒眼睛，並不是同瞎子一般的什麽全瞧不見，要眞是如此，那又怎能登台演戲呢？以前老譚也就是吃虧在眼睛小，沒有殺氣，所好的他臉上有戲，尙無大碍。但是他自知藏拙，因此「昭關」這戲，巷是不肯動牠，現在譚派老生除菊朋外，別人都不大演唱，也是因為無從遵循的緣故。</p>
<p>一般人聽　文昭關，總以為伍子胥的鬍鬚是愁白的，就是不佞問過幾位內行的名宿，他們也一致是如此說法。某年遇到一位老顧曲家，席間他忽然提出這個問題，把同桌的入都給問住。最後他才發表他的高見道：一據我說子胥的鬍鬚，是東皋公施的換容術，纔將伍明輔的鬍鬚變白。試看東皋公的報名，他自言幼年並拜扁鵲先生門下為徒，及見子胥時，復父把他的貴老師提起，速他當年在朝曾任何職都未嘗道及，這也可見臯公之重視其師了。扁鵲乃古之名醫，眞具起死回生之術，皋公如此敬重老師，他的醫學，也就可想而知。他把子胥留在後花園中，一連七日未與會面，却在飮食中加了催老的藥餌，並於夜　隔窗探視子胥的容顏已否改變。子胥本來大仇在心，當然愁眉不展，臯公藥石奏效，復益以子胥之焦急憂慮，二者合力進攻，故能在短短的七日之中，將鬚髮全行變白。戲詞中雖未明言皋公開藥之事，但楚聽戲的却不能不來仔細揣摩一下，古人作書編戲，常好賣個關子，打個啞謎，焉知編這齣戲的不是打個啞謎讓後人猜呢　。不佞因這位戲迷說得很有點道理，所以才把臯公的神術，也宣佈一下」。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing dispatch: The improvement of national administration is currently under detailed discussion by responsible parties. The main points are to adapt to the war of resistance as the highest principle. The status of war zone provincial chairmen, who will concurrently manage military and political affairs, will be elevated and changed to specially appointed officials. The treatment of county magistrates will also be improved. Only two or three provinces have submitted the list of members for the provincial temporary advisory councils on time, and most have not completed the preparations in time. The authorities have decided to uniformly postpone the establishment to March 2nd. (Special dispatch at 5 PM on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The National Government spokesman announced today while receiving newspaper reporters that Zhang Qun will soon hold an important position in the central government. Military Commission Chairman's Offices will soon be established in Chengdu and Xikang. The Chongqing office will be abolished because the commission is already located in Chongqing. The establishment of the office in Xikang is due to the increasingly important status of the province. The original military spokesman, Xu Peigen, will be replaced by Yang Xuancheng (transliteration). Yang previously studied at the Naval Academy in the United Kingdom as a government appointee.

<p>In recent days, there has been a tendency for Britain and the United States to jointly adopt a tough stance on Japan's attempts to close the door to China. Yesterday, a Reuters dispatch from London stated that Britain and the United States have exchanged views on the Far East issue. Although the content is unknown, according to general observation, the two countries have already made the same decisions based on the same facts. Some retaliatory actions against Japan can be expected to be adopted. The US Congress is currently discussing the issue of sanctions against Japan and neutrality laws that could affect the Sino-Japanese War. British Prime Minister Chamberlain has also stated that his attitude towards the Far East issue will shift with the attitude of the United States. If the amendment to the US sanctions against Japan and the neutrality law can be established, then the currently reported issue of economic retaliation against Japan can immediately become a reality. In the dark and chaotic current situation in the Far East, this action by Britain and the United States will open up a new situation.</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, the Sino-Japanese War has reached a critical juncture. Britain and the United States want to preserve their rights and interests in the Far East and maintain world justice and peace. Given the current war situation and the domestic environment of Britain and the United States, now is the most appropriate time to impose economic retaliation against Japan. In terms of the Far East, since China entered the second stage of the War of Resistance, its military position has become increasingly favorable, and its political situation has become increasingly clear due to the purging of compromise and wavering elements. If Britain and the United States implement economic retaliation against Japan at this time, it will directly oppose the infringement of rights and interests by fascism, and indirectly strengthen China's strength in the War of Resistance, which will shorten the period for China to achieve final victory. The current Japan is at a loss in the war of aggression against China, and the large outflow of gold, the rapid decline in foreign trade, the rise in prices, and the increase in unemployment have already caused the entire economy to begin to collapse. Now, if Britain and the United States can take this opportunity to impose economic pressure on Japan, it will naturally be enough to force Japan to stop its aggression.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan's aggressive actions in China, due to the increasingly unfavorable domestic and international situation, are intensifying their efforts to exclude European and American forces in China and expand the scope of aggression. Not long ago, Japan brazenly declared the so-called "establishing a new order in China," and recently there has been the factual manifestation of blockading the ports of North China. Japan's ambitions in the Far East are by no means satisfied with seizing China, as many facts can prove. The Japanese press also openly stated at the end of last year that Japan should seize Hong Kong, Singapore, India, and other places. If Britain and the United States do not take timely measures to prevent the development of Japan's ambitions, once the aggressors are fully developed, not only will Britain and the United States be unable to preserve their rights and interests in China and other countries in the Far East, but it will also be impossible for them to maintain their own peace. This may also be the reason that has prompted them to realize that they must jointly impose economic sanctions on Japan!</p>
<p>In terms of the situation of Britain and the United States themselves, the British public has always held a sympathetic attitude towards China's War of Resistance, while the government has often wanted to compromise with the aggressors from a realistic perspective. However, the British government's compromise policy has ultimately been greatly disappointed. Now, the demands of the general public in Britain for economic sanctions against Japan are very urgent. For example, British expatriates in China have twice telegraphed the government, requesting that they take effective measures to protect their rights and interests in China! Domestic bankers and exporters are also trying to get the government to change its compromise policy. Even the British government has realized that it must change its attitude on Far East policy. They know that Britain's investment of 250 million pounds in China can no longer obtain a safe guarantee from compromise. For example, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, in which Britain has investment relations, has long been operating under the control of the Japanese army. Not only are the British not allowed to intervene, but even British requests to inspect are rejected. This is a good lesson for the British government. Therefore, after US President Roosevelt made a speech criticizing aggressive behavior, British Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately expressed his approval in a written statement and immediately convened cabinet members to consider increasing tariffs on Japanese goods and granting preferential economic treatment to China. This shows that the British government has also recognized that only by adopting economic retaliation measures can they effectively protect their rights and interests in China.</p>
<p>As for the US government and people, they have always had a very enthusiastic support for China's War of Resistance. Although a few isolationists have expressed opposition in the past, they have gradually changed their attitude as the Japanese aggression and atrocities continue to unfold. For example, the amount of military supplies that the United States shipped to aggressive countries in the past was very large, but after US Secretary of State Hull dissuaded them, it has now been greatly reduced. President Roosevelt's amendment to the neutrality law, which he decided to propose in Congress, is undoubtedly a positive expression of support for the work of assisting China. And now it has received the support of general public opinion. The 750,000 members of the American Peace and Democracy Association have jointly written to the government requesting a ban on arms shipments and the suspension of credit loans to aggressive countries, which shows that the US government and people have gradually reached a consensus on the issue of economic retaliation against Japan.</p>
<p>Since the necessity and trend of joint Anglo-American economic retaliation against Japan are now so obvious, the major issue at present is the question of specific implementation methods. We know that the private material profits that general financial capitalists pay attention to may not always be in response to the policies of great statesmen with far-sighted vision. And the close economic relations between various British and American colonies and Japan are sufficient to make economic retaliation difficult in practice. We can only hope that far-sighted statesmen in Britain and the United States, such as Roosevelt, Hull, Eden, and Iri Pengke, will make a few more appeals to the British and American people and mobilize the strength of the masses, which can always be effective!</p>

<h3 id="e22">Chen Cheng Reports on One Week of War Situation <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chen Cheng reported on one week of war situation (from January 1st to 8th), stating that the enemy's internal social situation is showing signs of unrest. The true face of their outwardly strong but inwardly weak state is about to be revealed. The collapse of the Konoe Cabinet is a sign of this. Therefore, their national warlords are scrambling around, on one hand spreading rumors of peaceful atmosphere, and on the other hand actively mobilizing their long-battled and exhausted soldiers, hoping to cut off our international transportation lines in Guangzhou and Shanxi. However, everyone knows their intentions. They cannot deceive us. Regardless of their strategies, tactics, or political strategies, the more the enemy tries to penetrate our interior, the more difficulties they will face, and the deeper they penetrate, the more beneficial it will be for us. We have infinite power to deal with their petty antics. Now that the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun, the Japanese invaders have penetrated deep into our interior. We will not only prevent them from advancing further, but also launch a general counter-offensive along the entire front, drive the Japanese invaders out of our territory, and restore our beautiful homeland. We hope that people around the world who sympathize with justice will watch with bated breath. The general overview of this week's war situation is recorded as follows: In Guangdong, the main force of the enemy in Guangdong, numbering over 20,000, is still concentrated in the suburbs of Guangzhou, and no active action has been discovered. However, they have been busy building fortifications in the suburbs of Guangzhou, as if they intend to hold Guangzhou firmly. The highway from Huaxian to Taipingchang has been destroyed by the Japanese army, which proves the ugly state of the Japanese army fearing the southward attack of the Chinese army. The Japanese army on the Guangcong Highway was intercepted by a unit of the Chinese attacking team near Shupu in Taipingchang on the afternoon of the 31st, killing a Japanese Lieutenant Noberu and more than twenty soldiers, and seizing many rifles and military supplies. Subsequently, thousands of Japanese troops advanced from Taipingchang to Dagangling Shuicao on the morning of the 1st. More than a hundred people arrived at Shabei Village at noon, three hundred people near Chicao, five hundred people near Dengcun, and over four hundred cavalrymen and artillerymen in the Doger area of Sandong, bombarding the Chinese positions with hundreds of shells to cover the infantry's advance. They fought fiercely with the Chinese army until the morning of the 2nd. The Japanese were defeated and retreated along the highway. In this battle, over a hundred Japanese were killed, and the Chinese casualties were only over twenty. The Japanese troops in Zengcheng and Shetouling were attacked by a Chinese attacking team on the night of the 1st. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted by relying on fortifications. The fierce battle continued until midnight, when the Japanese army in Shetouling was surrounded. Another unit broke into the North Gate of Zengcheng and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army. On the morning of the 2nd, a large Japanese force rushed to aid from Shitan Guangzhou. The Chinese army retreated to its original position after the mission was completed. In this battle, the Japanese casualties in Shetouling were over ninety, and more than twenty rifles and other steel helmets and gas masks were seized. In Zengcheng, seventy Japanese troops were killed. In both places, the Chinese army suffered a total of two platoon leaders and more than ten soldiers killed and wounded. On the night of the 1st, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army at the Jiujiang Estuary in Nanhe, seizing two machine guns and over seventy boxes of gasoline. The Japanese suffered more than ten casualties. In short, the Japanese army on the periphery of Guangzhou suffered attacks from all directions by the Chinese army on the day of the New Year's Day alone, suffering heavy losses and experiencing a lot of fluster. As for Beihai Weizhou Island, three Japanese warships arrived, including an aircraft carrier. Three hundred Japanese soldiers have landed on Weizhou Island, committing adultery, looting, and doing all kinds of evil, causing the people to suffer unspeakably.

<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the declaration made by Wen Zongyao, the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan of the Reorganized National Government, demanding that the people accept Konoe's peace proposal, the Chinese government spokesman stated that this fact is not worth commenting on. Wen is known as the most corrupt official of the former Beijing government era. He is an opium addict himself, and his daughter is a woman of ill-repute who was arrested in New York a few years ago for trafficking drugs from Shanghai to the United States. Therefore, any declaration made by Wen is not worth arguing against. The Chinese government is determined to continue the war of resistance. The spokesman further pointed out that the "Reorganized National Government's" claim that its judicial power has reached twelve provinces of mainland China is a deceptive tale. In fact, its judicial power cannot extend beyond the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai, and even the New Asia Hotel is under the protection of the Japanese army. (Eleventh Day, Associated Press)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Sun Ke, the Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, stated in a speech here yesterday that the Soviet Union has not yet taken any unilateral military action against Japan to aid China's war of resistance. The reasons for this are no more than the following: First, China did not conclude a military alliance with the Soviet Union before the war; Second, the Soviet Union's established policy is to obtain peace through collective security. After criticizing those who hoped that Germany and Italy would mediate the Sino-Japanese War, Sun added that our country's foreign policy is an open policy, that is, to closely cooperate with Britain, the United States, and France. In fact, the Soviet Union also hopes that our country will closely cooperate with Britain, the United States, and France. If the Soviet Union takes unilateral action, it will give Japan an opportunity to prove that its invasion of China is an effort to prevent the Soviet Union from dominating the Far East. Furthermore, it may arouse the suspicion of Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, if the democratic countries cannot form a unified front, the Soviet Union will not take unilateral action in the Far East. Sun finally urged the Chinese people to have faith and determination, and to rely on their own abilities to resist Japanese aggression. (Eleventh Day, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Sun Ke, Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, gave a speech here on January 7, revealing many facts that have not been publicly announced in Sino-Soviet relations in the past two years. According to reports, the Soviet Union agreed to go to war with Japan under the following three conditions: (1) The League of Nations implements sanctions against Japan. Since the Soviet Union is a member state of the League of Nations, it will naturally fulfill its obligations. (2) If the League of Nations cannot implement sanctions, then there must be a joint understanding between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly resist Japanese military. (3) If the powers cannot reach an understanding, then the Soviet Union can only go to war with Japan if Japan invades Soviet territory. Sun also stated that the former Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, submitted three proposals to the Chinese government when he returned to China from Moscow before the outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident: (1) China proposes to convene a Pacific Peace Conference; (2) China and the Soviet Union sign a treaty of non-aggression; (3) China and the Soviet Union sign a mutual assistance agreement. After careful consideration, the Chinese government believed that the Pacific Peace Conference would not be very effective because Japan might not participate. Later, due to the outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the proposal to convene a Pacific Peace Conference was naturally canceled. The Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty was signed in August 1937, but negotiations on the Sino-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement have not yet begun, because the conclusion of this agreement before the war is completely different from the situation after the war. If the mutual assistance agreement had been concluded before the Lugou Bridge Incident, it could have prevented the war. But after the war, this agreement would immediately force the Soviet Union to fight Japan. Last year, as the European situation became increasingly tense, the Soviet Union could not fight on both the eastern and western fronts at the same time, so it had to adopt a less active policy in the Far East, and its assistance to China could only be limited to spiritual diplomacy and material aspects. Sun continued to express his belief in China's final victory, saying that at the time of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the total number of Chinese troops was only one million, but now it has increased to 240 divisions. When the Chinese and Japanese armies fought near Shanghai, the ratio of casualties was five to one. The Battle of Xuzhou has been reduced to a ratio of three to one. In the Yangtze River Campaign, the ratio of casualties on both sides is almost equal. In the guerrilla warfare in North China, the ratio of casualties between the two armies is three to one for the enemy and one for us. As for the Shanxi Province, this ratio is even more favorable to China, that is, for every one of us who dies, the enemy must suffer fourteen and a half casualties. (Eleventh Day, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) A certain diplomat who has just returned from the United States told our reporter that the American government and the public have clearly shown sympathy for us, and the attitude of the bourgeoisie has also become stronger because (1) Japan excludes American interests in China, and (2) Japan's cash reserves have decreased by three-quarters and are no longer the best customers. In the future, Britain and the United States will further cooperate, because the British-American business has been signed, and the war debt problem has recently been resolved. Therefore, they will adopt parallel policies and will not shirk each other. This can already be seen in general in the loan to China. In terms of naval cooperation, it is even more worthy of deep belief. Britain has decided to set up a Far East Fleet and strengthen the Singapore base. The United States has also set up an independent Pacific Fleet, but the formation of a fleet must include 125 to 136 warships of all levels. The British and American naval expansion plans will be completed within two or three years. At that time, Japan can be dealt with arbitrarily. Why should we actively seek peace? Even if Britain and the United States want to help us, there is not enough time. (Eleventh Day, 11:00 PM Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Sexual Hygiene: Premature Aging - Methods to Enhance Energy in Severe Winter <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>—Yang Daonan, Graduate of Medical Science from Russian Labour University</p>
<p>Many men, due to ignorance of hygiene or bad habits, weaken their metabolic functions, leading to a decline in spirit and body despite their relatively young age. The condition known as kidney deficiency is often a result of premature aging. In theory, young men should have abundant primordial yang energy and should not experience such problems. However, due to indulgence and excessive desires, their reproductive capacity gradually declines while they are still young. They are unable to exert their full energy, which is a symptom of kidney deficiency.</p>
<p>Normally, this unfortunate phenomenon occurs after middle age due to the natural decline in physiology, leading to the aging of the sex glands. Generally, a healthy male's sex glands are highly active around the age of twenty, but by middle age, their strength wanes and they become ineffective. However, if hygiene is neglected, this condition can develop even before middle age, which is a tragedy.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the essence of the sex glands (i.e., the testicles) of a strong animal can be introduced into the human body, it can promote their activity, relieve premature aging, restore their original energy, and achieve rejuvenation. This is the latest invention in modern medicine: organ therapy.</p>
<p>For example, a forty-year-old man who feels his energy declining can delay the onset of these issues by at least ten years through this therapy. Clinical results have proven its effectiveness.</p>
<p>Youth Gland Extract, "Bu Ti Kang" for men, has a long history of use in organ therapy. We doctors have correctly recognized its medicinal power. The effects begin within one hour, and it invigorates the kidneys within 24 hours, providing several major functions such as activating the nerves and tonifying the kidneys, blood, and brain. Whether the patient suffers from premature ejaculation, neurasthenia, premature aging, underdevelopment, or infertility after marriage, "Bu Ti Kang" can restore youthful vigor. Out of a thousand cases, there are almost no disappointments.</p>
<p>Premature aging and kidney deficiency can not only weaken the love between couples, but also lead to lifelong infertility if suffered early in life.</p>
<p>Reproductive ability is directly proportional to health. Therefore, people with premature aging and kidney deficiency should actively take Youth Gland Extract, "Bu Ti Kang" for men, to not only exert healthy reproductive power but also gradually improve their overall health.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Harmless Home Remedies for Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The earlier one is infected with the bad habit of masturbation, the deeper the damage. The more frequent the bad habit, the more severe the physical and mental damage. After excessive masturbation, frequent nocturnal emissions and the essence and blood produced by physiology are not sufficient for new metabolism, and the brain, sex organs, and spinal cord suffer from hundreds of neurological diseases, resulting in memory loss, headaches, tinnitus, palpitations, lack of energy, premature ejaculation, impotence, and lower back pain. If one indulges in masturbation during development, one may lose the ability to develop properly.</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission from masturbation is not an incurable disease. If the symptoms are mild and there are no adverse effects, they will automatically disappear after marriage. If there is excessive masturbation or frequent spermatorrhea and nocturnal emissions, it should be treated quickly. First, it is especially important to abstain from masturbation, engage in noble games, clear the mind and reduce desires. It is very easy to correct the bad habit of masturbation. Then, take "Nai Er Si Anti-Spermatorrhea Tablets", three tablets each night before bed with warm water, to stop nocturnal emission that night. At the same time, use Youth Gland Extract, "Bu Ti Kang" for men, made from testicular essence, to nourish the losses. Pay attention to health, and you can restore your original health within a short period of time. This home remedy is not only economical and simple, but also effective and harmless.

<h3 id="e32">Do Not Be Penny Wise and Pound Foolish <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>The claim of curing leucorrhea in a few days has been shattered by the facts.</p>
<p>Recently, the treatment of common gonorrhea has become confusing. Due to my clinical duties, patients often seek my treatment, and most of them tell me that they were misled by over-the-counter medicines that claim to cure in three to five days. After taking one or two courses, it is still like throwing a stone into the sea, losing money without benefit, and the pain is even deeper. It is really a case of being penny wise and pound foolish. In reality, they are still made of old and inferior materials, such as cubeb and sandalwood oil. They are disguised with the name of some new ingredient, truly attempting to "resurrect the dead." In fact, these patients, who have no medical knowledge, do not think about how gonorrhea can be cured in three to five days. Even with the "606" for syphilis, it is impossible to eradicate it in three to five days. We say that there are effective medicines for gonorrhea that can be cured. However, to say that these effective medicines can cure it completely in three to five days is nothing but deception. Fortunately, the inferior over-the-counter medicines that claim to cure in a few days have been shattered by these ironclad facts. There is no room for hesitation.</p>
<p>Now we are guiding patients towards the path of light with accurate scientific knowledge. Among the internal medicines for gonorrhea that are tested by time, "Ke Lin Nong," invented by Dr. Peter, a master of gonorrhea from Germany, is the most effective. Because Dr. Peter, with his natural talent and hard work, spent more than 30 years of research, based on the principle of non-specific therapy, invented and adopted a protein-chromophore mixture to make "Ke Lin Nong." Its efficacy has been precisely analyzed and tested by Dr. Hi Hare, a famous clinical experimentalist of gonorrhea. He knows that after each gonorrhea patient takes "Ke Lin Nong," the cells are stimulated by the medicinal power of "Ke Lin Nong," which produces a subtle effect of anti-gonorrhea and sterilization. Therefore, whether it is the initial stage of gonorrhea or those who have not been cured by taking other gonorrhea medicines for a long time, taking "Ke Lin Nong" can definitely cure it. However, it is not comparable to ordinary over-the-counter medicines. Because "Ke Lin Nong" is determined by the severity of the condition and the depth of the disease to determine its cure period, not generally saying that it can be cured in three to five days, because the correct gonorrhea special medicine can not make unreasonable publicity. It must be shown to people with the word "efficacy" in order to convince the patients, because facts speak louder than words. We cannot use deceptive words like hanging sheep's heads and selling dog meat to try the patients.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Gonorrhea Rhapsody <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan, Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>How can one say that leucorrhea is completely cured?</p>
<p>Treating gonorrhea should not miss a single thing.</p>
<p>Treating a kind of sexually transmitted disease, an experienced physician will not only take care of the patient's own condition, but also make complete preparations for their relatives. For example, a married man who has gonorrhea will find it difficult for his wife to remain celibate and avoid the ravages of gonorrhea, because gonorrhea is highly contagious and can be transmitted even with occasional contact. How can couples who sleep in the same bed avoid the attack of gonorrhea? Therefore, at this time, the physician must give the patient moral guidance. If, unfortunately, both husband and wife are infected, it is better to treat them at the same time, so that there is no omission, repeated infections, and it will be difficult to cure. Therefore, the only solution must be to treat both parties at the same time. For example, the man has completely cured gonorrhea, but does not pay attention to his wife's gonorrhea, and then becomes infected again due to sexual relations.</p>
<p>Husband and wife can only cohabit if they are free of poison.</p>
<p>According to our experience, dealing with such gender-specific gonorrhea is not difficult. Whether it is the initial stage of gonorrhea in men, or a long-term history of more than ten years of gonorrhea, you can generally choose German X-rays or anti-gonorrhea serum, and electrostatic therapy, and use gonorrhea "Ke Lin Nong" as a necessary internal medicine. In the statistics of our clinical experiments, taking "Ke Lin Nong" for three to five weeks will have the effect of overcoming the Qin Dynasty and fundamentally curing it. In addition to taking "Ke Lin Nong," women with gonorrhea can also externally use "Ka Er Di vaginal tablets" as suppositories to remove vaginal discharge and gonococcus, which can also be radically cured in three weeks. It must be proved that both parties are free of gonorrhea before they can be called completely cured and allowed to cohabit. Diagnosis is from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. From today, 20 numbers will be given out every day, and each number will only cost five corners.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Pulmonary Disease Response Strategies <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Recent scientific advances have led to rapid progress in medicine and pharmacology. Likewise, treatments for pulmonary diseases have made significant strides. The drug "Bu Fei Na Er" (补肺拿尔 - roughly translates to "Lung Nourishing Nall"), for example, was invented as a result of scientific impetus. This formula has proven to be effective in the short term for all stages of pulmonary disease and can gradually shrink cavities in the lungs, eventually returning them to a normal state. Therefore, "Bu Fei Na Er" is considered the premier oral medicine for tuberculosis and pulmonary disease. This is by no means an overstatement. Furthermore, it is also effective for elderly asthma, restless nights, and infantile pertussis (whooping cough). Its ability to nourish the lungs and combat consumption far surpasses that of various cod liver oils. This is generally acknowledged by Chinese and foreign medical professionals, hence its leading position among pulmonary disease medications.</p>

<p>(London) Newspapers continue to report that the British government is preparing to take active measures in the near future to protect British interests in China. The Birmingham Post stated that after Parliament reconvenes, the government will announce steps to safeguard British interests in the Far East. However, credible sources indicate this statement lacks accuracy. The Financial News reported that the British government is carefully considering two approaches: direct assistance to the Chinese government in the form of monetary loans, and implementing a plan that would have a more direct impact on Japan's commerce and finance than on China's resistance efforts. However, the government is reluctant to impose general restrictions on Japanese imports into Britain. According to Reuters, part of the difficulty the British government faces in commercial retaliation is opposition from metal and wool textile industries in the self-governing dominions that trade with Japan. It is reported that Washington is also being hindered by the oil, cotton waste, iron scrap and machinery industries. However, one thing is undoubtedly certain: the British government's attitude is becoming increasingly firm, and there is a growing sense that mere diplomatic protests will be fruitless. Britain's assistance to China is legally unassailable. It is believed that the British government will first send Japan a detailed note similar to the one issued by the United States on December 31 as a final effort to persuade Japan to respect British rights and interests before implementing more stringent plans to directly protect British interests in the Far East.

<p>Washington: The Foreign Affairs Committees of both the Senate and House of Representatives are scheduled to meet within days to discuss economic sanctions and amendments to the Neutrality Act. Regarding the former, some members of Congress now advocate using economic sanctions against Japan. Democratic Senator Pittman (Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) stated, "If one can force someone to respect your rights through starvation, why necessarily execute them?" Republican Senator Borah (former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee) expressed opposition, stating, "Economic sanctions are by no means a peaceful measure, but a preliminary step to war. If I am not prepared to fight, I should not implement sanctions." It remains to be seen which faction will prevail when the Foreign Affairs Committees of both houses begin their discussions.

<p>(Nanjing) The Guomin News reported this morning that Foreign Minister Arita will ask U.S. Ambassador Grew to visit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a discussion before departing for home, in order to reiterate Japan's policy toward China. He will use this opportunity to point out the unfortunate situation that continued U.S. assistance to the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek will cause, and the possibility that this will lead Japan to reconsider its promise to respect U.S. rights in China. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today responded to a question from a foreign reporter on this matter, saying that he had not heard of the news reported in the Guomin News, but that it was quite possible that Ambassador Grew would visit Foreign Minister Arita before departing for home.

<h3 id="e36">Is a World War Inevitable This Spring? U.S. Ambassadors to Britain and France Submit Confidential Reports Advocating That the United States Must Step Up Preparations. <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Armed Services Committees of both the Senate and House of Representatives held a closed joint session yesterday. According to a member present, Ambassador Kennedy to Britain reported on the European situation, stating that "a world war may occur this spring." Ambassador Bullitt to France also reported at the meeting and agreed with Kennedy. Kennedy also predicted that the war would break out due to German aggression in Ukraine or Italian attempts to seize Tunisia. Kennedy also submitted to the committee information on the strength of the German air force, compiled by Colonel Lindbergh. It stated that Germany currently has 10,000 first-line aircraft and can produce 1,200 new aircraft per month. Kennedy continued, saying that all of this is enough to provide a lesson in "preparation." According to congressmen who attended, Kennedy and Bullitt presented a step-by-step account of European affairs from the Munich Conference to the previous month, detailing the trends in European affairs. Their words were very moving and presented a truly somber atmosphere for peace. Another committee member stated that the two ambassadors' remarks covered some aspects of British and French foreign policy and some opportunities for "appeasing" Mussolini and Hitler. The two ambassadors seemed to have little hope for the future of Europe. The two diplomats spoke for about two hours. According to reliable sources, they did not make any recommendations to increase U.S. national defense, but only reported in detail the current state of complete chaos in Europe. Democratic Senator Reynolds, who attended the meeting, reportedly plans to deliver a speech in the Senate within days, exposing everything said in yesterday's closed meeting. Upon hearing this, the others were shocked. It appears that his colleagues will advise him not to do so. Committee members stated that they had briefly discussed Colonel Lindbergh's report on the strength of the German air force. The U.S. government was fortunate to receive this report, but much of what was said had already been known to military observers. Lindbergh merely confirmed it. As the members of the two committees left the meeting, they all wore expressions of concern. One member said, "The British Empire and France are currently facing an extremely serious crisis." If this meeting has indeed served the purpose anticipated by most people, which is to facilitate President Roosevelt's grand arms program, it seems to have been particularly effective. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Some committee members said that the ambassadors stated that Germany currently has 1,000 first-line aircraft and can build an average of 200 per month. Ambassador Kennedy also presented and read a report prepared by the famous American aviator Colonel Lindbergh on the strength of the German air force. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Armed Services Committees of both the Senate and House of Representatives held a secret joint meeting today, listening to reports from Ambassador Kennedy to Britain and Ambassador Bullitt to France on the European situation, especially on the military preparations of European countries, in order to decide on the U.S. defense plan. It is uncommon for ambassadors to report to the Armed Services Committees. The meeting lasted for two hours, and all committee members were present to listen attentively. According to well-informed sources, the ambassadors stated that the European situation has become tense due to the attitudes of German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. Political figures said that the ambassadors were supporting the defense message that President Roosevelt was about to present. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(New York) According to the results of a survey conducted by the American Institute of Public Opinion, the American people generally agree with President Roosevelt's criticism of the actions of the dictatorships. At the same time, the number of Americans dissatisfied with Germany is increasing daily. Before Germany annexed Austria, most people were neutral towards Hitler, believing that the United States should not interfere in European disputes, accounting for 62 percent of the total. After the German-Austrian union, the number of Americans who believed that the United States would eventually fight Germany accounted for 46 percent of the total. Later, after the Czech problem was resolved, Hitler issued a statement saying, "Germany no longer has territorial ambitions in Europe." At that time, 92 percent of Americans did not want to believe it. Until recently, the Institute of Public Opinion again surveyed public opinion on the issue of boycotting German goods, and the results showed that 61 percent voted in favor. The increasing anti-German sentiment among Americans is evident from this. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Rome) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax arrived here at 4:25 p.m. today. Prime Minister Mussolini arrived at the station at 4:15 p.m. to greet them. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Although the reception for British Prime Minister Chamberlain and others is not as extravagant as the reception for German leader Hitler, there is a genuine atmosphere of friendship and enthusiasm. Officials have not yet commented on the events to be discussed by both sides. However, according to local sources, although reports from London suggest that the talks will be of a general nature, they will ultimately have to address specific issues such as Franco-Italian relations, the Spanish problem, Italian colonial aspirations, the administration of the Suez Canal, the resolution of the Jewish question, and Anglo-Italian commercial relations. These are all issues that will be discussed by both sides. The first formal welcome to the British delegation will take place in Turin this morning at 8:00 a.m. The special train carrying the British delegation is expected to arrive in Genoa at around 10:00 a.m., where they will be welcomed by Italian military and civilian authorities. At 4:20 p.m. in the afternoon, the British delegation will arrive in Rome, where Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and other Italian cabinet members and British embassy staff will gather at the station to greet them. Rome Station is decorated with flowers and national flags. The British representatives will ride in seven cars along the streets lined with soldiers to the Madama Hotel, designated by the Italian government to accommodate the guests. The first car will be occupied by the British Prime Minister and the Italian Foreign Minister. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax arrived here last night by special train. The station was adorned with the flags of both countries and covered with red carpets. French Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, British Ambassador Phipps, and British Embassy staff were all at the station to greet them. As the British delegation traveled by car to the French Foreign Ministry, the crowds welcomed them and waved their handkerchiefs in salute. After arriving at the Foreign Ministry, the British delegation had refreshments and then began political talks. In addition to Chamberlain and Halifax, the British side included British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan and Ingram, as well as Ambassador to France Phipps. The French side included Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry Léger, Chief Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Rochat, and Ministry member Bréart. It is believed that the French cabinet members first presented their views on Italian demands during the talks, and the British cabinet members expressed their complete agreement. What they wanted to say in Rome was conveyed to the French cabinet members, who had no objections. According to political sources here, the visit of the British cabinet members to Rome is not intended to issue any special declarations, but only to hear Italy's views, as Italy's views have always been kept secret. However, if Italy seeks Britain's opinion, Chamberlain and Halifax will offer beneficial steps to Italy: first, to ease the situation in the Mediterranean, Italy should completely withdraw its troops from Spain; second, if Italy wants to resolve matters directly with France, it can contact France directly and cancel its newspaper propaganda and clamor. If so, Italy may be able to turn Djibouti, the capital of French Somaliland, into a free port. Political circles now believe that the principle of the Rome talks is that nothing is gained without something given. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax arrived at the Gare du Nord station in this capital this afternoon. Prime Minister Daladier, Foreign Minister Bonnet, and many other French dignitaries welcomed them at the station. The British and French cabinet members then drove to the Foreign Ministry amidst the cheers of the crowd to attend a tea party and conduct talks, which lasted for one hour and ten minutes. Afterwards, according to an official press release, British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, en route to Italy, met with Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris. They exchanged views and fully confirmed that their opinions were in agreement. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At yesterday's cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Bonnet announced that he had recently sent a note, with precise and complete wording, stating France's views on Italian demands, to the British Ambassador for transmission to the British government. After Bonnet read this note, the cabinet members unanimously approved the clear and firm position taken by France. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax are scheduled to arrive here this afternoon. All newspapers have published this news on their front pages and issued editorials expressing their welcome, stating that Prime Minister Chamberlain is a contributor to promoting friendship between Britain and Italy. The Rome People's News reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain and Prime Minister Mussolini are very close friends, and once said that "a policy of action is truly a madness in the heat of summer. What he did last September not only met human expectations, but also recently put the Anglo-Italian agreement into practice. His prestige in Italy is above that of all foreign politicians, and it is appropriate. The Envoy's News reported that we are entering a historical era, and there are urgent tasks that cannot be delayed. We must move forward with a decisive resolution and a thorough approach. It is well known that his actions are also very open and aboveboard. As the British cabinet members come to visit, we will put aside the specific issues for now and sincerely welcome them." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) As the British and Italian cabinet members are about to hold talks, the semi-official Italian Daily recently explained Italy's wishes, stating that the evolution of bilateral relations will depend on how the Spanish issue is resolved. "Italy has honestly stated its position on this matter and will certainly bring this issue to a fair and equitable conclusion." In addition, the British and Italian cabinet members should also discuss general European issues. "The various demands recently made by Italy do not threaten the interests of Britain and other countries in Europe or elsewhere, and are necessary for the peaceful order of Europe. Italy will certainly assert its claims resolutely in due course, in an appropriate manner, and with a sense of national dignity, but will not resort to fruitless expressions. Prime Minister Chamberlain must understand this. It is hoped that after the talks between Britain and Italy, both Franco-Italian relations and major European issues can be determined and an understanding can be established with a realistic spirit, thereby promoting positive cooperation. Once the legitimate needs of Germany and Italy have been met, the German-Italian axis will contribute to European peace." (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph's Warsaw correspondent reports that Polish Foreign Minister Beck, during his talks in Berchtesgaden and Munich last week, obtained assurances from Hitler that his Eastern European plans are not directly hostile to Poland. This means that Germany and Poland will not be hostile to each other in the short term. Unless British Prime Minister Chamberlain's trip to Rome causes a sudden change in his current views, Hitler's intention seems to be to extend Germany's political and economic influence to the Soviet border, but without crossing Polish territory. The northern countries of Latvia and Estonia and the southern country of Romania all have points of contact with the Soviet Union, so there is no need to touch Polish territory. The road to Bessarabia also passes through Carpathian Ukraine and Ruthenia in eastern Czechoslovakia. During the Berchtesgaden meeting, Germany seemed to believe that its Eastern European plan, after obtaining Poland's goodwill, could be realized through strong diplomatic action and with the full support of the German propaganda machine.

<p>(Moscow) Commercial negotiations between Poland and the Soviet Union, which began in December of last year, have now been completed and a formal trade agreement will be signed here around the 19th of this month. Li Chonoski, Director of the Trade Agreement Department of the Polish Ministry of Commerce, is scheduled to lead a delegation to this country in the near future to sign the agreement with Soviet representatives, namely, Mikoian, Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Trade. According to this trade agreement, the Soviet Union will purchase 70,000,000 to 80,000,000 złoty worth of goods from Poland each year, with textiles accounting for 25 percent. The two sides also plan to negotiate a transit agreement for goods. This trade agreement was originally scheduled to be signed in Warsaw, but it has now been changed to Moscow. The reason for this change is said to be that Poland feared that the Soviet Union sending high-ranking officials to Warsaw would provoke an excessive reaction from Germany, so it advocated signing the agreement in Moscow. Poland is willing to continue to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and wants to maintain a balance between Germany and the Soviet Union. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) Before U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson departed on the French ship Île de France today, he met with a Reuters reporter and spoke about the Burma Road, saying that it only took 12 days for a car to travel from Chongqing to Burma. The road surface is quite good and level, and the road is wide enough for two cars to drive side by side. The width is currently being expanded. Initially, part of the road was washed away by heavy rain, but it was later rebuilt, and the project was more solid than before. The original wooden bridges have been replaced with stone bridges. As far as he could see, this road could be used by any heavy-duty vehicle. The road construction employed a total of 150,000 people, using oxen to pull stone rollers to flatten the road surface. There are now hotels with European-style facilities along the road, and warning signs are erected at every bend in the road or where attention is needed. Johnson arrived in Marseille from Rangoon on a British flying boat, saying that the trip was extremely comfortable.

Professor Afranio do Amaral of Rio de Janeiro (an Argentinian) declared that Germany, Italy, and Japan are currently conducting military preparations in North and South America. He presented documents proving the activities of National Socialists and Fascists in Brazil, Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, Chile, Guatemala, Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and several other countries. He also stated that Argentina now has terrorist organizations, and that a "German naval base" is located at the port of Malabrigo on the coast of Peru. The border of this concession area is guarded by National Socialist sentries. The professor also accused German and Italian diplomats of attempting to control the Argentine education system, stating that students in German colonies are now wearing National Socialist uniforms and wearing swastika badges. Similar situations exist in Uruguay and Chile. He knows that Italy has transported artillery and machine guns into Peruvian territory near the Ecuadorian border. The National Socialists control Colombia's airlines, which is the largest airline group in South America.

If all current applicants are approved, it would take eleven years to process them. Since 1929, the number of Germans entering the US each year has been lower than the quota. 1938 was the first year in many years that the quota was filled.

<p>Zaragoza Yesterday, after occupying Térmens, the Nationalist forces achieved a significant success in the attack on Catalonia. The troops commanded by General Moscardó continued to advance along the Lleida-Térmens road this morning, and have now occupied two villages. At the same time, the troops under General Valeriano, operating in the north, are also advancing along the Cervera-Térmens road. As a result, the important bases of the government forces' defense line on the northwest sides are under pressure from the Nationalist forces. The troops attacking in the north, after a slight resistance, occupied the Térmens airfield and a village, and soon made contact with the troops advancing from the west, encircling the city of Térmens. Térmens is of great military importance, as it is a hub for traffic between Lleida and Barcelona, and between Montblanc and Cervera. In the southern part of the Catalonia front, the Navarre troops are attacking and have occupied the Sierra de la Llena, cutting off the northern connection of Térmens. The government forces now have only one lifeline left, which is the one leading to Tarragona. Nationalist artillery fire has been continuously directed at the city since yesterday morning.

Members of Parliament have recently stated that a political crisis within the cabinet due to air defense organizational issues is not out of the question. It is rumored that Anderson once submitted his resignation, but Prime Minister Chamberlain persuaded him to wait until the Prime Minister returns from Rome before making a decision. The reason for this is that there is no specialized department for air defense matters. Anderson has been given extensive powers to organize air defense without being subject to the constraints of the five ministries: Home Affairs, Health, Education, Labor, and Finance. Ministers of these departments are not obligated to follow Anderson's orders, making it difficult to implement them quickly. This is the reason for their passive attitude. Furthermore, Anderson assumed an important position upon entering politics. Certain cabinet members who aspire to be Prime Minister view him as a strong competitor and harbor feelings of jealousy. This is another reason for Anderson's unease in his position. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>(Singapore) The famous Krakatoa volcano in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra has erupted again. It has erupted nearly 200 times in recent weeks, with flames reaching up to 1,000 feet. Krakatoa volcano erupts frequently. During the eruption in 1883, Banda, 1,050 miles away, was plunged into darkness at noon. Volcanic ash formed a belt, circling the Earth from Scandinavia to the Cape of Good Hope. The vibrations from the eruption were felt 3,000 miles away in Rodrigues and Australia, and triggered giant tidal waves up to 50 feet high, resulting in the deaths of over 36,000 people.

<h3 id="e52">Eden Praises Roosevelt's Policies: Calls His Message a Historical Masterpiece <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden recently delivered a speech at a banquet of the American Chamber of Commerce, praising President Roosevelt's policies. He said, "President Roosevelt's message to Congress yesterday was clear and straightforward, a true masterpiece that will become a historical document. Its importance goes beyond that. In essence, President Roosevelt has pointed out the correct path for all freedom-loving countries in the world, and it has had a very positive impact on the British people. I believe that you all agree with this. However, agreement between Britain and the United States is not enough. We must both believe in the same principles. President Roosevelt's message, both in its wording, which accurately represents the views of the majority of the American people, and in its sentiments, which align with the feelings of the majority of the British people, is something we all recognize and does not need further explanation." At this point, Eden criticized dictatorship, saying, "The most peculiar and terrifying thing after the European war is the new trend of worshiping national idols in Europe. Certain peoples have been infected by it and regard it as a crusade. This is unacceptable to the public in theory, whether in the United States or in Britain. The people of both countries should resist it based on the concepts of rights, nation, and individual freedom. We are not just talking about avoiding infection; democratic countries in Western Europe must also take action to demonstrate that nations founded on our social values are not only capable of organizing themselves but can also become strong. Today, the power of certain countries is very strong. If we continue to use outdated methods to counter them, it would be blind and foolish. The consequences would be unthinkable. If the needs of the nation are hampered or ignored, everything, including individual freedom, will be lost. I am convinced that the British people are increasingly aware of this fundamental problem and are becoming more determined to solve it." (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Wang Jingwei's Whereabouts a Mystery: Rumored Still in Hanoi, Annam <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since Wang Jingwei issued his infamous telegram, there have been numerous rumors about his whereabouts. Chen Gongbo arrived in Hong Kong by plane from Hanoi the day before the infamous telegram was issued, and said that Wang had already taken a boat from Hanoi to Hong Kong. However, after the infamous telegram was issued, it was suddenly rumored that Wang had crossed the border into Hong Kong and gone to Shanghai, while others said Wang had not come to Hong Kong at all and was still recuperating in Hanoi. His actual location is elusive. According to sources, Chen Gongbo is currently residing in a building on a road in Kowloon Tong, Kowloon. Few people other than those wearing uniforms have been seen entering and leaving this building in recent days. It is impossible to confirm whether Wang is also living inside. According to another source, Wang is currently residing in a French private hospital and has no intention of going to Shanghai. The Hong Kong authorities cannot be responsible for his personal safety, so Wang's movements are extremely secret. He does not receive anyone except for two or three close confidants. Still another source says that Wang has not come to Hong Kong and is still in a hospital in Hanoi. The infamous telegram was issued through representatives in Hong Kong. However, according to more reliable news, Wang seems to still be in Hanoi. There are probably two main reasons for Wang Jingwei's issuance of the infamous telegram: first, some bureaucrats who have been living comfortably all along, although they have not suffered the displacement and family destruction of the refugees since the start of the war of resistance, they cannot enjoy themselves to the fullest as they could in Nanjing. As a result, they have gradually become tired of the war of resistance, which is aimed at the survival of the nation, and have the intention of seeking peace through national betrayal. However, none of them dare to openly advocate this. After a long period of brewing, Wang finally disregarded everything and issued this telegram, because Wang believed that the telegram, once issued, would be widely echoed. Second, since the start of the war of resistance, the foundation of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has become increasingly solid. Some old bureaucrats in the Kuomintang do not take the interests of the entire country as a prerequisite, but haggle over the gains and losses of personal power. They deeply feel that if the war of resistance continues, the left-leaning forces will gradually increase, which will greatly hinder their personal interests, so they gradually developed the idea of seeking peace, hoping to surrender to the outside world in order to consolidate their rule at home. Unexpectedly, once the infamous telegram was issued, people in all regions rose up in opposition. Some figures who originally agreed with Wang's advocacy of peace did not dare to speak out on this issue. Furthermore, Lin Bosheng and Mei Siping were the agents in Hong Kong who handled the issuance of the infamous telegram. Lin had been with Wang for many years. After Shanghai fell last year, Lin came to Hong Kong to serve as Wang's representative, while also holding an important position in the Central Propaganda Department to carry out activities. Mei was not originally a member of Wang's circle, and only became involved with Wang's faction not long ago. When the infamous telegram was issued, Lin and Mei were jointly responsible for signing the document, but Mei seems to be very upset recently.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Kunshan Guerrilla Forces Actually Share Profits with Puppet Checkpoints: Bandits and Traitors Coexist in Surprising Harmony; Where Is the Mission of Resistance and National Salvation? <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: After the puppet county government appeared in Kunshan, it immediately set up checkpoints everywhere to exploit the people. There are about thirty checkpoints in the entire county, and the monthly income is very large. In addition to the six gates in the urban area, puppet checkpoints have been set up in all the important locations in various villages and towns to carry out extortion. Among them, the puppet checkpoint at the Longwang Temple in Lujiaqiao is the key transportation hub connecting Shanghai, Changshu, Suzhou, Kunshan, and Taicang. Merchants from the interior who go to Shanghai to purchase goods cannot escape this checkpoint, so its income is the highest among all the checkpoints. Puppet officials generally regarded the Longwang Temple checkpoint as a lucrative position. Last month, Chen Wenlong, through the introduction of a certain person, became the puppet tax director of the Longwang Temple. However, there is a very active guerrilla force stationed in the area. At first, the guerrilla force repeatedly ordered the puppet government to stop setting up checkpoints, but the puppet county government refused to give up this area, which was the most profitable area for raising money. After multiple attempts, they negotiated with the guerrilla force, and as a result, the puppet checkpoint handed over half of the monthly revenue to the guerrilla force, to share the spoils. As a result, they lived in peace with each other. Unexpectedly, Chen Wenlong was blinded by greed and did not distribute a portion of the money that should have been given to the guerrilla force last month, but pocketed it for himself. The guerrilla force immediately demanded an explanation from the puppet county magistrate and declared that they would send troops into Kunshan within the shortest possible time. After receiving the report, the puppet magistrate ordered Pan Chen, the head of the puppet police station, to send police to arrest Chen, but Chen had already received the news and fled to another place, escaping arrest. Later, through the efforts of a certain person, he was willing to hand over the original money, and the puppet magistrate approved his request, promising not to pursue the matter in the past, and the matter was settled.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Guangdong Province Completes Southern Defense: Guangdong-Guangxi Armies Are Assigned to High, Lei, Qin, and Lian Respectively; Cai Tingkai's Troops Are Prepared to Assist in Liangyang <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in the east and west of Guangdong Province is currently in a stalemate. In the eastern district, from the suburbs of Guangzhou to Zengcheng and Conghua, the mountains are stacked upon each other, and the important roads are all held by the Chinese army. The Japanese army also knows that it is difficult to advance and cannot penetrate deeply. In the western district, the Chinese army has stationed large numbers of troops above Zhaoqing, and Japanese warships cannot easily cross the Zhaoqing Gorge. Therefore, the Japanese army at the Sanshui River Estuary is only increasing its fortifications, and although it has six or seven thousand men, it is not easy to drive westward for a long distance. Moreover, there are tens of thousands of Cai Tingkai's troops on the south bank, and if the Japanese army goes deep, its rear will be in danger of being encircled. The Japanese army also knows that a rash advance will be dangerous, so it first occupied Jiujiang, which belongs to Nanhai, to prevent the southwest Chinese army from flanking it. This is the reason why there is no fierce fighting in the West River recently. Since the Japanese army abandoned the Eastern and Western Rivers, the Chinese army took the opportunity to focus on the coastal areas of the southern region. As the southern region is the vanguard of Guangxi Province, the elite of the Guangxi army has recently arrived to deploy defenses. In general, the Guangxi army focuses on the Qinlian area, the Guangdong army is responsible for the Gaolei area, and Cai Tingkai's troops are deployed in Liangyang to assist the southwest. The Japanese army's attempts to invade the south are based on Weizhou Island, south of Qinlian. The Japanese army on the island has recently built an airfield with a squadron of the Sixth Air Corps. There are six or seven Japanese warships near the island, half of which are responsible for blockading the Hepu coastline, and the rest are cruising off the coast of Qiongya. It was rumored that several Japanese transport ships were transporting troops south, and the southern defense was tense at the same time. Important military officers from Guangxi Province personally went to various places in the southern region to inspect and deploy fortifications. Sixty to seventy thousand troops have been deployed in the area between Qinxian and Hepu, and are also taking care of the Lingshan line to prevent the Japanese army from landing in Hepu and trying to invade Nanning, Guangxi. In addition, large numbers of troops are also deployed in Yongchun, Hengxian, and Nanning on the border of Guangxi. The former line, such as Shawei and Dangwu near Hepu, all have naturally dangerous terrain, and the Japanese attempt to land is not easy. In the Gaolei area, a certain unit of the Guangdong army and the Qiongya defense army support each other, and their strength is also strong.</p>

<p>Qingpu Correspondence: Because the Japanese army stationed in various places in Qingpu felt the activity of the guerrillas, they did not dare to take a step outside their strongholds. Now they have received orders to go to the front line, so they have revealed a great sense of war-weariness. Three Japanese soldiers were found to have committed suicide a few days ago. It is now learned that five more Japanese soldiers have been found to have committed suicide in Zhujiajiao in three consecutive days. However, the Japanese side has secretly concealed the suicide of Japanese soldiers, so the actual number may be more than this. This shows the war-weariness of the Japanese soldiers.</p>

<p>Ningbo Correspondence: The Ningbo Defense Headquarters previously formulated supplementary measures regarding passenger exits under the Temporary Regulations on Navigation in Eastern Zhejiang and submitted them to the Headquarters of the Eighth Army Group for review. The instructions are as follows: (1) Women and men under the age of sixteen or over the age of forty-five who are going to Shanghai or Hong Kong shall comply with the provisions of the latter part of Article 5, Paragraph 1 of the Navigation Regulations. According to the latter part of Article 5, Paragraph 1, those who do not fall within this limit must hold legal documents, identity or a certificate from the local county government or above before they can be released. Civil servants holding legal documents who are going to Shanghai or Hong Kong can be released. (2) When non-residents and civil servants in the area exit, they shall comply with the provisions of Articles 1, 2, and 3 of Article 5, and their certificates shall be issued by their original county government or higher or by the sending agency. (3) Passengers traveling to and from various places in the area, such as Dinghai, Xiangshan, Shipu, and Ninghai, do not need to issue travel permits, and there are no restrictions on goods. However, such passengers and goods can only take small ferry steamships traveling within the area. (4) Passengers and goods traveling to and from the neighboring areas of Wenzhou and Taizhou, shall be examined and processed in accordance with Articles 1, 2, and 3 of Article 5 and Articles 6 and 7 of the Navigation Regulations.</p>
<p>The Ningxian Shipping Association, because the registration of steamships ordered by the Headquarters of the Tenth Army Group will not be allowed to sail until it is approved, has been handled by the Ningbo Defense Department since it took over the port, and they have been registered in accordance with the regulations. The deadline has passed, and it has been more than twenty days. Although seven ships, including Moufu, Kaibo, Xinxiangtai, Tangsai, Meida, Tianbao, and Libao, have been approved for registration, there are still many that have not been announced. Currently, agricultural products are accumulating along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and the time is right for the end of the old lunar year, and there is an urgent need to convert to finance. There is a lot of goods waiting to be transported, and the supply and demand situation is difficult to adjust. All the ships waiting to be launched are also eager to resume business as soon as possible in order to make a living. Therefore, they specifically telegraphed Commander Liu, asking him to announce the approved ships at the same time as soon as possible, so that agricultural products can be transferred in time, and shipping companies have equal opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The New Fourth Army Focuses on Work Among the People; Farmers Express Their Love and Respect for the New Fourth Army <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Continuation of a Dispatch from Belden, Special Correspondent for the English-Language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, from the Headquarters of the New Fourth Army South of Wuhu. The previous article discussed the New Fourth Army's methods of working among the people. This information was obtained from both the army and the people. On the surface, it seemed like propaganda, so I decided to personally investigate the relationship between the army and the people. One day, I spoke with Tang Shihui (transliteration), Deputy Minister of the Political Department, and summoned a farmer to ask, "What do you think of the New Fourth Army?" He replied, "They are excellent because they always pay for what they buy, don't steal chickens, don't force us to work, and don't yell at us or curse us." But this was still not the best evidence. The old farmer might have been saying this because he saw the military officer and me together. That evening, I went to a small store to buy cigarettes. The young shopkeeper invited me to sit down for a cup of tea and we talked about the war. The young man said, "We are not afraid. If the Japanese come, we will fight them because we are organized, have guns, and know how to shoot." When I mentioned the New Fourth Army, he said, "They pay for what they buy, are neat and clean, and talk and play with us, so the people all love them. And the other troops also respect and are friendly to the people." One morning, I was walking in the fields and encountered five children, about ten years old, each holding wooden toy guns, running and pretending to shoot enemies. I asked them what they were doing. One of them said, "We are practicing killing Japanese." I said, "Why don't you shoot me?" They laughed and said, "You are Russian." (Last year, a Russian interviewer came here, so they thought anyone who looked similar was Russian.) Then I told them that I was American. They immediately shouted, "Oh, you must love peace and hate fascism!" On the streets of a town near the headquarters, I often saw civilians and soldiers walking arm in arm, talking and laughing. I also saw children climbing on the soldiers' laps and jumping around. Many soldiers were popular with the people. When walking on the street, I often heard them greeting each other, "Comrade, have you had breakfast? Please come and have some tea," and so on. But this was still not enough proof. One day, I was walking in the fields with [Agnes] Smedley when a farmer came out of his house and invited us in for tea. The neighbors all gathered. According to them, the land here was owned by two large landlords and several small landlords. Each mu (unit of land) was taxed sixty jin (unit of weight) of rice or wheat per year. The farmers in the area were extremely poor. Then a young farmer said, "Before, when the Sichuan army arrived here, they forcibly conscripted laborers to carry things. Later, when the New Fourth Army came here, they told us that the army could not fight without the people. They asked us to help them, and since they were so different from the previous army, we were all willing to help them and organized a farmers' union to cast broadswords and spears and repair old guns. Because we were short of food, we decided to hold a meeting." At this point, the young man took a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to me. It read, "Notice to Farmers from the Anti-Japanese United Association of the Twenty-First Bao (administrative unit). We have decided to hold a meeting on the second day of this month (December). We hope all farmers will participate," and so on. The young man continued, "Before the meeting, we asked the landlords to reduce rent, so the landlords did not participate. But we still held the meeting as scheduled and sent a notice to the landlords, stating that 'People have organized anti-Japanese United Association branches everywhere. This year, there is a poor harvest and the front lines are fiercely engaged in fighting. If you do not welcome the arrival of the Japanese army, then extend our debts by one year, so that the farmers can live this year and take up arms to defend their homeland.' But the landlords did not agree to our request. The chairman of the United Association then told the landlords that the rent should be reduced by 20 percent. The landlords had no choice but to agree to reduce the rent. Now we only pay 40 to 45 jin of rent." Now the farmers only have one fear: that the rent will be raised again after the New Fourth Army has to leave. Many farmers have joined the New Fourth Army to fight on the front lines. The New Fourth Army is an army of the people. The people all say, "We help the army, and the army protects us and works with us. This is the right way." I believe this.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Yangzhou states that the Japanese army previously planned to forcibly conscript young men from Yangzhou to send to the front lines to fight, but when the young men in the city heard this news, they fled in droves. Later, the traitors Wu Xiaohou and others offered a suggestion to change the conscription to recruitment and established a fake "Police and Security School," falsely claiming that it was training puppet police officers to "pacify" and protect the local area. They claimed that after six months of training and passing the exam, they would be appointed as military officers and would not be subject to the Japanese side's orders or transfers. For a time, more than 600 unemployed young men from various towns in Yangzhou, driven by livelihood and confused, went to register. Wu Xiaohou has now taken the position of puppet principal and has begun active training. Once the training is complete, they will be sent to various battlefields by the Japanese side to serve as cannon fodder and implement their poisonous policy of "using Chinese to control Chinese." The traitors are unscrupulous and harming young people, which is extremely painful.</p>

<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>Although public debt trading has been transformed into black market dealings, the so-called "Public Concessions" operated by foreign merchants have always been openly sucking up domestic capital. Since the start of the war, the amount of domestic capital flowing out of the country through this channel has been enormous. The following table shows this:</p>
<p>Number of Shares Traded in Public Concessions Securities from January to December 16 of the Past Year</p>
<p>Type Number of Shares Traded in 1937 Number of Shares Traded in 1938</p>
<p>(Note) Source: North China Daily News Dec. 17, 1938.</p>
<p>All kinds of stocks and bonds listed in that place were issued by foreign merchants. The number of transactions of various securities this year has almost increased sharply compared with the past. The amount of absorbed domestic capital must be very large. Recalling the countries during the European war, they only obtained capital from overseas and recovered domestic securities investments abroad, but our country is the opposite. It is lamentable!</p>
<p>Shanghai fell in the winter of last year, so each bank only handled closing of accounts but did not handle liquidation. This year, most banks have successively made supplementary liquidation and announced the balance sheet of assets and liabilities. Now, the important items of assets and liabilities of 23 member banks, including Bank of China, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Bank of Communications, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, China Land Reclamation Bank, Overseas Chinese Commercial Bank, Sichuan Meifeng Bank, Juxingsheng Bank, East Asia Bank, Chung Foo Union Bank, Kuo Hua Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Pudong Bank, China National Industries Bank, Zhi Zhong Bank, Tong Ho Bank (ceased operation this year), Yung Ta Commercial Bank, Wing Hang Bank, Chung Ho Bank, Chuankang Bank, China Enterprise Bank, and Zhongnan Bank, are separately counted, and the ratio tables are compared with the previous year as follows (unit: national currency thousand yuan)</p>
<p>Statistical Table of Important Business Items of 23 Member Banks in Shanghai</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 26 Republic of China Year 25 Paid-in Capital 116,430 109,128 Public Reserve 28,880 33,482 Cash 481,620 131,176 Banknotes 222,281 ...... Various Loans 1,167,979 1,496,602 Valuable Securities 234,557 168,388</p>
<p>(Note) This table is compiled and counted by the author according to the balance sheets of assets and loans of each bank. If there is any error, I hope the readers will correct it.</p>
<p>There is one shocking figure in the above table, that is, the decrease of public reserve, which cannot be understood. As for the contraction of loans, the slight decrease of deposits, and the increase of cash and valuable securities, they fully reveal the wartime situation. The net profit has indeed decreased sharply compared with the past, but except for the China Bank, which had a net loss in the 26th year of the Republic of China, the rest all had a slight surplus. And the most remarkable are Overseas Chinese Commercial Bank, East Asia Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Sichuan Meifeng Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Kuo Hua Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank and other banks, which are all above 200,000 yuan. The rest range from more than 100,000 to more than 2,000 yuan. It was once heard that a certain bank, after August 13, never implemented the measures to stabilize the financial situation and restricted depositors from withdrawing money, so it absorbed a lot of money; later, its entry and exit in the foreign exchange black market was also the most powerful. And now it is also in the midst of obtaining huge net profits; it is really hateful!</p>
<p>If the Bank of China, which had a net loss, is not counted, there were a total of 22 companies with net profits in the 26th year of the Republic of China. The paid-in capital was 76,430,000 yuan in total, and the net profit rate was 4.44%. It can be said that it is really good under the circumstances of war and flying bullets. However, looking back at the report of the British HSBC Bank, the net profit last year reached 12,127,542 Hong Kong dollars, and its paid-in capital was only 20,000,000 Hong Kong dollars. Compared with each other, how can it not be shocking? In recent years, why the governments of various countries have been advocating the merger of banks, is this only for the complete sake of the banks themselves?</p>

<h3 id="e62">Fierce Encounter in the Southern Section of Yangjing, Pudong; Intense Machine Gun and Steel Cannon Fire; About 20 Japanese Soldiers Killed or Wounded <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, a fierce encounter between Chinese and Japanese troops occurred again in the southern section of Yangjing, Pudong, near the Nanyangjing Bridge. On the Japanese side, it was a part of the 5th Battalion of the Fuzhai Naval Landing Force. While patrolling the area at night, they were suddenly preemptively ambushed by guerrillas. The two sides first used rifles to bombard each other, followed by intense machine gun fire. Villagers were awakened from their dreams and lay on the ground to avoid stray bullets. According to reports, ten Japanese soldiers were shot dead, and an equal number were wounded. For a time, they could not break through. Later, the battalion headquarters heard the alarm and sent some reinforcements, and dragged out small steel cannons to fire three times in a row to help. To avoid frontal casualties, the Chinese army began to retreat. After suffering losses, the Japanese army waited until dawn to search in various places, but the guerrillas had gone far away, so they returned in a disheveled state.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Strictly Enforcing Opium Prohibition; Gradual Abstinence in Stages; No Licenses Issued to Those Under 45 From This Year On <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>In order to strictly enforce opium prohibition, our government has promulgated implementation measures for licensed opium smokers to gradually abstain from opium in stages. Each province and city is preparing to establish a compulsory labor factory to accommodate opium smokers. Opium smokers under the age of 45 will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from January 1 of this year. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Implementation Measures</p>
<p>Implementation Measures for Licensed Opium Smokers in Each Province and City to Gradually Abstain From Opium in Stages: (1) Those under the age of 45 must abstain from opium before the end of December of the 27th year of the Republic of China and will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from January 1 of the 28th year of the Republic of China; (2) Those under the age of 50 must abstain from opium before the end of June of the 28th year of the Republic of China and will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from July 1 of the 28th year of the Republic of China; (3) Those under the age of 55 must abstain from opium before the end of December of the 28th year of the Republic of China and will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from January 1 of the 29th year of the Republic of China; (4) Those under the age of 60 must abstain from opium before the end of June of the 29th year of the Republic of China and will have their opium abstinence licenses suspended from July 1 of the 29th year of the Republic of China; (5) Those over the age of 60 must abstain from opium before the end of December of the 29th year of the Republic of China and the opium abstinence licenses they hold will be revoked at the same time.</p>

After receiving the orders, the governments of each province and city have all been following the above measures and reporting the number of people abstaining from opium in each stage to the Ministry for record. At the same time, they have received orders from the Ministry of Interior to prepare compulsory labor factories in each province, city, and county to accommodate the work of opium smokers. As for the measures for preparing compulsory labor factories and accommodating opium smokers, and the general rules for the management of opium prohibition matters in each province and city, they have all been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Interior and passed at the 397th meeting.</p>

At the end of this year, the radio station will be moved and permanently established in Belmont, California, USA. The US Federal Radio Commission has designated the call sign for the radio station as W6XBE, with a frequency of 9530.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Forty Japanese Soldiers at the Dangkou Salt Factory Completely Annihilated by Chinese Troops; After Completing Their Mission, They Gracefully Withdraw <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>According to someone from Wuxi, Dangkou Town in Wuxi has become the center of inland river commerce since the war, and the market is extremely prosperous. Merchants and travelers come and go every day. The Japanese side believed that it was very close to the county seat and, for military liaison purposes, dispatched 40 Japanese soldiers to be stationed in the salt factory in the town. Due to economic difficulties, the expenses of this group of Japanese soldiers were provided by the puppet organization in the town from tax revenues and donations from shops. The puppets were extremely obsequious, hiring more than ten Hakka prostitutes to be sent to the factory every night to accompany the Japanese soldiers. However, at 6:30 AM on the 9th of this month, Xiong Jiandong, the commander of the guerrillas in Changshu, Jiading, Taicang, Kunshan, Songjiang, and Shanghai, personally led more than 400 soldiers to surround the town and dispatched more than 80 daredevils to directly attack the salt factory, guarding the front and back doors. Because the walls of the factory were high, they used ladders to climb up and fired simultaneously from a high position with hand grenades and machine guns. At dawn, the Japanese army responded in a panic and could not resist. All 42 Japanese soldiers were completely annihilated by Xiong's troops, and a large number of weapons and ammunition were seized. Later, when the Japanese troops from Wuxi, Changshu, and Suzhou heard the news, they went to rescue along different routes, but the Chinese army, with its mission accomplished, had already gracefully withdrawn.</p>
<h3 id="e67">People Rush to Sponsor Refugees; Encourage the Public to Cherish Paper; Refugees Collect and Sell Waste Paper <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association approved a suggestion from Mr. Jin Zhixuan, stating that a letter was sent previously regarding fundraising through picture donations, which should have been received. Now, another method is considered, which is to cherish paper and collect waste materials to generate profit. It is found that the amount of paper wasted in Shanghai every day is considerable. This paper can be sold for three to four yuan per dan (unit of weight). If the Association makes a public appeal and broadcasts a five-minute report on each radio station every day, and each neighborhood and large building sets up a centralized large basket, which will be collected, sorted, and packaged by the refugees, then each dan of waste paper can support two refugees for a month. This is a cost-free benefit, using old morals to encourage the public, and all sectors should be happy to help. After receiving the information, the Association has forwarded the letter to the Association for review.</p>
<p>Sino-French People Sponsor Refugees</p>
<p>Xu Xiaochu, General Manager of the Sino-French Pharmacy, sent a letter to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, when this Association held the fundraising campaign for all sectors to sponsor refugees, during the first day of broadcasting on the Continental Radio Station of our company, our colleagues jointly sponsored 100 people. The sponsorship fee of 200 yuan for the first month has been paid in advance. Now, a list of donor names is enclosed, and the previously issued general receipt is also returned for your inspection. Please prepare separate receipts according to the list for transfer. In addition to the 100 people raised above, we have now raised funds for another four households, including Jiang Yang Shurong, to sponsor 10 people. Four sponsorship certificates are enclosed, and a donation of 20 yuan is also enclosed. All sponsorship fees for the above 110 people will still be collected and remitted by our company on a monthly basis. Please be informed of the above.</p>
<p>Jiang Yiping Raises More Than 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>In addition to personally sponsoring 50 people per month, Mr. Jiang Yiping also persuaded people from all sectors to participate in sponsorship. The total amount of the subscription money reached 10,764 yuan, including He Dekui (20 people), Yu Danhan (50 people), Xu Guisheng (25 people), Ms. Wang Guoxiang (25 people), Xue Dubi (10 people), Yu Qiuni Xian (10 people), Wu Lushe (10 people), Tao's brothers (10 people), Tang Shizhen (10 people) Xiang Liansun (25 people), Li Yunfu (10 people), Zai Shaohe (10 people), Yu Junfu (10 people), Zheng Sun Wenshu (10 people), Wing On Company (50 people), Tung Chang Garage (30 people), Peiping Hongrentang (10 people), Hua Mei Shipping Company (20 people), Lun Sheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory (10 people), New China Coal Briquette Factory (10 people), China Match Company (8 people), and many other subscribing households with less than 10 people. Most of them are for a period of one year.</p>
<p>Fukang Company Takes a Percentage for Refugee Relief</p>
<p>Mr. Yao Quanrong, the owner of the Fukang Biscuit Company in this city, has created a kind of five-spice pepper salt biscuit, which is sold on the market and is quite popular among the public. Recently, Mr. Yao, in view of the fact that 100,000 refugees in Shanghai are crying out for food, has decided to donate all of the business profit of 3 cents (national currency) per catty (unit of weight) of his products to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association for refugee relief. At present, the Association has sent staff to verify that the company is indeed not operating for profit and that each catty purchased by all sectors can provide a meal for a refugee. It is heard that all major companies in this city are selling it.</p>
<p>Move Birthday Feast Fees to Sponsor Refugees</p>
<p>Zhang Ruizhi and Qinghua, brothers in this city, sent a letter to the Citizens' Fundraising Committee yesterday, stating briefly, "The other day was our mother's 60th birthday, and we originally planned to hold a feast to celebrate for her. However, our mother is kind and frugal and does not want to spend money on birthdays. She is always concerned about the suffering of refugees. Therefore, following our mother's order, in addition to refusing gifts from relatives and friends, we will donate all of the 300 yuan (national currency) prepared for the birthday feast to help the refugees." The money was entrusted to Zhang Renxin yesterday and transferred to the Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group to sponsor 25 refugees for a period of six months.</p>

<p>Since the fall of Shanghai, regarding the application and issuance of passports to go abroad, since the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Shanghai has been abolished, all passports to Europe are forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing for approval and issuance through Hong Kong. As for passports to the United States, the Jianghai Customs and the US Consul General in Shanghai have agreed on a method, and it is possible to pay the visa fee directly to the Jianghai Customs, fill out the form, and have the Customs approve it and forward it to the US Consul General in Shanghai for verification and issuance. Since its implementation, people from all walks of life going to the United States have said that it is convenient. As for passports to Europe, they still need to be applied for from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition, if you are going to Yunnan via Annam, the French Consulate in Shanghai can now also issue passports.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Prices of Japanese Goods Soar; Japanese Nationals Refuse to Buy; Japanese Money Flows to the South of the Suzhou Creek; Buying Japanese Goods Means Losing Out <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that yesterday (the 10th), according to the Japanese-language Continental Daily News, Japanese nationals in Hongkou ignored the "Buy Japanese Goods" campaign held by the authorities previously. This can be evidenced by the large number of Japanese customers in major department stores on Nanjing Road in the last ten days of last year. Japanese money is constantly flowing south of the Suzhou Creek. According to what these people listed, the reason for not following the official appeal is that the shops and markets in Hongkou, even cigarette shops and small shops, have raised prices and illegally profited, and the prices are also uneven. The newspaper also quoted a Japanese customer as saying that the personal economic situation made it impossible for him not to buy items in the two concessions, because buying Japanese goods meant losing out. Taking the price of cigarettes as an example, ordinary cigarettes are sold for 75 cents in Japanese clubs, but only 7 jiao (unit of currency, equivalent to 1/10 of a yuan) 8 fen (unit of currency, equivalent to 1/100 of a yuan) across the Suzhou Creek, while in Hongkou shops, the price ranges from 90 sen (unit of Japanese currency, equivalent to 1/100 of a yen) to 1 yuan. And all items have a phenomenon of rising prices. According to a shop owner's explanation, the reason why prices in Hongkou are high and uneven is that Japan has price regulations, and Japanese goods are of "superior quality," and because shops in Hongkou only accept Japanese currency, Japanese nationals spend their money across the Suzhou Creek from Hongkou. The newspaper concluded by saying that the only solution to the conflict of interest between Japanese customers and merchants is to set a formal price standard.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Du Yuesheng and Others Establish Industries: Paper Mill Set Up in Kunming, Capital of 1.4 Million, Factory Name "Dianfeng," Expected Daily Paper Output of Five Tons After Formal Commencement <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Industrialist Du Yuesheng, financier Qian Xinzhi, and the two Wangs from this city, since leaving Shanghai for the south, have devoted themselves to developing industries in the southwest, and have been quite active. In order to recoup losses, they have specifically joined forces with the Minfeng Paper Company of this city to establish the Dianfeng Paper Mill in Kunming, with a fixed capital of 1.4 million yuan. Construction is nearing completion, and formal commencement of operations is expected soon, with a projected daily output of five tons of newsprint to meet various needs. A reporter from Modern News Agency has obtained the following information from the Minfeng Company of this city:</p>
<p>Setting Up a Paper Mill: Recouping Losses</p>
<p>Mr. Du Yuesheng was originally a director of the Minfeng Paper Mill in this city and also chairman of the Huafeng Company in Hangzhou. Since the National Army's westward retreat, and Mr. Du's departure from Shanghai for the south, he has been in Hong Kong with Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, and others, pursuing plans to develop industries in the southwest. Mr. Du also noted that the Huafeng Mill and others had fallen into war zones and could not operate. In order to recoup losses, he planned to establish the Dianfeng Paper Mill in Kunming, with a planned capital of 1.4 million yuan, half to be borne by Shanghai and half by Hong Kong. The Shanghai Minfeng Paper Company also dispatched specialists Zhu Peinong and Chu Fengzhang to Hong Kong last year to discuss progress with Mr. Du and others. They also traveled to Yunnan last November to survey factory sites, consulting with Zhang Xilin, Director of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Construction, who promised to provide full assistance. The equipment for the factory has already been purchased from Germany and will soon be shipped to Yunnan. Once installation is complete, formal commencement of operations should be possible.</p>
<p>Paper Raw Materials: No Worry of Shortage</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Zhu Peinong, specialist from Minfeng Paper Company, Yunnan province has abundant forests and thus abundant paper raw materials. The factory has already decided to use white poplar and pine trees from counties near Kunming as raw materials. Initially, it will purchase from Yiliang, Chenggong, and other places. Later, it plans to establish a forest farm near Haikou for self-cultivation, which should reduce costs and make procurement more convenient.</p>
<p>Projected Daily Paper Production of Five Tons</p>
<p>After the factory commences operations, it plans to specialize in the production of newsprint. Based on the output capacity of the equipment purchased from Germany, it is projected to produce five tons of paper per day. Two and a half tons will be supplied to various newspapers and publications in Kunming, and the remaining two and a half tons will be sold in Guiyang and other neighboring counties. Moreover, the government, to encourage domestic production, has agreed to exempt the factory's products from sales tax, so future prices should be lower than imported goods. If sales gradually increase, the output will be increased to seven tons per day.</p>

<p>Following the implementation of monopoly systems by various provinces and cities to raise funds for the war of resistance, the Zhejiang Provincial Government announced the implementation of a match monopoly. The proclamation is recorded below: The Zhejiang Province Wartime Match Monopoly Regulations, Article 21, states: "Merchants and vendors selling matches within Zhejiang Province who sell whole packages of matches without the monopoly certificate, or matches not approved for sale by the provincial match monopoly authority, will have the matches confiscated and be subject to a fine of one-half to ten times the retail price. Repeat offenders may have their business suspended." Article 27 states: "After the promulgation of these regulations, all matches held by match factories within Zhejiang Province must be sealed. Those holding whole packages of matches must register with the registration authority designated by the provincial monopoly authority within twenty days after the implementation of these regulations, affixing a registration fee of thirty-six yuan per case. Matches affixed with a registration certificate have the same effect as matches affixed with a monopoly certificate." The match monopoly has been implemented on January 1 of this year and has already been announced. All match merchants and vendors are required to comply, and should not misjudge the situation. This proclamation is hereby issued.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Seaport Quarantine After the Quarantine Station is Abolished: Customs Port Affairs Section Takes Over, Only One Quarantine Launch Remaining <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Seaport Quarantine Station automatically closed down after the National Army withdrew from Shanghai the year before last, leading to a temporary suspension of quarantine work in Shanghai port. Subsequently, the Port Affairs Section of the Jianghai Customs took over, and the health of maritime travelers began to be protected. However, although the Jianghai Customs took over the quarantine work, the necessary quarantine equipment was quite inadequate. For example, the Wusong Quarantine Hospital was destroyed, and the quarantine launches were seized and not returned. Therefore, there were many inconveniences in carrying out the work. It is reported that the Shanghai Quarantine Station had more than ten quarantine launches, including "Zhong Jing," "Cai E," "Mulan," and "Yue Fei." Currently, only the "Zhong Jing" remains, and it was salvaged from the Huangpu River by the Customs (because it had been sunk near Lujiazui) and could only be used after repairs.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Adjust Wartime Transportation: Establish Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee, Trade Commission Controls Export of Major Local Products, Merchants Exporting Goods Must Register with the Committee <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>After fully adjusting international trade, the Trade Commission has imposed controls on major local products such as tung oil, silk, and tea. A Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee has been established to handle transportation. Merchants exporting goods must entrust the committee to handle the matter. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee</p>
<p>In order to adjust water and land transportation of goods during the extraordinary period and improve efficiency, the Ministry of Communications, with the approval of the Executive Yuan, has established a Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee to coordinate transportation improvements. It has appointed Song Zi-liang, Lu Zuofu, Qin Fen, Xu Kan, Yu Dawei, Wang Jingsi, Huang Bingheng, Zou Bingwen, and Duanmu Kai as members of the Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee, with Song Zi-liang as chairman and Lu Zuofu as vice-chairman. The general office is located in Chongqing, and branches or offices are established in various provinces to manage water and land transportation matters.</p>
<p>Trade Commission Controls Exports</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance allocated 20 million yuan as a fund, the Trade Commission has been making every effort to adjust international trade, promote increased production and export of local products. Local products subject to foreign exchange settlement are exempt from transit and export taxes, and the Central Trust Bureau underwrites wartime marine insurance. Those certified for export by the commission are allowed to keep the insurance premiums on account, and if the goods are sold at a loss, the insurance premiums are waived. It has now been decided to control the transportation and sale of major local products, and to set prices at the production areas and distribution markets, purchasing as much as possible with available funds. Major local products include tung oil, silk, tea, bristles, leather, mineral sand, and medicinal materials.</p>
<p>Procedures for Entrusting the Export of Goods</p>
<p>Merchants exporting goods must apply for registration with the Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee of the Ministry of Communications. However, when entrusting the committee to transport goods, they must submit a "Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate," a "Customs Declaration," and other documents. After verification, registration is approved, and the "Goods Consignment Note" is stamped with the seal of the Joint Water and Land Transportation Committee. After the exporter receives a notification from the committee to dispatch the vehicle, he should contact the transportation agency for loading. However, the addressee on the bill of lading or cargo ticket should be the Bank of China or Bank of Communications that issued the Foreign Exchange Purchase Certificate.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Regulations for Loading Cargo on Shanghai-Ningbo Ships Stipulated: Freight Rates to be Reduced, Zhongyi Steamship Company Takes the Lead, Further Requesting Authorities' Approval for Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Route <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Although the principle of allowing direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has been approved with detailed regulations, it awaits the study of the Ningbo County Government and Party Headquarters, together with the Chamber of Commerce. Currently, the Ente of the Zhongyi Company, the New Annetta of the American Weili Han Company, the Mufulu of the German Lihe Company, the Cape of the Ningshao Company (agent for a British ship), and the Xinxiangtai of the Huimin Company (agent for a British ship) have all been approved by the General Headquarters of the Tenth Army Group to operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo line. However, before the direct route is confirmed, direct shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is temporarily prohibited, and ships must detour through Taizhou and Wenzhou before entering Ningbo, primarily for loading cargo. (1) Mufulu specializes in loading silk cocoons. (2) Cape specializes in loading cotton. (3) Xinxiangtai specializes in loading local paper. (4) Ente and Annetta specialize in loading local goods. The four ships Ente, Annetta, Mufulu, and Xinxiangtai are scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Taizhou or Wenzhou for transfer to Ningbo tomorrow. When departing from Shanghai, in addition to carrying passengers to Taizhou and Wenzhou, they will also load goods approved for import into Zhejiang Province. The designated transport ships for the Wenzhou-Taizhou-Ningbo line are the Meda and Tangsai.</p>
<p>Freight Rates Reduced by Half</p>
<p>Regarding the freight rates of each ship, due to the soaring price of coal after the war and the increased costs, as well as the detour, the passenger and freight rates between Shanghai and Ningbo have continued to increase, causing a sudden increase in the burden on merchants and travelers in eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, Zhou Dalie, chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, sent a letter requesting a reduction. After the news spread to Shanghai, Zhu Meixian, manager of the Ningshao Steamship Company in this city, responded immediately and telegraphed the Joint Conference of the Ningbo County Party, Government, Military, and Police, requesting approval for direct Shanghai-Ningbo shipping to reduce the expenses of each company, and thus the freight rates should be reduced.

<p>Ningbo Situation: Tranquil as Usual</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were rumors that Ningbo had been bombed by Japanese aircraft a few days ago. People from Ningbo living in Shanghai were concerned about their hometown and inquired about each other. According to employees of the Mufulu who arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning, Ningbo has not seen any Japanese aircraft since November 11 of last year, when a few small bombs were dropped. The recent rumors of bombing in Shanghai are clearly false. At present, the market in Ningbo is becoming more prosperous, especially the Jiangbei shore and Dongmen Street, which are even more bustling. The local order is quite peaceful.</p>

<p>Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the founder of Fudan University, is currently residing in Guilin, Guangxi, and this year he reaches the auspicious age of one hundred. Alumni of Fudan from all over have sent congratulatory telegrams. The General Association of Fudan Alumni in this city specifically telegraphed the Chongqing Branch, forwarded to the directors of various schools stationed in Chongqing, requesting the National Government to issue a commemorative stamp. The telegram stated, "(Omitted above) Mr. Ma Xiangbo, founder of our alma mater, is a great elder of the world and a contemporary master. This year he reaches the age of one hundred, a cause for celebration not only for those who have studied under him but also for the nation. Moreover, in times of chaos and famine, people's hearts need to be uplifted. Our association hereby proposes requesting the National Government to issue a commemorative stamp to show the utmost respect for the virtuous and the elderly. We ask for your wise decision and proceed accordingly, and hope to hear back from you."

Like those who lived in seclusion in He Fen and taught at Luo Chuan, you possess a spirit of harmony and nurture a virtuous heart. All call you a learned scholar, and all praise your teachings. You are the great elder of our age, and all recommend you as the paragon. This year, we joyfully celebrate your centenary birthday, reaching the age of great completeness. Like Zhang Cang, who was nurtured on breast milk, we sing of eternal blessing in poetry. Unlike Liao, who sought immortality through elixirs, you are far beyond those who carried a cane in their home village. Accomplishing great deeds, words, and virtue, you are nearly perfect. The star of the old man appears, foretelling auspiciousness in the South Pole. The Tao respects the teacher, gazing eastward. We, your students, have been scattered by war, having barely survived this calamity. The vast ocean is where we now call home. We wish to follow in your footsteps, hoping to be among the disciples of Shen Gong, and aspire to enter your chambers and study the teachings of Han. Like cutting water to dye the clouds, or pouring silver and jade, we send our humble respects from afar, but lack the skill to craft eloquent praises. Our joy is deep, and our expression is endless. We specially send our congratulations, and respectfully wish you peace."</p>

<p>All tenants of Jinle Lane, Weihaiwei Road, jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Special Zone Rental Dispute Mediation Committee, stating that the management office of the lane, Tongyuan Bank, has increased the rent by 40% per month from January 1939 and requires that the rent be paid in full by the end of December. In addition, various expenses such as tap water must be paid in legal tender, so the rent in the lane will also be changed to cash payments. After discussions among the tenants, they unanimously refused to recognize this unreasonable rent increase. In addition to forming the Jinle Lane Tenants' Association to refuse the increase and sending a letter to the management office to take note, they specifically stated the reasons and requested the committee to mediate.</p>

<p>Postal delivery between Shanghai and Hankou has been restored, and the resumption of postal services in Anqing is also being prepared. However, outside information is unclear about the post office situation, and there are many inaccurate reports. The various situations are listed below:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hankou Postal Delivery Restored</p>
<p>For mutual delivery of mail between Shanghai and Hankou, the mail sent from Shanghai to Hankou was loaded onto Japanese merchant ships on the 3rd of this month. The first batch of mail sent from Hankou to Shanghai was transported back to Shanghai on Japanese ships on the 10th of this month. Detailed postal information on that aspect will be available after the official letter from Smith, the postal director of Hankou, arrives with the first batch of mail loaded for Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Prepares to Restore Anhui Postal Services</p>
<p>The mail currently being sent and received between Shanghai and Hankou is entirely limited to light items. "Light items" includes regular letters, postcards, registered letters, and express letters. Small parcels, bulk packages, and remittances are beyond the scope of light items and cannot be delivered. The Shanghai Postal Administration has dispatched Japanese postal workers Fukuka Yutaka and Okada to the Anqing Postal Administration of the Anhui region to prepare for restoration. It is hoped that this will be realized soon.</p>
<p>Post Office Faces Difficulties</p>
<p>Currently, the Shanghai Postal Administration has three Japanese postal workers working in the office. In addition, there are 21 Japanese mail inspectors stationed in the office, arbitrarily inspecting mail in various departments. As for the restored postal services in the guerrilla areas, due to the pressure of evil forces, their environment is becoming increasingly difficult, which is inevitable. Therefore, the post office feels very difficult.</p>

<p>The Continental News reports that Sir Sassoon, a prominent businessman in this city known as "the richest foreigner in China," has recently remitted a large sum of money from his London residence to the Committee for the Re-establishment Fund for German Jewish Immigrants in this city. The fund aims to assist German Jewish refugees in this city to engage in various businesses. The committee has already helped refugees open clothing stores, etc. Just when the fund was lacking, they suddenly received a telegram from Sir Sassoon announcing a large donation, like a withered seedling</p>
<p>Suddenly Receiving Timely Rain</p>
<p>However, the exact amount cannot be disclosed at this time. According to committee chairman Spielman yesterday (the 10th), "We intend to provide assistance within our means, but there are no fewer than 1,500 immigrants in Shanghai. The scale of this work is evident from this. The Re-establishment Fund is different from the ordinary fund for maintaining immigrants. Currently, the ordinary fund requires 90,000 yuan per month." Jewish immigrants have already</p>
<p>Found Employment</p>
<p>A considerable number of immigrants have found employment. The committee has appealed to the Shanghai International Red Cross to assist in maintaining immigrants more economically, as the Red Cross has rich experience in providing relief to Chinese refugees. Yesterday, Dr. Baker, an executive of the Red Cross, replied to a reporter's inquiry that the committee is now discussing the issue of immigrant meals, which can reduce the monthly cost of meals to five yuan per person. Currently, the cost of meals alone for each immigrant exceeds 30 yuan per month.</p>
<p>Continuing to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that the ship Victoria arrived in Shanghai on Sunday (the 15th), carrying 200 Jewish people expelled from Germany. The total number of German Jewish immigrants in Shanghai will thus increase to more than 1,700 people. This confirms that the ban on immigrants coming to Shanghai has not yet been implemented.</p>

<p>Previously, due to the frequent occurrence of terrorist cases and murders within the Public Concession, the Public Concession Police Authority established Criminal Section No. 8 for the purpose of dedicated investigation, selecting seven Chinese detectives and three Western detectives to specialize in the matter. After the establishment of the section, it arrested important members of the "Yellow Way Society" who had created terrorist incidents and handed them over to the First Special Court for severe punishment, greatly reducing the number of terrorist incidents in the Concession. Now, the authorities believe that public order within the Concession has gradually returned to normal, making it unnecessary to establish a separate special section. Therefore, on the 9th of this month, an order was issued to abolish the section, and all personnel of the section were transferred to Criminal Section No. 1 for office work. After receiving the order, the section immediately announced the cessation of office work on the 9th, and unfinished matters were transferred to Section No. 1 for handling.</p>

<p>At around 6 a.m. yesterday morning, an incident occurred on Xiaoshadu Road, Hongshui Lane in West Shanghai in which Italian soldiers opened fire and shot a Chinese man. At the time, a Chinese man named Chen Peiqing, originally from Yixing, 44 years old, resided in a lean-to in the lane. Chen got up early in the morning to go to Laohushe to soak in the water and was about to return home. Needing to relieve himself, he urinated in the lane. This was seen by an Italian soldier in the area, who, seeing Chen acting hastily, immediately shouted loudly to stop him. Because Chen did not understand the Italian soldier's language, he hurried to his residence. The Italian soldier became even more suspicious, thinking that Chen was a criminal element, and immediately raised his rifle and fired two shots, hitting Chen in both legs. Chen immediately bled and fell to the ground. The incident was learned by the Putuo Road Police Station in charge of the area, and they immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and transported Chen Peiqing to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. According to news last night, Chen's life is expected to be out of danger after treatment of his injuries.

<p>Li Shiyang, former Director of the Zhengtai Railway Bureau from Hubei, originally had a legal wife, Shou Shi (named Yu), and a concubine, Wu Wenhua. In 1933, he separated from his concubine and ordered his wife, Shou Yu, to live in Peiping with their children. While in Shanghai, Li became involved with Sun Huifen, a woman from Dongting Mountain in Suzhou, the divorced concubine of his sworn brother surnamed Wang.</p>
<p>They Lived Together in an Affair</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1937, Li's wife, Shou Shi, came to Shanghai from Peiping with her children to escape the war. After living with Li, Li died in Guangci Hospital in October of that year. Shou Shi handled the funeral arrangements. Because Sun had taken over funds that Li had given her before his death, Shou Shi discovered that Sun Huifen had committed adultery and lived with her deceased husband during his lifetime. Shou Shi then filed a private criminal prosecution in the Second Special Court against Sun Huifen for disrupting the family. Sun also went to the civil court of the Second Special Court to</p>
<p>Request Confirmation</p>
<p>of Ownership of the deposit. This is currently on appeal. Now, Sun Huifen's father has hired lawyers Ma Shouhua and Cheng Shangfeng to represent her in filing a lawsuit in the civil court of the Second Special Court against Li Shouyu to confirm her identity. The reason given is that she formally married Li Shiyang in Hangzhou on April 18, 1936, and that Li stated beforehand that he had divorced his wife, Shou Shi, in 1933, and</p>

<p>Cao Hongyi, manager of the Yitai Shipping Company, previously chartered the Wanna, a ship flying the Italian flag owned by the company, to Luo Wanxiang, owner of the Guangdong Road Gongda Customs Brokerage, through the intermediary of Shi Guangchang. Luo then formed the Hankou Shipping Company and appointed Shi as its manager to operate the shipping business. Later, Luo claimed that Shi and others could not obtain a sailing permit issued by the Japanese from the Tianli Shipping Company and did not deliver the chartered ship as scheduled. Cao, on the other hand, claimed that Luo did not pay the rent. As a result, disputes arose between them. Luo then accused Shi, Cao, Wu Chaohua, Ma Chengben, the Yongbo owner of the Yuantai Heng Paper Store on Fada Road, and Huang Zhichu, a certain ship comprador, of jointly</p>
<p>Obtaining Property by Fraud</p>
<p>and reported them to the Huishi Police Station. Detective Tao Gengrong successively arrested and detained the defendants for questioning at the First Special District Court. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing opened a court session and ordered the five defendants, Shi, Cao, Wu, Ma, and Huang, to be brought to court for further trial. First, the plaintiff, Luo Wanxiang, detailed the sequence of events, stating that he first met Shi Guangchang through an introduction from a Mr. Sun in June of last year. Shi was engaged in the business of ship brokerage. In November, Shi came to him and said that Yitai Company had an</p>
<p>Italian Ship</p>
<p>called Wanna for charter. The ship could sail to the ports, and he could also handle the insurance policy and permit. The monthly rent was 11,700 yuan in legal tender. As he wanted to rent a ship for the aforementioned route, he visited the ship the next day and, at Shi's suggestion, paid a deposit of 2,000 yuan in foreign currency. Later, on the day of signing the charter, he had someone bring 5,000 yuan to Shi's office in the Hamilton Building to pay. However, the conditions stipulated in the contract were not what he originally intended, and he was very dissatisfied. On that day, Shi also asked him to lend 2,000 yuan to Wu Chaohua, saying that Wu was one of Yitai's shareholders and had considerable authority</p>
<p>to Facilitate the Loan</p>
<p>and ensure early delivery of the ship. However, after the loan was given, the ship could still not be delivered on the agreed date. At that time, he had also learned that Yitai was not able to charter the Wanna. On the morning of December 6th, Cao Hongyi, Chen Peijun, the owner of the Lida Customs Brokerage who is now the chairman of the trade association, and a Mr. Zhou came and said that there were internal disagreements within Yitai and that the ship could not be chartered. They asked to stop payment of the 6,700 yuan check for the continuing rent, which was due on the 6th. As he happened to be out of the office, his accountant, Shen Weidong, and associate manager, Yuan Jialun,</p>
<p>Both Witnessed</p>
<p>and heard it. Therefore, he did not cash the check. That evening, Shi suddenly visited with a Japanese person. The Japanese person said to Shi, "If you hand over the ship, I will take you to Hongkou and kill you." Although these words were addressed to Shi, they were in fact intended to intimidate him. He issued another check for 4,700 yuan to Shi. However, as he already knew that the ship could not be chartered, he immediately notified the bank the next morning to stop payment of this 4,700 yuan check as well. As for commissioning Shi as manager, it was because Shi said that after the ship was chartered, it had to make a mandatory transport to Hankou for the Japanese military. He thought this was the work of</p>
<p>A Traitor</p>
<p>and did not want to come forward himself to take responsibility for the establishment of the Hankou Shipping Company, so he gave Shi the title of manager to do it together. Later, Shi knew that many things had not been handled properly and resigned himself. In total, he was defrauded of 7,000 yuan in cash and a 6,700 yuan check. The ship has not been delivered to this day. The defense lawyers for the defendants, Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, Jiang Yiping, and others, then successively attacked the points in Luo Wanxiang's testimony that were not in accordance with the facts, saying that the bank where Luo issued the check had only a few yuan in deposit on the 6th, and that Cao Hongyi and others</p>
<p>Did Not Notify Stop Payment</p>
<p>on the morning of the 6th, and that among the 7,000 yuan that Luo successively paid, there was also a 500 yuan check that Shi had advanced. However, Luo's employees, Shen Weidong and Yuan Jialun, testified in court that Cao and the other three had come to the Dagon Customs Brokerage that morning to actually notify them to stop payment of the check. The court immediately questioned Cao about this. Cao testified that he went to inform Luo to prepare cash that morning, because the check had already been transferred to someone else and had to be cashed, and he never told him to stop payment. Detective Tao then reported that the Wan Na ship had not been received by the plaintiff, according to investigation, and was still being held by a certain party. However, the defendants' lawyers requested that the ship's whereabouts be investigated with Customs. The court then ordered all defendants to be returned to custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Driver Runs Over and Kills Person, Trial Concluded and Awaiting Verdict <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jinfang, a driver of bus number 47 of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, drove bus number 15119 of route 9 to the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession at around 9 a.m. on December 16 of last year. In order to avoid pedestrians, the bus ran onto the sidewalk, hitting and killing pedestrians Zhang Miaorong and Zhang Guoren one after the other. Zhang Guoren's head was crushed, a particularly tragic sight. The French police arrested the driver and filed a public prosecution in the Second Special Court for causing death due to professional negligence. The trial by Judge Sun Pengham has not concluded. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Liao Yuanwei, acting Judge of Criminal Court No. 1, announced a renewed trial. The defendant hired lawyers Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong to defend him. First, Gu Shouxi, a lawyer representing the French Concession administrative authorities, presented the case. The part concerning the victim Zhang Miaorong has been settled with compensation from the company. Only Zhang Guoren's wife, Zhang Wu Shi, and her lawyer came to court to request redress and additional compensation of 6,480 yuan. Witnesses Zhang Yaoshan and Wang Rongbiao then testified that the defendant was driving fast. When questioned, the defendant Wang Jinfang testified that at that time, around 9 a.m., there were many cars on the road and he could not drive fast. However, public buses are different from ordinary vehicles. The bus was very crowded with passengers and the bus itself was very heavy and could not drive fast. He really could not avoid the pedestrians, causing him to run onto the sidewalk and cause the accident. He asked for leniency. After examining the testimony, the court held that the facts of the case were clear and ordered the opening of arguments before announcing the conclusion of the trial. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 18th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Selling Stolen Ducks, Arrested and Questioned, Claimed They Were Stolen, Still Pending Investigation and Verification</p>
<p>Shen Tingfang, a Ningbo native, 43 years old, manager of the Hexing Chicken and Duck Company at 659 Sanma Road in this city, sent people to Ningbo at the end of last month and spent more than 3,000 yuan to collect 4,200 fresh ducks. After slaughtering them, they were packed into 24 wooden boxes and 15 barrels and hired the Jinlongxing civilian boat to transport them to Shanghai for sale. At 4 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, when the boat arrived near the port of Nanhui in this province, it was intercepted by pirates who stole all the ducks. After being robbed, the boat came to Shanghai to report to the Hexing Chicken and Duck Company, which sent people to investigate. On the 9th, they found that Tang Lianchu (29 years old), a Nanhui native, was peddling the skinned ducks to the Gongmao Catering Company at 20 Caishi Street in the French Concession. They went to the Gongmao Catering Company to inquire that afternoon and happened to see Tang negotiating a deal to sell 769 skinned ducks to Li Hongsheng, the manager of Gongmao. Shen Tingfang, the manager of Hexing Company, reported this to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Tang Lianchu. He was escorted to the 8th Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday and questioned by Judge Wu Kechou. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that the defendant was suspected of theft and requested a postponement of the investigation. The defendant hired lawyer Mao Xiankun to defend him. When questioned, the defendant Tang Lianchu testified that he was in the wild game business and that vendors from the countryside transported goods to Shanghai for him to sell to various catering companies. He claimed that two boatmen in Nanhui told him that their boat was stranded in shallow water and that they were afraid the goods would spoil and peddled the ducks to him, so he bought them for 825 yuan and transported them to Shanghai to sell. He did not know that they were stolen goods. The plaintiff then requested that the detained ducks be returned to him first. Finally, the defendant's defense lawyer stated that the case could not prove that the defendant was suspected of theft, because the plaintiff's goods were robbed on the afternoon of the 2nd, and at that time, the defendant was still in Shanghai. Moreover, the place where the incident occurred was in Nanhui, and the jurisdiction of the court could not be determined according to the agreement. He requested that the defendant be allowed to be released on bail pending trial. After considering the circumstances, the court ordered the hearing to be postponed to the 18th and released him on cash bail pending investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e100">"Astrologer" Misleads the Public with Falsehoods, Young Woman Thoroughly Bewitched, Defrauded of More Than 6,500 Yuan, Husband Demanded Money and She Finally Revealed the Truth <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, an astrologer named Lin Musen appeared at No. 18, Lane 641 (i.e., Diecun), Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai, greatly promoting himself, exaggerating to his heart's content, and the Jianhua Broadcasting Station even made broadcasts to promote him, causing countless superstitious people to be lured into his illusory traps and lose their assets. In fact, this charlatan is by no means a Liu Junping of his time. His original name is Hua Dawei, from Wuxi, and he is only around 30 years old. In previous years, he was hired by the police as a translator, but was dismissed after only three days due to incompetence. Later, he had a falling out with his wife and was sued for divorce. Therefore, he repeatedly changed his name afterwards, such as Hua Renzhong, Hua Dongwei, etc., all of which were names he used in the past.</p>
<p>He Called Himself an Astrologer</p>
<p>and used the name Lin Musen to carry out his deceptive skills. A young woman surnamed Xue, who lived at No. 82 Jing'an Temple Road, was attracted by the exaggerated words of the radio broadcast and went to seek a fortune-telling in June of last year. The woman and her husband happened to be not very harmonious, and Hua discovered her secret feelings. He then used this weakness to make inflammatory remarks, exactly catching the woman's itch and making her think he was psychic. Therefore, Hua induced her with his supposedly miraculous skills that could restore her marital love and gave her a small amount of white powder, telling her to secretly put it in the tea</p>
<p>For Her Husband to Drink</p>
<p>Afterward, her love would increase. He charged 20 yuan in legal tender for the powder. The woman returned home and followed the instructions, but the powder floated on top of the tea, so she dared not give it to her husband. Later, Hua ordered her to put it in the porridge instead, but there was no obvious effect after taking it. However, at this time, the woman was deeply bewitched and not only did not realize it, but also obeyed Hua's every word. Hua then enticed her with wealth, taking out a black, hard object from the furnace one day, saying it was</p>
<p>Transmuted Gold</p>
<p>First, he scraped off the dirt on the surface of the object with a knife, and a yellow color appeared. To strengthen the woman's trust, he took her to the Qutianbao Silver Shop, where it was verified that there was indeed some gold in it, worth 19 yuan. Another day, he gave the woman a small box with yellow paper talismans inside, telling her to bring it home and wait until late at night for a sound to come from the box. The God of Wealth would then descend from Guiyang. He has used such tricks countless times over the past six months, and each time he did, he asked the woman for money. The woman first used the legal tender from her home, and when the legal tender was exhausted, she used gold jewelry.</p>
<p>The Woman Was as If Drunk, as If Mad</p>
<p>Every night she only hoped that there would be a sound in the box and ignored her sleep, so she has now become ill due to insomnia. Her foolishness is indescribable. By the end of the lunar year, her husband needed money to use and asked the woman for it. The woman could not respond and only then did she fully reveal the deception she had suffered. He immediately reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives Wu Chengmo and Liang Yuliang, along with Western detective Luo Linyong, to Diecun to investigate and arrest him. However, Hua had already heard the news and fled far away. It was not until the night before last that they learned that he was with</p>
<p>His Paramour Serving as a Guide</p>
<p>Jin Xiuqin, hiding in the Central Hotel. They went to arrest him, confiscated eight pawn tickets and more than 190 yuan in legal tender, and took them back to the police station. After questioning, Hua was detained until yesterday morning, after releasing Jin, and escorted to the First Special District Court. According to police lawyer Qian Xunjiu, the cash and jewelry that the defendant defrauded were worth more than 6,500 yuan. Judge Dai questioned the defendant, who also admitted to the untruthful statements. He was then ordered to be held in custody pending another hearing.</p>

<p>Yao Yuxiang, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei living at No. 53, Yuchang Lane, Caishi Road in the French Concession, had a five-year-old daughter named Xiaozai Zi. At 0:17 p.m. on the 10th, while walking on the side of the road in front of No. 262, Caishi Road, a French-owned Route 18 trolleybus No. 151 driven by Yang Along was speeding from north to south. The girl was unable to avoid it and was knocked down by the rear wheel on the right side of the trolleybus, running over her lower body and legs. The skin and flesh of her right leg were completely</p>

<p>a tragic sight. The police recorded the number and sent the injured child to Guangci Hospital, but she died without treatment at 1 p.m. The body was carried to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Also, Chen Shougao, a Taizhou native, 42 years old, was walking on the side of the streetcar tracks at the intersection of Huangpu Tan Road and Taiwan Road in the French Concession at 7 p.m. on the 9th. A French-owned Route 10 streetcar was traveling from south to north. Chen</p>

He confirmed that they had died from injuries sustained after being hit by the streetcar. The families of the deceased, Yao Yuxiang and Chen Youzhi,</p>
<p>Petitioned for Redress.</p>
<p>The official questioned the defendants Yang Along (driver of Route 18 trolleybus No. 211) and Qiao Shouguang (driver of Route 10 streetcar No. 272) about the circumstances of the accident, and then ordered that the two bodies be handed over to the families to be claimed after they signed a statement. The defendants were escorted to court by the police in accordance with the law for questioning. It is said that the French streetcar company believes that the two drivers were not at fault and that the deceased were to blame, so they refused to pay any compensation to the families of the deceased. Both families of the deceased are laborers and have no money to collect the bodies of the deceased.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Concluding the Dispute Over Relocation and Rent <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Yimin, a native of Nanhui, also known as lawyer Wang Youlin, previously rented a house from Mr. Yu Hong at No. 16 Beiler Road in the French Concession. Due to accumulated rent arrears, Mr. Yu Hong repeatedly sued in the Special No. 2 Court to recover the rent and demand the eviction of the premises. After a final judgment was made in favor of Mr. Yu Hong, the court repeatedly ordered enforcement without success. On December 15th of last year, the enforcement division of the Special No. 2 Court, along with bailiff Shen Qing and court police officers, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives from the French police station, and Mr. Yu Hong, accompanied by his attorney Yin Tinghua, went to No. 16 Beiler Road to enforce the eviction. Although Mr. Wang had already left the house, he still had office equipment and a cook inside. After the bailiff carried out the eviction and moved Wang's belongings outside the door, three tenants of the house, Yao Wu Zhiying (the wife of Yao Gucheng, a secretary of the Ministry of Judicial Administration), and Chen Gengsheng (an employee of the 45th Reception Center), among others, engaged lawyers Tang Hao and Zhang Weiqing to file a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court against Mr. Yu Hong, his attorney Yin Tinghua, the bailiff Shen Qing, and the court police officers, accusing them of damaging furniture, public insult, injury, defamation, and obstructing freedom, and seeking compensation for losses through a civil suit. The defendants retained lawyers Wang Shizong and Zhang Juansheng, among others, to defend them and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The case was heard twice. The previous report noted that the plaintiff Chen Gengsheng, on behalf of Tao Zhendou, accused lawyer Yin Yanhua of ordering him to sign a pledge to move and affix his fingerprint. The debate on this case has concluded, and at 9:00 AM yesterday, Judge Jiang Liquan presided over the trial in Criminal Court No. 2 and acquitted both parties and rejected the plaintiff’s attached civil suit. It is said that the civil court also confirmed Wang's responsibility for the entire eviction through another case. This brought an end to a pointless dispute over the Wang-Yu relocation issue.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhixiang, a 49-year-old native of Ningbo, was a boatman involved in commerce. Since the outbreak of the war, he had been unemployed and idle, suffering economic hardship. He conceived the idea of suicide. On the afternoon of the 9th, at 4:00 PM, he went to the Anshang Inn at No. 33 Balizhao Road in the French Concession, claiming to be staying in room 53. He committed suicide by drinking poison. The waiter Tan Amao noticed that Zhang was still sleeping late into the afternoon the next day and knocked on the door, asking if he needed anything for the room. After a long period of silence, he managed to break open the door and found that Zhang had already died. He reported it to the French police, who transported the body to the autopsy room of the Tongren Funeral Home. Gao Jingming, a 26-year-old native of Luodian, also committed suicide due to economic hardship. On the afternoon of the 8th, he went to the Huaxing Inn at No. 322 Mintinenyin Road in the French Concession, renting room 17 and drinking poison. The waiter Tang Sanlin discovered it at 9:00 PM that night and reported it to the police, who sent him to Renji Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and he died at 3:00 AM on the 10th. The hospital notified the French police, who transported the body to the autopsy room. Yesterday, the Special No. 2 Court was notified, and Prosecutor Wang Ren visited the location. The autopsies revealed that both Zhang and Gao died from poisoning. Since the families of the two bodies could not be located, the officials instructed that the bodies be handed over to the charity for burial, pending identification by relatives.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," the Italian ship "Libia" was once strafed with machine guns by pirates, resulting in the death of a Chinese passenger. Therefore, the crew was exceptionally cautious. Yesterday (the 10th), the ship returned to Shanghai. About twenty miles upstream of Wusong, they spotted a sailboat. The crew observed it with binoculars and saw that the sailboat was very busy, with machine guns and rifles set up. The "Libia" increased its speed and managed to escape danger. The pirate ship did not have a chance to fire a shot. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The fact that it had no bulletproof equipment and was not robbed was indeed fortunate. According to reports, this was the fourth time in two days that ships had encountered pirates in the Yangtze River. On Sunday afternoon, the "Libia" was attacked, resulting in the death of a Chinese passenger. An hour later, the German ship "Hansa" was also strafed with machine guns and rifles by pirates in the same area, with at least sixty rounds fired, injuring two passengers. On Sunday, the tugboat "Hanhe" and two other tugboats were also fired upon with machine guns by pirate ships, but the ship continued sailing. They later telegraphed for help and the British warship "Gull" arrived, causing the pirate ships to flee.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Securities and Public Debt Experience Another Sudden and Significant Decline - If It Is Not Understood Why They Rose in the Past, It Is Impossible to Know Why They Are Falling Today - Moreover, There Is a Rumor That Interest Will Be Paid in Chongqing - However, Foreign Debt Market Conditions Are Also Limited in Supply <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities market experienced a relatively large reversal. This was a reaction to the breakthrough of successive increases and the discovery of new peaks. Since December 12th of last year, it has been driven by various favorable circumstances, resulting in a sudden rise. On December 23rd, Class A broke through the 60-yuan barrier and rushed to 61 yuan, breaking the previous high of 60 yuan and 8 jiao on May 9th of last year, when the Taierzhuang victory was achieved. In the subsequent half-month, a new record of four consecutive high prices was discovered. In total, the increase in two weeks was as much as 12 yuan. The intensity of the surge was considerable. However, this was only because Class A was uniquely endowed, so its rate of progress was also more rapid than other types of securities. A sudden surge caused a reversal, which was also an inevitable obstacle in the process of the surge. The current situation is that only spot transactions are taking place, which is completely different from the previous futures market. The previous surge did not rely on multiple parties pushing up prices, but on short covering. Today's surge, while it also does not rely on multiple parties pushing up prices, solely relied on the non-outflow of spot goods. Yesterday's rebound was largely influenced by the outflow of spot goods on the 15th. The market was under new pressure and felt unsupported, and the Qianye Gang also sold to the market in the same way. The support of retail investors was insufficient, and many fell sharply by more than one yuan. In the afternoon, there were even unfounded rumors that the interest payment would be changed to Chongqing to avoid the outflow of cash. However, some people believed that this was not true. Xie Da Ho reportedly sold a lot in the market, and Tiansheng Ho also came out, but most of the buyers were retail investors, but the market then read 60,70 jiao. These rumors should become clear within a day or two, and the financial community will certainly not admit this statement. Let us record it to be verified. The resulting market prices fell sharply across the board, ranging from one yuan and three jiao to one yuan and eight jiao. The total transaction volume was more than 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading was sluggish due to the busy trading of public debt. There were many inquiries about shares of the Securities Exchange on the market, but there were no matching parties.</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign debt listed prices on the 10th of this month (Tuesday) were weak. British and French loans and British bond bills fell by another three pounds, priced at fifty-two pounds. Crisp bonds continued to fall by half a pound, priced at thirty-six pounds. Each of the Huguang Railway bonds fell by one pound. Non-German-issued bonds were twenty-three pounds, and German-issued bonds were twenty-one pounds. Yesterday's opening trading included a British gold settlement bond and a German-issued bond, with a transaction price of forty-seven pounds. The spot supply of British gold settlement bonds was quite lively. One thousand pounds of British-issued bonds were sold for fifty-three pounds and fifteen shillings, a slight discount of five shillings from the market. Another nine thousand pounds of German-issued bonds were sold for forty-eight pounds and five shillings. Another transaction of two thousand pounds was sold for forty-eight pounds. Furthermore, five thousand pounds of Belgian-issued bonds were sold for forty-eight pounds and five shillings. Another ten thousand pounds were sold for forty-seven pounds. In addition, three thousand pounds of Crisp bonds were sold for thirty-seven pounds, a premium of one pound from the market.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Finance - Pure Gold and Long Foreign Exchange Are Tight - Cooked Gold Rises Another Seven Yuan - Closed at the Highest Price Yesterday <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's after-hours market for cooked gold cash saw prices continue to rise. This was because British and American pure gold had reversed from falling to rising, the domestic market for foreign exchange in this city was soft, and a certain money exchange business was actively purchasing on behalf of clients. As a result, the confidence of all parties was further enhanced. Although silver houses and gold shops frequently tried to suppress prices along the way, they did not have any impact. As a result, it continued to rise by 7 yuan. Trading was quite brisk in the morning and quiet in the afternoon. There was no change in jewelry gold. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold have stopped falling and rebounded.</p>
<p>Cash Customers Make Aggressive Advances</p>
<p>The initial opening price in the morning for each bar (ten taels) was 1,991 yuan, which was due to the appreciation of British pure gold and the good appetite of a certain money exchange business. At that time, sellers were scarce. Then, after 9:45, silver houses began to sell, with a certain money exchange business purchasing a total of 100 taels from silver houses, opening at a price of 1,991 yuan. Subsequently, the foreign exchange was reported to be weakening, so the price rose again by several yuan. A certain money exchange business purchased another 50 taels from silver houses at a price of 93 yuan. The same price was paid by gold shops to money exchange businesses for 50 taels. Money exchange businesses traded 50 taels at 95 yuan. After that, a stalemate gradually developed. Money exchange businesses traded another 20 taels at 93 yuan. A gold shop sold 50 taels to a money exchange business at 94 yuan. Finally, a gold shop sold another 20 taels to a money exchange business at 93 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. Trading was even quieter in the afternoon due to the lack of market for foreign exchange on Wednesday and the scarcity of sellers. However, the appetite of a certain money exchange business was still good, so prices rose several yuan again. After 3:00 PM, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange business at 95 yuan, and another 50 taels at 96 yuan. After that, the supply and demand became even scarcer. Since there was still no opening trade at 4:00 PM, the closing price for the evening was still 1,996 yuan, a surge of 7 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The price of cash shop's brand name gold was 2,005 yuan when sold to retail buyers and 1,990 yuan when bought in, and it did not open lower compared to the listed gold of fifty yuan.</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate for Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange rate for silver house jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged. Datong Hang still quoted the original price of 202 yuan, and Xintong Hang quoted 200 yuan when selling and 194 yuan when buying.</p>
<p>The British Exchange Recovers Weakness and Pure Gold Rebounds</p>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 10th, British pure gold was affected by the weakness of the British exchange, so it rebounded by four and a half pence per ounce, reaching £7 9 shillings. The central bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold also rebounded to 1,216 yuan, 3 jiao. The listed customs gold also rose by 6 li, totaling 2 yuan, 4 jiao, and 3 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 3 yuan, totaling 1,211 yuan, 6 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Heavy Demand for Foreign Currencies <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British gold rose by four "ban shi", the British-American exchange rate increased by 0.0625, foreign exchange settlements were very active, and the demand from Japanese banks was quite strong. However, supply was not smooth, so the trend was weak. The Chaozhou and Guangzhou banking groups were actively seeking funds, but the amount of available funds was small and the supply was limited. The market price gradually increased with a strong upward trend. There was heavy demand for foreign currencies at the retail level, all trending upwards, presenting a firm and active market. There was some trading activity in the guild. Yi Kang issued a British gold bill of 30 pounds to Cheng Tai. They also issued a U.S. dollar bill of 100 yuan to Shanghai Yin Hao. Ying Feng issued a Hong Kong bill of 200 yuan to Shanghai Yin Hao. They also issued a Hong Kong bill of 600 yuan to Hong Yu. Jin Da issued a U.S. dollar bill of 900 yuan to San Tai. Bao Cheng issued a British gold bill of 100 pounds to Tong Feng. The market prices yesterday were as follows: British gold pounds rose by 2 jiao, British gold bills rose by 2 jiao, U.S. dollar pounds rose by 1 jiao, U.S. dollar bills rose by 2/3 of a fen, Hong Kong bills rose by 1 fen, French franc bills rose by 1 li, Singapore bills and Dutch bills both rose by 3 fen, rupee bills, Canadian bills, and Philippine bills all rose by 2 fen, and Australian gold bills rose by 2 jiao. Only Annam bills, Italian bills, German gold bills, and Siamese bills remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Japanese Traders Actively Buying Foreign Exchange, British-American Exchange Rates Continue to Weaken, Hong Kong Exchange Rate Particularly Tight <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market saw a slight outflow of Hong Kong telegraphic transfers, but due to active buying by foreign firms and Sassoon, a Western trading company, as well as active absorption by a certain Japanese bank, and tight supply from various foreign banks, the underlying trend continued to weaken. The Hong Kong exchange rate was particularly tight, with extremely active trading.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large silver bar and New York silver prices remained unchanged. London spot gold recovered by 4.5 "ban shi". The exchange rate for British pounds against U.S. dollars was up by 3 li, against French francs up by 15 centimes, and against Shanghai unchanged. The U.S. dollar rose against the British pound by 0.0625, against French francs remained flat, and against Shanghai decreased by 3 fen. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The bank opened early, with the spot selling price for British exchange at 8.746875 "ban shi", and for U.S. exchange at 16.46875 yuan, both flat compared to the previous close. After the opening, Chinese banks engaged in some trading. Telegrams from abroad indicated a large sale of U.S. dollars at 16.5 yuan, and foreign firms also began buying actively, immediately creating a tight market. The U.S. dollar settled at only 16.4375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates and the silver equalization tax announcement remained unchanged. Subsequently, due to active competition among foreign firms and Sassoon, and increased buying by Japanese banks, coupled with tight supply from foreign banks, the situation became increasingly tight. British gold weakened to 8.4375 "ban shi", the U.S. exchange rate rose to 16.40625 yuan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate tightened to 56.5 yuan due to good bank purchases. Near noon, exchange shops repeatedly sold Hong Kong exchange, but foreign firms continued to absorb it well, so the situation softened slightly. At noon, exchange shops were less willing to supply, and the rate tightened again to 56.375 yuan. The bank's selling price at noon was 8.421875 "ban shi" for British exchange and 16.40625 yuan for U.S. exchange. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate tightened by 0.046875, the U.S. exchange rate weakened by 0.0625, and the Hong Kong exchange rate tightened by 0.0625. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The trading records for Tuesday are listed below.</p>

<p>A London telegram dated the 10th stated that speculators were selling while India was buying, resulting in a stable market. After closing, the market remained flat. At the listed price, there were some sellers. The large silver bar's near and far terms remained unchanged. A New York silver telegram stated that the U.S. silver price remained unchanged with no real market activity.

<h3 id="e126">Food: Little Improvement in Flour and Wheat <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market remained stable. Sales from both northern and southern merchants were decent, but sales from major merchants were temporarily difficult to expand due to high transportation risks and lack of profit. Factories, however, felt that production and inventory were insufficient, and had the intention to raise prices. As a result, the price remained unchanged, with the Shantou-Minnan and Hebei-Shandong merchant groups each selling over 10,000 bags. There were also retail sales of around 8,000 bags, mostly Che Chuan brand and Tian Zhu Yu Weng No. 2 flour, with a selling price of 4.9 jiao. 9,200 bags of flour will be exported to Xiamen today (12th), and 1,000 bags to Shantou. 2,000 bags of bran will be shipped to Xiamen, and 4,000 bags to Xingang.</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat arrivals by train and wheel totaled over 2,000 bags. Factories continued to show little interest due to cheap overseas wheat prices and price cuts by foreign flour. The domestic wheat market was sluggish. Total transactions were only 6,000 bags, equally split between Fuxin and Fufeng factories, at a maximum price of 6.7 yuan. There was little improvement in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Port Rice Falls by About 2 Jiao <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>1,500 bags to be shipped to Xiamen today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, domestic rice arrivals included 8-9 boats of river rice and 7-8,000 bags by train. Local merchants adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and sales slowed further. Stockpilers took the opportunity to resell, further weakening the market. Transactions were minimal, with thick and thin japonica rice falling by another 1-2 jiao, and Du Yang tip rice also declining by several fen to 1-2 jiao. Port rice fell more sharply, by about 2 jiao, due to the influence of guest rice. Bian Yuan rice also fell by 1 jiao. Yin Yuan rice, however, remained scarce, with Jiangyin rice opening at 13.6 yuan, only 2 jiao below Bian Yuan rice. Today, 1,500 bags of rice will be shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Nanjing Xian Rice Remains Stalled <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Guest Xian rice arrived by both train routes. Sellers aimed to adjust prices according to the market, but local merchants showed little interest due to the high supply and low prices of river rice. Both guest and stockpilers were sluggish, with only a few hundred bags transacted at a price reduction of 4-5 fen. High Wu Xian rice maintained a price of 10.04 yuan, while medium quality rice was weak. Sellers of Nanjing Xian rice were unwilling to sell cheaply, so prices remained high.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Yarn and Cotton: Many Scatter, Hasty Settlements, Yarn Prices Fall Sharply, Each Brand Falls Around Ten Yuan, Japanese Yarn Changes Along with Chinese Yarn <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to slump, and the decline showed no sign of abating. The continuous surge in actual green prices had been too drastic, and coupled with strong absorption by fellow traders, a slightly unfavorable environment triggered hasty settlements. At the same time, customer sales could not be said to be small. Given the fluctuating market prices, it was natural to temporarily avoid risk and reduce purchases. As a result, scattered bulls and those with small profits rushed to sell, resulting in a temporary oversupply in the market, and prices plummeted. But in reality, there should have been a rebound correction to facilitate actual transactions. Instead, prices were raised higher and higher without end. The market conditions yesterday were as follows: (The opening was stagnant, with the opening price increased by 5 jiao. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 392 yuan. Ten bales were transacted among traders. Customer demand was insufficient, and floating holders competed to sell, shrinking the market further to a low of 382 yuan. Then, due to the low price, a certain company came to absorb, and the market rebounded by 2 yuan, closing at 384 yuan. However, small transactions continued among Yunnan and Wenzhou traders. The total transactions in the morning were 854 bales, with the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn down 7.5 yuan from the previous day, Te Jin Cheng down 12 yuan, Double Earth down 9 yuan, Tian Nu down 9 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn down 8 yuan. Factories remained inactive. 89 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, 170 pieces to Shantou, and 140 pieces to Hong Kong yesterday. The quantities bought by each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Traders 495 Ningbo 7</p>
<p>Yunnan 125 Xiamen 5</p>
<p>Shantou 35 Wenzhou 175</p>
<p>Fuzhou 2 Jiangxi 10</p>
<p>Total 854</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market was entirely determined by the changes in Chinese yarn, but its range of fluctuations was only one-tenth of that of Chinese yarn. Yesterday, the spot price of 20-count Suiyue yarn was 311 to 311.5 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn was 309 to 308.5 yuan, both down 2.3 yuan from the previous day, but transactions were sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Dasheng Factory in Major Cotton Producing Area Purchases Tongzhou Cotton in Shanghai, Distorted Phenomenon After Control, Chinese Factories Order 6,000 Bales of Indian Cotton <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The native cotton business saw a price decline of about 1 yuan due to factory closures, largely due to continuous price increases and a decline in the yarn market. The American and Indian cotton markets also saw declines, making them relatively cheaper. Even the once-powerful coarse cotton was affected by Indian cotton and weakened. Factories' order quantities gradually increased. There were no transactions in daily cotton. Japanese factories had no intention of touching high-priced Chinese cotton. Strangely, the Nantong Dasheng Factory, located in a cotton-rich area, was unable to purchase raw materials and instead came to Shanghai to purchase 1,000 bales of Tong cotton for use in its Nantong factory. This distorted phenomenon highlights the difficulties faced by factories. Hongzhang Factory only purchased 61 pieces of 42-count native cotton, with the rest being transactions among traders or offset against other transactions. The supply from northern Jiangsu was smooth, with 1,390 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 225 bales of Changyinsha cotton, 200 bales of wood rack cotton, and 390 pieces of North Sha cotton arriving. The current market is listed below:</p>
<p>Foreign cotton prices: American cotton has been falling for several days, leading to large quantities of cotton being pledged at loan offices, reducing the availability of cotton in the market. Currently, all industries are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the cotton market, awaiting confirmation from Washington. Yesterday, the New York cotton market rose initially due to positive news from Liverpool, but then weakened due to selling by New Orleans and profit-taking by bulls, resulting in a decline of 3-4 "bang yin" compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 1 rupee, while Egyptian cotton fell by over 40 "bang yin". The exchange rate softened yesterday, and when converted to legal tender, all foreign cotton prices fell, with American, Brazilian, and Indian cotton each falling by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton falling by over 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton transactions in this city: Due to the high prices and lack of available quantities of native cotton, Chinese factories showed strong interest in purchasing foreign cotton. Some Chinese factories had already placed orders under stringent conditions, while others were still resisting purchases. Yesterday, Japanese factories held meetings and did not engage in large-scale transactions. The transaction amounts and current spot market prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, Dalian soybean oil futures and spot prices both turned downwards. This was due to the decline in the Dalian market, as well as the influence of exchange rates, leading to a lack of confidence and a sharp drop in the market. One-month forward contracts first opened at 27.4 yuan, down 3 jiao from the previous day. Then, floating stockpilers sought to sell, causing the price to plummet to 27.1 yuan. The market remained weak at closing. Spot oil also fell by 2 jiao, but Yanqi oil rose by 1 jiao due to scarce supply and active sales. Transactions included 50 barrels of Dalian oil, 100 barrels of one-month upper delivery contracts, and over 350 barrels of one-month lower delivery contracts. There were also 400 pieces of Dalian Qidou oil, 50 barrels of Juese Fengnian oil, 1,000 cans of Suifeng factory canned soybean oil, and 100 pieces of Yanqi oil. Exports included 700 pieces of crude oil to Xiamen, 1,440 cans and 350 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Soybean Cakes Break Through the 3 Yuan Barrier <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, under the tight grip of owners, the soybean cake market broke through the 3 yuan barrier. Transactions included 2,500 pieces of Daya factory's Four-brand cakes at a price of 3.02 yuan, purchased by Xiamen merchants. 500 pieces were shipped out. Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants purchased 1,000 pieces of Changzhou Xiefeng factory's Five-brand cakes at a price of 2.85 yuan, and over 1,700 pieces of Jiangbei small soybean cakes. The current trend is influenced by the shortage of Changzhou Four-brand cakes, as well as the low supply of factory cakes. Prices have broken through the barrier, and the market remains active.</p>
<p>Today, 1,100 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Shantou, 1,210 bags to Xiamen, and 1,900 bags to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Dried Goods: Extremely Scarce Hunan Lotus Seeds, Even Worm-Eaten Lotus Seeds Fetch Good Prices <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds were difficult to obtain and arrivals were scarce, so market inventories were dwindling, and prices were soaring. The previous market price had reached 125 yuan, but recently it has become even scarcer, pushing prices higher. Yesterday, local lake lotus seeds reached 130 yuan, remaining active. Even worm-eaten goods fetched 75 yuan, highlighting the scarcity of goods. (Yesterday's news about the continued arrival of Hunan lotus seeds was mistakenly printed as lake lotus seeds and Chao lotus seeds; this is hereby corrected.)</p>
<p>Yesterday's imports included 120 bags of walnuts, 70 bags of peach kernels, and 160 bags of dates, all shipped from Tianjin.</p>
<p>Today's exports include 500 bags of raw kernels to Xiamen, and 560 bags to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, over 1,100 boxes of oranges arrived from Fuzhou. Yesterday, another 10,760 boxes arrived from Xiamen, and over 1,170 pieces of kiln goods arrived from Shantou.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Piece Goods: Supply of Grey Cloth Not Sustained, Factories Temporarily Delay Offering Colored Twill, High Prices of Domestic Cloth, New Transactions Slightly Reduced, Sales of Eastern Piece Goods to Dyeing Industry Remain Strong <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The market was stable. After the surge in sales prices of fine cloth and fine twill, purchases slackened somewhat. Sellers were willing to slightly loosen the price by 1-2 jiao per piece to sell off hand goods. The supply of Cannon Brand fine cloth, produced by Tianjin Hengyuan Factory, was lacking. Merchants from Ningbo and Taizhou showed interest and purchased around 150 pieces of futures contracts for this month. The market remained particularly strong. The coarse cloth market showed signs of recovery. Merchants from Shanghai and Ningbo and Shaoxing purchased over 100 bales of Ewo goods and sold at the original price. The supply of goods was slightly low. Tong Yi's brand of 14-pound coarse cloth was purchased by traders, and the market price returned upwards. Underwear from brands like Zhenzhong and Jiufu each rose by 1 jiao per piece. Sales were mostly for previously ordered goods that had yet to be delivered, and tight credit and high market prices reduced new transactions. However, because the supply of grey cloth for colored twill was not sustained and demand was strong, factories temporarily delayed offering it for sale and focused on delivery. Ouhai, Ningbo, Shaoxing, and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi railway line had the largest shipments. Sichuan merchants were also active, continuing to purchase over 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, printed cloth, and colored yarn. 800 pieces of colored twill were shipped overseas to Singapore.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The morning market continued its downward trend, but the afternoon market rebounded slightly. Fine cloth was down another 1 jiao per piece from the previous day, and fine twill was down about 5 fen. Merchants from Tianjin purchased and sold in small quantities, with little addition. Other merchants took a wait-and-see attitude, and there were not many transactions. Only the local dyeing industry group continued to purchase actively, taking advantage of low prices to absorb goods without holding back, as the sales of colored cloth remained strong. Yesterday, a major wholesaler purchased 500 pieces of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth in bulk. There were also 400-500 pieces of scattered dye blanks sold. The traders said that even though the market was small, prices remained firm.</p>
<p>Exports: Today's exports of piece goods include 38 pieces to Shantou, 33 pieces to Xiamen, and 11 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Flying Unicorn brand starch is exclusively sold to Western medicine merchants. In previous years, sales were not high, so the local inventory was scarce. The usual market price was above 20 yuan. As the new goods are about to arrive and production has greatly increased, large shipments are expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. Currently, the price of this brand of starch has fallen to 17 yuan.</p>

<p>Betel nut peel from Luzon previously sold for 115 yuan. Because it was profitable, the arrival of goods was continuous. Currently, local inventories are abundant, but sales have slowed down. The day before yesterday, only a few dozen pieces were sold, and the price was down by over 20 yuan. The market was flat.</p>

<p>Supplementary Education Association Sets Youth Self-Cultivation Implementation Methods, and Formulates Self-Cultivation Curriculum Distribution Table</p>
<p>The "Outline of Vocational Youth Behavior Training" formulated by the Shanghai Supplementary Education Association has been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the Youth Self-Cultivation Implementation Method is listed below:</p>
<p>Article 1: Member schools of this Association should add self-cultivation class time from this year, at least 15 minutes per week. The methods can adopt one of the following: 1. 15 minutes per week per subject. If the teacher of the subject has research on youth self-cultivation, the teacher of each subject will be responsible. 2. 15 minutes per week per subject, taught by full-time teachers in rotation. 3. Within the same time, all students in each subject should be divided into several groups according to similar levels and taught together for one hour. 4. Within the same time, all students in each subject are taught together for one hour. This method is quite problematic in terms of student level. Note: No matter which method is used, the arrangement of teaching materials should have a strict system, and students should have prescribed reading materials. It is not advisable to talk at will, resulting in superficial and empty content.</p>
<p>Article 2: Member schools of this Association should pay attention to student behavior training. The methods can adopt several of the following: (1) Setting behavioral standards; (2) Holding individual talks; (3) Training leading students; (4) Guiding collective organizations; (5) Instructing collective work; (6) Encouraging each other to improve and help each other; (7) Implementing self-criticism; (8) Promoting the spirit of hard work; (9) Maintaining the continuity of behavior.</p>
<p>Self-Cultivation Curriculum Distribution Table: Level 1: Basic Morality; Level 2: Service Morality; Level 3: Skill Cultivation; Level 4: Physical Cultivation; Career Problems; Level 5: Introduction to Career Outlook on Life, Introduction to Leaders; Level 6: Service and Life; Level 7: The Life of Struggle; Level 8: Youth and Leaders. Note: If a brief lecture method is used, each level is one semester; if a detailed lecture method is used, each level is one academic year. The above methods are just a rough outline. If there are better methods, it is okay to make changes.</p>

<p>(5) The time for implementing family education is as follows: (A) "Sundays" will be held every Sunday morning or afternoon, with a limit of two hours each time; (B) "Other holidays" - excluding winter, summer, and spring breaks, the lecture time for other holidays will be the same as Sundays.</p>
<p>(6) The operation of family education classes should utilize the original classrooms and equipment of each school.</p>

Now, in order to meet the needs of society, the school has decided to restore the senior high school chemical engineering department, first setting up one class for the first grade. Major chemical factories in Shanghai are also willing to support it and are looking forward to its success.

<p>In the Xiqing basketball game last night, there were originally three games, but the game between Pengbi and Aurora was postponed, so there were only two games left. Guoguang vs. Tianxing took the stage first. Chen Hongqi and Li Zude of Guoguang scored one after another. Xu Jusheng of Tianxing pulled back two points. Guoguang took the lead all the way, leading the first half with 27 to 18. After changing sides, Guoguang's momentum was very strong. Li Zude and Wang Nanqun repeatedly broke through the basket, and the score soared. Tianxing relied on Xu Jusheng and Zheng Boyi to try to follow, but it was still of no help to the overall situation. As a result, Guoguang easily defeated Tianxing with 50 to 33. Then, Taishan played against Zhizhi. The strengths of both sides were similar, and the competition was quite fierce. Chen Wenkui of Zhizhi took the lead in scoring. Zhang Jinxiang of Taishan responded with color. Wenkui made another contribution, and Wang Xengeng and Zhuo Guorong each scored one point, making it 5 to 3. Zhizhi was two points ahead. Taishan suddenly succeeded.

<p>(Pittsburgh, 10th Reuters) The two giants of world professional tennis, Bokey and Fances, continued their tour. Yesterday (9th), they played the fifth game in Pittsburgh. The competition between the two sides was extremely fierce. Bokey won the first set 8 to 6 first, and then Fances won the second set 6 to 3. In the third set, after a 22-game battle, Bokey won the final victory with 12 to 10. This score is one of the closest scenes since the two giants played against each other. Bokey and Fances have now played five games together. Bokey won three and Fances won two, which seems to prove that the current world professional tennis champion is no longer Fances, but Bokey.</p>

<p>In a football friendly match, Park United played against North Xitong at Jiaozhou Park at 3 pm yesterday. Park United's lineup was sparse due to the absence of strong players such as Shen Jinda and Cao Qinfang. North Xitong is a Group C team, but it has three players from the Group B team to help out, and its strength is not weak. After the start of the game, Xu Sitevitz of North Xitong opened the scoring. Wen Shengqin also made a contribution. Xu Lian scored four more goals. Wen and Nasfobai also each scored one goal. Park United had a penalty kick opportunity, which was scored by Tao Jinrong. In the first half, North Xicuan led with 8 to 1. When the battle started again, Na Sifubai took the lead in registering, and Wen Shengqin also broke the net. Then each side had a penalty kick, which was saved by the goalkeeper. Under Park United's hard counterattack, Lin Shaojun lived up to expectations and scored two consecutive goals, but unfortunately, Wen Shengqin scored a penalty kick again. Finally, Kuierzhi's high shot worked, and Park United suffered a miserable defeat to North Xitong with 3 to 12.</p>

<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>——Impressions of a Wartime Journey</p>
<p>One clear early winter morning, I climbed alone from Ehu Academy along the leaning pagoda to the peak of Fenghu Mountain. The morning sun had just risen, and the thick fog filled the valleys. The white camellias by the roadside were covered with dewdrops, which made them look particularly vibrant. That day, I didn’t know whether it was because this famous place where the philosophers Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan had held their meetings had aroused my nostalgia for the past? Or was it because the cold and solemn atmosphere of early winter had stimulated my imagination? I felt a little different in my heart. I thought silently and walked slowly, thinking that Zhu and Lu had discussed their studies here in the past, with their own similarities and differences. They walked hand in hand, sometimes silent, sometimes arguing fiercely, sometimes in agreement. I wonder if they also thought that thousands of years later, from the same to the different, from the different to the same, many magnificent waves would be created?</p>
<p>Just as I was meditating and feeling at one with the spirit, the buzzing sound of an airplane in the air interrupted my thoughts. At that time, I suddenly changed my mind and raised the following question: Suppose Zhu Xi and Lu Xiangshan were both born in modern times, and Lu Zuqian (a master of the Jinhua School) who had some differences with Zhu and Lu also came to Ehu to participate in the discussion. When the three of them were arguing fiercely, and neither would give in, the enemy's plane came. What would be the attitude of the three of them? This is indeed worth thinking about. Lu Xiangshan might sit upright and look unchanged. Zhu Xi might think of the sage's way of exercising power and the ancient訓: "A gentleman does not stand under a dangerous wall." Lu Fanqian, on the other hand, would probably immediately stop participating in the debate and feel that digging an air-raid shelter was more practical than philosophical debate. After the plane passed, who was right and who was wrong could be written on everyone's pen; but if the disciples in Ehu Academy were young people who were studying now, their judgment could be made immediately, because they believed that the enemy's plane would really drop bombs and blow Lu Jiuyuan, who was sitting upright, into meat pie. They would feel that the realistic path taken by the Jinhua School was the right path.</p>
<p>When going down the mountain, the spire of the leaning pagoda touched another thought in my mind: Ehu Academy, this Confucian holy land, and Hongji Temple on Fenghu Mountain, that Buddhist holy land, what kind of relationship do they have? Could it be that the leaning pagoda at the foot of the mountain is the dividing line between your territory and mine, and they will not glare at each other? Or Lu Xiangshan's attitude is closer to the side of Fenghu Mountain, Zhu Xi belongs to the circle of Ehu Academy, and Lu Zuqian is outside the circle of Ehu. Their disciples' attitude towards the monks in the mountain temple must be fundamentally different. If we continue to deduce in this way, the problem will become more and more complicated. That morning, a philosophy of life matured in my heart—a philosophy of life in troubled times.</p>
<p>Between Fenghu Mountain and Ehu, there is a fundamentally different view of life. Buddhism advocates the beauty of stillness, taking "Nirvana" as the destination of life. Confucianism advocates the beauty of movement, taking "self-improvement" as "the great way of change. Lu is biased towards Buddhism, so he advocates "understanding the mind and seeing the nature. Zhu is biased towards Confucianism, so he advocates "exhausting the principles and dealing with things as one. Lu Zuqian, Ye Shuixin, Chen Tongfu and the Yan and Li schools in the early Qing Dynasty are closer to Confucianism, so they advocate "experiencing the world and studying the economy. (Economy refers to people's livelihood economy.) The beauty of stillness is easy to understand. People in middle age understand the taste of leisure and comfort even more. The beauty of movement, however, cannot be appreciated without the courage to face reality head-on. What comes with movement is a chaotic reality. People who are used to a leisurely life only know that chaos is just making fun of their life order. No old law can let him deal with it well. Turmoil makes him headache, and constant headaches. When he understands that under the turmoil, the stream of life is active, and that stream of life is leaping forward, it makes him feel headache again. Therefore, Zhu Xi is confined to the circle of Ehu, and Confucianism also only maintains itself in the doctrine of the mean. In troubled times, "the doctrine of the mean" is not enough. You must have a more positive attitude towards life.</p>
<p>As the Western saying goes, "Young people have more enthusiasm and less light, and middle-aged people have more light and less enthusiasm." The turbulent world is a world of fire. Only those who have more enthusiasm can catch up.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Evacuation <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>The bugle played a majestic tune atop the ancient city wall, the bayonets gleamed brightly in the rising sun; although it was the cold of winter, the morning breeze still carried some warmth, caressing that group of soldiers who had arrived last night.</p>
<p>I watched the soldiers running nimbly, busily dispersing into the various city streets and outskirts. That kind of impassioned and brave spirit made me realize that a fierce war of attrition was about to unfold here.</p>
<p>Indeed, time no longer permitted non-combatants to linger in this ancient city. The amiable military police also came to urge the people settled in their homes to evacuate to the surrounding countryside. The tense and solemn atmosphere diluted the selfish notions of a group of people and increased their awareness of displacement. Thus, we treated this ancient city wall as a friend bidding farewell on a journey and left it ordinarily.</p>
<p>Farewell, ancient city wall! In the future, when we return, the beautiful land will have been restored to its completeness, the powerful nation will have gained its freedom. On that devastated scorched earth, we will surely be able to rebuild a beautiful homeland! Now, filled with hopeful excitement, we can only support the frail elderly, lead the children, and follow the guiding military police, solemnly and orderly walking through the narrow city streets, passing through the half-collapsed archway of the city gate, squeezing through the crisscrossing barbed wire, and rushing to the thriving and prosperous rear!</p>
<p>Like flowing clouds, the crowds of people writhed on the empty country roads, scattered into who knows how many groups! Some climbed the high mountains, some skirted the forests, some crossed the shallow rivers, some had already disappeared beyond the reach of the human eye, hidden; only the troops arriving to set up defenses rushed forward like trains, their figures growing from small to large, marching in the opposite direction of the evacuating crowds, rushing to the positions surrounding the ancient city; those tightly packed and connected heroic soldiers, like the newly emerged wheat seedlings in the spring fields, revealed a vigorous and thriving spirit, and with the gentle sunlight shining on them, their greatness and nobility were even more apparent!</p>
<p>All of this added to the expectations of the non-combatants and strengthened the belief in victory among those being evacuated. In the tense atmosphere, everyone entrusted the mission of luring the enemy deep into the country to the ambushing groups of brave soldiers, everyone eagerly hoped that the empty dead city would become the tomb of the invaders.</p>
<p>Go, go! As I followed the last group of strong men evacuating and passed through the barbed wire, I occasionally looked back and gazed. Oh! On the ancient city wall, there was only solitude and emptiness, a different kind of sternness, a different kind of indifference, which made me shudder violently and quickened my pace to hurry forward.</p>
<p>On the cleared and fortified country roads, the number of people decreased with each step forward. By the time I could no longer see that ancient city, no longer see those fields and rivers, no longer hear the loud and solemn bugle, I was the only one left, walking alone on the rugged mountain road. The sun climbed to the top of the sky, transforming into a strong pale light. Intense</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Veritable Record of a Beard <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Qiang</p>
<p>When I accidentally yawned, opening my mouth to exhale a bellyful of idle air, the corners of my eyes also wrinkled into 'a pool of autumn water'! (It should be solemnly declared: there are no flirtatious glances here. All my compatriots, please release your serious interpretations.) - Before I reached out to cover my face, I felt it was the most leisurely moment of spiritual refreshment since the start of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>But the situation was not that simple. 'The three paths are overgrown!' I immediately felt something 'thorny' on my upper lip, and not without 'domineering' tendencies.</p>
<p>In deep regret, I realized that this action was not an intentional provocation or a plot to subvert: it was just that after a 'yawn', there seemed to be such a move as a matter of course; the greatest effort, the ultimate task, was nothing more than massaging, appeasing the muscles after the movement, to see if they would 'submit'.</p>
<p>However, this - was not only superfluous, but indeed self-inflicted trouble, finding a few intractable strands of sorrow, causing a burst of grief.</p>
<p>'Looking in the mirror', I didn't have that courage; 'tracking' was even more troublesome; although China has stepped into a great era of transformation, people should have 100% 'positivity'. But I, this time, neither 'tracked' nor bothered to 'look in the mirror', which was a bit self-abandoning. In fact, why not tolerate this eccentricity? Moreover, let 'domineering' be 'domineering', I will be 'careful' with 'fire', and I will not fail to be a member of the post.</p>
<p>Raising a beard, it's a long story, and I still find it annoying.</p>
<p>Recalling the period of the Purification Movement, in the dormitory, there were indeed a few beards that had no 'rhythm' and whose 'structure' was not 'purely strange', and they were under serious surveillance. The interrogator felt that the evidence of the crime was insufficient and glared angrily. It is said that he also issued such an astonishing conclusion:</p>
<p>'Beards like this—seeing the behavior, being well-behaved is never well-behaved!'</p>
<p>At that time, although I didn't expect that 'Sima Guang' would later become 'Marx', I swept my smooth lip plate and, 'favored by nature', was overjoyed and settled down to find some extracurricular reading such as 'Sima Guang's 'Zizhi Tongjian' and other books.</p>
<p>However, whenever I think of those beards that were like weasels because of 'slovenliness' and a few unloved revisions, my heart can't help but thump and feel that 'saving the country should slightly forget the beard'.</p>
<p>Facts are the most eloquent. The more I 'don't forget', the more 'domineering' the beard becomes. Half a lifetime of floating and sinking, the few rare Qingchun style and some vigorous 'crazy and simple taste' have been swept away by a few desolate beards. In fact, why bother to circle around this physical problem.</p>
<p>However, friends tidying their collars and 'purifying the family', have not failed to think of eradicating the beard as 'the top priority' and 'getting to the root and clearing the source, nothing else can be done'. According to the reports of most experienced people, the more reliable standard technique is: rather than diligently weeding afterwards, it is better to uproot the seedlings from the front. Therefore: 'shaving is not as good as trimming; trimming is not as good as plucking'; a series of theories like strings of beads are naturally produced. The activists hold this 'fundamental cure' 'century-old plan' and apply it greatly to copper coins, 'nitpicking' on the respective lip plates. If there is a cause for 'eating slot machines', then at least it should be recognized that the copper coins for eating beards (tigers) are a 'one good turn deserves another' trace.</p>
<p>Since the passage of the proposal for a controlled economy, in a short period of time, there has been a problem of insufficient circulation of hard auxiliary coins in the market. Friends who have always used copper coins to clamp their beards to implement their ideas are naturally inseparable from this economic condition, and can't help but 'look at each other' and 'worry too much'. Although women and young ladies don't fail to sympathize with the beards 'no copper coins to soak in water' and easily take out a few from their waists to temporarily relieve the famine; however, using this warm copper coin to secretly pluck the beard will not only not feel 'gentle and affectionate', but in addition to 'copper stench', there will probably also be 'copper stench'.</p>
<p>Material conditions have caused most young beards to pick up scissors and make decisive decisions; but 'adhesive plaster', the father comes in tracking. Although this is an exceptional encounter, 'planning ahead', we should finally 'make do' a little.</p>
<p>In fact, these things are all self-inflicted troubles. Later, there was strong evidence that the short, small, and capable beard is the driving force behind all 'kissing'. This made many friends wake up, change their style, and cancel all the 'cutting' and 'plucking' claims that they had always maintained firmly. And the raw devouring and meaningless destruction that the beard had suffered before were all saved. Loving it and wanting it to live, shaving it and wanting it to be hard, frequency is a quick decision policy.</p>
<p>However, I myself am still a laggard, in the surging tide of 'plucking', I don't follow; in the increasingly intense tide of 'shaving', I don't trace. Finding the lip plate in the desolate weeds, leaving this wilderness in the world, what good is it?</p>

<p>— Yun Zhan</p>
<p>Ermaozi raised his eyebrows and suddenly jumped up, pointing his finger directly at his wife's nose and roaring, "Bullshit! What did you say? What did you say!"</p>
<p>His wife fell silent, lowered her head, and patted the baby in her arms to feed him.</p>
<p>The child, who had been drowsily sucking on the nipple and about to fall asleep, was startled by his outburst and began to cry again.</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell me to go and be a robber, a thief? Wouldn't that be cleaner!"</p>
<p>His wife remained silent but raised her head to stare at him, her eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>This softened Ermaozi. The child kept crying, and he felt that the air in the room was unusually restless. Ermaozi pushed open the window, exhaling deeply as he gazed at the sky.</p>
<p>There was a moon and stars in the sky, as well as drifting clouds, but in Ermaozi's eyes, it was just a blur.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, the child stopped crying, and his wife patted him and put him to bed. Only then did he turn around, looking at her thin back, the clothes from a year ago looking like they were hanging on a bamboo pole. He couldn't help but feel a wave of sadness, sighed deeply, and sat down silently.</p>
<p>His wife watched his face and slowly said, "I was just discussing it with you, it's not like I'm definitely telling you to go... Why do you always get so angry? Do you know how bad your temper has been lately?... When it comes to being a robber or a thief, it's all because there's no food to eat. I've never seen anyone with clothes to wear and food to eat going to rob or steal. But there are many people who take this path who are very respectable, very valued. Take Master Yang, for example, does he lack anything to eat or wear? Besides, if you go, you'll just be working by his side, it's not like he's directly telling you to be a slave and smile at people. It's also Liu Erge's kindness, running over to invite you, if you don't go, he's afraid he won't have any other friends? People can't even get this opportunity!" She sighed slightly, "With your temper, if Liu Erge knew, how could he save face?"</p>
<p>"What do you know? You always have so many crooked arguments!"</p>
<p>"I told you I was just discussing it with you... It's not like I'm rushing you, the rent is three months overdue, and we need firewood, rice, and pocket money every day! We've pawned everything, and there's nowhere to borrow from!... I know your temper, if we could barely get by, I would have already refused for you. Who doesn't want to hold their head high and live with dignity!" She paused for a while, "So I think we should have a way to make a living, we can't just open our eyes and wait to starve to death!"</p>
<p>Ermaozi frowned, not answering.</p>
<p>The air in the room seemed very heavy again.</p>
<p>A series of leather shoes sounded on the stairs, and someone came up.</p>
<p>"Er Mao brother!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Liu Erge!" His wife rushed to answer, letting him into the room.</p>
<p>Ermaozi greeted him, and seeing Liu Er wearing a new set of clothes, he couldn't help but feel a wave of disgust in his heart.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when Liu Er sat down, he also sighed, "Sigh! When there's nothing to do, you can't borrow a single penny; when they hear you have a job, they borrow twenty yuan in one go; and they even ask me if it's enough! You think, even your own relatives are so snobbish!"</p>
<p>"Ah, Erge, you're too difficult, it's not good to borrow, and it's not good not to borrow," his wife said quickly.</p>
<p>Ermaozi smiled slightly.</p>

<h3 id="e160">On Knowing Contentment <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Yi</p>
<p>People's desires are endless, especially those of ambitious young people! They only know how to envy and resent! They don't understand the words "contentment brings happiness." We must know that we should always strive for development, but we will never be able to get our way in one fell swoop. We should both take advantage of opportunities or pay attention to opportunities, and at the same time, we should always maintain an optimistic attitude and spirit. In this way, we can comfort ourselves. If you don't believe it, we can understand it by talking about our clothing, food, housing, and transportation!</p>
<p>When we are dressing, we must always want to wear silk that costs two or three yuan a foot, or a suit that costs more than a hundred yuan, but no, we must never have such wishful thinking. We only need ordinary clothes that can resist the cold and protect our bodies, which is enough. What's more, compared to those refugees who have no house to live in and no clothes to wear, or those ragged beggars, it is really much better.</p>
<p>When we are eating, we must always want to eat Western food, taste delicacies such as shark fin and sea cucumber, but no, we only need something that suits our taste, is hygienic, and can fill our stomachs. In this way, compared to those who have nothing to eat, or those who beg from door to door, it is already much better.</p>
<p>When we live in a house and sleep on a hard plank bed, we must always want to live in high-rise buildings or Western-style houses, and the best thing to sleep on is a Simmons spring bed, but no, we only need to be able to avoid wind and rain, sleep well, and be hygienic. Compared to those who have no place to live, hide in the alleyways, and sleep on the cement, it is really much better.</p>
<p>When we are sitting in a tram, seeing the streamlined cars speeding by, we also wish we could go out and sit in a car, and enter the door and sit in a car; but if we think of the rickshaw drivers and trishaw drivers who run around for life all day long, it is really much more fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Chinese Cheongsam Popular Overseas <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Feifei</p>
<p>Most Chinese people like to wear Western clothes. According to those who like to wear Western clothes, there are two reasons: one is to show off and learn the current trends, as if wearing a suit and leather shoes can show that they are modern people. The other is to take advantage of its convenience and liveliness, because Western clothes are not only good-looking in form, but also lighter and more refreshing than long robes. However, on the contrary, some foreigners like to wear Chinese clothes; for example, many American women like to wear Chinese cheongsams, and they consider it a way to show off. Therefore, in recent years, China's silk fabrics have sold well in the United States, but unfortunately, the import tax in the United States is too high, and the tax on silk fabrics and embroidery is as high as 120%. For this reason, it is quite difficult for China's silk fabrics to be exported to the United States. Similarly, there are also many women in Japan who love Chinese cheongsams, and they are very popular.</p>
<p>Speaking of Japanese clothing, its forms and styles still follow the legacy of the Tang and Song dynasties in China. This kind of clothing is not only inconvenient, but also very cumbersome. The curves and lively postures of women are also completely concealed by it, which is really very ugly. For this reason, in recent years, Japanese women have also advocated the improvement of clothing, but because of long-standing habits, it has been ineffective. As a result, Chinese cheongsams became popular in Tokyo. At first, only geishas and cafe waitresses wore cheongsams; in recent years, the scope has become wider and wider. General new drama actors, movie stars, and even noble women are all competing to wear them, and gradually, this trend of liking to wear Chinese cheongsams has spread throughout the island nation.</p>
<p>But one thing is regrettable, that is, although Japanese women like to wear Chinese cheongsams, there is no tailor shop in Tokyo that specializes in making Chinese clothes. Although there are also a few Western clothing stores opened by Chinese people in Tokyo, they only know how to make Western clothes, and it is not very good for them to make Chinese clothes, especially cheongsams. If the style looks like it is behind the times in the eyes of Shanghai people, otherwise, if there were also a few fashion tailor shops in Tokyo that specialize in making Chinese clothes, which can innovate like Shanghai, I believe that Chinese cheongsams will still be popular in Japan for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Hitler Likes to Eat Eggs <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Meng</p>
<p>People who do great things often take their daily lives the most lightly, are not concerned, and implement them in the simplest way; in fact, they use their energy in big places, so it is difficult to take care of trivial matters.</p>
<p>So Hitler was no exception. He did not haggle over everything in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, especially food, which was even more casual. He could eat any dish and eat it with relish, which was even more difficult!</p>
<p>He did not smoke or drink, that is to say, he had no bad habits; sometimes he only ate two meals a day, lunch and dinner; this determined the amazing amount of food he ate, he could finish the dishes for two meals at once! However, among many dishes, eggs accounted for the largest part of his diet, that is, he liked to eat eggs the most. He often ate eggs cooked in various ways; he had a dedicated chef who could cook eggs in more than 30 ways. If he needed to attend a meeting, he would order the chef to personally bring the eggs and slices of black sturgeon to cook; when he ate alone, he would simply boil the eggs for a while, which was his specially selected food! However, he also often ate fish, chicken, raw vegetables, and vegetables cooked with butter; in short, his meals were very casual!</p>
<p>Under this kind of nutrition, he gradually gained weight, and his physical strength gradually increased. His two jaws slowly hung down, and his abdomen was also undergoing abnormal inclined activity, which was too worrying for him, because he still wanted to be the dictator of Germany forever, even the world; but this was too harmful to his ambition!</p>
<p>Benito was very clear that the spirit of a great leader is closely related to his food preferences, so he once said like a theorem: "Ambitious people are absolutely not allowed to eat large amounts of steak"!</p>
<p>Hitler's sleep time was 10:00 pm. He often said: "Insufficient or too much rest, whether physically or mentally, is not beneficial to life, especially for those with great ambitions"!</p>
<p>News about eating Wu people like snacks, and they like to fill their stomachs with soup balls for breakfast, which can be more or less depending on the amount of food. In the past, before the war, there was a shop in Qiaojiazhai in Nanshi, which was famous for making soup balls. The soup balls they made had a firm and solid meat filling, and the powder was smooth and glutinous. When you bite into it, the meat soup splashed everywhere, and the taste was extremely delicious. Ordinary gourmets each bite off the skin, leaving the meat filling, and then add some vermicelli to serve as a meal, which is like a bowl of vermicelli meatball soup. There is also a kind of tendon-free vegetable dumpling, which was only sold in a shop at Sanpailou in the city 30 years ago. It is made with vegetarian vegetables without tendons, selecting the tender leaves, and then adding refined ingredients. It is fragrant, crispy, smooth, fresh, and delicious. In recent years, I have never seen other shops selling it. Recently, I heard that Qiaojiazhai Soup Ball Shop has reopened at No. 276 Alber Road, and there are also vegetable dumplings for sale. The telephone number for delivery is 73050. Ordinary gourmets can once again feast on them.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The weather is cold, and water freezes into ice at night. This is the best time to make frozen tofu. You only need to buy a board of old tofu and put it in the patio or on the drying platform overnight. When you look at it the next morning, it will have frozen. If you are too lazy to do it yourself, then go to the tofu shop to buy it, you can also buy it, but the price will be more expensive; and you have to buy it early, because there are many people who like to eat frozen tofu, if you go late you will not be able to buy it. Frozen tofu is delicious whether it is cooked vegetarian or with meat. For vegetarian food, use fragrant mushroom tips, add good soy sauce, and cook with pagoda vegetables. You don't need to add seasonings, and it feels very delicious. It is also OK to cook meat with pork slices or diced meat, that is, mutton or beef. All auxiliary products can be added as much as possible to make a ten-scene casserole frozen tofu, which is especially delicious and endless. However, whether cooking with meat or vegetarian, you must add a lot of soup, because the soup here is also a delicious taste that you must try.</p>

<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>The esteemed Chairman Lin, despite his advanced age and high position as Chairman of the National Government, does not seek comfort or luxury in his personal life due to his age, nor does he become arrogant or selfish because of his high office. He is not hypocritical, cruel, nor is he cowardly or reclusive. He is always upright, frugal, gentle, and kind, fully embodying the inherent virtues of the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>Whether he is working in the office or resting at home, he always wears a long robe and short jacket. In spring, it is a thin cotton robe of blue silk; in summer, a long white linen gown; in autumn, a thin silk cotton robe with a mandarin jacket; and in winter, a sheepskin robe with a black woolen overcoat. In spring, autumn, and winter, he always adds a blue cloth cover-up over his long robe to protect it from getting dirty. He only takes off the cover-up when attending National Government meetings or banquets hosted by important people. Therefore, the clothes he wears are always so clean and tidy. When there are grand ceremonies, such as the New Year's Day awarding of medals and the presentation of credentials by foreign ambassadors, he changes into a brand-new blue silk long robe and black satin mandarin jacket of national dress. The materials of these clothes are absolutely all domestic products. He has not bought a single imported item in nearly thirty years, which is also a merit that most people do not have.</p>
<p>His daily food is no different from that of ordinary people: a few vegetables, a bowl of white rice, and a bowl of thin porridge. Tofu and eggs are the most common among the vegetables. However, he has a standard for food, which is: "Hot, soft, and bland." Only food that meets these three conditions can he eat.</p>
<p>What does "hot, soft, and bland" mean? "Hot" means that whatever the food is, he will not eat it if it has lost its heat. "Soft" means cooked and tender. Vegetables must be cooked until soft over a low fire for a long time, perhaps because his teeth are not suitable for eating hard food. "Bland" means not salty, because if food is too salty, it will inevitably leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth and require drinking a lot of water, which can cause stomach bloating. This is also a hygienic issue worth noting.</p>
<p>The furnishings in his residence are very simple. The bedroom is almost the same as an ordinary person's bedroom: a bed, a square table, a desk, two chairs, and a coffee table. He rests, gets up, reads newspapers and books, and reviews personal letters in this small room. Because he loves antiques, he also displays some musical instruments, chess, calligraphy, paintings, vases, swords, stoves, fish tanks, etc. in his residence. The small vase on the desk was bought by himself on foot in an antique shop.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Chairman's transportation, we didn't often see him walking long distances in Nanjing. Therefore, we always thought that he couldn't walk much due to his age and weakness. But that is not the case. Every time the Central Committee holds a general meeting or on the Premier's birthday when visiting the mausoleum, he also walks on foot. He can walk that long Zhongshan Road and those many stone steps in front of the mausoleum, and he can also walk down the stone steps and return to his official residence. After a short rest, he can return to his state before walking. On the surface, he is an elderly man, but in fact, he has the energy and leg strength of a young man.</p>
<p>Last year in Guangxi, he traveled around the Guilin landscape with General Li Zongren, General Bai Chongxi, General Huang Xuchu, and other senior officials. He also walked a lot, and the more he walked, the more excited he became. The beautiful scenery made him forget the fatigue in his legs. "Guilin's landscape is the best in the world, that's right!" He praised the landscape with a loud and strong voice from time to time, and walked on and on.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish him good health, a long life, and may he always happily manage the affairs of the country!</p>

<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>I recently saw an article in a newspaper about Mei Lanfang's happy event, mentioning Mei's wife, Fu Lingzhi, etc. This should be a mistake for Fu Zhifang. Zhifang is of banner origin and studied under the Qingyi Wu Lingxian. Initially, she was not well-known. When she performed at the Chengnan Amusement Park, she was squeezed out by Jin Shaomei and was quite unsuccessful. Therefore, some people created the example of opening private performances for her to earn a living. The fact that she became Mei Lanfang's wife was due to the efforts of celebrities such as Luo Yinggong and Feng Gengguang. Initially, after Zhifang was rejected by Chengnan, she thought about finding someone to spend her life with. At that time, Mei Lanfang often visited Chengnan and greatly admired Jin Shaomei's performance. For a time, there were rumors that Mei would marry Jin Shaomei. Zhifang heard this and quickly asked her teacher Wu Lingxian to speak to Mei. Wu was also Mei's teacher, and he discussed the matter with Feng and Luo. With the strong urging of Wu, Feng, and Luo, this marriage was successful. At that time, Yinggong also wrote a congratulatory couplet "Lan and Zhi Fragrant Together" with a short poem, which was widely praised in the capital. Earlier, Mei's wife, Wang, had some objections to Mei taking Fu as a concubine, but because Feng, Luo, and others were powerful, she could do nothing about it. Zhifang's appearance was ordinary, and her performance in the Hua Dan role was also mediocre. However, Lanfang was able to lower himself and treat the common as divine, while the intelligent and beautiful Meng Xiaodong was eventually divorced. This cannot be understood by ordinary people.</p>
<p>Sun Juxian often showed frustration and discontent in his later performances, probably due to his circumstances. Sometimes, he even expressed it in his lyrics. When Sun performed at Jixiang Garden in old Beijing, he openly talked about his patriotic views in his dialogues. The audience responded with boos, but Sun remained indifferent. Finally, he inserted the line "I am talking about patriotism to deaf ears" into his lyrics, which caused a stir. If it were not for the reputation of the "old fellow villagers," he would have been insulted. However, Sun was also one of the actors with a sense of integrity!</p>
<p>In the old days, Jianghu troupes would perform a "book" (a complete opera) in one day, divided into four sections: morning show, main show, continuation, and evening show, with the main show being the most important. There was a man named Zhang Gong in my hometown who seemed foolish but not foolish, and seemed crazy but not crazy. He loved drinking and watching plays. No matter how far or near the villages were performing, Zhang Gong could disrupt the troupe. He would write down all the actors and plays, what the morning show was, and what the main show was, in chalk on the streets and alleys as an introduction. He could also predict the performances in advance. At that time, there were no playbills to communicate theater news in the inland, but Zhang Gong's reports within thirty to fifty miles of the Jianghu troupe's footprints were always accurate. For a time, he was called the "living playbill." Now the Jianghu troupes have dispersed like fleeting clouds, and Zhang Gong's tomb has been around for more than ten years. Those who love plays must feel the changes of the past and present!</p>
<h3 id="e166">A Tale of the Pear Garden: Shang Xiaoyun Gifts the Famous Play to Wenqin <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yu</p>
<p>"The Daughter of Lanling" Performed by "The Daughter of Lanling"</p>
<p>In Shanghai, Jin Suqin is considered the best Kun Dan (female role), and her plays are considered the best. Zhang Wenqin is considered to have the most extensive knowledge of opera art. Suqin once studied under the old actor Wang Yaoqing, while Wenqin studied under Shang Xiaoyun. As for Mao Jianqiu, she used to promote herself as a "disciple of Mei," probably having studied under Huanhua. Wenqin's apprenticeship to Xiaoyun was on the Dragon Boat Festival in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936) when Xiaoyun came to Shanghai to perform for the birthday celebrations of Chen Yong'an and Zhang Xiaolin. The introducers were Wu Xiao'an, a famous amateur actor from Jinan, and Pan Yongyi from the transportation industry. People congratulated Wenqin on finding a famous teacher. When Xiaoyun returned north, Wenqin went to the station to see her off. Xiaoyun told her before parting, encouraging her to work hard in her art and said that after arriving in Peiping, she would send her a new private play as a gift, hoping she would take good care of it.</p>
<p>The complete new plays that Wenqin now performs, such as "Leifeng Pagoda," "Pearl Fan," "Longevity Mirror," and "Three Mothers Teach Their Son," were all obtained from Xiaoyun. Recently, Wu Xiao'an went from Shandong to Tianjin. He happened to meet Xiaoyun performing in Tianjin. During their happy meeting, he admired Xiaoyun's new play "The Daughter of Lanling." He said to Xiaoyun, "The 'Daughter of Lanling' you perform is a story about Lanling, and your female disciple Zhang Wenqin is also from Lanling—Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, formerly known as Nanlanling County. Why don't you give this play to her to perform on stage? Wouldn't that be a wonderful story in the Pear Garden?" Xiaoyun applauded and said it was a good idea. Yesterday, I met Zhang Wenqin and saw the outline of "The Daughter of Lanling." The plot tells the story of Ouyang Jingfan, a wealthy man from Lanling, whose daughter Shufang is beautiful and virtuous, known as the Daughter of Lanling. Ouyang and Bai Sheng's father are close friends. Bai studies at Ouyang's house and is classmates with Shufang. Ouyang promises to marry his daughter to him. After Bai's father dies, Ouyang disavows the engagement and promises her to a wealthy family because Bai is poor. Bai asks Zhang, a hunchbacked matchmaker, to propose marriage, but Ouyang refuses. Zhang offers a plan to elope. Bai initially refuses, but is persuaded by Zhang. Shufang is also angry at her father's reneging on the engagement and is persuaded by Zhang's sweet words. She gives Zhang a phoenix hairpin as a token. Each holds one branch, promising that after escaping, they must maintain proper conduct until Bai achieves fame and completes the marriage. Zhang's nephew, Luo Xi, is a rogue who pretends to be Bai to welcome Shufang. Shufang falls for his trick. On the way, he tries to take advantage of her. Just then, government patrols pass by. Luo pushes Shufang into a dry well and tries to escape, but is caught. Gradually, Shufang is rescued by Grandma Liu. Grandma Liu tells her nephew Liu Ren to retrieve the lost package. Liu goes with his friend Mo Long. Mo, seeing the money, kills Liu and pushes the body into the well. Ouyang, seeing his daughter elope at night, suspects that Bai lured her and sues him to the authorities. Magistrate Qin Gonglang is honest and upright. He questions Luo Xi and learns the whole story, knowing that Bai is innocent. He disguises himself as a fortune teller and visits privately. Shufang sees that Liu Ren has not returned with the package and asks Grandma Liu to investigate. She sits alone by the fence, lamenting her fate. Qin, disguised as a fortune teller, arrives. Shufang asks him to divine her past. At this time, Grandma Liu also returns, crying over the dead body. Qin learns the whole truth of the case. Later, he discovers that Mo Long killed Liu Ren based on the phoenix hairpin. He arrests and punishes Mo. Bai achieves fame. Qin presides over the marriage, and the young couple treat Grandma Liu well to repay her kindness for saving their lives. The whole play depicts the joys and sorrows of life, and is very vivid. Wenqin has obtained this excellent script and is reciting the lines. It will definitely be seen on stage in the future. The Daughter of Lanling" performed by "The Daughter of Lanling" is truly a wonderful story of the Pear Garden. Shang Xiaoyun and Zhang Wenqin</p>

<h3 id="e168">Appreciation of Dance (Middle) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Jiasheng</p>
<p>3.  Content and Posture of Dance</p>
<p>The posture of the dance changes with the content. Therefore, appreciating dance should compare its content with its posture. For example, the content of classical dance is religious worship, so you have to see if its posture is solemn, elegant, and simple. At the same time, you also need to connect the dance with the national characteristics from which it originated. For example, for German dance, is its line rough? Is the posture of French dance beautiful? Is English dance old-fashioned? And is Russian dance generous?</p>
<p>4.  Stage and Lighting</p>
<p>Lighting increases the special effect of stage dance. For example, when we look at the "Basda Harvest Dance," the yellow and red lights are used to express the facial expressions of the dancers, as if they are a group of farmers moving and laughing under the sun. Then, in addition to watching the dancers' postures, we also have to appreciate the mood of the lights they use. If a happy and lively dance is matched with dull lighting, then the effect of its posture will be reduced below the horizontal line.</p>
<p>5.  Dance and Musical Accompaniment</p>
<p>The steps of the dance completely depend on the push of the music rhythm, so music becomes an objective requirement of dance. Then, the interests of the music must adapt to the mood and background of the dance. Otherwise, not only will the dance effect be unsound, but it will also reduce the dancer's emotions. Therefore, the music arrangement of the dance should not only seek the harmony of the rhythm, but also make the interests of each other harmonious. And a dance should have music specially made for it, otherwise it will harm its effect. It is said that a few years ago, at the ballroom of the Beijing Six Nations Hotel, the music arranged for a Chinese female dancer's "Greek Goddess Dance" and a male dancer's "Spanish Knight Dance" completely deviated from the original dance's interest, and I know this music. Because this music is not dance music, but modern pure music, using pure music to arrange the postures and movements of "Knight" and "Goddess" is tantamount to not recognizing the connectivity of music and dance. Therefore, in addition to appreciating the dance itself, we also need to examine the music arrangement.</p>
<p>6.  Dance Movements</p>
<p>The lines of dance movements are also determined by its content. In the 16th and 17th centuries, people paid attention to form, so the lines of classical dance also focused on the formal beauty of small postures, the so-called fine line dance. At the same time, various dances of this era were created from the basic principles of common steps. The 18th century advocated the development of human personality, so the lines of romantic dance tried to individualize it as much as possible, and the movements were more free. In the 19th century, dance was influenced by impressionism, so its movements sought to blur the lines. As for modern times, because of the demand for the expression of power, the lines and postures of dance focus on the large movements of the outline, the so-called three-dimensional rough line dance, and collective dance is used as a unit. Therefore, it can be seen that the appreciation of dance should be compared with its content.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Lord Donggao Excels at the Art of Changing Faces</p>
<p>In addition, there is another difficulty, which is singing. The singing, percussion, and stringed instruments must all be in sync. If one of the three is slightly faster or slower, then they will clash. (Singing actors are most afraid of clashing with the background music; if they clash, they will surely go off-key). The above discussion only concerns the singing part. When it comes to expression, it is even more difficult. Because Wu Zixu has great hatred for his parents and brothers, but in this opera, there is no individual or object to vent it on. Therefore, all the acting techniques such as blowing one's beard and staring eyes cannot be used. Expressions without an object in the play are the most difficult to perform. Initially, Wang Guifen was good at having two large eyes. He could completely express his full of anger between his eyebrows and eyes. No wonder this play was his masterpiece.</p>
<p>The most feared thing in opera is a dead face, "no eyes." A dead face means that regardless of joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, grief, fear, surprise, or worry, it is all that one face. "No eyes" means that the eyes are naturally small and cannot convey the spirit. Although there are two eyes, they are simply useless on stage. This is called "no eyes," and it is not the same as a blind person who cannot see anything at all. If that were really the case, how could they perform on stage? In the past, old Tan suffered from having small eyes and lacking ferocity. Fortunately, his face had acting skills, so it was not a big problem. However, he knew how to hide his shortcomings. Therefore, he never performed "Zhaoguan." Now, except for Ju Peng, other old Tan school actors do not perform it much, also because there is no way to follow it.</p>
<p>Most people think that Wu Zixu's beard turned white due to sorrow in "Wen Zhaoguan." Even I have asked several knowledgeable celebrities, and they all agree. One year, I met an old opera lover. During the banquet, he suddenly raised this question, and everyone at the table was stumped. Finally, he expressed his high opinion: "According to me, Zixu's beard was turned white by Lord Donggao using the art of changing faces. Look at Lord Donggao's introduction; he said that he was a disciple of Bian Que in his youth. When he saw Zixu, Fu mentioned his esteemed teacher, but he never mentioned what position he held in the court in the past. This shows how much Lord Gao valued his teacher. Bian Que was a famous doctor in ancient times, truly capable of bringing the dead back to life. Gao respected his teacher so much, so his medical skills can be imagined. He kept Zixu in the back garden and did not meet him for seven days, but he added aging drugs to his diet and spied on Zixu's appearance through the window at night to see if it had changed. Zixu originally had great hatred in his heart, so he was naturally frowning. Lord Gao's medicine worked, and with Zixu's anxiety and worry, the two combined to attack, so he was able to turn his beard and hair completely white in a short period of seven days. Although the opera lyrics do not explicitly mention Lord Gao's prescription, those who listen to the Chu opera cannot but carefully ponder it. The ancients often liked to keep secrets and play dumb riddles when writing books and operas. Who knows if the person who wrote this play was playing a dumb riddle for future generations to guess?" Because I thought what this opera fan said made a lot of sense, I announced Lord Gao's magical art."</p>
