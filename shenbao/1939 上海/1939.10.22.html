<p>社評</p>
<h3>逆倫案部視</h3>
<p>轟動上海社會的周氏兩兄弟逆倫弒父巨案，隔昨已經特一法院宣判了。這確是一個罕見的刑事案件，因爲性質非常嚴重，轟動了整個的上海社會；而且在現社會中，誰都脫不了倫常關係，因此誰都對於這倫常巨變的事件發生了深切的注意，所以我們也應該提出來檢討一下。</p>
<p>當司法程序已在進行還沒有宣判的時候，輿論界對於這事應該暫守緘默，以免妨害了司法獨立的精神；現在雖已宣判，但是我們所要檢討的却也不在法律問題範圍以內。因爲國有常典，只要證據確鑿，犯罪者當然無所逃遁。即使犯罪者企圖把動機來掩飾惡行，但是悖謬殘酷，絕無理由可以辯護其惡行；莫謂彼甘心自居於社會人羣之外，亦社會人羣所絕對不容此類罪惡。况且目前正在民族抗戰的時期中間，靑年人忘記了自身的地位，斤於家庭問題，演出這種違反中華民族精神的大罪行，這允其表示了他們國家意識的喪失，所以這種人該受國法最嚴厲的制裁，實在是毫無疑義的。現在我們更需要在法律問題以外，一論社會上爲什麼會發生這種案件？這種案件發生後對於社會上會發生什麼影響？社會上應該怎樣補救，以免這種事件的再現？</p>
<p>這種案件的發生，當然就表示着社會上有一種缺陷；換句話說，就是社會秩序不能保持和諧的形態，社會秩序的所以不能保持和諧，就因爲時代關係已促進了社會制度的崩潰，而一般人不能在這動盪的社會中把握住對事物的正確觀點，以致發生了這樣違反常情的舉動，所以社會制度一日不能獲得安定點走上一個軌道的時候，類此的案件就不免發生，不過也許沒有像本案這樣的殘酷罷了。</p>
<p>這種案件發生以後，社會上當然會感受到不良的影饗。但這決不是說以後必然會繼續發生同樣的摹仿事件；不過在社會心理上，一定會流行着普遍的不安狀態，就是大家因此案而發生許多懷疑，例如，一般人也許會懷疑到中華民族一向很注重的倫理以後是吾可能繼續地保持下去？或者因爲本案兩逆子都是受過學校敎育的靑年，因此又懷疑到國家重要設施的敎育是吾已經宣告了破產？或者更因爲本案犯罪的方法是應用電流的，於是就懷疑到科學是吾即罪惡的淵藪？科學越發達，社會上的罪惡是吾越會增加？</p>
<p>其實上述的幾種懷疑，根本都是多餘的。第一，倫理關係在家庭制度一日沒有消滅以前，當然一日不會廢除。一則中國社會的倫理很講求對等的，例如忠孝與仁愛相提並論，這就表示了因時代的進展而倫理觀念很有修正的傾向。再則中國的法律對於倫理觀念也相當地尊重，所以倫理在本身觀念的修正以及法律保障的兩重關係之下，決不會不能繼續保持。第二，敎育固然對靑年的行爲應該負相當的責任，但是學校敎育祇佔敎育的一部門。周子弒父固然不能遽歸咎於學校敎育；但學校薰陶的無力，不能導之於善，確也是事實。所以今後的問題祇在於敎育的力量應如何加强，決不須根本懷疑到敎育的無效。第三，科學的本身無所謂功罪，祗看人類的如何把它應用；如果社會的缺陷有了適當糾正的途徑，那末科學的發展還是在軌道上的。</p>
<p>總之，社會發生了缺陷，以致一部分人失去了理性，不能把握住對事物的正確觀點，這才是問題的癥結。</p>
<p>怎樣免除這種慘酷案件的再現，根本關鍵當然還是社會制度的改造，暫時的治標辦法，必須一方面加强法律的力量，另一方面加强敎育的作用。目前的敎育當然不能算是健全，但所謂不健全徵象之一，就是對於一切向來認爲難談的問題，往往置之不論不議之列。例如倫理的問題，究竟應該如何去把握，敎育者往往避免檢討，以致是非順逆之節，缺乏相當的認識，這也許是間接助長罪惡的根本原因，很値得敎育家猛省的此外還有一點，即社會上最近很可能把逆倫弒父案件作爲談笑的資料，而且一定有人編作小說音樂甚至戲劇電影等材料，吾們相信一定會採取勸善懲惡的形式；但我們應知道敎育原則上有一條，就是把惡例示人反足以引起作惡的動機，所以公園裏與其寫「不可採花」，不如敎大家「愛護花木」；同樣的把一種社會罪惡繪影繪聲地刻劃描摹出來，究竟有什麼效力，也很値得疑問的。這一點我們也不能不相當地注意。</p>

<p>重慶　據今日此間官方人士稱、美國駐日大使格魯、在東京所發之言論無非表示美國對於中國具有歷史的友誼、同時亦所以表示美國對遠東權益之堅决態度、更所以表示美國對侵略行爲之感覺及其不承認以武力征服土地之决心、且去年十二月三十一日、美國曾致牒日本、但日本迄未予以答覆、後因日美關係之日趨對立、故美政府始將美日商的予以廢止、格魯大使今决之演辭、不過爲重申美國所致日本各種牒文中所已開之立塲、又此間各報、對於格魯大使之言論、莫不冠以大字之標題、並附以冗長之評論、據中央日報稱、格魯之演辭、具有兩重意義、在積極方面、重申美國不承認以武力侵佔土地之立塲、在消極方面、在駁斥日本各種侵略理論如「東亞新秩序」之類、同時格魯已明告日本之宣傳家、即世人非易欺、彼等種種淆惑聽聞之宜傳、業已歸於全部失敗、該報末稱、自中日戰爭發生以來、美國之態度、至今僅作口頭與書面之聲明、今世界所希冀而期待者、即爲美國之行動、今美國對於實際行動、巳有凖備、實令中國人民發生無上之敬佩、至於大公報則認之爲「太平洋光明時期之到來、」其言曰、美國業巳充分認識遠東之眞相、决計不再帮兇、而欲予元兇以懲戒矣、按日本帝國主義者之經濟命脈、完全操於美國之手、故由美國以制裁日本、實易如反掌、換言之、美國祇須不與日本續訂新商的、停止與日本貿易、允其軍火貿易、則即可制日本之死命、除此而外、若更能對華繼續借款、則即能促使遠東和平與秩序之早日恢復、中國共產黨機關報新華日報稱、格魯之演辭、對於艱苦抗戰之中國人、無異一大興奮劑、同時亦爲對於「遠東慕尼黑專家之當頭一棒、再則對於帮助日人欺騙中國人一塊樹立「東亞新秩序」之汪精衛、無異爲一晴天霹靂、中國陸軍機關掃蕩報稱、格魯之演辭、使我人抗戰到底之决心、越加增强、允使我人對於「最後勝利必屬於我」之信仰、爲之堅定、我人雖已擬定純以自力獲取勝利之政策、但外國對於我人之同情與精神援助、我人亦認爲具有極大之力量、時事新報稱、格魯之演辭、實爲日人之一大打擊、爲掃除「東亞新秩序」之氣氛計、我人希望美國以極大之决心與堅强之行動、以支持九國公的、蓋九國公的與東亞新秩序、」兩者固不能並存也、（一十一日美聯電社）</p>

<h3>歐戰爆發前　愛拉立三國的局勢</h3>
<p>— 倫敦泰晤士報伯明譯</p>
<p>本篇述愛托尼亞·拉特維亞·立陶宛·三國的局勢很詳、但寫在德國侵路波蘭以前、故其言論已和今日大局不符、自蘇德瓜分波蘭以後、三國迫於蘇聯的威力、和蘇聯締結各種條的、犧牲了許多重大利益、易得本國的一時安全、她們豫謀的計畫、全不能實施、國際大局變化的迅速、在本年可稱是曠古未有、而最遭殃的、便是諸小國、現在蘇芬的談判、又在進行了、正不知其結果如何、然而可以豫決的、小國總要吃些虧、而作重耍讓步、才能免遭浩刧哩、即如斯堪的那維亞半島的諸國、和瑞士·荷蘭·比利時、現在也都惴惴不安、深恐德國破壞她們的中立假道進兵、攻擊英法軍、總之、國際間信義兩字、已完全消滅、不說小國、連大國也不能安枕了、</p>
<p>譯者</p>
<p>拉特維亞和愛托尼亞與德國簽訂互不侵犯協定、而對德獲得有益的妥協、德政府先欲對兩國分別締結雙方協定、但終同意兩協定內容應相同、而在同時簽字、所以此兩波羅的海國家已予德國以兩件新的雙方協定、而本身並不背離其所遵守的、在世界上處於獨立狀况、而團結一致的原則、</p>
<p>拉愛兩國在二十年前俄國分裂時、一同誕生、爲生存的權利而並肩作戰、最早時期、兩國軍隊常奇異地混雜一起、愛人在拉境作戰、拉國的現任外長便是一度在愛軍中對抗共同敵人的拉人之一、</p>
<p>此兩孿生的共和國、以愛國稍長、一九一八年五月三日英國承認愛國事實上的存在、同年十一月對拉國也如此、然而其後兩年中、兩國繼續混和着作戰、一會對抗進侵的紅軍、一會又對抗舊德軍的殘衆、——因爲德人已佔據了波羅的海諸國的大部份、而德廢皇還親臨里加哩、</p>
<p>蘇聯在一九二〇年二月二日和八月十一日、與愛拉兩國先後簽訂和平條的、除白萊斯特里托夫斯克和的而外、這是蘇聯政府的第一决和的、他們一向保留着關係的基礎、當時正式承認的獨立和邊界、從未遭威脅、內部共黨份子的幾决革命企圖、也不費事地使之失敗、一九三〇年後的最初幾年、兩國對於國會制、漸起厭倦、當時的國會操諸許多黨派的無經騐領袖之手、已失其初旨、而演成不斷爭辯的不健全的集中點、這植爭辯、不但使政局失却穩定和目的的專一、甚至起嚴重的內部爭鬥、國家遭其威脅、於是兩國原先爭取獨立時的諸領袖、斷然再起領導、經過幾年的竭力改組和革新、產生了自己的立法和行政制度、在此兩共和國間旣彼此相異、在許多方面、與他國的制度也不同、然而含有國會選舉、還稍有溫和的獨裁性質、</p>
<p>拉愛兩國、普世似無仇敵、他們自身當然也非任何國的仇人、所關切的、不過是發展自己的些微天然富源、派出漁舟和商船往公海、並促進與鄰國間的和平交往、最後述及的一點、最爲重要、是兩國存在的必要條件、</p>
<p>一般人稱愛拉兩國居歐洲和平的軸心上、與波蘭和羅馬尼亞形成德國和蘇聯之間的障碍物、此點是波羅的海的政治家永遠不忘的、常據此而定外交政策、對蘇聯和德國保有良好的鄰國關係、而不予仟何一方以勢必惱及他人的任何利益、即使在早年、當德國距離波羅的海諾國似較今日爲遠的時候、兩國也未予蘇聯以專有利益、雖曾實試樹立更密切的經濟關係、但從未考慮到政治糾葛、去年、兩國宣佈嚴守中立、這在戰時將給他們以一個微小的機會、兩國從未嚴重考慮自動的參加德方、因爲此舉將促使蘇聯軍隊向波羅的海海岸進發、波羅的海諾國必成戰塲、而被摧毀、不論戰事前途如何、若果參加蘇方、就等於准許蘇軍協助海岸綫的防務、而冒有價値的海口如達林·里加·汶决畢爾斯·和里派迦、被蘇聯併呑之險然而當德國建　締結互不侵犯協定時、兩國很少或毫不遲疑、因爲此兩協定有若干保護的價値、而不能有何損害、是理所當然的、若加拒絕、勢必惹起德國指摘其偏袒蘇聯、兩國和蘇聯業已訂結性質相類的幾種協定、而這另和德國締結的協定、至少在理論上說、是中立的另一保障、　（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　英美匯愈益放長　港帮不斷塞出　滙豐進胃轉淡</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市情勢、處多日鬆懈之姿態下、鬆勢有增無减、咸認英金五辨士、美匯八元大關、不難擊破於最近也、當日經過、晨初與隔昨相仿、嗣因港帮本其一貫作風、首來猛塞、祇匯豐與有利小數買入、故此時已略告鬆、俄頃港帮續吐、而匯豐忽扳價吸收、致鬆勢更厲、英金已達四辨士六八七五、美匯爲七元八一二五、詎料此後賣者頓裏足不前、一度平靜這至十一時半、港帮又出、而匯豐竟亦束手停購、市象不支、中途雖華比有利略扒、然尚有兩外行相與吐出、故最硬一度美匯爲七元八七五、結果英金更硬、爲四辨士七〇三一二五、而美匯亦告七元八四三七五收盤、至期貨交易、雖有做開、惟趨勢則一、半天交易尚旺、</p>
<p>美商昨亦有賣出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近期長三一二五、遠期升一二五、紐約銀價未更、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法等各匯俱平、美對英·對滬亦均無升降、對法小二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辨士六〇九三七五、美匯七元七一八七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後港電首來塞出、但滙豐雖有吃胃、然已不若上日之健、故而趨勢帶硬、計港電售予匯豐有利現貨英金四辨士六二五及六五六二五、同時出口商亦吐予某行大通現貨美匯七元七五、少頃某行賣予同行十一月份美匯七元六二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉小二分、此後港電續來塞予匯豐現貨英金四辨士六八七五、繼而港電與大通某行賣予華比有利現貨美匯七元八一二五、是以過程步硬、此後對於以上價一度無人賣出、潛勢略形平定、但至十一時半後、港電復來吐出、且其時匯豐鮮少吃胃、致爲狀愈鬆、計港電售予外行現貨英金四辨士七〇三一二五、並現貨美匯七元八四三七五與八七五、繼之華商吐予某行十月美匯七元七五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辨士七〇三一二五、美匯七元八叫三七五、本月份與現貨相同、十一月份英金四辨士六四〇六二五、美匯七元七一八七五、結果比隔昨現期英均鬆〇九三七五、美俱硬一二五、半日交易頗旺、除美商外、其他各行均有軋進、華商錢兌業對於美金稍有吸胃、下午週六無市、</p>
<p>香港滙市殊平穩</p>
<p>香港二十一日電、今晨匯市開盤平穩、英美日各匯不動、申匯現貨降二元、爲三百二十元、半日間平靜無變化、</p>
<p>天津美滙出七元</p>
<p>天津二十一日電、今日匯市晨開續見放長、英匯現貨鬆一二五、爲四辨士二五、美匯現貨長二五、爲七元一八七五、申匯續降二元半、爲一百零八元、「聯鈔」喑盤賤一元、爲八十七元、</p>
<h3>出多進少　金市猛落　破四千元大關</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况，風平三日惟外匯步鬆四千元大關已不堪一擊、最低價曾現三千九白六十五元開盤、爲四千元尚屬常日最高價、嗣以各帮大　傾塞、即告三千九白九十五元、惟港帮及某金號搜買尚力、跌勢遂遏、被拉起四元、但此後以港帮買意中止、因港輪啟椗、暫緩收進、再以週杪之故、頭寸倍形充裕、而外匯鬆勢難息、故進少出多、愈盤愈落、達三千九百六十六元收盤、午後週六無市、而塲外則稍有做開、價爲三千九百七十元左右、半天交易的六百兩光景、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌三十九元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開外匯鬆硬、市勢虛疲、開市即做小五元、錢兌業賣予銀樓帮二十兩、爲四千元、繼父降落五元、錢兌業互做十兩、爲三千九百九十五元、時港帮吸收百兩光景、且金號亦來拉提、但其時各帮供意頗佳、故你高四元、某銀樓進現余號三十兩、價爲三千九百九十九元、此後聞外匯續趨硬化、賣風更濃、銀樓帮粉來爭先塞出、加之某金號亦反進爲出、且港帮中止收買故市象缺乏維持、步向下瀉、不外　小二十二元、銀樓帮賣予錢兌業二十兩、爲三千九百七十七元、嗣後一度稍定、金號進錢兌業十兩、爲三千九百八十元、十一時半光景、因外匯再度報硬、致重引起賣風、錢兌業頻來拋塞、竟又做低十五元、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲三千九百六十五元、後錢兌業復進銀樓帮二十兩、爲三千九百六十六元作午收價、結果比隔昨軋跌三十九元、半天三十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、收進須减低，二十元光景、現標金照掛牌金低五十元左右、</p>
<p>飾金改掛四百元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百〇五元、迨至正午掛小五元、此後則無變化、計大同行改懸四百元、新同行與上價相同、收進减小二十元、至十五元不一、</p>
<h3>外幣日下　美金票進　十三元關</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市面、每况愈下、蓋旣因外匯經港電力塞而步鬆、又因金價突然跌入四千元關、兼之時現時隱之和平空氣忽又囂　上、以致人心更不易轉好、昨市結果、計英金鎊跌七角、美金鎊降二元、英金票低二角、美金票落一角三分、香港票小五分半、新加坡票降一角生、荷蘭票跌二角、安南票落八分、菲列濱票降二角、日余票小厘、朝鮮票跌一分、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債後市　冉冉上騰</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、晨市趨勢雖疲、但以多方之收買抬價、故後市開盤、即有一般跟進、價遂抬高四五角、昨日經過、上午見疲、不脫盤旋狀態、收市時稍見穩定、後市因暗中價已抬高、市價乃冉冉上騰、所謂和平空氣、又乘機而起、檯面狹窄、多方抬價雖難、跌價亦因之不易、計一日結果、竟繼續抬高三四角、獨九六小一角五分、成交總數的七八十萬兀之譜、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交中國銀持股四十股、價為五十四元二角半、</p>
<p>衆業公所中西股票市况、價格漲落不一、交易因週末關係稍形淸稀、最近上漲甚烈之德律風股、一度由十九元回小十七元三角、最後價爲十八元二角、怡和紗股亦稍疲落、中國墾殖與國際信托則統稍上漲、其他各股無甚變化、橡皮股因電訊萎靡及浮多了結有多種略形下疲、</p>
<p>倫教二十日電、今日英商速東各公司股票掛牌行市、銀行股與橡皮股升降互見、麥加利銀行股升二先令六便士、爲七鎊五先令、匯豐銀行股各降一鎊、英倫註冊股爲七十四鎊、倫敦註冊股爲七十五鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股回升五便士、價爲十六先令、其餘平平、</p>
<p>倫敦二十日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍告平靜、上下檔各債券、均無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　十支粗紗　續跌十元</h3>
<p>連跌一週之紗市、昨趨勢稍見穩定、蓋有一部份投機商認爲已跌至六百五十元之價不妨買淮幾包、做做輸贏、如果再墮、再進再扯、一旦得機反動、即可不虧本、市傳某君將外匯賣去、掉淮棉紗、又一說錢莊帮亦來投機、收購幾包、就此一鼓虛風、暫行抑止、但客帮心思依然沉悶、而船隻停駛不航、故各帮交易仍抱觀望態度、但市塲形勢略好、收盤以後續升、不過步步下落允巨、此種回風亦在情理之中也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、人氣仍　、交易甚稀、一般專門搶風頭之戶、視情况散漫、無機可乘、在市吃荳腐亂吵、迨至十時才做開市盤、再跌十一元、雙馬價爲六百五十八元、少頃再下三元、但中身二十支紗雙地球。天女市况尚平、中途買風稍起、謂某某等來搜進、市象回升、收盤價爲六百六十五元、棧單價爲六百五十四元、查半日成交統計一千一百五十五包、行情二十支豐馬跌七元、天女漲一元、雙地球勿動、惟十支粗紗跌十元、今日有紗二十件遝暹羅、五十五件運杳港、一百件運厦鬥、茲將各帮口買去額量列左、同行　一、二　香港　一〇內地　六〇　寗波　二〇福州　二〇　江西　三〇統計一、二五五</p>
<h3>棉價步跌</h3>
<p>本棉交易略形淮展、但華廠納胃依然閉塞、惟日廠稍有需耍、略爲點綴而巳、故市態異常軟弱、實則紗市不靈、以致唇齒相依之原棉、牽入漩渦之中、因之售價比上日疲短一二元之譜、蘇北來源仍旺、到通花二千五百六十包、又北沙來三白七十包、今日有一一十包遝厦門、五百九十包運香港、茲將　棉情形列左、通州　一三四·〇〇　同業　三〇〇包又　一四二·〇〇　上海　五〇〇包嘉定　一四〇·〇〇　又　二〇〇包通州　一三二·〇〇　同業　二〇〇包火機　一二四·〇〇　又　二〇〇包</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來殊爲呆滯、各方以紗價之未能振作、故概抱觀望態度、即靑島帮對於原棉之採購、亦趨靜寂、廠方所希冀者、祇望紗銷能有起色、同業手中原棉存貨尚有數十件、惟俱係高價時所購藏、故對目前之價格、不願出售、總合各方觀測、本月已屬無望、須待下月紗銷有轉機之望歟、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因海外商之購買而激漲、國內廠方亦因布疋暢銷、進胃殊健、後因孟買來電報跌、市况頓形轉疲、南方帮亦趕來套賣、同業間亦有拋賣、故收盤頗爲疲乏、結果棉價較咋日行市跌落八至十磅音不等、印度連同預測、又跌三羅比餘、埃及無甚軒輊、利物浦略漲二便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　到稀與操縱　米價又漲</h3>
<p>米市似呈盤旋之勢、蓋目日前因到旺一度回跌後、昨則復以天時陰寒、及到稀等故、人心再堅、初開喊聲即高、兼之本鄉店胃栗六、並有內地帮趁檔吸收、一般客家、扳持極力、價格迭見飛升、若窰種與百哥全市祇抵一車、數僅一百二三十包、奇貨可居、更覺出色、在相互競購、行情迭增之際、霎時即告罄、收盤三十一元三角至三十一元、比前市又回升一二元之巨、其决新粳市貨較多、然以跌透之餘、價盤似廉、且一經天時陰寒、身骨即能轉堅、較可守持、所以客販售意不鬆、結果亦提半元至近元、破　及陳新變元、去路仍不廣、然在各貨漲風檔口、價亦帶起半元不等、蘆羊尖亦然相同、至於客尖雖聞某洋行續有推出、但市面自前午一度回緊、人心都屬看好、緣此零躉銷塲晨千兩市俱頗活絡、各價繼升半元、迨至午時、貨主以爲不能再漲、紛紛出晚、致貨充塞、市反呆木、方始看小矣、全日成交七八千包、</p>
<p>另訊客秈昨因江北等各路來源均見寥落、而日商所辦到之皖秈亦無隻包售出、店囤內地鄕莊雜戶則以連日價跌、已經引起辦意、市面頓形緊張氣象、惟交易早市一度活潑後、午晚已嫌　觀望、市乃挺而復平、惟上午成交者午後並無退盤、行情仍扯漲半元左右云、</p>
<h3>麪粉囤戶吐售</h3>
<p>轉棧貨與廠盤相埒</p>
<p>麵粉　昨日交易平淡、因値週末、連日廠家不願多售、市上圓籠貨供源亦感缺乏、所以客胃反覺呆懈、市面擯持、一般零星囤戶見勢不佳、均有吐售之意、聞轉棧貨已與廠盤相埒、比前見鬆角許、惟洋粉因存到兩乏、仍須八元一二角、統市成交併計不足三萬包、市面變化且待下週初、麵粉今日有五千包運往香港、</p>
<p>小麥　日昨來源依然不多、貨方售意向不鬆賤、而廠胃終嫌價昂、觀望小前、結果交易寥落、統市僅售開無錫小麥四百包、十元〇三角三分、蘇州小麥三車、十元〇六角半、悉由粉廠辦去、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日絲漲風加厲　本市交易轉淸</h3>
<p>國外絲市橫濱漲風仍烈、現貨晨盤一八六〇元、漲六十元、下午收盤一九〇〇元、又漲四十元、遠期一八一〇元、下午收盤一八五八元、紐約絲價雖挫、現貨未動、近期跌六分、遠期小七分、上海絲市因亦相當轉疲、白廠七八分四七〇〇元、輯里經二三〇〇元、雖有成交、但洋行去胃巳不濃厚、購者情緒似已轉苛、故下午絲市喑盤趨跌、蓋若如高價已不可多得、一般囤貨者、更不欲失去此出籠良機也、昨計成交一百十担云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋慘瀉　囤貨源源出籠　同業稍有搜羅</h3>
<p>國布　昨棉布本街及溫州帮交易漸顯活潑、乃緣滬溫棧日內有恢復通航希望、客戶入手購辦、兼以市面積疲日久囤戶出籠每創驚人低價、一部份同業乘廉落手、惟布價因東疋跌勢太凶、賣買雙方有相持不下之勢、小額國貨售出價仍一致傾跌、市盤極度混亂、白貨跌五分至五角、色布色斜跌三五角、雜牌籃布即按市廉一元以外、尚無人問津、春銷淺色漂白細紗貨較爲穩定、本街同業收購粗布細布細斜絨布漂白印花貨五百餘件、溫甬帮辦怡和粗布色布色斜二百餘件、粵帮辦細布細斜粗布絨布等貨一百餘件南洋及香港帮亦辦近二百件、</p>
<p>東疋　市氣蕭條、新低價迭創、晨市龍頭細布降至（每疋）十八元六角、四君子嗶嘰慘落至六角〇二厘半、後市以跌勢過猛、日商洋行收進龍頭一百數十包、本街多頭心思之同業亦復乘廉搜羅、細布成交三百餘包、嗶嘰成交四五百箱、售盤乃稍稍挺、龍頭現貨升至十八元七角半、嗶嘰喊盤每碼六角〇五厘至七厘半、四君子直貢貨底較薄、大都不肯鬆售、市盤爲六角分半、</p>
<p>出口　今日有疋頭二百十五件運香港、　百二十五件運厦門、一百件運土樂、一百五十五件運暹邏、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖又小一二元</h3>
<p>昨糖市據外電均乏更動、本市公會劃盤趨勢仍疲、囤戶且有脫售、跌風米已、本棧二四粗白五十五元、小二元半、外棧五十六元至五十六元八角、小二元至一元二角、轉口貨四十五元、小一元、太古車白小二元至一元半、B嘜爲五十九元半至六十元、GW嘜五十九元半、GX嘜五十九元、DJ嘜五十七元半、HX嘜五十七元、H嘜車赤四十二元半、荷赤四十三元半、均小一元、本綿白振記一號五——七元、號五十六元半　三號五十六元、四號五十五元五角、本　號冰六十八元半、晶明冰七十元、均小元半、國糖疲象、仍無續開、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球節節下降　小廠貨又跌兩元</h3>
<p>煤球行情、自原料鴻基　湧到後、即行回鬆、由八十四允頂盤、回至七十穴元、及六十八元、節節下降、而店家生意、因月前用戶防荒囤足、反無去胃、允其如小廠貨、更形呆滯、以是日前暗盤又跌兩元、但大廠如南洋·義泰興·仍守原價、同業送到、每噸七十元零五角、客戶零售、每担三元八角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　圓肉桂圓　新盤已開</h3>
<p>首批同安新桂圓、昨曾開盤大粒、比陳貨加起二十餘兀、尚未成盤、新生晒元肉開一百五十二三元、廉州新元肉一百七十五元、</p>
<h3>五金　美條鐵漸入疲途　白鉛皮客銷稍動</h3>
<p>美條鐵　近日市况、重入疲途、蓋是貨之唯一依賴者、係本街製罐廠·及玩具廠等、但最近該數廠均無進辦之意、因之銷塲大受打擊、刻市買賣祇一般小廠家及門市零星買戶、因之開價稍退、刻市每箱沽一百十元、（係統花色）、但單吊之大尺寸、則每箱喊價仍須一百十七八元至一百二十餘元不等、</p>
<p>白鉛皮　昨交易忽見蓬勃、市上之問津者十分踴躍、由福州帮辦去三十桶、天津烟臺靑島諸帮亦搜去有近百桶光景、因之市象熱鬧、標準如薄花色每桶沽八百元、中檔貨每桶開七百六七十元、厚花色每桶則須八百元外、</p>
<h3>雜糧　大宗油豆運華南</h3>
<p>今（二十二日）有大量雜糧汕豆運往香港、計有高粱四百三十包、生仁一千二百三十包、花生五百包、豆子了二千三百七十包、生油一千二百四十五聽、芝蔴三百五十包·蔴油五百聽、另有豆子三百八十包、豆油五百九十聽、則運往廈門、運往暹羅者、祇豆餅一千塊、</p>

<h3>美國表示堅強政策　上海局勢頓改觀　赫爾言論所播人心振奮　租界當局態度轉趨積極　傳下週直接談判</h3>
<p>上海租界地位、過去已備受日方之威脅進迫、自歐戰發生後、日方復支持偽警越界侵權在滬西區域、公然設立僞警署、派僞警武裝游行、侵佔巡捕崗位、指揮暴徒、歷决刦奪巡捕槍械、詛愈演愈烈、前晚六時五十分、竟有計劃的襲擊巡捕、致華印巡捕、一死一傷、殊使與租界利益有關之各國　引起極度之不安、遂不得不採取堅決行動、以維護中外人民之生命財產聞英兵昨日已出防越界築路區域、領團已放棄對日僞方面之妥協政策、另行考慮强硬步驟、美國政府巳表示援助工部局採取適當行動、因之滬上人心大慰、預料由於日僞所製造之種種不法行爲、或將引起一嚴重後果、茲分誌昨日所得詳情於後、</p>
<h3>赫爾表示　通力合作</h3>
<p>美聯社特派昌威爾遜華盛頓二十一日電、國務卿赫爾、昨晚宣布美國政府擬與上海工部局通力合作、解決各種事變、如昨晚在上海越界築路區、暴徒武裝攻擊工部局巡捕事、赫爾聲稱、工部局當決定應取何項行動、以解決事變、駐滬美國官員極端注視該項事變、並『通力合作以解決之』、觀察家視赫爾云『通力合作』、乃表示美國準備應工部局之請求武裝保護越界築路內美國人民生命財產、最近該區日人管理下之『大道』警察侵入、赫爾文告、係重申美國政府贊助上海工部局努力保護越界築路一帶之權益及利益、及抵抗日方施用壓力以改變上海公共租界地位、</p>
<h3>美國採取　強硬政策</h3>
<p>但消息靈通人士方面聲稱、國務院迄今尚未接得美國人民因『大道』警察侵入越界築路危及生命財產、而請求政府作干涉之舉、消息靈通人士、視上海工部局總董樊克令發表擬請美國海軍陸戰隊保護被『大道」警察侵入之上海越界築路區內美國人民生命財產之警告係美國在遠凍採取更强硬態度之另一表示、華盛頓觀察家以樊克令氏之文告、與美國駐日大使格魯、本星期在東京所作坦白演說、作一比較、</p>
<h3>樊克令之　堅強態度</h3>
<p>格魯告日人謂美國人民明瞭「東亞新秩序、」猶如日本人民、但美國人民反對之、因此項措置、似褫奪美國人民在遠東之權益及利益也、樊克令之文告、於未曾辨認暴徒槍殺上海越界築路區工部局華捕一人及重傷印捕一人後發表之、樊氏聲稱、倘寓居越界築路之美國人民需要保護時、渠將請求美國政府予以該項保護、樊氏聲稱、「就余僩人而言、我人不能拋棄寓居越界築路區域內應受工部局保護之外國橋民而不顧、」</p>
<p>竭力援助　滬工部局</p>
<p>此間觀察家指出樊克令之文告、爲自中日戰事爆發以來工部局職員公開表示最堅決態度之一人、一部份人士、以爲樊克令此種堅決表示、可決之美國政府對上海越界築路之稅收與警權問題、必予上海工部局以援助美國在遠東之外交行動、於歐洲戰事發生以後、已呈露强硬之態、一部份人以爲美國之所以採取强硬態度、一方係因保護其本身在華之權利、一方亦係因英法在歐作戰、無暇顧及遠東之故、歐戰發生以後、美國對亞洲艦隊於菲律濱之防務、皆已增强、親察家意謂美國遠東政策、並未變更、但現已採取較堅決之行動、</p>
<h3>下週舉行　直接談判</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（二十一日）記者訪晤工部局與上海特別市府主要官員後、今料雙方似將於下週內舉行直接談判、以解决兩當局間種種爭端、允以久懸之界外馬路問題爲然、雖雙方於本年三月二十三舉行初步非正式討論後、至今仍陷僵局、惟記者仍抱雙方似將直接談判之見解、查三月二十三日討論、係市長傳筱庵與工部局前總裁費信停在百老滙大厦舉行者、直至上月初、工部局總裁費利浦、始與傳筱庵在</p>

<p>會談、而陷於新僵局、惟據上星期一日宣佈工部局已申請領事團調停此事、結果、商諸本市日領署當局、請予協助、聞多經日當局之幹旋、今乃有早日解决雙方問題之希望、同時聞諸可恃方面、特別市府或將於數日內</p>
<p>擬具建議</p>
<p>提交領事團、內將耍求以西區華當局完全管理爲基礎、而收回界外馬路、而市府則將償還公共租界在該區建路。修理。與特別建築等所耗一切經費、此外、對於自來水·電話·與電力公司等在該區</p>
<p>所耗經費</p>
<p>亦將加以考慮、按前市長兪鴻鈞會與工部局前總裁費信惇談判越界建路問題、歷時數年、但其間未對公共租界警務員發生槍擊案或恐怖行動、雙方終乃商妥暫定條的、規定組織界外馬路之特別聯合管理機關、由華人任主任、而由工部局薦舉、經中政府委任之、外人任副主任、但此項解决</p>
<p>外懸問題</p>
<p>之試探計畫、遭日本破壞、因該新的管理機關將完全控制自靶子路起之北四川路、日人乃感彼等之「勢力範圍　受其影響、允因此項計劃、對於當時正在擴充的日陸戰隊兵營之軍略之價値、</p>
<p>頗有影響</p>
<p>故日人大加反對、因日之拒不通過此計劃、兪鴻鈞與費信惇之談話、乃暫告停頓、旋戰起後、華軍撤退、兪氏離職、費信惇亦告退休、此項計劃、遂不得不予以放棄、</p>
<h3>消息傳來　全滬欣慰</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、上海今（二十一日）晨接訊、而悉美政府已保證援助工部局解決如大道當局刻圖攫奪之區中、昨夜發生之巡捕死傷各一名等事件、乃歡愉若在、紛紛談論者、均爲美國務卿赫爾所發與工部局合作之言論、記者今晨走訪工部局總董樊克令、據稱、美國務卿之言、</p>
<p>極可感謝</p>
<p>渠尚無時間與工部局各董事及美當局討論新發展、無論如何此可表示對於界外馬路之美僑生命與財產、將加以保護云、查樊氏昨（二十日夜會稱如寓居界外馬路區之美國人民需要保護、渠當請求美政府予以</p>
<p>此種保護</p>
<p>云、美僑聞訊、頗為欣慰、且美海軍陸戰隊將開該區保護美僑許多生命與大量財產之說、傳佈益盛、惟一般人感覺該區旣爲英軍防區、則加以保、護一節，初乃英軍之事、因英美等防軍顯不能僅保護公共租界全區之本國僑民、故各區原係分派</p>
<p>各國駐軍</p>
<p>防守、而各負照料此等區域中各國人民之責、許多人均感駐滬英軍未能充量保護其防區、其咎非在英軍本身、乃在英政府、此點似係本埠美僑所扼腕者、惟於需要時、美人將不稍遲疑、而予英人以援手、關於助警務處、</p>
<p>英國外相</p>
<p>哈里法克斯對於上海歹土區局勢、未發任何言論一節、今晨本市加以苛評、說者謂英外相已復忘上海之存在矣、至於美海軍陸戰隊將吾入英軍防區、則截至今日午後爲止、尚未接得消息、惟同時、工作過度之駐滬英軍兩大隊鑒於突發擊斃巡捕事件已派出許多巡邏隊協</p>
<h3>樊氏函請　領團注意</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、昨（二十日）晚警務處華捕一名被殺、印捕一名受傷後、　軍今（二十一日）晨即在愚園路一帶各交叉之交通信號旁佈哨位、工部局總董樊克令定今日致意外事件之注意、聞總董函內將指此事件為界外馬路現有</p>
<p>嚴重局勢</p>
<p>之例證、並將正式綜述此事經過、英軍東旭萊聯隊士兵今日淸晨即已出防、該區各交通信號旁與十字路口、均駐有哨兵兩名、據若干方面相信、「特別市府」切望接收界外馬路區交通信號之完全管理權、乃昨夜槍擊案之動機、或謂八月間會有「特別市府」警察在昨夜槍擊地點附近、遭公共租界巡捕槍擊、死傷三名、</p>
<p>欲施報復</p>
<p>結果乃起此槍聲案、今晨東旭業聯隊續派英兵沿西區各馬路駐守、特別巡邏隊來往不斷巡行、近來界外馬路上之「特別市府」警察漸增、惟今日全晨、西區未見此輩警察、警務處今晨仍在進行調查、故對於昨夜事件、尚未發表正式報告、參加是案之暴徒人數、今晨未能確悉、或謂</p>
<p>暴徒一羣</p>
<p>計三至五人、受傷印捕令晨仍臥醫院治療、衆信其傷勢不甚嚴重、又英軍今日在億定盤路與愚園路及大西路兩交叉處、開始堆置沙袋防壘兩個、將永久派兵駐守其中、英軍司令西蒙斯今日以鮮花贈受傷印捕、並附條祝賀其勇敢之精神、</p>
<h3>租界邊區　戒備森嚴</h3>
<p>公共租界之西區邊境、宛似受攻擊區域、甲胄森嚴、如臨大敵、以防萬一、各國兵士及警探、咸全副武裝、密布各處、大中社記者、昨往該區巡視一周、見越界築路區域、僞警狀甚觳觫、一舉一動、多垂首聽命於日憲兵、英軍東旭萊隊、則在人行道上、碌碌</p>
<p>赶築沙堡</p>
<p>一都英軍、則全身鋼甲、在路中巡邏、紅色鐵甲車上裝湯潑生機槍、由捕房警探管理、駐守衝道、探捕背負來復、手執左輪、咸作行動之勢、空氣之緊張、得未曾有、愚園路兩旁僞警、不下五百餘名、每隔十碼即有一崗、自地豐路起、直至在精衛宅、此種示威布置、實另有原因、蓋日軍</p>
<p>坂垣少將</p>
<p>於昨日訪汪也、僞警由日憲兵之指揮、於昨日下午一時三十分、出現於愚園路、一時後、汽車二十輛、速貫通過、其一輛有機器脚踏車四輛衛護、喇叭齊鳴、坂垣即於此時入汪宅、二小時後、汽車列隊、循原路駛返、僞警旋亦撤除特別布置、仍留尋常數量、於各路口交通崗位與租界巡捕作</p>
<p>雙崗對峙</p>
<p>大中社記者於昨日視察時、發見一極有興趣之對比、蓋坂垣少將出門時之侍從保衛、旣如是其森嚴、而英防軍司令西蒙司少將、昨日親往越界築路區視察一周、監督英兵建築沙堡工程時、竟爲單身客、隨從者僅毫無武裝之汽車夫一人而已、英軍亞熙摩爾少校、昨晨赴越界築路視察後、因命英軍在億定盤路大西路之西南角、及億定盤路東北角、</p>
<p>起建沙堡</p>
<p>一座、東旭萊兵士奉命、立即開始工作、直至黃昏時始工竣、即由該隊士兵駐守計在越界築路行使職守之租界巡捕的二百餘人、允以億定盤路之大西路及愚園路兩交叉點、布防更密、因僞市府曾屢對該兩地點之交通崗位、加以威脅、且於二十日晚發生襲擊租界巡捕事件、</p>
<h3>費利浦之　嚴正態度</h3>
<p>字林報云、記者昨（二十日）晚走訪工部局總裁費利浦、據發表下列言論、警務處巡捕昨夜遭卑怯之襲擊、將使上海與在華有僑民之各國政府、皆爲之震驚、西區界外馬路、係工部局所築造與維持、由警務處掌警務事宜者、已歷多年、工部局曾耗鉅資、以發展此西區、結果西區乃成秩序井然、管理進步之區域、工部局對於界外馬路所建地之華方主權、從未加以吾認、目對於西區警務與稅收之有建設性的任何建議、恒凖備從事合理的討論、往昔之華方行政機關、未圖以武力將工部局權力逐出此區、惟令日工部局則遭武力恫嚇、致法律與秩序、受嚴重之威脅、上海爲國際的中立都市、有其獨特之地位、此種地位、　　國之支持、始克予以維持、工部局並非有主權之國家、而係代表在滬有僑民各國的利益之市政團體、工部局今日已遭對於各國多年努力、而在西區樹立之權益、似置之不顧者之威脅、工部局信賴世界公論與各國當局之援助云、</p>
<h3>樊氏聲明　決不讓步</h3>
<p>工部局總董樊克令、前晚發表聲明、以肯定之措辭稱、「工部局對越界築路之權益、決不作任何一點之讓步、余等不能置該區享受工部局保護之外僑於不顧」、樊氏並表示、設居住越界築路區域之美僑、至需要適常保護時、美國政府當派兵保護之、記者詢以在如此情形下、是吾可使美國海軍陸戰隊在越界築路代行巡邏職務、樊氏答、如其有此需要而美海軍經要求在該區巡邏時、當可如是辦理、惟以保護美國人之權益爲限、至其他外國人則惟有依賴於其本國政府、記者又詢以工部局將用何種方法以防止其越界築路權益之被逐、樊氏表示、現在不能宣布、因工部局尚未覓得顯明可見之保護權益的方法也、</p>
<h3>侵華戰事失利後　日將孤注一擲　日海軍三艦隊全部動員　西尾昇全華日軍總司令</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、近據可靠方面消息日本按照其早日結束戰事之最近計劃、或將派全海軍參加中日戰事、西尾近日升任全華日軍總司令、而日本前陸相板垣任副總司令、乃加强軍事力量、並在目前在華作戰日軍間、樹立更密切接觸的大計劃之一部份、日陸軍有調動後、衆料日海軍將續派軍艦參戰者、巳非一日、據述及在華日海軍或將調動之消息稱、日本第三艦隊、目下在華從事一切日方海軍活動者、將全調華北、現泊日木之第一艦隊將駛華中、而第二艦隊則將在華南進行活動、</p>
<h3>日佔交行房屋　將提交涉　由交行請工部局　與日方磋商歸還</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（二十日）據此間金融界消息、交通滬行人員、已接重慶總行訓令、即將呈請工部局與日方磋商歸還交行被佔房產事、按該行房產、係日憲兵於一週前欲租用一部份未果而加强佔者、所佔計有四五兩層樓、已改成日憲兵宿舍、局方雖與日方磋商、但尚未能收回該兩層樓、同時行方繼續在該屋末兩層辦公、用面臨外灘之大門出入、</p>
<h3>電車代價劵　逐漸收回　二批分幣券發行後　兩租界應限制出境</h3>
<p>中行首批分幣券五十萬元發行後、以市民囤積不用、兼有流入淪陷區者、市上仍不敷、上海市第一特區市民聯合會昨致中央銀行函、對二批五十萬元、務乞早日發行、俾滬市零幣缺乏問題、得獲整個解决、該會又分函兩租界電車公司、請將所發行之臨時代幣券、即予限期收回俾零幣缺乏之過渡狀態、早成過去、查電車三分代價券、公司方面正在收回作廢、但市上仍可通用、預定展期至下月二十日截止、至電車代價券發行總額極鉅、據聞的近七十萬元、故二批分幣券發行後、如再任其流出特區界外、仍恐不敷市用也、</p>
<h3>運甬貨件起卸　遇風延誤　船期多已更改　來貨絕無僅有</h3>
<p>滬甬綫目財部命令出口貨須結滙後、由甬來貨遂感銳减、故各輪祇有去貨、而無來貨、照例應船期縮短、惟近日南洋方面颶風經過、因此對於起卸貨物延誤、十六·十七日應到之海達。謀福·永泰等輪、至今尚未到滬、茲聞海達輪兮晨可抵滬、即於明日赴甬、略儎乘客外、貨物一概不裝、因該輪赴甬後、尚須轉往南洋、至海達輪各報關行預定之噸位、該公司現改由二十四日自港返滬之大埔輪裝儎赴甬、禮和洋行謀福輪二十四日可返滬、的二十六七赴甬、泰昌祥之永泰馬勒、日內亦可返滬、繼續駛甬、</p>

<h3>上海方面證實　漢口日軍譁變　槍殺十三名後始告敉平　受傷日兵均於夜間登艦</h3>
<p>大陸報云、前傳兩月前漢口日軍譁變消息、昨日（廿日）已自新從漢口抵滬之某著名外僑與本埠某領署官員獲得證實、據實况稱、久駐漢口之日軍兩師團、對於戰事乏效而繼續延長、日增不滿、致有數小隊公開叛變、拒不服從命令、經日軍當局槍决日兵十三名、始告敉平、其中一師團、立即調離漢口、衆信另一師團則派出參加最近之長沙戰役、縱僑居漢市之外人、亦極難獲得消息、蓋行動受限制、且日方檢查不懈也、例如漢口街道中從未見日傷兵運過、惟駛漢之醫療艦、則顯無已時、蓋受傷與患病之日兵、均在夜間載運登艦、而醫療艦亦必於夜間駛出也、漢口華人之民氣、幾係公開愛國者、彼等日常談話之最重要話題、厥爲華軍不久將重入漢市、</p>
<h3>圓瑛失蹤後　各界關懷　安全可無虞　營救頗困難</h3>
<p>中國佛敎會理事長圓瑛法師、自在大西路四四三號圓明講堂內被架後、據大通社訊者昨晨續向赫德路佛敎會及圓明講堂方面探詢、尚無獲知其行蹤所在、外報雖有被拘於滬西極司非爾路九十四號日憲兵隊部之紀載、惟佛敎界方面胥不置信、因渠平日行止、並不足以招致日方嫉忌之處也、查圓瑛在新加坡時、除爲中國佛敎會勸募基金外、亦曾爲中國難民募捐、凡此措施、胥屬僧人本色、不脫慈悲爲本、至佛敎會暨其友人方面、信渠之安全、當可無虞、至能吾迅速獲釋、則殊難言、</p>
<h3>狙擊滬西警捕目的　圖攫交通崗位　工部局尙不擬提出抗議　兇犯係偽警已確切證明</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨日（廿日）午後六時四十四分、億定盤路愚園路口、有警務處華捕一名、遭便衣暴徒二人、當塲擊斃、印捕一名、則受重傷、該三暴徒係自南面循億定盤路行近第四五九號印捕、其中二人突攫印捕兩手反執至背後、並令其不得移動、第三人的立三呎外、手執盒子砲、直指印捕、印捕圖掙脫兩人、暴徒之一即令第三人開槍、一彈發出、射入印捕右胸三暴徒乃擬竄逃、為圖安然逃逸計、竟開槍　斃站立邊右上之第三三七八號華捕、而駐守該地之「特別市府」武裝警察、一聞槍聲、立即儘速逃避、而不多學科援助寡不敵衆之警務處巡捕、此乃西區罕曾發生的最大胆脅迫警務處人員之企圖、全係挑釁性質、槍擊案發生結果、大隊巡捕與東旭萊等隊英兵、週巡該區附近、以防復起不幸事件、</p>
<p>關於一十日晚華印捕在越界築路崗位被襲擊案、工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥昨（二十一日）發表談話稱、一局方現時尚不擬提出抗議、且亦不作此考慮？以爲時尚早、一般相信此案兇犯、必與僞警有關、今就調查獲得之證明、已可確切論定矣、」據大中社記者從租界警務當局探悉、捕房方面、自前晚迄昨晨、得眼錢多人之助、偵查此襲擊事件、業已獲得綫索、</p>
<p>暴徒行兇　偽警逃逸</p>
<p>案發前、該印捕方管理交通燈、而被害華捕則係駐立該交地西北面道旁三華捕之一、印捕胸部中彈、幸未入肺、而由另一面穿出、渠雖受傷、仍毅然繼續管理交通、當時有上海電力公司職員英人克蘭克氏在出事地點附近、乃向該印捕奔去、印捕僅稱「余中兩槍」、大的印捕已知身有創傷兩處、而不明瞭乃係一彈穿過故也、三暴徒行兇後、循億定盤路向北逸去、駐立對角持步槍之「特別市府」警察、非但不加援救、抑且拔足飛奔、至二十分鐘後、始復出現於出事地點、巡捕後備隊聞訊、悉數目靜安寺捕房出發、携湯普森式手提機關槍、數分鐘後疾馳到塲、警務處總巡鮑恩·副總巡史密斯·助理總巡桑普遜與的克、均立出親自監督調查、</p>
<p>警務當局　保守緘默</p>
<p>昨日深夜、警務處人員對於槍擊案與尚未捕獲之兇犯、拒不發任何言論、然兇犯究係何人、似頗少狐疑、須憶十月十三日曾有「特別市府」大隊警察强行接管億定盤路與愚園路及大西路兩處交叉地交通燈崗位、交涉久之、始經逐走、又聞特別市府」警察局曾間接揚言彼等當於星期一日、接管該兩交通崗位、但因警務處採取戒備而未果、警務處於星期三日、聞「特別市府」將於星期四日晨作接管該兩交叉地之努力、乃復取强有力之戒備、而未發生事故、故昨晚之槍擊案、只能目之爲直接脅迫値差該地之巡捕、以期加以接管之企圖、今無警務處巡捕發槍之問題、蓋華捕與印捕被舁入救護車時、其手槍均在袋中也、</p>
<p>裝甲汽車　駐守戒備</p>
<p>暴徒所用係盒子砲、據目擊者聲稱、「特別市府」警察實係案發前不數分鐘、即已離塲云、惟此說未能正式證實、卑怯之槍擊案發生後、該地立刻採取特殊戒備、除後備隊巡捕悉數召出外、並有裝甲汽車兩輛駐該交叉地、旣有無數巡捕駐守、英軍當局復大量加派巡邏隊、巡行各界外馬路、昨晚父聞裝甲汽車今日將駐愚園路億定盤路口、與大西路億定盤路口、以防「特別市府」警察復作强迫干涉該兩交通崗位之任何企圖、</p>
<h3>洋貨輸入銳減　滬關變為出超　輸出激暢美銷反見增加　整個貿易已見好轉現象</h3>
<p>財政部以其全力調整對外貿易後、今西南各關均已變爲出超、惟淪陷區域之上海關依然入超、並佔各關之首位、自歐戰發生後、因航行關係、英法德對華貿易大受打擊、於是上海關進口銳减、出口因美銷轉暢反見增加、九月份滬關巳變爲出超、計國幣一千七百八十九萬四千一百六十四元、此種情形、實爲中國貿易好轉現象、茲錄九月份滬關進出口貿易如下、</p>
<p>進口洋貨</p>
<p>棉花棉紗棉綫凈値國幣一八·一二七·九三一元、燭皂油脂蠟松香計四·二三〇·八七五元、金屬及礦砂計三·五二五·九五六元、煤燃料瀝靑煤膏計三·二八七·九五六元、毛及其製品計二·八二〇·一八三元、化學產品及製藥計二·一三九·三四六元、書籍地圖紙及木造紙質計一·八七三·四三六元、染斜顏料油漆凡立水計一·八九七·七八三元、共値國幣四八·八一六·九一六元、</p>

<p>變為出超</p>
<p>九月份貿易進出口總値國幣一一五·五二七·九九六元、出超一七，八九四·一六四元、比較八月份進口减少一六·六三七·三三二元、出口增加五·五〇〇·二一一元、計輸入减少百分之二四·五六强·出口增加百分之九·九四强、關於十月份之貿易其出超數字、勢必較九月份更爲增加、此種情形、實有益於中國抗戰前途、使中國貿易逆勢得以挽回、國際收入得以平衡云、</p>

<h3>錯</h3>
<p>— 宛文</p>
<p>無論大的錯小的錯，那一個人沒有錯的地方，不但小朋友有錯，成人們也有錯，就是社會上的大人物不免亦要錯，所以人有了錯，不是羞恥的事，小朋友們的不肯認錯，不肯改錯，才是很羞恥的。</p>
<p>我們爲什麽會有錯呢？有的是無意做的，有的是有意做的，無意的做錯，在小朋友是很容易發生的，因爲你們受的知識少，經騐不豐富，例如寫錯一個字，或說錯一句話，有時自己還沒有知曉，一經人指點，下决留心着改，以後就不會錯了。所以無意的錯，有時反而使我們增加常識，使錯的事漸漸减少。有的是有意錯的，例如你們明知不誠實是不能做的，而自己不能管束的說謊，或拿了他人的物品。這種錯如果不立志改，那麽以後不但在小事上如此，就是大事上也要如此，有了不名譽的行爲，那你就被衆人蔑視了。</p>
<p>最不好的，是自己做錯事，便自己原諒自己，他人做錯事，在背後非難他譏笑他，這種態度都是不對的。我們應常對於自己一些小錯，就要改過，對於他人的錯，應該在他面前誠懇指點他，勸導他，使他下决不再錯，如果這樣互相切磋，我們的團體就很健全的了。</p>
<p>最後我把「待人要寬大，待己當嚴厲，」這句話送給小朋友，要你在生活中時時檢查自己的行爲，小錯枝枝節節的改去，以後即使遇到困難的事，也不會有錯了，對於我們將來事業成功，是很有關係的。</p>
<h3>兒童電話局</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>在俄國莫斯科中央公園裏，「阿基米德太」會的幹練會員，設立了一所兒童電話局。局中的職務，自局長至茶役，都是由兒童們自己擔任的。總共有電話綫路八十條，分連在中央公園的各部份，及該園中的各機關，和兒童農村中的各辦事室。另外有電話分機二十五架，分佈在公園里的四週及中央。每架分機代表一個俄國的大城市，一共代表二十五個重要的城市。在每架電話機的旁邊，有一位兒童守候着。這兒童就是代表該城市的市長，總局一有命令，就能立刻宣佈全園，異常迅速。</p>
<p>假想甲城發生事變擾亂的時候，即以電話至乙丙二城乞援。假使丁城發生不測的時候，亦可與丙戊二城互通消息。以此電話培植兒童將來爲國家服務的根本基礎。</p>
<p>在某個時期，這二十五架電話的名字，改爲二十五國國家的首都。每個兒童代表一個國家，彼此在電話中通訊，發表自己的言論意見等。其用意就是使每個兒童利用電話作爲國際通訊的電台，使兒童從小就養成國際間的友邦觀念。</p>
<h3>地球像什麼</h3>
<p>弟弟說：「地球像皮球，中空外邊圓。」</p>
<p>妹妹說：「地球像橘子，不圓帶些扁。」</p>
<p>姐姐說：「地球像陀蝶，自己團團轉。」</p>
<p>哥哥說：「地球像飛機繞着燈光玩。」</p>

<h3>歸家</h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>——明兒避難記之三十九——</p>
<p>三雙脚踏進了縣城，不到一個鐘點，他們已自縣城的西首到達了東端的城牆，分明的已把那城走盡了。他們再從西首的城門裏踏上了原來的路歸家，不過他們的空籃子已經裝滿了靑葱葱的菜蔬——菠菜哪薺菜哪，靑菜哪，無論什麽菜蔬一概都需要，然而三隻籃子是有限的，任他們把菜向籃子裏撳塞，仍漏落了很多很多的菜蔬在城裏，恨不得採取「凡是菜蔬都來歸我」的策略，把它們一起都包買了下來，扛將回去。</p>
<p>「那個城怎麽被我們一走就完了。這樣狹窄的街道，沒有車，沒有轎，幾爿小小的店舖，沒有電燈，沒有自來水，這可以配得上稱爲縣城的嗎？」在歸家途中明兒心中暗喑的很有些替自己繁盛而摩登的故鄕鳴不平，又似乎很輕視它的樣兒說着。</p>
<p>「你不要小覷了它。在形式上它雖是不合縣城的條件，也許在形勢上，商業上，經濟上，軍事上自有它的重耍性。你可曾瞧見：那裏有縣政府，敎育局，民衆敎育館，很完備，不過是小型的罷了。所謂「麻雀雖小，五臟俱全，」這一句話和那縣城倒是狠吻合的」。父親似乎站在那縣城的一方，袒護似的替它辯正。這幾句話，把那話匣子打斷了。</p>
<p>這時那縣城已被小山丘遮住了他們的視錢，這顯然離別了那城已有好一段的路程，那籃子怎麽漸漸地重了起來？在當初買的時候，存着越多越好的心理，把東西撳的撳，塞的塞，安排得很好，籃子裏的容量已滿得不可再滿了。提一提也不覺得十分笨置。現在可不得了，走了一會，籃子便加重了幾斤，手臂的負擔也隨着增加，脚也沈重了不少。一隻手提了，走不到幾十步路，便告班了，另、一隻手原不高興，但是無可奈何地接了下來，笨重得不堪，似乎有一塊大石向臂上壓着，使那條臂一陣陣的痠，這樣的趕路，太吃苦了，畢竟人是聰明的：受了苦便改變方針。他們把手巾紥在籃子上，背在肩上走，起先倒很靜適，手臂也輕鬆了許多。可是那脚每一步的移動，似乎地心隨着加大它的吸力，肩上的藍子要被吸力拉下地去的模樣，因此肩上發生了反抗的力量，它的負擔便加重了。</p>
<p>路雖是趕去了一半以上，可是籃子重量的增加，倒加上了二三倍，兩隻肩輸換得也無力量，手臂也沒有恢復原狀。他父親的手杖便被他們利用了：把三隻籃子縛在手杖的中央，兩端扛着走，這樣一個人便可空着手走了，扛的人肩上也好像因了方式的改換而輕了一些，走了一程路，替換了一個，再趕了一段路，又更換了一個好容易望見了那是他們的家的村子了。拐了幾個灣便進了村子的區域，他們心想快要到家了，便加快着步子，那知愈想早一些到家，愈是走得快，可是走了似乎好一大段路，望望自己家裏的屋頂，還有不少的路，更耐着性，更飛快的走，這時也小顧臂裏的痠，脚的沉重，很與奮的各自提着籃跑回家去，終於到達了家，放下了那笨重的籃子，長長的吐了一口氣。那晚，母親燒了很美味的菜肴，算是犒賞他們的出力。</p>
<h3>兒童遊樂會</h3>
<p>— 金丁</p>
<p>爲了兒童是未來國家的主人翁，是國家民族的根苗，因此，我們對於兒童幸福的注意，是應該多方面的提倡，「兒童游藝，」自然也不能例外。</p>
<p>新新公司當局，對於兒童幸福的注意，向來是相當努力的·最近，在新都飯店開慕之後，更規定每個星期日，舉行一次「兒童遊樂會，」時間是上午十時至十二時，地點在新都六樓的申曲塲。</p>
<p>每一次的「兒童遊樂會，筆者總是帶了　個小孩子，狠高興的去參加着。爲了他們不售門票，絕對歡迎兒童參加的緣故，因此，小朋友的數量，當然是佔了極大部份。</p>
<p>在「兒童遊樂會」裹，它所演出的，有兒童的播音，演講，歌唱，跳舞，有價値的敎育電影，一面開映，一面說明，使每個兒童，都能明白電影中的意義，此外，如國術的表演，魔術的演幻，在在都能啟發兒童向上的意志，和科學的思想。</p>
<h3>藍矮子</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>阿麗也不管伯父的疲倦，仍然追問道：「這森林可是全省中最大的一個麼？」伯父睡意惺忪，也並沒有聽淸楚阿麗問的是什麽，信口答道：「是啊！是啊！是最大的了。」阿麗又驚又喜的吐了一口氣，心中想道：「要是世上眞有矮子國的話，那麽」定是在這裏的了。」當下伊又放聲向伯父道「伯伯，我要請問你——」伯母懶懶的抬起頭來說道：「親愛的孩子，你靜些吧，最好你也小睡一會，這森林大得很，還要趕好一段路才能出林哩。」阿麗聽了這話，很不高興，也就不再開口了。</p>
<p>他們的馬車到了森林中那個小村子裹，就停下來休息了；當下却發見了內中一匹馬的上只蹄鐵出了岔子了，村人都來帮忙，也沒有用，到得子細察看之後，才知道非重新打一個新蹄鐵不可，如此他們一行人一時就不能繼續趕路哩。那最近的一家鐵店，也在二英里外，須由車夫把那馬帶去，再帶回來，這一去一來，至少就要二三小時。此刻已過六點鐘，在他們整個的行程中，還沒有趕到一半的路。那車夫搖了搖頭，說他當夜不願前去，必須等到明天早上方可出發·那馬因為蹄鐵出了岔子，已刺傷了脚，要是不給它充分的休息，難免發炎，要是把它留下來，單用一匹馬趕路，那麼車身太重，怕受不了。</p>
<p>伯父想了一想，忽然得了一個主意，笑着向伯母道：「我看我們這幾個人，就是用一匹馬也行，我們何妨試一下子。」伯母忙道：「我們何必勉强趕路，就在這裏休息一夜也不打緊。好在小客店中，也有兩間臥房，很是舒服；至於吃的東西，他們總也能供給一些，我們只要有些啤酒，香腸，黃麵包，也就行了。」</p>
<p>伯父很成，阿立尤其高興，析算立刻就走，但是阿麗却冷冷淡淡的，並無表示。伯母忙道：「阿麗，你可是不願意和我們一塊兒去嗎？剛才你在車上沒有打過瞌睡，也許覺得疲倦了嗎？」</p>
<p>阿麗雖然並不疲倦，但因自己別有企圖，就撒了個慌道：「是的，我有些疲倦了·要是你們能原諒我的話，那我願意守在這裏　休息；好在我有書本可讀，不會寂寞，並且我也很愛這一帶的林子呢。」</p>
<p>伯父道：「那麼你不和我們一同去也好，但你倘要到林子裏去走走，可當心迷失了路。」一面他又回頭向伯母道；你放心，這裏一帶的林子很為安靜，旣沒有豺狼虎豹，也沒有強盜和歹人的。」</p>

<h3>無綫電影的特點</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>無綫電影是開始實現了，同時，好萊塢的影片公司，已得到切實的保證，就是將來無綫電影風行之後，好萊塢各公司所製的影片，可大量供給，作播映無綫電影之用。</p>
<p>一待無綫電影風行之後，連同影像和聲音的複製，成本可非常便宜，而且所有的電臺上都可播映不必費了許多錢播送到全國各地。所有節目，可預先編成目錄，並於事前先送到檢查處加以檢查避免臨時發生阻礙。</p>
<p>節目定當後，就在通常的製片公司，由通常的電影演員攝製。這樣可補救好萊塢目前感到頭痛的一件事，就是電影演員的上電臺廣播，臨時吊嗓，都足影饗公司方面工作的進行。</p>
<p>就上面所說的種種，我們已看出無綫電影與電影事業有着相互的關係，所以無綫電影風行以後，不但不會影響電影事業，相反的，可使影片公司增多一種合於無綫電影的影片的製作。我想諸位讀者一定企求着這新發明的作品，快些呈現於我們的眼簾呢。</p>
<h3>王瑤卿決定來滬</h3>
<p>— 南腔北調人</p>
<p>——與王玉蓉一同南——</p>
<p>老伶工王瑤卿，與滬人睽別已久，自搭鄭家木橋老共舞台後，直到如今，有十餘年之久，從未南下過，現黃金已派人至平邀妥瑤卿得意女弟子王玉蓉南下奏藝，並請老供奉偕與俱來，看看十餘年未見之刦後孤島景物，但王大爺因年邁，有暈船症，婉却黃金之請，惟玉蓉自入王門後，蜚聲北國，從未一返舊地，者番「錦衣榮歸」，亦堅邀老師一同南下，斯時海上梨園，即有兩種傳說：其一：王大爺未必來滬，其二：老供奉準可南下，消息兩岐，莫衷一是，茲卑人從「半官方面」得來消息，玉蓉已有專電致與玉蓉最接近之某方，（昨晚七時三十分到達）文僅十二字：「老師經蓉力懇準同順天起程」云云，祇要中途沒有變卦，此事當不致豁邊，詢問黃金當局，亦不吾認，但瑤卿此來，當係遊玩性質，是吾在黃金登台唱幾天，尚需俟來滬後再行定奪，順天輪已於日前自滬起椗，則一往一返，王氏師徒來滬之期當不遠，卑人敢爲讀者告：「王瑤卿決定來滬」。</p>
<h3>「唔」女郎的婚謎</h3>
<p>新獲「唔女郎」尊號的安秀麗丹，是好萊塢一顆最光明燦爛的新星她那超然性的美麗，能使人一見後，失魂落餽，所以爲她顚倒的靑年男子不知有多少，雖年過不惑的老先生們，也莫不承認她是一個見所未見，聞所未聞的可人兒，美國的投機商人便都想出利用安秀麗丹芳名，作商品或商店的號召，什麽秀麗丹襪，秀麗丹褲，安秀麗丹咖啡館，秀麗丹冰淇淋等，比比皆是，凡每一個商品或店舖，只需冠了安秀麗丹的名字，便莫不利市三倍，由此可見一般人對於安秀麗丹的然了！</p>
<p>安小姐今年二十叫歲，她生於美國Texas地方祖先的血統中含有蘇格蘭，愛爾蘭和印度的血素，這便是造成今日安小姐一種特殊化美的原因，她從前會和一個電影演員結婚，不久便宣告仳離，直到現在尚水得到新的意中人，所以一般崇拜她的男性，不論識與不識，都時常投函向她求愛，這類的信件每日起碼四百餘封，但安小姐却從不置答，往字紙籠中一擲便了事，這並不是安小姐無情，而據說是因爲她預備抱獨身主義呀！雖說近日來她和男星雪柴羅蜜羅時常同出同進，情形很親密，但安小姐却絕對吾認有羅曼斯的故事存在，究竟如何，那只得聽下回分解了！　（德綱）</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>何日君再來　（下）</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“When　Tomorrow　Comes”</p>
<p>却爾斯鮑育和愛琳鄧的演技，在「畫中愛寵」已使人留着深刻的印象，道部再度合作的「何日君再來」，依然保持着過去的成績。我以爲演得最好的幾塲戲是：（一）從敎堂出來，却爾斯鮑育要去見他的妻子，問愛琳鄧願意見她嗎，愛琳鄧搖搖頭，却爾斯鮑育走後，她悄然搭上開往紐約的公共汽車。（二）却爾期鮑育送愛琳鄧下車，及重訪愛琳鄧。（三）白葩蘭訪愛琳鄧。（四）他們最後的分別：「我將要回來。」却爾斯鮑育說；「我將等着你。」愛琳鄧回答。這塲戲中，他們雖然一貫地平淡穩重，但是心理狀態的衝突，矛盾，都溢於言表</p>
<p>看慣了高速度戀愛術的好萊塢電影，像「何日君再來」這樣的電影（雖然也是一個戀愛故事），無論導演技術演員演技，以及攝影燈光（敎堂中燃臘燭時）等都是値得學習的。</p>
<h3>虞婚劇目</h3>
<p>— 禹公</p>
<p>虞洽卿先生長孫積澐君之嘉禮，有盛大堂會，已誌昨報，聞此决戲提調係黃金大戲院主人金廷蓀先生，實則金老係虞婚之總務，一切事務，悉委諸孫蘭亭吳江楓在其俊趙培鑫，及其文郎金元聲等辦理，是日（即明日）劇目，已全部派定，下午兩時開鑼，李富春王小樵之大賜福，劉漢臣（前喬玄後張飛）雪又琴（孫尚香）高雪樵（趙雲）徐鴻培（劉備）全本甘露寺廻荊州蘆花蕩。張淑蘭梁一鳴之馬蹄黃金，小小王桂卿小二王桂卿小三王桂卿之小小水濂洞，吳素秋韓金奎孫瑤芳之春香鬧學，小玲紅蓋三省趙志秋之拾玉鐲，胡培鑫李克昌汪其俊之捉放曹宿店，張淑嫻李君玉除志華之新安驛，周信芳胡如泉袁世海之戰長沙，宋德珠芙蓉草暨宋劇團全體同人之金山寺，上述劇目，悉係整本大套，首尾演全，預算時間，演至天明方克竣事，至後來黃金之楊寶森，共舞台王少樓，卡爾登高百歲諸藝員，本已加入，因時間關係，祇能婉言辭謝，如此一台好戲，班底衣箱爲韓金奎之金玉堂，想是晚不特新都飯店車水馬龍，即韓金奎也要忙得不能開交也。</p>
<h3>閒話趙金蓉</h3>
<p>— 倪秋萍</p>
<p>這决更新邀的角兒，一塊兒來，分期演唱，眞特別。趙金蓉是第二期登台的角兒，上海人對於她恐怕有點陌生罷。說起來，金蓉遭遇很不好，才九歲，就喪了父·她在十三歲那年進的戲曲學校，民國二十六年畢業·（比侯玉蘭早一年）此校後曾經自己組班，那些好角兒如姜妙香，李多奎，陳少霖等，都傍着她，在故都非常走運。她的玩藝兒，除了在戲校學習之外，會請敎家師王瑤卿；至於梅派一路，（如洛神鳳還巢等）都是徐蘭園所授。近有某君提議要余蓉投拜郭效靑先生，郭君曾覆：「凡是辦得到事，都可以，沒有什麽不成的。」這樣，大槪沒有什麽問題了罷。暇嘗與金蓉談起各種梨園故事及藝術，伊一一對答如流，且很謙虛，我對於謙和的人，曾有一種經騐——越賺的人，能耐越大；趙金蓉誠不失爲後起之秀。</p>
<p>趙金蓉學的是靑衣和花旦；對於唱腔一半取程，一半取梅。學梅程的人最多，至於學成什麽樣子，那是全仗自己的，願金蓉勉之。</p>

<p>國際動態</p>
<h3>在觀望中的意國外交政策</h3>
<p>— 獨行</p>
<p>徘徊於兩個集體之間尚未有決策　站在勝利方面依然是其一貫作風</p>
<p>墨索里尼向來比希特勒穩健，自從意國宣　中立之後，他一面與德國信使不絕往來，一面又向英法頻送秋波。在波蘭被瓜分之後，俄國的勢力已經接近巴爾幹半島，我們大可以從墨索里尼冷靜的頭腦裏面，看出他的焦燥不安。</p>
<p>意國感受威脅</p>
<p>事實上，墨索里尼宣佈中立的原因，實有不得　的苦衷在。他曉得希　勒躱在其西綫的堡壘後面，對於他的地位，暫時是不碍事的：然而墨索里尼自　所站的地方，却是世界上火力最猛烈的去處。萬一他左袒希特勒，一有軍事行動，則意大利北部立可遭受法國陸軍的蹂躪，英法地中海聯合艦隊也不難把意大利沿海都市摧毀。土耳其更不難自希臘那邊以躡意國之後。</p>
<p>患難朋友拆夥</p>
<p>除掉上述，還有不少足使墨索里尼深感煩悶的理由呢。墨索里尼聘有希特勒所派來的專家和軍事人員。這　次希特勒却不顧他久經患難的朋友，同史太林勾結起來，給予法西斯主義的侮辱，可眞不少！這樣一來，墨索里尼　不能呌弗朗哥將軍自西班牙拊法國之背了。同時意大利是個貧困的國家，雖然墨索里尼能把他的百姓送上火綫，然而意大利的人民誰又願誠實的作戰呢？所以，墨索里尼之宣布中立，實在是他合乎邏輯的一貫行動，也是勢所必然。他又恐蘇德挾其戰勝的威勢向巴爾幹發展，這也是墨索里尼所不能容忍的，惴惴不安及不願同希特勒一鼻孔出氣的緣故。</p>
<p>然而在現行局勢之下，墨索里尼的中立眞能久待嗎？蘇聯勢力向巴爾幹半島的伸張，不會搖動意大利的中立地位嗎？意大利在一九一五年已經拖　德皇的跳板了，這一决誰能檐保墨索里尼不會拆希特勒的台呢？對於這，墨索里尼己經堅决地否認他與希特勒有異心了。然而我們決不能忽視英法所加諸墨索里尼的壓力。自從戰事爆發以來，墨索里尼的女婿齊亞諾外長辦公室的座上客，經常就是英法兩國的駐意大使。最近意國新任駐英大使走馬上任，與英外相哈里法克斯密談，據說負有墨索里尼的重要使命。於此我們可以看出墨索里尼所走的方向了。目前他雖然保守中立，不過是抄襲上次大戰的故智而已，結果　是難免投入火坑的</p>
<p>我們且看墨索里尼，他在宣佈中立以前，也會裝腔作勢，眞若他也要同他的伙伴希特勒一同工作似的。他在希持勒向波蘭放第一砲之後，即刻實施極縝密的動員工作，使他的百姓坐立不安；全國實行燈火管制，咖啡祇許售給兵士，汽油祇有國家機關有權取用，一切私人的汽車旅行，在九月三日以後一律禁止。後來，中立决定了，才把恐怖的空氣鬆弛了下來。墨索里尼祇有一句話：一意國倘遇攻擊，當即抵抗。」其實，祇有他攻擊別人的份兒，別人是决不會攻擊他的。他又把本部軍隊分由格雷志尼將軍（Generae　Gragiani）和皇儲恩波吐王子（Crown　Prince　Umderto）統率，前者素同　特勒沒有好感，後者則是意大利人民所擁護，我們於此可見墨索里尼是何用心了。</p>
<p>依然是騎墻的政策</p>
<p>現在，意大利夜間又大放光明了，外國郵件也己按時寄到。意軍己經自利比亞與埃及接壤處撤退，阿爾比尼亞與希臘交界處的意國戍軍也已减少，法國邊界又重新開放了。然而，墨索里尼對於通到德國的山路却還沒有開放呢；一方面在英法密切的監視之下，貨物也已停止自意國運入德境了。</p>
<p>墨索里尼宣佈中立，是在羅馬尼亞築起一道墻頭；掩護巴爾幹半島諸國；一方面他又騎在墻上，用望遠鏡瞧着德法邊境的砲火，和世界局勢的演變，看誰佔着上風，等他看得分曉時，他是會即刻下手的。</p>
<h3>戰地一角　淪陷中的杭城一瞥</h3>
<p>— 淞生</p>
<p>死沉沉地沒有半點生氣</p>
<p>滬杭鐵路被炸後的情形</p>
<p>杭州——我的故鄉！自從被鐵蹄踐踏了以後，一切都改換樣子了，美麗的西湖好像蒙受了很大的羞辱，已經被人們冷落而遺忘；世界著名的錢江巨潮，也沒有人再去鑑賞和觀瞻，異族的武士們，代替了詩人騷客，軋軋的機槍聲，代替了寺院晚鐘，城內是死沈沈地沒有半點兒生氣，雖然最近遷回故居的人已經不少，的合戰前人口的四分之一，可是個個都愁眉苦臉，現出哭笑不得的樣子，城內最繁盛的區域，常有怪樣的和服女子蹀　往來，新市塲也不比從前的熱鬧了，一到晚上，整個杭城，只有稀疏慘綠的電燈，像鬼火般閃爍着，象徵着這是一處怎樣可怕的鬼蜮世界。</p>
<p>我是吻年不回故鄕了，不願去，也怕去，但却因爲是故鄕，還有不少親友困住在裏面，所以總想有一個機會去探望一决，最近才發下一個決心，於雙十節前搭乘滬杭路車前往</p>
<p>漢奸們的火併</p>
<p>路途上的檢查很爲嚴厲據當時同行一位旅客說：「因爲前幾天城內發生了一件槍殺案才如此的。現在杭州城內不知道已混進了多少游擊隊，多則二三千，至少六七百，沒有人知道確數，所以日人怕得不得了啊！」後來打聽，被殺的是日本憲兵特務機關的密探長，名兪祥禎，兇手是他的部下，名任志發，也是當密探的，他們因爲索詐款項，發生意見，在酒席間任乘兪之不意，連開數槍，兪受傷倒地，送至醫院，臨死時，大呼「殺我者任某，速爲我復仇」，於是日軍即將任逮捕，在我到達杭州的一天，預備把他砍首。第二天又接連拘捕了十餘人，其中一人因被拘時形色慌張，竟被認爲參與此案，執行槍決，但一般人都以爲這是死得寃枉的。</p>
<p>日軍的空城計</p>
<p>駐杭日軍也知道城內潛伏着很多的游擊隊，所以夜間決不敢離開防禦工事，便在日間非十餘人結伴同行，也不敢往偏僻街巷中行走，據說少數日兵在僻巷中被人弄死，不止一决了。不但如此，日軍因爲前方戰事吃緊，有的被抽調前錢，有的不願再往前綫，因而懸樑目盡的很多，其中且有不少是軍官，這也可見日兵的厭戰情緒了。</p>
<p>日軍因後方空虛，無兵可調，於是他們却想出一條空城妙計，有時日兵一個不見，有時却又成千百的聚集攏來。原來他們兵力不敷分配，不得不利用交通綫，把各地日軍聯合起來，今日開到這里，明日開到那裏，使人們看了以爲各地都有雄厚的守軍，其實開來開去，還是這幾個日兵。此外在日中或晚間又可常聞得淸晰的機槍聲，也無非虛張聲勢防游擊隊的不時襲擊罷了。</p>
<p>假冒日本女子</p>
<p>在城站附和新市塲一帶地方，常可以看到日本女子坐在黃包車上顧盼自豪。起初不解杭州的日本女子何以這樣多？後來打聽，才知這並不是眞正的日本女子，乃是中國女子所假扮的。她們有的是被漢奸們獻給「皇軍」去當慰勞品的，有的因爲環境的脅誘和生活的困難，被迫嫁給漢奸們做姨太太的。從前杭州城內一般無惡不作的壞人，現在沒一個不官居顯要，沒一個不三妻四妾了。而她們爲了想學時髦，爲了誇示同儕，所以都打扮起日本裝束來。</p>
<p>鐵路被炸情形</p>
<p>只住了四天，我只想離開杭州了，但是被親友們强留，不得已再住了一天，幸而再住一天，否則剛巧碰到游擊隊炸毀鐵路事件，也許回不到上海了。那天十月七號，下午就有消息傳來說長安附近鐵路被炸死傷很多，那時我很担心，生恐火車不通，那我也被困在杭州了。幸而第二天一早去趁車，車還是開的。到了許村，車忽停止，當時也不知爲了什麽，約莫一小時之久，車才開行，到了一個荒野地方，便瞥見昨日被炸的火車計有四節，都仰着天倒在路旁，一邊則是一節火車龍頭，已經破壞不堪，路上立着許多苦力，正在趕修鐵路，才知剛才車行停止就因爲路軌沒有修復的緣故，從昨日早晨被炸，足足經過二十四小時，鐵路還沒修整，也可見當時炸力的猛烈了。這一决，日軍損失很大，死傷人數，雖然日方諱莫如深，但每車每節平均總有六七日兵守備，至少日兵死傷該在二十人以上。乘客死傷的當更數倍於此。</p>
<h3>由西藏黃教　說到新達賴登位</h3>
<p>— 小珊</p>
<p>達賴與班禪</p>
<p>西藏宗教，分紅教黃教二宗，原是佛敎的一個支派。自黃教與盛，而紅教衰敗。黃教的祖宗名宗喀巴，當其圓寂時，遺囑二大弟子，世世以化身轉生，承繼其衣缽，一爲達賴喇嘛，一爲班禪喇嘛。又據藏人所信仰的傳說，達賴是觀世音的化身，班禪是阿彌陀的化身，易世則互相爲師。但以權力而論，達賴是西藏政治而兼宗敎的領袖，而班禪則僅爲宗敎的領袖，究不及達賴。</p>
<p>歷代的達賴</p>
<p>第一世達賴，生於明洪武二十四年，迄最近轉生的達賴共爲十四世。其間道德學問最高者爲五世，政敎權勢最盛者爲十三世。達賴五世深通因果，曾有預言說：「達賴十四世如轉生靑海，則道德學問比五世允高」，現在達賴十四世果在靑海尋獲，所以西藏人民對於他的期望很高。達賴十三世，是於民國二十二年十二月一七日圓寂，而其轉生後身才於去年在靑海塔爾寺尋到，其間足足費了五年光陰，各負責喇嘛百般苦索，備歷艱辛，才算我着了新主。</p>
<p>觀海照鑑法</p>
<p>本來西藏相傅，達賴圓寂後四十五日即化為赤子降生。在九世以前的各達賴，圓寂時，必指明降生何地，但其後則只有所謂「觀海照鑑」之法，以明新達賴降生之地。什麼呌做「觀海照鑑」呢？原來，這種典禮是在拉薩附近的騰格里海舉行的。在典禮舉行的時候，海面上會發生一種類似「海市蜃樓」的景象這就是靈異的指示，可以詳細記下，以爲下世達賴轉生地的根據。十三世達賴圓寂後，由現攝藏政的熱振「呼圖克圖」（大喇嘛能轉生者，稱一呼圖克圖）循例舉行「觀海禮，聽說因爲每决顯示的景象不淸楚，先後照幾百回，到了民國二十五年五月間，才發現新達賴產生地的環境是「一座蓋着琉璃的大廟，廟旁有一蒙古包」。但西藏雖有琉璃瓦大廟而絕無蒙古包，於是推測達賴五世的預言或會應騐，乃開始派遣喇嘛向靑海及蒙古邊境尋訪（按另一說稱，在上决「觀海照鑑」時，海中顯出一地方民族複雜，服飾各異，並有藏文三字，意爲塔爾寺云。）</p>
<p>新達賴尋到</p>
<p>當該喇嘛等，於前年行抵甘寗時，適班禪卓錫該地，對於尋覓達賴後身一事有所指示。喇嘛等遵照指不，遄赴靑海，居然在塔爾寺附近紅土崖地方的土人家，我到達賴第十四世，現年五歲。據聞新達賴雖爲一髫齡童子，而頭角崢嶸，態度沉靜，雙目允炯炯有神。今年七月十三日即山國府護送專員馬元海會同藏方尋覓專員喇嘛等護送出塔爾寺起程回藏，不久就將在拉薩登位。國府乃特派蒙藏委員會長吳忠信氏赴藏，會同熱振主持典禮。據本月十八日重慶電稱，吳氏己於該日乘飛機赴河內，由印度轉道入藏了。</p>

<h3>今日之柏林</h3>
<p>— 松舟</p>
<p>一切都要票券</p>
<p>歐戰發生以後，德京柏林為了統制食糧，及一切日用品，就採用票券制度。」到了十月，電厲風行。買麵包，是用紅券，買牛油要用黃券　肉類要靑券。還有菓醬券，肥皂券，五花十色，不帶這種票券的人，便買不到需要的東西。食物都寫好五十瓦或一百瓦字樣，照着券面切取。券的有效期間，是一星期。每天一截，看看要用完時，人人眞有一點發極的樣子。</p>
<p>雞蛋自十月以來，有很多人是嘗不到了，有錢也沒用。倒是富人貧人一樣看待，可以說是德國式的共產主義。</p>
<p>一個月一雙鞋一切都要票券，買手巾，衣服，皮鞋亦然，允其可笑的，是買鞋子，一個月只買一隻，兩個月才可以買到一　。</p>
<p>胸際的夜光章因爲防備空襲，實行燈火管制之時，街中完全黑暗，但行人爲避免互相衝突起見，多備有徽章，上塗燐光的夜光塗料，懸於胸際，和夜光　一般。夜光之花，作爲路人裝　，倒也別有風光。</p>
<p>夜間不賣報紙</p>
<p>報紙在日間賣完</p>
<p>，夜間不賣，一般市民對政治外交非常關心，在工作的女僕，往往一邊走着，一邊看報。她們不像從前的愛看小說，而在想知道戰爭和外交的新聞。她們想知道，還是戰爭，還是和平，還是張伯倫，或是誰人，」她們對於希特勒的演說，很想知道張伯倫的回答。但是德國的報紙，對於英國的回答，一字也不提及。只載着各中立國對於希特勒的演說是怎樣的予以贊成歡迎罷了。</p>
<p>歐戰展開中兩雄爭長</p>
<h3>冒牌的貨　—購買者須多多意—</h3>
<p>目前市塲充斥着冒牌貨。對於這些貨，如果同胞有點鑑別能力，也可以分別出，而不致購買。現在，根據我們所集的材料，把它的特徵告訴大家：</p>
<p>一，幾乎每種商標多有某方的象徵畫，常畫很鮮紅的旭日，或用畫表示其威力。如大星牌便是畫一着西裝之女人，足踏地球之東北角（即我東北四省之地位）高舉雙手向所畫之五角星追求。</p>
<p>二，有反宣傳之圖畫，像「鼎華牌」之鼎華圖即是反宣傳的好例，裏面給兩個軍人，拿着橫放的中國地圖，在軍人側旁的鼎上，有岳飛的「還我河山」叫字作爲香烟一樣佈置着：表示還我河山有如白烟一樣渺茫，烟消雲散，不過是夢想而己；有一些火柴，還印上一南北統一」的口號。</p>
<p>三，商標中往往含有麻醉意味，像多數繪着古今美人，壽星，古代貴人的生活，皇帝登朝等做商標的內容，用意在麻醉，陳化，腐化我們的思想</p>
<p>四，商標文字不通，如「雙金馬」寫成「金雙馬」，把四十一、碼寫成英「碼41」，這分明非我國慣用，而帶有某國文法氣味的。</p>
<p>五，商標無實業部註冊號數，只有NO，無數目在後面，如東方大港牌。</p>
<p>六，從商標紙有幾個很易分別的地方：一，紙質比外貨劣；二，墨油可滲透紙背；三，顏色少鮮明；四，有金水塗的邊，以手輕抹，金水即被抹去。</p>
<p>以上，只從商標方面看，至於從廠號看，也可看到。</p>
<p>七，冒牌的貨廠號名稱多用什麼「日新增」「日新昶」等怪名，廠名字數常是奇數，如什麼衡元盛，大新振等，又在廠之下常用棉布號之稱，在我國是少見的。</p>
<p>八，廠址多半在上海，且多爲閘北柳營路等。</p>
<p>不過，奸商是異常狡猾的，一經揭發他的假招牌後立即又改換了，最近發現一疋布或一只洋紗常常有六七種招牌，有些奸商根本不要商標，由此證明單由商標鑑別是不够的。比較可靠的還是從貨的質料上去視察，貨質低劣，不耐用，至易褪色，像最近冒充的丹士林布便有這個情形。</p>
<h3>名人軼事　馮玉祥將軍</h3>
<p>— 寒若</p>
<p>前幾年軍事委員會副委員長在泰山養疴時，適當國聯派李頓調查團來華。調查團道經泰安時，復往泰山遊玩了幾天，不知道那位團員失去了一根「司的克」於是就責問泰安縣長，要縣長負責找尋，縣長無奈，將當時的轎伕押起來尋找，馮將軍聽見了，登時大怒，馬上寫信，給縣長周百鍠，說他不明事理，不該答應替調查團我手杖，理由是（一）手杖是隨身之物，縱然失去，亦是自不小心，（二）調査團無法證明手杖是在泰山失去的。調查團久聞他老先生大名，很想見他一見，就請招待員去通知他，豈知他一律擋駕，說病了不能見客，傍人說：「馮先生，你身體很好，爲什麼不見這高貴的調查團呢」？他說：「中國有這樣大的地方，有這樣多的人，有外侮不加抵抗，等到失去國土，向人家去乞憐，我是一個身强力壯的軍人，而不能執干戈以衛社稷，我有什麼臉面去見人呢？同時李頓調查團縱有所獲。亦不能主持公道，返還國土，所以我實在羞見他們一。</p>
<h3>科學人生　營養漫談</h3>
<p>— 秦</p>
<p>一個人自從脫離母胎，呱呱墮地後，就得需要食物來維持生命。每天所需要消耗的二七二八加路里的熱量，那麼要生出這許多熱量，應該喫些什麼東西呢？人體中的筋肉，肝臟，腎臟，能够發生新陳代謝的作用，纔能生出熱量，要推動新陳代謝，那原動力是生物中的蛋白質，脂肪，含水炭素三種的養分，由各項養分產生的熱量，維持人們的生命。我們每天所需要的標準食量消耗計蛋白質五二·五瓦（體重一瓩需一瓦），脂肪五〇·〇瓦，含水炭素五〇〇·〇瓦，鹽類一七·〇瓦，維他命量〇·一瓦，水二〇〇·〇瓦。假定一個人在世六十年，則所消耗的食物，計猪二〇〇頭，鷄四〇〇隻，魚五〇〇〇尾，菜蔬五六〇〇〇公斤，米一〇四〇〇公斤，糖三〇〇〇公斤，鹽五〇〇公斤，酒一五〇〇公升，水果七〇〇〇公斤，紙烟四〇〇〇〇支，水一〇〇〇〇公升。一個人需要量有這一筆數目字，纔能維持他一生的活力。我們看到了這統計，應該知所警惕，不輕易消耗，頂造糞機器之銜頭，須得幹些有裨大衆的工作，過有意義的人生纔好。</p>
<h3>醫學界的新發明——癌的檢騐法</h3>
<p>— 微</p>
<p>簡單而有效</p>
<p>癌是最難治療的一種疾病，以前檢騐病人是吾生癌手續極爲麻煩，但最近美國斐拉台爾斐亞市汀勃爾醫校敎授癌病專家格賴斯根博士發見一種嶄新的檢騐方法簡易而有實效。據說有百分之九十的確實性。其法係從動物的胎兒中採取其脺臟肝臟，提出一種特殊物質，加以特種處置，製成一種液體，對被騐者作皮下注射，如被騐病人患癌，則注射之處，即現紅色，並長出肉釘。如無癌病，則完全沒有此種徵象。</p>
<p>據博士說明，以爲癌的細胞雖和普通細胞相似，但其發育力特別旺盛，和胎兒的細胞同樣，不過發育以後，不成爲有用的組織罷了。如人患癌病則身體全部對於同種的細胞，特為敏感。故在體外，注射胎兒的細胞即起反應，而有上述的徵候云。</p>
<h3>廢物利用</h3>
<p>— 菁華</p>
<p>在物價昂貴的現在，人民生活費加重，一切都要實行節的。能够想出廢物利用，倒是很符節的的宗旨的。現在有幾個廢物，經過製造後，可以變爲有用的東西：</p>
<p>柴炭灰製鹼</p>
<p>爐子裏燒出來的柴炭灰，把它取出，用水浸之。經過一天後，把上面一層的澄淸液體洗衣，可以洗除油漬。若果把澄淸的液體煮乾，所得的結晶，就是鹼。把它溶解於水中，便成為鹼水。蠶豆殼的灰，如法製造，也能得出鹼性的物質。</p>
<p>破布蔗渣製紙</p>
<p>起先將布和蔗渣一一用水漂洗乾凈，其决用苛性鈉煮之，然後再置入臼中搗成漿狀，薄薄的鋪在竹簾上面，用火焙乾，便成爲粗紙。</p>
<p>稻草種菇</p>
<p>先把稻草桿剪碎，調和糯米漿一碗，馬糞一堆，置在盤中，周圍鑿滿小孔，日裏澆水，經過四星期，便有草菇生出。</p>
<p>廢物利用的東西很多，上面只不過舉了三個，希望各界經騐所得，多多發表。</p>
<h3>奇聞　蓄蛇捕鼠</h3>
<p>智利國的家庭中，捕鼠的工作，係由蛇担任的。這種蛇係小型蟒類，並沒有毒。在日間這種蛇類，安靜若睡狀，到了黃昏，才漸漸活潑起來，遊來遊去，找尋老鼠。該地屋內的鬥上都鑿有洞，以便牠們出入。有人去租屋子的時候，房主稱述房子的優點時，有時誇示牠們的活潑及捕鼠的能力，亦爲其國之一。</p>
<p>有一位異鄕人旅行到智利國，晚上從房間裏走下來，見一條大蛇盤據於樓梯下席上，不覺大驚，反身呼救。屋裏的人都跑了出來，以爲發生了什麽？問明情由，他們笑着說：「這不過是「批特罷」，是我們的捕鼠者。」其中一位握住牠的尾巴，將牠摔在一邊。</p>
<p>該處婦人常常把小蛇兜在裾上玩弄着，同我們兜着小貓玩弄着一樣。廣東人以蛇貓作餚　呌作龍虎會，現在智利以蛇代貓，使之捕鼠，這樣看來，不但蛇貓之味，均屬優美，且能司同樣工作，這眞奇了！</p>
<h3>來件讀了「國慶話洪門」以後</h3>
<p>— 洪鬥一份子</p>
<p>絕對秘密的洪門，世人很少有去道她的底蘊的，今公然作史地記載，雖屬片鱗一爪，而她的奮鬥精神和立塲，已和盤托出無遺；允其作者自署桑楡，無論是吾取義「失之東隅，收諸桑楡一，然顧名思義，多少含有勉勵和贊許的雅誼，凡屬洪門中人，一定受此感動，而更加興奮的，不過談到洪門和國民黨的關繫，與事實微有出入，簡單的說：國民黨的前身是同盟會，同盟會的前身是興中會，興中會就是洪門整個的組織，先總理在當時是以致公堂堂主的資格兼興中會會長呢，如國民黨「宣誓」「內外口號」「大都督」……都是沿用洪門三百年以前的舊名稱。</p>
<p>再談到有淸二百餘决戰爭，除回準兩役外，差不多都以洪門爲主動，最著者：紅花亭，大小金川，太平天國，武漢起義諸役，皆洪門都督身仟統帥，各都督因遵守洪門成功後不爭政權的信條。洪門原是「滅淸復明」「興漢滅滿」民族革命的秘密社團，民國成立，滿淸滅亡，失掉對象，似應解散，這是中外人士二十多年來一個大疑問，須知辛亥革命成功之迅速，係洪門諸先烈鑑於滿淸庸懦，頻招外侮，喪權辱國，亡在眉睫，故海內外各山頭一致動員，顚覆滿淸，僅做到初步工作而巳；壬子春，洪門大會議決，擴大「漢族」爲五族民衆（即國族）革命社團，設聯合總會於上海，推辛亥革命元動負責，（人名恕不宜布）仍本舊的組織和紀律，作新的民挨復興運動，過去「五卅」「一二八」等諸役，洪門之血與魂，自動地會作大量的貢獻，而在前錢上所流散的血與魂，正不知有多少？所謂國慶日，乃洪門的「國祭日」讀「國慶話洪門」有感，書此以寄悲憤。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Army in Northern Hunan Captures Chang'an Post, Fierce Fighting Erupts in Yueyang Suburbs, The Chinese Army Captures Putian Bridge and Continues Westward to Besiege Wuning City, Tongcheng is Surrounded, Japanese Troops in Xishan Are Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>Miluo: On the night of the 20th, the Chinese army, braving the rain, launched a two-pronged attack on Yueyang and the nearby Chang'an Post. The Japanese, numbering several hundred, were caught off guard and the Chinese army stormed in, killing many Japanese soldiers and seizing countless military supplies. The Chinese army advancing towards Yueyang had approached the suburbs by dawn on the 21st and fierce fighting had broken out. (Electric dispatch on the 21st) The Chinese army outside Yueyang in Guilin is very active. The Chinese army near Fangshan Cave constantly attacks the Japanese troops. There have been fierce battles for days. (Electric dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Changde: After the Chinese army captured the heights around Yanglin Mountain near Bailuoji a few days ago, the Japanese were extremely threatened. On the 18th, they sent more than 500 Japanese soldiers with two artillery pieces, covered by dense artillery fire, to launch fierce attacks on Yanglin Mountain, Wangjiatan, and other places, fighting back and forth with the Chinese army. The fighting was very fierce, and the two sides are still confronting each other nearby. (Electric dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Tonggu: The Chinese troops advancing towards Wuning have been fiercely attacking the southwest suburbs of Wuning for days, making considerable progress. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to the city walls. Now the Chinese army has crossed Putian Bridge west of Wuning and is advancing towards the suburbs. The Chinese army south of Wuning is also besieging Wuning City. (Electric dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Xiushui: Another good news came from Wuning. The Chinese army pursuing the Japanese troops towards Wuning crossed Putian Bridge on the 19th and took advantage of the victory to pursue the Japanese troops. On the evening of the 20th, they arrived at Chaping'ao, a key Japanese stronghold west of Wuning. Taking advantage of the dark night and heavy rain, they attacked the Japanese troops. The Japanese were caught off guard and woke up from their sleep, retreating in disarray. More than 600 Japanese soldiers were killed by the Chinese army, and more than 200 rifles, more than 20 machine guns, and countless ammunition were seized. At dawn on the 21st, the Chinese army was pursuing and wiping out the remaining Japanese troops in the suburbs of Wuning. (Electric dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Gao'an: In Wubu City, southwest of Fengxin, fierce battles have been fought between the Chinese and Japanese armies for days. After the Chinese army counterattacked and recovered the city on the 16th, the Japanese army gathered 2,000 men on the 19th and attacked the Chinese army.

<h3>Anti-American Movement in North China Rises Again</h3>
<p>Beijing: According to news from here today, the anti-American movement instigated by the Japanese in various parts of North China has risen again, such as destroying American property, posting anti-American slogans, and ignoring American protests, all of which are prominent. On September 29, the American church in Chenliu near Kaifeng, Henan, was attacked by thugs instigated by the Japanese. The Chinese staff in the church were all threatened. The American Embassy asked the Japanese to investigate thoroughly, but there has been no response. In addition, the Japanese forced the American church's building at Xingshan Station (transliteration) on the Pinghan Railway in Hebei to sell at a reduced price. The American side refused, and the wall of the church was torn down by the Japanese. As for the American Catholic school in Kaifeng, the Japanese side asked to have a Japanese person as a consultant, but the American side refused. It is still a radio station. According to the American Consul in Tianjin, Gottway, he has made verbal and written protests to the Japanese, but the result has been no direct reply. Only the British Consul said that the Japanese had expressed their apology to the authorities in the British Concession. In addition, the Chinese newspapers here not only publish very little of Grew's speech, but also what they publish is not Grew's original speech. Therefore, the newspapers here all say that Grew promised to find ways to do his best to promote relations between Japan and the United States. (AP dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Parricide Case in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The shocking parricide case involving the Zhou brothers in Shanghai was sentenced by the Special No. 1 Court yesterday. This is indeed a rare criminal case because of its extremely serious nature, shocking the entire Shanghai society. Moreover, in the current society, no one can escape from ethical relationships, so everyone has paid close attention to this major ethical change. Therefore, we should also raise it for review.</p>
<p>When judicial proceedings are underway and have not yet been sentenced, public opinion should remain silent temporarily to avoid hindering the spirit of judicial independence. Although the sentence has now been pronounced, what we want to discuss is not within the scope of legal issues. Because the country has permanent codes, as long as the evidence is conclusive, the criminals will naturally have nowhere to escape. Even if the criminals try to hide their evil deeds with their motives, their perverse and cruel acts have absolutely no justification. Not to mention that they are willing to live outside of society, society will absolutely not tolerate such crimes. Moreover, we are currently in a period of national resistance. The youth have forgotten their own position, clung to family problems, and committed such a great crime that violates the spirit of the Chinese nation. This undoubtedly shows their loss of national consciousness, so there is absolutely no doubt that such people should be subject to the most severe sanctions of national law. Now we need to discuss, beyond the legal issues, why this kind of case occurs in society? What impact will the occurrence of this kind of case have on society? How should society remedy it to avoid the recurrence of this kind of event?</p>
<p>The occurrence of this kind of case naturally indicates that there is a defect in society. In other words, the social order cannot maintain a harmonious form. The reason why the social order cannot maintain harmony is because the times have promoted the collapse of the social system, and ordinary people cannot grasp the correct point of view on things in this turbulent society, resulting in such uncharacteristic behavior. Therefore, when the social system cannot obtain a stable point and get on a track, similar cases will inevitably occur, but perhaps not as cruel as this case.</p>
<p>After the occurrence of this kind of case, society will naturally feel a negative impact. But this does not mean that the same imitation events will inevitably continue to occur in the future. However, in the social psychology, a state of general anxiety will definitely prevail, that is, everyone will have many doubts because of this case. For example, ordinary people may doubt whether the ethics that the Chinese nation has always valued can continue to be maintained in the future? Or because the two unfilial sons in this case have both received school education, so they doubt whether the national education, an important facility of the state, has already declared bankruptcy? Or even because the method of crime in this case is the application of electric current, they doubt whether science is the source of evil? The more developed science is, will the more social evils increase?</p>
<p>In fact, the above doubts are superfluous. First, the ethical relationship will naturally not be abolished as long as the family system has not been eliminated. On the one hand, Chinese society's ethics pay great attention to reciprocity. For example, loyalty and filial piety are mentioned in the same breath as benevolence and love, which indicates that the ethical concept has a tendency to be revised with the progress of the times. On the other hand, Chinese law also respects ethical concepts to a considerable extent, so under the dual relationship of the revision of the concept itself and legal protection, ethics will never fail to continue to be maintained. Second, education should certainly bear considerable responsibility for the behavior of youth, but school education only accounts for one part of education. Zhou Zi's murder of his father cannot be blamed on school education. However, the powerlessness of the school's influence, which cannot guide him to good, is indeed also a fact. Therefore, the question for the future lies only in how the power of education should be strengthened, and it is not necessary to fundamentally doubt the ineffectiveness of education. Third, science itself has no so-called merit or demerit, but depends on how humans apply it. If the defects of society have appropriate ways to correct them, then the development of science is still on track.</p>
<p>In short, a defect occurred in society, causing a portion of the people to lose their rationality and cannot grasp the correct point of view on things. This is the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>How to eliminate the recurrence of this kind of cruel case, the fundamental key is of course the transformation of the social system. Temporary palliative measures must, on the one hand, strengthen the power of the law, and on the other hand, strengthen the role of education. The current education certainly cannot be regarded as sound, but one of the so-called unsound signs is that it often places all the problems that have always been considered difficult to discuss on the list of things not to be discussed. For example, the ethical problem, how to grasp it, educators often avoid reviewing it, so that there is a lack of considerable understanding of the section on what is right and wrong, perhaps this is the fundamental reason for indirectly encouraging evil, which is very worthy of reflection by educators. In addition, there is one point, that is, society is very likely to regard parricide cases as material for jokes recently, and some people will definitely compile materials such as novels, music, and even dramas and movies. We believe that a form of encouraging good and punishing evil will certainly be adopted. But we should know that there is a principle in education, that is, showing people evil examples is enough to arouse the motivation to do evil. So, it is better to teach everyone to "care for flowers and trees" than to write "no picking flowers" in the park. Similarly, it is also doubtful what effect it has to vividly depict and portray a social evil. We cannot but pay considerable attention to this point.</p>
<h3>After the Signing of the Tripartite Agreement, the Situation in Southeastern Europe Changes, Soviet-Turkish Friendship Is Not Affected in the Slightest, The German Route to the Balkans Is Blocked</h3>
<p>Paris: The arguments of the newspapers here all believe that the tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey will produce the following results: (1) A rapid improvement in Italian-Turkish relations; (2) The possibility of a final compromise between the Soviet Union and Turkey; (3) The blockage of the German route to the Balkans. "Le Petit Parisien" reported that Italy now feels that the neutral Balkan group can resist the oppression of the Soviet Union and limit the expansion of its power. Italy and Turkey have the same position on this Balkan defense policy. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Capital of Turkey: Foreign Minister Saracoglu recently returned here from the Soviet Union and immediately issued a statement to the press, saying, "I went to Moscow this time and held talks with the Soviet authorities in a friendly environment, which made the original ties between the two countries closer. I am very happy. I had a very good impression when I departed from Moscow to return to my country. I believe this trip will be of great benefit. Both sides have taken this opportunity to reiterate their friendship, and we should continue to talk in the future." (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu told the press today that the door to continued negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey has not been closed, but the date cannot be determined. He believes that the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey has no effect on the friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Paris: According to informed sources here, Germany has used its power to force the Soviet Union to put forward demands in southeastern Europe in an attempt to undermine the establishment of a mutual assistance treaty between Britain, France, and Turkey. But as a result, Berlin only caused the Soviet-Turkish talks to stop halfway. It is heard that in the tripartite mutual assistance treaty between Britain, France, and Turkey, a clause allowing Turkey not to engage in military intervention against the Soviet Union was already included in the initial draft. When Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu first decided to talk with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov in Moscow, he cited this clause to discuss it with Molotov and planned to get the Soviet Union to agree with Turkey's Balkan policy. It is unexpected that Germany wanted to obtain substantial interests in southeastern Europe to compensate for the interests Germany was forced to give up in the north. The Soviet Union, at the request of Berlin, planned to expand the Soviet-Turkish agreement to the aspects required by Germany. One of the most important points was the closure of the Tatar Strait. Although Turkey wanted to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union at this point, it had to stop negotiations. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Current Relations Between the Soviet Union and Germany Cannot Be Alienated by Britain and France - Moscow Newspaper Publishes Editorial -</h3>
<p>Moscow News published an editorial today reviewing the Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement. The newspaper stated, "The Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement we publish today is a document with extremely important political implications. According to this agreement, if the actions of a certain European power cause a war in the Mediterranean, forcing Turkey to be drawn into the vortex, Britain and France will provide Turkey with assistance. On the other hand, if war breaks out in the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey will provide Britain and France with the same assistance. At the same time, if Britain and France start fighting in order to fulfill their guarantees to Romania and Greece, Turkey must also provide Britain and France with assistance. However, if Turkey's actions will lead to war against the Soviet Union, Turkey may not have to fulfill its promises. This decision, the negotiations completed by Britain, France, and Turkey, is a continuation of the unfinished talks during the spring. In May, Turkey, France, and Turkey established a mutual assistance agreement in principle regarding wars in the Mediterranean. This preliminary agreement has now been transformed into a permanent agreement.</p>
<p>"Since the establishment of this agreement in principle, the international situation has undergone great changes. Britain and France have become belligerents. Given the current new situation, the Anglo-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement has occupied an extremely important position. The British and French newspapers expressed great satisfaction with this agreement, pointing to it as clear evidence of the consolidation of the Allied position. It is also noteworthy that when this agreement was signed, General Weygand, the commander of the French garrison in Syria, and General Wavell, the commander of the British Near East Defense Forces, both personally went to the Turkish capital to negotiate with the Turkish General Staff. Britain and France's emphasis on Turkey stems from the importance of Turkey's military position. Although a certain situation has made people believe that British and French foreign policy is not limited to establishing an agreement with Turkey. British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in a speech to Parliament that the Anglo-French-Turkish talks had ended three weeks ago, and the reason for the delay in the mutual assistance agreement was due to the negotiations between the Turkish Foreign Minister and the Soviet authorities in Moscow. Mr. Zhang also pointed out the hope for the signing of the Soviet-Turkish Mutual Assistance Agreement, but given the contradiction between the terms of the Soviet-Turkish agreement and Turkey's obligations to the Anglo-French-Turkish agreement, this hope is impossible. From Mr. Zhang's speech, it can be seen that the British and French diplomatic circles firmly believe that the Soviet-Turkish agreement does have a chance of being established. At the same time, the British and French newspapers all pointed to the Anglo-French-Turkish agreement as a touchstone of German-Soviet friendship. All of this shows that someone is planning to alienate Germany and the Soviet Union. Obviously, this plan is to promote the establishment of parallel agreements between the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Britain, France, and Turkey, and to lead the Soviet Union to join the group against Germany and the enemies of Britain and France in the Mediterranean region. In order to be loyal to its peaceful policies and protect the national interests of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has made timely and accurate estimates of the diplomatic actions of Britain and France, which gamble on Soviet-Turkish friendship. The clear and firm position of the Soviet Union has completely failed the "clever" plan to incite German-Soviet ill feelings. Undoubtedly, the new Anglo-French-Turkish agreement has promoted a new equilibrium in the Mediterranean. Since the Soviet Union is the largest power in the Black Sea, it must pay close attention to all actions related to the Black Sea. The Anglo-French-Turkish agreement does not affect the direct interests of the Soviet Union. Turkey's obligations have been clearly stated in the annex to the agreement. Turkey does not participate in any actions that could cause war against the Soviet Union. "The Anglo-French-Turkish agreement cannot be regarded as an instrument of peace. The agreement proves that Britain and France have dragged Turkey into the path of war. According to this agreement, Turkey must assist Britain and France in fighting against Germany and Italy. It is said that the Soviet Union will suffer losses due to the Anglo-French-Turkish agreement, which is absolutely untrue. The Soviet Union did not participate in the belly agreement, and still maintains its neutrality and freedom. From the standpoint of maintaining peace, this is a good phenomenon. However, in Turkey's case, it is another matter. The obligations assumed by Turkey will affect its policies in the near future. In any case, the Soviet Union does not need to express regret for what has happened." (TASS dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Rome. Various newspapers recently carried news from Finnish capital stating that the demands made by the Soviet government to Finland are more significant than generally expected. For example, the cession of the port of Viborg in eastern Finland is one end of it. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>London. Regarding the situation between Finland and the Soviet Union, the news received here from Finland is not enough to make people feel relieved. Observing various signs, the country is already ready and determined to maintain independence at any cost. In addition, as winter approaches, the climate and geography of Northern Europe are conducive to defense. It is firmly believed that if the Soviet Union does invade, it will be difficult to drive straight in. For this reason, after the Finnish representative Basikivi returns to Moscow tomorrow, he will try to find a compromise solution. However, if the Soviet Union rejects it, he is also prepared to deal with all incidents. If war is inevitable, the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula can provide Finland with military equipment, but they will not provide direct military assistance. In Finland, there is hope that a more powerful country will come to help. This layer will cause extremely subtle problems along the Baltic Sea, because Germany and the Soviet Union are in a position of conflicting interests in this corner of Europe. If other countries intervene, it will make the collusion between Germany and the Soviet Union even closer, which is well understood by Britain and France. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>German-Soviet Economic Talks - Compromise Reached in Principle - Details to be Discussed</h3>
<p>Moscow. The German economic delegation, led by Dr. Schnur, an economic expert from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came here to negotiate with Soviet Foreign Trade People's Commissar Mikoyan to discuss the promotion of trade between the two countries. It has lasted for two weeks. According to well-informed sources here, this conversation has made significant progress, and the two sides have reached a compromise in principle. In the future, various details will be determined. It is expected that it will take another week to establish an agreement. It is heard that both Germany and the Soviet Union are willing to buy goods from each other but are unwilling to sell goods, which is unexpected by the general public. The Soviet government has also made a list of the machinery and industrial equipment that the country wants to order from Germany. Therefore, some representatives of the German delegation are preparing to return to their country in order to allocate this order to domestic factories. As for what kind of raw materials the Soviet Union can supply to Germany, the outside world does not know. It is rumored that the Soviet government has promised to supply Germany with all of its production, except for domestic consumption. This promise seems very generous on the surface, but it is still empty in practice. According to the official statistics published before the mobilization of the Red Army, the production of general raw materials in the Soviet Union is not enough to meet domestic consumption. As for the domestic production situation after the mobilization, the official has not yet published any figures. In terms of Germany, in order to continue the war, it is eager to purchase 2 million tons of manganese and 2 million tons of kerosene from the Soviet Union. There are many manganese mines in the Soviet Union, but the pure manganese content of its ore is very thin, and most of it has not yet been developed, so it is difficult to export in large quantities for a while. As for 2 million tons of kerosene, it is equivalent to the total export volume of the Soviet Union last year. Since the mobilization of the Red Army, the domestic demand for kerosene has increased, and the export volume this year must be reduced accordingly. In addition, the tractors used in rural areas also need gasoline. The government has recently requisitioned a large amount of gasoline for rural use, which will also have an impact on the export volume of kerosene. In addition, Germany heard that it hopes that the Soviet Union will immediately supply the country with various raw materials, and not be satisfied with how it can supply them in the future. Because of these reasons, most of the German delegation's representatives often travel between Berlin and Moscow, hoping to find a solution to this difficult problem. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Germany Intensifies Diplomatic Activities - Papen Returns to Berlin - Long Talk with Hitler</h3>
<p>Berlin. According to authoritative sources here, after Britain and France decided to continue the war, the talks between Germany and the Soviet Union will be intensified in a diplomatic way. There is also the same exchange of views between Berlin and Rome. People in Berlin believe that Romania's attitude will not be affected by the British, French, and Turkish publics, because the guarantee given to Romania by the United Kingdom this spring is only one-sided in nature. The Romanian government has repeatedly stated that it will not become a bilateral agreement, and at the same time, the political and economic relations between Germany and Romania have become closer recently. (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin. German Ambassador to Turkey Papen was summoned back to his country to report and arrived in Berlin last night.

<p>Basel, Switzerland. The "National Daily" here stated that "After German Ambassador to Turkey Papen returned to Berlin, he immediately paid a visit to the head of Hitler, and talked with each other for several hours. The country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is extremely concerned about the signing of the Mutual Assistance Deed by the three countries of Britain, France, and Turkey, and said that this move has created a new situation. Even if the Soviet Union and Turkey continue to negotiate in the future, there is no way to influence it. In addition, the general public in Germany feels extremely dissatisfied that Turkey has allowed Britain to manipulate it." (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Quiet on the Western Front - Only Reconnaissance Teams Active on the Front Line - Germany Denies Large-Scale Offensive</h3>
<p>London. According to war reports from both France and Germany, the situation on the Western Front was relatively quiet today.

<p>Berlin. Regarding the French allegations that the German army recently advanced to the Western Front and adopted a large-scale offensive, the person in charge here yesterday met with foreign reporters and added that all the facts can detail the war report issued by the German army the day before. France spread this news, probably because the German army progressed rapidly, making the French army had to abandon the land it had previously occupied. Moreover, the German war report has already stated that no fierce battles have occurred on the Western Front so far. (Haitong dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Paris. The French artillery yesterday fired at the German mountain positions between the Moselle and Peer villages, attempting to expand the "no-man's land" and prevent the German army from reorganizing its newly occupied areas. It is said that when the French army retreated earlier, the German army used motorcycle units to take the opportunity to attack, but was repelled by the French army. The climate on the front line is very bad, with heavy rain, but the defense on both sides is still very strict. There are no air battles. Although the German side claims victory, the French army said that all the key points in the Walter Tall Forest, and the southwest and northwest of Saarlouis, are still in the hands of the French army. The new areas acquired by the German army have no strategic value. (Associated Press dispatch on the 21st)</p>

After the two sides exchanged fire, the hull of the German submarine was pierced by shells. At that time, a British destroyer suddenly arrived. Because the hull of the German submarine had been destroyed, it could not dive into the sea and had to be disposed of by the British destroyer. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>Germany Warns Neutral Ships - Not to Be Escorted by British and French Warships - Not to Be Escorted by British and French Warships</h3>
<p>Brussels, Belgium. German Ambassador Schwander visited Foreign Minister Spaak today for consultations. The details of the discussions were not disclosed.

The "Electrical News" said, "The Dutch government should follow the precedent of 1914 to 1918 and never accept this suggestion. If necessary, the Dutch government should escort Dutch merchant ships with its own warships." The newspaper continued, "Belgium's view is also the same. Belgian officials have said that Germany's attitude is completely in line with wartime international maritime law." (Haitong dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Talks About Territorial Waters - The Boundary Can Extend from Three Miles to Hundreds of Miles from the Shore</h3>
<p>Hyde Park City, USA. After President Roosevelt ordered yesterday to prohibit submarines of all belligerent countries from entering US territorial waters, he issued a statement saying that the boundary of territorial waters can extend from three miles from the shore to hundreds of miles, depending on the situation. As far as submarines of belligerent countries are concerned, this boundary is three miles, but our country's patrol fleet, whose duty is to maintain neutrality, has a much larger scope of territorial waters, roughly equivalent to the security zone delineated by the Panama Declaration (i.e. the declaration issued by the Pan-American Conference). In short, the breadth of the scope of territorial waters should be based on maintaining security and neutrality. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Ambassador Kuo's Statement: China's Stance Remains Unchanged; Cole's Suggestion of Peace is Baseless; Grew's Remarks Sufficient to Awaken the Japanese People</h3>
<p>London. Ambassador Kuo Tai-chi, China's envoy to the United Kingdom, told a Reuters correspondent that the Japanese-spread rumor that British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, had suggested peace terms in Chongqing, served a different purpose and was entirely baseless. The Japanese side has been releasing peace feelers for some time, but China has never changed its position. China believes that peace is impossible unless the Japanese troops withdraw from Chinese territory. As China has recently repelled the Japanese offensives in Hunan and Shanxi provinces, achieving great victories, it will naturally not change its position. Responsible circles in London also indicated that the Japanese news was purely fabricated. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>London. A Reuters correspondent recently asked Chinese Ambassador to the UK Kuo Tai-chi for his opinion on the frank remarks made by US Ambassador to Japan Grew regarding US-Japan relations. Kuo said that in his view, Ambassador Grew had done the Japanese people a real service of friendship. The Japanese people, like the German people, are never allowed to know the truth. Now Grew has made remarks that are endorsed by Washington, which should awaken the Japanese people from the delusion of a fool's paradise. London officials have not yet received a report from the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, so they are not commenting on Grew's remarks at this time. However, they acknowledge that if the reported remarks are indeed accurate, then this is a most important event. Circles concerned with the Far East generally believe that the US government, in view of the upcoming negotiations on renewing the US-Japan commercial treaty, wishes to give Japan a clear warning about the US attitude towards Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia."

<h3>Nomonhan: Negotiations Concluded; Japanese and Soviet Armies Announce: On-Site Negotiations Detailed</h3>
<p>Changchun. The Kwantung Army authorities, in the name of the "Press Officer," announced on the 21st the details of the negotiations between the Japanese and Soviet armies regarding the Nomonhan Incident after the armistice agreement was concluded on September 15. After the conclusion of the Moscow armistice agreement regarding the Nomonhan Incident on September 15, the Japanese military authorities immediately began negotiations with the Soviet Mongolian military committee at the site, proceeding with the armistice affairs in succession. Now, on October 21, the on-site affairs have ended. During the period of negotiations on the frontline, negotiations between the two sides on the implementation of the armistice, the recovery of corpses, and the exchange of prisoners of war all progressed smoothly, and were implemented according to the resolutions. Therefore, since the end of September, negotiations have been conducted on the handling of prisoners and fugitives, as well as the return of other detainees unrelated to this incident. By October 21, the negotiations had stalled. Thereupon, the Japanese military authorities decided to avoid delaying the on-site affairs and entrusted the resolution of these issues to other negotiations, thus ending the on-site negotiations. According to this decision, although the Nomonhan Incident was only a border incident, due to its inherent characteristics, it also caused considerable shock both domestically and abroad. Furthermore, due to the characteristics of modern warfare, both sides suffered great sacrifices, making people deeply feel the importance of securing national borders and defending national territory. Now that the on-site negotiations have come to an end, we have new feelings, and we want to express our deepest gratitude to the fighting soldiers and the loyal souls who died for their country. Furthermore, a quick glance at the current European situation makes us even more acutely aware of the urgency of strengthening our national defense capabilities. The Japanese military authorities are determined to advance toward the national defense line based on the fundamental meaning of the joint defense of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, so as to live up to the enthusiasm of the people in the rear. (Daimeng Electric, 21st)</p>
<p>Changchun. The on-site negotiations on the Nomonhan Incident ended today. The Japanese and Soviet sides have not yet reached a consensus on the handling of prisoners and fugitive soldiers, as well as the method of returning other detainees unrelated to this incident. It has now been decided that, with the understanding of the representatives of the two armies, the resolution of these issues will be entrusted to the upcoming diplomatic negotiations between Japan, Manchukuo, and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura Explains Diplomatic Policy; Aiming to Build a New Order</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Foreign Minister Nomura visited the Ise Grand Shrine today after taking office as Foreign Minister. During the train ride, he gave a statement to reporters, stating briefly that he intends to exchange frank and candid views on the situation in East Asia with US Ambassador to Japan Grew as soon as possible. The Foreign Minister also announced that he will devote himself to the following matters: (1) Establishing normal relations with the Soviet Union; (2) Resolving the China Incident; (3) Adhering to the Anti-Comintern Pact. The friendly relations with Germany and Italy will be maintained as before. Regarding the resolution of the China Incident, it will begin with assisting the "New Central Government" of China. This government will be established soon, and Japan will assist its sound growth based on the policies already decided, and intends to fully consider China's actual situation and the general situation, so as not to leave any regrets. The Japanese government hopes to organize China's "New Central Government" as soon as possible, and hopes that it can have sufficient power and gain the trust of all of China. Japan's efforts to resolve the China Incident have been hampered by the direct or indirect assistance of various third countries to the Chiang Kai-shek regime. As a result of the outbreak of the European war, the countries that aided Chiang are now unable to continue providing assistance. The real purpose of Japan in resolving the China Incident is the establishment of a New Order in East Asia. As for the New Order in East Asia that we desire, it is not an order that excludes foreigners, as some third countries suspect, but an order that will enable East Asia to make an effective contribution to world peace and development in its position. The Japanese nation's determination to establish this order is not fragile, and cannot be changed by the intervention of one or several countries. In fact, it is extremely firm, with a "burn the boats" mentality. Therefore, the key to Japan's adjustment of relations with third countries lies in understanding the above two points. The Foreign Minister also mentioned relations with Britain and France, saying that the key to adjusting relations between Japan and Britain and France lies in Britain and France fully understanding the great significance of the New Order in East Asia and cooperating with Japan. The Foreign Minister also mentioned the round-table conference between Britain and Japan on the Tianjin Incident, saying that Japan's intentions have been notified to Britain in the recent Tokyo conference. Future developments depend entirely on Britain's ability to understand Japan's position. The Foreign Minister expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the Gulangyu issue, saying that since the public concession in the area can be avoided from becoming a base for anti-Japanese activities, the situation in the area can naturally return to normal. The Foreign Minister then mentioned US Ambassador Grew's return to his post and his frank expression of the US attitude toward Japan's actions in China, saying that he wished to exchange views with him on the situation in the United States and East Asia as soon as possible. We are undertaking the great responsibility of building East Asia with a long-term vision and firm determination, so we ask the United States to correctly understand this purpose and the determination of Japan. What the United States is most concerned about at the moment is how to prevent the catastrophe in Europe from spreading to the Americas. Japan shares the same feeling and is working hard to prevent the European war from extending to Japan. The United States may be fully aware of Japan's position, so the United States and Japan should cooperate with each other to protect peace in the Pacific. The Foreign Minister also mentioned the Soviet Union, saying that his policy is to adjust relations between the Soviet Union and Japan. The peaceful resolution of border issues and other outstanding issues has greatly improved relations between the two countries. Since the signing of the Nomonhan armistice agreement, the exchange of corpses and prisoners of war has been implemented. The joint demarcation commission will be organized soon to jointly survey the disputed border near Nomonhan. As for Japan's relations with Germany and Italy, some aspects are misunderstood. Some believe that the Anti-Comintern Pact has become a piece of waste paper after the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. However, Japan has always regarded the Anti-Comintern Pact as the foundation of its national policy, so Japan's relations with Germany and Italy are not affected in the slightest. Finally, the Foreign Minister expressed his views on the European war, saying that although Hitler has the desire for peace, the war will inevitably be prolonged due to the Soviet Union's advances in the Baltic Sea and other factors. It is difficult to speculate on the future development of Europe. (Reuters, 21st)</p>

<h3>Various Parties in Chongqing Express Pleasure with Ambassador Grew's Speech; Officials Believe it is of Great Significance; All Newspapers Give it High Praise; US Public Opinion Also Unanimously Commends it</h3>
<p>Chongqing. US Ambassador to Japan Grew's speech in Tokyo exposing Japanese crimes was published in newspapers on this weekend, and people throughout Chongqing were generally pleased. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited a certain authoritative expert on international affairs this afternoon to ask for his views on Grew's speech. He said the following points. The expert first stated that Grew's speech was of great significance. Since Japan began its war of aggression against China, the interests and rights of the United States in China have been continuously undermined and occupied. The US government has repeatedly protested to the Japanese side, but the Japanese government has never paid attention. It was not until December 31 last year that the US government made a general protest resolving to safeguard its rights and interests and protect justice. However, due to Japan's barbarity, it did not produce any results. Therefore, Ambassador Grew decided to stand on the position of the Nine-Power Treaty, and publicly clarified to the Japanese people with a sincere and straightforward attitude the determination of the United States to maintain its original position in the Far East, and exposed the Japanese government's various crimes of ignoring treaty obligations, thereby urging the Japanese people to have a thorough understanding and awareness of the United States' consistent policy in the Far East and the absurdity of its government's measures. As for Japan's repeated claims of building the so-called "New Order in East Asia," Ambassador Grew also gave it the most fierce criticism based on the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. The so-called New Order in East Asia by Japan is indeed another name for dominating East Asia. This is in fact a violation of the true spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. The main points of the Nine-Power Treaty are the Open Door Policy, equal opportunity, and respect for China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity. Japan is also one of the signatory countries, but now it blatantly disregards the constraints of the treaty, interferes with American interests in China, and further wants to realize its dream of monopolizing the Far East. Therefore, the United States resolutely opposes and does not recognize its establishment of the (New Order in East Asia). The expert finally said that the US Ambassador also severely condemned Japan's arbitrary bombing in China, regardless of humanitarianism. Not only have the lives and property of American expatriates suffered significant damage, but also the various inhumane abuses suffered by Chinese civilians have angered the American people who have a sense of justice. In summary, Ambassador Grew's speech was based on humanitarianism, maintaining American interests and rights in the Far East, and respecting the principles of China's territorial and administrative integrity and sovereignty. (Telegraph, 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to official sources here today, US Ambassador to Japan Grew's remarks in Tokyo merely express the United States' historical friendship with China, and at the same time express the United States' firm attitude toward its rights and interests in the Far East. Even more so, it expresses the United States' feeling toward acts of aggression and its determination not to recognize the conquest of land by force. Moreover, on December 31 of last year, the United States sent a note to Japan, but Japan has not yet responded. Later, due to the increasingly confrontational relations between Japan and the United States, the US government began to terminate the US-Japan commercial treaty. Ambassador Grew's speech today is merely a restatement of the position already stated in the various notes sent by the United States to Japan. Furthermore, all the newspapers here have given Ambassador Grew's remarks large-character headlines and attached lengthy commentaries. According to the Central Daily News, Grew's speech has two meanings. On the positive side, it reiterates the US position of not recognizing the occupation of land by force. On the negative side, it refutes various Japanese theories of aggression, such as the "New Order in East Asia." At the same time, Grew has made it clear to Japanese propagandists that the world is not easily deceived, and that their various propaganda intended to confuse the public has been a complete failure. The newspaper concluded that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States' attitude has so far only been expressed in verbal and written statements. What the world hopes and expects now is action from the United States. The fact that the United States is now prepared for practical action has aroused the supreme admiration of the Chinese people. The Ta Kung Pao, on the other hand, believes that "the bright era of the Pacific has arrived." It said that the United States has fully recognized the truth in the Far East, and has decided not to be an accomplice any longer, but to punish the ringleader. According to the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper Xinhua Daily, the economic lifeline of Japanese imperialism is entirely in the hands of the United States. Therefore, it is as easy as turning one's hand to restrain Japan by imposing sanctions on Japan by the United States. In other words, the United States only needs not to renew its commercial treaty with Japan, stop trading with Japan, and ban arms trade, and it will be able to control Japan's fate. In addition to this, if it can continue to lend money to China, it will be able to promote the early restoration of peace and order in the Far East. The Chinese Army's newspaper, the Saodang Bao, said that Grew's speech has further strengthened our determination to fight to the end, and has strengthened our belief that "final victory must belong to us." Although we have formulated a policy of obtaining victory purely through our own efforts, we also believe that the sympathy and spiritual assistance of foreign countries have great power. The Shishi Xinbao stated that Grew's speech was a major blow to the Japanese. In order to eliminate the atmosphere of the "New Order in East Asia," we hope that the United States will use great determination and strong action to support the Nine-Power Treaty, because the Nine-Power Treaty and the "New Order in East Asia" cannot coexist. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>New York. The US newspapers unanimously praised US Ambassador to Japan Grew's remarks that the US opposes the "New Order in East Asia," and regarded it as a clear warning to Japan. The New York Sun said that we should make it clear to Japan that Grew's criticism of Japan fully represents US public opinion. What the Japanese military has done in China has not been interfered with in the past, but it seems that it should not be tolerated any longer today. The general opinion in the United States is that enlightened people in Japan should now try to limit the actions of their warlords. The New York Times placed Grew's remarks on the front page with a very large headline, "Grew's Warning to Japan," and a sub-headline, "Signals Further Action by US to Curb Japanese Militarists." The New York Herald Tribune also published Grew's speech in a prominent position, with the large headline "Grew Warns Japan" and sub-headlines such as "US Indignant at Japan's Actions." The New York Daily Mirror's headline was, "Grew's Speech Has Shaken the Japanese Political World." (Associated Press, 21st)</p>

<h3>Situation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania Before the Outbreak of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bo Ming from the London Times</p>
<p>This article describes the situation in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania in great detail, but it was written before Germany invaded Poland. Therefore, its arguments no longer align with the current situation. After the Soviet Union and Germany divided Poland, the three countries, under the pressure of the Soviet Union's power, signed various treaties with the Soviet Union, sacrificing many significant interests in exchange for temporary security. Their planned strategies have all become impossible to implement. The rapid changes in the international situation this year can be described as unprecedented. The countries that are most affected are the smaller ones. Currently, negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland are underway, and it is not known what the outcome will be. However, it can be predicted that small countries will always suffer some losses and make significant concessions in order to avoid disaster. Even the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula, as well as Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium, are now uneasy, fearing that Germany will violate their neutrality, enter their territory under false pretenses, and attack the British and French armies. In short, the word "trust" has completely disappeared from international relations. Not only small countries, but even large countries cannot rest easy.</p>
<p>Translator</p>
<p>Latvia and Estonia signed non-aggression pacts with Germany and obtained beneficial compromises. The German government initially wanted to conclude separate bilateral agreements with the two countries but ultimately agreed that the contents of the two agreements should be the same and signed simultaneously. Therefore, these two Baltic states have given Germany two new bilateral agreements, without abandoning their principle of maintaining an independent and united stance in the world.</p>
<p>Latvia and Estonia were born together twenty years ago during the Russian split and fought side by side for the right to survive. In the earliest days, the two countries' armies were often strangely mixed together. Estonians fought in Latvian territory, and the current Latvian Foreign Minister was one of the Latvians who once fought against the common enemy in the Estonian army.</p>
<p>These twin republics, with Estonia being slightly older, were recognized de facto by Britain on May 3, 1918, and similarly by Latvia in November of the same year. However, in the following two years, the two countries continued to fight mixed battles, sometimes against invading Red Army forces, and sometimes against the remnants of the old German army—because the Germans had occupied most of the Baltic states, and the deposed German Emperor even personally visited Riga.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union signed peace treaties with Estonia and Latvia on February 2 and August 11, 1920, respectively. Apart from Brest-Litovsk, these were the first resolutions of the Soviet government. They have always maintained the foundation of their relations. The independence and borders formally recognized at that time have never been threatened. The few revolutionary attempts by internal communist elements were also easily defeated. In the early years after 1930, the two countries gradually became tired of the parliamentary system. At that time, the parliament, controlled by many inexperienced leaders of various parties, had lost its original purpose and evolved into an unhealthy focal point for constant disputes. This kind of dispute not only made the political situation lack stability and purpose but even caused serious internal strife, threatening the country. Therefore, the original leaders who fought for independence in the two countries resolutely rose up to lead again. After several years of strenuous reorganization and reform, they created their own legislative and administrative systems. These systems differed from each other in the two republics and were also different from the systems of other countries in many respects. However, they contained parliamentary elections and still had a slightly moderate dictatorial nature.</p>
<p>Latvia and Estonia seem to have no enemies in the world. Of course, they themselves are not enemies of any country. All they care about is developing their own small natural resources, sending fishing boats and merchant ships to the high seas, and promoting peaceful exchanges with neighboring countries. The last point mentioned is the most important and a necessary condition for the existence of both countries.</p>
<p>People generally call Latvia and Estonia the axis of peace in Europe, forming an obstacle between Germany and the Soviet Union with Poland and Romania. The politicians of the Baltic states never forget this point and always base their foreign policy on it, maintaining good neighborly relations with the Soviet Union and Germany, without giving any benefit to either side that would inevitably annoy the other. Even in the early years, when Germany seemed farther from the Baltic countries than it is today, the two countries did not give the Soviet Union exclusive benefits. Although they had tried to establish closer economic relations, they never considered political entanglements. Last year, the two countries declared strict neutrality, which will give them a small chance in wartime. The two countries have never seriously considered automatically joining the German side because this move would prompt the Soviet army to advance to the Baltic coast. The Baltic countries would inevitably become battlefields and be destroyed. No matter how the war progresses, if they were to join the Soviet side, it would be equivalent to allowing the Soviet army to assist in the defense of the coastline, risking the annexation of valuable seaports such as Tallinn, Riga, Ventspils, and Liepāja by the Soviet Union. However, when Germany proposed concluding non-aggression pacts, the two countries hesitated little or not at all, because these two agreements had some protective value and could not cause any harm. It was only natural that if they refused, it would inevitably provoke Germany to accuse them of favoring the Soviet Union. The two countries had already concluded several similar agreements with the Soviet Union, and this additional agreement with Germany was, at least in theory, another guarantee of neutrality.

<h3>Re-adjusting Transportation in Fujian Province; Approximately 50,000 Porters Throughout the Province, and Joint Transportation with Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Fuzhou dispatch: The authorities of Fujian Province, in order to consolidate local defense and facilitate inter-provincial transportation, have adjusted the transportation agencies throughout the province. Coastal highways have been completely destroyed, and inland highways have been expanded. Currently, this work has been completed. Transportation in coastal counties, where there are streams and rivers, is carried out by sailing ships. Roads are entirely using manpower. Therefore, the general labor force has become active. In the southern Fujian region, along the line from Fuzhou via Fuqing, Putian, to Xianyou, and from Putian via Xianyou, Hui'an, to Quanzhou, there are more than 2,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. From Putian via Xianyou, Yongchun, to Dehua, and from Quanzhou via Nan'an to Yongchun, there are more than 1,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. From Quanzhou via Tong'an, Haicheng to Zhangzhou, there are more than 3,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. In the eastern Fujian region, from Fuzhou via Lianjiang, Luoyuan, to Ningde, and from Ningde via Xiapu, Fu'an, to Fuding and Shouning, there are more than 1,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. In the northern Fujian region, from Fuzhou via Gutian to Jian'ou, there are more than 1,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. In the western Fujian region, from Changting to Ruijin, there are more than 3,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. From Yongding to Dabu, there are more than 2,000 porters traveling back and forth each day. The above numbers refer to long-distance organized porters. The numbers for short-distance unorganized porters are not included. The total number is more than double. Therefore, it is estimated that there are approximately 50,000 porters throughout the province. The average daily wage is one yuan per person, totaling 50,000 yuan. As for transportation tools, in addition to a portion carried on shoulders, the rest is carried by mules and horses or pushed by handcarts. The Provincial Military Shipping Company, in order to adapt to environmental needs, has established a manual transportation office in Fuzhou, divided into iron-shoulder and handcart departments, to manage transportation affairs in the eastern and southern Fujian regions, with the aim of facilitating commerce. As for inland transportation, Fujian-Zhejiang and Fujian-Jiangxi have direct traffic, and the business is extremely developed. They are also managed by the transportation company. The freight rate is two cents per 100 market pounds per 10 kilometers. Currently, joint water, land, and air transportation has been organized with Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces, so that goods needed to be shipped out of this province and goods needed to be shipped into this province can be smoothly transported without hindrance. Agriculture, industry, and commerce will not be affected by the sea blockade and can still progress as usual.</p>
<h3>Fake Youth League Attacked Outside the South Gate of Wuxi; Fake Captain Killed on the Spot</h3>
<p>Wuxi dispatch: At the original site of Wuxi Private Middle School outside the South Gate of Wuxi, at Yangyao Bay, there is now a fake "Youth League Volunteer Army Wuxi Branch Recruitment Office." Zhou Xiaofu, a person named Yi Xi from a former police officer, is the fake captain. At about 4:00 p.m. on the 17th, more than 50 mobile team members, carrying rifles, box cannons, and submachine guns, came from Dongting and swarmed into the fake recruitment office, opening fire. Zhou Xiaofu was shot and killed on the spot. Two other fake league members were seriously injured. By the time the nearby Japanese army and the puppet pacification team heard the news and rushed over, the mobile team had already gone far away.</p>

Lido center forward Huang Kehou was ill, and left winger Wu Qixiang had returned to his hometown, both absent, greatly affecting their strength. Xu Wenkui was also injured in the ankle by Servina's kick ten minutes after the start of the game, unable to shoot, resulting in two consecutive goals conceded in the first half, putting them at a disadvantage of 0-2. In the second half, Lido strategist Zhang Zhihe adjusted Li Yichen to the center forward position, and the offensive was greatly strengthened. Relying on the hard work of the generals, they scored three goals in a row. As a result, they won the final victory with a score of 3-2. Lido narrowly escaped alive, and the fans were all rejoiced.</p>

<p>Lost Two Goals in Penalty Kicks</p>
<p>Lido attacked against the wind. Sun Jinshun first got Qiuting's help and shot his foot. French Merchants goalkeeper Bao Saizhong caught it and threw it out. Jinshun continued to shoot several times, but ultimately failed due to Bao Saizhong's agility. French Merchants center forward Laobusi Tuofu had a shooting opportunity. Fortunately, Lu Zhong'en fell to the ground and escaped the difficulty. Cao Qiuting started from the left, and Sun Jinshun shot with iron legs, but unfortunately hit the goalpost. At 30 minutes, the city defense was tight, and Li Yichen accidentally fouled and was penalized with a penalty kick. Jiemuhuate kicked and broke the net, and the French Merchants scored first. Lido general Sun Jinshun increased his anger and went straight in, more than ten yards away from the goal, and shot hard, but Bao Saizhong was an old general after all and saved it by diving to the ground. After that, Lido had very few opportunities to attack. Before the end of the first half, he was again lightly kicked by Laobusi Tuofu, and Zhong'en watched it enter the net, unable to save it. In the first half, the French Merchants took the lead with 2-0.</p>
<p>Returning the Favor, Three in a Row</p>
<p>After the lemon, Lido's offensive was still absent. After ten minutes of stalemate, Li Yichen dribbled to the baseline, and Ke Laiduo rushed to foul and was penalized with a penalty kick. Xu Wenkui kicked and pulled back a goal. From then on, Lido's momentum greatly increased. Jinshun pounced on the enemy's formation. Xuan Qiuting passed to Wenkui, and Wenkui picked up and sent to Jinshun. Sun hooked and shot on the ground, but was caught by Bao Saizhong. French Merchants right forward Diwei Que Lin was unwilling to show weakness and shot flat with his foot, hitting Zhong'en in the chest. Zhong'en threw it out with both hands. At this time, Lido quickly replaced Li Jiang to increase the offensive. At 30 minutes, Jinshun scored with a beautiful foot, making it 2-2. Five minutes later, Lido's Zhang Mingsheng picked up and sent Qiuting. Qiuting shot from 30 yards away, and the ball went into the left corner, clear and beautiful. Lido then reversed the defeat with 3-2.</p>

<h3>Public Utility Autumn Sports Meet; Electricity Wins the Championship; Water Gets Second Place; Public Bus Third</h3>
<p>The 5th Shanghai Six Public Utility Companies Autumn Sports Meet was held at the American Boy's School yesterday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. In the 14 events, electricity relied on average talent to win nine first places and won the championship with 87 points. Water, which had won the championship in the previous four sessions, came in second with 43 points. Third place Public Bus 22 points, fourth place Telephone 12 points, fifth place Tram 5 points. Water and fire utilities got zero eggs and were at the bottom. Individual champion Water Mann Treles scored 16 points alone, runner-up Public Bus Ingelen scored 13 points, and Electric Zhang Liang and Voluo Qin Gu each scored 12 points, tied for third place. Mann Treles' shot put of 37 feet and 5 inches broke the old record of 35 feet and 5 and a half inches held by Ge Bomen, and also won the first place in the high jump. Zhang Liang won both the one-mile and three-mile long-distance races, and broke his own old record of 17 minutes and 46.4 seconds in the three-mile race, with a score of 17 minutes and 27.8 seconds. In addition, in the one-mile race walking, Electric Xu Guofu created a new record with 8 minutes and 23 seconds (the old record was 8 minutes and 24.8 seconds held by Dai Fengkang). Veteran Tao Yingjie unexpectedly came in third in the low hurdles and 440 yards. The three-mile race was created by the Chinese, which is commendable. Wang Jianwu is still strong when he is old. In addition to winning the first place in the old man's race, he also won the third place in the one-mile race walking. In the invited one-mile relay, the West Youth overwhelmed the heroes. The forward team was all long-distance running masters, but the cross-dressing short-distance running was miscalculated. The men's and women's obstacle races were the most funny, adding a lot of color to the conference.</p>

<h3>Overview of Moral Education in National Higher Education (3); Implementation of the Tutor System</h3>
<p>In the past, our country's education only focused on the transmission of knowledge and neglected moral education, so there was criticism of "teaching" but not "educating." In 1931, the League of Nations Education Inspection Team provided many opinions on our country's university education, such as: "The educational level of certain universities is actually too low. Students' past training is insufficient and they do not have the level to study at university, but they are also admitted to university. In the past, they relied on formal education, especially relying on classroom lectures, and did not pay attention to group research and tutor work, nor did they know that they should encourage students to engage in independent research. The relationship between teachers and students is not very close, so as a result, the educational efficiency and academic atmosphere of the university are harmed." In order to correct this bias and make the relationship between teachers and students close and achieve the effect of personality influence, the Ministry of Education, in reference to our country's old system of teachers and Confucian scholars and the British requirement, ordered the schools to implement it. The method is for each school to divide the students in each grade into several groups, with each group having five to fifteen people. Each group has one tutor, who is appointed by the principal to be a full-time teacher, and one chief tutor or moral education director is appointed to manage all student moral education affairs in the school. The tutor should understand the students' thoughts, behavior, academic performance, and physical and mental health, and give strict moral education to make them develop normally and cultivate a healthy personality. The tutor should record the above items in detail according to the format and report to the school and the students' parents every month. The educational administrative organs in charge may review the school report at any time. The tutor should be responsible for the students who receive training. If they make special contributions in academics or career after being in school or after graduating, the honor should be attributed to the original tutor. If there is improper behavior or incorrect thinking due to the tutor's poor moral education, the original tutor should also be jointly responsible. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Review Completed by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 21st) The Ministry of Education distributed the second batch of loan readings to students of secondary and higher vocational schools in the war zone. It is reported that the procedures have been completed. A total of 167 people have been approved for distribution after review. Loan reading certificates will be issued soon, and subsidies will be given at the discretion of the school. The deadline for reporting to the distributed schools will be set soon.</p>
<p>Qinghai Province Has Implemented Compulsory Education; Northern Route Comfort Team Visits Various Schools</p>
<p>(Xining, 18th) The Northern Route Comfort Team visited various schools in Qinghai Province on the 16th and 17th.

The provincial government plans to set up one primary school in each of the 25 counties in the province starting next year. The more problematic issues are teachers and textbooks. The primary school textbooks in the provincial capital are all handwritten. The spirit of the students' hard work is admirable.</p>

<p>The English and American Exchange Rates Continue to Fall, Hong Kong Banks Unceasingly Sell Off, HSBC's Appetite Wanes</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions saw no rise or fall in HSBC's listed prices. In the underground market, the Anglo-American exchange rate showed a relaxed trend that had persisted for days, with this trend only increasing. It is widely believed that the 5 pence mark for British gold and the 8 yuan mark for the US dollar will be easily broken in the near future. The day's trading began similarly to the previous day. Subsequently, Hong Kong banks, true to their usual style, started by heavily selling off. Only HSBC and a small number of other banks made purchases, so the rate slightly loosened at this point. Soon after, the Hong Kong banks continued to sell, and HSBC suddenly reversed its price to absorb the supply, causing the loosening trend to intensify. British gold reached 4 pence 6875, and the US dollar was at 7 yuan 8125. Unexpectedly, sellers then hesitated and stopped advancing. There was a period of calm until 11:30 AM, when Hong Kong banks sold again, and HSBC also stopped buying, causing the market to appear weak. Although Banque Belge pour l'Étranger and Banque Franco-Chinoise briefly supported the price, there were still two non-bank entities selling, so the hardest the US dollar reached was 7 yuan 875. In the end, British gold hardened further, reaching 4 pence 703125, while the US dollar closed at 7 yuan 84375. As for futures trading, although there were transactions, the trend was uniform. Half-day trading was quite active.</p>
<p>American Merchants Also Sold Yesterday</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London spot rate for short-term bills was up 3125, and the long-term rate was up 125. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London bullion remained steady. Exchange rates between the British pound and the US dollar, Shanghai currency, and French franc were all flat. The US dollar against the British pound and Shanghai currency also showed no rise or fall, while the rate against the French franc was down slightly by 25. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the opening, banks' spot selling prices were 4 pence 609375 for British gold and 7 yuan 71875 for the US dollar, with no gains or losses compared to the previous closing. After the opening, Hong Kong Electric first sold, but while HSBC had an appetite, it was not as strong as the previous day, so the trend was hardening. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold to HSBC and Banque Franco-Chinoise at 4 pence 625 and 65625. At the same time, exporters sold spot US dollars to a certain bank at 7 yuan 75. Soon after, a certain bank sold US dollar futures for November to another bank at 7 yuan 625. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be down by a small 2%. Later, Hong Kong Electric continued to sell spot British gold to HSBC at 4 pence 6875. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric and a certain bank sold spot US dollars to Banque Belge pour l'Étranger and Banque Franco-Chinoise at 7 yuan 8125. The process was hardening step by step. After that, no one was selling at the above prices, and the underlying trend was slightly stabilizing. However, after 11:30 AM, Hong Kong Electric sold again, and HSBC's appetite was minimal, causing the situation to loosen further. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold to non-bank entities at 4 pence 703125, as well as spot US dollars at 7 yuan 84375 and 875. Subsequently, Chinese merchants sold US dollar futures for October to a certain bank at 7 yuan 75. Extending to the noon closing, banks' spot selling prices were 4 pence 703125 for British gold and 7 yuan 8375 for the US dollar. This month's and spot prices were the same. November British gold was at 4 pence 640625, and the US dollar was at 7 yuan 71875. In the end, compared to the previous day, the spot British pound was down by 09375, and the US dollar was up by 125. Half-day trading was quite active. Except for American merchants, other banks were all squeezing in. Chinese merchants and money changers had a slight appetite for the US dollar. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Foreign Exchange Market is Quite Stable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 21st – This morning, the foreign exchange market opened stably, with no movement in the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates. The Shanghai currency spot rate fell by 2 yuan to 320 yuan. There was no change in the quiet half-day.</p>
<p>Tianjin US Dollar Reaches Seven Yuan</p>
<p>Tianjin, 21st – Today, the foreign exchange market opened with a continued loosening. The British exchange spot rate loosened by 125 to 4 pence 25, while the US dollar spot rate rose by 25 to 7 yuan 1875. The Shanghai currency continued to fall by 2.5 yuan to 108 yuan. The "Joint Notes" underground market was down by 1 yuan to 87 yuan.</p>
<h3>More Selling Than Buying, Gold Market Plunges, Breaking the 4,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold underground market conditions were calm for three days, but the loosening foreign exchange rate made the 4,000 yuan mark unsustainable. The lowest price once appeared at 3,965 yuan. The opening price of 4,000 yuan was still the highest price of the day. Subsequently, various banks heavily sold off, immediately dropping to 3,995 yuan. However, the Hong Kong banks and a certain gold company were still buying, so the decline was contained and pulled up by 4 yuan. But after that, the Hong Kong banks stopped buying, because Hong Kong ships had weighed anchor and temporarily suspended purchases, and because it was the end of the week, positions were even more abundant. As the loosening of foreign exchange rates was difficult to stop, there was more selling than buying, and the price fell further and further, reaching 3,966 yuan at closing. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday, but there were some transactions outside the market, with the price around 3,970 yuan. About 600 taels were traded in the half-day. Gold jewelry was listed at 5 yuan lower. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Fell by 39 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial foreign exchange rates loosened, and the market was weak. The market opened 5 yuan lower. Money changers sold 20 taels to jewelry stores at 4,000 yuan. Then it fell another 5 yuan, and money changers mutually traded 10 taels at 3,995 yuan. At that time, the Hong Kong banks absorbed about 100 taels, and gold companies also came to pull up the price, but at that time, the supply from various banks was quite good, so you were 4 yuan higher. A certain jewelry store bought 30 taels from Yu Hao at 3,999 yuan. After that, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate continued to harden, and the selling trend was even stronger. Jewelry stores rushed to sell, and a certain gold company also turned from buying to selling. Because the Hong Kong banks stopped buying, the market lacked support and began to decline. The market fell 22 yuan. Jewelry stores sold 20 taels to money changers at 3,977 yuan. Later, there was a slight pause. Gold companies bought 10 taels from money changers at 3,980 yuan. Around 11:30 AM, the foreign exchange rate hardened again, causing the selling trend to resurface. Money changers frequently sold, even lowering the price by 15 yuan. Money changers mutually traded 30 taels at 3,965 yuan. Later, money changers bought 20 taels from jewelry stores at 3,966 yuan as the noon closing price. In the end, it fell by 39 yuan compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 35 yuan in the half-day. The selling price of cash gold companies was 10 yuan higher than the cash gold, and the purchase price had to be reduced by about 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Price Revised to 400 Yuan</p>
<p>Initially, major jewelry stores still listed gold jewelry for sale at 405 yuan per tael. By noon, it was listed 5 yuan lower. After that, there were no changes. Major jewelry stores revised the listed price to 400 yuan. New jewelry stores had the same price, and the purchase price was reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Decline Daily, US Dollar Notes Enter the 13 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market deteriorated further. This was because the foreign exchange rate loosened due to Hong Kong Electric's selling, the gold price suddenly fell below the 4,000 yuan mark, and the ever-present but elusive peace atmosphere suddenly became noisy again, making it even more difficult for people's minds to improve. As a result of yesterday's market, the British gold pound fell by 7 jiao, the US dollar pound fell by 2 yuan, the British gold note fell by 2 jiao, the US dollar note fell by 1 jiao 3 fen, the Hong Kong note fell by a small 5.5 fen, the Singapore note fell by 1 jiao, the Dutch note fell by 2 jiao, the Annam note fell by 8 fen, the Philippine note fell by 2 jiao, the Japanese remaining note fell by a small li, the Korean note fell by 1 fen, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The Domestic Debt Market is Gradually Rising</p>
<p>Although the securities underground market was weak in the morning, due to the buying and price-raising by many parties, there was a general follow-up in the later market opening, and the price was raised by 4 to 5 jiao. Yesterday's trading saw weakness in the morning and remained in a hovering state. The market was slightly stable at the closing. In the later market, the price had already been raised secretly, and the market price was gradually rising. The so-called peace atmosphere also took the opportunity to rise. The counter was narrow, and although it was difficult for many parties to raise prices, it was also not easy to lower prices. As a result, the market continued to rise by 3 to 4 jiao. Only the Ninety-Six was down by a small 1 jiao 5 fen. The total number of transactions was about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: China Bank held 40 shares, priced at 54 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western stock market conditions at the Public Concession were mixed, with varying prices. Trading was slightly thin due to the weekend. The recently soaring Deluge Phone stock once returned from 19 yuan to a small 17 yuan 3 jiao, with the final price at 18 yuan 2 jiao. Ewo Silk stock also fell slightly. China Reclamation and International Trust both rose slightly. Other stocks saw little change. Rubber stocks declined slightly due to weakened communications and profit-taking on many varieties.</p>
<p>London, 20th – Today's listed prices of British companies in the Far East saw mixed gains and losses in bank and rubber stocks. Mercantile Bank shares rose 2 shillings 6 pence to £7 5 shillings. HSBC shares fell by £1 each, with London-registered shares at £74 and London-registered shares at £75. Kula Clan rubber shares rose 5 pence to 16 shillings. The rest were flat.</p>
<p>London, 20th – Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained calm, with no changes in the upper and lower tranches of bonds.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Ten Count Coarse Yarn Continues to Fall by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had been falling for a week, showed a slightly stable trend yesterday. This was because some speculators believed that the price of 650 yuan had fallen enough to buy a few bales to make a profit or loss. If it fell again, they would buy more and pull it up. Once they had the opportunity to reverse the trend, they could avoid losing money. It was rumored that someone sold foreign exchange to buy cotton yarn, and another rumor said that money changers also came to speculate and buy a few bales. This temporary surge of wind temporarily suppressed the decline. However, merchants' minds were still depressed, and ships were not sailing, so traders were still taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, the market situation was slightly better, and it continued to rise after closing. However, the steps of decline were still large, and this kind of reversal was also reasonable.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened in the morning with subdued momentum, and transactions were very rare. Ordinary people who specialized in grabbing the limelight saw the situation as scattered and had no chance to take advantage of it. They ate in the market and made trouble, but it was not until 10:00 AM that the market opened, and it fell another 11 yuan. The Double Horse price was 658 yuan. Soon after, it fell another 3 yuan, but the mid-range 20-count yarn Double Globe and Heavenly Maiden markets were still flat. Buying momentum rose slightly in the middle, saying that someone came to buy, and the market rose back. The closing price was 665 yuan, and the stack price was 654 yuan. It was found that half-day transactions totaled 1,155 bales, with the 20-count Feng Ma falling by 7 yuan, Heavenly Maiden rising by 1 yuan, and Double Globe remaining unchanged. However, 10-count coarse yarn fell by 10 yuan. Today, 20 pieces of yarn were shipped to Siam, 55 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 100 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount bought by each bank is listed on the left: Peers 12 Hong Kong 10 Mainland 60 Ningbo 20 Fuzhou 20 Jiangxi 30. Total 1,255.</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Decline</h3>
<p>Cotton trading has progressed slightly, but Chinese factories are still reluctant to buy, while Japanese factories have some needs and are just decorating the market. Therefore, the market is extremely weak. In fact, the yarn market is not working, so the raw cotton, which is dependent on it, is drawn into the vortex. As a result, the selling price is 1-2 yuan lower than the previous day. The source of Northern Jiangsu is still strong, with 2,560 bales of Tonghua arriving, and 370 bales of Beisha coming. Today, 110 bales were shipped to Xiamen and 590 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The situation of various cotton types is listed on the left: Tongzhou 134.00 Trade 300 bales Another 142.00 Shanghai 500 bales Jiading 140.00 Another 200 bales Tongzhou 132.00 Trade 200 bales Fire Machine 124.00 Another 200 bales</p>
<p>Another report: The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has been particularly sluggish recently. Because the yarn price has not been able to recover, all parties are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Even Qingdao merchants are quiet about purchasing raw cotton. What factories hope for is that yarn sales can improve. Traders still have dozens of pieces of raw cotton in their hands, but they were all purchased and stored at high prices, so they are unwilling to sell at the current price. Combining the observations of all parties, this month is hopeless, and we must wait for a turnaround in yarn sales next month.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market initially surged due to purchases by overseas merchants, and domestic factories also had strong purchasing power due to the brisk sales of cloth. Later, the market situation suddenly turned weak due to a report of a decline from Bombay. Southern merchants also rushed to sell, and there were also sales among traders. Therefore, the closing was quite weak. As a result, the cotton price fell by 8 to 10 points from yesterday's market. India, including forecasts, fell by another 3 rupees. Egypt had little change, and Liverpool rose slightly by 2 pence.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Due to Scarcity and Manipulation, Rice Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>The rice market seems to be in a hovering trend. After falling back due to abundant arrivals a few days ago, the market rebounded yesterday due to cold weather and scarcity. The opening bids were high, and local stores were eager to buy, and merchants from the inland also absorbed the supply. In general, out-of-town merchants were extremely supportive, and prices rose repeatedly. If the kiln-dried and Bai Ge varieties only arrived with one carload in the whole city, with only 120 to 130 bags, which was a rare commodity and even more outstanding, the market was sold out quickly as buyers competed with each other. The price increased repeatedly, and the market was immediately sold out. The closing price was 31.30 yuan to 31 yuan, which was a huge increase of 1-2 yuan compared to the previous market. The Juexin glutinous rice market had more goods, but after falling to the bottom, the price seemed cheap. And once the weather turned cold, the body could immediately become firmer and more sustainable. Therefore, out-of-town merchants were unwilling to sell, and as a result, the price also increased by 0.5 yuan to nearly 1 yuan. The prices of broken and old new rice also increased by about 0.5 yuan, but the route was still not wide. However, in the current wind of rising prices, the price also increased by about 0.5 yuan. Lu Yang Jian was the same. As for Kejian, although it was heard that a certain foreign firm continued to launch the product, the market had tightened once before noon, and people were generally optimistic. Therefore, the morning wholesale and retail markets were very active, and each price continued to rise by 0.5 yuan. By noon, the owners believed that the price could not rise any further, and they rushed to sell, resulting in the market being filled with goods. The market was dull, and people began to be pessimistic. The total number of transactions in the day was 7,000 to 8,000 bags.</p>
<p>Another report: The supply of Ke Xian from Jiangbei and other sources was scarce yesterday, and not a single bag of Wan Xian, which was handled by Japanese merchants, was sold. Local villages were already interested in buying due to the continuous price declines, and the market was tense. However, after the active morning market, the afternoon and evening markets were more cautious, and the market remained flat. However, the transactions in the morning were not withdrawn in the afternoon, and the market price still increased by about 0.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Speculators Sell Off</h3>
<p>The Price of Goods in Transfer Stations is the Same as That of Factory Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour trade was flat. Because it was the weekend, manufacturers were unwilling to sell much for days, and the supply of round cage goods on the market also felt scarce, so customers felt lazy and loose. The market was stagnant, and the general small-scale speculators intended to sell. It was heard that the price of goods in transfer stations was the same as that of factory prices, which was a little looser than before. However, the price of foreign flour still had to be 8.12 yuan due to the lack of stock. The total number of transactions in the market was less than 30,000 bags, and the market changes had to wait until the beginning of next week. Today, 5,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's supply was still not much. The sellers were unwilling to loosen the price, but the factories felt that the price was too high, and they were cautious. As a result, the transaction was sparse. The total number of sales in the market was only 400 bags of Wuxi wheat, 10.03 yuan, and 3 carloads of Suzhou wheat, 10.06 yuan, all of which were handled by flour mills.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Raw Silk Prices Rise Sharply, Local Trading Becomes Thin</p>
<p>The silk market abroad, Yokohama, is still rising sharply. The morning price for spot goods was 1,860 yuan, up 60 yuan. The afternoon closing price was 1,900 yuan, up another 40 yuan. The price for forward goods was 1,810 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 1,858 yuan. Although the New York silk price fell, the spot price did not move. The short-term price fell by 6 cents, and the long-term price fell by a small 7 cents. The Shanghai silk market was also relatively weak. The price for White Factory 78 was 4,700 yuan, and the price for Chi Li was 2,300 yuan. Although there were transactions, foreign firms were no longer interested, and buyers' emotions seemed to have turned harsh. Therefore, the underground silk market trended down in the afternoon. It seems that high prices are no longer available, and general hoarders do not want to miss this opportunity to sell their goods. It is estimated that 110 loads were traded yesterday.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods Plunge, Stockpiles Flow Out, Traders Collect Slightly</p>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the trading of cotton cloth on this street and by Wenzhou merchants gradually became active. This was because the Shanghai-Wenzhou stations had the hope of resuming shipping soon, and customers started to buy. In addition, the market had been weak for a long time, and stockpiles were being sold at surprisingly low prices. Some traders took advantage of the low prices, but because the price of cloth was falling too sharply for Eastern piece goods, buyers and sellers were at a standstill. The selling price of small amounts of domestic goods was still falling, and the market was extremely chaotic. White goods fell by 5 cents to 5 jiao, and colored cloths and colored twills fell by 3 to 5 jiao. Nobody asked about miscellaneous brand blue cloths even if they were priced more than 1 yuan lower than the market. Light-colored bleached fine yarn goods for spring sales were relatively stable. Traders on this street bought more than 500 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, velvet cloth, bleached printed goods, etc. Wenzhou and Ningbo merchants bought more than 200 pieces of Ewo coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. Guangdong merchants bought more than 100 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, velvet cloth, etc. Merchants from Southeast Asia and Hong Kong also bought nearly 200 pieces.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods: The market atmosphere was bleak, and new low prices were being set repeatedly. In the morning market, Dragon Head fine cloth fell to (per piece) 18.60 yuan, and Four Gentlemen serge fell sharply to 0.625 yuan. Because the decline was too sharp in the later market, Japanese merchants bought 100-odd bales of Dragon Head, and traders on this street with bullish sentiment also took advantage of the low prices. More than 300 bales of fine cloth were traded, and 400-500 boxes of serge were traded. The selling market then rose slightly. The spot price of Dragon Head rose to 18.75 yuan, and the asking price for serge was 0.605 yuan to 0.6075 yuan per yard. The supply of Four Gentlemen straight tribute goods was relatively low, and most sellers were unwilling to sell at a low price. The market price was 0.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 215 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, 125 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, 100 pieces were shipped to Tule, and 155 pieces were shipped to Siam.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Imported Sugar Down Another 1-2 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no change in the foreign sugar market, according to foreign reports. The trend of the market prices set by the local guild was still weak. Stockpilers were also selling off, and the decline was alarming. The price of coarse white sugar 24 was 55 yuan, down 2.5 yuan. The price of outside station 56 yuan to 56 yuan 8 jiao, down 2 yuan to 1.2 yuan. The price of transit cargo was 45 yuan, down 1 yuan. The price of Taikoo Cart White was down 2 yuan to 1.5 yuan, with the B mark at 59.5 yuan to 60 yuan, the GW mark at 59.5 yuan, the GX mark at 59 yuan, the DJ mark at 57.5 yuan, and the HX mark at 57 yuan. The price of H mark Cart Red was 42.5 yuan, and the Dutch Red was 43.5 yuan, both down 1 yuan. The price of local cotton white Zhenji No. 1 was 55-57 yuan, No. 2 was 56.5 yuan, No. 3 was 56 yuan, and No. 4 was 55.5 yuan. The price of local No. 1 ice sugar was 68.5 yuan, and the price of Jingming ice sugar was 70 yuan, both down 1.5 yuan. The local sugar market was still weak and there was no continued opening.</p>
<h3>Coal</h3>
<p>Coal Balls Drop Steadily, Small Factory Goods Fall Another Two Yuan</p>
<p>Since the raw material Hongji arrived in large quantities, the price of coal balls has rebounded from 84 yuan at the peak to 70.2 yuan and 68 yuan, steadily declining. Because users had hoarded enough coal to prevent shortages in the previous month, the shop's business had no desire to buy. Small factory goods were even more sluggish. Therefore, the underground price fell by another two yuan the other day, but large factories such as Nanyang and Yitaixing still kept the original price. Traders sent it to customers at 70.05 yuan per ton, and customers retailed it at 3.8 yuan per load.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Produce</h3>
<p>Round Meat and Cassia Twig, New Market Prices Have Been Opened</p>
<p>The first batch of Tong'an new cassia twigs, yesterday, the large granules had a market price that was more than 20 yuan higher than the old goods, but it had not yet become a market. The new sun-dried round meat was opened at 1523 yuan, and the new Lianzhou round meat was 175 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>American Bar Iron Gradually Enters a Weak Path, White Lead Skin Customer Sales Move Slightly</p>
<p>American Bar Iron: The market situation has recently re-entered a weak path. The only customers who rely on it are local canneries and toy factories. However, recently those factories have no intention of buying. As a result, the sales market has been greatly affected. Currently, the market is only for small factories and retail customers. Therefore, the opening price is slightly reduced. The current market price is 110 yuan per box (based on the system's color), but the asking price for large single-hanging sizes is still 1178 yuan to more than 120 yuan per box.</p>
<p>White Lead Skin: Yesterday, the transaction suddenly flourished, and there were many inquiries in the market. Fuzhou merchants bought 30 barrels, and Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao and other merchants searched for nearly 100 barrels. As a result, the market was lively. The standard, such as thin color, sells for 800 yuan per barrel, medium-grade goods sell for 760-770 yuan per barrel, and thick color must be over 800 yuan per barrel.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Oil Beans Shipped to South China</p>
<p>Today (22nd), a large number of Miscellaneous Grains and Shandong Beans will be shipped to Hong Kong. The calculations are: 430 bags of Sorghum, 1230 bags of raw peanuts, 500 bags of peanuts, 2370 bags of Soybeans, 1245 tins of raw oil, 350 bags of Sesame seeds, and 500 tins of Sesame oil. Separately there will be 380 bags of Soybeans, 590 tins of Soybean oil to be shipped to Xiamen. Only 1000 pieces of bean cakes are shipped to Siam.</p>

<h3>America States a Strong Policy, Shanghai Situation Immediately Changes, Hull's Speech Broadcasts an Excitement to the People, Concession Authorities Attitude Changes to an Active Stance, It's Rumored that Direct Negotiations Will Commence Next Week</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Concession's position has been under threat from the Japanese. Ever since the start of the European War, the Japanese have supported the false police overstepping their bounds in the Huaxi regions, publicly establishing false police stations, sending false police armed marches, encroaching on police patrol positions, directing rioters, resolving robberies and seizing the Police's firearms, an escalation of events. The evening before last, at six fifty, it was planned to assault police patrols, causing both Chinese and Indian police officers a death and an injury. Especially to the foreign nations' interests connected to the Concession, these incidents have invoked extreme unease, causing them to take resolute actions in order to protect the life and property of both Chinese and foreigners. News spread yesterday that British soldiers have been sent to defend the overstepped border road regions, the diplomatic group has abandoned appeasement policies towards the Japanese false authorities, and is separately considering strong hand procedures. The American government has stated that it will assist the Bureau of Public Works in taking appropriate actions. Because of this, the hearts of the Shanghai people are greatly relieved, it is anticipated that the lawless behavior perpetrated by the Japanese false authorities may give rise to a serious end result. The following will separately record the details gathered yesterday.</p>
<h3>Hull States that Cooperation is United</h3>
<p>American Associated Press dispatched by Chang Wei'erxun Washington 21st Electric, State Secretary Hull, announced last night that the American Government intends to unite in cooperation with the Shanghai Bureau of Public Works, to resolve all kinds of incident. Just like the armed assault on the Bureau of Public Works police patrols in the overstepped border road regions last night. Hull proclaimed that the Bureau of Public Works is to determine the course of action, in order to resolve the incident, American officials stationed in Shanghai are extremely attentive to the incident, and are "uniting in cooperation to resolve the matter." Observers viewed that Hull spoke of "uniting in cooperation," which signified that the United States is prepared to respond to requests from the Bureau of Public Works to use arms to protect life and property of the American people in the overstepped border road regions, recently "Da Dao" police under Japanese management had intruded. Hull's communique is a restatement of the American Government's support of the Shanghai Bureau of Public Works efforts to protect the rights and interests of the overstepped border road regions and resist Japanese pressures to change the status of the Shanghai Public Concession.</p>
<h3>America Takes a Strong Policy</h3>
<p>However people that have access to news claim that to this day the State Department has not received any request for intervention by the government by American people whose lives and property have been endangered by "Da Dao" police intrusion into the overstepped border road regions. People that have access to news, view Bureau of Public Work's Director-General Fan Keling issuing a warning of the intention to petition the American Marine Corps to protect the life and property of the American people in the overstepped border road regions where the "Da Dao" police has intruded, this warning being a new indication that America is taking a more firm stance in the Far East. Washington observers are making a comparison of the communication made by Fan Keling and the open speech made in Tokyo by the American Ambassador to Japan, Gelu, this week.</p>
<h3>Fan Keling's Firm Attitude</h3>
<p>Mr. Franklin, an American citizen, told the Japanese that the American people understand the "New Order in East Asia" as the Japanese people do, but the American people oppose it because this measure seems to deprive the American people of their rights and interests in the Far East. Mr. Franklin's statement was issued after one Chinese constable of the Shanghai Municipal Council was shot and killed by thugs in the extraterritorial road area, and one Indian constable was seriously injured. Mr. Franklin stated that if American people residing in the extraterritorial road area need protection, he will request the US government to provide such protection. Mr. Franklin declared, "As far as I am concerned, we cannot abandon the foreign residents residing in the extraterritorial road area who should be protected by the Municipal Council."</p>
<p>Wholehearted Assistance to the Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<p>Observers here point out that Mr. Franklin's statement is one of the most resolute attitudes publicly expressed by a Municipal Council official since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Some people believe that Mr. Franklin's firm statement will definitely lead the US government to assist the Shanghai Municipal Council in the issue of tax revenue and police power in the extraterritorial road area. US diplomatic actions in the Far East have shown a tough stance since the outbreak of the war in Europe. Some people believe that the reason why the United States has adopted a tough attitude is partly to protect its own rights in China, and partly because Britain and France are fighting in Europe and have no time to take care of the Far East. Since the outbreak of the European war, the United States has strengthened the defense of its Asian fleet in the Philippines. People who know the situation well believe that the US Far East policy has not changed, but it has now adopted more resolute actions.</p>
<h3>Direct Negotiations to be Held Next Week</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that after reporters interviewed key officials of the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government today (the 21st), it is expected that the two sides will hold direct negotiations next week to resolve various disputes between the two authorities, including the long-pending issue of extraterritorial roads. Although the two sides are still in a deadlock after holding preliminary informal discussions on March 23 this year, reporters still believe that the two sides will hold direct negotiations. The discussion on March 23 was held by Mayor Chuan Xiaoan and Mr. Fessenden, the former Director-General of the Municipal Council, at the Broadway Building. It was not until the beginning of last month that Mr. Phillips, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, met with Chuan Xiaoan in</p>
<p>The City Center</p>
<p>and fell into a new deadlock. However, according to an announcement last week that the Municipal Council has applied to the Consular Body for mediation in this matter, as a result, the Japanese Consulate authorities in this city were consulted and requested to provide assistance. It is heard that after many efforts by the Japanese authorities, there is now hope for an early solution to the problems between the two sides. At the same time, it is heard from reliable sources that the Special Municipal Government may submit</p>
<p>Suggestions Prepared</p>
<p>to the Consular Body within a few days, which will require the complete management of the western district by the Chinese authorities as the basis for recovering the extraterritorial roads, and the Municipal Government will reimburse all expenses incurred by the Public Concession in the construction, repair, and special construction of roads in the area. In addition, the expenses incurred by water, telephone, and electricity companies in the area</p>
<p>Expenses Incurred</p>
<p>will also be considered. Previously, Mayor Yu Hongjun had negotiated with Mr. Fessenden, the former Director-General of the Municipal Council, on the issue of extraterritorial road construction for several years, but there were no shooting incidents or terrorist acts against Public Concession police officers during this period. The two sides finally agreed on tentative terms, stipulating the organization of a special joint management agency for extraterritorial roads, with a Chinese person as the director, recommended by the Municipal Council and appointed by the Chinese government, and a foreigner as the deputy director. However, this solution to</p>
<p>Outstanding Issues</p>
<p>was sabotaged by the Japanese, because the new management agency would completely control North Sichuan Road starting from Bazilu, and the Japanese felt that their "sphere of influence" would be affected. It is believed that this plan would affect the strategic value of the expanding Japanese Marine Corps barracks at that time,</p>
<p>Had a Considerable Impact</p>
<p>Therefore, the Japanese strongly opposed it. Due to Japan's refusal to approve this plan, the talks between Yu Hongjun and Fessenden were temporarily suspended. After the outbreak of the war, the Chinese army withdrew, Yu resigned, and Fessenden also retired. This plan had to be abandoned.</p>
<h3>News Arrives, All of Shanghai Rejoices</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that Shanghai received news this morning (the 21st) and learned that the US government has guaranteed to assist the Municipal Council in resolving incidents such as the death and injury of one police officer in the area that the Dadao authorities are trying to seize, which occurred last night, and is rejoicing. Discussions focused on the remarks made by US Secretary of State Hull to cooperate with the Municipal Council. Reporters visited Mr. Franklin, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, this morning, who said that the words of the US Secretary of State are</p>
<p>Extremely Appreciated</p>
<p>He has not yet had time to discuss the new developments with the directors of the Municipal Council and the US authorities. In any case, this can indicate that the lives and property of American residents in the extraterritorial road area will be protected. Mr. Franklin said last night (the 20th) that if American people residing in the extraterritorial road area need protection, he will request the US government to provide</p>
<p>This Kind of Protection</p>
<p>The American community was very pleased to hear the news, and the rumor that the US Marine Corps will be deployed to protect the many lives and large amounts of property of American residents in the area is spreading. However, the general feeling is that since the area is a British defense zone, the initial protection should be the responsibility of the British army, because the British and American defense forces obviously cannot only protect the citizens of their own countries in the entire Public Concession. Therefore, the areas were originally assigned to</p>
<p>Troops Stationed by Various Countries</p>
<p>for defense, and each was responsible for taking care of the people of all countries in these areas. Many people feel that the British troops stationed in Shanghai have failed to adequately protect their defense zone, and the blame does not lie with the British troops themselves, but with the British government. This point seems to be what the American community in this city regrets. However, when needed, the Americans will not hesitate to lend a helping hand to the British. Regarding assisting the police department,</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary</p>
<p>Halifax's failure to make any statement on the situation in the Shanghai slum area was severely criticized in this city this morning. Speakers said that the British Foreign Secretary has forgotten the existence of Shanghai. As for the US Marine Corps entering our British defense zone, no news has been received as of this afternoon. However, at the same time, the two overworked British army battalions stationed in Shanghai have dispatched many patrols to assist in view of the sudden shooting of police officers.</p>
<h3>Mr. Franklin's Letter Requests the Attention of the Consular Body</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that after one Chinese constable of the police department was killed and one Indian constable was injured last night (the 20th), the military immediately deployed sentry posts beside the traffic signals at various intersections along Yuyuan Road this morning (the 21st). Mr. Franklin, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, decided to pay attention to the accident today. It is heard that Mr. Franklin's letter will point out that this incident is an example of the current</p>
<p>Serious Situation</p>
<p>in the extraterritorial road area and will formally summarize the incident. Soldiers of the British East Surrey Regiment were deployed this morning, and two sentries were stationed next to each traffic signal and intersection in the area. According to some sources, the "Special Municipal Government" is eager to take over complete management of the traffic signals in the extraterritorial road area, which is the motive for last night's shooting. It is also said that in August, "Special Municipal Government" police officers were shot by Public Concession constables near the scene of last night's shooting, killing and injuring three people,</p>
<p>Seeking Revenge</p>
<p>As a result, this shooting incident occurred. This morning, the East Surrey Regiment continued to send British soldiers to guard along the roads in the western district, and special patrols continued to patrol back and forth. Recently, the number of "Special Municipal Government" police officers on the extraterritorial roads has gradually increased, but these police officers were not seen in the western district all morning today. The police department is still conducting investigations this morning, so it has not issued a formal report on last night's incident. The number of thugs involved in the case could not be confirmed this morning. It is said that the</p>
<p>Gang of Thugs</p>
<p>numbered three to five people. The injured Indian constable is still in the hospital for treatment this morning, and it is believed that his injuries are not very serious. Also, the British army began building two sandbag fortifications at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road and Daxilu today, and will permanently station troops in them. British Army Commander Simmons presented flowers to the injured Indian constable today and attached a note congratulating his spirit of bravery.</p>
<h3>Strict Precautions on the Borders of the Concession</h3>
<p>The western border of the Public Concession looks like an area under attack, heavily armored and ready for anything, to prevent any eventuality. Soldiers and detectives from various countries, all fully armed, are densely deployed everywhere. Reporters from Da Zhong News Agency inspected the area last night and saw that the puppet police in the extraterritorial road area were very frightened, and their every move was mostly subservient to the Japanese military police. The British East Surrey Regiment was walking on the sidewalks, busily</p>
<p>Building Sandcastles</p>
<p>A British army unit, fully armored, patrolled in the middle of the road. A red armored car equipped with a Thompson submachine gun, managed by the police detectives, was stationed at the thoroughfare. The detectives carried rifles and revolvers, and were ready to act. The tension in the air was unprecedented. There were no fewer than 500 puppet police officers on both sides of Yuyuan Road, one post every ten yards, from Difeng Road to Jingwei's residence. This kind of demonstration deployment has other reasons. It is said that the Japanese army</p>
<p>Major General Itagaki</p>
<p>visited Wang yesterday. The puppet police, under the command of the Japanese military police, appeared on Yuyuan Road at 1:30 p.m. yesterday. An hour later, 20 cars quickly passed through, one of which was guarded by four motorcycles, and the horns honked in unison. Itagaki entered Wang's residence at this time. Two hours later, the car formation returned along the same route, and the puppet police also removed the special deployment, leaving the usual number at the traffic posts at each intersection, facing the concession police in</p>
<p>Dual Post Confrontation</p>
<p>When the reporter from Da Zhong News Agency inspected yesterday, he discovered a very interesting contrast. The attendants and guards of Major General Itagaki were so strict when he went out, while Major General Simmons, the commander of the British defense forces, inspected the extraterritorial road area alone yesterday, supervising the construction of sandcastle projects by British soldiers, with only one unarmed chauffeur accompanying him. Major Arthur Ashmore of the British Army went to the extraterritorial road area for inspection yesterday morning and ordered the British army to be at the southwest corner of Yidingpan Road and Daxilu, and the northeast corner of Yidingpan Road,</p>
<p>Build a Sandcastle</p>
<p>A sandcastle was built, and soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment were ordered to start work immediately and did not finish until dusk. The company soldiers are now stationed there, and there are more than 200 concession police officers performing duties in the extraterritorial road area. The deployment at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Daxilu and Yuyuan Road is even tighter, because the puppet municipal government has repeatedly threatened the traffic posts at these two locations, and the attack on the concession police occurred on the evening of the 20th.</p>
<h3>Phillips' Solemn Attitude</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that reporters visited Mr. Phillips, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, last night (the 20th), and he made the following remarks: The cowardly attack on the police department constables last night will shock Shanghai and the governments of all countries with expatriates in China. The extraterritorial roads in the western district were built and maintained by the Municipal Council, and the police department has been in charge of police affairs for many years. The Municipal Council has spent huge sums of money to develop this western district, and as a result, the western district has become an orderly and well-managed area. The Municipal Council has never recognized the Chinese sovereignty over the land on which the extraterritorial roads are built, and is always prepared to engage in reasonable discussions on any constructive suggestions regarding police affairs and tax revenue in the western district. In the past, the Chinese administrative authorities did not attempt to forcibly drive the Municipal Council's power out of this area by force, but today the Municipal Council is threatened by force, causing serious threats to law and order. Shanghai is an international neutral city with a unique status, and this status can only be maintained with the support of various countries. The Municipal Council is not a sovereign state, but a municipal organization representing the interests of all countries with expatriates in Shanghai. The Municipal Council is today threatened by those who seem to disregard the rights and interests established by the years of efforts of various countries in the western district. The Municipal Council trusts in world public opinion and the assistance of various countries.</p>
<h3>Mr. Franklin's Statement: No Concessions</h3>
<p>Mr. Franklin, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, issued a statement the night before last, stating in affirmative terms, "The Municipal Council will not make any concessions on its rights and interests in the extraterritorial roads. We cannot disregard the expatriates in the area who enjoy the protection of the Municipal Council." Mr. Franklin also stated that if American residents residing in the extraterritorial road area need appropriate protection, the US government should send troops to protect them. When asked by reporters whether this would allow the US Marine Corps to patrol in the extraterritorial road area, Mr. Franklin replied that if there is such a need and the US Navy is requested to patrol in the area, it can be done, but only to protect the rights and interests of Americans. As for other foreigners, they can only rely on their own governments. Reporters also asked what methods the Municipal Council would use to prevent its rights and interests in the extraterritorial roads from being expelled. Mr. Franklin stated that he cannot announce it now, because the Municipal Council has not yet found a clear and visible method to protect its rights and interests.</p>
<h3>After the Defeat in the War of Aggression Against China, Japan Will Stake Everything, The Entire Japanese Navy's Third Fleet is Mobilized, Nishio Shigeru is the Commander-in-Chief of All Japanese Forces in China</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that according to reliable sources, Japan may send its entire navy to participate in the Sino-Japanese War in accordance with its recent plan to end the war as soon as possible. Nishio's recent promotion to Commander-in-Chief of all Japanese forces in China, and the appointment of former Japanese Army Minister Itagaki as Deputy Commander-in-Chief, is part of a larger plan to strengthen military power and establish closer contact among the Japanese forces currently fighting in China. After the Japanese army was transferred, it was expected that the Japanese navy would continue to send warships to participate in the war. According to news about the possible transfer of the Japanese navy in China, the Japanese Third Fleet, which is currently engaged in all Japanese naval activities in China, will be transferred to North China, the First Fleet currently berthed in Japan will sail to Central China, and the Second Fleet will carry out activities in South China.</p>
<h3>Japan Occupies the Bank of Communications Building, Will Submit a Negotiation, The Bank of Communications Asks the Municipal Council to Consult with the Japanese Side for Return</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that according to news from financial circles here yesterday (the 20th), the staff of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of Communications have received instructions from the Chongqing Head Office to submit a request to the Municipal Council to consult with the Japanese side for the return of the occupied bank property. According to reports, the bank property was forcibly occupied by the Japanese military police a week ago after they failed to rent a portion of it. The occupied area includes four or five two-story buildings, which have been converted into Japanese military police dormitories. Although the bureau has consulted with the Japanese side, it has not yet been able to recover the two-story buildings. At the same time, the bank continues to operate in the last two floors of the building, using the main entrance facing the Bund for access.</p>
<h3>Tram Tickets Gradually Recovered, After the Issuance of the Second Batch of Subsidiary Coins, the Two Concessions Should Restrict Exit</h3>
<p>After the Bank of China issued the first batch of 500,000 yuan of subsidiary coins, because citizens hoarded them and some flowed into the occupied areas, the market was still insufficient. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Central Bank yesterday, requesting that the second batch of 500,000 yuan be issued as soon as possible, so that the problem of the shortage of small coins in Shanghai could be completely resolved. The Federation also sent separate letters to the tram companies in the two concessions, requesting that the temporary substitute coin tickets issued be recalled within a limited time, so that the transitional state of the lack of small coins can be a thing of the past as soon as possible. It is understood that the tram three-cent tickets are being recalled and invalidated by the company, but they can still be used on the market and are scheduled to be extended to the 20th of next month. The total amount of tram tickets issued is extremely large, reportedly nearly 700,000 yuan. Therefore, after the issuance of the second batch of subsidiary coins, if they are allowed to flow out of the special district, it is still feared that they will not be enough for the market.</p>
<h3>Delay in Loading and Unloading of Goods from Ningbo Due to Wind, Many Ship Schedules Have Been Changed, and Incoming Goods Are Extremely Rare</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance ordered that export goods on the Shanghai-Ningbo line must be settled in foreign exchange, the number of goods coming from Ningbo has decreased sharply. Therefore, each ship only has outgoing goods and no incoming goods, and the ship schedule should be shortened as usual. However, due to the recent hurricane in the Nanyang area, the loading and unloading of goods has been delayed. The Haida, Moufu, Yongtai and other ships that were supposed to arrive on the 16th and 17th have not yet arrived in Shanghai. It is now heard that the Haida ship can arrive in Shanghai this morning and will depart for Ningbo tomorrow. In addition to carrying passengers, no cargo will be loaded, because the ship must go to Nanyang after going to Ningbo. The company has now changed the tonnage reserved for the Haida ship by various customs brokers to be loaded and transported to Ningbo by the Dabu ship, which will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 24th. Jardine Matheson's Moufu ship will return to Shanghai on the 24th and will depart for Ningbo on the 26th and 27th. Jardine Matheson's Yongtai Maller will also return to Shanghai within days and continue to sail to Ningbo.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Confirms Mutiny of Japanese Troops in Hankou, Thirteen Killed by Shooting Before it Was Suppressed, Wounded Japanese Soldiers All Boarded Ships at Night</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that the news of the mutiny of Japanese troops in Hankou two months ago was confirmed yesterday (the 20th) by a well-known foreigner and an official of a local consulate who had just arrived in Shanghai from Hankou. According to the actual situation, the two Japanese divisions stationed in Hankou for a long time were increasingly dissatisfied with the ineffective and prolonged war, resulting in several small teams openly rebelling and refusing to obey orders. The Japanese authorities executed thirteen Japanese soldiers by shooting before it was suppressed. One of the divisions was immediately transferred from Hankou, and it is believed that another division was sent to participate in the recent Battle of Changsha. Even foreigners residing in Hankou are very difficult to obtain news, because their movements are restricted and the Japanese side's inspection is relentless. For example, Japanese wounded soldiers have never been seen transported in the streets of Hankou, but medical ships sailing to Hankou are obviously endless, because wounded and sick Japanese soldiers are transported and boarded the ships at night, and the medical ships must also sail out at night. The morale of the Chinese people in Hankou is almost openly patriotic. The most important topic of their daily conversations is that the Chinese army will soon re-enter Hankou.</p>
<h3>After the Disappearance of Yuan Ying, All Sectors Care, Safety Can Be Assured, Rescue is Quite Difficult</h3>
<p>Since Master Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was kidnapped from the Yuanming Lecture Hall at 443 Daxilu, the Datong News Agency contacted the Buddhist Association on Hedelu and the Yuanming Lecture Hall again yesterday morning, but has not yet learned of his whereabouts. Although there are records in foreign newspapers that he was detained at the Japanese military police headquarters at 94 Jules Garnier Road in western Shanghai, the Buddhist community does not believe it, because his daily behavior is not enough to provoke jealousy from the Japanese side. It is understood that when Yuan Ying was in Singapore, in addition to raising funds for the Chinese Buddhist Association, he also raised donations for Chinese refugees. All these measures are the true colors of monks, inseparable from compassion as the foundation. The Buddhist Association and his friends believe that his safety can be assured, but it is difficult to say whether he can be released quickly.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of Sniping Shanghai's Western Police is to Seize Traffic Posts, The Municipal Council Does Not Intend to Protest Yet, It is Definitely Proven That the Murderer is a Puppet Police</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that at 6:44 p.m. yesterday (the 20th), a Chinese constable of the police department at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road was shot and killed on the spot by two plainclothes thugs, and an Indian constable was seriously injured. The three thugs were walking along Yidingpan Road from the south, approaching Indian constable No. 459. Two of them suddenly grabbed the Indian constable's hands and twisted them behind his back, ordering him not to move. The third person stood three feet away, holding a Mauser pistol and pointing it directly at the Indian constable. The Indian constable tried to break free, and one of the thugs ordered the third person to shoot. A bullet was fired, entering the Indian constable's right chest. The three thugs then tried to escape, and in order to escape safely, they shot and killed Chinese constable No. 3378, who was standing on the upper right side. The armed police of the "Special Municipal Government" stationed there immediately fled as fast as they could when they heard the gunshots, and did not provide any assistance to the outnumbered police department constables. This is the most audacious attempt to coerce police department personnel that has rarely occurred in the western district, and is entirely provocative in nature. As a result of the shooting incident, a large number of constables and British soldiers from the East Surrey Regiment patrolled the vicinity of the area to prevent unfortunate events from recurring.</p>
<p>Regarding the attack on the Chinese and Indian constables on the extraterritorial road post on the evening of the 10th, Mr. Phillips, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, said yesterday (the 21st) that the bureau does not intend to protest yet and is not considering it? It is too early to believe that the criminals in this case must be related to the puppet police. Now, based on the evidence obtained from the investigation, it can be definitely concluded. "According to the reporter from Da Zhong News Agency, the police department of the concession learned of the assault from a few eyewitnesses from the police department, the investigation department was able to gather some leads from the victims of the incident.</p>
<p>Thugs Commit Murder, Puppet Police Escape</p>
<p>Before the incident, the Indian constable was managing the traffic lights, while the victimized Chinese constable was one of the three Chinese constables stationed on the northwest side of the intersection. The Indian constable was shot in the chest, but fortunately it did not enter the lungs, but came out from the other side. Although he was injured, he resolutely continued to manage the traffic. At that time, an Englishman named Crane, an employee of the Shanghai Power Company, was near the scene of the incident and ran to the Indian constable. The Indian constable only said, "I was shot twice." The Big Indian constable already knew that he had two injuries, but did not understand that it was a bullet that had passed through. After the three thugs committed the murder, they fled north along Yidingpan Road. The "Special Municipal Government" police stationed diagonally across the street, far from adding rescue, but fled away, and did not reappear at the scene until twenty minutes later. The police reserve team, upon hearing the news, departed from the Jing'an Temple police station, carrying Thompson submachine guns, and drove quickly to the scene a few minutes later. Chief Patrol Bowen, Deputy Chief Patrol Smith, Assistant Chief Patrol Sampson, and Dirk all stood by to personally supervise the investigation.</p>
<p>Police Authorities Keep Silent</p>
<p>Late last night, police department personnel refused to make any statements regarding the shooting incident and the uncaptured criminals. However, there seems to be little doubt as to who the criminals are. It must be remembered that on October 13, a large number of "Special Municipal Government" police forcibly took over the traffic light posts at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yuyuan Road and Daxilu. After a long negotiation, they were finally driven away. It is also heard that the "Special Municipal Government" police bureau indirectly announced that they would take over the two traffic posts on Monday, but it failed because the police department took precautions. The police department heard on Wednesday that the "Special Municipal Government" would make an effort to take over the two intersections on Thursday morning, so it took strong precautions again, and no accidents occurred. Therefore, last night's shooting incident can only be regarded as a direct attempt to coerce the constables stationed at the location in order to take it over. There is no question of police department constables firing their guns now, because when the Chinese and Indian constables were carried into the ambulance, their pistols were still in their bags.</p>
<p>Armored Cars Guard and Precaution</p>
<p>The thugs used Mauser pistols. According to eyewitnesses, the "Special Municipal Government" police had left the scene a few minutes before the incident. However, this statement could not be officially confirmed. After the cowardly shooting incident, special precautions were immediately taken in the area. In addition to calling out all the reserve team constables, two armored cars were stationed at the intersection. In addition to the numerous constables stationed, the British army authorities also dispatched a large number of patrols to patrol the extraterritorial roads. It was heard last night that armored cars would be stationed at the intersection of Yuyuan Road and Yidingpan Road, and the intersection of Daxilu and Yidingpan Road today, to prevent the "Special Municipal Government" police from making any further attempts to forcibly interfere with the two traffic posts.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Imports of Foreign Goods; Shanghai Customs Turns into a Trade Surplus; Brisk Exports and Increased Sales to the U.S. Indicate Overall Improvement in Trade</h3>
<p>Following the Ministry of Finance's all-out efforts to adjust foreign trade, customs offices in the Southwest have now shifted to trade surpluses. However, the Shanghai Customs, located in the occupied area, still shows a trade deficit, ranking first among all customs offices. Since the outbreak of the European War, trade with China by Britain, France, and Germany has been significantly impacted due to shipping issues. Consequently, imports through the Shanghai Customs have sharply declined, while exports, driven by robust sales to the U.S., have seen an increase. In September, the Shanghai Customs turned into a trade surplus, amounting to 17,894,164 national currency units. This situation represents a significant improvement in China's trade. The import and export trade figures for the Shanghai Customs in September are detailed below:</p>
<p>Imported Foreign Goods</p>
<p>Cotton, yarn, and thread, with a net value of 18,127,931 national currency units; Candles, soap, oils, wax, and rosin, totaling 4,230,875 units; Metals and mineral ores, amounting to 3,525,956 units; Coal, fuel, asphalt, and coal tar, totaling 3,287,956 units; Wool and its products, amounting to 2,820,183 units; Chemical products and pharmaceuticals, totaling 2,139,346 units; Books, maps, paper, and wooden paper products, amounting to 1,873,436 units; Dyes, pigments, paints, and varnish, totaling 1,897,783 units; Grand total valued at 48,816,916 national currency units.</p>
<p>Exported Native Goods</p>
<p>Animals and animal products, valued at 10,180,100 national currency units; Textile fibers, totaling 19,247,145 units; Yarn, woven goods, and knitted products, amounting to 9,857,659 units; Piece goods, totaling 8,236,600 units; Sundries, amounting to 3,278,811 units; Other textiles, totaling 2,417,827 units; Mineral ores, metals, and metal products, amounting to 2,149,648 units; Grains and their products, totaling 2,143,147 units; Tea, totaling 1,909,706 units; Grand total valued at 66,711,080 national currency units.</p>
<p>Turning into a Trade Surplus</p>
<p>The total value of imports and exports in September was 115,527,996 national currency units, resulting in a surplus of 17,894,164 units. Compared to August, imports decreased by 16,637,332 units, and exports increased by 5,500,211 units. Imports decreased by approximately 24.56%, while exports increased by approximately 9.94%. The trade surplus for October is expected to be even higher than in September. This situation is beneficial to China's war of resistance, reversing the adverse trend in China's trade and balancing international income.</p>
<h3>The Design of Daily Necessities Should Include Anti-Japanese War Significance</h3>
<p>The Political Department of the National Military Council recently sent a letter to the Ministry of Interior, instructing administrative inspectors in various provinces to ensure that the decoration and labeling of daily necessities produced by factories across the country, such as landscape paintings on towels, washbasins, and teapots, as well as picture cards in cigarettes, should be replaced with cartoons and simple slogans that are rich in anti-Japanese war significance, in order to boost the courage to resist the enemy and expand the effect of propaganda.</p>
<h3>Clearance of Goods from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia Held in Haiphong; Consultation on Extending Registration Deadline</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Sichuan Merchants Public Welfare Association regarding the certification of goods from Germany held by Chinese merchants. The Chamber forwarded the letter to the French Consulate General in Shanghai, requesting assistance. A reply has now been received from the French Consulate General stating that the Chamber’s letter regarding the German goods handled by Sichuan merchants has been duly noted. The Consulate General requests that the Chamber promptly send a relevant person, carrying supporting documents for the purchase of the aforementioned goods, to the Consulate General to complete the procedures. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has forwarded this information to the Sichuan Merchants Public Welfare Association to inform the relevant merchants to proceed accordingly.</p>
<p>Two Commissioners in Contact Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Bomin and Chen Shanzhi, special commissioners of the Haiphong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, visited Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of General Chambers of Commerce, and Xu Jiqing, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, yesterday to discuss the issue of goods from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia detained in Haiphong. (1) Regarding the visa issue, the French Consul has agreed to handle it. (2) Regarding the extension of the registration deadline, a request has been made to the Haiphong authorities, and Consul General Xu in Hanoi and Consul Liu in Haiphong have been asked to assist in achieving the extension. However, it is difficult to predict whether the Haiphong authorities will approve it. It is hoped that all cargo owners will find a way to complete the procedures before the end of this month.</p>
<p>Visa Procedures to Be Handled as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Since the Haiphong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the French Consul General reached an agreement on the visa procedures for goods from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia detained in Haiphong and awaiting shipment to the southwestern provinces of China, cargo owners have been applying for visas from the French Consulate General. They are taking the visa documents to the Haiphong authorities to request clearance. However, the Haiphong authorities have set a deadline of the 31st of this month. The cargo owners with goods detained in Haiphong are mostly dealing in Western pigments, paper, medicine, hardware and machine parts. Yesterday, Zhang Peizhen, a special representative of the Paper Industry Association, visited Wu and Chen, the two special representatives of the Haiphong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, to discuss the clearance of goods.</p>
<h3>British Military Attaché Spear Arrives in Shanghai; Detained by Japanese Troops for Several Months; Will Stay Briefly in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the British Army military attaché to China, who was detained by Japanese troops in Zhangjiakou for several months, arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin today (the 21st) and may stay here for a few days.</p>
<h3>National Goods Joint Sales Office Opens Today; National Goods Manufacturers Participate Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>The National Goods Manufacturers Joint Sales Office, organized by the national goods industry in this city, is scheduled to open for business today. The entire second floor of the office has not yet been completely furnished. The official opening ceremony will be postponed until the middle of next month. The national goods manufacturers participating in the office include Zhonghua Hat Factory, Guoguang Thermos Bottle Factory, Dafeng Knitting Factory, Meihua Underwear Company,</p>
<h3>Yochow Steamer Flees to Shantou to Avoid Hurricane but is Refused by Japanese Under False Pretenses; Rejection of Third-Country Shipping Reaches New Peak; Failure to Provide Assistance in Times of Danger is Unbecoming of Civilized Nations</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," the Japanese obstruction of third-country shipping along the Chinese coast reached a new peak last week when, according to passengers on the Yochow steamer of the Taikoo Dockyard and Engineering Company of Hong Kong, the Japanese refused to allow the steamer to enter Shantou to take shelter from a hurricane. Passengers aboard were angered by the Japanese "action, unworthy of a civilized nation, in refusing to assist a ship in distress." When the Yochow approached Shantou, signals were sent from the shore to stop the ship and order it out of the harbor, claiming that there were no good places to shelter from the hurricane in the port of Shantou. The Yochow, having been driven away from Shantou, sailed thirty miles further to Nan’ao Island to anchor. Fortunately, when the Yochow first anchored, the direction of the hurricane blowing towards the ship changed, so the passengers escaped great danger. The Yochow remained there for sixty-six hours before continuing on its way, reaching Shanghai from Hong Kong in almost eight days. All kinds of food were sufficient on board, so the passengers had no complaints about this. According to shipping circles, there are now few safe havens from hurricanes along the Chinese coast, as the Chinese, in order to prevent the Japanese from invading, have removed the markers previously erected along the coast to assist navigation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Consuls Stationed Throughout China Gather in Shanghai; A Total of Eleven Cities, Including Hong Kong; Discuss Details of Consular Affairs and Techniques</h3>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News," officials from Japanese consulates stationed in eleven cities in China, including Hong Kong, began a two-day meeting at the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday (the 30th). According to a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate General, the scope of the meeting is the broadest since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, aiming to discuss technical details for conducting consular affairs and to exchange information on the current situation in their respective locations. Two officials dispatched from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo are also participating.</p>

<h3>The Truth Behind the Case of Intimidation of an Assistant Manager of a Money Exchange; Money Exchange Exploits with High Interest Rates; A Small Loan Results in a Major Lawsuit; Bullying a Woman Leads to Harm to the Innocent; The Borrower Raises Funds to Clear the Debt</h3>
<p>Zhang Lingyun, the assistant manager of Yongcheng Money Exchange, located in room 241 of the Zhonghui Building, which lends money at high interest rates, hired lawyer Sun Shi'an to represent him in a case against Bi Haomin in the criminal court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Bi of using a handgun to violently intimidate and threaten him. The arguments have concluded, and a ruling is pending. This newspaper has previously reported on this case. The content of this case is complex, and the details are worth disclosing, so we will describe it in more detail below. It was found that before the August 13th incident,</p>
<p>Wang Xiquan, a mail carrier from the post office, borrowed 60 national currency units from Yongcheng Money Exchange, with Mao Wenlong, the former postmaster of Qianlima Road Post Office, and a Mr. Zhang, currently an employee of the package department of the Postal Administration, as co-guarantors. Wang had repaid over two periods, with a net balance of 48 units (although the loan was 60 units, after deducting pre-paid interest and various fees, only about 80% was received). The war broke out suddenly, and financial transactions ceased, so Wang did not continue to pay on time. This year or last year, the money exchange</p>
<p>Filed a Lawsuit in Court</p>
<p>(Presumably a collective lawsuit) against the second defendant, the guarantor Mao Wenlong himself. In the previous year, Mao was transferred to the Hankou Post Office, and his family resided at No. 130 Maggie Lane. The court summoned them, but the woman, unfamiliar with legal procedures, did not appoint anyone to appear in court after receiving the summons. Later, after being instructed, she refused to accept the final summons from the execution court, leading to an argument with the process server. The process server told Mao's wife that unless she immediately divorced Mao Wenlong, she could not escape responsibility. As a result, Mao's family</p>
<p>Became Greatly Alarmed</p>
<p>And advertised to sublet the rented house and hurriedly moved to the countryside. A person named Li Linshu found Zhang Yimei at the contact location and was led to Maggie Lane to sublet the house. Unexpectedly, within three days of moving in, Li's wife went into confinement, and the company led many people to seal up the movable property in the house. Despite all explanations, no one paid attention. Li had no choice but to negotiate with Zhang Yimei and tell Bi Haomin, Zhang's employer. Bi, filled with righteous indignation, accompanied Li to the Yongcheng Money Exchange to explain the situation and</p>
<p>Requested Immediate Unsealing</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the money exchange wanted to kill the chicken to scare the monkeys (those borrowing money at high interest rates). Seeing that Bi was wearing a self-defense handgun, they exaggerated the situation and twisted Bi over to the police for prosecution. The case is now awaiting sentencing. It is perplexing that the money exchange only sealed up the movable property of the guarantor for 48 units, without ever pursuing the principal debtor Wang or the other guarantor Zhang. They solely targeted the second guarantor, who was not in Shanghai,</p>
<p>And Their Female Family Members</p>
<p>Exercised Their Legal Rights. Moreover, the current tenant was not the original tenant, and the debtor Wang and the other guarantor Zhang were clearly still working at the Shanghai Post Office. The reason for this is unclear. It is also heard that there are many companies in Shanghai lending money at high interest rates. Since the outbreak of the war, most debtors have temporarily left Shanghai. It is now known that there are countless cases where unilateral judgments have been publicly served, forcing repayment of debts. Once clarity is restored, there will be countless disputes. Wang, the original debtor in the intimidation case, knowing that the matter had</p>
<p>Affected Outsiders</p>
<p>Innocently, has raised funds to settle the matter with the company. However, it is heard that all expenses since the lawsuit must be paid off first before the loan account can be closed. The current total of fees being pursued for the lawsuit will amount to 40 units. Even the car fare for the seizure alone costs more than 6 units.</p>
<p>Philanthropic Lottery Hires Manager Xu Weizhou</p>
<p>The charity lottery for the relief of refugees, the only lottery allowed to be issued in the two concession areas, has been running for fourteen periods since its inception. The prizes are generous, and the credit is outstanding. The relief funds allocated to Chinese and Western charities have successively reached a large sum of more than 700,000 units. For the sake of convenience in promotion, Xu Weizhou has been hired as the Chinese General Manager. Mr. Xu is a well-known scholar in our country who studies sales techniques. He presides over Fengxing Company and promotes various methods, which are deeply appreciated by the members of the lottery committee. In addition to the monthly charity lottery, it is heard that a large charity lottery method has been drafted, with drawings held once or twice a year. Each ticket costs ten units, and the first prize is one million units. The first drawing is scheduled to be held before the end of the lunar year.</p>
<h3>Seven Robbers Hold Up Car; Over 40,000 Yuan Stolen</h3>
<p>At 10:45 AM yesterday, a car with license plate number 18230 was traveling on Xiaoshadu Road near Nanyang in the Public Concession when suddenly seven robbers, armed with handguns and seemingly aware that the people in the car were carrying a large sum of money, appeared from their hiding places. As the car approached, they shouted for it to stop, opened the car door, pulled one of the passengers out of the car, and robbed him of 41,000 yuan in cash before fleeing. The police were informed and rushed to apprehend them, but the robbers had disappeared. A thorough investigation is currently underway.</p>
<p>Another report stated that the car that was held up, with Public Concession license number 18230, was a rented car hired by Hengmao Money Exchange at No. 379 Sichuan Road. Because a depositor was withdrawing money, a special car was hired to deliver it. It is unknown how the robbers learned of this and ambushed the car on the way. The police are currently conducting a thorough investigation and tracing the robbers. The actual amount stolen was 41,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Four Russian Jewish Men Expelled from Hong Kong for Holding Forged Passports Arrive in Shanghai; The Main Culprit of Forging Passports Arrested in Shanghai; Awaiting the Arrival of the Four Russian Men to Investigate the Case</h3>
<p>Recently, four Russian Jewish men traveled from Shanghai to Hong Kong, posing as Portuguese and Polish nationals. The Hong Kong authorities discovered that their passports were forged and issued a deportation order. They also telegraphed the Shanghai police authorities. The General Patrol Bureau investigated and discovered that these men</p>
<p>Were Swindlers</p>
<p>Who usually posed as customers, purchasing small amounts of goods from various businesses and paying with ten-yuan banknotes to get change. After the business gave them change, they would say that they had to choose the banknotes themselves and take the opportunity to steal banknotes. Based on this lead, the investigation revealed that the forger of the passports was</p>
<p>Their Leader</p>
<p>A Russian man named Roganin Shell Air Avalon, also known as Locke, was arrested at the intersection of Bazizi Road and North Sichuan Road at 2 PM the day before yesterday. At his residence at No. 123, Lane 121, Dongyouheng Road, the police found three forged passports and</p>
<p>Chemical Substances</p>
<p>Used for altering banknotes, and brought him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the process and requested an adjournment because the investigation was still ongoing and the four Russian men deported by the Hong Kong authorities had not yet arrived in Shanghai. Judge Dai Rongduo questioned him briefly and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>
<p>Woman Splashed with Corrosive Liquid</p>
<p>At around 2:57 PM yesterday, a young woman named Tian Jishi, 22 years old, was walking on the road at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession when she was suddenly attacked by a thug who splashed a bottle of corrosive liquid on her neck and forehead, damaging her clothing. She was in great pain and fell to the ground, covered in injuries. She screamed for help. Nearby police officers rushed to the scene, but the assailant had already fled. They took the injured woman to the Red Cross Society of China Hospital on Xizang Road for treatment.</p>
<h3>Employee of the Shanghai Gas Company Embezzles; Shanghai Municipal Council Appeals; Dai Hongliang, a Traitor, Sentenced to Six Months</h3>
<p>Dai Hongliang, 40 years old, a native of Shanghai residing at No. 81 Anyi Village, Arabidopsis Road, was a bill collector for the Shanghai Gas Company at No. 656 Yuqiaqing Road. From June of last year to February of this year, he colluded with a Western accountant named Thais (transliteration) to embezzle a total of 33,375.83 yuan. Thais was sentenced to six months in prison by the British Consulate. Dai Hongliang was also arrested and acquitted by the First Special District Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council was dissatisfied with the verdict, and the court ordered Dai to be released on bail. Yesterday, Judge Yu of the Second Branch of the High Court concluded the trial and sentenced Dai Hongliang to six months' imprisonment for joint and continuous embezzlement.</p>
<h3>Flying Thief Wang Zhaorong Commits Numerous Crimes; Two Sacks of Stolen Goods Unearthed</h3>
<p>Wang Zhaorong, a 28-year-old native of Huzhou, is a flying thief who specializes in stealing silverware from the kitchens and living rooms of Western residences in the Western District, using his skills in climbing walls and scaling buildings. He had been punished by the British and French concessions in the past and had disappeared for a long time. Recently, he resumed his old tricks, and thefts from Western merchants' homes in the Western District of the French Concession occurred one after another. Inspector Sui Wenzhi of the French Police managed to arrest Wang and sent him to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention. Details of the investigation have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that during the police investigation, Wang confessed to dozens of crimes, and silver stolen goods amounting to two sacks have been unearthed. It is said that the value of the stolen items reported by the victims is in the tens of thousands of yuan. The person who received the stolen goods has also been arrested and will be tried in the same case in court.</p>
<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Jealousy Leads to Fighting</p>
<p>Chen Axiao, a native of Suzhou residing at No. 238 Yunnan Road, became jealous over a woman in Huile Lane, Guangxi Road, on the afternoon of the 20th of last month. He gathered two or thirty hooligans to beat his rival, Lu Shijin, causing injuries. Chen was arrested and released on bail. Now, the victim, Lu Shijin, has suddenly died from his injuries, so the police have changed the charge against Chen to causing death by injury. The First Special District Court continued the closed-door hearing yesterday, but the defendant avoided appearing in court. The court announced that the case would be adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<p>Robbers Injure People</p>
<p>Last night at 10:30 PM, more than ten robbers, each carrying firearms, suddenly arrived at the home of Shen Shaolian, the former local security officer of Liu Family Lane, Nanshou, Hongqiao Town, in the Shanghai Western District. They broke into the house to rob and severely injured Shen Shaolian, beating him over a hundred times. After the robbery, they went to the home of Wang A'hai, a farmer in Beishou, Wang Genglang, to force him to reveal the location of his hidden silver. Wang had no money, which angered the robbers. They surrounded him, beat him violently, leaving him covered in injuries and unconscious. His life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Case of the Manager of the Anle Palace Hotel Smoking Opium; Chen Zhanxiong Released on Bail; Bribery Still Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Chen Zhanxiong, a Ningbo native who is the owner of the Anle Palace Hotel dance hall on Edouard Road and the manager of the Yiwentai Club on Yuyuan Road in the Shanghai Western District, was arrested by the French police on the 2nd of this month for smoking opium in the Anle Palace. He was sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution and sentenced to six months' imprisonment, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. He was first sent to the detention center for one month to quit his opium addiction. In the detention center, inmates Qin Jiaqi, Tao Yongchang, Chen Jusheng, and others colluded with guards Luo Zhiyi, Jiang Nai, Tu Gang, etc., to extort 150 yuan from Chen, which they divided among themselves. The warden discovered this and reported it to the supervising department, which searched for evidence. Chen Zhanxiong was also charged with bribery, so the case was transferred to the prosecutor's office of the Second Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. The guards Jiang and Tu fled for fear of punishment. Details of these events have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Chen Zhanxiong has completed his opium detoxification in the detention center. The prison doctor reported this to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, which granted permission for him to be released on bail. However, Chen's bribery and the case of extortion by the inmates and guards have been opened for investigation by the prosecutor of the Second Special District Court. Chen Zhanxiong was allowed to be released on 3,000 yuan written bail pending further investigation. Yesterday, Chen's family asked the Dahua Bakery to provide a guarantee. After the court verified and approved it, Chen was released in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Mistake</h3>
<p>— Wan Wen</p>
<p>Whether big mistakes or small mistakes, nobody is without mistakes. Not only do children make mistakes, but adults make mistakes, and even great figures in society are bound to make mistakes. So, having mistakes is not a shameful thing. What is very shameful for children is refusing to admit their mistakes and refusing to correct them.</p>
<p>Why do we make mistakes? Some are made unintentionally, some are made intentionally. Unintentional mistakes are very easy to happen to children because you have less knowledge and less experience. For example, you might write the wrong word or say the wrong sentence, and sometimes you might not even realize it yourself. Once someone points it out, you resolve to pay attention and correct it, and you won't make the mistake again. So, unintentional mistakes can sometimes actually increase our knowledge and gradually reduce the number of mistakes we make. Some mistakes are made intentionally. For example, you know that being dishonest is wrong, but you can't control yourself and you lie, or you take someone else's belongings. If you don't resolve to correct these kinds of mistakes, then you will do this not only in small things in the future, but also in big things. If you have dishonorable behavior, then you will be despised by everyone.</p>
<p>The worst thing is to excuse yourself when you make a mistake and to criticize and ridicule others behind their backs when they make a mistake. Both of these attitudes are wrong. We should always correct our own small mistakes and sincerely point out the mistakes of others to their faces, advising them and encouraging them to resolve not to make the mistakes again. If we learn from each other in this way, our group will be very healthy.</p>
<p>Finally, I offer this saying to children: "Be generous to others, be strict with yourself." I want you to constantly examine your own behavior in your life. Correct small mistakes branch by branch, and even if you encounter difficult things in the future, you won't make mistakes. This is very important for our future success in our careers.</p>
<h3>Children's Telephone Bureau</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>In Moscow's Central Park, the skilled members of the "Archimedes Club" have set up a children's telephone bureau. All the positions in the bureau, from the director to the tea boy, are held by the children themselves. There are a total of eighty telephone lines, connected to various parts of Central Park and the various offices in the park and in the children's village. In addition, there are twenty-five telephone extensions, distributed around the park and in the center. Each extension represents a major Russian city, representing a total of twenty-five important cities. Next to each telephone, a child is waiting. This child is the mayor representing that city. As soon as the general office has an order, it can be announced to the entire park immediately and extremely quickly.</p>
<p>For example, if a disturbance or riot occurs in City A, a telephone call can be made to Cities B and C for assistance. If something unexpected happens in City D, news can be exchanged with Cities C and E. This telephone system cultivates the fundamental foundation for children to serve the country in the future.</p>
<p>At some point, the names of these twenty-five telephones were changed to the capital cities of twenty-five countries. Each child represents a country, communicating with each other on the phone, expressing their opinions and so on. The intention is to have each child use the telephone as a radio station for international communication, so that children develop a friendly international outlook from an early age.</p>

<h3>Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>—— Thirty-Ninth of the Chronicle of Seeking Refuge, Ming Er ——</p>
<p>Three pairs of feet stepped into the county town, and in less than an hour, they had gone from the west end of the county to the east end of the city walls, clearly having walked through the entire town. They then stepped back onto the original road to return home through the west gate of the city. However, their empty baskets were now filled with verdant vegetables – spinach, shepherd's purse, green vegetables, any kind of vegetables were needed. Yet, the three baskets were limited, and no matter how they pressed and stuffed the vegetables into the baskets, many, many vegetables still fell out within the city. They wished they could adopt the strategy of "Let all the vegetables come to me," and buy them all up, carrying them back.</p>
<p>"How is it that this city is finished after only one walk through by us? Such narrow streets, no cars, no sedan chairs, a few small shops, no electric lights, no running water, can this even be called a county town?" On the way home, Ming Er secretly felt indignant on behalf of her prosperous and modern hometown, and seemed to be despising it, saying.</p>
<p>"Don't underestimate it. Although formally it may not meet the conditions of a county town, perhaps in terms of situation, commerce, economy, and military affairs, it has its importance. Have you seen: there is a county government, a bureau of education, a public education center, all very complete, just small. As the saying goes, 'A sparrow may be small, but it has all the vital organs,' this saying matches that county town quite well." The father seemed to be on the side of the county town, defending it as if to protect it. These few words cut off the chatterbox.</p>
<p>At this time, the county town was obscured from their view by small hills. It was evident that they had already traveled a considerable distance from the town. How did the baskets gradually become heavier? When they were buying, they had the mentality that the more the better, pressing and stuffing the items, arranging them very well, the capacity of the baskets was full to the point of being impossible to fill any further. Lifting them up didn't feel too cumbersome. But now it was terrible, after walking for a while, the baskets had gained several pounds, the burden on their arms also increased accordingly, and their feet also became a lot heavier. One hand carried them, and after walking only a few dozen steps, it gave out. The other hand was originally unwilling, but helplessly took over, feeling unbearably heavy, as if a large stone was pressing on the arm, causing it to ache in waves. Such traveling was too exhausting. After all, people are clever: after suffering, they change their approach. They tied the towels to the baskets and carried them on their shoulders, initially feeling quite comfortable, and their arms were much lighter. But with each step the foot took, it seemed that the Earth's center increased its suction force, giving the appearance that the basket on the shoulder was being pulled down to the ground by the suction, therefore the shoulder produced a resisting force, and its burden became heavier.</p>
<p>Although more than half the road had been traveled, the increase in the weight of the baskets had doubled or tripled, and both shoulders had run out of strength to exchange, and the arms had not recovered their original state. Their father's walking stick was then utilized: the three baskets were tied to the center of the walking stick, and carried at both ends, so that one person could walk with empty hands. The person carrying the load on their shoulders also seemed to feel lighter because of the change in method. After walking a stretch of road, they replaced one another, and after traveling another distance, they changed again. With great difficulty, they caught sight of the village where their home was. After turning a few bends, they entered the village area. They thought they were about to reach home, and quickened their pace. However, the more they wanted to get home sooner, the faster they walked, but it seemed like they had walked a very long way. Looking at the roof of their house, there was still a considerable distance to go. They bore with it and walked even faster. At this time, they didn't care much about the pain in their arms or the heaviness in their feet, and ran home with great enthusiasm, each carrying a basket. Finally, they reached home, put down the cumbersome baskets, and let out a long breath. That evening, their mother cooked delicious dishes as a reward for their efforts.</p>
<h3>Children's Amusement Park</h3>
<p>— Jin Ding</p>
<p>Because children are the future masters of the country, the roots of the nation, therefore, our attention to the happiness of children should be promoted in many ways, and "children's recreation" should naturally not be an exception.</p>
<p>The authorities of the New New Company have always made considerable efforts to pay attention to the happiness of children. Recently, after the opening of the New Capital Hotel, it was further stipulated that a "Children's Amusement Park" would be held every Sunday, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, located at the Shanghai Opera Hall on the sixth floor of the New Capital.</p>
<p>Each time the "Children's Amusement Park" is held, the author always brings a few children and goes to participate with great joy. Because they do not sell tickets and absolutely welcome children to participate, the number of children is, of course, a very large part.</p>
<p>In the "Children's Amusement Park," what is performed includes children's broadcasting, speeches, singing, dancing, and valuable educational films. While the films are being shown, they are explained, so that every child can understand the meaning in the films. In addition, performances of martial arts and magic tricks can all inspire children's will to improve and scientific thinking.</p>
<h3>The Blue Dwarf</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>Ah Li, disregarding her uncle's fatigue, continued to ask, "Is this forest the largest in the entire province?" Her uncle, drowsy, didn't hear clearly what Ah Li was asking, and replied casually, "Yes, yes! It's the largest." Ah Li exhaled with surprise and joy, thinking in her heart, "If there really is a dwarf country in the world, then it must be here." Immediately, she raised her voice and said to her uncle, "Uncle, I want to ask you——" Her aunt lazily raised her head and said, "Dear child, be quiet, please. It's best if you take a nap too. This forest is very large, and we still have a long way to go before we leave the forest." Ah Li, hearing these words, was very unhappy and stopped speaking.</p>
<p>Their carriage stopped to rest in a small village in the forest; at that moment, they discovered that a horseshoe on one of the horses had come loose. The villagers came to help, but it was no use. After examining it carefully, they realized that a new horseshoe had to be made. In this way, the group of people could not continue on their way for the time being. The nearest blacksmith shop was two miles away, and the coachman had to take the horse there and bring it back, which would take at least two or three hours. It was already past six o'clock, and they had not yet reached half of their entire journey. The coachman shook his head, saying that he was unwilling to go that night and would have to wait until the next morning to depart. Because the horseshoe had come loose, the horse's foot had been injured. If it was not given sufficient rest, it would inevitably become inflamed. If they left it behind and traveled with only one horse, then the carriage would be too heavy and might not be able to withstand it.</p>
<p>The uncle thought for a moment and suddenly had an idea. He smiled and said to his aunt, "I think just one horse is enough for all of us. Why don't we give it a try?" The aunt hurriedly said, "Why should we force ourselves to travel? It wouldn't matter if we rested here for the night. Fortunately, there are two bedrooms in the small inn, which are very comfortable. As for food, they can probably provide some. We just need some beer, sausages, and yellow bread, and that will be enough."</p>
<p>The uncle agreed, and Ah Li was especially happy, planning to leave immediately, but Ah Li was cold and indifferent and didn't show any indication. The aunt hurriedly said, "Ah Li, are you unwilling to go with us? You didn't doze off in the carriage just now, maybe you're feeling tired?"</p>
<p>Although Ah Li was not tired, because she had other intentions, she told a lie, saying, "Yes, I'm a little tired. If you can forgive me, then I'm willing to stay here and rest. Fortunately, I have books to read, so I won't be lonely, and I also love this area of the forest."</p>
<p>The uncle said, "Then it's fine if you don't go with us, but if you want to take a walk in the forest, be careful not to get lost." He then turned back and said to his aunt, "Don't worry, this area of the forest is very quiet. There are no jackals or tigers, and no robbers or bad people."</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Wireless Cinema</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Wireless cinema has begun to be realized. At the same time, Hollywood film companies have received solid guarantees that after wireless cinema becomes popular, the films produced by Hollywood companies can be supplied in large quantities for broadcasting wireless cinema.</p>
<p>Once wireless cinema becomes popular, the cost of replicating images and sound will be very cheap, and all radio stations can broadcast them without spending a lot of money to broadcast them across the country. All programs can be cataloged in advance and sent to the inspection office for inspection to avoid temporary obstacles.</p>
<p>Once the programs are finalized, they will be filmed by regular film companies with regular movie actors. This can remedy a headache currently felt by Hollywood, which is that movie actors' radio broadcasts and impromptu vocal exercises affect the progress of the company's work.</p>
<p>From the above, we have seen that wireless cinema and the film industry have a mutual relationship. Therefore, after wireless cinema becomes popular, it will not only not affect the film industry, but on the contrary, it can enable film companies to increase the production of films suitable for wireless cinema. I think you readers must be eagerly awaiting this newly invented work to appear before our eyes soon.</p>
<h3>Wang Yaoqing Decides to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— A Man of All Tones</p>
<p>—— Coming South with Wang Yurong ——</p>
<p>The old actor Wang Yaoqing has been separated from the people of Shanghai for a long time. Since performing at the Old Gong Stage in Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, he has never come south for more than ten years. Now, Huang Jin has sent someone to Ping to invite Yaoqing's favorite female disciple Wang Yurong to come south to perform, and has invited the old retainer to come along to see the sights of the isolated island after the disaster that he has not seen in more than ten years. However, because Mr. Wang is old and has motion sickness, he politely declined Huang Jin's invitation. However, Yurong, since entering Wang's school, has become famous in the north and has never returned to her old home. This time, "returning in glory," she also strongly invited her teacher to come south together. At that time, there were two rumors in the Shanghai opera world: one, that Mr. Wang would not necessarily come to Shanghai; and two, that the old retainer would definitely come south. The news was divided and uncertain. Now, I, a humble person, have received news from a "semi-official source" that Yurong has sent a special telegram to someone closest to Yurong (arriving at 7:30 last night), with only twelve characters: "Teacher, after Rong's earnest request, has agreed to depart from Shuntian together." As long as there are no changes along the way, this matter should not go awry. When asked to Huang Jin authorities, they did not acknowledge it, but Yaoqing's coming here will be a playful nature, and whether he will perform on the Huang Jin stage for a few days still needs to be decided after arriving in Shanghai. The Shuntian Wheel has already set sail from Shanghai a few days ago, so the date of the Wang teacher and apprentice's arrival in Shanghai will not be far away. I dare to tell the readers: "Wang Yaoqing has decided to come to Shanghai."</p>
<h3>The Marriage Mystery of the "Um" Girl</h3>
<p>Ann Sheridan, who recently received the title of "Um Girl," is one of Hollywood's brightest new stars. Her transcendent beauty can make people lose their souls at first sight. Therefore, there are countless young men who are enamored with her. Even old gentlemen over forty cannot help but admit that she is a lovely person that they have never seen or heard of. American speculators have all come up with ideas to use Ann Sheridan's beautiful name as a slogan for goods or stores, such as Sheridan Socks, Sheridan Pants, Ann Sheridan Cafe, and Sheridan Ice Cream, which are everywhere. Every commodity or store, just by adding Ann Sheridan's name, will make a profit three times over. From this, we can see the general public's infatuation with Ann Sheridan!</p>
<p>Miss Ann is twenty-two years old this year. She was born in Texas, USA. Her ancestors' blood contains Scottish, Irish, and Indian elements. This is what has created Miss Ann's unique beauty today. She was previously married to a movie actor, but soon announced their divorce. Until now, she has not found a new sweetheart. Therefore, the men who worship her, whether they know her or not, often send her letters proposing marriage. There are at least four hundred such letters every day, but Miss Ann never replies and simply throws them into the wastepaper basket. This is not because Miss Ann is unfeeling, but it is said that because she plans to remain single! Although recently she and actor Shelley Romiro have often been seen going in and out together and their relationship seems very close, Miss Ann absolutely denies that there is a romance. What will happen in the end? We can only wait for the next episode! (De Gang)</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>Until the Day We Meet Again (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"When Tomorrow Comes"</p>
<p>The acting skills of Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne had already left a deep impression in "Love Affair." This second collaboration in "Until the Day We Meet Again" still maintains their past achievements. I think the best scenes are: (1) After coming out of the church, Charles Boyer is going to see his wife, and asks Irene Dunne if she wants to see her. Irene Dunne shakes her head. After Charles Boyer leaves, she quietly boards a bus to New York. (2) Charles Boyer sends Irene Dunne off the bus and revisits Irene Dunne. (3) Barbara O'Neil visits Irene Dunne. (4) Their final separation: "I will come back," Charles Boyer says; "I will wait for you," Irene Dunne replies. In this scene, although they are consistently plain and steady, the conflict and contradiction of their psychological states are revealed in their words.</p>
<p>Having gotten used to the Hollywood movies with high-speed romance techniques, such a movie like "Until the Day We Meet Again" (although it is also a love story), whether it is the directing technique, the actors' acting skills, or the photography and lighting (when lighting candles in the church), is worth learning from.</p>
<h3>Yu Wedding Repertoire</h3>
<p>— Yu Gong</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing's eldest grandson, Ji Yun's, wedding has a grand celebration, as recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is said that the person in charge of arranging the plays is Mr. Jin Tingsun, the owner of the Huang Jin Grand Theater. In fact, Mr. Jin is the general manager of the Yu wedding, and all affairs are entrusted to Sun Lanting, Wu Jiangfeng, Zhai Qijun, Zhao Peixin, and his literary companion, Jin Yuansheng, etc., to handle. The repertoire for the day (i.e., tomorrow) has been completely assigned. The curtain will rise at 2:00 PM. Li Fuchun and Wang Xiaoqiao's Great Blessing, Liu Hanchen (formerly Qiao Xuan, later Zhang Fei), Xue Youqin (Sun Shangxiang), Gao Xueqiao (Zhao Yun), and Xu Hongpei (Liu Bei) will perform the complete Ganlu Temple, Returning to Jingzhou, and Reed Flower Marsh. Zhang Shulan and Liang Yiming's Golden Horse Hoof, Xiao Xiao Wang Guiqing, Xiao Er Wang Guiqing, and Xiao San Wang Guiqing's Small Water Curtain Cave, Wu Suqiu, Han Jinkui, and Sun Yaofang's Spring Fragrance Makes Trouble at School, Xiao Linghong, Gai Sanxing, and Zhao Zhiqiu's Picking Jade Bracelet, Hu Peixin, Li Kechang, and Wang Qijun's Catching Cao and Lodging at an Inn, Zhang Shuxian, Li Junyu, and Chu Zhihua's Xin'an Post, Zhou Xinfang, Hu Ruquan, and Yuan Shihai's Battle of Changsha, Song Dezhu, Furong Cao, and the entire Song Troupe's Jinshan Temple. The above repertoires are all complete full-length pieces, performed from beginning to end. It is estimated that the performance will last until dawn. Later, Yang Baosen of Huang Jin, Wang Shaolou of the Gong Stage, and Gao Baishui of Carlton had all joined, but due to time constraints, they could only politely decline. Such a good show, with the costume team being Han Jinkui's Jin Yutang, it is thought that not only will the New Capital Hotel be bustling tonight, but Han Jinkui will also be too busy to cope.</p>
<h3>Chatting about Zhao Jinrong</h3>
<p>— Ni Qiuping</p>
<p>This time, inviting new performers to come and perform in phases is really special. Zhao Jinrong is the performer who will take the stage in the second phase. People in Shanghai are probably a little unfamiliar with her. Speaking of it, Jinrong had a very bad experience, losing her father at the age of nine. She entered the opera school at the age of thirteen and graduated in 1937 (one year earlier than Hou Yulan). This school later formed its own troupe, and those good performers such as Jiang Miaoxiang, Li Duokui, and Chen Shaolin were all by her side, and they had very good luck in the old capital. In addition to studying at the opera school, she has also sought advice from her teacher Wang Yaoqing. As for the Mei style (such as Luo Shen and Phoenix Returns to Its Nest), it was taught by Xu Lanyuan. Recently, someone suggested that Yu Rong should become a disciple of Mr. Guo Xiaoqing. Mr. Guo once replied, "Anything that can be done is fine, there is nothing that can't be done." In this way, there probably won't be any problems. I once chatted with Jinrong about various opera stories and art, and she answered them fluently and was very modest. I have an experience with modest people - the more they earn, the greater their ability. Zhao Jinrong is indeed a rising star.</p>
<p>Zhao Jinrong studies Qingyi and Huadan; half of her singing style is from Cheng and half from Mei. There are the most people studying Mei and Cheng, but as for what they learn to, that all depends on themselves. I hope Jinrong will strive for it.</p>
<p>News from the Art World: A brand new, all-encompassing publication, "Art World," will appear at the end of this year.

<h3>Italy's Foreign Policy in Observation</h3>
<p>— Du Xing</p>
<p>Hesitating Between Two Groups Without a Decision, Remaining on the Side of Victory Is Still Its Consistent Style</p>
<p>Mussolini has always been more stable than Hitler. Since Italy declared its neutrality, he has been in constant communication with German messengers on one hand, and frequently sending overtures to Britain and France on the other. After Poland was divided up, Russia's power had already approached the Balkan Peninsula. We can see his anxiety from Mussolini's calm mind.</p>
<p>Italy Feels Threatened</p>
<p>In fact, there are unspeakable reasons for Mussolini's declaration of neutrality. He knows that Hitler is hiding behind his Western Front fortress, which does not hinder his position for the time being. However, Mussolini's own position is at the place in the world with the most intense firepower. If he leans towards Hitler, military action will immediately cause northern Italy to be ravaged by the French army, and the joint British-French Mediterranean fleet will not be difficult to destroy coastal cities in Italy. Turkey would also be able to attack Italy from Greece from behind.</p>
<p>Friends in Need Break Up</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are many reasons that make Mussolini feel deeply troubled. Mussolini has experts and military personnel hired from Hitler. However, this time Hitler disregarded his long-suffering friend and colluded with Stalin, which was quite an insult to Fascism! In this way, Mussolini cannot call on General Franco to attack France from behind in Spain. At the same time, Italy is a poor country. Although Mussolini can send his people to the front lines, who in Italy is willing to fight honestly? Therefore, Mussolini's declaration of neutrality is actually his logical and consistent action, and it is inevitable. He is also afraid that the Soviet Union and Germany will take advantage of their victorious power to expand into the Balkans, which is also intolerable to Mussolini, which is why he is uneasy and unwilling to think and act like Hitler.</p>
<p>However, under the current situation, can Mussolini's neutrality last long? Will the expansion of Soviet power into the Balkan Peninsula shake Italy's neutral position? Italy used to be a springboard for the German Emperor in 1915. Who can guarantee that Mussolini will not sabotage Hitler this time? Regarding this, Mussolini has firmly denied that he has any dissent with Hitler. However, we must not ignore the pressure that Britain and France have put on Mussolini. Since the outbreak of the war, the frequent guests in the office of Mussolini's son-in-law, Foreign Minister Ciano, have been the British and French ambassadors to Italy. Recently, Italy's new ambassador to the UK took office and held secret talks with British Foreign Secretary Halifax. It is said that he has an important mission from Mussolini. From this, we can see the direction Mussolini is taking. At present, he is conservative in maintaining neutrality, but he is just copying the old tricks of the last war, and the result is that he will inevitably jump into the fire.</p>
<p>Let's look at Mussolini. Before declaring neutrality, he also pretended, as if he was going to work with his partner Hitler. After Hitler fired the first shot at Poland, he immediately implemented very detailed mobilization work, making his people restless; the whole country implemented a blackout, coffee was only allowed to be sold to soldiers, only state organs had the right to use gasoline, and all private car travel was prohibited after September 3. Later, the decision of neutrality was made, and the terrifying atmosphere was relaxed. Mussolini only has one sentence: "If Italy is attacked, it will resist immediately." In fact, only he attacks others, and others will never attack him. He also divided his troops under the command of General Graziani and Crown Prince Umberto. The former has always had no good feelings for Hitler, while the latter is supported by the Italian people. From this, we can see what Mussolini's intentions are.</p>
<p>Still a Fence-Sitting Policy</p>
<p>Now, Italy is bright at night again, and foreign mail is also arriving on time. Italian troops have been withdrawn from the border between Libya and Egypt, and the Italian garrison at the border between Albania and Greece has also been reduced. The French border has been reopened. However, Mussolini has not yet opened the mountain roads leading to Germany; on the one hand, under the close supervision of Britain and France, goods have also stopped being transported from Italy to Germany.</p>
<p>Mussolini's declaration of neutrality is like building a wall in Romania; protecting the countries of the Balkan Peninsula; on the other hand, he is sitting on the wall, looking at the artillery fire on the German-French border and the evolution of the world situation with a telescope, watching who has the upper hand, and when he sees it clearly, he will immediately take action.</p>
<h3>A Corner of the Battlefield: A Glimpse of Occupied Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Song Sheng</p>
<p>Deathly Still, Devoid of Life</p>
<p>The State of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway After the Bombing</p>
<p>Hangzhou—my hometown! Since being trampled by the iron hooves [of the invaders], everything has changed. The beautiful West Lake seems to have suffered great humiliation, and has been neglected and forgotten by people. The world-famous Qiantang River tidal bore is no longer appreciated or viewed. Foreign warriors have replaced poets and literati, and the clattering of machine guns has replaced the evening bells of temples. The city is deathly still, devoid of life. Although many people have recently moved back to their old homes, reaching a quarter of the pre-war population, everyone is gloomy and appears to be in a state between laughter and tears. In the most prosperous areas of the city, strangely dressed women in kimonos often stroll back and forth. The New Market is not as lively as before. At night, the entire city of Hangzhou has only sparse, ghastly green electric lights flickering like will-o'-the-wisps, symbolizing the terrible ghost world it has become.</p>
<p>I have not returned to my hometown for several years. I don't want to go, and I'm afraid to go, but because it is my hometown, and many relatives and friends are trapped inside, I always wanted an opportunity to visit and decide [what to do]. Recently, I made a firm decision to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train before Double Ten Day [October 10th].</p>
<p>The Infighting of Traitors</p>
<p>The inspection along the way was very strict. According to a fellow traveler, "It is because of a shooting incident in the city a few days ago. Now, nobody knows how many guerrillas have infiltrated Hangzhou—two or three thousand at most, six or seven hundred at least. No one knows the exact number, so the Japanese are extremely afraid!" Later, I learned that the person killed was the secret service chief of the Japanese military police, named Yu Xiangzhen. The murderer was his subordinate, named Ren Zhifa, also a secret agent. They had a disagreement over extorting money. During a banquet, Ren took Yu by surprise and fired several shots. Yu fell to the ground wounded. As he was being sent to the hospital, he shouted, "Ren is the one who killed me! Avenge me quickly!" The Japanese army immediately arrested Ren and prepared to behead him on the day I arrived in Hangzhou. The next day, they arrested more than ten people in succession. One of them was deemed involved in the case because he looked panicked during the arrest and was executed. But most people believe that he was wrongly killed.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Empty City Stratagem</p>
<p>The Japanese army stationed in Hangzhou also knew that many guerrillas were lurking in the city, so they dared not leave their fortifications at night. Even during the day, they would not walk in secluded streets and alleys unless they were in groups of more than ten. It is said that more than one incident of a small number of Japanese soldiers being killed in secluded alleys has already occurred. Not only that, because the war at the front was tight, some Japanese soldiers were transferred to the front line, and some did not want to go to the front line again, so many hanged themselves in despair, and many of them were officers. This shows the war-weariness of the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>Because the rear was empty and there were no soldiers to transfer, the Japanese army came up with a clever "empty city" stratagem. Sometimes no Japanese soldiers could be seen, and sometimes thousands would gather. The fact of the matter was that they did not have enough troops to allocate and had to use the transportation lines to unite the Japanese troops from various places. They would come here today and go there tomorrow, making people think that there were strong garrisons everywhere. In fact, it was just these same few Japanese soldiers moving back and forth. In addition, clear machine gun fire could often be heard during the day or at night, but it was nothing more than a show of force to prevent the guerrillas from attacking from time to time.</p>
<p>Imitation Japanese Women</p>
<p>In the areas near the city station and the New Market, one could often see Japanese women sitting in rickshaws, looking around with pride. At first, I didn't understand why there were so many Japanese women in Hangzhou. Later, I learned that these were not real Japanese women, but Chinese women pretending to be Japanese. Some of them were offered as "comfort items" to the "Imperial Army" by traitors, and some were forced to marry traitors as concubines due to environmental coercion and the difficulties of life. The bad people who used to commit all kinds of evils in Hangzhou are now all high-ranking officials, and all have three wives and four concubines. And in order to learn the latest fashion, and to show off to their peers, they all dress up in Japanese attire.</p>
<p>The State of the Railway After the Bombing</p>
<p>I only stayed for four days and wanted to leave Hangzhou, but my relatives and friends insisted on me staying for another day. Fortunately, I stayed another day, otherwise I would have run into the guerrilla bombing of the railway, and I might not have been able to return to Shanghai. That day, October 7th, news came in the afternoon that the railway near Chang'an had been bombed and many people were killed or injured. At that time, I was very worried that the train would not be able to pass, and I would be trapped in Hangzhou. Fortunately, I went to catch the train early the next morning, and the train was still running. When we arrived at Xucun, the train suddenly stopped. At that time, I didn't know why. After about an hour, the train started moving again. When we arrived at a deserted place, we saw that four sections of the train that had been bombed yesterday were lying on their backs by the side of the road. On one side was the train head, which had been badly damaged. Many coolies were standing on the road, rushing to repair the railway. Only then did I realize that the reason why the train had stopped just now was because the tracks had not been repaired. It had been a full twenty-four hours since the bombing yesterday morning, and the railway had not yet been repaired, which shows how violent the bombing was. The Japanese suffered a great loss this time. Although the Japanese side kept the number of dead and wounded a secret, each car and section was guarded by an average of six or seven Japanese soldiers, so at least twenty or more Japanese soldiers were killed or injured. The number of passengers killed or injured was many times that.</p>
<h3>From Tibetan Yellow Buddhism to the Enthronement of the New Dalai Lama</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shan</p>
<p>Dalai and Panchen</p>
<p>Tibetan religion is divided into two sects: Red Sect and Yellow Sect, which are originally a branch of Buddhism. Since the rise of the Yellow Sect, the Red Sect has declined. The ancestor of the Yellow Sect was Tsongkhapa. When he passed away, he left a will to his two great disciples, who would be reincarnated generation after generation to inherit his mantle, one being the Dalai Lama and the other being the Panchen Lama. According to Tibetan beliefs, the Dalai Lama is the incarnation of Avalokiteśvara, and the Panchen Lama is the incarnation of Amitābha. When they are reborn, they become each other's teachers. But in terms of power, the Dalai Lama is the political and religious leader of Tibet, while the Panchen Lama is only the religious leader, and ultimately not as powerful as the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p>The Successive Dalai Lamas</p>
<p>The first Dalai Lama was born in the 24th year of the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty [1391], and the most recently reincarnated Dalai Lama is the fourteenth. Among them, the fifth Dalai Lama had the highest morality and learning, and the thirteenth Dalai Lama had the greatest political and religious power. The fifth Dalai Lama was deeply versed in karma and once predicted, "If the fourteenth Dalai Lama is reincarnated in Qinghai, then his morality and learning will be higher than that of the fifth." Now the fourteenth Dalai Lama has indeed been found in Qinghai, so the Tibetan people have high expectations for him. The thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away on December 17th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China [1933], and his reincarnated body was only found last year in Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai. It took a full five years, and the lamas in charge went to great lengths and endured many hardships to find our new master.</p>
<p>The Method of Viewing the Sea for Guidance</p>
<p>Originally, according to Tibetan tradition, the Dalai Lama would be reborn as an infant forty-five days after his passing. Before the ninth Dalai Lama, each Dalai Lama would specify the place of his rebirth when he passed away, but after that, there was only the so-called method of "viewing the sea for guidance" to identify the place of the new Dalai Lama's rebirth. What is called "viewing the sea for guidance"? Originally, this ceremony was held at Tengri Lake near Lhasa. During the ceremony, a phenomenon similar to a "mirage" would occur on the surface of the sea. This was the spiritual indication, which could be recorded in detail as the basis for the location of the next Dalai Lama's reincarnation. After the thirteenth Dalai Lama passed away, the Regent of Tibet, Reting Rinpoche (a great lama who can be reincarnated is called a Rinpoche), followed the custom and held the "viewing the sea" ceremony. It is said that because the scenery displayed each time was not clear, it was performed hundreds of times before the environment of the new Dalai Lama's birthplace was discovered in May of the 25th year of the Republic of China [1936] to be "a large temple covered with glazed tiles, with a Mongolian yurt next to it." But although there are large temples with glazed tiles in Tibet, there are no Mongolian yurts. Therefore, it was speculated that the fifth Dalai Lama's prophecy might come true, and lamas were dispatched to search the border areas of Qinghai and Mongolia. (According to another account, during the last "viewing the sea for guidance," a place appeared in the sea with complex ethnic groups and different costumes, as well as three Tibetan characters, meaning Kumbum Monastery.)</p>
<p>The New Dalai Lama Is Found</p>
<p>When these lamas arrived in Gannan the year before last, the Panchen Lama happened to be in the area and gave some instructions regarding the search for the Dalai Lama's reincarnation. The lamas followed his instructions and rushed to Qinghai. Sure enough, they found the fourteenth Dalai Lama, currently five years old, at the home of a local in Hongtu Cliff near Kumbum Monastery. It is said that although the new Dalai Lama is a young child, he is outstanding and dignified, and his eyes are bright and full of energy. On July 13th of this year, Ma Yuanhai, the Special Envoy of the National Government, and the lamas who were Special Envoys of the Tibetan side, escorted him from Kumbum Monastery and set off to return to Tibet. He will soon be enthroned in Lhasa. The National Government has specially appointed Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, to go to Tibet to preside over the ceremony with Reting. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 18th of this month, Wu had already taken a plane to Hanoi on that day and will travel to Tibet via India.</p>

<h3>Today's Berlin</h3>
<p>— Song Zhou</p>
<p>Everything Requires Coupons</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War, Berlin, the capital of Germany, adopted a coupon system to control food and daily necessities. By October, it was in full swing. Bread was bought with red coupons, butter with yellow coupons, and meat with green coupons. There were also fruit jam coupons and soap coupons, in a riot of colors. Anyone who did not bring these coupons could not buy what they needed. Food was marked with the words "fifty grams" or "one hundred grams," and cut according to the coupon. The coupons were valid for one week. Everyone looked a little anxious when they saw that they were about to run out.</p>
<p>Since October, many people have not been able to taste eggs, no matter how much money they have. The rich and the poor are treated the same, which can be said to be German-style communism.</p>
<p>One Pair of Shoes a Month Everything requires coupons. Buying towels, clothes, and leather shoes is the same. What is even more ridiculous is that you can only buy one shoe a month, and it takes two months to buy a pair.</p>
<p>Night Light Badges on the Chest Because of the blackout implemented to prevent air raids, the streets are completely dark, but in order to avoid collisions with each other, pedestrians mostly have badges coated with luminescent paint, hung on their chests, like fireflies. The glowing flowers, as accessories for passersby, also have a unique flavor.</p>
<p>Newspapers Not Sold at Night</p>
<p>Newspapers are sold out during the day and not sold at night. The general public is very concerned about politics and diplomacy. The maids at work often read the newspaper as they walk. They no longer love to read novels as they used to, but want to know the news about war and diplomacy. They want to know, is it still war, or is it peace, is it still Chamberlain, or who else?" They are very interested in Hitler's speech and want to know Chamberlain's response. But the German newspapers do not mention a word about the British response. They only report how the various neutral countries approve and welcome Hitler's speech.</p>
<p>The European War Unfolds, Two Powers Compete</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Goods—Buyers Must Pay More Attention—</h3>
<p>The market is currently flooded with counterfeit goods. If our compatriots have some ability to distinguish them, they can tell them apart and avoid buying them. Now, according to the materials we have collected, we will tell you their characteristics:</p>
<p>1. Almost every trademark has a certain symbolic picture, often a very bright red rising sun, or uses a picture to show its power. For example, the Big Star brand depicts a woman in a suit, stepping on the northeast corner of the earth (i.e., the position of our four northeastern provinces), raising her hands to pursue the painted five-pointed star.</p>
<p>2. There are anti-propaganda pictures. For example, the Dinghua brand's Dinghua picture is a good example of anti-propaganda. It shows two soldiers holding a horizontally placed map of China. On the tripod next to the soldiers, there is Yue Fei's cry of "Return My Rivers and Mountains" arranged like a cigarette, indicating that returning our rivers and mountains is as illusory as white smoke, dissipating and vanishing, just a dream. Some matches are also printed with the slogan "North and South Unity."</p>
<p>3. Trademarks often contain anesthetic meanings, such as most of the trademarks that depict ancient and modern beauties, the God of Longevity, the lives of ancient nobles, the emperor's ascension to the throne, etc., the purpose of which is to anesthetize, fossilize, and corrupt our thoughts.</p>
<p>4. The trademark text is ungrammatical. For example, "Double Golden Horse" is written as "Golden Double Horse," and "41 Code" is written as English "Code 41." This is clearly not our country's usual practice and has the smell of a certain country's grammar.</p>
<p>5. The trademark has no registration number from the Ministry of Industry, only "NO," with no number behind it, such as the Oriental Great Port brand.</p>
<p>6. Several places can be easily distinguished from the trademark paper: 1. The paper quality is worse than foreign goods; 2. The ink can penetrate the back of the paper; 3. The color is less bright; 4. If there is a gold-plated edge, the gold will be wiped off with a light touch.</p>
<p>The above is only from the perspective of trademarks. As for the factory number, it can also be seen.</p>
<p>7. Counterfeit goods often use strange names such as "Daily New Addition" and "Daily New Chang" for the factory number name. The number of words in the factory name is often odd, such as Heng Yuansheng, Da Xinzhen, etc. The name "Cotton Cloth Number" is often used under the factory name, which is rarely seen in our country.</p>
<p>8. Most of the factory addresses are in Shanghai, and most are in Zhabei, Liuying Road, etc.</p>
<p>However, unscrupulous merchants are extremely cunning. Once their fake sign is exposed, they immediately change it. Recently, it has been discovered that a bolt of cloth or a skein of foreign yarn often has six or seven kinds of signs. Some unscrupulous merchants do not need a trademark at all. This proves that trademark identification alone is not enough. The more reliable way is to inspect the quality of the goods. The quality of the goods is low, not durable, and easily fades. For example, the recently counterfeited Danshilin cloth has this situation.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Celebrities: General Feng Yuxiang</h3>
<p>— Han Ruo</p>
<p>A few years ago, when the Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission was recuperating in Mount Tai, the Lytton Commission sent by the League of Nations happened to come to China. When the investigation team passed through Tai'an, they also went to Mount Tai for a few days. One of the members lost his walking stick, so he questioned the magistrate of Tai'an and asked the magistrate to be responsible for finding it. The magistrate had no choice but to detain the sedan bearers to search. When General Feng heard this, he was furious and immediately wrote a letter to the magistrate, Zhou Baihuang, saying that he did not understand the situation and should not have agreed to find a cane for the investigation team. The reasons were: (1) The cane is a personal item, and even if it is lost, it is due to carelessness, and (2) the investigation team cannot prove that the cane was lost in Mount Tai. The investigation team had long heard of his old gentleman's great name and wanted to meet him, so they asked the reception staff to notify him. However, he refused to meet them, saying that he was ill and could not see guests. Someone said, "Mr. Feng, you are in good health. Why don't you meet this noble investigation team?" He said, "China has such a large territory and so many people. There is foreign aggression but no resistance. When we lose our territory, we go to others to beg for mercy. I am a strong soldier, but I cannot take up arms to defend my country. What face do I have to meet people? At the same time, even if the Lytton Commission achieves something, it cannot uphold justice and return our territory, so I am really ashamed to see them."</p>
<h3>Scientific Life: A Discourse on Nutrition</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>After a person is born and lands on the ground crying, he needs food to maintain life. He needs to consume 2700 to 2800 calories of heat every day. So, what should he eat to generate so much heat? The muscles, liver, and kidneys in the human body can perform metabolism to generate heat. To promote metabolism, the original driving force is the three nutrients in living things: protein, fat, and carbohydrates. The heat generated by each nutrient maintains people's lives. Our daily standard food consumption is estimated to be 52.5 grams of protein (one gram per kilogram of body weight), 50.0 grams of fat, 500.0 grams of carbohydrates, 17.0 grams of salts, 0.1 grams of vitamins, and 200.0 grams of water. Assuming that a person lives for sixty years, the food consumed is estimated to be 200 pigs, 400 chickens, 5,000 fish, 56,000 kilograms of vegetables, 10,400 kilograms of rice, 3,000 kilograms of sugar, 500 kilograms of salt, 1,500 liters of wine, 7,000 kilograms of fruit, 400,000 cigarettes, and 10,000 liters of water. A person needs this amount to maintain his vitality throughout his life. After seeing these statistics, we should be vigilant, not waste it lightly, and not just be a "manure-making machine". We must do some work that benefits the public and live a meaningful life.</p>
<h3>New Invention in the Medical Field—Cancer Testing Method</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Simple and Effective</p>
<p>Cancer is one of the most difficult diseases to treat. In the past, testing patients for cancer was extremely troublesome, but recently, Dr. Ge Laisi Gen, a professor of cancer and cancer expert at Dingboer Medical School in Philadelphia, USA, discovered a brand-new testing method that is simple and effective. It is said to be 90% accurate. The method involves extracting the pancreas and liver from animal fetuses, extracting a special substance, subjecting it to special treatment, and making it into a liquid. A subcutaneous injection is given to the test subject. If the patient has cancer, the injection site will turn red and grow flesh thorns. If there is no cancer, there will be no such signs at all.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Grice Gen's explanation, although cancer cells are similar to ordinary cells, their developmental power is particularly strong, just like the cells of a fetus, but after development, they do not become useful tissues. If a person has cancer, the entire body is particularly sensitive to the same kind of cells. Therefore, in vitro, injecting fetal cells will cause a reaction and have the above-mentioned symptoms.</p>
<h3>Recycling Waste Materials</h3>
<p>— Jing Hua</p>
<p>Now that prices are high, people's living expenses have increased, and everything must be implemented frugally. Being able to think of recycling waste materials is very much in line with the purpose of thrift. Now there are several wastes that can be turned into useful things after manufacturing:</p>
<p>Making Alkali from Wood Charcoal Ash</p>
<p>Take out the wood charcoal ash burned in the stove and soak it in water. After a day, use the clear liquid on top to wash clothes to remove oil stains. If the clear liquid is boiled dry, the resulting crystals are alkali. Dissolving it in water will become alkaline water. The ash of broad bean shells can also be used to produce alkaline substances in the same way.</p>
<p>Making Paper from Rags and Bagasse</p>
<p>First, wash the rags and bagasse with water, then cook them with caustic soda, and then put them into a mortar and pound them into a pulp. Spread it thinly on a bamboo curtain and dry it over a fire to make rough paper.</p>
<p>Growing Mushrooms from Rice Straw</p>
<p>First, cut the rice straw stalks into pieces, mix them with a bowl of glutinous rice paste and a pile of horse manure, place them on a plate, and punch small holes around it. Water it during the day, and after four weeks, straw mushrooms will grow.</p>
<p>There are many things that can be recycled from waste materials. The above are just three examples. I hope that people from all walks of life will publish more of their experiences.</p>
<h3>Strange News: Raising Snakes to Catch Mice</h3>
<p>In Chilean homes, the work of catching mice is done by snakes. This kind of snake is a small python and is not poisonous. During the day, these snakes are quiet and sleepy, but at dusk, they gradually become active, swimming around and looking for mice. Holes are made in the beams of the houses for them to enter and exit. When someone goes to rent a house, the landlord sometimes boasts of their liveliness and ability to catch mice as one of the advantages of the house.</p>
<p>A stranger traveling to Chile came down from his room one night and saw a large snake coiled on the mat at the bottom of the stairs. He was so frightened that he turned around and called for help. Everyone in the house ran out, thinking something had happened. After explaining the situation, they laughed and said, "This is just 'Pete Ba', our mouser." One of them grabbed its tail and threw it aside.</p>
<p>The women there often carry small snakes in their skirts and play with them, just like we carry kittens and play with them. Cantonese people use snakes and cats as dishes, calling them "Dragon and Tiger Meet". Now Chile uses snakes instead of cats to catch mice. In this way, not only are the tastes of snakes and cats both excellent, but they can also perform the same work. This is really amazing!</p>
<h3>After Reading "Talking About the Hongmen on National Day"</h3>
<p>— A Member of the Hongmen</p>
<p>The Hongmen is absolutely secret, and few people know its details. Now it is openly recorded as history and geography. Although it is only a glimpse, its fighting spirit and stance are revealed without reservation. The author's self-proclaimed Sangyu, whether it is "losing in the east corner, gaining in the mulberry elm", or considering the name and meaning, it contains encouragement and approval. All Hongmen people must be moved by this and become more excited. However, when it comes to the relationship between the Hongmen and the Kuomintang, there are slight discrepancies with the facts. Simply put: the predecessor of the Kuomintang was the Tongmenghui, the predecessor of the Tongmenghui was the Xingzhonghui, and the Xingzhonghui was the entire organization of the Hongmen. The late Premier Sun was the leader of the Zhigongtang and the President of the Xingzhonghui. For example, the "oath", "internal and external slogans", "Grand Governor"... of the Kuomintang all used the old names from more than 300 years ago in the Hongmen.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the more than 200 years of wars with the Qing Dynasty, except for the two Hui-Zhun campaigns, the Hongmen took the initiative in almost all of them. The most notable ones were: the Red Flower Pavilion, the Greater and Lesser Jinchuan, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, and the Wuhan Uprising. All of these battles were led by the Hongmen Governors. Because the Governors complied with the Hongmen's creed of not fighting for power after success. The Hongmen was originally a secret organization for "overthrowing the Qing and restoring the Ming" and "reviving the Han and destroying the Manchu", a national revolution. After the founding of the Republic of China, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was destroyed and the target was lost, so it should be disbanded. This has been a big question for Chinese and foreign people for more than 20 years. It must be known that the reason why the Xinhai Revolution succeeded so quickly was because the Hongmen martyrs saw that the Manchu Qing was mediocre, frequently invited foreign aggression, lost power and humiliated the country, and was on the verge of extinction. Therefore, the various mountains at home and abroad unanimously mobilized to overthrow the Manchu Qing, which only achieved the preliminary work. In the spring of Renzi [1912], the Hongmen General Assembly decided to expand the "Han ethnic group" into a revolutionary society for the five ethnic groups (i.e., the national ethnic group), and established the United General Assembly in Shanghai. Still based on the old organization and discipline, it carried out a new national revival movement. In the past "May 30th" and "January 28th" and other campaigns, the blood and soul of the Hongmen automatically made a large contribution, and the blood and soul scattered on the front lines are not known how many? The so-called National Day is the "National Memorial Day" of the Hongmen. After reading "Talking About the Hongmen on National Day", I wrote this to express my grief and indignation.</p>
