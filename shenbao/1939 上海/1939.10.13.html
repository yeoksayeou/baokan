<p>論全局，有得先簡單說明者二：中國對日抗戰，閱二十八月而至今日，若放棄抗戰，則日本確已深入而中國爲敗績；若繼續抗戰，則中國正在轉敗爲勝之初期，離最後勝利愈近。故最近蔣總裁所昭吿軍民者，於制勝則明示把握而絕不掉以輕心，於赴戰則勗以艱苦犧牲而是仁愛溢於言表，此爲中國軍民所悅服也，此一方面也。日本對華侵略，以廿八閱月之經騐與敎訓，確已放棄其武力征服之奢望，且已覺悟武力侵略之無以爲繼；此後形勢日非，國內外一切弱點，必暴露愈多，亦不利愈甚。彼豈不知憣然改圖，歛兵東歸，保全殘餘實力，猶足稱雄，對華修好言歡，始爲上策；祗以上無魄力偉大之政家爲首相，倒挽狂瀾，下無忠貞篤實之論家爲領導，穩定輿情，遂取下策。下策者，用竭於內，師疲於外；內則束縛其人民如積薪而自居其上，外則以脅誘役使傀儡，謀以武力所不能勝者勝以欺騙，武力所不能致者致以欺騙。其實在武力佔領區域之中，佔領時期之中內，何求不得；所得何足欺世，信爲可欺，是自欺耳；自欺自誤，故曰下策，此又一方面也。中日兩方今日之情况若此。</p>
<p>居今日而論今後之推移，最後之結局，則吾人以爲至少可以斷言日本侵略終吿失敗。由今日至最後，或推移如直綫，或推移以波折，此則未可逆觀；顧亦有可得而言者，雙方當局而能把握其定職與定力，則波折愈少，亦即精神物質時間，其不必要之損耗愈少。此在中國方面，非至國家主權領土確得完整，民族及其政治外交確保自由，決不放棄抗戰，是不待言；至於自轉爲勝之初期，以迄最后勝利之確定，其間距離，誰不殷願縮至最短，然亦必步步爲營，穩紮穩打；若以迫不及待之情緒，務勝務速，則最有增加不必要之波折之可能，是應戒也。例如一週以來，前方捷報頻傳，聞者稱快，然如何　漢，此非僅恃一鼓作氣足以赴之，而有待周詳擘畫。總之，今後要在徐圖每戰必勝，非求速戰速勝，此爲把握直綫之推移。</p>
<p>此在日本方面，今猶不足以語此。證以最近湘贛會戰之後，日本力竭聲嘶以諱敗，可知日本不惟於政治上務自欺，抑且於軍事上喪其最低限度之自信。何以謂喪自信？自信者視勝敗爲常事，謀勝而不諱敗；諱敗者，一切弱點之欲蓋彌彰。何以謂彼諱敗？據中國方面之戰訉：日軍自九月中旬佯攻，下旬總攻；及本月初，華軍漸入優勢，全綫反攻，五日克冶城，十日克修水，爾後續有進展，恢復九月下旬之戰綫而過之；夫爲戰勝何疑。乃日方於本月十日發出戰訉，累二千言，號稱大勝；浮誇虛妄之辭，姑置勿論，其間第一節述「洞庭湖强行登陸部隊」則報吿至九月廿九日爲止，第二節述「南進部隊」則報吿至九月三十日爲止，第三節述「平江攻略部隊」則報吿至九月廿八日爲止，第四節述「通城南下部隊」亦報吿至九月廿九日爲止，第五節述「九嶺山系部隊」無月日者不據；其結論稱「悠然納鋒，以養銳氣；」戰訉發於本月十日，而於十日內事一字不提，諱其敗曰「悠然納鋒。」核以兩方報吿之月日，日方戰敗何疑。</p>
<p>中國戰爭之全局，最後勝敗，有其不可抗違之條件在焉，茲不申論；若論湘贛間之此次會戰，中國雖勝，日本雖敗，却非決定中日勝敗之主要戰鬬，然則何以日本諱莫如深？蓋其一般原因，無非錮蔽其軍民之耳目，以冀勉强維繫其頽喪欲絕之士氣民心；更有其特殊原因，要在繼續肆其欺騙於佔領區域而已。攷彼欺騙之主要論據凡二；一曰中國不復能抗戰，一曰日本必實行撤兵；由前之說，使淪陷區域之中國人民絕望於國民政府，使國民政府被誣而成怨府；由後之說，欲以「空頭支票」繳中國抗戰之械，欲在若干軍事據點僅駐小量軍隊而仍得絕對控制絕無國防之中國；由此騙術，替代戰不勝，替代戰勝，替代不戰！今者，中國大勝於湘贛矣，所謂「中國不復能抗戰」之說，不攻自破；日本若不諱敗，將無以肆其欺，欺不得不諱。夫千眞萬確之敗仗，猶所不敢不諱，謂敢憣然改圖乎，敢毅然撤兵乎？改圖撤兵，是日本之上策，亦把握直綫之推移者也；而日本方爲下策而將精神物力時間作不必要之損耗</p>

<p>七分鐘、港聯隊猛攻南華、花利亞狡兎三窟、在要地穿揷、乘勇森傳來之球、頂交中路、荷息與澄滔雙雙衝刺、小侯起足敏捷、一射中的、（一比〇）十六分鐘、南華失守後、英祺始上陣湊足人數、士氣奮發、斗文接中綫接濟、冷然斜射、其勢頗勁、但被鄧勤接得、三十分鐘、花利亞又盤馬觀弓、避重就輕、斜交佐芝、神童佐芝開弓遠射、中柱彈出、靈聖及時跑至一脚勾銷、惠堂接球、乘虛猛進、單刀斬門、鄧勤飛身撲救、得免於難、三十五分鐘、兆榮在港聯後防發難、、及機輕交惠堂、惠堂反身掃射、球兒如矢一般、從楣下斜入網窩、一比一成平手、</p>

<h3>東塞萊　勝西福斯　三比一</h3>

<h3>周達雲蔡演雄　在港表演</h3>
<p>（香港通訊）蔡演雄周達雲自滬來、昨特邀請在港同志草草成立上海籃球隊、電影皇帝金燄與焉、時間短促、勢無改期之理、原擬邀的本港冠軍南華隊、臨時無法的得、後經中靑會體育幹事郭木開撮合、拉請中靑舊人化身之星島、出與周旋、事旣決定、復又找得馮念華、徐亨中靑會遂發出球戰佈吿、</p>
<p>比賽</p>
<p>八時開始、雙方球藝、不若理想的精彩、滬聯隊究因臨時組合、又遇着這樣狹小的塲子、聯絡上未臻美境、但個人技術頗佳、蔡演雄周達雲尤爲球迷激賞、金燄打來不算壞、演雄刦奪手段、與手運球花巧、在在使人呌好、達雲邊綫投籃、博得好評、星島隊的打法總不脫舊時作風、塲于小、接觸緊、戰來拖泥帶水、犯規纍纍、黎國鐸陳仕濱四次犯天條、被黜下野、實爲白圭之玷</p>
<p>滬聯</p>
<p>隊一路領前、上半時以二十比十五佔先、易防後、再接再厲、以四十比廿五結束全塲、滬聯諸將罰球每感大意、多不中的、吃虧不少、不然可做成更大的比數、星島隊以上半時六比九時分數最爲接近、但在下半時十八比卅三時相差遠矣、蔡演雄周達雲、兩子今日離此遠去、從此天南地北、滬聯隊又不知何日再上疆塲、兩隊戰績表列下、</p>

<h3>金融　情勢日非　現金又吿慘跌　最低到三九三零元　頗有易跌難漲局面</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、跌勢未戢、蓋以國内外消息均屬不利多方、致扒風杏烈反之斬多者不在少數、而塲中散户交易大都抱薄利即結宗旨、藏儲者極爲稀少、目其趨勢每逢進出稍鉅時買進不易抬高、賣出則易於下瀉、按昨情勢晨開平疲爲三千九百九十五元、未幾因證券帮購入、而同時外滙微軟、金號亦（接踪撈進、顯然回出四季吉元大關、一度昂達四千〇二十元高峯、旋因錢兌業吐出、回至四千元關口、雖香港帮會扒進二百餘兩之夥、卒因外匯轉鬆、供求不平、高價難以久立、延至午刻已祗三千九百五十五元矣、午後金號多頭復出、且外匯繼續帶硬、遂造三千九百三十元最近新低價、倐因港帮又略進小數、情勢轉穩、以三千九百四十元收盤、結果又續跌六十元、全天交易尙暢、的一千三四百兩、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍均平定、</p>
<p>烚赤再跌六十元</p>
<p>自農每條（十兩）初開局勢尙形和平、開市較前收做低五元、某金號售予證券帮三十兩、爲三千九百九十五元、開後證券帮買胃仍强、頻來拉提、不久即步高十五元、證劵帮進錢兌業十兩價爲四千〇十元、此後外匯略帶軟化、某金號亦跟踪牧買、致再步高十元、某金號進某錢兌業二十兩、爲四千〇二十元、旋以外匯忽然轉硬、且某錢兌業趁高猛塞、不支下降、未幾即回落二十元、時某銀樓代港帮收進、同業與錢兌業及金號等共二百六十兩、價均爲四千元、後散戶稍來跟進、一度回高至四千〇〇四元、此後終因賣風又起、銀樓帮與現金號頻來塞賣、且某證券帮亦來吐售、加之港帮觀望不前、復吿下降、竟退落三十八元、銀樓帮售予錢兌業二十兩、價爲三千九百六十六元、其時另一證券帮復來吸納、會回高十四兀、證劵帮進錢兌業十兩、價爲三千九百八十元、午刻某錢兌業代多方斬結、兼現金號賣意仍濃、遂再撳小二十五元、現金號售予銀樓帮二十兩、爲三千九百五十五元、繼之錢兌業互做三十兩、爲三千九百五十六元作午收價、午後初開尙平、首由金號吐予錢兌業二十兩、價爲三千九百五十五元、時金號賣意仍濃、且外匯續稍硬化、致遂步瀉二十五元、錢兌業賣予現金號二十兩、爲三千九百三十元、此後某金號代客趁低收買、一度會回上至三千九百五十五元、入後因散戶復興賣風、又委錢兌業等代售、又趨下疲、竟再退入三千九百四十元關內、其時某銀樓復代港帮稍吸、潛勢轉穩、計某銀樓吸進錢兌業三十兩、爲三千九百三十八元、後又進現令號二十兩、爲三千九百四十元、昨晚收價、結果比隔昨父續跌六十元、聞收後現金號吸進錢兌業數十兩、價爲三千九百三十八元及四十元、全天九十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、收進須减小三十元之譜、現標金照掛牌金低十餘元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金改掛四百元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百〇五元、迨至正午掛小五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸四百元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减小二十元光景、</p>
<h3>外滙期現稍形拔開</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯暗市趨勢、似已步入正軌、穩定極矣、當日經過、毫無緊張色彩、結果軋鬆、以出口商之繼續拋賣、而進者不力故也、晨開因聞美英滙兌略縮、英逐鬆〇三一二五、美則並無差異、嗣以某行頗有納胃、一度微緊、旋因香港來電塞出、且有利與某行均屬出多進少、加以滙豐忽有賣意、雖華商行等曾來吸進、無如頭寸仍感寬裕、致情况又略吿鬆、結果以四便士六八七五及七元八七五當日最鬆價收盤、（合英美滙兌四元〇三分二厘、）較隔昨英美均鬆〇六二五、至期貨之潛勢、因華商納胃已開、咸來扒結、惟外行供意較淡、致爲狀已稍形拔開、照晚收現貨與十月距離、英計〇三一二五、美爲〇六二五、而十一月較現貨相差、英計〇九三七五、美爲一八七五、全天交易平淡、</p>
<p>華商扒結遠期</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期縮三七五、遠期跌六二五、紐約銀價長一二五、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美·滬·法等各匯悉平、美對英降一二五、對滬大一角五分、對法少一二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士六五六二五、美匯七元八一二五、校之前牧、英鬆〇三一二五、美則未更動、此乃滙兌略縮之故、開後華商雖稍有吐售、但某行吃胃甚佳、市勢反稍帶收、計某行吸納華商現貨英金叫便士六五六二五、後銀行賣價曾討英金四便士六四〇六二五、美滙七元七八一二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉小一分半、此後香港前來電塞、兼有利與某行均供過於求、聞滙豐其時亦有塞出、雖華商反來扒吸、但，情况　庭面　、　　　　有利吐予　商及外行華北等現貨英金四便士六五六二五與六八七五、繼而大通某行塞予華商外行現貨美櫃七元八一二五及八四三七五、後某行叉售予華商少數十月份美匯七元七五及十一月份美匯七元六二五、午刻某行再吐予某華行現貨美滙七元八七五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四便士六七一八七五、美滙七元八四三七五、比晨開英續鬆〇一五六二五、美亦硬〇三一二五、</p>
<p>現貨仍見步鬆</p>
<p>後市狀况愈形呆帶、交易極少、聞出口商稍來塞予外行現貨英金叫便十六八七五、繼而出口商與美行大通某行售予華商及外行現貨美滙七元八七五、是以形勢繼續略硬、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四便士六八七五、美滙七元八七五、十月份英金四便士六五六二五、美滙七元八一二五七一月份英金四便士五九三七五　匯七元六八七五、結果比隔　現貨英鬆〇六二五、美亦硬〇六二五、期貨英均長〇三一二五，美則均無榮辱、</p>
<p>香港美滙平定</p>
<p>香港十二日電、今日滙市晨開平穩、美滙日滙均無榮辱、英滙現平遠鬆、現貨仍開一先令三便士、遠期鬆〇三一二五、亦爲一先令三便士、申滙降五兀、爲三百十六元、十一時三十分平穩無變動、下午二時三十分亦穩、美滙遠期亦已開出、爲二十五元一二五、</p>
<p>天津滙市續長</p>
<p>天津十二日電、今日滙市晨開平平、英美滙現貨各鬆一二五、英滙爲三便士九三七五、美滙爲六元六八七五、申滙不動、仍爲一百十五元、「聯鈔」暗盤微昂半元、爲八十七元半、</p>
<h3>外幣跌無回顧</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况益感小支、外匯旣步鬆未已、金價又破入四千元大關、故業內外人心一時愈　振奮、錢兌業於門市更不願以高價收受、以免虧耗、致藏有外幣者大有惴惴不安之狀、昨市結果、以英金鎊跌一元五角爲最巨、次推美鎊之跌一元、英金票降八角、美金票初做十三元零八分、嗣後退入十三元關、卒爲十二元九角二分、結果續跌一角三分、香港票低一分、法郎票落五釐、新加坡票降三角、日金票始漲而後回、初做一元三角五分半、卒爲一元三角四分七釐、結果軋跌三釐、惟朝鮮票趨勢頗佳、卒爲一元一角五分五釐、結果尙漲五釐、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債回挫　外債行市一致銳降　英法跌十鎊為最巨</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨市頓起回風、劇跌一二元之鉅、因政府對於寇爾調停中日戰事之說、已加否認、且倫敦之中國外債、忽又大跌五鎊至十鎊、多方遽爾出籠、初做時吃戶猶多、入後進者頓稀、跌勢亦猛、加以舊空頭抵補幾盡、新空頭獲利無多、補者寥寥、跌落最多者、爲甲種、此後環境若無甚變化、當可盤旋一時、昨日經過、上午賣氣極盛、行將抽籤之丁種、無人過問、餘則初做微疲、繼因永康同康兀康大慶以及一般散戶紛紛求售、市上雖有天生松茂等號吃進、但已供過於求、市價乃瀉落甚驟、午後形勢稍定、但毫無回蘇之象、永康仍有賣出、同康稍有抵補、一日市價結果跌落一元二角半至二元〇五分、成交總數、共計的一百萬之譜、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋兄弟烟草公司股三十股、價爲八元二角牛、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報吿云、昨日股市、下午因新交易開做、購者來勢洶湧、經紀人完成大批定單、誠感相當費力、下午短短一小時內、幾無絲毫餘暇、致各經紀人、咸有勞瘁痰乏之感、會德豐股、國際信託公司股、上海銀公司股曁揚子銀公司股、俱有新高價發現、即被忽視已久之各種橡皮股在昨日漲度交易中、亦得佔一席地、至市况能否繼續維持目下步趨、為難以想像　　、雖現有交易　　　　　金作後盾、但其間亦不乏投機買進、故對反動一　、亦　加注意、</p>
<p>倫敦十一日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、續開開平及朝鮮兩種煤礦、行情開平煤礦股爲十二先令六便士、比前跌三先令九便士、朝鮮煤礦股爲三先令九便士、比前跌三便士、銀行股稍見上升、麥加利股升五先令、爲六鎊十二先令六便士、匯豐銀行英倫註册股升一鎊、爲七十三鎊、又香港註冊股升二鎊、爲七十五鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股跌一便士、爲十五先令七便士、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦十一日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、全部開出、行情一致下降、上檔之英法（英發）跌十鎊、價爲三十鎊、英德續（英發）及中法美金各跌八鎊、前者為四一鎊、後者為三十鎊、善後（英發）跌七鎊，價爲二十五鎊、克利斯浦跌三鎊、價爲十八鎊、費克斯飛機跌二鎊半、價爲六鎊、下檔鐵路債券、隴海及廣九各跌三鎊、前者價爲八鎊、後者價爲九鎊、京滬跌一鎊、價爲十一鎊、其餘各跌一鎊計道淸價爲十鎊、北寗價爲四十三鎊、湖廣（德發及非德發）各爲十一鎊、津浦（原續發及英德發）各爲九鎊、</p>
<h3>紗花　二十支下身紗　囤購復起</h3>
<p>連朝下降之紗市、昨則突然回升、此種回風、亦在意料之中殊不爲奇也、不過實需形勢雖見活絡、然各帮辦量尙微弱、故人心未能十分提高、港帮對於組紗吸收近百包、細紗需要依然停滯未購、但有一部份實力富裕之戶因其價格廉宜在六百五十元之下身二十支紗、認爲布廠方成本之中、無大利可圖、囤購之意復生、於是買者稍衆，市態又復回蘇、收盤以後二十支雙馬現出價做至七百二十五元，</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣平庸、且係一片散漫無勁之象、開價續跌七元、雙馬現貨價爲七百〇二元、棧單價爲六百八十六元、至於港帮對於粗紗稍有需要、市象平穩、少頃聞消息良好、買風尤熾、徐徐上升、但某豐近來天天賣出、查此戶素來有大批多額、目下不知何故放手矣、二十支雙馬最高價曾做到七百二十五元、棧單爲七〇五元、比開盤現貨價漲二十三元、查半日成交一千二百六十包、行情二十支雙馬漲十三元、雙地球漲十一元、天女漲二十二元、今日出口棉紗有五十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額列左、</p>
<h3>廠辦開展　通花甫到卽罄</h3>
<p>本棉交易大爲起色、日廠紛紛採辦、內外日華東華等廠進白包花通州火機花約三千包、華廠新裕進火機花二千包、同業鑒於廠商胃口開展、搜羅之意尤爲豐厚、白包花生意頓見興奮、市價在上午同業中一致看疲、因近來到頭擁擠、詎料廠方乘機活動、頽唐之勢、被其挽回、蘇北來漁、到通花五千五百二十一包、被同業及中外各廠掃數吃光、未有餘剩、茲據市塲情形觀測、外廠採辦發動、將後尙有大枇購辦之舉、所以市價與上日相彷、碼頭上草有三百十五包運香港、茲將現棉售盤情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來因外匯猛鬆、折合棉價殊為低廉、廠方靜觀已有多日、昨日靑島帮乘機略有購辦、惟為數甚微、連日到貨甚擠、已供過於求、因之其價慘落、外棉因而被累、價格下跌甚巨也、</p>
<p>外棉市慣、紐約棉市、晨初頗爲堅定、利物浦及孟買來電良好、市況活躍、同業在市購買亦衆多、南方帮套賣之風亦靜寂、現貨交易轉旺、市况更爲堅挺、收盤價格較上白漲五六磅昔、印度棉市連同預測猛漲五羅比餘、埃及漲十餘磅音、利物浦漲九便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　新粳到貨獨多</h3>
<p>售盤跌勢亦巨　客秈旺鉗回好</p>
<p>昨日各幫來源河下共到南港二三號、車輪包子五六千包、銷塲因客尖價搭已到低盤、本鄉作客大都進辦、客尖已提高三五角、餘如破粳及窰種·百哥·蘆羊尖·以供求相仿、無榮辱、新粳到貨頗旺、去路平常、續落半元至一元、計做開常錫破三十二三元、中三十元、新粳二十八丸元、蘇同崑破三十元、新粳二十六七元、靑角窰種二十九元、楓嘉百哥二十七八元、羊尖二十三元、次至二十一元、蘆尖二十三元半、次爲二十二元、江北尖十八兀一二角、次爲十七元七角、蕪湖特尖十九元、次爲十七元半、砶尖十七元、變元陳三十一二元、新二十六七元、亦貶元譜、統市成交數六千餘包、</p>
<p>另訊客秈仍以價盤低廉而動銷、目內地鄉莊各帮及本市店舖廠作飯館等亦趁低收買、交易愈形活潑、零星併計成交六千四五百包之夥、惟存底雖多、運到亦見蟬聯、然以目下滬價祇十七八元、砶米十六元許、糙米十五元左右、此價已與產地成本不劃、行販新交易多已去電停頓、大戶與日商亦不肯再度賤脫、故在本客暢辦之後、行情頓時回砌二三叫角、乃與粳米銷滯步跌、適爲背馳云、</p>
<h3>粉銷活動</h3>
<p>粉市續見昂挺、二號粉廠盤、雖未加價、而回籠貨則已逐漸向榮、良以連日南北兩帮客銷、趁小問津、砲車粉尤爲靑島帮所垂靑、已與廠盤相埒，其他各牌回籠貨、均以市上籌碼已少、行囤不冉急脫、統市成交續有四萬餘包、廠盤仍爲七元、車牌與紅藍福新牌價爲六元九角半至九角、兵船牌六元七角半至八角、聞日廠鳳凰牌粉、亦同時提高、十月份價須六元五角半至六角、</p>
<p>麥市續緊、連日各地到貨不旺、而產價迄無鬆動、更兼粉市堅挺、售手均擬喊高、惟廠囤去化、一時尙彆暢達、繞市由福阜兩廠辦去蘇州·常熟·常州·揚州·南京·等垀二千包、價爲九元八角至六角、</p>
<h3>油市　生豆油大漲小回</h3>
<p>豆油因來源不湧、檯面上流動籌碼應拙、（桶裝油約有千　、　裝油二千餘件）、有力囤戶、堅守勿出、一般視神戶油之最高峯、預測須達七十元、良以昨市實銷不動、市氣軟化、但行情比上日祗挫二角、大勢依然榮多辱少、昨統市計開神戶油三十桶、價爲六十元八角、膠州油五十件、價爲四十七元五角及烟台聽裝油二百聽、價爲六十三元、花生油亦稍削二角、港帮不動、祇本街辦去膠州油二百件、價爲五十七元八角、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆子芝蔴運華南</h3>

<h3>湘北大捷聲中　華軍已進薄滬郊　日坦克車馳往靑浦應戰　虹橋附近華正規軍活躍　浦東游擊隊準備反攻</h3>
<p>湘北中日兩軍、經旬日來激戰後、日軍死傷逾萬、不得不宣稱放棄進佔長沙之企圖、東南一帶游擊區內、聞此捷音、當此秋高氣爽、士飽馬騰、淬勵部衆、再建戰績、因此京滬杭間日軍於疲乏之餘、益感窮於應付、而華方游擊部隊則精神抖擻、與秋菊傲骨、同其堅貞、最近華方正規軍隊紛紛開入游擊區域、億萬民衆、簞食以迎、其情緒至為熱烈、因此滬郊一帶、華軍近來更形活躍、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>華正規軍　開抵滬郊</p>
<p>前日淸晨浦地帶以東、槍聲甚密、至上午九時左右、日方坦克車、絡繹經過虹橋飛機塲西開、但日方坦克車開赴靑浦後、虹橋路南、槍聲又起、據來滬鄕人談、係華方正規軍業已開抵該區、有所行動、迨午後、日坦克車及滿裝步兵之卡車、又忽遽東駛、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（十二日）晨靑浦方面傳來沉重槍聲後、上午九時許即有日方坦克車經過虹橋飛機塲西行、逾兩小時後始駛返、此等坦克車曾否開火、未能確悉、惟各車西　後、虹橋村附近即發生槍聲、其地在虹橋路南、即坦克車駛過地之後數哩處、聞虹橋村附近之槍聲、係華方正規軍所發者、午刻甫過、又聞靑浦區傳來槍聲、日方坦克車與載步兵之卡車乃馳返靑浦公路、</p>
<p>浦東游擊　隊將反攻</p>
<p>水年夏間、日軍對浦東奉南川三縣游擊隊爲「掃蕩」計劃、曾一度退集於沿海各區、自奉賢起至南匯泥城、而依欽公塘達到川沙爲公塘完全海邊區域、雙方隔塘而爲天然之鴻溝、日軍亦無力進攻、相持至今、游擊隊加强配備後、已取反攻姿態、據鄕民來謂、游擊隊於最近如總攻擊之一般、均被越過此界綫、且有偽「自衛團」之大部反正影響、目下之游擊隊在奉賢者已抵沿甫　巷泰日橋等地、南匯者已佔橫沔、且魯家匯克復、已近周浦、上川路之北半段至高家行、皆爲游擊隊控制、</p>
<p>定海城內　情勢嚴重</p>
<p>據最近自定海來滬旅客某君談、定海東城門外自發生劇烈戰事後、新橋頭同壽泰酒坊（係定海『自治委員會會長』陳二梅所開設）門前、於上月二十九日深夜十一時許、突有炸彈爆發、轟然巨聲、震動遐邇、城內日軍聞訊後、即緊閉城門、嚴密防備、直至翌晨始派隊前往勘察、見該炸彈爆發處面積頗大、四週道路亦多遭炸燬、旁並置有「靑年鐵血除奸團」之彩色傳單多份、內容略謂係來警吿參加某組織者（望即回頭自新云云、該地「自治委員會長」陳三梅、即於事後印發傳單、說明係無奈參加、請求寬恕、「副會長」沈宋能則潛逃離城、其他亦多紛紛脫離他去、情勢極爲恐怖、連日日兵因恐遭游擊隊進獎、特加築砲壘、對進出居民、嚴加檢查稍有可疑、即被拘押、情勢嚴重之極、</p>
<h3>文化界募寒衣捐　解繳辦法</h3>

<h3>蘇州河北甲區　尙無異狀</h3>
<p>蘇州河北甲區內、日方强迫注射工作雖已截止、惟進出該區域內尙無限制、同時該區域居民之戶口檢查、日方亦未實現、惟區內各段時有日軍巡邏、進出北江西路鐵絲綱缺口、則檢查通行證已較前為嚴、又北江西路底靶子路口、於日軍未接防該處前、英軍本在該處設有崗位、自日軍接防後、英軍之崗位、即行撤去、而日軍亦未在該處設置崗位、居住閘北而未備有通行證之拾荒者、常將拾得之枯枝焦木、由該處所攔之鐵絲網下、偷運至租界內出售、致該處鐵絲網常有損壞、昨日下午四時、一便衣日軍、曾持鞭驅打拾荒者、而一般不知情由之拾荒者、仍擬將枯枝焦木企圖仍在該處偷運、莫不遭受日軍之鞭打、抱頭竄去、北江西路文監師路口缺口處之日軍崗亭上、新貼有禁止車輛通過之字句、惟脚踏車不在其例、北江西路海寗路口之缺口處、則一任車輛出入、</p>
<h3>陳述對中立法見解　美商會電華府　希望於通過前加新條款　美船繼續航行遠東口岸</h3>
<p>大陸報云、本市美商會、唯恐美參議員畢德門之中立法修正案若經通過、則就遠東若干口岸之美國航運而言、將自招損失、爰於昨日（十一日）致電華盛頓美國務院、陳述美商會對此事之見解、據昨夜所得消息、美商會電中竭力指出畢德門議案若照目前方式通過、則對於中國甚至遠東其他口岸之</p>
<p>美國商業</p>
<p>利益、終有損害匪淺之後果、美商會並表示本市美商人之見解、主張畢德門議案有所更變、俾於遠東諸口岸雖屬交戰國者、但長此不在確實戰區內、美國船隻、即可繼續航行此等口岸、關於美商會所取此舉、昨夜未獲其他消息、惟聞發致美國務院之電文、已經本市美商全體贊成、按畢德門議案已交美參院討論其</p>
<p>原定計劃</p>
<p>爲限制美船駛往戰區、依據該案條款、美總統有權指出限制美國航運之交戰區、一般人雖感美總統不擬指太平洋為交戰區、惟上海美商意見、以為不應存僥倖之心、而應於該案通過之前、加入新條款、若太平洋各區被指為交戰區、則上海與天津、亦將在限制美國航運的城市之列、此固可以想見者、故美商會乃於昨日電達國務院、陳述一切</p>
<h3>日報竟指上海　設有共產機關　厚誣租界當局為所朦蔽　謂蘇聯組織俄僑事務局　兩租界當局均否認有此組織</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日文上海每日新聞「發現」上海有蘇聯之「共產機關」、上海兩租界之警務處、均爲該機關之神秘疑雲所瞞、上海每日新聞、昨日對此種並不存在之威脅、大事渲染、而作第二次之抨擊、</p>
<p>赤色陰謀　籠罩白俄</p>
<p>據該報載稱、上海白俄移民、現因猶太移民增多而遇新威脅、莫斯科仍佯設促進白我福利之幾關、實則莫斯科陰謀之赤色暗影、已籠罩於上海之五萬白俄矣、此種威脅、託名「俄僑事務局」、其名稱與「滿洲國」及華北所設照料白俄移民事務之機關名稱相同、實則該「俄僑事務局」者、乃「蘇聯政府之前哨」也、</p>
<p>凖備進行　共產運動</p>
<p>駐滬蘇聯總領署人員十一人、於上月下旬返莫斯利後該局即吿成立、而計畫設立該局者、即返莫斯科之十一人也、該局旨在博取反共白俄之同情、並淮行「其他大規模之共產運動」、如政治上與經濟上之諜報工作等是」云、</p>
<p>企圖取締　白俄團體</p>
<p>上海每日新聞並未披露此「赤色威脅」之總部所在地、惟續稱、俄僑事務局所取第ｇ　步驟、乃謀取締反對蘇聯之白俄栘民聯合會與烏克蘭移民委員會、已請公共租界工部局與法租界公董局封閉該兩團體、但工部局與公董局均尙未採取行動云、記者昨向工部局與公董局叩詢、悉兩局均不知有此團體存在、兩局切實否認任何團體或個人會商諸兩局以謀取締上述兩白俄移民團體、並據兩局指稱、上海每日新聞所載白俄移民五萬人一數、實乃過甚其詞、因白俄移民僅的其數之半、</p>
<h3>滬西偽警搜查　毫無所獲</h3>
<p>越界築路區域、日偽行動、變幻莫測、繼偽警之後、又有所謂「特務隊及「自衛團」之出殃、局勢更趨複雜、居民咸惶惑不安、自國慶日發現標語傳單後、偽警運日大施搜查、氨無所獲、昨日在勞勃生路·曹家渡·極司非而路·白利南路·及兆豐花園一帶、沿路電桿木上、突貼有其他標語、</p>

<p>限制各輪　變更國籍</p>
<p>大光社記者昨向航業界探悉、日方扣留大批葡輪及少數德意商船、其目的顯在覬覦產權、意圖收買、最近一部份葡商以輪隻被扣日久、延未解決、損失不貲、故擬將所屬輪隻售與第三國航商、詎日領署對此竟表示反對、突通知葡領署謂、被扣各葡輪不准變更產權及國籍、但如出售與日商或華商、則並不反對云云、觀此日方之意圖、已屬昭然若揭云、</p>

<h3>花轎  柴燕</h3>
<p>我的妹妹新近出嫁，是參加集團結婚的。集團結婚是在近年來很時髦，不過更真實的原因却爲省錢；大部份參加集團結的，大概也是『同病相憐』吧？報紙上登著『國難期間，一切從簡』，而實際上收『俾眾過知』之效的廣告，在什麼大酒樓用三十元以上一席酒菜大宴親友的，參加集團結婚的不是無份的吧？</p>
<p>不過這樣一來，新嫁娘坐花轎的權利却是被剝奪了。照我們鄉下（甯波）的俗例，花轎這東西原是神聖不過的，男家在吉期的前一夜『享先』（時間總在五更）的時候，轎前便專誠設上一席，以祀轎神。花轎更不准婦女用手去觸碰牠（據說女人的手是不潔的，用香肥皂洗也洗不掉）以免惱怒了轎神；轎槓之類，如果不幸有婦女跨過，那更非用糖湯惟誠惟恐地洗過不可；轎神爲什麼這樣不喜歡婦女，而花轎的本身却又專是供給女人乘坐的，這其間的矛盾我可不知道了。而糖湯能夠驅除不祥，我更莫明所以，想來，大概轎神是喜歡喫糖的吧？</p>
<p>因爲花轎是這樣神聖不可侵犯，所以新娘出嫁，也以乘坐花轎爲榮辱所擊。村婦吵架，揀對方弱點進攻的本領是和阿Q先生一個師父那裏學來的，所以『太婆是紅紅花轎抬來的，花轎進，棺材出，不比人家綠呢小轎一頂，小船一只……』就也成爲制敵於死命的法寶。對方一聽到『花轎』二字，雖不啞口無言，却也肅然起敬，因之欲謀對抗，不是同樣的舉出花轎，以呎身份，便是另起爐灶，揀別的弱點進攻。</p>
<p>花轎之爲用是大矣哉，要購到實際上的享受，却並不愉快，光綫是暗的，四周圍得密不通風，空氣也並不暢通，爲了討結利，並且還得不論冬夏，加上一只生了火的腳爐，新嫁娘的打扮，風冠霞帔之外，外面還得加上一件『太婆衣』，臉上也蒙上一塊紅布做的『蓋頭蓬』，那裝飾就煩乎目蓮戲裏的『女吊』，所以要這樣一副怪打扮，我知道得太少；大概總還是和轎神有關。打扮得醜怪一點，並且把臉蒙起來，以免嫉妒的意思。新式結婚中來賓把黃豆撒到新人的身上（現在是改用紅紅綠綠的紙屑了），據說本意便是在驅散妒嫉新夫婦的鬼怪，想不到中外的鬼怪，在這方面倒是古今同流的</p>
<p>坐花轎雖是一件並不好受的事情，我鄉的新嫁娘却是堅持甘願嘗嘗這苦刑的，花轎到堂前，因了不夠漂亮或新鮮的，甚至有賴著不肯上轎的，固然解決的辦法，往往是父兄親口答應多賠嫁些什麼。坐上以後，身體衰弱的，因了在這活動黑房裏受了熏蒸和顛簸，嘔吐是常有的，有的甚至會暈過去，於是猜測紛紜，有的說是不潔，沖犯了轎神；有的說是福薄，沒福消受；再壞一點的就懷疑新嫁娘在娘家有什麼不貞行爲，好似轎神就是一個專驗處女膜的專任醫師似的。不過難關雖是重重，他們卻也願受這個試驗，唯一的理由是這是一身一世祇此一遭的『享受』，她們說，就是發了幾百萬的財，汽車什麼是都可以坐的，花轎就沒法再坐。</p>
<p>這理由也許是對的，可是因了戰亂，轎神的威權也衰落了，我的妹妹出嫁沒有坐花轎，便是一個例證。</p>
<p>不過沒有戰爭的推移，轎神的威權大概不會衰落得那樣快吧？至少我的妹妹她是要坐花轎的，對方男家爲了表示面子起見，也就非得讓他們的新媳婦『花轎進門』不可。</p>
<p>反帝戰爭實際上就包括了反封建在內的，抗戰即是建國，我們真該感謝促使舊中國崩潰，新中國誕生的『武士』。</p>
<p>雨過天青　包天笑</p>
<h3>第十六回　謀興醫學造士成庠　思擴村治託兒有所</h3>
<p>現在可是不同了，雖然是一個村子，好比是一個放大的家，縮小的國。每年也有多少收入，多少支出，也有預算，也有決算。譬如一國，有國有的財產，有國營的事業。他們一個村子，也是如此。他們有村有的材產，也有村營的事業。你們別小覷這個自由村咧，他們此刻並不像從前那們，動輒什麼捐，什麼捐。也沒有什麼附加稅，加之不已，教人見了頭痛。那末他們的村中收入，從那裏來呢？他們不是也要辦許多事業嗎？中央政府，省政府，並不能資助地方上的款項，這是要你自己去籌備的。他們的收入，第一就是靠地租。因爲自從這次戰爭以後，全國的土地，起了一個大變化。所有土地，不得私有，就像自由村的土地，便歸自由村所公有。倘然村民要用那土地時，便得向村中去租，每年須納若干租金。這租金固然不一，繁榮地方的租金，不能與荒僻地方的租金一致。租金是跟著地方的情形而估定的，雖然土地既不能賣買，土地似乎沒有了價格，可是租金的多少，就等於土地的價格。不過土地價值，漲落無定，租價也就隨之而升降。因此公家便設立了一個土地估價委員會，無論何處的土地，每年都要估價一次。這估價不是估賣買的價，却是估租借的價。就像自由村，以前的租地，每年每畝地，出若干租金的，現在已經漲了不少，不止出若干租金了。這是當然的道理，全中國的土地，只在年年漲價，決不會有落價的。尤是像江浙的鄉村，尤其是像江浙鄉村中的自由村。因爲現在各處大都市中，實在人太多了，　思疏散開來。譬如像上海那種地方，人口之多，擁擠不堪，不免引起許多危險性來。所以極力的要疏散開來，而疏散的路綫，自然總是向相近的地方，江浙兩省，已經有了許多都市，於是便向各處的鄉村走了。但鄉村也各各不同，雖然戰後的鄉村，都在逐漸發達，可是有的組織嚴密，有的却經營未必完善，不可一概而論，不過像自由村那樣，以朱老先生的數年內苦心孤詣，就是江浙之間的許多鄉村以內，也可以算得是一個現代的模範新村了。　一九〇</p>
<h3>火輪船（機械詩話）  如晦</h3>
<p>卭江詞客「上海竹枝詞」五十道之一云：</p>
<p>吳淞口子犬牙排　防海當年築跑台</p>
<p>一自通商都撤去　隨波輕送火輪來</p>
<p>自海禁開後，輪船隨之而來，於是又引起詩人的注意，以極驚奇的眼光目之，如對煤氣燈，對電綫，對電報一樣。據王弢，「瀛墧雜志」所記，當時此類船隻，每小時可行六七十裏，然在詩人看來，已竟如有縮地之術。二十三間屋舊主人詠之云：</p>
<p>中江好，巧絕火輪船。轉磨制同燈走馬，登程疾似箭離弦，萬裏往來便。</p>
<p>喻之爲「燈走馬」，「箭離弦」，其驚奇可知。由於這驚奇，詩人們又不期然的想到兩性關係方面去。故啘香留夢室主人「滬北小竹枝詞」四道之一云：</p>
<p>歸期在春初　涼秋猶未至</p>
<p>朝朝望火船　欲寄相思字</p>
<p>稱之爲「火船」，殊不當，顧當時固尚無「輪船」之一名詞存在也。其校科學的加以說的，爲王之春「談瀛錄」卷一所載之「輪船出洋」詩云：</p>
<p>電擊雷轟撼不休　艨　直趁水東流</p>
<p>銀濤駛破風嘶馬　鐵甲欲飛星犯牛</p>
<p>大氣幹旋輪軸轉　狐煙搖曳海天秋</p>
<p>樓船本是吾家物　再出石頭試一遊</p>
<p>中間兩聯，實不愧傑作。此外，在王弢紀「火船」文中，可曾提到「戰艦」，但當時詩人以「戰艦」入詩者却極少，也許是因爲海戰在彼時倘不曾有過，而「火船」則與當時人生活較爲接近。余所見者，僅有「軍艦歌」一章，見辛漢所著「中學唱歌集」中，錄之於此。歌云··</p>
<p>中央一令山搖動，海部軍權重。大將旌旗陣雲，坐艦當前湧。砲位光寒左右舷，電鳴天鴻洞。探險明燈入夜紅，四國驚威猛。南溟北渤聯聲勢，睦瞬有道外交權。樹威保國男兒志，太平洋，正多事，猛犯波濤坐待時，武臣不惜死！（一）</p>
<p>可惜當日全師覆，此辱何時雪？海軍力弱難爲國，他族欺淩急。美洲新　巴拿馬，時勢要人切．試思鷮喬蚌有爭恃，那堪坐失漁翁利？老帝國，終黨起，海權恢復國威張，江由增壯氣！（二）</p>
<p>然此亦是在甲午戰敗日本後所作也「太平洋，正多事」，在數十年前，太平洋即充滿危機，却未想及數十年後之今日，其緊張情勢，仍未稍弛　至　全師復未之恥,則洗滌之日已近,因此番戰爭,吾國終將處於勝利之一方也.</p>
<p>自取滅亡之道</p>
<p>上海的物價飛漲，投機者的國積居奇自然是最大的原因，尤其是在歐洲戰事發生以後。可是一般商人的乘機牟利，盲目地抬髙物價，也是一個原因。這種不正常的發展，雖能憑籍著「孤島」的特殊情形而獲利於一時，但實際上歐洲的戰事如何，及一般居民是否能夠擔負如此重荷，最近的事實，已明顯地打破了那些投機者與盲目商人的如意算盤了。</p>
<p>如某公司的廣告，因爲麵粉腐爛，警告客家即日出貨。從這一則廣告中，我們可以明瞭那些投機商人是多麼狠心，在米價飛漲，居民以面粉代食的時候，就大量地把面粉囤積起來，因之，面粉的價格也逐步上漲。但是現在新穀登場，來源暢旺，米價跌到三十左右，釉米秈米　售十八元了，這些囤積洋貨的，也都有虧本的。——這真是給予投機者一個最好的教訓！</p>
<p>至於一般商人，也籍口外匯，來源什麼而大漲其價，其又實那些物品，甚至與外匯，來源一無關係。在這一般購買（也儘量的節衣縮食了），受著剝削之外，其他可省的都節省了，實在是再不能增加擔負了。所以，加價果然是商人的自由，而直接受影響的也是他們自己，—就是一切物品銷路都猛跌。這事實的教訓也使他們知道一切投機取巧都是自取滅亡之道。</p>
<p>在提倡重整商業道德的呼聲中，希望商人們的目光放得遠一點，將本求利，也應該有個限度。即使大家技法煞了良心，不談什麼「商業道德」，可是「銷路猛跌」是自扳磚頭自壓腳的最好鐵證！（天問）</p>

<h3>梅蘭芳的私生活（一）  李婓叔　　美邊雜憶之六　　戲劇頗重「三一律」，賤子寫作，也有個「三一律」。一：與會不至不寫，二：皮箧不空不寫，三：不近女色不寫。與會至，則下筆千言，倚馬可待。皮箧空，則妻孥嗷嗷，待米作炊，使你不忍不寫，換錢易米也。近女色，則週身如釋重負，頭腦格外清新，其功效，殊不減於「紅豆燈邊米囊花」也。　　與會不至，稿費又領到，黃臉婆適小病，職是之故，「美邊雜憶」，幾至鬢齡夭折！勞編者大駕枉過，料係催稿，縱非催稿，我也要說他是催稿。蓋編輯先生在吾輩寒酸作者的心目中，操有取舍的權術，地位的崇高，無殊於從前殿試時的閱卷大臣。雖然是普通的過訪，我却正好借此以自重。說他是前來催稿，無形中便能增高我的文章身價。君不見：「　年追隨先總理」「我的朋友胡適之」，區區兩句話，不知成全了多少革命偉人與文學大家也。　　我的「三一律」到期了。更以編者之寵過，亟寫此以圖報稱。　　題目與腹稿，本已擬成兩篇，一係遊日雜感，適師友們告誡我，寫文章要留神些！不可信口雌黃，更不要稍涉有政治的嫌疑。雖然，，他們視我太高了！我那配談什麽政治的話。不過，生此亂世，尤其在孤島上，寫作還是謹慎些的好！不見朱惺公先生，他竟「不負少年頭」了嗎？恕我是懦夫，還要留着這一雙眼睛同一張嘴，嘴是等着嘗嘗一百元一担的米，畢竟是什麽滋味？眼睛是留着看看這世界舞臺上，大軸子倒底是一齣什麽戲？正如虹霓關上東方氏說的話：「不知誰勝那家強」也？　　有很多的友人，見我的「梅邊雜憶」之後，都盼望我能把梅先生的私生活寫出來。的確，日常與梅先生相處的人，覺得他一切的一切，是很平凡的。但是在許多外人猜想起來，不曉得他的生活，是何等的神秘！外間傳說，他每天要吃四五十元的珍珠粉。更有人說他家中養有十幾個保鑣的。諸如此類，未免太離奇了！所以我就趁此機會，寫這篇「梅蘭芳的私生活」既正社會傳聞之誤，想亦本刊讀者所需要。不過我先得聲明一句，我雖是他的學生而兼私人秘書，我却有我自己的立場，決不敢阿諛所私。這篇文字，一本有聞必錄的宗旨，以求真實。一對活寶貝　勞萊，哈台在新片　　A　Champ　at　Ox-ford　中呆頭呆腦的神氣碩果僅存之老旦人才　李多奎印象  病鳩　　李多奎此次南來，實予喜聆老旦戲者以一大好機會。梨園老旦行，自夔雲甫物化後，繼起人才，僅臥雲居士及李多奎二人，臥雲體弱，隱退已久，故在今日言老旦正宗，實多奎一人而已。此次更新平角中，多一多奎，陣容加強，不啻倍蓰，筆者於此道有嗜痴癖，更新揭幕以後，迭觀其「吊金龜」「遊六殿」「目蓮救母」等，不下四五齣，聲韻猶者，神采依然，一曲歐來，俗塵頓消，而操絃者襯托得法，更收綠葉之助。　　多奎初學鬢生，無　　名，甫操絃有年，深知時人所尚，至是盡以心得授諸李，後李出演，復爲之操琴，牡丹綠葉，相得益彰。多奎既爲雲甫嫡傳弟子，深窺夔派堂奧，唱腔委婉，說白正靜，音韻清亮脆朗，得雲甫纏綿陰柔之長，惟嗓音較前略遜，拔高處迸力求好，似失圓潤，低運委婉有餘，蒼勁古樸不足，雖俱一波三折，綿邈搖曳之美，而乏抑揚頓挫，餘音嫋嫋之味，此乃學夔未到止境，好在每歌一劇，始終不懈，一句一字，　不用盡力氣，淋漓痛快，不嫌其火。余最愛其反調之嗚咽悲楚，令人神往，白口一味輕脆失其重濁，有時過火，忽略其音之正確，吐字口勁矜持過甚，不耐聽，且尖　誤用，每劇皆不能免，與夔雲甫有同病；扮相堂皇有富貴氣，最合命婦身份，作派身段，少婀娜風度，僅於瀟灑大方上着眼，亦不相宜；台步水袖，直類馬富祿反串，太不講求，蓋老旦之手眼身法步，處處應合「老邁龍種」四字，固不僅扮相與唱白已也。昔日夔雲甫演「探寒審」，出入審門，舞袖翩翩，風致足以壓倒青衣身段，當時平人以其有失王夫人身分，遂以花老旦譏之，其實老旦所扮既屬老年女子，應有幾分青衣身段，婀娜之姿，陽剛之美，係老旦身段之的評，過猶不及，要在演者自己體會耳。新片介紹野性姑娘  企華　　“The　Girl　From　Mexieo”　　「野性姑娘」這劇本可以說完全爲了這位久不上銀幕的羅波范麗而編製的，但是羅波范麗的墨西哥姑娘，祗是外表上的潑野，頑皮，而不能更深入地把握着那種好顧嬉鬧的熱帶姑娘的性格，所以，有好幾場戲，她的過份誇張的舉止，最近乎滑稽了。　　李昂埃洛爾的舒服馬特，演得很好，他的動作，表情都適合於糊塗蟲這一型的角色。　　導演手腕並不高明，祗是平鋪直敘介紹一個故事而已，最低限度羅波范麗竊愛唐納伍滋的過程都不夠明顯，以致最後唐納伍滋徹夜不眠，及趕到羅米諾別墅去的高潮，沒有力量。簾外桃花  企華　　“Man　About　Town”　　有人說過，美國電影多「花色蛋糕」。那末，「簾外桃花」自然也是一盤精細的「花色蛋糕」。先看一看它的故事：阿靈頓夫人和寶寶夫人都因爲丈夫忙於理財，忽略了對妻子應盡的義務，於是她們設計佯和一歌劇的管事鮑伯者親人，藉以引起丈夫的妒意。這劇本就在好萊塢「新御夫術」的主題下展開了一幕荒唐滑稽的喜劇。　　全片演出，都是以「巧合」堆砌起來。如鮑伯等在火車中談論阿靈頓夫人時，阿靈頓爵士正坐在他們的對面：阿靈頓和寶寶夫人在窗口中看見鮑伯和對方的妻子親熱而各自暗笑等。於情於理，即是鮑伯和狄安娜（桃樂姍拉摩）的戀愛也是莫名其妙拉來結合的。　　最後穿插的歌舞場面，倒頗見偉大，尤其是攝影的美麗，如每一個黑紗面部的「特寫」，及一場黒裙舞的　圖章法，都很新穎美觀。　　歐陽予倩赴桂　　主持戲劇學院　　據「中藝」來滬團員談，該團支持人歐陽予倩先生現已離港赴桂，應當地長官邀約，擔任桂林省立戲劇音樂學院院長。歐陽此次赴桂，一方面因「中藝」無形解散，一部份團員均離港，其中大部份已來滬；一方面則歐陽對戲劇熱心並勿因「中藝」解體而終止，久擬回內地繼續工作，適逢桂林當局邀約，故即起程，現已抵桂，想數日後桂林戲劇界又有一番新氣象矣。　　　津災會串　津災月餘，遍地難民，急待急濟，滬上各大善士有發起演劇籌賑之訊，地點已定黃金大戲院，日期在宋德珠滿期後，演唱或二日，參加者　黃金全體名角外，章遏雲亦允登台演唱。梨園外紀　徐慕雲三劉之孝義節　　劉趕三之大名，習知劇事者類能道之，彼演「探親家」騎真驢上台，已足表現其不同流俗的奇行。他如在劇詞中往往自編新詞諷刺時政，尤使一般王公大臣見之生畏，蓋清末政治腐敗，達於極點，劉因激於義憤，竟不顧利害，詛咒權要，因此深爲彼等嫉恨，將劉投諸監獄者，不計若干次，晚年被推爲精忠廟廟首，遂不常登台。呆中東甲午之役後，趕三年已八旬以外，某人渠復現身紅氍　上，假其所飾某角之地位，以打諢之語大諷李鴻章喪師割地之可恥，而其旁若無人，不畏強禦之精神，一時使台下聽眾大爲動容。不意合肥之子侄輩適亦在場觀劇，老羞成怒，遂捕之入獄，聞趕三後竟終死於囹圄。彼以如此高年，既不偷生怕死，復不眷戀其廟首之尊榮，而竟現身說法，以與權要相抗衡，說者咸謂趕三實古之義士畸人，特隱於伶者耳。劉喜奎貌極美，惟其人則艷如桃李，冷若冰霜。民國初年彼由津入都，名士如易賓甫，武人若參謀次長陸錦等，無不趨之若鶩，力爲捧場，時有陸之屬員崔承熾者，對劉眷戀尤殷，結果崔劉二人竟成伉儷。事爲陸錦聞悉，大起醋意，立將崔之第二部部長免職。但崔以美人卒爲我得，雖被革職，亦不以爲意。（一一八）</h3>

Furthermore, the civilian clothes of the people in various places were completely looted when the Japanese army retreated.

<h3>Conflict Between US Soldiers and Puppet Police in Peiping</h3>
<p>Tianjin: According to news from here today, regarding the incident on Tuesday in Beiping when US Marine Ammonier had a conflict with the Japanese-controlled road police for transporting US Navy supplies through obstacles and shot the road police, he was arrested by Chinese police controlled by the Japanese and escorted to the US Marine Corps headquarters last night by the Japanese. It is reported that the road police's knee was injured by the US soldier. The US Marine Corps stationed in Tianjin has organized a court to investigate the case.

<h3>Wang Kemin Appointed President of the Xinminhui</h3>
<p>Beiping: Wang Kemin, the leader of the "Provisional Government of Beiping," has been appointed president of the Xinminhui, the only political party in North China. It is widely believed that the appointment is intended to prevent Wang Jingwei from expanding his "belief" in the Kuomintang to North China. Political parties in North China oppose the establishment of Jingwei's "new central government." The Xinminhui's new plan will increase the conflict between the two parties. The Japanese official newspaper Xinminbao stated that the Xinminhui and the "Provisional Government of Beiping" jointly ordered the appointment of Wang Kemin as the head of both, which will consolidate the party's power. "The Xinminhui has now become an important political organization and will be a strong opponent of the "New Kuomintang" organized by Wang Jingwei." (Associated Press dispatch of the 12th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Inferior Strategy</h3>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, it is now necessary to review the overall situation. The issue is not merely the battles between the two armies in Hunan and Jiangxi, and the military value of their advances and retreats.</p>
<p>Concerning the overall situation, two points must be clarified first: If China were to abandon resistance against Japan today, after twenty-eight months, Japan would indeed have penetrated deeply, and China would be defeated. However, if China continues its resistance, it is in the early stages of turning defeat into victory, moving closer to final victory. Therefore, President Chiang's recent proclamation to the military and civilians clearly demonstrates confidence in achieving victory while avoiding complacency, and encourages them to endure hardship and sacrifice, with benevolence overflowing in his words. This is what pleases the Chinese military and civilians. This is one aspect. As for Japan's aggression against China, after twenty-eight months of experience and lessons, it has indeed abandoned its extravagant hope of conquering by force, and has realized that military aggression cannot be sustained. From now on, the situation will deteriorate daily, and all its weaknesses, both domestic and foreign, will be exposed more and more, and will become increasingly unfavorable. How could it not know that a sudden change of course, withdrawing its troops eastward, preserving its remaining strength, would still be enough to be a regional power, and that reconciliation with China would be the best strategy? However, lacking a prime minister with the魄力to reverse the situation, and lacking loyal and honest opinion leaders to stabilize public sentiment, it has adopted an inferior strategy. An inferior strategy is one that exhausts its resources internally and tires its troops externally. Internally, it binds its people like piled firewood, while placing itself on top of it. Externally, it uses coercion and deception to manipulate puppets, seeking to win through deception what it cannot win through force, and to achieve through deception what it cannot achieve through force. In reality, within the occupied areas and during the occupation period, what cannot it obtain? What is obtained is not enough to deceive the world; believing it can deceive is self-deception. Self-deception and self-misdirection are why it is called an inferior strategy. This is another aspect. Such is the current situation of both China and Japan.</p>
<p>Considering the future development and the final outcome from today's perspective, we believe that it can at least be asserted that Japan's aggression will ultimately fail. From today until the end, the development may be a straight line or may involve twists and turns; this cannot be predicted. However, it can be said that if both sides' authorities can maintain their resolve and determination, there will be fewer twists and turns, and less unnecessary loss of spirit, material, and time. On the Chinese side, it goes without saying that resistance will not be abandoned until national sovereignty and territory are fully restored, and the freedom of the nation and its political diplomacy are ensured. As for the distance between the initial stage of turning defeat into victory and the final confirmation of victory, who does not earnestly wish to shorten it to the minimum? However, it is necessary to proceed step by step, with solid and steady progress. If one is driven by impatience, seeking victory and speed, it is most likely to increase unnecessary twists and turns, which should be avoided. For example, in the past week, frequent reports of victories from the front have been met with great joy. However, how to retake Wuhan cannot be achieved solely by relying on one surge of momentum but requires careful planning. In short, the focus from now on should be on gradually achieving victory in every battle, not seeking quick victories, as this is the way to ensure a straight-line development.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, it is not yet possible to discuss this. Judging from Japan's strained efforts to conceal its defeat after the recent battles in Hunan and Jiangxi, it can be seen that Japan is not only politically self-deceptive but also has lost its minimum level of confidence in military affairs. How can it be said that it has lost confidence? Those with confidence regard victory and defeat as commonplace, seeking victory without concealing defeat. Those who conceal defeat seek to cover up all weaknesses. How can it be said that it conceals defeat? According to war reports from the Chinese side, the Japanese army feigned an attack in mid-September, launched a full-scale attack in late September, and by the beginning of this month, the Chinese army gradually gained the upper hand, launching a full-scale counterattack, capturing Yecheng on the 5th and Xiushui on the 10th, and subsequently making progress, restoring the battle lines of late September and surpassing them. There is no doubt about the victory in the battle. However, the Japanese side issued a war report on the 10th of this month, totaling two thousand words, claiming a great victory. Leaving aside the exaggerated and false rhetoric, the first section described the "Dongting Lake Forced Landing Unit" and reported up to September 29th, the second section described the "Southward Advancing Unit" and reported up to September 30th, the third section described the "Pingjiang Capture Unit" and reported up to September 28th, the fourth section described the "Tongcheng Southward Unit" and also reported up to September 29th, and the fifth section described the "Jiuling Mountain Range Unit" without specifying the date. The conclusion stated, "Leisurely absorbing the enemy's attack to conserve our strength." The war report was issued on the 10th of this month but did not mention a single word about the events within the past ten days, concealing the defeat by saying "Leisurely absorbing the enemy's attack." Comparing the dates of the reports from both sides, there is no doubt about the Japanese defeat.</p>
<p>The overall situation of the Chinese war, the final victory or defeat, has its irresistible conditions, which will not be elaborated on here. As for the battles in Hunan and Jiangxi, although China won and Japan lost, they were not the main battles that determined the victory or defeat of China and Japan. Why, then, does Japan conceal it so deeply? The general reason is nothing more than to shut off the ears and eyes of its military and civilians, in the hope of勉强maintaining its declining morale and public sentiment. There is also a special reason, which is to continue its deception in the occupied areas. Consider the main arguments of its deception, which are two: first, that China is no longer capable of resisting, and second, that Japan will definitely withdraw its troops. The former aims to make the Chinese people in the occupied areas despair of the National Government and to falsely accuse the National Government of being a source of resentment. The latter aims to use "empty promises" to disarm China's resistance and to maintain absolute control over China, which has no national defense, by stationing only a small number of troops in certain military strongholds. With this deception, it seeks to replace victory with deception, to replace victory with deceit, and to replace war with deceit! Now, China has won a great victory in Hunan and Jiangxi, and the claim that "China is no longer capable of resisting" is self-defeating. If Japan does not conceal its defeat, it will have no way to continue its deception, and it has no choice but to conceal it. If it dares not even conceal a truly undeniable defeat, can it be said that it dares to suddenly change its course or resolutely withdraw its troops? Changing course and withdrawing troops are Japan's best strategy and also the way to ensure a straight-line development. However, Japan is adopting an inferior strategy and will unnecessarily waste its spiritual strength, material resources, and time.</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Statement Insists on Original Stance, Rejects Hitler's Offer of Peace, Must Correct the Acts of Aggression Against Poland and Czechoslovakia, Acknowledging the Results of Aggression Will Damage Britain's Reputation</h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, explaining his attitude towards the peace proposals made by German leader Hitler, stating, "These proposals are based on acknowledging the results of conquest and his right to dispose of the conquered. If Britain were to accept them, it would inevitably damage its honor and abandon our long-held principle that international disputes should be resolved through negotiations and not through the use of force. In short, even if Germany were to agree to correct its misdeeds in Poland and Czechoslovakia as a prerequisite, the promises that the current government of that country can provide cannot be considered a sufficient guarantee for the future of the situation. What we require is action, not empty words. If Germany refuses to provide adequate guarantees, we will only fulfill our obligations to the end." (Havas News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Chamberlain Enumerates Hitler's Crimes, After Exhausting Military Force, He Talks About Peace Again, Difficult to Gain Trust Due to Contradictory Actions</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, explaining his attitude towards the peace proposals made by German leader Hitler, stating, "When I reported the establishment of an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union last week, I stated that Germany might put forward peace proposals, and that after these proposals were put forward, we would consider them in consultation with the governments of the self-governing dominions and France, taking into account the opinions previously expressed. Later, German leader Hitler indeed delivered a speech on the 6th of this month, and I myself immediately followed the planned steps, consulting the opinions of the self-governing dominions and the French government, and now I can explain the government's position. However, it is particularly important to first trace the background of these proposals." Recalling the end of August, the British government was negotiating with the German government on the Polish issue, at which time the situation was clearly critical, but if matters intentionally stimulating emotions could be avoided, a peaceful solution might not be impossible to obtain. We deeply knew that the German government had the power to urge its friends in the Free City of Danzig to ease the tense situation in order to conduct negotiations. Hitler had also stated that once the Polish issue was resolved, he would be willing to promote relations with Britain. We then told him that if Germany were to adopt coercive measures, Britain's obligations to the Polish nation would have to be implemented. Unfortunately, the British government's efforts to avoid the scourge of war were all in vain. This has already been known to the world. US President Roosevelt, King Leopold III of Belgium, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and Pope Pius XII also all called for peace in August of this year, but all were ineffective. Hitler's determination to use force against Poland was already obvious. Even if he was willing to establish an understanding with Britain, his actions of attacking Poland would not be delayed as a result. Finally, he violated all agreements and brazenly invaded the country. At this point, Hitler again arrogantly spoke of fulfilling agreements, which is certainly strange. To know that his use of force to satisfy his desires has already caused countless Poles and Germans to die in vain. Now, after completing the invasion, he puts forward peace proposals. We cannot help but ask, after Germany infringed upon the rights of Czechoslovakia not long ago, and then committed this great crime against humanity, do Hitler's proposals really contain any intention of making amends? Once we think deeply, we cannot help but feel disappointed. In reality, Hitler has done everything possible to humiliate Poland and its leaders. He regards part of Poland's land as being in Germany's interests, not allowing others to interfere, and wants to dispose of it according to his own interests. In short, the final disposition of Poland's territory and the issue of the country's restoration can only be resolved by Germany and the Soviet Union. The proposals he puts forward are based on acknowledging the results of conquest and his right to dispose of the conquered. If Britain were to accept them, it would inevitably damage its honor and abandon the principle that international disputes must be resolved through negotiations and not through the use of force. (The legislators cheered loudly and for a long time.) In his speech, Hitler also provided various guarantees to neighboring countries, but these countries deeply know that these guarantees have no value worth paying attention to compared with the guarantees he has provided in the past. Hitler has elaborated in great detail on the policies he is pursuing and the beliefs he holds, which are also not worth our attention. He has repeatedly spoken of the right to national self-determination, and as a result, he has incorporated millions of Czechs and Poles into Germany. He has also repeatedly attacked Bolshevism, and as a result, he has concluded an agreement with the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen that his acts of betrayal are commonplace. In a word, based on past experience, we can no longer trust the promises provided by the current German government. The policy we are pursuing is not to exclude Germany from Europe, nor to exclude a Germany that is willing to interact with other countries in friendship from Europe. On the contrary, we firmly believe that if we want to effectively address the source of chaos in the world, we must take into account the legitimate demands and needs of all countries, but we also believe that all peaceful solutions cannot be expected to be established unless they come from negotiated agreements. (Havas News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>He (the Prime Minister) informed his country's neighbors of the new assurances given by Hitler, so that they could check the same assurances Hitler had given in the past and know what value they had. Hitler has repeatedly announced Greater Germanism, and now he still incorporates millions of Polish and Czech people into the German Reich. Although he has repeatedly denounced Bolshevism, he still concludes an agreement with the Soviet Union. His words and deeds are so inconsistent that who can believe that he will suddenly reverse his policy? Therefore, based on our past experience, we can no longer trust the words issued by the current German government without strong evidence. (The crowd cheered.) Our policy is not to reject Germany from occupying a legitimate position in Europe, but this Germany must be a country that coexists with other countries in harmony and trust. We also believe that unless attention is paid to the legitimate demands and needs of all countries, an effective way to remedy the world's ailments cannot be found. The opportunity for a new peaceful resolution may come in the future, but if it is not resolved through negotiations and treaties, the hope for the future is slim. Our war is for no other reason than to defend freedom. Today, not only is the freedom of small countries in danger, but also the peaceful existence of all freedom-loving countries, whether large or small, including the self-governing dominions, India, the rest of the empire, and France, is in imminent danger. (The crowd cheered.) Looking to the future, we will see that all aspects of human thought and action will leave deep traces of change. All nations will each have their due responsibilities. The Prime Minister continued to say that the government deeply knows that in modern wars between major powers, both the winning and losing sides must love cruel losses. However, if they show submission to wrong acts, they will inevitably destroy all hope and destroy all the value of life. This value of life has been a symbol and expectation of human progress for many centuries. We do not seek to obtain significant benefits from the German people who violate their self-esteem, and we have no desires. We are not only determined to win, but we also have a goal beyond this, which is to lay a better foundation for the international system and to make war not an unavoidable event for future generations. (The crowd cheered.) Now I dare to say that all the nations of Europe, including Germany, yearn for peace, because peace can enable people to live and work in peace, without fear, and to concentrate on the development of culture, the pursuit of doctrines, and the increase of material prosperity. However, the peace we seek must be a truly stable peace, not an uneasy peace that is disturbed by times of panic and threats. At present, the obstacle to this kind of peace is the German government, and there is no other, because they have repeatedly taken aggressive actions, causing unrest throughout Europe and making all their neighbors feel insecure. He is now happy to say that the opinions of the British and French governments are completely in agreement. (The crowd cheered.) The Prime Minister then recounted the essence of French Prime Minister Daladier's speech, and the whole audience cheered loudly. He continued to say that now, taking advantage of the visit of the Polish Foreign Minister to England, he has consulted with the Polish government, and he feels that the opinions between England and Poland are completely the same, which is very gratifying. The Prime Minister finally summarized the government's attitude, saying that Hitler rejected all peace proposals before conquering Poland, and now he suddenly puts forward peace conditions. England and France find it difficult to accept them. The German government must provide sincere proof of its guarantees and undertakings, otherwise we can only persevere to the end. The Soviet, French, Polish, Argentine, Brazilian, Chinese, Spanish, and Egyptian ambassadors, as well as the ministers of the Scandinavian countries, Latvia, the Netherlands, Romania, and Nepal, were all present to listen today. Polish Foreign Minister Chaleski also sat quietly in the VIP seats. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<p>German Newspaper Views</p>
<p>Berlin - The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Foreign Political Communications," commented on French Prime Minister Daladier's speech, denying Germany's desire to dominate Europe and Germany's threats to France. It went on to say that Daladier mentioned Czechoslovakia and Poland, but these countries are centers of turmoil and endanger Germany's security. Germany must eliminate this threat with a permanent solution. The Frankfurter Zeitung stated that Daladier's speech and Hitler's proposals have the possibility of incorporating both and do not necessarily have fundamental conflicts. The French Prime Minister must carefully study Hitler's peace proposals and should be able to discover a lasting peace based on political realities. Daladier, as the French Prime Minister, has the power to decide on war and peace, but he must clearly express what the decision is, war or peace, and must not be ambiguous.

<h3>Amidst Tense Atmosphere: Finland and Soviet Union in Negotiations; Border Troops of Both Countries Confront Each Other; Soviet Union Has Proposed Four Demands</h3>
<p>Danzig: According to news received here today, Finland is preparing for an emergency situation and has mobilized 100,000 people. The current state of Finland is vastly different from 1918, as it now possesses a significant number of aircraft and munitions. Finnish civilians are currently setting up obstacles and defensive works on main roads and in the suburbs to obstruct tanks. The government here has learned that the Soviet Union has proposed four things to Finland: (1) the cession of several small islands in the Gulf of Finland to the Soviet Union; (2) the conclusion of a military alliance between Finland and the Soviet Union, but with Soviet troops not stationed within Finnish territory; (3) the establishment of new economic and political ties; and (4) the complete withdrawal of Germans from Finnish territory. Yesterday, 30,000 residents of Helsinki were evacuated. Residents of many cities and border towns have also been evacuated. Patients and the elderly in hospitals are being transported to the countryside by ambulance trains. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Representatives of the Soviet Union and Finland are scheduled to begin talks at 5:00 PM today (local time). The Finnish representative is the country's ambassador to Sweden, Mr. Passikivi. On the Soviet side, Stalin and Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov will personally attend. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The plenipotentiary representative of the Finnish government, Mr. Paasikivi, arrived here yesterday to negotiate political and economic issues between the Soviet Union and Finland. Mr. Paasikivi is accompanied by two staff members, Mr. Paasonen and Mr. Nicklops. Upon arrival at the station, they were greeted by Mr. Bakov, Director of the Treaty Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Deskov, Director of the Baltic Department, Mr. Koskinen, the Finnish Minister, and all the embassy staff, as well as Mr. Winther, the Swedish Minister, and others. (TASS, 12th)</p>
<p>London: According to a broadcast from Rome Radio, the Finnish government has stated that it is willing to make concessions to the Soviet Union, provided that the Soviet Union cedes Soviet Autonomous Republic of Karelia to Finland in exchange. It is said that the Karelian people are of Finnish ethnicity. It is heard that the Finnish Foreign Minister, Mr. Erkko, will deliver a radio address to appeal to the United States today. At the same time, the voluntary evacuation of residents of Helsinki is said to be actively underway. The Finnish people are now watching developments in Moscow. Finnish representatives, including Mr. Paasikivi, arrived in Moscow yesterday and were welcomed at the airfield by representatives of the Soviet government, personnel from the Finnish embassy, and envoys from Scandinavian countries. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington: Responsible officials here declare that if the Soviet Union still values the goodwill of the United States, it is hoped that the Soviet Union will not destroy the integrity of Finland. The Soviet Union must show restraint towards Finland, or a tragedy even worse than the currently limited war may occur. Finland has been prompt in repaying its debts and has made domestic political progress, and is therefore supported by the United States. If there is a country that the United States can regard as a small and brave new Belgium, then that country must be Finland. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Danzig: News received here this morning from Scandinavian capitals, relayed from the Finnish capital, states that the anxiety among the population caused by the authorities' implementation of civilian evacuation 24 hours ago is now gradually stabilizing. There are two reasons for this shift towards stability: (1) Moscow Radio guaranteed last night that the Soviet Union respects Finland's ties with the Nordic countries; (2) "Pravda" expressed a friendly tone towards Finland, solemnly reiterating that the Soviet Union is determined to maintain peace in Eastern Europe. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Rumors are circulating that Soviet Russia will put forward demands of a military nature, including the islands of Suursaari, Lavansaari, and Hanko in the Gulf of Finland, attempting to establish military bases at the entrance to Leningrad. Rumors are rampant here, and people are extremely worried. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Neutral observers in Helsinki have recently declared that Finnish authorities are actively engaged in military preparations. The Finnish Maritime Administration has notified all ships in the country to sail from ports in southern Finland to ports in western Finland. Foreign ships have also received similar notifications. According to Finnish sources, two Soviet military aircraft were spotted over southern Finland yesterday. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The former Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union arrived here last night from Moscow with 112 members of his staff. According to his report, Soviet troops originally stationed 20 miles from the Soviet-Finnish border have now begun to move to the vicinity of Zhytomyr. The special train carrying the Polish ambassador and his entourage was detained for six hours at the Soviet-Finnish border, allowing him to witness this situation. Finnish forces are also making considerable preparations, with 250,000 troops deployed at strategic points along the border and 125,000 militiamen on standby for mobilization. Diplomats from various countries here are pessimistic about the Finnish government's rejection of Soviet demands. According to news from the Swedish capital last night, Soviet troops have approached within 24 miles of Petsamo, the only port Finland can use to receive foreign aid in wartime. News from Danzig states that the Finnish cabinet is currently considering relocating the capital. The Finnish Navy patrolled the southwest coast last night, and anti-aircraft artillery units are stationed atop tall buildings in major cities. Citizens of major cities have begun to evacuate. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<p>The Hague: A correspondent for the "People's Daily" stationed in the Finnish capital has cabled, "The Finnish government is taking preventive measures and dealing with them calmly and systematically." Residents of the country's four major cities are being quickly evacuated, and works of art and cash reserves are being moved to safe areas. Anti-aircraft guns have been deployed on the roofs of many buildings in the capital, and a blackout has been implemented at night. As for bank depositors, withdrawals are limited to 2,000 marks (Finnish currency) per household. From these measures, it can be seen that the country is vigilant about the situation and hopes that the United States will come forward to support it. Rumors are circulating that Soviet troops are concentrating in the northern port of Murmansk. If this is true, then the Finnish port of Petsamo will be threatened. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<h3>After the Signing of the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty, Memel's Importance Weakens; Molotov Hosts a Banquet for the Lithuanian Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Moscow: After the signing of the mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union and Lithuania, the Soviet Union's control over the Baltic coast has been greatly enhanced. The only base that Germany retains in the area is the Memel region, but if the Soviet Union also stations troops near the Memel region, the commercial and political importance of the area will inevitably be greatly weakened. In the future, Germany may have no choice but to withdraw from the Memel region. As for the Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty, its validity period is set at 15 years (the mutual assistance treaties signed by the Soviet Union with Estonia and Latvia are both set at 10 years). Some of the provisions are clearly aimed at Germany. In addition, the city of Vilnius and some areas nearby have been decided to be returned to Lithuania. The area around Vilnius is barren and the people are poor, but the city is a railway hub and is of great strategic importance. Although it will nominally be owned by Lithuania again, it will in fact remain within the sphere of Soviet influence. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and concurrently Foreign Commissar, hosted a banquet last night for the Lithuanian Foreign Minister, Mr. Urbšys. Those present included Lithuanian State Councilor, Mr. Pymikas; Army Commander-in-Chief, General Raštikis; the Lithuanian Minister, Mr. Nakevičius; the Minister of Economy, Mr. Norkaitis; and other officials, as well as Soviet dignitaries such as Stalin, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Kalinin, Kaganovich, Zhdanov, Bulganin, Voznesensky, Kuznetsov, Smolodinov, Lozovsky, and Poznyakov. During the banquet, Molotov and Urbšys exchanged toasts, and the atmosphere was exceptionally cordial. (TASS, 11th)</p>
<p>Kaunas: Thousands of people here cheered in front of the Soviet Embassy last night because the Vilnius region, which Poland had seized from Lithuania in 1920, has now been returned to Lithuania. According to reliable sources, in accordance with the newly concluded Soviet-Lithuanian treaty, "for the sake of mutual security," Soviet troops may be stationed in various locations within Lithuania, except for the Lithuanian capital of Kaunas and other major industrial cities. Once the Lithuanian government moves to Vilnius, the Soviet troops stationed there will be withdrawn. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Lithuanian Foreign Minister, Mr. Urbšys, accompanied by State Councilor, Mr. Piusys; and Army Commander-in-Chief, Mr. Nastickas; came here the other day to negotiate the conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty and the return of the city of Vilnius. The negotiations have been completed, and they are returning to their country today. Regarding the territory that Soviet Russia has agreed to return to Lithuania, the Soviet Russian authorities have already prepared for the transfer, but the implementation of administrative and economic reorganization, formal integration into Lithuania, and restoration of customs checkpoints will take several months. It is reported that the Soviet-Lithuanian agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union may station 20,000 troops in the three towns of Klem, Veiveriai, and Kaisiadorys in Lithuania, and 2,000 air force personnel at various air bases. (Haitong, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: A dispatch from the "Paris Daily News" correspondent in Amsterdam states that after Germany concluded an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union, it withdrew from the Baltic countries. It is heard that key figures in the National Socialist Party and the German military are greatly dissatisfied with this. Some of these people participated in the organization of German Free Corps in the Baltic countries and now feel that it is an incomprehensible sacrifice for Germany to abandon its inherent position in countries where culture originated in Germany. Great disapproval. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet "Pravda" on Policy of Peace; Significance of Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty</h3>
<p>Moscow: An editorial in "Pravda" states, "The Soviet Union's policy of peace and good neighborliness has recently seen repeated successes. Yesterday, the Soviet Union returned the province and city of Vilnius to Lithuania, and the Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty has also been signed. Through this treaty, as well as the Soviet-Estonian and Soviet-Latvian treaties, the Soviet Union has further consolidated its borders and national defense. The threat of imperialist powers to the Soviet Union's neighbors has now been eliminated. An iron line of defense has been established in the Baltic Sea, and a stable peace has been established in Eastern Europe. Our people should be extremely satisfied with the signing of this treaty. Our people should support the government's wise policy, because this policy can ensure the peace and inviolability of our country through friendly treaties with our neighbors. Today, with the European war raging, Stalin's policy of peace is gradually and consistently eliminating the risk of various small countries being drawn into the war, as these small countries cannot defend their independence, security, and the peaceful labor of their people by their own strength.</p>
<p>"The significance of the signing of the Soviet-Lithuanian treaty is great, and it is an important part of the Soviet-Lithuanian policy of friendship promoted by the Soviet government for twenty years. At the same time, it is the most complete expression of the principle of mutual assistance between the two friendly countries and the principle of jointly protecting the borders of Lithuania.</p>
<p>"Lithuania was originally established under the unstable conditions of the Treaty of Versailles and the re-division of the world. At that time, the major imperialist countries arbitrarily divided Europe. The Lithuanian people found it difficult to resist Polish aggression. The Soviet Union was the first to recognize the Republic of Lithuania and provide assistance. Other countries recognized it only after that. In 1920, the Polish warlords forcibly occupied the ancient Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. The imperialist countries at the time all recognized this, but only the Soviet Union firmly protested and did not recognize it as Polish territory. The Soviet people only had sympathy for the Lithuanian people's struggle against Polish misrule.</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union and Lithuania concluded a non-aggression treaty in 1926, which was extended in 1934. After the disintegration of Poland, a new situation has arisen. The Red Army has liberated Ukrainians and Belarusians who were oppressed by Polish imperialism, as well as the city of Vilnius, which was forcibly occupied by Polish warlords for about twenty years. The Soviet Union and Lithuania have become neighbors, and the border is in the process of being demarcated. Based on this new situation and the newly emerging national defense issues, the Soviet Union and Lithuania, starting from their old friendly relations, have resolved all important matters based on the principle of mutual assistance and respect for the interests and security of both countries. From now on, the borders of Lithuania will be protected by joint military forces, and the Soviet Union will also enhance its national defense. The Soviet-Lithuanian treaty fully embodies the principle of mutual assistance. Our country has been guaranteed, and Lithuania has also met its national interests. This kind of good-neighborly policy can be followed by all countries in the world.</p>
<p>"Since ancient times, the history of international diplomacy has been soaked in blood, and wars can never be eliminated. To this day, they remain a threat to human life and cultural development, but the Soviet Union alone can peacefully resolve various diplomatic issues. The reason for this is that the foreign policy of a socialist country is a policy of peace and friendship towards all countries. The foundation of the Lenin-Stalin policy is friendship between nations, and all the people of the Soviet Union support it. The Soviet Union has now set an example for the world in peacefully resolving the most difficult diplomatic issues and building friendly relations between all nations." (TASS, 11th)</p>
<h3>Trade Agreement Concluded Between Soviet Union and United Kingdom; Britain Exchanges Rubber and Tin for Soviet Lumber; Agreement is Commercial in Nature, With No Political Significance</h3>
<p>London: According to official sources, the British Ministry of Supply and the Soviet trade delegation in London today concluded an agreement to exchange Soviet lumber for British rubber and tin. This is commercial in nature and has nothing to do with politics, as the above-mentioned items are part of Anglo-Soviet trade. The official announcement mentions the shipping obstacles after the Soviet ports freeze, and says that the difficulties arising from the revocation of export licenses have affected many timbers that cannot be shipped out. The purpose of this negotiation is to enable the items needed by both Britain and the Soviet Union to circulate. The tin purchased by the Soviet Union is mostly paid for on a periodic basis in accordance with long-term commercial contracts. The prices of all lumber, rubber, and tin are pre-agreed, and the value of the exchanged goods will be absolutely equal. The quantity depends on what can be shipped out of the northern ports before the ice season. It is expected that the above-mentioned agreement is only the first result of Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Today, Liberal Party member Mandle, an opposition member, asked the government in the Lower House what action it would take regarding the Soviet government's proposal to the UK to reopen commercial negotiations. Foreign Undersecretary Butler replied that the issue of adapting Anglo-Soviet trade relations to the state of war is being considered. The British government is currently discussing some preliminary difficulties with the Soviet government. Mandle asked again whether the British government wanted to conduct these negotiations. Butler replied that if Mandle was referring to Minister for Overseas Trade Hudson traveling to Moscow, there was no suggestion of reopening commercial talks at that time. Mandle considered this answer unsatisfactory and declared that he would raise the matter again. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London: According to official sources, representatives of the British Ministry of Supply have signed a barter agreement with the Soviet trade delegation, stipulating that Britain will exchange tin and rubber for Soviet timber. According to well-informed sources here, this agreement is purely commercial and has no political significance. The Soviet Union usually exports timber to Britain and imports tin and rubber from Britain. Due to the approaching winter, some Soviet ports will soon freeze, and cargo ships must leave before the ports are closed. Therefore, it is urgent to sign an agreement with Britain. Soviet sources say that the two sides have exchanged goods, but the Soviet government is still unable to guarantee the safety of transportation, and Britain must send warships to escort them.

<h3>158,000 British Troops Arrived in France; German Air Force Ordered to Continue Bombing British Ships; All Activity Greatly Increased on Western Front</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German Air Force has been ordered to continue attacking British ships blockading the North Sea. This is considered the most important instruction since the end of the Polish campaign. At the same time, German aircraft are now preparing to launch a major attack on the British fleet if Hitler's peace proposals are rejected. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>London: The Admiralty has just issued a communiqué stating that several German aircraft attacked our fleet of cruisers in the North Sea on the 9th of this month. The two sides exchanged fire for five hours. The enemy aircraft dropped no fewer than a hundred bombs, several of which fell near one of the cruisers, causing shrapnel to fall on the ship. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency published the results of the German naval and air force activities in the North Sea, saying that in recent days, German naval vessels have been ordered to concentrate in the northern North Sea to protect merchant ships, search for contraband, and protect shipping. On the morning of the 9th of this month, after a German reconnaissance plane discovered a British ship at the southern tip of Norway, it sent a radio report. The German Air Force and seaplanes immediately flew to bomb it. Although the weather was bad and the British ship's anti-aircraft fire was fierce, the German aircraft still hit the British ship with six heavy bombs and several medium bombs. The German aircraft flew back to base in the middle of the night, flying non-stop on the sea for eight to ten hours. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: French Air Force Minister Chambe today told the Senate Aviation Committee that although there were more German aircraft than French aircraft in the repeated air battles, French fighter aircraft were indeed superior to German aircraft. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 75, stating that "Enemy reconnaissance units continued to conduct reconnaissance between the Saar River and the Inselles River today and were very active. The two sides exchanged fire in the same area." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Paris: The German Commander-in-Chief seems to want to obtain information about the French army's positions and strength along the Rhine and Moselle Rivers. The German army has not engaged in large-scale attacks with dense infantry, but has repeatedly attacked with small patrols in an attempt to gather information and capture prisoners in order to find out the truth from the prisoners' mouths. However, the German attacking teams were blocked by machine guns and light artillery fire. German reconnaissance planes are active and frequently take oblique photographs of French defenses from behind the German lines. Yesterday, taking advantage of the bad atmosphere, they took a few vertical photographs of the French lines. Semi-official sources here claim that the reason for the German activity is that the Germans have decided to recover lost ground and fear that high water in the Rhine River will flood the German forward positions. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German Army Commander-in-Chief announced the war situation on each front at noon today, as follows: (1) On the Eastern Front, German troops reached the Bug River in central Poland; (2) On the Western Front, there was only insignificant artillery fire; (3) There was reconnaissance activity in the skies over the North Sea; (4) An air battle took place in Wittenburg, and a French aircraft was shot down. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>London: British War Secretary Hore-Belisha gave the first report on the actions of British troops in wartime in the Lower House today, saying that within five weeks of the outbreak of war, Britain had sent 158,000 soldiers to France. Britain has fulfilled its obligations to France by sending a certain number of troops to assist France within a certain period of time. More troops will continue to cross the English Channel and go to the front lines. During this period, we have re-established bases and lines of communication, and organized everything so that various supplies and munitions can be shipped out in a continuous stream. The main procedures have now been arranged. Today's work is very different from 1914. At that time, Britain had only 800 mechanical vehicles, and there were not many with a load of more than two tons. Today, we have transported more than 25,000 mechanical vehicles, including tanks, to France, some of which are very large and weigh more than 15 tons. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London: War Secretary Hore-Belisha made a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, saying, "After the British army arrived in France, it was placed under the command of the French Commander-in-Chief, so military orders have been unified. If the British commander has any opinions, he can submit them to the British Cabinet, but since the opinions of Britain and France are completely consistent, there is almost no need to exercise this right of speech, and when necessary, the French army can also be placed under the command of the British Commander-in-Chief." He then answered a question from a member, saying, "The British troops sent to France are well-equipped and second to none, and their supplies are very sufficient. This can be proven by people from neutral countries, such as Americans. This army is now divided into two armies, with General Dill as the commander of the First Army and General Brooke as the commander of the Second Army. In addition, the British garrison and military equipment in the Near East have also been greatly strengthened. In short, the number of expeditionary forces sent by Britain to France has so far met or exceeded our obligations to France and is sufficient for all of you. The troops currently being dispatched are not the last batch. Compared with the situation in 1914, the infantry now accounts for 20 percent, and each battalion is equipped with 50 machine guns and 21 defensive guns. In 1914, the infantry accounted for 60 percent, so the firepower of this expeditionary force far exceeds that of before. The front-line soldiers are now busy building fortifications to consolidate their positions. As for the country, we will still need to greatly conscript manpower in the future. Each conscripted troop will also recruit volunteers. Since the outbreak of the war, there have been 50,000 of these volunteers. Those who are older will be organized into the National Defence Force to protect this headquarters." (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>German-Bulgarian Trade Negotiations Successfully Concluded</h3>
<p>Sofia: Economic negotiations between Germany and Bulgaria, conducted here, were successfully concluded yesterday.

<p>Bulgarian Capital: Trade negotiations between Germany and Bulgaria have been going on for a long time. Several agreements have now been reached to supplement the current trade treaty and offset agreement. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>British Warship Intercepts German Ship</h3>
<p>London: The German ship "Cap Norte" was intercepted by a British warship in the southern Atlantic Ocean after departing from the Brazilian port of Pernambuco on the 17th of last month. The ship has a displacement of 13,615 tons. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Information Office has just released a message stating that the French Navy's implementation of the blockade of Germany has had significant effects since the 10th of this month. A total of 150,000 tons of contraband destined for Germany has been seized, of which 40,000 tons are of various metal ores, including tungsten, antimony, nickel, and mercury, which are needed by German war industries, 40,000 tons of grain, and more than 30,000 tons of liquid fuel.

<h3>Expansion of the Japanese Foreign Ministry Crisis: A Potential for a Cabinet Crisis; 106 People Resign Jointly; Officials at Overseas Embassies and Consulates Respond One after Another</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The wave of resignations at the Foreign Ministry, triggered by the Cabinet's decision to establish a Ministry of Trade, now threatens to cause a cabinet crisis. A total of 106 people have resigned from the Foreign Ministry. The resignations were submitted to the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs last night. A committee composed of department directors and senior officials convened yesterday afternoon to await new proposals from Foreign Minister Nomura. After waiting until 7:30 PM, no new proposals were forthcoming. The committee then convened a general meeting of 120 senior officials in the Foreign Ministry conference room. During the meeting, the head of the Intelligence Bureau, Tatsuo Kawai, entered the venue and declared his willingness to join. After the head of the Research Bureau reported on the committee's work, the head of the Documentation Department addressed the assembly. Subsequently, the entire assembly unanimously approved the committee's measures and decided that there was no other option but to resign, as all compromises had failed. The resignations were then collected and handed to Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani Masayuki, who agreed to submit them to the Foreign Minister this morning. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Foreign Ministry Vice Minister Tani submitted the resignations of all senior officials below the rank of section chief to Foreign Minister Nomura on the afternoon of the 12th. Feeling responsible for the situation, he also submitted his resignation. (Domei News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Regarding the Ministry of Trade issue, many officials in overseas embassies and consulates share the same views as the administrative authorities of the Foreign Ministry. Personnel at various consulates in China are currently collecting resignations through their respective consuls. The resignations from the consulates in Nanjing, Hankou, and Shanghai have already been collected. In Europe and the Americas, the collection of resignations is being handled by Consul General to New York Wakasugi, Consul to Cuba Nakata, Minister to Argentina Uchiyama, Counselor to the Embassy in the Soviet Union Shichida, Ambassador to the UK Shigemitsu, Chargé d'affaires to France Miyazaki, Consul to Paris Akiyama, and Consul to Batavia Saito. (Domei, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Prime Minister Abe met with Foreign Minister Nomura at 9:00 AM on the 12th, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Tang Ze participating, to discuss a compromise on the trade issue. A meeting will be held at the International Association at 2:00 PM on the 12th to discuss the matter. (Domei, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Regarding the Ministry of Trade issue, Prime Minister Abe, Foreign Minister Nomura, and Minister of Interior Ogawa held discussions on the morning of the 12th. As a result, they decided to communicate the government's opinions to the senior officials of the Foreign Ministry. As for the content of trade negotiations, the right to decide and the right to appoint and dismiss commercial officials, which the authorities have insisted on in the past, there is ample room for consideration when establishing a concrete plan within the preparatory committee for the new ministry in the future. As for the handling of the resignations, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani was instructed to return each resignation to its original submitter. Foreign Minister Nomura's explanation and the efforts of senior Foreign Ministry officials such as Mr. Aizawa were also instrumental in achieving this. After completing discussions with relevant cabinet ministers at the Prime Minister's official residence, Foreign Minister Nomura met with Prime Minister Abe at 12:20 PM to exchange views on policies and opinions regarding the handling of various situations, and then departed at 2:45 PM.

<h3>Japanese Authorities Review Raw Material Issues</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese officials convened a meeting here to re-examine the mobilization plan for various raw materials in Japan, Manchuria, and the occupied areas of China in light of the potential impact of the European war. It is reported that this meeting is currently discussing taking necessary steps to revise the procedures previously proposed to expand production and facilitate control. Yesterday was the third day of the meeting. Mr. Uemura of the Cabinet Planning Board explained the procedures for expanding industrial strength and mentioned the cotton problem. Hoshino, Director-General of the General Affairs Department of the Manchurian State Council, arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday to attend the meeting and will stay here for about ten days. It is expected that he will explain the details of Manchuria's revised raw material mobilization plan during this period. Hoshino may also seek to make further revisions. It is rumored that Manchuria has decided to postpone non-essential industrial projects and concentrate its efforts on increasing coal and iron production in view of the new difficulties encountered in implementing the original five-year plan due to the inability to obtain raw materials from Europe.

<h3>Smooth Progress in Soviet-Turkish Negotiations; Soviet-Turkish and British-Turkish Agreements Expected to Be Signed Soon</h3>
<p>Ankara – According to a communiqué, Turkish Prime Minister Saydam explained the Soviet-Turkish negotiations in detail to the members of the Republican People's Party today. The party expressed its agreement with the government's views. Political circles believe that the new Soviet-Turkish treaty and the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance pact will both be signed soon. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London – According to reliable sources yesterday, the Soviet-Turkish agreement will be signed within 24 hours, and the British-Turkish interim agreement will follow. However, it is doubtful whether it can be signed immediately so that Prime Minister Chamberlain can report to Parliament today. The British-Turkish agreement will include clauses on military assistance in the event of aggression in the Mediterranean and German aggression against the Balkan countries. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>The Milanese newspaper, "Sparta", received a report from Cairo stating how Egypt and other Arab countries must react to Turkey's attitude. The entire Arab world, from the Nile to the Tigris, has been completely focused on Turkey's attitude for the past four weeks. Egypt is particularly interested in observing the development of Turkey's situation. If Greece were to encounter difficulties, Turkey would defend the Suez Canal and the Nile Delta, given Egypt's participation in the democratic front. However, there are now fears that Turkey may join forces with Germany and the Soviet Union. If a world war were to occur, Turkey would not only fail to protect the Suez Canal but might even invade it. Therefore, after receiving intelligence about the Turkish Foreign Minister's activities in Moscow, the Egyptian government was alarmed. The Arabs believe that although Britain is quickly dispatching troops and aircraft to Egypt, continuing military deployments, and establishing defenses on the borders of Iraq and India, Britain will still fail if it cannot obtain Turkey's assistance. The newspaper also stated that the Cairo-published "Al-Ahram" newspaper received a report from Istanbul stating that the Soviet Union is strongly urging Turkey not to allow British and French naval, land, and air forces to pass through its territory if Britain and France send troops to Romania. Turkish officials firmly believe that the Soviet Union is determined to prevent British and French forces from reaching the Black Sea and to provide Romania with assistance. "Al-Mokattam" reported that the Soviet Union's sole reason for preserving Turkey is that they know Turkey's opinions regarding the Soviet Union and will obey orders. This point is very important for the countries of the Near East and the Middle East and should not be overlooked. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Warships Visit Estonia; Soviet-Estonian Military Negotiations Successfully Concluded</h3>
<p>Estonian Capital – Three Soviet destroyers visited here yesterday. When the Soviet warships entered the harbor, they fired a 21-gun salute, and the Estonian coastal artillery also fired a salute in response. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>Moscow – An official communiqué was recently released stating that negotiations between Soviet and Estonian military experts have been successfully concluded. The Soviet government has also invited General Laidoner, Chief of the General Staff of the Estonian Army, to visit for consultations, but the date has not yet been determined. In addition, a Latvian economic delegation will come here to negotiate a trade treaty. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Latvian Capital – The Soviet military delegation has been conducting negotiations with the Estonian military delegation for several days. Both sides have expressed agreement on the matter of extending the entry of Soviet troops into Estonian territory until October 19. Now that the Soviet-Estonian military negotiations have been completed, part of the Soviet delegation has already left the Estonian capital. According to newspaper reports, the Estonian President has confirmed the signing of a draft Soviet-Estonian agreement. It is reported that the Estonian Commander-in-Chief of the Army is scheduled to announce the conclusion of the Soviet-Estonian military agreement on the radio today. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>Germany Issues Winter Relief Stamps</p>
<p>Berlin – The German Postal Administration has decided to issue commemorative stamps for winter relief, with denominations of 3 pfennigs, 5 pfennigs, 6 pfennigs, 8 pfennigs, 12 pfennigs, 25 pfennigs, and several others.

<h3>US Senate Debates Arms Embargo Issue; Two Factions of Senators Engage in Heated Debate; Bora Advocates Freedom of Navigation in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Washington – The Senate continued to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment today. Senator Clark, a Democratic separatist, delivered a speech advocating the maintenance of the arms embargo, speaking eloquently for four hours. His arguments were based on isolationist viewpoints. Senator Burke, a Democrat, advocated for the repeal of the arms embargo, saying that the current Neutrality Act benefits Germany and cannot be defended in the name of neutrality. Senator Gna, a Republican, also spoke, reversing his original position and announcing his decision to vote in favor of repealing the arms embargo. The discussion today can be said to have gone deep into the details. Clark presented the isolationist viewpoint and criticized President Roosevelt's attitude and that of Republican Senator Johnson (who had proposed that President Roosevelt mediate the European war). Burke, who was originally a separatist, has now returned to the government faction and was the first to say that the American people are also interested in the current war in Europe ideologically, but he did not advocate that the United States cooperate with Britain and France in the war. Political figures say that Burke's speech today was supported by most people. The Democratic government faction had originally not mentioned their ideological views on the European war, fearing that mentioning ideology would hinder the repeal of the arms embargo. Burke was able to say what others had not said, which gained unexpected support. The isolationists, who had wanted to use ideological viewpoints to achieve victory, were amazed by Burke's speech. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington – Senator Clark, a Missouri isolationist Democrat, launched a fierce attack yesterday during the Senate debate on the Neutrality Act amendment against Assistant Secretary of War Johnson's proposal to increase the army to 600,000, calling it "delirious, childish, and unpatriotic." He said that Johnson was trying to incite a war mentality among the public. Clark called the Neutrality Act amendment "their goal" to enable the Allied nations of Europe to receive American aid. "If we want to participate in defending Britain and France, it is a suicidal policy." Clark suggested prohibiting the transport of arms and other materials to belligerent countries, and that cash-and-carry be used for other goods. Clark also attacked Johnson, saying that Johnson had illegally established a war raw materials association and filled it with people from Morgan and DuPont. Although President Roosevelt had declared that the association had been disbanded, they continued to work. Clark's speech was the main program for isolationists to attack the Neutrality Act amendment. The Senate corridors were filled with listeners. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>

<h3>Formation of the Soviet Provincial Mobilization Committee: "Don't Give Soldiers to the Enemy Association"; Strive to Prevent Strong Men from Being Conscripted by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese army often forcibly conscripts strong men in the occupied areas to be used by them. The Jiangsu Provincial Mobilization Committee of the Lu-Su War Zone was recently ordered to organize a "Don't Give Soldiers to the Enemy League" to thwart the Japanese army's plan. The committee will immediately work with the Political Training Department of the Lu-Su War Zone Deputy Commander-in-Chief Headquarters to formulate temporary measures for the organization of the "Jiangsu People's Don't Give Soldiers to the Enemy League" and its county branches. These measures will be submitted to the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Lu-Su War Zone for approval and implementation.

<h3>Japanese Army in Jiangyin Attacked During Rural Propaganda Campaign</h3>
<p>Fantasies of Collecting Land Tax Also Suffer Blows</p>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The four townships of Jiangyin have long been controlled by guerrilla forces, but the Japanese and puppet sides often attempt to collect land taxes from the four townships. In the past half-month, Japanese Police Captain Shigeno has repeatedly led Japanese troops and puppet police to the townships for propaganda. They have visited Xin'jie, Shengangbei, and other places. On the third of this month, they took a car to Qingyang, arriving at Qiaoqi at 7:00 PM. After resting for an hour, they went to Changshou, distributing absurd leaflets and posting slogans along the way. After staying overnight in Changshou, they set off for Zhutang on the fourth. When they reached the Dazhai Liujiaji area, someone reported that there were weapons hidden there. The Japanese army searched and took away a small number of guns and bullets. At noon, they reached the Hudaqiao Xiaoliujiaji area, which is where the guerrillas are located. They did not encounter them. They found several armed items somewhere and set them on fire. They stayed overnight at Hudaqiao that night. On the morning of the fifth, they returned to Zhutang. After breakfast, they traveled half a mile and encountered a large number of guerrillas. Guns and cannons were fired simultaneously. They opened fire in the Zhoujiaji area. Both sides suffered casualties. The Japanese army was almost surrounded but later broke through and went to Hehuqiao. In the middle of the night, they were attacked again by the Chinese army. The Japanese army only fired machine guns indiscriminately in the dark. On the sixth, they went to Mencun Xiyangqiao and went straight to Huangtang for lunch. Then they stayed overnight at Zhutang. At 3:00 AM on the morning of the seventh, the Chinese army from Yangjiazhuang attacked. Fearing being blocked, the Japanese army retreated to Huangtang for lunch and walked to Qingyang to return to the city. The Japanese army suffered a considerable blow during this trip to the townships, and collecting land taxes has become a fantasy.</p>
<h3>Atrocity of Japanese Warships in Guangdong Sea in Hailufeng: Burning Defenseless Fishing and Salt Boats, Over 1,000 Vessels Destroyed in Two Days</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese army in Chaoshan has been besieged for more than a month. They failed twice to break through to Fengxi and Yuntishan and were defeated miserably twice in attacking Sangshan (once from Shan Hong'an to Shaxi, and once from Anbu to Jiaoshi). They have resorted to using the strength of the marine fleet to harass Waiqian in an attempt to relieve the siege of Chaoshan. They initially invaded Raoping, Zhelin, and Haishan, but after failing, they turned to the Hailufeng area and were extremely brutal. All of this happened in late September. The Chinese army was already waiting in ambush in the mountains of ×××××× to annihilate the Japanese army in Chaoshan and along the coast.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of September 24, a huge Japanese warship suddenly docked at Daya Bay Port in Haifeng. Two destroyers arrived in the waters of Daa. On the morning of the 25th, two aircraft were dispatched from the warship to scout along the coast. Three bombs were dropped on Dazhou and Erzhou. They bombed the ports of Fei, Xunliao, and Xinliao, sinking more than a dozen fishing boats. At 9:00 AM, more than 300 soldiers were dispatched on more than 20 boats and landed in three batches to harass Gangkou Town. The local guard team and salt police team fought bravely. The Chinese army was too small in number and retreated to Pinghai City. The Japanese soldiers looted Gangkou Town and then took boats to Touliao, Xiazhai, Danjialiao, and other places, setting fire to salt boats, fishing boats, fishing boats, and houseboat. In one day, 240 boats were burned. They then turned to Magong and other places. On the 26th, more than 400 boats were burned. More than 80% of the boats in Shanwei Port were burned. There were more than 3,000 fishermen and salt workers who suffered. On the 27th, more than 20 motorboats were dispatched to carry more than 200 soldiers and landed in the areas of Renyou Fanggang, Xunliao, and Xingang, burning more than 200 fishing boats. On the 28th, a huge Japanese warship arrived off the coast of Jinxiang in Lufeng. Five motorboats were dispatched at Haiziai, dragging rubber boats to carry more than 100 soldiers, and aircraft were used to cover them in chasing the fishing and salt boats along the coast. As a result, ten large fishing boats were burned, and the fishing boats that escaped to the Jieshi warship were shelled, sinking several. This is a miracle of the Japanese Navy's war, specializing in intimidating fishing and salt boats.</p>

<h3>First Battle After Returning to Hong Kong: South China Defeats Hong Kong League in the Rain - 4 to 1, Halftime Tied at 1 Each - Hui Tang, Dou Wen, and Zhaorong All Score Big</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) The South China Football Team returned from a long expedition and played its first game yesterday (the 1st), facing the Hong Kong League team at the Jia Shan Stadium. A large number of spectators came to watch. Li Tiansheng, Feng Jingxiang, and Zhang Rongcai of South China were injured, and Liu Qingcai had returned to Macau, so they were not present. Tan Jun'gan took over as goalkeeper. They initially played with ten men, and the Hong Kong League took the opportunity to score a goal. Guo Yingqi arrived after twelve minutes, and the situation improved. The score was one-to-one at halftime, with no clear winner. After switching sides, they fought in the rain, and South China scored three consecutive goals, ultimately defeating the Hong Kong League with a score of four to one.</p>

<p>Luo Douwen, Li Zhaorong, Li Huitang, Chen Dehui, Deng Guangsen</p>
<p>Deng Qin</p>
<p>Shi Han, Bi Liban</p>
<p>Xu Jingcheng, Ge Fu, Fei Shiwo Sheng</p>
<p>Hou Chengtao, Hua Liya, He Xi, Zuo Zhi, Zhong Yongsen</p>
<p>Hong Kong League Team Scores First</p>
<p>After seven minutes, the Hong Kong League team launched a fierce attack on South China. Hua Liya was like a cunning rabbit, weaving through key areas. He took a pass from Yongsen and headed it towards the center, where He Xi and Chengtao both sprinted forward. Hou Chengtao kicked nimbly and scored (1-0). After South China conceded a goal, Yingqi joined the team after sixteen minutes to make up the numbers. Their morale was boosted. Douwen received a pass from the midfield and took a cold, angled shot with great force, but it was caught by Deng Qin. After thirty minutes, Hua Liya again aimed like drawing a bow, taking the path of least resistance, and passed diagonally to Zuo Zhi. The prodigy Zuo Zhi fired a long-range shot that hit the post and bounced out. Lingsheng arrived in time and cleared the ball with a kick. Huitang took the ball and advanced fiercely, attempting a solo attack on the goal. Deng Qin dived to save it, narrowly avoiding disaster. After thirty-five minutes, Zhaorong created an opportunity in the Hong Kong League's defense and lightly passed it to Huitang. Huitang turned around and swept the ball, which flew like an arrow, diagonally into the net from under the crossbar, tying the score at one-to-one.</p>
<p>South China Scores Three Consecutive Goals</p>
<p>After eight minutes, heavy rain began to pour. Huitang created confusion in the middle, and Bi Liban was unable to intercept him, falling to the ground. Huitang sent a wink, and Douwen intercepted the ball and took an angled shot. Deng Qin was unaware of the ball's trajectory, and the goal was lost (2-1). After seventeen minutes, Huitang took a long-range shot from about forty yards, hitting the crossbar. Zhaorong seized the opportunity, charged straight in, and scored with a close-range shot, making it three-to-one. After twenty-four minutes, the Hong Kong League briefly launched a fierce attack on South China. Guowei and Shaohan were extremely busy. Tan Jun'gan finally caught He En's header and kicked it to Huitang. Dehui and Huitang advanced together, and then passed it to Guangsen. Guangsen shot the ball down the left side, and Zhuoni Wen repeated his old trick, scoring another goal, making it four-to-one. The southern expedition army declared victory.</p>
<h3>East Surrey Defeats West Force - 3 to 1</h3>
<p>The reserve members of the British East Surrey and the Scottish West Force met on the field the day before Double Ten, resulting in a 3-1 defeat for the Scottish army.  The main forces of both sides met again at Yiyuan at 3:15 pm yesterday before the league matches began. As a result, the Scottish army suffered another crushing defeat, with the score also being 3-1, which was quite a coincidence. The match was extremely intense. West Force's goalkeeper Egginson, left-back Kai Moer, and center-back Maxgan were all seriously injured. East Surrey led by two goals to zero at halftime.</p>
<h3>Zhou Dayun and Cai Yanxiong Perform in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun came from Shanghai and specially invited comrades in Hong Kong to hastily form the Shanghai basketball team. The movie emperor Jin Yan also participated. The time was short and there was no way to change the schedule. They originally intended to invite the Hong Kong champion South China team, but it was temporarily unavailable. Later, through the mediation of Guo Mukai, a sports official from the YMCA, they invited the Star Island team, which was composed of former YMCA players, to play against them. After the decision was made, they also found Feng Nianhua and Xu Heng. The YMCA then issued a notice of the ball game.</p>
<p>Match</p>
<p>The game started at eight o'clock. The skills of both sides were not as ideally exciting. The Shanghai United team was, after all, a temporary combination, and encountered such a small field. The connection was not perfect, but the individual techniques were quite good. Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun were especially admired by the fans. Jin Yan played not badly. Yanxiong's snatching skills and fancy ball handling were all applauded. Dayun's sideline shots were well received. The Star Island team's playing style did not deviate from its old style. The field was small, the contact was tight, the game was dragging, and there were many fouls. Li Guoduo and Chen Shipin committed four fouls each and were dismissed, which was a flaw.</p>
<p>The Shanghai United team led all the way, taking a lead of 20 to 15 in the first half. After switching sides, they continued their efforts and ended the whole game with a score of 40 to 25. The Shanghai United team was often careless in penalty shots, missing many, which was a great disadvantage. Otherwise, they could have made a bigger score. The closest the Star Island team came was in the first half when the score was 6 to 9, but in the second half, the difference was too far at 18 to 33. Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun will leave here today and go their separate ways. No one knows when the Shanghai United team will return to the battlefield. The scores of the two teams are listed below.</p>

<h3>Finance: The Situation Worsens Daily, Spot Gold Plunges Again, Reaching a Low of 3930 Yuan - A Situation of Easy Decline and Difficult Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market continued its downward trend. The reason is that both domestic and international news were unfavorable, causing many to suffer losses. The general traders in the market mostly aimed for small profits, and few stored gold for the long term. The trend was that whenever there was a slight increase in buying, it was not easy to raise prices, and when selling, it was easy to decline.  In yesterday's situation, the market opened flat and weak at 3,995 yuan.  Soon after, the securities firms bought in, and at the same time, the foreign exchange rate softened slightly. Gold firms also followed suit, breaking through the 4,000 yuan mark again, reaching a high of 4,020 yuan.  Then, as money changers sold out, the price returned to the 4,000 yuan mark.  Although Hong Kong firms bought in more than 200 taels, the high price was difficult to sustain for long due to the easing of foreign exchange rates and the imbalance of supply and demand.  By noon, it had fallen to only 3,955 yuan.  In the afternoon, the gold firms reappeared, and the foreign exchange rate continued to be strong, creating a new low price of 3,930 yuan.  Suddenly, Hong Kong firms slightly bought in a small amount, and the situation stabilized.  It closed at 3,940 yuan, a further drop of 60 yuan. Trading throughout the day was smooth, about 1,300 to 1,400 taels.  Gold jewelry was priced at a small five yuan.  Customs gold and other gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Fell Another 60 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial situation after the lunar festival was relatively peaceful. The opening price was 5 yuan lower than the previous close. A certain gold firm sold 30 taels to the securities firms for 3,995 yuan. After the opening, the securities firms' buying was still strong, and they frequently raised bids. Soon, it rose by 15 yuan. The securities firms bought 10 taels from the money changers at a price of 4,010 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate softened slightly, and a certain gold firm also tracked and bought, causing the price to rise another 10 yuan. A certain gold firm bought 20 taels from a certain money changer for 4,020 yuan. However, the foreign exchange rate suddenly strengthened, and a certain money changer aggressively sold at a high price, causing the price to fall. Before long, it fell back by 20 yuan. At that time, a certain silver firm bought in on behalf of the Hong Kong firms, and colleagues, money changers, and gold firms bought a total of 260 taels, all at a price of 4,000 yuan. Later, retail investors followed suit, and the price once rebounded to 4,004 yuan. After that, because the selling pressure rose again, silver firms and spot gold firms frequently sold, and a certain securities firm also sold out. In addition, the Hong Kong firms were cautious and did not move forward, causing the price to fall again, eventually falling by 38 yuan. A silver firm sold 20 taels to the money changers for 3,966 yuan. At that time, another securities firm came to absorb it and rebounded by 14 yuan. The securities firms bought 10 taels from the money changers at a price of 3,980 yuan. At noon, a certain money changer sold on behalf of the shorts, and the spot gold firms still had a strong desire to sell, causing the price to fall another 25 yuan. A spot gold firm sold 20 taels to the silver firms for 3,955 yuan. Then, the money changers traded 30 taels among themselves for 3,956 yuan as the closing price for the afternoon. The initial opening in the afternoon was flat. Initially, a gold firm sold 20 taels to the money changers for 3,955 yuan. At that time, the spot gold firms still had a strong desire to sell, and the foreign exchange rate continued to strengthen slightly, causing the price to fall by 25 yuan. The money changers sold 20 taels to the spot gold firms for 3,930 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm bought at a low price on behalf of customers, once rebounding to 3,955 yuan. After entering, because retail investors resumed selling, they entrusted the money changers to sell, causing the price to decline again, even retreating into the 3,940 yuan range. At that time, a certain silver firm bought slightly on behalf of the Hong Kong firms, and the potential stabilized. It is estimated that a certain silver firm absorbed 30 taels from the money changers for 3,938 yuan, and then bought 20 taels from the spot firms for 3,940 yuan. The closing price last night was 60 yuan lower than the day before yesterday. It is heard that after the close, the spot gold firms absorbed dozens of taels from the money changers at a price of 3,938 yuan and 3,940 yuan. The price fluctuated by 90 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold firms' own gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot price, and the buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan. The spot standard gold was more than 10 yuan lower than the listed gold, and few transactions were made.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Changed to 400 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry was 405 yuan, but at noon it was reduced by 5 yuan. After that, there were no changes. As a result, Datong Bank changed the listed price to 400 yuan. The new banks had the same price as the old banks, and the buying price was reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Spot and Futures Slightly Diverged</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The trend of the black market for the British and American currencies seemed to have entered a normal and extremely stable state. There was no tension throughout the day. The results were loose, due to the continued selling by exporters and the weakness of buyers. The morning opened with a slight contraction in the British and American exchange rates. The British pound fell by 0.03125, while the American dollar remained unchanged. Later, a certain bank had a good appetite and the situation tightened slightly. However, due to the Hong Kong telegraphic transfer sale and the fact that a certain bank had more sales than purchases, coupled with HSBC's sudden desire to sell, although Chinese banks came to absorb it, the situation was still loose due to ample funds. The result was a closing price of 4 pence 6875 and 7 yuan 875, which was the loosest price of the day (equivalent to a British-American exchange rate of 4 yuan 0.03125). Compared with the day before yesterday, both the British and American currencies loosened by 0.0625. As for the potential of futures, because Chinese banks had opened up their appetite, everyone came to close out. However, foreign banks' intention to supply was weaker, causing the situation to diverge slightly. According to the evening close, the distance between the spot price and the October price was 0.03125 for the British pound and 0.0625 for the American dollar. The difference between the November price and the spot price was 0.09375 for the British pound and 0.1875 for the American dollar. Trading throughout the day was flat.</p>

Compared with the previous close, the British pound loosened by 0.03125, while the American dollar remained unchanged. This was due to the slight contraction of the exchange rate. After the opening, although Chinese banks sold slightly, a certain bank had a very good appetite, and the market trend slightly tightened. It is estimated that a certain bank absorbed spot British gold from Chinese banks, calling for 4 pence 65625. Later, the banks' selling price once asked for 4 pence 640625 for the British gold and 7 yuan 78125 for the American dollar. The HSBC listed prices were announced to remain unchanged, and the balance tax on silver was announced to be 0.015 yuan lower. After that, the Hong Kong telegraphic transfer came to sell, and both Yu Li and a certain bank had more supply than demand. It is heard that HSBC also sold out at that time. Although Chinese banks came to absorb it, the situation was difficult to handle. Yu Li sold spot British gold to Chinese banks and foreign banks such as Huabei for 4 pence 65625 and 6875. Then, Datong Bank and a certain bank sold spot American dollars to Chinese banks and foreign banks for 7 yuan 8125 and 84375.

<p>The market situation became more and more dull, and there were very few transactions. It is heard that exporters slightly sold spot British gold to foreign banks, calling for 4 pence 6875. Then, exporters and American banks, Datong Bank and a certain bank sold spot American dollars to Chinese banks and foreign banks for 7 yuan 875, so the situation continued to be slightly stronger.

<h3>Foreign Currency Falls Without Looking Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market became increasingly weak. The foreign exchange rate loosened and the gold price broke through the 4,000 yuan mark. The industry and outsiders were not encouraged. Money changers were unwilling to accept foreign currencies at high prices at their shops, to avoid losses. Those who held foreign currencies were uneasy. The market yesterday saw the British pound fall the most by 1.5 yuan, followed by the American pound falling by 1 yuan.

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Retreated, Foreign Debt Prices Declined Sharply, with British and French Debt Falling the Most by 10 Pounds</h3>
<p>The securities black market suddenly saw a reversal yesterday, with a sharp drop of 1 to 2 yuan. Because the government denied the rumor that Kohl was mediating the Sino-Japanese war, and the London prices of Chinese foreign debt suddenly fell sharply by 5 to 10 pounds, the bulls suddenly exited the market. There were still many buyers at the initial trading, but later there were few buyers, and the decline was also sharp. In addition, the old shorts had almost covered their positions, and the new shorts had little profit, so few covered their positions. The biggest drop was in Type A bonds. If the environment does not change much, it should fluctuate for a while. Yesterday, the selling pressure was extremely strong in the morning. No one cared about Type D bonds, which will be drawn soon. The rest were slightly weak at the initial trading. Then, because Yongkang, Tongkang, Wukang, Daqing, and general retail investors sold, although Tian Sheng, Song Mao, and other firms bought, there was more supply than demand, and the market price fell sharply. The situation stabilized slightly in the afternoon, but there was no sign of recovery. Yongkang still sold, and Tongkang slightly covered their positions. The market price fell by 1.25 to 2.05 yuan. The total trading volume was about 1 million. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 8.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the Public Exchange reported that, due to the opening of new trading in the afternoon, buyers came fiercely, and brokers worked hard to complete a large number of orders. In the short hour of the afternoon, there was almost no time to spare, so all brokers felt tired and exhausted. New high prices were discovered for Jardine Matheson shares, International Trust Company shares, Shanghai Silver Company shares, and Yangzi Silver Company shares. Even the various rubber shares that had been ignored for a long time gained a place in yesterday's rising trading. It is difficult to imagine whether the market can continue to maintain its current pace. Although there is current trading, it is backed by it is also important to pay attention to the , there are also many speculative buys, so it is also important to pay attention to any reaction.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Resumption of Stockpiling of 20s Count Lower Grade Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been declining for days, suddenly rebounded yesterday. This kind of recovery was expected and not surprising. However, although the actual demand situation was active, the buying volume from each firm was weak, so confidence was not greatly increased. Hong Kong firms absorbed nearly 100 bales of coarse yarn, but the demand for fine yarn remained stagnant. However, some wealthy firms believed that 20s count yarn selling for less than 650 yuan, was inexpensive since the profit margin for cotton fabrics mills were not that high, so the intention to stockpile reappeared.  The number of buyers increased slightly, and the market recovered again. After closing, the spot price of 20s count Double Horse yarn was 725 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning was mediocre and showed a scattered and weak image. The opening price continued to fall by 7 yuan. The spot price of Double Horse was 702 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 686 yuan. As for the coarse yarn, there was a slight demand from Hong Kong firms, and the market situation was stable. Soon after, there was good news, and the buying increased, rising slowly. However, a certain Feng firm has been selling every day recently. This firm has always had a large amount of stock, and it is unknown why they are selling now. The highest price of 20s count Double Horse was 725 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 705 yuan, an increase of 23 yuan over the opening spot price. It is estimated that 1,260 bales were traded in half a day. The market price of 20s count Double Horse rose by 13 yuan, Double Globe rose by 11 yuan, and Tiannv rose by 22 yuan. There were 55 pieces of export cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount bought by each firm is listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Factory Purchases Increase; Tonghua Cotton Sells Out Immediately</h3>
<p>Cotton transactions have greatly improved. Japanese factories are actively purchasing. Factories such as Inner-Outer, Nichihua, and Huadong have purchased approximately 3,000 bales of white-packaged, Tongzhou and Huoji cotton. Huachang Xinyu has purchased 2,000 bales of Huoji cotton. Given the growing demand from manufacturers, industry insiders are eager to procure even more. The white-packaged cotton business has seen a sudden surge. Although market prices were initially predicted to decline this morning, due to recent congestion at arrival points, factories took the opportunity to act, reversing the downward trend. A total of 5,521 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived from Subei and were completely bought up by industry peers and both domestic and foreign factories, leaving no surplus. Based on observations of the market situation, foreign factories are actively purchasing, and further large-scale purchases are expected. Therefore, market prices are similar to those of the previous day. Additionally, 315 bales of grass cotton were shipped to Hong Kong from the docks. The current cotton sales situation is listed below:</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have recently seen a sharp decline in prices due to the sharp appreciation of foreign exchange. Factories have been observing this for several days. Yesterday, the Qingdao group seized the opportunity to make some purchases, but the quantity was very small. There has been significant congestion of goods arriving in recent days, with supply exceeding demand, causing prices to plummet. Foreign cotton has been negatively affected as a result, with prices falling significantly.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market: The New York cotton market was quite firm in the morning. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai were positive, and market activity was brisk. There were also many industry players purchasing in the market. The practice of Southern groups selling short has also subsided. Spot trading has become more active, and the market has become more bullish. Closing prices rose by five to six points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market, including forecasts, rose sharply by more than five rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by more than ten points, and Liverpool cotton rose by nine pence.</p>
<h3>Grains: Abundant Arrival of New Japonica Rice</h3>
<p>Sales Prices Also Fell Sharply, Premium Native Rice Returns with Strength</p>
<p>Yesterday, various groups from downstream rivers arrived at South Port with a total of five to six thousand bags of Southern Port No. 2 and 3 and "Cartwheel" brand rice. Because the guest rice price reached the low end, most local merchants have purchased. The price of guest rice has increased by three to five corners. Other types, such as broken japonica and kiln-dried rice, as well as Baige and Luyang tip rice, remained stable due to similar supply and demand. New japonica rice arrivals were abundant, but demand was normal, causing prices to fall by half a yuan to one yuan. Specifically, Kai Changxi broken rice was priced at 32-33 yuan, middle grade at 30 yuan, and new japonica at 28-29 yuan. Suzhou Tongkun broken rice was priced at 30 yuan, and new japonica at 26-27 yuan. Qingjiao kiln-dried rice was priced at 29 yuan, Fengjia Baige at 27-28 yuan, Yang tip at 23 yuan, and lower grades at 21 yuan. Lu tip was priced at 23.5 yuan, and lower grades at 22 yuan. Jiangbei tip was priced at 18.1-2 yuan, and lower grades at 17.7 yuan. Wuhu special tip was priced at 19 yuan, and lower grades at 17.5 yuan. Broken tip was priced at 17 yuan, old grain at 31-32 yuan, and new grain at 26-27 yuan, also depreciated. Total market transactions amounted to more than 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>In other news, customer rice is still selling due to low prices. Domestic village groups and local shops, factories, and restaurants are taking advantage of low prices to buy, and transactions are becoming more and more lively. Scattered transactions totaled 6,400-500 bags. Although there are many stocks, shipments are also continuous. However, the current Shanghai price is only 17-18 yuan, broken rice is about 16 yuan, and brown rice is about 15 yuan. This price is no longer in line with the cost of production, and many new transactions by vendors have been halted. Major dealers and Japanese merchants are also unwilling to sell at low prices again. Therefore, after a smooth purchase by customers, the market immediately rebounded by two to three corners, which is the opposite of the sluggish and declining sales of japonica rice.</p>
<h3>Active Flour Sales</h3>
<p>The flour market continues to rise. Although the price of No. 2 flour from factories has not increased, the return of goods has gradually improved, mainly because of the continuous sales from both northern and southern customers, who inquire about small quantities. Cannon brand flour is especially favored by the Qingdao group, and it is on par with factory prices. Other brands of returned goods are also priced higher because there are fewer chips in the market, and warehouses are no longer in a hurry to sell. Total market transactions continued at more than 40,000 bags. Factory prices remained at 7 yuan, and Cannon brand and Red-Blue Fuxin brand prices were 6.95-9 yuan. Battleship brand was priced at 6.75-8 yuan. It is reported that the Japanese Phoenix brand flour has also increased at the same time, with the October price required to be 6.55-6 yuan.</p>
<p>The wheat market continues to tighten. Arrivals from various places have been weak in recent days, and production prices have not loosened. In addition, the flour market is firm, and sellers intend to call for higher prices. However, factory warehouses are not selling as smoothly as desired. Fufucorn and Fufeng factories sold 2,000 packages to Suzhou, Changshu, Changzhou, Yangzhou, Nanjing, etc., at a price of 9.86-6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises Sharply, then Retreats Slightly</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market has seen a scarcity of supply, with limited available chips on the table (approximately 1,000 barrels of barrelled oil and 2,000+ of boxed oil). Powerful warehouse owners are holding firm and refusing to sell. Generally, the market expects Kobe oil to reach a peak of 70 yuan. However, actual sales were sluggish yesterday, and market sentiment softened. Although prices fell by only two corners compared to the previous day, the overall trend remained more positive than negative. Yesterday, a total of 30 barrels of Kobe oil were sold at 60.8 yuan, 50 cases of Jiaozhou oil at 47.5 yuan, and 200 cans of Yantai canned oil at 63 yuan. Peanut oil also fell slightly by two corners. Hong Kong groups did not move. Only this street sold 200 cases of Jiaozhou oil at 57.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Beans and Sesame Shipped to South China</h3>
<p>Today, a total of 420 bags of beans and 600 bags of sesame were shipped to Hong Kong. A total of 2,100 bags of beans and 1,800 blocks of soybean cake were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Market Summary</h3>
<p>Large Bars Shrink, American and Indian Silver Continue to Rise: London, November 11 - Large bar silver retreated by 0.375 for the near term and sharply by 0.625 for the long term. The market was relatively stable. After the market closed, the metals market supplied enough for buyers' demand. Also, New York reported that the price of American silver continued to rise by 0.125. Additionally, Mumbai reported that Indian silver spot prices rose by 1 rupee 2 anna, and futures prices rose by 1 rupee 3 anna. 50 transaction orders were made.</p>
<p>Discount and Call Loan Rates Both See a Decrease: Yesterday, the discount rate for bank notes was as high as 57.5 yuan per thousand in the morning, but soon fell sharply to 52.5 yuan at noon. It remained stable in the afternoon, falling another 2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan rate of the Money Industry Association has returned to lower by three-tenths, calculated at 1.9 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<p>Sugar: Reportedly 2,000 Packages Have Arrived: Yesterday's sugar market was weak due to a relaxation in foreign exchange rates, declining sharply again. The price in the Sugar Association was 24.5 yuan less for current-month group goods, while the price for the book was 48 yuan. The initial price for foreign goods was 48.5 yuan, which tightened up slightly to 49 yuan later on, while transshipment goods were 37 to 37.25 yuan. Taikoo car white fell equally in price, B mark was 54 to 53.5 yuan, while the rest was lowered as well. H mark car red was 37 to 37.5 yuan and Dutch red was 38.5 yuan.

As the source increased, public confidence declined even more, resulting in no transactions at all. Unless the goods are sold smoothly, it will be difficult to make a wholesale opening for the time being. 600 packages of sugar arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<p>Shima and Tongan Longan Will Arrive Soon: Regarding Shima's new longan, it is said that a batch will arrive by Jinan ship today or tomorrow. However, because transportation is very difficult, the number will be small. It is also heard that Tongan goods will be transferred from Xiamen to Shanghai, with high costs. When the price is opened at that time, it may be difficult to return to the smaller price.</p>
<p>Indian Bituminous Coal is Still Firm: Although briquette coal has recently been allowed to extend, reducing costs, because there are few arrivals and strong sales, the market is still strong. 56,000 tons of Indian bituminous coal arrived last month, of which 30,000 tons were used by the power company, and the remaining two 20,000 tons were divided among the local industry players. Therefore, the owners are reluctant to sell easily. In the industry, lump coal is 108 yuan per ton, and retail from the store is 112 yuan per ton, 14 yuan per basket.</p>
<p>White Filature Decreased by 50 Yuan: The international silk market saw a turnaround yesterday with the US silk market. New York near-term rose by one point and deferred contracts up three and a half points while spot trade maintained firm. Prices in the local silk market fell due to continued appreciation of exchange rates. White Filature 7/8 grade opened yesterday at 4,200 yuan which has dropped 50 yuan, with 30 loads sold yesterday. Shantou Yellow Filature fine textured sold yesterday at 150 loads, with the price at 3,700 yuan, which were purchased by Jardine Matheson.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Great Victory in Northern Hunan, Chinese Troops Have Advanced to the Outskirts of Shanghai; Japanese Tanks Rushed to Qingpu to Engage; Chinese Regular Troops Active Near Hongqiao; Guerrilla Units in Pudong Preparing to Counterattack</h3>
<p>After weeks of fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops in Northern Hunan, Japanese casualties exceeded tens of thousands, forcing them to declare the abandonment of their attempt to occupy Changsha. Hearing this good news in the guerrilla areas of the Southeast, with the crisp autumn air and well-fed troops, they are sharpening their weapons to create further victories. Therefore, the Japanese troops between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, already exhausted, feel increasingly unable to cope. Meanwhile, the Chinese guerrilla units are in high spirits, their steadfastness matching the proud spirit of autumn chrysanthemums. Recently, Chinese regular troops have been pouring into the guerrilla areas, welcomed by millions of civilians with food and drink, their enthusiasm is extremely high. As a result, Chinese troops have become more active in the outskirts of Shanghai. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Regular Troops Arrive at the Outskirts of Shanghai</p>
<p>The sound of gunfire was very dense in the area east of Pudong on the morning of the previous day. Around 9:00 AM, Japanese tanks passed one after another westward through the Hongqiao Aerodrome. However, after the Japanese tanks headed to Qingpu, the sound of gunfire resumed south of Hongqiao Road. According to Shanghai locals, this was because Chinese regular troops had already arrived in the area and were taking action. In the afternoon, Japanese tanks and trucks full of infantry suddenly rushed east again.</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that after heavy gunfire was heard in the Qingpu area this morning (the 12th), Japanese tanks passed westward through the Hongqiao Aerodrome around 9:00 AM, returning only after more than two hours. It is not clear whether these tanks fired, but gunfire occurred near Hongqiao Village after each vehicle passed westward. This location is south of Hongqiao Road, several miles after where the tanks passed. It is said that the gunfire near Hongqiao Village was from Chinese regular troops. Shortly after noon, gunfire was again heard in the Qingpu area, and Japanese tanks and trucks carrying infantry rushed back to Qingpu Road.</p>
<p>Pudong Guerrilla Units to Counterattack</p>
<p>In the summer of the year, the Japanese army's "mopping-up" operation against the guerrilla units in the three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha in Pudong once forced them to retreat and gather in coastal areas, from Fengxian to Nanhui's Nicheng, reaching Chuansha along the Yiqin Public Embankment, forming a completely coastal area, separated by the embankment, creating a natural divide. The Japanese army was unable to advance, and the standoff continued to this day. After strengthening their equipment, the guerrilla units have taken a counteroffensive stance. According to locals, the guerrilla units have recently crossed this border line like a general offensive, with a large part of the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" defecting, impacting the situation. Currently, the guerrilla units in Fengxian have reached areas such as Yanfu Lane and the Taihe Japanese Bridge, while those in Nanhui have occupied Hengmian, recovered Lujiahui, and are close to Zhoupu. The northern half of Shangchuan Road up to Gaojiahang is controlled by the guerrilla units.</p>
<p>Situation Serious in Dinghai City</p>
<p>According to a recent traveler from Dinghai to Shanghai, after fierce fighting broke out outside the East Gate of Dinghai, a bomb suddenly exploded in front of the entrance of Tongshoutai Wine Shop (operated by Chen Er Mei, the "Chairman of the Autonomous Committee" of Dinghai) around 11:00 PM on the 29th of last month. The deafening sound shook the area far and wide. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese troops in the city immediately closed the city gates and prepared for strict defense, only sending a team to investigate the following morning. They found that the area of the bomb explosion was quite large, and the surrounding roads were also heavily damaged. Next to it were multiple colored leaflets from the "Youth Iron Blood Anti-Traitor Corps," with the content briefly stating a warning to those participating in certain organizations (hoping that they would turn back and repent). The "Chairman of the Autonomous Committee" Chen Sanmei issued a leaflet after the incident, explaining that he was forced to participate and requesting forgiveness. The "Vice-Chairman" Shen Songneng fled the city, and many others also left, causing a situation of extreme terror. In recent days, because Japanese soldiers fear attacks by guerrilla units, they have added artillery fortresses and strictly inspected residents entering and leaving, detaining anyone suspected, making the situation extremely serious.</p>
<h3>Cultural Figures Raise Money for Winter Clothing, Payment Methods</h3>
<p>Directly Send Payment to Collection Points by Recognized Individuals</p>
<p>The local cultural, educational, and student communities have been conducting their respective winter clothing donation drives since yesterday. The students in universities and middle schools responsible for this work are particularly dedicated, and their results are expected to be considerable. The original plan was to collect the raised funds by community, then pool and remit them to the general association. To reduce the collection procedures, a new method has been decided: recognized individuals can directly deliver the funds to the National Bank, the "Ta Kung Pao," or the "China Press," which can also collect the funds. If the amount is large, it is even better if the recognized individuals can directly remit it to the general association.</p>
<h3>No Anomalies in Area A North of the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Although the Japanese forced vaccination in Area A north of the Suzhou Creek has ended, there are still no restrictions on entering or leaving the area. At the same time, the Japanese have not implemented household registration checks for residents in the area. However, Japanese troops patrol each section of the area from time to time, and the inspection of passes at the barbed wire fence gaps at the end of North Jiangxi Road has become stricter than before. In addition, before the Japanese took over the defense of the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu Road, British troops had positions there. Since the Japanese took over the defense, the British troops' positions have been withdrawn, and the Japanese have not set up positions there either. Scavengers residing in Zhabei who do not have passes often steal withered branches and burnt wood they pick up from under the barbed wire fence and smuggle them into the concession for sale, causing frequent damage to the barbed wire fence. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a Japanese plainclothes soldier used a whip to beat the scavengers, and the unknowing scavengers still attempted to smuggle withered branches and burnt wood there, all suffering beatings from the Japanese soldiers and running away holding their heads. A newly posted sign prohibiting vehicles from passing has been affixed to the Japanese sentry box at the gap at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Wenjianshi Road, but bicycles are not included. At the gap at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, vehicles can freely enter and exit.</p>
<h3>American Chamber of Commerce Cables Washington, States Views on Neutrality Act, Hopes New Clauses Will Be Added Before Passage, American Ships Continue to Navigate to Far East Ports</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the American Chamber of Commerce in this city, fearing that the Pittman Neutrality Act amendment proposed by the American Senator would cause losses to American shipping to certain ports in the Far East if passed, telegraphed the US State Department in Washington yesterday (the 11th), stating the views of the American Chamber of Commerce on this matter. According to news obtained last night, the American Chamber of Commerce pointed out in the cable that if the Pittman bill is passed in its current form, the commercial interests of the United States in China and even other ports in the Far East will ultimately be severely harmed. The American Chamber of Commerce also expressed the views of American businessmen in this city, advocating that the Pittman bill should be modified to allow American ships to continue to navigate to ports in the Far East that belong to belligerent countries but are not actually in a war zone for a long time. No further news was obtained last night regarding the American Chamber of Commerce's action, but it was heard that the telegram sent to the US State Department had been approved by the entire American Chamber of Commerce in this city. According to the bill that has been submitted to the US Senate, the original plan is to restrict American ships from sailing to war zones. According to the provisions of the bill, the US President has the power to designate war zones that restrict American shipping. Although the general feeling is that the US President does not intend to designate the Pacific as a war zone, the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce believes that one should not take chances and should add new clauses before the bill is passed. If the Pacific regions are designated as war zones, Shanghai and Tianjin will also be among the cities that restrict American shipping, which is foreseeable. Therefore, the American Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the State Department yesterday, stating everything.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Claims Shanghai Has a Communist Organization, Falsely Accuses Concession Authorities of Being Deceived, Claims Soviet Union Organized Russian Emigrant Affairs Bureau, Both Concession Authorities Deny Existence of Such Organization</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" "discovered" that Shanghai has a Soviet "Communist organization" and that the police departments of the two concessions have been misled by the mysterious clouds of the organization. The "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" made a second attack yesterday, hyping up this non-existent threat.</p>
<p>Red Conspiracy Envelops White Russians</p>
<p>According to the newspaper, White Russian immigrants in Shanghai are now facing new threats due to the increase in Jewish immigrants. Moscow still pretends to promote the welfare of White Russians, but in reality, the red shadows of Moscow's conspiracy have enveloped Shanghai's 50,000 White Russians. This threat is in the name of the "Russian Emigrant Affairs Bureau," the name of which is the same as the agency established in "Manchukuo" and North China to take care of the affairs of White Russian immigrants. In reality, the "Russian Emigrant Affairs Bureau" is a "Soviet government outpost."</p>
<p>Preparing to Carry Out Communist Movement</p>
<p>The bureau was established after 11 members of the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai returned to Moscow at the end of last month, and the 11 people who returned to Moscow were the ones who planned to establish the bureau. The bureau aims to win the sympathy of anti-communist White Russians and carry out "other large-scale communist movements," such as political and economic espionage, etc.</p>
<p>Attempting to Ban White Russian Organizations</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" did not disclose the location of the headquarters of this "Red threat," but continued to state that the first step taken by the Russian Emigrant Affairs Bureau was to try to ban the White Russian Emigrant Association and the Ukrainian Emigrant Committee, which oppose the Soviet Union, and has requested the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Council of Directors of the French Concession to close the two organizations. However, neither the Municipal Council nor the Council of Directors has taken action. When reporters inquired with the Municipal Council and the Council of Directors yesterday, they learned that neither bureau was aware of the existence of this organization. Both bureaus firmly denied that any organization or individual had consulted with the two bureaus to ban the above-mentioned two White Russian emigrant organizations. According to the two bureaus, the number of 50,000 White Russian emigrants mentioned in the "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" is an exaggeration, as White Russian emigrants only number about half that amount.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Puppet Police Search, Find Nothing</h3>
<p>The actions of the Japanese puppets in the area of ​​roads built outside the boundary are unpredictable. Following the puppet police, there is also the emergence of so-called "special agents" and "Self-Defense Corps," making the situation more complicated. Residents are all confused and uneasy. After slogans and leaflets were discovered on National Day, the puppet police searched extensively, but found nothing. Yesterday, on Roberts Road, Caojiadu, Jessfield Road, Brenan Road, and the Zhaofeng Garden area, other slogans suddenly appeared on roadside poles.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Set Up Paper Mill in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Guanghua Paper Company Opens</p>
<p>Although the European war between Germany and Poland has come to an end, the various foreign goods in this city have not fallen in price. Even for newspapers alone, it still costs about 20 yuan per ream. Mr. Lin Shu'an, an overseas Chinese from the Philippines, recently recognized that there is a shortage of paper materials in Shanghai, and that paper prices are extremely high, affecting the printing and news industries greatly. He specially gathered more than 100,000 yuan to establish the Guanghua Chuanji Paper Manufacturing Joint Stock Company at No. 80 Jintai Lane, Singapore Road, in this city. It officially opened yesterday, with Mr. Yuan Ludeng unveiling the plaque. More than 100 guests, including Lin Kanghou and reporters from various newspapers, were present. The general managers of the factory, Lin Zaimou and Guo Zhenyuan, personally led them on a tour of the factories. The factory currently has more than 20 factory buildings, covering an area of ​​more than ten acres. Due to the initial startup, the factory currently produces only about 100 to 150 reams of paper per day, all of which are gray newsprint and wrapping paper. It will take some time to add equipment before they can also produce rough-edged paper, Lian Shi paper, and white newsprint, etc., so that the book and newspaper industries in Shanghai, where foreign exchange is scarce and foreign goods are in short supply, do not have to buy foreign goods at excessively high prices, thereby revitalizing domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador to China Discusses, Explains Belgian Position, Believes Belligerents Will Respect Neutrality, Refutes All Rumors of External Threats</h3>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Belgian Embassy in China, Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot recently made remarks to reporters from Belgian newspapers regarding the attitude taken by the Belgian government in the current situation, stating that Belgium firmly believes in the solemn promises made by the belligerents to respect Belgium's neutrality and reaffirming Belgium's determination to adhere to the commitments it has acceded to. The Prime Minister also urged journalists to pay attention to the soundness of Belgium's military and financial strength. Public opinion in Belgium, which was originally tense, has now greatly eased and expressed increased confidence in Belgium's neutrality. Belgian officialdom unanimously confirmed this trend and refuted all rumors of external threats.</p>

<h3>Japanese Restrict Portuguese Vessels from Changing Nationality, Japanese Consul Notifies Portuguese Consul Not Allowed to Change Ownership, but Says Sale to Chinese or Japanese Merchants Not Opposed</h3>
<p>Since April 8th of this year, more than a dozen Portuguese vessels belonging to the Mei Li Company (Metta), the Huamei Company (Tangbei, Tangqiao, Tanglu), the Zhengde Company (Lishi), the Atlantic Company (Hailong), the American Shipping Company (Fulu), and the diesel-powered splint ships Baode, Lude, and Fade, were illegally detained by the Japanese Navy at foreign merchant locations in eastern Zhejiang and at the Wusongkou, and were forced to moor at the Yangshupu river buoy. The former Portuguese Consul General to Shanghai, Alves, and the current Consul General, Melo, have repeatedly negotiated, but the Japanese have consistently made excuses and postponed the return of the vessels. During this period, personnel from the puppet "Ministry of Transport's Shipping Administration Bureau" approached the shipping merchants to persuade them, saying that as long as they registered with the "Bureau," the vessels would be returned. However, the Portuguese merchants ignored this, so the case has remained unresolved to this day.</p>
<p>Restricting Vessels from Changing Nationality</p>
<p>Reporters from Dagong News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Japanese detention of a large number of Portuguese vessels and a small number of German and Italian merchant ships is clearly aimed at coveting ownership and intending to buy them. Recently, some Portuguese merchants planned to sell their vessels to shippers of third countries because the vessels had been detained for a long time, the issue has not been resolved, and the losses are not small. However, the Japanese consulate expressed opposition to this, suddenly notifying the Portuguese consulate that the detained Portuguese vessels were not allowed to change ownership or nationality, but if they were sold to Japanese or Chinese merchants, there would be no objection. From this, the intentions of the Japanese are already very clear.</p>
<p>Deyao Intends to Return Vessel to Japanese Merchant</p>
<p>The Portuguese vessel Deyao, represented by the Italian Yihua Foreign Firm in this city, was loaded with goods from Beisha Qinglong Port on the morning of the 6th and was detained by the Japanese Maritime Military Police commanding the puppet police. Afterwards, the Japanese side sent workers to paint over the two characters "Deyao" of the ship's name. The company immediately reported the matter to the Portuguese consulate to inquire about the reason for the ship's detention in order to negotiate. According to reports yesterday from the Dagong News Agency reporters to the company, the cargo loaded on the Deyao vessel had been unloaded, and the ship's name had been repainted by the Japanese after they painted it over. However, there are still two Japanese on board guarding the ship.

<h3>National Construction Savings Certificates for Thrift - Issuance Imminent - Principal and Interest Fully Guaranteed - Redeemable After Six Months</h3>
<p>In order to encourage national savings and promote national construction, the National Government, after promulgating the National Construction Savings Certificate Regulations for Thrift last month, has instructed the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to prepare for issuance. More than 1,000 post offices in the Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang branch bureaus, and the Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi areas will uniformly sell these certificates. To ensure smooth implementation, the General Savings and Remittance Bureau has dispatched special commissioners to various regional branch bureaus to provide guidance and assistance. This savings certificate is superior and more convenient than ordinary savings, embodying the idea of saving to save the country. In addition to the direct responsibility of the postal service, the principal and interest are also guaranteed by the government, making it extremely secure. The savings certificates are divided into two types: Type A, which is registered and can be reported lost and reissued, and Type B, which is unregistered, cannot be reported lost, and can be freely transferred or gifted. The denominations are five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan, totaling six categories. The deposit period is set at a maximum of ten years, but Type A certificates can be redeemed at any time after six months at more than 1,000 post offices nationwide, making them similar to ordinary current savings, while the interest is far superior to that of current accounts. Type B savings certificates require specifying the storage period at the time of purchase. According to news from the local Savings and Remittance Bureau, these savings certificates will be issued soon. Based on the usual development of postal savings, it is predicted that this national construction savings program for thrift will receive widespread participation, which is extremely important for both personal savings and national construction.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Plummet for Days - Top Grade Rice Already Sold at Twenty-Nine Yuan - The Inevitable Trend of Soaring Prices Followed by a Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>New rice from rice-producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hunan is abundant and is being continuously shipped to Shanghai. New rice from Jing, Wu, and Jiangbei is still being transported. With the influx of new rice from all directions, buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude and dare not inquire. The market is flooded with spot goods, resulting in oversupply and sluggish sales. The rice market has been in a slump for days, with a series of sharp declines. The price of the best white rice had previously broken the 45 yuan mark but has now plummeted to 29 yuan. In the past two weeks, the price of the best white rice has seemed to fall by about 16 yuan. Currently, the supply is increasing, and the market sentiment remains bearish. The revised temporary trading rules for the rice shops tea party market, which were decided to be implemented from the 16th, were announced yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Rice stocks in Shanghai rice warehouses are gradually becoming abundant. The Bean and Rice Industry Association continues to send personnel to be responsible for the investigation, and to report weekly to the authorities of the two concessions and the seven rice industry groups for reference. According to the association's investigation, the rice stocks in various rice warehouses have doubled in the past week. Yesterday, a total of two boats from the Southern Port gang arrived at the river, and 5,000 to 6,000 bags were loaded from Kunshan, Tongli, Jiashan, Fengjing and other places. The market opened at 9:00 AM, with more than 8,000 bags of rice registered for sale. Sales were initially brisk but later turned sluggish. As a result, old rice and new japonica rice fell by one yuan, and the best white rice sold for 29 yuan. A total of more than 8,000 bags were sold in the morning. According to rice industry observers, the price of japonica rice and other goods will continue to fall within days.</p>
<p>Trading Rules - Announced and Implemented</p>
<p>The temporary trading rules for the Rice Shop Association Tea Party Market were revised and passed on November 2nd by a joint meeting of representatives of the seven rice industry groups. From now on, both buyers and sellers in the market must trade in spot goods and must not sell short in order to regulate the people's food supply and must not engage in irregular transactions. Yesterday, the market management committee notified the representatives of various shops and hotels and decided to implement the rules from the 16th of this month. The announcement of the Bean and Rice Industry Association is excerpted as follows: "It is hereby announced that the Association convened a joint meeting of rice industry groups on February 2nd and revised and passed the temporary trading rules of the Rice Shop Association Market according to the draft prepared by the Market Management Committee and decided to implement them from the 16th of this month.

<h3>Lace and Ramie Cloth - Request Exemption from Foreign Exchange Settlement for Shipment to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to request exemption from foreign exchange settlement for the shipment of lace and ramie cloth to Shanghai for sale: (1) Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing, according to the lace embroidery industry, lace is a handicraft industry of rural women, which should be promoted during the extraordinary period after the war to encourage production. Ordering the Zhejiang Customs to require foreign exchange settlement will inevitably increase costs, affect sales, and affect the livelihood of civilians in the rear. Please order the customs to exempt women-made lace from Xiaoshan from foreign exchange settlement for transportation and sale, which would be beneficial to the public. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows, Zhen. (2) Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing, Shen Kangxiang Company sold ramie cloth from Jiangxi to Shanghai. The Ministry approved a quota of 300,000 yuan for exemption from foreign exchange settlement. Now, there are more than 460 additional pieces, worth more than 25,000 yuan, but the Zhejiang Customs refuses to release them, citing the Ministry's order for foreign exchange settlement. The exemption from foreign exchange settlement has not exceeded the quota, but the government orders have changed suddenly, causing extreme distress to businesses. Sincerely imploring your departments to quickly issue an order to the Zhejiang Customs to release the goods without foreign exchange settlement according to the previous quota, I will be eternally grateful to the public. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows, Zhen.</p>

The interbank loan rate in the money market fell by 3 points yesterday to 19 points, which means that the daily interest rate per thousand yuan is 19 points.

Before the abolition of taels and the introduction of yuan, it was 70 qian, and it could not exceed this limit no matter how tight the market was.</p>

After the printing is completed, it will be transported to Shanghai and delivered to the bank for continued issuance. The style and paper are exactly the same as the first batch. The issuance method for the second batch will be improved, and various industries will entrust trade associations to distribute them to the public.

<p>Chen Zhanxiong, a Ningbo native, aged 44, owner of the Anle Palace Hotel and dance hall at the intersection of Sanyangjing Bridge on Edward Road, was found by the French police to have set up a couch in his shop for smoking opium.

<h3>Barber's Wife - Abducted and Forced into Prostitution - Fellow Townsman Reports for Extortion - Arrested by Police - Principal Culprit Apprehended and Awaiting Trial</h3>
<p>Jiang, the wife (20 years old) of Zhao Mingfu, a Yangzhou native (a barber), residing at 299 Xiaoshadu Road, is slightly beautiful. She has been married to Zhao for four years. Recently, because Zhao is in the autumn of high prices in the rice and pearl market, it is impossible to maintain expenses, so his wife Jiang had to go to a certain</p>
<p>Mansion as a Servant</p>
<p>In Yuyuan Road. However, she was young and ignorant of the dark secrets of Shanghai's bad people. On the 2nd of this month, she was lured by Chen Changgui, a fellow townsman and barber residing at 114 Beihe Road, Hongkou, who told her that a Japanese family at 41 Jingyang Lane, 74 Pei Er Road, wanted to hire a maid with a high salary and could go for an interview. She should not miss this opportunity. She believed him and happily went to the place with Chen. As soon as she entered the door, she could not escape. It turned out to be a place that was</p>
<p>A Brothel</p>
<p>Chen had already made arrangements with the brothel owner, received the money, and slipped away. Zhao Jiang was forced to sell herself by the madam of the brothel and began a life of misery. When Zhao Ming found that his wife had disappeared from the employer's home, he asked people to look for her everywhere, but there was no news. Until about 11:00 AM on the 11th, a fellow townsman,</p>
<p>A Barber</p>
<p>Named Zheng Ligen, came to his home and said, "I have found that your wife Jiang is staying somewhere in Hongkou. You need to pay 30 yuan and I can send her back."

<p>Kidnap Chen</p>
<p>Privately. Unexpectedly, Chen had gone out and had not returned home. The two Chinese detectives dared to sit in Chen's residence and wait for Chen to return home. At that time, the neighbors noticed that the two men were behaving strangely and reported to the police station by telephone. The police station initially suspected that it was a case of robbery and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in patrol cars to the scene and arrested the two men on the spot. They then dispatched detectives to</p>
<p>Wait for Chen at Chen's Home</p>
<p>Until about 11:00 AM yesterday morning, two more men came and claimed to be sent by the</p>
<p>Japanese Military Headquarters</p>
<p>To arrest Chen. The two men even admitted that they were currently the directors of a certain department of the headquarters. However, when they realized that the two men waiting were detectives from the police station, the two men ran away. A detective ordered them to stop, but they refused. A detective fired a warning shot into the air. The two men stopped and were arrested and taken to the police station.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of our clients, Venerable Yuehua, Abbot of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple, and Venerable Guanru (also known as Yangxi), Abbot of the Yu Huang Temple. According to them, yesterday's news section of your newspaper reported on a lost lawsuit over temple property, threats against lawyers, and that Gu Zhuxuan also received a threatening letter, leading to suspicion falling on Yangxi and others, resulting in their detention by the police and handwriting analysis, followed by release on bail. They claim that not only are these facts inaccurate, but your lawyer representative also sued Wu Boliang, a clerk from lawyer Zhu Qinong's office, and others for aiding the monk Qinliang, who bought temple property, impersonating detectives, illegally detaining monks and laypeople, and coercing them, filing charges of unlawful imprisonment, among other crimes. The lawsuit against lawyer Zhu and his associates for leading the invasion of the temple has not yet been added. Moreover, regarding the alleged threats against lawyers, they have never met Mr. Gu Zhuxuan and have no connection whatsoever. How could they drag in the philanthropist Mr. Gu out of hatred? Furthermore, the threatening letter was traced to 11 Jiangxi Road, and the name of Wu Boliang was not found in the letter. How could Wu Boliang lead detectives to the temple without asking the circumstances? After explaining the lawsuit to the police, they were allowed to return to the temple. Moreover, the board of directors of Leshan Temple and the affiliated Yu Huang Temple are still in litigation with the perpetrators Qinliang and Wu Boliang. How can it be said that they lost the lawsuit and made threats? This concerns their reputation. We believe that the reporter may have misheard the account. We request that your lawyer representative send a letter to your newspaper to publish a correction of the facts in the "Letters to the Editor" section. We would be grateful if your esteemed publication could publish the facts. We also extend our regards to the chief editor.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Liu Xiang, acting on behalf of,</p>
<p>October 7, Year 28</p>

<p>My younger sister recently got married, participating in a group wedding. Group weddings have become very fashionable in recent years, but the more realistic reason is to save money; most of those who participate in group weddings are probably "birds of a feather flocking together," right? The newspapers publish "During the National Crisis, Everything Should Be Simplified," but in reality, advertisements promoting the effect of "allowing the public to know" involve grand banquets at fancy restaurants with meals costing thirty yuan or more per table, and participants in group weddings are not included in that, are they?</p>
<p>However, in this way, the bride's right to sit in a bridal sedan chair is deprived. According to the customs of our village (Ningbo), the bridal sedan chair is originally regarded as extremely sacred. On the night before the auspicious day, the groom's family specially sets up a feast in front of the sedan chair to worship the sedan chair spirit when they “honor the ancestors” (always around 5 a.m.). Women are not allowed to touch the bridal sedan chair with their hands (it is said that women's hands are unclean, and washing them with scented soap won't get rid of it) to avoid angering the sedan chair spirit; if a woman accidentally steps over the sedan chair poles, it must be washed with sugar water, sincerely and fearfully; I don't know why the sedan chair spirit dislikes women so much, but the bridal sedan chair itself is specifically for women to ride in, and I don't know the contradiction between them. Moreover, I am even more confused as to why sugar water can dispel bad luck. I guess the sedan chair spirit probably likes to eat sugar, right?</p>
<p>Because the bridal sedan chair is so sacred and inviolable, the bride's marriage also takes riding in a bridal sedan chair as a matter of honor. The villagers' ability to pick on each other's weaknesses when quarreling is learned from the same master as Mr. Ah Q, so "the great-grandmother was carried in a bright red bridal sedan chair, the bridal sedan chair enters, the coffin exits, not like someone else's small green cloth sedan chair, a small boat..." has also become a magic weapon to defeat the enemy. When the other party hears the words "bridal sedan chair," even if they are not speechless, they are also awed. Therefore, to counterattack, either the same bridal sedan chair is used to flaunt one's status, or a new approach is taken, picking on other weaknesses to attack.</p>
<p>The use of the bridal sedan chair is very important, but getting actual enjoyment from it is not pleasant. The light is dim, the surroundings are tightly sealed, the air is not circulating, and to please the auspiciousness, you must also add a foot warmer with a fire in it, regardless of winter or summer. In addition to the phoenix coronet and embroidered cape, the bride's dress must also include a "grandmother's robe," and her face is covered with a red cloth "veil." That decoration is as bothersome as the "female hanging ghost" in the Mulian opera. I know too little about why there is such a strange dress; it is probably still related to the sedan chair spirit. Dressing up a bit ugly and covering the face is to avoid jealousy. During modern weddings, guests throw soybeans on the newlyweds (now it's changed to using red, green, and green confetti). It is said that the original intention is to dispel the ghosts who are jealous of the newlyweds. I never thought that the ghosts in China and foreign countries would be the same in this regard from ancient times to the present.</p>
<p>Although riding in a bridal sedan chair is not a pleasant thing, the brides in my hometown insist on being willing to taste this suffering. When the bridal sedan chair arrives in front of the hall, because it is not beautiful or new enough, some even rely on not being willing to get in the sedan chair. Of course, the solution is often that the parents and brothers personally promise to give more dowry. After getting in, those with weak bodies often vomit because of being smoked and bumped in this mobile dark room, and some even faint. Therefore, there are various guesses. Some say it is unclean and has offended the sedan chair spirit; some say it is bad luck and they are not blessed to enjoy it; the worst suspicion is that the bride had some unchaste behavior in her maiden's home, as if the sedan chair spirit is a full-time doctor specializing in examining the hymen. However, although the difficulties are numerous, they are willing to undergo this test. The only reason is that this is a "enjoyment" that only happens once in a lifetime. They say that even if you make millions, you can ride in cars and everything, but you can't ride in a bridal sedan chair again.</p>
<p>This reason may be correct, but because of the war, the authority of the sedan chair spirit has also declined. My younger sister's marriage without riding in a bridal sedan chair is an example.</p>
<p>However, without the progress of the war, the authority of the sedan chair spirit probably would not have declined so quickly, right? At least my younger sister would have wanted to ride in a bridal sedan chair, and the groom's family, to show face, would have had to let their new daughter-in-law "enter the door in a bridal sedan chair."</p>
<p>The anti-imperialist war actually includes the anti-feudal war. Resistance is nation-building. We should really thank the "warriors" who promoted the collapse of old China and the birth of new China.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16: Planning to Promote Medical Education and Establish Schools, Thinking of Expanding Village Governance and Entrusting Children with Something</h3>
<p>Now it's different. Although it is a village, it is like an enlarged home and a miniature country. Every year, there is a certain amount of income and expenses, and there are budgets and final accounts. For example, a country has state-owned property and state-run enterprises. Their village is the same. They have village-owned property and village-run enterprises. Don't underestimate this free village. At this moment, they are not like they were in the past, with all kinds of donations and additional taxes that never end, causing people headaches. So, where does their village income come from? Don't they also have to run many businesses? The central government and the provincial government cannot subsidize local funds. You have to prepare for it yourself. Their income comes first from land rent. Because since this war, there has been a big change in the land across the country. All land cannot be privately owned. The land in the free village is publicly owned by the free village. If villagers want to use that land, they have to rent it from the village, and they have to pay a certain amount of rent every year. This rent is certainly not the same. The rent in prosperous areas cannot be the same as the rent in remote areas. The rent is estimated according to the situation of the place. Although land cannot be bought or sold, and land seems to have no price, the amount of rent is equal to the price of the land. However, the value of land fluctuates indefinitely, and the rent also rises and falls accordingly. Therefore, the public has established a land valuation committee. No matter where the land is, it must be valued once a year. This valuation is not to estimate the selling price, but to estimate the rental price. For example, in the free village, the previous rented land used to generate a certain amount of rent per mu per year, but now it has risen a lot, and it is more than just a certain amount of rent. This is a matter of course. The price of land in the whole of China only increases year by year and will never fall. Especially in the villages of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and especially in the free villages in the villages of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Because there are really too many people in the big cities everywhere now, I am thinking of dispersing them. For example, in a place like Shanghai, the population is so large and crowded that it inevitably causes many dangers. Therefore, we must try our best to disperse them, and the route of dispersion is naturally always towards the nearby places. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces already have many cities, so they have gone to the villages everywhere. However, the villages are also different. Although the villages after the war are gradually developing, some have strict organizations, while others may not be well managed. It cannot be generalized, but like the free village, with Zhu Lao’s painstaking efforts in the past few years, even among the many villages between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it can be regarded as a modern model new village. 190</p>
<h3>Steamship (Anecdotes about Mechanical Poetry) Ru Hui</h3>
<p>The scholar from Qiongjiang wrote one of his fifty "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Poems":</p>
<p>The Wusong estuary is lined with teeth, Forts were built to defend the sea in those years,</p>
<p>Since trade has been opened, they have all been removed, The steamship lightly rides the waves.</p>
<p>After the opening of the sea ban, steamships followed, which attracted the attention of poets, who regarded them with great amazement, like gas lamps, electric wires, and telegrams. According to Wang Tao's "Ying Qiao Miscellany," such ships could travel sixty or seventy li per hour, but poets saw it as a kind of shrinking land. The old owner of twenty-three houses wrote:</p>
<p>The Zhongjiang River is good, the steamship is ingenious. Turning the mill is like a lantern horse, embarking is as fast as an arrow leaving the string, traveling ten thousand miles is convenient.</p>
<p>He compared it to a "lantern horse" and an "arrow leaving the string," showing his astonishment. Due to this astonishment, poets inevitably thought of the relationship between the sexes. Therefore, the owner of the Wanxiang Li Mengshi wrote one of his four "North Shanghai Little Bamboo Branch Poems":</p>
<p>The return date is in early spring, but cool autumn has not yet arrived,</p>
<p>Looking at the steamship every morning, I want to send a letter of longing.</p>
<p>Calling it a "steamship" is very inappropriate, but at the time, there was no word "steamship." Wang Zhichun's "Lun Chuan Chu Yang" poem recorded in Volume 1 of "Tan Ying Lu" said it more scientifically:</p>
<p>Lightning strikes and thunder roars incessantly, The warship goes straight east with the water.</p>
<p>The silver waves break through, the wind howls like a horse, the iron armor seems to fly, the stars offend the bull.</p>
<p>The atmosphere rotates the wheel axis, the fox smoke sways, the sea and sky are autumnal,</p>
<p>The building ship was originally our thing, I will try another trip to the Stone City.</p>
<p>The middle two couplets are truly masterpieces. In addition, Wang Tao mentioned "warships" in his article on "steamships," but at the time, very few poets used "warships" in their poems, perhaps because sea battles had not yet occurred at that time, while "steamships" were closer to people's lives at the time. The only one I have seen is a chapter of "Military Song," which is found in the "Middle School Song Collection" written by Xin Han. The song says··</p>
<p>A central order shakes the mountains, the sea department has heavy military power. The general's flags are like clouds, and the warships surge forward. The gun positions are cold on the left and right sides, and the electric sound is loud. The searchlights are red at night, and the four countries are shocked by the power. The South China Sea and the Bohai Sea are linked together, and the diplomacy is smooth. Establish prestige and protect the country, and the boys are ambitious, the Pacific Ocean, is in trouble, brave the waves and wait for the time, the military officials do not hesitate to die! (1)</p>
<p>It is a pity that the whole army was defeated that day. When will this shame be erased? The navy is weak and it is difficult to defend the country, and other races bully urgently. The new Panama of America, the situation requires people to cut. Think of the oyster and bird fighting for dependence, how can you sit back and lose the fisherman's profit? The old empires are finally rising up, and the sea power is restoring the national prestige, and Jiang You is becoming more and more energetic! (2)</p>
<p>However, this was also written after the defeat of Japan in the Sino-Japanese War in 1894-95. "The Pacific Ocean is in trouble," decades ago, the Pacific Ocean was full of crises, but I never thought that decades later, its tense situation has not eased a bit. As for the shame of the whole army's failure, the day of washing it away is near, because in this war, our country will eventually be on the victorious side.</p>
<p>A Path to Self-Destruction</p>
<p>The soaring prices in Shanghai, and the hoarding by speculators, are of course the biggest reasons, especially after the outbreak of the war in Europe. However, the opportunistic profiteering of ordinary merchants and the blindly raising prices is also a reason. This abnormal development, although it can profit for a while by relying on the special circumstances of the "isolated island," in reality, what will happen to the war in Europe, and whether the general residents can bear such a heavy burden, recent facts have clearly broken the wishful thinking of those speculators and blind merchants.</p>
<p>For example, a certain company's advertisement warned customers to ship their goods immediately because the flour was rotten. From this advertisement, we can clearly understand how cruel those speculative merchants are. When the price of rice soared and residents used flour as a substitute, they hoarded a large amount of flour, and as a result, the price of flour gradually rose. But now that the new grains are on the market, the source is smooth, and the price of rice has fallen to about 30 yuan, and high-quality rice is sold for 18 yuan, those who hoard foreign goods are also losing money. —This is really the best lesson for speculators!</p>
<p>As for ordinary merchants, they also raised their prices under the pretext of foreign exchange and sources, but those goods even have nothing to do with foreign exchange and sources. In addition to being exploited by this general purchase (and trying their best to save money), other savings have been saved, and they really cannot afford to increase the burden. Therefore, increasing prices is indeed the freedom of merchants, and those who are directly affected are also themselves—that is, the sales of all goods have plummeted. The lesson of this fact also made them realize that all speculation and tricks are a path to self-destruction.</p>
<p>In the call to promote the reorganization of commercial ethics, I hope that merchants will look further ahead, and there should be a limit to making profits. Even if everyone is heartless and doesn't talk about "commercial ethics," the "plummeting sales" is the best ironclad proof of hitting oneself in the foot! (Tianwen)</p>

<h3>The Private Life of Mei Lanfang (1) Li Feishu, Miscellaneous Memories from the American Border, No. 6</h3>
<p>Drama emphasizes the "Three Unities," and I, a humble writer, also have my "Three Unities." First: if I don't attend a gathering, I don't write; second: if my leather trunk isn't empty, I don't write; third: if I don't get close to women, I don't write. If I attend a gathering, then I can write a thousand words, ready at a moment's notice. If my leather trunk is empty, then my wife and children are crying for food, waiting for rice to be cooked, making me unable to bear not to write, to exchange writing for money and rice. If I get close to women, then my whole body feels relieved, and my mind is exceptionally clear, the effect of which is no less than that of "red bean lanterns and rice flower."</p>
<p>If I hadn't attended the gathering and received the manuscript fee, and if my yellow-faced wife hadn't fallen slightly ill, then, because of this, "Miscellaneous Memories from the American Border" would have died young! I trouble the editor to make a special trip, probably to urge me to write. Even if it's not to urge me to write, I would still say it is. Because, in the minds of us poor writers, the editor holds the power of selection and rejection, and their position is as lofty as that of the examiners in the imperial examinations of the past. Although it is an ordinary visit, I can use it to emphasize my own importance. Saying that he came to urge me to write can invisibly increase the value of my articles. Don't you see, "Following Premier Sun Yat-sen for many years" and "My friend Hu Shi," these two simple sentences have made many revolutionary heroes and literary giants!</p>
<p>My "Three Unities" have expired. Moreover, I am especially favored by the editor, so I urgently write this to repay their kindness.</p>
<p>The topic and outline had already been prepared for two articles. One is a collection of travel impressions from Japan. It just so happens that my teachers and friends warned me to be careful when writing articles! Don't speak carelessly, and don't get involved in any political suspicions. However, they think too highly of me! How am I worthy to talk about politics? However, living in this turbulent world, especially on an isolated island, it is better to be cautious when writing! Didn't Mr. Zhu Xinggong "fail to live up to his youthful head"? Forgive me for being a coward. I still want to keep these eyes and this mouth. My mouth is waiting to taste what a hundred yuan of rice per picul tastes like? My eyes are kept to see what kind of drama is being performed on the world stage? Just like what Dongfang Shuo said at Hongni Pass: "Who knows which family is stronger?"</p>
<p>Many friends, after seeing my "Miscellaneous Memories of Mei," hope that I can write about Mr. Mei's private life. Indeed, people who are with Mr. Mei every day feel that everything about him is very ordinary. However, in the minds of many outsiders, they wonder how mysterious his life is! It is rumored that he eats forty or fifty yuan worth of pearl powder every day. Some even say that he has a dozen bodyguards at home. Such claims are too bizarre! So I take this opportunity to write this article, "The Private Life of Mei Lanfang," to correct the rumors in society, which I think is what the readers of this publication need. However, I must first state that although I am his student and private secretary, I have my own position, and I will never dare to flatter my employer. This article adheres to the principle of recording everything I have heard, in order to be truthful.</p>

<h3>The Only Surviving Talent of Old Female Roles Li Duokui's Impression By Bingjiu</h3>
<p>Li Duokui's coming to the south this time is a great opportunity for those who love to listen to old female role operas. In the old female role opera world, since Kui Yunfu passed away, the only successors have been Layman Woyun and Li Duokui. Layman Woyun is weak and has been retired for a long time, so today, when talking about the authentic old female role, it is really only Duokui. This time, the addition of Duokui to the Xin Xin Ping troupe has strengthened the lineup significantly. The writer has a special love for this art, and since the opening of Xin Xin Ping, I have watched his "Diao Jin Gui," "You Liu Dian," "Mulan Saves Her Mother," and other plays no less than four or five times. His voice and rhyme are still good, and his spirit remains the same. Every time his singing comes out, the mundane dust disappears. The accompanists' skillful backing further enhances the performance like green leaves.</p>
<p>Duokui initially learned from Binsheng and was unknown. Fu Caoxian has been playing the huqin for many years and knows what people admire, so he taught everything he knew to Li. Later, when Li performed, Fu played the huqin for him, making them a perfect combination of the flower and the green leaf. Duokui, being a direct disciple of Yunfu, has deeply understood the essence of the Kui school. His singing is gentle and roundabout, his dialogue is proper and quiet, and his tone is clear and bright. He has captured Yunfu's lingering and feminine strengths, but his voice is slightly inferior to the past. When raising his voice, he tries hard to make it sound good, but it seems to lose its smoothness. When singing low, there is plenty of gentleness and roundaboutness, but not enough vigor and simplicity. Although both have the beauty of twists and turns, they lack the taste of highs and lows and lingering sounds. This is because his study of Kui has not reached the end. Fortunately, he does not slack off in every performance, and he uses all his strength in every word and sentence, thoroughly and happily, without being afraid of being too intense. I especially love the sob and sorrow in his counter-melodies, which makes people yearn for it. His spoken dialogue is always light and crisp, losing its heavy and turbid quality. Sometimes it is overdone, neglecting the accuracy of the sounds. He is too restrained in his articulation, making it unpleasant to listen to, and he mistakenly uses the tip of his tongue. This cannot be avoided in every play, which is a common problem with Kui Yunfu. His appearance is dignified and has a noble air, which is most suitable for the identity of a titled woman. His manner and movements lack graceful charm, only focusing on being unrestrained and generous, which is also not suitable. His stage steps and sleeve movements are just like Ma Fulu's cross-dressing, which is too careless. The old female role's hand gestures, eye movements, posture, and steps should all match the four words "old and majestic," which is not just about the appearance and dialogue. In the past, when Kui Yunfu performed "Visiting the Cold Prison," when entering and leaving the prison door, his sleeves danced gracefully, and his style was enough to overwhelm the young female role. At that time, ordinary people criticized him for losing the identity of Lady Wang, so they ridiculed him as a "flower old female role." In fact, the old female role should have some of the young female role's style, graceful posture, and masculine beauty. This is the true evaluation of the old female role's posture, but it is important to avoid going too far, and the performer should understand this himself.</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction: The Wild Girl By Qihua</p>
<p>"The Girl From Mexico"</p>
<p>The script of "The Wild Girl" can be said to be completely written for Lupita Tovar, who has not been on the screen for a long time. However, Lupita Tovar's Mexican girl is only outwardly wild and naughty, and she cannot grasp the character of a tropical girl who likes to play pranks more deeply. Therefore, in several scenes, her overly exaggerated behavior is close to being comical.</p>
<p>Donald Woods plays the comfortable Matt very well, and his movements and expressions are suitable for this type of clueless character.</p>
<p>The director's skills are not very good. He simply introduces a story in a straightforward way. At the very least, the process of Lupita Tovar secretly loving Donald Woods is not obvious enough, so that the climax of Donald Woods being sleepless all night and rushing to Romeo's villa lacks power.</p>
<p>Behind the Curtain of Peach Blossoms By Qihua</p>
<p>"Man About Town"</p>
<p>Someone once said that American movies are mostly "fancy cakes." Then, "Behind the Curtain of Peach Blossoms" is naturally a delicate "fancy cake." Let's take a look at its story first: Lady Arlington and Lady Bob both feel that their husbands are too busy managing their finances and neglect their duties to their wives, so they devise a plan to pretend to be intimate with Bob, an opera manager, in order to arouse their husbands' jealousy. This script unfolds a farcical comedy on the theme of Hollywood's "new art of husband management."</p>
<p>The entire film is built on "coincidences." For example, when Bob and others are talking about Lady Arlington in the train, Lord Arlington is sitting opposite them: Arlington and Lady Bob see Bob and the other's wife being intimate in the window and secretly laugh at each other, etc. In terms of both emotion and reason, even the romance between Bob and Diana (Dolores del Rio) is inexplicably forced together.</p>
<p>The interspersed song and dance scenes at the end are quite grand, especially the beauty of the photography, such as the "close-ups" of each black gauze face and the "stamp method" of the black skirt dance, are very novel and beautiful.</p>
<p>OuYang YuQian Heads to Guilin to Preside Over the Drama Academy</p>
<p>According to the members of the "China Art" troupe who came to Shanghai, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, the supporter of the troupe, has left Hong Kong for Guilin to take the position of president of the Guilin Provincial Drama and Music Academy at the invitation of the local authorities. Ouyang's trip to Guilin is due to two reasons. Firstly, "China Art" has been dissolved in effect, and some of the troupe members have left Hong Kong, most of whom have come to Shanghai. Secondly, Ouyang is enthusiastic about drama and does not want it to end with the dissolution of "China Art." He has long planned to return to the mainland to continue his work. He immediately set off upon receiving the invitation from the Guilin authorities. He has now arrived in Guilin, and it is expected that the Guilin drama scene will have a new look in a few days.</p>
<p>JinZai Charity Performance. Jinzai has been a disaster zone for over a month with land of refugees that need urgent aid. There are rumors that the notable philanthropists of Shanghai are organizing a performance to raise money, the location has been set at the Gold Grand Theater.The date is set after Song Dezhu's full term has ended, with a performance spanning two days, with participants including all notable actors from the Gold Theater, in addition to Zhang Eyun who has agreed to perform.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Chronicles of the Pear Garden: Xu Muyun's Record of the Righteousness of the Three Lius</h3>
<p>Liu Gansan's name is well-known to those familiar with opera. His performance of riding a real donkey onto the stage in "Visiting Relatives" is enough to show his unconventional behavior. In the lyrics of the play, he often composed new lyrics to satirize current politics, which made the general princes and ministers fearful of him. Because the politics of the late Qing Dynasty were extremely corrupt, Liu was motivated by righteous indignation and ignored the consequences, cursing the powerful. Therefore, he was deeply hated by them, and he was imprisoned countless times. In his later years, he was elected as the head of the Jingzhong Temple, so he did not often appear on stage. During the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, when Gansan was over eighty years old, someone saw him reappear on the stage. He used the position of the character he played to satirize Li Hongzhang's shameful defeat and cession of land in a joking manner. His fearless spirit, as if there was no one else around, moved the audience at the time. Unexpectedly, the sons and nephews of HeFei happened to be in the audience. They were so angry that they arrested him and imprisoned him. It is said that Gansan eventually died in prison. He was so old that he neither clung to life and feared death nor was attached to his position as the head of the temple. Instead, he appeared in person to oppose the powerful. People say that Gansan was truly a righteous and eccentric man of ancient times, hidden among the actors. Liu Xikui was extremely beautiful, but she was as beautiful as peach blossoms and as cold as ice and frost. In the early years of the Republic of China, she came to the capital from Tianjin. Famous scholars such as Yi Binfu and military men such as the Deputy Chief of Staff Lu Jin all flocked to her and strongly supported her. At that time, Cui Chengchi, an subordinate of Lu, was especially fond of Liu. As a result, Cui and Liu became husband and wife. When Lu Jin heard about this, he was very jealous and immediately dismissed Cui from his position as the head of the Second Department. However, Cui did not care about being dismissed because he had won the beauty. (118)</p>
