<p>社評</p>
<h3>儲糧問題</h3>
<p>自夏秋交，米價越限再升至四十餘元，今雖秋收畢登，而猶盤旋於三十餘元，出新時之米價如此，至來日靑黃不接時將奈何！為民食未來計，市民聯合會向租界當局建議儲米所由來也。</p>
<p>夫米價曷為而貴，為歉收乎？則川湘皆告豐稔，豈獨歉於長江下遊產米之巨區。為風災乎？則如浙西遲稻，容或秀而不實，若早稻並不受其影響，收穫如常。是則米價之貴，非關於產額之歉收，而由於人力之把持。蓋自日軍侵華，豈有萬里裏糧以相從乎？中國民食本患不給，平添此數十百萬人之食用，且寄食不足，復起攘奪，凡農產之品，不論其為衣為食，苟可用以弋利者，無不用統制之名，行獨占其實，節節阻撓，重重留難，橫征暴歛，苛細如毛。故同是米也，遊擊區之米價恒賤，淪陷區之米價獨高。甚至如福山港發搶阻止米自帆船搬上德輸以運滬，又如蔬菜船迫令靠虹口方面碼頭相上下，以及米麥到源之稀少，無一而非加重上海民食方面之負擔。且聞米糧之囤積於虹口者，數量甚鉅，故市塲而有日商賣出，則行市立平，此其米何自而來乎？非中國之米耶！在中國人民，產米者不得保有其米，待米而食者，因米貴而淪於餓鄕，露宿風餐，流離載道，卽在上海馬路上猶得隨時隨地見之，非所謂倉有朽粟而道有餓莩者歟！加以甘為虎倀，揚波助瀾，囤積居奇，不顧民艱，故人為之障礙一日不撤除，則米價一日不平，明於此，上海人士欲期生活之安定，固非目前環境所許也。</p>
<p>「積錢防老，積穀防荒」平時尙如此，况在石米值錢百餘千之今日。上海能儲有大量之米，用以調節盈虛，平準糧價，不僅於民食有益，亦與農民有利，故常平之制所以為世稱道者在此。惟今所欲舉辦者，擬乘新穀登塲，購儲米糧，備異日接濟民食之用，固與常平之制有間，而其調劑平準之意則一。上海糧市所以不易收管理之效而商人敢於居奇操縱者，正為公家徒知限價之為政，不知為民食預作準備耳！有所備，則如今秋米價越限飛漲之際，出其所儲，平準糧價，源源供給，人心安定，米商雖欲居奇而不得，雖欲罷運而不敢，米價縱不能抑低如平時，亦不至高貴如今日，是知積儲之不可少。然一念積儲為中國歡千年來荒政之要務，而終鮮成效者，非為法之不善，而為技術設備方面，多所欠缺，遂使善政成為秕政；今雖內地積極提倡，猶在試辦之中。若上海此决儲糧，能否實現，尙待兩租界方面之決定，卽使成為事實，則一切技術問題，固當讓諸專家之設計，而犖犖大端引為預慮者，不妨一商榷之。</p>
<p>儲糧不問糧石之多寡，要必有其經費，以上海而論，所存儲者預備全市民衆一月之糧，抑兩月三月之糧乎？糧之為數未定，則經費無從計，然必知其為數匪細，蓋以上海市民之衆多也。如是則款將安出？兩租界當局有無類於積穀防荒一類基金之儲存？若無此基金，而欲舉辦儲糧，勢必臨時募集經費，費時失機，又不知觀成於何日。吾則向銀錢業舉借，款雖可得，決不能以事觸公益，而借款全部可以免息，則利息所費間接亦所以增加米糧之成本也，此其一。採辦儲糧，要須不使本地米糧蒙受漲價之影響。蓋有所辦，人亦有所求，故在本地辦糧存儲，端在利用時機而善運用之，不然，卽將為人所利用矣。若向產地採辦，依目前情勢，諸多扦格；軍國外洋米，自歐戰作，在局勢未分明前，暫時或無輸出之望。故採辦地點時機亦應考量，此其二。儲糧要有倉庫，上海尙無公厫之設置，故須存於商業倉庫，而一般倉庫就嚴格言，是吾宜於儲糧之用，姑不論，而棧租所費，固絲毫不能省也。此其三。存米乎？存穀乎？亦歷來言積儲之一大問題也。米易紅朽，故古時盛儲穀。卽如上海人夏令食米，多用破礱，破礱卽陳穀新春也。儲穀則所占之倉庫地位大，似非上海所宜；儲米則以身骨本潮軟，又往往為攙水作偽之故，易於變質；故如何而求共適當，此其四。何况米若久藏；霉蒸蟲蛀，必有所蝕；出糶之際，升合折耗，在所難免，故不以牟利為目的，則損耗之應如何籌補，此其五。凡此所云，若儲米果得成為事實，亦不過增加成本，卽使轉嫁於消費者，較之米商操縱而生之損害為輕。惟公家如一時難集鉅款，儲米一時不得實現，雖目前新米畢登，米價或尚有稍落之可又惟恐米價之不高，故戰時糧食，常行管理，卽所以防杜投機危及民生，雖與戰區無直接影響而有間接關係，如香港等英屬地，亦莫不採行管理制，防微杜漸，蓋有不可疏忽者矣。今上海究未脫戰時狀態，擁有數百萬之人口，四周產米奧區，又遭淪陷，民食調節，倍形困難，租界當局除一度施行其消極的限價辦法之外尚無進一步之措施，此後宜採取更積極更有效之行動，以安定上海全市之民生，亦所以維持上海之治安也。</p>
<p>雖然，民食前途之隱憂尙深，蓋日政府為謀來年食糧豐足計，決議輸入外米，現正籌備此事，並云日政府已六年未運外米至日，聞該計畫之第一批事務，業巳辦竣，此本月一日路透社之東京電訊也。日本何以六年來不輸入外米，而獨於今後亟謀輸入者，此其用意所在，正為日本遣派大批軍隊侵華之後果，有如威爾斯未來世界預言所云，日本因「戰爭使國內田畝荒蕪，到處成為饑荒，」加以本年颶風常臨，農作損壞，自在意中，勢不得不仰給於國外，此其一。再則日美商的轉瞬期滿，太平洋風雲之為睛為雨，日人雖有事大之心，曲意承歡於美國，亦不能確有和洽之把握，三島孤懸海中，封鎖堪虞，不得不預事儲糧，以防萬一，此其二。本來日本米糧之取給，一則取諸屬地，如朝鮮台灣之米產，向為日人所予取予求者也。鮮人之所產，鮮人常不得享用之，鮮民無所食，轉而求諸東三省之小米紅糧以分中國人之所食。再則所謂外米者自指蘭貢西貢等地之米而言也。以目前日本之財力，缺乏外匯，決無能力購儲大宗之外米。卽使以物易物，而自歐戰發生，各國屬地限制外貨輸入甚嚴，日本欲有所獲，亦必有限。然則將自何地以輸入大宗外米乎？曰中國。蓋自華軍西撤以還，南北之粳，蕪湖之秈，為日人所綑載以去者，數量雖無從統計，要知其必甚鉅。今夏以來，變本加厲，彼有需要，則禁止出運；彼無所需，始行弛禁，而勒索如常。故中國米產原供中國人之所食，今則僅佔日人之餘瀝耳。嗣後日人加緊實行其外米輸入政策，中國民食，更將不堪設想，蓋予取予求，又惟中國是求耳！果如是，中國人民苟有求存之決心，則積儲之不論為公為私，固應早為之備。卽行商客販，亦宜激發天良，弗再以民食為投機暴富之工具，母任米糧一去不復返，若必待去餓鬼之道不遠，而始悔悟，噬臍無及矣。</p>

<h3>金融　國外資金源流入　外滙頭寸益見充牣</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美滙暗市、繼續向鬆途邁進、直破上月三十日先令五辦士三四三七五紀録、而創五辦士三五三七五最近新鬆價、蓋頭寸充盈、與往昔截然不同、法幣信用之鞏固、亦已深入投機者之腦海、咸知現時收藏外滙、斷非牟利之圖、反之、時願早日乘機了結、是以鬆勢不易回頭、而其中拋塞來源、外電佔其多數、顯示國內金融穩定、故資金復向上海流入、論今日賣買情况、首以港帮美行與日行等競相塞出、即鬆達五辦士三一二五及八元八七五、嗣以匯豐肯吸、及紗花帮與洋行等扒進、（一說結進美金十五萬元）、回至五辦士二五及八元七五、迄至午後、扒者絕跡、賣風復熾、直硬達英金五辦士三五九三七五、美匯八元九三七五、後以日行及各大洋行乘機猛扒、價始略軟、收盤結果、英金仍爲五辦士三四三七五、美匯爲八元九〇六二五、較之上日、英鬆一二五、美硬二一八七五、至期貨情勢、與現貨相仿、全天現期交易尚旺、</p>
<p>洋行中途有結款</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期縮一八七五、遠期跌〇六二五、紐的銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英等對美·對法均平、對滬長〇六二五、美對英降二五、對滬升二角、對法大一二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辦士一一八七五、美匯八元六八七五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後港電與日銀行界競相塞出、且美行大通亦懷賣意、加之其他外行吃胃亦淡、是以市勢步硬、計港電與日行及大通等售予有利麥加利等外行現貨英金五辦士二五、及現貨美匯八元七五、匯豐掛脾揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小一分、此後港電又來吐予匯豐現貨英金五辦士三一二五、同時美匯亦硬至八元八七五、旋以匯豐續有吃胃、加之投機商、如紗花帮等突來扒進、一度回平、英金會軟至五辦士二五、及美匯亦縮達八元七五、且以上均爲外行買進價、但不久港電與日行復來塞出、兼華比及某行等亦粉來拋售、加以滙豐中止扒吸、而其他更鮮納胃、故爲狀復趨鬆硬、午刻英金竟長至五辦士三七五、美匯幾達九元新關、爲八元九三七五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五辦士三一二五、美匯八元八七五、比晨開英鬆〇九三七五、美硬一八七五、</p>
<p>美金幾達九元關</p>
<p>後市外電與美行繼續吐出、並出口商亦來拋塞、故市勢續告步硬、計外電售予麥加利現貨英金五辦士三四三七五、同時某行吐予正金現貨美匯八元九〇六二五及九三七五、後英金最硬曾喊過五辦士三五九三七五、入後進口洋行如德士古美孚等趁賤大量扒結、但外行供意尚佳、致市象僅稍轉軟、英金至五辦士三一二五、美匯達八元八七五、迨至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金又硬至五辦士三四三七五、美匯復鬆達八元九〇六二五、本月份英金五辦士三二八一二五、美匯八元八七五、結果比上日、現期英均鬆一二五、美俱硬二一八七五、</p>
<p>香港申匯降八元</p>
<p>香港三日電、今晨匯市開盤平平、英美日各匯不動、申匯現貨降四元、爲二百八十四元、十時二十五分、申匯現貨續降二元、為二百八十二元、十一時三十分平穩無變動、十一時三十九分、申匯現貨再降二元、爲二百八十元、下午二時至三十分開盤平穩不動、</p>
<p>天津英美匯價鬆</p>
<p>天津三日電、今晨匯市晨開見硬、英匯現貨鬆二一八七五、爲五便士二一八七五、美匯現貨放長四三七五、爲八元六八七五、申匯降二元、爲一百元平匯、「聯鈔」暗盤賤七角五分、爲九十四元二角五分、</p>
<p>英美金鎊再降一元</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、因外匯鬆濫、有增無减、烚赤疲莫能興、英美金鎊供給頗盛、金票亦不乏拋塞、市况甚鬆、晨間英金票爲四十一元二角、美金票爲十一元四角六分、自後步趨下游、晚間英金蔡降至四十元零五角、美金票降至十一元四角二分爲最弱、香港·法郎·荷蘭·安南等票、供求俱暢、市價維持穩定、坎拿大票需要見增、供給稀少、獨呈堅秀上升、日金票需要頗盛、市况盤旋帶堅、晚市爲一元三角一分、朝鮮票供求未盛、市况穩定、晚市仍爲一元一角、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱降一元、英金票降七角、美金票降一角八分、坎拿大票升二角、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>黃金未見狂跌　港帮一味扒吸　售者猶豫不決</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、捉摸不定、雖外滙頻鬆不巳、豈知結果祇略撳二十餘元、故外滙若稍有回頭、買風自必大起、今察人心似已轉好、除港帮一貫扒進外、本地帮亦買不少、且售者猶豫不決、供求尚能敷衍、晨開爲三千六百三十元、較隔日小十四元、此因滙市報鬆、繼有證券帮及金號代客購入、立升達三千六百五十元、但因外匯終硬、錢兌業等稍塞而後回、收盤前因外滙回平、買風再接、高達三千六百五十八元頂盤、惟收盤突降至三千六百二十五元、下午滙市仍鬆、再小至三千六百〇五元低價、人後客帮續進、一度拉高、延至收盤尚爲三千六百十六元、較上日續跌二十八元、全天交易尚暢、共約一千兩光景、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌念八元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開外滙續告鬆硬、人心仍餒、開市遂做小十四元、錢兌業互做三十兩、爲三千六百三十元、少頃證券帮及某金號代客收買、加之售者乘機扳價、立升二十元、證券帮進錢兌業二十兩、爲三千六百五十元、嗣以進者轉少、錢兌業與銀樓帮續來塞出、加之外滙仍在步鬆、逐漸下降三十元、銀樓帮售予金號三十兩、爲三千六百二十元、時錢兌業稍來復進、但現金號仍懷供意、致市勢一度盤旋於三千六百二三十元之間、迨至十一時許、外滙忽報回軟、激動人心、某金號傾向吸收、散戶亦跟踪收買、不久竟盤高至三千六百五十八元、午刻卒以外滙重趨鬆動、散戶頓來復出、加以進者奇缺、立小三十三元、錢兌業吐予證券帮二十兩、爲三千六百二十五元作午收價、午後初開續小五元、錢兌業互二十兩、爲三千六百二十元、繼之再跌二元、銀樓帮賣予錢兌業十兩、爲三千六百十八元、後某現金號吸收拉起五元、現金號進錢兌業三十兩、爲三千六百二十三元、此後某金號代客帮拋塞、加以外滙頗鬆、竟步瀉十八元、金號互做五十兩、爲三千六百〇五元、入後聞外滙回軟、同時港帮前來撈進、遂抬起二十五元、銀樓帮互做二十兩、爲三千六百三十元、卒以證券帮等乘高塞出、重再下降、證券帮吐予錢兌業二十兩、爲三千六百十六元作晚收價、結果比隔昨續跌念八元、聞收後錢兌業及某銀號稍吸、拉起四元、爲三千六百二十元、全天五十三元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進減低二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金再小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時未更、迨至下午二時三十五分掛小五元、結果大同行改懸三百六十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進的均减小十五元之譜、</p>
<h3>貼現轉定</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、業已轉定、每千元初仍三十八元左右、近午退至三十七元、下午堅站原價、比前日再軋小五角、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍開一角五分、未更云、</p>
<h3>雜項　荔枝運銷溫台　生粉到存兩旺</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝因溫台航運復通、昨有裝出二百餘箱、前去應銷、蓋該處貨底甚乏、市價相當高昂、與申價相較、除去一切外費、當差一二十元、</p>
<p>生粉邇來到源陸續、底存尚裕、惟去化較呆、刻已見回降，如飛麒麟爲三十八元、三X標三十七元、GK標三十七元、雙T標三十五元、三T標二十九元、比前跌二三元不一、</p>
<h3>證劵　外債繼續上漲中　連漲三日已十餘鎊　內債反形忐忑不定</h3>
<p>倫敦二日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市步漲不已、鹽稅担保債券、漲風最銳、上檔之英法借款（英發）猛漲七鎊爲四十五鎊、英德續（英發）續升四鎊、爲五十一鎊、善後（英發）續漲三鎊半、爲三十八鎊半、中法美金及克利斯浦各漲三鎊、前者爲四十七鎊、後者爲二十六鎊、費克斯續升一鎊、爲十三鎊、下檔鐵路公債、北寗仍告不動、漲風以京滬爲最、續升三鎊、爲十六鎊、湖廣（德發）及廣九各升一鎊、各爲十四鎊、其餘均漲二鎊、其中道淸及湖廣（非德發）各爲十五鎊、津浦各種均爲十三鎊、</p>
<p>倫敦二日電、今日遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、脚地堅穩、行情漲多跌少、麥加利銀行股續升五先令、爲八鎊五先令、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股回降一鎊、價爲八十一鎊、香港註冊股不動、開平煤礦不記名股續升六便士、爲十七先令六便士、其餘不動、</p>
<p>證劵暗盤市況、因多方之出籠、及拋售之踴躍、漸趨跌風、環境消息、並無重大變化、不過湘戰行將再起、某地又起謠言、引起多方之惶慮、在多方出籠時、投機份子乘勢拋售、市價乃愈覺不支、陣容已釀成塲裏多頭大都脫手、多頭大都落終客戶之手、迨散戶多頭斬結將盡時、當有轉機、因和平空氣仍在若有若無之間也、昨日經過、開始、多方抬價雖見略高、顯已無力而抬價、即係頂爲出籠之地、而放空者乃愈覺有所憑藉、如十一及同康等號之不斷求售、市風一轉頓趨疲象、而尤以下午爲甚、十一號同康生大聯和等均有賣出、德孚天生則抵補、但仍供過於求、乙種遽打破五十元大關、甲種亦破八元關、趨勢仍屬未穩、市價結果續小三角至六角、成交總數共計的七十餘高元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所股市較形沉寂、惟潛勢猶甚堅昂、有數種重見前日高價、但此等價格下、不鮮賣戶活動、各信託公司股仍佔顯要地位、其次爲瑞鎔股與中國墾殖股、橡皮股堅穩如前、</p>
<h3>紗花　生產過勝　紗市急轉直下　國戶不乏出籠　雙馬跌十七元</h3>
<p>上日徘徊之紗市、今則轉趨下游、月跌風尤熾、實則外匯盤旋、而日見鬆弛、同時客帮納胃不暢、港帮昔日雖有採辦、然受金融牽制、根本無龐大的購買力也、於是生意一停、市便即轉下風、一般搶情子之流、鑒於潮流如斯、心灰氣短、情况一疲、跌勢愈烈、綜之存貨地位增高、消費與生產兩相不能平衡、加之財力充足之囤戶、視目前百物下挫、無意作大規模的收藏運動、有一部份反有吐出、就此論之、仍在徘徊之境耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市情略帶疲乏、同業開始互做、廿支雙馬現貨跌一元、爲六百五十三元、成交二十包、旋以廣帮到市相聚、無辦貨消息、同時滙票掛出續長、賣氣忽熾、呌賣聲憲振、市價步步下落、跌至六百四十元收盤、以後打破四十元關口、爲六百三十七元、查半日成交統計八百十二包、行情二十支雙馬跌十七元、天女跌十一元、雙地球跌十三元、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　四五〇　江西　三〇</p>
<p>香港　六五　寗波　二七</p>
<p>溫州　二〇　上日成交二二〇</p>
<p>統計八一〇</p>
<p>白包花尚有做開</p>
<p>本棉交易、盡係同業成交、都是白包花生意、其他棉花全無經營、但中外各廠依然岑寂如恒、大概因紗價不起、對於原料絕無嘗試之念、因此情况尚屬堅穗、通州花身骨優勝之貨、開價爲一百三十四元半、品質較遜之貨、爲一百三十元、市態尚安定、然外匯日趨鬆弛、外棉採辦價日跌、蘇北來源、通州花到一千一百六十三包、常陰沙到二百四十三包、北沙來六百三十包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>
<p>通花　一三〇·〇〇　一三一·五〇　一三二·〇〇　一三四·五〇　同業八〇〇包</p>
<p>太倉花　一二六·〇　又五〇〇包</p>
<p>下沙花　一三〇·〇　又一三五包</p>
<p>火機花　一二一·〇　又二〇包</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、日來已日趨活躍、紗廠方面亦有採辦、同業亦略有訂購、惟俱爲長纖維者、按照目前形勢、滬上紗廠存底菜將枯涸、美棉交易有將逐漸展開之望、惟印棉售價與美棉相較尚貴、故目前印棉交易、將繼續淸淡至相當時期也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日較爲靜寂、惟頗爲堅定、現貨交易殊爲熱鬧、海外棉商購貿亦頗爲踴躍、同業交易亦稱良好、投機者仍抱觀望、擬靜觀最近國會討論棉業貸款問題之發展也、昨日結果收盤紐的近期不動、遠期好三五磅音、印度連同頂測漲起四羅比、埃及漲十磅音、利物浦回跌八便士、</p>
<h3>糧食　新粳又漲　客秈囤戶出售</h3>
<p>杜米徘徊、市面依然未退、前市各貨價仍一度回軟後、昨又轉緊、蓋來源稍稀、紙蘇嘉楓靑等貨到十七八車、且天雨人心復佳、早市觀望、中午本鄉作客見市貨不多、趁廉出手、吃盤亦不苛刻、一時形勢頓緊、新粳及茶種窖種百哥等成交頗濃、有三千餘包、而收盤行情較前增高二三角不一、蘆羊尖因受客尖影響、去路較遜、市價因難與粳市並駕、破襲時屆落令、雖市貨微細、問津不鮮、市面冷淡、因乏變化、陳新變元銷塲不廣、到貨亦稀、價無榮辱、客尖市昨由車輪裝到京蕪尖四五千包、江北尖則仍在兩地市價不合、搬運不易之中、經本鄉店胃搜購、客家有扳持之心、形勢緊俏、京蕪尖相隨跟進、且有內地帮吸收决貨、市色亦佳、但孰料東行及囤戶乘機推出、形勢又現混沌、幸各路銷塲殊旺、收盤尚覺穩健、行情已難提升、成交六千餘包、</p>
<p>另訊客秈初承前日之瘋風、且日商續有零批吐出晨市開價一度抑低、旋以本尖到减、販囤小肯賤脫、隨在內地鄉作添辦之下一致回振、午市行情會見扳佾二三角、高客秈二十二元、尚圖喊高、然市價回好後又有浮囤與江北帮售出、午後市面又呈軟弱、上下午交易、亦祇三千多包、惟聞行號直接批進者亦有二三千包云、</p>
<h3>粉銷漸靜　麥價步升</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉交易、較前减退、本客雖有指辦、均屬零星點綴而已、蓋目下廠方對於大帮交易、仍予限制、而客戶亦不貪取、致市面漸入　局、二號粉廠盤績開七元四角、砲車粉七元五角、回饒貨七元四角八分、外棧兵船粉七元三角、成交二三千包、統市本客成交亦不足三萬包、市面沉靜、</p>
<p>小麥　來源依然稀少、存底亦漸見减、執貨者一味居奇、市面步升不已、惟廠方以價位太高、不願多進、昨福車兩廠祇辦二三千包、囤戶則繼續拉進七八車、價十一元五角半至四角、較前又升一二角、</p>
<h3>絲茶　滬絲仍昂</h3>
<p>昨國外絲市、日平疲、美銳跌、交易所標準絲近期跌一角半停版、遠期跌一角四分半、現貨日絲跌九分至一角、上海絲及廣東絲各跌一角、本埠絲市、最近聞同受兩層壓迫、（匯率長、絲價跌、）外銷呆滯勢所必然、但咋美莊洋行進輯里上身售開二七〇〇元、法莊洋行白廠做開三九五〇元、平心論之、不失爲良好售盤、蓋自一月餘來匯率放長已屆前時之三分之一强、如以美元六·五〇元與九允標準較之、則上海絲價在匯率變動上、巳跌去近千元矣、然邇來絲價尚在高昂綫上、且上海生絲存底原料兩感缺乏、故絲價尚無一蹶不振之勢、然目下絲市、至少已不再是國購居奇之良機矣、</p>
<h3>油市　豆油鬆動</h3>
<p>豆油因來源相接、雖被大戶操縱、但籌碼已覺寬舒、致潛勢鬆動、人心平定、昨市晨跌午回、統市計開大連油八十桶、價自六十五元開盤、六十六元收盤、神戶油九十桶、六十六元、靑島桶油五十桶、六十五元、烟歧油二百件、四十八元五角、靑歧油一百三十件、四十八元、四日由烟台來豆油一百五十件、北沙來豆子四百十包、五日豆子出口運香港一千四百九十包、這新加坡七百五十五包、生油運書港九百聽、</p>
<h3>糖市　國糖頗見活動</h3>
<p>國糖前咋兩日頗見活動、再度上展、潮帮開出黄崗靑一千四五百包、高莊三十八元、次之三十六元、又上白粉數千包五十七元、廣帮開出箱莊片靑三百六十件、三十二元什路帮開出上刁靑五百五十包、三十五元（現鈔）、較前漲起一二元不一、洋糖以外滙復長、美金又小、趨勢愈弱、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白跌一元半、本棧五十一元、外棧初爲五十二元、旋降至五十一元八角至五角、轉口貨四十一元、太古車白B嘜呌五十七元、未成交、荷赤小一元三角爲四十一元半、本綿白及本冰俱見隨鬆、市象頗形不振、</p>
<h3>疋頭　浙東布銷轉旺</h3>
<p>布市以浙東現銷有力、形勢頗爲穩定、怡和新裕二廠出品輕重磅粗布、以廠方現貨缺乏、售盤轉佳、各該廠出品十三·十四磅粗布售聲已超過普通十六磅貨之價格、輕磅粗布成交亦旺、價每疋績漲一角至一角、細布·細斜及漂染印花各布價一致平定、浙東甬紹溫台各帮續辦粗布·色布·色斜·嗶嘰等貨三百餘件、閩粵帮亦辦進二百餘件、本街辦細布·細斜·粗布·絨布·印花布近二百件、國外暹　辦色布·色斜·漂布一千餘疋、東疋昨因日商洋行休業無市、</p>

<h3>越界築路交涉　工部局建議內容　計分兩款注重警權問題　整個權益決不考慮放棄</h3>
<p>關於越界築路交涉、自領團領袖領事納羅尼中校從旁幹旋、二十三日晚、工部局總董樊克令訪僞「市長」傅筱庵、打開僵局後、工部局總辦費利溥及總監鮑恩、卽起草解决方案、巳於前日下午四時三十分、由工部局總董樊克令總辦兼總裁費利溥、赴市中心區、面交僞「市長」傅筱庵、聞三人會談的半小時、樊傅兩氏、會對建議各點、有所解釋、傅允從長考慮、此項交涉、遂有急轉直下之勢、</p>
<p>滬西惡化情形、業巳引起國際反響、英美兩國咸寄以嚴重之注意與關切、此事將循外交途徑處理之、星期三英外部副秘書白端、在下院答復對於該項問題之質問時、白氏曾確述其意見、謂上海界外糾紛、確愈趨尖銳化、並謂英美駐日兩大使、巳奉命向日政府提出交涉、要求將該項滬西界外區域間題、予以澈底解决、</p>
<p>建議內容　計分兩項</p>
<p>工部局所提出之方案、文字共爲六頁、係用打字機打出、每行間空二行、工部局所提建議凡兩項、（一）越界築路上之警權、仍由工部局管轄、（二）越界築路地帶、則由工部局僞市府共同管理、作爲暫時阻止衝突事件續發、維持治安辦法、並鄭重表示此非永久協定、傅則堅持全面接收、爲根本解决辦法、但亦不反對暫時協定之締結、雙方會談結果、僞「市長」已允對工部局方案、作慎重之考慮、</p>
<p>滬西局勢　暫可小康</p>
<p>現雙方所談者、為警權問題、至捐稅問題、尚擱置不談、但據接近工部局方面者傳出消息、工部局所擬之全部解决方案、爲凡越界築路之權、由工部局管轄、兩側房屋捐稅、則由僞「市府」徵收、工部局在越界築路所支用之公用事業經費、則由僞「市府」取償、但此說未能證實、據外人方面觀察、此糾紛已久之越界築路問題、或者不日即可暫告一段落、惟此種暫時解决辦法、最多僅能使工部局於日僞相安與極端期間內、日僞仍必得隴望蜀、續行侵逼、終至成爲日美關係更趨惡化之一因素也、</p>
<p>租界權益　並不放棄</p>
<p>此項建議、是否能早日發生效果、樊克令·費利溥　傅筱庵·三人昨晨均拒絕表示意見、工部局總董樊克令僅謂一余時時充滿此希望一、傅筱庵則稱「此事需要長時間之考慮」、費利溥則吿記者、「彼不準備作何聲明」云云、因工部局希望對於此項交涉、在進行中、暫不願宜洩其內容也、惟據工部局某要員談、「工部局對越界築路之權益、不能視爲完全放棄、則君對六頁建議之內容、可知其梗概矣」、</p>
<p>日偽覬覦　滬西水電</p>
<p>滬西越界築路之警權問題、現方由公共租界當局與僞方討論解决之道、而日僞方面之「華中水電公司」又思乘機覬覦越界築路之水電供給權、日文大陸新報已於前晚公開宣傳、記者咋訪上海電力公司董事長霍金司氏、詢其意見、霍氏答稱、余對此種無糟可笑之言、毫無所畏、又指出西區電力、現下係由滬西電力公司供給、該公司係獲中美兩國政府當局之特准、</p>
<p>西報所載　晤談經過</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局總董樊克令與總辦兼總裁費利溥、携局方公文於昨日（二日）午後四時三十分、赴「市長」傅筱庵之江灣寓所、訪晤傅氏、是項文件、係用打字機兩面繕成、共計六張、內含工部局解決界外馬路問題的久懸爭執之建議、樊氏等三人會同討論此建議、歷時</p>
<p>近半小時</p>
<p>所談以解釋局方文件所含各點爲限、除「建議」之原本外、副本一份、亦已交傅氏、樊氏等三人今（三日）晨對此建議能吾早日獲得結果、均不發肯定之言、據樊克令告記者稱、「余恒抱希望」、傅筱庵則稱、「此事須加</p>
<p>長久考慮」、費利溥稱、渠尚無可奉告者、因工部局希望暫時避不公布此事也、工部局某員頃與記者談話、並稱、「不能預料工部局將讓棄其在界外馬路之一切權利、」由此語可察知工部局建議所含內容、但衆意工部局咋交傅氏之建議內容、大部份或係爭執區</p>
<p>警務問題</p>
<p>之建議、工部局某員昨日曾向新聞記者宜稱、解決雙方爭端之建議、乃係「暫時」性質、但該員未提及向界外馬路區居民收稅事、查工部局前曾表示非至與該區有關的其他問題商得滿意之妥洽、則不欲放棄收稅權利、</p>
<p>偽警又有　野蠻舉動</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、頃聞大道警察在界外馬路續有野蠻行動、而在安和寺路哥侖比亞路口公共汽車中、向英籍婦女兩人摑頰、此事發生於星期一日午後六時左右、但至今始傳出、該兩英婦所以未曾報吿此事者、非因心緒煩亂、即因認爲將此事報告在該區一再受辱之警務處、亦屬徒然故也、事緣該兩婦乘公共汽車至安和寺路哥侖比亞路口、見大道警察若干名、携無口套之犬、同入該車、一婦乃向大道警察責問、結果大道警察一名、故意向該婦摑頰、另一英婦抗辯、亦被批掌、</p>
<h3>華軍密佈市郊　日軍突然戒備　滬北市區巡邏不絕　滬西外圍華軍待機　蘇州河北甲區檢查愈緊</h3>
<p>虹口區內日海陸軍部隊、昨起忽採取嚴密戒備、憲兵各分隊（每隊十餘人）四出巡邏、形勢頗趨緊張、佔領區如引翔區、新閘區·江灣區·各地、由日軍部派遣馬隊每隊三十餘人（均身穿黄呢軍服武裝齊備）、往來巡邏、同時江灣路日軍總司令部後海能路租界部隊、亦派出裝有輕機關槍之機器脚踏車隊出動梭巡、據大光社記者探悉、日方採取此項措置、完全因近郊華軍活躍異常、深恐被潛入區內、實施襲擊、故其情形、殊爲慌張、</p>
<p>河北甲區　檢查嚴厲</p>
<p>蘇州河北甲區、北江西路文監師路及海寗路口、兩鐵絲網缺口處、站崗之日哨兵、對進出居民、檢查昨又苛嚴、尤對靑年壯丁及擔荷物件者爲甚、同時閘北寶山路口、與北河南路底英兵對峙站立之日哨兵二名、對經過該處之居民、盤請亦極苛嚴、且時迫令解衣待其檢查、進出者視爲畏途、此舉實防華方乘機混入云、</p>
<p>兩路沿綫</p>
<p>四郊風聲緊張聲中、日僞方面紛紛從事提早實行所謂「冬防」、浦東一帶上南上川兩路、現對來往乘客、搜查甚嚴、以防危險份子混入市區、且日軍與游擊隊間、雖有僞「軍」張妙根徐鴻發秦興炎等三部爲屏障、但僞「軍」後方時有游擊隊出沒、直接予日軍據點嚴重威脅、日海陸軍原可入晚安枕者、今則碌碌終夜、扼守要口、不得安寗、南市方面城廂內外尚較安全、南車站龍華及迤西沿南北車站銜接鐵道以西之弧形外圍錢內外、不特深晚、即白畫亦有游擊隊通過、日軍往往以人少視若無覩、此項游擊隊、密佈四郊、將待正規軍到達指定地點、聯絡成功後、有所進取、</p>
<h3>京滬電綫　連日損壞</h3>
<p>華軍活動部隊、在此一星期中、沿京滬滬杭鐵路錢異常活躍、日軍事機關雖連日抽調日僞軍趕往各處城鎮滿佈重兵戒備、而沿南京至上海之軍用電錢及電報局之有錢電報綫、迭决損壞、雖經派工匠分段趕速修理、而修竣彼處後、他處又遭損壞、昨日眞茹至南翔段之錢、有工人十餘名、在彼處修理云、</p>
<h3>平湖日軍　築汽車路</h3>
<p>平湖業人談、駐平湖城內之日軍、現為軍事上運輸便利起見、決定在該縣南門至北門之間、建築汽車路、最近已將甘河一帶填平、並通告該處各居民戶、一律須將房屋拆退數尺、現楊家橋一帶房屋、巳均將門面拆去、</p>
<h3>永遠解決難民問題　籌募基金百萬　目前正竭力疏散難民　尚待救濟者約一萬人</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（二日）本市重要求救濟工作人員之目標爲準備基金一百萬兀、以謀永遠解决上海之難民問題、從事此種艱巨任務之工作人員、有工部局華董虞洽卿與袁履登等、虞·袁·兩氏、分任上海難民救濟協會主席與秘書長、據袁氏告記者稱、刻正竭力疏散此間難民、或遺送彼等返里、或助使得業、俾能自立、</p>
<p>有一萬人　全賴救濟</p>
<p>但上海至少尚有貧苦者一萬人、全賴慈善救濟、此數包括被迫來滬而無家可歸之老弱與孤兒在內、允以中日戰起後流亡來滬者爲多、百萬元計劃、仍在開始階段、此款一部份將自協會逐月所募維持貧民之款項餘額中撥出、此外、日後將取他法籌款、充實基金、以期於最短期內達此目標、</p>
<p>大收容所　辦理完善</p>
<p>同時、本市各收容所內難民、總數仍逾三萬七千人、內居協會主持之兩收容所者、的一萬三千人、惇信路收容所可容難民一萬人者、巳於本年上半年開放、協會除以膳宿借給所中難民外、並在其中設立工塲、敎導難民得一技之長、並儘可能僱用之、但該收容所開放後、已移交救世軍直接管理、今該所管理權與實業及敎育部份、均由救世軍人員負責、</p>
<p>積餘款項　足敷應用</p>
<p>協會所辦延平路收容所、亦巳提議交救世軍管理、惟救世軍尚未認爲宜加接收、居該收容所內者、自行償付全數或一部份生活費用、袁氏複稱、渠所管理之貧民、爲數雖衆、但在此後冬令數月內、苟非遇未可逆料之情勢、則協會在經濟上當能處理救濟問題、春夏兩季所積餘款、足敷意料中之需要、上海生活程度高漲、巳使辦理救濟事宜、大感困難、自夏季起、難民每人口糧所費、巳自二元增至五元、袁氏對共同工作者、備致贊揚、據稱自團體成立以來、共同工作者、至少十二人、以一部份或全部時間義務服務、惟抱眞正犧牲精神者、始能如此慷慨服務、</p>

<h3>外匯與法幣　上海購外滙者不能生息　法幣價値低落已達止境</h3>
<p>——耿愛德之觀察——</p>
<p>英經濟專家耿愛德氏對上海之外匯黑市有所剖析、足資參考、</p>
<p>進出口貿易槪況</p>
<p>（一）進口貿易凡屬奢侈品及歐戰所需之物資、今已自然不復闌入中國市塲、而棉花一項、經數月之停頓後、復自美國輸入、其價額每月平均美金二三百萬元、一方米與麥二者、則以此項商品及麵粉、在此間市價太低、不能入口、（二）出口貿易中、中國爲外力侵占之局面、一日不改、其出口貿易即無法自主、今之輸出商品、以日本佔第一位、同時有損於中國外匯者、厥爲海峽殖民地·南非洲·澳洲·法國·等、對於中國工業出品之限制入口、</p>
<p>外滙之統　制與投機</p>
<p>（三）外匯統制、現在法幣匯價雖遠較基金存在時爲低、但其主持者似謀以供售外匯時、所獲之大宗法幣、復行購回外匯、於最近三個月間、已經購回者、的二三百萬鎊、大致每當市况趨鬆時、出而吸收售方之供額、（四）投機上海外滙、投機交易、現不甚巨、英匯及美匯之遠期買賣、多有出於經營金條者之抵補關係者、但所謂港帮有投機之活動、當七八月間、彼爲大購戶、嗣變爲大售戶、新加坡繼之、此類舉動、究爲純粹投機、抑爲南半球之資金逃避、尚難論定、</p>
<p>上海匯市　挺俏原因</p>
<p>（五）投資、近三年來此間有大宗法幣被易購爲外滙、允以出於中國人之所爲者居大部份、旣易爲外匯、此項資金即未能生息、而今中國資本家多有認爲法幣對外比價低落已達止境者、况現今匯價對彼已大有利、際此放棄外匯收回法幣、又何樂而不爲、近來確有大宗外滙交易、屬此性質、使此問匯市益趨挺佾、</p>
<p>匯市前途窺測一班</p>
<p>（六華北紙幣）、現有多種貨幣、在國內流通、與法幣係居於敵對地位、其危機未容忽視、如聯銀」幣在北方市塲流通、其價低於法幣者已歷多時、嘗有一時低至三成、但今則情勢相反、似此則存有華北紙幣者、不能自由易取外匯、即隨時匯滬向此間易購外幣、總之、華北向上海市塲攫取外滙、蓋極有可能性者、以上爲與匯市榮枯有關之主要數端、但匯市最後之命運、大部份仍須取決於戰事之持續性、若於三個月內可以獲得不礙及中國前途發展之安定、則法幣匯價、勢將在漲、吾則匯市鬆勢、恐難持久也、</p>
<h3>工部局律師　王耀堂請辭職</h3>

<p>但不懸牌營業、經友人之介紹、施即委託楊批一命書、然事前並未將丁所言告知、及楊將命書批出、乃亦稱施必於九月需死、施益懼、求解救之術於楊、經楊考慮之下、謂解救非無法、惟須用「接生氣」方法、始可挽救、該法設壇求神、終相當時期、在此期內、神必示意、須以</p>
<p>現鈔供奉</p>
<p>其數亦由神示知、母得稍遲、向時楊命施於求神之時、若有所疑、可備信封一個、內儲白紙一張、供奉神前、然後默禱、未幾、啟示、該信封則白紙上已滿書答語、是以施益深信不疑、經過長久時期、凡神示供奉之款需幾何、施從未敢違、一一照辦、迄今的</p>
<p>達數萬金</p>
<p>當時楊曾言此款於佻神畢、可予歸還、但後楊忽稱、現因時局不定、此軟一時不能由爾執掌、吾則恐獲神譴、不如暫存於銀行保管箱、施亦從之、乃將歷决供神之鈔票（外由楊以紙包裏）存儲於金城齦行保管庫、後楊施附人、因此而成知交、楊旋擬創辦、味力多味精廠、</p>
<p>施亦投資</p>
<p>數萬金（該廠辦事處設於漢口路一三一號四樓）、最近楊洽民又代施妻課命、又謂其流年不利、所有首飾等、概不能戴飾、囑令嚴藏、詎至最近、施妻因戚家喜事、需戴首飾、乃將封存之紙包啟視、則內中飾物均己</p>
<p>不舅而飛</p>
<p>所存者盡屬碎紙而已、至此、始知楊前之種種、盡屬騙局、金城銀行保管庫內之鈔票、定亦成廢紙無疑、卽其所稱創辦味力多味精廠等、亦必騙取其資金而已、於是報吿總巡捕房、經華探長蔣上佩·楊培生·偵查屬實、於前日在大西路</p>
<p>將楊弋獲</p>
<p>昨晨解送特一法院刑四庭、由戴榮鐸推事開庭提訊、捕房律師錢恂九以本案情節複雜、偵查費時、且原告被騙之數、現尚難確貨計算、大約爲八萬至十萬元左右也、故請求准予將被告暫行羈押、候查明後、正式起訴云云、詰之楊洽民供、所騙之款、大約僅二萬金左右云云、載推事核供、乃諭令楊洽民押候改期再訊、</p>

<h3>猜測</h3>
<p>— 澹然</p>
<p>現代有多少大發明，是由猜測而來的，於是喜歡猜測者，便振振有詞，以爲猜測之於今日，是不可或缺的生活耍件。小而言之，不管我自己作事如何，對人如何，先要猜測別人對我如何；大而言之，不管我自己究竟應該如何努力，如何準備，只管猜測中日戰爭的前途，歐洲戰爭的結局。於是有的疑神疑鬼，有的投機趨巧。猜測猜測，到處一片猜測之聲。</p>
<p>盲目的猜測，有如算命或談相，有識之士當然是不會相信的。只有按着事理分析，或由因推果，或由果推因的猜測，才會被一般人所接受。聰明的猜測者，更善於將兩方面的情勢，一一比列，然後設下若干假定，以爲不這樣便那樣，不那樣便這樣，說得圓轉如意，八面玲瓏，而不下一個肯定的結論，而博得別人的稱讚。（例如：明天如果不下雨，一定會晴；吾則，明天如果是晴天，一定不下雨。）</p>
<p>究竟怎樣的猜測，才算合理，才可予以成立，我想我還是不管，留待別人去猜測吧。在我看來，我却以爲我們不需要猜測，至少在現在。因爲我認爲要作合理的猜測，是有先決的條件的，那就是必須耍具備充份的知議，精闢的觀察，以作淸楚的分析，然後才能够獲得事有必至，理有固然的結果。我們現在的猜測者，究竟有幾個人達到了這樣的程度呢？如果沒有這樣的程度而從事猜測，還不是夢囈嗎！</p>
<p>於此可見，要達到這種完美的猜測程度，是非常難的，那末，我們何必要費這樣的準備工夫，來從事於此，反而將我們應爲之事，可爲之事，其成就也許更爲偉大之事，丟在一旁呢！至於在現在，我甚至想，即使誰巳有了這種猜測的本領，我也希望他不要以猜測爲事：如果不能去幹一些較爲切實的事，那末，即使只會掉掉三寸不爛之舌，或者只會紙上談兵的，也儘可以說幾句或寫幾行較爲切實的話，於事實有補的話。</p>
<p>最後，我再斷言一句：猜測不過是猜測，不足爲憑。猜測而中的，只是極少數的例外。在我們的眼裏，已經看見過多少無聊的猜測，成爲破碎的肥皂泡。我們究竟爲什麼還要這樣的樂於猜測呢？</p>
<h3>灰色的一羣</h3>
<p>— 林豪</p>
<p>這一條熱鬧的路，簡直像一道污濁不堪的河。裏面寄生着一羣骯髒而活潑的蟲，隨着濁流，飄到東又飄到西。河又過於的狹窄，車輛又多，人物熙熙攘攘，整天游呀游地不停着，永沒有安靜。淤塞的街，淤塞的河流啊！</p>
<p>他們這一羣小得有趣的蟲，掩掩藏藏地隱着自己的醜陋；混在車馬裏，偷偷摸摸。</p>
<p>生活之動態。</p>
<p>一輛大卡車緩吞吞地過去，車後塞飽着一車橫呀豎呀的木料。</p>
<p>蟲游得更活潑了，倏的仲出兩支瘦得像鷹爪的黑手，張大兩顆灰眼珠；先張望一下坐在木料上談天的苦力們，然後才用一股吃奶的勁道，哼呀哼的抓着根較小的木料向後拖。</p>
<p>「他媽的！」苦力們順手掮過備好了的手杖（還不是一些小的木料，）臨空虛幌一幌</p>
<p>一羣懷着熱望而沒有得手的蟲，頓時像多生了翅膀，一窩蜂地飛散了。</p>
<p>然而，一個蟲已抓到了一根，親熱地懷抱着，拐着腿奔得好快。</p>
<p>黑瘦得似鬼的臉，嘻開嘴，露出一口齷齪焦黄，參差不齊的牙，笑了起來：</p>
<p>「呵呵！眞不容易呀！」</p>
<p>另一條蟲，扮着無表情的烏臉，靠着電綫木，妬着同伴的「得利」。</p>
<p>一羣蟲又去我他們另外的生路。</p>
<p>好的是這條路竟父像一畝什麽都有的豐田，給蟲們「開發」着，變得更肥沃了。</p>
<p>這不是一輛煤屑車嗎？三五個黑人蹲在一籮籮的煤屑上面開玩兒。那正是蟲子們的好機會，看他們吃力地壓低自己的身子，兩個恐怖的骷髏似的窟窿，照例注視着上面，用兩支戰抖的手，遲疑而迅速地，抓着煤屑，抓到一口備好了的袋子裏。</p>
<p>勝利了。</p>
<p>以後，他們便哼着失潤的嗓音，走遍了大街小巷，尋一個刻薄的主顧，換來十數個子兒，（自然囉！有時是不止這些的。）珍愛地懷着。又繼着去幹他們的生活。</p>
<p>天黑了，蟲子一個個少起來，這混濁的污流漸漸地寂寞而無生意了。</p>
<p>暗角落裏，一羣蟲們一個個伸着倦怠的懶腰，蓆着破絮，蓋一些「紅綠被　」的報紙，弓倒頭便呼呼睡熟了。</p>
<p>秋風捲着殘葉，蕭蕭地，把一羣蟲弄成一條條蠶寶寶似的，蜷曲着；或是擁抱着，做他們白天裏冒險家底夢。</p>
<p>明天的早晨僵着的蟲又甦醒過來；或者會添上翅膀飛呀飛地更活躍在濁流上。</p>
<h3>泛舟</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>我愛看水，水是那末深邃，澄澄的柔波，又明媚得粼粼地。它幽雅而靜穆，却也活潑似懷娥鈴的低奏，像曉寒拂過殿角，風鈴淸越的哦吟。我愛游魚悠然往還，穿梭在藻荇中的情景：迂迥於水底，一側，又在帶似的深鬱的色彩中閃起銀光一爍。</p>
<p>我生長在水鄉，而始終沒有覺到對水的嚴倦我們眷戀水，也正如眷戀着可愛的家鄉一樣。我總喜獨自倚踞在小河邊的大靑石上，注視着深靑色澄澄的秀水，石樁上蒼鬱的靑苔和淺灘上的蚌貝。</p>
<p>一聲聲的款乃，播蕩着一圈圈的漪紋，允其是夜露生凉的皎潔月夜，朝霧迷濛的早晨；船夫輕撥着小舟，格兒悠閑地擺蕩在明波裏。或是肥大的鴨子呷呷地撲着雙翼，皎潔的白鵝像紳士般的泛漾在河面，詩意的幽趣呵，總悠然流過了心頭。</p>
<p>我懊戀着，是艷羨，也是遐想，我總不能滌去懸浮着泛舟的幽趣。</p>
<p>撇去一身夢魘似的憂抑和疲憊，也拋忘了生活的機械和倦怠，給水面的漣漪蒙絡住，我們蕩漾在南湖的碧波間，我們生疏地劃着溶溶的水波，淸風裏飄起薄霧，凉意撒上熱刺刺的面頰，並在我們胸襟上畫着一片片水漬。我們輕鬆地划着小舟，四圍籠住了垂着的袞柳，烟波心中的亭台樓榭：織碎的紅葉裏掩着烟雨樓的紅牆，頂上蓋着蒼穹，波面泛動白雲，槳兒如翼，彷彿在自由天地間翱翔。</p>
<p>粗野的笑聲碎裂着淳美的空氣。我們粗野地划，粗野地打着水波，不小心便撞進行行菱藻中，拉出槳來，巳縛十了一串串靑翠欲滴的南湖菱。</p>
<p>待水珠溶和汗珠，我們便泛進柳蔭，水濱的水蓼，和野花繚繞在船邊，小魚穿掠過倦怠的槳……</p>
<p>何時才能捏起生疏的獎兒呢？我不禁父懷想着天涯的伙伴了。三年來飄忽的行綜，再從何處去找他們的音訊呢？我底記憶似乎是個美麗的夢，游樂的閑情早已消失；然而更熱烈地眷戀着家鄉。</p>
<p>家鄉正開着更鮮艷更美麗的花，在現在！</p>
<p>趕製寒衣　克汀</p>
<h3>「明天」，我要歌頌您</h3>
<p>— 來紅</p>
<p>『明天』，我要歌頌您！</p>
<p>但我也不全是歌頌您；——</p>
<p>像六月天太陽的火把</p>
<p>儘管燒紅了咱們的世界，</p>
<p>也未必能够使各種人的心間，</p>
<p>感覺得這是春天以後的進展，</p>
<p>或則甚至祇是一點點的和暖。</p>
<p>『明天』，我也不瞎歌頌。</p>
<p>您納粹和棒喝的</p>
<p>棺材里倒出來的東西；</p>
<p>我也不歌頌，</p>
<p>讓懶散的生活侵蝕了的年靑人</p>
<p>儘囔着的「明天，明天！」</p>
<p>怕『明天』遲了給他們來埋葬。——</p>
<p>這些，我不會歌頌你『明天』；</p>
<p>我不是軍長一個大鼻子的鄧甫遮，</p>
<p>看什麼都像是分不淸的一團，</p>
<p>更別說集中營里的囚犯們</p>
<p>手銬上怎的有時會冒出冷汗！</p>
<p>然而您，『明天』，</p>
<p>我還是要歌頌您！</p>
<p>不過挑選了卡爾和伊里奇</p>
<p>與友邦露西亞紅光萬丈的『明天』。</p>
<p>我要讓出多少頁的稿箋！</p>
<p>把使我煩心暫時擱開，</p>
<p>來歌頌我們抗戰建國的『明天』，</p>
<p>呌弱小民族英勇地用槍砲替代</p>
<p>那決口般但是空虛的在歡和喝彩！</p>
<p>在今日，呵『明天』！</p>
<p>您可別笑我還沒有能力；</p>
<p>我是在鍜鍊着自己</p>
<p>像樂隊的一位鼓手在絞緊他小鼓的皮。</p>
<p>我得盡力抬高您被歌頌的價值，</p>
<p>跟前綫的弟兄們一樣；</p>
<p>決不儘嚷着『明天，明天！』</p>
<p>却同時又呆呆地等着。</p>
<p>呵，『明天』！『明天』的新世紀！</p>
<p>我是準要歌頌您的，</p>
<p>在那新世紀的『明天』！</p>

<h3>冀省水災義務戲漫記　——章遏雲別來無恙</h3>
<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>燕平會館爲救濟冀省水災，假座黄金大戲院，前晚起始，演戲三天。是夕犬軸爲章遏雲之仕林祭塔，」前塲復有宋德珠之「金山寺，」吳彥衡袁世海之「連環套。」</p>
<p>吳彥衡袁世海之「連環套，」巳演過數决，頗獲好評。是夕吳彥衡嗓稍失潤，致演來反無前數次之精彩，雖「見彭」時之報名，仍用足氣力，博一滿堂彩，但其他翻高處，皆未着力；唱亦敷衍而巳，未免美中不足。故世海竟喧賓奪主，黄天霜反無寶爾壩之受人歡迎矣。吳袁二人之唸白，有兩處理應改正，一彥衡「拜山」一塲，有</p>
<p>「白畫有三百兵家丁，夜晚有五百名敎席，」一句，而世海接下句，則唸成「何况那三百家丁，二百名敎席，」顯見與彥衡所唸，互相矛盾，而照楊小樓所唸，確爲「三百名家丁二百名敎席」彥衡既爲楊派武生，理應照小樓之詞句唸，故此非世海之錯，而爲彥衡之錯也。世海在「盜鈎」一塲，唸刀上之字，爲「金鏢副將黄，」實「漕標副將黄」之誤，此兩點雖爲小節，進出頗大，望吳袁二人能注意及之。</p>
<p>「連環套」後，爲宋德珠之「水漫金山寺，」德珠此來，以此戲最有號召，前後公演十餘决，每决必賣滿堂，非眞有佳處，曷克臻此。此戲扮相好看。崑腔曲子動聽，劇情普遍，皆爲主因；加以搭配齊整，更盡牡丹綠葉之能事，德珠此戲，所打之出手，神出鬼沒，令人拍案呌絕，與宋金聲之一塲對槍，更有天衣無縫之妙，大軸爲章遏雲之祭塔，遏雲今春在滬，演唱甚久，極獲顧曲者之激賞，此番捲土重來，嗓音較春間益見瞭亮，大段反二簧，歌來佳腔百出，令人回味無窮。配以穆鐵芬之胡索，相得益彰，聞遏雲巳爲黄金再度邀妥，將繼王玉蓉後登台云。</p>
<h3>銀壇花絮</h3>

<h3>藝壇簡訊</h3>
<p>紐約式收音機　一九四〇年新型亞爾西愛勝利紐約式收昔機，式樣摩登，成績卓越。在廉價收音機中，堪稱空前優美之出品。本埠美國勝利唱機公司爲公開表演該項收音機之成續起見，特於昨日（三日）下午五時半，在北京路國華大樓該公司之樣子間舉行展覽。同時並映有聲影片，片中詳述紐約式收音機之設計及構造，各界人士前往參觀者極爲踴躍。此項收音機現貨巳由美運到，各大公司無綫電行均有陳列，歡迎各界士女前往參觀試聽，不取分文。</p>
<p>影聯劇團停演　電影巨子張石川等組織上海影聯劇團，於九月一日起假座辣斐劇塲公演話劇，至十月三十一日止，巳歷兩月，成續至佳，社會頗有好評，聞因各公司電影工作緊張，諸演員均須全神貫注，若再兼顧話劇，勢必影響及於本身事業，故自十一月一日起巳停止公演，以後辣斐劇塲之話劇，巳與該團絕無關係矣。</p>
<h3>「王寶釧」卒吿成功</h3>
<p>— 文波</p>
<p>——將在大上海獻映——</p>
<p>「王寶釧」自經熊式一譯成英文本在海外上演後，深得好評，於是此劇遂成爲世界名著，數年前，唐瑛女士曾在光陸大戲院表演英文「王寶釧」，成績亦斐然可觀，是時，藝華公司即謀將此劇搬上銀幕，由卜萬蒼史東山應雲衛等聯合導演，劇本且送往首都電檢會審查通過，厥後不知何故，竟告延擱，戰後人材四散，此喧傳人口之「王寶釧」攝成電影一事，幾爲人所遺忘。今春藝華又大發宏願，決將「王實釧」攝成，一再籌劃，卒底於成，導演人係細膩著稱之吳村，主角則聘古典美人張翠紅，而由李英貂斑華輔之，允稱銀壇佳作，開攝以來，閱時頗久，蓋此片將運往海外，在攝製上不能不愼重也。現聞全部已告竣事，將在大上海獻映，中國電影之能引國際人士注目者，當推此片，故「王寶釧」問世，亦爲國產藝壇上之珍貴收穫也。圖爲張翠紅文逸民趙珍妮表演「三擊掌」之一幕。</p>
<h3>舞團寫影</h3>
<p>— 小田</p>
<p>關於舞女聯誼社</p>
<p>日前我在銀行俱樂部吃飯，碰見了林康侯君，他告訴我許多關於舞女聯誼社組織的情形，並邀我去參觀，抱歉得很，我竟沒有機會去觀光。十月廿九日那</p>
<p>（四八）　天，該社假麗都舞廳舉行餐舞籌募經費，每客一券，每券十元，由該社各舞星蒞塲免費伴舞。沈維英是一位銷券的幹員，我們一班朋友，也承購了七八張，屆時都不免到塲參與盛典。</p>
<p>是日到塲的舞女，約有三十餘人，舞客約在百人以上，因爲免費伴舞的關係，舞客的舞與，似乎特別濃厚，一時大有粥少僧多之概。我是邀了舞伴去的，但爲想多知道一點社中情形起見，故仍時常去請求各社員伴舞。我探悉她們社中巳開辦了國文班和英文班，尚有縫紋班和平劇班，正在籌設之中。</p>
<p>她們組織這社的動機，爲了感覺到舞女這職業的時間性，在人生的過程中，實在太短暫了，通常自十五六投身舞女界，到二十五六就非另謀出路不可了，而且這十年之間，所謂黄金時代者，還不過十八九至廿二三，算來僅僅五年，過了這五年，難這就不想活下去了麽？她們唯一的出路，就是嫁人，照社會趨勢看去，一個飽食終日永不工作的人，漸漸有些維持不下去了。再照生活程度的趨勢看去，一個人能養活一個老婆和他的子女，已經很費勁了。那能再添一個外室的負担呢？况且納妾叉是犯法的呢。所以她們要在嫁人的出路之外，另外我一條眞實職業的出路，耍想過了舞女時代，也能够自食其力，即使嫁得如意郎君，能够給對方一種助力，豈不更好嗎。</p>
<p>她們又向我說，有一部份舞塲職員，悞解了她們的意思，以爲她們組織這個社，是專爲對抗舞塲方面的，其實舞塲和舞女，根本應抱着互助互利共存共榮的宗旨，舞塲祇要不使用非理的壓迫，舞女們根本就沒有對抗的心思，况且舞女們若是能够提高些智識，對於與塲方的意旨，祇有可以多了解一點，於塲方也並非沒有些間接利益呀。</p>

<h3>Even if Soviet-Japanese Relations Improve, It Will Not Affect China's Resistance War – An Editorial in Xinhua Daily – Japanese Prime Minister States Foreign Policy, Had Lengthy Meeting with Konoe</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Communist Party's newspaper, Xinhua Daily, stated in an editorial today that the improvement of Soviet-Japanese relations will not affect the Soviet Union's determination to continue assisting China. The newspaper quoted Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov as saying that the conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union is meaningless and expressed his willingness to consider reasonable suggestions for improving relations with Japan, believing that Japan could achieve its goals if it improved relations with the Soviet Union. However, the improvement of Soviet-Japanese relations will not affect the Soviet Union's determination to assist China, so those who hope that the Soviet Union will pull chestnuts out of the fire for others will be greatly disappointed. (3rd Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Prime Minister Abe gave a detailed speech to visiting journalists today. Before meeting with the journalists, Abe had a lengthy meeting with Privy Council President Konoe, explaining the Japanese government's attitude and policy towards establishing a new "Central Government" in China. The meeting lasted eighty minutes before adjourning. Abe told the reporters about the meeting, saying, "Since forming the cabinet, I have not yet met with Konoe, and because Konoe will be leaving Tokyo on Sunday, I was eager to meet with him. This meeting was initiated by me. At that time, I explained in detail the methods decided by the Asia Development Board meeting on Wednesday, which Konoe was very concerned about. In the future, we may hold a meeting of the Asia Development Board every week to make decisions. As far as I know, the routine work of organizing the new "Central Government" in China is currently progressing smoothly. The date of completion may be earlier than expected." Abe then mentioned Japan's foreign relations, saying that one way to eliminate some powers' misunderstandings of Japan is to negotiate with them separately. Another way is to deal with the handling of their rights and interests in China. However, I believe that at present, in addition to establishing the new "Central Government" in China, there is no need to simultaneously take on the responsibility of adjusting relations with third-party powers. Negotiations between Japan and the United States may or may not take the same form as the recent British-Japanese meeting. In short, relations with the United States must be adjusted. Abe finally mentioned the recent speech by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, saying that the true meaning of Molotov's speech is difficult to discern, but his statement that the Soviet Union is prepared to adjust relations with Japan and conclude an agreement with Japan can be considered as a desire to conclude a trade agreement with Japan. However, the current problem is that it is impossible to order the other party to make contact first. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Has Not Left Chongqing Recently</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese sources claim that Soviet Ambassador to China Pan Youxin will go to Shanghai to meet with Soviet Ambassador to Japan Smetanin. The Soviet Embassy here has firmly denied this, calling it a "wishful thinking" of the Japanese side. This rumor may have arisen from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's mention of the possibility of Soviet-Japanese trade relations. However, the Soviet Union's desire to establish trade relations with Japan cannot be considered as a trend towards political compromise. At the same time, even in terms of trade relations, no action is likely to be taken in the near future. As for the Soviet Ambassador, he is currently slightly indisposed and does not wish to leave Chongqing. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sichuan-Kang Construction Promotion Association Holds First Regular Meeting Yesterday, Discusses the Powers of Each Office and Work Requiring Special Attention</h3>
<p>Chengdu: The Sichuan-Kang Construction Promotion Association of the National Senate began its first regular member meeting in Chengdu on the 3rd. Speaker Jiang specially sent National Senate Secretary-General Wang Shijie to participate. The meeting was chaired by convener Shao Congen and continued on the 4th. On the morning of the 4th, advisors and members such as Li Boshen were also invited to attend, and the military and political leaders of Sichuan and Kang provinces and the heads of various offices in Sichuan Province were also invited. The items discussed at the meeting on the 3rd were the powers of each office of the Promotion Association and the work in the Sichuan-Kang construction plan that requires special attention. Regarding the former, resolutions were made on issues such as the division of the work area of each office, the administrative report, and the method of inspection and assessment, and the status and powers of the advisor members participating in the work of each office. The date for each office to start work will be determined by the director, but no later than the end of this month. Regarding the latter, it was believed that the work that should be given special attention in the current construction of Sichuan and Kang is security, opium suppression, and drug suppression. The remaining construction departments are still urging the government to step up the promotion. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Grain Storage</h3>
<p>Since the transition from summer to autumn, rice prices have repeatedly risen beyond limits to over forty yuan. Although the autumn harvest has now been completed, the price still hovers around thirty yuan. If rice prices are so high during the new harvest, what will happen in the lean months to come? For the sake of the people's future food supply, the Citizens' United Association has suggested to the concession authorities that rice storage is necessary.</p>
<p>Why is rice so expensive? Is it due to a poor harvest? Sichuan and Hunan have both reported bumper harvests. Is it only in the major rice-producing areas of the lower Yangtze River that there is a poor harvest? Is it due to wind damage? Late rice in western Zhejiang may have been stunted, but the early rice was not affected and the harvest was normal. Therefore, the high price of rice is not due to a poor harvest but to human manipulation. Since the Japanese army invaded China, where could there be food for millions of miles? China's food supply was already insufficient, and adding the consumption of these millions of people, plus the fact that they not only eat but also plunder, means that all agricultural products, whether for clothing or food, are subject to control in name but monopolized in reality if they can be used for profit. There are obstacles at every turn, difficulties piled upon difficulties, and exorbitant taxes levied. Therefore, rice is always cheaper in guerrilla areas and more expensive in occupied areas. Even the blocking of junks carrying rice from Fushan Port to German ships for transport to Shanghai, the forcing of vegetable boats to dock at wharves on the Hongkou side, and the scarcity of rice and wheat at the source all add to the burden on Shanghai's food supply. It is said that the amount of grain stored in Hongkou is very large, so the municipal market sells it at a fair price. Where does this rice come from? Is it not Chinese rice? In China, rice producers are not allowed to keep their rice, and those who depend on rice for food are reduced to starvation due to the high price. Sleeping in the open and exposed to the elements, they wander the streets, and can be seen at any time and anywhere on the streets of Shanghai. Is this not the so-called "warehouses full of rotten grain while the roads are filled with starving corpses"? In addition, there are those who act as accomplices, stirring up trouble and hoarding for profit, disregarding the people's hardships. Therefore, unless man-made obstacles are removed, rice prices will not be stabilized. Knowing this, the people of Shanghai want to stabilize their lives, which is not allowed by the current environment.</p>
<p>"Save money to prevent old age, save grain to prevent famine." This is true even in normal times, let alone today when one dan of rice is worth more than a hundred thousand yuan. If Shanghai can store a large amount of rice to regulate surpluses and deficits and stabilize grain prices, it will not only benefit the people's food supply but also the farmers. This is why the ever-normal granary system is praised by the world. However, what is being proposed now is to purchase and store grain during the new harvest to prepare for supplying food to the people in the future, which is different from the ever-normal granary system, but the intention of regulating and stabilizing is the same. The reason why Shanghai's grain market is not easily managed and merchants dare to hoard and manipulate is that the government only knows how to set price limits but does not prepare for the people's food supply! With preparation, when rice prices rise beyond limits this autumn, it can release its reserves, stabilize grain prices, and provide a steady supply, so that people's hearts are at ease, and rice merchants cannot hoard even if they want to, and dare not stop transporting even if they want to. Even if rice prices cannot be suppressed as low as usual, they will not be as expensive as today. This shows that storage is indispensable. However, grain storage has been an important part of famine relief policy in China for thousands of years, but it has rarely been successful, not because the law is not good, but because of the lack of technical equipment, which has made good policy a failure. Although the mainland is actively promoting it, it is still in the trial stage. Whether Shanghai's decision to store grain can be realized depends on the decision of the two concessions. Even if it becomes a reality, all technical problems should be left to experts to design, and some major concerns that should be anticipated may be discussed.</p>
<p>Grain storage, regardless of the amount of grain, must have its expenses. As far as Shanghai is concerned, is the amount stored enough to prepare for the food supply of all citizens for one month, or two months, or three months? If the amount of grain is not determined, the expenses cannot be calculated, but it must be known that the amount is not small, because of the large number of citizens in Shanghai. So where will the funds come from? Do the two concession authorities have savings similar to a famine relief fund? If there is no such fund, and you want to carry out grain storage, you will inevitably have to raise funds temporarily, which will waste time and miss the opportunity, and you do not know when it will be completed. I borrow from the banking industry, although the loan can be obtained, but it must not affect public welfare, and the entire loan can be exempt from interest, then the interest expense indirectly increases the cost of grain, this is one. The purchase of grain for storage must not cause the price of local grain to rise. Because there is something to buy, people also have something to ask for, so the purchase and storage of grain in the local area depends on taking advantage of the opportunity and using it well, otherwise, it will be used by others. If you purchase from the place of origin, according to the current situation, there are many obstacles; military and foreign rice, since the European war, there is no hope of export temporarily before the situation is clear. Therefore, the location and timing of purchase should also be considered, this is two. Grain storage must have warehouses, Shanghai still has no public granary, so it must be stored in commercial warehouses, and in general, warehouses, strictly speaking, are not suitable for grain storage, let alone, and the cost of warehouse rent cannot be saved at all. This is three. Store rice? Store grain? It is also a major problem in the history of storage. Rice is easy to turn red and rot, so ancient times stored grain. For example, Shanghai people eat rice in the summer, mostly using broken bran, broken bran is Chen Gu Xin Chun also. Storing grain occupies a large warehouse space, which does not seem suitable for Shanghai; storing rice is easy to deteriorate because of its soft body and bones and the fact that it is often adulterated with water; so how to find a common ground is appropriate, this is four. What's more, if rice is stored for a long time; it will be moldy, steamed, and eaten by insects, and there will be some loss; when it is sold, the loss of Shenghe is unavoidable, so if it is not for the purpose of making profits, how should the loss be compensated, this is five. All this said, if storing rice can indeed become a reality, it will only increase costs, even if it is passed on to consumers, it is lighter than the damage caused by rice merchants' manipulation. However, if the government has difficulty raising a large sum of money for a while, and storing rice cannot be realized for a while, although the new rice has just been harvested, the price of rice may still have a slight drop, but I am afraid that the price of rice will not be high, so wartime food is often managed, so as to prevent speculation from endangering people's livelihood, although it has no direct impact on the war zone but has an indirect relationship, such as British territories such as Hong Kong, also adopt a management system to prevent problems before they happen, which cannot be ignored. Now Shanghai has not yet escaped the state of war, has a population of millions, and the rice-producing areas around it have been occupied, and food regulation is even more difficult. In addition to implementing its passive price limit method, the concession authorities have not taken further measures. In the future, they should take more active and effective actions to stabilize the people's livelihood in the entire city of Shanghai, which is also to maintain the security of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although, the hidden worries about the future of the people's food are still deep, because the Japanese government has decided to import foreign rice in order to have a sufficient food supply next year, and is currently preparing for this matter, and said that the Japanese government has not transported foreign rice to Japan for six years, and it is heard that the first batch of affairs in the plan have been completed, this is the Tokyo telecommunications of Reuters on the first of this month. Why has Japan not imported foreign rice for six years, but is now eager to import it? The intention is precisely the result of Japan sending a large number of troops to invade China, just as Wells' prediction of the future world said, Japan because "the war made the fields in the country barren, and there was famine everywhere," coupled with the frequent typhoons this year, the damage to crops is inevitable, and it has to rely on foreign countries, this is one. Secondly, the Japanese-American trade is about to expire, and the clouds over the Pacific Ocean may clear or rain. Although the Japanese have the heart to serve the big powers and try to please the United States, they cannot be sure of a reconciliation. The three islands are suspended in the sea, and a blockade is feared, so they must prepare for grain storage in advance to prevent emergencies, this is two. Originally, Japan's rice supply was taken from the colonies, such as the rice produced in Korea and Taiwan, which has always been obtained by the Japanese. What the Koreans produce, the Koreans often cannot enjoy it, and the Koreans have nothing to eat, and turn to the millet and red sorghum in the three northeastern provinces to share what the Chinese eat. The so-called foreign rice refers to the rice from Rangoon and Saigon. With Japan's current financial strength, it lacks foreign exchange and has no ability to purchase a large amount of foreign rice. Even if it is bartered, since the outbreak of the European war, the colonies of various countries have strictly restricted the import of foreign goods, and Japan will have limited access to what it wants to obtain. So where will it import a large amount of foreign rice from? China. Since the Chinese army withdrew westward, the japonica rice in the north and the indica rice in Wuhu have been loaded and taken away by the Japanese, although the quantity cannot be statistically determined, it must be very large. Since this summer, it has become even worse. When they need it, they prohibit exports; when they don't need it, they lift the ban, and extort as usual. Therefore, Chinese rice production was originally supplied to the Chinese people, but now it only accounts for the Japanese's leftovers. If the Japanese step up the implementation of their foreign rice import policy in the future, the Chinese people's food will be even more unimaginable, because they will take whatever they want, and only ask for it from China! If this is the case, if the Chinese people have the determination to survive, then storage, whether public or private, should be prepared as early as possible. Even merchants and traders should be inspired by conscience and no longer use food as a tool for speculation and wealth, and not let the rice go and never return. If they must wait until the road to becoming a hungry ghost is not far away before they repent, it will be too late.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Major Victory: New Neutrality Act Passes House; Arms Embargo Clause Repealed; Spiritual Assistance Given to Britain and France</h3>
<p>Washington: In yesterday's House session, the Neutrality Act amendment passed by a vote of 243 to 180. This amendment repeals the arms embargo clause, allowing Britain and France to obtain arms from the United States under "cash and carry" terms. The Sino-Japanese conflict was a central topic in yesterday's debate. New York Republican Representative Wadsworth stated that applying this Neutrality Act to the Far East would strike a major blow to China and aid the aggressor. Therefore, this new Neutrality Act should not be implemented in the Far East. Wadsworth also said that the U.S. Neutrality Act during the Spanish Civil War and the Italo-Ethiopian War was an unfair act, the result of which only benefited the better-armed party. Pennsylvania Republican Representative Colburn, an opponent of the Neutrality Act amendment, said that the U.S. could not implement the Neutrality Act in both Europe and Asia. If it does, the result would only be to aid Britain, France, and Japan. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: When the House of Representatives voted to repeal the arms embargo clause yesterday, a total of 243 people voted in favor, including 220 Democratic representatives, 21 Republican representatives, and 2 independent representatives. Among the 181 who voted against, there were 36 Democratic representatives, 143 Republican representatives, and 2 Progressive representatives. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Political figures are now commenting on the House's vote to repeal the arms embargo clause, generally agreeing that the U.S.'s attitude and response to the current war are now clear to the world. It would not be an exaggeration to call this the most important political event since the outbreak of the European war. From now on, the Allied powers of Britain and France can freely purchase the arms they need from the United States, demonstrating that the principles they uphold have received spiritual support from the United States. The importance of this relationship is easily imagined. In short, after the repeal of the arms embargo clause, the current Neutrality Act is comparable to allowing American ships to enter war zones. It is also suitable to avoid disputes with European belligerents. President Roosevelt has truly achieved a victory, and there is no doubt that he is the most qualified spokesman for the United States. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Heated Debate in the House: Representatives Sympathetic to China; All Agree This Act Should Not Apply to the Far East</h3>
<p>Washington: The House convened at 11 a.m. today to debate the Neutrality Act. All members of the House were present, and the galleries were packed. Representatives delivered speeches one after another, their views remaining within established frameworks. Democratic Representative Rayburn said, "Those who do not know God will perish," and concluded by defending the personal freedom cherished by the American people and hoping to establish a peace based on Christian tenets to end the European war. After Rayburn's speech, most representatives applauded in agreement. Republican Representative Wadsworth then spoke, his tone calm but his words firm. He argued that if neutrality were legislated, it would prematurely define and constrain U.S. foreign policy, which would be inappropriate. Taking the Spanish Civil War as an example, General Franco's victory was aided by Italy, and the current U.S. Neutrality Act helped in this outcome. Regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict, the Neutrality Act was not implemented; otherwise, it would be detrimental to China. However, the Pittman Act recently passed by the Senate can provide greater safeguards under current circumstances, reducing the possibility of disputes between the United States and European belligerents, which is indeed the case. In short, if any European belligerent opposes the United States, it would invite defeat and gain nothing. In 1917, the German ambassador to the U.S. strongly advised the German authorities not to provoke the U.S., but his advice was not heeded. This can serve as a lesson from the past. Some say that after the amendment of the U.S. Neutrality Act, factories may be vandalized. One can answer this by saying that our laws should be respected by Congress and the government. Therefore, President Theodore Roosevelt once said, "Speak softly, but carry a big stick." How profound are his words! After Wadsworth's speech, Democratic and Republican representatives stood up and cheered enthusiastically for a long time. Speaker Bankhead then concluded the debate, briefly stating that according to international law, the United States has the right to supply arms to belligerents. Now that the arms embargo has been lifted, Britain and France will naturally benefit, which is also reasonable. Because Britain and France promote democracy, and their people enjoy freedom of thought and speech, American public opinion tends to favor those countries and oppose totalitarian states, and there are good reasons for this. At this point, the House submitted various motions for a vote, and the government won every time. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington: The House continued to discuss the issue of the existence or repeal of the arms embargo today. Democratic Representative Shanley proposed a motion arguing that when the joint committee of the House and Senate meets (the House passed the Neutrality Act in June of this year, maintaining the arms embargo, which conflicts with the Pittman Act recently passed by the Senate, so a joint committee must be organized to adjust it), the House representatives should try to maintain the embargo, banning the export of all kinds of arms and airplanes. Republican Representative Vorys then amended Shanley's motion, stating that commercial aircraft should still be exported. The House ultimately rejected Vorys's amendment by a vote of 244 to 179, and Shanley's amendment by a vote of 243 to 181. At this stage, it is evident that a majority in the House has decided to repeal the arms embargo. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Joint Committee Formed by Both Houses; Drafting Provisions for the Neutrality Act; Legal Sanctions for Saboteurs</h3>
<p>Washington: After the House of Representatives voted in favor of repealing the arms embargo, it is now appointing representatives to form a joint committee with Senate representatives to draft provisions for the new Neutrality Act. Then the two chambers will separately vote to approve it and make it law. Generally, these provisions will be largely the same as the Pittman Act passed by the Senate a few days ago, advocating for (1) repealing the arms embargo, (2) implementing cash and carry, and (3) restricting American shipping. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington: Attorney General Murphy recently made a statement to the press, stating that after the arms embargo is lifted, if saboteurs dare to intensify their acts of destruction, the Department of Justice will punish them. So far, several acts of sabotage have occurred, and FBI Director Hoover has also formulated concrete measures to protect industry and minimize acts of sabotage. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Satisfied; American-Made Arms and Aircraft; Large Quantities Awaiting Shipment to Europe</h3>
<p>London: Officials here today greatly welcomed the news of the U.S. House of Representatives repealing the arms embargo clause. Officials stated that the possible result of repealing the arms embargo clause is that the large quantities of arms and hundreds of land-based reconnaissance aircraft, fighter planes, light bombers, and airships awaiting shipment in New York and California can now be released. Regarding the German statement that "whether Britain and France can obtain arms from across the Atlantic remains to be seen," officials asserted that Britain and France have made arrangements to begin shipping immediately. It was indicated that airships will fly directly from the U.S. to Britain and France. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>Paris: People here expressed great satisfaction with the news of the U.S. House of Representatives' vote to repeal the arms embargo. "Le Petit Parisien" reported that this vote demonstrates American sympathy. America's valuable spiritual support will soon be augmented by material assistance, which will accelerate the victory of the Allies. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>New York: According to news here today, Britain and France ordered 1,500 aircraft from the U.S. a year ago, of which 600 were delivered before the outbreak of the European war. For example, of the 250 Lockheed bombers ordered by Britain, 120 have been delivered. Of the 400 North American Harvard trainers ordered by Britain, two-thirds have been delivered. However, Australia and Canada still have 65 bombers on order that have not been delivered. 200 Curtiss fighters have been delivered to France, while France has only received 50 of the 200 North American Harvard trainers. The aircraft that still need to be delivered to France include 215 Martin medium bombers and 20 Vought-Sikorsky bombers (40 have already been delivered). Furthermore, 88 aircraft that can be immediately shipped to Britain and France since the enactment of the U.S. Neutrality Act. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Concerned: Unable to Conceal Apprehension</h3>
<p>Berlin: A spokesman for the German Propaganda Ministry yesterday condemned the U.S. repeal of the arms embargo, stating that the action was "direct assistance to Britain and France." Both the Propaganda Ministry and the Foreign Ministry said that the repeal of the arms embargo was "not surprising and was expected." The Nazi Party believed that "whether Britain and France can obtain arms from across the Atlantic remains to be seen." (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Rome Observes: Significant Gains for Britain and France</h3>
<p>Rome: All morning newspapers here used large headlines to report the news of the U.S. House of Representatives repealing the arms embargo clause, and published editorials with extremely cautious language. They all said that only Britain and France would benefit from this move, but not Germany, and that the consequences of this move were extremely important, and would even have a decisive impact on the final course of the war. In addition, political figures do not underestimate the importance of the American move, considering it a major gain for the Allied powers of Britain and France, and a major victory for President Roosevelt personally. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Views on the Future World by a Prominent American Economist: China Can Compete with Japan; The Future Is Limitless</h3>
<p>Boston: According to prominent American economist Babson, who spoke to the Chamber of Commerce here today, "If the Great American Empire maintains its current organization, it is bound to collapse." The powerful countries of the future will definitely not be as numerous as they are now. "In the future, the countries with powerful armaments and the right to speak on world issues will be no more than four or five. Even if other countries are not annexed by these powerful countries, they will become protectorates of these powers. Therefore, according to the most natural laws of evolution, the powerful countries of the future will be, in Europe, no more than the Soviet Union, Germany, and Britain; in the Far East, either China or Japan; and in the Americas, the United States."

<h3>Italy and Greece; Exchange Documents Reaffirming Friendship; Declaring Continued Pursuit of Peaceful Policies; And Will Negotiate a Commercial Treaty with Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Rome: The governments of Italy and Greece exchanged notes on October 31, reaffirming their friendship. The Greek note stated, "The assurances provided by my government in its note to your government on October 12 are entirely in line with my country's feelings toward your country. Fortunately, a friendly environment has been created between our two countries. Subsequently, your Prime Minister Mussolini voluntarily withdrew troops stationed on the Albanian border with my country, which greatly moved my people, and they have great sympathy for Prime Minister Mussolini's efforts to maintain peace." The Italian government immediately replied, stating, "My country shares the sentiments expressed in the note and will continue to pursue peaceful policies. We deeply hope that under extreme mutual trust, a period of renewed friendship and understanding will be laid down between our two countries." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria: The Italian delegation has concluded commercial negotiations with the Bulgarian government here, and it is generally expected that this economic agreement will be signed today. It is hoped that a Swedish delegation will arrive here today to negotiate a new commercial agreement with Bulgaria. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<h3>The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; Declared Adjournment Yesterday; Approved the Merger of West Belarus</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held a joint session of the two chambers yesterday. Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Kalinin, and other government officials and members of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet were present. A special delegation from the People's Assembly of West Belarus, represented by member Prizhitsky, spoke, describing in detail the suffering of the people in the region under the rule of Polish magnates. He declared that they today unanimously wish to establish Soviet power in the country and join the Soviet Union to merge with the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. This wish has been fully expressed in the instructions given to the representatives of the People's Assembly during the election, and in the resolution of the People's Assembly on October 28. After Prizhitsky's speech, he presented the Supreme Soviet with the declaration of the People's Assembly requesting to join the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>After listening to the statement of the special delegation of West Belarus, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union hereby formally resolves as follows: (1) Accept the request of the People's Assembly of West Belarus, and allow West Belarus to join the Soviet Socialist Federation and merge with the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic; (2) Instruct the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to designate a date to elect deputies from the West Belarus region to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; (3) Authorize the Supreme Soviet of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic to incorporate the entire territory of West Belarus into the Republic; (4) Request the Supreme Soviet of the Belarusian Republic to formulate a draft for the division of the border region between the Belarusian Republic and the Ukrainian Republic, and submit it to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union for adjudication.</p>
<p>The above resolution was voted on separately by the two chambers, and the result was unanimous passage by the entire chamber. At that time, there was thunderous applause, and all deputies stood up and shouted Long live the Red Army, Long live Voroshilov, Long live the Soviet government and leader Molotov, Long live the leader of the entire Soviet people Stalin.</p>
<p>The fifth extraordinary session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was completed in cheers and adjourned. (TASS, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Hitler Receives; Italian Ambassador; German Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Visits Soviet Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Berlin: Hitler received German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen at his residence last night, talking for several hours. Mackensen will return to Rome within days. German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg will also arrive in Berlin today to meet with Hitler and return to Moscow in a few days. (Associated Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: The Daily Telegraph said today that the urgent recall of the German ambassadors to Italy and the Soviet Union to Berlin shows that Hitler is increasingly anxious about the policies of those countries. Germany now attaches great importance to Italy's consistent opposition to Bolshevism. It is reported that General Goering now intends to go to Rome in person to persuade Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to understand the new Soviet-German relations. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg yesterday met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, expressing the German government's gratitude for Molotov's speech at the Supreme Council on October 31. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<h3>German Overseas Trade; Almost Completely Severed; Thirteen Merchant Ships; Captured by Britain and France</h3>
<p>London: People here today commented on the plight of German merchant ships due to the war. It is said that in the 20 years after the World War, Germany built a huge merchant fleet, but it has now lost most of it. Those that remain are hardly able to continue maritime trade. 13 German merchant ships have been captured by the Allied navies, two of which were captured by the French navy. Eight others have been scuttled by their crews to avoid capture. German merchant ships sheltering in neutral ports are now trying to return to their home country. Although some of them may be able to use the territorial waters of neutral countries during the northern fog to quietly pass through the blockade line and return to their home ports, they will inevitably be captured. Another factor in the reduction of German merchant ships is the lack of currency, which forces German ships sheltering in neutral ports to sell part of their cargo to pay mooring fees. However, there will be a day when the cargo is sold out. At that time, the German ships will either be detained or have to sail out and be attacked by Allied warships. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Economic Warfare announced today that the Allies have now intercepted more than 500,000 tons of contraband suspected of being destined for Germany. Since the outbreak of the war, 87,500 tons of petroleum have been intercepted, including 12 million gallons of gasoline. The most intercepted goods to date are military raw materials, including large quantities of manganese, lead, and bauxite. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Churchill Visits; French Naval Minister</h3>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Declares: No Need to Explain War Aims; Establishing Peace Requires Restoring Confidence; Prepared to Consider Any Reasonable Proposals</h3>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax declared in the House of Lords today that the necessary foundation for establishing peace is trust. The trust that the current German government has destroyed must be restored, and it is the German people, and no one else, who can restore it. Therefore, Germans should consider how trust can be restored, not us. At this time, it is neither reasonable nor possible to first explain Britain's war aims, when or how they can be said to have been achieved, because no one can predict all the conditions that will exist at the time of the armistice. The state of Europe at the end of the war will depend on the duration and scope of the war. This is not just a problem for Britain alone, it is also related to the Allied governments and the Dominion governments. There will eventually be a day when peace conditions can be explained in more detail, and these peace conditions should be regarded as the realization of Britain's war intentions. Britain's first objective is to punish and defeat those who have repeatedly disrupted the European order and threatened freedom, which has forced us to fight. Men and women in Europe are not inherently averse to the opportunity to live a stable life. Even if the direction we are taking is distant, it is still correct, and since the people of our country are united to uphold the doctrines we believe in, we can certainly hope that the result will be in line with the beliefs of those who want a better new world where all countries coexist on the basis of equality, self-respect, and mutual tolerance. We should be prepared to consider any proposals that may bring people's hopes and aspirations closer to realization, but we should not abandon the work we have undertaken until we are sure that we can obtain conditions that guarantee the world from repeating the current tragedy. As for when these conditions can be obtained and how, we cannot accurately judge. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>British Empire Departments; Discuss Cooperation; Indian Troops Have Not Been Sent to France</h3>
<p>London: After the representatives of the various Dominions and India arrived here together, they began holding meetings with representatives of the British government yesterday. The main goal is to discuss intensifying cooperation and adjusting work. To achieve this goal, a permanent organization will be set up in London, composed of experts from the delegations of the various Dominions and India. The first issues to be studied are military, transportation, and supply, the most important three. The main purpose is to coordinate the work of the various parts of the Empire and strengthen the efforts of each part to move towards a common goal. In military terms, the issue of replenishing army personnel is extremely important, whether for the defense of the Dominions and India themselves, or for organizing an expeditionary force to participate in the war in Europe. Other issues, such as wartime industries, are complex and must be adjusted. In particular, the manufacturing of aircraft and the production of metal products should be developed. Canada and Australia have made significant progress in this area, which is satisfactory. As for aviation personnel, they must first receive preliminary training in the Dominions and then be sent to Canada for further study. In addition, various diplomatic and political issues and war aims will be reviewed by the representatives of the Dominions and India and the British government. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Information announced that the Canadian government recently held a meeting with officials from the provincial agriculture bureaus and members of the recently established agricultural committee to discuss the issue of supplying food to the Allied powers of Britain and France. Afterwards, a public announcement was made stating that the various provinces of Canada will make great efforts to intensify the production of various major foods to meet the needs of Britain and its allies. Based on this, the various foods needed by Britain during the war can be fully supplied. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>London: A semi-official source today denied the German broadcast that Indian troops had arrived in France. It is said that no Indian troops have been sent to France. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>If Germany Launches a Large-Scale Bombing of Britain; Britain Will Retaliate in Kind; Labour Party Member Warned Germany Yesterday; German Bomber Shot Down</h3>
<p>London: During a debate on civilian defense in the British House of Commons today, Labour MP Morrison spoke, predicting the possibility of Britain suffering a serious air raid, saying that enemy bombers may break through and cause serious damage. But Hitler must know that if this happens, it will cause a retaliatory action that is no less effective. If enemy planes come, our air defense forces will severely damage them. Even if some enemy planes break through, our country will deal with that country in the same way. No matter what the enemy does, the British people will not flinch. The enemy must know that this reckless action will cause Germany to suffer serious consequences. If today's war becomes a war of mutual destruction, it would truly be madness. Hitler and Goering must know that if they pursue a policy of destroying cities and people, we are also prepared. We will resist with all our strength and win the final victory. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Lille: A German bomber was discovered in the skies over Staple, near Hazebrouck in northeastern France, at noon today. It was pursued by two British fighters, and a battle immediately broke out at low altitude. Before long, the German plane was shot down, killing one pilot and injuring another. Two others were captured. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters issued its 120th war bulletin, stating, "Artillery battles occurred in certain areas of the front yesterday.

<h3>America Possesses Economic Weapons, Sufficient to Strike Japan – Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce Submits Oppression Situation, Requests Government Not to Negotiate Trade Treaty with Japan</h3>
<p>London – Neutral diplomats here suspect that the Washington government, after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty on January 26, 1940, will prepare to negotiate a new "Most Favored Nation" treaty with Japan, or impose prohibitive tariffs on Japanese goods imported into the United States. American importers, cotton producers, and exporters who currently supply Japan with kerosene, scrap iron, copper, and other goods will oppose any pressure on Japan. The expiration of the treaty will grant the Washington government economic weapons, which, although temporarily sheathed and unused, would be invincible if used well. American bankers here believe that the United States will possess a weapon to deter any Japanese plan to directly seize the Shanghai International Settlement from Wang Jingwei's control. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Washington – The Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the State Department, requesting the government to refuse to conclude a new commercial treaty with the Japanese government until Japan ceases its oppression of American business in North China. The telegram stated, "Although the United States has repeatedly protested to Japan, American merchants have not obtained satisfactory results, enabling American businesses to freely conduct private affairs and commerce without unnecessary obstruction." The Chamber of Commerce requested the government to lodge a more serious protest with the Tokyo government against the Japanese demand that American goods entering Japanese military barriers must obtain a pass, and against the Japanese authorities' refusal to reissue passes to American employees of American stores. The telegram also stated that American men and women residing in Tianjin, although holding passports and identification, are often subjected to Japanese inspection of their personal luggage. The Chamber of Commerce requested that the U.S. government must obtain satisfactory replies before negotiating a new commercial treaty with Japan. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Conspiracy in China to Create Puppet Regime – So-Called Asia Institute Plans Concrete Proposals</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Japanese government held a meeting of the Asia Institute on the 1st, deciding on new policies to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and held a cabinet meeting on the 2nd, approving the original proposal. Prime Minister Abe is scheduled to visit the Emperor at 11:00 AM tomorrow, and meet with Privy Council President Konoe at the Huaqiao Association Hall at 5:00 PM on the 2nd to explain the progress of the "New Central Government" movement in China and the specific plans of the Asia Institute to assist the new government. The two then exchanged important opinions until 6:30 PM. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Prime Minister Abe made a statement after his meeting with Konoe yesterday, saying that Konoe had a special relationship with handling the China Incident, so he met with him today to explain in detail the specific matters decided at the Asia Institute meeting on the 1st, and exchanged opinions. The Asia Institute will hold meetings once a week in the future to discuss the China issue. It is heard that the "New Central Government" movement in China is progressing smoothly, so it is not known whether the "New Government" will be realized this year. Furthermore, whether the negotiations to adjust relations with Britain and the United States will adopt the form of Anglo-Japanese Tokyo talks has not yet been decided. In short, it is currently necessary to carry out the work of adjusting U.S.-Japan relations. We do not know the true intentions of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech. Although he said that the Soviet Union is ready to conclude a trade treaty to adjust Soviet-Japanese relations, it seems to imply that the Japanese side should propose this matter first. However, we do not intend to ask the other party to make a proposal first on this issue. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>British Parliament Member Asks About Scope of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations – Undersecretary's Answer Evasive</h3>

<h3>Philippine Permanent Neutrality, Timing Not Ripe – Fourth Anniversary of Autonomy, Preparing Grand Celebrations</h3>
<p>Washington – Congressman and Chairman of the Island Affairs Committee, Cox, stated today, "Under the current international environment, it is inappropriate to establish an international treaty for the permanent neutrality of the Philippines." I have read Quezon's statements carefully and deeply understand that Quezon's views are far-sighted in planning for the long-term security of the Philippines, but considering the issue of a convention on permanent neutrality at present is close to impractical and unrealistic. Because in the current environment, no country is willing to sign this convention, and even if it is signed, no country is willing to respect it. Moreover, today the entire Far East is in the midst of gunfire, how can we talk about a convention on permanent neutralization? The effectiveness of a neutrality convention lies in the fact that the surrounding countries have no ambition and live in peace with each other. If there is a country that is constantly engaged in militarism, then the Philippines cannot expect it to respect its promises. Furthermore, according to news here, after the passage of the U.S. Neutrality Act, all the restrictions imposed on Filipinos and their ships under the Neutrality Act must also be borne by Filipinos. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Manila – Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon today issued a proclamation designating November 15th as the fourth anniversary of the Philippine Commonwealth.

<h3>Japanese Ship Officer Arrogant – Forces U.S. Customs Officer to Salute – U.S. Congressman Expresses Indignation</h3>
<p>Washington – U.S. Republican Congressman Crawford from Michigan yesterday submitted a resolution to the House of Representatives, requesting Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to report in detail to Congress on the matter of Japan requiring U.S. customs officials to salute Japanese naval officers before boarding Japanese warships berthed in Honolulu. It is said that news came from Honolulu last week stating that Japanese naval officers required U.S. customs officials to salute them, otherwise they would not be allowed to board the ship. Crawford stated, "If U.S. officials are forced to salute foreign officers in their own ports, then we must formulate new and strict regulations regarding that port at this time." He will submit a bill on that regulation to this special session of Congress after the Neutrality Act is submitted for discussion. (Associated Press dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3>Soviet Pravda Harshly Criticizes Finland – Also Refutes Sweden</h3>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet government's official newspaper, Pravda, today published a significant commentary stating that the Finnish government has adopted some emergency measures that are only applicable to countries preparing for war. Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko, on the day after Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech, also delivered a speech, the content of which was no different from declaring readiness to fight the Soviet Union. Erkko directly threatened the Soviet Union, saying that he knew what forces Finland could rely on to protect its neutrality and independence when its security was threatened. The attitude of the Finnish Foreign Minister is quite similar to that of former Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. The war between Poland and Germany was caused by the provocative speech made by Beck. The Soviet Union has to take measures to ensure the safety of the sea and land routes to Leningrad, which has an equivalent population to Finland. Finland cannot ignore this right and interest. We can understand the Soviet Union's security issues by looking at a map, as the area bordering Finland is the most critical. Because the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland are entering the final stage, Pravda's commentary can be regarded as the Soviet Union's attempt to eliminate third-country interference, especially paying attention to the Scandinavian countries, especially Sweden. It is said that some politicians in that country are playing false tricks. Pravda refuted the claim made by various Swedish countries that if Finland cedes a naval base to the Soviet Union, it will endanger the security of the Scandinavian countries. In the past, imperial Russia completely occupied Finland and the Aland Islands, and Sweden was flattering it. Today, the Soviet Union is asking to obtain a naval base at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland, and Sweden is making a big fuss. Why is it so respectful before and so arrogant later? Pravda also said that the false tricks played by Swedish politicians were ordered by Western masters. According to Pravda, the Western masters clearly refer to Britain and France. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>Moscow – The Communist Party's organ, Pravda, took the opportunity of the Finnish delegation's third visit here to publish an editorial, fiercely criticizing Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko, saying that he stirred up war between Finland and the Soviet Union, and that the Finnish government also allowed itself to be manipulated by Western European masters. "We do not take politicians who know how to play cards, we can only move forward along the predetermined route, without any consideration, and we must smash all obstacles to ensure our country's safety." After Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech, explaining in detail the situation of the negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union, Erkko also delivered a speech the next day, the content of which was no different from provoking the Soviet Union. The various proposals we put forward before were aimed at strengthening friendship, but Foreign Minister Erkko referred to them as "endangering Finland's sovereignty" and even directly threatened the Soviet Union. This kind of provocation is exactly the same as the speeches repeatedly made by former Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, which led to Poland's destruction. As for the attitude of Sweden, the politicians of that country also follow the orders of their Western masters. Some Western countries are against the Soviet Union's security in the Gulf of Finland, which is strange. In the past, during the imperial Russian era, all the naval bases in Finland belonged to Russia, and we never heard any protests from the Swedes. Now, the Soviet Union is only asking to set up a naval base in Finland, why are the Swedes so verbose? On the other hand, all Soviet observers believe that Britain and France are not actually concerned about the Finnish issue, and that their neutral attitude is at least equal to the neutral attitude taken by the Soviet Union towards the current war in Europe. In other words, Britain and France have no military interests in Finland. The Soviet government's true intention is to take advantage of Germany's involvement in other matters to consolidate the interests it has gained in the countries along the Baltic Sea. The only country that can threaten the Soviet Union in the Baltic Sea is Germany. However, because the Soviet Union currently maintains "friendship" with Germany, it is not convenient to say so explicitly. This is to ensure security against the threat from that country, so it criticizes Finland and Sweden for their so-called "masters." As for Pravda's statement that the Soviet Union is determined to smash all obstacles to achieve its goals, it seems to be a real situation. In this way, Finland has already entered a critical juncture and must make concessions on certain basic points. The Finnish delegation has scheduled to continue talks with the Soviet authorities this afternoon. How the relationship between the two sides will evolve can be seen in a short period of time.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Issues Report on Battle Situation for One Week (Continued) – October 25th to 31st</h3>
<p>Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi Area – After days of fierce attacks by the Chinese army in southern Hubei, one route counterattacked into Jinniuzhen, northeast of Xianning, killing many Japanese; one route eliminated the remaining Japanese at Chibakou and Zhamuqiao; the Japanese entrenched at Bailuoji stubbornly resisted, and hundreds were killed by the Chinese; another route ambushed the Japanese transportation unit at Yanglousi, killing over a hundred Japanese. Along the Qian River north of Xinqiang in northern Hunan, there have been fierce battles for days. On the 27th, the Japanese at Qingyigang once attacked the Chinese, and after being repelled, the Chinese coordinated with the main force to launch fierce attacks on Xinkaitang and Guozhenshi south of Yueyang from the east and west, seizing many spoils. The vanguard also bypassed Kangwangmiao and other places in the suburbs of Yueyang. Another unit of the Chinese army recaptured Zhongfang on the 26th. The Japanese army trapped in Yueyang is now heavily surrounded and very panicked. The Japanese in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, have launched large-scale attacks on the Chinese in several routes for days. The Chinese used new tactics to counterattack them. After days of fierce fighting, the Japanese army gained nothing and is still in battle. As for the Chinese army west of Fengxin, it recaptured Nanliyu on the afternoon of the 29th, killing over seven hundred Japanese. The Chinese army attacking Wuning cleared the remaining Japanese at Baijiaogang on the 27th, and recaptured the strongholds of Lunshang and Baiheping on the morning of the 29th, continuing to advance. It once attacked the North Gate. Now it has surrounded the county town on all sides, and the Japanese seem to be collapsing.</p>
<p>Guangdong Area – The Xijiang battle has been more intense in the past week, but it has always been deadlocked near Jianghui. Near Huicheng and Jiangmen, the Japanese positions were repeatedly stormed by the Chinese, killing many Japanese. The Japanese repeatedly decided to reinforce, advancing along the Xinkai and Xinhe roads towards Shikangshan, Duruan, Zhonghexing, and Dashanding, but were repelled by the Chinese. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to advance and repeatedly captured strongholds such as Xiaomeishan, and once besieged Jitang. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. Currently, the Chinese army still attacks from time to time. The Japanese in Jiangmen and Xinhui are extremely panicked. The Japanese in Sanshui have been attacked by the Chinese for days, and once stormed into the city, destroying many Japanese barracks. On the 29th, Liangjia in Jiujiang was also stormed by the Chinese army, and the Japanese ammunition depot was completely destroyed. They also repeatedly ambushed the Japanese army in Qirenling and Yinjue. On the 24th and 25th alone, over two hundred Japanese, including the company commander Nan Sha and platoon leader Shan Fei, were killed. The Japanese in Shilong, Dongjiang, were besieged by the Chinese for days, suffering heavy casualties. They once broke through, but were severely attacked by the Chinese, abandoning over a hundred bodies and collapsing. Two thousand Japanese in Chaozhou and Shantou invaded Chenghai County. The Chinese army mobilized reinforcements and launched a large-scale counterattack. The Japanese army was unable to resist and collapsed towards the southwest. Chenghai was immediately recaptured. Post-war matters are now being handled, and the people are being comforted. In addition, in Suiyuan, the Japanese who invaded Baotou were defeated, killing over four hundred Japanese and destroying four Japanese cars. In northern Jiangsu, Cheqiao Town, which belongs to Huaian, was captured, approaching the county town. In Jiangnan, the Japanese who attacked Jiangyin, Wuxi, and Wujin were killed by over three hundred. In southern Anhui, Yangbing and Wutianpu were recovered. In western Zhejiang, Chongde was besieged and Xiqiao was recovered. These are all important battle results in the past week, and are specially reported here. (Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>General Overview of the Recent Battle Situation in Guangdong Province – Japanese Army Attacks in Northern Guangdong Unsuccessful – Battle Situation in Western Guangdong Has Been Quiet for a Long Time – Chinese Army in Eastern Guangdong Gains Initiative</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The Japanese army invading various parts of Guangzhou has been unsuccessful for a year. Although reinforcements have been added more than ten times, they have not yet compensated for their losses. In early October, the Japanese army in northern Guangdong gathered more than 3,000 people, aided by mechanized units and cavalry, and spied north from Huaxian and Conghua in separate routes. One route from Huaxian took the route through Qiganling and other places, invading Pajangkou, which belongs to Qingyuan, intending to attack Yingde along the southern section of the Yuehan Railway. One route from Conghua took the northwest route from Jiekou, attempting to attack Fogang and reach Wengyuan. The Chinese army blocked and attacked in several routes. On the railway line, the two armies fought fiercely near Pajangkou for three days and nights. The Japanese army eventually retreated because of the long and arduous expedition and inability to sustain it. When retreating, they were also ambushed by local militias, almost leading to the annihilation of the entire division. The remnants were able to escape back to Huaxian in fear. The Japanese army in Conghua, due to the defeat in the Pajangkou campaign, did not dare to go deep and retreated south, suffering heavy losses. At present, the Japanese army in northern Guangdong only defends Hengtan and Xinjie in Huaxian on the front, mutually supporting each other. In Conghua, they occupy Shengang Taipingchang to connect with Zengcheng in Dongqian. In the past week, the two sides have been in a stalemate in Shengang, Hengtan, Xinjie, and the suburbs of Zengcheng. The Chinese army wins slightly and retreats, no longer going deep, to tire the Japanese soldiers. Yesterday, 10,000 puppet troops were deployed to Guangzhou, with 2,000 sent to Xijiang, 1,000 to Conghua, and the rest to Qiongya, Jiangmen, Chaozhou, and other places. However, 10,000 people are distributed across a vast battlefield, and their strength has not been significantly increased.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Xijiang is estimated to be about 4,000 to 5,000 people, with complex components. Most of them are from the Northeast, one-third are locally recruited, and the number of regular Japanese soldiers is limited, but all the artillery are Japanese. The purpose of the Japanese army stationed in Xijiang is to break out of Sanhsui and Lubaou to meet the Japanese army in Xinjie and Gaotang in northern Guangdong, and jointly attack Qingyuan. Most of their main force is also deployed on the Lubaou West Road line. Due to the dangerous terrain and the lack of morale, they have attacked Lubaou along the Lubaou West Road dozens of times, but have not achieved any success. The Japanese army in the old Sanhsui area of Makou only adopts a defensive posture, setting up artillery positions to prevent the Chinese army from Sihui from crossing the river and attacking. The Sanshui River surface is only suitable for Japanese shallow-water warships to dock. In winter, the water is shallow, making it difficult to sail upstream. Although dozens of Japanese gunboats are gathered, they have been repelled by the Chinese army on both sides of the Xijiang River when they repeatedly probed. The two mountains of Xiaokou and Zhaoqing stand opposite each other, making it even more difficult for Japanese ships and warships to fly across. Therefore, the battle on the front of the Xijiang River has been quiet for a long time.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army reoccupied Shenzhen in the east, not long after, the European War broke out. The Japanese army feared friction with the British army in Kowloon, so they withdrew their troops one after another. Therefore, the traffic between Kowloon, the New Territories, and Huizhou was restored instantly. Currently, ships traveling from Kowloon Dabu to Shayuchong in Huizhou are sailing as usual. Taking a detour from Hong Kong to Huiyang, leaving the Dongjiang River source, you can directly reach Xingning. From Xingning, you can take a car to Meixian, turn into the North River, and reach Kunming. Shenzhen, which connects Kowloon to the mainland, has recently been fortified by the Japanese army, with bunkers and fortifications built. A certain unit of the Chinese army once launched a surprise attack on Nantou in Shenzhen with a brigade, and once stormed into Shenzhen. However, due to the lack of air force support, they retreated immediately. Currently, Shenzhen is still in the hands of the Japanese army, but the Chinese army controls the middle section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, controlling Baoan in the south and Dongguan in the north. The Japanese army has not been able to occupy the entire Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line. On the contrary, the Chinese army has already gained the initiative.</p>
<h3>Suzhou City, Active Chinese Plainclothes Teams, Abducting Pseudo-Official Sun Zhuoren, Japanese Troops Close City Gates for Search</h3>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: Chinese troops in the four suburban areas of this county are constantly advancing towards the urban districts. A portion of the Chinese troops has already infiltrated the city, awaiting opportunities to act. Around 8 a.m. on the 24th, three Chinese soldiers, disguised as civilians in blue and azure robes, went to the Second District Public Office of the pseudo-Wuxian County, requesting to see the pseudo-director Zhou Xiangjun. Since Zhou was out, they turned to request to see the deputy Hua affairs officer Sun Zhuoren (Sun was the Education Commissioner of Wuxian County before the incident). At that time, Sun had just arrived at the pseudo-office from home. The three disguised Chinese soldiers, recognizing the person entering as Sun himself, drew out handguns, and kidnapped Sun westward towards Changmen. The officials inside the pseudo-office were terrified at the sight, fleeing in all directions. Only after the three disguised Chinese soldiers had gone far away did they urgently report to the pseudo-county government, police bureau, and Japanese military police branch, requesting rescue. However, it was too late. Half an hour after the incident, the Japanese troops tightly closed the city gates, conducting a rigorous search, but with no results. This caused a group of pseudo-officials to become uneasy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chinese mobile unit stationed outside Qimen in this county launched from Likou late at night on the 21st, advancing towards Lumuzhen, six *li* from the city. They arrived at the town around 1 a.m. that night. However, because the pseudo-army had fled upon hearing the news, they only destroyed the pseudo-police station and captured one resisting pseudo-police chief. The Chinese troops then safely retreated to their original defense positions at dawn the next day.</p>
<h3>Changshu Pseudo-Tax Officer Xie Shensan Beheaded</h3>
<p>Changshu Dispatch: Xie Shensan, who lived on Zhuhang Street outside the Xiaodongmen in the city, was a scrivener before the war, with a very cunning nature. After the war, he was appointed by the pseudo-Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Changshu Unified Tax Bureau to handle the pseudo-taxes of Shazhou, setting up a pseudo-tax branch at Shierweigang. Xie served as the pseudo-director for several months, collecting a large amount of revenue through his exploitative methods. A few days ago, he and his friend He went to Luyuan to return to the city by boat. On the way, they were advised by two people not to go to Luyuan, so they changed to Xinzhuanggang. Unexpectedly, Xie was detained there by several people stationed in that area, and imprisoned in a room. The next morning, he was taken to the fields and beheaded, his body cut into three pieces. His friend He, after being interrogated and found to be a cotton merchant with no connection, was immediately released.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Japanese and Puppets Forcibly Compel Owners to Build Houses, Designing to Gloss Over the Situation, Few Respond</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Dispatch: When this city was invaded by the Japanese army the year before last, the main streets in the east and west and the bustling areas outside the north gate were all burned down. The broken walls and ruins have not yet been restored to their former appearance. Most of the homeowners are wandering outside, unwilling to return. Seeing this desolate scene, the Japanese, in order to gloss over the situation, once urged the pseudo-magistrate He Peixuan to recruit refugees and rebuild houses. For a year, it has been difficult to make this a reality. The Japanese military intelligence unit then allocated 10,000 yuan, ordering the pseudo-county government, in the name of revitalizing the city appearance, to provide interest-free loans to the owners of businesses on the east and west main streets to build facade houses first, from the Zhongshan Road intersection on the west main street to the Gaoxiangkou on the east main street. All business owners were required to rebuild within November. If they lacked construction funds, they could borrow them, with a limit of 80 yuan per shop front. If they did not build within the deadline, the pseudo-county government would handle it, forcing construction. The borrowed funds would be repaid in four installments, with three months as one period, and one-quarter of the borrowed funds repaid each period. However, the first period could be extended by two months. After this law was promulgated, the few people in the city paid no attention to it. The Japanese and puppets' attempt to gloss over the situation only revealed their futile efforts.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Counterattacks Changxing, Recaptures the County Seat Again</h3>
<p>Changxing Dispatch: The Jiangnan Advance Team, together with the Wang Unit of the Mopanshan Chinese Army, counterattacked Changxing from three routes the day before yesterday. At the same time, the Guangde Chinese Army advanced along the Changsi Highway. The Japanese army in Changxing was attacked from both sides, suffering heavy casualties. Changxing was then recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese camp on Daxijie in Changxing city and the ammunition depot were completely burned down by the Chinese army. The pseudo-police chief Qin Xinzhi, pseudo-finance section chief Shen Chunshan, pseudo-education bureau chief Dong Siruo, and pseudo-magistrate Lu Zhongyu have fled, but are being wanted by the Chinese army with rewards. The Wu-Chang Highway is an important route connecting Tongxiang and Wuxing, and has now been destroyed by the Chinese army. However, Changyi is a famous mining area. Over the past year, the Japanese have enticed miners to dig in large and small coal mines, and half of the coal mined is shipped to Japan, a considerable amount.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Provinces and Cities to Pay Special Attention to Social Education and Broadly Raise Funds to Expand</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 3rd) The Ministry of Education believes that social education is an important task for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. Provinces and cities should pay special attention to it and expand it vigorously. However, to seek the development of undertakings, it is necessary to rely on the broad raising of funds. Social education funds should account for 10 to 20 percent of the total education expenses. As for provinces and cities that have already reached this standard, the proportion of social education funds in the newly added education expenses should be 30 percent in provinces and cities, and 30 to 50 percent in counties. However, this year, some provinces and cities have been able to raise funds in accordance with regulations, while others have not met the standards. As the Ministry of Education is about to end this fiscal year and the 29th fiscal year is about to begin, it reiterates the previous order, requiring all provinces and cities to effectively increase funding for social education when preparing the budget for the 29th fiscal year, especially for adult out-of-school popular supplementary education. Those provinces and cities that have not reached the stipulated standards must reach the 20 percent stipulation, and those that have complied with the regulations should still be appropriately increased. The newly added education funds should also be disbursed in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Ministry of Education, so that social undertakings can have considerable progress.</p>
<h3>Visiting the Second Refugee School of the Refugee Relief Association, Refugees Benefit Greatly from Education and Nurturing</h3>
<p>— Qian Yiming</p>
<p>The Second Refugee Children's School, established by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, is a leader among refugee schools. The school is located in the fruit section of the Association's Second Shelter on Yanping Road. Outside the school is a wide road, adjacent to the scenic Jiaozhou Park. The tranquility of the environment and the freshness of the air can be imagined. The school's facilities are very simple, and the classrooms are all made of thatched sheds, but the spiritual aspect is full of energetic atmosphere. The classroom area is about half an *mu*, built into a long, unified large room. Inside the classroom, there are movable curtains. During class, the curtains are used to divide the room into eight classrooms. Students enter and exit in an orderly manner. Whenever there is a meeting, all the curtains in the classroom can be folded up, and it can immediately become a very spacious auditorium. This economical method of serving two purposes with one effort is truly worthy of emulation and adoption. The layout of the classroom, in addition to the blackboard and desks and chairs, also includes the posting of civic training slogans and the hanging of Sun Yat-sen's portrait on the surrounding walls. Every Monday, a ceremony commemorating Sun Yat-sen is also held, which is the morning meeting, and is handled very seriously.</p>
<p>The school's primary school department is divided into five grades, and the kindergarten is divided into two grades. The total number of students is over 800. The textbooks used are the same as those in ordinary schools. Recently, in order to encourage refugee children to enroll, the Association has, in addition to providing extra food to the children who receive education, also examined the performance of outstanding students and rewarded them with practical items such as hats, shoes, clothes, socks, and towels. Therefore, these children are all smiling every day, very happy, and willing to go to school. The number of kindergarteners is no less than a hundred, with two teachers responsible for them. This group of budding, babbling infants can be said to have been born at the wrong time, suffering the pain of displacement with their parents in this great era. In a wandering life, to be able to have the opportunity to study in such a temporary resting place is indeed a matter worthy of celebration. The curriculum of the kindergarten is the same as ordinary ones, and there is also a supply of meals, one packet of bean flour per person per day. The extracurricular activity area is Jiaozhou Park next door. In addition, there are adult education facilities at night, the purpose of which is to eliminate illiteracy and encourage adult refugees to take advantage of their spare time to study. It is divided into four classes for men and women, high and elementary, with about 100 students. Teaching is carried out according to academic ability, using textbooks in addition to the Thousand Character Classic set by the Association, and also using teachers' own compiled lecture notes and loose-leaf anthologies to meet their needs. Educational films and slides are also shown every Wednesday to attract the interest of adult learners, and to select those refugee children with better grades to implement "Little Teacher Training" to help teachers when teaching adults of unequal levels.</p>
<p>The school has a total of 18 teachers, half men and half women. In terms of qualifications, they are all graduates of universities and normal high schools, with rich experience. Although the general teachers are working day and night under very difficult conditions, their expressions show that they not only do not feel any dissatisfaction with the lack of material and living enjoyment, but each is very energetic, working hard and very diligently. All the facilities of the school are diligently managed by Mr. Chen Heqin and Chen Xianmo, so that they can achieve such satisfactory results, which is the source of the teachers' efforts. Principal Zhang Jing is an intelligent and capable educator. In addition to accompanying the reporter to visit the school, he also talked about the future improvement plan of refugee education, which was very exciting. Although there was only two hours of visiting and talking time, the impressions were numerous. I will return to drafting this article, so that the general public can care about the reference of the refugee education.</p>
<h3>In-Service Training After Work, Library Opens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that school-style remedial education is not sufficient to meet the needs of the majority of young people in society, the In-Service Training After-Work Remedial School and the China Library Service, located at No. 486 Nanjing Road, have established the In-Service Training After-Work Circulating Library to make it public to the society. After several months of preparation, it has been completed, and it is scheduled to officially open at 3 pm on November 5. The opening ceremony will be presided over by Wei Pengdan, the chairman of the school's board of directors. From the 6th, the lending of books will begin, and public reading will be available. The library has collected more than 5,000 books and 60 to 70 newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>Education Briefs</p>
<p>The Ciyou Cultivation Institute run by the China Child Welfare Association has increased its number of students to 150, with monthly expenses of 1,600 yuan.</p>
<p>The 80 graduates of the Zhejiang Provincial Financial Personnel Training Institute have been distributed by the Provincial Department of Finance to various counties for internships.</p>
<p>Because schools and universities have already started this semester, the Ministry of Education has suspended the registration of students from specialist schools and above in war zones from now on.</p>

<h3>Wang Wenzheng and Carson Prepare to Face Philippine Players. The Order Is Temporarily Arranged for Two Singles Exhibition Matches at the French Chamber of Commerce at 2 PM on the 7th.</h3>
<p>Philippine Davis Cup players Sanchez and Ampon returned home on the American Coolidge liner and will pass through Shanghai next Tuesday (7th). The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club specially telegraphed to invite Sanchez and Ampon to perform here for the second time. Sanchez and others have agreed. Yesterday, a notice was received from Mr. Spick, secretary of the Lawn Tennis Club. As the ship is expected to arrive on the morning of that day, the Philippine players will be temporarily scheduled to play two singles exhibition matches with famous local players. Wang Wenzheng vs. Sanchez, Carson vs. Ampon, will face off at the club's court on Xiafei Road at 2 pm. Tickets will be sold for one yuan each. If time permits, both matches will adopt a best-of-five-set system. However, this order may be subject to change. Although Ampon is ranked below Sanchez, he has made rapid progress in his tennis skills by playing against world-renowned players Riggs, Brown, and Quist in the United States. During the Davis Cup match between the Philippines and Australia, he and Brown and Quist were under pressure. Although both were defeated in straight sets, they created close scores of 6-8 and 5-7. When he met Riggs during the Linsen Games, he actually forced the world champion to win in four sets. At the Pacific Coast Championships, he even won one set against Li Guang, and was eventually eliminated with a score of 2-6, 6-0, 2-6. Carson, who has been dominating Shanghai for many years, will definitely have many exciting moments against him. Wang Wenzheng is a leader among Chinese players, and has the general idea of being supreme in Shanghai except for Carson. Now that he meets Sanchez, who Carson once suffered from, even if he cannot win, he should pose a considerable threat. The order is as follows: Sanchez - Wang Wenzheng (2 pm) Ampon - Carson (after the first match) Ms. Wang Guangmei, a rising star of the Women's YMCA table tennis team, is a proud student of Mr. Chen Linsheng, the table tennis instructor of the Women's YMCA. Ms. Wang is also proficient in volleyball and is a star player on the Fudan team.</p>

<h3>Finance Overseas Capital Inflow, Foreign Exchange Positions Increasingly Abundant</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC listing showed no changes. The informal market for British and American currencies continued to move towards relaxation, breaking the previous record of 5 pence 34375 shillings on the 30th of last month, and creating a recent new relaxed price of 5 pence 35375 shillings. This is because the position is abundant, which is completely different from the past. The consolidation of the legal currency's credit has also deeply penetrated the minds of speculators, who all know that collecting foreign exchange now is definitely not a profitable plan. On the contrary, they are willing to take the opportunity to settle as soon as possible, so the relaxed trend is not easy to reverse. The source of selling pressure is mostly from foreign telegrams, indicating that domestic finance is stable, so capital is flowing back to Shanghai. Regarding today's trading situation, the Hong Kong banks, American banks, and Japanese banks competed to sell, reaching 5 pence 3125 shillings and 8.875 yuan. Subsequently, HSBC eagerly absorbed, and yarn shops and foreign firms bought in (one said they settled 150,000 US dollars), returning to 5 pence 25 shillings and 8.75 yuan. By the afternoon, buyers disappeared, and the selling wind revived, directly strengthening to 5 pence 359375 shillings for British gold and 8.9375 yuan for US dollars. Later, Japanese banks and major foreign firms took the opportunity to buy heavily, and the price only softened slightly. As a result of the closing, British gold was still 5 pence 34375 shillings, and the US dollar was 8.90625 yuan, compared to the previous day, British relaxed by 125, US strengthened by 21875.

However, soon Hong Kong telegrams and Japanese banks came to sell again, and Hua Bi and a certain bank also came to sell, in addition HSBC stopped absorbing, and others rarely had an appetite, so the situation returned to a relaxed and hard state.

Later, British gold once shouted the hardest at 5 pence 359375 shillings.

<h3>Gold Prices Did Not Fall Wildly, Hong Kong Banks Eagerly Bought In, Sellers Hesitated</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash market situation was unpredictable. Although foreign exchange has frequently relaxed, the result was only a slight suppression of more than 20 yuan. Therefore, if foreign exchange rebounds slightly, the buying wind will definitely rise greatly. Today, it seems that people's hearts have turned better. In addition to the Hong Kong banks' consistent buying, local banks also bought a lot, and sellers hesitated, and supply and demand could still cope. The morning opening was 3,630 yuan, 14 yuan less than the previous day. This was because the exchange market reported relaxation, followed by securities firms and gold shops buying on behalf of customers, rising sharply to 3,650 yuan. However, because foreign exchange finally hardened, money exchange firms sold slightly and then returned. Before the close, due to the exchange rate returning to flat, the buying wind continued, reaching a high of 3,658 yuan. However, the close suddenly dropped to 3,625 yuan.

Subsequently, as fewer people entered, money exchange firms and jewelry firms continued to sell, plus foreign exchange was still easing, gradually falling by 30 yuan. Jewelry firms sold 30 taels to gold shops, for 3,620 yuan. At that time, money exchange firms came to re-enter slightly, but cash shops still had the intention to supply, so the market situation once hovered between 3,620 and 30 yuan. Until about 11 o'clock, foreign exchange suddenly reported a soft return, which stirred people's hearts. A certain gold shop tended to absorb, and retail investors also followed suit to buy, and soon it rose to 3,658 yuan.

<h3>Miscellaneous Lychees Transported and Sold to Wen Tai, Raw Starch Arrivals and Stocks Both Prosperous</h3>

Compared with the Shanghai price, after deducting all foreign fees, it should be about 10 to 20 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of raw starch has been arriving continuously recently, and the stock is still abundant, but the sale is relatively stagnant. It has now seen a decline, such as Flying Kylin for 38 yuan, 3X mark for 37 yuan, GK mark for 37 yuan, double T mark for 35 yuan, and triple T mark for 29 yuan, a drop of 2 to 3 yuan compared to the previous.</p>
<h3>Securities Foreign Debt Continued to Rise, Up More Than Ten Pounds for Three Consecutive Days, Domestic Debt Conversely Formed Uncertainty</h3>
<p>London, 2nd - Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt continue to rise. Salt tax guaranteed bonds have the sharpest rise. The upper-end British-French loans (British issue) surged 7 pounds to 45 pounds, the British-German continuation (British issue) continued to rise 4 pounds to 51 pounds, and Post-War (British issue) continued to rise 3 and a half pounds to 38 and a half pounds.

<p>The informal market situation for securities, due to the appearance of many parties and the enthusiasm of selling, is gradually trending downward. There are no major changes in environmental news, but the Xiang war is about to restart, and rumors have started in a certain place again, causing panic among many parties. When many parties appeared, speculators took advantage of the momentum to sell, and market prices became more unsustainable. The lineup has brewed into a situation where most of the bulls in the field have sold out, and most of the bulls have fallen into the hands of customers. When the retail bull's cut is about to end, there will be a turning point, because the atmosphere of peace is still between there and not there. Yesterday's experience, at the beginning, the price increase by many parties was slightly higher, but it was obviously weak and the price increase was the place to exit, and those who shorted felt more and more that there was something to rely on. For example, the continuous requests for sale from Nos. 11 and Tongkang et al., the market atmosphere turned into a sluggish image, and the afternoon was even worse. Nos. 11, Tongkang, Shengsheng, Da Lianhe et al. all sold out, and Defu Tiansheng covered, but the supply still exceeded the demand. Category B quickly broke the 50 yuan mark, and Category A also broke the 8 yuan mark. The trend is still unstable, and the market price ended up falling by 3 to 6 jiao. The total number of transactions was more than 70,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market in the Public Industry Association was relatively quiet, but the underlying trend was still very strong. Several stocks regained the high prices of the previous day, but at these prices, there were many sellers. The stocks of various trust companies still occupied a prominent position, followed by Ruirong shares and China Reclamation shares. Rubber shares were firm as before.</p>
<h3>Yarn Spinning Production Overcapacity, Yarn Market Turned Down Sharply, Many Domestic Households Exited, Double Horse Fell 17 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been hovering the previous day, turned downstream today, and the monthly decline was even more intense. In fact, the exchange rate hovered and became more and more relaxed. At the same time, guest banks' appetites were not smooth. Although Hong Kong banks had purchased in the past, they were restricted by finance, and there was no huge purchasing power at all. As a result, once business stopped, the market immediately turned downward. The general trend of rushing sentiment, in view of the trend, was disheartened. Once the situation was tired, the decline became more intense. In summary, the inventory position increased, and consumption and production could not be balanced. In addition, the wealthy hoarders, seeing that all things are falling at present, had no intention of making large-scale hoarding movements. Some even spit out. On this basis, it is still in a state of hovering.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened slightly tired in the morning. Colleagues started to trade with each other. The spot price of 20-count double horse fell by 1 yuan to 653 yuan, with 20 bales traded. Subsequently, Guangbang arrived in the city and gathered, with no news of handling goods. At the same time, the exchange rate was listed and continued to rise, and the selling air suddenly rose, the selling sound constitutional vibration, and the market price fell step by step, falling to 640 yuan at the close. Later, it broke the 40 yuan mark, for 637 yuan. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics were 812 bales, and the market price of 20-count double horse fell by 17 yuan, Tiannv fell by 11 yuan, and double earth fell by 13 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Colleagues 450 Jiangxi 30</p>
<p>Hong Kong 65 Ningbo 27</p>
<p>Wenzhou 20 Previous Day's Transaction 220</p>
<p>Statistics 810</p>
<p>White Package Flowers Still Open</p>
<p>The cotton transaction is entirely a transaction between colleagues, all white package flower business, other cotton is not operated at all. However, Chinese and foreign factories are still silent as ever, probably because the yarn price is not rising, and there is absolutely no intention to try raw materials. Therefore, the situation is still firm. Tongzhou flower, which has excellent body and bones, is priced at 134.5 yuan, and the quality is inferior to 130 yuan. The market is still stable, but the exchange rate is becoming more and more relaxed, and the foreign cotton purchase price is falling day by day. Tongzhou flowers from northern Jiangsu arrived at 1,163 bales, Changyinsha arrived at 243 bales, and Beisha arrived at 630 bales. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Tonghua 130.00 131.50 132.00 134.50 800 bales of colleagues</p>
<p>Taicang Flower 126.0 Another 500 bales</p>
<p>Xia Sha Flower 130.0 Another 135 bales</p>
<p>Fire Machine Flower 121.0 Another 20 bales</p>
<p>Another message, the Shanghai foreign cotton transaction has been increasingly active in recent days, and the yarn factories have also purchased, and colleagues have also slightly ordered, but all are long fibers. According to the current situation, the Shanghai yarn factory's stock will be exhausted, and the US cotton transaction is expected to gradually unfold. However, the selling price of Indian cotton is still more expensive than US cotton, so the current Indian cotton transaction will continue to be light for a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market was quieter yesterday, but it was quite firm, spot transactions were very lively, overseas cotton merchants were also very enthusiastic about trade, and colleague transactions were also good. Speculators are still waiting and watching, intending to quietly observe the development of the recent congressional discussion on cotton industry loans. The results of yesterday's closing were unchanged for the near-term in New York, and 35 points for the far-term, India rose 4 rupees together, Egypt rose 10 points, and Liverpool fell back 8 pence.</p>
<h3>Food New Japonica Rice Rose Again, Guest Indica Rice Hoarders Sold</h3>
<p>Du rice hovered, and the market has not receded. After the prices of various goods in the previous market returned to soft once, they tightened again yesterday, because the source was slightly scarce. Goods such as paper Su Jia Feng Qing arrived in 178 cars, and the weather was rainy and people's hearts were good again. The early market watched, and at noon, the local merchants saw that there were not many goods in the market, and took the opportunity to sell cheaply, and the eating market was not harsh. For a time, the situation suddenly tightened, and new japonica rice and tea seed cellar species, Baige, etc. were traded quite heavily, with more than 3,000 bales, and the closing market price increased by 2 to 3 jiao compared to the previous one. Lu Yangjian's road was inferior due to the influence of guest Jian, and the market price was difficult to keep pace with the japonica rice market. Although the city goods are subtle, it is not uncommon to ask Jin, the market is cold, because of the lack of change, the change of new yuan sales is not widespread, the arrival of goods is also scarce, and the price is neither honorable nor disgraceful. The guest Jian market arrived at 4,500 bales of Beijing Wu Jian from the wheels yesterday. The prices of Jiangbei Jian are still inconsistent in the two places, and it is not easy to transport them. Through the local shop's stomach search, the guest family has the intention of holding on, and the situation is tight. Beijing Wu Jian followed closely, and there were inland gangs absorbing and deciding the goods, and the market color was also good. However, it was expected that the East Bank and hoarders would take the opportunity to launch, and the situation would become chaotic again. Fortunately, sales markets in all roads were very strong, and the closing still felt stable. The market price has been difficult to improve, and 6,000 bales have been traded.</p>
<p>In addition, guest Xian first inherited the crazy wind of the previous day, and Japanese merchants continued to sell in small batches. The morning market opening price was once suppressed, and then the local Jian arrived and was reduced, and the small hoarding Ken cheaply sold, and then vibrated in unison under the addition of inland rural production. The noon market price saw 2 to 3 jiao back, and the high guest Xian was 22 yuan, and the Shangtuo called high. However, after the market price rebounded, there were floating hoards and Jiangbei gangs selling, and the market in the afternoon was weak again. The upper and lower afternoon transactions were only more than 3,000 bales. However, it was heard that the number of direct batch entries was also 2 to 3,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Powder Sales Gradually Quiet, Wheat Prices Rise Step by Step</h3>
<p>Flour Yesterday's existing powder transaction was reduced compared to the previous one. Although the local guests had designated offices, they were only scattered embellishments. At present, the factory still restricts large gang transactions, and customers are not greedy, so the market is gradually entering the market. The No. 2 flour factory's inventory opened at 7 yuan 4 jiao, the artillery powder at 7 yuan 5 jiao, the return of Rao goods at 7 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen, and the outer stack of warship powder at 7 yuan 3 jiao, with 2 to 3,000 bales traded. The total number of bales traded by the local guests was also less than 30,000, and the market was calm.</p>
<p>Wheat The source is still scarce, and the inventory is gradually decreasing. Those who hold the goods are trying to make a profit, and the market is rising step by step. However, the factory is unwilling to enter more because the price is too high. Yesterday, the Fu Che two factories only handled 2 to 3,000 bales, while the hoarders continued to pull in 7 to 8 cars, priced at 11 yuan 5 jiao half to 4 jiao, another 1 to 2 jiao higher than before.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Shanghai Silk Is Still Expensive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market, Japan was flat and tired, the United States fell sharply, the exchange standard silk near-term fell by 1 jiao half and stopped printing, the far-term fell by 1 jiao 4 fen half, the spot Japanese silk fell by 9 fen to 1 jiao, Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each fell by 1 jiao. The local silk market has recently been heard to be under two layers of pressure (exchange rate is long, silk price falls), and sluggish external sales are inevitable. However, the Zha Mei Zhuang foreign firm entered Jili's upper body and sold it for 2,700 yuan, and the French Zhuang foreign firm's white factory made it for 3,950 yuan. Fairly speaking, it is a good sales board. Since the exchange rate has been lengthened for more than a month, it has reached more than one-third of the previous time. If it is compared with the US dollar 6.50 yuan and the 9-yuan standard, the Shanghai silk price has fallen by nearly 1,000 yuan on the exchange rate changes. However, recently the silk price is still on a high line, and Shanghai raw silk stock materials are lacking in both. Therefore, the silk price has no tendency to slump. However, the current silk market is at least no longer a good opportunity for domestic purchases and hoarding.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Soybean Oil Loosened</h3>
<p>Soybean oil Because the source is connected, although it is manipulated by large households, the chips have felt loose, resulting in a potential to loosen, and people's hearts are calm. Yesterday's market fell in the morning and returned in the afternoon. The statistics market opened 80 barrels of Dalian oil, priced from 65 yuan, and closed at 66 yuan. Kobe oil opened 90 barrels at 66 yuan, Qingdao barrel oil 50 barrels at 65 yuan, Yandi oil 200 pieces at 48 yuan 5 jiao, Qingdi oil 130 pieces at 48 yuan. 150 pieces of soybean oil will arrive from Yantai on the 4th, 410 bales of soybeans will arrive from Beisha, and 1,490 bales will be exported to Hong Kong on the 5th, 755 bales to Singapore, and 900 barrels of raw oil will be transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Domestic Sugar Is Quite Active</h3>
<p>Domestic sugar has been quite active in the past two days, and has been re-expanded. Chao Gang opened 14500 bales of Huanggang Qing, 38 yuan for Gaozhuang, 36 yuan for the second, and thousands of bales of Shangbai powder for 57 yuan. Guang Gang opened 360 pieces of Xiangzhuang Pianqing for 32 yuan. Shi Lu Gang opened 550 bales of Shang Diaoqing for 35 yuan (cash), 1 to 2 yuan higher than before. Foreign sugar is weaker with the re-length of foreign exchange and the smaller US dollar. The association divides the market. The spot 24 crude white fell by 1 yuan and a half, the native stack was 51 yuan, the foreign stack was initially 52 yuan, and then dropped to 51 yuan 8 jiao to 5 jiao, the transit goods were 41 yuan, the Taikoo Che Bai B mark called 57 yuan, no transaction, Dutch red was 1 yuan 3 jiao less for 41 yuan half, the native cotton white and the native ice were all seen to be following loose, and the market image was quite depressed.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Eastern Zhejiang Cloth Sales Turned Prosperous</h3>
<p>The cloth market has been quite stable due to the strong current sales in eastern Zhejiang. Light and heavy coarse cloth produced by Yihua and Xinyu two factories, due to the factory's lack of spot goods, the sales board turned better. The selling price of 13.14 pound coarse cloth produced by each factory has exceeded the price of ordinary 16 pound goods, and the transaction of light pound coarse cloth is also strong, and the price of each piece is 1 jiao to 1 jiao higher. The prices of fine cloth, fine twill, and dyed and printed fabrics are consistently stable.

<p>Proposed Content: Two Items</p>
<p>The proposal put forward by the Shanghai Municipal Council is six pages long and typed with double spacing between lines. The SMC proposal contains two items: (1) The police power over the roads built beyond the border should still be under the jurisdiction of the SMC; (2) The area where the roads are built beyond the border should be jointly managed by the SMC and the puppet municipal government, as a temporary measure to prevent the recurrence of conflicts and maintain law and order. It is solemnly stated that this is not a permanent agreement. Mr. Fu insisted on comprehensive takeover as a fundamental solution, but did not object to the conclusion of a temporary agreement. As a result of the talks, the puppet "Mayor" has agreed to give serious consideration to the SMC's proposal.</p>
<p>Situation in Western Shanghai: Temporary Stability</p>
<p>Currently, the two sides are discussing the issue of police power, while the issue of taxes remains unresolved. However, according to sources close to the SMC, the overall solution proposed by the SMC is that the authority over all roads built beyond the border should be under the jurisdiction of the SMC, and the taxes on the houses on both sides should be collected by the puppet "municipal government." The public utility expenses incurred by the SMC in the roads built beyond the border should be reimbursed by the puppet "municipal government." However, this statement has not been confirmed. According to foreign observers, the long-standing issue of road construction beyond the border may come to a temporary end soon. However, this temporary solution can only enable the SMC to coexist peacefully with the Japanese puppets during the extreme period. The Japanese puppets will inevitably continue to encroach upon and oppress, ultimately becoming a factor that further deteriorates Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>Rights and Interests of the Concession: Not Abandoned</p>
<p>Whether this proposal can take effect soon, Mr. Fessenden, Mr. Philip, and Mr. Fu Xiaoan all declined to express their opinions yesterday morning. Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, only said, "I am always full of hope." Mr. Fu Xiaoan said, "This matter requires a long period of consideration." Mr. Philip told reporters, "He is not prepared to make any statement." This is because the SMC hopes that the content of this negotiation will not be disclosed temporarily during the process. However, according to a senior official of the SMC, "The SMC cannot regard the rights and interests of the roads built beyond the border as completely abandoned, then you can know the general outline of the content of the six-page proposal."</p>
<p>Japanese Puppets Covet Water and Electricity in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>While the issue of police power over the roads built beyond the border in western Shanghai is currently being discussed by the public concession authorities and the puppet side, the "China Water and Electricity Company" of the Japanese puppet side is also thinking of taking the opportunity to covet the water and electricity supply rights for the roads built beyond the border. The Japanese-language "Mainland News" openly promoted this the night before last. When reporters visited Mr. Hawkins, Chairman of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and asked for his opinion, Mr. Hawkins replied, "I am not afraid of such ridiculous remarks at all," and pointed out that the electricity in the western district is currently supplied by the Shanghai Western Electric Power Company, which was specially approved by the governments of China and the United States.</p>
<p>Report in Western Newspapers: Details of the Meeting</p>
<p>According to the English "North China Daily News," Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, and Mr. Philip, Secretary-General and Director-General, went to Mr. Fu Xiaoan's residence in Jiangwan at 4:30 PM yesterday (the 2nd) with official documents from the council to visit Mr. Fu. The document was typed on both sides and consisted of six sheets, containing the SMC's suggestions for resolving the long-standing dispute over the issue of roads outside the border. The three gentlemen met and discussed the suggestions for nearly half an hour.</p>
<p>The discussion was limited to explaining the points contained in the Council's document. In addition to the original "suggestions", a copy was also handed over to Mr. Fu. The three gentlemen did not express any certainty this morning (the 3rd) as to whether the suggestions could be achieved soon. According to Mr. Fessenden's statement to reporters, "I am always hopeful." Mr. Fu Xiaoan said, "This matter requires a long period of consideration." Mr. Philip said that he had nothing to report, because the SMC hoped to avoid publicizing this matter temporarily. An official of the SMC recently spoke with reporters and said, "It cannot be expected that the SMC will give up all its rights in the roads outside the border." From this statement, it can be seen that the content of the SMC's suggestions is mostly related to the issue of police affairs in the disputed area.</p>
<p>An official of the SMC declared to newspaper reporters yesterday that the suggestions for resolving the dispute between the two sides were of a "temporary" nature, but the official did not mention the issue of collecting taxes from residents in the area outside the border. It is understood that the SMC had previously stated that it would not give up the right to collect taxes until other issues related to the area had been satisfactorily negotiated.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Again Commit Barbaric Acts</p>
<p>According to the English "North China Daily News," it has recently been heard that the Dadao police have continued to carry out barbaric actions on roads outside the border, and slapped two British women in a bus at the intersection of Anhua Temple Road and Columbia Road. This incident occurred at around 6:00 PM on Sunday, but it has only just been reported. The reason why the two British women did not report the incident was not because they were upset, but because they believed that reporting the matter to the police department, which had been repeatedly humiliated in the area, would also be futile. The reason for the incident was that the two women took a bus to the intersection of Anhua Temple Road and Columbia Road and saw several Dadao police officers entering the bus with dogs without muzzles. One of the women questioned the Dadao police, and as a result, one of the Dadao police officers deliberately slapped the woman. Another British woman protested and was also slapped.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Densely Deployed in the Suburbs, Japanese Troops Suddenly on Alert, Patrols Uninterrupted in the Shanghai Urban Area, Chinese Troops on Standby on the Outskirts of Western Shanghai, Inspection Increasingly Tight in the Northern District of the Suzhou River</h3>
<p>Japanese naval and army units in the Hongkou District suddenly took strict precautions yesterday. Each squadron of military police (more than ten people in each squadron) patrolled everywhere, and the situation was quite tense. In the occupied areas such as the Yinxiang District, the Xinzha District, and the Jiangwan District, the Japanese army dispatched mounted troops of more than thirty people each (all wearing yellow woolen uniforms and fully armed) to patrol back and forth. At the same time, the Japanese Army Headquarters on Jiangwan Road and the concession troops on Houhaine Road also sent out motorcycle teams equipped with light machine guns to patrol. According to a reporter from Daguan News Agency, the Japanese side took this measure entirely because the Chinese troops in the nearby suburbs were unusually active and they were deeply afraid of being infiltrated into the area and carrying out attacks. Therefore, the situation was particularly chaotic.</p>
<p>Strict Inspection in the Northern District of the Hebei Province</p>
<p>At the two barbed wire gaps at the intersection of Beijiangxi Road, Wenjianshi Road, and Haining Road in the Northern District of the Suzhou River, the Japanese sentries on duty were even stricter in their inspection of residents entering and exiting yesterday, especially young men and those carrying objects. At the same time, two Japanese sentries standing opposite the British soldiers at the intersection of Baoshan Road in Zhabei and the end of Beihenan Road were also extremely strict in their questioning of residents passing through the area, and often forced them to undress and wait for them to inspect. Those entering and exiting regarded it as a daunting task. This move is actually to prevent the Chinese from taking the opportunity to infiltrate.</p>
<p>Along Both Roads</p>
<p>Amid the tense atmosphere in the four suburbs, the Japanese puppet side has been busily engaged in implementing the so-called "winter defense" ahead of schedule. On the Shangnan and Shangchuan Roads in the Pudong area, passengers are now being searched very strictly to prevent dangerous elements from infiltrating the urban area. Although there are three puppet "armies" of Zhang Miaogen, Xu Hongfa, and Qin Xingyan as barriers between the Japanese army and the guerrillas, guerrillas often appear behind the puppet "armies," posing a serious threat to the Japanese strongholds. The Japanese navy and army, who could have slept peacefully at night, are now busy all night, guarding key points and unable to rest. The area inside and outside the city walls in the Nanshi area is relatively safe. In the arc-shaped outer periphery of the south railway station, Longhua, and the west along the railway connecting the north and south railway stations, not only late at night, but even during the day, guerrillas pass through. The Japanese army often pretends not to see them due to the small number of people. These guerrillas are densely deployed in the four suburbs and will wait for the regular army to arrive at the designated location and establish contact before making any progress.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Electric Lines Damaged for Days</h3>
<p>Chinese active troops have been unusually active along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways during this week. Although the Japanese military authorities have transferred Japanese puppet troops to towns and villages everywhere for heavy guard, the military money and telegraph lines along the Nanjing-Shanghai route have been repeatedly damaged. Although craftsmen have been sent to repair them section by section as soon as possible, other places have been damaged after the repairs have been completed. Yesterday, there were more than ten workers repairing the money from Zhenru to Nanxiang.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Pinghu Build a Motor Road</h3>
<p>People in Pinghu said that the Japanese troops stationed in Pinghu have decided to build a motor road between the south gate and the north gate of the county for the convenience of military transportation. Recently, the Ganhe area has been filled in, and residents in the area have been notified that all houses must be demolished and moved back several feet. Currently, the facades of houses in the Yangjiaqiao area have all been demolished.</p>
<h3>Permanently Resolving the Refugee Problem, Raising a Million Dollar Fund, Currently Working Hard to Evacuate Refugees, Approximately 10,000 People Still Awaiting Relief</h3>
<p>The "Continental News" stated that yesterday (the 2nd) the goal of the city's major relief workers was to prepare a fund of one million yuan to permanently solve the refugee problem in Shanghai. The staff engaged in this arduous task included Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Chinese directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Mr. Yu and Mr. Yuan serve as the chairman and secretary-general of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, respectively. According to Mr. Yuan, they are currently working hard to evacuate the refugees here, either sending them back home or helping them to find employment so that they can become self-reliant.</p>
<p>10,000 People Relying Entirely on Relief</p>
<p>However, there are at least 10,000 poor people in Shanghai who rely entirely on charitable relief. This number includes the elderly, weak, and orphans who were forced to come to Shanghai and have no homes to return to, and most of them are refugees who fled to Shanghai after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. The million-dollar plan is still in its initial stages. A portion of this money will be allocated from the surplus of the funds raised by the association each month to maintain the poor. In addition, other methods will be used to raise funds in the future to enrich the fund so that it can reach this goal in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Large Shelters Well-Managed</p>
<p>At the same time, the total number of refugees in the city's shelters still exceeds 37,000, and 13,000 of them live in the two shelters run by the association. The Dunxin Road Shelter, which can accommodate 10,000 refugees, was opened in the first half of this year. In addition to providing food and accommodation to the refugees in the shelter, the association also set up workshops in it to teach the refugees a skill and employ them as much as possible. However, after the shelter was opened, it was handed over to the Salvation Army for direct management. Now, the management rights and the industrial and educational parts of the shelter are all the responsibility of the Salvation Army staff.</p>
<p>Surplus Funds Sufficient for Application</p>
<p>It has also been proposed to hand over the Yanping Road Shelter, which is also run by the association, to the Salvation Army for management, but the Salvation Army has not yet considered it appropriate to take over. Those living in the shelter pay all or part of their living expenses themselves. Mr. Yuan added that although there are many poor people under his management, the association will be able to handle the relief problem financially during the coming winter months, unless unpredictable circumstances are encountered. The surplus funds accumulated in the spring and summer are sufficient for the expected needs. The high cost of living in Shanghai has made it difficult to handle relief matters. Since the summer, the cost of food per refugee has increased from two yuan to five yuan. Mr. Yuan praised his co-workers. It is said that since the establishment of the organization, at least twelve co-workers have volunteered their services for part or all of their time, but only those with a true spirit of sacrifice can serve so generously.</p>

<h3>French Municipal Council Agrees to Store Grain, Trying to Purchase and Store Within Possible Limits</h3>
<p>The Citizen's Federation of the First Special District proposed that the authorities of the two concessions take advantage of the new grain market, purchase from the production areas, set up warehouses, and store grain to meet the needs of the people. All parties expressed sympathy and hoped to see it implemented as soon as possible. It is now learned that the French Concession Municipal Council has officially replied to the Federation, saying, "Dear Sirs, We have received your letter of October 27, asking this Council to find a way to purchase new grain for storage, which we have noted. This proposal is very much agreed with and will be carried out within the possible limits."</p>

<h3>Language Exhibition Officially Opened Yesterday, Displaying More Than 2,000 Precious Exhibits, Visitors Came in an Endless Stream Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>The Language Exhibition, which has been preparing for three months, officially opened at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Daxin Company's fourth-floor venue. Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Lu Gaoyi, Mr. Chen Wangdao, and others attended and held the opening ceremony. Although there was drizzle yesterday, visitors came in an endless stream and were very satisfied. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Speech</p>
<p>At the opening ceremony, Mr. Lin Kanghou first gave an opening speech, saying that it was not easy to hold a language exhibition at this time and in this place. This exhibition is like systematically connecting many precious beads to form a very precious necklace, so its significance is very important. It is hoped that this exhibition will arouse the enthusiastic interest of the public and in-depth research. Mr. Chen Wangdao then gave a speech, saying that the scope of this exhibition is very broad, purely standing in an objective position and providing research materials. It is hoped that it will attract the attention and research of all sectors of society, and that the guests will see different things from different perspectives and offer more criticism. Then, Mr. Lin cut the ribbon, and the guests followed him into the exhibition hall to visit.</p>
<p>Exhibition Performance</p>
<p>The exhibits are arranged in an orderly manner according to historical nature. All the exhibits total more than 2,000 pieces. In addition to those received before, there were many precious exhibits sent by various circles yesterday, including Yin Dynasty oracle bones, bronze bottles from the Warring States period, Shang Dynasty tripods, Zhou Fu Gui Jue, a Bible ancient book photo from 1121 to 1575, and Ji Juemi's large pen of more than five feet long and one foot in circumference, pagoda pens, fishing pens, etc., and other rare and precious items, which aroused great interest among the audience. There were also performances such as blind children learning to read and mute children reading in the venue, which surprised the audience. Yesterday, more than 1,000 people from all walks of life visited. The association will hold performances of forty or fifty dialects every Saturday and Sunday from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, and new text performances in the afternoon. In order to promote language education, several experts have been assigned to give lectures in rotation. Once the location is negotiated, the lecture schedule will be announced.</p>
<p>Precious Manuscripts</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Xulun, a former professor at Peking University, is famous for his expertise in writing. The elders Chen Yan and Wu Shijian praised him as the direct successor to the Wang family of Gaoyou. Scholars in Jiangsu and Zhejiang cannot compete with him. He has written about Lao Tzu, Zhuangzi, Deng Xi, Liezi, Lv's Spring and Autumn, and Stone Drum Text, which have been published in the world. However, the essence of his energy is in the "Shuowen Jiezi Liushu Shuzheng" (Explanation of Words and Analysis of Six Scripts) book. After 30 years of diligence, he has recently completed 30 giant volumes. His analysis of the six scripts is very precise, and he has unique insights on the three books of pictograms, transformations, and borrowing. He said that the texts and references in the "Shuowen" were added by later generations, and that the ancient script was the seal script of the lacquer script, which was also not mentioned by previous people. He corrected errors and omissions to four or five hundred things. Wu Shijian praised it as a work that has not been seen in the three hundred years of the Qing Dynasty, which is certainly not a false reputation. It is now heard that the Language Exhibition has obtained the first and last two volumes of the copy for display, so that scholars who study Chinese characters can see it first.</p>
<h3>Autumn Grand Horse Race Starts Today, Grand Champion to be Drawn on the 8th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club's autumn competition starts today and will be held for six days, on today, the day after tomorrow, the 7th, 8th, and 11th, starting at 1:15 PM. The sixth day, the 13th, will start at 11:30 AM. The program is wonderful and the best this year. The Grand Champion race to be held on the 8th on the sixth race is attracting much attention. Since the Grand Champion tickets were sold, they have been selling very well due to the simple procedures and excellent methods. Each full sheet has eleven entries and costs ten yuan in national currency. Retail is one yuan per entry. The results are better than this spring. The association has specially set up a temporary ticket office under the arch of the association at No. 304A Maugham Road (that is, the gate opposite Mandarin Road) on the race days before the draw for the convenience of all sectors of society to purchase. It only sells Grand Champion tickets. It does not require a ticket and is convenient for everyone to choose and purchase. It is a good last chance to win a prize. It is heard that the lottery department of the association at No. 304 Maugham Road will still sell as usual.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Opens Chongqing-Yangon Route</h3>

<h3>Foreign Merchants' Machine-Made Goods, Certification by the Shanghai Consulate</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, for the matter of stamping and certifying the form of foreign merchants' application for machine-made foreign goods' duty payment procedures, should be handled by the Shanghai Consulate. After drafting an opinion, it was sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs by telegram. Now it is received that the Ministry of Economic Affairs' telegram on October 30 states, "There is nothing wrong with the consular office handling the certification of the forms submitted by foreign merchants for machine-made goods' duty payment. Please be informed." It is now learned that the blue and white passes issued by the Japanese before July 10 of this year should be exchanged for new passes before the end of December. Those who have the original pass should pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Sichuan-Kangding Civilian Bank's Business Spreads Throughout the Southwest</h3>
<p>Sichuan-Kangding Civilian Commercial Bank was formed by the merger of the former Sichuan-Kangding Development Bank, Chongqing Civilian Bank, and Sichuan Commercial Bank. The three banks were all engaged in ordinary commercial banking business and had a history of eight or nine years. The motivation for the merger was purely to gather manpower and financial resources to help the government build the economy of the southwest and support domestic industry and commerce. The bank's head office is located in Chongqing, with a paid-up capital of 4 million yuan in national currency. Branch offices are located throughout the southwest provinces. The Shanghai branch moved to the French Concession due to the war in Shanghai. At present, the central district business is gradually recovering. The bank moved from the French Concession to No. 284 Jiujiang Road on November 1 to handle business. It is heard that the bank has many preferential and convenient terms for various deposits, and the discount for remittances to the interior is very modest.</p>
<h3>Local Briefs</h3>
<p>Recently, foreign exchange has slightly loosened, so silk prices have risen sharply, and buyers have withdrawn, and the market is quite unstable. Since June 1 of this year, 23,414 bales of silk goods have been exported, compared with 11,546 bales in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The Western Paint Association was held up due to the shipment of paint to Sichuan passing through the coastal defense. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate for its release. It is now learned that the goods of the Defeng Paint Company have been telegraphed to the Consulate in Hanoi to negotiate for their release nearby.</p>
<p>The postal remittances to various cities and counties in northern Jiangsu, such as Taixing, Yangshuyuan, Yancheng, Longgangzhen, and Zhenwumiao, have been temporarily suspended, but the port is still receiving and sending as usual, with an additional 6 cents per yuan for the subsidy fee.</p>
<p>The International Relief Committee believes that its West Ames Road shelter still has more than 5,000 refugees, who are short of clothing and bedding, and is specially soliciting winter clothing donations from all walks of life. Send it to the Society on the third floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge.</p>

The price is 60 cents. Please purchase it in person at the Society at No. 34 Xinzha Road.</p>
<h3>Various Local Charity Organizations Hold a Farewell Banquet for Dr. Baker; Baker's Management of Charitable Enterprises Benefited the Masses; He Is Scheduled to Return to the United States on the 21st during His Regular Leave</h3>
<p>Dr. Baker, the General Secretary of the China International Famine Relief Commission and the Shanghai International Red Cross Society, has been in China for over twenty years, serving as an advisor to the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Trust Bureau of the Chinese government for more than ten years in total. Dr. Baker is also enthusiastic about charitable work and has made remarkable achievements. When the five northern provinces of China suffered a severe drought in the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920),</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries</p>
<p>Initiated fundraising efforts. The American Red Cross generously donated a large sum of money and publicly appointed Dr. Baker to manage the relief efforts. He then organized work relief projects to build 850 miles of highways. He also managed the Weibei work relief project to build the Jinghui Canal. Local residents near a large bridge named it after Baker in commemoration, reflecting his virtues and the depth of respect people had for him. In the twentieth year of the Republic of China (1931), the Yangtze River flooded,</p>
<p>Causing Widespread Disaster.</p>
<p>The National Government's Flood Relief Committee appointed him as the Director of Transportation, responsible for distributing a total of 450,000 tons of flour and wheat. He worked diligently and tirelessly. Later, he raised relief funds for the China International Famine Relief Commission, inspected disaster areas, and managed emergency relief and work relief projects with unwavering enthusiasm, sparing no effort. After the August 13th Shanghai Incident, he organized refugee relief and shelter, making even greater contributions. Now, as his</p>
<p>Regular Leave to Return Home</p>
<p>Is scheduled, he will depart for the United States on the President Coolidge on the 21st of this month. Various local charity organizations and Chinese and foreign friends plan to hold a public farewell banquet at Xinghualou Restaurant, 343 Fuzhou Road, at 7:30 PM on Wednesday, the 8th. Those who have a close friendship with him and wish to join are welcome to contact the China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road (telephone 91768).</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange and Legal Tender; Those Who Purchase Foreign Exchange in Shanghai Cannot Earn Interest; The Decline in the Value of Legal Tender Has Reached Its Limit</h3>
<p>— Observations by G.E. Hubbard —</p>
<p>British economic expert G.E. Hubbard's analysis of Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange is worthy of reference.</p>
<p>Overview of Import and Export Trade</p>
<p>(1) For import trade, luxury goods and materials needed for the European war have naturally ceased to enter the Chinese market. However, cotton imports have resumed from the United States after several months of suspension, with an average value of two to three million US dollars per month. As for rice and wheat, their market prices here are too low, making imports unviable. (2) In export trade, China's situation of being occupied by foreign powers remains unchanged, making it impossible to independently control its export trade. Currently, Japan ranks first in terms of export volume. At the same time, the Straits Settlements, South Africa, Australia, France, etc., are harming China's foreign exchange reserves by restricting the import of Chinese industrial products.</p>
<p>Control and Speculation of Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>(3) Regarding foreign exchange control, although the exchange rate of legal tender is now much lower than when the equalization fund existed, those in charge seem to be planning to use the large amounts of legal tender obtained from selling foreign exchange to repurchase foreign exchange. In the past three months, they have already repurchased two to three million pounds. Generally, they come out to absorb the supply from sellers whenever the market situation tends to ease. (4) Speculation in Shanghai foreign exchange is not very significant at present. Forward trading of British and American currency mostly involves hedging relationships for those dealing in gold bars. However, there is so-called speculative activity by the "Hong Kong gang," which were large buyers in July and August, and subsequently became large sellers, followed by Singapore. It is still difficult to determine whether these actions are purely speculative or represent capital flight from the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strong Shanghai Exchange Market</p>
<p>(5) Regarding investment, in the past three years, a large amount of legal tender here has been used to purchase foreign exchange, largely by Chinese individuals. Once converted into foreign exchange, these funds cannot earn interest. However, many Chinese capitalists now believe that the decline in the external value of legal tender has reached its limit. Moreover, the current exchange rate is highly favorable to them, so why not abandon foreign exchange and recover legal tender? There have indeed been large foreign exchange transactions of this nature recently, making the exchange market here even stronger.</p>
<p>A Glimpse into the Future of the Exchange Market</p>
<p>(6) There are currently various currencies circulating domestically in North China, which are in a hostile relationship with legal tender. The crisis should not be ignored. For example, the currency issued by the United Reserve Bank is circulating in the northern market, and its value has been lower than legal tender for a long time, once falling as low as 30%. However, the situation is now reversed. In this case, those holding North China currency cannot freely obtain foreign exchange, but can readily go to Shanghai to purchase foreign currency. In short, it is highly likely that North China will seize foreign exchange from the Shanghai market. The above are the main factors related to the prosperity and decline of the exchange market. However, the ultimate fate of the exchange market will largely depend on the duration of the war. If stability can be achieved within three months without hindering China's future development, the exchange rate of legal tender will inevitably rise. I fear that the current easing trend in the exchange market will not last long.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Wang Yaotang of the Public Concession Resigns</h3>
<p>Wang Yaotang, a lawyer in the Legal Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, was hired by the Municipal Council as a lawyer in the Legal Department on April 10, 1930, after returning from studying in the United States. He has been in this position for ten years, representing the Municipal Council in tens of thousands of criminal cases brought before the Special District Court. As Mr. Wang no longer wishes to continue working for the Municipal Council, he has formally submitted his resignation to the Municipal Council a few days ago, in accordance with the provisions of his employment contract, which requires three months' notice for resignation. Mr. Wang will leave the Legal Department at the end of January next year. It is said that after leaving the Municipal Council, Mr. Wang will practice law on his own. As Mr. Wang is skilled in advocacy and has a wide circle of friends, his legal practice will surely flourish at that time.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Natives in Shanghai Urge the Fellow-Provincials Association to Eliminate Malpractices in Ticket Sales for Ningbo Ships; Ticket Agencies Resemble a Black Market; If This Continues, It Will Be Extremely Difficult for Ningbo Natives to Return Home</h3>
<p>Yang Baogeng and other Ningbo natives in Shanghai sent a letter yesterday to the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, stating: We are writing to you because fellow-provincials returning home recently have experienced unimaginable difficulties. All shipping companies sell tickets before the ships arrive in Shanghai, and the time for sale is very short, with tickets often selling out in a single day. This is because shipping companies issue guarantees in advance to customs brokers, etc., so the actual number of tickets sold to the public is very limited. It is difficult for fellow-provincials to purchase tickets directly from the companies. There are also ticket agencies that wholesale tickets and resell them to fellow-provincial travelers, raising the price by one or several times, engaging in extreme exploitation. The root cause of this situation is that shipping companies issue tickets based on references, creating this complex situation. Furthermore, I personally stood in a certain ticket agency for several hours yesterday and witnessed the ticket agency initially charging nine yuan for each Haifu shipping ticket, then reducing it to eight yuan. However, after noon, as the departure time approached, some people even went to the ticket agency to sell Haifu shipping tickets, asking for a price lower than the face value of four yuan and five jiao. Based on the above situation, tickets to Ningbo have become a black market, with prices fluctuating according to demand. If this continues, fellow-provincials will have no opportunity to return home unless they pay a ticket price several times higher than the face value. We are saddened by the above situation, and therefore specially write to your association, requesting that you instruct the shipping companies to improve the ticket purchase process, and not issue entire batches of tickets to customs brokers or ticket agencies. Tickets should be sold to the public as openly as possible, based on photo identification, to alleviate the suffering of fellow-provincials and eliminate malpractices.</p>

<h3>Astrologer Claims Person Will Die; False Statements Used to Deceive and Swindle Large Sum of Money; Madam Shi Kongyu Defrauded of Up to 100,000; Mask Removed, Yang Qiaomin Detained</h3>
<p>Shi Kongyu, a native of Ningbo, engaged in exchange trading and had some savings. In the past, a friend of his had his fortune told by an astrologer, who said that he would certainly die. Not long after, that friend died unexpectedly. As a result, Shi deeply believed in astrology. In the first month of the year before last, Shi sought divination from the astrologer Ding Taiyan on Xin Zha Road. Ding predicted that Shi would undoubtedly die in the ninth month of that year. Shi was deeply frightened. Yang Qiaomin (also known as Dixiang Letian), a native of Wuxi, was also</p>
<p>Proficient in Astrology,</p>
<p>But did not operate a business with a signboard. Through a friend's introduction, Shi entrusted Yang to write a fortune report, but did not inform him of Ding's statement beforehand. When Yang issued the fortune report, he also claimed that Shi would die in the ninth month. Shi was even more frightened and sought a way to save himself from Yang. After considering the matter, Yang said that there was a way to save him, but it required the method of "receiving life force" to save him. This method involved setting up an altar to pray to the gods for a considerable period. During this period, the gods would definitely indicate that</p>
<p>Cash Offerings</p>
<p>Were required, the amount of which would also be indicated by the gods and must not be delayed. Yang instructed Shi to prepare an envelope with a blank sheet of paper inside and offer it before the gods if he had any doubts during the prayer process. Soon, an enlightenment would come and the envelope would be filled with written answers on the blank paper. As a result, Shi became even more convinced. After a long period, Shi never dared to disobey any amount that the gods indicated for offerings, and complied with each and every one. To date, the amount</p>
<p>Has Reached Tens of Thousands of Gold.</p>
<p>At the time, Yang had said that this money would be returned to him after the completion of the prayer to the gods, but later Yang suddenly claimed that due to the unstable situation, this money could not be in his possession for the time being, as he feared incurring the wrath of the gods. It would be better to temporarily store it in a bank safe deposit box. Shi agreed. Therefore, the cash offered to the gods over time (wrapped in paper by Yang) was stored in a safe deposit box at Jin Cheng Bank. Later, Yang and Shi's wife became close friends as a result. Yang then planned to establish the Weiliduo MSG Factory, and</p>
<p>Shi Also Invested</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of gold (the factory's office was located on the fourth floor of 131 Hankou Road). Recently, Yang Qiaomin also had Shi's wife's fortune told, and said that her year was unlucky, and all jewelry, etc., could not be worn, and instructed her to hide them carefully. Unexpectedly, recently, Shi's wife needed to wear jewelry for a family celebration, so she opened the sealed paper package, only to find that all the jewelry inside had</p>
<p>Disappeared Without a Trace,</p>
<p>And all that was left was scrap paper. At this point, she realized that all of Yang's previous actions were a scam. The cash stored in the Jin Cheng Bank safe deposit box was definitely waste paper as well. The so-called establishment of the Weiliduo MSG Factory must have also been a scam to obtain his funds. Therefore, he reported the matter to the General Inspectorate. After investigation by Chinese detectives Jiang Shangpei and Yang Peisheng, it was confirmed to be true. Yang was</p>
<p>Arrested on Daxi Road</p>
<p>The day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Special District Court, where Magistrate Dai Rongduo opened the court for interrogation. Lawyer Qian Xunjiu of the Inspectorate stated that the case was complex and the investigation would be time-consuming, and the amount defrauded from the plaintiff was currently difficult to calculate accurately, but was approximately eighty to one hundred thousand yuan. Therefore, he requested that the defendant be temporarily detained pending investigation before formally filing charges. When questioned, Yang Qiaomin confessed that the amount defrauded was only about twenty thousand gold. The presiding judge verified the confession and ordered Yang Qiaomin to be detained pending further hearing.</p>
<h3>Fake "Anti-Smoking Bureau" Establishes "Anti-Smuggling Team"</h3>
<p>Da Guang News Agency reports that, in order to step up its poisoning policy and collect donations, the Japanese puppet regime recently appointed Zhu Yao, a henchman of the puppet "Reformed Government," to establish the so-called "Administrative Yuan Anti-Smoking Bureau" in Shanghai, occupying the former site of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society at 1286 North Sichuan Road in Hongkou. A brand-new bronze signboard was hung in front of the fake "Bureau." All opium shipped from Dalian, Qingdao, Hankou, and Northeast China to Shanghai is carried and packaged by Japanese ships. In order to facilitate escort and collection of donations and taxes, the so-called "Administrative Yuan Anti-Smoking Bureau Anti-Smuggling Headquarters" was also established in the private residence of a Zhu surnamed resident in Feihong Lane at the end of Gongping Road in Hongkou. It was officially established yesterday, disturbing the people and bringing more harm to society.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have read a news article published in the Local News section of your newspaper on the 17th of this month regarding a bizarre murder case in Hongqiao Town, Xuhui, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. The incident occurred on the night of September 14th and involved bandits who shot the victim, which was over a month ago. The details are as follows: The deceased was named Wang Jianying, 31 years old, residing at No. 38 Xinqiao, west end of Hongqiao Town (next to our family ancestral hall). Her father, Wang A'huo, previously ran a carriage business in Zhabei and had some savings. He only had one daughter, Jianying, who received a secondary education. She married a Chai surnamed man, and had a son named Lulu, who is now 11 years old. Later, due to disagreements between the couple, they divorced by mutual consent. A'huo and his wife also passed away one after another. Jianying then worked as a teacher in a certain elementary school, but resigned after a short period. Subsequently, through a friend's introduction, she joined the leather goods department of the Shanghai Huisheng Company as a female employee. After the Shanghai War, Jianying took her son back to the countryside to live with her. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 14th of last month, a burglar broke in. At that time, Jianying and her son had not yet gone to bed and were reading English under the light. The burglar threatened them with a gun, forbidding them from making any noise. After robbing them, he tried to molest Jianying, forcibly raping her, tearing her clothes in the process. Jianying refused to comply at the cost of her life and was shot and killed. These are the facts, and there is no falsehood. Fearing that the rumors are inaccurate and misleading, I am sending this letter to request a correction. Sincerely, Wang Linxi, October 27th.</p>
<h3>Manager of Dachun Bookstore and Others Accused of Breach of Trust and Embezzlement; Dispute Arises from the Sale of Surabaya Branch</h3>
<p>Dachun Bookstore was founded in 1925 as a partnership with a total capital of 60,000 yuan. The shareholders elected Wu Xirong as the general manager. The bookstore was originally located in Liucun, Jiucang Street, inside Ximen, South Shanghai, and a branch called Xiaojing Shanfang was established in North Shanghai, managed by Wang Danru. A Dachun branch was also established in Surabaya, Dutch East Indies, managed by Wu Xirong's daughter, Shen Zhongkun.</p>
<p>Business Was Flourishing</p>
<p>Before the war. After the August 13th Incident, the Nanshi area fell, and Dachun Bookstore moved to 25 Hehe Lane, Xiafei Road to conduct business. Now, Liu Xiangchu, a shareholder and assistant manager of Dachun Bookstore, along with shareholders Zheng Yimei and shareholder representatives Xiang Kemin (representing shareholder Xiong Xiji) and Yang Dongquan (representing shareholder Yang Ziji), have jointly hired lawyers Zheng Lin and Zhou Rong to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special District Court, accusing Wu Xirong, the manager of Dachun Bookstore, and Shen Zhongkun, the manager of the Surabaya branch, along with employee Yao Jianqiu, of</p>
<p>Breach of Trust and Embezzlement,</p>
<p>Requesting that they be investigated according to the law, and also seeking to revoke the illegal branch contract through civil litigation. It is alleged that in March of this year, Wang Danru passed away, and Xiaojing Shanfang, which he managed, had debts of 60,000 yuan. The creditors were pressing for payment, but General Manager Wu Xirong ignored them. The shareholders' meeting had no choice but to resolve to elect the plaintiffs to be responsible for the liquidation and planned to sell the Surabaya branch to repay the debts. However, Wu Xirong, Shen Zhongkun, and Yao Jianqiu colluded together and privately</p>
<p>Privately Transferred</p>
<p>And signed a transfer agreement for the Surabaya branch, deducting Shen Zhongkun's bonus of 20,000 yuan from the sale price of 50,000 yuan, and agreeing on a sale price of 30,000 gold. They paid the initial payment of 12,000 yuan into a private deposit, and the remaining 18,000 yuan was to be paid in installments until March 1941, which was too late to repay the debts. Furthermore, the shareholders' meeting on June 20th ordered Wu Xirong to hand over the books and seals and cease his duties as manager, with everything to be handled by the shareholders' meeting. However, Wu Xirong privately stamped the</p>
<p>Sale Agreement</p>
<p>With the round seal that had already been invalidated, which was clearly illegal. They requested that he be investigated according to the law. The court accepted the lawsuit and Magistrate Sun Pengxian opened the court for trial at 3:00 PM yesterday. Only Liu Xiangchu and his lawyer appeared on behalf of the plaintiffs, stating the illegal and criminal reasons of the defendants and submitting various pieces of evidence. Defendant Shen Zhongkun was in the Nanyang region, and Yao Jianqiu went to Jiangyin and did not appear. Only Wu Xirong and his defense lawyer appeared. After the court questioned Wu Xirong on each item, he was instructed to reschedule the hearing.</p>
<h3>Passerby Helps Arrest Thief; Awarded 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>At 10:20 AM on October 17th of this year, a Chinese man was robbed on Ningbo Road by two bandits (one of whom was armed with a handgun). A paper package containing 1,057 yuan was stolen. The victim shouted for help on the spot. A Chinese man with a "Three-Road-Head" hairstyle heard the alarm and gave chase. At this time, a passerby assisted in the chase, fearlessly catching the thief who was trying to escape with the stolen goods and handing him over to the police station. The victim accused him of armed robbery. The court sentenced him to five years in prison. The police department was very impressed by the Chinese man's act of bravery and righteousness and awarded him a bonus of 50 yuan as encouragement.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory predicted at 4:30 PM yesterday that the weather in Shandong and the surrounding areas and here is unstable, colder, and with sleet and rain, but with clear spells. There is a strong northeast to northwest wind. There is a northeast wind south of the Mazu Islands, and a cyclone west of Kyushu, due to a small low-pressure system moving northeast-east. In the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this area was highest at 66.7 degrees and lowest at 59.7 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 70.3 and the lowest was 59.2.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Tung Oil Shop; Watchman Shot; Shot in Left Flank, Seriously Wounded</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 PM last night, three bandits suddenly broke into the Shen Yuanlai Tung Oil Shop at No. 243 Yongning Lane, Guangdong Road. The three thieves threatened them with guns and searched the shop for about an hour before carrying the stolen goods out of the door and trying to escape. A shop assistant shouted to catch the thieves. Zhou A'si (45 years old, from Jiangbei), a watchman at No. 552 Yongning Lane, heard the alarm and bravely stepped forward. The thieves, seeing the watchman coming, immediately shot at him, hitting him in the left flank. The bullet did not pass through. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The three bandits fled into the darkness. Later, Chinese police summoned an ambulance and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. His injuries were serious and his life was in danger. It is reported that the shop suffered losses of about 20,000 yuan. Reporters went to the shop to investigate, but the shop staff refused to disclose the amount stolen.</p>

<h3>Speculation</h3>
<p>— Danran</p>
<p>How many modern inventions come from speculation? Thus, those who like to speculate can argue eloquently that speculation is an indispensable part of life today. On a small scale, no matter how I act or treat others, I must first speculate on how others will treat me; on a large scale, no matter how hard I should work or prepare, I only speculate on the future of the Sino-Japanese War and the outcome of the European war. As a result, some are suspicious and fearful, while others are opportunistic and seek advantages. Speculation, speculation, everywhere the sound of speculation.</p>
<p>Blind speculation is like fortune-telling or face reading, and wise people will certainly not believe it. Only speculation based on analysis of the matter, or deduction from cause to effect, or from effect to cause, will be accepted by the general public. Clever speculators are even better at comparing the situations on both sides, and then setting up several assumptions, believing that if it is not this way, then it is that way, and if it is not that way, then it is this way, speaking in a round and satisfying manner, all-encompassing, and without drawing a definite conclusion, thus winning the praise of others. (For example: If it does not rain tomorrow, it will definitely be sunny; otherwise, if tomorrow is sunny, it will definitely not rain.)</p>
<p>What kind of speculation is reasonable and can be established, I think I will still not care, and leave it to others to speculate. As I see it, I think we do not need speculation, at least not now. Because I believe that to make reasonable speculation, there are prerequisite conditions, that is, one must possess sufficient knowledge, keen observation, and clear analysis, and then be able to obtain results that are inevitable and reasonable. How many of our current speculators have reached this level? If they have not reached this level and engage in speculation, is it not just dreaming!</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that it is very difficult to achieve this perfect level of speculation, so why should we spend so much effort to prepare for it, and instead put aside the things that we should do, the things that we can do, and the things whose achievements may be even greater! As for now, I even think that even if someone has this ability to speculate, I hope that they will not take speculation as their business: if they cannot do something more practical, then, even if they only know how to wag their three-inch tongue, or only know how to discuss strategy on paper, they can say a few words or write a few lines of more practical words, words that can supplement the facts.</p>
<p>Finally, I will assert one more sentence: speculation is just speculation, and is not reliable. Speculation that hits the mark is only a very small number of exceptions. In our eyes, we have already seen how many boring speculations have become shattered soap bubbles. Why are we still so happy to speculate?</p>
<h3>A Gray Crowd</h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<p>This bustling road is simply like a filthy river. Living inside are a group of dirty and lively insects, drifting with the turbid flow, drifting east and west. The river is too narrow, there are too many vehicles, and people are crowded together, swimming and swimming all day long, never quiet. A clogged street, a clogged river!</p>
<p>This group of small and interesting insects hides their ugliness, hiding in the vehicles, sneaking around.</p>
<p>The dynamics of life.</p>
<p>A large truck slowly passes by, the back of the truck packed with a load of timber, lying this way and that.</p>
<p>The insects swim more lively, suddenly reaching out two skinny black hands like eagle claws, widening two gray eyes; first looking at the coolies sitting on the timber and chatting, and then using the strength of a suckling baby, grunting and groaning, grabbing a smaller piece of timber and dragging it back.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" The coolies casually shoulder the prepared walking stick (also some small pieces of timber) and wave it in the air.</p>
<p>A group of insects with hot hopes but no success suddenly scatter like they have grown wings, fleeing in a swarm.</p>
<p>However, one insect has grabbed a piece, hugging it tightly, hobbling away very quickly.</p>
<p>The black and thin face, like a ghost, grins, revealing a mouth of dirty, yellowed, uneven teeth, and laughs:</p>
<p>"Hehe! It's really not easy!"</p>
<p>Another insect, wearing an expressionless black face, leans against the telegraph pole, jealous of its companion's "profit."</p>
<p>A group of insects goes to find their other ways of life.</p>
<p>The good thing is that this road is like a fertile field with everything, being "developed" by the insects, becoming more and more fertile.</p>
<p>Isn't this a coal dust truck? Three or five black people squat on top of baskets of coal dust, playing around. That's a good opportunity for the insects, watching them laboriously lower their bodies, two terrifying skull-like holes, as usual, watching the top, using two trembling hands, hesitantly and quickly, grabbing the coal dust, grabbing it into a prepared bag.</p>
<p>Victory.</p>
<p>Afterwards, they hum with a dry voice, walking through the streets and alleys, looking for a stingy customer, exchanging it for a dozen or so copper coins, (of course! Sometimes it's more than that.) Holding them dearly. And continuing to do their life.</p>
<p>It's getting dark, the insects are gradually decreasing, and the turbid stream is gradually lonely and lifeless.</p>
<p>In the dark corners, a group of insects one by one stretch their tired waists, using broken wadding as mats, covering themselves with newspapers like "red and green quilts," bowing their heads and falling into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>The autumn wind rolls the fallen leaves, rustling, turning a group of insects into silkworms, curled up; or hugging each other, dreaming their dreams of being adventurers in the daytime.</p>
<p>The stiff insects of tomorrow morning will wake up again; or they will grow wings and fly more actively on the turbid stream.</p>
<h3>Boating</h3>
<p>— Shi Di</p>
<p>I love watching the water, the water is so deep, with clear, gentle waves, shimmering and bright. It is elegant and serene, yet lively like the soft melody of a harpsichord, like the chill of dawn brushing past the corners of a palace, the clear and melodious chime of wind chimes. I love the sight of fish leisurely swimming back and forth, darting through the algae and weeds: winding and turning at the bottom of the water, flashing a sliver of silver in the deep, rich colors.</p>
<p>I grew up in a water town, and I have never felt weary of the water. We cherish the water, just as we cherish our beloved hometown. I always like to sit alone on a large blue stone by the small river, gazing at the deep blue, clear water, the lush green moss on the stone pier, and the mussels and shells on the shallow beach.</p>
<p>A series of oar sounds ripple through the water, especially on bright moonlit nights when the dew is cool, or on misty mornings; the boatman gently rows the small boat, which leisurely swings back and forth in the clear waves. Or the plump ducks flap their wings with "ga ga" sounds, and the pure white geese float on the river like gentlemen. Such poetic charm always flows leisurely through my heart.</p>
<p>I am captivated, with both envy and reverie. I can never wash away the floating charm of boating.</p>
<p>Shedding the nightmare-like worries and fatigue, and forgetting the monotony and weariness of life, we are enveloped by the ripples on the water, and we drift on the green waves of South Lake. We awkwardly row through the gently melting waves, the cool breeze carrying a light mist that sprinkles coolness on our flushed faces, painting patches of water stains on our chests. We easily row the small boat, surrounded by the drooping weeping willows, pavilions and towers in the misty waves: the red walls of the Misty Rain Tower are hidden in the broken red leaves, topped by the blue sky, and white clouds float on the water's surface. The oars are like wings, as if soaring in the free sky.</p>
<p>Rude laughter shatters the pure beauty of the air. We row roughly, splashing the water waves, and accidentally bump into rows of water chestnuts, pulling up the oars, which are now bound with strings of fresh, verdant South Lake water chestnuts.</p>
<p>As the water droplets mingle with the sweat, we drift into the willow shade. Water smartweed and wildflowers entwine around the boat, and small fish dart past the weary oars...</p>
<p>When will I be able to pick up the unfamiliar oars again? I can't help but miss my faraway friends. The fleeting travels of the past three years, where can I find news of them now? My memory seems to be a beautiful dream, and the leisurely mood of amusement has long disappeared; yet I cherish my hometown even more passionately.</p>
<p>My hometown is blooming with even more vibrant and beautiful flowers, right now!</p>

<h3>"Tomorrow," I Want to Praise You</h3>
<p>— Lai Hong</p>
<p>"Tomorrow," I want to praise you!</p>
<p>But I won't just blindly praise you;——</p>
<p>Like the torch of the sun in June</p>
<p>Even if it burns our world red,</p>
<p>It may not make everyone's heart</p>
<p>Feel that this is progress after spring,</p>
<p>Or even just a little warmth.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow," I won't blindly praise you.</p>
<p>The Nazi and brutal</p>
<p>Stuff poured out of the coffin;</p>
<p>I also will not praise,</p>
<p>Young people who have been eroded by a lazy life</p>
<p>Always muttering "Tomorrow, tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Afraid that "tomorrow" will be too late to bury them.——</p>
<p>These things, I will not praise you "tomorrow";</p>
<p>I'm not Deng Fuzhe, a commander with a big nose,</p>
<p>Who sees everything as an indistinguishable mass,</p>
<p>Not to mention the prisoners in concentration camps</p>
<p>How cold sweat sometimes breaks out on their handcuffs!</p>
<p>However you, "Tomorrow,"</p>
<p>I still want to praise you!</p>
<p>But choosing Karl and Ilyich</p>
<p>And the brilliant "tomorrow" of friendly Russia.</p>
<p>I will give up so many pages of manuscript!</p>
<p>Putting aside what bothers me for the time being,</p>
<p>To praise our "tomorrow" of resisting Japan and building our country,</p>
<p>Calling on weak nations to bravely replace their guns and cannons</p>
<p>That burst-like but empty cheer and applause!</p>
<p>Today, oh "Tomorrow"!</p>
<p>Don't laugh at me for not having the ability yet;</p>
<p>I am tempering myself</p>
<p>Like a drummer in an orchestra tightening the skin of his snare drum.</p>
<p>I must try my best to raise your value to be praised,</p>
<p>Like the brothers on the front line;</p>
<p>Never just muttering "Tomorrow, tomorrow!"</p>
<p>But at the same time just waiting blankly.</p>
<p>Oh, "Tomorrow"! The new century of "Tomorrow"!</p>
<p>I am going to praise you,</p>
<p>In the "tomorrow" of that new century!</p>

<h3>Random Notes on the Charity Performance for the Hebei Province Flood Relief – Is Zhang Eyun Still Well?</h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>The Yanping Guild Hall, in order to provide relief for the Hebei Province flood disaster, held a three-day performance at the Golden Grand Theatre, starting the night before last. That evening's headlining act was Zhang Eyun's "Scholar Lin's Sacrifice at the Pagoda," and the opening acts included Song Dezhu's "Jinshan Temple," and Wu Yanheng and Yuan Shihai's "Linked Rings."</p>
<p>Wu Yanheng and Yuan Shihai's "Linked Rings" has been performed several times and has been well received. That evening, Wu Yanheng's voice was slightly less smooth, which made the performance less brilliant than the previous times. Although the announcement during "Seeing Peng" still used full strength to win a round of applause, he did not put much effort into the other high notes; his singing was also perfunctory, which was a bit of a pity. As a result, Shihai overshadowed the main performer, and Huang Tianshuang was not as popular as Bao Erba. There are two places in the dialogue of Wu and Yuan that should be corrected. In the "Paying Respects" scene, Yanheng says,</p>
<p>"There are three hundred soldiers and servants in the daytime, and five hundred teachers at night," and Shihai's next line is read as "Not to mention those three hundred servants and two hundred teachers," which is clearly contradictory to what Yanheng said. According to what Yang Xiaolou read, it was indeed "three hundred servants and two hundred teachers." Since Yanheng is a martial arts actor of the Yang school, he should read according to Xiaolou's lines, so this is not Shihai's mistake, but Yanheng's. In the "Stealing the Hook" scene, Shihai reads the words on the knife as "Golden General Huang," which is actually a mistake for "Canal General Huang." Although these two points are minor details, the difference is quite large, and it is hoped that Wu and Yuan can pay attention to them.</p>
<p>After "Linked Rings" was Song Dezhu's "Water Flooding Jinshan Temple." Dezhu's most popular performance here is this play, which has been performed more than ten times, and each time it is sold out. If it were not really good, how could it achieve this? The beautiful costumes, the pleasant Kunqu melodies, and the universal plot are all the main reasons; coupled with the neat coordination, it makes the green leaves all the more able to set off the peony. Dezhu's hand gestures in this play are unpredictable and amazing, and the scene of her dueling with Song Jinsheng is seamless. The headlining act was Zhang Eyun's "Sacrifice at the Pagoda." Eyun performed in Shanghai for a long time this spring and was highly praised by the audience. This time she is making a comeback, and her voice is even brighter than in the spring. The long passage of "Fan Erhuang" is full of excellent melodies, which makes people endlessly savor. Combined with Mu Tiefen's erhu, it is a perfect match. It is heard that Eyun has been invited by Golden Grand Theatre again and will take the stage after Wang Yurong.</p>
<h3>Silver Screen Snippets</h3>

<h3>Brief News from the Arts Circle</h3>
<p>New York Style Radio. The 1940 new-style Elsie Victory New York-style radio is stylish and performs exceptionally well. Among inexpensive radios, it is an unprecedentedly beautiful product. The local American Victory Gramophone Company held an exhibition at its sample room in the Guohua Building on Beijing Road yesterday (the 3rd) at 5:30 PM to publicly demonstrate the radio's performance. At the same time, a sound film was shown, detailing the design and construction of the New York-style radio. People from all walks of life who went to visit were very enthusiastic. The current stock of this radio has been shipped from the United States, and major companies and radio shops have displays. People from all walks of life are welcome to visit and audition without charge.</p>
<p>The Film Association Troupe Stops Performing. The Shanghai Film Association Troupe, organized by film tycoon Zhang Shichuan and others, has been performing dramas at the Lafayette Theater since September 1. As of October 31, it has been two months, and the results have been excellent, and it has been well received by the public. It is said that because the film work of various companies is tight, all actors must concentrate on it, and if they also take care of dramas, it will inevitably affect their own careers. Therefore, the performances have been stopped since November 1. The dramas at the Lafayette Theater will have nothing to do with the troupe in the future.</p>
<h3>"Wang Baochuan" Finally Achieves Success</h3>
<p>— Wen Bo</p>
<p>——Will be Screened at the Grand Shanghai——</p>
<p>After "Wang Baochuan" was translated into English by Xiong Shi'i and performed overseas, it was well received, and the play became a world-famous work. Several years ago, Ms. Tang Ying performed the English "Wang Baochuan" at the Guanglu Grand Theatre, and the results were also remarkable. At that time, Yihua Company planned to put the play on the screen, with Bu Wancang, Shi Dongshan, Ying Yunwei and others co-directing, and the script was sent to the Capital Film Censorship Committee for review and approval. Later, for some reason, it was delayed. After the war, talents were scattered, and the filming of "Wang Baochuan," which was widely publicized, was almost forgotten. This spring, Yihua once again made a grand wish to film "Wang Baochuan." After repeated planning, it finally came to fruition. The director is Wu Cun, who is known for his subtlety, and the protagonist is Zhang Cuihong, a classical beauty, assisted by Li Ying and Diao Banhua, which is truly a masterpiece of the silver screen. Since filming began, it has been quite a long time, because the film will be shipped overseas, and the production must be cautious. It is now heard that the entire film has been completed and will be screened at the Grand Shanghai. This film is expected to attract international attention to Chinese films. Therefore, the release of "Wang Baochuan" is also a valuable achievement in the domestic art scene. The picture shows Zhang Cuihong, Wen Yimin, and Zhao Zhenni performing a scene from "The Three Slaps."</p>
<h3>Dance Troupe Sketches</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Regarding the Dance Girl Association</p>
<p>The other day, I was eating at the Bank Club and ran into Mr. Lin Kanghou. He told me a lot about the organization of the Dance Girl Association and invited me to visit. I am sorry that I did not have the opportunity to visit. On October 29th,</p>
<p>(48) On that day, the association held a dinner and dance at the Lido Ballroom to raise funds. Each guest had a ticket, each ticket was ten yuan, and the dance stars of the association attended the event and danced for free. Shen Weiying was a salesperson, and a group of our friends also bought seven or eight tickets, and we all had to participate in the grand event at that time.</p>
<p>About thirty dancers attended the event that day, and there were more than a hundred dancers. Because the dance was free, the dancers' dances seemed particularly strong, and there was a lot of competition for the few monks. I went with my dance partner, but in order to know more about the association, I often asked the members to dance. I learned that they had already started Chinese and English classes in the association, and there were also sewing and Pingju classes, which were being planned.</p>
<p>Their motivation for organizing this association was because they felt that the time limit of the dance girl profession was too short in the course of life. Usually, they enter the dance girl world at the age of fifteen or sixteen, and they have to find another way out at the age of twenty-five or six. Moreover, among these ten years, the so-called golden age is only from eighteen or nine to twenty-two or three, which is only five years. After these five years, is it difficult to not want to live? Their only way out is to marry. Looking at the social trend, a person who is well-fed all day and never works is gradually becoming unsustainable. Looking at the trend of living standards, it is already very difficult for a person to support a wife and his children. How can they add the burden of an outside room? Moreover, concubinage is illegal. Therefore, in addition to the way out of marriage, they want another real professional way out, so that they can support themselves even after the dance girl era, and it would be even better if they could marry a satisfactory husband and give the other party a kind of help.</p>
<p>They also said to me that some dance hall staff misunderstood their meaning, thinking that they organized this association to fight against the dance hall. In fact, the dance hall and the dance girl should fundamentally hold the purpose of mutual assistance, mutual benefit, coexistence and common prosperity. As long as the dance hall does not use irrational oppression, the dance girls fundamentally have no intention of confrontation. Moreover, if the dance girls can improve their knowledge, they can understand the intention of the dance hall a little more, which is not without some indirect benefits to the dance hall.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of Liyuan</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Strange Story of Wang Yunfang and His Son's Reunion</p>
<p>My grandfather (Yunfang called himself) served as the prefect of Dongchang Prefecture in Shandong, and my father, Bichang, also served as the magistrate of Pingyin County at the end of the Qing Dynasty. My mother, Ms. Si, was the eldest daughter of Mr. He Wangzhi of Hubei. At that time, my maternal grandfather was also an official in Shandong. After my father resigned from office in a certain year, he was greatly stimulated mentally, and because he was troubled by economic problems, he entrusted my mother and me to my maternal grandfather's home, and my father returned to the south alone. At that time, I was only seven years old. Not long after, my mother died of illness. My maternal grandmother loved me very much. My maternal grandfather had nothing to do at home, and taught me to read and write every day. Unfortunately, my maternal grandmother passed away several years later, and my maternal grandfather remarried a certain woman, who treated me very badly. I really couldn't bear it, so I ran away secretly and fled to Cao County, where I was adopted by a certain Mr. Qiu. It was in the third year of the Republic of China. Soon, bandits broke the county town, and Mr. Qiu and I were both captured. After several months, we were released. Mr. Qiu did not dare to stay at home, so he took me to Jinan. Since then, I took the surname Qiu and began to walk in the profession. At that time, the Jinan gentry established the Easy Customs Society to improve opera and recruit talented children. In addition to general education, they also taught drama. At that time, I was already eleven years old, so I joined the society and learned Qingshan. By the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Easy Customs Society was closed down, and my studies had a little foundation, but I still did not dare to go on stage rashly. The clan then went north to Tianjin and Beijing, and studied under Mr. Wang Yaoqing and the famous amateur Mr. Ji Kanru. Later, because the military and political authorities of Xuzhou sent people to Tianjin to invite the famous amateur Wang Yusheng and me to Xuzhou to perform charity performances, and I was also taught by Mr. Su Shaoqing, my art began to improve greatly. Not long after, a certain wealthy family in Shanghai performed a hall performance, and I was praised by the guests for performing the play "Holding and Beating." (133)</p>
