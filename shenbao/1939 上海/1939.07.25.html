<p>（倫敦）今日下院開會、全塲在熱切期待之空氣中、靜聆首相張伯倫發表其對於英日協定之言論、首相謂駐日大使克萊琪爵士與日外相有田在解決天津事件之談判開始前、已自七月十五日起在東京舉行初步談話、日政府於開始討論時、曾表示欲使消除雙方誤會、及樹立兩國更良好之關係上、獲有進步、則殊有承認檢討構成天津局勢之背景之必要、此事與英政府對華政策、並無關係、不過爲事實問題而已、戰事現正在中國大規模進行中、日軍在其佔據區域內、必須謀其自身之安全及維持公共秩序、故不得不探取行動、使此項力量勿遭受妨礙、英政府爲淸除討論天津事件之前途起見、故與日政府商妥下列方案、「英政府完全承認大規模戰事刻在進行中之中國的實况、並承認此種事態長此繼續存在時、在華日軍有特殊之需要、以保障其自己之安蚤與維持其控制區域中之公共秩序、並對於足以妨礙日軍或有利敵人之任何行動或事件、當予以制止或消除、英政府對於任何行動足以妨碍日軍達到上述目的者、並無予以助成之意、並將乘此機會、明白吿知在華英國官憲及僑民、應勿作此項行爲及計畫、以證實英國關於此事所抱之政策」云、</p>
<p>首相宣讀該方案旣畢、共產黨議員加拉轍卽大呼曰、「可恥」、首相繼乃答覆工黨議員佛萊轍之質問、英國在保證談判中並未同意足以損害中國法幣或英國貸款與中國政府以供任何用途之權之任何點、並切言此决談判以天津地方爭案爲限、又答工黨議員漢德森之質問、謂英國所作之讓步、質言之、並非在事實上承認日本武裝軍隊對所佔中國各部分享有主權、又答工黨彭恩之質問、謂渠不欲確切言明何者爲受日人控制影饗之土地、按彭恩曾問曰、「英政府是吾未允應在此區域進行之政策方針、此區域爲何、」首相答曰、「日人控制之區域、」工黨興威爾於是起問、此言是否不含有英政府現已切實與日本沆瀣一氣之意義、保守黨議員皆大呼曰、「否」、保守黨轍埃問、此一答言、是吾不含有英政府保持嚴格的中立之意義乎、工黨格林武欲知英國對華政策是吾已有任何變更、首相答曰、「未、宣言並未含有英政府對華政府作任何變更之義」云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>工黨議員史脫洛斯乃要求首相提供保證、謂中國方面存在天津之白銀、價値二百五十萬鎊、決不交付日本、外務次官勃特勒代表首相答稱、「此項白銀如何處置、日本政府從未作何提議」、工黨議員貝倫傑又問曰、「此項白銀是吾存放英國銀行、又天津局勢阢陧不安、是吾宜將其移置安全地點」、勃特勒决官又答稱、、此項問題請貴議員用書面提出」、工黨議員質文又問曰、「勃特勒次官之意、中國政府豈欲吾國將此項白銀交付日本歟」、勃特勒决官答曰吾、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）　午後十時外務省發表云、有田外務大臣與英國駐日大使之間、自七月十五以來、迭决會談、茲發表結果如决、英國政府完全承認大規模戰鬥行爲在進行中之中國之現實事態、並認識此種狀態存續期間駐華日軍、爲確保其身之安全、且爲維持其勢力下地區之治安、可提出特殊要求、並有排除一切有害於日軍有利於其敵方之行爲及原因之必要、英國政府應明示其駐華官憲及國民、以其無是認日軍於達成上述目的之際、可妨害其行動之任何種行爲或措置之意志、而設有此種行爲爲措置時、當予以控制之旨、用以確認該項政策策（二十四日同盟電）</p>

<h3 id="c4">新綏靖運動 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>國際風雲的變幻，跟這幾天天氣的晴雨炎凉，實相彷彿。自從慕尼黑協定以後，侵略者的攻勢愈益囂張跋扈，歐洲的地圖一再變色，弱小國家日歹自危，英國的信譽一落千丈。張伯倫很堅決的不顧國內外的笑駡，但很不堅決的徘徊於反侵略陣線與綏靖政策之間。</p>
<p>新的「綏靖」運動除對日本妥協之外，在歐洲亦在醞釀之中。據說正在草擬一個有關但澤的「和平」計畫，以「鎭靜」希特勒，同時德國經濟專家華爾特則正與倫敦進行談話。至於遠束，克萊琪和有田在東京的談判，已經成立了初步的讓步，以「改善」倫敦與束京的關係。歐洲與遠束，兩地一體；除中國的抗戰是獨有的光輝而外，其他皆偸偸摸摸於曖昧之中。巴黎某報說「英國在歐洲的地位，將因英日妥洽而加強」，這完全是可憐蟲的聊以自慰，聊以解嘲老實說，在今天東西侵略者已完成了密切的聯繫，東方的妥協，旣鼓勵了束方侵略者的邁進，又誘致了西方的跋扈。遠一些說，慕尼黑屈辱的結果是什麼？是日本的攻取海南島，加緊威脅英法的利益；近一些說，日本封鎖天津英租界的結果是什麼？是希特勒窺伺但澤的加緊，德義反英運動的勃起。而東京的妥協，又必有其後果。</p>
<p>慕尼黑協定是張伯倫綏靖政策的結果，它給人間留下了慘痛的敎訓，它在國際間種下了更大更深的禍根。因此，那對侵略者再度妥協的「新綏靖運動」，除了擴大和加深國際危機，英國再讓步外，便是大戰。據美聯社所傳，法國政界對於張伯倫「新綏靖運動」的企圖，已起了厭惡的反響，他們認爲這種企圖完全不利於法國，「第一，此種新綏靖政策，結果法國之盟友必將相繼背棄；第二，德國在獲得新綏靖政策之實利後，貪饜無窮，又將繼續要求讓步；第三，新綏靖政策如果實施，義國對法之殖民地要求又將復活」。是的，法國在慕尼黑追隨張伯倫的結果，大大地削弱了自已的地位，法國如果要維護自身的利益和安全，必須對那「新綏靖政策」加以堅決的反對。</p>
<p>張伯倫的「新綏靖運動」，對於遠柬雖然有不利的影響，但決不致如侵略者所竊望，會造成「東方慕尼黑」的局面。因爲張伯倫雖想複演慕尼黑的悲劇，而中國堅定的自力抗戰，必然使張伯倫無法導演悲劇。中國雖歡迎任何外力的援助，但並不倚賴外力的援助。因此，即使沒有了外力援助，它也必然會繼續抗戰。何况跟着英國退讓的，決非整個國際。</p>

<p>桂林通訊、桂林位於廣西西北隅、離湖南省不遠、風土人情也大致和湖南相仿、語言也和湖南差不多、但是生氣的蓬勃、精神的煥發、畢竟和湖南不同、就桂林來講、無論城鄕、貧富老少十分之八九是穿的軍裝和有帶的黑布鞋、</p>
<p>生活樸素</p>
<p>呌我們流浪者都過不來、唯其是樸素、對於余錢、當然就非常的看重、廣西全省因爲男子要出征、維持治安、所以鄕耕入市、都是女的多、即使有男的、年齡至少也在五十歲左右、天不亮就挑了一祖柴或米菜進城賣了、再換一担石灰或豬食料等跑回去吃飯、有的吃了飯才進城、所以桂林有上午市和下午市兩次、這兩决上市的時候、人行道上簡直不能行人、近來因爲上午怕有警報、所以下午格外擁擠、夜市至少要到十二時、桂林的山水確實有其不平凡的地方、桂林的山完全是石山、在一塊塊的大石接頭的地方、有很大的古松、有茂盛的小樹叢、同時桂林的山、不像任何地方一樣、慢慢的高起來、慢慢的低下去、完全是東一座、西一座、而這一座一座的山、高得眞可望酸你的頭頸骨、而且一座一座離得很近很近、而這許多山、簡直沒有一座山沒有洞、眞是</p>
<p>山山有洞</p>
<p>這種洞、有通有不通、，大的可容七八萬人、小的至少可容七八十人、每一個山洞、都是天然的防空壕、這種防空壕、任憑你幾千公斤的重磅炸彈向上擲、也很難有辦法炸毀、所以桂林城內房屋雖然被炸很多、但是人口的死傷、却很少很少、不像旁的地方、　去轟炸就是死幾十、傷幾百的、所以每至天晴的上午、帶遊山洞帶避警報的朋友、眞不絕於途、七星岩是桂林最有名的山洞、</p>

<p>（重慶特訊）敎部統計處、近發表「整理大學課程之步驟與辦法」一文如下、</p>
<p>整理課程、非叱嗟可辦之事、故積數年之功、尙未即予頒行、二十七年二月、陳部長到部後、對於課程改進、銳意進行、決定整理課程之原則、爲（一）規定統一標準、（二）注重基本訓練、（三）注重精要科目、曾製定大學文理法三學院各學系課程整理辦法草案、寄請國內各大學敎授專家商酌、頗爲多數人士所贊護、茲錄草案所擬原則如次、</p>
<p>（一）規定統一標準、大學課程向由各校自行規定、得因人地之宜、自由發展、惟各校所定標準、頗不相同、遂致科目互異、程度不齊、失去大學敎育一貫之精神、此决整理大學課程、以建立統一標準爲第一原則、先從規定必修科目入手、選修科目、暫不完全確定、仍留各校斟酌變通之餘地、此種規定、不僅在於提高一般大學課程之水準、且期與國家文化及建設之政策相吻合、</p>
<p>（二）注重基本訓練、各大學現有課程、分系過早、對於一般學術之基本訓練、未能有傑厚之基礎、各科學術相輔以成、本無嚴格之分野、學生專門過早、與深造之道殊不相合、故大學課程、應先注意於學術廣博基礎之培養、文理法各科之最基本學科、定爲共同必修然後專精一科、以求合於由博及的之道、使學生不因專門之研究、而有偏固之流弊、</p>
<p>（三）注重精要科目、一般大學科目設置、不免流於繁瑣、學生所得知識、不免支離龐雜、未盡能提綱挈要、得一科學術之要旨、故今後大學科目之設置、力求統整與集中、使學生對於一種學科之精耍科目、有充分之修養、精密之研討、而有融會貫通之精神、凡偏僻與瑣細之科目、得由學生自習一律不列入大學課程、至整理辦法、原草案列有整理耍項九則云、</p>
<p>一、全國大學各院系必修及選修課程、一律由本部規定、必修科目、須全國一律、選修科目、各校得在本部規定範圍內參照實際需要、酌量損益、</p>
<p>二、大學各學院第一學年注重基本科目、不分學系、第二學年起分系、三四學年、視各院系性質、酌設實用科目、以爲出校後就業之準備、</p>
<p>三、國文及外國文爲基本工具科目、在第一學年終了時、應舉行嚴格考試、國文須能閱讀古今書籍、及作通順文字、外國文須能閱讀各學院所習學科外國文參考書、方得及格、吾則仍須繼續修習、至達上述標準、方得畢業、</p>
<p>（四）各大學仍採用學年制、各學科學習分量、得以學分計算、每一學分、規定敎師須由每週授課一小時、學生須每週自習兩小時、其需要自習時間較多之科目、敎師敎授時間、應减少爲每二學分、每週一小時、</p>
<p>（五）各科敎學、除由敎師上課講習外、對於自習討論、與習作或實騐應同時並重、考試範圍、除敎師講習材料外、亦應包括自習、討論及習作或實騐之材料、</p>
<p>（六）各科目應由敎師祥細規定自習書目、與其他參考資料、督令學生按時閱讀、並作相記、文法學院舉生應研究古今名著、每科一種或數種、課間並宜舉行討論、培養學生獨立研究之精神</p>
<p>（七）各科目須確實規定學生習作或實習决數、凡習作及實習報吿、應由敎師按期批閱、</p>
<p>（八）各學系除規定學生注重平時習作外、並應在高年級課程中、規定重要科目數種、指導學生作學科論文、其題目應由敎員指定或核定、</p>
<p>（九）學生畢業考試、應包括各院系四學年中重要科目、其科目種類、得由各校自行規定、但須有五種以上、</p>
<p>由於上述要項、遂分課程爲（一）共同必修、（二）各系必修、（三）各系選修三類、其整理編訂之進行步驟、擬訂如决、（一）調查全國各大學各院系科目、加以分析研究、（二）請各大學敎授發表意見、並擬訂各學系之理想科目表目（三）根據各校實際情形、參酌各敎授意見、邀請專家分別擬具右列草案、一、文·理·法·工·農·商·師範各學院分院共同必修科目表草案、二、各學系分系必修及選修科目表草案、（四）將各學院分院共同必修科目表草案、寄請專家及院長敎務長若干人審查、開會討論、通過後頒發各校試行、（五）將各學系分系必修及選修科目表草案、寄請同系專家數人審查、（六）將原草案及審查意見、發交各院校轉各系敎授講師開會討論、發抒意見、（七）根據各院系發表意見、重新釐訂草案、召集大學課程分院討論會、決定分系科目表、發交各院校試行、（八）以二十八年度爲各大學學院試行新訂課程時期、限二十九年秋將試行結果、及所擬各科目綱要報部、（九）二十九年秋、召集第二屆大學課程討論會、根據試行結果、修訂科目、並制定大學課程綱要、（十）曰民國三十年起、實行規定課程、以後每五年修訂一次、（十）（一）各專科學校課程、自二十八年秋開殆編訂、其進行步驟與大學課程整理辦法同、</p>

<h3 id="c48">謠諑已成過去　滬巿金融轉穩定　各銀行收進新存款不少　外匯價格已達最低水準 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>近日市面謠言極盛、有謂財政部將頒佈新部令、再度限制提存者、有謂某某等銀行、將撤退上海者、遂致人心極爲不安、記者以此特訪銀行界某權威、探詢眞相、據云、財政部馬電原意、爲緊縮通貨、防止外匯投機及套買、不料反引起奸人造謠、紛紛向銀行提存、現提存風潮、早已過去、各銀行且收進新存款不少、不過目前市面通貨、仍感過度緊縮之苦、財政部自不致再行限制提存、引起無謂之紛擾、至現在外匯暴縮、可以减少進口貨物、使外匯之需要大减、且以市面通貨緊縮、外匯價格、已達最低水準、自不致再縮、此係供求關係、簡而易明者也、</p>
<p>外滙趨穩</p>
<p>上海外匯黑巿、自經平準外匯基金委員會維持後、英商匯豐銀行對各業正當需要仍予儘量供給、因此外匯黑市價格轉趨穩定、昨晨匯豐銀行掛牌英匯四便士、美匯七元七五、與上星期六掛牌相同、實際行市英匯爲四便士牛、美滙八元七五、已見轉鬆、旋又因日商銀行猛扒、外匯價格又轉緊、惟因紗花帮趁緊、復起傾塞、故日行雖猛扒、但價格並未十分緊縮、</p>
<p>金價變動</p>
<p>黃金暗市集會處、昨晨九時開做後、開盤時抬高至三千八百三十元、</p>
<p>旋即步瀉至三千五百元、上午收盤爲三千六百元、下午收盤爲三千五百五十元、各銀樓大同行昨晨掛牌初為三百五十元、旋改為四百元、最後爲三百六十元、一日之中、掛牌改掛六七次之多、</p>
<p>證券低落</p>
<p>證券暗市、因中中交農四行對七月底到期之統一公債本息、允予貼現抵借後、統一各債回漲甚烈、咋晨因報載英日妥協消息、投機者又造謠、致價格回跌、收盤甲種五十元零四角、跌一元六角五分、乙種四十二元一角、跌一元九角、丙種四十一元一角五分、跌一元八角五分、丁種四十元零二角、跌一角、戊種四十元零八角五分、跌二元、關於匯劃貼水行市、昨日爲二百五十元、</p>
<p>日紗打擊</p>
<p>大陸報去、據「中國新聞與意見彙刋」昨日（廿三日）批評稱、法幣滙價低落、衆信乃對日本紗廠之重大打擊、因日方不能傾銷其棉紗於本埠市塲與侵佔區中之其他部份也、目前上海日商經營之紗錠、不下一百三十萬錘、而華商經營者、僅的五十萬錘、日人發華興鈔與軍用票而獲得法幣、購買大量外棉、木年度最初五個月、達五千九百萬元以上、六倍於去年同期輸入之外棉、並用上海之低廉勞工、將大量外棉製成棉紗、傾銷於中國市塲、獲利至巨、受害者則爲華人、今法幣價値旣落、日方紗廠將發現購買外棉、所費甚昂、而使彼等難與土製棉紗相競爭、</p>

<p>銀行業·錢業、前爲限制提存、鞏固法幣基礎起見、會聯合巿商會及中中交三行、洋商銀行公會等、合作籌備、實行新匯劃制度、除將各組委員人選分別推定外、並額定此新匯劃籌碼總數爲國幣五千萬元、據悉各行莊支配之數額、今已完全決定、華商商業銀行已定爲二千五百萬元、中中交三行共爲一千五百萬元、錢業爲一千萬元、共爲五千萬元、</p>
<p>銀行配定四千萬元</p>
<p>銀行業同業公會所屬會員、除有一部份爲國營銀行、其餘均爲民營之商業銀行、此决之新匯劃制度、匯劃票準備之籌碼總額、雖已積極實行分配工作、但各行亦須於此時提供擔保品、予以匯劃票總額之擔保、據銀行界鉅子昨語大光社記著、商業銀行之二千五百萬元、近今已支配將竣、擔保品各行均於書面中加以說明、國營銀行之一千五百萬元、由中中交三行分配、公會方面、不必負分配之責、</p>
<p>錢業通吿支配千萬</p>
<p>錢業同業公會所屬會員莊計有四十餘家、現對新匯劃制度之實行、事前必須將此額定之一千萬元、加以分別、徵詢支配、與銀行由公會代爲支配之手續不同、昨據大光社記者探悉、該錢業公會、近因新匯劃實行在即、咋已由公會當局分別通吿各會員莊、徵詢需要之籌碼頭寸、一俟報吿到會、即可彙集總額、及應具之擔保品說明、書面通知審查會、俾各莊使用此新票時、隨時可依據審查、</p>
<p>嚴限附具擔保物品</p>
<p>新匯劃籌碼總額、旣已支配將竣、然各行莊對於出票權能內應附具可靠之擔保品、此擔保品之嚴格、即求固該匯劃票之信用、使各業一致深信、流通市面、按擔保品之物品、已限定爲現金·現銀·道契·有價證舞·商品貨物·等等、再經過審查會之據票審查、然後方准將票流通、</p>
<p>領用手續較前革新</p>
<p>新滙劃實行、較之以前支票本票、信用尤爲堅强、如支票時有退票、本票亦多限以使用期限、而此種新票、錢業方面雖仍如前樣、但一經收票人對照、即可隨時使用銀行錢莊可持票付予外商銀行、並可持票向中中交三行轉賬、預料今後奸人破壊幣政之企圖、已乏術施用、其原因乃一致不可提現及套買外匯、</p>
<p>領取存款悉照定章</p>
<p>又關於滙劃票據之支付問題、外界眞相不明、謠言甚多、特探得詳情如後（一）八一三以前之存款、依照財部安定金融辦法辦理、無論定期活期存款、除公司行號確因有商業需要、得付給同業匯劃外、其餘私人堂記、概不得絲毫通融、以杜流幣、（二）八一三以後之存款、均依照財政部馬電規定辦理、即自六月二十二日起、支付存款除發放工資者外、每週支取數目在五百元以內者、照付法幣、超過五百元者、以匯劃支付、專供同業轉賬之用、但並無限制支付匯劃情事、</p>

<p>華北地名之鈔票、自經中交兩行對於零星少數儘量收兌後、已漸見平定、現聞兩行為防止投機者取巧、並鼓勵資金流入內地起見、已本總行通知、改訂辦法兩則如下、（一）凡以中交津魯地名及交行漢券來兌者一律以原發行地或以重慶付款之即期滙票付給、（二）爲便利持券人向內地採辦土貨起見、並得酌量收匯內地、經此措施之後、想對於已持有華北漢口鈔票者、得一疏解辦法、而搬運鈔票到滬者、亦將無利可圖也、</p>
<p>各行考慮疏通辦法</p>
<p>各銀行現正在考慮疏通辦法、聞新華銀行信託部、刻已受若干國貨廠商及內地學校之委旗、代為辦理購貨　及交納學費　調撥工作、故凡有款項匯至重慶·昆明·貴陽·桂林·及平津等內地者、均可照市滙率優予申水、最近更收受華北漢口鈔票匯款、如以華北漢口鈔票整數往兌者、亦可通融照各該地匯水收受、以際此內地土產登塲之時、廠商中極多須持現鈔往內地收貨、如各銀行能同樣辦理、則內地匯兌困難、可稍見鬆動、而於漢口華北鈔票在市上之流通性、亦得帮助不少、</p>

<p>法租界方面已特殊戒備</p>
<p>愛多亞路長耕里一百三十號中美日報及大晚報所在地、於上星期六下午八時半、突被持有盒子砲手溜彈等武器之暴徒二十餘名、分乘雲飛汽車四輛駛至、意圖衝入該兩報施行暴行、因中美日報之茶役吳某機警、立將鐵門關閉、致暴徒等無法侵入中美日報、於是即各出武器、向中美報射擊、一面復侵入大晚報之排字房、</p>
<p>實施搗毀</p>
<p>工作、同時亦開槍亂擊、其時附近站崗之中西捕及總巡捕房、已聞警報、立由大批中西探捕馳抵出事處所、對暴徒等予以包圍、因彼輩挾槍抗拒、於是探捕等遂亦出槍轟擊、一時子彈紛飛、槍聲密如聯珠、而有一批暴徒、竟爲乘間逃出包圍綫、乘原車一二二三五號汽車</p>
<p>疾馳飛逃</p>
<p>乃逃經漢口路浙江路口、又値老閘捕房中西捕之巡查隊、於是又造成第二次之惡鬥、總計雙方開槍達二百餘響、因流彈而死傷者計達二十三名之多、其中三死、二十一傷、死者中一人、係英人、各情已詳本報、當時總巡捕房西探長毛亞·華探長廖貴龢·探目康增祥·高振等、在</p>

<p>西報詳述前後經過</p>
<p>字林報云、星期六日晚恐怖份子在愛多亞路從事暴行結果、中央與老閘兩捕房之探員已獲得山薯形手溜彈十一顆、新式自動盒子砲六支、空彈壳的二百枚、而於昨日畫夜盤詰當時在塲之嫌疑犯·目證·及巡捕、盡力偵查此案、據所能確知者、此决暴行、組織嚴密、惟結果失敗、今疑團已稍明、顯見除星期六日晚將近八時十五分、分乘雲飛汽車四輛抵江西路之二十人以外、復有</p>
<p>大批同黨</p>
<p>及所謂「望風」者、駐守各要點、對付派駐附近之每一巡捕、恐怖份子分三批而入愛多亞路一百三十弄、即「泰晤士大樓旁之長耕里、英商「大晚報、」美商「中美日報」館址、及英文　大陸報之印刷房、均在該衖、暴徒之意、顯在搗亂上述各報館、</p>
<p>見人開創</p>
<p>並盡其所能毀壊機器、俾阻諸報之出版、閣入泰晤士大樓二樓大晚報之恐怖份子、計十餘人、開槍多響、擊斃排字工人一名、另有十餘暴徒闖入三樓「中美日報」館、惟因門已下鍵、被阻不得入內、另一隊暴徒闖入相對泰晤士大樓之通匯信託公司、該公司之年老茶役一名企圖在</p>
<p>武裝暴徒</p>
<p>前閉門、而被擊斃、同時各暴徒已感驚惶、狼狽退入長耕里、折向愛多亞路、奔時朝天開槍、並揮動手溜彈、當時已有手溜彈一枚擲出、另一彈在泰晤士大樓前爆發、恐怖份子逸入法租界者頗衆、法租界各馬路中已檢得</p>
<p>槍機槍彈</p>
<p>而大多數暴徒則竄入江西路、擲出第三枚手溜彈、至少有一批暴徒在該路登其汽車、馳返歹土、」惟至漢口路遇巡捕搜查隊、暴徒所佔之四輛汽車中、其二巳發現棄於法租界、第三輛在漢口路被巡捕擊中五彈、而不能行駛、由星期六日</p>
<p>暴行方法</p>
<p>可知此輩暴徒即六月十六日在寗波路一百三十號導報編輯室作相類暴行之恐怖份子、似無疑義、再、似可確定者、星期六日暴徒所用之手溜彈、與七月十六日晨在南京路發現之手溜彈兩顆相同、該兩彈或係恐怖份子於最後片刻决定擲之、過份危險、而棄於該地者、同時、大批嫌疑犯已經</p>
<p>眞密鞫詢</p>
<p>負責辦理是案之警務人員昨對此案、拒不披露任何消息、惟聞刻仍被覊之嫌疑犯僅四名、其中大多會犯罪案、均係江北籍、然星期六日之事、實可令人震驚、而亦本市罕見之勇敢的表現、因心臟部份中彈而於星期六日夜九時三十分殞生之威爾森、於出事時方在槍擊地馬路對面之酒肆中</p>
<p>照料顧客</p>
<p>聞聲馳往門首、擬越馬路協助巡捕、其友人加以阻止勸其弗冒被槍擊之險、然惠氏仍擺脫友人之緊握、而馳向長耕里、當惠氏將到達時、槍彈十五響向渠擊出、威氏遂受重傷、擬盡其量後之力、馳越馬路返酒肆、然至馬路中央</p>
<p>頹然踣矣</p>
<p>法兵一名蛇行至受傷之威氏旁、親冒大危險、設法曳彼至法租界方面、召救護車飛送醫院、華籍探員一名、時已中彈、倒臥血泊中、顯有被巡捕擊中之可能、然仍一手執槍、手揚其探員證、向竄逃之暴徒轟擊、至暴徒逸去而後已、該探員亦經飛送醫院、西捕頭威杜遜時在附近、亦冒</p>
<p>生命之險、奔入長耕里、擒獲現被覊押之嫌疑犯之一、該犯被擒時、雙手持盒子砲與手溜彈各一、繼起之漢口路互轟中、率領搜査隊之見習西捕頭慈布夫洛斯基頗爲勇敢、雖在暴徒之射程中、仍於確定不致傷害行人時始發槍轟擊、而復捕獲嫌疑犯兩名、華捕一名於暴徒出衖時手槍被刦、雖</p>
<p>衆寡懸殊</p>
<p>仍加追逐、致右膝中彈踣地者、亦應予以特別注意、探員旣在辦公室中忙碌工作、而警務處後備隊巡捕則自星期六日夜八時三十分起至昨晨八時、不斷搜查各旅館與槍擊地點、俾繼續抄査彈械、受傷諸人之傷勢、仍無變化、其中三人受傷甚重、餘者雖須治療、然均受輕傷、巴萊斯咖啡館之十九歲</p>

<p>要求押回</p>
<p>覊禁、駐華美法庭騐屍官魯登與執行吏康佩爾、昨晨檢騐威爾森屍體、而准移往萬國殯儀館、定今晨十時三十分開審此案、關於暴徒獲得汽車四輛事之詳情、昨日亦已查得、似係暴徒之一、於將近八時、往億定盤路雲飛車行租得汽車四輛、自乘第一輛</p>
<p>後隨三車</p>
<p>駛往諸安浜衖、七月七日字林報已載該衖設有武器精良之暴徒的一百五十人之總機關、且七月二日警務處搜查隊即係在該浜被開槍射擊者、四車駛抵該衖後、即有二十人左右入車、令車夫駛往江西路、槍擊案於是開始、暴黨係受擁護某方之團體指使而出此、此說雖未獲證實、然</p>
<p>似可確定</p>
<p>昨據一般人之意見、關於特機罪犯從億定盤路及其他界馬路隨意入公共租界事、警務處將向「大道」當局堅決交涉、兩華人被擊斃事、定今晨開審、聞受傷嫌疑犯之傷勢、尙稱滿意、足仟偵查此案之探員加以鞫訊、英文大美晚報云、法租界警務處刻取</p>
<p>特殊戒備、以防重演如星期六日晚發生於愛多亞路之恐怖份子襲擊事件、派出流動鐵甲車兩輛、駐守大美晚報館外、並在暴徒設有總機關之億定盤路附近海格路上架置鐵絲綱、公共租界警務處亦在警戒中、已加緊其巡邏辦法、</p>

<p>不足重視且已結束、渠令「大道」警察離公共租界馬路者、因彼等無武裝駐立該地之權云、華特遜方在警局中被惡待時、該局發電話致另一「大道」警局、要求加派警察、遂有增援之「大道」警察乘卡車一輛</p>

<h3 id="c79">「幽默」重提 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 消人</p>
<p>這說來已經像是老話了，幾年前，我們曾經轟的一聲在提倡「幽默」，似乎連喫飯睡覺都非「幽默」一下不可。然而結果除了譯幾條蕭伯納語錄，重抄幾段「笑林廣記」而外，却是甚麼也沒有留下。</p>
<p>當時也曾經有人反對過，說「幽默」並不能到處都是，於是舉出子路臨死時繫好帽子上帶子的故事，以爲像那樣的「幽默」決不是任何人可以舉行來的。——但這還是不懂「幽默」的人所說的話。</p>
<p>「幽默」並不是蒼蠅，這是極不錯的。但子路底故事却又實在不是「幽默」的例子。我們過去的「讀書人」臨死時總要表明自己底身分，像曾子的「易簧」，以及後來許多「忠臣」在死節時先穿好朝服的儀式，就都是這一類的行爲。要把這種故事也認爲是「幽默」，那「幽默」倒好像是我們底國產了，到頭勢必還成了蒼蠅。實在提倡「幽默」的，和反對提倡的，都一樣的是「幽默」的外行。</p>
<p>無論如何，「幽默」不是我們這裏的出產。我們一向講的是「禮」，不想正經也得裝出正經，實在沒有地方安置「幽默」。等到不講「禮」的時候，則有一聲「媽的！」可以喝退一切。再「文」一點，也只有揭穿陰私的醜話，佔小便宜的笑話，俏皮雖然有時也俏皮的，但那藝術却是越肉麻越合式。這正是「禮」賜給我們的後果：越是受了「禮」的長期的束縛，便越是要走到「非禮」的一面。這說明了我們始終沒有「幽默」。</p>
<p>因爲沒有，所以纔要提倡。——話是對的，可是事實却不成。「幽默」的產生，是在文化較高的地方，同時也在生活較閒適的地方。文化，我們就丟開不說也罷，單是生活閒適，我們先就難有這條件。然而「幽默」又不是勉强可以裝得像的。而且就是裝得像，賞鑒的人還是少得很。大部分人都在爲餓着的肚子緊張，那裏還有工夫去玩味「幽默」？「幽默」作家所以終於不能在我們中間出世，「幽默」的提倡者所以終於只有抱住蕭伯納和「笑林廣記」，實在也是必然的。</p>
<p>但這不是不說我們眼前簡直就沒有「幽默」的影子了？那却又不。「幽默」實在還是有的，不過却不是提倡出來的，也不是故意裝出來的。那倒是當事者板起面孔來做事，一點沒有想到「幽默」上面去，而恰恰却露出了「幽默」的作風。但這要你會看，——就是說，要你知道看法。</p>
<p>這種「幽默」和故意做的「幽默」恰恰相反，越是時代緊張，倒越會多了起來。原因是有些上等人會被時代的飛速變化弄得手忙脚亂，於是便不斷地會有妙事出現。譬如某教授在會議席上主張什麼不近人情的事，被全場反對得沒有辦法的時候，却指着匾額上的某某兩個字，說他是因爲看見了那個匾額的緣故。又譬如栽作家總在誇着自己的不問政治，不親黨派，但忽然却在某種刊物上大寫文章，等到有人質問了，却說：「我心裏並沒有政治和黨派！」——像這一類的妙事，只要你留意，包你可以收集一些。誰敢說這些不是最高標準的「幽默」呢？</p>
<p>較大一點的事也有的，例如蘇州不許說書的說「征東」，這不但超出了一般「幽默」的水準，而且實在是不世出的奇聞，不管是怎樣有天才的「幽默」大師，也沒有本領可以做得出來。</p>
<p>曾經提倡「幽默」的中心刊物「論語」，現在已經看不見了。但「論語」社出版的「幽默文選」却還有許多躺在舊書攤上被當作廢紙出賣。看見了那書精美的裝釘和潔白的紙張，眞呌人未免有可惜之感。我不知道那般曾經提倡過「幽默」的名人是否還有志於此，倘是沒有灰心，我看還是轉變轉變，不要談「文」，且來論「事」，最好把歷來的「幽默」事輯起來編兩本「幽默事選」，倒要切實得多。這不是「抗戰八股」，似乎於「性靈」也無大碍。「幽默家」以爲何如？</p>
<h3 id="c80">滿江紅愛國詞百首 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>新近看到李宗鄴的「滿江紅愛國詞百首」，商務版，乃學生國學叢書之一，從岳飛選起，中經南宋張孝祥陳亮劉克莊辛棄疾劉過，宋末文天祥，明末張煌言吳易錢肅樂，淸末秋瑾梁啟超，一直選到近人胡漢民柳亞子，旣有意義，又極別致。</p>
<p>爲了喜愛這書，我就發了一個傻勁，費數日之力，逐頁翻檢「淸名家詞」一百種，又得到李宗鄴所不曾收入的幾首：</p>
<p>（一）武進董兀凱的蒼梧詞有一首「過金沙寺爲岳鄂王題壁處敬和原韻」云：「擐甲投戈，過蕭寺晨鐘甫歇。想當日衝冠怒髪，滿懷忠烈。劍氣夜寒陽羨草，筆光陣掃金沙月。拂殘碑遺恨對西湖，同悲切。○淮北恥，終難雪，淮西議，終難滅。歎黃龍未飲，甌還缺。潭水秋吟名士句，冰天淚灑英雄血。看陰陰松柏向南枝，朝雙闕。」此外還有一首「拜岳鄂王墓敬和原韻」和一道「拜於忠肅公墓」，不贅錄。（二）武進趙懷玉的秋籟吟第一首就是「岳鄂王墓次韻」，詞云：「十二金牌，風波起雄圖竟歇。千載後我來憑弔，尚餘激烈。朔騎不嘶春隴草，杜鵑還呌南枝月。與諸君痛飲　黃龍，平生切傷北伐，　難雪。歸北寺，寃難滅。歎長城壞後，水殘山缺。三尺馬金魑魅像，一坯黃土英雄血。看宋家遺骨記冬靑，空陵關。」</p>
<p>（三）嘉興馮登府的種蕓仙館詞有一首「題石砫天人秦良玉像」云：「百戰河山，有幾個蛾眉燕額？撐半壁夫人城在，風雲陣黑。白桿金戈仙檄地，明妝鐵騎朝天日。看丹靑先畫美人圖，弓鞋窄。○靑犢恨，雲陽厄。翠袖斷，總州策。想　容盛鬋，平臺顏色。王帳夜談泰　月，綿袍腥染狠河血。歎國殤，兒女盡英雄，經蘭泣。」（紅蘭，良玉之媳）</p>
<p>（四）臨桂王鵬　的半塘定稿有一道「敬書岳忠武王贈吳將軍寶刀行墨　後」云：「雷雨空堂，驚晨卷龍蛇起　。瞻拜處聚然如見，劍光盈　。願氣縱橫山欲憾，交情鄭重杯相　。想夜　盾墨灑淋漓，歌　哭。○暗鳴氣，悲凉曲。千萬　循環讀。歎王刀可假，何處　辱！悵望千秋人不見，相尋一轍東還覆。問誰歟雪涕和哀歌？燕台筑」。還有一首「朱仙鎭謁岳鄂王祠敬賦」，不具錄。</p>
<p>李選在排列上，晚宋的文辛棄疾劉過等之前，似爲前後倒置。又，董榕條註中，謂蔣士銓的「桂林霜」爲愛國劇，但意義實與同人的「冬靑樹」不盡同，因爲桂林霜所寫的是漢軍鑲紅旗人馬雄鎭爲淸空盡忠，比較上是次要的。</p>
<h3 id="c81">旌旗之夢 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>一羣給痛苦折磨得憔悴了的羣眾，臉上掛一幅光輝的笑，笑隱藏着眼淚，圍成一堵牆，鐵的心，澎湃的洪流。不懂事的孩子，伸出手，任意却又親曠地撥弄刀槍上的櫻絡的金黃色的光，在和暖媚的太陽下眨眼。紅的虎鬚，飄在刀槍上，斧鋮上，洋出絲絲的笑。笑聲裏蜜的供奉獻與千千萬萬顆虔誠的心。每人完成了莊嚴不渝的祈禱。多年來過度的警惕，減少了享受與睡眠。給天涯的流亡人祝福，給艱苦的時代中鐵一般的勇士祝福，他們的心變得憔悴了。地獄中多年的寒冷，他們不相信有今天，他們會看見夢中的旌旗</p>
<p>這是夢？</p>
<p>過渡的歡喜或哀愁，慣常使人疑惑的，說這不是現實而是夢境。的確，我們也過分愛這一個夢，我們愛他，追求他，抓取他，不放他從手中逃脫。有這末一天，夢來了。歡喜的疑雲，把旌旗塗抹上一層黃昏，夢的顏色，迷離的象微。我們硬把歡喜塗抹上疑雲。馱上一堆厚厚的日月，盼望，焦慮和苦思，勾下許多曉月凄清的輪廓，從舊夢中相逢，又在破曉晴明時偶遇，你該說這是夢，是逼眞？</p>
<p>多謝我旅途的經歷，有幾次機緣，讓我享受到這眞夢之間的甜蜜。你沒有理由說這是夢。然而你是過度的興奮了。歡喜多疑雲。我雖然不喜歡夢，但我在趕到一個荒廢的城堞時，我看到旗桿上懸掛的一幅旗給狂風吹得獵獵作響，個儻地招展着，我的確疑惑那會是夢。破敗的小山上，有一羣兵士在做飯，炊烟裊裊上升。你該說這不是夢？多美妙的旌旗，多好聽的號角。夢我知道那不是。愉快是逼眞的，但是呵，我曾馱着一堆旌旗的夢，跋涉過多悠長的光陰的。從舊夢中來，又從現實中邂逅。我覺得旌旗太可愛了。我願意有一個美妙的享受。讓夢中的手驚詫地觸碰着旄頭，給重逢祝福，給流亡人祝福，也給歸來的鬥士祝福。我該驚奇而又讀歎地說：「道是我們別離後的旌旗了呵。」</p>
<p>呵該給重逢的一羣人祝福，爲了一竿旗幟，許多人埋葬了鮮紅的心，在泥土上，培成自由的花朶。踏過血肉與屍骸，倔强而又獷悍地栽定了他們最前的旗幟。有許多人在孤立無援時，，讓他們迫促的呼吸陪伴着，廝守着旌旗。每人都有一個旌旗的夢。年輕的熱情人跋涉山川，爲了找尋他們的愛戀，讓風沙吹老了年齡。蟄居在「絕緣島」上的，爲了找尋他們的愛戀，他們曾屢次受到不幸和侮辱，牽絆於葛藤。僵冷在地獄中的，交付出他們的酸辛，間關旅途的，也訴說出他們的辛苦和憔悴。塗滿了旌旗的是眼淚，從夢中來，馱上一堆厚厚的日月，充滿盼望，焦慮和苦思，我又在現實中邂逅了。</p>
<p>我記得很分明從夢中來，臉上也還帶着追求的喘急和角逐的緊張。我們又看見別後的旌旗了。你該說這多麼美。沒有淚，沒有愁，有的是光輝和歡笑。雖然他憔悴些，但也更長育些，一次災難把他磨練得更潑刺了。</p>
<p>在學校，在市街，在廣場，在江面，在風吹草低的塞外，在紅豆生長的南國，在莽蒼無際的海邊，在高山大川的發源地，像穹廬一樣覆罩着廣大的四野，我們隨處看得見熟習的旌旗。</p>
<p>多謝這一次幸福的重逢。我給一羣人祝福，給追求，抓取那旌旗的人祝福。</p>
<p>「這是我們別離後的旌旗了呵！」</p>

<p>— 高爾基著　狄周譯</p>
<p>她們冷靜的，很認眞的望着他，可是從她們的眼色裏却很難窮究她們究竟對瓦西卡作何感想。阿玖斯尼亞，幫着鴇母的忙，給他穿上外套；所有的姑娘都在廚房裏裝着憂鬱的，晦澁的臉孔，靜默着。</p>
<p>『再會！』瓦西卡立刻把頭低下去，不望姑娘們的臉，說，『再……會！』</p>
<p>她們中有幾個默默點頭和他作別，可是他沒有看見這。但麗達却小聲的說：</p>
<p>『再會，瓦西里·米落內支，再會……再會……』</p>
<p>醫生助手和院丁扠住瓦西卡的腋下，從板凳上把他扶起來，帶出門外去了。但他又回過頭來向姑娘們再招呼一下：</p>
<p>『再會……我……眞是——什麼都……』</p>
<p>又有兩三個人回應着：</p>
<p>『再會，瓦西里……』</p>
<p>『一切不必費心！』他搖搖頭，臉上露出完全不像他的那種表情。</p>
<p>『再會！看基督的臉上……他的……那個……』</p>
<p>『帶走了！他是一個好人呀……』阿玖斯尼亞倒在板凳上，悲傷的嗚咽起來。</p>
<p>瓦西卡抖着，仰着頭，眼裏奇異地發着光。他很注意的聽着嗚咽聲，站了下來，顫着嘴唇小聲的說道：</p>
<p>『眞是，蠢女人！多麼蠢的女人！』</p>
<p>『走吧！走吧！』醫生助手皺着眉，催促着。</p>
<p>『再會，阿玖斯尼亞！請你到醫院來……』瓦西卡大聲的說。</p>
<p>可是阿玖斯尼亞繼續嗚咽着。</p>
<p>『你幹麼丟下我呢？』</p>
<p>姑娘們圍住她，望着她的臉和眼中流出的眼淚。</p>
<p>麗達俯在她的身上，粗暴的安慰她道：</p>
<p>『啊？你傷心什麼呢！他不會死啊！是，到他那邊去吧，……是，明天去得啦……』（完）</p>

<h3 id="c84">異哉所謂「中國醫學藝術論」（三） <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 宋大仁</p>
<p>經騐不可憑</p>
<p>丁先生說：中醫之成就憑經騐，張先生也說中國醫學在陰陽學說發生之前早已有其經騐，似乎經騐是很可貴的；可是經騐—不是科學的的實騐—不過是人類本能的發現，一切文野民族，甚至一般動物，亦皆具有這種經騐，並不是中醫所特別提倡的價値。况且經騐更是一件小可憑的東西，丁先生舉了老漁航海與弓箭手爲例，他說：「差不多每一個老漁航海都能在事前警吿，何時將有巨風，大浪或暴雨，天文家亦發出同樣警吿，而所得結果亦同」，又說：「我們不難在書本上看到有百發百中的弓箭手，——是不是每個人練習了能百發百中？亦不能，……我們很明白，近世大砲的射的準確，……是不是每個人練習了都能射的準確，是能，爲什麼能，因爲大砲的準確，是憑儀器的，儀器把角度算準了，射的就一定準確」，云云。那末現在旣已有天文家對於天氣轉變的預測，在幾日前就報吿出來，絲毫不錯；大砲射程，可以用精密的幾何三角算法從事測量，自然百發百中。我們爲什麽偏要放棄科學家賜予的恩物——科學工具，拚命去憧憬着這種不足爲憑的經騐，執迷不悟呢？你要曉得科學是學了沒有不會的道理，這種經騐却要到「老」才能得到，還不定是準確的。讓我舉出幾個「經騐不合事實」的例來，恐怕張先生和丁先生看了不能不承認罷！</p>
<p>依亞利斯多德的原理，所有物體降落的速率，皆因牠們的重量之輕重而有遲速，我們經騐所得也是如此，從來沒有人吾認過的；可是經格利略氏（Galilex）的試騐，就證明其不確。有一天他當着學校全體和市民之前，跑到Pisa，斜塔頂上去，帶着兩個鐵球，一重一磅，一重一百磅；他將兩球放在箱子裏，把箱子倒轉過來，使兩球同時下墜，却見得兩球並行而下，到末了鏗然一聲，同時落在地面，於是古人的傳說，因此而被證明是完全錯誤的了。其實物體降落之速率如何，要看牠對於空氣阻力的抵抗而定的。</p>
<p>還有古來的觀天者，看了「日東出而西沒」這種現象，就經騐出一個「天動地靜」之說，這是千眞萬確歷幾千年而從來沒有種經騐，完全是顚倒事實，大謬無當的瞎話，成爲中國天文史上一段大笑話。</p>
<p>這種經騐的對不對，橫豎與人體無關，還沒有多大要緊，這裏我要把中醫的人體經騐來講一講：譬如像濕癬這一類病，無論中醫或是一般病人，幾幾乎沒有一個不曉得牠的病因是濕，衆口同聲，各無異詞的，那裏有錯的道理。他們的根據，因爲到了生病的時候，這個癬就不癢了，本來是濕的，現在也變得不濕了，那末一定是濕氣蘊藏起來在裏面作怪，這是純粹的經騐，大家信奉而不疑的；——可憐！到現在竟還有人信奉——但是事實並不如此，大凡頑固的皮膚病，在人體寄生已久，牠的發癢和分泌，已經等於正常現象，如果害上了別的病，細胞受了別種病因的影響，這個發癢和分泌工作，却停止了，與什麼濕不濕，實在是毫不相干；所以但根據了病的現象，用粗疎皮相的覜察，便斷定牠是濕的作怪，這種因果倒置的謬論，實在是不可為訓的。</p>
<p>還有腹痛症的病原，實有種種，有的起因於胃腸各部之癌腫，潰瘍，以及膽石，肝臟疾患，或其他各種寄生蟲症等，決不是什麼肝氣，胃氣，寒痛，熱痛，這種無根臆測之談，捕風捉影，可以硬定是非的。過去已經不曉得有多少健全的臟器，寃屈在神通廣大的中醫手指之下；把眞眞的病灶，却隨便放過，由牠蔓延滋長，以至不可收拾，這種藝術的經騐（？）實在萬萬要不得。要是他們能够運用其藝術的經騐，有以實指患者之病灶所在及其病變形態，或能鑑別病原是屬於何種細菌原蟲之作怪；那末科學新醫豈有不心悅誠服甘拜下風之理，祇是可惜中醫無此驚天地泣鬼神的大藝術，恐怕就是讓他們再經騐幾千年幾萬年下去，也斷斷經騐不出來的，這又有什麼辦法呢？</p>

<h3 id="c85">食物中毒簡談 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 章詩賓</p>
<p>凡可食的物品，我人食了以後，即因此而起的中毒，統稱爲食物中毒。簡括的分別起來，尙含有下述的三種小同意義：</p>
<p>（一）食物的自身已經變質，食後因遂發生中毒者。</p>
<p>（二）食物的自身，雖毫無變化，而其中則混有能發生中毒的物質者。</p>
<p>（三）食物雖正常並無變化，且屬優良的物品，而食者對於此食品，有起中毒的特異質者。</p>
<p>對於第一項的情形，為食物中毒中最多而亦最普通者，我人時可在報章中見之，而中毒食物的最多者，允莫過於海鮮。因爲我們日常在菜市中所購買的海鮮，都是死的而沒有活的，但死後經過時間久暫，不能不十分注意，雖有幾種海鮮，可以見其變色和聞其腥臭，不難辨別，每以販戶的善於渲染或買客的貪圖便宜，極易受欺。要之可供我人充做食物的海鮮，死後經過相當的時日，必起多少的變質。縱使貯藏於冷藏室內，亦不過較緩發生變化而已。苟食此已經變質的食物，屢屢有發生腹痛，下痢，噯氣，甚則嘔吐，頭痛，眩暈，及顏面潮紅等症狀。惟是此等中毒，往往一家庭或一團體共同發生，不過發作有遲速，症狀有輕重耳，若僅發於一人者，頗為少見。在此類中毒，為人所易知者。</p>
<p>對於第二項的發生中毒者，其食物中每混合有特殊的物質，而故意的投置，即屬觸犯刑法，社會上時時可以聞見的。反之，由不經意而所起的中毒，以與食物的容器或烹調器有關係者爲最多，例如用銅鍋而將鑛物性的毒物進入於食物中，或容器內混有毒物，偶不留意而將食物盛入，此外如由鼠或蟑螂等的嚙食，而將中毒菌散布於食物的上而，亦時有之。會聞有某工廠，在夏日的朝晨，其職工全部的十分之七，均患吐瀉，並有頭痛，於是全廠騷然，頗疑及昨夜所食的食品中，恐含有毒質，因將廚房加以精細的檢査，一面將中毒較輕的職工詰問，方知咋夜有數職工，以鷄私携入工廠內烹煮，且加以牛蒡，而攪拌時並不用箸，即以在手旁的銅綫彎曲爲數條代之，經化騐結果，乃證明由銅鹽類的中毒。在此類的中毒，食者每不自知，由一方的故意或不留意而來者。</p>
<p>對於第三類的所謂特異質，其例較多，例如食某種食物後，有覺全身癢感者，或食某物即面紅耳赤若酒醉然，或則覺泛噁眩暈腹痛下瀉等，甚有因而猝倒者。而最奇者，有某運動家，軀體魁偉，殊爲壯健，但不能食蝦，縱食少許，即覺劇烈頭痛眩暈而猝倒，暫時後更發嘔吐下痢，約經半日言愈，但其後過敏度亦决第增進，甚至加入蝦共煮的湯汁，飲後亦發生同樣的中毒。此類的中毒，大都自已知曉，並可以防免的。而對於此中毒若僅認爲精神的，不如視爲其自己身體中的液質，對蝦的蛋白質，具有過敏的特殊反應之故。</p>
<p>上述食品中毒的原因，其第一第二兩項，必須速請醫師療治，吾則足以礙及生命，第三項則祗須自己隨時謹愼，即可避免之。</p>
<p>疾病常識</p>
<h3 id="c86">胃病（四） <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 莊畏仲</p>
<p>二爲嘔吐，胃潰瘍病人之三分之一，有此症狀，非盡人如此的。嘔吐每在痛時發作，倘食後立即吐出，則吐出的食物，當然沒有十分變化，但如經時稍久，則吐出物必爲酸性糜粥狀，此種吐物，最害牙齒。大概潰瘍生在胃入口噴門部的，食後即吐，如生於胃出口處即幽門部，則在食後隔兩三小時，方始嘔吐。</p>
<p>三爲胃出血，這因爲潰瘍的血管被蝕之故，被蝕血管有大有小，故出血有多有少，大量出血時，則見嘔血和瀉血，作者見到因大出血而失血死的也很多。倘出血的量很少，則外表看不出，只有用化學的方法，查糞中有無血液成分，所謂隱出血。嘔血，或沒有誘因可尋，突如其來，或以心身勞動或飽食爲誘因，普通在嘔血之前，常有劇烈胃痛。血液的一部分常移行至腸中，所以大便作黑色。</p>
<p>胃出血和肺出血的區別，是多數人急於要知道的，乘便寫一些：嘔血（胃出血）的血係隨嘔吐而排出，凝固時不含空氣，作暗紅色，反應酸性，其中混有飲食物之成分，突然發作，存續期短，自覺的先有嘔氣和上腹部壓感，體溫上升者少，糞便作黑色。咯血（肺出血）的血液，跟着咳嗽咯出，凝固時含有空氣，血色鮮紅，反應鹼性，混着黏液和膿，且存續期長，發作時先有胸內重感，絞感或溫液上升感，大抵發熱。　此外應注意的，如本爲肺出血或口鼻咽喉出血，一部分的血，嚥至胃內，重行吐出者，則易與胃出血混淆。</p>
<p>四為過酸症，即胃酸過多。</p>
<p>此外病人常訴呑酸嘈雜，口渴，食慾不定，有時反亢進，然如當發劇痛，則因恐食症而减其食量。</p>

<p>— （顧志斌）</p>
<p>七月二十一日的下午，在南京路的一角，某銀樓的門口，展開着熱閙的塲面。並且也是這銀樓開幕以來的創見，更然是自古以來銀樓界的新記錄。</p>
<p>在强烈的日光下，人行道上姑滿着人，都仲長着脖子，向店堂裏擁擠的人們呆望着，面上現着失望的樣子。少數的人，在用力地向裏擁擠着；剛擠進了門，却又被擁了出來，額上的汗珠，滾滾的掉到地上，氣喘喘地，嘴邊掛着駡人的聲調。但是亦有臉上得意洋洋從店中跨出來，似乎是已經得着勝利了。</p>
<p>人行道的左邊，站着一位身材矮小的老年人，嘴唇上留着長長的白鬚，搖動着頭，嘆了口氣，自言自語的說：「息了念頭吧！發財，沒有我老頭兒的份了。上午等到現在，飯也不會下肚，自四百多元的市價，一瀉而到三百五十元，賣金子的人，仍舊是那樣攢動着，並且越來越多，有力氣的話，四五十元的利益，不是已在手中了嗎？算了吧！發財，已經沒有老　兒的份了！」轉過了身子，提起了沉重的脚步，漸漸的離開了人羣。</p>
<p>市價的　換，激起了人聲嘈雜的聲浪。</p>
<p>在櫃台前的人羣中，有年靑的姑娘，年輕的小夥子，鄕村間的村婦，摩登的太太，西裝的少年，並且還有二位高鼻綠眼睛的異國婦人點綴着。在人聲稍靜一會兒的時候，忽然一個鄉下老太婆，發着顫動的聲調，手挿在衣袋裏，臉漲得紅而發紫，一刻兒由紫而轉白，山白而轉靑，二顆眼淚奪腔而出，原來藏在衣袋裏的一付金鐲，已不翼而飛了。</p>
<p>在店中的又一邊，一對年輕的夫婦在爭吵着。「關照你早上把那三隻綫戒都帶出來，祇肯帶一隻，上下半日的市價，相錯了六十元，不是意外損失了十二元嗎？嘿！不肯聽人話的束西！」男人眼睜睜大地對着那婦人。</p>
<p>「早上是你同我一同來的嗎？爲什麼你也不曾再提到道一點，到了這時候，還要怨三怨四，你也該負一些責任。說不定再等幾天，市價還要上漲呢？」那婦人也不肯示弱的回答着。男子聽了，臉上現出了一絲笑容，表示尙有一些希望存在着，二人擠出了店門。</p>
<p>人羣中，有專門打聽市價的，有的是做着小投機，市價漲了賣出，市價跌了買進，有的是在瞧熱閙，因此更加的擁擠了。</p>
<p>在這特殊的環境下，無形之中銀樓變成了小小的金子交易所了。</p>
<h3 id="c110">顧靑瑤女史畫扇 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>

<p>— 惠</p>
<p>「辨士聴明金磅糊塗，所有我們的鴨子都是鴻鵠。」</p>
<p>——英國·包頓——</p>
<p>跟近幾天的颶風高潮，同時湊成緊張局面的，便是金價的跳躍了。黃金的可愛，究竟自古而然。</p>
<p>但是上海的「鴨子」是不糊塗的，雖然他們也懂得金鎊的收藏：而金潮的掀起，正是鴨子們的好戲。因爲他們甘願一日數驚地騷擾於不平靜的潮水中</p>
<p>戰事一起，見過馬克世面的朋友，變得聰明起來了，偸偸地計算着保險箱裏的法幣，懷疑之餘便動了存入洋行的念頭。木過洋箱裏的家財，未必眞是「千秋萬世之業」也。</p>
<p>一疑再疑，又覺得洋票不如黃金，於是羣起而購之。市塲上連來幾個突破，金價便像浸在沸水裏的溫度計一樣地飛漲。</p>
<p>還記得一年之前，爲了强覇捷克，希特拉在歐洲試擺擂台，一時天下好漢，不乏摩拳擦掌者：共後張伯倫把摘自「荊棘叢中的鮮花」和「食盤裏的鴿子」進貢給慕尼黑台主之後，歐洲暫時「天下太平」了。但是當世界大戰的恐怖，壓得人心緊縮時，浮沉金潮中的鴨子，也曾經騷動得分外厲害，聰明的辨士，糊塗的金鎊，一時紛紛漲落，他們也就彷徨終日。</p>
<p>一年過去了，但澤的好戲又在排演，獨裁者的陰謀是一套層出不窮的魔術，那些玩火者終究會燃着炸彈。那時候上海的金迷，要如何惶惑呢？只有戰神知道。現在他們的爭鬧，已呌交易所成了十足的鴨棚。</p>
<p>爲什麼鴨子們不到「內河」裏去呢？賢明的主人會保護啊。孤島上驚濤駭浪的生活，到底頭痛的</p>
<p>自然，除非在祖國的土地上，我們不會得到自由的保障的，留在上海的資產者，搖身一變爲內地的民族資本家時，「所有我們的鴨子都是鴻鵠」了。</p>
<h3 id="c112">女彈詞人物誌 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>說到女彈詞義賣</p>
<p>「冶遊錄」：「洋塲向有書庽，固滬北佳麗薈萃之區也。…其中著名者，的五十人。有好事者，作洋塲書庽序，將彼姝名字，悉嵌於中，幾令人一覽而知，無遺珠之嘆……」頗足說明「書腐序」所包含當時主要女彈詞姓氏之完備。而合前數總錄以考，則此中簸爲人矚目之女彈詞，常爲李佩蘭。畹香留夢窒主「淞南夢影錄」卷一，有李佩蘭傳，文云：</p>
<p>媚香樓主人李佩蘭，瓊姿玉質，恬靜寡言。性雅潔，座上無雜賓。入其室者，覺茗椀爐香，位置妥貼，窗明几淨，纖塵不染·客苟當意，則終日作娓娓談，略無倦意·而允喜賙人之急，雖撒手千金，略無吝色。余淡心所稱紅妝季布，殆在此而不在彼乎？</p>
<p>其爲人有極可稱者。梅花香裏聽琴客亦有詩贈之云：「水晶爲骨玉爲腸，洗盡風流時世妝。不獨靈心兼妙腕，烏絲闌寫十三行。」備加稱讀。此處所云「烏絲闌寫十三行」，想係指佩蘭另一可稱之事。蓋其時豫中吿饑，某紳士繪「鐵淚圖」募人捐賑，佩蘭閱之惻然，立輸番銀三百元，並匄雲間薈紅巢主代撰小啟，勸姊妹行協助·其啟情文交至，哀艶動人，「夢影錄」與黃協塤鋤經書舍零墨」（一八七八）卷二會並載之：</p>
<p>……茲當晋困未舒，豫災又吿，大府重恤鄰之誼，善人籌移粟之方。試披鐵淚新圖，無異監鬥往事。地少有根之草，野無完體之屍，數萬戶鬻女烹男，鬼神亦泣；幾千里靑燐白骨，天地爲悲。而兒等艶唱方濃，綺筵乍展，薄珍　而不御，厭綠綺以無華·燈火連宵，歡寗有極，笙歌比戶，樂且無涯。凡人間作孽之錢，博兒輩傾城之笑，業已隨風作絮，命薄今生，何堪如土揮金，福消來世？用是發大覺悟，結小因緣，倡捐三百之金資，更贈一言於姊妹。伏願各行方便，大發慈悲。試當熱鬧之塲，設想凄凉之景。救得多人性命，勝似燒香；積成一念陰功，何須宣卷？所望聚沙爲塔，集腋成裘，或施壓鬢之釵，或擲纏頭之錦，略减繁華於北里，俾延喘息於中州，下及花面丫頭，知心侍婢，曲中鴇婦，塲外龜奴，苟生片念之慈心，即可解囊以忺助。佛法原歸於平等，義舉要藉夫衆成。仗此善因，各培後果。庶幾福田廣種，拯彼無吿之窮民，行看苦海同離，共證有情之眷屬。</p>
<p>據「零墨」所載，此「鐵淚圖」係吳中紳士所繪，凡十二幅，當時遍掛通衢·其實不僅光緒初之書庽，即來年之妓女，對於賑災諸義舉，亦時有襄助。名妓李蘋香，即會以繪畫賑災黎。今當苦戰時期，中國陷於史大災難之中，義賣之聲，徹諸通國。彈詞界義不後人，時有濟難播唱，顧女彈詞雖復趨繁榮，且有「普餘社」之集合組織，然於此類義舉，尙屬無聞，未免遺憾。甚盼普餘社能及時興起，使數十年前之義舉，能重見於今日，而更發揚光大之也。</p>
<h3 id="c113">岐途女人 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Girls　On　Probation”</p>
<p>華納公司出品　大光明戲院映</p>
<p>我們有一個故事：一個强盜臨刑的時候，向他的母親索奶，而將母親的乳頭咬了下來。他說：「你從小溺愛我，不管敎我，以致現在落得做强盜，處死刑。這傷痕留給你一個敎訓！」</p>
<p>不問這故事的眞實與否，或者前人的說敎，但於此可見家庭敎育的重要。</p>
<p>「岐途女人」的劇作者，就採取了兩個在絕對不同的家庭敎育下生長的女性，而獲得不同的因果作爲題材。可惜他太遷就故事，不能深入地把康妮和希迪的不同環境作强烈的對比。譬如康妮父親的的束她的女兒，把他寫成一個滑稽的頑固守舊者，而不是一個具有遠大目光的家長。希迪的浪漫成性，也祇從康妮父親的一句話中補叙出來。其後希迪偕男友湯尼搶刦銀行，也沒有加强她墮落的過程。如果能够從這方面着力，這個戲將更使人感動，而演出效果也將更有力量。</p>
<p>導演者似乎也沒有抓到造個戲的重心，整個戲始終是平穩地發展着，比較着重的反在希迪墮落以後，而把高潮放在警探追捕湯尼，落了一般偵探片的老調。不過在描寫康妮和希迪兩個人的性格，是刻劃得非常明顯的。</p>
<p>琪恩白拉恩的康妮，在被捕後堅不吐實的那塲戲中，演得相常動人。希拉勃洛萊的希迪，牠的反角演得也好，譬如竊取店中衣服時的滿不在乎；在獄中的頑强潑辣；逼康妮　當鑽戒時那種下流的恣態，都顯示她是個有希望的演員。</p>

<p>九江敎友欲在附近某縣建立敎堂，先派少年敎友二人，赴縣署求見邑尊，欲請頒發吿示保護，邑遵答以公務冗忙，不及接見。此二少年以爲推諉，願等候衙署門外以待邑尊公畢晤見。於是該處居民，圍觀者漸多，聲勢洶湧。邑尊恐生事，因命會見於大堂上，不料此二人必欲延入內廳，以便陳說，邑侯不得已延之而入。談論之間，衆人已擠入衙內。邑侯對此二少年之請求，以縣城缺少兵弁，實難保護爲辭。當二少年退出時，見聚集之衆，層疊擁圍，大有發難之意，懼而復入。請求邑尊保護，邑尊無奈，只得親自伴送，於是邑尊前行，二少年緊跟於後，差役則左右簇擁，送出人叢之外。邑尊謂此地已不害矣，遂即辭回。乃邑尊甫行轉身，而大衆齊聲吶喊，一擁上前。蓋最初衆人因見邑尊在前，未敢囉唣，忍氣呑聲，看其出走，今邑尊旣去，遂怒氣齊起，不復可遏矣。差役見之，豈肯尚爲蔽翼，早已影跡全無矣。衆圍旣合，各擲石飛擊，如雨如蝗。少年見不是路，三十六着走爲上着，狠命飛奔。衆復大聲喊呌，在後追逐，二少年一氣奔出城門，其時天已將黑，追又將至，危險萬分。至城濠浜上，欲渡無梁，已成絕路，二少年遂奮身躍入濠河，鳧河渡至彼岸。追逐之人，見其鳧水，遂亦復鳧水來逐，因泅術較遜，少年始得脫險。於是黑夜奔回九江，心之驚嚇，狀之張皇，已不堪回首矣。翌日，禀知美領事，現已移文華官，要令該縣賠補銀款云。</p>

<p>劇界的同志，團結禦侮的力量，比任何團體來得堅强。往往因爲一件小事，登高一呼，全體響應！這種熱情與勇氣，很足以抵抗外來惡勢力的汚辱，是很値得贊美的！我常願此種精神，保持勿失！甚且推而廣之，允其是處在這「劃時代」的期間。</p>
<p>可是話又說回來了，劇界的同志，勇於私鬭的，亦大不乏人，在演武戲的同志中，更什九具有此種特性。我還記得在赴美的途中，同人抵掌閒譚，以破岑寂，徐君蘭沅曾說過一個「荒郊爭雄」的故事，眞覺滑稽突梯，譎誕不測！其事之幽默雋永，如讀林語堂之論語，讀者如不信，請　吾「游美日記」中所記徐君之言：</p>
<p>啊我們戲班兒裏有一句話，呌做「一聲兒不響才是眞好漢」，這句話的來源，雖然是指當時吃寳局子的混混兒而言，（斐按：寳局子即賭塲，混混兒即流氓。）但是因爲大大王二大王的一塲惡鬭，更加强了這句話的「定律」。</p>
<p>大大王是許德義，二大王是朱湘泉，道兩個人都是打武戲的好手。兩人雖然同隸一班，可是彼此意見參商，情同冰炭，時常發生口角，繼之以動武，在後台，彼此是從來不交一言的。</p>
<p>有一天，我們後台的全班演員，忽發現一件詫異稀奇而令人百思不得其解的事實。就是：許朱二人，忽然親熱起來！戲完之後，總是相的一同外出。有的時候許的戲先完，則必很安詳的坐在戲箱上等候湘泉。等他唱完，然後一同外出。若湘泉的戲先完，則亦必照樣的等候德義。他們倆從來不曾如此親熱要好過，今突然改變常態，呌我們後台同人，如何能不驚詫呢？大家深滋疑竇，也不曉得他倆幹的是什麽勾當？同到什麽地方去？如此竟達一月之久！</p>
<p>後來，經過了派人偵查，才發現了他倆的秘密。眞是有意味！</p>

<p>編者介紹：陳燕燕舊稱「美麗的小鳥」，立名銀搜，迄近十年；關於藝事如何，固已早有定評，可母贅言，茲所欲爲申述者，即本文詳述從影往事，非僅至情至意，大足感人，而敬業樂羣之足證成名如此，有其重大因由，是　値得同爲歡喜讚嘆不置者矣。</p>
<p>光陰似飛箭一般過得眞快！我從投身銀幕以來，不覺往事如夢，已歷九年。到現在於業務方面雖幸薄負虛名，差堪自慰；但在心頭上終天抱恨的一腔隱痛；總是一件沒法消除的絕大憾事。</p>
<p>這就是我影史的起端，因爲實在太傷心了，不忍出口，九年來只是深深地鐫在自己心版之上，就從沒有對人說起過。所以有些影刊上的記載，只是不盡然的浮面之事，並非由我親口說出的眞情。我眞太痛心了，委實沒有訴述這番罪言的勇氣。</p>
<p>這是否是値得吿訴大家的事？——在許多愛護我的銀幕觀衆之前。想到這番舊情，心上是悲痛極了，這話又該先從那裹說起呢？</p>
<p>…童年時期家庭情况淪陷下之故都，就是我世居的老家。家庭情形很簡單，一家大小三口，相依爲命，就只嚴父，慈母和我這獨生女見。父親很古板很守舊，他是一位道學先生。童年時期，我早在名呌「聖心」的一所敎會學堂裏讀書。十歲那年，父親以爲女孩子大了，不該再似往時那樣跑出門去；因此就請一位老先生在家設塾，朝朝暮暮，長年敎讀。這樣直經七年，諸如論語，孟子，古文觀止之類是依决讀完了。在十五六歲時，除了勤於臨摹大小字帖外，自已又很喜觀習畫，照本臨　的工筆花卉畫得眞不少，且又極感語趣；但只無師傳授，儘在妄自塗抹而已；這些幼稚作品，想起來是很可笑而不成什麽東西的。</p>

<p>因言菊朋的紅想起貫大元的潦倒</p>
<p>但是他却合了「紅鸞禧」金松所說的那句詞「你可吃定了我了，」二十錄年來，簡直就帮準了他的外甥貫大元，始終沒有脫離過一天，不但不稍求進步，並且越拉越糟，因此就把大元限制的不敢隨便改換一字一腔，因爲偶爾變了舊章之後，他這位琴師舅舅就得在臺上抓瞎，試想唱皮黃戲要弄到像刻版文章似的，那豈不顯着太呆板了麽？大元吃了他這般大的虧，依舊不敢把他辭退，另換他人；所以他無論在平·津等地出演，他的胡琴可從來不曾得過一决好。這和馬運良之與楊賣忠，王少樓之與陳鴻壽，琴師同角兒搶着要彩的情形可大不相同了。據一般爲大元前途設想的人談起，倘使大元要想在臺上得到較多的彩聲，非得先把陳某解決，另請一位高明的琴師不可，他是吾有此勇氣，那就非局外人所得而知了。</p>
<p>大元會的戲的在百齣左右，家裏收藏的老本子也非常之多，恐怕那都是賈麗川叔侄留下來的。譚派戲並不僅僅是「捉放」「空城」「駡曹」」「碰碑」「洪羊洞」「鳥盆計」這幾齣而已，紥靠，穿蟒，拿刀，動槍，甩弔毛，翻筋斗，等等的戲，也還很有幾十齣。爲什麼現放着一位年紀猶未衰老，而且文武兼全的貫大元不邀他離平南下，俾其　展所長，一任其潦倒抑鬱，淹沒所學，這實在是件很不公平的事呢。（六六）</p>

<h3 id="e1">British and Japanese Authorities Released Negotiation Results Last Night Chamberlain Still Claims China Policy Has Not Changed No Problem with Aid to Legal Tender and Tianjin Deposited Silver <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today's House of Commons meeting, the whole venue was in an atmosphere of eager anticipation, quietly listening to Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on the Anglo-Japanese agreement. The Prime Minister said that before the start of negotiations between the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on resolving the Tianjin incident, preliminary talks had been held in Tokyo from July 15th. The Japanese government stated at the beginning of the discussion that if progress could be made in eliminating misunderstandings between the two sides and establishing better relations between the two countries, it would be necessary to acknowledge the review of the background to the Tianjin situation. This matter has nothing to do with the British government's China policy, but is merely a matter of fact. As the war is currently being conducted on a large scale in China, the Japanese army must seek its own security and maintain public order in the areas it occupies, so it has to take action to prevent this force from being hindered. In order to clear the way for discussing the Tianjin incident, the British government has reached the following agreement with the Japanese government: "The British government fully recognizes the reality of the large-scale war currently underway in China, and recognizes that when this situation continues for a long time, the Japanese army in China has special needs to ensure its own safety and maintain public order in the areas under its control, and should prevent or eliminate any actions or events that hinder the Japanese army or benefit the enemy. The British government has no intention of assisting any actions that may hinder the Japanese army from achieving the above-mentioned goals, and will take this opportunity to clearly inform British officials and expatriates in China that they should not engage in such behavior or plans, in order to demonstrate the British policy on this matter," he said.</p>
<p>After the Prime Minister finished reading the plan, Communist MP Gallacher shouted, "Shameful." The Prime Minister then replied to a question from Labour MP Fletcher, stating that Britain had not agreed to anything in the guarantee negotiations that would harm Chinese legal tender or the right of British loans to the Chinese government for any purpose, and emphasized that the negotiations were limited to the Tianjin local dispute. He also replied to a question from Labour MP Henderson, stating that the concessions made by Britain did not, in effect, recognize the sovereignty of the Japanese armed forces over the occupied parts of China. He also replied to a question from Labour MP Benn, stating that he did not want to clearly state which land was under Japanese control. Benn had asked, "Is the British government not agreeing to a policy direction to be carried out in this area? What is this area?" The Prime Minister replied, "The area controlled by the Japanese." Labour MP Shinwell then asked whether this statement did not contain the meaning that the British government was now colluding with Japan. Conservative MPs all shouted, "No." Conservative MP Churchill asked whether this answer did not contain the meaning that the British government was maintaining strict neutrality. Labour MP Greenwood wanted to know whether there had been any changes to Britain's China policy. The Prime Minister replied, "No, the declaration does not contain any meaning of the British government making any changes to the Chinese government," he said. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>Labour MP Strauss then requested the Prime Minister to provide assurances that the silver in Tianjin, worth £2.5 million, would not be handed over to Japan. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied on behalf of the Prime Minister, "The Japanese government has never made any proposal on how to dispose of this silver." Labour MP Belcher also asked, "Is this silver deposited in a British bank, and as the situation in Tianjin is unstable, should it be moved to a safe place?" Under-Secretary Butler replied, "Please submit this question in writing." Labour MP questioned again, "Does Under-Secretary Butler mean that the Chinese government wants our country to hand over this silver to Japan?" Under-Secretary Butler replied no. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 10 p.m. that Foreign Minister Arita and the British Ambassador to Japan had held successive talks since July 15th, and the results are announced as follows: The British government fully recognizes the reality of the large-scale combat operations underway in China, and recognizes that during the continuation of this state, the Japanese army stationed in China can put forward special requests in order to ensure its own safety and maintain the security of the areas under its control, and that it is necessary to eliminate all actions and causes that are harmful to the Japanese army and beneficial to its enemy. The British government should make it clear to its officials and nationals in China that it has no intention of taking any actions or measures that may hinder the Japanese army in achieving the above-mentioned goals, and should control such actions when such actions are taken, in order to confirm the policy.

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax made the same remarks in the House of Lords today as Prime Minister Chamberlain made in the House of Commons today. The Foreign Secretary also stated that both Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie were aware during the talks leading to the Anglo-Japanese compromise that: (1) The Japanese government does not harbor the intention of preventing the British government from raising any cases that may occur in the future; (2) The British government has expressed the opinion that nothing in the plan affects the obligations of other powers; (3) Sir Robert Craigie had informed the Japanese government that it was imperative not to encourage newspapers to engage in mutual accusations and extravagant demands, which would only hinder the outcome of negotiations on local disputes that were about to begin; (4) Sir Robert Craigie had made strong representations regarding the anti-British movement. The Foreign Secretary continued that this riot would largely come to an end as a result of the compromise that had now been agreed upon. At the same time, it was also heard that Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma had declared that the Japanese government had determined its policy and could control riots that did not conform to this policy. Former Foreign Secretary Lord Cecil then rose to speak, asking to pay attention to a certain statement made by Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, and it was heard that the British government, in view of this statement, was prepared to declare that it did not advocate reversing its usual policy towards General Chiang Kai-shek. The Foreign Secretary replied that he did not wish to make detailed comments on Hiranuma's statement before receiving an official report, but recalled that Prime Minister Chamberlain had clearly stated in the House of Commons last week that Britain could not change its policy at the direction of any other country, and that the British government would certainly maintain this position without hesitation. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When a spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters today, he was asked whether the actions that threatened Britons in China would end now that the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference on the Tianjin issue was being held. The spokesperson replied that the Japanese had no connection with the anti-British movement currently underway in China. (Reuter, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e4">New Appeasement Movement <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The changes in the international situation are truly similar to the sunny and rainy weather of these days. Since the Munich Agreement, the offensive of the aggressors has become increasingly arrogant and despotic, the map of Europe has changed again and again, small and weak countries are in danger, and the credibility of Britain has plummeted. Chamberlain resolutely ignored the ridicule at home and abroad, but very hesitantly wavered between the anti-aggression front and the appeasement policy.</p>
<p>The new "appeasement" movement is brewing not only in compromising with Japan, but also in Europe. It is said that a "peace" plan related to Danzig is being drafted to "calm" Hitler, while German economic expert Walter is in talks with London. As for the Far East, the negotiations between Craigie and Arita in Tokyo have already established preliminary concessions to "improve" the relationship between London and Tokyo. Europe and the Far East are one body; apart from China's resistance, which is a unique glory, everything else is stealthy and ambiguous. A certain newspaper in Paris said, "Britain's position in Europe will be strengthened due to the Anglo-Japanese compromise," which is completely the self-consolation of a pitiful worm, a self-mockery. Frankly speaking, today the eastern and western aggressors have completed close contact, and the compromise in the East has not only encouraged the advance of the eastern aggressors, but also induced the arrogance of the West. To go back further, what was the result of the Munich humiliation? It was Japan's seizure of Hainan Island, intensifying the threat to the interests of Britain and France; to go back closer, what was the result of Japan's blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin? It was Hitler's intensification of his coveting of Danzig, and the rise of the anti-British movement in Germany and Italy. And the compromise in Tokyo will inevitably have its consequences.</p>
<p>The Munich Agreement was the result of Chamberlain's appeasement policy. It left a painful lesson for the world, and it planted a greater and deeper root of disaster in the international community. Therefore, the "new appeasement movement" that once again compromises with the aggressors, in addition to expanding and deepening the international crisis, Britain making further concessions, is war. According to the Associated Press, French political circles have reacted with disgust to Chamberlain's attempt at a "new appeasement movement," and they believe that this attempt is completely detrimental to France, "First, as a result of this new appeasement policy, France's allies will inevitably abandon it one after another; second, after Germany obtains the actual benefits of the new appeasement policy, it will be insatiable and will continue to demand concessions; third, if the new appeasement policy is implemented, Italy's demands for French colonies will be revived." Yes, the result of France's following Chamberlain in Munich greatly weakened its own position, and if France wants to safeguard its own interests and security, it must resolutely oppose that "new appeasement policy."</p>
<p>Chamberlain's "new appeasement movement" has unfavorable effects on the Far East, but it will never create a "Munich of the East" situation as the aggressors hope. Because although Chamberlain wants to repeat the tragedy of Munich, China's firm self-reliance in resistance will inevitably make Chamberlain unable to direct the tragedy. Although China welcomes any assistance from foreign forces, it does not rely on the assistance of foreign forces. Therefore, even without foreign assistance, it will inevitably continue to resist. Moreover, it is by no means the entire international community that is following Britain's retreat.</p>
<h3 id="e5">President Chiang's Opinion on Anglo-Japanese Negotiations The Aim of the War of Resistance is to Complete the Revolution and is Not Affected by the External Environment The Government is Determined to Maintain Legal Tender and Consolidate the Financial Foundation <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) President Chiang expressed his opinion at the joint memorial week of the Central National Government on the 24th, roughly saying that no matter how difficult the environment is, there must be a way to resist the war, and the more difficult the environment, the more practical the way to resist the war, the greater the strength, and the faster the period of final victory. The current war situation is indeed more consolidated than before, and it is allowed that in the military aspect, the battle reports from various war zones have been completely stabilized, and are absolutely different from the situation before the retreat from Hankou. The internal spirit is even more united and absolutely consistent. No matter what difficulties, they can be broken through, and the more difficult it is, the more it can encourage struggle. All countries that have been revolutionized and revived in the world are like this. Haven't the Soviet Union and Turkey experienced difficulties and been subjected to long-term and strict blockades in the process of revolution? It was once said that today's difficulties are not considered difficulties, and there will be ten times or a hundred times more difficulties than today in the future, but we will definitely be able to struggle strongly in extreme difficulties and dangers to achieve victory. This war of resistance is a struggle to complete the revolution, and the revolution is absolutely not affected by changes in the external environment. Now all countries in the world, the vast majority of the people, are supporting justice and reason, and sympathizing with our war of resistance. We will absolutely not be isolated, and as far as the past is concerned, our revolution originally had no material basis. Chiang also mentioned the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, believing that in fact there would never be a Far East Munich. Because friendly countries are countries that value credibility and understand the overall situation, they can never abandon their own obligations and legal stance, nor will they ignore their own interests. Therefore, it is inappropriate to use Munich as a comparison. It must be known that China is the Republic of China created by revolutionary struggle and self-reliance, which is completely different from the situation of Czechoslovakia's founding due to the results of the European War. After more than two years of war resistance, the walls are particularly clear, and the war resistance mentality of the national military and civilians is particularly strong. The Chinese nation will never succumb to any difficult environment and abandon its sacred duty of self-hygiene and survival. As far as ourselves are concerned, the government has always believed in the motto of "Heaven helps those who help themselves." No matter in military affairs, diplomacy, or economy, it has been decided from the beginning to support itself, struggle independently to the end, and naturally hope that there will be more and more friendly countries to assist. Without assistance, it is even more necessary to persevere in the struggle to the end. After the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo negotiations, our strength in resisting the war can not only be strengthened, but also be more lasting. It is permissible to forget one characteristic, that China is a revolutionary country, and no matter what hardships it encounters, it must have the determination to struggle independently, and never have a mentality of reliance and wait-and-see. Chiang then discussed the economy and finance, saying that the foreign exchange rate was manipulated by speculators in the Shanghai black market, and there was a temporary shaking phenomenon a few days ago, but the government will definitely always maintain the price of legal tender, supply legal foreign exchange, and implement appropriate controls. The government has a definite grasp to consolidate the financial foundation. Regarding the control of foreign exchange, the government has studied a more complete and appropriate overall method to seek fundamental stability. It must be known that the financial and financial foundation of the war of resistance is in the inland. The financial economy in the inland has been established in the past year, so it can now be responsible for declaring that the government is determined to maintain the value of legal tender with all its strength, and will definitely be able to maintain the exchange rate between legal tender and foreign exchange as much as possible. This is no problem. There are more than sufficient preparations for the use of legal tender in the occupied areas, and it will be maintained with all our hearts to ensure that our people's livelihood is not affected in the slightest, and that our compatriots do not suffer any loss. Now that a new policy is being implemented, the economic foundation will be more consolidated in the future, and there will be great progress in the national economy and the people's livelihood. It must be known that this change in the foreign exchange rate is absolutely beneficial to the war economy, and will absolutely not have any unfavorable effects on the war of resistance, because all military equipment and military supplies have been fully prepared, and now there is no need to use a single cent of the foreign exchange fund to replenish military equipment. Moreover, all provinces have had bumper harvests this year, which not only increases exports, but also provides a richer supply of daily necessities. At the same time, due to the change in the foreign exchange rate, it can reduce unnecessary imports, curb huge leaks, and create natural savings. In short, the war of resistance originally relied on self-reliance in economy and independent combat in military affairs as the basis. If we can strengthen ourselves and help ourselves, we will be able to get the help of friendly countries in the world. (24th Electricity)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Well-informed sources here declared last night that, regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, as a result of Britain's expression of compromise to Japan, the Chinese government will seriously consider the memorandum of compromise jointly issued by Britain and Japan before expressing its attitude again. Although Chinese people are disappointed with the news of Britain's concession to Japan, they are not surprised. At the beginning of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, Britain had already accepted the conditions proposed by Japan that were unfavorable to China. Political observers believe that this has indicated Britain's intention to compromise. Chinese officials here stated that although Britain has changed its attitude, China's policy of resisting the war will not change, and it will still adhere to its initial determination to resist the war to the end. It is said that Britain's change of attitude will affect China's combat effectiveness in material terms. It must be known that China's current resistance is not entirely based on foreign aid. The reason why the war of resistance has been able to last until today is entirely due to the manpower of our country. The spokesperson continued that China now has at least enough arms to support it for another year and a half. (Haitong, 24th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese Tokyo talks entered the second stage on the 24th, and began to discuss specific issues regarding the Tianjin case. At 8:40 this morning, British Ambassador Craigie first went to the Foreign Minister's residence to discuss future matters with Foreign Minister Arita, and then left at 8:50. Then, at 9:00 a.m., the British and Japanese representatives all arrived at the residence of the Foreign Affairs Officer, and at 9:20, the meeting was held in the form of a roundtable conference. The Japanese attendees included Minister Kato, Consul Tanaka, Major General Shikito, Colonel Kawamura, and other related administrative officials (Domei, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British attendees were Craigie, Military Attaché Picot, Tianjin Consul Herbert, Commercial Secretary Maclay, Second Secretary Goebbels, and Third Secretary Bland, Third Secretary Allen of the British Embassy in China (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The first Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference opened at 9:20 this morning. Foreign Minister Arita and Ambassador Craigie first introduced the representatives from their respective countries. Then, Foreign Minister Arita put forward the Japanese conditions regarding the specific issues of the Tianjin case, and requested that discussions be conducted according to the Japanese conditions. The British side agreed to this, and then Minister Kato explained the various conditions in detail. The British and Japanese representatives gradually conducted the meeting, and temporarily announced a break at 11:25.</p>
<p>The Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at 12:15 p.m. on the 24th that in order to discuss various issues related to the Tianjin incident, representatives from Britain and Japan held the first meeting at the residence of the Foreign Affairs Officer at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th. Minister Kato first gave a comprehensive explanation of the Japanese viewpoint, and British Ambassador Craigie only gave a simple reply to this, without going into details. Then, the Japanese side added explanations, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 4:00 p.m. today, and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>In the previous Arita-Craigie meetings, because no one else participated, they were all conducted in English. However, in today's first roundtable conference on the Tianjin issue, the Japanese side spoke entirely in Japanese. First, Minister Kato spoke in Japanese, and then Administrative Officer Asami translated it into English. On the British side, Ambassador Craigie spoke in English, and Secretary Brahm translated it into Japanese. During the subsequent meetings, the Japanese side continued to use Japanese. (Domei, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Tianjin incident, after the opening of the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference today, the British and Japanese representatives conducted general discussions on the issue of maintaining the safety and public order of Tianjin. Then, a committee was organized with two representatives from each of Britain and Japan to clarify some of the details raised during the conference. The next full roundtable conference will be held when the committee has completed its report. The committee is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita will invite the British and Japanese representatives to lunch tomorrow. After the continued meeting this afternoon, the Information Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following communiqué: The second Anglo-Japanese talks were held from 4:00 p.m. to 6:10 p.m., focusing on general discussions on the issue of maintaining the safety and public order of Tianjin. Some points need to be clarified in detail, which will be discussed by a committee organized by British representatives Picot and Herbert, and Japanese representatives Tanaka and Ota. The committee is scheduled to meet at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, and a full roundtable conference will be convened after the report is completed. It is heard that the two meetings this morning and afternoon have proceeded smoothly, and the two sides exchanged opinions on the issues of maintaining Tianjin's security and order and police administration in a free and frank manner, without any fierce disputes. Some newspapers predict that these talks can be peacefully concluded within this month (Reuter, 11-14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese on-site negotiations on the 24th continued from 4 p.m., discussing the security and police issues that are considered the most difficult to resolve in the on-site issues. Based on the general understanding established between Arita and Craigie the other day, the Japanese side requested the British side to cooperate in eliminating various anti-Japanese activities in the concession, and stated the Japanese claims regarding (1) strictly suppressing anti-Japanese movements in the British Concession, (2) jointly investigating anti-Japanese criminals in the British Concession, and (3) removing anti-Japanese Chinese employees of the Concession Public Bureau. Although the British side understood the spirit of the Japanese claims, it expressed opinions on strictly suppressing anti-Japanese movements and jointly investigating anti-Japanese criminals, hoping to cooperate with the Japanese side within the scope of not harming the autonomous security maintenance rights of the concession. There is still some distance between the opinions of the British and Japanese sides on this, so in order to obtain a consensus between the two sides on specific issues, it was decided that a small committee would be organized by Japanese Consul Tanaka, Major Ota, British Consul Harbutt, and Major General Picot for evaluation. The meeting adjourned at 6:20 p.m. In general, the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference will be held again on the 26th. (Domei, 24th)</p>

<p>(Washington) State Department officials stated last night that Tokyo's arbitrary misinterpretation of the Arita-Craigie Agreement will make it more difficult to maintain the balance of power in the Far East in the future. However, regarding the point that Britain has recognized the state of war within China and will no longer aid China, the State Department has not yet obtained confirmation. However, if the Japanese side interprets the Anglo-Japanese agreement as a victory for the Japanese side, it will inevitably make a big mistake. Well-informed sources said that this agreement is by no means a victory for Japan, because Britain has only accepted the position that the United States has already recognized, but under this position, the freedom of the Japanese side is also greatly restricted.

<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph recently carried a report saying that both Britain and Japan have expressed concessions, but the extent of the concessions that the Japanese side has reported and the claim that Japan has been successful are all exaggerated.

<h3 id="e9">British Newspaper Discusses the Tokyo Talks <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Times published an editorial today expressing its opinion on the memorandum signed by British Ambassador Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, saying that the Tokyo plan clears the way and a dangerous dispute can be ended, placing British neutrality on a foundation that is the same as the neutrality implemented by the United States and other countries. The promise given by Britain can only be criticized by those who are prepared to resist or obstruct the Japanese army. This move by Britain cannot be regarded as abandoning China or harming the interests of any foreigners in China. According to the opinion of neutral diplomats, the British government has achieved a more moderate solution than was initially possible, which can be congratulated. The rhetoric of the Axis powers during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations has indicated that the success of the negotiations will greatly disappoint Germany and Italy. Today, the Kokumin Shimbun, the organ of the Japanese military, has issued a warning that Britain will engage in alienation between Japan and the Axis powers. The reason why the Japanese government is comparatively accommodating in resolving the matter is due to various factors, and the domestic situation is one of them. The domestic extremists are currently using the anti-British movement to cover up the resurgence of their activities. The majority of the Japanese ruling class is frightened by this dangerous undertow, and is quietly supporting the resolution behind the scenes. At the same time, the Japanese government also understands that if it misses the current opportunity, Anglo-Japanese relations will become enemies and cannot be salvaged. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing, Chinese Planes Fight Back Vigorously, Over One Hundred Bombs Dropped Before Retreating <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) On the 14th, Japanese planes attacked Chongqing at dusk, as the new moon rose. Fierce fighting broke out with the Chinese Air Force. The Japanese planes, heavily struck by the Chinese planes, were in disarray and quickly retreated, unable to sustain the battle. Today, the Chinese Air Defense Command reported that the Japanese planes were divided into two groups: the first group with eighteen planes and the second group with nine planes, totaling seventeen planes, flying west to attack Chongqing. After receiving the report, the Chinese Air Force was ready and waiting. Soon, the Japanese planes entered Chongqing airspace in two groups. The Chinese ground searchlights immediately focused and searched for the Japanese planes. Upon finding the Japanese planes, the Chinese Air Force bravely fought back. Under the heavy fire of the Chinese forces, the Japanese planes dared not linger and hastily dropped over a hundred incendiary and explosive bombs in several suburban areas before attempting to escape. The Chinese Air Force continued to pursue and fire fiercely. According to eyewitnesses, one Japanese plane was seen emitting white smoke and plummeting from the sky. After driving the Japanese planes out of the country, the Chinese Air Force reorganized and returned to base. According to a subsequent investigation, a fire broke out at one location in the suburbs where bombs landed, destroying dozens of houses. There were some civilian casualties, but the number is unknown. (24th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) A serious anti-British riot and demonstration occurred in Tanggu last night. The British destroyer HMS Thracian (1,045 tons) arrived there this morning and is docked at the Asiatic Petroleum Company wharf. The British Consul-General in Tianjin and the British military authorities have separately lodged protests with Japanese personnel and military authorities. The sequence of events is as follows: Last night, about two hundred rioters began rioting, first attacking the Kailuan Mining Bureau buildings, throwing bricks and stones, and smashing doors and windows. They then went to the residence of the manager of the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil station, destroying its doors and windows, cutting the telephone lines, and throwing bricks and stones at the company's huge oil tanks, but without causing damage. They then rushed to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., smashing many doors and windows. Finally, they rushed to Butterfield &amp; Swire, but there was no violence. According to Chinese rumors today, a larger anti-British riot will soon be held in Dagu. Today, a reporter from a certain newspaper asked a Japanese military spokesperson, given the frequent anti-British demonstrations occurring in various parts of China, whether the Japanese army had the ability to maintain peace and order. The spokesperson replied that this anti-British movement was spontaneous, originating from the people themselves. The Japanese army currently has the ability to maintain peace and order, so while sympathizing with the anti-British movement, it will still suppress any attempt to disrupt peace and order, because rioting is illegal. The spokesperson admitted that when the riot occurred in Tanggu yesterday, the Chinese and Japanese police forces there were perhaps insufficient. However, he could not provide a concrete answer to the question of why the authorities, who were nearby when the riot occurred yesterday, did not suppress it. The reporter further asked how long it would take to disperse an anti-Japanese demonstration if one occurred. The spokesperson smiled and replied, "The Japanese have been working to change the feelings of the Chinese people since 1931." Reporters also inquired about the restrictions placed on the Tianjin Concession and whether there was any possibility of relaxing them. The spokesperson replied that there would be no change in these restrictions while the Tokyo talks were in progress. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Weihaiwei) The anti-British movement has now spread to Weihaiwei. Anti-British leaflets are being distributed everywhere, and the Chinese-language Xinminbao, sponsored by the Japanese, is also publishing vehement articles attacking Britain. An organization calling itself the Chinese Patriotic Anti-British Association is the body behind this movement. The Xinminbao stated that any Chinese still working for the British should be sentenced to death, and that all British people must be expelled from Weihaiwei, with Chinese people monitoring their departure and not allowing them to return to China. The text frequently used phrases such as "ferocious British," "hateful British," "unwelcome British," and "shameless British." (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Although the Japanese authorities here are said to have prohibited anti-British demonstrations and parades, anti-British propaganda in Chinese newspapers is intensifying daily, branding Britain as the representative of white imperialism and the common enemy of the yellow race in Asia. One newspaper carried an editorial stating that as Japan becomes increasingly strong, Britain will lose all its interests in China. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Xianghe steamer was stopped and boarded for inspection by armed Japanese personnel on Saturday night downstream of the British Concession, a process that lasted for over two hours. As a result, two gold bars and several silver bars were confiscated, and three Chinese crew members of the steamer were arrested. Initially, one Chinese, one Japanese, and one Korean person boarded the ship, claiming they wanted to meet a certain Chinese crew member of the ship. The Japanese and Korean individuals were armed. Subsequently, a Japanese military police boat carrying plainclothes armed personnel and customs officers docked alongside the ship, demanding to search it. As a result of the search, two gold bars and some silver bars, the quantity of which is unknown, were found and confiscated by the customs officers, who said they would report to the customs authorities. The three Chinese crew members of the steamer were then arrested before the armed personnel left the ship. It is noted that this armed boarding and inspection is highly irregular, as only customs officials are authorized to board and inspect ships. It is reported that Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. has taken up the matter with the relevant authorities. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e14">Wounded Company Commander Returns to the Front Line <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Company Commander Li Zongdai, a disabled officer of the second degree, has applied to return to the front line. He came to Chongqing to report to the responsible authorities and await assignment. Company Commander Li is from Qixia, Shandong, and is twenty-two years old this year. In 1934, he left Nankai Middle School in Tianjin and later joined the Taiyuan Military Branch School. After graduating, he was assigned as a probationary platoon leader in General Pang Bingxun's unit. After the July 7th Incident, he followed the army in battles along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. In the battle of Cangzhou, his leg was hit by shrapnel. After treatment, as his ability to walk was not impaired, he insisted on being discharged from the hospital and returning to the front line. At that time, the Japanese crossed the Yellow River, captured Jinan, and advanced south along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Witnessing the homeland of Confucius and Mencius overrun by the iron hooves of the Japanese army, he was filled with anger and pain. He went to southern Shandong and took a position as a training cadre in the people's anti-Japanese self-defense army, leading a unit of militiamen to conduct guerrilla warfare in Taian, Qufu, Sishui, and other places. Subsequently, Teng County fell, and the right flank was under severe pressure. Li was ordered to return to his original unit and fought in the Battle of Taierzhuang. He charged into battle and was about fifty meters from Taierzhuang when his right eye was pierced by a Japanese bullet. He recovered after several months of treatment. Because his right eye was blind and his left leg was slightly lame, he was classified as a disabled officer of the second degree according to regulations. He was entitled to an annual pension from the state to live out the rest of his life. However, Li was unwilling to live such a leisurely life in the rear and insisted on returning to the front line. Upon arriving in Chongqing, he paid his respects to his alma mater's President Zhang Boling. President Zhang regarded Li's two injuries and his return to the front line as a model for young people and soldiers. In addition to commending him in person, he presented him with a screen bearing the four characters "Sacrifice Self to Save the Country." (23rd dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Disagreement Among British Cabinet Members Regarding European Situation Resolution Plan, Halifax Demands Thorough Investigation of Source, Hudson Declares it Arose from Private Discussion, Chamberlain Declares British Government Has No Intention of Lending Money to Germany <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(London) Herr Walter, a Counselor of the German Ministry of Economics, is currently here to attend the whaling conference. He discussed a plan to resolve the European situation with the British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, last week. Regarding this matter, Hudson issued a statement last night, which has been reprinted by various morning newspapers. The wording is largely the same, but the reaction is remarkable and noteworthy. The Labour Party's Daily Herald stated, "Minister Hudson has discussed a 'plan' with Herr Walter, representative of General Goering, the dictator of the German Four-Year Plan. A certain newspaper revealed its contents a few days ago, claiming that Britain would lend Germany £100 million, and Germany would sign an agreement promising to reduce its existing armaments and setting a limit on future armaments as a condition for the loan. When Foreign Secretary Halifax learned of this, he was furious and insisted on investigating the source of this plan. It is said that Prime Minister Chamberlain will summon Hudson to provide an explanation, and if he is not satisfied, Hudson will inevitably resign to apologize for embarrassing the cabinet." Regarding this matter, Hudson made a statement to reporters from this newspaper last night, saying, "It is true that I discussed a plan with Herr Walter, but so far, the details that have been circulated outside are inconsistent with the truth. I hereby clearly state that my discussions with Herr Walter were conducted entirely in a private capacity, and this will become clear sooner or later." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain recently declared in the House of Commons that the British government has no intention of lending money to Germany, nor does it intend to negotiate this matter. Whether there is any possibility of negotiating this issue, I do not know. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) After the details of the conversations between the Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, and Herr Walter, Counselor of the German Ministry of Economics, were disclosed, there were rumors that Hudson was uneasy in his position. He subsequently provided an explanation to Prime Minister Chamberlain, and the Prime Minister was satisfied, so he is unlikely to resign. (Havas News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding reports that a senior official had initiated a plan to lend Germany £100 million as a reward for Germany's agreement to limit its armaments, the Daily Mail and other newspapers reported today that the Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, had not mentioned it. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Express recently reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to issue a statement to the House of Commons today regarding Britain's intention to lend a huge sum of money to Germany. According to the report, the loan plan was proposed by the British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, to Herr Walter, representative of the German Ministry of Economics. The newspaper believes that when Chamberlain issues the statement regarding the plan, he will firmly express Britain's opposition to Germany's further expansion of its military hegemony in Central Europe. Chamberlain will also advise Germany that if it wants to stop the waste of the arms race and save the world economy from bankruptcy, Germany should pursue a different policy. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the plan for Britain to lend a huge sum of money to Germany, the Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, recently wrote to the Daily Express and the Daily Mail, stating, "The loan plan was not proposed by British officials to Germany, as reported in the newspapers, but was proposed by me to Herr Walter, representative of the German Ministry of Economics, in a private capacity. The amount of the loan was not discussed at the time." It is said that the loan plan suggested that if Germany were willing to abandon Czechoslovakia and were willing to limit or reduce its armaments, Britain would be willing to facilitate Germany's access to world raw materials and provide economic assistance to convert its arms industry into peacetime industries. Hudson touched upon the loan plan in a speech he delivered in Harrogate yesterday, saying that to maintain peace in the world for the next thirty years, countries with overpopulation should redistribute the world's undeveloped land. (Haitong News Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>German Newspapers Mock Loan Strategy</p>
<p>(Berlin) German political circles today acknowledged that when German economic expert Herr Wohlthat spoke with the British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, in London, he may have heard about the possibility of granting Germany a loan. If so, Herr Wohlthat certainly did not listen to it in an official capacity, but rather listened to the opinions expressed by his host as a guest. German newspapers denounced the talk of a loan as British bluster, saying that the loan campaign was a clumsy strategy. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>France Feels Apprehensive</p>
<p>(Paris) Here, there is great satisfaction over the collapse of Germany's "peace offensive," but the uneasy atmosphere caused by another unpleasant piece of news has not been completely eliminated. It is rumored that Britain intends to lend Germany 100 million pounds in exchange for Germany disarming and recognizing the status quo in Europe. While French authorities are confident that they can thwart any German attempt to isolate them, they are still very apprehensive that Britain may seek to "bribe" Germany. France not only loathes the results of Chamberlain's appeasement policy, but is also worried about a new appeasement policy towards Germany through political and economic means behind closed doors. France believes that any such attempt would have major implications and would be detrimental to the country: First, the new appeasement policy would result in France's allies abandoning it one after another; second, Germany, having gained the benefits of the new appeasement policy, would be insatiable and continue to demand concessions. Finally, French authorities believe that Italy's demands for French colonies would also be revived as a result. The French have repeatedly urged London to accept Soviet conditions and conclude a Franco-British-Soviet peace pact, and the above view is the best explanation for this. (Associated Press, 24th)</p>

<p>Warsaw The semi-official Polish newspaper Kurier Polski published an editorial yesterday arguing that the Polish people should fulfill their historical mission of fighting for national freedom and fight for their country with a cheerful spirit. The article stated, "The situation at the mouth of the Vistula River was created by the Treaty of Versailles, and we must now improve it. We believe that it will be difficult to avoid war in order to resolve the Baltic Sea issue. Only guns can calm the development of the Polish nation. The Polish people must go to war together for the issue of the city of Danzig. Poland's territory should include part of German Upper Silesia and all of East Prussia, except for the city of Danzig. If war breaks out, Poland will certainly be able to eliminate the claws of Prussia, lay the foundation for long-term peace for the country, and then conquer Silesia, East Prussia, and Mazovia."

<p>(Moscow) A semi-official statement issued yesterday said that German-Soviet negotiations on trade and credit issues have resumed in Berlin. Observers here commented that the recent rumors have been swirling, saying either that a German military delegation had come to the Soviet Union or that the German ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, would be traveling to Moscow. These rumors are sufficient to create a negative impression, and the Soviet semi-official side has issued the above statement to correct them, not to exert pressure on Britain and France. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to Japanese sources, Germany is negotiating a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. The German Foreign Ministry has firmly denied this, and responsible parties have reiterated that the scope of the current negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union is limited to credit and trade issues. However, the German-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Neutrality, which was concluded on April 20, 1926, is equal in nature to a non-aggression treaty and has not been declared invalid. The Soviet representative in Berlin still seems to regard it as fully valid. According to Article 1 of this treaty, the signatory countries shall maintain contact on all political and economic issues relating to the interests of both parties. Article 2 stipulates that if one of the signatory countries is involved in a conflict with another country without being provoked, the other party shall remain neutral. Article 3 stipulates that if one of the signatory countries is involved in a conflict with another country without being provoked, causing it to suffer financial and economic sanctions, the other party shall not participate.

<p>Hungarian Capital Many oil fields have recently been discovered in various parts of Hungary. If they can be properly developed, the country could become one of the major oil-producing countries in Europe within a few years. Germany has always been very concerned about the development of Hungary's various economic resources. In addition, the success of a certain American company in exploiting oil in Nagykánizsa has attracted even more attention. The company began conducting investigations as early as 1918, when only two oil wells were discovered. Now, the number has increased to twenty, producing 15,000 tons of oil per month, enough to meet four-fifths of the country's needs. Two oil pipelines have also been built, one 16 kilometers long and one 30 kilometers long, running from Nagykánizsa to refineries with a capacity of 320,000 tons. In addition, the oil field in the Mátraverebély area produces only 900 tons of oil per month and there is no prospect of increasing production. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e25">Rumors of Goering's Assassination Resurface; Heated Argument During High-Ranking Leaders Meeting <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(London) According to yesterday's *Reynolds News*, the rumor that German Aviation Minister General Goering was recently injured in an assassination attempt by an unknown number of people has been largely confirmed. This newspaper, a left-wing publication, often publishes sensational news. Yesterday, after quoting official denials of Goering's assassination, the newspaper claimed to have obtained ample information about the incident from refugees newly arrived in Warsaw and German deserters who fled across the border to Poland. The report stated that the incident occurred one night when General Goering and Hitler were driving from Berlin to Goering's Carinhall estate, located forty miles from Berlin. When they were within ten miles of their destination, suddenly six bullets were fired at their car. One bullet struck Goering's arm, but Hitler was unharmed. After the incident, Goering's escort vehicles immediately searched the area and arrested two young German suspects. The newspaper claimed that the assassination attempt occurred after a meeting of high-ranking Nazi leaders, during which a heated argument erupted between Goering and Propaganda Minister Goebbels. During discussions regarding the Danzig issue, Goering advocated for aggressive action. In response, Goebbels mocked Goering's courage, prompting Goering to retort, calling Goebbels a rogue.

<p>(Moscow) The concluding section of an article by Comrade Tevosyan, Chairman of the People's Shipbuilding Industry Committee of the Soviet Union, discussing the country's naval construction, has now been published in its entirety by *Pravda*. It states: "Soviet industry can guarantee that our country's warships will have all the latest necessary technical equipment. Therefore, the various warships now under construction will be exceptionally perfect in all their equipment and will be fully utilized, making their efficiency no less than that of the latest foreign warships." During the celebration of Naval Day, the shipbuilding industry, in addition to completing the construction program for the first half of the year, will also complete several giant ships ahead of schedule as a form of commemoration. In short, our country's working masses will, in a short period, create an extremely powerful fleet in all maritime theaters of the country, including various types of ocean-going vessels, sufficient to effectively safeguard the security of our country's maritime borders.

<p>(Paris) This morning, "Le Populaire," the mouthpiece of the independent socialists, a newspaper sponsored by the French left wing, prominently carried rumors of a possible change in the French cabinet. According to speculation from parliamentary and business circles, the Foreign Minister may be among those replaced. *Le Populaire* reported that Prime Minister Daladier has not yet decided on a successor for the Foreign Minister. It is said that Daladier has two people in mind to succeed Bonnet: one from the Radical Socialist Party and the other from the moderate faction. There are also rumors that the Finance Minister will be replaced. Mandel, the current Colonial Minister, seems to be the most likely successor to Reynaud, as Reynaud and Mandel are the only two current cabinet members who belong to the right wing.

<h3 id="e30">Former Wanping County Magistrate Wang Lengqi Speaks in Hong Kong, Recounting the Lugouqiao Incident <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Lengqi, the former magistrate of Wanping County and a key figure in the Lugouqiao Incident, now resides in Hong Kong. He recently gave an exclusive interview to a reporter from the Associated Press, detailing the facts before and after the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident. The Lugouqiao Incident has attracted worldwide attention. This is the first time the events have been recounted by the protagonist. Mr. Wang stated, "As everyone knows, the Lugouqiao Incident was, in fact, the starting point of this Far Eastern war. Wanping County and the Lugouqiao Bridge are on the Pinghan Railway, only a few miles from Beiping. Wanping and Fengtai on the Pingpu Railway are the most important strongholds of Beiping. After the Japanese army occupied Fengtai in September 1936, they coveted Wanping. Initially, the Japanese announced that they wanted to purchase 6,000 acres of land between Fengtai and Wanping to build barracks and an airfield. At that time, I was the county magistrate. Japanese officials contacted me more than twenty times to negotiate the purchase of land, but each time I refused. The Japanese army then conducted military exercises outside Wanping, ignoring Chinese protests. Eventually, they even conducted night exercises. On the evening of July 7, 1937, at 10 p.m., without prior notification to the Chinese authorities, the Japanese army dispatched a company for field exercises. Under these special circumstances, I ordered the city gates closed as a precaution. I then learned that the Japanese had notified the Chinese authorities in Beiping that one Japanese soldier was missing during the exercises. It was claimed that the soldier was killed by the Chinese garrison or people of Wanping. I immediately ordered a search inside and outside the city, but we could not find any trace of the 'missing' soldier. The Japanese expressed their dissatisfaction and demanded permission for Japanese troops to enter the city to search. When I refused the Japanese demand, the Japanese army fired several shots at Wanping City. Later, I was summoned to Beiping. By this time, it was midnight on July 7th. After arriving in Beiping, I immediately negotiated with the Japanese special service organization. I and the Chinese authorities in Beiping firmly resisted granting permission for Japanese troops to enter Wanping County. The incident almost turned into a comedy when we received notification that the missing Japanese soldier had been found. However, the Japanese were not embarrassed and still insisted that China and Japan investigate the cause of the Japanese soldier's disappearance. The Japanese insisted on immediately forming an investigation team, composed of three members each from China and Japan. I was selected as one of the Chinese representatives. As we were leaving Beiping at dawn, I was invited to meet with Colonel Mutaguchi, the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Wanping. Mutaguchi strongly opposed the formation of an investigation team and demanded that I take emergency measures to punish those responsible for the Japanese soldier's disappearance. When I stated that I could not accept his demands, Colonel Mutaguchi ordered eight Japanese trucks to Wanping, informing me that the Japanese army intended to handle the matter themselves. I immediately left Beiping. When I reached the right side of the iron bridge, about two-thirds of a mile northwest of Wanping City, I was stopped by a Japanese officer. He was carrying a map of Wanping City. I saw a unit of Japanese soldiers behind the Japanese officer, carrying machine guns and mortars, heading towards Wanping County. The officer claimed that the situation was already tense, and if the incident could not be resolved satisfactorily, the Japanese had decided to take military action. Their definition of a satisfactory resolution was that all Chinese troops stationed in Wanping must withdraw, and Japanese troops would enter Wanping from the east gate. Representatives from both sides would negotiate a final resolution. When I protested and insisted on appointing an investigation team to negotiate a resolution, the Japanese officer angrily said that the gates of Wanping City must be opened wide, and if I did not comply with Japanese demands, my life would be in danger. I felt unable to persuade them and traveled with other members of the investigation team to Wanping. After we entered Wanping City, the Japanese army launched a dawn attack on Wanping City with machine guns and mortars. I reported to the Beiping authorities by telephone. At this time, I understood that the Japanese army was determined to seize the city. I then ordered my small number of soldiers to return fire. The battle began. After several hours of intense fighting, both sides suffered casualties. Reinforcements from both sides arrived. The Japanese dispatched 3,000 troops from Fengtai and Beiping, while the Chinese dispatched a battalion of reinforcements led by Colonel Ji Xingwen to Wanping. At 3:30 p.m. on August 8, Japanese Colonel Mutaguchi sent a letter to me through a Chinese civilian, continuing to demand that the Chinese army withdraw from Wanping. I continued to refuse and sent his demands to the Beiping authorities. However, this result angered the Japanese commander, so he ordered a tighter encirclement of Wanping City. A Japanese brigade arrived at the front lines, and the fighting resumed. At the same time, the regiment of He Qifeng stationed at Babao Mountain attacked the flank of the Japanese army, and the fighting was very fierce. At 6 p.m., the Japanese brigade commander sent a letter to me, claiming that the Japanese army would bombard Wanping with heavy artillery, advising the general Chinese population to evacuate, and ordering the two Japanese representatives on the investigation team to leave Wanping before the bombardment. I replied that the Beiping authorities were concerned about the safety of the Chinese civilians and that the two Japanese representatives intended to remain in Wanping City. After receiving my reply, the Japanese immediately bombarded Wanping with heavy artillery, causing extensive damage to the city. At 8 p.m., a battalion of He Qifeng's regiment routed the Japanese army, and the remaining Japanese troops fled to Shagang, taking refuge in the defensive fortifications built by the Chinese army in 1935. At the same time, the attitude of the Beiping authorities hardened, and reinforcements from both sides continued to arrive at the front lines. The Chahar-Suiyuan Political Council also presented a counter-proposal to the Japanese, demanding that the Japanese army immediately withdraw from Fengtai and Wanping. That night, our army launched a night attack on the Japanese army. Because the Japanese army was entrenched in defensive fortifications, our night attack was not very successful. I then learned that the condition for the Japanese army to withdraw from Wanping was that the regular Chinese army would withdraw outside Wanping City, and 300 security guards led by General Shi Yousan would arrive in Wanping from northern Hebei to replace the regular army. However, the security guards did not arrive until the next morning (July 9). It was said that they had been detained by the Japanese en route. Fifty security guards led by Zhou Siqing arrived first. Because Zhou was a pro-Japanese official of the Chahar-Suiyuan Political Council, I resolutely refused to accept them. Soon, the entire team of 300 security guards arrived. They had been disarmed. When they arrived, the Japanese pretended to withdraw, but in fact, they were reinforcing their troops. Although I withdrew my troops at the time, I was aware of the Japanese plot. Later, negotiations continued, but without success. Until the 12th, my subordinates continued to clash with Japanese soldiers. On the 12th, I was summoned to Beiping to participate in negotiations. Along the way, I saw a large concentration of Japanese soldiers. The fairness of the so-called negotiations was evident. While the negotiations were in progress, the Japanese army began a large-scale attack on Wanping. The Sino-Japanese War thus began. On July 30, I was ordered to withdraw from Wanping. At that time, the 29th Army also withdrew from Beiping to southern Hebei. As I left Wanping, I could not help but shed tears. After twenty-three days of bombing, the city had been reduced to rubble. The suffering of the civilians who could not evacuate was particularly heartbreaking. However, this sacrifice was worthwhile. From the ashes of Wanping, a new China has grown, united and moving toward liberation. I deeply regret that I could not perish with the city, but it was worth苟延殘喘(to prolong life uselessly) in order to wait for our army to re-enter Wanping." (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since the fall of Shantou on June 23, the situation in Fuzhou has suddenly become tense due to its proximity to Guangdong. The authorities immediately strengthened coastal defenses and actively evacuated people and goods. As expected, on the afternoon of June 26th, six Japanese destroyers and cruisers arrived off the mouth of the Min River, anchoring in the waters off Mazu Ao and Chuan Shi Island. Together with the existing destroyer and two motorboats, there were a total of seven warships and two motorboats. The cruisers also carried nine aircraft. At 5 a.m. on the 27th, an aircraft carrier carrying more than 30 aircraft arrived off the mouth of the Min River. Five Japanese warships also arrived in the waters of Gaoshan District in Fuqing County, eastern Fujian. At approximately 9 a.m. on the 27th, the Japanese warships launched four motorboats carrying more than 40 sailors, covered by nine aircraft. They also opened fire on the coast of Changmen from the warships, forcibly landing on Chuan Shi Island off the mouth of the Min River, occupying the foreign building of the Great Eastern Electricity Company established on the island by the British. More than eighty young men on the island (the island has more than a hundred households, all engaged in fishing) were captured and taken to the warships, while the elderly and weak were driven off the island. They then installed four gun emplacements on the island, and</p>

<p>Along the coast, and more than two hundred civilian boats plundered in the coastal areas of Minhou, Lianjiang, Changle, and Fuqing counties were all sunk between the first buoy and the second</p>
<p>Courageously Repelled</p>
<p>At 11 a.m. on the 30th, the Japanese warships anchored in Mazu Ao also dispatched more than 20 marines, allied with more than 100 pirates from the Ao, forcibly landing on Yidou Island between Weimen and Chuan Shi, looting extensively before retreating. At approximately 8 a.m. on July 2nd, two Japanese transport ships arrived off the mouth of the Min River, along with many rubber boats, anchoring in the waters off Mazu Ao. There was no action on this day due to heavy fog along the coast. At approximately 9 a.m. on the 2nd, the Japanese warships anchored in Lianjiang County dispatched more than 40 marines, allied with more than 200 pirates from Nan'gan Tang, in more than 30 motorboats and sailboats, covered by aircraft, forcibly landing in Dinghai Township, Lianjiang County. At approximately 3 p.m., they advanced to Xiaocheng Township, about five miles from Dinghai, and the situation became quite serious for a time. The Chinese local forces rushed to intercept them, and at approximately 6 p.m., they retreated from Xiaocheng to Dinghai. At approximately 10 p.m., they retreated onto motorboats and sailboats and left. At approximately 5 p.m. on the 3rd, eight Japanese warships and two submarines anchored in Lianjiang County, and nine Japanese warships in Changle County, all headed toward Pingtan County. At approximately 10 a.m. on the 4th,</p>
<p>Arrived in Pingtan</p>
<p>At approximately 5 p.m., they dispatched more than 50 marines, allied with more than 300 pirates from Yu Ahuang's gang from Dongsha Island, to invade Guanyin Ao in the northeast of Pingtan again, covered by four aircraft. The warships also opened fire on the shore to boost their morale. The local forces stationed on the island immediately rose up to meet them. They held out for one night, and at approximately 9 a.m. on the 5th, unable to withstand the bombing by the aircraft and the shelling by the artillery, they began to cover a portion of the population to cross the sea and retreat to Fuqing County. Pingtan was thus lost. After the Japanese soldiers and pirates landed, they appointed Yu Ahuang as "county magistrate" and searched the people for food, legal tender, and young men to transport to the warships. At approximately 9 a.m. on the 6th, three of the seventeen Japanese warships anchored in Pingtan returned to Chuan Shi Island and Mazu Ao off the mouth of the Min River. From the 7th to the 11th, the Japanese warships along the coast of eastern Fujian remained unchanged. There were a total of twelve warships in Chuan Shi Island and Mazu Ao, five in Fuqing, and fourteen in Pingtan. As for air raid alarms, they were constant, with as many as six or seven per day, and at least three. Each time, the number of aircraft taking off ranged from one or two to eight or nine.</p>
<p>Bombing Locations</p>
<p>Mostly in various places along the coast off the mouth of the Min River. There have been few casualties among the people. As for the city of Fuzhou, all factories have been moved out, and most of the shops have also closed. More than half of the people have been evacuated. The streets are very quiet and have completely entered a state of war. However, the order remains very good.</p>

<p>Guilin Correspondence: Guilin is located in the northwest corner of Guangxi Province, not far from Hunan Province. The customs and folklore are roughly similar to those of Hunan, and the language is also similar to that of Hunan. However, the vigor and vitality are, after all, different from those of Hunan. As far as Guilin is concerned, whether in the city or countryside, rich or poor, old or young, eight or nine out of ten people are wearing military uniforms and black cloth shoes.</p>
<p>Simple Living</p>
<p>Even we wanderers cannot live here. Precisely because it is simple, they value extra money very much. Because men throughout Guangxi Province have to go to war to maintain order, most of the people farming and going to the market are women. Even if there are men, they are at least fifty years old. Before dawn, they carry a load of firewood or rice and vegetables into the city to sell, and then exchange it for a load of lime or pig feed and run back to eat. Some eat before entering the city, so Guilin has both a morning market and an afternoon market. During these two market times, it is simply impossible to walk on the sidewalks. Recently, because people are afraid of air raid alarms in the morning, the afternoon is especially crowded. The night market lasts until at least twelve o'clock. The scenery of Guilin is indeed extraordinary. The mountains of Guilin are entirely stone mountains. At the junctions of the large stones, there are large old pines and lush small bushes. At the same time, the mountains of Guilin, unlike anywhere else, do not slowly rise and slowly fall. They are completely one to the east and one to the west. These mountains are so high that it can really make your neck stiff from looking up, and each mountain is very, very close. And of these many mountains, there is practically no mountain without a cave. It is truly</p>
<p>Mountains with Caves</p>
<p>These caves are connected or not connected. The large ones can hold seventy or eighty thousand people, and the small ones can hold at least seventy or eighty people. Each mountain cave is a natural air raid shelter. These air raid shelters, no matter how many thousand-kilogram heavy bombs you throw at them, are very difficult to destroy. Therefore, although many houses in Guilin City have been bombed, the number of casualties is very, very small. Unlike other places, where dozens die and hundreds are injured when there is a bombing. Therefore, every sunny morning, there is a constant stream of friends taking mountain cave tours and avoiding air raid alarms. Seven Star Cave is the most famous mountain cave in Guilin.</p>
<p>The Cave is Large</p>
<p>Winding for as long as three or four li. In large places, twenty or thirty thousand people can hold meetings, and in small places, only one person can pass through. The rocks in the mountain cave have things like rabbit heads, Jiang Taigong fishing pool, fishing nets, Taibai Jinxing alchemy platform, lychee mountain, Buddha hand mountain, stone drum, eagle catching chicks, there are so many that it is impossible to remember them all clearly. The few names listed above are all extremely realistic wonders. Elephant Trunk Hill is also very strange. It is a mountain in the river with a hole passing through below. Looking at the mountain from a distance, it really looks like an elephant's nose stretching into the river to drink water. And boats travel back and forth in this hole. Also, when the sky is overcast, the mountain fog covers the mountainside, and the sharp mountain peaks are hidden and visible. Sometimes, miles of mountain fog looks like a dragon, which is very beautiful.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Steps and Measures for the Ministry of Education to Organize University Courses - University Courses to be Piloted from This Autumn for One Year - Specialized Courses to Begin Compilation after Summer Vacation - Courses to be Revised Once Every Five Years Starting the Year after Next <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education's Statistics Department recently published an article entitled "Steps and Measures for Organizing University Courses," as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing courses is not a matter that can be accomplished with a mere sigh. Therefore, after several years of effort, it has not yet been promulgated. In February of the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], after Minister Chen took office, he was determined to improve courses and decided on the principles for organizing courses as: (1) setting unified standards; (2) emphasizing basic training; (3) emphasizing essential subjects. A draft of the "Measures for Organizing Courses in the Liberal Arts, Science, and Law Colleges of Universities" was prepared and sent to professors and experts in universities across the country for consultation. It was supported by a large number of people. The principles proposed in the draft are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Setting Unified Standards: University courses have always been determined by each school, allowing for free development according to local conditions. However, the standards set by each school are quite different, resulting in different subjects and uneven levels, losing the consistent spirit of university education. Therefore, the first principle of organizing university courses is to establish unified standards, starting with the mandatory courses. Elective courses will not be fully determined for the time being, leaving room for each school to consider and adapt. This regulation not only aims to raise the level of general university courses, but also to align with national cultural and construction policies.</p>
<p>(2) Emphasizing Basic Training: The existing courses in universities divide into specialized fields too early, and the basic training in general academics is not well-grounded. The various disciplines complement each other and have no strict boundaries. Students specialize too early, which is not in line with the path of advanced studies. Therefore, university courses should first pay attention to the cultivation of a broad academic foundation. The most basic subjects in liberal arts, science, and law should be designated as common mandatory courses, and then students should specialize in one field, so as to conform to the principle of proceeding from breadth to depth, and prevent students from becoming biased due to specialized research.</p>
<p>(3) Emphasizing Essential Subjects: The setting of subjects in general universities is inevitably too complicated, and the knowledge gained by students is inevitably fragmented and disorganized, failing to grasp the essentials and the gist of a scientific discipline. Therefore, the setting of university subjects in the future should strive for integration and concentration, so that students can have sufficient cultivation and in-depth study of the essential subjects of a discipline, and have a spirit of integration. All obscure and trivial subjects can be studied by students on their own and will not be included in the university curriculum. As for the organizing measures, the original draft listed nine organizing items:</p>
<p>1.  The mandatory and elective courses of all colleges and departments in national universities shall be determined by the Ministry. Mandatory courses must be uniform throughout the country. Elective courses may be adjusted by each school within the scope prescribed by the Ministry, with reference to actual needs.</p>
<p>2.  In the first academic year of each university college, emphasis should be placed on basic subjects, without dividing into departments. Departments will be divided from the second academic year onwards. In the third and fourth academic years, practical subjects will be set up as appropriate, depending on the nature of each college and department, in preparation for employment after graduation.</p>
<p>3.  Chinese and foreign languages are basic tools. Strict examinations should be held at the end of the first academic year. Chinese should be able to read ancient and modern books and write fluent texts. Foreign languages should be able to read foreign language reference books for the subjects studied in each college in order to pass. Otherwise, students must continue to study until they reach the above standards before they can graduate.</p>
<p>4.  Universities will still adopt the academic year system. The amount of learning in each subject can be calculated in credits. Each credit stipulates that the teacher must teach for one hour per week, and the student must study on their own for two hours per week. For subjects that require more self-study time, the teacher's teaching time should be reduced to one hour per week for every two credits.</p>
<p>5.  In addition to lectures and discussions by teachers, teaching in each subject should simultaneously emphasize self-study, discussion, and exercises or experiments. The scope of examinations should include not only the materials taught by the teachers, but also the materials for self-study, discussion, and exercises or experiments.</p>
<p>6.  Teachers should specify in detail the list of self-study books and other reference materials for each subject, supervise students to read them on time, and make notes. Students in liberal arts colleges should study famous works of ancient and modern times, one or several for each subject. Discussions should also be held during class to cultivate students' spirit of independent research.</p>
<p>7.  The number of exercises or experiments that students must do must be clearly specified for each subject. All exercise and experiment reports should be reviewed by the teacher on time.</p>
<p>8.  In addition to requiring students to pay attention to their usual exercises, each department should also specify several important subjects in the senior year courses to guide students in writing academic papers. The topics should be assigned or approved by the faculty.</p>
<p>9.  Graduation examinations should include important subjects in the four academic years of each college and department. The types of subjects can be determined by each school, but there must be more than five types.</p>
<p>Based on the above requirements, the courses are divided into three categories: (1) common mandatory; (2) departmental mandatory; (3) departmental elective. The steps for organizing and compiling them are planned as follows: (1) Investigate the subjects of each college and department in national universities, analyze and study them; (2) Invite professors from each university to express their opinions, and formulate an ideal subject list for each department; (3) Based on the actual situation of each school, and with reference to the opinions of each professor, invite experts to prepare the following drafts separately: 1. Draft list of common mandatory subjects for each college/department of Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Engineering, Agriculture, Commerce, and Teacher Training; 2. Draft list of departmental mandatory and elective subjects for each department; (4) Send the draft list of common mandatory subjects for each college/department to experts and presidents/deans for review, convene meetings for discussion, and issue them to each school for trial implementation; (5) Send the draft list of departmental mandatory and elective subjects to several experts in the same department for review; (6) Send the original draft and review opinions to each college for distribution to professors and lecturers in each department to convene meetings to discuss and express opinions; (7) Based on the opinions expressed by each college and department, revise the draft again, convene a university course division discussion meeting, determine the departmental subject list, and issue it to each college for trial implementation; (8) The 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939] will be the period for each university/college to pilot the newly revised curriculum. The results of the trial implementation and the outline of each subject should be reported to the Ministry by the autumn of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940]; (9) In the autumn of the 29th year, convene the second university course discussion meeting, revise the subjects based on the results of the trial implementation, and formulate the university course outline; (10) From the 30th year of the Republic [i.e., 1941], implement the prescribed courses, and revise them once every five years thereafter; (11) The curriculum of each vocational school will be compiled starting in the autumn of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939]. The steps will be the same as the measures for organizing university courses.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Rumors Have Become the Past - Shanghai's Financial Situation Turns Stable - Banks Receive Many New Deposits - Foreign Exchange Prices Have Reached the Lowest Level <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been many rumors in the market, some saying that the Ministry of Finance will issue new decrees to restrict withdrawals again, and some saying that certain banks will withdraw from Shanghai, which has caused great anxiety among the people. The reporter interviewed an authority in the banking industry to inquire about the truth. According to him, the original intention of the Ministry of Finance was to tighten the money supply and prevent foreign exchange speculation and arbitrage, but it unexpectedly led to villains spreading rumors and rushing to withdraw from banks. The withdrawal tide has long passed, and banks have received many new deposits. However, the current money supply in the market is still suffering from excessive tightening. The Ministry of Finance will certainly not restrict withdrawals again, causing unnecessary disturbances. As for the current sharp contraction of foreign exchange, it can reduce imports and greatly reduce the demand for foreign exchange. Moreover, with the tightening of the money supply in the market, foreign exchange prices have reached the lowest level and will not contract again. This is a simple and easy-to-understand relationship between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Stabilizes</p>
<p>Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee maintained the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, the HSBC Bank of England has continued to provide as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries. Therefore, the foreign exchange black market price has stabilized. Yesterday morning, the HSBC Bank of England quoted the pound sterling at four pence and the US dollar at 7.75 yuan, the same as the quotation on Saturday. The actual market price was four pence and a half for the pound sterling and 8.75 yuan for the US dollar, which had eased. Then, the foreign exchange price tightened again due to the fierce buying by Japanese banks. However, because the yarn brokers were tight, they retaliated, so although the Japanese banks bought fiercely, the price did not tighten very much.</p>
<p>Gold Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>After the gold black market assembly point opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, it rose to 3,830 yuan at the opening.</p>
<p>It then fell to 3,500 yuan. The morning closing was 3,600 yuan, and the afternoon closing was 3,550 yuan. The major silver and gold shops initially quoted 350 yuan yesterday morning, then changed to 400 yuan, and finally to 360 yuan. The quotation was changed six or seven times in one day.</p>
<p>Securities Decline</p>
<p>In the securities black market, after the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank allowed discounting and borrowing of the principal and interest of the unified government bonds due at the end of July, the unified government bonds rebounded sharply. Yesterday morning, due to reports of British and Japanese compromise news, speculators spread rumors again, causing prices to fall back. The closing price of Type A was 50 yuan and 4 jiao, down 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen. Type B was 42 yuan and 1 jiao, down 1 yuan and 9 jiao. Type C was 41 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, down 1 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen. Type D was 40 yuan and 2 jiao, down 1 jiao. Type E was 40 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen, down 2 yuan. Regarding the remittance exchange rate, yesterday it was 250 yuan.</p>
<p>Japanese Yarn Hit</p>
<p>According to a report from the mainland, "China News and Opinions Compilation" criticized yesterday (the 23rd) that the decline in the value of legal tender is a major blow to Japanese yarn mills, because the Japanese side cannot dump its cotton yarn in the local market and other parts of the occupied areas. At present, Japanese-operated spindles in Shanghai are no less than 1.3 million, while those operated by Chinese merchants are only 500,000. The Japanese obtained legal tender by issuing Huaxing banknotes and military tickets, and purchased a large amount of foreign cotton. In the first five months of the year, it reached more than 59 million yuan, six times the amount of foreign cotton imported in the same period last year. They used Shanghai's cheap labor to make a large amount of foreign cotton into cotton yarn and dumped it in the Chinese market, making huge profits. The victims are the Chinese. Now that the value of legal tender has fallen, Japanese yarn mills will find that the cost of purchasing foreign cotton is very high, making it difficult for them to compete with locally made cotton yarn.</p>
<p>Concert at Zhaofeng Park</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold a string concert at Zhaofeng Park on the afternoon of the 25th from 9:00 to 11:00 (weather permitting). There are seven programs.</p>

<p>In order to raise funds for construction projects, the National Government issued the 28th Year of the Republic [i.e., 1939] Construction Government Bonds, with a total amount of 600 million yuan in national currency. It is stipulated that they will be issued in two phases, with 300 million yuan in each phase. The first phase was issued on April 1 at face value. The second phase will be issued on August 1. The interest rate is set at 6% per annum. The repayment of the principal of the bonds will begin on January 31, 1942, and will be paid off in 25 years. The surplus profits of the state-owned enterprises that have been established and newly established, as well as the special funds for construction projects added to the salt tax, are designated as the fund and are managed by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The repayment of principal and interest is designated as the Central Bank and its entrusted banks.</p>
<h3 id="e50">New Foreign Exchange Pool: Allocation Among Banks and Money Shops - Banks Allocated 40 Million Yuan, Money Shops Notified to Allocate 10 Million Yuan - Collateral Extremely Solid, Credit Beyond Question <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>To restrict withdrawals and consolidate the foundation of the legal tender, the banking and money industries previously joined with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Bank of China, and the Foreign Banks' Association to prepare for and implement a new foreign exchange pool system. In addition to separately appointing members of various committees, the total amount of this new foreign exchange pool was set at 50 million yuan in national currency. It is understood that the amounts allocated to each bank and shop have now been fully determined. The Commercial Bank of China has been allocated 25 million yuan, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China together 15 million yuan, and the money shops 10 million yuan, totaling 50 million yuan.</p>
<p>Banks Allocated 40 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The members of the Bankers' Association, except for some state-owned banks, are all privately-owned commercial banks. For this new foreign exchange pool system, although the allocation of the total amount of exchange ticket reserves has been actively implemented, each bank must also provide collateral at this time to guarantee the total amount of exchange tickets. According to a banking magnate speaking to a Dagongshe reporter yesterday, the allocation of the 25 million yuan for commercial banks is nearing completion, with each bank providing written descriptions of the collateral. The 15 million yuan for state-owned banks is being allocated by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China, and the association is not responsible for the allocation.</p>
<p>Money Shops Notified to Allocate 10 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Money Shops Association has more than 40 member shops. For the implementation of the new foreign exchange pool system, this fixed amount of 10 million yuan must be allocated and distributed in advance. Unlike the banks, where the association handles the allocation on their behalf, according to a Dagongshe reporter's inquiry yesterday, the Money Shops Association, due to the imminent implementation of the new foreign exchange pool, has already notified each member shop separately to inquire about the amount of reserves needed. Once the reports are received, the total amount and descriptions of the collateral to be provided can be compiled and submitted to the review committee, so that each shop can be reviewed whenever it uses these new tickets.</p>
<p>Strict Restrictions on Attached Collateral</p>
<p>The total amount of the new foreign exchange pool reserves has already been allocated. However, each bank and shop must attach reliable collateral within its ticket issuing authority. The strictness of this collateral is to solidify the credit of the exchange tickets, so that all industries can firmly believe in it and circulate it in the market. The types of collateral are limited to cash, silver, title deeds, securities, and goods. After review by the review committee, the tickets can then be circulated.</p>
<p>More Innovative Procedures for Obtaining</p>
<p>The implementation of the new foreign exchange system is more creditworthy than previous checks and promissory notes. Checks are sometimes returned, and promissory notes often have usage limits. Although this new type of ticket is similar to the previous ones for money shops, once the recipient verifies it, it can be used at any time. Banks and money shops can present the ticket to foreign banks, and can also transfer it to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China. It is expected that future attempts by malicious individuals to undermine the currency policy will be difficult to implement, because it is impossible to withdraw cash or speculate in foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Withdrawal of Deposits in Accordance with Regulations</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the payment of exchange notes, there is much rumor due to a lack of clarity. Specific details are as follows: (1) Deposits made before August 13 will be handled in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's financial stability measures. Whether fixed or current deposits, except for companies and firms that genuinely need it for commercial purposes, which may be paid by interbank transfer, private individuals and ancestral halls will not be accommodated in any way to prevent currency outflow. (2) Deposits made after August 13 will be handled in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's telegraphic instructions, that is, starting from June 22, for deposit payments, except for those paying wages, withdrawals up to 500 yuan per week will be paid in legal tender, and amounts exceeding 500 yuan will be paid by exchange, for interbank transfers only. However, there is no restriction on exchange payments.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Legal Tender for Place Names in North China - Immediate Payment of Sight Drafts - If Purchasing Local Products, Funds May be Remitted Inland - Banks Considering Ways to Smooth the Process <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>After the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications made efforts to redeem small amounts of banknotes from place names in North China, the situation has gradually stabilized. It is now reported that the two banks, in order to prevent speculators from taking advantage and to encourage capital to flow into the interior, have been notified by their head offices to revise the following two measures: (1) All those who come to redeem banknotes issued in the name of Tianjin, Shandong, and Lu or Hankou notes issued by the Bank of Communications will be paid with sight drafts payable in the original issuing location or in Chongqing. (2) To facilitate the purchase of local products in the interior by holders of notes, remittance to the interior may be considered. After these measures are taken, it is hoped that a solution will be found for those who already hold banknotes from North China and Hankou, and that it will no longer be profitable to transport banknotes to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Banks Consider Ways to Smooth the Process</p>
<p>Banks are currently considering ways to smooth the process. It is reported that the Trust Department of the New China Bank has already been entrusted by some domestic goods manufacturers and inland schools to handle purchasing and payment of tuition fees. Therefore, for all funds remitted to Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, and other inland areas such as Pingjin, preferential exchange rates will be offered. Recently, it has also accepted remittances of banknotes from North China and Hankou. If banknotes from North China and Hankou are redeemed in whole amounts, it may also be accommodated at the respective exchange rates. As the season for inland products arrives, many manufacturers need to take cash to the interior to purchase goods. If all banks can do the same, the difficulties of inland exchange can be somewhat eased, and the circulation of banknotes from Hankou and North China in the market can also be greatly helped.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reports that residents of the western district of Shanghai heard the sound of machine guns and the explosions of hand grenades and mortar shells last night (the 23rd) while going to bed. Chinese guerrillas were again clashing with Japanese soldiers. However, the scale is far larger than any of the past three or four months. The battle began at 7:30 in the Hongqiao and Longhua districts and was still going on at 1:30 this morning (the 24th). The repeated sounds of machine guns and mortars indicate that the Japanese soldiers were not just practicing. The Japanese army used illuminating mortar shells to detect the location of the guerrillas, followed by the sound of heavy machine guns and intermittent hand grenade explosions. According to Chinese sources last night, a large unit of 3,000 men from the New Fourth Army had arrived in the suburbs of Shanghai. This unit had been active in the Suzhou area, hindering Japanese military transportation. It was decided to cross the river. Now that the new Chinese troops have arrived, the Japanese army has also received reinforcements, constantly disturbing the villages west of the concession. The New Fourth Army is now building trenches and stationed not far from the Hongqiao Airport.</p>

<p>According to shipping industry sources, five Japanese warships arrived in the Xiaocheng waters on the morning of the 22nd, opening fire and launching several speedboats full of armed Japanese soldiers, attempting to land under the cover of artillery fire. The Chinese garrison immediately returned fire. However, due to the strict Chinese defenses, the Japanese troops were unsuccessful. Currently, more than ten Japanese warships are moored outside the mouth of the Min River.</p>
<p>Haimen Bombed</p>
<p>Haimen in Zhejiang was bombed by three Japanese aircraft at around 9:00 a.m. on the 21st and 22nd. Chinese losses were minimal. Currently, four Japanese warships are moored in the Taizhou waters, constantly launching speedboats and patrolling the coast. Two Japanese warships arrived in the Huanghua waters of Wenzhou on the morning of the 23rd, firing more than ten shots at the shore before leaving. Although the port of Wenzhou is currently blockaded, the situation is very peaceful, and the market is gradually flourishing.</p>

<p>French Concession on Special Alert</p>
<p>The Sino-American Daily and Evening News offices at 130 Changgeng Lane, Avenue Edward VII, were suddenly attacked at 8:30 p.m. last Saturday by more than 20 thugs armed with Mauser pistols and hand grenades in four Yunfei automobiles. They attempted to break into the two newspapers to commit violence. However, the Sino-American Daily's tea boy, Mr. Wu, cleverly closed the iron gate, preventing the thugs from entering the Sino-American Daily. The thugs then took out their weapons and fired at the Sino-American Daily, while also breaking into the composing room of the Evening News to carry out sabotage, while also firing randomly. At that time, the Chinese and Western police officers and the head patrol officer on duty nearby heard the alarm and immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene and surround the thugs. Because they resisted with guns, the detectives also fired back, and bullets flew everywhere. A group of thugs took the opportunity to escape the encirclement in the original cars numbered 12235, speeding away.</p>
<p>Sabotage Carried Out</p>
<p>When they fled through the intersection of Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road, they encountered the patrol team of the Lao Zha Police Station, resulting in a second fierce battle. In total, more than 200 shots were fired by both sides, and as many as 23 people were killed or injured by stray bullets, including three dead and twenty injured. One of the dead was a British citizen. The details have been reported in this newspaper. At that time, Western Detective Chief Mao Ya, Chinese Detective Chief Liao Guihe, Detective Kang Zengxiang, Gao Zhen, and others from the General Police Department arrested Shen Yufeng (26 years old, from Jiangbei, residing at 10 Huangjia Lane, Daxi Road), and arrested Ding Rongsheng (39 years old, from Zhenjiang), Ju Bailin (32 years old, from Jiangbei), Zhang Ruzeng (32 years old, from Jiangbei), and Tan Zhixing (24 years old, from Jiangbei). Ding, Ju, and Zhang were all suffering from gunshot wounds. The Lao Zha Police Station also arrested Wu Yiwei (29 years old, from Guangdong, residing at 12 Cihe Lane, Jiujiang Road). It is understood that when Shen Yufeng was arrested, he was still carrying weapons. The above-mentioned detainees were transferred to Criminal Division 1 of Special Court No. 1 by the police station at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, briefly stated the facts. He said that after the arrest of the suspects, the police station immediately launched an investigation. Although a part of it has been clarified, it cannot be made public at present, and the case is complicated and the investigation will take time. Therefore, he requested that the case be postponed for two weeks for further investigation. As for the suspect Shen Yufeng, his past conduct was particularly bad. He had been judged by the law about ten times for crimes. Wu Yiwei had also been subject to criminal sanctions. Judge Xiao Xieben approved the request and ordered the suspects to be temporarily detained and the hearing postponed to Tuesday. The bodies of Huang Xiwu and Qian Zaisheng, who were killed by stray bullets, were also inspected by Prosecutor Song of Special Court No. 1 yesterday morning, confirming that they were killed by bullets, and ordered their bodies to be collected.</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Detail the Events</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that as a result of the violence committed by terrorists on Avenue Edward VII on Saturday night, detectives from the Central and Lao Zha Police Stations have recovered eleven potato-shaped hand grenades, six new-style automatic Mauser pistols, and 200 empty shell casings. They interrogated the suspects, witnesses, and patrols on the scene day and night yesterday in an effort to investigate the case. According to what is known for certain, this violence was meticulously organized but ultimately failed. It now seems that in addition to the 20 people who arrived at Jiangxi Road in four Yunfei automobiles at around 8:15 p.m. on Saturday, there were also a large number of accomplices and so-called "lookouts" stationed at key points to deal with every patrol officer stationed nearby. The terrorists entered 130 Changgeng Lane, Avenue Edward VII in three groups. The English "Evening News," the American "Sino-American Daily," and the printing house of the English-language Continental Daily are all located in this lane, adjacent to the Thames Building. The terrorists intended to disrupt the above-mentioned newspaper offices, kill people, and destroy machines as much as possible, to prevent the newspapers from being published. More than ten terrorists broke into the Evening News on the second floor of the Thames Building, firing many shots and killing one typesetting worker. Another dozen or so terrorists broke into the "Sino-American Daily" on the third floor, but were blocked from entering because the door was locked. Another team of terrorists broke into the Tonghui Trust Company opposite the Thames Building. An elderly tea boy from the company tried to close the door in front of the armed thugs and was shot and killed. At the same time, the terrorists became frightened and retreated in embarrassment into Changgeng Lane, turning toward Avenue Edward VII, firing into the sky and brandishing hand grenades as they fled. At that time, one hand grenade was thrown out, and another exploded in front of the Thames Building. Many terrorists fled into the French Concession, and gun parts and bullets have been found in various streets of the French Concession.</p>
<p>Opening Fire on People</p>
<p>Most of the terrorists fled into Jiangxi Road and threw out the third hand grenade. At least one group of terrorists got into their cars on that road and drove back to their hideout. However, they encountered a patrol search team on Hankou Road. Two of the four cars occupied by the terrorists were found abandoned in the French Concession. The third car was hit by five bullets by the patrol on Hankou Road and could not drive. The events of Saturday indicate that these terrorists were undoubtedly the same terrorists who committed a similar act of violence at the Guide News editorial office at 130 Ningbo Road on June 16. Furthermore, it seems certain that the hand grenades used by the terrorists on Saturday were the same as the two hand grenades found on Nanjing Road on the morning of July 16. The two grenades may have been discarded at the last moment by the terrorists, who decided to throw them away because they were too dangerous. At the same time, a large number of suspects have been interrogated thoroughly.</p>
<p>Confidential Interrogation</p>
<p>The police officers in charge of handling the case refused to disclose any information about the case yesterday. However, it is heard that only four suspects are still being held. Most of them have committed crimes and are from Jiangbei. However, the events of Saturday were truly shocking and were a rare display of courage in this city. Wilson, who died at 9:30 p.m. on Saturday night from a bullet wound in the heart, was attending to customers in a tavern across the street from the shooting when he heard the sound and ran to the door, intending to cross the street to help the patrol officers. His friend tried to stop him, advising him not to risk being shot. However, Mr. Hui shook off his friend's grip and ran toward Changgeng Lane. When Mr. Hui was about to arrive, fifteen shots were fired at him, and Mr. Wilson was seriously injured. He tried to use his last strength to run across the street back to the tavern, but collapsed in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>Collapsed</p>
<p>A French soldier crawled to the side of the injured Mr. Wilson, risking great danger to drag him to the French Concession and call an ambulance to rush him to the hospital. A Chinese detective, who had already been shot and was lying in a pool of blood, apparently shot by the patrol officers, still held a gun in one hand and raised his detective badge to fire at the fleeing terrorists until they had escaped. The detective was also rushed to the hospital. Western Head Constable Weiduson was nearby and also risked his life to run into Changgeng Lane and capture one of the suspects currently being held. When the suspect was captured, he was holding a Mauser pistol and a hand grenade in each hand. In the subsequent exchange of fire on Hankou Road, Trainee Western Head Constable Cibufuloski, who led the search team, was quite brave. Although within range of the terrorists' guns, he only fired when he was sure that he would not harm pedestrians. He also captured two suspects. A Chinese patrol officer had his handgun stolen by the terrorists when they exited the lane. Although outnumbered, he still chased after them, and was shot in the right knee and fell to the ground. He should also be given special attention. While the detectives were busy working in the office, the reserve patrol officers of the police department searched various hotels and shooting locations from 8:30 p.m. on Saturday night to 8:00 a.m. yesterday, continuing to search for weapons. The injuries of the injured people have not changed. Three of them are seriously injured, and the others, although needing treatment, are only slightly injured. Hope Skajaya, a 19-year-old dancer at the Palais Cafe, was shot in the knee when she got off a public bus at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Avenue Edward VII. It is heard that her injury has slightly improved yesterday and she has been transferred to the Russian Church Hospital on Shanzhong Road. At the same time, senior police officers held a meeting yesterday morning to study the severe precautionary measures to be taken to prevent similar incidents. The four suspects are scheduled to be tried at Special Court No. 1 this morning. The police department will request that they be remanded in custody. Coroner Luten and Executor Compel of the U.S. Court for China inspected Wilson's body yesterday morning and approved its transfer to the International Funeral Home. The trial is scheduled to begin at 10:30 a.m. this morning. The details of how the terrorists obtained the four cars were also found out yesterday. It seems that one of the terrorists rented four cars from the Yunfei Car Rental Company on Yidingpan Road at around 8:00 p.m., and after getting into the first car, followed the other three cars to Zhuanbang Lane. The North China Daily News reported on July 7 that this lane housed the headquarters of 150 heavily armed terrorists, and on July 2, the search team of the police department was shot at in this lane. After the four cars arrived at the lane, about 20 people got into the cars and ordered the drivers to drive to Jiangxi Road, where the shooting began. Although not confirmed, it seems certain that the terrorist group was instigated by an organization supporting a certain party.</p>
<p>Appears Certain</p>
<p>According to the general opinion yesterday, the police department will strongly negotiate with the "Great Way" authorities regarding special criminals entering the public concession at will from Yidingpan Road and other boundary roads. The trial of the two Chinese men who were shot and killed is scheduled to begin this morning. It is heard that the injuries of the injured suspects are still satisfactory, enough for the detectives in charge of the case to interrogate them. The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the French Concession Police Department has taken special precautions to prevent a recurrence of the terrorist attack on Avenue Edward VII on Saturday night, sending out two mobile armored vehicles to guard outside the Great American Evening Post building, and erecting barbed wire on Haig Road near Yidingpan Road, where the terrorists have their headquarters. The Public Concession Police Department is also on alert and has stepped up its patrol measures.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Yesterday's Chaotic Rice Market: Highest Grade White Rice Reaches Price Ceiling; Rice Merchants Claim Unobtainable at Limit <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the price of rice in this city has continued to rise, leading to chaotic trading in the rice market. The highest grade of white rice has already reached the price ceiling of 20 yuan per picul (stone). The Rice Merchants' Guild reported that their members are saying that there is no high-quality rice available in the market. Purchasing at the limited price only yields the lowest grade rice, which the public misunderstands, causing difficulties for businesses. They requested a proper plan to maintain the situation. The Guild held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 4 p.m. yesterday to discuss the issue in detail. They resolved to advise all member rice merchants to be patient for the time being. When purchasing goods in the market, they must strictly adhere to the price ceiling and not exceed it. Any under-the-table transactions exceeding the price will be accounted for at the limited price. Any such transactions should be reported to the Guild so that it can be reported to the authorities for investigation. At the same time, the Guild will formulate appropriate measures to cope with the situation. They will also send a letter to the Public Works Department (工部局) reporting the chaotic market conditions and the impossibility of purchasing high-quality goods at the fixed price, requesting them to strictly correct the situation in order to maintain the price ceiling.</p>
<p>Price Ceiling Revision Immediately Causes Rice Price to Rise</p>
<p>The authorities in the International Settlement and rice industry groups agreed on a good strategy to set a price ceiling of 21 yuan, with proportionate differentials for medium-grade and lower-grade rice. Since its implementation, the price of rice has fallen daily. *Changbang tejing* (常帮特粳, a type of rice) even fell below the 20 yuan mark. Therefore, the authorities in the International Settlement, seeing that rice prices were trending towards equilibrium, revised the price ceiling to 20 yuan. However, as soon as it was implemented, the trend changed from sluggish to expensive. Furthermore, the foreign exchange situation has tightened recently, making it likely that it will not be possible to continue ordering Saigon rice. As a result, rice merchants are taking the opportunity to cause trouble, and outsiders are hoarding and manipulating the market, leading to a sharp rise in market prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Highly Abnormal</p>
<p>Today, the 24th, the market situation appears highly abnormal. All kinds of damaged and old rice are approaching the 20 yuan mark. The situation is very chaotic. People in the rice industry are repeatedly asking the supervisors in the market to lift the price ceiling. However, they are all resolutely refused. However, given this situation where one side is seeking high prices and the other side is seeking low prices, the rice market is bound to come to a standstill. As a result, the more than 400 rice merchants involved in direct transactions will be greatly affected, indirectly affecting the food supply for citizens throughout the city.</p>
<p>Stock Owners Should Be Forced</p>
<p>Therefore, it is hoped that rice merchants will cooperate with each other and resist this abnormal rice market by refusing to purchase. On the other hand, it is hoped that the authorities will impose the strictest mandatory measures on the stocks and owners of all rice warehouses, ensuring that they sell at the limited price. After implementation, it may be possible to temporarily curb the arrogance of hoarders.</p>

<p>Police and Italian Officers Discussing the Matter</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that last night (the 23rd) at nearly 8 p.m., Police Officer Watterson, responsible for the Bubbling Well Road police station, was dragged into the "Great Way" (大道) Police Station and mistreated after tearing down an anti-British poster near the Italian Marine Corps headquarters on Robison Road. At the time, Watterson was not in uniform. Several minutes later, the Italian Marine Corps arrived and surrounded the "Great Way" Police Station, ordering the "Great Way" police stationed on the public concession roads along Robison Road to leave. The "Great Way" police complied, and Watterson was released.</p>
<p>Bayonets Fixed</p>
<p>A unit of Italian Marine Corps faced the police station and stood guard for over an hour. Due to their swift and forceful action, a major unfortunate incident was avoided. The commander of the Italian troops stationed in Shanghai told reporters last night that he received news of the incident and sent his troops to the scene. He did not think much of it and considered it over. He ordered the "Great Way" police to leave the public concession roads because they had no right to be stationed there armed. While Watterson was being mistreated in the police station, the station telephoned another "Great Way" police station requesting reinforcements. As a result, a truckload of reinforcing "Great Way" police</p>
<p>travelled along Kiaochow Road</p>
<p>but were soon stopped by an Italian patrol. The Italian officer told the "Great Way" police that if they wanted to go to the Robison Road police station, they could go, but they were not allowed to carry weapons on the public concession roads. The "Great Way" police then left the truck and left their weapons, running to the Robison Road police station. The posters that were being torn down were</p>
<p>removed by Italian soldiers.</p>
<p>It was later confirmed that the anti-British posters contained a photograph and advertised an anti-British parade. These posters had already been torn down from billboards twice yesterday by Public Concession police officers without incident. When the posters were repeatedly put back up, Watterson decided to</p>
<p>go to the scene himself.</p>
<p>As soon as he tore down the posters, five "Great Way" police officers ordered Watterson into the police station. Watterson, knowing that resistance was futile, complied. The extent of Watterson's mistreatment was</p>
<p>not confirmed last night.</p>
<p>However, reporters saw Watterson last night looking as normal as usual and showing no signs of injury. When Watterson was</p>
<p>dragged into the police station,</p>
<p>his chauffeur telephoned the Bubbling Well Road police station, and a squad of police officers arrived. Shortly thereafter, Italian soldiers also arrived, and Watterson was immediately released. Italian officers and police officials will discuss the matter this morning (the 24th).</p>

<p>In the area under the jurisdiction of the Dixwell Road police station in Hongkew, adjacent to the extraterritorial area, a dozen or so Chinese again engaged in private, localized anti-British propaganda and posted slogans on the border at around 8 p.m. yesterday evening. At the time, the incident was witnessed by Mr. Wells, a British employee of the Public Works Department (工部局). He immediately reported it to the Dixwell Road police station, and a British police chief, Shih Tung (食同), went to stop them. However, the dozen or so Chinese paid no attention to him, resulting in another dispute. The "Great Way" (大道) fake "police station police" also happened to see the conflict between the two sides on the border area and immediately took all the people to the fake "police station." The police station received the news and reported it to the authorities. As of midnight, negotiations were still underway.</p>

<p>Recently, the French police suddenly received a tip-off that there was a secret prostitution establishment (commonly known as a high-end "salty meat shop") in a certain building on Route Massenet. The prostitutes there were all concubines of wealthy men, and the patrons were all from the automobile class. Ordinary people could never try it. It was said that the price per visit was at least 50 to 100 yuan, and even with that it was difficult to get a glimpse without being introduced by a regular customer. After receiving the report, the police chief sent detectives for secret investigation for over a month before confirming the truth. As a result, at around 9 p.m. the night before last, a large number of detectives and police were mobilized to surround the building from all sides and then rushed in together. Sure enough, as many as 12 concubines of wealthy merchants were arrested, and the madam, Zhang Li, was also arrested and taken to the police station. At the time, they were all fined in accordance with regulations and released.</p>

<p>Cai Degao, a 72-year-old Jiangxi native residing at No. 596 Route Pères Froc, French Concession, carried five gold ingots and four gold forks with a total value of 2,200 yuan with him at 9 a.m. on the 22nd. At the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lupan, he boarded French Business Route 7 tram, intending to deposit them in a friend's safe deposit box in Shantong Road. Unexpectedly, when the tram passed the Hualong Road stop, Cai realized that the gold ingots beside him had been stolen by pickpockets. He immediately got off the tram and reported it to the French police, requesting their arrest. Inspector Wang Rusong, detectives Gao Meihui and Ma Yizhi, and Detective Xu Jintang investigated and learned that the theft was committed by four Jiangbei natives, Lu Yanqun, You Shaofeng, Chen Jinsheng, and Xu Ruyou. After apprehending the thieves, they went to Room 315 of the Liang'an Apartments on Songshan Road to divide the loot. They then arrested the four suspects, Lu, You, Chen, and Xu, and recovered the original loot, with one gold ingot missing. Yesterday, they were handed over to the 8th Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 District Court, requesting detention for investigation and a rescheduled hearing. After Judge Qiu Huanhuan questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be detained pending further investigation and a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>Li Huanran from Anhui, Lin A'er (local), and Madam Wang Ma, a woman, specialized in luring and abducting young girls and selling them to other cities for profit, dividing the proceeds.

They sold them to institutions established by their accomplices in Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places, and then resold them to brothels where they would be made prostitutes when they reached a slightly older age. The case was uncovered, and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Huishi Police Station arrested them and handed them over to the First Special District Court.

At approximately 6 a.m. on the 23rd, he was arrested by Chinese police No. 926, along with 70 small packages of heroin, and taken to the Huishi Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was handed over to the First Special District Court, and the police lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested strict punishment. Judge Jiang sentenced Yuan to six years of imprisonment and confiscated the evidence.</p>

<p>After Tang Jiapeng, former manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was assassinated to death at midnight on June 18, 1933, the French police arrested the criminals Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi one after another. The case was handed over to the Special No. 2 District Court for prosecution. After three trials, the final judgment sentenced Zhao to life imprisonment and Zhang to 20 years of imprisonment. During the execution of the sentence, Zhao Guangfu reported to the French police that Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the Tianchan Theater, had instigated the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, and that he had</p>
<p>handed over a pistol at the Jiangnan Hotel on the original site of the Asia Hotel. Zhang Xiaosizi was listed as a witness. The French police dispatched detectives to arrest Gu Zhuxuan on September 10, 1935, and handed him over to the Special No. 2 District Court for prosecution in accordance with the law. The preliminary hearing was presided over by former Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu, who sentenced Gu Zhuxuan to 15 years of imprisonment for murder. Gu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court. The Criminal Court President, Zhu Huanbiao, ruled that Gu Zhuxuan was innocent. Because the French Police Department refused to accept it, it petitioned the Higher Third Branch Court Prosecutor to appeal to the Supreme Court. Subsequently, within the appeal period, Gu applied to the Higher Third Branch Court to stop his detention and</p>
<p>was allowed bail. It was ordered that Gu pay a 20,000 yuan surety for being on call. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and recognized that Gu was indeed guilty. It ruled to revoke the original judgment and return the case to the Higher Third Branch Court for further investigation and trial. The Higher Third Branch Court received the Supreme Court's judgment and case file and held a hearing in October 1937, summoning Gu to court for questioning. At that time, because</p>
<p>the key witnesses in the case, the informant Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Xiaosizi, had been transferred to the Second Prison in Beixinjing under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice. They had been taken to military agencies in the rear area after the outbreak of the war and could not be transferred to the case for questioning. The Higher Third Branch Court considered that the case could not proceed and reported it to the Ministry for verification, causing the case to be delayed for more than a year and unable to be concluded. Zhao Guangfu escaped to Shanghai after the war moved inland, and again joined the ranks of bandits. Recently, Zhao was arrested again in the Public Concession for</p>
<p>robbery and was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment by the First Special District Court. The Higher Third Branch Court learned of this and prepared a document yesterday morning to send several French police officers to the First Special District Court to transfer Zhao Guangfu to the case. The case of Gu Zhuxuan being sued for instigating murder will be tried soon. Wang Xinggao, who was also involved in the case, was arrested before Gu and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the first trial. He appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court and was acquitted at the same time as Gu Zhuxuan. During the appeal period, he also paid 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>surety and was released on bail. The French Police Department petitioned the Higher Third Branch Court Prosecutor to appeal to the Supreme Court, and the case was returned for retrial at the same time as Gu's case. Because Wang escaped on bail and could not be summoned to court, the court notified his guarantor that they could not surrender the person and ordered them to pay part of the bond. The guarantor was unable to pay, and the store was sealed and auctioned off. At the same time, an order was issued to arrest Wang Xinggao and bring him to justice for questioning.</p>

<p>Zheng Miaoying, daughter of Zheng Gu, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 11 Baoxing Lane, Rue du Consulat, is 16 years old and has a beautiful appearance. In July of last year, she invited Wang Peizhi (37 years old, Shandong native), residing at No. 4 Yiruli, Tiantong Road, to come to her house every day to teach Miaoying how to study Peking opera. Because Miaoying was naturally intelligent, she was able to perform on stage in about half a year. On the evening of December 2nd of the same year, Wang took Miaoying to the Tianchan Theater to practice her art. After the performance, Wang accompanied her home. On the way, he told the girl that her voice was not yet mellow and needed to be broken before she could sing high. The girl was then lured into his valley and was repeatedly raped, resulting in a hidden pregnancy. Her mother noticed that her abdomen was gradually growing larger, and she learned the truth after questioning her. She then reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to arrest Wang and transferred him to the Special No. 2 District Court for prosecution. It is now known that Judge Zhang has completed the trial of the case and announced the verdict yesterday: Wang Peizhi is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for raping a girl under the age of 16.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Re-mentioning "Humor" <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ren</p>
<p>Speaking of it, it already sounds like old news. A few years ago, we made a big commotion advocating for "humor," seemingly to the point where even eating and sleeping had to be done with a touch of "humor." However, the result, apart from translating a few quotes from George Bernard Shaw and re-copying a few sections from "Laughing Grove Records," left nothing behind.</p>
<p>At the time, some people opposed it, saying that "humor" couldn't be everywhere. They cited the story of Zilu tidying his hat strings before his death, believing that such "humor" was not something anyone could emulate. But this was still said by people who didn't understand "humor."</p>
<p>"Humor" is not a fly, which is absolutely correct. But the story of Zilu is really not an example of "humor." Our past "scholars" always had to declare their status at the time of death, like Zengzi's "changing mats," and the later ceremonies where many "loyal ministers" put on their court robes before sacrificing themselves, were all this kind of behavior. To regard such stories as "humor" would make "humor" seem like our domestic product, and eventually it would still become a fly. In reality, both those who advocate "humor" and those who oppose its advocacy are outsiders to "humor."</p>
<p>In any case, "humor" is not a product of this place. We have always emphasized "etiquette," unwilling to be proper but having to feign propriety, leaving no place to accommodate "humor." When we no longer talk about "etiquette," then a "Damn it!" can dismiss everything. To be more "refined," there is only the exposure of private scandals and petty jokes about taking advantage, which, though sometimes witty, are most suitable the more sickening they are. This is precisely the consequence that "etiquette" has bestowed upon us: the more we are bound by "etiquette" for a long time, the more we will move towards the "un-etiquette" side. This explains why we have never had "humor."</p>
<p>Because we don't have it, that's why we advocate it. The saying is correct, but the reality doesn't work. "Humor" arises in places with higher culture and more leisure. We might as well not talk about culture, but just with leisure, we first struggle to have this condition. Yet "humor" cannot be forced to look like it. And even if it looks like it, there are very few people who appreciate it. Most people are preoccupied with their hungry stomachs, where would they have the time to savor "humor"? It is inevitable that "humor" writers ultimately cannot be born among us, and that "humor" advocates ultimately have to cling to George Bernard Shaw and "Laughing Grove Records."</p>
<p>But does this mean that we have absolutely no shadow of "humor" before our eyes? Not quite. "Humor" still exists, but it is not advocated, nor is it deliberately acted out. Rather, it is when the person involved does things with a straight face, not thinking about "humor" at all, but precisely reveals a "humorous" style. But you need to know how to see it—that is, you need to know the way of seeing.</p>
<p>This kind of "humor" is exactly the opposite of deliberately made "humor." The more tense the times, the more of it there will be. The reason is that some upper-class people will be caught off guard by the rapid changes of the times, so there will be constant wonderful things happening. For example, when a certain professor advocated something unreasonable at a meeting, and was opposed by the entire room to the point of helplessness, he pointed to certain two characters on the plaque, saying that it was because he saw that plaque. For example, a writer always boasts of not caring about politics and not being affiliated with any party, but suddenly writes a large article in a certain publication, and when someone questions him, he says: "I have no politics or parties in my heart!"—If you pay attention to wonderful things like this, you can collect some. Who dares to say that these are not the highest standard of "humor"?</p>
<p>There are also larger things, such as Suzhou not allowing storytellers to tell "Conquest of the East," which not only exceeds the level of general "humor," but is really an unprecedented marvel. No matter how talented a "humor" master is, they have no ability to do it.</p>
<p>The central publication "The Analects," which once advocated "humor," can no longer be seen. However, the "Selected Works of Humor" published by "The Analects" Society still lie on old book stalls and are sold as waste paper. Seeing the book's exquisite binding and pristine white paper, one cannot help but feel pity. I don't know if those celebrities who once advocated "humor" still aspire to it. If they haven't lost heart, I think it's better to change things up, not talk about "literature," but discuss "events," and it would be more practical to compile two volumes of "Selected Humorous Events" of the past. This is not "anti-Japanese eight-legged essay," and it doesn't seem to greatly harm "spirituality." What do "humorists" think?</p>
<h3 id="e80">One Hundred Patriotic Ci Poems to the Tune of Man Jiang Hong <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Recently, I saw Li Zongye's "One Hundred Patriotic Ci Poems to the Tune of Man Jiang Hong," published by Commercial Press, one of the student's Chinese Studies Series, starting from Yue Fei, going through Zhang Xiaoxiang, Chen Liang, Liu Kezhuang, Xin Qiji, Liu Guo of the Southern Song Dynasty, Wen Tianxiang of the late Song Dynasty, Zhang Huangyan, Wu Yi, Qian Sule of the late Ming Dynasty, Qiu Jin, Liang Qichao of the late Qing Dynasty, and ending with modern people Hu Hanmin and Liu Yazi. It is both meaningful and very unique.</p>
<p>Because I liked this book, I had a silly urge and spent several days painstakingly flipping through one hundred kinds of "Famous Qing Ci," and found some that Li Zongye had not included:</p>
<p>(1) Dong Wukai of Wujin has a Cangwu Ci, a poem "Passing by Jinsha Temple and Respectfully Rhyming with the Original Poem Written on the Wall by Yue Ewang," which says: "Donning armor and throwing down spears, passing by the Xiao Temple, the morning bell has just stopped. Imagining that day, anger causing the hair to stand on end, with a heart full of loyalty and bravery. The sword's qi chills the Yangxian grass at night, the brush sweeps away the Jinsha moon. Brushing the broken stele, remaining regret faces West Lake, sharing the sorrow. ○ The shame of Huaibei, is difficult to wash away, the discussion of Huaixi, is difficult to extinguish. Sighing that Huanglong has not been drunk, the Ou still incomplete. The pool water sings in autumn with the words of famous scholars, icy tears sprinkle the blood of heroes. Look at the dense pine and cypress facing south branches, towards the twin towers." In addition, there is also a poem "Worshiping the Tomb of Yue Ewang Respectfully Rhyming with the Original Poem" and a "Worshiping the Tomb of Lord Zhongsu," which are not listed. (2) Zhao Huaiyu of Wujin's Qiulai Yin, the first poem is "Rhyming with the Tomb of Yue Ewang," which says: "Twelve golden tablets, the winds and waves started, the ambitious plan ended. Thousands of years later, I come to mourn, still with intense feelings. The northern cavalry does not neigh on the spring Long grass, the cuckoo still sings on the southern branches. Drinking with you lords in Huanglong, is my lifelong goal, the Northern Expedition, difficult to clear. Returning to the North Temple, the injustice is difficult to extinguish. Sighing that after the Great Wall is broken, the water is depleted and the mountains are incomplete. A three-foot Ma Jin Chi Mei statue, a handful of yellow earth, the blood of heroes. Seeing the bones of the Song family, remembering the evergreen, an empty mausoleum pass."</p>
<p>(3) Feng Dengfu of Jiaxing's Zhongyunxian Pavilion Ci has a poem "Inscribing the Statue of Qin Liangyu, the Heavenly Woman of Shizhu," which says: "Hundreds of battles for the rivers and mountains, how many are there with moth eyebrows and swallow foreheads? Supporting half the wall, the Madam's city is there, the wind and clouds formation is dark. White pole gold spears, the heavenly decree land, bright makeup iron cavalry, reporting to the heavenly day. Seeing the portrait painted first with a beautiful woman's picture, the bow shoes are narrow. ○ The Green Calf is hated, the Yunyang is in distress. The emerald sleeves are broken, the Zongzhou strategy. Thinking of the grand hair of Rong, the colors of the high platform. The king's tent talks about the Thai moon at night, the cotton robe is stained with the blood of the fierce river. Sighing for the national殇, the children are all heroes, crying through the orchid." (Honglan, Liangyu's daughter-in-law)</p>
<p>(4) Wang Peng of Lingui's Bantang Dinggao has a "Respectfully Writing the Ink After Yue Zhongwu Wang Gave General Wu's Precious Sword Line," which says: "Thunder and rain empty hall, the morning rushes to unroll, dragon and snake rise. Looking up to worship, gathering as if seeing, the sword light is full. The wish is so high, the mountains want to regret, the friendship is solemn, the cups complement each other. Thinking of the night shield ink dripping, singing and crying. ○ Darkly sounding qi, sad song. Thousands of times, cyclically read. Sighing that the king's sword can be borrowed, where can the shame be washed away! Sadly looking at the millennia, people cannot be seen, seeking a trail, the east is still covered. Asking who is it, wiping away tears and harmonizing sad songs? Yan Terrace built." There is also a poem "Visiting the Shrine of Yue Ewang in Zhuxian Town Respectfully Writing," which is not listed.</p>
<p>In Li's selection, the late Song Wen Xin Qiji and Liu Guo, etc., seem to be placed in reverse order. Also, in Dong Rong's note, it is said that Jiang Shiquan's "Guilin Frost" is a patriotic drama, but its meaning is not entirely the same as that of the same person's "Winter Green Tree," because what Guilin Frost writes is that the Han army inlaid red banner horse Xiong Zhen is loyal to Qing Kong, which is relatively secondary.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Dream of Banners and Flags <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>A group of people, emaciated by suffering, with radiant smiles on their faces, smiles hiding tears, forming a wall, with hearts of steel, a surging torrent. Unknowing children, reaching out, arbitrarily yet familiarly fiddling with the golden light of the cherry tassels on swords and spears, blinking in the warm, charming sun. Red tiger whiskers, floating on swords and spears, axes and halberds, exuding wisps of smiles. In the laughter, honey offerings are dedicated to millions of sincere hearts. Everyone completes a solemn and unwavering prayer. Years of excessive vigilance have reduced enjoyment and sleep. Blessings to the exiles at the ends of the earth, blessings to the iron-like warriors in these difficult times, their hearts have become emaciated. Years of cold in hell, they didn't believe there would be today, they would see the banners and flags of their dreams.</p>
<p>Is this a dream?</p>
<p>Excessive joy or sorrow often makes people wonder if this is not reality but a dream. Indeed, we love this dream too much, we love it, pursue it, grasp it, and don't let it escape from our hands. One day, the dream came. Clouds of joyous doubt paint the banners and flags with a layer of dusk, the color of dreams, hazy and subtle. We stubbornly paint joy with clouds of doubt. Carrying a pile of thick days and months, waiting, anxiety and hard thinking, outlining many bleak silhouettes of the morning moon, meeting again in old dreams, and encountering each other again at dawn, you should say this is a dream, is it realistic?</p>
<p>Thanks to my travel experiences, I have had several opportunities to enjoy the sweetness between this true dream. You have no reason to say this is a dream. But you are too excited. Joy is often accompanied by doubt. Although I don't like dreams, when I rushed to a desolate city wall, I saw a flag hanging on the flagpole, fluttering in the strong wind, swaying proudly, I did wonder if it was a dream. On a dilapidated small hill, a group of soldiers were cooking, and cooking smoke was rising. You should say this is not a dream? How wonderful the banners and flags, how beautiful the bugle calls. As for dreams, I know that is not it. The happiness is realistic, but alas, I have carried a pile of dreams of banners and flags, wading through too many long years. Coming from old dreams, and encountering each other again in reality. I think banners and flags are too lovely. I would like to have a wonderful enjoyment. Let the hands in the dream touch the yak tails in surprise, blessing the reunion, blessing the exiles, and also blessing the returning fighters. I should say with surprise and admiration: "It is our banners and flags after we parted!"</p>
<p>Oh, we should bless the reunited group of people, for a flag pole, many people have buried their bright red hearts, in the soil, cultivating flowers of freedom. Stepping over flesh and blood and corpses, stubbornly and fiercely planting their foremost banners and flags. There are many people who, when isolated and helpless, let their hurried breathing accompany them, keeping watch over the banners and flags. Everyone has a dream of banners and flags. Young enthusiasts trek through mountains and rivers, to find their love, letting the wind and sand age their years. Those who are isolated on "insulation islands," to find their love, have repeatedly suffered misfortune and insult, entangled in kudzu vines. Those who are frozen in hell deliver their bitterness, those who travel through difficult journeys also tell of their hardships and emaciation. Banners and flags are covered with tears, coming from dreams, carrying a pile of thick days and months, full of waiting, anxiety and hard thinking, and I have encountered each other again in reality.</p>
<p>I remember very clearly coming from the dream, my face still bearing the breathlessness of pursuit and the tension of competition. We have seen the banners and flags after our parting again. You should say how beautiful this is. There are no tears, no sorrow, only radiance and laughter. Although he is somewhat emaciated, he is also more mature, and one disaster has made him more vigorous.</p>
<p>In schools, in city streets, in squares, on the river surface, in the windy and grassy borderlands, in the southern country where red beans grow, on the boundless seaside, at the source of high mountains and great rivers, covering the vast fields like a yurt, we can see familiar banners and flags everywhere.</p>
<p>Thank you for this happy reunion. I bless a group of people, blessing those who pursue and seize those banners and flags.</p>
<p>"These are our banners and flags after we parted!"</p>

<h3 id="e83">Red Devil Vasika <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>They looked at him calmly, very seriously, but it was difficult to fathom what they really thought of Vasika from their eyes. Ajiusnia, helping the procuress, helped him put on his coat; all the girls were in the kitchen, wearing melancholic, astringent faces, silent.</p>
<p>"Goodbye!" Vasika immediately lowered his head, not looking at the girls' faces, saying, "Good...bye!"</p>
<p>Several of them silently nodded and said goodbye to him, but he didn't see this. But Lida said softly:</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Vasily Milonovich, goodbye... goodbye..."</p>
<p>The doctor's assistant and the yard man held Vasika under his armpits, helped him up from the bench, and took him outside. But he turned his head again to say goodbye to the girls:</p>
<p>"Goodbye... I... really—what do..."</p>
<p>Another two or three people responded:</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Vasily..."</p>
<p>"No need to worry about anything!" He shook his head, his face showing an expression completely unlike his usual one.</p>
<p>"Goodbye! For the sake of Christ's face... his... that..."</p>
<p>"Taken away! He's a good man..." Ajiusnia fell on the bench, sobbing sadly.</p>
<p>Vasika shivered, raised his head, his eyes shining strangely. He listened very carefully to the sobbing, stopped, and said softly with trembling lips:</p>
<p>"Really, stupid woman! What a stupid woman!"</p>
<p>"Let's go! Let's go!" The doctor's assistant frowned, urging.</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Ajiusnia! Please come to the hospital..." Vasika said loudly.</p>
<p>But Ajiusnia continued to sob.</p>
<p>"Why did you leave me?"</p>
<p>The girls surrounded her, looking at her face and the tears flowing from her eyes.</p>
<p>Lida leaned over her, roughly comforting her:</p>
<p>"Ah? What are you sad about! He won't die! Yes, go to him, ... yes, you can go tomorrow..." (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e84">How Strange is the So-Called "Theory of Chinese Medical Art" (3) <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Song Daren</p>
<p>Experience Cannot Be Relied Upon</p>
<p>Mr. Ding said: The achievements of Chinese medicine rely on experience, and Mr. Zhang also said that Chinese medicine had its experience long before the emergence of Yin-Yang theory, as if experience is very valuable; but experience—not scientific experimentation—is just the discovery of human instincts. All civilized and uncivilized peoples, even general animals, possess this kind of experience, which is not a value specially advocated by Chinese medicine. Moreover, experience is something that cannot be relied upon. Mr. Ding gave the example of old fishermen at sea and archers, saying: "Almost every old fisherman at sea can warn in advance when there will be a strong wind, big wave, or rainstorm, and astronomers also issue the same warning, and the results obtained are the same," and also said: "We can easily see in books that there are archers who can hit the target every time—does that mean that everyone who practices can hit the target every time? Also not possible, ... we understand very well that the accuracy of modern artillery shooting, ... does that mean that everyone who practices can shoot accurately, it is possible, why is it possible, because the accuracy of artillery is based on instruments, the instruments calculate the angle accurately, and the shooting will definitely be accurate," and so on. Then, now that astronomers have predictions for weather changes, reporting them a few days in advance, without the slightest error; the range of artillery can be measured using precise geometric trigonometry, naturally hitting the target every time. Why should we abandon the gifts bestowed by scientists—scientific tools—and desperately yearn for this kind of unreliable experience, stubbornly refusing to wake up? You must know that science is a principle that everyone can learn and master, but this kind of experience can only be obtained when one is "old," and it is not necessarily accurate. Let me give a few examples of "experience not matching the facts," I am afraid that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Ding will have to admit it after reading it!</p>
<p>According to Aristotle's principles, the rate at which all objects fall depends on the weight, with heavier objects falling faster, and our experience tells us the same, which no one has ever denied; but Galileo's experiment proved it to be incorrect. One day, in front of the entire school and the citizens, he ran to the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, carrying two iron balls, one weighing one pound and the other weighing one hundred pounds; he put the two balls in a box, turned the box over, causing the two balls to fall simultaneously, but saw the two balls falling side by side, finally landing on the ground at the same time with a clang, thus the ancient legend was proven to be completely wrong. In fact, the rate at which an object falls depends on its resistance to air resistance.</p>
<p>Also, ancient astronomers, after seeing the phenomenon of "the sun rising in the east and setting in the west," experienced a theory of "heaven moving and earth being still," which is absolutely true and has never been doubted for thousands of years, but it is completely reversing the facts, a preposterous nonsense, becoming a great joke in the history of Chinese astronomy.</p>
<p>Whether this kind of experience is correct or not is not very important anyway because it has nothing to do with the human body. Here I want to talk about the human body experience of Chinese medicine: for example, like wet eczema, almost every Chinese medicine doctor or ordinary patient knows that its cause is dampness, everyone says the same thing, without any difference, so there is no reason to be wrong. Their basis is that when the disease occurs, this eczema no longer itches. It was originally damp, but now it has become not damp, then it must be that dampness is hidden inside causing trouble. This is pure experience, which everyone believes in without doubt—alas! even now there are still people who believe in it—but the fact is not so, generally speaking, stubborn skin diseases have been parasitic in the human body for a long time, and their itching and secretion have become equal to normal phenomena. If other diseases are contracted, and the cells are affected by other causes, the itching and secretion work stops, which really has nothing to do with whether it is damp or not; therefore, only based on the phenomena of the disease, using a cursory and superficial observation, to determine that it is damp causing trouble, this fallacy of reversed cause and effect is really not to be taken as a lesson.</p>
<p>There are various causes of abdominal pain, some originate from cancer and ulcers in various parts of the stomach and intestines, as well as gallstones, liver diseases, or various parasitic diseases, definitely not any liver qi, stomach qi, cold pain, heat pain, this kind of unfounded speculation, catching shadows, can arbitrarily determine right and wrong. In the past, I don't know how many healthy organs have been wronged under the fingers of the magically powerful Chinese medicine doctors; but the real lesion is casually let go, allowing it to spread and grow until it is beyond recovery. This artistic experience (?) is really absolutely unacceptable. If they could use their artistic experience to accurately point out the location of the patient's lesion and its pathological form, or could identify which kind of bacteria or protozoa is causing the trouble; then how could scientific new medicine not be sincerely convinced and willingly admit defeat, it is just a pity that Chinese medicine does not have such great art that shocks the heavens and makes the ghosts cry, I am afraid that even if they experience for thousands of years or tens of thousands of years, they will definitely not be able to experience it, what can be done about this?</p>

<h3 id="e85">A Brief Discussion of Food Poisoning <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Shibin</p>
<p>Any edible substance that, upon consumption, causes poisoning is collectively known as food poisoning. Briefly distinguishing them, they contain the following three minor different meanings:</p>
<p>(1) The food itself has already deteriorated, and poisoning occurs after eating it.</p>
<p>(2) The food itself has no changes, but it contains substances that can cause poisoning.</p>
<p>(3) The food is normal and has no changes, and it is of good quality, but the eater has a peculiar constitution that causes poisoning from this food.</p>
<p>The first situation is the most common type of food poisoning. We can often see it in newspapers. Seafood is undoubtedly the most common poisoned food. Because the seafood we usually buy in the market is dead rather than alive, we must pay close attention to the length of time after death. Although some seafood can be distinguished by its discoloration and fishy odor, it is not difficult to identify, but it is very easy to be deceived by the vendors' skillful exaggeration or the buyers' desire for cheapness. In short, seafood that can be used as food for us will inevitably undergo some degree of deterioration after a considerable period of time after death. Even if it is stored in a cold storage room, it will only slow down the change. Eating this deteriorated food often causes symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, belching, and even vomiting, headache, dizziness, and facial flushing. However, this type of poisoning often occurs in a family or a group, but the onset varies in speed, and the symptoms vary in severity. It is rare for it to only occur in one person. This type of poisoning is easily known by people.</p>
<p>In the second case of poisoning, the food is often mixed with special substances, and intentional placement constitutes a violation of criminal law, which can be heard and seen in society from time to time. Conversely, unintentional poisoning is most often related to food containers or cooking utensils. For example, using copper pots can introduce mineral poisons into the food, or the container may contain poisons, and one may accidentally put food into it. In addition, rats or cockroaches may gnaw on food and spread poisonous bacteria on top of it, which also happens from time to time. It was once heard that in a certain factory, in the morning of summer, seven-tenths of the workers suffered from vomiting and diarrhea, as well as headaches, so the whole factory was in an uproar, and it was suspected that the food eaten last night contained poisonous substances, so the kitchen was carefully inspected. One side questioned the workers with milder poisoning, only to find out that several workers had secretly brought chickens into the factory to cook last night, and added burdock, and did not use chopsticks when stirring, but used several copper wires bent to replace them. After chemical examination, it was proved that it was caused by copper salt poisoning. In this type of poisoning, the eater is often unaware of it, and it comes from the deliberate or unintentional actions of one party.</p>
<p>For the third type of so-called peculiar constitution, there are many examples. For example, after eating certain foods, some people feel itchy all over, or after eating certain foods, their faces and ears turn red as if they were drunk, or they feel nauseous, dizzy, abdominal pain, diarrhea, etc., and some even faint suddenly. The strangest thing is that a certain athlete, who is tall and strong, cannot eat shrimp. Even if he eats a little, he feels severe headache and dizziness and faints suddenly. After a while, he vomits and has diarrhea. It takes about half a day to recover, but the degree of allergy will definitely increase afterward. Even adding shrimp to the soup and drinking it will cause the same poisoning. Most of this type of poisoning is known and can be prevented. For this poisoning, it is better to regard it as a special reaction of the liquid in one's own body to the protein of shrimp, rather than considering it mental.</p>
<p>For the above-mentioned causes of food poisoning, the first and second items must be treated by a doctor as soon as possible, otherwise it will endanger life. The third item only requires you to be careful at all times to avoid it.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Stomach Ailments (4) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Weizhong</p>
<p>Second is vomiting. One-third of patients with peptic ulcer have this symptom, not everyone. Vomiting usually occurs when in pain. If vomiting occurs immediately after eating, the vomit will naturally not have changed much, but if it takes a little longer, the vomit will be acidic chyme. This type of vomit is most harmful to the teeth. Generally, if the ulcer is in the cardia of the stomach entrance, vomiting occurs immediately after eating. If it is in the pylorus of the stomach outlet, vomiting occurs two or three hours after eating.</p>
<p>Third is gastric bleeding, which is due to the erosion of blood vessels by the ulcer. The eroded blood vessels are large and small, so there is more or less bleeding. When there is a lot of bleeding, hematemesis and melena are seen. The author has seen many people die from blood loss due to heavy bleeding. If the amount of bleeding is very small, it is not visible on the surface. Only chemical methods can be used to check whether there are blood components in the stool, which is called occult bleeding. Hematemesis may not have a cause to look for, it comes suddenly, or it is induced by physical or mental labor or overeating. Usually, there is severe stomach pain before hematemesis. Part of the blood often migrates to the intestines, so the stool is black.</p>
<p>The difference between gastric bleeding and pulmonary hemorrhage is what most people are eager to know, so I will write a little about it: The blood from hematemesis (gastric bleeding) is discharged with vomiting. When it coagulates, it does not contain air, it is dark red, the reaction is acidic, and it contains food components. It occurs suddenly, the duration is short, and there is a feeling of belching and pressure in the upper abdomen. Few people have a rise in body temperature, and the stool is black. The blood from hemoptysis (pulmonary hemorrhage) is coughed up with coughing. When it coagulates, it contains air, the blood is bright red, the reaction is alkaline, and it is mixed with mucus and pus. The duration is long, and there is a feeling of heaviness, pain, or rising temperature in the chest. It is mostly feverish. In addition, it should be noted that if it is originally pulmonary hemorrhage or bleeding from the mouth, nose, pharynx, or throat, part of the blood is swallowed into the stomach and vomited out again, it is easy to be confused with gastric bleeding.</p>
<p>Fourth is hyperacidity, that is, excessive stomach acid.</p>
<p>In addition, patients often complain of acid reflux, heartburn, thirst, and erratic appetite, sometimes even increased appetite, but when a severe pain occurs, they reduce their food intake for fear of eating.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Pay Cash for Consultation Fees <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Since foreign exchange has tightened and drug prices have soared, drug merchants who hoard drugs have made no small profit of ten times. Doctors buy drugs and refuse to keep accounts, and must pay in cash. The drug merchants' self-seeking can be said to be detailed and thorough, but it has a significant impact on the doctors' side. Patients often get used to keeping accounts and settle at the end of the month. According to the current situation, they must pay in cash for the pharmacy, but they cannot collect in cash for the patients. The burden of bearing the advance payment will make the turnover difficult. The Doctors' Association of this city, in view of this, specially announces to the patients that they are requested to pay in cash from now on. It is hoped that the patients will understand this difficulty, sympathize with it, and cooperate with it.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Finance: Fluctuations and Instability in British and American Exchange Rates <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Tight at First, Then Loosening</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices showed no change. The British and American markets were quite tortuous in the dark market, with fluctuating and unstable conditions. The morning market opened with a hard trend, with British exchange at four shillings six and a quarter, and American exchange at nine yuan, but no transactions were heard. After the opening, the banking sector suddenly came to grab fiercely, causing foreign firms and speculators to also start activities. Moreover, there was a temporary lack of maintenance, so it was a momentary state. British gold actually shrank to four shillings one and seven-eighths, and American exchange also softened to eight yuan twenty-five. After 9:30, because the market's exchange bill discount was high, reaching 270 yuan, it was even more difficult to obtain cash. Therefore, the grabbing wind was slightly restrained. In addition, the Bombay Silver Company and the Chinese yarn and flower gangs competed to throw and sell, and the Western merchant Sassoon also strongly sold futures, causing the market to turn back hard. After entering, the Hong Kong Electric also suddenly came to supply and sell, so the potential became more stable, and the results were slightly longer. It was also heard that some people sold spot goods and bought August, calculating that the discount given to arbitrageurs was 9.275 US dollars, and the combined monthly interest excluding commission reached about nine and a half cents. Transactions were still旺. The bank's selling price of Hong Kong exchange was 31 and a half yuan.</p>

British loosened 0.09375 and American hardened 0.1875. After the opening, Japanese banks and foreign firms competed fiercely to grab, and Chinese speculators also started activities.

Subsequently, speculators settled in a certain bank's spot British gold, which actually softened to 4 shillings 1.1875. Later, Japanese banks and foreign firms also successively grabbed American bank's spot American exchange for only 8 yuan 25. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes. After the silver balance tax was announced and remained exempt, the Bombay Silver Company suddenly came to sell fiercely, and the Chinese yarn and flower gangs continued to sell, and the Western merchant Sassoon also strongly sold the British and American exchanges for July and August futures. Therefore, the situation turned back hard. It is estimated that a certain bank sold this month's American exchange to Chase for 8 yuan 1.1875. At that time, the Bombay Silver Company and the yarn and flower gangs competed to sell spot British gold to the Bank of England, which rose from 4 shillings 3125 to half a shilling. Then, they sold spot American exchange to the American bank, which hardened from 8 yuan 4.4375 to 75. The Western merchant Sassoon sold this month's British gold to the Bank of England and the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger for 4 shillings 375, and August's British gold for 4 shillings 0.0625. At the same time, he sold August's American exchange to a certain bank for 7 yuan 875. Near noon, the Bank of England mutually made spot British gold for 4 shillings 4.4375. At that time, there were some swap transactions. It is estimated that the Bank of England sold spot goods and bought August, calculating that the discount given to arbitrageurs was 9.375 US dollars, and the combined monthly interest (excluding commission) was strongly 9.5 cents. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4 shillings, calling 6875 for British gold and 8 yuan 6875 for American exchange.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Also Sold in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Although the Japanese bank came to grab and settle slightly in the afternoon, the yarn and flower gangs came to sell. In addition, Hong Kong Electric also suddenly came to sell fiercely, and the market continued to see a return to hard. It is estimated that the yarn and flower gangs and Hong Kong Electric successively sold spot British gold to Japanese banks and foreign firms, which rose from 4 shillings to 5.53125. Then, they sold spot American exchange to foreign firms and foreign banks, which hardened from 8 yuan 75 to 875.

<p>Yesterday's cash raw red dark market conditions: because foreign exchange was still quite tortuous, the market situation also changed violently. At the beginning, it was rising, and then it fell sharply. The difference between the high and low prices was also as much as 330 yuan. At the beginning, it was heard that foreign exchange had been fiercely grabbed by Japanese banks, and it suddenly became extremely tight. It was also heard that banks were reluctant to supply British gold above 4 shillings 25. Therefore, the general public thought that the exchange market would shrink violently again, and they felt panic and raised prices by releasing盘s to each other. It is said that a certain silver building (on behalf of the wealthy) and a certain silver firm (on behalf of foreign firms) raised prices even more fiercely. In addition, sellers disappeared, so the morning opening soared to 3,830 yuan, which was the highest peak of the day. Later, because foreign exchange suddenly turned loose and hard, it aroused the selling wind. Silver building gangs and cash houses took advantage of the high price to sell ahead of each other. The market situation suddenly turned against them and poured down to the low盘 of 3,500 yuan. Later, because the wealthy came to absorb at low prices again, the situation turned stable. The noon closing was still standing at 3,600 yuan. In the afternoon, because foreign exchange returned hard, the price of gold also fell again to 3,510 yuan. As a result, it closed at 3,530 yuan, which was a涨 of 60 yuan compared to the previous weekend. Transactions were still旺at more than 2,000 taels. The price of silver building ornaments also rose sharply first and then stepped back. The larger firms once hung up 400 yuan, and finally hung up 10 yuan.

<p>Raw Red Re-涨 Sixty Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each条 (ten taels), at the beginning, because it was heard that foreign exchange was extremely tight, people's hearts were abnormally firm and昂. Buyers released盘s to purchase. It is said that a certain silver firm raised prices more and more fiercely. For a time, sellers disappeared. At 9:25, the market opened, which was a huge 涨 of 360 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. A certain silver firm entered金号 twenty taels, the price was 3,830 yuan. After the opening, although a certain silver firm and a certain money exchange industry absorbed each other, the foreign exchange suddenly tightened and returned to loosen, so it aroused the selling wind. Silver building gangs and cash houses competed to sell, and the situation turned against them and poured down. They broke through the three hundred-yuan barriers from 3,800 yuan to 600 yuan in succession, almost breaking into the 3,500 yuan关口. At present, Yu号 sells fifty taels to the money exchange industry, the price of 3,500 yuan is the lowest盘 of the day. Later, because a part of the silver building gang suddenly came to make up, and foreign exchange did not report continued hard, so散户 who had sold short that day also came to make up, so the market situation re-trended upward and flew up by more than 100 yuan. Money exchange industry mutually made fifty taels, the price was 3,630 yuan. Near noon, the money exchange industry continued to sell, and the price was pressed down by 40 yuan.

Silver building gang entered fifty taels from the cash house, the price was 3,595 yuan. At that time, it was heard that foreign exchange continued to report a return to hard, and people's hearts were虚疲. Cash houses and money exchange industries competed to sell out, and the price poured down 85 yuan. Money exchange industry sold ten taels to the silver building gang, the price was 3,510 yuan. At that time, there were many buyers at the price limit of 3,500 yuan, so the slightly seen return to high silver building brought in fifty taels from the money exchange industry, the price of 3,530 yuan was the evening closing price. As a result, it 涨 60 yuan compared to the noon closing on the previous Saturday. The total daily fluctuation was 330 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange bills continued to rise, but on that day, it was high first and then slightly returned. Every thousand yuan was once raised to the highest price of 270 yuan by those who urgently needed cash. Then it gradually returned low, to about 250 yuan at noon.

<h3 id="e93">Outlying Place Name Banknotes Should Still Be Used in Unity <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Since this city stopped using North China place name banknotes, recently, the 中交 two banks have specially set up exchange offices for零星 numbers of Tianjin and other place name banknotes below 10 yuan, and still allow exchange. However, the restrictions are extremely strict and crowded. As for outlying place name banknotes other than North China place names, such as Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other place name banknotes, although reports state that they can still be used, most merchants and banks refuse to accept them. Part of them were previously issued by commercial banks, such as 中南, Zhejiang Xingye, and China Reclamation (the above three banks' cash and guarantee reserves have been handed over to the receiving bank for counting), and Siming, China General Chamber of Commerce, China Industrial and other bank banknotes have been received. However, if the receiving bank exchanges outlying place name banknotes issued by these banks, it is rejected. If they are exchanged at the original issuing bank, they say that the reserve fund has been handed over to the receiving bank and has nothing to do with the bank. Such negotiations often occur, making it impossible for the banknote holders to exchange them, and they are likely to become waste paper. It is hoped that the receiving bank should publish an announcement stating that, in addition to North China and Hankou place names, all outlying place name banknotes, whether issued by the bank or the commercial bank banknotes received, should still be used in unity, and上海 place name legal tender can be exchanged at any time, and send a letter to the silver and money industry associations, requesting them to notify all banks to accept and use them, so as not to hinder the circulation of legal tender and maintain the confidence of the banknote holders. Now I will list the names of the receiving banks for the reserve funds of the eight commercial issuing banks as stipulated by the Issuing Reserve Committee.</p>

<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city has revised the exchange bill interest, which has been implemented since yesterday (the 24th), which is four points higher than the 17th. As for the public loan拆款 interest and the acceptance bill discount rate, they have not moved. The following is the exchange bill interest market:</p>
<p>Interest for drawing exchange bills with fellow banks 2角5分</p>
<p>Interest for depositing exchange bills with fellow banks 2角</p>
<p>(Calculated per thousand兀 per day)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Securities: Domestic Debt Falls Again <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's dark market for securities rose and fell quite quickly, rising slightly at first and then later, and finally still slightly weak. The trend showed signs of stability. A financial magnate informed the reporter yesterday that the decision to pay both principal and interest had been made and would still be handled in the same way as before, but it would be paid by exchange bill. The rumors about discounted interest may be different. The date of interest payment is not far away, so let's wait for confirmation. In terms of the environment, the financial situation has improved after the banking industry has made every effort to maintain it. However, the Sino-Japanese negotiations have a relationship with the future of China's resistance war. Although the specific situation cannot be predicted, people's hearts are still uneasy. Therefore, the market fluctuates faster with the different psychology of each person. Yesterday's general situation was that small banks and money houses had a slight tendency to sell goods to seek cash. For example, Tiansheng Lianhe sold more, followed by No. 18, 41, and 64, which all sold. Tongyu also provided a slight amount. Therefore, the opening was slightly lower by about one yuan. Category C continued to be slightly lower to 0.07角, which was 2 yuan 34角 lower than the previous week. Later, short sellers took advantage of the small to make up, such as Hongkang, Tongkang, Xieda, Songmao, Dingkang, and Hengfu, which all bought in. The market price suddenly returned to good by 78角 to more than one yuan. Finally, scattered户s slightly sold out, and it fell back slightly by 23角. The market price fluctuated and was unpredictable, changing several times a day. As a result, it fell back slightly by 1 yuan 6角半 to 2 yuan. However, because Category D did not open on Saturday, it was only slightly lower by 1角 compared to before. Both Categories C and D also found new low prices. The total number of transactions was estimated to be about 700,000 yuan. The following is a summary table:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing 比前日</p>
<p>Unified A 0.7049.50 50.40 Down 1.65</p>
<p>Unified B 4.0041.90 42.10 Again 1.90</p>
<p>Unified C 42.0040.70 41.15 Again 1.85</p>
<p>Unified D 40.2540.20 40.10 Again 0.10</p>
<p>Unified E 41.8040.70 40.85 Again 2.00</p>
<p>Stock trading mostly had a market but no transactions. For example, the selling price of Chinese Electric shares was 5 yuan 6角, and the selling price of Zhejiang Xingye Bank shares was 65 yuan. None of them were traded because the涨风 of foreign exchange and raw red has been too strong in recent days, and most people have no time for this.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association reported that yesterday's delivery was quite large and ended early. There were no special highlights in the stock market. Yihang shares and Kaiping shares rose slightly, but most other stocks did not change much. The rubber stock market was firm, and most stocks were in demand. However, stocks such as Botu Annan, Lipai, and Ximenbu were all neglected. If a Sino-Japanese compromise can be achieved, it should enable the stock market to have good progress and the foreign exchange market can also be firm. If the two are uncertain, investors will hold back and be wary.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Cotton Yarn: Sales to Customers Decrease, Yarn Prices Still Rise; Double Horse and Shepherd Brands Rise Again by Ten Dollars <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is showing signs of recovery, but customer sales have significantly decreased. Aside from some purchases by traders from South China and Hong Kong, the volume is minimal, only 230 bales. Other traders have shown little activity. The general sentiment among yarn dealers is bullish. The exchange rate premium for banknotes is extraordinarily high, reportedly reaching 270 yuan, which has slightly suppressed market activity. In the afternoon, it was heard that the exchange rate for drafts has increased again.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, the market opened this morning with a consensus that prices were likely to rebound due to the significant drop in the previous day. This, combined with the contraction of foreign exchange and a slight rise in gold prices, spurred renewed interest. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn from foreign godowns was 545 yuan, and the godown warrant price was 533 yuan. Shortly after, the aforementioned news was confirmed, and buyers rushed in, causing prices to surge suddenly. The situation became more tense, with prices jumping by ten yuan. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn from foreign godowns reached 555 yuan, and the godown warrant price was 545 yuan. However, actual sales were weak. Later, it was heard that the British exchange rate had contracted, leading to another price increase. The highest price for Double Horse spot goods initially reached 561 yuan. Subsequently, due to a sharp increase in exchange surcharges and unfavorable news, prices retreated again. By the closing price, 20-count Double Horse yarn was at 556 yuan, and the godown warrant price was 543 yuan. The total trading volume for the half-day was only 710 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by eleven yuan, and Shepherd brand yarn rose by ten yuan. The Yong An Factory offered 40 bales of 20-count Special Golden City yarn at 610 yuan, available immediately. Today, 455 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 600 bales to Beihai, 500 bales to Haiphong, 130 bales to Yantai, and 120 bales to Tianjin. Yesterday, 2,250 bales of cotton yarn arrived from Tianjin. The amount purchased by various traders is listed below:</p>
<p>Fellow traders: 480</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 230</p>
<p>Total: 710</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market opened with rising prices, followed by a sharp increase in exchange surcharges, reaching a high of 270 yuan. The yarn, mainly sold for cash, was inevitably affected. Combined with sluggish customer sales, the asking price for 20-count Yueqin yarn was 414 yuan. However, with the brisk trade in Piqiu yarn for the next month, market prices are expected to be high.</p>
<h3 id="e97">U.S. Cotton Export Subsidy: Temporarily Set at 1.5 Cents per Pound <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton prices, the New York cotton market was relatively quiet yesterday. The opening price dropped slightly by 2-3 points due to short selling by Southern traders. Dealers generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting the government's announcement of the U.S. cotton export subsidy terms. Later, prices rose slightly due to favorable news from Liverpool and Bombay, and strong support from the banking sector. The closing price was better by 1-2 points. Indian cotton fell by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton remained closed.</p>
<p>Regarding foreign cotton trading in Shanghai, the detailed rules for the U.S. government's export subsidy were announced yesterday after the close of the New York market. The subsidy has been increased to 1.5 cents per pound. However, to ensure the success of this plan, Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace has the authority to increase or decrease the subsidy at any time. The subsidy terms will be effective from midnight on the 27th of this month to June 30th of next year. According to Wallace, it is estimated that U.S. cotton exports for this year will reach 3.4 million bales by the end of this month. This is the smallest figure for U.S. cotton exports in 60 years. He hopes that with the implementation of this subsidy, exports can increase to 6 million or 7 million bales next year. Local manufacturers were pleased to hear about the implementation of the subsidy. However, the inability to extend exchange rates and the lack of financial easing mean they can only wait and see. Large quantities of foreign cotton have arrived recently. The "Levrubank," carrying several tens of thousands of bales of Brazilian cotton, is scheduled to arrive today and dock at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong.</p>
<p>Spot cotton trading saw some transactions, but factory demand remained limited. In reality, the discount rate for legal tender is rising daily, and with tight credit conditions, there is little hope for business development. However, occasional deals are made among traders, but the quantities are small, so market prices have not fluctuated much. Regarding sources from northern Jiangsu, there were 286 bales of Tongzhou cotton. Exports included 250 bales of cotton to Hong Kong. The current cotton situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Bailuo cotton: 100.0 - 102.00, 200 bales</p>
<p>Traded for cash with godown delivery among traders.</p>
<p>Tongzhou cotton: 20.00, plus 10 bales</p>
<p>Traded with exchange settlement for godown delivery.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Piece Goods: Textile Mills Dare Not Accept Forward Orders; Exchange Sales Prices Increase <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market turned stable. Various parties uniformly expect higher prices for forward contracts, and mills are unwilling to accept them. Spot trading remains active. Cash prices remain unchanged, while exchange prices are affected by the premium, rising by an additional 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. Dyeing costs have increased by about 50%, so dyeing cloth prices have also risen slightly. Speculators traded over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and dyed cloth. Traders from Yantai on the northern route bought over 100 pieces of heavy coarse cloth from Dasheng and Yihua. Guangdong traders bought over 40 bales of fine twill from brands like Ai Zi. Local dyeing factories bought one thousand several hundred double bolts of colored twill and gray cloth, mostly for dyeing and sale to Guangdong traders. Orders from local traders are nearing completion by the end of the month, and deliveries are becoming increasingly busy.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth:</p>
<p>White cloth is affected by high cash premiums, resulting in sluggish sales. Sales prices continue to soften. Spot prices for Longtou fine cloth remain at only 14.25 to 14.3 yuan. However, forward contracts are popular among traders, with next month's goods trading at 15 yuan per piece. Yanghe fine cloth was traded among dealers at 14 yuan. Japanese trading houses offered 14.1 yuan, but fine twill was consistently weak, with prices falling by about 1 jiao per piece.</p>
<p>Exports:</p>
<p>Piece goods exports on the 25th: 46 pieces to Tianjin, 200 pieces to Yantai, 45 pieces to Hong Kong, 8 pieces to Beihai, and 50 pieces to Haiphong. In addition, 155 pieces arrived from Hong Kong on the 24th, and 740 pieces arrived from Tianjin.</p>

<p>The local silk market sees strong interest from British, French, and American trading houses. However, because the exchange rate is more stable than before, silk prices have not risen sharply despite brisk trading. Filature B-grade silk, 78%, sold for 3,000 yuan, all being Tin silk. Local manufacturers are aiming for even higher prices. Yesterday, Renchang, Baiduo, Renji, and other firms purchased a total of 60 dan. Zhejiang silk from six firms, with Qilin and Running Horse grades, are being actively purchased for export. Yesterday, Xinfu, Dachang, and others traded 150 dan at a price of 1,700 yuan, an increase of 500 yuan compared to ten days ago. For B-grade silk, the increase is 800 yuan.</p>
<p>In overseas silk markets, New York was closed on Sunday. Yokohama spot prices were 1,268 yuan, the current month was 1,241 yuan, and the forward December price was 1,170 yuan, up 2 to 8 yuan from last Saturday.</p>
<p>One bale of rayon arrived from Tianjin yesterday.</p>

<p>Needle-shaped eyebrow green tea sales are becoming more active due to the still low prices. Prices have rebounded from 60 yuan to 67-68 yuan. Baochang, Xiehe, and other firms have also slightly increased their purchases of premium grade eyebrow tea. The selling price for premium grade tea is 320 to 345 yuan, and the selling price for standard eyebrow tea is 275-276 yuan. Most merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach due to extremely tight credit conditions and high risks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 196 packages of tea arrived from Hong Kong, and 15 boxes were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Grains: Rice Merchants Hoarding, Leading to Scarcity <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Rice: After a period of rapid price increases, all goods have been capped at the limit price. Yesterday, sentiment became even more bullish, with both traders and customers seeking to buy. Local stores also had very high demand. However, at the same time, suppliers, believing that market prices could not rise further, were unwilling to sell and did not display samples. The market only saw early and late rice from the riverbanks, as well as general Huangsu japonica rice and aged customer glutinous rice. The situation was chaotic, and prices were all at the limit price. Therefore, trading in the market appeared quiet. There were rumors that those urgently needing rice were privately making deals above the limit price due to a lack of supply. However, these deals were extremely secretive, making it impossible to confirm. Given this situation, the upward trend in the rice market, despite the strict price limits imposed by the British and French authorities, may be difficult to contain. Wuxi Huangsu japonica rice was traded at 20 yuan, Yangjian at 20 yuan, Dujian at 19.5 yuan, aged customer glutinous rice at 16 yuan, and Zhajian at 15.6 yuan. Variable glutinous rice also followed the trend, with the price of foreign glutinous rice surging to 21.5 yuan. A total of 1,400 to 1,500 bags of goods from Songjiang Nangang, including Che Lun Bao Zi, arrived via the river.</p>
<p>Customer Indica Rice: Yesterday, although sales to inland areas decreased, local stores and speculators were even greedier. Total trading volume reached approximately 5,000 bags. Unpolished and medium-grade machine-milled indica rice increased by another 4-5 jiao, while medium-grade machine-milled indica rice was also quoted at the limit price of 16 yuan. High-quality Wuhu indica rice and Beijing indica rice were not available for sampling.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: After opening at 24 yuan the day before, suppliers found that the higher costs due to the contracted foreign exchange rate made it difficult to agree on a price, so they insisted on not selling cheaply. However, local retailers, noting the good quality, made many inquiries. New Saigon rice jumped by one yuan, with a price of 25 yuan. Aged Saigon rice rose to 22.8 yuan, but suppliers were unwilling to sell it off cheaply again. Total trading volume was only slightly over 300 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Nanyang Flour Sales Turn Brisk; Factory Prices Continue to Rise by One Jiao; Wheat Continues to Be Hoarded <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The flour market continued to rise by one jiao, with factory prices for No. 2 flour at 4.85 yuan. Local customers all paid in cash. Since the tightening of foreign exchange and rising prices, the flour market has been trending upward. However, due to sluggish customer sales and problems with recovering payments, it has not risen steadily. Yesterday, demand from Xiamen and other places in Nanyang suddenly turned strong. Although the exchange rate situation meant that there were no large transactions with the Northern traders, retail sales were also quite active. Therefore, factory prices continued to increase by one jiao, and customer requests for payment via exchange were rejected. Total trading volume was over 40,000 bags, all purchased by local customers in small quantities. Currently, flour mills have reduced production, so the market is quite lively.</p>
<p>New wheat arrivals continue to increase, mainly Anhui wheat, followed by Changzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, and Suzhou wheat. Since traders from Shantou made inquiries the day before, sentiment has been boosted. Combined with rising flour prices, suppliers are holding firm. However, Chinese and Japanese factories are not very interested, while hoarding continues to be active. A total of over 1,500 bags of Changzhou, Danyang, Kunshan, and Suzhou wheat were sold at prices ranging from 6.88 to 7.1 yuan, an increase of 2-3 fen from the end of last week.</p>
<p>On the export side, on the 25th, 1,000 bags of flour were shipped to Weihaiwei, 1,000 bags to Tanggu, and 4,000 bags to Tianjin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the oil market remained strong. The unprecedented high prices of the 21st reappeared. Although purchases by local and Hong Kong traders decreased, trading was very lively, causing market sentiment to soar. Peanut oil initially softened but then rose, ultimately increasing by 1 to 3.5 yuan compared to last Saturday. A total of 300 containers of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 43.5 yuan, before falling to 42.5 yuan. Two hundred barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded, with the price rising from 54 yuan to 56 yuan. Fifty barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded at 52 to 52.2 yuan. Soybean oil rose by 0.5 to 1 yuan. A total of 100 containers of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 36.1 yuan, 50 containers of Qingqi oil at 36.5 yuan, 100 barrels of Tianjin barrel oil at 49.5 yuan, 300 barrels of Kobe Dalian oil at 50.08 yuan, and 300 containers of Yanqui oil at 36.9 yuan. Prices have exceeded the record of the 21st.</p>
<p>On the 24th, 1,000 barrels of tung oil were shipped to Tianjin, 1,000 containers of soybean oil to Tianjin, 1,090 containers to Yantai, and 5,565 tins and 578 containers to Qingdao.

Also on the 25th, 2,535 tins and 422 containers of crude oil, 355 bags of soybeans, 800 bags of groundnut kernels, and 575 bags of sesame were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Constrained by Discount Rate <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>According to the London telegraph, the sugar market remained relatively unchanged yesterday, with August at 7 shillings, December at 6 shillings 2.5 pence, and March of next year at 6 shillings 3.75 pence. Local guild quotes fluctuated due to the tightening of the exchange rate premium. Spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar varied slightly, with local godown at 34.3 yuan and foreign godown at 34 yuan. Re-export goods were at 26 yuan. Taikoo Car White B-mark West godown was at 37.2 yuan to 37 yuan, and East godown was at 36.8 yuan, with about 200 bags traded, with little fluctuation. CW-mark West godown was at 36.4 yuan, slightly lower, CW-mark was at 34 yuan, slightly lower. DY-mark West godown was at 35.8 yuan, East godown was at 35.6 yuan, with about 200 bags traded. HX-mark was at 35.6 yuan (West godown) and 35.4 yuan (East godown), slightly lower. H-mark Car Red remained unchanged. Spot price for Dutch Red rose by 0.5 yuan to 27.5 yuan. Re-export initially rose by 0.5 yuan to 20.5 yuan, then rose by 0.4 yuan to 20.9 yuan, with 100 bags traded. Domestic sugar quotes were uniformly raised due to the high exchange rate premium. Full Three Spikes was quoted at 40 yuan, Zhengmian Red at 30 yuan, Tiquing at 24-25 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 23 yuan, and Gaodiao Qing at 21 yuan. Some offered Huizhou white at 36 yuan, an increase of 5-6 yuan compared to before, with only a few dozen bags traded. The rest did not result in transactions.</p>
<p>Sugar imports yesterday included 294 bags from Beihai, 1,675 bags from Haikou, 2,390 bags from Hong Kong, and 40 cases of rock sugar from Beihai.</p>

<p>Refined Coal: Recently, business has picked up because coal briquette prices have risen from 38 yuan to 51 yuan, an increase of over 10 yuan per ton. Therefore, prices are also being raised accordingly, effective immediately, by eight yuan. For transactions among dealers, large refined coal is 52 yuan per ton, and small coal is 50 yuan. Retail prices at door-front stores are 2.8 yuan and 2.6 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Indian Coal: Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's "Induna" arrived from Calcutta carrying 7,936 tons of coal. After import, it was anchored at floating docks 33 and 34 for transshipment. In addition, the "Linasie" arrived from Calcutta carrying 3,734 tons of Indian coal, and 1,500 tons of coal from Hong Kong (the telegram may be in error, so it may not be this amount). The more than 3,000 tons of Indian coal loaded is managed by Jardine Matheson themselves, so after the ship arrived in Shanghai, it berthed at Qichang Wharf in Pudong for unloading. In addition, the "Harmouic" also arrived from Calcutta carrying 7,180 tons of coal. The location where it will berth upon arrival in Shanghai has not yet been determined. These two ships are expected to arrive on the 28th.</p>

<p>Trading in black iron billets was once lively before the foreign exchange rate changed, but since the tightening of foreign exchange, sales in various channels have been severely hit, and it has become sluggish again. However, the market has recently shown some signs of easing. As a result, local thermos bottle factories, can factories, printing factories, and tin printing factories have slightly increased their purchases. However, sales to customer traders are negligible because Tianjin is blockaded, and there are no ship spaces available to Qingdao and Yantai, making it impossible to ship goods for export. Furthermore, southern ports have been blockaded since yesterday, causing all shipments to the north and south to halt. Standard selling prices, on the other hand, have been steadily increasing. Initially (about a week ago), each box was sold for 125 to 40 yuan, but after the dramatic changes in the foreign exchange rate, it increased to 45 to 50 yuan. However, (in the last two days) each box cannot be bought for less than 50 yuan. It is said that some have been quoted at 60 yuan per box.</p>

<p>American squid prices have soared due to low supply and dwindling inventory. Trading has been quiet for a long time. However, recently, the foreign exchange rate has contracted sharply, and the discount rate has risen, causing market anxiety. Yesterday, a batch was sold at 200 yuan, a surge of 60-70 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>

<p>— (Gu Zhibin)</p>
<p>On the afternoon of July 21st, a lively scene unfolded at the entrance of a certain silver shop on a corner of Nanjing Road. It was unprecedented since the silver shop's opening and, even more so, a new record for the silver shop industry since ancient times.</p>
<p>Under the strong sunlight, the sidewalk was packed with people, all craning their necks, staring blankly at the crowded people inside the shop, with expressions of disappointment on their faces. A few people were vigorously squeezing inside; having just squeezed into the door, they were pushed back out again, sweat rolling down their foreheads onto the ground, panting for breath, with angry tones hanging on their lips. But there were also people who strode out of the shop with triumphant expressions on their faces, as if they had already achieved victory.</p>
<p>On the left side of the sidewalk stood a short, elderly man with a long white beard on his lips, shaking his head and sighing. He muttered to himself, "Give up the thought! Making a fortune is not for old men like me. I've been waiting since morning, without even a bite to eat. The market price plunged from over four hundred yuan to three hundred and fifty yuan, and the people selling gold are still crowding together, and in ever greater numbers. If I had the strength, wouldn't the profit of forty or fifty yuan already be in my hands? Forget it! Making a fortune is no longer for old men like me!" He turned around, lifted his heavy steps, and gradually left the crowd.</p>
<p>The fluctuations in market prices stirred up a noisy clamor.</p>
<p>Among the crowd in front of the counter were young girls, young lads, rural women, fashionable wives, boys in Western suits, and even two foreign women with high noses and green eyes adding a touch of color. When the noise subsided slightly, suddenly a country old woman, with a trembling voice, her hand inserted into her pocket, her face flushed red and purple, momentarily turning from purple to white, from white to green, two tears bursting from her eyes. It turned out that the gold bracelet hidden in her pocket had disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>On the other side of the shop, a young couple was arguing. "I told you to bring out those three gold rings in the morning, but you would only bring one. The market price differed by sixty yuan between the morning and afternoon, wasn't that an unexpected loss of twelve yuan? Hey! Someone who refuses to listen to others!" The man glared angrily at the woman.</p>
<p>"Did you come with me this morning? Why didn't you mention that again? Now you're blaming me. You should take some responsibility as well. Maybe if we wait a few more days, the market price will go up again!" The woman also refused to show weakness in her reply. Upon hearing this, a hint of a smile appeared on the man's face, indicating that there was still some hope. The two squeezed out of the shop.</p>
<p>Among the crowd were people who were specifically inquiring about market prices, some who were making small speculations, selling when the market price rose and buying when the market price fell, and some who were just watching the excitement, making the crowd even more crowded.</p>
<p>Under this special environment, the silver shop had invisibly become a small gold exchange.</p>

<p>"Guilders are clever, gold pounds are foolish; all our ducks are swans."</p>
<p>——English, Boughton——</p>
<p>Along with the recent hurricane, the soaring gold prices have created a tense situation. The lovability of gold, after all, is ancient.</p>
<p>But the "ducks" of Shanghai are not foolish, although they also understand the collection of gold pounds: and the rise of the gold rush is precisely a good show for the ducks. Because they are willing to be disturbed several times a day by the uneasy waters.</p>
<p>When the war started, friends who had seen German Marks became smarter and were secretly calculating the legal tender in their safes, moving to deposit it in foreign banks. The family fortune in the foreign safe may not be a "business for thousands of years."</p>
<p>Doubting again and again, they felt that foreign money was not as good as gold, so they bought it en masse. The market made several breakthroughs in a row, and the price of gold soared like a thermometer immersed in boiling water.</p>
<p>I remember a year ago, for the purpose of strong-arming Czechoslovakia, Hitler was testing the waters in Europe. At that time, there was no lack of heroes who were ready for action. Then Chamberlain offered a "flower from the thorny bushes" and "pigeons from the food tray" to the head of the Munich Conference, and Europe was temporarily "peaceful." But when the terror of the world war weighed down on people's hearts, the ducks floating and sinking in the gold rush also stirred extraordinarily fiercely, and the clever guilders and foolish gold pounds rose and fell, and they were hesitant all day long.</p>
<p>A year has passed, and the good show of Danzig is being rehearsed again. The dictator's conspiracies are a set of magic tricks, and those who play with fire will eventually light the bomb. How confused will the Shanghai gold fanatics be then? Only the god of war knows. Now their squabbling has made the exchange a complete duck pond.</p>
<p>Why don't the ducks go to the "inland river"? The wise master will protect them. After all, the life of storms and waves on the isolated island is a headache.</p>
<p>Naturally, unless we are on the land of our motherland, we will not get the protection of freedom. When the capitalists staying in Shanghai transform themselves into national capitalists in the inland, "all our ducks are swans."</p>
<h3 id="e112">Biographies of Female Storytellers <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>On the Charity Performances of Female Storytellers</p>
<p>"Records of the Pleasure Quarters": "The foreign concessions have always had 'book chambers,' which are naturally areas where the beautiful women of Shanghai gather… Among them, about fifty are well-known. Some aficionados have written prefaces for the 'book chambers' of the foreign concessions, embedding the names of these beauties within them, making it possible to know them all at a glance, without lamenting any omissions…" This is sufficient to illustrate the completeness of the surnames of the leading female storytellers contained in the "book chamber prefaces" of the time. Combining this with the several general records mentioned earlier, it can be seen that the female storyteller who was most often the center of attention was Li Peilan. Wanxiang Liumengshi, in Volume 1 of "Songnan Mengyinglu" (Records of Dreams and Shadows of Southern Song), has a biography of Li Peilan, which reads:</p>
<p>Li Peilan, the mistress of Meixiang House, possessed a jade-like figure and a quiet, taciturn nature. She had an elegant and clean disposition, and there were no uncouth guests in her presence. Those who entered her room felt that the tea set and incense burner were arranged perfectly, the windows were bright and the table clean, and not a speck of dust could be found. If a guest pleased her, she would engage in endless conversation without the slightest sign of fatigue. She readily agreed to help those in urgent need and would give away a thousand gold pieces without the slightest reluctance. Is she not the "Ji Bu in Rouge" that Yu Danxin mentioned, and not the other?</p>
<p>She was extremely commendable in her character. A guest who listened to the zither music in the fragrance of plum blossoms also wrote a poem for her, saying: "With crystal bones and jade entrails, she has washed away the fashionable makeup of the times. Not only does she possess a clever mind and skillful hands, but she also writes thirteen lines on dark silk paper." This is a testament to her praise. The "writes thirteen lines on dark silk paper" mentioned here likely refers to another commendable deed of Peilan. At that time, there was a famine in Yuzhong (central Henan), and a certain gentleman drew "Iron Tears Picture" to solicit donations for disaster relief. Peilan read it with sorrow and immediately donated three hundred silver dollars. She also asked Yun Jian Hui Hongchaozhu to draft a small announcement to encourage her sisters in the profession to help. The announcement was both affectionate and moving. "Mengyinglu" and Huang Xiexun's "Chujing Shushe Lingmo" (Random Notes from the Chujing Study, 1878), Volume 2, both contain it:</p>
<p>…Now, as Jin is still in distress and the disaster in Yu is reported, the government is deeply concerned about the friendship with its neighbors, and good people are planning to move grain. Looking at the new "Iron Tears Picture," it is no different from witnessing the past. There is little grass with roots on the ground, and no intact corpses in the fields. Tens of thousands of households are selling their daughters and cooking their sons, enough to make ghosts and gods weep. For thousands of miles, there are only blue flames and white bones, enough to make heaven and earth grieve. Yet you, children, sing passionately, and the embroidered banquets are just beginning. Disdaining simple treasures, you are tired of unadorned green zithers. The lights burn all night, and the joy knows no bounds. The songs and music fill every household, and the pleasure is endless. The money that people make doing evil is spent on your charming smiles. Your lives are already as fleeting as catkins in the wind. How can you squander gold like dirt and exhaust your blessings in the next life? Therefore, let us awaken to the situation, create small opportunities, advocate donating three hundred gold coins, and offer a word to our sisters. We humbly ask each of you to provide assistance and show great compassion. In the midst of lively gatherings, imagine the scenes of desolation. Saving many lives is better than burning incense. Accumulating a thought of secret merit is better than reciting scriptures. We hope that you will gather sand into a pagoda and collect fur into a robe. Donate a hairpin from your temples or a brocade from your headdress, slightly reducing the luxury in the northern district, to allow the people in central China to prolong their breath. Even flower-faced servant girls, intimate maids, procuresses, and pimps can have a compassionate heart and contribute to the cause. Buddhism originally advocated equality, and righteous acts require the participation of the masses. Rely on this good cause to cultivate future rewards. May we widely sow the seeds of blessing, save the poor people who have no one to turn to, leave the sea of suffering together, and prove ourselves to be compassionate beings.</p>
<p>According to "Lingmo," this "Iron Tears Picture" was painted by a gentleman from Wuzhong and consisted of twelve scrolls, which were hung all over the streets at that time. In fact, it was not only the "book chamber" girls in the early years of the Guangxu reign, but also the prostitutes in the following years who often helped with various disaster relief efforts. The famous prostitute Li Pingxiang once used painting to help the victims of the disaster. Now, during this time of bitter warfare, China is trapped in a great historical disaster, and the call for charity sales echoes throughout the country. The storytelling community is not one to lag behind in righteousness, and they often perform to raise money for disaster relief. However, although female storytellers are becoming more prosperous again, and there is even a collective organization called "Puyu Society," they have been silent on these kinds of charity events, which is regrettable. It is hoped that the Puyu Society can rise in time and make the charitable acts of decades ago reappear today, and further promote and glorify them.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Women on a Deviant Path <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Girls on Probation"</p>
<p>Produced by Warner Bros., Shown at the Da Guangming Theater</p>
<p>We have a story: A robber, at the moment of his execution, demanded milk from his mother and bit off her nipple. He said, "You spoiled me since I was a child, you didn't discipline me, so I ended up being a robber and being executed. May this scar give you a lesson!"</p>
<p>Regardless of whether this story is true or not, or whether it is a sermon from our predecessors, it shows the importance of family education.</p>
<p>The playwright of "Women on a Deviant Path" took two women who grew up under absolutely different family educations and whose different results as a subject. Unfortunately, he catered too much to the story and failed to make a strong contrast between the different environments of Connie and Cidy. For example, the father of Connie who restraints her daughter, portrayed as a ridiculous stubborn old man, not a parent with long-term vision. Cidy's romantic nature is only supplemented by a word from Connie's father. Afterwards, Cidy and her boyfriend Tony robbing the bank didn't strengthen the process of her depravity. If he could focus on this aspect, this play would be more moving and the performance will be more powerful.</p>
<p>The director doesn't seem to grasp the focus of the play, the whole play develops steadily, with more emphasis on Cidy's depravity, and the climax is on the police detective chasing Tony, falling into the old rut of general detective movies. However, in portraying the personalities of Connie and Cidy, they are very clearly characterized.</p>
<p>Kien Brelanne's Connie, played very movingly in the scene where she stubbornly refused to tell the truth after being arrested. Sheila Blobroley's Cidy, her villain is also well acted, such as indifference when stealing clothes in the store; stubborn and rude in prison; the indecent gestures when forcing Connie to pawn the ring, all show that she is a promising actress.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Case of Assault on Missionaries in Jiujiang <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Christian believers in Jiujiang wanted to build a church in a nearby county, so they first sent two young believers to the county government to seek an audience with the magistrate, intending to request the issuance of a public notice for protection. The magistrate replied that he was busy with official duties and could not meet them. The two young men thought it was an excuse and were willing to wait outside the yamen gate to meet the magistrate after he finished his official duties. As a result, more and more residents gathered to watch, and the atmosphere became turbulent. The magistrate, fearing trouble, ordered them to be met in the main hall. Unexpectedly, the two insisted on being led into the inner hall for their presentation, and the magistrate had no choice but to lead them in. During the discussion, the crowd had already squeezed into the yamen. The magistrate declined the request of the two young men, citing the lack of soldiers and police in the county seat, making it difficult to provide protection. As the two young men withdrew, they saw the crowd gathered in layers, with a menacing intention, and retreated back in fear, requesting the magistrate's protection. The magistrate had no choice but to escort them out of the crowd himself. Thus, the magistrate walked in front, with the two young men following closely behind, surrounded by yamen runners, who escorted them out of the crowd. The magistrate said that this place was safe and then turned to leave. But as soon as the magistrate turned around, the crowd shouted in unison and rushed forward. Initially, the crowd had refrained from causing trouble because they saw the magistrate in front, suppressing their anger. Now that the magistrate had left, their anger erupted and could no longer be contained. Seeing this, the yamen runners were unwilling to offer any protection and disappeared without a trace. The crowd closed in and threw stones, raining down like locusts. Seeing that there was no way out, the young men decided that running was the best option and fled for their lives. The crowd shouted loudly and chased after them. The two young men ran out of the city gate in one breath. By this time, it was getting dark, and the pursuers were about to catch up, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Reaching the city moat, they found no bridge to cross, and it was a dead end. The two young men leaped into the moat and swam to the other side. The pursuers, seeing them swimming, also swam to pursue, but because their swimming skills were inferior, the young men managed to escape. In the dark of night, they ran back to Jiujiang. The shock and panic in their hearts were indescribable. The next day, they reported the incident to the American consul, who has now sent a formal letter to the Chinese officials, demanding that the county compensate them with silver.</p>

<p>—Random Memories by the Plum Blossoms—</p>
<p>The comrades in the theater industry have a stronger sense of unity against foreign insults than any other group. Often, because of a small matter, they can call out, and the whole group responds! This enthusiasm and courage are enough to resist the humiliation of foreign forces and are very commendable! I always hope that this spirit will be maintained and not lost! Even more, I hope it can be promoted and extended, truly suitable for this "epoch-making" period.</p>
<p>But then again, there are also many comrades in the theater industry who are brave in private fights, and in the comrades who perform martial arts plays, nine out of ten have this characteristic. I remember on the way to America, colleagues chatted to break the silence, and Mr. Xu Lanyuan told a story of "Rivalry in the Wilderness," which I found to be comical, unexpected, and unpredictable! The humor and lasting appeal of the story is like reading Lin Yutang's Analects. If the reader does not believe it, please see what Mr. Xu said in my "Travel to America Diary":</p>
<p>Ah, in our acting troupe, there is a saying that "the one who doesn't make a sound is the real hero." Although this saying refers to the thugs who patronized gambling dens at the time (Fei'an: gambling dens are gambling places, thugs are hooligans), the evil fight between the Great King and the Second King strengthened the "law" of this saying.</p>
<p>The Great King was Xu Deyi, and the Second King was Zhu Xiangquan. Both of them were good at martial arts plays. Although they belonged to the same troupe, they disagreed with each other and their feelings were like ice and charcoal. They often quarreled and then fought. In the backstage, they never exchanged a word.</p>
<p>One day, all the actors backstage suddenly discovered a strange and rare fact that puzzled them. That is: Xu and Zhu suddenly became close! After the play was over, they always went out together. Sometimes, if Xu's play finished first, he would sit quietly on the prop box and wait for Xiangquan. After he finished singing, they would go out together. If Xiangquan's play finished first, he would wait for Deyi in the same way. They had never been so close before, and now they suddenly changed their behavior, which made the colleagues backstage amazed. Everyone had deep doubts and didn't know what they were doing? Where were they going together? This lasted for a month!</p>
<p>Later, after sending someone to investigate, they discovered their secret. It was truly meaningful!</p>

<p>——The Regretful History of a Film Career——</p>
<p>Editor's introduction: Chen Yanyan, formerly known as "Beautiful Bird," has been famous in the silver screen for nearly ten years. Her artistic abilities have long been recognized, so there is no need to say more. What I want to emphasize here is that this article details her past film career, which is not only full of sincerity and emotion, but also proves that her dedication and teamwork are the reasons for her success. It is worthy of our joy and praise.</p>
<p>Time flies like an arrow! I have been in the film industry for nine years, and the past seems like a dream. Fortunately, I have a good reputation in my work, which is comforting. But there is a hidden pain in my heart that I regret all the time, and it is a great regret that I cannot eliminate.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of my film career. Because it is so heartbreaking, I can't bear to say it. For nine years, it has been deeply engraved in my heart, and I have never told anyone about it. So some of the records in film magazines are just superficial things that are not entirely true, and not the truth I said myself. I am so heartbroken that I really don't have the courage to tell this.</p>
<p>Is this something worth telling everyone? — To the many moviegoers who love me. Thinking of the past, my heart is extremely sad. Where should I start?</p>
<p>…During my childhood, my family fell into poverty. The old capital, where I lived for generations, was my home. The family situation was very simple. There were only three of us, father, mother, and me, the only daughter. My father was very old-fashioned and conservative. He was a moralist. In my childhood, I studied at a church school called "Sacred Heart." When I was ten years old, my father thought that girls should not run out as much as they used to when they grew up. So he hired an old teacher to set up a private school at home, teaching me day and night, year after year. In this way, I finished reading the Analects, Mencius, and Ancient Prose. When I was fifteen or sixteen years old, in addition to diligently copying large and small calligraphy scripts, I also liked to paint very much. I copied a lot of meticulous flower paintings, which were very interesting. But I had no teacher to teach me, so I was just scribbling. These immature works are laughable and not worth anything.</p>

<p>The popularity of Yin Yanqiu reminds one of the decline of Guan Dayuan</p>
<p>But he met Jin Song's lyric in "Hongluanxi" which says, "You have me eating out of your hand." For twenty years, he has simply been helping his nephew Guan Dayuan, and has not left him for a day. Not only does he not seek progress, but he also gets worse and worse. As a result, Dayuan is restricted from changing a word or a tune. Because if he occasionally changes the old chapter, his zither teacher uncle will have to fumble on stage. Imagine singing Peking opera like a stereotyped article, wouldn't that be too dull? Dayuan has suffered such a big loss from him, but he still does not dare to dismiss him and hire someone else. Therefore, no matter where he performs in Ping, Tianjin, etc., his huqin has never received a good evaluation. This is very different from the situation where Ma Yunliang and Yang Maizhong, Wang Shaolou and Chen Hongshou, and the zither teacher and the actor are fighting for applause. According to people who care about Dayuan's future, if Dayuan wants to get more applause on stage, he must first solve the Chen problem and hire a high-level zither teacher. Whether he has the courage to do so is not known to outsiders.</p>
<p>Dayuan knows about a hundred plays, and there are also many old scripts collected at home, which are probably left by Jia Lichuan's uncles and nephews. Tan school plays are not just "Zhuo Fang", "Kong Cheng", "Ma Cao", "Peng Bei", "Hong Yang Dong" and "Niao Pen Ji". There are still dozens of plays with armor, python robes, knives, guns, tossing pigtails, somersaults, and so on. Why doesn't someone invite Guan Dayuan, who is not yet old and is both civil and military, to leave Pingnan and go south, so that he can show his talents, instead of letting him be depressed and frustrated, and submerging his learning? This is really unfair. (66)</p>

<p>— Sincerely, Chairman of the Cultural Theater Troupe Committee, Helmick July 22nd</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Your newspaper recently published an article stating that the Chinese Cultural Theater Troupe has returned from performing in the United States, but has not disclosed the amount of funds raised or how the funds were used. The local committee only assisted in the organization and trip to the United States, and was not involved in the funds raised in the United States. The troupe members are only related to the artistic aspects, and do not ask about economic matters. Those who are in charge in the United States are the American Medical Aid to China, the China Association, and the China Relief Association. These three groups handle all the money and directly remit it to Chinese relief organizations. The troupe will obtain reports on the receipts and expenditures of this trip from these three groups. The local committee in Shanghai has not yet received the financial report from the US organizers. However, these three groups have remitted more than one million US dollars to China last year. When the local committee receives the report, it will be announced.</p>
