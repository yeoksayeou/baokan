<p>當中日戰爭發動之始，日本方面即有一種錯覺，以為不但業已戰勝中國，且已戰勝國際；錯覺之甚，瘋在不啻。在國際，趾高氣揚；在中國，視他國利權如無物；及炸毀美艦潘南，始恢復其一部分理智而知猶應有所戒懼顧忌，乃對美國陽示其溫婉。稍經時日，鑒於美國之未嘗疾言厲色，更瑣瑣侮蔑之，甚至置美國去歲除夕之牒文於不覆，以為行且與歲月俱逝矣；及本年七月下旬，美國宣布廢止美日商的，如受當頭棒喝，苦悶憂慮，無以為計也。世變殷亟，日本雖以德國之斫反共旗幟而與蘇聯交歡，內閣為之更迭，進退為之徬惶，乃不旋踵而歐戰爆發，英法相繼赴戰，『美國與蘇聯之意嚮與行動，足以影響及於遠東者，為力愈增』；於是亟亟於調整對蘇對美之現狀。彼日前之與蘇締的，近日之對美動態，皆為遠東；質言之，皆所以企圖對付中國；隔昨德人海通社東京電稱，日本之外交政策，以結束中日糾紛為主體，是知言也。</p>
<p>抑日本對於美國與蘇聯，所得調整之現狀，其可能境界將何如乎？以對蘇聯而言，兩國簽訂停止敵對協定，蘇聯任命駐日大使，此二事者，日人欣然以為大穫，其實祇自「反常」而歸於「平常」。日方期望所謂調整於蘇日之間者，殆不僅若此而已，然亦可信日本對蘇聯亦未敢作何奢望。其望之至奢者，必不能逾於蘇聯之不復與中國通商；此則自種種方面可信蘇聯之決不受此的束。是以蘇日調整現狀，與彼對付中國之企圖，若風馬牛之不相及也。</p>
<p>以日本對美國之所謂調整言之，彼以更換外相為入手之方。外相人選，屬之海軍大將野村吉三郎；野村曾留學美國海軍學校，曾任駐美使館之海軍武官；華盛頓會議時，野村為日本代表之一；因此淵源，熟識美國朝野較衆，日人視之為『美國通』云。國交之繫於外相才調者，輒有其微妙之功用；故日本朝野此决對於野村入閣，期望甚厚。然檢討美日現狀，癥結在於國策之根本矛盾；即美國致力於維持人類之文明原則，維持國際之公道原則，維持中國領土主權之完整，而日本方以武力破壞美國之所欲維持。矛盾超於外交而在政治之領域，此豈外相之才調所得而消弭；謂將以外相才調而變更外國傳統之國策，此絕不可能之事，然則野村何得調整之？</p>
<p>調整美日現狀，要在日本放棄侵略；吾則，皆屬徒勞。觀於日本首腦不糾正其本身行動而惟責望於外相，可知日本首腦未能理解癥結。須磨彌吉郎，日本駐美使館前任參贊也，日前返日，坦然語報人日，美國對於日本之情緒，較日本國內所瞭解者允為惡劣；又日，美國海軍對日本情感惡劣異常；又日，中國事件使美國婦女感受刺激，因此影饗輿論極大。凡此云云，何以使然？實揭其隱，豈非侵略！須磨知之而日本當局未能知之，豈有待名位俱尊如大將野村者入閣之後，始足以促東京知所反省乎！美日商的，將於明年一月期滿；而明年美國太平洋艦隊大演習，則將特別提早，即在一月間舉行；此二事，非必有因果關係，然甚可為不知反省者作參考。美國未嘗疾言厲色，然善反省者應無待乎疾言厲色。</p>

<p>柏林　「佛朗克孚日報」認爲波蘭境內德蘇兩軍佔領區內之分界、並非永定之疆界、乃屬暫時之性質、當穗軍奉命開入浪境時、並無將穗界盡量向東推展之用意，德波開釁之始，希特勒元首命令國防軍須積極保衛德國之邊疆、此項任務業已完成、目前正待進行之工作、與已往被迫居於波蘭境內之日耳曼人之民族及政治生活有關、究竟東方邊境如何分定、目前尙難預料、所可斷定者、保障此區之新秩序、屬於德蘇兩國、永久分界之劃定、須待研查民族與經濟之情形而後可決、月前之分界、不過圖軍事上之方便而巳、試觀目前之分界綫、穿過華沙之中心、即此一點、已可證明此非永久性之最後分界矣、（二十四日海通電）</p>
<p>里加　此問對於德蘇兩國勘定之疆界、極表注意、各報認爲現時劃界、只能暫時解決波蘭問題、最後疆界必須根據三種原則、（一）軍事的、（二）國籍的、（三）經濟的、希特勒在但澤演說中、旣已申明不能再有獨立之波蘭、是則波蘭暫時將在德國保護或德蘇共管之下、欲求問題之根本解決、必須長久時間云、（廿四日海通電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　德蘇兩國巳在波蘭國境內劃定界綫、據可靠消息、劃界談判乃係德國所發動、該國駐游大使舒倫堡、日前揚言卽白萊斯特立托夫斯克械、亦未便聽任蘇聯佔據、遑論迤西各處地方云云、但頃所商定之界錢、竟在白萊斯特立托夫斯克城以西一百五十公里、華沙近郊普拉伽鎮、亦劃歸蘇聯所有、換言之、蘇聯已以極微之代價、獲有波蘭一半以上之領土、加利西亞東部煤油區域與工業中心、亦在其內、居民將近二千萬人、實巳獲有極大的勝利、以意度之、穗國亟欲與蘇聯樹立諒解、故不得不接受蘇聯之條件、此外、德蘇兩國現定界錢具有一成不變之性質、緩衝國之議不復提及、蘇聯政府將在純粹波蘭族聚居區域設立波蘭蘇維埃共和國、作爲蘇維埃聯邦之一部份、殆無疑義、此在外交界人士則謂、穗國前因英法兩國拒不任其在中歐東歐爲所欲爲、故乃發動戰事、茲爲應付西綫戰事計、又不得不聽任蘇聯控制中歐東歐、北自波羅的海沿岸起、南至斯洛克伐邦羅馬尼亞國止、蘇聯軍隊茲巳進抵中歐洲之核心、該國地位大爲鞏固、自不復以德國進攻為慮、此後或當以變相的保護制度、加諸波羅的海沿岸各國、並壓迫羅馬尼亞、從而收回貝薩拉比亞省、穗國實無法加以阻止、加之、蘇聯邊界已接近斯拉夫種所聚居之斯洛伐克邦、更可進一步加以煽動、而在中歐洲引起革命運動、凡此種種、蘇聯均所優為、倘無更較廣大的計劃、即無須與德國締結同盟條的、此際蘇聯動員仍在進行中、特調往西陲之軍隊、為數已較少、莫斯科各外國人中、日本人仍然表示滿意、咸謂蘇聯此後忙於應付歐洲事件、恐無暇顧及遠東、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）德蘇兩國瓜分波蘭勘定界綫、自東普魯士疆界、沿畢沙河·那萊甫河·維斯杜拉河·聖河、至喀爾巴阡山、蘇聯所獲土地幾佔波蘭版圖三分之二、人口一千一百萬、較之一九二〇年失地即所謂「寇松綫」（圖中點綫所示）尤爲廣大、加里西亞之油田、多爲蘇聯所得、至於德國所得之土地、不過波蘭版圖三分之一、惟人口則佔二千萬、同時在波羅的海之海岸綫、已延長至米美雨方面、德斯城與上西萊集之煤礦·洛慈與上西萊集之鋼鐵·紡織工業·波斯尼亞之農田與森林·亦皆爲德所有、</p>

<p>莫斯科　愛沙尼亞外長塞爾特、定於明晨到達此間、據官塲方面宣稱、此來乃爲蘇愛兩國現行商的接洽延長時效問題、但各外國觀察家則謂、其他各種問題允其是芬蘭灣南部愛沙尼亞國所屬各島之中立化曁解除武裝問題、亦當提付討論、蘇聯政府當局並擬提出埃倫特島設防問題、按埃倫特島在波羅的海、足爲封鎖芬蘭灣之根據地、端典芬蘭兩國、前於本年一月間成立協定、商定設防辦法、並由一九二一年公約各簽字國、即英·法·德·義·拉脫維亞·波蘭·丹麥各國予以同意、蘇聯亦欲參加其事、但因瑞典芬蘭兩國、事前未向之徵詢意見、深感不滿、爰在本年五月間國聯會行政院討論此項協定時表示反對之意要行政院無所決定以迄於今、（廿三日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>弗里區將軍　作戰陣亡　德報刋載哀啟　職位諱莫如深</h3>
<p>柏林　關於德國前任陸軍總司令弗里區將軍之亡故消息、昨日已由官方正式發表、略謂渠於本月二十二日已在波蘭前錢陣亡、然此事內慕究屬如何、尙在神秘而不可解之列、又「總彙報」頃對此事、刋載神秘之哀啟一篇、文末並有現任總司令白羅斯志之簽名、該哀啟略謂、弗里區將軍「在擔任緊急巡察工作時陣亡、」並稱、渠之職位僅爲砲兵第十二團之團長而已、至於當時致死情形、則並未明白宣佈、且弗里區旣爲砲兵長官、何以又須擔任緊急巡察工作」、實屬令人費解、（二十四日美聯電）</p>
<h3>德潛艇　擊沉芬蘭商船　王節號船員無獲救望　英海軍已擊沉德艇七艘</h3>
<p>挪戚國貝爾根港　芬蘭國輪船「瑪蒂拉格那」號、裝載賽璐珞一批、自該國格米港開出、昨日晚間十一時二十分駛至挪威國亞倫達港海面、距岸十五英里處、突由德國潛水艇一艘、加以攔截、並令船員二十三名離船逃生、旋即將該船擊沉、各該船員、業於今晨分乘小艇兩艘、抵達亞倫達港、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>里斯本　美國地中海艦隊司令戈特納少將昨晚乘旗艦「特蘭頓號抵此、途中曾接得英輪、康斯敦」號於哈文新德附近所發出受德潛艇追擊之呼救信號「戈納特少將即派遣「傑可勃瓊斯」號開赴援救、以淡水及其他物件供給該英輪、當時曾發見德潛艇一艘、該潛艇察見「傑可勃瓊斯」號後、即行逸去、（二十四日美聯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據情報部文吿、德國悍然違反條約規定使用潛艇、致使英國商輪船員續有喪失、英輪王節號（四·八五三噸）之船員現已無遇救希望、王節號曾在法國厄爾特島西的三百哩處發出乞救之無綫電、據謂該輸遭德潛艇砲轟船將沉時、船員遵囑離輪云、丹麥與挪威輪各一艘於九月六日接此電後、搜覓王節號所在地、但未發現其踪跡、英艦亦不能覓得任何遇難者、當時猶希望船員當已爲漁船或未備無錢電之船隻救起、但迄今將近三週、音訊杳然、恐此種希望已成泡影、而王節號船員已因德國違反條的從事潛艇戰之舉動而犧牲矣、按一九三六年十一月德國所簽字之倫敦海軍條的第四節、明白規定非至商船船員已置於安全地後、水上軍艦或水底潛艇均不得轟沉商輸、其毫無掩護之救生艇、苟非天氣寗靜而臨近陸地或有船隻來援、則不能認爲安全地、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　開戰以來、英國海軍艦隊共已擊沉德國潛水艇七艘、海軍專家聞訊之餘、爰請由情報部發表一文、指出德國潛水艇因無强大艦隊爲之奧援、極易遭受襲擊、其言略謂、各國潛水艇凡在海面駛行時、易爲魚雷艇或商船護送艦所擊沉、即在水中駛行亦可用潛水炸彈加以襲擊，此種炸彈、倘在潛水艇左近爆裂、即足以炸燬艇壳、將其擊沉、即使爆裂之處較遠、其震動之力、亦足以摧毀潛水艇之發電機與各種機械、滅其燈光、迫令潛艇浮至海面、然後開砲予以擊沉、萬一潛水炸彈無效、但潛水艇艇員一聞爆炸聲與軍艦推進機轉動聲、至少亦必在精神上受一打擊、加之魚雷艇與護送艦之外、尙有飛機、可乘潛水艇不及入海之際、疾飛而下、予以轟炸、並用機關槍掃射甲板上之官兵、祗須擊斃一人、即可使潛水艇通送空氣之缺口、無人關閉、其時該艇若仍勉强入海、必致沉沒、叉况機關槍彈有時亦能擊穿艇壳、使潛艇入海之後、無從重行浮至海面乎、（二十叫日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英扣違禁品　符合公法</h3>
<p>倫敦　情報部頃發表公報稱、德國宣傳機關近日發出消息、輒謂美國海軍切斷德國海外貨物來源之舉、實乃違反國際公法、殊不知各中立國雖有權利與德國通商、但各種違禁品之運往穗國者、英國亦得依照國際公法、予以扣留、質言之、交戰國之權利一日存在、英國則一日享有扣留違禁品之權利、緣任何交戰國決無聽任敵方購進各種貨物、藉以繼續作戰、而不加過問故也、要而言之英國除行使交戰國權利之外、其對於各中立國與德國之經濟關係、並無加以過問之意、亦不欲限制各中立國之通商自由、反之、各中立國苟有所需、係以接濟本國爲度英國仍準備予以同情的考慮（廿三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>墨西哥灣發現　潛艇兩艘　國籍不明</h3>
<p>墨京　昨夜墨西哥灣中第二决發現國籍不明之潛艇兩艘、一共地適在維拉克魯斯州三哩領海綫之外、第一艘之發現、在維拉克魯斯口岸之外、第二艘在波爾多墨西哥之外、其地乃台翰蒂布地頸大產油區之惟一出海處也、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>義首相宣言　願望保全和平　使戰事範圍不致擴大</h3>
<p>羅馬　墨索里尼昨日於威尼斯宮對波洛臬省法西期黨諸領袖發表演說、謂歐戰結束之時巳至、此爲墨氏自五月至今、首决發表之演說、墨氏謂「波蘭問題業巳淸理完畢、歐洲戰爭實際上尙未開始、各軍尙未正式接觸、若各方能明瞭維持或改造此歷史上之大錯誤——凡爾賽條的——之無用、則此决戰爭實可避免義大利決不改變初意、仍將依九月一日閣議之决議案、嚴守中立」墨索里尼並命各領袖嚴厲取締各造謠份子、（二十四日美聯電）</p>
<p>柏林　據「人民觀察報」載、義相墨索里尼今春視察比德蒙後、曾在熱內亞發表演說、宣稱、彼以後將保持緘默、直至有重要決定、始乃發言、該報提及此事後、聲稱墨氏所以今日未獲决定、而發表演說者、基於兩種原因、第一表示義大利對於國際局勢、並非置身事外、而係密切注意時機、隨時準備行動、第二則係申明、倘西歐兩國接受墨氏演說、和平可以獲致云、（二十四日海通電）</p>
<p>羅馬　名記者蓋達素有墨索里尼首相喉舌之稱、頃在「義大利日報」發表一文、略謂、「當此歐洲時局擾攘不安之際、墨索里尼首相業爲我國决定一種態度、務使義大利在今日之歐洲、居於重耍地位、質言之、我國一方面當努力維護歐洲大陸集體的利益、一方面更當保衛本國生存攸關之利益、內閣日昨舉行會議時、業已剴切予以說明、此項態度就國際立塲言之、旣與我國曁他國所訂各項協定相符合、抑且適合各國民族不欲擴大現行戰事之共同願望、就國家立塲言之，亦可維護本國各項具體的利益、允爲國人所樂聞、特此項態度幷非消極的、而爲積極的、其目標端在保全和平、易言之、義國在縝密維護本國民族合法的利益之際、同時希望其他各國民族亦能感覺其對於歐洲所負共同的職責、惟是、義國旣巳决定推行此項政策、共對於時局之推演、自須密切加以注視耳」云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　義首相墨索里尼所發表之演說、頃由此間外交界人士加以評論、略謂墨索里尼首相已將義國保守中立之意願、重言予以申明、並爲德國主張作聲援、主張惟何、即德國目標旣已達到、戰事即可結束是也云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日內瓦　據此間所得消息、法國政界人士對義相墨索里尼就現行政治局勢所發表之簡短宜言、表示失望、義相宣言並未提出任何和平建議、使法國人士多爲驚異、關於義相所云、波蘭戰爭結束之後、西方國家尙未與德國發生戰爭一語、巴黎人士加以駁斥、法國政界人士對於蘇聯進兵波蘭之後、英法兩國當局並不採取對德國宣戰之同樣態度、咸引爲不解、巴黎一般輿論對義相宣言、認爲與歐洲局勢毫無補益云、（二十四日海通電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間政界昨晚表示、對墨索里尼之和平企求甚爲贊佩、但彼等以爲時機已晚義美等國之和平呼籲、已不能挽救此巳爆發之戰爭、此次戰爭中、波蘭問題實已成爲小事、主點係爲英法德各國之接觸、波蘭之瓦解與現在歐局之發展已無大關、（二十四日美聯電）</p>

<p>（一）波方戰略　波蘭高級將軍對德軍力量、佔計過低、以為波蘭可以利用德國兩面作戰、向之進行部份攻擊之戰爭、其預訂戰略為佔領但澤、從三方面環攻東普魯士、因此軍隊佈置、分為以下各路、甲·北路在華沙迤北、其任務為阻止東普魯士德軍之南下、同時並進而功擊之、乙·西路為走廊部隊、與北路夾攻東普魯士、以及攫取但澤、並在波森屯集大軍、以資策應、丙·南路防綫為克拉科·勒姆堡一帶、波蘭高級將領以為該區軍隊、足以保護工業區、甚而可以進窺上西萊集之工業區域、</p>
<p>（二）德方戰略　德國作戰計劃之目的、在包圍維期杜拉河岸大量波蘭軍隊而在該處加以殲滅之、因此德國陸軍總司令白羅斯志上將及總參謀長哈爾德將軍、决定組成南北兩路軍團、南路軍團由龍斯台德將軍任總指揮、曼斯亭中將任參謀長、北路軍團由波克中將任總指揮、薩穆資將軍任參謀長、南路軍團、下設三軍、第一軍長里斯特、第二軍長李傑諾、第三軍長勃拉科維資、北路軍團下設兩軍、軍長克魯琪與古埃勒、南路軍團之工作為向維斯杜拉推進、里斯特將軍率第一軍自上西萊集向東進迫、第二軍李傑諾向東北移動、第三軍勃拉科維資、自勃萊斯諾迤東、進逼華沙、完成大包圍、北路軍團則奉令儘速與東普魯士取得聯絡、向南移動、俾與南路軍團互相策應、戰事按照原訂計劃逐步展開、在維斯杜拉河岸發生大規模消滅戰、結果共獲俘虜四十五萬人、大砲一千二百門、及其他軍火、不勝枚舉云（二十四日海通電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）　英法兩國最高國防委員會、昨在英國舉行聯席會議、所討論者、乃以雙方軍火製造業調整事宜為主、蓋以法國軍隊所需軍火、該國所製造者巳足敷用、但欲接濟未來的同盟國、則有待於英國援助故也、此間外交界人士則謂、波蘭國雖已戰敗、但英法兩國現仍考慮如何拉攏他國與之締結同盟條的、俾在東面作戰、以牽制德國、但美國現行中立法一日未能修正、各同盟國亦惟有向英法兩國購買軍火、兩國最高國防委員會、日昨所由舉行聯席會議討論此一問題、職是故也云、（廿三日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（瑞典京城）　蘇聯自侵入波蘭國之後、共產主義已有蔓延之勢、瑞典國各報均以極焦急之調、揭發此項危機、瑞京日報載稱、「波蘭國領土四分之三、正由蘇聯予以鮑爾希維克化、並有久假不歸之意、國社黨政制素以共產主義之隄防自命、今則開放水閘、聽任洪水泛濫歐陸、吾人茲所目擊者、特蘇維埃向西推進之第一步、德國旣將其所征服之波蘭國大部份土地、拱手讓諸蘇聯、足見該國尚願向蘇聯賡續作善意的讓步、須知德國以全力應付西錢戰事之日、亦即蘇聯在東歐自由行動之時、汎斯拉夫主義之夢想、行將見實際、德國無復反對之可能」、瑞典日報載稱、「吾人猶憶本年三月十五日波希米亞拉維亞兩省淪為德國保護地時、希特勒元首嘗云、蘇聯有在捷克國境內設置空軍根據地之意、爰乃將捷克國置於德國保護之下、從而保衛全歐洲、詎意為時甫閱半載、蘇聯竟得在德國邊界毘近地帶、建造空軍根據地、未知德國何以自解、叉况蘇聯之進兵波蘭、乃以解放斯拉夫族同胞為口實、彼捷克人八百萬名與波蘭人一千二百萬名之併入德國者、共仇視德國、較之仇視蘇聯為甚、則汎斯拉夫主義之火把、行且有燎原之勢矣云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德國煤油供給　發生問題</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　某軍事訪員聲稱、據此間航空專家之意見、此次德軍在波蘭損失之飛機、共計四百餘架、原因實由於飛機品質及飛行人員效率之兩俱拙劣、蘇聯在波蘭油田區域所佔之地位、及羅馬尼亞邊境之被遮斷、已引起一般人對於德國油類資源之種種揣測、據德國專門家之估計、德國戰時每年需油一千六百萬至一千八百萬噸、而德國本身則每年祇能由煤中提油三百萬噸、蘇聯國內需油頗多、對於德國之需要、是吾能大量供給、殊屬疑問、故現時盛謠德國正準備侵犯匈牙利、而以羅馬尼亞每年七百萬噸之油產、為其最後之目的、惟蘇聯對此、可以移入斯洛伐克、作對抗之手段、（二十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>兩次歐戰的比較觀　陳楚祥</h3>
<p>先要聲明的、這决歐戰爆發至今、不過廿餘天、在這短促時期中、波蘭雖已崩潰、而英法德的主力剛開始接觸、突然出兵的蘇聯又是個最大的謎、要想預言式的判斷其變化如何、結局如何、　不免是自欺欺人吧、本文目的、是想把上决歐戰的醞釀·爆發·以及爆發後的初期軍事和外交情形、分別的和本次歐戰做一個扼耍的對照、至於將來的演變，則應由讀者去推測、歷史云記錄了、</p>
<p>上次歐戰的起因、大家都知道、決不能單提薩辣伊服輿太子的被刺事件、、而應回溯到普法戰後的局勢上去、法國在一八七〇年戰敗後、聲威掃地、又因德國鐵血宰相俾斯麥外交手腕靈活而陷於孤立、當時德國與俄奧締三皇同盟（Three　Emperors　League）、與奧意結三國同盟（Thriple　Alliance）因披露法國對比利時的野心、同時表示英德親善而得英好感結果德國在歐陸雖非獨覇、而確佔優勢、及俾氏被迫去職、威廉二世一反其所為、對英以海軍競爭和推行三B政策而使之忌憚、對俄則因助奧在巴爾幹半島發展而失其歡心、於是英法俄先後相互携手、而德則除奧國以外、祇有一貌合神離的義大利、威廉對此、並不警覺、還想遂其獨覇野心、因與英國維持歐洲均勢的傳統政策相抵觸、而終於促成大戰、大戰後、法以戰勝國雄姿、分別與比·奧·小協的和波羅的海集團等拉攏、作其衛星羣、又與蘇俄締盟、完成包圍德國陣綫、表面上好像法國逐漸有稱覇歐陸野心、實際上法國的目的只着重於消極的防衛、因為她是戰勝國、是「有」的國家、希望保持現狀、她與他國合作互助的意義、多於操縱的意義、所以對於英國沒有什麽威脅可說、但是英國還是不大能够忍得住、遠的例子、如反對法比進佔魯爾、近的就是縱容希特勒的崛起、希特勒的計劃載「我的奮鬥」一書中、英國並不是沒有看到、但從希氏登台以還、重整軍備、武裝萊因區域、併吞奧國、英國始終報着「眼開眼閉」的態度、最多只不過提出一紙空洞的抗議而已、去秋捷克蘇台德區事變、一時歐洲風雲緊張、大有「草木皆兵」景象、但是張伯倫終於軟化、親自飛德、與希特勒商妥、蘇台德區合併德國、不久、兩人且發表聯合宣言、表示兩國間爭端、不以戰爭手段解決、而法德間「不戰宣言」、亦接踵而發、直到今春、捷克全部淪亡、局勢大變、張伯倫才痛切感覺希特勒的保證之不足信和他的野心之無饜、當時立陶宛正為米美爾問題而受德脅迫、波蘭亦頗有櫃立陶宛而　侵略的可能、英國為保全其維持歐陸均勢的傳統政策計、才毅然給波蘭以保證、同時又皮想利用「北海之熊」（蘇聯）去鎮懾德國東疆、乃與法國派遣代表團赴蘇、商訂同盟、但雙方始終有所猜疑、結果、會商五月、一無所成、而德蘇不侵犯協定、却反如晴天霹靂突然成立、希特勒至是、以為東疆方面可以絕對放心、對波野心、遂益顯著、藉口但澤問題而實行動兵、英法若冉容忍、中歐和東南歐、勢將全入德國掌握、那時德或與義聯合舉兵西向、或提出殖民地要求、英法必更難對付、不得已、遂履行其對波保證、在德軍侵入波境不肯退出後、先後宣佈對德作戰、</p>
<p>表面上看來、這就是引起這决歐戰的原因、但是英國人早有「但澤一市是吾值得戰爭」的疑問、如果說英法這决眞是為了維護國際公道和撲減侵略惡行而戰、那和相信希特勒為了解放但澤德僑而戰是一樣的可笑、英法旣要維護國際公道、為什麽不在奧捷被宰割時「拔刀相助」、而延遲至今呢、希特勒固然違棄諾言、英法也沒有每次兌現、遠的不論、近的如蘇台德割讓後的捷克疆界是受他們保證的、何以又坐視捷克淪亡呢、比較起來、還是德國聽到英國宣戰時希特勒譴責英國的話可以解釋這次戰爭的原因、他說英國處於歐陸外、目光總是注視在歐陸的均勢維持一點上、因此而造成歷來的英西·英荷·英法·英德·等戰事、可是他的話仍祇說得一半、他並沒有明言他進行獨覇政策、以致破壤歐陸均勢、引起戰爭、英國最忌的就是一國推進獨覇歐陸政策、在這種局勢下、英國不得不走上趕他回來的路、　（未完）陳楚祥</p>

<h3>西南經濟建設</h3>
<p>— 方培性</p>
<p>中國經濟建設之惟進，經數十年之努力，而成效未著，其故有二。一在國民政府成立以前，雖路有建設，而無計劃；二在國民政府成立以後，雖有計劃，而又限於內憂外息，亦未能有畏足之進展。抗戰軍興，內憂已釋，故年餘來政府，對全國，尤其對西南諸省之經濟建設，已執行其空前未有之努力。二月間五中全會通過西部各省生產建設與統制案；其後我最高當局，亦會經指出：「西部諸省為我國抗戰之策源地」，幷說明「唯西北西南交通經濟建設之發展，始為長期抗戰與建國工作堅實之基礎；亦唯西北西南交通路綫開闢完竣，而後我抗戰實力及經濟建設所需之物質，始得充實，而供給不虞其缺乏」。</p>
<p>故自政府西移後，即致力於西南經濟建設之完成，二年餘來，西南各省之產業。金融。交通各部鬥，均已有畏足之進展：如四川蠶絲·桐油等土產之統制產銷，康·滇金鑛之着手開發，川滇·滇緬路綫之加緊建築，各省公路網聯運之完成，粵·桂·滇三省貨幣之統一，皆彰彰在人耳目；近且設立西南經濟建設委員會與西南經濟建設研究所，專司其事，前途無限，益堅人民「抗戰必勝建國必成之信念。</p>
<p>農業與工業</p>
<p>中央農業實騐所在川·黔·湘·桂·滇設立工作站五處擴大稻作·麥作·雜糧·棉花·工藝作物·桐油·核桃·絲·茶與畜產之推廣工作；農業促進委員會於縱的方面，與農本局中央農業實騐所盡量合作，一面與農民直接發生關係，從旁推動農事之發展。</p>
<p>農村經濟方面，在經濟部與農本局策劃下，在銀行界協助下，各省均設立合作事業辦事處，指定貸款區域，設立農會，舉辦農倉儲押放款；一部份銀行且闢設農業專部，採用長年低利分年償還辦法，實行農村各種放款。</p>
<p>至於工業方面，中央工業試騐所在重慶等地，設立十一處實騐室；行政院曾撥款五百萬元，成立中國工業合作協會，將全國劃為五個工作區域，一為川康區，辦事處設重慶；二為西北區，辦事處設寶鷄；三為東南區，辦事處設贛州；四為雲南區，辦事處設昆明；五為西南區，辦事處設邵陽。該會對於工廠之內移，工業技術之改良，裨益良多。東南及中部之工業，其陸續遷入川·陝·湘·滇·黔各省者，不下三百餘家，此等工廠分散各地，均以鞏固國防增强抗戰力量為中心目標。在政府協助下由江·浙·鄂·皖等省遷往西南之工業，計有機器工廠二十二所，化學工廠十所，紡織工廠七所，印刷工廠七所，電氣工廠五所，陶瓷工廠三所，以及其他各項工廠。此外尚有杜月笙先生等在滇新創之水泥廠，造紙廠，經濟部與川省府合辦之四川酒精廠，萬縣水電廠，重慶煉油廠，陳嘉庚先生等發起創立之西南貿易公司與華西墾殖公司，資本均為五百萬元，擬投資開發廣西·雲南·貴州·四川·靑海·新疆等省。</p>
<p>（編者註：原文對交通闡述頗詳，茲因另有專文，故已削去；尚祈作者原諒）</p>
<p>金融</p>
<p>西南各省建設事業旣勃興，其需要金融界之協助亦愈殷，董事業與金融，乃相輔而行，相因而成者也。</p>
<p>據最近統計，中中交農暨各商業銀行在西南設立分支行或辦事處，共有三百二十二所，在廣東者八十一所，在廣西者四十八所，在湖南者五十九，在貴州者四所，在四川者一百二十八所，在雲南者十一所。由他省分設於西南之銀行，共十八家，計一百二十二所，內計中央銀行十五所，中國銀行二十七所，交通銀行六所，中國農民銀行，上海商業儲蓄銀行九所，余城銀行八所，中南銀行三十六所，國華銀行農商銀行，鹽業銀行各三所，中國國貨銀行二所，大陸銀行，中國農工銀行，新華儲蓄信託銀行，江海銀行，大孚商業儲蓄銀行，華僑銀行，四海銀行各一所；其重心所在為長沙，重慶，昆明，貴陽，桂林，梧州等地。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>以上所舉，均團犖犖大端，由此以觀，巳足證西南經濟建設在不斷躍進中。抗戰前停滯達數百十年之內地生產，竟能於戰後兩年中次第興發，不可謂非奇蹟、蓋亦時勢所促成者也。從可知半封建半殖民地之中國，必待獲取民族獨立，民權平等，民生改善，始能言及發展整個之國民經濟也。</p>
<h3>中國交通建設</h3>
<p>— 湯嘯雲</p>
<p>抗戰迄今已兩年多了。在這長期的過程中，西南西北等省的交通建設事業究竟如何？凡關懷抗戰建國的人都渴欲知道的。關於這個問題，報章雜誌上，雖也不時有所報導，但大都偏於一省一地：對於戰時中國交通建設作全面論述者，却不多見。作者特就所知者舉以饗讀者。</p>
<h3>國際交通線</h3>
<p>A鐵路與公路，目前能够負起運輸國外軍需品，加强抗戰力量的鐵路與公路，已有下列三條：</p>
<p>原有之滇越鐵路。該路由法屬安南的海防起，經河內與雲南邊界之老開而達昆明。為現時國際交通綫中最主要者。</p>
<p>新築之滇緬公路。該路以昆明為起點，經大理附近的下關而轉入緬甸的臘戌。全長的七百十六英里。由臘戌即有鐵路直達仰光。其長度的為六百三十英里。這總長一千三百四十六英里的交通綫，除滇越鐵路外，在國際交通運輸方面，可設亦盡着巨大的任務。</p>
<p>西北一條最偉大的中蘇公路。這條路自西安起，越甘肅之平凉，蘭州，酒泉，嘉峪關，而達新騷之哈密，迪化，塔城，至蘇聯中亞細亞土西鐵路上之塞米巴拉敦斯克車站。全長四千三百九十一公里。</p>
<p>此外，正在積極籌劃與建設中者，尚有下列幾個國際交通綫：</p>
<p>桂越綫　這條路自邑寗起，經龍津，（舊稱龍州）鎮南關而至安南諒山以達河內。長度為二百五十八公里。在中國境內的一百五十公里。該路建築經費需一千二百萬元，已勘定自邑寗至鎮南關一段，由法蘭投資興築，現在業已在沿綫舖設汽車路以備運輸建築材料。比為西南對國際交通之重要幹綫，交通部近正限期完成。</p>
<p>滇緬綫　係連接滇越鐵路，自昆明經大理騰衝而至緬甸臘戌。全錢長的七百餘公里。建築費約需六千萬元。最近我政府已與英政府當局商妥，決以中英借款中之一部，搬充建築經費。該睡亦已踏勘就緒，以滇緬公路為運輸材料之基本路綫，現正建築中。該路完成後，可由此而出仰光達南洋與歐洲。在對外交通綫中，亦佔極重要之地位。</p>
<p>新海綫　由隴海路延長至新疆之總稱。該路完成後，即可從塔城，韋塘子，接蘇聯公路達內土鐵路，而轉通至蘇聯首都莫斯科及歐洲各地。該路實為中蘇兩國緊密聯結所必需早日進行建築之唯一要道。據傳該路現正計劃建築中。</p>
<p>B航空綫　戰前中國之國際航空錢，原有港河綫，渝港綫，陝港綫，昆港綫，廣河南綫，廣河西綫等六條幹錢。戰後因原有航綫不敷應用，隨又增闢下列三條國際直達航綫：</p>
<p>中緬航綫　本定今年三月間開航後，因試航發現弱點，故正式通航乃延緩；據報載，該綫目前業已正式通航。</p>
<p>中越航綫　交通部中航公司前向法國航空公司商闢中越間重慶河內綫，得法方同意後，即於本年三月八日晨，作初决試飛。後卽正式通航。</p>
<p>中蘇航綫　該綫係以重慶為起點，中經甘肅，新疆，至蘇聯土西鐵路之阿爾摩塔，而轉達莫斯科。正式通航亦早實現。至於其他航綫，現亦正在積極撥備中。</p>
<p>國內交通綫</p>
<p>關於國內交通綫，可分鐵路，公路，航空，水道，電信，等五項；現將各項建設實况簡述如下：</p>
<p>A鐵路　在西南之四川，西康，貴州，雲南，廣西，與西北之陝西，甘肅，靑海，甯夏，新疆等十省中，人口總數約一萬萬人，土地面積，的四百九十二萬方公里。但祗有滇越鐵路，隴海之潼關西安段，西安竇鷄段，與箇碧石等數段。合計長度僅九百公里，政府方面，鑒於欲開發西南，西北之富源，則繫重之貨運與軍運，均非負重與致遠之鐵路不能勝任，故在積極進行下，已完成通車與正在趕築和計劃中者，的有以下幾條：</p>
<p>成渝鐵路　由成都至重慶，全長的五百二十三公里，建築費的需千五萬元。政府除組川黔鐵路公司，收足資本三千萬元外，並由法國銀團承借料款二千四百五十萬元。該路於前年二月中即已開工，現在業已正式通車。</p>
<p>川滇鐵路　由四川叙府至雲南昆明，全長的一千一百七十公里，歸川滇鐵路公司承建。現已完工者，計有；新津至五通橋一段，長一百四十二公里；　為至淸水溪一段，畏的十五公里；江門塲至叙永一段，畏的十公里。</p>
<p>湘桂鐵路　自粵漢路之衡陽站起，中經杜林，柳州，邑寗，籠州，至桂越交界之鎭南關，與滇越鐵路支綫接軌，全長九百五十公里。分四段興築：以衡陽桂林為第一段，桂林柳州為第二段，柳州邕甯為第三段，邑甯鎮南關為第四段。衡桂段，長的三百公里，需建築費三千六百萬元，經一年半之工作，已於去年十月一日通車。其餘三段，預定今年冬季，全部完成。</p>
<p>寶成與竇蘭鐵路　隴海鐵路通至實鷄後，即有西上與南下二路；西上者，以蘭州為目標，南下者，以成都為終點。政府以竇成綫之經濟價值較大，且為西北西南兩大鐵路系統之主要聯絡綫，故決定先行建築。該路長約五百公里，建造費的需五千萬元，已向比國銀行籌備，行將開始動工興築。至　蘭綫，一俟寶成綫竣工後，即行興築。</p>
<p>湘黔鐵路　全長約一千公里，建築與設備費約需一萬六千萬元；由株州經湘潭，湘鄕，新化，芷江，而達貴陽。株州至湘鄉一段，業已完成。</p>
<p>川黔鐵路　以成都為起點，中經重慶，崇溪河，松坎，桐梓，而達貴陽。全綫長約九百七十九公里，業已通車。</p>
<p>川陝鐵路　自成都起，經新都，廣漢，德陽，羅江，綿陽，梓潼，劍閣，昭化，廣元，而至陝西甯羗為止。從綿陽至甯羗長約四百十二公里的一段，已通車；此段在趕修中。</p>
<p>川鄂鐵路　以簡陽車站為起點，經樂至，遂甯，蓮溪，南充，岳池，廣安，渠縣，大竹，梁山，萬縣，渡長江而達鄂省之利川。全路長八百零九公里，簡陽至渠縣段，畏的四百七十公里，已經通事；分水嶺至萬縣，長的四十五公里一段，亦已完成。</p>
<p>川康鐵路　由成都起，經雙流，新津，卭塖，名山，雅安，天　，　定，而達康定，全長三百七十三公里。成都至雅安長一百七十三公里段，現已通車；雅安至康定段，在趕築中。</p>
<p>川貴鐵路　此路從川陝路的統陽起，經彰明，江油，平武，松潘至素格藏寺而達靑海；全長的五百五十二公里。綿陽至江油長的五十三公里段，已通車。</p>
<p>川甘鐵路　自川陝路昭化站起，經保甯院而達甘省之碧口；全長約一百公里，亦在計劃與築中。</p>
<p>此外，政府尙擬以西北之蘭州為中心，建築包蘭綫，甘新綫，廿靑綫等，若上述之鐵路網一旦完成，那末，西北，西南諸省，即可連成一氣。</p>
<p>B公路　據去年交通部報吿：自抗戰爆發後，在西南，西北等省，已築成一千六百餘公里新綫，修好一千六百二十二公里的舊綫，這是去年度的數字，不能適合現在，是極為明顯的。（未完）</p>
<h3>戰時日本海運業之瞻望</h3>
<p>— 李叔民</p>
<p>（六）南美西岸綫自香港經日本，檀香山，舊金山，沿美洲西岸南下而至智利之法爾巴來索（Vatoaraiss）。每月航行一次。</p>
<p>（七）南美東岸綫　自日本經香港，新嘉坡，橫過印度洋，繞好望角，渡南大西洋而南美東岸之阿根廷與巴西。每月一次。</p>
<p>（八）中國特快綫　自上海經長崎達神戶。每四日一次。此綫約有五千噸巨輪二艘來往，須時二十六小時。</p>
<p>觀諸以上八綫已槪然可窺見其一班矣：</p>
<p>而日本又為戰時原料及食糧（如橄欖油，橡皮，鐵，米，棉等等）藉他國之進口者故，戰爭阻止進口物，日本必致大起恐慌，又有上决大戰中之英國為殷鏡；鑒於此，日本更積極採取英國同樣之措置，以發揮其威力於太平洋之戰區，且更冀其海運商業擴展至東印度，亞洲之東南，以及北美洲。據日本某著名評論家曰，日本前年之海運商業如下：</p>
<p>（一）對亞洲大陸，香港以北－19％</p>
<p>（二）對亞洲大陸，香港以南（包括香港）－18％</p>
<p>（三）對東印度，菲列賓等－11.5％</p>
<p>（四）對南北美洲－33％</p>
<p>（五）其他如新加坡——18.5％</p>
<p>雙該評論者暗示曰；在戰爭期問將有48％之商業與英國斷絕，而是48％之商　尚未有美洲和亞洲大陸之北部。</p>
<p>上次大戰時，英國會於狄海中封鎖其敵人，因之侵略者之商業經營幾乎絕無僅有。然此於日本適得其反，其商業竟能延至數千里外，此為人所難以置信者。彼又能剷除或封鎖各强有力之商業侵略者，允注意新式巡洋艦保護下之商業運輸。故上次大戰時其海運商業版圖擴展極廣犬。由下述距離可證實：</p>
<p>（一）日本到朝鮮…一二〇哩</p>
<p>（二）日本到上海…四七〇哩</p>
<p>（三）日本到舊金山…四七六〇哩</p>
<p>（四）日本到墨西哥…六九</p>
<p>日本之海運商業若冀其於戰時中存在，則巡洋艦必大量製造，且據某專家估計，每艘須重三十萬噸。因戰爭期間之商業，非巡洋艦即不能維持之於數千里之外。本來之需要，至多用於日本至朝鮮和上海之水路間，復漸漸擴至歐洲和英格蘭矣。按日本之維持其海運商業使他國不斷供給原料和維持其固有之出口貨，以穩定國內之經濟狀况，原為其二大戰時經濟問題，而此二問題之解決全得力於巡洋艦之功。因之巡洋艦亦將無限制之製造，非五，五，三之比例所可限。</p>

<p>黑巿滙價成新水準</p>
<p>至於上海黑市外匯、巳全為投機者所操縱、平準外匯基金委員會已不予維持、決聽其自然、自歐戰爆發後、擁有外匯者驚惶失措、紛紛出售、此間匯市、會表示非常之堅銳氣象、但不數日、疑懼之情緒、即歸消澤、匯價仍徘徊於三辦士半至四辦士之間、於是今之滙價如縮至三辦士半以下時、即遭遇堅强之阻力、一方如長至四辦士以上、亦非環境所許、似已成為之「天然水準」、</p>
<p>投機造謠均不足信</p>
<p>因此揣機者無厚利可圖、故意造謠、使市塲發生劇烈波動、如日前之和平謠言、以及發行外匯券等、今則已證實市塲所傳之謠言、完全毫無　據、但市塲上各項五花八門之新謠言、依然濃厚、故此後之上海外滙黑市之波動、事實上勢所艱免、但是項外匯黑市價格、已不足以代表法幣之地位、</p>

<h3>藉口歐戰囤積白煤</h3>
<p>廠商極為焦慮　各工業受影響</p>
<p>月前外匯頻縮時、煤商將印度煤等居奇、再在暗中大舉搜集某國煤囤積、致市况驟變、彼則乘機將無滙票關係三十餘元一噸之煤、突然提高五十餘元、繼則步漲至八十餘元、致市况紊亂、近更藉口歐戰、將白煤屑搜集囤積、致數種工廠燃料缺乏、無貨可購、煤球價亦一日數漲、各廠商等極為焦慮、</p>
<h3>越界築路交涉呈報領團辦理　滬西曹家渡暴徒橫行　公共汽車司機被綁架</h3>
<p>據可靠消息、工部局已將越界築路交涉經過、呈報領團辦理、因有關公共租界之重大行政事件、必須經領團會商、呈報各有關國家政府、始得作最後決定、在領團未有辦法前、工部局方面、自當竭盡方法、維護權益、惟日偽方面、抱蠶食態度、不斷侵入、於是越界築路地帶、形成巡捕與偽警對峙狀態、緊張局勢、依然未减、</p>
<p>暴徒白晝綁架司機</p>
<p>滬西曹家渡五角塲、為十路公共汽車之終點、昨日下午四時四十五分、第三十一號路牌十路公共汽車駛至該處大新照相館門首、尚未停車之際、突有便衣暴徒九人、大　身穿藍布短褲褂、上前喝令該車第三九十號司機下車、司鐵不從、暴徒等即袖出盒子砲、向渠威脅、乘客二十餘人諸狀、相顧失色、該車再停、即相率趨避、該司機被迫下車後、即被暴徒挾持向西而去、當出事時、附近巡捕及偽警等面面相覷、未加干涉、被綁原因、無法探悉、</p>
<p>已有十處設偽警所</p>
<p>日偽軍警、侵入越界築路、企圖攫取警權、積極在該區擴設偽警所、茲據大中社記者實地調查、該區偽警所、計有（一）大西路在家弄、（二）大西路朱家宅、（三）大西路哥倫比亞路口、（四）憶定盤路諸安　、（五）白利南路安樂廠對面、（六）極司非而路三角塲西首、（七）勞勃生路膠州路東首、（八）勞勃生路中華燈泡廠對面、（九）極司非而路金司徒廟、（十）康腦脫路新加坡路口、上列十處、均屬於極司非而路開納路口偽警「西區分署」所管轄、</p>

<h3>難童敎養院幹事李如璋遭暗殺　昨在天蟾舞台送客遇剌　一彈適中要害不治殞命</h3>
<p>福州路雲南路口天蟾舞台門首、於昨日正午十二時四十分許、會發生槍殺案一起、被害奢即本市難童教秀院之總幹事李璋、案情撲朔迷離、傳說不一、茲將當時情形、誌之如次、</p>
<p>新院落成播音募款</p>
<p>上海難童敎養院、於去年冬間方經設立、其院址即在法租界霞飛路金神父路七十八弄九號內收養難童的五百名、由袁禮敦任董事長、陳濟成為院長、而由李如璋為該院總幹事、因得各界善士踴躍輸、將故成績斐然可觀、且以原址嫌窄、乃在公共租界武定路二五八弄內另建院址、其門牌號碼為第九十九號、昨日適逢新址落成、乃特假座本市天蟾·中西·中美·新都·商業·新聲等六家廣播電台舉辦播音節目、並勸募認養難童及添建工塲經費、</p>
<p>送客登車忽然中彈</p>
<p>李如璋係在天蟾電台担任招待及總報告之職、身穿西服、鼻架眼鏡工作、至為辛勞、比至中午十二時半左右、該節目中所規定之某君致詞一節已經完畢、某君隨起身下樓謀歸、李乃代表該院答謝、並送客下樓登車、不料在客方經跨上汽車、正將開行、而李亦返身拾級登樓之際、該臺門首附近槍聲忽起、連開兩槍、斯時客車已踏足馬力、一穿而去、李在槍聲之後、忽然倒地、該兇手見目的已達、即向人叢中竄逃無踪、</p>
<p>腹部劇傷不治畢命</p>
<p>雖經就近崗捕急加搜索、已屬鴻飛冥冥矣、乃將情報吿該管捕房、當派探捕馳往兜捕查勘、天蟾舞臺忽然門臨時緊閉澈底搜查、但無結果、一面亟將李如璋飛送仁濟醫院求治、經醫師診察之下、發覺李之背部曾中一槍、彈由後背貫入腹部而穿出、且因流血過多、勢極危殆、當經該院醫師極力設法施救、無奈傷勢太重、且屬要害、致延當日下午二時許、在院傷重身死、遺體已送騐屍所、待今晨報請法院檢騐後、轉移至盡惇信路樂園殯儀館、定明日午後大殮、所有治喪事務、現有敎養院可同人為之主持、</p>
<p>曾任縣長現辦善舉</p>
<p>查李如璋為浙之嘉興人、現年五十二歲、生剛直、富於毅力、對於友朋間義俠過人、曾任本巿商會商務股幹事、嘉興縣縣長、二十六軍軍法官、民十六開始主辦敎育、設立西門小學、八一三戰後、因鑒難童之流難慘苦、乃極力籌辦敎養院、經數月之苦幹、克底於成、厥功至偉、而當時所收難童、僅二十七名、李之寓所係在法租界薩坡賽路第二零三號、、其夫人亦在滬寓、</p>
<p>平糶全部結束　糶出貢米八千零五十九石　合計國幣十六萬一千餘元　二次平糶暫緩舉辦</p>
<p>四貢米平糶處、按日分配平糶完好貢米七千包、業於前日完全糶畢、昨日各平糶處繼續平糶碎米一天、遂告結束、兩租界共計糶出貢米八千零五十九石一斗九升、售得國幣合計十六萬一千一百八十三元八角、第二决平糶決暫緩舉辦、茲分誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>四平糶處業已結束</p>
<p>英法兩租界五貢米糶處、除北河南路老靶子路第一處業於本月二十日宜告結束外、茲公共租界第二第三兩處及法租界第四第五兩處共計四平糶處、按日分配平糶、完好貢米七千包、業於前日完全糶畢、昨日繼續平糶碎米一天、共計一千包、每處二百五十包、均於昨日下午三時相繼糶去、新聲社記者昨日走訪英法兩租界四平糶處、據各處負責人告悉、一千包碎米質地甚佳、並甚乾燥、故糶得此項碎米平民、莫不喜形於色、茲決於今日辦理結束、至第三處（檳榔路玉佛寺）昨日將全部應用物件、已移交米號業同業公會、</p>
<p>平糶統計大致辦妥</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨日往訪上海巿米號業同業公會主席委昌張念萱，據張氏表示各平糶處自開始以來、成續卓著、即可結束、茲探錄其平糶統計如下、第一處糶米四天、共計糶出九百五十九石七斗八升、售出票數一斗八千九百張、五升一千二百張、二升四百八十九張、合計國幣一萬九千一百九十五元六角、第二處糶米七天、共計糶出一千九百八十五石六斗九升、售出票數計一斗一萬五千九百張、五升七千七百八十一張、二升三百三十二張、合計國幣三萬九千七百十三元八角、第三處糶米七天、共計糶出一千七百二十八石三斗、售出票數一斗一萬五千七百六十三張、五升三千張、二升一百張、合計國幣三萬四千五百六十六元、第四處糶米七天、共計糶出一千七百五十三石八斗二升、售出票數一斗一萬二千張、五升一萬零九百九十張、二升二百十六張、合計國幣三萬五千零七十六元四角、第五處糶米七天、共計糶出一千六百三十一石六斗、售出票數一斗一萬二千二百張、五升七千二百七十二張、二升二千四百張、合計國幣三萬二千六百三十二元、五處統共糶米三十二天、公共租界三處、共糶米四千六百七十三石七斗七升、法租界二處、共糶米三千三百八十五石四斗二升、兩租界五處共計糶出完好貢米八千零五十九石一斗九升、共售出一斗票六萬四千七百六十三張、五升票三萬零二百四十三張、二升票三千五百三十七張、合計共售得國幣十六萬一千一百八十三元八角、以上款項、均已繳解指定銀行、叉昨日糶碎米共計收款一萬六千五百七十八元八角、聞各處尚有地脚米及爛米等、尚在結算中、此次平糶、為平民服務、故升斗不能過緊、但四處通扯、亦不過每石損耗三升餘、</p>
<p>二次平糶暫緩舉辦</p>
<p>關於第二次平糶、經各團體與上海巿米號業同業公會各委員接洽結果、决暫緩舉辦、昨據米號業公會主席委員張念萱氏語新聲社記者云、茲第一决平糶决於今日結束、惟首次平糶八千包西貢洋米、杯水車薪、無濟於事、幸經各處主任指揮得宜、及兩租界當局派警保護、維持秩序、然第二决平糶衆望所歸、深盼實現、現經洽商結果、决暫緩舉辦、惟其原因有下列數點、（一）因目前國米運滬激增、囤戶絕跡、米價已步趨下跌、（二）各地產米區域如蕪湖蘇州無錫常州常熟崑山等地新貨業已登塲、於短期內或可源源運滬、（三）米市本銷轉淸、大戶居民均有相當購囤、加以各團體聯合訂購洋米運滬調節、（四）時屆秋收、百榖豐登、米商恐遭意外虧損、已抑價出售、故滬市整個民食無虞匱乏、價格有步趨下跌之勢、况辦理平糶、亦頗有種種困難也、</p>
<p>蘇州河北甲區易防後尙安謐　惟住民均被强迫注射日軍已不時出發巡邏</p>
<p>蘇州河北甲區、自北江西路至北河南路區域、英日防綫變更後、日軍已開始在該地段內接防情形、均誌昨報、茲再將續情誌后、</p>
<p>日軍不時出動巡邏</p>
<p>昨日日軍在海寗路北江西路西口上海電話公司門前所放步哨、已增為兩名、北江西路老靶子路口、尚無日兵駐守、該路西端之鐵路醫院、日軍亦尚未進據、仍保持原狀、惟日軍已不時在接防區域內派隊巡邏、</p>
<p>住民均被强迫注射</p>
<p>海寗路北江西路西口上海電話公司門前日方所搭帆布篷帳下之注射處、四週擁有待注射之當地居民甚衆、若輩進人篷帳時、須排成行列、自上海電話公司之西側、順序而進、行列中夾雜婦女頗多、蓋若輩如不經過是項注射、即將被日方拒絕居住該區域內也、</p>
<p>尙無不便市容無改</p>
<p>北河南路盡頭鐵門口、英軍駐防情形、一如昨日、惟英兵爾時已增有二名、北河南路海寗西邊錢江會館側面、英軍新設崗位、亦有英兵兩名防守、防務區域內、商店及居民、因未有任何限制與不便、故情態極為鎮定、市容無改、</p>
<p>淪陷區域產權嚴禁變更　利用時機侵佔移轉　法律上決不生效力</p>
<p>國民政府嚴禁淪陷區域非法變更產權、據宣告、淪陷區域公私產權、不得作非法之轉移或侵佔、好點之徒、利用非常時期、地方秩序未復、侵佔他人產權、或故意毀滅證據、以為侵佔移轉地步、不僅在法律上不生效力、且干犯刑章、業已通飭淪陷區域有關各機關、並准許人民密告、以備徹究、</p>
<p>遠航太平洋帆船已無踪影　安徒生等安全殆已絕望　已七十一日未獲得消息</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨（廿三日）夜自本埠探悉、對於美籍航海家安徒生及其帆船太平號之安全、實已放棄一切希望、據中美圖書公司董事長、即太平號帆船主莫蒂摩氏聲稱、渠會希望復聞安徒生傳來消息、但此種希望、頃已放棄云、按安徒生</p>
<p>係駕帆船自上海出發、擬渡太平洋至舊金山、途中迭遇不幸事件、七月十三日最後一次聞得其消息、時船中有安氏及其俄籍夫人、船員四人與犬貓各一頭、行將斷糧、水亦缺少、幸在密特惠島附近為柯立芝總統號輪听見、以</p>
<p>飲水食物供給之、四十五分鐘後、柯立芝總統號輪機續駛來上海、瀕離時、安氏會稱最多五十日可抵舊金山、然迄今已七十一日、未聞安氏及太平號之音訊、該船雖仍有</p>
<p>飄浮海上之微弱希望、但船上載水、至多祗足維持五十五日、果爾、則安氏等斷水已十六天矣、按安氏為太平洋著名美籍船長之一、已有三十一年之海上經騐、駕太平號赴舊金山與紐的世界博覽會、或係其最後一次之航行、彼等一行、依然生存之希望、今多半已告消失矣、仁濟醫院八月份報告云、門診二萬二千九百六十六號、住院病人六百零八人、男性自殺六十一人、女性自殺七十四人、工廠肇事傷害十七件、公共租界捕房送來病人六百十五人、法租界捕房送來病人五十二人、綜觀上開數字、八月份之工作較諸上月的增百分之十、工廠肇事傷害事件則反减少的百分之五十、可謂例外、所請治之病症、皆為夏季流行之疾病、</p>

<h3>數百年未有慘禍　華北水災嚴重　天災戰禍人民慘痛萬狀　國際救濟會正竭力拯救　愛德華氏遍歷洪水區域返滬</h3>

<p>可憫景象，天津區中仍多闔家居屋頂者、食物與飲水、用船隻運送供給之、自天津至南三十哩之塘沽間、極目但見一片在洋、堪稱中國歷史上之大水災、僅水災一端、猶可與之奮鬥、然旣有戰爭、乃須作人道主義的大奮鬥、以拯救無辜、不致慘成餓殍、即為獲得並支配該地所亟需之食物與給養而奮鬥是也</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>請移節宴費捐助難民寒衣</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>我國人對於逢年過節最感興趣的，除娛樂外要算飲食一項了，比如有很多的商舖或家庭，在平日對於飯食等，是很菲薄的，逢到「年」或「節」，非得要肥魚大肉，飽嚼一餐不可！這意義在商鋪是為店東對店友學生等，工作辛勞了一節用以酬勞；在家庭則為家人團聚慶賞佳節，或邀集親友聚餐，藉以聯絡情感，暢叙衷曲，亦屬情理之常。現在夏曆中秋（廿七日）已屆，行見一部分商舖和家庭間，叉將肴核紛陳，觥籌交錯，十分熱烈的大吃其節酒了。</p>
<p>依時序來說，因已到了中秋，若在昇平時代，儘可以飲酒尋樂，來點綴這一年一度的良辰佳節；可是現在是什麼時候？國難深重，環境惡劣，百物飛漲，度日維艱，全國各地情形，已至若何地步？最近天津水災，遭難災黎何止萬千！即以海上孤島而言，現在號稱擁有五百萬民衆，但其間貧乏者實居大部分，以糧平糶米，被擠受傷或斃命，就可看得出凄慘者的衆多！至於本市難民依然未見减少，雖由虞洽卿氏指撥貢米萬包救濟他們，食的問題暫司解決，司是時過中秋，氣候日寒，難民的寒衣無着，却是嚴重問題！最近報載：美國賑濟中國難民聯合會主席羅斯福氏的第二次「一碗飯運動」的宣言，他是美國人，尚且如此同情，我們分屬同胞，豈忍坐視不加援手！所以筆者特在節前二日，奉勸預備飲酒賞節的人，請你們把過節筵席免了吧，將筵資移助難民，作為購製寒衣之費，在你們少吃一餐節酒，並不妨事，在難胞得到你們的賜予，倒是功德無量的事哩。</p>
<h3>襪的進化</h3>
<p>— 沈錫身</p>
<p>三十年以前，我們都還穿着用手工裁製成的布襪，布襪是沒有伸縮性的，所以不能配合着足部的彎曲綫；穿在脚上，有的地方隆起，有的地方縐蹙，實在是很不舒服的！自從外國發明用紗綫搖成有細空的洋襪以後，穿在脚上，伸縮自如，大小合度，並且適合衛生，眞是再便利也沒有了！而布襪便已日趨淘汰，時至今日，即窮鄉僻壤，也都穿用洋襪，着布襪的人已成鳳毛麟角，絕無僅有了！</p>
<p>襪的進化，現在可說已到了登峯造極的地步；從質料言，有用棉紗織成的，用蠶絲織成的，用羊毛織成的，以及用人造絲織成的，可以分別適用於冷熱不同的氣候。從大小言，有小至三四吋給嬰孩穿着：以至大到一尺多供最大最長的脚穿用的。從顏色言，則深淺明暗，五光十色；還可以織成各式圖案花紋，以及長統短統的分別，男女老少，莫不各式齊有，眞是文明進步，足下有幸！</p>
<p>織襪的工具，也已由手搖機改良成電機，手搖機每部每天至多祇能出兩打，電機則能出至五十打；所以現在上海一般較大的織襪廠，都已採用了電機織襪，而手搖機則已普及江浙內地，幾成了一般婦女的家庭副業了。（可以向襪廠中租賃一部手搖機，停放在家中工作。）用手搖機織成的襪子，雖然也還精美，但因人力的關係，總不免有鬆緊不一，厚薄不勻之憾！用電機織成的襪子便絕對不會再有這種缺點了</p>
<p>無論絲襪毛襪，現在中國襪廠都已會自己織造，所以近年來眞的洋襪，進口已日見减少，這是可以欣慰的！不過原料方面，除蠶絲和一部份棉紗可以由國內供給外，其他如毛綫和人造絲，仍須仰給舶來品，這是值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>最近又有一種新出的襪子，是將寬緊橡皮織在襪統內的，穿在脚上，腿部可以不再套用寬緊帶，這又是襪的新進化了。</p>
<h3>無題</h3>
<p>中秋將臨，月餅為應市之品。今年的月餅，貴得不得了，一隻廣式的蓮蓉蛋黃月，要買六角五分。可是，貴儘管貴，上海的有一般人士抱了「應市之品不能不吃」的態度。</p>
<p>秋風起後，氣候一天天的冷了，這幾天，各大公司的橱窗內都已另換了一種姿態，輕薄的夏衫巳變了時新的秋裝。有錢的人們都在喚着：「我們又要添衣着了。」無錢的在喚着：「我們除食糧外，現在叉加上了衣着的因難。」</p>
<p>良鄉栗子巳上市，看見了良鄉栗子，不禁又使我憶起了「國破家何在」，但憶又無用，不如從今日起，自圖振作，做一個有為的靑年。</p>
<p>窮人們的「食」，從前還可吃飯，現在祇能吃稀飯，最近却祇可吃麵疙瘩了。反觀一般富人，有的發了國難財，最近叉有的發了歐戰財，他們可以由吃飯而吃大菜了。唉！這個世界，眞是不平的。（鏞）</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>上星期菜單中說起蟹的煮法，曾提出麵拖蟹，靑菜紅燒蟹，肉絲炒蟹粉三種，却把蟹粉燒豆腐忘懷了。其實最經濟的，還要算這一味；因為目前雖是物價飛漲，豆腐仍然是比較的便宜，目前上海社會上，對於討便宜尊開心的事，都呌做吃豆腐，因此吃豆腐之聲，洋洋盈耳，那麼何妨眞的多吃些又經濟而又富於維太命的豆腐呢？蟹粉裹放了豆腐，蟹粉就可少放一些，煮法也很簡單，大概普通的家庭裹都做得好，湯面上的一重蟹油，黃澄澄地何等好看，吃起來也其味津津，不過要趁着熱吃，一冷，就覺差得遠，而且帶着蟹的腥味了。</p>
<p>星期一</p>
<p>靑菜肉絲湯　蟹粉燒豆腐　淸炒金花菜　紅燜發芽豆</p>
<p>星期二　芹菜牛肉絲　紅燒鰱魚片　雪菜黃豆芽　油條鷄毛菜</p>
<p>星期三　十景肉炒醬　靑炊鯽魚　蝦子炒麪筋　甜醬炒茄子</p>
<p>星期四　咖喱牛肉片　靑菜紅燒蟹　雪菜豆瓣沙　京冬菜粉皮</p>
<p>星期五　乾菜紅燒肉　醋溜小黃魚　紅燒素十景　燉臭豆腐乾</p>
<p>星期六　番茄牛肉湯　鹹鮝燉肉餅　綫粉炒靑菜　甜醬炒扁豆</p>
<p>星期日　肉燉蛋　麪拖蟹　炒蓊菜　菉豆芽</p>
<h3>可以代乳的黃豆粉</h3>
<p>— 范繫千</p>
<p>曾經有一個外國醫生，替一個吃山羊乳而造成貧血症的嬰孩診治。他每天餵以二十五克至四十二克的黃豆粉，血色便漸漸良好，只有兩星期貧血症就痊愈了。大豆的成分，富於造血，巳經實騐證明，含有多量的銅，鐵，蛋白質以及維太命B。</p>
<p>鐵質可以造血，這是誰都知道的，近來有醫生主張鐵質和銅質一同服用，治貧血症的效力更大。但是有許多人吃了之後，常有下痢，嘔吐，及食慾不振等腸胃障碍，只能中途停服，倘若用黃豆粉便沒有這種弊病</p>
<p>黃豆粉是我國常見的食品，不過沒有人能知道內中含有蛋白質和維太命B，可治貧血症罷了。黃豆粉的製法極簡單，先把黃豆炒熱，然後磨成細粉，市上黃豆粉，也有購買，可以减少麻煩。</p>
<p>在斷奶的時候，可以把黃豆粉放在牛乳裹，每一百克牛乳中，和以黃豆粉三克，盡力調成薄漿，餵給兒童吃了，十分滋補。最經濟辦法，調人豆腐漿裹，效用亦同。否則調在粥裹亦無不可。年齡稍大，可以黃豆粉和糖，做成各種糕餅糰子。</p>
<p>用黃豆粉作為乳粉的代替品，也是極有利益的。先把麻油三十克，放在鍋子裹煮沸，再將麵粉三十克加入，用力調和，再加黃豆粉七十克，白糖五十克，食鹽兩克，煮沸後即成，以上配合成分，大的足够小孩一日食用，但兒童體質年齡，均有差異，可以照此斟酌比例，以為加减。兒童以黃豆粉代乳之後，同吃乳粉一樣，每天應當吃鮮果子汁三十克，那末，榮養已十分足够了。</p>
<p>現在代乳粉價格貴，每月所耗，常在雇傭乳母的費用以上，使為父母的不勝負擔，倘若改用黃豆粉來代乳，那末十分經濟了。</p>
<h3>世界鋼大王施華伯的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 維孝</p>
<p>號稱「鋼大王」的美國富翁施華伯Swopar氏，已於本月十九日在紐約逝世了。一提起施華伯，就使人聯想到這個世界「鋼大王」的財產究有多少呢？據人估計大概在十二萬萬美金左右。然而施氏雖有這麼偌大的財產，但他却是個著名的勤儉家，他時常對人說：「金錢是人類之大慾，但多金亦不能致樂，人生最幸福者在於行善，如有人勤儉而不若是，則其人幸福即漸離云、故余一生曾得非金錢所致之快樂。」在這裏便能竊見他的個性了，現在且來談談施氏的衣食住行方面，究竟是怎樣的。</p>
<p>衣</p>
<p>施氏對於衣服，却有一個特性，就是他喜歡獨個兒到衣店去揀選，為了這個緣故，大概五年前會發生了一次笑話。原來有一天，施氏穿件很樸素的普通衣服，突然到某店中去選製衣服，他選了件值價五百多美金的晚服一襲，芷巧遇着個心存傲視的年靑店夥，於是要施氏先付給定銀二分之一，但施氏的身畔只有數十美金，怎麼够呢？最後他請求店夥把衣服送到他家裹，但店夥不信他這個老頭兒是「鋼大王」家裹的人物，更怎能知道他就是「鋼大王」呢？結果是拒絕了。施氏眞是氣憤之極，回家即致電該店經理，及至回明原委，經理亟向施氏致歉，并且立將店夥解雇，但施氏却很不忍，就給予他Mecitolecton鋼精製煉廠的職員位置，數年來的特別謹愼努力，現在已是該廠的進口總辦了，他名字呌威尼莎蓀。Weinesoson</p>
<p>食</p>
<p>關於吃的方面，施氏不喜雜食的，他除了正常的幾種西點外，要算最嗜水菓了，而且他的生命補品——龍蘿絲瓜。（產在美國北部的伽登屬。）這瓜富有維他命B，汽車大王福特及國務卿赫爾，都最愛吃的。每隔一星期，總會看見一輛淺黃色的汽車在紐登斯公路上飛駛着，這就是福特汽車廠中的專車，去選採龍蘿絲瓜，回來給施氏及福特等吃的。施氏却不喜兔肉，絕對不會上過口。</p>
<p>住</p>
<p>在紐的百老滙路奧靑斯的東端，有一所二十七層的巍巍巨厦，就是他的私邸，我們一看到這巨厦完全用大理石和雲母石來建成的外表，就能估料到這屋子裹是該如何的華　，和值價的多少了。司惜平日門禁森嚴，不能知道究竟是怎樣的。</p>
<p>行</p>
<p>施氏對於慈善事業，是意外的熱心贊助，每年支出的一筆費用，就要在三百萬美金之上，而他最關心的是在美國北境伽斯雪萊潑的一所規模宏大的嬰兒院，他最喜歡這些天眞的孩子，每年夏季，他必要到Jominisun山去避暑，經過這兒時，施氏至少耍住下一星期左右才回紐的，他喜歡和那些孩子們任意嬉戲。至於在紐的時，施氏時常到福特私邸中去打回力球，或者兩人在郊外賽狗，每月他必耍到華盛頓去，因為有不少事務要和總統羅斯福或赫爾晤談的，他在華盛頓時，就歡喜流連在各大戲院中看戲了。</p>

<h3>戰後的典當業</h3>
<p>界內絲毫無損相反獲得利潤　為大衆福利加息在情理之外</p>
<p>「當」，這巨大漆黑的字體，在任何那條馬路上，我們總可發見在那粉白的牆垣上，或是三合土的石庫門上，有着這麼一個引人注目的特號大字：「當」——它是窮人的財源地，是貧民階級的生命綫。可不是嗎？那寬大的門限前，一個腋下夾着小包，面帶菜黃色的窮漢子，會趁你不意時，像耗子那樣地竄進了門里：不一刻，又會帶了那空了的包袱，三步併兩步地向外奔去，那憂愁的臉孔，勉强泛上了一絲笑容——這樣緊張的塲面，一天不知會演出幾次呢？</p>
<p>「八一三」的砲火毀去了千萵人的家，在故鄉，旣失去了憑籍，何處是他們的歸宿呢？於是祇有往「孤島」的上海跑　把「孤島」的居民容量達到了飽和點而後已！可是日子一久，從老家携帶出的一些平日壓積下來的「逃難本」，差不多也用罄了，唯一補救的辦法祇有上當舖，把僅有的幾件東西去典質，換得一元半來維持幾天貧苦的生活。因此，租界上當舖的開設，便像雨後春筍般，五步一當，三步一典地點綴在馬路上。</p>
<p>近日來，米價漲到四十元一石，煤球四元多一擔，什麼都漲，漲，漲了幾倍！於是，典當業也在「外滙奇縮」，「百物昂貴」的藉口下，宣佈於本月起加息了。</p>
<p>他們的辦法是：從一日起當息一律增加為二分，但是，事實上呢，這辦法却並不統一，在以前，當息有的一分六厘，有的一分八厘，甚至一部分押當店有三四分的，已使貧民感到萬分的恐慌。目前呢？在這水深火熱的「孤島」上，當舖的老闆們，這在那里無惰地抬高當息，貧民的生計將因此而更形拮據，那也無庸贅述了。</p>
<p>這里，且讓我們回過頭來站在典當業方面來看看，他們的處境是不是有把當息增加的必要？</p>
<p>戰事起後，在戰區的當舖，當然因為兵燹而不無相當損失，那是不在本文範圍之內。至於在租界的呢？他們不但沒有受到絲毫損失，並且相反地獲得了許多利潤。單就滿貨中的飾物一項而論，戰前百元左右的金價，目前飛漲了數倍，在這上面，他的獲利已可觀了。其他衣着銅錫器等滿貨，亦頗多利益，在這種情形之下，典當業味然加息，實與情理有所不合，這樣不但使貧民生計感到困難，就是社會的安甯，亦將因而蒙受不良影響。</p>
<p>為了大衆的利益和社會的安甯，我想，典當業的加息似乎是在於情理之外的吧。</p>
<p>（疁人）</p>
<h3>中秋三「不」</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>（一）停送節禮：在這個年頭，百物昂貴，生活艱難，送一筆最起碼的節禮，非十數元不辦，若闊綽點的話，竟不止此數。一人如此，人人這樣，以為「人情重似債」，禮尚往來，非送不可。但是在這生活艱難的特殊環境之下，送節禮此舉，的確可以節省。假使有力量送節禮，而不可避免的話，倒不如以此節禮費。充作救濟難民的捐款，比較實惠，旣為自己及受禮者造福，而難民們又可獲得救濟，送禮者及受禮者，一定都能表示同意，決不致因此而失却雙方原有的感情。</p>
<p>（二）不焚香斗：齊月宮，焚香斗，根本是無聊，迷信的一件事，焚一隻香斗，小者亦須幾角，大者竟須數元。富有者當然這區區，小數，不足為奇。但是以此區區小數統算起來，每年祗焚香斗的一項消費，已有數萬元之鉅。若能以焚香斗的消費，改購寒衣，捐贈難民，因為現在的天氣，已入秋季，一日寒冷一日，所以難民們的寒衣與食糧，都是同樣的迫切和須耍。</p>
<p>廢除節酒：行家字號，在一年三節（端五·中秋·年夜）店主必須請夥計們吃一桌豐盛的酒席。過云店主和夥友們都感到這是浪費，很多酒食之資來作為捐款的，希望在這中秋節能繼續實行，在自己祗少吃了一次酒菜，而難民們却因此受福多矣。</p>
<p>總之，在這節日的靡費,不論是送禮者或受禮者，不論是行家或居戶，若能自勵自覺，一方面能盡力的節省節費，另一方面肯盡量之捐助救濟，也是「孤島」人士為人羣，國家所應盡的義務。</p>
<h3>投機生意是「大魚吃小魚」　大資本家操縱多數人得不償失　與其做投機生意不如正當投資</h3>
<p>是抗戰時期中的不好現象：一般人把財產從華商銀行移存到洋商銀行裹去；一般人把投資於事業的資本收回來放在家裹；一般人在等候着機會，來做一筆輕易地可以賺到大錢的生意。在這現象中，分着兩派：一派是守財奴，一派是投機家。歸納起來說，他們同樣是怕戰爭呑滅了他們的財產，把資本從正當的事業中收回來。結果是：土著工業漸趨沒落，洋貨勢力漸漸抬頭。再加上投機者的操縱，使市塲陷於極度的混沌，人們的生活，陷於極度的恐慌中。</p>
<p>但，投機的未必能發財，已由事實來證明了。第一，投機生意始終是「大魚吃小魚」的，一切市塲都由少數的大資本家操縱，市價的上落，還不是憑他們吃進與吐出的多寡來決定的，而平風起浪，無故造謠，更是他們一手包辦的發財時機。第二，進口貨並未完全斷絕，更是使一般囤積者，無從保證必然獲利。紙價的飛漲，在目前已經下落。動盪的米價，也在逐潮的跌下。煤價雖在在漲不已，但也是有跌落一天的，因為白煤的來源未曾斷絕。什麼畸形發展的事業，都會必然地得到這樣一個後果的。而在這過程中，雖有少數人獲利，可是得不償失者一定佔着大多數。</p>
<p>如果我們去問問辦正當事業的人呢？即使是開一小店的人，他也必欣然的告訴你：「今年我賺了一點錢！」這就是說，投資於正當事業比做投機生意穩當得多。這不是一句空話，而是實實在在的情形。</p>
<p>近來頗有一點人研究致富捷徑，這一圈子已由於投機的擴大到太太奶奶們。她們頭痛於事業，她們在到處問：「什麽是最容易發財的事情？」於是她們設法去買外匯，去囤米，去到銀樓裹打金飾品。可是她們沒有勢力，沒有手腕，完全聽憑別人的擺佈，結果漲了，希望再多賺一些；跌了，恐慌着會大虧本，連忙盡量吐出。總算一下，末了還是一個虧本。</p>
<p>中國民間有無限的財富，中國的天然也蘊藏着無限的財富，能廣大地運用，中國的經濟會格外地鞏固的，自然，我們不能光是空喊，而要切實地去做。我們要說明邊區的物價高漲，是由於工業的不發達，到內地去發展工業，必然會在極度需要下，而獲得厚大利益的。至於土著的豐富，也許可以說是遍地黃金，祇待你們去發掘。（柳星火）</p>

<p>— 天問</p>
<p>「救濟難民」的呼聲，因為戰事的延長而不能刺激富有者的聽覺了，是的，在戰事發生兩年後的「孤島」反呈現着畸形發展。不過，在另一方面，許多熱心的社會人士還在積極設法救濟他們；尤其是關心孤苦無告的兒童們。如上海救濟難民兒童教養院，最近以樂善寺的餘屋，建造新屋二十八幢，收養五百餘難童。并且，由於兩年來救難的經騐，知道祗「養」不「教」，旣無法維持這些「養老院一的開支，並養成了難民們的惰性，使他們成為廢物，這離開當初的本意太遠了。允其是孩子們，在他們寶貴的黃金時代，不應該因循坐視，使他們將來變成一羣社會的蠹蟲，所以上海救濟難民兒童教養院，是以「敎養」為原則，使這些孤苦無告的兒童，學一技之長，謀將來立足社會的基礎。</p>
<p>從昨天起，他們為了「認養難童」，「認捐敎育經費」，「認建工塲」，特總動員上海游藝家，假座六大電台播音，為難童們呼籲。希望由於這些熱心的游藝家的吶喊，能够刺激富有者的良心，完成這善舉。</p>
<p>同時，我們更希望各界捐款的踴躍，使上海救濟艱民兒童教育院擴大範圍，將上海流浪在街頭的兒童，都能够受到良好的教養，踏上他們新生之路。</p>

<h3>Full-Scale Counteroffensive by Chinese Forces in Northern Hunan; Remaining Japanese Troops at Yingtien Annihilated; Repeated Japanese Attempts to Land Near Hsiangyin Thwarted; Nearly 10,000 Japanese Soldiers Killed in Action in One Week</h3>
<p>The Japanese troops who advanced south from Milo along both land and water routes in northern Hunan suffered a severe blow on the 23rd after being met with a fierce counterattack by Chinese forces. That evening, the Chinese forces launched a full-scale counteroffensive, and after a fierce battle throughout the night, the remaining Japanese troops hiding along the banks of the Yingtien River were completely wiped out. Another unit of Japanese troops attempting to cross the Hsinchiang River to harass Linchieh on the Hsinchiang River were also repeatedly attacked by Chinese forces and annihilated on the south bank of the Hsinchiang River. In total, the Japanese casualties in Yingtien, Hsinchiang, and Yanglinchieh exceeded 2,000 that night. On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese forces, again using over 20 aircraft to cover more than 60 speedboats, emerged from Tungting Lake and attempted to invade the branching ports and rivers, launching another attack on Chinese-held Yingtien. At the same time, the Japanese troops north of the Hsinchiang River also launched a coordinated infantry and artillery assault to the south. As of noon, battles were raging on all fronts. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Milo - From Luchiachiao, Huchihpin, and Chiunmatsui west of Hsinchiang River's south bank to Jungchiawan, Hsinchiang and from Hsinchiang's east to Yanglinchieh, along with Yingtien north of Hsiangyin, Chinese and Japanese forces have been engaged in day-long battles on the 24th, with the fighting continuing fiercely into the night. Japanese troops attempting to forcefully land at Luchiachiao, Chiunmatsui, and make unauthorized crossings of the Hsinchiang River have been repelled by the Chinese forces. However, numerous attempts to forcefully land and make unauthorized crossings continue. At times, the Chinese forces also crossed the river to pursue the Japanese, resulting in an extremely complex and confusing situation in the area. In the Yingtien area, Chinese and Japanese forces have fought back and forth seven or eight times. Although a small number of Japanese troops managed to invade eastward from Yingtien by nightfall, they were repelled by the Chinese forces. According to captured prisoners, the Japanese forces mobilized a force of 60,000 men with the aim of invading Changsha. Their strategy remains the same as when they attacked Nanchang: an enveloping maneuver. The only difference is that previously they used tanks and cavalry to form mobile units for this task, but now they are using speedboats carrying only three days of provisions. However, this strategy has clearly been thwarted by the fierce fighting between the Chinese and Japanese forces in Yingtien for two days. Looking at the overall situation, since the Chinese forces in northern Hunan began their major offensive on the 18th, they have been fighting for over a week, and under all circumstances, the officers and men have held a determination to die, with no one retreating without orders. Even if only one soldier remained, he would fight to the death. With this spirit of heroic sacrifice, they have been able to eliminate nearly 10,000 Japanese soldiers in one week, creating a glorious record in the Tungting Lake campaign. Although the Japanese are reinforcing from the south and appear to be planning another attack, the morale of the Chinese forces is high and they are fighting with increasing vigor, ensuring the complete defeat of the invading Japanese troops. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Chungking – According to Chinese sources, fierce fighting is taking place on both sides of Tungting Lake. Yesterday morning, Japanese naval, land, and air forces launched a joint offensive against the Chinese positions in northern Hunan. It is reported that the Japanese are attempting to invade Changsha. While the Japanese army was attacking the Chinese positions north of the Hsinchiang River, another unit of Japanese troops, under the cover of warships and aircraft, attempted to outflank the Chinese forces on the left through Tungting Lake. It is reported that one unit of Japanese soldiers, divided into 200 speedboats and escorted by 30 warships, planned to land on the south bank of the Hsinchiang River. Another unit, divided into 100 speedboats, landed at Yingtien. Yingtien is located north of Hsiangyin, between the front lines of the Chinese forces and Changsha. It is observed that the Japanese are focused on pressing the Chinese forces on the east bank of Tungting Lake with an encircling action. Thirteen Japanese aircraft bombed Chinese positions in Yingtien and Hsiangyin throughout the day. At the same time, multiple Japanese aircraft extensively bombed northwestern Hunan Province, with 17 bombing Hochen and 20 bombing Hsiangyin. Six aircraft were reconnaissance over Changsha, Hsiangtan and other places observing the movements of Chinese forces. The Chinese forces fought bravely at all points. It is reported that the fighting on the east bank of Tungting Lake is the most intense. At Luchiachiao on the east bank of Hsinchiang River, and Chuma Village on the south bank, the Japanese attempted to land more than ten times yesterday. The fierce fighting yesterday resulted in over 3,000 Japanese casualties, and the intensity of the battle is unprecedented since the battles of Hsuchow and Hankow. Last night, the Chinese forces repelled the Japanese at all points. (Reuters dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Chungking - According to sources here today, the Japanese offensive in northern Hunan aims to capture Changsha. The fighting reached its peak yesterday. Yesterday, Japanese aircraft extensively bombed the rivers and mountains on the southeastern shore of Tungting Lake. The fighting on both sides was extremely fierce, and the Japanese suffered as many as 3,000 casualties. The Japanese advances have been severely checked by the defending forces. At the same time, in order to coordinate with the advance of ground troops, Japanese aircraft extensively bombed over 30 Chinese cities and towns in the above-mentioned areas. It was reported here yesterday that Japanese small warships and speedboat crews were busy landing on the east bank of Tungting Lake yesterday. At the same time, the Japanese sent troops south from Tungting Lake to Hsinfan River, stopping at Hsiangyin, 40 miles from Changsha. However, some of the Japanese attempts to land were unsuccessful and were immediately wiped out. Others successfully landed and reached Hsiangyin, but were still wiped out by the Chinese forces. At the same time, in order to prevent Chinese forces from concentrating heavy troops outside Changsha to resist, the Japanese simultaneously attacked Kaoan to create a diversion. (Associated Press dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Changsha - On the 23rd, fierce fighting took place between Chinese and Japanese forces north of the Hsinchiang River. Due to the intense Chinese artillery fire and the exceptional bravery of the officers and men, countless Japanese soldiers were killed. The commander of the Japanese Yamamura Haruo Brigade was seriously wounded, and some reports indicate that he has died. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Changsha - Japanese troops in northern Hunan have repeatedly failed to cross the Hsinchiang River, so they are now using speedboats to exit Tungting Lake and attack Yingtien north of Hsiangyin, hoping to coordinate with their land forces advancing south to threaten the flanks of Hsinchiang. When the Japanese troops forcibly attempted to land in Yingtien, they used air cover and also launched poison gas bombs. The Chinese forces resisted the poison gas and, after a day of fierce fighting, finally defeated the Japanese troops, sinking over 20 of their speedboats. By the evening of the 23rd, the Japanese forces were exhausted, and the remaining speedboats retreated in disarray. There were also more than ten attempts to forcibly land at Luchiachiao and Chiunmatsui, but by the evening of the 23rd, they had all been completely repelled by the Chinese forces. Currently, the Chinese and Japanese armies on the main front of Hsinchiang have formed a standoff across the river. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Kaoan – The Japanese troops who invaded west from Fenhsin are currently stalemated with Chinese forces near Lengcheng, in the vicinity of Shangfu. On the 23rd, the Japanese concentrated over 2,000 troops and launched a fierce attack on Lengcheng. After being surrounded and attacked by the Chinese from three sides, over 100 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the pressure and collapsed. Currently, the fighting in northern Kiangsi is most intense in the vicinity of Lengcheng, and the offensive of the Japanese troops on other fronts has been stalled. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Changteh - On the morning of the 23rd, large Japanese warships and speedboats were active in various parts of southern Tungting Lake. Apart from a unit harassing Luchiachiao, Chiunmatsui, and Yingtien at the mouth of the Hsiang River, another unit consisting of four Japanese warships and 70-80 speedboats sneaked to the Huanghuatan exit pond, east of Hsiaopo Township in the northwest of Hsiangyin County, in the forenoon, attempting to land. The Chinese forces repelled them, and they retreated north. At 6:00 p.m., the Japanese warships and speedboats formed a convoy and sneaked back, again attempting to land and clashing fiercely with the Chinese forces. By 8:00 p.m., they were again repelled by the Chinese forces. In addition, another unit consisting of six or seven Japanese warships and over 20 speedboats also sneaked to Tachingshan on the west bank of Lotus Leaf Lake on the morning of the 23rd, making the same attempt, but they were also repelled by the Chinese forces. On the 23rd, all the Japanese warships active in various places were unsuccessful, and by nightfall, they had been completely repelled by the Chinese forces. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Kaoan - Since the Chinese forces successively recovered the north city of Kaoan and Szu Kungshan and Hsiangtai Kuan, the left wing of the Chinese forces has also advanced simultaneously, reaching Mifeng. The remaining Japanese forces are collapsing towards Kaoyou city and Shachen Hucun, northeast of Kaoan. The front line of Kaoan became quiet on the 24th. However, the Japanese, fearing a Chinese pursuit, shelled the Chinese positions over a hundred times from Shachen Hucun throughout the 24th, but the shells landed in the wilderness, causing no losses to the Chinese side. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - It is said that the Japanese army in central China has launched a large-scale offensive in three routes: one from Tungting Lake, one from Tungcheng from the southeast of Hupeh province, and one from Kaoan, west of Nanchang. The scale of this military action is comparable to the battle in the Wuhan area last year. According to Japanese reports, the Japanese army advanced from Tungting Lake to the junction of the Mi River and the Hsiang River. Although the Chinese army fought bravely, the Japanese army still landed. A large Japanese army is active near the Yuehan Railway, attempting to cut off the Chinese army's retreat route. The Chinese army in the Kaoan area is pressing towards the Hsiu River. Japanese reports claim that all planned military actions can be completed. (Haitong dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - It was announced here yesterday that the Japanese army in northern Hunan has begun an offensive.

<h3>Japanese Textile Mills in Tianjin Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Tianjin News: The losses suffered by the major Japanese textile mills in Tianjin due to flooding have been extremely severe.

In addition, the cotton fields in the Japanese-occupied areas of Hebei this year have suffered from both drought and flooding, and the harvest will be only about 25% at most. The raw material problem for the Japanese textile mills in Tianjin is extremely serious (dispatch of the 23rd).</p>
<h3>British Missionaries in Southern Hopeh Driven Out of the Country</h3>

The headquarters of the British Church has learned that a British Church hospital in Hejian, southern Hopeh, has been sealed off by anti-British activists. It is reported that the anti-British activists entered the hospital and forced Chinese doctors, nurses, and patients to sign a document stating that they were "voluntarily withdrawing," and then expelled them in an arrogant and unreasonable manner.

<h3>The "Provisional Government" of North China Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Peiping - The members of the "Provisional Government" of North China do not support the new "Central Government" to be organized under the leadership of Wang Ching-wei. This attitude can be seen from the public announcement they issued yesterday. Wang Ke-min originally intended to meet with reporters yesterday afternoon to report on the proceedings of the Nanjing meeting, but did not attend. The public announcement issued in the name of all members of the "Provisional Government" stated, "We are deeply moved by Mr. Wang Ching-wei's peace statement. We lack capable people, so we only organized a 'Provisional Government.' Although we lack intelligent people, we cannot be mere figureheads and sit idly by. We did not choose an administrative head, so that we could leave the position vacant for capable people. We express our gratitude for Mr. Wang's statement, because Mr. Wang praised the things that 'members of this government' have done in the past. We are ashamed to accept Mr. Wang's praise. If the things we have done in the past are related to national affairs and the people's livelihood, then we still hope to continue our original aspirations to the end. At this time of national crisis and the people's misery, it is not the time for us to talk about party factions. We are content if peace can be achieved. Therefore, we have sincerely expressed our views as above." Local Chinese believe that this public announcement expresses opposition to Wang Ching-wei's advocacy of Kuomintang ideology and mocks the Japanese for using the "Wang Ching-wei government" to control the country. It is recalled that Wang Ke-min often made anti-Wang remarks when he previously hosted news reporters (Associated Press dispatch of the 24th).</p>

<p>Editorial: Japan's Readjustment of the Status Quo with the United States</p>
<p>Following the signing of the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union to cease hostilities, Japan has recently devoted its full efforts to the United States. This is a clear sign.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese side had a kind of delusion, thinking that it had not only defeated China, but also defeated the world. The delusion was so extreme that it bordered on madness. In the international arena, they were arrogant; in China, they disregarded the rights and interests of other countries as if they were nothing. It was not until the bombing of the U.S. warship Panay that they regained some of their reason and knew that they should still be cautious and have some scruples, so they showed their gentleness to the United States. After some time, seeing that the United States had never spoken harshly, they were even more disrespectful and insulting, even ignoring the U.S. note of last New Year's Eve, thinking that it would pass with the years; and when the United States announced the abolition of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty in late July of this year, it was like being struck with a head-on blow, and they were in agony and anxiety, unable to think of any plan. With the rapid changes in the world situation, although Japan waved the anti-communist banner of Germany and fraternized with the Soviet Union, the cabinet was changed for it, and the progress and retreat were hesitant, but before long, the European war broke out, and Britain and France went to war one after another. "The intentions and actions of the United States and the Soviet Union are increasingly influencing the Far East." Therefore, they are eager to adjust the status quo with the Soviet Union and the United States. Their previous agreement with the Soviet Union and their recent moves toward the United States are all for the Far East; in other words, they are all intended to deal with China. Yesterday, the German Haitong News Agency's Tokyo dispatch stated that Japan's diplomatic policy is mainly to end the Sino-Japanese dispute, which is insightful.</p>
<p>However, what will be the possible realm of the readjustment of the status quo that Japan obtains with the United States and the Soviet Union? In terms of the Soviet Union, the two countries signed an agreement to cease hostilities, and the Soviet Union appointed an ambassador to Japan. The Japanese were pleased with these two events, thinking that they had achieved a great harvest, but in fact, they only returned from "abnormal" to "normal." The Japanese side's expectations for what they call adjustments between Japan and the Soviet Union are probably not limited to this, but it is also credible that Japan does not dare to have any extravagant hopes for the Soviet Union. The most extravagant thing they hope for is that the Soviet Union will no longer trade with China; in this regard, it is credible from all aspects that the Soviet Union will never be bound by this treaty. Therefore, the adjustment of the status quo between Japan and the Soviet Union has nothing to do with their attempt to deal with China.</p>
<p>In terms of Japan's so-called adjustment with the United States, they are starting with the replacement of the foreign minister. The candidate for foreign minister is Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura of the Navy. Nomura had studied at the U.S. Naval Academy and had served as the naval attaché at the Japanese Embassy in the United States. At the Washington Conference, Nomura was one of the Japanese representatives. Because of this background, he is familiar with many people in the U.S. government and public, and the Japanese regard him as a "U.S. expert." The ties of diplomatic relations to the talent of the foreign minister often have their subtle effects. Therefore, both the Japanese government and the public have high expectations for Nomura's entry into the cabinet. However, examining the current state of U.S.-Japan relations, the crux of the matter lies in the fundamental contradiction of national policies; that is, the United States is committed to maintaining the civilized principles of mankind, maintaining the principles of international justice, and maintaining the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, while Japan is using force to destroy what the United States wants to maintain. The contradiction transcends diplomacy and enters the realm of politics. How can this be eliminated by the talent of the foreign minister? It is absolutely impossible to change a foreign country's traditional national policy with the talent of the foreign minister, so how can Nomura adjust it?</p>
<p>Adjusting the status quo between the United States and Japan requires Japan to abandon its aggression; otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. Judging from the fact that Japanese leaders do not correct their own actions but only blame the foreign minister, it can be seen that Japanese leaders have failed to understand the crux of the problem. Suma Yakichiro, the former counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the United States, returned to Japan a few days ago and frankly told reporters that the U.S. sentiment toward Japan is much worse than what is understood in Japan. He also said that the U.S. Navy has an extremely bad feeling toward Japan. He also said that the China incident has stimulated U.S. women, thus greatly influencing public opinion. Why is all this so? In fact, it reveals the hidden truth, is it not aggression! Suma knows this, but the Japanese authorities do not know it. Is it necessary for someone of high rank and prestige, such as Admiral Nomura, to enter the cabinet before Tokyo is prompted to reflect? The U.S.-Japan trade treaty will expire next January; and next year's large-scale exercise by the U.S. Pacific Fleet will be advanced in particular, that is, it will be held in January. These two things do not necessarily have a causal relationship, but they can be a reference for those who do not know how to reflect. The United States has never spoken harshly, but those who are good at reflecting should not wait for harsh words.</p>
<h3>General Bialorussia Arrives on the Western Front; German Forces Begin Counteroffensive; Fierce Fighting on the East Bank of the Saar River; French Positions Remain Unmoved</h3>

<p>Paris - The French High Command declares that German forces on the Western Front launched a fierce counteroffensive against French troops last night. Following the German High Command in Berlin's declaration that "the war in Poland is over," German forces began their counteroffensive against France. French officers claim that fighting on the east bank of the Saar River is intense, with French forces repelling three German assault teams. Both French and German forces continue to bombard enemy positions with powerful long-range artillery. It is widely believed that the German offensive is a welcome gesture for General Bialorussia's arrival on the Western Front from Poland. French machine guns and artillery repelled three German assaults against French positions near the Saarbrücken forest area. German assault teams engaged French forces with hand grenades and bayonets. It is reported that German heavy artillery is bombarding the French Maginot Line, French positions, and roads. French officers claim that fighting is occurring between the Saar and Zweibrücken, where French forces have made progress, an area deemed extremely important by the Germans. French forces have advanced into the German Western Front defenses near Zweibrücken. The French High Command declares that the French Air Force was extremely active yesterday, scouting German movements on the front lines. It is reported that German forces continue to concentrate in two areas: across from Belgium in Alsace-Lorraine and across from Switzerland in the Black Forest. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris - Renowned journalist Maurice recently commented on the situation on the Western Front in the Petit Parisien newspaper, stating, "Since the 22nd of this month, our main defensive line has been extended eastward by over seventy kilometers, including the town of Hombach and the area northwest of Lauterbourg. There has been heavy artillery fire along the entire front on the evenings of the 22nd and 23rd, particularly north of the Lauter River and near the city of Weissenburg. In addition, the enemy has launched repeated and fierce attacks in the Saar, Blies, and Horn River valleys, with the ground fighting becoming more intense than before. Our outpost positions in these areas, using several small forests as cover, have been gradually advancing northward in recent days, with the main objectives being the cities of Saarbrücken and Zweibrücken. In the Zweibrücken area, our forces have advanced to a small forest (on the road from Sarreguemines to Zweibrücken). This location is strategically important, and the enemy is eager to retake it, having launched three counterattacks with two battalions or even a regiment, all of which were repelled by our forces using artillery and machine guns. Our positions remain unmoved." (Havas Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>German Forces Bomb Warsaw; Thousands of Civilians Perish; Garrison Vows to Defend the City to the Death</h3>
<p>Warsaw - The local radio station broadcast a war report this morning, stating, "Enemy artillery heavily bombarded the city yesterday, causing numerous houses to catch fire. Three churches and four hospitals have also been burned down, and thousands of civilians have perished. On the other hand, enemy forces have repeatedly attacked the right bank of the Vistula River but have been repelled. The situation in the Modlin Fortress area remains extremely intense. Our forces are determined to defend the city of Warsaw and the Modlin area to the last breath." (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>London - The German High Command has just stated that the Polish campaign is now complete and the Polish army has been destroyed. According to the German announcement, this is the third time this week, but the Germans still acknowledge that Polish forces are still holding positions in the Warsaw and Modlin areas. The Germans claim to have captured 450,000 Polish soldiers and seized or destroyed 800 Polish aircraft, with the rest having fled abroad. German troops who crossed the demarcation line in several places are now withdrawing to make way for Soviet troops. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German Supreme Command announced this morning, "German forces are advancing along the demarcation line in the east according to the original plan. In recent days, the number of deserters fleeing from Praga and Modlin continues to increase. The German Navy continues to bombard Polish positions on the Hel Peninsula." (Haitong dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - An official communiqué from the German High Command stated, "After the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Poland, Polish troops, especially those operating in the Vistula River area, have suffered defeats. After the Germans implemented annihilative warfare, the fiercest battles occurred along the Vistula River, where over a hundred Polish soldiers were defeated, captured, killed, or wounded by German forces. No Polish active or reserve divisions or independent brigades escaped, with only a small number fleeing to the eastern Polish marshlands, where they were repelled by Soviet forces. Currently, only a small number of Polish troops continue to fight in Warsaw, Modlin, and Hel. German forces are delaying their attacks out of consideration for civilian lives." (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Air Minister General Göring inspected the German Air Force's First Group on the northern front of Warsaw yesterday. (Haitong, 24th)</p>
<h3>Siegfried Line: Unhygienic Conditions</h3>
<p>Paris - German prisoners captured by French forces have described the poor conditions within the Siegfried Line, stating that the recent cool and humid weather has greatly affected the health of the garrison. Soldiers defending the Siegfried Line are stationed in concrete bunkers, but the bunkers are very small and lack adequate ventilation. If the iron doors are closed, the conditions inside become extremely uncomfortable. Some bunkers offer no room to maneuver other than to fire from within. If the fighting lasts too long and they cannot go outside, the soldiers have to sleep standing up. Outside temperatures easily penetrate the bunkers, and water often drips down the walls. Food must be brought in from outside, and when the lines of communication are threatened by artillery fire, the soldiers are forced to remain in the damp bunkers, lacking food, sleep, and adequate air.

<h3>Duke of Windsor Arrives at the Front with the Army</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - According to a dispatch from London received here, the Duke of Windsor has arrived at the French front with the expeditionary force, serving as a staff officer with the rank of Major General, and is currently stationed in an unidentified town under an assumed name.

<h3>Reservists Continue to Enlist; Soviet Forces Advance Deep into Poland; The German-Soviet Border is Temporary in Nature; Fundamental Resolution of the Issue Will Take Time</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has just issued an order stating, "Due to the extraordinary situation abroad, the mobilization of reservists in the Moscow, Kalinin, Belorussian, Kiev, Kharkov, and Orel military districts, as ordered on September 7, will continue pending further instructions. All workers and staff who have been drafted will be reinstated to their original positions upon completion of their military service." (TASS dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow - The General Staff of the Soviet Workers' and Peasants' Red Army issued the following war report on September 23:</p>
<p>"On the morning of September 23, units of the Red Army began to advance to the line demarcated by the Soviet and German governments, occupying the towns of Stryj and Grodno, and advancing to a line west of the towns of Brest-Litovsk, Kovel, Volodymyr-Volynsky, and Lviv. On the same day, units of the Red Army continued their mopping-up operations in Western Belarus and Western Ukraine, clearing small units of Polish troops northwest of Grodno and northwest of the Brest-Litovsk fortress. Further reports indicate that on September 22, while the Red Army was clearing a unit of Polish troops southeast of Kovel, it captured over 8,000 officers and soldiers, seized 2,000 horses, and several trains loaded with military supplies." (TASS dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>London - According to reports from Berlin, German Führer Adolf Hitler will visit the Western Front in the near future. Also, several Swedish military officers recently traveled to Moscow to discuss the demarcation of occupied territories in Poland and were originally scheduled to return home after the deliberations were concluded, but they remain in Moscow "continuing negotiations," indicating that the claim that the border between the two sides has already been demarcated is premature. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The Frankfurter Zeitung believes that the division of the occupied territories in Poland between German and Soviet forces is not a permanent border but rather a temporary one. When the Swedish army was ordered to enter the borderlands, there was no intention of extending the Swedish border as far east as possible. At the beginning of the German-Polish conflict, Führer Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to actively defend the German borders, and this task has been completed. The work currently being carried out relates to the national and political life of the Germans who were previously forced to live within Poland. It is currently difficult to predict how the eastern border will be defined. What can be determined is that safeguarding the new order in this region belongs to Germany and the Soviet Union. The determination of a permanent border must await an investigation into the ethnic and economic situation. The current border is merely for military convenience. The fact that the current border runs through the center of Warsaw proves that this is not a permanent, final border. (Haitong dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Riga - There is great attention paid to the border demarcation between Germany and the Soviet Union. The newspapers believe that the current demarcation can only temporarily resolve the Polish problem. The final border must be based on three principles: (1) military, (2) national, and (3) economic. Hitler, in his speech in Danzig, stated that there could no longer be an independent Poland. Therefore, Poland will temporarily be under German protection or German-Soviet co-management. A fundamental resolution of the issue will require a long time. (Haitong dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Germany and the Soviet Union have demarcated a border within Poland. According to reliable sources, the border demarcation negotiations were initiated by Germany. The German Ambassador to the USSR, Schulenburg, recently asserted that even Brest-Litovsk should not be allowed to be occupied by the Soviet Union, let alone other places further west. However, the border that has now been agreed upon is 150 kilometers west of Brest-Litovsk, and the town of Praga, near Warsaw, has also been assigned to the Soviet Union. In other words, the Soviet Union has acquired more than half of Poland's territory at a very small price, including the oil region and industrial center of Eastern Galicia, with a population of nearly 20 million, representing a great victory. It is believed that Germany is eager to establish an understanding with the Soviet Union and therefore has to accept Soviet conditions. In addition, the border currently set by Germany and the Soviet Union has an immutable nature, and the idea of a buffer state is no longer mentioned. There is little doubt that the Soviet government will establish a Polish Soviet Republic in the purely Polish-populated area as part of the Soviet Federation. Diplomatic circles say that Germany launched the war because England and France refused to allow it to do as it pleased in Central and Eastern Europe. Now, to cope with the war on the Western Front, it has to allow the Soviet Union to control Central and Eastern Europe, from the Baltic coast to Slovakia and Romania. Soviet troops have now advanced to the heart of Central Europe, greatly consolidating the country's position and no longer worrying about a German invasion. In the future, it may impose a disguised protection system on the Baltic states and pressure Romania, thereby reclaiming Bessarabia, which Germany will be unable to prevent. In addition, the Soviet border is now close to Slovakia, where Slavs live, and it can further incite them and cause revolutionary movements in Central Europe. The Soviet Union is well-suited to do all of this, and it does not need to conclude a treaty of alliance with Germany unless it has even broader plans. At this moment, Soviet mobilization is still underway, but the number of troops transferred to the western frontier has decreased. Among foreigners in Moscow, the Japanese are still satisfied, saying that the Soviet Union will be busy dealing with European affairs and will have little time to attend to the Far East. (Havas dispatch, 23rd) Germany and the Soviet Union divide Poland and demarcate the border, from the East Prussian border, along the Pisa River, Narew River, Vistula River, San River, to the Carpathian Mountains. The land acquired by the Soviet Union accounts for almost two-thirds of the Polish territory, with a population of 11 million, even larger than the land lost in 1920, i.e., the so-called "Curzon Line" (shown as a dotted line in the figure). The oil fields of Galicia are mostly obtained by the Soviet Union. As for the land obtained by Germany, it accounts for only one-third of the Polish territory, but the population accounts for 20 million. At the same time, the coastline on the Baltic Sea has been extended to the Memel area. The coal mines of the Destes and Upper Silesia, the steel and textile industries of Lodz and Upper Silesia, and the farmland and forests of Bosnia are all owned by Germany.</p>
<h3>Estonian Foreign Minister Undertakes a Mission to the Soviet Union; The Issue of Fortifying Estonian Islands Will Definitely Be Discussed</h3>
<p>Moscow - Estonian Foreign Minister Selter is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow morning. According to official sources, this visit is to discuss the extension of the existing commercial agreements between the two countries. However, foreign observers say that other issues, including the neutralization and disarmament of the Estonian islands in the southern part of the Gulf of Finland, will also be discussed. The Soviet government also intends to raise the issue of fortifying Äland Island. Äland Island, located in the Baltic Sea, can serve as a base for blockading the Gulf of Finland. Sweden and Finland established an agreement in January of this year to discuss fortification measures, and the signatory countries of the 1921 convention, namely England, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Poland, and Denmark, agreed. The Soviet Union also wanted to participate in the matter, but it was deeply dissatisfied that Sweden and Finland did not consult with it in advance. Therefore, it expressed its opposition when the Council of the League of Nations discussed this agreement in May of this year, and the Council of the League of Nations made no decision until now.

<h3>General Fritsch Killed in Action; German Newspapers Publish Obituary; The Nature of His Position is Veiled in Secrecy</h3>
<p>Berlin - The official announcement of the death of former German Army Commander-in-Chief General Fritsch was officially released yesterday, stating that he had been killed in action on the Polish front on the 22nd of this month. However, the inside story of this matter remains mysterious and inexplicable. Also, the "General Report" recently published a mysterious obituary on the matter, with the signature of the current Commander-in-Chief Bialorussia at the end. The obituary stated that General Fritsch "was killed in action while carrying out an emergency inspection," and that his position was only the commander of the 12th Artillery Regiment. As for the circumstances of his death, they were not clearly announced. It is incomprehensible why Fritsch, as an artillery officer, would have to carry out emergency inspections.

<h3>German Submarine Sinks Finnish Merchant Ship; No Hope of Rescue for the Crew of the Wangjie; The British Navy Has Sunk Seven German Submarines</h3>
<p>Bergen, Norway - The Finnish steamer "Mathilda Thorden," loaded with a batch of celluloid, set sail from the port of Kemi in Finland and, at 11:20 last night, was intercepted by a German submarine 15 miles off the coast of Arendal, Norway. The submarine ordered the 23 crew members to abandon ship, and then sank the ship. The crew members arrived in Arendal this morning in two small boats. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Lisbon - Rear Admiral Gothner, commander of the US Mediterranean Fleet, arrived here last night aboard his flagship "Trenton." En route, he received a distress signal from the British ship "Constance," which was being pursued by a German submarine near Cape Finisterre. Rear Admiral Gothner immediately dispatched the "Jacob Jones" to assist, supplying the British ship with fresh water and other supplies. A German submarine was spotted at the time, but it fled upon seeing the "Jacob Jones." (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>London - According to a statement from the Information Ministry, Germany's outrageous use of submarines in violation of treaties has led to the continued loss of British merchant seamen. There is now no hope of rescue for the crew of the British ship Wangjie (4,853 tons). The Wangjie sent a distress signal 300 miles west of Ouessant, France, stating that it had been shelled by a German submarine and was sinking, and that the crew had abandoned ship as instructed. Two Danish and Norwegian ships received this telegram on September 6 and searched the Wangjie's location, but found no trace of it. British ships were also unable to find any survivors. At the time, it was still hoped that the crew had been rescued by fishing boats or ships without radios, but nearly three weeks have passed with no news, and it is feared that this hope has faded, and the crew of the Wangjie have been sacrificed because of Germany's violation of treaties by engaging in submarine warfare. Article 4 of the London Naval Treaty signed by Germany in November 1936 clearly stipulates that warships or submarines may not sink merchant ships until the crew of the merchant ships have been placed in a safe place. Uncovered lifeboats cannot be considered a safe place unless the weather is calm and land is nearby or ships are coming to help. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>London - Since the start of the war, the British Navy has sunk a total of seven German submarines. Naval experts, after hearing the news, requested that the Information Ministry issue an article pointing out that German submarines are very vulnerable to attack due to the lack of a strong fleet to support them. It said that submarines of all countries are easily sunk by torpedo boats or merchant escorts when traveling on the surface, and can also be attacked with depth charges when traveling underwater. If these depth charges explode near a submarine, they are enough to destroy the hull and sink it. Even if the explosion is farther away, the force of the shock is enough to destroy the submarine's generator and various machinery, extinguishing its lights and forcing the submarine to surface, where it can then be shelled and sunk. In addition to torpedo boats and escorts, there are also aircraft that can fly down quickly and bomb the submarine before it has time to enter the sea, and use machine guns to strafe the officers and soldiers on deck. Killing just one person can prevent the air vent from being closed, and if the submarine still manages to enter the sea, it will sink. Moreover, machine gun bullets can sometimes penetrate the hull, preventing the submarine from resurfacing. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Seizure of Contraband Complies with International Law</h3>
<p>London - The Information Ministry has just issued a communiqué stating that German propaganda agencies have recently issued news claiming that the United States Navy's actions in cutting off Germany's overseas cargo sources are in violation of international law. However, although neutral countries have the right to trade with Germany, Britain is entitled to seize various contraband items being transported to Germany in accordance with international law. In other words, as long as the rights of belligerents exist, Britain will enjoy the right to seize contraband. After all, no belligerent country will allow the enemy to purchase various goods to continue the war without interference. In short, in addition to exercising the rights of belligerents, Britain has no intention of interfering in the economic relations between neutral countries and Germany, and does not want to restrict the freedom of neutral countries to trade. On the contrary, Britain is still prepared to give sympathetic consideration to the needs of neutral countries for supplies for their own use. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Two Submarines Discovered in the Gulf of Mexico; Nationality Unknown</h3>
<p>Mexico City - Last night, two submarines of unknown nationality were discovered for the second time in the Gulf of Mexico, located just outside the three-mile territorial sea line of Veracruz state. The first discovery was outside the port of Veracruz, and the second was outside Puerto Mexico, which is the only outlet for the Tehuantepec Isthmus, a major oil-producing area.

<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Declaration: Wishing to Preserve Peace and Prevent Expansion of the War's Scope</h3>
<p>Rome - Yesterday, Mussolini delivered a speech at the Palazzo Venezia to leaders of the Fascist Party in Bologna province, stating that the end of the European war had arrived. This was Mussolini's first public speech since May. He stated, "The Polish problem has been completely resolved. The European war has not actually begun. The armies have not yet formally made contact. If all parties can understand the futility of maintaining or reforming this historical mistake—the Treaty of Versailles—then this decisive war can be avoided. Italy will not change its initial intention and will continue to strictly adhere to the neutrality resolution passed by the Cabinet on September 1." Mussolini also ordered the leaders to severely crack down on rumor-mongers. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to the "People's Observer," Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, after inspecting Piedmont this spring, delivered a speech in Genoa, declaring that he would remain silent until there was an important decision to make, at which point he would speak. After mentioning this, the newspaper claimed that Mussolini's decision to deliver a speech today, despite not yet having reached a decision, was based on two reasons: First, to indicate that Italy is not staying out of international affairs but is closely monitoring the situation, ready to act at any time; and second, to declare that if the Western European powers accept Mussolini's speech, peace can be achieved. (October 24, Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome - The renowned journalist Gaeda, often referred to as the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, recently published an article in the "Italian Daily," stating, "At this time of unrest in Europe, Prime Minister Mussolini has determined an attitude for our country, ensuring that Italy occupies an important position in today's Europe. In short, our country should strive to safeguard the collective interests of the European continent on the one hand, and protect its own vital interests on the other. This attitude was clearly explained at yesterday's Cabinet meeting. From an international standpoint, this attitude is not only in accordance with the various agreements that our country and other countries have signed, but also suits the common desire of all nations to not expand the current war. From a national standpoint, it can also safeguard the country's concrete interests and is welcome by the people. However, this attitude is not passive but active, and its goal is to preserve peace. In other words, while meticulously safeguarding the legitimate interests of its nation, Italy also hopes that other nations can feel their shared responsibility towards Europe. However, since Italy has decided to pursue this policy, it must closely monitor the evolution of the situation." (October 23, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech has been commented on by diplomatic circles here, stating that Prime Minister Mussolini has reiterated Italy's desire to remain neutral and has voiced support for Germany, arguing that once Germany's goals have been achieved, the war can end. (October 24, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva - According to sources here, French political figures have expressed disappointment with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's brief and appropriate statement on the current political situation. They are surprised that the Italian Prime Minister's declaration did not offer any peace proposals. Regarding the Italian Prime Minister's statement that the Western countries had not yet engaged in war with Germany after the end of the Polish war, Parisian figures refuted it. French political figures are puzzled as to why the British and French authorities did not take the same action of declaring war on Germany after the Soviet Union invaded Poland. Parisian public opinion generally believes that the Italian Prime Minister's declaration is of no benefit to the European situation. (October 24, Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - Political circles here expressed support last night for Mussolini's pursuit of peace, but they believe it is too late. The peace appeals of Italy, the United States, and other countries cannot save this war that has already erupted. In this war, the Polish problem has indeed become a minor issue. The main point is the contact between Britain, France, and Germany. The disintegration of Poland has little to do with the current development of the European situation.

<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Drafts Neutrality Act Amendment; Majority of Senators Support the President's Proposal</h3>
<p>(Washington) - Judging from the recent public opinion in the Senate regarding the issue of neutrality, there are 35 senators who oppose the repeal of the arms embargo. The remaining 61 senators mostly support President Roosevelt. However, there are still 10 to 15 senators who have not yet decided which side to support. Those who support the President are confident that they will win in the end, but they expect that it will take a month or six weeks of intense debate and campaigning to defeat the isolationists. (October 23, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) - Landon, the Republican presidential candidate in 1936, visited Roosevelt yesterday to ask if he would participate in a third presidential election. "Scripps-Howard" newspaper reporter Simms interviewed Landon afterward, who said that President Roosevelt should issue a clear statement that he will not participate in a third election, and that he will not accept even if the Democratic Party nominates him as a candidate, as the greatest contribution the president can make under the current difficult and chaotic situation. Landon also said that he does not oppose President Roosevelt's Neutrality Act proposal if this bill can keep the United States out of war. However, if Roosevelt participates in a third election and causes the Democratic and Republican parties to abandon party politics, it would be unfair. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) - US Senator Pittman convened the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday for a so-called "tail-end" meeting to draft a bill to amend the Neutrality Act. The content is roughly the same as the President's proposal. Therefore, the debate over the Neutrality Act has begun, and the senators who support the amendment are gathering to discuss ways to abolish the arms embargo clause. Democratic Senator Clark, who has always opposed abolishing the embargo, is now confident that he is also among those "invited" to participate in the "tail-end" meeting. Clark is a well-known isolationist senator, and Pittman will hesitate if he insists on participating in the future. According to government sources, the "tail-end" meeting will draft a bill this week so that it can be submitted to the Foreign Relations Committee for discussion as soon as possible. According to statistics from the Associated Press, the opinions of senators on the amendment of the Neutrality Act are close to the government's. The following table shows a rough overview: Democratic Party, Republican Party, Other, Support Amendment, 45, 5, 1, Oppose Amendment, 10, 12, 3, Uncertain, 20. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hyde Park) - President Roosevelt again refused to comment on the issue of his participation in a third election last night. He also did not want to express any opinion on Landon's remarks before seeing the full text. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) - The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet on the 25th of this month to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment issue. Committee Chairman Pittman recently invited 14 Democratic Party members to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment he plans to propose. The content includes: (1) Abolishing the arms embargo clause; (2) Implementing "cash and carry" terms for all goods shipped to belligerent countries; (3) Prohibiting American ships from transporting goods to belligerents, with severe penalties for violators. This is stricter than the measures Pittman proposed in the previous session of Congress. It is generally said here that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has a total of 23 members, and Pittman has already invited 14, so there is little doubt that he will obtain a majority of votes in favor. In addition, Democratic Committee member Clark, who has always opposed the abolition of the arms embargo clause, was not invited to attend today. (October 23, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hyde Park, USA) - The New York World reported yesterday that a key Republican figure, namely Landon, the candidate in the last election, had suggested to President Roosevelt that he announce his intention not to run in the next year's election, and that Landon meant that the Republican and Democratic parties should eliminate their differences, but only on the condition that President Roosevelt does not run again. When the President arrived in this city today, a reporter asked him about this news, but the President refused to comment. (October 23, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) - Republican and isolationist figures have recently launched a nationwide committee to oppose President Roosevelt's proposal to repeal the arms embargo clause.

<h3>Pan-American Conference Opens; Panama President Delivers Opening Address</h3>
<p>(Panama City) - The Pan-American Conference opened here at 5 p.m. today. Representatives from all 21 republics of the Americas attended. The President of Panama, Arosemena, delivered the opening address, followed by the election of four committees: (1) Legal and Political Committee; (2) Economic Committee; (3) Neutrality Issues Committee; (4) Credentials Committee. It was also decided to convene a plenary session on the 25th of this month, with Panama's Foreign Minister Garay designated as chairman. According to well-informed sources here, the conference is scheduled to close on the 30th of this month. The following is a summary of President Arosemena's speech:</p>
<p>The President first stated that the Pan-American Conference, when held in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1936 and in Lima, Peru in 1938, stipulated that if a war occurred outside the Americas and threatened the peace of the Western Hemisphere, the American countries should immediately consult with each other. The convening of this conference is based on this stipulation. It is regrettable that less than a year has passed since the last conference in Lima, Peru, and this stipulation has been put into practice due to force of circumstances. At this time, what the American countries should show to the world is not only geographical unity, but also spiritual consistency. Various moral values have gradually disappeared, and Western civilization is declining daily. The responsibility for reversing this trend and preserving these values and this civilization for humanity should be borne by the American countries. Even if some American countries have adopted dictatorship, none has adopted imperialism or totalitarianism. No nation on the American continent is willing to follow a leader in adventurous actions to expand power or conquer mankind. This can be stated with certainty. (October 23, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Mexico City) - According to reliable sources, during the last European war, Germany opened a port in the Gulf of Mexico, near the port of Nautla in Veracruz province, which has now been rebuilt to serve as a submarine rendezvous center. Although Mexican authorities have denied this, unidentified submarines have indeed been found in the Gulf of Mexico. Shipping companies in Veracruz province have had to take various precautionary measures, painting the name of Mexico on both sides of all ships to avoid being mistaken. In addition, several private radio stations have been set up within Mexico to report various news to Germany. Mexican authorities have begun searching for them. (October 23, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Side Announces Strategy for Invading Poland</h3>
<p>(Berlin) - The High Command of the German Armed Forces issued the following statement last night: "The Polish war is over. The most intense battle was the battle on the Vistula River bank, defeating 1 million Polish troops, the majority of whom were captured. Only a few scattered units escaped to the eastern frontier. The entire Polish army now has only a few remnants stubbornly resisting in Warsaw, Modlin, and the Hel Peninsula. The reason they are able to do so is entirely because Germany wants to avoid unnecessary sacrifices for the Polish people. In the spring of this year, Germany, in view of Poland's attitude and its increasing reliance on foreign guarantees, which created a tendency to resolve German-Polish relations by force, studied Poland's intentions from its military measures and newspaper articles, and reached the following conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) Polish Strategy: Polish senior generals underestimated the strength of the German army, believing that Poland could take advantage of Germany's two-front war and launch a partial attack against it. Their planned strategy was to occupy Danzig and encircle East Prussia from three sides. Therefore, the troops were deployed as follows: A. Northern Route: North of Warsaw, its mission was to prevent the German army in East Prussia from moving south, while also advancing to attack it. B. Western Route: The Corridor troops, cooperating with the Northern Route to attack East Prussia and seize Danzig, and gathering a large army in Posen to provide support. C. Southern Route Defense Line: The Krakow-Lviv area. Polish senior generals believed that the troops in this area were sufficient to protect the industrial zone and could even invade the industrial area of Upper Silesia.</p>
<p>(2) German Strategy: The purpose of the German operational plan was to encircle a large number of Polish troops on the Vistula River bank and annihilate them there. Therefore, the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, General Brauchitsch, and the Chief of the General Staff, General Halder, decided to form northern and southern army groups. The Southern Army Group was commanded by General Rundstedt, with Lieutenant General Manstein as Chief of Staff. The Northern Army Group was commanded by General Bock, with General Salmuth as Chief of Staff. The Southern Army Group consisted of three armies: First Army Commander List, Second Army Commander Reichenau, and Third Army Commander Blaskowitz. The Northern Army Group consisted of two armies: Army Commanders Kluge and Küchler. The Southern Army Group's task was to advance towards the Vistula. General List led the First Army to push eastward from Upper Silesia. The Second Army, Reichenau, moved northeast. The Third Army, Blaskowitz, advanced from east of Breslau to besiege Warsaw, completing a large encirclement. The Northern Army Group was ordered to quickly establish contact with East Prussia and move south to support the Southern Army Group. The war unfolded gradually according to the original plan.

<p>(Bucharest, Romania) - The Romanian government authorities continued to purge members of the fascist Iron Guard yesterday in retaliation for the assassination of former Prime Minister Calinescu. It was previously reported that a total of 2,300 members had been killed, but it is now known that this was an exaggeration. However, at least 340 people were shot or "killed while trying to escape." Many people were arrested in various places yesterday, and the concentration camps are overcrowded. The Romanian government authorities have vaguely indicated that they intend to punish the families of the assassins. According to a statement last night, the Romanian Minister of the Interior has received countless letters questioning why the government has not punished the families of the assassins, but the statement did not mention future retaliation measures. According to the semi-official "Romanian Newspaper," "It is one of the government's duties to arrest troublemakers." (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Arms Issue: Supreme Defense Council Discussed Yesterday</h3>
<p>(London) - The British and French Supreme Defense Committee held a joint meeting in Britain yesterday, mainly discussing the adjustment of arms manufacturing industries on both sides. This is because the weapons needed by the French army are sufficient for domestic production, but assistance from Britain is needed to supply future allies. Diplomatic figures here said that although Poland has been defeated, Britain and France are still considering how to attract other countries to conclude alliance treaties with them in order to contain Germany in the east. However, as long as the current U.S. Neutrality Act is not amended, the allied countries can only purchase weapons from Britain and France. This is why the Supreme Defense Committee held a joint meeting yesterday to discuss this issue. (October 23, Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Franco-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>(Paris) - Political and diplomatic figures here are all pleased that Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sawada has been appointed as the ambassador to France, saying that the decision to fill the vacancy of the Japanese ambassador in a short period of time under the current international situation is of great significance. Once Ambassador Sawada arrives here to take office, various issues related to the two countries can be discussed in a good environment, thereby establishing closer relations. In addition, Ambassador Sawada served as a counselor at the Japanese Embassy in France for many years, is known for being pro-French, speaks French fluently, and is familiar with world affairs, so he is well-suited for the job.

This action by the British side will enable thousands of unemployed Japanese fishermen to regain "work". (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany and the Soviet Union Implement Policies in Occupied Polish Territory; Different Words, Different Methods; Polish People Still Determined to Restore Their Country</h3>
<p>(Paris) - A spokesman for the Polish Embassy in France told our reporter that the policies implemented by Germany and the Soviet Union in the occupied areas of Poland are completely different. The German method is to treat the Polish people as prisoners, using bayonets to force them to work. The Soviet Communists, on the other hand, have a completely opposite method. They first use communist propaganda on the Polish people to make them lean towards the Soviet Union. As for the Polish people, whether facing the German army or the Red Army, they all consider them invaders who have invaded Polish territory. To this day, they are still determined to drive these two enemies out of the country and restore their territory. And until now, the Polish troops between Warsaw and Modlin are still resisting the enemy's offensive. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Stockholm) - Since the Soviet Union invaded Poland, communism has spread. The Swedish newspapers are all using extremely anxious tones to expose this crisis. The Stockholm Daily News stated, "Three-quarters of Polish territory is being Bolshevikized by the Soviet Union, and it intends to stay there for a long time. The National Socialist regime has always claimed to be a defense against communism, but now it has opened the floodgates, allowing the flood to inundate the European continent. What we are witnessing is the first step of the Soviet Union's westward advance. Germany has handed over most of the Polish territory it conquered to the Soviet Union, showing that it is willing to continue to make goodwill concessions to the Soviet Union. It should be known that the day Germany is fully engaged in the Western war will be the day the Soviet Union can act freely in Eastern Europe. The dream of Pan-Slavism will become a reality, and Germany will no longer be able to oppose it." The Swedish Daily stated, "We still remember that on March 15 of this year, when the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia became German protectorates, Führer Hitler said that the Soviet Union intended to establish air bases in Czechoslovakia, so he placed Czechoslovakia under German protection, thereby protecting all of Europe. How could it be that only half a year has passed, and the Soviet Union has been able to build air bases in areas adjacent to the German border? We do not know how Germany will explain this. Moreover, the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland is under the pretext of liberating Slavic compatriots. The 8 million Czechs and 12 million Poles who have been incorporated into Germany hate Germany even more than they hate the Soviet Union, so the torch of Pan-Slavism is about to start a prairie fire."

<h3>Anti-German Movement in Czechoslovakia is Growing</h3>
<p>(Paris) - The official Czech news agency here announced yesterday that the Czech people's uprisings in Bohemia and Moravia are continuing to grow. The situation in the Pilsen area is particularly fierce. Workers at the Škoda factory have disarmed the police there and released all anti-Nazis who had been arrested.

<h3>Australia Decides to Send Troops to Europe to Aid the War</h3>
<p>(London) - The Information Department issued a communiqué stating that the Australian Federal Government has decided to send an expeditionary force, including four squadrons of bombers, two squadrons of fighter jets, and pilots, to Europe to aid the war. The structure and size of the expeditionary force are still under consideration. In addition, the Federal Government has taken various measures in the army and navy to replenish its forces. In addition to the complete mobilization of the Navy, army reservists will be called up for enlistment, so that an additional brigade can be formed to defend the country or be sent abroad.

<h3>Polish Government Prepares to Move to France; Soviets and Poles Detain Diplomats</h3>
<p>(Brussels) - Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Szembek arrived in Paris yesterday. Szembek is the first high-ranking Polish government official to arrive in France. Political figures in Paris claimed that Szembek's arrival in France is to make arrangements so that the Polish government will soon move to France. (October 24, Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) - According to well-informed sources, of the Soviet diplomats stationed in Poland, except for Ambassador Sharonov and the military attaché, who have arrived in Russia, the whereabouts of some other diplomats and consuls are unknown. The Soviet government has therefore decided not to allow Polish diplomats stationed in Russia to leave the country until the Polish diplomatic representatives and their families safely return to Russia.

<h3>United States Actively Manufacturing Aircraft</h3>
<p>(Los Angeles) - Although the current U.S. Neutrality Act does not allow the export of aircraft to belligerent countries, aircraft manufacturers here mostly believe that the current Neutrality Act will soon be amended. Therefore, aircraft factories are still processing and manufacturing aircraft. The aircraft hangars here are now full of new aircraft, so that when the Neutrality Act is amended, they can immediately provide for the needs of Britain and France. (October 24, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Problem with German Kerosene Supply</h3>
<p>(London) A certain military correspondent claims that, according to aviation experts here, the German army lost over 400 aircraft in Poland. This was due to the poor quality of the aircraft and the inefficiency of the pilots. The Soviet Union's occupation of Polish oil fields and the cutting off of the Romanian border have led to speculation about Germany's oil resources. German experts estimate that Germany needs 16 to 18 million tons of oil annually during wartime, but Germany itself can only extract 3 million tons of oil from coal each year. The Soviet Union has a high domestic oil demand, so it is doubtful whether it can supply Germany with large quantities. Therefore, there are rumors that Germany is preparing to invade Hungary, aiming for Romania's annual oil production of 7 million tons as its ultimate goal. However, the Soviet Union can move into Slovakia as a countermeasure. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Germany Restricts Food Purchases Again</h3>
<p>(Zurich, Switzerland) According to news received here, Germany will implement a new food purchasing system throughout the country from tomorrow.

The normal amount each person can purchase per week has been determined as follows: (1) Bread: 2 kilograms and 400 grams; (2) Meat: 500 grams; (3) Butter: 80 grams; (4) Butter substitutes: 120 grams; (5) Lard: 60 grams; (6) Cheese: 62 grams; (7) Jam: 100 grams; (8) Sugar: 250 grams. In addition, milk is only available for children. Potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and fish can be purchased freely. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>German-Belgian Trade Talks Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>(Beijing) According to news from here today, the trade talks between Germany and Belgium are proceeding smoothly. It is reported that Germany has agreed to continue supplying Belgium with the necessary goods as it did before the outbreak of the European war. As for what Belgium will supply to Germany in the future, Belgium is hesitant because it strictly adheres to neutrality. The prices of Belgian steel products for domestic needs have not increased, but the prices of exports have greatly increased. (American Guan News, 24th)</p>

<h3>Death of Famous Austrian Psychologist Sigmund Freud</h3>
<p>(London) Professor Sigmund Freud, the famous former Austrian psychologist, passed away last night at his residence in Hampstead due to illness, at the age of 83. Professor Freud was a leading figure in modern psychoanalysis and a former professor at the University of Vienna. He authored numerous works, many of which have been translated into various languages. His theory focuses on analyzing the human subconscious. Since the annexation of Austria by Germany last March, Freud, being Jewish, was not tolerated by the National Socialist Party, so he fled to England and settled in Hampstead, a suburb of London.

<h3>A Comparative View of the Two European Wars by Chen Chuxiang</h3>
<p>First, it must be stated that it has only been a little over twenty days since the outbreak of this European war. In this short period, Poland has collapsed, while the main forces of Britain, France, and Germany have just begun to engage. The Soviet Union's sudden entry into the war is also a major mystery. Trying to make a prophetic judgment on how it will change or what the outcome will be is simply self-deception. The purpose of this article is to briefly compare the brewing, outbreak, and initial military and diplomatic situation of the last European war with this European war. As for future developments, readers should speculate for themselves. History is recorded.</p>
<p>Everyone knows the cause of the last European war. It cannot be simply attributed to the assassination of the Crown Prince in Sarajevo. It should be traced back to the situation after the Franco-Prussian War. After France was defeated in 1870, its prestige plummeted. It was isolated due to the flexible diplomatic skills of Germany's Iron Chancellor Bismarck. At that time, Germany formed the Three Emperors League with Russia and Austria and the Triple Alliance with Austria and Italy. By revealing France's ambitions for Belgium and expressing Anglo-German friendship, Germany gained favor with Britain. As a result, Germany, while not dominating the European continent, certainly held an advantage. When Bismarck was forced to step down, Wilhelm II reversed his policies, causing Britain to be wary by competing in naval power and promoting the "Three B's" policy. He lost favor with Russia by helping Austria develop in the Balkans. Therefore, Britain, France, and Russia joined hands one after another, while Germany, apart from Austria, only had a nominally aligned Italy. Wilhelm was not alert to this and still wanted to fulfill his hegemonic ambitions. This conflicted with Britain's traditional policy of maintaining the balance of power in Europe, ultimately leading to the war. After the war, France, with the triumphant posture of a victorious nation, courted Belgium, Austria, the Little Entente, and the Baltic group to form its satellite groups. It also formed an alliance with Soviet Russia, completing the encirclement of Germany. On the surface, it seemed that France gradually had ambitions to dominate the European continent. In reality, France's goal focused only on passive defense because it was a victorious nation, a nation that "had," hoping to maintain the status quo. Its cooperation and mutual assistance with other countries were more about significance than manipulation, so it did not pose much of a threat to Britain. However, Britain still could not tolerate it. A distant example is opposing the French and Belgian occupation of the Ruhr. A recent example is condoning the rise of Hitler. Hitler's plan was written in "Mein Kampf." Britain was not unaware of it, but since Hitler came to power, rearming, militarizing the Rhineland, and annexing Austria, Britain always adopted an attitude of "keeping one eye open and one eye closed," at most issuing only a hollow protest. During the Sudetenland crisis in Czechoslovakia last autumn, the European situation became tense, with an atmosphere of "grass and trees all being soldiers." However, Chamberlain finally softened and personally flew to Germany to negotiate with Hitler. The Sudetenland merged with Germany. Soon after, the two issued a joint declaration, stating that disputes between the two countries would not be resolved by war. The "Non-Aggression Declaration" between France and Germany also followed. It was not until this spring, when all of Czechoslovakia fell, that the situation changed drastically. Chamberlain then keenly felt that Hitler's guarantees were untrustworthy and his ambitions insatiable. At that time, Lithuania was being threatened by Germany over the Memel issue, and Poland also had the possibility of invading Lithuania. In order to maintain its traditional policy of maintaining the balance of power on the European continent, Britain resolutely gave Poland a guarantee. At the same time, it also wanted to use the "Bear of the North Sea" (the Soviet Union) to deter Germany's eastern border. It sent a delegation to the Soviet Union with France to negotiate an alliance, but both sides were always suspicious of each other. As a result, after five months of negotiations, nothing was achieved. Instead, the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact suddenly came into existence like a bolt from the blue. Hitler then believed that he could be absolutely assured of the eastern border. His ambitions towards Poland became increasingly apparent. He used the Danzig issue as a pretext to take military action. If Britain and France tolerated this, Central and Southeastern Europe would fall entirely into German hands. Then, Germany might join forces with Italy and launch an attack westward or make colonial demands. Britain and France would find it even more difficult to deal with. Therefore, they had no choice but to fulfill their guarantee to Poland. After the German army invaded Polish territory and refused to withdraw, they declared war on Germany one after another.</p>
<p>On the surface, this is the cause of this European war. However, the British had long questioned, "Is the city of Danzig worth going to war for?" To say that Britain and France are truly fighting to uphold international justice and suppress aggressive evil deeds is as ridiculous as believing that Hitler is fighting to liberate German expatriates in Danzig. If Britain and France wanted to uphold international justice, why didn't they "draw their swords" when Austria and Czechoslovakia were being divided up, but delayed until now? While Hitler violated his promises, Britain also failed to fulfill its promises every time. Leaving aside the distant past, in recent times, the borders of Czechoslovakia after the cession of the Sudetenland were guaranteed by them. Why did they sit idly by and watch Czechoslovakia fall? In comparison, Hitler's words when he condemned Britain after hearing the British declaration of war can explain the cause of this war. He said that Britain, being located outside the European continent, always focused on maintaining the balance of power on the European continent. This led to the Anglo-Spanish, Anglo-Dutch, Anglo-French, and Anglo-German wars in the past. However, his words only told half the story. He did not explicitly state that he was pursuing a hegemonic policy, which disrupted the balance of power in Europe and caused the war. What Britain fears most is a country promoting a hegemonic policy on the European continent. Under this situation, Britain has no choice but to embark on the path of driving him back.

<h3>Tung Wah Association Wins First Match: 7-4 Victory over the Rangers, Leading 3-1 in the First Half, Wu Qixiang Active on the Forward Line</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was clear and the Yiyuan Stadium was lively again. Because of two good matches, no fewer than three thousand people came. Those who arrived early enjoyed the benefit of watching the first match for free. Tickets were not sold for the first match, and the gate was wide open. When the Tung Wah Association came on the field, the gate was closed, but it was impossible to ask those who had arrived early to leave. The Tung Wah Association, with the help of Wu Qixiang from Hong Kong, won the first match with a score of 7-4 against the Rangers, leading 3-1 in the first half.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Association:</p>

<p>In the first half, the Rangers kicked off and attacked. After five minutes, Wu Qixiang passed the ball to the center, and Dai Linjing took advantage of the goalkeeper's save and lightly pushed the ball under his arm. Tung Wah took the lead. The offensive was very strong for a while. Yu Qiaxing and Dai had a wonderful collaboration, but Dai kicked the ball slightly high, and it flew over the crossbar. On one occasion, Youliang made a wonderful cross, but Xue Niqing rushed to clear it out of bounds. Although the opportunities were good, they did not materialize. Then, the offensive shifted to the other side. Kaipusiding crossed the ball, and the landing point was excellent. Qin Bicao punched it out, showing his skill. Fafanxiao hooked the ball from the bottom line, and Qin caught it steadily. After eighteen minutes, Ajia shot and scored, making it 1-0. Tung Wah still had many good opportunities. Dai made a shot from eighteen yards, and Yu Qiaxing made a close-range hook, but both were blocked by Simmons. After twenty-six minutes, the Rangers found an opportunity to shoot. Fafanxiao shot from ten yards and scored, making it 2-1. After thirty-two minutes, Wu Qixiang received a wonderful pass from Youliang and headed the ball into the net, making it 3-1. Tung Wah took the lead.</p>
<p>In the second half, after the break, both sides made major changes to their lineups, forming the following formations:</p>
<p>Tung Wah Association:</p>
<p>Qin Bicao</p>

<p>Tung Wah's momentum was still strong, but because the front line had been changed, the movements were unfamiliar. The Rangers were in a similar situation, so the situation was still controlled by Tung Wah. After seven minutes, Youliang passed to Dai, and Dai pushed the ball in. Shen Shiyan gently kicked it in, completing the goal, making it 4-1. Youliang was trying out new shoes for the first time this season. He usually wears rubber shoes when practicing, so he wasn't very natural. On one occasion, he had a good opportunity, but he shot the ball into the goalkeeper's arms. After thirteen minutes, Tung Wah's misfortune struck. Yinggelan rushed into the penalty area and kicked the ball. Qin Bicao didn't catch it steadily, and it slipped in, making it 4-1. Half a minute later, Yinggelan, the former Liu Lang, went deep again, passing the ball to the right wing. Kaipusiding added a kick, and the ball bounced in from the top post, making it 4-3. Tung Wah lost two goals in half a minute. Then, Hongguang was adjusted back into the game, and the defense line returned to its position in the first half. Hu Hanwen was made right midfielder, and Wu Qixiang was transferred to left midfielder. The situation improved again. After eighteen minutes, Wan Jin shot, but it was saved. Shen Shiyan rushed to kick it in, making it 5-3. After twenty-six minutes, Dai passed to Ajia, and Youliang passed back to Linjing. Linjing kicked with his left foot from sixteen yards, creating another miracle, making it 6-3. After thirty minutes, Hu Er'en cut in, and Hong first committed a foul. Simmons took the penalty kick and scored, making it 6-4. In the last minute, Dai received a pass from Shen and pulled a shot from close range, completing the match with a score of 7-4. Tung Wah won the victory.</p>

<h3>Southwest Economic Construction</h3>
<p>— Fang Peixing</p>
<p>The only way for China's economic construction to advance is through decades of effort.  However, the results have not been significant for two reasons.  First, before the establishment of the National Government, although there was construction, there was no planning.  Second, after the establishment of the National Government, although there was planning, it was limited by internal and external troubles, and progress was still insufficient.  With the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the internal troubles have been alleviated, so in the past year or so, the government has been making unprecedented efforts in the economic construction of the whole country, especially the southwestern provinces.  In February, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang passed the "Production, Construction, and Control Plan for the Western Provinces." Later, our highest authorities also pointed out: "The western provinces are the source of our country's resistance," and explained that "only the development of transportation and economic construction in the Northwest and Southwest can provide a solid foundation for long-term resistance and national reconstruction. Only after the completion of the Northwest and Southwest transportation routes can the materials needed for our resistance and economic construction be fully supplied, without fear of shortages."</p>
<p>Therefore, since the government moved westward, it has been committed to completing the economic construction of the Southwest. In the past two years or so, the industries, finance, and transportation departments of the southwestern provinces have all made significant progress: such as the control of production and sales of local products such as Sichuan silk and tung oil, the commencement of the development of Kang and Yunnan gold mines, the accelerated construction of the Sichuan-Yunnan and Yunnan-Burma roads, the completion of the interprovincial highway network, and the unification of currencies in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan. These are all evident to all. Recently, the Southwest Economic Construction Commission and the Southwest Economic Construction Research Institute have been established to specialize in these matters, with unlimited prospects, further strengthening the people's belief that "the War of Resistance will surely be won, and the nation will surely be built."</p>
<p>Agriculture and Industry</p>
<p>The Central Agricultural Experiment Station has established five working stations in Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, and Yunnan to expand the promotion of rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, cotton, industrial crops, tung oil, walnuts, silk, tea, and animal husbandry. The Agricultural Promotion Committee cooperates as much as possible with the Agricultural Bank and the Central Agricultural Experiment Station in a vertical direction. On the one hand, it directly interacts with farmers to promote the development of agricultural affairs.</p>
<p>In terms of rural economy, under the planning of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Agricultural Bank, and with the assistance of the banking sector, each province has established cooperative business offices, designated loan areas, established farmers' associations, and organized agricultural warehouses for storage, mortgage lending. Some banks have also established agricultural departments, adopting long-term, low-interest, annual repayment methods to implement various rural loans.</p>
<p>As for industry, the Central Industrial Experiment Station has established eleven laboratories in Chongqing and other places. The Executive Yuan has allocated five million yuan to establish the China Industrial Cooperative Association, dividing the country into five working areas: one is the Sichuan-Kang area, with the office in Chongqing; the second is the Northwest area, with the office in Baoji; the third is the Southeast area, with the office in Ganzhou; the fourth is the Yunnan area, with the office in Kunming; and the fifth is the Southwest area, with the office in Shaoyang. The association has greatly benefited the relocation of factories and the improvement of industrial technology. No fewer than 300 industrial enterprises from the Southeast and Central regions have successively moved into Sichuan, Shaanxi, Hunan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. These factories are dispersed throughout the region, all with the central goal of strengthening national defense and increasing the power of resistance. With the assistance of the government, the industries that have moved from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Anhui, and other provinces to the Southwest include 22 machine factories, 10 chemical factories, 7 textile factories, 7 printing factories, 5 electrical factories, 3 ceramic factories, and other factories. In addition, there are also cement plants and paper mills newly established in Yunnan by Mr. Du Yuesheng and others, the Sichuan Alcohol Factory jointly operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Sichuan Provincial Government, the Wanxian Hydropower Plant, the Chongqing Oil Refinery, and the Southwest Trading Company and Huaxi Reclamation Company initiated and established by Mr. Chen Jiageng and others, with a capital of five million yuan each, planning to invest in the development of Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Qinghai, and Xinjiang provinces.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: The original text elaborated on transportation in great detail, which has been cut due to a separate article on the subject; apologies to the author.)</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>As the construction undertakings in the southwestern provinces flourished, the need for the assistance of the financial sector became more pressing. Industry and finance are mutually supportive and interdependent.</p>
<p>According to recent statistics, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and various commercial banks have established a total of 322 branches or offices in the Southwest: 81 in Guangdong, 48 in Guangxi, 59 in Hunan, 4 in Guizhou, 128 in Sichuan, and 11 in Yunnan. Eighteen banks have established 122 branches in the Southwest from other provinces, including 15 branches of the Central Bank of China, 27 branches of the Bank of China, 6 branches of the Bank of Communications, the Chinese Farmers Bank, 9 branches of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, 8 branches of the Yucheng Bank, 36 branches of the Zhongnan Bank, 3 branches each of the Guohua Bank, the Agricultural &amp; Commercial Bank, and the Salt Bank, 2 branches of the China National Products Bank, and 1 branch each of the Continental Bank, the China Agricultural &amp; Industrial Bank, the New China Savings &amp; Trust Bank, the Jianghai Bank, the Dafu Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the Overseas Chinese Bank, and the Sihai Bank. The central points are Changsha, Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, Guilin, and Wuzhou.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The above are just a few of the major points. From this, it is sufficient to prove that the economic construction of the Southwest is in constant progress. The inland production that had stagnated for hundreds of years before the War of Resistance has unexpectedly flourished in the two years after the war. This can be said to be a miracle, and it is also driven by the circumstances of the times. From this, we can know that a semi-feudal and semi-colonial China must wait until it obtains national independence, civil rights equality, and improvement of people's livelihood before it can talk about developing the entire national economy.</p>
<h3>China's Transportation Construction</h3>
<p>— Tang Xiaoyun</p>
<p>It has been more than two years since the War of Resistance began. What is the status of transportation construction in the southwestern and northwestern provinces during this long process? Everyone who cares about the War of Resistance and national reconstruction is eager to know. Although newspapers and magazines occasionally report on this issue, most are biased towards one province or one region. There are few comprehensive discussions on China's transportation construction during the war. The author will present what he knows to the readers.</p>
<h3>International Transportation Lines</h3>
<p>A. Railways and Highways</p>
<p>Currently, there are the following three railways and highways that can handle the transportation of military supplies from abroad and strengthen the power of resistance:</p>
<p>The original Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. This railway starts from Haiphong in French Indochina, passes through Hanoi and Lao Cai on the Yunnan border, and reaches Kunming. It is currently the most important international transportation line.</p>
<p>The newly built Yunnan-Burma Highway. This road starts from Kunming, passes through Xiaguan near Dali, and turns into Lashio in Burma. The total length is 716 miles. From Lashio, there is a railway directly to Yangon, which is 630 miles long. This transportation line, with a total length of 1,346 miles, in addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, can be said to undertake a huge task in international transportation.</p>
<p>The greatest China-Soviet Highway in the Northwest. This road starts from Xi'an, crosses Gansu's Pingliang, Lanzhou, Jiuquan, Jiayuguan, and reaches Xinjiang's Hami, Dihua, Tacheng, to the Semipalatinsk Station on the Turkestan-Siberian Railway in Soviet Central Asia. The total length is 4,391 kilometers.</p>
<p>In addition, the following international transportation lines are being actively planned and constructed:</p>
<p>Guilin-Vietnam Line: This road starts from Yining, passes through Longjin (formerly known as Longzhou), Zhennanguan, and reaches Lang Son in Annam to reach Hanoi. The length is 258 kilometers, with 150 kilometers within China. The construction cost of this road is 12 million yuan. It has been surveyed that the section from Yining to Zhennanguan will be built by French investment, and the automobile road is now being laid along the line to prepare for the transportation of building materials. As an important trunk line for international transportation in the Southwest, the Ministry of Transportation is currently setting a deadline for its completion.</p>
<p>Yunnan-Burma Line: This line connects the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, starting from Kunming, passing through Dali and Tengchong, and reaching Lashio in Burma. The total length is more than 700 kilometers. The construction cost is about 60 million yuan. Recently, our government has reached an agreement with the British government to use a portion of the Sino-British loan to cover the construction costs. The line has also been surveyed and is under construction, using the Yunnan-Burma Highway as the basic route for transporting materials. After the completion of this road, it can reach Yangon and reach Southeast Asia and Europe. It also occupies a very important position in foreign transportation lines.</p>
<p>Xinjiang-Hai Line: This is the general term for the extension of the Longhai Railway to Xinjiang. After the completion of this road, it can connect to the Soviet Highway from Tacheng and Weitangzi to reach the Inland Railway in the Soviet Union, and then to Moscow and various parts of Europe. This road is the only way to closely link China and the Soviet Union, which must be built as soon as possible. It is said that the road is currently being planned and constructed.</p>
<p>B. Air Routes</p>
<p>Before the war, China's international air routes included six main lines: Hong Kong-Hanoi Line, Chongqing-Hong Kong Line, Shaanxi-Hong Kong Line, Kunming-Hong Kong Line, Guangdong-Hanoi Line, and Guangdong-Hanoi-West Line. After the war, because the original routes were insufficient, the following three international direct air routes were added:</p>
<p>China-Burma Route: It was originally scheduled to open in March this year, but the formal opening was delayed due to weaknesses found during the test flight. According to reports, the line has now officially opened.</p>
<p>China-Vietnam Route: The China Aviation Company of the Ministry of Transportation previously discussed with the French airline to open the Chongqing-Hanoi line between China and Vietnam. After obtaining the consent of the French side, a preliminary test flight was made on the morning of March 8 this year, and then the route was officially opened.</p>
<p>China-Soviet Route: This line starts from Chongqing, passes through Gansu and Xinjiang, and reaches Alma-Ata on the Turkestan-Siberian Railway in the Soviet Union, and then reaches Moscow. The official opening was also realized early. As for other routes, they are currently being actively prepared.</p>
<p>Domestic Transportation Lines</p>
<p>Domestic transportation lines can be divided into five categories: railways, highways, aviation, waterways, and telecommunications. The current construction situation of each item is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>A. Railways</p>
<p>In the ten provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in the Southwest and Northwest, the total population is about 100 million, and the land area is 4.92 million square kilometers. However, there are only a few sections such as the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the Tongguan-Xi'an section of the Longhai Railway, the Xi'an-Douji section, and the Ge Bi Shi section. The total length is only 900 kilometers. The government, in view of the fact that the development of the rich resources of the Southwest and Northwest is related to the heavy freight and military transportation, which cannot be undertaken by the railway that bears the heavy load and reaches far, so under the active progress, the following railways have been completed and opened to traffic, and are being built and planned:</p>
<p>Chengdu-Chongqing Railway: From Chengdu to Chongqing, the total length is 523 kilometers, and the construction cost is 15 million yuan. In addition to forming the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company, the government collected a capital of 30 million yuan and borrowed 24.5 million yuan from the French banking group. The road started construction in mid-February of the year before last and is now officially open to traffic.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Yunnan Railway: From Xufu, Sichuan to Kunming, Yunnan, the total length is 1,170 kilometers, which is contracted by the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway Company. The following have been completed: the section from Xinjin to Wutongqiao, which is 142 kilometers long; the section from Wei to Qingshuixi, which is 15 kilometers long; and the section from Jiangmenchang to Xuyong, which is 10 kilometers long.</p>
<p>Hunan-Guangxi Railway: Starting from Hengyang Station on the Yuehan Railway, passing through Dulin, Liuzhou, Yining, Longzhou, to Zhennanguan on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam, and connecting to the branch line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the total length is 950 kilometers. It is built in four sections: the first section is Hengyang-Guilin, the second section is Guilin-Liuzhou, the third section is Liuzhou-Yining, and the fourth section is Yining-Zhennanguan. The Heng-Gui section, which is 300 kilometers long, requires a construction cost of 36 million yuan and was opened to traffic on October 1 last year after one and a half years of work. The remaining three sections are scheduled to be completed in the winter of this year.</p>
<p>Baoji-Chengdu and Douji-Lanzhou Railways: After the Longhai Railway reached Douji, there are two routes to the west and south: the route to the west aims at Lanzhou, and the route to the south ends at Chengdu. The government believes that the economic value of the Dou-Cheng line is greater, and it is also the main connection line between the two major railway systems in the Northwest and Southwest, so it decided to build it first. The road is about 500 kilometers long, and the construction cost is 50 million yuan. It has been prepared from the Belgian bank and will start construction soon. As for the Lanzhou line, it will be built immediately after the completion of the Baoji-Chengdu line.</p>
<p>Hunan-Guizhou Railway: The total length is about 1,000 kilometers, and the construction and equipment costs are about 160 million yuan; from Zhuzhou, it reaches Guiyang via Xiangtan, Xiangxiang, Xinhua, and Zhijiang. The section from Zhuzhou to Xiangxiang has been completed.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Guizhou Railway: Starting from Chengdu, passing through Chongqing, Chongxihe, Songkan, Tongzi, and reaching Guiyang. The total length of the entire line is about 979 kilometers and it has been opened to traffic.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Shaanxi Railway: Starting from Chengdu, passing through Xindu, Guanghan, Deyang, Luojiang, Mianyang, Zitong, Jiange, Zhaohua, Guangyuan, and ending at Ningqiang, Shaanxi. The section from Mianyang to Ningqiang, which is about 412 kilometers long, has been opened to traffic; this section is under rush repair.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Hubei Railway: Starting from Jianyang Station, passing through Lezhi, Suining, Lianxi, Nanchong, Yuechi, Guang'an, Quxian, Dazhu, Liangshan, Wanxian, crossing the Yangtze River and reaching Lichuan in Hubei Province. The total length of the road is 809 kilometers, and the Jianyang-Quxian section, which is 470 kilometers long, has been opened to traffic; the section from the watershed to Wanxian, which is 45 kilometers long, has also been completed.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Xikang Railway: Starting from Chengdu, passing through Shuangliu, Xinjin, Qionglai, Mingshan, Ya'an, Tianquan, Luding, and reaching Kangding, the total length is 373 kilometers. The section from Chengdu to Ya'an, which is 173 kilometers long, is now open to traffic; the section from Ya'an to Kangding is under rush construction.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Guizhou Railway: This road starts from Tongyang on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road, passes through Zhangming, Jiangyou, Pingwu, Songpan, and reaches Qinghai via Suge Tibetan Temple; the total length is 552 kilometers. The section from Mianyang to Jiangyou, which is 53 kilometers long, has been opened to traffic.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Gansu Railway: Starting from Zhaohua Station on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Road, passing through Baoningyuan and reaching Bikou in Gansu Province; the total length is about 100 kilometers, and it is also under planning and construction.</p>
<p>In addition, the government also plans to build the Baotou-Lanzhou Line, the Gansu-Xinjiang Line, and the Ningxia-Qinghai Line, with Lanzhou in the Northwest as the center. Once the above-mentioned railway network is completed, the Northwest and Southwest provinces can be connected as one.</p>
<p>B. Highways</p>
<p>According to the report of the Ministry of Transportation last year: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, more than 1,600 kilometers of new lines have been built and 1,622 kilometers of old lines have been repaired in the southwestern and northwestern provinces. This is the number for last year, and it is obviously not suitable for the present. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Prospects for Japan's Shipping Industry During the War</h3>
<p>— Li Shumin</p>
<p>(6) South American West Coast Line: From Hong Kong via Japan, Honolulu, San Francisco, down the west coast of the Americas to Valparaíso, Chile. Once a month.</p>
<p>(7) South American East Coast Line: From Japan via Hong Kong, Singapore, across the Indian Ocean, around the Cape of Good Hope, across the South Atlantic to Argentina and Brazil on the east coast of South America. Once a month.</p>
<p>(8) China Express Line: From Shanghai via Nagasaki to Kobe. Once every four days. This line has about two 5,000-ton giant ships traveling back and forth, taking 26 hours.</p>
<p>Looking at the above eight lines, one can get a general idea:</p>
<p>Japan also relies on other countries for imports of wartime raw materials and food (such as olive oil, rubber, iron, rice, cotton, etc.). If the war prevents imports, Japan will inevitably panic. In addition, the lessons learned from the UK in the previous Great War; in view of this, Japan will more actively take the same measures as the UK to exert its power in the Pacific theater and hope that its shipping commerce will expand to the East Indies, Southeast Asia, and North America. According to a famous Japanese commentator, Japan's shipping commerce in the year before last was as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To the Asian continent, north of Hong Kong - 19%</p>
<p>(2) To the Asian continent, south of Hong Kong (including Hong Kong) - 18%</p>
<p>(3) To the East Indies, Philippines, etc. - 11.5%</p>
<p>(4) To North and South America - 33%</p>
<p>(5) Others such as Singapore - 18.5%</p>
<p>The commentator hinted: During the war, 48% of the commerce will be cut off from the UK, and that 48% does not yet include the Americas and the northern part of the Asian continent.</p>
<p>During the last Great War, the UK blockaded its enemies in the depths of the ocean, so the commercial operations of the invaders were almost non-existent. However, this is the opposite for Japan, whose commerce can extend thousands of miles away, which is unbelievable. It can also eliminate or blockade the commercial aggression of various powerful countries and pay attention to commercial transportation under the protection of new cruisers. Therefore, the map of its shipping commerce expanded greatly during the last Great War. This can be confirmed by the following distances:</p>
<p>(1) Japan to Korea… 120 miles</p>
<p>(2) Japan to Shanghai… 470 miles</p>
<p>(3) Japan to San Francisco… 4,760 miles</p>
<p>(4) Japan to Mexico… 6,9[missing digit(s)]</p>
<p>If Japan's shipping commerce hopes to exist during the war, cruisers must be manufactured in large quantities, and according to an expert, each ship must weigh 300,000 tons. Because commercial activity during the war cannot be maintained thousands of miles away without cruisers. The original need was mostly used for the waterways between Japan and Korea and Shanghai, and then gradually expanded to Europe and England. According to Japan, maintaining its shipping commerce so that other countries can continuously supply raw materials and maintain its inherent export goods in order to stabilize the domestic economic situation was originally its two major wartime economic problems, and the solution to these two problems depends entirely on the contribution of cruisers. Therefore, cruisers will also be manufactured without limit, which cannot be limited by the 5:5:3 ratio.</p>
<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Gang Absorbs, Cooked Gold Rises 30 Yuan; Jewelry Gold and Pure Gold Needles Change</h3>
<p>Cooked Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot market conditions for cooked gold were without formal trading due to the Sunday holiday. However, outside the exchange, initially affected by the weak sentiment from the evening before, the price briefly fell to 4,080 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money exchange firm strongly absorbed (reportedly entrusted by Hong Kong and local gangs), raising the price to 4,135 yuan. By midday, the situation had stabilized somewhat. The selling price at money exchange firms was quoted at 4,130 yuan, and the buying price was around 4,120 yuan, an increase of about 30 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold</p>
<p>The selling prices of gold jewelry at jewelry stores remained unchanged. Da Tong Heng and Xin Tong Heng both maintained the price of 415 yuan per tael, unchanged from the original price. The buying price was reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch on the 23rd, British pure gold remained at £8 8s per ounce.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: A Batch of Rough Blue Sugar Has Arrived</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was slightly tight. The association's opening price for spot raw white sugar outside the warehouse was initially 53.5 yuan, then rose to 54.5 yuan, an increase of one yuan. Taikoo Che Bai (Western Machine B Mark) was 97.5 yuan to 58.5 yuan, up 5 jiao. DY Mark (East Warehouse) was 56.2 yuan, HX Mark was 55 yuan, H Mark (Car Red) was 42 yuan, Dutch Red was 43 yuan, and there was not much change for the rest. A batch of domestic rough blue sugar has arrived, but the quantity is unknown.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Sophora Japonica Rises Again by 2-3 Yuan</h3>
<p>The current arrival of Sophora japonica is scarce, and the land price is quite firm, so the Shanghai market has risen again. Ordinary goods have risen to 28-29 yuan, and high-quality goods are 37 yuan, an increase of another 2-3 yuan compared to before. The future market is still expected to tighten further.</p>
<h3>Seafood: White Pepper Stabilizes, Black Pepper Drops by 4-5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Pepper prices have recently stabilized, and group traders have even withdrawn, so black pepper has dropped by 4-5 yuan. No. 1 pepper is 116 yuan, large black pepper is 115 yuan, and white pepper is stable, still priced at 140 yuan to 135 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tapioca Starch Arrives Sparsely, Pricey; Sago Also Rises by More Than 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Tapioca Starch: Due to the long-term lack of supply, the market stock is becoming increasingly scarce, so the trading price has risen again. Currently, Flying Unicorn is selling for 40 yuan, up 4 yuan. KG Mark and Three X Mark are both selling for 39 yuan, up 5 yuan. Double T Mark is 35 yuan, up 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Sago: Yesterday's market price was more than 10 yuan higher than in mid-July. Large grains are 38 yuan, and small grains are 35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Stockpilers Cut Prices and Sell; White Coal Trading is Active</h3>
<p>After the price increase of Haifeng White Coal the day before yesterday, business was very quiet during the off-season. However, recently, a certain warehouse in Shanghai West, due to its location in a cross-border area and environmental factors, various stockpilers had to cut prices and sell, reducing the price by 3-4 yuan from the new price of 126 yuan to secure profits. Street customers also took the opportunity to absorb the coal, and trading became active, with daily transactions among fellow traders reaching 300-400 tons.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Unified Pinellia Tuber Price Difficult to Rise</h3>
<p>Several packages of unified Pinellia tuber were opened, with a price of 125 yuan. Recently, it was heard that a certain shop still has five or six packages in stock, planning to sell them for 130 yuan. Both trading parties are negotiating, but no deal has been reached yet.</p>

<h3>Contributions from All Sectors, Belief in Resistance and National Construction Grows Stronger, Rumors Subside, Foreign Exchange Rate Achieves New Level, Bank of China's Legal Price Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai market was rife with peace rumors, and the prices of gold in the black market, cotton yarn, and government bonds experienced intense fluctuations. Subsequently, the central government strongly refuted the baseless rumors and reiterated its determination to resist the war and build the nation. These rumors then began to dissipate.</p>
<p>Gold and Cash Donations are Extremely Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The determination of citizens from all sectors in this city to resist the war and build the nation is growing stronger. The Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank, which are acting as agents for the collection of gold and cash donations, receive citizens who come to exchange and donate every day. Many people also specify the use of their donations, and their enthusiasm is admirable. As for the exchange of gold, the public is willing to exchange it for cash at the Bank of China's listed gold price, which is commendable. According to a statement from a Bank of China official yesterday, although the number of people going to the Bank of China to exchange gold and donate cash is not very large, people from all walks of life are represented. The amount of gold exchanged and cash donated is not yet planned to be announced.</p>
<p>Legal Foreign Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is striving to stabilize foreign exchange rates to maintain the external value of the legal currency. Since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, the foundation of foreign exchange across the country has become more solid. The legal foreign exchange rate announced by the Central Bank every day remains unchanged, and foreign exchange is supplied as much as possible for the import of essential goods for various industries.</p>
<p>Black Market Exchange Rate Forms a New Level</p>
<p>As for the Shanghai black market foreign exchange, it is now entirely manipulated by speculators. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has decided not to maintain it and will let it take its natural course. Since the outbreak of the European war, those who own foreign exchange panicked and sold it off. The foreign exchange market here showed a very strong upward trend, but within a few days, the feeling of fear subsided, and the exchange rate still hovered between 3.5 to 4 "ban shi." Therefore, when the current exchange rate falls below 3.5 "ban shi," it encounters strong resistance. On the other hand, it is not permitted by the environment to rise above 4 "ban shi." It seems to have become a "natural level."</p>
<p>Speculation and Rumors are Not Credible</p>
<p>Therefore, speculators cannot profit greatly and deliberately spread rumors to cause drastic fluctuations in the market, such as the peace rumors and the issuance of foreign exchange certificates that occurred recently. Now it has been confirmed that the rumors circulating in the market are completely without basis. However, various new rumors are still prevalent in the market. Therefore, fluctuations in the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange are in fact difficult to avoid, but the price in this black market for foreign exchange is no longer sufficient to represent the status of the legal currency.</p>
<h3>Soviet Consul Leaves Shanghai for Japan</h3>
<p>Due to Political Developments, He is Transferred Elsewhere, and Will Soon be Replaced by Someone Else</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reports that the Soviet Consul in Shanghai, Konstantinov, along with a secretary from the consulate, left Shanghai for Japan yesterday (the 23rd) aboard the *Shanghai Maru*. It is said that these two officials have been transferred elsewhere due to recent political developments and will be replaced by others in mid-October. The consulate secretary, Kolomitsev, is currently in charge of everything. It is reported that the Soviet consulate just moved to its official building at 20 Huangpu Road from its temporary premises on Avenue Edward VII at the end of this week.</p>
<h3>Pretexting the European War, White Coal is Hoarded</h3>
<p>Manufacturers are Extremely Anxious, Various Industries are Affected</p>
<p>When foreign exchange shrank frequently last month, coal merchants hoarded Indian coal and secretly collected and hoarded coal from a certain country, causing the market situation to change suddenly. They then took the opportunity to raise the price of coal without any bill of exchange relationship from more than 30 yuan per ton to more than 50 yuan suddenly, and then gradually raised it to more than 80 yuan, causing market disorder. Recently, under the pretext of the European war, they have collected and hoarded white coal, resulting in a shortage of fuel for several factories and a lack of goods to buy. The price of coal balls is also rising several times a day, and various manufacturers are extremely anxious.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond the Settlement are Reported to the Consular Body for Handling, Thugs Rampant in Caojiadu, Western Shanghai, Public Bus Driver Kidnapped</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Municipal Council has reported the progress of negotiations on road construction beyond the settlement to the Consular Body. Because major administrative events concerning the International Settlement must be discussed by the Consular Body and reported to the governments of the relevant countries before a final decision can be made. Before the Consular Body comes up with a solution, the Municipal Council will do its utmost to safeguard its rights and interests. However, the Japanese-puppet side is adopting a nibbling attitude and constantly encroaching, so a confrontation between police and puppet police has formed in the area of road construction beyond the settlement, and the tense situation remains unabated.</p>
<p>Thugs Kidnap Driver in Broad Daylight</p>
<p>Wujiaochang in Caojiadu, western Shanghai, is the terminus of the No. 10 public bus line. Yesterday at 4:45 PM, a No. 31 bus on the No. 10 line was approaching the entrance of the Daxin Photo Studio when nine thugs in plain clothes, mostly wearing blue short trousers and jackets, suddenly stepped forward and ordered the driver of the bus, No. 390, to get out of the vehicle. When the driver refused, the thugs drew out their Mauser pistols to threaten him. The more than 20 passengers in the bus looked at each other in dismay and fled when the bus stopped. The driver was forced to get out of the bus and was taken away by the thugs to the west. When the incident occurred, nearby police and puppet police looked at each other without intervening. The reason for the kidnapping is unknown.</p>
<p>Ten Puppet Police Stations Have Already Been Established</p>
<p>Japanese and puppet military and police have encroached upon the area of road construction beyond the settlement, attempting to seize police power and actively expanding the establishment of puppet police stations in the area. According to an on-the-spot investigation by a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency, there are puppet police stations at the following locations: (1) Lane in Da Xi Road, (2) Zhu Jia Zhai in Da Xi Road, (3) Intersection of Da Xi Road and Columbia Road, (4) Zhu An Long in Yidingpan Road, (5) Opposite Anle Factory in Bailinan Road, (6) Western End of Triangle Field in Route des Soeurs, (7) Eastern End of Jiaozhou Road in Robison Road, (8) Opposite the China Light Bulb Factory in Robison Road, (9) Jin Situ Temple in Route des Soeurs, (10) Intersection of Connaught Road and Singapore Road. The above ten locations all belong to the "Western District Branch" of the puppet police at the intersection of Route des Soeurs and Route Kener.</p>
<h3>Cotton Shipped to Shanghai is Detained, Negotiations are Underway</h3>
<p>A large batch of cotton shipped from Beisha to Shanghai was detained by the Japanese at the Waterside Hotel. Because yesterday was a weekly holiday, the owners of the goods must wait until today to conduct negotiations. More than 1,000 bales of cotton shipped from Beisha to Shanghai on the Wulin and Jiangding vessels two days ago have been safely withdrawn from the bank and stored in warehouses by the owners.</p>
<h3>Li Ruzhang, Executive of the Refugee Children's Education Institute, Assassinated, Attacked While Seeing Guests off at the Tianchan Theater Yesterday, One Bullet Hit a Vital Point and He Died</h3>
<p>A shooting occurred in front of the Tianchan Theater at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Yunnan Road at approximately 12:40 PM yesterday. The victim was Li Ruzhang, the executive director of the Refugee Children's Education Institute in this city. The case is confusing, and there are conflicting reports. The details of what happened are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Broadcasting and Fundraising for New Institute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute was established last winter. Its address is No. 9, Lane 78, Avenue Joffre and Rue du Père Robert, French Concession. It houses 500 refugee children, with Yuan Lidun as chairman and Chen Jicheng as director, and Li Ruzhang as the institute's executive director. Thanks to the enthusiastic donations of philanthropists from all walks of life, it has achieved remarkable results. Because the original site was too small, another site was built at No. 99, Lane 258, Wuding Road, International Settlement. Yesterday, on the occasion of the completion of the new site, a broadcasting program was specially held at six radio stations in this city, including Tianchan, Zhongxi, Zhongmei, Xindu, Commercial, and Xinsheng, to encourage the adoption of refugee children and raise funds for the construction of workshops.</p>
<p>Suddenly Shot While Seeing Guests into a Car</p>
<p>Li Ruzhang was responsible for reception and general reporting at the Tianchan Radio Station. He was wearing a suit and glasses and worked very hard. Around 12:30 PM, after the speech by a certain gentleman, Li rose to thank him on behalf of the institute and escorted him downstairs to his car. Unexpectedly, as the guest was stepping into the car and about to leave, gunshots suddenly rang out near the entrance of the station, with two shots fired in quick succession. At that time, the guest car had already started its engine and sped away. Li suddenly fell to the ground after the gunshots. The assassin, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled into the crowd and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Critically Wounded in the Abdomen and Died</p>
<p>Although nearby police officers immediately searched, the assassin had disappeared. The information was reported to the police station in charge, which dispatched detectives to search and investigate. The Tianchan Theater was suddenly closed temporarily for a thorough search, but there were no results. Li Ruzhang was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was discovered that Li had been shot once in the back, the bullet entering the abdomen and exiting from the front, and because of excessive bleeding, his condition was extremely critical. The hospital doctors tried their best to rescue him, but unfortunately, the injury was too severe and in a vital area, and he died of his injuries in the hospital at approximately 2:00 PM that afternoon. His body has been sent to the morgue and will be reported to the court for inspection this morning before being transferred to the Leyuan Funeral Home on Jundunxin Road. The funeral will be held tomorrow afternoon, and the affairs will be handled by the colleagues of the education institute.</p>
<p>Former County Magistrate Now Runs Charity</p>
<p>Li Ruzhang was a native of Jiaxing, Zhejiang, and was 52 years old. He was upright, determined, and exceptionally chivalrous towards his friends. He served as the secretary of the Business Section of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the county magistrate of Jiaxing County, and the military law officer of the 26th Army. In 1927, he began to organize education and established Ximen Primary School. After the August 13th Incident, he was deeply moved by the suffering of refugee children and strove to establish the education institute. After several months of hard work, he succeeded in the end, and his contribution was very great. At that time, only 27 refugee children were admitted. Li's residence was at No. 203, Rue Saussure, French Concession, and his wife also lives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Rice Stabilization Program Has Completely Ended, 8,059.19 Shi of Tribute Rice Sold, Totaling More Than 161,000 National Currency, The Second Rice Stabilization Program Will Be Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>The four Tribute Rice Stabilization Program locations have sold off the daily allocation of 7,000 bags of good tribute rice, which was completely sold out the day before yesterday. Yesterday, each rice stabilization location continued to sell broken rice for one day, thus ending the program. A total of 8,059.19 shi of tribute rice was sold in the two settlements, yielding a total of more than 161,183.8 yuan in national currency. The second rice stabilization program has been temporarily postponed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Four Rice Stabilization Locations Have Already Closed</p>
<p>The five tribute rice locations in the British and French concessions, except for the first location at the intersection of North Henan Road and Lao Bazhi Road, which closed on the 20th of this month, the four locations including the second and third locations in the International Settlement and the fourth and fifth locations in the French Concession, have sold off the daily allocation of 7,000 bags of good tribute rice, which was completely sold out the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they continued to sell broken rice for one day, a total of 1,000 bags, 250 bags per location, all of which were sold by 3:00 PM yesterday. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited the four rice stabilization locations in the British and French concessions yesterday. According to the persons in charge of each location, the 1,000 bags of broken rice were of very good quality and very dry, so the common people who bought this broken rice were all very happy. It has been decided to close today. As for the third location (Yufosi Temple on Binlang Road), all the used items were transferred to the Rice Merchants Association yesterday.</p>
<p>Rice Stabilization Statistics Are Largely Completed</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Zhang Nianxuan, the chairman of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, yesterday. According to Zhang, the rice stabilization locations have achieved remarkable results since the beginning and can be closed. The rice stabilization statistics are as follows: The first location sold rice for four days, a total of 959.78 shi, selling 18,900 1-dou tickets, 1,200 5-sheng tickets, and 489 2-sheng tickets, totaling 19,195.6 yuan in national currency. The second location sold rice for seven days, a total of 1,985.69 shi, selling 15,900 1-dou tickets, 7,781 5-sheng tickets, and 332 2-sheng tickets, totaling 39,713.8 yuan in national currency. The third location sold rice for seven days, a total of 1,728.3 shi, selling 15,763 1-dou tickets, 3,000 5-sheng tickets, and 100 2-sheng tickets, totaling 34,566 yuan in national currency. The fourth location sold rice for seven days, a total of 1,753.82 shi, selling 12,000 1-dou tickets, 10,990 5-sheng tickets, and 216 2-sheng tickets, totaling 35,076.4 yuan in national currency. The fifth location sold rice for seven days, a total of 1,631.6 shi, selling 12,200 1-dou tickets, 7,272 5-sheng tickets, and 2,400 2-sheng tickets, totaling 32,632 yuan in national currency. In total, the five locations sold rice for 32 days. The three locations in the International Settlement sold a total of 4,673.77 shi of rice, and the two locations in the French Concession sold a total of 3,385.42 shi of rice. The five locations in the two settlements sold a total of 8,059.19 shi of good tribute rice, selling a total of 64,763 1-dou tickets, 30,243 5-sheng tickets, and 3,537 2-sheng tickets, for a total of 161,183.8 yuan in national currency. All of the above funds have been turned over to the designated bank. In addition, yesterday's sale of broken rice collected 16,578.8 yuan. It is reported that there are still residual rice and rotten rice at each location, which are still being settled. This rice stabilization program was for the service of the common people, so the measuring of rice could not be too strict, but across the four locations, the loss was only about 3 sheng per shi.</p>
<p>The Second Rice Stabilization Program Will Be Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>Regarding the second rice stabilization program, after consultations between various groups and the committee members of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, it was decided to postpone it temporarily. According to Mr. Zhang Nianxuan, the chairman of the Rice Merchants Association, speaking to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday, the first rice stabilization program will end today, but the 8,000 bags of Saigon rice in the first program were only a drop in the bucket and of no help. Fortunately, the directors of each location commanded properly, and the authorities of the two settlements sent police to protect and maintain order. However, the second rice stabilization program is highly anticipated and is deeply hoped to be realized. After consultation, it has been decided to postpone it temporarily, but the reasons are as follows: (1) Because the amount of national rice shipped to Shanghai has increased sharply, hoarders have disappeared, and rice prices have begun to fall; (2) New goods have already entered the market in rice-producing areas such as Wuhu, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Changshu, and Kunshan, and may be shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream in the short term; (3) The rice market has turned to clear sales, and large households have a considerable amount of rice stored up, and various groups have jointly ordered foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai for adjustment; (4) The autumn harvest is approaching, and the grains are abundant. Rice merchants are afraid of unexpected losses and have lowered prices for sale, so the entire Shanghai food supply is not threatened by a shortage, and prices are tending to fall. Moreover, it is quite difficult to carry out the rice stabilization program.</p>
<p>The No. 1 District North of the Suzhou Creek Remains Peaceful After the Change of Defense, But Residents are Forced to be Injected, Japanese Troops Patrol Regularly</p>
<p>The situation in the No. 1 district north of the Suzhou Creek, from North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, after the change of defense lines between the British and Japanese, and the Japanese troops began to take over the defense of the area, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The continued situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Patrol Regularly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the number of sentries posted by the Japanese troops in front of the Shanghai Telephone Company at the western intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road was increased to two. There are still no Japanese troops stationed at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Lao Bazhi Road. The Railway Hospital at the western end of the road has not yet been occupied by the Japanese troops and remains as it was. However, Japanese troops regularly send patrols within the area they have taken over.</p>
<p>Residents are Forced to be Injected</p>
<p>There are many local residents waiting for injections around the injection station under the canvas shed set up by the Japanese in front of the Shanghai Telephone Company at the western intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road. These people must line up when entering the shed and proceed in order from the west side of the Shanghai Telephone Company. There are many women mixed in the line. These people will be refused residence in the area by the Japanese if they do not undergo this injection.</p>
<p>No Inconvenience, City Appearance Unchanged</p>
<p>The situation of the British troops stationed at the iron gate at the end of North Henan Road is the same as yesterday, but the number of British soldiers has been increased by two. The British troops have set up a new post on the side of the Qianjiang Guild Hall on the west side of North Henan Road and Haining Road, with two British soldiers defending it. Because there are no restrictions or inconveniences for the shops and residents in the defense area, they are very calm and the city appearance is unchanged.</p>
<p>Property Rights in the Occupied Areas are Strictly Prohibited from Being Changed, Exploiting Opportunities to Seize and Transfer, Legally Ineffective</p>
<p>The National Government strictly prohibits the illegal change of property rights in the occupied areas. According to the announcement, public and private property rights in the occupied areas must not be illegally transferred or seized. Those who are malicious exploit the extraordinary period and the failure to restore local order to seize the property rights of others or deliberately destroy evidence as a step to seize and transfer property. These are not only legally ineffective, but also a violation of criminal law. All relevant agencies in the occupied areas have been ordered and the people are allowed to report secretly in preparation for a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>The Pacific Sailing Ship Has Disappeared Without a Trace, Hopes for the Safety of Andersen and Others Have Been Largely Abandoned, No News Has Been Received for 71 Days</p>
<p>The *Continental Daily News* reports that news was learned from Shanghai last night (the 23rd) that all hope has been abandoned for the safety of American navigator Andersen and his sailing ship *Pacific*. According to Mr. Mortimer, the chairman of the board of the Sino-American Book Company, the owner of the *Pacific* sailing ship, he had hoped to hear from Andersen again, but that hope has now been abandoned. Andersen sailed from Shanghai with the intention of crossing the Pacific Ocean to San Francisco. He encountered a series of unfortunate events along the way. The last time news was received was on July 13, when there were Andersen, his Russian wife, four crew members, and a dog and cat on board, and they were running out of food and water. Fortunately, they were heard by the *President Coolidge* near Meetwhistle Island, which provided them with drinking water and food. Forty-five minutes later, the *President Coolidge* continued on its way to Shanghai. Before leaving, Andersen said that he could reach San Francisco in at most 50 days. However, 71 days have passed since then, and no news has been received of Andersen and the *Pacific*. Although there is still a faint hope that the ship is still afloat, the ship's water supply was only enough to last for 55 days at most. In that case, Andersen and others have been without water for 16 days. Andersen is one of the Pacific's most famous American captains and has 31 years of maritime experience. Going to San Francisco on the *Pacific* to attend the New York World's Fair may have been his last voyage. The hope that they are still alive has largely disappeared. The Renji Hospital August report stated that there were 22,966 outpatients, 608 inpatients, 61 male suicides, 74 female suicides, 17 factory accidents, 615 patients sent by the Public Concession police, and 52 patients sent by the French Concession police. Looking at the above figures, the work in August increased by 10% compared to the previous month. The number of factory accidents decreased by 50%, which is an exception. The diseases treated were all summer epidemics.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Disaster in Centuries, Severe Floods in North China, Natural and War Disasters Cause Immense Suffering, International Relief is Striving to Help, Mr. Edwards Returns to Shanghai After Traveling Through the Flooded Areas</h3>
<p>The *Continental Daily News* reports that Mr. Edwards, the secretary of the International Committee of the YMCA and acting chairman of the China International Famine Relief Commission, has just returned to Shanghai after traveling through the flood area of North China. He told reporters yesterday (the 23rd) that there is a terrible flood tragedy in North China now, and the main disaster that will follow it will be famine. It is expected that when winter comes, countless people will suffer the indescribable pain of this disaster. Coupled with the disasters of war, this disaster will be the most tragic disaster China has encountered in centuries. In the past, when North China encountered floods, the two major markets of the three northeastern provinces and Inner Mongolia, which were controlled by the Japanese, provided food relief. These two markets are now closed. In the flooded area itself, on the one hand, it is still suffering from a long drought, and on the other hand, large areas of land in Hebei and Shandong provinces have become marshes. There will be no grain to be harvested this year. Once the cold season comes, many people will die of famine and disease. During the North China floods of 1920, the three northeastern provinces and Inner Mongolia transported millet and grains by train every day for three months, which were distributed by the committee, and the great famine was avoided. Now that the two markets have been closed, and the distribution of food must be determined by the local Japanese authorities, it is quite difficult. The committee is currently considering the possibility of purchasing American wheat. To achieve this goal, the committee and its relief committee in Tianjin and Peking need 3 million yuan, but it has only received 300,000 yuan. The New York-based Church Committee for China Relief has already sent US$10,000, but this is only a portion of the funds needed. It is expected that the current water level in the flooded area will not recede until the freezing season. During his trip to North China, he has seen a pitiful sight. In the Tianjin area, many families are still living on the roofs of their houses, and food and drinking water are transported and supplied by boats. From Tianjin to Tanggu, 30 miles to the south, there is nothing but a sea, which can be called the greatest flood disaster in Chinese history. Only the flood disaster can be fought against, but since there is war, there must be a great humanitarian struggle to save the innocent from starving to death, that is, to struggle to obtain and control the food and supplies urgently needed in the area.</p>
<h3>Planning Happiness Sets Sail</h3>
<p>Derping's Loading is Insufficient and Postponed, Norwegian Ship Dabu's Voyage to Ningbo Undecided</p>
<p>Moufuk, of German merchant Reiss &amp; Co.'s shipping department, returned to Shanghai from Zhenhai on the 15th of this month, and anchored at Jin Liyuan Wharf. As it was delayed by a dispute when weighing anchor from Zhenhai, it has now been resolved and will sail as usual. The ship weighed anchor and sailed to Zhenhai at 4:30 PM yesterday, and will arrive at the Zhenhai port this morning. According to the shipping industry, according to international law, ships of belligerent countries are not subject to any hindrance when sailing on the coast of neutral countries. Furthermore, the Derping, of Sino-Italian company, was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 24th, but according to a telegram, it was postponed to the 26th due to insufficient loading. In addition, Dabu, of Norwegian merchant Wah Lun &amp; Co., which was originally scheduled to join the Shanghai-Ningbo route today, is now still under consideration because the number of ships on the route has increased and the cargo transport is relatively light.</p>
<h3>Mail Ship Arrivals</h3>
<p>Coolidge and Chepad Arrive Today, Ellora Departs Shanghai for Bombay</p>
<p>The United States President Lines' Pacific regular mail ship</p>
<p>*Coolidge*</p>
<p>arrived in Shanghai from the United States on the 13th of this month, bound for Hong Kong and Manila. It has now returned from Manila. It passed Hong Kong yesterday and is scheduled to enter port at 12:30 PM today (the 25th). It is scheduled to anchor at buoys 11 and 12. The passenger launch will depart from the new customs wharf at 12:30 PM this afternoon. Passengers will return to the new customs wharf to disembark at 2:10 PM this afternoon. The ship is scheduled to weigh anchor and depart tomorrow morning (the 26th) at 6:00 AM, returning to Los Angeles via Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and other places according to the original itinerary. The second route mail ship of the Java-China-Japan Lijn shipping company,</p>
<p>*Chepad*,</p>
<p>departed from Surabaya, passed through Hong Kong and Xiamen, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning. It is scheduled to weigh anchor and depart from Shanghai on the 28th, returning to Surabaya via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and various places in Southeast Asia along the original route. The regular Eurasia line mail ship of the French Postal Company,</p>
<p>*Athos*,</p>
<p>is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Europe tomorrow morning (the 26th), anchoring at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. This ship will not go to Japan this time. It will stay in Shanghai for two days and is scheduled to return to Europe on the 28th. The Great Britain Company's *Ellora* (i.e., *Mylapore*) is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Japan around the 26th and is scheduled to depart for Bombay on the 27th. The report in the newspaper the day before yesterday that the ship was departing from Shanghai for London was a misreport. Moreover, the company's voyages of all ships traveling to the Far East have been completely suspended since the outbreak of the European war. It is currently undecided whether they will resume next month.</p>
<h3>A Strange Case of Sinking a Giant Ship at Gaochang Temple's Jiangnan Shipyard: The Sunken Ship Was a Chinese Vessel Salvaged and Then Deliberately Sunk After Repairs and Trial Run</h3>
<p>A strange case of a giant ship being deliberately sunk occurred at the Jiangnan Shipyard near Gaochang Temple in the Nanshi district on the night of the 21st. The Japanese side is taking this matter extremely seriously, suspecting it to be the work of patriotic Chinese. A large number of workers are expected to be detained and interrogated. It is reported that the Jiangnan Shipyard was seized after the war and renamed "Mitsubishi Shipyard." Several foremen with a money-grubbing mentality were used to recruit ignorant Chinese laborers, reaching three to four thousand in number, specifically to repair damaged Japanese warships or merchant vessels.</p>
<p>Repairs Completed After Four Months</p>
<p>In May of this year, a giant ship, which had been sunk by the Chinese side during the war, was salvaged from somewhere and towed into the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs. After four months, the repairs were completely finished. On the 21st, the ship was moved from the dock into the water and moored in the center of the river, waiting to be fired up for a trial run. However, at midnight that day, several leaks suddenly appeared in the bottom of the ship, which could not be stopped. Upon discovering this, the watchman quickly fled in a small boat, narrowly escaping being submerged with the ship.</p>
<p>Entirely Submerged Within an Hour</p>
<p>The ship was entirely submerged within one hour, and the watchman, fearing the consequences, also fled completely. The following morning, the Japanese military authorities were informed of the incident. After investigating, it appeared to be a type of ship-sinking technique premeditated by patriotic Chinese. They were immediately enraged and began to search and arrest workers at the Jiangnan Shipyard. All those who had participated in the repair of the ship, numbering over a hundred, were detained. There were no leads, and it is reported that some have been released, while others are still under strict interrogation.</p>
<h3>Refugee Relief Cooperative Agrees to Establish Three Factories</h3>
<p>Sock Factory to Open Next Month; Fundraising Campaign Launched</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Cooperative, recognizing the large concentration of refugees in the city, has decided to establish factories and other production ventures to provide sustainable support for the refugees. Yesterday at noon, they convened a meeting of all directors and supervisors to discuss raising funds. Leaders from various industries, including Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Wu Zhaoyuan, Pan Zhaobang, Yang Caoxian, and several dozen others, were invited. The cooperative's executive director, Chen Peide, and general manager, Yin Rangneng, successively reported on the cooperative's affairs. After deliberation, a fundraising method was decided upon, with the goal of raising enough capital to begin production work for the refugees. Three factories will be established to produce socks, towels, handkerchiefs, and miscellaneous goods. A section of the sock factory has already been established, and the opening ceremony is scheduled for the first of next month. A fundraising campaign to promote the products will be launched, with various industry leaders soliciting donations. This kind of sustainable relief effort will undoubtedly be supported by enthusiastic members of society. Among them, Yang Caoxian generously donated all his capital of over four thousand yuan to the production fund.</p>
<h3>Many Businesses Settle Accounts at the Mid-Autumn Festival, Generating Significant Profits</h3>
<p>Stockpiling Various Goods Proves Profitable; Smooth Passage Through the Festival Guaranteed</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival. As per usual custom, businesses in all industries will settle their accounts. Members of the silver and currency exchange guilds will all take a day off. Currently, various companies and firms are sending personnel to collect outstanding debts from both local and out-of-town customers as the Mid-Autumn settlement period approaches. Due to the fact that most transactions after the war are conducted in cash, special attention is paid to extending credit. Therefore, there are absolutely no bad debts this Mid-Autumn Festival. Businesses have generated significant profits by stockpiling goods after the outbreak of the European war, so a smooth passage through this Mid-Autumn Festival is guaranteed. As for the overall financial market, it has remained stable thanks to the lending and discounting activities of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China, as well as the regulatory efforts of the Silver and Currency Exchange Preparation Committee and the effectiveness of the new remittance system. However, trading on the black market is subject to fluctuations due to manipulation by speculators, but this is unrelated to the overall financial situation.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador de Ryckman de Betz Has Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Journal of the 24th, Belgian Ambassador to China de Ryckman de Betz recently returned to Shanghai on the Japanese ship "Koteng Maru" and has resumed his duties.</p>
<h3>Encouraging Overseas Chinese Investment and Development by Providing Various Conveniences; Incentive Measures Have Been Revised by the Ministry; Acquired Rights Remain Valid After the War</h3>
<p>The Chinese government is fully committed to developing its resources and encouraging overseas Chinese to invest in domestic economic enterprises. Since the promulgation of the incentive measures, overseas Chinese, such as Hu Wenhu, have organized inspection groups to return to China for investigations and have raised large sums of money to invest domestically, such as establishing factories and cooperating with the authorities to develop mines, as well as various other construction projects. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has revised the incentive measures, stipulating that for any economic enterprise, including those related to agriculture, mining, industry, commerce, and national defense, where overseas Chinese capital accounts for more than 60% of the total capital, the following incentives and assistance may be provided: (1) operational and technical guidance and assistance; (2) reduction or exemption of taxes; (3) facilitation of transportation and reduction of freight rates; (4) use of public land; (5) interest guarantees on capital and bonds; (6) provision of subsidies; (7) security guarantees; and (8) awarding of honorary memorabilia. In addition, state-owned economic enterprises may be invested in or jointly operated with special permission from the Ministry. In the event of special difficulties, relief may be requested. After the end of the war, the rights already acquired by overseas Chinese under the incentive measures shall remain valid. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has joined forces with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to encourage overseas Chinese to actively invest. However, when overseas Chinese apply for incentives, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission must certify that they are indeed overseas Chinese. For companies established by overseas Chinese with their headquarters in their place of residence, when establishing the first branch in China, the certification stipulated in Article 43 of the Company Registration Rules may be provided by the Chinese consulate or the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the location of the headquarters.</p>
<h3>French Police Department Strictly Prevents Theft</h3>
<p>Recently, the French Police Department has noted that as autumn arrives and the weather gradually turns colder, coupled with the rising cost of living in Shanghai, unscrupulous individuals are taking advantage of the situation, leading to several cases of robbery and snatching occurring daily in succession. In order to maintain the peace and security of businesses and residents within the Concession and to eliminate traces of theft, the Police Department has dispatched teams of Chinese, Western, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives, armed and patrolling various parts of the Concession day and night. They are also searching passersby. Furthermore, with the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, businesses are routinely sending personnel to collect debts, often carrying cash. The Police Department has issued a special order to all detectives to pay close attention, investigate and arrest bandits and petty thieves, in order to maintain order and protect safety.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Tycoon Qu Hongsheng Passes Away Due to Illness</h3>
<p>The well-known Shanghai real estate tycoon, Qu Hongsheng, who was highly respected for his service to the community, unfortunately fell ill last month. Despite receiving meticulous treatment from famous doctors, he did not improve and passed away yesterday afternoon. The encoffining is scheduled for today at the Paradise Funeral Home.</p>
<h3>Two Gangs of Thieves Arrested for Soliciting Prostitutes, Celebrating and Dividing Loot; Nine Criminals to Be Prosecuted, Three Prostitutes Released</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 22nd of this month, at around 12 o'clock, the French Concession Police Department received a tip-off that the Xinruixing Inn in Bulinli, Gongguan Road, was a center for robbery and pickpocketing gangs. Detectives Mao Jinsheng, Ke Enqing, and Ke Enqi, among others, were dispatched to the address. At the time, the thieves were gathered around candles, celebrating and dividing their loot. Lu A'gen, Ding Yuan'san, Dong Mingguang, Xu A'bao, and four others were apprehended on the spot, and a large amount of stolen goods was confiscated. They confessed that they usually committed theft and robbery in the Ningxing Street vegetable market and in front of the Great World entertainment complex. They also revealed that their main headquarters was located at the Faxing Inn, No. 26 Diandang Street. Based on this information, the head of the detectives dispatched the original detectives to the address. Unexpectedly, a large number of thieves were also gathered in the room, soliciting prostitutes and celebrating. The detectives entered and apprehended them all, including Feng Yao, Chen Xianggen, Wang Jinrong, Ge Hongshun, Yan Jinsheng, and five others, as well as three prostitutes. A large number of stolen goods, witnesses and evidence were also confiscated and taken to the police station. After investigation, the three prostitutes were found to have no criminal suspicion and were immediately released. Yesterday, the criminals were sent to the Second Special Criminal Court for prosecution, where Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated them separately. He ordered a postponement for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Local Security Chief Zhu Guisheng Sued for Fraud; Both Parties Reach a Settlement</h3>
<p>Yu Qingyuan, a native of this city residing at No. 18 Yu Jia Lane, Huage'nie Road, French Concession, had previously needed funds and thus started a mutual aid association with a total of 48 members, each paying a membership fee of 60 yuan per term. After a considerable period, due to Yu Qingyuan's death, the association was dissolved. At that time, Zhu Guisheng (also known as Nuo Ruiqing), who had served as a local security chief, was also a member.</p>
<p>A Total of 1,740 Yuan in Association Fees and a Loan of 300 Yuan to Yu Qingyuan, totaling 2,040 Yuan: Yu's son, Yu Fangben, used a certificate of land ownership for a plot of land measuring 3 fen 4 li 1 hao, Block 9, Yunziwei, No. 11 Special District, Huage'nie Road, to pledge to Zhu as security for repayment. However, another member, Yao Zhijiang, also had unpaid association fees of 670 yuan and filed a lawsuit against Yu Fangben.</p>
<p>Settlement Reached: However, Yu did not fulfill the settlement terms, leading Yao to request the Second Special Court to execute the land certificate pledged to Zhu. The Second Special Court issued an order instructing Zhu to submit the certificate to the court. In addition to complying with the order, Zhu also petitioned to participate in the distribution of the proceeds. Yu then expressed his objection. Zhu formally filed a lawsuit against Yu for debt repayment. During the proceedings, Yu Fangben suddenly filed a lawsuit against Zhu Guisheng in the criminal division of the First Special Court, accusing him of</p>
<p>Fraud and Breach of Trust: Yu claimed that the land certificate was given to Zhu to obtain a business license from the Land Bureau, but Zhu obtained it through malicious and fraudulent means, thus committing the crime of fraud and breach of trust and requesting that he be punished according to the law. Zhu also hired lawyer Zhao Chuanding to defend him, explaining the facts of the case and arguing that Yu's lawsuit had ulterior motives and requesting that he be declared innocent. The case was then mediated by relatives and friends of both parties, who argued that since the two parties</p>
<p>Were Relatives (Yu Qingyuan was the wife's brother of Zhu Guisheng's brother, Zhu Guifu), it was inappropriate for them to litigate against each other. As a result, Yu admitted to repaying the association fees owed to Zhu Guisheng in installments. Therefore, yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the First Special Court heard the case of Yu Fangben suing Zhu Guisheng for fraud and breach of trust. The plaintiff, Yu Fangben, immediately requested to withdraw the lawsuit. After questioning by Judge Jiang, the withdrawal of the lawsuit was approved.</p>
<h3>More Than a Dozen Thugs Robbed Goods Late at Night; Three Arrested and Sent to Court</h3>
<p>Chen Laohu, a local resident who works as a lighterman, had his lighter fully loaded with peanuts on the afternoon of the 13th of this month. Due to the late hour, the lighter was docked at Pier 4 of the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund. Unexpectedly, more than a dozen thugs, including Zhou Dingsheng (from Gaoyou, nicknamed "Pockmarked Face"), Lin Minxin (from Huzhou, nicknamed "Trumpet"), Li Changsheng (also known as "Little Shandong"), Little Rotten Foot, Little Yang, Wu Jintang, and others, swarmed onto the boat, forcibly trying to seize the peanuts. Upon seeing this, Chen resisted and shouted for help. The thugs used iron bars to beat Chen severely, and stole two large bundles of peanuts. Afterwards, Chen reported the incident to the Water Police, who dispatched detective Qu Deming and arrested Zhou Dingsheng, Lin Minxin, and Li Changsheng on separate occasions in the past few days. Yesterday, they were transferred to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. After questioning each of them, Judge Qiu ordered a postponement for further questioning. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Overview for August: Cholera Season Has Passed, Malaria Significantly Increased</h3>
<p>Last month, the health situation in the city was similar to normal, without any major events worthy of attention. Dysentery and diarrhea increased seasonally, but did not reach the same levels as in the same month last year. Twenty-eight cases of confirmed cholera were reported. Considering the population of the city, the number of cases was extremely small and not indicative of a spreading trend. Moreover, cholera epidemics generally occur before the end of August. The cholera season has passed, and even if it does spread, it will be mild. However, the situation in the city is special, and the future is unpredictable. The Municipal Council's slaughterhouse has seen a significant reduction in operations since the outbreak of the Shanghai War in the previous year, but has recently returned to its pre-war state. Malaria has increased significantly, but because some of the areas where this disease occurs are not under the jurisdiction of the Health Department, it is impossible to control it.</p>
<p>The number of recorded Chinese deaths was 2,767, of which 1,619 were exposed corpses. The main causes of death were typhoid fever, tuberculosis, dysentery, and diarrhea. Sixty-eight people requested treatment for rabies from the Health Department. 162,697 cubic centimeters of cholera vaccine and 13,925 doses of smallpox vaccine were distributed. 139 cubic centimeters of typhoid and paratyphoid vaccine were distributed. The Municipal Council's isolation hospitals were relatively quiet, but the police hospital remained busy, admitting 225 Chinese patients and 28 Indian patients. The School Medical Section held a summer trachoma prevention campaign, with clinics open all day to treat students with trachoma from various Chinese elementary schools. A total of 335 students voluntarily sought treatment, a decrease of 110 from July. Members were dispatched to inspect 170 Chinese private schools receiving subsidies from the Municipal Council. As a result, 23 schools were found to have unsatisfactory internal health conditions, and were notified or warned accordingly.</p>
<p>The vegetable markets operated as usual. A total of 3,859 pigs were imported from other ports and landed on the Bund, an increase of over 1,400 from the previous month. 8,154 residents were vaccinated against smallpox by the Health Department, and 137,453 were vaccinated against other diseases. Since the start of the disease prevention campaign in April of this year, a total of 585,680 residents have been vaccinated. The work to eliminate mosquitoes and flies has been quite effective. The refugee shelters within the Concession housed a total of 39,342 refugees, about the same as the previous month. The health situation was satisfactory. A total of 2,299 bodies were cremated and 763 coffins were buried.</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Suspects in the Chen Weida Burglary Case Still Required</h3>
<p>At 7:30 AM on the 6th of this month, the home of Chen Weida, a local resident at No. 13, Lane 170, Route Lafayette, French Concession, was suddenly invaded by four armed bandits, who robbed them of over a thousand yuan in cash and jewelry. The bandits fled after obtaining the loot. Chen filed a loss report with the French police station, requesting the arrest of the thieves. At 5:00 PM on the 12th, Shao Zuoting (28 years old), a native of Ningbo working as a rice shop employee at No. 11 Broadway Building, Broadway Road, was waiting for his wife near the trolley station at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue du Marché in the French Concession. He was spotted by Wang A'bao, a maid in the Chen Weida household, who identified Shao as one of the robbers. He was taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court, requesting detention for investigation and postponement for further questioning. Details have been noted in this newspaper. It is now known that Shao, during the investigation at the police station, produced five colleagues to testify that he was working at the Broadway Building and had not gone out at the time of the Chen family robbery. The case was heard by Judge Miao Qingbang on the morning of the day before yesterday. Lawyer Chen, representing the French Concession administration, presented the facts of the case and filed a lawsuit according to the law. The defendant, Shao Zuoting, hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin to defend him, arguing that he was mistakenly identified as a robber by the victim. Chen Bangqian, the daughter of Chen Weida, appeared in court. Given the complexity of the testimony of the witnesses, which required detailed verification, it was ordered that the hearing be postponed to the 27th. The defendant was temporarily returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Forcing Women into Prostitution</h3>
<p>The Ge A'rong Couple Sentenced</p>
<p>Ge A'rong and his wife, Ge Bai'shi, natives of Suzhou who operated brothels at No. 9, Lane 65, Shantou Road, and No. 36, Lane 9, Yunnan Road, were arrested by the Lao Zha Men Police Station for forcing Wang Lingmei, a woman from a respectable family, into prostitution and for abusing Wang's one-year-old son, Wang Genlin. They were sent to the First Special Court for trial. Judge Feng Shide sentenced Ge A'rong to one year of imprisonment for inducing a woman from a respectable family into prostitution as a business, and six months of imprisonment for causing bodily harm. The sentences were to be served concurrently for a total of one year and four months. Ge Bai'shi was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.</p>

<p>American Relief Organization Entrusts Investigation; Reply with Credibility</p>
<p>The relief efforts in this city after August 13th were extremely great, receiving widespread support from international friendly nations. The Shanghai International Committee of the Chinese Red Cross previously received a request from an American relief organization to investigate the relief expenses of various relief organizations in Shanghai from the outbreak of the August 13th Incident to June of this year. The committee sent letters to various relief organizations seeking information. As a small number of relief organizations have not yet responded, the committee sent a reminder yesterday to ensure credibility, and hopes that there will be no further delay.</p>
<h3>Counterfeiters Punished</h3>
<p>Zhang Qingwei, a native of Ningbo residing at No. 151 Rue du Marché, French Concession, was arrested by detectives from the Xin Zha Men Police Station at the intersection of Rue Chihli and Route Yu Yuen on the morning of the 15th of this month while carrying seventy counterfeit five-yuan notes from the Central Bank of China. He was sent to the First Special Court for trial and detained. The case was heard by Judge Chuan. The defendant confessed that he was entrusted by a friend to deliver the notes to Hongkou.

<h3>Please Transfer Festival Feast Expenses to Donate to Refugees for Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Among all festivals, the Chinese people are most interested in entertainment as well as in food. For example, there are many shops or families that are very frugal with their meals on ordinary days. However, when it comes to the "New Year" or "festivals", they must have rich fish and meat to feast on! The meaning behind this is that shops reward their employees and students for their hard work during the festival, while families gather together to celebrate the holiday or invite relatives and friends to dine together to connect and express their feelings. This is quite normal. Now that the Lunar Mid-Autumn Festival (the 27th) has arrived, it is expected that some shops and families will once again have a lively feast with various dishes and drinks.</p>
<p>In terms of timing, since it is Mid-Autumn Festival, if it were a peaceful time, people could enjoy drinking and having fun to celebrate this annual holiday. But what time is it now? The national crisis is severe, the environment is harsh, prices are soaring, and it is difficult to make a living. What is the situation in various parts of the country? Recently, the Tianjin floods have affected countless disaster victims! Even in this isolated island of Shanghai, which is said to have a population of five million, the poor account for a large proportion. The incident of people being injured or killed while scrambling for cheap rice shows how many people are living in misery! As for the refugees in this city, their numbers have not decreased. Although Mr. Yu Qiaqing has allocated 10,000 bags of tribute rice to help them, the problem of food is temporarily solved. However, as Mid-Autumn Festival passes and the weather turns colder, the lack of winter clothing for the refugees is a serious problem! Recently, it was reported that Mr. Roosevelt, Chairman of the United China Relief of the United States, issued a second "Bowl of Rice Movement" declaration. He is an American, yet he is so sympathetic. We are compatriots, so how can we bear to sit idly by and not help? Therefore, two days before the festival, I urge those who are preparing to drink and celebrate to forgo your festival banquets and transfer the money for the banquets to help the refugees, so that they may buy winter clothing. It will not affect you much if you eat one less festive meal, but it will be a great act of merit if the refugees receive your gift.</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Socks</h3>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, we still wore cloth socks made by hand. Cloth socks have no elasticity, so they cannot conform to the curves of the feet. When worn, they would bulge in some places and wrinkle in others, making them very uncomfortable! Since foreigners invented yarn socks with fine holes, they have been elastic and comfortable, fitting well and being hygienic. They are extremely convenient! Cloth socks have gradually been eliminated. Today, even in remote rural areas, people wear yarn socks. Those who wear cloth socks are now as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns!</p>
<p>The evolution of socks can now be said to have reached its peak. In terms of materials, there are socks woven from cotton yarn, silk, wool, and rayon, which can be used for different climates. In terms of size, there are socks as small as three or four inches for infants, and as large as more than a foot for the largest feet. In terms of color, there are shades from light to dark, in all kinds of colors. They can also be woven with various patterns and come in long and short lengths. Men, women, old, and young all have their own styles. Civilization has truly progressed, and the feet are fortunate!</p>
<p>The tools for knitting socks have also been improved from hand-cranked machines to electric machines. Each hand-cranked machine can produce up to two dozen pairs of socks per day, while an electric machine can produce up to fifty dozen pairs. Therefore, most of the larger sock factories in Shanghai now use electric knitting machines, while hand-cranked machines have become widespread in the interior of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, becoming a household sideline for women. (One can rent a hand-cranked machine from a sock factory and set it up at home.) Although socks made with hand-cranked machines are still beautiful, they are inevitably uneven in elasticity and thickness due to manual labor! Socks made with electric machines will never have these defects.</p>
<p>Whether silk or wool socks, Chinese sock factories can now weave them themselves. Therefore, in recent years, the import of genuine foreign socks has been decreasing, which is gratifying! However, in terms of raw materials, except for silk and some cotton yarn, which can be supplied domestically, other materials such as wool and rayon still need to be imported, which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Recently, there is a new type of sock that has elastic bands woven into the top, so that the legs no longer need to use garters. This is another new evolution of socks.</p>
<h3>Untitled</h3>
<p>With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, mooncakes are a seasonal product. This year's mooncakes are extremely expensive, with a single Cantonese-style lotus seed paste mooncake with egg yolk costing 65 cents. However, despite the high price, some people in Shanghai hold the attitude that "seasonal products must be eaten".</p>
<p>After the autumn winds rise, the weather is getting colder day by day. In recent days, the display windows of major companies have been changed to feature new autumn clothes instead of the light summer clothes. Rich people are saying, "We need to buy new clothes again." Poor people are saying, "In addition to food, we now have the problem of clothing."</p>
<p>Liangxiang chestnuts have appeared on the market. Seeing Liangxiang chestnuts cannot help but remind me of "Where is home when the country is broken?" But remembering is useless. It is better to start today, strive to improve ourselves, and become a promising young person.</p>
<p>The poor people's "food" used to be rice, but now it can only be porridge. Recently, it can only be noodles. On the other hand, some rich people have made money off of the national crisis, and now some are making money off of the European war. They can go from eating rice to eating fancy dishes. Alas! This world is truly unfair. (Yong)</p>
<h3>A Week's Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Last week's menu mentioned cooking methods for crabs, suggesting three types: crab in batter, braised crab with greens, and stir-fried crab meat with shredded pork. However, I forgot to mention braised tofu with crab meat. Actually, this is the most economical dish of all. Although prices are soaring, tofu is still relatively cheap. Currently, in Shanghai society, anything that is about seeking cheap and happy things is called "eating tofu". So, why not really eat more tofu, which is both economical and rich in vitamins? When you add tofu to the crab meat, you can use less crab meat. The cooking method is also very simple, and most ordinary families can make it well. The layer of crab oil on top of the soup is so golden and appealing. It tastes delicious when eaten hot, but it's not as good when it's cold, and it has a fishy smell.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Green vegetable and shredded pork soup, braised tofu with crab meat, plain stir-fried golden needle vegetable, braised sprouted beans</p>
<p>Tuesday Celery with shredded beef, braised sliced carp, pickled mustard greens with soybean sprouts, fried dough sticks with chicken vegetable</p>
<p>Wednesday Ten-ingredient stir-fried meat with sauce, steamed crucian carp, stir-fried gluten with shrimp roe, sweet bean sauce fried eggplant</p>
<p>Thursday Curry beef slices, braised crab with greens, pickled mustard greens with broad bean puree, Peking cabbage with bean curd sheets</p>
<p>Friday Dried vegetable braised pork, sweet and sour small yellow croaker, braised vegetarian ten-ingredient dish, stewed stinky tofu</p>
<p>Saturday Tomato beef soup, salted dried fish stewed with pork patty, vermicelli stir-fried greens, sweet bean sauce fried flat beans</p>
<p>Sunday Meat stewed with eggs, crab in batter, stir-fried water spinach, mung bean sprouts</p>
<h3>Soybean Powder as a Milk Substitute</h3>
<p>— Fan Xiqian</p>
<p>A foreign doctor once treated an infant suffering from anemia caused by drinking goat's milk. He fed the baby 25 to 42 grams of soybean powder daily, and the baby's complexion gradually improved. The anemia was cured in just two weeks. The components of soybeans are rich in blood-building elements, which has been proven to contain large amounts of copper, iron, protein, and vitamin B.</p>
<p>It is common knowledge that iron can produce blood. Recently, some doctors have advocated taking iron and copper together to treat anemia, with greater effectiveness. However, many people experience gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea, vomiting, and loss of appetite after taking them, and have to stop taking them midway. If soybean powder is used, there is no such problem.</p>
<p>Soybean powder is a common food in our country, but no one knows that it contains protein and vitamin B, which can cure anemia. The method of making soybean powder is very simple. First, stir-fry the soybeans until they are hot, and then grind them into a fine powder. You can also buy soybean powder on the market to reduce trouble.</p>
<p>When weaning, you can put soybean powder in milk, adding three grams of soybean powder to every 100 grams of milk. Mix well into a thin paste and feed it to children. It is very nutritious. The most economical way is to mix it into tofu soup, which has the same effect. Otherwise, it can be mixed into porridge. For older children, soybean powder and sugar can be used to make various cakes and dumplings.</p>
<p>Using soybean powder as a substitute for milk powder is also very beneficial. First, boil 30 grams of sesame oil in a pot. Then add 30 grams of flour and mix vigorously. Then add 70 grams of soybean powder, 50 grams of white sugar, and 2 grams of salt. Boil until it becomes a paste. The above ingredients are enough for a small child to eat for a day. However, children's physical condition and age vary, so the ratio can be adjusted accordingly. After children use soybean powder as a milk substitute, they should eat 30 grams of fresh fruit juice every day, just like drinking milk powder, so that the nutrition is sufficient.</p>
<p>Now the price of milk powder substitutes is expensive, and the monthly cost is often higher than the cost of hiring a wet nurse, which is a burden for parents. If soybean powder is used as a milk substitute, it is very economical.</p>
<h3>The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of Steel King Schwab</h3>
<p>— Weixiao</p>
<p>Mr. Schwab, the American tycoon known as the "Steel King," passed away in New York on the 19th of this month. When Schwab is mentioned, people are immediately reminded of how much the "Steel King's" assets really are. It is estimated to be around 1.2 billion US dollars. However, despite having such a large fortune, Mr. Schwab was a well-known thrifty person. He often said to people: "Money is mankind's great desire, but more money does not necessarily bring happiness. The greatest happiness in life lies in doing good. If someone is diligent and thrifty but not like this, then their happiness will gradually disappear. Therefore, I have experienced happiness in my life that cannot be obtained by money." Here, we can get a glimpse of his personality. Now, let's talk about Mr. Schwab's clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and see what they are like.</p>
<p>Clothing</p>
<p>Mr. Schwab has a special characteristic when it comes to clothing, which is that he likes to choose clothes in stores by himself. Because of this, a joke happened about five years ago. One day, Mr. Schwab was wearing very plain, ordinary clothes when he suddenly went to a store to choose clothes. He selected an evening dress worth more than 500 US dollars. It happened that he encountered a young shop assistant who was arrogant and contemptuous. The shop assistant asked Mr. Schwab to pay half of the price as a deposit first, but Mr. Schwab only had a few dozen US dollars with him. How could that be enough? Finally, he asked the shop assistant to deliver the clothes to his home, but the shop assistant didn't believe that this old man was from the "Steel King's" family. How could he know that he was the "Steel King"? As a result, he was rejected. Mr. Schwab was extremely angry and called the store manager when he got home. After explaining the situation, the manager apologized to Mr. Schwab and immediately fired the shop assistant. However, Mr. Schwab couldn't bear it and gave him a position as a staff member in the Mecitolecton steel refinery. With special caution and effort over the years, he is now the import manager of the factory. His name is Weinesoson.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Regarding food, Mr. Schwab did not like mixed foods. Besides the normal Western dishes, he was most fond of fruits, and his life-sustaining tonic was the Dragon Ros瓜 (produced in Gaden, northern United States). This melon is rich in vitamin B, and the car magnate Ford and Secretary of State Hull both loved to eat it. Every week, a light yellow car could be seen speeding on the Newdens Highway. This was a special car from the Ford Motor Factory, going to select and pick Dragon Ros melons to bring back for Mr. Schwab and Ford to eat. However, Mr. Schwab did not like rabbit meat and would never eat it.</p>
<p>Housing</p>
<p>At the eastern end of Oceanus on Broadway in New York, there is a towering 27-story building, which is his private residence. When we see the exterior of this building, which is entirely made of marble and mica, we can estimate how luxurious and valuable the house is. Unfortunately, the gate is heavily guarded on weekdays, so we cannot know exactly what it is like inside.</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>Mr. Schwab was unexpectedly enthusiastic about charitable causes, and the expenses he spent each year were more than three million US dollars. He was most concerned about a large-scale orphanage in Gas Shelipov, northern United States. He liked these innocent children the most. Every summer, he had to go to Jominisun Mountain to escape the summer heat. When passing through here, Mr. Schwab had to stay for at least a week before returning to New York. He liked to play with those children at will. As for when he was in New York, Mr. Schwab often went to Ford's private residence to play racquetball, or the two of them would race dogs in the suburbs. Every month, he had to go to Washington, D.C., because there were many things to discuss with President Roosevelt or Hull. When he was in Washington, he liked to linger in major theaters to watch plays.</p>

<h3>The Post-War Pawn Industry</h3>
<p>No damage within the industry, on the contrary, profits were gained. Increasing interest rates beyond reason is against the welfare of the public.</p>
<p>"Pawn," this huge, black character can always be found on the chalk-white walls or the terrazzo Shikumen walls on any street. It's an eye-catching, numbered character: "Pawn" -- it is the source of wealth for the poor and the lifeline of the impoverished class. Isn't that right? In front of that wide doorway, a poor man with a sallow face, carrying a small bundle under his arm, darts into the doorway like a mouse when you least expect it. In a moment, he comes out again with the empty bundle, rushing out in two or three strides, a faint smile barely appearing on his worried face -- such a tense scene plays out several times a day, I don't know how many times!</p>
<p>The "August 13th" artillery fire destroyed the homes of thousands of people. Having lost their reliance in their hometowns, where was their final destination? Therefore, they could only flee to the "isolated island" of Shanghai. The resident capacity of the "isolated island" reached its saturation point! But as time went on, the "refugee capital" that had been accumulated from home was almost used up. The only way to remedy this was to go to the pawnshop, pawn the few things they had, and exchange them for one yuan and a half to maintain a few days of impoverished life. Therefore, the opening of pawnshops in the concessions was like bamboo shoots after a rain, pawnshops were adorned on the streets every five steps and pawnshops every three steps.</p>
<p>Recently, the price of rice has risen to forty yuan per picul, coal briquettes are more than four yuan per load, and everything has risen, risen, and risen several times! Therefore, the pawn industry, under the pretext of "sharp contraction of foreign exchange" and "high cost of everything", announced that it would increase interest rates starting this month.</p>
<p>Their method is: starting from the first of the month, the pawn interest rate will be uniformly increased to two cents. However, in fact, this method is not unified. In the past, the pawn interest rate was 1.6%, some was 1.8%, and some pawnshops even had 3-4%, which has made the poor feel extremely panic. Currently? In this "isolated island" of deep water and scorching heat, the owners of pawnshops are raising the pawn interest rate wantonly. The livelihood of the poor will become even more difficult as a result, which is unnecessary to repeat.</p>
<p>Here, let us turn around and look at the pawn industry. Is it necessary for them to increase the pawn interest rate?</p>
<p>After the war, the pawnshops in the war zone, of course, suffered considerable losses due to the war, which is not within the scope of this article. As for the pawnshops in the concessions? Not only did they not suffer any losses, but on the contrary, they gained many profits. Just take the ornaments in the unredeemed goods as an example. The price of gold before the war was about 100 yuan, but now it has soared several times. Their profit on this alone is considerable. Other unredeemed goods such as clothing, copper, and tin utensils also have quite a lot of profit. Under these circumstances, it is really unreasonable for the pawn industry to increase interest rates. This will not only make the poor feel difficult to make a living, but also affect the peace of society.</p>
<p>For the benefit of the public and the peace of society, I think that increasing the pawn interest rate seems to be unreasonable.</p>

<h3>Three "No's" for Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>(1) Stop giving festival gifts: In this year, everything is expensive and life is difficult. It costs at least a dozen yuan to give a minimum festival gift, and it costs even more if you are generous. One person does this, and everyone does this, thinking that "human relations are heavier than debt", and that gifts must be given in return. However, in this special environment of difficult living, the act of giving festival gifts can indeed save money. If you have the power to give festival gifts and it is unavoidable, it is better to use this gift money as a donation to relieve refugees. This is more practical, benefiting both yourself and the recipient of the gift, and refugees can be relieved. The gift-giver and the recipient of the gift will definitely agree and will never lose their original feelings because of this.</p>
<p>(2) Do not burn incense burners: Qi Yue Gong, burning incense burners, is fundamentally a boring and superstitious thing. Burning an incense burner costs at least a few cents for a small one and even several yuan for a large one. The rich, of course, do not think this small amount is strange. However, when this small amount is calculated in total, the annual consumption of burning incense burners alone is as high as tens of thousands of yuan. If the consumption of burning incense burners can be changed to buying warm clothes and donating them to refugees, because the weather is already in autumn, and it is getting colder day by day, the refugees' warm clothes and food are equally urgent and necessary.</p>
<p>Abolish festival banquets: During the three festivals (Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and New Year's Eve), the shopkeeper must invite the shop assistants to eat a table of sumptuous banquets. In the past, both the shopkeeper and the shop assistants felt that this was a waste. Many of the funds for wine and food were used as donations. It is hoped that this can continue to be implemented during this Mid-Autumn Festival. If you eat one less meal of wine and vegetables, the refugees will benefit from it.</p>
<p>In short, regarding the extravagance of this festival, whether it is the gift-giver or the recipient of the gift, whether it is the trade or the residents, if they can self-motivate and self-consciously, on the one hand, they can try their best to save festival expenses, and on the other hand, they are willing to donate and relieve as much as possible. This is also the obligation that the people of the "isolated island" should fulfill for the people and the country.</p>
<h3>Speculation is "Big Fish Eat Small Fish". The Manipulation of Large Capitalists Results in More Losses than Gains. It Is Better to Make a Proper Investment Than to Engage in Speculation.</h3>
<p>It is a bad phenomenon during the war: the general public is transferring property from Chinese banks to foreign banks; the general public is taking back capital invested in businesses and putting it at home; the general public is waiting for opportunities to make a business that can easily earn big money. In this phenomenon, there are two factions: one is a miser, and the other is a speculator. To sum up, they are equally afraid that the war will swallow their property, so they take back capital from legitimate businesses. As a result, indigenous industries are gradually declining, and the power of foreign goods is gradually rising. In addition, the manipulation of speculators has made the market fall into extreme chaos, and people's lives fall into extreme panic.</p>
<p>However, speculation does not necessarily lead to wealth, as has been proven by facts. First, speculative business is always "big fish eat small fish." All markets are manipulated by a few large capitalists. The rise and fall of market prices are determined by how much they eat in and spit out, and it is up to them to create opportunities for getting rich by raising waves and spreading rumors for no reason. Second, the fact that imported goods have not been completely cut off makes it impossible for general hoarders to guarantee profits. The soaring price of paper has now fallen. The turbulent price of rice is also falling gradually. Although the price of coal is still rising, it will also fall one day, because the source of white coal has not been cut off. Any abnormally developed business will inevitably have such a consequence. In this process, although a few people make a profit, the number of people who suffer more losses than gains must account for the majority.</p>
<p>If we go and ask the people who run legitimate businesses? Even if it is someone who opens a small shop, he will surely tell you happily: "I made some money this year!" This means that investing in legitimate businesses is much more stable than engaging in speculative business. This is not just empty talk, but a real situation.</p>
<p>Recently, quite a few people have been studying shortcuts to getting rich. This circle has expanded from speculation to wives and grandmothers. They have a headache with business, and they are asking everywhere: "What is the easiest thing to get rich doing?" So they try to buy foreign exchange, hoard rice, and go to silver shops to make gold jewelry. But they have no power, no skill, and are completely at the mercy of others. As a result, when it rises, they hope to earn more; when it falls, they panic that they will suffer a big loss, and hurriedly spit out as much as possible. When you add it all up, it still comes out to be a loss.</p>
<p>Chinese folk has infinite wealth, and China's nature also contains infinite wealth. If it can be widely used, China's economy will be exceptionally consolidated. Of course, we cannot just shout slogans, but we must do it in earnest. We want to explain that the high prices in the border areas are due to the underdeveloped industry. Developing industry in the interior will inevitably obtain great profits under extreme needs. As for the richness of the natives, it may be said to be gold everywhere, waiting for you to discover it.

<h3>The Road to a New Life</h3>
<p>— Tianwen</p>
<p>The cry for "relieving refugees" has failed to stimulate the hearing of the wealthy due to the prolongation of the war. Yes, the "isolated island" shows an abnormal development two years after the outbreak of the war. However, on the other hand, many enthusiastic people in the community are still actively trying to relieve them, especially those who care about orphaned and helpless children. For example, the Shanghai Relief Refugee Children's Education and Care Home recently built 28 new houses with the surplus houses of Leshan Temple, which can accommodate more than 500 refugee children. Moreover, based on the experience of disaster relief in the past two years, they know that just "raising" without "educating" will not only fail to maintain the expenses of these "old-age homes," but also develop the laziness of the refugees, making them useless. This is too far from the original intention. Especially children, in their precious golden age, should not sit idly by and allow them to become a group of social parasites in the future. Therefore, the Shanghai Relief Refugee Children's Education and Care Home takes "education" as its principle, so that these orphaned and helpless children can learn a skill and seek a foundation for establishing themselves in society in the future.</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, they have mobilized Shanghai artists to broadcast on six major radio stations in order to "adopt refugee children," "donate educational funds," and "build factories," and to appeal to the wealthy for the sake of the refugee children. It is hoped that the shouts of these enthusiastic artists can stimulate the conscience of the wealthy and complete this good deed.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also hope that donations from all walks of life will be active, so that the Shanghai Relief Poverty Children's Education Institute can expand its scope and enable all the children wandering on the streets of Shanghai to receive good education and embark on their road to a new life.</p>
