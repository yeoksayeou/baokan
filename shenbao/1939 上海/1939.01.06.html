<p>河內　外傳前國民黨副總裁汪精衛昨日乘機由河內赴港之說、已經此間法國官方吾認、汪獨居住河內近郊、其所在地、法當局嚴守秘密、注於十二月二十一日由昆明到河內後、立卽入醫院、嗣徇當地法國最高當局之請、出院另居於郊外之某別墅、在有衛兵及其親信護衛、拒絕接見任何賓客、（五日快訊社電）</p>
<p>河內　據法人方面消息、汪精衛仍寓此間某處、並未他往、前日盛傳在乘飛機赴香港、現此訊已由法國負責方面加以吾認、汪實始終匿居河內附近之某處、唯其地點祇法國人士能知之耳、河內中國總頒事館人員、自在發求和通電、並被中央開除黨籍後、卽表示與在斷絕一切關係、且對汪及其左右之行動、加以密切注意、並聞巳奉有重慶中央政府命令、對在取監視態度云、（五日快訊社電）</p>

<p>（重慶）路透記者今日探悉、郭泰祺為注精衛老友、故曾致電汪氏、指共提出和平建議、實屬錯誤力勸其收回、據向來消息靈通方面聲稱、汪氏現寓距河內約六十哩之某處、李宗仁·劉文輝·及滇湘公共團體已發表宣言、痛詆在氏、據香港華人方面消息、香港報販因南華日報乃汪精衛所辦、現相戒不販賣該報、（五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（香港）港英文南華早報四日著論題為「在精衛的失敗」、對在謬論、詳加駁斥、認汪之方張、並不能使中國不喪領土與主權、汪主張向不堅定與一致、此次備受抨擊、足徵人民對在、已失信仰、末謂在此舉、實所以鼓動漢奸、出賣祖國、而促國際對華不信任、幸已為全國所共棄、國際間亦已評定其失敗、（四日電）</p>

<h3>中日問題最近之演進</h3>
<p>昨日上海租界上空，忽有飛機翱翔，散放傳單，據聞傳單為晦澀之漢文，大旨稱：中國若干駐外使節，電陳國民政府，希望以東北割讓日本，為媾和之條件，吾則惟恐兩敗俱傷，徒為蘇俄漁利云。駐外使節責在秉承國策，折衝樽俎，斷無越職而論國策之理；自中國統一之後，內而各省疆吏，外而外交人員，皆能恪守本分，無復對於國政聯名通電之舉；故傳單云云，根本不確。更證以傳單之和戰口吻與文字技巧，允得斷言傳單必出於日人之手筆。當時市人之檢獲片紙者，乃忻然奔走相告曰：「日本勿靈兮！」我人不必根據傳單以分析日人心理，亦不必以傳單為「日本勿靈」」之有力證據；然不可不知者，二週以來，中日問題正在別開生面之中，中外人士皆應注視其演變。如十二月二十二日，日本前首相近衛，發表聲明書；旣說明日本之必不放棄其獨霸東亞，滅亡中國之野心，復以外交術語誘惑各國以冀墮彼術中。同月二十六日，中國蔣委員長表示抗戰衛國，爭取國族獨立自由之决心。歐美各國朝野對此中日之宣示，一致斥責日本而稱譽中國；同月卅一日，美國駐日大使且以抗議答復近衛。本月四日，近衛內閣解體，以極右之平沼組織新閣。同日，美國總統羅斯福氏在國會峻烈抨擊侵略國，將謀臀懲之道；英法諸國翕然。凡此重要之動態，皆將予中日問題前途以重大之影響；而在精衛之主張投降，昨日傳單之勸誘媾和，則為對華侵略之末期，世界動態之中途，日本方面所作之遊擊戰也。</p>
<p>日本以在精衛為遊擊戰，則博得世界「潮濕之爆竹」之譏評；以傳單為遊擊戰，則博得市民「日本勿靈兮」之天籟；逆料繼此二事之後，殆將尙有其他措施，謀以議和之說，動搖中國之抗戰决心，緩和國際之仗義執言。蓋日本之在華軍事以及國際外交，將陷絕境，為暴露於外之事實；而其國內財政之無以為繼，可以悍然實施全部動員法為證明。要知日本於侵略中國戰事發生後所訂動員法之內容，將使其資本家之物權，人民之人權，幾乎完全等於零；而動員法之全部實施，實無殊於其軍閥對於資本家與人民之革命行動；近衛力不足以勝此，始以極右之平沼主持國政，掌動員法，剜肉補瘡，操刀而割；苟非日本財政常軌已陷絕境，斷不行此非常法令。惟彼軍事外交與財政俱陷絕境，始於死裏逃生之術，無所不用其極；黔驢技窮，於是而在精衛與傳單，相繼現世矣。</p>
<p>自一九三七年七月七日，以迄今日，恰足十八個月；抗戰中之中國軍民，傷亡犧牲，可謂歷史所未嘗有；誰無室家，誰無生計，孰不痛心，孰樂砲火；則於此千難萬難之際，一語及於息戰，一念及於和平福利，最易使人怦然心動；顧乃近衛聲明，在精衛通電，飛機傳單，接踵而來，中國朝野竟能不為所誘者，日本亡人國，滅人國之計謀，暴露無遺，雖作和平福利之餌，誰則貪之？雖設和平福利之阱，孰則蹈之？而中國方面僅以日本停止侵略，撒兵東去為息戰之先决條件，旣忠恕至於無可復讓；不恤嚴重犧牲之悲哀與夫衛國圖存之决心，固莫得而奪之也。何况上有主持軍政之蔣委員長，最近猶詔示軍民以必戰之道，必勝之理；下有身經百戰，氣吞敵國之將領士兵，不屈不撓，再接再厲；內有敵愾同仇，拼却目前身家性命，以求子孫萬世之人民；外有助械助財，始終同情中國而近允漸决强化其制裁侵略之友邦；以此與彼軍事外交財政經濟俱陷絕境者比較觀之，誰不能繼續忍痛若干時日，以迄勝利之終點，而謂願功虧一簣，妥協投降，自趨於永永毀滅耶</p>

<h3>在華貿易遭剝奪　英人憂慮日增　商部顧問響應聶氏言論　希望政府予華更大援助</h3>
<p>（倫敦）咋日泰晤士報及每日電聞報均載有文字、可更進一步證明英國商人對於日人侵犯在華外人貿易及權利、巳日增其憂慮、棉布染織協會主席兼商部顧問委員會委員李氏、昨在泰晤士報發表一函、竭力贊成倫敦商會中國組主任聶哥森氏去年十二月廿一日在泰晤士報發表之言論、聶氏文中有云、「英國在華利益所値得公衆之注意、實遠較現時所得者為更大、」又云、「從事於對華貿易者、皆信日人之最後目的、係欲消滅遠東之一切西方勢力及企業、」復譴責英政府在華之長此容忍政策、謂英國竟容許其最大之市塲、任日本逐步消滅英國及其他外國之利益而成為日人獨佔貿易之所、實堪驚異、如英政府此項政策、不即於徒啟日人輕視並招大陸各國嘲笑之外交抗議以外有所行動而加强之、則不啻明吿英國商人以毀滅之不能避免因英國之威望、已仟其日趨低落」云、李氏鄭重發表英國在華之投資總額、共計三萬萬鎊、並以一九三八年份英美對華輸出之衰落、及日本輸出之增加兩相對照、又指出台灣朝鮮及「滿洲國」之情形、謂自日人佔據「滿洲國」以後、該處英國貿易、祇佔其總數百分之一、如日本之侵略不力遏止、則此種情形亦將發生於中國矣、吾人唯有能增加、至少亦須能維持吾人之輛出貿易、始能支付重整軍備及社會服務之鉅大擔負、至於中國、則有其廣大之可能性、貿易之大才、及和平之願望、吾人自當予以較現時更大之援助」云、基林氏亦於每日電聞報發表一文、詳細分析中日「滿」經濟同盟之資源、警吿一般人勿輕作日本財政及經濟崩潰之臆測、並鄭重宣稱、英國投資於世界各闕之金錢，除阿根廷外、當以中國為最鉅、故日本如能渡過共目下財政之難關、並成立遠東經濟同盟、則首當其衝而犧牲最大者、將縣英國云、（五日路透電）</p>

<h3>羅斯福咨文國會　抨擊獨裁國家　美决維護民治與國際信義　並願與他國恊商防止侵略　現行中立法力主加以修正</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統本日向國會親自宣讀咨文、歷時四十分鐘始畢、時為鼓掌聲所間斷、其主張修正現行中立法曁聯邦政府賡續支出巨款時、掌聲尤烈、關於維護民治制一段、則全塲一致鼓掌、迨至詞畢時、在塲之人又復高聲稱善、按外交團幾全體在座旁聽、德國代辦湯謨遜亦在其列、當羅斯福總統抨擊獨裁制、並聲明對於民治原則信守不渝時、湯謨遜聲色不動、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統頃於本日午後一時、向參衆兩院聯席會議宣讀咨文、略謂、「和平尚未奠定、美國四週現正發生軍事的或經濟的戰爭、而以威脅加諸「美國人所不缺少之三種事物、一曰宗教、二曰民治制、三曰國際誠意、其中二三兩項且係宗敎所自出、凡此三者相互為用、缺一不可、自當聯帶加以維護、「任何社會秩序凡拒不接受此三種事物者、卽不能接受基督理想、此種社會秩序、美國當予以擯絕、而保持其固有的信仰、茲有入提倡一種新哲學、惟強力是尚、此種哲學倘若控制其他各大陸、並侵入美洲大陸、則美國人當遭受何種境遇、吾人實已深知之、因此、吾人之信仰與人道觀念之敵人、未便聽其包圍吾國、此與其他各國不願受其敵國包圍初無二致、」美洲各共和國具有同樣理想、均能和平相處、並互相尊敬、殊可欣幸、此項和平此種理想首當加以維護、</p>
<p>特此幷非美洲各國與世界其他各國對峙之謂、反之、吾人仍當維持傳統的主張、願與其他各國討論防止侵略與軍備競爭之法、曁國際商業復興方法、時至今日、世界旣極狹小、各種攻勢的軍器又極為捷速、倘有一民族或有一國拒不以談判方式解决各項爭議、其他各國卽不能保障和平、進一步言之、倘有一國政府擁有龐大軍備、而惟以推行強力政策為事、則他國為保障安全計、除保有防禦的軍器而外、別無他途可循、加之新式戰爭、攻勢遠較往日為速、範圍亦愈益廣大、自當在事前預籌防禦之方、各侵略國每在發動軍事之前、出以初步的侵略、或進行宣傳或用金錢賄買或破壞良善份子之聯繫或激動各種成見或鼓動傾軋情事種種形式不一而足、</p>
<p>此在各民治國凡信仰上帝遵守各項條的、曁以誠意與他國相處者、對於違反公理之事、不論發生於何處、均未便熟視無觀、遇有姊妹國遭受侵略、波及吾人時允未便置之不問、而不切實提出抗議、……吾人雖避不使用武力以阻止侵略、但非無所作　、一若侵略並未發生也者、」茲欲以壓力加諸侵略國、除戰爭而外尚有其他方式、最低限度、無論何項舉動、甚至消極無為、凡有以援助侵略國、或增強其力量者、均當避之若浼、」現行中立法實施情形、容或失之不平等不公允甚且厚於侵略國、而薄於被侵略國、此種事態衡諸人類求生的本能、未便任其長此不變、」至是、羅斯福總統乃就一般國防政策、加以界說云、「吾人首當保有充分的軍力、一俟敵國突然襲擊各軍略地點時、卽可加以擊退、並維持抗戰力量、至最後勝利時為止、此外防禦設備亦當加以充實、俾克適應一切需要、無被敵國擊破之虞、</p>
<p>關於軍備問題、日內當向國會提出咨文、所望全國人民團結一致以固國防、至咨文第二段、乃用以討論內政問題、略謂現政府會經擬定通盤計劃、以保全國家富源、救濟貧民解决勞資爭議、充實信用制度、獎勵各項研究工作「凡此種種均巳獲有成就、初未乞靈於獨裁性質之權力、例如強制工作、限制資金、設立集中營、妨害言論自由權、違反人權宣言書所規定各種權利、」凡此一切手段、均未予以採用、」雖然、行政機構確有改組之必要、社會安全法、勞資雙方相互關係調整法、亦均有待於改良、俾資本與勞工兩者、得以互相接近、各獨裁國雖已將失業問題、游資利用問題、予以解决、但係使用強力以謀解决、美國則當採用其他方式之與現行各項原則曁人權宣言書不相遠反者、相與競爭、</p>
<p>至是羅斯福總統乃將近年以來各項成就、叙述一過、並謂美國人民之團結、與責任觀念、以視一九二九年或一九三二年均有進步至聯邦政府支出巨款、興辦事業一項政策、原亦有其充分理由、美國公私僓額、自一九二九二年以迄今日、並未提高、利息則已减低、告人茲所感受之痛苦，厥乃資本未能儘量利用、自當加以補救、」全國人民每年總收入、茲當提高至八〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元、果爾、「則失業人數、即可减少、聯邦政府各項收支、亦足以相抵、」政府茲若突然節省各項支出、危險殊甚、反之支出巨款一項政策倘全部予以維持則國民每年總收入、不難回復至八〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元、原有之數」</p>
<p>答案云、獨裁制所需代價過於巨大、决非美國人民所願償付、匪特精神價值、如神聖的言論自由權、信仰自山權旣已不復存在、即吾人所有資金、亦將悉數被沒收、吾人之子弟目不能以自由自尊的人類資格、受有教育、而將成為機器所投使之工具、要而言之、吾人為保持生存自由計、值得有所犧牲正不必求助於獨裁制云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>畢德門發表談話　贊助總統政策　對付違約國兩途可循　認有施經濟制裁必要</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統本日在國會宣讀咨文之後、參議院外交委員會主席畢德門頃發表談話稱、總統所主張之抵抗侵略國政策、應由國會加以贊助、「吾人現有兩途可循、其一各國政府凡與吾國訂有和平條的者、倘有侵犯吾國政府與公民之權利情事、吾人僅以提出抗議為了事、其二吾人在提出抗議之外、更在精神上商務上金融上加以制裁、俾此項抗議愈益有力、問題所在、端就此兩種途徑選擇其一、余信吾國政府、業已選定第二途徑、此外現行中立法實施以還、其所引起之結果、實與預期者相反、確屬實在情形」云、（四日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間今日認羅斯福總統致國會之咨文、為已回至一九三七年強硬態度之表示、國會方面指稱、總統此决對於獨裁者曾作舅敢而震怒之攻擊、並公開表示、將從經濟方面報復一般侵略國家、總統特又請國會、修改現行之中立法、俾至少在各方面、終止美國在法律上給予侵略國家便利之可能、最值得我人注意者、卽羅總統致國會之咨文、並非專對國會一體而言、乃在對全國及世界而發表意見、故於總統向國會宣讀之後、即以法義德西班牙四種語言、廣播於全世界、權威方面、認為總統之咨文、乃國防計劃基礎、窺總統之意、不僅欲保障西半球美國一國之權利而已、舉凡世界各處之侵略事件、均為美國所關懷、故就此一點而與總統之反對集權國家以觀、美國或企圖以經濟制裁在遠東之日本、雖然日本之侵略、目前尚與西半球之外人侵略無關也、政府領袖、今夜正等待民衆對總統咨文之反響、預料總統此决堅硬態度所得之擁護、當較一九三七年支加哥之演說尤為強烈、按過去十八個月中、美國在亞洲、及南非之經騐之結果、使美國一般民意、已發生尖銳之變化、至於如何制裁侵略國之實際辦法、官方不願有所洩露、大的辦法尚未確定、唯據稱、總統及其左右對於現行法律範圍內之各項方法、皆已研究完畢、明令一下、即可付之實行、同時為增加此項辦法之效力計、總統對於中立法之各主要點、皆主張大加修正、總統對於孤立派之政策、反對甚力、聲稱、「美國决不容許信仰上與我人為敵共包圍我人也」、（四日美聯電）</p>
<h3>英法歡迎　德意憤慨</h3>
<p>（倫敦）昨晚各晚報均出特刋、可為倫敦對於羅斯福總統演說殷切注意之明證、官方對此演說尚未加以評論、惟政治批評家表示意見、謂美總統之演說、可望有鼓勵歐洲民洽國家全部人民之效果、星報稱、此次演說非常坦直（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國今日對羅斯福總統中張採取強硬態度、抗敵侵略一點、表示熱烈歡迎、猶以對於羅總統咨文中有三要點、發生濃厚與趣、按三要點即（一）修改中立法、勿使侵略國家佔取便宜、（二）民主國家勿須戰爭、而予侵略者以打擊、（三）重申美國提議與各列強會商制止侵略、限制軍備及復興商業、（五日美聯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國總統羅斯福本日向該國國會宜讀咨文時、會主張修正現行中立法、此間外交界與政界人士聞訊之餘、咸皆感皆有深刻印象、並謂羅斯福總統此舉、乃進一步引導美國輿論、使之明瞭世界各國凡具有同樣理想者、必須樹立共同防綫、至中立法修正案是吾立即提出、尚不可知、此外、羅斯輻總統並在咨文中聲討各獨裁國、措詞之嚴厲、幾與美國內長伊克斯前於上月十八日所發表之演說相埒云（四日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（巴黎）美國總統羅斯福本日在該國國會所宣讀之咨文、法國政界人士一致加以好評、咸謂此乃對於各獨裁國切實的警告、其批評現行中立法一段、即所以評論歐洲時局、其說明各國凡與侵略國為鄰者、危險殊甚、尚屬第一次、此在法國素來具有此種見解、於以見美法兩國觀點愈益接近至以美國安全而論、德國在殖民地問題上所提各項要求、若果予以滿足、則該國在未來之殖民地境內所可設置之海軍根據地、即與美國領土相去不遠、自非美國之利、羅斯福總統茲已主張採取各項辦法、防止此種威脅、殊可稱道、要而言之、羅斯福總統本日所提出之咨文、語氣堅决、與美國政府前於去年十二月三十日送遠日本之照會完全相同、此層允可歡迎云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>蔣委長領導下　中國抗戰意志堅決　日本內部騷動徵象已見　郭大使在倫敦發表演說</h3>
<p>（倫敦）中國駐英大使郭泰祺昨在倫敦全國工會俱樂部演說謂、中國人民奮鬥到底、以期獲得公允垂久和平之决心、已見增強、舉國上下皆擁誰蔣委員長之領導、日本之議和條件、係欲使中國為附　之詭詐企圖、日本如不改變其對華政策之條件、則中國除繼續抗戰外，別無其他途徑、現時日本已發現內部騷動之徵象、而中國則亳無趨弱之表示、故决無屈服之可能姓云、「五日路透社電）</p>
<h3>駐巴黎使館　聲明闢謠</h3>
<p>（巴黎）一中國大使館本日發表公報稱、「上海方面謠傅中國駐法大使或大使館曾電呈蔣介石上將或國民政府、請接受日本前任首相近衛文　前於去年十二月二十二日所提出之議和提案、實非確詞、中國民族在蔣介石上將領導之下、具有最後勝利之决心、此乃　論界所深知、甚望其勿為虛偽宜傳所欺　」云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法觀察　日本政局　新內閣壽命　未必能持久</h3>
<p>（倫敦）各晚報對於日內閣辭職之消息、均用大字登載、並冠以「法西斯主義戰敗日首相」一類之標題、倫敦日人方面對近衛之辭職、均深致惋惜、謂彼在職時尚能使各方勢力平衡、並抗拒極端軍人份子最惡劣之要求、允以漢口及廣州被日方佔據後為然、近衛對於其所提對華議和條件之失敗、頗感失望、因彼對之具有甚大之希望、故此事大約為其辭職之最後原因、據稱、新仟首相平沼係屬激烈國家主義派並為極端分子聞在日本並不受人歡迎、前日相相池田之退休、頗為遺憾、因一般人皆認其為任藏相之最幹練人選也、倫敦日人方面對於何人將繼任藏相、頗為憂慮、據此間預測、日本政友及民政兩大政黨對於軍部方面擬按照法西斯方式祖織新政黨之計畫、必將力加奮鬥、一如一九三六及一九三七年之春秋兩季然、因上述計畫「旦實現、則事實上將使國會成為廢物、大的兩黨作此奮鬥、或將獲得日本人民之擁護云、據精密之觀察家聲稱、新閣亦未能垂諸永久、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）近衛內閣辭職之後、法國各報頃加以評論多謂此乃日本軍部極端派獲有大勝之謂、美日兩國緊張關係、定必愈益嚴重、其中極右派小日報載稱、一日本軍部欲進行全面戰爭、不許成立妥恊方案、美國為保衛國際法、維護本國利益計、勢必被迫而與日本鬥爭、盎格魯撒克遜集團與各全能國集團之大比賽、茲已開始、急進社會黨共和報載稱、「美國對於日本態度、較為強硬之後、實足以重大助力、加諸中國、日本軍部極端派或立即接受此種挑釁、正未可必、特日本之兵力與資源、日見匱乏、與論日見不安、實亦不能不加以顧慮、」石派自由報載稱、「現行戰事　續進行若干時日之後、恐無結束之期、此乃日本所深懼、亟望有以終止之、「反之、中國軍事委員長蔣介石上將與中國人民抗戰决心、日益堅反、」共產黨人道報戰稱、平沼內閣乃一「過渡內閣」、而以廣續推行前首相近衛之政策為事、此一內閣、究能維持至幾何時日、殊難加以揣測、所可知者、其壽命之短長、當以英法美三國對於德義日集團態度如何以為斷一云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）關於日本內閣之改組、此間負責人士均認為係法西斯派之勝利、蘇俄官方塔斯通訊社指陳近衛之辭職、係受軍人之壓迫、蓋軍人派以日本未能摧毀將介石上將、歸咎近衛也、（五日海通電）</p>
<h3>美國人士　紛加評論　經濟制裁日本　時機業已成熟</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）日本近衛內閣總辭職、樞密院議長平沼騏一郞奉命組閣之後、美國負責人士頃加以評論、咸謂其人足以代表日本法西斯主義派、其繼任首相也、乃欲組成賡續作戰與徵略土地所必須之內閣、此際倘以經濟制裁手段加諸該國、其效力自必甚大、至以美國在華所保有之利益而論、日本一方面旣已採取各項岐視辦法、一方面又將香港與廣州市暨中國內地之交通予以切斷、中美兩國商務實際上業已陷於停頓、美國政府或當電召駐日大使格魯返國述職、俾就羅斯福總統在其咨文中所倡導之政策、即以強硬手段對付各侵略國一項政策、磋商實施方式、亦未可必云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日閣更迭　柏林注視　認戰事結束無欺</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國對於日內閣之辭職及新閣之組織、均非常注意、並表示意見、認為此次內閣之更迭、將愈增日本外交政策之力量、同時德官方對於此事尚無批評、以待新閣之完成、柏林日報載稱、一近衛之辭職、似可　明日本各報去年底所發之言論、即　二九三丸年將為統一外交政策、及海陸外交三方面政策融合之年」是、檢討近衛內閣之歷史、可見其對於統一外交政策之第一要求、仍未實　云（五日路透實）</p>
<p>（柏林）日本近衛內閣總辭職之後、　密院議長平沼　郎業奉命組閣、德國政界人士評論甚盛、咸謂平沼素以一日本法西斯主義之父」見稱、至以中日兩國戰事而論、日本雖在軍事上佔有優勢、但因汪精衛主和通電、業由中國方面一致拒絕之故、戰事結束殆　遙無期云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>大湖遊擊隊　程萬軍降日之經過　程部現駐湖濱無惡不作</h3>

<p>自馬蹟山抗戰後、程萬軍駐司令部於陸家港、經過半月之收編、仍然恢復以前之力量、斯時計有田文龍·孫子淸·曹　慶·曾洪。王淸順、等部隊、人數的四千餘人、但其中長官士兵、腐化及行為不良者極多、甚或公然作土匪式的惡行、程部之政治領導者為金魯望、金乃一失意政客、終日沉迷「雀戰、」置政訓工作於不顧、且徒知滿足其私生活、而以敷衍陰謀之手段、朦蔽靑年、六月間、金組織政訓處、自任處長、但在尚未佈置就結時、　又成立「稅務局、」計有特稅。屠宰。捲烟營業。酒稅。雜稅。鹽稅。牙稅。船泊。絲捐等在十種以上、徵收稅率之高、實屬目無國法、湖濱一帶、東起橫　、西至大錢，按月估計可收七八千元之數、除此捐款外、並通令民衆負担者、有月捐。住戶捐。地方維持捐等、此種捐款、另有經濟會葉某主持徵收、以鄉鎭估計、每月可收八九千元、以一萬七八千元之維持尚不心足、對於各部隊駐在鄉村中、尚要民衆担負伙食、</p>

<p>現在湖濱一帶、自程萬軍降日後、苛捐雜稅、仍繼續進行徵收、同時金魯望又成立什麼「抗敵糧食後援會一、徵收田賦捐、每畝徵收國幣一元四角、並另行徵收每畝白米二　、所以農民一年勞苦所得、金魯望竟抽其大半、并聞此决程之降敵、得日方撥款每月數萬元、乃苛捐雜稅、非但不能廢除、反而以「抗敵後援之名、」來囊括民衆之血汗、此種剝削民衆之妄為，誠堪痛恨、程部現留駐在湖濱一帶之部隊、有曹純慶。孫子淸。兩部、曹純慶駐在吳漊、孫子淸駐在陸家港、若輩專以「出發」為名、拉夫至各鄉村中間搶刦、因此湖濱一帶、稍有飯吃者、都為若輩洗刦一空、農民在白天不敢至吳漊、陸家港、夜間睡在田畔旁邊、以防拉夫補充隊伍、在此初冬嚴寒之際、無不呌苦連天、</p>

<p>上海特輯</p>
<h3>大上海十年紀略</h3>
<p>— 宣南</p>
<p>上海市成立於民國十六年七月七日，初名上海特別市，直隸於國民政府，經任黃郛為本市第一任市長。黃市長就職後卽根據國民政府所頒布之上海特別市暫行條例，委任秘書及各局局長，分別接收各機關，先後成立秘書處暨財政·工務·公安·衛生·公用·教育·士地·農工商·公益等九局以管理市政，並擬訂各項規章，公布施行，以資遵守：又擬定本市區域範圍，呈請國民政府轉飭江蘇省政府派員會同查勘，以明管轄而淸權限。黃市長就任甫及二月，以舊疾復發而請吿退。國民政府乃任命張定璠繼任市長，於九月十六日視事。張市長為樽節行政經費計，於九月底將公益局裁撤，所有該局主管事務，按其性質，分別移交其他各局辦理，嗣卽着手分劃省市權限，確定市行政區域範圍，接收上寶兩縣各市鄉，一律改稱為區域。</p>
<p>民國十七年七月三日，國民政府公布特別市組織法，市政府方面卽於八月一日起，遵照實行改組，除將農工商局改稱為社會局，其餘各處局均仍照舊外，並於十二月二十五日成立港務局，辦理本市河港·岸綫·碼頭·船舶等事宜。</p>
<p>民國十八年三月，張市長亦因病辭職，繼任者為張羣。張市長於四月一日就職後，注意於整理改造舊市區固有之建設，並劃定市中心區域，努力促進孫總理大上海計劃之實現。翌年五月二十日，國民政府公布市組織法，改定各特別市名稱為市，直隸於行政院，市政府方面卽於同年七月一日起，遵照改稱為上海市，並實行改組。除港務局奉令緩設，於同年十二月裁撤外，略略改變各處局之內部組織，而名稱一仍其舊。民國廿年七月七日，市中心區市政府新廈舉行奠基典禮，興工建築，原定於决年完竣。嗣因時局變遷，張市長於决年一月，因病辭職而去。</p>
<p>民國廿一年一月七日，吳鐵城奉命繼任市長。吳市長就職未久，卽遇一二八之中日戰事發生，遷延三月有餘，市區精華，摧毀甚巨，乃經救濟災區，撫輯流亡，殫精竭慮，勉渡難關。同時，鑒於市區範圍之遼闊，治安為難，於同年八月一日成立市保安處，對於復興善後工作，及完成市中心區域之建設，仍繼續邁進，以求實現大上海之計劃。翌年十月，市政府大廈落成，吳市長卽定於國慶日上午十時舉行落成典禮。十二月市政府卽遷入辦公。</p>
<p>民國二十三年元旦，市政府舉行開幕典禮，同時慶祝民國成立紀念，並舉行擴大紀念團及新年團拜禮。又為促進市中心區繁榮計，對於近代都市所應有之各種設備，亦一一開始從事晉行，除放寬道路，開關公園以供市民便利遊憇以外，其他如圖書館·博物館·運動場·體育館·游泳池·醫院·衛生試騐所·小學校·無綫電播音台·虬江碼頭等等重要工程均次第興築。</p>
<p>民國廿四年，圖書館·博物館·體育場·醫院·衛生試騐所·小學校等，均已先後完成。小學校卽於二月內開校，體育場卽在九月內，移交於第六屆全國運動大會籌備委員會，在十月十日至廿日，開第六屆全國運動大會，市中心區車水馬龍，盛極一時。大會閉幕後，由市政府接管，並核定組織規程後，卽實行開放，以為市民運動競技之場所。自民國廿五年至上海淪陷前圖書館·博物館·醫院·衛生試騐所等均設備布置完竣先後開幕。體育場內又設立上海市市立體育專科學校。虬江碼頭第一期建築工程，亦吿完成而先行開業。其他建設事業，如建設龍華風景區，創設浦東水廠及上海電話局擴充市中區用戶綫等均着着實現或晉行中，豈知上海市成立紀念之七月七日，竟為倭所選定製造事變作為對華侵略戰之一日，更豈知距蘆溝橋事變後一月餘，上海戰事亦卽吿爆發乎！當三月間，廣東省主席逝世，國民政府命吳市長繼任主席，上海市長一職仍卽由俞鴻鈞代理。戰事勃發後，俞氏牽命為市長，指揮市民共起抗敵。抗戰凡四閱月而上海竟吿淪陷。然上海市民民氣至今不衰，咸信最後勝利定屬我國，而大上海亦終必將為上海中華人士所光復，大上海之復興，仍必將為中華人士親手所經營所完成者也。</p>
<h3>日圖擅改華北關稅　英總領提備忘錄　日圖增稅英决不承認　必要時採取報復策略</h3>
<p>日方企圖修改華北關稅、增高英美進口貨物之稅率、壟斷遠東貿易市場、種種陰謀、不惜處心積慮、期諸實施、本市英美駐滬總領事署、均奉命調查、所得報吿甚詳、美總領事並已於日前提出抗議、制止日方此項侵害第三國利益之行動、措詞頗為嚴峻、茲悉駐滬英總領事、昨日亦向日方提出備忘錄、大意謂日方如圖擅改華北關稅、英國方面、决不同意承認、如因此事而發生種種嚴重後果、其一切資任、當由日本方面負之、並謂日方如不放棄此項排外政策、英國在必要時、决聯合其他各國、採取報復策略、</p>

<h3>華茶　運銷進展　港滬外銷　平分秋色</h3>
<p>茶葉為我國特產、每年出口頗鉅、戰後內外運銷、改由財部貿易會實行統制後、產銷均告增加、經濟部推行邊省種茶、指定茶區、分別實行，茲將戰後之茶葉運銷出口貿易變動詳情分誌如决、</p>
<p>戰后運銷　完全統制</p>
<p>華茶對外貿易、向由出各洋行與洋莊茶號交易、而洋莊茶號所須茶葉、則於新茶上市時派員入山收買、運滬推銷、皖贛兩省府、在戰前雖曾一度統制紅茶運銷、由產地運滬交易、但自戰事發生後、財政部貿易調整委員會、即實行統制全國紅綠茶內外運銷組設富華貿易公司、收買全國茶葉、直接向外推銷、一掃戰前各種流弊、實惠茶農、發展外銷收效頗著、</p>
<p>滬　兩地　平分秋色</p>
<p>貿易調整委員會實行統制茶銷、首先本規定紅綠茶葉、概須集中香港交易、嗣經滬市洋莊茶葉公會請求、為維護各茶棧營業計、乃由貿易會評定甲乙等級、規定甲種必須運港、乙種准許結滙運滬、由茶棧自由與洋行交易故統制後之茶葉外銷、據海關統計，滬市今年出一月至十一月輸出總額、達一千三百零三萬七千二百五十七元、香港由一月至九月出口總額、為一千一百二十一寓六千七百四十七元、可謂滬港兩地、平分秋色、</p>
<p>內外交易　變動一斑</p>
<p>莫阿姨調整委員會實行統制茶葉運銷後、富華貿易公司即在港開盤交易、所有上海設莊之紅綠茶商、因一時不易搬遷便派代表一人駐港、專司過磅收銀等事、洋行如須購貨、得向富華公司交易、該公司實為一最有力量之茶葉機關、至於乙種茶運滬、則大都集中溫州、滬上洋莊茶棧為便利結售外滙、辦理運銷等、特在溫成立聯合辦事處、主持一切、乙種茶運滬後、各洋行即可向各洋莊照常交易、</p>
<p>產量轉佳　外銷增加</p>
<p>本年浙贛皖等省茶葉產量均佳、查往年祁紅及寗紅產量、不過八萬箱、本年經富華公司收買運港者、達十一萬八千箱、平水綠茶過去年產的二十萬箱、本年亦增為廿五萬箱、外銷方面、富華公司統制之紅綠茶、其中多數受主為蘇聯、其他則以英國最多、美國决之、德國亦有、蓋實施統制後、外銷茶葉力求改良、頗能迎合歐美人士胃口、故外銷數額較前增加、</p>

<h3>「字說自話」</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>「自說字話」這句話，最初抵是一般賣笑者考拿來拒絕治游者要求用的、看來很淺俗，而且有些不通，但它的內涵却很深刻：它是含有菲薄對方，　視對方的用意的，所以也是「狂妄」或「夢　」的代名詞</p>
<p>冶遊的朋友，他們出了相當的代價，找到了某一個對象，我們不必究問他們的實際用心何在，是風雅，抑是齷齪？最低限度，他們終希望能够獲得對象的一笑，所謂「千金買笑」，應該是冶遊者的目的之一。然而那班賣笑的女人們，有的故示矜貴，不肯輕易一笑，有的內心羞愧，不敢多言敷衍，冷冰冰的坐在一旁，有問方有答，買笑者處在這種塲合，自然要覺得怪沒趣的，為要達到冶遊的目的，調和當時的空氣，不得不想出許多挖裹挖刻，古裹古怪，齷裹齷齪的話來，撥動對方的心絃，逗引對方的粲笑。因此，熊度難免會輕在，言語難免會刻薄。對方遭遇着這種環境，明知被侮辱，被調侃，但以身份關係，不便反目或者辨難，祇當他在說夢話，而告誡以：「不要自說自話」、拒絕得一乾二淨</p>
<p>上海人是挺宗明的，不僅吸收性高强，而且傅佈力也很敏捷；同時「自說自話」的朋友和「自說自話」的事實也太多了，所以這句話，不多時，便在各級社會中流行了。</p>
<p>現在凡是過份的要求，誇張的說詞，無理的辨難，都可以聽得。：「不要自說自話」的答復。</p>
<p>其實，一般社會間固然多的是「自說自話」的朋友和「自說自話」的事實，卽是在國際間也盛行這種作風。不過，祗有無恥的，下賤的，意志薄弱的，認識糢糊的纔會中計人彀。</p>
<h3>年糕市場卽景</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>在耶誕的時節，年糕由塲早已展開了。國曆新年一到，年糕市塲像是受了刺激，特別的　鬧起來。由月餅市塲而蟹市塲，自蟹市塲而年糕市塲，新陳代謝，每一個季節有每一種應時的食物，商人對於時令是冉不會忘懷的。</p>
<p>年糕市塲上，風頭出得挺健的恐怕是寗波年糕吧。許多做年糕的人，借了半間門面，擺了一張長方的桌　，幾個做糕的八，一天到晚是忙着揑做寗波年糕。</p>
<p>寗渡年糕的製法很簡單，用粳米帶水磨碎，蒸熟之後，在石日裹打過了，放在桌檯上搓得黏了，就可擺在印板裹面，印成一條條的年糕。所以每一個年糕攤子的面前，總是掛出了一塊寫着「上白水磨年糕」的字樣的牌子。</p>
<p>雖然是一角門面，今年房租貴啦，也要幾十元一月的租金。所幸米價不貴，做米糕還是不失為一種短時期的好賣買。自冬至起，到廢暦新年為止，往年吧，大概年糕市祇有短短三四十天，可是今年，冬至到廢曆年夜，有十足兩個月之久，年糕市無形的展長了，加着孤島上住民的擠居，年糕的銷塲，不會例外，一定要比往年多，所以年糕攤，三步一家，五步一個，也特別熱鬧。</p>
<p>現在，年糕的市價，每兀市秤十七斤。雖然祗擺一個攤子，兩個月的年糕市，有的也要做幾千元的生意。做年糕的工人，不一定是寗波人，本地人佔居多數，每人的工資，自十餘元至二十多元一月不等。除了年糕之外，有的攤子，早上還耍賣年糕糰，就用蒸熟的糕粉，放些豆沙，百果，做　子，搓在年糕糰中，生意也不差。</p>
<p>不僅是臨時擺起來的年糕攤子，就是糕　店，這幾天也都在忙着做寗波年糕。所謂寗波年糕，可以用肉絲炒了當點心吃，更可燒菜，不限寗波人，而今住在上海的各地的人，都愛吃的。所以寗波年糕，在上海吧，也一年到頭有着的，祇是歲尾年頭，年糕上市的時節，特別活　罷了。</p>
<p>除了寗波年糕之外，在上海，蘇式的，廣式的糖年糕，也相富的活躍。糖年糕是用糯米製成的，這幾天茶食店，南貨店，以及南京路上的幾家糕　店，你看那一家不是堆滿了糖年糕，葷的，素的，白糖的，紅搪的，玫現的，蛋黃的，豬油的，夾沙的，花樣繁多，不勝枚舉。冠生園，泰康，櫥窗裹的廣式豬油年糕，也出現了，更有各種年糕盒。四大公司，也另闢一部，出售年糕。</p>
<p>還有高橋年糕，紹興年糕，花樣很多，祇是沒有上面所說的寗波年糕，蘇式，廣式糖年糕的暢銷而已。事實告訴我們，年糕是廢暦新年的一筆龐大的消費。而龐大的消費又何止這一種，所以，我們還是老套話，請「孤島一人士，無時無地勿忘「節的救難」。</p>
<h3>恐怖世界</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>（IAMTheLaw）</p>
<p>哥侖比亞出品大光明戲院映</p>
<p>說起來還是一套老話，這是一部和gMEN型相　相弼的影片。換一句話說，就是美國政府為肅淸盜匪，安定社會的電影政策下的出品之一；這樣的治一下標，是吾能把盜匪就此肅淸了？是吾能把社會安定下來？這是一個疑問，（我的答案則是吾定的），然而在「藍鷹」的電影政策下類此的影片我們已看了不少則是事實。</p>
<p>一恐怖世界是說一個一生性鲠直，嫉惡如仇一的法學教授約翰，如何犧牲他的假期而帮助政府作安定社會工作的故事。這故事，我是歡喜的，我歡喜的倒並不在於他的如何出力剷除痞氓——在製作的目的是向「生性鲠直的法學教授呼籲，請他們出而與政府合作安定社會；地點換了在上海開映，此時此地，我們若換一種眼光，以不畏強暴，奮鬥到底來看，則也未始沒有若干意義。——是的，和強暴者堅决的戰鬥下去是一個很好的課題。我歡喜的是劇作者那種用正面來寫的創作方法，以及的翰的那種生性鲠直，堅定地勇往直前排除萬難的性格。為這樣堅定的性格所鼓動，又且作者是用正面來寫他的，他使人有了和強暴者搏鬥下去的勇氣。固然，攝製者的目的並非為了此時此地的「孤島」上的我們，而在故事的發展上，也難免有太「巧」的地方，但一個戲在某一地個方某一個時間內開映，和時間空間是分不開來的，正如羅克的「古董教授」，牠本身難、不是辱華片，但我們却不會忘記他主演過辱華的「不怕死」和一萬能市長一。一張片子我們應該問其攝製的目的，但也同時更應該指出它的客觀效果，道樣的看法，淺知者固然以為這父是說到了片子的以外，但在我們，却堅决地認為這眞是一題內」的事情。</p>
<p>現在把話題拉到「恐怖世界」的演出部門來。</p>
<p>這個戲的導演方面，我是歡喜的，亞歷山大海爾很能明確而有力地控制戲的進展，它瞭解劇本的編製，所以能統一地表達戲的重心所在。我固然不同意一個戲的基點放在一個人身上，使得戲的發展因為這個角色的發展，他所處的背景反而為他的附從，但在這個戲裹，不能抹煞的，却有他的好處，那就是如上面我所說的，作者是把他正面地雕＝塑（不是描畫）出一個正直堅定的性格，而這樣的性格却是使我們感動，增加了和強暴者門爭下去的勇氣。</p>
<p>導演者的號處，就是充分地發揚了這好處：而於微細的地方，如那位約翰教授時常把燃着的烟斗放到口袋裏，使得口袋冒煙，以及利用狗的阻撓暴徒人　刺激館來的情籍等。</p>
<p>其中太「巧」的地方，那則是劇本上的緣故，例如暴徒入室，約翰恰巧去拿玩弄等。福格森的登車自殺，則是因為其子保羅「法理精湛，少年老成」的「人情」在作祟，正如說明書中所云：「維護愛子保羅之名譽的緣故，劇作者旣要為「肅清匪徒，安定社會」的電影政策而「大義滅親」，又為維護愛子保羅之名譽」起見，自然抵號這樣來不樂而了之。</p>
<p>愛德華羅資遜的戲是好的，老練穩定，一如他以前所演的各片，尤其是兩隻手的運用，充分顯示出他的有力，其他如發音和臉部的戲，則還在其决。</p>

<h3>兩過靑</h3>
<p>— 包天</p>
<p>第一回　獨臂翁組織自由村　雙胞女禮瞻先烈墓再說到朱老源設立的私塾，他和那種新興的學校章程，原是不合的。他原是唱獨脚戲，只有一個人在那裹亂囔亂跳，又沒有人帮他的忙。後來縣裹派了視學員來了，那種學校不像學校，私塾不像私塾的，自然不人視學員之眼。當然這也不對，那也不對，要挑剔起來，什麽也不對了。視學員的意思：以為當小學教員的，總要　點教育，因問朱老源：「你是什麼學校裹的出身」？朱老源睜大了兩個眼睛道：「我那些有什麼學校出身！我是掮鋤頭，挖爛泥的出身。我並不要教什麼書，怎麼你們只在城裹開設學堂，鄉下也不來開設個小學，難道鄉下人合該愚魯，不配讀書嗎？收起鄉下人的捐來，倒也怪好聽的，也有教育附捐等名，鄉下人究竟得着些什麽好處呢」？那視學員被他搶白了一塲，倒也無話可答。及至後來，那地方合併數村，設了一個小學校。但有些人，還願意要朱老源教村中的兒童，朱老源却辭謝了，說；一我到底是不行的，從前因為近村沒有學堂，看看小孩子們，只在田角落裏，墳山窠裹，跑來跑去，沒人理會。覺得一個人識幾個字，總是自己的便宜，所以收幾個學生來教教。但我自己也是知識有限，旣然有了小學校，還是到小學校去。雖然比較路遠一點，鄉下孩子，那怕跑路呢」？他雖不教書，小茶館裹，還是去的。這小茶館是他們聚會之所，也是他們討論之所。一直到民國二十六年，中日開戰以後，這個村子，也遭了淪陷了。所有小茶館，以及全村都被燒光了。朱老源率領了村中一班少年，組織了游擊隊，與敵軍相　，　　　　　。有一次，他率領了他部下的精壯少年，四人餘人，在某鐵路的沿綫，想截斷敵軍的後路，刦奪他們的糧械。那時候，正是月黑風凄，有些細雨濛溕的夜裹。他們預先把鐵路上那一段的軌道，掘去了六匕丈，派人四面埋伏了，一聲口號，伏者齊起，使敵兵有國措手不及。可是這一次，勝利是勝利了，我們那位忠舅的鄉下先生朱老源，却受了重傷了。（五）</p>

<p>證券暗盤、昨日為新年紅盤之第一日、中間經過四日之休假、政周震　頗烈、在精衛之荒謬通電、已不發生任何影響、市塲人心已比較安定、暗盤初開時、大戶多頭故意散佈謠言、或謂此决發息恐有變更、或謂發行新建設公債五萬萬、一般盲　者、不加考慮、各數戶隨　一號爭先求售、開價竟比年前壓小一元之鉅、樂茂號吸收最力、各帮零星戶亦紛紛買進、三十八號抬價允勁、市價竟又轉高甚驟、午前結果有漲無跌、午後一般放空者已知受愚、紛紛抵補、漲風頓見激烈、尤以五號及同康號搜購最猛、價乃猛烈上騰、甲種在漲、結果竟又穿出上年十二月二十四日六十二元一角之最高價、再見六十二元四角新紀錄、高低相差二元之鉅、此種反跌為漲之變動、完全為買賣雙方之一種手段、故久無升降之九六、形勢亦見轉優、依目下環境及人心視察、當屬漲面為多、惟亦微嫌其過暴耳、結果一律上漲一元至一元三角五分、九六亦好五角半、成交總數、的七十萬元之左右、茲列簡明表於後、股票行盤、尚未開市、</p>

<h3>雜糧　麩皮開盤漲二角</h3>
<p>麩皮開盤、市氣續承上年底之光榮、行情比休假前足漲二角餘、昨計福新廠大包麩為二元九角半、阜　廠大包麩為二元七角半、棧租問題因客歲十一月份之棧單尚未見出貨、故廠方已决行增加、但市氣仍少影響、惟去路實銷暫取觀望、祇囤戶問津五千餘包、刻下廠方殊少供給、故市勢依然穩固、</p>
<h3>紗花　客帮房價收買　紗市扶搖直上　突跳四元至九元之鉅　成交二千六百四十包</h3>
<p>紗花紅盤交易昨巳開始、市價承上年歲暮、穩定基礎、價格續向前進、各紗一律突跳四元至九元之巨、棉布疋頭亦漲二角、蓋以華南潮汕滇帮需要不懈、同時浙東溫台甬諸帮亦有同樣步驟、此項消息本報兩日前已誌預測、因各方對於粗細紗採辦接踵而來、人心十分振奮、市價乃扶搖直上、至於同業心思堅靱、因原料被某方壟斷、不能下跌、廠方成本增加、且獲利日薄、故吸收之舉不絕、所以每日同業成交熱鬧非凡、昨開盤以新年休假中、各方皆有採辦之念、開市客帮首先入塲放價收辦、因此市價一跳五·六元之譜、雲甫汕頭兩帮進胃甚健、台溫甬亦步塵於後、故市價越做越好、結果各帮貿去統計二千六百四十包、上日午後成交一百四十包、合計二千七百八十包、行淸二十支特金城漲七元、雙馬漲四元牛、三星漲九元、牧羊漲七元，雙地球漲八元、十六支十支粗紗亦漲四元至六元、廠方由申新開出十支得利二百包、價二百六十元、崇信廠開出十支大發二百六十包、價二百八十元、新中國廠開出二十支五子二百包、價二百六十元、永安廠開出二十支特金城一百六十包、價為三百七十元、新裕廠開出二十支雙地球一百五十包、價為三百五十九元、茲將各帮口買去之額量如左、</p>
<p>日紗市情、因華紗步步昂騰、人氣略為帶緊漲一元、但實需呆滯如故、二十支水月紗現出價為三百零二是那元、本”份為三百零一元、二十支藍鳳紗現出價為三元、本月份價為二百九十九元、</p>
<h3>紗銷旣暢　原棉廠需益覺發展　姚衣做開一萬五千包　外棉華廠昨未聞訂講</h3>
<p>本棉生意益覺發展、蓋以邇來棉紗棉布銷塲既暢而售價轉高、各廠對於原料、當然有意補進、因此紅盤交易亦稱熱鬧也、但仍以白包花粗絨棉成交獨佔優勢姚衣及火機最為俏俐、統益·崇信兩廠採辦十支原料姚衣巨量購進一萬五千包、鴻章安達各進五百包、故市價驟漲一元外、通花亦張一元外、不過此貨身骨堅潔、惟細絨棉仍被印棉壓殺、市態較遜、日廠時有採納、碼頭上通州花到貨寥　無幾、僅八百八十包、惟姚花到一萬五千八百包、新裕廠購訂印棉二百包、係三十二支原料、售價僅八十八元、又訊姚花後批仍有巨額抵滬、均手續業巳辦理完竣、來源暢達决無問題、又昨由新港來棉花二百五十件、北沙來四百四件、白茆楊林來三百五十件、茲將各方售開現棉之價格並額量如左</p>
<p>外棉市償、紐的美棉市先因晨初之一部份獲利了結、市况較疲、下跌五六磅昔、後因羅斯福總統之咨文、對於今後之農衆問題、除有數小點略有修正外、其餘仍照前定計劃實施、故各同業心思因而轉堅、現貨交易及各廠進胃仍進步之象、昨紐的跌二三音、印度連同頂測跌一五餘、埃及漲五六磅音、昨日滙兌無甚軒輊、合法幣、外棉價校之假前每担供漲四元角、</p>
<p>本市外棉交易、今日各廠雖已全部辦公、昨日紗價、紅盤又漲四五元、交易數千包、然外棉交易反呈冷落之象、此或因各華廠堅拒訂購外棉所致也、唯盛傳申新現與某巴西棉進口洋行、暗中訂購巴西棉數百包、付款條件為先付定銀一成、尙餘九成、俟輪抵埠後、再一成定銀、為數雖微、果有此舉、亦應念及同業利害、如各華廠能始終團結一致、採取集體行動、能抱有「即在必要時寗願停工、拒購外棉」之精神、各洋行無有不屈服者、茲將昨日現貨市價及交易件額分列於後、</p>

<h3>糖市　汕綿白號盤喊高</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢穩定、公會劃盤二四荷粗白轉口貨以十六元二角半劃出四百包、現貨無更動、太古車白B嘜浦西棧二十四元、國產汕綿白號盤雖喊漲、但未成交、奇白仍開十八元半至十七元半、枝洋一百包、十五元四角、高貨呌十六元、决汕赤百餘包、開十二元七八角、東海赤數十包、十二元、普通黃崗靑開出千數包、十一元六七角、隆港靑十元二角、興化糖開出明京赤、前後共五百餘包、十四元三角、刁靑原價無上落、續有開出、聞新貨以產價難劃、尚乏運申云、惟今日有糖一千包由港來轉靑島、</p>
<h3>糧食　現粉北銷獨健　小麥貨主扳價</h3>
<p>粉昨為今庚初决開盤、各廠在年假期中，除一度修理機件外、對於國麥原料、亦有少數之準備、故生產數量、較前略增、惟存粉依然不充、尚乏大量之供給、市盤因之逐見喊高、客方則嫌價高、亦無意多取、結果售開綠兵船·綠砲車·紅藍車·等二號粉三萬餘包、價四元九角、比前盤見升五分、除本街零批的有八千包外、其餘北帮為大宗、南帮决之、尚有紅財神紅桃花一萬五六千包、價四元三角半、紅藍漁翁三四千包、價四元四角半、悉由津帮及秦皇島等處辦去、下脚粉缺貨無市、</p>
<p>麥連日來源逐有，在假期四天中、到貨的有四萬餘包大都直接配廠、其價均與年尾終盤相仿、故市上求售者不多、且粉價又高、貨主扳價愈烈、結果比客歲價盤高四五分、計由福新廠辦去一萬包、阜　廠辦去五千包、江北麥最高價已達六元六角五分云、</p>
<h3>粳米銷場轉滯</h3>
<p>昨日國米來源、共抵河下貨四艘、而白茆　及滸浦口運來原包六七千包、本街及囤戶悉鮮問津、故人心較綏、各貨頓呈供過於求之勢、客戶都思做低、但售方因所到之貨、身本供重、扳持殊力、以故梗米雖成交不夥、而厚薄粳僅略疲數分、杜洋尖埠尖應求相埒、未見榮辱、陰　又告斷貨、變元亦以缺貸獨俏、挺秀數分、</p>
<p>今日有米四千〇五十包出口、係香港裝來轉運天津、又二千二百九十包、自香港來轉靑島、</p>
<h3>疋頭　川滇動辦春令貨　湘贛商業日漸恢復　又在溫台大量採辦</h3>
<p>國布昨新年開盤、以業中心思多數看漲、囤貨意與加　、各貨售盤均看上趨之勢、尤以申新水安二廠出品細布·細斜漲風最聚、每疋加二角至四角、粗布平平、綸昌花布·色丁，藍布亦張一二角、　以湘·贛我軍陣地穩固、商業日漸恢復、故又集中溫甬台各口大量採　，細布　　胃獨健、成交白貨細布·細　，粗布五百餘件·　布·染色·印花　頭近二百箱、溫台帮辦法細布·細　·粗布·色布亦達三百餘件、本埠批發號囤胃亦佳、成交綸昌廠出品花布·藍布等往浙贛內地由溫　轉運、常德帮囤進細布·細　一百餘件、川·　帮淺色春令貨成交票布·府綢·洋紗·色子貢·標準布二千　　、港·汕帮百貨雖有添辦、以貨價過高、尙隨　合、預訂各貨報裝仍盛、閩帮因須重訂入口登記辦法　輸運暫停、郵件仍有寄出、</p>
<p>東貨晨市平疲、下午因實銷汪盛、貨盤轉緊、細布·細　較去年底盤每　約漲五分之七分半、龍頭·彩球·陽鶴三牌細布售開十元〇八角半至九角、同業然　及客路銷納成交約二千件、洋行開貨亦近千件、十二磅飛俞細布訂開十元元、龍頭彩球十元〇九角半、雙魚十元〇五角、喇叭童十元〇五角半、每　俱高出市價五分以上、故市勢趨堅、</p>
<h3>油餅　烟岐最為昂貴</h3>
<p>豆油及花生油、均提升二角、實屬休假五日、辦胃見健之故、但洋行拋盤仍股、故共正式市態、須看今市銷塲能吾暢聯為目標、昨計本街成交膠州花生油五十件、（行情請參觀市價欄）、寗波去靑島聽生油三百四十聽、現大連豆油三百桶·訂一月上七十桶、一月下五十桶、二月上由洋行拋出四百桶、决色現油成交三十桶、訂一月下交二百桶、其他烟歧開一百件、行情獨漲四角、訂十天內交亦做開一百件云、</p>

<p>金針菜、　以來源已到、堅漲之勢漸平、而港粵　等帮去胃亦稍减、號方開盤比前略鬆、連日成交不多、行盤較高者為三十四五元、次之三十一元至二十四五元不一、預訂條肥色艷而身千者照加、</p>
<h3>藥材　山甲片漲後略軟</h3>
<p>山甲票會以到貨稀少、因之市勢一再上漲、如上　貨每担意漲至二百六十元、次之二百三十元、迄於目前去路轉　、惟來源仍覺、而底存亦罕、故已呈平定之象、</p>

<h3>歸客</h3>
<p>— 邱竹師</p>
<p>風雪沈沈柴門暮。</p>
<p>荒寂的古津渡</p>
<p>有千里外的歸客繫泊。</p>
<p>繞一圈籬落，依然</p>
<p>橘柚護寒烟；</p>
<p>認主人家游龍草離披</p>
<p>——黯淡的門楣。</p>
<p>一串淚珠夾一串心跳，</p>
<p>萬里鞋啃住階石的蒼苔，</p>
<p>從漫天烽火中歸來，</p>
<p>又平靜地叩到了家園平靜的柴門。</p>
<p>白髮飄蕭，</p>
<p>依稀是夢中相見。</p>
<p>然而有照壁燈影，</p>
<p>給驚喜的老淚以銀光閃爍。</p>
<p>照耀素壁，這熟習的素壁，燈</p>
<p>在紅燄中開了燈花。</p>
<p>（開花的燈照着母親開花的心。）</p>
<p>恣聽歸客驚險的訴說，</p>
<p>母親，浣盡一年來惓念的苦辛。</p>
<p>「爬山汽車發了瘋，</p>
<p>盤上蒼翠的峯巒。</p>
<p>這里，可以呼上帝而告之，</p>
<p>說：有一羣逃難的</p>
<p>羔羊乞求憫憐。</p>
<p>然而上帝隱几假寐了，</p>
<p>荒鷲在更高的天空下蛋。」</p>
<p>聽着這些，</p>
<p>像聽中古的神仙故事，</p>
<p>母親古老的心田抽出驚懼：</p>
<p>二十世紀聽說是文明世界，</p>
<p>是誰呀，在翻弄殘酷的老把戲？</p>
<p>然而母親畢竟暫時歡笑了，</p>
<p>因為荒寂的古津渡</p>
<p>有千里外的歸客繫泊。</p>
<p>風雪沈沈柴門暮。</p>
<h3>鐵流</h3>
<p>— 司徒宗</p>
<p>——紀念戰士周大根</p>
<p>隊長周大根臉紅紅的向着參謀：</p>
<p>「這不是兒戲，你得仔細考慮！」</p>
<p>話剛一出口，大根立刻覺得不大像樣；這不像自己說出來的！過去和惡勢力搏鬥的十年悠長的歲月裏，壓根兒就沒有說過軟弱的話！何况正當這個緊急的時候。對方兩道銳利的目光，正在緊迫着自己，一張長方臉上更透露着一絲淺笑！</p>
<p>「請不要誤會！」大根趕快在自已的說話上作一個更正：「這不是幹不幹的考慮，實在是方法上的仔細！」</p>
<p>眞的，幹，在大根早已認為不是問題！也許因為時時刻刻在準備着痛幹一塲，才會引起這决的事情！友軍的嫉妬，敵人的注意，也許就因為實際在幹的緣故。</p>
<p>大根一想起幹，全身就充滿了熱，鐵樣的臂勝裏，也似乎來了一股新力。但是，把僅有的一百多一些的同志分為兩路去應敵，這似乎值得考慮的問題。</p>
<p>「考慮……大根又這麼輕輕地拖出二個字；同時用苦痛的目覺對準參謀，似乎在期待參謀的諒解。</p>
<p>其實，在參謀决不會誤解的，心與心之間早巳有了鎖鏈一樣的聯繫，懷疑决不會在他們閒起一些作用！</p>
<p>「是吧？」參謀微笑着說了：「力量單薄？」</p>
<p>大根趕緊點着頭，心上似乎輕鬆了許多。</p>
<p>一但是，」參謀緊接着說下去：「敵人旣然分路來的，我們也就得令路迎敵，難道……」</p>
<p>「不，請不要說下去！」大根高聲吼呌了：「難道我們願意逃避和退却嗎！」</p>
<p>這是絕不會的，在大根，在參謀，在一百多個同志的心裹，從不會起個這樣一個念頭。這是用行動來更正民衆心理的時候了！讓民衆知道游擊區內雖然有着陰暗的一面，但同時却正在作光明的開展呢！</p>
<p>佈置就在極短的時間裹完成了。一百多個同志帶着興奮而又緊張的心情，同時在每一個的心頭，更充滿了憤怒。當他們冒着大雨在草叢中爬進時，要憤怒得使他們全身起了痙攣。這樣迂迥的小徑，敵人居然會道麼的熟悉！這還不是，這還不是……唉！</p>
<p>「漢奸！漢奸……」每一個人咬緊了牙齒。</p>
<p>一帶起伏不斷的墳地作了他們的堡壘；兩挺輕機關作為身子，同時興奮地大聲向着大家：</p>
<p>「準備！握緊你我們的槍！南面已經在接觸了！」</p>
<p>然而這裏東面却沒有動靜。十分鐘，二十分鐘，這實在眞是難熬的時問！聽着人家的槍聲在怒吼，這裹的同志都有些發癢。尤其是大根，更充滿了焦急。直到南面的槍聲慢慢兒沉默下去了，而這裹還沒有發現一些敵跡。</p>
<p>「這，這，莫非敵人集中一處，……那，也許要擋不，住了呢！……」</p>
<p>南面槍聲的停止，更帶給大根不安和憂慮。他再也不能他們東南二路的先鋒；大根和參謀就分任兩路的指揮。</p>
<p>雨早已濕透了他們單薄的衣服，風也吹得更緊了。大根匆匆地在巡視着每一個堡壘，忘記了髮頂的雨珠在向他臉部直淌。他走過每一個伏在墳後的同志前，總是蹲下去拍拍那個濕漉漉的肩膀：</p>
<p>一同志，莫放過這個機會呀！」</p>
<p>待仰起來的黑胖臉上露出一絲堅决的笑意時，他才放心地叉換了一個。……</p>
<p>突然，南面疏落的來了幾聲槍聲，但接着却一片緊密的機槍的咆哮。大根立刻伏下了伏着靜等了　他跳起身來，組聲的說：</p>
<p>「仔細着，我，去看看！」</p>
<p>他敏捷地向甫面抄去。穿過了樹林，走到了一條小河的岸邊；無意中，祗見許多鋼盔在對河的草叢中鑽動。</p>
<p>「啊——」</p>
<p>他驚呼了起來，怎麼後面也來了敵人。他趕緊揮起了臂膀，想向伏在墳後的同志招呼，預備隔着河給敵人一僩截擊</p>
<p>但是，「砰！」</p>
<p>一顆子彈正穿中了他的前胸。一陣疼痛，幾乎跌倒地上。他趕緊用手壓住了胸部，回身向樹林中在奔在喊，然而沒有奔上三步。第二顆子彈巳經着了他的腦壳。</p>
<p>正在這時，參謀也帶了他的部隊從南面來了，伏在墳後的同志也已跳起身來。</p>
<p>「向北退吧！」道是參謀的命令。</p>
<p>可是回答他的却是一片衝殺的吼聲；一支鐵流跳過了大根的屍身向小河邊衝去……</p>
<h3>再談「名」</h3>
<p>— 熾強</p>
<p>這回又來談一下「名」。</p>
<p>老生常談些吧：「名不正，則言不順；……。」</p>
<p>這該是東方型的常談，却不料希特拉也遠遠地對這常談打起招呼來，而且鞠躬盡瘁着。</p>
<p>併奧侵捷，甚至其餘，在這些不同的數字上，彷彿求得一個最大公的數的模樣，大言炎炎：</p>
<p>「民族一國家！」「少數民族問題！」</p>
<p>好一個赫然動聽的名詞！大概經過這樣「正名」之後幹起來，自然便利得多，舉世也祇得側目而視了。</p>
<p>手段儘管辣，賣相儘管咆哮，但是，究竟有點……道無疑地有點防恐「春秋直筆」之類。</p>
<p>「不免惱煞人也，如何是好？」</p>
<p>「有了！待俺擺起迷魂陣來，」於是：</p>
<p>「公民投票！」</p>
<p>挺，漂亮，冠冕堂皇！這「可使由之」的民衆，先抓到手來。</p>
<p>事後調查，這名詞除了在捷克蘇台德區問題發生時，用過一决外，南非委任統治的西南非也如法泡製起來。此後呢？往那裏去？</p>
<p>在名詞向來沒有國界的趨勢下，我這回特別有點感覺到這類名詞如果不幸而「東漸」之後的危機。</p>
<p>我們的國土上，會不會受到感冒而發燒起來呢？這完全要看潛藏在自身裹的「抗毒素」強不強來决定。</p>
<p>然而從「皇道」到了「樂土」（？）之後，一片「亞洲」「亞洲」之聲，更有什麼「新體系」，什麽「新秩序」，以及「和平」，「和」……之類，大名鼎鼎，花樣翻新，洋洋乎，盈耳哉，不其猗歟！</p>
<p>中國自古重「正名」，這件事，十萬分要緊，馬虎不得。一不留神，等到要想收拾起來，其難等於「下山撬石」，有力無處用。</p>
<p>失了幾個城池，不算希奇；就是焦土，也會茁壯新苗。惟獨人們——不逞之徒！　　名詞淆惑視聽的勾常，要給它分析個淸淸楚楚；那個葫蘆裹，究竟賣的是什麼藥。假借名義的宣傳，應該乾脆與以糾正或駁斥。</p>
<p>這不是腐儒式的「咬文嚼字」，乃是防微杜漸的第一把開山斧。凡是有識之士，都該來推敲，非爭取不行。「飲水思源」，「名！」「名！」「顧名」最要「思義」；尤其是當她正要「偃武修文」的時候。</p>
<p>這當口，也許「糖衣」是一層一層的！</p>
<h3>怎樣揀選題材</h3>
<p>— 子淸</p>
<p>一般說來我們喜歡寫寫文章的人們，每逢提起筆來的時候，總感覺得沒有故事寫，不知從何處下筆的好rqm句話說，也就是找不到着相當能寫的「題材」。</p>
<p>是的，一篇著作的有價值與吾，對於描寫的對象——題材——是有密切的關係的。它可以使人看了或描寫了後，有一種深刻的共嗚，好像所寫的故事，完全是讀者自身的故事那般親切，這種功能，就是靠「題材」的如何選擇了。那末，「怎樣揀選題村」這個問題，就應該而且必須要提在每個作者之前了。</p>
<p>一選擇題材」這個問題的提出，首先我認為要了解的，就是要知道時代與環境的變動性。比如在目前的抗戰時期，我們耍寫的題材，就不能脫離對「抗戰」有利益的各種生活描寫，否則就是把它登載出來，給讀者看起來，就等於一廢紙，使讀者不能深刻的意味到，甚至呌人討厭！假使描寫點對抗戰有關係的故事，如前綫軍人的生活，愛國靑年男女活躍於各地的救護與宣傳工作，或後方及淪陷區域的難民的遭遇，和敵人各種毒辣的殘殺掠奪的寫眞，這些生生的題材，我們只要好好的把它應用起來，就能使一般讀者得到「眞實感」，並深刻的同情和同鳴，甚至於振奮讀者，使之參加各項對「抗戰」有利的工作。所以說，一篇要使人深刻意味的著作，首先我們就要注意到它的題材是否合乎時代性。</p>
<p>其次我們要想到的，就是不忘記故事的「眞實性」。因為僅僅只在合乎時代這個抽象的意識下，假使不好好地來測量一下題材的眞實性與吾，這也不能增加著作品的價値。比如要描描寫難民所裹的難民，如果沒有體騐到難民生活的眞實性，僅僅從第三者或各方面得來的片段的消息，而自己提起筆來七拼我湊地寫成一篇，這簡直是笑話，對事實就沒有絲毫影響。所以說，要選擇題材，也不得不注意到它的眞實性。</p>
<p>最後，就要注意怎樣去組織這個題材。因為額觀的事實，反映到主觀的意識上來，還是一片片的零碎的故事，要把它聯成一個有系統的故事，這不得不去組織它們一下，使它合乎科學化，使讀者看了能得到深刻的印象，而又不多費時間。</p>
<p>敬愛的寫作者們，我提出這個問題，希望會成你們寫作時的參考。</p>

<p>每年元旦，在北平的各戲院中，都要來一齣吉祥新戲，如貴妃醉酒，滿床笏（即打金枝），御碑亭，鴻鸞禧等劇目。有的取其名字吉祥，有的取其結局美滿，綜言之，不過在一年之首，要使聽衆們得到一些彩頭之意。在北平的時候，每到元旦，梅蘭芳是愛唱醉酒，或是御碑亭，尚小雲愛貼滿床笏，而愛貼鴻鸞禧的，就共有三個名伶，一個是四大名旦中的荀慧生，一個是花旦魁首小翠花，還有一個就是票友下海的朱琴心了。他們三位的鴻鸞禧，我全都聽過，因為我對於這齣戲，異常愛好，所以全不止聽過一次。他們每人不同的藝術，姑且不必詳論，現在我先談談此戲的結構及其應有的表演神情吧！鴻鸞禧的故事是這樣的：秀才莫稽，家遭天火，流落於乞討。一天，天寒大雪，莫受了飢寒交迫，就倒在乞丐首領金松家門口，那時候金出外去了，他的女兒玉奴聽見門外有倒坍聲，就出門看見了莫稽，玉奴看他可憐，拿了些殘餘飯菜，給他吃了，又給了他一碗豆汁喝，總算救了他一命。等到金老回來，知他是個秀才，又看出玉奴愛慕他的神情，就將玉奴許配與他。結褵之後，兩小異常恩愛。但是玉奴志氣很大，不願常作乞討，遂勸莫去求取坊名，後來莫　帶金父女同上京城趕考，一路上莫是安心讀書，金老就四出乞討，請他道位姣婿果腹。榜發之後，莫居然中了，且得授縣令。金老父女，正在歡慰，不料莫竟變心，深恐有一乞丐妻子，受他人的恥笑。在上任途中，就用計將玉奴推下水去，同時並將金老趕走。玉奴落水以後，被一位考官林大人救活，收為義女。玉奴將前事說明，林大人全不直莫稽所為，答應替他報復，事有凑巧，莫稽就是這位林大人的鬥生，見面之後，林大人問他有無妻子，他為求與高鬥聯姻，所以將前事絕口不談。林大人就將女兒（其實就是玉奴）嫁與他，洞房花燭，喜氣洋洋，不料進房，始知就是前妻玉奴，不免羞愧，玉奴乃命奴僕拿棒打他一頓，由林大人的調和，算是和好如初，其時金老也找到任上，一家大小遂慶團圓了。由這齣戲的故事上看來，是專門描寫一種因好面子而演成負心的事實。結構方面，極為嚴緊。主角。當然是金玉奴。要演這個角色，是應該分開幾個時期，幾個態度的。</p>
<h3>信不信由你　胖女兒朱念珍今年纔我歲體重已一百五十磅　要是在好萊塢早聘去當演員了</h3>
<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>咱原住在虹鎭的，東洋人打了仗，就逃到這兒來啦！</p>
<p>沒有找到她的爸，在九江路一家水果店的樓上，那個胖胖的，矮矮的，女孩子很活潑的在一個陌生客人面前說話了</p>
<p>誰說她才八歲呢，瞧她的個子兒，一個十三四歲的男孩是一年級，級任先生姓嚴，我一到馬路上大家都要看我，眞討厭。」</p>
<p>穿着陰丹士林的罩衫，頸上圍了一根筆桿粗細的大銀圈，頭髮並沒有留起，但對分的桃子頭梳得很整潔，身材的莫三尺多高，腰圍很粗，她說：</p>
<p>「六歲起找突然發胖了，子才不過那麼模樣，更奇怪的是她的臉，要不是早有了是個女孩子的預覺，眞不會馬上容易猜測出她竟不是男孩。</p>
<p>見到我，一提起特意來看她，倒挑起了女孩子怕羞的本能向裹面逃去，可是，在聽到了來客是和善可親的談話之後，她才比較熟悉地出來說話了</p>
<p>「打仗前在華明小學念書，現在是四馬路上聯小學，我雖然從小就不瘦，現在一百五十磅，中國秤是一百〇五斤，可是飯倒也不過吃二大碗！」</p>
<p>在她的神情上看來是相當機警聰明，而且是絕不像八歲幼女的孱弱，她去拿照片，提起了筆寫自己的姓名，幾乎不曾和一個十三四歲的男孩子有點不同。</p>
<p>這孩子相當聰明，一見面就使人興起了睜星殷秀岑的感覺，因為她的面部以及頜下的肉太相像了，假使在好萊塢，這樣一個希罕的孩子一定又會被專恃搜集獵奇的經理人們重價聘去給影片公司作拍戲的材料了。</p>
<p>母親病了，父親在捕房裹上差，她要急急的進去服侍，她的鄰居告訴我，她是徐州人，父親朱熾卿，在中央捕房當探目，但是我覺得她的上海話和徐州話都還不錯。</p>

<p>菊朋又宸兩人，全是半路出家的譚派老生，當然腰腿上都沒有工夫。菊朋的毛病是「好挺小肚子」，又宸是「好傴僂着腰，高揚起屁股。」因此叔岩又打趣他們道：「最好呌又宸反串一回曹操，同菊朋合演「捉放，」兩人一同出塲，一前一後，走起台步來，倒很像個樣兒」。小余這張嘴，也着實把人挖苦得够瞧的啦；人說他沒有兒子，（只有二女）也是口德欠缺的緣故。</p>
<p>叔岩的　配陳氏，（德霖女）在四年前故去了，出殯的時候，才感覺棺前無子，連個穿孝袍子的都沒有，心中實在凄凉，長歡不己。他平日又生就個傲性子，不願收徒弟，楊寳忠雖是拜過他的，他都不肯承認這樁事，其餘那些冒牌的余派老生，也就更不必說了。誰知叔岩的夫人一死，倒替道般冒牌弟子造了機會，衆人旣瞧出叔岩的心思，遂部趕忙製辦孝衣，簡直就穿起徒兒的重孝及至發引的時辰一到，寳忠買森富英少樓少霖（又算內弟。又算徒兒）這般人好像奉了聖旨似的，很得意的排在棺材頭裹，　　比　前孝祖的更實授多了。這樣一來，叔岩再是嘴硬，却也不能抹煞事實所以後來他把世事也稍　看破，並且大開方便之門，於是女伶孟小冬也常往余家問教，現在李少春又正式拜了他，一向抱定不收內行徒弟的叔岩，現在也大變其主張了。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Generals in the Western Guangdong region have been holding military conferences for days, resolving to enhance defensive strength and maintain close communication with the Chinese troops in Northern Guangdong. The Southern Route boasts considerable strength and has now been divided into four defense zones, with high-ranking officials assigned to oversee military affairs.

<p>Sihui: Around 10:00 AM on the 5th, over 200 Japanese soldiers from Sanshui, aboard six motorboats, attempted to land at the old Sanshui Hialekong, covered by artillery fire from the Japanese forces in Mupin. The Chinese defenders calmly defended, waiting until the Japanese boats approached within one hundred meters before unleashing a dense barrage of machine-gun fire. Under the control of the fierce Chinese firepower, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and were unable to advance, being forced to retreat to Wankingsha in a very disorganized state. By dusk, they had fled back to the river mouth. The area around the old Sanshui Hialekong is now as peaceful as usual. (Dispatch from the 5th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Currently, the war in Guangdong Province is still focused on the two rivers in the northeast.

The Chinese troops in the East River area are continuing to besiege Shilong and Tungkun. The Japanese are currently transferring large reinforcements from Guangzhou in an attempt to defend Shilong, the only stronghold in the East River area, to the death.

<h3>Guerrilla Forces in Northern Hunan Attack Taolin in Rain and Snow; Chang Chih-chung Has Returned to Changsha; Deadline Set for Eliminating Banditry in Western Hunan</h3>
<p>Miluo: In Northern Hunan, yesterday was rainy and snowy, and the weather suddenly turned cold. A certain Chinese guerrilla force still took advantage of the darkness and attacked Taolin, east of Yueyang, in the rain and snow. They killed over twenty Japanese soldiers and seized over ten rifles and three horses. As of this morning, the snow has not stopped, and there are occasional hailstorms.

<h3>Street Fighting Breaks Out in Suiyuan City</h3>
<p>Wuyuan: A unit of 600 Chinese soldiers attacked Suiyuan City on the night of the 28th of last month, entering the main crossroad area of the old city center and engaging in fierce street fighting with the Japanese troops for four hours. A total of three hundred and thirty to forty Japanese and puppet soldiers were killed, and a large amount of Japanese ammunition and supplies were burned. By dawn, the Chinese army had safely withdrawn. Furthermore, a certain unit of the Chinese Self-Defense Army also once attacked Suiyuan City on the 31st, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers. In recent days, the Japanese and puppet troops in Suiyuan and Baotou have been extremely fearful. Reports claiming that a large number of Japanese troops from Baotou are reinforcing and planning to invade westward are completely untrue. (Dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<h3>Heavy Casualties Suffered by Japanese Troops on the Juwu Road</h3>

<p>One Week's Overview of the War Situation - Report by Chen Cheng -</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chen Cheng's report on the overview of the war situation in one week is as follows (from December 26th to January 1st):</p>
<p>Guangdong Area</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack in Guangdong, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army, the Japanese army planned to shorten the defense line and reorganized to wait for reinforcements. It also actively constructed fortifications in the areas of Tsangshing, Huangpu, Shunte, Jiujiang, Fatshan, and Sanshui on the outskirts of Guangzhou, as a plan for retreat and attack. In recent days, the Japanese troops in Tsangshing and Upper and Lower Lo Kong have been attacked by strike forces of a certain unit of the Chinese army, causing great panic. They fired artillery all night, consuming a large amount of ammunition. The Japanese troops in Shilong were attacked by a strike force of a certain unit of the Chinese army on the night of the 28th, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese troops for several hours, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. At dawn, the Chinese army safely withdrew to its original position. A unit of 1,000 Japanese troops from Fatshan was transferred away, and a regiment transferred back from Jiujiang filled the gap, seemingly as a change of defense and adjustment. The First Division of the Japanese army in Sanshui seems to be actively preparing, and it is rumored that there are follow-up troops in transit. It has a very active intention towards the West River. No active movements have been seen from the Japanese warships in the Beihai and Qiongyai waters.</p>
<p>Northern Section of the Yuehan Railway and Southern Jiangxi Area</p>
<p>The war on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway has been quite quiet in recent days. The Chinese and Japanese armies are still facing off on the line of the Sin Wang River and Kowloon Street. A certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Taolin in Linshong on the night of the 1st, killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese fled north in a disorganized manner. In the Southern Jiangxi area, the Japanese and Chinese armies are still facing off on the south bank of the Xiu River. Apart from small skirmishes between the guerrillas and the Japanese army from time to time, there have been no fierce battles on the front lines. At dawn on New Year's Day, the Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops at various key points between Yunghsiu and Tanan, killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in disarray, and the Chinese army is sending troops to pursue them.</p>
<p>Hubei-Henan Area</p>
<p>After being wiped out by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops in Yingshan, Taolin River, and Kwan Ho Pu in northern Hubei all retreated to Chit Ho. The Japanese troops at Kuantimiao also retreated to Yingshan. After a certain team of the Chinese army attacked Anlu, they captured Ching Lung Tam. The Japanese troops retreated towards Yen Tun Tien. The Japanese troops in Cho Shi, numbering two thousand, are on high alert and in a state of extreme fear. In Southern Henan, there has been no fighting recently. However, the Japanese troops in eastern Henan have been quite active recently. The Japanese army near Shangchiu and Kaifeng has recently increased to five to six thousand. A unit of several hundred soldiers invaded Chi County and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese garrison. Although Tung Shu has been occupied by the Japanese, it does not dare to invade westward due to the containment by the Chinese guerrillas. In Northern Henan, the headquarters of the Japanese army in Sinhsiang was attacked by Chinese plainclothes teams and caught fire, burning for days. The Luli Wang Fu Railway Station north of Sinhsiang was attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese could not resist and collapsed northward.</p>
<p>Shanxi-Suiyuan Area</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Shanxi has recently planned to actively besiege the Chinese army in western Shanxi in preparation for crossing the river and invading westward. Since the beginning of the second ten days of December, they have invaded in multiple directions. One route of the Japanese army invading north from Hotchin was severely attacked by the Chinese army near Yumen Mountain and has already fled back towards Hotchin. One route of the Japanese army invading west from Linfen joined forces with the Japanese army invading south from Fenyang on the 29th and fled to Ta Ning. A unit harassed Chi County and Hsiang Ning and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. One route of the Japanese army invading south from Fenyang via Chiu Yu was intercepted by the Chinese army and was unable to succeed. One route of the Japanese army invading west from Lishi was ambushed by the Chinese army near Liu Chuang, and a unit has already fled east. Other units are still planning to invade westward. The Chinese army is dividing its forces to drive them out. In general, the area between Chi County and Hsiang Ning is the predetermined battlefield for the Chinese army and has been carefully arranged. It is expected that the Japanese army in that area will soon suffer a major blow. The Japanese army in the Suiyuan and Baotou areas has continued to increase, seemingly with the intention of invading westward. Fearing guerrilla attacks, they have recently demolished all the civilian houses within thirty miles around Baotou City. Homeless refugees have flocked to join the guerrillas, posing a major threat to the Japanese army. At the same time, the puppet troops in the area are fighting among themselves. The more powerful units are brewing mutiny.</p>
<p>The report that the Japanese army in Baotou is reinforcing to a large extent and will launch a westward invasion is completely untrue.</p>
<p>Hebei Area</p>
<p>There are many Japanese troops stationed at key points on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway. There are over 10,000 Japanese troops near Shihchiachuang. A unit of over 7,000 has gradually moved westward, seemingly to reinforce Shanxi.</p>
<p>In summary, there have been no particularly major battles on any front this week. In Southern China, the Japanese army in Guangdong seems to be holding fast to key points near Guangzhou and strongholds such as Humen and Tungkun. The main force invaded Chaoching from Sanshui, but the Chinese army launched simultaneous attacks on all fronts, preventing the Japanese army from taking care of both ends and suffering heavy losses, forcing them to retreat to their original positions. In Central China, there have only been small skirmishes. The Japanese army seems to be concentrating its forces in Wuhan for reorganization, and the Chinese army is waiting for an opportunity to attack. In Northern China, the Japanese army in Shanxi and Suiyuan has been very restless and has invaded various areas in western Shanxi in multiple directions. However, they have suffered heavy losses after being severely attacked by the Chinese army and are still fighting in Hotchin, Chia An, and Lishi. The Chinese army's defenses are tight and its forces are strong. The Japanese want to break through and cross the river to invade westward, but the Chinese are determined to inflict heavy losses on them. Now, the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun. The Japanese army has penetrated deep into the mountains, which is actually beneficial to China. In terms of political and military strategy, the Japanese have become exhausted and stretched thin. The Chinese should take advantage of new strategies and tactics to achieve a comprehensive strike against the Japanese, forcing them to lose their footing and breaking them individually and collapsing them entirely, in order to achieve final victory.

<h3>Report that Wang Ching-wei is Hiding in Hong Kong; Another Report Says He is Under Surveillance in Hanoi; Chen Yu-jen Will Make a Formal Statement</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) It has now been learned that Ching-wei is hiding in Hong Kong. Someone saw him at a certain Japanese person's residence on Conaught Road, rumored to be sending out a radiant telegram. This is the result of Chen Pi-chun's insistence. Ko Mou is acting on his behalf to liaise with the Japanese side and is working hard to facilitate this. (Special dispatch from 1:00 AM on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) There is a rumor that Chen Yu-jen will resume his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Chen said that it is difficult to comment on the radiant telegram for the time being and that he may make a formal statement in the future. As for his views on the current situation, he will submit a telegram to the Central Government for revision before issuing it. (Special dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: The story that Wang Ching-wei, former Vice-President of the Kuomintang, flew from Hanoi to Hong Kong yesterday has been denied by French officials here. Wang lives alone in the suburbs of Hanoi. The French authorities are keeping the location a secret. After arriving in Hanoi from Kunming on December 21st, he immediately entered the hospital. Later, at the request of the local French authorities, he was discharged from the hospital and moved to a villa in the suburbs, where he is guarded by guards and close confidants, and refuses to meet any guests. (Fast News Agency dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: According to French sources, Wang Ching-wei is still residing somewhere here and has not gone elsewhere. The rumor that he flew to Hong Kong the day before yesterday has now been denied by the French authorities. Wang is in fact still hiding somewhere near Hanoi, but only French people know the location. The staff of the Chinese Consulate General in Hanoi have stated that after Wang sent out the peace-seeking telegram and was expelled from the party by the Central Government, they have severed all relations with Wang and are closely monitoring Wang and his associates' actions. It is also reported that they have received orders from the Central Government in Chongqing to keep Wang under surveillance. (Fast News Agency dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>Hanoi, according to this place "Future Report" published, Wang Ching-wei's coming to Hanoi, was on December 21, directly from Kunming. After arriving in Hanoi, at 1 p.m. that afternoon, he entered a certain hospital to live. However, the highest authority in Annam came out to interfere, and advised and made him leave the hospital to move elsewhere. Wang then hid in a certain Chinese friend's place in Hanoi, and has been staying there since then. Wang Ching-wei's residence is now surrounded by Jing Wei, in addition to his close friends, no visitors are received. It is rumored that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chung-hui had come to Hanoi to persuade Wang to rein in at the precipice, but Wang also refused to meet him. Wang himself is invisible, but reporters have met several of his confidants. According to them, Wang's exodus is not just a personal act, but is accompanied by several friends, of which there are six who are the most noted. In addition, it is also said that Chen Lifu came to Hanoi, which is difficult to verify. According to Chen, who is one of the leaders of the right wing of the Kuomintang, his coming to Hanoi is actually to persuade Wang to repent, or to express sympathy to Wang, which is also impossible to explore. (Fast News Agency dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Reuters reporter learned today that Guo Taiqi is an old friend of Wang Ching-wei, so he sent a telegram to Wang, pointing out that the peace proposals made by the CCP were wrong and strongly urging him to retract them. According to usually well-informed sources, Wang is currently residing somewhere about sixty miles from Hanoi. Li Tsung-jen, Liu Wen-hui, and public organizations in Yunnan and Hunan have issued declarations, severely criticizing Wang. According to sources in Hong Kong's Chinese community, Hong Kong newspaper vendors are refraining from selling the South China Daily because it is run by Wang Ching-wei. (Reuters dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Hong Kong English South China Morning Post published an article on the 4th entitled "Wang Ching-wei's Failure", refuting Wang's fallacies in detail. It recognized that Wang's proposition cannot prevent China from losing territory and sovereignty. Wang's views have never been firm and consistent. This time he has been severely criticized, which shows that the people have lost faith in Wang. In the end, it said that this move is actually to encourage traitors to sell out the motherland and promote international distrust of China. Fortunately, he has been abandoned by the whole country, and the international community has also judged his failure. (Dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Concentrated in Northern Honan; West Section of the Taoching Railway</h3>
<p>Loyang: There are less than 20,000 Japanese troops in Northern Honan, mostly the troops from the Iseki unit of the 14th Division, concentrated in the areas of Huojia, Poai, and Fenyang in the western section of the Taoching Railway, attempting to threaten Chengchow, Hahn County, and Loyang. The Japanese troops along the Chin Han Railway north of Hsi Yu and the western section of the Taoching Railway are taking a conservative policy towards the military situation in Northern Honan. Therefore, strong fortresses have been built in various strongholds to defend against attacks by the Chinese army. Several teams composed of infantry, cavalry, and artillery have been formed to conduct guerrilla warfare. It is expected that the Japanese army will be unable to invade westward at this time.

<h3>Wang Tsan-hsu Flew to Chungking Today to Report and Request Instructions</h3>
<p>(Chengtu) Wang Tsan-hsu is scheduled to fly to Chungking on the afternoon of the 6th. On the 5th, he told a Central News Agency reporter that he was going to Chungking to report and request instructions. In the future, the Sichuan political facilities would be managed in accordance with the orders and instructions of the Central Government. Outside of the central government's political orders, he personally had no political views. Outside of the central government's laws and regulations, he personally had no guidelines. He said he had limited talent and strength, and that Sichuan's responsibility was extremely important. Whether Sichuan could be managed well depended on the degree to which the central government's laws and regulations were followed. Therefore, he said he was going to Chongqing to visit the highest leader and relevant officials, one to report on the current situation in Sichuan, and the other to request instructions on the future policy of governing Sichuan. He added that the request for instructions was more important than the report, because political facilities were complex, and how to make Sichuan bear the heavy responsibility of the War of Resistance depended on the leader's detailed instructions. He said that he would only follow the instructions and do them faithfully, and had nothing else to say. (Dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Southern Shansi Failed to Invade Westward</h3>
<p>Hsingchi: Last month, the Japanese troops on the Tungpu Railway crossed the Fen River and invaded westward. Because the Chinese army ambushed them on both sides of the railway, the Japanese troops changed to defensive and waited for reinforcements to raise the issue. By the end of the month, the heavy snow in western Shansi had just stopped, and the Japanese troops were gradually assembled, 6,000 to 7,000 in Fenyang, 3,000 in Hungtung Chaoching, 6,000 in Linfen, and over 2,000 in Chu Hou Hsinchiang. They launched a large-scale westward invasion on the 25th. The first route was based on Fenyang, passing through Tui Jiu Yu and going north to Mai Chiao and Shi Kou, and then north to Shihlou and south to Sshih County. Japanese troops have been found west of Xin Guan, crossing the Yangtze River. The second route was based on Linfen, passed through Tung Hsi Lu Chu, Sun Chu, Sshih Men, and Hei Lung Kwan, and attacked Pu County, Ta Ning, Nien Kou, Hung Liang Kou, and Nan Wan Li. There were fierce battles. The third route started with the Xiangling, advanced westward to Yu Kuo, occupied the Kuo Chia Zhuang, and then went north to the Chinese army's attack. After being welcomed by the Chinese army, they fled to the north and launched a bloody battle west of Chen Tou and south of Yao Yeh. The Japanese army joined the Japanese army at the junction of Chin Yu Ling and Hei Lung Kwan. In this battle, the Chinese army Wei Ming-hsiao, the head of the High Ling Han Ying battalion, was killed, and Chao Te-kui, the deputy head of the regiment, was wounded. The fourth route of Chu Wo Hsinchiang Japanese army occupied Chin Zhang San Chuan Chao Kang and other places. A certain regiment of the Chinese army went south from Yu Kou and a certain division went north from Chi Wang Mountain, attacking from the north and south, and the Japanese army hesitated to advance. The Chinese army, Yuan San-tao Ying battalion commander, was killed. The fifth route was based on Hotchin, passing through Fan Tsu, Ku Chen, Hsi Wei Kou, Hsi Po Chen, and Mao Tzu Ching, and advanced north. The main force attacked Yumen in the west. Subsequently, the Chinese army recovered Yumen, and the Japanese army stole to Shih Chia Tan, and took Nanny Miao in the east, harassing the villagers' County Kilns. They split the army from the Kiln and attacked the Chinese army at the Small Boat Den crossing. It was found that the Japanese army was determined to invade west, headed by the 118th Division, Taniguchi Motoro's department. This division was mostly composed of elderly and weak people, and suffered the greatest losses at Hengling Pass and Heng Shui in Chiang County, Southern Shansi. The entire 115th Regiment was annihilated by the Chinese army's Peng Division in Wang Tsai Chen. In total, the entire division lost more than two-thirds. The former division commander Shimo Ryotaro and brigade commander Nakano were dismissed due to the defeat in the Hoshii Park battle. In this resolution battle, in addition to the new recruits, more puppet troops of Wang Ying and Zhang Renjie were also equipped. They captured Heilungguan and the Zhuang in the villages of Ta Ning and Chuan in northwest of the township. The Japanese army's rear was cut off, and the two sides were often hit. After being defeated at Small Boat Den, he attempted to find another crossing point at Ping Tu Guan or Xin Guan Kou, but was also afraid that he would not be able to do so.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in the Sino-Japanese Problem</h3>
<p>Yesterday, airplanes suddenly appeared over the Shanghai International Settlement, scattering leaflets. It is said that the leaflets were written in obscure Chinese, mainly claiming that some Chinese ambassadors abroad had telegraphed the National Government, hoping to cede the Northeast to Japan as a condition for peace. The leaflet stated that this was due to the fear of mutual destruction, which would only benefit Soviet Russia. Ambassadors stationed abroad are responsible for implementing national policies and negotiating diplomatically, and it is not their place to overstep their authority and discuss national policies. Since the unification of China, both the provincial officials within the country and the diplomatic personnel abroad have been able to abide by their duties, and there have been no more instances of jointly telegraphing opinions on national affairs. Therefore, the claims in the leaflets are fundamentally untrue. Furthermore, judging from the tone of the leaflets regarding war and peace and the writing style, it is safe to say that the leaflets must have been written by the Japanese. At that time, the people who picked up scraps of paper happily ran around telling each other, "Japan is so clever!" We don't need to analyze the Japanese mentality based on the leaflets, nor do we need to take the leaflets as strong evidence that "Japan is so clever." However, what we must know is that in the past two weeks, the Sino-Japanese problem has been entering a new phase, and people in China and abroad should pay attention to its evolution. For example, on December 22, former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe issued a statement. It not only made it clear that Japan would not give up its ambition to dominate East Asia and destroy China, but also used diplomatic rhetoric to lure various countries in the hope of trapping them in their schemes. On December 26, Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek expressed his determination to resist aggression, defend the country, and strive for national independence and freedom. Governments and people in Europe and the United States unanimously condemned Japan and praised China for these declarations from China and Japan. On December 31, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan even responded to Konoe with a protest. On the 4th of this month, the Konoe cabinet collapsed, and the ultra-right-wing Hiranuma organized a new cabinet. On the same day, U.S. President Roosevelt fiercely criticized aggressor nations in Congress and planned punitive measures; Britain, France, and other countries readily agreed. All these important developments will have a significant impact on the future of the Sino-Japanese problem. However, the pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei's advocacy of surrender and yesterday's leaflets encouraging peace talks are guerrilla tactics employed by the Japanese side in the late stage of its aggression against China and amidst the dynamic international situation.</p>
<p>Using Wang Jingwei as a guerrilla tactic earned Japan the criticism of the world as a "damp firecracker." Using leaflets as a guerrilla tactic earned Japan the citizen's exclamation "Japan is so clever!" It is predicted that after these two events, there will probably be other measures to use the idea of peace talks to shake China's determination to resist and to ease the international community's righteous words. Japan's military operations in China and its international diplomacy are on the verge of collapse, which is an obvious fact. The unsustainability of its domestic finances can be proven by the blatant implementation of the National Mobilization Law. It is important to know that the content of the Mobilization Law enacted by Japan after the outbreak of the war of aggression against China will make the property rights of capitalists and the human rights of the people almost completely equal to zero. The full implementation of the Mobilization Law is virtually no different from a revolutionary action by its warlords against capitalists and the people. Konoe was not strong enough to overcome this, so he started with the ultra-right-wing Hiranuma to preside over national affairs, control the Mobilization Law, cut flesh to mend sores, and wielded the knife to cut. If Japan's finances had not fallen into a desperate situation, it would never have implemented this extraordinary decree. Only when its military, diplomacy, and finances were all in dire straits did it resort to all kinds of desperate measures to escape death. When its tricks were exhausted, Wang Jingwei and the leaflets appeared one after another.</p>
<p>From July 7, 1937, to this day, it has been exactly eighteen months. The casualties and sacrifices of the Chinese military and civilians during the war of resistance can be said to be unprecedented in history. Who doesn't have a family? Who doesn't have a livelihood? Who isn't heartbroken? Who enjoys the sound of gunfire? Therefore, at this time of thousands of difficulties, a word about ending the war and a thought about peace and welfare are most likely to make people's hearts flutter. However, with Konoe's statement, Wang Jingwei's telegram, and the airplane leaflets coming one after another, the Chinese government and people have been able to avoid being tempted by them. Japan's plan to destroy the country and people is completely exposed. Even if they use the bait of peace and welfare, who would covet it? Even if they set up a trap of peace and welfare, who would fall into it? The Chinese side only takes Japan's cessation of aggression and withdrawal of its troops eastward as a prerequisite for ending the war, and is so loyal and forgiving as to be unable to yield any further. The sorrow of serious sacrifices and the determination to defend the country and survive cannot be taken away. What's more, there is Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who is in charge of military and political affairs, who recently instructed the military and civilians on the way to fight and the reasons for victory. Below, there are generals and soldiers who have experienced hundreds of battles and have the spirit to swallow the enemy, who are unyielding and make persistent efforts. Internally, there are people who share the same hatred for the enemy, sacrificing their current lives and property for the sake of future generations. Externally, there are friendly countries that provide assistance with weapons and funds, and have consistently sympathized with China and are close to gradually strengthening their sanctions against aggression. Comparing this with those whose military, diplomacy, finance, and economy are all in dire straits, who cannot continue to endure the pain for some time until the end of victory, and who would be willing to give up at the last minute, compromise and surrender, and move towards eternal destruction?</p>
<h3>The Crux of the Dispute Between Kang and Tibet: The Da Jin Temple Case Resolved; Representatives of Both Sides Sign in Dege; The Spirit of the Resolution Lies in Mutual Concessions</h3>
<p>Kangding. The Da Jin Temple case, the crux of the decades-long dispute between Kangding and Tibet, has been satisfactorily resolved after seven years of negotiations. Representatives of both sides signed an agreement in Dege County on the 2nd. The representatives of the Xikang Provincial Government were Zhang Zhenzhong and Fan Changyuan, and the representatives of the Tibetan side were Wang Qingdai Ben Wang Tingqian. The content consists of eight articles and one appendix. The spirit of the resolution fully expresses mutual concessions. The main points are: The amount that Da Jin Temple should compensate to Han merchants, the insufficient amount, shall be supplemented by both Kangding and Tibet. The total amount of this compensation is 128,000 Tibetan yuan, equivalent to 64,000 legal currency. Da Jin Temple should compensate 32,000 Tibetan yuan for the reconstruction of the Dengke County Government. The insufficient amount shall also be supplemented by both Kangding and Tibet. The Da Jin Temple shall be repaired by 150 workers sent by the Garze County Government. The firearms previously supplied to the Da Jin Temple lamas by the Tibetan side shall be completely recovered. Only 30 guns shall be allowed to remain in the temple for self-defense, and shall be kept in the county government for safekeeping during peacetime. (4th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yoshiko Kawashima: Suffered Ax Wounds; The Deceased Was Her Younger Sister</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) It was previously reported that Yoshiko Kawashima was assassinated and died. It is now known that Yoshiko Kawashima was indeed ambushed in Tianjin on New Year's Eve and suffered several ax wounds, and her condition is critical. The person assassinated at the same time as Kawashima was her younger sister, who died from gunshot wounds. The assassin did not recognize Kawashima, so he focused on the one dressed as a woman, her sister, who died at the time. Although it is rumored that Kawashima escaped, she was actually wounded by an axe. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's "Nichinichi Shimbun" reported that, according to a previous report from the Chinese side, Yoshiko Kawashima was assassinated in Tianjin. This news is not true.

Mrs. Wang was killed with an axe on Saturday. (5th dispatch, United Press)</p>
<h3>The Puppet Organization in Ping Attempting to Undermine the Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(Peiping) The "Provisional Government" Ministry of Finance here recently announced that, starting from February 20, when the legal tender still circulating in North China is exchanged for the currency of the United Reserve Bank, a further discount of 30% will be applied. At this point, the legal tender has been devalued by a total of 40%. The effect of this new order is uncertain, because although a devaluation of 10% was officially announced last summer, those with legal tender amounting to 2,000 yuan still received a premium of 4%.

<h3>British Worries Growing as Trade in China is Deprived; Commercial Advisor Responds to Mr. Nie's Remarks; Hoping the Government Will Give China Greater Assistance</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday, both The Times and The Daily Telegraph published articles that further prove that British merchants are increasingly worried about the Japanese infringement of foreign trade and rights in China. Mr. Lee, Chairman of the Cotton Cloth Dyeing Association and a member of the Commercial Advisor Committee, published a letter in The Times yesterday, strongly supporting the remarks made by Mr. Nie Gerson, Director of the China Group of the London Chamber of Commerce, in The Times on December 21 last year. Mr. Nie's article stated, "The public's attention to British interests in China is far greater than what it currently receives." It also stated, "Those engaged in trade with China all believe that the ultimate goal of the Japanese is to eliminate all Western forces and enterprises in the Far East," and condemned the British government's long-term policy of tolerance in China, saying that Britain actually allowed its largest market to be gradually eliminated by Japan to become a Japanese-dominated trade area, which is astonishing. If the British government does not act to strengthen this policy beyond mere diplomatic protests that encourage the Japanese to despise it and invite ridicule from continental countries, it is tantamount to telling British merchants that destruction is inevitable because Britain's prestige has gradually declined. Mr. Lee solemnly announced that the total amount of British investment in China is 300 million pounds, and compared the decline in British and American exports to China in 1938 with the increase in Japanese exports, and also pointed out the situation in Taiwan, Korea, and "Manchukuo," saying that since the Japanese occupied "Manchukuo," British trade there has accounted for only 1% of its total. If Japanese aggression is not curbed, this situation will also occur in China. We can only pay for the huge burden of reorganizing armaments and social services if we can increase, or at least maintain, our export trade. As for China, it has vast possibilities, great trade talents, and a desire for peace, and we should give it greater assistance than it currently receives." Mr. Gilling also published an article in The Daily Telegraph, analyzing in detail the resources of the Sino-Japanese-"Manchurian" economic alliance, warning people not to lightly speculate on the collapse of Japanese finances and economy, and solemnly declaring that among the countries in the world in which Britain has invested money, China ranks as the largest, except for Argentina. Therefore, if Japan can overcome its current financial difficulties and establish a Far East economic alliance, the one that will bear the brunt and sacrifice the most will be Britain. (5th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News published a lengthy article today, anonymously authored, stating that the news that the Japanese government is moving further along the path of fascism is not a good sign for the future of British commercial interests in China. The article detailed the losses suffered by British trade in the Far East since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, saying that from this situation and the generally unsatisfactory attitude of the Japanese military authorities, it is clear that Japan will never be satisfied until it has completely monopolized Chinese trade and resources, eliminated all other interests, and forever destroyed the Open Door Policy. If Japan wins, it will inevitably establish an effective puppet government in the manner of the three northeastern provinces. At that time, what can be hoped for is that this new government will evolve into a "Manchukuo" II. For the sake of British interests, Britain must prevent this outcome at any cost. If Britain waits until Japan has completely reached a deadly position, a major Anglo-Japanese conflict will be inevitable. Giving China economic assistance by relaxing credit to China can ultimately be as effective as directly declaring war on Japan, and the cost is far less than directly declaring war on Japan. If things are still worth doing, the British government may prohibit the export of large quantities of war materials and other necessary supplies currently being shipped to Japan, and prohibit the import of various items from Japan.

<h3>Polish Foreign Minister Visits Hitler to Discuss Eastern European Issues</h3>
<p>Berchtesgaden. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck arrived here this morning from Nice, France, and immediately paid a visit to Führer Hitler to hold talks. (5th dispatch, Havas)</p>
<p>Warsaw. Polish Foreign Minister Beck has traveled from southern France to Munich, Germany, to hold talks with Führer Hitler. Given the current situation in Europe, its political importance cannot be ignored. The issues that should be discussed by both parties must include the issue of the Free City of Danzig. It is heard that the German side will request Poland to allow it to build a highway through the Polish Corridor to connect the German province of Pomerania with East Prussia. Although the Polish newspapers have not mentioned this, the Polish government may not explicitly oppose it. The issues of German minorities and Ukrainians will also be discussed. It is heard that Foreign Minister Beck will inquire with Führer Hitler to find out his true intentions and assess the situation, and propose guarantees to Führer Hitler, or request guarantees from him. How the relations between Germany and Poland will evolve in the future will depend on the outcome of this conversation. The general international situation will also be discussed by both parties.

<h3>British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Return to Capital Early to Prepare Fully Before Visiting Rome</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax suddenly returned to London yesterday, which was quite unexpected. The two were originally scheduled to return to the capital at the end of the year. However, political observers believe that the sudden return of the two prime ministers to London is of great importance, and believe that this trip was agreed upon by the two prime ministers. Chamberlain recently told reporters that he would have ample opportunity to exchange views with Halifax before going to Rome. Therefore, political figures believe that the early return of the two prime ministers to the capital is to discuss the attitude of the United States towards the issues of Spain and the Mediterranean, in preparation for the Rome talks.

<h3>Britain Actively Implements Warship Construction Program</h3>
<p>(London) The London "Evening Standard" reported that the British Navy will increase the construction of 100 ships of various types in 1939, including multiple 10,000-ton cruisers. On the other hand, some of the large ships already under construction will not be completed until next year. In addition to the construction of 35,000-ton battleships, the following ships are also under construction: five aircraft carriers, two of which can be completed this year; twenty-two cruisers, including three of 10,000 tons, which can be put into service this year; twenty-three destroyers, of which thirty will also be completed this year; and fifteen submarines, of which thirteen will be completed soon. Other ships, such as three auxiliary ships, four minesweepers, three gasoline tankers, one submarine supply ship, two river gunboats, and thirty-four small ships, will all be put into naval service this year. However, seven new cruisers will not be completed until 1940. The report went on to say that of the five 35,000-ton battleships currently under construction, two will be built next year, and the remaining three will be completed in 1941. Two more battleships have been approved for construction but have not yet started construction. It is said that the displacement will be 40,000 tons. The newspaper estimates that there are currently 150 British naval ships under construction. (5th dispatch, Haitong)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Message to Congress Criticizes Dictatorial Countries; The United States is Determined to Uphold Democracy and International Integrity and is Willing to Consult with Other Countries to Prevent Aggression; Advocates for Amending the Current Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt personally read his message to Congress today, which lasted forty minutes before finishing, interrupted by applause. The applause was especially loud when he advocated amending the current neutrality law and the federal government's continued expenditure of huge sums of money. When he spoke about upholding the democratic system, the entire audience applauded unanimously. When the speech ended, the people in the audience shouted their approval. Almost the entire diplomatic corps was present to listen, including the German chargé d'affaires, Thompson. When President Roosevelt criticized the dictatorship and declared his unwavering adherence to democratic principles, Thompson remained expressionless. (4th dispatch, Havas)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently delivered a message to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives at one o'clock this afternoon, stating: "Peace has not yet been established. Military or economic wars are now taking place around the United States, threatening the three things that Americans do not lack: first, religion; second, democratic system; and third, international integrity. The latter two are derived from religion. All three are mutually reinforcing and indispensable, and should be jointly maintained. "Any social order that refuses to accept these three things cannot accept the Christian ideal. This kind of social order should be rejected by the United States, and it should maintain its inherent faith. There are now people advocating a new philosophy that only respects power. If this philosophy controls other continents and invades the American continent, we Americans will know what kind of situation we will suffer. Therefore, the enemies of our faith and humanitarian values should not be allowed to surround our country. This is no different from other countries not wanting to be surrounded by their enemies." It is gratifying that the American republics have the same ideals and can live in peace and respect each other. This peace and this ideal should be maintained first.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the American countries are confronting other countries in the world. On the contrary, we should still maintain our traditional proposition and be willing to discuss with other countries ways to prevent aggression and arms competition, as well as ways to revive international commerce. Today, the world is extremely small, and various offensive weapons are extremely fast. If one nation or one country refuses to resolve various disputes through negotiation, other countries cannot guarantee peace. Furthermore, if a government possesses huge armaments and only promotes a policy of power, other countries, in order to protect their security, have no other way to follow except to maintain defensive armaments. In addition, new-style warfare is faster and broader in scope than in the past, so we should make preparations for defense in advance. Before launching military operations, each aggressor country uses preliminary aggression, or conducts propaganda, or uses money to bribe, or destroys the connections of good people, or incites various prejudices, or encourages infighting, in various forms.</p>
<p>In each democratic country, those who believe in God, abide by various treaties, and treat other countries with sincerity should not turn a blind eye to violations of justice, no matter where they occur. When a sister country is invaded and affects us, it is not appropriate to stand idly by without effectively protesting... Although we avoid using force to stop aggression, we do not act as if aggression did not happen. There are other ways to put pressure on aggressor countries besides war. At a minimum, any action, even passive inaction, that helps aggressor countries or strengthens their power should be avoided like filth. The implementation of the current neutrality law may be unequal, unfair, and even favor aggressor countries and be thin to countries that are aggressed upon. This kind of situation, considering the human instinct for survival, should not be allowed to remain unchanged for a long time. Then, President Roosevelt defined the general national defense policy, saying, "We must first maintain sufficient military power so that once an enemy suddenly attacks various strategic locations, we can repel them and maintain the strength to resist until the final victory. In addition, defense equipment must also be strengthened to meet all needs and not be broken by the enemy.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of armaments, a message will be submitted to Congress within the day. It is hoped that the people of the country will unite to strengthen national defense. The second part of the message was used to discuss domestic issues, stating that the current government has formulated a comprehensive plan to preserve national resources, relieve the poor, resolve labor-capital disputes, enrich the credit system, and encourage various research projects. All of these have been achieved without resorting to dictatorial powers, such as forced labor, restrictions on funds, the establishment of concentration camps, hindering freedom of speech, and violating various rights stipulated in the Declaration of Human Rights. All of these means have not been adopted. Although, there is a need to reorganize the administrative structure, and the Social Security Act and the Law on Adjusting the Mutual Relations between Labor and Capital need to be improved so that both capital and labor can be closer to each other. Although the dictatorial countries have solved the problems of unemployment and the use of idle funds, they use force to solve them. The United States should adopt other methods that do not violate current principles and the Declaration of Human Rights to compete.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt then described the achievements of recent years, and said that the unity of the American people and the sense of responsibility have improved compared to 1929 or 1932. The policy of spending huge sums of money by the federal government is also fully justified. The total amount of public and private debts in the United States has not increased from 1929 to today, and interest rates have been reduced. The pain felt by the people is that capital has not been fully utilized and should be remedied. The total annual income of the people should now be increased to US$80,000,000,000. If so, "the number of unemployed can be reduced, and the various revenues and expenditures of the federal government can be offset." It is very dangerous for the government to suddenly save various expenditures. On the contrary, if the policy of spending huge sums of money is fully maintained, the total annual income of the people will not be difficult to recover to US$80,000,000,000, the original number.</p>
<p>The answer is that the price required by the dictatorship is too great and is by no means what the American people are willing to pay. Not only the spiritual values, such as the sacred freedom of speech and freedom of belief, have ceased to exist, but all our funds will also be confiscated, and our children will not be able to receive education as free and self-respecting human beings, but will become tools thrown by machines. In short, in order to maintain the freedom to survive, it is worth sacrificing and we do not need to resort to dictatorship. (5th dispatch, Havas)</p>
<h3>Biddulph Addresses Public, Endorses President's Policy, Two Paths to Deal with Defaulting Nations, Believes Economic Sanctions Necessary</h3>
<p>(Washington) Following President Roosevelt's address to Congress today, Senator Biddulph, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement, saying that the policy of resisting aggressor nations advocated by the President should be supported by Congress. "We now have two paths to follow. One is that for any government that has signed a peace treaty with our country, if there is any infringement of the rights of our government and citizens, we will only lodge protests to resolve the matter. The second is that in addition to lodging protests, we will impose spiritual, commercial, and financial sanctions to make these protests more effective. The issue lies in choosing one of these two paths. I believe that our government has already chosen the second path. Furthermore, since the implementation of the current Neutrality Act, the results it has caused are actually contrary to what was expected, which is a real situation." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is believed here today that President Roosevelt's address to Congress is a return to the tough stance of 1937. Congressional sources pointed out that the President made a bold and indignant attack on dictators, and openly stated that he would retaliate economically against general aggressor nations. The President also asked Congress to amend the current Neutrality Act so as to at least in all aspects, end the possibility of the United States legally providing convenience to aggressor nations. What deserves our attention most is that President Roosevelt's address to Congress was not only directed to Congress as a whole, but to the entire country and the world. Therefore, immediately after the President read it to Congress, it was broadcast to the whole world in four languages: French, Italian, German, and Spanish. Authorities believe that the President's address is the foundation of the national defense plan. From the President's intention, he not only wants to protect the rights of the United States in the Western Hemisphere, but also cares about aggression events all over the world. Therefore, based on this point, and viewing the President's opposition to authoritarian countries, the United States may attempt to impose economic sanctions on Japan in the Far East, although Japan's aggression is currently not related to foreign aggression in the Western Hemisphere. Government leaders are awaiting public reaction to the President's address tonight, and anticipate that the support gained for the President's firm stance will be even stronger than the Chicago speech in 1937. According to the results of the United States' experience in Asia and South Africa in the past 18 months, a sharp change has taken place in general public opinion in the United States. As for the actual methods of how to sanction aggressor nations, officials are unwilling to disclose them, and a major plan has not yet been determined. However, it is said that the President and his aides have completed research on various methods within the scope of current laws, and they can be put into practice as soon as an order is issued. At the same time, in order to increase the effectiveness of this method, the President advocates major revisions to the main points of the Neutrality Act. The President strongly opposes the policy of isolationists, claiming that "America will never allow beliefs that are hostile to us to surround us." (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>England and France Welcome, Germany and Italy Indignant</h3>
<p>(London) All evening newspapers yesterday published special editions, which is clear evidence of London's close attention to President Roosevelt's speech. Officials have not yet commented on the speech, but political commentators have expressed their opinions, saying that the US President's speech can be expected to encourage all the people of European democracies. The Star stated that the speech was very frank. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Britain today expressed a warm welcome to President Roosevelt's hard-line stance against aggression. In particular, it showed great interest in three key points in President Roosevelt's address, namely: (1) Amending the Neutrality Act so that aggressor nations do not take advantage; (2) Democratic countries do not need war to strike aggressors; (3) Reaffirming the US proposal to consult with major powers to stop aggression, limit armaments, and revive commerce. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) When US President Roosevelt advocated amending the current Neutrality Act in his address to Congress today, diplomatic and political figures here were deeply impressed, saying that President Roosevelt's move is a further guide to American public opinion, so that it can understand that all countries with the same ideals must establish a common defense line. It is still unknown whether the Neutrality Act amendment will be submitted immediately. In addition, President Roosevelt also denounced the dictatorships in his address, with words as severe as those in the speech given by US Secretary of the Interior Ickes on the 18th of last month. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) President Roosevelt's address to Congress today has been unanimously praised by French political figures, who said that it is a practical warning to the dictatorships. The section criticizing the current Neutrality Act is a comment on the European situation, and it is the first time that it has been explained that countries neighboring aggressor nations are in great danger. This view has always been held in France, which shows that the viewpoints of the United States and France are becoming closer. As far as the safety of the United States is concerned, if the various demands made by Germany on the colonial issue are satisfied, then the naval bases that the country can set up in its future colonial territories will not be far from the US territory, which is not in the interest of the United States. President Roosevelt has now advocated taking various measures to prevent this threat, which is commendable. In short, the tone of President Roosevelt's address today is firm, exactly the same as the note sent by the US government to Japan on December 30 last year, which is welcome. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) People here generally expressed appreciation for the US President's brave and frank speech. However, the Fascist side was deeply resentful of the United States' hard-line attitude towards attacking the aggression of authoritarian countries. Therefore, official newspapers are now preparing to attack the President in their commentaries. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Political commentators commented on President Roosevelt's speech, saying that its wording was more cautious than his recent speeches, hoping that President Roosevelt's speech would have a positive impact on the public declarations made by those who cooperate with President Roosevelt in the future. However, they strongly opposed President Roosevelt's criticism of the situation in Germany. A political commentator told a Reuters reporter that Roosevelt's remarks showed that he lacked knowledge. Roosevelt's mention of the threats to civil religion and international faith cannot be said of Germany. We are now at peace with Britain and France, and we do not want to attack the sister countries of the United States. This is all fantasy, saying that we are trying to disturb the peace of democratic countries, which is absolutely impossible. We do not want to eliminate any other doctrines except Bolshevism, and we do not want to threaten religion. The Jewish question is not a religious question. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After US President Roosevelt read his address to Congress today, Italian political figures were deeply impressed, saying that the policy promoted by the United States will increasingly be unfavorable to the dictatorships, which is worrying. The relationship between the United States and Italy was not very good, and it may become worse in the future. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>US Budget Proposal Submitted to Congress by the President</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has prepared the budget for this year and submitted next year's budget to Congress today. When submitting this year's revised budget and next year's budget, the President said that by the end of 1940, the national expenditure deficit had reached $4,458,000,000. According to the 1940 budget, total expenditures were $8,995,663,000 and revenue was $5,669,320,000, so there was a total shortage of $3,326,343,000. The President said that according to the above budget, revenue increased by $194,000,000 compared with last year, because national business conditions are expected to improve next year. Of the expenditures, $2,266,000,000 is for relief and reconstruction work. The budget for this year (up to June 30 this year) has been revised because revenue is less than originally budgeted due to poor business conditions. According to the original budget, expenditures were $9,492,329,000 and revenue was $5,520,070,000, with a shortage of $3,972,259,000. Revenue decreased by $399,000,000 compared with January last year, and also decreased compared with revenue in 1939, because business conditions were poor in the last few months of 1937 and the first few months of 1938. Estimated income tax will decrease by $548,000,000,000,000, a decrease compared to 1938. Expenditures include $3,187,000,000 for full-year relief, an increase of $951,000,000 compared to last year. At the same time, national defense expenditures have also increased to $53,000,000. According to his estimate, by June 30, national debt will reach $41,131,000,000. The President also said that some government financial institutions, such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank, whether they are profitable or loss-making, will be published in the budget.

<h3>French Prime Minister Daladier Inspects North African Defenses and Holds Grand Military Parade, One Battalion of Indigenous Soldiers Increased to East Africa</h3>
<p>Port of Gabès, Tunisia. Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier, accompanied by Tunisian Governor-General Labonne, and the Army and Air Force Chiefs of Staff, inspected the "Maginot Line" defense line in Tunisia today. Afterwards, he held a military parade in the small village of Antouniel. A total of 20,000 indigenous troops participated in the review, all equipped with the latest weapons, including mechanized units. After the review, the Prime Minister had lunch with the officers, and after the meal, he met with the leaders of various Arab tribes and newspaper reporters, expressing his gratitude for the Tunisian residents' loyalty to France. He then drove to the desert area near the border of Tunisia and Italian Libya to inspect the garrison, and returned here at 8:15 pm. At that time, the entire city was brightly lit, and the streets were crowded with people. Many people gathered near the hotel where Daladier was staying, cheering and paying tribute, vying to catch a glimpse of his style. Daladier immediately came out to the balcony to express his thanks and read the congratulatory message issued by President Lebrun, which stated, "The people of France are united in their loyalty to the motherland, which has been demonstrated by your Excellency's trip." Upon hearing this, the crowd burst into applause and shouted "Long live France," "Long live Lebrun," and "Long live Daladier" before dispersing. At this point, Prime Minister Daladier made a radio broadcast speech, saying that he was deeply gratified by the enthusiastic welcome from the people everywhere on this trip. The indigenous leaders said at the military parade today that if France needs anything in the future, they will always be ready to be driven, which is commendable. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Port of Marseille. A battalion of Senegalese indigenous infantry from French West Africa, originally stationed in southern France, has been ordered to depart for the Port of Djibouti in French East Africa on the 6th of this month to strengthen defense. The garrison in the Port of Djibouti originally had only one battalion. However, because Italy coveted the French Somaliland in East Africa, one battalion has been dispatched there. Now another battalion has been sent, making a total of three battalions. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Governor of the Bank of England Norman Arrives in Germany</h3>
<p>(London) Norman, Governor of the Bank of England, arrived in Berlin at 8:30 this morning to attend the baptism of the grandson of Dr. Schacht, Governor of the German Central Bank. According to well-informed sources, Norman will take the opportunity to discuss the issue of Jewish emigration with Schacht in order to establish a compromise plan. (Havas, 5th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Warlords Realize Dictatorship, Hiranuma Kiichirō Forms New Cabinet, Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministers Retained, Konoe Serves as Minister Without Portfolio, Took Office in Palace Yesterday, Declared Resolution to Implement Previous Cabinet's Policy, Chinese Unity Strengthens, Not Afraid of Any Pressure</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After being ordered to form a cabinet, Hiranuma Kiichirō presented the list of cabinet members to the Emperor this afternoon, and the Emperor immediately accepted it. The new cabinet then took the oath of office. The new cabinet is a "National Concentration Cabinet" and is supported by members of the Japanese Fascist Party. The cabinet members of the Konoe Cabinet, except for Konoe himself who serves as President of the Privy Council and still joins the cabinet meetings, Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro, Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa, Justice Minister Shiono Suehiko, and Education Minister Araki Sadao are all retained. The new Finance Minister is Ishiwata Sotaro, who is the former Director-General of the Ministry of Finance. The new Interior Minister is Kido Kōichi, who was the former Minister of Health and Welfare. The new Minister of Commerce is Hatta Yoshiaki, who was the former Minister of Colonial Affairs. In addition, Seiyukai leader Maeda Yonezō serves as Minister of Railways. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The investiture ceremony of the new cabinet members was held in the palace at 7:30 this evening. Afterwards, Hiranuma convened a short cabinet meeting and then issued a declaration, stating that he would continue the policy of the previous cabinet and implement the consistent policy on the China Incident adopted at the Imperial Conference in early December last year. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is said that before agreeing to remain in office, Army Minister Itagaki consulted with the leaders of the military and told Hiranuma that the military hoped that the cabinet could absolutely adhere to its policy towards China announced on December 22, in order to achieve the final goal based on the resolute and decisive policy adopted at the Imperial Conference. It is heard that Itagaki also expressed the military's views on the national defense and rearmament procedures required to cope with the East Asian crisis, and the military's various hopes for further strengthening the anti-communist power of the three countries, strengthening the national general mobilization system, expanding national production capacity, promoting national spirit, and encouraging overseas trade. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, diplomatic circles said that on the surface, the Hiranuma Cabinet is weaker than the Konoe Cabinet, but the dismissal of Interior Minister Suetsugu has improved Japan's domestic relations. The new cabinet's policy towards China will continue Konoe's doctrine, but will adopt a more moderate policy towards domestic affairs. They pointed out that Hiranuma used to have Fascist tendencies, but has now transformed into a more moderate figure. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared yesterday that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet indicates that the government's policy is becoming more and more radical. The new Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichirō will adhere to the anti-communist policy and step up military action in an attempt to end the war in a short period of time. The spokesman solemnly stated that China is fully prepared to deal with any consequences of the new developments in the Japanese government. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese newspapers attach great importance to the news of the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet. The Japanese new cabinet is more likely to cooperate with the radical faction. Ta Kung Pao believes that the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet can be said to be a failure of Japanese liberalism and the establishment of a warlord dictatorship. As for China's attitude, Chinese newspapers unanimously stated that China is prepared to resist Japanese oppression. After the Chinese government broke away from those with weak wills and ulterior motives, the unity is becoming stronger, and the situation has not changed. Even if the Japanese increase pressure, there is nothing to worry about. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has received telegrams from military and civilian agencies and individuals, stating their sincere support and determination to resist Japan to the end, and requesting that strict measures be taken to maintain discipline, eliminate those with wavering wills, and boost morale. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Chinese in London told a Reuters reporter, "It doesn't matter to us who is in power in Tokyo. We will fight as before, but a more extreme Japanese government may be beneficial to us because it will accelerate the opportunity for the Japanese people to revolt." (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>List of New Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After being ordered to form a cabinet yesterday evening, Hiranuma only got a few hours of sleep after an all-night meeting, and has completed his work today. All the important cabinet members of the previous cabinet, except for Finance Minister Ikeda who resigned and was promoted by Director-General Ishiwata, have retained their original positions. In the new cabinet, Seiyukai leader Maeda serves as Minister of Railways, and the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry had been obtained by Machida's comrade from the Minseitō, but Machida declined, so Sakurauchi, an advisor to the Minseitō, was appointed instead.</p>
<p>The list of new cabinet members is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hiranuma Kiichirō</p>
<p>Minister without Portfolio Konoe Fumimaro</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro (retained)</p>
<p>Interior Minister Kido Kōichi</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ishiwata Sotaro</p>
<p>Army Minister Itagaki Seishiro (retained)</p>
<p>Navy Minister Yonai Mitsumasa (retained)</p>
<p>Justice Minister and Minister of Communications Shiono Suehiko</p>
<p>Education Minister Araki Sadao (retained)</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry and Minister of Colonial Affairs Hatta Yoshiaki (retained)</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Sakurauchi</p>
<p>Minister of Railways Maeda Yonezō</p>
<p>Minister of Health and Welfare Hirose</p>
<p>Chief Secretary of the Cabinet Tanabe Harumichi (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, Hiranuma and Konoe had a meeting, and they completely agreed on the policy of continuing the war against China of the previous cabinet. After the meeting, Konoe told visiting reporters that he and Hiranuma freely and frankly exchanged views. Japanese newspapers all say that the new cabinet is actually a joint cabinet of Hiranuma and Konoe, or a continuation of the Konoe Cabinet. All cabinet members are dispersed, with eight of them retained and two promoted by former cabinet directors. Konoe has been appointed as Privy Councilor, and as expected, he will attend important cabinet meetings as a minister without portfolio. The new Minister of Railways Maeda served as Minister of Railways in the Hirota Cabinet in 1936 and Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Inukai Tsuyoshi Cabinet in 1931. Now he represents the Seiyukai in the cabinet. The new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Sakurauchi, is known as the brain of the Minseitō and served as Minister of Commerce and Industry in the Wakan Cabinet in 1931. Now he represents the Minseitō in the cabinet. As for the new Finance Minister Ishiwata, he was in the same class as Konoe in middle school. After graduating from the Imperial University Law School in 1916, he joined the Ministry of Finance and served as Director-General for the past two years. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Under the Leadership of Chairman Chiang, China's Determination to Resist Japan is Resolute, Signs of Internal Turmoil in Japan Have Been Seen, Ambassador Guo Delivers Speech in London</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to the UK Guo Taiqi said in a speech at the London National Trade Union Club yesterday that the Chinese people's determination to fight to the end in order to achieve a fair and lasting peace has been strengthened. The whole country supports the leadership of Chairman Chiang. Japan's peace terms are a fraudulent attempt to make China an appendage. If Japan does not change its policy towards China, China has no other way but to continue the war of resistance. At present, Japan has discovered signs of internal turmoil, and China has shown no signs of weakness, so there is no possibility of surrender. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Embassy in Paris Issues Statement Clarifying Rumors</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chinese Embassy issued a statement today, stating that "The rumors in Shanghai that the Chinese Ambassador to France or the Embassy telegraphed General Chiang Kai-shek or the National Government, requesting that they accept the peace proposal put forward by the former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe on December 22 last year, are not true. The Chinese nation, under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek, has the determination to achieve final victory, which is well known in the theoretical circles. It is hoped that they will not be deceived by false propaganda." (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>British and French Observations on the Japanese Political Situation, The New Cabinet's Life May Not Be Sustainable</h3>
<p>(London) All evening newspapers published the news of the resignation of the Japanese cabinet in large characters, with headlines such as "Fascism Defeats Japanese Prime Minister." The Japanese in London deeply regretted Konoe's resignation, saying that while he was in office, he was still able to balance the forces of all parties and resist the worst demands of the extreme military elements, especially after the occupation of Hankou and Guangzhou by the Japanese. Konoe was disappointed by the failure of his proposed peace terms with China, because he had great hopes for them, so this matter was probably the final reason for his resignation. It is said that the new Prime Minister Hiranuma belongs to the radical nationalist faction and is an extremist. He is not popular in Japan. The retirement of the former Finance Minister Ikeda is regrettable, because everyone recognizes him as the most capable candidate for Finance Minister. The Japanese in London are very worried about who will succeed as Finance Minister. According to predictions here, the two major political parties in Japan, the Seiyukai and the Minseitō, will fight hard against the military's plan to organize a new political party in the Fascist manner, just like in the springs and autumns of 1936 and 1937. If the above plan is realized, it will in fact make the parliament useless. If the two major parties make this struggle, they may win the support of the Japanese people. According to precise observers, the new cabinet may not be permanent. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the resignation of the Konoe Cabinet, French newspapers have commented that this is a major victory for the extremist faction of the Japanese military, and the tense relations between the United States and Japan will definitely become more and more serious. Among them, the far-right small newspaper Daily News stated that the Japanese military wants to carry out a full-scale war and does not allow the establishment of a compromise plan. The United States, in order to protect international law and safeguard its own interests, will inevitably be forced to fight Japan. The great competition between the Anglo-Saxon group and the group of omnipotent countries has begun. The Radical Socialist Republican News stated, "The United States' tougher attitude towards Japan is enough to add significant assistance to China. The Japanese military's extremist faction may immediately accept this provocation, which is not necessarily true. However, Japan's military strength and resources are becoming increasingly scarce, and public opinion is becoming increasingly uneasy, which must also be taken into consideration." The Stone Sect's Liberal News stated, "After the current war continues for some time, I am afraid there will be no end to it, which Japan is deeply afraid of and eager to end." "On the contrary, the determination of China's Military Commission Chairman General Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese people to resist is becoming increasingly firm." The Communist Party's Humanist News stated that the Hiranuma Cabinet is a "transitional cabinet" and is responsible for continuing to promote the policies of the former Prime Minister Konoe. How long this cabinet can last is difficult to predict. What is known is that the length of its life will be determined by the attitude of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States towards the German, Italian, and Japanese groups. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, responsible persons here believe that it is a victory for the Fascist faction. The Soviet Russian official TASS news agency pointed out that Konoe's resignation was due to the pressure of the military, because the military faction blamed Konoe for Japan's failure to destroy General Chiang Kai-shek. (Haitong, 5th)</p>
<h3>American Figures Offer Comments; Economic Sanctions Against Japan – The Time Is Ripe</h3>
<p>(Washington) Following the resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet and the appointment of Privy Council President Hiranuma Kiichirō to form a new cabinet, responsible figures in the United States have offered comments, generally stating that he represents the Japanese Fascist faction and that his succession as prime minister is intended to form a cabinet necessary for continuing the war and territorial expansion. Now is the time when the application of economic sanctions against that country would be most effective. Regarding the interests held by the United States in China, Japan has already adopted various discriminatory measures and cut off traffic between Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and the Chinese interior, effectively bringing Sino-American commerce to a standstill. The U.S. government may summon Ambassador Grew back to the country to report, so that the means of implementing the policy advocated by President Roosevelt in his message, namely, to deal with aggressive countries with strong measures, can be discussed. This is not beyond possibility. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Watches Cabinet Change in Japan; Believes End of War Is Deceptive</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is paying close attention to both the resignation of the Japanese cabinet and the organization of the new cabinet, and expresses the opinion that this cabinet change will increase the strength of Japanese foreign policy. At the same time, the German officialdom has no comment on this matter, pending the completion of the new cabinet. The Berliner Tageblatt writes that "Konoe's resignation seems to clarify the comments made by various Japanese newspapers at the end of last year, namely, '2939 [1939] will be the year for unifying diplomatic policy and integrating the three aspects of naval, land, and diplomatic policies.'" Examining the history of the Konoe Cabinet, it can be seen that its first requirement for unifying foreign policy has not yet been fulfilled. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Following the general resignation of the Japanese Konoe Cabinet, Privy Council President Hiranuma Kiichirō has been ordered to form a new cabinet. German political figures are commenting extensively, generally stating that Hiranuma is known as the "father of Japanese Fascism." Regarding the war between China and Japan, although Japan holds a military advantage, the peace overtures from Wang Jingwei have been unanimously rejected by the Chinese side, so the end of the war is virtually nowhere in sight. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>US Denies Recalling Ambassador to Japan; Grew's Return This Spring Is Routine Leave</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the State Department denied that the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, has been recalled. The State Department stated that the government has approved Grew's request for leave to return to the United States this spring, and that Grew's return is not a recall, nor does it have the significance of returning for consultations. However, it is natural that Grew will meet with U.S. State Department officials upon his return. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Germany Arrives in Italy to Meet Shiratori</h3>
<p>San Remo, Italy – Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, arrived here yesterday and held important talks with the country's Ambassador to Italy, Toshio Shiratori. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japan-Soviet Fisheries Negotiations Continue; No Progress Seen</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the fishery agreement issue, an official of the Japanese embassy stated that negotiations are continuing to some extent, but there is no prospect of a conclusion in the short term. Furthermore, regarding the labor dispute at the Japanese oil company on Northern Sakhalin, the current talks have also shown no progress. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Observations Along the Guangdong-Guangxi Roads After the Fall of Guangzhou (Part Two); Refugees Overcrowded, Many Killed and Injured; Cities and Towns Bombed</h3>
<p>South of the river, there are two routes that refugees must take to evacuate (as there were no boats, only land routes available). One is from Shek Wai Tong along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway to Sanshui, and the other is from Fangcun via Zhao Village and Pingzhou to Chancun. Therefore, those fleeing can take either route if they can cross the river. After the reporter arrived in Fangcun, it was said that the Shek Wai Tong route was extremely congested. Generally, the fleeing masses all said that Shek Wai Tong had trains for transportation. Even if the trains were too crowded, they could walk along the railway. Therefore, there were particularly many refugees on this route. Trains ran all night, departing every two hours, but they could not carry everyone. The number of people walking along the railway was uncountable. The reporter thought that the Guangzhou-Sanshui trains were often bombed by planes, which would inevitably cause delays and danger along the way. Also, there were so many refugees that even with trains, weak individuals like myself could not compete for a ride. Therefore, I changed course and headed west. In the early morning of the 21st, I left Fangcun on foot, taking the route through Zhao Village and Pingzhou to Chancun. Unexpectedly, there were also tens of thousands of refugees on this route, all aiming for Chancun as a temporary destination. The fifty-odd li from Fangcun to Chancun (under the jurisdiction of Shunde) had village defense corps stationed along the way to protect and guide the route. The ferry crossings did not demand extra fees, and the order was fairly good. Halfway, we heard loud explosions from Guangzhou. At noon, three Japanese planes flew over and dropped several bombs on the new market of Chancun's Bijiang estuary, destroying the Huian tile kiln. They also dropped several bombs on the Lintou Station (connecting to the Daliang highway), killing and injuring five or six people. It is said that this was the first time Japanese planes bombed Chancun. As a result, the local people panicked. Chen and the provincial capital are only forty or fifty li apart. If traveling by ship, it would take only two hours to arrive. Now that the provincial capital had fallen, Chancun naturally could not be considered safe. At that time, there were two refugee camps in the market, but they could not accommodate the large number of people. Vacant ancestral halls and street corners were filled with refugees, shivering and exposed to the elements, in a very miserable state. After nightfall, we could hear the sound of cannons and bombs from Guangzhou all night long. On the morning of the 22nd, hundreds of policemen from the Guangzhou Police Department fled to Chancun. More than a hundred officials from various administrative organs also came here to take refuge or transferred to Daliang. It is said that on the morning of the 21st, there were no more soldiers or police maintaining order in Guangzhou. The city was in chaos, and traitors and local thugs took the opportunity to steal and set fires. Until the night of the 22nd, the fire had not yet been extinguished. Looking north from Chancun, the sky was all red. That morning, the police station in the market ordered all ships anchored on the river to sail to the Sanshui estuary for concentration to prevent them from being used by the Japanese. The population in the market was also ordered to evacuate, and all business in the market came to a standstill.</p>
<p>In the early morning of the 23rd, the reporter left Chancun and headed west, planning to stay at Guanshan Market in Xiqiao. Guanshan is sixty-odd li from Chancun. Along the way, we passed through Lecong in Shunde and Jili in Nanhai before reaching Guanshan. At noon, we passed through Lecong. The highway bridge next to the market (the Jiang-Fo Highway) had been blown up automatically the day before (the 22nd). According to a township head in the market, all eleven iron bridges on the Jiang-Fo Highway were ordered to be blown up on the 22nd. The vehicles on the road that had not been transferred had also been completely dismantled, with the wheels and important parts scattered and parked in various villages. Therefore, traffic on the road was completely stopped. However, the people of Lecong were still calm as usual, and the stores were operating as usual. Due to the increase in the refugee population, business was twice as lively. Most people did not yet know that Guangzhou had fallen. In the tea houses and restaurants, those who talked about Guangzhou being lost were mostly incredulous. They all believed that the Guangdong army's resistance was particularly strong, and the defensive fortifications had been in place for more than a year. Even if the Japanese army attacked fiercely, they would be able to resist desperately and hold out for a month or two, not fall so easily. But their ideals and reality were completely opposite. By the time we reached Jili, the situation in the market was the same as in Lecong. When we arrived at Guanshan, the sun was already setting, and the sky was approaching dusk. About twenty or more small electric boats and tugboats were docked on the Guanshan River, most of which were requisitioned by the authorities and awaiting dispatch. Most of the staff of the Nanhai County Government and the county party headquarters had moved to the market. Merchants and residents from the provincial capital, Foshan, Chancun, and Lanshi had also fled here. For a time, the population of Guanshan increased sharply, and business was also abnormally prosperous. Although the market is under the jurisdiction of Nanhai, it is located in the western corner, and its location is at the foot of Xiqiao Mountain, so the traffic is not important. Therefore, for more than a year of the war of resistance, Japanese planes have not come here to harass. Those who took refuge regarded it as a safe haven. Unexpectedly, on the 24th, Japanese planes bombed, and the losses were incalculable. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Story of Cheng Wanjun's Defection to the Japanese from the Dahu Guerrilla Force; Cheng's Troops Are Now Stationed on the Lakeside, Committing All Kinds of Evil</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Since the National Army retreated west the year before last, the people's resistance forces have been secretly organized and active in the villages of various places. The Taihu Lake area has also become a base for the people's armed forces. Originally, the Taihu Lake area is a water town, relying on the complexity of the crisscrossing rivers and the lush growth of aquatic plants, making it difficult for the enemy's shallow-water warships to operate. The muddy and narrow land routes are not suitable for the use of cannons and tanks. At first, there was the Southeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, whose leader was Cheng Wanjun. Cheng was originally a low-ranking officer of a certain division and was stationed in Kunshan. In November of the year before last, he retreated to Taihu Lake, met with local patriots, contacted troops from various routes, strengthened the organization, and worked hard to establish the Volunteer Army. In January of last year, the army's headquarters was stationed in Nanku. After a brief encounter with the Japanese army, they retreated to Dongshan. Because the members of the troops were complex and mostly corrupt, they did not gain the trust of the people. The local wealthy people reported to Gong Guoliang, the head of the Suzhou puppet water police brigade, and planned an encirclement. Therefore, Xi Guoliang, together with more than 1,000 Japanese troops, advanced by land and water on the morning of January 15th, and carried out bombing with airplanes. At this time, Cheng Wanjun led his troops through three days and nights of resistance, and withdrew from Dongshan on January 18th, causing the troops to scatter and hide in the lakeside area. Generally, the scum took the opportunity to make excessive demands on the people, making it difficult for them to bear. The most loyal and brave in Cheng's troops was Tian Wenlong, the commander of the Beitaihu garrison. After the Dongshan battle, Tian's troops retreated to Xishan. The Japanese army continued to pursue and attack Xishan. After three days and nights of resistance, due to lack of food, they retreated to Majishan in West Taihu Lake to build up their strength. In March, Tian Wenlong was discovered by the Japanese for destroying bridges and obstructing Japanese traffic. The Japanese sent a team to attack Majishan. Tian Wenlong took the lead and fought fiercely for four days and nights, killing more than 500 Japanese soldiers. More than 300 members of Tian's troops made heroic sacrifices. Tian was also slightly injured. On March 16, he withdrew from Majishan and led his troops to Hulou on the lakeside to heal his wounds.</p>
<p>After the Majishan battle, Cheng Wanjun stationed his headquarters in Lujia Port. After half a month of reorganization, he still restored his previous strength. At this time, he had troops from Tian Wenlong, Sun Ziqing, Cao Chunqing, Zeng Hong, Wang Qingshun, and others, totaling more than 4,000 people. However, there were many corrupt and ill-behaved officers and soldiers among them, even openly committing bandit-like evil deeds. The political leader of Cheng's troops was Jin Luwang. Jin was a frustrated politician who indulged in mahjong all day long and neglected political training. He only knew how to satisfy his personal life and used perfunctory and scheming means to deceive the youth. In June, Jin organized a political training office and appointed himself as the director, but before the arrangements were completed, he established a "Tax Bureau," which included more than ten kinds of taxes, such as special tax, slaughter tax, cigarette business tax, liquor tax, miscellaneous tax, salt tax, tooth tax, and boat tax. The tax rate was so high that it was practically disregarding the law of the land. The lakeside area, from Hengjing in the east to Daqian in the west, could collect an estimated seven or eight thousand yuan per month. In addition to these donations, the people were also required to bear monthly donations, household donations, and local maintenance donations, which were collected by a certain Ye of the Economic Council. It was estimated that eight or nine thousand yuan could be collected per month from the townships. Not satisfied with maintaining 17,000 to 18,000 yuan, the troops stationed in the villages also required the people to bear the cost of meals.</p>
<p>In August, the Japanese troops in Nanxun and Zhenze secretly retreated east because the Jiashan guerrillas attacked the city. Cheng's troops under Sun Ziqing arrived in Zhenze first, and Gan Qingshun's troops also arrived in Zhenze the next day. Tian Wenlong arrived in Nanxun first. At first, the people in the two towns hung up the national flag to express their welcome, and the mood for resistance was very high. Unfortunately, Cheng's troops had no laws or discipline. Therefore, when they were about to retreat back to the lakeside, they carried out looting on a large scale, causing great resentment among the people. Zhu Xi, the commander of the Jiangnan First Advance Army, was stationed in Wuzhen, Yanji, and Xinshi. He usually resisted fiercely and inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army. In August, Cheng's troops under Gong Yinong were stationed in Shuanglin. The scum in his troops often harassed the people in the surrounding villages, causing deep resentment among the people. The people reported to Xinshi. Zhu Xi received an order from Commander Zhang on August 20 to encircle and suppress Gong's troops. Gong learned about it in advance and fled to the lakeside.</p>
<p>In July, Cheng's troops had been reorganized into the Loyalty Army Taihu Action Corps, but the military discipline was still not in order, and the troops were not suitable for legal organization. Therefore, each unit became a phenomenon of few guns and many people. Even in each brigade, the number of people ranged from five or six hundred to as few as ten or more. Tian Wenlong was known as the most loyal and brave in the war of resistance. Unfortunately, Tian was violent and lacked political awareness. In October, because he did not agree with Cheng's surrender to the enemy and strongly opposed it at the meeting, Cheng used the pretext that Tian disobeyed orders and attempted to rebel to mobilize troops, disarm Tian's entire force, and shoot Tian's legs with machine guns. Tian's whereabouts are now unknown.</p>
<p>After Tian was eliminated by Cheng Wanjun, a certain Xie, the head of the Wujiang puppet police brigade, came to the lakeside at the instigation of the Japanese to secretly discuss several decisions with Cheng Wanjun. Cheng then decided to surrender to the enemy and went to Wujiang on November 25 to contact the Japanese. The Japanese sent people to Nanku on the 27th to inspect and recruit Cheng's troops. At this time, soldiers who were determined to resist the Japanese and local strongmen who were unwilling to surrender to the Japanese fled one after another, causing the number of people to be insufficient. At this time, Cheng used his old trick of "conscripting men" from the people to supplement the numbers in order to gain the trust of the Japanese and make a contribution to surrender.</p>
<p>Now, in the lakeside area, since Cheng Wanjun surrendered to the Japanese, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes have continued to be collected. At the same time, Jin Luwang also established a "Food Support Association for Resisting the Enemy," collecting a land tax of one yuan and four corners of national currency per mu and another two dou of white rice per mu. Therefore, Jin Luwang extracted most of the farmers' annual hard-earned income. It is said that Cheng's surrender to the enemy resulted in the Japanese allocating tens of thousands of yuan per month. Therefore, not only could the exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes not be abolished, but they were used in the name of "supporting the resistance against the enemy" to plunder the blood and sweat of the people. Such wanton exploitation of the people is truly hateful. The troops currently stationed in the lakeside area under Cheng's command include those of Cao Chunqing and Sun Ziqing. Cao Chunqing is stationed in Wu Lou, and Sun Ziqing is stationed in Lujia Port. These fellows specialize in "setting out" in the name of conscription, looting in various villages. Therefore, those in the lakeside area who have a little to eat have been completely plundered by these fellows. Farmers dare not go to Wu Lou and Lujia Port during the day and sleep next to the fields at night to prevent being conscripted. In this early winter cold, they are all crying out in pain.</p>
<h3>Brief News from the Yong River; Strictly Prohibit Smoking and Gambling in Fishing Areas; Direct Bus Service Between Jinhua and Ningbo</h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: Xu Zhen, Commissioner of the Sixth Administrative District of Zhejiang and concurrently Commander of the Security Forces, considered the Zhoushan Islands to be the foremost of China's four major fishing areas. However, every fishing season, when fishermen gather, there are often ruffians and hooligans who run brothels, set up gambling dens, and sell opium, luring the fishermen. This kind of evil practice has caused great harm to the fishermen. Now that the fishing season has arrived and the war of resistance is in full swing, it is urgent to strictly investigate and prohibit these activities. He specially ordered the magistrates of Dinghai and other counties to strictly order their subordinates to investigate and prohibit these activities, either by going to the towns to suppress them in person, or by sending personnel to garrison them, in order to weed out the bad elements and pacify the good, and to eliminate the decadent customs. The Commissioner's Office will also send personnel to inspect and investigate at any time.</p>
<p>The plan to operate direct bus service between Jinhua and Ningbo, which has been hindered for some time, has been approved by the Provincial Department of Transportation. It has been decided that the Provincial Highway Bureau and the Yin-Feng Long-Distance Bus Company will jointly operate the service. All preparations have been completed, and the service is scheduled to officially open on the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>According to tennis circles, Philippine top tennis players Quevedo and Santos went to Hong Kong for performances at the end of last year and will be leaving Hong Kong to return home soon. If they pass through Shanghai, they may hold one or two exhibition matches. However, according to general speculation, the climate in the Philippines and Hong Kong is warmer, while the severe cold here is not suitable for tennis, so it is unlikely to become a reality.</p>
<h3>New Six Table Tennis Finals Postponed</h3>
<p>The New Liu Cup table tennis tournament organized by the Zhejiang Industrial Bank colleagues was originally scheduled to have its finals at Lake Society at 7:00 PM on the 7th of this month.

<h3>Novel Development in the Sports World</h3>
<p>— Li Ren, dispatched from The Hague</p>
<p>(European Communications) Mr. Liangcai, the late curator of the Shen Bao, once said, "The newspaper is a mirror of society." The meaning is that the written spirit advances with the state of society. The New Year's publications of major newspapers in advanced Western countries are often dominated by "Sports Special Issues," occupying a significant portion, on par with the year's major events lists and retrospectives. This shows that strong countries rely on strong physiques and cultivate the national spirit of striving for self-improvement. Now, all kinds of games and amusements, commonly spread programs, all have united organizations. Universal harmony, such as the special competitions in countries like England, America, and France, has become a popular pastime in certain regions or social groups. Observing the reason why they can be new and unique, it generally starts from the mutual integration of two kinds of sports. By observing the following ten sections, one can silently understand the origin of the evolution of new sports techniques.</p>
<p>(1) Adding ice skating blades to the soles of shoes to play ice hockey. Ice hockey has been seen in the Winter World Games and world championships have been held.</p>
<p>(2) Stepping on ice skating wheels to play tennis on ice. Ice tennis is still rare in various countries.</p>
<p>(3) Simulating slalom skiing, using paddles on the water surface to pass through gates. This method has been created recently. It uses a small, light kayak, driven in a zigzag pattern on the water surface, passing through very low gates. In terms of speed, it is far from being as fast as skiing down a slope, but it requires overcoming many difficulties like an obstacle course, which is very laborious.</p>
<p>(4) Wearing skis and holding a long rope connected to a speedboat, using the power of the speedboat to move quickly: "Aquaplane" As the Chinese character explains, "'flying down and spreading wings in the air is called 'xiang' (翔)," which is similar to the meaning of the Western word "Plane." This game was created seven years ago and is the invention of Norwegian skiing champion Petersen. It is now popular on the French Riviera. The skis on the water must reach a high speed of 60 kilometers per hour (that is, progressing at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour) before they can float. At this time, the person breaking the waves and speeding forward can stand upright. If the speed of the speedboat is not very high, the person standing behind may lose balance and fall into the water immediately.</p>
<p>(5) Lying prone on a board, using both arms to paddle for speed on the water. The body should lie in the middle and slightly behind the center of the long board, with the back half sinking and the front half slightly raised. This game is suitable for summer, testing it on the water surface where the waves are neither too strong nor too weak. Once the oarsman is familiar with it, he can prepare it himself without worrying. It is said that in the water towns of America, there will even be a three-mile (that is, five kilometers) derby for comparing the speed of paddling with both arms. The winner relies on shoulder strength to win the championship, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>(6) The water surface non-fall game, which maintains the balance of the center of gravity, is based on standing upright on a narrow and unstable rowing boat, extending both arms to the left and right, and quickly turning them to replace the propeller. The boat moves very slowly, and it is very difficult for the body not to fall into the water. This is a kind of "interlude" used in competitions for entertainment.</p>

<p>Shanghai Special Issue</p>
<h3>A Brief Chronicle of the Great Shanghai in Ten Years</h3>
<p>— Xuan Nan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipality was established on July 7, 1927 (16th year of the Republic), initially named the Shanghai Special Municipality, directly under the National Government. Huang Fu was appointed as the first mayor of the city. After taking office, Mayor Huang, based on the Provisional Regulations for the Shanghai Special Municipality promulgated by the National Government, appointed secretaries and bureau directors to take over various agencies and successively established the Secretariat and nine bureaus including Finance, Public Works, Public Security, Health, Public Utilities, Education, Land, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, and Public Welfare to manage municipal affairs, and formulated various rules and regulations for promulgation and implementation to be observed. He also drafted the scope of the city's area and presented it to the National Government to instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Government to send personnel to conduct a joint survey to clarify jurisdiction and clear authority. Mayor Huang resigned after only two months in office due to a recurrence of an old illness. The National Government then appointed Zhang Dingfan as the successor mayor, who took office on September 16. To conserve administrative expenses, Mayor Zhang abolished the Bureau of Public Welfare at the end of September, and all matters under the bureau's jurisdiction were transferred to other bureaus for handling according to their nature. Subsequently, he began to delineate the powers of the province and the city, determine the scope of the city's administrative area, and take over the various cities and townships of Shanghai and Baoshan counties, uniformly renaming them as regions.</p>
<p>On July 3, 1928 (17th year of the Republic), the National Government promulgated the Organic Law of Special Municipalities. The Municipal Government reorganized in accordance with the law starting on August 1. The Bureau of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce was renamed the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the other offices and bureaus remained the same. On December 25, the Port Authority was established to handle matters related to the city's river ports, shorelines, docks, and ships.</p>
<p>In March 1929 (18th year of the Republic), Mayor Zhang also resigned due to illness, and Zhang Qun succeeded him. After taking office on April 1, Mayor Zhang focused on reorganizing and transforming the existing construction in the old urban area, delineating the city center area, and striving to promote the realization of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Shanghai Plan. On May 20 of the following year, the National Government promulgated the Municipal Organization Law, renaming all special municipalities as municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan. The Municipal Government reorganized in accordance with the law starting on July 1 of the same year, and was renamed Shanghai Municipality. Except for the Port Authority, which was ordered to be suspended and abolished in December of the same year, the internal organization of each office and bureau was slightly changed, and the names remained the same. On July 7, 1931 (20th year of the Republic), the groundbreaking ceremony for the new municipal building in the city center area was held, and construction began, originally scheduled to be completed in the following year. Later, due to the changing situation, Mayor Zhang resigned due to illness in January of the following year.</p>
<p>On January 7, 1932 (21st year of the Republic), Wu Tiecheng was ordered to succeed as mayor. Not long after Mayor Wu took office, the January 28 Incident occurred, lasting for more than three months. The essence of the urban area was greatly destroyed. He relieved the disaster area, comforted the refugees, and worked hard to overcome the difficulties. At the same time, given the vastness of the urban area and the difficulty of maintaining public security, the Municipal Security Office was established on August 1 of the same year. For the work of reconstruction and post-disaster relief, and the completion of the construction of the city center area, he continued to advance in order to realize the plan of Greater Shanghai. In October of the following year, the Municipal Government Building was completed, and Mayor Wu scheduled the opening ceremony to be held at 10:00 AM on National Day. In December, the Municipal Government moved in to work.</p>
<p>On New Year's Day in 1934 (23rd year of the Republic), the Municipal Government held an opening ceremony, celebrating the founding anniversary of the Republic of China, and holding an enlarged commemorative group and New Year's group worship ceremony. In order to promote the prosperity of the city center area, various facilities that a modern city should have also began to be implemented one by one. In addition to widening roads and opening parks for the convenience of citizens, other important projects such as libraries, museums, sports fields, gymnasiums, swimming pools, hospitals, health experiment institutes, elementary schools, radio broadcasting stations, and the Qujiang Wharf were all built in order.</p>
<p>In 1935 (24th year of the Republic), libraries, museums, sports fields, hospitals, health experiment institutes, elementary schools, etc., had all been completed one after another. Elementary schools opened in February, and the sports field was handed over to the organizing committee of the Sixth National Games in September. The Sixth National Games were held from October 10 to 20, and the city center was crowded with vehicles and horses, reaching a peak. After the closing of the conference, the Municipal Government took over, and after approving the organizational regulations, it implemented the opening as a place for citizens to exercise and compete. From 1936 (25th year of the Republic) until the fall of Shanghai, libraries, museums, hospitals, health experiment institutes, etc., were all equipped and arranged before opening one after another. The Shanghai Municipal Sports College was also established in the sports field. The first phase of construction of the Qujiang Wharf was also completed and opened first. Other construction projects, such as building the Longhua Scenic Area, establishing the Pudong Water Plant, and expanding the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's urban area user lines, were all being realized or promoted. How could we know that the anniversary of the establishment of Shanghai Municipality on July 7 was chosen by the Japanese to create an incident as one day of the war of aggression against China? How could we know that more than a month after the Lugouqiao Incident, the war in Shanghai would also break out! In March, when the chairman of Guangdong Province passed away, the National Government ordered Mayor Wu to succeed as chairman, and the position of mayor of Shanghai was still held by Yu Hongjun as acting. After the outbreak of the war, Yu risked his life as mayor, directing the citizens to rise up and resist the enemy. After four months of resistance, Shanghai fell. However, the people's spirit of Shanghai has not declined to this day. They all believe that the final victory will belong to our country, and that Greater Shanghai will eventually be restored by the people of Shanghai. The revival of Greater Shanghai will still be operated and completed by the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Japan Attempts to Unilaterally Modify North China Customs Duties; British Consul General Submits Memorandum; Britain Decides Not to Recognize Japanese Tax Increases; Takes Retaliatory Measures If Necessary</h3>
<p>The Japanese side's attempts to modify North China's customs duties, increase the tariffs on goods imported from Britain and the United States, and monopolize the Far East trade market are all conspiracies for which they have spared no effort to implement. The British and American consulates in Shanghai have been ordered to investigate, and the reports obtained are very detailed. The American consul general has already lodged a protest a few days ago to stop the Japanese side's actions that infringe on the interests of third countries, and the wording is quite stern. It is learned that the British consul general in Shanghai also submitted a memorandum to the Japanese side yesterday, stating in essence that if the Japanese side attempts to unilaterally modify North China's customs duties, the British side will definitely not agree to recognize it. If various serious consequences arise from this matter, all responsibilities will be borne by the Japanese side. It also stated that if the Japanese side does not abandon this exclusionary policy, Britain will, when necessary, unite with other countries to take retaliatory measures.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Transfers Tax Revenue to Zhengjin Bank; Accumulates Over 20 Million; This Money Is Purely for Repaying British and American Foreign Debts; Jianghai Customs Has No Surplus to Spend and the Japanese Cannot Use It</h3>
<p>A Express News Agency report from this city states that regarding the Jianghai Customs revenue, which is now forced to be transferred to Zhengjin Bank and suspended from being remitted to the government, Express News Agency reporters have investigated with the Jianghai Customs authorities. It is learned that the Jianghai Customs is in an unfavorable position, suffering repeated pressure on tax revenue issues. Since June of last year, it has been forced to transfer revenue to Zhengjin Bank. However, through the efforts of Mr. Luo Fu, although the revenue is transferred to Zhengjin Bank, it actually contains stringent conditions, that is, the Jianghai Customs revenue is still deposited in the Central Bank as usual, transferred by the Central Bank to the American-owned Maijiali Bank, and then deposited in Zhengjin Bank through Maijiali Bank. By the end of last year, it had reached more than 20 million yuan. However, there are three points that should be explained about this huge accumulation of tax revenue: 1. Jianghai Customs has no surplus since the war, so this tax revenue has not been remitted to the government and does not affect the national finances. 2. The tax revenue now transferred to Zhengjin Bank is purely for repaying foreign debts to Britain, the United States, etc., so it does not affect creditworthiness. 3. Jianghai Customs has no surplus since the war. The revenue now stored in Zhengjin Bank cannot be used by the Japanese, and there is not a single surplus available for distribution. As for the more than 20 million in tax revenue previously stored in HSBC Bank, it is still stored in HSBC, and this is also for repaying foreign debts.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Has Not Left Shanghai; Chu's Secretary Issues Statement; Denies Participating in Political Activities</h3>
<p>A Express News Agency report from this city states that there have been rumors that Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee who remained in Shanghai, secretly left Shanghai in recent days. Yesterday, when Express News Agency reporters visited Mr. Chu, Chu's secretary, Tian Shoucheng, issued a statement on behalf of Mr. Chu, solemnly denying the rumors that he had left Shanghai and that he was communicating with each other by letter and participating in political activities. According to Mr. Tian, since the National Army withdrew to the west last year, Mr. Chu has remained in Shanghai to devote himself to cultural undertakings and preside over the affairs of the Sino-French Industrial School, after going to Chongqing once to ask the Ministry of Education for educational guidelines. He has stayed away from political activities and has never had any correspondence with Wang. Regarding the Wang incident, Mr. Chu only saw it in the newspapers. However, it is a fact that he refused to criticize it due to his difficult position. But it must be solemnly stated that it has absolutely nothing to do with the matter. He has not left Shanghai and goes to the Sino-French School to work every morning. The same is true today (the 5th). Recently, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association expanded its fundraising and requested Mr. Chu to write 500 couplets to raise funds for disaster relief. Therefore, in his spare time every day, he is writing couplets at his residence, so he has temporarily declined to meet guests.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Scatter Absurd Leaflets; Attempt to Confuse People; Reveal Desire for Peace; Citizens Scorn Them</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Chongqing, 5th) Today, Japanese planes in Shanghai scattered leaflets printed with so-called telegrams from the Chinese ambassadors to Britain, France, and the United States to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek urging him to accept Wang Jingwei's peace proposals. A spokesman for the National Government said that this was a malicious fabrication intended to disturb the people's minds. Because a cabinet crisis occurred in Japan, causing a bad impression abroad, they are trying to spread malicious rumors that are unfavorable to China to divert the attention of the general public from Japan.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side launched the war of aggression against China, its dream of a quick victory has been shattered due to the strong resistance of the Chinese army. Now that the war has entered the second stage, the Chinese army has launched a large-scale guerrilla war, which has made the Japanese army even deeper in the quagmire and unable to extricate itself. In addition, the domestic industry and commerce in Japan are declining and the economy is in crisis, so the desire for peace is extremely urgent. Therefore, they are releasing peace air indiscriminately, hoping to confuse the Chinese people and destroy the anti-Japanese camp. However, China is united in sincerity and is becoming more and more consolidated. The whole country, from top to bottom, has always supported the war of resistance and will never be shaken. Since Wang Jingwei willingly betrayed and was used by the Japanese side to issue a peace telegram, the whole country has unanimously condemned him. Seeing that their plan failed, the Japanese side again sent several planes at about 9:00 AM yesterday to scatter absurd leaflets in the sky over this city, fabricating various rumors, falsely claiming that Chinese envoys abroad suggested peace methods, and that so-and-so supported Wang Jingwei's ideas. Their despicable intentions and childish actions are really ridiculous. Citizens throughout the city all sneered at the leaflets.</p>
<p>The English Great America Evening Post reported that from 9:45 this morning, two Japanese planes scattered two kinds of absurd leaflets in the sky north of the Suzhou River, which floated with the wind to the central area of the two concessions and fell to the ground. The leaflets were divided into yellow and green. One was Wang Jingwei's absurd telegram, with a small photo of him attached. The other was the so-called joint telegram for peace from Gu Weijun, the ambassador to France, Guo Taiqi, the ambassador to England, and Hu Shi, the ambassador to the United States. This move is nothing more than an attempt to create rumors and confuse the public. The two planes did not fly back until 10:30 AM.</p>
<h3>Pudong Guerrilla Encounter with Japanese Troops: Japanese Troops on High Alert Along Pudong Avenue</h3>
<p>Around noon the day before yesterday, over a hundred guerrillas suddenly appeared near Zhoupu Town in Pudong and engaged in an encounter with Japanese troops stationed in Zhoupu in the countryside. Although it was daytime, both sides used rifles and machine guns to counterattack. The Japanese troops, realizing the unfavorable terrain and fearing encirclement, dragged several small steel cannons from Zhoupu to bombard and assist in the battle. The rumbling sound shook the surrounding areas. By evening, guerrillas along the Zhangjialou area of the Pudong riverbank also showed a tendency to attack the Japanese naval defense zone on Pudong Avenue. The situation suddenly became extremely tense. The 3rd and 5th Battalions of the Japanese Navy were simultaneously mobilized with weapons. Emergency alerts were implemented along Pudong Avenue and Dongchang Road, and land and water transportation was blocked. Pedestrians disappeared from the streets, and Japanese sentries were stationed every three to five people. The Dongchang Road ferry was closed early at 5:10 PM. After the Japanese troops guarded the riverbank all night, seeing no movement, their terrified spirits finally settled down. At dawn, they dispersed into the countryside east of Pudong Avenue, searching civilian houses door to door, but found nothing. The Dongchang Road ferry reopened as usual at 2:00 AM yesterday. The alerts in various places also tended to relax, and land transportation returned to its original state. Regarding the Sino-Japanese military encounter the day before yesterday afternoon, it is said that ten Japanese soldiers were killed and more than twenty were wounded. It is reported that the guerrilla side suffered no losses.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Order Restored: Guerrillas Waiting for Reorganization; Ningbo Defense Command Sends Personnel to Investigate; Navigation Resumes Without Major Damage</h3>
<p>Following suppression by the authorities, the guerrilla uprising in Dinghai Island, Zhejiang Province, retreated to Hengliang, awaiting reorganization. Order in the county town has been completely restored, and transportation ships have resumed operations. The Ningbo City Defense Command has dispatched senior officials to Dinghai to investigate. Fenghua and other counties have established reward measures for arresting bandits. Detailed information is as follows:</p>
<p>This Newspaper's Telegram</p>
<p>Ningbo Special Telegram from this newspaper, dated the 4th: The Xuchengde unit of the Fengxian guerrilla force, which withdrew from Dinghai, has been ordered to be transferred to Xinchang for reorganization and training. On the 1st, they demanded 50,000 yuan from the county, but were refused. On the 2nd, they released prisoners and engaged in a two-hour battle with the First Water Police Team, resulting in five police and civilians dead and over ten injured. The next morning, reinforcements arrived, and Xu led his troops, along with the released prisoners, aboard the Tianma Wheel to retreat to Hengliang, awaiting reorganization. Order in Dinghai has been restored. On the 3rd, the defense department dispatched senior officials to investigate.</p>
<p>The Suppression Process</p>
<p>The Xuchengde unit of the guerrilla forces from Fengxian, Chuansha, and other places (formerly the Special Operations Unit of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee), totaling over three hundred people, was ordered to be transferred to Xinchang County in eastern Zhejiang for reorganization and training. After arriving in Dinghai by civilian ship at the end of December last year, they demanded 50,000 yuan from the local authorities on the 1st of this month, but were refused, and actually carried out an uprising. At that time, the local water police were ordered to suppress them, but due to their weak strength, the county town was occupied by the guerrillas. After the Haimen Water Police Team sent a company of water police, together with troops dispatched from Ningbo, to suppress them, the guerrillas were defeated and surrounded by the military police, forced to surrender their weapons, and escorted onto the Tianma Wheel to retreat to Hengliang.</p>
<p>Order Restored</p>
<p>This guerrilla force has been disarmed and concentrated in Hengliang, awaiting reorganization by the authorities. At the same time, a company of armed police officers was dispatched by the Water Police Headquarters, led by the captain, to Hengliang (located fifteen li outside the east gate of Nandinghai, it is a coastal town), to closely monitor them. The Tianma Wheel is a small steamer that operates between Dinghai and Shenjiamen. Order in Dinghai County was quickly restored. During the guerrilla uprising, approximately thirty water police officers were killed or injured. It is reported that over ten villagers were injured by stray bullets. Fortunately, there was no major damage in the area. The Ningbo City Defense Commander dispatched senior officials to Dinghai on the 3rd to investigate jointly with the county magistrate.</p>
<p>Navigation as Usual</p>
<p>The Dinghai Native Place Association in Shanghai and various shipping merchants received telegrams from Haimen and Ningbo yesterday, stating that order in Dinghai has been restored and the area is peaceful. As for the Dinghai radio station, it was damaged by the guerrillas at that time and has not yet been repaired, so it has not yet resumed reporting. Foreign ships operating between Haidou, Shipu, Dinghai, and Ningbo: (1) The American Huamei Company's Tangsai, which sailed from Haimen to Yong yesterday morning, decided to also stop at Dinghai. (2) The Portuguese Meili Company's Meida is allowed to sail from Ningbo to Haimen this morning and also decided to stop at Dinghai. (3) The Tianbao and Libao wheels, operating between Ningbo and Dinghai, have resumed normal operation from the 4th, restoring their original schedules.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>Guo Chiping, the Ningbo City Defense Commander, was very angry about the Dinghai incident. In addition to sending senior officials to Dinghai for investigation, he has telegraphed Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and Liu Jianxu, Commander-in-Chief of the Tenth Army Group, with detailed information on the guerrilla uprising and the suppression. He has also requested instructions on everything. It is reported that the superior officer of the guerrilla unit has been detained by the suppressing military police. After requesting instructions from higher authorities and deciding on a course of action, they will be severely punished. The remaining members of the team will still be transferred to Xinchang in eastern Zhejiang for reorganization.</p>
<p>Eliminating Bandits</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly eliminate bandits, the Fenghua County Government of Eastern Zhejiang, in addition to dispatching personnel to supervise the encirclement and suppression, has also ordered the military police and civilians to generously reward those who arrest bandits and bring them to justice or seize firearms and hand them over to the county, in order to encourage them. The measures are as follows: (1) 100 yuan reward for the arrest of a bandit leader. (2) A reward of 20 to 50 yuan for a bandit, depending on the severity of the circumstances. (3) 20 yuan reward for a complete rifle. 40 yuan each for a complete wooden shell pistol. 20 yuan reward for a complete pistol of any type. 60 yuan reward for a complete hand-held machine gun. 5 yuan reward for every hundred rounds of ammunition. Anyone who knowingly conceals and fails to report will be severely punished once discovered.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Joint Transportation: Centered in Haimen</p>
<p>The Haifu transport ship of the German Lihua Company and the Meida ship of the Portuguese Meida Shipping Company have established a joint transportation method, with Haimen in Zhejiang as the central location. That is, the goods and passengers transported from Shanghai by the Haifu Wheel and the goods and passengers transported from Ningbo by the Meida Wheel connect with each other in Haimen, which is very convenient. It is now reported that the Haifu Wheel will depart from Shanghai at noon today, and the Meida Wheel is also scheduled to depart from Ningbo on the same day. They can arrive in Haimen on the same day and implement joint transportation. It is truly good news for Shanghai-Ningbo passengers.</p>
<h3>After Hata Shunroku is Dismissed, Yamada Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After Hata Shunroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, was dismissed and returned to Japan, the Japanese Army Headquarters in Tokyo announced the appointment of Lieutenant General Yamada Otozo to succeed him. According to news obtained by a reporter from the Kuai News Agency, Yamada arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd to take office.</p>
<h3>Youth Federation Urges Fellow Countrymen, Issues Proclamation to People of All Circles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Federation issued a proclamation to people of all circles yesterday. The original text is very long, but the main points are to encourage fellow countrymen in the city in five aspects: (1) Consolidate the anti-Japanese national united front. (2) Eliminate traitors and all wavering elements. (3) Promote the one-yuan debt repayment campaign. (4) Boycott Japanese goods. (5) Support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<h3>Ning-Shao Martial Law Headquarters Ordered to be Abolished; Yin County Defense Command Simultaneously Ended</h3>
<p>The Ningbo City Defense Command was ordered to establish the Ning-Shao Martial Law Headquarters in September of the previous year, with the city defense commander concurrently serving as the martial law commander. Now, the headquarters has been ordered by Commander Gu of the 3rd War Zone via telegram, stating that since Shao has already established a garrison headquarters, the Ning-Shao Martial Law Headquarters is unnecessary and should be abolished immediately. After receiving the order, Commander Guo has abolished the Ning-Shao Martial Law Headquarters. As for the subordinate Yin County Defense Command in the Ning-Shao Martial Law Zone, it was simultaneously closed down. The joint military police inspection team is responsible for inspecting the ports. Liu Zhichu serves concurrently as the team leader, with Li Xiaoxiong, Chuan Jiannan, and others serving as inspectors.</p>
<h3>Telegram Congratulates Ma Xiangbo on his Centennial Birthday</h3>
<p>The first day of the 28th year of the Republic of China coincides with the centennial birthday of Mr. Ma Xiangbo. The Zhang's Chinese Studies Training Association, with Mr. Ma as its chairman, sent a telegram of congratulations, which reads: "To Mr. Ma Xiangbo, on the auspicious beginning of the new year and the joyous occasion of your centennial birthday. May you cultivate yourself in health and wisdom, and may your venerable age continue to enlighten. May you enjoy longevity alongside our nation, a hope shared by all. We, your colleagues, are far away and unable to pay our respects in person. We sincerely hope that you will find peace and limitless joy, and offer our most diligent prayers. We respectfully send this message of celebration. The Zhang's Chinese Studies Training Association, respectfully."</p>
<h3>American Wireless Radio Company Continues Operations; US Federal Communications Commission Opposes Japanese Supervision</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that yesterday afternoon (the 4th), according to information from a private source in Washington, D.C., any attempt to "supervise" or inspect telegrams sent by the Shanghai office of the Global Wireless Radio Company will be opposed by the US Federal Communications Commission. However, the Japanese protest against the company sending telegrams in Shanghai, and what action the State Department will take, is another matter. The local Japanese authorities in this port lodged an oral protest with the US Consul General in Shanghai last week regarding the Global Company sending telegrams, and submitted a written protest two days ago. After receiving the Japanese protest, US Consul General Gauss soon forwarded it to Washington. The US Federal Communications Commission received information about this move yesterday and is now studying this report with the State Department. According to news received in this port yesterday, the FCC has indicated that it intends to maintain the company's current status. At the same time, the Shanghai Global Company is also continuing operations.</p>
<h3>Lake District Groups Commemorate Wang Yiting; Held on the 15th</h3>
<p>The Lake Society in this city, in order to commemorate the late Mr. Wang Yiting, a native of the Lake District, together with fellow villagers engaged in occupational charities,</p>
<h3>Severe Disaster in Northern Jiangsu; Cultivable Land Turned into Swamps; 1.5 Million Destitute Refugees</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that yesterday (the 4th), according to a representative of the Northern Jiangsu International Relief Committee, if funds cannot be obtained immediately to engage in relief work in Northern Jiangsu, then the 1.5 million destitute refugees in that area will inevitably suffer from hunger and cold in the next two months. According to the committee's report, there are currently a total of 2,855,425 destitute refugees in the area. The committee needs funds of 1,492,500 yuan to support these refugees until the end of February, so that they can get through the</p>
<p>Spring Season Without Harvest</p>
<p>Because almost all of the cultivable land in the area has now turned into swamps. As of the end of last year, the committee had launched a large-scale relief program in the area and raised no less than 850,000 yuan, including 200,000 yuan from public donations, 300,000 yuan promised by the Jiangsu Refugee Relief Committee, 100,000 yuan from the International Red Cross, and 20,000 yuan pledged by the International Relief Committee itself. The homes of the refugees have now been destroyed by the war or</p>
<p>Floods Throughout the Province</p>
<p>Most of them rely on relief agencies to provide shelter. In addition to running porridge distribution stations, the committee also distributes cash to the destitute, with adults receiving one yuan per month and children receiving five jiao each. It is estimated that it will cost 150,000 yuan to maintain the porridge distribution stations over the winter. When spring comes, the committee plans to oversee the excavation of two rivers in Jiangsu Province, connecting the Grand Canal with the Yellow Sea, and employ these refugees to work. According to experts,</p>
<p>Excavating Two Rivers</p>
<p>In addition to employing refugees and providing them with work, it will also help alleviate the flooding situation in Jiangsu Province, because most of the floods in Jiangsu Province are caused by the flooding of lakes and rivers. Excavating new channels to the sea can reduce the possibility of flooding. It is hoped that all sectors will generously donate. Educational groups are organizing the "Wang Yiting Memorial Meeting Preparatory Office", and have publicly elected Pan Shesheng as the director of the preparatory office, and Shen Lianfang and Yan Junxuan as deputy directors. The office has established four groups: documentation, administration, public relations, and design, with Wu Dongmai, Shen Tianxin, Zhao Sichen, and Ling Songru serving as the directors of each group. They are actively preparing for the memorial service, which is scheduled to be held at the Lake Society at 2:00 PM on the 15th of this month, to express their condolences. All fellow villagers from the Lake District are welcome to attend. Any condolences can be sent in advance to the Lake Society at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road, where they will be forwarded to the memorial meeting preparatory office.</p>
<h3>Export Cargo Waybills Must be Filled Out in Detail: Proclamation by the Zhejiang Customs</h3>

For goods such as paper, tin foil, and medicinal materials, the following points must be filled out in detail: "Paper" (grade (superior, decisive, inferior) and the Chinese name of the pattern); "Tin foil" (whether the entire surface has tin or half of the surface has tin); "Medicinal materials" (grade one, two, three, four, etc., or Chinese name of the pattern). Waybills filled out without following the above methods will be rejected. The Customs will not be responsible for any delays caused by this.

<h3>After the New Year Holiday, Silver and Money Shops Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>After settling the annual accounts for the 27th year, silver and money shops opened for business yesterday after the New Year holiday. Money shops and other businesses are preparing to carry out the final settlement, scheduled for February 18th. The Money Shop Association will submit all preparatory matters before and after the final settlement to the Executive Committee for decision. Reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that since the outbreak of the war, the banking industry has followed the financial stability measures stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, implementing austerity and preparing itself fully. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. All banks have been able to make a profit after the final settlement. The business policy for this year is to follow the past method, but to maximize lending for domestic goods businesses and assist the government in developing the southwest and completing construction.</p>
<h3>Banking Association Studies Rules for Renting Safe Deposit Boxes: In Order to Serve as a Reference for Revising the Rules; Hope Fellow Industries Will Provide as Many Opinions as Possible</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai City Safe Deposit Box Rental Rules" were completely discussed and finalized by the Safe Deposit Box Business Research Association in the second year of the Republic of China. After being unanimously adopted by various banks, several years have passed. Now various banks and trust companies believe that the nature of the safe deposit box business is very important. Recently, the number of banks and trust companies concurrently operating this business has increased daily, and the business has become increasingly complex. The original twenty-two rental rules, if not revised or supplemented, are insufficient to meet the current needs. Therefore, the Safe Deposit Box Business Research Association decided to revise these rules. At the same time, in order to expand the organization, the Banking Association's Practical Research Association organized a safe deposit box team to undertake this discussion. This case has been discussed many times. After complete discussion and results are obtained, it will be provided to each bank for reference. If any fellow industry members have opinions on these safe deposit box rental rules, it is hoped that they will be provided at any time to facilitate convening a discussion. Now, Articles 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 17, and 19 have been decided upon as a result of discussion. The remaining articles are still under discussion and research.</p>
<h3>Statistics on the Number of Refugees in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Public Works Department on the 4th of this month, there are 71 refugee shelters inspected by the department, accommodating a total of 52,843 refugees.</p>

<h3>Japan's Excessive Issuance of Banknotes Reaches Unprecedented High Record; Exceeds the Maximum Limit of Gold Reserves; Totals a Huge 470 Million</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that in the last few days of the end of last year, the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan reached an unprecedented high record. As of December 27th of last year, the banknotes issued by the bank had reached 2,677,878,000 Japanese yen, exceeding the amount of banknotes in circulation during the Japanese economic crisis in 1927. This number is 476,591,000 Japanese yen greater than the legal maximum amount that the Bank of Japan is allowed to issue under the current Japanese banking laws, based on its gold reserves. The Bank of Japan's excessive issuance of banknotes exceeded this limit, disregarding the legal restrictions on its activities, and not hesitating to violate the law by excessively issuing banknotes without legal gold reserves.</p>
<h3>Progress in the Sale of Chinese Tea; Hong Kong and Shanghai Sales Share the Market Equally</h3>
<p>Tea is a specialty of our country, with a large amount exported every year. After the war, domestic and foreign sales were changed to be implemented and controlled by the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission, and production and sales both increased. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is promoting tea planting in the border provinces, designating tea-producing areas and implementing it separately. The following is a detailed account of the changes in the tea sales and export trade after the war:</p>
<p>Post-War Sales Completely Controlled</p>
<p>Chinese tea's foreign trade was previously handled by foreign firms and tea houses, and the tea needed by foreign tea houses was purchased by personnel sent to the mountains to collect it when the new tea came on the market, and then transported to Shanghai for sale. Although the provincial governments of Anhui and Jiangxi had once controlled the sale of black tea before the war, transporting it from the producing areas to Shanghai for trading, after the outbreak of the war, the Trade Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Finance immediately implemented control over the domestic and foreign sales of black and green tea nationwide. The Fuhua Trading Company was established to purchase tea from all over the country and sell it directly abroad, eliminating various malpractices before the war, benefiting tea farmers, and developing foreign sales with remarkable results.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Shanghai Share the Market Equally</p>
<p>The Trade Adjustment Committee's implementation of tea sales control initially stipulated that all black and green tea must be concentrated in Hong Kong for trading. Later, at the request of the Shanghai Foreign Tea House Association, in order to maintain the business of each tea house, the Trade Commission assessed grades A and B, stipulating that Grade A must be transported to Hong Kong, and Grade B was allowed to be settled and transported to Shanghai, where tea houses were free to trade with foreign firms. Therefore, according to customs statistics, after the implementation of control, the total export volume in Shanghai from January to November this year reached 13,037,257 yuan, and the total export volume in Hong Kong from January to September was 11,216,747 yuan, which can be said that Hong Kong and Shanghai share the market equally.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Changes in Domestic and Foreign Transactions</p>
<p>After the Mo Aunts Trade Adjustment Committee implemented the control of tea sales, Fuhua Trading Company immediately opened a trading floor in Hong Kong. Because it was difficult for all the black and green tea merchants with stores in Shanghai to move immediately, they sent one representative to Hong Kong, specializing in weighing and collecting money. If foreign firms needed to purchase goods, they could trade with Fuhua Company, which was the most powerful tea agency. As for Grade B tea transported to Shanghai, it was mostly concentrated in Wenzhou. In order to facilitate the settlement and sale of foreign exchange and handle transportation and sales, foreign tea houses in Shanghai specially established a joint office in Wenzhou to manage everything. After Grade B tea was transported to Shanghai, foreign firms could trade with each foreign tea house as usual.</p>
<p>Better Production, Increased Sales</p>
<p>This year's tea production in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui and other provinces has been good. In previous years, the output of Keemun black tea and Ningzhou black tea was no more than 80,000 boxes. This year, Fuhua Company purchased and transported 118,000 boxes to Hong Kong. In the past, the annual output of Pingshui green tea was 200,000 boxes, but this year it has also increased to 250,000 boxes. In terms of foreign sales, the majority of black and green tea controlled by Fuhua Company was mainly purchased by the Soviet Union, followed by the United Kingdom, and then the United States. Germany also purchased some. After the implementation of control, foreign sales of tea strive to improve and are able to cater to the tastes of Europeans and Americans, so the amount of foreign sales has increased compared to the past.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Fourth-Term Charity Lottery Relief Funds Announced; Actual Sales of 167,000 Yuan; 30% of the Total Allocated to Relief</h3>
<p>The fourth term of the French charity lottery for refugee relief sold an actual number of 33,400 tickets, each sold for five yuan, totaling 167,000 yuan in national currency. Thirty percent of this amount, or 50,100 yuan, should be allocated for relief funds. Yesterday, Father Rao and other members of the lottery allocation committee held a meeting to discuss the principles of allocation. It was decided that 10% would be allocated as overseas Chinese charity relief funds and 90% would be allocated to Chinese refugee relief. It was subsequently decided to allocate 5,010 yuan to various Western charity organizations for overseas Chinese relief expenses, 30,090 yuan to the Nanshi Refugee Relief Committee for refugee relief expenses, and 15,000 yuan to the Shanghai Refugee Association for refugee relief expenses. The total allocation of 50,100 yuan has been separately allocated to each charity for verification.

There are a total of 5,830 prizes, with the top prize being 50,000 yuan. Each strip is worth 10,000 yuan. If the number of sales is insufficient, it is guaranteed that each strip will receive 7,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Mine Ash Association Donates to Relief Efforts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mine Ash Industry Association believes that there are many refugees in Shanghai and that it is difficult to provide them with food and clothing. It has repeatedly approved the Refugee Relief Association's request to raise funds for relief expenses. The industry has joined forces with the operators of the lime transportation business to decide to hold a business donation. From this month, a donation of one cent per dan of lime will be donated to the Refugee Relief Fund, and it will be tentatively implemented for six months. Currently, the leaders of the two industries, Ma Shaoquan, Lu Fusheng, Li Zhongxiang, and others, are discussing the handling procedures with various colleagues, and they are about to be completed. They will report to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association for filing.</p>
<p>Jade Jewelry Industry Adopts Refugees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jade Jewelry Industry Association is enthusiastic about relief work. Since the Association's Citizen Group initiated the refugee adoption movement, it has carried out fundraising from various companies and individuals in the industry. It has raised a total of 3,072 yuan in national currency, which was sent to the Association's Citizen Group Fundraising Committee yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Citizen Group Schedules Regular Meetings</p>
<p>The Refugee Association's Citizen Group Fundraising Committee decided to broadcast fundraising and adopt refugees, and all parties enthusiastically participated. In addition to continuing to send personnel to collect donations from all walks of life, it also scheduled a regular committee meeting on January 9 (Monday) to organize and announce the broadcast donations, and will continue to promote the work of the fundraising team.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Relief Association Saves Refugees Through Paintings</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Relief Association, in order to raise funds for the refugee children's education and nursing home, specially borrowed the building in the Shanghai New Market on Jing'an Temple Road as a venue for a painting exhibition. There are more than a thousand pieces of ancient and modern works, most of them framed, and they are changed and displayed every day. The prices are particularly low. People who love calligraphy and painting should not miss this opportunity. If you buy them as gifts, you will feel elegant and precious. It's a win-win situation and a gospel for the refugee children.</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association Exhibits Paintings</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Jinrong's son, Yuan Tao, is participating in the preparation of a calligraphy and painting exhibition in the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association Hall on Yu Qiaqing Road. It will be exhibited for three days from January 10 to the evening of the 12th. Ms. Zhou Jie, Ms. Chen Moyin, and Ms. Wang Ruiquan are invited to display their usual collections of fine works in this place. All the proceeds from the sales, after deducting the cost of paper and ink, will be allocated to help refugees.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant Ships Attacked: Actually Attempting to Benefit Guerillas; Intending to Pay a Monthly Special Fee; But Rejected by All Armies in Stern Terms</h3>
<p>The Japanese Qing Shipping Company, since the commercial ships Huadong and Dexin, which operated on the blockade line ports in November last year, were intercepted by guerrillas at Yanglinkou and Changyinsha respectively, suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the company is particularly vigilant. Whenever each ship passes through the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it does not dare to fly the Japanese flag to avoid being noticed. At the same time, the ship also requested the Japanese military headquarters to send additional Japanese troops to be on guard to prevent accidents, and the inspection of merchants and passengers was extremely strict, causing trouble for merchants and passengers to load goods. In addition, the Japanese soldiers escorting the ship sometimes committed acts of drunkenness and violence, which the merchants and passengers complained about. In the event of an interception by guerrillas, both goods and lives would be difficult to protect, so cargo transportation has declined to a great extent. Although it superficially implements control, the result is that not only can the ideal not be achieved, but there is also the possibility of increasing danger at any time. Based on these reasons, the Japanese Qing Company actually came up with a whimsical idea to win over customs brokers and transshipment companies to help them clear the way with the guerrillas in various ports along the river, intending to subsidize them with a certain amount each month or each shift as a special fee. However, it is understood that the Japanese Qing Company's attempt has been sternly rejected by guerrillas in various places.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Postal Administration Approved to Move Back to Hangzhou; Lishui to Be Re-designated as an Office</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Postal Administration, which retreated from Hangzhou to Jinhua in eastern Zhejiang a few years ago and then moved to Lishui to operate, is now permitted to move back to Hangzhou. This is because various branches in Hangzhou and post offices along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line, such as Jiaxing, Jiashan, Xiashi, Wangdian, etc., have gradually resumed operations. However, it has been inconvenient for these post offices to contact the Zhejiang General Administration for business. Therefore, Ke Deng, the Director of the Zhejiang Postal Administration, submitted a request to the Kunming Postal General Administration, seeking permission to move back to Hangzhou. According to a message from the Zhejiang Postal Administration's Shanghai office, the order from the Kunming Postal General Administration has been received, approving the relocation back to Hangzhou for normal operations. However, the Lishui office will be re-designated as an office. The relocation date has not yet been decided. It is reported that some postal staff and important documents have already been shipped from Lishui and will arrive in Shanghai soon for transfer to Hangzhou. The plan to relocate to Ningbo has now been abandoned.</p>
<h3>Passengers Traveling to Hong Kong Must Be Vaccinated Against Smallpox</h3>
<p>No Need for Further Injections: According to Changxing Shipping Company on Beijing Road Bund, passengers traveling to Hong Kong previously had to receive vaccinations and smallpox vaccinations. The company has now received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that passengers traveling to Hong Kong now only need to be vaccinated against smallpox and no longer need vaccinations.</p>

<p>The twelve bandits arrested by the British Concession Police and the Japanese army in the Dunxin Road area of ​​western Shanghai the day before yesterday were taken away by Japanese vehicles. After the Public Concession Police requested extradition, they were transferred to the Central Police Station at about 4 pm yesterday.</p>
<p>Between 3 and 4 pm yesterday, a large number of detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station, together with members of the reserve team, arrested two Chinese suspects in a thatched shed in Caojiadu and seized a hand grenade. The detectives led by Detective Hill also arrested seven accomplices in a house on Robert Road. All the criminals were detained by the Japanese side. It is believed that these people are related to many armed robbery cases in the western district, or have some connection with the criminals arrested in Fahua Town on Wednesday.</p>
<p>According to the "China Press", the gangsters in the western district are rampant. The personnel of the Public Concession Police Department are working tirelessly day and night to track down these gangsters. Yesterday (the 4th), in the afternoon, six men and three women were arrested in a thatched house 200 yards away from Columbia Road. During the arrest, the two sides opened fire fiercely, but no one was injured. The gangsters also threw two or three pistols into the river. By evening, the Police Department had recovered one of them, which was a pistol taken from the police by the gangsters.</p>
<p>Automatic Pistol</p>
<p>One of those arrested was a suspect who was seriously injured twice near Dunxin Road on Monday night, with bullet wounds on his head and chest. He was sent to the Police Hospital last night and is still in critical condition. In addition, three more gangsters were arrested in the concession, all of whom were men. Only these three and the injured suspect were detained by the Police Department last night, because the Japanese authorities refused to extradite the other gangsters. The reason for this attitude of the Japanese side is unknown as of late last night. The Municipal Council believes that the detention of five men and three women by the Japanese military police has made the investigation</p>
<p>Seriously hindered</p>
<p>And made the Police Department lose the opportunity to continue arresting important gangsters. It is strongly suspected that those arrested also participated in the gang that robbed foreigners and Chinese in cars on Columbia Road on Danzhou.

Shortly after noon yesterday, it was learned that a gangster who was injured in the shootout with the police outside Dunxin Road on Monday was hiding in a secret location outside the concession, being taken care of by his gangsters. The location of his hiding place was in Fahua Town, 200 yards west of Columbia Road, not far from the place where British and American expatriates were robbed of money and jewelry on the night of December 28. Detectives and reserve police officers from the General Police Station,</p>
<p>Jointly with the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Military police officers from the Military Police Department went to the town. The gangster's den was in a thatched house next to Fahua Hong (transliteration), which was not easy to find. When about 30 detectives approached the thatched house, the gangsters inside opened fire fiercely from inside. The detectives immediately returned fire. The gangsters, knowing that they were outnumbered and surrounded, threw two or three pistols into the sewer and surrendered. Both sides fired many shots, but apparently no one was hit. The detectives then approached the thatched house and arrested the gangsters inside, along with the one who was injured in the shootout outside Dunxin Road on Monday. A total of six men and three women, plus the three arrested in the concession, counted as suspects.</p>
<p>A total of twelve</p>
<p>, three of whom were questioned in the Police Station last night about their involvement in which crimes. The fourth was lying in the Police Hospital and was still in critical condition. Although the rest were needed by the Police Department, they were in the hands of the Japanese side. In the afternoon yesterday, the work of recovering the abandoned guns began immediately. After a long time, a gun was found in the mud at dusk, a .38 caliber special type. It was identified as the gun lost by the Police Department.</p>
<h3>Das Case: Criminals Sentenced; Cook Receives One and a Half Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Guo Xingwu, the owner of Yuantai Soil Company in Tianjin, concealed 153 pounds of opium in the wheels of a ship and brought it to Shanghai on December 11 last year. He entrusted Meng Yuebo, the owner of Xieyi Fruit Shop at No. 701 Jiujiang Road, to sell it on his behalf. Meng then entrusted his apprentice Qian Yaoting to pick up the goods at the 16th Pier and transport them to the intersection of Sichuan Road and Guangdong Road in a rickshaw. Qian's brother Yaoliang, in collusion with Qian Yongchang and others, intercepted the goods. Later, due to infighting, they were discovered by Sun Wenxi, a Chinese detective from the Chengdu Road Police Station, and Detective Xu Dezhong. Qian Yongchang, Zhou Deming, Zhou Wangshi, Qian Yaoliang, Meng Yuebo, and others, along with the opium, were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin ascended to the second criminal court and announced the verdict: Meng Yuebo was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment and two years of deprivation of civil rights for helping others sell opium. Wang Weilan was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for the same crime. Qian Yaoliang was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for joint encroachment.

<h3>Buddhist Scoundrel Sentenced for Extortion</h3>
<p>Xu Shengfa, a woman from Funing, Jiangbei, who lives at No. 30 Carter Road, Xinzha, is a devout Buddhist. Therefore, she practices Buddhism with hair in the nearby Tongshantang. Xu once worked as a priest in the Xifang Zen Temple in Zhabei two years ago, and met Shao Shijin, a Jiangbei native who was a temple worker. Unexpectedly, Shao had ulterior motives and repeatedly used fraudulent means to extort money from Xu. Recently, Shao wanted to extort a large sum of money from Xu but failed. Therefore, he discussed with Miao Feng, a monk from Guanyintang at No. 75 Wengen Road, and the gangster Yao Baojin, wanting to find a way to slander her. On the 26th of last month, Xu Shengfa and her sister-in-law Xu Zhangshi were passing by the intersection of Aven Avenue and Changsha Road. Shao Shijin took the opportunity to insult her, intending to extort 1,800 yuan. The case was reported by Xu and the police were dispatched to arrest Shao and Miao Feng, and they were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the court continued to interrogate them. The police lawyer, Shu Zhishan, stated the investigation situation during the change of date. Judge Fu questioned the two defendants clearly and sentenced Shao Baojin to one year and six months of imprisonment for threatening to make people hand over property but failing, and Miao Feng to one year of imprisonment. A fake contract was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Huge Amount of Morphine Shipped from Tianjin; Handler Steals from His Employer; Distributor Negotiates Compensation; False Accusation Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>Li Fuqi, a native of Yong, owns a large amount of money and is engaged in the drug business in Tianjin. He divides a huge amount of the drug morphine into rubber bags that are about one foot long and one inch wide. Each bag weighs from more than ten taels to dozens of taels. He entrusted Lou Fuchang, a fellow villager who is the head of the Hailike Foreign Wheel, to bring them to Shanghai and deliver them to Gu Pingyang, a native of Yong who lives in a pavilion room at No. 83 Baliaoqiao Street, French Concession, for sale. Lou arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and only delivered four rubber bags of morphine to Gu Pingyang.</p>
<p>Eight Bags Missing</p>
<p>Gu pursued him, and Lou claimed that he had lost them on the way. In fact, Lou had swallowed them. Gu negotiated compensation with Lou. The dispute lasted for two days and nights. The night before, Gu invited Lou to the Da Hu Hotel on Aiduya Road to open room 404 to negotiate compensation. Lou went with his wife, Zhang. Because he had no words to unload the funds, he asked for 8,000 yuan in compensation. He only agreed to issue a loan note for 1,200 yuan. At 6 am yesterday morning, Lou's wife, Zhang, reported to the Public Police Station, saying that her husband, Lou Fuchang, had been cornered in</p>
<p>Da Hu Hotel</p>
<p>Room 404 was being torn down. Because the Da Hu Hotel was in the French Concession, the police notified the French police and dispatched detectives Jiang Changwen and Gao Meiyan, and police officer Wang Changchun, to rush to room 404 of the Da Hu Hotel. At that time, Lou Fuchang had already escaped on the pretext of going to the toilet. Only Gu Pingyang and six accomplices from Yong, Zhang Tinghua, Qian Kangsheng, Wang Ayuan, Cao Hongxing, and Yu Abiao, who were helping Gu monitor Lou, were arrested. After learning that it was due to the shortage of morphine sold,</p>
<p>Negotiating Compensation</p>
<p>The detectives then went to Gu Pingyang's residence and copied out four rubber bags of morphine, totaling 900 grams, and brought them back to the police station together with the informant Lou Zhang. Yesterday afternoon, the six criminals, Gu Zhangqian, Cao Wangyu, were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated them. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer representing the administrative authorities of the French Concession, stated the case and requested a change of date for further investigation. Then, the detectives reported the process of arresting the defendants. The court verified the report and questioned the defendants once. They were instructed to change the date for another hearing on the 14th. The defendants were sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>Large Fire on North Shanxi Road Last Night Kills Three Lives Destroys Several Houses and Injures Eight Men and Women</h3>
<p>The house at No. 444 North Shanxi Road was rented by Niu Huaijin from Anhui. The downstairs was rented to Qinghe Rice Shop. Niu himself lived on the third floor. At 3:15 yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen of the house. Because it was late at night, the discovery was delayed, causing the fire to spread immediately. After receiving the report, the Huisi Police Station immediately dispatched Detective Fang Qingyun and Police Officer Zhao Ziduo to maintain order. They immediately notified the fire brigade to drive to the scene to put out the fire. However, the wind was very strong at the time, so it was difficult to extinguish the fire for a while. Despite the efforts to put out the fire, the result was the destruction of several houses. The houses destroyed were the overpass buildings at Nos. 438, 440, 442, 444, and 446 at the intersection of Zhaoyuanli, North Shanxi Road, all of which were destroyed. Because it was late at night, many people were unable to escape, resulting in three deaths and eight injuries. After investigation by the police officers, the deceased were identified as Hu Fusheng (32 years old, from Anhui) and his two-year-old son Hu Jindi, and Zhang Yuzhen (49 years old) who lived in the rear building on the third floor. The names of the injured were Niu Huaijin (42 years old, from Anhui), Niu Tangshi (45 years old, from Changzhou), Ni Futang (42 years old, from Shaoxing), Ni Tianshi (32 years old, from Shaoxing), Xu Wangshi (23 years old, from Shaoxing), Shi Xizheng (56 years old, from Haimen), Hu Jianheng (10 years old, from Anhui), and Chen (44 years old, from Shaoxing). The police officers sent the deceased to the mortuary for examination and sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. They also conducted a more detailed investigation into the cause of the fire. The police station reported to the First Special District Court and appointed a prosecutor to go to the mortuary to examine the bodies, confirming that they died from burns suffered before death. They ordered that coffins be provided for burial.</p>
<h3>Fake Police Station on Daxi Road Closed by British Army</h3>
<p>The branch office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which used to be located at the east side of the intersection of Daxi Road and Columbia Road, which was built beyond the concession in western Shanghai, was dissolved after the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the retreat of the Chinese army to the west. Later, a fake "police station" of the "Great Way Municipal Government" was established, and a fake "patrol chief" sent by the Xujiahui fake "police station" led more than ten fake "police" to guard the area. Recently, due to the rampant bandits in western Shanghai, the Public Concession Police Department sealed off the traffic in the area for the sake of protecting the security of the concession. Unexpectedly, British troops suddenly arrived at about 9 am yesterday and sealed the doors and windows of the fake branch office with barbed wire, and posted a note on the door saying "This house is closed by order of the British Army." In the afternoon, several senior Japanese officials accompanied several fake "police officers" to inspect the site, and the debris piled up at the door was not moved.</p>
<h3>Huang Jinrong Temple Director</h3>
<p>The Yimiao Square run by Wan Molin and others was suspected of being a false loan. The Shanghai Yimiao Board of Directors, after obtaining the opinion of Director Du Yuesheng, held a meeting to resolve to oppose it. On the one hand, Director Huang Jinrong was asked to represent the association in his personal capacity to earnestly persuade Wan Molin and others to change the name and ban the sculpting of city gods. At noon yesterday, the Board of Directors held a temporary board meeting at Huang's residence on McGao Baolu Road. Directors Qin Yanqi, Huang Jinrong, Huang Hanzhi, Mao Zijian, Yao Huiquan, secretaries Lu Jinlin, Lu Baorong, Wang Zigang, director Huo Xueming, and attendees Fan Huichun and Jin Liren were present. First, Huang Jinrong reported on the progress of the negotiations, and then introduced Wan Yimolin, saying that the "Yimiao Market" had agreed to change its name to "Shanghai Public Concession Yimiao Market" to show that it was different from the official Yimiao Market in the city. The market will also publish a notice to disclose the origin of its renaming. The Board of Directors believed that the purpose of the negotiations had been achieved and approved the plan. However, it was absolutely forbidden to sculpt another city god to confuse the public and comply with the intentions of Director Du's letter. After the meeting, Director Huang hosted a banquet until 3 pm.</p>
<h3>Yuan San Denies Participating in Fake City Bank</h3>
<p>This newspaper previously reported that Gu Disan would take the post of manager of the fake "City Bank". According to sources close to Gu, Gu is now nearly 70 years old and has been cut off from contact with the outside world for a long time. In addition, he has been living at home in recent years and is content. The statement that he will take the post of manager of the City Bank is not true and he has no intention of doing so. The report in the newspaper is probably a rumor.</p>

<h3>Large Gang of Bandits in Jurong County Murders New Fourth Army Paymaster, Brigadier Liang Zuocheng and His Son; Five Bandits Executed; Shanghai Municipal Police Continues to Arrest Suspects; Open Trial Held Yesterday; Supreme Court Orders Further Review</h3>
<p>It is reported that last December, Ye Ting, the commander of the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, had an officer under his command named Liang Zuocheng escorting army pay to Jiangsu Province with soldiers. While passing through Qiaoxiang Village in Jurong County, Liang and his fifteen-year-old son were kidnapped by a large group of bandits armed with weapons. The bandits then murdered them and robbed 327,000 yuan in pay. Subsequently, Commander Ye dispatched a large detachment of soldiers to the village, where they arrested five bandits involved in the case: Da Yuanlin, Chen Youfa, Qiao Detai, Qiao Yikun, and Zhang Bingquan. After interrogation, all were found guilty and executed by firing squad. Last September, Shanghai Municipal Police detective Shang Wu and other Chinese and foreign detectives, continuing their investigation into the case, apprehended five more suspects from Jurong County: Dai Hongfu, Chen Hesheng, Chen Bosheng, Qiao Changjin, and Chen Qiaosheng, at locations including 444 and 459 North Shaanxi Road, and 340 and 349 Shandong Road. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. After questioning, Chen Qiaosheng was found to be uninvolved and was released on bail. Dai Hongfu and the other four were detained for further investigation. (Due to the extreme importance of the case, the police wanted to arrest more gang members, so the hearing was closed to the public and no announcements were made.) It wasn't until yesterday morning that Judge Huang Risheng held an open trial in the Second Criminal Court, questioning Dai Hongfu and the others. The four defendants firmly insisted that they had not participated in the crime and had come to Shanghai to seek refuge last August. Judge Huang questioned the four defendants separately for a long time, but their statements remained consistent, steadfastly denying any involvement. He ordered them remanded in custody, pending review by the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Russian Drunk Blocks Car, Beats Wang Simo; Rickshaw Puller Seriously Injured; Perpetrator Detained Pending Trial; Wang, President of the Second Special District Local Court of This City</h3>
<p>It is reported that on the 1st of this month at noon, Mr. Wang Simo, president of the Second Special District Local Court of this city, attended a banquet hosted by Western friends. At 2:00 PM, he boarded his private car, hospital number 857, driven by Yao Yunfu, a rickshaw puller from Ningbo, to return to his residence at No. 6, Lane 79, Huanlong Road. As the car entered Lane 79 on Huanlong Road, at the entrance of the second alley, three drunken Russians, including one named Ivan Sintsov (transliteration), stood in front of the car, preventing the rickshaw puller Yao Yunfu from getting out. They questioned him harshly and cursed him.</p>
<p>They then punched him violently,</p>
<p>causing injuries. Judge Wang also got out of the car and, speaking in English, questioned Ivan Sintsov, who then punched Wang in the left forehead, shattering his platinum-rimmed glasses. Police officers arrived and arrested the Russian, taking him to the police station for investigation. Yesterday afternoon, he was transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Qiu Huanxing presided over the hearing. Lawyer Fei Xizhen, representing the French Concession authorities, stated the case,</p>
<p>Prosecuting him for assault.</p>
<p>He also noted that the defendant had previously been convicted of assault and sentenced to 60 yuan. The injured rickshaw puller, Yao Yunfu, was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the police due to his serious injuries and was therefore not present in court. Detectives then reported the results of their investigation. Ivan Sintsov, 31 years old, a Russian resident of No. 1331 Yu Yuan Road, testified that on that day, he saw the car</p>
<p>Driving into the alley.</p>
<p>He raised his hand, but the driver not only did not stop but continued forward, so he went forward to hit the driver. The person sitting in the car got out to help the driver and wanted to hit him, so he also punched him, etc. The witnesses, friends of the defendant Trofimnina (transliteration), a Russian, and Pierre (transliteration), a Belgian, testified, largely siding with the defendant. The court reviewed the testimony and ordered the defendant to be detained, with a continued hearing scheduled for the 12th.</p>
<h3>Coal Delivery Leads to Murder; Police File Charges; Suspect Chen Asi Arrested; Autopsy Required for Further Review</h3>
<p>It is reported that at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, Li Jingshi, the Ningbo owner of Jiuda Coal Shop at No. 11 Park Road, instructed his fellow townsman Chen Xiaji, 31 years old and a shop assistant, to deliver one and a half dan of coal to a resident at No. 265, Lane 590, Haining Road. A dispute arose due to a shortage of two jin in the weight, and Chen Asi, a worker from Danyang, and several companions beat him up. After returning to the shop, Chen Xiaji suddenly felt severe abdominal pain around 10:00 PM and was rushed to Baolong Hospital, where he died. The hospital reported the incident to the Shanghai Municipal Police, who sent detectives to arrest Chen Asi and bring him to the police station. The deceased's body was transported to the morgue. Yesterday morning, the suspect Chen was sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Chen Xiaji's body had been inspected by the court's prosecutor and a forensic doctor, who determined that an autopsy was required. He requested a postponement. Judge Huang Risheng questioned Chen Asi briefly and ordered him remanded in custody, with a continued hearing scheduled for another day.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Search; Villager Shot Dead; Several Others Arrested</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that a Japanese military police squad leader was attacked and injured in Caohuo Town, west of Shanghai, Japanese troops have been conducting strict searches of the town's surrounding villages, often late at night or early in the morning. However, these searches have only resulted in fruitless journeys and disturbed residents. Around 3:00 AM the night before last, a large contingent of Japanese soldiers raided Yangjia Port and Caojiazhai, east of the town. They stormed into the home of farmer Cao Xizhang. Cao's daughter-in-law, Ms. Wu, hearing the sudden arrival of Japanese soldiers, hurriedly climbed out of bed in a daze and escaped through the window to hide in a ditch next to a bamboo grove. Unfortunately, she was spotted by the Japanese soldiers, who, without asking any questions, opened fire, killing her with a bullet. By the time the mistake was realized, it was already too late. The Japanese soldiers then arrested several villagers, including Yang Xiaomao and his son, from Yangjia Port and are currently detaining them at the Japanese military headquarters in Longhua for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Concert</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra will hold its twelfth symphony concert of the season at the Lyceum Theatre on Sunday, the 8th of this month, at 5:15 PM. The program includes four pieces, including a symphony. Ticket prices remain the same (two types: $1.10 and $0.55).</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Disregard the Law, Vandalize Tobacco Shop, Assault Police Officer; Arrested and Detained by Police; Will Be Prosecuted in Japanese Consular Court</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, two Japanese men in plain clothes vandalized a part of a certain Xiaobing exchange shop at No. 497 Sichuan Road last night (the 4th) and assaulted a Chinese traffic police officer. A Western police chief from the Central Police Station rushed to the scene and attempted to arrest them, but they resisted. The reported details are as follows: At around 11:20 PM, two Japanese men entered the shop, smashed the glass on the counter, broke the glass on the door to the inner room, and overturned tables and furniture. A traffic police officer attempted to intervene, but the Japanese men attacked him, tearing his coat and pulling off one of the white traffic sleeves. The sleeve was later found, crumpled and worn, in the pocket of one of the Japanese men's coats. When a Western police chief attempted to stop them, the collar of his coat was also slightly torn. After much argument and resistance, the two Japanese men were taken to the Central Police Station in a police van and placed in cells. A Japanese detective learned the details and investigated the situation, and notified the police department of the Japanese consulate. It is reported that the police will prosecute the two Japanese men in the Japanese consular court for intentional damage and assault of a police officer.</p>
<h3>Robbers Steal Truck; Whereabouts Unknown</h3>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 6:10 PM, a vacant truck with registration number 23018 was traveling north on Xinzha Road near Wenzhou Road when four bandits suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two of the bandits, wielding firearms, threatened the driver and ordered him to stop. The driver, seeing that there was no way to avoid it, stopped the truck. The bandits boarded the truck and ordered the driver to turn onto Xinzha Road and drive west. The driver, watched by the bandits, had no choice but to obey. Unexpectedly, at the intersection of Hart Road, the bandits told the driver to stop and pushed him out of the car, then drove off themselves, speeding northwest. The driver, helpless, rushed to the local police station to report the incident. The police immediately ordered detectives to investigate and search for the truck, but as of midnight, the truck had not been found.</p>
<h3>Explanation of "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" [Cessation of Gonorrhea], A Savior for Gonorrhea Patients</h3>
<p>In 1919, Pasulfamide was discovered as a raw medicine, but it was not noticed by others. In 1936, it was found that this raw medicine could treat various diseases caused by hemolytic streptococcus and meningitis bacteria. In May 1937, Reuters (Dr. Rentes), Dr. Deses, and Dr. Colston suddenly issued a surprising report stating that Pasulfamide could treat gonorrhea, with unprecedented bactericidal power and no side effects. It could be used widely and was easily absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and quickly excreted in urine. The medical community paid great attention to this and widely used it. The results were the same as those reported by Reuters. The medical community then embarked on a trend of trying Pasulfamide, and they were proud to publish news about this medicine. Some busybodies even tried to find fault with this medicine, hoping to increase their reputation, but after two or three years of nitpicking, it turned out that this medicine had no harmful effect on the human body when treating gonorrhea. Therefore, its use became more widespread. The results of the trial were consistent with the reports made by Reuters. Reuters reported that (Pasulfamide) treated gonorrhea with a success rate of over 90% in five days, and many cases were cured in two days. Peking Union Medical College has also adopted (Pasulfamide). According to Dr. Chen Kuan, director of the Department of Pharmacology at Peking Union Medical College, this raw medicine, Pasulfamide, is often referred to as "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" (Cessation of Gonorrhea), which he considers very appropriate. This medicine is indeed an unprecedented and effective treatment for gonorrhea and can be widely used. He believes that this medicine is easier to use than 606 for syphilis, because 606 contains a strong toxicity. Syphilis patients cannot use it unless injected by a doctor. However, "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" is different. 606 can only be injected, while "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" can be taken internally and is non-toxic. The discovery of this "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" by the medical community can be said to be a savior for gonorrhea patients. "Xin Le De Neng" is a pill made with "Bai Zhuo Fu Man" as the main agent and supplemented with other carefully selected medicines such as concentrated sandalwood oil and copaiba balsam. It can be used to treat gonorrhea, with fast bactericidal action, great medicinal power, pain relief, bowel cleansing, no toxic substances, no harm to the stomach, fast absorption, and quick excretion. There are two types, for men and women, so that the different physical conditions of men and women are fully considered. It is thorough and safe and is a major invention that will benefit mankind greatly. This new drug "Xin Le De Neng" is exclusively managed by New Star Unlimited Company and is officially released today. The future prospects are very promising.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Dispute in Lafayette New Village; Real Estate Company Applies for Auction; Divorced Wife of Owner Raises Objection; Review Pending Submission of Rent Account</h3>
<p>Chen Dimin, a wealthy businessman from Anhui who once worked as a compradore for a foreign company, lived with Tan Kunfan, a woman from Suzhou, out of love. They later married and had seven or eight children. However, Chen became acquainted with a prostitute named Wu Luo'e and lived with her, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. Chen and Tan's marriage also suffered because of Wu, and two years ago Tan filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court for separation, eventually filing for divorce and seeking 70,000 yuan in alimony. The initial judgment granted the divorce and ordered Chen to pay Tan 20,000 yuan in alimony. The second instance appeal changed the alimony to 15,000 yuan, but the divorce was still granted. The case is currently on appeal to the third instance. When Chen and Tan were in love, they jointly established Lafayette New Village real estate. Chen later mortgaged the property to Hengye Real Estate Company. Now, because of overdue payments, Hengye Company filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court against Chen to recover the mortgage debt. A judgment was issued ordering him to repay 258,000 yuan. The creditor, Hengye Real Estate Company, has applied to the court to execute the auction of Lafayette New Village real estate. Chen and Tan Kunfan have retained lawyers Xue Jiaqi and others to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District against Hengye Real Estate Company and Chen Dimin, raising objections to the execution. Yesterday morning, Judge Ma Yishu opened the Seventh Civil Court to hear the case. The three parties were represented by their lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the Lafayette New Village real estate was built jointly by the plaintiff and the defendant Chen Dimin, each owning one-half. From April 1934 to April 1937, the property was mortgaged to Hengye Real Estate Company, with rents being used to pay off the debt. The monthly rent collected was 3,380 yuan. Based on the past market rent collection, after deducting interest, there should be a remaining balance of over 10,000 yuan. After deducting the mortgage loan, Chen only owes about 210,000 yuan. Because the market rent has increased since the war last year, the remainder would be even greater after deducting interest. However, the lawyer representing the defendant, Hengye Real Estate Company, stated that the total mortgage debt owed was over 280,000 yuan and there was no surplus rent to pay off the debt. Chen Dimin's lawyer also made a statement. The court, noting that the dispute was over the rent account, ordered Hengye Real Estate Company to submit the rent account for review and rescheduled the hearing for the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Student Economic Dormitory Organized by YWCA Ready to Open on the 10th</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Christian Educational Association and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), commissioned by the Shanghai Student Relief Committee, are now managing a student economic dormitory on the 7th and 8th floors of the Wuzhou Building on Fuzhou Road, specifically for male and female students from impoverished families. The boys are managed by the Educational Association, and the girls are managed by the YWCA. Regarding fees, because the dormitory is for relief purposes, students only pay six yuan per month, with the rest subsidized by the Student Relief Committee and the two associations. The dormitory is equipped with beds, chairs, desks, etc., each person having their own. There are also libraries, lounges, bathrooms, washrooms, etc., so that impoverished students can reduce the burden of accommodation expenses while acquiring good living habits. However, because the dormitory is for the relief of impoverished students, the restrictions are somewhat strict. Students applying for accommodation must have a letter of certification from the principal of their school and submit a volunteer form and investigation form. Only after review and approval can they be admitted to the dormitory. Due to limited space, the dormitory cannot accommodate a large number of students. Currently, it only accepts 60 male and female students each. Preparations are now complete, and registration begins today. Move-in is scheduled for the 10th of this month. To request regulations and registration information, contact the Educational Association in Eight Immortals Bridge or the Student Department of the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>

<h3>"Talking Nonsense"</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The phrase "talking nonsense" was originally used by prostitutes to reject requests from patrons. It seems shallow and somewhat incoherent, but its meaning is profound: it contains belittling the other party and despising their intentions, so it is also a synonym for "arrogance" or "dreaming."</p>
<p>Friends who go to prostitutes pay a considerable price to find a certain person. We don't need to investigate their actual intentions. Are they elegant or filthy? At a minimum, they hope to get a smile from the other person, the so-called "buying a smile with a thousand pieces of gold" should be one of the goals. However, some of those prostitutes deliberately show off their value, refusing to smile easily, while others are ashamed and dare not say much, sitting coldly on the side, only answering when asked. Buyers in this situation will naturally feel bored. To achieve the goal of prostitution and harmonize the atmosphere, they have to come up with many exaggerated, ancient, and filthy words to stir the other person's heart and induce a charming smile. Therefore, their attitudes are inevitably frivolous, and their words are inevitably mean. The other party knows that they are being insulted and ridiculed, but due to their status, they cannot quarrel or argue, and can only treat it as a dream and warn them: "Don't talk nonsense!" rejecting them completely.</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai are very smart. They are not only highly absorbent but also very quick to spread things. At the same time, there are too many friends and facts of "talking nonsense," so this sentence quickly became popular in all levels of society.</p>
<p>Now, any excessive demands, exaggerated statements, and unreasonable arguments can be met with the reply: "Don't talk nonsense!"</p>
<p>In fact, there are many friends and facts of "talking nonsense" in general society, and this trend also prevails in the international arena. However, only the shameless, lowly, weak-willed, and confused people will fall for it.</p>
<h3>Scene of the New Year Cake Market</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>During the Christmas season, the New Year cake market had already opened. Once the Gregorian New Year arrived, the New Year cake market seemed to be stimulated and became particularly lively. From the mooncake market to the crab market, and from the crab market to the New Year cake market, metabolism occurs, with each season having its own seasonal foods. Merchants never forget the seasons.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most popular in the New Year cake market is Ningbo New Year cake. Many people who make New Year cakes rent half a storefront, set up a rectangular table, and several cake makers are busy kneading and making Ningbo New Year cakes all day long.</p>
<p>The method for making Ningbo New Year cakes is very simple. Grind glutinous rice with water, steam it, beat it in a stone mortar, knead it until sticky on the table, and then put it in a mold to print into strips of New Year cake. Therefore, in front of every New Year cake stall, there is always a sign that reads "Top Quality Water-Ground New Year Cake."</p>
<p>Although it is only half a storefront, the rent is expensive this year, costing tens of dollars a month. Fortunately, the price of rice is not expensive, so making rice cakes is still a good short-term business. From the winter solstice to the Lunar New Year's Eve, in previous years, the New Year cake market only lasted for 30 to 40 days, but this year, the period from the winter solstice to the Lunar New Year's Eve is a full two months long. The New Year cake market has been extended invisibly. Coupled with the crowding of residents on the isolated island, the sales volume of New Year cakes will inevitably be higher than in previous years, so New Year cake stalls are particularly lively, with one every three steps and one every five steps.</p>
<p>Currently, the market price of New Year cakes is 17 jin per yuan. Although it is only one stall, some people can make several thousand yuan in business during the two-month New Year cake market. The workers who make New Year cakes are not necessarily from Ningbo, with locals accounting for the majority. Each person's salary ranges from over ten yuan to over twenty yuan per month. In addition to New Year cakes, some stalls also sell New Year cake dumplings in the morning. They use steamed cake flour, add some red bean paste and dried fruit to make filling, and knead it into New Year cake dumplings. The business is also not bad.</p>
<p>Not only are there temporary New Year cake stalls, but cake shops are also busy making Ningbo New Year cakes these days. Ningbo New Year cake can be stir-fried with shredded pork as a snack, and it can also be used in cooking. Not only do people from Ningbo love to eat it, but people from all over Shanghai now love to eat it. Therefore, Ningbo New Year cake is available year-round in Shanghai, but it is especially lively during the New Year cake season at the end of the year.</p>
<p>In addition to Ningbo New Year cakes, Suzhou-style and Cantonese-style sugar New Year cakes are also quite popular in Shanghai. Sugar New Year cakes are made with glutinous rice. These days, look at any tea shop, dry goods store, or cake shop on Nanjing Road, and you'll see they are all piled high with sugar New Year cakes, both meat and vegetarian, white sugar and brown sugar, rose-flavored and egg yolk-flavored, lard-flavored and bean paste-flavored, with a wide variety of styles too numerous to list. Guan Sheng Yuan and Tai Kang have also displayed Cantonese-style lard New Year cakes in their windows, and there are also various New Year cake boxes. The four major companies have also opened separate sections to sell New Year cakes.</p>
<p>There are also Gaoqiao New Year cakes, Shaoxing New Year cakes, and many other styles, but they are not as popular as the Ningbo New Year cakes and Suzhou-style and Cantonese-style sugar New Year cakes mentioned above. Facts tell us that New Year cake is a huge expense for the Lunar New Year. And this is not the only huge expense, so we still use the same old words to ask that "every single person on the isolated island should never forget 'disaster relief through thrift' at any time and in any place."</p>
<h3>A World of Terror</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>(IAMTheLaw)</p>
<p>Produced by Columbia, Shown at the Grand Light Theater</p>
<p>To put it simply, it's an old story. This is a film comparable to gMEN. In other words, it is one of the products of the American government's film policy to suppress bandits and stabilize society. Can such a superficial approach really eliminate bandits? Can it really stabilize society? This is a question (my answer is definitely no), but it is a fact that we have seen many similar films under the "Blue Eagle" film policy.</p>
<p>"A World of Terror" tells the story of John, a law professor with an inherently upright character and hatred for evil, and how he sacrifices his vacation to help the government in its work to stabilize society. I like this story. My liking does not lie in how he exerts himself to eliminate thugs – the purpose of the production is to appeal to "law professors with inherently upright characters, asking them to come forward and cooperate with the government to stabilize society." If the location is changed to Shanghai, here and now, if we change our perspective and view it with a spirit of not fearing violence and fighting to the end, it may not be without some significance. Yes, resolutely fighting against the violent is a very good subject. What I like is the screenwriter's creative method of writing from a positive perspective, and John's inherently upright character, determined to move forward bravely and overcome all difficulties. Motivated by such a firm character, and because the author writes about him from a positive perspective, he gives people the courage to fight against the violent. Of course, the producers' purpose was not for us on the "isolated island" at this time and place, and the development of the story inevitably has too many "coincidences," but a play shown in a certain place at a certain time is inseparable from time and space, just like Rock's "Professor of Antiques." The film itself is not a film that insults China, but we will not forget that he starred in the films "Daredevil" and "One Million a Year" which insulted China. We should ask about the producer's purpose of a film, but we should also point out its objective effect. Those with superficial knowledge may think that this is talking about things outside the film, but we firmly believe that this is really "within the scope" of the film.</p>
<p>Now let's turn the topic to the performance aspects of "A World of Terror."</p>
<p>I like the directing of this film. Alexander Hall is very capable of clearly and powerfully controlling the progress of the play. He understands the compilation of the script, so he can uniformly express the center of gravity of the play. I certainly do not agree with the basis of a play being placed on one person, so that the development of the play is due to the development of this character, and the background he is in is instead subordinate to him, but in this play, it cannot be denied that there are its advantages, that is, as I said above, the author positively sculpts (not describes) an upright and firm character, and such a character is what moves us and increases our courage to fight against the violent.</p>
<p>The director's strength is that he fully promotes this advantage: and in the subtle places, such as that Professor John often puts his burning pipe in his pocket, causing the pocket to smoke, and uses dogs to hinder the thugs from stimulating the audience.</p>
<p>The parts that are too "coincidental" are due to the script, such as the thugs breaking into the house, and John happening to go to get a gun. Ferguson's suicide by jumping in front of a car is because his son Paul's "superb legal skills, mature for his age" "human touch" is at play, as the explanation says: "For the sake of maintaining the reputation of his beloved son Paul, the screenwriter must both 'eliminate bandits and stabilize society' for the film policy and 'sacrifice one's relatives for the greater good,' and also maintain the reputation of his beloved son Paul," naturally resigning himself to such a tragic end.</p>
<p>Edward G. Robinson's acting is good, experienced and stable, just like the various films he has acted in before, especially the use of both hands, fully demonstrating his power, and his pronunciation and facial expressions are even better.</p>

<p>In the article "Auspicious Signs of the New Year" by Sang Zijun published on the 2nd, the character "佳" (auspicious) in the title and the text was mistakenly printed as "結" (knot). This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Ballads of North and South</h3>
<p>Yuan Yin: The talents of poets and scholars are stirring in Shanghai. The north of Shanghai is known for its opulence and decadence. Mr. Yan has compiled "Ballads of North Shanghai," describing the scenery of the northern district. Now, a special edition is being published to be shared with the world. Calling Shanghai its home, the city is made of earthly flowers, the moon is a building, singing is solicited at doors, and wine is consumed everywhere until dusk. Yet, it still originates from the city. Since Westerners engaged in commerce, mountains and hills have been transformed, and grand buildings have been erected. Night trees are numbered, spring goods are the focus, economics are discussed, and wandering youths are everywhere. At that time, unemployment was a given, and over the past ten years, the changes have been significant. Those who see through the illusion cannot help but feel sentimental. This poem by Shao Jun is like a record of the pleasure district and the life of courtesans. Written in the early summer of the Bingzi year of Guangxu.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the book "Ballads of North and South" introduces quite a few surnames of female ballad singers, all of whom were important figures in the female ballad singing scene at the time. Volume 4 of "Miscellaneous Records of the Universe" contains an article entitled "Preface to the Western-style Courtesans," which records many names. Here are the names listed:</p>
<p>Jiang Qinlan, Fang Qiu, Chen Chaoyun, Zhou Ai, Chen Daixiang, Chuan Yueqing, Zhou Yueqing, Zhu Lanqing, Zhu Shaoqing, Zhu Rongqing, Zhu Wenqing, Lu Xiuqing, Zhu Suqing, Wang Yixiang, Wu Suqing, Zhu Xueqing, Zhu Yuqing, Wang Baoqing, Huang Aiqing, Jin Youqing, Fang Aiqing, Fang Shaoqing, Xu Peiqing, Huang Baoqing, Ye Xiuqing, Zhu Xiangqing, Zhu Fengjuan, Yu Fengzhen, Zhu Sulan, Zhu Youlan, Zhu Ruilan, Li Peilan, Yuan Yuexian, Chuan Yuexian, Shen Yuechun, Yuan Xuelan, Yuan Yunxian, Wang Youjuan, Wang Shaojuan, Li Qinxian, Zhang Xuezhen, Chen Zhixiang, Chen Yuee, Chen Yuezhen, Chen Yuefang, Li Huifang, Wang Yueqin, Jin Sujuan, Jiang Yuee, Jiang Yuejuan.</p>
<p>The preface involves fifty female ballad singers, which shows how prosperous the "courtesans" were in Shanghai at that time. There were also female ballad singers in Suzhou, but the prosperity was far less than in Shanghai. According to Wang’s research, "The opening of the Shanghai courtesans began with Zhu Sulan. Those who followed Sulan were Zhou Ruixian and Yan Lizhen." This is also sufficient for verification. In addition, what is also worth mentioning is the location of these types of courtesans. According to the "Notes of Touring Shanghai" by the Lean Crane Poet, "They all live in the East He Xing, West He Xing, East Hui Fang, West Hui Fang, East Gong He, West Gong He, Shang Ren Li, Tao Yuan Li, Zhao Fu, Zhao Gui, Ri Xin, Jiu An, Pu Qing, and Tong Qing in the middle of Shi Road, as well as Qing He Fang, Gong Yang Li, Zhao Rong Li, and Gui Xin Li." The area is also very wide, and its main purpose is no longer "literature." (End of this section)</p>
<h3>Twice Passed Qing</h3>
<p>— Bao Tian</p>
<p>Chapter 1: One-Armed Elder Organizes a Free Village, Twin Sisters Reverently Visit the Tombs of Martyrs</p>
<p>Let's talk about the private school established by Zhu Laoyuan. His teaching methods were not in line with the emerging school regulations. He was essentially putting on a one-man show, flailing around without anyone to help him. Later, the county sent an inspector, who naturally found the school neither like a proper school nor like a traditional private school. Of course, this was wrong, and that was wrong. If you were to pick at it, nothing would be right. The inspector believed that elementary school teachers should have some education, so he asked Zhu Laoyuan, "What school are you from?" Zhu Laoyuan widened his eyes and said, "What school am I from? I'm from the school of carrying a hoe and digging mud. I don't want to teach any books. Why do you only open schools in the city and not open elementary schools in the countryside? Are the villagers supposed to be ignorant and not deserve to study? It's easy enough to collect donations from the villagers, with fancy names like education surcharges, but what benefits do the villagers actually get?" The inspector was taken aback by his rebuff and had nothing to say. Later, several villages were merged, and an elementary school was established. However, some people still wanted Zhu Laoyuan to teach the children in the village, but Zhu Laoyuan declined, saying, "I'm not good enough after all. Before, there were no schools near the village, and I saw the children just running around in the fields and cemeteries, with no one to care for them. I felt that it was always beneficial for a person to know a few words, so I took in a few students to teach. But my own knowledge is limited. Now that there is an elementary school, it's better to go to the elementary school. Although it's a bit further away, country children aren't afraid of running." Even though he didn't teach, he still went to the small teahouse. This small teahouse was their gathering place and their place of discussion. It continued until 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and the village was occupied. All the small teahouses and the entire village were burned to the ground. Zhu Laoyuan led a group of young people in the village to form a guerrilla隊, fighting the enemy forces. On one occasion, he led a team of his strong young subordinates, more than forty people, along a certain railway line, intending to cut off the enemy's rear and seize their supplies and weapons. It was a dark and windy night, with some light rain. They had pre-dug up six or seven zhang of the railway track and sent people to ambush on all sides. At a signal, the ambushing forces rose up together, catching the enemy soldiers off guard. However, this time, victory was achieved, but our loyal uncle's country teacher, Zhu Laoyuan, was seriously injured. (5)</p>

<h3>Finance: London Pure Gold Sets New Record High: £7 10s 5d; Local Spot Price Declines Against the Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot silver futures market situation was unpredictable. Generally, the underlying trend initially fell and then rose, eventually falling again. Initially, the London pure gold price repeatedly reached new highs, but it did not arouse the excitement of buyers because the foreign exchange rate tended to be looser. Therefore, the price then declined. Later, the buying interest from the Hong Kong syndicate became stronger, and a certain money exchange business instructed to buy more than 200 taels. At the same time, the securities syndicate also collected a little, causing the price to rise again. In the end, a certain kind of atmosphere was rumored in the market, causing people's hearts to suddenly become fatigued, and the selling atmosphere suddenly became strong. Moreover, the selling intention of a certain gold shop was indeed more eager than others, so the price repeated its downstream movement. However, there were many turns in the middle, but there were no major waves. However, as a result, it only fell by 4 yuan compared to the closing price on Saturday night. People's hearts in all quarters were uncertain, and the transaction was still strong, about 700 taels in the morning and slightly less than 200 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Spot Silver Futures Fall by 4 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar of ten taels initially had strong confidence. Later, it was heard that the underlying trend of the foreign exchange rate tended to be stronger after the opening, causing people's hearts to gradually move downstream. A certain money exchange business called for selling at 2,005 yuan, but those who wanted to buy were all watching from the sidelines. It was not until the price was called down to 1,995 yuan that buyers were seen. First, a certain money exchange business bought on behalf of the Hong Kong syndicate, purchasing 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 1,995 yuan, which was the opening price. Then, it purchased 100 taels from the spot silver futures firm at a price of 94 yuan. During this period, the foreign exchange rate was slightly reported as looser, and the Hong Kong syndicate also stopped buying and watched from the sidelines. The price then fell, with the spot silver futures firm selling 50 taels to another money exchange business at a price of 93 yuan, and another 50 taels to a money exchange business at 91 yuan. The gold shop syndicate sold 50 taels to another money exchange business at a price of 90 yuan. Later, the syndicate took advantage of the low price and entrusted a certain money exchange business to buy on its behalf, purchasing 50 taels each from the spot silver futures firm and the money shop syndicate, both at a price of 90 yuan. At the same price, another money exchange business purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate. After this, there were more buyers, and the price then hovered and rose again. The money exchange business purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 93 yuan. A certain money exchange business then purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 94 yuan. Another money exchange business purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 94 yuan. A certain money exchange business then purchased 50 taels from the gold shop syndicate at a price of 96 yuan. During this period, a certain gold shop suddenly developed a selling intention, selling 50 taels to the securities syndicate at a price of 96 yuan, which was the highest price, and then selling 50 taels to the money exchange business at a price of 94 yuan, and then selling 50 taels to the money exchange business at a price of 95 yuan, and then selling 50 taels to the gold shop syndicate at a price of 93 yuan. The money exchange businesses did 50 taels among themselves at a price of 94 yuan. Finally, the money exchange business purchased 50 taels from the gold shop at a price of 95 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, trading became sparse, and around 2:30 p.m., it was again heard that the foreign exchange rate was looser, so the price trended weakly again. The money exchange businesses did 30 taels among themselves at a price of 93 yuan. After this, supply and demand became even more scarce. Then, after 3:20 p.m., a certain kind of atmosphere suddenly spread in the market, causing the selling wind to become even stronger. A certain gold shop was indeed more eager than others, so the price then broke into the 90-yuan level. A certain gold shop strongly sold more than 100 taels, all at a price of 88 yuan, all of which were taken in by a certain money exchange business on behalf of foreign banks. The final closing price for the evening was still 1,988 yuan, a drop of 4 yuan compared to the closing price before the holiday on Saturday. The full-day difference was 8 yuan. The selling price of the spot silver futures firm's brand gold was 1,995 yuan, and the purchase price was 1,988 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were no trades opened.</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate of Ornament Gold Does Not Move</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold jewelry in gold shops remains unchanged. The old Qingyun and other shops of the Great Guild still suspend the original price of 202 yuan, and the new shops suspend 200 yuan and call in 198 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Rises Sharply and Unceasingly</p>
<p>London, 4th: The price of English pure gold continued to rise sharply, with each ounce unexpectedly rising by another 4 and a half pence, breaking the high of 7 pounds 10 shillings on November 26 of last year, and setting a new high of 7 pounds 10 shillings 5 pence. It was found that it rose a total of 11 and a half pence during the holiday, causing the Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold to also rise to 1,227 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold also rose sharply by 1 cent and 1 li, reaching 2 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen 7 li. The Shanghai standard bid gold price also rose by 7 yuan and 8 jiao, reaching 1,223 yuan and 2 jiao, all of which were new highs that had never been reached since the market opened.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Plummet Following the Price of Gold</h3>
<p>After the silver and money businesses completed the year-end closing of accounts and the New Year's Day holiday, they opened for business yesterday. During the holiday period, the price of English pure gold rose by a total of 11 pence and a half, and the exchange rates of English and American currencies fell by a total of 1 point 83125. The English and American exchange rates were frequently filled with foreign wires, the banks' absorption was not smooth, and the market price was loose and unstable. The trend was firm, and the opening was a bright spot, but before long, a reaction suddenly arose, and retail investors rose one after another to leave the market, plummeting step by step. The market became increasingly weak, and foreign currencies also followed the trend and loosened. The guild transactions were not opened. Yesterday's market price was lower than the closing price at the end of the year, with English gold bills falling by 2 jiao, American gold bills falling by 3 fen, Hong Kong bills falling by 1 fen, French franc bills falling by 2 li, Singapore bills and Dutch bills each falling by 2 fen, Canadian bills falling by 5 fen, Philippine bills falling by 1 fen, Australian gold bills falling by 1 jiao, and other currencies remaining unchanged.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Large Silver Falls, Indian Silver Rises Again</h3>
<p>London, 4th: Speculators and Citibank merchants sold, and then speculators suddenly came to re-enter long-term positions, and the market situation was still flat. After the closing, the market situation was quiet and dull, and there was a great lack of entrants. The near-term large silver price fell by 1875, and the far-term price remained unchanged. New York silver wire: The price of American silver still has a market but no transaction. Bombay silver wire: The Indian silver market situation is still firm, and both spot and near-term and far-term prices continue to rise by 4 annas.</p>
<h3>Discount Turns Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts hovered around the 40 yuan mark per thousand yuan all day, and finally settled at 39 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, a slight drop of 2 jiao 5 fen compared to the day before the holiday (the 21st).</p>
<h3>Foreign Telegrams and Western Merchants Force Selling; Exchange Market Remains Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange market trended towards loosening and instability due to repeated competition to sell by foreign telegrams from Hong Kong and Little Luzon and local Western merchants such as Sassoon. Although foreign firms and speculative merchants such as yarn and flower gangs piled up in the middle, the trend was unaffected because the banks were still selling and the Chinese financial situation was becoming more stable due to the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet in Japan. Trading was also brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London large silver price was short-term reduced and long-term flat, and the New York spot price remained unchanged. The exchange rate of English against American returned to a large score, against the French rose by 12 centimes, against Shanghai flat. The US dollar was one-sixth of a point long against the British pound, up 4375 against the French, and unchanged against Shanghai. The central listing of various exchange rates remained the same as before. The selling price of spot exchange by banks in the early morning was 8 pence 46875 for English exchange and 16 yuan 375 for American exchange, a slight drop of 03125 for English flat and American compared to the previous Saturday (i.e., before the holiday), because during the close of the market, the English-American exchange rate was reduced by 1 cent 1 li 6 to 1 point 3125. After the opening, foreign telegrams from places such as Hong Kong and Little Luzon were selling quite hard, the yarn and flower gangs took a little bit, and the banks' intake was not strong, causing the process to become increasingly difficult. The English gold price rose to above 8 pence and a half, the American gold price traded over 16 yuan and a half, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also loosened to 56 yuan 875. When the HSBC listing was announced and remained unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced at 10.25%, although speculators piled up, the banks were still selling, and the Western merchant Sassoon's selling intention suddenly became strong, and the money exchange businesses were also strongly selling Hong Kong exchange rates incessantly, so the situation finally became difficult. The closing price at noon was 8 pence 53125 for English gold and 16 yuan 46875 for American gold. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still 56 yuan 875. The following is a list of the transactions opened during the day.</p>
<p>In the later market, due to the continued strong selling by Hong Kong telegrams and the sluggish absorption by banks, the source of supply was smoother than the demand, so although a certain foreign firm settled the piling, the trend was still loose due to the fact that the supply of head positions exceeded the demand. The English gold price once stiffened to 8 pence 5625. After entering, the trading gradually became clear, with only money exchange businesses and others doing Hong Kong exchange trading, so it was slightly flat. The closing selling prices of banks in the evening were 8 pence 546875 for English exchange, 16 yuan and a half for American exchange, and still 56 yuan and 875 for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, the English price increased by 078125, the American price stiffened by 09375, and the Hong Kong exchange rate increased by 125 compared to the previous Saturday (i.e., before the holiday). The following is a record of the transactions opened on a day.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Reverses From Falling to Rising; Types A, B, C, and D All Increase by One Yuan Each; Foreign Debt Unanimously Returns Small Due to Certain Influence</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the securities futures market was the first day of the New Year's red market, and there was a four-day holiday in the middle. The political shocks were quite strong. The absurd telegram from Jingwei had no effect, and the market's sentiment had become relatively stable. When the futures market first opened, large long positions deliberately spread rumors, saying that there might be changes in the payment of interest, or that 500 million new construction bonds would be issued. General blind followers did not consider it, and several firms followed the number one, competing to sell first. The opening price was actually as much as one yuan lower than before the year. Lemao Firm absorbed the most, and various syndicate retail investors also bought in one after another. No. 38 raised the price quite sharply, and the market price actually turned higher very quickly. The results before noon were gains without losses. In the afternoon, general short sellers knew that they had been deceived, and they all covered their positions, and the rising wind suddenly became fierce, especially with No. 5 and Tongkang Firm searching the most violently. The price then rose sharply, and Type A unexpectedly broke through the highest price of 62 yuan 1 jiao on December 24 of last year and saw a new record of 62 yuan 4 jiao, a huge difference of 2 yuan between the high and low. This kind of change from falling to rising was completely a means of both buying and selling parties. Therefore, the shape of ninety-six, which had not been raised or lowered for a long time, was also turning better. According to the current environment and observations of people's hearts, it should be mostly on the rise, but it is also slightly suspected of being too violent. As a result, all rose by one yuan to one yuan, three jiao and five fen, and ninety-six also rose by half a yuan, and the total transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below. The stock market has not yet opened.</p>
<p>London's Chinese Foreign Price on January 3, 28 (Tuesday) Hongshu's listed market price was unanimously reduced due to the impact of China's political development, falling from one pound cattle to half a pound. English continued to borrow English bonds, and the same fell by four pounds because the early-month lottery period had arrived (usually only a reduction of two or three pounds or so after the lottery), and the price was seventy-four pounds. English-issued bonds for the rehabilitation public debt also fell by four pounds for the same reason (interest for half a year should be two pounds and a half), and the price was fifty-four pounds. The Huguang Railway Public Debt non-German-issued bonds fell by one pound and a half, and the price was twenty-four pounds. German-issued bonds with printed bonds also fell by one pound, and the price was twenty-two pounds and a half. The Daoqing Railway Public Debt Railway fell by one pound, and the price was twenty-six pounds. All public debts of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway fell by one pound. The original loans were seventeen pounds each, and the continued loans were sixteen pounds each. The Vickers Aviation Bond fell by fifteen shillings, and the price was thirteen pounds. The Christie's Public Debt and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Public Debt each fell by half a pound, with the former priced at thirty-six pounds and a half and the latter priced at twenty-four pounds.</p>
<p>Also on January 4 (Wednesday), the listed market price was raised by two pounds on English and German continued loans English-issued bonds, and the price was seventy-six pounds. English-French loans English-issued bonds fell by one pound, and the price was fifty-five pounds. The Huguang Railway Public Debt continued to fall by one pound and half a pound, with non-German bonds falling by one pound, and the price was twenty-three pounds. The German-issued bonds with printed bonds continued to fall by half a pound, and the price was twenty-two pounds. Due to the New Year, no wires arrived in Shanghai for the supply of physical goods.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Bran Opens Up Two Corners</h3>
<p>The market conditions of bran continued the glory of the end of last year. The market price has risen by more than two corners compared to before the holiday. Yesterday, the large package of Fuxin Factory bran was priced at two yuan and nine jiao and a half, and the large package of Fuhe Factory bran was priced at two yuan and seven jiao and a half. The issue of warehouse rent has been decided by the factory to be increased because the warehouse receipts for November of last year have not yet seen shipment, but the market conditions are still less affected. However, the actual sales are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude, and only speculators are inquiring about more than 5,000 packages. Currently, the factory's supply is very small, so the market situation is still stable.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Customer Syndicate Bids to Buy; Yarn Market Soars; Suddenly Jumps by Four Yuan to a Huge Nine Yuan; 2,640 Packages Traded</h3>
<p>The yarn and flower red market trading began yesterday. The market price is based on the stable foundation of the end of the year, and the price continues to move forward. All yarns suddenly jumped by a huge four yuan to nine yuan, and the price of cotton cloth pieces also rose by two corners. This is because the Chaoshan and Yunnan syndicates in South China have unremitting needs, and the Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo syndicates in East Zhejiang have the same steps. This news was predicted in the newspaper two days ago. Because the procurement of coarse and fine yarns is coming one after another from all parties, people's hearts are very excited, and the market price is soaring. As for the tenacity of the industry, the raw materials are monopolized by a certain party and cannot fall. The factory's cost has increased, and the profits are becoming thinner, so the absorption is endless. Therefore, the daily industry transactions are very lively. At the opening yesterday, because of the New Year's holiday, all parties had the idea of procurement. At the opening, the customer syndicate first entered the market to release prices and purchase, so the market price jumped by five or six yuan. The Yunfu and Shantou syndicates entered strongly, and the Taiwen and Ningbo syndicates followed suit, so the market price became better and better. As a result, the total amount of trade from the syndicates was 2,640 packages. In the afternoon of the previous day, 140 packages were traded, totaling 2,780 packages. The industry and Qing Dynasty: 20-count extra Jincheng rose by 7 yuan, Shuangma rose by 4 yuan cattle, Samsung rose by 9 yuan, Muyang rose by 7 yuan, Shuangqiu rose by 8 yuan, 16-count and 10-count coarse yarns also rose by 4 yuan to 6 yuan. The factory opened 200 packages of 10-count Delishi from Shenxin, priced at 260 yuan. The Chongxin Factory opened 260 packages of 10-count Dafa, priced at 280 yuan. The New China Factory opened 200 packages of 20-count Wuzi, priced at 260 yuan. The Wing On Factory opened 160 packages of 20-count extra Jincheng, priced at 370 yuan. The New Yu Factory opened 150 packages of 20-count Shuangqiu, priced at 359 yuan. The amount of purchases from each syndicate is listed on the left.</p>
<p>The conditions of the Japanese yarn market are slightly tight due to the rising prices of Chinese yarn, and the popularity has increased by one yuan, but the actual demand is still sluggish. The current price of 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 302 yuan, and the price for this month is 301 yuan. The current price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 3 yuan, and the price for this month is 299 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Sale of Yarn is Smooth; The Demand for Raw Cotton from Original Cotton Mills is Increasing; Yao Clothes Have Started Buying 15,000 Bales; No Orders for Foreign Cotton from Chinese Factories Were Heard Yesterday</h3>
<p>The cotton business is increasingly developing. The recent sales of cotton yarn and cotton cloth have been smooth and the selling price has turned high. Various factories naturally intend to replenish their raw materials. Therefore, red market transactions are also said to be lively. However, transactions involving white-packed flower coarse velvet cotton still dominate. Yao clothes and fire-engine cotton are the most popular. Tongyi and Chongxin factories purchased a large quantity of Yao clothes as raw materials, purchasing 15,000 bales. Hongzhang and Anda each purchased 500 bales. Therefore, the market price suddenly rose by one yuan. Tonghua also increased by one yuan. However, this product is strong and clean. Only fine velvet cotton is still suppressed by Indian cotton, and the market situation is relatively weak. Japanese factories occasionally adopt it. There are few Tongzhou flowers arriving at the pier, only 880 bales. However, 15,800 bales of Yao flowers have arrived. Xinyu Factory ordered 200 bales of Indian cotton, which is a 32-count raw material, and the selling price is only 88 yuan. It is also reported that the later batches of Yao flowers still have a huge amount arriving in Shanghai, and all procedures have been completed. The source is smooth and there is no problem. Also, yesterday 250 pieces of cotton arrived from Xingang, 404 pieces from Beisha, and 350 pieces from Baimao Yanglin. The current prices and quantities of spot cotton sold by various parties are as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The US cotton market in New York was initially weaker due to the completion of some profit-taking in the morning, falling by five or six points. Later, due to President Roosevelt's message, except for a few minor revisions to the issue of farmers in the future, the rest will be implemented according to the original plan. Therefore, the minds of the industry have become more firm. Spot transactions and the purchases of various factories still show signs of progress. Yesterday, New York fell by two or three points, Indian spot and future prices fell by more than 15 points, and Egyptian rose by five or six points. Yesterday's exchange rate was not much different. The price of legal tender and foreign cotton increased by four yuan per picul compared to before the holiday.</p>
<p>Domestic Foreign Cotton Transactions: Although all factories in the local market have fully resumed work today, the price of yarn on the red market rose by another four or five yuan yesterday, with transactions of several thousand bales. However, foreign cotton transactions showed a sluggish trend. This may be due to the firm refusal of various Chinese factories to order foreign cotton. However, it is widely rumored that Shenxin is currently secretly ordering hundreds of bales of Brazilian cotton from a certain Brazilian cotton import foreign firm. The payment terms are to pay a deposit of 10% first, and the remaining 90% will be paid after the ship arrives at the port, and then another 10% deposit. Although the amount is small, if this happens, the interests of the industry should also be considered. If all Chinese factories can always unite and take collective action, and have the spirit of "rather stop work if necessary and refuse to buy foreign cotton," all foreign firms will succumb. The spot market price and transaction volume yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Transaction Volume</p>
<p>Gongda: Imported 300 bales of Indian cotton</p>
<p>Tongyu: Imported 200 bales of Indian cotton</p>
<p>Yu: Imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton</p>
<p>Neiwai: Imported 300 bales of American cotton</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Converted Market Price Listed Below</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Shantou Fine White Sugar Prices are Shouted High</h3>
<p>Yesterday the sugar market trend was stable. The association's price for 24-Dutch coarse white re-export goods was 16 yuan and 25 cents for 400 bales. There was no change in spot goods. Taikoo Car White B Mark in Puxi Wharf was 24 yuan. Although the price of domestic Shantou fine white sugar was shouted up, no transaction was made. Odd white sugar was still opened at 18 yuan and 50 cents to 17 yuan and 50 cents, 100 bales of Zhiyang sugar were 15 yuan and 40 cents, high-quality goods were called at 16 yuan, and over a hundred bales of Jue Shantou red sugar were opened at 12 yuan and 78 cents. Dozens of bales of Donghai red sugar were 12 yuan. Several thousand bales of ordinary Huanggang green sugar were opened at 11 yuan and 67 cents, Longgang green sugar was 10 yuan and 20 cents, and Xinghua sugar opened Mingjing red sugar, a total of more than 500 bales, at 14 yuan and 30 cents. The original price of Diaoqing sugar did not rise or fall, and it continued to be offered. It is said that new goods are difficult to price due to production costs, and there is still a lack of shipping to Shanghai. However, today 1,000 bales of sugar are coming from Hong Kong to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Grain: Spot Flour Sales are Strong Only in the North; Wheat Owners Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Flour yesterday was the first trading day of the year. During the New Year holiday, in addition to repairing machinery, various factories also made a small amount of preparation for domestic wheat raw materials. Therefore, the production volume has increased slightly compared to before. However, the stock of flour is still insufficient, and there is still a lack of large-scale supply. The market price is gradually being shouted higher. Customers dislike the high price and do not intend to buy more. As a result, over 30,000 bags of Green Battleship, Green Cannon, Red Blue Car and other No. 2 flour were sold at a price of 4 yuan and 90 cents, an increase of 5 cents compared to the previous market. Except for 8,000 bags of retail sales in this street, the majority were from the northern gangs, and the southern gangs decided. There are still 15,000 to 16,000 bags of Red God of Wealth and Red Peach Blossom, priced at 4 yuan and 35 cents, and 3,000 to 4,000 bags of Red Blue Fisherman, priced at 4 yuan and 45 cents, all of which were handled by Tianjin and Qinhuangdao and other places. Broken flour is out of stock and there is no market.</p>
<p>Wheat has been arriving daily. During the four-day holiday, over 40,000 bags arrived, most of which were directly allocated to factories. The price was similar to the closing price at the end of the year. Therefore, there are not many sellers on the market, and the price of flour is also high, so the owners are raising prices even more fiercely. As a result, the price is 4 or 5 cents higher than last year's market. It is estimated that Fuxin Factory bought 10,000 bags, and Fu Factory bought 5,000 bags. The highest price of Jiangbei wheat has reached 6 yuan and 65 cents.</p>
<h3>Japonica Rice Sales Become Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday's source of domestic rice: a total of four ships arrived at Hexia, and 6,000 to 7,000 bags of original packages were transported from Baimao and Hupukou. This street and hoarders rarely inquire about them, so people's minds are more stable, and various goods show a trend of oversupply. Customers are thinking of making prices lower, but sellers are struggling to maintain prices due to the heavy cost of the goods that have arrived. Therefore, although japonica rice transactions are not large, Hou Bo japonica rice has only weakened slightly by a few cents. Duyang Jianbu and Jianjian should be in equal demand and have not seen gains or losses. Yin is again out of stock, and Bianyuan is uniquely popular due to the lack of loans, standing out by a few cents.</p>
<p>Today, 4,050 bags of rice were exported, shipped from Hong Kong and transshipped to Tianjin, and another 2,290 bags came from Hong Kong and were transshipped to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Sichuan and Yunnan are Actively Procuring Spring Goods; Business in Hunan and Jiangxi is Gradually Recovering; Large-Scale Purchases are Also Being Made in Wenzhou and Taizhou</h3>
<p>The domestic cloth market opened yesterday for the New Year. The industry generally expects prices to rise, and hoarders intend to hoard more. The selling prices of various goods are all trending upward. Especially the fine cloth and fine twill produced by Shenxin and Shui'an factories are attracting the most speculation, increasing by 2 to 4 dimes per bolt. Coarse cloth is flat. Lunchang floral cloth, satin, and blue cloth have also increased by 1 or 2 dimes. As our army's positions in Hunan and Jiangxi are stable, business is gradually recovering, so they are also focusing on large-scale purchases from Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Taizhou. Demand for fine cloth is particularly strong. Transactions include white fine cloth and fine twill, over 500 pieces of coarse cloth, over 200 boxes of printed cloth, dyed cloth, and printed piece goods. Wenzhou and Taizhou gangs are also handling over 300 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Wholesale hoarders in this port are also in good demand. Transactions include floral cloth and blue cloth produced by Lunchang Factory, which are transshipped to Zhejiang and Jiangxi inland through Wenzhou. Changde gangs are hoarding over 100 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Sichuan and Yunnan gangs have transacted 2,000 bolts of light-colored spring goods such as Piao cloth, poplin, foreign yarn, colored tribute, and standard cloth. Although Hong Kong and Shantou gangs have added purchases of general merchandise, the prices are too high, so they are still hesitant. Orders for various goods are still popular. Due to the need to re-establish import registration procedures, shipments from the Fujian gang are temporarily suspended, but mail is still being sent.</p>
<p>The morning market for Eastern goods was flat and sluggish, but in the afternoon, due to brisk actual sales, the market became tighter. Fine cloth and fine twill increased by about 5 to 7.5 cents per bolt compared to the end of last year. Fine cloth of the Longtou, Caiqiu, and Yanghe brands sold for 10 yuan 85 cents to 90 cents. Transactions between industry insiders and customers amounted to about 2,000 pieces. Foreign firms also opened nearly 1,000 pieces. 12-pound Feiyu fine cloth was ordered at 10 yuan, Longtou Caiqiu at 10 yuan 95 cents, Shuangyu at 10 yuan 5 cents, and Laba Tong at 10 yuan 55 cents, all more than 5 cents higher than the market price, so the market trend is firm.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Yantai and Qixia are the Most Expensive</h3>
<p>Soybean oil and peanut oil have both increased by 2 dimes, which is due to the healthy purchasing demand during the five-day holiday. However, foreign firms are still selling, so the overall market trend depends on whether the market sales can be smooth today. Yesterday, this street transacted 50 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil (see the market price column for行情). 340 cans of Ningbo green peanut oil went to Qingdao, 300 barrels of Dalian soybean oil are available now, and 70 barrels are scheduled for delivery in the first ten days of January, 50 barrels in the last ten days of January, and 400 barrels will be sold by foreign firms in the first ten days of February. Spot transactions of current oil amounted to 30 barrels, and 200 barrels are scheduled for delivery in the last ten days of January. In addition, 100 pieces of Yantai and Qixia oil were opened, and the market price rose by 4 dimes, and 100 pieces were also made for delivery within ten days.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: The Rising Trend of Golden Needles Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Golden needles: as the source has arrived, the strong rising trend has gradually flattened, and the demand from Hong Kong and Guangdong gangs has also slightly decreased. The opening price of the firms is slightly looser than before, and there have not been many transactions in recent days. The higher market prices are 34 to 35 yuan, followed by 31 yuan to 24 to 25 yuan, which vary. Additional costs are added for those with good quality, plump body, bright color, and a thousand-piece body.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Gual鳞甲片 Becomes Slightly Softer After Rising</h3>
<p>鱗甲票 is scarce, so the market has repeatedly risen. High-quality goods were intended to rise to 260 yuan per picul, followed by 230 yuan. Until now, the outbound route has been reduced, but the source is still felt, and the bottom stock is also rare, so it has presented a stable appearance.</p>

<h3>Returning Guest</h3>
<p>— Qiu Zhushi</p>
<p>The wind and snow are heavy, the firewood door at dusk.</p>
<p>Desolate old ferry</p>
<p>A returning guest from thousands of miles away is mooring.</p>
<p>Around a circle of fences, still</p>
<p>Citrus protects the cold smoke;</p>
<p>Recognize the owner's house, the wandering dragon grass is scattered</p>
<p>——A dim lintel.</p>
<p>A string of tears mixed with a string of heartbeats,</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles of shoes gnaw at the green moss on the steps,</p>
<p>Returning from the sky full of flames,</p>
<p>And calmly knocked on the peaceful firewood door of the home.</p>
<p>White hair fluttering,</p>
<p>Faintly seen in a dream.</p>
<p>However, there is a shadow of a lamp on the screen wall,</p>
<p>Giving the surprised old tears a glimmer of silver.</p>
<p>Shining on the plain wall, this familiar plain wall, the lamp</p>
<p>Blooms in the red flames.</p>
<p>(The blooming lamp illuminates the blooming heart of the mother.)</p>
<p>Listen to the returning guest's thrilling narration,</p>
<p>Mother, washing away the year's fatigue and hardship.</p>
<p>"The mountain car went crazy,</p>
<p>Circling the verdant peaks.</p>
<p>Here, you can call God and tell him,</p>
<p>Say: There is a group of refugees</p>
<p>Lambs begging for mercy.</p>
<p>However, God is sleeping peacefully at his desk,</p>
<p>The wild eagle is laying eggs in the higher sky."</p>
<p>Listening to these,</p>
<p>Like listening to ancient fairy tales,</p>
<p>The mother's ancient heart extracts fear:</p>
<p>The twentieth century is said to be a civilized world,</p>
<p>Who is it, who is playing cruel old tricks?</p>
<p>However, the mother is temporarily happy after all,</p>
<p>Because the desolate old ferry</p>
<p>A returning guest from thousands of miles away is mooring.</p>
<p>The wind and snow are heavy, the firewood door at dusk.</p>
<h3>Iron Current</h3>
<p>— Situ Zong</p>
<p>——In Memory of Warrior Zhou Dagen</p>
<p>Squad leader Zhou Dagen's face was red as he faced the staff officer:</p>
<p>"This is not child's play, you have to consider it carefully!"</p>
<p>As soon as the words came out, Dagen immediately felt that it was not quite right; this did not sound like something he would say! In the long ten years of fighting against the evil forces in the past, he had never said weak words at all! What's more, it was at this emergency moment. The other party's two sharp eyes were pressing on him tightly, and a faint smile was revealed on his long face!</p>
<p>"Please don't misunderstand!" Dagen quickly made a correction to his own words: "This is not a consideration of whether to do it or not, but a careful consideration of the method!"</p>
<p>Really, to do it, Dagen had long thought it was not a problem! Perhaps it was because he was preparing to do it painfully at all times that he caused this decision! The jealousy of friendly troops, the attention of the enemy, perhaps because of the fact that he was actually doing it.</p>
<p>As soon as Dagen thought of doing it, his whole body was filled with heat, and a new force seemed to come to his iron-like arms. However, dividing the only hundred or so comrades into two groups to meet the enemy seemed to be a problem worth considering.</p>
<p>"Consideration..." Dagen dragged out two words so lightly again; at the same time, he aimed his painful eyes at the staff officer, as if expecting the staff officer's understanding.</p>
<p>In fact, the staff officer would never misunderstand. There was already a chain-like connection between hearts, and suspicion would never play a role in their idleness!</p>
<p>"Right?" The staff officer said with a smile: "The strength is weak?"</p>
<p>Dagen nodded quickly, and his heart seemed to lighten a lot.</p>
<p>"But," the staff officer continued, "since the enemy is coming in separate ways, we have to meet the enemy in separate ways, could it be..."</p>
<p>"No, please don't say it!" Dagen roared loudly: "Could it be that we are willing to escape and retreat!"</p>
<p>This will never happen. In Dagen, in the staff officer, and in the hearts of more than one hundred comrades, such an idea will never arise. This is the time to correct the psychology of the people with action! Let the people know that although there is a dark side in the guerrilla area, it is also making bright progress at the same time!</p>
<p>The arrangement was completed in a very short time. More than one hundred comrades carried excited and nervous hearts, and at the same time, each of their hearts was filled with anger. When they crawled through the grass in the pouring rain, they were so angry that their whole bodies cramped. The enemy would be so familiar with such a winding path! This is not, this is not... Alas!</p>
<p>"Traitors! Traitors..." Everyone gritted their teeth.</p>
<p>A series of undulating cemeteries became their fortresses; two light machine guns served as their bodies, and they excitedly shouted loudly to everyone:</p>
<p>"Prepare! Hold on to our guns! The south is already in contact!"</p>
<p>However, there was no movement in the east here. Ten minutes, twenty minutes, this was really difficult time to endure! Listening to the roar of other people's gunfire, the comrades here were a little itchy. Especially Dagen, who was even more full of anxiety. Until the gunfire in the south slowly subsided, and no enemy traces were found here.</p>
<p>"This, this, could it be that the enemy is concentrating in one place,...then, maybe they won't be able to stop it!... "</p>
<p>The cessation of gunfire in the south brought even more unease and worry to Dagen. He could no longer be the vanguard of the southeast and east roads; Dagen and the staff officer took on the command of the two roads.</p>
<p>The rain had already soaked through their thin clothes, and the wind was blowing even harder. Dagen was hurriedly inspecting every fortress, forgetting that the raindrops on his head were pouring straight down his face. When he walked in front of every comrade lying behind the grave, he always squatted down and patted the wet shoulder:</p>
<p>"Comrade, don't miss this opportunity!"</p>
<p>Only when a determined smile appeared on the black and fat face that was lifted up, he could switch to another one with peace of mind...</p>
<p>Suddenly, there were a few sporadic gunshots from the south, but then there was a dense roar of machine guns. Dagen immediately lay down and waited quietly. He jumped up and whispered:</p>
<p>"Be careful, I'll go take a look!"</p>
<p>He nimbly went to the side of the river. He quickly waved his arms, wanting to greet the comrades lying behind the graves, preparing to intercept the enemy across the river.</p>
<p>But, "Bang!"</p>
<p>A bullet hit his chest right in the front. A burst of pain almost knocked him to the ground. He quickly pressed his chest with his hand and turned back to run and shout into the woods, but he did not run more than three steps. The second bullet had already hit his head.</p>
<p>At this moment, the staff officer also brought his troops from the south, and the comrades lying behind the graves had also jumped up.</p>
<p>"Retreat to the north!" This was the staff officer's order.</p>
<p>But what answered him was a roar of charge; an iron current jumped over Dagen's corpse and rushed to the riverside...</p>
<h3>Talking About "Name" Again</h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>Let's talk about "name" again this time.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the old saying: "If the name is not correct, then the words will not be fluent;..."</p>
<p>This should be an oriental-style cliché, but unexpectedly, Hitler also greeted this cliché from afar, and did his best.</p>
<p>The annexation of Austria and the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and even the rest, seemed to seek the largest common denominator in these different figures, and spoke loudly:</p>
<p>"Nation and state!" "The issue of ethnic minorities!"</p>
<p>What a resounding and pleasant term! After such a "rectification of name", it would naturally be much easier to do, and the world would have to look at it with sidelong glances.</p>
<p>The methods are as spicy as they may be, and the presentation is as roaring as it may be, but after all, there is a bit of... undoubtedly a bit of guarding against the "Spring and Autumn Annals straight pen".</p>
<p>"I can't help but be annoyed, what should I do?"</p>
<p>"I have an idea! Let me set up a soul-stirring formation," so:</p>
<p>"Referendum!"</p>
<p>Very pretty, magnificent! These "manageable" masses are first caught in hand.</p>
<p>Post-event investigation shows that this term, apart from being used when the Sudetenland issue arose in Czechoslovakia, was also replicated in South Africa's mandated territory of Southwest Africa. What about after that? Where to go from there?</p>
<p>In the trend of terms that have never had national borders, I especially feel the crisis after these kinds of terms are unfortunately "spread eastward" this time.</p>
<p>Will our country catch a cold and have a fever? This depends entirely on how strong the "antidote" hidden within itself is.</p>
<p>However, from "Imperial Way" to "Paradise" (?), a chorus of "Asia" and "Asia" arose, and there were even "new systems", "new orders", and "peace", "harmony"... and the like, all with great names and novel patterns, which were abundant and filled the ears, were they not beautiful!</p>
<p>China has always attached importance to "rectifying names", and this matter is extremely important and cannot be taken lightly. If you are not careful, when you want to clean it up, the difficulty is equal to "prying stones down the mountain", and there is no place to use your strength.</p>
<p>Losing a few cities is not uncommon; even scorched earth will grow new seedlings. Only people – unruly people! The hooks and snares that confuse the public with names must be analyzed clearly; what kind of medicine is sold in that gourd? Propaganda under false pretenses should be corrected or refuted outright.</p>
<p>This is not a pedantic "caviling over words", but the first mountain-opening axe to prevent problems before they occur. All enlightened people should come and deliberate, and it is imperative to strive for it. "When drinking water, think of the source", "Name! Name! "Taking care of name" most important is to "think of meaning"; especially when she is about to "sheath the sword and cultivate literature".</p>
<p>At this time, perhaps the "sugar coating" is layered on top of each other!</p>
<h3>How to Choose a Topic</h3>
<p>— Zi Qing</p>
<p>Generally speaking, we people who like to write articles always feel that there is no story to write when we pick up a pen, and we don’t know where to start. In other words, we can’t find a suitable “topic” to write about.</p>
<p>Yes, the value and us of a work are closely related to the object of description – the topic. It can make people have a deep resonance after reading or describing it, as if the story written is completely the reader's own story, this function relies on how to choose the "topic". Then, the question of "how to choose a topic" should and must be raised before every author.</p>
<p>The question of "choosing a topic", first of all, I think what needs to be understood is to know the variability of the times and the environment. For example, in the current period of the War of Resistance, the topics we want to write about cannot be separated from various life descriptions that are beneficial to the "War of Resistance", otherwise, even if it is published, it is equivalent to a waste of paper to the reader, so that the reader cannot deeply appreciate it, and even makes people hate it! If we describe some stories related to the War of Resistance, such as the lives of soldiers on the front line, the rescue and propaganda work of patriotic young men and women who are active in various places, or the encounters of refugees in the rear and occupied areas, and the portrayal of various vicious killings and looting by the enemy, we only need to apply these living topics well, and we can enable general readers to obtain a "sense of reality", and deeply sympathize and resonate, and even inspire readers to participate in various tasks that are beneficial to the "War of Resistance". Therefore, to say that a work that makes people deeply meaningful, first of all, we must pay attention to whether its topic is in line with the times.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we want to think of is not to forget the "authenticity" of the story. Because only under the abstract consciousness of conforming to the times, if we do not carefully measure the authenticity of the topic, this will not increase the value of the work. For example, to describe the refugees in the refugees, if you have not experienced the authenticity of the refugee life, only from the fragments of news obtained from third parties or various aspects, and you pick up a pen to write a piece together, this is simply a joke, and it has no impact on the facts. Therefore, to choose a topic, we must also pay attention to its authenticity.</p>
<p>Finally, we must pay attention to how to organize this topic. Because the factual facts, reflected in the subjective consciousness, are still fragmented stories. To connect them into a systematic story, we have to organize them, so that it is in line with science, so that readers can get a deep impression after reading it, and not spend too much time.</p>
<p>Dear writers, I put forward this question, hoping that it will become a reference for your writing.</p>

<h3>New Year Talk on Auspicious Marriage (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Factory</p>
<p>Every New Year's Day, various theaters in Beiping would stage auspicious new plays, such as "Drunken Concubine," "A Bed Full of Tablets" (i.e., "Beating the Golden Branch"), "The Imperial Stele Pavilion," and "Auspicious Marriage," among others. Some were chosen for their auspicious names, others for their happy endings. Overall, the intention was to bring good luck to the audience at the beginning of the year. In Beiping, on New Year's Day, Mei Lanfang loved to sing "Drunken Concubine" or "The Imperial Stele Pavilion," Shang Xiaoyun loved to perform "A Bed Full of Tablets," and there were three famous actors who loved to perform "Auspicious Marriage": Xun Huisheng, one of the four great Dan actors; Xiao Cuihua, the leading Hua Dan; and Zhu Qinxin, an amateur-turned-professional. I have seen all three of their performances of "Auspicious Marriage" because I particularly loved this play and saw it more than once. I won't go into detail about their different artistic styles. Now, let me first discuss the structure of the play and the expressions that should be displayed in the performance! The story of "Auspicious Marriage" is as follows: Scholar Mo Ji's house was destroyed by fire, and he was reduced to begging. One day, in the cold and snow, Mo Ji, suffering from hunger and cold, collapsed at the gate of Jin Song, the leader of the beggars. Jin was out at the time, and his daughter Yu Nu heard a collapsing sound outside the door and went out to see Mo Ji. Yu Nu, feeling sorry for him, gave him some leftover food and a bowl of bean juice, which saved his life. When Old Jin returned, he learned that Mo was a scholar and saw that Yu Nu admired him, so he betrothed Yu Nu to him. After they got married, the young couple was very loving. However, Yu Nu had great ambitions and did not want to beg all the time, so she persuaded Mo to seek fame. Later, Mo took Jin and his daughter to the capital to take the exam. Along the way, Mo focused on his studies, while Old Jin begged everywhere to feed his talented son-in-law. After the results were announced, Mo unexpectedly passed and was appointed magistrate. Old Jin and his daughter were rejoicing when Mo changed his mind, fearing that he would be ridiculed for having a beggar wife. On the way to his post, he plotted to push Yu Nu into the water and drove Old Jin away. After Yu Nu fell into the water, she was rescued by Examiner Lin, who took her in as his adopted daughter. Yu Nu explained what had happened, and Examiner Lin was furious at Mo Ji's actions and promised to avenge her. Coincidentally, Mo Ji was Examiner Lin's son-in-law. After they met, Examiner Lin asked him if he had a wife. To marry into a high-ranking family, he kept silent about his past. Examiner Lin then married his daughter (who was actually Yu Nu) to him. On their wedding night, filled with joy, he entered the room and realized that she was his former wife, Yu Nu. He was ashamed, and Yu Nu ordered the servants to beat him. With Examiner Lin's mediation, they reconciled. At that time, Old Jin also found his way to their post, and the whole family celebrated their reunion. From the story of this play, it is clear that it is dedicated to depicting the consequences of being ungrateful due to excessive vanity. In terms of structure, it is extremely tight. The protagonist is, of course, Jin Yu Nu. Playing this role should be divided into several periods and several attitudes.</p>
<h3>Believe It or Not: Fat Daughter Zhu Nianzhen Is Only Eight Years Old This Year and Weighs 150 Pounds. If She Were in Hollywood, She Would Have Been Hired as an Actress Long Ago.</h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>"We originally lived in Hongzhen. We fled here because of the Japanese war!"</p>
<p>Her father wasn't found. Upstairs in a fruit store on Jiujiang Road, a chubby, short girl was speaking very lively in front of a stranger.</p>
<p>"Who says she's only eight years old? Look at her size! A thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy is in the first grade. The homeroom teacher's surname is Yan. Everyone stares at me when I go out on the street, it's really annoying."</p>
<p>Wearing an Indanthrene-dyed shirt and a thick silver ring around her neck, her hair was not long, but the parted peach-shaped buns were neatly combed. Her stature was more than three feet tall, and her waist was very thick. She said:</p>
<p>"I suddenly started gaining weight at six years old. Children were only that size at that age. What's even stranger is her face. If I hadn't known she was a girl, I wouldn't have been able to guess that she wasn't a boy."</p>
<p>When she saw me, and I mentioned that I came specifically to see her, she was overcome by a girl's shyness and ran inside. However, after hearing the visitor's kind and friendly conversation, she came out to talk more familiarly.</p>
<p>"I studied at Huaming Primary School before the war, and now it's the Lian Primary School on Fourth Horse Road. Although I've never been thin since I was little, I now weigh 150 pounds, which is 105 catties on the Chinese scale, but I only eat two big bowls of rice!"</p>
<p>Judging by her expression, she was quite alert and intelligent, and certainly not as weak as an eight-year-old girl. She went to get a photo and picked up a pen to write her name, hardly any different from a thirteen or fourteen-year-old boy.</p>
<p>This child is quite clever. At first glance, she reminded people of the singer Yin Xiucen, because her face and the flesh under her jaw were very similar. If she were in Hollywood, such a rare child would surely have been hired at a high price by managers who specialize in collecting curiosities to make movies for film companies.</p>
<p>Her mother is sick, and her father is on duty at the police station. She has to go in to serve them urgently. Her neighbor told me that she is from Xuzhou, and her father, Zhu Chiqing, is an investigator at the Central Police Station, but I think her Shanghai dialect and Xuzhou dialect are both quite good.</p>
<h3>Hollywood News</h3>
<p>— Qiu Wen</p>
<p>Wireless Radio Cinema Completed</p>
<p>The success of wireless image transmission can be said to be a world-shaking and great invention in science. Recently, the British Gaumont Film Company specially invested 5 million pounds to convert the Dumining Film Experimental Field under its jurisdiction into a Royal Wireless Radio Cinema. The British government has also made a large amount of donations to join. The person in charge is John Felrdia, the inventor of broadcast film, who has completed the test after thirty-three trials. It is heard that the screen for playing movies is only ten inches high and fourteen inches wide. In this way, images can be transmitted on a wireless motor that is a thousand times larger. It is estimated that it will be ready for opening in the autumn of 1939. From then on, you can sit at home and watch movies.</p>
<p>Paramount Dismisses Japanese Star</p>
<p>Kami Murano, a Japanese female movie star affiliated with Paramount Corporation (translated as "Tushia Mari" in English), has been in Hollywood for eight or nine years. Recently, she was suddenly dismissed by the company. It is said that because her recent new work, "The New History of the Holy Forest," suffered a disastrous drop in attendance when it was screened in New York, the company authorities were deeply dissatisfied and took this action. It is still a novel story that foreign actors are being excluded in Hollywood.</p>
<p>New Charlie Chan to Appear on the Screen</p>
<p>Since Warner Oland, famous for playing the great Chinese detective Charlie Chan, passed away, the 20th Century Company has been publicly soliciting a replacement who looks very similar to Warner Oland. In October of last year, a foreman from a soap factory in Lornega, America, went to apply and was hired by the authorities, and both parties have signed a contract. This person's name is Sidney Torey, and he is 42 years old this year. It is reported that the script for his first work has been completed, and the film may be titled "The Strange Case of the Grand Hotel."</p>
<p>Shirley Temple Takes an African as Her Teacher</p>
<p>Recently, child star Shirley Temple suddenly took an African as her teacher. The African is also an actor from the 20th Century, named Robeson, who is the founder of tap dancing. He is the African in "The Little Matchmaker." The introducer is the big star Eleanor Powell. Moreover, it is said that Temple has to pay him a large teaching fee every week! This African is considered to be lucky.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Theater News</h3>
<p>— Chan Weng</p>
<p>On the 27th of last month, the Tianjin Lions Club hosted a charity performance for winter relief. It was held at the Chinese Theater. The most exciting performances included Shang Heyu's "Yanyang Tower," Xiao Cuihua's "Drunken Concubine," Jin Shaoshan's "Bai Liangguan," and Ma Lianliang, Zhang Junqiu, and Ma Jinglu's full version of "Qingfeng Pavilion." Because there were too many plays, it took too long to perform. "Qingfeng Pavilion" was only performed until "Looking for a Son" and then stopped. Following "The Bridal Sedan Chair Takes Wukong," Li Wanchun continued to arrange "The Monkey King's Birth and Apprenticeship to Bodhi" and "The Eighteen Arhats Subdue the Great Peng," two excerpts. Recently, the music circles of Pingjin have been extremely welcoming of monkey operas. In addition to Li Wanchun, Li Shaochun, Sun Yukun, Yang Shengchun, Liu Zongyang, Shang Changchun, and others are all using Sun Wukong as a means of attracting audiences.</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng recently stayed in Tianjin for performances. On New Year's Day in the new calendar, he performed at the Chinese Theater. Jupeng's son, Shaopeng, and daughter, Huizhu, also appeared on stage at the same time. Jupeng specially invited the famous Huqin player Guo Shaochen to play the strings for his daughter to add color to the performance.</p>
<p>Since Mao Shilai performed "Killing a Son for Revenge," the attendance has been quite good. Now, Yang Yunpu has given him the script for "The Honeycomb Story," which is currently in rehearsal. According to reports, "The Honeycomb Story" is a secret script that has disappeared from the opera stage. The content is fiery and the plot is tense, surpassing "Killing a Son for Revenge" in excitement. It is expected that its first performance will cause another sensation.</p>
<h3>Chess Corner</h3>

<p>Screen Horse Against Center Cannon (Sideways Chariot Method)</p>
<p>Yesterday's published methods were explained:</p>
<p>Pawn 3 Advances 1, intending to wait for an opportunity to move; Chariot 1 Advances 1, then the black Chariot 9 Moves to 8, which seems to be an unnecessary move. Therefore, Horse 2 Advances 3, Pawn 7 Advances 1, opening the Horse path. Even if the red Chariot prohibits the Horse on the third road, it cannot prohibit the seventh road. Horse 8 Advances 7, using the coiled-head flanked Horse Cannon formation, with the intention of attacking the central road. Cannon 8 Advances 2, which can defend the central road, preventing the opponent from advancing rashly, and Horse 3 Advances 4, preparing to capture the Chariot. Chariot 6 Moves to 7 to suppress the Horse, Chariot 1 Moves to 3, conveniently bringing out the Chariot, and secretly hiding the capture of the Chariot. If the Chariot is allowed to be taken, then Chariot 6 Moves to 7 is the same as not moving, and the red side gains the initiative while the black side loses the initiative. If we calculate the number of moves at this time, the player who moves second has eight steps, while the player who moves first only has six steps. In an even game for initiative, there seems to be no difference of two steps. According to the situation in this game, Chariot 6 Advances 5, changing to Pawn 5 Advances 1, then the forces are evenly matched. Although the victory or defeat is undecided, the opening is such that a considerable advantage is gained.</p>

<p>Jupeng and Chen are both Tan school old sheng actors who started halfway, so they naturally don't have the skills in their waists and legs. Jupeng's problem is that he "likes to stick out his small belly," while Chen "likes to hunch his back and raise his buttocks high." Therefore, Shu Yan joked with them, "It's best to have Chen cross-dress as Cao Cao and perform 'Catch and Release' with Jupeng. When the two of them come on stage together, one in front and one behind, their stage walk looks quite good." Little Yu's mouth is really good at criticizing people; people say that he has no son (only two daughters) because he lacks moral integrity.</p>
<p>Shu Yan's wife, née Chen (daughter of Delin), passed away four years ago. Only at the funeral did he feel the lack of a son in front of the coffin, not even someone to wear mourning clothes. He felt truly desolate and full of regrets. He was usually proud and unwilling to take apprentices. Although Yang Baozhong had formally apprenticed to him, he refused to acknowledge it. As for the other fake Yu school old sheng actors, there was even less to say. Who knew that Shu Yan's wife's death would create an opportunity for those fake disciples? Everyone saw Shu Yan's thoughts and hurriedly made mourning clothes, practically wearing the heavy mourning clothes of a disciple. By the time the funeral procession arrived, Baozhong, Maisen, Fuying, Shaolou, and Shaolin (considered a brother-in-law and a disciple) were arranged at the head of the coffin as if they had received an imperial decree, seeming more authorized than those who had truly served as ancestors. In this way, no matter how stubborn Shu Yan was, he could not erase the facts. Therefore, he later saw through worldly affairs somewhat and opened the door of convenience. As a result, female actor Meng Xiaodong often went to Yu's house to ask for instruction. Now, Li Shaochun has formally apprenticed to him. Shu Yan, who had always insisted on not accepting insider disciples, has now greatly changed his mind.</p>
<p>His personality was very lonely in the previous years. He usually didn't go out much. When he was at home, besides his family of four (wife and two daughters), there were also two friends who often visited and a Qin master who came every day.</p>
