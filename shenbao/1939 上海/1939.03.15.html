<p>社評</p>
<h3>關於游擊戰區之紀述</h3>
<p>時人好以孤島稱上海，以其陸路交通之頻絕，惟海舶可航，確有類乎孤島；益以四周人事阻梗，其情境遂見孤之尤。新聞事業固以羣居之廣·交通之暢爲基本條件者也；以上海之尤孤，新聞事業之遭遇乃大難，難在事業本身者，惟由斯業自謀解脫之道，未足取爲報端論述之資；顧有一事，為當前特殊狀態之產物·竊願籲請各方愛護報紙者予以合作。</p>
<p>其事維何？讀者最注意之紀述，莫如戰訉。戰訉來自戰區，戰區二類；一爲綿延之陣地戰區，一爲廣大之游擊戰區。陣地戰區爲綫爲點，游擊戰區爲平面甚至爲立體。言綫則北自晋北，南至海南；其間若冀東魯南蘇北浙西皆點也；綿延甚矣。言游擊戰區，則江浙間以太湖為中心，浦東以南匯爲中心，大江下游以通祟海爲中心，皖北以洪澤湖爲中心，更自魯東冀南豫北而至於綏遠熱河遼髯吉林黑龍江，廣大極矣。陣地戰區之戰訉，由前綫而後方，輻輳於重慶，播之國內外；迅速詳盡準確，孤島與華盛頓倫敦香港同，與重慶亦同；初未嘗以特殊狀態而落後。獨關於游擊戰區之戰訉則大難。</p>
<p>報人不能深入游擊戰區，躬親採訪，其原因極多；或深入矣，或原有之新聞綱未盡毀，顧採訪所得，仍無法經常供給報紙。於是報紙蒐集游擊戰區之戰訉，非另闢蹊徑不可。年餘以來，報紙所刋游擊報道，量不在少，殊非容易得來。詎知以採訪與供給之未能悉如常軌，於是而於迅速，於詳盡，於凖備，不免於時發生問題。尤以社會屬望之殷輒相鞭策責難；槪舉數端：其一，各區游擊，頗多艱苦卓絕之創作；仁人志士，前仆後繼，或成功，或成仁；其人其事，胥足以昭吿天下後世者也。是應如何儘量宣揚，以褒先烈，激勸後起？顧乃爲報紙所忽視，忠骸與草木同腐，姓名湮沒而不彰。藉曰許身國族，無名英雄，為國捐軀，心安理得，但願抗戰勝，建國成，便可含笑九泉，豈爭流芳百世；然轟轟烈烈之事績，非報紙取材之理想對象耶，何以不紀？其二，或奸宄內訌，圖窮七見，於是而囂呶擾攘，雞犬為之不寗；或無賴竊發，或私怨相尋，於是而搏擊械圖，閭里飽受虛驚；或夜半鎗聲，不知所來，或途中架刧，不知所往，追求究竟，祇是强暴肆威肆虐；顧乃報紙昧於眞相，張揚其辭曰，游擊壯士之襲擊也，激戰也，殲敵也，懲奸也，大獲而歸，全師而退也。此在不知究竟者，但見情况依然，將慨歎於徒勞無力；此在知其實際者，舉一例百，以爲如此游擊，能不氣短？孤島近太湖游擊區，與南匯暨通崇海亦隔江相望；耳目較便，紀述較多，然據來自此數地者，謂各報所紀游擊之失實者亦十之二三云。</p>
<p>凡此責難，為報人所漸恧，亦報紙所决不諉卸之責任。今後應如何使轟轟烈烈之事績，紀實刋布，如何使形形色色之訛傳，絕跡報端，是為報人所應努力。然以上海還境之閉塞，新聞機構之遜於平時，有不得不期待各方明達者；在此第二期抗戰之中，游擊戰術旣愈趨重要，游擊部隊旣大量增加，而其組織與指揮，亦有近頃之重慶電訊證明其有健全而統一之辦法，則為游擊區之現實情况作迅速詳盡凖確之宣傳，固不僅應報紙讀者之注意與需求而已，抑亦愛護游擊部隊，與促進游擊功能所必要也。自宣傳促進其功能，要在表揚勛績；自宣傳愛護其部隊，要在辨別真偽，揭發假借游擊名義而肆惡之無賴；以正一般人民之視聽。此種努力，在報紙為職無旁貸，然深信各方人士而多予報人以臂助，則為效必更宏。例以言之，太湖區人士决不使太湖區游擊之功績湮沒不彰，不坐視太湖區游擊情况有所訛傳，不放任太湖區奷宄盜匪土棍之汚辱游擊聲譽。推而至於各地，無不如是。此則非僅報紙消息之虛實問題，蓋所以促進游擊功能者，亦即所以加速第二期抗戰之成就者也。</p>

<h3>史丹林報吿書（三續）</h3>
<p>「就生產技術與工業發展之速率而言、吾人巳超過主要資本主義國家、甚善、但仍然不够、必須在經濟上亦能超過彼等、吾人能如此、亦必須如此、唯在經濟上能超過其他主要資本主義國家、吾國乃能有大量消費品及生產品、使吾人能由第一期共產主義過渡於第二期、</p>
<p>本期農業亦穩定增加、此增加不但表現於農產品之增多、而社會主義農業之增多、私人農業之消減、亦爲一證、集體農塲產穀、由一九三三之七五百萬海克他、增爲一九三八之九二百萬海克他、私人出產、由一九三三之　五七百萬海克他、减爲一九三八之六十萬海克他、集體農塲近包括十八八百萬農家、佔全數百分之九三五〇、此數不包括集體漁塲及集體手工業、此證明集體農塲已經强固而穩定、社會主義制度乃吾國最適合之農塲制度、</p>
<p>史丹林於是列舉數字、說明種植面積與集體農塲之設備、國家農塲之電犁收獲器與其他機器、一九三三年所用電犁數爲二一〇·九〇〇、一九三四爲二七六·四〇〇、一九三五爲三六〇·三〇〇、一九三六爲四二二·七〇〇、一九三七爲四五四·五〇〇、一九三八爲四八三·五〇○、六年間共增百分之百餘、　　一九三三收獲　數爲二五四〇〇、一九三八爲一五三·五〇〇、增百分之五百餘、</p>
<p>史丹林謂吾國農業經常居世界第一、爲世界最機械化之農業、因而佔有世界最大之市塲、同時亦較之其他國家使用機器最多、</p>
<p>工業與農業之進步、係有國內貿易之發展、</p>
<p>國家與集體貿易經營增百分之一七八、集體農塲之零賣增百分之一一二、</p>
<p>工農之進步、將引起生活程度之提高、事實亦正如此、</p>
<p>一現在失業與失家農人流落餓斃、乞求救濟之現象、已不再有、此種時期早已過去、今日吾人不妨要求集體農塲、每年至少生產一百五十萬靑年集體農民、爲工業生產之用、集體農塲已非常富足、宜記取若無彼等之助力、吾國工業已難發展、而工業若不發展、則農民所需之工業生產品不能滿足、以彼等技術之充分發展、彼等應能供給一部分人工爲工業之用、此輩人工從事工業、以對於國家經濟將爲莫大之收獲、國家總收入在一九三三爲四八、五〇〇百萬盧布、一九三八爲一〇五、〇〇〇百萬盧布、工人與雇員之數、一九三三爲二二百萬餘、一九三八爲二八百萬、工人與雇員年支薪由一九三三之二四、九五三百萬盧布、增至一九三八之九二、四二五百萬盧布、「一九三三年時、工業工人每人每年平均工銀爲一五一三盧布、至一九三八年則增達三四四七盧布、一九三三年各集體農塲現款收入總額爲五·六六一·九百萬盧布、一九三七年增至一四·一八〇·一百萬盧布、一九三三年各穀區集成農民每戶分得穀六一蒲德、一九三七年則增至一四四蒲德、而緊急備用之種籽飼養特種牲口之芻料、完納糧棵及報酬機器曳引機站工作之代金物品等尙不在內「國家預算中、特別事項及文化發展之經費、一九三三年爲五·八三九·九百萬盧布、一九三八年增至三五·二〇二·五百萬盧布、本期內人民之文化發展實等於文化革命、應用民族語言之普及强迫小學敎育已實施於全國、各級學校增加無數、學生亦增多不少、受過大學敎育之專門人才日益增多、蘇維埃新知識份子業已產生及鞏固、此新社會主義的、人民的知識份子之產生、乃吾國文化革命最重要之成績、</p>
<p>「此外、本期內最重要成績之一即國內地位之更增鞏固、蘇維埃政權之更臻鞏固、蘇維埃社會目前與任何資本主義社會不同之特徵、爲其內部己無衝突敵對之階級、爲剝削階級已經掃除、而構成此社會之工農及知識份子，則以敎睦合作之基礎生活與工作、正在此基礎上、各種動力如蘇維埃社會之道德的及政治的團結、各民族之友誼、蘇維埃愛國主義等、方得發展起來、正在此基礎上、產生了一九三六年十一月通過之蘇聯憲法、以及國內各最高機關選舉之澈底民主化、由于此種純一性及內部團結、戰時紅軍後方及前綫、將强過任何國家、此乃國外偏好武力衝突之人士所必須記憶者也、」</p>
<p>「一部份國外報紙發言人曾傳播無稽之談、稱蘇聯各組織之淸除間諜、暗殺犯及破壞者如托洛茨基、齊諾維夫、卡美涅夫、雅基爾、社哈策夫斯基、羅森高爾資、布哈林等惡魔、已「削弱蘇維埃政權之力量」、引致騷亂』、此種妄語實屬滑稽可笑、以常理言之、蘇維埃組織之淸除此種間諜、暗殺犯及破壞者、豈不應使各該組織更臻强固、即以哈山湖事件言之、豈猶」不能證明淸除間諜及破壞者適爲增强上述組織之最好方法」、（未完）</p>

<h3>人口增加運輸不便　粵桂民食正籌調劑</h3>
<p>廣西各縣米價可望平定粵省决改設糧食管理處</p>
<p>香港通訊、糧食一項、為粵桂兩省當前之重大問題、柳潯梧鬰各區屬、本為餘米之地、每年榖米雜糧有大量之出產、除供給全區人民自用外、尚有多量之輸出、　桂龍百各區屬、其產量雖較以上各區屬為少、但得風雨調勻、幾時豐稔、則亦可以自給、間或荒歉、亦可仰給柳潯梧鬰各區轉輸接濟　桂省當局、常以自給自足政策誇耀於外、不為無因也、但自廣州武漢淪陷後、湘粵難民之避入桂境者絡繹於途、桂省人口、</p>
<p>突然增加</p>
<p>二百餘萬人多、省外避難民衆之入桂者、又多遷居於桂林柳慶之間、桂林區之糧食向昔不足、一旦人口劇增、則榖米自然求過於供、至於南寗以上之龍州百色各屬、土地貧瘠、向非餘米之地、當政局承平地方無事之時、每屆入春、即感覺糧食不敷、須藉外屬源源運往接濟　今也抗戰軍事緊張、大河流域及接連粵邊各屬之公路一律　壞、厲行堅　清野、以致糧食輸運艱難、縱有接濟、亦苦運費之昂貴、因而榖米價格日漸高漲、據本月份桂林榖米報價、上　　每百斤　　票十八元至二十元、米每百斤沾二十七元至　十元、龍州百色各屬與桂林比價約低十分之一五、潯　鬰各屬與桂林比價約低十分之三五、其　數如是之巨者、實　　各屬公路破壞交通不便、　人口增加產量短少、　　秋大河上游各屬稍罹旱炎、民間無多餘存儲、　當局現為</p>
<p>調劑糧食</p>
<p>起見、一面撥給巨款及船隻、向柳梧鬰各屬大量購買、運往上游囤存發售、以壓平米價、並備荒歉、又一面限制各縣殷富、不准囤積榖米　並禁米商過　壟斷、然以桂省整個糧食問題觀之　其所缺乏者、不過偏遠之十數縣份、稍經當局設法調劑、便可防止其嚴重情勢之膨脹、况農民仍可如常安耕、其維持糧食較其他戰區為更有辦法也、若粵省則不然矣、粵省東西北江、已有多數縣屬被日軍佔領、秩序紊亂、交通梗塞、商不安業、農不安耕、若論及糧食問題、則異常嚴重、目前廣州米價、每國幣一元僅沽四斤半至五斤、淪陷區之佛山·陳村·大良·官山·九江·三水·其米價亦與廣州相埒、接連戰地之肇慶·江門·四邑、其榖米價值　較淪陷區較平、但每元亦僅購六斤半左右而已、北江方面之英德韶關、雖　藉</p>
<p>湘米輸入</p>
<p>惟北江上游大軍雲集、其所需糧食亦較其他區域為多、故其米價仍有貴無平、潮汕及東江、因有油厦口岸尚與香港交通、洋米可能源源輸運入口、但潮汕各屬每年缺乏米約三百萬、且米稅太貴、成本較昂、洋米接濟、亦殊不易、蓋廣東向為糧食欠缺之省份、在平常時代、亦靠大量之洋米輸入供給、茲值抗戰當中、沿海各口常被日艦封鎖或騷擾、以致洋米來源斷絕或短縮、更使全省陷於荒歉之狀態、近聞省府主席李漢魂、明令將原有之糧食委員會撤銷、改設全省糧食管理處、統籌辦理全省軍民糧食事宜、現值青黃不接、粵省餘米區域、旣被奸商購運一空、其他各區　又因交通梗阻、輸運困難　榖米價格日益騰貴、民間糧食又日益缺乏、深望有地方之責者、亟應解决此嚴重之問題、</p>
<h3>日艦駛高港　登陸未成</h3>
<p>泰縣通信、泰興高港八日上午由上游開來日艦一艘、停泊江中、十時許有日軍十數名在高港登陸　嗣因華軍戒備甚嚴、旋於十二時許仍回艦上、下午三時許該艦又移泊高港之西、但並無舉動、又揚州日軍、八日晨陸續開赴西山、共有日偽軍一百餘名、另有騎兵七八十名、九日轉向天長、六合增防、仙女廟日軍日前檢查郵件、竟將郵局寄往華方未淪陷區之郵件、多數扣留焚燬、</p>
<h3>蘇北形勢緩和　泗陽有克復訊</h3>
<p>南通偽軍一部反正</p>
<p>泰縣通訊、蘇北一帶日軍、迭次圖犯淮陰、均被華軍奮勇抵抗擊退未逞、連日日軍又圖南犯、迭次轟炸淮賣、至清泰長途電話、又為損壞、一時形勢忽趨緊張、一日又經華軍某部奮勇反攻、泗陽有已被華軍克復之說、清泰長途電話亦有已經修復、即可照常通話、故局勢又趨和緩、</p>
<p>蘇北游擊隊經顧祝同加以重行調整後、並調遺正規軍部隊參與、聲勢日益浩大、南通日前有偽軍三百名在四鄉紛擾、各村人民、懼其淫威、紛紛避難、詎該偽軍抵達金沙鎮時、被華軍游擊隊出其不意、予以襲擊、附近各鎮市部隊、亦據報開往應援、進行會攻、偽軍寡不敵衆、棄槍逃遁、未及逃出市鎮者均被擄、並有一部份偽軍反正投誠、高呼中華民國萬歲等口號、</p>
<h3>刦後之大江南北　江南文物多已成刦灰蘇北尚存一片乾凈土</h3>
<p>蘇省江南一帶自淪陷後、所受苦楚、散見各報、記者茲將各縣近况、　誌如次、</p>
<p>常熟景象</p>
<p>在江南方面的常熟、民間甚為殷富、普通家產在三萬以上十萬以下者、多至不以為奇、故城區所有因戰事而損燬的房屋等、已逐漸修復、工廠商店、亦次第復業、其間以布廠最盛、這種非正常的發展、係彼等在上海購買大批外紗、用汽車裝運至琴城、在日軍卵冀下、招工染織、然後運滬銷售、在常熟城區多至數十家、利息雖好、但因上海至常熟的運貨汽車、時遭游擊隊襲擊、使這般意圖大發國難財的商人、有一些戒懼、不然、常熟的工廠、將佔江南之　頭、同時常熟的「特貨」生意、因為暢吸無阻的緣故、也在畸形的發展中、</p>
<p>江陰現狀</p>
<p>江陰在常熟西北百里之處、濱江為城、民風古樸、農村副業、首推廠布、其貨目下運至滬上者、多銷售於寗紹、遠至南洋羣島一帶、運至江北者、銷售於通揚一帶、以及東台、　城、興化、各處、均有在東鄉沙洲一帶、出產棉花、往年每包價十二元左右、本屆雖告歉收、然棉價一倍於往年、更以育　無阻、故民間生活、不致恐慌、西鄉一帶、因農村副業之不發達、僅賴農產物及小本經營為活、故金融流動、較東鄉為遲滯、民間生活、亦因之苦澀、教育等事業、不及東鄉發達、目下江陰之城區、潛伏城中者、除偽組織中職員之若干商人外、事實上已成死城、</p>
<p>刦後常錫</p>
<p>蘇州無錫兩縣、夙稱工商發達之區、人民生活、平均較他處優裕、在無錫、目下除若干人在城廂閒廠設鋪以事蠅頭外、其他在鄉區略有田產者、多深居坐食、武進方面、其西北鄉一帶游擊隊、經過整編後、早有秩序、民間以販賣牛羊牲口為業者、亦多、至南鄉如滆湖以東一帶、米產著名、宜興城區駐有日軍、華軍則山之險為、戒備森嚴、澄錫武一帶商民、多有冒險至彼處收販米榖者、因利息較厚、故自去年迄今、途中來往不衰、彼等集中出口、大多在江陰屬之東鄉東萊鎮、轉運滬上、高淳北憑石　湖、南依固城湖之險、華方大軍雲集、候機出擊、</p>
<p>揚州相持</p>
<p>二十六年十二月十五日揚州淪陷、愛國之士、先後奮起、始終膠着於昭關壩、仙女廟一帶、民衆處於如此環境中、先後潛入各地、從事組織、而與城內偽方有關之各組織、逐漸掩旗息鼓、無形消散、至二十七年二月底、遂有大橋附近之激戰、現雙方仍在相持中、</p>
<p>通如近狀</p>
<p>二十七年三月十七日通城淪陷、至十九日如　繼續淪陷、日軍之攻南通、事實上並未發生十二分激烈之戰事、故屠殺焚燒、較江南各縣為次、由於南通失陷事件之發生、鄰縣為防患自身遭遇同樣情事計、故蘇北民氣遂為激昂、使現已侵入南通如　等處的日軍、僅能得一城區、未能有所發展、</p>
<p>靖江情况</p>
<p>靖江淪陷、該縣偽縣知事袁魯臣、因該縣遭華軍三面的威脅、而日軍防務並不十分鞏固、且城小　低、為自身茍安計、收編匪類百餘名、充為偽軍、靖江城離江邊八圩港十八里、均係石子馬路、八圩港駐有日軍數名至數十名、檢查行旅、目下江北黃橋·季家市·廣陵鎮一帶、不時發生游擊遭遇之小接觸、而日軍之來源、均係靖江出發、</p>
<p>泰縣人滿</p>
<p>各處一再遷避的難民、多　集在泰縣、據二十八年二月底的統計、在泰縣除已遣散之難民外、其他依活於難民所者、尚有九千餘人、故泰縣人口、在這一個時期中、突然增加三萬餘人、在街上人業中所聽到的口音、江南如武進·江陰·無錫·三縣者、為最多、他如丹陽·鎮江·常熟·的也在在多有、在泰縣以北、興化以南、千里週　的水套之中、充滿了無家可歸的人們、</p>
<p>蘇北民生</p>
<p>至於蘇北的人民生活、那就很簡單了、除掉少數城鎮裏的人、專事商業外、其他多數依苦力及農為生、在靠近江邊各縣的人民、有些在江南各縣業苦力、有些依小船來往各處、作小本生意、有些在家種田、其農產物如水灘之蘆柴、圓蘿蔔、大荳、黃荳等、米麥次之、其日常食品、如小米子、黃蘿蔔等、頗為簡單、在泰縣以北、興化以南、下河千里週　之水套中、民家多蓄　、因飼育較易、即滬上所銷之鴨蛋、多由彼處運來、去年三四月中、因天生港之閉塞、蛋類不能運出、下河一帶、產米甚豐、自揚州仙女廟發生戰事後、米市無形中移盛於　潼一帶、因下河一帶農產之豐盛、故人民生活較他處為優裕、因生活之優裕、故人民思想、均趨向於穩健、至　城東台一路、多有業　　者　因彼地雨量較稀、月河水中含有多量　質、苦澀難入口、故較殷富之戶、其　下均置大缸、以　雨水、而為飲料、此江北一帶大略之民生情形也、</p>
<h3>不日正式開航　汎美巨型機抵港</h3>
<p>能容七十二人座位有餐廳臥室等設備</p>
<p>香港通訊、汎美公司新裝波音式七十四客位巨型機、由美試航來港、途坎迭　風阻、至三日下得始由菲安然抵港、一時十分、在啟德機塲海面降落、本港官紳及中西士女前往參觀者極衆、查該機此次抵港、在太平洋航空史上、實增添一極有價值之一頁、其裝設之美備、佈置之華麗舒適、機身之龐大無倫、均堪稱為劃時代之作物、茲將該機抵港情形及其設備錄誌如下、</p>
<p>徐徐下降</p>
<p>該戶型機於三日晨七時三十九分、由小呂宋起飛、將到港時、突遇厚霧、不便於行、迫得後退、旋略見天清乃續航行到達香港上空、已下午一時矣、斯時、機塲電鐘大鳴、佇候於啟德沿岸之觀衆、知為機至、張目遠眺、而此空中怪物、已呈現於海面低空之上、為狀類魚、旋復沿海岸向西飛、環繞香島一週、然後降落、此時已二時十分矣、機靠海後、機上人員魚貫登陸、中外攝師、爭相拍攝、觀衆頻向機長致賀、四週滿佈歡躍空氣、</p>
<p>機長談述</p>
<p>記者在啟德碼頭上訪機長翹夫、據談沿途天氣頗佳、將近到港乃遇霧、平均每小時行一百六十哩、高度約八千尺、將近到港時、因遇霧曾折回、後方續航來港、七時三十分由馬尼拉起飛、如非遇霧、十一時半已抵達香港笑、查該機此次來港、並未載客、惟除機員外尚有技術人員、共廿四人該機定次日返美、廿三日即正式開航來港、</p>
<p>內部陳設</p>
<p>該機有甲板兩層、房間十八個、敷滿華麗地氈、四面有靠壁之梳化椅、華麗　備、儼如美國紐約公園路之富人住宅、裝上兩翼、放在空中飛行、沿着扶梯走進波音機、先踏上甲板、甲板原係供客人上落、但甲板之下為貯油池、裝油一千五百加倫、開橫門、下三級梯便是餐廳、面積橫十英尺半、直十二英尺、一切傢私器具、均有花色圖案、　壁為銀花色、裝有「活塊」窗廉、餐桌五張、十四人能同時用膳、餐廳如非用膳、可作為會談及消遣、同時該機如不走長途、改走短程、於旅客較多時、可將客廳改成睡室、邇時全機便可容載旅客四十人、餐廳前後有巷兩條、通入臥室、有臥室三個、容積橫為七英尺半、直十二英尺、高七英尺、房內有防音板之設、不虞機聲侵擾、前後之臥房、均可容十位客人、每個舖位有各自看書所用之電燈、通氣機、電鈴衣架等、並且均靠近可望外邊窗戶、船尾左邊有一間四人之臥房、歷邊是女客化裝室、門左有一個洗臉盆、一面大鏡子、冷熱水喉、和放刷牙用具之檯、靠着外邊有化裝檯兩列、再往後去到旅客部中最後部分、可到最聞名之「密月房間」、</p>

<h3>工部局因謠諑繁興　昨公表恊定內容　依據地產章程行使權力實際搜查由警務處執行</h3>
<p>外傳日憲兵在捕房設辦事處無稽　　工部局情報室公吿云、報界對於本局警務處與日本憲兵隊最近成立之妥恊辦去、頗有傳聞失實之處、本局有鑒於此、認爲宜將交涉經過、摘要公佈、</p>
<p>旣定方針　關於發生於公共租界以內之恐怖暴行、日本當道、曾與本局在二月二十二日與三月三日之間進行交涉、本局之態度、分述如下、（一）關於抗日之恐怖事件、本局已執行一九三八年七月十九日公佈之緊急辦法吿示、並準備繼續執行之、（二）除本局警務處以外之任何警務機關、在公共租界以內獨立行動之任何建議、非本局所能接受、本局依據地產章程所有之警務上之權力及責任、非經有關係各國認可、不得由本局移讓他人、惟本局曾謂日本憲兵隊及領事署警察在偵查恐怖行動方面與警務處之合作、固爲本局所準備繼續歡迎、任何合作之辦法、須在獲得本局警務處長同意、並與其商定以後實行、（三）在此次交涉開始以前、本局爲履行設法預防暴行之責任起見、已實行搜查由水道進入公共租界之人民、此種辦法、本局準備加緊實行、同時本局準備繼續邀請日籍便衣視察人員於搜查時到塲、（四）在本市政年度之內、本局已爲警務處之日籍組、新募警員四十五名、本局已設法自日本添募人員三十三名、俾將預算內所定額數補足、此節亦經本局說明、（五）本局會謂公共租界內各重要地點之搜查舉動、爲本局警務處之通常而繼續不斷之工作、現在此項工作、正在加緊實行中、</p>
<p>合作辦法　本局警務處長曾與日方官吏談話、以便擬定詳細辦法、將上述之合作一節、付諸實行、談話時曾决定下開各點、（一）關於搜查由水道進入公共租界之人民一節、本局警務處歡迎日本憲兵隊及領事署警察之合作、但實際上之搜查、必須由本局警務處實行、（二）日本當道如接得恐怖份子在租界以內某某地點之消息、並舉出具體之理由、而本局警務處認爲所舉之理由有充分之力量、足使本局在某某區域之內限制交通、以便實行搜查、則本局警務處準備如此合作、（三）日方建議在現有之刑事科組織以內、設一混合組、內有高級日籍警員一名、及經過選擇之日籍屬員數名、本局警務處長對於此項建議、準備給以有同情心之注意、所擬設之一組、必須與警務處現有之整個組織相合、並成爲警務處總部偵探股之一部份、受該股主任之指揮、此組之功用、在使日本當道於取締恐怖份子之工作方面有必要時、取得迅速之聯絡、（四）因恐怖事件拘獲之人犯、如其逮捕所根據之消息、係由日本當道供給者、日方如欲審問、本局警務處準備在大體上給以便利、但警務處保留按照案情個別處置之權、所有困難案件、將由兩警務機關討論、</p>
<p>某某數種報紙、曾謂日本憲兵隊將在本局警務處各捕房內設立辦事處、或謂日本憲兵將駐紮於本局警務處各捕房內云云、此項消息、並無根據、此外又有一種消息內稱警務處長已同意將華籍警員置於日本憲兵隊監督之下一節、亦屬子虛、</p>
<h3>日方擅捕華人　為政治性綁架　警務處事先完全不知日員絕不得自由行動</h3>

<h3>陳光甫</h3>
<p>繼任中行總栽不確　　日昨外傳中央銀行總裁有陳光甫繼任之說、昨記者特訪與陳氏接近者、據稱、陳氏近因患病、此次力疾赴美、正在休養之中、向任上海銀行總經理一職、現亦吿假、繼任中央總裁之說、殊非事實、]</p>
<h3>賑濟會勸阻　難民回籍</h3>
<p>儘量收容介紹職業　　黨警機關切實勸阻　　國府鑒於邇來各地由戰區逃出之難民、因日久旅居、生活困難、一般貧民、擬回籍度日、爲糾正此種錯誤思想起見、特飭由賑濟委員會切實勸阻、並設法予難民以生活上之安定、俾直接免除難民受淪陷區域之苦痛、間接爲抗戰前途之發展、現悉賑濟委員會奉令後、已擬定四項辦法、（一）各省市儘量設立收容所、收容由戰區逃出之難民、（二）由各省市政府辦理登記、從事難民職業介紹、（三）由各級黨部揭發淪陷區域之慘痛情形、俾衆知曉、（四）由各地軍警在各交通口岸、切實勸阻難民回籍、當經通函各省市分別轉飭遵行、</p>

<h3>偽市府　濫肆搜括</h3>
<p>又舉辦『商業登記』　　繳費後方可「保護」</p>
<p>偽「上海市政府」因四郊華軍游擊部隊活動異常、曾招添僞警數百、以資警備、惟因此經費感受不敷支配不得不另行設法彌補、乃由僞「社會局」訂立所謂「商業登記法暫行規則」三十四條、規定各種商業、均須向僞「警察局」登記、資本一千元者繳費一元、一萬元以內者二元、十萬元以內者五元、十萬元以上、每十萬加五元、登記納費後、方可「保護」、以故淪陷區各業，備受壓榨、莫不痛恨、</p>

<h3>滬市米價漸趨穩定　評價委會今日成立　取締暗盤交易查究投機操縱竭力疏通來源滬市民食無虞</h3>
<p>荳米業等七團體議决組織米糧評價委員會後、該委員會定今日下午二時、開首次會議、决依據前議限價、評定價格、米業市塲管理委員會已切實執行限價、取締暗盤交易、澈查投機操縱、昨日起、市塲價格、漸趨穩定、投機者業已漸斂跡、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>委員會議評定米價　荳米·米號·碾米·經售米糧業公會、暨運米客商聯益會·常熟公所·南帮公所·合組之米糧評價委員會、昨日已由荳米業指定之召集人符前耕、通知各委員、定今日下午二時、在漢口路上海商社、舉行首次委員會、宣吿成立、並决依據前定限價、即頭號白米不得超過十四元、一評定上海米價、中次照別、嗣後各客行號方面、必須遵照此評定價格辦理、惟買賣之佣金得另加、每石爲一角二分，</p>
<p>取締暗盤查究操縱　荳米業市塲管理委員會、已切實執行十四元限價、並取締暗盤之非法交易、澈查囤積投機操縱、如有查獲違犯上項情事、决呈報公會、予以制裁、同時運米客商聯益會已勸吿各販米商人、竭力設法疏通來源、應顧全大局、維持民食、切勿因產地米價高漲而停販、聞各行號販商等已允彼此合作、共維滬市民食、並使市塲價格穩定、</p>
<p>市場米價漸趨穩定　昨日起，荳米市塲、因經各米業團體之切實執行限價、所以一般投機者漸斂跡、囤戶深恐被查獲處分、故有一部份依照限價出售、於是市塲價格、漸趨穩定、暗盤交易、遂漸减少、至於近日到貨、較上星期已增加、每日約有五六千包、目前滬市存底據估計、總約六十萬包左右、足供三個月之需、所以整個民食、暫時决無缺乏之虞、將來即靑黃不接之時、亦不致十分嚴重、</p>

<h3>滬效戰况嚴重　滬西「綏靖軍」撤退浦南華軍開始合圍</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨日（十三日）據華方與日方消息稱、於七日來、上海區曾連續發生激戰、作戰人數頗衆、此爲證實上屋期所傳上海區大部份俱有游擊隊加緊活躍之說、最臨近市區之發生戰事地爲虹橋、華方勁强面分散之正規軍、自午夜至昨日拂曉、在該區中向日駐軍進擊、旋卽引退、秩序井然、</p>
<p>毫無損失　日軍發言人昨晚招待各報記者時雖稱、渠未得虹橋戰事之消息、並謂渠以爲並無戰事發生云云、但據向虹橋居民探悉、自午夜開始、直至晨間七時未息之槍聲、决非「打靶」性質、昨日午後、虹橋其居民語記者云，雙方必均曾用機關槍射擊、渠且信攻擊時曾一度使　　用手榴彈　由此可知兩軍相距必甚近、據華方消息、此次襲擊、尤注重於進擊近抵上海之「大道綏靖軍」、此乃自南京派來之漢奸隊伍、用以接代不勝困擾之日駐軍者、昨晚日軍發言人一一報吿上星期內、發生之戰事、</p>
<p>復爲證實　華方近傳上海區游擊隊活躍之消息、至於傷亡方面、華方與日方之詳報、雖各有不同、但參加交綏軍隊之衆多、實表示戰事之性質嚴重無疑、據日軍發言人昨晚聲稱、日軍與華方非正規軍一千人</p>
<p>激戰終日　已於星期五日佔據浦東之南滙、戰事開始、因有活動於南滙東北區之游擊隊二百人、於星期五日拂曉開始向南滙移動、時南匯亦有游擊隊三百人、日軍列陣進攻時、復有游擊隊五百人、自南滙迤南約六公里之大團出發進擊、日軍與之接戰後、復向南滙進攻、而於午後四時佔據之、發言人極言　　日軍損失　爲死一人、傷三人、星期六日晨、日軍與華軍一隊約二百人、在南滙東南二十公里之坦直橋作戰、發言人稱、日軍無傷亡、上星期二日九時、日軍在奉賢迤南十公里處與游擊隊約三百人交綏、上海迤西之靑浦白河港（譯音）附近、上星期五日亦有戰事、同日崇明島亦起戰事、發言人續稱、</p>
<p>駐蘇州區　之日軍、於一月二十一日至二月二十日、與華軍及游擊隊共作戰六十一次、日軍死十一人、傷十九人、另有活躍於句容·丹陽·之華方游擊隊約七百人、本月六日起、與日軍作戰、迄今戰事仍在進行中、此輩華軍隸屬新四路軍、携有臼砲等軍器、</p>
<p>日軍增防　現代社云、滬西區近因時聞槍聲、故日軍恐懼異常、特加派大批兵士、前往增防、分駐於星加坡路公大紗廠·勞勃生路喜和紗廠·以及豐田紗廠內、除在四週設置鐵絲網外、並加築守望台及防禦砂袋堡壘等、殊形忙碌、其惶惶不安之狀、益徽泥足深陷而不可自拔、</p>
<p>滬西現狀　英文大美晚報云、前（十二日）晚游擊隊活躍之虹橋區、今日已恢復和平與安謐、「綏靖軍已於昨日調離該區、而由日軍與，大道警察」接替駐防該地、</p>
<p>浦南反攻　據浦南來人談、奉松一帶、自天氣放晴後、戰事擴大、日軍由浦北閔行松江等處一帶、隔江增援、企圖將南橋莊行盛梓廟亭林後岡松隱東西綿長四十里、聯成一綫、保持離浦江深入二十里之據點、再圖向東南推進、此處游擊隊與正規軍配合、連日作大規模之反攻、砲火連天、浴血挺進、已將日軍截成三段、緊緊包圍、南橋克復、亭林日軍、退路已斷、處境危險、後岡日軍、全部退回松隱、故後岡又入華軍之手、雙方損害情形、尙難查明、</p>
<h3>日籍稅警　逮捕登岸旅客　謀福輪上青年搭客被認為「抗日份子」</h3>
<p>德商禮和洋行謀福輪、十日下午一時許、由甬開抵滬埠、泊於金利源碼頭、當有靑年男客一人、均西裝革履、頭冠大帽、一着黃呢大衣、房艙搭客、定海沈家門人、一着人字呢大衣、名仇阿華、於離輪登岸時、先後遭江海關日籟稅警攔截、肆意搜索、當在黃衣旅客懷中、抄出抗日自衛會信封一只、在仇姓旅客身上、搜出購書單一紙、單上所列、均爲抗戰書籍、致遭日警仇視、認係「抗日份子」、加以逮捕、該定海籍旅客、當由江海關某高級職員具保釋出、仇阿華則被解送日方軍部、查仇年廿五歲、鄞南橫溪人、曾留學日本二月、因抗戰發生回國、此次由甬赴滬、竟遭非法逮捕、其生命安全、至堪系念、</p>

<h3>西南旅程瑣記（上篇）</h3>
<p>— 殼厂</p>
<p>軍興以後，西南各省，已變成我們抗戰建國的田園，全國的樞紐。關於西南各處的記載，散見於報章或雜誌的，已實在不少，但是現在這個局面，一切的一切，沒有一樣不是一天一天的演變着，所以要想有一種確實能够帮助旅行者作爲參考的記載，眞是千難萬難，不易下筆的。昨天忽有服務某旅行機關的友人，新自西南各處考查返滬，報吿了他一路上的情形，以及現在去西南應有的一切經騐，不但是最近的報道，比較的切於事實；而且將實際上所應曉得的常識，本着他得到的經騐，說的非常澈透。我想這種報吿，不但比較普通的抵記載路程，及沿途情形的作品要好得多，而且這種實際上的經騐，也是大多數人所需要知道的。以下便是友人的報吿：　　去年九月二十一日自香港出發，先到梧州，港梧交通，有輪船可通，頗極便利。（自廣東陷落，此路即行停航，但是日後大局恢復，此綫必仍是由港入桂的交通要道）船上設備很好，膳食也還可口。梧州城廂市街，到也相當的齊整，那時候因爲常常有空襲的警報，所以日間的市面，反不如晚上來得熱鬧。桂省的人民全是短衣布鞋，並且全是赤脚，就是訪客酬應，也是如此，這種敦摩儉樸的民風，實在令人可敬。梧州的食宿，還能對付，淸潔衛生，尙不能普及。梧州的汽車站在戎墟，是梧州對江的一個市鎭，往來渡江，用的是電船，一個多小時就可以到達，到也相當的便利。</p>
<p>二十五日黎明，由梧州出發往柳州去，到了戎墟，就買票登車，車座全編有號碼，旅客可以對號入座，能買着票就可以有坐位，這個辦法，是非常之好。這段路的路面很平坦，當天的晚上，就到了鬱林，這是梧柳間的宿站，旅客們要離車到旅館去住宿的。但是旅客們離車後，所有車上的行李，車站上是不負責仟的，要你自己去管理；而且在離車後，還要到車站去登記明天再坐車的號碼。這種種的手續，對於單身的旅客，頗是不便，所以單身客人，行李千萬要少帶。次早的七點鐘開車，中途在容縣午飯，下午六時就到了柳州　　柳州當局對於檢查行李，非常嚴厲。同行的有學生數人，因爲帶了一副撲克牌，預備作旅途上的消遣，不料被檢出後，認爲是賭具，雖然加以解說，終歸無效，結果罰了二十元。所以入桂的旅客，萬不可帶類此的消遣具，免得受罰。</p>
<p>柳州分爲南北兩岸，所有的市面，全在北岸，就是柳州城，也設在北岸，但是汽車站設在南岸的。因爲便利旅客起見，在車站附近，雖然也設有旅店和食館，但是仍就沒有北岸來得熱鬧，至於整個市面的情形，是不如梧州繁盛的。</p>
<p>梧州和柳州兩處的房屋，很是特別，所有的墻上，都有鐵鈎子釘牢，我初一看時，很莫明其妙，後來向當地人一打聽，才曉得梧柳兩地常常會有大水的，等到大水一到，房屋就要沒在水內，居民進出，全要坐船，並且是自窗戶中出入。這種鐵鈎子，就是預備發水時依靠船隻和攀據出入用的。</p>
<p>由柳州到貴陽的車票，購買很不容易，我本來想在二十八日動身，結果竟會延遲到十月一日才買到了票，自柳州出發。</p>
<p>自柳州北上的公路，是屬於西南公路局的，第一餐站到了宜山，旅客們正好進膳。此地有浙江大學，又因爲蔣百里先生在此病歿，所以很爲出名。宜山特約食堂，是中國旅行社承辦的，菜蔬烹調，很是可口，聽說此地的鷄很賤，猪肉則不多。飯後車開，當天晚上就到了河池，—中途第一偭宿站。河池雖然也是一個縣份，但是僅僅的有一條直街，竟連個縣城全沒有，還不如江南鄕鎭上熱鬧呢！這條街呌鳳儀街，是土做成的，中國放行社設立的河池招待所，就在這條街上，離車站不過半里路，所設備的棕棚臥床，所以說是內地絕無僅有的惟一舒適床舖。尤其使我念念不忘的，就是招待所裏還有沐浴設備，洗一次澡，僅花了二角大洋，可是一路征塵，就因此而大减其疲憊了</p>
<p>十月二日早上離了河池，中途用膳是在六寨，飯後再走，晚上可以到獨山。由六寨到獨山的一段公路，可以說是西南公路中最惡劣的一段，一路之上，顚簸不堪。獨山是柳州貴陽間的第二個宿站，當地可沒有一個好一些的旅館，幸而有中國旅行社在恊安旅社內設了十幾個改良鋪位，才可以勉强的住宿，可惜舖位太少，並不敷旅客們的需要。</p>
<p>第二天在獨山出發，先到馬塲坪，這個地方是西南公路東路和南路的一個會合食站。旅行社特的當地東南旅舍所辦的食堂，膳菜可算得全路上最好的了，我在此處得到了一個滿意的午餐，當天的下午五時，達到了貴陽。</p>
<p>貴陽是貴州的省會，現在又算客貨運的樞紐，交通的重心，所以西南公路運輸管理局的總局，也設在此處。貴州素來是以貧瘠見稱的，但是自從軍興之後，各地的商民來黔的日多，所以市面上已較以前好的多了。當地的旅館，設備全都很　　，祗有省政府委託旅行社在城內棉花巷街省立圖書館隔壁辦的貴陽招待所，環境最佳，設備最好，所差的也是房間不多，住客常要向隅。</p>
<p>十月十二日自筑出發，首途赴渝。第一天在烏江渡吃午飯，烏江渡的水流非常之急，公路汽車也須要用船渡過去，我們渡江的時候，因爲是秋天，所以水勢還平，並沒有什麽危險，聽說要到了春天，那水就要湍急萬分，渡江時的危險性，是非常之大。晚上到了桐梓住宿，桐梓雖然是個小地方，但是因爲這是周西成先生的故里，所以也有電燈的設備。旅行社在此也辦了一個招待所，佈置的非常潔凈完美，並且還預備一種中菜式的西菜，吃了別饒風味。</p>
<p>第二天早晨出發，不久已入了四川境，中午在松坎午膳，飯後再登車上路，這晚就要停留在綦江了。綦江這個地方，可簡陋極了，尋了半天，也尋不出一個好些的旅館，後來就在一個比較大點的旅館停下來，那兒的臥床，是用竹板做成的，上面舖塊草荐，也沒有枕頭。一條棉被是又狹又短，一塊綫毯，是又破又髒，還沒有閉上眼，蚊子臭虫已竟相繼來犯。在旅途勞頓之後的人們，要是得不到好好的睡眠，那是多們苦啊，我在這無法可想的環境下，乃想出一個消極抵制的辦法來，到外面買了幾張大桐油紙舖墊在下面，以禦臭蟲、又用大被單一條、連頭帶足的蓋在上面、以制蚊子。居然就道樣子安睡一夜，未遭襲擊。由此經騐，可以看出來，現在出門到內地，一條大被單，兩張桐油紙，是不可少的伴侶呀！</p>

<h3>寒氣之功</h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>天寒地凍，冰雪載途，給纊無溫，墮指裂膚，樹木、花卉、田禾、以至一切飛禽走獸，不免凍斃，人類亦有受寒而疾病死亡者，故多歸咎寒氣之爲害。然就動物進化之一方面觀之，寒氣實有莫大乏功。</p>
<p>（一）熱血之動物因此而出現大約距今以前二萬萬年左右（中生代），爬蟲類甚多，共身體亦偉大，各種之恐龍及能飛之爬蟲，即其代表。地球發生極大之變動，冰河出現，溫度之下降極低，各種大爬蟲生活發生困難，遂輾轉絕滅。而其中有善於適應環境之種類，因寒氣過勝之故，體中之新陳代謝竟能增加其速度，體溫上昇，漸由冷血而變爲熱血，得以維持其生命之活潑，不致殭萎枯斃。因身體之活動矯健，不甘受地面上寒氣之侵陵，始則將其身體抬高，離去地面，不似一般爬蟲以腹部近距地面之姿態。由此演進不已，經過長久之年代，乃有烏類與哺乳類之出現。</p>
<p>（二）動物之行動因此而進化六千餘萬年以前（新生代）之哺乳類，其身體重大，行動遲滯者，如大犰狳，大樹樹，大象等，在溫和氣候中可以生活。在此時代之中，冰河出現四次，嚴寒威脅，視前此爲尤甚，行動遲滯之動物竟遷避不及，相率凍斃，至於絕種。而其時亦有身體較小，行动較捷，如駱驼、犀牛、象、馬等可以脫險無恙，積久進化，遂有今日之種類。</p>
<p>（三）人頹之文化因此而肇端知人猿向祖之說，乃科學上之事實，無容異議。當最新時期（Pleocen　epoch），人類已出現於世，與他靈長類（Primates，猿猴與人，皆厲此類）之生活初無少異，居於森林之中，大率爲樹上之生活。後因大地地上之森林爲冰河所摧毁，靈長類圖避嚴寒，由北向南遷徙而冰河亦由北而南。迨森林區盡行消滅，原始之人類被迫而放棄森林之生活，汲汲尋覓何者可以爲食，何者可以爲衣，以免飢寒之交迫，以期戰勝自然而不爲氣候所困。處身於冰天雪海之中，環境之威脅愈甚。人類既由靈長類演化而出，高於一切猿類，其天賦之智慧，至是不得不盡量施用。其智慧因施用愈甚，愈形進化，始則發明火之功用，以减寒氣之侵迫，繼則能驅役各種動物，食其肉，衣其皮，以增加抗寒之能力，且更進而駕驶自然，產生原始之文化。</p>
<h3>從跑馬照相說到有聲影片</h3>
<p>— 旦</p>
<p>據說在一八七一年時，有一位美國加利福尼亞州的參議員，名呌斯旦福特的，和人賭個東道，說是一隻正在快跑的馬，沒有一個時候會四足一齊離地的。另有一個英國人，名呌默勃立巨，他就在跑馬道的邊上，一段段地放了許多照相機，利用電的接觸，把這跑過的馬，照下像來。他證明正在跑着的馬，老是一足着地。這件事就指示出活動影片的可能性。</p>
<p>在一八八〇年，默勃立巨在舊金山造成了一種「獸片盤」，能把玻瑙正片上的圖盡映射到一張幕上。後來他就和愛迪生商議，把他自己的獸片盤和留聲機合作。至一八八三年他在外國，常和法國學院的馬蘭討論此事。</p>
<p>馬蘭是第一個使用連續膠片的人，雖然使連續膠片遠到現在這樣完美的程度，必須歸功於美國的依司德門。</p>
<p>在一八九三年羅米亞造出了第一架膠片放映機。至一八九六年愛迪生也發明了他的活動映片機。這些機器，就是今日已經大加改良過的電影機的模範。</p>
<p>最初的電影是無聲的，情節以及劇中人的對白，都以字幕來表示。伹當時的人都相信，無聲電影祗是一種過渡中的產物，有磬的影片，是一定以期望得到的。</p>
<p>有聲電影也是由逐漸的改良而來。起初祇是音樂的陪奏，後來在影片中穿插進一二支的歌曲或一段演說，最後才有全部聲白的影片。</p>
<p>這些有聲影片是如何造成的呢？方法有二：有一種是很容易明白的，因爲牠就是利用我們所熟悉的留聲機。這種方法的困難點，就在如何使留聲機機轉動的速度和膠片的速度完全一致。經過了許多的研究和實騐，這個問題被解决了。方法是這樣的：用一個或數個微音器，使聲波把電流起了漲落的變化。這由微音器出來隨聲音漲落的電流，則引入一組眞空管放大器，把牠放大到足以驅動錄音機。然後以此電流導入錄音機，變成了機械的振動，而錄音於一塊軟蠟的圓盤上。照片機和置蠟盤的轉臺，是被兩架同步交流電動機所驅動，自始至終速度相等，因此動作和聲白完全合拍。</p>
<p>在放映電影時，這蠟盤就放在一架連於映片機而被同一電動機所驅動的轉臺上，留聲機唱片和影戲膠片同時開始發動。當針在蠟盤的凹槽中經過時，使一塊小磁鐵振動，造成一脈微弱的電流，其漲落情形和在攝片時微昔器中的電流一般。這電流再經放大而導入一攝聾器，因此和原來一般的聲音就發出來了。以上所述，即係「維他風」法。</p>
<p>另一種方法是以聲音記錄於連續膠片邊上之法，就是所謂「慕維通」式。在這種方法中，如第一法一般，先在微音器中把聲音的振動，變成電流之漲落而放大之。然後把這巳放大的電流，導入一只輝光放電眞空管，其發光的强弱，依所導入電流之漲落而定。這變化的光，經過了一條狭隙後，被一組透鏡焦集於膠片的邊上。所以當膠片冲洗後，非但顯出一組景物的照片，並且兩邊還一有組同時的聲音的照片。這種聲音照片是一連串濃淡不同或長短不一的綫條，就相當於被微音器所放之聲音。</p>
<p>用這種方法來放映有聲電影時，把膠片穿過一架配有發聲附件的影片映射機。在這附件中有一道光射過了膠片邊上記錄過聲音的那一部分，而由此出來的光的强度和頻率，則依音跡而變化。這變動的光綫，射在一隻能感光而發電的奇器，叫做光電管上，於是管中發生相當於原來聲音的漲落電流。這電流經放大後，導入一架貼近銀幕背後的强力揚聲筒，而發出和影片中動作合拍的聲音來。</p>
<h3>紐約世界博覽會中的跳傘塔</h3>
<p>— 鴛</p>
<p>人人得而嘗試</p>
<p>現在是航空術躍進的時期，各國對於航空事業提倡不遺餘力。</p>
<p>嘗試降落傘的塔即在給予初習飛行者以一些乘傘絰騐，已漸爲航空界所採用。因此萬國降落傘練習會特在此次世界博覽會中建造一座跳傘塔，以使參觀者得有一個嘗試的機會，藉以引起大衆的注意。</p>
<p>航空員在傘未張開時，自飛機突然躍落，須靠充分的經騐。該塔當然已將跳傘正常的一切危險减至極小，也無需教導乘客如何拉動繩索，或撥動機關，使傘自動張開等手續。</p>
<p>塔上所備的傘直徑三十二呎，由一個金屬大環將它恒久張開。嘗試者縛身於縣在傘下的雙人坐位上，極穩妥舒適。把一個機關撥動，傘即下降。傘降落時，因邊緣有垂直的鋼索　限，不致擺盪。更因一種吸收振動的特別裝置，降落時絕無衝動之苦。傘抵地面後，可以再拉至塔頂，供另一人嘗試。</p>
<p>塔上共備傘十一頂，均隨時可用。上昇或下降一次約费時一分半鐘。嘗試者雖不能盡得飛機跳伞的經驗，但是至少可以得一種新奇的經騐，並得在二百五十呎高空俯瞰全塲一次。該塔全部重一百七十磅，不過它的搆造極巧，可以卸下往別處再行試用。</p>

<h3>大小兩便</h3>
<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>要說的是大便與小便，咳眞是臭文章！</p>
<p>從前有一位自命才子的吟成七個宇：遠看城牆如鋸齒，就自以爲了不得，因此想起古人之中只有顏淵同他一樣，於是又想到了短命而痛哭起來。鬧得鄰人跑來問明了原委，就寬慰他道，顏淵是下路不通才漲死了的，足下邊放得出好屁，决無性命之憂。</p>
<p>無論大便不通或小便不通，超過某種程度以上，的確有送命的危險，所以大小兩便對於人生殊關重要，現在把科舉對於兩便的認識，隨便談談。我們以爲大便總是吃進去的東西變的，不錯，可是沒有說全，而且不免要引起誤會。試問問幾位助產女士，她們可以告訴你，剛出世的小孩子，往往就拉出一堆大便。這糞是從堕裏帶來的，故名胎糞。胎兒在娘肚中，没有吃過黄米青菜，更談不到歐美大菜，這糞是胎兒本身的東西變的。所以如果把話說全，就該說，一部份大便来自外入的食物，另一部份大便來自内在的東西。我們再考慮一下，就不至於誤會所有吃進去的東西都變成大便出來，因爲這樣我們等於白白的吃了進去。小孩吃奶是要長肉的，完全變了大便如何能一天一天的大起來。大便最惹厭的就在那種特殊的木　香味。我們不由得要問，吃進香的去，拉出臭的來，究竟在什麼地方變的？原來經過腸道時，繼消化之後而來的就是腐化，這化與那化，原則上本無多大的區別，在吃草的動物，腐化是有助於消化的。然而腐化却產生臭的東西，因之通人要掩鼻而嘆了。不過得聲明一點，糞中某種臭東西在純淨狀態時卻帶茉莉花香，生髮水中有的還用到牠。現在我們得招呼小便了。試把人體看作一隻燒煤的火爐——這是不通的鑒喻，然而倒還合用——那麼，烟筒與火爐下面的門合起來就是肺，燒得半焦而含有碎石的煤塊權充大便，燒得無可再燒而遺留下來的灰燼就是小便了。走過「不許小便」而偏多小便地方的通人，又要哼着臭而不可聞也的老調，可是這已非小便本色。小便在剛剛出来的時候，饒有新煮的肉湯香味，諸位不信，請互相比較一下。我國舊時有飲童便之法，不知當時何所根據，現在知道小便之中（不必是童便），在某種情形下除了灰燼之外，尚含其他有關健康的寶貴東西，譜名曰荷爾蒙，可說是摩登補品，與維他命有同樣的風頭。所以喫喫小便，雖免不了帶點舊氣，但只要喫得恰到好處，倒也無傷大雅。</p>
<p>話匣子終須結束；大小兩便的內容既以殘煤與灰燼爲主體，就知道出路不暢必至妨害燃燒，出路阻塞必使火爐熄滅。不是有名的顏淵也因了下路不通而短命的嗎？可是得鄭重聲明，這是才子的鄰人說的。</p>

<h3>埋藏現代歷史</h3>
<p>— 玉尚</p>
<p>留給五千年後的考古學家</p>
<p>行將開幕的一九三九年紐約世界博覽會爲了把現代生活的確實記錄，即代表現時代的各種物品，保存五千年起見，已在威斯丁好斯陳列大厦的下面，五十英尺深處，埋藏着一種用特殊材料製成的紀念管。其外殼重八百磅，係用一種銅合金，呌做克勃洛依（Cupaloy）的製成。</p>
<p>各種紀念物品——連製造克勃洛依的方劑在內——都封藏在一個六英尺長的內管裏。此管用耐热玻璃製成，管內空氣抽盡，换装入鈍性氣體做防腐劑。封閉後，用玻璃帶裹好，覆以防水材料：然後放進克勃洛依外管內，再將外管封閉周密。</p>
<p>克勃洛依合金係由銅，鉻和少量銀製成，硬與銅等，是威斯丁好斯電器公司的科學家經五年研究而得的結果。這些研究家發見于銅鉻中混銀能增加銅和鉻的強度。他們相信此種外殼可抵抗渗入紐約地基中的海水之侵蝕歷五千年之久。銅一經被蝕，即被覆着一層護膜，可防止內部的金屬不再受海水侵蝕。科學家認爲此種銅合金內的鉻之存在，可增加這種膜的保護效能云。</p>

<p>臭汗也有用途</p>
<p>人體內排出的臭汗現在工業界也有用處了。人脂酸是人體臭汗中的重要成分，現在科學家正在把它綜合起來成爲一種用途極廣的重要原料，可以製軟化劑使樹脂可塑質軟化，又可以製一種新樹脂以產生一種遠勝於普通人造絲的纖維。羊脂酸是和山羊體上的臭汗有關，像人脂酸和人體的關係一樣，近來自被綜合而成爲一種工業上的原料後，也已有不少重要用途。</p>

<h3>送「投筆從戎」的學生</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>本市復旦大同各大學的十幾位學生，已經在前天動身往內地去服務了。他們眞做到了「投筆從戎」道一步。</p>
<p>然而我們知道，班定遠「投筆從戎」的動機，是「立功異域，以取封侯」，完全着重在個人利益，而我們現在出發的諸君，則完全着重在國家民族的獨立與自由，比較起來，自然現在的「投筆從戎」，更有意義了。我們對於班定遠，尙且屢屢艷稱，認爲少年有志，那末，對於這十幾位學生，服務國族，我們又那得不向之鄭重致敬，祝他們早日凱旋呢！</p>
<p>我不認識這十幾位忠勇靑年，他們在上海的生活環境怎樣，我也不知道。但是報上說，他們都是「富家子弟」，這一點，更引起了我的無限敬崇。</p>
<p>在上海的「富家子弟」，我也看見過不少。大概說來，他們的態度浮滑；他們出入於舞塲妓院；他們不讀書，即使在學校，也不過虛應故事；他們不知道天下國家，只知道醇酒婦人；他們不是有爲的靑年，而是宗法社會的渣滓，公子哥兒；他們簡直不是人，而是行屍走肉！………我對他們完全絕了望，以爲中國與其要擁有這一批寶貝，還不如——恕我說不出這句話。</p>
<p>現在，我們這十幾位「富家子弟」總算爲他們的同等地位者，掙了一口氣，使我從絕望當中，復生了希望。因此，在我個人，我更其感激這十幾位的靑年。我更要向之鄭重致敬，祝他們早日凱旋。</p>
<p>時代的激盪，還在不息地進行着，聞風興起的，總還大有人在吧！　　我並不一定主張所有在上海的靑年學生，都要像這十幾位一樣，到內地去爲國宣勞——假使大家都肯這樣，當然最好——，但我以爲每一個有頭腦的靑年學生，都可以自己想想，要不要走上這條光榮的大路；如果要的，希望他會不顧一切，馬上就走！如果不要的，那末在上海也當過着嚴肅的生活，而另尋報國之途，不要糊塗下去，糜爛下去！</p>
<p>這十幾位是今年動身的第一批。我願意用我的禿筆，不久就能再送這樣的第二批第三批，以至第無數批。</p>
<h3>黎明之歌</h3>
<p>— 黎晨</p>
<p>在蜿蜓着的羣山中，公路忽高忽低的從牠們身上爬過：曲折的河流正跟它相交，構成了一片小的平原。</p>
<p>要問那歲月，正是暴風雨之後的幾個月。在死亡和寒冷的脅迫下，這裏是找不出一點生命的氣息來了。近處遠處的邨莊，都變成灰燼。立在橋上，可以一無阻礙的望到遠處；赤裸裸的原野，寂然的展開着。野路，正象徵着死滅的恐怖，向遙無邊際的遠方伸長，仲長。</p>
<p>在高架着鐵絲網的橋邊，出現着的，是兩個木偶似的兵士。爲了破除岑寂，矮胖的一個正胡亂地哼着歌兒；另一個瘦長身子的立在一邊，兩隻眼睛像老鼠一樣的溜動着。　　「拿你的槍來跟我比比看！」</p>
<p>矮胖的他忽然高聲命令着。對面一個人却像從夢裏醒來似的，慢吞呑取下他的槍枝。</p>
<p>「嘿嘿，比我的短一寸多呢！」兩枝槍放在一起，他那臃腫的身軀像醉漢似的亂動着。接着，他「勝利」地笑了：「哈哈，亡國奴的槍還有好的麽？」</p>
<p>這被侮辱着的人苦悶地皺了皺眉，繼而他就想到家。　　「嘻嘻，亡國奴的槍……」　　　笑聲又貪婪地響起了。</p>
<p>他終於又打定了主意。他覺得這是一個很好的機會，當他看見了那個驕橫的臉和身上的短槍之後。</p>
<p>「砰！」</p>
<p>正像一個飽滿的車胎放完了氣，驕傲的食婪者的結果是永遠僵直的躺在地上！</p>
<p>夕照在翠藍的晴空染上了各色的雲彩。在緋紅的陽光下，懶懶的躺着的大地蒙上了一層暗影。瘦長的人擎着兩桿「德國製」的長槍，健步地走下橋來。</p>
<p>「下去！」大皮靴用力一踢，矮胖的軀體骨碌碌的滾下河去，於是他哼着：</p>
<p>我覺得我應該這樣做，父母，妻子，…全家的死。怎能阻擋我！死去的曠野，醒來吧！春天正等着你們醒來的呵欠！這正是黎明的前夜。不去迎接就將、永遠錯過！</p>
<p>他已經跨上山坡，發着靑光的雙眼眺望着遠處，「翻過那個山頭，就是游擊隊的司令部了吧！」他想。</p>
<p>垂垂夜色，從四面合攏來，大地更顯得沉寂了。然而他並不孤獨，因爲勝利的歌唱正伴着他行進。</p>
<p>半點鐘前，他還是大地的蟊賊；而現在呢？他已經是大地的保姆了！</p>

<p>可是現在有些人，却不研究這些，並且更其違反了這些說話的要件，非但不會惹「禍」，一樣可以成爲「名流」，「學者」，或者某界的「大亨」。畢竟「後來居上」，古人的不及今人，恐怕正在這一點吧。</p>
<p>有某名流，當其未得意時，每逢公衆集會，不問來人有多少，是誰，討論些什麽，他一定要登臺，或立起來發言。有時他的話，滔滔不絕，可以說上一二小時，使人有摸不着頭腦之妙，然而有時却又簡單異常，只有這樣的幾句：「今天兄弟很高興，可以和諸位見面。今天兄弟很高典，可以和諸位見面。」</p>
<p>他的膽子很大，甚至在歐美人的集會中，他也會道貌岸然地登臺或立起來，用着莊重而有力的口吻，一再說着：「Ladies　and　Gentiemen　Ladies　and　Gontlemen。」說了幾遍，並無下文，就此一鞠躬，或者點點頭，坦然走下麥來或坐下來。</p>
<p>據說，這樣到處發言的人很不少，雖然有的要比這位名流高明些，果然也還說得流暢些，或者有一些意思在內。至於他們的目的是什麽，我想大家總也猜得到吧，無非要鑽出頭來罷了。</p>
<p>其實鑽出頭來，方法也有多端，不一定要這樣的「必言」。這可以說是硬派，另外還有一種使人不知不覺間就會信服他的軟派。軟派的「必言」是這樣！</p>
<p>在甲先生地方，一定說到那地位，名譽，聲勢與甲先生相仿的乙先生並且似乎很隨使地說出乙先生與自已有什麽親密的往來，或共同辦事，或促膝談心，或同作某項消遣。在乙先生地方，自然儘可堂皇地說，方才在甲先生地方，如何如何過，天花亂墜，寶雨繽紛，都是題中應有之文章。同樣在丙先生以至X先生地方，都可以一以貫之，運用道樣「必」之「言」。久而久之，這些先生們就都會當他是「某翁」，「某兄」，「自己人」，或「極熟的人」了；妙處不可言傳，其鑽出頭來也必矣。</p>
<p>不過軟派的工夫，要比硬派艱難些，雖然軟派的成功速而大。他不能再像硬派那樣「語無倫次」或者「不着邊際」。他必須於態度從容，賣相甚好之外，有婉轉的辭令，可以博得對談者的歡心。他必須三敎九流，諸子百家，都有一些「三脚猫」，說出來似乎頭頭是道，所謂像煞有介事那樣。否則開口見喉嚨，對面的某先生也者，就要「另眼看待」了。</p>
<p>但是軟派和硬派，仍舊有一個共通之點，作爲「必言」的先鋒，那就是面皮老。「膽大老面皮，天下去得」，此之謂也。</p>
<p>「夫人不言，言必有中」；「言必稱堯舜」；「言必信」，「必言」倒過來成了這樣的「言必」，才會眞正天下太平吧！</p>
<h3>深夜獨語</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>生活，敎養把我塑成一個有幾分矜持的人，以此招來無數長長的陰暗的日子。快樂的門，像是永爲我關閉着，從未尋到開啟樂園的鑰匙。在感傷的陰影裏，獨自過度着，童年的天地點綴得非常冷寂。</p>
<p>常有一絲哀愁種在心田的深處，一抺憂鬱鎖在　魂的堂奧，但我永遠嚴密的封藏着，防止別人的窺視。其實却是替別人着想的。我深知快樂雖不易分享，哀鬱倒頗能感染。那麽，爲何要增人忉怛呢？</p>
<p>靜靜的子夜，我沉思默想，終於揭開記憶的錦匣，像是一個豪客，把玩着過往的珠寶，可惜大都黯然無彩，沒有奪目的光芒。翻檢又翻檢，終不免一聲太息，悄悄地收起。</p>
<p>到了暮年，快走到人生盡頭的時候，溯望着來的道路竟是如此荒凉落寞，該是多麽可悲呢？我想。旣沒在風暴中打過滾，又未在烽火中出入過，僅陷於個人的泥沼，翻個把觔斗，人世竟是如此平凡，一生就這麽完了？我問。</p>
<p>達觀論者說：「世界是一個舞台，人生是一幕戲劇。」但我却不同意於這說法。命運是揑在我們自已手心裏的，人們並非註定該扮那類角色。可是我又常被痛苦所毀滅，挨着時光的磨折，庭院間的呵欠和太息帶走了靑春年華。</p>
<p>友人的言語，像閃電般奪襲上腦際：「橫在我們這一代靑年面前的命運，是够悲慘的了，像我自已吧，在很小的時候，已受盡封建勢力的摧殘，種下消極的心理，早就懂得傷感和哀愁了。但現在我却向命運反抗，伴隨着大夥，爭取民族的解放。鬥爭是痛苦的，但也有歡悅。困厄的命運會增長我們不妥恊的精神，快舉起你那戰鬥的胳臂，擎起抗爭的大旗。」　　我開始試舉着那隻胳臂——感到了沉重，但最最末了終將舉起來的吧？</p>
<p>遠處傳來一聲鷄啼，天快破曉了。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>合浦鎭陷落了。陷落後的合浦鎭，第一個起來活躍的人物。便是圖董楊岳梁。他覺得現在是他恢復失去的地位，起而代陳鎭長的時候了。虧他福至心靈，把一張紅紙貼在一幅白竹布上，居然給他做成了一面旗幟，於是便率領幾個不三不四的人物，自命為「維持會」代表，打着旗幟，出來歡迎X軍。</p>
<p>他滿以為這樣一來，一個「維持會」會長的位置，穩穩可以落到他頭上來了。誰知獨眼李在旁邊看了他一眼，向翻譯附耳說了幾句話，那翻譯又向一位猴子面孔的軍官阿里阿打的說了幾句，軍官瞪眼一喝，便有幾名X軍老鷹拿小雞似的把他拿下。楊岳梁嚇得滿口只喊『無罪』。獨眼李冷冷一笑，便喝呌他在前面領路，去捉拿葉團長全家。</p>
<p>葉團長全家却早已上了船，此刻順風順水，已在十里以外了。獨眼李憤無可洩，便呌手下放起了一把火，把葉團長的家，燒成了一片白地。</p>
<p>彷彿成了慣例一樣，×軍到一處地方，總要大大的燒殺淫掠一次，現在合浦鎭旣然落進了</p>
<p>他們手裏，當然逃不了這個刧數；於是，世外桃源的合浦鎭，很快的變成了暗無天日的地獄，沒有逃出來的民衆，個個都嘗盡了人世間未有的痛苦。</p>
<p>揚岳梁被押回他自己的家裏，他的高樓大厦雖倖免於砲火，却被佔爲X軍的司令部。他這時不但不敢再存有做「維持會」會長的幻想，甚至連他的房屋都不想收回了，只希望X軍能高抬貴手，釋放了他，讓他把家裹的藏銀設法運將出來，逃到別的地方去，做一個太平無事的人。</p>
<p>誰知連這最低限度的希望都不容他滿足，獨眼李一開口，便要他報効十萬元錢，作X軍的軍餉。（三三）</p>

<h3>怕小老婆</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>嘸啥談頭，談談怕小老婆。　　「此地只官談風月，不妨睡覺吸香烟」，在這年頭，除撒肩，睡覺，吃飯，實行三大主義外，本來請君免開尊口。「多吃飯，少開口」，原是明哲保身，趨吉避凶的處世哲學，萬一不識相，仍舊要胡說亂道，也許如紅樓夢一樣，犯了意淫之戒，於是不妨來談談夫婦之道。</p>
<p>前天我在某報副刋上，被我看見了一個「怕老婆」的題目，不過因爲吃香烟要緊，沒有把該文細細拜讀，殊爲遺憾，這個題目，頗爲有趣，我認爲老婆總可以談的，並不違犯閨房法律，怕老婆更屬不妨，不過道個題目，似乎太覺陳腐，其實並不陳腐，有天地而後有萬物，有萬物而後有男女，有男女而後有夫婦，自經周公之禮一行，夫婦之制遂定，「三綱五常，禮之大典」，垂爲千古不磨之定律，故在周公之禮未廢以前，還有一談之價値。</p>
<p>家庭之內，共和制度，無法推行，而法西斯主義，乃應運而起，不是夫權專制，便是妻權橫行，怕老婆，求靜辦，原爲家庭中服從妻權的美德，三從四德主義，原不一定屬於女子，抑且適用於男子。近日女權橫行還大唱其不做男子的玩物，眞是寃枉，男子眞是女子的玩物，女子何嘗是男子的玩物呢！自有史以來，怕老婆的韻事，不知流傳過多少。古有明訓，「家有賢妻，夫不遭橫事」，假定男子而能處處服從夫人的命令，即使不是說要發財須怕老婆，包你心廣體胖，百事如意，這話我認爲極有至理。假定一個男子不怕老婆，眞是不堪造就，我最怕的男子，便是在家頥指氣使，妄作妄爲，對於老婆如同僕婦，所謂「攀戶檻兇」也者，而出外則對朋友對親戚，便不敢做聲，低頭服小，這種人我最看不起，反之，在家惟命是從，拜倒高跟鞋下，大怕其老婆，而出外則無論何人，都不買賬，所謂屈於一人之下，伸於萬人之上，這種人到是値得崇拜。</p>
<p>怕老婆我很贊同，但是怕小老婆則絕不贊同，夫妻之間，必定也曾發生過雙方戀愛，亦曾經過海誓山盟，今見大老婆年老色衰，小老婆花枝招展，便去寵辛小老婆，把大老婆置諸腦後，甚至聽了小老婆的話，去虐待髮妻，所謂「但見新人笑，那聞舊人哭」，演成寵妾虐妻，得新忘舊的悲劇，這樣的事實，在社會上數見不鮮，眞是那裏說起？故我不贊成怕小老婆，而極贊成怕大老婆。</p>
<h3>記精武體育會</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>成立已三十年會員達數萬人活動範圍很廣並設學術班等</p>
<p>我們都知道，上海有一個精武體育會，戰事沒有爆發之前，在盛大的紀念節日，游藝會中，有時會看到有精武體育會的男女會員，表演國術，造詣之深，有獨到之處。最近精武體育會又在徵求會員；因此，筆者要把該會的大概情形，寫在下面：</p>
<p>精武體育會成立於民國前二年，可是在短短三十年的歷史中，己由上海一地而展及各省，甚至南洋羣島也有分會。會員的人數，由很少的幾個，而擴大到數萬。會務的發展，不可謂不神速吧？在過去三十年中，曾舉行過十九次微求會員大會，這一次的徵求，是第三十次了。</p>
<p>精武體育會的主要目標，在使一般職業界人，納了很少的會費，得有鍛鍊體格的機會，一掃「東亞病夫」的外號，用意甚善。我們祇要看到該會的會員，凡是研究國術的，不拘男女，都有着一副强壯的體格，便不難看出三十年來，該會所造就的，對國家民族，是有怎樣的貢獻了。</p>
<p>凡是加人精武體育會做會員的，可享受該會的一切設備，如浴室，圖書室，彈子房，各種室內運動，戶外運動等。租借宿舍，也可减收租金，而加入各種研究性質的學術會，亦可减收會費的，還可參加各種團體生活，如旅行，參觀等　　「八一三」之前，精武體育會的總會所在北四川路，爲使一般會員的便利起見，在南市，閘北，中區租界之內，更設有幾處分會，這樣會員可就近習練太極拳及各種武術，國術。但「八一三」之後，北四川路成了死市，精武體育會的總會所也就在砲火中遷至大陸商塲——慈淑大樓——的上面，使會務不致中輟。</p>
<p>現在的總會所，就是以前特區分會的會所，在大陸商塲三樓。地位雖然不大，但你走得進去，可以看到有許多靑年，在那邊拍乒乓球，打彈子，有的在談天。更有一個地方，狹長的一方，地板上堆着一些厚地毯，武器，那就是每天早上會員練習國術的地方了。在大都市裹，到處是些奢侈淫蕩，而這商塲的一角，有那樣一個鍛鍊靑年們身心的團體，是沒有去過的人所不知道的吧？</p>
<p>在一般的人，也許以爲精武體育會是集中在尙武上面的一個團體，但事實却並不如此。精武體育會目前所活動的範圍很廣，包括國術班，太極拳研究團，摔角班，西洋拳班，乒乓隊，網球隊，游泳隊，圖書室，國語星期班，國語速成班，中文速記班，臨池班，話劇班，平劇班，粵劇班，漫畫班。可知這團體是文武並重，不但提倡武術，就是運動，語文，藝術等各方面，都在活動，而入會的會員得隨個性所好，加入上面的各種班次，以研究一切呢！</p>

<p>第十場</p>
<p>（四旗牌上，四鎧上，吹點絳唇，通名）俺，張憲，王貴，徐慶，牛皋。請了！元帥升帳，我等兩廂伺候。（中軍上，岳上引）赤膽忠心，保大宋錦繡乾坤。（定塲詩）膽氣堂堂貫斗牛，誓將直節報君仇。斬除元惡還車駕，不問登壇萬戶侯。俺，淸遠軍節度使，湖北路荊襄潭州制置使，武昌縣開國子，岳飛。金兀朮與劉豫合兵，已經搶了廬州。聖上親賜手札，命本帥領兵收復。來此廬州城外，紮下營寨。前回向金兵挑戰，他緊閉城門，不瞅不睬，這便如何是好？（小生與四嘍囉上，唱）風塵僕僕向前奔，不覺來到岳家營。（白）小生范希周，打聽得岳家軍在廬州城外，紮下大營，因此與衆家弟兄，不辭千里趕來。小生因恐韓將軍牧索范氏餘黨，因此改名換姓，呌做賀承信，前往投效便了！門上那位在？（中軍）何人在此喧譁？（小生）我們是投軍的。（中軍）報，轅門外有投軍的求見。（岳）喚他們進帳。（中軍）傳你們進帳，須要小心！（小生）遵命！（與嘍囉同說）參見元帥。（岳）罷了。爾來可是前來投軍？（小生）正是。（岳）有何本領？（小生）小人賀承信有飛簷走壁之能，善爬雲梯。那怕是百尺城牆，不消片刻，使能爬到，使敵人措手不及。這些位是小人心腹，也都學會小人的本領，且都勇武善戰，伏乞收納。（岳）你們來得正好。這裹有令箭一枝，命爾等今晚三更時分，爬上城去，斬關迎我大軍，不得有誤。我當派兵前來恊助。功成之後，再爲昇叙。（小生）得令！（與四嘍囉同下）（岳）王貴聽令！賀承信新來，雖是面貌誠實，或恐有許，故爾命你派遣小隊，今晚三更時分，恊助賀承　成功，借此監視，不得有誤！（王）得令！（下）（　）牛臯徐慶聽令！命爾等爲先鋒，帶領二千人馬，三更時分，殺進廬州城內。（牛，徐）得令！（下）（岳）張憲聽令！命你帶領二千人馬，　伏在壽州一帶，掩殺賊兵。（張）得令！（下）（岳）掩門。（吹打，與四旗牌中軍同下）</p>

<h3>少奶奶的扇子</h3>
<p>— 思華</p>
<p>華新出品　中聯發行　新光公映　　「少奶奶的扇子」是一個很著名的舞台劇，它像「日出」一樣，在劇本荒中，沒有加以潤飾，就搬上了銀幕。</p>
<p>雖然這是很早以前的作品，它沒有接觸到我們目前所遭遇到的最尖銳的事實；可是它所反映的一面，在如今依舊存在着。浮面的看，現社會似乎已革得很新了，其實封建渣滓，並未消滅！——男子一面在破壞女人的貞操，一面在辱罵女人的不知廉恥，這現狀還是到處可以看得到。王爾德寫這個「少奶奶的扇子」，便是用很感情的，辛辣的，譏諷的筆調，來駁斥這錯誤的觀念。</p>
<p>陸露明在劇中所扮演的人物，是否値得我們唾罵呢？她那種奢華的生活，這個社會一定不放鬆的去攻擊她的。然而，王爾德指出這是男子中心社會的自私，是加在女人身上的酷刑。陸露明爲什麽要出走，是爲了丈夫對她的不忠實，她不願意有一個不忠實的丈夫，爲了自己的幸福，才毅然出走的。那麽她爲什麽不在脫離了丈夫之後，做一個善良的女性？這不是她自己甘心墮落的；是道個社會！——一羣魔鬼包圍着她，逼她去過道樣荒唐的生活，像孫敬尤光昭所扮演的角色一樣，他們曾笑罵過她，可是又拼命的要求她玩。她也想向上，是封建觀念所產生的「名譽」，阻止了她的向上的路了。爲了「名譽」，她的丈夫沒有勇氣收留她回去，爲了「名譽」，她甚至不能去和自己的女兒親近。這不是封建社會的殘酷還是什麽呢？</p>
<p>王爾德是以最大的同情去寫陸露明這個人物的，當我們看到她不願她自己女兒步她的後塵，而忍受女兒對她所有侮辱時，我們幾乎感動得落下淚來的。</p>
<p>搬上銀幕後的「少奶奶的扇子」，並沒有跟舞台本有什麽不同；甚至於年代都沒有改動。</p>
<p>導演比「鳳求凰」進步得很多，這證明劇本的好壞是大有關係的。我覺得他處理得最好的塲面，是陸露明赴女兒之宴，入門，她很自然的去挽梅熹的手臂，接着，是大家竊竊私議的特寫，及至梅熹把陸露明介紹和袁美雲（她的女兒）見面，她頹然若失地，扇子從手中滑到地上，這幾個鏡頭，挑撥性是很强的。至於，陸露明勸袁美雲回家的一塲，雖然很感動，究竟還是劇本的好處。細小的地方，如陸露明和梅熹在花園中談話，和劉瓊跟袁美雲在花園中談話一塲，導演似乎爲了要證明花園里是有「遊人」的，所以在主角戲背後，都有臨時演員的走動；其實，在劇情中並不需要，有了反而有損空氣。</p>
<p>陸露明在這次演出中成績很不錯，不過，她的動作還是嫌生硬。袁美雲在被陸露明勸醒後幾塲戲演得很活潑。梅熹祇有在瞞袁美雲去和陸露明接近的戲較佳，其餘有幾塲欠靈活。劉瓊和傳威廉也有很好的演出。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第六回　誇人瑞一苗挺三秀　叙友情二士會羣英</p>
<p>且說朱愛人到蘇州，接了何雙玉何儷玉兩位小姐，問她們還是住在婦孺醫院裏，還是住到自由村去。兩位小姐商量了一下，便說：『我們願意住到你們醫院裏去。因爲自由村雖然淸靜，但是你不能陪着我們，而且使你心掛兩頭，反而要到自由村來照顧我們，於心不安到醫院裏住幾天，也可以參觀參觀你們服務的辛勤。但不要我們在那裏擾了你的工作嗎？』朱愛人道：『雖說住在醫院裏，但我們所住的地方，是另外一宅，不過雖醫院很近。你倘然不願意見病人的，也可以不見到病人。可是我們道個醫院，和別的醫院不同。別的旣名爲醫院，裏面當然都是病人。我們雖然名爲醫院，裏面却大半不是病人。你想產婦何嘗是病人生出來的嬰兒，何嘗是病人。雖然產婦中也有病的，嬰兒中也有病的，然而看護得好的，究居少數之列。尤其是那班嬰兒，眞是使人見了可愛，你們倘然見了那班小天使們，也要覺得可愛啦。旣然如此，現在你們且到翳院那邊去住幾天，然後再到自由村去住幾天。因爲在自由村，我們也想去設立一個小分院啦。』何儷玉道：『那就很好！不過我們怕我們來後，打擾你的工作。』朱愛人道：『决不！我的工作，也有一定時刻。上午九點鐘開始，我便巡視各病房以及產婦們的房，大槪到十一點鐘，就完畢了。下午兩點鐘，我再去巡視各育嬰室，以及小兒病房到四點多鐘，也就完畢了。其中空隙甚多，我可以來陪你們，而且吃飯我也是回冢來吃的，何至於妨害我的工作。不過在我工作的時候，你們也儘可自由游玩，不必定要我來陪你呀。』從蘇州到自由村，或是到朱愛人那個婦孺醫院，是有很好一條公路。那些公路，路面旣很寬闊，又極堅實。因爲蘇州市有個公路局，專管各處公路，倘然稍有損壞，立即修治。這裹既稱爲水鄕，自然一路上的橋樑，非常之多。有許多還是戰前所築的公路，橋樑不甚堅固，現在凡是新建築的，以及把舊路修理改建過的，一例都改爲鐵橋，以爲一勞永逸之計。（六一）</p>

<h3>觀影偶感</h3>
<p>— 迂堂</p>
<p>是總理忌辰，天晴朗得可愛，車子打一家新開的電影院過，屋頂上扯着巨幅半旗，被風括得　　地響，門口已掛着老大的客滿牌子，人還是潮水般的往裏面擁，顯露着矛盾，往往使人發生啼笑皆非之感。苦悶的人呀——，別躊躇，快進去找個舒適的座位吧。偶爾看次把電影，畢竟算不了是罪大惡極的，這樣的解嘲着，自己也踱進了南京。</p>
<p>片子是里昂巴萊穆跟劉亞理司主演的「妙手療心」，是一個年輕醫生，怎樣在醫藥之外，用心藥醫治一個女郎的心病的故事。這裏我不願詳叙本事，浪費篇幅，雖然我對於幾位主角的演技，表示滿意，可是因爲我並非專家，所以也寫不出什麽影評。一方面因爲這張片子，正是叙述和我職業相同的一件故事，在看了之後，發生了兩個感想。</p>
<p>第一，歐美影片在叙述到某特種職業的人物，塲所，道具時，必力求其像眞，如醫院車站郵局警署等塲所，和有關的一切人物，道具，雖是極微細的地方，也一點不肯忽略。這一點在國產影片裏，應該自認差得很遠，別的不談，就拿影片中時常可以看見的醫院來說，過去有好幾張國產片中的醫院塲面，不特因陋就簡，不能做到像眞，就連裏面的醫師護士等的服裝動作，以及醫藥上應用道具，也是錯誤百出。在一般親衆，也許祇要看見穿白外套的，便認做醫師，戴白帽子的便認做護士，亂放着幾個燒瓶，幾只試管的，便認做實騐室，但是在內行眼中，就難免會發現許多無可原宥的不合理的地方。爲了提高國產片的水準，我希望導演在遇到有描述特種職業的塲所人物道具的時候，應該不恥下問，聘請一位該種職業的專家，以備諮詢，因爲一部片子問世，不特要供千萬人的觀摩，而且要有開拓國外市塲的準備，理應一點不鬧笑話才好。</p>
<p>第二，本片所啟示於觀衆的，是一個醫師臨診，應以診斷爲首要，治療次之，一種疾病在沒有確定的診斷之先，切不可妄加揣測，亂投藥石，討好病家，因爲病家大都不求診斷確切，但求趕緊治療。像本片中的實習醫師，因肯着意於此點，而獲得一位著名診斷學家的靑睞，雖然因此開罪院長，失歡病家，但那位專家却願意把畢生的本領，單單傳授給他，並且說一千個醫師當中，也雖得造就一個診斷學家，醫界中人看過本片的不在少數，聽了此話，應當有不少內愧的。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一二〇）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>連環套是武戲中的羣戲</p>
<p>姓黃的栽了筋頭不算，御馬也就永遠要不回來，期限一到天霸的全家都要斬首，就是照好的方面來講，饒倖天霸戰勝了竇爾墩，倘他敗回山去把御馬殺死，從此遠颺，不履行晋京打官司的諾言；那麽天霸全家也是活不成的。光祖思來想去才籌劃出個揷刀盜鈎的妙計來，呌竇爾墩自動的懷德而畏威，揣不出天霸的本領究是如何高强，因此才能和平解决，搭救了天霸全家的性命。可見他的思慮周密，尤在他見義勇爲的性格之上，天霜得了這樣一位好助手，眞正是幸運之極，同時讓現在的人看了，也稍微把義氣二字看重了一些。</p>
<p>楊小樓壯年時代演這齣戲時，我曾看過李德仲同他配竇爾墩，王長林配朱光祖，李王兩人都是文武兼全的角色，唱唸白眞是老辣爽脆之極。「盜馬」與「盜鈎」時，都有幾個極好看的身段，小樓晚年則以金少山郝壽臣兩人配竇爾墩，王長林傳小山配朱光祖，金郝嗓音雖亮，但一則太飄，一則太火，並且他兩人的武工都沒有根底，當然比不上李老供奉的脚下有根。趟馬時邊式登樣，傳小山雖是票友下海，但他自從拜入長林門下後，的確很下過苦工，得到王氏的眞傳。長林故後，武丑行當以他爲第一，可惜四年前患咯血症死了，年紀僅有五十幾歲。現在能演「連環套」的，半凈兩行雖尙有人，然而開口跳這行人材實在太缺乏了。王福山是王長林的兒子，可惜他的能耐太也中常，反倒不如北方的葉盛章，南方的盧慶元。馬富祿前幾年曾發狠練武，將來也可帶演幾齣武丑戲，不想他沒有恒心，無戲時太喜义麻將，這也是因他太紅太懶，收人太豐，所以就不求上進了。我很希望他能好好的幹，不要恃紅而驕，他日文武丑全材之選，恐捨他莫屬了。</p>

<h3>金融　金價穩中帶疲</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚暗盤、情勢突轉呆悶、毫無精彩、午前始終徘徊於二千〇九十五元及九十八元之間、良以大戶觀望之故、中途雖證券幫進多於出、惟人心因外滙帶硬趨疲、故現金號與某錢兌業相繼出售、致市價終則轉疲、然午後即證券幫忽想復吐、奈買方奇缺、故價雖喊低至二千〇九十元邊境、但仍難獲對手、結果明則軋跌二元、實則回降八元、一天交易不多、上午約五百兩光景、下午一無做開、銀樓飾金亦未變動、海關金暨中英純金等一致微降、</p>
<h3>烚赤僅小二元</h3>
<p>自晨每條十兩、初無做開、迨至九時三刻、始見證券幫賣予錢兌業三十兩、二千〇九十七元爲開盤價、較之前收做低一元、開後證券幫忽止售力吸、進錢兌業五十兩、價亦九十七元、又進銀樓幫及現金號、各五十兩、九十八元、繼之某銀號相同價亦進現金號五十兩、未幾外滙潛勢報硬、故某銀號即復吐予錢樓幫五十兩、價九十七元、錢兌業說賣予證券幫五十兩九十五元、後證券幫忽復售予銀樓幫五十兩、九十七元、俄頃又復進錢兌業五十兩、價九十五元、後錢兌業互做五十兩、九十六元、時已十一點半許、此後供求轉稀、價亦呆定、延至午時未見做開、故午收仍爲九十六元、午後雖外滙頗呆定、惟證券幫忽想復吐、價直喊低至九十元賣出、然仍難獲對手、致未做開、然某錢兌業門市亦稀少進出、僅有九十一元賣予本地客幫數十兩、若照午收價二千〇九十六元、結果較上日則軋跌二元、現金號之本牌金售出價二千一百元、收進二千〇八十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<h3>飾金兌價不動</h3>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出均無更動、大同行仍懸二百十三元、新同行亦仍爲二百十一元、收進二百〇五元、</p>
<h3>純金縮半便士</h3>
<p>十三日倫敦電、英純金每盎司縮半便士、計退達七鎊八先令二便士半、致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦降低至一千二百〇九元九角、掛牌海關金則未更動、仍爲二元三角九分二厘、上海標準標金價亦隨降四角、計一千二百〇五元二角、</p>
<h3>英金鎊　需要仍旺</h3>
<p>昨英純金跌半辦士、英美匯兌未動、本埠昨外滙初尚穩定、後需要轉稀、港電拋塞頗殷、並有沙遜及紗花幫獲利轉賣、銀行吸胃未暢、市價趨鬆、午後交易更稀、市況呆滯、烚赤開盤堅挺、無如外匯鬆動、金號錢兌業等、裹足不前、浮多獲利了結、市況趨軟、午後散戶繼續出籠、進者甚稀、難獲對手、交易寥寥、勢甚虛弱、外幣英金鎊、需要甚旺、殷富搜購四百餘枚、英美金票吸納未健、交易稀少、各幣少數微降、公會成交絕稀、僅承泰售出惠通進美金票五百元、昨日市價、英金票升五分、美金鎊降一角、美金票降五釐、法郎標降五毫、其他各幣、俱無更動</p>
<h3>貼現站住</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、始高終回、每千元一度承上日餘風、昂達五十一元、不久即見回下、午刻五十元零二角半、下午五十元、與上日未分榮辱云、</p>
<h3>沙遜與紗花幫轉賣　外匯重又轉鬆</h3>
<p>滙市昨「華北聯銀」暨平津投機商及各大洋行等雖扒、但因外商銀行、頗肯供給、且西商沙遜與華行及紗花幫等、咸起吐售、致潛勢稍鬆、唯中途鮮少變化、交易轉清、至港滙因雙方供求勢均、未分榮辱、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠未更、紐約銀價亦仍呆定、倫敦生金縮半便士、滙兌英對美大九毫、對法升三生丁、對滬降〇六二五、美對英仍平、對法長〇六二五、對滬跌八分、中央掛牌、各滙如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英滙八便士二六五六二五、美滙十六元一五六二五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後洋行首來扒結滙豐·麥加利·華比英滙八便士二五、兼美滙十六元一二五、爲狀略軟、滙豐掛牌及白銀平衡稅揭曉、均無升降、此後雖「華北聯銀」及平津投機商等暗中力扒、但以西商沙遜暨華行及紗花幫等猛塞不已、故瀉勢轉鬆、沙遜紗花幫華行賣予外行有利英滙八便士二六五六二五、及美滙十六元一八七五、繼之沙遜又售予外行有利英滙八便士二九六八七五、其時美滙亦硬至十六元二一八七五、近午華行賣予洋行港滙五十五元半、於是趨勢漸平、午收銀行賣價英滙八便士二八一二五、美滙十六元一八七五、</p>
<p>後市狀況沉寂、僅有洋行稍來扒結滙豐英滙八便士二八一二五、後又結進華比某行美匯十六元一八七五、是以爲狀頗形呆定、延至晚收、銀行賣價英滙八便士二八一二五、美滙十六元一八七五、結果校上日、英鬆〇一五六二五、美長〇三一二五、港滙則未分軒輊、</p>
<h3>印銀疲弱英銀平</h3>
<p>十三日倫敦電、銀市沉寂而呆、收盤後但有少數照掛牌買進、大條銀近遠期均未更動、又紐約銀、美銀價依然呆定、又孟買電、印銀現平期疲、現貨未更、近遠期均縮三安那、</p>
<h3>糧食　粳秈囤戶　均有回出</h3>
<p>行市立小二三角</p>
<p>杜米昨來源、河下共到十四號、車運包子六七千包、大局自轉向懈勢以來、昨復旺到、人心愈餒、囤戶大都推出、致市面下游、但本街乘廉價拉進者、亦不乏人、惟吃盤殊苛、結果南北兩粳及薄稻價悉落二三角、河下貨跌風尤烈、續瀉四五角、杜羊尖賴貨稀略貶角外、埠尖則受客尖影響、亦降二三角、變元囤戶亦有回出、致削三角有奇、</p>
<p>客秈市面、趨入正軌、高次各擋別價、涇渭分清、緣客囤以再擯恐遭不利、紛紛求脫、而本客實銷兩淡、市乃立小二三角、價小後本客需化尚活、故成交數又有二千多包、頂貨南京秈僅開十三元一角、大市京秈與高蕪秈統開十三元、中次蕪秈已降低至十二元一二角</p>
<p>昨有米三千三百包由香港來轉天津、</p>
<h3>麵粉內地銷路突起</h3>
<p>麵粉客幫交易、並無特殊開展、惟零星去化、尚稱活動、蓋北洋幫受洋粉牽制、迄無大量進胃、南洋幫亦嫌價昂、交易不旺、惟日昨內地常錫等處、突來申市採辦麵粉、因當地人口漸增、需要較繁、人心亦被帶起不少、統市由南北兩幫及內地幫各辦二三萬包、本街零批約有七千餘包、二號粉廠盤四元七角、三四號粉與雜牌粉略有參差、市面漸趨穩固、出口粉昨有八千包運烟臺、七千包運天津、三千包香港來轉天津、五千包轉烟臺今日尚有粉二萬二千包、麩皮二千袋、均運汕頭</p>
<p>麥市來源、除廠定洋麥新到一船外、本麥到貨仍感缺乏、因各產區均被某方統制、整票來源、幾告絕望、各廠銷路、亦已無形停頓、昨聞送廠貨約有一二百包、價六元八角至七元、以麥品高次關係、售價稍有參差、至正式市塲交易、仍無隻包成交云、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗生產似嫌過剩　多方竭力拉提：終覺難以爲繼</h3>
<p>紗市始漲繼疲、趨勢仍不離徘徊之境、蓋以實需不暢、廠方產量、因新創之小型模廠業已開工、較前大爲增加、故就市塲情形論之、每日有感供過於求之勢、多方雖竭力維持拉提、然卒難站定、但一般殷富者吸收之念未絕、一跌則來拉進、一升吐出者亦不乏人、所以盤旋之力、異常牽絲也、午後買方復見活動、市象又轉好面、此種狀態、可說每日如斯、上午疲、後市則回定、而上升一二元光景、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、承上日午後氣勢轉挺、市塲呌價一律喊高、開價加五角、二十支天女價爲三百九十五元、惟雙馬開盤與上日相仿、少頃某方又來賣出、同時客幫生意不旺、市價忽趨下降、步步而小、二十支雙馬價爲三百九十一元、棧單做到三百八十八元、比開盤價要跌三元半、繼以趁低又來買進、稍形回昂、迨至收盤價雙馬爲三百九十二元、棧單價爲三百八十九元、午後內地幫稍有需要、然買振華廠之紗、多方又來活動、市態稍昂、須待明晨如何、再視實需爲進退也、查全日各幫買去統計二千零六十包、行情二十支雙馬價比上日價跌一元、其他紗市亦帶疲、振華廠開出十六支雙龍一百六十包、價爲三百十五元、又十二支雙龍一百五十包、價爲三百十二元順手、昨日出口棉紗六十件運烟台、二百九十件運天津、今日尚有二百五十件運汕頭、六十件運香港、茲將各幫口成交之額量錄左、</p>
<p>同行　一、三〇五　汕頭　一〇</p>
<p>內地　三七〇　廈門　一五</p>
<p>四川　六〇　香港　六〇</p>
<p>溫州　一四〇　天津　五〇</p>
<p>江西　二〇　寗波　一〇</p>
<p>雲南　二〇　統計　二、〇六〇</p>
<p>日紗市塲開盤、曾見一度緊張局面、一跳四五元、多說北路津幫有生意、人心堅挺、繼以多頭出籠、又復回挫、結果仍漲二·三元有奇、二十支水月現紗價爲三百三十六元、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百二十九元之譜、</p>
<h3>火機花出七十元關</h3>
<p>本棉生意依然沉悶如故、廠方絕無舉動、實因貨物缺乏、呌價殊昂、且步步上升、新高峯層見迭出、火機花又穿出七十元關外、爲七十元〇七角半、通州花仍與上日高價相同、蘇北未有來源、姚花到三千六百包、茲將做開現棉交易錄左、</p>

<p>火機七〇·七五又　二〇〇包　現鈔</p>
<p>常陰七九·二五又　五〇〇包　滙劃</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約晨初開盤即漲一至三磅音、中途曾因華盛頓方面對於農業立法尚無新發展而轉疲、後因海外棉商進購及空頭抵補、最高價收盤、結果上漲二至八磅音、印度棉市頗堅定、昨日連同預測又漲一羅比、昨印棉因有一經紀人逝世、市塲停止交易一天、唯據前日黃昏接得瑪哈強來電、四五月份白洛區爲一五七羅比、埃及跌十磅音、昨日滙兌轉緊、折合法幣、棉價俱漲、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲九角、印棉漲四角、埃及棉漲八角餘、</p>
<p>滬市外棉交易、異常靜寂、中外各廠均無交易聞、良以紗價不振、及目前印棉之運輸困難而暫抱觀望也、茲將昨日棉價分列於後、</p>

<h3>雜糧　黃豆一致回軟</h3>
<p>昨日期現黃豆均呈軟勢、杜豆沙黃因時令關係、到銷均淡、大宗賣買、在平時向依車豆爲主、但在此環境下、不免接近連豆、然近日銷塲清懈、市勢軟化、故連豆赤受牽制、計開大連豆四月份交七車、價爲八元三角、比前市跌二分、現豆由本街廣幫採去崇明沙黃五百包、價爲八元五角至八元三角半、平湖中粒杜豆七十包、價爲九元六角半、及大連現豆一車、價爲八元四角、昨有豆子十一噸運新加坡、</p>

<p>粗布平定</p>
<p>國布白貨細布·細斜、永安申新新裕各廠出品、浙贛幫需要續佳、市上廉額手貨、漸次售罄、廠盤申新富貴細布十三元、細斜十二元、堅持不鬆、故手貨價格亦愈賣愈緊、昨市細布十二元七角半至十二元九角、細斜十一元八角半至九角、由銀行幫及甬紹甌幫購進二百餘件、永安大鵬細布以現貨斷檔、殊少成交、副牌紅大鵬售開十三元、較前漲二角、富貴細布·細斜後市結果每疋漲一角之譜、惟天津恒源廠及各單純織廠出品、售盤均無榮辱、粗布交易清淡、價亦平平、漂染布疋售價殊少更動、浙贛幫需胃較繁、成交漂布漂料府綢洋紗色布等貨三百餘件、</p>

<h3>一年來　上海工商業的異動</h3>
<p>— 慧　（續）</p>
<p>（五）推受盤</p>
<p>工商業的推受盤，大抵多是無法維持或無意經營，同時，却巧有後來者有意於此，願意繼續，結果是發生了這推受盤的事實。其所異於清理結束，就是後繼有人，所以，受盤也是爲工商業重要異動。在一年來，這種推受盤的工商廠號計有八百七十三家；內工廠衹一百三十一家，商號七百四十二家，就推受盤八百七十三家的工商廠號。按照工商業的分類來分析，要以飲食業二百九十八家爲最多了。這因爲成爲孤島後，消耗事業的畸形發展，有以致之呢！次之爲衣着業一百十七家，日用品業一百十六家，這也是成爲孤島後各地的避難人民認爲世外桃源，因爲是這樣的緣故，所以人口是不斷地的湧來，結果較戰前，是膨脹了。當然，衣着用品的銷路，是需要殷切，於是該兩業隨之而繁榮起來，無疑，變異也跟着而眾多了。復次爲燃料業和衛生業各四十七家，金屬電氣四十三家，行旅業二十七家，醫藥業二十五家，文化業二十二家，娛樂業十八家，交通運輸業十五家，裝飾業十三家，土木業十家，金融和公用業各五家，特种事業二家，而不詳業別的則有六十三家。</p>
<p>再把推受盤八百七十三家的工商廠號在各月份家數來比較，那末，要以三月份的九十二家爲第一位了，九月份八十六家第二位，十月份八十家第三位，四月份和五月份均各七十八家第四位，　月份七十七家第五位，十二月份七十五家第六位，十一月份七十四家第七位，七月份六十七家第八位，六月份五十九家第九位，八月份五十六家第十位，而以一月份五十一家殿末位。這裏可見其各月份異動家數是隨商業季節呢，茲將各月份業別的家數，列表於下；</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On the Reporting of Guerrilla Warfare Zones</h3>
<p>People like to call Shanghai an isolated island, because its land transportation is frequently cut off, and only ships can navigate the seas, which is indeed similar to an isolated island. Furthermore, with the obstruction of human affairs around it, the situation appears even more isolated. The news industry relies on a wide population and smooth transportation as its basic conditions. Shanghai is particularly isolated, and the news industry is facing great difficulties. The difficulty lies in the industry itself, which is seeking its own way out, but this is not enough to be used as material for newspaper discussion. However, there is one thing that is a product of the current special state, and I would like to ask those who care about newspapers to cooperate.</p>
<p>What is this matter? The descriptions that readers pay the most attention to are war reports. War reports come from the war zone, which is divided into two categories: one is the extended front war zone, and the other is the vast guerrilla war zone. The front war zone is a line or a point, while the guerrilla war zone is a plane or even a three-dimensional space. Speaking of the line, it stretches from northern Shanxi in the north to Hainan in the south. Among them, eastern Hebei, southern Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and western Zhejiang are all points, which are very extensive. Speaking of the guerrilla war zone, the area between Jiangsu and Zhejiang is centered on Taihu Lake, Pudong is centered on Nanhui, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are centered on Tongchonghai, and northern Anhui is centered on Hongze Lake. Furthermore, from eastern Shandong, southern Hebei, and northern Henan to Suiyuan, Rehe, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, it is extremely vast. The war reports from the front war zone are transmitted from the front line to the rear, converging in Chongqing, and broadcast at home and abroad, which is fast, detailed, and accurate. The isolated island is the same as Washington, London, and Hong Kong, and also the same as Chongqing. It has never lagged behind due to the special state. However, there are great difficulties in the war reports about the guerrilla war zone.</p>
<p>Reporters cannot go deep into the guerrilla war zone to conduct interviews in person, and there are many reasons for this. Or they have gone deep, or the original news network has not been completely destroyed, but the information obtained from the interviews still cannot be regularly supplied to the newspapers. Therefore, newspapers must find another way to collect war reports from the guerrilla war zone. For more than a year, the newspapers have published a lot of guerrilla reports, which were not easy to obtain. However, because the interviews and supply cannot be fully in line with the normal track, problems inevitably arise in terms of speed, detail, and preparation from time to time. Especially because the society's expectations are high, it often spurs and blames them. Several points are listed as examples: First, guerrilla warfare in various regions has many arduous and outstanding innovations. People with lofty ideals have fallen one after another, succeeding or sacrificing themselves. Their people and their deeds are enough to be announced to the world and future generations. How should we promote them as much as possible to praise the martyrs and inspire future generations? However, they are ignored by the newspapers, and their loyal bones rot with the grass and trees, and their names are buried and not revealed. If they dedicate themselves to the country and nation, and are nameless heroes, they will sacrifice themselves for the country and be at peace with themselves. They only hope that the War of Resistance will be won and the country will be built, and they can smile in the afterlife. Why should they compete for fame for a hundred generations? However, are the vigorous and heroic deeds not the ideal objects for newspapers to draw material from? Why are they not recorded? Second, some traitors have internal conflicts, and their plans are exposed. They are noisy and disturbing, and even the chickens and dogs are uneasy. Or rogues steal and commit crimes, or private feuds are sought after, and they engage in fighting and weapons. The villages are full of false alarms. Or gunshots are heard in the middle of the night, and it is not known where they come from. Or robbery happens on the road, and it is not known where they go. The pursuit of the truth is just the arrogance and abuse of power. However, the newspapers are ignorant of the truth, and they promote their words and say that the guerrillas attacked, fought fiercely, annihilated the enemy, punished the traitors, and returned with great success and retreat with the whole division. Those who do not know the truth only see that the situation remains the same, and they will lament the futility of their efforts. Those who know the reality take one example as a hundred, and think that such guerrilla warfare can not be short-lived? The isolated island is close to the Taihu Lake guerrilla area, and also separated from Nanhui and Tongchonghai by the river. It is more convenient to see and hear, and there are more records. However, according to those who come from these places, the inaccuracies in the guerrilla reports recorded in various newspapers are also 20-30%.</p>
<p>All these accusations are gradually becoming ashamed of by the reporters, and they are also the responsibilities that the newspapers will never shirk. How should we make the vigorous and heroic deeds recorded and published in the future? How should we make all kinds of false rumors disappear from the newspapers? This is what the reporters should strive for. However, with the blockade of Shanghai's return, and the fact that the news agency is inferior to peacetime, we have to expect those who are enlightened. In this second phase of the War of Resistance, guerrilla tactics are becoming more and more important, and the number of guerrilla units has greatly increased. The recent Chongqing telecommunications have also proved that its organization and command have sound and unified methods. Therefore, it is not only the attention and needs of newspaper readers to make rapid, detailed, and accurate propaganda for the reality of the guerrilla area, but also to cherish the guerrilla units and promote the necessary functions of guerrilla warfare. Since the propaganda promotes its functions, it is necessary to commend its merits. Since the propaganda cherishes its troops, it is necessary to distinguish the true from the false, and to expose the rogues who take advantage of the name of guerrilla warfare to commit evils, in order to correct the vision of the general public. This kind of effort is the newspaper's unshirkable responsibility, but we firmly believe that if people from all walks of life give reporters more help, the effect will be even greater. For example, people in the Taihu Lake area will never allow the merits of the Taihu Lake guerrillas to be buried and not revealed, and will not sit idly by and watch the situation of the Taihu Lake guerrillas being misrepresented, and will not allow the traitors, bandits, and local bullies in the Taihu Lake area to defile the reputation of the guerrillas. Extrapolating to other places, it is the same everywhere. This is not only a question of the truth of the newspaper news, but also a way to promote the functions of guerrilla warfare, which is also a way to accelerate the achievement of the second phase of the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Sends Telegram Congratulating the Opening of the Third Council of the Academia Sinica. When Enemy Countries Become a Problem, Scholars Should Redouble Their Efforts to Wipe Out Humiliation and Strengthen Themselves. Academic Research Should Grasp the Needs of the Times.</h3>
<p>(Kunming) Generalissimo Chiang sent a telegram of congratulations to the Third Council of the Academia Sinica, which read: "To President Cai of the Academia Sinica in Kunming and all gentlemen, the Third Council of the Academia Sinica is meeting in Kunming, bringing together leaders from the academic circles of the country to review the achievements of past specialized research, determine the direction of future academic advancement, and gather ideas and insights to benefit the country. Zhongzheng believes that a country on this earth cannot be established without learning. Now that the country is in the midst of foreign troubles from enemy countries, scholars should redouble their efforts to wipe out humiliation and strengthen themselves. Resistance and national construction rely on the succession of experts and the tireless efforts of the academic community. Their contributions are no less than the blood sacrifices of soldiers on the battlefield. Speaking of the extreme of invention and creation, it is often the source of military victory, and it often starts from the slightest and achieves far-reaching results. The invention of one thing and one principle is enough to reverse the entire war situation and change the future of human life. The past achievements in academic history are clear, and why would the descendants of the Yellow Emperor be willing to lag behind others? The so-called academics cannot be limited to one style. Pure science and applied science are like the roots and branches, each with its own wonderful use. Humanities and natural sciences are also like the hands, feet, ears, and eyes, which cannot be neglected. It is ignorant to distinguish their importance. Now that the country is in this extraordinary situation, to overcome the enemy and win victory, we must give priority to benefiting the war. To imitate and build, we must give priority to revival and construction. It is not a time for academic leisure and entertainment, but a time for people with aspirations to generously serve the country. The order of urgency should be established and used as a model. Only by making a real contribution to the current national economy can we establish the position of our country's academics in the world. Zhongzheng also believes that in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, all academics that can stand out and be remembered forever are due to grasping the needs of the times, which can satisfy the minds of the majority of people. Now the world is turbulent, and the tide is urgent. It is up to no one else to help the falling and rescue the drowning. I hope that you gentlemen will examine the needs of the country and the people, explore the origins of world education and human heart, and formulate strategies to promote the glory of our culture and promote the great cause of our revolution. I offer my thoughts, and my words do not fully express my meaning. I wish your conference success. Chiang Kai-shek." (Fourteenth day dispatch)</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Cares for Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Since the War of Resistance, Chinese heroic soldiers have used their flesh and blood to resist the violent enemy. Generalissimo Chiang is very concerned about those who are wounded and seek medical treatment.

The soldiers, moved by this, even asked to return to the front line before their injuries were healed. The so-called revolutionary soldiers are truly worthy of the name. Generalissimo Chiang also sent senior staff members Chen Fangzhi and others from the Attendant's Office to Guangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, and Jin Songpan and others to Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Sichuan to inspect hospitals in various places and offer condolences on behalf of Generalissimo Chiang.

<p>(Chongqing) According to a foreign military observer, since the news of US aid to China with huge sums of money came out, it has caused an uproar in Japan from top to bottom. All kinds of absurd behaviors are due to the Tokyo authorities' unclear understanding of the situation. At this time, the great powers' aid to China is a proper move. If they continue to stand idly by, their own interests will be stripped away. In other words, it is simply giving it to Japan. Since the start of the war of aggression against China, Japan has been threatening the interests of the great powers in China step by step, such as the issue of opening the Yangtze River, which has been delayed for various reasons. Therefore, the remarks of the Tokyo side are just bluster. In fact, Japan has no ability to stop the great powers from aiding China, and the countries aiding China will never stop aiding because of Japan's opposition. The observer finally said that according to the current situation, Japan knows that the war of aggression against China will end indefinitely, so it is enraged and recklessly acts in China, while the great powers will always be the backing of China, which is beyond doubt. However, when Japan is financially exhausted, it will join its two European allies at all costs and will not hesitate to provoke World War II. (Fourteenth day Express News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Promotes Counterfeit Currency in North China; Britain and the United States File Protests; China and Britain Sign an Agreement on the Cooperative Purchase of Transport Vehicles; Britain Will Issue a Statement on Stabilizing the Legal Tender</h3>
<p>(Washington) The State Department revealed last night that U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, has once again protested Japan's forced use of Japanese currency and counterfeit money in North China. This protest by the United States is taking the same action as Britain. It is said that the content of the note is roughly the same as the one sent to Japan by the United States on October 6. According to information revealed by U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles, the United States has repeatedly protested because Japan's plan in North China endangers U.S. interests and violates U.S. treaty rights. Furthermore, American merchants in North China have been affected by Japan's currency system and export regulations, causing American commerce there to suffer a "fatal blow." Therefore, they petitioned the State Department last week for protection, and the State Department, based on this, once again protested to Japan. (Associated Press dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Under Secretary of State Welles stated today that the United States has protested to Japan against the new currency plan implemented in North China, and especially opposes the forced circulation of Japanese currency to exclude Chinese legal tender. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th) (London) British Under Secretary of State Butler announced in the House of Commons today that Britain will negotiate with Japan, stating that the currency regulations recently promulgated by Japan in North China greatly hinder the legitimate commercial interests of the British. The so-called Chinese Provisional Government has announced that from March 11, twelve special commodities will not be allowed to be exported unless foreign exchange is sold at a price of 14 pence using "Federal Reserve" banknotes. These twelve commodities account for the main part of North China's export trade. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Chinese government and Sandgrouse Aircraft Ltd. signed a contract at the Chinese Embassy this afternoon. China has ordered 200 three-and-a-half-ton trucks and 100 seven-ton trucks. The latter are all equipped with eight-ton trailers. The total value will be £2,230,011, including parts and repair equipment worth approximately £30,884. Payment of the loan is guaranteed by the British Export Credit Guarantee Department. All of these trucks will be delivered in Rangoon. The first batch of light trucks will be delivered within four weeks, and the first batch of heavy trucks will be delivered within eight weeks. (Reuters on the 14th) (London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon announced in the House of Commons today that he will submit a bill tomorrow to complete the Sino-British financial agreement and assist China's stabilization fund. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, opposition Labour Party member Bellenger asked Foreign Secretary Simon whether the operation of the Chinese legal tender balance fund was the same as that of the British exchange balance fund, and whether the British government had consulted other countries regarding the Chinese legal tender balance fund, as if Britain, France, and the United States had consulted each other in accordance with the monetary agreement. Foreign Secretary Simon immediately replied, "I intend to submit the necessary legal bill tomorrow, at which time it can be submitted for discussion." Bellenger then asked, "I will wait for this bill, but I don't know if the Chancellor can agree to answer my questions when he submits this bill." The Chancellor replied again, "It may be necessary to issue a statement regarding the operation of the Chinese legal tender balance fund." (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Concessions Threatened; Britain to Protest to Japan Again</h3>
<p>(London) London has received intelligence that there is a pro-Japanese terrorist committee outside the British and French concessions in Tianjin, whose purpose is to carry out terrorist acts in the concessions and then escape outside the boundaries. It is expected that the British government will continue to protest to Japan regarding the installation of an electric fence in Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses the Resumption of Navigation on the Yangtze River; The British Government Contacts the Naval Commander and Attaches Importance to the Current Situation in the Tianjin Concessions</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met this afternoon, Conservative Party member Moreing asked whether the government had devised a safe and rapid way for more than 100 British expatriates in Hankou, China, to travel to Shanghai, and for a large number of expatriates in Shanghai to travel to Hankou for business reasons. Under Secretary of State Butler of the Foreign Office immediately replied, "The Foreign Office is actively considering this situation." Moreing also asked, "Is the Foreign Office aware that the Japanese army does not allow British ships to sail on the Yangtze River and does not allow British expatriates to board Japanese ships? Regarding the restoration of navigation on the Yangtze River to protect the legitimate business of Britain and other countries, does the Foreign Office intend to contact the commander of the British fleet in China to take appropriate measures?" Under Secretary of State Butler replied again, "This matter is of great importance, and the Foreign Office has indeed consulted with the commander of the fleet in China." (Havas dispatch on the 13th) (London) Under Secretary of State Butler made a statement on the situation in Tianjin in the House of Commons today, stating that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie sent a note to the Japanese Foreign Minister on March 4, explaining the legitimate attitude adopted by the British authorities in Tianjin and requesting the Japanese government to pay attention to the various actions taken against the British concession in Tianjin, and to issue instructions as soon as possible to urge the local Japanese authorities to adopt a more moderate attitude. Labour Party member Noel-Baker asked if it was true that the British concession in Tianjin had gradually become a Japanese detention center. Butler replied that it was not true, but the seriousness of the situation was not lessened by this answer. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th) (London) Under Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Britain has submitted 22 protests to the Japanese government regarding cases of damage to British people or their property, of which the Japanese side has apologized for nine cases, compensated for four cases, and agreed to compensate for three cases. A member asked whether the British government had received a reply after sending a note to the Japanese government on the issue of the open door policy in China. Butler replied that the British government, in view of the Japanese government's formal declaration, issued a note stating the British government's attitude towards the situation in the Far East, and has not yet received a reply. The question of when to reply is of course a matter for the Japanese government to decide. Butler later mentioned the bombing of the Robertson Hospital in Xi'an, saying that the hospital was directly hit by Japanese aircraft three times, destroying the dissecting room, the X-ray department, the machine room, and two hospital buildings. All of these buildings had two British flags as identification. One Chinese nurse died, but no foreigners were injured. The British government immediately protested to the Japanese government and reserved the right to demand compensation. A member also asked whether the Japanese side had requested 32 positions in the Guangzhou Customs. Butler replied that Foreign Secretary Halifax was aware of this request, but had not yet indicated acceptance. However, in any case, the British government has made it clear that the current changes in the personnel of the Chinese Customs are only temporary measures, and must be reconsidered when the war ends. Butler also said that the new bridge over the Hai River between the Italian and Japanese concessions in Tianjin has been completed and opened to traffic on March 10. However, this bridge is upstream of the British and French concessions, so it seems that there is no need to find a way to deal with it. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary's Speech: Expanding Military Preparations Without Forgetting Peace; Funding for Social Undertakings Still Exceeds Military Spending, and Journalists are Advised to Record Things Carefully</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Halifax gave a speech in Sunderland last night, stating that the figures for Britain's rearmament are so large and have been so widely publicized in newspapers that the huge sums of money that the country spends on social undertakings each year are sometimes overshadowed by them, so they are not noticed by the general public. In the total amount of this year's budget, national defense accounts for 26.8%, while social undertakings account for 29.6%. Even at this time of unprecedentedly large military expenditure, the expenditure on social undertakings still exceeds many other items. Even in the estimated figures for next year's budget, the expenditure allocated for social undertakings exceeds the total amount of public debt (excluding the various public debts used for the military buildup program) by £28,000,000. Therefore, it cannot be said that the government is exploiting the health and daily lives of the British people and wasting taxpayers' money on cannons, warships, and airplanes. If we ignore the expenditure on strengthening military preparations, we will suffer the consequences ourselves. Since we are enthusiastic about improving the living conditions of the people, we must guarantee their safety and give the country sufficient strength to protect their rights and interests and maintain their independence. At present, in addition to the events that are currently happening, the air is often filled with alarming rumors of impending disasters. He feared that the people of the country would not carefully distinguish between facts and rumors. There are some people who, for whatever reason, like to spread rumors or spread distortions. This is why the responsibility of the press is so great. Britain has complete freedom of speech, and this responsibility is even greater. He wanted to appeal to editors, reporters, and readers of newspapers to give close consideration to all news concerning the ambitions of foreign governments. Distorting or sensationalizing foreign news not only endangers oneself, but can also lead to the failure of the goals of various political parties. As far as the government is concerned, its actions are not influenced by irresponsible speculation, but it will continue to take any necessary steps while continuing to pursue peace to ensure that the country has the strength and self-confidence required by its position and environment. The government will devote itself to this, because it is confident that it can make as great a contribution as any other country to the creation of a better world. While faithfully fulfilling its primary responsibility to the people of the country, the government will also not neglect the opportunity to sincerely engage with other governments to eliminate misunderstandings and suspicions and strengthen the forces of peace. Halifax then recounted the international situation, saying that in his opinion, if Britain had not maintained its consistent policy on major international disputes in the past few years, there would have been a serious risk of triggering a European war each time. Some have said that the British government's actions on Minorca were an intervention in the Spanish Civil War, but this is not the case. Actions to facilitate discussions between the two sides did not detract from Britain's neutrality. Britain did this to save lives. At that time, the Nationalist forces had decided to attack Minorca, and the island's defenders did not have the opportunity to effectively resist or obtain assistance. As a result, the people were subjected to more suffering. The British warship did not intervene or mediate, but was ordered to transport Spanish negotiators. Useless sacrifices were thus avoided. The British government has made a contribution to peace and humanity, which both sides admired. As for Britain's recognition of the Nationalist government, it was not an endorsement of its political system, but because it was obeyed by the majority of the people in that country, it was an authority that other governments had to have official relations with.

<h3>The Situation in Spain is Chaotic; Madrid Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>(London) Under Secretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the situation in central Spain remains extremely chaotic, and the British government has not contacted either the Republican or Nationalist sides to negotiate peace terms. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th) Madrid: Madrid has fully returned to normal today. In addition to the tram service, which was restored yesterday, the subway coming from the west has also reopened. Shops have reopened, and women are lined up outside bakeries waiting to buy bread, as they have not been able to get bread for three or four days. Theaters and cinemas have also reopened. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th) Madrid: Colonel Casado recently told a Reuters reporter that reports that the Communist Party had launched an uprising in Cartagena were completely unfounded. The areas under the control of the Republican government are now completely peaceful. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Reports of Czechoslovakia's Dissolution are Rushed</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Newspapers recently used large headlines to publish news of "The Complete Dissolution of Czechoslovakia." Observers familiar with the situation expect that the independent state of Slovakia will be directly controlled by Germany, and Germany will make up for the budget deficit. As for the Czech core territory, namely Bohemia and Moravia, it will be temporarily occupied by German troops until the Germans in those provinces can enjoy all kinds of rights. In addition, Carpathian Ruthenia will be ceded to Hungary, regardless of whether the Ukrainian people resist. Although German officials are quite secretive about this, Hungary's advance into the province has probably been approved by the German government. In short, the situation in Europe will become more tense due to the Mediterranean issue and the colonial issue. The German government is eager to seek the sympathy of Poland and Hungary. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the situation in Czechoslovakia, external reports state that the German government has presented the country with an ultimatum. Official sources here say they know nothing about it. It is rumored that Germany has been mobilizing troops on the border of Czechoslovakia. Although this has been denied, it is still widely rumored. Observers are currently commenting that the German government has been greatly disappointed with the attitude of the Czechoslovak government since June, and has now decided to change the situation created by the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration (the arbitration on the demarcation of the border between Czechoslovakia and Hungary), and will take decisive measures to change the current federal system. If the province of Slovakia declares independence, then Carpathian Ukraine will be completely separated from other parts of Czechoslovakia and will not be able to exist independently. It is only possible to cede it to Hungary. If so, Poland will not have to fear the Pan-Ukrainian movement, and Poland's desire to be connected to Hungarian territory can be fulfilled. (Havas dispatch on the 13th) (Berlin) The situation in Czechoslovakia was recently commented on by people close to the German Foreign Ministry, saying that the domestic situation in the country is extremely chaotic. The faction of former President Benes, encouraged by U.S. President Roosevelt, wants to take back the autonomy rights previously granted to the Slovak and Ukrainian peoples. The Czechs have not yet understood the lessons they have learned in June, which can be seen from this. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>

German Ambassador to Poland Moltke returned to Berlin this morning after a lengthy conversation with Foreign Minister Beck yesterday. (Havas, March 14)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Responsible sources here have confirmed that Hungarian troops have entered Czech territory.

<p>(Vienna) It is widely expected that German troops will enter Slovak territory within hours. Traffic in Vienna almost came to a standstill this morning, with fully armed troops passing through the city in a continuous stream towards the Slovak border. When a Reuters reporter asked a German official whether German troops had begun to occupy or invade Slovakia, he replied, "Not yet, but it is to be expected." (Reuters, March 14)</p>
<p>Czech Capital: German army mechanized units were concentrated last night in Petržalka (opposite Bratislava across the Danube River). Members of the country's National Socialist Party's defense force are also reportedly concentrated on the northern and southern sides of Czech Moravia, with many armored vehicles and tanks.

A Hungarian official statement accused Czechs of attacking Hungarian border guards, claiming that several Czechs have been captured and fighting is ongoing. Recent border clashes have been mostly initiated by Ukrainian National Party members attacking Hungarians. Hungarian troops have now occupied the village of Podhering, two miles north of Munkács. (Reuters, March 14)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: The Army General Staff issued a statement regarding the border dispute in Munkács, stating that at 7:30 AM today, several Ukrainian and Czech soldiers from Czechoslovakia entered our territory, intending to blow up railway tracks. Our border guard soldiers immediately opened fire, and the Czech soldiers returned fire. A dense exchange of gunfire ensued, mixed with machine gun fire. Our soldiers were then assisted by local troops. Engagements continued until 9:00 AM. Near Munkács, Ukrainian terrorists and Czech soldiers attacked our border guards again, but were repelled. Two of our soldiers were seriously wounded. The number of Czech casualties is unknown. (Havas, March 14)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Political figures here are extremely indignant after the border dispute in Munkács, saying that the issue of the Carpathian Ukrainian Province must be resolved immediately and thoroughly.

(Havas, March 14) Hungarian Capital: A semi-official statement says, "Due to the special circumstances, it is necessary to take extraordinary measures to cope. In addition to the annual regular conscription of reservists, the government has also separately convened a batch of reservists, with a quota of only a few thousand." (Havas, March 14)</p>

<h3>Diplomatic Activities</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps this afternoon to discuss the situation in Czechoslovakia. Responsible sources say that although the Munich Agreement contained a clause stating that the borders of Czechoslovakia should be guaranteed by Britain and France, this clause has not yet come into effect due to certain conditions not being met. Therefore, no matter how the situation in Czechoslovakia evolves in the future, Britain and France have no intention of intervening. (Havas, March 13)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Czech Envoy Mastny and British Ambassador Sir Nevile Henderson visited the German Foreign Ministry one after the other yesterday afternoon, but were not received on the grounds that important meetings were being held.

<h3>Stalin's Report (Continued, Part 3)</h3>
<p>"In terms of production technology and the speed of industrial development, we have surpassed the major capitalist countries, which is very good, but still not enough. We must also surpass them economically. We can do this, and we must do it. Only by economically surpassing other major capitalist countries can our country have a large number of consumer goods and products, allowing us to transition from the first stage of communism to the second.</p>
<p>Agriculture has also steadily increased during this period. This increase is not only reflected in the increase in agricultural products, but also in the increase in socialist agriculture and the reduction in private agriculture. The grain production of collective farms increased from 7.5 million hectares in 1933 to 9.2 million hectares in 1938. Private production decreased from 5.7 million hectares in 1933 to 600,000 hectares in 1938. Collective farms now include 18.8 million farm households, accounting for 93.50% of the total. This number does not include collective fishing grounds and collective handicrafts. This proves that collective farms have become strong and stable, and the socialist system is the most suitable farm system for our country.</p>
<p>Stalin then listed figures to illustrate the cultivated area and equipment of collective farms, electric plows, harvesters, and other machines of state farms. The number of electric plows used was 210,900 in 1933, 276,400 in 1934, 360,300 in 1935, 422,700 in 1936, 454,500 in 1937, and 483,500 in 1938, an increase of more than 100% in six years. The number of harvesters in 1933 was 25,400, and in 1938 it was 153,500, an increase of more than 500%.</p>
<p>Stalin said that our country's agriculture is consistently ranked first in the world, being the most mechanized agriculture in the world, and therefore has the largest market in the world. At the same time, it also uses the most machines compared to other countries.</p>
<p>The progress of industry and agriculture is accompanied by the development of domestic trade.</p>
<p>The business of national and collective trade increased by 178%, and the retail sales of collective farms increased by 112%.</p>
<p>The progress of workers and peasants will lead to an increase in the standard of living, and this is indeed the case.</p>
<p>The phenomena of unemployment, homeless farmers wandering and starving to death, and begging for relief no longer exist. This period has long passed. Today, we may as well ask collective farms to produce at least 1.5 million young collective farmers each year for industrial production. Collective farms are very wealthy, and it should be remembered that without their assistance, our country's industry would be difficult to develop. And if industry does not develop, the industrial products needed by farmers cannot be satisfied. With the full development of their skills, they should be able to supply a part of their labor force for industrial use. The use of this labor force in industry will be a great gain for the national economy. The country's total revenue was 48.5 billion rubles in 1933 and 105 billion rubles in 1938. The number of workers and employees was more than 22 million in 1933 and 28 million in 1938. The annual salaries of workers and employees increased from 24.953 billion rubles in 1933 to 92.425 billion rubles in 1938. "In 1933, the average annual salary per industrial worker was 1,513 rubles, which increased to 3,447 rubles in 1938. In 1933, the total cash income of collective farms was 5,661.9 million rubles, which increased to 14,180.1 million rubles in 1937. In 1933, each collective farmer in the grain area received 61 poods of grain, which increased to 144 poods in 1937, excluding emergency reserve seeds, fodder for special livestock, grain taxes, and in-kind goods for remuneration of machine tractor station work." The expenditure on special items and cultural development in the national budget increased from 5,839.9 million rubles in 1933 to 35,202.5 million rubles in 1938. The cultural development of the people during this period is equivalent to a cultural revolution. The popularization of applied national languages and compulsory primary education have been implemented nationwide. The number of schools at all levels has increased countless times, and the number of students has also increased significantly. The number of specialized talents who have received university education is increasing day by day. A new Soviet intelligentsia has been produced and consolidated. The emergence of this new socialist, people's intelligentsia is the most important achievement of our country's cultural revolution.</p>
<p>"In addition, one of the most important achievements during this period is the further consolidation of the domestic status and the further consolidation of the Soviet regime. The characteristic that distinguishes Soviet society from any capitalist society at present is that there are no conflicting or opposing classes within it, the exploiting classes have been eliminated, and the workers, peasants, and intellectuals who constitute this society live and work on the basis of mutual harmony and cooperation. It is on this basis that various forces such as the moral and political unity of Soviet society, the friendship of all nationalities, and Soviet patriotism are able to develop. It is on this basis that the Soviet Constitution, passed in November 1936, and the thorough democratization of the elections of the highest organs in the country were produced. Due to this purity and internal unity, the rear and front lines of the Red Army in wartime will be stronger than any country. This is what those abroad who prefer armed conflict must remember."</p>
<p>"Some foreign newspaper spokespersons have spread absurd rumors, claiming that the purge of spies, assassins, and saboteurs such as Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Yakir, Tukhachevsky, Rosenholz, and Bukharin from Soviet organizations has 'weakened the strength of the Soviet regime' and caused turmoil. This kind of nonsense is laughable. In common sense, shouldn't the purge of such spies, assassins, and saboteurs from Soviet organizations make those organizations stronger? Even the Lake Khasan incident cannot prove that purging spies and saboteurs is the best way to strengthen the aforementioned organizations." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Czech President and Foreign Minister Fly to Berlin Together; Slovak Leader Visits Hitler to Seek Assistance</h3>
<p>Czech Capital: President Hácha has flown to Berlin with Foreign Minister Chvalkovský to meet with Führer Hitler. (Havas, March 14)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Former Prime Minister Tiso of the Slovak Province of Czechoslovakia, accompanied by former Minister of Transport Ďurčanský and German Party leader Karmasin of the Slovak Province, paid homage to Führer Hitler at 5:00 PM today to discuss the situation in Czechoslovakia. According to a communiqué issued afterwards, "Führer Hitler, together with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, received Slovak Prime Minister Tiso and Minister of Transport Ďurčanský this afternoon and held talks on current issues." Observers here commented that the new government of the Slovak Province has not yet been recognized by Germany, as can be seen from the wording of the communiqué. In addition, the German government is expected to send a note to the Czech government demanding two things: (1) the restoration of the Tiso cabinet; and (2) the dismissal of Czech central government cabinet members responsible for the incident, especially Defense Minister General Jansa and Czech Autonomous Government Prime Minister and Interior Minister Fiala. (Havas, March 13) Bratislava: The Slovak Autonomous Party in this city held a demonstration near the Carlton Hotel this afternoon, demanding independence for the province. About 1,500 people participated. The party's 200-member defense force also participated in uniform, attracting much attention. Party leader Sano Mach delivered a speech, stating that "The central government's sudden order on the 10th of this month to reorganize the autonomous government of this province is inappropriate. If the relationship between the Czech and Slovak peoples is to be thoroughly resolved, there is no other way but Slovak independence." In addition, an explosion occurred near the office of the Aza Newspaper, but there were no casualties. Police are patrolling all major thoroughfares to maintain order. The city is generally peaceful. (Havas, March 13)</p>
<p>Bratislava: A bomb explosion occurred in front of the city hall of this city at 10:15 PM, killing six people. (Havas, March 13) (Berlin) A certain official here told a Reuters reporter that Germany had not presented an ultimatum to the Czech government and had not had any direct contact with the Czech government. (Reuters, March 14)</p>
<h3>Soviet Communist Party Congress Discusses the Situation in Ukraine, All People of the Republic Support Stalin and Will Resolutely Strike Down Any Invaders</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The 18th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party continued yesterday. First, the secretary of the Central Executive Committee of the party, Khrushchev, delivered a speech explaining the national economic development and the cultural facilities of the Ukrainian Republic. "The people of the Ukrainian Republic have achieved unprecedented unity centered on the Communist Party and Stalin. Any fascist aggressors who dare to attack will inevitably encounter a powerful counterattack." The People's Commissar of Defense, General Voroshilov, then spoke, reporting on various measures taken by the government to strengthen national defense. All the representatives applauded warmly after hearing this, expressing their welcome. In addition, General Stern, commander of the First Far Eastern Army Group, also delivered a speech, detailing the combat situation of the Red Army during the Zhanggufeng Incident. (Havas dispatch from the 14th) (Moscow) Khrushchev said in his speech, "We have heard the report of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in the Congress. Soviet Ukraine is rich in infinite treasures, with countless coal, manganese, wheat, beet, cotton, etc. However, the greatest resource of Ukraine is still its freedom-loving people. In the past, various adventurers have attempted to enslave the Ukrainian people, but the fate of the German knights and Polish gentry will be a lesson for all such delusions in the future. The Ukrainian people have repelled such arrogance more than once, but they seem to have forgotten the past. Fascist bandits are now sending spies into our territory and buying traitors in the hope of realizing their dreams. They should know that we will thoroughly annihilate them, like poisonous insects and beasts." "During the Second Five-Year Plan, the production of pig iron in Ukraine has increased by two and a half times. The output of the Kirov Iron and Steel Plant alone is twice the total steel production of Poland. The steel produced in the entire Ukraine is equal to the sum of Japan, Italy, and Poland. The coal produced in Ukraine is also twice that of Poland. They should all seriously consider these facts. "Ninety-six point seven percent of Ukrainian farmers have joined collective farms, and the cultivated land of collective farms accounts for ninety-one point seven percent of the entire republic. Ukraine has sufficient agricultural machinery. In 1934, the cultivated land harvested by combine harvesters only accounted for two percent of the entire republic, but now it has reached fifty percent. The harvesting of beets has been mechanized. All of this has greatly shortened the time required to complete cultivation and made the actions of collective farmers easier. Animal husbandry has also developed. From 1924 to the present, cattle have increased by two times, sheep and goats have increased by more than two times, and pigs have almost tripled. The income of collective farmers has continued to increase. From 1934 to 1938, the cash income of farms increased to three and a half times, and the income distributed to farmers according to working days increased by more than five times. "We dare to declare to those fascist bandits who dream of Ukrainian wheat," "Don't dream of Ukrainian bread, because bread is what the Ukrainian people love. If you dare to intervene in our Soviet garden, we will respectfully greet you with our fists." "Ukrainian culture is also becoming increasingly prosperous. The funding for schools at all levels has increased from 14.1 million rubles in 1927 to 28.3 million rubles. The total salary of teachers has reached 11.06 million rubles. From 1933 to 1938, many schools have been added, especially middle schools, reaching 2,531, which is ten times that of 1932-33. The number of middle school students has also increased from 224,000 to 1,709,000 in the past five years." In 1914, Ukraine only had 19 higher education institutions with 26,000 students. Now, it has increased to 121 institutions with 122,000 students. During the First Five-Year Plan, a total of 39,000 specialized talents graduated from such schools, while during the Second Five-Year Plan, it reached 64,000. For hundreds of years, the Ukrainian people have fought with the Tsarist government for the right to study in their native language and develop their national culture. This aspiration was only realized after the victory of Lenin and Stalin's national policy. That is why the Ukrainian people shout "Long live Stalin!" (Warm applause). Now, the Ukrainian people are united as never before in supporting the Party and Stalin. All fascist aggressors will be crushed before this kind of unity. Once the Ukrainian people receive orders from the Party and the government, they will rise up to defend the socialist motherland. The unity of the Ukrainian people with the Russian nation and all the nations of the Soviet Union is a great and irresistible force. (TASS dispatch from the 14th)</p>

<h3>Population Increase and Transportation Inconvenience: Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces Are Planning to Regulate Food Supply</h3>
<p>Guangxi Rice Prices Expected to Stabilize, Guangdong Province Decides to Establish a Grain Management Office</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The grain issue is a major problem for Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The Liuzhou, Xunzhou, Wuzhou, and Yulin areas are known for surplus rice production. Every year, a large amount of grain and miscellaneous grains are produced, which, in addition to supplying the needs of the people in the entire area, is also exported in large quantities. The Guilin, Longzhou, and Baise areas have less production than the above areas, but if the weather is favorable, they can be self-sufficient in times of good harvests. In times of famine, they can rely on the transfer and assistance from the Liuzhou, Xunzhou, Wuzhou, and Yulin areas. The Guangxi provincial authorities often boast about their self-sufficiency policy, which is not without reason. However, since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, refugees from Hunan and Guangdong have flocked to Guangxi, resulting in a</p>
<p>sudden increase</p>
<p>of more than 2 million people in the population of Guangxi. The refugees from other provinces mostly reside between Guilin and Liuzhou. Guilin has historically been deficient in grain. Once the population increases dramatically, the demand for grain naturally exceeds the supply. As for the Longzhou and Baise areas above Nanning, the land is barren and not known for surplus rice production. In peaceful times, every spring, they feel a shortage of grain and must rely on continuous transportation and assistance from other areas. Now, with the tension of the war of resistance, the rivers and roads connecting the Guangdong border have all been destroyed. The policy of clearing the fields is strictly enforced, making grain transportation difficult. Even with assistance, the transportation costs are very high, which has led to a gradual increase in grain prices. According to the Guilin grain price report for this month, the price of good rice is 18 to 20 yuan per hundred pounds, and glutinous rice is 27 to 30 yuan per hundred pounds. The prices in Longzhou and Baise areas are about 10% to 15% lower than those in Guilin, and the prices in Xunzhou and Yulin areas are about 30% to 50% lower than those in Guilin. The huge difference in prices is due to the destruction of roads in various areas, the inconvenience of transportation, the increase in population, the shortage of production, and the slight drought in the upper reaches of the major rivers in the autumn. The people have little surplus grain in storage. The authorities are now</p>
<p>regulating the grain supply.</p>
<p>On the one hand, they are allocating huge sums of money and ships to purchase a large amount of grain from the Liuzhou, Wuzhou, and Yulin areas, transport it to the upper reaches for storage and sale, in order to suppress rice prices and prepare for famine. On the other hand, they are restricting wealthy people in various counties from hoarding grain and prohibiting rice merchants from monopolizing. However, looking at the overall grain problem in Guangxi, the shortage is only in a dozen remote counties. With some regulation by the authorities, the serious situation can be prevented from expanding. Moreover, farmers can still cultivate their land as usual, which makes it easier to maintain the grain supply than in other war zones. However, the situation is different in Guangdong Province. Many counties in the East, West, and North Rivers of Guangdong have been occupied by the Japanese army, causing chaos, traffic congestion, unrest for businesses, and insecurity for farmers. The grain problem is extremely serious. Currently, the price of rice in Guangzhou is only four and a half to five catties per one yuan of national currency. The rice prices in the occupied areas of Foshan, Chencun, Daliang, Guanshan, Jiujiang, and Sanshui are similar to those in Guangzhou. The grain prices in Zhaoqing, Jiangmen, and Siyi, which are adjacent to the war zone, are cheaper than those in the occupied areas, but still only about six and a half catties per yuan. Although Yingde and Shaoguan on the North River rely on</p>
<p>the import of Hunan rice,</p>
<p>the upper reaches of the North River are heavily garrisoned, and the demand for grain is higher than in other areas, so rice prices remain high. Chaozhou and Shantou and the East River can still transport foreign rice through the Youxia Port, which is connected to Hong Kong. However, the Chaozhou area lacks about 3 million piculs of rice every year, and the rice tax is too expensive, making the cost higher. Therefore, the supply of foreign rice is also difficult. Guangdong has always been a grain-deficient province. In normal times, it also relied on a large amount of imported foreign rice. Now, during the war of resistance, the coastal ports are often blockaded or harassed by Japanese warships, resulting in the interruption or reduction of foreign rice sources, which has put the entire province in a state of famine. Recently, it was reported that the chairman of the provincial government, Li Hanshun, ordered the abolition of the original Food Committee and the establishment of a Provincial Grain Management Office to comprehensively handle the grain affairs of the military and civilians in the province. At the moment when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in, the surplus rice areas in Guangdong have been emptied by unscrupulous merchants, and other areas are facing transportation difficulties due to traffic congestion. Grain prices are rising day by day, and the people are increasingly lacking food. It is hoped that those in charge of local affairs will urgently solve this serious problem.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Sail to Gaogang, Landing Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: A Japanese warship sailed from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to Gaogang, Taixing on the morning of the 8th and docked in the river. At around 10 o'clock, a dozen Japanese soldiers landed in Gaogang. However, due to the strict defenses of the Chinese army, they returned to the warship at around 12 o'clock. In the afternoon, at around 3 o'clock, the warship moved to the west of Gaogang, but there was no further action. Also, on the morning of the 8th, Japanese troops in Yangzhou successively moved to Xishan, totaling more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops, and another 70 to 80 cavalry. On the 9th, they moved to Tianchang and Liuhe to strengthen defenses. Japanese troops in Xiannvmiao recently inspected the mail and detained and burned most of the mail sent from the post office to the un-occupied areas of the Chinese side.</p>
<h3>Situation in Northern Jiangsu Eases, Recapture of Siyang Reported</h3>
<p>Part of the Puppet Army in Nantong Defects</p>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: Japanese troops in northern Jiangsu have repeatedly attempted to invade Huaiyin but have been bravely resisted and repelled by the Chinese army. In recent days, Japanese troops have again attempted to invade the south, repeatedly bombing Huaiyin. The long-distance telephone line between Qinghe and Taizhou was also damaged, and the situation suddenly became tense. One day, after a brave counterattack by a certain unit of the Chinese army, it was said that Siyang had been recaptured by the Chinese army. The long-distance telephone line between Qinghe and Taizhou has also been repaired and can resume normal communication, so the situation has eased again.</p>
<p>The guerrillas in northern Jiangsu have been reorganized by Gu Zhutong, and regular army units have been transferred to participate, and their momentum is growing. A few days ago, 300 puppet troops were causing disturbances in the countryside of Nantong. The people of various villages, fearing their power, fled to take refuge. When the puppet troops arrived at Jinsha Town, they were unexpectedly attacked by Chinese guerrillas. Troops from nearby towns also reportedly went to support the attack. The puppet troops were outnumbered and abandoned their guns and fled. Those who failed to escape from the town were captured, and a portion of the puppet troops defected and surrendered, shouting slogans such as "Long live the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>The Devastated Jiangnan and Jiangbei: Many Cultural Relics in Jiangnan Have Been Reduced to Ashes, Northern Jiangsu Still Has a Clean Land</h3>
<p>The suffering of the Jiangnan area of Jiangsu Province after its fall has been seen in various newspapers. The reporter will now record the recent situation in various counties as follows:</p>
<p>Changshu Scenery</p>
<p>In Changshu, Jiangnan, the people are very wealthy. It is not uncommon for ordinary families to have assets of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan. Therefore, all the houses that were damaged by the war in the urban area have been gradually repaired. Factories and shops have also resumed business one after another, with the cloth factories being the most prosperous. This abnormal development is due to their purchase of large quantities of foreign yarn in Shanghai, which they transport to Qincheng by car. Under the control of the Japanese army, they recruit workers to dye and weave, and then transport them to Shanghai for sale. There are dozens of such factories in the urban area of Changshu. Although the interest is good, the transportation of goods by car from Shanghai to Changshu is sometimes attacked by guerrillas, which makes these merchants who intend to make a fortune from the national crisis somewhat fearful. Otherwise, Changshu's factories will occupy the top spot in Jiangnan. At the same time, the "special goods" business in Changshu is also developing abnormally due to the unimpeded flow.</p>
<p>Jiangyin Status</p>
<p>Jiangyin is located 100 li northwest of Changshu, bordering the Yangtze River. The city is fortified and the people are simple. The primary rural sideline is cloth making. The goods are now transported to Shanghai, mostly sold to Ningbo and Shaoxing, and as far as the Nanyang Islands. Those transported to Jiangbei are sold to Tongzhou and Yangzhou, as well as Dongtai, Yancheng, and Xinghua. Cotton is produced in the Dongxiang Shazhou area. In previous years, the price was about 12 yuan per package. Although the harvest was poor this year, the price of cotton is twice that of previous years. Moreover, because there is no obstruction to the cultivation, the people's lives are not in panic. The western countryside lacks rural sidelines and relies only on agricultural products and small businesses for a living. Therefore, financial flow is slower than in the eastern countryside, and people's lives are also more difficult. Education and other undertakings are not as developed as in the eastern countryside. At present, the urban area of Jiangyin has become a dead city. In addition to some merchants who are officials in the puppet organization, the rest are effectively hiding in the city.</p>
<p>Changzhou and Wuxi After the Disaster</p>
<p>Suzhou and Wuxi counties have always been known as areas with developed industry and commerce. On average, people's lives are better than in other places. In Wuxi, except for some people who set up shops in the urban and rural areas to engage in small businesses, most of the people in the rural areas who have some farmland are living in seclusion and eating their savings. In the Wujin area, the guerrillas in the northwest countryside have been organized for a long time and are in order. There are also many people who sell cattle, sheep, and livestock. In the southern countryside, such as the area east of Lake Gehu, rice production is famous. Japanese troops are stationed in the urban area of Yixing, and the Chinese army uses the mountains as a stronghold, with strict defenses. Many merchants in Chengjiang, Wuxi, and Wujin venture to the area to collect and sell rice, because the interest is higher. Therefore, since last year, the traffic has been constant. They concentrate their exports, mostly in Donglai Town, Dongxiang, Jiangyin, and transport them to Shanghai. Gaochun relies on the danger of Lake Shijiu in the north and Lake Gucheng in the south. A large Chinese army is gathered, waiting for an opportunity to attack.</p>
<p>Yangzhou in Stalemate</p>
<p>Yangzhou fell on December 15, 1937. Patriotic people rose up one after another, and the fighting has been deadlocked in the Zhaoguan Dam and Xiannvmiao area. In such an environment, the people have successively infiltrated various places to engage in organization, and the various organizations related to the puppet side in the city have gradually faded away and disappeared invisibly. By the end of February 1938, there was a fierce battle near the bridge. The two sides are still in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Tongzhou and Rugao</p>
<p>Tongzhou fell on March 17, 1938, and Rugao continued to fall on the 19th. The Japanese army's attack on Nantong did not involve a particularly fierce battle, so the slaughter and burning were less than in other counties in Jiangnan. Due to the fall of Nantong, the neighboring counties were alarmed. In order to prevent themselves from encountering the same situation, the people of northern Jiangsu became more aroused. This resulted in the Japanese army, which had already invaded Nantong, Rugao and other places, only being able to occupy one urban area and unable to develop further.</p>
<p>Jingjiang Situation</p>
<p>Jingjiang fell, and the puppet magistrate of the county, Yuan Luchen, due to the threat of the Chinese army from three sides, and the Japanese army's defense was not very solid, and the city was small and low, in order to protect himself, recruited more than 100 bandits and filled the ranks of the puppet army. Jingjiang City is 18 li from Bajiang Port on the river, all of which are cobblestone roads. There are several to dozens of Japanese troops stationed at Bajiang Port, inspecting travelers. At present, small skirmishes of guerrillas occur from time to time in the Jiangbei Huangqiao, Jijiashi, and Guanglingzhen areas. The source of the Japanese troops is Jingjiang.</p>
<p>Taixian is Crowded</p>
<p>The refugees who have been repeatedly displaced have mostly gathered in Taixian. According to statistics at the end of February 1939, in addition to the refugees who have been repatriated, there are still more than 9,000 people living in the refugee camps. Therefore, the population of Taixian suddenly increased by more than 30,000 people during this period. The accents heard on the streets are mostly from Jiangnan, such as Wujin, Jiangyin, and Wuxi counties. There are also many from Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Changshu. In the 1,000 li water village north of Taixian and south of Xinghua, there are many homeless people.</p>
<p>People's Livelihood in Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>As for the people's livelihood in northern Jiangsu, it is very simple. Except for a few people in the towns who specialize in commerce, most of them rely on coolie labor and agriculture for a living. Some of the people in the counties near the river work as coolies in the Jiangnan counties, some rely on small boats to travel to various places to do small business, and some grow crops at home. Their agricultural products include reeds from the mud flats, radishes, soybeans, and yellow beans. Rice and wheat are second. Their daily food, such as millet and yellow radishes, is quite simple. In the 1,000 li water village north of Taixian and south of Xinghua, most families raise ducks, because they are easier to raise. The duck eggs sold in Shanghai are mostly transported from there. In March and April of last year, due to the closure of Tiangong Port, eggs could not be transported out. The Lower River area produces a lot of rice. After the battle in Xiannvmiao, Yangzhou, the rice market has invisibly shifted to Datong. Because of the abundance of agricultural products in the Lower River area, people's lives are better than in other places. Because of the good life, people's thoughts tend to be stable. From Yancheng to Dongtai, there are many salt workers. Because the rainfall is relatively sparse, and the water in the Yuehe River contains a lot of alkali, which is bitter and difficult to drink, the wealthier households place large vats under the eaves to collect rainwater for drinking. This is a general description of the people's livelihood in Jiangbei.</p>
<h3>Pan American Giant Aircraft Arrives in Hong Kong, Will Officially Open Soon</h3>
<p>Can Accommodate 72 People with Restaurant, Bedroom, and Other Facilities</p>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The new Boeing 74 passenger giant aircraft of Pan American Airlines has arrived in Hong Kong on a trial flight from the United States. Despite the wind resistance in Kandia, it arrived safely in Hong Kong on the 3rd after departing from the Philippines. At one time, the officers, gentry, Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen of Hong Kong went to visit. It is verified that this arrival of the aircraft in Hong Kong has added a valuable page to the history of Pacific aviation. Its beauty and comfort, the magnificent decoration and the unprecedented size of the aircraft, are all considered to be era-making works. The arrival of the aircraft in Hong Kong and its facilities are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Slow Descent</p>
<p>The type aircraft took off from Little Luzon at 7:39 a.m. on the 3rd. When it was about to arrive in Hong Kong, it suddenly encountered thick fog, which was inconvenient for travel. It was forced to retreat. After slightly clearing the sky, it continued to fly and arrived in Hong Kong airspace at about 1 p.m. At this time, the airport clock rang loudly, and the spectators waiting on the coast of Kai Tak knew that the plane had arrived. Looking into the distance, this aerial monster had appeared on the low air above the sea. It was shaped like a fish, and then flew west along the coast, circling Hong Kong Island for a week, and then landed. At this time, it was 2:10 p.m. After the plane docked at the sea, the personnel on the plane landed in an orderly manner. Chinese and foreign photographers scrambled to take pictures, and the audience frequently congratulated the captain. The surroundings were filled with joyful air.</p>
<p>Captain Talks</p>
<p>The reporter interviewed Captain Qiao Fu at the Kai Tak Pier. According to the interview, the weather was quite good along the way, but it encountered fog when it was approaching Hong Kong. The average speed was 160 miles per hour, and the altitude was about 8,000 feet. When it was approaching Hong Kong, it turned back due to fog and then continued to fly to Hong Kong. It took off from Manila at 7:30 a.m. If it had not encountered fog, it would have arrived in Hong Kong at 11:30 a.m. It is verified that the aircraft did not carry passengers on this trip. In addition to the crew, there were 24 technicians. The aircraft is scheduled to return to the United States the next day, and will officially open to Hong Kong on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Interior Furnishings</p>
<p>The aircraft has two decks and 18 rooms, covered with luxurious carpets. The four sides have sofas and chairs against the walls, and the luxurious equipment is just like the residence of a wealthy man on Park Avenue in New York. Install two wings and fly in the air. Walking along the escalator into the Boeing plane, you first step onto the deck. The deck was originally for guests to get on and off, but the deck below is an oil storage pool, storing 1,500 gallons of oil. Open the horizontal door, and three steps down is the restaurant, with an area of 10 and a half feet wide and 12 feet long. All the furniture and utensils have colored patterns. The walls are silver-colored and equipped with "living block" curtains. There are five dining tables, and 14 people can dine at the same time. If the restaurant is not used for dining, it can be used as a meeting and entertainment. At the same time, if the aircraft does not take long-distance flights and changes to short-distance flights, the living room can be converted into a bedroom when there are more passengers. At this time, the whole aircraft can accommodate 40 passengers. There are two lanes in front and behind the restaurant, leading to the bedroom. There are three bedrooms, with a volume of 7 and a half feet wide, 12 feet long, and 7 feet high. The room is equipped with soundproof panels, so there is no need to worry about aircraft noise. The front and rear bedrooms can accommodate 10 guests. Each berth has its own electric light for reading, a ventilator, an electric bell clothes rack, etc., and they are all close to the windows that can look outside. On the left side of the stern is a four-person bedroom, next to the ladies' dressing room. There is a washbasin on the left of the door, a large mirror, hot and cold water taps, and a table for toothbrushes. There are two rows of dressing tables leaning against the outside.

<h3>Foreign Reporters' Description of the Japanese Army's Plight</h3>
<p>Anti-War Thought Spreads, Internal Turmoil and Unease</p>
<p>According to the New York, USA, communication, the February issue of The Commentator here recently published an article written by Mr. Hauser entitled (The Day the Daydream Awoke), which describes the author's personal observations of the plight of Japanese soldiers in Japan and the phenomenon of spreading anti-war thought and internal turmoil. It first mentions a wounded soldier who was sent back to China from the front. Because the soldier had broken his legs and arms, he was placed in a bass bucket. The soldier sought death but failed, so he bit his tongue and committed suicide. The Japanese newspapers absolutely prohibited the publication of this news, but almost everyone in the country, from Hokkaido to Kagoshima, knew about this. Secondly, it describes the tragic situation of Japanese soldiers going on expeditions and the control of war news in the country. What the general public sees in the newspapers every day are reports such as □□部队, 在□□少尉之下, 于口晚口晨之前, 由阵地前进, 至口口占领有城 之城, 使敌受重大损失, 我无死伤之类电讯, and no one knows what □□ represents. Once, a soldier on the front line in China wrote to his relatives and friends about the situation on the battlefield and the suffering of food shortages, which was confiscated by the authorities, resulting in what is called "front-line mail" that cannot reach the recipients. There is also the strange thing about the so-called condolence bag. The military department, in order to encourage the soldiers on the front line, sent whiskey, cigarettes, soap, toothbrushes, books and other items to the front line for condolences. In the condolence bag, there were anonymous letters of anti-revolutionary revolution, advising the soldiers to stop fighting and return home to support their wives and children. This was done by college students. Because it was discovered by the police, the condolence bag was also strictly prohibited. The reasons for the mutiny of the Japanese army on the Yangtze River front line in China are roughly as follows: the Japanese army is insufficient in strength, and the wounded soldiers have not recovered, and they are reopened on the front line. Therefore, the wounds have not healed, and the medical officers are repeatedly pressing them to return to the front line. In the Yangtze River area, the Japanese army suffered particularly heavy losses. This situation can be seen everywhere. Thirdly, it describes the illegal acts of the Japanese army in the occupied areas, such as rape, burning, killing, looting, torture, etc., and the strong resistance of the villagers in the occupied counties of China, and the situation of conscription rebellion. He also describes the disheveled and embarrassed situation of the Japanese soldiers who returned to Japan in Shimonoseki and Osaka, and the uneasy state of mind. He predicted that the Japanese would be exhausted, and under the high tide of the warlords, a great revolution would inevitably break out in the near future. When the author was in Tokyo, he visited the largest army hospital, so the situation described is very true.</p>
<h3>Promoting Forestry in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Forests are crucial to the nation and an indispensable factor for national defense. Jiangxi's forestry has always been well-developed.

In addition to managing state-owned forests, attention will be paid to local forestry, encouraging private afforestation, promoting cooperative afforestation, and promoting afforestation in rural areas, townships, and Baojia systems. 2. Conduct surveys of forests and wasteland, and then focus on cultivating firs, larches, and other species suitable for building aircraft materials, as well as military timber.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Recapture Sijing</h3>
<p>Japanese Lieutenant Kawano Wounded</p>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: After driving the Japanese troops from Zhangyan and other places, the loyal and patriotic National Salvation Army of the Chinese side, led by Ding Xishan, led his troops to the Dama Mountain and Xiaokun Mountain area, where they joined forces with the guerrillas and attacked Songjiang. When they reached the vicinity of Chenjing Bridge, they engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese garrison Kawano unit in Sijing for about two hours. The Japanese army was completely defeated and in a terrible state, with heavy casualties along the way. Lieutenant Kawano was hit by several bullets and was carried away by Japanese soldiers. Taking advantage of the victory, Ding's troops recaptured Sijing and are now preparing to attack Songjiang as a group. At the same time, the Japanese Nakajima unit in Nanqiao has been repeatedly attacked by the mobile unit of Chuan Shengchang, which is active in the Qianjiaqiao area, and is extremely panicked. In addition, Nanqiao has no defenses, so it has withdrawn to the outskirts of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Second Anti-Japanese Propaganda Week: Education Sector Propaganda Day Today</h3>
<p>Educational Organizations Issue Declarations to Strive for the Three Principles of the People Education</p>
<p>Today is the fourth day of the Anti-Japanese Propaganda Week held by the Shanghai Special City Party Department leading all sectors of society. Educational organizations in the city have issued a declaration and sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang, expressing their support for the Chairman's instructions at the National Education Conference. The following is a verbatim record:</p>
<p>Declaration of the Education Sector: Today is the Education Sector Propaganda Day of the first week of the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai. We feel that the task of the Anti-Japanese War in the later stage is even more arduous than in the previous stage, because education is a sharp weapon for resisting Japan and building the country. To resist Japan and build the country, the people must have a clear awareness, a firm determination, unified action, and lasting strength. All of this comes from education. At this time when the Anti-Japanese War is entering its second phase, the responsibilities that our Shanghai education sector should fulfill are even greater. We must base ourselves on the principles of the Three Principles of the People education, support Chairman Chiang's instructions at the Third National Education Conference, and support the declaration of the National Education Conference, so as to conduct an in-depth review of education in Shanghai in the future, study ways to improve and strengthen it, and adapt it to the needs of resisting Japan and building the country.</p>
<p>(1) Absolutely adhere to the educational purpose of the Three Principles of the People. Chairman Chiang instructed us at the National Education Conference, saying, "The revolutionary Three Principles of the People should be the highest standard for our country's education, and the program for resisting Japan and building the country should be implemented. The new vitality of modern countries is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings." We educators should deeply understand and sincerely abide by this guidance and enlightenment from the highest leader. The education sector in Shanghai unanimously takes the Three Principles of the People as a common belief. We should make the will of all students in the city as strong as steel, and the spirit of all young people as fiery as flames. Through the power of education, we should promote and encourage the revolutionary spirit of the people in the city, and increase the revolutionary enthusiasm for loving the motherland, so as to win the final victory of our nation and country.</p>
<p>(2) Absolutely support the declaration of the National Education Conference. The Third National Education Conference was held in Chongqing, the seat of the National Government, during this period of incursion by the enemy, and a declaration was issued to raise academic standards and meet the needs of resisting Japan and building the country. Based on the enlightenment of the Premier and the supreme leader, detailed and specific instructions were given on various aspects of higher education, secondary education, elementary education, normal education, and social education, in order to meet the needs of resisting Japan. After seeing the progress of this conference, we should work harder and actively forge ahead. In addition to adhering to the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle of education, we must absolutely support the declaration and resolutions of this National Education Conference. We must know that the success of resisting Japan and building the country depends on the efforts of our education sector, and we must not hesitate to make sacrifices.</p>
<p>(3) Absolutely support the leader's instructions at the National Education Conference. Chairman Chiang personally delivered instructions at the Third National Education Conference, explaining that the meeting was being held during a period of active resistance against Japan and national reconstruction. The mission and task of the meeting were to review the current situation in the education sector, study ways to improve or remedy it, solve the current difficult problems in education, and elaborate that the development of the economy and the enhancement of military power are based on education as the general hub, using the spirit of frugality and hard work to expand the effect of education, strengthen the will to resist Japan and build the country, and establish our spirit of actively building the country. It is necessary to create all students to have the awareness and ability to defend the country, defend themselves, govern themselves, and govern the country, so that education and military administration are integrated under the Three Principles of the People, united in one heart and one mind, and work hard for the Chinese revolution. We sincerely support the leader's instructions, and the national education sector should work together to promote the Three Principles of the People education, strengthen the national spirit and will to resist Japan, and strive for the final victory.</p>
<p>Finally, all of us in the education sector in the city should solemnly pledge today to strive to the end for the education of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang: Chongqing, Supreme Leader and President Chiang Junjian. Today, according to the regulations of the Municipal Party Department, it is the Education Sector Propaganda Day of the Anti-Japanese Propaganda Week. Educational organizations in Shanghai believe that anti-Japanese education is of great importance, and that promoting the spirit of the Party and cultivating cadres are the most urgent and important issues in current education. We respectfully read the instructions you gave at the National Education Conference, which are the highest principles for the national education sector to strive for during the Anti-Japanese War.

<h3>Overview of Border Education Conducted by Various Ministries and Commissions</h3>
<p>Subsidizing School Funds in Border Areas and Establishing Middle Schools in Xining, Suzhou, Yunnan, and Guizhou</p>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Border education was already roughly established before the war. The relocation of educational and cultural institutions to the interior after the war is the best opportunity to promote the development of border education. The following is a brief description of the border education conducted by various ministries and commissions over the years:</p>
<p>Ministry of Education: In order to actively promote border education, the Ministry of Education coordinated the work of various related agencies, formulated an overall implementation plan, convened a discussion on border education issues, and adopted the "Plan for Promoting Education in Border Provinces." The plan is divided into nine chapters: Chapter 1: Guiding Principles and Operating Principles; Chapter 2: Training and Further Education of Teachers; Chapter 3: Compilation of Teaching Materials; Chapter 4: Elementary Education; Chapter 5: Secondary Education; Chapter 6: Higher Education; Chapter 7: Social Education; Chapter 8: Encouraging Learning and Regional Supervision System; Chapter 9: Estimation of Funding. The entire plan contains concrete measures for border education facilities. In the future, the promotion of border education will adopt a system of simultaneous advancement by the central and local governments. Starting from the 28th year, a number of national normal schools, vocational schools, middle schools, and border experimental elementary schools will be established as centers for promotion. In addition, measures for treating Mongolian and Tibetan students and issuing subsidies have been revised separately. The Ministry of Education also believes that "Border Production Education" urgently needs to be emphasized, that "Communicating Chinese and Tibetan Culture" should be planned, and that "Organizing Border Inspection Groups to Engage in the Investigation and Research of Practical Border Issues" should be discussed and implemented with various experts. The entire border education should be considered as a whole. A border education committee has been organized to discuss and handle matters at any time. The Ministry of Education has established a Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Department. Over the years, it has subsidized school funds in border areas annually and subsidized Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui students to study in specialized schools and above in the interior, and has compiled various bilingual textbooks in Chinese, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui for teaching purposes.</p>
<p>Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission: In addition to jointly discussing border education plans and allocating Mongolian education funds with the Ministry of Education over the years, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission also runs the Beijing Mongolian and Tibetan School and the Mongolian and Tibetan Political Training Class.</p>
<p>Boxer Indemnity Fund Committee: The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Trustees established a science museum in Suzhou and runs middle schools in Xining, Suzhou, Yunnan, and Guizhou to help the development of border education.</p>
<p>In addition, the Central Political School has an affiliated Mongolian and Tibetan School and has established branch schools in various places. The Central Organization Department has also established border vocational schools to seek the implementation of production education.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee Meeting of the Education Group Fundraising Association</h3>
<p>Set a Deadline for Ending Fundraising Procedures and Organize a Production Education Committee</p>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Fundraising Committee of the Education Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. Yao Huiquan, Du Zuowen, Chen Jicheng, Xi Yushu, Chen Heqin, Wang Dagang, Zhao Chuanjia, Zhang Lingfei, Xu Renguang, Feng Shuhua, Feng Yixian, Jin Tongyin, Zhang Rongzhen, Chai Zifei, Lin Buji, Liu Chongben, Xu Peihang, Xue Zheng, Wu Zhiqian, Gu Yinqian, Ni Fengmei, Huang Zhongsu, Chen Xuanshan, Zhang Zhonghuan, Zhong Yiming, Yin Yiwen, Tao Guangchuan, Qian Weizong, Meng Jiancheng, Yu Chuanding, Cui Jianwu, Zhou Zefu, Shi Jiuyun, Gu Huiren, Sun Xiaolou, Ge Youren, Liang Zhongyuan, and others attended, presided over by Xi Yushu. Chairman Xi reported that the association's campaign to raise funds for refugee production education and promote the Charity Medal fundraising campaign began on the first of this month and will last until the tenth. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of all sectors, the association has achieved its set goals, which is very gratifying. The Shen Bao newspaper donated all the Charity Medals, worth more than 2,000 yuan. From the beginning of the preparations to the present, the personnel have been assisted voluntarily by colleagues from the Chinese Education Department of the Public Concession, the Shanghai Private Middle School, and the Public Trust Accounting Firm. The Shanghai Bank's head office and branches have helped to issue badges and collect donations, which is extremely laborious. All of these are deeply admirable. All necessary administrative expenses and the purchase of prizes have also been generously donated by major bookstores such as the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore. Therefore, the association has not used a single cent of the Charity Medal donations. Although the association's fundraising campaign has come to an end, the education and cultural sectors will continue to promote thrift and disaster relief work as a social example. The following motions were then discussed: (1) According to Item 3 of the association's reward method, the schools with the top five Charity Medal numbers will receive a plaque from the association's chairman in addition to the association's Charity Certificate. According to Item 4, the schools with the Charity Medal numbers ranking from sixth to tenth will receive a silver shield from the association's chairman in addition to the association's Charity Certificate. Because there are many schools with excellent fundraising results, it is proposed to expand the scope of rewards without limiting the number of places. It was resolved that all schools that raise more than 1,000 yuan will be awarded a plaque from the association's chairman, and those who raise more than 1,000 yuan will be awarded a silver shield from the chairman. (2) Regarding the proposal to set a deadline for ending fundraising procedures, it was resolved that fundraising and medal donations will be cut off uniformly on the 16th of this month (Thursday), and all schools should submit their donations by the 18th of this month (Saturday). (3) Regarding the proposal to organize a production education committee, it was resolved that Chen Heqin, Sun Xiaolou, and Yao Huiquan will be appointed as members to draft the organization and planning outline. (4) Regarding the proposal to review the association's donations, it was resolved that after all fundraising procedures have been completed, Wang Sifang, Wang Haifan, Bei Zuyi, and Shen Xuejun, standing members of the Accountants Association, and Xu Yinghao, a supervisory committee member, will be invited to review and announce the results. (5) It is the greatest joy to do good deeds. Now that the fundraising campaign is over, it is proposed to issue a closing declaration. It was resolved that Committee Member Chen Xuanshan will draft the declaration.</p>

<h3>Public Announcement by the Municipal Council Regarding Numerous Rumors: Content of Agreements Released Yesterday; Exercise of Authority Based on Land Regulations, Actual Searches Conducted by the Police Department</h3>
<p>Rumors of Japanese Military Police Establishing Offices in Police Stations are Baseless. The Municipal Council Information Office announced: Recent reports in the press regarding the agreements reached between the Council's Police Department and the Japanese Military Police have contained inaccuracies. In light of this, the Council believes it is appropriate to publicly disclose a summary of the negotiations.</p>
<p>Established Policy: Regarding acts of terror and violence occurring within the International Settlement, the Japanese authorities engaged in negotiations with the Council between February 22nd and March 3rd. The Council's position is outlined below: (1) Regarding anti-Japanese terrorist incidents, the Council has implemented the emergency measures announced on July 19, 1938, and is prepared to continue to do so. (2) Any proposal for a police agency other than the Council's Police Department to act independently within the International Settlement is unacceptable to the Council. The Council's police powers and responsibilities under the Land Regulations cannot be transferred to others without the approval of the relevant countries. However, the Council stated that it is prepared to continue to welcome cooperation from the Japanese Military Police and consular police in investigating terrorist activities. Any cooperation must be implemented with the consent of the Council's Police Commissioner and after consultation with him. (3) Prior to the commencement of these negotiations, the Council, in fulfilling its responsibility to prevent acts of violence, had already implemented searches of people entering the International Settlement by waterway. The Council is prepared to intensify these measures, and is also prepared to continue inviting Japanese plainclothes inspectors to be present during searches. (4) During this municipal year, the Council has newly recruited 45 police officers for the Japanese division of the Police Department. The Council has sought to recruit an additional 33 personnel from Japan to fill the quota stipulated in the budget. This has also been explained by the Council. (5) The Council stated that searches of important locations within the International Settlement are a normal and continuous function of the Council's Police Department. This work is currently being intensified.</p>
<p>Cooperation Methods: The Council's Police Commissioner held talks with Japanese officials to formulate detailed methods for implementing the aforementioned cooperation. The following points were decided during the talks: (1) Regarding the search of people entering the International Settlement by waterway, the Council's Police Department welcomes the cooperation of the Japanese Military Police and consular police, but the actual searches must be carried out by the Council's Police Department. (2) If the Japanese authorities receive information regarding the location of terrorists within the Settlement and provide concrete reasons, and the Council's Police Department believes that the reasons given are sufficient to justify restricting traffic in a certain area in order to conduct a search, then the Council's Police Department is prepared to cooperate in this way. (3) The Japanese side suggested establishing a mixed group within the existing Criminal Division organization, consisting of a senior Japanese police officer and several selected Japanese staff. The Council's Police Commissioner is prepared to give sympathetic consideration to this proposal. The proposed group must be integrated with the existing overall organization of the Police Department and become part of the Detective Division of Police Headquarters, under the command of the head of that division. The function of this group is to enable the Japanese authorities to have rapid liaison when necessary in the work of suppressing terrorists. (4) If a person is arrested for a terrorist incident based on information provided by the Japanese authorities, the Council's Police Department is prepared to generally provide facilities for interrogation if the Japanese side wishes to do so, but the Police Department reserves the right to handle each case individually. All difficult cases will be discussed by the two police agencies.</p>
<p>Certain newspapers have stated that the Japanese Military Police will establish offices in the various police stations of the Council's Police Department, or that Japanese Military Police will be stationed in the various police stations of the Council's Police Department. These reports are without foundation. In addition, there is another report stating that the Police Commissioner has agreed to place Chinese police officers under the supervision of the Japanese Military Police, which is also completely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Arbitrarily Arrest Chinese: Political Kidnappings; Police Department Completely Unaware in Advance, Japanese Personnel Absolutely Not Allowed to Act Freely</h3>
<p>The Continental Times reports that yesterday evening (the 11th), the Japanese side hosted reporters from various newspapers, and the embassy spokesperson, in answering questions, refused to comment on whether plainclothes Japanese military police had applied to the Municipal Council or obtained permission from the Council to take independent action in the International Settlement. It is rumored that since the 7th of this month, the Municipal Council's Police Department has arrested eight Chinese and handed them over to the Japanese authorities. Yesterday, the police authorities denied this, stating that there have been no incidents of this nature this year. However, the Police Department is aware of the illegal actions of plainclothes Japanese individuals who have kidnapped several Chinese in various locations within the International Settlement. It is understood that the number reaches eight or nine people, and it is generally believed that these are political kidnappings. It is reported that the Japanese side took this action without the permission or consent of the International Settlement Police Department, as the Police Department was completely unaware in advance and only learned of the kidnappings after they occurred. It is also rumored that the Police Department and the Japanese authorities recently reached an agreement stipulating that personnel appointed by the Japanese side may act freely. A police officer firmly denied this, stating that the Japanese military police have more freedom of action on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek because an agreement on different work arrangements has not yet been reached. The Municipal Council's Police Department only has the power to arrest people on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek, so plainclothes Japanese individuals arresting people on the south bank would violate any agreement reached between the Japanese side and the Police Department after the Chinese army moved west.</p>
<h3>Chen Guangfu</h3>
<p>Rumors of Succession as President of the Bank of China Are Incorrect. Yesterday, there were rumors that Chen Guangfu would succeed as President of the Central Bank. Yesterday, this reporter specifically visited someone close to Mr. Chen, who stated that Mr. Chen has been ill recently and is currently resting during his trip to the United States. He is also on leave from his position as General Manager of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank. The rumor of him succeeding as President of the Central Bank is not true.</p>
<h3>Relief Association Discourages Refugees from Returning to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>Maximally Receiving and Introducing Employment; Party and Police Organs Resolutely Discourage. In view of the fact that refugees fleeing from war zones in various places have been residing for a long time and facing livelihood difficulties, and that many poor people intend to return to their hometowns to make a living, the National Government, in order to correct this erroneous thinking, has specifically instructed the Relief Committee to resolutely discourage this and to find ways to provide refugees with stability in their lives, so as to directly alleviate the suffering of refugees in occupied areas and indirectly promote the development of the war of resistance. It is now understood that after receiving the order, the Relief Committee has formulated four measures: (1) Each province and city will establish as many shelters as possible to receive refugees fleeing from war zones. (2) Provincial and municipal governments will handle registration and engage in employment referrals for refugees. (3) Party headquarters at all levels will expose the tragic situation in occupied areas so that the public is aware of it. (4) Military and police forces in various locations will resolutely discourage refugees from returning to their hometowns at various transportation hubs. Circulars have been sent to each province and city to be relayed and followed.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong: Prices of All Goods Soar</h3>
<p>Pork at Thirty-Two Dollars per Picul; Chicken at Two Dollars and Twenty Cents per Catty</p>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, the cost of living in Hong Kong has risen due to transportation disruptions, causing the prices of all goods to soar. However, since the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, trade with Hong Kong has been greatly affected. The price of pork has risen from 24 Hong Kong dollars per picul to 32 dollars. The price of chicken and duck has also risen from 80 cents per catty to 2 dollars and 25 cents in Hong Kong currency.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Promotes Traffic Safety</h3>
<p>Safety Week to Be Held; Meeting Scheduled for the 21st</p>
<p>Due to the high number of traffic accidents in the International Settlement, the Traffic Department of the Municipal Council plans to hold a "Safety First" week in the near future to reduce accidents. It is hoped that various organizations concerned with this plan will provide assistance and cooperation. A meeting is scheduled for the 21st of this month at the Police Club on the eighth floor of the Central Police Station on Fourth Avenue, and representatives from various agencies are invited to attend.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Launches Tea Industry Loans</h3>
<p>Totaling Ten Million Yuan; The Zhejiang Provincial Government considers that Zhejiang Province produces a very large amount of tea annually. Since unified control of sales was implemented last year, both production and sales have increased. Now that spring has arrived, it is the season for tea farmers and merchants to process tea leaves. In order to support and develop increased production, the government has borrowed ten million yuan from the Zhejiang Local Bank for tea industry loans. The Local Bank has already agreed to lend five million yuan, and the remainder will be allocated by other banks. The Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to allocate the funds to the Wartime Trade Association and the Tea Sales Office for lending.</p>
<h3>Interference in Flag Hanging Incident: City Party Headquarters Expresses Solemnly; Has Reported to Central Government for Negotiation</h3>
<p>Regarding the interference by the French Concession authorities in the public's hanging of flags on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, which aroused public indignation and caused several disturbances, according to reports in the Continental Daily News and the English-language China Press, the French Concession authorities' interference in the hanging of flags was due to a notice issued to the public by the Shanghai City Party Headquarters, stating that flag hanging of a political nature would be interfered with. Regarding this matter, the Shanghai City Party Headquarters issued a statement yesterday, stating: Since the fall of Shanghai, the patriotism of the entire citizenry and their support for the national policy of resisting Japan have become even more pronounced. Every time there is a commemorative festival, the city is filled with national flags. This strong and unyielding spirit of the people is powerful evidence that our war of resistance will surely be victorious and our nation will surely be built. Before and after the westward movement of the National Army, the Party Headquarters has always issued instructions on commemorative methods for each commemorative festival so that the public can follow them uniformly, not only on this anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. The authorities' interference this time has aroused public indignation and caused several disturbances, which is deeply regrettable. According to the reports in the Continental Daily News and the English-language China Press, the reason why the authorities interfered with the public's hanging of flags was because it was of a political nature. This statement is very strange. It should be understood that the national flag is a symbol representing the nation, and is itself of a political nature. Interfering with a country's citizens hanging their national flag is tantamount to insulting that country. As for the so-called "pre-existing regulations," the citizens of Shanghai have never heard of them before. The true intention of the authorities in interfering with the hanging of flags is unknown. The Party Headquarters has telegraphed this matter to the Central Government and requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate.</p>
<h3>National Spiritual Mobilization: All Sectors Exert Themselves to Promote It; Pledge to Conscientiously Abide by National Covenant; Thrift Committee Earnestly Hopes Fellow Citizens Will Correct Their Lives</h3>
<p>President Chiang, concurrently Chairman of the National Defense Supreme Council, recognizing the importance of National Spiritual Mobilization, previously formulated the Outline for National Spiritual Mobilization, which was presented to and passed by the Fifth Central Plenary Session and the Second National Political Council. On the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death, President Chiang telegraphed the entire country to announce its implementation. All sectors in this city have expressed extreme support for the spirit of mobilization outline and implementation measures, and are currently gathering to discuss actively promoting it in order to achieve practical results, and will automatically pledge to abide by the National Covenant. The Thrift Movement Committee of this city also issued a letter to fellow citizens of the entire city yesterday. The details are recorded separately below. All Sectors Gather to Discuss Actively Promoting: After President Chiang telegraphed the entire country on the day of Sun Yat-sen's death to announce the implementation of National Spiritual Mobilization, all sectors in this city, after respectfully reading it, were extraordinarily excited. The Shanghai City Party Headquarters is currently drafting detailed implementation measures and will lead the citizens of the entire city to implement it consistently. At the same time, various organizations, agencies, trade associations, labor unions, etc., are also automatically gathering to discuss actively promoting measures, determined to uphold the supreme principles of nationalism and national supremacy, and to concentrate will, concentrate strength, and fight together with military first and victory first as the sole guiding principles. As for the education and youth sectors, they are organizing a National Spiritual Mobilization Coordination Association to be responsible for presiding over and executing the affairs.</p>
<p>Pledge to Abide by the National Covenant: Furthermore, according to a reporter from the Modern Society, after inquiring with various trade organizations, all sectors in this city have decided to automatically convene their members separately to hold oath-taking ceremonies for the twelve items of the National Covenant within the National Spiritual Mobilization. Other schools, shops, and households will all be convened by their respective principals, shop owners, and parents to hold oath-taking ceremonies. The text of the Covenant and the oath are recorded below: "Covenant": 1. Not to violate the Three Principles of the People; 2. Not to violate government laws and regulations; 3. Not to violate the interests of the nation and the people; 4. Not to be a traitor or a submissive subject of the enemy country; 5. Not to participate in traitor organizations; 6. Not to be an officer or soldier of the enemy army or traitors; 7. Not to guide the enemy or traitors; 8. Not to gather information for the enemy or traitors; 9. Not to work for the enemy or traitors; 10. Not to use banknotes from enemy or traitor banks; 11. Not to buy enemy goods; 12. Not to sell food or any items to the enemy or traitors. "Oath": We all take our conscience, swear to abide by the National Covenant, absolutely support the leadership of President Chiang, do our best to serve the country, and if there is any breach of the oath, we are willing to accept the punishment of the government. Respectfully sworn.</p>
<p>Thrift Committee's Letter to Fellow Citizens: Regarding President Chiang's announcement of the implementation of National Spiritual Mobilization, the Thrift Movement Committee of this city issued a letter to fellow citizens of the entire city yesterday, stating: President Chiang, in order to invigorate the national spirit, personally drafted the Outline and Measures for National Spiritual Mobilization, and on the day of Sun Yat-sen's death, telegraphed the entire country to announce its implementation. This committee dares to earnestly address fellow citizens of the entire city once again on the point of correcting lives and practicing thrift. Our country's war of resistance against Japan has entered the second stage. Although the date of final victory is not far off, there are many things that require our greatest efforts. At a time when the flames of the enemy have not been extinguished and the mountains and rivers are broken, it is a time for the entire nation to lie on firewood and taste gall, endure hardship, and temper themselves. However, people in isolated islands, due to the influence of the adverse environment, are mostly accustomed to extravagant and decadent lives, which has a profound and significant impact on the future of the war of resistance. In the past year, through the loud appeals of enthusiastic people from all sectors, advocating thrift and disaster relief, although there has been good progress on the surface, it is still far from what we hope for in reality. If we look at the thrift practices of the aggressor countries, members of the royal family do not add new clothes, government officials do not ride in cars, police and students do not wear leather shoes, and all other aspects of life enjoyment are subject to strict restrictions. Even the lions and tigers in the zoo eat fish instead of meat. Although it is said that the enemy country's economy has shown signs of collapse, the spirit of hard work and endurance of its people is indeed worthy of our emulation. Now, at the time of National Spiritual Mobilization, this committee earnestly hopes that fellow citizens of the entire city will fulfill the following items: (1) Rectify daily life and stop all improper entertainment; (2) Prohibit extravagance, waste, and all meaningless squandering; (3) Purchase domestic goods as much as possible and limit the consumption of imported goods; (4) Reduce life enjoyment, strictly implement universal austerity, and contribute the proceeds of thrift to the government, thereby enriching the strength of the war of resistance and striving for final victory. Fellow citizens of the entire city, the bandits have not been eliminated, and the national disaster is serious. Why not rise up quickly and avoid being devoured by the tiger? May we encourage each other to strive together!</p>
<h3>Chinese Courts in the French Concession: Agreement Extended Indefinitely; Explicit Stipulation in Exchange of Notes Between Foreign Minister Luo and French Ambassador to China</h3>
<p>Special Court No. 1 Agreement Also Extended as Usual; The establishment of courts at all levels by the National Government of the Republic of China in the French Concession of Shanghai is based on an agreement signed by the Chinese and French governments in Nanjing on July 28, 1931. The agreement was effective from July 31 of that year to April 1, 1933. At the expiration date, both parties agreed to extend it for three years. The extension period was extended again after it expired. Recently, there have been rumors that the term of the extended extension will expire at the end of this month. A reporter from the Shanghai Guangshe Newspaper obtained reliable information from judicial circles yesterday that after the Chinese and French governments signed the agreement on July 28, 1933, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan of the National Government and French Ambassador to China Mr. Wei exchanged notes in March 1933 regarding the agreement, and there was no objection to the agreement, and it should be extended indefinitely. According to the note, the agreement is still extended indefinitely, and the rumors from outside are purely fabricated. As for Special Court No. 1, based on the precedents of repeated extensions on April 1, 1933, and April 1, 1936, it will of course be extended again for three years from April 1 this year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Price Controls: Scope Expanded</h3>
<p>Demonstrating Weak Purchasing Power; Life Is Extremely Painful; The Continental Daily News reports that in the first half of this month, the officially set price controls in Japan have been greatly expanded. The retail prices of liquor, sugar, alcohol, coffee, and other foods have all been limited to the high prices as of March 4, and no further increases are allowed. The prices of silk fabrics have been reduced by 20% to 30% and must not exceed the prices as of January 10 of this year. Orders have also been suddenly issued to reduce the prices of various leather goods by 20%. This movement to curb continued price increases in Japan and to reduce standard prices is the main task of the newly formed Central Price Policy Committee. The chairman of the committee is former Minister of Finance and Commerce and Industry Ikeda.</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Still Unwilling to Open the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily News on the 14th, the Japanese Navy spokesperson stated at a press conference yesterday that the blockade of the Yangtze River is related to "military needs." Once these "needs" cease to exist, navigation on the Yangtze River can be opened. When a foreign reporter asked when these "needs" might cease, the spokesperson replied that this period could not be predicted. However, among the so-called "needs," a distinction should be made between the "needs" of the army and the "needs" of the navy. As far as the navy is concerned, if the situation permits, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River may be opened in part for international navigation.</p>
<h3>Puppet Municipal Government: Indiscriminate Exactions</h3>
<p>Also Launches "Business Registration"; "Protection" Only Available After Paying Fees</p>
<p>The puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government," due to the unusually active guerrilla forces of the Chinese army in the suburbs, has recruited several hundred puppet police officers to strengthen security. However, the expenses for this are insufficient, so it has to find other ways to make up the shortfall. The puppet "Social Affairs Bureau" has established so-called "Provisional Rules for Business Registration," consisting of 34 articles, stipulating that all businesses must register with the puppet "Police Bureau." Those with capital of 1,000 yuan pay a fee of one yuan, those with up to 10,000 yuan pay two yuan, those with up to 100,000 yuan pay five yuan, and those with more than 100,000 yuan add five yuan for every 100,000 yuan. "Protection" is only available after registering and paying the fee. Therefore, all industries in the occupied areas are suffering oppression and resentment.</p>
<h3>Yanglinkou: Attack on Japanese Warship</h3>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Sets of Military Uniforms Unloaded and Distributed for Use by Various Units; A Japanese No. 3 transport ship, carrying over ten thousand sets of military uniforms, departed from Shanghai and sailed to Yanglinkou. Because the water was shallow, it could not sail further and was anchored there. The night before last (the 12th), it was suddenly attacked by the guerrilla force of Cai Jinqi, who killed six Japanese soldiers and disarmed the rest. The over ten thousand sets of military uniforms were unloaded and distributed for use by various units. By the time a large Japanese force arrived, the unit had already left.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rice Prices Gradually Stabilizing: Price Evaluation Committee Established Today; Suppressing Backdoor Deals, Investigating Speculative Manipulation, Vigorously Clearing Sources, Food Supply in Shanghai Not a Concern</h3>
<p>After the Soybean and Rice Industry and seven other groups decided to organize a Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee, the committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting today at 2:00 PM. A resolution will be made to evaluate prices based on the previously agreed price limit. The Rice Market Management Committee has earnestly enforced the price limit, suppressed backdoor deals, and thoroughly investigated speculative manipulation. Since yesterday, market prices have gradually stabilized, and speculators have gradually disappeared. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Committee Meeting to Evaluate Rice Prices: The Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee, jointly formed by the Soybean and Rice, Rice Store, Rice Milling, and Rice Grain Dealers Associations, as well as the Rice Transport Merchants United Benefit Association, Changshu Guild Hall, and Nanbang Guild Hall, was notified yesterday by Fu Qian’geng, the convener designated by the Soybean and Rice Industry, that the first committee meeting will be held at the Shanghai Commercial Company on Hankou Road at 2:00 PM today to announce its establishment. It was also resolved to evaluate Shanghai rice prices based on the previously agreed price limit, that is, first-grade white rice must not exceed 14 yuan. The rice prices of the middle grade shall be valued accordingly. Subsequently, all passenger lines and firms must comply with this evaluated price; however, the commission for buying and selling may be added separately, at 12 cents per picul.</p>
<p>Suppressing Backdoor Deals and Investigating Manipulation: The Soybean and Rice Market Management Committee has earnestly enforced the 14-yuan price limit and suppressed illegal backdoor transactions, thoroughly investigating hoarding and speculative manipulation. If any violations of the above circumstances are discovered, a report will be submitted to the association for sanctions. At the same time, the Rice Transport Merchants United Benefit Association has advised rice merchants to make every effort to clear sources, to take the overall situation into account, to maintain the food supply, and to not stop selling due to rising rice prices in the production area. It is reported that various firms and merchants have agreed to cooperate with each other to maintain the Shanghai food supply and stabilize market prices.</p>
<p>Market Rice Prices Gradually Stabilizing: Since yesterday, due to the earnest enforcement of the price limit by various rice industry groups, speculators have gradually disappeared. Hoarders, fearing being discovered and punished, have sold part of their stocks at the limited price. As a result, market prices have gradually stabilized and backdoor deals have gradually decreased. As for the amount of goods arriving recently, it has increased compared to last week, at approximately 5,000 to 6,000 bags per day. It is estimated that the current stock in Shanghai is approximately 600,000 bags, which is sufficient for three months. Therefore, there is temporarily no concern about a shortage of the overall food supply. Even when the new crop is not yet available, the situation will not be too serious.</p>
<h3>Public Celebration Date Set for Ma Xiangbo's Centenary Birthday</h3>
<p>Scheduled for April 6 at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association; Since the fellow countrymen of Zhen, Dan, Jin, Li, and Yang counties began preparing for a public celebration of Mr. Ma Xiangbo's centenary birthday, participants from all sides have been very enthusiastic. Including He Dekui and hundreds of others, the association has now decided to hold the birthday celebration ceremony at the Ningbo Fellow Countrymen Association on April 6.</p>
<h3>Puppet "Ministry of Communications" Attempts to Print Puppet "Stamps" Fails</h3>
<p>After the puppet "Reformed Government," under Japanese prompting, declared its "establishment" in Nanjing on March 28 of last year, all the clowns who donned official hats were scheming and plotting against each other, exhausting their ability to extort in order to fill their own pockets, causing the people's burden to increase and their suffering to be unbearable. Recently, the puppet "Ministry of Communications," in order to attempt to open up a path to wealth, planned to print puppet "stamps" itself. After several discussions, because the "puppet government" is a puppet organization and is not recognized by various countries, the Universal Postal Union has decided not to agree to the issuance of puppet "stamps." It is now understood that the puppet "Ministry of Communications" knows it cannot overcome the difficulties, and the plan to issue puppet "stamps" cannot be realized after all.</p>
<h3>The Serious State of the Shanghai Battlefield: "Pacification Troops" Retreat from West Shanghai, Chinese Forces Begin Encirclement in South Pudong</h3>
<p>A mainland news report states that yesterday (the 13th), according to Chinese and Japanese sources, fierce fighting has been occurring in the Shanghai area for the past seven days, involving a considerable number of troops. This confirms earlier reports that guerrilla forces were stepping up their activities in most parts of Shanghai. The area closest to the city where fighting has taken place is Hongqiao. Regular Chinese troops, displaying strength and dispersed tactics, attacked Japanese forces stationed in the area from midnight until dawn yesterday, then withdrew in good order, without any losses.</p>
<p>Despite the Japanese military spokesman telling reporters last night that he had no knowledge of the fighting in Hongqiao and that he believed no fighting had occurred, inquiries among Hongqiao residents revealed that the sound of gunfire, which did not cease from midnight until 7:00 AM, was certainly not target practice. Yesterday afternoon, a Hongqiao resident told a reporter that both sides must have used machine guns, and he believed that hand grenades had also been used during the attack. This indicates that the two armies must have been very close to each other. According to Chinese sources, the attack was particularly focused on striking the "Great Way Pacification Army" which was close to Shanghai. This is a team of Han traitors sent from Nanjing to replace the Japanese garrison that was suffering from fatigue. Last night, a Japanese military spokesman reported on the fighting that had occurred in the past week, which further confirmed recent Chinese reports of active guerrilla forces in the Shanghai area. Although the detailed reports of casualties from the Chinese and Japanese sides differed, the large number of troops involved indicated that the fighting was undoubtedly serious. According to a Japanese military spokesman last night, Japanese forces and 1,000 Chinese irregular troops were engaged in a full day of intense fighting.</p>
<p>Fighting began on Friday when Japanese forces occupied Nanhui in Pudong. This was because 200 guerrillas active in the northeast of Nanhui began to move towards Nanhui at dawn on Friday. At that time, there were also 300 guerrillas in Nanhui. When the Japanese army lined up to attack, another 500 guerrillas set out from Datuan, about six kilometers south of Nanhui, to attack. After the Japanese army engaged them, they attacked Nanhui again and occupied it at 4:00 PM. The spokesman exaggerated the Japanese losses as one dead and three wounded. On Saturday morning, Japanese forces fought with a Chinese army team of about 200 people at Tanzhiqiao, 20 kilometers southeast of Nanhui. The spokesman said that there were no Japanese casualties. At 9:00 AM on Tuesday, Japanese forces clashed with about 300 guerrillas 10 kilometers south of Fengxian. There was also fighting near Qingpu Baihe Port (transliteration) west of Shanghai on Friday. Fighting also broke out on Chongming Island on the same day. The spokesman continued,</p>
<p>From January 21 to February 20, Japanese troops stationed in the Suzhou area fought with Chinese troops and guerrillas a total of 61 times. The Japanese army had 11 dead and 19 wounded. In addition, about 700 Chinese guerrillas active in Jurong and Danyang have been fighting with the Japanese army since the 6th of this month, and the fighting is still ongoing. These Chinese troops belong to the New Fourth Route Army and carry mortars and other military equipment.</p>
<p>According to Xiandai News Agency, because gunshots have been heard frequently in the West Shanghai area recently, the Japanese army is extremely fearful and has sent a large number of soldiers to reinforce the defenses. They are stationed in the Singapore Road Gonda Cotton Mill, the Robertson Road Xihe Cotton Mill, and the Toyota Cotton Mill. In addition to setting up barbed wire around them, they are also busy building watchtowers and defensive sandbag bunkers. Their state of anxiety is increasingly symbolic of being mired in a quagmire and unable to extricate themselves.</p>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that the Hongqiao area, where guerrillas were active the night before last (the 12th), has now returned to peace and tranquility. The "Pacification Army" was transferred out of the area yesterday, and was replaced by Japanese forces and the "Great Way Police" to garrison the area.</p>
<p>According to people from South Pudong, since the weather has cleared up, the fighting in the Fengxian-Songjiang area has expanded. The Japanese army has been reinforcing from Minhang and Songjiang in North Pudong across the river, attempting to connect Nanqiao, Zhuangxing, Shengzimiao, Tinglin, Hougang, and Songyin, which stretch 40 miles from east to west, into a line, maintaining a stronghold 20 miles deep from the Huangpu River, and then trying to advance to the southeast. Guerrillas and regular troops are cooperating here, launching large-scale counterattacks for days. Artillery fire fills the sky as they advance valiantly through a rain of bullets, having cut the Japanese army into three sections, tightly surrounding them. Nanqiao has been recovered, the retreat of the Japanese army in Tinglin has been cut off, and their situation is dangerous. The Japanese army in Hougang has all retreated back to Songyin, so Hougang has returned to Chinese hands. The extent of damage on both sides is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Japanese Tax Police Arrest Landing Passengers: A Young Passenger on the "Moffat" is Deemed an "Anti-Japanese Element"</h3>
<p>The German shipping company Reiss &amp; Co.'s "Moffat" vessel arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo at about 1:00 PM on the 10th and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. As a young male passenger, dressed in a Western suit and wearing a large hat, one wearing a yellow wool coat, a cabin passenger from Dinghai Shenjiamen, and the other wearing a herringbone coat, named Qiu Ahua, disembarked, they were successively stopped by the Japanese tax police of the Jianghai Customs, who arbitrarily searched them. An envelope from the Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Association was found in the yellow-coated passenger's pocket, and a list of books, all anti-Japanese books, was found on Qiu's person, causing the Japanese police to become hostile and deeming him an "anti-Japanese element", and arresting him. The passenger from Dinghai was released on bail by a senior official of the Jianghai Customs, while Qiu Ahua was sent to the Japanese military headquarters. It is reported that Qiu is 25 years old, from Hengxi in South Yin County, and had studied in Japan for two months. He returned to China due to the outbreak of the war of resistance. He was illegally arrested on this trip from Ningbo to Shanghai. His life and safety are a matter of great concern.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Decides to Establish Economic Hubs in Various Provinces: Plans to Connect Factories Relocated to Sichuan, Promote Agriculture, and Establish Training Courses</h3>
<p>Weng Wenhao, the Minister of Economic Affairs, has many plans for economic construction in the rear. Recently, in addition to gradually implementing the various implementation measures of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Extraordinary Periods promulgated last year, he has also decided to establish economic hubs to increase production, and has formulated various implementation measures. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Regarding ways to connect factories relocated to Sichuan, the Ministry believes that to implement economic management, supply and demand must be matched to speak of control. At present, unified methods have been planned for the management of tungsten, antimony, and tin mines. Since the implementation, it has been beneficial to national resources and the interests of investing merchants. In addition, although the more than 300 factories relocated to Sichuan have different businesses, their raw material supply, production, and sales have all been connected. The government encourages domestic products, society promotes them, transportation is assisted as much as possible, and economic barriers can be solidified. Therefore, in addition to necessities, the rear provinces have no difficulty in supply and demand for domestic products.</p>
<p>Regarding developing the economy and establishing economic hubs, the Ministry, to further develop production, has recently planned to increase raw materials and equipment for various mines and factories, and has formulated measures to encourage the production of liquid fuels. To support the rise of small industries in the interior, it is working on the establishment of ten economic hubs, which will be geographically distributed in Hunan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai, Kangding, and other provinces, to unify the pace and enable various small industries to assist their development based on their location and environment.</p>
<p>Regarding promoting agriculture and establishing training courses, the Ministry has more than 70,000 cooperatives and mutual aid societies in the rear provinces, more than 80 treasuries have been established, and more than 120 warehouses have been built. To increase production and develop agriculture in the rear, it has been decided to pay attention to cultivating agricultural talents. It is preparing to open a training course for agricultural extension workers in Chongqing, with each training session scheduled to last for half a year. After consulting with Jinling University on the training steps, the university will be responsible for the training.</p>

<h3>Nephew Accuses Maternal Uncle: Liu Yingcen Attempts to Embezzle Property, Two Nephews Sue, Court Orders Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Liu Yingcen, a native of Suzhou and the principal of Peichu Elementary School on Haifang Road, had an older sister who married Shen Jinwen, a native of Yangzhou who worked in banking. They had two sons, the elder named Jiezhi and the younger named Yizhi. Jinwen died of illness in 1914. Ms. Liu remained a widow to raise her sons, and she also died of illness in the winter of 1922. At that time, Jiezhi and his brother were still young, so their maternal uncle, Liu Yingcen, handled the funeral arrangements for them and sorted out and kept safe the clothing and belongings left by their sister. He told his two nephews that he would hand them over when they grew up and gave them a booklet recording the types and amounts of the inherited property to show his impartiality. After the August 13th Incident, Jiezhi and Yizhi lost their jobs one after another. For more than a year, their livelihood became increasingly difficult. Recently, they recalled what their uncle had said in their childhood and learned that Liu was now the principal of a school and was in a good situation. So they brought the booklet written by Liu Xiang's relative to Shanghai from their hometown to claim the inheritance of their parents, worth more than a thousand gold. Unexpectedly, Liu did not consider the affection, and gave them a cold shoulder. Regarding the property he had kept safe, he initially evaded the issue, and then, realizing that his nephews had solid evidence, it was very difficult for him to embezzle it. He had to admit it, but said that all the property had been used up by him, and it was difficult to return it. However, he made no indication of how to compensate them. Therefore, the two Shens hired a lawyer from Qianyuan to sue their maternal uncle Liu Yingcen for embezzlement of property in the First Special District Court, requesting punishment in accordance with Article 335, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and ordering him to return the original property or compensate for the price. Yesterday, under the trial of Judge Dai, considering that the plaintiff and defendant were nephews and uncles, it was not appropriate to harm their relationship, so he advised them to resolve the matter peacefully. Both parties were moved by the advice, and the court ordered them to withdraw and mediate themselves, and adjourned the case for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Bans Firecrackers</h3>
<p>At a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Defense Committee on the 6th of this month, it was decided to recommend to the Council that from May 1st of this year until further notice, the storage, possession, sale, or manufacture of firecrackers be prohibited in the concession. In the future, if the situation permits the lifting of the ban, the Council will order firecracker businesses to apply for licenses. This proposal has been approved by the Council's Board of Directors.</p>
<h3>Man Commits Suicide Due to Unemployment</h3>
<p>Xu Taisheng, a young man living at No. 110, Lane 411, Dagu Road in the Public Concession, was 27 years old. Recently, due to financial difficulties and poverty, unable to support himself, he suddenly had a dark thought at 8:58 last night and secretly swallowed raw opium and poisonous liquid to commit suicide. His family members noticed and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that he had been poisoned too deeply, and his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Case of New Fourth Army Pay Being Robbed: Witnesses Jia Genbao and Others Testify; The Course of Events of Commander Liang's Murder; Liang Ziqiu's Plea for Amnesty is "Cut Down by the Roots"</h3>
<p>Liang Zuocheng, the commander of the New Fourth Army and a native of Guangdong, was traveling through Qiaoxiang Village in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, in December of the previous year with three guards, his sixteen-year-old son, and 327,000 yuan in pay. They were stopped by dozens of local bandits armed with weapons. As a result, Commander Liang, his son, and five guards were killed, and the pay was robbed and spent. Later, the army commander Ye Ting sent troops to arrest the bandit leaders Da Yuanlin, and his accomplices Chen Youfa, Qiao Detai, Qiao Yikun, Zhang Bingquan, and five other bandits. They were interrogated by Commander Ye and found to be true, and were all executed by shooting. Last year, Chinese Detective Shang Wu of the Huizhong Police Station received a report from informant Gao Binghui and arrested accomplices in the case at Beishan West Road, Shandong Road, and other places: Dai Hongfu (also known as Jigeng), Chen Heshang (i.e., the son of Chen Youfa, who had already been executed), Chen Bosheng, Qiao Changjin, Chen Qiaosheng and six other people. They were sent to the First Special District Court. After investigation by the police station, Chen Qiaosheng was found to be irrelevant and was released on bail. The four people, Dai Hongchang and others, were questioned several times and overturned and denied their previous confessions to the police station that they had obtained 150 yuan after the incident. They were ordered to be returned to prison pending review and decision by the Supreme Court's branch. Yesterday, the police station summoned Jia Baogen, Zhang Heshang, and Shen Zhigao, all natives of Jurong who worked as waiters in a bathhouse on Jiujiang Road. When Commander Liang was murdered by bandits in Qiaoxiang Village, Jurong County, Yi Zhi and others were involved. When the four defendants, Dai Hongfu and others, were escorted to the Third Criminal Court, lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station said that informant Gao Binghui had returned to his hometown last winter, fell ill and died. Now there are three witnesses, Jia Dougen and others, to testify in court, please question them. The court warned the parties that the case was of great importance, and they should not testify casually, but must be based on the facts. They were ordered to make a declaration, and Jia Baogen returned to his hometown to avoid the war after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. His home was only two miles away from Qiaoxiang Village. He knew that Commander Liang was killed between November 16 of the previous year in the lunar calendar. At that time, Commander Liang and his son and soldiers, a total of five people, passed through the area and were seen by a large number of bandits, i.e., the defendants, carrying a bag of flour containing hundreds of thousands of banknotes. They pointed out that they were criminals. Commander Liang stated that he was a formal military officer and that the banknotes were for the payment of troops 50 miles away in Maoshan. Moreover, Commander Liang and his guards were all wearing military uniforms. They ignored it and said that no matter who the officer was, he could not pass with such a large amount of money. They tied up Commander Liang, his son, and two soldiers. Commander Liang was willing to give all the banknotes as a reward to them, and release him and the soldiers to go to Maoshan and then come back to pick up his son. They refused. So at 4:00 PM that afternoon, they brought Commander Liang and his group to the mud tomb site in the back garden near the village. The defendant Dai Hongfu took out a box cannon and handed it to the defendant Qiao Changjin, who first killed Commander Liang and the three guards, and then killed Liang's sixteen-year-old son. I witnessed it all, and the defendants Chen Heshang and Chen Bosheng were also there with guns and other weapons, etc. Witness Zhang Heshang testified that he returned to his hometown in September of the previous year due to the war. That afternoon, he learned that Commander Liang and others had been murdered by bandits, i.e., the defendants. I went to the scene to see that Commander Liang and three soldiers had been killed with box cannons. However, Liang's son was asking if they could spare his life. Unexpectedly, Da Yuanlin (he was the village chief), the leader who had been arrested and executed, said that to cut the grass and eliminate the roots, he would also kill him, otherwise Qiaoxiang Village would not be safe. The defendant Qiao Changjin killed him, etc. According to Shen Zhigao's testimony, he was in his home in Shen Tie Village, three miles away from Qiaoxiang Village. On that day, in the afternoon, he also saw Commander Liang and others at the scene of the murder, holding a large piece of paper written by Yi Shu, stating that he was a formal military officer from Guangdong, who had made meritorious service in the battle in Zhabei, Shanghai, etc. The large amount of banknotes was to be sent to Maoshan to pay the soldiers under his command. Unexpectedly, the leader Da Yuanlin refused and tore up the paper. The defendant Dai Hongfu gave the box cannon to the defendant Qiao Changjin, who killed Commander Liang and others. The defendants Chen Heshang and Chen Bosheng were also at the scene, etc. When questioned, the defendants all firmly denied it. Judge Huang Risheng ruled that they should be returned to prison and reconsidered at a later date.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Over Jewelry Merchant's Inheritance</h3>
<p>Investigation to be Conducted at the Bank, Hearing Rescheduled for the 20th. Zhang Ou, the elderly mother of the late wealthy jewelry merchant Zhang Bingweng of Shanghai, is 76 years old and lives in the Continental Fang on Luban Road. Recently, she entrusted lawyers Ge Zhitan and Sun Deji to file a lawsuit in the Second Branch of the Shanghai Special District Court, accusing her son Bingxin's concubines, Zhang Qin and Zhang Dai, along with his adopted son Zhang Haoqiu and real estate tycoon Huang Ruisheng, of colluding to steal jewelry, jade articles, emeralds, and real estate stock certificates in the Salt Industry Bank safe deposit box, all sealed in suitcases, and accused Huang of receiving stolen goods and abandoning his elders, etc. After repeated hearings by Magistrate Miao Qingbang, Huang Ruisheng received a court summons, felt stimulated, and fell ill, and passed away on the 1st of this month. The defendants Qin, Dai, and Zhang Haoqiu, etc., separately hired lawyers to defend them, and were ordered to reschedule the hearing for further investigation. Details have been recorded in this newspaper several times. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao continued to hear the case in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff Zhang Ou was represented by lawyers Ge and Sun due to her old age and illness, and the defendants also arrived with their lawyers. After the court briefly questioned the defendants, it summoned witnesses Kong Runlin, Zhu Xianghe, Huang Songtao, Liu Qianzhen, Feng Hanchu, and Liu Chenggui to be questioned one by one. According to Kong, Zhang Bingxin was my mentor. After Zhang's death, I copied and recorded all his inherited jewelry and the assets in the safe deposit box into five copies. Later, Tu Zhengfu wrote a seal and sealed the suitcase. I was not present when the box was opened for analysis later. The remaining witnesses, Zhu Xianghe and others, only proved the valuation. At this point in the hearing, the court considered it necessary to investigate at the bank and ordered that the hearing be rescheduled to the 20th.</p>
<h3>Selling a Truck, Preparing to Get Married, Unexpectedly Shot Dead</h3>
<p>Shan Jinshun (age 41), a native of Tongzhou, lived at No. 422, Seymour Road. Recently, because he wanted to marry a certain woman, he had no money to pay the various expenses. Therefore, he entrusted his fellow villager Zhou Miao, the driver, to drive his own No. 3565 truck, valued at 1,500 yuan, to Hongkou on the 11th to sell it to someone. Unexpectedly, the price was not suitable and the deal did not go through. Previously, he had discussed it with his younger brothers Shan Jinshan and Shan Jinfu. That night, his two younger brothers invited their fellow villager Xu Susheng from No. 14, Qingyuli, Doule An Road, to gather and discuss the matter. Xu then contacted someone to sell it. Shan Jinshun and the driver Zhou Miao went to dinner in the truck. Shan drank too much alcohol and often did not return at night. The next morning, he was shot dead with a handgun at the entrance of No. 14, Lane 309, Wuchang Road. The murderer could not be found. The other day, Liu Zhongcheng, a Chinese detective from the Yangshupu Police Station, learned of the sale of the car and arrested Zhou Miaokai, Xu Liansheng, Shan Jinshan, Shan Yufu and four other people one after another and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, explained the course of events and requested detention for further investigation. Judge Huang questioned the defendants and ordered them to be returned to prison for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Women Take Poison, One Dies</h3>
<p>Two women took poison in Room 224 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Edward Road on the night before last. One was named Zhu Xiuzhen and the other was surnamed Chuan, whose name was unknown. They were both discovered by a hotel waiter and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that although Zhu Xiuzhen was rescued, she was too deeply poisoned and could not be revived. She died in the hospital at 7:58 yesterday afternoon. Her body will be sent to the Coroner's Office for examination. According to the deceased's family, they have been found. The reason for the double suicide is still under investigation. The condition of the woman surnamed Chuan has improved slightly, but the danger has not passed.</p>
<h3>Younger Brother Steals Property and Cuts His Older Sister, Further Investigation Pending</h3>
<p>Mao Yongkang, a native of Ningbo living at No. 175, Lane 195, Lanweiai Road in the French Concession, made a living selling chickens and ducks. His wife, Lu, was 31 years old, a native of Jiashan. She had a younger brother, Lu Wenzhong, also known as Ronghua, 22 years old, who usually ate and lived at Mao's house and did nothing. On November 13 of last year, while his older sister Lu was out, Lu Wenzhong sneaked into the room and stole a pair of gold bracelets, a gold lock, and 150 yuan in cash, all belonging to his older sister. He escaped and did not return. When Lu discovered it, there was no way to recover it. Until 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, Lu Wenzhong suddenly came back. His older sister, Lu, asked where the gold jewelry and cash were. He claimed that he had not spent it. He had found a job at Ruikai Foreign Firm at No. 130, Renji Road, and had given 200 yuan as a deposit. The remaining money and jewelry were all in the firm. He still stayed at Mao's house that night. Unexpectedly, at 8:00 AM on the 4th, as soon as Mao Lu got up to go to the toilet, Lu Wenzhong suddenly rushed into the room with a kitchen knife and, without asking why, slashed his older sister Lu on the head. She was slashed on the back of her hand because she reached out to block it. She shouted loudly and someone twisted Lu and arrested him, and he was sent to the police station for interrogation and detention at the Second Special District Court. It has been filed for investigation and further interrogation. Yesterday, President Liao rescheduled the case for one week for further investigation and prosecution. The court approved it. Without questioning him, he approved that it be rescheduled for seven days and re-interrogated. The defendant was returned to prison.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Concert</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra's 22nd Symphony Concert of the season will be held at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:15 PM on the 19th of this month (Sunday). The program includes four items. Ticket prices remain the same.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Chinese Detective Arrested for Drug Trafficking a Second Time After Release from Prison</h3>
<p>Zhang Guilin, a native of Tianjin, 40 years old, lived at No. 11, Rixinli, Jinshenfu Road. He was formerly Chinese Detective No. 80 of the French Concession Police Station. He was dismissed for committing a crime. Later, he sold morphine outside and was discovered by Detective Sui Wenzhi a year ago, and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. He was sentenced to three and a half years in prison and was serving his sentence. Because the prison released prisoners, he was released on parole. Unexpectedly, Zhang still engaged in his old business. He is now secretly selling morphine at the home of a woman from Jiangyin, Li Lou (30 years old), in the pavilion room at No. 1 in the same lane. She was hired to be an associate. Recently, Sui Wenzhi, a detective from the French Concession Police Station, found out about it and rushed there the other day, arresting Zhang and Li together and confiscating 35 packets of morphine and the money earned. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the Second Special District Court and a request was made to detain him and to prosecute the case after further investigation. President Liao presided over a hearing in the First Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Refugee Population Statistics</h3>

<h3>Lu Xihou and His Wife Sue the Shanghai Municipal Council for Violating Land Regulations, Forcibly Relocating Them, and Insulting Them: The Plaintiff Wins After Two Years of Litigation</h3>
<p>Lu Xihou and his wife sued the Shanghai Consular Court, accusing the Shanghai Municipal Council of forcibly relocating them and insulting them. A judgment has now been announced and the plaintiffs, Mr. and Mrs. Lu, have won. The defendant will compensate Lu Xihou for nominal losses, totaling one yuan in national currency, and will bear the litigation and lawyer's fees, and compensate Lu's wife for damages suffered, totaling 300 yuan in national currency. The case was heard by US Consul General Gauss, British Consul General Phillips, and Japanese Consul General Miura. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Roger, and the defendant was represented by the Gao Shi Law Firm. After Commissioner Lang took the testimony of both parties on November 30 and December 1 last year, the judgment was announced today. The case arose in 1937, when the Municipal Council, in order to widen the road, acquired the property where the plaintiffs lived (the land number was 10027) and ordered them to move out before June 30 of that year. On July 1, the Municipal Council Police Station was ordered to carry out the eviction and demolish the house to build the road. Lu's wife came out to obstruct it and was detained in the Chengdu Road Police Station for about an hour before being released. When the Consular Court ruled on the case, it stated that Lu Xihou was a Chinese citizen, and only Chinese courts had jurisdiction over forced relocation. However, the Municipal Council did not obtain an order from the competent court when implementing it, which was inconsistent with the provisions of the land regulations. Moreover, Lu's wife was expelled from the house for no reason and was insulted at the time, so it ordered that the plaintiff be compensated for losses.</p>
<h3>Southwestern Journey Jottings (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Shell Factory</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, the southwestern provinces have become our base for resistance and national reconstruction, and the nation's hub. There have been many accounts of various places in the Southwest scattered in newspapers and magazines, but in the current situation, everything is changing day by day. Therefore, it is truly difficult to write a reliable record that can help travelers as a reference. Yesterday, a friend working for a certain travel agency returned to Shanghai after investigating various places in the Southwest. He reported on his journey and all the experiences one should have when going to the Southwest now. Not only is it the latest report and relatively close to the facts, but he also spoke very clearly about the common sense one should know based on his experience. I think this kind of report is much better than ordinary works that only record itineraries and en route conditions. Moreover, this kind of practical experience is what most people need to know. The following is my friend's report: I departed from Hong Kong on September 21st of last year, first arriving at Wuzhou. Transportation between Hong Kong and Wuzhou is convenient by ship. (Since the fall of Guangdong, this route has been suspended, but when the overall situation recovers in the future, this line will still be the main traffic artery from Hong Kong to Guangxi.) The ship's facilities were very good, and the food was also palatable. The city streets of Wuzhou were quite well-organized. At that time, because there were frequent air raid alerts, the market during the day was not as lively as it was at night. The people of Guangxi province all wore short clothes and cloth shoes, and they were all barefoot, even when entertaining guests. This kind of honest and frugal folk custom is truly admirable. Accommodation and food in Wuzhou are manageable, but cleanliness and hygiene have not yet become widespread. The Wuzhou bus station is in Rongxu, a town across the river from Wuzhou. The round trip river crossing uses electric boats, which takes a little more than an hour, which is quite convenient.</p>
<p>On the 25th, at dawn, I departed from Wuzhou for Liuzhou. Upon arriving in Rongxu, I bought a ticket and boarded the bus. All the seats were numbered, so passengers could sit in their assigned seats. Being able to buy a ticket guarantees you a seat, which is a very good system. The road surface on this section was very flat, and that evening, I arrived in Yulin, a stopover between Wuzhou and Liuzhou where passengers must disembark and stay in a hotel. However, the station is not responsible for passengers' luggage after they disembark; you must manage it yourself. Furthermore, after disembarking, you must go to the station to register your number for the next day's bus. These procedures are quite inconvenient for single travelers, so single travelers should be sure to bring as little luggage as possible. The next morning, the bus departed at 7:00 AM. We had lunch in Rong County midway, and arrived in Liuzhou at 6:00 PM. The Liuzhou authorities were very strict about inspecting luggage. Several students traveling with me had brought a deck of playing cards to pass the time on the journey. Unexpectedly, after they were discovered during inspection, they were deemed gambling tools. Although they explained, it was ultimately ineffective, and they were fined twenty yuan. Therefore, travelers entering Guangxi must not bring such entertainment items to avoid being fined.</p>
<p>Liuzhou is divided into north and south banks. All the marketplaces are on the north bank, and the city of Liuzhou is also located on the north bank. However, the bus station is located on the south bank. For the convenience of travelers, although hotels and restaurants are also located near the station, they are not as lively as those on the north bank. As for the overall situation of the market, it is not as prosperous as Wuzhou.</p>
<p>The houses in both Wuzhou and Liuzhou are very special. All the walls have iron hooks nailed into them. When I first saw them, I was very puzzled. Later, after inquiring with the locals, I learned that Wuzhou and Liuzhou often experience major floods. When the flood arrives, the houses are submerged in water, and residents enter and exit entirely by boat, entering and exiting through the windows. These iron hooks are prepared for relying on boats and climbing out during floods.</p>
<p>It was not easy to buy bus tickets from Liuzhou to Guiyang. I originally wanted to depart on the 28th, but I ended up being delayed until October 1st before I bought a ticket and departed from Liuzhou.</p>
<p>The highway north from Liuzhou belongs to the Southwest Highway Administration. The first meal stop was Yishan, where the travelers had a good meal. Zhejiang University is located here, and it is also famous because Mr. Jiang Baili died of illness here. The Yishan Special Canteen is run by the China Travel Service. The vegetables are cooked very deliciously. I heard that chickens are very cheap here, but pork is not plentiful. After the meal, the bus departed, and that evening, we arrived at Hechi—the first overnight stop. Although Hechi is also a county, it only has one straight street and doesn't even have a county seat. It's not even as lively as a town in the Jiangnan region! This street is called Fengyi Street and is made of earth. The Hechi Hostel established by the China Travel Service is located on this street, no more than half a li from the bus station. The palm-mat beds it provides are said to be the only comfortable beds of their kind in the interior. What I especially can't forget is that the hostel also has bathing facilities. A bath only costs twenty cents, but it greatly reduced the fatigue from the journey.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 2nd, we left Hechi. We had lunch midway at Liuzhai. After the meal, we continued on our way and could reach Dushan in the evening. The section of highway from Liuzhai to Dushan can be said to be the worst section of the Southwest Highway, and it was extremely bumpy along the way. Dushan is the second overnight stop between Liuzhou and Guiyang. There are no good hotels locally. Fortunately, the China Travel Service has set up more than a dozen improved berths in the Xie'an Hotel, so we could barely stay there. Unfortunately, there were too few berths and not enough to meet the needs of the travelers.</p>
<p>The next day, we departed from Dushan and first arrived at Machangping. This place is a meeting and meal stop for the eastern and southern routes of the Southwest Highway. The canteen specially run by the local Southeast Inn for the travel agency can be considered to have the best food on the entire route. I had a satisfying lunch here. That afternoon, at 5:00 PM, we reached Guiyang.</p>
<p>Guiyang is the capital of Guizhou province and is now considered a hub for passenger and freight transport and a center of transportation. Therefore, the general headquarters of the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration is also located here. Guizhou has always been known for its poverty, but since the outbreak of war, more and more merchants from various places have come to Guizhou, so the market is much better than before. The facilities in the local hotels are all very basic. The best environment and facilities are in the Guiyang Hostel, commissioned by the provincial government to be run by the travel agency next to the provincial library on Cotton Alley Street in the city. The only drawback is that there are not many rooms, and guests often have to go without.</p>
<p>On October 12th, I departed from Guiyang, first heading to Chongqing. On the first day, we had lunch at Wujiangdu. The current of the Wujiang River is very rapid. Highway buses also need to cross the river by boat. When we crossed the river, because it was autumn, the water was still calm, and there was no danger. I heard that when spring arrives, the water becomes extremely turbulent, and the danger of crossing the river is very great. We stayed overnight in Tongzi in the evening. Although Tongzi is a small place, it has electric lights because it is the hometown of Mr. Zhou Xicheng. The travel agency also runs a hostel here, which is very clean and well-arranged, and it also prepares a type of Chinese-style Western food, which is very flavorful.</p>
<p>We departed early the next morning, and soon entered Sichuan province. We had lunch at Songkan at noon. After the meal, we boarded the bus again, and that night, we stayed in Qijiang. This place in Qijiang is extremely simple. After searching for a long time, we couldn't find a good hotel. Later, we stopped at a relatively large hotel. The beds there were made of bamboo planks, covered with a layer of straw mat, and there were no pillows. A cotton quilt was both narrow and short, and a woolen blanket was both torn and dirty. Before I could even close my eyes, mosquitoes and bedbugs came to attack me one after another. For people who are tired after a long journey, how painful it is to not be able to get a good night's sleep! In this hopeless environment, I came up with a passive way to resist. I bought several large sheets of tung oil paper to spread underneath to ward off bedbugs, and used a large bed sheet to cover myself from head to toe to control mosquitoes. Surprisingly, I slept soundly through the night and was not attacked. From this experience, it can be seen that when traveling to the interior these days, a large bed sheet and two sheets of tung oil paper are indispensable companions!</p>

<h3>Steamship Company Manager Accused of Fraud</h3>
<p>Ruan Wende, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 1, Bulinli, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, French Concession, 32 years old, recently retained a lawyer as his agent and filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court against Zhang Shuchun and Lin Changxiang for fraud and obtaining property. He requested an investigation and also filed a related civil suit. According to the statement, the plaintiff was introduced by the defendants and Qian Hongting in November of last year to work as a compradore on the Daxiship, operated by the Jiangyun Steamship Company managed by the defendants. It was stipulated that the monthly salary would be 80 yuan, and he was instructed to pay a security deposit of 300 yuan, which was received by the defendants and a receipt was issued. Unexpectedly, when the ship arrived in Shanghai on December 16, the plaintiff led two colleagues, intending to board the ship to work. To his surprise, the defendants suddenly refused and instead commissioned Qian Hongting to disembark. The plaintiff negotiated with them, and they agreed that he could board the ship to work when the next ship arrived. However, the Daxiship returned to Shanghai from the port on the 26th of the same month and was immediately disbanded. The plaintiff then demanded the return of the security deposit, but the defendants repeatedly evaded the issue and showed no sincerity in returning the money. Only then did he realize that he had been deceived. He requested the court to investigate and punish the defendants in accordance with Article 339 of the Criminal Law and to recover the security deposit of 300 yuan that he had paid. The court accepted the case. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Liquan opened a hearing and summoned the defendants. The plaintiff arrived with his lawyer and stated the previous situation. The defendants also arrived with their defense lawyers, Wan Weijian and Xu Jianjie. They stated that the ship had indeed sailed and that a receipt had been issued for the money received. Furthermore, when the ship was sailing, the plaintiff sent Yu Wenxing to work on board. They argued that the case was purely civil in nature and requested a clear investigation. The court examined the arguments and, finding that the facts were clear, ordered a debate and then announced the conclusion of the hearing, scheduling the judgment for the 17th.</p>

The Chinese text stated: Tang Yuqing is sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment for the crime of attempted murder. The pistol and bullets are to be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Specializing in Stealing from Prostitutes, Sentenced to Two Years and Eight Months</h3>
<p>The rogue Lin Genbao does not engage in honest work and makes a living by cheating women out of their property. Recently, he repeatedly hired prostitutes, intoxicated them with alcohol, and stole the jewelry they wore and the money in their wallets. The victims included Sister Chen of Shunfeng and Zhao Huifang of Yang Guifei. He was arrested by Detective Wang Shanqing of the Lao Zha Police Station and sent to the First Special Court. Attorney Ru Bao-yi of the police station prosecuted him according to law. The interrogation has been completed. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide announced the judgment in the First Criminal Court, sentencing Lin Genbao to two years and eight months of imprisonment to punish evil and serve as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi and Others Give Farewell Banquet for Overseas Chinese Inspection Group</h3>

<p>Chu Minyi and Xie Zhongfu hosted a farewell banquet yesterday for the Siamese Overseas Chinese Inspection Group. Six overseas Chinese, including Wu Jijiu, attended, along with Lin Kanghou and others as guests of honor. The group expressed satisfaction with the Shanghai National Goods Factory Union's arrangement for General Manager Ma Xishen to accompany them on visits to various member factories and expressed their gratitude. They stated that overseas Chinese compatriots love their motherland and that after reporting on the visit to Siam, the compatriots would be willing to purchase goods produced by various national goods factories in the future, and sales would inevitably increase.</p>
<h3>Incidents of Robbery</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 PM yesterday evening, a residence with the surname of a certain family at No. 4, Lane 509, Fujian Road (i.e., Shilu), was suddenly broken into by five robbers while the men and women in the house were sitting at the table for dinner. Two robbers carried firearms and ordered everyone to remain silent. They ransacked the place and searched everywhere, stealing a total of more than two thousand yuan. The victims provided a detailed list of the stolen items and reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>At around 10:00 PM last night, a certain watch store at No. 519 Zhejiang Road was about to close when three robbers from Fujian suddenly broke in to rob it. Only one of the robbers was carrying a firearm. However, at that time, an apprentice of the store was lingering outside and witnessed the group entering. Seeing their suspicious behavior, he went to the nearby police post at No. 441 to report the incident and shouted for help to catch the robbers. The robbers heard this and panicked. They did not have time to rob anything and turned around to flee. However, the police officer at post No. 441 had already arrived and grabbed the robber at the rear, arresting him on the spot. He was immediately taken to the police station for investigation, and the remaining accomplices were being pursued. The watch store suffered no losses as a result.</p>
<p>At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a woman was walking along Haizhou Road in Pudong when she was suddenly stopped by four robbers. One robber pulled out a gun and threatened her, stealing more than one hundred yuan in legal tender from her pocket. They fled in different directions. The incident was reported to the Yangshupu Police Station for investigation.</p>

<h3>Fire Incidents</h3>
<p>At 10:10 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in a bungalow at No. 33, Lane 343, Yangzho Rd., Pudong. Thick smoke filled the air. Upon receiving the news, the fire brigade immediately dispatched vehicles and extinguished the fire. As a result, one bungalow was burned down. At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the kitchen of the foreign manager's residence at No. 1, Foreign Apartment, No. 351 Albert Road. Upon receiving the news, the fire brigade immediately dispatched vehicles to put out the fire and extinguished it quickly. The damage was minimal. The cause of the fire was reportedly due to the carelessness of the chief steward.</p>
<p>A fire was reported at around 9:04 PM last night at a residence at No. 495, Maqi Road, Chedaijiao, Hongqiao. The flames were raging and unapproachable. It immediately spread to the neighboring houses at No. 496, No. 497, and No. 498. The fire brigade dispatched hose wagons and worked hard to put out the fire, which was extinguished at around 10:30 PM. As a result, four bungalows were burned down.</p>
<h3>Continuation of Vocational Training for Male and Female Refugee Trainees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center at No. 1200, Gordons Road, Xinzha, is the only organization in this city that provides production opportunities for refugees. Since its establishment more than a year ago, its various products, such as Chinese and Western furniture, various lacquerware, educational toys, embroidery of various sizes, towels, soap, etc., have been well received by the society. The National Government Relief and Rehabilitation Commission has repeatedly sent personnel to inspect it and has found the results to be excellent and has issued a commendation order. It is now heard that the first batch of refugee trainees at the center has completed their training and has successively left the center for employment. The center is now continuing to admit the second batch of refugee trainees. Any male or female refugees who are interested in learning a trade may apply for admission to the center with a guarantor. This is truly good news for the refugees.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities for Citizens: Vegetable Prices Rise, Fuel Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Scarce Vegetable Sources, Fuel Supply Exceeds Demand</p>
<p>The daily necessities for citizens, such as vegetables and fuel, have recently experienced some fluctuations. The reason for this is due to traffic congestion and erratic weather. However, poor citizens are finding that their income is not enough to cover their expenses, and they are all complaining bitterly. Here is a detailed account of the situation:</p>
<p>Vegetables: The various vegetables needed by citizens are transported to Shanghai for sale from the suburbs of Shanghai and the Ningbo production area. Although shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo has been smooth recently, and vegetables from Ningbo are arriving in a steady stream, suburban vegetable vendors are finding it difficult to purchase vegetables due to the changing situation. Furthermore, due to continuous rain, the roads are muddy, so most vegetable vendors are unable to transport vegetables. As a result, the supply is scarce and prices have risen. Small vegetable markets mainly sell chives, rape, and bok choy. The prices of fresh fish such as small yellow croaker have also risen. Purchasers are all complaining bitterly, and their burden has increased.</p>
<p>Fuel: The supply of white coal has been scarce in recent days, with only Hebei white coal being sold on the market. However, the origin of this white coal is questionable, so some coal merchants refuse to sell it on commission. Fortunately, the severe winter has passed, and usage is decreasing daily, so there is no cause for panic. Coal balls and coal have been shipped in large quantities in recent days, and prices have fallen slightly. A reporter from Xin Sheng She learned from the firewood and charcoal industry yesterday that although the fuel supply has been intermittent due to traffic congestion, the firewood and charcoal dealers have sent personnel to the Wenzhou production area to purchase firewood and charcoal. Once shipping is smooth, they will find ways to transport it to Shanghai. Therefore, although transportation is sometimes interrupted, the price can still be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Citizens Form Fundraising Committee, Hold Team Leader Meeting</h3>
<p>Submit Fundraising Results and Assign Sponsorship Numbers to Commence Within Days</p>
<p>The Citizens' Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association will hold its second team leader meeting tomorrow at 3:00 PM at the Central Vegetable Market on Fourth Malu to submit the results of the third round of fundraising and to discuss continuing to promote fundraising work. All 130-plus team leaders and deputy team leaders of the association will participate, and the chairman and secretary-general of the association will be invited to attend and provide guidance. The assignment of refugee sponsorship numbers and the distribution of refugee photographs and thank-you letters have been delayed until now because the Dunxin Road Reception Center has not yet completed its intake of refugees. The process is now being actively carried out and is nearing completion. It is heard that distribution to the philanthropists who have sponsored refugees will begin within days. In addition, the association has released statistics on sponsorship households, showing that as of the end of February, a total of 8,109 households have been sponsored, including 310 households sponsoring 5 people for more than six months, 228 households sponsoring 10 people for more than six months, and 28 households sponsoring 50 people for more than six months.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Association Holds Lottery Today</h3>
<p>The Central Savings Association holds a lottery every month on the 15th according to its regulations. The 36th lottery will be held today at 2:00 PM at the association's office at No. 2 Tianjin Road. The special prize money has reached more than 26,000 yuan. There are 26 prizes each for the first, second, third, and fourth prizes, as well as many consolation prizes and last-digit prizes. Those who wish to save can still pay to join the association before 11:00 AM today. The association will issue a temporary receipt with a number, which will entitle them to the generous lottery privileges.</p>
<h3>Women Applying to Be Postal Workers Have No Hope for Now</h3>
<p>Due to the Inconvenience of Transferring to Other Locations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration will henceforth focus on hiring men for postal worker positions. The opportunity for women to participate will be very limited. However, there is still a possibility for them to be hired as postal assistants. This is because female postal workers are not as easily transferred as men. However, this restriction may not be satisfactory to women who aspire to become postal workers. But given the current situation, women applying to be postal workers will have to wait for now.</p>
<h3>Puppet Municipal Government Levies "Ship Tax"</h3>
<p>The revenue of the puppet "municipal government" has been cut off, and it is experiencing financial difficulties. It is actively engaged in extortion to make up for the deficit. The puppet "Finance Bureau" has now established puppet "ship tax collection offices" in the puppet "Public Works Bureau's" Pudong and Hongqiao puppet "Ship Management Sub-Offices" to levy a puppet "ship tax." This was implemented simultaneously starting yesterday. Fearing that civilian boat owners would evade the puppet "tax," they have also dispatched sampans to board ships in the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek to forcibly collect the tax. The puppet officials are like wolves and tigers and are unreasonable. The puppet "tax" amount is very large and is levied quarterly. The planned rates are 1.20 yuan per quarter for paddle boats, 0.90 yuan for sampans, 1.75 yuan for cargo ships under 20 tons, 3.75 yuan for cargo ships under 40 tons, 8.50 yuan for cargo ships under 60 tons, 10.20 yuan for cargo ships under 80 tons, and 12 yuan for cargo ships over 80 tons.</p>
<h3>British Rear Admiral Inspects Lower Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that British Rear Admiral Holt of the Yangtze River Fleet left Shanghai yesterday (the 13th) aboard the British warship HMS Scorpion for Wuhu downstream to anchor for about three days. The ship will then sail to Wuhu and remain there for several days before returning to Shanghai. According to British naval personnel, this trip is a routine inspection.</p>
<h3>法租界消防隊　副隊長返法</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily News on the 14th, the deputy captain of the French Concession Fire Brigade, a sergeant, has returned to France on leave for recuperation.  Recently, the captain of the brigade, Luo Yiai, held a farewell ceremony for firefighters at Gujiazhai Park. In the evening, a tea party was held at the French General Association as a send-off.  It is also reported that among those who recently returned to their country on the French mail ship "Arashon" were Han Lishi, the manager of the Annam Tokyo Coal Company, and Dr. Jia Lun, a representative of the International Red Cross.</p>
<p>Expanding the Solicitation of Preferential Treatment for Manufacturers.  The Shanghai Municipal Primary School Education Personnel Consumer Cooperative has been established for nearly two months.  It has secured its address at Room 405, 4th Floor, No. 210 Jiujiang Road and is scheduled to open for business on March 16.  The goods operated will be temporarily limited to books, stationery, living materials, and daily necessities. Because the cooperative does not aim to make profits, the prices of goods are lower than the market prices. Now the cooperative is engaged in expanding contacts with manufacturers in order to obtain special preferential treatment. It is hoped that all manufacturers will enthusiastically support and participate in the success. The cooperative especially welcomes those who can proactively contact them.</p>
<p>Shaoxing natives Zhang Tianjue, Luo Lican, Zhu Xinpei, Huang Yantang, Liu Zhifang, Hu Hanzhu, etc., believe that there are many Shaoxing compatriots in Shanghai, but there is little contact on weekdays, so they organized the Jujishe Dinner Party. The publishing committee of the society has specially produced a "Shaoxing News," which specializes in publishing local news, so that people can know the news of their hometown. The newspaper is edited by Hu Hanzhu and has now been published.  Report of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall.

<h3>The Merit of Cold</h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>When the weather is cold and the ground is freezing, with ice and snow covering the roads, adding more cotton clothes does not provide warmth, and fingers drop and skin cracks, trees, flowers, crops, and even all kinds of birds and animals inevitably freeze to death, and humans also get sick and die from the cold. Therefore, many blame the harm caused by the cold. However, from the perspective of animal evolution, cold actually has a great merit.</p>
<p>(1) The Emergence of Warm-Blooded Animals</p>
<p>Approximately 200 million years ago (Mesozoic Era), there were many reptiles, and their bodies were also large. Various dinosaurs and flying reptiles were their representatives. The Earth underwent major changes, and ice ages appeared. The temperature dropped extremely low, making it difficult for various large reptiles to survive, and they gradually became extinct. However, some species that were good at adapting to the environment were able to increase the speed of their metabolism due to the excessive cold. Their body temperature rose, gradually changing from cold-blooded to warm-blooded, allowing them to maintain the vitality of their lives without becoming stiff and withered. Because of their agile physical activities, they were unwilling to be invaded by the cold on the ground, so they began to raise their bodies, moving away from the ground, unlike ordinary reptiles that kept their abdomen close to the ground. Through continuous evolution over a long period, birds and mammals eventually appeared.</p>
<p>(2) The Evolution of Animal Behavior</p>
<p>Mammals 60 million years ago (Cenozoic Era) were large-bodied and slow-moving, such as the large armadillo, the large tree shrew, and the elephant, which could live in temperate climates. During this era, there were four ice ages, and the threat of severe cold was even greater than before. Slow-moving animals could not escape in time and froze to death, leading to extinction. At that time, there were also smaller, faster-moving animals such as camels, rhinoceroses, elephants, and horses that could escape unharmed. Over time, they evolved into the species we have today.</p>
<p>(3) The Dawn of Human Culture</p>
<p>The theory that humans descended from apes is a scientific fact and there is no room for disagreement. During the most recent period (Pleistocene epoch), humans had already appeared in the world, and their lives were no different from those of other primates (apes, monkeys, and humans all belong to this category). They lived in forests, mostly living in trees. Later, the forests on the Earth were destroyed by glaciers, and primates migrated from north to south to avoid the severe cold, while glaciers also moved from north to south. When the forest areas were completely destroyed, primitive humans were forced to abandon their forest life and eagerly sought what they could eat and what they could wear to avoid the desperation of hunger and cold, in order to overcome nature and not be困 by the climate. Living in an icy and snowy environment, the threat of the environment became even greater. Humans, having evolved from primates, were superior to all apes, and their innate wisdom had to be used to the fullest. As their wisdom was used more and more, it evolved more and more. First, they invented the use of fire to reduce the invasion of cold. Then, they were able to drive various animals, eat their meat, and wear their skins to increase their ability to resist cold. They further controlled nature and created primitive culture.</p>
<h3>From Horse Racing Photography to Sound Films</h3>
<p>— Dan</p>
<p>It is said that in 1871, a senator from California named Stanford made a bet with someone, saying that a horse running fast would never have all four feet off the ground at the same time. Another Englishman, named Muybridge, placed many cameras along the side of the race track, using electrical contact to photograph the running horse. He proved that a running horse always had one foot on the ground. This incident indicated the possibility of moving pictures.</p>
<p>In 1880, Muybridge created a "zoopraxiscope" in San Francisco, which could project images from glass plates onto a screen. Later, he discussed with Edison about combining his zoopraxiscope with the phonograph. By 1883, he was abroad, often discussing this matter with Marey of the French Academy.</p>
<p>Marey was the first to use continuous film, although the credit for making continuous film as perfect as it is today must go to Eastman of the United States.</p>
<p>In 1893, Lumière created the first film projector. By 1896, Edison also invented his kinetoscope. These machines are the models for today's greatly improved movie cameras.</p>
<p>The earliest films were silent, and the plot and dialogue of the characters were indicated by subtitles. However, people at the time believed that silent films were just a transitional product, and sound films were definitely expected.</p>
<p>Sound films also came about through gradual improvements. At first, there was only musical accompaniment, then one or two songs or a segment of speech were interspersed into the film, and finally there were films with complete sound and dialogue.</p>
<p>How are these sound films made? There are two methods: One is easy to understand, because it uses the phonograph that we are familiar with. The difficulty of this method lies in how to make the rotation speed of the phonograph and the speed of the film completely consistent. After much research and experimentation, this problem was solved. The method is as follows: one or several microphones are used to make the sound waves cause fluctuations in the current. The current that fluctuates with the sound from the microphone is then introduced into a set of vacuum tube amplifiers, which amplify it sufficiently to drive the recorder. Then, this current is introduced into the recorder, which turns it into mechanical vibrations and records it on a soft wax disc. The camera and the turntable holding the wax disc are driven by two synchronous AC motors, which have equal speeds from beginning to end, so the action and speech are completely synchronized.</p>
<p>When playing the movie, this wax disc is placed on a turntable connected to the projector and driven by the same motor. The phonograph record and the film begin to play simultaneously. As the needle passes through the grooves in the wax disc, it causes a small magnet to vibrate, creating a weak current whose fluctuations are the same as the current in the microphone during filming. This current is then amplified and introduced into a loudspeaker, so the original sound is emitted. The above is the "Vitaphone" method.</p>
<p>Another method is to record sound on the edge of continuous film, which is the so-called "Movietone" method. In this method, as in the first method, the vibrations of the sound are first converted into current fluctuations in the microphone and amplified. Then, this amplified current is introduced into a glow discharge vacuum tube, whose light intensity depends on the fluctuations of the introduced current. This changing light, after passing through a narrow slit, is focused on the edge of the film by a set of lenses. Therefore, when the film is developed, not only does it show a set of pictures of the scene, but there is also a set of simultaneous sound pictures on both sides. These sound pictures are a series of lines of varying darkness or length, which correspond to the sound emitted by the microphone.</p>
<p>When using this method to project sound films, the film is passed through a film projector equipped with a sound attachment. In this attachment, a beam of light shines through the part of the film where the sound has been recorded, and the intensity and frequency of the light coming out of it vary according to the sound track. This changing light beam is projected onto a strange device that can sense light and generate electricity, called a photoelectric tube. As a result, a fluctuating current equivalent to the original sound is generated in the tube. This current is amplified and introduced into a powerful loudspeaker close to the back of the screen, emitting a sound that is synchronized with the action in the film.</p>
<h3>The Parachute Jump Tower at the New York World's Fair</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>Everyone Can Try It</p>
<p>Now is a period of advancement in aviation technology, and countries are sparing no effort in promoting the aviation industry.</p>
<p>Towers for practicing parachuting are gradually being adopted by the aviation industry to give beginner pilots some experience with parachuting. Therefore, the International Parachute Practice Association has built a parachute jump tower at this World's Fair to give visitors a chance to try it out, in order to attract public attention.</p>
<p>Aviators need sufficient experience to suddenly jump out of an airplane when the parachute is not open. The tower has, of course, minimized all the normal dangers of parachuting, and there is no need to teach passengers how to pull the rope or move the mechanism to make the parachute open automatically.</p>
<p>The parachute on the tower is 32 feet in diameter, and it is kept permanently open by a large metal ring. The person trying it is strapped into a two-person seat suspended under the parachute, which is very stable and comfortable. When a mechanism is flipped, the parachute descends. When the parachute descends, it is prevented from swinging because the edges are limited by vertical steel cables. Furthermore, because of a special device that absorbs vibrations, there is no shock when landing. After the parachute reaches the ground, it can be pulled back to the top of the tower for another person to try.</p>
<p>The tower has a total of eleven parachutes, which are all available at any time. Each ascent or descent takes about one and a half minutes. Although the person trying it cannot get the full experience of parachuting from an airplane, they can at least get a novel experience and get a chance to overlook the entire field from a height of 250 feet. The entire tower weighs 170 pounds, but its construction is so clever that it can be dismantled and used elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Large and Small Conveniences</h3>
<p>— Qiaoxia Ke</p>
<p>What I want to talk about is defecation and urination, cough, it really is a stinky article!</p>
<p>In the past, there was a self-proclaimed talented scholar who chanted seven characters: "Looking from afar, the city wall is like sawtooths," and thought it was amazing. Therefore, he thought that Yan Yuan was the only person among the ancients who was like him, so he thought of his short life and cried bitterly. His neighbor ran over to ask the reason and comforted him, saying that Yan Yuan was drowned because the lower path was blocked. Your feet can let out good farts, so there is no worry about your life.</p>
<p>Whether defecation or urination is blocked, if it exceeds a certain degree, there is indeed a risk of death. Therefore, large and small conveniences are very important to life. Now, let's talk casually about the knowledge of the imperial examination about the two conveniences. We think that defecation is always transformed from the things that are eaten. That's right, but it's not entirely true, and it's bound to cause misunderstanding. Try asking a few midwifery ladies, they can tell you that newborn babies often poop a pile of feces. This dung comes from the womb, so it is called meconium. The fetus has never eaten yellow rice, green vegetables, or even European and American dishes in the mother's womb. This dung is transformed from the fetus's own things. So if you want to say it all, you should say that part of the defecation comes from external food, and another part of the defecation comes from internal things. If we think about it again, we won't misunderstand that all the things that are eaten are transformed into defecation, because in this way, we are eating in vain. Children eat milk to grow meat. How can they grow bigger day by day if they are completely transformed into defecation? The most annoying thing about defecation is that special woody fragrance. We can't help but ask, if we eat fragrant things, why do we poop out stinky things? Where is the transformation? It turns out that after digestion, what comes next when passing through the intestinal tract is putrefaction. There is not much difference in principle between this "transformation" and that "transformation." In herbivorous animals, putrefaction helps digestion. However, putrefaction produces stinky things, so people have to cover their noses and sigh. However, I have to declare one thing: a certain stinky substance in feces has the fragrance of jasmine when it is in a pure state, and some hair tonics even use it. Now we have to call urination. Try to think of the human body as a coal-burning stove—this is an inappropriate analogy, but it is still useful—then, the chimney and the door under the stove together are the lungs, the semi-coked coal lumps containing gravel are defecation, and the ashes left after burning are urination. People who walk past the "No Urinating" sign and urinate more often hum the old tune of "stinky and unbearable," but this is no longer the true color of urination. Urination has the fragrance of freshly cooked meat soup when it first comes out. If you don't believe it, please compare it with each other. In ancient times, there was a method of drinking children's urine in our country. I don't know what it was based on at that time. Now I know that in certain situations, urination (not necessarily children's urine) contains other valuable things related to health besides ashes. Its name is called hormone, which can be said to be a modern tonic, with the same popularity as vitamins. So eating urination, although it is unavoidable to be a bit old-fashioned, as long as you eat it properly, it is harmless.</p>
<p>The talk box must end; since the content of large and small conveniences is mainly residual coal and ashes, we know that poor output will inevitably hinder combustion, and blocked output will cause the stove to go out. Wasn't the famous Yan Yuan also short-lived because of the blocked lower path? But I must solemnly declare that this is what the talented scholar's neighbor said.</p>

<p>The 1939 New York World's Fair, which is about to open, has buried a memorial tube made of special materials 50 feet deep under the Westinghouse display building in order to preserve an accurate record of modern life, that is, various items representing the present era, for 5,000 years. Its outer shell weighs 800 pounds and is made of a copper alloy called Cupaloy.</p>
<p>Various commemorative items—including the recipe for making Cupaloy—are sealed in a six-foot-long inner tube. This tube is made of heat-resistant glass, and the air inside the tube is evacuated and replaced with inert gas as a preservative. After sealing, it is wrapped with glass tape and covered with waterproof material, and then placed inside the Cupaloy outer tube, and the outer tube is sealed tightly.</p>
<p>The Cupaloy alloy is made of copper, chromium, and a small amount of silver. It is as hard as copper. It is the result of five years of research by scientists at Westinghouse Electric Company. These researchers found that mixing silver into copper-chromium can increase the strength of copper and chromium. They believe that this outer shell can resist the erosion of seawater seeping into the New York foundation for 5,000 years. Once copper is etched, it is covered with a protective film, which can prevent the internal metal from being further eroded by seawater. Scientists believe that the presence of chromium in this copper alloy can increase the protective effect of this film.</p>

<p>Milk Can Be Made into Wine</p>
<p>The Danish milk industry has a by-product when making milk, namely the water in the milk, which is produced in large quantities, but has not been utilized. They have been working hard to study how to turn this discarded liquid into a useful food. One recent result of the research is that a fine wine can be made from the water in milk. Although this method is still in the experimental stage, if milk sheds all over Denmark adopt this method, based on the possible results now, 1.5 million Danish kroner can be obtained each year.</p>

<p>Fertilizers Can Preserve Beets</p>
<p>Beet growers and sugar producers often pile up beets, causing them to rot and suffer losses. According to recent test results, using phosphate as a fertilizer to cultivate beets can not only increase production but also increase the potential to resist decay. Beets grown from soil lacking phosphate decay three to five times more than those grown from soil with adequate phosphate.</p>

<p>Sweaty Odor Also Has Uses</p>
<p>The sweaty odor excreted by the human body now also has uses in industry. Human sebacic acid is an important component in human sweaty odor. Scientists are now synthesizing it into an important raw material with a wide range of uses. It can be used to make plasticizers to soften plastics, and it can also be used to make a new resin to produce a fiber that is far superior to ordinary rayon. Capric acid is related to the sweaty odor on goats, just like sebacic acid is related to the human body. Since it was synthesized into an industrial raw material recently, it has also had many important uses.</p>
<p>The products made from this acid do not necessarily have the same odor. Many products not only have no odor but also have a fragrance.</p>

<p>Radio Ultrashort Waves Can Bend</p>
<p>Radio ultrashort waves have always been thought to travel in straight lines like light, but according to a recent report from the California Institute of Technology in the United States, ultrashort waves can actually bend around the Earth's surface, so scientists' dreams of using ultrashort waves to create secret wartime signals have been dealt a major blow. Professors Potapenko and Epstein of the institute have recently completed their preliminary research, indicating that 5-meter and 1-meter long radio waves can be received at sea 18 miles apart.</p>

<h3>Seeing Off Students "Throwing Down the Pen to Join the Army"</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>More than ten students from Fudan and Datong Universities in this city have already set off for the interior to serve the country the day before yesterday. They truly put into practice the saying "throwing down the pen to join the army."</p>
<p>However, we know that Ban Dingyuan's motive for "throwing down the pen to join the army" was "to achieve merit in foreign lands and obtain a noble title," focusing entirely on personal gain. But our departing gentlemen are focused entirely on the independence and freedom of the nation and people. Compared to Ban, this "throwing down the pen to join the army" has more meaning. We have always admired Ban Dingyuan, considering him ambitious in his youth, so how can we not solemnly pay our respects to these ten-odd students serving the nation and wish them an early triumphant return!</p>
<p>I do not know these ten-odd loyal and courageous youths, nor do I know what their living environment is like in Shanghai. But the newspaper says they are all "sons of wealthy families," which arouses my boundless respect and admiration even more.</p>
<p>I have seen many "sons of wealthy families" in Shanghai. Generally speaking, their attitude is frivolous; they frequent dance halls and brothels; they do not read books, and even when they are in school, they are just going through the motions; they do not know about the world or the country, they only know about fine wine and women; they are not promising young people, but rather dregs of a patriarchal society, spoiled young masters; they are simply not human, but walking corpses! ... I have completely despaired of them, believing that China would be better off without this group of treasures—forgive me for not being able to say that sentence.</p>
<p>Now, these ten-odd "sons of wealthy families" have finally earned a breath of fresh air for others of their status, giving me hope again from despair. Therefore, personally, I am even more grateful to these ten-odd young people. I must pay them solemn respect and wish them an early triumphant return.</p>
<p>The turbulence of the times is still ceaselessly ongoing, and there must be many more who will be inspired to rise up! I do not necessarily advocate that all young students in Shanghai should go to the interior to serve the country like these ten-odd students—if everyone were willing to do so, of course, that would be the best—but I believe that every sensible young student can think for themselves whether or not to embark on this glorious path; if they want to, I hope they will go without hesitation! If they don't want to, then they should also lead a serious life in Shanghai and seek other ways to serve the country, instead of being confused and decadent!</p>
<p>These ten-odd students are the first batch to set off this year. I hope to use my worn-out pen to see off a second, third, and even countless more batches like this soon.</p>
<h3>Song of Dawn</h3>
<p>— Li Chen</p>
<p>In the winding mountains, the highway climbs over them, sometimes high, sometimes low: the tortuous river intersects with it, forming a small plain.</p>
<p>Asking about the time, it was a few months after the storm. Under the coercion of death and cold, no breath of life could be found here. The villages, near and far, had turned to ashes. Standing on the bridge, one could see the distance without obstruction; the naked wilderness spread out silently. The wilderness road, symbolizing the terror of death, stretched into the boundless distance, longer and longer.</p>
<p>By the bridge with barbed wire, there appeared two puppet-like soldiers. To break the silence, the short, fat one was humming a song randomly; the other, tall and thin, stood aside, his eyes darting around like a rat's. "Bring your gun and compare it with mine!"</p>
<p>The short, fat one suddenly ordered loudly. The other person, as if waking from a dream, slowly took down his gun.</p>
<p>"Hehe, it's more than an inch shorter than mine!" When the two guns were placed together, his bloated body moved around like a drunkard. Then, he laughed "victoriously": "Haha, how can the guns of subjugated people be any good?"</p>
<p>The insulted man frowned in anguish, and then he thought of home. "Hehe, the gun of the subjugated…" The laughter rang out greedily again.</p>
<p>He finally made up his mind. He felt that this was a good opportunity when he saw the arrogant face and the short gun on his body.</p>
<p>"Bang!"</p>
<p>Just like a full tire deflating, the result of the arrogant glutton was lying stiff on the ground forever!</p>
<p>The sunset dyed the azure blue sky with various colors of clouds. Under the crimson sunlight, the lazy earth was covered with a layer of shadows. The tall and thin man, holding two "German-made" long guns, walked down the bridge vigorously.</p>
<p>"Go down!" With a forceful kick of his big leather boots, the short, fat body rolled down into the river. Then he hummed:</p>
<p>I feel that I should do this, parents, wife,… the death of the whole family. How can it stop me! Wake up, dead wilderness! Spring is waiting for your waking yawns! This is the eve of dawn. If you don't go to greet it, you will miss it forever!</p>
<p>He had already climbed up the hillside, his eyes shining with a green light, gazing into the distance, "After crossing that mountain, it should be the headquarters of the guerrillas!" he thought.</p>
<p>The approaching night closed in from all directions, making the earth even more silent. However, he was not alone, because the song of victory accompanied him on his way.</p>
<p>Half an hour ago, he was still a scourge of the earth; and now? He was already the earth's nanny!</p>
<h3>Must Speak</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>In a certain place, at a certain time, or to a certain person, if speaking is inappropriate, it is called a "slip of the tongue." The result of a slip of the tongue can even cause "disaster from the mouth," so it can be seen that speaking must be careful. Confucius said, "Speak after considering the time." This "time" makes great sense, and can include time, place, and person. He was "a sage who knew the times," and the "time" of speaking probably helped him become a "sage" quite a bit.</p>
<p>But now some people do not study these things, and even violate these important elements of speaking, but not only will they not cause "disaster," they can still become "celebrities," "scholars," or "tycoons" in a certain field. After all, "those who come later surpass those who came before," and perhaps the ancients are not as good as the present people in this regard.</p>
<p>There is a certain celebrity who, when he was not successful, would always go on stage or stand up to speak whenever there was a public gathering, regardless of how many people were there, who they were, or what they were discussing. Sometimes his words were endless, and he could speak for one or two hours, making people feel confused, but sometimes they were extremely simple, only these few sentences: "Today, I am very happy to be able to meet you all. Today, I am very happy to be able to meet you all."</p>
<p>He was very bold, and even in gatherings of Europeans and Americans, he would solemnly go on stage or stand up, and repeatedly say in a solemn and forceful tone, "Ladies and Gentlemen Ladies and Gentlemen." After saying it a few times, with nothing further to say, he would bow or nod and walk down from the microphone or sit down with composure.</p>
<p>It is said that there are many people who speak everywhere like this, although some are more clever than this celebrity, and indeed speak more fluently, or have some meaning in what they say. As for what their purpose is, I think everyone can guess, it is nothing more than wanting to stand out.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many ways to stand out, and it is not necessary to "must speak" like this. This can be said to be the hardline faction, and there is also a softline faction that makes people believe him without realizing it. The "must speak" of the softline faction is like this!</p>
<p>In Mr. A's place, he must mention Mr. B, whose status, reputation, and influence are similar to Mr. A's, and seems to casually mention that Mr. B and he have some close relationship, or work together, or have intimate conversations, or engage in the same kind of entertainment. In Mr. B's place, he can naturally say grandly how he had been at Mr. A's place, with exaggerated descriptions and dazzling details, all of which are relevant to the topic. Similarly, in Mr. C's place and even Mr. X's place, he can consistently use the same kind of "must" speak. Over time, these gentlemen will all consider him "Old So-and-so," "Brother So-and-so," "one of us," or "a very familiar person." The magic is beyond words, and he will surely stand out.</p>
<p>However, the skill of the softline faction is more difficult than that of the hardline faction, although the success of the softline faction is faster and greater. He can no longer be as "incoherent" or "irrelevant" as the hardline faction. In addition to having a composed attitude and a very good appearance, he must have tactful language that can win the favor of the person he is talking to. He must have some "three-legged cat" knowledge of the three religions and nine streams, the hundred schools of thought, and when he speaks, it seems to make sense, as if it were a very important matter. Otherwise, if he opens his mouth and shows his throat, the Mr. So-and-so across from him will "look at him in a different light."</p>
<p>However, the softline faction and the hardline faction still have one thing in common, which serves as the vanguard of "must speak," and that is a thick skin. "With great courage and a thick face, you can go anywhere," that is what it means.</p>
<p>"A lady does not speak, but when she speaks, she hits the mark"; "When speaking, one must praise Yao and Shun"; "Words must be trustworthy." If "must speak" is reversed to become such "speak must," then the world will truly be at peace!</p>
<h3>Late Night Soliloquy</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Life and education have shaped me into a somewhat reserved person, which has brought me countless long and dark days. The door to happiness seems to be permanently closed to me, and I have never found the key to open paradise. In the shadow of sentimentality, I live alone, and my childhood world is decorated with extreme coldness.</p>
<p>There is often a trace of sorrow planted deep in my heart, and a hint of melancholy locked in the depths of my soul, but I always keep them tightly sealed, preventing others from peeking. In fact, it is for the sake of others. I know that happiness is not easily shared, but sorrow can be easily infected. So why add to people's troubles?</p>
<p>In the quiet midnight, I ponder in silence, finally opening the brocade box of memory, like a wealthy guest, playing with the jewelry of the past. Unfortunately, most of them are dull and colorless, without dazzling brilliance. I flip through them again and again, but in the end, I cannot help but sigh and quietly put them away.</p>
<p>When I reach old age, when I am about to reach the end of my life, it would be so sad to look back on the road I have taken and find it so desolate and lonely, I think. I have neither rolled around in storms nor entered and left in the flames of war, but have only been trapped in my personal quagmire, doing a few somersaults. Is human life so ordinary, and is my life going to end just like this? I ask.</p>
<p>Optimists say, "The world is a stage, and life is a drama." But I disagree with this view. Destiny is kneaded in our own hands, and people are not destined to play certain roles. But I am often destroyed by pain, enduring the grinding of time, and the yawns and sighs in the courtyard take away my youth.</p>
<p>The words of a friend strike my mind like lightning: "The fate that lies before our generation of young people is tragic enough. Like myself, I have suffered from the destruction of feudal forces since I was very young, planting a negative mentality, and I have long understood sadness and sorrow. But now I am resisting fate, accompanying everyone in striving for the liberation of the nation. Struggle is painful, but it also has joy. Difficult destiny will increase our spirit of non-compromise. Quickly raise your fighting arm and hold up the banner of resistance." I begin to try to raise that arm—I feel heavy, but in the end, I will finally raise it, right?</p>
<p>In the distance, a cock crows, and dawn is approaching.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Hepu Town has fallen. After the fall of Hepu Town, the first person to become active was Tu Dong Yang Yue Liang. He felt that now was the time for him to regain his lost position and rise to replace Town Chief Chen. Fortunately, he was divinely inspired to paste a piece of red paper on a white bamboo cloth, which he actually made into a flag. He then led a few shady characters, calling himself a representative of the "Maintenance Society," and, carrying the flag, came out to welcome the X Army.</p>
<p>He was confident that in this way, the position of chairman of the "Maintenance Society" would surely fall into his hands. Who knew that One-Eyed Li glanced at him from the side, whispered a few words to the translator, and the translator said a few more words to a monkey-faced officer named Ali Ada. The officer glared and shouted, and several X Army soldiers grabbed him like eagles grabbing chickens. Yang Yueliang was so scared that he kept shouting "Innocent!" One-Eyed Li smiled coldly and ordered him to lead the way to capture the entire family of Commander Ye.</p>
<p>Commander Ye's entire family had already boarded a boat, and at this moment, with a favorable wind and water, they were already ten miles away. One-Eyed Li, unable to vent his anger, ordered his men to set fire to Commander Ye's house, burning it to the ground.</p>
<p>As if it had become a convention, whenever the × Army arrived at a place, they would carry out a large-scale burning, killing, raping, and looting. Now that Hepu Town had fallen into their hands, it was naturally impossible to escape this calamity. Thus, the idyllic paradise of Hepu Town quickly turned into a dark and gloomy hell, and the civilians who had not escaped all tasted the unprecedented suffering of the human world.</p>
<p>Yang Yueliang was taken back to his own home. His high-rise building, although spared from the shelling, was occupied as the headquarters of the X Army. At this time, he not only dared not harbor the illusion of becoming the chairman of the "Maintenance Society," but he did not even want to reclaim his house. He only hoped that the X Army would be merciful and release him, so that he could find a way to transport the silver hidden in his house and escape to another place, to live a peaceful life.</p>
<p>Who knew that even this minimum hope would not be satisfied. One-Eyed Li, as soon as he opened his mouth, demanded that he pay 100,000 yuan to the X Army as military expenses. (33)</p>

<h3>Afraid of the Little Wife</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Nothing much to talk about, let's talk about being afraid of the little wife. "This place only discusses romance, it is okay to sleep and smoke cigarettes." In this day and age, in addition to dusting one's shoulders off, sleeping, and eating, practicing the three major principles, please don't say anything. "Eat more, talk less" is originally the philosophy of life for preserving oneself wisely, seeking good fortune and avoiding bad fortune. If you don't know what's good for you and still want to talk nonsense, maybe you will commit the sin of erotic thoughts like in Dream of the Red Chamber, so it is okay to talk about the way of husband and wife.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I saw a topic on the supplement of a certain newspaper, "Afraid of the Wife," but because smoking a cigarette was important, I didn't read the article carefully, which is a pity. This topic is quite interesting. I think wives can always be talked about, it doesn't violate the laws of the boudoir, and being afraid of the wife is even more okay, but the topic seems too outdated. In fact, it is not outdated. There is heaven and then there are all things, there are all things and then there are men and women, there are men and women and then there are husband and wife. Since the establishment of the rites of the Duke of Zhou, the system of husband and wife has been established, and "the three cardinal guides and the five constant virtues, the grand classics of propriety," have been established as an immutable law for thousands of years, so before the rites of the Duke of Zhou are abolished, it is still worth talking about.</p>
<p>Within the family, the republican system cannot be implemented, and fascism arises in response to the trend. It is either the husband's autocracy or the wife's tyranny. Being afraid of the wife and seeking quiet is originally a virtue of obeying the wife's authority in the family. The principle of the three obediences and four virtues does not necessarily belong to women, but also applies to men. Recently, women's rights are rampant and they are still singing that they are not men's playthings, which is really a injustice. Men are really women's playthings, how can women be men's playthings! Since the beginning of history, I don't know how many anecdotes about being afraid of the wife have been spread. The ancient teachings say, "If there is a virtuous wife in the family, the husband will not suffer misfortune." Assuming that a man can obey his wife's orders in everything, even if it doesn't mean that you have to be afraid of your wife to get rich, it will guarantee that you will be broad-minded and happy in everything. I think this saying is extremely reasonable. Assuming that a man is not afraid of his wife, he is really hopeless. The men I fear most are those who gesticulate at home, act recklessly, and treat their wives like servants, the so-called "fierce at the threshold," but when they go out, they dare not speak up to friends and relatives, and bow their heads in submission. I despise this kind of person the most. On the contrary, those who obey every order at home, prostrate themselves under high heels, greatly fearing their wives, but when they go out, no one buys their account, the so-called "subjected to one person, superior to ten thousand," this kind of person is worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>I very much agree with being afraid of the wife, but I absolutely do not agree with being afraid of the little wife. Between husband and wife, there must have been mutual love, and there must have been vows of eternal love. Now, seeing the old and faded wife and the flamboyant little wife, they go to favor the little wife and put the old wife out of their minds, even listening to the little wife and abusing the original wife, the so-called "only seeing the new person smile, not hearing the old person cry," evolving into a tragedy of favoring concubines and abusing wives. Such facts are often seen in society, how can it be said? Therefore, I do not approve of being afraid of the little wife, but I greatly approve of being afraid of the old wife.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Jingwu Athletic Association</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Established for thirty years, with tens of thousands of members, a wide range of activities, and also established academic classes, etc.</p>
<p>We all know that there is a Jingwu Athletic Association in Shanghai. Before the outbreak of the war, at grand commemorative festivals and amusement parks, we would sometimes see male and female members of the Jingwu Athletic Association performing martial arts, and their profound attainments had unique features. Recently, the Jingwu Athletic Association is recruiting members again; therefore, I want to write about the general situation of the association below:</p>
<p>The Jingwu Athletic Association was established two years before the Republic of China. However, in the short history of thirty years, it has expanded from Shanghai to various provinces, and even the South Seas Islands have branches. The number of members has expanded from a few to tens of thousands. The development of the association can be said to be very rapid, right? In the past thirty years, it has held nineteen large-scale member solicitation conferences, and this recruitment is the thirtieth time.</p>
<p>The main goal of the Jingwu Athletic Association is to enable people in general professional circles to pay a small membership fee and have the opportunity to exercise their bodies, sweeping away the nickname "sick man of East Asia," which is a very good intention. We only need to see that the members of the association, whether male or female, who study martial arts, all have strong bodies, and it is not difficult to see what kind of contributions the association has made to the country and the nation in the past thirty years.</p>
<p>Anyone who joins the Jingwu Athletic Association as a member can enjoy all the facilities of the association, such as bathrooms, libraries, billiard rooms, various indoor sports, and outdoor sports. Renting dormitories can also reduce the rent, and joining various research-oriented academic associations can also reduce membership fees. They can also participate in various group activities, such as travel and visits. Before "August 13th," the headquarters of the Jingwu Athletic Association was on North Sichuan Road. To make it convenient for general members, several branch associations were set up in Nanshi, Zhabei, and the central concession, so that members could practice Taijiquan and various martial arts and national arts nearby. However, after "August 13th," North Sichuan Road became a dead city, and the headquarters of the Jingwu Athletic Association moved to the upper floors of the mainland market—Cishu Building—so that the association's affairs would not be interrupted.</p>
<p>The current headquarters is the former branch association in the Special Zone, on the third floor of the mainland market. Although the location is not large, if you walk in, you can see many young people playing table tennis, playing billiards, and chatting there. There is also a place, a long and narrow side, with some thick carpets and weapons piled on the floor, which is where members practice national arts every morning. In the big city, there is luxury and debauchery everywhere, and this corner of the market has such a group that exercises the body and mind of young people, which people who have not been there do not know, right?</p>
<p>In the eyes of the general public, perhaps the Jingwu Athletic Association is a group concentrated on martial arts, but the fact is not so. The Jingwu Athletic Association currently has a wide range of activities, including national arts classes, Taijiquan research groups, wrestling classes, Western boxing classes, table tennis teams, tennis teams, swimming teams, libraries, Mandarin Sunday classes, Mandarin crash courses, Chinese shorthand classes, calligraphy classes, drama classes, Peking opera classes, Cantonese opera classes, and cartoon classes. It can be seen that this group emphasizes both literary and martial arts, and not only advocates martial arts, but also activities in various aspects such as sports, language, and art, and members who join can join the above various classes according to their personal preferences to study everything!</p>
<h3>Feng Yu Mei (6)</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Scene Ten</p>
<p>(Four flag bearers enter, followed by four armored soldiers, sounding Jiang lips, announcing their names) We are Zhang Xian, Wang Gui, Xu Qing, and Niu Gao. Greetings! The marshal ascends the tent, and we are here to serve on either side. (The adjutant enters, followed by Yue, leading) With unwavering loyalty, we protect the magnificent land of the Song Dynasty. (Opening verse) Courage soars through the heavens, vowing to repay the emperor's debt. Eliminating the Yuan villains to restore the imperial carriage, I seek no grand title. I am Yue Fei, Military Commissioner of Qingyuan, Regional Pacifier of Hubei Road Jingxiang Tanzhou, and Viscount of Wuchang County. Jin Wuzhu has joined forces with Liu Yu, and they have already seized Luzhou. His Majesty has bestowed a personal edict, ordering me to lead troops to recover it. Now, encamped outside Luzhou City, I challenged the Jin soldiers earlier, but they kept their gates tightly shut and ignored me. What is to be done? (Xiao Sheng enters with four henchmen, singing) Through wind and dust, we hasten forward, unknowingly arriving at Yue's camp. (Speaks) I am Fan Xizhou. I heard that Yue's army is encamped outside Luzhou City, so I traveled thousands of miles with my brothers. Fearing General Han's pursuit of the remaining Fan clan members, I changed my name to He Chengxin and came to offer my services! Who's at the gate? (Adjutant) Who is causing a commotion here? (Xiao Sheng) We are here to join the army. (Adjutant) Reporting, there are those seeking to join the army outside the gate. (Yue) Bring them into the tent. (Adjutant) You are summoned into the tent, be cautious! (Xiao Sheng) Understood! (Says with henchmen) Greetings, Marshal. (Yue) Rise. You have come to join the army? (Xiao Sheng) Indeed. (Yue) What skills do you possess? (Xiao Sheng) I, He Chengxin, can scale walls and climb ladders. Even a hundred-foot city wall can be scaled in an instant, taking the enemy by surprise. These are my trusted confidants, who have all learned my skills and are brave and skilled in battle. I beg you to accept us. (Yue) You have come at the right time. Here is a command arrow. I order you to climb the city wall at the third watch tonight and open the gate to welcome our army, without fail. I will send troops to assist you. After the success, you will be promoted. (Xiao Sheng) Understood! (Exits with four henchmen) (Yue) Wang Gui, listen to my command! He Chengxin is newly arrived, and although his appearance seems honest, there may be deception. Therefore, I order you to dispatch a small team to assist He Chengxin in his success at the third watch tonight, thereby monitoring him, without fail! (Wang) Understood! (Exits) (Yue) Niu Gao, Xu Qing, listen to my command! I order you to be the vanguard, leading two thousand soldiers, to attack Luzhou City at the third watch. (Niu, Xu) Understood! (Exits) (Yue) Zhang Xian, listen to my command! I order you to lead two thousand soldiers and lie in ambush in the Shouzhou area to ambush the enemy soldiers. (Zhang) Understood! (Exits) (Yue) Close the gate. (Music plays, Yue exits with four flag bearers and adjutant)</p>
<p>Scene Eleven (Jin Wuzhu and Liu Yu, wearing crooked hats and barefoot, enter) (Jin) Oh dear! I was sleeping soundly in the middle of the night when the Southerners descended from the sky. They opened the city gate, and a large army surged in. I don't know how many soldiers and weapons our army lost. I escaped from the city and managed to save my old life. Old Liu, how could you not have taken precautions? You deserve to die! (Liu) Yes, yes, yes! (Aside) If you haven't been a traitor, you don't know the suffering of being a traitor; once you've been a traitor, the grandson of a bitch wants to be a traitor again! Everything has gone wrong, so I deserve to be scolded. (To Jin) Next time, I will definitely be careful! (Jin) Heh heh! Being careful is already too late! Let's flee to Shouzhou for our lives. (Liu, aside) Let me also pay him a few compliments. (To Jin) Didn't Your Highness once say that you would reach Lin'an in seven days and annex China in three months? How could a small Luzhou be lost in an instant? (Jin) This – words cannot be spoken like that. We must make the Southerners kneel before us. Fighting for three or five years is not a problem, even ten or a hundred years, we must fight on. (Liu) Your Highness changes direction so quickly! (Xiao Sheng and henchmen rush in) Halt! Are you Jin Wuzhu and the puppet Liu Yu, who sells out the country for glory? Take my spear! (They fight, Jin and Liu flee, Xiao Sheng and henchmen chase after them. Xiao Sheng enters again) I chased and killed all the way, beheading more than eighty heads. Just as I was about to end the life of the chief culprit, they escaped. I must report back to the commander! (Exits)</p>
<h3>The Young Mistress's Fan</h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>Hua Xin Production, China United Distribution, Xin Guang Premiere. "The Young Mistress's Fan" is a very famous stage play, and like "Sunrise," it has been brought to the screen without embellishment amidst a shortage of scripts.</p>
<p>Although this is an early work, it does not address the most pressing issues we face today; however, the aspects it reflects still exist. Superficially, society seems to have undergone significant changes, but feudal dregs have not been eliminated! — Men destroying women's chastity while denouncing their lack of shame is still a common occurrence. Oscar Wilde wrote "The Young Mistress's Fan" with emotional, poignant, and satirical tones to refute this erroneous notion.</p>
<p>Does the character played by Lu Luming in the play deserve our scorn? Society will undoubtedly attack her extravagant lifestyle. However, Wilde points out that this is the selfishness of a male-dominated society and the cruel punishment inflicted on women. Why did Lu Luming run away? It was because of her husband's infidelity. She did not want an unfaithful husband and resolutely left for her own happiness. Then why didn't she become a virtuous woman after leaving her husband? It was not her own willingness to degenerate; it was society! — A group of devils surrounded her, forcing her to lead such an absurd life, like the characters played by Sun Jingyou and Guang Zhaoguan. They had mocked her, but then desperately demanded her company. She also wanted to improve herself, but the "reputation" created by feudal concepts prevented her from moving forward. For the sake of "reputation," her husband did not have the courage to take her back; for the sake of "reputation," she could not even be close to her own daughter. Isn't this the cruelty of feudal society?</p>
<p>Wilde wrote the character of Lu Luming with the greatest sympathy. When we see her unwilling to let her own daughter follow in her footsteps, enduring all the insults from her daughter, we are almost moved to tears.</p>
<p>The film adaptation of "The Young Mistress's Fan" is not much different from the stage version; even the era has not been changed.</p>
<p>The director has made much more progress than in "Feng Qiu Huang," which proves that the quality of the script is of great importance. I think the best scene he handled was when Lu Luming went to her daughter's banquet, entered, and naturally reached out to take Mei Xi's arm, followed by close-ups of everyone whispering, and then Mei Xi introduced Lu Luming to Yuan Meiyun (her daughter), and she collapsed dejectedly, her fan slipping from her hand. These shots were very provocative. As for the scene where Lu Luming persuaded Yuan Meiyun to go home, although it was very touching, it was ultimately due to the quality of the script. In small details, such as the scene where Lu Luming and Mei Xi talked in the garden, and the scene where Liu Qiong and Yuan Meiyun talked in the garden, the director seemed to want to prove that there were "visitors" in the garden, so there were extras walking behind the main actors; in fact, it was not necessary in the plot, and it detracted from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Lu Luming's performance this time was very good, but her movements were still stiff. Yuan Meiyun's performance in the scenes after being awakened by Lu Luming was very lively. Mei Xi was only better in the scenes where he was hiding his contact with Lu Luming from Yuan Meiyun; some other scenes lacked flexibility. Liu Qiong and Chuan William also gave good performances.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Praising One Person as a Talent, Three Talents Rising Together; Narrating Friendship, Two Gentlemen Meet with Heroes</p>
<p>It is said that Zhu Airen went to Suzhou and picked up the two young ladies, He Shuangyu and He Liyu, asking them whether they would stay in the Women and Children's Hospital or go to Freedom Village. The two young ladies discussed it and said, "We are willing to stay in your hospital. Although Freedom Village is quiet, you cannot accompany us, and it will make you worry about both places. Instead, you will have to come to Freedom Village to take care of us, which makes us uneasy. Staying in the hospital for a few days will also allow us to visit and see the hard work of your service. But don't let us disturb your work there." Zhu Airen said, "Although you are staying in the hospital, the place where we live is in a separate residence, but it is very close to the hospital. If you don't want to see patients, you don't have to see them. But our hospital is different from other hospitals. Other hospitals are of course full of patients. Although we are called a hospital, most of the people inside are not patients. Think about how a pregnant woman is not a patient, and the babies born are not patients. Although some pregnant women are sick and some babies are sick, those who are well cared for are in the minority. Especially those babies, it is really lovely to see them. If you see those little angels, you will also find them lovely. Since that is the case, you should stay in the hospital for a few days first, and then go to Freedom Village for a few days. Because we also want to set up a small branch in Freedom Village." He Liyu said, "That would be great! But we are afraid that we will disturb your work after we come." Zhu Airen said, "Definitely not! My work also has a fixed time. I start inspecting the wards and the pregnant women's rooms at 9:00 a.m. and finish around 11:00 a.m. In the afternoon, I go to inspect the nurseries and the children's wards at 2:00 p.m. and finish around 4:00 p.m. There are many gaps in between, and I can come to accompany you, and I also come back to the mansion to eat, so how can it hinder my work? But when I am working, you are free to play and do not necessarily need me to accompany you." From Suzhou to Freedom Village, or to Zhu Airen's Women and Children's Hospital, there is a very good highway. These highways have a wide and solid surface. Because Suzhou has a highway bureau that is responsible for the highways everywhere, and if there is any damage, it is repaired immediately. This place is called a water town, so naturally there are many bridges along the way. Many of them are highways built before the war, and the bridges are not very strong. Now, all the newly built bridges and those that have been repaired and rebuilt have been replaced with iron bridges, in order to make it a permanent solution. (61)</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Watching a Movie</h3>
<p>— Yu Tang</p>
<p>It was the anniversary of the death of the Premier, and the weather was lovely. The car passed by a newly opened movie theater, and a huge half-mast flag was flying on the roof, making a loud noise in the wind. A large "Sold Out" sign was already hanging at the entrance, but people were still pouring in like a tide, revealing a contradiction that often made people feel both amused and sad. "O distressed people – don't hesitate, quickly find a comfortable seat. Watching a movie once in a while is not a heinous crime," I consoled myself and strolled into Nanjing.</p>
<p>The film was "Miracle of Love," starring Leon Baramu and Liu Yali Si, which tells the story of how a young doctor used heart medicine in addition to medicine to heal a woman's heartache. I don't want to describe the story in detail here, wasting space. Although I am satisfied with the acting skills of several leading actors, I can't write any film reviews because I am not an expert. On the one hand, because this film tells a story that is similar to my profession, I had two thoughts after watching it.</p>
<p>First, European and American films strive to be realistic when describing characters, places, and props of a particular profession. Places such as hospitals, train stations, post offices, and police stations, and all related characters and props, are not neglected even in the most minor details. In this regard, domestic films should admit that they are far behind. Leaving aside other things, take the hospitals that can often be seen in films. In the past, the hospital scenes in several domestic films were not only crude and simplified, failing to be realistic, but even the clothing and movements of the doctors and nurses inside, as well as the medical props, were full of errors. To the general public, perhaps as long as they see someone wearing a white coat, they think they are a doctor, and someone wearing a white hat, they think they are a nurse. And putting a few flasks and test tubes randomly, they think they are a laboratory, but in the eyes of experts, it is inevitable to find many inexcusable irrationalities. In order to improve the level of domestic films, I hope that directors will not be ashamed to ask questions and hire an expert in that profession for consultation when they encounter descriptions of places, characters, and props of a particular profession. Because a film is not only for thousands of people to watch, but also needs to be prepared to open up the foreign market, it should not be a laughing stock.</p>
<p>Second, what this film reveals to the audience is that a doctor should put diagnosis first and treatment second when seeing a patient. Before a definitive diagnosis is made for a disease, one should not make wild guesses or prescribe medicine indiscriminately to please the patient. Because most patients do not seek accurate diagnosis, but only seek prompt treatment. Like the intern in this film, because he was willing to focus on this point, he won the favor of a famous diagnostician. Although he offended the dean and lost the favor of the patient because of this, the expert was willing to pass on his life's skills to him alone, and said that even among a thousand doctors, it is difficult to cultivate a diagnostician. There are many people in the medical community who have seen this film, and hearing this should make many people feel ashamed.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Tidbits</h3>

<h3>Hollywood Movie News</h3>
<p>— Lu Degang</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen "If I Were King" and "The Private Life of Louis XIV" will probably never forget the superb acting skills of the leading actor, Colman. Colman will soon star in a historical film about the life of Lord Kitchener of England, a general who led the British army against a powerful enemy during the European War in 1914. The female lead has not yet been selected, because this is a pure action film, and the female lead's position is not very important.</p>
<p>Old comedian Charlie Chaplin is already fifty years old this year. His birthday is on April 2nd, and although the date is still far away, the gifts sent to him by movie fans from all over the world have already piled up like mountains. It is expected that his birthday celebration will be very lively!</p>
<p>Shirley Temple's new film "The Little Princess" is about to be completed. The production company has promised her a reward of US$100,000. Shirley plans to take a trip to England immediately after filming.</p>
<p>Hollywood has recently planned to shoot several detective films with the London Scotland Yard as the theme. In order to make them realistic, except for the unimportant interior scenes, which will be filmed in Hollywood, the rest will be filmed directly in England. It is expected that the required capital will be very large.</p>
<p>Little Fan Pengke will star in "The Three Musketeers" by French writer Alexandre Dumas. The actors must have the ability to jump and run. Playing such a role will surely give the audience great satisfaction.</p>

<h3>Liang Sisters Compete as Emperors and Empresses in Singapore for Advertising</h3>
<p>— (Ge)</p>
<p>After the Liang Saizhen and Saizhu sisters left Hong Kong to dance in Singapore, we received a report from a friend saying that the sisters' business is very prosperous, and the number of people who admire their cheongsams is increasing day by day. Recently, the New World Dance Hall, to which the two sisters belong, hosted an advertising costume dance competition. More than forty businesses participated, each represented by a dancer, wearing specially made costumes of the businesses they represented, holding a beauty contest and competing for the championship. The Liang sisters represented the Singapore Star Island Daily, wearing costumes with the demeanor of crowned emperors and empresses. Baozhen played the empress, wearing a crown made of the newspaper's star emblem, wearing a white brocade robe, with a red ribbon on her shoulder, with the words "Star Island Daily" in English inlaid with white gemstones. She was dignified and gorgeous, just like an empress. Because Baozhu had a masculine air, she dressed as an emperor, wearing an exquisite crown, wearing a purple imperial robe, with a red ribbon on her shoulder, with the words "Star Island Daily" in Chinese inlaid with white gemstones. She wore gold-painted leather shoes, looking like a Western supreme ruler. Behind the two of them, there were more than ten feet of tassels, inlaid with gold stars. At the end of the tassels, four Indian children, wearing military uniforms and white scarves, each with a gold star inserted on their heads, supported the emperor and empress's tassels. When the entire line was arranged, it was a grand sight. Before the competition started, the dance party continued as usual, with many guests. The Liang sisters had already absorbed the attention of all the dancers in the audience. After the competition, the Liang sisters sang a song each to entertain the guests, and there was a roar of cheers. The dancers were as if they were in a dream.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (120)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The "Chain of Plots" is a group performance in martial arts plays.</p>
<p>The Yellow family's miscalculation was not the end of the story. The imperial horse was never returned, and when the deadline arrived, the entire Tianba family was sentenced to be beheaded. Even if Tianba was lucky enough to defeat Dou Erdun, if he returned to the mountain and killed the imperial horse, fleeing far away and not fulfilling his promise to go to the capital to file a lawsuit, then the entire Tianba family would still not survive. Guangzu thought about it and devised a brilliant plan to steal the knife and the hook, making Dou Erdun voluntarily surrender due to his virtue and awe. He could not figure out how high Tianba's skills were, so he could peacefully resolve the situation and save the lives of the entire Tianba family. This shows his careful consideration, especially his courageous character. Tian Shuang was extremely fortunate to have such a good assistant. At the same time, it allowed people today to value the word "righteousness" more.</p>
<p>When Yang Xiaolou was in his prime, I saw him perform this play with Li Dezhong as Dou Erdun, and Wang Changlin as Zhu Guangzu. Both Li and Wang were versatile characters, and their singing, speaking, and acting were extremely skilled. There were several very good moves in "Stealing the Horse" and "Stealing the Hook." In his later years, Xiaolou used Jin Shaoshan and Hao Shouchen as Dou Erdun, and Wang Changlin taught Xiaoshan to play Zhu Guangzu. Although Jin and Hao had bright voices, one was too ethereal and the other was too fiery, and neither of them had a foundation in martial arts, so they were naturally not as good as Li's down-to-earth performance. Bian Shidengyang, who taught Xiaoshan, was an amateur who became a professional, but he did work very hard after joining Changlin's school and received Wang's true teachings. After Changlin passed away, he was considered the best martial arts clown, but unfortunately, he died of hemoptysis four years ago at the age of only fifty-something. Now, there are still people who can perform "Chain of Plots" in the semi-pure and two-row roles, but there is a real lack of talent for the opening and jumping roles. Wang Fushan is Wang Changlin's son, but his abilities are too mediocre, not as good as Ye Shengzhang in the north or Lu Qingyuan in the south. Ma Fulu had been working hard to practice martial arts a few years ago, and he could perform a few martial arts clown plays in the future, but he was not persistent. He was too fond of mahjong when there were no plays, which was also because he was too popular, too lazy, and had too much income, so he did not seek to improve. I really hope that he can do well and not be arrogant because of his popularity. He is likely to be the choice for a versatile civil and martial arts clown in the future.</p>

<h3>Securities Market for Public Bonds Expands; Prices See Rebound Yesterday</h3>
<p>The securities grey market saw an upward trend again yesterday, transforming the situation. Those who sold on the 20th the day before yesterday actually turned to buying yesterday. Only Dafeng &amp; Co. showed some activity on the bullish side, attracting some attention, but buyers still dominated. There was no significant news. The method for collecting cash is indeed a reality, but with some limitations. Most parties are unwilling to easily sell, resulting in a shortage of shares. Although market prices are bound to have some fluctuations, the upward trend may be unstoppable. The high prices of the previous days may easily be surpassed. In short, confidence is extremely strong, and the trend is more likely to rise than fall. The market scope is gradually expanding, and price fluctuations will naturally occur from time to time.</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading saw No. 5 and No. 35 buying in, and Lianhe &amp; Co. also absorbed a considerable amount. On the selling side, No. 38, Tongkang &amp; Co., and Dafeng &amp; Co. sold relatively little. Retail investors also sold more than they bought. Before noon, prices were slightly better by 2.5 to 5.5 jiao. In the afternoon, No. 20 and No. 40 saw a surge in buying, with No. 20 maintaining its consistent style. No. 40 shared the same view as No. 20. Others such as No. 7 and Mai Da also made purchases. Dafeng &amp; Co. still sold the most, and Fuda also sold a considerable amount. Retail investors still sold more than they bought, and because demand exceeded supply, prices continued to rise slowly but steadily. Series Wu broke through the 50 yuan barrier again, and prices improved by another 3 jiao. The final result was slightly better by 5.5 to 8.5 jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.1 million. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Bond Type  Highest  Lowest  Closing Price  Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 57.80  57.45  57.80  Up 0.60</p>

<h3>Finance Gold Prices Stable with a Weak Tone</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold grey market suddenly turned dull, lacking any excitement. The market hovered between 2,095 yuan and 2,098 yuan throughout the morning, mainly due to large investors watching. Although securities firms bought more than they sold in the middle, the market sentiment weakened due to the hard trend of foreign exchange, so cash dealers and some money exchange businesses successively sold, leading to a final weakening of the market price. However, in the afternoon, the securities firms suddenly wanted to buy back, but the buyers were scarce, so although the price was called down to the border of 2,090 yuan, it was still difficult to find a counterpart. As a result, the nominal drop was 2 yuan, but in reality, it fell by 8 yuan. The trading volume was not high throughout the day, about 500 taels in the morning, and nothing was done in the afternoon. Jewelry gold remained unchanged. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold consistently declined slightly.</p>
<h3>Spot Gold Only Slightly Down Two Yuan</h3>
<p>From the morning, each bar of ten taels had no trading activity at first. It was not until 9:45 that securities firms sold 30 taels to money exchange businesses at an opening price of 2,097 yuan, one yuan lower than the previous closing price. After opening, securities firms suddenly stopped selling and aggressively bought, taking in 50 taels from money exchange businesses at the same price of 97 yuan. Another 50 taels each were taken in from jewelry stores and cash dealers at 98 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank also took in 50 taels from cash dealers at the same price. Shortly after, the potential trend of foreign exchange reported a hardening, so the bank immediately resold 50 taels to jewelry stores at 97 yuan. Money exchange businesses said they sold 50 taels to securities firms at 95 yuan. Later, securities firms suddenly resold 50 taels to jewelry stores at 97 yuan. In a moment, they bought back 50 taels from money exchange businesses at 95 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses traded 50 taels among themselves at 96 yuan. By this time, it was already past 11:30. After this, supply and demand became scarce, and the price remained stagnant. It extended to noon without any trading activity, so the closing price at noon was still 96 yuan. Although foreign exchange was quite stagnant in the afternoon, the securities firms suddenly wanted to buy back, and the price was directly called down to 90 yuan for sale, but it was still difficult to find a counterpart, so no trading was done. However, a certain money exchange business had few ins and outs in the retail market, with only dozens of taels sold to local customers at 91 yuan. Based on the noon closing price of 2,096 yuan, the result was a nominal drop of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The selling price of cash dealers' own brand gold was 2,100 yuan, and the buying price was 2,085 yuan. The current margin gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading activity.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Gold Exchange Price Unchanged</h3>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged. Datong Hang still suspended at 213 yuan, and Xintong Hang was still at 211 yuan, buying in at 205 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pure Gold Down Half a Penny</h3>
<p>A London cable on the 13th stated that British pure gold shrank by half a penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 2 and a half pence. As a result, the Central Bank's Chinese cash buying price also dropped to 1,209 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold did not change, remaining at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also decreased by 4 jiao, reaching 1,205 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>British Gold Pound Demand Still Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate did not move. The foreign exchange market was relatively stable at first, but the demand then became scarce. Hong Kong cables were thrown out quite a bit, and Jardine Matheson and Sassoon &amp; Co. sold to make profits. Bank absorption was not smooth, and market prices tended to loosen. Afternoon trading was even scarcer, and the market was stagnant. Spot gold opened firm, but as foreign exchange loosened, gold dealers and money exchange businesses stopped in their tracks. Long positions were liquidated for profit, and the market tended to soften. In the afternoon, retail investors continued to sell, but buyers were very scarce, and it was difficult to find a counterpart. Trading was sparse, and the momentum was very weak. Foreign currency British gold pounds had strong demand, with wealthy people purchasing over 400 pieces. British-American gold notes were not actively absorbed, and trading was sparse. Various currencies slightly declined in small amounts. Association transactions were extremely rare, with only Chen Tai selling 500 US dollar notes for Huitong. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold notes rise by 5 fen, American gold pounds fall by 1 jiao, American dollar notes fall by 5 li, French francs fall by 5 hao, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Holds Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange drafts started high and returned at the end. Per 1,000 yuan, it once carried on the momentum from the previous day, reaching 51 yuan, but soon saw a return. At noon, it was 50 yuan and 2.5 jiao, and in the afternoon, it was 50 yuan, with no difference from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sassoon and Jardine Matheson Sold, Foreign Exchange Turned Looser Again</h3>
<p>Although "North China United Bank," Tianjin and Beijing speculators, and major foreign firms were buying in the foreign exchange market yesterday, Western banks were willing to supply, and Western firm Sassoon, Chinese firms, and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. started selling, leading to a slight loosening of potential. However, there were few changes in the middle, and trading turned quiet. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, supply and demand were evenly matched, with no difference.</p>
<p>At the start of the morning, the London big bar silver was unchanged in the near and far term, and the New York silver price also remained stagnant. London's raw gold shrank by half a penny, the British-American exchange rate was large at 9 hao, the British-French rate rose by 3 centimes, the British-Shanghai rate dropped by 0.0625, the American-British rate was still level, the American-French rate increased by 0.0625, and the American-Shanghai rate fell by 8 fen. The central listed rates for various exchanges remained the same. The banks' opening selling prices in the morning were 8 pence and 265625 for British exchange and 16 yuan and 15625 for American exchange, with no difference from the previous closing. After opening, foreign firms first came to settle with HSBC, Chartered Bank, and Banque Belge pour l'Étranger for British exchange at 8 pence and 25, and also for American exchange at 16 yuan and 125, showing a slight softening. The HSBC listing and the announcement of the silver equalization tax showed no increase or decrease. After this, although "North China United Bank" and Tianjin and Beijing speculators secretly bought in, Western firms Sassoon, Chinese firms, and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. vigorously sold, leading to a loosening of the downward trend. Sassoon, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and Chinese firms sold favorable British exchange to foreign banks at 8 pence and 265625, and American exchange at 16 yuan and 1875. Subsequently, Sassoon sold favorable British exchange to foreign banks at 8 pence and 296875. At that time, the American exchange rate also hardened to 16 yuan and 21875. Near noon, Chinese firms sold Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 55 yuan and a half, and the trend gradually flattened. The banks' selling prices at noon were 8 pence and 28125 for British exchange and 16 yuan and 1875 for American exchange.</p>
<p>The situation in the afternoon market was quiet, with only foreign firms settling with HSBC for British exchange at 8 pence and 28125. Later, a certain bank settled for American exchange with Banque Belge pour l'Étranger at 16 yuan and 1875, so the situation was quite stagnant. Extending to the late close, the banks' selling prices were 8 pence and 28125 for British exchange and 16 yuan and 1875 for American exchange. As a result, compared to the previous day, British exchange loosened by 0.015625, American exchange increased by 0.03125, and the Hong Kong exchange rate was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Indian Silver Weak, British Silver Level</h3>
<p>A London cable on the 13th stated that the silver market was quiet and stagnant. After closing, there were only a few purchases according to the listing. The big bar silver was unchanged in the near and far term. The New York silver and American silver prices remained stagnant. A Bombay cable stated that Indian silver was weak in the current term, with the spot price unchanged, and the near and far terms shrank by 3 annas.</p>
<h3>Grains Japonica and Indica Rice Hoarders Both Sell</h3>
<p>Market Prices Slightly Down Two or Three Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's source of rice, including the river and lower reaches, arrived on the 14th, with 6,000 to 7,000 packages transported by car. Since the overall situation turned lax, the arrival of rice yesterday was exuberant, and confidence grew weaker. Hoarders mostly launched sales, leading to a lower market, but there were many who took advantage of the low prices to pull in. However, the appetite was particularly harsh. As a result, the prices of both northern and southern japonica rice and thin rice all fell by two or three jiao. The decline in river and lower reaches rice was particularly severe, with a continued decline of four or five jiao. Except for Du Yangjian's scarce goods, which depreciated slightly by a jiao, the prices of port spikes also fell by two or three jiao due to the influence of guest spikes. Yuan hoarders also sold back, resulting in a cut of more than three jiao.</p>
<p>The guest indica rice market has entered the right track, with clear distinctions between high and low grades. Guest hoarders feared further losses and sought to sell, while actual sales were weak on both local and guest sides, and the market declined by two or three jiao. After the decline, the local demand for guest rice was still active, so the transaction volume was over 2,000 packages. Top-grade Nanjing indica rice only opened at 13.10 yuan, with large market Beijing indica and high Wu indica uniformly opening at 13 yuan, and mid-grade Wu indica already lowered to 12.12 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 3,300 packages of rice arrived from Hong Kong and were transferred to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Flour Domestic Sales Suddenly Rise</h3>
<p>Flour guest dealers' transactions had no special development, but scattered sales were still active. Northern gangs were restrained by foreign flour and did not make large purchases. Southern gangs also disliked the high prices, and transactions were not exuberant. However, yesterday, Changzhou and Wuxi in the inland suddenly came to Shanghai to purchase flour, because the local population gradually increased, and the demand was more complex, and confidence was also boosted a lot. The overall market was managed by northern and southern gangs and inland gangs, each handling 20,000 to 30,000 packages. Local retail sales were about 7,000 packages. No. 2 flour mill price was 4.70 yuan, and No. 3, No. 4 flour, and miscellaneous brands of flour were slightly different, and the market gradually became stable. Yesterday, 8,000 packages of exported flour were transported to Yantai, 7,000 packages to Tianjin, 3,000 packages from Hong Kong were transferred to Tianjin, and 5,000 packages were transferred to Yantai. Today, there are still 22,000 packages of flour and 2,000 bags of bran to be transported to Shantou.</p>
<p>In addition to a newly arrived ship of factory-set foreign wheat, the source of the wheat market still felt lacking. Because each producing area was controlled by a certain party, the source of whole tickets was almost hopeless. The sales channels of each factory have also invisibly stopped. Yesterday, it was heard that about one or two hundred packages were sent to the factory, priced at 6.80 yuan to 7 yuan. Due to the high grade of wheat, the selling price was slightly different. Transactions in the official market still had no single package traded.</p>
<h3>Yarn Cotton Yarn Production Seems Surplus, Multiple Parties Try Hard to Raise Prices: Ultimately Difficult to Sustain</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then weakened, and the trend still did not deviate from the hovering state, because actual demand was not smooth. The factory output greatly increased compared to before, because the newly created small-scale model factories had already started production, so based on the market situation, there was a daily feeling that supply exceeded demand. Although multiple parties tried their best to maintain and raise prices, they were ultimately difficult to stabilize, but the idea of general wealthy people absorbing was not cut off. There were many who came to pull in on a fall, and there were also many who spit out on a rise, so the force of rotation was extraordinarily tenuous. In the afternoon, buyers became active again, and the market image turned better again. This state can be said to be like this every day, with mornings being weak and the market returning to stability in the afternoon, with an increase of one or two yuan.</p>
<p>In the current yarn situation, the morning opening price carried on the strong momentum of the previous afternoon, and the market called out uniformly higher prices, with the opening price increasing by 5 jiao. The price of 20-count Tiannv was 395 yuan, but the opening price of Shuangma was the same as the previous day. After a short time, a certain party came to sell again. At the same time, the guest dealers' business was not exuberant, and the market price suddenly tended to decline, decreasing step by step. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 391 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was done at 388 yuan, a drop of 3.5 yuan compared to the opening price. Then, taking advantage of the low price, buyers came in again, and it rebounded slightly. By the closing price, Shuangma was 392 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 389 yuan. In the afternoon, inland gangs had some needs, but when buying yarn from Zhenhua Factory, multiple parties came to take action, and the market state was slightly higher. It remains to be seen what will happen tomorrow morning, and then the actual demand will be used as the basis for advancement and retreat. The statistics of the total purchase volume of various gangs throughout the day were 2,060 packages, and the market price of 20-count Shuangma fell by one yuan compared to the previous day. Other yarn markets also showed weakness. Zhenhua Factory opened 160 packages of 16-count Shuanglong at 315 yuan, and 150 packages of 12-count Shuanglong at 312 yuan smoothly. Yesterday, 60 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Yantai, 290 pieces to Tianjin, and today there are still 250 pieces to be transported to Shantou and 60 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of transactions for each gang is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Same Trade 1,305  Shantou 10</p>
<p>Inland 370  Xiamen 15</p>
<p>Sichuan 60  Hong Kong 60</p>
<p>Wenzhou 140  Tianjin 50</p>
<p>Jiangxi 20  Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Yunnan 20  Total 2,060</p>
<p>The opening of the Japanese yarn market once saw a tense situation, jumping four or five yuan. It was said that the northern Tianjin gang had business, and confidence was strong. Then, long positions emerged, and it fell back again. As a result, it still rose by more than 2.3 yuan. The current yarn price for 20-count Suigetsu was 336 yuan, and the current yarn price for 20-count Blue Phoenix was around 329 yuan.</p>
<h3>Machine-Ginned Cotton Breaks Through the 70 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>The local cotton business remained as dull as ever. The factory side had absolutely no action, because the goods were scarce, and the called price was particularly high, and it was rising step by step. New peaks emerged one after another. Machine-ginned cotton broke through the 70 yuan barrier again, reaching 70.075 yuan. Tongzhou cotton was still the same high price as the previous day. There was no source from northern Jiangsu. 3,600 packages of Yao cotton arrived. The current cotton trading is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Tong Cotton 77.20 Yuan Xingde 600 Packages  Exchange</p>
<p>Dezi 89.00 Same Trade 200 Pieces  Again</p>
<p>Machine-Ginned 70.75 Again 200 Packages  Cash</p>
<p>Changyin 79.25 Again 500 Packages  Exchange</p>
<p>The market price of foreign cotton: New York opened in the morning and rose by one to three points. In the middle, it weakened due to the lack of new developments in agricultural legislation in Washington. Later, due to overseas cotton merchants purchasing and short covering, it closed at the highest price. As a result, it rose by two to eight points. The Indian cotton market was quite firm. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose by another rupee. Yesterday, Indian cotton stopped trading for a day due to the death of a broker. However, according to the telegram received from Mahaqiang in the evening of the previous day, the white broach for April and May was 157 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by ten points. Yesterday, the exchange rate tightened, and the converted legal tender cotton prices all rose. American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 9 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by 4 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 8 jiao.</p>
<p>The Shanghai market for foreign cotton trading was extraordinarily quiet. Neither Chinese nor foreign factories had any transactions. Because yarn prices were depressed and the current transport of Indian cotton was difficult, they temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The cotton prices for yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>Raw Materials Category  Delivery to Factory Including Tax</p>
<p>60-Count Egyptian Cotton High Grade 12.30</p>
<p>Again Again Medium Grade 108.40</p>

<h3>Sugar Market Taikoo Crystal White Opens at 4,200 Bags, Negotiations for Green Raw Sugar Gradually Approaching</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The association's planned market for No. 24 Dutch coarse white was quoted at the original price, and the transshipped goods fell by 1.5 jiao, with more than 400 bags transacted at 16.5 yuan. Dutch red cargo was at 16.75 yuan, with dozens of bags planned out. The Taikoo crystal white market trend was more firm. Grade B cargo was still planned at 24.7 jiao, and futures rose by 5 fen, opening at 4,200 bags, with the price for immediate shipment at HK$9.45, and April at 9.55. The price negotiations for national sugar green raw sugar were gradually approaching, and hundreds of bags should be able to open today. More than a hundred bags of ordinary Shimen sliced green sugar opened at 11.8 jiao. The Jinan ship arrived with 700 pieces of Taikoo sugar, 583 bags of green sugar, and 160 bags of red sugar. Another 1,500 bags came from Holland.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Beans Unanimously Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both future and spot yellow beans showed a soft trend. Due to seasonal factors, Du beans and sand yellow beans had weak arrivals and sales. Large-volume trading usually relied on car beans, but in this environment, they inevitably approached Lien beans. However, recently, the sales channel was slack and the market trend softened, so Lien beans were restrained. It is estimated that seven cars of Dalian beans will be delivered in April, priced at 8.30 yuan, a decrease of 2 fen compared to the previous market. On the spot market, the Guang gang purchased 500 packages of Chongming sand yellow beans at 8.50 yuan to 8.35 yuan, 70 packages of Pinghu medium-grain Du beans at 9.65 yuan, and one car of Dalian spot beans at 8.40 yuan. Yesterday, 11 tons of beans were transported to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes Spot Soybean Oil Rises Another 4 Jiao</h3>
<p>Futures Cake Foreign Firm's Intention to Dump is Strong</p>
<p>The oil market still did not escape the rotation, and peanut oil was tight after first being flat due to unsettled confidence. 50 pieces of open warehouse oil were opened, with the price at the original market price of 29.2 jiao. 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 29 yuan and 30 yuan. Soybean oil had few arrivals and continued sales. Spot oil rose by 4 jiao, and futures oil turned up by two or three jiao under the addition of speculators. The overall market estimated the opening of 200 loads of spot oil from this factory, 100 pieces of Yanqi, 100 pieces of big and small baskets of Lianqi, 300 barrels of Dalian spot oil, 500 barrels of March futures oil, 100 barrels of March next, 1,300 or 400 barrels of April futures oil, and 50 barrels of 500 shares. Spot cake Ningbo gang bought 300 pieces of Dayou Wang brand cake, priced at 3.26 yuan, a rise of 2 fen. 1,000 pieces of inland Jiangbei small cake, the market was loose because the goods were abundant and the cargo holders were loose to sell, opening at the original market price of 6.1 fen. Dalian April and May futures cakes, the foreign firm's intention to dump was strong, and the hoarders took the opportunity to kill and enter, and the market fell by four or five fen compared to the previous market, opening 24,000 pieces at 3.15 yuan to 3.20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Fine Cloth Expensive</h3>
<p>Coarse Cloth Steady</p>
<p>National cloth white goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and products from the Yong'an, Shenxin, and Xinyu factories, continued to have good demand from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi gang. The cheap and quick-handed goods on the market were gradually sold out. The factory market price of Shenxin Fugui fine cloth was 13 yuan, and fine twill was 12 yuan, insisting on not loosening, so the price of quick-handed goods was also sold tighter and tighter. Yesterday, the market price of fine cloth was 12.75 yuan to 12.9 jiao, and fine twill was 11.85 yuan to 9 jiao, with more than 200 pieces purchased by the bank gang and the Yongshaoou gang. Yong'an Dapeng fine cloth had a stock shortage, and few transactions were made. The sub-brand Red Dapeng sold at 13 yuan, a rise of 2 jiao compared to the previous market. The market price of Fugui fine cloth and fine twill rose by 1 jiao per piece in the later market. However, the products from the Tianjin Hengyuan Factory and various single-weaving factories had no increase or decrease in the selling price. Transactions of coarse cloth were light, and prices were flat. The selling price of bleached and dyed cloth had few changes. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi gang had a more complex need, and 300 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached material, poplin, foreign yarn, and colored cloth were transacted.</p>
<p>Dong cloth white goods rose in the morning and weakened in the afternoon, and the market trend has shown a turning point. The highest market price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth sold over 11.85 yuan per piece, and then returned to 11.8 yuan, Caiqiu 12 yuan, and Feiyu 11.9 yuan. The Tianjin gang entered more than 400 packages of fine cloth. The Qingdao gang entered a total of three or four hundred pieces in the past two days. The sale of dyed blanks on this street was still strong, and another 700 pieces were entered. Dongmian Foreign Firm opened 200 pieces of Longtou fine cloth for the next month, with the price at 11.95 yuan per piece. Ito ordered more than a hundred pieces of Feiyu fine cloth, with the price at 12.05 yuan per piece, which was also for April futures.

<p>Yesterday, 110 pieces of piece goods were exported to Yantai, and 175 pieces to Tianjin. Today, there are another 45 pieces to be transported to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea The Decline in Raw Silk Prices Comes to an End</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Market's Confidence Gradually Stabilizes</p>
<p>The overseas silk market has seen a sharp decline in Japanese silk prices over the past two weeks. Spot silk prices have plummeted from 1,055 yuan directly to the 1,000 yuan mark, reaching 960 yuan (recorded in the morning market on March 11). This has had a significant impact on the American, French, and local markets, resulting in a situation where there were offers but no buyers. As of yesterday, silk prices in various ports gradually showed signs of stabilization, and it appears that the price decline has come to an end. Yesterday, Yokohama spot prices rebounded by 15 yuan, and forward prices rose by 9 yuan. New York spot prices opened at original levels for near-term contracts, while forward contracts rose by 2 cents. Most other Chinese and Japanese spot silk prices remained stable, with only Lyon showing continued weakness. Japanese silk prices fell by 3.5%, Shanghai silk A grade fell by 2.5%, and B grade fell by 2%.</p>
<p>The lowest price for Shanghai's White Factory B grade silk briefly returned to 1,720 yuan, but due to scattered transactions, it was difficult to record. Yesterday, confidence gradually stabilized. Although foreign and domestic sales are still not active, silk prices are already rising. British and French firms have made some inquiries, but few transactions have been concluded. The New York Shanghai silk price is still opening at $2.14, which is still about 100 yuan away from the Shanghai price. Yesterday, 30 bales of Indian silk were traded, with firm prices. No domestic sales were reported. Yesterday, 179 bales of Hu silk were shipped to Europe, and 11 tons of Japanese tea were shipped to London.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports Significant Imports of Dutch Goods from Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 35,880 packages of beeswax, 3,000 packages of tapioca starch, 1,010 pieces of coconut oil (soap-making raw material), 1,420 pieces of teak planks, 650 boxes of rubber, 1,250 pieces of hide, and 116 barrels of kerosene were imported from the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<h3>Metals The Rising Trend of "Hui Si" Iron Has Not Weakened</h3>
<p>Since the overseas price of 200-pound American "Hui Si" iron soared, buyers in the local market have been very crowded. The standard price has risen sharply, with old steel mills quoting 57 yuan per case and new steel mills selling for 56 yuan, both 1 yuan higher than the previous market. Recently, due to strong buying interest, even as overseas prices have softened, the rising trend has not weakened. Yesterday, there were transactions from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other regions. Local factories also made some sales, offering more than 500 cases. The market price in the local area was between 57 yuan and 57.67 yuan, while buyers from other regions were still offering 56.7 yuan. According to overseas prices, the recent price per case is 7.23 gold yuan, about 0.278 yuan lower than the previous price. It is rumored that some industry players have made deals, but only for a hundred tons or so.</p>
<h3>The Transformations of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Hui (Continued)</p>
<p>(5) Transfers of Ownership</p>
<p>Transfers of ownership in industry and commerce mostly occur when businesses are unable to sustain themselves or are unwilling to continue operating, while simultaneously, newcomers are interested and willing to take over. The result is the transfer of ownership. What distinguishes this from liquidation is that there is a successor, so the transfer of ownership is also a significant transformation in industry and commerce. Over the past year, there have been 873 such transfers of industrial and commercial firms. Of these, only 131 were factories, while 742 were commercial firms. Among the 873 transferred industrial and commercial firms, the food and beverage industry accounted for the most, with 298 firms. This is likely due to the abnormal development of consumer industries after becoming an isolated island! The next largest categories were clothing (117 firms) and daily necessities (116 firms). After becoming an isolated island, people from various regions considered it a haven, and the population grew continuously as a result, expanding compared to pre-war levels. Naturally, the demand for clothing and daily necessities was urgent, and these two industries thrived accordingly. Undoubtedly, the variations also increased. Next were the fuel and hygiene industries, each with 47 firms; metal and electrical, 43 firms; travel, 27 firms; medicine, 25 firms; culture, 22 firms; entertainment, 18 firms; transportation, 15 firms; decoration, 13 firms; construction, 10 firms; finance and public utilities, each with 5 firms; special industries, 2 firms; and 63 firms with unspecified industries.</p>
<p>Comparing the number of transfers of 873 industrial and commercial firms across different months, March had the highest number with 92 firms, followed by September with 86 firms, October with 80 firms, April and May each with 78 firms, June with 77 firms, December with 75 firms, November with 74 firms, July with 67 firms, June with 59 firms, August with 56 firms, and January at the bottom with 51 firms. This shows that the number of changes in each month follows the commercial season. A table listing the number of firms by industry for each month is shown below:</p>
