<p>社評</p>
<h3>美日與中日</h3>
<p>美日兩國其將戰乎？</p>
<p>中日兩國其可和乎？</p>
<p>此二問者，不論答案之其然其吾，要皆有關當前之國際，影響今後之世界，蓋莫大之問題也。竊願試求解答。解答之前，應先列例外二端：（一）歐亞二洲現行之戰爭，若延擴而為世界大戰，美日兩國皆入漩渦，則兩國間之狀態，其性質上非復兩國事而為世界事；（二）中日兩國現行戰爭若為國際所支配而非兩國所得自主，則兩國間之狀態，根本上為之變質，非居今日而得以常情常理相衡量；此二例外者，請擯之今日論列範圍之外。</p>
<p>據隔昨東京電稱：「美日關係此後將轉入佳境，或更趨惡劣，將於下週中有所決定；」此言本星期為重要發展之時期，顧轉佳趨惡為未卜耳。據昨日東京電稱：「美日談判即將開始之前夕，日本報章對美採取仇視及挑釁態度；」又稱「野村外相報告內閣，美日改善關係，希望甚微；」又稱都新聞社論謂美日倘發生戰事，日本深信必獲勝利，故在美國虛張聲勢之下，日本斷不讓步，倘美國以過度壓力加諸日本時，其嚴重結果惟上帝知之。至於美國方面，既於去年杪，以嚴峻之牒文送達日本政府；復於本月二十日，由駐日大使格魯氏，以率直之演說，警吿日本朝野；此見於意思表示者也。七月杪，宣告廢止美日商的，期以半載，再閱三月而至明年一月底，商的失效；最近兩月，美國在遠東與太平洋，儘量强化軍備；明年春，將在太平洋作空前大規模之海軍演習；此見於實際行動者也。而格魯大使復融會貫通美國所言所行而切實宣稱「渠實代表並傳達美國朝野之一般感想，美國對於遠東近來發展之輿情，幾成一致：其所根據者為事實而非宣傳，此種全國一致之輿情，乃美政府不能稍加忽視之力量，終必在其政策上與行動上見之」。綜觀美日兩方之情况，宜如日本野村外相所作「美日關係惡化」之推論矣。然則其將戰乎？</p>
<p>中日戰爭由於日本侵略，故日本主動而中國實為被動：今後或續戰，或謀和，亦繫於主動之日本；此中關鍵，本報既再三闡明之矣。今者，日本方面不僅由文士論家，向中國申述其和平之願望；即彼政治軍事之各級當局，亦昌言於「中國事變將近結束」，而其直接間接之宣傳，復以中國國民政府求和，某某國家從中勸和云云，為促進和平空氣之襯托。夫和戰關鍵在彼，而彼方意念若此，然則其可和乎？</p>
<p>於此二問，我人殊無自而作正面之答案：質言之；美日決不戰，中日尙難和。蓋以美日而論：將由美國先向日本開砲乎？將由日本先向美國開砲乎？此皆不可思議之現象。美國以和平立國，崇尙正義，擁有舉世無匹之實力；其政策，其行動，足以貫澈主張，膺懲强暴者，方式至多，斷乎無須開砲，必可獲致與開砲同等之效力。不惟同等，祗須暫時犧牲一部份之貿易，自商業與金融上實行封鎖，此其結果，較諸開砲，不但效力相同，抑且兼備數長：就物質言，封鎖較開砲為經濟；就時間言，封鎖較戰勝為便捷；就方法言，封鎖較流血為人道；就應付中之一般情形言，封鎖較軍事行動為安全。故美國決不對日作戰。日本者，其國際之基本政策，事大者也；其人民之幼稚意識，自大者也。惟事大，故歷史上從未與較强之國相抗爭；日俄戰時，俄較日强，而日本事得大英，始與俄戰；日德戰時，德較日强，而日本知協商諸國之大，始與德戰；更觀於張鼓峯對蘇聯屈服，謂將在太平洋對美國戰爭？美日國勢相差遠甚，故日本決不對美作戰。惟彼自大，故民間猶有戰必勝美之報上空談；故對華侵略自陷泥淖之中，既無以為繼，復切謀息戰，而彼朝野聞人之所以詔示其自大之人民者，皆出以對華「加恩推惠」之口吻。夫中國之於和議，必以平等為絕對前提，不平等，和不成，亦決不和；此乃中國絕對一致之國論，亦國際最合理之原則。然在日本國內，迄今絕未形成「中日平等」之輿情；日本國內若無中日平等之普遍輿情，則日本當局決不敢以平等之精神與形式，與中國議和。更以現代政治推論之，日本未見中日平等之普遍輿情之日，決難產生理解平等，誠信平等，尊重平等，力求平等之當局。此一樞紐，深望中日有志謀和者澈底體認明白；是在今日，樞紐渺然，故曰中日尙難和。</p>
<p>美日與中日似是兩問題，而二者息息相關；其實非兩問題，乃為一問題之兩面，日本則為問題之中心。日本對美國，或有欲戰之氣憤，絕無開戰之氣魄與力量；近日雖由人工製造反美空氣，然於其嘗試之後，即可發見此種空氣不足以變更美國堅定之政策，喝退美國整備之行動，則反美空氣行見其將如曇花一現而已，此後關鍵，我人以為決非如東京電所傳之「下週中有所決定」；竊以為實繫於下列兩種時間空間之比較；即日本國內先造成中日平等之普遍輿情，然後作合理之循序推進，俾得議和乎？抑美國之政策行動，以時勢之推移，而先見諸事實，以為安定遠東之動力乎？</p>

<h3>冀省水災之嚴重</h3>
<p>日方期望至高之棉花已全毀　災區千萬民衆勢將盡成餓殍</p>
<p>字林報十月十八日北平通信云、關於天津因本年洪水而受之巨大損失與痛苦、所聞頗多、惟冀省其餘部份受此洪水影響之消息、則所見甚少、一般人或不明瞭今有將近</p>
<p>一千萬人</p>
<p>將成餓殍也、天津積水、已用抽水機抽盡、但冀省中部與南部之廣大地域、仍屬一片在洋、許多城鎭與村落、確實仍淹水中、其結果之一、乃為此等區域中之軍事行動完全停止、日駐軍因難以保持暢達之交通、多已撤退、而華方游擊隊之食物供給、亦感缺乏、不幸之民衆、受戰事危險之餘、今且勢必成餓殍、據近自津浦路來客談、鐵路綫以西鄉野、極目所見者、類</p>
<p>似大湖沼</p>
<p>偶有地面較高村落之房屋、猶在水面、若海中島嶼然、秋季之穀類、以及日方期望至高之著名棉花、均已全毀、冀南民衆、以樹木根葉充飢、以延殘喘、災象已成矣、據美敎會在保定東南若干區域作</p>
<p>統計調查</p>
<p>蠡縣於七月十二日堤決被淹、整區約五分之一土地、仍成澤國、該縣二百二十四個村落中、二百個仍淹水中、秋收蚤吿絕望、流離失所者的一萬五千人、高陽於同日被淹、該區村落一百個、現已無水者僅四十個、無家可歸者八千人、據獻縣敎會消息該區三百八十個村落中之居民、糧食斷絕、若以最低廉之穀類供給彼等、每日須費五萬七千元、由此可</p>
<p>災况重大</p>
<p>之一斑、今鄕野大窺見部份仍為水淹、當然不能種植冬麥、故縱於來春、不幸之鄉民、亦無脫離災荒之望、再、華北之洩水系統至劣、苟非竭力用特殊方法洩去積水、並開濬天津河口、則地面積水、未必能在明年夏季降雨之前退盡、故另一季之收成、亦將無望、而災荒至少</p>
<p>將歷兩載</p>
<p>也、迄今為止、似未曾採行應付此巨災之一般辦法、天津近郊、已得撥款數萬元、採辦食物、分散貧苦、然僅杯水輿薪、無濟於事耳、冀中少數區域內、各村男子、服强迫勞役、照當時控制該地之當局者意見、而修理道路、或毀路而建灌水溝渠、亦有擬定築堤造路之計劃者、但未實行、當局為種種原因、不准穀類自未受洪水影響之區、運往饑荒堪虞之各區、聞日軍當局、因洪水迫使冀省游擊隊他去、故並不純視洪水為災禍、</p>

<p>（七）充實設備及敎材　無論保育院·敎養院·慈幼院、大都因陋就簡、這在國難期中、應有的精神表現、但兒童是國家未來的主人翁、我們對自身應刻苦節省、對兒童不能太計算小錢、最低限度、兒童的生活、要給予簡單·樸素·衣煖·吃飽·住適·玩暢·如果一個小祠堂裏、擠滿四五百兒童、所有房屋、祗够全作兒童的宿舍、雖是可以捲起舖蓋作敎室、這種情形、究竟不能久持下去、再加紙張缺乏、敎本沒有、憑着敎師的本事、天天講些故事和時事、唱些「我的家在松花江上……』一類的救亡歌曲、走些普通操的步伐、出外對老百姓作些抗敵的宜傳、兒童一天一天的畏大起來、轉瞬抗戰結束、究竟培植人才、是吾適合敎養的代價、大家還不暇顧到這層關係、從前人家對子女敎育很重視、無論如何貧困、雖典質衣服、必送子女進優良學校、出重費入學、亦所不計、所以我們辦理難童敎育、也得有這個眼光、應該從別方面浪費行政上、設法省錢、來充實各院的設備、並目從速充實教材、使難童滿足知識的營養、</p>

<h3>法國戰爭經濟力及其運用</h3>
<p>— 紉英</p>
<p>法國之弱點</p>
<p>人的資源不足，為法國戰爭能力弱點之一。對於戰爭最有用之成年男子，亦較一般國家為少。無論法國政府當局，為補救此種弱點計，努力講求人口政策：如去年七月中迭連頒發全國民之生育貼補，扶育津貼，主婦津貼之增加，防止各地靑年之集中都市，婚姻撮合之利便，改善私生子之待遇等等法令，然對於今日可能動員之男子數，則尙未能有何影響可得。</p>
<p>列强成年男子之構成（單位千人）調查年　總人口　一五—四九歲（）佔男</p>
<p>份　數　男子（）子總數％</p>
<p>法國　一九三六　四一·三〇〇　九·八七〇　四九·六</p>
<p>英國　一九三七　四六·〇〇八　一一·八七二　五三·七</p>
<p>美國　一九三五　一二七·三四一　三四·三九八　五三·六</p>
<p>德國　一九三八　七四·八二七　一九·六四五　五三·九</p>
<p>意國　一九三六　四二·九一八　一〇·三七八　四八·八</p>
<p>蘇聯　一九三六　一四七·〇二八　三四·九三七　四九·二</p>
<p>日本　一九三五　六九·二五四　一六·八八九　四八·六</p>
<p>（備考）根據一九三八——三九年國聯年鑑，蘇聯係依國勢調查。</p>
<p>如右表所示：十五歲至四十九歲之男子數，法國僅九百八十七萬人，為各國中最少者。是以可充常備兵力者，由歐戰時出世之二十歲至二十四歲之男子，法國僅一百五十二萬人，英國有四百二十三萬人；而德國將捷典合計後可得五百十五萬人。是以英法合力之結果，亦僅較德國略優耳。</p>
<p>殖民地之依存程度</p>
<p>法國對於殖民地之重要，不僅在於人員資源之補充，抑且在於物質資源之補充。故其關係，至為鉅大。</p>
<p>近年法國對殖民地依存性如下表：</p>
<p>法國對殖民地之依存率（％）</p>
<p>一九三五　一九三七　一九三八</p>
<p>民地佔本國輸入總額　二五·八　二四·四　二七·一</p>
<p>國輸出總額對殖民地　三一·五　二八·三　二七·四</p>
<p>民地佔本國貿易總額　二八·二　二七·二　二七·二</p>
<p>在殖民地中，以北非洲之地位尤為重要，幾佔殖民地貿易總額的五分之三；其中允以阿耳及里亞之關係允為深切。</p>
<p>就貿易品言：一九三八年度殖民地之輸出本國者，食料佔本國食料總輸入的七三·六％，反之，本國之食料輸出中，輸往殖民地者僅佔三三·七％，而六六·三％則皆係輸往其他國家者。</p>
<p>至於原料之輸出，法國原料貿易總額中，對非殖民地者佔至八八·七％，對殖民地者僅佔一一·三％，與上述情形則有所不同。</p>
<p>完成品之輸出總額中，對殖民地者則佔三五·四％，而其輸入則僅佔二·八％耳。</p>
<p>換言之：佔法國輸入大宗之原料品，大都來自外國。次為食料品，則大多來自殖民地，故殖民地實為法國糧食之供給地。</p>
<p>法國食料自給率號稱八三％，由殖民地輸入後可得一〇〇％之自給自足，故在今决戰爭中定必努力為之！</p>
<p>殖民地與工業原料</p>
<p>由殖民地輸入工業原料及其開發，不及食料品等容易。如印度支那之東京的無烟煤，品質確極優秀；但因運費昂貴，故素來不過輸人一萬七千噸耳。今後因德波煤之輸入停止，其勢只得冒海運之危險而將盡量利用之。</p>
<p>印度支那橡皮之生產力，昨年的五萬九千噸；如經開發，則三年後可增至十萬噸。法國平時之橡皮，雖足以自給；但戰時因需要激增，勢必不足。</p>
<p>北非洲之摩洛哥，阿耳及里亞，喬其亞所產之燐酸鹽，年達四百萬噸。在一九三八年份，不獨對本國輸出七十六萬一千噸；目對英，德，意，荷，比諸國亦輸出一百八十三萬三千噸。</p>
<p>北非各地尙盛產鉛，鋅，鐵鑛，錳，鈷等重要物資；但無石油，則為一大缺憾！</p>
<p>兀尼亞，西非洲，皆產金。而以兀尼亞之金鑛允為著名。其埋藏量推定達四千億法郞。惟因氣候，交通，以及人力不足等等影響，採擴至為困難。</p>
<p>棉花之增產計劃，目前正在兀尼亞之拿額河下游的特而達地方努力進行中，利用當地水力耕耘八十萬黑克得土地，足以供給法國本國棉花需要總額的三分一。此項計劃，預定一九四一年完成。昨年法國之棉花輸入總額二十億法郞，來自殖民地者佔三五％；成就猶遠。故開發殖民地與利用其原料之效極微。</p>
<p>戰爭實行力之關鍵</p>
<p>現代戰爭之原料消費，誠如下列表所舉者之鉅大。故法國進行長期戰爭之困難，實即在於獲得原料之困難。</p>
<p>不同類型之戰爭的原料消費額（千噸）</p>
<p>（備考）根據飽索尼著「將來戰爭」一書內所估計之數字，此係指戰錢延長一千啟羅，作戰期間一年，所需之原料的消費額，一九三八年度之生產額，係根據國聯年鑑一九三八—三九年版。</p>
<p>如就原料自給率言：即將殖民地併計，亦不及德國之豐足。因此法國將一方維持本國對殖民地之交通綫，而由殖民地方面獲取原料。同時提高戰時輸出力，而由英美方面輸入其所需。惟在人力資源不足之下，加以在實行向西格斐防綫作全面進攻時又需巨大之勢力；困難未易解決，職是之故，不得不取海上封鎖之戰衡，以待德國淪於疲蔽時期。雖然：原料消費量增大之壓勢，依然不能因此而稍减。故實行法國戰爭經濟之關鍵，將在於充分，使國內軍需生產力之高度化，以及為獲致原料而須配備對外軍需之能力的如何？（下期續完）</p>

<h3>印美棉合法幣</h3>
<p>— 三</p>
<p>近來有很多讀者，欲明瞭美棉及印棉折合國幣之計算法，特將此二種棉價之計算方法，作一簡略說明。</p>
<p>按照普通商業習慣，棉業界今仍遺用司馬秤老擔，習慣上如是，故下面的折合亦以司馬秤計算，茲簡述如下：</p>
<p>（一）美棉計算法美棉價格，其計數是以磅為單位，例如十月二十六日紐的交易七月份行市為八六一，這就是七月份美棉每磅價値為美金八分六厘一毫，茲將美棉磅的單位，來凑成司馬秤的擔，則以一三三乘之，換言之，以一百三十三磅之美棉，正等於司馬秤的擔價。同時再以當日之滬美滙兌除之，如此即可得美棉合司馬秤每擔法幣之價格：</p>
<p>（二）印棉計算法　印棉的單位為Candy「康迪」，每一「康迪」計重七百八十四磅，以司馬秤折合，則等於老擔五百八十八斤，茲以十月二十六日印度孟買棉花交易所行市，四五月份白洛區每「康迪」為一百九十六又七五羅比，以昨日滬印滙兌每百元合二十七又半羅比計算，合成每擔為法幣一百二十一元六角七分，茲將算法列後</p>
<p>上列之計算法，異常簡明，惟有一點應請讀者特別注意者，卽此種價格，是僅將當天之交易所行市，以滙兌折合而成，如若裝運來，則尙需加上各種棉之等級之差數，運費，兵險，及關稅利息等費。</p>
<p>徵求答案</p>
<p>自恒源泰花號張方仁先生提出外棉折價問題後，記者就所知者計算後亦起疑問。已詳上期本刊。嗣求敎於中棉，蒙介紹胡君此文：深為感幸。惟由此算式折合市擔之價，與由美棉價直接折合市擔之價及司馬擔之價，彼此仍有二三元之差。茲根據上文，將各項計算結果列下，希碩彥敎之。</p>
<p>由美棉直接折合司馬一擔之價（見前式）</p>
<p>由司馬一擔之便轉折市秤一擔之價</p>
<p>由美棉直接折合市秤一擔之價（參看上期本刊）</p>
<p>由市秤價轉合司馬一擔價</p>
<p>英棉折價</p>
<p>富華彭伯嘉先生：來函奉悉。美棉價即利物浦棉花交易所之行情。與美棉米得林標準同。呌價單位亦為磅，惟按英幣便士計算。故折算法照美棉者同：惟不用美滙而用英滙耳。美棉折價問題尙無定論</p>
<h3>過去一週</h3>
<p>財部發新條例，禁止銀行錢莊以黃金為借款抵押品，並禁止當鋪收當黃金，這種統制私人所有黃金的政策，在國家立塲上講，是絕對需要的。就國民本身說，出售於政府，所損失的僅屬若干不義之財，况盡力輸財，乃是義不容辭的，法幣原與金銀價脫離干係；可是在投機者活動的外匯黑市塲上，却仍是現金黑市相互影響的。所以進出現金黑市與進出外滙黑市並無不同。現金沸漲促成黑牌外匯下降，因此由金價上漲賺到的錢，暗中被外滙下降消磨完了，甚至還有無形貼水的危險，購金朋友如果理會此中因果，那末顯以出售於政府為有利了（一粟）</p>
<p>過去米價昂貴，由於供（來源）求（囤戶）雙方操縱，現在各地均吿豐收，新米源源登場，米價已見鬆動。在這時候，第一特區市民聯會三個分會建議租界當局，設置公會，實行儲積，正是再確當也沒有了。因為設倉儲糧，旣可防止囤戶的操縱；又可有備無患。最近川省大吿豐收，農本局乃造具叫川新穀購儲計劃，分為兩部：一為辦理運銷，一為專辦囤儲，後者便是設倉儲糧的明證。上海目前雖因環境特殊：然各米號如果能與當局切實合作，設倉儲糧便輕而易舉的。若以設置公倉在時間與經濟方面，容有未便，不妨租用現成的倉庫棧房。（嘉禾）</p>
<p>外匯黑市在節節放長，這並不是中國當局重來維持上海滙市而逐漸上升以達到新水準再固定之。而是由於外商為了自己的貿易，湘戰與歐戰嚇碎了多頭的心，日偽搜刮土產需要法幣，華僑資金流回祖國，外滙本身信用動搖，法幣價値比黑市塲過高等等，以致市塲本身有自行調整之必要，同時一般大投機家目見扒吸勢將沒路，故傾售外滙，變成供過於求因而鬆弛了。不過應當「謹愼入彀」，因為大投機家常會使用「欲擒故縱」之類的惡技，使小投機家相繼脫售，到了外滙放長至相當程度時，再來一套搜購活動。各位若不迅速「改弦易轍」，投資生產事業；那末總免不了遭遇受人家操縱的惡運的。（方挹芳）</p>

<p>關於越界築路糾紛、自甘三日晚工部局總董樊克令與偽市長傳筱庵會商後、工部局方面、即由要員商討一「建議綱領」、並依據該項綱領起草「具體辦法」、作爲解決工部局與偽市府間爭執之基礎、俾雙方從而討論、「建議綱領」決定後、會由樊克令於甘六日晚二度會晤傳俊庵時提出、惟聞傳對之不能同意、至工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥暨該局警務處總監鮑恩起草之「具體辦法」、昨據大中社記者探悉、亦已起草竣事、且盛傳有提付工部局董事會討論後、始行書面送達傳筱庵者、</p>
<p>局方定期　召集會議</p>
<p>茲悉工部局董事會、巳定本星期三（十一月一日）下午四時三十分舉行、惟是吾討論該案、據工部局某董事稱截止咋日、工部局並未通知議程中列有該案、或爲會外接洽、亦未可知、大中社記者曾詢某董事、會議接洽、是吾可認爲董事會討論、某董事表示、祇須得總董事前之同意、與各董事之諒解、亦得成立云云、故截止昨晚、尙無確實消息、又據新聲社消息、工部局秘書裘勃於一十八日語記者、工部局定十一月一日下午四時三十分舉行董事會議、屆時對「建議方案」及越界築路一般問題、歸納意見、作重要之討論、至於滬西界外區域之若干「建議」、局方決定明日送交江灣「市長」傳筱庵、</p>
<p>意見懸殊　難望解決、至「建議綱領」、即解決此項交涉之原則、工部局主張由雙方共同管理滬西越界築路、而僞「市府」則堅持非「全面的接收」警權與行政權不可、故意見懸殊、交涉前途、障碍仍多、一般觀察家、以爲工部局雖屢表讓步、而僞方奢望極高、得寸進尺、欲求得一折衷方案、似非易事、</p>
<p>偽府態度　異常強硬</p>
<p>字林報云、「市長」傳筱庵、於星期五日午後、吿日文「大陸新報」記者稱、上海「特別市府」當繼續努力、向工部局要求完全移交滬西界外馬路區之行政權與警務權、上海西區、乃屬諸華方者、工部局應負非法侵入不屬局方的區域之責、工部局苟不承認「特別市府」之要求、則渠不接受工部局之</p>
<p>任何建議、該報記者問、滬西問題、除「特別市府」此兩要求外、是吾有其他問題、傳氏答稱、猶有收稅權·公共便利·與馬路維持費等問題、若工部局接受該兩要求、則「特別市府」願和睦解決此等問題、傳氏又披露稱、工部局總董樊克令曾建議由工部局與「特別市府」雙方代表組織</p>
<p>特別會議、聯合管理滬西、而西區由人數相等之工部局巡捕與「特別市府」警務巡邏、渠對樊氐此項建議、巳加拒絕、樊氏又主張如成立聯合議會、則由警務處副總巡姚會謨任西區警務長、該報記者問、建議被拒絕、談判</p>
<p>將否決裂、傳氏答稱、局方於下週將有新建議、惟工部局如對該兩要求不予同意、則局方無論作何種建議、「特別市府」均將不予接受、渠會吿樊氏、如樊氏解決滬西界外馬路問題、則渠將在該區立樊氏之像、</p>
<h3>各業安渡十底　到期款各莊通融展期　新放款利息自九元起</h3>
<p>滬工商業之十底比期將屆、各莊對到期之款巳允通融展期、業巳由承借之公司行號工廠、與各莊接洽、淸償到期利息、另訂新展期契的、限期自一月至六月不等、關於新信用長期放款、各莊雖允儘量承放、但巳成交者、爲數不多、其利息自九元至十二元不等、是項放款、仍須殷實舖保或保人、至於各莊之存息、均依照公會議決之內盤行市五元五角結算、關於上海金融市塲、用中中交農四行之貼放、及銀錢兩業之準備會庫調劑後、各行莊自身準備愈見充實、銀根無緊張現象、市塲異常穗定、各業之安渡十底、絕對毫無問題、</p>

<p>嚴密檢查行人</p>

<p>日兵巡邏亦頻</p>
<p>同時捕房警務人員、則亦不時在該區內逡巡、故防務相當週密、靶子及靠北一埭市房、屋內原堆有沙袋甚多、茲則已爲日方僱工撤除、自北端北江西路底起至北河南路間、未有日兵蹤跡、北河南路盡頭鐵門旁及海寗路口、則照常由英軍駐防、</p>

<h3>四鄉運滬蔬菜　日方貶價強買</h3>
<p>偽蔬菜市塲尚未成立　浦東菜販已損失不貲</p>
<p>謠傳已久之日方統制滬市蔬菜、今漸已見諸事實、經管其事者、聞係日水上憲兵隊華籍譯員、現在每日由浦東運滬之蔬菜、多被攔往虹口、一般經營蔬菜商人及菜販、莫不痛苦萬分、大中社茲將詳情誌後、</p>
<p>攔刦蔬菜</p>
<p>滬市蔬菜行商及菜販、每晨由浦東及各地運至租界之蔬素、的有民船四五十艘、其中以菱白薑山芋爲大宗、供給全滬市民蔬食之需、自本月十七日起、來滬菜船、已被攔至虹口吳淞路碼頭（又稱頭壩）、爲數的佔述滬蔬菜十分之三四、該項蔬菜、彼攔至吳淞路碼頭上岸後、悉被代日方以賤值强迫收買、然後再由日方轉售於菜市塲、一轉手間、每日可獲益</p>
<p>愚弄鄉民</p>
<p>數千元、至一般販菜鄉民、自駕菜船駛至吳淞路碼頭時、亦被日方扣留、並以早經塡就之「自願投行」證書、迫令在上面按捺手印、鄉人詢其何故、則答曰、如此則可代領通行各地之通行證、但一經捺上手印、則一船蔬菜、不啻自承願被日方收買、所謂代領通行證、全爲謊言</p>
<p>有人慫勇</p>
<p>又據菜販某首領談、上述事件、在日方先未有此意、緣有在日水上憲兵隊充譯員者、慫恿日方、始由日水上憲兵隊長給以卡片一紙、即持此卡片、在浦江中攔刦菜船至吳淞路碼頭山崎兵站市塲野菜集荷所、恐嚇與誘騙齊施、務使被攔之蔬菜、被其賤價買去始休、前日上午、有薑船數艘、的載薑數十擔、巳在裏白渡橋卸貨、經被察覺、竟强迫將其扣至虹口、貶價買去、</p>

<p>法華鎭　偽班長受傷</p>
<p>有鹽城人渾名小和泰者、年三十三歲、家住滬西法華鎭八百十號、在咋日淸晨四時左右、當該小和奏在家睡夢方酣之際、突被暴徙闖入、向其開槍數響而逸、小和泰痛極而醒、則兇手已經逸去、鮮血自創口汨汨流出、污滿床褥、人亦昏厥、其家人等驚魂稍定、送亟設法僱車將其送往海格路紅十字醫院求救、經該院醫師檢視之下、發覺槍彈係在右腰部上脅骨內、未會穿出、詢其因何被算、則含糊其詞、堅不吐實、該院以案涉血案、當亟報吿捕房、派探前往偵訊、經再三盤請、始由其供出眞相、據稱渠係滬西僞「部隊」中之「班長」、故斯案內幕、或恐涉有政治背景、刻下傷者尙未脫離險境、</p>
<p>石灰窰　一偽員斃命</p>
<p>滬西石灰窰附近、大都係平房、其間第二十四號房屋、於咋晨零點五十分左右、突然發生槍聲、當時鄰居人等、俱被從夢中驚醒、前往探視、則除發現屋中人已橫陳地上身死外、闃無所見、鮮血滿染地上、死者尙身穿軍服、身上受有致命槍傷、兇手早已遠逃、當亟喚起同居人等、設法料理、惟據調查、該被殺者乃係滬西某偽組織中之偽員云、</p>
<h3>洪昌順南貨號主家內　被人擲手榴彈</h3>

<h3>『自由中國』的新經濟氣象</h3>
<p>— 百敏</p>
<p>約翰阿煦勒著　—譯自「密勒氏評論報」—</p>
<p>上海和「自由中國」之間，仍有巨額貿易。這些貿易，是取道所剩華方按制的口岸和小部份經過中日前綫而進行的。整個說來，上海華人私人金融，繼續服從重慶訓令；而國民政府各銀行在上海匯市，依然運用若干勢力，但上海大部份商業暫以侵佔區和對外界的商業往來爲基礎。今日的上海。距離「自由中國」如此遙遠，戰事已在滬市和仍由中政府管理的區域之間，樹立障碍極多，本埠的多種商業，對於繼續擁護武裝抗日的地區，巳失去了接觸。然而爲上海利益計，仍需密切熟悉「自由中國」經濟和金融發展的一般趨勢和詳情，「自由中國」巳是如今這一個國家的重要經濟能力的所在地。</p>
<p>巳往幾星期中，筆者有熟悉中國情况；允其是經濟問題的友人若干泛遊「自由中國」的大部份地方，調查歸來，會和筆者談話。他們都以爲日人雖不斷進犯，但「自由中國」各區經濟上的統一和前進，還是繼續不輟。新經濟生活和價值的樹立，巳克服日人所施的破壞和速綿戰事的疲勞。他們允其堅決說明的，是國民政府在巳往三四個月內採取的方法，巳整個表明有利於「自由中國」的經濟和金融。</p>
<p>法幣自七月間跌價後，它的地位，已經鞏固。中日戰爭最初兩年中，法幣準備金大量流出，而置法幣於嚴重壓力下，但現在上海市塲上外匯所受的大規模壓迫，業巳停止，而使法幣準備金不致大量流出。「自由中國」的支付差額，大概柑等，已歷三個月，「自由中國」依然入超很多。但在外國的華僑匯欶回國，巳完全抵銷了這差額，匯來本國的款項，巳往三個月中，平均幾達一萬萬元。在外匯方面來說，此數並不較去年寄回的款項减少。廣州·厦門和汕頭，以前是匯來款項的重要中心地，日人雖控制這三地，但絕不能得到海外華僑寄回本國的大量外匯，中政府銀行和海外華僑商會，巳作有效的佈置，使日人得不到道種利益。</p>
<p>中國政府四銀行紙幣流通額的總數，在本年十月一日，祇稍逾二十七萬萬元，照目前的上海匯率算，這流通額等於美金二萬萬元有奇。就他方面說，這四銀行的外匯和硬貨準備金却合美金八千萬元左右。所以，按照公開行市匯率，法幣和準備金的百分比幾達百分之四十，中政府當然至少能在「自由中國」維持美匯七角半與八角半的匯率很久。</p>
<p>輸入「自由中國」的外貨，並未隨歐戰爆發而立刻低落。歐洲各交戰國駛來中國的航輪，雖巳减少，但運入中國的種種供應物品，仍因海防口岸貨物擁擠，而高積該地。本來有法國當局或將在這些物品中微發一部份之虞，但因宋子文和越南總督的磋商，結果圓滿，巳沒有此虞了。日後中國在海防辦理過境貿易的範圍，將較不久以前的範圍爲少，但法國巳准許相當增加中國取道西貢的過境貿易。</p>
<p>「自由中國」境內，在七月間所頒的新輸入禁令，巳有充分的效果。中政府續發特別執照，准許數量有限的被禁貨物輸入，祇少數是例外的，對於頒布禁令前，巳經運抵海防的貨物，照例都發給執照。整個說來，在「自由中國」的外人貿易界，對於中國統制外國貿易的新制度，祇有少數偶發不平之言。中國一般人民似在準備加以補救，以防外商遭受過分的困難，特別是劃出外匯償付入口品貨價一舉，似乎正在令人滿意地進行着。</p>
<p>從泰西的觀點看來，自七月間法幣跌價後，「自由中國」境內的物價水準巳大增，在內地，舶來品與上海所製貨物的市價，大多較上海高漲幾倍，甚至在以前生活程度特低的昆明與貴陽等城市，在泰西標準上的生活程度，也見高漲。在他方面，這種價格的增高；對於中國民衆的生活，很少或根本沒有影響。本年夏末與秋季，「自由中國」的多數部份，食糧豐收，中政府與各省當局不得不採取辦法，以防穀賤傷農。在這種情勢下，兼以法幣目前留處低的匯率水準上，「自由中國」出口的維持，多以交通是賴。（未完）</p>
<h3>孕婦被踢傷案　着由法醫檢騐</h3>
<p>三被告仍一味支吾狡賴　受傷人負傷到法院作證</p>
<p>寓居北河南路圖甫里二十一號門牌之通州婦人朱李氏、年三十歲、本月八日下午六時、至同路四號胞弟李妙全處索欠借款五十元不還、致起口角、詛弟妙全、竟與妻王氏將她兇毆倒地、朱李氏懷有六個月之身孕、被弟用足</p>

<p>毒心如此</p>
<p>遂延馬君碩律師投匯司捕房報吿、派中西探將李妙全夫婦及帮兇陳連其等三人、先後拘解第一特區法院訊押在案、前晨、黃日昇推事蒞庭研審、捕房律師厲志山起稱、現被害人朱李氏、由北西藏路難民醫院轉送法租界古拔路專門產科醫院醫治後、勉强負傷至庭指證、而馬律師謂朱李氏腹中胎物、是吾可保、尙難確定、爲</p>
<p>慎重生命</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>地下室裏的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>歐洲各國，特別是英法德意等國，對於防空防毒的設施，近年來非常注意。因此，不拘是城鎭或鄕村，都有地下室的設備，一有警報，就可走下去，不怕飛機的空襲了。現在英法德的戰事，正在進行，這些地下室，遇有警報時，當然又要被人利用了。人們在地下室裏，行動和起居是怎樣？也是我們所要知道的。因此，的略的寫一些在下面：</p>
<p>衣聽見了警報，走入地下室時，要是來得及，要多帶一兩件衣服。因為地下氣候比地上凉，允其是夜晚，比白天要凉多。所以可能的話，不拘男女老小，都要頂備着的。此外，防毒面具，防毒橡皮衣，當然要一同帶了走。</p>
<p>食遇到空襲劇烈時，走進了地下室，不能立刻出來。住上一天，甚至幾天也說不定。所以關於食物方面，也有相當的儲藏，或是由外面設法運入；而最適當的食物，便是牛乳和罐頭食物一類。至於飲水，也有供給的。</p>
<p>住上面說過，有時空襲警報接二連三，不能馬上出來，就得在那裏住夜。除了規模宏大的地下室設有睡的地方外，多數是沒有睡處的。到了晚上，祇得裹了毯子，坐在地上。但醫藥室裏病床是總有幾張的。倘有人突然患病或中毒，就可睡上床去醫治。至於音樂室，無綫電收音機，大些的地下室裏是都有的，這樣可以稍解避沉悶。</p>
<p>行有了警報，行動最是耍緊，須接受軍警或童軍的指揮。嚴守秩序，吾則就會肇禍。走進地下室，行動也不自由，須受限制。警報沒有解除，絕對不准走出，使敵機發覺目標。警報解除了，也要有秩序的走出去，不准你爭先，吾則就要受軍警的處分。</p>
<h3>提倡國產棉布</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>「全家都在秋風裏，九月衣裳未剪裁。」這是黃仲則的一首妙詩，此情此景，形容目前孤島上多少人家眞是再也沒有比這淋漓盡致的了。</p>
<p>「天冷了！要添一件衣服。」這句話差不多巳變成了許多人的口頭禪，但是一切都貴的今日，添些什麼好呢？嗶嘰呢絨，櫥窗裹標着的價目，眞要使人咋舌，綢緞絲葛稍能便宜點，但比去年則增加不少了。所以衣服在不得不添的需要時，我要忠告孤島上的士女們，你們儘量的採用國貨吧！</p>
<p>記得以前，敎育家邰爽秋博士會提倡過土布運動，雖然土布運動在原則上是一個挺迫切的辦法，但事實上並未經過多少人奉行過，也許土布的條件不能適合衆望。本來，穿衣服也不能忒求實除，尤其在上海這樣一個環境裹，形式方面的美觀也是不可缺少的。但是我相信現在上海綢布店裏的國產棉布，眞有不少好看花樣，有趣圖案的種類哩。只要大家肯拋棄「非絲不上身」的念頭，那末大家都穿棉布，並不是一樁辦不到的事情。同胞們，前方抗戰多麼地熱烈啊！我們在孤島上的，怎麽好使一顆心冷冰冰呢？</p>
<h3>安定身心的佛像展覽</h3>
<p>— 凡</p>
<p>在衆生紛擾氣氛，包圍孤島人生的大路；演出了局勢上舍本逐末的趨向，社會上逆子弑父的怪事，物價的飛漲，在風暴雨的襲擊，道都是從人類身心的不能安定所激起</p>
<p>佛像，是吾有能力來安定社會？這是笑話；但是展覽佛像，具有激發人們身心安定的動機那是當然的社敎。</p>
<p>錢化佛氏生平致力於畫佛，幾四十年，與白龍山人同為東亞摹臨佛像的聖手。中日兩國，南洋各島，都讚謂深得佛像莊嚴的神髓。今山人巳歸道山，錢氏是僅存的碩果了！</p>
<p>化佛除畫佛外，並留心搜羅史料，所以從遜淸遺老，與當道巨公手中得到的碎錦殘簡，為世人所購求未得的，也將在會中附佛像展覽。使閱者知道大下事的成敗，都有前因後果。</p>
<p>聞錢氏此次展覽的中外名貴作品，為數甚巨，於國史，社會，風俗，都有相當價值；更有歷代泉幣，奇特簡帖，火柴商標，捲烟畫片，名人眞蹟，方外典籍。將四十年收藏，盡獻公衆，意在使社會人士的爭權奪利之心，潛移默化到安定上去。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>這幾天大紮蟹巳大批的上市了，無論大公司小酒店以及街頭巷口，都有若干隻挺大的蟹簍子可以看見，男男女女，圍了一大堆，有的閒看，有的在買，眞是熱鬧得很。俗說「九雌十雄」，農曆九月，正是吃雌蟹的好時光，可是西風雖起，天氣尙未發冷，吃蟹還嫌早些，無論雌的雄的，都覺得太瘦，肉頭也不很結實，而價格却分外的貴，竟有每隻買到一元和一元半的，一笙蟹簡直可以低過我菜單中兩葷兩素的菜了。筆者旣在標榜經濟，當然不吃這種不經濟的蟹；然而見蟹不吃，未免食指大動，我喜歡吃蟹粉，對於炻蟹的感情倒不過如此。昨天上菜市去，就出四角錢買了八隻小蟹，炻熟後，出了一飯碗的蟹粉，又配上了一角錢猪肉，切成了絲，打兩隻雞蛋在內，再加五分錢韭芽，用菱粉調和了一炒，居然炒成兩碗蟹羹。我們一家大小，吃得津津有味，筆者以為這種惠而不費的吃法，實在吃炻蟹之上。</p>

<h3>侍者的博學</h3>
<p>辜鴻銘是我國的名士，他是中國第一個精通十餘國外國文字的人。非但通，而且能講。有一次，他在慶祝歐戰和議成功的席上，招待各國所到的代表，都直接用各國的語言致詞，這當然引起了合座人的驚歎，驚歎他的博學。正在這時，却有一個中國的侍者，拿了一張菜單，指着菜單上一個古怪的菜名問題：「辜先生！這道菜要不要？」辜氏瞠目答道：「這是什麽菜啊？我可不識得。」這時有人同他開玩笑說：他的語言還不如侍者的博，因為侍者能知道菜單上古怪的外國菜名，而辜氏竟有不識得的。（王沛）</p>
<p>經濟食堂　吻雲作</p>
<h3>深秋風景畫</h3>
<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>—寒衣時節話編織—</p>
<p>「秋　雨秋風愁煞人」，以人物喻，曾有人以嫠婦來作秋的象徵。有人愛充滿少年朝氣的春，也有人愛英雄般熱烈的夏，却很少人會愛上這滿腔幽怨的嫠婦呵！果然，那「風吹桐葉落」的那陣秋風，深夜聽來，不有點如泣如訴嗎？秋是够肅殺的。</p>
<p>但，慢着，當看到女郞手中捧着的絨綫球，一針一針在編結着精巧玲瓏的織物時，這種「肅殺」，眞要給趕得無影無踪了。固然，絨錢的本身和色彩會令人們感到一陣子暖，就是那尖尖十指上上下下有規律的擺動，該是「肅殺」的心房，也會給挑動得有點溫暖的。允其是如果有機會遇到那新新公司絨綫部的倪小姐時，這種「溫暖」，會勝過春天了。</p>
<p>伊名秀悅，伊的明眸，伊的皓齒，伊那靈巧的指尖……逗人啊，這給襯在絢爛的絨綫堆裏的姑娘，是一朶花，是一朶點綴秋光，風標獨勁的菊。</p>
<p>伊在新新公司的職務，是解答顧客關於編結的詢問。工作時間是每天下午二時至六時。伊雖然有點「頑皮小姐」的風格，可是做起事來，却是非常認眞的。</p>
<p>伊每天除了上「玻璃電臺」襄助黃培英小姐敎授編織課程的四十分鐘外，整個下午便在答覆着這些怎樣起針，怎樣配色，這花樣應該怎樣織等問題，簡直是被太太小姐們包圍着了。伊嘴裏不憚煩地說了一遍又一遍，十指是不停地接過這位太太的織上幾針，又替那位小姐來上一個花樣。有時實在是給伊忙不過來的。有人看不過眼，有點不忍似的勸伊不必說得那麽詳細明白，可以省點兒勁。可是伊說：「那怎麼可以呢？這是顧客應享的權利，我也得盡我的職責啊。這編結工作，你們男子是不會懂得的，如果織錯一針，那才麻煩呢。」於是伊仍然那麼柔和耐心地服務了。</p>
<p>然而，伊有時也會感喟似的說：「一個少女懂得編織也可說是一種苦差事。像你們這麽一件貼身背心，總得一針一針的織起來，數數看，一共要多少針呢？沒有耐心，眞是織不成的。穿的人只覺得暖，知吾人家十個指頭的辛苦呢？」、</p>
<p>最後，還得告訴各位，伊年紀雖只十九歲，可是「絨綫媽媽」這令人稱羨的頭銜，却是傳遍一時了，原因是伊為着解答那些孩子服裝的詢問，伊身傍是常放着那個大洋娃娃。一會兒戴帽，一會兒穿衣，伊是顯得那麼熟練，而流露着偉大的「母愛」啊！</p>

<h3>向親戚捐款</h3>
<p>— 時軼</p>
<p>把收據簿拿到了手，却又有點躊躇，雖然只是一本五張收據的簿子，但是二十五塊錢眞是談何容易？一角兩角的捐，自信還可以凑個七八塊，這五塊錢一張收據，恐怕連半張也沒有人捐，事情很明顯，想來想去總是沒有法子</p>
<p>担擱了三四天，連腦子裹也我不到一偭「主顧」。記得前幾次的節的救難捐，樂善捐，「主顧」至少在二十以上，不過只是一角二角的「小玩意」，現在要他們一人出個三塊五塊的，那簡直是做夢。就一角兩角的捐吧，收據上根本寫不了這些名字，即使寫得下，捐款的人們叉不願意，眞是左右為難，其實也怪不了他們，他們只有一角二角的能力，因此我決定不向他們開口，揀一個「有錢」的「主顧」再說。</p>
<p>好容易想到了一個，是我的親戚，以前的捐款，他總出一元大洋的，而且他也很有些錢，不過似乎很難說，親戚朋友往往是交義不交財，雖然這不是我向他借錢，但是拿前二决的捐款情形看來，實在是看我面子的，這一番「叉是我」上門捐錢，我這個面子不知要怎樣大才適合呢？絮絮叨叨的曉以因果，那應該是街頭「乞捐者」所為，非是我們熱人而前要開口的；進一步，他若是肯捐了，假如又是敷衍了事，我豈能向他爭多？退一步，他若是謝絕了，我難道向他責以大義嗎？一切的親戚間的禮儀聯繫，完全掃地割斷，我實在担不起這個責任。我眞想「管他媽的」，但我的心在吿訴我：「你永遠不會這樣做的！」</p>
<p>硬一硬頭皮，想發個利市，把收據捧上了：</p>
<p>『哈，又來討厭你……實在沒有法子，却不過……你替我帮帮忙吧！』</p>
<p>「怎麼，又要捐哪？』</p>
<p>一個大「三」字在我眼前一閃，我怎麼不明白，他是第三决聽到我這些話了，我連忙咂咂嘴：</p>
<p>『唉，眞沒辦法……這是捐給兵士的，今年冬天大概冷得很，他們衣服都缺乏，我們每人要負責幾套，我實在沒法想，總是來找到你，哈……』我說了一大堆自己也沒有思慮過的話，臉上有點發熱。</p>
<p>他把收據看了看，像是疑惑是我偽造的，忽然手仲進袋子裏……我心裏一跳。</p>
<p>『替我寫一元吧！』</p>
<p>我又是一跳。</p>
<p>『一元不好寫收據……五元折合一套，十元兩套……』</p>
<p>『哈哈哈，五塊錢我不來，五塊錢我不來！』</p>
<p>『一元不好寫收據呀！』我想誘他：『有收據的，將來可以把名字印在報上……』</p>
<p>『我用不着收據，你把錢拿了，再有人捐四塊，收據就給那個人好了。』</p>
<p>如此，我再也不能多說一句話，我不糊塗，這根本是敷衍行事，這一元還算是我面子的價值哩！我在事前就有一套打算，果然不出我之所料，雖然我不曉得為了這一塊錢，他會不會討厭我，把親戚間的禮儀情分毀壞無遺，我簡直不敢想下去。</p>
<p>現在我握了一張一元法幣，拿了一本未書一字的收據簿，實在有點「尷尬相」，這唯一的門也關了，更何處有第二個門？假使我有錢，補上個四元，也就是「敷衍」了事，然而我既沒錢，又不甘心「敷衍」，怎麼是好呢？</p>
<p>記得前决的捐款，我的一個朋友，他到他親戚各處去一趟，就捐得了五十塊錢。雖然這還算不了怎麼多，可是我始終不明白，是不是他的親戚多，慷慨；還是他有「門檻」？或者，他簡直把親戚間的情分壞了來硬捐？至少至少，兩方面恰到好處（一句極複雜的話）凑合產生出好成續來，而偏偏我這倒楣鬼，「天時，地利，人和，」一件也碰不到，弄到後來，自己的良心也得喝上一陣寒西北風！</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>說也奇怪！人們的談話，好似蔓生之草，儘管蔓延過去的。她們不過在路上，看見了鄉人新採下的栗子，便這樣的講起來。從桂花栗子，購到了接種，從果樹接種，再講到了異族結婚。再要講下去，不知要講到什麼地方去呢？所以放行的人，最怕是孤單的客，倘然有了兩三位伴侶，談談說說，那就寫意得多咧。一刻兒工夫，已經到了蘇州，便把汽車，直開到東吳大學吳君素的寄宿舍來。她們上决巳經來過一回，這一决，正是駕輕車就熟路了。君素姊妹，因為前天就巳的好了的，在家中等着他們。好在她星期六下午沒有課，連吳君可也是這天下午空閑的。她們到她家裏時，却見除了她們姊妹兩人外，還有一位女客在那裏。這位女客，何家兩位小姐，自然不認得，而朱愛人却有些面善，好像在那裏見過一面的。她年紀的模二十三四，身軀並不高大，而顯出健美的風姿。一種機警活潑的神情，不自覺的流露出來。她穿的是一種女士們騎馬的服裝。但她並不是騎馬來的，只看吳君素的屋子外面，花砌之畔有一架機器腳踏車停着，便可知道這位小姐，是機器腳踏車的主人了。何家兩位小姐，由吳君素的介紹，知道那位小姐，姓邵名慧華，是浙江金華人。她是上海某報館的一位外勤女記者，與金澹雲女士是最親愛最要好的姊妹，這一回，也是到上海去吃金澹雲喜酒的，到吳君素那裏來，也是結伴同行。這時朱愛人猛然想起來了，有一决，在上海一個宴會席上，她曾經遇到她。而且她的坐席，恰巧和她並肩，她曾殷殷的問起芣愛人，回國了多少年？在美國若干時期？她也記得她的名字的確是呌邵慧華咧。原來這位邵小姐，眞是一位出衆的人村。她能開汽車，駕飛機，划船，騎馬，爬山，跑冰，游泳，打球無一不精。這些都是體魄上事，關於她智慧上的事，也是非常難得。她見到一個人，就可以知道這個人的性質如何。而且她的記憶力非常之強，當愛人這决見到他時，但覺得很為面善，一時想不起是誰。而邵小姐就記得某一次在宴會上，遇到朱醫師的話，馬上說了出來。（一九六）</p>
<h3>滬東勞工生活近况</h3>
<p>— 謝天申</p>
<p>現時滬市除了曹家渡一帶成工廠區外，還有一個處於滬東楊樹浦的工廠區。那裏大規模的工廠有四十多所，小的不下百餘家，勞工們的總數，的在十餘萬以上。</p>
<p>那裏雖與中心區距近咫尺，但因時勢而劃分了陰陽河界，大概在河南（蘇州河南）居住的人們，和河北區域的人們音訊隔絕了，所以對於滬東區的勞工們生活情形不很明瞭罷？筆者有一友人，服務於楊樹浦區的一所工廠中，略述及勞工們生活概况：</p>
<p>關於裏那住的問題，要算是生活中最易解決的一項，不過，有一個缺點，便是缺少電燈和自來水，倘若你需要水電的話，只得另繳水電費，才能達到目的。工友們都沒有担起電費的能力，祇以火油燈代光。</p>
<p>食的方面，半載以前，尚可差持。最近的幾個月來，物價騰漲，昔日兩毛錢一斤生油，現在非六毛錢不能辦到。這些土產的日常食料，並非受外匯的影響，而是×人斂納層層雜捐苛稅，奸商壟斷市塲，以致一種不可申訴的打擊和痛苦，加重在勞工身上。而且在虹口以日幣為主要貨幣？甚至於毫無信用的偽鈔，居然流行充斥市面，在那裏使用偽幣的價值，却比國幣來得高。有些有國家觀念底熱血商人，他們賣買貨物，亦通行國幣。（虹口區內賣買貨物，也通用國幣，但拒收是件極平常的事，你不能據理與爭，不然吃虧不少。）照目前生活的程度，即是整月薪金，尚不能應付整月的食糧。</p>
<p>他們每日工作的時間，通常十小時，工資按日計算，日資一元或八角一元二角不等。在廠裏工作，受為虎作倀的工頭或高級職員虐待，如不滿意時，飽享拳踢，是常有之事，他們在那環境與及飯碗問題束覊之下，只得吞聲忍氣。</p>
<p>此外，有一班喪心病在的人，利用時機，在工廠附近開設不少賭館，從事吸收勞工們血汗易來的金錢。為了這個原因，致不少勞工們的家庭中，演出不幸的悲劇。</p>
<p>那些在飢餓綫上掙扎的勞工們，講到他們的行動，是絕對不自由，生命一點也沒有保障。他們並不願受着束覊，只是因為生活的驅使，而把生命置於旦夕的境遇中，但他們也都在企圖作生命轉機的掙扎。</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>南國麟兒</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>為了遷就一個演員的演技而特地為他編製劇本，在好萊塢已成了一時風尚，但是這是捨本求末的辦法，譬如宋雅海妮的溜冰片，現在就難乎為繼了，同樣，寶貝白玲自「梨園思子」「虹影花聲」之後，也沒有超特的新作。長此以往，一個倖運的新人將依舊由發掘者親手毀滅了他的前途。同時，在演員本身，也應不繼地學習，探求，一個演員（其他技術人材也是一樣的）的成功，決不是機會造成的。</p>
<p>「南國麟兒」已偏重於大合唱，但它沒有簪寶貝白玲開闢一條新的途徑，因之，賓貝白玲更喪失了演戲的機會。</p>
<p>導演者以農奴歡唱開塲，農奴歡唱終塲，先後呼應，這該是處理歌唱片（允其是偏重於大合唱）最好的手法，但是在農奴從瑞德（農園主人）轉入馬丁的掌握之後，如寶貝白玲和卡頓（老農奴）的友愛，及馬丁出響農奴等戲，都草率地放過，以致全片成了片段的割據狀態，大合唱的先後呼應，也顯沒有力量了。</p>
<p>至於本劇的主旨，把農奴從新主人手中奪回來，那也不過是廉價的同情而巳。</p>

<h3>The Great Strength of the Chinese People Lays the Foundation for the War of Resistance; The Recovering Strength of Farmers in the War Zone is Astonishing; Demonstrating Full Cooperation Between the Army and the People Everywhere</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to reports from the commanders of various Chinese army units at the front, the recovering strength of Chinese farmers in the occupied areas and in areas near the occupied areas, which are constantly threatened by Japanese army invasions, is the fundamental strength that allows China to wage an unlimited long-term war. The ability of Chinese farmers to revive their villages, rebuild their homes, and resume cultivation can be seen in the areas west of the Xinqiang River and north of Changsha that the Japanese army has invaded. In the towns, there are many coolies engaged in clearing away the rubble and debris. In the countryside, farmers are building temporary thatched huts to guard against the Japanese army's return to northern Hunan in the near future. In the war zone, although men are the majority, women and children can be seen everywhere helping with the reconstruction work in the villages and bringing back food from the nearby mountains. This phenomenon can also be seen in Changsha. According to a certain foreigner, he traveled all over Changsha on September 26 and saw only five people. It is believed that all the others had been forcibly evacuated. On October 17, General Xue Yue told reporters that the population of Changsha had reached 30,000. However, after only five more days, the number of civilians returning to Changsha had reached 50,000. This phenomenon can be regarded as full cooperation between the army and the people. At the same time, the return of residents also indicates their full trust in the army's protection. In other countries, after the destruction of transportation lines, economic life would be hindered. However, in China, because of its abundant manpower, this is not a problem. When the reporter was in northern Hunan, he saw countless coolies all over the mountains and fields, either carrying on their shoulders or carrying on poles, constantly transporting food that had been moved to the mountains during the Japanese army's invasion westward and southward. As for military supplies and ammunition, they were constantly transported to the front lines. Their spirit of not fearing hardship is truly admirable. Hunan was originally China's granary. Before the war, Hunan's products were all transported by the Yangtze River. Since the Japanese army occupied the Yangtze River area, Hunan has been economically suffocated. This is a factual problem. On the other hand, in areas fully controlled by the Chinese side, there are few instances of profiting from the war. At the same time, due to the particularly good harvest this year, self-sufficiency is fully possible. Rice and vegetable prices are even lower than before the war. Although labor costs in Sichuan are three times higher than before the war, there is still a shortage of workers. The wages of workers in Hunan range from 50 cents to 1.5 yuan per day, but they seem to be satisfied on the surface. At least, the reporter did not see any complaints. This is very different from the workers in Sichuan Province. Although the transportation lines in northern Hunan have been greatly destroyed and the situation is relatively isolated from the outside world, trade still exists. According to customs officials, before the war, Xiang Customs' revenue was 280,000 yuan per month. Currently, it is still 70,000 yuan. It is said that in order to increase trade between Hunan and Sichuan, the Chinese side plans to use the inland river to Yichang. According to General Xue Yue, it is not impossible for the Japanese to control Dongting Lake, but it is definitely difficult to cut off inland river transportation. According to foreigners in Changsha, Japanese goods from Hankou are flowing into the Changsha area. However, due to the perfect cooperation between the Chinese army and the people, the inflow of Japanese goods has been blocked. When Chinese merchants discover that the goods they are handling are Japanese goods, they return the goods and receive a refund of the paid customs duties. At the same time, the Japanese goods are confiscated by the Chinese government. Therefore, although a lot of Japanese goods flowed in previously, since the order was issued by Chongqing to ban them, the appearance of Japanese goods has been almost completely eliminated.

<h3>The Chinese Army in Eastern Laiwu, Shandong, Recaptures Lucun</h3>
<p>A Certain Place in Shandong: More than 3,000 Japanese troops from Xintai, Laiwu, and other places launched a large-scale attack on Lucun (east of Laiwu) on the evening of the 22nd. The village had once fallen into Japanese hands. At noon on the 23rd, the main force of the Chinese army arrived and immediately launched a counterattack against the Japanese. The artillery fire from both sides was extremely intense. The Chinese infantry were exceptionally brave, breaking into the Japanese lines and engaging in hand-to-hand combat for several hours. The Japanese could not withstand the attack and collapsed and fled towards Nanya and Yanzifeng. Lucun was then recaptured. (9th dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army in Fengxin Achieves Victory: Capturing Strongholds and Advancing in Three Routes; Fierce Fighting in the Nantang Area of Yueyang</h3>
<p>Xiushui: Starting at dawn on the 29th, the Chinese army concentrated a certain elite force and launched a fierce attack on the southwest of Fengxin. More than 2,000 Japanese troops there resisted stubbornly based on fortifications. After a half-day of fierce attack by the Chinese army, more than 700 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. Nali was finally captured by the Chinese army at noon, and the remaining Japanese soldiers retreated. The Chinese army in Fengxin is continuing to pursue them in three routes. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: On the ancient road from Jingguo Town, south of Yueyang, to Xinkaitang, Qinggangyi, and Xinqiangzhen, fierce fighting has taken place between the Chinese and Japanese armies in the past two days. On the 27th, the Japanese army in Qinggangyi disturbed the north bank of the Xinqiang River, but was repelled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army, cooperating with another advance force, encircled Nantang and Jingguo Town, south of Yueyang, from both sides west of the river. After a fierce battle lasting a day and a night, both the Japanese and Chinese armies suffered heavy casualties. Starting on the morning of the 29th, the Japanese army in Qinggangyi, threatened in the rear by the Chinese army, frequently bombarded the Anjiadashan and Daxiaoqiaoling areas on the north bank of the Xinqiang River, but the Chinese army suffered no losses.

<h3>The National Children's Welfare Institute Concludes its Directors' Conference; Madam Feng and Ms. Li Dequan Preside; Reporting on the Proceedings of the Ten-Day Conference</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Children's Welfare Institute concluded its directors' conference on the 29th.

During the ten days, in addition to inviting President Kong, Zhang Boling, Wu Yifang, and Mr. Zhang Naiqi to give lectures for 24 hours, the administrative report lasted for 2 hours, and the institute's report lasted for 18 hours, the rest was used for discussing proposals and reviewing work. Thirty institute directors, eight representatives of branch institutes, and all staff of the headquarters attended, and were able to discuss openly and humbly, which was extremely admirable. Statistics show that 75 proposals and 144 articles were received, all of which have been discussed. The most important of these was the proposal to determine the outline of the implementation of wartime children's education, which was discussed in the most detail. The matters discussed included: (A) Administrative matters: (1) Strengthening the organization of the welfare institute; (2) Formulating methods for evaluating the performance of directors and teachers; (3) Requesting the headquarters to send personnel to inspect the situation of each branch institute on a rotating basis; (B) Financial matters: (1) Requesting the headquarters to increase children's living expenses; (2) Stipulating the treatment of teachers and staff, adopting annual salary increases to encourage them; (C) Educational matters: (1) Combining protection and education to integrate children's lives with education; (2) Shortening the primary school curriculum to four years to complete the six-year curriculum; (D) Health matters: (1) Requesting the headquarters to comprehensively arrange the addition of doctors and nurses to improve children's health; (E) Other matters: (1) Establishing a national communication network for children in welfare institutes to strengthen emotional connections between children; (2) Requesting the national publishing industry to donate books and publications to various welfare institutes to increase the cultural sustenance of children and teachers; (3) Expanding the work of rescuing children; (4) Expelling Wang Jingwei and Chen Ji-jun from the list of honorary directors of the Welfare Association. In addition, the work situation of each institute was thoroughly reviewed in terms of administration, education, care, health, and other aspects, and the gains were quite valuable. The conference closed today, with a rest day tomorrow. It was also decided that all participants would visit the Songhu Experimental Zone on the 31st, the Leshan Welfare Institute on November 3rd, and the Yucai School in Beibei on the 3rd. It was decided to invite American personnel to give speeches. (Wu Yifang read the speech on behalf of the United States, and the representative of the welfare institute directors replied to thank them, and presented flags to Madame Chiang and Madame Feng on behalf of all the children in the welfare institutes. Madam Feng declined repeatedly, and the flags were accepted by Chen Jian, the general manager of the General Association. (29th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>America and Japan, and China and Japan</h3>
<p>Will America and Japan fight?</p>
<p>Can China and Japan make peace?</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the answer to these two questions is yes or no, they are both major issues related to the current international situation and affecting the future world. I would like to try to find answers. Before answering, two exceptions should be listed: (1) If the current war in Europe and Asia expands into a world war, and both the United States and Japan enter the vortex, then the nature of the relationship between the two countries will no longer be a matter between the two countries but a world matter; (2) If the current war between China and Japan is controlled by the international community and not by the two countries themselves, then the nature of the relationship between the two countries will fundamentally change, and it cannot be measured by normal sentiments and principles today. These two exceptions should be excluded from the scope of today's discussion.</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo telegram yesterday, "Whether relations between the United States and Japan will improve in the future or deteriorate further will be decided in the middle of next week." This statement indicates that this week is a period of important development, but whether it will improve or deteriorate remains to be seen. According to a Tokyo telegram yesterday, "On the eve of the start of negotiations between the United States and Japan, Japanese newspapers are adopting a hostile and provocative attitude towards the United States." It also said that "Foreign Minister Nomura reported to the cabinet that hopes for improving relations between the United States and Japan are very slim." It also said that the Miyako Shimbun editorial stated that if war breaks out between the United States and Japan, Japan firmly believes that it will win. Therefore, Japan will not back down under the false pretense of the United States. If the United States puts excessive pressure on Japan, only God knows the serious consequences. As for the United States, it not only sent a stern note to the Japanese government at the end of last year, but also warned the Japanese government and public with a frank speech by Ambassador Grew to Japan on the 20th of this month. This is seen in the expression of intent. At the end of July, it announced the abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, with a term of half a year. After three more months, it will be the end of January next year when the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation expires. In the past two months, the United States has been strengthening its military preparations in the Far East and the Pacific as much as possible. Next spring, it will conduct an unprecedented large-scale naval exercise in the Pacific. This is seen in practical actions. Ambassador Grew also integrated what the United States has said and done and declared, "He actually represents and conveys the general feelings of the American government and public. Public opinion in the United States regarding recent developments in the Far East is almost unanimous. It is based on facts, not propaganda. This national consensus is a force that the US government cannot ignore and will eventually be reflected in its policies and actions." Looking at the situation of both the United States and Japan, it is appropriate to make the inference that "relations between the United States and Japan are deteriorating" as Foreign Minister Nomura of Japan did. Then, will they fight?</p>
<p>The war between China and Japan is due to Japanese aggression, so Japan is the initiator and China is actually the passive party. Whether the war continues or peace is sought in the future also depends on Japan, the initiator. The key to this has already been repeatedly clarified in this newspaper. Today, the Japanese side not only has writers and commentators conveying their desire for peace to China, but also officials at all levels of the political and military authorities are saying that "the China Incident is nearing its end." Their direct and indirect propaganda is also using the fact that the Chinese National Government is seeking peace and that a certain country is mediating to promote a peaceful atmosphere. Since the key to war and peace lies with them, and their intentions are like this, then can they make peace?</p>
<p>To these two questions, we have no way to make a positive answer: to put it bluntly, the United States and Japan will definitely not fight, and it is still difficult for China and Japan to make peace. The United States and Japan: Will the United States fire the first shot at Japan? Will Japan fire the first shot at the United States? These are all inconceivable phenomena. The United States was founded on peace, advocates justice, and possesses unparalleled strength in the world. Its policies and actions are sufficient to implement its主張and punish the暴者. There are many ways to achieve the same effect as firing a shot, and there is absolutely no need to fire a shot. Not only is it equivalent, but it is enough to temporarily sacrifice a part of trade and implement a blockade in commerce and finance. The result of this is not only the same effect as firing a shot, but also has several advantages: materially speaking, a blockade is more economical than firing a shot; in terms of time, a blockade is more convenient than winning a war; in terms of method, a blockade is more humane than bloodshed; in terms of dealing with general situations, a blockade is safer than military action. Therefore, the United States will never wage war against Japan. Japan's basic international policy is to serve the strong; its people's naive consciousness is to be arrogant. Only by serving the strong has it never fought against a stronger country in history. During the Russo-Japanese War, Russia was stronger than Japan, but Japan served Great Britain before it fought Russia. During World War I, Germany was stronger than Japan, but Japan knew to cooperate with the great powers before it fought Germany. Looking at the surrender to the Soviet Union at Zhanggufeng, is it said that it will wage war against the United States in the Pacific? The national strength of the United States and Japan is far different, so Japan will never wage war against the United States. Because it is arrogant, the public still has empty talk in the newspapers that it will definitely win against the United States. Therefore, the invasion of China has trapped itself in a quagmire. It has no way to continue and is eager to end the war. The words used by well-known figures in the government and public to instruct their arrogant people are all in the tone of "bestowing grace and benevolence" on China. China's peace talks must take equality as an absolute prerequisite. Without equality, there will be no peace, and there will never be peace. This is China's absolutely consistent national policy and the most reasonable principle in the international community. However, in Japan, public opinion of "China-Japan equality" has not yet been formed. If there is no universal public opinion of China-Japan equality in Japan, then the Japanese authorities will never dare to negotiate peace with China in the spirit and form of equality. Furthermore, to infer from modern politics, Japan will never produce an authority that understands equality, believes in equality, respects equality, and strives for equality until the day it sees universal public opinion of China-Japan equality. It is hoped that those in China and Japan who aspire to seek peace will thoroughly understand this key. As of today, the key is distant, so it is said that it is still difficult for China and Japan to make peace.</p>
<p>America and Japan and China and Japan seem to be two problems, but the two are closely related. In fact, they are not two problems, but two sides of the same problem. Japan is the center of the problem. Japan may have anger towards the United States and want to fight, but it has absolutely no spirit and strength to start a war. Although it has recently created an anti-American atmosphere artificially, it can be discovered after its attempt that this atmosphere is not enough to change the United States' firm policies or scare away the United States' preparatory actions. Then, the anti-American atmosphere will be like a flash in the pan. In the future, the key, in our opinion, is definitely not as transmitted in the Tokyo telegram that "a decision will be made in the middle of next week." It is secretly thought that it is actually tied to a comparison of the following two types of time and space: Will universal public opinion of China-Japan equality be created in Japan first, and then reasonable sequential progress be made to enable peace talks? Or will the United States' policies and actions, with the passage of time, first be seen in the facts as a driving force for stabilizing the Far East?</p>
<h3>Finnish Cabinet Drafts Final Response to the Soviet Union; Delegation to Depart Soon for Continued Negotiations; Nationwide Military Preparations Actively Underway</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Finnish Prime Minister Cajander, Finance Minister Tanner, and two other cabinet members spent the entire day today drafting Finland's response to the Soviet demands. It is said that this response represents Finland's final word. They later convened with leaders of various parties to inform them of the content of the Soviet demands. The Finnish delegation will take this response to Moscow on Tuesday. Last night, Helsinki did not issue an air raid alert, but conducted a trial blackout. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The cabinet held a plenary meeting this afternoon, during which the delegates who had just returned from Moscow reported on the negotiations with the Soviet government. The speakers of both houses of parliament also separately met with leaders of various political parties, informing them in secret of the Soviet demands. According to well-informed sources, the Finnish delegation will travel to Moscow for the third time no later than November 1st to continue negotiations. In addition, members of a Finnish choir are scheduled to hold concerts tomorrow in front of the residences of the American and Scandinavian ambassadors to express gratitude for the moral support given to Finland by the heads of those countries. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>London: According to Rome Radio, the Soviet Union's demands to Finland include two articles: a military alliance and the granting of air and naval bases to the Soviet Union. It is reported that Finland intends to reject the military alliance because it conflicts with neutrality, but is willing to grant air and naval bases to the Soviet Union in exchange for land in the Soviet Autonomous Republic of Karelia. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Finland is actively strengthening its defenses and taking various emergency precautions in preparation for any eventuality. The people of major border cities and towns have been completely evacuated. Residents of urban centers and rural areas have been ordered to evacuate compulsorily. Helsinki has implemented a blackout, plunging the entire city into darkness. Air defense facilities are also being rapidly expanded, and many trenches have been dug. The entire country is in a state of mobilization, but the authorities have repeatedly issued reassurances to the public, emphasizing that all measures are purely precautionary. Negotiations in Moscow are still ongoing. They hope that the people of the country will abide by discipline and not become pessimistic or unduly anxious. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Soviet government is intensifying its pressure on the Finnish government in order to obtain various benefits. The German newspapers are also very interested in Finland's mineral resources. According to these newspapers, Finland's copper mines are the richest in Europe, with an estimated 20 million tons of ore available for extraction. The nickel produced in the country is an essential metal for the armaments industry. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to well-informed sources, if the Soviet-Finnish negotiations reach a deadlock, Finland may propose, based on the Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Pact, that both sides appeal to neutral countries to form an arbitration committee to resolve various difficult issues through peaceful means. However, it is not yet known which countries will be invited to serve as members of the arbitration committee. At present, Finland is still making diplomatic efforts to clarify its relationship with the Soviet Union. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: To express their goodwill towards the United States and the Scandinavian countries, the Finnish people held a parade in Helsinki, singing various songs and shouting cheers as they passed in front of the embassies of those countries. The atmosphere was very lively. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>Paris: Diplomatic circles here recently stated that a certain European country is shrouded in an atmosphere of instability, and the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Finland are shrouded in mystery. Although Finnish officials appear quite optimistic on the surface, the news obtained by diplomatic circles in Moscow and the capitals of the Scandinavian countries is alarming. The information from Sweden is particularly pessimistic, and the Swedish government has taken various military measures as a precaution. Generally speaking, the Finnish government has probably agreed to the Soviet government's request not to build defensive fortifications on the Åland Islands, as this is not included in Finland's budget for next year. However, other requests infringe on Finland's sovereignty and are difficult to accept. The Finnish government is therefore trying to delay the matter and informing the people that sacrifices may be necessary if necessary. Germany is also using diplomatic channels and newspapers to express the opinion that the Scandinavian countries must find their own way to resolve their relations with Finland and cannot rely on other countries (referring to Britain). German diplomats in Finland have also accused Britain of abandoning small countries. Germany's attacks on Britain are all-encompassing, as can be seen here. In addition, there is one thing that is difficult to explain: Germany is selling a portion of the armaments it obtained in Poland to Finland, probably in order to obtain cash. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>Lithuanian Troops Enter Vilnius</h3>
<p>Kaunas: Lithuanian troops occupied Vilnius at 2:30 PM yesterday. The city is now the capital of Lithuania. Last month, Soviet troops seized the city from Poland and handed it over to Lithuania. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Vilnius: After the Lithuanian army entered the city, General Vitkauskas inspected it. Representatives of the Lithuanian, Polish, Belarusian, and Jewish communities delivered speeches, expressing their welcome. In addition, a portion of the Soviet troops remains stationed in the city and is gradually withdrawing. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Lithuanian troops entered Vilnius yesterday. Lithuanian Prime Minister Černius sent a telegram to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, expressing his sincere gratitude.

<h3>Increased Artillery Warfare on the Western Front; German Troops Concentrated on the Swiss Border; Aerial Combat Occurs Over Scotland</h3>
<p>Paris: Yesterday, the activity of the German Air Force behind the lines and the movement of German reconnaissance units served as a warning that the German army is about to launch a major offensive. On Friday, German artillery batteries fired on the French Maginot Line with artillery that had not been used since the outbreak of the European War. The increased activity of the German artillery batteries is also a prelude to a German offensive. The French army immediately intensified its artillery fire. Along a 90-mile stretch from the Moselle River to the Rhine River, the artillery warfare on both sides was very intense. At the same time, French reconnaissance units continued to operate, investigating the German army's intentions. Based on the rate of artillery fire, the French side estimates that the German army fired more than 20,000 shells in the past 24 hours. There were no losses on the French line. It is reported that thousands of German aircraft have been concentrated along the French-Belgian-Dutch border. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to radio news today, information has been received confirming that Germany is gathering a large army on the North Sea coast between Bremen and Hamburg. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Paris: According to well-informed French sources, German troops are still being concentrated on the Swiss border. It is reported that the Swiss authorities have already implemented precautionary measures. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Bern: An official statement issued here today stated that there is no reason for Switzerland to be particularly concerned about the concentration of German troops outside Switzerland's northern border. The rumor that Germany has gathered twelve divisions there does not correspond to the facts. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>London: The British Air Ministry recently announced that British aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights over several areas in southern Germany last night and all returned safely to their bases. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>A letter from a French infantry officer on the Western Front, published in "Le Figaro" in Beijing and Paris, stated that he is stationed on the front lines, surrounded by forests. Although there is no fighting during the day, there are many unexpected incidents at night. The German troops are quite brave and often cross the outposts, pass through the forests, and reach the French rear. Gunfire continues throughout the night, but the French suffer little loss even when the German troops fire from 20 to 30 meters away, because the targets are unclear in the dark. The outpost line is about 2 kilometers from the officer's location, but the forest is very dense and the German troops are familiar with the terrain, so they can bury landmines near the French camp. One day, a landmine was stepped on by a cow and exploded. Another day, a colonel's car was also blown up by a landmine. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry recently issued a statement stating that several of our aircraft flew to southern Germany last night for reconnaissance and returned safely. In retaliation, several German aircraft conducted reconnaissance over Scotland and the Orkney Islands this morning. We immediately issued an air raid alert, and several fighter planes took off to intercept them. One was shot down east of Dalkeith. The four pilots were killed on the spot, and two were captured, one of whom was already injured and was immediately taken to Edinburgh. When the aircraft of the two countries engaged in aerial combat, more than 600 residents risked watching the battle. It is said that when the German aircraft discovered that British fighter planes were following them, they used various methods, tumbling up and down, in an attempt to escape, but the British fighter planes followed closely behind and fired machine guns at them. The bullets rained down and hit the vital parts, causing the German aircraft to fall to the ground. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Beijing: According to news from Berlin received here today, military developments can occur at any time. As for the content of the developments, only Hitler and his entourage know. Well-informed sources believe that these developments will be directed against Britain. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>London: The Reuters correspondent accompanying the British Air Force in France recently telegraphed from French territory, stating that even if the German Air Force is dispatched, the British Air Force can carry out large-scale destruction or decisive action against German military targets in the first week. Whether these targets are troop concentrations, naval and air bases, or munitions factories will depend on the German military's operational strategy. The British Air Force will be dispatched as soon as it receives orders and will not waste any time. This is the key point in any plan formulated by the British Air Force, aiming to inflict heavy damage on the enemy in all aspects and achieve the effect of the deployment. The officers and men of the British Air Force on the front lines and in the rear in France are all prepared to be dispatched immediately. The elite members of the British Air Force will launch the first strike. There is no indication when the order to depart will be issued. Before the order is received, it is essential not to waste the officers, soldiers, or aircraft. This is why there has been little activity on the Western Front in the past few weeks. Reconnaissance flights over enemy positions are continuing, but have been reduced to the minimum level necessary to explore essential military information. The German Air Force's potential retaliatory capabilities cannot be ignored, but the efficiency of British aircraft production is now gradually surpassing the strength of Germany's existing first-line and reserve aircraft. Once an air battle breaks out, the Allied Air Force will be commanded by British officers, just as the Allied forces on the battlefield are under the command of General Gamelin. There are pilots from the Dominions in all the British Air Force squadrons. Whether they come from Australia, Canada, or South Africa, they are all highly skilled in driving and making weapons. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a communiqué stating that the artillery warfare in the Moselle area intensified on Friday. Allied troops attacked German positions in the Watter Forest area but were repulsed by the German army. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>

<h3>Allied Air Force Shows Superiority</h3>
<p>Paris: Newspapers here today reported that the combined air power of Britain and France will be three times stronger than that of Germany in a few months. The number of workers employed by French aircraft factories will soon reach 300,000, and the output will be five times that of the pre-war period. Recent air battles have shown that French aircraft are superior to German aircraft in both materials and operations. This superiority is expected to increase significantly. Since the start of war reconnaissance flights, there have been a total of 250 during the day and 74 at night, and a lot of valuable information has been obtained regarding the enemy's preparations and the organization of the Siegfried Line. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The Bureau of Statistics' announcement this morning that the Royal Air Force flew into the heart of Germany again last night reinforces the power of the comments made by the Observer this week. The paper commented on the action of British aircraft flying to Berlin, Hamburg, etc. on Tuesday, saying that while the aircraft did not drop bombs at the time, they could well have done so, and that the residents of the cities were aware of the fact. This proved that all major German cities could be subjected to air raids, and this was the best reason for Hitler to avoid issuing orders to bomb British and French civilians (Reuters)</p>
<h3>Comparison of British and German Naval Losses</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet Russian Naval People's Committee's newspaper "Fleet" published an article yesterday reviewing the naval losses of Britain and Germany in the six weeks since the start of the European war. It believes that this result must disappoint British military and political figures, because when comparing the numbers of warships and merchant ships lost, the damage suffered by Britain as a result of the British blockade policy is greater than that felt by Germany. In terms of total naval losses, the British and French account for 75 percent, while Germany accounts for only 25 percent. Britain has lost six warships, but Germany has only lost three submarines. In terms of merchant ships, Britain has lost 52 ships, while Germany's surface fleet and air force have not attacked them. As for transportation, although Britain should impose a blockade, Germany's transportation with the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Danube River is still unimpeded. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The German Wireless Radio Station issued a broadcast message yesterday stating that since the outbreak of the war, 156 Swedish ships have been intercepted by British warships. The Information Ministry recognized the interception, and said that up to October 25, only sixty-five vessels had been inspected by British warships, forty-three of which had already been released, and the goods they were carrying had not been confiscated. Fourteen other vessels were currently under inspection, and eight were carrying contraband, and had been wholly or partially confiscated. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Czechoslovak Independence Day; Czechs Demonstrate and March; German Military Police Intervene and Arrest Many People; Czechs in Britain Nominate Beneš as Leader</h3>
<p>Prague: Yesterday was the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic. Beneš's followers held a demonstration here. After discovering the demonstration, police officers immediately gathered in the city center to disperse the demonstrators and arrest many people, detaining them. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>London: Czechs in Britain held an Independence Day commemorative meeting in London today, unanimously supporting former Czech President Beneš, calling him the leader of the Czech people. Beneš was greatly moved and shouted "Long live Czechoslovakia." Former Czech Ambassador to the UK Masaryk gave a speech, saying that the Czech people's goal is to restore freedom to Czechoslovakia in a free Europe. "We are willing to live, work, and sacrifice our lives for this goal. We hope that the Allied countries will allow us to organize an organization to recruit and train the brave men who are willing to fight for this goal." (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen: A correspondent from the "Politiken" newspaper in Berlin telegraphed that yesterday was the national day of Czechoslovakia and that many disturbances took place in the German protectorates of Moravia and Bohemia, the most serious of which was in Prague. Several hundred Czechs adorned their hats with the Czech coat of arms and marched in groups, immediately clashing with German police, and several people were injured and fifteen arrested. The city center, St. Wenceslas Square, has been closed to traffic since noon. Protector Neurath has convened a meeting at his office to discuss how to deal with the aftermath, and to investigate whether this demonstration was launched by local reactionary elements or orchestrated by Czech exiles residing abroad. However, when the head of the Prague political police was asked by reporters, he said that the incident was not very important. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>The Hague: A correspondent from the "De Telegraaf" newspaper in Prague telegraphed that yesterday was the Czechoslovak National Day, and the Czechs held a large-scale demonstration, expressing national discipline, and there were several clashes with the Germans, the most serious of which was at 1:00 PM. At that time, several teams of National Socialist Party guards, led by a military band, were passing through Wenceslas Square on their way back to camp, followed by several Germans in cars. Several Czech youths spat at them. The Czech police, seeing this, immediately worked with the political police to suppress the crowd, driving them out of the square, but the crowd continued to shout slogans such as "Long live Beneš" and "Long live the Czechoslovak Republic." Shortly thereafter, several Czechs on a street cursed the National Socialist Party guards, and the guards fired into the air. As a result of the two clashes, several Czech demonstrators were arrested. In addition, although the Czechs brewed a strike movement, in reality, apart from the workers in a few factories who did not go to work, the employees in all other factories and shops did not carry out the strike.

<h3>Slovak New Cabinet Lineup</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to the German News Agency, Dr. Tiso, the newly elected President of Slovakia, announced the new cabinet lineup today. Former Deputy Prime Minister Ďurčanský has been appointed Prime Minister. The post of Interior Minister will be held concurrently by the former Foreign Minister Ďurčanský. There are no other changes. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Comments on German Strategy</h3>
<p>London: The "Observer" newspaper carried an article by its editor-in-chief Garvin stating that in the future, German strategy will concentrate its efforts on attacking Britain from the sea and the sky, while at the same time putting unprecedented pressure on neutral countries. Although the threatening rhetoric currently published in German newspapers is mostly absurd, it is not entirely without cause, as there is fire after smoke. Hitler and Goering, based on the old idea of directly striking the vital points on which Britain's life depends, are now making a desperate gamble. The so-called vital points of Britain are naval bases, docks, harbors, aircraft factories, important industrial areas, and transportation hubs. In other words, the real war will be the same as we predicted at the beginning of the war. One of the most acclaimed words Hitler said in the German Parliament was, "There are no more islands." We can imagine what this means. According to the British government's calm observation, Britain is fully capable of coping with air incursions. If the absolute air superiority we need is quickly created due to our country's greatest efforts in a short period of time, then the war will not only not be prolonged for three years, but true peace and world liberation can be seen in six months. With the support of the British Empire, such as Canada, and the supplies that the United States can provide through its unconstrained neutrality, this is achievable and must be achievable. The "Times" newspaper carried an article by Spender, whose tone was similar to that expressed by Garvin, also saying that since German anger is focused on Britain, we will soon encounter a serious period. However, the success of destroying submarines and preventing aircraft from damaging shipping is now making our confidence in eventual victory stronger. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Royalists Plot Restoration</h3>
<p>London: Political figures here recently stated that former Austrian royalists have been actively plotting restoration since the outbreak of the European War. Former Austrian Cabinet Counselor Prince Starhemberg has had contacts with key figures in the Czech Republic, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Hungary. It is reported that he has obtained the approval of some politicians in the Czech Republic. This group originally strongly opposed the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty, but now that circumstances have changed, they believe that the restoration would make it easier to divide Greater Germany, and they no longer have any objections. As for Italy, it does not oppose any restoration plan if it has any hope of success, but at this time, it is not convenient to express its position. As for how the countries of Western Europe will react, it is not yet known, but the Austrian restoration movement is easier to obtain the support of the countries of Western Europe than the German restoration movement, because the platform of the German restoration party is as terrible as National Socialism, and the threat it poses is as serious.

<h3>The Case of the Detained "Flint City": Conflicting Reports from Soviet and German Sides - US Government Yet to Confirm the Vessel's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Washington - Regarding the detention of the American cargo ship "Flint City," the Soviet Union and Germany are shifting responsibility. The Soviet side claims it has been released, while the German side claims no knowledge. American public opinion is increasingly indignant. According to a report received by the State Department from Chargé d'Affaires Kirk in Germany, the German Foreign Ministry and Naval Department officials only stated that the ship is still in Murmansk, Soviet Union, with all American crew members on board. A report from American Consul General Kebrling in Hamburg states that the German Prize Court has "no information" about the whereabouts of "Flint City." Additionally, Ambassador Steinhardt in the Soviet Union reported to the State Department that he attempted to speak by telephone with the captain of the "Flint City" but was unsuccessful. He only knew that all American crew members were safe. It is generally believed that the conflicting information is a deliberate smokescreen, allowing Germany to disguise the "Flint City" to sail to a German port without being intercepted by British warships. The American authorities were initially calm, awaiting the collection of various intelligence to take appropriate action. However, they are now becoming increasingly indignant and have released the conflicting reports from Germany and the Soviet Union. (Havas News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington - The State Department received a report yesterday from American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, stating that he had twice attempted to contact the crew of the "Flint City" without success. American government officials attach great importance to the "Flint City" incident. According to the American perspective, the Soviet Union's actions violate true neutrality. According to international law, except for cases where the ship cannot continue sailing due to severe storms, mechanical failures, or other unavoidable circumstances, a neutral country absolutely cannot use its ports to supply belligerent nations by using the captured vessel to a third party country. The State Department has not yet received accurate details regarding the ship's whereabouts. The State Department is about to lodge a new protest with Germany. Britain may not allow the American ship, under German surveillance, to pass freely through the blockade line. If a conflict occurs, it will endanger the lives of the American crew. According to the report from the American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, the Soviet government had notified him that the American crew was safe. According to the report from the American Chargé d'Affaires in Germany, the German Naval Department had notified him that the American crew was still on the "Flint City," which had not yet left Murmansk. This information has further aroused suspicion within the American government. It is incomprehensible why the Soviet government would not allow the American ambassador to contact the American crew. However, Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin told the American ambassador that the Soviet government had ordered the "Flint City" to leave the country. According to well-informed sources, the American vessel has already left the Soviet Union, sailing towards Germany under the surveillance of a German submarine. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Malden, Massachusetts - The German Foreign Ministry replied to Mrs. Garnett, the captain of the "Flint City," yesterday, reporting that her husband is still on the "Flint City," safe and sound. The telegram did not mention the ship's current location. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>

The source of this information is based on the convening of the Supreme Soviet meeting next Tuesday and the arrival of the Soviet trade delegation in Berlin, the second group of representatives arrived last night. It is generally believed that the Soviet government has authorized the delegation to negotiate with the German government on issues beyond commerce. Sources close to the German Foreign Ministry claim that the preliminary talks between the Soviet Union and Germany have been completed, and the situation has been clarified. "We are currently only awaiting an important decision." (Associated Press, 29th)</p>

It was previously rumored that the German authorities intended to establish a Jewish autonomous province between Lublin and the Bug River in the Polish-occupied area. However, it is widely believed that this plan can only be implemented after the constitutional issue of the entire Polish area has been resolved. (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>

<p>Istanbul - German Ambassador to Turkey Papen plans to postpone his return to Turkey due to the ongoing negotiations between Turkey and Romania. It is reported that in the Turkish-Romanian business negotiations, the Romanian business delegation will soon visit Egypt. It is generally believed that the signing of a business treaty between Romania and Turkey will weaken Germany's economic influence in Romania. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to today's French official radio message, some neutral observers in Berlin believe that the Soviet Union may launch an offensive against Romania and Turkey in the near future. It is also believed that this offensive may be assisted by the actions of the German army and air force on the Western Front. The leaders of the Nazi Party are now apparently trying to create the impression that Germany and the Soviet Union have the same interests and therefore cooperate with each other internally and externally, and that their cooperation in the Balkans does not conflict with Italy's interests. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to news from Berlin, German Foreign Ministry officials recently met with the leaders of the autonomy movements in Dobruja (formerly part of Bulgaria) and Macedonia (partly occupied by Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece), who were from Romania, and conducted discussions with them.

<h3>Romanian Agricultural Products - Increased Exports to Germany - German Minister of Food Publishes Article</h3>
<p>Berlin - German Minister of Food Müller took advantage of the German-Romanian business negotiations to publish an article in the "Landpost" newspaper, stating that the European war will not hinder German-Romanian business relations. The two countries should continue to conduct trade in accordance with the principles they have always followed and should seek to expand it as much as possible. This year, Romania's agricultural harvest has increased significantly, and Germany's grain needs will be greater than last year. In addition, Romania's livestock industry is also very prosperous. Last year, Romania's pig exports did not reach the planned amount. This year, the number of people engaged in livestock farming in the country has increased by 100 to 150 percent, so the export amount will definitely increase significantly. Last year, Romania's total exports to Germany were 240,000,000 marks. This year, it can increase to 5,300,000,000 marks, of which agricultural exports will account for two-thirds.

<h3>German Side Does Not Express Opinion on American Neutrality Act for the Time Being - Comedy or Tragedy? - Outcome to Be Determined in the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German side yesterday refused to criticize the American Senate's passage of the Neutrality Act, intending to criticize it after the "final act is over," that is, after the House of Representatives passes it. They claimed, "The Senate's vote is only the first act of the play. No one criticizes it after the play is over. In this situation, the final act of the play is the House of Representatives. At the moment, it is too early to say whether the play is a comedy or a tragedy." They claimed that the Allied radio broadcasts and American newspaper criticisms clearly indicate that the vote is favorable to the Allied side. They felt that the American newspaper's reflection was "interesting," but not very consistent with the speeches of President Roosevelt and Secretary of War Woodring. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Paris - Well-informed sources yesterday congratulated the American Senate on passing the American Neutrality Act, saying that this is the most important development since the outbreak of the European war.

Britain will receive military supplies worth US$14 million. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington - After the Neutrality Act was passed in the Senate, people in Washington speculated about President Roosevelt's possible third term. The outbreak of the European war has divided opinions within the Republican Party. This can be seen by comparing the Senate meeting this time with the last time. Postmaster General Farley is now also supporting Roosevelt's participation in the third election. Moreover, overseas warfare and the development of domestic commerce can also give Roosevelt a great opportunity. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - The Asahi Shimbun reported that Foreign Minister Nomura's talks with American Ambassador Grew are likely to open in the middle of next week. These talks will relate to the handling of the China Incident and the drafting of a revision of the Japanese-American treaty to replace the old treaty of 1911. The newspaper strongly stated that these talks have special and important significance because they will be a direct result of Japan's main policy. Japan's main policy is to complete its ultimate goal of resolving the China Incident. When the Abe Cabinet was established, it clearly announced that its most important policy was to proceed with resolving the China Incident. We may say that the future Japanese-American talks will be the first concrete expression of Japan's attitude in the diplomatic field. The significance of these talks seems far more important than the recent British-Japanese talks, because the latter occurred directly due to the Tianjin British Concession incident and were convened at the request of the British side. The newspaper also expected that general issues such as American interests in China and navigation on the Yangtze River and the Pearl River will be discussed in the Japanese-American talks. The newspaper continued, Foreign Minister Nomura and American Ambassador Grew seem to be proceeding with talks on various fundamental events. If necessary, it may be possible to establish a technical committee. As for whether the issue of the situation in China or the revision of the commercial treaty will be brought up first, it has not yet been decided. It will largely depend on the situation and the environment. At present, there has been no concrete expression of the United States' true intentions, so it is difficult to guarantee optimism about the future. However, the progress of the Japanese-American talks is currently attracting widespread attention because the progress of efforts to resolve the China Incident will depend on the progress of these talks. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to today's newspaper reports, Japanese Special Envoy to China Kato, who is traveling to China and is currently in Kyoto, has received instructions to return to Tokyo, apparently to assist in completing the preparation for future Japanese-American talks. It is expected that Kato will arrive here from Kyoto this afternoon. It is heard that he told visiting reporters that he had not heard anything about the proposed talks. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Italy - Current Policy - Italy Has the Right to Speak on Any European Issue</h3>
<p>Rome - The Telegrafo, which has close ties with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published an article yesterday, the 18th anniversary of the Fascist Party's march on Rome, explaining Italy's current policy. It stated, "Although the situation is extremely uneasy, one thing is certain: no decision on any European issue can be made unless Italy, led by Prime Minister Mussolini, speaks at the appropriate time. The current war is caused by a conflict of interests between several empires. This is the first time that Italy has encountered such a war since unification. It should act with the demeanor of a great power and act entirely in accordance with its own interests. It will never be swayed by foreign diplomacy or foreign ideas. Whether it is a difficult war or an unfair peace, we have experienced the League of Nations' fraud and its sanctions, and have received 20 years of Fascist training, so we will not be swayed by any propaganda movement. In short, the policy promoted by the leaders of Italy is a national policy, and only a national policy," etc. (Havas News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>Rome - Mussolini held an opening ceremony today for the new meeting room of the Legislative Committee, which is one of the celebrations for the anniversary of the Fascist Revolution. The new meeting room was built to expand the Senate. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

The Ambassador attended a welcome banquet held by the British community tonight and will attend a banquet held by Japanese leaders on Tuesday, before returning to Tokyo. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Jewelry - Sold at Auction in New York - To Aid Chinese Refugees</h3>
<p>New York - After Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, the wife of the President of the Chinese Nationalist Party, launched a fundraising campaign for the country's refugees, prominent women from social and political circles here, under the leadership of Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt (the daughter-in-law of the late President Roosevelt), collected Chinese jewelry and sold it publicly, and used the proceeds as donations. The ornaments were sold at the famous Lord &amp; Taylor department store. On the first day, they sold US$7,000 worth. After deducting the commission paid to the department store, the remainder was remitted to China. Mrs. Roosevelt also took the lead and personally purchased a large number of ornaments. Famous ladies in the city were also very enthusiastic about purchasing them. Famous Chinese writer Lin Yutang's wife, Brazilian celebrity dancer Miss Miranda, famous American left-wing writer Mrs. Thompson, and many female leaders were all present to help. These ornaments will be sold indefinitely at Lord &amp; Taylor department store. At the same time, it is planned to do the same across the country. On the one hand, it promotes Chinese ornaments, and on the other hand, it helps Chinese refugees. (Havas News Agency, 29th)</p>

<h3>The Severity of the Hebei Province Flood</h3>
<p>Japanese Hopes for High Cotton Yields Completely Destroyed; Millions of People in the Disaster Area Are Destined to Starve to Death</p>
<p>A Northern China dispatch from the "China Mail" dated October 18th states: Much has been heard regarding the immense losses and suffering endured by Tianjin due to this year's floods, however, news regarding the impact of these floods on other parts of Hebei province has been scarce. The general public may not realize that nearly</p>
<p>Ten Million People</p>
<p>are on the verge of starvation. The accumulated water in Tianjin has already been pumped out, but vast areas in central and southern Hebei province remain submerged. Many towns and villages are indeed still underwater. One consequence of this is the complete cessation of military operations in these areas. Japanese troops, finding it difficult to maintain unobstructed transportation, have mostly withdrawn, while the supply of food to Chinese guerrillas is also dwindling. The unfortunate populace, already endangered by the war, is now destined to starve. According to recent visitors from the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the countryside west of the railway line, as far as the eye can see,</p>
<p>Resembles a Vast Marsh</p>
<p>with only the houses of villages on higher ground still visible above the water, like islands in the sea. The autumn harvest, as well as the renowned cotton that the Japanese had high hopes for, has been completely destroyed. The people of southern Hebei are subsisting on tree roots and leaves to prolong their lives. The signs of disaster are already apparent. An American church has conducted a</p>
<p>Statistical Survey</p>
<p>in several areas southeast of Baoding. Li County was flooded after the dike broke on July 12th, and about one-fifth of the area remains submerged. Of the 224 villages in the county, 200 are still underwater. The autumn harvest is completely hopeless, and 15,000 people are displaced. Gaoyang was flooded on the same day. Of the 100 villages in the area, only 40 are now free of water, and 8,000 people are homeless. According to news from the Xian County church, the residents of 380 villages in the area are completely out of food. To provide them with even the cheapest grains would cost 57,000 yuan per day, illustrating</p>
<p>The Magnitude of the Disaster</p>
<p>Even a glimpse of the countryside reveals that large portions remain flooded. Naturally, winter wheat cannot be planted. Therefore, even next spring, the unfortunate villagers will have no hope of escaping the famine. Furthermore, the drainage system in North China is extremely poor. Unless strenuous efforts are made to drain the accumulated water using special methods and to dredge the mouth of the Hai River in Tianjin, the accumulated water on the land may not recede completely before the summer rains arrive next year. Thus, another season's harvest will also be hopeless, and the famine will last at least</p>
<p>Two Years</p>
<p>To date, it seems that no general measures have been taken to address this massive disaster. Several tens of thousands of yuan have been allocated to the suburbs of Tianjin to procure food and distribute it to the poor, but this is merely a drop in the bucket and does little to help. In a few areas of central Hebei, men from various villages are being forced into labor to repair roads or destroy them to build irrigation ditches, according to the views of the authorities then in control of the area. There are also plans to build dikes and roads, but they have not been implemented. For various reasons, the authorities are not allowing grains to be transported from areas not affected by the flood to areas at risk of famine. It is said that the Japanese military authorities do not view the flood purely as a disaster, as it has forced guerrillas in Hebei province to relocate.</p>
<h3>A Wartime Account of the Battle of Dongshan in Southern Fujian</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Mistakenly Listen to Reports from Traitors and Act Rashly; Three Attacks Fail with Heavy Casualties</p>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence: Since occupying Xiamen, the Japanese army has established a "Naval Base Command Headquarters." The so-called "base" is where Japanese naval ships, boats, planes, and marines gather and depart to invade and harass the coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian. Therefore, all battles in various parts of Fujian and Guangdong are related to the movements of the Japanese army in Xiamen. The Battle of Dongshan is no exception. I will now recount what I know.</p>
<p>On the morning of August 12th, a smuggling boat from Dongshan unloaded smuggled goods to the Xiamen "Materials Association." The boatman, XXX, staggered to the private residence of Zhang Congming, a special agent of the puppet police headquarters, and reported to Zhang Congming that he had contacted influential local bullies in more than 30 villages in Dongshan, who could mobilize more than 100 people as internal collaborators. If firearms could be transported in and supplied to them soon, they could disarm the garrison troops and provide a detailed account of the strength of the garrison troops and local militia and their deployment locations. Zhang was overjoyed upon hearing this and invited him to a meal. In the evening, under the guise of a puppet police department meeting, he brought the boatman along and reported directly to 囗囗囗囗, a special commissioner dispatched by the Xiamen Special Affairs Agency of the Japanese Taiwan Governor-General. 囗囗囗囗 agreed to consult with the command headquarters and consider allocating some firearms to transport and resupply them, instructing him to conduct a thorough investigation and report at any time. After the matter was successful, there would be a generous reward. Thereupon, the boatman returned to Dongshan. Several days later, 囗囗囗囗 indeed used several smuggling boats to transport more than a dozen rifles and ammunition to him, but it still did not satisfy the desires of the so-called "bullies." 囗囗囗 was also very displeased, but feeling powerless, he told the smugglers that if everyone could do their best to raise funds, there was no need to worry about not having guns or money when the time came. Therefore, he consulted with the chief of the Xiamen Liaison Department of the Japanese Asia Development Board, 囗囗囗囗. Although 囗囗 still had many doubts, he insisted that the internal collaborators he had secured would definitely have a way. 囗囗 then reported to Tokyo, and it was decided to proceed on the 25th. 囗, still afraid that the naval commander 囗囗囗口 would not trust him, lured him with the promise that he had absolute certainty and could capture the area without losing a single soldier. 囗囗 was moved by this and ordered the Sotabe Unit to set off with the ships and gather more than 30 small boats between Xiamen and Gulangyu to transport them all together. This was on the night of the 22nd. 囗囗囗 himself thought victory was in his grasp and invited the military attache Oohashi to go along, intending that he himself could command the Han traitor internal collaborators, and Oohashi could land to pacify the population. On the 23rd, Sotabe, eager for success, moved the ships to Chen Port at noon and put down the 30 or so small boats they had transported, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, and forcibly landed. The ships also fired cannons to assist in the assault. At that time, the Chinese garrison troops stationed at Chen Port temporarily retreated under the intense cannon fire. When the commander of the garrison troops, Brigade Commander 囗囗囗, was informed, he dispatched rear units to reinforce while ordering Dongshan County Magistrate Lu to lead the militia to drive them out. Upon receiving the order, County Magistrate Lu dispatched teams to intercept them. The Japanese soldiers who had landed were setting fire to villages near the port when they were suddenly attacked, suffering considerable casualties. The militia, having gained the upper hand, joined forces with the army and fought even more bravely. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Japanese army regrouped and launched a counterattack. At this time, the Chinese army's rear reserve team, because it was more than a hundred li away and the roads had been destroyed, had not yet arrived, so they were attacked again. The militia suffered some sacrifices. At that time, the Japanese army was also apprehensive, so it built fortifications on the occupied territory, and 囗囗囗, seeing that the so-called "bullies" had not provided internal support, was extremely anxious. In addition to Sotabe's cold sneers and sarcasm, he immediately telegraphed Xiamen for reinforcements. At that time, 囗囗 transferred more than 200 soldiers from the Fukushima and Sato Units to assist, attacking the Chinese army's Yancang Covering Camp. The officers and soldiers of the camp calmly resisted and then launched a fierce assault, causing the Japanese army to suffer heavy casualties. On the 25th, the Chinese army transferred the 囗囗 troops to the area. The weather was clear that day, and Japanese planes and ships bombarded the area fiercely, making it difficult to launch a counterattack. On the night of the 27th, they used a courageous posture to slaughter the Japanese soldiers, who were defeated and retreated to the ships. On the 28th, the Japanese army, ashamed and enraged, used 17 planes to cover more than 100 Japanese soldiers in a forced landing, and many Japanese ships also recklessly fired intense cannon fire. The Chinese army temporarily retreated again. That night, Brigade Commander 囗 of the Chinese army personally went to supervise the battle, launching a counterattack at night. Soldiers and civilians were extremely brave, driving the Japanese soldiers into the sea at midnight. On the 29th, the weather was overcast and the wind and rain did not stop, making it impossible for Japanese planes and ships to wreak havoc. Although the Japanese soldiers still tried to land by force, they could not build fortifications, and the elite troops of the Chinese side were also fully assembled, divided and strictly guarded, waiting in battle. By September 2nd, the Japanese soldiers who had landed were being cut down like melons and vegetables. Seeing that the casualties were heavy, the Japanese army collapsed like leaves in the wind and fled back to the ships. At that time, 囗囗囗 lost all morale and dared not speak, and followed the more than 300 corpses of Japanese soldiers who had been transported back in "silent triumph." After the remaining soldiers arrived in Xiamen, in order to cover up the disgrace, they handed over the looted civilian goods and salt to 囗囗 and fabricated wild propaganda in the false reports, but they also admitted that the Chinese army was fierce and numerous. However, those close to 囗囗 and 囗囗 claimed that the Japanese side considered the Battle of Dongshan to be a great disgrace, and the salt obtained was not enough to cover the corpses of the dead soldiers. Therefore, they despised 囗囗囗 and Zhang Congming's gang of little ghosts and recalled the remaining troops, soon transferring them to Taiwan to reorganize.</p>
<h3>The Fujian Provincial Government Suppresses Zhang Xiongnan; Zhang is Dismissed for Illegal Activities in His Defense Zone; Government Troops are Now Advancing on Three Sides</h3>
<p>Fuzhou correspondence: Zhang Xiongnan, the leader of the southern Fujian militia, returned to Fujian from Hong Kong last summer. The authorities appointed him as the brigade commander of the 4th Security Brigade, recruiting and appeasing various militia groups and forming three regiments, stationed in the counties of Tiaohua, Xianyou, Yongtai, Yongchun, and Datian. After taking office, Zhang immediately tempted strong young men to join the brigade in order to evade military service, and forced farmers to plant tobacco seedlings in the defense zone, collecting taxes. The provincial government received repeated accusations from various parties, and in April of this year, dismissed him from his position as brigade commander and transferred him to serve as a councilor in the provincial government. Unexpectedly, Zhang not only refused to leave the team and go to the provincial government to take office, but also incited his subordinates to act freely, disobeying orders. The provincial government then dismissed him on September 20th and ordered his suppression, sending Huang Zhenwu, the director of the Security Department, as the commander of the Fujian Central Suppression of Bandits, Liang Weizhuo, the brigade commander of the 3rd Security Brigade, as the commander, and Wang Menggu, the administrative commissioner of the 4th District, as the deputy commander, and mobilizing troops to advance on various routes to suppress them. Zhang's troops occupied the border area of the four counties of Xian, Yong, De, and Da, gathering a crowd to resist and colluding with the X faction to cause trouble in the rear of Fujian, establishing a radio station to communicate privately with Shanghai, Hong Kong, Xiamen, and Shantou. In addition to announcing that the officers and soldiers of Zhang's troops should quickly wake up, abandon the rebellious troops, and be allowed to return to their hometowns and live in peace, the bandit suppression command headquarters also sealed off the bandit areas to cut off their military supplies. All mountains and forests around the bandit area that hindered military operations were cut down, and the fields and rice paddies in the adjacent areas were mobilized and harvested in advance and moved to other places. People in the bandit area were moved to other villages to live in, implementing a policy of clearing the fields. At the same time, troops advanced from Xianyou, Yongchun, and Dehua in three routes. Currently, the bandit areas of Zhudi, Cangdou, Puwei, Zhukeng, and other places in Xianyou have been successively recovered. The bandits in this area have no possibility of regrouping. The self-reformed bandits who have returned are taken in by the district office. In Yongchun, battles have occurred in the areas of Daxi, Lengkeng, and Yunban. Zhang's troops once stubbornly resisted, but after the troops launched a brave attack, the bandits suffered considerable casualties and are still being suppressed. The county government also issued announcements to the important towns and villages in the nearby bandit areas, immediately preparing to build bunkers, with each bao constructing at least one squad bunker, and the location of the joint bao office constructing a platoon bunker, guarded by the regular team to prevent the bandits from harassing them. In Dehua, Dehua is Zhang Xiongnan's birthplace, so it is also the place where Zhang's troops have the most influence. The bandit suppression military operations are also the most tense on this route. Zhang's troops once raided the county seat, but were repelled by the troops. Fierce battles have been fought in the areas of Shangzhai, Sanban, and Xueshan northwest of Dehua in recent days. Yesterday, they advanced to Gaoji, near Zhang Xiongnan's old nest in Xishan, and tightly surrounded the place. Zhang is also stubbornly resisting. The bandit suppression troops are advancing from the periphery, and the bandit suppression command headquarters has offered a reward of 10,000 yuan to capture the bandit Zhang. It is also said that the original bases of the bandit troops have been captured by the troops, and the main force of the bandit troops has also been defeated and is disintegrating into small groups, fleeing in various directions, attempting to lie dormant in various places. Special orders have been issued to the counties of Xian, Yong, De, and Da to mobilize lower-level political organs and mobilize the people to organize guard teams and pass on sentry posts to assist in the suppression in order to fundamentally eliminate them.</p>

<h3>First Victory in the First Division League: Donghua Defeats Laox 5-2; 1-1 Tie in the First Half; Solid Defense Leaves the Opponent Helpless</h3>
<p>In the Western Football First Division League, Donghua made its debut yesterday, battling Laox at the Yiyuan Stadium. Although Yang and Liang suddenly left Shanghai for Hong Kong before the match, it did not affect Donghua's overall strength. The defense was exceptionally strong, and the Laox forwards had no room to maneuver. As a result of the fierce battle, Donghua triumphed 5-2. The first half of yesterday's match was a bit lax, resulting in a 1-1 tie, with neither side gaining the upper hand. The crowd numbered nearly three thousand.</p>

<p>Laox kicks off. As soon as the two forwards make contact, they are intercepted by Donghua. Donghua mobilizes its forces and moves forward. Awan tries a shot, going over the crossbar. Favanxiao gets the ball and lofts it high. England shoots a foot wide. Within two minutes, the situation is already in full swing. Just as the audience is focused, Jack unexpectedly makes a long pass, landing right next to the goal. Atig passes it to the center, and England shoots. Qin Bigao is unable to save it, and Donghua suffers a setback within two minutes. At 13 minutes, Mada commits a handball in the penalty area. The audience thinks the time for revenge has arrived, but Ade shoots too centrally, and Katz waves it away. Ade takes another shot, going wide of the goal. In the midst of extreme excitement, Shen Shiyan misses another sure chance. The perversity of fate is evident here. The situation gradually turns around. Donghua takes advantage of the opponent's loose formation. Youliang goes straight down the sideline, passing to the center. Wan Jin heads it in, the ball going into the lower right corner. The score is tied, each side getting one goal. After this, there are still several thrilling moments. At 36 minutes, England rushes into the net, but it is offside. At 43 minutes, Dai Linjing shoots from 40 yards out, but it is not counted because of Wan Xianghua's double offside. The first half ends 1-1.</p>
<p>Continuous Goals</p>
<p>After switching sides, Favanxiao makes two attempts, both extremely dangerous. Qin Bigao rushes out to rescue, and there is no danger. At 10 minutes, Cai Shengmiao takes a free kick from 20 yards out, hitting the goalpost and bouncing down. Wan Jin heads it in, scoring for the second time. Donghua then takes a 2-1 lead. From then on, everything goes smoothly. At 19 minutes, Wan Xianghua dribbles from 40 yards out as if there is no one there, calmly shooting and scoring (3-1). The Laox team loses two goals in a row. The front line is in fierce battle. Atig, with great difficulty, finds a gap and passes to the center. Favanxiao takes a shot, but fails to break through Qin Bigao's agility. Atig takes another shot, but Qin catches it on the ground. At 33 minutes, Shen Shiyan heads it in near the goal, hitting the left corner again (4-1). At 35 minutes, Ajia makes a beautiful cut. Ade shoots from 10 yards out, with no chance of a save (5-1). Donghua has a firm grip on the victory. Wan Jin leaves the field due to injury, but returns briefly. At the last two minutes, Atig shoots high from the edge, floating into the left corner. Donghua finally wins 5-2.</p>
<h3>British Navy Suffers a Crushing Defeat; Lido Triumphs 6-1</h3>
<p>The Lido football team took advantage of the league's empty round yesterday and battled the British Navy team at the Aurora Stadium. At that time, dense clouds covered the sky and a storm was imminent. Although the weather was bad, the crowd was still nearly three thousand. Although the British army gathered the elite of Shanghai, it was difficult to resist Lido's strong defensive line, leaving them no room to maneuver. The number of shots in the entire match could be counted on the fingers. Zheng Tongyu's business was poor, and he could only watch the match. However, Lido did not go too far, and after winning by six goals, it gave the British army a chance to shoot. As a result, the match ended 6-1, with the first half ending 2-0.</p>

<h3>Guangxi Provincial Government: Earnestly Managing Adult Education; Holding a Review Meeting on Adult Education Work</h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) Since the Guangxi Province implemented the Adult Education Year for half a year, due to different environments in various places, the implementation has been inconsistent. In order to seek effective management, the provincial government convened various responsible instructors in August to hold a review meeting on adult education work. Now, based on the results of the review, the "Guangxi Province Implementation of Adult Education Year Improvement Matters" has been formulated and distributed to various counties for management to improve. According to this method, in terms of administration, the National Basic Education Promotion Association in each township, town, village, and street is responsible for promotion, and class teachers are set up, with the village and street chiefs serving as class teachers. Those set up by organs and groups are concurrently held by the person in charge. Regarding admission, in addition to using compulsory methods, more persuasion should be used. For conscription labor, priority should be given to those who have entered adult classes or those who have graduated. Use gatherings and activities, and hold childcare centers to give more opportunities to study. Boatmen, peddlers, and porters who cannot attend classes on time locally must obtain a certificate and attend classes wherever they go. Regarding the curriculum and teaching materials, those who use the "Textbook for Mass Schools" for the national language must teach no less than 40 lessons. Those who use "How the Masses Resist the War" can combine the anti-war speech with the national language for teaching. In terms of teaching and guidance, it is necessary to introduce political training from literacy training to achieve the requirements of strengthening mobilization work. The minimum standard for student graduation has also been revised to: 1. Language application: must fully understand the textbook received, and be able to express opinions at gatherings; 2. Political understanding: must understand and implement the meaning of military service, understand and implement the meaning of national duties, military-civilian cooperation, and anti-war issues, and be able to sing the party song, conscription song, fight Japan, etc.; 3. Life training: must have the habit of being punctual, orderly, clean, and paying attention to hygiene, and be able to use domestic products.

<p>— Qian Yonghe</p>
<p>(7) Enriching Equipment and Teaching Materials: Whether it's nurseries, educational institutions, or orphanages, most are making do with whatever's available. This is the spirit that should be shown during a national crisis, but children are the future masters of the country. We should be frugal with ourselves, but we can't be too calculating when it comes to children. At the very least, children's lives should be simple and plain, with warm clothes, enough to eat, suitable housing, and plenty of play. If a small ancestral hall is crammed with four or five hundred children, and all the rooms are only enough to be used as children's dormitories, even though bedding can be rolled up to serve as classrooms, this situation cannot last for long. In addition, there is a lack of paper and no teaching materials. Relying on the teachers' abilities, they tell stories and current events every day, sing patriotic songs like "My Home is on the Songhua River..." and do some ordinary exercises, going out to the public to do some propaganda against the enemy. The children are growing up day by day, and the war of resistance will end in the blink of an eye. After all, cultivating talent is the price of our suitable education. Everyone has no time to take care of this relationship. In the past, people attached great importance to their children's education. No matter how poor they were, they would pawn their clothes to send their children to excellent schools, and they would not hesitate to pay high fees to enter school. Therefore, when we run child refugee education, we must also have this vision. We should try to save money from other wasteful administrative aspects to enrich the equipment of the various institutions, and speed up the enrichment of teaching materials, so that child refugees can satisfy their nutritional needs of knowledge.</p>
<p>(8) Expand Production Education: According to the implementation plan for the relief and education of child refugees during the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, special attention should be paid to imparting life skills to older children, focusing on farming, small handicrafts, store cooperation, or household training. The Relief Committee has invited experts to formulate various implementation measures for child refugee production education, so that each institution can refer to and implement them. As long as each institution considers the possibilities of the environment, the needs of the society, and the level of the children, and earnestly implements production education, starting with self-sufficiency, such as sewing, cooking, shoemaking, growing vegetables, and bamboo and woodworking, for the purpose of serving the needs of the institution. If there is surplus capacity, then expand to supply nearby villages. Each institution should set a central production task, and the equipment, technology, and products should be better than other institutions. This way, children can learn a skill for self-sufficiency, while also saving on consumption within the institution and increasing production in the rear. The above-mentioned improvement methods are very common. It is hoped that at the beginning of the third year of the War of Resistance, all child refugee relief and education organizations or groups will review their past experiences, try to reduce difficulties, simplify administration, standardize personnel, rationalize education, and all comrades who are engaged in the cause of child refugee relief and education will closely connect, work hard together, jointly study the key problems, and methods of improvement, establish the foundation of a new education in a great era, to cultivate the seedlings of the people and train the vital forces for national reconstruction.

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Orders Counties and Schools to Move to Rural Areas to Start School to Avoid Disasters</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, in view of the uneasy state of towns in Jinhua, Quzhou, Yanzhou, Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing prefectures in eastern Zhejiang, felt very serious and affected the education cause. It had previously issued a notice to the education authorities of various counties to actively prepare to move schools at all levels in urban areas to nearby rural areas under the counties to continue school. However, a few schools have not been able to comply with the order due to various difficulties. Therefore, the Department of Education has recently issued another order to urge all schools to quickly comply with the previous order to avoid disasters.</p>

<h3>France's War Economic Strength and Its Application</h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>France's Weakness</p>
<p>Insufficient human resources are one of the weaknesses of France's war capability. The number of adult men who are most useful for war is also less than in other countries. Regardless of the efforts of the French government authorities to remedy this weakness, they are working hard to address population policies: such as the repeated issuance of national birth subsidies, childcare allowances, and increased housewife allowances in mid-July last year, preventing the concentration of young people in cities, facilitating marriage matchmaking, and improving the treatment of illegitimate children, etc. However, it is still unable to have any impact on the number of men who can be mobilized today.</p>
<p>Composition of adult men in major powers (unit: thousand people)</p>
<p>Year Total Population Men (15-49 years old) Men as % of Total</p>
<p>France 1936 41,300 9,870 49.6</p>
<p>UK 1937 46,008 11,872 53.7</p>
<p>US 1935 127,341 34,398 53.6</p>
<p>Germany 1938 74,827 19,645 53.9</p>
<p>Italy 1936 42,918 10,378 48.8</p>
<p>USSR 1936 147,028 34,937 49.2</p>
<p>Japan 1935 69,254 16,889 48.6</p>
<p>(Note) According to the 1938-39 League of Nations Yearbook, the Soviet Union is based on a census.</p>
<p>As shown in the table on the right: The number of men aged 15 to 49 in France is only 9.87 million, the fewest among all countries. Therefore, the number of men who can serve as regular troops, from the age of 20 to 24 who were born during the European War, is only 1.52 million in France, 4.23 million in the United Kingdom, and 5.15 million in Germany, including the Czech Republic. Therefore, the combined strength of Britain and France is only slightly better than Germany.</p>
<p>Dependence on Colonies</p>
<p>The importance of colonies to France lies not only in the replenishment of personnel resources, but also in the replenishment of material resources. Therefore, its relationship is extremely important.</p>
<p>In recent years, France's dependence on colonies is as follows:</p>
<p>France's Dependence on Colonies (%)</p>
<p>1935 1937 1938</p>
<p>Colonies account for % of total imports 25.8 24.4 27.1</p>
<p>% of total exports to colonies 31.5 28.3 27.4</p>
<p>Colonies account for % of total trade 28.2 27.2 27.2</p>
<p>Among the colonies, the status of North Africa is particularly important, accounting for nearly three-fifths of the total colonial trade; among them, the relationship with Algeria is particularly close.</p>
<p>In terms of trade products: in 1938, food accounted for 73.6% of the total food imports from colonies, while only 33.7% of the food exports from the country were to colonies, and 66.3% were to other countries.</p>
<p>As for the export of raw materials, non-colonies account for 88.7% of France's total raw material trade, while colonies only account for 11.3%, which is different from the above situation.</p>
<p>Of the total exports of finished products, colonies account for 35.4%, while imports only account for 2.8%.</p>
<p>In other words: Most of the raw materials that account for a large proportion of France's imports come from foreign countries. The next largest is food, which mostly comes from colonies, so colonies are actually the food supply base for France.</p>
<p>France's food self-sufficiency rate is said to be 83%. After imports from colonies, it can achieve 100% self-sufficiency. Therefore, in the current war, it will definitely work hard to achieve it!</p>
<p>Colonies and Industrial Raw Materials</p>
<p>It is not as easy to import and develop industrial raw materials from colonies as it is with food. For example, the anthracite coal in Tonkin, Indochina, is indeed of excellent quality; but because the freight is expensive, it has always only been imported in 17,000 tons. In the future, due to the cessation of imports of German and Polish coal, it will only be possible to risk the danger of maritime transport and use it as much as possible.</p>
<p>The production capacity of rubber in Indochina was 59,000 tons last year; if developed, it can be increased to 100,000 tons in three years. Although France is usually self-sufficient in rubber; but during wartime, due to the surge in demand, it will inevitably be insufficient.</p>
<p>The phosphate produced in Morocco, Algeria, and Georgia in North Africa reaches 4 million tons per year. In 1938, it not only exported 761,000 tons to the country; it also exported 1,833,000 tons to Britain, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries.</p>
<p>Various parts of North Africa are also rich in lead, zinc, iron ore, manganese, cobalt and other important materials; but the lack of oil is a major regret!</p>
<p>Guinea and West Africa both produce gold. The gold mine in Guinea is particularly famous. Its reserves are estimated to be 400 billion francs. However, due to climate, transportation, and insufficient manpower, mining is very difficult.</p>
<p>The cotton production increase plan is currently being carried out in the Terta region of the lower Niger River in Guinea, using local hydropower to cultivate 800,000 hectares of land, which is enough to supply one-third of France's total cotton needs. This project is scheduled to be completed in 1941. Last year, France's total cotton imports were 2 billion francs, of which 35% came from colonies; the achievement is still far away. Therefore, the effect of developing colonies and using their raw materials is minimal.</p>
<p>The Key to War Implementation Capability</p>
<p>The consumption of raw materials in modern warfare is indeed as huge as listed in the table below. Therefore, the difficulty for France to conduct a long-term war lies in obtaining raw materials.</p>
<p>Raw Material Consumption of Different Types of Warfare (Thousands of Tons)</p>
<p>(Note) The numbers are estimated in Paul Sosthene's book "Future War". It refers to the amount of raw materials required for a war lasting one thousand kilometers and a combat period of one year. The production figures for 1938 are based on the 1938-39 League of Nations Yearbook.</p>
<p>In terms of the self-sufficiency rate of raw materials, even with colonies included, it is not as abundant as Germany. Therefore, France will maintain its transportation lines to the colonies on the one hand, and obtain raw materials from the colonies. At the same time, it will increase wartime export capacity and import what it needs from the United Kingdom and the United States. However, under the condition of insufficient human resources, and the need for huge forces to carry out a full-scale offensive against the Siegfried Line; the difficulties are not easy to solve. For this reason, it is necessary to adopt a naval blockade strategy to wait for Germany to fall into a period of exhaustion. However, the pressure of increasing raw material consumption cannot be reduced by this. Therefore, the key to implementing France's war economy will lie in how to fully utilize and heighten domestic military production capacity, and how to equip the ability for foreign military needs in order to obtain raw materials?

<h3>Conversion of American and Indian Cotton into Legal Tender</h3>
<p>— Three</p>
<p>Recently, many readers have wanted to understand the calculation method of converting American cotton and Indian cotton into legal tender. I will give a brief explanation of the calculation method of these two types of cotton prices.</p>
<p>According to common business practice, the cotton industry still uses the Sima scale and old dan (a unit of weight). This is the custom, so the following conversion is also calculated using the Sima scale. I will briefly describe it as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Calculation Method of American Cotton: The price of American cotton is calculated in pounds. For example, the New York transaction price for July on October 26 was 861, which means that the price of American cotton per pound in July was 8.61 US cents. To convert the pound unit of American cotton into a Sima scale dan, multiply it by 133. In other words, 133 pounds of American cotton is exactly equal to the price of a Sima scale dan. At the same time, divide it by the Shanghai-US exchange rate of the day. In this way, you can get the price of American cotton converted into legal tender per Sima scale dan:</p>
<p>(2) Calculation Method of Indian Cotton: The unit of Indian cotton is Candy, each "Candy" weighs 784 pounds, which is equivalent to 588 catties in Sima scale, which is equal to the old dan. Now, taking the price of white rock per "Candy" in April and May at the Bombay Cotton Exchange in India on October 26 as 196.75 rupees, and the Shanghai-India exchange rate of 27.5 rupees per 100 yuan yesterday, the total per dan is 121 yuan, 6 jiao, and 7 fen in legal tender. Here is the calculation method:</p>
<p>The above calculation method is very simple, but there is one point that readers should pay special attention to, that is, this price is only the exchange rate of the day's exchange price converted into a legal tender, such as freight, war risk insurance, and tariff interest. If it is shipped, it is necessary to add the difference in the grade of various cottons.</p>
<p>Seeking Answers</p>
<p>Since Mr. Zhang Fangren of Hengyuan Taihua Company raised the issue of foreign cotton conversion, the reporter also had doubts after calculating what he knew. It has been detailed in the previous issue of this journal. Later, I sought advice from China Cotton and was introduced to Mr. Hu's article: I am deeply grateful. However, the price converted into the market dan by this formula still differs by two or three yuan from the price directly converted into the market dan from the American cotton price and the Sima dan price. Based on the above article, the calculation results of each item are listed below, hoping that you will teach me.</p>
<p>Price directly converted from American cotton to one Sima dan (see previous formula)</p>
<p>Price converted from one Sima dan to one market catty dan</p>
<p>Price directly converted from American cotton to one market catty dan (see previous issue of this journal)</p>
<p>Price converted from market catty price to Sima catty</p>
<p>English Cotton Conversion</p>
<p>Mr. Fu Hua Peng Bojia: I have received your letter. The American cotton price is the same as the price of the Liverpool Cotton Exchange. It is the same as the American cotton middling standard. The quotation unit is also pounds, but it is calculated in English pence. Therefore, the conversion method is the same as that of American cotton: but instead of using the American exchange rate, the English exchange rate is used. There is no conclusion yet on the issue of American cotton conversion.</p>
<h3>The Past Week</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued new regulations prohibiting banks and money shops from using gold as collateral for loans and prohibiting pawnshops from accepting gold as pledges. This policy of controlling privately owned gold is absolutely necessary from the perspective of the state. For the people themselves, the loss from selling it to the government is only some ill-gotten wealth. Moreover, it is an undeniable duty to do one's best to donate money. The legal tender was originally divorced from the price of gold and silver; but in the foreign exchange black market where speculators are active, the cash black market and the legal tender still affect each other. Therefore, entering and exiting the cash black market is no different from entering and exiting the foreign exchange black market. The surge in cash prices has led to a decline in black market foreign exchange rates. Therefore, the money earned from the rise in gold prices is secretly consumed by the decline in foreign exchange rates, and there is even the danger of invisible premiums. If friends who buy gold understand the cause and effect, then it is obviously more advantageous to sell it to the government. (One Millet)</p>
<p>In the past, rice prices were expensive due to the manipulation of both supply (sources) and demand (hoarders). Now, bumper harvests have been reported everywhere, and new rice is coming onto the market in a steady stream. At this time, the three branches of the First Special District Citizens' Federation suggested that the concession authorities set up a public association and implement storage, which is the most appropriate thing to do. Because setting up warehouses to store grain can not only prevent the manipulation of hoarders, but also prepare for emergencies. Recently, Sichuan Province announced a bumper harvest, and the Agricultural Bank has formulated a new grain purchase and storage plan for Sichuan, divided into two parts: one is to handle transportation and sales, and the other is to specialize in hoarding and storage, which is clear proof of setting up warehouses to store grain. Although Shanghai is currently in a special environment: if each rice shop can cooperate effectively with the authorities, setting up warehouses to store grain will be easy. If setting up public warehouses is inconvenient in terms of time and economy, it is advisable to rent existing warehouses. (Jiahe)</p>
<p>The foreign exchange black market is extending its losses. This is not because the Chinese authorities are trying to maintain the Shanghai exchange market and gradually increase it to reach a new level before fixing it. Rather, it is because foreign merchants are doing their own trade, the Xiang War and the European War have shattered the hearts of the bulls, the Japanese puppets are plundering local products and need legal tender, overseas Chinese funds are flowing back to the motherland, the credibility of the foreign exchange itself is shaken, and the value of the legal tender is too high compared to the black market, etc., so the market itself needs to adjust itself. At the same time, the general speculators saw that the trend of sucking up was coming to an end, so they dumped foreign exchange, resulting in an oversupply and thus a relaxation. However, we should "enter the trap cautiously," because big speculators often use evil tricks such as "luring the enemy to go deep" to make small speculators sell off one after another, and when the foreign exchange is extended to a considerable extent, they will come back with a set of purchasing activities. If you do not quickly "change course" and invest in production enterprises; then you will always inevitably encounter the misfortune of being manipulated by others. (Fang Yifang)</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: The Gold Market is Watching</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash in this city was weak. As it was a regular Sunday holiday, the situation outside the market was unusually calm. There was no trading heard all day, and the market price was also very stable. According to inquiries at the sales department of money exchange businesses, the selling price was still 3,725 yuan, and the buying price was 3,720 yuan, with little trading. Compared with the previous day's buying price, it was slightly weaker. The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops also remained at the original price. Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang both quoted 375 yuan, with the buying price reduced by 20 yuan to 15 yuan. According to a London telegram on the 28th, British pure gold was still 8 pounds and 8 shillings per ounce.</p>
<h3>Food: Late Season Indica Rice is Even More Scarce, New Japonica Rice Still Feels Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of goods from various places was only more than 3,000 packages transported by wheels. Since the price of late season indica rice rose once after yesterday, the market situation was tight when it opened yesterday. After the rice and grain in Jingwu and other areas were subject to a certain party's implementation of control, it was impossible for rice merchants to transport them to Shanghai. They mostly belonged to the general eastern trade for sales. Therefore, the goods from Jingwu have been stored in warehouses in the Hongkou area after arriving in Shanghai. If you want to purchase them, you must transact with them and then transport them out of the area for resale. Therefore, the general eastern trade in yesterday's market continued to stop selling, and the market inventory was weak, and people's hearts were even stronger. Those who held goods in their hands all regarded them as scarce goods and were unusually eager to bid. At the same time, the general customers saw that there were few chips in the market, and they also took the opportunity to compete to avoid missing out, resulting in high prices one after another as soon as they were inquired about. The closing market was slightly affected by the weakness of other goods and was difficult to fully improve. It only increased by half a jiao compared to the previous market. If the special good-quality late season indica rice from Jiangbei was opened at 23.5 yuan, the market price was 21.23 yuan to 21 yuan. The special good-quality from Wuhu and Nanjing was opened at 21.3 yuan to 19.5 yuan. As for the new japonica rice and the broken japonica rice that looked like yuan, there were more arrivals, and the local shops were not selling well, so it was difficult for the market to improve. They remained at the original price without honor or disgrace, and the situation was weak. The special japonica rice from Changzhou and Wuxi was still 31.5 yuan, the second was 31 yuan to 28.5 yuan, the broken fragrant japonica rice was 30 yuan to 27 yuan, the high japonica rice from Suzhou, Tongzhou, Changzhou, and Kunshan was 30 yuan, the second was 27-28 yuan, the special fragrant japonica rice was 24 yuan, the second was 22 yuan, the special reed japonica rice was 25 yuan, and the second was 23 yuan. The Chen Yuan rice from Changbang was rarely available in the market. Only the Zhongguan goods were opened at 26-27 yuan, and the new white Yuan rice was 26-27 yuan. The green seed kiln seed and Baige and other types of rice were more popular due to the scattered routes of departure, resulting in an oversupply, and the market color was uniquely soft. As a result, the market price decreased by one or two jiao except for the green seed, which remained unchanged. It is estimated that the total turnover of the city was only six or seven thousand packages.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: White Sugar Rises Frequently</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend yesterday was stable, and it appeared to be slightly tighter. The public association's market quotation for spot goods was 54 yuan for No. 24 coarse white sugar in the warehouse, up half a yuan. There was not much fluctuation in the foreign warehouse, at 54 yuan to 4.4 jiao. Re-exported goods were still 43 yuan. Taikoo's white sugar B mark initially rose by half a jiao, to 58 yuan, and then rose to 58.5 yuan, CW mark was 58 yuan, CX mark was 57.5 yuan, DY mark was 56.5 yuan, HX mark was 56 yuan, carmine H mark was 41 yuan, and Dutch carmine was 42.5 yuan. Local refined white sugar followed suit and rose by half a yuan. No. 1 was 54.5 yuan, No. 2 was 54 yuan, No. 3 was 53.5 yuan, and No. 4 was 53 yuan. Local No. 1 crystal ice and bright crystal ice were both at the original price. National sugar was flat and weak, and there was still a lack of continued price openings.</p>

<h3>The False Government Holds Extravagant Hopes for Western Shanghai, Negotiations Look Bleak, Bureau Meeting May Not Discuss, Some Suggestions Rumored to Be Sent Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Regarding the cross-border road construction dispute, after the Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden met with the false mayor Chuan Xiaoan on the evening of the 3rd, the Municipal Council officials discussed a "suggestion outline." Based on this outline, they drafted "concrete measures" as the basis for resolving the dispute between the Council and the false municipal government, so that the two sides could discuss it. After the "suggestion outline" was decided, Fessenden presented it during his second meeting with Chuan Xiaoan on the evening of the 6th. However, it is said that Chuan did not agree to it. As for the "concrete measures" drafted by the Municipal Council Secretary and Director-General F.C. Fell and the Police Commissioner P.F.F.H. Barry, the reporter of the Da Zhong News Agency learned yesterday that they have also been completed. It is rumored that they will be submitted to the Municipal Council Board of Directors for discussion before being sent to Chuan Xiaoan in writing.</p>
<p>The Bureau Regularly Convenes a Meeting</p>
<p>It is learned that the Municipal Council Board of Directors has scheduled a meeting for 4:30 PM this Wednesday (November 1st). However, regarding whether this case will be discussed, according to a director of the Municipal Council, as of yesterday, the Municipal Council had not notified that the case was on the agenda. It is also possible that it will be discussed through off-site negotiations. The Da Zhong News Agency reporter asked a director whether the meeting negotiations could be considered a Board of Directors discussion. The director stated that as long as the Chairman agrees and the directors understand, it could be established. Therefore, as of last night, there was no definite news. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Municipal Council Secretary Charles Robert Burkill told reporters on the 18th that the Municipal Council is scheduled to hold a Board of Directors meeting at 4:30 PM on November 1st, at which time it will summarize opinions on the "suggestion plan" and general issues of cross-border road construction for important discussion. As for some "suggestions" for the area outside the boundary in western Shanghai, the Bureau has decided to send them to Jiangwan "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan tomorrow.</p>
<p>Divergent Opinions, Difficult to Resolve. Regarding the "suggestion outline," which is the principle for resolving this negotiation, the Municipal Council advocates joint management of the cross-border road construction in western Shanghai by both parties. However, the false "municipal government" insists that it must "comprehensively take over" police and administrative power. Therefore, opinions diverge, and the prospect of negotiation still faces many obstacles. General observers believe that although the Municipal Council has repeatedly expressed concessions, the false government has extremely high expectations, demanding an inch and seeking a mile. It seems not easy to find a compromise solution.</p>
<p>The Attitude of the False Government is Extremely Tough</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoan told a reporter from the Japanese "Continental New News" on Friday afternoon that the Shanghai "Special Municipal Government" should continue to strive to demand the complete transfer of administrative and police powers in the area outside the boundary of western Shanghai from the Municipal Council. The western district of Shanghai belongs to the Chinese side, and the Municipal Council should bear the responsibility for illegally intruding into areas not belonging to the Council. If the Municipal Council does not recognize the demands of the "Special Municipal Government," then he will not accept any suggestions from the Municipal Council. The reporter asked if there were other issues besides these two demands of the "Special Municipal Government" regarding the western Shanghai issue. Chuan replied that there were still issues such as tax collection rights, public utilities, and road maintenance fees. If the Municipal Council accepts these two demands, then the "Special Municipal Government" is willing to resolve these issues amicably. Chuan also revealed that the Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden had suggested that representatives from both the Municipal Council and the "Special Municipal Government" organize a special meeting to jointly manage western Shanghai, with the western district patrolled by an equal number of Municipal Council police and "Special Municipal Government" police. He had rejected Fessenden's suggestion. Fessenden also proposed that if a joint council is established, the Deputy Police Commissioner Yao Huimo should serve as the police chief of the western district. The reporter asked if the rejection of the suggestion would lead to the collapse of the negotiations. Chuan replied that the Council will have new suggestions next week. However, if the Municipal Council does not agree to these two demands, then no matter what suggestions the Council makes, the "Special Municipal Government" will not accept them. He told Fessenden that if Fessenden resolves the issue of roads outside the boundary in western Shanghai, then he will erect a statue of Fessenden in that area.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Safely Pass the End of the Month, All Banks Accommodate Extensions for Due Payments, New Loans Start at Nine Yuan Interest</h3>
<p>With the end of the month approaching for Shanghai industry and commerce, all banks have agreed to accommodate extensions for due payments. Companies, firms, and factories that borrowed have contacted the banks to settle due interest and sign new extension contracts with terms ranging from one to six months. Regarding new long-term credit loans, although the banks have agreed to provide as much as possible, the number of transactions completed is small. The interest rate ranges from nine to twelve yuan. These loans still require solid shop guarantees or guarantors. As for the deposit interest rates of the banks, they are all settled according to the publicly agreed internal market rate of five yuan and five jiao. Regarding the Shanghai financial market, after the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture provided rediscounting and the silver and money industries adjusted their reserve treasury, each bank's own reserves have become increasingly sufficient. There is no sign of a tight money situation, and the market is exceptionally stable. There is absolutely no problem for various industries to safely pass the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Regular Chinese Troops Have Arrived in Northern Shanghai, Densely Deployed in Zhabei, Wusong, and Kunshan Areas, Controlling Certain Key Locations at Any Time When Necessary</h3>
<p>In recent days, along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines and in the suburbs of Shanghai, mobile units of Chinese troops have been exceptionally active, launching surprise attacks from time to time, posing a serious threat to the Japanese and puppet forces. According to a person from Jiangwan who spoke to a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency yesterday, many regular Chinese troops have recently arrived in the area from Zhabei and Wusong to Kunshan. Several thousand troops have gathered in certain areas, fully equipped with all military equipment, and can control certain key locations at any time when necessary, and annihilate the places where the Japanese and puppet troops are gathered. It was secretly reported by the Japanese side yesterday that more than a thousand Japanese and puppet troops had been dispatched to the Jiangwan area and fired artillery to warn the Chinese troops. However, the Chinese troops ignored it. It is said that a certain unit of the Chinese side has established close contact with various friendly forces, and various outposts have penetrated deep into the Japanese military defense zone. The Japanese side witnessed the situation and was extremely panicked. They are now secretly deploying Wusong, the Lion Forest, and the central area of Jiangwan into a state of wartime, firing sporadic shots every night in an attempt to prevent Chinese troops from attacking at night. The Japanese troops on the Mount Seller side are now trapped in the city. They open the city gates and post sentries during the day, but close the gates at night and do not come out. Several sentry posts have been attacked by Chinese troops, but they have vented their anger on innocent residents, arresting or shooting them. It is reported that the Japanese troops in the Jia district north of Suzhou Creek suddenly became tense yesterday, and strictly inspected pedestrians coming and going through the gaps, which is also related to this.</p>
<h3>Dharma Master Yuan Ying Was Taken to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Forced to preside over the Sino-Japanese Buddhist Association, the lives of the faithful should be safe</p>
<p>Dharma Master Yuan Ying, President of the Buddhist Association of China, was kidnapped at noon on the 19th of this month by plainclothes Japanese personnel in a car at Yuanying Lecture Hall, No. 50, Dingpan Road, west of Shanghai, and sped away. His whereabouts have been unknown ever since. Buddhists and people from all walks of life in Shanghai are quite concerned. It was later learned that Yuan Ying was detained after being arrested and taken to a military headquarters in Jiangwan. Although various parties tried to rescue him, he has not been released. According to a Da Guang News Agency reporter who inquired with relevant parties, Dharma Master Yuan Ying was escorted to Nanjing three days ago. This shows that the Japanese side arrested Yuan Ying purely to coerce him into presiding over the affairs of the Sino-Japanese Buddhist Association. Before this, the Japanese side had repeatedly sent personnel to contact Yuan Ying, but all were rejected. Therefore, they resorted to this coercive measure to implement threats.</p>
<h3>Restriction on Female Postal Workers, Shanghai Women's Circles Strive for Justice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, they received the press to uphold justice, using facts to prove the ability of female postal workers</p>
<p>The Kunming Postal Administration provisionally stipulated four measures for employing female postal workers on September 18th of this year, which caused dissatisfaction among women's circles in this city. In addition to repeatedly telegraphing Director Guo of the General Bureau to withdraw the order, at 3:00 PM yesterday, at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road, twelve women's organizations, including the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association, the Shanghai Women's Society, and the Chinese Professional Women's Club, jointly hosted reporters from this city. Representatives from various organizations, Mao Liying, Zhu Libo, Jiang Ping, etc., and reporters from various newspapers, totaling more than 30 people, elected Zhu Libo as the temporary chairman to report on the process of the post office's regulations on employing female employees and to ask the media to uphold justice and provide assistance. The reporters from various newspapers then contributed their opinions, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. Here is an excerpt from the general outline of the letter from all female employees in the Shanghai postal area and all female employees from Jiangsu Province staying in Shanghai to the women of the country regarding the restrictions on the post office's recruitment of female employees.</p>
<p>A Matter Concerning the Occupational Future of Women</p>
<p>To the women of the country: In recent years, with the rise of the War of Resistance, the country is at a critical juncture. The way to victory lies only in gathering the strength of the people of the whole country for the country's use. Our supreme leader has repeatedly instructed the people to mobilize all the human and material resources of the country to strive for the final victory. Women also belong to the people. Where their responsibilities lie, they should do their best to contribute to the country and should not give up their duties. However, the authorities, when recruiting junior postal workers in the previous session, used the excuse that it was inconvenient to transfer women and planned not to recruit women from outside for the time being. When this matter was discovered by colleagues, because it concerned the entire occupational future of women, they did not dare to remain silent, assuming that the matter did not involve them. On the "March 8" Women's Day, representatives were elected to request the director to withdraw the proposal. At the same time, they requested the postal union to send a letter to the Post Office General Administration to negotiate. Fortunately, the Post Office General Administration approved the recruitment regardless of gender. The colleagues were fortunate to have the Post Office General Administration's wisdom. Unexpectedly, when recruiting junior postal workers in this session, the authorities claimed to have received an order from the Post Office General Administration that the examination was limited to men, and even went further, not even allowing female postal assistants in the bureau to participate. Although they repeatedly requested the withdrawal of the order, they were not approved.</p>
<p>Restrictions on the Recruitment of Female Employees</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, they were notified by the General Administration's General Telecommunication No. 735 that the collection and delivery of parcels and transportation work were not suitable for women. Therefore, with the approval of the Ministry of Communications, four measures were provisionally stipulated to restrict the recruitment of female employees: (1) The recruitment of female employees in each postal area is limited to the Administration and first-class bureaus. (2) The number of female employees in each Administration and its subordinate first-class bureaus shall not exceed 5% of the total number of personnel in each area. (3) Married women are not allowed to apply for the exam. (4) Those who get married after joining the bureau will be dismissed when they are about to get married, depriving us of the rights we should enjoy and blocking our service path. This matter concerns the entire occupational problem of women. The colleagues are at the forefront and dare not remain silent. They are willing to present it in detail to the women of the country.</p>
<p>The Working Ability of Female Postal Workers</p>
<p>(1) This time, the Shanghai Post Office does not allow women to apply for the exam, using the excuse that it is inconvenient to transfer them. However, among the personnel recruited in the previous exam by the bureau, the percentage of women who should be transferred to the southwest to serve is higher than that of men, which is the most powerful evidence that female employees are not inconvenient to transfer. (2) The restriction on the recruitment of female employees uses the excuse that post office affairs, such as collecting and delivering parcels and transporting mail, are not suitable for women. Not to mention that the personnel in the post office who collect and deliver parcels and transport mail account for only one-tenth of the total personnel. Furthermore, it is the subjective view of a small number of narrow-minded people that women are not suitable for such work, without any factual evidence. Calling it arbitrary, who says it is not suitable? (3) The post office has a history of employing female employees for nearly ten years. During this period, female employees have worked hard and have never lagged behind. They are diligent and brave, and always faithful. The post office's performance evaluation has always been strict. According to the records, no one has been punished or dismissed due to poor work performance or mistakes. As for work efficiency, according to the performance reports, it is not inferior to male employees. The facts are all there and cannot be erased, and should not be discriminated against by certain people using pretexts. (4) According to the restriction on the recruitment of female employees, married women are not allowed to apply for the exam, and those who get married after joining the bureau will be dismissed when they are about to get married. The intention is that women should be unemployed after marriage. If they want to keep their jobs, they should remain single. In fact, the work efficiency of married women is not inferior to that of unmarried women. This can be verified by the employee performance reports of the post office. Although married female employees have to take maternity leave during childbirth, from the standpoint of humanity and the survival of the people, it cannot be considered a loss. Furthermore, the burden of women after marriage will be heavier than before marriage. If they are made unemployed, how can it be considered fair?</p>
<p>Pledging to Strive to Achieve the Goal</p>
<p>The colleagues will pledge to strive to ensure that the authorities revoke this contemptuous measure against women and will not rest until the goal is achieved. In addition to telegraphing the National Political Council and the Ministry of Communications to appeal for the protection of women's rights and uphold justice, and requesting the local postal union to forward it to the National Postal Workers' General Union to request the Kunming Postal Administration to revoke General Telecommunication No. 735 and Semi-Official Letter No. 132 (this semi-official letter refers to the fact that female employees serving in the bureau can be dismissed at any time if they are incompetent), we also ask the female compatriots of the whole country to rise up and fight hard, and the enlightened people in the country to provide assistance, so that the unequal measures of the postal bureau's restriction on the recruitment of female employees can be smoothly resolved.</p>
<h3>The Defense of the Gap in North Jiangxi Road Suddenly Became Tense Yesterday</h3>
<p>Detained If Questioned with Slight Hesitation, Japanese Soldiers Prowling Inside the Wire Mesh</p>
<p>The situation in Jia district north of Suzhou Creek was filled with a tense atmosphere yesterday. The Japanese sentry posts at the two gaps in the wire mesh on the east side of North Jiangxi Road leading to Wenjian Shi Road and Haining Road suddenly strictly checked pedestrians starting at 8:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Strictly Checking Pedestrians</p>
<p>Those who were questioned were immediately detained inside the gap and released after a long time. The body searches were also particularly strict. Residents regard entering and exiting the gaps as a fearful experience. On the east side of North Jiangxi Road inside the wire mesh, many Japanese soldiers were patrolling and inspecting the wire mesh at any time, as if to prevent anyone from crossing through the sparse areas of the wire mesh. From North Jiangxi Road to North Henan Road, recently,</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Patrol Frequently</p>
<p>At the same time, police officers from the police station also patrolled in the area from time to time, so the defense was quite thorough. The target range and the municipal houses leaning against the north side were originally piled with many sandbags, but now they have been removed by Japanese-hired workers. From the end of North Jiangxi Road at the north end to North Henan Road, there are no traces of Japanese soldiers. At the iron gate next to the end of North Henan Road and the intersection of Haining Road, British troops are stationed as usual.</p>
<h3>Storing Grain is Under Consideration</h3>
<p>Agreeing on Both Temporary and Permanent Solutions, Various Trade Associations Support Grain Storage</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement and the French Municipal Council of the French Concession yesterday, suggesting that at this time when new grains are entering the market, a large amount of national rice should be purchased and transported from the producing areas and stored in public warehouses within the concessions to meet unforeseen needs, so that rice prices can continue to fall, which will greatly benefit the citizens. The authorities of the two concessions are still considering this suggestion and will submit it to the Grain Management Committee for review before responding or handling it. It is also learned that various trade associations in this city have expressed their support for the grain storage suggestion and will continue to urge the concession authorities to adopt and implement it. According to the person in charge of the Citizens' Federation, the purchase and storage of grain is currently only a suggestion in principle to the concession authorities. Since this matter is urgent and important, there should be a thorough and feasible implementation plan to put it into practice quickly. This certainly requires careful consideration by the concession authorities, but people from all walks of life can also provide as many opinions as possible. The association is happy to convey opinions regarding issues such as purchasing grain, providing funds, and storage issues.</p>
<p>The Occupied Huacheng Tobacco Factory Manufacturing Counterfeit Cigarettes</p>
<p>The Huacheng Tobacco Company Manufacturing Factory on Beck Road in Hongkou, this city, has been completely occupied by the Japanese army since the Shanghai war. This year, it was changed to "East Asia Tobacco Company" by a certain party, and all the remaining machines were taken as its own. A reporter from the Da Guang News Agency learned from relevant parties yesterday that all the products of the East Asia Tobacco Company recently are counterfeit famous cigarettes from various Chinese and foreign tobacco factories. The daily production volume is quite large, most of which are sold to various occupied areas, and a small number are sold to the Shanghai market. Its prices are reduced to half of the products of various factories. Many are unwilling to sell the counterfeit Red Tin Pack, Great Front Door, Three Gunboats, and other tobacco silks produced because the materials are not pure.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Armored Vehicles Search Pedestrians</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department dispatched a team of Chinese and Western detectives and an armored vehicle No. 7 at 11:00 AM yesterday to strictly search pedestrians at the intersection of Great World and Avenue Edward VII for one hour. At the same time, armored vehicles full of detectives were sent to the Tai Niu Bridge vegetable market and Xujiahui and other places to search separately. At 3:00 PM, a police car No. 22 was dispatched and stationed in front of the Great World. It is reported that the police department will intensify its work during this winter defense period by conducting such pedestrian searches.</p>
<h3>Vegetables Transported from the Countryside to Shanghai are Forced to be Bought at Reduced Prices by the Japanese</h3>
<p>The False Vegetable Market Has Not Yet Been Established, Pudong Vegetable Vendors Have Already Suffered Significant Losses</p>
<p>The long-rumored Japanese control of Shanghai's vegetables has gradually become a reality. It is said that the person in charge is a Chinese translator from the Japanese Maritime Gendarmerie. Now, most of the vegetables transported from Pudong to Shanghai every day are intercepted in Hongkou. The general vegetable merchants and vegetable vendors are all suffering greatly. The Da Zhong News Agency will record the details below.</p>
<p>Intercepting Vegetables</p>
<p>Every morning, vegetable merchants and vegetable vendors in Shanghai transport vegetables from Pudong and other places to the concessions, with forty to fifty civilian ships, mainly carrying water chestnuts, ginger, and sweet potatoes, supplying the vegetable needs of the citizens of Shanghai. Since the 17th of this month, vegetable boats coming to Shanghai have been intercepted at the Wusong Road Wharf (also known as Touba) in Hongkou, accounting for about three to four tenths of Shanghai's vegetables. After the vegetables were intercepted and landed at the Wusong Road Wharf, they were all forcibly bought at low prices by the Japanese side, and then resold by the Japanese side to the vegetable market. In one transaction, they can profit</p>
<p>Deceiving the Villagers</p>
<p>Thousands of yuan every day. As for the general vegetable-selling villagers, when they drove their vegetable boats to the Wusong Road Wharf, they were also detained by the Japanese side and forced to put their fingerprints on the already filled-in "voluntary investment" certificate. When the villagers asked why, they replied that this would allow them to obtain permits to travel to various places. However, once they put their fingerprints on it, the vegetables on a boat are equivalent to admitting that they are willing to be bought by the Japanese side. The so-called obtaining permits is all a lie.</p>
<p>Someone Encourages</p>
<p>According to a leader of vegetable vendors, the above-mentioned incident was not intended by the Japanese side at first. The reason is that someone serving as a translator in the Japanese Maritime Gendarmerie encouraged the Japanese side. The head of the Japanese Maritime Gendarmerie then gave him a card, and he held this card to intercept vegetable boats on the Huangpu River to the Yamazaki Barracks Vegetable Collection Station in the Wusong Road Wharf. He threatened and lured them, and would not stop until the intercepted vegetables were bought at low prices. The day before yesterday morning, several ginger boats carrying dozens of loads of ginger had unloaded their cargo at the Lilibai Ferry Bridge. After being discovered, they were forced to be detained in Hongkou and bought at reduced prices.</p>
<p>Merchant Losses</p>
<p>The general merchants who had taken their own money to Pudong to purchase goods and load them on boats to Shanghai not only had no goods to supply the market after being intercepted and forced to buy, but also lost 20% of their capital. The general vegetable-selling villagers suffered such huge losses, and they all cried out in pain. The previous rumor that the Japanese intended to set up a "Vegetable Market" in the Four Banks Warehouse in Zhabei to control Shanghai's vegetables is another matter. However, the scale of the "Vegetable Market" is very large and cannot be established in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs Patrol Ships Have Not Yet Been Released, Two Grain Transport Ships Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Although the Japanese side returned a Jianghai Customs patrol ship two months ago, the whereabouts of the remaining ships are still unknown. Recently, the two grain transport ships Haiguang and Liuxing returned to the Huangpu River yesterday one after another after completing the delivery of food and oil to the lighthouse. In addition, the mooring fees for floating docks set up by the Jianghai Customs in various sections of the Huangpu River have been increased from the 16th of this month, doubling the original rental price.</p>
<h3>Preventing Copper Coins from Leaking Overseas</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, stating that it had received a telegram that a certain party was buying copper coins at high prices and hoped to inform various businesses to strictly prevent it. The original letter stated, "The case is based on a telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which opened with: 'The case is based on a telegram from the headquarters of the XX War Zone Commander, which opened with: 'According to a report from the Chairman's telegram, the Japanese stationed in Suzhou are buying copper coins in various urban and rural areas, melting them into copper blocks, reaching 500 tons, and transporting them to Shanghai for transfer to Japan and other places. Please find ways to prevent the Japanese from buying and devise countermeasures to prevent the outflow of resources.' Therefore, the case of the Japanese buying silver and copper coins at high prices has been repeatedly telegraphed by the Zhejiang West Administrative Office to the Finance Department to notify the joint office of the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, and the General Bank of Zhejiang Local Banks, to find ways to collect and exchange them, and order the counties in Zhejiang West to advance funds to collect and exchange them, so as to prevent resources from being used by the Japanese. In addition to telegrap</p>
<h3>Home of the Owner of Hongchangshun Native Goods Store Thrown with a Hand Grenade</h3>
<p>Thrown from outside into the side room, fortunately no one was injured. The owner had previously been blackmailed and the case was solved.</p>
<p>Wu Wenkui, a native of Ningbo, is the manager of Hongchangshun Native Goods and Seafood Store at 115 Guangdong Road in this city. His home is located at 61 Renji Lane, 433 Xinza Road (i.e., Renji Lane). At approximately 11:20 last night, just as Wu and his family were about to retire for the night, someone suddenly threw a hand grenade into the back side room on the ground floor of the store. It exploded on the spot, with a thunderous sound. Everyone in the house was shocked and sought refuge, as if a great disaster had befallen them. When no further explosions were heard, they cautiously went to inspect the back side room. The smell of sulfur filled the air, and iron fragments were scattered everywhere. They realized that the explosive was a hand grenade. Fortunately, no one was living in the room, so no tragedy occurred. The homeowner immediately reported the incident to the Xinza Patrol Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate and collect the fragments, which were taken back to the station for analysis. According to Wu Wenkui, he received an anonymous letter on the 20th of this month, signed "Our Group of Friends," demanding 1,000 yuan. He immediately reported this to the patrol station for record. The patrol station investigated and solved the case last week. According to the suspects, this behavior was instigated by Gong Guiqing, but Gong is still at large and the case is not yet closed. Also, on the evening of the 26th of this month, around 11:30, when Wu himself returned home, he found a hand grenade tied to the doorknob of the back door with a grass rope. After discovering it, he immediately reported it to the patrol station, which removed it for investigation. As for why he had incurred the enmity of others, he was at a loss to explain.</p>

<h3>The New Economic Climate of "Free China"</h3>
<p>— Bai Min</p>
<p>Written by John Ahlers — Translated from the "Millard's Review" —</p>
<p>A significant amount of trade continues between Shanghai and "Free China." This trade is conducted through the remaining Chinese-controlled ports and to a small extent, across the Sino-Japanese front lines. In general, private Chinese finance in Shanghai continues to adhere to Chongqing directives, and the National Government's banks still exert some influence in the Shanghai foreign exchange market. However, most of Shanghai's commerce is currently based on trade with the occupied areas and the outside world. Today's Shanghai is so far removed from "Free China" that the war has erected numerous obstacles between Shanghai and the areas still administered by the Chinese government. Many businesses in this city have lost contact with the regions that continue to support armed resistance against Japan. Nevertheless, for the sake of Shanghai's interests, it is necessary to closely familiarize oneself with the general trends and details of the economic and financial developments in "Free China," which is now the location of the country's significant economic capabilities.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, I have spoken with several friends familiar with the situation in China, particularly regarding economic issues, who recently traveled extensively throughout "Free China" to conduct investigations. They all believe that despite the continuous Japanese incursions, the economic unification and progress of various regions in "Free China" continues unabated. The establishment of new economic lifestyles and values has overcome the damage inflicted by the Japanese and the fatigue of the prolonged war. They emphatically stated that the measures taken by the National Government in the past three or four months have generally proven beneficial to the economy and finance of "Free China."</p>
<p>Since its devaluation in July, the position of the legal tender (fapi) has been consolidated. During the first two years of the Sino-Japanese War, large amounts of fapi reserves flowed out, placing it under severe pressure. However, the large-scale pressure on foreign exchange in the Shanghai market has now ceased, preventing further significant outflows of fapi reserves. The balance of payments for "Free China" has been roughly equal for the past three months. "Free China" still has a large trade deficit, but remittances from overseas Chinese have completely offset this deficit, averaging nearly 100 million yuan per month for the past three months. In terms of foreign exchange, this amount is not less than the remittances sent back last year. Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou were previously important centers for remittances, but although the Japanese control these three cities, they have been unable to obtain the large amounts of foreign exchange remitted by overseas Chinese. The Chinese government's banks and overseas Chinese chambers of commerce have made effective arrangements to prevent the Japanese from obtaining this benefit.</p>
<p>The total amount of banknotes in circulation from the four Chinese government banks was just over 270 billion yuan on October 1st of this year. At the current Shanghai exchange rate, this circulation is equivalent to just over US$200 million. On the other hand, the foreign exchange and specie reserves of these four banks total about US$80 million. Therefore, according to the open market exchange rate, the percentage of fapi backed by reserves is nearly 40%. The Chinese government can certainly maintain an exchange rate of US$0.75 to US$0.85 in "Free China" for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Imports into "Free China" did not immediately decline with the outbreak of the European war. Although the number of ships from European belligerents arriving in China has decreased, the various supplies being shipped into China are piling up at the coastal ports due to congestion. There was originally concern that the French authorities might misappropriate some of these goods, but negotiations between Song Ziwen and the Governor-General of Vietnam resulted in a satisfactory resolution, and this concern has been alleviated. In the future, the scope of China's transit trade through the seaports will be less than it was not long ago, but France has allowed a considerable increase in China's transit trade through Saigon.</p>
<p>The new import ban promulgated in "Free China" in July has been fully effective. The Chinese government continues to issue special licenses allowing limited quantities of prohibited goods to be imported, with only a few exceptions. Licenses are routinely issued for goods that had already arrived at the seaports before the ban was announced. In general, there have been only a few sporadic complaints from the foreign trading community in "Free China" regarding China's new system for controlling foreign trade. The Chinese people in general seem to be preparing to take remedial measures to prevent foreign merchants from suffering excessive hardship, and the measure of allocating foreign exchange to pay for imports seems to be progressing satisfactorily.</p>
<p>From a Western perspective, the price level in "Free China" has increased greatly since the devaluation of the fapi in July. In the interior, the market prices of imported goods and goods made in Shanghai are mostly several times higher than in Shanghai. Even in cities such as Kunming and Guiyang, where the standard of living was previously particularly low, the standard of living according to Western standards has increased. On the other hand, this increase in prices has had little or no impact on the lives of the Chinese people. In the late summer and autumn of this year, most parts of "Free China" had abundant harvests, and the Chinese government and provincial authorities had to take measures to prevent low grain prices from harming farmers. In this situation, coupled with the current low exchange rate of the fapi, the maintenance of "Free China's" exports depends largely on transportation. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Pregnant Woman Kicked and Injured; Forensic Examination Ordered</h3>
<p>The three defendants continue to prevaricate and deny; the injured person testifies in court while injured.</p>
<p>Zhu Li, a 30-year-old woman from Tongzhou residing at 21 Tuofu Lane, North Henan Road, went to her younger brother Li Miaquan's house at 4 Tong Road on the afternoon of the 8th of this month to demand repayment of a 50-yuan loan. This led to an argument, and her brother Miaquan and his wife, Wang, violently beat her to the ground. Zhu Li, who is six months pregnant, was kicked in the abdomen by her brother.</p>
<p>At that time, Li Youchen and Chen Lianqi, who were standing by, aided and abetted the assault, stating that it would be fine to beat such a woman to death, and also punched her violently in the chest. She cried out for help, and someone reported it to the patrolling police, who came to arrest them. However, they all took the opportunity to escape. Zhu Li, being a weak woman, had no choice but to hire a car and go to the Refugee Hospital on North Xizang Road for treatment. The doctor found that her pregnancy was completely still and feared for her life. Zhu Li, realizing her younger brother Li Miaquan's</p>
<p>malice</p>
<p>, hired lawyer Ma Junshuo to report the incident to the Huisi Patrol Station. Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to arrest Li Miaquan and his wife, as well as the accomplice Chen Lianqi, and they were brought before the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. The day before yesterday, Magistrate Huang Risheng presided over the trial. Patrol Station lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the victim, Zhu Li, had been transferred from the Refugee Hospital on North Xizang Road to the specialized obstetrics hospital on Gubart Road in the French Concession for treatment, and had勉强 (forcefully) come to court to testify while injured. Lawyer Ma stated that it was difficult to determine whether Zhu Li's fetus could be saved, and that for</p>
<p>caution for life</p>
<p>, she was transferred to the obstetrics hospital in the French Concession, which had X-ray equipment to observe her fetus. Furthermore, she had suffered other serious injuries internally, was unable to eat, and was experiencing chest tightness and coughing up blood, etc. Subsequently, the victim, Zhu Li, slowly and with difficulty entered the witness stand, lowered her head and whispered that when she demanded repayment of the loan, her brother and his wife, Wang, knocked her down, and her brother Miaquan kicked her in the abdomen. The defendant Chen Lianqi had helped by punching her</p>
<p>chest with all force</p>
<p>. She requested that they be prosecuted. When questioned, all three defendants prevaricated and denied the charges. Magistrate Huang ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days. He also ordered the victim, Zhu Li, to go to the Forensic Medicine Department of the court on Weihaiwei Road to have her injuries examined. She respectfully complied, and her female companion helped her out of the courtroom and into the hired car, accompanied by lawyer Ma, to go to the Forensic Medicine Department for examination.</p>
<h3>Murder by Shooting Occurs in Qibao Town; One Dead, One Injured</h3>
<p>Wang A'nan (nickname "Eight Thousand Years"), a local resident of Wang Genglang in the southern part of Hongqiao Town, Shanghai, and a plasterer by trade, aged 22, and his neighbor Wang Hansheng, also known as A'gang, aged 24, encountered an enemy gunman who opened fire on them in front of the Great Temple Square in Qibao Town the day before yesterday afternoon. Wang A'nan was shot and killed on the spot, and Wang Hansheng was seriously injured. The assailant, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled in all directions. It is said that the reason for the murder was a dispute over the distribution of spoils.</p>
<h3>Barber Shop Apprentice Stabbed En Route; Life in Grave Danger</h3>
<p>Gu Changbao, a native of Yangzhou, aged 18, is currently an apprentice at Zhengji Barber Shop at 970 Haining Road. Yesterday at 12:10 pm, Gu went out of the shop and was suddenly stopped by a group of hooligans not far from the shop. One of them drew a sharp blade and stabbed Gu three times in the head. Blood flowed profusely, and he fell to the ground. The nearby police constable rushed to the scene, but the hooligans had scattered like birds and beasts. The injured person was taken to the hospital by car. It is reported that his life is in grave danger.</p>
<h3>Eviction Attempt Fails; Landlord Assaults Tenant; Woman Sues Landlord for Assault</h3>
<p>Zhu Shiqi, a local resident who previously worked in politics, and his wife, Zhu Lan, rent a room at 53, Lane 67, Ciyou Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai. The house is owned by Shen Pinqiu, a local resident who lives at 52 next door. The monthly rent is 3 yuan and 5 jiao. The house is an old-style bungalow that was rented before the August 13th Incident. Since the war, there has been a shortage of housing, and landlords generally want to raise rents or evict tenants in order to attract new tenants and collect high rents. Recently, the landlord of the house, Shen Pinzhang, has repeatedly issued eviction notices, ordering the Zhu couple to move out. However, Zhu argued that they had never been in arrears with rent and were willing to increase the rent slightly in accordance with market conditions. Shen insisted on refusing, demanding that Zhu vacate the house, leading to two quarrels, both of which were reported to the Xujiahui French Patrol Station but were not resolved. On the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, at 2:00 pm, another major conflict erupted between the two sides over the forced eviction. Shen Pinzhang, his wife Shen Wang Heying, and his mother Shen Shen attacked Zhu's wife, Lan, causing her injuries. Zhu Lan hired lawyer Song Yuntao to represent her and filed a private prosecution against Shen Pinzhang and others for assault in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, requesting that they be tried according to law. Magistrate Miao Qingbang held two hearings, but the defendants did not appear in court. Lawyer Lan Xupeng appeared on their behalf and raised the issue of jurisdiction, stating that the area previously belonged to the Chinese territory. The plaintiff had also gone to the hospital for treatment, and was represented by a lawyer in court. The court stated that the issue of jurisdiction was not applicable to criminal cases, and that the defendants should appear in court for questioning. The hearing was adjourned until the defendants appeared in court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Water Accumulation on Roads Again</h3>
<p>Due to recent high tides in the Huangpu River, sewage in low-lying roads bubbled up and flooded roads for two hours in the afternoon. Although it is currently the end of the autumn flood season, the tidal volume remains undiminished. This is due to the impact of the dredging of the Huangpu River, causing the riverbed to rise daily. Therefore, dredging the Huangpu River is an urgent task at present.</p>
<h3>Kuang Qian Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition</h3>
<p>Kuang Youhan, a famous landscape painter, is the eldest son of the renowned poet of the Hui Feng school. Qian Shangping, a calligrapher, is the son of Mr. Taixi. In recent years, they have been creating paintings and calligraphy in their spare time after teaching. Their creative spirits have soared, producing many excellent works. The two artists collaborated on paintings and calligraphy, initially for their own enjoyment. Friends who saw them encouraged them to exhibit their works to share their enjoyment with the public. The two artists reluctantly agreed and decided to exhibit their works at the Ningbo Native Association on the fourth floor of Qiaqing Road for three days, from October 29th to 31st. It is said that there will be more than a hundred pieces of landscapes, flowers, birds, seal script, running script, couplets, scrolls, and small collections on display, all of which are exquisite works. Art lovers should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Native Goods Trade Association, the content of the news published on the third page of the October 28th Shen Bao, regarding the "Dispute over Intercepting Vegetable Boats Has Been Mediated," is completely inaccurate. Our association members have always acted as agents for customers in buying and selling goods. Since the August 13th Incident, villagers have found it difficult to transport goods to Shanghai due to transportation difficulties. Our members, recognizing that vegetables are related to the food supply of the entire city, have overcome the difficulties and purchased directly from the production areas for direct transportation. In the past two months, there have been many disruptions along both the land and water routes through Touba. We have repeatedly reported this to the Water Police Station, and the head of the Water Police Station mediated a resolution: From 6:00 am every day, representatives from both sides will inquire about the owners of the arriving goods at the B渡橋(waiduqiao) harbor. If the goods are from our members' boats, they will still be allowed to unload at the Laozha Bridge pier and will not be intercepted. If the goods are transported to Shanghai by villagers, the owners can choose where to unload. If they do not comply, the police station will take action. Both sides agreed to comply with the mediation result without objection. The report in your newspaper stating that 40% of the vegetable boats arriving in Shanghai unloaded at Touba and 60% unloaded at Laozha Bridge is completely inconsistent with the facts. We are concerned that this rumor will cause misunderstandings. We have always admired your newspaper's impartiality and accurate reporting. We hereby entrust a representative to send this letter for correction. We extend our best regards.</p>

<h3>More Than a Hundred Bodies Found on the Beach in Baoshan County; Believed to Be Victims of the Xin Taigu Maru Disaster; Families of the Deceased Are Urged to Claim the Bodies</h3>
<p>The Xin Taigu Maru, belonging to the Shijin Steamship Co., Ltd., and represented by Nisshin Shipping Co., Ltd., sailed from Xin'gang to Shanghai on the 16th of this month, carrying passengers and cargo. Unfortunately, when it reached a point 12 nautical miles from Wusong, it was suddenly hit by a severe hurricane, causing the ship and cargo to sink completely. More than 300 passengers also suffered a tragic demise. It has now been learned that more than 130 bodies have been found on the beach in Baoshan County. They are believed to be victims of the Xin Taigu Maru disaster and have been recovered locally. Families of the deceased are urged to claim the bodies.</p>
<h3>Convicted Murderer Xu Baosheng's Appeal Rejected; Xu Cries Out in Court; Court States Appeal Still Possible</h3>
<p>Xu Baosheng, also known as Zhu Xingrong, a bandit from Songjiang, along with Zhu Zhangqing, broke into Shen Qilin's home at 576, Lane 39, Haifang Road on March 2nd of this year to steal clothing and escaped. Later, on May 23rd, they ganged up to rob the residents of 767 Xiaoshadu Road. When the victim, Wang Jintang, resisted, he was shot and killed by Xu. Xu was not apprehended until mid-August by the Chengdu Road Patrol Station and sent to the First Special District Court. After questioning, Judge Xiao sentenced Xu Baosheng to death for continuous gang robbery and intentional homicide, and deprived him of his political rights for life. Zhu Zhangqing was sentenced to seven years in prison for continuous gang armed robbery and breaking into a residence at night. Xu and Zhu refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Chief Judge Zhong Yuhua heard the case in the First Criminal Court and ruled that the appeal be rejected. Xu cried out in court. The court stated that if he did not accept the judgment, he could appeal to the Supreme Court in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation in the Underground</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>In European countries, especially England, France, Germany, and Italy, great attention has been paid to air raid and gas defense facilities in recent years. Therefore, whether in towns or villages, there are underground shelters. As soon as there is an air raid alert, people can go down to avoid the air raids. Now that the war between England, France, and Germany is in progress, these underground shelters will of course be used again when there are alerts. What are the movements and daily lives of people in underground shelters? This is also something we need to know. Therefore, I will write some of it briefly below:</p>
<p>Clothing: When you hear the air raid alert and go to the underground shelter, if you have time, bring one or two more pieces of clothing. Because the underground climate is cooler than the ground, especially at night, it is much cooler than during the day. Therefore, if possible, everyone, regardless of gender or age, should prepare for this. In addition, gas masks and gas-resistant rubber clothing should of course be taken along.</p>
<p>Food: When encountering severe air raids, you cannot immediately come out after entering the underground shelter. You may have to stay for a day or even several days. Therefore, there is a considerable storage of food, or it is brought in from the outside. The most suitable foods are milk and canned goods. As for drinking water, there is also a supply.</p>
<p>Housing: As mentioned above, sometimes air raid alerts come one after another, and you cannot come out immediately, so you have to stay there overnight. Except for large-scale underground shelters that have places to sleep, most do not have sleeping arrangements. At night, you have to wrap yourself in a blanket and sit on the ground. But there are always a few beds in the infirmary. If someone suddenly falls ill or is poisoned, they can lie on the bed for treatment. As for music rooms and radios, larger underground shelters have them, so you can relieve the boredom a bit.</p>
<p>Transportation: When there is an alert, movement is most important. You must accept the command of the military police or boy scouts. Strict order must be maintained, otherwise it will cause trouble. Walking into the underground shelter, movement is also not free and must be restricted. You are absolutely not allowed to go out until the alert is lifted, lest enemy aircraft discover the target. When the alert is lifted, you must also go out in an orderly manner and are not allowed to rush ahead, otherwise you will be punished by the military police.</p>
<h3>Promoting Domestically Produced Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>"The whole family is in the autumn wind, and the clothes for September have not yet been cut." This is a wonderful poem by Huang Zhongze, and this situation perfectly describes the current state of affairs for many families on the isolated island.</p>
<p>"It's getting cold! You need to add a piece of clothing." This sentence has almost become a common saying for many people, but with everything being expensive today, what should you add? Wool and woolen fabrics with prices marked in the shop windows are really jaw-dropping. Silks and silk fabrics are slightly cheaper, but they are still much more expensive than last year. Therefore, when clothes are needed and must be added, I want to advise the men and women on the isolated island to use domestic goods as much as possible!</p>
<p>I remember that in the past, educator Dr. Tai Shuangqiu advocated the native cloth movement. Although the native cloth movement was a very urgent method in principle, it was not followed by many people in practice, perhaps because the conditions of native cloth could not meet everyone's expectations. Originally, you can't be too practical when wearing clothes, especially in an environment like Shanghai, where aesthetic beauty is also essential. But I believe that there are many good-looking patterns and interesting designs of domestic cotton cloth in Shanghai's silk and cloth shops now. As long as everyone is willing to abandon the idea of "nothing but silk can be worn," then everyone wearing cotton cloth is not an impossible thing. Compatriots, the war of resistance in the front is so heated! How can we, on the isolated island, keep our hearts cold?</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Buddha Statues for Stabilizing Body and Mind</h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>In the atmosphere of public disturbance, surrounding the major roads of life on the isolated island; trends of neglecting the fundamental and pursuing the superficial in the situation, the strange event of sons killing their fathers in society, the soaring prices, and the storms and rain, are all aroused from the inability of humans to stabilize their body and mind.</p>
<p>Can Buddha statues stabilize society? This is a joke; but an exhibition of Buddha statues that evokes people's motivation to stabilize their body and mind is of course a social education.</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Huofo has devoted his life to painting Buddhas for nearly forty years, and is regarded as the master of copying Buddha statues in East Asia, along with Bai Longshan. China, Japan, and the various islands of Southeast Asia have all praised his deep understanding of the solemn essence of Buddha statues. Now Mr. Longshan has returned to the mountain of Tao, and Mr. Qian is the only remaining fruit!</p>
<p>In addition to painting Buddhas, Mr. Huofo is also careful to collect historical materials. Therefore, the fragments and remnants obtained from the retired officials of the late Qing Dynasty and the powerful figures of the government, which are not available for purchase by the world, will also be exhibited with the Buddha statues. This is to let the readers know that the success or failure of major events in the world has a cause and effect.</p>
<p>It is reported that Mr. Qian's exhibition includes a large number of valuable works from China and abroad, which have considerable value in terms of national history, society, and customs; there are also coins from past dynasties, peculiar letters, match trademarks, cigarette cards, autographs of celebrities, and books from outside the world. He will dedicate his forty years of collection to the public, with the intention of subtly transforming the desire of people in society to compete for power and profit into stability.</p>
<h3>A Week's Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In the past few days, Dazha crabs have been launched on the market in large quantities. Whether in big companies, small hotels, or street corners, there are several large crab baskets to be seen. Men and women surround them in large numbers, some watching idly, some buying, it's really lively. As the saying goes, "nine females, ten males," the ninth month of the lunar calendar is the best time to eat female crabs, but although the west wind has risen, the weather is not yet cold, and it is still too early to eat crabs. Whether female or male, they all feel too thin, and the meat is not very firm, but the prices are extra expensive, with some selling for one yuan and one yuan and a half per crab. A basket of crabs can simply cost less than the two meat and two vegetarian dishes on my menu. Since I am advocating economy, of course I won't eat this uneconomical crab; however, seeing crabs without eating them is inevitable, and I am very interested. I like to eat crab roe, but my affection for steaming crabs is not so great. Yesterday, I went to the vegetable market and bought eight small crabs for four jiao. After steaming them, I got a bowl of crab roe, and then I added pork, sliced into silk, for one jiao, and beat two eggs in it, and then added five fen of chives. After being mixed with water chestnut flour and fried, I actually fried two bowls of crab soup. Our whole family ate it with relish, and I think this kind of economical way of eating is really above eating steamed crabs.</p>

<h3>The Erudition of a Waiter</h3>
<p>Koo Hung-ming was a famous figure in our country, the first Chinese person to master more than ten foreign languages. He not only understood them but could also speak them fluently. On one occasion, at a celebration banquet for the successful conclusion of the European War, he greeted the representatives from various countries in their respective languages, which naturally astonished everyone present and marveled at his erudition. At that moment, a Chinese waiter approached with a menu and, pointing to an unusual dish name, asked, "Mr. Koo! Would you like this dish?" Koo looked puzzled and replied, "What kind of dish is this? I don't recognize it." Someone then joked that the waiter was more erudite than him, as the waiter knew the unusual foreign dish names on the menu, while Koo did not. (Wang Pei)</p>

<h3>Landscape Painting of Late Autumn</h3>
<p>— Tian Ma</p>
<p>—Speaking of Knitting in the Cold Weather—</p>
<p>"Autumn rain and autumn wind sadden people," using a personification, someone once symbolized autumn with a widow. Some love the youthful spring, and some love the heroic and passionate summer, but few love this widow full of melancholy! Indeed, doesn't the autumn wind that "blows the paulownia leaves down" sound like weeping in the dead of night? Autumn is indeed desolate.</p>
<p>But wait, when you see a girl holding a ball of yarn, knitting delicate and exquisite items stitch by stitch, this "desolation" will truly be chased away without a trace. Of course, the yarn itself and its colors can make people feel a sense of warmth, and even the rhythmic up-and-down movements of those slender fingers can stir a little warmth in the "desolate" heart. Especially if you have the chance to meet Miss Ni from the yarn department of the Sincere Company, this "warmth" will surpass springtime.</p>
<p>Her name is Xiuyue, her bright eyes, her white teeth, her nimble fingertips... how charming, this girl set against the backdrop of colorful yarn, she is a flower, a chrysanthemum adorning the autumn scenery with her unique elegance.</p>
<p>Her job at Sincere Company is to answer customers' questions about knitting. Her working hours are from 2 pm to 6 pm every day. Although she has a bit of a "mischievous young lady" style, she is very serious when it comes to work.</p>
<p>Every day, besides assisting Miss Huang Peiying in teaching knitting courses on the "Glass Radio Station" for forty minutes, she spends the entire afternoon answering questions about how to cast on, how to match colors, and how to knit certain patterns, practically surrounded by ladies. She tirelessly repeats the instructions, and her fingers are constantly taking over Mrs. So-and-so's knitting to do a few stitches, and then showing Miss So-and-so how to knit a pattern. Sometimes she is simply overwhelmed. Someone, unable to bear it, advises her not to explain so thoroughly and clearly, to save some energy. But she says, "How can I do that? This is the right that customers are entitled to, and I have to fulfill my duty. You men wouldn't understand the knitting work; if you knit a stitch wrong, it would be troublesome." So she continues to serve with gentleness and patience.</p>
<p>However, she sometimes says with a sigh, "It can be said that it's a hard task for a young girl to know how to knit. Take a close-fitting vest like yours, it has to be knitted stitch by stitch. Count how many stitches there are in total! Without patience, it's really impossible to knit. The person who wears it only feels the warmth, but does he know the hard work of our ten fingers?"</p>
<p>Finally, I must also tell you that although she is only nineteen years old, the enviable title of "Yarn Mama" has spread far and wide, because she always keeps a large doll by her side to answer inquiries about children's clothing. Putting on a hat one moment, putting on clothes the next, she appears so skilled and exudes great "motherly love"!</p>

<h3>Donating to Relatives</h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>Having the receipt book in hand, I hesitated a bit. Although it was just a book with five receipts, twenty-five dollars was really hard to come by. Donating dimes and quarters, I was confident I could scrape together seven or eight dollars, but five dollars per receipt, I feared no one would even donate half a receipt's worth. The situation was clear. After thinking it over, I just couldn't find a way.</p>
<p>Three or four days passed, and I couldn't even conjure up one "patron" in my mind. I remembered for previous disaster relief and charity donation drives, I had at least twenty "patrons," but they were just "small fry" who gave dimes and quarters. Now, asking them to contribute three or five dollars each was simply a dream. As for donating dimes and quarters, the receipt couldn't even fit their names, and even if it could, the donors wouldn't want it. It was a real dilemma. Actually, I couldn't blame them. They only had the capacity to give dimes and quarters. Therefore, I decided not to ask them and to pick a "wealthy" "patron" instead.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, I thought of one, a relative of mine. In previous donation drives, he always gave one silver dollar. And he had quite a bit of money, but it seemed difficult to broach the subject. Relatives and friends often exchange favors, not money. Although I wasn't borrowing money from him, based on the previous donation experience, it was really because of my personal connection. This time, with "it's me again" asking for a donation, I wondered how big my personal connection would have to be to be appropriate. To chatter on and on, explaining the causes and consequences, that should be done by "donation beggars" on the street, not by an eager person like us who wants to open their mouth. Furthermore, if he were willing to donate, but just did it perfunctorily, how could I argue for more? Stepping back, if he refused, could I accuse him of lacking righteousness? All the ceremonial connections between relatives would be completely swept away. I really couldn't bear this responsibility. I really wanted to say, "To hell with it," but my heart told me, "You would never do that!"</p>
<p>Forcing myself, I decided to offer a lucky message and present the receipt book:</p>
<p>"Ha, bothering you again... I really have no choice, but I can't get past it... please help me!"</p>
<p>"What, donating again?"</p>
<p>A big "three" flashed before my eyes. How could I not understand, he had heard these words for the third time. I quickly clicked my tongue:</p>
<p>"Ah, there's really no way... This is a donation for the soldiers. This winter will probably be very cold, and they lack clothing. Each of us has to be responsible for a few sets. I really can't think of anything, so I always come to you, ha..." I said a lot of things without even thinking, my face a little flushed.</p>
<p>He looked at the receipt as if suspecting I had forged it, suddenly his hand went into his pocket... My heart jumped.</p>
<p>"Write down one dollar for me!"</p>
<p>I jumped again.</p>
<p>"One dollar is not good for writing a receipt... Five dollars can be counted as one set, ten dollars for two sets..."</p>
<p>"Haha, I won't give five dollars, I won't give five dollars!"</p>
<p>"One dollar is not good for writing a receipt!" I tried to tempt him: "With a receipt, your name can be printed in the newspaper in the future..."</p>
<p>"I don't need a receipt. You take the money, and if someone else donates four dollars, give the receipt to that person."</p>
<p>In this way, I couldn't say another word. I wasn't confused, this was fundamentally a perfunctory act. This one dollar was still the value of my personal connection! I had a plan beforehand, and it was exactly as I had expected. Although I didn't know if he would resent me for this one dollar, ruining the ceremonial relationship between relatives, I simply didn't dare to think further.</p>
<p>Now, I held a one-dollar banknote and a receipt book without a single word written on it. It was really a bit "awkward." This only door was closed, so where was a second door? Even if I had money to make up the four dollars, it would still be "perfunctory." However, since I didn't have money and was unwilling to be "perfunctory," what should I do?</p>
<p>I remembered that in the previous donation drive, a friend of mine went to his relatives' places and raised fifty dollars. Although it wasn't that much, I still didn't understand, was it because he had many generous relatives, or did he have a "knack"? Or did he simply ruin the relationship between relatives and forcibly donate? At least, at least, both sides being just right (an extremely complex statement) combine to produce good results, while I, this unlucky ghost, can't touch any of the "heavenly timing, geographical advantage, and human harmony," and in the end, my conscience has to drink a cold northwest wind for a while!</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>It's strange! People's conversations are like creeping grass, spreading wherever they go. They were just on the road, saw newly picked chestnuts from the villagers, and started talking like this. From osmanthus and chestnuts, they got to grafting, from fruit tree grafting, they talked about intermarriage. If they continued to talk, who knows where they would end up? Therefore, people who travel alone are most afraid of being lonely. If they have two or three companions, chatting and talking, that would be much more enjoyable. In a moment, they arrived in Suzhou and drove the car straight to Wu Junsu's dormitory at Soochow University. They had already come once before, so this time, they were familiar with the road. The Junsu sisters, because it had been agreed upon the day before, were waiting for them at home. Fortunately, she didn't have classes on Saturday afternoon, and Wu Junke was also free this afternoon. When they arrived at her house, they saw that besides the two sisters, there was another female guest there. The two Miss He's naturally didn't know this female guest, but Zhu Airen seemed somewhat familiar with her, as if she had met her somewhere. She looked about twenty-three or twenty-four years old, her body was not tall, but she showed a healthy and beautiful demeanor. A kind of alert and lively expression unconsciously flowed out. She was wearing a riding outfit. But she didn't come on horseback, just looking outside Wu Junsu's house, there was a motorcycle parked next to the flowerbed, you could tell that this lady was the owner of the motorcycle. Introduced by Wu Junsu, the two Miss He's learned that the lady's surname was Shao, her name was Huihua, and she was from Jinhua, Zhejiang. She was a field reporter for a Shanghai newspaper, and she and Ms. Jin Danyun were the closest and best sisters. This time, she was also going to Shanghai to attend Jin Danyun's wedding banquet, and she came to Wu Junsu's place to travel together. At this time, Zhu Airen suddenly remembered that once, at a banquet in Shanghai, she had met her. And her seat happened to be next to hers. She had warmly asked Zhu Airen how many years she had been back in the country? How long she had been in the United States? She also remembered that her name was indeed Shao Huihua. It turned out that this Miss Shao was really an outstanding person. She could drive a car, fly a plane, row a boat, ride a horse, climb a mountain, ice skate, swim, and play ball, she was proficient in everything. These were all physical matters, and her intelligence was also very rare. When she met a person, she could know what kind of person that person was. And her memory was very strong. When Airen saw her this time, she only felt very familiar, and couldn't remember who she was for a moment. But Miss Shao remembered that once at a banquet, she had met Dr. Zhu, and immediately said it. (196)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Laborers' Lives in Pudong, Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xie Tianshen</p>
<p>Currently, in Shanghai, besides the Caojiadu area, which has become a factory district, there is also a factory district located in Yangshupu, Pudong. There are more than forty large-scale factories there, and no less than hundreds of small ones. The total number of laborers is over ten thousand.</p>
<p>Although it is only a stone's throw from the central area, it has been divided into two realms by the times. People living in Henan (south of the Suzhou Creek) are largely out of touch with people in Hebei, so they are not very clear about the living conditions of the laborers in the Pudong district? I have a friend who works in a factory in the Yangshupu district, and he briefly described the general situation of the laborers' lives:</p>
<p>The issue of where to live is the easiest thing to solve in life, but there is one drawback, which is the lack of electricity and running water. If you need water and electricity, you have to pay extra water and electricity fees to achieve the goal. The workers do not have the ability to pay for electricity, so they use kerosene lamps instead of light.</p>
<p>In terms of food, it was still manageable half a year ago. In recent months, prices have soared. In the past, a catty of raw oil cost two dimes, but now it costs no less than six dimes. These daily food materials of local products are not affected by foreign exchange, but are due to the heavy taxes and levies collected layer by layer by the people, and the market is monopolized by unscrupulous merchants, resulting in an unspeakable blow and pain added to the laborers. Moreover, the Japanese yen is the main currency in Hongkou? Even counterfeit money with no credibility actually prevails and floods the market. The value of using counterfeit money there is actually higher than that of the national currency. Some hot-blooded merchants with a sense of national identity also accept the national currency when buying and selling goods. (It is also common to use the national currency to buy and sell goods in the Hongkou district, but it is very common to refuse to accept it. You can't argue with reason, otherwise you will suffer a lot.) According to the current level of living, even the entire month's salary is not enough to cope with the whole month's food.</p>
<p>Their daily working hours are usually ten hours, and wages are calculated on a daily basis, ranging from one dollar, eight dimes, or one dollar and two dimes per day. Working in the factory, they are abused by foremen or senior staff who act as accomplices, and if they are not satisfied, they are often punched and kicked. Under the constraints of that environment and the problem of making a living, they have to swallow their anger.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a group of conscienceless people who take advantage of the opportunity to open many gambling dens near the factory, engaging in absorbing the money easily earned from the laborers' blood and sweat. For this reason, many tragedies have been staged in the families of many laborers.</p>
<p>Those laborers who are struggling on the brink of starvation are absolutely not free to act, and their lives have no guarantee. They do not want to be restrained, but because of the drive to make a living, they put their lives in a dangerous situation, but they are all trying to make a turn for the better.</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>Southern Prodigy</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Tailoring a script specifically to accommodate an actor's skills has become a fashion in Hollywood, but this is putting the cart before the horse. For example, Sonya Henie's skating films are now difficult to continue. Similarly, after "Leaving Home for the Stage" and "Rainbow Shadow Flower Sound," Baby Beling also has no outstanding new works. If this goes on, a lucky newcomer will still be destroyed by the discoverer's own hands. At the same time, actors themselves should continue to learn and explore. An actor's (and other technical personnel) success is definitely not created by chance.</p>
<p>"Southern Prodigy" has placed too much emphasis on grand chorus, but it has not opened a new path for Baby Beling. As a result, Baby Beling has lost the opportunity to act.</p>
<p>The director starts with the singing of the serfs and ends with the singing of the serfs, echoing each other. This should be the best technique for handling song films (especially those that focus on grand chorus), but after the serfs are transferred from Reid (the plantation owner) to Martin's control, the friendship between Baby Beling and Cotton (the old serf), and the scene of Martin echoing the serfs, were all hastily glossed over, so that the whole film became a fragmented state, and the prior and later echoes of the grand chorus were also weak.</p>
<p>As for the main theme of the play, to take the serfs back from the new owner, it is nothing more than cheap sympathy.</p>
